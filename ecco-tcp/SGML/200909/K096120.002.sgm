<P>The&s;e travels were printed at Peter&s;burg, in the German language, and con&s;i&s;t of five quarto volumes, but as the chief part of the&s;e volumes is rather an enquiry into the natural hi&s;tory of the country, and as &s;uch would be tedious to the general reader, particularly &s;o to an Engli&s;h one, we have omitted what is dry and unintere&s;ting; though at the &s;ame time we have followed our author throughout his tour, and laid his

<HEAD>The AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE FIRST PART OF HIS TOUR.</HEAD>
<P>THE commands of her Imperial Maje&s;ty to the Royal Academy of Sciences at <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> i&s;&s;ued &s;ome few years back, for the benefit of &s;cience, and the preparations made in con&s;equence, are too well-known to the world, to be here repeated. I had the honour of being numbered among tho&s;e, who were to carry tho&s;e commands into execution. By the plan fir&s;t de&s;igned, the natural curio&s;ity of the public would not have been gratified, it being propo&s;ed not to publi&s;h any part of this tour till the return of the gentlemen engaged in it: but, that love of &s;ci|ence, which is one of the great ornaments of <HI>Count Orlow,</HI> director of the academy, induced him to gra|tify the literary world, by forwarding the publication of the&s;e travels.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t part of my journal contains an accurate, but un&s;tudied account of the mo&s;t important ob&s;erva|tions, in the fir&s;t two years of my tour. Without la|bouring to enhance the value of the&s;e &s;heets, by dwel|ling on the pains I have taken, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that I paid the greate&s;t attention to every thing I met with, and I hope my work, though de&s;titute of the embel|li&s;hments of language, will not be cla&s;&s;ed among the
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
number of trifling and &s;uperfluous accounts. De&s;crip|tions of unknown countries, like the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e I have travelled through, mu&s;t be entertaining to the enlightened reader, let the &s;tile be as indifferent as it may. The characteri&s;tic of a book of travels is the fidelity of the narrative. What fell under my own ob&s;ervation, I have been particularly exact in, and in tho&s;e accounts I received from others, I have endea|voured to keep clo&s;e to truth. Had I had more lei|&s;ure, I might have been more ample in my remarks; but, as the bu&s;ine&s;s of my journey, did not allow me more than two months, to review my papers and ar|range them for the public eye, I tru&s;t, they will meet with indulgence.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit &s;aying, that I have not entered into a very de&s;criptive detail of places &s;ituated near capital cities, as I would not dwell on things well known al|ready; for this rea&s;on, in my de&s;cription of &s;ome parts of the government of Orenburg, I have profited by the topography of that place, written by Mr. <HI>Ryt&s;chloff.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t further add, that I was directed to mea&s;ure my journey by the Ru&s;&s;ian <HI>Wer&s;t</HI> or <HI>Ver&s;t,</HI> which is equal to 500 fathoms, each fathom &s;even feet Engli&s;h; of cour&s;e, a <HI>Ver&s;t</HI> is about three-quarters of an Engli&s;h mile; and, with re&s;pect to weight, I have u&s;ed the Ru&s;|&s;ian <HI>Pud</HI> of forty pounds, which is equal to thirty-&s;ix pounds Engli&s;h.</P>

<P>JUNE 21, 1768. Certain bu&s;ine&s;s and the nece&s;|&s;ary preparations for our journey delayed us till towards the end of June. However, at la&s;t, being properly equipped, <HI>Me&s;&s;rs. Lepechin</HI> and <HI>Gulden&s;teat,</HI> gentlemen, who were appointed to accompany me throughout my tour, &s;et out, one rather before the other,
<PB N="8" REF="9">
and I followed with my attendants on the 21&s;t of June. The in&s;pection of certain places on this &s;ide of Mo&s;|cow, was allotted to the&s;e gentlemen, and I was or|eered to A&s;trachan; my &s;horte&s;t road therefore was to pur&s;ue my way to Mo&s;cow, and to make all the po&s;|&s;ible &s;peed which my heavy baggage and a change of hor&s;es only every 50, 60, or 70 ver&s;ts would allow, in order to reach the di&s;tant parts I was going to, in a favourable &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>My journey was chiefly that of a botani&s;t and a mi|neralogi&s;t, of cour&s;e, my attention was mo&s;tly taken up with examining the &s;oil and the plants of the coun|tries through which I pa&s;&s;ed, but as a de&s;cription of the&s;e would be tire&s;ome to the general reader, I &s;hall omit noticing them here, and &s;peak only of the face of the country, the towns and the people, in the pla|ces where I went.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 2. On the 2d of July I found my&s;elf at Twer, about 388 Engli&s;h miles from Peter&s;burg, from whence we fir&s;t &s;at out. This was a few years back, a mi&s;erable wretched village, con&s;i&s;ting only of a few poor huts, but is now, under the patro|nage of the Empre&s;s, rai&s;ed to an elegant &s;tately city. It &s;tands on the banks of the river Wolga, in which a great deal of fi&s;h is caught and conveyed in well-boats to Mo&s;cow and Peter&s;burg, by the river Oka.
<PB N="9" REF="10">
The fields here are well cultivated, and the place &s;eemingly every where in a flouri&s;hing condition.</P>
<P>'Twer,' &s;ays Mr. <HI>Cox,</HI> who travelled with Lord Herbert, in 1778, is divided
<Q>into the old and new town. The former is on one &s;ide of the Volga, and con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t of wooden cottages; the latter, about fifteen years ago, was little better; but being, in 1763, fortunately de&s;troyed by fire, it has ri&s;en with lu&s;tre from it's a&s;hes. The Empre&s;s, no &s;ooner in|formed of this calamity than &s;he, ordered a regular and beautiful plan of a new town to be &s;ketched by an eminent architect, and enjoined that all the hou&s;es &s;hould be re-con&s;tructed in conformity to this model. She erected at her own expence, the governor's hou&s;e, the bi&s;hop's palace, the courts of ju&s;tice, the new exchange, the pri&s;on, and &s;everal other public edi|fices, and offered to every per&s;on who would engage to build a hou&s;e with brick, a loan of &pound;300. Eng|li&s;h, for twelve years, without intere&s;t. The money advanced on this occa&s;ion was &pound;60,000, and &s;he has &s;ince remitted one-third of the &s;um. The &s;treets, which are broad and long, i&s;&s;ue in a &s;traight line from an octagon in the centre. The hou&s;es of this octagon, and of the principal &s;treets are of brick, &s;tuccoed white, and form a very magnificent ap|pearance. This town is not yet fini&s;hed, but when completed, will con&s;i&s;t of two octagons, with &s;everal
<PB N="10" REF="11">
&s;treets leading to them, and inter&s;ecting each other at right angles.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Here is an eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;eminary under the in|&s;pection of the bi&s;hop, and admits 600 &s;tudents, a &s;chool of 200 burgher's children, and an academy for the education of the young nobility, admitting 120 &s;cholars. The city is a place of con&s;iderable com|merce, and the river is covered with boats. It owes it's principal trade to it's advantageous &s;ituation, be|ing near the conflux of two rivers, along which are conveyed all the goods and merchandize &s;ent by water from Siberia and the &s;outhern provinces, to Peter&s;burg.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Volga, which is the large&s;t river in Europe, ri&s;es about eighty miles from Twer, and begins to be navigable a few miles above the town. It is there, about the breadth of the Thames at Henley, but exceedingly &s;hallow; when it joins the Twerze it is broader, deeper and more rapid. The ri&s;ing &s;pirit of commerce, within the&s;e few years, has en|crea&s;ed the people much; they are about 10,000 in number. The city lies in the middle of a large plain, and the country, round, produces in great abun|dance, wheat, rye, barley, oats, buck-wheat, hemp, flax, and all kinds of vegetables. It's fore&s;ts yield oak, birch, alder, poplar, mountain-a&s;h, pines, firs, junipers, &amp;c.</Q></P>

<P><PB N="11" REF="13"><HI>Mo&s;cow, July</HI> 14. From Twer, we went to Mo&s;cow, about the di&s;tance of 125 miles, where I was de|tained till the 14th of July. The river Mo&s;cow, on which the city &s;tands, is remarkable for the quantity of petrified &s;ea-&s;ub&s;tances, every where found in the environs of this place, &s;ome inches deep in the banks. Here are al&s;o &s;ome phy&s;ic-gardens, and pains have been taken to cultivate the genuine rhubarb. A large field has been &s;own with it, and there is little doubt, as it &s;eems to thrive in this climate, but, that with proper attention, they will bring it to &s;uch per|fection, as to exceed that of the Chine&s;e. Experiments have been made of it in Scotland. Choro&s;chowa, a village not far from Mo&s;cow, belongs to the crown, and is renowned for it's breed of hor&s;es.</P>
<P>'The city of Mo&s;cow," &s;ays Mr. <HI>Cox,</HI>
<Q>lies in the form of a cre&s;cent, &s;tretched to a prodigious extent, and innumerable churches, towers, gilded &s;pires and domes, white, red and green buildings glittering in the &s;un, form a mo&s;t &s;plendid appear|ance, and yet the&s;e are &s;trangely contra&s;ted by an intermixture of numberle&s;s wooden hovels. We cro&s;&s;ed the river Mo&s;cow on a floating raft, fa&s;tened to each bank, which the Ru&s;&s;ians call a living bridge, from it's bending under the carriage. This city is certainly the large&s;t in Europe, it's circumference, within the rampart which enclo&s;es the &s;uburbs, being exactly thirty-nine ver&s;ts, or twenty-&s;ix miles, (nearly
<PB N="12" REF="14">
equal to that of Pekin in China, which including it's &s;uburbs, mea&s;ures twenty-&s;ix miles and three-quar|ters,) but it is built in &s;o &s;traggling and disjointed a manner, that it's population in no degree corre&s;ponds with it's extent; it is calculated to have 277,535 inhabitants. The &s;treets are in general exceedingly long and broad, &s;ome paved, others, particularly in the &s;uburbs, are formed with trunks of trees, or are boarded with planks like the floor of a room; wretched hovels are blended with large palaces, and cottages of one &s;tory &s;tand next to the mo&s;t &s;uperb and &s;tately man&s;ions; many brick &s;tructures are covered with wooden tops; &s;ome of the wooden hou&s;es are painted, others have iron doors and roofs. The churches are built in a peculiar &s;tile of archi|tecture, &s;ome have domes of copper, others of tin, gilt or painted green, and many roofed with wood. In a word, &s;ome parts of this va&s;t city have the ap|pearance of a &s;eque&s;tered de&s;art, other quarters, of a populous town, &s;ome of a contemptible village, others of a great capital.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The river Mo&s;cow, from which the city takes it's name, flows through it in a winding channel, but excepting in &s;pring, is only navigable for rafts. We hired, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Cox,</HI> a carriage, during our &s;tay at Mo&s;cow, it was a chariot and four hor&s;es of different colours, we could get no other; the coachman and po&s;tillion were dre&s;&s;ed like the pea&s;ants, with high
<PB N="13" REF="15">
cylindrical hats, the former, with a long beard and &s;heep-&s;kin robe, &s;at upon the box, the latter, in a coar&s;e, drugget garb, rode upon the off-hor&s;e, and behind the carriage, was an enormous &s;ack of hay. This is the cu&s;tomary vehicle of the city. They dont put up their hor&s;es here from morning to night, but about dinner-time, turn them loo&s;e into the court|yards of the hou&s;es where the ma&s;ter dines, and leave them to feed on the hay they carry with them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The palace at Mo&s;cow, is a va&s;t a&s;&s;emblage of nu|merous buildidgs, di&s;tributed into many &s;treets and re&s;embling a town, and all the timber u&s;ed in the&s;e and other buildings, are wholly fa&s;hioned with an axe, carpenters here never u&s;ing a &s;aw, a chi&s;el, or a plane. The palace gardens are of con&s;iderable ex|tent, and contain &s;ome good gravel walks; in &s;ome parts, the grounds are laid out in a plea&s;ing and natural manner, but in general, the old &s;tyle of gar|dening prevailed, and continually pre&s;ented us with rows of chipped yew-trees, long &s;traight canals, and a profu&s;ion of prepo&s;terous &s;tatues.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We &s;oon cea&s;ed to be &s;urprized that our carriage had four hor&s;es, nothing being more common than to meet the nobility with complete &s;ets driving about the &s;treets. The hackney-coaches are &s;tationed in the &s;treets as with us, are without tops, have mo&s;tly four wheels, and are provided either with a long
<PB N="14" REF="16">
bench, or one, two, or three &s;eparate &s;eats, like arm|ed chairs, placed &s;ideways, and their fares are &s;o rea&s;onable, that &s;ervants often take a coach, when they have any di&s;tance to go. The coachamn ge|nerally drives a full trot, at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nothing can exceed the ho&s;pitality of the Ru&s;&s;ians; we could never pay a morning vi&s;it to any nobleman without being detained to dinner: the principal per|&s;ons of di&s;tinction keep open tables, and have mu&s;ic during dinner. They have al&s;o a great number of retainers and dependants mixed with their &s;ervants, who &s;tand occa&s;ionally round their lord's chair, and &s;eem highly plea&s;ed, if di&s;tingui&s;hed by a nod or a &s;mile. At an entertainment given us by a Ru&s;&s;ian nobleman, we were particularly &s;truck with the quan|tity and quality of the fruit which was brought in, after dinner, pines, peaches, apricots, grapes, pears, cherries, none of which can be there obtained but in hot-hou&s;es, and yet &s;erved up in the greate&s;t pro|fu&s;ion. There was a delicious &s;pecies of &s;mall me|lon, &s;ent by land-carriage from A&s;tracan, though at the di&s;tance of 1,000 miles. The&s;e melons &s;ome|times co&s;t five pounds each, and at other times are &s;old for half-a-crown. One in&s;tance of elegance which di&s;tingui&s;hed the de&s;ert, and which had the prettie&s;t effect imaginable, mu&s;t not be omitted. At the upper and lower end of the table were placed two
<PB N="15" REF="17">
china va&s;es, containing cherry-trees in full leaf and fruit hanging on the boughs, which was gathered by the company; we ob&s;erved, al&s;o a curious &s;pecies of apple, not uncommon here, it is &s;omething larger than a golden pippin, has the colour and tran&s;parency of pale amber, and has an exqui&s;ite flavour. The tree thrives here in the open air, without any particular attention to it's culture, but degenerates in other countries. The Ru&s;&s;ian nobles di&s;play a great de|gree of grandeur and magnificence in their hou&s;es, dome&s;tics, and way of living. Their palaces, at and near Mo&s;cow, are &s;tupendous piles of buildings, and in the country they live like independent princes; as the feudal barons in early times, they have their &s;epa|rate courts of ju&s;tice, and govern their va&s;&s;als with an almo&s;t unlimited &s;way.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At the furthe&s;t extremity of the &s;uburbs, in a &s;e|que&s;tered &s;pot, is a kind of Vauxhall, the proprietor of which is an Engli&s;hman, by name <HI>Mattocks,</HI> to whom the Empre&s;s has given an exclu&s;ive patent for all plays and public ma&s;querades for ten years. Here is a fine rotunda, the place was well illumina|ted, and the entrance money four &s;hillings.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The places of divine wor&s;hip at Mo&s;cow are ex|ceedingly numerous; including chapels, there are above 1,000. There are 484 public churches, 199 of the&s;e are built with brick, the re&s;t are of wood.
<PB N="16" REF="18">
The former are &s;tuccoed or white-wa&s;hed, the latter are painted red.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There are two convents in this city, one a nunne|ry, and the other a mona&s;tery for men. In the prin|cipal chapel of the nunnery, lie buried &s;everal Cza|rinas and prince&s;&s;es of the imperial family, in &s;tone coffins, ranged on the floor in rows; each coffin is covered with a crim&s;on or black velvet pall, edged with gold or &s;ilver lace, and embroidered on the middle with a cro&s;s, over which, on fe&s;tival days, are laid other coverings of gold or &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue, richly &s;tudded with pearl or precious &s;tones. Having &s;een the chapel, &amp;c. as we entered the antichamber, the abbe&s;s &s;truck the floor with a cane, when in&s;tanta|neou&s;ly a chorus of about twenty nuns received us with hymns, and continued &s;inging as long as we &s;taid.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The churches of Mo&s;cow are divided into three parts, the ve&s;tibule, the body, and the &s;anctuary, re&s;embling our chancel. In the body are generally four pillars &s;upporting the dome, and the&s;e pillars are decorated with paintings of the Virgin Mary and Saints. The mo&s;t magnificent church in Mo&s;cow, has an enormous chandelier of ma&s;&s;ive &s;ilver hanging in the centre of the dome, and weighing 2,940 pounds, it was made in England, and a pre&s;ent from the prime-mini&s;ter of Ru&s;&s;ia. The &s;kreen that di|vides
<PB N="17" REF="19">
the &s;anctuary from the body of the church is in many parts covered with plates of &s;olid &s;ilver and gold, richly worked. Among the many paintings which cover the inner-walls, is the head of the Vir|gin, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been painted by St. Luke, and greatly celebrated in this country, for it's power of working miracles. It's face is almo&s;t black, it's head ornamented with a glory of precious &s;tones, and it's hands and body are gilt.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mo&s;cow is the centre of the inland commerce of Ru&s;&s;ia, and connects the trade between Eu|rope and Siberia. The only navigation to this city is formed by the Mo&s;cow river, communi|cating by the Wolga or Volga, but as the Mo&s;|cow is only navigable in &s;pring, on the melting of the &s;nows, the principal merchandize is conveyed to and from this place in winter, upon &s;ledges. The whole retail commerce is carried on in the Khitaigo|rod or centre of the city, where, according to Ru&s;|&s;ian cu&s;tom, all the &s;hops, without hou&s;es, are collect|ed in one &s;pot. The place is like a fair or market, con&s;i&s;ting of many rows of brick buildings, with alleys between them. The trade&s;man comes to his &s;hop in the morning, remains there all day, and re|turns home to his family in the afternoon. Every trade has it's &s;eparate department, and they who &s;ell the &s;ame goods have booths adjoining to each other. Furs and &s;kins form the mo&s;t con&s;iderable article of
<PB N="18" REF="20">
commerce in Mo&s;cow, and the &s;hops which vend them occupy &s;everal &s;treets.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Among the curio&s;ities of Mo&s;cow, I mu&s;t not omit the market for the &s;ale of hou&s;es. It is held in a large open, &s;pace in one of the &s;uburbs, and ex|hibits a great variety of <HI>ready-made</HI> hou&s;es, thickly &s;cattered upon the ground. The man who wants a dwelling repairs to this &s;pot, mentions the number of rooms he requires, examines the different timbers, which are regularly numbered, and bargains for that which &s;uits him be&s;t. The hou&s;e is &s;ometimes paid for on the &s;pot, and taken away by the purcha&s;er, or &s;ometimes the &s;eller contracts to remove it and erect it where it is to &s;tand; and, a dwelling may be purcha&s;ed, removed, rai&s;ed and inhabited, in the &s;pace of a week. The&s;e <HI>ready-made</HI> hou&s;es are ge|nerally collections of trunks of trees, tenanted and mortai&s;ed at each end, into one another, and nothing more is required, than the labour of tran&s;porting and erecting them. Wooden &s;tructures of very large dimen&s;ions and hand&s;ome appearance, are occa&s;io|nally formed in Ru&s;&s;ia, with an expedition almo&s;t inconceivable to the inhabitants of other countries: a remarkable in&s;tance of this di&s;patch was di&s;played the la&s;t time the Empre&s;s came to Mo&s;cow. Her Maje&s;ty propo&s;ed to re&s;ide in the man&s;ion of Prince Galatzin, which is e&s;teemed the complete&s;t edifice in the city, but as it was not &s;ufficiently &s;pacious for
<PB N="19" REF="21">
her reception, a temporary addition of wood, larger than the whole hou&s;e, and containing a magnificent &s;uite of apartments, was begun and fini&s;hed within the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks. This meteor-like fabrick was &s;o hand&s;ome and commodious, that the materials, which were taken down at her Maje&s;ty's departure, were ordered to be re-con&s;tructed as a kind of impe|rial villa, upon an eminence near the city.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At the entrance of each &s;treet in Mo&s;cow, is a <HI>chevaux-de-frize</HI> gate, one end of which turns upon a pivot, and the other rolls upon a wheel; near it is a centry-box, in which a man is occa&s;ionally &s;tatio|ned; and, in times of riot or a fire, the centinel &s;huts the gate, all pa&s;&s;age is immediately &s;topped, and any mob or concour&s;e of people prevented.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Among the public in&s;titutions of this city, the mo&s;t remarkable is, the Foundling Ho&s;pital, endow|ed in 1764, by the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s, and &s;upported by voluntary contributions. It is an immen&s;e pile of building, of a quadrangular form, and capable of receiving 8,000 children. Every child, that is brought, is admitted, the rooms are large and lofty, each infant has a &s;eparate bed, the bed&s;teads are iron, the &s;heets are changed weekly, and the linen three times a week. No cradles are allowed, no &s;waddling, but the children are all loo&s;ely dre&s;&s;ed. The director of this ho&s;pital is &s;o beloved and ca|re&s;&s;ed
<PB N="20" REF="22">
by the children, that, whenever he enters a room, they croud round him, and are as emulous of &s;hewing their fondne&s;s, as if he was their parent. They are divided into cla&s;&s;es, according to their ages; after remaining two years in the nur&s;ery, they are admitted, boys and girls together, into the lowe&s;t cla&s;s, where they continue five years. The boys are taught to knit, card hemp, flax and wool, and work in dif|ferent manufactures. The girls learn to knit, net, and do all kinds of needle-work, &s;pin and weave lace, and are employed in cookery, baking, and hou&s;e|work of all &s;orts. Both boys and girls learn to read, write, and ca&s;t accounts.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At fourteen, they may chu&s;e any branch of trade they like be&s;t, and for this purpo&s;e, there are differ|ent &s;pecies of manufactures e&s;tabli&s;hed in the ho&s;pi|tal, of which the chief is embroidery, &s;ilk &s;tockings, ribbonds, lace, gloves, buttons, and cabinet-work. A &s;eparate room is appropriated to each trade. Some boys are in&s;tructed in French and German, and a few in the Latin tongue. Others learn mu&s;ic, drawing and dancing. About the age of twenty, the found|lings receive a &s;um of money, with &s;everal other ad|vantages, which enables them to follow their trade in any part of the empire, a very con&s;iderable pri|vilege in Ru&s;&s;ia, where the pea&s;ants are &s;laves and cannot leave their village, without the permi&s;&s;ion of their ma&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">
<Q>In the ho&s;pital there is a theatre, of which all the decorations are the work of the foundlings; they con&s;tructed the &s;tage, painted the &s;cenes, and made the dre&s;&s;es, and they perform plays in the Ru&s;&s;ian language. I was &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Cox,</HI> at the ea&s;e with which they trod the &s;tage, and was plea&s;ed with the gracefulne&s;s of their action. There were &s;ome agreeable voices in the opera. The orche&s;tra was filled with a band by no means contemptible, which con&s;i&s;ted entirely of foundlings, except the fir&s;t vio|lin, who was their mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter. They perform al&s;o ballets, and dance with great ta&s;te and elegance. The Empre&s;s countenances this &s;eminary of theatri|cal repre&s;entation, from a de&s;ire of diffu&s;ing among her &s;ubjects that &s;pecies of entertainment, which &s;he con&s;iders as a means of civilization, and of enriching the Ru&s;&s;ian theatres with a con&s;tant &s;upply of per|formers.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Kapawna.</HI> From Mo&s;cow I pur&s;ued my way to Wolodimir, through Kapawna, a village about 23 Eng|li&s;h miles from Mo&s;cow. This is a place much cele|brated for it's nanufactures, and here are &s;everal gun-powder mills, belonging to private per&s;ons. The country is covered with pine-trees, and the &s;oil is every where full of flints, bearing evident traces of petri|factions.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24">Wolodimir is a city &s;ituated on &s;ome highlands along the northern banks of the river Klja&s;chma, and though not very populous or well-built, yet on account of it's delightful and advantageous &s;ituation, it's having 24 pari&s;hes, being partly built with free-&s;tone, and partly with wood, and the hou&s;es encompa&s;&s;ed with gar|dens, it makes a good appearance and affords a noble view. Near this city are &s;till to be &s;een the ruins of the ancient town, which extended it&s;elf near &s;even miles from the pre&s;ent boundaries. Whil&s;t we were here it was fruit-&s;ea&s;on, and we had no re&s;t day or night, ow|ing to tho&s;e who watch the cherry-orchards. In the middle of each, they erect a &s;caffold, from which they &s;train lines to every corner of the orchard. On each of the&s;e lines is fa&s;tened a rattling hammer, which if the line is in the lea&s;t moved, gives a &s;trong alarm. During the ripening of the fruit, men are appointed to watch the&s;e orchards, who frighten the birds by &s;trik|ing the&s;e rattles, and keep off interlopers, by flinging at them. They have in general but two kinds of cher|ry, except in the bi&s;hop's garden, where are grafted &s;ome others and which &s;eem to thrive. A large quan|tity of this fruit, vegetables, and cucumbers for pick|ling, are conveyed to Mo&s;cow, about 84 miles di&s;|tant. In the country round Wolodimir, are many no|ble man&s;ions, the &s;eats of the nobility, though the lands con&s;i&s;t in general of dry, &s;andy heaths. In this neighbourhood are &s;ome hills of lime-&s;tone, which they dig and carry to Twer and Mo&s;cow to be burnt. The
<PB N="23" REF="25">
countryman fancies, that if he covers his cart-load of burnt lime but thinly with a&s;p-leaves, that the harde&s;t and mo&s;t violent rain cannot injure it.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 28, <HI>Mugina.</HI> From Wolodimir, on July 28, we made the be&s;t of our way to Ka&s;imof; through Mu|gina, Wjo&s;chki, and Con&s;tantinowo. Beyond Mugina the country is woody, with a mar&s;hy &s;oil, &s;o woody, that there is &s;carce any open land to be &s;een, and the villagers are obliged to clear it away near their habita|tions, in order to procure ground for nece&s;&s;ary tillage, which they do, by firing the&s;e woods, regardle&s;s of the con&s;equence, whether it burns to the di&s;tance of half a mile &s;quare, or ten miles. So that we &s;ee &s;tanding a number of burnt trunks of trees, which they are too indolent to grub up. There are however many noble|men's &s;eats in this vicinage, but they bear the appear|ance of a lazy and fore&s;t economy. The timber in the&s;e fore&s;ts is chiefly fir and birch, &s;ome pines, and underwood of various kinds. The highways, on ac|count of their mar&s;hine&s;s are, all along, laid with the bodies of young firs, which make the roads very rough, and di&s;agreeable. Not far from Wjo&s;chki are two gla&s;s-hou&s;es, which are at no lo&s;s for fire.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;tantinowo.</HI> The inhabitants of Con&s;tantinowo are mo&s;tly potters, and carry their wares to all the adja|cent towns; for the land, round the villages in this neighbourhood, is chiefly potter's earth.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="26"><HI>Ka&s;imof, about</HI> 130 <HI>miles from Mo&s;cow.</HI> Ka&s;imof is a mean-built town, and the lands annexed to it belong to the regency of Worone&s;h. Notwith&s;tanding an ex|cellent free-&s;tone is found here, fit for building, the inhabitants make no u&s;e of it, for the whole town is built, in the Ru&s;&s;ian mode, with timber; and what is mo&s;t ridiculous, they lay their &s;treets and highways with boards and timber al&s;o, and the few churches and large buildings which are erected with &s;tone, are built with &s;uch mortar as came fir&s;t to hand.</P>
<P>In former times, when Ka&s;imof belonged to Tarta|rian princes, they were not &s;o inattentive to the nature of their &s;tone, for we &s;till &s;ee &s;ome hand&s;ome remains of their buildings worth pre&s;erving for the admira|tion of po&s;terity. In this Tartarian colony, (for the de&s;cendants of the ancient, Tartar inhabitants are &s;till re&s;ident in this town and it's neighbourhood, who are, for the mo&s;t part, affluent fur-merchants,) we &s;ee on an elevated &s;pot, a high &s;trong round-built tower or Mi&s;gir, of a ruined temple, which they are now re|building by the Empre&s;s's order. This ancient place of wor&s;hip is compo&s;ed of bricks, 13 inches long, and it's tower of &s;mooth-hewn free-&s;tone, &s;eemingly taken out of a quarry at eight miles di&s;tance. The other Tartarian remains are &s;ituated in an enclo&s;ure and &s;ome gardens ju&s;t by the tower, and are compo&s;ed of the &s;ame kind of free-&s;tone.

prince, and there &s;tood till lately &s;ome great buildings and a triumphal arch, with Gothic orna|ments and Arabian in&s;criptions, al&s;o an oblong, &s;quare-built man&s;ion, and a mau&s;oleum not far from the com|mon burial ground. This triumphal arch was for &s;ome unknown rea&s;ons demoli&s;hed by the pre&s;ent proprietor, and converted into a lime-kiln, &s;o that I could &s;ee only it's rubbi&s;h, and &s;ome few of it's ornaments. The prince's palace has al&s;o been pulled down, and nothing remains of it, but it's ba&s;e or foundation, five feet in height, which is converted into a wooden dwel|ling-hou&s;e. This man&s;ion or palace was from North to South, about 75 Engli&s;h feet in length, and about 22 feet wide. Under this building is a cave &s;trong vaulted, running under the whole.</P>
<P>South-ea&s;t of this man&s;ion &s;tands the mau&s;oleum of the Khans, which the proprietor, though in his garden, has &s;pared from de&s;truction. It has not the lea&s;t go|thic appearance, but is a &s;trong, oblong, &s;quare-&s;ided building, compo&s;ed of &s;mooth-hewn free-&s;tone. It has, round it's top, a plain cornice. The plate re|pre&s;ents a &s;outh view of it. The we&s;tern end contains a &s;mall vault or clo&s;et, de&s;igned as I apprehend, for private prayer, according to the Mahommedan cu&s;|tom. On the we&s;t &s;ide is a &s;mall entrance, paved with rough unhewn &s;tones, and on the north &s;ide a &s;mall window to let in the air. The other part of the mau|&s;oleum has a vault, in which are tomb-&s;tones. The&s;e
<PB N="26" REF="29">
vaults are covered with earth within the walls, on which grow &s;ome elder-trees. The length of the whole building from ea&s;t to we&s;t is above 47 Engli&s;h feet, the breadth from north to &s;outh about 26 feet, and it's height about 16 feet.</P>
<P>The little vault on the in&s;ide is not much above thirteen feet broad, from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The entrance to the great vault is on the &s;outhern &s;ide, almo&s;t in the middle of the building, clo&s;e to the partition be|tween the two vaults. It is a &s;mall door, not quite three feet and a half wide on the out&s;ide, increa&s;ing to near four feet and a half within, but without any ap|pearance of hinges. On this door is a table or &s;lab of marble, with the following in&s;cription in Arabic.</P>
<Q><P>TO THE SOLE GREAT GOD!</P>
<P>THE PRINCE OF THIS PLACE, SCHAGALI-KAN, SON OF SULTAN SCHICH AULEAR.</P>

<P><HI>Viz.</HI> Of the Hegyra, this is, if I mi&s;take not, ac|cording to our calculation, in the year 1520. The great vault is about twenty-one feet wide, about &s;even|teen broad, and twelve feet high. The northern wall has two windows or openings, and the ea&s;tern wall but
<PB N="27" REF="30">
one, which are like the door, narrower towards the out&s;ide, and were formerly cro&s;&s;ed with iron-bars, which &s;ome one has thought proper to remove. On the ground, within the walls, are eight di&s;tingui&s;hable grave-hills, about &s;even feet long, covered with &s;tones. One of the&s;e is almo&s;t &s;quare, whereby it appears, that two bodies have been there interred. Indeed with|in the vaults over which the&s;e <HI>tumuli</HI> or hillocks are rai&s;ed, there are nine &s;kulls to be &s;een. At the head or we&s;t end of each grave-hill was erected a tomb-&s;tone five or &s;ix feet high, the top of the&s;e &s;tones &s;haped off in an obtu&s;e angle. There is now but two of the&s;e &s;tones &s;tanding, the others are broken to pieces and &s;cattered about. The&s;e &s;tones on one &s;ide were orna|mented with flowers and &s;tars, on the other was an Ara|bian in&s;cription, neatly fini&s;hed and divided into &s;pa|ces. Underneath the&s;e vaults is a &s;ubterranean &s;epul|chral cave, of the &s;ame length with the vaults, but not &s;o wide, the entrance into which is a narrow open|ing, formerly &s;tuffed up with earth and &s;tones. In this low &s;epulchral cave dead bodies have been laid on a wooden &s;caffold, but modern curio&s;ity having trou|bled their re&s;t, nothing now is there to be &s;een, but &s;cattered &s;kulls, rib-bones, hair, and &s;ome yellow, green, and brown &s;triped taffaty, which has pre&s;erved it's texture and colour, tolerably well.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of this town they gather the Birthwort, a plant renowned as a family-medicine
<PB N="28" REF="31">
among the Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ants. It is reported, that this plant boiled is an infallible cure for all pains in the limbs, and that it's fruit, which re&s;embles a fig, if eaten raw, cures all relap&s;es of fevers.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 3. I left this place for Murom the 3d of Augu&s;t, and travelled all along the banks of the Oka, where are a number of luxuriant meadows. The Ru&s;&s;ian countrywomen here, wear a particular head-dre&s;s which I &s;aw not in any other place. This is a flat, &s;tiff cap, the top of which forms a pair of horns, and round which, according to their fa&s;hion, they wind a piece of cloth which hangs down behind.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 4, 5. On the 4th and 5th we pa&s;&s;ed many lord&s;hips, for the nearer we approached Murom, the more villages we &s;aw on both &s;ides. Ju&s;t before we enter Murom, is a chapel, built with wood, and dedi|cated to <HI>St. Elias,</HI> near which is a &s;mall hou&s;e of pray|er, and an enclo&s;ed well, which this holy man is &s;aid to have dug him&s;elf, and which the &s;uper&s;titious peo|ple believe is of great benefit to the head and eyes, if they wa&s;h them&s;elves with it's water devoutly.</P>
<P><HI>Murom, about</HI> 54 <HI>miles from Ka&s;imof.</HI> Murom, like the town of Ka&s;imof, is built clo&s;e to the river Oka, and &s;uffers much by the rapidity of it's waters, which wa&s;h away the bank on which the town &s;tands, and occa&s;ions many of the buildings to fall in. The old
<PB N="29" REF="32">
inhabitants remember that the hou&s;es &s;tood formerly as far out as the middle of the river, and that a church, among other buildings was once carried away by the &s;tream. It even now undermines &s;ome hou&s;e or other annually; and, &s;ome at pre&s;ent &s;tand &s;o near upon the brink of the &s;hore, that it is ra&s;hne&s;s to inhabit them. Here are al&s;o &s;ome public buildings, two churches, and a convent, which &s;eem hourly to wait their fall, and would have been in the water, e're now, had they not been &s;upported with large &s;tones placed beneath them. Were willow-trees planted again&s;t the bank, the earth would &s;tand firm again&s;t the waters, and the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters might be prevented.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this town are more indu&s;trious in the cultivation of their gardens, than the people ge|nerally are in little Ru&s;&s;ian towns; for, they not only rai&s;e culinary herbs of mo&s;t kinds, but al&s;o melons and fruits. Some hou&s;es have good apple-orchards annexed.</P>
<P>It may not be di&s;agreeable to &s;ome readers to know, that in this vicinage grows the Spurge, called by Linnaeus, <HI>Euphorbia palu&s;tris,</HI> which the people u&s;e as an emetic, and if the leaves want efficacy, they take an extract of it's root, made with hot-water. This excites but little vomiting, and that at one ca&s;t, nor does it gripe. They a&s;&s;ured me it was a good remedy

in ob&s;tinate relap&s;es of fevers and internal durities. The do&s;e, five Ru&s;&s;ian <HI>Solotniks</HI> in weight.</P>
<P>The river Oka running here through limy, loamy and &s;andy &s;hores, will not be &s;uppo&s;ed to carry any precious metals; but, the fact is, that there are peo|ple in Murom, that employ them&s;elves during the &s;ummer, in wa&s;hing the &s;and near the town, and are richly repaid in what they find. This is &s;mall grains of gold, &s;ilver and copper, and &s;ome pretty &s;mall &s;tones. I have often &s;een them at work; they dig the &s;and with a &s;pade, and wa&s;h it in troughs. Such grains as they find, they put into a quill, &s;top it up and hang it round their necks. In the&s;e wa&s;hings I have met with &s;mall topazes, cornelians, and agates. The&s;e certainly mu&s;t have been wa&s;hed down the river from the demolition of old tombs, or other accidental circum&s;tances. Perhaps tho&s;e grains of gold and &s;il|ver which they find, have the &s;ame origin.</P>
<P><HI>Motmo&s;s.</HI> Not far from this river, at a village called Motmo&s;s, about twenty-two miles from Murom, we met for the fir&s;t time in Ru&s;&s;ia, people afflicted with wens, and though the village is &s;mall, there are many, particularly children and young folks, labouring in the highe&s;t degree under this di&s;order. They &s;ay this evil is not le&s;s common in other neighbouring villages, and as the brook-waters u&s;ed here, are of a martial or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">halybeate nature, and carry many marly particles,
<PB N="31" REF="34">
the hitherto-unknown origin of this malady might perhaps be found out, if tho&s;e waters, where the di&s;or|der is common, could be di&s;covered of a &s;imilar qua|lity.</P>
<P>Here is a great deal of iron-&s;tone dug in this neigh|bourhood, one hundred weight of which will yield 30lb. of neat iron. The method of preparing it for the melting-hou&s;e is, to burn it fir&s;t, which they do on &s;tacks of pine-trunks. There are iron-mills not far off, where they ca&s;t and forge iron.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 15. On the 15th of Augu&s;t, we left Murom, in our way to Ar&s;amas, and in a village about twenty-four miles from it, I took notice of the u&s;e the coun|try people made of the Siberian Centaury. Having pick|ed only the broade&s;t leaves, they dry them, beat them to powder in a fine woolen cloth, and u&s;e that powder as a &s;tiptic to &s;top the bleeding of wounds. It &s;oon clo&s;es the wound and heals it.</P>
<P><HI>Fore&s;t of Muran.</HI> In the fore&s;t of Muran, great plenty of mu&s;hrooms are found, which the country-folks gather for food, and lay up for the winter. The&s;e, with bread, is the chief &s;upport of the poor. Such as they lay up for the winter, they &s;alt and dry. Every kind of mu&s;hroom is here eaten, except the fly mu&s;h|room, and that which grows in dung. They either eat them raw with &s;alt, boil them in oil, or roa&s;t them;
<PB N="32" REF="35">
but, the mo&s;t remarkable mu&s;hroom, is that which they call <HI>O&s;inowik,</HI> which implies, growing in a&s;h-wood. As &s;oon as it is gathered and laid in the air, or as &s;oon as it's &s;tem begins to ripen, the part underneath the head takes on a grea&s;y and blue colour; if broken in the middle, it's body &s;eems quite white, but after a few &s;econds turns blui&s;h in the air, and in the end changes into a mo&s;t beautiful ultramarine. Break it as often as you will, the broken parts will have the &s;ame appear|ance, and if it's watery juice is pre&s;&s;ed out, it's drops, in falling, have a blui&s;h ca&s;t, but momentaneou&s;ly change, in an open ve&s;&s;el, into the above-mentioned beautiful color, which will dye linen the &s;ame. It is a pity however, that at the moment of it's highe&s;t per|fection, it &s;hould grow gradually pale. Linen dyed with it, and even the juice will go through every &s;hade into a colour, called Saxon green, and in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, will change into a blui&s;h green; which grows paler &s;till, and cannot be pre&s;erved by any of the u&s;ual means. If dipped in water, it grows pale &s;ooner, and almo&s;t lo&s;es it's whole colour when dying.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 19. <HI>Ar&s;amas, about</HI> 90 <HI>miles from Murom.</HI> On the 19th, we reached Ar&s;amas, about ninety miles from Murom. This town &s;tands on an eminence, has &s;ome trade, and it's inhabitants live more by commerce than by hu&s;bandry, except in the article of onions, of which they tran&s;port a great quantity into the ea&s;tern parts of the empire.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36">However filthy and ill-built the town of Ar&s;amas is, on account of the various trades and bu&s;ine&s;s car|ried on in it, it is more than ordinary plentiful, populous and wealthy, which &s;hews how far a little trade and a few manufactures will enrich a &s;tate. The whole town, a few public offices and &s;hop-keepers excepted, con|&s;i&s;ts of &s;oap-boilers, tanners, blue-dyers, and &s;hoe|makers. The latter work out, and tran&s;port a great deal of leather, here prepared.</P>
<P>Little but the common &s;ort of leather is tanned in Ar&s;amas, except indeed a few Ru&s;&s;ia hides, which are not in the greate&s;t e&s;timation. They tan with the bark of <HI>Salix Arenaria,</HI> a &s;pecies of willow, and render the &s;kins &s;mooth, with the pure&s;t and thinne&s;t birch-oil, which they convey here by the river Kama. They have no mills to grind their tan, but reduce it to pow|der by beating it with heavy &s;harp-edged hammers, as they generally do throughout all Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The &s;oap here made is white, and but of one &s;ort. They make their lye of common wood-a&s;hes only. The &s;oap is boiled in iron furnaces &s;o large, as to con|tain from four tons weight Engli&s;h of grea&s;e to &s;even tons, and they put ten pounds of &s;alt to 100 lbs. of grea&s;e. The grea&s;e is then boiled often upon the lye, which they frequently change, for ten or twelve days, till the &s;urface &s;hews that the &s;oap is completed. The furnace then is &s;uffered to cool for twelve days more,
<PB N="34" REF="37">
and the &s;oap is dug out with iron &s;pades. Of a quan|tity of grea&s;e, they generally draw four-fifths of it in &s;oap. Of the &s;cum-&s;oap, they make a &s;ud, and if the grea&s;e be good, it yields pound for pound.</P>
<P>The dyers in this town dye only that blue linen &s;o fa&s;hionable among the Ru&s;&s;ian women, except a lit|tle narrow cotton, which is here made. Their method of dying is merely boiling the linen in water, in which they put very little indigo and woad, with &s;ome wood-a&s;hes, &s;moothing the cloth afterwards by pre&s;&s;ing it, then watering it, and &s;tretching it abroad till it is dry. Before they dye the linen, they beat it, that it may not take too much colour. Some women dye their cloths red them&s;elves, with a wild red they gather in the fields and al&s;o green, in a dye formed from birch-twigs and allum. The yellow chamomile, <HI>(Anthemis tinctoria,)</HI> yields an excellent yellow colour, either for dying or painting.</P>
<P>As the &s;treets of this town are narrow and very mud|dy, and all the&s;e na&s;ty trades are there carried on, the reader may naturally judge of the impurity of it's air. And though the inhabitants have no wells, nor any water to drink but what they take from a &s;mall brook that runs through the town, they throw into this brook without he&s;itation all the filth they make.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="38">Be&s;ides the&s;e manufactures, they were e&s;tabli&s;hing one for pot-a&s;hes, upon a new plan.</P>
<P>In all the low lands about Ar&s;amas, grows the Hel|lebore <HI>(Veratrum Album,)</HI> well known to the pea&s;ants throughout Ru&s;&s;ia, on account of it's noxious quality, for which rea&s;on they pick it out from the gra&s;s when cut. But as this is the time of it's &s;eeds ripening, the plant &s;hould be rooted out, or the &s;eeds burnt, to pre|vent the evil increa&s;ing. Young and unexperienced lambs will frequently eat it in &s;pring, and occa&s;ion their death; and, &s;ome hungry hor&s;es, if it be left in the hay, will al&s;o eat it; when it occa&s;ions griping and foaming at the mouth. Should it chance to fall into a yard where poultry is kept, it is &s;ure to kill them. Notwith&s;tanding the plant has this deadly quality, the pea&s;ants u&s;e it for a &s;alutary purpo&s;e. They dry the root, powder it, and &s;pread this powder over tho&s;e biles, which certain maggots, in this country called <HI>Oe&s;tri,</HI> cau&s;e in the &s;kin. Nay, they &s;ometimes take the root fre&s;h internally, to expell worms.</P>
<P><HI>Lopatina, about</HI> 16 <HI>miles from Ar&s;amas.</HI> Upon an eminence oppo&s;ite Lopatina, about 16 miles from Ar|&s;amas, are &s;ome ve&s;tiges of an old intrenchment, which appear to have been thrown up in the early wars car|ried on in this country, again&s;t the Mordvines.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="39"><HI>Kawara.</HI> In the village Kawara, lying ea&s;t of Lo|patina, is an aby&s;s to be &s;een, which &s;wallowed up a farm and it's inhabitants, owing to &s;ome &s;ubterraneous waters, which in their cour&s;e undermined the ground. There was lately al&s;o a &s;imilar &s;inking of the earth, which is now the channel of a flowing water. And there are probably here &s;ome &s;ubterranean waters, as it is well known of a lake in this neighbourhood crowd|ed with fi&s;h, than when they are aware of the net, they retire to an aby&s;s, the depth of which has not yet been fathomed.</P>
<P>The&s;e Mordvines inhabit the right &s;hore of Pjana, dwell in &s;ome &s;cattered and &s;eque&s;tered cottages, and have pre&s;erved but few of their ancient cu&s;toms, owing to their being, for the mo&s;t part, converted to chri&s;tia|nity. They &s;peak however a language of their own, and have &s;ome peculiarities of dre&s;s, among the wo|men. In other re&s;pects, they are like the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P><Q>The Mordvines are of Finni&s;h origin, were of two tribes," &s;ays Mr. <HI>Tooke,</HI> 'and were a long time in &s;ubjection to the Tartars, but even then had their peculiar Khans. They compo&s;e a very con&s;iderable nation, and at every numeration of them, they have been found to increa&s;e in the &s;ame proportion as the Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ants. Formerly, they had a nobility among them, but tho&s;e familes have been a long while extinct. Before the introduction of chri&s;tiani|ty,
<PB N="37" REF="40">
a Mordvine was not permitted to marry out of his own tribe, but at pre&s;ent this is not regarded, and they &s;ettle in this or that tribe as they plea&s;e, pre&s;erving always &s;ome principal characteri&s;tic, &s;e|veral particularities of dre&s;s, and many di&s;tinctive cu&s;toms.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e people re&s;emble more the Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ants, than either the T&s;cheremi&s;&s;es or the T&s;chouwa&s;ches, (of whom we &s;hall &s;peak by-and-by,) 'and conform more to their way of living. The Mordvines have com|monly brown har&s;h hair, a thin beard, and lean face; it is very rare to find a pretty woman among them. They are hone&s;t, laborious and ho&s;pitable, but &s;low, and imitate the Ru&s;&s;ians and Tartars in &s;everal things. There are not many unbaptized among them, but the&s;e eat pork without any &s;cruple, whil&s;t all the heathen T&s;chouwa&s;ches, and all the people of A&s;iatic Ru&s;&s;ia abhor and ab&s;tain from it, as the fle&s;h of the impure&s;t of animals.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Since their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Ru&s;&s;ia, they pur&s;ue a life of agriculture, and are not fond of towns, but always form them&s;elves into little villages, and that in and about fore&s;ts. Their villages, hou&s;es, farms, agri|culture and their little flocks, their goods, their food, and their whole economy, differ in nothing from the T&s;chouwa&s;ches and T&s;cheremi&s;&s;es. In like manner the Mordvines have a little enclo&s;ure near their
<PB N="38" REF="41">
hou&s;es, wherein they plant roots and herbs for the kitchen. They are not &s;o fond of hunting as their neighbours. The Mordvine women are employed in the &s;ame works as the T&s;cheremi&s;&s;ian, and have neither le&s;s dexterity nor application; the &s;tate of their families, their riches and their taxes, are al&s;o the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The dre&s;s of the men is that of a Ru&s;&s;ian pea|&s;ant, except their &s;hirts, which they pink and em|broider about the neck and openings.</Q></P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the married Mordvine women con&s;i&s;ts, of a high-&s;tuffed cap, &s;ewed with various coloured thread, with a &s;lap hanging down behind, to which are tied &s;everal little chains and jingling toys; linen &s;hifts and petticoats, which they ornament with red and blue dyed needlework, according to their ta&s;te and fancy. They wear al&s;o a girdle, from which hangs down be|hind a kind of apron, embroidered with wor&s;ted of various colours, and bordered with fringe, ta&s;&s;els, co|rals and other rattling and jingling &s;tuff. Round about the girdle, be&s;ides the above, they wear &s;everal other party-coloured fringed pieces. Tho&s;e who have &s;uch ornamented girdles, have their &s;hifts more elegantly &s;titched, and wear a wide, linen, upper-gown, with &s;hort &s;leeves, half-an-ell wide. The&s;e upper-gowns are &s;ometimes died yellow. Their upper-&s;hift, (for they generally wear two,) is fa&s;tened round the throat, with
<PB N="39" REF="42">
a &s;mall pin, and upon their bo&s;om with a large one, from which hangs &s;uch heavy collections of corals, copper-buttons, &s;mall little chains, medals, coins, lit|tle bells, and other jingling things of the like kind, that the Mordvine dre&s;s is not le&s;s heavy than a hor&s;e's harne&s;s. Ear-rings belong to the every days dre&s;s, but, on particular occa&s;ions, they wear bracelets, wound thrice round the wri&s;t, and exactly &s;imilar to tho&s;e worn in India.</P>
<P>The girls' dre&s;s has le&s;s of the&s;e jingles, but in other re&s;pects it is the &s;ame, except that they wear no cap, but braid their hair into a tail, agreeable to the Ru&s;|&s;ian fa&s;hion, to which are tied &s;ome knots of fringes and ribbands. The old fa&s;hion was to braid the hair in eight or nine &s;mall tre&s;&s;es, tho&s;e behind each ear ra|ther larger than the re&s;t, having in both a &s;quare buc|kle, to which hang medals and other clattering toys. But all the tre&s;&s;es were lengthened underneath with woollen &s;trings, and pa&s;&s;ed through the girdle. I af|terwards took notice, that even the married Mord|vine women, near the Wolga, had their hair in a &s;imi|lar way, braided into a large tail with black &s;heep's wool, &s;o as to reach down to the knees.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="43">Although the Mordvine women, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Er&s;anian origin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The difference between this tribe and the Mordvines, will be ex|plained hereafter.</NOTE>, who&s;e dre&s;s I have here de&s;cribed, are almo&s;t the filthie&s;t of all nations throughout the whole Ru&s;&s;ian empire; yet, the men de&s;erve the prai&s;e of being indu&s;trious farmers, and &s;urpa&s;s their coun|trymen in this particular. They breed as many bees as they can, "and will have" &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>
<Q>from 100 to 200 hives.</Q>
Tho&s;e that live about the woods are hardy and expert hunt&s;men, and turn every thing in their way to advantage.</P>
<P><Q>Some of their cu&s;toms according to Mr. <HI>Tooke,</HI> are as follow. Their marriages are tran&s;acted by nego|tiation, and they bargain for their wives as do the T&s;cheremi&s;&s;es. The <HI>Kalym</HI> or price of the bride is commonly between eight and ten rubles, each ruble about four &s;hillings &s;terling; a proof that this nati|on is not over rich. The time for the celebration of the nuptials being come, the father of the young man goes to fetch the bride, who&s;e father conducts her by the hand, and delivers her to the former. Her mother on this occa&s;ion, pre&s;ents a little bread and &s;alt to the father-in-law of her daughter; and then the maid takes leave of her parents, which is always accompanied with tears; her father-in-law leading her away covered with a veil. On her arrival at the bridegroom's, they all &s;it down to table; the
<PB N="41" REF="44">
young man pulls his cap over his eyes, and places him&s;elf by her &s;ide. A cake of three feet in length is placed on the table, which the father of the bride|groom takes, and pre&s;ents the pointed extremity of it under the bride's veil, &s;aying, <HI>Open thine eyes to the light; be thou happy in thy children, and never de&s;|titute of bread!</HI> Immediately after this, the bride|groom &s;ees his beloved for the fir&s;t time, whom his father had bought for him, without con&s;ulting him. This done, they begin to eat and divert them&s;elves by dances, &s;ongs and &s;ports, to the &s;ound of a pipe, but always with the mug in their hands. When the young couple prepare for bed, the bride makes a great deal of re&s;i&s;tance, in&s;omuch that the a&s;&s;i&s;tants, force her to &s;it down on a mat, and then taking up the corners, carry her upon it into the bed-chamber. Parents very frequently promi&s;e their children, while yet in their infancy, and as a &s;ign of the engagement, interchange the pointed ends of horns, which &s;erve them for &s;nuff-boxes. The young woman, however, is not bound by this compact, but if the lad is in|clined to marry el&s;ewhere, he is obliged to pay a certain number of rubles by way of fine. It is law|ful among them, to have &s;everal wives at once, but they &s;eldom u&s;e this privilege.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A widower always choo&s;es to marry his &s;i&s;ter-in law when he can. If the parents will not con&s;ent to this, he tries to &s;lide into her hand under the table,
<PB N="42" REF="45">
a little loaf, without being perceived, pronouncing at the &s;ame time, <HI>My &s;i&s;ter-in-law &s;hall be kept for me.</HI> On &s;aying this, he mu&s;t run out of the hou&s;e as fa&s;t as he can, for if he is caught, he is immedi|ately regaled with a &s;hower of blows, as hard and as thick as they can be laid on him; but, if he has addre&s;s enough to e&s;cape them, the fair-one belongs to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Among the chri&s;tian Mordvines, the brides like|wi&s;e cover them&s;elves with a veil during the marri|age ceremony. Great care is taken that they do not meet a man in their way to church, it being looked upon as an unhappy omen.</Q></P>
<P>The dead are interred in their be&s;t cloths; the com|pany
<Q>eat cakes and drink beer about the grave, and place a portion of each upon it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The greate&s;t part of the Mordvines are now chri&s;ti|ans, but tho&s;e who are Pagans, call their &s;upreme being by the name of <HI>Pas,</HI> the Mok&s;canes call him <HI>Skie,</HI> which &s;ignifys the &s;ky. They have a mother of the gods and a &s;on of god whom they call <HI>Inil|&s;chi Pas.</HI> Their <HI>Ma&s;ter Pas,</HI> is a &s;ubterranean divi|nity, not very beneficent. The <HI>Nikolai Pas</HI> is the St. Nicolas of the Ru&s;&s;ians, whom they hold in great veneration. The Mordvines attribute to him the pro&s;perity of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire, for which rea&s;on
<PB N="43" REF="46">
they light up candles to him in the Ru&s;&s;ian churches, and in their hou&s;es hold his image in great re&s;pect. They have no image, and their adorations, &s;acrifices and fe&s;tivals in general, are the &s;ame with the reli|gious ceremonies of the T&s;cheremi&s;&s;es and the T&s;chouwa&s;ches. Though the Pagan Mordvines have no knowledge of the religion of the Ru&s;&s;ians, they &s;uppo&s;e them to have peculiar divinities, and to ob|tain their favour, they &s;acrifice game, and make ob|lations of cakes and liquors every Chri&s;tmas and Ea&s;|ter-day. Whenever they hear thunder they exclaim, <HI>Pa&s;changui Pourguini Pas,</HI> that is, <HI>Have mercy on us O God Pourguini!</HI> But they make no offering of any kind to this deity. Their prayers are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the people we have &s;o oftened mentio|ned. The countenance they put on when they pray, the manner of lying with their faces on the earth, and &s;everal of their other cu&s;toms &s;eem borrowed from the Tartars.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 28. On the 28th of Augu&s;t, I left the Pjana and pur&s;ued my way to Saran&s;k. This di&s;trict is re|markable for that rich black &s;oil &s;o common to the Sura, Wolga, and other rivers, which flow from the ea&s;t into the Wolga. In all the&s;e parts, the happy hu&s;|bandman has no occa&s;ion to manure his grounds, and commonly fallows his land but every third crop. Here are &s;pots where the &s;oil never fails, but, where, if it dimini&s;hes in richne&s;s, there is plenty of ground
<PB N="44" REF="47">
in the le&s;s inhabited parts, plenty of lay land, which if turned up, produces the fine&s;t arable imaginable. Was this rich ground to be manured, the corn would be too luxuriant and fall. With all the&s;e advantages, it is to be lamented, that they &s;ow neither hemp, flax, or corn, more than they have occa&s;ion for their u&s;e; but, only provide for them&s;elves and the next market. The people here are al&s;o very reprehen&s;ible for heap|ing up their dung as they do, on hills, the produce of their numerous herds, as &s;uch enormous dung-hills be|get mon&s;trous &s;warms of flies, which are very trou|ble&s;ome.</P>
<P><HI>Arath, about</HI> 35 <HI>miles from Ar&s;amas.</HI> In the town of Arath re&s;ide many potters. The&s;e burn their ve&s;&s;els in a large pot full of holes, re&s;embling a tub, &s;et in the ground, which the Ru&s;&s;ians u&s;e by way of oven, and when the ve&s;&s;el is red-hot, quench it in boiling water in which &s;ome flour has been thrown. They are of opinion this gives the pots a greater &s;olidity and hardne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Tol&s;koi Maidan, about</HI> 11 <HI>miles from Arath.</HI> As we travelled further on, we pa&s;&s;ed villages, particularly about Tol&s;koi, where their cattle were dying with a plague or contagious di&s;temper. It is evident, that the chief cau&s;e of this di&s;order is their moi&s;t pa&s;ture and the little care that is taken to keep the cattle dry and clean.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="48"><HI>Pot&s;hinki, about</HI> 20 <HI>miles from Tol&s;koi.</HI> At Pot&s;hinki are &s;ome fine meadows, where there is a breed of hor|&s;es, for the Imperial life-guards, to which this &s;tud belongs. The &s;tallions are mo&s;tly of Dani&s;h race, in order to get large hor&s;es. The number generally kept is 30, and about 720 mares. Pot&s;hinki is a pretty place, a borough town, has a garri&s;on, three churches, and &s;ome thou&s;and hou&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Saran&s;k, about</HI> 46 <HI>miles from Tol&s;koi, Sept.</HI> 1. On the 1&s;t day of September, we arrived at Saran&s;k, and though the farmers were here bu&s;y with their harve&s;t, we had a &s;trong fro&s;t. Saran&s;k is a &s;mall place, in the province of Pen&s;a and regency of Ca&s;an, and inhabi|ted by hu&s;bandmen, a few trade&s;men and merchants excepted. In Saran&s;k, as in all other little towns, in the innermo&s;t part of the empire, many of the female inhabitants are employed in dying woollen yarn, with the juice of &s;ome herbs growing in this country; and, as I wi&s;h to communicate any u&s;eful intelligence I could meet with; that &s;ome of my readers may profit by my enquiries, I was very inqui&s;itive into the nature of this dye. The principal ingredient is a kind of mo&s;s, which grows very copiou&s;ly in all the fenny woods of Ru&s;&s;ia, and is univer&s;ally known by the name of <HI>Seleniza,</HI> in Latin, <HI>Lycopodium complanatum.</HI> The country people gather it by handfuls, tie it in bunches, and carry it to market, where it is &s;old very cheap. This mo&s;s is fir&s;t reduced to powder, and then made
<PB N="46" REF="49">
into the con&s;i&s;tency of pap, and very &s;our with flour. The yarn to be dyed, remains one or more nights in this mixture, which gives it a yellowi&s;h ca&s;t, it is then wa&s;hed and dried, and is fit to receive any other co|lour. The common people, who know not the u&s;e of allum, have recour&s;e to this preparation, in almo&s;t all dyes; but, the Mordvines, the people of T&s;chuwa, and the Tartars, u&s;e either the common yellow phea|&s;ant's-eye <HI>(Adonis verna,)</HI> or the common wormwood, with a &s;mall quantity of &s;ingle-&s;eeded broom mixed, the <HI>Geni&s;ta tinctoria,</HI> but &s;ometimes, they u&s;e only the thi&s;tle, <HI>(Carduus heterophyllus,)</HI> with it's pretty, yellow-colouring leaves, called by the Er&s;ane race of Mord|vines, <HI>Pi&s;helaoma-tik&s;ched,</HI> (the green herb,) with which they boil the wool that has been dyed blue, with in|digo or woad, and give it a beautiful green.</P>
<P>The herbs commonly made u&s;e of here for dying, are the following.</P>
<P>For a light yellow, the yellow chamomile, <HI>(Anthemis tinctoria,)</HI> the &s;ingle-&s;eeded broom, the dyer's thi&s;tle, or melilot, <HI>(Serratula,)</HI> weeds growing generally throughout Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>For a fine yellow, the water-hemp agrimony, <HI>(Bidens tripartita.)</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="50">For a deep red, the roots of lady's bed-&s;traw, <HI>(Gal|lium molugo,)</HI> or the wood-ruffe, <HI>(aperula tinctoria,)</HI> which they call in Ru&s;s, <HI>Marjona.</HI></P>
<P>To attempt &s;carlet, they u&s;e the common marjo|ram, <HI>(Origanum.)</HI></P>
<P>For green, they dye blue wool, with the above-na|med yellow-dying herbs, or birch leaves. There are al&s;o &s;ome who po&s;&s;e&s;s the art of making a high green, by an addition of allum, the unblown ears of the reed <HI>(Arundo calamogro&s;tis,)</HI> and a yellow green, from the berries of their foul-tree, (in Ru&s;s, <HI>Kru&s;china.)</HI> The country women know where to gather all the&s;e, in their proper &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>For blue, they have no other colouring than the wild woad, which grows in little Ru&s;&s;ia, but they oc|ca&s;ionally purcha&s;e indigo, or logwood from the mer|chants, which they u&s;e in their own way.</P>
<P>In order to die yellow, with the &s;ingle-&s;eeded broom, it's powder is mixed with that pap-like preparation I have mentioned; but, the wool receives fir&s;t a yel|lowi&s;h tinge, by laying a week in that preparation, be|fore the broom is mixed with it. To brighten the co|lour, after the wool has been &s;oaked and dried, they wa&s;h it at different times in lye. The melilot is boil|ed in water, with the addition of a little allum, and
<PB N="48" REF="51">
the yarn, after having undergone the fir&s;t preparation, is wa&s;hed in this dye or liquor. They dye &s;ilk, and &s;ometimes wool, with the flower of the yellow cha|momile, and the African marigold <HI>(tagetes,)</HI> but with the&s;e ingredients, the allum is particularly nece&s;&s;ary. The water-hemp agrimony, affords a pretty high yel|low, if boiled with &s;ome allum, and this grows &s;till more flaming, by the addition of the root of lady's bed-&s;traw and wood-ruffe; and, the oftener the article is dipped in this dye, the brighter the colour. This wild red, (for &s;o I call the root of lady's bed-&s;traw and wood-ruffe,) is like mo&s;t plants u&s;ed here for dying, brui&s;ed in wooden mortars, and ground to powder with hand-mills. This is made into a pap-like con&s;i&s;tency with water, and placed in a warm oven for one night. Next day they add more water, and boil it, and to give brightne&s;s to the colour, boil &s;ome oak or birch-bark with it. Sometimes they add a&s;hes to it. And when the dye is deep enough, and luke-warm, they dip their wool two or three times in it, and once more, when the dye is boiling hot. If the colour plea|&s;es them, they next wa&s;h the yarn in the river, and dry it. But the colour is commonly brighte&s;t, when the dye con&s;i&s;ts of a mixture of water-hemp agrimony, the melilot, the &s;ingle-&s;eeded broom, and the thi&s;tle <HI>Car|duus heterophyllus,</HI> and the be&s;t tincture is made by that deep black-red powder, which, when the roots are gently beaten, comes off at fir&s;t, this being, properly &s;peaking, the genuine dying bark.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="52">The u&s;e of the marjoram <HI>(Origanum,)</HI> is different, and was thus de&s;cribed to me. The flowers and crowns of this plant were gathered whil&s;t in bloom, dried in an oven, and reduced to powder. In the &s;ame manner they powder the young &s;pring-leaves of the apple-tree. An equal quantity of each of the&s;e is taken, (though &s;ome will take two-fourths of melilot, one of apple-leaves, and one of boiled malt,) and well mixed with leaven, to make it ferment. As &s;oon as it is &s;our, it is &s;queezed out with the hands, and &s;et for a whole night in a warm oven, where it is frequently &s;tirred. Here it is dried; this done, it is boiled in clean water, and the dye is complete. Some go to work more &s;imply, by taking equal parts of the herbs and apple-leaves, and boil them with allum. But, with this pro|ce&s;s, the red will not be beautiful. The colour thus prepared, is very bright, and will not fade by wa&s;h|ing.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;&s;a,</HI> 27 <HI>miles from Saran&s;k, Sept.</HI> 5. On the 4th of September we quitted Saran&s;k, and reached I&s;&s;a, a vil|lage belonging to <HI>Count Woronzo,</HI> at the di&s;tance of about twenty-&s;even miles, pretty late in the evening. This place is al&s;o remarkable for it's breed of hor&s;es, and of cour&s;e, little grain is here &s;owed, but oats. Here is al&s;o a carpet manufactory, and another in an adjacent manor. The carpets here fabricated, are re|nowned for their beauty, and de&s;erve encouragement, was it only becau&s;e the wool, of which they are made, is
<PB N="50" REF="53">
taken from the backs of the &s;heep here bred; the works being carried on by children, over whom a &s;kil|ful country la&s;s pre&s;ides, and the wool being dyed, from plants growing in the neighbourhood. The only foreign colour they make u&s;e of, are the bra&s;il-wood, which dyes crim&s;on, if prepared with lye, the indigo for dying blue, and the log-wood for dying violet; but, the&s;e colours are not &s;o la&s;ting, as tho&s;e from the herbs I have mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;ara, about</HI> 24 <HI>miles from I&s;&s;a.</HI> About twenty-four miles from I&s;&s;a, in the high road to Pen&s;a, we found our&s;elves at the city of In&s;ara. This is an abject place, built by the people of Streliza, during the late reign of Peter the Great, who&s;e inhabitants, were neither active nor indu&s;trious. The town is &s;ituated on the banks of the river In&s;ara, which falls into the I&s;&s;a. At the upper end of the city, the re&s;iding <HI>Sawod&s;hik Nikonof,</HI> has e&s;tabli&s;hed an iron manufactory, built a good hou&s;e for him&s;elf, and erected a church with &s;tone, which are the be&s;t buildings in this place. The public offices and cathedral, are in the wooden fortre&s;s, and in poor condition, as is another church built with wood. The iron uten&s;ils made in this manufactory, are pots, boilers, and a kind of large &s;eething ve&s;&s;els, which is the chief furniture of a Tartar or Kalmuck's hou&s;e, and which produce a good price. They manu|facture annually, about twenty ton-weight of the&s;e
<PB N="51" REF="54">
articles, which they carry up the Wolga, to the mar|kets in little Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The iron-&s;tone that &s;upplys this manufactory, is about eight miles di&s;tance. There is al&s;o in this neigh|bourhood a manufactory for making pot-a&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 6. <HI>Schadin,</HI> 18 <HI>miles from In&s;a.</HI> On the 6th of September we left In&s;ar for Pen&s;a, and at night reached the Mordvine village Schadin, a di&s;tance of eighteen miles. The inhabitants of this place, are of a differ|ent origin from tho&s;e who are &s;ettled near the Pjana, in the regency of Ni&s;chegorod. They are careful to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the latter, and call them|&s;elves <HI>Mok&s;chanes,</HI> which expre&s;&s;es in their language, the whole race of Mordvines, and give the others, the name of <HI>Er&s;anes.</HI> In the&s;e di&s;tricts inhabited by the Mok&s;chanes, are very few villages of the other tribe, but both are occa&s;ionally met with in the &s;ame villages, and with little difference between them, all along the rivers Wolga, Sok and T&s;cherem&s;ham, and other neighbouring di&s;tricts belonging to the regencies of Ca&s;an and Orenburg, where they were &s;ent with other people to form new colonies. The Mok&s;chanes &s;till &s;ay, that before they were di&s;per&s;ed, they inha|bited the countries about all the rivers near the Mok|&s;cha, or Mo&s;cow, (to which they gave their name,) as far as the river Oka, and have been governed by their own little princes. The&s;e are the &s;ame people of
<PB N="52" REF="55">
Mok&s;cha, of whom Stralenberg &s;peaks. They re&s;em|ble the Er&s;anes in many re&s;pects, particularly in their language, and yet differ in many points of female dre&s;s, and the pronunciation of their words, &s;ome of which are peculiar to this race.</P>
<P>This difference is ea&s;ily di&s;coverable, by comparing the female dre&s;s of the Er&s;anes, with the annexed re|pre&s;entation of the holiday dre&s;s of the Mok&s;cha|nian women. The latter have in general more elegance and ta&s;te; their cap is not &s;tuffed &s;o high, nor do they hang any rattling toys to it, but it is only plainly worked with the needle, and the cap tied behind the neck with a &s;tring. Many wear only one band of linen round the head, the ends of which are decorated with open needle-work, and being tied be|hind, hang down more or le&s;s upon their backs. This dre&s;s is very much in vogue about the river Wolga. In the dre&s;s of the women of Mok&s;cha, the &s;everal latchets or &s;trings, which are fa&s;ten|ed to the cap, and hang down on each &s;ide of the bo&s;om, are ornamented with an old Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ilver coin, and on the bo&s;om are joined, acro&s;s at their ends, by little chains and jingling toys. On the brea&s;t-pin, is fa&s;tened a kind of &s;hield, and which is rendered hea|vier, by the quantity of coral, and other clattering or|naments hung to it, than that of the Er&s;anes. About their neck they wear a collar formed of net-work, compo&s;ed of many variegated gla&s;s-beads. From their
<PB N="53" REF="56">
girdle hangs down before a large needle-worked apron, divided into four parts from top to bottom, each of which is pinned to the other, and ornamented at bottom, with long ta&s;&s;els, gla&s;s-beads, and a cer|tain &s;pecies of &s;nail-&s;hells, chiefly brought from India, the <HI>Cyprea nodo&s;a.</HI> Behind, in&s;tead of an apron, hangs down &s;everal black woollen ta&s;&s;els, fa&s;tened on &s;trings of various lengths. They u&s;ed to &s;tick &s;hells and me|dals with pins upon the bo&s;om and neck of their &s;hifts, to encrea&s;e the noi&s;e. But the mo&s;t peculiar part of the dre&s;s of the women of Mok&s;cha, are &s;ome large flying tufts of hair, formed by a &s;hort &s;tick within the lock, and leaving the hair loo&s;e at the end; many of the&s;e &s;hort tails are made and hang between other parts of the hair, which are braided into little tre&s;&s;es. The&s;e tufts are now out of fa&s;hion, and only to be &s;een on old women, who are in fact a&s;hamed to &s;hew them, and often will not wear them, if not induced to it by much flattery and per&s;wa&s;ion. Neither do the women of Mok&s;cha, when dre&s;&s;ed, bind up their feet with linen bands, but with leather latchets or thongs.</P>
<P>The people of Mok&s;cha, as I ob&s;erved before, be|ing now all converted to chri&s;tianity, remember and retain but few of their former cu&s;toms and opinions. They are &s;aid to have differed little from the Er&s;anes. They have uniformly a&s;&s;ured me, that they neither had idols nor &s;ubordinate deities, but always offered
<PB N="54" REF="57">
up their &s;acrifices to an invi&s;ible Supreme Being, whom they did not call <HI>Paas,</HI> as do the Er&s;anes, but <HI>Schkai,</HI> or heaven it&s;elf, and to which they prayed, turning their faces to the ea&s;t. They had altars at di&s;tant pla|ces within the wood, in which they &s;acrificed hor&s;es, oxen, and &s;mall cattle. At the burial of a decea&s;ed per&s;on, the parents were to perform a &s;acrifice, and the mourners were women. They married their chil|dren, before they were grown-up, and frequently gave young women to boys, under a notion of encouraging female indu&s;try, and making the wife by her labour, maintain her hu&s;band. Men were accu&s;tomed to give a portion to their daughters in marriage, which was returned them afterwards, in imitation of all other ea&s;tern nations. When the marriage ceremony took place, the bride, in the pre&s;ence of her own parents, and tho&s;e of her hu&s;band, was &s;et upon a mat and car|ried into the bridegrooms bed-chamber with the&s;e words, <HI>Wot tet Werga&s;s Ut&s;cha,</HI> that is,
<Q>Here, wolf, take the lamb,</Q>
during which ceremony, &s;he was to &s;hew no di&s;inclination or &s;hame-facedne&s;s. At pre&s;ent, after the rites are performed in the Ru&s;&s;ian church, and the bride is returned, &s;he is expected to lament her former &s;ituation exceedingly, and &s;ome indeed do it &s;o &s;incerely, as to tear their hair, and &s;cratch their fa|ces mo&s;t inhumanly. She al&s;o wears a linen veil of needle-work over her face. The day after the nupti|als, the elder of the parents goes in a &s;olemn manner, with a loaf of bread, on which &s;ome little ornament,
<PB N="55" REF="58">
to wear upon the bo&s;om, is fa&s;tened, to give the bride as a pre&s;ent, and this is done by &s;etting it thrice upon her head, uttering the&s;e words, <HI>Zatei, me&s;ei, pawei,</HI> in what order he plea&s;es, but the word which he pro|nounces la&s;t, the bride is to be called by: and, they give their children an accidental and commonly an adjectival name. This is all I could learn from this &s;imple people. They appeared to me to be indu&s;tri|ous farmers, and to breed a great many bees. Some of them are owners of 200 hives, and they are much cleaner in their per&s;on, than their Er&s;anean brethren. Reddi&s;h and light coloured hair is le&s;s frequent among them, than among the Er&s;anes, who&s;e hair is mo&s;tly brown. Their women, like tho&s;e of the Er&s;anes, are in general not pretty, but they are active, diligent, and laborious. Their knowledge of herbs, for the u&s;e of phy&s;ic and dying, is not &s;mall. Round the porches of their hou&s;es, you will con&s;tantly &s;ee &s;ome herb or other hanging up to dry, with a number of cole-wort leaves, which the Mordvines lay under the dough of their bread, to be baked with it, as they leaven it un|commonly &s;trong, and it is apt to run. On this ac|count, they dry a winter's provi&s;ion of the&s;e leaves, wetting them a little when they u&s;e them. Among the the medicinal herbs I &s;aw them make u&s;e of, were the St. John's-wort, <HI>(Hypericum, perforatum,)</HI> which they bind over the face in paralytic ca&s;es; the Engli&s;h marjoram <HI>(Origanum,)</HI> which they dry, reduce to pow|der, and &s;trew over wounds and excoriations of chil|dren.
<PB N="56" REF="59">
The <HI>Virgaurea,</HI> who&s;e a&s;hes they &s;trew over in|flammations of the &s;kin, called <HI>Ery&s;ipelas.</HI> The bog|bean, <HI>(menyanthes,)</HI> and the aconite, <HI>(aconitum,)</HI> which they u&s;e as a poultice for external inflammations, and give internally as a remedy for watery &s;wellings; the leaves of the ra&s;berry-bu&s;h, <HI>(Rubus Saxatilis.)</HI> The clover, <HI>(Tri&s;olium Spadiceum,)</HI> and the common thyme, with water, in inflammations of the eyes, which they are often afflicted with, owing to their &s;moaking cot|tages; the mar&s;h cinque-foil, <HI>(comarum palu&s;tre,)</HI> in ca&s;es of difficult birth.

<P>The Mordvines do not make their butter in ovens as do the Ru&s;&s;ians, but like the Finlanders and Tar|tars, by beating. Like the Ru&s;&s;ians however they pot their fre&s;h chee&s;e, and pour butter on it, to keep it &s;oft. They build their hou&s;es either in the Ru&s;&s;ian or Tartarean method, and lay on large, and pallet-beds, according as they live in the vicinage of either of the&s;e people. The old Mordvine hou&s;es have their doors to the ea&s;t, as <HI>Stralenburg</HI> ju&s;tly noticed, and their ovens &s;tand on the &s;outh-we&s;t corner; in other re&s;|pects they are very narrow and inconvenient, and are for the mo&s;t part, without chimneys.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="60">The face of this country, is open, hilly, and &s;andy, with occa&s;ionally thick fore&s;ts; but the lands round the villages are in pretty good cultivation.</P>
<P><HI>Wja&s;era.</HI> In our way to Pen&s;a, we pa&s;&s;ed through Wja&s;era, about 16 miles &s;hort of it. This town has three churches, one of which they have began to build with &s;tone. Among the hor&s;es that drew our coach, I took notice of a mare, who&s;e hair was finer than common, and on enquiry, found there was a &s;tallion in this neighbourhood, who&s;e progeny was all like this mare. In winter, the&s;e hor&s;es are &s;aid to become woolly like &s;heep.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 9. <HI>Pen&s;a, about</HI> 70 <HI>miles from In&s;ara.</HI> On the 9th of September, at break of day, we reached Pen|&s;a, about &s;eventy miles di&s;tant from In&s;ara. This town, notwith&s;tanding it's buildings are but moderate, yields on account of it's &s;ituation, &s;tanding on a height near the river Sura, and it's churches, a beautiful pro&s;|pect. Trade &s;eems to be the principal turn of the inhabitants, and the &s;hops are as well &s;tored here, as in any town on this &s;ide Mo&s;cow. This has been ef|fected by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a colony, and it being a place where all travellers &s;top. The river Sura flows clo&s;e by the town, and receives the little river Pen&s;a, which runs through one part of it, and &s;upplies the market with great plenty of fi&s;h. They have all the
<PB N="58" REF="61">
&s;maller kind, and the &s;had and &s;almon are caught only in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>In the province of Pen&s;a, are &s;everal di&s;tilleries of &s;pirits from corn, belonging to the nobility, which &s;hew the richne&s;s of this di&s;trict. Some noblemen have here con&s;iderable &s;tuds. An attempt was made to e&s;tabli&s;h a vitriol manufactory, though I do not know, whether the project has &s;ucceeded; but, the enormous quantity of pebbles found in this neighbourhood, which yield vi|triol, de&s;erves &s;ome attention, as they might be worked for the benefit of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>But what is mo&s;t worthy notice in the di&s;trict of Pen&s;a, is the cultivation of woad, which was begun about ten years &s;ince by one <HI>Tawlejef,</HI> a merchant, who has e&s;tabli&s;hed woad-manufacturies in the villages of Kor&s;chiman and Staroi-mat&s;chim. Having been told that the colour here prepared was not good for much in dying, as it lo&s;t it's beauty and liveline&s;s in le&s;s than a year's time; I was induced to enquire into the rea&s;on of it. I went therefore to the neare&s;t, which was up|wards of forty miles from Pen&s;a. The weather &s;ince the 25th of Augu&s;t had been very agreeable, but on the 9th of September, we had a great deal of thunder, ac|companied with &s;tormy and heavy rains. During this weather, I went to Kor&s;chiman on the 12th of Septem|ber, little &s;u&s;pecting the next day to be the fir&s;t day of winter, and we arrived there late at night.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62"><HI>Sept.</HI> 12. <HI>Kor&s;chiman.</HI> Kor&s;chiman is inhabited by Mordvines, of the Er&s;ane race. As the workmen had not done the lea&s;t work for the la&s;t nine months, owing, perhaps, to the ab&s;ence of the proprietor, I could only in&s;pect the place and the implements, and enquire in|to the manner in which they made it; and it appeared to me, that the bu&s;ine&s;s was not well managed, there not being one intelligent and expert man among all the per|&s;ons employed in it, and that it's failure was not owing to the materials. As large quantities of indigo and woad are u&s;ed throughout Ru&s;&s;ia, and it is a profitable article of A&s;iatic commerce, it were to be wi&s;hed, that in&s;tead of purcha&s;ing it of &s;trangers, they would take &s;ome pains to bring the&s;e manufactures to perfection. It would be a great acqui&s;ition to the wealth of the empire. Though the works were here &s;u&s;pended, I did not under&s;tand that the proprietor meant to aban|don his de&s;ign, but to endeavour to carry it on again on better principles.</P>
<P>On our way back, the weather was not only rainy, but, towards night, winter began to &s;alute us with a heavy &s;now: the ground was covered to the height of &s;ome inches, and the young wood, being &s;till covered with leaves, bent under it's weight. Young trees, if once bent down with &s;now, &s;eldom ri&s;e again; of cour&s;e, an early, premature &s;now may do a great deal of damage. The thermometer &s;tood from the 150th to the 155th deg. on the 14th of Sept. the cold dimini&s;hed &s;ome de|grees,
<PB N="60" REF="63">
but at night it froze again, and the fro&s;t was &s;o con&s;iderable, that the mercury during the 15th, at night, pointed at 162 deg. and this part dimini&s;hed but little during the whole winter.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 15. This weather induced me to ha&s;ten my di&s;|tant journey, and I left Pen&s;a on the 15th, which was as &s;oon as I could procure hor&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Seli&s;ka,</HI> 14 <HI>miles from Pen&s;a.</HI> Beyond Pen&s;a we tra|velled through the exten&s;ive fore&s;t of Sura, which reach|ed to Seli&s;ka, near 14 miles, where we were benighted. The Mordvines of this country keep a great many bee|hives, which they leave expo&s;ed abroad and very little &s;heltered from the rigours of the winter. They keep al&s;o a great deal of cattle, but their &s;heep are not of the bet|ter &s;ort, their wool being &s;eemingly interwoven with goat-hair. There being plenty of trees here which yield ro&s;in, mo&s;t of the country people are employed in mak|ing tar. It froze &s;o much this night, that all the rivers were &s;woln with ice.</P>
<P>About &s;ixteen miles further on, at a place called Julok-Gorodi&s;tche, is the remains of an ancient Tarta|rian fortification. It &s;tood upon a plain, erected in form of an irregular &s;emicircle, of about 350 fathoms, hav|ing a &s;trong brea&s;t-work and a ditch. In the centre is a round pit, now &s;unk, probably contrived to hold water for the cattle.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64">We could not reach Simbur&s;ky before the 22d, it being almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to travel by night, for the bad|ne&s;s of the roads, even with additional hor&s;es. The country however abounds with villages, mo&s;tly inhabi|ted by the people of Mok&s;cha. The face of the coun|try is a great deal of high-land, covered with fore&s;ts of pine, in which are many Linden-trees, very advan|tageous to bees. This tree is the mo&s;t u&s;eful of any tree in Ru&s;&s;ia. It's timber is good for a variety of pur|po&s;es, as is al&s;o it's bark, and it's ba&s;t, of which they make mats and ropes. The leaves and tender &s;lips of the Linden, when dryed, is al&s;o a good winter-pro|vi&s;ion for &s;heep in the&s;e places, where they keep &s;o many. The people were here &s;urprized by the winter, and a great deal of hemp, and corn that was not cut, was buried and lo&s;t beneath the &s;now. Tho&s;e fields al&s;o, which were &s;own with winter-&s;eeds, yielded but a di&s;mal pro&s;pect for the en&s;uing year, for they were de|voured by a kind of catterpillar, <HI>(Phaloena frumenta|lis,)</HI> which in the provinces of Ca&s;an, have for &s;ome years pa&s;t been a univer&s;al land-plague; for they devoured the young plants as they ro&s;e, to the very root, as if they had been fed by cattle. However, the wet weather and fro&s;t had killed many of them; for, during the day, they hide them&s;elves in the &s;urface of the earth. There is hardly a better expedient to get rid of the&s;e unwelcome devourers, than to &s;trew tho&s;e fields well, where they are &s;een, as &s;oon as the &s;eed ri&s;es, with a&s;hes of buck-wheat or peas-haulm.</P>

This place &s;tands on very high ground, between the rivers Wolga and Swijaga, and they are &s;o near to each other, as barely to leave room for the city; though the latter runs a cour&s;e of about 70 miles, before it empties it&s;elf into the Wolga. The hill on which Simbur&s;ky &s;tands, is a grey clay, mixed with pyrites, and full of petrifactions. The hill gra|dually falls away on the Swijaga &s;ide, but on the Wol|ga the land is wa&s;hed away, and leaves a very &s;teep bank. In the river and it's banks are found, a vari|ety of petrifactions, and &s;ome very tran&s;parent cry&s;tals. And all the country, between the&s;e two rivers, is &s;o full of vitriolic and &s;ulphureous &s;ub&s;tances, that if manu|factories of vitriol, brim&s;tone and allum were e&s;tabli&s;h|ed

old, &s;ilver coins or tin &s;pangles, with necklaces of coral beads, tied behind with a large, needleworked band, that hangs down the back; to which is fixed, a number of medals, coins, and pieces of tin and fringe, which band is tucked into the girdle; be&s;ides the&s;e, they wear al&s;o two &s;maller lappets, fringed at bottom, hanging from the head to the middle of the back, one on each &s;ide, and joined together by &s;trings of coral beads. This cap is not like that of the Tartarian women, coming down upon the forehead, or &s;itting clo&s;e to the head, but widely extended; &s;o, that both ends of that veil, which the&s;e women call <HI>Ta&s;tar,</HI> and put round their neck, is cro&s;&s;ed under the chin, wound round the head under this cap, and pa&s;&s;ed through a hole in the top of it, where it re&s;embles a tuft; but they have al&s;o caps without holes at top; the&s;e are worn by girls. When they are full-dre&s;&s;ed, the veils they wear are of fine linen, embelli&s;hed with gla&s;s-beads, and pendant corals. The girls' dre&s;s is le&s;s ornamental, not wear|ing the above-mentioned veil; nor has their cap any flap or train behind, but is commonly compo&s;ed of va|rious colours. The&s;e braid their hair, into two or three tre&s;&s;es, and conceal it under their upper &s;hift, In winter, both women and girls wear a kind of man's great coat, made of fur, over their dre&s;s. The mans' dre&s;s is not very different from that of the Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ant, except, that his &s;hirt, about the neck, is work|ed with wor&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="68">The features of the people of T&s;chuwa, betray a &s;trong mixture of Tartarian blood. Their hair is neither light-brown nor reddi&s;h, but commonly black, like that of the Tartars. The features of the women are pretty enough, and they are much more cleanly than the Mordvines. I may &s;ay the &s;ame of their ha|bitations, which, in many re&s;pects, re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Tartars. Their villages are not generally &s;urrounded with pales, but con&s;i&s;t of di&s;per&s;ed dwellings and &s;ome &s;mall huts, on eminences, where they &s;tore their pro|vi&s;ions. According to the old cu&s;tom, the door is on the ea&s;t-&s;ide of the building, which is covered with a large roof, under which, they &s;leep in &s;ummer-time. Within the room is a large bench to &s;leep on, and an oven &s;tanding on the right-hand near the door, fre|quently without a chimney. In imitation of the Tar|tars, the better kind of people &s;leep on good feather|beds, but the poor are contented with ru&s;h-mats.</P>

<P><Q>When a young among them is inclined to marry, he commi&s;&s;ions a friend to bargain with a girl, who always gets her as cheap as he can. The price ge|nerally paid on the&s;e occa&s;ions, is from twenty to fifty rubles, each ruble about 4s. Engli&s;h; but a good chapman will get one for eight, ten, and &s;ome|times for five rubles. The rich will go as far as eighty, and this purcha&s;e-money is called <HI>Golon o&s;ki.</HI> The brides' portion is paid in cattle, furniture and clothes, and is in proportion to the money paid for her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After the&s;e preliminaries, follows a ceremony, called <HI>Ko&s;thenas kayas,</HI> that is, the carrying of the pre&s;ents. The bridegroom and his parents vi&s;it the betrothed bride, pay the purcha&s;e-money, and make her friends &s;everal &s;orts of pre&s;ents, as &s;hirts, cloaths, linen, &amp;c. The girls father on this occa&s;ion, makes an offering to the &s;un, of a loaf of wheaten bread and &s;ome honey, accompanied with a prayer for a happy marriage, and pro&s;perity to the young couple; after this, they &s;it down, eat and drink, and appoint the wedding-day.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The nuptials are thus celebrated. The bride, covered with a veil, hides her&s;elf behind a &s;creen;
<PB N="67" REF="70">
from which, after &s;ome time, &s;he goes and walks round the eating-room, with an air of &s;olemnity. Some young girls then bring her beer, bread and honey, and when &s;he has walked round the room three times, the bridegroom enters, &s;natches off her veil, ki&s;&s;es her, and changes rings with her. From this time &s;he is called <HI>Schoura&s;negher,</HI> or betrothed maiden, and entertains her company with food. She then returns behind the &s;creen, and the married wo|men put on her head the matron cap, which is more adorned than any &s;he wore before.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the evening, when the bride and bridegroom are to undre&s;s, the lady pulls off her hu&s;band's boots; and the next morning, the friends &s;earch for the Mo&s;aical proofs of her virginity, which if not found, a boy who &s;erves, as a &s;ort of a paranymph, pre&s;ents a mug of beer to one of the principal a&s;&s;i&s;tants. In the bottom of this mug is a hole, which the lad &s;tops with his finger, but takes it away, when the per&s;on has the mug at his mouth, and the beer thus runs down his beard and bo&s;om. This makes the com|pany laugh, and the bride blu&s;h. After this, no further notice is taken of her mi&s;conduct. The next day, the bride regales her friends, and they divert them&s;elves with dancing. Even tho&s;e who have em|braced the chri&s;tian faith, omit not this ceremony. The wedding is often held at the hou&s;e of the bride|groom's father, and is a &s;ort of club-dinner, each
<PB N="68" REF="71">
gue&s;t bringing &s;ome eatable with him. Before the meal, a loaf is handed about with a hole in it, into which, &s;uch of the company as find them&s;elves &s;o inclined, put in a little &s;mall money, as a pre&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At the birth of a child, the friends of the parents come to congratulate them, and the fir&s;t comers name the infant, and give it pre&s;ents, by &s;lipping &s;mall pieces of coin into the mug they drink out of. This ceremony is called <HI>Piat&s;chir ghivas,</HI> or cradling the child.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Among the T&s;chouwa&s;ches, the hu&s;band is ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, orders every thing, and his wife impli|citly obeys him; of cour&s;e, dome&s;tic quarrels are &s;eldom heard of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At their funerals, as &s;oon as the grave is filled up, they place lighted torches near it, a cake, and a piece of roa&s;ted hen, &s;aying to the dead, <HI>Amen&s;cha palder,</HI> or, That is for thee. The per&s;ons pre&s;ent devour the re&s;t, and conceive they have eaten with the dead; then, having ca&s;t the old cloaths of the decea&s;ed up|on his grave, they go and bathe them&s;elves, and re|turn to the hou&s;e of their departed friend and fea&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Such of the people of T&s;chuwa, as are not yet con|verted to the chri&s;tian faith, keep the Friday holy, as do the Mahometans, which they call <HI>Aernekon,</HI> but

don't pay the lea&s;t regard to the Sunday. This, and al&s;o the abhorrence of &s;wine's fle&s;h, (which &s;ome few indeed will now eat,) is a cu&s;tom they derive from the Tartars, though they adhere to no other part of their religion. In the&s;e villages, where they live agreeable to their ancient cu&s;toms, the <HI>Sotnik</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A kind of governor, pre&s;iding over <HI>lOO</HI> people cho&s;en by the village.

On which, no one pre&s;umes to work, every one &s;pends the day in prayer and amu&s;ements; after which, each family, but e&s;pecially the female part of it, who are not admitted to be pre&s;ent at &s;olemn &s;acrifices, have &s;aid their prayers before a certain &s;anc|tuary, which they call <HI>Yerig.</HI> This <HI>Yerig,</HI> is nothing but a bundle of fifteen rods of the wild ro&s;e-tree, about four feet long, tyed together in the middle with ba&s;t, from which hangs a bit of tin.

<P><Q>On the Thur&s;day in Pa&s;&s;ion week, every father of a family, &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI> places certain eatables in the yard of his hou&s;e, with a lighted torch near them, to the me|mory of each per&s;on who died in his hou&s;e, and the

dogs, as proxies for the dead, fea&s;t on this provi&s;ion. Even tho&s;e who are converts to chri&s;tianity conceive, that the dead cannot re&s;t in their graves without this ceremony.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The prie&s;ts of T&s;chuwa, are called <HI>Youma,</HI> and &s;erve in the triple capacity of prie&s;ts, fortune-tellers and magicians. They call their &s;upreme being <HI>Thor,</HI> and give him a wife, whom they call <HI>Thor Amy&s;ch,</HI> or mother of the gods. They have al&s;o a &s;ubordinate divinity. <HI>Scha&iuml;tan,</HI> is the chief of their malevolent gods, and has his re&s;idence in the water, and in their prayers, they never omit to be&s;eech <HI>Thor,</HI> that he will vanqui&s;h <HI>Scha&iuml;tan.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Their notion of future exi&s;tence extends to a bli&s;s|ful and mi&s;erable immortality. Good people they &s;ay, are tran&s;planted, after death, to a ble&s;&s;ed abode, called <HI>T&s;chemherda,</HI> or the land of perfect &s;atisfac|tion, where they meet their families, and enjoy their property much more than before. The wicked, they think, will be condemned to wander, after death, as &s;keletons, deprived of fle&s;h, in cold and barren de|&s;arts, &s;hivering, wretched, and forlorn.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At &s;eed-time, they have a fea&s;t for petitioning the gods to give them a fruitful harve&s;t, and after har|ve&s;t they have another thank&s;giving, at both of which they &s;acrifice victims, and make oblations of
<PB N="71" REF="74">
cakes and milk. Their prayers are always the &s;ame, and to this effect. <HI>O God have mercy upon me! O God for&s;ake me not; give me many &s;ons and daughters. O God, give me a great quantity of &s;heaves of corn, and fill my barns with provi&s;ion! O God, give me bread and honey and drink and victuals and health, with tran|quility and re&s;t! O God, fill my yard with hor&s;es, horned cattle, &s;heep and goats! O God, ble&s;s my hou&s;e, that I may lodge and entertain and warm the traveller!

<P>In the neighbourhood of their villages, generally upon &s;ome common near a river, they have a &s;acred place, called <HI>Keremet.</HI> This <HI>Keremet</HI> is a &s;quare piece of ground, &s;urrounded with a hedge about &s;ix feet high, and has three entrances; one in the middle of the ea&s;tern &s;ide, another on the north, and the third on the we&s;t. The &s;ituation of the place is &s;o contrived, that the northern &s;ide leads to the &s;pring or river, as through this gate all the water u&s;ed in the &s;acrifice is fetched. The people enter by the we&s;tern gate, and near the ea&s;tern is rai&s;ed a roof or &s;hed, under which the &s;acrificial fle&s;h is dre&s;&s;ed. Before this &s;hed, is a large table fixed, by fa&s;tening boards upon &s;takes, on which the meat, &amp;c. is laid. Near the northern gate,
<PB N="72" REF="75">
is another large table, whereon they &s;kin and clean the victims.</P>
<P>Large villages have a great Keremet for public &s;a|crifices, and a &s;maller one for private families, who &s;ometimes have a Keremet within their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The people of T&s;chuwa, tho&s;e in the di&s;trict of the river Alatyr, erect in the middle of the Keremet a little, wooden hou&s;e, who&s;e door is towards the ea&s;t, in which they eat the &s;acrifice &s;tanding; for this purpo&s;e, they have long tables, covered with cloths. In the centre of this hou&s;e is erected a high, wooden pole, which pa&s;&s;es through the roof, and has on it's top, an iron ring, flat at bottom and &s;harp at top. But to this pole is no honour paid, nor do they have one in open Ke|remets.</P>
<P>In the month of September, when their harve&s;t is hou&s;ed, and they are ready to &s;ow the winter-&s;eed, the public &s;acrifices take place again. At the&s;e times they offer up a hor&s;e, an ox, and a &s;heep. I never was for|tunate enough to be pre&s;ent at one of the&s;e great fe&s;ti|vals, but I have been told, that they lead the victims through the ea&s;tern gate, and tie them, one after the other, to three &s;takes near the place where the fle&s;h is to be dre&s;&s;ed, untill they have &s;aid their prayers. This act of devotion is performed towards the ea&s;t, with great bowing of all the men. Their common form
<PB N="73" REF="76">
of prayer is <HI>Thor &s;irlaga, Thor biter, Bojant &s;chin bul,</HI> that is, "God, have mercy; God, give us food and pre&s;erve us." But they invoke &s;ubordinate deities, for whom they have particular prayers. The &s;imple folks of T&s;chuwa, could not give me any idea of their mythology, but the following are &s;ome of the names of their inferior deities, which I learned. <HI>Keremet</HI> is the fir&s;t, after their &s;upreme being. Be&s;ides the&s;e, they have <HI>A&s;tyr, K&s;nir, Pulchs, Surodon, Sir, Sjul&s;uren-Ir&s;ene, Chil&s;ir, Kebe,</HI> and perhaps many more, of which pro|bably it would be tire&s;ome to enumerate the particu|lars, or their propriety. It is remarkable, that they give many of their gods a wife and a &s;on, and call upon each of them three times; as for example, <HI>Thor</HI> or <HI>Keremet-a&s;h,</HI> (the father,) <HI>Kermet-amyche,</HI> the mo|ther,) and <HI>Keremet-Uewli,</HI> (the &s;on,) and &s;o on. I heard this from a &s;imple pea&s;ant of T&s;chuwa, who was unable to give me any further account. When pray|ers are over, the victims are immolated by one of the elders, cho&s;en, by the voice of the people, to this of|fice. They carefully pre&s;erve the blood, and proceed as is related, in the Collections of Ru&s;&s;ian Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The &s;kins of the hor&s;e and ox, are hung upon two high poles, in the northern corner of the Keremet; but, the &s;heep's &s;kin is hung over a rail, fixed on &s;takes, &s;tuck in the ground. After hanging two days, they are &s;old among them, but the price is to defray the expences of the &s;acrificial ve&s;&s;els, or el&s;e laid out
<PB N="74" REF="77">
in honey and flour to be made u&s;e of, at future fe&s;|tivals. The care of this, and to keep the &s;acred place clean, is entru&s;ted to a man of their own choo&s;|ing, who con&s;iders the office as an honourable em|ployment, and is called <HI>Keremet Pchagann.</HI> Such &s;a|crifices are al&s;o performed, when there is a pro&s;pect of a bad harve&s;t, before the corn is cut.</P>
<P>Private family &s;acrifices are performed on many oc|ca&s;ions, as in ca&s;es of &s;ickne&s;s, dome&s;tic di&s;tre&s;s, child-birth, and in memory of the decea&s;ed. The father of the family, or the elde&s;t of the relations, having &s;aid prayers, kills the victim, which is chiefly &s;ome &s;mall animal, but generally a &s;heep. Before it is &s;lain, they throw over it a ve&s;&s;el full of cold water, as they do indeed at public &s;acrifices. If the animal &s;hakes it off, they proceed; if not, the ceremony is po&s;tponed to &s;ome other time. After they have eaten the fle&s;h, and whatever is eatable of the victim, they burn the bones, and commit the remainder carefully to the bo|&s;om of the earth, that no &s;acrificial relick may be profaned.</P>
<P>The people of T&s;chuwa, bury their dead full-dre&s;&s;|ed, but in a &s;habby coffin, with the head turned to|wards the we&s;t. They are al&s;o &s;aid to put into the grave, if the decea&s;ed is a man, &s;everal &s;mall tools, a form whereon they work, their &s;hoes made of twi&s;ted ba&s;t, <HI>(Lapti,)</HI> the in&s;trument with which they are
<PB N="75" REF="78">
made, a knife, &s;ome ba&s;t, and a &s;teel to &s;trike fire, as they do in Lapland. The common burial-ground lies at an equal di&s;tance from the village, the Keremet and the high-road, is called <HI>Ma&s;ar;</HI> and the funeral ob|&s;equies are performed at three different times, by the relations and friends of the decea&s;ed; on the three following days, <HI>viz.</HI> the Wedne&s;day in Pa&s;&s;ion-week, the Thur&s;day before Whit&s;untide, on which day, the Ru&s;&s;ians have a &s;imilar ceremony, and on the 8th day of November. On this latter day, they not only per|form a &s;acrifice on the grave, but erect a wooden pillar at the head of the grave. Having dug a hole for this pillar, before they fix it in the ground, each per&s;on pre&s;ent throws a bit of meat and &s;ome of the drink prepared for the funeral, into it; they then eat the &s;acrifice, drink, entertain, and amu&s;e them&s;elves in a variety of ways.</P>
<P>The collections of Ru&s;&s;ian hi&s;tory mentioned above, give a full account of the marriages of the people of T&s;chuwa. The marriage portion paid with the bride, is to the amount of from 50 to 100 rubles, (each ru|ble 4<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> Engli&s;h.) The bride is not &s;uffered to walk on the day of marriage, but is to ride, or be car|ried. Divorces &s;ometimes take place, and the cu&s;tom is, for the hu&s;band of the woman he leaves, to rent her veil in two pieces, one of which he keeps to him&s;elf, and gives the other to his wife.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="79">As they apply them&s;elves much to breeding of bees, they make a great deal of mead; and, they al&s;o have &s;trong beer, with hops, for their fea&s;ts, but drink no whey, which the Tartars are &s;o fond of. Their dan|ces are like tho&s;e of the Mordvines, &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Tartars, and con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal motions of the arms and body, turning round with &s;hort &s;teps, their feet clo&s;e together, beating and keeping very good time. The mu&s;ical in&s;truments u&s;ed on the&s;e occa|&s;ions are a bag pipe, a kind of little fiddle with three &s;trings, and a dulcimer, in form of a cre&s;cent, with about &s;ixteen or eighteen &s;trings.</P>
<P>Their manner of taking an oath de&s;erves al&s;o our notice, and is as follows. He who is to &s;wear, is brought to the Keremet, and there, in the manner of eating the Cor&s;ned, de&s;cribed in Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, eats a cake of flour boiled in water and butter, imprecating cur&s;es on his head, and that what he eats may choke him, if he utters any thing but the truth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hence the expre&s;&s;ion, "May this Mor&s;el be my la&s;t!"</NOTE> To try a man &s;u&s;pected of having taken a fal&s;e oath, they give him &s;alt water to drink, and if he coughs, he is declared guilty. I will only mention one thing more, which is, that the people of T&s;chuwa, who inhabit the heaths and mountainous part of the country, on the left &s;hore of the Wolga, take the by-name of <HI>Werejal,</HI> but call them&s;elves <HI>Chirdijal.</HI></P>

<P>This village is prettily &s;ituated upon an eminence, &s;urrounded with woody heights above.

The&s;e birds, called in Ru&s;&s;ia water-&s;tarlings, dip or dive to the bottom of the water, in &s;earch of in&s;ects and worms, without wetting their plumage. If they are &s;hot on the icy banks of rivers and not killed outright, they will plunge them&s;elves into the water, and don't ri&s;e again till they are dead. The bird, however, cannot be &s;aid to &s;wim, not having

the requi&s;ite organs for that purpo&s;e; but, properly &s;peaking, it flies beneath the water, and clings to the ground, till it has got it's prey. The &s;uper&s;titious countryman fancies, that if any part of the body is anointed with the fat of this bird, it will be for ever free from any injury from fro&s;t. Some a&s;cribe this virtue al&s;o to it's blood. There are al&s;o in the woods, where the water does not freeze in winter, a kind of otter, <HI>Mu&s;tela lutreola,)</HI> very little known, except in Ru&s;&s;ia, called in the Ru&s;&s;ian fur-trade <HI>Norka.</HI> It likes to feed upon frogs and little crabs; but, in other re&s;|pects, does not differ much in his way of living from the common fi&s;h-otter.</P>
<P>On the borders of the river Sok, which I reached on the 12th of October, the country is delightfully plea&s;ant, the lands fertile and rich. This is the we&s;t|ern part of Ru&s;&s;ia, where a number of roebucks are, about the clo&s;e of winter, caught in &s;nares, by the peo|ple of Tartary and T&s;chuwa, who are fond of hunt|ing in &s;now-&s;hoes, and can ea&s;ily overtake them, as the deer are hampered in the &s;now, and cannot well get on. They are a peculiar kind of animal, very dif|ferent from all the &s;pecies of European &s;tags, except as to colour and horns, on which there are many warts. They are of the &s;ize of the fallow-deer, and what is mo&s;t remarkable, have no tail, in&s;tead of which, the hinder part of their breech is covered with a little &s;kinny wart. Their quarters behind are white, and I

am therefore led to &s;uppo&s;e it to be the <HI>Pygargus</HI> of the ancients. The Ru&s;&s;ians call it &s;imply <HI>Dikaja Ko&s;a,</HI> the wild &s;he-goat, and the Tartars give it the name of Saiga. In the&s;e va&s;t uncultivated wa&s;tes are al&s;o a number of elks and foxes; and &s;ome of the latter, are ten of a blacki&s;h colour.</P>
<P>This di&s;trict, as are all the mountainous heaths along the rivers Sok and Kinel, is &s;ome of the be&s;t &s;heep pa&s;ture in all Ru&s;&s;ia; for the common Ru&s;&s;ian &s;heep are larger here, than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The Tartarian village U&s;manowa, or Nadyr-aul, as it has been called from &s;ome principal per&s;on who died a few years &s;ince, and who intended, under a &s;pe|cial order and direction from the &s;uperior office of mines, in the province of Orenburg, dated at Ufa, in 1756, to gather the A&s;phaltos found here, in order to draw an oil from it. For this purpo&s;e, he had begun to erect a manufactory at the &s;ource of the brook Ka|mu&s;chli, to which was to be added another, upon the river Surgut. But all the&s;e preparations were inter|rupted and &s;ubverted, by the unexpected death of this Tartar.</P>
<P>A mile or two &s;outh-ea&s;t of Semenowo, &s;ituated not far from the &s;ource of the river Sok, is an A&s;phaltos &s;pring, on the &s;teep declivity of a mountain, over|grown with birch-trees, who&s;e &s;oil is a fat and black
<PB N="81" REF="84">
earth. This &s;pring has been cleaned, and forms on the mountain, a re&s;ervoir, about three feet wide, and three feet deep, which is not only con&s;tantly full of water without any agitation, but flows over and forms a brook. The water in this re&s;ervoir never free|zes, even in the mo&s;t rigorous winter; and, though &s;ometimes covered with &s;now, the bituminous vapours, which may be &s;melt from far, will &s;oon make an opening through it, though the water po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no extraordinary degree of warmth. It was morning, when I was there, and the thermometer, when in the water, was 138 deg. when in the air, it &s;tood at 160 degrees. In this well, the &s;urface of the water is co|vered with a black and very tough a&s;phaltos, which has the colour and con&s;i&s;tency of thick tar, and as of|ten as it is taken off, will gather again in a few days. It had been &s;cummed clean about a fortnight back, and yet, I took from the &s;urface, more than &s;ix pounds in weight, and a great deal adhered to the &s;ides: it lay on the water half an inch thick. When the a&s;phaltos is removed, a fine and &s;trong oil remains, which might be fired, and would burn as it lies. Even the wa|ter it&s;elf has &s;ome inflamable parts in it, and makes a &s;olution of <HI>litmus</HI> read. The people in the neighbour|hood, u&s;e this bituminous water to gargle their throats, and drink, in the apthae and other infectious and ul|cerous complaints of the mouth and throat. They gather the a&s;phaltos, and u&s;e it as a family-medicine. As a &s;alve, it will cure recent wounds immediately;
<PB N="82" REF="85">
by the addition of butter, as an ointment, it heals all &s;orts of tumours and ulcers; but, their internal u&s;e of it is mo&s;t extraordinary. They take a middling &s;poonful boiled in milk, which renders it thick, drink|ing it warm in violent cholics, inward &s;trains, and hid|den maladies. It makes the patient almo&s;t giddy, throws him into a &s;weat, and is a powerful diuretic, the urine &s;melling &s;trongly of it. It is &s;aid al&s;o, that the pea&s;ants u&s;e it as coomb to grea&s;e their cart-wheels; but, the chief u&s;e, is a medicinal one. Ano|ther property which the a&s;phaltos has, tough as it is, it is of &s;o very penetrating a power, that though I kept it in a cold place, it made it's way through a wooden box, and in a few weeks, eat into a plank &s;ome inches thick. It might be u&s;ed to pre&s;erve wood from cor|ruption, to pay the bottoms of &s;hips, and to keep them from the worms.</P>

<P><HI>Niku&s;chkina, about</HI> 40 <HI>miles from Semenowo.</HI> In the neighbourhood of Niku&s;chkina, about 40 miles from Semenowo, are &s;ome &s;prings, which depo&s;e a &s;ulphu|reous matter. The people of T&s;chuwa, and the re&s;t of the inhabitants, u&s;e the&s;e &s;ulphurous waters as a hot-bath again&s;t the itch, and other di&s;tempers of the &s;kin. It is certain, that the external and internal u&s;e of them would be extremely efficacious, in all cuta|neous
<PB N="83" REF="86">
di&s;orders, and taken internally, might cure many chronical ones.</P>
<P>About ten miles from this, is a remarkable &s;ulphur lake, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in all this di&s;trict. I rode to it by break of day, and found it &s;ituated deep be|tween two high mountains. It is an oblong ba&s;on, over-grown with birches, about 140 yards in length and 113 in breadth. It's a&s;pect is frightful and it's &s;tench, which may be compared to the &s;mell of addled eggs and brim&s;tone, is to be &s;melt at the di&s;tance of three miles; of cour&s;e, it mu&s;t be very di&s;agreeable to be near it. It has no perceptible motion and never freezes, and though the weather was cold when I was there, I found it 30 deg. warmer than the air. Hence it is, that a vi&s;ible thick vapour ri&s;es from it. The water is &s;o tran&s;parent, that one might di&s;cern it's depth, for it is not many feet to the bottom, was it not for the black and grea&s;y ground about it; as it is, it looks like a dreadful gulph. At the time when the &s;ulphur-ma|nufacturers were here, attempts were made to di&s;cover the origin of the &s;ulphur in this lake, but in vain; &s;o that it mu&s;t be hidden in the bowels of this chalk moun|tain.</P>
<P>From the top of this mountain, i&s;&s;ues a &s;ulphur &s;pring, which runs down into this lake, and depo&s;es a &s;ediment, re&s;embling a pure white and thick pulp, and looks as it runs, like thin curds.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="87">It is the continuation of this &s;tream from the lake, that forms the remarkable river called the White-water river, which emptys it&s;elf into the Surgut. This river, as it proceeds from the lake, is about &s;ix feet deep, and it's breadth between 14 and 28 feet. In this channel the water has the appearance of thin curds, but in places where it flows flower, than near the lake, the &s;urface has a fine &s;cum, like that &s;een upon limy waters, and further di&s;tant from, the lake, it's banks, when I was there, were icy; the ice, however, was not &s;olid, but con&s;i&s;ted of a number of flakes upon one-another, like the ice that is found in fre&s;h milk.</P>
<P>All the matter which the water depo&s;es, is but a &s;ul|phur mixed with limy particles. The whole &s;tream was formerly banked with planks, for the u&s;e of the &s;ulphur manufactory, erected upon the river Sok, that they might collect the &s;ulphur with more ea&s;e; but there is now no traces of &s;uch bank left. The manufactories are removed to the Wolga, and this White-water river is neglected.</P>
<P>Where the earth has been dug out to bank up the river Surgat, a thick, black layer of &s;alt-petre earth is &s;een, and a kind of du&s;t, &s;imilar to cinders; among which, lie many lime-&s;tones full of holes, burnt out. This appearance leads me to &s;tart a conjecture, which I will leave to the judgment of my readers, whether there may not have been, formerly, &s;ome vulcanic fires
<PB N="85" REF="88">
in the&s;e mountains; perhaps, &s;ome bituminous and &s;ulphureous layers which ran through them are burnt out, and has &s;ublimated the &s;ulphureous parts into the cliffs of the oppo&s;ite lime-mountains, now proportio|nably wa&s;hed out by the penetration of &s;prings. But this is all conjecture.</P>
<P>The cattle &s;eem occa&s;ionally to have recour&s;e to the&s;e &s;prings, as conducive to their health; but, as they taint the water of the adjoining rivers, no fi&s;h will live in them.</P>
<P><HI>Stawropal.</HI> It was now the 16th of October, and as the winter approached fa&s;t, and the weather grew bad, I thought it be&s;t to return to Simbur&s;ky, and continue there till the &s;pring. I went back therefore, by the way of Stawropal, where I arrived on the 17th. The &s;now was very deep, it having &s;nowed for two or three days. We met here with tho&s;e Kalmucks which are become chri&s;tians, and inhabit the greate&s;t part of the province of Stawropal, wandering with their flocks of &s;heep to tho&s;e winter-quarters allotted them, where in &s;ummer is made or procured, a winter's provi&s;ion of hay, and where they live in their &s;trange way, equally in winter as in &s;ummer, in cots made of felts. They are &s;aid to have begun cultivating a great deal of land, but I per&s;wade my&s;elf, that cultivation is only to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ary wants; for it is not natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that a nation, accu&s;tomed to the freedom and indolence of
<PB N="86" REF="89">
a &s;hepherd-life, would change the &s;weets of &s;uch a &s;tate, for the trouble&s;ome and painful condition of a toil&s;ome one. In Stawropal, re&s;ide their chiefs, who compo&s;e their council of war, and many officers; the&s;e go by particular names, expre&s;&s;ive of their military rank, as <HI>Chorun&s;ha, Je&s;&s;aul,</HI> &amp;c. that is, cornet, adju|tant, and &s;o on, and are all well paid; they have here a <HI>Protopop,</HI> or chief-prie&s;t, &s;ubordinate to whom are many <HI>Pops</HI> or prie&s;ts, cho&s;en by the villages, and al&s;o a phy&s;ician. Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank among them re&s;ide in the town; but the Kalmucks, who are fur|merchants and &s;hepherds, live either in town or coun|try as it &s;uits them, or even in their felt-huts; though few endeavour to acquire more the advantages of a polite life than tho&s;e vagrants, in the &s;tep or wa&s;te of Wolga. The number of converted Kalmucks is &s;aid now to be encrea&s;ed to 14,000; among which, there are a thou&s;and tents of Sjungors, who profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tianity immedi|ately on the arrival of Sjungordan Ulu&s;s, the mi&s;&s;io|nary from the ea&s;tern &s;tep. The &s;heep which they breed, and wherein con&s;i&s;t their chief riches, are mo&s;tly of the broad-tailed &s;ort; but, they produce no good wool; even the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;heep that are mixed with them, degenerate, and have a hairy wool like the Kal|muck; nay, the fir&s;t lambs got by Kalmuck rams, have their tails either half, or wholly bol&s;tered up with fat. Now, as this nation will hardly ever apply them&s;elves to agriculture, the be&s;t way, in my opinion, to make them u&s;eful to the &s;tate, would be, in&s;tead of their
<PB N="87" REF="90">
pre&s;ent flocks, which are fit for nothing but &s;laughter, to give them &s;heep of a better breed, and teach this &s;hepherd-people the method of &s;hearing, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e places, where there is the be&s;t &s;heep feed.</P>
<P>The city of Stawropal, is agreeably &s;ituated on the high, ea&s;tern bank of one of the arms of the Wolga, which they call Kunei-Wolo&s;chka. On the land &s;ide, it is &s;urrounded with delightful hills, over-grown with pines and birch-trees. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Wolga, we &s;ee at a di&s;tance the lofty lime-mountains, called Shigulef&s;ki, from the village Shigulicha, that lies between them. The middle part of the town re|pre&s;ents a fort, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome palli&s;adoes, towers, and a battery. It contains two churches, one built with wood, but the mother-church is hand&s;omely erected with &s;tone. Be&s;ides the man&s;ions of the Woi|wod or governor, there is a court-hou&s;e or chancery belonging to the regency of Orenburg, the dwellings of the chiefs of the Kalmucks, and other military per&s;ons; &s;ome provi&s;ion, and &s;alt magazines, a num|ber of &s;hops, and a &s;chool. Above the &s;ort are &s;eve|ral &s;treets, wherein live the &s;oldiers of the garri&s;on, and the co&s;&s;acks, in which place there is a chapel. The number of hou&s;es amount to about 450.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 19. On the 19th of October, I left Staw|ropal, in order to reach Simbur&s;ky, before the rapid ice-flood came on, which the river Wolga &s;eemed to
<PB N="88" REF="91">
threaten us with. The fir&s;t village we pa&s;&s;ed in our way there, was Sant&s;chalewoi, at the di&s;tance of about thirteen miles. This place is inhabited by divers &s;orts of people, comprehended under the general denomi|nation of <HI>Ky&s;ilba&s;hes,</HI> and &s;ome of the people of Mok|&s;cha. It appears, that &s;ince the building of the Mord|vine villages, the de&s;cendants of the people of Er&s;ania, and tho&s;e of Mok&s;cha are mixed, and that their lan|guage is reduced into one. For example, the Mord|vines who inhabit the environs of the Wolga, don't call their &s;upreme being <HI>Paas,</HI> as do the Er&s;anes, nor <HI>Skai,</HI> like the people of Mok&s;cha, but u&s;e the com|pound word <HI>Skipas.</HI> Be&s;ides this, they have adopted a great many of the T&s;chuwa&s;ch, and are the cleanlie&s;t of all the Mordvines. They clean their tables, forms and walls, with a kind of bru&s;h, which they call <HI>Ili,</HI> but the Tartars, who u&s;e the &s;ame in&s;trument, give it the name of <HI>Schlan.</HI> Their women wear nothing but a piece of linen tied round their heads, both ends of which are elegantly &s;titched, and hang down on the neck behind. I &s;aw &s;ome, who&s;e hair, by the addition of black &s;heep-wool, was braided into a flat tail of two hands in breadth, or in tre&s;&s;es, which reached down to the middle of their legs, and &s;eems to have been the old Er&s;ane ornament. Some, in&s;tead of the u&s;ual apron worn behind, wear a great many black &s;trings, hanging down from the girdle.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="92">Almo&s;t all the villages on this road, are inhabited by Ru&s;&s;ians. Near Nikol&s;koe, &s;outh of the river T&s;cherem&s;chan, are the remains of a &s;trong, Tartarian brea&s;t-work; and, a little behind Nikol&s;koe, we cro&s;s an old Ru&s;&s;ian line or barrier, which mu&s;t be older than that of Sakamia, becau&s;e it is within the latter. This line begins at Beloi-jar, upon the Wolga, and goes to the borough of Eryklin&s;k, which formerly was fortified, and lies at nine miles di&s;tance; from whence it is &s;aid to extend it&s;elf over Tyn&s;k and Biljar, to the river Ik, like the Sakamian line. The ditch of this line, is in &s;ome places twenty-&s;even feet wide. Even in the village Nikol&s;koe, are &s;everal heaps of rubbi&s;h, probably the remains of &s;ome redoubts.</P>
<P>I made the be&s;t of my way to Simbur&s;ky, (&s;ending my baggage-waggon on before,) as the heavy fro&s;t and the badne&s;s of the roads would admit, and reached the &s;lobode or &s;uburbs, oppo&s;ite that city, on the 20th of October, but owing to a north-we&s;t wind, and the abundance of ice collected on the &s;hore, I could not cro&s;s the river till the next day, when by the help of a boat, and walking on the ice, I was able to do it. The fro&s;t here had been &s;o &s;evere, that the Wolga, near a mile broad, was almo&s;t frozen over. This ri|ver is mo&s;t commonly &s;hut up with ice in the fir&s;t week of December, and often much earlier.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="93">This winter I found, was one of the mo&s;t con&s;tant and uninterrupted fro&s;ts, the people had ever remem|bered. The &s;now fell but little, and a very remarka|ble northern-light, which was ob&s;erved on the 24th of November, was the beginning of a violent fro&s;t, which rai&s;ed the mercury in the thermometer, about the mid|dle of December, to 190 degrees. The mo&s;t com|mon and violent winds which blow always in the win|ter on the river Wolga, &s;eem to come from the &s;outh-we&s;t. As the&s;e very winds are the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous to the vines and fruits of the&s;e parts, was the culture of vines to be extended and even to flouri&s;h here, it mu&s;t be on &s;uch &s;pots and hills only, as are &s;heltered.</P>
<P>About fourteen miles above Simbur&s;ky, on the right &s;hore of the Wolga, are the remains of a fortre&s;s, &s;up|ported by a ditch. It is &s;aid to have been erected by the celebrated old depredator Jera&s;im. In this neigh|bourhood coals are found, of &s;o bituminous a quality, that they will kindle with the flame of a candle. In burning, they have an agreeable &s;mell, &s;imilar to gum-anime in it's &s;moke, and con&s;ume to a grey irony a&s;h. The&s;e coals are not dug out of the earth, but are a kind of bituminous layer, that floats upon the river Wolga; though it is probable, if &s;hafts were dug deep enough, the &s;ame kind of coal would be found in the earth; and I am of opinion, it would an&s;wer the expence, as the conveyance by the Wolga
<PB N="91" REF="94">
would be trifling, and it might be conveyed to the re|mote&s;t parts of the empire.</P>
<P>It would have been unpardonable, had I omitted to vi&s;it the celebrated remains of the Bulgarian capital Brjachimof, now called Bolgari, lying about eighty miles di&s;tant from Simbur&s;ky up the Wolga, and upon it's left and low &s;hore; no de&s;cription having been given of the old, remarkable buildings, &s;till &s;tanding there.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 14. On the 14th of December, I went to this place, the celebrity of which &s;eems to have been encrea&s;ed, by it's having been honoured with a vi&s;it from Peter the Great, and the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s: but, not being able to go the neare&s;t way, on account of the ice, with which the Wolga threatened my pa&s;&s;age, I was obliged to go over the mountainous parts, which are covered with wood, and abound with &s;mall game.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed the river Wolga at Tetju&s;chi, a little market-town, lying upon the high-road, about &s;eventy-two miles from Simbur&s;ky. The river here not being &s;o wide, the ice was cro&s;&s;ed in waggons. From this pa&s;&s;age to the village Bolgari, which is built upon the ruins of the ancient city, and lies towards the north-ea&s;t, they reckon fourteen miles. The road leads partly over &s;ome low-lands, which the Wolga occa|&s;ionally overflows, and partly through a high-&s;tanding
<PB N="92" REF="95">
wood of pines, with which the village is &s;urrounded on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>It's &s;ituation is tolerably high, but the land round it is mar&s;hy, and bu&s;hy. It is wonderful, that &s;o con|&s;iderable and populous a city as Bolgari &s;eems for|merly to have been, &s;hould be &s;o badly &s;ituated in re&s;|pect to it's water, which cannot be procured, but by wells. The Wolga runs here in a &s;traight line, for the di&s;tance of three miles, and though the village in|clines to the river, it does not appear, that it ever had it's cour&s;e near this city.</P>
<P>The village now con&s;i&s;ts of above 100 farms, and has been taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by the crown. It lies at the di&s;t|ance of about &s;ixty miles from Ca&s;an. In front, towards the &s;outh, it has a plain, prettily &s;cattered with re&s;in-trees and birch-trees. It is now chiefly under tillage, and has been the &s;pot on which the city &s;tood. This whole plain is encompa&s;&s;ed with a bank and a ditch, which, though decaying, is in &s;ome places, twenty-one feet wide. The fortification has the &s;hape of an irregular &s;emioval, four miles in circuit, and adjoins the declivity on which the pre&s;ent village &s;tands. We can plainly &s;ee, that a deep and dry ditch cro&s;&s;ed this fortre&s;s, from &s;outh-we&s;t to north-ea&s;t, clo&s;e by the ea&s;tern-&s;ide of the village, and &s;eems to be formed by nature. Mo&s;t of the ancient buildings are within the bank. I will give the reader &s;uch a de&s;cription of the mo&s;t re|markable

ones, as the piercing cold and falling &s;now, would allow me.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the village is the &s;cite of a cloi&s;ter, with &s;ome wooden-buildings, and a fine &s;tone-built church. Within the di&s;trict of this cloi&s;ter, which is encompa&s;&s;ed with a hedge, and goes by the name of U&s;pen&s;koi, are many pieces of antiquity. The mo&s;t remarkable is, a mi&s;gir or tower, built with &s;mooth-hewn free-&s;tone, rather more than eighty-four feet high, in pretty good pre&s;ervation. It has a wind|ing &s;tair-ca&s;e to the top, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eventy-two &s;teps, each &s;tep twelve inches and three-quarters high. The&s;e &s;tairs have been repaired, and the tower has been covered with a wooden-roof, and an Arabian in&s;crip|tion within, new written. The entrance is on the &s;outh, and has a &s;trong iron-hinge remaining, on which hung the door. In &s;undry places there are openings, to let in the light; and, adjoining this mi&s;gir, was an irregular, &s;quare building &s;trongly erected, part of the walls of which is now &s;tanding, and &s;eems to have been formerly a hou&s;e of prayer; the tower &s;tands on one corner of it. This wall is built with &s;tones, unequal in &s;ize, clum&s;ily joined, and badly hewn; among which one my di&s;cern flints, lime, &s;and, and &s;everal kinds of &s;tucco, all apparently brought from the mountainous part of the Wolga. Ea&s;t of this, &s;tand the remains of a little, Tartarian hou&s;e of prayer, &s;o|lidly built with &s;tones of different &s;izes, with a vaulted
<PB N="94" REF="98">
roof. The lower part is &s;quare, but the roof is oc|tangular. Each &s;ide is thirty-five feet long. It has been repaired, and converted into a Popi&s;h chapel, de|dicated to one of their &s;aints, called Nikolao, the miraculous. The entrance to this is in the we&s;t front, and the windows or opening, to let in the light, on the &s;outhern &s;ide. On other &s;pots of this enclo&s;ure, are the remains of &s;ome old building, now converted in|to a cellar.</P>
<P>There are four other ancient buildings within the ditch, in good pre&s;ervation, with a great quantity of decayed wall-rubbi&s;h, and ve&s;tiges of habitations. On the we&s;t, are the ruins of a con&s;iderable building, called by the pea&s;ants, the Greek-hou&s;e, but for what rea&s;on, I know not.</P>
<P>Among the great number of erections is a tower, &s;tanding in a field, 350 feet di&s;tant &s;outh-we&s;t from the cloi&s;ter, built with the &s;ame material, as the one I have named, only thicker, and about &s;ixty-three feet in height. Not far from this, towards the cloi&s;ter, are the foundations of &s;ome &s;pacious buildings, among which, the hou&s;e of prayer, which belonged to the tower, probably &s;tood.</P>
<P>Five hundred and &s;ixty feet further to the &s;outh-we&s;t, &s;tands yet a little &s;quare building, made of &s;trong and &s;olid free-&s;tone, the vaulted-roof of which is
<PB N="95" REF="99">
fallen in on one &s;ide. It's entrance is on the we&s;t, and it has a &s;mall window on the &s;outh. In the we&s;t|ern front, on each &s;ide, is a fal&s;e window. It has two &s;imilar ones, on each of the northern and &s;outhern fronts, with this difference, that tho&s;e on the la&s;t two, are farther di&s;tant from each other, than tho&s;e on the we&s;tern. If &s;uppo&s;ition may be admitted, this &s;eems to have been nothing but a hou&s;e of prayer.</P>
<P>The building of which, the principal foundation is now to be &s;een, &s;tanding on the &s;outhern &s;ide of the village, and the very centre of the city's di&s;trict, is much more exten&s;ive and con&s;iderable, and de&s;erves our attention; but, it is &s;carce to be conjectured, for what purpo&s;e it was erected. The country people call it the court-hou&s;e, and I have no good rea&s;on to call it otherwi&s;e. The &s;quare divi&s;ion of rooms of which the foundations may be &s;een, appear to have been en|trances from without, but not to have had any com|munication with the apartments in the middle; and, al&s;o not to have been higher than the &s;econd &s;tory. There are three &s;mall rooms in the ea&s;tern front, two larger ones in the &s;outhern, and an oblong one in the we&s;tern. In it's northern corner, is an oblong, &s;quare foundation, which touches it only at it's angle, and the northern front of the principal building, where the entrance is, &s;hews no &s;igns of &s;ide rooms.</P>

or &s;maller part, is built on a foundation of lime-&s;tone, with large, Tartarian bricks. It's entrance is on the ea&s;t, and in the &s;ide-walls are &s;everal openings, to let in the light. By a cro&s;s-wall, it is divided into a &s;quare anti-chamber, and an oblong &s;aloon. We pa&s;s from the latter into the principal part of the building, which has no &s;econd entrance. This part is built, ex|cept it's top, which is of brick, with hewn free-&s;tone, in pieces fourteen inches broad, and about 6 inches in thickne&s;s. It's greate&s;t &s;pace is divided into four clo|&s;ets, by walls from the bottom to the top; between which, is a broad pa&s;&s;age, in form of a cro&s;s. This cro&s;s pa&s;&s;age receives it's light from an octagonal &s;ky-light

in the roof, be&s;ides a &s;mall window, on each &s;ide. About the large pinnacle or &s;welling roof, are four &s;maller ones, over each corner clo&s;et, which throw the light into the&s;e clo&s;ets only, through an octagonal opening al&s;o in the centre. The in&s;ides of all the&s;e vaulted roofs are concave, and ornamented with &s;tuc|co. The corner clo&s;ets are exactly &s;quare, and have their doors in the angle, leading into the cro&s;s-pa&s;&s;age. At the &s;outhern end of this building, is an addition of three rooms, the ea&s;tern or &s;malle&s;t of which, has no entrance or opening, except a breach into the &s;outh-ea&s;tern corner clo&s;et of the centre building; but, the we&s;tern, which projects from the center-building about &s;even feet, has no communication with that building or the middle room, but it's entrance is from the out|&s;ide, like that of the private clo&s;et for prayer, which has been de&s;cribed in the burial-place of the Khans, at Ka&s;imof. Under the principal part of this building is a vault, in which there is a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age from the &s;outhern wall, as into the &s;epulchral cave at Ka&s;i|mof; but, this vault being broken in, underneath the &s;outhern corner clo&s;et, rendered my de&s;cent im|practicable. From &s;ome pieces of decayed wood lay|ing on it, I conceive it to have been a burial-place. If I am not mi&s;taken, the&s;e buildings may have been partly u&s;ed for a &s;chool, and partly for a &s;epulchre, like tho&s;e ancient ones &s;till to be &s;een in the city of Ta&s;ch|kent.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="103">Near Bolgari have been found a great many ancient tomb-&s;tones, chiefly with Arabian, but &s;ome with Ar|menian epitaphs, with part of which the foundation of the new church of U&s;pren&s;ki are built, and the re|mainder lies &s;cattered about, upon the ground. The&s;e tomb-&s;tones are of various &s;izes, their figure like tho&s;e I de&s;cribed at Ka&s;imof, and &s;ome of them are of the &s;ame bigne&s;s. By order of the Emperor, who &s;hewed his love of arts and &s;ciences upon every occa&s;ion, they were not only exactly copied, but a tran&s;lation was made of all that were legible. Forty-nine have been tran&s;lated, twenty-two of which are dated in the year of the Hegyra, 623. Of cour&s;e, it is natural to &s;up|po&s;e, there mu&s;t have been &s;ome epidemic &s;ickne&s;s in the city that year; the re&s;t are variou&s;ly dated.

I &s;aw al&s;o &s;ome weapons, that are &s;eldom met with, and which Strah|lenberg gives a de&s;cription of; and, a variety of co|rals, that have been turned with a lathe and afterwards burnt, having the form of large buttons, full of little holes, which perhaps may have been u&s;ed, as the beads of a Ro&s;ary.

de&s;cription of this place and it's environs which it de|&s;erves, and which I wi&s;hed to do.</P>
<P><HI>Simbur&s;ky.</HI> The re&s;t of the winter I &s;pent at Sim|bur&s;ky, examining into the animals and fi&s;heries of this di&s;trict; for the bra&s;s and iron manufactories in the neighbourhood, are &s;carce worth notice.</P>
<P>In the mountainous di&s;tricts about the Wolga, the Ru&s;&s;ian marmotes are often met with, in whole troops or families, great numbers of badgers, and very fine ermine, and ferrets innumerable. But the common wea&s;el, which throughout Ru&s;&s;ia and Siberia, becomes in winter, white as &s;now, is not to be found here. Mr. <HI>Linnaeus</HI> was unacquainted with the European wea&s;el, only in it's winter fur, which changes white at that time of the year in all northern countries, like the er|mine and the hare. (See Lapland and Norway.) It's fur in &s;ummer-time, is of a black-brown colour, but the fur of tho&s;e which are bred in the &s;outhern parts of Europe, are of a beautiful yellow-red. I have &s;een the ermine from the Molucca I&s;lands, which like the wea&s;el, in the &s;outhern climes, never changes it's fur. <HI>Buffon</HI> ju&s;tly a&s;&s;erts, that the ermine is an animal pecu|liar to northern countries alone.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common animal of all here, is the &s;tep-mou&s;e, <HI>(Mus Citillus,)</HI> which in all the open de&s;arts and heaths, between the Wolga and the Don, to the
<PB N="103" REF="107">
53d degree of latitude, has a mo&s;t beautiful, &s;potted fur, and as it is ea&s;y to be caught, I wonder it is not. But in all the &s;outhern countries, &s;ituated from the ea&s;tern part of the Wolga to Siberia, this animal not only increa&s;es in &s;ize, but it's fur is grey and &s;peckled, and it has a bu&s;hy tail, and re&s;embles the marmot, both in appearance and manner. The&s;e di&s;tricts &s;warm with pernicious field-mice, two kinds of which are but little known, the <HI>Mus agrarius,</HI> and the <HI>Mus mi|nutus.</HI> They are generally found in the open fields, under heaps of corn &s;et up there, in the Ru&s;&s;ian way.</P>
<P>The mu&s;k-rat, common in all the lakes about the Wolga, is al&s;o remarkable for it's fur, which is very cheap, and u&s;ed only to border, common fur clothes. Notwith&s;tanding this, it's wool is &s;oft and fine, equal to that of the beaver in &s;oftne&s;s and brightne&s;s, and though &s;horter, perhaps might be equally good for the manufacture of hats.</P>
<P>Of the common &s;orts of wild fowls, there are plen|ty of the bu&s;tard kind, <HI>(Tetrix,)</HI> and partridges. Both are caught during the winter, in &s;nares and nets. Woodcocks are &s;carce to be found, only in the pine-woods about the Wolga, and a &s;pecies of grou&s;e, <HI>(T. Bona&s;ia)</HI> is &s;ometimes met with, but as &s;eldom. Of rare birds, I met here with the wood-pecker, <HI>(picus tridactylus.)</HI> The &s;malle&s;t falcon, <HI>(Falco minutus,)</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="108">
which is not much larger than a thru&s;h; a kind of grey hawk, <HI>(Falco ru&s;ticolus,)</HI> called here <HI>Lunn,</HI> and a remarkably beautiful kind of blue tit-mou&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Parus indicus Aldrovandi.</HI> Raj. <HI>Syn.</HI> av. p. 74. n, 7.</NOTE>, com|mon from the Wolga to Siberia; and, the water-&s;tar|ling, <HI>(Sturnus cinclus,)</HI> may be &s;een, throughout the whole winter, in &s;everal adjacent rivers, which do not freeze, as the Uren, Kamajur, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I don't believe there is a river in Europe &s;o full of fi&s;h as the Wolga, including all it's arms or branch|es. It not only &s;erves all the neighbouring di&s;tricts, but this river, and the Jaik, &s;upplies the whole empire. Though the fi&s;heries will be properly de&s;cribed in the lower parts of this river, I will mention what I &s;aw here.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e fi&s;hes, which are caught in the Wolga only, (not in it's branches,) are the &s;turgeon, the horn-back, the hu&s;o or i&s;ingla&s;s fi&s;h, and the &s;almon. The more common kinds are the barble, the &s;had, the gold-eye, and another called <HI>T&s;chechon.</HI></P>
<P>The Bjeluga &s;turgeon is often caught in this river, from thirteen to &s;ixteen feet long, and from 1200 to 1800 pounds in weight; but, the &s;malle&s;t kind of this fi&s;h, which is mo&s;t frequent, is five or &s;ix feet &s;horter than the former. The horn-back, <HI>(O&s;&s;etr,)</HI> is caught
<PB N="105" REF="109">
from three feet in length to near &s;ix, and weighs from twenty pounds to eighty. The little hu&s;o, <HI>(accipen&s;er Ruthenus,)</HI> which is peculiar to the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, and has no other name, is not longer, when full-grown, than about twenty-eight inches, and weighs about twelve pounds.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o here another kind of &s;turgeon, not much bigger than the hu&s;o, but &s;haped like a &s;turgeon, and is very rough and thorny. They call it <HI>Ko&s;tera;</HI> but having compared many of the&s;e fi&s;hes of a differ|ent age, I am confident, that they are only young &s;turgeons, and that the older they grow, the more they improve in &s;moothne&s;s and fat.</P>
<P>The red-&s;almon which they have here, is only &s;een in the two la&s;t months of the year, and is even then very rare in the Wolga; but, the white-&s;almon comes up this river, from the beginning of January to June. They are from twenty-one inches, to three feet in length, and do not exceed 30lb. in weight. The bar|bel is &s;omewhat heavier, and about four feet in length. But the general &s;ize is three feet. The &s;had, <HI>(Som,)</HI> has been &s;een here &s;ix feet long, and 120 pounds in weight. It is caught commonly in &s;pring and autumn, and is thoroughly a fi&s;h, well known for his waving motion, in order to avoid the net, or tear it to re&s;cue other fi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="110">The gold-eye, <HI>(clupea alo&s;a,)</HI> which, on account of it's colour, is called <HI>Sheleniza</HI> or iron-fi&s;h, or from a whim&s;ical opinion, that eating it will turn per&s;ons mad, <HI>Be&s;chenaja Ryba,</HI> or mad-fi&s;h, comes up the Wolga in prodigious &s;hoals, from the beginning of May to the end of &s;ummer, and frequently load the nets, to the di&s;plea&s;ure of the fi&s;hermen. The Ru&s;&s;ians throw this fi&s;h away, or &s;ell it at a cheap rate to the Mordvines, and the people of T&s;chuwa, who eat them fre&s;h, or dry them for winter provi&s;ion. It is a fi&s;h that would eat very well &s;moked, and &s;upply the lower cla&s;s of people, if they could get rid of that fooli&s;h prejudice, that &s;uch as eat it, will go mad.</P>
<P>The T&s;chechon, <HI>(Cyprinus cultratus,)</HI> is caught in &s;pring, in va&s;t quantities, with the gold-eye, and is much of the &s;ame &s;ize, but on account of it's dry na|ture but little e&s;teemed; of cour&s;e, it is only eaten by the poor, &s;ometimes fre&s;h, and &s;ometimes &s;alted.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e fi&s;hes, the Wolga and all it's branches are full of others generally known, perch, bream, trout, &amp;c. But the eel is never met with, neither in the Wolga, nor any of the rivers or brooks that flow into it, nor in the neighbouring lakes, nor is it &s;een in all Siberia. But in&s;tead of the eel, they catch the quab plentifully, by hooks baited with pieces of fi&s;h, and laid in the winter-time underneath the ice. The
<PB N="107" REF="111">
Wolga is al&s;o crowded with crabs of an extra|ordinary &s;ize, but of a bad ta&s;te. The common people cannot endure the &s;ight of them, of cour&s;e, they are only eaten by the better cla&s;s, and the inhabitants of great towns, who are free from the&s;e vulgar prejudices. They are caught plentifully in winter, by making holes in the ice, and letting down a round flat piece of ba&s;ket-work, in the middle of which they tie a piece of fi&s;h, and when they crawl on it to get at their prey, are drawn up.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce a place in the world, where they make u&s;e of &s;o many whim&s;ical and ingenious ma|chines or in&s;truments for fi&s;hing, as on the river Wol|ga. Not to mention their common ca&s;t and drag-nets, their ba&s;kets, and bow-nets, they u&s;e another method, which is a kind of &s;nare, and de&s;erves to be de&s;cribed. Choo&s;ing &s;uch places in the river for this &s;nare, where the bed of it is flat, to about the middle of the chan|nel; at the bottom of &s;uch places, they drive in &s;takes, about half a yard a&s;under, acro&s;s that part of the river, either in a &s;traight line, or an obtu&s;e angle, which opens downwards with the &s;tream, the top of the &s;takes &s;tanding above the water. Again&s;t the&s;e &s;takes they place hurdles of ba&s;ket-work, as high, as will reach from the bottom of the river to it's &s;urface. The&s;e hurdles are &s;unk between the current and the &s;takes, and kept in their places by &s;tones and the
<PB N="108" REF="112">
&s;tream, driving again&s;t them. This is de&s;igned to ob|&s;truct the pa&s;&s;age and make the fi&s;h turn a&s;ide, to &s;eek another way. Now, in &s;ome part of this ba&s;ket-work, an opening or entrance, &s;ixteen or eighteen feet is left, into a &s;quare place made in the &s;ame manner, and clo&s;|ed on three &s;ides with hurdles, wherein the fi&s;hes &s;wim; the third &s;ide of this &s;quare place being open, leads to other enclo&s;ures, in a kind of labyrinth, and all in the cour&s;e of the &s;tream, and inclining to the &s;hore. Over the&s;e &s;nares or enclo&s;ures, the ice is con&s;tantly broke, and over the holes a thatched &s;hed is erected, to &s;helter the fi&s;hermen who wait here, and who have a fire occa&s;ionally, to warm them. The &s;hed is large enough to admit the men to walk round the enclo|&s;ures.</P>
<P>Now it is ea&s;y to conceive, that a fi&s;h, &s;wimming along the hurdles to find a pa&s;&s;age, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily go into the&s;e enclo&s;ures; but, to know the arrival of &s;uch fi&s;h and &s;eize it, the following method is made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>A piece of netting &s;tretched on a frame, or a piece of ba&s;ket-work, the exact &s;ize of the bottom of the enclo&s;ure is let down in each, with &s;trong ropes fixed to each corner, to draw it up, when they have occa&s;ion. Over the entrance into the&s;e enclo&s;ures, is a &s;mall floating piece of wood, with a number of &s;trings, that go down to the bottom, and are there fixed in a frame

<PB N="109" REF="114">
below, &s;o that every large fi&s;h that enters, mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily touch &s;ome one of the&s;e &s;trings, which moves the float above, and gives the fi&s;hermen notice. Over the opening in each enclo&s;ure, is a net, perpendicular|ly erected on a frame, which they can &s;lide down by means of two perpendicular poles, at plea&s;ure; and, as &s;oon, as they know of a fi&s;h being in the enclo&s;ure, they &s;lide down the net and draw up the frame and this net, at the &s;ame time, thus hemming in the fi&s;h, which they take with hooks. This done, they let down the frame again. Three men are employed in this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But not to be con&s;trained to &s;it up the whole night watching, they have contrived a method, that the fi&s;h &s;hall en&s;nare him&s;elf, and give notice to the fi&s;hermen. This is by hanging &s;ome &s;tones to the bottom of the &s;liding net or grate that &s;huts up the entrance, and making it drop of it&s;elf, and this is effected in the manner of the door of the common rat-trap, by a &s;mall piece of wood fixed at the entrance into the en|clo&s;ure, which gives way on being touched by a fi&s;h in it's pa&s;&s;age, and communicating with a piece of me|chani&s;m above, lets the net or fall-gate down, and at the &s;ame time rings an alarm-bell, which wakes the &s;leeping fi&s;hermen, and gives them notice of the event.</P>
<P>This ingenious piece of mechani&s;m is fixed in the river in &s;ummer-time, in proportion to the height of
<PB N="110" REF="115">
the water, and remains there till the ice drives, in or|der to catch Wolga &s;turgeons and other great fi&s;hes, which &s;wim up the &s;tream. When the ice begins to drive, it is removed till January, and then made u&s;e of, till the breaking of the ice in &s;pring, this being the &s;ea&s;on of &s;almon-fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>'Every &s;pring and autumn,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>
<Q>the&s;e hur|dle enclo&s;ures undergo a thorough repair, and in deep waters, a number of divers are employed, to examine all the lower parts and amend them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t lively imagination to repre&s;ent the extreme fatigue and the different hard|&s;hips the&s;e divers undergo. Ju&s;t before they go into the water, they drink a dram of brandy, and then get upon an oven made extremely hot, near the end of this hurdle fence. Here they continue half an hour, then wrapping their &s;heep-&s;kin &s;hube about them, they get into the boat, throw off their cloths, when they come to the place to be examined, make the &s;ign of the cro&s;s three times on their forehead and brea&s;t, and are let down by degrees to the bot|tom of the river. In this &s;u&s;pended &s;tate, they are alternately drawn up and let down again, that they may examine the whole apparatus. Want of breath obliges them to be drawn up now and then, above the &s;urface. This they repeat, till &s;hivering with cold all over, they find their limbs begin to &s;tiffen, and refu&s;e to perform their office. They then take
<PB N="111" REF="116">
another dram, repair to the oven to re-heat them&s;elves, and begin their work afre&s;h; and they repeat the&s;e alternatives of heat and cold, till the blood gu&s;hes out at their no&s;e and ears, and they are ca&s;t half dead into the boat, which is con&s;tantly near them. The &s;tronge&s;t of the&s;e divers cannot remain more than &s;even minutes under water, nor &s;upport the&s;e &s;udden tran&s;its from heat to cold more than five times a day; and, as it generally requires &s;even days to repair the works thoroughly, the diver is con|demned, during that period, to experience all the con&s;equences of being &s;tunned in this mo&s;t violent and extraordinary manner. Their health, as the reader will naturally conclude, is much impaired by this tormenting practice, and none of them ever reach the ordinary term of human life, but die whil&s;t in their youth. No man can follow this dreadful trade longer than ten years, and numbers are forced to relinqui&s;h it, in the third or fourth year.</Q></P>
<P>Among the various kinds of fi&s;hes caught in the Wolga, the &s;everal &s;pecies of &s;turgeon, and the white-&s;almon, are the mo&s;t excellent and profitable, as to price. The latter, as long as the fro&s;t continues, are tran&s;port|ed fre&s;h into the northern parts of Ru&s;&s;ia, but after|wards &s;alted and &s;moked like the red-&s;almon; the art of &s;moking fi&s;h, however, they know but little of; if they knew better how to cure it, both kinds of &s;almon would be excellent food.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="117">The various kinds of &s;turgeon caught in this river in &s;ummer and autumn, are put by hundreds into the large ponds, near the Wolga, which the floods leave in hollow places, in the low grounds, and are left there all the winter. They are drag|ged to the&s;e lakes or ponds, by ropes, pa&s;&s;ed through the mouth and out at the gills. As &s;oon as the winter grows milder, they are taken out with a net, from un|derneath the ice, in the&s;e lakes, and tran&s;ported in a frozen &s;tate.</P>
<P>The roe of this fi&s;h, which is the celebrated <HI>Caviar</HI> as they call it, is con&s;idered as the greate&s;t delicacy, and the nice&s;t part of the whole &s;turgeon, and is con|veyed to great di&s;tances in this country, in winter-time, without being &s;alted. The large&s;t Wolga &s;tur|geons will produce &s;ometimes 200lb. of roe, and as five eggs of this roe weigh but one grain, it may ea&s;ily be calculated, how many millions of eggs the roe of &s;uch a fi&s;h mu&s;t contain, not le&s;s than near eight mil|lions; but what is &s;till more remarkable is, that though few fi&s;hes come up the river to &s;pawn, no young &s;tur|geons are ever caught or &s;een. The roes of other &s;turgeons do not weigh more than thirty pounds. In &s;ummer, they &s;alt and export, in barrels, large quanti|ties of this roe or cavear. The method of &s;alting it is this. After the roe is cleaned of it's &s;kin and ve&s;&s;els, and well &s;alted, they put it into boxes that have holes in the bottom, and pre&s;s it with heavy weights, &s;o that
<PB N="113" REF="118">
the moi&s;ture drains from it. This done, they wring it in linen rags, pre&s;s it into barrels, and pour fi&s;h-fat over it, to prevent it's corrupting. In other places, they pre&s;erve the roes of &s;almon and pike; &s;calding the latter in boiling water before they &s;alt it, in order to remove it's vi&s;cidity: but, the plentiful roe of the barbel and bream, are con&s;idered as unwhole&s;ome, and given as food, to gee&s;e and poultry.</P>
<P>Of the other &s;pecies of &s;turgeon, they throw no part away. It's inte&s;tines are partly eaten when fre&s;h. A &s;trong tendon which this fi&s;h has upon it's back, is ta|ken out before it is &s;alted, and when dryed, &s;old as a great dainty, by the name of <HI>We&s;iga.</HI> Of the air-bladders they make i&s;ingla&s;s; for, this purpo&s;e, they choo&s;e tho&s;e of &s;turgeons in preference, as having the &s;tronge&s;t vi&s;cidity. The&s;e bladders are &s;oaked in wa|ter, and after the external &s;kin is taken off, the inter|nal part, which is the i&s;ingla&s;s, is rolled up and dried. The be&s;t &s;ort is rolled up, the &s;econd be&s;t laid together in leaves like a book, and the wor&s;t &s;ort is merely dri|ed, and &s;old at a low rate. Farther down the river Wolga, the make a fine glue, by boiling the fre&s;h bladders, and ca&s;t it in moulds of various forms. Upon the river Oka, where they have only the little hu&s;o, they beat the bladder out thin, in the &s;tate it is taken from the fi&s;h, and dry it. On the Wolga, they u&s;e &s;had-bladders for this purpo&s;e, but the&s;e they brui&s;e and pa&s;s through a &s;ieve. The &s;tronge&s;t of this &s;ort
<PB N="114" REF="119">
of glue is u&s;ed by the joiners. They have begun now in &s;ome places, to make fi&s;h-glue from the barbel.</P>
<P>The &s;had, among&s;t their large fi&s;hes, is the lea&s;t e&s;|teemed, yet the &s;kin of this fi&s;h, being thin and &s;mooth, like that of an eel, when the &s;kins of other fi&s;hes are thrown away, is &s;pread and dried, and &s;old to the country people, e&s;pecially tho&s;e among the Tar|tars, to form their windows of, (&s;ee Lapland,) being as tran&s;parent as horn. They u&s;e al&s;o for this purpo&s;e, the peritonaeum of animals, cleaned and dried. I found the &s;had-bladder excellent for covering of bottles, in which animal preparations are pre&s;erved, as it keeps out moi&s;ture, better than other bladders.</P>
<P><HI>T&s;chirikowo.</HI> By an excur&s;ion to the village T&s;chi|rikowo, at the di&s;tance of twenty miles from Simbur|&s;ky, I met with &s;ome other curio&s;ities. This village is &s;ituated upon the brook Birut&s;h, which flows into the Swijaga, and which is not only remarkable for its trout and mother-of-pearl which is found in it, in common with other adjacent waters, but for there having been elephant's bones di&s;covered there about the &s;hores. I have my&s;elf &s;een &s;ome work made of an elephant's tooth, found 200 years ago in this place, which had taken a light yellow colour. Many other bones, par|ticularly a &s;kull of an elephant, have at &s;undry times been found in the banks of this river. I have al&s;o &s;een &s;ome workman&s;hip of ivory, made of a tooth
<PB N="115" REF="120">
found here, equal to the &s;ounde&s;t ivory, only that the point of the tooth was a little decayed. So, that it may be matter of wonder, that a bone could remain after a length of years pa&s;t memory, without decay. In &s;everal &s;pots, human bones they &s;ay are al&s;o found in great quantity. If this be the ca&s;e, it will be no &s;mall matter of triumph to &s;ome writers who, a&s;cribe all the elephant bones found in the northern di&s;tricts, to former wars. But there are more probable arguments to a&s;cribe the&s;e relicks to, which are di&s;per&s;ed as far as the icy ocean; to &s;ome higher and more important ca|ta&s;trophes of the earth.</P>
<P>1769. <HI>March</HI> 10. I left Simbur&s;ky on the 10th of March. A winter journey leaves but little opportu|nity for u&s;eful ob&s;ervation, and the road back to Staw|ropal is now &s;ufficiently known, to need any more to be &s;aid of it. The winter-road was over &s;o many heaths, and the &s;now lay &s;o deep, that we were obliged to walk the whole night on the 10th, and reached Stawropal, the next evening.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 16. Some little matters I had to adju&s;t, de|tained me at Stawropal till the 16th. The chain of lime-mountains, which compo&s;e the &s;hore of the Wol|ga, and are upwards of 700 feet high, are but barren walls of rocks and torn cliffs, but they plea&s;e the eye by their variety, and &s;trike it with wonder. The great quantities of birds of prey, that inhabit the&s;e rocky
<PB N="116" REF="121">
&s;hores, building their ne&s;ts here in &s;ummer, are beyond de&s;cription. The whiti&s;h eagle, <HI>(Vultur albicilla,)</HI> is frequently met with on the&s;e mountains, even in win|ter; and, many beautiful hawks build al&s;o their ne&s;ts in the cavities. Here is plenty al&s;o in &s;ummer, of a curious kind of wild-ducks, <HI>(Anas rutila,)</HI> who&s;e fea|thers re&s;emble the colour of the red-fox. There are a few reddi&s;h or black bears, and al&s;o &s;ome lynxs, in the thick fore&s;ts of the&s;e mountains, not many mar|tens, but a fine &s;ort of large &s;quirrels, inclining to white. The fur of this animal, is the &s;econd be&s;t in Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>About forty miles from Stawropal, near the mouth of the river Sok, is a high-hill, called Zarew Kurgan, with a round ba&s;e. From every appearance, and every rational conjecture, this mountain &s;eems to have been torn from the lime-mountains on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, and to owe it's roundne&s;s to accidental inun|dations; but, according to common report, it is &s;aid to have the following, incredible origin. The &s;tory is differently told, but, the tenor is to this purpo&s;e: that in very early days, an enormous army, pa&s;&s;ing this di&s;|trict, the commander, in order to erect a monument to his power, is &s;aid to have ordered each &s;oldier to carry a cap-full of earth upon this &s;pot, and that thus the hill ro&s;e; but, what is much again&s;t the &s;tory is, the hill's con&s;i&s;ting of large pieces of rock, which could neither be put within the &s;mall &s;pace of a cap, nor be
<PB N="117" REF="122">
carried by any one man. Some encrea&s;e this marvellous account, by adding, that the &s;ame army went back the &s;ame way, and having unfortunately lo&s;t a great number of men, each &s;oldier was commanded to take away a cap-full of earth from it, and notwith&s;tanding this, this large hill is &s;till left.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of this hill, near the village Podgory, a manor, belonging to Count Orlof, &s;tands the village Sernoi-Gorodok, to which the &s;ulphur ma|nufactory was removed in the beginning of this cen|tury, from the river Sok. It is built along the &s;teep &s;hore of the Wolga, at the bottom of that very moun|tain, where the famous ma&s;&s;y &s;ulphur is dug, and con|tains about forty dwelling-hou&s;es, and &s;ome buildings belonging to the manufactory.</P>
<P>The very day of my arrival at the town of Samara, it thawed, and the weather was &s;o exceedingly mild, during the latter days of March, that &s;oon after the heights of Samara were expo&s;ed to the beams of the meridian &s;un, they lo&s;t their hoary heads, and though it &s;nowed violently on the la&s;t day of March and the fir&s;t day of April, it &s;o quickly di&s;appeared the en&s;uing days, that on the 12th day of April, the meadows be|gan to look green, and as the ice upon the Wolga daily decrea&s;ed, I made a vi&s;it to &s;ome of the adjacent parts, before all the &s;now was melted.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="123">By the middle of April, every appearance of win|ter was gone. Spring took it's place; the palm and the hazel began to bloom, and all the heights were delightfully enamelled with the &s;tar of Bethlehem, the &s;ilver-weed, phea&s;ant-eye, violets, and a kind of wind-flower, the <HI>anemone patens.</HI> The birches and &s;ervice-trees put forth their leaves, and were followed on the 20th by every other bu&s;h. Before the end of the month, the wild apple-tree, which in this di&s;trict is con&s;idered as the mo&s;t common bu&s;h, began to blow, and all nature looked gay.</P>
<P>The aquatic birds were &s;till earlier &s;een. On the 19th and 20th of March, we &s;aw wild &s;wans and wild gee&s;e, and on the 25th, the open waters were crowded with ducks. The lapwing's plaintive notes were heard on the 20th, and followed, before the end of this month, by every other water-fowl, I took notice that the&s;e birds came from the we&s;t and north-we&s;t, as they do in other parts of Europe; but, the birgander, <HI>(Onocrotalus,)</HI> the &s;tork, (of which they have here a white kind,) and other land-fowls, came from the &s;outh. Among the land-birds, the fir&s;t that made it's appearance in the middle of March, was the crow, and at the end of March, the wild-pidgeon, the &s;tarling, the plover, and a kind of lark, <HI>(Alauda Alpe&s;tris,)</HI> which latter was as abundantly to be met with, during the whole &s;pring, as the &s;parrow. In the mean time, the mou&s;e, <HI>Citillus,</HI> which has already been mentioned,
<PB N="119" REF="124">
crept out on all tho&s;e &s;pots where the &s;now was melted, and coupled. The in&s;ects were not vi&s;ible, but with the flowers; tho&s;e I fir&s;t &s;aw, were &s;ome butterflies and glow-worms, but neither the&s;e nor the warmth of the days, induced a vi&s;it from the &s;wallow, till the 16th of April, on which day I &s;aw &s;everal, with the bee-eater, <HI>(Merops,)</HI> which convinces me they are birds of pa&s;&s;age, or they would have appeared as &s;oon as others. It has been &s;aid, that &s;wallows, in winter, retire to the water, but the Ru&s;&s;ians know nothing of this fabulous account, or they would contradict it; for, there is no country that fi&s;hes &s;o much, and &s;weeps the waters, frozen or not frozen, with all kinds of nets. The u&s;ual autumnal and heavy fro&s;ts drive all &s;wallows from the&s;e di&s;tricts early; but, in the milder parts of Europe, it may ea&s;ily be conceived, that &s;ome of the&s;e birds, after having tarried too long, and become too feeble and di&s;abled, from the rigor of the &s;ea&s;on, to take a long journey, may creep into the water, or &s;ome hollow ground.</P>
<P><HI>Samara.</HI> Before I proceed farther, I will give the reader &s;ome &s;hort account of the town of Samara. This place is &s;ituated on the angle which the northern mouth of the river Samara forms with the Wolga, but &s;tands chiefly on the Wolga bank. It was formerly a garri&s;on, and had a wooden fort, but was burnt down in 1703. In 1704, they erected a new one, with de|files, on a hill, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, between the Wolga
<PB N="120" REF="125">
and Samara, which is to be &s;een. The chief &s;upport of this town, which continues to flouri&s;h, is breeding of cattle, and their great commerce is in fre&s;h and &s;alt fi&s;h, and roe, <HI>(Cavear.)</HI> To carry on this trade, when the weather is open and the roads pa&s;&s;able, they travel over the &s;teps in caravans to the river Jaik, to fell their provi&s;ions to buyers or merchants, who come there from all the northern and we&s;tern di&s;tricts. On account of this commerce, they throw a temporary bridge over the Samara to a road, that leads &s;traight to the capital of the Ca&s;&s;anians, who live near the ri|ver Jaik. On this road, there are many way-hou&s;es at certain di&s;tances, for the accommodation of travel|lers.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Samara, have &s;ome fi&s;heries on the Wolga, at a di&s;tance from the town, but in cer|tain reaches of the river, which they con&s;ider as be|longing to them. Be&s;ides their own cattle, they traf|fick with the Kalmucks for &s;heep-&s;kins, and tallow. They have no manufactories, except a few tanneries, without the town, and &s;ome very incon&s;iderable ones of hides and &s;ilks. The citizens or burghers of Samara, belong to a court dependant on the regency of Ca&s;an; but, the people of Ca&s;an, that live in and about Sa|mara, are numbered among tho&s;e of the di&s;trict of Orenburg, and formerly, the whole town belonged to it.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="126">In winter, Samara is full of trading Tartars from Ka&s;imof, who come here with lamb-&s;kins, which they barter for with the Kirgians and Kalmucks, and which they bring here to get tanned and &s;ewed toge|ther by the chri&s;tian Kalmucks who re&s;ide in this town, before they carry them to Mo&s;cow, and other places. Mo&s;t of the fine lamb-&s;kins &s;old in Ru&s;&s;ia, are brought from this place, as al&s;o the &s;kins taken from the legs of lambs and fewed together by the Kalmuck women, and which are &s;old as furs. The thread u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e, in common, is drawn from Ru&s;&s;ian linen, in lengths about an ell long; but, what they u&s;e for them&s;elves, is made from the divided &s;inews of ani|mals; a kind of fine cat-gut.</P>
<P>The ice no &s;ooner leaves the Wolga, but a great many &s;hips and barges are &s;een, pa&s;&s;ing and re-pa&s;&s;ing to and from A&s;trachan, into the internal parts of the Ru&s;&s;ian Empire, and &s;ome, frequently, at anchor here. Tho&s;e that &s;ail down the river carry timber, and wood of all kinds, wooden and earthen ve&s;&s;els, iron, foreign goods, and all &s;orts of corn; tho&s;e that go up the &s;tream from parts below, are laden with A&s;trachan goods, hides, tallow, and &s;alt.</P>
<P>The environs of Samara con&s;i&s;t chiefly of wa&s;te-ground and heath, ri&s;ing gradually into high hills. In the &s;now-drains that run into the Samara, are found many beautiful pebbles and flame-coloured agates, im|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="122" REF="127">
with figures, as if frozen. Many of the&s;e have been long collected and poli&s;hed, at Catherineburg.</P>
<P>The hills that lie up the river from Samara, and form it's mountainous &s;hore, are &s;o happily &s;ituated, and have &s;o fit a &s;oil, that there is no place in the whole Ru&s;&s;ian empire better adapted for trying the cultivation of vines: and &s;uch trials, if made by ex|perienced vine-dre&s;&s;ers, with &s;uch vines as love a loa|my &s;oil, mu&s;t &s;urely meet with &s;ucce&s;s. Here might al&s;o be cultivated other things, which require a warm climate, and thrive in the &s;outhern parts of Europe. But not the lea&s;t attempt has been hitherto made to introduce any thing of the kind, except pimento, and the common water-melon. The water-melon gardens are upon the heath, on both &s;ides the river, and are open to the wa&s;te. They plow the ground, &s;ow the &s;eeds, and take no farther care of them, than occa&s;io|nally to water them in dry weather, and when the fruit is ripe, leave it to be gathered by children. As they rai&s;e a great quantity of this fruit, they &s;alt and pickle it as we do cucumbers, but I don't remem|ber ever ta&s;ting any thing &s;o nau&s;eous. Some &s;tew them, and it is &s;aid, they are then very &s;weet.</P>
<P>The pimento, of which great quantities are rai&s;ed at A&s;trachan, is &s;old by the name of cod-pepper, or red-mu&s;tard. It is &s;own in the &s;ame way they &s;ow cau|liflowers, <HI>viz.</HI> in flat boxes, rai&s;ed from the ground. In
<PB N="123" REF="128">
the month of July, they remove the &s;eedling plants to beds in a garden prepared for this purpo&s;e, in rows, at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other; and water them till they &s;eem to have taken good root, and are pretty &s;trong. It &s;eldom happens, that an early fro&s;t pre|vents the ripening of this fruit. The ripe pods after being dried in an oven, are reduced to powder, &s;old at the rate of nine &s;hillings or le&s;s, for thirty-&s;ix pounds weight, and are u&s;ed by the common people as a &s;pice. Many of the&s;e pimento and water-melon plantations, are made only about the end of June, in tho&s;e hollows, where the water &s;tood all the winter, and at this &s;ea&s;on is dry, and yet their fruit ripens. They have begun here to plant apple-trees, which flouri&s;h very much about Simbur&s;ky, generally called <HI>Simbir&s;k</HI> and Syfran; but, the increa&s;e of caterpillars and other de&s;tructive in|&s;ects, is much again&s;t this u&s;eful branch of gardening.</P>
<P>Yet there are many wild fruits, apple-trees, almonds, very tall and bu&s;hy cherry-trees, <HI>(Cera&s;us pumila,)</HI> and of a very &s;picy flavour. The juice which they &s;queeze from them, is &s;old very cheap, will keep two years, and makes a regaling &s;ummer-drink; they have made a &s;ucce&s;sful attempt to tran&s;port it to Mo&s;cow, as &s;oon as the river is open. If this juice is &s;uffered to ferment, it makes an excellent, &s;picy vinegar, and if good, is as nice as the be&s;t cherry liquor. The&s;e cher|ry trees or &s;hrubs, and almond bu&s;hes, are hand&s;ome garden hedges, on account of their early bloom; and
<PB N="124" REF="129">
for a living fence, no better tree can be made choice of than the wild-apple, which is, properly &s;peaking, formed &s;o by nature. Be&s;ides, here are &s;ome remark|able and beautiful &s;hrubs, to ornament a northern gar|den, as the maple, <HI>(acer Tartaricum;)</HI> the fal&s;e a|cacia, <HI>(Robinia frute&s;cens;)</HI> the dio&s;ma, <HI>(Spirea cre|nata,)</HI> the broom, and the upright honey-&s;uckle, <HI>(Lo|nicera Tartarica.)</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above-mentioned, vernal plants, the heights about Samara produce &s;ome remarkable and curious ones, that bloom in May and June, to &s;ome of which there are no Engli&s;h names, but I have given &s;uch as mo&s;t re&s;emble them. The <HI>Ono&s;ma echioides</HI> and <HI>&s;implici&s;&s;ima;</HI> the clove July-flower, <HI>(Dianthus proli|fer;)</HI> the virgin's bower; <HI>(Clematis recta;)</HI> the &s;purge, <HI>(Euphorbia &s;egetalis;)</HI> the &s;age, <HI>(Salvia ne|mero&s;a</HI> and <HI>nutans;)</HI> the &s;age-tree, <HI>(Phlomis tubero&s;a</HI> and <HI>Herba venti;)</HI> the dragon's-head, <HI>(Dracocephalum Thymiflorum</HI> and <HI>Sibiricum;)</HI> the cat-mint, <HI>(Nepeta violacea;)</HI> the French honey-&s;uckle, <HI>(Hedy&s;arum Ono|brychis;)</HI> the milk-vetch, <HI>(A&s;tragalus pilo&s;us;)</HI> The <HI>Grandiflorus, Contortuplicatus;</HI> the Mo&s;cow and Si|berian centaury, the thi&s;tle, <HI>(Carduus cyanoides,)</HI> and the elicampane, <HI>(Inula hirta</HI> and <HI>odorata.)</HI> Among the&s;e plants, none is more known than the <HI>Ono&s;ma echi|oides,</HI> which has a long root, &s;eemingly dyed on the out&s;ide, with a beautiful red. Young maidens gather this root and paint their cheeks with it, on which ac|count
<PB N="125" REF="130">
it is called by the Ru&s;&s;ians, <HI>Rumaniza;</HI> by the Tartars, <HI>Kr&s;chab.</HI></P>
<P>Here grows al&s;o &s;pontaneou&s;ly a wild a&s;paragus, but &s;eldom &s;o large as the little finger. Though it is good to eat, the inhabitants are either ignorant or carele&s;s of this gift of nature.</P>
<P>Among the remarkable animals of the di&s;trict of Samara, the &s;quirrel, <HI>(Sciurus glis,)</HI> which they fat|ten in Italy for the table, de&s;erves to be noticed. I have found this animal in the rocky cliffs of the ea&s;tern mountains, and tried to make this and other animals which &s;leep all winter, as the Urchin and <HI>Mus citillus,</HI> &s;leep, by &s;hutting them up in an icy cave in &s;ummer|time, and &s;ucceeded, for on looking at them a few days afterwards, I found them quite in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>Of all the little animals found in the&s;e &s;teps or wa&s;tes, the mo&s;t beautiful and remarkable is the dwarf kind of hare, not larger than a rat, almo&s;t the colour, and having all the form of common hares, except the ears, which are round and &s;horter. This little creature leads a &s;olitary life in &s;pots, over&s;hadowed with bu&s;hes, where it digs holes like a rabbit, with &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages leading to them, and hides it&s;elf all the day. At twi|light it &s;teals abroad in &s;earch of food, chirps like a quail, and may be heard at night, and before dawn, at half a mile di&s;tance. The country people li&s;ten to
<PB N="126" REF="131">
the noi&s;e, but are at a lo&s;s to know from whence it comes, being wholly unacquainted with the animal. It brings forth towards the end of May, from four to &s;ix young ones, which like young rats, are blind and na|ked. In winter-time, it makes trenches in the turf, and &s;eeks it's food beneath the &s;now.</P>
<P>The mu&s;k-rat, <HI>(Sorex mo&s;chatus,)</HI> is another uncom|mon animal, &s;een frequently on the river Samara, and the lakes. It is generally caught in tho&s;e ba&s;ket-tools fixed in the river for catching of fi&s;h, and is commonly found &s;uffocated, tho' it's internal parts are formed for living on the water. This animal makes it's ne&s;t in holes, under water, in the banks of the lakes, but as they work the hole upwards, the further end is above the level of the water, and of cour&s;e, lies dry. In winter, it has no air but what it receives below the ice. As &s;oon as this begins to melt, it is often &s;een playing on the &s;urface, and ba&s;king in the &s;un. It has a very &s;en&s;ible and flexible &s;nout, which it can turn into it's mouth, and with which it digs up worms and leeches in mar&s;hy grounds, on which it feeds, muddling in water, like a duck. It's eyes are &s;maller than the mole's; if provoked, it &s;queaks like a mou&s;e, and bites dan|gerou&s;ly. It's entrails when fre&s;h, have a &s;trong, &s;ul|phureous &s;mell, but the mu&s;ky &s;cent which proceeds from it's glands, beneath the &s;caly &s;kin of it's tail, is more powerful, than that of mu&s;k it&s;elf. <HI>Linnoeus</HI> has
<PB N="127" REF="132">
cla&s;&s;ed this animal in the genus of beavers; but, ac|cording to it's marks, it is a true &s;orex.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t ea&s;ily be conceived, that &s;o warm a di&s;trict as Samara is, in the &s;ummer, mu&s;t &s;warm with in&s;ects. The common grey and green lizards are here in &s;uch quantities, that &s;trike a bu&s;h, and you will drive out numbers; they bury in the ground under high gra&s;s, and their holes have two entrances to each.</P>
<P>Among the in&s;ects, I took notice of an uncommon large tarantula, with which the environs of Samara &s;warm. The&s;e in&s;ects will make holes two feet perpen|dicularly in the &s;olid ground, where they lie all day, and never quit them till night, when they &s;eek their prey. Though this in&s;ect very much re&s;embles the Apulian tarantula, I never heard of any ill-effects from it's bite, and yet the pea&s;ant's children, frequently digging them from their holes, to draw a kind of thread out of their &s;kin, are frequently bitten. I was once bit my|&s;elf, and a Ca&s;anian whom I employed to look for &s;ome, was bit till he bled, the wound &s;welled, and was pain|ful for two or three days, but this was all.</P>
<P>Spani&s;h flies are here caught in quantities during the month of May, and &s;upply all the apothecaries &s;hops in this country. Indeed, this di&s;trict is very rich in curious in&s;ects, and I never &s;aw any, where &s;o many of the lice-kind called, <HI>acarus reduvius,</HI> and <HI>ricinus;</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="133">
the bu&s;hes about Samara are full of them, and one cannot go into the fields, without having one's cloaths covered with them.</P>
<P>Among the remarkable things in the di&s;trict of Sa|mara, I mu&s;t notice the bones of elephants and buffa|los, that are often fi&s;hed out of the river, or found up|on it's banks. I met with a buffalo horn, which, in|dependant of the broken point and lower part, weighed upwards of &s;ix pounds, and it's greate&s;t diameter was four Paris inches.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 1. <HI>Schelechmet.</HI> The &s;pring being now very favourable, I pur&s;ued my way at the end of April, to Sy&s;ran, about &s;ixty miles di&s;tant. In my way there, I pa&s;&s;ed through the Mordvine village Schelechmet, where I was pre&s;ent at a nuptial ceremony, the mo&s;t re|markable parts of which were as follow. As &s;oon as the bride returned from the church where &s;he was mar|ried, and from which &s;he was brought back in a wag|gon, (with the bridemaid by her &s;ide;) and, over which a large, white linen &s;heet was &s;pread; &s;he was ta|ken by two friends of the bridegroom, and conducted howling, to the door of the bridegroom's hou&s;e, where &s;he was greeted by all the neighbouring females. Af|terwards came her mother, with a round-bottomed pan full of dryed hops, which, &s;etting fire to with a match, &s;he placed at her daughter's right foot, and which the bride was immediately to kick away. This is done
<PB N="129" REF="134">
three times. Each time the pan was filled with fre&s;h hops and fired. When &s;he kicks the pan from her, they attend particularly to the manner in which the pan is overturned, as, if it tumbles one way, it is con&s;idered as portentive of dire di&s;a&s;ters to the young couple, if it falls another, as ominous of future happine&s;s. It reeled about and &s;ettled with the hollow &s;ide up|wards. This is a token of good-luck, and gave joy to the whole company, who were pretty well intoxica|ted, and called loudly for more beer, which was brought them in a cup, into which the bride threw &s;ome neat rings, (many of which &s;he had upon her fingers,) and before &s;he was &s;uffered to enter the hou&s;e. This delayed much the &s;ucceeding ceremo|nies, which I did not think worth while to wait for. But I was told, that prior to this, a &s;poonful of thick &s;tir-about, made of oatmeal, was to be di&s;tributed to each inhabitant of the village, given them either in their hats, or on a corner of their coats, as mo&s;t agree|able to the receiver.</P>
<P><HI>Walofka,</HI> 15 <HI>miles from Samara.</HI> At a village called Walofka, about fifteen miles from Samara, is an ex|ten&s;ive, Tartarian fortre&s;s, near half a mile in circum|ference, with a treble ditch and bank; but, there are no buildings on it, nor any ve&s;tiges of buildings, but in ploughing the fields adjoining, Tartarian bricks are often found; perhaps, the remains of &s;ome hidden graves.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="135">The great road to Syfran, is over &s;ome high and open hills, but under a &s;pecies of cultivation. Their method of hu&s;bandry, may appear odd to a &s;tranger; but what I relate, I &s;aw. The countryman &s;ows his oats, millet and rye, on a &s;pot of wild, lay land, which he conceives not to want manure, as if he de&s;tined it to be eaten by birds. He then plows it, and another hor&s;e following with a harrow, but without a driver, compleats the work. Thus, one field after the other, is &s;owed, ploughed, and harrowed, by a &s;ingle man, and two hor&s;es. In &s;owing wheat and barley they take a little more pains, this being their fe&s;tival food, (for they brew their beer with malt, as we do,) and indeed it would not thrive by &s;uch a mode of hu&s;bandry. If the field is very di&s;tant from the village, the hu&s;band|man takes his provi&s;ions with him, and continues day and night upon the ground, till his land is all &s;own, or he is called home, by the &s;olemnity of his &s;abbath. On the&s;e hills is &s;een a kind of mou&s;e, <HI>(Mus talpinus,)</HI> that lives on certain roots, which it &s;eeks, by throwing up the ground that covers them.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 5. On the fifth of May, I went to &s;ee the wonderful, rocky &s;hore of the Wolga, in the neigh|bourhood of Ko&s;tyt&s;chi. This village, con&s;i&s;ting of obout 300 hou&s;es, and a wooden church, is erected on the &s;teep and rocky banks of this river, between fifty and &s;ixty feet higher than the water. The wall of the river is near a mile in length, and is formed of a
<PB N="131" REF="136">
yellowi&s;h lime-&s;tone, in which are a number of cavi|ties and natural grottos, from twenty to thirty feet deep, producing a very beautiful effect. The&s;e ex|cavations can be a&s;cribed only to the da&s;hing waves of the Wolga, which wa&s;h away the earthy layers, and excavate the &s;tone it&s;elf. Higher up, this rock &s;trikes the beholder with the idea of a dreadful ruin. The cliffs are inhabited by ring-doves, crows, and little birds of prey, which do not quit their &s;ituation even in winter. I found here a beautiful kind of water-wag-tail, <HI>(Motacilla Leucomela,)</HI> no where to be met with but in this rock, building it's ne&s;t in the cliffs. In the water-drains near this village, is found a great deal of &s;alt-petre.</P>
<P>The &s;tone of this rock is penetrated very generally with &s;omething like a pitchy &s;ub&s;tance, which is cer|tainly brought here by the water in a fluid &s;tate, and &s;ettled; it is black and &s;hining, and taken out in pieces that weigh many pounds. It is very brittle and crumbling, but of an inflammable nature, and will burn in the candle like &s;ealing-wax. Indeed, by an ad|dition which takes away the roughne&s;s, a beautiful &s;ealing-wax is made, and I was informed, that a mer|chant who formerly lived there, obtained an Imperial grant to manufacture &s;ealing-wax from it. I was told al&s;o at Samara, that this jet, with &s;ome other dug at Tetju&s;chi, was formerly conveyed to the &s;ulphur manu|factory at Sernoi Gorodok, where they pre&s;&s;ed from it
<PB N="132" REF="137">
an oil, u&s;ed in the artillery. At pre&s;ent, this mineral is applied to no other u&s;e, than for &s;miths to blacken or lacquer their iron wares.</P>
<P><HI>Sy&s;ran, May</HI> 5. I reached Sy&s;ran on the fifth of May at night. The greate&s;t part of this town is de|lightfully &s;ituated on a height, which occupies the northern angle, between the rivers Krym&s;a and Sy&s;ran|ka, into which latter the former flows. A &s;mall part of the town, together with a well-built cloi&s;ter, lies on the &s;outhern bank of the Sy&s;ranka; the re&s;t, which is meanly built, lies on a flat, along the Krym&s;a. Here is a decayed wooden fortre&s;s, a &s;tone-built church, and a court-hou&s;e; but, as the place is not well &s;up|plied, few of the inhabitants are rich. They apply them&s;elves a good deal to gardening, and have many orchards of apples. They breed a good deal of poul|try, and with the&s;e the A&s;tracan &s;wan-goo&s;e. This bird intermixes with the common goo&s;e, and it's pro|geny will couple with them&s;elves; of cour&s;e, the breed is mixed. The pure ba&s;tards partake of the nature of both the &s;wan-goo&s;e, and common goo&s;e, as to &s;ize, &s;hape, and colour, and mixing further with common gee&s;e, the young ones are of a blacki&s;h hue. All their bills are red, and bent, and have &s;ometimes a little prominence at the upper end.</P>
<P><HI>Ka&s;chpur,</HI> 7 <HI>miles from Sy&s;ran.</HI> The borough-town of Ka&s;chpur, through which I pa&s;&s;ed, is &s;ituated on a
<PB N="133" REF="138">
high hill, upon an arm of the Wolga. This hill forms part of the Wolga's left &s;hore. It is one of the mo&s;t ancient Ru&s;&s;ian habitations of this di&s;trict, and as far as is known, was built before Sy&s;ran. It has three churches, and belongs to the chancery of Sy&s;ranka. At the &s;outh end of this town are &s;till remaining, four decayed towers of the old fortre&s;s, and at &s;ome little di&s;tance there is a watch-tower. In the middle of this town, which lies open and &s;cattered, ri&s;es a very high chalk hill, in form of a &s;ugar loaf, which can be &s;een at a great di&s;tance. About this hill are &s;ome old dung|hills, mouldered into a rich, black &s;oil, which by the addition of chalk, produces a great deal of &s;alt-petre. I found whole tracts &s;o wholly chry&s;tali&s;ed with it, that it looked on the ground like &s;now, and I could have gathered it in handfuls. Indeed, all the land round this place is &s;o full of &s;alt-petre, that the cattle eat the very earth. Coal is al&s;o dug in this neighbour|hood.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 10. I intended to leave Sy&s;ran on the 9th, but not being able to get hor&s;es, on account of a fe&s;tival on that day, kept in commemoration of <HI>St. Nicolas,</HI> I delayed my departure till the next day at noon. The heat was in&s;upportable, but the flying clouds &s;eemed to promi&s;e us &s;ome refre&s;hing &s;howers. The air was like a furnace, and the heat &s;o inten&s;e, that the mer|cury in the thermometer &s;tood in the mo&s;t airy and &s;hady place at 105; on the 12th of May, it fell to
<PB N="134" REF="139">
93 degrees, and often in the &s;un to 85 degrees, a heat &s;o great, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to continue a minute in the &s;un-&s;hine. All nature was languid and panting, the &s;oil on the black heath cracked above an ell deep, and the apertures were &s;ome inches wide. I left Sy&s;|ran about five in the evening, for it was too &s;ultry to travel in the day; and, the great &s;warms of ox-flies, <HI>(Tabanus bovinus</HI> and <HI>tropicus,)</HI> were very trouble&s;ome and tormenting to the hor&s;es, while the &s;un was near the meridian. But, in this &s;corching weather, I took notice, that among the bu&s;hes on the wilds, bloomed the common piony, the fragrant and white dittany, and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>I was detained at the next village by a melancholy circum&s;tance; a gun that had been loaded to &s;hoot wild-gee&s;e, accidentally went off, and &s;hot my Ger|man &s;ervant in the hip, &s;hattering it very much; hu|manity therefore required, as he was mortally wound|ed, that I &s;hould convey him to a place, where he could have &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and as Stawropal was not a great way off, I &s;ent him there by water upon the U&s;&s;a, and continued my route without him.</P>
<P>At U&s;&s;olie, at the bottom of a mountain, is a con|&s;iderable &s;alt-well, which makes this di&s;trict intere&s;ting. The &s;pot where the well &s;tands, is now overflown with water, by an adjoining river, but there is &s;till to be &s;een &s;ome remains of the old works, by which the &s;alt-water
<PB N="135" REF="140">
was conveyed into pits. The principal people of this town, in who&s;e juri&s;diction this well is, ordered it to be filled up with rubbi&s;h, but the water has puz|zled it's way out again, in &s;everal, little veins betwixt the &s;tones, and depo&s;es a whiti&s;h, &s;ulphureous &s;ediment. This water has a nitrous appearance, and a &s;trong, &s;ul|phureous &s;mell. There are one or two more of the&s;e wells, at a little di&s;tance from the fir&s;t, and certainly i&s;|&s;uing from the &s;ame mountain.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of our journey onward, we pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome bare hills, where a great number of marmots were every where &s;een &s;itting, at the entrance of their habi|tations or holes, hi&s;&s;ing, as if they meant to in&s;ult the pa&s;&s;engers as they rode by. When we came to the vil|lage Scwrjukowa, which takes it's name, (as is often cu&s;tomary among the Tartars, and people of T&s;chu|wa,) from him who erected for him&s;elf the fir&s;t dwel|ling there, and is now inhabited by the unconverted people of T&s;chuwa; the pea&s;ants were preparing a great &s;acrifice for the next day, to &s;olicit heaven in their way, for a fertile rain. On account of our arri|val it was po&s;tponed, and however de&s;irous I was to be pre&s;ent at &s;uch a &s;olemnity, I did not find my&s;elf di&s;|po&s;ed to urge them to a compliance, contrary to their inclinations.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 23d. On the 23d of May, I returned to Sa|mara, and Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Falk</HI> with me. His de&s;ign was to
<PB N="136" REF="141">
have taken another route, but not finding him&s;elf well, he thought &s;topping at Samara for a few days might recover him. I mu&s;t not omit mentioning here, the <HI>Gyp&s;ophila panicula,</HI> which was now in bloom. This plant grows upon the heaths, and towards autumn, when it begins to fade, forms it&s;elf into a round ball, which is often broke from the &s;tem by a gu&s;t of wind, and rolling over the wa&s;te, often frightens the hor&s;es of travellers.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Samara is a place, to which the &s;ulphur works have been removed from the di&s;|trict of Sergie&s;k, and con&s;i&s;ted of the manufactory, a wooden compting-hou&s;e, and about forty dwelling-hou&s;es, &s;pread out in form of a &s;treet, along the high &s;hore of the Wolga, in which dwelt the workmen; but, as the&s;e works have been di&s;continued, and the workmen are removed, only twelve huts are remaining. This &s;ulphur manufactory was &s;ubject to the Woiwods or magi&s;trates at Samara, till the year 1720, when it was granted to major Iwan Molo&s;tof, who was the pro|prietor to 1757, when the whole was granted to one Iwan Martof, a merchant of Peter&s;burgh, who&s;e &s;on cea&s;ed working them for five years, and then de&s;erted them. In this manufactory, twenty-two &s;uperinten|dants, and 576 workmen, chiefly from Sergie&s;sk, were employed. The&s;e men relieved each other every month, &s;o that about 130 worked at one time. The annual produce of this manufactory was full 60,000lb.
<PB N="137" REF="142">
of brim&s;tone, and might ea&s;ily have been increa&s;ed to 80,000lb. Thirty-&s;ix pounds weight &s;tands the proprie|tor in from fifty to eighty copeks, (100 copeks are in value 4s. 6d. Engli&s;h,) and conveying it to Mo&s;cow in winter, with hired hor&s;es, co&s;ts him twelve copeks for 36lb.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of this &s;ulphur-manufactory to the &s;tate, cannot be enough lamented; for, as there is plenty of fire-wood in the place, was it properly conducted, it might turn out to advantage. The buildings of the pre&s;ent works, are a melting and refining-hou&s;e. The melting-hou&s;e is about 350 feet long, and contained 51 brick furnaces, &s;ome of which now are in ruins. The brim&s;tone ore being fir&s;t brui&s;ed, is melted in the&s;e furnaces in earthen pots, from which the pure &s;ulphur is &s;uffered to run into receiving-ve&s;&s;els below, placed in wooden troughs, filled with water. In order to re|fine it, it is melted again in ovens, and afterwards pour|ed into moulds, &s;tanding in a trough of water. When this manufactory was fir&s;t &s;et on foot, the furnaces had no chimnies, the con&s;equence of which was, that many of the workmen died of &s;low fevers and con|&s;umptions; but this is not the ca&s;e now.</P>
<P>The famous mountain, in which &s;ulphur is found in ma&s;&s;es, ri&s;es almo&s;t perpendicularly from the &s;hore of the Wolga, oppo&s;ite the mouth of the river Sok or Soka, to a height of 700 feet. The lime-mountains near it are
<PB N="138" REF="143">
&s;till higher, and the valley between them is covered with wood, with villages inter&s;per&s;ed. The cold in this valley is uncommonly great, even in &s;ummer|time, which induces the fi&s;hermen, who are employed on the river Wolga, to lodge here at night, in order to avoid the flies, which dare not venture into this cold air. I have been told by &s;ome Ca&s;anians of Gur|jef, that going from the mouth of the river Yaik, (or Jaik, for the jod <HI>J</HI> in Ru&s;&s;ia, is pronounced like a <HI>Y,)</HI> along the coa&s;t of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea to A&s;trabal, there is, at a place called Pri&s;tan, between Tukkaragan and Tjutkaragan, a deep valley between the mountains, where the&s;e very Ca&s;anians, who were &s;ent from on board to fetch water, could not, on account of the in|&s;upportable cold, &s;tand it, but were obliged to return to their &s;hip, without their errand.</P>
<P>In order to a&s;cend this &s;ulphureous mountain, which is covered with under-wood, I was in many places obliged to creep upon my knees, no path having been cleared away; and it was &s;o exceedingly &s;teep, that I was often forced to climb my way. It is inconceiva|ble, that after working many years here, the people have not opened a hor&s;e-way, and rendered the path up it ea&s;y, by gentle windings. In which ca&s;e, they might bring the &s;ulphur down on hor&s;es; whereas, it is now attended with a great deal of labour, the men carrying down the &s;tone in ma&s;&s;es of 100 pounds weight, upon their &s;houlders. And yet, though the
<PB N="139" REF="144">
way up and down is &s;teep and rocky, and dangerous to a per&s;on pa&s;&s;ing it, without a load, I did not hear of any accident happening to the men. The &s;ulphur in this mountain lies very deep. There is one opening on the top above 70 feet wide, and upwards of 40 feet deep. They have worked ten years in this pit, and the &s;ulphur vein does not &s;eem near exhau&s;ted. Other parts of the mountain con&s;i&s;t of lime-&s;tone, &s;tucco, and Mu&s;covy talc. There are &s;prings on it uncom|monly &s;ulphureous, but clear, and ice and &s;now dwell here the whole year. Of the under-wood growing on it, I &s;aw, the Ru&s;&s;ian plane-tree, the buck-thorn, <HI>(Rhamnus catharticus</HI> and <HI>Alpinus,)</HI> and the following plants; the hellebore, <HI>(Helleborine,)</HI> in quantities; the lady's &s;lipper, <HI>(calceolus;)</HI> the wind-flower, <HI>(Centaurea Mo&s;chata;</HI> the la&s;erwort, <HI>(La&s;erpitium trilobum;)</HI> the agaric, <HI>(Amanta cervaria;)</HI> the chichling vetch, <HI>(La|thyris;)</HI> and the vetch, <HI>(vicia pi&s;iformis;)</HI> and, al&s;o the &s;tock gilly-flower, <HI>(Cheiranthus ery&s;imoides.)</HI> Upon the latter were great &s;warms of beautiful in&s;ects, and butterflies. The &s;talks of the <HI>Cervaria</HI> &s;ent forth here a &s;weet, aromatic gum, that melted in the mouth, which they did not do in any other part of the heath.</P>
<P><HI>Samara, May</HI> 30. The weather was now warm, and the ox-fly very trouble&s;ome. Here were &s;uch &s;warms al&s;o of a kind of gnat, that often darkened the &s;ky, and bit us &s;o deep, as to leave the wounds bleeding. The inhabitants have no other method of defending
<PB N="140" REF="145">
their faces from this pernicious in&s;ect, than by drawing over their head a large net-cap, &s;oaked in birch-oil. Every per&s;on that goes out of town, provides him&s;elf with &s;uch a cap. Though this in&s;ect bites till the blood runs, it happily gives no pain. On cattle and on birds, it gets in among the hair and feathers, and runs about like a lou&s;e. This in&s;ect, called the <HI>Mo&s;|kara,</HI> leaves them about the end of June; but, ano|ther very trouble&s;ome one comes in it's room; this is a kind of wa&s;p, almo&s;t invi&s;ible, <HI>(tipula &s;ol&s;titialis,)</HI> which does not &s;ting, but flys about in &s;uch &s;warms, that a per&s;on cannot &s;tand &s;till a moment, without having his mouth, no&s;e and eyes full of them. They call this in&s;ect <HI>Kochra,</HI> and defend them&s;elves from it by large nets, grea&s;ed with hog's-lard. Here al&s;o grows, in bu&s;hy places, the campion, <HI>(Lychnis Chalcedo|nica,)</HI> which the common people call cuckow-&s;oap, and u&s;e it to wa&s;h their hands and linen.</P>
<P>I &s;ent part of my attendants on before me with the heavy baggage, from Samara acro&s;s the Kalmuc wa&s;tes to the river Jaik, &s;topping to take a further view of this di&s;trict my&s;elf, before I left it. I followed them however, on the 11th of June, but before I had got half way to the place I ordered them to, a new acci|dent interrupted my progre&s;s. The waggon, in which &s;ome per&s;ons I had taken as companions, rode, was overthrown from a height, and two of my people were hurt; one was exceedingly brui&s;ed on the hip, and my
<PB N="141" REF="146">
waggoner had his right hand &s;hattered. I &s;ent the&s;e men back to Samara, and proceeded with the re&s;t to Orenburg, pa&s;&s;ing through Alexieffkoi, inhabited by invalid &s;oldiers and Ca&s;anian trade&s;men and farmers. From this place to the town of Ka&s;akian, the road lies &s;traight, but there are no regular way-hou&s;es for ac|commodation, a few cottages only excepted, &s;cattered here and there, but where we could get hay and wa|ter. The &s;ummer-road to Orenburg from Alexieffkoi, is over the hilly or left &s;ide of the river Samara; but in winter, between the Samara and Kinel, through al|ternate vallies and hills, for the &s;pace of &s;eventy miles. I went the winter-road, and fancy can &s;carce paint a prettier di&s;trict; the mo&s;t beautiful woods of a&s;ps and birch, relieved, by turns, with green hills and luxuri|ant meadows. No country &s;urely de&s;erves cultivation more than along the river Samara, there being plenty of arable land, no want of wood, and great extent of very rich and beautiful meadow. Here are a great many wild roe-deer without tails, <HI>(Cervus pygargus,)</HI> and elks which rove about, as far as the river Samara.</P>
<P>The elk in winter, mo&s;tly feeds on the young twigs and the bark of the a&s;p and poplar-trees, but in &s;um|mer-time, &s;eeks it's protection and nouri&s;hment in the &s;teps or uninhabited wa&s;tes. The roe is more found on the hilly di&s;tricts, the wind carrying off the &s;now quicker in winter, than in the low-grounds, and thus giving it an opportunity to feed more plentifully. The
<PB N="142" REF="147">
Co&s;&s;acks kill a great deal of this game, and the chief &s;ea&s;on of hunting it is in March, the &s;un then having &s;ufficient power to melt the &s;urface of the &s;now into a cru&s;t, on which they can more readily come up with them in their &s;now-&s;cates, a contrivance u&s;ed by the Lap|landers al&s;o; whereas, the feet of the&s;e animals break through the &s;now as they run, and are thereby impeded in their cour&s;e. They are tracked and driven into val|lies, where the &s;now lies many feet deep, and are thus brought within reach of a gun, or are more clo&s;ely pur&s;ued and killed with a lance. The roe, being a tender-footed animal, cannot run far; but the elk, which is hunted by dogs, will often kill a dog by a kick. The roe-buck throws off his heavy horns in November after rutting time, and gets new ones in &s;pring. The female roe, commonly brings forth two young ones about the month of April; her horns are nearly like tho&s;e of the buck, only more grown in &s;pring, but are yet rough and &s;oft. Their &s;kins are &s;old very cheap. The &s;kin of the elk is worth about 4s. 6d. and their meat fetches but a low price.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above animals, they have, farther along the Samara, great plenty of very fine ermines, and a middle-&s;ized marten, with a bright, yellow neck. There are al&s;o upon the &s;teps or wilds, &s;ome few bea|vers or otters, as al&s;o foxes, and tho&s;e Co&s;&s;acks who are fond of hunting, will, in autumn, lie for &s;ome time abroad on the&s;e &s;teps, to watch for them. Foxes are
<PB N="143" REF="148">
le&s;s valuable, the further &s;outh they are found up the Samara, till they degenerate into tho&s;e grey, &s;tep foxes, which the Kirgui&s;ians bring here to barter or truck with the Kalmucks. The &s;quirrel is rarely &s;een here; but is much &s;ought after, on account of it's fur, which is of a whiti&s;h colour.</P>
<P>The country along the river Kinel, is plea&s;ant and varied. The large village T&s;chera&s;k, has been built &s;ince the year 1744, by a colony from Little Ru&s;&s;ia, who had formerly erected many dwelling places on &s;pots about the boundary, at the river Jaik, but were often plundered by Kirgui&s;ian robbers. The inhabitants of this new flouri&s;hing place, live after their own country fa&s;hion; they have neat hou&s;es with chimnies, good ovens, apply them&s;elves chiefly to the cultivati|on of tobacco and breeding of cattle, and live in abundant &s;prightline&s;s and freedom. They are go|verned by an officer cho&s;en from among them&s;elves, and confirmed by the regency of Stawropal, whom they call <HI>Ataman,</HI> and who has an a&s;&s;i&s;tant under him, called <HI>Je&s;&s;aul.</HI> Their dre&s;s is like that of the Ko&s;&s;acks or Polanders. The women wear nothing in &s;ummer but a &s;hirt, worked in the neck with needle-work, and in&s;tead of a petticoat, they wear round the wai&s;t, a piece of calimanco, plaided with various colours, and wo|ven by them&s;elves, very much like the Scotch plaid. They wear on the head &s;mall caps of varied coloured &s;tuff, bound on with &s;trings, who&s;e ends are worked
<PB N="144" REF="149">
with the needle, and hang down behind. Girls let not their hair hang down as do the Ru&s;&s;ians, but braid it into tre&s;&s;es, wind it round their heads, and bind it in front with a party-coloured band, ornamented with co|ral beads, &amp;c. Their method of courting, is not ex|actly like that of the highlanders of Frie&s;land, but ve|ry &s;imilar to it, and they have many ceremonies &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Tartars. A court&s;hip continues about two years, during the fir&s;t year of which, the young man is not &s;uffered even to touch his &s;weetheart. On the day of marriage, a kind of flag is carried after the bride on her return from church, made of black or red &s;tuff, as the bridegroom &s;hall think proper, and which he makes choice of, to acquaint the world with her conduct, it being a &s;ignal to &s;ay, whether &s;he has acted to his liking or not, during the la&s;t year of their court&s;hip, when he is entitled to take more liberties.</P>
<P>For the purpo&s;e of &s;heltering and feeding their cattle, they erect &s;heds or &s;talls here and there, on the wa&s;tes. Their chief breed is horned cattle, and they generally plough their land with oxen, though many of the farmers po&s;&s;e&s;s from twenty to thirty hor&s;es. Their flocks of &s;heep are numerous. Many keep to to the number of four hundred, but they do not con|&s;ider their wool as the be&s;t, it being rather long and coar&s;e. They do not &s;uffer the ram to be with the ewes till after St. Peter's-day, which in the Ru&s;&s;ian Ca|lendar is at the end of June, a good cu&s;tom to prevent
<PB N="145" REF="150">
the lambs being dropped too early. They are careful to keep their cattle clean, and &s;pread hay beneath the &s;heep in &s;talls, to prevent any injury to the wool, which will fetch twelve or thirteen &s;hillings a pud, that is 36lb. They never have any murrain among their cat|tle; the only di&s;temper is a kind of itch, which they cure with tobacco water, and as a remedy for maggots in &s;heep, they u&s;e the agrimony.</P>
<P>The cultivation of tobacco is the employment of the women; who &s;ow al&s;o large quantities of vegeta|bles for their own u&s;e. But, want of rain this year, had de&s;troyed not only their garden-&s;tuff, but all &s;orts of corn.</P>
<P>From the middle of June to the middle of July, women and children are bu&s;ied before harve&s;t, in ga|thering that kind of cochineal, called <HI>Coccus Polonicus.</HI> They find this in&s;ect chiefly on dry, barren &s;oils, about the root of the common &s;trawberry and the cinque-foil, <HI>(Potentilla reptans.)</HI> In Little Ru&s;&s;ia, they are &s;aid to collect them from a plant called <HI>Smolka,</HI> which, accord|ing to the common opinion, is the St. John's wort. They cut out the&s;e plants with a knife, and open the little, blue bli&s;ters which hang on the uppermo&s;t part of the plant, in which, the in&s;ect is &s;aid to be contained. There are two or three &s;uch bli&s;ters on a plant. The in&s;ect comes to perfection, &s;ooner or later in the month of June; and in July, creeps out. This plant is well
<PB N="146" REF="151">
known to the women. But they prefer the in&s;ect when it is ju&s;t ready to leave the plant, in preference to tho&s;e in a le&s;s perfect &s;tate, as it yields a better and a bright|er colour. There is a &s;aying among them, that all the eloped in&s;ects of a whole di&s;trict, a&s;&s;emble them|&s;elves on one bu&s;h, on a certain day, and that tho&s;e who go out earlie&s;t in the morning, on the Ca&s;anian fea&s;t-day, (June 8th,) will &s;urely meet with them. The cochineal when gathered, is cleared, through a &s;ieve, from the earth that hangs about it, dried in a pan over a &s;low fire or in an oven, and then put away in &s;ome dry place. Owing to the great trouble in col|lecting them, they never &s;earch for more than they want for their own u&s;e, in order to dye their girdles or &s;ome woollen yarn, which they u&s;e as an ornament to their dre&s;s. They &s;oak this yarn twenty-four hours in a very &s;our decoction, in which allum is mixed, letting it &s;tand all this time in an oven; after this, it is wrung and dyed. This done, the cochineal is brui&s;ed in a pot, boiled up with water, and when all the co|lour is extracted, it is &s;trained, and the yarn boiled in it. With one handful of cochineal, they dye about a pound weight of wool; but this colour does not look better than that prepared from the marjoram, <HI>(Origa|num;)</HI> it is preferred only, becau&s;e it fades le&s;s.</P>
<P>In this high and wild country, there are Marmotes in plenty, many bears, inhabiting the bu&s;hy vales, bu&s;|tards and cranes, and in the rivers, tortoi&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="152">On the boundary of Samara there are &s;everal forts, each garri&s;oned with about thirty invalids, and inhabi|ted by Co&s;&s;acks, with &s;ome pieces of iron ordnance. At one of the forts, that of Bu&s;uluzkaja, &s;ituated near the brook of the &s;ame name, the commanding-officer of the line or boundary has a very good hou&s;e, and the hou&s;es of the Co&s;&s;acks and &s;oldiers, form four cro&s;s &s;treets, as they do in the other forts, the church, &s;tand|ing in the center, in a kind of &s;quare. Among the Co&s;&s;acks here &s;ettled are many Tartars, who hunt the mountains and de&s;arts, and kill wild hor&s;es for food. The&s;e are not the natural produce of the country, but the progeny of &s;ome tame hor&s;es that have run away from their owners. They perfectly re&s;emble the hor&s;es of Little Ru&s;&s;ia, except, that their heads are thicker, the ears more pointed, and the no&s;e &s;hort, up&s;tanding manes, and &s;hort tails. The mo&s;t common colour is a fallow brown; though there are &s;ome grey, and &s;ome of a deep brown, but no pie-bald or black. They go about in herds from five to twenty, con&s;i&s;ting of mares, colts, and one &s;tallion. When the &s;tallion-colts grow big, the old hor&s;e drives them from the herd, and they are &s;een to follow the herd at a di&s;tance, till they are old and &s;trong enough to become the &s;ire of a herd them&s;elves. They are &s;aid to &s;cent a man at the di&s;|tance of near a mile, if the wind &s;ets in their favour, and will fly from their pur&s;uer; but, in &s;ummer-time, when they are tormented by the flies, they are ea&s;ily caught. They catch wild &s;tallions by leading out a
<PB N="148" REF="153">
mare, which entices them within &s;hot. In the fort where I was, they had a wild colt, but he being too fierce to be broke in, they got rid of him. He &s;eemed to me to have uncommon &s;trength.</P>
<P>There were formerly in this di&s;trict, a great many beavers, otters, and wild-boars; but they have been extirpated by the Co&s;&s;acks, who are great hunters. Badgers there are in plenty, bears and elks. La&s;t &s;pring, the country was over-run with antilopes, though this animal had not been &s;een here for many years before. The dryne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on having brought them here in large herds or flocks, from the &s;outhern parts. They ventured even into the low grounds, and meadows. As this animal ca&s;ts it's young in the be|ginning of May, we &s;aw &s;ome young ones, and, like lambs, found they were &s;carce able to walk for &s;ome days after they were dropped. Some of the&s;e have been taken, brought up with milk, and rendered &s;o tame, as to follow their owner about like a dog, an&s;wer to a name, and &s;wim through waters after him. As they grow older, they will &s;earch for their food near the hou&s;e where they have been fed, and if &s;uffered to go at large, will not wander far from the village, but re|turn at night. I could not have believed this, had I not been an eye-witne&s;s of the fact. The&s;e tame-bred antilopes, which re&s;emble a &s;he-goat, are not in the lea&s;t afraid of dogs, nor will dogs mole&s;t them, any more than other dome&s;tic animals. Their fle&s;h, if not
<PB N="149" REF="154">
above one year old, would be preferable to that of the roe, if it did not &s;mell &s;o &s;trong of wormwood, which is their favourite food; yet this &s;cent, when the meat is roa&s;ted and cold, goes off. The old ones are very di&s;gu&s;tful, on account of their backs being covered with &s;ores, ari&s;ing from maggots, almo&s;t as thick as one's finger, depo&s;ited in their &s;kin in an embryo &s;tate, by a peculiar &s;pecies of fly; <HI>(Oe&s;trus antilopum,)</HI> &s;o that there is &s;carce a &s;pot to be found on their backs, which is not infected.</P>
<P>The mountains in this di&s;trict are frequented by abundance of eagles and other birds of prey; I &s;aw here the yellow-headed, black eagle. The country people will often take the eagles from their ne&s;ts, built on high trees, bring them up and &s;ell them to the Kir|gui&s;ians, at a very good price. Here is al&s;o a very rare bird, <HI>(Pratincola</HI> Cram.) which feeds upon gra&s;s-hop|pers, and other in&s;ects. When they &s;oar, they make a &s;hrilling noi&s;e. Some have ridiculou&s;ly thought this bird a &s;pecies of &s;wallow, but there is in reality no pre|tence for this. His bill is like that of the cuckow, he has a white &s;tripe from the eye about the throat, and his flight and flying features, are like tho&s;e of the &s;ea-&s;wallow, <HI>(Sterna,)</HI> but his feet like that of the curlew.</P>
<P>Here are many tumuli throughout this country, but not rai&s;ed very high above the ground. Some Co&s;|&s;acks, who make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to open the&s;e graves,
<PB N="150" REF="155">
a&s;&s;ured me, they found &s;ome uncommonly large hu|man bones in them; for example, a &s;hin-bone, that; &s;et up again&s;t the leg of a full-grown per&s;on, reached higher than the knee. It is &s;aid, that a Kalmuck once out on a &s;hooting party, found, laying in one of the&s;e tumuli, a tran&s;parent well-poli&s;hed &s;tone &s;et in &s;ilver, which was &s;old by a third per&s;on, into who&s;e hands it fell, for above 100 rubles, each ruble 4s. 6d. Engli&s;h. All the arrows, arms, and other in&s;truments, found in the&s;e graves, are made of copper. Sometimes they find gold, and one of the Co&s;&s;acks of Tozkaja, found upon a corp&s;e a few years &s;ince, a golden neck-ring.</P>
<P>Sorot&s;chin&s;kaja, is, of all the forts erected on the Samarian line or boundary, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and be&s;t inhabited. It has a ditch, and a brea&s;t-work with chevaux-de-frize in a regular form, with &s;ome wood|en towers. Be&s;ides many good hou&s;es belonging to the Co&s;&s;acks, the commanding officer has a hotel, and here is al&s;o a court-hou&s;e. The commander-in-chief of the whole Samarian line, dwelt here formerly. The&s;e la&s;t two buildings, and a wooden church, &s;tand in the &s;quare and open part of the fort, and here is a good bridge built over the Samara. The river is very incon&s;iderable, and is &s;o &s;hallow and &s;erpentine, that it is &s;carcely conceivable how barges could come up to this fortre&s;s from Orenburg; and that they did is inconte&s;tible, from the many anchors found here.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="156">In my way on, at one of the redoubts, I was told, I had pa&s;&s;ed a tumulus recently opened, on which there &s;tood erected a &s;tone, having the face of a man cut on it, and another lying, with the &s;hape of a man en|graved on it. This intelligence excited my curio&s;ity, and made me de&s;irous of examining further into it. I therefore procured a number of workmen with proper tools, and went to this place, at the di&s;tance of 19 miles, on the 20th of June.</P>
<P>The opened tumulus on which the &s;tones had lain, is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable ones in the whole di&s;|trict; is near the river Samara, and ju&s;t oppo&s;ite the highe&s;t of all the mountains &s;een on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the water. They had dug to the depth of ten feet and a half, which was the exact height the hill was rai&s;ed from the ground; and it is &s;aid, they found in it &s;ome valuable things. I found my&s;elf, in the ground that was thrown up, a little piece of poli&s;hed and carved mother-of-pearl, which &s;eemed not the lea&s;t decayed, and I found al&s;o, a great many human and marmot bones. Within the cave was laid a large flat, rock-&s;tone, which probably had covered the body. The &s;tone which I was told lay on the &s;urface, and on which was engraved or cut, the complete figure of a man, was broken into &s;mall pieces, and from what I could &s;ee of it, appeared to be of a very &s;oft, &s;andy na|ture, of which, a great variety is dug from an adja|cent mountain; but the other &s;tone, which &s;tood at the
<PB N="152" REF="157">
ea&s;t end upright, is a hard and nearly triangular flat piece of rock, about four &s;pans and a half in height, and it's upper angle apparently bearing &s;ome rough touches of a chizel, &s;haping out the face of a man.</P>
<P>In the&s;e tumuli are found bad iron-work, points of arrows, and &s;teels to &s;trike fire with, and in &s;ome, heads of hor&s;es. They told me, that the large&s;t tumuli con|tain no valuable articles, &s;uch things being only found in the &s;maller ones. The rea&s;on perhaps is, that the &s;maller tumuli were the graves of women, to whom &s;ome ornaments were &s;acrificed; whereas, the higher tumuli &s;eem either to have belonged to the Tartars of Nagaja, or to the Kirgui&s;ians, as their pre&s;ent tombs much re&s;emble the&s;e. But tho&s;e that are lined with brick, as many are, probably belonged to &s;ome older nation.</P>
<P>About thirty-&s;ix miles &s;hort of Orenburg, is the fortre&s;s Tali&s;t&s;chewa, &s;ituated on a con&s;iderable height, where the river Kamy&s;ch Samara falls into the Jaik. It is a regular &s;quare, walled with timber, with che|vaux-de-frize and wooden batteries, and a double church, one for the &s;ummer, and a &s;maller one, with fire-places, for the winter, garri&s;oned by a party of dragoons, and &s;ettled by Co&s;&s;acks. Here are good hou&s;es belonging to the officers, and about 200 wood|en dwellings; con&s;equently, next to Orenburg, this may be con&s;idered as one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t populous
<PB N="153" REF="158">
places of the Jaikian line. Here re&s;ide al&s;o the of|ficers of the troops quartered in other forts, and the commanders-in-chief of the di&s;trict. I &s;aw the troops exerci&s;ed, and was pre&s;ent at &s;ome of their amu&s;e|ments, in company with the commanding officer. The Kalmucks entertained us fir&s;t with a concert, in their own way; a tolerable, good voice &s;ung various Kalmuc love-&s;ongs, con&s;i&s;ting of di&s;torted and mournful tones and di&s;&s;onances. Two others accompanied the voice, one with a Turki&s;h rebeck with four &s;trings, the other with a remarkable kind of flute, made of the dry and hollow &s;talk of the American &s;un-flower, <HI>(Umbellata,)</HI> covered with a gut. It had three holes at the &s;mall end, which were &s;topped occa&s;ionally, with three fingers of one hand; whil&s;t the other hand, ac|cording to the tune, &s;topped the bottom of the flute or pipe. The upper-end or orifice, without any mouth-piece, is applied to the upper teeth, and clo&s;ed be|tween the upper lip and the tongue. It requires an extraordinary exertion of the voice, to produce &s;ounds upon &s;uch a pipe; but, in the hands of a good player it re&s;embles a fife. The Kalmucks call it <HI>Zurr,</HI> the Tartars <HI>Kurah,</HI> and the Co&s;&s;acks of Jaik, who al&s;o make u&s;e of it, give it the name of <HI>T&s;chibui&s;ga.</HI> The rebeck is called <HI>Biwa</HI> by the Kalmucks, and has no other bottom than a hollow, wooden cylinder, over which is &s;tretched a dryed bladder, as parchment over a drum. On this a bridge is fixed, and over this four lengths of cat-gut are &s;trained on a long handle.
<PB N="154" REF="159">
It is played with a bow, on which two rows of hor&s;e|hair are &s;trained. The&s;e pa&s;s through the &s;trings in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;ound two in uni&s;on, at the &s;ame draw of the bow. Be&s;ides the above in&s;truments, the Kalmucks have a two-&s;tringed ba&s;e-viol, a harp like a dulcimer, and a large jews-harp, which make up their ba&s;e.</P>
<P>Next, &s;everal couples of young lads gave us a &s;pe|cimen of their art in wre&s;tling. When at this &s;port, they tuck up their under-robes round their wai&s;t, and &s;trive to throw each other down, and are very clever at this exerci&s;e. They then &s;hot at a mark with arrows, and next into the air; and concluded their diver&s;ions with a game at che&s;s, wherein they followed all the cu&s;tomary rules, except advancing at the beginning with three men, in&s;tead of one.</P>
<P>The Ba&s;kirs could amu&s;e us only with arrow-&s;hoot|ing and Tartarian dances. But what was remarkable, a man hoary with age, and having only two teeth in his mouth, played very ma&s;terly on the above-men|tioned flute, and was even &s;o expert as to play two tunes at once. The &s;ongs of the Tartars, compared with Kalmuck melody, were as the Italian mu&s;ic is to the French, and expre&s;&s;ed generally &s;omething warlike and manly. The Tartarian dances con&s;i&s;t in a tran&s;|po&s;ition of the feet, and &s;ome very voluptuous atti|tudes
<PB N="155" REF="160">
and motions of the body and limbs, accompa|nied with hi&s;&s;ing and clapping of hands.</P>
<P>Here I met with a plant which I never &s;aw any de|&s;cription of, nor ever met with, any where el&s;e. The <HI>Prenanthes hi&s;pida.</HI> The phea&s;ant is a bird not uncommon here, and it's feathers are worn as an orna|ment in the cap.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 30. On the 30th of June, I pur&s;ued my jour|ney to Orenburg, and was obliged to be e&s;corted by relieves of Co&s;&s;acks, or &s;ome other light troops, from po&s;t to po&s;t, to be &s;afe again&s;t the Kirgui&s;ian plunderers, and it was at this &s;ea&s;on the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e, for want of &s;ufficient pa&s;ture at home, they had brought their cattle to pa&s;ture here, and had taken up their quarters in this di&s;trict.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of July, I had about twelve miles to travel to Orenburg, and &s;et out for that place in the morning. The de&s;cription of this beautiful city and it's environs, and al&s;o of it's public buildings, has been &s;o amply and ably &s;et forth already, that was I to &s;ay any thing of it, I &s;hould only be a copyi&s;t. I will, however, venture to &s;ay from my&s;elf, that the &s;itua|tion of this place is very advantageous for A&s;iatic com|merce. They endeavour to make it the centre of it, and it is perfectly adapted to that end, and to be the re&s;idence of wealthy merchants, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment
<PB N="156" REF="161">
of &s;uch manufactures, as the ea&s;tern nations are mo&s;t in want of. Was &s;uch a plan &s;et on foot, Orenburg would inconte&s;tibly become one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing and important provincial cities, of the whole Ru&s;&s;ian Empire. Yet the profitable trade of this place is chiefly carried on by adventurers from the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the empire, who, after having bartered their goods or &s;old them, return with their gain to their re&s;pective countries. The&s;e people come annually in great caravans, bringing with them foreign goods of all kinds, which this place it&s;elf and it's environs would produce, if manufactories were erected, and properly conducted.</P>
<P>The trade of this city con&s;i&s;ts now in the &s;ale of all &s;orts of woollen cloths, e&s;pecially red and &s;carlet, vel|vet, blue and white linens, hides, copper and iron kettles, chiefly brought here from the mo&s;t di&s;tant ma|nufactories of Siberia; all &s;orts of ornaments for dre&s;s of tin and iron, needles, thimbles, gla&s;s and coral beads, and other little matters requi&s;ite for cloathing, and for the harne&s;s of hor&s;es. Al&s;o all materials for dying, &s;uch as indigo, woad, cochineal, allum, vitri|ol, likewi&s;e &s;ugar, and &s;ome kinds of furs, particular|ly beaver and otter fur. Be&s;ides the&s;e things, the Kirgui&s;ians purcha&s;e of the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants a great deal of cotton &s;tuffs, and barter it to the Bucharians for furs; of cour&s;e, the cotton-manufactories of this country are very profitable, and bring in a large reve|nue
<PB N="157" REF="162">
to the empire, though the Ru&s;&s;ians purcha&s;e the materials of which the cotton is made, of the Bucha|rians and the people of Chiwinza. I am well a&s;&s;ured, that there are many di&s;tricts in the &s;outhern parts of Ru&s;&s;ia, where the cotton-plant thrives well, and it might therefore be an inland production. It has not indeed thriven in the di&s;tricts of Orenburg and the Sakmara; the Tartars having made an un&s;ucce&s;sful trial of it. But this is owing to the great change from heat to cold, occa&s;ioned by the adjacent mountains, to the poorne&s;s of the &s;oil, and the dryne&s;s of the land. Were &s;uch attempts made on the rivers Samara, Mot&s;|cha, Irgis, and &s;ome of the lower di&s;tricts of the Wol|ga, they would be attended with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The principal articles which the A&s;iatic merchants, who come here in caravans, barter for the above-men|tioned goods, are gold and &s;ilver, chiefly in Per&s;ian coin and Rupees, gold-du&s;t, &s;ome lapis-lazuli, rubies and other precious &s;tones; al&s;o a great deal of raw and &s;pun cotton, a kind of finer Indian callico, than what is ge|neral, ready-made gowns of various goodne&s;s; black and grey, fine, Bucharian lamb-&s;kins, which are &s;old at a great price, two kinds of wild cat-&s;kins, &s;potted like a tyger's, tygers &s;kins, &amp;c. Sometimes the Bucharians will bring lumps of &s;altpetre, which is found in ma&s;&s;es in &s;uch parts of their country as were the &s;cite of old towns and burial-places. Their commerce now, in raw &s;ilk, is very low, and all kind of finer Indian mer|chandize
<PB N="158" REF="163">
is brought but &s;paringly, either becau&s;e there are not &s;ufficient buyers among the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants, or becau&s;e the Bucharians, as they them&s;elves acknow|ledge, could not get &s;uch a price for them as would be adequate to the expence of bringing them. It is al&s;o to be con&s;idered, that the northern part of India does not produce &s;uch rich articles as are manufactured in the warmer climes which lie near the Indian ocean; &s;o that were the Bucharians ever &s;o willing to bring them, they could not expect to rival the &s;ea-trade in &s;uch kind of merchandize.</P>
<P>But, among the Bucharian trafic, I mu&s;t not omit to mention &s;uch articles as relate to natural hi&s;tory.&mdash; They bring then &s;everal fruits of their own country, as dried, wild apricots and peaches, a kind of &s;mall cur|rants, which have either a very large kernel or none at all; nuts of the &s;pecies of the beech-tree; worm-&s;eed, which they &s;ay they get from India, and which, if thrown into canals in gardens and plantations, will de|&s;troy particular worms and catipillars. They bring al|&s;o &s;eed of melons, water-melons and wild Bucharian barley. <HI>(Holcus Saccharatus).</HI></P>
<P>There is no branch of the Bucharian trade more im|portant, or any that would turn out more advantageous to the &s;tate, by encrea&s;ing the Ru&s;&s;ian manufactories, than the importation of raw-goods; among which, the &s;ilk-trade has been but little encouraged. Camel's
<PB N="159" REF="164">
hair would be another rich article of commerce, as it might not only be manufactured at home, but be ex|ported: and it can be purcha&s;ed of the Kalmucks and Kirgui&s;ians, at the cheap rate from two &s;hillings Eng|li&s;h to eleven &s;hillings, for 36 pounds weight.</P>
<P>Bartering with the Kirgui&s;ians for cattle, is al&s;o a lu|crative branch of commerce. Scarce a year pa&s;&s;es but they &s;ell to the number of from 40, to 60,000 &s;heep, and about 10,000 hor&s;es. The latter are conveyed into Ru&s;&s;ia; but the &s;heep are mo&s;tly killed in and about Orenburg, and the towns &s;ituated on the Wolga. The fat is tran&s;ported to the &s;ea-ports of the empire, where it is &s;old for very little money, under the deno|mination of Ru&s;&s;ian tallow. Mutton therefore is to be had at Orenburg, in the &s;ummer-time, for little or nothing, as the dealers are contented with the gain they get from the fat of the tail only of a Kirgui&s;ian &s;heep, which weighs &s;ometimes about 36 pounds, and after being melted down, will yield thirty pounds and up|wards of tallow.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this great quantity of large and &s;mall cattle, the Kirgui&s;ians bring to market a great number of com|mon furs, wolves-&s;kins, foxes, wild-cat &s;kins, and many &s;lunk lamb-&s;kins. The Kirgui&s;ians al&s;o &s;ell great variety of felt-covers and carpets, which they make of &s;heeps-wool, elegant and of various colours. As the&s;e people are but little &s;killed in commerce, they truck
<PB N="160" REF="165">
them away for Ru&s;&s;ian commodities of &s;mall value, though they are now daily improving in cunning and prudence.</P>
<P>There is brought to market at Orenburg, the gold eagle, <HI>(Falco Chry&s;atus,)</HI> of which the Kirguifians are very fond, purcha&s;ing them for hunting of wolves, foxes, and antelopes. There is a certain token in the motion of this bird, by which they judge of it's good|ne&s;s and docility, for they are not all adapted to the chace. A Kirgui&s;ian will &s;ometimes give an excellent hor&s;e for one of the&s;e birds; when for another, he would not give even a &s;heep-&s;kin, which among them is one of their &s;malle&s;t coins. To judge then of a gold eagle, they will often &s;it a great while looking at it. I mu&s;t al&s;o mention, that the Kalmucks and Ba&s;chirs breed a great many camels, which they &s;ell at Orenburg to the Bucharians, who commonly leave this city with much greater loads than they bring. The Bucharians bring their goods on the backs of lit|tle a&s;&s;es, and afterwards try to di&s;po&s;e of them, but the people here do not like them, nor has this animal or the mule, been ever bred in Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 3. On the 3d of July, I had the plea&s;ure of going to, and in&s;pecting the &s;alt-works of Ilezkaja, 50 miles off, in company with his Excellency Major Ge|neral Rein&s;dorff, the pre&s;ent governor of Orenburg, e&s;corted with a &s;trong guard of Co&s;&s;acks, relieved
<PB N="161" REF="166">
from po&s;t to po&s;t. To go to this place, we cro&s;s a bridge of boats, which connects the city of Orenburg, with the great and well-built market-place. All the heath from Orenburg, for a di&s;tance of 17 miles, had been wantonly fired by the Kirgui&s;ians, which is too often done in this wild country, and prevented me finding even a &s;ingle root of that curious plant, which has been de&s;cribed by Dr. Rinder, and named from him.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;alt-works have a &s;mall fortre&s;s to defend them, garri&s;oned by Co&s;&s;acks. The town is inhabited by thirty &s;uperintendants over an exiled people, by whom rock-&s;alt is here dug, at the expence of the crown. There is one captain who pre&s;ides over the works, and another who commands the fort.</P>
<P>About 280 feet &s;outh-ea&s;t of this fort, ri&s;es a bare and white &s;tucco mountain, in form of a &s;ugar-loaf, full of clefts, and is called the watch-mountain, from having a guard of &s;oldiers &s;tationed on the top of it, commanding a view over a con&s;iderable part of the country. On the top is a cleft, which once was very deep, but is now partly filled up. The Kirgui&s;ians con&s;ider this mountain as divine, and u&s;ed formerly to throw various furs and other trifles into the cleft, by way of vow or &s;acrifice. Even to this day, they come round the hill at certain times, in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, and &s;ay their prayers, kneeling; having fir&s;t bathed and
<PB N="162" REF="167">
cleaned them&s;elves in the adjacent pools. It is related, that before the pit or cleft was filled up, &s;ome covet|ous per&s;on in hopes of finding trea&s;ure, made a de&s;cent into it, and found the cold in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>Between the watch-mountain and the fort, lies the &s;alt-vein; it's greate&s;t diameter is about 600 fathoms, (each fathom &s;even feet Engli&s;h,) and the cro&s;s dia|meter 550. To get at the rock-&s;alt, they dig &s;ome|times three or four fathoms deep, but in &s;ome places it lies &s;o high, that we may touch the &s;olid &s;alt with a dagger, or a ram-rod. There are a great many fre&s;h|water &s;prings about this place, which &s;eem to run all to this &s;alt-rock, and in &s;uch quantities, as &s;ometimes to interrupt the working it.</P>
<P><HI>Salt-mines.</HI> The nature both of the &s;alt, and the ground which covers it, may be be&s;t &s;een in that large and open mine, where they are digging at pre&s;ent, and have &s;o done, for many years pa&s;t. This mine, down|wards from the watch-mountain, including all it's windings, is about 300 fathoms. The pit, or open part at top, is now above &s;ixty fathoms long, and in &s;ome places, from nine to ten fathoms broad, and the &s;alt has been dug out in places, to the depth of three fa|thoms; but, by the orders of General Rein&s;dorff, they are now going deeper. They had no method of lading out the water from this mine, but by pails, his excel|lency
<PB N="163" REF="168">
has, however, had a depending part dug, and the water is from thence worked out by a machine.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent method of digging the &s;alt, is as fol|lows: they fir&s;t dig narrow cro&s;s-drains with pick-axes, to a certain depth, &s;o as to leave a block of &s;alt, about an ell broad, and an ell and a half to two fathoms long, between the channels, and this block is rai&s;ed by levers, wedges, and breakers.</P>
<P>Over the pure and &s;olid rock-&s;alt, in it's whole ex|tent, is nothing but a miry land, con&s;i&s;ting of a coar&s;e yellow quick-&s;and, lying in heaps, from two to three fathoms high. Near the bed of &s;alt, the &s;and is pe|netrated with &s;alt water, and if dried, becomes hard as &s;tone. The vein of &s;alt does not &s;eem to lie horizon|tally, but to wave, being in &s;ome places deeper, in others &s;hallower.</P>
<P>How deep the&s;e mines run, is not known with any certainty, they are working now only on the &s;urface. The mountain-borer, which I directed to be applied, (but with great labour,) could not be worked down more than half an ell a day, into the &s;olid rock. It has been pierced in autumn, to the depth of rather better than twenty ells, but it could be bored no far|ther, being &s;topped by a black, impenetrable &s;tone. In a &s;haft, at &s;ome little di&s;tance from the great &s;alt-pit, they met with a blacki&s;h marle, (at the depth of three
<PB N="164" REF="169">
fathoms,) &s;o &s;olid, that it could not be removed with &s;pades.</P>
<P>The &s;alt is generally very pure, &s;olid, and of a white colour, and breaks, when knocked to pieces, in little &s;quare lumps, like dice. It di&s;&s;olves in water rather &s;lower than &s;ea-&s;alt, but has been found not &s;o &s;trong to &s;alt meat with. Some ma&s;&s;es of about 36lb. weight, are here and there found as clear and tran&s;parent as chry&s;tal, and capable of being worked into boxes, and other toys.</P>
<P>Here are a great many &s;alt-pools near this &s;pot, in which the Kirgui&s;ians occa&s;ionally bathe, for the cure of certain di&s;orders. The water is &s;o powerful, that a man who goes into it brea&s;t-high, is lifted up, and lies upon the &s;urface like a plank. It is a common &s;aying, that the water in the&s;e pits is at certain times, during the cold weather in autumn, cold on the &s;ur|face, but near the bottom &s;o warm, and &s;ometimes &s;o hot, as not to bear the hand in it, but I could find no difference in any I felt, which during cloudy and cool weather, was five degrees colder than the air. If this report be true, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;alt cru&s;t covering the bottom of the pool, attracts the &s;un's heat like a burning-gla&s;s, and thus renders the water near it hot. Admitting this to be the ca&s;e, the rea|&s;on why I could di&s;cover no difference was, that the
<PB N="165" REF="170">
&s;un had not &s;hone, when I was there, for &s;everal days. I don't know of any rea&s;on more probable.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common plant growing here is, the &s;alt-wort, <HI>(Salicornia herbacea,)</HI> which, being pickled with &s;pice and vinegar, is a very palatable &s;auce. The plantain, <HI>(Plantago Sal&s;a,)</HI> growing on this land, takes on a very pale red-colour, and is very &s;alt to the ta&s;te. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that from this and other &s;alt-plants, the &s;alt [alkali, <HI>(&s;oda)</HI> might be prepared: but, in a chemical proce&s;s on the &s;alt-wort, at Orenburg, it was found to contain too much culinary &s;alt. Sixty or &s;eventy pound weight of this plant dried, yielded twenty pounds of &s;alt-a&s;hes. I &s;hall &s;hew hereafter, that the Ru&s;&s;ians, prepare and export great quantities of alkali, but yet none from this plant.</P>
<P>The &s;alt of Ilezkaja, is mo&s;tly dug in &s;ummer|time, the workmen are paid at the rate of half a co|pec, for 36lb. weight. There were now laying before the pit many ton weight of &s;alt, ready to be conveyed away. Winter is the &s;ea&s;on of tran&s;porting it, which is done by the Ba&s;kirs and vagaband pea&s;ants, who have wandered from different provinces of the Empire, and are &s;ettled in the di&s;trict of Orenburg. The price of tran&s;port from the mine to the &s;alt-office, at the river A&s;chkader, is paid at the rate of &s;ix copecs or a|bout 3d. Engli&s;h, per pud, (each pud 36lb. Engli&s;h.) Thence it is conveyed in barges on the rivers Belaja,
<PB N="166" REF="171">
Kama, and Wolga. In this way did they tran&s;port throughout the Empire, in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year, above a million of puds, and the quantity conveyed away mu&s;t have been con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed, &s;ince that time, by the pre&s;ent, well-directed regulations; two new &s;alt-offices having been erected, one upon the ri|ver Ik, and the other on the Samara.</P>
<P>Before I leave this remarkable &s;pot, I mu&s;t mention, that notwith&s;tanding the &s;altne&s;s of the &s;oil, in one of the gardens here, not only divers &s;orts of vegetables &s;eemed to thrive well, but the tobacco plant, rai&s;ed from Virginia &s;eed, came on well, and had a fine &s;mell; which leaves not the lea&s;t doubt, but that tobacco might be rai&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s, on the &s;alt heaths, between the rivers Jaik and Wolga. It ought al&s;o to be noticed, that even in this &s;alt di&s;trict, as al&s;o upon the whole &s;outhern &s;tep or heath about the river Jaik, the garden tulip, <HI>(Tulipa Ge&s;neri,)</HI> with yel|low and red cups, is every where &s;een. They are ra|ther &s;maller than our European ones, yet have been known to encrea&s;e in their &s;ize con&s;iderably, by re|moving them into good garden &s;oil.</P>
<P>Before I quit Orenburg, I will take notice of a neighbouring copper-mine. Though I did not &s;ee it my&s;elf, I am able to de&s;cribe it, from the accounts I received. This mine is not far from Orenburg, and formerly belonged to Count Alexander Schuwalof, who
<PB N="167" REF="172">
has &s;ince &s;old it, with &s;ome other lands, &amp;c. It has not for eight years been worked, any thing worth men|tioning. To protect the workmen from the Kirgui&s;i|ans, on one of who&s;e heaths it &s;tands, the place is de|fended by an intrenchment, and guarded by &s;ome ord|nance, and a company of &s;oldiers. This di&s;covery was made &s;ome years back, in the old &s;hafts, &s;cattered about the mountain. Upon all the Uralian mountains are many &s;uch old &s;hafts or pits &s;een, which have been undoubtedly made in former times by &s;ome indu&s;tri|ous miners, but unknown to us. The mo&s;t con&s;ider|able mines in the di&s;trict of Orenburg, owe their di&s;|covery to old ve&s;tiges of the&s;e miners, which con&s;i&s;t of round pits, and deep &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages, &s;ome of them &s;o narrow, that they mu&s;t have had much trouble to work in them. In many, they could not &s;tand up|right. Near Saigat&s;chi Rudnik &s;everal pits have been found and a &s;tream-work uncommonly &s;pacious and in very good &s;tate. On clearing it out, they di&s;covered &s;ome cakes of melted copper and &s;ome round pots of white clay, in which they melted the ore, al&s;o &s;ome bones of workmen, on whom the ground had fallen in, but not the lea&s;t traces of a hearth or furnace. In &s;ome of the&s;e old &s;pots they have found a beautiful green and clear copperas.</P>
<P>The &s;tone in which the ore lies, in a very compact green ma&s;s, is yellow, &s;oft, coar&s;e and &s;andy, and above the ore, lie broken layers of &s;oft, red marble, but the
<PB N="168" REF="173">
mo&s;t curious circum&s;tance is that near the ore in the &s;and-&s;tone, is almo&s;t every where &s;mall and large pieces of trunks of trees, petrified into a kind of rock, that rings when &s;truck with a &s;teel, and gives fire like a flint. Some of the&s;e petrifactions are brown and &s;eem to be pieces of linden and other trees, and encru&s;ted with ver|digrea&s;e and blue vitriol.</P>
<P>However rare &s;uch wood-petrifactions are in other di&s;tricts, yet the ores dug in the &s;outhern di&s;tricts of the Uralian mountains abound with them. All the mines along the middle part of the river Jaik both on the Ru&s;|&s;ian and Kirgui&s;ian &s;ide; and tho&s;e near the rivulets and brooks that flow into the Samara, are more or le&s;s crowded with &s;uch petrified pieces of wood, and &s;ooty pieces of &s;prays, re&s;embling charcoal. They often find huge trunks, with &s;ome of their roots and branches. In the winter 1768, I &s;ent from Orenburg, to the mu|&s;eum of natural hi&s;tory, at Peter&s;burgh, a piece of root, which had lain &s;everal years in this city, and was larger than could be compa&s;&s;ed by the arms; it belonged to a trunk near &s;eventy feet long. It's back was changed into a rich, copper ore, having been found in the mine above-mentioned, with another laying acro&s;s it, under|neath a layer of black ground.</P>
<P>Along the line of the Jaik are wooden redoubts, erec|ted at certain di&s;tances, and in the midway between each is a guard &s;tation and a pyramid erected on &s;ome
<PB N="169" REF="174">
high ground, with wreaths of pitched cords and other inflammable materials, wound round them, which are occa&s;ionally &s;et fire to, as a &s;ignal to the adjacent guard-&s;tation, when the plundering and rapacious Kirgui&s;ians have made any incur&s;ion or committed any depredati|on.</P>
<P>We here met with a Chiwian caravan, con&s;i&s;ting of thirty camels, which, for want of food in this parched country, were &s;carce able to walk. Tho&s;e u&s;ed by the A&s;iatic caravans are mo&s;tly two bunched camels, or dromedaries. Tho&s;e with one bunch on their back, are &s;eldom u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e. They pa&s;s a cord through the bridge of their no&s;es, and, during their march, tie one to the tail of another, the goods hang|ing in large bales on both &s;ides on wooden pack-&s;ad|dles. Each load is wrapt in a coar&s;e, cotton &s;tuff, tied with cotton &s;trings, and to &s;helter it from the wea|ther, is covered with felts tied on with hair-ropes. For riding and the carriage of provi&s;ions, they u&s;e a&s;&s;es, not unlike European ones.</P>
<P>On one of the&s;e mountains, in this di&s;trict, is dug talc in &s;heets, which are fit for window lights, but it is never found in pieces above a yard &s;quare; and as it is not genuine i&s;ing-gla&s;s or talc, but only a gyp&s;eous &s;pathum, which does not &s;plit pure and fine, is de&s;titute of the other properties of genuine talc, it does not de|&s;erve much attention. This mountain was &s;urveyed in
<PB N="170" REF="175">
1757, by a land-&s;urveyor, &s;ent from the mine-office, at Orenburg, who has fixed it's di&s;tance at about four miles from the fortre&s;s Sheltoi, erected upon the Sa|mara.</P>
<P>The brooks in the vicinage of the&s;e mountains &s;well &s;o much in &s;pring, from the abundance of &s;now-water, that one &s;ees whole trees drawn up by the roots and ly|ing about in them. On &s;ome of the&s;e mountains is found a great deal of ja&s;per, &s;ome of a pale-green co|lour and &s;ome flaming red. On one, the fortre&s;s Or&s;|kaja is erected, about half a mile from the mouth of the river Or. In it's centre, &s;tands a pretty &s;tone-built church, which may be &s;een on all &s;ides from far. Near it &s;tands the uncommonly well-&s;ituated ob&s;ervatory, erec|ted by Lieutenant <HI>Euler,</HI> to ob&s;erve the tran&s;it of Venus over the Sun; round about the hill are dwelling-hou&s;es, but none tolerable, except that of the commanding-offi|cer, who is a lieutenant-general. The A&s;iatic caravans, which go to Orenburg, cro&s;s the river Jaik at this part of the Ru&s;&s;ian-boundary. Here their goods are &s;ealed up, and they can &s;ell only as much as will enable them to hire waggons to carry their merchandize on, in ca&s;e they &s;hould knock up their camels.</P>
<P>The mountain on which this fort &s;tands con&s;i&s;ts en|tirely of Ja&s;per. The &s;tone on the &s;urface is rough and rocky, but the deeper, the more fine and beautiful is the colour, a very plea&s;ing, pale &s;ea-green and a deep
<PB N="171" REF="176">
brown-red. Some is white, &s;ome grey, and a great deal of it is black with flame-coloured veins and &s;pots. It has been often dug into by miners &s;ent from the Peter&s;burgh manufactory at Catherineburgh, and I am per&s;uaded, was it properly done by regular &s;hafts, it would produce beautiful plates of ja&s;per. By exa|mining into the nature and mixture of the&s;e ja&s;pers, it cannot be doubted, but that they were formerly a &s;oft, varied-coloured loam, now petrified. On the upper|mo&s;t parts of this mountain is nothing to be &s;een but a milk-white quartz, &s;carcely covered with earth. On the &s;ummit of all the mountains, in this chain along the Jaik, are Kirgui&s;ian tumuli, con&s;i&s;ting of the be&s;t ja&s;per. Great pains have been taken to &s;elect &s;uch a heap of ja&s;per-&s;tone as form the&s;e graves, which ri&s;e con&s;iderably from the ground.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 13. I vi&s;ited this chain of mountains about the middle of July. The valleys have a &s;alti&s;h &s;oil, and lead one to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;alts, which are derived from the burning of the heath and the urine of the cat|tle, afterwards wa&s;hed down into the vales by the rain and &s;now, are additional cau&s;es of the many &s;alt &s;pots found in the &s;outhern &s;teps; though it is pa&s;t a doubt that the &s;tronge&s;t of them originate from &s;ome hidden and &s;ubterraneous &s;ources, for there is no di&s;trict in the known world that can boa&s;t of &s;uch an abundance of mineral &s;alt, as the &s;outhern parts of Ru&s;&s;ia, Siberia, and the va&s;t extent of Tartary.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="177">The line of forts all along the river Jaik, were erec|ted to defend the interior provinces of Ru&s;&s;ia from the incur&s;ions of the Kirge&s;e. The&s;e forts are &s;eldom gar|ri&s;oned with more than a company of &s;oldiers from twen|ty to thirty in number. For though the Kirgui&s;ians are very fond of plunder, they do not like the Arabs make their inroads in large bodies, but in &s;mall gangs, and &s;hew but little courage.</P>
<P><HI>Jaizkoi Ka&s;at&s;chei Gorodok, July,</HI> 25. In tracing the river Jaik I reached Jaizkoi Gorodok, the chief city of the Jaikian Co&s;&s;acks, on the 25th of July. This place is &s;ituated (according to the ob&s;ervations made by Lieutenant <HI>Euler,</HI> in my pre&s;ence) in north latitude 51 deg. 10 min. 46 &s;ec. at the banks between which once flowed the Jaik, who&s;e cour&s;e is now more ea&s;tern and &s;traight. The di&s;trict about the city is elevated and tolerably even. The city is very irregularly built in form of a cre&s;cent; in one part it is encompa&s;&s;ed with a brea&s;t-work, &s;upported with chevaux-de-frize and a ditch, and is furni&s;hed with &s;ome pieces of ordnance, but is open to the river Jaik, being on that &s;ide &s;afe enough. The number of wooden dwelling-hou&s;es, which are chiefly built according to the old Ru&s;&s;ian fa&s;hion, but large and &s;pacious, amounts to about 3000. They are in general divided into narrow &s;treets, and built very clo&s;e together. The principal &s;treet, which cro&s;&s;es the whole-city, from the &s;ide towards Orenburg to the river T&s;chagan, is very crooked and irregular, but it is
<PB N="173" REF="178">
wide and ornamented with the be&s;t hou&s;es, Near this &s;treet &s;tands a good &s;tone-built church and the market, where there are all &s;orts of provi&s;ions and many other things. Farther on, towards the well-built cathedral, are a great many &s;hops, under the hou&s;es, where foreign merchants &s;ell a great deal of good merchandize very cheap: a little beyond this, are the &s;uburbs, where the Co&s;&s;acks of this nation live together, and have a <HI>Me&s;ched,</HI> or hou&s;e of prayer, built with wood and paint|ed white. There is al&s;o a third church built with wood, in this principal &s;treet, be&s;ides which, there are two chapels built with the &s;ame materials, but with few or|naments; and which are very &s;eldom attended by the Co&s;&s;acks, who call them&s;elves the <HI>Old Faithful,</HI> and perform their devotions chiefly in their own hou&s;es; &s;o that even on the mo&s;t &s;olemn fe&s;tivals, they &s;carce do more than a&s;&s;emble round the church, during the time of &s;ervice, or &s;it and kneel on the out&s;ide of the build|ing. It is a&s;cribed to this prejudice, that a church which had been burnt down and they had began to rebuild with wood, more than twenty years back, remains at this day unfini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The city, in general, is very populous. Be&s;ides the great number of foreign merchants, who re&s;ide there at all times, and a &s;till greater number of hired people and workmen, who get their living there, it is calcu|lated that the Co&s;&s;acks alone amount to above. 50,000, among which are reckoned 4800 enli&s;ted &s;oldiers, be|longing
<PB N="174" REF="179">
partly to the army, and partly to the garri&s;ons of the line. In this number, are a great many Maho|medan Tartars, unconverted Kalmucks, and therefore called <HI>Ky&s;ilba&s;hes,</HI> partly of Truckmenian, partly of Per&s;ian extraction, and generally well-&s;killed in the cultivation of melon-grounds. Tho&s;e who have turn|ed chri&s;tians, are called <HI>Baldyri.</HI> There are al&s;o among the latter many Kalmucks, who have embraced the chri&s;tian religion, that they might not be delivered up to the hordes, from which they have de&s;erted.</P>
<P>The Jaikian Co&s;&s;acks having &s;ettled in an entirely wild country, there is no determining the exact bound|ary of their di&s;trict. On the left &s;hore of the Jaik, which is inhabited by the Kirgui&s;ians, they dare not lay claim to any thing but the hay that grows in the meadows on the we&s;tern &s;ide. They call all the heaths or &s;teps their own, from their city towards the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, as far as the river can be &s;een; and their neighbours on that &s;ide, <HI>viz.</HI> the Ordinzian Kalmucks, conte&s;t not the matter with them. The greate&s;t claim they maintain is, to the river it&s;elf and it's fi&s;heries, of which they are fully ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The chief of the Jaikian Co&s;&s;acks is a per&s;on, called by them <HI>Woi&s;kowoi Ataman,</HI> now re&s;iding in Jaizkoi-Go|rodok, who is e&s;tabli&s;hed by, and is &s;ubordinate to, the council of war belonging to the empire; but his rank is not fixed. He has under him twenty elders, or <HI>Starchins,</HI> the principal of whom are always &s;itting as
<PB N="175" REF="180">
judges in the court-hou&s;e. This council has a record|er, a &s;ecretary, an interpreter, a few clerks, and other officers. The chief, or ataman, has two adjutants; the lower ranks of officers are &s;otniks and de&s;&s;atniks, and no one can arrive at the honour of being an elder or &s;tarchin, till he has &s;erved in the city as a de&s;&s;atnik, &s;otnik, and adjutant; for tho&s;e that &s;erve in the forts, on the line under the&s;e titles, are inferior, in point of rank, to the former. Every officer belonging to this regency has a proper income, and &s;everal privileges from the crown, but tho&s;e who are not converted to the chri&s;tian faith, can never ri&s;e to any dignity higher than a &s;otnik.</P>
<P>The power of this regency is very much circum|&s;cribed, for the con&s;titution of the Jaikians is merely democratical. No public matter can be decided but in a general a&s;&s;embly of the people, which they call <HI>Krug,</HI> (circle.) If any thing is to be done that re|quires a krug, or if the people are to receive any high, imperial commands, the bell rings, which calls them together. The u&s;ual time is between ten and eleven in the forenoon, but the a&s;&s;embly may be con|vened at any other time. At which time, all the Co&s;|&s;acks in the city are drawn up round the court-hou&s;e, which is built with &s;tone, and &s;tands, near the cathe|dral, in a &s;quare, encompa&s;&s;ed with iron rails, round which the people &s;tand, but without any particular order. When the a&s;&s;embly is &s;ufficiently numerous,
<PB N="176" REF="181">
and the chief or ataman, (who is already with his el|ders within the court-hou&s;e,) is made acquainted with it by his adjutants, he goes out on the covered &s;teps before the court-hou&s;e, (having in his hand a &s;taff, with a &s;ilver head, gilt,) accompanied by the elders. The two adjutants then enter the &s;quare, lay their caps and &s;taves on the ground, and after having &s;aid the u&s;ual prayers, bow fir&s;t to the chiefs, next to the elders, and then to the people every way, who return the &s;alute. This done, they take up their caps and &s;taves again, which are the en&s;igns of their order, approach the chief and lay their caps at his feet, bearing their &s;taves in their hands. After having received from the chief the matter to be debated on, they go back to the peo|ple, and when the &s;enior of the two hath called &s;ilence in a particular form, they both repeat the word <HI>Pomol|&s;chite,</HI> (&s;ilence,) and then tell the people aloud, the &s;ubject to be determined on. This done, they col|lect their &s;uffrages or votes, and carry them to the chief, who makes his reply to the people through his adjutants, or informs them of the re&s;ult of the poll. The common acclamation of the people when they con&s;ent, at one of the&s;e meetings, is <HI>Sogla&s;ny wa&s;che Wy &s;oko rodie,</HI> that is, "We acquie&s;ce, high-born gen|tlemen," but they declare their di&s;&s;ent, by <HI>Ne Sog|la&s;ny,</HI> muttering and bringing up the liberties of their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="182">The commands of the &s;upreme council, are an|nounced to the people by their &s;ecretary, who places him&s;elf between the two adjutants, and reads them aloud, the people &s;tanding uncovered.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to mention any thing re&s;pecting the fir&s;t &s;ettlement and events of the Jaikian Co&s;&s;acks, it being mo&s;t circum&s;tantially related in the topography of Orenburg. I will, however, &s;ay &s;omething of their pre&s;ent &s;tate. Their manner and way of living is as free and uncon&s;trained as their government. Young people are continually amu&s;ing them&s;elves with a va|riety of &s;ports, and the old are not a little addicted to drinking and to idlene&s;s. The female &s;ex are at no lo&s;s to give them&s;elves plea&s;ure and delight, as much in intrigue as in dre&s;s. The latter no way dif|fers from that worn by the Ru&s;&s;ians, except in the high colours of their &s;hirts, and the form of their caps, which &s;tand up &s;traight in the front, are round and flat at top, and commonly very richly embroider|ed. That worn by the men is the common Co&s;&s;ack or Poli&s;h dre&s;s. There are among them &s;ome people of knowledge and good manners, and, about the river Jaik, we frequently meet with politene&s;s and cleanli|ne&s;s, which ari&s;es from their intercour&s;e with foreign merchants. They were formerly very uncivilized, and had &s;ome very cruel cu&s;toms. A creditor was au|thorized to &s;eize his debtor, tie a rope about his left arm, and lead him about publickly, or treat him as
<PB N="178" REF="183">
ill and contemptuou&s;ly as he plea&s;ed, till his debt was paid, either by friends or by alms. But as the right arm is u&s;ed among Popi&s;h Co&s;&s;acks to make the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, &s;hould the creditor tie his debtor's right arm by mi&s;take, he incurred a puni&s;hment for &s;o do|ing, and lo&s;t all claim to the debt. When a wife had given her hu&s;band offence, he was at liberty to di&s;po&s;e of her by &s;ale, at any of their publick meetings, and the price paid was often but a trifle.</P>
<P>On all &s;olemnities both of church and &s;tate, the peo|ple a&s;&s;emble about the court-hou&s;e, and are treated with bread, fi&s;h and brandy,</P>
<P>Within the hall, the regalia being removed, the ta|bles are &s;pread with all &s;orts of &s;trong liquors, dried fi&s;h, roe (or caviar) and bread, when the Sovereign's health is drank by the Ataman and Starchins, under the firing of the great guns, and the whole is concluded by drinking to the pro&s;perity of government and the welfare of the community.</P>
<P>Young people enjoy a great deal of amu&s;ement. Their court&s;hip and nuptials de&s;erve to be noticed. From the very day of a &s;olemn betrothing, which is done with many ridiculous circum&s;tances, to the day of marriage, which is &s;eldom &s;ooner than twenty weeks, all the young maidens of the bride's acquaintance a&s;|&s;emble every evening at her hou&s;e, and divert them|&s;elves
<PB N="179" REF="184">
with &s;inging and dancing. During this time, the bridegroom is authorized to take a hu&s;band's liber|ties with his bride, but with &s;ome &s;ecrecy. Before the wedding, the bridegroom pre&s;ents his bride with a com|plete female dre&s;s, and &s;he, in return, pre&s;ents him with a cap, boots, and &s;hirt. When the nuptial cere|mony is over, the bride returns to her hou&s;e from the church in an open waggon <HI>(telega).</HI> Behind her, &s;it her mother and the bride-maid, their fingers full of rings and holding out on each &s;ide a piece of linen to hide the bride's face from the &s;pectators. Before the waggon walks the bridegroom with his father and rela|tions. Behind ride &s;everal, among whom is one car|rying at the end of a long pole, like a flag, a piece of &s;tuff, &s;triped with &s;everal colours, &s;uch as is worn by the Circa&s;&s;ian women, by way of petticoat; and it is &s;trange that the women of this di&s;trict do not wear it likewi&s;e. The nuptials are next celebrated with dancing and &s;ing|ing, and mo&s;tly in the &s;treets. Tartarian dances are frequent at &s;uch fe&s;tivals, and there are many young people who perform the varied and innumerable moti|ons of the body with great &s;trength and wonderful agi|lity. Athletic exerci&s;es they practi&s;e from their child|hood, as al&s;o &s;hooting with the bow, the u&s;e of fire|arms, and the lance, in which they are eminently &s;kil|led.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid, that the line or boundary along the river Jaik, be&s;ides the little forts and &s;tations, are
<PB N="180" REF="185">
chiefly garri&s;oned by Co&s;&s;acks; for this purpo&s;e they enli&s;t every year, about twelfth-tide, a thou&s;and volun|teers to relieve tho&s;e po&s;ted there the year preceding. Many of the&s;e &s;oldiers &s;ettle afterwards in or near the&s;e fortre&s;&s;es, continue in the &s;ervice and breed cattle, act|ing as &s;ub&s;titutes for others, and receive their pay, pre|ferring this life to the laborious and uncertain trade of fi&s;hing. At every new levy, the volunteers are accept|ed at a public meeting, and their pay is there &s;ettled, according to each man's re&s;pective circum&s;tances, ge|nerally as little as po&s;&s;ible. For the&s;e troops they elect a certain number of officers, and the colonel is &s;ubor|dinate to the Ataman.</P>
<P>I will proceed now to their &s;everal employs and the manner in which the Jaikian Co&s;&s;acks get their living. They have among them&s;elves, &s;hoe-makers, &s;miths, carpenters, &amp;c. and never &s;uffer &s;trangers of the&s;e de|nominations to &s;ettle among them. Their town is &s;up|plied with &s;uch articles as are not made here, by foreign traders, who travel to this place to purcha&s;e fi&s;h. Some of the Co&s;&s;ack women make camblets of different good|ne&s;s and value; the mo&s;t common &s;ort is very durable and cheap, and they manufacture &s;ome of &s;o &s;uperfine a quality, as not only to rival the camblets of Bru&s;&s;els, but would excell them, was it not for the defect com|mon to all their drapery and &s;tuff, that of being made in very &s;mall and narrow pieces. The Tartarian name of the&s;e &s;tuffs is <HI>Armak,</HI> and &s;eems to have been invented by
<PB N="181" REF="186">
the Kirgui&s;ians or Kirge&s;e, who&s;e women manufacture a coar&s;e kind of camblet. As camel-hair is to be bought here in great perfection, and at &s;o low a price as about 9s. Engli&s;h for 36 pounds weight, it is a pity that encouragement is not given them to manufacture a &s;tuff of this hair in large pieces, which would find pur|cha&s;ers every where. They, at pre&s;ent, breed very few camels, not &s;elling any great number to the A&s;iatic caravans; but there is no animal that would thrive bet|ter on, or are more fond of, the &s;alt plants that over|&s;pread the heaths of this di&s;trict.</P>
<P>Breeding of cattle is one of the principal occupati|ons of the Co&s;&s;acks; but the Ru&s;&s;ians attend only to hor&s;es, and to horned cattle. Both pro&s;per well in this warm country, and acquire a hand&s;ome form. Their hor&s;es are no way inferior to Ru&s;&s;ian hor&s;es, in beauty, &s;trength and courage. They live both &s;um|mer and winter on the heaths, and never fare better, till when taken up to hard labour. The dry ground gives them a fine, hard hoof, and renders &s;hoeing un|nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>On account of their breeding of cattle, many of the Co&s;&s;acks have enclo&s;ures or cattle-yards, on tho&s;e parts of the heaths, where there is the be&s;t pa&s;ture. Such Tartars, as keep great flocks of &s;heep, wan|der about with tents, made of felts, but the Ru&s;&s;ians erect wicker huts, where they gather their &s;heep at
<PB N="182" REF="187">
night, and plai&s;ter the&s;e huts with mud. They drive great herds of cattle from the Jaik to the Wolga, and tran&s;port great quantities of hides and tallow to tho&s;e towns, where there are a number of tanneries, and &s;oap-manufactories, as Ca&s;an, Jaro&s;law, Ar&s;amas, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Another branch of employ is hunting heath or &s;tep-foxes, wolves, beavers, and wild boars, of which &s;port they are very fond. The &s;ea&s;on for this, is the fir&s;t three winter-months, when they are tracked in the &s;now. And they follow this bu&s;ine&s;s clo&s;e up, e&s;pecially when they have had an un&s;ucce&s;sful fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>But the chief employment of the Co&s;&s;acks about the river Jaik is fi&s;hing, wherein they are regulated by many cu&s;tomary laws. They fi&s;h but four times a year in that river, and only three of the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons they con|&s;ider of any importance. The fir&s;t principal time is in January, when they fi&s;h with hooks; the &s;econd is in May, and continues till June; the third, and lea&s;t con&s;iderable, is the autumnal &s;ea&s;on, in October, and they fini&s;h in the beginning of December, with nets; which they &s;et under the ice, not in the Jaik it&s;elf, but in it's branches, and the lakes upon the heaths. At this lake fi&s;hing-time, they catch only a few &s;mall fi&s;h for their own u&s;e.</P>
<P>The crown, in laying a moderate duty on the fi&s;h|garth or wear, formerly made upon the river near Gur|jef,
<PB N="183" REF="188">
had confined the fi&s;heries to the Jaikian Co&s;&s;acks; but, they having demoli&s;hed that garth and erected another at the further end of their city, which &s;tops the pa&s;&s;age of the whole river, the fi&s;h from the Ca&s;|pian &s;ea can come no higher up than Jaizkoi Goro|dok.</P>
<P>I will now proceed to give my readers &s;ome accouht of the&s;e fi&s;heries. The kinds of fi&s;h caught in this river, are the horn-fi&s;h, &s;turgeon, &s;had, barbel, bream, &s;almon, and a variety of &s;mall fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Of all the wandering fi&s;h, the fir&s;t that comes up the river is the white &s;almon, and that in February. They are caught beneath the ice by hooks, baited with pieces of fi&s;h. In March, April and May, the &s;everal kinds of &s;turgeon &s;hoot their way from the &s;ea, and &s;wim up the Jaik, in &s;hoals. I have been well in|formed, that at certain &s;ea&s;ons, they place cannon on the banks of the river near the wear, at Jaizkoi Goro|dok, load them with powder only, and fire often into the water to repel the impetuo&s;ity of tho&s;e va&s;t &s;hoals of large fi&s;h, that would otherwi&s;e break the wear, that cro&s;&s;es the river. They &s;ay, and it is very probable, that the &s;turgeon comes up into the river in the month of April, when the willow buds, to &s;pawn, and that they rub them&s;elves upon the &s;tony ground to get rid of their roe; though, as I have ob&s;erved before, young &s;turgeons are never caught. From a conviction that
<PB N="184" REF="189">
the Ru&s;&s;ia &s;turgeon and horn-fi&s;h, pa&s;s the winter in this river, they have a law that obliges them to throw all they catch, into the water again, becau&s;e, when re-caught in winter, and tran&s;ported in a frozen &s;tate, they fetch a greater price, and thus contribute to the public intere&s;t. And they enforce this law &s;o &s;trictly, as con&s;tantly to deprive him that breaks it, of all his fi&s;h-provi&s;ion, and whip him into the bargain.</P>
<P>It is chiefly &s;turgeons and bjelugas that are caught with hooks, in January. The&s;e fi&s;hes are &s;aid to lay them&s;elves in rows, in deep parts of the river, towards the latter end of autumn, and &s;o pa&s;s the winter in a certain &s;tate of re&s;t, though not without motion or &s;en&s;ibility. Now, as the river Jaik, from it's &s;andy bed, is continually changing it's depth, owing to the inundations in &s;pring, that wa&s;h away the banks be|neath the water, it is uncertain in what &s;pots the fi&s;h lie. On this account, in autumn, when the ice be|gins to form it&s;elf, the Co&s;&s;acks will watch the moti|ons of the&s;e fi&s;hes; for it is &s;aid, that before they lay them&s;elves up, they play &s;ome time upon the &s;urface of the water, and leap &s;everal times over tho&s;e &s;pots where they mean to winter. Others go out upon the ice, as &s;oon as the river is frozen, and lay down on tho&s;e &s;pots where the water is cleare&s;t, and will tell you, that by putting a cloth over their heads, they can &s;ee the fi&s;h lying at the bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="190">When the time of the hook-fi&s;hing is come, which is commonly on the third or fourth of January, a general a&s;&s;embly of the people is held, when it is a&s;ked about, whether the ab&s;ent Co&s;&s;acks are returned; an enquiry, al&s;o, is made in what places the fi&s;h is &s;uppo&s;ed to lie, and finally, what day is fixed to begin fi&s;hing. In this and other fi&s;heries, with an intent to keep order, they elect an ataman or chief, from the &s;tarchins, under who&s;e command they choo&s;e &s;ome elders and an adju|tant, as conductors of the re&s;t: but the inferior Co&s;|&s;acks join as it were in partner&s;hip, five or &s;ix together. Every thing is prepared before the day fixed, and care is taken to have good &s;harp hooks and poles of various lengths on which the hooks are fa&s;tened. Before the fi&s;hing day arrives, every Co&s;&s;ack enli&s;ted, though not on duty on the lines, receives a written licence, &s;ealed with the regency-&s;eal. A Co&s;&s;ack that has &s;erved his year, or one that has not yet &s;erved, may procure a li|cence to fi&s;h, by getting him&s;elf regi&s;tered. No per&s;on can have more than one of the&s;e written licences, except the members of the regency, who have &s;ome exclu&s;ive privileges. The ataman, or chief, is entitled to four, the &s;tarchin to three, and the inferior officers to two licen|ces each. The clerks have only one licence granted to two, and every re&s;ident prie&s;t has one. Tho&s;e who have the&s;e licences can &s;ell them, which enables many, who have no claim to a licence, to purcha&s;e one.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="191">On the day appointed, all tho&s;e Co&s;&s;acks who have written powers, a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves with &s;ledges, and every nece&s;&s;ary implement before &s;un-ri&s;e, in a certain place, before the town, and range them&s;elves into a line, in the &s;ame order in which they reach the ground. Here they are received by the ataman, elected for the fi&s;hery, and care is taken, that every Co&s;&s;ack has a firelock, in order to defend them&s;elves again&s;t any at|tack made on them by the Kirgui&s;ians. This done, two officers exhort the people to behave orderly and quietly, and as &s;oon as day begins, a &s;ignal is given from the town, by the firing of two pieces of cannon; upon which, every one ha&s;tens, as quick as his hor&s;e can carry him, to the di&s;trict appointed for the fi&s;hery, in order to choo&s;e the mo&s;t advantageous &s;pot. Yet no one dares begin to open the ice, till every one has taken his place, and the ataman has fired a gun or two, by way of &s;ignal to begin.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t notice here, that the river is divided into two parts, one for the &s;pring and autumn-fi&s;hing, and the other for the hook-fi&s;hing, alone. The latter be|gins ju&s;t beyond the town, and continues to the di&s;|tance of 300 miles; and from thence to the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, the river remains undi&s;turbed, till the net-fi&s;hing comes on. At fir&s;t &s;etting off, they fi&s;h only one day, to enable the poorer Co&s;&s;acks to purcha&s;e with the gain of that day, provi&s;ions, and other nece&s;&s;ary things. Five or &s;ix days after, the great fi&s;hery begins, and
<PB N="187" REF="192">
la&s;ts for nine days, fi&s;hing about twenty miles of the river each day. Each day the Co&s;&s;acks ha&s;ten to the &s;pot, where they are to begin, before dawn, and there wait for the &s;ignal of the ataman.</P>
<P>Every man makes, on the &s;pot where he means to fi&s;h, a moderately round opening in the ice. One may fi&s;h as near another as he plea&s;es, but no one can have two openings, at a time; yet, when he leaves one opening he may make another, and a &s;econd may oc|cupy the &s;pot he left. By frequent changings and tri|als, they will fi&s;h in the cour&s;e of the day the whole di&s;trict, appointed for that day's fi&s;hery. Where the places are not very deep, they u&s;e hooks, with &s;hort poles. The pole, with the hook on it, is put down to the bottom of the river, and as the di&s;turbed fi&s;h ri&s;e, they draw up the pole, and hook the fi&s;h. This done, they bring it within reach of a &s;hort hook, which they have in their other hand, and with which they hook the fi&s;h afre&s;h, and pull it up upon the ice. If two men hook the &s;ame fi&s;h, it is divided between them, and if one has not &s;trength enough to pull a fi&s;h out, he calls his next neighbour to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and the fi&s;h is divided. One man &s;hall have &s;ometimes the good-luck to hook ten or twelve large fi&s;hes in a day, when another &s;hall not be able to catch an equal number in the whole month, perhaps not &s;ufficient to pay his expences. A man commonly makes a vow before he leaves the town, to give the fir&s;t fi&s;h he hooks, or perhaps more, to the
<PB N="188" REF="193">
church, on condition fortune favours him. And they are &s;uper&s;ticious enough to believe, that in ca&s;e they hook a frog, (of which there are &s;ome of very enormous &s;ize in this river); the per&s;on to whom this di&s;a&s;ter hap|pens, if he ever changes his &s;pot or hooks, will not catch a fi&s;h the whole winter.</P>
<P>The &s;econd great fi&s;hery is in the &s;pring, for the fi&s;h Sewrjug. As &s;oon, in the month of May, as accounts arrive from Gurjef, &s;ent by the Co&s;&s;acks quartered there, to watch for the &s;aid fi&s;h, that it makes it's appearance in the mouth of the river Jaik, they pre|pare every thing to catch it. The &s;ame orders and ceremonies are ob&s;erved, as in the winter. An ata|man is cho&s;en, whom every one, who has a written power, is bound to obey. A certain di&s;trict is &s;et out for the fi&s;hing, by a rope drawn acro&s;s the river, which no one is to pa&s;s. This fi&s;hery la&s;t only three days, as the &s;ewrjugs, when di&s;turbed, return into the &s;ea. The la&s;t fi&s;hery is commonly fini&s;hed in one day. This is carried on at the mouth of the river, and begins with the u&s;ual ceremonies, as before, at day-break, each en|deavouring at a &s;ignal given, to out-row the other, be|fore the nets are &s;pread, for every one who fi&s;hes, has a boat and net to him&s;elf. The&s;e boats are made of the trunks of black and white poplar, (no other tree here being of &s;ufficient diameter, for the purpo&s;e,) tanned on the out&s;ide with the a&s;phaltos, which I have already mentioned, and which is found here in abund|ance.

This fi&s;hing la&s;ts commonly for two hours, and when over, the fi&s;hermen flock to the chief to deliver their fi&s;h, and receive their reward.

Every gang &s;truggles, to get fir&s;t, and they often fight; they beat and knock one ano|ther about; oars are broken, boats are &s;plit, and very often a part of the combatants are tumbled into the river, and peri&s;h.

<P>'The river Wolga,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>

it's channel &s;o infinite a number of rivers and &s;treams, that when the&s;e are encrea&s;ed by the melting of the &s;nows, the waters ri&s;e above their u&s;ual level, and not only overflow the low i&s;lands in the river, &s;o as that &s;hips pa&s;s over them, but all the plains that lie on each &s;ide the river are &s;o overwhelmed, that nothing but the tops of the highe&s;t trees appear above the &s;urface of the water; and when the water leaves the&s;e plains, the land is in the highe&s;t &s;tate of richne&s;s and fertility. But on account of it's numerous windings, angles, flats, i&s;les, &s;helves and &s;and-banks, the mo&s;t expe|rienced &s;ailors are kept in continual alarm. It is only in the months of May and June that large ve&s;&s;els &s;ail on it with &s;ecurity and ea&s;e, when the waters are &s;wel|led as I have mentioned. The wide&s;t part of this river is between Tzaritzin and A&s;trachan. At A&s;tra|chan it is 2200 feet over, at Tzaritzin about three-fourths of a mile, and it divides it&s;elf into a greater number of branches than any known river in the world. At A&s;trachan the river ri&s;es or &s;wells about &s;ix feet, at Tzaritzin higher, and the flats and and vallies all round are &s;o entirely deluged that they have the appearance of a large ocean, and the hares and field|mice are de&s;troyed by thou&s;ands. The animals of a larger kind, &s;uch as wolves, foxes, wild-bores, &amp;c. have, probably, a <HI>pre&s;entiment</HI> of the approaching flood, as they take their flight to the inland &s;teps; but, when the high waters take the hares by &s;urprize, &s;o as entirely to &s;urround them, they &s;eek a refuge on
<PB N="193" REF="199">
the higher lands, and when the inundation reaches tho&s;e al&s;o, there is &s;carcely one that can e&s;cape: if the water does not by chance reach them, the hunters do, and the&s;e take them, with their hands, alive. Rats and mice will, &s;ometimes, take the re&s;olution to e&s;cape by &s;wimming, and de&s;perately &s;trike, in troops, for the Wolga it&s;elf, in order to gain it's high we&s;tern &s;hore, and in doing this will &s;wim upwards of two miles, and peri&s;h at la&s;t; others take to the trees, where birds of prey wait their coming, and the bjeluga will &s;hake the &s;maller trees with it's tail, tumble them down and devour them alive; &s;o will they the young crows that have not learnt to fly. The mouth of this river, at A&s;trachan, is full of ru&s;hes, and is a harbour for wild boars, who feed upon the rats that dwell among them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The fi&s;heries in this river, though very profitable, are often attended with great danger, for when a &s;outh-wind ri&s;es, the waves of the &s;ea flow towards the mouth and violently rai&s;e the ice. If then a &s;trong wind from the &s;outh, north-we&s;t or ea&s;t, &s;hould &s;ud|denly &s;ucceed, it cau&s;es a reflux of the water towards the &s;ea; the ice ru&s;hes on and often breaks into pieces of enormous magnitude. Pieces will drive out to &s;ea containing fifteen or twenty &s;quare miles. When this happens, all the fi&s;hermen that are on it, are &s;oon &s;wallowed up and lo&s;t.</Q></P>

<Q>In the&s;e cruel circum&s;tances, as &s;oon as the unfor|tunate wretches perceive them&s;elves disjointed from the &s;hore, they keep a look-out, to ob&s;erve towards what point they are driven by the waves. If they find they are floating to the open &s;ea, they &s;tand in the &s;ame place immoveable as &s;tatues, waiting the dreadful deci&s;ion of their fate; but if there remains any hope of reaching land, they leap upon the hor&s;es they u&s;ually take with them for drawing the fi&s;h, and gallop full &s;peed towards the leeward &s;ide, hoping the piece of ice, in it's pa&s;&s;age, will come in contact with the &s;hore, and give them an opportunity of leaping on the land in the moment of contact. If they lo&s;e this moment, the ice repelled with violence towards the &s;ea, will &s;oon go to pieces by the agitation of the waves, and their de&s;truction is more certain than ever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is natural to imagine that a &s;tate of life &s;o full of danger, will be followed only by people already re|duced to the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of mi&s;ery, and who have often merited the la&s;t inflictions of civil ju&s;tice by their delinquencies. From the time they embrace this calling, they are fixed in a perpetual bondage, by the advances their nece&s;&s;ities oblige them to accept of their employers, who frequently take advantage of this circum&s;tance to &s;ubject them to the mo&s;t cruel inju&s;tice; though they only are gainers by their toil, growing rich by their mi&s;eries, whil&s;t the

<P>The&s;e fi&s;heries ended, the Co&s;&s;acks proceed to other bu&s;ine&s;s. They travel to purcha&s;e bread in the di&s;tricts of the Wolga and Samara, and towards the latter end of &s;ummer, cut and make their hay.</P>
<P>During the hook-fi&s;hing, a great many buyers come here from the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. Sturgeons caught in winter, are &s;old to the&s;e buyers as they are caught, who dre&s;s the fi&s;h and roe, barrel it and tran&s;port it frozen. Ten good &s;izable &s;turgeons will &s;ell for from thirty to forty-five rubles, each ruble 4s. 6d. but a large &s;turgeon, even without a roe, will fetch &s;ix or &s;even rubles. The large&s;t bjeluga &s;turgeon caught in the river Jaik, will weigh above 1000 lb. and yield 200 lb. of roe, or cavear. The &s;turgeons here are about &s;even feet long, and weigh about 200 lb. but the &s;pawners are generally the large&s;t, and will yield &s;ometimes 36 lb. weight of roe, and are &s;old, at the fir&s;t hand, for two rubles. A few years ago, they found a great part of the roe in an old bjeluga petrified, though the bjeluga-&s;tone, which is the petrified roe, is very &s;carce indeed.</P>
<P>'This &s;tone,' &s;ays Mr. <HI>Sokolof,</HI> who vi&s;ited the Ca&s;|pian fi&s;heries,
<Q>is found lying lengthways under the cartilages of the back, in the part where the kidneys
<PB N="196" REF="202">
of other animals are. The in&s;tant it is taken from the fi&s;h, it is &s;oft and moi&s;t, but quickly hardens in the air. It's &s;ize never exceeds that of a hen's egg; it is &s;ometimes oval and &s;ometimes a little flatted or bent towards the place where it is fa&s;tened to the back. It may be &s;craped with a knife, but with dif|ficulty, and does not ferment when mixed with acids. Though it has little merit, it holds a con&s;iderable rank among the dome&s;tic remedies of the Ru&s;&s;ians, who admini&s;ter the &s;crapings in &s;mall do&s;es, mixed with water, in difficult labours, in the di&s;ea&s;es of children, and again&s;t &s;toppages in the urinary pa&s;|&s;ages. The value of a &s;tone is a ruble.</Q></P>
<P>The fre&s;h roe, being &s;oftly worked with the hand, through a coar&s;e &s;ieve, is thus cleaned, and as in this &s;outhern clime, the mild weather begins &s;oon after new-year's day, they &s;alt it to prevent it's &s;poiling. It is afterwards pre&s;&s;ed down in barrels with the feet, and conveyed to very di&s;tant parts.</P>
<P>They al&s;o dry the back &s;inews of the Sewrjug &s;tur|geon, make them up in bundles of twenty-five each, and &s;ell them for food, at the rate of three or four rubles a thou&s;and; and as they hold every part of the &s;turgeon to be eatable, they pre&s;erve the &s;tomach of it, and eat it as a dainty. But the mo&s;t valuable part of this fi&s;h is it's bladder. Tho&s;e merchants who buy the whole fi&s;h, commonly &s;ell back the bladder to the Co&s;&s;acks,
<PB N="197" REF="203">
who make i&s;ingla&s;s from it, which is done here in one way only. As the bladder is taken fre&s;h from the fi&s;h, they wa&s;h and &s;pread it in the air to dry, then divide the inner &s;kin, or white &s;kin, which is the i&s;ingla&s;s, from the outer; wrap it up in a moi&s;t cloth to make it pliable, and then roll it up and pinch it into the form of a &s;er|pent or a heart, and let it dry again in the &s;hade. This is &s;old at different prices, according to what fi&s;h it is taken from, from twelve to forty rubles per pud, each pud 36 pounds Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Salt is al&s;o a very con&s;iderable article in the Jaikian fi&s;heries. The Co&s;&s;acks have liberty to provide them|&s;elves with a &s;ufficient quantity to &s;alt their fi&s;h and roe, which are conveyed into Ru&s;&s;ia, and u&s;e many thou|&s;and puds for this purpo&s;e. Indeed the &s;teps or heaths about this river are &s;o abundantly provided, by nature, with this mineral trea&s;ure, that the inhabitants will ne|ver want it. They once fetched this &s;alt in &s;ummer-time, for the u&s;e of the town, from the di&s;tance of &s;eventy miles, with an e&s;cort of 200 armed men; but at pre&s;ent they have it from the &s;ea-&s;ide. Their provi|&s;ions, when &s;alted, are kept, in all the guard-&s;tations, in pits made in the ground, or in tubs covered with mats and clay.</P>
<P>The Jaikian Co&s;&s;acks know nothing of agriculture, perhaps the defence of their forts leaves them no time for hu&s;bandry, or, as they ju&s;tly remark, the too great
<PB N="198" REF="204">
&s;altne&s;s of the land will not allow it. I think the Bu|charian millet would grow here. This plant pro&s;pers, with &s;ome care, exceedingly well among the A&s;iatic nations, on a &s;oil and in a climate &s;imilar to this. It is the only kind of corn the Bucharians have, and the high and thick &s;talks of this plant &s;erve the inhabitants of tho&s;e woodle&s;s countries for firing. It is no wonder, therefore, that the Bucharians &s;hould cultivate it, and have a &s;olemn and univer&s;al fea&s;t at &s;eed-time. A &s;ingle plant will often yield two pounds weight of mil|let. Tobacco might al&s;o be planted here with &s;ucce&s;s, if the Co&s;&s;acks did not abhor it, from &s;ome religious prejudice.</P>
<P>They are here great lovers of the water-melon, and rai&s;e great quantities of them, be&s;ides all &s;orts of ve|getables for the kitchen. There is not le&s;s than fifty large water-melon gardens, in and about this town, Jaizkoi Gorodok, the fruit of which is &s;old for a trifle. The&s;e gardens are divided into long fields, enclo&s;ed only with a hedge, and to all parts of the&s;e gardens, they conduct the water in the manner of the ea&s;tern na|tions, in clay trenches, in order to water the plants &s;uf|ficiently. Of cour&s;e, the&s;e gardens are always near &s;ome flowing or &s;tanding water, where they rai&s;e the water by a water-gallows.

<P><PB N="199" REF="205">Jaizkoi Gorodok, owing to it's high and open &s;itua|tion, is a healthy town, and the people know no other di&s;orders than &s;uch as proceed from their way of life and a certain contagion of lu&s;t, which is a univer&s;al and common di&s;order. All the inhabitants are &s;trong, robu&s;t and of a large &s;ize, not excepting the women; and this lu&s;t-di&s;order, is a kind of lepro&s;y, little known in Europe, but general along the di&s;tricts of the river Jaik. It is the &s;ame di&s;order known in A&s;trachan by the name of the Crimean &s;ickne&s;s, brought from the Crimea, in former campaigns. The Jaikian Co&s;&s;acks a&s;&s;ured me, that it was brought to A&s;trachan by a regiment that &s;erved in a Per&s;ian war. They call it the black di&s;temper, one of it's fir&s;t &s;ymptoms being a livid colour that covers the face. I &s;aw &s;everal per|&s;ons labouring under it to the highe&s;t degree. The pa|tient &s;uffers with it four or five years, before it attains it's height, and they &s;ay it is in the &s;eventh year only that it proves mortal. It does not infect all per&s;ons who attend the &s;ick, at lea&s;t not during the four years. I have &s;een a family in Jaizkoi Gorodok, where the elde&s;t brother was fir&s;t afflicted with it; three years after, the younge&s;t brother caught it, and one year after this, the mother, and yet the wives of both, who cohabited with their re&s;pective hu&s;bands all the time, were free and clear from it. It &s;eizes chiefly the robu&s;t and per|&s;ons of middle age. The fir&s;t and &s;econd year, the pa|tient feels no particular pain, nor is &s;en&s;ible of any weakne&s;s. His face looks blue, as if he was choaked,
<PB N="200" REF="206">
and this is followed with a number of blue-red &s;pots or blotches on the wri&s;t, &s;ides and face, which occa&s;ions an extreme roughne&s;s of the &s;kin in tho&s;e places, or &s;curf, called, in medicine, <HI>impetigo.</HI> Some have no &s;pots at all in their faces, for the fir&s;t year, but a few &s;mall ones about their joints. In the beginning of this di&s;|temper, patients are &s;omewhat feveri&s;h, but after two years, they all &s;uffer the &s;marte&s;t pain in their limbs and joints, begin to lo&s;e their appetite, &s;trength and coun|tenance, and become very faint. At this period, the lepro&s;y is more virulent and &s;preads it&s;elf all over the body, not in thick and deep-red &s;pots, but in flat and &s;cabby blotches, which exulcerate by degrees and leave a bad &s;curf, continuing longer than any &s;i|milar irruption. When the &s;curf drys away, the parts itch, and the &s;kin underneath the &s;curf naturally heals, but if the patient &s;cratches it or picks off the &s;cab, it is followed by an increa&s;ing, angry boil, that will pene|trate even to the bone. When this happens in the fingers, it de&s;troys them quite, and they will fall away, joint by joint. The legs are commonly mo&s;t covered with &s;pots, but, by degrees, no part of the body is free from them, except the palms of the hands, the in&s;ide of the joints of the arms, the arm-pits, the back-&s;ide and knuckle-joints. The&s;e parts, even in the mo&s;t de|&s;perate &s;tate of the di&s;temper, are always clear as at other times, as is al&s;o that part of the head on which the hair grows. Tho&s;e with whom the di&s;temper con|tinues to the &s;eventh or eighth year, have their no&s;trils,
<PB N="201" REF="207">
the in&s;ide of the mouth and throat and windpipe exul|cerated, and it is probable that the inward and more noble parts are infected with boils e're the di&s;temper proves mortal. Yet in it's la&s;t period, it affects the con&s;titution and &s;trength le&s;s than one &s;hould expect, for the pains are commonly tolerable and the natural functions go on regularly. It does not appear that the patient, as in other leprous di&s;orders, feels an uncom|mon lu&s;tful de&s;ire; this appetite they lo&s;e gradually; nor do they lo&s;e their hair, except on the eye-brows, which are always itching, and on the exulcerated parts. It is &s;aid, that this di&s;order is cured in Crimean Tar|tary by a decoction of the plant <HI>anba&s;is aphylla,</HI> which grows there and al&s;o about the river Jaik. I doubt much whether mercury would radically cure it. At Orenburg, they &s;alivated a Co&s;&s;ack afflicted with it, in it's middle period; he lo&s;t much blood, and afterwards &s;eemed better; but, being &s;uffered to return to his for|mer diet and way of living, the lepro&s;y returned and raged with redoubled violence. Mercurial lotions ex|ternally applied and antimonials taken internally, would, probably, be a better treatment, but &s;uch ex|periments require the &s;kill of able phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>By way of clo&s;ing this account of Jaizkoi Gorodok, I will mention &s;ome of their mo&s;t common and pernici|ous in&s;ects, which are moths or tarakans, and crickets; they have al&s;o a large kind of wandering field-rat. (The &s;urmulet of Buffon). I no where met with &s;o many

crickets as in this place, owing partly to the warm and dry &s;ituation of the town, and partly to a bad cu&s;tom the people have, of &s;tuffing the &s;eams of their hou&s;es be|tween the beams, with fine hay, having no mo&s;s for that purpo&s;e, and the&s;e in&s;ects liking to take up their abode in this hay.

<P><Q>According to <HI>Albulga&s;i,</HI> indeed, they are a branch of the Mongols, who, in very remote ages, wandered about the de&s;arts, on both &s;ides of the mountains that divide Dauria from the pre&s;ent Chine&s;e Mongalia and the &s;outhern parts of the Sayane-hills. Long be|fore the end of the twelfth century, they were &s;epa|rated into three branches under the denomination of Mongols, Oirats and Burats; <HI>T&s;chingis Khan,</HI> who lived about 1300, united them under one monarchy, became their &s;overeign and made their &s;everal princes tributary to him. He conquered China and &s;ubdued the Tartars.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When the Mongols were driven out of China, in 1368, the united Mongol and Tartar Hordes, after &s;ubduing their we&s;tern neighbours, &s;pread into Ru&s;&s;ia and other parts of Europe, and there formed new colonies. Under the de&s;cendant of <HI>T&s;chingis,</HI> the princes divided again, and thus, with the addition of Ru&s;&s;ian conque&s;ts, the va&s;t Mongol-Thibetan empire was entirely disjointed in the &s;ixteenth century. From this di&s;per&s;ion of the people aro&s;e the pre&s;ent Mongol and Tartar nations. <HI>T&s;chingis Khan</HI> and <HI>Timur Bek,</HI> who attacked China and wre&s;ted it out of the hands of the founder of the new dyna&s;ty of Ming, &s;prung from one and the &s;ame ance&s;tor.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="210">Of the three branches, the Mongols, the Burats and the Oirats, I &s;hall &s;peak but of the latter, who are commonly called Kalmucks.</P>
<P>'The&s;e de&s;arts,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>
<Q>which the Kalmucks inhabit, lie between the Don and the Wolga, and on the river Ural from Irgis to the Ca&s;pian &s;ea. They con&s;i&s;t of a &s;tony loam, are quite burnt up, de&s;titute of wood, abound in &s;alt, contain many fre&s;h-water lakes, as well as &s;alt lakes, and produce whole&s;ome herbage, which makes their cattle vigorous and fat.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The pre&s;ent Kalmucks are of three tribes. Tor|gouts, Sjungorians and Derbets, and con&s;i&s;t of about 20,000 families, dividing them&s;elves into three ranks, the nobility, whom they call <HI>white-bones;</HI> the common people, who are bondmen, whom they di&s;|tingui&s;h by the name of <HI>black-bones;</HI> and, the clergy, who are de&s;cended from both ranks, and are freemen. The noble ladies are called <HI>white-fle&s;h,</HI> the common women <HI>black-fle&s;h.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I &s;pell the word Kalmuck agreeable to the Ru&s;&s;ian pronunciation; but, according to it's true etimology, I &s;hould have written it <HI>Chalmack</HI> or <HI>Chalimack,</HI> this be|ing the name the Tartars give the Kalmucks: Chali|mack, in the Tartarian language, &s;ignifies revolted. But &s;ome Kalmucks give another derivation, from their own language, and &s;ay it is compo&s;ed of the words
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="211">
<HEAD>KALMUCKS.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="205" REF="212">
<HI>Gal,</HI> which, in the Kalmuck and Mongalian language, means fire, and <HI>aimak,</HI> which implies a tribe, or a divi|&s;ion of the Ulu&s;&s;es, and thus means <HI>couragious;</HI> in the &s;ame manner their brethren, the Mongalians, derive their name from <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Gal.</HI> The different races of Kalmucks, however, give them&s;elves univer&s;ally the name of <HI>Eljud</HI> or <HI>Oljud.</HI></P>
<P>The Kalmucks are, in general, middle-&s;ized men, though there are more &s;hort than tall. They are all well-made, and I do not recollect ever &s;eeing one maimed or deformed. The education of their children, while infants, which they leave &s;olely to nature, mu&s;t give them healthy and perfect bodies, though they are &s;lender and their limbs &s;light. I never &s;aw a fat, corpulent Kalmuck, at lea&s;t among the common men; though among the Kirgui&s;ians and Ba&s;kirs, who live quite in the &s;ame manner, many are often very bulky and corpulent. The complexion of their face and body is tolerably white, but their infants are quite &s;o. It be|ing a cu&s;tom, among the common people, to let their children run about &s;tark naked in the burning &s;un and the &s;moke of their felt-tents, and even grown per&s;ons &s;leeping quite naked, it changes their natural complex|ion to a yellow-brown; but this is not &s;o vi&s;ible in the women. Among their ladies of di&s;tinction, are &s;een &s;ome very white faces, and the&s;e appear more &s;o from the blackne&s;s of their hair. In this, as well as in the
<PB N="206" REF="213">
features of their faces, they are perfectly like the wo|men of China.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe the common features of the Kalmuck men, they being &s;ufficiently known. <HI>Tooke</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>They are, for the mo&s;t part, raw-boned and &s;tout; their vi&s;age is &s;o flat that the &s;kull of a Kalmuck may ea&s;ily be known from that of any other man. The eyes too are &s;maller and the corners of them flatter than among the Europeans; they have thick lips, a &s;mall no&s;e and a &s;hort chin, and their beard is &s;canty and appears late. Their teeth are even and white, their complexion a reddi&s;h-brown, and their knees always &s;tand outwards, like a bow, which proceeds from their manner of &s;itting on their ancles and their being almo&s;t con&s;tantly on hor&s;e-back. The women are of the &s;ame &s;hape and make with the men, only that their complexion is very clear and of a whole&s;ome white and red.</Q>
According to &s;ome tra|vellers, one might be led to &s;uppo&s;e, that all the faces of the Kalmucks are deformed and frightful, but this is not the ca&s;e. There are, among both &s;exes, many round and plea&s;ant faces, &s;ome who&s;e features are &s;o re|gular, that they would not want admirers in any Euro|pean city; though it &s;eems a characteri&s;tic of this people, that the corners of their eyes and eye-brows have a &s;lant direction, and the bridge of their no&s;es are &s;hort and flat. I found, that the D&s;ungorians were gene|rally taller and had a prettier vi&s;age than the Torgouts,
<PB N="207" REF="214">
the former having, probably, received a greater mix|ture of Tartarian blood, by the rape of the women be|longing to this latter nation. As to the blackne&s;s of their hair, with which their children are born, I did not &s;ee among the Kalmucks, a &s;ingle exception, nor the lea&s;t degeneration into a brown colour. Full-grown men have a &s;trong and large beard, but they leave only a whi&s;ker turned up on their upper lip, and a tuft upon their under one. Old per&s;ons, and e&s;peci|ally prie&s;ts, leave a whi&s;ker and let the hair grow over the corners of the mouth, on the lower lip, underneath the chin and about the neck. The re&s;t of the face is kept clear, by plucking it, and cutting it with &s;izzars and rough knives. The Kalmucks, al&s;o, like the Tartars, accu&s;tom them&s;elves in this manner to extir|pate the hair from other parts of the body.</P>
<P>Having now &s;poken of their per&s;ons, I will proceed to their minds, in which I &s;hall have an opportunity to be more favourable in many points than travellers in gene|ral have been. In this re&s;pect, they are far before other Nomades or &s;hepherd-nations. The &s;ocialne&s;s, ho&s;pitality, candor, officiou&s;ne&s;s and a certain gaiety which never leaves a Kalmuck, but di&s;tingui&s;hes him from the more phlegmatic Kirgui&s;ian, may be called good qualifications, but their idlene&s;s, want of cleanli|ne&s;s and knavery, which they too often mi&s;employ, are ju&s;tly to be deemed their principal vices: a love of idlene&s;s is common and natural to all nations who
<PB N="208" REF="215">
lead an unlimited, carele&s;s and pa&s;toral life; yet the Kalmucks have le&s;s of it, owing to their &s;prightline&s;s. But their filthine&s;s or na&s;tine&s;s can no way be contra|dicted or excu&s;ed, and, perhaps, is to be a&s;cribed, as in the lower cla&s;&s;es of the French, more to their educa|tion and volatility than to &s;loth; for the Kalmuck wo|men, perform their dome&s;tic offices, with great indu&s;|try, and are, therefore, much courted and coveted by the Kirgue&s;es. As to their mental faculties, their knowledge is certainly much limited, but, in &s;pite of all their ignorance, they have a very good, quick and natural under&s;tanding, which might be very ea&s;ily cul|tivated and improved, if their way of living and natu|ral &s;prightline&s;s were not in&s;uperable ob&s;tacles. Though generally cholerick, they live more friendly together, than one &s;hould expect from their mode of living. Among them&s;elves they are &s;ocial and ho&s;pitable; they like to &s;hare every thing that can be enjoyed, and never keep any thing to them&s;elves alone. When eating, drinking, or &s;moking tobacco, every one pre&s;ent mu&s;t be a partaker; and if, for example, there &s;hould be but one tobacco-pipe, they mu&s;t all u&s;e it by turns. If one is pre&s;ented with tobacco, fruit, or other eat|ables, he will divide it with his friends or tho&s;e who are next him. If a family has made a provi&s;ion of milk to make brandy of, they will call in their neighbours to help to con&s;ume this ble&s;&s;ing. But this liberality mo&s;tly extends it&s;elf to eatables, for they never part with any of their property. However thievi&s;hly in|clined
<PB N="209" REF="216">
they may have been de&s;cribed, yet they never &s;teal any thing from their countrymen, unle&s;s there be ho&s;tilities among the Ulu&s;&s;es. Indeed, mo&s;t of the robberies with which they have been charged, ari&s;e from ho&s;tility or a &s;pirit of revenge, but this is not done by violence, but craft. I have been told, that the&s;e Ulu&s;&s;es, who, formerly, were under the government of <HI>Na&s;armamut,</HI> but now under <HI>Bambar,</HI> one of his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, a per&s;on renowned for his warlike di&s;po&s;ition, have always been famous for robbery, but, that among all other Ulu&s;&s;es, if the lea&s;t care is taken of their pro|perty, no &s;uch attempts are made.</P>
<P>As the Kalmucks know not how to make any &s;ort of &s;tuff for cloathing, they are obliged to buy it all. The common people &s;eldom wear any thing but &s;heep and other &s;kins, and felts, which they throw over them in the rain, by way of cloak. The better cla&s;s of men wear an upper-garment, like that worn by the Poles, except the &s;leeves which are clo&s;e and narrow, and an under|garment, buttoned all the way down and bound clo&s;e to the body with a girdle. Tho&s;e of di&s;tinction wear a &s;hort &s;hirt under it, open before, and wide breeches, made of linen, which reach down and are fa&s;tened into the bu&s;kins. The poor do without a &s;hirt, and are not le&s;s gay in their narrow coat or fur, which they fa&s;ten round them with a girdle.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="217">The upper-garment and boots of the women, differ but little from tho&s;e of the men, only that their cloaks are lighter made and of better &s;tuff, a little longer and more elegant and lighter about the arms. Tho&s;e who are ladies of di&s;tinction, wear over the under-garment or <HI>be&s;chmet,</HI> a rich and long floating wai&s;tcoat, without &s;leeves, and hang the upper-garment, or fur, upon one or both &s;houlders. As the women have their under|garment and &s;hirt open before, they can uncover their bo&s;om to the girdle, and always do, in the &s;ummer-&s;ea&s;on, when they mean to be well dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The women would be &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hed from the men, if it was not for their head-dre&s;s, and in this, married women differ from the maidens. The heads of the men are commonly clipt clo&s;e, leaving only a long tuft of hair behind, in the centre of the crown, which tho&s;e of di&s;tinction generally braid into two or three tre&s;&s;es. The Torgouts wear, both &s;ummer and winter, a &s;mall round cap, bordered with fur. The Sjungori|ans commonly wear a &s;ummer hat, covered with felt, ju&s;t like tho&s;e of the Chine&s;e, except it's being &s;maller and having a flatter brim. All wear, upon the crown, a large &s;preading fringe, which hangs down under the cap. A Kalmuck's ears, like tho&s;e of the Tartars, &s;tand at a di&s;tance from his head, and the cap comes down to the root of the ears. This prominence of ear is more vi&s;ible in the Kalmucks than the Tartars, the ears of the former being rather larger.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="218">Boys hair is &s;horn from their infancy, but the wo|men do not like to have their hair cut; girls run about like furies with bewildered locks; but at the age of ten or twelve, when a Kalmuck lady is marriageable, her hair is plaited in as many tre&s;&s;es as &s;he plea&s;es, and wound round the head. When a girl, however, is married, the&s;e tre&s;&s;es are undone, and the hair is braid|ed into two large ones only, which hang down in tails over both &s;houlders. The ordinary cla&s;s of women, whil&s;t at work, put theirs into a linen bag. The caps of wives and maidens are partly the &s;ame, except that the lower cla&s;s wear them only when they go out or are well-dre&s;&s;ed. It is a round, flat cap, bordered with fur and covers only the upper part of the head. Women of di&s;tinction wear higher caps of a richer, &s;ilk &s;tuff, with a broad brim, cocked up before and behind, and lined with black velvet. They &s;eem fond of &s;preading, on the top of their caps, a broad fringe, that hangs down on all &s;ides. Such a cap they call <HI>chalban,</HI> the common ones <HI>maihalhu.</HI> All the women wear ear|rings.
<Q>Some maidens are &s;illy enough to &s;mear their faces with red and white paint, and &s;ome women will wear a large, gold ring in their no&s;trils.</Q></P>
<P>Kalmuck dwellings are like tho&s;e huts made of felts, common in all A&s;iatic nomades, and very well known in Ru&s;&s;ia. They are called <HI>Jourts,</HI> the truly ingenious &s;tructure of which I will endeavour to de&s;cribe, for the entertainment of my foreign readers, more circum&s;tan|tially
<PB N="212" REF="219">
than has hitherto been done. (See the plate of Kalmucks removing, which repre&s;ents one Kalmuck tent on the out&s;ide and the &s;ection of another). The &s;keleton of tho&s;e felt-huts con&s;i&s;ts fir&s;t of wattled hur|dles, formed thirty inches thick, by &s;even or eight dif|ferent pieces, &s;even feet long and five broad, placed one upon another and fa&s;tened together in a kind of pannel with willow rods; &s;everal of the&s;e pannels are &s;et up in a circular form and joined at the ends with hair-ropes, or bands, forming the circumference of the tent. The door is made in the &s;ame manner but not &s;o thick, and ornamented with a border; ropes &s;erve in&s;tead of hinges, by tying the piece that forms the door to the hurdle next it. Three long willow-poles are then &s;et up, with a ring on the top, made of wicker, to form the roof; through which ring, the ends of a great number of poles are put, the other end fixed in the hurdles below, and fa&s;tened with &s;trings. This being neatly executed, the whole is painted red. The &s;ke|leton now completed, is covered with felts, or a cloth made of wool, united without weaving, large enough to cover and &s;it it, and fa&s;tened on with cords wound round it. In winter, all is &s;hut clo&s;e, but in &s;ummer, the &s;ides are left open, by throwing a&s;ide the covering. In very cold weather, they lay over the whole tent, an additional covering of felts and mats, binding them on as before. The part within the ring at top, is left open for a chimney, but, as a &s;helter from the wind and rain, &s;ome cro&s;s circular pieces are fixed over it,
<FIGURE>

<PB N="213" REF="221">
on which they occa&s;ionally throw a felt, on the wind|ward &s;ide, and when the fire is burnt out within, they will cover the whole opening, to keep the hut warm.</P>
<P>In the centre of this tent &s;tands, always, a great iron trivet, under which they continually keep &s;ome fire, and over it dre&s;s their victuals in large flat iron pots. Great quantities of the&s;e pots are made at the iron manufactories in Ru&s;&s;ia, and &s;old to the Step-nations. The remainder of their furniture con&s;i&s;ts of wooden di&s;hes, drinking bowls, large and &s;mall bottles, ve&s;&s;els made of leather, a large tea pot, made of wood, but among the better cla&s;s of people, hooped with copper or &s;ilver. Their bed &s;tands oppo&s;ite the door, behind the fire-place, commonly on a &s;mall wooden bed&s;tead, the pillow and bol&s;ter of which are made of felt.</P>
<P>Dome&s;tic labour falls upon the women only, the men taking no other pains than to build and repair their tents, the re&s;t of their time being &s;pent in hunt|ing, attending their flocks, or in idlene&s;s or amu&s;e|ment. It is the woman's bu&s;ine&s;s to milk the cattle, mares, cows and ewes, and prepare the hides or &s;kins, to do the needle-work, and every other dome&s;tic occu|pation. They al&s;o knead, with their hands, camel, hor&s;e and cow-dung, make flat cakes of the compo&s;iti|on and dry them in the wind, which is the only firing they u&s;e. The women al&s;o take down the tents, pack them up and erect them afre&s;h. When the ma&s;ter of a
<PB N="214" REF="222">
hou&s;e means to go abroad, it is the duty of his wife to &s;addle his hor&s;e and bring him to the door. In &s;hort, the women have &s;o much to do, that they are &s;eldom &s;een idle. They have &s;carce time to dre&s;s them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer-time, they have abundance of milk, which, indeed, is their chief nouri&s;hment. They have commonly more hor&s;es than horned cattle, and mares milk is what they like be&s;t; for, being made &s;our, it contains &s;uch a &s;pirit, that if a per&s;on drinks two or three of their large bowls full, it will almo&s;t intoxicate him. Their cows and mares will give down no milk unle&s;s the calf or colt be pre&s;ent; on this account, colts and calves are kept almo&s;t the whole day, about their tents, &s;taked down to a particular &s;pot of ground, with long ropes, and are &s;uffered to &s;uck only at night. Their mothers will feed, naturally, not far from them, of cour&s;e, they have them always at hand. They milk the mares every hour, and each yields about the &s;eventh part of a gallon, or a moderate bottle full of milk; but, the cows are milked only twice or three times a day. Before milking, the mother is led to it's young one, and as &s;oon as it begins to &s;uck, &s;ome one pu&s;hes it away, and the milk flows freely; with the cows it is &s;ufficient to &s;hew them their calf, and &s;hould it die in the birth or afterwards, they will &s;tuff the &s;kin and tie it up among the re&s;t, in order to &s;hew it to the cow at milking-time; but the mare is not &s;o &s;imple, and they are under a nece&s;&s;ity of acting cautiou&s;ly with the&s;e,
<PB N="215" REF="223">
le&s;t it &s;hould make them &s;tubborn and refu&s;e their milk entirely.</P>
<P>Fre&s;h mares milk is much more fluid than the milk of cows, but, on account of a little alkaline ta&s;te, is not &s;o plea&s;ant; yet, if they turn it with cleanline&s;s, it has a mo&s;t delicate vinous flavour. It yields hardly any cream, of cour&s;e it is not fit for butter, though &s;ome writers fal&s;ely &s;ay it is; but it is richer in &s;pirituous and fermenting particles. In winter, when they have but little mares milk, they make &s;hift with cows milk, which is much le&s;s &s;pirituous, and, when turned four, has a more di&s;agreeable ta&s;te.</P>
<P>In order to turn the milk, they pour it gradually in|to large leathern or other ve&s;&s;els, which, in winter-time, are &s;et near the fire, either above or under ground. Commonly, unclean ve&s;&s;els alone will turn it, but if not, they forward it with leven, made of flour and &s;alt. As they di&s;till a &s;pirit from this &s;our milk, they &s;ometimes turn it with a little of this &s;pirit, if they have any or can borrow it from their neighbours, and &s;ometimes with a little of the &s;our milk which they find in the &s;tomachs of the lambs they kill. Milk de&s;igned for di&s;tilling they take no cream from, but beat it about now and then with a &s;tick, as they do in making butter; or, as the milk is collected in &s;ummer in lea|ther bottles, they &s;hake it well twice a day, and this will turn it.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="224">When they have collected a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;uch milk to make them&s;elves merry, and the whole has &s;tood to &s;our, at lea&s;t one day in &s;ummer, but more in winter, the women di&s;till a &s;pirit from it in the following manner. Having &s;et over the fire the large&s;t iron boiler they have, being fir&s;t rin&s;ed with water or melted &s;now, after &s;haking the milk, they pour it into the boiler, and fill it, within two fingers breadth of the top. This kettle contains about two or three Ru&s;&s;ian pails full, or more. It is then covered with a hollow cover that fits it, made of two pieces of wood, having two &s;quare openings; the edges of this cover and the places where the wood joins are luted with clay, glue and fre&s;h cow-dung. The Kalmucks of Stawropal u&s;e in winter, a &s;tiff dough of coar&s;e flour. Near this boiler is &s;et a &s;maller one, with a &s;imilar top, and from the opening of one to the other is fixed a curved wood|en pipe, forming a &s;till, and thus, with a &s;low fire, they will di&s;till, in an hour and a half, a bad &s;pirit, to the amount of one fourth of the milk if it be cows milk, and one third, if mares milk. But the &s;pirit di&s;tilled from mares milk, is &s;eldom &s;trong enough to burn, that from cows milk never, unle&s;s it be di&s;tilled a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>When this liquor is made, and the neighbours are a&s;|&s;embled to partake of it, the ma&s;ter of the tent throws &s;ome into the fire, &s;ome up the chimney, and after breaking a point of the clay-cover, pours a little al&s;o
<PB N="217" REF="225">
on them. So done, he fills a bowl, which contains a moderate bottle full, from the remainder, and hands it round, according to the age of the per&s;ons pre&s;ent, &s;erv|ing the olde&s;t fir&s;t, without any re&s;pect to &s;ex. The Kalmucks &s;ay, that this milk-brandy does not in|toxicate &s;o quick, or in &s;uch &s;mall quantities as Ru&s;|&s;ian brandy, but that, if a man gets drunk with it, he will continue &s;o two days, and mu&s;t &s;leep longer to recover him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The remainder of this milk, after the &s;pirit is di&s;til|led from it, is exceedingly &s;our, and they either mix it with fre&s;h cows-milk and drink it immediately, or &s;ave it, to &s;teep their &s;heep and lamb-&s;kins in; or el&s;e they boil the&s;e dregs with &s;ome fre&s;h cows milk, till it grows thick, then pour the curd into bags, and, after &s;queezing it well, dry it in the &s;un and eat it as chee&s;e. They make, al&s;o, a kind of chee&s;e from ewes milk, which they eat in winter with butter. Indeed this is the only u&s;e they make of ewes milk, deeming it unfit for di&s;tilling. To make butter from cows milk, they boil it well, turn it &s;our in the cour&s;e of one day, beat it with a butter-&s;taff and pour it into a bowl, when the oil or butter will &s;wim on the &s;urface, which they &s;kim off and keep in leather ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>They are never at a lo&s;s for meat in &s;ummer, as they can procure it in abundance, either by hunting, or from &s;uch of their cattle as die a natural or accidental
<PB N="218" REF="226">
death. Very rarely do the Kalmucks &s;laughter their own cattle, but from nece&s;&s;ity, or on &s;ome great fe&s;ti|val. This is done only by the rich and by the fir&s;t cla&s;s of people. Birds, of all kinds, they are very fond of, if fat. The badger, the marmot, and the rat, are their peculiar dainties. They account the beaver, al&s;o, to be whole&s;ome food, unle&s;s it be too fat. Be|&s;ides the&s;e animals, they eat wild hor&s;es, wild goats, wild boars, and all &s;orts of birds, even the large&s;t bird of prey: yet they abhor the fle&s;h of wolves, &s;aying, it is bitter. They eat, al&s;o, the fox and the &s;maller kinds of thieving animals with reluctance. When they have plenty of meat, in &s;ummer, they will cut it into narrow &s;lices, dry it in the &s;un or, in rainy weather, over a &s;moking fire within their tents, and lay it up for winter and travelling provi&s;ions.
<Q>Even the chiefs and fir&s;t people among them,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI> 'will feed upon cattle that have died of di&s;temper and age, and let the fle&s;h &s;tink ever &s;o much, they will eat it without di&s;gu&s;t. For this rea&s;on, in every horde, the fle&s;h-market has the appearance of a lay-&s;tall of carrion.</Q>
Bread and groats they purcha&s;e from the Ru&s;&s;ians; for, as they eat but little, they never cultivate any land or &s;ow any corn. I have been informed, however, that &s;ome of the Ordinzian Kalmucks have &s;ettled about the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h fi&s;heries and culti|vate the tobacco-plant, of which they are very fond. There are certain roots, al&s;o, which they eat, as the knots of the &s;age-tree, <HI>(phlomis tubero&s;a)</HI> which they
<PB N="219" REF="227">
call <HI>Bodmon.</HI> After drying it and reducing it to pow|der, they boil it into a pulp with milk. They eat, al&s;o, the chichling vetch, <HI>(Lathyrus tubero&s;us),</HI> which they call <HI>Schnok,</HI> and boil it with their meat; and al&s;o the roots of a &s;ort of &s;un-flower <HI>(umbellata).</HI> In&s;tead of tea, which they boil in the Mongalian fa&s;hion, with milk and butter, the common people gather on the &s;teps, a kind of &s;mall liquorice,
<Q>which they boil with &s;alt and milk; they are great lovers of mead and brandy, and both &s;exes &s;moke tobacco at an enor|mous rate.</Q></P>
<P>I made many enquiries into the manner in which the Kalmuck women tan and prepare the different &s;orts of hides and leather, and found it to be as follows. When they mean to dre&s;s their fine lamb&s;kins with care, they fir&s;t wa&s;h them clean in luke-warm water, &s;pread them in the air and let them get a little dry. They then &s;crape them, on the in&s;ide, with blunt knives, to take off the fle&s;h-&s;kin that may hang to them and render them more &s;upple: this done, they &s;pread them out in the air, on a piece of felt, and rub them over for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, thrice a day, with the dregs of the milk after it is di&s;tilled, or with &s;our cows milk, in which &s;alt has been di&s;&s;olved. On the fourth day they &s;uffer them to get quite dry, and work them between their hands on their bo&s;om, till they be|come quite &s;oft and pliant. After this, they are &s;moked, to make them re&s;i&s;t rain the better and pre|vent
<PB N="220" REF="228">
the rain from &s;poiling them. For this purpo&s;e they kindle a &s;mall fire in a little pit, and throw over it dry, rotten wood, dryed dung and other things that will create &s;moak. Sheep-dung is con&s;idered the be&s;t for this purpo&s;e. About the pit they &s;tick poles in &s;uch a manner as to form a pyramidical figure, and cover the&s;e with &s;kins, &s;o as to keep in the &s;moke, &s;ometimes changing their &s;ituation, that every part may be equal|ly &s;moked. This is continued for an hour, and, as it renders them &s;tiff again, they are a &s;econd time rubbed with the hands, till they are of a proper &s;oftne&s;s; they are next rubbed well with brui&s;ed chalk, &s;craped clean and poli&s;hed with &s;harp knives, and, at la&s;t, whitened with pieces of chalk. Nothing then remains but to clean and beat the fleece.</P>
<P>When they mean to be&s;tow le&s;s trouble, as is the ca&s;e with coar&s;e &s;kins, they lay them over with a pa&s;te made of a&s;hes and &s;alt water, to the thickne&s;s of the &s;kin it&s;elf, and as the &s;kin ab&s;orbs the lye, they do it afre&s;h; next day they &s;crape the fle&s;h-&s;ide clean and wa&s;h it with &s;our milk, and when dry, the &s;kin is worked &s;oft, and whitened with chalk. Some wa&s;h the&s;e &s;kins after they are &s;moked, and rub them with half-boiled ox and &s;heep liver, which have been laid &s;ome days in milk to rot and become a pulp. This makes them &s;oft but gives them an intolerable, bad &s;mell. All the furs they prepare for their own u&s;e, are &s;ewed by the women with fine, &s;plit &s;inews of hor&s;es, bullocks and elks, drying,
<PB N="221" REF="229">
beating and tearing them into threads, which &s;urpa&s;s all kinds of thread in &s;olidity. Hor&s;e and bullocks hides, of which they make leather ve&s;&s;els, are prepared by the Kalmucks, in the following manner. They fir&s;t &s;cald them in boiling water to get the hair off; (the backs of ox-hides make the be&s;t ve&s;&s;els), but &s;ome lay them in a&s;hes to get off the hair; which ever way it is done, they are next &s;craped and &s;moothed with knives, and wa&s;hed clean in flowing water. Others prepare them by soaking them a week or more in &s;our milk, in which a little &s;alt has been di&s;&s;olved. Boot-leather is prepared in this la&s;t way. But, in order to make the be&s;t kind, the hides are &s;pread, as they come out from the water, in the &s;un, and the women, mo&s;t &s;killed in this bu&s;ine&s;s, cut out the pieces that are to form the ve&s;&s;el, few it with &s;inew-thread and dry it in the &s;moke. They manufacture in this manner, not only ve&s;&s;els with wide mouths, giving them their form whil&s;t drying, but all kind of bottles and ve&s;&s;els with narrow necks. In order to pre&s;erve the form, they continually blow into them whil&s;t drying on the fire, or fill them with &s;and or a&s;hes. The out&s;ide they embelli&s;h with a variety of lines and figures. They even contrive to make tea-pots of leather, re&s;embling the China ones, and make them very neatly: as &s;oon as they are dry, they are fit for u&s;e; but in order to keep them firm and not liable to get &s;oft with liquid, and to take away any bad &s;mell, they &s;moke them well for &s;ome days. And as rotten and dryed cow-dung is &s;eldom to be found on the heaths, they collect it by degrees,
<PB N="222" REF="230">
and do not begin to make the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, till they have got a &s;ufficient quantity to &s;moke them with. They are &s;moked within the&s;e pyramids, till they are as tran&s;pa|rent as horn, and equally &s;olid. I have &s;een &s;ome of their bottles, which would hold as much as five or &s;ix pails.</P>
<P>Thus does the womens indu&s;try procure the men an ea&s;y and an idle life, which, as, by their con&s;titution, they are all &s;oldiers, is perhaps not reprehen&s;ible. Be|&s;ides the profe&s;&s;ion of arms and the care of their flocks, it is the department of the men to mend and repair their tents, and when they give a daughter in marriage, to build the young couple a new one. In the manufac|turing of felts, the men take al&s;o an active part. Having &s;heered their &s;heep in &s;pring and &s;ummer, with &s;harp knives, they &s;pread the wool out on an old felt carpet or mat, on which it is well beaten by ten or twelve per&s;ons, &s;itting round it, till all the du&s;t is out. It is then equally &s;pread upon a felt, the exact &s;ize of the one that is to be made, and in &s;pots where they want to vary it in colour, they place, over the fir&s;t layer of wool, dyed wool of tho&s;e colours, This done. they carefully roll up the whole together, and tye it tight with hair-cords; then all the people pre&s;ent &s;it down in two rows, oppo&s;ite to each other, take the rolled felt between them and rai&s;e it to their knees, throwing it from their knees again on the ground, with all their &s;trength, and continuing this for &s;ome hours. This
<PB N="223" REF="231">
unites the wool into a body, and when they think it is &s;ufficiently matted, they unroll it, and repair, with the hand, any defects that appear in it.</P>
<P>Kalmuck arms mo&s;tly con&s;i&s;t of lances, arrows and bows; the latter are made of different kinds of wood, but chiefly of the plane-tree. They have a variety of arrows, &s;ome &s;hort, made wholly with wood, with a knob at the end; with the&s;e they kill &s;mall animals and birds; others are light arrows, with &s;mall iron-points, and &s;ome, war-arrows with a &s;trong iron-point. All the&s;e arrows are winged with eagle-feathers, taken from the tail of the bird, as the wing-feathers are apt to car|ry the arrow out of it's direction. They are contained in certain divi&s;ions in a quiver, and hung on the right|&s;ide of the &s;addle; the bow, in a &s;cabbard on the left|&s;ide. The more opulent Kalmucks have fire-arms. Such as are well-armed wear a brea&s;t-harne&s;s, like tho&s;e of the ea&s;tern-nations, con&s;i&s;ting of net-work, made of iron and &s;teel rings; getting the&s;e from the Truchmenians. I have &s;een &s;uch brea&s;t-harne&s;s in Per&s;ia, worth more than fifty hor&s;es, con&s;i&s;ting wholly of poli&s;hed &s;teel. There are, however, cheaper ones, which they get in barter for about &s;even or eight hor&s;es. Their full-armour con&s;i&s;ts of a round helmet, with an iron net-work, that hangs down, round the neck upon the &s;houlders, but only as low as the eye-brows on the face; a coat of mail, with &s;leeves to the wri&s;t, covering the back of the hand with a &s;lip, fa&s;tened between the
<PB N="224" REF="232">
fingers; and two arm-harne&s;&s;es, extending from the elbow to the wri&s;t, and buckled on the out&s;ide of the arm, to defend it from blows in any engagement.</P>
<P>The iron-work u&s;ed for their arms, is made among them&s;elves. There are a kind of petty jewellers al&s;o among them, who make ornaments for the women, and embelli&s;h tea-pots with &s;ilver figures of animals and hoops. Their tools are very &s;imple. Their bel|lows con&s;i&s;ts of a leather-bag, with a pipe, fixed be|tween two boards, which they extend and pre&s;s to|gether.</P>
<P>Their manner of hunting is various, and they are ex|pert in taking wild bea&s;ts with any kind of trap or &s;nare; they al&s;o &s;hoot very exactly with arrows and fire-arms. Kalmucks of di&s;tinction, are very fond of hawking with a kind of hawk <HI>(falco lanarius),</HI> which frequents this di&s;trict, and is much valued. They keep al&s;o dogs, which have long ears, are good hou&s;e-dogs and expert at the chace.</P>
<P>The great wealth and &s;ub&s;tance of a Kalmuck, are his flocks and herds. But they keep more hor&s;es and &s;heep than horned cattle or camels. Their hor&s;es are not much &s;maller than tho&s;e of the Kirgue&s;e, are tolera|bly high, &s;light, but are neither hand&s;ome nor ugly; they are &s;trong enough for draught, but too wild; as to &s;wift|ne&s;s, they are inferior to none; as they have no other
<PB N="225" REF="233">
feed than what the &s;teps afford, they will live any where and almo&s;t upon any thing. Indeed, a Kalmuck never accu&s;toms them to regular feed, fearful of increa&s;ing their wildne&s;s and ferocity with their &s;trength. Some Kalmucks own a hundred hor&s;es, and other cattle in proportion. They cut their colts at the proper &s;ea&s;on, by opening their <HI>&s;crotum,</HI> catching hold of the &s;perma|tic ve&s;&s;els and nipping off the te&s;ticles with their nails, &s;earing the part with a red-hot iron. They do the &s;ame with &s;heep and calves. That they may never want mares milk, they &s;uffer the &s;tallions to run continually with the mares.</P>
<P>Kalmuck &s;heep, like tho&s;e of the Kirgue&s;e, have very thick and fat tails, though not quite &s;o large as Kirgui|&s;ian &s;heep. Their rams have hanging ears, &s;eldom any horns, and their wool is le&s;s hairy, generally white with &s;potted faces. The &s;heep here are &s;uffered to feed in all &s;ea&s;ons, and, as they lick the &s;now, require no water. Among the Kalmuck flocks are generally a few goats, with pendant ears, &s;potted with &s;everal co|lours, having long hairs hanging down their legs, but &s;eldom any horns.</P>
<P>As camels multiply but &s;lowly, their property in the&s;e is but &s;mall, but they have as many as they want and often &s;ome to &s;ell. They have &s;ome with one bunch on their backs and others two. Many are taken to Orenburg market, and there trucked away to the Bu|charians.
<PB N="226" REF="234">
This animal thrives well on the &s;teps, a|mong the &s;alt-plants, but requires attention in winter, it being nece&s;&s;ary then to cover their loins with mats or old felts.</P>
<P>Kalmucks pa&s;s the winter with their flocks in the mo&s;t &s;outhern di&s;trict of the Wolga &s;tep and along the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, but always at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Jaik, where the Kirgue&s;e, their mo&s;t cruel enemies, have fixed their abode. They find there plenty of reeds to kindle fire with, and as it &s;nows but little, the cattle have no difficulty in finding food. With the beginning of &s;pring, they draw, by degrees, to the north and &s;eek the hilly and watry di&s;tricts of the milder &s;tep, till af|ter the Wolga has entered within it's bounds, and of|fers a richer pa&s;ture in the lower lands.</P>
<P>The Kalmucks thus emigrating, in order to &s;eek a better pa&s;ture, find an uncommon advantage in their camels. The&s;e animals not only carry their tents and all belonging to them, but al&s;o their hou&s;hold furni|ture, trunks, bags of cloaths and other little matters. They will not employ the one-bunched camel, particu|larly white ones, which they call <HI>Bucharians,</HI> but to tran&s;port their &s;acred books, their idols, or burchans, and other holy articles. The&s;e &s;acred things are pack|ed up, loaded on &s;mall waggons and drawn by white camels, decorated with large and &s;mall bells; and no|thing is plea&s;anter than to meet &s;uch a &s;uite of Kal|mucks.

<Q>The fine herds march foremo&s;t, feeding as they go; next follows a large company of armed herd&s;men, next the camels and oxen, with the hor&s;es and furniture, then the women and children on hor&s;e-back, in their gaye&s;t apparel,</Q>
driving the cattle, and &s;inging merrily as they pa&s;s, whil&s;t a number of the men rove about the environs of the road, hunting. Indeed, the chief part of this peoples life, which to us appears wretched, is interwoven with gaiety, and the more unfortunate we deem them, the happier they find them&s;elves. However unwhole&s;ome their nouri&s;h|ment and habitations may appear, yet many arrive at an advanced, old age, gay and free from infirmities.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay much of their di&s;ea&s;es, which are not many in number, like tho&s;e of civilized nations, on ac|count of their plain way of living: but as their chief aliment is meat, and that eaten half rotten, it is ea&s;ily to be conceived that they mu&s;t have &s;ome inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es. The mo&s;t dreadful and dangerous di&s;order among them, is a burning and infective fever, mortal on the eighth day. Where it &s;eizes families, it will carry off one or more from each tent. Tho&s;e who live in the neighbourhood of &s;uch as are afflicted with this di&s;temper, fly from their abode and &s;earch, at a farther di&s;tance, for a &s;afer one. The itch is al&s;o a frequent complaint among the lower &s;ort of Kalmucks, which ari&s;es from their manner of feeding and their indolent &s;tate of life, during the winter. But they are more af|flicted
<PB N="228" REF="237">
with the <HI>furor amoro&s;us,</HI> ari&s;ing from the &s;cald. The biles, indeed, make their appearance but &s;eldom, but when they do, they rage with virulence. This is al&s;o ob&s;erved among the Kalmucks of Stawropal, who are more &s;ubject to it; &s;o that it is clearly, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the quantity of animal food they eat. Owing to their &s;moky tents, the intolerable heat of the &s;un, and the yellowne&s;s of the heaths; inflammations of the eyes are &s;o frequent that many wear a &s;lip of crape over them, by way of prevention.
<Q>The &s;choolma&s;ter is generally the &s;urgeon; he feels the pul&s;e, opens a vein, &s;carifies and cly&s;ters.</Q></P>
<P>It is time now to &s;ay &s;omething of their political and religious con&s;titution. The Kalmucks were once &s;ubject to certain chiefs, who&s;e prerogatives were hereditary. Even, at pre&s;ent, the nation is divided among little, tributary princes, who call them&s;elves <HI>Nojonn,</HI> and pay but little obediance to the Khan, that overules the whole. The horde &s;ubject to &s;uch a Nojonn, is called <HI>Ulu&s;s,</HI> and is &s;ubdivided into &s;mall fraternities, living not far from each other, under the name of <HI>Aimaks,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of from 150 to 300 families, who are &s;urbordinate to certain nobles, bearing the title of <HI>Sai&s;&s;ang.</HI> Each Aimak is again divided, on account of the pa&s;ture, into companies of ten or twelve tents, compo&s;ing what they call a <HI>Chatun,</HI> which, properly &s;peaking, im|plies a boiler, &s;o that Chatun is a is a &s;ociety which cooks out of the &s;ame boiler. Each Chatun has an
<PB N="229" REF="238">
over&s;eer, who owes obediance to the Sai&s;&s;ang of their Aimak, as does the Sai&s;&s;ang to the Nojonn. A Nojonn receives tithes of cattle from all his &s;ubjects. He has a right <HI>ad libitum</HI> to inflict corporal puni&s;hment for all mi&s;demeanours, and can &s;entence them to have their ears, no&s;e and hand cut off, but not to take away any man's life publickly; though he exerci&s;es this pow|er privately, on tho&s;e who incur his di&s;plea&s;ure. If a Nojonn has not regulated the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in his life-time, or made prie&s;ts of &s;ome of his children, they will, after his death, divide the ulu&s;&s;es among them&s;elves, and this divi&s;ion is commonly very unequal. The mode of &s;aluting a Nojonn, among the common Kal|mucks, is by clo&s;ing the hand, holding it to the fore|head, and then touching the Nojonn's hip therewith, and, if the Nojonn thinks proper to return the compli|ment, it is by &s;triking the other on his &s;houlder.</P>
<P>'The princes,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>
<Q>are only dependent on the Khan, in matters of general importance; in every other re&s;pect, they are independent. They ac|quire their ulu&s;&s;es by hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The Khan has a privy-council, or <HI>&s;arga,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of Nojonns, Sai&s;&s;angs and Prie&s;ts, wherein &s;its an a&s;&s;e&s;|&s;or from every ulu&s;s, and an advocate from the government's chancery at A&s;trachan; and, here it is, that laws are enacted.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="239">There are &s;everal other dignities, or titles, conferred by the Nojonns or Khan, as the &s;overeign lord of the ulu&s;s, but I am not acquainted with them.

<P><Q>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the hordes is altogether mili|tary. Every &s;ubject mu&s;t, on the fir&s;t orders, repair on hor&s;eback to the head-quarters of his prince, armed and with a good &s;tock of provi&s;ions. The troops are a&s;&s;embled almo&s;t as &s;oon as the order is known. The prince mu&s;ters them, and &s;ends the feeble and the wretched home again. This mu&s;ter la&s;ts &s;ome time, and procures the &s;erviceable men the di&s;tinction of Men of war. The head-quarters of the prince are known by the whitene&s;s of the tents, and by being &s;urrounded by other tents in a circle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The army is compo&s;ed of regiments of unequal numbers, and every regiment <HI>(Ottok)</HI> is divided into hundreds. Each regiment has it's colours painted with the idol-gods of war, dragons, &s;erpents, tigers, lions, &amp;c. it's colonels <HI>(Tzrigen ya&s;&s;ool),</HI> captains <HI>(Soon ya&s;&s;ool),</HI> and other officers, but no martial mu&s;ic. Every regiment is compo&s;ed of three com|panies,
<PB N="231" REF="240">
mu&s;quetry, bowmen and neck-breakers, or lance-breakers. The mu&s;quetry fir&s;t attack, next the bowmen, and, la&s;t of all, the neck-breakers. They fight with courage, and u&s;ually conquer all that fight in their way: but, again&s;t the regular troops, I mean the troops of government, they can make no &s;tand, except when they are va&s;tly &s;uperior in numbers. When they &s;erve the Ru&s;&s;ian crown, they are equipped and paid as Co&s;&s;acks.</Q></P>
<P>It is very remarkable that the Kalmuck princes have long &s;ince thought of and enacted laws, which would put tho&s;e European civili&s;ed nations to the blu&s;h, who, with an affected di&s;dain, pre&s;ume to call them barba|rians. They have a code of laws written in Monga|lian language, which, in the reign of <HI>Galdan-Khan,</HI> was improved and ratified by twenty-four Mongalian and Uiratian princes, in the pre&s;ence of three <HI>Kutuchts,</HI> or high-prie&s;ts; wherein they trifle not with the life of a man, nor inflict on him ordinary and extraordinary tortures, in order to force from the weak and innocent a confe&s;&s;ion of crimes he never thought of: the penal|ties in their code of laws, are forfeitures of property, proportioned to every degree of crime. I will mention &s;ome. For trea&s;on and ho&s;tilities among princes and ulu&s;&s;es them&s;elves, the penalty is forfeitures of their whole property, or &s;uch a mortification as the wealth and rank of the&s;e princes will admit of. For di|&s;ertion in general war, for cowardice or ill-conduct in
<PB N="232" REF="241">
battle, the forfeiture of a commanding-officer is as heavy as his circum&s;tances will admit of; their arms are taken from them, they are degraded and led about in womens clothes. For murder, the puni&s;hment is very great, but does not affect the life, nor wound the body of the criminal, even though he were a parricide. If men quarrel and fight, and one is killed, every one who was a &s;tander-by and did not &s;trive to prevent it, is fined a hor&s;e. Where a man is kiled in publick games, the party killing is to receive and maintain the wife and children of the decea&s;ed. For a&s;&s;aults and wounds the fines are proportioned to the injury done; it is enacted how much &s;hall be paid to atone for a tooth, ear, and each finger of the hand. Parents or pa|rents-in-law, who beat their children, without a cau&s;e, are al&s;o liable to fines. There are al&s;o fines for in&s;ults or affronts, the principal of which to men, is pulling the hair or beard, tearing off the fringe from the cap, &s;pitting or throwing &s;and in the face; and, to women, pulling their tre&s;&s;es, or touching them wantonly on the bo&s;om or el&s;ewhere. In this latter ca&s;e, the puni&s;h|ment is adapted to the age of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or. For adultery and whoredom, which is often committed with &s;laves, and for be&s;tiality, the fines are but &s;mall. It would be too exten&s;ive to give a detail of the fines an|nexed, for interruption of hunting, extingui&s;hing of lamps, detaining lo&s;t cattle, or keeping a lo&s;t carca&s;e without giving notice of it, and other little ca&s;es. The &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment is inflicted for theft. Be&s;ides the
<PB N="233" REF="242">
re&s;titution of the &s;tolen goods, and a fine of cattle, it is enacted, that the robber, even of a trifle, &s;hall lo&s;e one finger, unle&s;s he thinks proper to buy off this cor|poral puni&s;hment, by paying five head of cattle. There are even fines annexed to &s;tealing needles or yarn. And, in an appendix to this code, <HI>Galdan-Khan,</HI> him|&s;elf, added, that an over&s;eer of one hundred tents, or an amiak, &s;hould be re&s;pon&s;ible for the thefts commit|ted by his &s;ubjects: and that the over&s;eers of a cha|tun, knowing of a theft and not giving notice of it, &s;hall lo&s;e a hand; but the common people are to be laid in irons, and he that has been three times convic|ted of theft, &s;hall lo&s;e all the property he has. The fines are chiefly great and &s;mall cattle, in proportion to the circum&s;tances of the delinquent and the heinou&s;|ne&s;s of the crime or offence, and are divided be|tween the nojonn, the clergy and the plaintiff. The fines of per&s;ons of rank are a certain number of arrows, helmets and other warlike acoutrements. The highe&s;t fine inflicted on a prince for ho&s;tility, is 100 coats of mail, 100 camels and 1000 hor&s;es; and, to inforce the payment, the other princes are to ri&s;e in one body again&s;t him; and &s;hould he have ruined whole ulu&s;&s;es, or large aimaks, they deprive him of his all, keeping one half to them&s;elves and dividing the other among the injured party. For &s;ome crimes, the perpetrator is to lo&s;e one or more of his children. The &s;malle&s;t fine is a male or female goat, or a &s;mall number of arrows.</P>

<P>But I mu&s;t proceed to their religion, and &s;peak of tho&s;e &s;piritual and temporal cu&s;toms as have any con|nexion with it. Their doctrine is the religion of <HI>Lama,</HI> mo&s;tly the &s;ame with that of their brethren, the Mon|gols, whom they copy in language, writing and manner of living. In this religion, we find, as in that of Brahma, a complete &s;y&s;tem of the &s;tructure of the world; it's pa&s;t and future &s;tate envelloped in a laby|rinth of fables and crafty illu&s;ions: it includes the old doctrine of Metemp&s;ycho&s;is or the tran&s;migration of &s;ouls, in &s;o &s;trict a &s;en&s;e, as that all their deities, who formerly were men, had, before their deification, been rigorou&s;ly &s;ubject to their law, having wandered through many animal bodies.

<PB N="237" REF="246">
Common &s;ouls proceed directly to the judg|ment-&s;eat in Paradi&s;e, without any wandering, and re|ceive the decree that di&s;po&s;es of them for ever. This is their faith, at lea&s;t as to their principal idols. The Kalmuck religion, in the externals or ceremonials, has &s;o near an affinity to many practi&s;ed by &s;ome &s;ects of chri&s;tians, I mean in their opinions of the change of the world, and &s;everal other points, that it is proba|ble, to tho&s;e who give a &s;cope to conjecture, that the religions of Brahma and Lama, are much connected with that of the Ne&s;torians. Some few ceremonies in their divine &s;ervice, which I will de&s;cribe, will ju&s;tify this &s;uppo&s;ition; but, before I proceed, I will give my readers &s;ome account of the Lama doctrine, which is contained and di&s;per&s;ed in innumerable writings, part of which I have collected from &s;everal tran&s;lations of little Mongalian, theological authors, which I was fa|voured with from the Proto-pope, or high-prie&s;t of the chri&s;tian Kalmucks, at Stawropal, <HI>Andrew T&s;chubof&s;koi,</HI> who is perfectly acquainted with their language. I &s;hall add, al&s;o, what I could gather from conver&s;ation, re&s;pecting this exten&s;ive, fabulous doctrine, that a bet|ter knowledge may be formed of it, and that it may be &s;een how far the Brahma faith corre&s;ponds with it. I have been informed, that the Indians, of which there are no &s;mall number in A&s;trachan, not only acknow|ledge the Kalmucks to be their brethren, but pay, al&s;o, divine honour to the Kalmuck idols, called Burchan Aju&s;cha and D&s;chakd&s;chimmum, which have a great
<PB N="238" REF="247">
re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the Tangutians. If this be true, it is an inconte&s;table proof, that the religion of Lama originated in India, and that the Kalmucks are de&s;cendants of the Mongols.</P>
<P>In the beginning, we have the whim&s;ical &s;tory of the Lamas, about the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e. They &s;ay, that at fir&s;t, without any creator, there was an immen&s;e &s;pace, or chaos, who&s;e width and depth a|mounted to 6,160,000 leagues, or beres, (each league or bere being equal to about &s;ix Engli&s;h miles); but, they fix no time of it's commencement. In this &s;pace gathered &s;ome gold-coloured clouds, which &s;hed a rain &s;o abundantly as to form the unmea&s;urable ocean. That an immen&s;e thick froth grew upon the &s;ea like milk, (the dimen&s;ions of which, is al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed in their books), and that from this froth i&s;&s;ued all living creatures; and that from men their idols were pro|duced. That a &s;torm next aro&s;e, from certain parts of the heavens, which gave exi&s;tence to a column extend|ing from the upper-region, to far below the deepe&s;t bottom of the elementary ocean. They call this co|lumn <HI>Sjumer Sula,</HI> and &s;ay, it's circumference amounts to &s;ome thou&s;ands of leagues, or beres. About this column, as an axis, move the habitable worlds. But how the &s;un, moon and &s;tars came to exi&s;t in the up|per-regions, their treati&s;es give no account. They &s;ay the &s;un con&s;i&s;ts of gla&s;s and fire, and is &s;ome hund|red leagues in circumference. And, as they hold gla&s;s
<PB N="239" REF="248">
to be one part of the body of the &s;un, and have burn|ing-gla&s;&s;es among them, it is plain that &s;uch gla&s;&s;es mu&s;t have been known a great while in the ea&s;t. They deem the moon to be &s;omewhat &s;maller than the &s;un, and make it con&s;i&s;t of gla&s;s and water. The number of &s;tars they fix at ten thou&s;and millions, which will lead our a&s;tronomers to judge of their other calculati|ons. The &s;un, in the Kalmuck &s;y&s;tem, has an orbicu|lar cour&s;e round the middle part of the great column, or Sjumer Sula. This column &s;hews four &s;ides, each of a different colour, one &s;ilver, one &s;ky-blue, one golden and one of a deep-red. When the &s;un ca&s;ts it's beams on the &s;ilver-&s;ide,, the dawn begins, and if, by degrees, the bright-blue is illuminated, noon makes it's entrance, but it is not perfect noon till it &s;hines up|on the golden &s;ide; and when it throws it's light on the deep-red &s;ide, the twilight commences, and continues till the &s;un hides it&s;elf from our view behind the co|lumn, and this is night.</P>
<P>About the column, they &s;ay, roll, in general, four great worlds, and between the&s;e the &s;maller ones, joined in couples, of which they reckon eight, and all the &s;tars and worlds are made fa&s;t to it with a great iron-ring. Among the greater worlds &s;tands ours on the right, which they call <HI>Sambu-tup,</HI> as a great num|ber of trees grow on it, unknown to them, but called by them, <HI>J&s;ambu-barachia.</HI> Oppo&s;ite to this, is a world inhabited by giants, <HI>(Ulyum &s;chibiytu-tup).</HI> The

third world they call <HI>Ukir-edlekt&s;chi,</HI> on which there are only cows; but, in the fourth world, <HI>Mun-do-uto-tup,</HI> exi&s;t a people without &s;ouls. They live 7000 years without &s;ickne&s;s, and when the time of their di&s;&s;o|lution draws near, on the &s;eventh day preceding their end, they hear a voice calling them by their names, and announcing their dead-warrant. They then call their relations and friends together, and take a la&s;ting farewell.</P>
<P>They de&s;cribe all the&s;e worlds as very exten&s;ive, to which no other creature, except their idols, can pa&s;s, and the&s;e can go from one world to another. Be&s;ides the&s;e worlds, they reckon &s;even other abodes, eight little oceans, and many clouds, on which re&s;ide their aerial &s;pirits in the va&s;t <HI>vacuum,</HI> and &s;ay that the whole &s;y&s;tem is encompa&s;&s;ed and fa&s;tened, as it were, together, by an enormous iron-ring; giving and relating circum|&s;tantial &s;tories of all the&s;e brainle&s;s chimeras.</P>
<P>In our world, they &s;ay, &s;pring four principal rivers, from four mountains, to which they give the following remarkable names, <HI>Ganga, Schilda, Bakt&s;chu</HI> and <HI>Aipera.</HI> Between the&s;e four mountains feeds, for four months in a year, an elephant, of which they relate many wonders, and call him <HI>Ga&s;ar-Sakikjin Kowen,</HI> or the protector of the earth. This elephant is &s;ome miles long and high, and white as &s;now, has thirty-three red heads; on each head, &s;ix trunks; on each
<PB N="241" REF="250">
trunk &s;ix fountains, and upon the fountains &s;ix &s;tars; each &s;tar be&s;et with a virgin-offspring of their aerial &s;pirits. On the central head of the elephant rides the great genius of the earth, called <HI>Churmu&s;tu Tenga,</HI> when he goes from one place to another.</P>
<P>Immediately after the creation of the world, men reached a very di&s;tant age, lived nearly 80,000 years, were fed by invi&s;ible gifts of grace, <HI>(Kidi-Dianar)</HI> and had the wonderful power of rai&s;ing them&s;elves to heaven. All this time tran&s;migration was general, and all men were <HI>Chubulgans,</HI> or regenerated. This rege|neration in human bodies, according to the doctrine of the Lamas, is a thorough change from common mor|tality, (a rare prerogative allowed only to the clergy, &s;ome per&s;ons of a holy di&s;po&s;ition, and to the nojonns or princes). It was al&s;o in that age, or epoch, when the thou&s;and Burchans, or idols, whom the Kalmucks wor&s;hip, went to heaven.</P>
<P>This was followed, &s;ay they, by an unlucky epoch. The earth produced a certain &s;weet-ta&s;ting herb, like honey, which is called, in their books, <HI>Schime,</HI> and there was a voracious man who eat thereof, and made it known to all the re&s;t. Hereby, all the holine&s;s of mankind, and their power of flying to heaven, cea&s;ed, their longevity and gigantic &s;tature decrea&s;ed, and they lived a great while in darkne&s;s, till the &s;un and &s;tars took their origin.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="251">After men had fed a certain time upon this plant, it failed, and they were forced to &s;upport life with a ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of earth-butter, that looked ruddy and had a very &s;weet ta&s;te; but this failing al&s;o, they had recour&s;e to a &s;ort of &s;edge <HI>(&s;ala-&s;emis),</HI> and began to &s;tore it up and make provi&s;ion of it; but in&s;tead of it's encrea&s;|ing, it fell entirely away.

They began at this time to cultivate the land, and cho&s;e the wi&s;e&s;t among them as their chief. This chief divided the land and other goods among his people, and is, at la&s;t, become the Khan.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate, according to their opinion, lives the pre&s;ent age. During the pa&s;t golden-age, &s;everal of the thou&s;and Burchans or idols of that happy period, appeared on earth, in order to reform mankind. For example, at that time, when the life of man had de|crea&s;ed to 40,000 years, appeared in the empire of Enednai, (which, perhaps is that of the Mogul), <HI>Ebdef|chi-Burchan,</HI> (the de&s;troyer), and preached religion. At the decline of human life to 30,000, he was followed by <HI>Altan-D&s;chidakti-Burchan,</HI> (the golden unalloyed). When life fell to 20,000 years, came <HI>Gerel-Sakikt&s;chi-Burchan,</HI> (the pre&s;erver of the world), <NOTE N="(*)" PLACE="foot">One might &s;uppo&s;e, that under this and the preced|ing name, lies &s;ome ob&s;cure and deformed tradition of the Saviour.</NOTE> and after

him, <HI>Mafsu&s;chiri-Burchan,</HI> upon this world; and, fi|nally, when the limits of man's age dropped to one hundred years, the great Burchan, and founder of the doctrine of Lama, <HI>D&s;chak&s;himuni</HI> came down and preached to the &s;ixty-one nations of the earth. But it is to be lamented, &s;ay they, that each li&s;tened to the doctrine with different ears, it having produced as many religions and languages as there are nations.</P>

After this, &s;ickne&s;s and death will come among them, and carry off the greate&s;t part. Before all people die, the aerial &s;pirits will make them&s;elves heard, and it will rain mortal &s;hots. A few of the remaining dwarfs, frightened out of their &s;en&s;es, will take provi&s;ion for &s;even days, hide them&s;elves in dark holes, and the land will be over-&s;pread with carca&s;es and blood. After this, will follow rain, which &s;hall wa&s;h away all the dead bodies and every impurity into the de&s;art ocean; and a fragrant &s;hower will clean&s;e the earth; then &s;hall the heavens rain down cloaths and food for tho&s;e who&s;e lives were &s;pared, and they &s;hall begin to live virtu|ou&s;ly, and a va&s;t &s;pace of time &s;hall pa&s;s, during which, the limits of human life &s;hall extend to 80,000 years.

They are &s;o numerous, and they relate &s;o much of each, as to fill whole folios; but their tales are &s;o con|fu&s;ed and the Kalmuck Clergy &s;o ignorant, that it is dif|ficult to make out the context, without tran&s;lating and comparing many of their writings. So far it is certain, that the&s;e Burchans have originated from holy men, or men pretending to holine&s;s, who have a&s;&s;erted that they pa&s;&s;ed through many bodies before they were re|generated, or from fabulous per&s;ons or deformed idols of &s;ome other more ancient religion. I could not ab|&s;olutely find out whether, be&s;ides the&s;e Burchans, they admit of &s;ome higher &s;upreme being, or, whether they account for the fir&s;t operative principles in the manner of <HI>Epicurus;</HI> but, from what has been related, I &s;hould rather &s;uppo&s;e the latter to be the ca&s;e. Good and bad events are governed by Burchans, and good or malignant aerial &s;pirits. There &s;eems to be degrees of rank among their Burchans, at lea&s;t they differ much from one another in power and occupation.

with a certain &s;weetne&s;s and beauty of countenance, but the malignant ones, in&s;pire fright and horror. I was lucky enough to meet with a great collection of the&s;e idols in Jaizkoi-Gorodok, which were ca&s;t hol|low in bra&s;s, &s;trongly gilt and &s;o neatly executed as to equal, if not &s;urpa&s;s, the engraved figures. The foot of each Burchan is made hollow, clo&s;ed with a plate of copper and contains a little cylinder, made of a&s;hes, wrapped up in a piece of paper, or the upper ba&s;t of the birch-tree, with a Tangutian in&s;cription, or, at lea&s;t, a ticket with &s;uch an in&s;cription. The&s;e cylin|ders of a&s;hes are, undoubtedly, con&s;idered as relicks of the holy bodies which the Burchans once inhabited. I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention, pre&s;ently, that the a&s;hes of &s;uch per&s;ons, as are &s;uppo&s;ed to be regenerated, are &s;ent to the chief pontiff, or high-prie&s;t of this reli|gion, at Thibet. It is al&s;o certain, that if once the cover of the foot of &s;uch an image is opened, the Kal|mucks con&s;ider it as profaned, and it is no longer &s;ale|able. They purcha&s;e with avidity, and at high rates, from the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants, tho&s;e Burchans which, at the de&s;troying of the Sjungorian, or D&s;ungorian, pow|er, became the plunder of the Kirgue&s;e, trucking with the Ru&s;&s;ians for other things; provided the foot of &s;uch idols has not been opened and the inner part has remained untouched.</P>

They report of <HI>Burchan D&s;chakd&s;himmuni,</HI> that whil&s;t his &s;oul inhabited the body of a hare, &s;eeing a man almo&s;t &s;tarved with hunger, he ran voluntarily into his hands, and, that the genius of the earth admired this noble act &s;o much, that he placed the form of a hare in the moon, as a monument to after-ages; and the Kalmucks believe now they &s;ee a hare in the moon.</P>
<P>The other &s;tory is curious, and to the be&s;t of my re|collection, there is a &s;imilar tale in the life of an Indian idol, told in the letters of a je&s;uit-mi&s;&s;ionary. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve fir&s;t, that the Kalmucks imagine that there are always certain, evil &s;pirits and agents of their gods of hell; hovering in the air. I mean the lower cla&s;s of Kalmucks and their clergy; for there are, as in other countrys, Kalmuck-freethinkers, who laugh at &s;uch ab&s;urd &s;tories. They believe, that a miraculous dragon, called <HI>Luu-Chan</HI> lives, during winter, in the water, and ri&s;es into the air in &s;pring, when &s;ome of the infernal agents ride upon him. When it lightens, they &s;uppo&s;e this dragon opens it's jaws, and when it thun|ders, that the deputy of hell is whipping him, till he roars again for pain. Once it happened, that as the three burchans <HI>Mafsu&s;chini, D&s;chakd&s;himmuni,</HI> and <HI>Mai|darin,</HI> were &s;itting together praying and in profound devotion with their eyes &s;hut, according to the Kal|muck cu&s;tom, a malignant &s;pirit drew near, and let
<PB N="251" REF="260">
fall his excrements into the &s;acred bowl, which per&s;ons of &s;acerdotal dignity commonly have before them, when praying. As &s;oon as the&s;e holy men &s;aw this, they deliberated together how they &s;hould act. If they threw this venemous matter into the air, all beings there, they thought, would peri&s;h; but if they poured the infected bowl over the earth, every living creature would in&s;tantly be killed, they agreed therefore to &s;wal|low the contents them&s;elves: <HI>Mafsu&s;chini</HI> and <HI>Maidarin</HI> drank fir&s;t, and as <HI>D&s;chakd&s;himmuni</HI> was to fini&s;h the bowl, the &s;ediment was &s;o thick as almo&s;t to &s;trangle him, &s;o that he looked blue in the face. For this rea|&s;on, he is &s;till repre&s;ented in pictures with a blue face, but in ca&s;t figures, with a blue, lacquered cap.</P>
<P>I have, more than once, mentioned tho&s;e aerial &s;pirits which make the greate&s;t figure in the fabulous doctrine of Lama, and ob&s;erved that they were generally called <HI>Tengri.</HI> We may compare them to guardian &s;aints and Roman-catholic angels. Some are propitious, others malignant &s;pirits, and both are very much in|ferior to the burchans, neither are they &s;uppo&s;ed to be immortal. They are divided into various cla&s;&s;es, &s;ome of which I am unacquainted with, and have &s;tated abodes near and in the worlds, and in the great <HI>vacuum.</HI> They know the &s;ize of every one and how long each will live. Near our earth are four, &s;uch evil &s;pirits called <HI>Machara&s;a,</HI> who are only 125 fathoms high. Above the&s;e, dwell the thirty-three &s;pirits already mentioned, who are 150 fathoms in height, and one, among them,
<PB N="252" REF="261">
called <HI>Tejus-Bijas-Chubilgak&s;am,</HI> is &s;aid to be taller &s;till. Another &s;ort called <HI>Chublgak&s;am-Edlek&s;chi,</HI> are near three miles in height and live 10,206,000 years; there are &s;ome others 6,771,000 miles high, who&s;e tedious, barba|rian names I &s;hall omit. A day to the&s;e &s;pirits, is as fifty-years to men, and they live 500 years compo&s;ed of &s;uch days. As wonderful as are the properties given them, &s;o wonderful is their propagation; &s;ome generate only by ki&s;&s;es, embracing them&s;elves, others by &s;miling at each other, by a wink and a glance, and &s;ome only by friendly looks. As far as I could learn, in conver&s;ation with &s;ome Kalmuck prie&s;ts, they believe that all bad weather and unlucky events, among which are numbered the above-mentioned, bad epochs of the world, ari&s;e from malignant &s;pirits, who neverthele&s;s, mu&s;t yield and &s;ubmit to the power of Tangutian prayers and exorci&s;ms. But the propitious &s;pirits, who&s;e faces are bright, and white as &s;now, and burchans are intere&s;ted in the good of the world and mankind.</P>
<P>An e&s;&s;ential, indeed the chief article, in the religion of Lama, and which mu&s;t have the greate&s;t influence upon morality, is their doctrine of the &s;tate of the &s;oul after death, re&s;pecting hell and rewards. I collected many accounts on this &s;ubject, and &s;hall communicate the mo&s;t probable.</P>
<P>Hell is &s;ituated in the middle region between hea|ven and earth. Here the matter is very indefinite,
<PB N="253" REF="262">
but the following is more circum&s;tantial. In a large city, encompa&s;&s;ed with white walls, wherein there is a continual beating of kettle-drums, the mighty bur|chan, <HI>Erlik Khan,</HI> unlimited governor of hell and judge of departed &s;ouls, holds his re&s;idence in a &s;pacious palace.</P>

<P>On one &s;ide of the city, is a large ocean of urine and excrement, which con&s;titutes the fir&s;t abode of the damned. Over this &s;ea pa&s;&s;es the above mentioned

Farther on is a &s;ea of blood, in which many human heads are &s;wimming. The&s;e are they, who, during their life, had &s;owed di&s;cord and occa&s;i|oned blood-&s;hed among friends and relations. Farther on &s;till, is a remote, white land, where many of the damned endeavour to dig for water and food, with|out being able to find it, and who&s;e hands and arms are &s;o much wounded in digging, that they drop from their &s;houlders with exqui&s;ite pain, but grow again, to renew their torments. The&s;e are people who gave, whil&s;t they lived, neither meat, drink nor cloathing to the prie&s;ts.

Their devils are repre&s;ented with all &s;orts of frightful forms, black, with the heads
<PB N="255" REF="264">
of goats,, lions and unicorns. In one divi&s;ion of this place, many run about without feet, for having de|&s;pi&s;ed the doctrines of the prie&s;t-hood. In another are &s;itting tho&s;e rich per&s;ons who, though living in abun|dance, never admini&s;tered to the wants of the poor. The&s;e are in an un-heard-of condition; are transform|ed into mon&s;ters who&s;e heads and bodies are each as big as a mountain, and their neck as &s;mall as a thread. In other places, dreadful pits of unremitted yells, the cruel are tormented, tho&s;e who have either killed their parent, elders or other men, cattle or even in&s;ects; for, according to the tenets of Lamai&s;m, it is &s;inful to kill, purpo&s;ely, even the &s;malle&s;t vermin that infect and plague mankind, and they are of opinion, that the &s;ouls of all animals, &s;o de&s;troyed, will, when in tran&s;migration they inherit other bo|dies, &s;eek revenge. In other divi&s;ions, are multitudes of mockers of religion, who&s;e ears &s;ome little devils are alway filling with burning &s;oot, that, eager as they may be, they may not hear each other. Wretches, who have robbed the the &s;acred &s;hrines of burchans, burnt &s;piritual books, or have proudly lived, are, in a particular place, thrown into boiling caldrons filled with &s;erpents. In other places, the damned are con|tinually roa&s;ting upon gridirons, or &s;pitted with a lance. There is, al&s;o, a place where there are one hundred and eight hooks fa&s;tened in a cloud of or|dure, on which &s;inners are hung, and when the wind blows them down, they fall on &s;harp points, which
<PB N="256" REF="265">
lie underneath, and tear their bodies to pieces. Yet &s;till a voice is heard, that calls them back to life, and their puni&s;hment continues &s;ome hundred millions of years, con&s;tantly torn to pieces, and their limbs beat and pounded in mortars. There are, al&s;o, dark, yet red-hot, infernal dungeons, and here and there a cold hell, where &s;inful men are frozen to death, before the ri&s;ing or the &s;un, and are dragged about by furies till they are thawed to life again, in order to renew their torments. Farther on, is a place, where tho&s;e who &s;pent their life in dre&s;s and lived luxuriou&s;|ly are puni&s;hed. A pack of little devils are here employed in forging curry-combs; and, when redhot, tearing therewith the backs of &s;inners. La&s;tly, there is another place, where delinquents are &s;queezed between iron blocks, in form of mill-&s;tones, and always brought back to life, to be &s;queezed to death again. There is a place where cattle, inhabited by human &s;ouls, have &s;inned, and al&s;o &s;uffer the puni&s;hment of eating and drinking, without ever being &s;atisfied. It is not to be wondered at, that they &s;hould fix an abode in hell for cattle, for, according to the Lama faith, they have the high prerogative of entering into the paradi&s;e of burchans and aerial &s;pirits. But this well-policed hell, has no place of puni&s;hment for lu&s;t, which is very little thought of, wherever this religion prevails.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="266">Great and holy Lamas, who have been zealous in their office and obtained a victory over all their pa&s;|&s;ions, pa&s;s, when they die, by the aid of their prayers only, (of which the words <HI>om ma wie pad, me chum</HI> have the greate&s;t influence), immediately into heaven, to the abode of the burchans, where they enjoy perfect re&s;t with other godly &s;ouls, and exerci&s;e them&s;elves in divine &s;ervice, till the time of their regeneration comes.</P>
<P>Common &s;ouls, are received by the infernal agent, who brings them before <HI>Erlik-Khan,</HI> where they they mu&s;t account for their pa&s;t actions and ju&s;tify them&s;elves: if they can do this, &s;o as to leave no doubt of their righteou&s;ne&s;s, they are &s;ent with honour to the ble&s;t abodes, he ordering a flying cloud, with a golden throne, to tran&s;port &s;uch a &s;oul. Tho&s;e who, living on earth, did much good and much evil, have a good burchan for their advocate, to plead their cau&s;e with the in|fernal deputy, <HI>Erlik-Khan,</HI> who orders the large book to be brought, where all the actions of men are regi&s;|tered, and examines it; and &s;hould the cau&s;e be doubtful, he takes a ballance, writes the good again&s;t the evil, and pronounces &s;entence accordingly; and the &s;oul, &s;o &s;entenced, is delivered to the bur|chans, or good, aerial &s;pirits, or to the keeper of that divi&s;ion, where they are to &s;uffer puni&s;hment; or they may, po&s;&s;ibly, obtain a pa&s;s to the world again; for <HI>Erlik-Khan,</HI> has a power to &s;end &s;ome departed &s;ouls
<PB N="258" REF="267">
back to their bodies, and u&s;es this means to preach re|pentance, through them, to the living part of men. And it is from the&s;e returned &s;inners, that they receive all their accounts of hell and a future life.</P>
<P>Infernal puni&s;hments, according to the opinion of Lamas, are not eternal. For each a time is fixed, but, by it's a&s;toni&s;hing duration, it is almo&s;t equal to eternity. However, it often happens, that the omni&s;cient burchan <HI>Chom&s;chin-Bodi-Sada,</HI> who is repre|&s;ented nearly like <HI>Ds&s;hakd&s;chimmuni,</HI> has mercy on depar|ted &s;ouls, or that &s;ome holy, decea&s;ed Lama, being mi&s;|lead to hell, by mi&s;take, &s;hall, by &s;ome Tangutian prayers, relea&s;e part of the tormented &s;ouls, and bring them back to happier abodes. But, it may be ea&s;ily conceived that &s;uch as have offended, either the clergy or the burchans, cannot be partakers of this fortu|nate delivery, as their puni&s;hment is never to be &s;hortened.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;ome books wonderfully endowed with the power of freeing wicked &s;ouls from their meri|ted puni&s;hment, provided they have, in the cour&s;e of their lives, diligently read them, copied them or or carried them about with them. Among the&s;e, may be numbered, one containing certain unintelligible revelations, entiltled the my&s;tery of <HI>D&s;hodbo,</HI> the con|tents of which, I am unacquainted with; yet, I have had accounts of the miraculou&s;ne&s;s of this book, in
<PB N="259" REF="268">
expelling di&s;ea&s;es, lengthening of life, bani&s;hing ma|lignant &s;pirits and delivering &s;inners from the &s;evere&s;t, infernal puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>It is evident, from the accounts here &s;et forth, on which, perhaps, I have rather dwelt too long, and which contain all the principal points of the tedious religion of the Lamas, that, like other &s;uper&s;titions, they are the fabrick of prie&s;ts, and illu&s;ions by which they contrive to awe the ignorant multitude. Thanks to &s;uper&s;tition, &s;o common to ignorant men, for the great &s;ucce&s;s of the &s;acerdotal tribe, in e&s;tabli&s;hing this religion, whereby they multiply their number, by encrea&s;ing the advantages of their clerical &s;upremacy over the di&s;ciples of Lama, and en&s;lave even nobles and princes!</P>
<P>The order of this idolatrous prie&s;thood, which is honoured with the general title of <HI>Churbrak,</HI> cannot be better compared than to that of the Roman-ca|tholicks. Their head, or Delai-Lama, may be con&s;i|dered as the Pope, except that his &s;oul is continu|ally wandering from one human body to another, and is deified. The re&s;idence of this famous man, whom the infatuated Kalmucks adore as a burchan, living up|on earth, is called, by the vulgar, <HI>Baraun-Tala;</HI> by others, <HI>Pontal,</HI> or, <HI>Batalai-La&s;&s;au.</HI> According to the reports of &s;ome Pilgrims, di&s;pached from the Kalmuck horde to this court, in matters of religious concern,
<PB N="260" REF="269">
or who travel hereby their own, holy zeal, the cloi&s;ters of Delai-Lama, into which no woman is &s;uffered to enter, are &s;ituated on a high mountain, which has been dug through in &s;uch a manner, that a &s;tream i&s;&s;ues from it's centre. It is &s;aid to contain 700 pa|god, or temples. The reader may form a better idea of the dre&s;s of the Delai-Lama from the repre&s;entation in the plate, taken from a brazen figure of this burchan, than by any de&s;cription I can give. The pointed cap is like a monk's hood, on the outer robe, and can be let down. The colour of this holy man's garment is always yellow, and they con&s;ider this, and red, as the mo&s;t &s;acred of all colours.</P>
<P>This deity they &s;uppo&s;e to be immortal, becau&s;e the &s;oul of the living Delai-Lama, when dead, pa&s;&s;es into the body of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Sometimes they have two of equal eminence and power, into both of whom the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed Delai-Lama has pa&s;&s;ed. Hence aro&s;e the Chutuchta at the head of the La|mai&s;m of China, and the Delai-Lama of Thibet. The Delai-Lama, which implies a deity at an immen&s;e di&s;tance, is honoured as a God, all his words are con|&s;idered as oracles, he appoints the chief prie&s;ts and nominates princes, he lives in a pagoda, on the mountain Potata under 29 deg. 6 min. N. latitude and 25 deg. 58 min. W. longitude from Peking; he eats no fle&s;h, &s;its always cro&s;s-legged on an altar, an&s;wers que&s;tions, and ble&s;&s;es &s;upplicants. 'His fol|lowers,'

&s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>
<Q>a&s;&s;ert, that his &s;oul, after the death of his body, pa&s;&s;es into another human body, born exactly at that time, and this man is the new Delai-Lama; others &s;ay, that they keep a young man in the pagoda, during the the life of the Delai-Lama, who is to &s;ucceed him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This religion &s;eems not of very ancient date, it is a mixture of the &s;uper&s;tition of the old Schamans with the chri&s;tian religion, as taught by the Ne&s;to|rians, the fir&s;t Delai-Lama, being no other than <HI>Pre&s;ter John,</HI> the catholicus, or Ne&s;torian patriarch, who travelled into this country to convert the &s;a|vages. The Schaman religion is the olde&s;t in India, the god of which, the Mongols call by the name D&s;hak&s;chimuni, and can be no other than the well-known <HI>Schaka</HI> or <HI>Schekia,</HI> who was born 1017 years before our Saviour, and was called, after his apo|theo&s;is, <HI>Fo:</HI> as chri&s;tianity then became more and more corrupted, it at la&s;t vani&s;hed away, and was here ab&s;orbed in the religion of Lama.</Q></P>
<P>Every prince has, in his horde, a Vice-Lama, &s;u|bordinate to the Delai-Lama, and appointed by the court at Peter&s;burgh. This per&s;on performs in his di&s;trict, what the Delai-Lama does over all the church. He ordains prie&s;ts, forgives &s;ins, be&s;tows ble&s;&s;ing and gives amulets to the dying.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="271">Among the Turgout Kalmucks is a Lama, or &s;ub|&s;titute of Delai-Lama, who&s;e place is always filled by one of the pre&s;ent, highe&s;t order of the clergy. When the Sjungor ulu&s;&s;es arrived, they had al&s;o a Lama; but I could not learn, with certainty, whether there are two &s;uch patriarchs, at pre&s;ent, in this horde, now united under the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ceptre. The garments of the&s;e Lamas differ in nothing from the former, except that the upper-robe has &s;leeves, which they put on in cold weather. They are, al&s;o, con&s;idered by the &s;illy Kalmucks as burchans, and are wor&s;hiped with out|&s;tretched arms as burchans are. The benediction a Lama gives, con&s;i&s;ts only in laying his hands upon the per&s;on he ble&s;&s;es; but I have &s;een many brazen images of Dalai-Lama him&s;elf, repre&s;ented with that di&s;play of the hands wherewith the <HI>Zord&s;hi,</HI> or Bi&s;hops, give their benediction.</P>
<P>The following is a repre&s;entation of one.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="272"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The Lama has a ulu&s;s to him&s;elf, con&s;i&s;ting of one hundred tents of prie&s;ts, and receives, be&s;ides an annual tribute, hor&s;es and camels from the lower clergy.</P>
<P>The higher order of the clergy, next the Lama, are the Zord&s;hi, which may be tran&s;lated Bi&s;hop. Their
<PB N="264" REF="273">
garments u&s;ed to be yellow or red, and they have &s;leeves in the under-garment; yet like the Lama, they wear the red order continually, and go like the latter, without breeches, that they may not defile them&s;elves, by touching any part of their body, upon certain, nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Common prie&s;ts, who compo&s;e the lower cla&s;s of regular clergy, are called <HI>Gellung,</HI> and live di&s;per&s;ed throughout the whole horde; &s;o that to every 150 or 200 tents, may be reckoned one who performs divine &s;ervice for his aimak. A gellung has nothing to live on but the little pre&s;ents his people make him on fe&s;tival and prayer-days. The&s;e prie&s;ts, and all tho&s;e that belong to them, are exempt from &s;ecular offices, and import-duties. A gellung &s;alutes his prince only by turning up his whi&s;kers. Every gellung has many &s;cho|&s;ars, <HI>(Mand&s;hi),</HI> whom he in&s;tructs in theology and the Tangutian language, and who &s;ing with him in idol-wor&s;hip, and learn to u&s;e the &s;acred in&s;truments. He has, al&s;o, a deacon or a&s;&s;i&s;tant, called <HI>Gad&s;ul,</HI> to which office he may appoint any of his &s;cholars, but a man cannot be ordained a prie&s;t, but by a par|ticular form, and at the re&s;idence of the Lama.</P>
<P>They have another eccle&s;ia&s;tical officer, corre&s;pon|ding with our &s;exton or ve&s;try-keeper. He attends only on the higher order of the clergy, and takes care of a magnificent tent, erected for the a&s;&s;embling of
<PB N="265" REF="274">
the burchans. This lower order of prie&s;ts, does not differ from the Kalmucks in dre&s;s, except that their heads are &s;haved all over, not wearing that tuft of hair behind, which the lay Kalmucks do. The heads of all their &s;cholars are &s;o &s;haven at their admi&s;&s;ion, and with a degree of ceremony. Neither have they any fringed appendage to their caps. Like the &s;upe|rior order of clergy, they take a vow of celibacy and continence, but a <HI>Mand&s;hi,</HI> or &s;cholar, before he is ordained, may, with &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion of his prie&s;t, quit the &s;acred profe&s;&s;ion and marry.</P>
<P>As divine &s;ervice, among the Kalmucks, is per|formed throughout in the Tangutian language, every prie&s;t mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, be able to read it, and be provi|ded with tho&s;e prayers and &s;ongs, requi&s;ite for every hour and day and occa&s;ional &s;olemnity; and in every prie&s;t's habitation is found a variety of Mongalian writings, in which are de&s;cribed the idolatrous cere|monies. Be&s;ides the offices u&s;ed in &s;ickne&s;s, funerals and the like, they have certain ceremonies of exorci&s;m, called <HI>Tarni,</HI> by which they pretend to cure di&s;ea&s;es. Medicine they know little of; their chief remedies are prayers and certain amulets. Each Kalmuck wears an amulet, hanging on his bare bo&s;om, &s;ewed up in a piece of leather, which he receives from his prie&s;t. I have &s;een large pieces of cotton-&s;tuff, on which was printed all kind of in&s;ignificant, coloured fi|gures, to each of which was added a Tangutian exorci&s;m,
<PB N="266" REF="275">
with an in&s;cription in Mongalian, for what purpo&s;es it it may be u&s;ed. The prints that make the&s;e figures are kept by the prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>No prie&s;t can be without the a&s;trological books of of his religion, from which he a&s;certains au&s;picious days and hours for certain acts and events, which every Kalmuck applys to his prie&s;t for information in, before he undertakes any thing of con&s;equence. It is confi|dently &s;aid, that the flight of a certain, white owl <HI>(&s;trix nyctea)</HI> which inhabits the &s;teps, foretells good or ill fortune, according as it flies, to the right or left. If, when they &s;ee him, he directs his flight to the left, they endeavour to turn him to the right, and fancy this will give a change to fate.</P>
<P>The large&s;t and mo&s;t important book, in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Kalmuck prie&s;ts, and which is &s;aid to contain an accurate and full account of their idols, is entitled <HI>Bodimer:</HI> but, I heard of an abridgment of the whole mythology of Lama, called <HI>Ertjunzjun-Toali.</HI></P>
<P>The common prie&s;ts, have their idols with them, in their tents, which are generally made of white felts, it being ordained, that a burchan &s;hall inhabit no other; they are kept, with their religious books, in &s;mall trunks and are put under the bed&s;ted; but the be&s;t burchans are &s;et up in ca&s;es above. Before the
<PB N="267" REF="276">
trunks, in which the&s;e idols are, &s;tands a little table, or altar, on which are always eight or nine little, &s;ilver bowls, and a lamp or lanthorn. On the fire-hearth is an|other bowl made of iron, fa&s;tened on an iron bar &s;tuck into the ground. Into this bowl, the gellung pours &s;ome drops of all the liquor he intends to u&s;e in &s;acrifice and never drinks any from any bowl, but his own, without pronouncing the&s;e words, <HI>Om a chum.</HI> That is
<Q>may all be pure; God give abundance, and pro&s;per this drink.</Q>
They have &s;everal other laconic forms of prayer. In this burchan's tent &s;leeps the gellung and his gadful, or &s;ome of his &s;cholars.</P>
<P>The Kalmucks keep three days in each month &s;acred. As the&s;e days are regulated by the moon, and they begin the month with the new moon, their fir&s;t, general &s;up|plication-day, is the eighth after the new moon; the &s;econd is on the fifteenth, and the third on the thirtieth. On &s;uch day no zealous Kalmuck eats or drinks any thing but what is made of milk, and &s;pends be&s;t part of the day near the tent of his prie&s;t, to which they are called to wor&s;hip in the morning, by the beating of a kettle-drum, and a kind of wooden or copper trumpet. None dare come near the tent, but the nobles and the learned. A multitude, of both &s;exes, &s;its round about, and drops from ro&s;aries, which they hold in their hands, one bead after another, pro|nouncing at each, <HI>Om ma wie pad, me chum,</HI> with their
<PB N="268" REF="277">
eyes &s;hut, or rehear&s;ing, with a low voice, another &s;hort form of prayer, which they have by heart, without knowing it's meaning. The more quiet the people are, the more noi&s;y is the prie&s;t in wor&s;hip, and, with his red robe and crown of ro&s;es, he cuts no &s;mall figure. Long &s;trips of cotton, on which are written Tangutian prayers and fa&s;tened at the end of high poles, are &s;tuck up before the tent, by way of flag; from an opinion, that the waving motion of &s;uch prayers in the wind, are as efficacious as a recital of them. (See a repre&s;entation of a tomb &s;o adorned in the plate Kalmucks). Before the burchans burns a light, and the above-mentioned little bowls are filled with dried meat, chee&s;e or other victuals; there are al&s;o &s;ome large bowls filled with the &s;ame. They al&s;o lay down before the altar of the burchans, grits, milk &amp;c. It is a crime among the Kalmucks, to pa&s;s by &s;uch a bowl, and I &s;aw they were di&s;plea&s;ed with me, for &s;o doing. Rich prie&s;ts place &s;mall, frankincen&s;e candles upon their altars, before the burchans, but poor ones are content to &s;trew, at the commencement of their prayers, which la&s;t the whole day, &s;ome frankincen&s;e on burning cow|dung, &s;upported by an iron trivet. On the&s;e days the burchans, in &s;plendid dre&s;s, are expo&s;ed to the people, by placing them on the trunk before the altar, and &s;ome &s;mall rags of green, red, or yellow &s;ilk, are hung over their &s;houlders, by way of cloak; add to this, all the paper-paintings which the prie&s;t po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es, are hung up within the tent, as banners of their &s;aints.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="278">The prie&s;t him&s;elf, who performs the &s;ervice or the gods, &s;its in his u&s;ual place bare-headed, his brea&s;t uncovered, the red, &s;acerdotal tippet over his &s;houlders, and a ro&s;ary about his neck. Before the prie&s;t &s;tands a little bench, on which is another bowl with water, an elegant metal bell, with a handle, a &s;mall &s;ceptre, which repre&s;ents the bur|chans, and two plates; near it &s;it, or &s;tand in a row, his ged&s;ul and his &s;cholars, chori&s;ters, all bare-head|ed, with red bands over their &s;houlders. The&s;e bawl out the hymn as loud as po&s;&s;ible, from written &s;heets before them, or play on in&s;truments, to increa&s;e the noi&s;e of the &s;ingers. The in&s;truments con&s;i&s;t of great kettle-drums; a kind of hautboy, made of a human &s;hin-bone, with a copper vent-hole and a mouth-piece which gives a &s;hrilling &s;ound; and an in&s;trument in the form of plates, u&s;ed by the Jani&s;&s;aries, which the prie&s;t him&s;elf, &s;ometimes takes in hand. It may ea&s;ily be con|ceived what an odious noi&s;e the&s;e mu&s;t make, e&s;pecially at the court of Lama, where there is a va&s;t many of them, joined in chorus by a multitude of prie&s;ts, holding their little bells in their left-hands and the &s;acerdotal &s;ceptres between the two middle-fingers and thumb of the right-hand. I &s;aw &s;ome metal bells u&s;ed on &s;imilar occa|&s;ion, the clappers of which were leather bags filled with &s;and, but which gave a &s;trong &s;ound. The Lama, is &s;aid to &s;it motionle&s;s &s;urrounded by his bi&s;hops during the &s;ervice. The bi&s;hops give the ble&s;&s;ing, with &s;uch a ge&s;ture as is repre&s;ented in the idol.

<P>But to return to the Kalmuck religion. Be&s;ides the three days of &s;upplication mentioned, the Kalmucks have three, great fe&s;tivals, celebrated with all tho&s;e amu&s;ements the reader will be more acquainted with. The fir&s;t, and mo&s;t important, is that on which they begin their new year. They call it <HI>Zachan-Sara</HI> (the white day), or <HI>Chaburun-Turn-Sara</HI> (the fir&s;t day of &s;pring) and it commences with the fir&s;t new moon in April; the next important begins with the fir&s;t new moon in June, and is called <HI>S&s;aga-&s;sara</HI> or <HI>Suni-Turun-Sara,</HI> (the beginning of &s;ummer). At this time, for a fortnight, the Kalmucks take as much flour to their prie&s;t as they can afford, of which they get round cakes made in the form of a cone. I &s;aw, in the tents of
<PB N="273" REF="282">
&s;ome gellungs, brazen moulds of them, ornamented with &s;ome in&s;ignificant characters, and fa&s;tened on wood|en-handles. When they are baked and have &s;tood &s;ome time before the burchans, they are thrown into water. When a man is &s;ick, even at other times of the year, he gets a figure made in dough, either a man, an ox, a dog, &amp;c. agreeable to the advice of his gellung, or &s;ome holy book, which, having &s;tood &s;ome time before the burchan, is to be thrown either into the fire or water, in order to appea&s;e the malig|nant &s;pirit who has cau&s;ed the &s;ickne&s;s. The&s;e figures are called <HI>Zaza.</HI></P>
<P>The third fea&s;t is in November, or begins with the new moon in December, and is called <HI>Uwilin-Turun-Sara</HI> (the commencement of winter) or <HI>Sulain-Sara,</HI> as they burn at this &s;olemnity a kind of holy candles, brought from Thibet by the pilgrims, which candles thev call <HI>Sula.</HI> I was not made acquainted with all the particular ceremonies, u&s;ed at the&s;e fea&s;ts, but I will mention a few.</P>
<P>There is nothing more peculiar in the Kalmuck wor&s;hip, than the u&s;e of a little ve&s;&s;el, &s;imilar to our coffee-pots, called <HI>Bumba,</HI> which on every day of public &s;ervice, is wound round with a white band, ornamented with phea&s;ants and peacocks feathers, and &s;et upon the altar of the burchans near the lanthorn. This little pot is filled with &s;weet water to which the Kalmucks
<PB N="274" REF="283">
attribute a miraculous virtue. On &s;uch fea&s;t and prayer-days, every faithful Kalmuck has a few drops of this water poured on the palm of his hand, which he de|voutly and confidently licks up, as a pre&s;ervative again&s;t many evils. Gellungs generally give a cup of this &s;weet water to the &s;ick, and one, for a trifling piece of money, which I laid upon the altar, would fain have per&s;uaded me to drink &s;ome of it, &s;aying it would do me good. Every thing that is placed upon the altars is &s;acred, and mu&s;t not be touched, e&s;pecially on fe&s;|tivals. When I attempted to take hold of a burchan, to in&s;pect it clo&s;er, the gellung &s;pread his &s;ilk rag, in which he u&s;ed to wrap up his idol, over my hands, and if he had either eat or drank, he would have wa&s;h|ed his hands and turned up his beard, before he touched the burchan.</P>
<P>Still more remarkable are a &s;ort of &s;acred pills, brought from Thibet. It is the noble only and the rich, who can obtain them from the prie&s;ts, in ca&s;es of &s;ickne&s;s, and when death &s;eems almo&s;t unavoidable. They are taken to alienate the &s;oul from this world and &s;anctify it. The&s;e pills are black and about the &s;ize of a pea. I thought they might have contained &s;ome opiate, but was told they were of a purgative kind.</P>
<P>At the tents of &s;ome old prie&s;ts I &s;aw a kind of pray|er-wheel, repre&s;enting a parti-coloured cylinder, with iron axles, containing written prayers; it is fixed on a
<PB N="275" REF="284">
wooden frame, and turned quickly round with a &s;tring wound about it, each motion of a written prayer being con&s;idered as efficacious as a rehear&s;al of it.</P>
<P>Little, cylindrical boxes, or wheels, full of written prayers, wound round a &s;tick, are di&s;tributed by prie&s;ts to &s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;tic per&s;ons, as through a holy rage have determined to go on &s;ome pilgrimage, or lead a holy and &s;olitary life. Such hermits and pil|grims mu&s;t not eat any thing but meat, grits or roots. After this pilgrimage, they conclude their life in &s;ancti|ty, placing over their tents a blue flag, on which are written &s;ome Tangutian prayer, and as often as they mean to pray, they turn about their cylinder. After every turn of the wheel, they pronounce the &s;ix words, <HI>om ma wie pad, me chum.</HI></P>
<P>It is al&s;o frequent among the Torgouts, that hu&s;|bands, weary of life or crazed with holine&s;s, &s;hall for&s;ake their wives, their children and e&s;tates, in order to be prie&s;ts. In this ca&s;e, they pa&s;s through a kind of novice|&s;hip, that is, their hair mu&s;t be cut and they mu&s;t be con&s;ecrated ged&s;ulls. All the Dsjungorians I a&s;ked, told me, there was no &s;uch thing among them; but many of the Torgouts, with a holy zeal, a&s;&s;ured me &s;uch an action was plea&s;ing to God.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o among the Kalmucks, certain ma|gicians or <HI>Schamans,</HI> not belonging to the prie&s;ts or
<PB N="276" REF="285">
or holy people, but rather abhorred than revered; and their arts, which are prohibited, are often dreaded. The&s;e are men and women of the lower cla&s;s of people. The former are called <HI>Uduguhn,</HI> and the latter <HI>Boh.</HI> They exerci&s;e their &s;orcery once a month, the night when the moon is new. They &s;teep a particular plant in a bowl of water, with which they fir&s;t &s;prinkle their tents; next they take certain, dried roots in each hand, kindle them, and, with extended arms, make all kind of ge&s;tures and violent contortions of the body, repeating the following &s;yllables, <HI>D&s;chi Eje, Jo jo,</HI> till they fall into an apparent phrenzy, when they begin to an&s;wer que&s;tions, re&s;pecting things lo&s;t and future events.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to tho&s;e profane cu&s;toms, con|nected with their religion. When a woman is in la|bour, they &s;end for a prie&s;t, who attends near the tent and reads &s;ome Tangutian prayers. During this time, and till the child is born, the hu&s;band of the woman is to &s;pread a net round his tent, and continually fight the air with a cudgel, crying <HI>Gart t&s;chetkirr!</HI> (avaunt devil!) in order to keep off the internal agent. A|mong the rich, they place &s;uch a number of praying prie&s;ts, on guard round the tent, as are &s;ufficient to drive off the malignant &s;pirits. During the birth, they have not only women but men-midwives, who take the child and wa&s;h it. The women are &s;o &s;trong that they are often &s;een to ride out the &s;econd day af|ter
<PB N="277" REF="286">
they are brought to bed, and to follow their bu&s;i|ne&s;s; but, they cannot appear, otherwi&s;e than with their heads veiled, or be pre&s;ent at divine wor&s;hip, till after forty days.</P>
<P>The common cla&s;s of Kalmucks give their children the fir&s;t remarkable name they hear, or the name of the fir&s;t man, or animal, which the father meets after the birth. But the wealthy get the prie&s;t to &s;tudy for a name from &s;ome holy book, which, if the father is not plea&s;ed with, he alters. When a boy has reached four years of age, he undergoes a kind of confirmati|on. He is brought before the gellung, who reads &s;ome prayers over him and cuts off &s;ome of his hair, which the mother is to pick carefully up and carry home, wrapt up with an amulet, hanging on her back. I could never find out the meaning of this ceremony.</P>
<P>Not having had an opportunity of being pre&s;ent at any of the marriages of the Kalmucks, I can &s;peak only from hear-&s;ay. Many betroth their children, not only in their earlie&s;t infancy, but in the womb; this be|trothing is, however, &s;acredly performed and condition|al, that &s;uch a one has a boy and &s;uch a one a girl. The young couple are joined at fourteen years of age, or later. Two years before marriage, a bridegroom is allowed to take many little liberties with his bride, but &s;hould pregnancy happen before the day of marriage, an atonement is made to the bride's parents, by pre|&s;ents.
<PB N="278" REF="287">
Prior to the wedding, the bridegroom agrees with the girl's father, as to the portion he is to have with her, which con&s;i&s;ts in a certain number of hor&s;es and cattle; and the father of the young man, in re|turn, pre&s;ents the bride with a new, white felt-tent, &s;ome hou&s;ehold furniture, bed-cloaths and ornamented feet-pillows, covered with cotton or &s;ilk, and laced. The gellung is con&s;ulted, with re&s;pect to the day of marriage, and he &s;earches, by a&s;tronomical calculati|ons, for a propitious one. The new tent is then erected; the bride, with her parents and relations, goes to the bridegroom, who, with the gellung or prie&s;t, accompanies them to the tent, where he reads &s;ome few prayers and orders the bride's tre&s;&s;es to be undone and braided in the manner of married women, into two tails. He next takes the caps of the married couple, retires with them and his gadful without the tent, &s;mokes them with frankincen&s;e, &s;ays a prayer, then returns to the couple, ble&s;&s;es them, gives the caps to &s;ome of the per&s;ons pre&s;ent, to put them on the bride and bridegroom's head, and the ceremony concludes with a fea&s;t. For a certain time the bride is not per|mitted to leave her tent, and no one is &s;uffered to &s;ee her, but her mother and the married women of her ac|quaintance.</P>
<P>At the nuptials of princes, great entertainments are given. A large banquet is prepared, and tho&s;e who carry the eatables to table, which are &s;erved up in large,
<PB N="279" REF="288">
wooden ve&s;&s;els, are preceded by a herald or carver, riding on a fox-coloured hor&s;e, &s;plendidly dre&s;&s;ed, having over his &s;houlders a long tippet of fine, white linen, and his cap trimmed with black fox or otter|fur. On the wedding-day, all the prie&s;ts of the ulu&s;s read prayers, and the day is concluded with a variety of amu&s;ements, as hor&s;e-racing, wre&s;tling, &s;hooting with the bow, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tomary diver&s;ions of this carele&s;s and blith|&s;ome people, con&s;i&s;t in hor&s;e-racing, in which the girls bear a part; &s;hooting with the bow for wagers; wre&s;tling, in which they &s;trip them&s;elves to their trow|&s;ers; (indeed, the men and boys, among the com|mon people, in &s;ummer-time, go about naked, ex|cept a pair of trow&s;ers); hearing the maidens &s;ing; pantomimic dances, and mu&s;ic performed by the girls, who almo&s;t all of them play on the lute, the kit and the viol, a kind of hurdy-gurdy and the pipe. The &s;ubjects of their &s;ongs are the fabulous &s;tories of gigantic chivalry, heroic tales, and amorous ditties; but their melody is har&s;h and di&s;mal. The Kalmucks al&s;o play at che&s;s, cards and tocadillo, much as we do.</P>
<P>The nobles eat upon a carpet &s;pread on the ground. One cuts all the meat and the re&s;t &s;eize on it with their bare hands; when it is &s;wallowed, they drink the liquor it was boiled in. It would &s;eem that cleanline&s;s with them was a &s;in, being forbidden to wa&s;h any ve&s;|&s;el
<PB N="280" REF="289">
in river-water, of cour&s;e they wipe them only with a piece of old &s;heep-&s;kin, on which they wipe their hands when dirty. As they dare not put any living creature to death, their habitations abound in all kinds of &s;mall vermin.</P>
<P>According to the principles of the Kalmuck religion, polygamy is prohibited, but this law is not &s;o rigor|ou&s;ly ob&s;erved by nobles and commanders, who, &s;ome|times, will have two or three wives. Such examples, however, rarely occur. Divorces are likewi&s;e unlaw|ful, yet they happen frequently among their people of di&s;tinction. If a Kalmuck has any rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;a|tisfied with his wife, or if &s;he is her&s;elf de&s;irous of a divorce, the hu&s;band has only to &s;trip her of her cloaths and the divorce takes place; but he, &s;ome|times, even whips her away. If he wi&s;hes to acquit him&s;elf honourably, he invites her relations to a ban|quet, gives his wife a &s;addle-hor&s;e and as much cattle as he plea&s;es or can afford, and &s;he quits him, with her friends, taking this property with her.</P>
<P>When a Kalmuck dies, the gellung is made ac|quainted with the moment in which the decea&s;ed gave up his &s;pirit. He then judges in which of the twelve hours, wherein they divide their day and night, the decea&s;ed left the world and ordains accordingly, from a book, the manner in which the corp&s;e is to be car|ried and to what di&s;trict of heaven, and the relations
<PB N="281" REF="290">
carry it accordingly. There are &s;ix different modes of burial, one is to lay the corp&s;e, naked, in the open &s;tep, with the head towards the ea&s;t and the body in a &s;leeping po&s;ition, &s;upporting the head with the right arm. At the head, on both &s;ides, and al&s;o at the feet, they &s;tick poles into the ground, on the top of which are fa&s;tened &s;quare pieces of &s;tuff, &s;cribbled over full with Tangutian prayers, which re&s;emble flags and are called prayer-flags. The &s;econd mode is to carry the corp&s;e to &s;ome adjacent wood, dre&s;&s;ed in the dre&s;s of the country. In both the above ca&s;es, the body is left to be devoured by wild bea&s;ts, by which proce&s;s, they &s;uppo&s;e the &s;oul continues it's tran&s;migration. The third way is to throw the body into the water, this they do with children; the fourth, to bury it; the fifth, to cover it with a heap of &s;tones; and, the &s;ixth, to burn it. In the fir&s;t five modes, in which they bury the common people and lower order of prie&s;ts, they &s;tick one flag as near the body as they can, bu|rying with them the weapons of the decea&s;ed and &s;ome few pre&s;ents. Be&s;ides the&s;e prayers of the dead, a kind of &s;oul-ma&s;s is read by the prie&s;t for the decea&s;ed, by order of the parents, agreeable to the hour in which he gave up his &s;pirit. The&s;e ma&s;&s;es continue forty-nine days, at the expiration of which, three prayer-flags are given to the parents by the gellung, which they al&s;o &s;tick near the corp&s;e and then leave it to it&s;elf, without any farther notice. Some, however, will continue the ma&s;&s;es a while longer. From the
<PB N="282" REF="291">
hour of departure, they judge whether the decea&s;ed was a good or a wicked man, and if the body remains un|mole&s;ted by the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t, they con&s;ider it as an ill omen.</P>
<P>Burning the dead, is only practi&s;ed for the &s;uperior ranks of clergy or lamas, the nojons or princes, and a few holy people, whom they believe in the regenera|tion of. The a&s;hes of &s;uch bodies are carefully col|lected, mixed with frankincen&s;e and &s;ent to the Delai-Lama, at Thibet, who &s;ends word back into which paradi&s;e the new-born &s;oul is arrived through the fire, without being metamorpho&s;ed into an animal. In or|der to burn them, a vaulted oven is built with holes, in one of which the body, full-dre&s;&s;ed, is laid upon a bench with three feet. The fire blazes out of the oven and is fed with the fat of the body till it is en|tirely con&s;umed. The following mode of interring a Kalmuck lady, I learnt from one of their own people. Prince <HI>Ondou,</HI> who is &s;till living, had a Truckmenian wife, who begged the favour, when dying, to be bu|ried in the ground according to the cu&s;tom of her an|ce&s;tors. In conformity with her reque&s;t, &s;he was buri|ed up to her &s;houlders, but over her bare head a felt|tent was erected, and the corp&s;e &s;o left.</P>

me, I left Jaizkoi-Gorodok for Gurjef, one of the mo&s;t &s;outhern di&s;tricts of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire, and abounding with natural curio&s;ities.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that as I travelled &s;outhward, I met, among the meadow-plants of the low-lands, &s;e|veral I had not &s;een before, and which are only to be looked for in the warmer di&s;tricts of Europe and A&s;ia. On &s;o varied a &s;cene, I could not but recollect the opinion of <HI>Strahlenberg,</HI> who, with great rea&s;on, con|&s;iders the cro&s;s-mountains, which ri&s;e from the Glaci|al-&s;ea to the farthe&s;t arms of the Ural, as the natural boundary between Europe and northern A&s;ia. The &s;tep-mountains, as an immediate continuation of the decrea&s;ing and dividing Ural, which extends it&s;elf be|tween the Jaik and the Samara, &s;outh-we&s;t towards the Wolga, naturally &s;eparate here the more northern di&s;|tricts, exhibiting a hilly and fertile land, over&s;pread with European plants, from the A&s;iatic &s;teps.</P>
<P>About five miles from Jaizkoi-Gorodok, is a very exten&s;ive and bu&s;hy valley, where, among other &s;hrubs, I found the wild-ro&s;e, the fal&s;e acacia and the greater meadow-&s;weet, which &s;hot forth rods &s;ix feet long, and which, in this country, are u&s;ed for &s;witches, on account of their toughne&s;s and flexibility. This place abounded with the curious in&s;ect called the &s;tinking beetle, <HI>(tenebrio variabilis)</HI> and a kind of earth-mo&s;s that covers the loamy &s;urface of the &s;tep,
<PB N="284" REF="293">
in whole tracts, as with a white-grey bark, which breaks where the ground is particularly dry. The Co&s;&s;acks call it <HI>Semljanoi chleb,</HI> (earth-bread), and &s;ay that many a per&s;on, out a hunting, has lo&s;t his life, by being obliged to feed upon this mo&s;s. About the Jaik, they u&s;e it as a medicine, but here they are ignorant of it's u&s;e.</P>
<P>Continuing my journey to the next guard-&s;tation, I there changed hor&s;es and had time to look about me, where I found the Awrag, a water-arm, full of all forts of wild-fowl, and abounding with the bee-eater <HI>(merops).</HI> Water-tortoi&s;es are here uncommonly large, I &s;aw one half an ell acro&s;s the back, and this &s;ize is &s;aid to be the lea&s;t. The common people be|lieve that the bite of this animal is venemous, and that it generally bites people while bathing, in their pri|vate parts. It is often found caught in fi&s;hing nets and ba&s;ket-work. I found here, al&s;o, a particular kind of &s;hells, which grow together in bunches, and which, to my knowledge, are found no where but in the Wolga, the Jaik and the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, <HI>(Mytulus polymorphus).</HI></P>
<P>We &s;aw now, for the fir&s;t time, upon the Jaik, up|wards of twenty of the &s;poon-bill <HI>(pelecanus onocrotalus),</HI> which the natives call <HI>baba,</HI> (old woman). They were very bu&s;y, fi&s;hing. It is well known, yet de|&s;erves to be repeated, that the&s;e enormous fowls a&s;&s;em|ble
<PB N="285" REF="294">
in lakes and bays, form a long row, and &s;preading out their wings all at once, drive the fi&s;h together, which they &s;wallow up in great quantities. Their time of fi&s;hing is about dawn and noon, and it is ea&s;ily to be conceived how much a flock of &s;uch fowls will thin a water of fi&s;h. They weigh here from eighteen to twenty-five pounds each, mea&s;ure from the point of the bill to the top of the tail about five feet, and from the extremity of one wing to the other, when &s;pread, about nine feet and a half. If the&s;e fowls are di&s;turbed, they &s;oar high in the air, and fly in long, cro&s;s-waving lines; and, even when &s;hot at, &s;hew not the lea&s;t con|fu&s;ion. From their whitene&s;s they glitter as they fly, and though they live on fi&s;h their fle&s;h is not indeli|cate. I enquired here about the wandering gra&s;s-hop|pers, which are natives of the de&s;arts of A&s;ia, and was told that they did not come regularly every year, nor did they always make their way from the &s;ame quarter; &s;ometimes they come from the Kirgui&s;ian, &s;ometimes from the we&s;tern, Kalmuck di&s;trict, and &s;ometimes from the north, up the river Jaik, and return the &s;ame way. They arrive in the time of hay-harve&s;t, and de&s;troy many a fine crop.</P>
<P>To the next guard-&s;tation, I rode all night, and it was very &s;ultry, owing to the burning of a Kirgue&s;e &s;tep, which had continued ten days, and though very di&s;tant, had heated the air all round; before the moon ro&s;e, we &s;aw the light of this fire at ea&s;t, and, in the
<PB N="286" REF="295">
day-time, it could be perceived by a column of &s;moke, on which &s;eemed to re&s;t an oblong cloud.</P>
<P>In this di&s;trict, on a &s;alt-&s;tep, e&s;pecially where the liquorice grows, is found a u&s;eful plant, <HI>(&s;erratula a|mara),</HI> a kind of bitterwort, which contains &s;o &s;trong a bitter, that it is preferable in medicine to the cen|taury. The Co&s;&s;acks a&s;&s;ured me, that they had ra|pidly and radically cured cold fevers with it, and that it would cure in cattle the dangerous bites of badgers, wolves and mad dogs, by &s;crewing it powdered upon the wound. <HI>Buxbaum</HI> &s;eems to have de&s;cribed this plant by the name <HI>gacea erecta, minor latioribus fol&uuml;s.</HI> As there is plenty of water-fowl in the river Jaik, the inhabitants are pe&s;tered with birds of prey; the com|mon &s;ea-eagle <HI>(&s;kopa),</HI> the large, black eagle <HI>(aquila o&s;&s;ifraga)</HI> and another little &s;pecies, with a &s;potted head, hitherto unde&s;cribed, <HI>(aquila leucorypha),</HI> have ne&s;ts almo&s;t in every high tree.</P>
<P>About noon, on the 15th of Augu&s;t, I reached Kalmykowa, a &s;ort or guard-&s;tation, at the di&s;tance of about 209 miles from Jaizkoi-Gorodok, where I &s;taid a few days, to make &s;ome little excur&s;ions in the neighbourhood. Here have been found, in the Jaik, elephant and buffalo-&s;keletons, proofs of &s;ome old change in the globe, of which I &s;hall &s;peak further hereafter. They have pre&s;erved in Kalmykowa, a piece of elephant's tooth calcined, a mon&s;trous ele|phant
<PB N="287" REF="296">
hip-bone, which weighed fifty-four pounds, and the upper-part of an extraordinary, great buffalo's &s;kull, with both horns, which mea&s;ured, between the bottom-part of the horns, one foot three inches, Pari&s;i|an mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>On the &s;teps here grow abundantly, the &s;tinking ground-pine, <HI>(camphoro&s;ma mon&s;peliaca),</HI> which had not the lea&s;t &s;mell, and &s;ome &s;mall pieces of wormwood, on which the numerous flocks of the Kirgue&s;e feed in winter; the&s;e plants continue green under the &s;now, which falls but lightly in this di&s;trict and is &s;oon gone. The &s;heep dig them readily from under the &s;now, and the Kirgue&s;e look out for winter-quarters, where this plant abounds; for the &s;heep will not touch it in &s;um|mer. Here grows, al&s;o, the rhapontic, of which the Co&s;&s;acks make an excellent medicine, by &s;teeping it in baandy, to which it gives a pale, yellow colour. In Gurjef, they collect the young leaves in &s;pring and eat them, as a cure for the &s;curvy, which there reigns. A decoction of it, is a whole&s;ome purgative, and they ap|ply it in a variety of di&s;orders. The Kirgue&s;e u&s;e it to dye yellow with, and I am per&s;uaded it would &s;uper|cede the u&s;e of the foreign turmerick.</P>
<P>There is here, the &s;corpion-&s;pider, <HI>(phalangium araneoides),</HI> known by all the Kalmucks, by the name of <HI>bychorcho</HI> or <HI>mand&s;chi-bychorcho,</HI> and dreaded by them exceedingly, it's bite not only occa&s;ioning extra|ordinary
<PB N="288" REF="297">
pain, but a great tumour, which, though &s;low in operation, is certain death. This in&s;ect lives in holes under ground, but creeps about in the reeds and often awakes, with a bite, tho&s;e imprudent peo|ple who lie down to &s;leep where they are. The Kal|mucks and all tho&s;e who have &s;een it alive &s;ay, that it will, in the twinkling of an eye, run up a &s;tick, held before it, and bite the hand. It's common antidote and cure is &s;weet oil, but the Kalmucks u&s;e &s;ome &s;u|per&s;titious remedies again&s;t it. They &s;ay, the wound &s;hould be fir&s;t bathed with the milk of a young woman, &s;uckling her fir&s;t child, and who lived cha&s;tely before marriage; that then the heart and lungs of &s;ome black animal, either a dog, a &s;heep, &amp;c. &s;hould be applied warm as taken from the body, to the wound. I &s;aw an old Kalmuck, who had two marks on his brea&s;t, made by the bites of the&s;e animals, and who &s;aid, he was waked from his &s;leep by the violence of the pain. Nay, the Kalmucks dread this in&s;ect &s;o much, that they will de&s;ert a di&s;trict where they have &s;een them. I had once an opportunity of getting one from the cape of Good-Hope, but never knew it's violent effects till now. The Kalmucks &s;ay, that there is another &s;uch black in&s;ect, living under ground and &s;pinning large and exten&s;ive webs, but I could never learn further particulars about it.</P>
<P>Upon the height of Kalmykowa, two good journeys on hor&s;eback from the Jaik, is an exten&s;ive &s;alt-lake,
<PB N="289" REF="298">
forming many little bays and mar&s;hes, but has no flux. It is called Kamy&s;ch-Samara. It's borders are full of bull-ru&s;hes, on who&s;e roots the wild boars feed. On this lake are eight or ten floating i&s;lands, the tex|ture of which is compo&s;ed of all &s;orts of roots, ru&s;hes and willows, and inhabited by wild boars, &s;wans and divers &s;orts of water-fowl.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 17. I returned to the fort, and the next day took a ride to &s;ee the Kirgue&s;e, who were quartered in the neighbourhood, and, at &s;un-&s;et, took notice of the race-hare, or flying-hare <HI>(mus laculus).</HI> This animal appears rather flying than running. The fleete&s;t hor&s;es of our Co&s;&s;ack e&s;cort, could not keep up with them. With a &s;ingle leap they will jump over twelve feet of ground, and they &s;carce touch the ground but we &s;ee them again in the air, till they ru&s;h into their holes.</P>
<P>Day was ju&s;t declining, when we reached the Kir|gue&s;e, who were quartered on a &s;tep or wa&s;te, under large, felt tents, on a delightful &s;pot. The &s;tep-nati|ons &s;hew, commonly, a great deal of ta&s;te in choo&s;ing their abodes and in this re&s;pect, enjoy a plea&s;ure that, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, atones for their un&s;ettled, vagrant way of life. The&s;e people &s;eemed more alarmed at us, than we at them. We &s;aw no one about the tents, but a few old women and &s;ome naked children, run|ning about a kitchen-fire; the young women had ab|&s;codned,
<PB N="290" REF="299">
and the men were bu&s;y in collecting their di&s;per&s;ed flocks. As &s;oon as their bu&s;ine&s;s was done, both ma&s;ters and &s;laves gathered them&s;elves about us, and finding us peaceably inclined and of an agreeable di&s;po&s;ition, received us with a &s;miling countenance and treated us with a delicious, though &s;ouri&s;h, drink, made of mares-milk<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This drink, if prepared in clean ve&s;&s;els, as the Kir|gue&s;e do it, is not in the lea&s;t di&s;agreeable, but has that vinous, &s;ouri&s;h ta&s;te, which milk has, when turned to curds with cream of tartar. The kumy&s;s of cows-milk is much inferior to that made with the milk of mares; tho' when fre&s;h, it is rather &s;alti&s;h, &s;omething like the milk of a cow, who has eaten &s;ome alkali or dame's violet, <HI>(al|liaria).</HI></NOTE>, and called by them, <HI>kumy&s;s,</HI> of which no one could drink a bottle without being intox|icated; a proof of this I &s;aw in one of my attendants. Notwith&s;tanding the good reception we met with and the ho&s;pitality they &s;hewed, we did not think it proper to take up our night's lodging among them, therefore, about du&s;k, having in&s;pected into what was mo&s;t re|markable in their families, we took our leave and re|turned from whence we came; where, for the fir&s;t time this year, I &s;aw the unexpected comet, which the Co&s;&s;acks, with their lynx eyes, had di&s;covered three nights before, and on the 15th in&s;tant, (Aug. 1769), a little below the hyades.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="300">As I owe my readers every account I could collect about the Kirgue&s;e, I now take the opportunity of re|lating to them all I could learn.</P>
<P>This nation of people calls it&s;elf <HI>Kergis Cha&s;ak,</HI> by which name it is known among the Ru&s;&s;ians and Kal|mucks. They, them&s;elves, gave me the following account of their origin. They formerly lived among the Turks alone, and propagated and extended them|&s;elves as far as the river Euphrates, where they had their own particular governors; the la&s;t of whom, <HI>Sa&s;yd-Khan,</HI> had been in this di&s;trict. This prince de&s;igned to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the Turki&s;h throne, and, with this view, murdered two of Mahomet's cou&s;ins, by his daughter Fatima, called Cha&s;an and Chu&s;&s;an. I am not much ver&s;ed in Turki&s;h hi&s;tory, but was I ever &s;o much, and whether the &s;tory be found true or fal&s;e, I &s;hould relate it, as I heard it: it is a piece of Kirgui&s;ian antiquity. When the deed had tran&s;pired, the Turks ro&s;e in arms, and drove him and all the Kirgue&s;e from their &s;ettlements. After this, they &s;at down in the neighbourhood of the No|gayan Tartars, but having al&s;o fallen out with the&s;e people, they were again driven from the &s;tep or de&s;art which they now occupy. This horde, afterwards, threw it&s;elf under the protection of Kergis-Khan, who&s;e &s;ubjects were neighbours to the Sungarians and Chine&s;e, (probably the Mongols), and this prince employed them in wars and military expeditions; but
<PB N="292" REF="301">
they for&s;ook him al&s;o, and retired to their pre&s;ent a|bode, with the name of <HI>Kergis-Cha&s;ak,</HI> which implies a warrior of Kergis-Khan. They believe, indeed, that all the Ru&s;&s;ian Co&s;&s;acks derive their name and military di&s;cipline from them.</P>
<P>The&s;e Kirgue&s;e, like all other A&s;iatic nomades, live in felt-tents, not at all different from tho&s;e of the Kal|mucks, but in being cleanlier and &s;o &s;pacious that of|ten above twenty per&s;ons may &s;it commodiou&s;ly in &s;uch a tent. In hot weather, both Kirgue&s;e and Kal|mucks remove the &s;ide-covering of the tent, in which &s;ituation it repre&s;ents an alcove. The Kirgue&s;e, with re&s;pect to their per&s;ons and dre&s;s, are much cleaner than the Kalmucks. As they are mo&s;tly people of property, they keep a great quantity of cattle, live well, in their way, and are well attired. Whatever is requi&s;ite for their cloathing and con&s;i&s;ts of manufac|tured &s;tuffs, they procure from Ru&s;&s;ian merchants, A&s;iatic caravans, or el&s;e by robbery, though, to do them ju&s;tice, they become daily more and more hone&s;t, and trade now, by way of barter. The articles they make for them&s;elves, are fur-dre&s;&s;es, leather, a kind of coar&s;e camblet, felt-covers of &s;heeps' wool, which they neatly mix with wool of various colours, all &s;orts of leather and &s;ome trifling things. They chiefly tan their hides as do the Kalmucks, with &s;our milk, and this leather, &s;o tanned, compo&s;es mo&s;t of their mens' dre&s;s. In &s;ummer-time, they wear different kinds of
<PB N="293" REF="302">
&s;mall, upper garments, made of hides, the hair of which is outwards, and &s;uch a coat they call <HI>jirgak.</HI> Some|thing more di&s;tingui&s;hing, yet frequently worn, is what they call <HI>daka,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;kins of unborn colts of different colours, &s;o &s;own together that on the middle of the back and both &s;houlders, the manes fall as an ornament in the &s;eams. Some, al&s;o, wear &s;um|mer-cloaths of well-tanned goat &s;kins, without the hair, the&s;e they call <HI>ka&s;kan</HI> and are much worn by the Jaikian Co&s;&s;acks, being &s;oft and impenetrable by the rain. Their method of preparing them is as fol|lows. Having cut off the hair from the &s;kin, they moi&s;ten it with water and lay it, rolled up, in &s;ome warm &s;pot, till it begins to be offen&s;ive and the hair loo&s;ens at the roots; they then &s;crape the &s;kin with a blunt knife and afterwards dry it to a certain degree. If the &s;kin be thin, they lay it in &s;weet milk; if thick, in &s;our or turned milk, tanning it therein for four days, but &s;craping it every day, in order to make it more &s;upple. It is then dried in the &s;hade and worked with the hands and feet till it becomes very &s;oft. After this it is &s;moked, dried again and finally dyed with a yel|low-brown colour, made from the roots of rhapontic, or the thrift <HI>(&s;tatice Tartarica),</HI> called, by the Kal|mucks, <HI>tu&s;chutt,</HI> and, by the Ru&s;&s;ians, <HI>&s;heltoi koren,</HI> that is, yellow-root, which are boiled in allum-water; &s;ome are &s;aid to mix a little &s;heep-fat among the boil|ing roots, in order to fix the colour fa&s;ter. When the dye is cold, it is &s;aid to be of the con&s;i&s;tency of a &s;oft
<PB N="294" REF="303">
pulp, which they &s;pread over each &s;ide of the &s;kin twice or more, letting them dry each time, and then work and render them &s;oft again. Such &s;kins may be wa&s;hed very often, and not lo&s;e their pretty, yellow-brown colour. They u&s;e the &s;ame root for dying wool, but for a red colour they u&s;e genuine cochineal, which grows in &s;ome part of the &s;tep, in &s;ome low-lands, about the Jaik, and is called by them <HI>ky&s;il-bujaf.</HI> They have, among them, &s;ome few &s;ilver-&s;miths and black-&s;miths, but they are &s;uch inexpert workmen, as to be able to make only &s;ome, rough, trifling things. They are at a lo&s;s to conceive to what perfection tho&s;e Europeans have arrived, who are able to manufacture needles and thimbles: all fine trifles of this denomi|nation, are bartered for by them at Orenberg and &s;ome other places on the frontiers. Having no coin among them, they e&s;timate every thing by the value of a hor&s;e or &s;heep, and their cu&s;tomary, &s;mall coin are wolves-&s;kins and lamb-&s;kins.</P>
<P>The man's dre&s;s, be&s;ides the upper-garment, con|&s;i&s;ts in a cotton under-one, and a &s;hirt of blue linen or <HI>kitaika,</HI> which is open, like a bed-gown, from top to bottom, but lapped over before, and, with other cotton cloaths, tied fa&s;t about the body. They gird their upper-garments with a leather belt, on which hangs, u&s;ually, a ve&s;&s;el with gun-powder and a bag full of &s;hot and balls, mo&s;t of the Kirgue&s;e of property carry|ing fire-arms with them. Some make their own pow|der,
<PB N="295" REF="304">
digging &s;alt-petre from the old tumuli, and it is &s;aid to be &s;o good, that they need only wa&s;h the ground from it and may then mix it with &s;ulphur and coals. The &s;ulphur, and indeed the chief of their gun-powder, they purcha&s;e from the A&s;iatic caravans.</P>
<P>The mens' &s;ummer-caps are commonly made of felt and covered with &s;tuff. They are worked with the needle with threads of various colours, and lined with velvet. The top is conical, and the cap has two broad flaps that hang down on the cheeks, or turn back or up occa&s;ionally. Their winter-caps are lined with fur. Be&s;ides the&s;e, they wear, as do the Tartars, upon their &s;horn heads, for they &s;have their heads clean, leaving whi&s;kers on the upper-lip and a pointed beard on the chin or at the corners of their mouths, a kind of black cap worked with various coloured needle-work. The boots which the rich wear, are made by the Bu|charians, and &s;old very dear. They are made of a&s;s's &s;kin, very clum&s;y, and after a peculiar model; the &s;oles are full of large points, are encompa&s;&s;ed with iron, and are generally &s;o badly made, that no Euro|pean would be able to walk in them, without falling down at every &s;tep. The Kirgue&s;e, however, &s;eldom walk, but are almo&s;t always on hor&s;eback; &s;o that mo&s;t of them are bandy-legged and very bad walkers. They are of middling &s;tature, rather hand&s;ome fea|tured when young, but among the old, their faces are jewi&s;h and frightful, and, owing to their indolence,
<PB N="296" REF="305">
their bodies are thick.
'Being well clad,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>
<Q>in furs and two or three garments at a time, they are &s;eldom hurt by the frequent falls they get from their hor&s;es.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The trappings of their fine hor&s;es employ their thoughts almo&s;t as much as that of their per&s;ons; having always elegant &s;addles, hand&s;ome hou&s;ings and ornamented bridles. They are generally armed when on hor&s;eback, and carry a &s;hort, twi&s;ted whip, about an inch thick, like that of an Engli&s;h po&s;tili|on. When they go a hunting, they wear <HI>&s;chalvars,</HI> or long trow&s;ers, which reach up to the arm-pits, into which they cram all their cloaths; and a Kir|gue&s;e, in this dre&s;s, may be taken, at a di&s;tance, for a mon&s;trous pair of breeches on hor&s;eback.</Q></P>
<P>The common dre&s;s of the women, is a blue &s;hift, not open before, which is the only covering they wear at home, a pair of long breeches, bands, with which they wrap up their feet and legs, flat-bottomed &s;ocks, and a white or parti-coloured piece of linen, with which they veil their heads. The following is their u&s;ual head-dre&s;s, which they call <HI>d&s;haulok.</HI> They fir&s;t lay a kind of &s;tuff, three or four ells in length, over the head, bringing the ends of it down the &s;ides of the face, about which they braid their hair in two tre&s;&s;es. The ends of this &s;tuff they cro&s;s under the chin and carry them up over the head again, &s;o that the ends
<PB N="297" REF="306">
hang down on the ears on each &s;ide. This put on, they wind a &s;lip of &s;ome &s;tuff, four or five ells long and about two hands broad in the middle, round the head, &s;o as to form a kind of cylindrical turban. When they are better dre&s;&s;ed, this d&s;haulok is of finer &s;tuff, and &s;triped; over the blue &s;hift, they wear another of &s;ilk or &s;ome rich, Bucharian &s;tuff, ornamented with artificial flowers; they next put on a tippet of the &s;ame colour as the d&s;haulok, about the &s;houlders, and, over the whole, a wide Bucharian bed-gown, or chalat. They carefully cover their bo&s;om with a thick hand|kerchief, worked with the needle in various colours, within their under-&s;hift. They have, al&s;o, another ornamental dre&s;s, called <HI>d&s;chad&s;hbau,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of a full and long train, or tail, fa&s;tened to the hind part of the head, under the d&s;haulok. Above this flows to half way the leg a double tail, the &s;ize of a man's thumb, covered with velvet and ornamented at the end with a thick fringe of black &s;ilk. Married wo|men divide this tail, bringing it over the &s;houlders on each &s;ide, but girls &s;uffer it to hang down the back. Round this tail hangs, down to the knee, a kind of &s;tring, with all &s;orts of varicoloured fringes, corals,, beads and other things which make a jingling noi&s;e. They al&s;o wear a cap under the d&s;haulok, which, round the face, is ornamented and hung full with little, &s;ilver coins or medals. 'Sultanas or prince&s;&s;es,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>

The&s;e, al&s;o, wear &s;ilk cloaths, or rich &s;tuffs, or fine cloth &s;et off with gold lace and loops, or faced with fur; and even velvets are very common with this cla&s;s of ladies.</Q></P>
<P>The Kirgue&s;e are Mahomedans, which religion, they &s;ay, they brought with them from Turke&s;tan; they, therefore, take as many wives as they can rob or pay for; 'and many,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>
<Q>keep concubines, who are treated, in every re&s;pect, like wives, their children al&s;o, being reputed legitimate. The mo|derate price for a marriageable girl, to be taken as a fir&s;t wife, is about fifty hor&s;es, twenty or twenty-five cows, a hundred &s;heep, a few camels, or el&s;e a &s;lave, with a cuira&s;s, or coat of mail. The poorer &s;ort find wives at a cheaper rate, and the rich pay much dearer. The &s;econd wife of a married man co&s;ts much more than the fir&s;t, the third and follow|ing &s;till more. Common people, of cour&s;e, are obliged to be contented with one wife, and think them&s;elves very well off, if they can get that one, as they are often under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tealing her from &s;ome of the neighbouring nations. The Kalmuck women are the mo&s;t &s;ought after by the Kirgue&s;e, conceiving that nature has endowed them with &s;in|gular advantages for plea&s;ure, and that they pre&s;erve the marks of youth longer than the women of other

nations; in&s;omuch that the rich, are very willing to marry them, if they can be prevailed on to embrace Mahomedani&s;m; on the contrary, they hold the Per&s;ian women in &s;o little e&s;timation, that they give &s;uch as they take in marriage to their &s;laves. The e&s;pou&s;als con&s;i&s;t in a public declaration of the agree|ment made between the contracting parties and then a prie&s;t repeats a prayer. The evening before a wo|man is &s;ent for to &s;have off all her hair but that of her head, and on the day of marriage &s;he is carried in a carpet to the bridegroom's tent, and the wedding celebrated in a hut built on purpo&s;e by the bride's father. Previous to con&s;ummation al&s;o, the girl is carried about on a carpet to her companions, to take leave of them, in which ceremony, &s;he is attended by &s;everal others &s;inging all the way. If, unfortu|nately, it is di&s;covered that &s;he was not a maid when married, the gue&s;ts, the day after, kill the bridegroom's &s;addle-hor&s;e, tear his wedding-gar|ment in pieces and ill-treat the bride. In this ca&s;e, the father-in-law is obliged to give &s;atisfaction to the offended hu&s;band; but, on the contrary, if all is right, the rejoicings continue for &s;everal days, no|thing is thought of but eating and drinking, danc|ing, &s;inging, chatting, wre&s;tling, hor&s;e-racing and &s;hooting at a mark. At the two la&s;t-mentioned di|ver&s;ions, con&s;iderable bets are made, and the new-married couple give prizes to the conquerors, of &s;hewy apparel, trinkets and &s;ometimes hor&s;es. On
<PB N="300" REF="309">
breaking up the fe&s;tivities, the gue&s;ts make pre&s;ents of cattle and other things to the married pair.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Such as have more than one wife, give each a &s;e|parate <HI>jourt,</HI> or tent, where &s;he brings up her chil|dren after her own liking. The more children they have, the happier they e&s;teem them&s;elves, and are the more honoured by their hu&s;bands; whil&s;t &s;uch as prove barren, are &s;o little thought of, that the hu&s;band often makes them the &s;ervants of tho&s;e who encrea&s;e his family. The rich and great give pom|pous names to their children; &s;uch as <HI>Nour Hali,</HI> or the great light; <HI>Ir Hali,</HI> or <HI>Erali,</HI> the exalted man; <HI>Do&s;t Hali,</HI> the powerful friend; <HI>Batyr</HI> or <HI>Bagatyr,</HI> the hero; <HI>Temir Ir,</HI> the man of iron; <HI>Beg-Hali,</HI> the pow|erful prince, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>According to Mahomedan cu&s;tom, it is difficult to &s;ee their women; the richer Kirgue&s;e have a &s;eparate tent for their wives and one for them&s;elves. They are zealous enough in their faith, yet very ignorant, hav|ing but few Mahomedan prie&s;ts among them. Their horde, however, has now an achan or chief prie&s;t, who generally goes about with the khan.</P>
<P>In their way of living, they ob&s;erve &s;trictly the law of Mahomet, of cour&s;e, they eat no impure cattle. Of wild animals they eat only the antilope, the &s;tep-hor&s;e and the different kinds of deer. This meat com|po&s;es
<PB N="301" REF="310">
their chief food, though they, now, accu&s;tom them&s;elves to food made of flour and groats, which they procure from the Ru&s;&s;ians by bartar. In eating &s;uch things, they mix them with &s;our milk or the &s;pi|rituous extraction from mares milk, called <HI>kumy&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tooke,</HI> who frequently &s;peaks from the authority of <HI>Gmelin,</HI> who travelled into Siberia &s;ome years before Dr. <HI>Pallas,</HI> and as &s;uch, I &s;hall often quote him, &s;ays,
<Q>that mutton is their ordinary winter-food, and they will live on it for many months together. At times, they will eat other food, but it is only at occa&s;ional fe&s;tivals and for the &s;ake of variety. In winter, they drink broth, to quench their thir&s;t, and from the quantity of boiled meat they u&s;e, have plenty of this liquor; they are fond of fat, regaling them|&s;elves often on &s;uet or butter, which they eat without bread or any dre&s;&s;ing. They are, in general, extra|vagant eaters, or, more properly, <HI>devourers;</HI> four men, returned from hunting, often con&s;uming, at one meal, a whole &s;heep and leaveing nothing but the bones.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They &s;moke tobacco to exce&s;s, as do all the Tar|tars. Men, women and children, all &s;moke and take &s;nuff, which latter, they keep in little horns, fa&s;ten|ed to their girdle. Excepting kumy&s;s and arrack, they have no inebriating liquor; for this rea&s;on, they &s;moke till they grow giddy, &s;wallowing the &s;moke,
<PB N="302" REF="311">
that they may attain that end the &s;ooner. They u&s;e Chine&s;e pipes when they can get them, but at other times, and for common u&s;e, have a contrivance of their own; they take the <HI>tibia</HI> or leg-bone of a &s;heep, and cutting off the knob at one end, take out the marrow, and make a hole in the &s;ide at the other end, near the knob, like to that which the lips are are applied to in a german-flute. When they would &s;moke, they introduce a wad of wool into the tube and thru&s;t it up to the above-mentioned hole; the de&s;ign of this is, to prevent the tobacco, with which the tube is filled, from choaking up the hole, which is the mouth-piece to this extraordinary pipe. At the end, where the knob was cut off, they light the tobacco with touchwood, drawing the &s;moke into their mouths, by the little lateral hole through the wool, and they &s;uck with &s;o much force, that a great quantity of &s;moke comes out at their no&s;trils: the re&s;t they &s;wallow. Each per&s;on takes three or four whiffs of this kind, and then pa&s;&s;es the pipe to his next neighbour, who does the &s;ame and &s;ends it round; but they have an invention &s;till more ingenious for a &s;moking party. Having found a place convenient for lying down upon the ground, one of the compa|ny makes water in the centre of this &s;pot, to &s;ettle the earth and make it &s;oft and fit to receive a hole, which they make with the handle of a whip; in this hole they put the tobacco, lighting it with touch|wood, and lying all round it flat on their bellies;

<PB N="303" REF="313">
every &s;moker then thru&s;ts, obliquely, a hollow cab|bage-&s;talk into the moi&s;tened earth, in &s;uch a man|ner, that the extremity may touch the tobacco at the bottom of the hole, and in this attitude they &s;moke at their ea&s;e, without any inconvenience to each other. By this means, all their heads are in a cloud of tobacco-&s;moke, which; to them, is a great luxury and intoxicates them all in a &s;hort time.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The habitations of the Kirgue&s;e are portable tents, made of felt, like tho&s;e of the Kalmucks, only larger and more neat; the fire is made in the centre, directly under the opening left in the roof. Round the fire, they &s;pread pieces of felt, Per&s;ian carpets, or fur-cu&s;hions. The wealthy, have the in&s;ide of their tents hung with different coloured &s;tuffs, and not un|frequently with &s;ilk. The leather bottles and the &s;everal che&s;ts and boxes, are ranged round the &s;ide of the tent, and their arms, &s;addles, bridles, bed-cloaths, &amp;c. hung up over them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As the <HI>Aimaks,</HI> or principal families of this nation, love to keep together, their camps contain a great number of huts or tents and con&s;equently take up a large &s;pace of ground. The re&s;idence of the khan is &s;urrounded by near a thou&s;and tents; but, on the other hand, one may travel fifty or &s;ixty miles, with|out &s;eeing a &s;ingle habitation. They are commonly changing their &s;ituation, both in &s;ummer and winter,
<PB N="304" REF="314">
for the &s;ake of pa&s;turage; but, the aimaks fir&s;t agree with one another not to &s;ettle too near together. Their tents are very cold in winter, as their fire con|&s;i&s;ts of nothing but the dung of cattle, dried.</Q></P>
<P>The rarer prie&s;ts are among the Kirgue&s;e, the more numerous are the &s;orcerers. They have, as I learnt, five different &s;orts, one &s;ort prophe&s;ies from books and from the &s;tars, which they do in a &s;cientific way, with|out any private &s;hew of pecuniary motives; the&s;e are called <HI>Fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;cha.</HI> There is, al&s;o, a &s;ort of fortune-tel|lers among them, called <HI>Jaurunt&s;chi,</HI> who, from the &s;houlder-blade of a &s;heep, foretell future events and an&s;wer all que&s;tions. They &s;ay, this &s;houlder-blade &s;hould be cleared from the &s;kin and fle&s;h, not with the teeth, but with the mouth, otherwi&s;e it is unfit for the black-art. When a que&s;tion is put to one of the&s;e for|tune-tellers, he directs his mind to &s;ome thought and lays the blade-bone on the fire, till the flat-&s;ide gets &s;everal rents and chops with the heat, and foretells from the marks and lines &s;o left. They are &s;aid to be able to tell at what di&s;tance an ab&s;ent per&s;on is. They tell you, that a party of Kalmucks, who had once &s;uch a fortune-teller among them, committed a con&s;iderable robbery on the Kirgue&s;e, and that a party of the latter, who had al&s;o a fortune-teller among them too, was exhorted by him to pur&s;ue the enemy; but the Kal|muck fortune-teller was &s;o experienced in his art, that he gave &s;ea&s;onable notice to his countrymen of the
<PB N="305" REF="315">
approach of the Kirgue&s;e, and urged them to fly. When the Kirgui&s;ian fortune-teller thus found he could not compa&s;s his de&s;ign, he is &s;aid to have made u&s;e of the following &s;tratagem. He ordered his party to &s;ad|dle their hor&s;es, with the front of the &s;addle backwards, and &s;et on them in this manner with their backs to the hor&s;es heads; by this means, the Kalmucks were lead into an error, for their fortune-teller advi&s;ed them to go on &s;teadily and gently, as there was no danger, the Kirgue&s;e having their backs turned towards them. Thus were they overtaken by the Kirgue&s;e and made pri&s;oners. I heard this tale from a Kirgue&s;e him&s;elf, but am not accountable for it's credibility.</P>
<P>A third kind of &s;orcerers is called <HI>Bak&s;cha,</HI> and great confidence is placed in them. When their advice is a&s;ked, they demand a &s;elected hor&s;e, &s;heep or buck, as a &s;acrificial victim. The bak&s;cha then begins his magic hymns and to beat (as do the Laplanders) a kind of magic drum <HI>(kobig)</HI> hung with gingling rings, jumping and making many violent motions with his body, for half an hour. He then orders the victim to be brought forth and &s;lain, catches the blood in a par|ticular ve&s;&s;el, takes the &s;kin for him&s;elf, and, the fle&s;h being eaten by tho&s;e who are pre&s;ent, gathers the bones, paints them red and blue, and throws them from him towards the we&s;t, where he al&s;o pours the blood of the animal. After this, he jumps about again, for &s;ome time longer, and then gives the de&s;ired an&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="316">Another kind of magicians, <HI>Ramt&s;cha,</HI> are tho&s;e who pour fat or butter in the fire and prophe&s;y by the co|lour of the flame. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, they al&s;o im|molate a victim and make u&s;e of conjurations: but this &s;ort of witchcraft is in very little repute. There are, likewi&s;e, wizzards and witches <HI>(D&s;haadugar)</HI> who enchant the &s;laves and pri&s;oners, &s;o that they common|ly lo&s;e their way, upon their flight, and fall into the hands of their proprietors again; or, if they &s;hould e&s;cape, fall, &s;oon after, into Kirgui&s;ian &s;lavery. The&s;e pull out &s;ome of the hair from the captiv's head, a&s;k his name and &s;et him in the middle of a tent over the out-&s;pread cinders of the hearth, which are &s;trewed with &s;alt. This done, the witch begins her &s;pell, du|ring which, the pri&s;oner is thrice to go backwards; the witch then &s;pits on each of his foot-&s;teps and, every time, runs out at the door; at la&s;t, &s;he &s;trews a little of the a&s;hes, on which the pri&s;oner &s;tands, upon his tongue, and thus ends the enchantment. The Jaiki|an Co&s;&s;acks firmly believe, that, if a pri&s;oner tells his true name, the witchcraft takes an infallible effect.</P>
<P>The numerous Kirgue&s;e live far more uncon&s;trained than the Kalmucks, who acknowledge &s;o many little de&s;pots among them. Every Kirgue&s;e lives like a free lord, and, on this account, they are le&s;s dangerous as foes; yet, every aimak, or family, has it's chief, to whom all the relations and dependants pay a voluntary obedi|ence. Tho&s;e who have mo&s;t &s;ubjects and dependants,
<PB N="307" REF="317">
take the title of Khans and Sultans. They have, al&s;o, other degrees of rank. Certain nobles they call <HI>Bu,</HI> &s;ome other honourable per&s;ons of ancient extraction, <HI>Chod&s;ha,</HI> and &s;ome others, <HI>Mur&s;es.</HI> The khan, elected and placed over a &s;mall Kirgui&s;ian horde, has but little power, unle&s;s he can acquire it by his wealth and li|berality. It is not he that can decide di&s;putes and contentions among his people, the&s;e are determined by a certain, annual a&s;&s;embly of the elders and chiefs of families. If they divide into parties or are threat|ned by &s;ome war, they call together a democratic council and elect one of the elders or chiefs, for their general. 'The great and wealthy,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>
<Q>live perfectly in the &s;ame manner as the re&s;t of the people and are remarkable only for the numerous train, that accompanies them in their cavalcades, and the quan|tity of huts which &s;urround their quarters, inhabited by their wives, their children or their &s;laves. The great men treat the common people as brethren, and as all the Kirgue&s;e are equally free, the&s;e latter &s;hew no great marks of re&s;pect to them; &s;ince every one, immediately on becoming rich, is as great as the be&s;t of them. In all the tents, the common people place them&s;elves by the &s;ide of the nobles, without the lea&s;t ceremony, eat with them, and &s;ay what they plea&s;e before them. When a &s;uperior bids them do any thing, they execute his orders, if they like tho&s;e orders. Although the commands of the Khan are not executed with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous exactne&s;s, they
<PB N="308" REF="318">
treat him with the profounde&s;t veneration, looking on his per&s;on as &s;acred. <HI>Nour Hali,</HI> the reigning khan of one of the hordes, is confirmed in his &s;o|vereignty by the court of Peter&s;burg; he is an equi|table, di&s;creet prince and &s;trictly devoted to Ru&s;&s;ia. His property con&s;i&s;ts in about a thou&s;and hor&s;es, four hundred cows, two hundred camels, four thou|&s;and &s;heep and &s;everal hundred goats, &s;o that in re|&s;pect to riches alone he holds a rank but little di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, and as he is obliged to form <HI>tabounes,</HI> or herds of cattle for a number of princes, to enable them to make &s;ome figure, and his numerous family and &s;laves, and the frequent vi&s;its he receives, occa&s;i|ons a great con&s;umption of cattle, and as he enjoys no revenue at all, it will be ever impo&s;ible for him to a ma&s;s a large fortune; notwith&s;tanding this, he makes a much greater figure than any one of his horde, and the pre&s;ents he obtains from the court of Ru&s;&s;ia contribute greatly to the &s;upport of his dig|nity. His re&s;idence is compo&s;ed of a va&s;t number of huts; tho&s;e of &s;tate are very richly adorned. His family, as well as him&s;elf, are always dre&s;&s;ed in cloth of gold or &s;ilver, or velvets, and his per&s;on is con|&s;tantly &s;urrounded by the elders of the nation. The title of the khan is <HI>Tagh&s;ir Ghanim,</HI> or <HI>Tagh&s;ir Pad|&s;cha&iuml;m;</HI> his wives are called &s;imply <HI>Ghanim;</HI> the princes, his &s;ons, bear the title of <HI>Tagh&s;ir Saltan,</HI> and the prince&s;&s;es that of <HI>Ghanim Ka&iuml;,</HI> daughters of the khan. The pre&s;ent khan has four wives and eight
<PB N="309" REF="319">
concubines; the former are &s;prung from rich and ancient families of the Kirgue&s;e, but the concubines are either taken from the common people or &s;laves, bought from the Kalmucks, on account of their beauty. <HI>Beg Hali,</HI> one of his &s;ons, is khan of the A&iuml;raklian Troughmenians, and Saltan <HI>Pri Hali,</HI> an|other of them, is chief of the other Troughmenians; excepting the two younge&s;t, all the princes are mar|ried to daughters of the principal Kirgue&s;e, being already in the rank of elders, in the different ulu&s;&s;es of both hordes, a ulu&s;s being a &s;ociety of &s;everal fa|milies, who keep carefully together for the &s;ake of pre&s;erving their de&s;cent pure and unmixed. The&s;e alliances and the dignities of his &s;ons, contribute much to the power of <HI>Nour Hali.</HI> As the prince&s;&s;es, by the laws of the koran are forbidden to marry any relation, they are all yet &s;ingle, and &s;ome of them begin to grow old, yet the khan, through pride, will not di&s;po&s;e of them, at even a hand&s;ome price to any &s;uitor that is not de&s;cended of illu&s;trious blood. The people are not permitted to &s;ee the wives and daugh|ters of their khan; they never appear in public but when changing their re&s;idence, and then they go on hor&s;es and camels, in their riche&s;t dre&s;s and orna|ments. Whenever a Kirgue&s;e, on hor&s;eback, hap|pens to meet the khan in the &s;tep or de&s;art, he di&s;|mounts, and advancing in an oblique direction to|wards him, &s;ays aloud <HI>Alla arba&s;chou!</HI> i. e. God give thee pro&s;perity! After this &s;alutation, the khan
<PB N="310" REF="320">
&s;trikes him gently on the &s;houlder with his hand or whip, and this pa&s;&s;es for a &s;ort of benediction.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Though they are forbidden to &s;teal, or carry off men or cattle, they are &s;o far from thinking the&s;e depredations &s;hameful in any way, that they glory in them, boa&s;ting to one another of the exploit and the extraordinary adventures accompanying it, as if it were &s;ome couragious act of heroi&s;m, or &s;ome ho|nourable and glorious feat of chivalry. The cir|cumjacent nations are mo&s;t frequently expo&s;ed to their incur&s;ions, but the Kalmucks are their mo&s;t favourite objects, though the ri&s;k is the greate&s;t: as for the Ru&s;&s;ians, they are &s;eldom mole&s;ted.</Q></P>
<P>They commit their petty robberies in &s;mall gangs, and if, upon the Ru&s;&s;ian frontiers, they drive away a &s;tock of hor&s;es and &s;eize &s;ome &s;ingle men and women, it is commonly about the time when they quit that di&s;trict with their flocks; for as long as they feed their cattle in their vicinity, they take care that no di&s;orders are committed, lea&s;t the innocent and guiltle&s;s, who can|not get off as expeditiou&s;ly with their flocks, &s;hould &s;uffer for the mi&s;demeanours of the perpetrators. They commonly &s;uit their periods of robbing &s;o well, as ne|ver to be caught. It has been remarked, that their neighbourhood is mo&s;t dangerous in tho&s;e places where the &s;tep, on the Ru&s;&s;ian frontiers, is flat and open; not in their mountainous and woody &s;teps, where they
<PB N="311" REF="321">
conceal them&s;elves and lie in wait for opportunities. The A&s;iatic caravans who pa&s;s through the in&s;ecure &s;teps, inhabited by the&s;e plunderers, to the Ru&s;&s;ian trading towns, gain over the aimaks of the di&s;trict they pa&s;s through, to their favour, by pre&s;ents of goods; in which ca&s;e they appoint them an e&s;cort, for which they are paid from ten to twelve rubles, or about forty-eight &s;hillings Engli&s;h, per camel.</P>
<P>'Be&s;ides the captures,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>
<Q>which acci|dent throws in their way, they go out &s;ometimes &s;ingly in &s;earch of adventures, and at other times in &s;mall parties, having at their head, but too often, &s;ome great lord of their nation. When they have a mind to pillage any caravan, in their own territories or beyond them, &s;everal ulu&s;&s;es join together for that purpo&s;e, entering into negotiations and making con|ventions in form, that they may be more certain of the predatory project. In this &s;ort of &s;kirmi&s;h, it often happens, that a great number of the Kirgue&s;e are made pri&s;oners and carried away captive by the caravans, and if any are killed in the fight, not the &s;malle&s;t enquiry is ever made of what is become of them. In trifling &s;eizures, every one keeps what he gets, but con&s;iderable and important &s;poils are di|vided, according to previous contract, or as the exi|gencies of the ca&s;e may require. Each adventurer keeps the cattle that fall to his &s;hare and, generally, the women he has taken, as the buying off a woman
<PB N="312" REF="322">
does great honour to the ravi&s;her. They yield up the &s;laves and merchandize to the more wealthy, who give them cattle in exchange. It is no uncom|mon thing to &s;ell their &s;laves to a neighbouring nati|on, e&s;pecially if the&s;e &s;laves are Ru&s;&s;ians, for as they are known to be laborious and accu&s;tomed to agri|culture, they fetch a great price, and it is the inte|re&s;t of the Kirgue&s;e to get rid of them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, knowing what they are to expect, if any Ru&s;&s;ians are found among their captives</Q>.</P>
<P><Q>The court of Ru&s;&s;ia has taken various mea&s;ures to put a check to the&s;e terrible di&s;orders. A line of in|trenchments and redoubts has been built along their frontiers. Wherever the river does not prevent their excur&s;ions, they fix a number of &s;ticks, with both ends in the earth, bent in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e in &s;ome countries for catching thru&s;hes; the&s;e &s;ticks, or wands, are placed from one redoubt to another, &s;o that the patrole can &s;ee, at once, by &s;uch as are wanting or deranged, whether any Kir|gue&s;e, (who come always on hor&s;eback), have pa&s;&s;ed the frontiers, and, on &s;uch di&s;covery, mount and pur&s;ue them immediately. The Ru&s;&s;ian &s;hepherds are armed and always on hor&s;eback, to be on their guard and defend them&s;elves, when nece&s;&s;ary. If, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e precautions, a robbery is committed, or a caravan bound to Ru&s;&s;ia is pil|laged on the de&s;art of the Kirgue&s;e, the Ru&s;&s;ian
<PB N="313" REF="323">
commandants demand re&s;titution from the khan; and if neither he nor the lords of the nation, can bring the people to con&s;ent to it, a troop of Ba&s;chirians is di&s;patched immediately into the horde, and the fir&s;t Kirgui&s;ian ulu&s;s they come to, is obliged to conduct them to that which committed the robbery, or be an&s;werable for the damage. The Ba&s;chirians then take with them a certain number of Kirgue&s;e and cattle, and bring them to Orenberg, where they are detained, till a &s;tate of the lo&s;s can be a&s;certained. This being done, the overplus is &s;ent back again, as &s;oon as the Ru&s;&s;ian pri&s;oners, taken in the engage|ment, are re&s;tored. When any &s;ingle robbers are caught, or a &s;mall party together, they are fir&s;t puni&s;hed and then &s;hut up in <HI>O&s;trogs</HI> of the fortre&s;&s;es, where pri&s;oners condemned to public works are con|fined.</Q></P>
<P>Was it not for their depredations, the Kirgue&s;e, would not be &s;o formidable. So little &s;anguinary are they, that they would rather make a &s;lave of a man than put him to death. Whil&s;t their &s;laves are faithful, they never treat them cruelly.
<Q>As they are all pa&s;&s;i|onately fond,' continues <HI>Tooke,</HI> 'of uncontrouled liberty, and as every man can acquire a &s;tock &s;uffici|ent for his own &s;upport, not one of them can bear the idea of being a &s;ervant to any of his countrymen; they are all brethren and have the re&s;olution to pre|&s;erve their condition as &s;uch, which is the rea&s;on that
<PB N="314" REF="324">
the rich are obliged to have <HI>ya&s;owres,</HI> or &s;laves, from other nations. The more of the&s;e a Kirgui&s;ian lord po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, the greater figure he makes, and the more care is taken of his flocks. Even the courtiers and dome&s;tics of the great are all &s;laves; the khan keeps about fifty. Slavery, among this people, is no great hard&s;hip, to &s;uch as are once accu&s;tomed to their way of life; for the ma&s;ters treat their &s;laves as if they were their relations, &s;upplying them with all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and giving them the &s;ame provi|&s;ions they eat them&s;elves. A pri&s;oner, on the con|trary, who cannot bring him&s;elf to adopt their me|thod of living, fares but ill among them. Attempts made to e&s;cape, never fail to draw on the delinquents &s;uch cruel treatment, as often co&s;ts them their lives; involving in their calamity &s;uch unfortunate women, as, calculated by &s;entiments of humanity, have con|tributed to favour their de&s;ertion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As all of them are not in a condition to afford &s;o many &s;laves as are nece&s;&s;ary to look after their flocks, the rich give their &s;uperfluous &s;heep and cattle to the poor; who, in return, tend the herds and flocks of their benefactors. If the cattle of a Kirgue&s;e multi|ply rapidly, he con&s;iders it as a &s;ecret &s;ugge&s;tion to beneficence, and di&s;tributes them largely to his more indigent neighbours. So long as his benefactor re|mains in good circum&s;tances, the other is never ex|pected to make any return; but if his cattle &s;hould
<PB N="315" REF="325">
be &s;tolen, or dimini&s;hed by contagious di&s;tempers, the per&s;on whom his bounty &s;et up, in the time of his pro&s;perity, re&s;tores him what he received, and often adds to them &s;ome of the young produced by the animals whil&s;t he was the depo&s;itory of his neigh|bour's beneficence; even though, by &s;o doing, he &s;hould reduce him&s;elf to the &s;tate of indigence he was in before. This courteous and honourable manner of di&s;po&s;ing of their property, puts numbers of them above the fear of want; rendering, at the &s;ame time, their flocks and herds, as it were, immortal; for the more they give away in the time of affluence, the more abundantly they receive on a change of for|tune.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For the homage of the Kirgue&s;e to the crown of Ru&s;&s;ia, that court protects them again&s;t all invaders, and, in commerce and &s;ocial life, affords them the &s;ame advantages as to the Ru&s;&s;ians, gives them the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their country, di&s;turbing neither their con&s;titution, their laws, their religion nor the trade they carry on with their neighbours. They pay no kind of tax or tribute; in &s;hort, they are under no re&s;triction or con&s;traint whatever; but they are bound to be friendly to all Ru&s;&s;ians and all nations in alli|ance with the crown, and con&s;ider the enemies of Ru&s;&s;ia as their own. To guarantee their obligations, they &s;end certain principal people <HI>(Amanati)</HI> to Orenburg, as ho&s;tages, who receive an allowance,
<PB N="316" REF="326">
&s;tipulated by them&s;elves, of fifteen kopeeks, or &s;even-pence half-penny, Engli&s;h, per day, for every ho&s;tage, and five kopeeks for each dome&s;tic, living very well for this &s;mall &s;um. If the Khan goes to Orenburg, he mu&s;t fir&s;t a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion of the govern|or, and is then received like a &s;overeign prince, a body-guard is appointed him, and the phy&s;icians of Orenburg, are obliged to furni&s;h remedies, gratis, to &s;uch of their &s;ick as apply for them; but, notwith|&s;tanding all this, and in defiance of their homage and their treaties, they cannot but give way to their cha|racteri&s;tic pa&s;&s;ion for plunder and rapine; if any thing re&s;trains them, it is either the armed force, which Ru&s;&s;ia, at times, is obliged to employ again&s;t them, the per&s;onal intere&s;t and advantage they draw from commerce, or the influence of their chiefs, who have a ju&s;ter &s;en&s;e of decency and decorum.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We find no &s;chool among them, &s;o that a few only know how to write their language, which is &s;aid to be a dialect of the Tartarian, pretty pure. The Kirgue&s;e have a frank and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing air.</Q>
In their conduct towards &s;trangers, &s;ays <HI>Pallas,</HI> they are affable, yet always intere&s;ted and crafty; even when they vi&s;it any Ru&s;&s;ian trading town, they will make trifling pre&s;ents to people, in order to a&s;k them for more important ones.
<Q>They have a &s;harp but not a fierce look and &s;maller eyes than the Tartars; they do not want good, natural &s;en&s;e, are greedy of dan|ger
<PB N="317" REF="327">
and high-&s;pirited; but, at the &s;ame time, fond of their ea&s;e and voluptuous. Their women have the reputation of being good economi&s;ts, tender and compa&s;&s;ionate towards their &s;laves, who&s;e e&s;cape they &s;trive to favour, even by expo&s;ing them&s;elves to va|rious inconveniencies and the rude treatment of their hu&s;bands.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Armed as the Kirgue&s;e always are, they are but inexpert warriors; they are, however, good bow|men, their mu&s;kets have no locks, but are fired with a match; they cannot di&s;charge them on hor&s;e-back, but di&s;mount, lie on the ground and re&s;t the barrel of the gun on a fork fa&s;tened to it. It is ea&s;y to ima|gine that they, &s;ometimes, meet with an enemy that has not patience enough to wait for all the&s;e maneu|vres. The in&s;tant they perceive that nothing is to be done, or that they are beaten; in &s;pite of comman|ders or military law, every man takes the &s;horte&s;t way home; but, when they have to engage with an enemy as little practi&s;ed as them&s;elves in the art of war, they are almo&s;t always victorious.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Their laws are few, but founded on the koran and the u&s;ages of their ance&s;tors. Starchans or elders are &s;et over the ulu&s;&s;es, and the Khan's deci&s;ion is the la&s;t appeal. A murderer, for two years after the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime, is at the mercy of the rela|tions of the per&s;on &s;lain; who, if they can lay hold
<PB N="318" REF="328">
of him in that time, may put him to death; if he e&s;capes and is inclined to return home, he may pur|cha&s;e that permi&s;&s;ion, by paying 100 hor&s;es, a &s;lave and two camels, to the family of the decea&s;ed. In lieu of hor&s;es, he may give &s;heep, five &s;heep being equivalent to one hor&s;e. He that kills a woman, an infant, or a &s;lave, pays half the foregoing fine, as, al&s;o, any one that makes a woman mi&s;carry; but in all the&s;e ca&s;es the relations and friends of the culprit endeavour to make as good a bargain as they can with the injured party, who generally remit a part of the penalty. Maiming a man is reckoned as half-murder. For a thumb cut off, the criminal pays a hundred &s;heep, the little finger is valued at twenty. The lo&s;s of the ears is &s;uch an abomination, that a man without them, though he &s;hould have lo&s;t them in the mo&s;t innocent manner, is not even tolerated among them. Whoever commits a robbery on his countrymen, re&s;tores nine times the value. None are allowed to take an oath in their own cau&s;e, and if the accu&s;ed can get no brother or friend to &s;wear for him, he is proceeded again&s;t as guilty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Their manner of &s;alutation is like that of the Tar|tars, in &s;queezing each others right-hand between both hands, and &s;aying, <HI>Salom malikom,</HI> peace be with thee! to which the other replies, <HI>Malikom &s;alom,</HI> with thee be peace! They do not uncover their heads.</Q>
Old acquaintance, however, &s;ays <HI>Pallas,</HI> embrace each

other with great warmth and cordiality.
<Q>After the fir&s;t &s;alutations, they pre&s;ent their gue&s;ts, with the choice&s;t viands they have. To do the honours of their hou&s;e, when they have much company, they commonly kill a &s;heep, for making <HI>bi&s;chbarmak,</HI> or the five-finger di&s;h, which is a &s;ort of ha&s;h, made of fat meat chopped and &s;tewed, and is eaten with the fingers. This &s;tew, they pre&s;ent to their friends by cramming handfulls of it into their mouths, and the per&s;on who&s;e mouth they &s;o fill, eats it as greedily, as if he wi&s;hed to devour the hand that crams him. When the mouthful, thus given, is too large, the eater empties half of it into his hands, till he has gorged the other half, and, after this, &s;wallows the re&s;t. This honour is done to all the great men of the nation, when they eat in &s;tate, and the &s;ame po|litene&s;s is &s;hewn, by them, to their inferiors, as often as they treat them; even the Khan him&s;elf conde|&s;cends &s;o far as to &s;tuff bi&s;chmark into the mouth of &s;uch as are admitted to the honour of dining with him. If a &s;tranger has for his friend any great man of the nation, or any private per&s;on known to be rich, he may traver&s;e all the hordes, in full &s;ecurity, with him, and may tru&s;t to his protection better than to a military e&s;cort. Numbers of Ru&s;&s;ians a|vail them&s;elves of this di&s;po&s;ition of the Kirgue&s;e and carry on very lucrative branches of traffic, under the protection of &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed man.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="331">The property or wealth of the Kirgue&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in breeding of cattle, of which hor&s;es and &s;heep are the mo&s;t numerous; they have a much &s;maller number of camels and very badly are they &s;tocked with great cat|tle, as they cannot live on the &s;teps in winter-time, without being fed. They make u&s;e of cows to tran&s;|port their tents, &amp;c. from one place to another. They have no other camels but tho&s;e of two bunches. As much as I could learn of the breeding of the&s;e animals I did; they bring the male to the female in winter-time, when &s;he is mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to receive him. The male being brought, &s;he falls down on her knees, and the male dropping upon his hind-legs and rai&s;ing his fore-legs quite upright, is above an hour engaged. Like other animals, when with young, the female camel &s;huns the male, and, if pur&s;ued, &s;ets up a roar. They carry their young a whole year, and fuckle them for two years; on this account the propagation of ca|mels is exceedingly &s;low. Wealthy Kirgue&s;e keep camels for milk, which is rich, blui&s;h, thick and very plea&s;ant in ta&s;te. It is con&s;idered as &s;alubrious, never yields any cream and, if &s;our, is &s;aid to ferment better and make a better &s;pirit, than mare's milk. In winter, camels require more attendance and care than any other cattle. They cloath them with felt and ru&s;h|mats, and, if the cold is &s;evere, &s;tretch felts and mats between the tents, to &s;helter them from the weather.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="332">Kirgui&s;ian hor&s;es are but little different from tho&s;e of the Kalmucks, except that they are higher. In wild|ne&s;s and &s;wiftne&s;s, they are equal to the former and are accu&s;tomed to &s;crape out their food, in winter, from underneath the &s;now. They divide their hor&s;es into certain &s;tocks; each &s;tock has one &s;tallion; and, &s;uch male-colts as are not kept for this purpo&s;e, are made geldings. This &s;tallion is as a &s;hepherd to the &s;tock or brood of mares, and keeps them together.</P>
<P>Their &s;heep are, without exception, the large&s;t and mo&s;t mon&s;trous of all wool-cattle, they are higher than a new-born calf and &s;o &s;trong and heavy, that &s;uch as are full-grown, in a proper &s;ea&s;on, will weigh between four and five puds, that is, about 180 lb. Engli&s;h. In their form, they re&s;emble Indian &s;heep, have crooked ram-heads, pouching under-lips, large, hang|ing ears, and often &s;ingle or double warts about their necks. In&s;tead of a tall, they have, on the rump, a great lump of &s;at, which will weigh from thirty to for|ty pounds, and yield from twenty to thirty pounds of tallow. Their wool is coar&s;e, long and mixed with hair behind. Their colour chiefly brown, or &s;potted with brown, and &s;ome are white. The rams are all horned, &s;o are the wether; &s;ome have from four to &s;ix horns, like tho&s;e of Iceland. The rams are left with the &s;tock during the whole &s;ummer, but, from the month of April to October, they bind a felt round their body, to prevent their coupling. During winter,
<PB N="322" REF="333">
they &s;eek their food underneath the &s;now, and eat the &s;now in&s;tead of drinking. The ewes generally bring forth two lambs at a time, and as there is no di&s;ea&s;e among them, they are left to the care of nature.
<Q>The fle&s;h is &s;weeter,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI> 'than that of the com|mon, European &s;heep, and men of di&s;tingui&s;hing pa|lates, perceive in it an aromatic flavour of different, odoriferous kinds of wormwood. The lambs are e&s;teemed &s;o delicate, that a certain number are &s;ent yearly from Orenburg to Peter&s;burg, for the court-kitchen. This &s;heep is the <HI>ovis laticauda</HI> of Lin|neus.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Lamb&s;kins, in this country, are in the highe&s;t e&s;ti|mation and make an important article in Kirgui&s;ian commerce; they are of various colours, white, black, blue, grey, &s;potted and fox-colour; the be&s;t are waved, &s;laine, as if varni&s;hed, and re&s;emble a piece of flowered dama&s;k. To increa&s;e the quantity of the&s;e &s;kins and, at the &s;ame time, to render them larger, the Kirgue&s;s few linen about the new-fallen lambs, which pre&s;erves the wool &s;leek and renders it waving. When the lamb is grown &s;o large as to bur&s;t the linen, they kill it for the &s;kin.</Q></P>
<P>They have, al&s;o, many goats among their &s;heep, whom they rear only for their milk. The&s;e animals, al&s;o, have an odd appearance, being mo&s;tly without horns, with long hair hanging neatly about the limbs:
<PB N="323" REF="334">
their ears hang down and their coats are &s;potted with various colours.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides a &s;hepherd-life, the Kirgue&s;e employ them|&s;elves much in hunting and have, thus, an opportuni|ty of extirpating both foxes and wolves, that are &s;uch enemies to their flocks. I have already mentioned, I think, that they train up eagles for this purpo&s;e. On the exten&s;ive &s;teps, they hunt on hor&s;eback. In order to catch antelopes, who, in winter, chiefly frequent reedy di&s;tricts, they &s;horten the reeds in particular places, which, as the animal leeps through, wounds him in the belly and renders him ea&s;ily to be caught.</P>
<P>This nation generally reaches an old age and are, till the la&s;t year of life, &s;prightly and without infirmi|ties. Their mo&s;t common complaints, are colds, fe|vers, &s;hortne&s;s of breath and the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, which they call <HI>kowrou&s;a&s;lan.</HI> I could not learn that they were ever afflicted, with tho&s;e burning fevers &s;o dangerous among the Kalmucks, but the <HI>t&s;chit&s;chak,</HI> or &s;mall-pox, has &s;hewn it&s;elf among them at times, yet without committing any great ravages. They are, however, &s;o afraid of this di&s;order, that as &s;oon as the eruption &s;hews it&s;elf, they for&s;ake the patient, putting down his food at a di&s;tance and leaving him to fetch it; and was a per&s;on, in this di&s;order, to go near any of their tents, they would think them&s;elves ju&s;tifiable in &s;hooting him.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="335">They bury their dead as do the Mahomedans. The grave is but &s;hallow, in which they lay the corp&s;e full-dre&s;&s;ed, cover it with branches and then with earth. At the head, which is always to the north, they put in a &s;tick which is kept perpendicular till the tumulus is rai&s;ed, beaten &s;olid and completed; this &s;tick is then drawn out and an opening thus left into the grave. In &s;toney di&s;tricts, they lay a pile of &s;tones over it. Where is the wonder then that we &s;hould meet with &s;o many <HI>tumuli</HI> in all the &s;teps, which mu&s;t continually increa&s;e, e&s;pecially as they like to bury their friends in &s;uch places where &s;ome holy men are &s;aid to have been buried before, near &s;ome met&s;ched, or hou&s;e of prayer, and generally where there are many old graves.</P>
<P>'When a man dies,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>
<Q>they cut his be&s;t garment to pieces and di&s;tribute the fragments among his friends, who lay them up as memorials of him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Circumci&s;ion, they never omit.
