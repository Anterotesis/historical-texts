<P>Among others, I &s;aw, adds this author, a counterfeit lieutenant of the police, who was &s;uffered to exerci&s;e a pretty &s;evere di&s;tibutive ju&s;tice. Another company, who per&s;onated the aga or general of the Jani&s;&s;aries, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hou&s;e, whil&s;t he went his rounds, and his &s;ervants treated the ma&s;k with as much re&s;pect as if it had been their ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Many per&s;ons in office have comedies acted before their hou&s;es the whole time; the &s;ubjects of the&s;e are various, but always very indecent, and the more they are &s;o, the greater &s;atisfaction they &s;eem to give. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee without a&s;toni&s;hment the hall of the divan, that terrible and dreadful tribunal, decked out for &s;ome days in the mo&s;t ridiculous manner.</P>
<P>Turning lanterns, on which are painted extravagant and often ob&s;cene figures, mixed with tran&s;parent writings, con&s;i&s;ting of the name of God, his attributes, the cypher of the Grand Signor, or &s;ome play on words; and pieces of looking-gla&s;s intended to increa&s;e the &s;plendour of the&s;e illuminations, amu&s;e the multi|tude at a &s;mall expence. Per&s;ons whom we might expect to be the mo&s;t grave, from their age and the importance of their employments, are not the lea&s;t plea&s;ed with the&s;e trivial and puerile imitations. A little palace made by a European with bits of gla&s;s and glue, the vizir had given a thou&s;and crowns for to make a figure on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">The plea&s;ure of knocking down Chri&s;tians is &s;o great a treat to the Turks, that the favourites of Sultan <HI>Mahomet</HI> could imagine nothing better to amu&s;e their ma&s;ter, in an entertainment which they gave on this occa&s;ion, within the &s;eraglio. And they thought &s;o little of it, as to reque&s;t the foreign amba&s;&s;adors to lend them their European dre&s;&s;es, in order to put them on the Jews, to make them re&s;emble Chri&s;tians. The Jews, ever de&s;tined to be beaten, and ever ready to &s;uffer, if it could be made worth their while, &s;ubmitted to all they plea&s;ed to inflict. Once, the court of the &s;eraglio agreed that the Jews never earned their money better than on that day. The amba&s;&s;adors were the greater fools of the two, in &s;uffering them&s;elves to be thus ridiculed.</P>
<P>It is at the&s;e times, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> that the Turki&s;h ladies endeavour to accompli&s;h their amorous de&s;igns; being permitted to go abroad veiled during the fe&s;tival of the Bayram, and on all public rejoicings. When the&s;e opportunities occur, they take with them a &s;mall bundle, carefully concealed, containing a change of dre&s;s. Their own is always of gay colours, with yel|low drawers, and a kind of half-boots of the &s;ame colour, fitted clo&s;e to the legs. The robes of the Chri&s;tian women are of di&s;mal, dark colours, and not made &s;o loo&s;e and flowing as the Turki&s;h: in &s;hort the difference is as great as can well be imagined. Having di&s;gui&s;ed them&s;elves in this dre&s;s, they cro&s;s the water
<PB N="6" REF="6">
to Pera; and if they have any appointment, which is generally the ca&s;e, and made by the intermi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome Jew, at who&s;e hou&s;e they have changed their dre&s;s, they go directly to the tavern, where their lover is to meet them. If not, they walk up and down the beautiful e&s;planade of Pera, which is generally crouded with the mo&s;t brilliant company of Con&s;tantinople. When they &s;ee any young Chri&s;tian, who attracts their attention, they let him know it, by &s;ome &s;ignificant glances; and if the&s;e are not &s;ufficient to allure him, beckon him a&s;ide, and make him an offer of their per&s;on, accompanied by &s;ome valuable pre&s;ent; which gives him to under&s;tand they are women of rank, perhaps of the highe&s;t. A brilliant or an emerald of five hundred pounds value is a trifle at &s;uch a time.</P>
<P>A Turki&s;h lady of quality walking one day in the manner we have de&s;cribed, took a fancy to a French youth of about &s;ixteen. Being in a Greek dre&s;s, &s;he made no &s;cruple of acco&s;ting him, pre&s;enting a diamond to him, and reque&s;ting to &s;peak with him alone. The Frenchman was at no lo&s;s to conceive her meaning, and being no &s;tranger to the hou&s;es of plea&s;ure at Pera, retired with her to one of the be&s;t. The fir&s;t meeting gave &s;o much &s;atisfaction, that a &s;econd was agreed on. The day appointed, they were both punctual, and after repeated proofs of their reciprocal affection, the lady propo&s;ed a &s;cheme for taking her gallant home. She was the wife of a very rich and noble Turk, who
<PB N="7" REF="7">
had no other, and only kept four female &s;laves in his haram; he was very old. but doated on his faithful wife. The youth having accepted her offer, prepared him&s;elf for the adventure. She then &s;ent for a Jew, a dealer in &s;laves, to whom &s;he offered a pre&s;ent of a 1000 ducats, if he would render her a very particular &s;ervice, which required fidelity and &s;ecrecy. The Jew who would have &s;old <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> for &s;uch a &s;um, readily con&s;ented. "Go then (&s;ays &s;he) to a certain tavern at Pera, where you will find a hand&s;ome French lad; he will expect you, and dre&s;s him in the habit of a female &s;lave: this done, bring him here, and offer to &s;ell him to my hu&s;band, but do not a&s;k more than 250 pia&s;tres, leaving your future recom|pence to me." The Jew, highly plea&s;ed with his good fortune, purcha&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ary cloaths, and went immediately to Pera, where the youth impatiently ex|pected him. The di&s;gui&s;e being completed, he was conducted to the Turk's hou&s;e, and pre&s;ented to him as a &s;lave to be &s;old. The hu&s;band thought the pre|tended &s;lave very pretty, but would not purcha&s;e her, le&s;t it &s;hould make his wife jealous. By accident the lady made her appearance, and enquiring what the girl was brought for, in&s;i&s;ted he &s;hould, as a proof of his affection, in being able to &s;ee &s;o pretty a girl every day without any improper thoughts. "Buy her (&s;aid &s;he) and give her to me, I will keep her con&s;tantly about my per&s;on, and take care &s;he does not rob me of your heart." The Turk, who never denied his dear wife
<PB N="8" REF="8">
any favour he could grant her, paid the price agreed on, and this &s;lave to love, was then placed in the para|di&s;e of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The Turk grew delighted with the beauty and addre&s;s of his late purcha&s;e, and imputed his wife's increa&s;ed fondne&s;s for him, to the a&s;&s;iduities of the &s;lave, who always kept her lively and in good humour. In fine, the &s;imple Turk grew more ena|moured with his wife than ordinary, became as he thought a father, and finding his wife grow big at the end of eight months, made a public declaration of it to the &s;urprize of every one.</P>
<P>The &s;ole interruption to the happine&s;s of the &s;lave and her mi&s;tre&s;s, aro&s;e from the importunities and me|naces of the Jew. He paid his vi&s;its regularly once a week, in order to extort money from the lady, through a fear of detection. His enquiries as to the health of the family, were generally accompanied with &s;ome di&s;a&s;trous tale of his lo&s;&s;es in trade; in &s;hort, he made about 14,000 pia&s;tres by this intrigue. At length, another circum&s;tance threatened a di&s;covery, and obliged a final &s;eparation. This was, that our &s;lave began to di&s;cover a beard, which could not be kept under; &s;having only increa&s;ing its growth. And after a thou&s;and prote&s;tations of love and gratitude, he was permitted to make his e&s;cape in the night, loaded with jewels and money.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">It is not a little &s;ingular, that the mo&s;t infamous of all the hou&s;es of gallantry at Pera, is near the hotel of our amba&s;&s;ador. And nothing is more common than for Turki&s;h ladies of rank to di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves and hire a room in this hou&s;e, &s;o &s;ituated as to &s;ee every per&s;on who enters it, and when they have pitched upon a man they like, according to a private agreement with the ma&s;ter, he is &s;hewn up to the di&s;|gui&s;ed lady as to one of his public girls. If he is a man of gallantry, he finds him&s;elf mo&s;t agreeably &s;ur|prized; for in&s;tead of being in the arms, perhaps of a di&s;ea&s;ed pro&s;titute, he finds him&s;elf in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a lovely whole&s;ome wanton; and in&s;tead of being called upon for money, he is, in fact, amply rewarded.</P>
<P>In the city, &s;uburbs, and along the banks of the canal of the Black &s;ea, there are no le&s;s than 12,000 of the&s;e hou&s;es; their number is ea&s;ily a&s;certained, the ma&s;ters of each paying a gold ducat per day for a licence to keep them open: this is a &s;ettled tax which never varies. It is well known they are kept by Greeks, but they are chiefly frequented and &s;up|ported by Turks of every rank and de&s;cription. The mo&s;t e&s;teemed taverns are, tho&s;e of Galata and Pera, which are filled with the better &s;ort of Turks every Friday. There being no divans held on that day for the deci&s;ion of cau&s;es, doctors of the law, moulahs, and emirs with their green turbans, re&s;ort to them, and pa&s;s the whole day in eating, drinking, and other
<PB N="10" REF="10">
amu&s;ements not to be mentioned. In mo&s;t of them there are little companies, of five or &s;ix &s;inging and dancing boys; two of them play on &s;ome in&s;trument, the others dance and &s;ing: they are dre&s;&s;ed like girls, and accompany words adapted to the purpo&s;e, with wanton looks and ge&s;tures, which will often &s;o plea&s;e their employers, that they will almo&s;t cover the boys faces with ducats, &s;ticking them on with their &s;pittle; and the boys, in their turn, have the dexterity, in the cour&s;e of the dance, to &s;lide them almo&s;t impercep|tibly into their pockets. One would imagine this amu&s;ement and the intoxication of liquor would pro|duce the mo&s;t unnatural effects: not at all. A Turk in liquor is quite different from a Greek. The latter in his cups is lively, enterprizing and de&s;perate; he is noi&s;y and quarrel&s;ome, wants to fight, to kill, and dethrone the Ottoman monarch, that he may re&s;tore the empire to the Chri&s;tians. The Turk, on the con|trary, is lifele&s;s, peaceable, timid, and afraid to utter a &s;ingle word; it is then and then only that a Chri&s;tian may in&s;ult and u&s;e him ill with impunity.</P>
<P>This violation of the law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> prohibiting the u&s;e of wine, is now become &s;o notorious, that the Turki&s;h government does not attempt to apply any remedy to &s;o general a corruption. And indeed with what face could they pretend to reform this evil, when all orders of the &s;tate are more or le&s;s infected by it, from the Grand Signor down to the &s;imple Jani&s;&s;ary;
<PB N="11" REF="11">
not excepting even the mufti, the imans, the moulahs, and the emirs of the &s;acred lineage of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The women and eunuchs in the &s;eraglio, are more addicted to &s;pirituous liquors than wine; of this &s;ome judgment may be formed, by a debt left unpaid at the death of Sultan <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> for 600 ca&s;es of French <HI>liqueurs:</HI> this degeneracy, however, has been the chief cau&s;e of the decline of the empire, and will no doubt ha&s;ten its fall.</P>
<P>Except in their public fe&s;tivals, when licentiou&s;ne&s;s is always extreme, and always allowed; the actors of comedies in Turkey, who are Jews, never exhibit their talents, but within the walls of hou&s;es, where marriages are celebrated, or &s;ome particular entertain|ments given. The&s;e companies of wretched buffoons are either all men or all women.</P>
<P>To give &s;ome idea of their wretched, theatrical per|formances, Baron <HI>Tott</HI> relates the particulars of a public entertainment given on the birth of a prince&s;s, by one of the great officers of &s;tate in the meadows near Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>Two great po&s;ts, forty feet di&s;tant from each other &s;upported a cord fa&s;tened to their upper ends. Round this cord, other cords were tied, to which gla&s;s lamps were fixed at convenient di&s;tances from the objects they were intended to illuminate. The cypher of the Grand Signor, the repre&s;entation of his barge, and
<PB N="12" REF="12">
words taken from the Alcoran, decorated the edifice, during the three days this entertainment la&s;ted; while rope-dancers, a company of Jewi&s;h comedians, and female figure-dancers, amu&s;ed the &s;pectators, till the night was far advanced. This &s;pectacle became &s;till more worthy curio&s;ity, by the light of a &s;core of chafing di&s;hes of iron, rai&s;ed upon &s;takes, in which a red flame was maintained, by burning rays dipped in tar and pine-&s;plinters.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;mal chandeliers were placed in a circle, to give light to the dancers in the center, while tents, prepared for the grand vizir and his company, formed, together with the multitudes who were pre&s;ent, a grand line of circumvallation, of which the women of the populace occupied a part. The illumination without this circle was only to give notice of the entertain|ment, of which the comedy was the mo&s;t valuable article.</P>
<P>A kind of cage, three feet &s;quare, and &s;ix feet high, hung round with a curtain repre&s;ents a hou&s;e, and contains one of the Jewi&s;h actors dre&s;&s;ed like a woman. Another Jew, in the habit of a young Turk, and &s;up|po&s;ed to be enamoured with the lady of the hou&s;e; a valet plea&s;antly ab&s;urd; a fourth Jew dre&s;&s;ed like a woman, and acting the part of gallant; a hu&s;band who is impo&s;ed upon, and, in &s;hort, the characters which are &s;een every where, &s;tand without, and compo&s;e the
<PB N="13" REF="13">
piece. But that which is to be met with no where el&s;e, is the <HI>denouement;</HI> every thing is acted, and nothing left to the imagination of the &s;pectators; and if the &s;ummons of the Muczzin is heard during the&s;e interludes, the mu&s;&s;ulmen turn their faces towards Mecca, whil&s;t the actors continue to play each their part. I &s;hall have &s;aid enough of this &s;trange mixture of momentary devotion and continued indecency, adds the baron, to tho&s;e who perceive that this pic|ture, difficult to de&s;cribe, ought &s;till le&s;s to be de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Some clum&s;y rope-dancers, awkward wre&s;tlers, &s;tupid buffoons, and female figure-dancers, fill up the intervals between one comedy and another. Among the&s;e la&s;t, who&s;e merit, certainly, neither lies in the elegance of their &s;tep, nor propriety of their action, but who give infinite plea&s;ure to the Turks by that talent which is their characteri&s;tic; a young girl, be|tween ten and twelve years old, di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf greatly; and when at the end of every dance, &s;he according to cu&s;tom went round with the plate to receive in money, the value of tho&s;e agreeable ideas which &s;he had rai&s;ed in the company, the Turki&s;h lords put her as it were up to auction, &s;ticking &s;equins on her forehead, to prove their good wi&s;hes. A &s;equin is a piece of gold &s;o light, that putting it on the forehead, it will &s;tick there for &s;ome time, and it is cu&s;tomary with the Turks to recompen&s;e in this
<PB N="14" REF="14">
manner the agility of their dancers. The price of this &s;lave, who&s;e figure was not extraordinary, amounted to twelve pur&s;es or &s;even hundred and fifty pounds; which were given for her to the merchant, by an old molloch or lawyer.</P>
<P>At the fea&s;t of Tchiragan or Tulips, &s;o called, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> becau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ts in illuminating a gar|den, and this flower being that which the Turks mo&s;t admire, the gardens of the haram are laid out in a mo&s;t &s;uperb ta&s;te. Va&s;es of every kind, filled with natural and artificial flowers, are brought for the occa&s;ion, and add to the &s;plendour of an illumination, cau&s;ed by an infinite number of lanterns, coloured lamps, and wax candles, in gla&s;s tubes, reflected on every &s;ide by mirrors di&s;po&s;ed for that purpo&s;e. Shops erected for the rejoicing, and furni&s;hed with different kinds of wares, are occupied by the women of the haram, who repre&s;ent in proper dre&s;&s;es, dealers, and offer the goods they contain for &s;ale. The &s;ultanas, whether &s;i&s;ters, nieces, or cou&s;ins of the emperor, are invited by him to partake of this amu&s;ement; and they as well as his highne&s;s, purcha&s;e in the&s;e &s;hops, trinkets and toys, of which they make each other pre&s;ents; ex|tending likewi&s;e their genero&s;ity to the women of the Grand Signor, who are admitted to this diver&s;ion, or who occupy the &s;hops; and the dances, mu&s;ic, and other recreations prolong the entertainment, till the night is far advanced, which &s;preads a kind of mo|mentary
<PB N="15" REF="15">
gaiety over a place, &s;eemingly, in every other re&s;pect, devoted to &s;adne&s;s and di&s;content.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the amu&s;ements of the &s;eraglio, the Grand Signor frequently diverts him&s;elf in hawking or hunting. Once every year there is a grand hunting party ap|pointed. A large track of country is then inclo&s;ed, to &s;uch an extent, &s;ays <HI>Le Brun,</HI> as would take up &s;everal days to ride over. The inhabitants of all the towns and villages, where it lies, are al&s;o required to give their aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. By this means the game is &s;urrounded and brought into a very confined circle. The Grand Signor then a&s;cends &s;ome eminence, and has the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing it knocked down with bludgeons, which is &s;ometimes not very ea&s;y, e&s;pecially if there are plenty of wild boars among the game.</P>
<P>The ordinary hunt is held every week, during the winter particularly, and la&s;ts from morning to night. The prince attended with a large retinue of fifty or &s;ixty of his hou&s;hold, be&s;ides his hunt&s;men, hunts generally, as we do, hares and foxes; but &s;ometimes wolves, and at others unhoods his falcons, in que&s;t of phea&s;ants and partridges.</P>
<P>When the Grand Signor goes to any of his country &s;eats, he generally travels in a kind of coach, &s;o con|trived that tho&s;e ladies he takes with him can have
<PB N="16" REF="16">
the plea&s;ure of viewing all external objects, without being &s;een them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Their coaches are not at all like ours, but much more convenient for the country; the heat being &s;o great that gla&s;&s;es would be very trouble&s;ome. They are made a good deal in the manner of Dutch &s;tage-coaches, having wooden lattices painted and gilded; the in&s;ide being al&s;o painted with ba&s;kets and no&s;e|gays of flowers, intermixed commonly with little poetical mottos. They are covered all over with &s;carlet cloth, lined with &s;ilk, and very often richly embroidered and fringed. This covering entirely hides the per&s;ons in them, but may be thrown back at plea&s;ure, and thus permits the ladies to peep through the lattices. They hold four people very conveni|ently, &s;eated on cu&s;hions, but not rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;ultan, when he wants to make the common people believe he has no fears, goes out incognito in a hired boat, with only two or three attendants. I have &s;een him come out in this manner from a back door of his garden, &s;ays Lady <HI>C.</HI> ju&s;t after his fleet had &s;ailed; a fire the night before was calculated to renew his fears, if he had lo&s;t them. But here, it is known when he &s;allies forth without guards or ceremony. It is like children who &s;ing in the dark, to make their nur&s;es believe that they are not afraid.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="17">Travelling is cheaper in Turkey than in any other part of the world, on account of the &s;mall expence of hor&s;e-hire, and the cheapne&s;s of provi&s;ions; and particularly to Chri&s;tians, who have only to apply, through the medium of their amba&s;&s;ador, to the of|ficers of the Porte, who will grant them a <HI>Firman</HI> from the Grand Signor, by which, nearly all their travelling charges are borne at his expence. There are no &s;tated po&s;ts in Turkey; but at the di&s;tance of three or four leagues, there are hou&s;es of enter|tainment, and hor&s;es &s;tationed for the Grand Signor's couriers, and tho&s;e per&s;ons to whom he gives the&s;e <HI>Firmans,</HI> or orders.</P>
<P>When a nobleman or gentleman having a <HI>Fir|man,</HI> arrives at one of the&s;e &s;tages, there are per&s;ons ready to take charge of his baggage and hor&s;es, while he refre&s;hes him&s;elf, and provide, him with fre&s;h ones. There is always &s;ome refre&s;hment to be had at the&s;e places; &s;o that let a traveller arrive at what|ever hour of the day or night he plea&s;es, he is certain of being well entertained.</P>
<P>As for the caravan&s;eras, or inns, where tho&s;e travellers &s;top, who have no Firman, they are to be met with at proper di&s;tances, in almo&s;t every town or village. Tho&s;e in the towns, as we have remarked, are magnificently built of &s;tone, and covered with

<P>Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> gives us the following de&s;cription of a caravan&s;era in Romania&mdash;In our journey, &s;ays he, we lodged in a large and commodious Khan, capable of accommodating three or four hundred per&s;ons; the entrance was through a grand &s;tone portal, into a quadrangle, bigger than the Royal Exchange, with a large fountain in the middle. On each &s;ide were apartments without furniture; one &s;ide for the women, and the other for the men. From this quadrangle i&s;&s;ued &s;tables capable of holding 5000 hor&s;es. It is entirely built of free-&s;tone, with regular ma&s;onry, and the whole covered with &s;heet lead. It mu&s;t have co&s;t an im|men&s;e &s;um, and was built through the vanity and devotion of a Grand Vizier; the Turks as we have

<P>The Turks are accu&s;tomed to chew opium, as our &s;eamen chew tobacco, and I apprehend, upon the &s;ame principle. Sailors &s;ay it keeps them warm, and it is well known that per&s;ons accu&s;tomed to opium, feel a chilline&s;s upon leaving it off. Being by their religion forbidden the u&s;e of wine, and requiring &s;omething, occa&s;ionally, to rai&s;e their &s;pirits, was the origin of this cu&s;tom; and the plea&s;ing in|toxication, or in&s;en&s;ibility it brings on, with the uncommon flow of &s;pirits it afterwards occa&s;ions, has led them to a continuance of this de&s;tructive habit. A Turk will chew as much opium in a day, as would de&s;troy half-a-dozen men unaccu&s;tomed to it: a convincing proof that habit is &s;econd nature, and that what is one man's food, is another man's poi&s;on.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have given them&s;elves up to the im|moderate u&s;e of this drug, are ea&s;ily known by the kind of rickets which, in the end, it never fails to produce. There are &s;hops in a particular part of the city, on purpo&s;e for the &s;ale of it; the lovers of opium go into them, and call for a di&s;h of coffee; after which they &s;moke two or three pipes, and then &s;wallow the pernicious drug, in pills, drinking with them a cup of cold water; after this they take ano|ther
<PB N="20" REF="20">
di&s;h of coffee, and a fre&s;h pipe, and while this la&s;t pipe is in their mouth, they begin to feel a vo|luptuous &s;en&s;ation, which thrills through all their veins, and lulls their &s;en&s;es in &s;uch a manner, that they remain in a &s;tate of inaction, with their eyes half open, as if they were between &s;leeping and waking. They continue in this &s;en&s;ation two or three hours, according to the quantity they have taken; during which time they pretend they have ta&s;ted the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ual delights, it is po&s;&s;ible for the human body to enjoy, and that it is in this &s;tate of intoxication their Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> in&s;pires them with good ideas, and communicates to them his own and the Divine will. The pale and melancholy figures which the&s;e mi&s;erable &s;laves to their intemperate vo|luptuou&s;ne&s;s exhibit, would be &s;ufficient to rai&s;e our pity, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> did not their lengthened necks, their heads turned on one &s;ide, their back-bone di&s;torted, their &s;houlders rai&s;ed up to their ears, and a number of other extragavant attitudes which re&s;ult from this di&s;ea&s;e, pre&s;ent a mo&s;t ridiculous and melancholy picture. Tho&s;e mo&s;t u&s;ed to this pernicious cu&s;tom, he adds, will &s;wallow four pills at once, each larger than an olive.

<P>There is one cu&s;tom, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> peculiar to this country&mdash;Adoption&mdash;very common among the Turks, and yet more &s;o among the Greeks and Ar|menians. Not having it in their power to give their e&s;tates to a friend or di&s;tant relation; to avoid their falling into the Grand Signor's trea&s;ury, when they are not likely to have any children of their own, they will choo&s;e &s;ome pretty child of either &s;ex, among&s;t the meane&s;t people, carry the child and its parents before the Cadi, and then declare they receive it for their heir. The parents, at the &s;ame time, renounce all future claim to it; a writing is drawn and witne&s;|&s;ed, and a child thus adopted, cannot be di&s;inherited. Notwith&s;tanding this noble provi&s;ion, many common beggars have been &s;een, that have refu&s;ed to part with their children, in this manner, to &s;ome of the riche&s;t among the Greeks; &s;o powerful is the in&s;tinc|tive affection natural to parents, though the adopting father is generally very tender, as they call it, to

the child of his &s;oul. I own, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> this cu&s;tom plea&s;es me much better than our ab&s;urd one of leaving legacies and e&s;tates to per&s;ons of our own name; it is much more rea&s;onable to make an infant happy and rich, whom I educate after my own man|ner, brought up in the Turki&s;h phra&s;e, upon my knees, and who has learned to look upon me with a filial a&s;pect; than to give an e&s;tate to one without merit, or relation to me&mdash;merely becau&s;e he bears the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>The principal recreations of the Turks, are &s;moak|ing and playing at che&s;s, but they never play for mo|ney, that being contrary to the precepts of the alcoran. They will likewi&s;e li&s;ten patiently for hours together, to the &s;tories and buffooneries of their merry-an|drews and juglers. They never, by way of exerci&s;e, walk backwards and forwards in a chamber, or in any public walk, as is the cu&s;tom among us, but look upon it as ridiculous, and laugh at the Chri&s;tians for &s;o doing. Seeing an Engli&s;hman walking up and down a room, one a&s;ked a friend of his, if he was not di&s;turbed in mind.</P>
<P>The diver&s;ions of tho&s;e bred up to a military life are very different. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t in &s;hooting at a mark with bows and arrows, at which exerci&s;e they are very expert; they are likewi&s;e very adroit in

<P>Another diver&s;ion is fi&s;hing, and the manner in which they fi&s;h has &s;omething extraordinary in it: they take this diver&s;ion in the night time, and make u&s;e of fire, for this purpo&s;e; fa&s;tening an iron grate at the end of a &s;tick, and burning &s;traw on it, or &s;mall wood which makes a great blaze; the fi&s;h are attracted by the light, gather round it in &s;hoals, and are caught in a net laid to en&s;nare them.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic al&s;o is a cu&s;tomary and mo&s;t familiar amu&s;e|ment with them.

<P>Their chamber mu&s;ic is on the contrary very &s;oft, and if its monotony of &s;emi-tones, which is at fir&s;t offen&s;ive, &s;hould be condemned, it mu&s;t be allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s a kind of melancholy expre&s;&s;ion, with which the Turks are extremely affected.

<P>Turki&s;h mu&s;ic, adds Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> though very different from ours, is by no means di&s;agreeable; it con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly in uni&s;ons. There is a temple in Pera in which is performed twice a week, the dance of the Dervi&s;es, one of the mo&s;t extraordinary ceremonies to be &s;een any where: Chri&s;tians are admitted to a &s;ight of it, the Turks e&s;teeming it &s;o delightful a performance, as to induce every one who &s;ees it to turn Mahometan.

<P>THE Turks have a notion that when a woman leaves off bringing forth children, it is becau&s;e &s;he is too old, let her face &s;ay what it will to the con|trary. This opinion makes the ladies &s;o ready to give proofs of their youth, which is as nece&s;&s;ary here, in order to be a received beauty, as it is to produce proofs of nobility, to be admitted a knight of Malta. They do not content them&s;elves with u&s;ing the natural means, but fly to all &s;orts of quack|eries, to avoid the &s;candal of being pa&s;t child-bearing, and often de&s;troy them&s;elves in &s;o doing. Without any exaggeration, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> all the women of my acquaintance have twelve or thirteen children; and the old ones boa&s;t of having had five and twenty or thirty, and are re&s;pected according to the number they have produced.&mdash;When they are with child it is their common expre&s;&s;ion to &s;ay, they hope God will be &s;o merciful as to &s;end them two this time; and
<PB N="27" REF="27">
when they have been a&s;ked how they expected to provide for &s;uch a flock as they de&s;ire? they an&s;wer, the plague will certainly kill half of them; which indeed generally happens, without much concern to the parents, who are &s;atisfied with the vanity of having brought forth &s;o plentifully. What is mo&s;t wonderful, is, the exemption they &s;eem to enjoy from the cur&s;e entailed on the &s;ex, that of bring|ing forth children with labour and pain; they &s;ee company on the day of their delivery, and at the fortnight's end return vi&s;its, and dre&s;s them&s;elves out in all their jewels and new cloaths. There are no profe&s;&s;ed midwives, neighbours a&s;&s;i&s;ting each other in the&s;e kind offices.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of an approaching labour in the Seraglio, the Vizier, the Mufti, and the grand officers, civil and miltary, are &s;ent for to wait the moment of delivery, in the hall of the Sopha, which is the intermediate apartment that &s;eparates the Ha|rem from the re&s;t of the buildings, occupied by the Grand Signior and his hou&s;hold. Immediately after the delivery, the Ki&s;lar Aga comes out of the Harem with the infant, to pre&s;ent it to the great officers of &s;tate, who draw up a certificate of its birth and &s;ex; after which the guns of the Sopha are fired, and the&s;e are repeated by tho&s;e on the cape of the Seraglio, and at Tophana. To the&s;e different &s;alutes &s;ucceed
<PB N="28" REF="28">
tho&s;e of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, the Fleet and the Tower of Leander.</P>
<P>Marriage among the Mahometans, is only a civil act or contract entered into in the pre&s;ence of the Cadi or judge, who, in this ca&s;e, officiates only as a common notary. There is no religious ceremony performed on this occa&s;ion, nor is the bride even re|quired to be pre&s;ent. The father or &s;ome of her re|lations appear in her behalf, and this ceremony through cu&s;tom has the force of law. The portion as well as the paraphernalia, which are objects of the mo&s;t importance are regi&s;tered in this in&s;trument; which &s;ecures the return of them to be made in ca&s;e of divorce. After the contract is &s;igned, the relations of the bride bring her with great ceremony to her hu&s;band's hou&s;e, who undre&s;&s;es and puts her to bed.</P>
<P>A very remarkable circum&s;tance in the Turki&s;h marriages is that the wife never brings a portion to the hu&s;band, but the hu&s;band on the contrary a&s;&s;igns one to his wife. This marriage portion cannot be regi&s;tered in the marriage contract, becau&s;e it is only &s;tipulated, and not payable except in ca&s;e of the death of the hu&s;band or of a divorce. In this it differs from the Kapin which becomes due at the expiration of the term pre&s;cribed by the contract. This is &s;o true, that when a woman demands &s;eparation from her
<PB N="29" REF="29">
hu&s;band on account of ill-treatment, or for want of a proper maintenance, &s;he mu&s;t give up her portion in pre&s;ence of the judge, and pronounce the following form of words, u&s;ual when &s;uch a divorce is ob|tained: <HI>Nikiahum khalal, bachum agad;</HI> i. e. "My portion re&s;igned, my per&s;on free." If the hu&s;band &s;olicits the divorce, he is obliged to allow his wife her portion, her cloaths, and her jewels, and &s;he then re&s;tores him the contract in pre&s;ence of the judge.</P>
<P>They have likewi&s;e an inferior kind of marriage which they call <HI>Kapin.</HI> This contract is likewi&s;e made before the Cadi, but it is only for a limited time, and a &s;um of money is &s;tipulated to be paid by the hu&s;band to the woman, if he puts her away at the expiration of the time. This &s;pecies of marriage was in&s;tituted for the convenience and plea&s;ure of &s;trangers and travellers. The Turks are allowed &s;even of the&s;e wives, but few of them will have more than one or two on account of the heavy expences attending them. Their other wives are their women-&s;laves, and of the&s;e every man may have as many as he plea&s;es; and the children he has by them are con&s;i|dered as legitimate, and have as much right to their father's inheritance as any of the re&s;t, if he en|franchi&s;es them by his will; otherwi&s;e they remain &s;laves to the elde&s;t by the lawful wife: but if a Turk takes a &s;lave to his bed, and &s;he has children by him,
<PB N="30" REF="30">
he is not allowed to di&s;po&s;e of her again, but &s;he be|comes one of his family. A Mahometan may marry women of any religion under the &s;un, provided there are books written or printed in its favour: even the eunuchs are allowed to marry, and &s;everal of them have many wives, Mahomet him&s;elf having &s;et the example. A Turk is allowed four legitimate wives, and he is limited to this number rather from economy than the rigour of the law; for as he is obliged to make a &s;ettlement upon each at his marriage, the ex|pence would be in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h laws forbid maids and married women to unveil to any man, but the hu&s;band, or relations within a certain degree. A Turk therefore marries the daughter of his neighbour or his widow without knowing her. He can only determine by the report of his own women, or &s;ome per&s;on by whom &s;he has been &s;een.</P>
<P>They relate a plea&s;ant &s;tory of a man who, as is u&s;ually the ca&s;e, not having &s;een his wife till after his marriage, and finding her far from hand&s;ome, two or three days after their nuptials, when &s;he de&s;ired him to name the per&s;ons who were to have the privilege of <HI>Namaharem;</HI> that is, of entering her Harem; (this is generally re&s;tricted to the father, uncle, and brothers of the married lady) that &s;he might not endeavour to
<PB N="31" REF="31">
conceal her&s;elf from them, returned for an&s;wer, "I give you my free permi&s;&s;ion, my dear, to &s;hew your|&s;elf to all the men in the world, except to my&s;elf."</P>
<P>On a moment's reflection we &s;hall perceive that this law of <HI>Namaharem</HI> cannot be &s;o &s;crupulou&s;ly ob|&s;erved among the common people, as by tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ituation places them more at their ea&s;e. The arti&s;t may call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his eyes to direct his choice, when the want of fortune renders his right to a plurality u&s;ele&s;s. Misfortune almo&s;t always meets with &s;omething by which it is con&s;oled. It is only the abu&s;e of happine&s;s that is de&s;titute of every alle|viation.</P>
<P>Plurality of wives is of this latter kind; it leads to extravagant expences. By whom can they be &s;up|ported, except by tho&s;e who having been engaged in commerce are become rich by their economy, or by &s;uch as have arrived at opulence by their employ|ments. The fortune of the&s;e per&s;ons is merely per&s;onal, which avidity accumulates, and terror conceals; which luxury di&s;&s;ipates and opportunity renews. The un|certainty of their &s;ituation increa&s;es their ha&s;te to ac|quire and to &s;quander.</P>
<P>The Turks rarely leave large fortunes to their chil|dren. Sums &s;ufficiently con&s;iderable to &s;erve for
<PB N="32" REF="32">
portions would be capable of exciting the avidity of the Sultan; and he would ea&s;ily find pretences to &s;ieze them, by &s;earching into the means by which they were acquired.</P>
<P>A Turk therefore is &s;eldom rich enough to main|tain any con&s;iderable Harem, till by the favour of his patron he has arrived at employments of great authority, and where this authority becomes lucrative in proportion as it is abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>But, mixed with other young per&s;ons, whom the &s;ame ambitious expectations have attached to the &s;ame ma&s;ter; reduced to live among men only; car|ried away by the violence of his pa&s;&s;ions; &s;eparated from the women, though excited by knowing they are near; if &s;uch a Turk is obliged to cede to nature, he cannot but wander from her laws.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een that the Turki&s;h women who cannot be procured but by marriage, nor known till that has taken place, are equally reduced to live entirely among them&s;elves. What therefore mu&s;t be their education? Born in opulence, they are ei|ther the daughters of a legal wife, or of a &s;lave, the favourite of the moment. Their brothers and &s;i&s;ters have had different mothers, who were no other than &s;laves in the &s;ame hou&s;e. Without any employment

but that furni&s;hed by jealou&s;y; &s;carcely able to read or write; or if they read, reading nothing but the alcoran; expo&s;ed in their hot baths to all the incon|veniences of a forced per&s;piration, &s;o frequently re|peated as to de&s;troy the fre&s;hne&s;s of their complexion, and the grace of their features, even before they are marriagable; indolent through pride, and frequently mortified by the efficacy of the means employed be|fore their eyes to plea&s;e their proprietors; what gra|tification can &s;uch women &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott</HI> be &s;up|po&s;ed to give their hu&s;bands?</P>
<P>It is very remarkable that the concubinage of the hu&s;band does not make the wife jealous, as in Chri&s;|tian countries; however, the hu&s;bands are obliged to care&s;s their wives once a week at lea&s;t, if not they may lodge a complaint with the Cadi, and demand a divorce if they think proper: complaints of this kind are very frequent among the lower cla&s;s of people; as to the better &s;ort they know how to indemnify them&s;elves, by more agreeable and more &s;ecret means. The di&s;honour attending the infidelity, wan|tonne&s;s and lubricity of Turki&s;h wives, does not fall upon the hu&s;band, but upon the relations of the wo|man who made the contract for her before the Cadi. The Grand Signor is not obliged to marry, but the fir&s;t four women who have children by him are called the Sultanas, his wives.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="34">Lady <HI>M.</HI> mentions two other particulars re&s;pecting their marriages, worthy of being remarked: when a man has divorced his wife in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, he can take her again upon no other terms, than per|mitting another man to pa&s;s a night with her, and there are &s;ome examples of tho&s;e who have &s;ubmitted to this law, rather than not have back their beloved. The other point of doctrine is very extraordinary. Any woman that dies unmarried, is looked upon to die in a &s;tate of reprobation. To confirm this be|lief they rea&s;on, that the end of the creation of wo|man is to increa&s;e and multiply; and that &s;he is only properly employed in the work of her calling, when &s;he is bringing forth children or taking care of them, which are all the virtues that God expects from her. Our vulgar notion that they admit not wo|men to have &s;ouls, is a mi&s;take. It is true, they &s;ay, women are not of &s;o elevated a nature, and there|fore mu&s;t not hope for admi&s;&s;ion into the paradi&s;e appointed for the men, who are to be entertained by cele&s;tial beauties. But there is a place of hap|pine&s;s de&s;tined for &s;ouls of the inferior order, where all good women are to be in eternal bli&s;s. Many of them are very &s;uper&s;titious, and will not remain widows ten days, for fear of dying in the reprobate &s;tate of a u&s;ele&s;s creature. But tho&s;e that like their liberty, and are not &s;laves to their religion, content them&s;elves with marrying when they are afraid of
<PB N="35" REF="35">
dying. This is a piece of theology very different from that which teaches that nothing is more accept|able to God than a vow of perpetual virginity.</P>
<P>It is very plea&s;ant, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> to ob&s;erve how tenderly the admirable Mr. <HI>Hill,</HI> who &s;o gravely a&s;&s;erts he &s;aw in Sancta Sophia, a &s;weating pillar, very bal&s;amic for di&s;ordered heads; as well as all his brethren voyage-writers, lament the mi&s;erable confinement of the Turki&s;h ladies, who are, perhaps, more free than any ladies in the univer&s;e, and are the only women in the world that lead a life of un|interrupted plea&s;ure, exempt from cares, their whole time being &s;pent in vi&s;iting, bathing, or the agreeable amu&s;ement of &s;pending money, and inventing new fa&s;hions. A hu&s;band would be thought mad that exacted any degree of economy from his wife, who&s;e expences are no way limited but by her fancy. It is <HI>his</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s to get money, and <HI>hers</HI> to &s;pend it, and this noble prerogative extends it&s;elf to the very meane&s;t of the &s;ex. Here is a fellow who carries embroidered handkerchiefs on his back, to &s;ell, and as mi&s;erable a figure as &s;uch a mean dealer may be &s;uppo&s;ed, his wife will &s;corn to wear any thing le&s;s than her cloth of gold, her ermine furs, and a very hand&s;ome &s;et of jewels on her head. It is true they have no places of amu&s;ement but the bagnios, and
<PB N="36" REF="36">
there can only be &s;een by their own &s;ex; however, it is a diver&s;ion they take delight in.</P>
<P>At one of the&s;e, adds Lady <HI>M.</HI> I had an oppor|tunity of &s;eeing a Turki&s;h bride received, and all the ceremony u&s;ed on that occa&s;ion, which made me recollect the epithlamium of <HI>Helen,</HI> by <HI>Theocritus,</HI> and it &s;eems to me that the &s;ame cu&s;toms have con|tinued ever &s;ince. All the female friends, relations and acquaintances of the two families newly allied, meet at the bagnio, and &s;everal others go out of curio|&s;ity, to the number of two hundred women. Tho&s;e that were or had been married, placed them&s;elves round the rooms on the marble &s;o&s;as; but the virgins very ha&s;tily threw off their cloaths, and appeared with|out any ornament or covering than their own long hair braided with pearl, or ribbon. Two of them met the bride at the door, conducted by her mother and another grave relation. She was a beautiful maid of about &s;eventeen, very richly dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;hining with jewels, but was pre&s;ently reduced to a &s;tate of nature. Two others filled &s;ilver gilt pots with per|fume, and began the proce&s;&s;ion, the re&s;t following in proce&s;&s;ion to the number of thirty. The leaders &s;ung an epithalamium an&s;wered by the others in chorus, and the la&s;t two led the fair bride, her eyes fixed on the ground with a charming affectation of mode&s;ty. In this order they marched round the three large rooms
<PB N="37" REF="37">
of the bagnio. It is not ea&s;y to repre&s;ent the beauty of this &s;ight, mo&s;t of them being well proportioned and white &s;kinned; all of them perfectly &s;mooth, and poli&s;hed by the frequent u&s;e of bathing. After having made their tour, the bride was again led to every matron round the rooms, who &s;aluted her with a compliment and a pre&s;ent; &s;ome of jewels, others of pieces of &s;tuff handkerchiefs, or little gallantries of that nature, which &s;he thanked them for by ki&s;&s;ing their hands.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now entertain our readers with the ce|remony of marriage among the Armenians, at Con|&s;tantinople. The lady is equally invi&s;ible as among the Turks, and the contract is made by the friends and relations of the parties. On the day fixed for celebrating the nuptials, one of their prie&s;ts goes to the hou&s;e of the young lady, and gives the nuptial benediction. The bride is clo&s;ely veiled during the whole time of the ceremony, and when over, the hu&s;band returns home; at night the bride is brought to his hou&s;e, &s;urrounded by her relations, where &s;he is conducted to an an apartment filled with women, to partake of an entertainment; the bridegroom en|tains her male relations with tho&s;e of his own in a chamber apart. When the entertainment is over, they all go, except the bridegroom, and pay their compliments to the bride, to which the lady makes no
<PB N="38" REF="38">
reply; for was &s;he to utter a &s;yllable, &s;he would be deemed a bold, wanton hu&s;&s;ey; after this &s;he is con|ducted to the nuptial chamber, where the bridegroom is ready to receive her. She &s;till continues veiled; and after they have placed her on a &s;tool, the company withdraw. As &s;oon as they are alone, the bridegroom approaches the bride, and, whil&s;t &s;he is trembling with fear, lifts up her veil; it is then for the fir&s;t time, he beholds a face that is to be familiar to him for life. Whatever may be his &s;entiments, he no doubt conceals them, and according to cu&s;tom, em|braces her; no return is made to his care&s;&s;es, but by a downca&s;t look, or by tears; and as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible &s;he gives the fir&s;t token of her &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, by ri&s;ing to fill a gla&s;s of wine, and hand him &s;ome &s;weetmeats; this done, &s;he fills another for her&s;elf, the fir&s;t &s;he pre|&s;ents to her hu&s;band, and then, touching each others gla&s;&s;es, they drink to their mutual happine&s;s. The bridegroom then undre&s;&s;es his bride and him&s;elf, and the moment they are getting into bed, contrives to give the &s;ignal for a concert of mu&s;ic, which is im|mediately performed in the anti-chamber, accom|panied by voices, in honour of Hymen.</P>
<P>We will clo&s;e the&s;e details of the marriage-cere|mony in Turkey, with Lady <HI>Craven's</HI> ob&s;ervations on their Harem, or apartment for the ladies. The Harem, &s;ays &s;he, is &s;acred, even to that rapacious
<PB N="39" REF="39">
power which has &s;eized the ma&s;ter's life, only becau&s;e he was too rich. It may be &s;aid that in Turkey likewi&s;e, women are &s;afe from an idle, curious, im|pertinent public; and what is called the <HI>world</HI> can never di&s;turb the ea&s;e and quiet of a Turki&s;h wife. Her talents, her beauty, her happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, are equally concealed from malicious ob&s;ervers&mdash;Of mi&s;ery, unle&s;s a Turki&s;h woman is beyond exception unrea&s;onable, her portion cannot be very great; for the wife who&s;e wretched hu&s;band earns &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by carrying water, or burthens, &s;its at home bedecked with jewels, or goes out as her fancy directs, and the fruits of his labour are appropriated to her u&s;e. In great hou&s;es, the wives of the Turks, who compo&s;e the train of a Turki&s;h hu&s;band, are de&s;tined to be &s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;tate of the fir&s;t wife, and &s;he treats them as &s;he plea&s;es in her Harem.</P>
<P>It is not the cu&s;tom among the Turks to make enquiries about their wives, and it would be con|&s;idered the height of indecorum in Turkey, to a&s;k a Mahometan how his wife did.</P>
<P>The art of medicine is very little known among the Turks, being a very healthy people they need few phy&s;icians, and it is not without &s;ome ri&s;k that they exerci&s;e their &s;kill, in this country; for &s;hould their patients die under their hands, they may be
<PB N="40" REF="40">
accu&s;ed of having killed them. This excellent &s;tate of health which they enjoy, is attributed to their frequent u&s;e of the baths, and their extraordinary temperance. In common di&s;orders, &s;uch as the head-ach, tooth-ach, pains in the ear, &amp;c. they u&s;ually &s;carify, lance or burn the part affected, and this ge|nerally proves a &s;overeign cure. If we may credit Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> the chirurgical art does not &s;eem to be in the lea&s;t countenanced in this country.</P>
<P>There are few phy&s;icians, fewer apothecaries, and no &s;urgeons here, &s;ays his lord&s;hip, the inhabitants therefore, he concludes, can know little of the horrid mi&s;chiefs occa&s;ioned by a certain di&s;ea&s;e we labour under in great cities.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t phy&s;ician to the Grand Signor, &s;ays <HI>Pey&s;on|nel,</HI> is honoured with the title <HI>Hekim Bachi Effendi,</HI> and wears the large round turban called Eurf, the badge of the fir&s;t cla&s;s of the law profe&s;&s;ors. No phy&s;ician whatever, native or foreigner, can exerci&s;e that pro|fe&s;&s;ion without his con&s;ent, nor open a &s;hop without his licence. It may appear &s;urprizing to our readers to hear of phy&s;icians opening a &s;hop, but &s;uch is the e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom at Con&s;tantinople, and throughout all Turkey. It is the practice of all the phy&s;icians who are Greeks or Jews, and even many Europeans, who are almo&s;t all apothecaries likewi&s;e. The Grand
<PB N="41" REF="41">
Signor in his indi&s;po&s;itions frequently con&s;ults Euro|pean phy&s;icians, who, when they are fortunate enough to obtain his confidence, often acquire an influence in matters foreign to their profe&s;&s;ion; but they are not allowed to admini&s;ter any remedies to the Sultan, without the con&s;ent, and even pre&s;ence, of the <HI>Hekim Bachi,</HI> to whom the care of the &s;overeign's health by right belongs.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e dreadful &s;tories told of the plague, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> have very little foundation in truth. I own I have much ado to reconcile my&s;elf to the &s;ound of a word, which has always given me &s;uch terrible ideas, though I am convinced there is little more in it than in a fever. As a proof of this we pa&s;&s;ed through two or three towns mo&s;t violently infected. In the very next hou&s;e where we lay, two per&s;ons died of it. Luckily for me, I was &s;o well deceived that I knew nothing of the matter; and was made to believe, that our &s;econd cook had only a great cold. However we left our doctor to take care of him, and they both came to us afterwards in perfect health, and I was then let into the &s;ecret, that he had had the plague. There are many that e&s;cape it, neither is the air ever infected. There can be no doubt it would be as ea&s;y a matter to root it out here, as out of Italy and France; but it does &s;o little mi&s;chief, they are not very &s;olicitous about it, and are con|tent
<PB N="42" REF="42">
to &s;uffer this one di&s;temper in&s;tead of our variety, which they are utterly unacquainted with.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>B.</HI> likewi&s;e, at the very beginning of his remarks on Con&s;tantinople, has words to the &s;ame effect; and fir&s;t, &s;ays he, I can a&s;&s;uredly affirm that the plague there is not &s;o dangerous as we imagine, nor do I look upon it more contagious than other epidemic fevers; be&s;ides, mankind peri&s;h by &s;uch various, invi&s;ible and unknown infections, that the di&s;ea&s;es incident to peculiar countries, &s;hould never prevent a per&s;on of &s;en&s;e from vi&s;iting or re&s;iding in them.</P>
<P>The &s;mall-pox, which u&s;ed to be &s;o fatal in this country, is entirely harmle&s;s in Turkey, by the in|vention of ingrafting, which is the term they give to inoculation. It is a &s;et of old women there, who make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to perform the operation, which they do every autumn, in the month of Sep|tember, when the great heat is abated. People &s;end to one another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the &s;mall-pox; they even make parties for this purpo&s;e, and when they are met, commonly fifteen or &s;ixteen together, the old woman comes with a nut-&s;hell full of the matter of the be&s;t &s;ort of &s;mall-pox, and a&s;ks what vein they plea&s;e to have opened. She immediately rips open that they offer
<PB N="43" REF="43">
to her, with a large needle, which gives no more pain than a common &s;cratch, and puts into the vein as much matter as can lie upon the head of her needle; &s;he then binds up the little wound with a hollow bit of &s;hell, and in this manner opens four or five veins. The Greeks &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly open one in the middle of the forehead, one in each arm, and one on the brea&s;t to mark the &s;ign of the cro&s;s; but this has a very ill effect; all the&s;e wounds leaving little &s;cars, and is not done by tho&s;e that are not &s;uper&s;titious, but who chu&s;e to have them in the leg, or that part of the arm that is concealed. The effect which this in|grafting produces, is nearly &s;imilar to the effect it has in England, (and it is to her lady&s;hip alone we owe this &s;alutary cu&s;tom having been introduced into this country.) The children, or young patients, play together all the re&s;t of the day, and are in perfect health to the eighth. Then the fever begins to &s;eize them, and they keep their beds two days, very &s;eldom three. They have very rarely above twenty or thirty in their faces, which never mark; and in eight days time they are as well as before their illne&s;s. Where they are wounded, there remains running &s;ores during the di&s;temper, which is no doubt a great relief to it. So many thou&s;ands undergo this opera|tion every year, that they may be &s;aid to have the &s;mall-pox here by way of diver&s;ion, as they take the wa|ters
<PB N="44" REF="44">
in other countries. There is no example of any one dying of it.</P>
<P>If a Mahometan is very &s;eriou&s;ly indi&s;po&s;ed, it is the cu&s;tom in Turkey, as in other countries, for the prie&s;ts to go and pray by him, and if they find his end approaching, to join with his friends in recommend|ing a chearful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Divine will, again&s;t which it would be impious either to murmur or re|pine. On his death the women in the Harem &s;et up &s;uch hideous howlings, as if they were in the ago|nies of de&s;pair. Preparations are then made for his interment, which are much the &s;ame as with us; ex|cept that the colour of the coffin in which the body is placed, is painted differently, according to the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the per&s;on to be interred; if he was a &s;ol|dier, it is red; if of the family of <HI>Mahomet</HI> green, and that of any other per&s;on, &s;ome writers &s;ay white, others black.</P>
<P>Mourning, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> is not worn by the Turks; but although this manner of paying re&s;pect to our decea&s;ed relations is certainly of little con&s;e|quence, the ha&s;te with which they bury their dead certainly is not &s;o. It &s;eems, &s;ays he, as if this na|tion, naturally &s;o grave and plegmatic, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed ac|tivity in that bu&s;ine&s;s alone. They &s;carcely wait five or &s;ix hours, before they perform this la&s;t duty to
<PB N="45" REF="45">
their kindred; and are not prevented by any fear le&s;t tho&s;e they bury &s;hould not be actually dead. The misfortunes which re&s;ult from this practice are &s;carce ever known. Yet I have &s;een a Turk, &s;ays the Baron, taken up again; who, recovering from his in&s;en&s;ibility, had &s;trength enough to cry out, and make him&s;elf heard; but he was &s;till in &s;ome danger of becoming the victim of ceremony, or rather of the di&s;like which the Judge and Iman, di&s;covered to re&s;tore the dues they had already received.</P>
<P>To this abominable hurry in burying their dead, the Turks who carry the bier, add an extreme quick|ne&s;s of pace; Mahometans believing the decea&s;ed to remain in a &s;uffering &s;tate till the end of this ceremony.</P>
<P>Relations and friends attend the corps to the grave, the prie&s;ts marching in the van, the women in the rear, who every in&s;tant &s;et up &s;uch piteous cries, beat|ing their brea&s;ts and tearing their hair, as if &s;orrow had bereaved them of their &s;en&s;es. When they come to the burial place, the body, contrary to the cu&s;tom of this, and other Chri&s;tian countries, is taken out of the coffin and put into the grave, for the Turks never bury their dead in a coffin. It is depo&s;ited in the ground in &s;uch a manner, that the corps may &s;it upright to undergo the examination of the angels, which are believed to re&s;ort to the grave to en|quire
<PB N="46" REF="46">
into the faith of the decea&s;ed. The mourners then depart. When the grave is filled up, the poorer &s;ort of people erect a &s;tone over the head of the de|decea&s;ed, for the angel that examines them to &s;it upon.</P>
<P>After the interment has taken place, the women make frequent vi&s;its to to the tomb of the decea&s;ed, where they pa&s;s &s;everal hours at a time. The friends and relations likewi&s;e go there to pray to God, that he would be plea&s;ed to deliver him from tho&s;e pains, which the black angels might inflict; and, calling him by his name, they cry, "Fear nothing, an&s;wer boldly;" for they have a notion that the &s;oul returns again to the body, and that as &s;oon as any per&s;on is interred, two black &s;pirits, of an hideous form, come into the grave and take hold of the decea&s;ed, by the tuft of hair, which the Turks always leave on their head for this purpo&s;e, and interrogate him in the&s;e words. <HI>Who is thy God? What is thy religion? Who is thy pro|phet?</HI> To which he is to reply, <HI>My God is the true God, my religion is the true religion, and my prophet is</HI> Mahomet. But if the decea&s;ed is &s;elf-convicted on account of the number of his &s;ins, then his guilt makes him cry out through fear, <HI>Thou art my God, and my prophet, and I believe in thee.</HI> Upon this reply, they &s;ay one of the evil &s;pirits gives him &s;uch a blow on the head, with a bar of iron, as drives him &s;even fathoms deep in the earth, from which the other im|mediately
<PB N="47" REF="47">
draws him up again with an iron hook; but no &s;ooner is he drawn up, than the fir&s;t knocks him down again, and &s;o they continue tormenting him till the day of judgment.</P>
<P>But if he returns a favourable an&s;wer, the two black &s;pirits in&s;tantly leave him, and two others whiter than &s;now come in their place, and &s;eat them&s;elves, one at his head, and the other at his feet; where they &s;tay by him till the day of judgment. Many per&s;ons bring victuals and drink to the graves, and leave it there for travellers, that they may pray for the dead, for who&s;e &s;ake it is there laid.</P>
<P>The interment of the Grand Signor does not dif|fer from that of others, except in the importance of the great officers who accompany the body to the mo&s;que. Of the latter, it is cu&s;tomary for each emperor to build one; and in the court of the mo&s;que a cupola is con&s;tructed, under which the corp&s;e is to be depo&s;ited; and, it is is to be remem|bered, that the Turki&s;h emperors are buried with the &s;ame celerity as their &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The burial places for the dead are very numerous, and, in a manner, &s;urround Con&s;tantinople and Pera, forming very &s;hady romantic walks, as the trees and grave-&s;tones are huddled together in a confu&s;ed
<PB N="48" REF="48">
manner, both pre&s;enting great variety to tho&s;e who ramble among them. It is difficult to give a ju&s;t idea of the beauty of the trees; which, particularly in the&s;e burial places, are never touched; they &s;pread therefore, and grow in the mo&s;t luxuriant and graceful di&s;order. There are no fences to re&s;train or mark the form of their burial places, &s;ome extend a mile or two, and if it was not for one di&s;agreeable reflexion, would be as plea&s;ant to a foreigner, as a Turk; but when it is con&s;idered, that it is pe&s;tiferated earth we tread on, that every fre&s;h grave may contain a body rotting with the plague, and likewi&s;e the &s;light man|ner in which it is covered with earth, from the hurry it is thrown in, no one can, with prudence, remain for any time among them.</P>
<P>The Turks, who are prede&s;tinarians, and therefore imagine that it is to be fate, and not the precaution taken by Chri&s;tians, which prevents their falling a &s;a|crifice to this fatal di&s;order, walk unconcerned under the dangerous &s;hades of trees that hang over their decea&s;ed neighbour.</P>
<P>It is &s;urpri&s;ing, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> what a va&s;t quantity of land is lo&s;t this way in Turkey. Sometimes I have &s;een burying places of &s;everal miles, belonging to very incon&s;iderable villages, which were formerly great towns, and retain no other mark of their an|cient
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="49">

</FIGURE>
<PB N="49" REF="50">
grandeur, than this di&s;mal one. On no occa|&s;ion do they ever remove a &s;tone that &s;erves for a monument. Some of them are co&s;tly enough, being of very fine marble. They &s;et up a pillar with a carved turban on the top of it, to the memory of a man; and as the turbans by their different &s;hapes, &s;hew the quality or profe&s;&s;ion, it is in a manner putting up the arms of the decea&s;ed. Be&s;ides the pillar com|monly bears an in&s;cription, in golden letters, reciting their virtues. The ladies have a &s;imple pillar, with|out other ornament, except tho&s;e that die unmarried; who have a ro&s;e on the top of their monument. The &s;epulchres of particular families are railed in, and planted round with trees.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of the tombs &s;urrounded by cypre&s;&s;es, and the immen&s;e extent of ground, peaceably occu|pied by the dead, &s;o near to where the living re&s;ide, fills the mind with a kind of gloom, which is often inexpre&s;&s;ibly plea&s;ing. Alas! are we born then to die! And was not <HI>Homer</HI> in the right to compare men to the leaves of the trees! None but the Turki&s;h burial places are allowed to be ornamented with cy|pre&s;&s;es. Tho&s;e of the Jews, Armenians and Greeks, are &s;urrounded with mulberry trees and poplars.</P>
<P>Their tomb-&s;tones are of marble; and thus it is that the fine&s;t marbles of antiquity announce now the remains of &s;ome ob&s;cure individual. I have &s;een,
<PB N="50" REF="51">
&s;ays <HI>Bi&s;ani,</HI> Cadies walking about them melancholy and di&s;con&s;olate; and am told that the Greeks and Armenians are accu&s;tomed to &s;pend their fe&s;tivals among them, after having been to weep there the day before. This cu&s;tom of planting trees round the tombs is very ancient; for we read, even as far back as <HI>Homer,</HI> that <HI>Aelion</HI>'s tomb was adorned with elms.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Commerce, Manufactures, and Coins.</HEAD>
<P>THE Turks carry on very little commerce, be|yond the confines of the Ottoman Empire. One branch of their trade con&s;i&s;ts in their navigation of the Black Sea, with two kinds of ve&s;&s;els, called <HI>Caiques</HI> and <HI>Voligues:</HI> the cargoes of the&s;e differ, according to the parts for which they are de&s;igned. The trade to the coa&s;t of A&s;ia, in the vicinity of the river <HI>Fa&s;ti,</HI> is confined chiefly to wood for fuel, and for building. For the European coa&s;ts, the cargoes con&s;i&s;t of coals; and from more di&s;tant territories, near the Danube, they bring corn, bees-wax, and cattle.</P>
<P>The Crimea abounds in oxen, &s;mall cattle, wax, honey, butter, and corn; all nece&s;&s;ary articles for
<PB N="51" REF="52">
which, there is a con&s;tant demand to &s;upply the mar|ket of Con&s;tantinople, and a con&s;iderable profit is derived from this traffic. But the mo&s;t con&s;iderable branch of trade is that carried on by the Mediter|ranean &s;ea, in a &s;pecies of Turki&s;h ve&s;&s;el, called <HI>Cayrines.</HI> Drugs and coffee are tran&s;ported by the Red Sea, to Suez, and from thence upon camels to Cairo; from Cairo they are forwarded, by the Nile, to Dalmatia, Rou&s;&s;et or Alexandria; and from thence to Con&s;tantinople. The woollen cloths, worn by the common people, are fabricated at Salonica. Fine cloths were formerly manufactured at Con&s;tantinople; but that manufactory is lo&s;t, either through want of &s;kill in the conduct, or, which is more probable, through the intrigues of the French agents. Cam|blets are made in Natolia, a country abounding in fine wool: the rich &s;ilk girdles, and other beautiful &s;ilk manufactures, are wrought at Scio, in the Archi|pelago. The cotton &s;tuffs are manufactured at Alex|andria and Cyprus, and linen cloths in almo&s;t every part of Turkey.</P>
<P>All the i&s;lands of the Archipelago furni&s;h wines. Tinos has its &s;ilk manufactories. Dama&s;cus and Aleppo their &s;oap manufactories, and &s;ilk fabrics; Diarbekir its red morocco. The prices of all the&s;e commodities are regulated by cu&s;tom, and the di&s;|cretion
<PB N="52" REF="53">
of the dealers, who are in general &s;atisfied with &s;mall profit.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee the principal commerce of the Turks con&s;i&s;ts in tran&s;porting the commodities, of the dif|ferent provinces of the empire, either in their natural or improved &s;tate, from one place to another: they are not willing to run any ri&s;k or hazard for greater advantages. In general, they are idle, &s;uper&s;titious, and haughty: idlene&s;s confines them in their &s;hops and warehou&s;es; &s;uper&s;tition and pride prevent their leaving their own country, to travel into others in|habited by infidels, to the hazard of lo&s;ing the Maho|metan faith, and corrupting their pure morals. This is the language of the chief part of the Turks, in other re&s;pects per&s;ons of the highe&s;t reputation for integrity.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the conquered nations, a great many of the Greeks are employed in the commerce of the Black Sea, and there are &s;ome hundreds of Caiques &s;olely belonging to that people. The re&s;t who have not the means of carrying on this branch of traffic, employ them&s;elves in the retail trade, with the foreign merchants e&s;tabli&s;hed at Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>The Armenians, on the contrary, never ri&s;k any thing by &s;ea; and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable trade they
<PB N="53" REF="54">
carry on con&s;i&s;ts in jewels, which they buy rough of the Europeans, and fa&s;hion to the Ea&s;tern ta&s;te; a traffic that produces them very con&s;iderable advan|tages. The Jews do not engage in navigation them|&s;elves, but ri&s;k great capitals, carrying on &s;ome com|merce with all the nations of Europe. Many of them are phy&s;icians, and exerci&s;e their function by permi&s;&s;ion of the phy&s;ician of the Grand Signor, who is almo&s;t the only con&s;tituent of the Univer&s;ity of Con&s;tantinople; and on whom all tho&s;e who exerci&s;e the medical &s;kill depend, except the European phy|&s;icians. A great number of Jews are brokers for all kinds of merchandi&s;e. The Per&s;ians formerly carried on a very great traffic at Con&s;tantinople, but that trade is now very much on the decline.</P>
<P>The trade from England to Turkey is carried on by a limited number of Engli&s;h merchants, dependent on the Turkey company of London, who con&s;ign to them, by a &s;ingle annual convoy, &s;uch articles of com|merce as they judge may be ea&s;ily &s;old or exchanged: the quantity is always in proportion to the wants of Turkey, and they take particular care never to over-&s;tock the market. This precaution prevents their experiencing any lo&s;s from a glut of merchan|di&s;e, and &s;upports that great repute which the mer|chandi&s;e from England has always enjoyed. The chief articles of their trade are lead, tin, watches;
<PB N="54" REF="55">
all kinds of clock-work, hard ware, woollen cloths, &s;pice and china. The attention of tho&s;e per&s;ons, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> who are deputed as factors for this trade in Turkey, and who carry it on with an exact ob&s;ervance of the rules and laws which they are to go by, is worthy of imitation. Further, it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of articles of great value, the &s;ale of which is certain. This is the rea&s;on that all the Engli&s;h hou&s;es e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in Turkey are rich. An Engli&s;h merchant who died lately at Pera, (Mr. <HI>Parker</HI>) left immen&s;e riches to his heirs. His country &s;eat alone was va|lued at 400 pur&s;es, (each pur&s;e &pound; 108. 6<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI>) by the Captain Ba&s;haw, who de&s;ired to purcha&s;e it. At Con&s;tantinople there is no merchandi&s;e to load back to England: the &s;hips are in general obliged to take in their loading at Smyrna, which con&s;i&s;ts in raw cot|ton, wool, Bur&s;a &s;ilk, and a great deal of Angora hair for camblets. The caravans which u&s;ed to come from Per&s;ia to Smyrna, with great quantities of &s;ilk, have cea&s;ed coming, &s;ince the Ru&s;&s;ians have been al|lowed a free navigation on the Ca&s;pian Sea; from whence they tran&s;port this &s;ilk to A&s;tracan, and from thence it goes to Peter&s;burgh. This is the rea&s;on that the Engli&s;h, at pre&s;ent, very frequently fall &s;hort in their cargoes homeward, both at Smyrna and Aleppo.</P>
<P>The Dutch trade is very much on the decline to what it u&s;ed to be; and that which they have now in any
<PB N="55" REF="56">
of the ports of the Levant, is but very trifling. The private intere&s;t of individuals, has ruined the Dutch trade in Turkey; which, though formerly very flou|ri&s;hing, is now nearly annihilated.</P>
<P>The commerce which the Ru&s;&s;ians carry on at Con&s;tantinople, and other parts of Turkey, though but little noticed, is by far the mo&s;t advantageous, and con&s;iderable, of the European nations; it con|&s;i&s;ts principally of &s;kins of every kind, to make Turki&s;h pelli&s;&s;es. All kinds of people, of every age, and &s;ex, wear pelli&s;&s;es in Turkey. The &s;ale which the Ru&s;&s;ians have in them is incredible; and &s;ome bear very high prices. Black fox and ermine &s;kins are more e&s;teemed than any of the re&s;t; and a &s;mall quantity of the&s;e two &s;pecies of furs, amounts to a very large capital. The Ru&s;&s;ians take nothing in return but Morocco leather, oranges, lemon juice, and dried fruits. It is on the Black Sea that this trade is carried on; and as by the la&s;t treaty of peace the Ru&s;&s;ians have permi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s in|to the Mediterranean, they go to the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, in order to load back with wine, and the other products of tho&s;e i&s;lands. No other nation whatever has been able to obtain the per|mi&s;&s;ion of the Porte, to trade upon the Black Sea; though the Court of France has made repeated ef|forts for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57">The Germans have for a long time been endea|vouring to e&s;tabli&s;h a trade with the Turks, which might be accompli&s;hed three ways; by land, by the Danube, or from Trie&s;t, down the Adriatic. Tho&s;e articles, however, with which they could trade to any advantage, are of great weight or bulk, and con&s;e|quently mu&s;t incur larger expences in the freight; be&s;ides being already imported by other nations into Turkey in great abundance, as iron, cotton, &s;teel, &amp;c. &amp;c. and from the quality of the&s;e merchandi&s;es it may be deduced, that their trade with the Turks will ever be of little importance.</P>
<P>It is but very lately that the Swedes and Neapoli|tans have &s;ent mini&s;ters to the Porte, in the charac|ters of Envoys extraordinary, with a view to e&s;tabli&s;h a commercial intercour&s;e with Turkey. The Swedes have ju&s;t made a beginning by &s;ea. A &s;ingle &s;hip arrives every year at Con&s;tantinople, laden with iron, and &s;ome other trifling products of the barren &s;oil of Sweden. But there are a great number of Swedi&s;h ve&s;&s;els employed in tran&s;porting the Turki&s;h merchandi&s;e to different parts of the Ottoman Em|pire; and particularly to the coa&s;t of Barbary, from whence a very con&s;iderable profit is derived; though the Swedes, who navigate the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, are to be con&s;idered as carriers, rather than mer|chants.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">The Neapolitans carry to Turkey, a &s;pecies of &s;ilk &s;tuff worked at Me&s;&s;ina, and by the Turks called Zebins; for which there is a great demand, on ac|count of their beautiful appearance, though they are very &s;light, and quickly change colour. The returns are &s;mall, and of little con&s;equence; the ballance, therefore, is in their favour.</P>
<P>But the riche&s;t, and by far the mo&s;t regular of all the European commerce e&s;tabli&s;hed in Turkey, is that of the French. The value of their commerce with the Turks is e&s;timated to exceed twenty millions of Turki&s;h pia&s;tres a year; which, admitting a Turki&s;h pia&s;tre to be equal to four &s;hillings, makes above four millions &s;terling, annually. The principal article of their commerce is cloth, of which they &s;end out three &s;orts, all very acceptable to the Turks, the price being always lower than that of Engli&s;h cloths; the colours al&s;o are more lively and durable.</P>
<P>This commerce is carried on by French merchants e&s;tabli&s;hed even in the very villages of Turkey; they depend, however, on the chamber of commerce at Mar&s;eilles, and can remain only a limited time, after which they mu&s;t return to France; and give up their bu&s;ine&s;s to others. No individual among the&s;e mer|chants can di&s;po&s;e of his cloths without the prior knowledge, and permi&s;&s;ion of his amba&s;&s;ador or con|&s;ul,
<PB N="58" REF="59">
becau&s;e the &s;ale mu&s;t be made in equal propor|tion among them, by the&s;e means all underminings and deceptions are prevented, that might &s;ap the foundation of &s;o valuable a branch of trade.</P>
<P>There is a general bank for the whole French nation, e&s;tabli&s;hed in every &s;ea-port of the Levant, to which all the French merchants who re&s;ide in Turkey pay a certain tax, in proportion to the cloth they &s;ell, and which is no great burthen upon them, con&s;idering their great profits. From the funds of the&s;e banks many advantages ari&s;e, among others, that of in&s;uring the capitals of the merchants in France; becau&s;e, in ca&s;es of bankruptcy, part of their lo&s;s is refunded to them, from the common &s;tock. It likewi&s;e defrays the extraordinary expences of the nation, for the hotels of the French amba&s;|&s;ador or con&s;ul, in Turkey, and for the maintenance of many poor families there. By this in&s;titution, the economical admini&s;tration finds its account there, and the nation its intere&s;t, tranquility and honor. The French likewi&s;e derive another advantage which con&s;i&s;ts in tran&s;porting merchandi&s;e, on account of the Turks, from one &s;ea-port to another. And, in every little &s;ea-port and &s;mall town, the French have a con&s;ul, or vice-con&s;ul, to promote and protect their commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60">Baron <HI>de Tott,</HI> who was &s;ent a few years &s;ince, by the French mini&s;try, to the Levant, as In&s;pector Ge|neral of the French commerce in Turkey, made &s;everal alterations in the&s;e particulars. This Baron <HI>de Tott,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> was as much in the intere&s;t of the Turks as of his own country, and, con&s;equently, was well paid by both parties. He pa&s;&s;ed for a man of great abilities, but, adds <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> I had the oppor|tunity of &s;tudying his character, during three months, at Smyrna. Being employed to in&s;pect the com|merce of that &s;ea-port, his time was more deeply engaged in paying his court to a Greek lady, who was married to a very unfortunate, but very hone&s;t, Frenchman; and this lady made the Baron commit a number of follies very unworthy of an In&s;pector General. The French con&s;ul at Smyrna, M. <HI>Pey|&s;onnel,</HI> who&s;e remarks on the Turks we have already frequently had occa&s;ion to introduce, and which ap|pear to carry with them great di&s;cernment and can|dour, &s;eems to have fallen the victim of Baron <HI>de Tott</HI>'s endeavours to plea&s;e this lady; M. <HI>Pey&s;onnel,</HI> adds <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> merited rather to fill the place of the Baron, than to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by one &s;o much his in|ferior in abilities. Good luck, and certain other circum&s;tances, of which he is not ignorant, occa&s;ioned his promotion. In France, &s;uch promotions are common, as well as in other countries where their manners are adopted.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61">The Venetians were, formerly, the riche&s;t European Merchants e&s;tabli&s;hed in Turkey. But other nations have &s;ince turned to their advantage the di&s;graces and lo&s;&s;es which fell upon them by their frequent wars with the Porte. The manufactures which have been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in different parts of Europe, have likewi&s;e been of great prejudice to them; but what injured their commerce mo&s;t materially, as well with the Turki&s;h as with other &s;tates, was the navigation of the Dutch, and other powers, to the Ea&s;t Indies, by the Cape of Good Hope. At pre&s;ent, their commerce with the Turks is confined to a &s;mall quantity of gold &s;tuffs, and a &s;pecies of dama&s;k called <HI>Dama&s;quetti,</HI> which is worn by almo&s;t every family in Turkey.</P>
<P>There is no doubt that the commerce of the Eu|ropeans with Turkey is &s;o very di&s;advantageous to Turks, as to be one cau&s;e of the decline of the em|pire. The merchandi&s;e carried into Turkey is very valuable, and what is exported not the lea&s;t &s;o. The merchants, therefore, e&s;tabli&s;hed in Turkey, having no articles of commerce to export, equal in value to what is imported into the country, are obliged to make their returns in gold, money and diamonds, and by the&s;e means the country is impoveri&s;hed. The mo&s;t valuable Turki&s;h coin is the <HI>Foncli</HI> ducat, of very fine gold, equal in value with the Venetian ducat. Four or five millions of the&s;e
<PB N="61" REF="62">
ducats, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> are &s;ent every year out of the kingdom. One may judge, therefore, how many millions of the&s;e pieces of gold mu&s;t have gone out of the country for the&s;e two la&s;t centuries. There is no law to prohibit the exportation of &s;pecie from the Turki&s;h dominions. The eunuchs, the vizier, the great officers of &s;tate, and even the Grand Sig|nor him&s;elf, all contribute to ruin the empire; for they are fond of accumulating great riches; they are continually receiving money, and &s;carcely ever parting with it again: it follows then that the&s;e great &s;ums, which are &s;o hoarded up, mu&s;t con|&s;iderably impede the circulation of money in Tur|key.</P>
<P>The tyranny of their government de&s;troys that happy &s;ecurity, which is the mother of arts, indu&s;try and commerce; and &s;uch is the deba&s;ement of the human mind, when borne down by hard&s;hips and op|pre&s;&s;ion, that all the great advantages of commerce, which nature has as it were thrown under the feet of the inhabitants of this country, are neglected. The Turks command the navigation of the Red Sea, which opens a communication with all the riches of the Indies. Their capital is &s;eated on a neck of land that &s;eparates Europe from A&s;ia, and communicates on the South with the Mediterranean &s;ea; which opens a pa&s;&s;age to all the European nations, as well
<PB N="62" REF="63">
as to the coa&s;t of Africa. The &s;ame &s;trait commu|nicating northwards with the Black Sea, opens a pa&s;|&s;age, by means of the Danube and other rivers, into the interior parts of Germany, Poland and Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>Yet, in this exten&s;ive empire, with all the&s;e advan|tages for a foreign commerce, and where all the com|modities, nece&s;&s;ary for manufactures of every kind, are produced; the Turks content them&s;elves with working up, on a very confined &s;cale, the few trifling articles of cottons, carpets, leather and &s;oap. The mo&s;t valuable of their commodities, &s;uch as &s;ilk, a variety of drugs, and dying &s;tuffs, they generally ex|port raw, and unmanufactured.</P>
<P>It appears from <HI>Pey&s;onnel</HI>'s &s;trictures on Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> that Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> errs in &s;uppo&s;ing Con&s;tan|tinople to be a free port. The duties indeed are very low, which makes it next to a free port; being not more, according to <HI>Pey&s;onnel,</HI> then two per cent, and all merchandi&s;e is be&s;ides e&s;timated much inferior to its real value. It is to be ob&s;erved further, adds Mr. <HI>P.</HI> that this duty once paid, every European merchant provided with a <HI>Ta&s;ham,</HI> or quittance from the officer, may convey his goods to any part of the empire, without paying any thing more. No extor|tions are practi&s;ed in the cu&s;toms, on account of the Tariff, and di&s;putes with the officers are very rare.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64">We &s;hould not omit to mention the lenity with which the laws in Turkey, treat tho&s;e who deal in contraband commodities. When any &s;uch goods are &s;eized and carried to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, the pro|prietor may claim them again, on paying double duty.</P>
<P>The Turks &s;eem likewi&s;e to have &s;hewn great genero&s;ity to the French merchants, at a time when the plague made great ravage in the capital, in &s;uf|fering their merchandi&s;e to be immediately conveyed to the magazines, without undergoing any examina|tion, accepting the cu&s;toms according to their own declaration. Of this very honourable genero&s;ity, &s;ome of the French merchants had the meanne&s;s to take advantages, notwith&s;tanding the menaces of their amba&s;&s;ador, by daring to give in unju&s;t accounts to the chief commi&s;&s;ioner of the cu&s;toms, who, though he had too much &s;en&s;e to di&s;cover the fraud, di&s;dained to make any complaint. We are happy in &s;eeing no charge of this kind made again&s;t our own nation.</P>
<P>The Turks can never make any great progre&s;s in the fine arts, while they adhere to the dictates of their religion, as the laws of Mahomet forbid their &s;ketching the human figure in any &s;hape. They paint flowers, however, and other ornamental figures, to
<PB N="64" REF="65">
admiration. There are al&s;o &s;hops in Con&s;tantinople, where they engrave cornelians, and other &s;orts of &s;tones: the Turks have, likewi&s;e, an art of poli&s;h|ing their horn, &s;o as to make it look like tortoi&s;e-&s;hell, and this they manufacture into &s;poons, it being contrary to the precepts of their alcoran, as we have before ob&s;erved, to make u&s;e of &s;ilver ones. Their &s;abres are al&s;o in very great e&s;teem all over Europe; the temper of their &s;teel, in all articles of their cutlery, being &s;uperior to that of all other countries. Another principal manufacture which they have unrivalled, in point of excellence, is their Morocco, or Turkey leather. Their embroideries, in gold and &s;ilver, on this leather, are worked with great ta&s;te and elegance. They particularly excel in their pocket-books, which are embroidered all round the edges in a very &s;uperb manner. There are in Galata, a great number of &s;hops which deal only in this article, &s;o much are they in e&s;teem by all foreigners who re&s;ort to Turkey. To tho&s;e arts and manufactures, on which the Turks deign to be&s;tow any time or attention, like the an|cient Greeks, from whom they are &s;aid to have de&s;cended, they infinitely &s;urpa&s;s all other nations in the beauty, &s;kill, and excellencies of their work|man&s;hip.</P>
<P>The gold and large &s;ilver coin, of all countries, is current in Turkey. The proper coins of the coun|try
<PB N="65" REF="66">
are, fir&s;t, tho&s;e of gold; namely, the <HI>altines,</HI> or ducats, which are about &s;even &s;hillings each, and the zechinos, worth about nine &s;hillings. Secondly, of the &s;ilver, the zeloti is worth about two &s;hillings and two-pence farthing; the krip nearly a &s;hilling; the gro&s;h is worth about three-pence; the para worth about three a&s;pers, and the a&s;pers, (&s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI>) about one penny half-penny. <HI>Tott</HI> calculates them at not more than a farthing. A pur&s;e contains five hundred rix-dollars, or one hundred and eight pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence. In their com|merce, they reckon by pia&s;tres, as we do by pounds &s;terling. A pia&s;tre, in Turkey, is equivalent to four &s;hillings Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The &s;ilver coin, in Turkey, u&s;ed formerly to be at &s;uch a very high &s;tandard, that the remittance of it to Europe, was found more advantageous than any other article of exportation from the Le|vant. A French merchant having &s;atisfied him&s;elf, by an a&s;&s;ay, of the ju&s;tne&s;s of this &s;peculation, con|verted the produce of all the merchandi&s;e he had &s;old into pia&s;tres and zelottes, which he melted down, and remitting the &s;ilver to France, found the profits fully an&s;wer his expectation. His &s;ucce&s;s encouraged him to continue this practice, and he might have made an immen&s;e fortune by it, had he not divulged his &s;ecret, but not being able to re&s;i&s;t the vanity of
<PB N="66" REF="67">
boa&s;ting of his lucky thought, others, taking the hint, pre&s;ently imitated him. Their example was &s;oon fol|lowed by all the French and foreign merchants, not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tantinople, but in all the &s;ea-ports of the Levant; and this de&s;truction of the &s;ilver coin, &s;o eagerly practi&s;ed by the European merchants, who traded to Turkey, dimini&s;hed the currency to &s;uch a degree, that the Porte perceived it, and found out the cau&s;e. The Ottoman mini&s;ters then re&s;olved to reduce the coin to &s;o low a &s;tandard, that no per&s;on was afterwards tempted, either to melt it down, or to &s;end it abroad.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of their Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THE Turks are of the Mahometan religion, and appropriate to them&s;elves the name of <HI>Mo&s;lemin,</HI> which has been &s;trangely corrupted into <HI>Mu&s;elman,</HI> &s;ignifying per&s;ons profe&s;&s;ing the doctrine and pre|cepts of <HI>Mahammed.</HI> A great difference of opinion prevails among the Mahometan doctors, with re|&s;pect to the interpretation of the&s;e precepts; Maho|meti&s;m is divided into as many &s;ects as Chri&s;tianity; and its fir&s;t in&s;titution as much neglected and ob|&s;cured
<PB N="67" REF="68">
by interpretations. But none are &s;o oppo&s;ite and contrary to each other, as the comments of <HI>Omar</HI> and <HI>Ali,</HI> who in fact, in&s;tituted two religions, the followers of which became bitter enemies to each other. The Turks in general have adopted the ex|planation of <HI>Omar,</HI> and the Per&s;ians that of <HI>Ali.</HI> The creed of <HI>Omar</HI> being then the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the Ottoman Empire, we &s;hall confine our&s;elves here to that alone.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t article of their faith is, that there is but one God, and that <HI>Mahomet</HI> is his prophet; no Turk mu&s;t expect eternal &s;alvation, unle&s;s he firmly adheres to this doctrine. There are al&s;o five pre|cepts of practical duty enjoined to con&s;titute a good Mu&s;elman, which are called the fundamentals of their religion. The fir&s;t is ablution; the &s;econd prayer, which mu&s;t be performed five times every day; the third, is the ob&s;ervation of the fa&s;t of Ramadan, or Ramazan; the fourth, is to give alms indi&s;crimi|nately, and la&s;tly, to perform, at lea&s;t once in their lives, the pilgrimage to Mecca.</P>
<P>To the&s;e principal and e&s;&s;ential articles, a great number of others are added of an inferior obliga|tion; &s;uch as ab&s;taining from pork and wine, keep|ing Friday holy, as we do Sunday in our church, and in being circumci&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69">Ablution is the fir&s;t of their indi&s;pen&s;able duties. It is divided into three di&s;tinct &s;pecies. The fir&s;t is that performed preparatory to entering a Mo&s;que, or before prayers. The manner of performing it is this.&mdash;They begin with wa&s;hing both hands, re|peating at the &s;ame time, the&s;e words&mdash;"Prai&s;ed be God who has created clean water, and has given it the virtue to purify us, and render our faith illu&s;|trious." After this, they take &s;ome water in their right hand three times, and wa&s;h their mouths, &s;ay|ing,&mdash;"I pray thee, O Lord, to let me ta&s;te of that water which thou ha&s;t given to thy prophet in Pa|radi&s;e&mdash;more odoriferous than mu&s;k&mdash;whiter than milk&mdash;&s;weeter than honey, and which has the power to quench, for ever, the thir&s;t of him who drinks of it." This done, they &s;nuff a little water up the no&s;|trils, and &s;ay, "Grant, O Lord, that I may &s;mell the &s;weet odours of Paradi&s;e, and enjoy them, and &s;uffer me not to breathe tho&s;e of hell." Then they wa&s;h their faces, three times, all round, and behind their ears, &s;aying, "Make clean my face, O Lord, and that of tho&s;e who obey thee; that they may re&s;emble thy prophets in the day of judgment." Water is then taken with the right hand, and thrown up to the elbow three times, repeating, "Give me, O Lord, at the la&s;t day, the book of my good works into my right hand, and pardon my offences." The &s;ame operation being performed with the left hand, during the repe|tition
<PB N="69" REF="70">
of a &s;imilar &s;entence. The crown of the head is then wa&s;hed, repeating, "Let thy mercy &s;urround me, O Lord, when I &s;hall appear before thee." Water is now taken up with both hands, and the orifice of the ears wa&s;hed with the thumbs, repeat|ing, "Make me, O Lord, one of tho&s;e thy &s;er|vants, who hearken to what is written in the &s;acred books, and obey thy commandments." Finally, with all the fingers they wa&s;h the neck, &s;aying, "Deliver me, O Lord God, from hell, and from the chains put round the neck and feet of &s;inners." The feet of cour&s;e are wa&s;hed during this ejaculation, but it is &s;ufficient to be done externally over the &s;andals, or &s;hort boots which they wear, and the ceremony fi|ni&s;hes with, "Hold me up firmly, O Lord, and &s;uffer not my feet to &s;lip, le&s;t I fall over the bridge into hell." The Turks believe there is a bridge to pa&s;s over, in order to get to paradi&s;e, as narrow as the edge of a knife, and that hell lies under this bridge. The prayer which concludes this general ablution is, "Accept my prayers, O Lord, pardon my &s;ins, re|ceive the offerings I have made, and do not permit the prayers I have &s;aid, to be fruitle&s;s."</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;pecies of ablution is u&s;ed with the warm bath when they ri&s;e in the morning, after they have pa&s;&s;ed the night in their Harams.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">The third con&s;i&s;ts in ablutions after ea&s;ing the ne|ce&s;&s;ities of nature; &s;ome are even &s;o &s;crupulous to perform this ceremony after breaking wind.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to public prayers, as the alcoran or|ders them to be &s;aid five times in the &s;pace of twen|ty-four hours, the fir&s;t begins at day-break,&mdash;the &s;e|cond at noon,&mdash;the third, exactly between noon and the &s;etting &s;un,&mdash;the fourth, immediately after &s;un &s;et,&mdash;and the fifth, an hour and a half afterwards. Each mo&s;que having turrets, per&s;ons appointed for that purpo&s;e, as hath before been remarked, a&s;cend them, and cry out with a loud and intelligible voice at each &s;tated time, that it is the hour of prayers. The ve|neration, attention, and true &s;pirit of devotion, with which the Turks perform their prayers, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, is highly prai&s;e-worthy. Nothing is capable of diverting their attention, which is carried to &s;uch a &s;uper&s;titious extreme, that if they happen to cough, or &s;neeze, they begin all their prayers again, and go over them with the greate&s;t patience, as often as &s;uch an accident happens. The different po&s;itions of their bodies, and their contortions, whil&s;t praying, are numberle&s;s. They will extend their arms, place their hands upon their ears, bend their bodies, kneel, pro&s;trate them&s;elves, and &s;ometimes put their foreheads to the ground, like the Indians and Chine&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="72">The Turks, &s;ays <HI>Le Brun,</HI> very &s;eldom mi&s;s the&s;e five hours of prayer, but e&s;pecially the fir&s;t, and the la&s;t two; for &s;hould it be di&s;covered, that out of the five times enjoined them for prayers, they do not perform them, at lea&s;t three times, they would be &s;everely puni&s;hed. Nor is there any di&s;pen&s;ation that will avail them in this particular. If they cannot go to the mo&s;que, they are obliged to &s;ay their prayers wherever they are, and even when on a journey, they mu&s;t allight from their hor&s;es at the &s;tated hours of prayer. If they are travelling in company with a caravan, the ma&s;ter of it makes a halt, and turn|ing towards Mecca, either calls out him&s;elf, or or|ders &s;ome other per&s;on to give notice, that it is the hour of prayer, upon which, all the Turks allight, and begin their prayers. Chri&s;tians who are with the caravan, are permitted to keep on their hor&s;es, but they are not allowed to go forward, till the others have fini&s;hed their prayers; unle&s;s they are the more numerous party, for in that ca&s;e, the Turks them&s;elves turn out of the road to pray.</P>
<P>The third article of a Mu&s;elman's faith, is an ob|&s;ervance of the fa&s;t of Ramazan, &s;o called from the name of a lunar month. From break of day, whil&s;t this month la&s;ts, the Turks neither eat, drink, &s;moke, or &s;mell any odour; in &s;hort, they do no|thing to admini&s;ter plea&s;ure to the five &s;en&s;es till &s;un|&s;et.
<PB N="72" REF="73">
Such is the law, and tho&s;e who tran&s;gre&s;s it, are puni&s;hed very &s;everely; even with death, if the of|fence has cau&s;ed &s;candal. Formerly, in the height of their religious zeal, the violaters of the fa&s;t of Ramazan, had melted lead poured down their throats; at pre&s;ent, either the Turks are more &s;trict, or the zeal of their &s;uperiors is abated; for this bar|barous puni&s;hment is no longer heard of. But it may be ea&s;ily conceived, that the night is turned into day, during the Ramazan, for the Turks are of too indolent a di&s;po&s;ition to work when they do not eat, &s;o that they &s;leep through mo&s;t of the day. It is &s;aid, in the alcoran, that during this month, they may eat, and drink, all night long, till they can di&s;|cern a white thread from a black, by the morning light.</P>
<P>The fourth article of their creed, obliges them to give the tenth part of their income to the poor. But this precept is not &s;o well ob&s;erved as the former, by tho&s;e who have con&s;iderable revenues; and this is one rea&s;on, among others, why the opulent Turks endeavour to conceal their riches from the public.</P>
<P>The fifth, and la&s;t article, is the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is held to be of &s;uch importance, that he, who from, bad health or, the &s;tate of his affairs,
<PB N="73" REF="74">
cannot undertake it, though the law may exempt him, thinks him&s;elf very unfortunate.</P>
<P>The pilgrims for Mecca, &s;et out from Con&s;tanti|nople in the month of May, and repair to Dama&s;cus, where they join the other pilgrims, from Natolia and A&s;ia. Afterwards, they unite with tho&s;e that come from Per&s;ia, Egypt, and other parts of the Ottoman Empire. The whole number commonly amounts to &s;ixty thou&s;and; though Sir <HI>James Porter</HI> makes their number amount to two hundred thou|&s;and; but this is a great error, and mu&s;t mean to in|clude all the trading, and other travellers, who either for &s;afety, or convenience, travel with the caravan; yet, reckoning the&s;e with the &s;uttlers and &s;laves, the whole will not amount to this enormous number. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from Mecca, there is a mountain on which the pilgrims offer up &s;acrifices to God, in ho|nour of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> by &s;acrificing &s;ome &s;heep upon altars, the fle&s;h of which is given to the poor. The day after the &s;acrifice, the pilgrims, before they a&s;cend the mountain again, &s;trip off their u&s;ual cloathing, and put on the coar&s;e&s;t dre&s;s that can be conceived; to &s;hew they renounce the pomp and va|nities of the world, and a&s;pire only to paradi&s;e. They are obliged to walk round the out&s;ide of the temple &s;even times; and then going out of the city, by the gate they entered, every one takes up a &s;tone,
<PB N="74" REF="75">
and &s;lings it to a certain di&s;tance, to denote his contempt for all other religions. In the temple of Mecca, they ki&s;s the black &s;tone, which fell from heaven, to point out the &s;pot on which the Temple &s;hould be built: it was originally white, they tell you, but being re|peatedly polluted by the lips of &s;inners, it has long &s;ince been changed to a jet black. Its virtue con&s;i&s;ts in ab&s;olving tho&s;e who ki&s;s it with devout faith, from all their &s;ins.</P>
<P>The temple of Mecca is magnificent and rich; in the centre, is the tomb of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which the com|mon people believe to be &s;u&s;pended in the air. The Grand Signor &s;ends every year, to this temple, five hundred Venetian ducats, an alcoran bound in gold, and a rich gold embroidered &s;tuff, to cover the tomb of the prophet. When the new covering is put on, the old one is cut into &s;mall pieces, and delivered to the faithful, who pre&s;erve it with the greate&s;t vene|ration.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Pey&s;onnel,</HI> the Sultan &s;ends two co|verings, one to Mecca, and the other to Medina, together with the other royal offerings, de&s;igned for tho&s;e holy places. The&s;e are carried by the <HI>Surra Emini,</HI> or Intendant of Alms, who is likewi&s;e to take charge of the money ari&s;ing from legacies be|queathed by individuals. The fir&s;t covering, is in|tended
<PB N="75" REF="76">
for the <HI>Beith Oullah,</HI> or hou&s;e of God, at Mecca, which is the grand object of the pilgrimage, and is commonly called, the <HI>Kiaba,</HI> or Cube, be|cau&s;e its form is a perfect cube. This covering is a black woolen &s;tuff without any ornament. The <HI>Sur|ra Emini,</HI> who carries the new one, brings back the old, and pre&s;ents it to the Emperor, who di&s;tri|butes the pieces of it to the grandees, and his fa|vourites. The&s;e pieces are held in the highe&s;t ve|neration, and tho&s;e who obtain them, give orders, that at their burial, their heads &s;hall be covered with them in the coffin; and care is taken to let the&s;e pre|cious fragments appear on the out&s;ide, over the rich &s;tuff which covers the bier, in the funerals of the great. The &s;econd covering is of &s;ilk and gold, and is carried to Medina, to the tomb which it is de&s;igned to envelop.</P>
<P>Devotions being ended, the pilgrims return to Dama&s;cus, in the &s;ame order they arrived. Many of the&s;e pilgrims make repeated journies to Mecca, not for devotion, but to purcha&s;e merchandi&s;e, which is there to be bought very cheap. And as it is per|mitted for any one, who cannot perform the pilgri|mage in per&s;on, to &s;end a deputy; there are others who make a traffic of the&s;e pious deputations. They are maintained, and fed by tho&s;e who &s;end them, for whom they perform the cu&s;tomary prayers and
<PB N="76" REF="77">
&s;acrifices; the&s;e people generally take great care to conceal the name and quality of their employers, by which &s;tratagem, one deputy will obtain a great num|ber of the&s;e devout commi&s;&s;ions. In &s;hort, it is a profe&s;&s;ion that affords a very comfortable livelihood.</P>
<P>The caravans of pilgrims to Mecca, u&s;ed to be held &s;acred by the Arabs, and even by common robbers. However, a few years &s;ince, the caravan, from Per&s;ia to Mecca, was attacked. It was cu&s;|tomary for the caravan to take conductors from a particular tribe of Arabs, encamped in the environs of Ba&s;&s;ora, who&s;e chief received a certain &s;um for protecting the caravan to Dama&s;cus, and this tribe was one of the mo&s;t powerful among the Arabs. It happened, in the year 1776, that in the caravan, from Ba&s;&s;ora to Dama&s;cus, there was the daughter of <HI>Kerim Kan,</HI> a powerful Per&s;ian prince, accompanied by a train of ladies, all very rich. The chief of the tribe, ob&s;erving the great &s;plendour and riches of this caravan, and the quality of the pilgrims, demanded a more con&s;iderable &s;um than u&s;ual to protect them, which they refu&s;ed to pay; and addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to the chief of another tribe, who agreed to protect them for the &s;ame &s;um they had formerly paid. The caravan accordingly &s;et out from Ba&s;&s;ora, but when it had reached the heart of the de&s;art through which it was obliged to pa&s;s; the chief of the fir&s;t tribe, with
<PB N="77" REF="78">
his followers, &s;uddenly fell upon the Arabs who guarded it, of whom they made great &s;laughter; the pilgrims were then all &s;tripped, the daughter of <HI>Kerim Kan</HI> not excepted, and after having plundered the caravan, the travellers were afterwards left to pur&s;ue their journey to Dama&s;cus, where they arrived in a mo&s;t wretched plight. I &s;aw one of the company, a merchant, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> who, but a few days before, was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of five hundred thou&s;and pia&s;tres, which is between twenty and thirty thou&s;and pounds, reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;king charity. This ad|venture made the fortune of a Frenchman who re|&s;ided at Tripoly, in Syria; for the prince&s;s being unable to borrow money from the Turks, from their enmity to the Per&s;ians; the Frenchman generou&s;ly offered her his pur&s;e, which &s;he accepted; and when &s;he returned home, <HI>Kerim Kan</HI> remitted him, not only the original &s;um he had advanced, but double intere&s;t, and &s;uch magnificent pre&s;ents, that the French merchant was enriched for the remainder of his life.</P>
<P><HI>Kerim Kan</HI> &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the Porte, to com|plain of this daring outrage, and demand &s;atisfac|tion; it being the duty of the Grand Signor to pro|vide for the &s;afety of the caravans that go to Mecca, while they are upon his territories; but the Porte only gave eva&s;ive an&s;wers, and alledged, that the
<PB N="78" REF="79">
Arabs were rebels, and that the tribe who had com|mitted this outrage, inhabited the territory of Ba&s;|&s;ora, which was &s;ubject to the government of Bagdat, it therefore belonged to the Ba&s;haw of that city to indemnify him. <HI>Kerim Kan,</HI> enraged at this an&s;wer, marched his troops to Ba&s;&s;ora, which he took, and plundered; the riches he ama&s;&s;ed, by this expedi|tion, were immen&s;e; and not being &s;atisfied, he di|rected his cour&s;e to Bagdat, which he likewi&s;e be|&s;ieged, and kept blocked up &s;ix months; when the Grand Signor agreed to give him ample &s;atisfaction, and a peace was concluded. I was at Con&s;tanti|nople, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> when the Amba&s;&s;ador from <HI>Kerim Kan</HI> arrived, and ob&s;erved, he had audience of the Grand Signor, without lo&s;s of time.&mdash;To re|turn to the religious tenets of the Turks, it remains only to remark, that circumci&s;ion is not enjoined by the alcoran, but is only a ceremony which the Turks perform as an ancient cu&s;tom, derived from their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the precepts, which forbid the drink|ing of wine, and eating of pork, I can take upon me to affirm, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> that they have only a nominal exi&s;t|ence. Friday, which &s;hould be con&s;idered as a day of particular devotion, is now converted into a day of recreation. And it is, on this day, that the public hou&s;es of entertainment are filled with Turks, who
<PB N="79" REF="80">
eat and drink to exce&s;s, of every thing that is for|bidden. The Turks, at Con&s;tantinople, adds the &s;ame author, drink more wine than is con&s;umed at Paris, and the importation of this article alone, yields a larger revenue, than any other branch of commerce whatever.</P>
<P>We &s;carce know how to credit this a&s;&s;ertion, that wine is not prohibited by the alcoran. Lady <HI>M.</HI> in her remarks on the religion of the Turks, begins with ob&s;erving, "tis certain, we have but very imper|fect accounts of the manners, and religion of this people. This part of the world being &s;eldom vi&s;ited but by merchants, who mind little but their own af|fairs; or travellers, who make too &s;hort a &s;tay, to be able to report any thing exactly of their own know|ledge. The Turks are too proud to conver&s;e fami|liarly with merchants, who can give no better ac|count of their ways here, than a French refugee, liv|ing in a garret in Grub-&s;treet, can of the court of England. I had the advantage, &s;he adds, of lodg|ing three weeks, at Belgrade, with a principal Ef|fendi, that is to &s;ay, a &s;cholar, and an intimate daily conver&s;ation with him, gave me an opportunity of knowing their religion, and morals, in a more particular manner, than perhaps any Chri&s;tian ever did. This man, &s;he &s;ays, made no &s;cruple of de|viating from &s;ome part of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s law, by drink|ing
<PB N="80" REF="81">
wine with the &s;ame freedom we did. When I a&s;ked him how he came to allow him&s;elf this liberty; he made an&s;wer, that all the creatures of God are good, and de&s;igned for the u&s;e of man; however, that the prohibition of wine was a very wi&s;e maxim, and meant for the common people, being the &s;ource of all di&s;orders among&s;t them; but that the Prophet never de&s;igned to confine tho&s;e who knew how to u&s;e it with moderation; neverthele&s;s, he &s;aid, that &s;candal ought to be avoided, and that he never drank it in public. This is the general way of thinking among&s;t them, and very few forbear drinking wine, that are able to afford it."</P>
<P>It appears therefore, from this extract, taken from Lady <HI>M.</HI> that wine is prohibited by the Turki&s;h law; notwith&s;tanding its being drunk to &s;uch exce&s;s, as af|firmed by the former writer.</P>
<P><HI>Le Brun</HI> likewi&s;e gives the rea&s;on why it was pro|hibited; that <HI>Mahomet,</HI> in pa&s;&s;ing through a village, ob&s;erved great rejoicing at a wedding, and that wine was the occa&s;ion of the mirth, which made him drink it very copiou&s;ly. But that returning back, the next day, by the &s;ame road, he &s;aw the marks of a great deal of blood having been &s;pilt; and con|jecturing that tho&s;e per&s;ons, whom he had &s;een &s;o convivial together the day before, had fallen out
<PB N="81" REF="82">
and wounded each other, he forbid the free u&s;e of wine, and recommended his followers never to drink of it in future, but by way of phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>The grand fe&s;tival of the Turks is the Bayram, corre&s;ponding to the Ea&s;ter of the Chri&s;tians. It begins the moment the new moon can be di&s;covered, which &s;ucceeds that of the Ramazan. Happy is the man who can fir&s;t di&s;cover it, for which he is amply rewarded by the Mufti, or Grand Vi&s;ir, and the tidings are immediately made public by a general di&s;charge of artillery, and mu&s;ic in&s;tantly &s;triking up. The common people then leave their work, go about congratulating each other, and betake them&s;elves to different amu&s;ements, every counte|nance expre&s;&s;ing uncommon &s;atisfaction and plea&s;ure during the three days that this fe&s;tival continues. The fir&s;t morning after the new moon, the Grand Signor &s;ets out, as &s;oon as it is light, for the principal mo&s;que in Con&s;tantinople, attended by his whole court, in the mo&s;t &s;uperb dre&s;&s;es; and as he pa&s;&s;es along, throws money to the populace, and at the mo&s;que &s;acrifices three &s;heep. His return from the place of wor&s;hip is accompanied with equal &s;plendor, after which he enters the divan chamber, and &s;eats him&s;elf on the throne, to receive the compliments of the Grand Vi&s;ir, and all the officers of &s;tate, with the whole body of eccle&s;ia&s;tics; who all pro&s;trate
<PB N="82" REF="83">
them&s;elves at the foot of the throne, crying "May the days of the Sultan be happy!" The la&s;t per&s;on who pays his re&s;pects, is the Agha of the Jani&s;&s;aries, who, on his return home, is attended by a retinue as &s;plendid as that of the Grand Signor. Every Turki&s;h lord receives the &s;ame compliments that day from his inferiors.</P>
<P>The Sultanas who are &s;hut up in the old &s;eraglio, have the liberty, likewi&s;e, on that day, to pay their re&s;pects to the Grand Signor, and to vi&s;it the Sultana-mothers; it is, therefore, the plea&s;ante&s;t day, to them, of the whole year, for they are permitted to walk in the delicious gardens of the &s;eraglio, and may obtain any little favour they a&s;k of the monarch. The principal per&s;onages of the empire dine, on that day, at the &s;eraglio, on a particular invitation from the Sultan; but he does not eat with them. Before they partake of this entertainment, &s;ixteen of the principal officers of &s;tate are robed, by the Sultan him&s;elf, with rich pellices, or caftans, a ceremony corre&s;ponding with the inve&s;titure of the different orders of knighthood, by the other princes of Eu|rope. This &s;olemnity ended, the Grand Signor withdraws to the interior part of the &s;eraglio. Se|venty days after the Grand Bayram, there is another fe&s;tival called the Little Bayram. The Sultan goes to the mo&s;que, with the &s;ame ceremony, on the fir&s;t
<PB N="83" REF="84">
day of this fe&s;tival, as he does on that of the other, and &s;acrifices three &s;heep; with this difference, that the &s;heep mu&s;t be larger than for the Grand Bayram, and painted of all &s;orts of colours; they mu&s;t, like|wi&s;e, have the &s;ign of the half moon, or cre&s;cent, on them: the&s;e &s;heep are placed at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the door of the mo&s;que; it being required that the Grand Signor &s;hould kill one of them with his own hand, before he enters the mo&s;que. Every per&s;on of fortune kills &s;ome &s;heep on that day, as a &s;acrifice. The Little Bayram la&s;ts three days, but the &s;acrifice of &s;heep is only on the fir&s;t; whereas on the Grand Bayram, every day is a day of &s;a|crifice.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t magnificent and the large&s;t edifices at Con&s;tantinople are the mo&s;ques. They are almo&s;t all built upon the &s;ame plan, having a dome and minarets, that is to &s;ay, a kind of turrets from which the inferior Imans call the people to prayers. At the &s;tated hours appointed for that purpo&s;e, they go up to the&s;e minarets; and in tho&s;e mo&s;ques which have none, &s;tand at the porch, and clapping their thumbs to their ears, call out with a loud voice, in Arabic, <HI>Alla Hecbar,</HI> which &s;ignifies, "God is great." this they repeat &s;everal times, and then invite the people to prayers; in tho&s;e mo&s;ques where there are &s;everal minarets, filled with people, crying out,
<PB N="84" REF="85">
altogether, very loud, and in different tones; &s;o many voices make a &s;ymphony very plea&s;ing to the ears of Mahometans.</P>
<P>Though the voice of the&s;e criers does not &s;ound &s;o loud as the ringing of bells, which is not permitted by their religion; yet, coaches not being in u&s;e in the &s;treets of Con&s;tantinople, nor any trades carried on in that city, the noi&s;e of which deafens the ear; their notes, which are generally pretty &s;hrill, ea&s;ily pa&s;s through all the quarters of the city, and may be heard at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The good mu&s;&s;ul|men take great delight in a&s;cending the minarets to a&s;&s;i&s;t the&s;e Imans in their holy office. There are a great number of the&s;e mo&s;ques called royal ones, but they are only to be found in the cities of Bur&s;a, Adrianople and Con&s;tantinople, as having been the re&s;idence of the Sultans. The fixed revenues of the principal one, that of St. Sophia, which we have already &s;o amply de&s;cribed, amount to fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. The revenues of the&s;e mo&s;ques are by no means either equal or certain, as &s;ome depend on pen&s;ions from the Sultan, or contribu|tions from the people, and others on the lands of villages, &s;ometimes of whole provinces. The people inhabiting places obliged to contribute from the pro|duce of their lands to the &s;upport of the mo&s;ques, enjoy very great privileges, among which is an ex|emption
<PB N="85" REF="86">
from quartering of &s;oldiers, or any other per&s;on in the &s;ervice of the prince. To be &s;en&s;ible of the value of this privilege, it is nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that the military, and other per&s;ons em|ployed in the Grand Signor's &s;ervice, are very numerous, and almo&s;t always in motion; &s;o that the countries through which they travel, are ruined by them; for they are very oppre&s;&s;ive, and in&s;i&s;t on being treated almo&s;t as well as the monarch him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The mo&s;ques founded by private per&s;ons cannot confer the&s;e privileges, becau&s;e they have no reve|nues ari&s;ing from land; their whole income ari&s;es from the intere&s;t of &s;ums lent, which is eighteen per cent: this privilege of lending money on intere&s;t, being granted only to the mo&s;ques and the Jews; for the Mahometan laws &s;trictly forbid this way of traffic, in any other in&s;tances, under penalty of lo&s;ing the principal, if di&s;covered.</P>
<P>To build a mo&s;que, is not a cu&s;tom followed indifferently by all the Turki&s;h emperors, &s;ince all have not a right, that being only to be acquired by conque&s;t. The Sultan, before he can build a tem|ple within the walls of Con&s;tantinople, mu&s;t have gained &s;ome victory over the enemies of the empire, or have extended the Ottoman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and there|fore merited the &s;urname of <HI>Gazi,</HI> or conqueror.
<PB N="86" REF="87">
Sultan <HI>Mahmoud,</HI> who had legally acquired this right by gaining the battle of Gro&s;ca, again&s;t the Ger|mans, and taking Belgrade, erected a very beautiful one within the capital. When he had re&s;olved on rai&s;ing this edifice, he procured from Italy, France, and England, the mo&s;t elegant de&s;igns and models to be found in Europe, proper for his undertaking. From the&s;e, that prince, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great abilities and ta&s;te, formed him&s;elf the plan of his mo&s;que, which he &s;hewed to the Ulemas, or body of eccle|&s;ia&s;tics and lawyers united. They objected that it more re&s;embled a Chri&s;tian church than a mo&s;que, and advi&s;ed their ma&s;ter to give it a form more agree|able to the Mahometan ta&s;te, that it might not of|fend the common people. Sultan <HI>Mahmoud,</HI> obliged to give way to the in&s;inuations of the heads of the law, produced a mon&s;trous mixture of the European and Turki&s;h &s;tyle, though &s;till magnificent and ele|gant. He ornamented the court of this mo&s;que with a &s;uperb colonade, the idea of which was fur|ni&s;hed by the church of St. Peter, at Rome, which he executed in miniature. He employed, in this work, the rich columns that had formed the peri&s;|tyle of the ancient palace of the kings of Pergamus, which had e&s;caped the ravages of time, but were taken down, and removed to Con&s;tantinople. Sul|tan <HI>Mahmoud</HI> died before this building was fini&s;hed; <HI>O&s;man,</HI> his brother and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, con&s;ulted the pro|fe&s;&s;ors
<PB N="87" REF="88">
of the law, to know if he might compleat it, and give it his name. The Mufti delivered his Fetfa, or opinion, in which he declared, that this building not being fini&s;hed, or dedicated to religious wor&s;hip, could only be looked on as an edifice, the property of which inconte&s;tibly ve&s;ted in his brother, by right of inheritance; and by con&s;equence, he might take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and complete the unfini&s;hed building, con&s;ecrate it by the prayers of the faithful, and give it his own name. In virtue of this decree, the mo&s;que, though built by Sultan <HI>Mahmoud,</HI> was called the Splendor of <HI>O&s;man:</HI> by which name, the mo&s;ques erected by different emperors are u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Mufti is the &s;overeign Pontiff, he is, at once, the expo&s;itor of the law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> he has, therefore, a two-fold &s;overeign authority, in all ca&s;es, religious and civil. His election depends entirely on the Grand Signor, who, commonly, ap|points to this high office, men who are eminent for their integrity and learning.</P>
<P>When the Mufti is elected, which mu&s;t be from the order of Moulahs, he is ordered, by the Grand Signor, to repair to the palace; where he inve&s;ts him in his dignity and office, with his own hands, by cloathing him with a pellice of ermine, lined with
<PB N="88" REF="89">
white cloth; giving him, at the &s;ame time, a hand|kerchief embroidered with &s;ilver, containing a thou|&s;and Turki&s;h pia&s;tres, in gold. He then pays a vi&s;it to the Grand Vi&s;ier, who receives him at the foot of the &s;tairs, and conducts him to the great hall of the Divan, where he gives him the &s;eat of honor, and puts another pellice upon him, of ermine, lined with green cloth: when he departs, the Vi&s;ir attends him to the door, and orders him to be waited on by &s;everal of his officers, loaded with the rich pre|&s;ents which he is obliged to make him, upon his election.</P>
<P>The Mufti is held in as much reverence by the Turks, as the Pope is at Rome. He is not denied the privilege of marriage, though he is expected to make his re&s;idence at Con&s;tantinople. His authority is &s;o great, that when he pa&s;&s;es a definitive &s;entence, the Grand Signor him&s;elf never contradicts it. The difficulties which are propo&s;ed to him, and his &s;ol|lutions, whether as to ca&s;es of con&s;cience, or any other matters are committed to writing. His reply is generally very conci&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting only of a &s;imple affirmative or negative, to which are added the&s;e words, "God is the be&s;t judge," by which he &s;hews he does not pretend to infallibility. The Grand Signor has a power of di&s;placing him, but
<PB N="89" REF="90">
yet he never ventures to engage in any affairs of importance, without his con&s;ent previou&s;ly obtained.</P>
<P>Next to the &s;ublime office of Mufti, is that of the <HI>Caddila&s;chirs,</HI> or Judges, of which there are two, one for Romania, and the other for Natolia. Their juri&s;diction extends to military cau&s;es, as their title &s;ets forth, for <HI>Caddi</HI> means judge, and <HI>la&s;chir</HI> &s;ignifies militia. This office makes a per&s;on eligible for that of Mufti.</P>
<P>To the <HI>Caddila&s;chirs</HI> &s;ucceed the Moulahs. This body of people, who are the expounders of the law and religion, in Turkey, furni&s;h many examples in former times, that, when unanimous, they are entire ma&s;ters of the people; and can influence them &s;o as to dethrone the mo&s;t &s;kilful and vigilant monarch that ever reigned. They are very numerous, and are treated with particular di&s;tinction by the Sultan.</P>
<P>The &s;uperintendants or &s;uperiors of the Mo&s;ques, are cho&s;en by the Grand Vi&s;ir: the&s;e are called <HI>Imans.</HI> Upon a vacancy, the inhabitants within the di&s;trict of the Mo&s;que, pre&s;ent another to the Vi&s;ir, who generally accepts their recommendation, and of his own authority, without any previous cere|mony, inve&s;ts him Iman of the Mo&s;que to which he has been recommended. The Mufti has no ju|ri&s;diction over them, but, in civil and criminal
<PB N="90" REF="91">
ca&s;es, they are &s;ubject to the juri&s;diction of the common magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>The Emirs may likewi&s;e be ranked in the cla&s;s of eccle&s;ia&s;tics: they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of the Turks by a green turban, the favourite colour of the prophet.</P>
<P>They are eligible to any office in the &s;tate, and may a&s;pire to the mo&s;t honourable. The privileges they have are very great, and, among others, that of having any per&s;on's hand cut off, who affronts or &s;trikes them. The Turks, however, have found the means of evading this barbarous law; for when they meet any Emirs in the &s;treet, who are drunk, and have any altercation with them, which frequently happens, they take off their green turbans, with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, and then give them a good drub|bing: the only mark of an Emir being his green turban, when it is taken off, they pretend not to know them, and this &s;tratagem &s;ecures them from puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>An eternity of rewards and puni&s;hments is one of the fundamental maxims of their religion. Yet there are &s;ects among the Mahometans who do not believe in it. For example, the <HI>Giahamites</HI> &s;ay this eternity is metaphorical, as when we wi&s;h the reign of a prince
<PB N="91" REF="92">
may endure for ever; and the <HI>Giahedites</HI> believe that the damned, in cour&s;e of time, will be changed into fire, like all other matters con&s;umed by that element. Among the followers of <HI>Ali,</HI> there is a &s;ect which takes its name from a doctor called <HI>Alk|hathab,</HI> who teaches that the delights of paradi&s;e, and the pains of hell, are nothing more than the plea&s;ures and afflictions of the pre&s;ent life.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be imagined that the happine&s;s promi&s;ed by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> is confined to the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e alone; for though the prophet &s;ays that true believers will find in his paradi&s;e, gardens on the borders of rivers, where they will live to all eternity, with women who&s;e youth and beauty will ever remain; yet, he adds, that be&s;ides the&s;e delights they will enjoy the &s;ight of God, which will make them perfectly happy. His hell contains very uncommon objects, nothing but the heads of devils. An angel, likewi&s;e, pre&s;ides here on the part of God, and this hell, according to the alcoran, has &s;even doors, The greate&s;t, how|ever, of all their misfortunes, in this place, will be their &s;eparation from God.</P>
<P>Prede&s;tination is one of the frightful doctrines taught by the alcoran; viewed, however, under certain a&s;pects it has its advantages. It is to this doctrine that the Porte is indebted for the facility with
<PB N="92" REF="93">
which &s;uch numerous armies are rai&s;ed. It likewi&s;e tends to calm the u&s;ele&s;s affliction of a father on the death of his children, or of a per&s;on who has lo&s;t all his property by &s;ome rever&s;e of fortune, or his honour, through the inju&s;tice of his equals. The populace who carry every thing to extremes, acts in the &s;ame manner with regard to prede&s;tination. Du|ring the plague, they will purcha&s;e the cloaths of a per&s;on who is ju&s;t dead of this di&s;order, which they will in&s;tantly put on their back, and &s;ay that they can only die of that death which is decreed them by fate. This doctrine of prede&s;tination is very ancient in Ea&s;tern countries. We read in <HI>Homer,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Bicari,</HI> that the affairs of this world are conducted by a kind of fatality to which Jupiter him&s;elf is obliged to &s;ub|mit, equally with the lowe&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>The re&s;urrection of the dead is likewi&s;e implicitly believed by the Turks. One of the &s;igns, which are to precede it, &s;ay they, is that all the animal cre|ation will die, that the mountains will fly in the air like birds, and that the heavens will melt and run upon the earth.</P>
<P>Their ablutions and circumci&s;ion are likewi&s;e drawn from the ancient cu&s;toms of the Ea&s;t. It would be ridiculous to in&s;i&s;t that circumci&s;ion was not ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary in the Ea&s;t, when it is known that
<PB N="93" REF="94">
there are many people in A&s;ia who would otherwi&s;e be u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ociety. And with re&s;pect to their ab|lutions, the A&s;&s;yrians according to Strabo, made u&s;e of them at all times, after performing the duties of marriage. The eating of pork was forbidden, either becau&s;e it was unwhole&s;ome in the country where Mahomet introduced his religion, or el&s;e to make his court to the Jews, who were di&s;per&s;ed in all tho&s;e parts where his doctrine was preached.</P>
<P>The Mahometans believe both in the new and old te&s;tament. They often cite the new te&s;tament, and will &s;ometimes cite what is not to be found in it; &s;ay|ing that the Chri&s;tians have altered the text, becau&s;e they have retrenched every thing relating to <HI>Mahomet.</HI> And the Jews, they add, have done the &s;ame by the old te&s;tament.</P>
<P>The Turks bear no enmity to each other, and whenever any di&s;putes ari&s;e among&s;t them, they al|ways endeavour to be reconciled before Friday, the day of their Sabbath; being obligated, before they begin their prayers, to declare in the pre&s;ence of God, that they freely forgive their enemies; or el&s;e they believe their prayers will not be acceptable.</P>
<P>If per&s;ons di&s;pute, or come to blows, in Turkey, notwith&s;tanding all the entreaties that are made u&s;e
<PB N="94" REF="95">
of to prevent them, any one is at liberty to &s;eparate them, by calling out <HI>charoe ulla,</HI> that is "by the Law of God," they are then carried before the Cadi, or Judge, who puni&s;hes them for their ob&s;tinacy. For this purpo&s;e the offender is laid on his back, and re|ceives two or three hundred &s;trokes, on the &s;oles of his feet; be&s;ides having a fine, of two or three thou|&s;and a&s;pers, levied upon him, for &s;uffering him&s;elf to be &s;o far carried away by his pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The &s;everity of this law, has not only re&s;trained the Turks within the bounds of their duty; but has likewi&s;e accu&s;tomed them to refrain from &s;wearing, and profaning the &s;acred name of God; a practice too common among other nations, who pretend to be more civilized than the Mahometans. The greate&s;t oath, they u&s;e to atte&s;t the truth of any thing is, <HI>valla hebilla,</HI> which means, "by the God whom I adore."</P>
<P>The Turks, like the Chri&s;tians, have their con|vents and religious orders. The origin of the&s;e in|&s;titutions, both with re&s;pect to the time and cau&s;e of them, is like tho&s;e of the Roman Catholics, entirely fabulous. The two principal orders are, the Der|vi&s;es, and the Santons. I had the curio&s;ity, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> to vi&s;it one of the mona&s;teries of the Der|vi&s;es, and to ob&s;erve their devotions; which are as
<PB N="95" REF="96">
whim&s;ical as any at Rome. Their fellows are confined to an odd habit, which is only a piece of coar&s;e white cloth, wrapped about them, with their legs and arms naked. Their order has few other rules, except that of performing their fanta&s;tic rites, every Tue&s;day and Friday; which is done in this manner. They meet together in a large hall, where they all &s;tand, with their eyes fixed to the ground, and their arms acro&s;s, while the Iman, or preacher, reads part of the alcoran, from a pulpit placed in the mid&s;t; and when he has done, eight or ten of them make a melancholy concert with their pipes, which are no un-mu&s;ical in&s;truments. Then he reads again, and makes a &s;hort expo&s;ition on what he has read; after which they &s;ing and play, till their &s;uperior (the only one of them dre&s;&s;ed in green) ri&s;es and begins a &s;ort of &s;olemn dance. They all &s;tand about him in a regular figure, and while &s;ome play, the others tie their robe (which is very wide) fa&s;t round their wai&s;t, and begin to turn round with an amazing &s;wiftne&s;s, and yet with regard to the mu&s;ic, moving &s;lower or fa&s;ter as the tune is played. This la&s;ts above an hour without any of them &s;hewing the lea&s;t appear|ance of giddine&s;s, which is not to be wondered at, when it is to be con&s;idered they are all u&s;ed to it from their infancy; mo&s;t of them being devoted to this way of life from their birth. The&s;e turning round among&s;t them, &s;ome little Dervi&s;es of &s;ix or
<PB N="96" REF="97">
&s;even years old, &s;ays <HI>Lady M.</HI> who &s;eemed no more di&s;ordered by that exerci&s;e than the others. At the end of the ceremony they &s;hout out, "There is no other God, but God, and <HI>Mahomet</HI> is his prophet!" After which they ki&s;s the &s;uperior's hand, and retire. The whole is performed with the mo&s;t &s;olemn gravity. Nothing can be more au&s;tere than the form of the&s;e people; they never rai&s;e their eyes, and &s;eem de|voted to contemplation. And, as ridiculous as this is in de&s;cription, there is &s;omething very affecting in the air of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and mortification they a&s;&s;ume. By a rule of their in&s;titution, a Dervi&s;e mu&s;t not eat more than eight ounces a day.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Dervi&s;es who are &s;ufficiently impudent to take advantage of the general ignorance of the Turks, &s;et up for prophets, and prophecy with impunity. If it happen, that the event ju&s;tifies their predictions, they are looked upon as &s;aints, and held in great e&s;teem; nay, tho&s;e, who for want of &s;ucce&s;s, can pa&s;s only for fools, find admi&s;&s;ion every where. Nothing can re&s;i&s;t their effrontery; the name of God, profaned by the&s;e ra&s;cals, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> always impo&s;es on the &s;uper&s;titious multitude; and I have &s;een one of them come and &s;eat him&s;elf, in&s;olently, by the Grand Vi&s;ir, whil&s;t I have been privately di&s;cour&s;ing with him; and people of great con&s;equence kept at a di&s;|tance. The fanatici&s;m of the public obliges the mo&s;t
<PB N="97" REF="98">
enlightened per&s;ons to &s;ubmit; and the mo&s;t eminent Turks have no other means to get rid of this rabble, than by giving them money; which &s;erves only to make them more trouble&s;ome and in&s;olent.</P>
<P>Their principal convent is at Cogni, in Natolia, without the walls of the city; its circuit is about a mile and an half, and it contains five hundred cham|bers, for as many Dervi&s;es; but the greate&s;t part are generally from home. When I vi&s;ited them, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> I found but ninety in the convent, the re&s;t being di&s;per&s;ed throughout the empire; either in other convents, or living privately with women; for though they are allowed to marry, their wives are not permitted to live with them in the convent. They are called poor Dervi&s;es, but with little rea&s;on, for they take care to provide them&s;elves with all the conveniences of life; yet, to keep up appearances, their cloathing is coar&s;e and &s;imple; con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;hirt made of ordinary linen, a robe, or tunic, of a dark coloured flannel, and a &s;urtout of white woollen cloth; their &s;tomach and their legs are naked, upon their heads they wear a round cap of camel's hair, and they have a leather girdle round their wai&s;t. They generally have a chaplet in their hands, and keep con&s;tantly turning over their beads, repeating, at the &s;ame time, the name of God. Be|&s;ides the ob&s;ervance of the Ramazan, in common
<PB N="98" REF="99">
with the re&s;t of the Turks, they fa&s;t every Tue&s;day, Thur&s;day and Friday. The rapidity with which they turn them&s;elves in their devotions, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> is &s;o great, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h their coun|tenances, or their forms; and they do it with &s;o much dexterity, that it is the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing &s;pec|tacle in nature. Some of them fall into extacies, in imitation of their founder; who, when he was ex|hau&s;ted with his whirling round, fell into &s;woons, and then had his vi&s;ions from the prophet, to found the in&s;titutions. They eat great quantities of opium, and are &s;o &s;tupified by this drug, as to be almo&s;t de|prived of rea&s;on, and all corporeal &s;en&s;ation. Some of them are thrown into the &s;ame &s;tate by wine, and other fermented liquors, of which they con&s;ume more at pre&s;ent, than the re&s;t of the Turks.</P>
<P>The religious tenets of the Santons, are very dif|ferent from tho&s;e of the Dervi&s;es. They hold it as a maxim, that if God permits them to live through the day; it is that they may make the be&s;t of it, which they contend, is by gratifying their pa&s;&s;ions. They con&s;tantly repeat the&s;e words, "To-day is for us, and to morrow for him that &s;hall then be alive." There is neither au&s;terity, nor hypocri&s;y in this or|der of men; for they preach publicly, that paradi&s;e may be as ea&s;ily gained by making u&s;e of the good things of this world, as by ab&s;tinence and &s;everity of
<PB N="99" REF="100">
manners. For this rea&s;on, they think only of eating and drinking, and &s;pending their time in all manner of amu&s;ements. They look upon the tavern as &s;acred as the mo&s;que; and hold the homage paid there to Bacchus, as plea&s;ing to the Divine Being, as that of|fered to him in our places of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>There is another &s;ect of religious in Turkey, who make charity the ba&s;is of their in&s;titution; this they extend even to animals; and one of their prin|cipal concerns is to feed, and take care of, the dogs that are employed in the &s;treets; they will frequently likewi&s;e purcha&s;e pigeons, and other fowls, for the plea&s;ure of letting them fly. There is another or|der, who do not profe&s;s ab&s;tinence of any kind; but who&s;e &s;ole employment is, to &s;ing the prai&s;es of God in Arabic ver&s;es. The novices of this order undergo a very rigid noviciate; they are &s;hut up alone in a chamber forty days, and have no other nouri&s;hment, than twenty-four drachms of dry bread every day. It is only by &s;upporting this trial, with fortitude and chearfulne&s;s, that a candidate can obtain admi&s;&s;ion to the fraternity.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the Jani&s;&s;aries profe&s;s the doctrine of another &s;ect, which di&s;charges its follow|ers from every obligation to attend prayers; the founder having maintained that they were not nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="100" REF="101">
to obtain eternal life; this order, of cour&s;e, is very plea&s;ing to military people, who are in general not much di&s;po&s;ed for practical devotion. But unfor|tunately, he is accu&s;ed of having propagated the lawfulne&s;s of that mo&s;t unnatural vice; which is but too much practi&s;ed by the Turks of the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Pey&s;onnel,</HI> all the Turki&s;h monks are divided into two orders; the <HI>Mevlevis,</HI> and the <HI>Bek|tachis.</HI> The <HI>Mevlevis</HI> are cloi&s;tered, and live toge|ther in convents; though they have liberty to go out, during their hours of recreation. Tho&s;e who turn round and howl, belong to the order of the <HI>Mevlevis,</HI> though they have different rules; ju&s;t as the Capu|chins, Recollets, and Cordeliers, are all of the or|der of St. Francis, though they differ from each other, in their regulations and habits. The <HI>Bekta|chis</HI> have no convents, or fixed habitations, but wan|der about. They often attach them&s;elves to the great. I have known &s;everal Pachas, adds the above author, who have taken them with them, when they travelled; and kept them con&s;tantly in their hou&s;es, as the Italian Nobles do their confe&s;&s;ors. Some of them are exceedingly acute, active, &s;ubtle, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;iderable wit and information. Many of the&s;e Dervi&s;es <HI>Baktachis</HI> u&s;ually follow the army, when it takes the field; and no <HI>Orta,</HI> or regiment
<PB N="101" REF="102">
of Jani&s;&s;aries, makes the lea&s;t motion to change their garri&s;on, open a campaign, or perform any cere|mony, without one of the&s;e Dervi&s;es preceding their march. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, they generally have the feet, legs, and a part of the body naked; they throw cro&s;s-ways, over their &s;houlders, the &s;kin of a tyger, lion, or &s;ome other wild bea&s;t; and carry in their hand a pike, halberd, or battle-ax; and as they march, &s;ing ver&s;es in prai&s;e of the <HI>Orta;</HI> and offer up prayers for the glory of their holy religion, <HI>and the pro&s;perity</HI> of the Turki&s;h Empire.</P>
<P>The Mahometan religion, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> is divided into a greater number of &s;ects, than any other. The common opinion is, they amount to &s;eventy-two; but there is rea&s;on to believe, they greatly exceed that number.</P>
<P>To be convinced of this, it is nece&s;&s;ary to pay particular attention to the conver&s;ation of different Turks, on the &s;ubject of their religion; we &s;hall thereby di&s;cover, that almo&s;t every individual has a &s;y&s;tem of his own, different from his neighbour; &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak with preci&s;ion, of all the Mahometan &s;ects. The two principal ones, from which all the re&s;t have &s;prung, as we have before ob|&s;erved, are tho&s;e of <HI>Omar</HI> and <HI>Ali;</HI> the Ottoman Turks are di&s;ciples of <HI>Omar,</HI> and the Per&s;ians of the
<PB N="102" REF="103">
latter. The hatred that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the&s;e two &s;ects is incredible. Of their implacability, and the e&s;&s;ential difference&punc; in their religious tenets, it may therefore be expedient to render a more particular account.</P>
<P>The origin of their reciprocal hatred is very ancient, being derived from the Per&s;ian legi&s;lator him&s;elf, and aro&s;e in the following manner, &s;ays <HI>Ha|be&s;ci; Mahomet,</HI> in his la&s;t moments, having declared <HI>Ali</HI> his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the three other competitors, upon the death of the prophet, took advantage of <HI>Ali</HI>'s ab&s;ence&punc; who was then propagating the Mahometan faith, on the confines of Per&s;ia, and entered into an alliance to exclude him from the high &s;tation, to which the prophet had appointed him; and by force of arms they &s;et up <HI>Abubeker,</HI> as the true heir and &s;ucce&s;&s;or to <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ali,</HI> finding that the la&s;t will and orders of the prophet were rendered null, and his hopes di&s;ap|pointed by this mea&s;ure, acted neverthele&s;s with great moderation towards his antagoni&s;ts. As <HI>Abubeker</HI> was very old, he &s;atisfied him&s;elf, for the pre&s;ent, with the power he had acquired, at the head of his army, on the borders of Per&s;ia; not doubting, but that after the death of <HI>Abubeker,</HI> the dying orders of <HI>Mahomet</HI> would be obeyed, and he &s;hould be elected
<PB N="103" REF="104">
&s;upreme chief of the Mu&s;&s;ulmen; but he was a &s;e|cond time deceived; for upon the death of <HI>Abubeker, Omar</HI> was elected his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and was no &s;ooner inve&s;ted with the &s;overeign authority, than he &s;ought for every opportunity, by force of arms, to oppre&s;s and reduce the adherents of <HI>Ali,</HI> who remained on the frontiers of Per&s;ia, highly exa&s;perated; but un|able, with his inferior force, to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of his rival. Thus circum&s;tanced, he had recour&s;e to religious policy; for, by explaining the precepts of the alcoran, in a manner totally oppo&s;ite to the opinions and practice of <HI>Omar</HI>'s party, and boldly maintaining his to be the true faith of <HI>Mohomet,</HI> he branded <HI>Omar</HI> with the opprobrious title of heretic; and gained a great number of converts; who de|&s;erted the &s;tandard of his rival, and fled to him for protection. The charge of here&s;y was retorted by <HI>Omar</HI> and his followers, and both parties condemned each other to the flames of hell. After the death of <HI>Omar,</HI> &s;uch a formidable force appeared, under the command of <HI>Ali,</HI> that he was peaceably rai&s;ed to the throne; but, in&s;tead of endeavouring to unite both parties, in one common intere&s;t, he u&s;ed his utmo&s;t efforts to cru&s;h the doctrines of his predece&s;&s;or, which had an effect contrary to what was expected; for the animo&s;ity and vengeance of his opponents, took &s;uch deep root, from this ill-timed per&s;ecution, that it could never be eradicated; and, when, it was
<PB N="104" REF="105">
found that the doctrines of <HI>Ali,</HI> owing to his &s;uperior influence, prevailed in both the Arabias, in Per&s;ia, and in other adjacent countries; the di&s;ciples of <HI>Omar</HI> grew more zealous in &s;upport of the opinions of their decea&s;ed ma&s;ter, and took care to tran&s;mit, from father to &s;on, that mortal hatred which, to this hour, animates both per&s;ua&s;ions.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t great article of difference, in their rituals, re&s;pects the chief of their religion. The Ottomans believe, that the Mufti of Con&s;tantinople is the only &s;upreme infallible head of the church; the Per&s;ians believe, the &s;ame of the Mufti of Per&s;ia. This dif|ference gave ri&s;e to numberle&s;s per&s;ecutions, and a &s;warm of different &s;ects, &s;pringing from the &s;ame &s;ource. The Per&s;ians reject, with horror, three of the greate&s;t doctors of the Mahometan laws, <HI>Abube|ker, O&s;man,</HI> and <HI>Omar.</HI></P>
<P>The virulence of the&s;e two &s;ects is &s;o great, that both parties have condemned each other to the flames of hell. The Per&s;ians, to enrage the Ottomans as much as po&s;&s;ible, de&s;pi&s;e the green colour, which was the favourite one of the prophet, and even put it to the meane&s;t u&s;es; making their &s;ocks and &s;lippers of it, that they may tread the colour under their feet. They eat all kinds of meat, and drink wine, without any &s;cruple; but the chief accu&s;ation of the Turks
<PB N="105" REF="106">
is, that the law of <HI>Ali</HI> permits one woman to marry &s;everal men. The Per&s;ians are likewi&s;e commanded by their law, to lay wa&s;te, and ruin, the countries belonging to the Turks; to &s;trip their women quite naked, and to carry them off to be made &s;laves. From the&s;e principles the Turks conclude, that it is impo&s;&s;ible a Per&s;ian &s;hould ever become a good and faithful &s;ervant; or ever be converted to the true faith. This per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> is &s;o rooted in the minds of the Turks, that no Per&s;ian is ever &s;uf|fered to enter the walls of the &s;eraglio, in Con&s;tan|tinople; though per&s;ons, profe&s;&s;ing all other reli|gions, may be admitted there, and become good Mu&s;&s;elmen.</P>
<P>The Turks believe, or affect to believe, that the &s;ouls of the Jews, after their death, are converted into a&s;&s;es, to carry the &s;ouls of the Per&s;ians into hell. In fine, they po&s;itively maintain that a Turk, who kills a &s;ingle Per&s;ian, has more merit than in kill|ing five Chri&s;tians in battle.</P>
<P>A va&s;t number of &s;ects, as we ob&s;erved before, have &s;prung from tho&s;e of <HI>O&s;man</HI> and <HI>Ali;</HI> which either from their ob&s;curity, or their ab&s;urd opinions, do not merit notice; more e&s;pecially as they are deemed heretical by the Per&s;ians, as well as the Turks: however, it ought not to pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;i|lence,
<PB N="106" REF="107">
that &s;ome of them acknowledge Chri&s;t to be the true Me&s;&s;iah; and approach &s;o near the Chri&s;tian religion, that this is the principal cau&s;e of their re|jection by the Mahometan believers.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h government is well apprized, that many of its &s;ubjects are of the &s;ect of <HI>Ali;</HI> and among the&s;e, there are &s;ome who hold con&s;iderable civil employments, and others who may happen to command their armies: be&s;ides, the inhabitants of al|mo&s;t all the frontier towns, on the &s;ide of Per&s;ia, not only follow the religion of <HI>Ali,</HI> but are prejudiced in favour of the Per&s;ian government; becau&s;e the go|vernors of the Per&s;ian provinces are not &s;o tyran|nical as their own. The Turks, therefore, take every precaution to prevent a rupture with the Per|&s;ians; who if they were not torn to pieces, by civil di&s;&s;ertions, would con&s;tantly &s;eek &s;ome plau&s;ible pre|text, for commencing a war with the Turks; partly from inveterate hatred, but more from a de&s;ire of ex|tending their dominions.</P>
<P>By a due attention to the life of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and the religion he has e&s;tabli&s;hed; it is very clear, that all his precepts may be con&s;idered as political maxims; on the due ob&s;ervance of which, the grandeur and pro&s;|perity of the Turki&s;h government has ever depended. An enquiry then, how far the modern Turks have de|viated,
<PB N="107" REF="108">
from the original in&s;titutes of their founder, cannot but be highly intere&s;ting; as it will lead to an explanation of the cau&s;es, of the pre&s;ent humiliating &s;ituation, of a once formidable power; who&s;e arms were dreaded, in former times, by &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable &s;tates of Europe, and their alliance courted by others; whereas, in the pre&s;ent moment, they ex|cite the pity of &s;ome Chri&s;tian princes, the contempt of others, and the ambition of a third; ready to &s;eize every opportunity to aggrandize it&s;elf, at the expence of its weak, but inoffen&s;ive neighbour. Notwith|&s;tanding the great appearance of devotion among the Turks, the principle of who&s;e religion is Dei&s;m; yet its very oppo&s;ite, Athei&s;m, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> has gene|rally prevailed of late years. Let this be a le&s;&s;on for dei&s;ts in Chri&s;tian countries. It is not in the ex|ternal ob&s;ervation of the Ramazan, in their ablutions, or in the pilgrimage to Mecca, that we mu&s;t look for the pre&s;ent &s;tate of religion, in Con&s;tantinople, the &s;eat of the Turki&s;h empire. It is by conver&s;ation, with Turks of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank and fortune, either in office under government, or living on their revenues, that we can alone di&s;cover the degeneracy of the pre|&s;ent Ottoman race. Some are Pythagoreans; and, firmly believing the tran&s;migration of &s;ouls, would not, on any account, be the death of an animal. Others are profe&s;&s;ed Carte&s;ians, who doubt of every thing,
<PB N="108" REF="109">
and never maintain any opinion deci&s;ively: from per|&s;ons of this pliant de&s;cription, the Mufti is cho&s;en.</P>
<P>The Platonic &s;y&s;tem has likewi&s;e a numerous party, among the profe&s;&s;ors of the law, and the Imans of the royal mo&s;ques; they believe in the unity of the Deity, and in the love they ought to bear their neighbours; which makes them extremely civil and complai&s;ant to &s;trangers. As far as the alcoran agrees with the&s;e principles, they venerate it; but in other re&s;pects, they pay no regard to its numerous ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>But as no people entertain &s;uch doubts of their religion as the Turks, it is not in the lea&s;t &s;upri&s;ing, that they have proceeded one &s;tep further, and em|braced athei&s;m. This fundamental error has pene|trated the mo&s;t private rece&s;&s;es of the &s;eraglio, and infected all parts of the empire. The Ba&s;haws of pro|vinces, in particular, conver&s;e freely upon the &s;y&s;tem of nature. By the word Nature, they mean that in|ternal principle which di&s;po&s;es, and regulates, the conduct of all exi&s;tent beings; from this principle, they &s;ay, the &s;un, moon and &s;tars, derive their origin; and from the &s;ame principle, man has the faculty to rai&s;e him&s;elf upright, to grow, and to bend like the flowers, the gra&s;s, or the trees in the fields.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="110">Some years &s;ince a printing pre&s;s was permitted at Con&s;tantinople, which might have put an end to the national religion of a people, &s;o doubtful and wa|vering in their opinions; if a general in&s;urrection, fomented by the doctors of the law, had not put a &s;top to it. Forty thou&s;and &s;cribes, who had gained their living by copying books, and writing all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be known in that city, would not readily &s;ubmit to a novelty, that was to reduce them to indigence.</P>
<P>One of the political principles of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s reli|gion was, to propagate it by per&s;ua&s;ion; and, if that did not &s;ucceed, by force of arms; for it was nece&s;|&s;ary at all events to increa&s;e the number of his &s;ub|jects. His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and all the different &s;ectaries, adhered &s;trictly to this principle, till of late years. Though they affected to tolerate religions of every kind, yet they &s;pared no pains to make them embrace Mahometi&s;m. If a man, who had children, under fourteen years of age, became a Turk, from mo|tives of intere&s;t perhaps, all the family were ob|liged to follow his example; and, if they pre|tended that they were pa&s;t that age, the Turks would find means to terrify them into a denial of it.

A criminal of any religion, of whatever crime he had been guilty, trea&s;on ex|cepted, might &s;ave his life by turning Mahometan; by the&s;e means, their religion has been &s;o univer|&s;ally propagated, and extended throughout the Ea&s;t; and, even to this day, it is not unu&s;ual to &s;ee fifty pro&s;elytes at a time, demanding the turban from the Grand Vi&s;ir, or the Mufti; but then it is done with a view of &s;ucceeding better in their &s;everal arts and trades in Con&s;tantinople; for mo&s;t of them, in the end, either e&s;cape to &s;ome chri&s;tian country, or to mount Libanon.</P>

<PB N="111" REF="112">
be imagined that Mahometi&s;m it&s;elf was not &s;ecure from his je&s;ts.</P>
<P>A European, one day, appeared at the Porte, and &s;ignified, more by &s;igns than by words, that he was a German, and de&s;ired to turn Turk. On being que&s;tioned as to his motives for renouncing his religion, he informed the vi&s;ir that he was born at Dantzick, and had travelled, with all &s;peed, from thence to Con&s;tantinople, purpo&s;ely to embrace Mahometi&s;m. This re&s;olution appeared too extra|ordinary to the vi&s;ir, for him not to attempt to di&s;cover the real motive; and the candidate being again interrogated, devoutly an&s;wered, that <HI>Mahomet</HI> had appeared to him in a vi&s;ion, to invite him to merit the ble&s;&s;ings attendant on I&s;lami&s;m. Is not this a &s;trange knave? &s;aid the vi&s;ir,&mdash;<HI>Mahomet</HI> has appeared to him, at Dantzick! To an infidel! Though in the cour&s;e of &s;eventy years, during which I have been punctual to my prayers, he has never done me the like honour. Inform him, dragoman, I am not to be deceived with impunity, that he cer|tainly has killed his father or mother; and that, un|le&s;s he will candidly confe&s;s what crime he has been guilty of, I will hang him up in&s;tantly. Terrified at this menace, the traveller confe&s;&s;ed he had been a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, at Dantzick, where he had had the misfortune to occa&s;ion &s;ome di&s;agreeable &s;u&s;picions;
<PB N="112" REF="113">
that the parents of the children, with whom he had been in&s;tructed, had given him a great deal of trouble on this &s;ubject; and that the magi&s;trates likewi&s;e, were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew him no mercy: in order therefore to e&s;cape their &s;entence, and from being informed, that at Con&s;tantinople, &s;o much noi&s;e is not made about &s;o trifling a matter, he had come there to change his religion, and hoped to be &s;oon &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed, to contribute to the education of the Turki&s;h youth. Let him make his profe&s;&s;ion of faith, &s;aid the vi&s;ir, and take the new convert to &s;uch a mollach, mentioning his name, that he may provide for him; they were made for each other, I have &s;ent him a companion; but let them charge the Iman of that quarter, to in&s;truct and inform them both, that no religion has ever tolerated &s;uch practices.</P>
<P>Mahometi&s;m having been e&s;tabli&s;hed by force, it was a maxim never to &s;urrender a town, in which there was a mo&s;que; and as &s;oon as one was taken from the enemy, the fir&s;t thing done was to build a mo&s;que in it, that the Turks might be the more zea|lous for its pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In order to in&s;pire the &s;oldiers with more than or|dinary courage; they are made to believe that tho&s;e, who die fighting again&s;t the infidels, are in&s;tantly tran&s;ported into paradi&s;e, and placed by the &s;ide of
<PB N="113" REF="114">
their prophet; who, from heaven, has been witne&s;s to their heroi&s;m. And this belief formerly produced feats of valour.</P>
<P>We will now beg leave to point out the decline of this great empire, which happens, &s;ooner or later, to all civil &s;ocieties, by a departure from the principles on which they were fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed. Within the la&s;t half century, we have &s;een the Turks yield to the &s;uperior intrepidity of the neighbouring chri&s;tian powers; and to the intrigues of the more di&s;tant ones, carried on by their amba&s;&s;adors at Con&s;tanti|nople. Neither officers nor &s;oldiers, believe now, they &s;hall go in&s;tantly to paradi&s;e, if they are &s;lain in the field of battle, and therefore they fly from before the enemy: in the &s;ea &s;ervice, in particular, the Turks can &s;carce ever be made to &s;tand to their guns.</P>
<P>By land, it is well known, they have given up many towns, both to the Ru&s;&s;ians and Germans, in which there are mo&s;ques. While Prince <HI>Repnin</HI> re|&s;ided at Con&s;tantinople, the Divan gave orders to deliver him all the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;laves, even tho&s;e who had embraced their religion. Chri&s;tians who have pre|&s;ented them&s;elves to the Grand Vi&s;ir, to receive the turban, have likewi&s;e been refu&s;ed, for fear of giving umbrage to the amba&s;&s;ador, from the country in
<PB N="114" REF="115">
which they were born. Europeans have even been known to have turned Mahometans, for their per&s;onal intere&s;t, and afterwards to have renounced their re|ligion again for chri&s;tianity, notwith&s;tanding which they have been &s;uffered to remain at Con&s;tantinople unmole&s;ted. All the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;eem to denote, an approaching revolution in the Turki&s;h &s;y&s;tem of re|ligion; or a total &s;ubver&s;ion of this, once formidable, empire. Perhaps the plan for its annihilation is al|ready laid, in more than one European cabinet. Ru&s;&s;ia has ju&s;t paved the way, by &s;eizing an exten|&s;ive, and valuable part of its domains; the Crimea, and the town and di&s;trict of Oczakow.</P>

<P>THE Ottoman empire was founded by the &s;word, and it was only by force of arms that it ar|rived to that degree of power, which rendered it formidable to the chri&s;tian world. The heroic en|terprizes of the Turki&s;h troops, and the incredible fatigues they underwent in former times, are con|vincing proofs that they were not only, by nature and cu&s;tom, rendered robu&s;t and hardy; but that
<PB N="115" REF="116">
they were al&s;o endowed with excellent capacities: the&s;e accompli&s;hments, however, could not exempt them from tho&s;e revolutions, to which all nations are &s;ubject. A relaxation from the rigid di&s;cipline, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed at their fir&s;t in&s;titution, has introduced a ge|neral corruption: &s;o that they are totally degene|rated, and are no longer the terror of the neigh|bouring countries. Every military corps, throughout the empire, is become the mere &s;purious i&s;&s;ue of what it was in former times.</P>
<P>The military forces of this great empire are, as in other countries, divided into di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es. They con&s;i&s;t of infantry and cavalry. To the infantry be|long the Jani&s;&s;aries, the Topeis, the Kombaragis, the Bo&s;tangis, the Mekteregis, the Serigis, and the Le|vant. The cavalry con&s;i&s;ts of Spahis, Zainis, Tima|riots, Zebiris, Zebganis, and Muclagas. The&s;e forces have not all the &s;ame pay. The Zainis, and the Timariots&punc; are paid from &s;uch lands as the Grand Signor gives them, which are in the nature of the old feudal tenures in chri&s;tian countries; the re&s;t are paid from the Imperial trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>In treating of each cla&s;s of the Turki&s;h military, we &s;hall follow the divi&s;ion u&s;ually made in other countries, by ranging it under the following heads: land forces, artillery, and marines.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117">Of all the Ottoman troops, the corps of Jani&s;|&s;aries, from its ancient reputation, and the very great number of &s;oldiers of which it con&s;i&s;ts, was the mo&s;t re&s;pectable. But, at pre&s;ent, the&s;e troops are a re|proach to the empire; no infantry, of any nation in Europe, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> are upon &s;o de&s;picable a footing. They are contaminated with every vice, and are con&s;equently pu&s;ilanimous; they are, more|over, compo&s;ed of the lowe&s;t dregs of the people. Badly cloathed, without mu&s;ket or &s;abre, and, &s;ub|ject to no di&s;cipline, they are only ready to devour the mi&s;erable &s;oup, &s;ent them by the &s;ultan for their daily food; and to &s;trike terror into the brea&s;ts of all Chri&s;tians, Greeks, and Armenians, who&s;e bu&s;i|ne&s;s obliges them to pa&s;s through the &s;treets where they are quartered: the&s;e they in&s;ult with impunity, becau&s;e no chri&s;tian is allowed to make any reply to them. So cowardly were the&s;e troops, in the la&s;t war, that of 60,000 who marched from Con&s;tanti|nople for the Crimea, not above 6,000 arrived there.</P>
<P>This &s;ubver&s;ion of di&s;cipline, is partly attributed to the pre&s;ent mode of enli&s;ting recruits, and the indolent lives they are &s;uffered to lead in time of peace. In&s;tead of the recruiting parties going into the towns and villages, to enli&s;t the mo&s;t robu&s;t and comely youths, they will receive any per&s;on into the corps of Jani&s;&s;aries. Roman-catholics, Jews, and
<PB N="117" REF="118">
Heathens, are accepted by the officers on the recruit|ing parties; if they have but the appearance of youth and &s;trength, without any enquiries into their prin|ciples. The Armenian patriarch, who re&s;ided at Con&s;tantinople, during the late war, having created a &s;u&s;picion, by &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions in his &s;ermons, that he was a Roman-catholic, the Armenians complained to the Grand Vi&s;ir, and obtained an order to &s;end him to the gallies; but the patriarch being apprized of his danger, he immediately &s;ent for a Colonel of the Jani&s;&s;aries, to whom he made known his &s;ituation, and prayed to be enli&s;ted into his company, which was accordingly done the &s;ame day, and he invited the colonel, with the re&s;t of the officers, of his regi|ment, to dine with him at his hou&s;e the next day, which happened to be Sunday; he officiated as u&s;ual, and, upon coming out of the church, found one party of Jani&s;&s;aries ready to conduct him to the gallies, and another to protect him; but the former in&s;tantly retired, upon hearing from the latter, that the prelate was a <HI>Yengi-cheri,</HI> or new Jani&s;&s;ary, and their officers joined the company at dinner, where they were all very merry at the expence of the Grand Vi&s;ir, who&s;e order to arre&s;t the partriarch was the &s;ubject of ridicule.</P>
<P>The Jani&s;&s;aries are the Ottoman Militia; they are divided into 160 chambers, or regiments, &s;ays <HI>Ha|be&s;ci,</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="119">
and each regiment ought to con&s;i&s;t of 1000 men: but at pre&s;ent they do not amount to more than half that number. The proper term is <HI>Jengit|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eri,</HI> compounded of <HI>Jengi,</HI> new, and <HI>I&s;cheri,</HI> a &s;ol|dier. The&s;e troops were formerly the flower of the Turki&s;h forces, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;chin,</HI> and were fir&s;t formed out of captive chri&s;tians, by the Emperor <HI>Amu|rath</HI> I. They are of a &s;uperior rank to all other &s;oldiers, and are al&s;o more arrogant and factious; and it is chiefly by them that the public tranquility is di&s;turbed. Forty thou&s;and of them are kept con|&s;tantly at Con&s;tantinople, for the city-guard, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t the officers of ju&s;tice; the re&s;t are di&s;per&s;ed in the different provinces of the empire. Every regi|ment has its &s;eparate chamber or barracks, and nei|ther women, nor wine, nor any thing that can corrupt their morals, &s;hould enter the&s;e chambers, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties; but the degeneracy of the times has de&s;troyed all rigid di&s;cipline, and their chambers now are the &s;inks of iniquity.</P>
<P>Each chamber has its <HI>Odda-Bachi,</HI> or Colonel-Com|mandant, its trea&s;urer, its &s;tandard-bearer, and its cook Be&s;ides their pay, they have a daily allowance from the Sultan, of mutton, rice, and butter. They enjoy, however, very great privileges; and an e&s;|teem for their per&s;ons, is &s;o thoroughly rooted in the minds of the common people, that they are generally
<PB N="119" REF="120">
treated with great re&s;pect, if they do not mi&s;behave them&s;elves very much. The Grand Signor him&s;elf is always a Jani&s;&s;ary, and has his name enrolled in one of the chambers; from which he receives his pay of &s;even a&s;pers a day. The pay of a Jani&s;&s;ary, on his fir&s;t enli&s;ting, is one a&s;per a day, which ri&s;es af|terwards, as far as &s;even, according to merit.</P>
<P>Before the Bo&s;tangis were rai&s;ed to the rank of body-guards, as a counterpoi&s;e to the power of the Jani&s;&s;aries, the latter were more highly e&s;teemed, and took more pains to merit it. And it is certain, if they could &s;ubmit to better di&s;cipline, they might &s;till be formidable; not only to their enemies, but even to their own &s;overeigns. For the Grand Sig|nor is very &s;en&s;ible that he reigns chiefly by the &s;upport of this numerous corps, and that they have it in their power, not only to dethrone, but even to &s;trangle him. Many have been the examples, in former times, to demon&s;trate the truth of this ob|&s;ervation. There is a chief in every province, who commands all the Jani&s;&s;aries in that di&s;trict, and who ought to take care that each of them is provided with a &s;erviceable mu&s;ket and a &s;abre. In time of war they fight without order, being totally ignorant of military di&s;cipline. They &s;hould, in time of peace, by the rules of their in&s;titution, be daily
<PB N="120" REF="121">
exerci&s;ed in trials of &s;trength and dexterity, to inure them to fatigue, and accu&s;tom them to agility.</P>
<P>Baron <HI>Tott</HI> mentions an in&s;tance of this a&s;toni&s;h|ing agility, which he was eye-witne&s;s of, in his journey through Moldavia. We were pa&s;&s;ing, &s;ays he, through an agreeable valley, with hills on each &s;ide, where &s;heep were feeding under the care of their &s;hepherds. I was que&s;tioning one of the Ja|ni&s;&s;aries who e&s;corted us, concerning the quality of the wool; you &s;hall judge for your&s;elf, &s;aid he: on this, he &s;purred his hor&s;e through a flock of &s;heep, gallopped through the mid&s;t of it, &s;elected one of the large&s;t, pur&s;ued and overtook it; &s;tooped, &s;eized it by the fleece, raized it with one hand, and re|covering his po&s;ition, threw it acro&s;s the bow of his &s;addle, and rejoined me full &s;peed. In vain did I endeavour to make him re&s;tore his prize to the owner, or pay him the value of it; he laughed at my delicacy, and, at night, regaled him&s;elf and his companion, on his booty.</P>
<P>The Agha of the Jani&s;&s;aries, at Con&s;tantinople, has very exten&s;ive authority; and in the magnifi|cence of his train, and the richne&s;s of his apparel, nearly equals that of the Grand Signor. He re&s;ides in a kind of ca&s;tle, &s;ituated upon a hill, nearly in the centre of the city; his guards are very nume|rous,
<PB N="121" REF="122">
and there are twenty-four con&s;tantly watching in a tower rai&s;ed above the ca&s;tle, to ob&s;erve what pa&s;&s;es in the city, and give immediate notice of any fire. If they fail in their duty, in this particular, their ma&s;ter is involved in di&s;grace, and puni&s;hment. The rules and orders, in ca&s;es of fire, are very &s;ingular; for, if the Grand Signor arrives at any place where there is a fire, before the Grand Vi&s;ir and the Agha of the Jani&s;&s;aries, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to u&s;e their utmo&s;t expedition, to prevent its &s;preading; the Grand Vi&s;ir is obliged to pay him a fine of 12,000 gold ducats, and the Agha 5,000 to the Sultan, and 5,000 to the Vi&s;ir, if he gets there before him. For this rea&s;on, the guard in the tower, before they cry fire, give notice to the Agha, who has always three excellent hor&s;es in readine&s;s. The Sultan and the Grand Vi&s;ir have, likewi&s;e, the &s;ame number, ready &s;addled and bridled; &s;o that it is oftentimes a complete trial of &s;kill in &s;wift riding, to an&s;wer a very benevolent purpo&s;e. The late Sul|tan <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> frequently won the race, becau&s;e he &s;trolled about the city in the night, in di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>The Agha of the Jani&s;&s;aries, at Con&s;tantinople, is al&s;o obliged to be ready, at the door of the mo&s;que, when the Sultan goes to public prayers; to take off his boots, on alighting from his hor&s;e, before he enters the mo&s;que; and, upon his return, mu&s;t draw them

<P>The enrolled Jani&s;&s;aries, according to <HI>Pey&s;onnel,</HI> are &s;o numerous, that if their number could be a&s;cer|tained, it would amount to &s;everal millions; for all men get them&s;elves enli&s;ted that can, being by this enrollment exempted from certain duties and offices. They are, however, e&s;timated at only forty thou&s;and; for which rea&s;on they are called <HI>Kirk Bin Koul,</HI> or the forty thou&s;and &s;laves; and though there may be four hundred thou&s;and on the pay li&s;t, which Baron <HI>Tott</HI> a&s;&s;erts, it is certain the trea&s;ury does not i&s;&s;ue pay for more than fifty thou&s;and, that being only re|ceived by the Jani&s;&s;aries of the <HI>Odas,</HI> or barracks at Con&s;tantinople; and tho&s;e who, in the garri&s;ons, have followed their <HI>kettles.</HI> All tho&s;e who are not with the &s;tandard are called <HI>Yamaks,</HI> and receive no emolu|ment. The divi&s;ion of this body of forces, accord|ing to the above author, is in <HI>Ortas, Buluks,</HI> and <HI>Sey|mens;</HI> forming in all one hundred and ninety-&s;ix companies. The Jani&s;&s;aries are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other Turks by their broad caps; which, being made like the &s;leeves of a <HI>ca&s;aque,</HI> hang down behind, half a foot long, gilt with &s;ilver and embroidered, and have a cone on the forehead.</P>
<P>The arms of the Jani&s;&s;aries are a &s;abre, a bow, an arrow, and a lance. Being drawn before the &s;eraglio,
<PB N="123" REF="124">
to alter their exerci&s;e, and receive new in&s;tructions from Count <HI>Bonneval,</HI> in the u&s;e of fire-arms, they threw their mu&s;kets di&s;dainfully on the ground; and, drawing their &s;abres, cried out "the&s;e arms have &s;uf|ficed to conquer this empire, and will &s;uffice to main|tain it."</P>
<P>They are puni&s;hed, for ordinary crimes, by the ba&s;tinado, or blows on the &s;oles of their feet; and, if they are guilty of any crime, de&s;erving of death, they are &s;trangled, put into a &s;ack, and thrown into the &s;ea; a cannon being likewi&s;e fired, for every Ja|ni&s;&s;ary that &s;uffers in this manner. The&s;e puni&s;h|ments are always inflicted in the night; as no Jani&s;|&s;ary, nor any other &s;oldier, can be publicly puni&s;hed. The Jani&s;&s;aries call each other brethren, and are &s;o attached to one another, that they will not &s;uffer the lea&s;t in&s;ult, to be offered to any of their corps. No per&s;on, be&s;ides their officers, is permitted to &s;trike them, under pain of death. And, if they &s;hould chance to give any other per&s;on a blow, he mu&s;t not re&s;ent the affront by &s;triking; as no protection what|ever, can &s;ave the life of a man who has &s;truck a Ja|ni&s;&s;ary. It is from this great re&s;pect &s;hewn them, that the foreign mini&s;ters have always &s;ome of them in their hou&s;es, as guards; and foreigners in general, are glad to be attended by them in public, being &s;ecure from any in&s;ult, whil&s;t accompanied by them.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="125">The Turki&s;h cavalry, called <HI>Spahis,</HI> were formerly the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Ottoman forces, both with re&s;pect to rank, valour, and di&s;cipline; but their power, and influence, at la&s;t ro&s;e to &s;uch a height, as became dangerous to the Sultan; again&s;t whom they frequently entered into con&s;piracies, and &s;ometimes broke out into open rebellion. The con&s;equences were, the degradation of the whole corps, by <HI>Mahomet</HI> IV. who gave preference to the Jani&s;&s;aries, granting them &s;uch privileges, that he knew would di&s;gu&s;t the principal officers of the <HI>Spahis.</HI> This arrangment had the de&s;ired effect; for the <HI>Spahis,</HI> following the example of their leaders, abandoned the court, and retired to the provinces, where they continued to re|ceive their pay; but when called upon, in time of war, ju&s;t appeared to an&s;wer to the mu&s;ter-rolls, and then returned to their re&s;pective homes, and left the &s;overeign to face the enemy, with other troops. From that aera, they lo&s;t the honour of being con&s;idered as a <HI>corps-de-re&s;erve,</HI> for the body-guard of the Sultan; and their places were &s;upplied by the Jani&s;&s;aries. But the&s;e likewi&s;e, having abu&s;ed the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, the <HI>Bo&s;tangis,</HI> in time, were formed into a corps of Mi|litia, regularly di&s;ciplined, and well armed; and to them, the honourable employ, of being body-guard to the Sultan, in his &s;eraglio, and &s;urrounding his pavil|lion when he is encamped, is at pre&s;ent confided;
<PB N="125" REF="126">
and a formidable guard they are; for their numbers, when compleat, amount to 12,000.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that when any of the Turki&s;h troops lo&s;e their confidence with the Sultan, they alike lo&s;e the e&s;teem of the people; though the greate&s;t part, of the Ottoman army, con&s;i&s;ts of troops taken from the general ma&s;s of the people. Such is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the <HI>Spahis,</HI> who are held in &s;uch &s;overeign contempt, by their countrymen, that they mu&s;t perform wonders in the field, to regain their lo&s;t reputation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spahis,</HI> properly &s;o called, are divided into two cla&s;&s;es. The ancient, who have a yellow en&s;ign, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Ca&s;cars;</HI> and the modern, who humbly call them&s;elves <HI>Spahis-Oglars,</HI> or &s;ervants to the others. They carry a red en&s;ign; and, notwith&s;tanding the more modern date of their in&s;titution, and their mode&s;t title, they are more re|&s;pected than the ancient <HI>Spahis;</HI> and have prece|dence, on a march, in commemoration of their hav|ing re&s;tored the order of battle, and gained a victory, in the reign of Sultan <HI>Mahomet</HI> III. The&s;e two cla&s;|&s;es, in time of war, amount to 12,000, and are paid from the Imperial trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>There are two other corps of cavalry, called <HI>Zainis</HI> and <HI>Timariots;</HI> who hold lands under the Grand Sig|nor,
<PB N="126" REF="127">
by ancient military tenures, and are &s;ummoned to appear in arms, when a war breaks out; but who find means, after a per&s;onal appearance, to leave the camp, and return home, if they have no inclination to take the field; &s;o that they cannot be relied upon, in time of danger. The&s;e compo&s;e the major part of the Turki&s;h cavalry; and the only di&s;tinction, between the&s;e latter corps and the former, is, that they &s;erve by feudal tenure, and receive their pay from the land they hold.</P>
<P>The hope of gaining &s;ome portion of land, in|duces great numbers to join the Zainis, and &s;erve at their own expence, in time of war, as volun|teers. If they perform any &s;ignal action, they are &s;ure to &s;ucceed to the lands of the Zainis, who are &s;lain in battle. If a Zaini, or Timariot, is old, or incapable of &s;ervice, he may re&s;ign to his &s;ons. If he is killed in battle, his income is divided in equal portions, among his children; but if it amounts to only 3,000 a&s;pers a year, the elde&s;t &s;on is the &s;ole heir, and takes his rank. But if he dies a na|tural death, at home, in time of peace, the governor of the province has the di&s;po&s;al of his revenues. In Natolia, there are many lands privileged, becau&s;e they pa&s;s by inheritance, from father to &s;on; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them are not obliged to &s;erve in per&s;on, but may &s;end a lieutenant, with the number
<PB N="127" REF="128">
of hor&s;emen required, in proportion to their in|come.</P>
<P>The Zehe&s;is, who, at their fir&s;t in&s;titution, con|&s;i&s;ted of a &s;ingle corps of 600 men, had the in&s;pec|tion and care of pre&s;erving and cleaning the arms. At pre&s;ent they have changed their employment, and their numbers are con&s;iderably augmented. They are computed at 30,000 hor&s;emen, and are divided into &s;ixty chambers, but they are &s;eldom complete. This corps is con&s;idered in the &s;ame point of view, as the cuira&s;&s;ieurs among the other great powers of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Segbans</HI> are another &s;pecies of cavalry, that the ba&s;haws of provinces are obliged to bring to the army, in time of war. The&s;e are a kind of dra|goons, for they fight on foot, as well as on hor&s;e|back, and form a corps of re&s;erve; it being their duty to take care of the baggage.</P>
<P>The Molagis are con&s;idered, by the Turks, as military men, but, in fact, they are only &s;ervants to the ba&s;haws, who having always a numerous re|tinue, keep a great many dome&s;tics, who co&s;t only their diet and dre&s;s, the Turks never giving any wages. They form a kind of united body in the camp, and make a numerous army of men; but,
<PB N="128" REF="129">
though they are young, robu&s;t, and generally well made, we do not find they ever &s;ignalized them&s;elves by any one act of heroi&s;m. On the contrary, a great part of them are pretended chri&s;tians, and the vile&s;t &s;et of men upon earth. The&s;e are the men who, when a chri&s;tian church is taken, commit every kind of &s;acrilege, break open convents, violate the nuns, and fighting under Turki&s;h banners, exerci&s;e mo&s;t horrid cruelties on the inhabitants of chri&s;tian countries.</P>
<P>Next to the Jani&s;&s;aries, the infantry mo&s;t in repute in the Ottoman &s;ervice, is the corps of <HI>Topchis,</HI> or cannoneers; and the <HI>Kombaragis,</HI> or bombardiers. The former of the&s;e two corps amounts to 18,000 men, of which 6,000 are con&s;tantly kept at Con&s;tan|tinople, and the re&s;t di&s;per&s;ed throughout the pro|vinces; they are divided into regiments, in the &s;ame manner as the Jani&s;&s;aries. Out of &s;o great a num|ber, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> there are not above a dozen of them who are good engineers; being totally ignorant of theory, the only &s;kill they acquire, is by practice; &s;o that in time of action, the &s;ervice of their artil|lery is commonly left to chance.</P>
<P>The corps of bombardiers ought to amount to 2,000, of which, 600 always remain in the capital. But their numbers are never complete, for the of|ficers
<PB N="129" REF="130">
wait till the very moment of marching, to fill up their regiments. This accounts for their want of knowledge. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, however, they are very expert in ca&s;ting cannon, and melt their metals with great &s;kill.</P>
<P>The Turks have no iron cannon, and either know not how, or di&s;dain to ca&s;t it. All their artillery is of bra&s;s, nor have they any other on board their &s;hips; for though we find pieces of iron ordnance, in &s;ome of their fortified places, or on board their merchant-&s;hips, they have all been taken in war, or purcha&s;ed from the Swedes, Danes, or other Europeans. It is, indeed, very &s;urprizing that their founderies &s;hould have no furnaces proper for melt|ing iron; &s;ince that at Tophana &s;ends every day to Con&s;tantinople, a prodigious number of bra&s;s pieces, &s;ome of them of an enormous calibre, excellent, beautiful, and long &s;ince brought to perfection, ac|cording to the proportion and models of the Euro|pean artillery. They are continually to be &s;een ranged along the &s;hore, at Tophana, frequently in double and triple rows; nor can we, without great inju&s;tice, accu&s;e the Turks of total ignorance in the art of ca&s;ting artillery. It is, in fact, difficult to conceive, how they can produce one &s;o beautiful, without furnaces proper for ca&s;ting the &s;mall field-pieces, of which they are in want.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="131">The cannon, however, for which the Turks are famous all over Europe, are called <HI>perieres,</HI> or &s;mall cannon; their only fault is, that they are too &s;hort, &s;o that on board of &s;hips, e&s;pecially under the wind, there is always great ri&s;k of their &s;etting the ve&s;&s;el on fire. The Turks formerly purcha&s;ed their gun-powder of the Engli&s;h; but a renegado, calling him|&s;elf an Engli&s;hman, taught them the art of manu|facturing it; which they have brought to &s;uch per|fection, that Engli&s;h powder is no longer imported into the Ottoman dominions. Yet, owing to the avarice of the makers, in augmenting the quantity of charcoal and &s;ulphur, and dimini&s;hing that of &s;alt-petre, the deare&s;t ingredient, they have adulterated it to &s;uch a degree, that it is no longer equal, in &s;trength, to the be&s;t Engli&s;h powder.</P>
<P>Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> who was employed to make a reform in the Turki&s;h artillery, mentions a bon-mot of Sultan <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> which does not augur much in favour, of the knowledge of the Turks, in that department of the &s;cience of war. The Baron had been employed to throw &s;ome pontoons, over a &s;mall river near the capital, in order to &s;atisfy the Porte that this kind of bridge, which was a novelty in Turkey, was &s;ufficient for the tran&s;portation of artillery. In pa&s;&s;ing over a dangerous frozen place, the Baron, notwith&s;tanding his great precaution, met with a fall, and &s;prained
<PB N="131" REF="132">
his left leg very much. The Grand Signor, though frequent in his enquiries after the Baron's health, was too active to allow him the re&s;t that was nece&s;&s;ary. The Prince, coming afterwards to examine the &s;truc|ture of the&s;e military bridges, after keeping me a long while &s;tanding, &s;ays the Baron, &s;poke to me with much concern of the accident I had met with; on which one of his officers, who had been ordered to attend me in this bu&s;ine&s;s, thinking to make his court to the Sultan, by extolling my activity, talked much of the fatigue I made him undergo; though, in re|ality, he only di&s;covered his own indolence. "Do you not know the rea&s;on of this great difference be|tween you?" &s;aid the Grand Signor, "I will explain it. When <HI>Tott</HI> came into the world, he fell upon his feet, and immediately began to run; whereas you fell on your breech, and there you have remained."</P>
<P>The carriages of their guns are made of oak, and are very heavy, and coar&s;ely wrought; and the iron work is as much too &s;light, and will not hold out any wear. All per&s;ons whatever, except tho&s;e belonging to the corps of artillery, are &s;trictly prohibited to en|ter the foundry.</P>
<P>Baron <HI>Tott</HI> mentions an enormous piece of ord|nance, which will carry a marble ball of eleven hun|dred pounds weight. This piece, ca&s;t in bra&s;s, in
<PB N="132" REF="133">
the reign of Sultan <HI>Amurath,</HI> was compo&s;ed of two parts, joined together by a &s;crew, where the charge is contained, after the manner of an Engli&s;h pi&s;tol.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e, in the Turki&s;h army, a corps of Infantry called <HI>Mekteregis;</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to plan out the camps, in time of war; and to fix and dre&s;s the pavilions, or royal tents, for the Sultan, and great officers of &s;tate, Their &s;kill and alertne&s;s, in the execution of their functions, is highly extolled; and the in&s;titution of this corps is not only econo|mical, but the cau&s;e of pre&s;erving exceeding good order, in the Turki&s;h camps; by preventing all di&s;|putes, about precedence in the &s;ituation, or &s;plendor in the officers' pavilions.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o the management of &s;triking the tents, packing them up, and tran&s;porting them from place to place, when the army is on a march. Their number amounts to 6,000.</P>
<P>One, among many other rea&s;ons, why the Turki&s;h army is &s;o numerous, &s;ays <HI>Pey&s;onnel,</HI> is, that the people in Turkey are divided into two cla&s;&s;es; the <HI>A&s;keris,</HI> or military; and the <HI>Beledis,</HI> or pea&s;ants. Every Mahometan, who does not belong to &s;ome military corps, is obliged to pay a capitation tax, and is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for his &s;hare of the impo&s;ts, levied on
<PB N="133" REF="134">
cities, towns, and villages; and though this law be not vigorou&s;ly put in execution, it cau&s;es many per|&s;ons to enter their names on the li&s;ts.</P>
<P>The attention of government, &s;ays Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> is directed to keep up a variance, between the law and the army; for, unle&s;s they unite, a revolution in government can never take place. War, at pre|&s;ent, is not &s;ought after by the Turks, e&s;pecially by great men; who are always &s;ure to fall a &s;acri|fice; for, if the Jani&s;&s;aries are &s;ucce&s;sful, they grow in&s;olent; and, if they are defeated, they de&s;pond in a very great degree; either of which occa&s;ions the de&s;truction of their leaders. The following anecdote will &s;erve to &s;hew &s;omething of their di&s;po&s;ition. After the death of <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. the Jani&s;&s;aries began an in&s;urrection, and put to death &s;everal of the vi&s;irs, and ba&s;haws; plundered the hou&s;es of others, and committed a great many outrages. There lived at that time, in the city, an old ba&s;haw, called <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> who had formerly been vi&s;ir to Sultan <HI>Amurath;</HI> he was a very good natured man, but extremely igno|rant, and a very had politician; and, to put a &s;top to the &s;edition, it was thought proper to place &s;ome per&s;on on the throne; he therefore went and brought forth young <HI>Corcud, Bajazet</HI>'s brother, who was ab|&s;ent, and cau&s;ed him to be proclaimed emperor, in the room of his father; di&s;tributing, at the &s;ame
<PB N="134" REF="135">
time, great &s;ums of money among them, that they might return to their duty. A &s;hort time after, the Jani&s;&s;aries mutinied again; and, under pretence of excu&s;ing their pa&s;t faults, came to the Divan of the Sultan, and told him, "that all they had done was, by no means, for the &s;ake of plunder; but, merely to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the affairs of the empire, the laws of which were no longer ob&s;erved: that none, but the children of villagers and citizens, had military em|ploys be&s;towed on them; whereas, by the decrees of the fir&s;t Ottoman emperors, the&s;e po&s;ts ought to be filled up, only by tho&s;e who had &s;erved in the troops, and grown old in the exerci&s;es of war: all their pre|ten&s;ions, they &s;aid, went no further than to obtain that, henceforward, the captains, colonels, generals, and governors of provinces, &s;hould be appointed from their corps." The good old fool <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> &s;ays Lord <HI>B.</HI> having read their propo&s;itions, replied, on the part of the Grand Signor, "that their demands were very rea&s;onable; that in future due regard &s;hould be paid to them, and that they might retire in peace." Having been &s;o ea&s;ily gratified, and di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, they returned again directly, and cried out, that they would al&s;o have cho&s;en, from among&s;t them, the <HI>Cadili&s;kier,</HI> who is &s;overeign judge of the army; and ought to be mo&s;t profoundly ver&s;ed in the law. The Ba&s;haw an&s;wered them, "My children, &s;uch an office ought to be held by a per&s;on of wi&s;dom, who
<PB N="135" REF="136">
has &s;tudied the law; is there any one among you who is capable of it?" The Jani&s;&s;aries replied, "that there was one of their comrades, called <HI>Saroug Bu|chiuk,</HI> who knew how to read pretty well, and who did not write ami&s;s; that by &s;tudy, and application, he might acquit him&s;elf very well in this office;" which, the ba&s;haw having heard, &s;aid to them, "I am &s;atisfied, the <HI>Cadili&s;kier</HI> al&s;o &s;hall be yours. Re|main in peace."</P>
<P><HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> who was &s;ecretary to the grand vi&s;ir, in the reign of the late &s;ultan, makes the amount of the military force, of the Ottoman empire, to be 432,570; half of which appear to be cavalry, and the remain|der infantry. But, it being evident, that this im|men&s;e body of forces, cannot form one &s;ingle army, we mu&s;t make the nece&s;&s;ary deductions, to &s;ee what land-forces the Grand Signor can bring into the field, to face an ambitious enemy, who is making daily in|cur&s;ions into his dominions; and di&s;-membering the Ottoman empire, by piece-meal; while the chri&s;tian princes of Europe &s;eem totally unconcerned; not con&s;idering that the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, if &s;he goes on as &s;he has done, will a&s;&s;uredly gain that univer|&s;al monarchy in Europe, to which <HI>Louis</HI> XIV. of France a&s;pired; and, to prevent which, the blood of millions was &s;hed, and many royal trea|&s;uries exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">Should this Crown of Ru&s;&s;ia once get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Con&s;tantinople, and make it the &s;eat of govern|ment for the Ru&s;&s;ian empire, the infatuated Engli&s;h nation, will then bitterly repent their bad policy, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> in having &s;ent their mo&s;t &s;kilful &s;hip-builders to Ru&s;&s;ia, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their be&s;t naval officers, to com|mand her fleets.

<P>After deducting for guards and garri&s;ons, in the different cities and fortre&s;&s;es of this exten&s;ive em|pire, it will not be found, that very little more than half this immen&s;e army, can ever take the field at once. If the Sultan commands the army in per&s;on, or, even if the grand vi&s;ir heads it, the number of men is con&s;iderably increa&s;ed; becau&s;e they are fol|lowed by the cavalry, u&s;ually in the &s;uite of admi|ni&s;tration, and by large bodies of arti&s;ans from the capital: this mixed multitude amounts, at lea&s;t to 50,000 hor&s;emen; but the&s;e augment the number, without adding to the &s;trength of the army.</P>
<P>An ancient cu&s;tom, the origin and ri&s;e of which is no longer known, has mixed the mo&s;t in&s;ipid buf|foonery, with the art of a&s;&s;embling together the forces of this great empire. This ridiculous cere|mony is called, by the Turks, <HI>Alay;</HI> or, the triumph.

It con&s;i&s;ts in a kind of ma&s;querade, in which each trade &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pre&s;ents to the &s;pectators, the me|chanical exerci&s;e of its re&s;pective art. The labourer draws his plough, the weaver handles his &s;huttle, the joiner his plane; and the&s;e different characters, &s;eated in cars, richly ornamented, commence the proce&s;&s;ion, and precede the &s;tandard of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> when it is brought out of the &s;eraglio, to be carried to the army, in order to in&s;ure victory to the Ottoman troops.</P>
<P>This &s;tandard is of green &s;ilk, and pre&s;erved in the trea&s;ury, from whence it is never brought, but to be carried to the army.

The infidels, for &s;uch there are, even among the true believers, pretend this relick is only an old pair of the prophet's breeches: but, it is certain, this holy water is dear enough, to tho&s;e who are favoured with it; and tho&s;e who di&s;pen&s;e it, know how to em|ploy the things of this world, and the &s;alvation of the world to come, to purpo&s;es of extortion.</P>

<P>Though the Grand Signor is obliged to be at very great expences, for the maintenance of &s;uch a nu|merous army, yet he derives very con&s;iderable ad|vantages from it; for he is heir to all his officers, who die without i&s;&s;ue; and if they leave daughters only behind them, he comes in for two-thirds of their effects.</P>
<P>Every part of the military e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Ottoman empire, at this hour, announces its decline; but none more &s;o, than the weak &s;tate of its marine. In former times, the Turki&s;h fleet was almo&s;t innu|numerable; but &s;ince the war of Candia, again&s;t the republic of Venice, which la&s;ted twenty-one years, no formidable fleet has been &s;ent to &s;ea by the Porte. The great, and repeated, lo&s;&s;es the Turks &s;u&s;tained, du|ring that war, gave birth to a &s;aying, familiar in the mouths of the Ottoman &s;ubjects, that "God made the land for the Turks, and the &s;ea for the Chri&s;tians."</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140">But the total de&s;truction of the marine force of the empire, was not accompli&s;hed till the la&s;t war again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians. It was re&s;erved for the brave Admiral <HI>Elphin&s;tone,</HI> who commanded a Ru&s;&s;ian &s;quadron in the Archipelago, to put a fini&s;hing hand to the &s;mall remains of power, the Turks po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at &s;ea. After having driven their fleet entirely out of the Archipelago, he pur&s;ued, and forced them to take &s;helter in the bay of Ce&s;mi, oppo&s;ite the i&s;le of Scios; there he obliged them to run their &s;hips on &s;hore, and, notwith&s;tanding the fire of the fort, burnt and de&s;troyed the greate&s;t part of their fleet. This action has rendered his name &s;o tremendous, to the Turks in tho&s;e parts, that I have heard them quiet their chil|dren, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> by telling them that <HI>Elphin&s;tone</HI> was coming.</P>
<P>It is true, after the peace, the indefatigable <HI>Ha&s;&s;en Bachi,</HI> the pre&s;ent high admiral, exerted him&s;elf in a &s;ignal manner to re&s;tore their marine; and, in three years, had forty &s;ail of the line at Con&s;tantinople, fit for immediate &s;ervice, be&s;ides &s;everal others, in dif|ferent ports of the empire; but, for want of ex|perienced officers, many of the&s;e have been wrecked in the Black Sea; &s;o that, at this time, they have not half the number of &s;hips, requi&s;ite to protect the coa&s;ts, and i&s;lands, of their exten&s;ive empire.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="141">The lieutenant to the high admiral, generally commands the fleet upon any expedition; or when it puts to &s;ea, to defend the coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>The captains of galleys are called Beys; they are all very rich, of the be&s;t families in Turkey, and generally are ba&s;haws with two tails; to whom are a&s;&s;igned the revenues of certain land, for their &s;alaries and the maintenance of their ve&s;&s;els; or el&s;e the Sul|tan gives them the government of &s;ome maritime place, &s;uch as Mitylene, Rhodes, Scios, &amp;c.

<P>They have al&s;o galliots, and other &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, called <HI>Cungiabai,</HI> almo&s;t like brigantines, calculated for the navigation of the Black Sea; becau&s;e they are light, and draw but little water. All the&s;e &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, are under the direction of the general of the galleys; who has for his &s;alary, the revenues of &s;ome of the mo&s;t valuable i&s;lands in the Archipelago. And it is very remarkable, the commanders of the&s;e inferior cla&s;&s;es of their marine, have the precedence, and are more re&s;pected than tho&s;e who command their fir&s;t-rate &s;hips, and their great fleets; if the rea&s;on is demanded, the mu&s;&s;ulmen reply, that it is founded on the antiquity of their galleys, or &s;ome &s;uch fable.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="142">Three different rates of &s;hips compo&s;e the Turki&s;h armaments. Tho&s;e of three decks, of cour&s;e, are the fir&s;t. The length of the&s;e is &s;ixty ells; and the ell of the ar&s;enal of Con&s;tantinople, contains two geometrical feet and a half. Each of the&s;e &s;hips carries 106 pieces of bra&s;s cannon: and, in order to render &s;uch an unwieldy machine a little manageable, the ma&s;ts and the &s;ails are of an enormous &s;ize. The crew of the&s;e &s;hips amounts to 1200 men, called Levants; be&s;ides 100 Greek &s;ailors, to manage the rigging. The wages of the Levants are 60 pia&s;tres, for &s;ix months; and, in the winter-months, they are di&s;charged; but they &s;erve, in expectation of pen|&s;ions for life, if they &s;ignalize them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The &s;econd rates are called <HI>Sultanas;</HI> they are thirty-four ells long, carry &s;ixty-&s;ix guns, 800 Le|vants, and 100 Greek &s;ailors. The third rates are called <HI>Caravalles;</HI> the&s;e mea&s;ure forty ells, are built like frigates, and mount from thirty-&s;ix, to forty-five pieces of cannon, their crew con&s;i&s;ts of 200 Le|vants, and thirty Greek &s;ailors.</P>
<P>The Ottoman &s;hips are, almo&s;t all, built by Greeks from the Archipelago; and though they are totally defective in theory, having no rules to go by, but tho&s;e of practice; yet they are &s;o well built, and their beauty and proportion &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, as not to
<PB N="142" REF="143">
be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, by any &s;hips, of the mo&s;t poli&s;hed na|tions in Europe. All that part of their &s;hips under water, is built of oak; but the upper parts are of fir, which renders them lighter, and le&s;s dangerous to the crews, in time of action; for fir does not fly off in &s;plinters, like oak. But the following circum|&s;tances contribute to render their &s;hips le&s;s durable than tho&s;e of other nations. The ma&s;ts are made of &s;everal pieces of wood, joined one above another, and &s;ecured with iron. The &s;ails are made with cot|ton, which take the wind better, and are more ma|nageable than linen; but they &s;oon tear, and wear out. The cordage is wretched; and, will neither la&s;t half the time, nor bear half the &s;tre&s;s of other ropes. The quantity of tallow, put about the cord|age, to &s;pare the labour of their &s;eamen, is incre|dible; and what they con&s;ume on the hull of a &s;hip, is in proportion of fifty pounds to one, u&s;ed on board the &s;hips of other countries; con&s;equently, this ar|ticle alone is an enormous charge, in the equipment of their fleets.</P>
<P>The marine ar&s;enal of Con&s;tantinople, is &s;ituated upon the port; in that part oppo&s;ite the city, where it begins to widen. One part of this ar&s;enal, is &s;et apart for large &s;hips, and the other for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. A very large dome was built, to &s;ecure them, while on the &s;tocks, from the injuries of the weather; but,
<PB N="143" REF="144">
either from cu&s;tom, or for convenience, the large &s;hips are always built in the open air; and the dome u&s;ed only for galleys, and galliots. All magazines, for the &s;ervice of the fleet, are kept within the en|clo&s;ure of this ar&s;enal; the circumference of which is about three Engli&s;h miles, and it is well &s;ecured from fire and thieves, by a &s;trong &s;tone wall. The magazines, the number of which is increa&s;ed very much, of late years, are covered with lead, and are full of all &s;orts of &s;tores.</P>
<P>It is the duty of a capitan <HI>Bachi,</HI> to take care to furni&s;h the&s;e magazines, with all the articles nece&s;|&s;ary for the con&s;truction, and equipment of the fleet; and to have a plentiful &s;tock in hand. If they were not kept always well &s;upplied, it would be con&s;idered as his fault; and he would certainly be depo&s;ed, and perhaps &s;trangled: becau&s;e wood, iron, and &s;ails, are to be had, in the greate&s;t abundance, at a &s;mall di&s;|tance from the capital. It is likewi&s;e, in his depart|ment to provide &s;ailors, in time of war; and, of the&s;e, there ought to be no want, as the city of Con|&s;tantinople, alone, can &s;upply 30,000; and the Archi|pelago is full of them. Yet during the la&s;t war, the capitan Bachi was obliged to compel arti&s;ans, and &s;hopkeepers, to &s;erve on board the Turki&s;h fleets; owing to the failure, on the part of government, in not having paid the wages of their &s;ailors, on former
<PB N="144" REF="145">
occa&s;ions: this circum&s;tance has contributed to the decline of the maritime &s;trength of the empire.</P>
<P>Another method, taken by the Porte, to &s;upply the want of &s;eamen, was, to oblige the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, to furni&s;h a quota of &s;hips and &s;ailors, according to ancient cu&s;tom. The &s;uccours, which government has a right to demand, from its de|pendencies, when a war breaks out, are,&mdash;Four &s;hips from Algiers, completely armed and manned; three from Tripoli; three from Tunis; and, from Eygpt, twenty-four Cajrines; which &s;erve as merchant &s;hips, in time of peace; but, in time of war, are fitted out as armed ve&s;&s;els, mounting fifty guns each, and having 600 men, far &s;uperior, in point of bravery, and &s;kill in manoeuvring a &s;hip, to any other &s;eamen, in the Ottoman &s;ervice. However, of all the&s;e &s;uc|cours, &s;carce any arrived during the la&s;t war; &s;o little was the re&s;entment, of an enfeebled empire, to be dreaded by its dependent governments.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Language and Learning.</HEAD>
<P>THE common language of the country, known by all ranks of people, is the Turki&s;h, which was, originally, a mixture of Arabic, Per&s;ian, and Greek. The Chri&s;tians, of different countries, re|&s;iding at Con&s;tantinople, and in the provinces of the Turki&s;h empire, have each of them a language peculiar to them&s;elves. For in&s;tance, the Greeks &s;peak both the Greek and Turki&s;h; and in the &s;ame manner, the Armenians conver&s;e in their maternal tongue, and in that of the Turks. The language of the Greeks of the pre&s;ent day, has &s;carcely any re&s;emblance to the ancient Greek tongue: it is a wretched jargon; and the true Greek of antiquity, is &s;o totally lo&s;t in Greece, that hardly &s;ix per&s;ons can be found in all the country, who know any thing of it. To the eternal di&s;honour of the Greeks, it is in the poli&s;hed Chri&s;tian kingdoms of Europe alone, that learned men are &s;killed in the ancient languages. But what is &s;till wor&s;e, the mi|&s;erable
<PB N="146" REF="147">
jargon of the modern Greeks, has taken &s;uch deep root, that books of all &s;orts are printed in it; which will effectually prevent the re&s;toration of their ancient tongue. The Jews commonly con|ver&s;e in Spani&s;h; and the Turks, having commercial connexions and daily intercour&s;e with this mixture of inhabitants, know a little of the language of each. At the Ottoman court, another language is &s;poken; which is that of the Per&s;ian. All commi&s;&s;ions and in|&s;tructions to the great officers of &s;tate, military com|manders, and governors of provinces, are written in this pure language, which they call <HI>Far&s;i.</HI></P>
<P>The confu&s;ion of languages in Con&s;tantinople, according to Lady <HI>M.</HI> mu&s;t be very great. In Pera, the &s;uburbs, &s;ays &s;he, they &s;peak Turki&s;h, Greek, Hebrew, Armenian, Arabic, Per&s;ian, Ru&s;&s;ian, Sclavonian, Wallachian, German, Dutch, French, Engli&s;h, Italian, Hungarian. The perpetual hearing of this medley of &s;ounds, produces a very extraor|dinary effect upon the people that are born here; for they learn all the&s;e languages at the &s;ame time, and without knowing any of them well enough to write or read them. There are very few men, women, or even children, here, that have not the &s;ame compa&s;s of words, in five or &s;ix of the&s;e languages. This may &s;eem almo&s;t incredible in this country, and takes off very much from the merit of our ladies, who
<PB N="147" REF="148">
&s;et up for &s;uch extraordinary geniu&s;es, upon the credit of &s;ome &s;uperficial knowledge of French and Italian.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h language, &s;ays <HI>Pey&s;onnel,</HI> is originally the &s;ame with the Tartarian, or language of Za|gathia, in which many books have been written. By the adoption of the Arabic and Per&s;ian, it is become one of the fine&s;t in the world. All copious languages have been formed in the &s;ame manner. The Arabic, which is an ocean, derives its origin from the Hebrew, in it&s;elf confined and barren.</P>
<P>The different characters are by no means left entirely to the choice of the writer; but are appro|priated, by cu&s;tom, to particular &s;pecies of compo|&s;ition. The <HI>Ne&s;kbi,</HI> u&s;ed in printing, is employed in works of &s;cience; the <HI>Tealik,</HI> in poetry; the <HI>Divani,</HI> in the firmans, or edicts of government, and epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence; the <HI>Sulus,</HI> for mottos, public in&s;criptions, &amp;c. He who is unable to write all the&s;e different characters, writes as well as he can; but if he intends to publi&s;h a book, pre&s;ent a memoir to a mini&s;ter, a petition to a great man, or a poem to his patron, he will take care to have them copied, by &s;ome profe&s;&s;ed writer, in the cha|racter a&s;&s;igned by cu&s;tom to the&s;e &s;everal u&s;es; in the &s;ame manner as with us, a per&s;on unable to
<PB N="148" REF="149">
write the law, or other hands, will hire &s;ome one to copy his writings in the cu&s;tomary character.</P>
<P>Scarce any thing can be &s;aid on the &s;ubject of literature which is &s;o much neglected at Con&s;tantino|ple, that there is but one library in the whole city, worthy of notice; and it is of very modern date, having been founded by <HI>Ragheb Bacha,</HI> who, after having been ba&s;haw of &s;everal provinces, at la&s;t became vi&s;ir, in which po&s;t he died. He was a man of genius, and wherever he travelled, made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to collect valuable books in every lan|guage, and upon mo&s;t &s;ubjects, whether written by Mahometans, Chri&s;tians, or Jews. This rich legacy he bequeathed to the public; and, together with the library, founded a &s;chool for the education of Turki&s;h boys. A Turki&s;h printing office has, likewi&s;e, been lately e&s;tabli&s;hed at Con&s;tantinople; which after great oppo&s;ition, obtained leave to print all kinds of books, except tho&s;e on matters of religion. Though the Turks are not men of &s;cience, to which their great legi&s;lator <HI>Mahomet,</HI> has forbid them to apply to, as tending to puff them up with vain pride; yet, as men of wit, they &s;urpa&s;s mo&s;t nations. There are no people any where to be met with, who can relate an amu&s;ing tale, with more grace and elegance. They likewi&s;e excel every other nation in the mar|row, pith, elegance, good &s;en&s;e, and ingenuity of
<PB N="149" REF="150">
their proverbs, which, adds the above author, are always the &s;ure&s;t te&s;t of the intellectual abilities of any people. Like the Italian <HI>improvi&s;atoris,</HI> they have their profe&s;&s;ional &s;peakers, who, in order to make their court to the great, undertake to carry on the conver&s;ation, and amu&s;e the company, on any &s;ubject whatever.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be thought, however, that the Turks are &s;o totally deficient in literature, as they have been repre&s;ented by many writers; and though they have neglected tactics, navigation, and military di&s;|cipline, yet they are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the elements of <HI>Euclid,</HI> all the philo&s;ophy of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and the entire works of <HI>Plato,</HI> who&s;e &s;urname of divine, they pre|&s;erve, and whom they &s;tile <HI>Filatoun el Lillabi.</HI> They have, likewi&s;e, among them a multitude of Turki&s;h, Per&s;ian, and Arabic books, on grammar, logic, me|taphy&s;ics, morality, hi&s;tory, a&s;tronomy, a&s;trology, and the cabala; on geography, phy&s;ic, chemi&s;try, alchemy, and medicine; on law, theology, and con|trover&s;y; with an infinity of poems, fables, moral tales, and romances.</P>
<P>The Turks have al&s;o their regular colleges, called <HI>Medre&s;&s;as,</HI> the &s;ame as with us. They contain, as we have ob&s;erved before, &s;cholars of all ages, from tho&s;e who are &s;o young, as to have made but little
<PB N="150" REF="151">
progre&s;s in literature, to the <HI>Sohtas,</HI> or &s;tudents ar|rived at years of maturity. The&s;e Sohtas, are a cla&s;s of literati, who devote them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of grammar, the Arabic language, rhetoric, philo|&s;ophy, their religious ceremonies, and juri&s;pru|dence. Some of them arrive at the fir&s;t dignities, while others remain in the &s;ubaltern places of <HI>Imans; Mutevellis,</HI> or admini&s;trators of the revenues of the mo&s;ques; <HI>Naibs,</HI> or fir&s;t clerks to the Mollahs.</P>
<P>According to the &s;trict rule of their public or|dinances, the profe&s;&s;ors of the law cannot be advanced to places of importance, unle&s;s they have fir&s;t been <HI>Sohtas,</HI> have gone through a cour&s;e of &s;tudy in the <HI>medre&s;&s;as,</HI> and have been advanced to the dignity of <HI>Muderris,</HI> or principal of the college, which is granted by Imperial diploma. The monarch can grant them writs, by which they are immediately advanced; but the u&s;ual forms mu&s;t always be &s;o far complied with, that the per&s;on then rai&s;ed, mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with diplomas of all the degrees through which he ought to have pa&s;&s;ed. Neverthele&s;s, the&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations have frequently occa&s;ioned great murmurs among the <HI>Ulemas,</HI> as they often oblige men of merit, who de&s;erve a more rapid advance|ment, to remain all their lives in a &s;ubaltern &s;tation.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="152"><HI>Bi&s;ani,</HI> in his remarks on the Turki&s;h literature, mentions one of their doctors, who had read the alcoran over twenty four thou&s;and times. He like|wi&s;e notices an Abb&eacute;, who publi&s;hed a treati&s;e on the literature of the Turks, with extracts of mo&s;t of the books in the public library at Con&s;tantinople; without knowing a &s;yllable of the Turki&s;h language. The method he took was curious; it was to make the dragoman read the titles, and different parts of each work to him, in Italian, while the Abb&eacute; wrote down his notes; and, notwith&s;tanding his ignorance of the Turki&s;h language, having had an ingenious dragoman to tran&s;late to him, the work is &s;aid not to have been without merit.</P>

<P>TO give our readers &s;ome idea of the origin of the Turki&s;h empire, it will not be ami&s;s to begin with an account of the founder of the Mahometan religion.</P>
<P>That <HI>Mahomet</HI> was the author of the Mu&s;&s;ulman faith, is a well known fact. He was born at Mecca, in Arabia Felix, in 571. His father, an Arabian Chief, dying while he was very young, his uncle &s;eized upon his patrimony, and made &s;everal attempts to have him taken off by poi&s;on, or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, which obliged young <HI>Mahomet</HI> to conceal him&s;elf under different di&s;gui&s;es, and pa&s;s a mi&s;erable life, till he had the good fortune to be taken into the &s;ervice of a rich widow, who afterwards married him. This event happened in the thirtieth year of his age, and he had the dexterity to conceal from his wife, an infirmity, which, had it been known, would have prevented his good fortune; he was
<PB N="157" REF="158">
&s;ubject to epileptic fits, and when he found them coming on, had made it a practice to withdraw him|&s;elf from her company, and from &s;ociety; in order, as he alledged, to pa&s;s his time in devotion. His wife being accu&s;tomed to the&s;e retirements, before marriage, he ea&s;ily made them &s;ub&s;ervient to his ambitious views afterwards. The fir&s;t object of his attention was to recover his paternal inheritance, and the knowledge he had acquired by frequent conver&s;e with the Chri&s;tians and Jews, made him conceive the bold project of becoming a legi&s;lator, and found|ing a new religion. The &s;pirit of the times was pe|culiarly favourable to his enterprize. The Arabs, grown cool, and relaxed, in the wor&s;hip of their idols, ever degenerated into athei&s;m. The Chri&s;tians were divided into &s;ects; per&s;ecuting each other, with brutal fury, for the glory of God; and &s;acrificing, to their common animo&s;ity, the inoffen&s;ive Jews, who retaliated their cruelties.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, <HI>Mahomet</HI> began his a&s;toni&s;h|ing career. His temporary &s;eclu&s;ions from his wife, and from the world, became more frequent; and he affected to lead a &s;olitary life, a&s;&s;umed an exemplary piety in his di&s;cour&s;e, and a con&s;tant addiction to prayer, meditation, and contemplation. When his wife, who became more inqui&s;itive and &s;uper&s;titious, &s;urprized him in one of his epileptic fits, as &s;oon as
<PB N="158" REF="159">
he recovered, he &s;olemnly prote&s;ted that the &s;plendid appearance of the angel Gabriel, who came to him, by the expre&s;s command of God, to declare his di|vine will, concerning the true religion, had entirely overpowered him. She, either actually deceived, or pretending to be &s;o, propagated a report that he was a prophet. His admirers began to increa&s;e; upon which he &s;poke more freely on the &s;ubject of his vi|&s;ions, and the revelations made to him, by the angel. In this impo&s;ture <HI>Mahomet</HI> was powerfully a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <HI>Sergius,</HI> a Greek prie&s;t, who took great pains to per|&s;uade his followers of the truth of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s prodi|gies; and, being full of novelty, they became his di&s;ciples. <HI>Mahomet</HI> finding his parti&s;ans daily in|crea&s;ing, boldly threw off the ma&s;k, and affirmed he had received a commi&s;&s;ion from God, to propagate his new religion by force of arms. And that he might e&s;tabli&s;h his temporal authority, on a firm ba&s;is, he made alliances with the chief inhabitants of Me|dina; to which place he had fled from the per&s;ecu|tions of his relations, and married the daughters of four of the principal noblemen; by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he took the field, with a numerous army of his di&s;|ciples, collected from the adjacent towns and villages, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Mecca.</P>
<P>The rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;es of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> excited the jea|lou&s;y of the neighbouring princes, who all declared
<PB N="159" REF="160">
them&s;elves his enemies. The Arabs of Syria were the fir&s;t to to take arms again&s;t him; but, before he undertook to &s;ubdue them, dreading the valour of the chri&s;tians, like an able politician, he entered into an alliance with them; by which he engaged not to mo|le&s;t them, in their civil and religious liberties; and they, on their part, agreed not to give any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the enemies of the mu&s;&s;ulmen.</P>
<P>By this treaty, <HI>Mahomet</HI> &s;ecured again&s;t any pow|erful oppo&s;ition, &s;aw him&s;elf at full liberty to a&s;&s;ume the &s;overeign power; and, in the cour&s;e of twenty years, had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee his religion embraced by &s;everal nations, and his empire aggrandized by the Saracens, who owned him for their ma&s;ter; and, being a powerful people, had conquered &s;everal pro|vinces in A&s;ia. <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s new dominions, therefore, took the title of the Saracen empire, by which it is known in hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>At the head of numerous armies, this mo&s;t enter|pri&s;ing, and &s;ucce&s;sful impo&s;tor &s;ubdued great part of Africa, many provinces in Europe, and &s;till more, in A&s;ia; and died, in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every earthly dignity, in the year 631, leaving his exten&s;ive ter|ritories to be governed by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. The title of Caliph, which had been be&s;towed on him, when he was inve&s;ted with the diadem at Mecca, in a li|mited
<PB N="160" REF="161">
&s;en&s;e, &s;ignified no more than high prie&s;t; but in his per&s;on, it comprehended the idea of King, Prie&s;t, and Prophet; and, as none of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors could &s;upport a claim to the&s;e three characters, an at|tempt was made to di&s;po&s;e of the temporal dignity, to one of his relations, he having left no &s;on; and the &s;piritual, to another. This occa&s;ioned a con|tention, which had nearly overthrown the new em|pire; at length <HI>Omar,</HI> one of his four generals, and favourites, whom he called the &s;word of God, was elected, by the army, to fill the Saracen throne, to whom the re&s;t of the competitors &s;ubmitted. After his death a fre&s;h di&s;&s;ention took place, concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; which, by degrees, weakened the em|pire, and laid the foundation of another revolution, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Turki&s;h, upon the ruin of the Saracen empire.</P>
<P>The glory of the Saracen empire ended with the reign of <HI>Watik,</HI> who &s;ubdued great part of Italy; pe|netrating, in the year 847, almo&s;t to the gates of Rome: but he was &s;ucceeded by a brother, who&s;e cruelty, and debauchery, rendered him &s;o odious, to his &s;ubjects, that inte&s;tine commotions took place, which terminated in the revolt of the mo&s;t di&s;tant provinces. And, in the end, the Mahometan reli|gion had three chiefs, at the head of different &s;ects, who completed the ruin of the Saracen empire. For
<PB N="161" REF="162">
the Caliphs of Bagdad, in 1082, in order to &s;upport the ancient government, called to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, a warlike people, from the extremity of Tartary, called Turks.</P>
<P>The Turks were a people who lived in ob&s;curity, without any &s;y&s;tem of government, and were but little known before the middle of the ninth century; when they made a formidable appearance at &s;ea, from the Ca&s;pian ports, and ravaged the coa&s;ts; they then laid wa&s;te Armenia, Georgia, and Mingrelia, and defeated the armies of the Per&s;ians, and the Saracens, En|couraged by the&s;e enterprizes, they invaded Thrace; and the emperors <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> and <HI>Romanus</HI> being unable to make head again&s;t them, were obliged to bribe them with large quantities of gold, to retire from their dominions: which they did, flu&s;hed with conque&s;t, and fixed their re&s;idence in the Turque&s;tan. In proportion as the&s;e Turks aggrandized them&s;elves, the Saracens degenerated, and were, at length to|tally &s;ubdued by the Turks; who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Per&s;ia, Babylon, Diarbeck, and Me&s;opotamia.</P>
<P>In 1096, they became &s;o formidabe, and extended their conque&s;ts &s;o far, as to approach the very gates of Con&s;tantinople. Such frequent, and powerful, irruptions &s;pread a general terror; and obliged the Greek emperors, and the Chri&s;tians inhabiting Pale&s;|tine,
<PB N="162" REF="163">
to apply for &s;uccour to the European powers; but more particularly to the Pope, from who&s;e influence, with the Chri&s;tian princes, they expected to obtain a military force, &s;uperior to that of the Turks. This application gave ri&s;e to the famous expedition to the holy land, decreed by the coun|cil of Clermont; the con&s;equence of which was, the taking of Jeru&s;alem, by the French, in 1099. Several expeditions, univer&s;ally known by the name of Cru&s;ades, &s;ucceeded the fir&s;t, and la&s;ted near two centuries, till the Chri&s;tians were totally &s;ub|dued by the Turks.</P>
<P>The Emperors of Con&s;tantinople, in tho&s;e days, were con&s;tantly involved in dome&s;tic di&s;cord. Scarce one of them died peaceably in their beds. A new mo|narch was no &s;ooner &s;eated on the throne, than he made the mo&s;t &s;trict &s;earch for the relations, and friends, of his predece&s;&s;or; whom he either ma&s;|&s;acred, or, exerci&s;ed &s;uch cruelties on their per&s;ons, as rendered them incapable of all the offices of life; and the&s;e tortures, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, were hardly at an end, before his own turn came, and him&s;elf, and his friends, &s;ubmitted to the &s;ame fate from his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or. An empire, &s;o turbulent, could not fail of being torn to pieces by civil faction, and rendered &s;o weak, as to promi&s;e an ea&s;y conque&s;t to any hero,
<PB N="163" REF="164">
in the Turki&s;h dominions, which were now extended to the neighbourhood of Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P><HI>Ottoman</HI> was the chief who&s;e genius di&s;po&s;ed him to watch every motion of the Greeks; and when their civil di&s;cords had produced a &s;tate of anarchy, he laid &s;iege to Con&s;tantinople, and took it by a&s;|&s;ault. After this revolution, he extended his domi|nions by conque&s;t, and thus became the founder of the Turki&s;h empire; which, at one time, was equally the terror, and admiration, of all Europe; as much as it is now an object of pity and contempt. In the year 1300, he took upon him&s;elf the title of Empe|ror of the Othmans, or Ottomans, calling the people after his own name. It is from this prince, that the pre&s;ent Grand Signor deduces his pedigree.</P>
<P>His re&s;idence he fixed at Yenge&s;cheri; and, ex|clu&s;ive of many other towns, in 1326 took Pru&s;a, in Bithynia, now called Bru&s;a, which his &s;on and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, <HI>Orchan,</HI> made the &s;eat of his empire.</P>
<P><HI>Othman</HI> was &s;ucceeded, by a race of the mo&s;t war|like princes mentioned in hi&s;tory. About the year 1357 they pa&s;&s;ed the Helle&s;pont, and took Adria|nople, which <HI>Amurath</HI> made the feat of his empire. It was this prince who in&s;tituted the corps of cavalry called <HI>Spahis,</HI> and divided among them the territories
<PB N="164" REF="165">
he had conquered. He was the fir&s;t mu&s;&s;ulman who &s;ubmitted to the operation of circumci&s;ion; which was performed upon him, in public, with great &s;o|lemnity. To this emperor al&s;o, the grand vi&s;irs are indebted, for the origin of their dignity, and un|limited power. His &s;on, and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, <HI>Bajazet,</HI> was very &s;ucce&s;sful, both in Europe and A&s;ia. He was a prince of the bolde&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;anguinary di&s;po|&s;ition of his time. To revenge the death of his fa|ther, he marched again&s;t the Bulgarians; and, with his own hands, &s;lew <HI>Eleazer,</HI> their prince, and gave the lands, in Bulgaria, to his cavalry. His conque&s;ts were afterwards &s;o rapid, and exten&s;ive, that it &s;eemed as if no ob&s;tructions could &s;et bounds to them; and hi&s;torians relate, that &s;uch were his own &s;entiments on that &s;ubject. But he was mi&s;taken; for <HI>Timur,</HI> or <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> emperor of the Tartars, marched again&s;t him, and gave him battle, on the &s;ame &s;pot where <HI>Pompey</HI> had formerly defeated <HI>Mithridates. Tamerlane,</HI> with an inferior army, totally defeated the Turks; and <HI>Bajazet,</HI> attempting to &s;ave him&s;elf by flight, was overtaken by the Tartarian cavalry; who conducted him to the tent of <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> where his haughty deportment, and in&s;olent language, fixed his future, &s;ingular fate. For being a&s;ked by his con|queror, how he would have di&s;po&s;ed of <HI>him,</HI> if the fortune of war had rever&s;ed their fate; an&s;wered, with &s;corn and bitterne&s;s, I would have put you in an

iron cage, and carried you in triumph, to make you the object of public deri&s;ion. With equal ju&s;tice then, &s;aid his conqueror, may I pa&s;s this &s;entence upon you; and accordingly, this cruel oppre&s;&s;or of nations, was enclo&s;ed in an iron cage, and allowed only &s;ufficient food, of the coar&s;e&s;t kind, to keep him alive. Tradition likewi&s;e informs us, that <HI>Ta|merlane</HI> mounted his hor&s;e, from the top of his cage, and obliged the wife of <HI>Bajazet</HI> to wait on him, at table, naked. The wretched captive, de&s;pairing at length of all hopes of liberty, in a fit of rage, &s;truck his head with &s;uch violence again&s;t the bars of his cage, that he put an end to his mi&s;erable exi&s;tence, in 1403.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> by declaring war one again&s;t another, left the Turks more powerful than ever; and though their career was checked, by the valour of the Venetians and Hungarians, they gra|dually reduced the dominion of the Greek empe|rors; and, after a long &s;iege, <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second took Con&s;tantinople, in the year 1454; the Greeks lo&s;ing all courage and di&s;cipline after the death of <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> their emperor, who was &s;lain in the a&s;&s;ault. <HI>Mahomet</HI> then cau&s;ed the head of the Greek emperor to be cut off, and carried it round the city, &s;tuck upon a &s;pear, to in&s;ult the wretched inhabitants. Three days after the city was taken, he made a tri|umphal
<PB N="166" REF="168">
entry into Con&s;tantinople; when he ordered proclamation to be made, that he &s;hould in future make it the place of his re&s;idence, and the capital of the Turki&s;h Empire. Thus, after an exi&s;tence of ten centuries, from its fir&s;t commencement under <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, ended the Greek empire, an event which had been long fore&s;een, and was owing to many cau&s;es; the principal one being the total de|generacy of the Greek emperors, their courts, and families; the di&s;like their &s;ubjects had to the popes, and the We&s;tern church, one of their patriarchs de|claring publicly to a Romi&s;h legate, "that he would rather &s;ee a turban, than the pope's tiara, on the great altar of Con&s;tantinople." But as the Turks did not exterminate, but only reduced, the nations to &s;ubjection; the remains of the ancient Greeks &s;till exi&s;t, particularly in Con&s;tantinople, and the neigh|bouring i&s;lands; where, though under grievous op|pre&s;&s;ions, they profe&s;s chri&s;tianity under their own patriarchs.</P>
<P>The Greeks having e&s;tabli&s;hed a new Imperial throne at Trebizond, the conqueror of Con&s;tanti|nople thought his victories incomplete, while any part of the Ea&s;tern empire remained in the hands of the Chri&s;tians; he therefore meditated the conque&s;t of this place, which the di&s;&s;entions among the European powers enabled him to accompli&s;h. The conque&s;ts
<PB N="167" REF="169">
of this emperor were &s;o very numerous, and exten|&s;ive, that he is reported by hi&s;torians, to have &s;ub|verted two empires, conquered twelve kingdoms, and taken two hundred cities. Shining accompli&s;h|ments, and dete&s;table crimes, appear to have been blended in his conduct. He had a &s;overeign con|tempt for all religions, and called the founder of his own, "the chief of a banditti." He, however, cul|tivated learning, and the polite arts; was &s;killed in many languages, and ma&s;ter of geography and hi&s;|tory. He likewi&s;e practi&s;ed drawing and painting, for his amu&s;ement; and invited <HI>Bellini,</HI> the Venetian painter, to his court. In fine, <HI>Mahomet</HI> might have rivalled the mo&s;t illu&s;trious heroes of antiquity, if his debaucheries, his licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and his cruelties, had not tarni&s;hed the lu&s;tre of his military glory, and fine accompli&s;hments. Some, of the many well atte&s;ted in&s;tances, of his &s;avage barbarity, are denied by <HI>Voltaire,</HI> and other hi&s;torians; but independent of his putting to death &s;everal captive princes, in violation of treaties of capitulation; his cutting off the whole hou&s;e of <HI>Notaras,</HI> becau&s;e that nobleman refu&s;ed to give up one of his daughters to his lu&s;t, and his ordering &s;eventeen of his pages to be ripped up, to di&s;cover which of them had eaten a melon, that had been &s;tolen from him, are &s;ufficient to make his memory dete&s;table.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="170">Such has been the origin and progre&s;s of the Turki&s;h empire; which, though it had its commence|ment many centuries back, does not appear to have acquired its pre&s;ent exten&s;ive dominion, and &s;eat of empire, till towards the latter end of the fifteenth century.&mdash;An empire evidently founded in conque&s;t; and where, though property may perchance be &s;acred, life &s;eems to have been of little value; as depending &s;olely on the will of the prince and his mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Next to <HI>Mahomet</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Solyman</HI> the &s;econd, better known in hi&s;tory by the title of <HI>Solyman</HI> the magnificent, &s;eems to have been the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of the Ottoman line of Emperors. He a&s;cended the throne in 1520. It was he who took the cele|brated i&s;land of Rhodes, which had been in the hands of the knights of <HI>St. John,</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> upwards of two centuries. His conque&s;ts were &s;o con&s;ider|able in A&s;ia, Africa and Europe, that his dominions extended from Algiers to the Euphrates, and from the boundaries of the Black Sea, to tho&s;e of Greece and Epirus.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torians have di&s;covered a &s;triking re&s;emblance between this prince, and the celebrated <HI>Charles</HI> V. Both were equally qualified for peace or war; and memorable for the great number of journies, &s;ieges, and battles, in which they were per&s;onally engaged.
<PB N="169" REF="171">
<HI>Solyman</HI> was undoubtedly the greate&s;t warrior, and <HI>Charles</HI> the able&s;t politician. There are likewi&s;e &s;ome other traits in the two characters totally di&s;&s;imi|lar. <HI>Charles</HI> was &s;incere, true to his engagements, and merciful to his captives, his &s;everity to the pro|te&s;tants excepted. <HI>Solyman,</HI> on the contrary, was capricious, a violator of treaties, and inhumanly cruel. After the victory of Mohatz, when he made all Hungary tributary to the Ottoman empire; fifteen hundred pri&s;oners, chiefly con&s;i&s;ting of Hungarian nobility, were placed in a circle, and upon a &s;ignal given by the &s;ultan, beheaded, almo&s;t at the &s;ame in|&s;tant, upon the field of battle. He likewi&s;e &s;acri|ficed <HI>Ibraham Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> one of his be&s;t generals, and an able &s;tate&s;man, to the vengeance of <HI>Roxalana,</HI> order|ing his throat to be cut in his pre&s;ence; and his of|ficers were often obliged to undertake impracticable enterprizes, in which they peri&s;hed mi&s;erably, from a dread of being put to an ignominious death, if they di&s;obeyed. One of his generals, to whom he had &s;ent to build a bridge over the <HI>Drave,</HI> returned him for an&s;wer, that it was impo&s;&s;ible. The emperor, firm in his re&s;olution, &s;ent him a long linen bandage, with the following words written upon it; "The em|peror <HI>Solyman,</HI> thy ma&s;ter, di&s;patches to thee the &s;ame courier thou has &s;ent to him; and orders thee to build the bridge over the <HI>Drave,</HI> without paying any regard to the difficulties that may occur in the execu|tion
<PB N="170" REF="172">
of it. He gives thee to under&s;tand likewi&s;e, that if the bridge is not fini&s;hed on his arrival, he will have thee &s;trangled with the piece of linen, which announces to thee his &s;upreme will.</P>
<P><HI>Solyman</HI> was the fir&s;t Ottoman emperor who made an alliance with the French; and it was the origin of a partiality, for that nation, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting at the Porte.</P>
<P>The beginning of the &s;eventeenth century, pre&s;ented a compound of ambition, cruelty, and lu&s;t, in the per&s;on of <HI>Amurath</HI> the third, who began his reign with a barbarous act of Turki&s;h fratricide, in cau&s;ing five of his brothers to be put to death in his pre&s;ence. He took advantage of an in&s;urrection in Per&s;ia, to &s;end 100,000 men to conquer that kingdom; and whil&s;t this &s;cene was pa&s;&s;ing in Per&s;ia, he &s;ent another army into Poland, which laid wa&s;te great part of that country; burning no le&s;s than 500 noblemen's &s;eats, be&s;ides &s;everal towns and villages. Every expedition, made by this tyrant, was marked with blood; till the very Jani&s;&s;aries, di&s;gu&s;ted with his cruelties, &s;et fire to Con&s;tantinople, and de&s;troyed above 150,000 hou&s;es; and then, a&s;&s;embling in a tumultuous man|ner, before the gates of the &s;eraglio, demanded the head of the high trea&s;urer. The whole city was in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, and impatiently expecting
<PB N="171" REF="173">
a revolution; when <HI>Amurath,</HI> who well knew his life and crown depended on his per&s;onal courage, bur&s;t forth from the palace, &s;abre in hand; and fell, with incredible fury, on the leaders of the revolt; killing &s;everal with his own hand, and &s;o intimidating the re&s;t, that they fled; and, &s;oon afterwards, &s;ubmitted to a &s;evere reform in their di&s;cipline, happy, at any rate, to obtain a pardon. His reliance upon the&s;e troops being re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, he made great prepara|tions for invading Poland and Moldavia; but was di|verted from this de&s;ign, by the powerful interce&s;&s;ion of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> The Chri&s;tians inhabiting Cro|atia were not &s;o fortunate; for <HI>Amurath</HI> made a dreadful &s;laughter of the&s;e wretched people, to the amount of &s;ixty-five thou&s;and.</P>
<P>Having now traced the origin and progre&s;s of this great empire, till it aro&s;e to its pre&s;ent grandeur, we &s;hall proceed to give &s;ome account of its admini&s;|tration, and the political maxims, by which it appears to be governed.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Turki&s;h empire, no atten|tion, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> is paid to age, or birth-right; the Turks thinking it &s;ufficient if, in their elections, they keep to the Ottoman family. Women, however, are entirely excluded from the Ottoman throne. The government is purely monarchical, but if the em|peror
<PB N="172" REF="174">
indulges not the humours of the mutinous Ja|ni&s;&s;aries, he is not only in danger of being depo&s;ed, but of even being put to death.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t care of an Ottoman prince, when he comes to the throne, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> is to let his beard grow; to which Sultan <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> added the dying of it black; in order that it might be more ap|parent on the fir&s;t day of his appearance, when he was to gird on the &s;abre; a ceremony by which he takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne; and which is equiva|lent to our coronation. The Per&s;ian monarch does the &s;ame. See the plate, page 87, vol. viii.</P>
<P>It is always performed by the Mufti, at the mo&s;que of Youb; a little village famed for its earthen wares, and its dairies; and &s;ituated near the bottom of the harbour, forming a kind of &s;uburb to the city. This ceremony takes place immediately on the &s;ultan's coming to the throne. All the &s;treets, from the &s;e|raglio to Youb, are lined on both &s;ides by Jani&s;&s;aries, in the habits and bonets of ceremony: but without arms, and with their hands cro&s;&s;ed before them.</P>

<PB N="173" REF="175">
who are of the lea&s;t con&s;equence; and who file off without order. They are all on hor&s;eback, and are each of them encircled by a number of valets on foot, according to the rank and fortune of their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ors of the law are remarkable by the largene&s;s of their turbans, and the &s;implicity of their hor&s;es trappings; but the Agha of the Jani&s;&s;aries, accompanied by his attendants, makes the mo&s;t &s;plen|did appearance of any of the great officers. Be&s;ides the number of valets, who &s;urround his hor&s;e, he is preceded by two rows of <HI>Tchorbadgi,</HI> or Colonels; who, on the right and left, march on foot before their general. The&s;e officers precede him in yel|low boots, each one with a white &s;taff in his hand, and a helmet on his head, embroidered with gold, and ornamented with a grand plume of feathers, after the Roman manner; forming a long lane of &s;uch cre&s;ts, at the bottom of which appears the Jani&s;&s;ary Agha, who over-tops all his numerous at|tendants. But an object really curious is, the dre&s;s of the <HI>Achetchi Bachi,</HI> who walks on foot, in the middle of the two rows of colonels, and only &s;ome few paces before his general. An enormous Dalma|tic of black leather, loaded with great knobs of &s;ilver, covers a kind of wai&s;tcoat likewi&s;e of leather, and no le&s;s &s;trangely ornamented. This latter is fa&s;tened
<PB N="174" REF="176">
on by a large girdle, with great hooks, and a cla&s;p which &s;u&s;tains two enormous knives, the handles of which almo&s;t entirely hide his face; while &s;poons, bowls, and other uten&s;ils of &s;ilver, hung by chains of the &s;ame metal, &s;carcely leave him the u&s;e of his legs. He is indeed &s;o loaded, that on all public occa&s;ions, which oblige this officer to wear this extraordinary dre&s;s, he is propped up by two Jani&s;&s;aries, who &s;up|port his ornaments.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tchaooche-Bachi,</HI> one of the mini&s;ters of the Porte, who&s;e office principally relates to civil affairs, is preceded by the bailiffs, of whom he is the chief; each of them bearing an o&s;trich's feather on the &s;ide of his turban. The <HI>Bo&s;tangi-Bachi</HI> is in like manner preceded by two rows of Bo&s;tangis, with their &s;taves in their hands; who&s;e red habits, and head-dre&s;&s;es, pre&s;ent to the eye a very agreeable uniformity. The&s;e different officers of the empire, as they pa&s;s along, &s;alute, on the right and left, the Jani&s;&s;aries drawn up on each &s;ide, who return the compliment by bowing; but pay this honour with much more re&s;pect to the turbans only of the Grand Signor, which are carried in &s;tate before the Sultan. Two of the&s;e head-dre&s;&s;es, ornamented with feathers, were intended at fir&s;t, only for a change, in&s;tead of that which the Emperor wears, if he thought proper; but this cu&s;tom, meant
<PB N="175" REF="177">
merely for convenience, has at length become a &s;ub|ject of o&s;tentation.</P>
<P>The&s;e turbans, placed on a kind of tripods, of a &s;carlet colour, are carried in the right hand, by two men on hor&s;eback, &s;urrounded by a great number of <HI>Tchoadars;</HI> and the&s;e officers are to incline the tur|bans, though but a little, to the right and left; while the Jani&s;&s;aries, by &s;even or eight at a time, make a profound reverence to &s;alute the Imperial plumes.</P>
<P>In this proce&s;&s;ion, not le&s;s curious to be &s;een than difficult to be de&s;cribed, the vi&s;ir and the mufti, both clad in white, the fir&s;t in &s;attin, and the &s;econd in cloth, walk on the &s;ide of each other, &s;urrounded by their attendants, and preceded by led hor&s;es, and the <HI>Chatirs,</HI> or footmen of the Grand Vi&s;ir. On the &s;ide of this mini&s;ter walk the <HI>Alay-Tchaooches,</HI> or Law-Serjeants, who keep their &s;ilver rods, hung round with little chains, and re&s;embling children's corals, in con&s;tant motion, with the noi&s;e of which he is at|tended quite into his palace. A covered chariot, rudely made, and ill carved, but richly gift, and containing a little &s;opha, commonly follows the mufti, to receive him when he is fatigued.</P>
<P>Afterwards come the Captains of the Body-Guards, and the principal and under equeries, who precede
<PB N="176" REF="178">
the led hor&s;es of the Grand Signor. The&s;e hor&s;es are covered with very rich trappings, which trail on the ground, and leave nothing to be &s;een but the head of that animal; the front of which is orna|mented by a large plume of heron feathers: they likewi&s;e each carry a hor&s;e's tail, hung to the throat band of the bridle; and a &s;abre on the &s;addle, with a mace pa&s;&s;ed through the circingle, both covered by a buckler. Each hor&s;e is led by two men on foot, who hold a leathern thong, fa&s;tened to the head of the animal. Two rows of <HI>A&s;&s;ekis,</HI> or detachments from the royal gardeners, immediately follow after; and a troop of <HI>Zulu&s;tchis,</HI> or Body-Guards, with &s;carlet helmets, and lances erect, walk, richly dre&s;&s;ed, in two rows, and precede the <HI>Pei&s;ks.</HI> The&s;e, clad after the Roman manner, carry the <HI>fa&s;ces</HI> &s;urmounted with a &s;ilver hatchet; and march before the Solacks, a body of left-handed men who guard the Sultan's per&s;on, and &s;o called from being obliged to draw their arrows with their left hand; the&s;e are armed with their bows and arrows, and bear rich helmets, ornamented with plumes of feather &s;haped like a fan, the extremities of which uniting, form two lines of the&s;e cre&s;ts, between which the Grand Signor pro|ceeds, alone, on hor&s;eback. The plumes he bears ri&s;e above this &s;uberb group, and his approach in|&s;pires a melancholy &s;ilence; the Jani&s;&s;aries bow, pro|foundly, until the line of feathers has entirely hid the
<PB N="177" REF="179">
Emperor from their &s;ight; while his Highne&s;s, on his part, has the goodne&s;s to return the &s;alute, by a &s;light motion of his head, to the right and left.</P>
<P>An infinite number of Tchoadars &s;urround and follow the Grand Signior. They encompa&s;s, at the &s;ame time, the <HI>Seliklar</HI> Aga; who carries the Im|perial &s;abre on his &s;houlder, and is clad in a habit of cloth of gold; which is the only Turki&s;h dre&s;s that fits the &s;hape.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ki&s;lar</HI> Aga next appears, or chief of the eunuchs, followed by <HI>Ka&s;nadar</HI> Aga, or keeper of the privy-pur&s;e, who clo&s;es the proce&s;&s;ion, and di&s;|tributes money to the people, running after him in crowds. The <HI>Capidgilar Kiaya&s;&s;ay,</HI> or Captain of the Guards, and the <HI>Bo&s;tangi-Bachi,</HI> who precede the Grand Signior whenever he goes in public, are obliged, on his return to the &s;eraglio, to allight at the fir&s;t court, and go before his Highne&s;s. When they approach it, they increa&s;e their pace, pro&s;trate them&s;elves at his hor&s;es feet, and introduce him into the &s;econd court, walking before him to the place where he allights, and is received by the officers of the interior apartment.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Mahometan doctors, the expounders of the Turki&s;h law, have declared that the &s;overeign
<PB N="178" REF="180">
is above the laws, and may revoke his promi&s;es, and even his oaths, when he di&s;covers they are prejudicial to his ab&s;olute power, and unlimited will. Each monarch, at his coronation, &s;wears he will be the defender of the Mahometan religion, of its rights, cu&s;toms, and ceremonies; and of all the laws of <HI>Ma|homet.</HI> There are, however, other doctors of the Mahometan law, who refu&s;e to acknowledge the power of the &s;overeign to judge, and decide in matters of religion; and they are nearly the &s;ame ar|guments, which the Romi&s;h theologi&s;ts urge, again&s;t the Imperial and royal authority.</P>
<P>The following anecdote, re&s;pecting this &s;ubject, merits our attention. In the reign of Sultan <HI>O&s;man,</HI> a mufti, in giving judgment upon an affair which be|longed to religion, made u&s;e of words &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the pope of Rome, to expre&s;s his divine authority and infallibility. But when the &s;entence was pro|nounced to that excellent monarch, he annulled it; "I will not be a &s;chi&s;matic, by acknowledging two popes. I know there is one at Rome, but I will not allow of another at Con&s;tantinople."</P>
<P>In the following relation likewi&s;e of a fact, from Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> of but little importance in it&s;elf, yet &s;in|gular, and worthy to be remarked, we &s;hall &s;ee Sul|tan <HI>O&s;man,</HI> the late &s;ultan, notwith&s;tanding this arbi|trary
<PB N="179" REF="181">
power a&s;&s;igned to him, by the doctors of the Mahometan law, obliged to employ the authority of an officer, of very inferior rank, with a refractory Jani&s;&s;ary, who refu&s;ed obedience to his orders.</P>
<P>This Jani&s;&s;ary being drunk, and pur&s;ued by the guard, who, as we before ob&s;erved, have commonly no other arms but large &s;ticks, availed him&s;elf of the &s;uperiority which his Yatagan, (a kind of knife very long, and bent, which &s;erves as a &s;abre gave over them, to defend him&s;elf like a lion. He had already driven &s;everal of his enemies from the field; and fa|tigued by his exertions, prepared for a new engage|ment, by re&s;ting on the &s;teps of a <HI>Khan,</HI> whil&s;t the guard converted the attack into a blockade. The Grand Signior, who frequently went about the city in di&s;gui&s;e, but which conceals him from no one, hap|pening to be on the &s;pot, approached the offender, told him to lay down his weapons, and &s;urrender him&s;elf pri&s;oner; but nothing could move our hero, who even dared to look his &s;overeign carele&s;sly in the face, and threaten the fir&s;t per&s;on who &s;hould approach him.</P>
<P>The Sultan then a&s;ked him to what <HI>Orta</HI> he be|longed, and, upon his telling him, &s;ent for his of|ficer, who pre&s;ently arrived. "Di&s;arm that man," &s;aid the Grand Signior, "and conduct him to the ca&s;tle." The officer directly takes off his girdle.
<PB N="180" REF="182">
This girdle is of copper, and weighs fifteen pounds; with which the officers may knock down, or kill, any Jani&s;&s;ary. The &s;oldiers re&s;pect this in&s;ignia of rank very much, in tho&s;e who wear it; for though of an in|ferior order, they have great authority. Advancing therefore, towards the rebel, with it in his right hand, while he held out to him his left, he &s;aid, fellow &s;oldier, give me your weapon and follow me; which he imme|diately did, with an air of the mo&s;t humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. So much more influence will prejudice always have, than fear; and more power, than ever de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;ultan was &s;oon after obliged to pay a tri|bute to popular cu&s;tom, of which he was him&s;elf the victim. The art of the phy&s;ician had, invain, endea|voured to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the health of that prince; at the &s;ame time that the maxims of government concealed his indi&s;po&s;ition. At length, his di&s;order increa&s;ing, he was obliged to &s;hut him&s;elf up in his palace, and re&s;erve his &s;trength, to appear every Friday at the mo&s;que. This public ceremony, which cu&s;tom has con&s;ecrated, may not be neglected without exciting great di&s;turbances, among the &s;oldiers and the people.</P>
<P>The contradiction which appears, at fir&s;t view, in a law that requires &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch a cu&s;tom, from a per&s;on &s;o de&s;potic as the &s;ultan, will vani&s;h, if we con&s;ider that it is nece&s;&s;arily dictated, by the de&s;|poti&s;m
<PB N="181" REF="183">
of the multitude; which is the object of per|petual dread to arbitrary power. Secluded from the public eye, in the impenetrable apartments of his &s;e|raglio, the &s;ight of him alone can prove his exi&s;tence. It will likewi&s;e be perceived, that without this pre|caution, a vi&s;ir, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ufficient art to terrify, or corrupt, two or three per&s;ons, after the death of his ma&s;ter, might conceal it long enough, to bring about &s;ome revolution in the government.</P>
<P>It was not therefore without exciting &s;ome very loud murmurs, that Sultan <HI>O&s;man</HI> neglected, one Fri|day, to appear in public at the mo&s;que; and in order to appea&s;e the di&s;turbances, that this mi&s;&s;ion had oc|ca&s;ioned, he determined to go the Friday following, with the u&s;ual ceremonies, to that of Sancta Sophia, which is neare&s;t the &s;eraglio; notwith&s;tanding the ex|treme &s;tate of weakne&s;s and languor, to which his di&s;order had reduced him. This prince on his re|turn, &s;carce able to keep his &s;eat on his hor&s;e, though &s;upported by his attendants who &s;urrounded him, fainted away, between the two gates, which divide the courts of the &s;eraglio, and died in a few minutes after he was brought into the palace.</P>
<P>A book of the laws of <HI>Mahomet</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hes as a maxim of religion, that mu&s;&s;ulmen not only may, but ought to, violate, and cancel, any treaties; detri|mental
<PB N="182" REF="184">
to the intere&s;t of the empire, or of their re|religion. It was in virtue of this maxim, that <HI>Ma|homet&punc;</HI> obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege of <HI>Mecca,</HI> and make peace with its inhabitants, came upon them afterwards by &s;urprize, and took the city in violation of treaty. Being a&s;ked by <HI>Abubeker,</HI> his di&s;ciple and general, why he did not keep his word, which he had &s;worn to, when he &s;igned the treaty of peace; he an&s;wered, he had acted in that manner, to teach his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, by his example, that no treaties were to be kept, when the promulgation of his holy religion, or the exten|&s;ion of the empire, required they &s;hould be broke through.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Ottoman hi&s;tory abounds with ex|amples of Turki&s;h perfidy to Chri&s;tian princes. One only of which we will mention, as related by hi&s;|torians; it being more memorable than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>A treaty of peace and friend&s;hip, in 1606, was concluded, &s;igned, &s;ealed and publi&s;hed, between <HI>Achmet</HI> the Fir&s;t, and <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the Second, Empe|ror of Germany. While the Plenipotentiaries of the Porte, and tho&s;e of the Emperor, were &s;till at Pe&s;t, oppo&s;ite to Buda, con&s;ulting together, in order to put the la&s;t hand to &s;ome regulations ari&s;ing out of the treaty; and at the very moment when the Turki&s;h mini&s;ters, from the Porte, were giving a public din|ner,
<PB N="183" REF="185">
to tho&s;e from the Emperor, the Turki&s;h garri|&s;on in Buda, imagining, that at &s;uch a time, they &s;hould find the walls of Pe&s;t defencele&s;s, &s;allied out, and attempted to take the town by &s;urprize; the vi|gilance of the German troops, however, who&s;e of|ficers &s;u&s;pected &s;ome perfidy on the part of the Turks, prevented their ba&s;e de&s;ign from taking effect, and they were repul&s;ed with very con&s;iderable lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior is &s;ucce&s;&s;or, both to the Cali|fat, and the chief of the military government. This de&s;poti&s;m, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> is founded on the alcoran, and the interpretation of that book is exclu&s;ively po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Ulemas. Every thing mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the law, and every thing mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the &s;ove|reign. The&s;e two powers have the &s;ame &s;ource, and it is ea&s;y to perceive the di&s;agreement and conten|tion which mu&s;t ari&s;e, &s;ince their right is equal, and their intere&s;ts different.</P>
<P>In this pa&s;&s;age, &s;ays <HI>Pey&s;onnel,</HI> Baron <HI>Tott</HI> de&s;troys that compleat and dreadful de&s;poti&s;m, again&s;t which he declaims. As &s;oon as there exi&s;ts, between the de&s;|pot and the people, an intermediary body who&s;e au|thority is equal, though its intere&s;ts are different; if this body be the depo&s;itary, the interpreter of the law, to which the &s;overeign is obliged to &s;ubmit, no le&s;s than the meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects; and if this
<PB N="184" REF="186">
body, and the de&s;pot, are obliged to fear and re&s;pect each other, de&s;poti&s;m can no longer exi&s;t. And though it be true, as is a&s;&s;erted by the Baron, that the monarch may with a &s;ingle word, bani&s;h, or even put to death, the mufti, and all tho&s;e of his body who di&s;plea&s;e him; it is equally true, that the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the law may, in an in&s;tant, by &s;editious di&s;|cour&s;e, or offering <HI>Yaftas,</HI> or papers, as is practi&s;ed, to the mo&s;ques, or in other public places, rai&s;e the people, and dethrone, or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the &s;overeign. Several muftis who have been bani&s;hed, have been the occa&s;ion of greatly alarming the monarch. The famous Mufti <HI>E&s;&s;ad</HI> Effendi was in bani&s;hment, when from his country-hou&s;e on the Bo&s;phorus, he excited tho&s;e riots again&s;t Sultan <HI>Mahmoud,</HI> which effected the de&s;truction of the Ki&s;ler Aga, Seuleiman Aga, and the Armenian; nor would the emperor him&s;elf have e&s;caped, had he not in&s;tantly determined to &s;a|crifice tho&s;e favourites.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on in rank, next to the &s;ultan, is the Grand Vi&s;ir, or prime mini&s;ter; his power is un|limited, and his &s;tation the highe&s;t in the empire. The Turks call him <HI>Vizir-Azemt,</HI> which &s;ignifies chief of the council, or vicar of the empire.</P>
<P>The &s;eal upon which is engraved the name of the great &s;eal, is in his cu&s;tody; and he always
<PB N="185" REF="187">
wears it in a little pur&s;e, &s;u&s;pended about his neck. In con&s;equence of this tru&s;t, he partakes of the &s;o|vereign authority; for, by means of the impre&s;&s;ion of this &s;eal, all the orders he i&s;&s;ues, and which are dependant only on his will and plea&s;ure, are in&s;tantly executed.</P>
<P>This office was in&s;tituted by Sultan <HI>Amurath</HI> II. as we have already ob&s;erved, to reward one of his generals, who had conquered Adrianople. By creating this office, he deputed to him the &s;overeign authority, as to the executive part of government, and from that time, it has been handed down to our day, with &s;ome alterations, which &s;hall be noticed in their proper place.</P>
<P>The Grand Vi&s;ir's court and his &s;uite are very nu|merous. More than a thou&s;and per&s;ons attend him, when he goes to the Divan; he is always a ba&s;haw of three tails. The income he draws from the royal trea&s;ury is very moderate, the &s;alary being only 20,000 Turki&s;h pia&s;tres; but from other re&s;ources he ama&s;&s;es immen&s;e riches. Every ba&s;haw, on his fir&s;t appointment to a government, is obliged to pay a con&s;iderable &s;um to the Grand Vi&s;ir, and that the government of a rich province, may not be ex|changed for one of le&s;s value, the ba&s;haws, likewi&s;e, make him annual pre&s;ents, the Grand Vi&s;ir having
<PB N="186" REF="188">
always &s;ome political pretext for frequent changes of the governors of provinces. When a ba&s;haw of three tails dies, his effects are tran&s;ported to the &s;eraglio, and thrown into the private trea&s;ury of the Grand Signior, but they pa&s;s fir&s;t through the hands of the Grand Vi&s;ir, who generally takes care to appro|priate a con&s;iderable part to him&s;elf. In &s;hort, all per&s;ons who have any bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act with the Porte, cannot di&s;pen&s;e with the e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom of making &s;ome valuable pre&s;ent to this officer.</P>
<P>It is computed, likewi&s;e, that there are 12,000 common pro&s;titutes in Con&s;tantinople, who pay a gold ducat per week, for liberty to pur&s;ue their in|famous commerce; and this tribute is divided be|tween the Grand Vi&s;ir, the Bo&s;tangi Ba&s;haw, and the Agha of the Jani&s;&s;aries. All the public hou&s;es of Galata, Pera, and the banks of the canal of the Black Sea, pay almo&s;t as much as the common women; and this impo&s;t belongs &s;olely to the Vi&s;ir. Be&s;ides the&s;e means of adding to his yearly income, he has other methods of extorting money; &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to form an exact calculation of his revenues, as they depend &s;o much on the di&s;po&s;ition of the per&s;on who holds this high office.</P>

<P><PB N="187" REF="190"><HI>Darandali-Haggi Mahmet</HI> Ba&s;haw, who was Grand Vi&s;ir, under the late &s;ultan, only for about a year and an half, ama&s;&s;ed, within that time, &s;ix millions of Turki&s;h pia&s;tres, be&s;ides jewels, rich &s;tuffs, and other valuable effects; the con&s;equence of which was, that his immen&s;e riches were &s;eized by the &s;ultan, who never &s;uffers his vi&s;ir to be guilty of great extortions, but that he may confi&s;cate the plunder all at once, under the colour of public ju&s;|tice.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of putting the Turks to death becau&s;e they were too rich, is now laid a&s;ide; &s;o that a Grand Vi&s;ir who gives up his trea&s;ures quietly, is only di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, or, perhaps, bani&s;hed to &s;ome i&s;land of the Archipelago.</P>
<P>The authority and powers of the Grand Vi&s;ir, are not &s;o exten&s;ive as in former reigns; the chiefs of the black eunuchs, having gained the a&s;cendant, owing to the frequent acce&s;s they have to the &s;ultan, who pa&s;&s;es much of his time in the harem. He is not permitted, as formerly, to put per&s;ons to death, without the &s;ultan's orders. In former reigns, the Grand Vi&s;ir beheaded the ba&s;haws of provinces, and &s;ometimes even the favourites of their monarchs, without their knowledge. Another lo&s;s the Vi&s;irs have &s;u&s;tained, is, the privilege of opening all let|ters
<PB N="188" REF="191">
from the generals of armies, and governors of provinces, and only imparting &s;o much of their con|tents as they thought proper; by which means they had tho&s;e officers entirely under their direction, but this dangerous cu&s;tom is now entirely aboli&s;hed, and the &s;ultan obliges them to &s;end all letters upon public affairs, to the feraglio, where they are examined by the Ki&s;ler Agha, and the Grand Vi&s;ir is as ignorant of their contents, as the &s;ultans were formerly; and only receives implicit orders to an&s;wer them, in &s;uch and &s;uch a manner, without knowing any thing fur|ther.</P>
<P>The Vi&s;ir &s;till retains the right of appeal from all other tribunals of ju&s;tice; and for this purpo&s;e he comes to the divan twice a week, attended by all his own officers, and by tho&s;e belonging to the other tribunals; he, likewi&s;e, holds a divan, and ad|mini&s;ters ju&s;tice in his own hou&s;e. In the general divan, where he is pre&s;ent, no magi&s;trate, or judge, is allowed to &s;it down, except the chief ju&s;tices of Romelia and Natolia. The&s;e two have a power of pa&s;&s;ing their own &s;entences, in pre&s;ence of the vi&s;ir, but he can, likewi&s;e, annul them, as &s;oon as they are pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>All petitions pre&s;ented to the Grand Signior, mu&s;t be given to the vi&s;ir, but tho&s;e complaining of his

<P>The Spahis and Jani&s;&s;aries cannot be puni&s;hed by the Grand Vi&s;ir, unle&s;s their commanders in chief give their con&s;ent: a revolt would be the con&s;e|quence of acting otherwi&s;e. The Grand Vi&s;ir has always a <HI>Kiaga,</HI> or lieutenant, which is a very im|portant po&s;t, and mu&s;t be filled by a per&s;on of great capacity and experience, who is able to give the be&s;t advice to his principal.</P>
<P>When the vi&s;ir gives audience to amba&s;&s;adors and foreign mini&s;ters, he is &s;eated upon a corner of the Imperial &s;opha, alone; at his right hand, &s;tands the <HI>Reis Effendi,</HI> or principal &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and on his left the Kiaga; the foreign mini&s;ter is &s;eated oppo&s;ite the vi&s;ir, upon a &s;tool.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Grand Vi&s;ir gives audience to the foreign mini&s;ters at the ar&s;enal, or at one of the &s;ultan's country palaces, in which ca&s;es, neither

<P>Being inve&s;ted almo&s;t with &s;overeign authority, he often heads the army, in room of the Sultan; and is there idolized by the &s;oldiery. Great as this officer may appear in the eyes of his people and exalted as he may be in his own eyes, the grand vi&s;ir met with a rebuff from <HI>Charles</HI> XII. of Sweden. This mo|narch having taken part with the Turks, again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians, and being defeated by the Czar, at the battle of Pultawa, in 1709, he fled into Turkey; the Turks renewed the war with the Ru&s;&s;ians and the Poles, and coming into the grand vi&s;ir's camp at the fields of Pruth; and entering his tent, ju&s;t at the time the vi&s;ir had &s;igned the articles of peace, between Ru&s;&s;ia and Turkey; and &s;eeing that his intere&s;ts had had been entirely neglected. he reproached the vi&s;ir in very violent terms, for not having drawn more ad|vantage from the chance of war, and taken the Czar pri&s;oner, when he had him in his power. The vi&s;ir replied, with an imperious air, that if all the Chri&s;|tian monarchs were to be kept pri&s;oners in Turkey, and thus kept ab&s;ent from their &s;tates, who would there be to govern? Alluding to <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> King of Poland, then a pri&s;oner in Turkey; and <HI>Charles</HI> fly|ing to the Turki&s;h camp for protection. The Swedi&s;h monarch felt the &s;ting of this remark; and, looking
<PB N="191" REF="194">
on the vi&s;ir with indignation, entangled his &s;purs in the vi&s;ir's robes, and throwing him&s;elf on a &s;opha, rent them to the bottom.</P>
<P>When the grand vi&s;ir makes a campaign, all the re|cords of chancery, and the archives dependent upon it, are tran&s;ported with him, and make part of his baggage; this &s;trange cu&s;tom is &s;till kept up, notwith|&s;tanding the inconvenience they have found from it; by the lo&s;s of all their writings, when they were obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Vienna, and retreat with the utmo&s;t precipitation. During the ab&s;ence of the grand vi&s;ir with the army, a &s;ub&s;titute is appointed at Con&s;tantinople, who&s;e authority however is very in|con&s;iderable; for, as the public regi&s;ters are in the vi&s;ir's camp, he cannot decide any important cau&s;e, without &s;ending to con&s;ult him for precedents. This &s;ub&s;titute is called the <HI>Kaimacan,</HI> and his admini&s;tra|tion is only provi&s;ional; for the moment the vi&s;ir re|turns, it cea&s;es; and the per&s;ons holding this office, are &s;trictly forbidden to mention publicly, that they have been <HI>Kaimacans;</HI> or to &s;peak of the affairs of their admini&s;tration. If in time of war, whil&s;t the grand vi&s;ir is at a di&s;tance, the Sultan &s;hould be in|clined to leave Con&s;tantinople, two <HI>Kaimacans</HI> are ap|pointed; one to attend on his per&s;on, and the other to remain in the city: in which ca&s;e there are likewi&s;e two &s;eparate admini&s;trations. This event happened
<PB N="192" REF="195">
when Sultan <HI>Mahomet</HI> IV, fixed his re&s;idence at Sa|lonica, during the war of Candia.</P>
<P>There were formerly &s;ix vi&s;irs, be&s;ides the Grand Vi&s;ir, and they were called Vi&s;irs of the bench; they made a part of the cabinet council, and delivered their &s;entiments freely, without being under any dread or controul of the grand vi&s;ir. In the reign of Sul|tan <HI>Achmet</HI> III. his Grand Vi&s;ir, <HI>Ibrahim</HI> Ba&s;haw &s;uppre&s;&s;ed them, under pretext of economy, but in reality, that he might not be &s;ubject to be oppo&s;ed by them in the council; and the better to &s;ilence the pre|ten&s;ions of tho&s;e who were then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e dignities; he gave them lucrative appointments, at a di&s;tance from the capital, which indemnified them for their lo&s;s of power; but a revival of their office had been frequently in agitation, which induces us to no|tice them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Defterdar</HI> is the high trea&s;urer of the empire; an office totally di&s;tinct from that of trea&s;urer of the &s;eraglio. The <HI>Defterdar</HI> collects all the revenues of the empire, by his proper officers, of whom he has a numerous train, and is obliged to &s;upply all the demands of the &s;tate, as well in time of war as in peace; his utmo&s;t attention therefore, is directed to the improvement of the revenues, and the dimi|nution of the expences of the empire. When the
<PB N="193" REF="196">
high trea&s;urer is a bold enterprizing man, he is ca|pable of doing much mi&s;chief throughout the whole empire; and, if he be di&s;hone&s;t, the con&s;equences are &s;everely felt by the people. In the year 1750, a defterdar, who was a native of Georgia, and had ri&s;en to that employment from being a &s;lave, fled from Con&s;tantinople, attended only by two dome&s;tics, and one of his women; the trea&s;ures he took with him con&s;i&s;ted of 28,000 pur&s;es, each pur&s;e containing 300 Turki&s;h pia&s;tres, and was never heard of more.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reis Effendi</HI> has a double employment, being both &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and chancellor of the empire. All the affairs of foreign princes pa&s;s through his hands. His employments are the mo&s;t lucrative of any in the &s;tate; except that of the Grand Vi&s;ir. He i&s;&s;ues all diplomas for the inve&s;titure of lands, governments, and other public offices throughout the empire. No &s;hip, of any nation, can leave the port of Con&s;tantinople, without his permi&s;&s;ion in writing; which, by the Turki&s;h tariff, co&s;ts five pia&s;tres. This revenue alone is very con&s;iderable, owing to the pro|digious population of the city; and the great trade it carries on with all the nations of A&s;ia, Africa, and Europe. The perqui&s;ites of the chancery are like|wi&s;e immen&s;e, ari&s;ing from the bu&s;ine&s;s he tran&s;acts with all the provinces of the empire; &s;o that if the <HI>Reis Effendi</HI> is a covetous man, he may ama&s;s a&s;to|ni&s;hing
<PB N="194" REF="197">
trea&s;ures, even with a fair character; but if he be di&s;hone&s;t, he has a thou&s;and ways of adding to his lawful emoluments by extortions. But notwith|&s;tanding the great influence, and authority of his em|ployments, they do not entitle him to a place in the divan, nor in the cabinet council; unle&s;s the bu&s;ine&s;s before them concerns his department.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ni&s;&s;angi</HI> is commonly under&s;tood to be the keeper of the great &s;eal, though in fact it is always in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the grand vi&s;ir; but the <HI>Ni&s;&s;angi</HI> writes, with his own hand, the cypher containing the name of the reigning monarch; which mu&s;t be put to every order, or grant, from the Sultan; without which it is null and void. The di&s;patches and public papers, of &s;uch an exten&s;ive empire, mu&s;t be almo&s;t numberle&s;s, and the <HI>Tura,</HI> or cypher, is taxed according to the importance of the papers; tho&s;e of the lea&s;t con&s;e|quence paying &s;even pia&s;tres. He attends at the royal divan, and his place is on a collateral bench, at the right hand of the grand vi&s;ir.</P>
<P>The <HI>Te&s;keregi</HI> is a kind of vice-chancellor, an of|fice of great importance. He has all the regi&s;ters of the chancery, and all writings, belonging to that of|fice, in his cu&s;tody; and it is his duty to &s;ee that all firmans, or royal mandates, are well written and ac|cording to rule. He is therefore, re&s;pon&s;ible to the
<PB N="195" REF="198">
<HI>Reis Effendi</HI> for the diligence, fidelity, and di&s;patch, of his &s;ubaltern officers, who are very numerous; and con&s;tantly employed in the offices belonging to the chancery. The greate&s;t &s;ecrets of &s;tate, and the mo&s;t private conferences, are imparted to him; he is even called upon, occa&s;ionally, to give his opinion on very weighty affairs; though he is not obliged to it by his office, and his advice is often followed. He com|monly &s;ucceeds the <HI>Reis Effendi</HI> when a vacancy hap|pens, either by death, or the removal of that officer. His income depends, in a great mea&s;ure, upon the <HI>Reis Effendi;</HI> and is, more or le&s;s, according to the bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted in the chancery.</P>
<P>The governors of the provinces are divided into three cla&s;&s;es. The <HI>Beglier-beys,</HI> the <HI>Ba&s;haw-beys,</HI> and the <HI>Sangiacks.</HI> Their rank is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the number of hor&s;e's tails that are borne before them, as marks of honour, in the nature of &s;tandards, or en&s;igns.</P>
<P>The <HI>Beglier-beys</HI> have three; the <HI>Ba&s;haw-beys</HI> two; and the <HI>Sangiacks</HI> one. It is a vulgar error to &s;ay, Ba&s;haw of three tails; for that dignity belongs only to the <HI>Beglier-beys,</HI> who are princes over princes; and far &s;uperior to ba&s;haws. The hor&s;es' tails are as much a mark of honour, as any order, civil or mili|tary, in&s;tituted by any of the other European &s;ove|reigns;
<PB N="196" REF="199">
but the account of its origin being little known, &s;ome modern writers have turned it into ri|dicule; while others have written very ignorantly on this &s;ubject. I &s;hall therefore fir&s;t de&s;cribe the &s;tan|dard, and then give an account of its in&s;titution.</P>
<P>It con&s;i&s;ts of a long &s;ub&s;tantial pole, on the &s;um|mit of which is fixed a leaden ball doubly gilt, to which are fa&s;tened a number of hor&s;es' tails, denoting the rank of the governor; and it is adorned with banners which de&s;cend a con&s;iderable length from the ball, and float in the air.</P>
<P>It is as ancient as the time of <HI>Abubeker,</HI> who hav|ing lo&s;t a battle in Syria, was abandoned by his troops, who fled on all &s;ides; when one of his offi|cers, who&s;e pre&s;ence of mind was equal to his valour, hit upon an expedient to rally the di&s;per&s;ed forces. For this purpo&s;e he took a long pole, and having no|thing proper to fa&s;ten on it, as a &s;ignal to be &s;een at a di&s;tance, he cut off his hor&s;e's tail, and having fa&s;|tened it on the top of his pole, he kept waving it in the air; at the &s;ight of this &s;ignal, which the Maho|metans con&s;idered as a token of &s;ome favourable turn in their affairs, they made the be&s;t of their way to the &s;tandard, recovered the &s;hock of their late de|feat, attacked the enemy, with great vigour, and gained a deci&s;ive victory: the hor&s;e's tail was highly
<PB N="197" REF="200">
honoured, in con&s;equence of this &s;ucce&s;sful &s;tratagem of war, and from that time was re&s;pected, as the mo&s;t honourable en&s;ign in the Ottoman armies. The Tail was given to every commander, of any con&s;ider|able body of troops, and &s;oldiers were u&s;ually inli&s;ted under this &s;tandard; in proce&s;s of time, cu&s;tom con|verted it into a mark of dignity; but in order to di&s;|tingui&s;h the different ranks of commanders, they varied the number of tails; and this difference at pre&s;ent denotes the rank and authority of the gover|nors of provinces.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of <HI>Beglier-Beys.</HI> Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t order are called <HI>Cajel-Beglier-Beys;</HI> who&s;e revenues ari&s;e from lord&s;hips, and from all the lands in general, within the di&s;trict of their governments. The &s;econd are called <HI>Saliani-Beglier-Beys;</HI> who&s;e &s;alaries are paid from the Sultan's trea&s;ury, under the direction of the defterdar, on whom they are greatly dependant.</P>
<P>Next to the grand vi&s;ir, the <HI>Beglier-Beys</HI> are the mo&s;t re&s;pected per&s;onages in the empire, and have the greate&s;t authority. Their governments are al|ways either kingdoms, or exten&s;ive provinces; and they have &s;everal <HI>Ba&s;haw-Beys,</HI> and <HI>Sangiacks,</HI> be|&s;ides a prodigious number of inferior officers, &s;ubject
<PB N="198" REF="201">
to their will and plea&s;ure. The wealth of the Beglier-beys is immen&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>O&s;man,</HI> Beglier-bey of Dama&s;cus, not many years decea&s;ed, left in his trea&s;ury twelve millions of pia&s;tres in &s;pecie, be&s;ides a great quantity of rich jewels; and he likewi&s;e died po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of very valuable landed property; yet Dama&s;cus is not reckoned one of the be&s;t governments. According to the laws of the em|pire, all his effects &s;hould have been confi&s;cated, and tran&s;ported to the Imperial trea&s;ury, but his elde&s;t &s;on, who was Ba&s;haw of Sayda, in Syria, purcha&s;ed from the Sultan, his father's inheritance, for 10,000 pur&s;es, with this expre&s;s condition, that the Grand Signior &s;hould give him a third tail, and appoint him to his father's part of Beglier-bey of Dama&s;cus. The contract was ratified, becau&s;e the monarch knew he could not at that time obtain better terms by compul&s;ion; but after the peace was firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by the Ru&s;&s;ians, the Porte pro&s;ecuted him with &s;uch violence, that he was obliged to keep a &s;tanding army for his defence; in the end, however, his government was taken from him, and his trea|&s;ures were &s;eized; but out of regard to the memory of his father, who was highly e&s;teemed at Con&s;tan|tinople, an inferior government in Me&s;opotamia was be&s;towed on him; but this unfortunate man always neglecting to pay the cu&s;tomary tribute to the Grand
<PB N="199" REF="202">
Signior, and the u&s;ual douceurs to the Vizir, he was &s;hut up in the fortre&s;s of Siras Seba&s;tus, and his three tails taken from him; after &s;ome time he was relea&s;ed, and I &s;aw him, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> at Aleppo, very poor, and &s;upported by a younger brother, who had been a ba&s;haw, but had abdicated his govern|ment, and lived retired in that city.</P>
<P>Each Beglier-bey, in time of war, is obliged to furni&s;h &s;oldiers for the army, in proportion to the &s;tated revenues of his governments, and the ratio is, one man for every five a&s;pres and an half: he is al&s;o obliged to furni&s;h them with &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>In A&s;ia, there are eighteen Beglier-beys, or princes of three tails, who&s;e &s;alaries are, three or four excepted, about a million of a&s;pres a year, ex|clu&s;ive of Ba&s;&s;ora and Bagdat, which are now united into one government, the &s;alary of which is 18,000 ducats, and for every ducat paid them by the Sultan, they mu&s;t provide a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>In Europe there are fourteen of the&s;e Beglier-beys, their &s;alaries are from five hundred thou&s;and to a million of a&s;pres. Each of the&s;e principal govern|ments has its mufti, cadi, reis-effendi, defterdar, agha of the Jani&s;&s;aries, and <HI>Spathilar Agha&s;i.</HI> The agha of the Jani&s;&s;aries is commander in chief of
<PB N="200" REF="203">
that corps, and the <HI>Spathilar Agha&s;i</HI> is commander of the provincial troops in each province.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a Beglier-bey for Grand Cairo, who has a &s;alary of &s;ix thou&s;and ducats, though Egypt is in fact at pre&s;ent only nominally dependant on the Grand Signior.</P>
<P>When they are in march again&s;t the enemy, or going to encamp, the Beglier-beys of Natolia, Bag|dat, Grand Cairo, and Romelia, have the prece|dence of all others, and they give it to each other, according to the antiquity of their re&s;pective govern|ments, computing from the time they were con|quered by the Mu&s;&s;ulmen.</P>
<P>It would be tedious and u&s;ele&s;s to enter into the particulars of the inferior governments which depend on the principal ones, and have their mufti, cadi, &amp;c. yet they are all appointed by their governors, and not by the Grand Signior, as in the chief provinces. However, &s;ome of the&s;e dependant governments have &s;ometimes made their principals, and even the Grand Signior him&s;elf tremble by their in&s;urrections, particularly tho&s;e of Beylan and Pajas, in the vicinity of Alexandretta, and of Cogni, in Natolia.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="204">It has always been difficult to give a ju&s;t idea of the political &s;y&s;tem or con&s;titution of monarchial go|vernments, the whole depending commonly upon the caprice of the &s;overeigns, or the private intere&s;ts of tho&s;e who &s;urround him. The hi&s;tory of Turkey abounds with melancholy in&s;tances of the mo&s;t un|ju&s;t and bloody wars, and of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing re|volutions in kingdoms, proceeding from the &s;lighte&s;t cau&s;es. Though property, as we have before ob|&s;erved, is highly re&s;pected in Turkey, heads, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> are taken off with as little ceremony as an Engli&s;h gardener would cut off a parcel of cabbages from the &s;talks, and that without any apparent rea&s;on. This &s;eems to have been the mode of conduct in the old French government. No man could have his pro|perty taken from him, but by a regular cour&s;e of law, as in England, but his per&s;on was liable to be im|pri&s;oned in their Ba&s;tile, at the plea&s;ure of the mi|ni&s;ter, though it does not appear that &s;uch orders have ever been wantonly exerci&s;ed for the la&s;t hundred years, whatever giddy brained Frenchmen may a&s;|&s;ert to the contrary; and probably in exten&s;ive go|vernments, like that of France, it may be for the ge|neral welfare of the community, that &s;uch di&s;cre|tionary powers &s;hould be lodged in the hands of the mini&s;ter. Property &s;eems equally &s;acred in Turkey. A late Sultan, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> had determined to build a mo&s;que, its &s;ituation was fixed upon, and he
<PB N="202" REF="205">
&s;eemed likely to meet with no difficulty in making the nece&s;&s;ary purcha&s;es; when a Jew, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a hou&s;e of &s;mall value in the centre of this piece of ground, refu&s;ed to part with it at any price. Large offers were made in vain; the I&s;raelite was inflexible, and his avarice gave way to his ob&s;tinacy. All the courtiers, accu&s;tomed to &s;ee every oppo&s;ition bow before the prince, plea&s;ed them&s;elves with the hopes of &s;eeing the Jew's hou&s;e era&s;ed, and him&s;elf dragged to puni&s;hment. But happy the princes who confound not the &s;overeign with the man, nor believe it al|lowable to u&s;e their authority to gratify their revenge. Such was Sultan <HI>Solyman;</HI> he de&s;cended from the throne to con&s;ult the law, and wrote thus to the mufti: A man de&s;ires to build a temple to the di|vinity; all the mu&s;&s;ulmen, proprietors of the ground on which it is to be erected, are in ha&s;te to partici|pate in &s;o good a work: one only, and he a Jew, refu&s;es all offers. What puni&s;hment does he de&s;erve? None, replied the mufti. Property is &s;acred, with|out di&s;tinction of individuals; and a temple may not be erected to God, in violation of &s;o holy a law. It is favourable to the de&s;ire which the Jew, no doubt, has, to leave to his children a property, the value of which they would, perhaps &s;oon di&s;&s;ipate; but it is the right of the &s;overeign to in&s;i&s;t on hiring any ground for which he has occa&s;ion. A contract, therefore, for the hire of the ground mu&s;t be made
<PB N="203" REF="206">
out to the Jew and his de&s;cendants, and then the hou&s;e may be pulled down and the mo&s;que built, without fear that the prayers of the mu&s;&s;ulmen of|fered up therein &s;hould be rejected.</P>
<P><HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> him&s;elf admits, that revolutions would happen more frequently than even in former pe|riods of the Turki&s;h hi&s;tory, if a &s;ummary ju&s;tice was not &s;ometimes exerci&s;ed as well within the walls of the feraglio, as in the city of Con&s;tantinople, and in the provinces.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to public economy, all the fore&s;ight and prudence, that can be wi&s;hed for in the mo&s;t civilized countries, is ob&s;erved in Turkey. A rea|dine&s;s to receive, and a great care to guard and pre|&s;erve the public money, is the character of the Turki&s;h mini&s;ters of the finances, and they have likewi&s;e an adroitne&s;s peculiar to them, of impo&s;ing taxes that will not give di&s;gu&s;t, and an inconceivable alertne&s;s in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them the moment any popular di&s;con|tent appears. But to counterbalance this act of pru|dent policy, there is another of cruelty and inju&s;tice, not practi&s;ed in any other nation. The Sultan is uni|ver&s;al heir to the effects of his decea&s;ed &s;ubjects, and unle&s;s he thinks proper, will only leave the elde&s;t &s;on &s;ufficient for common &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. It is true this common law is not always enforced, but it is never|thele&s;s
<PB N="204" REF="207">
a fundamental right of the &s;overeigns in Turkey. Though this &s;tretch of de&s;poti&s;m has the appearance of public economy, as the value of the effects is paid into the public trea&s;ury, yet its prin|cipal object is the &s;upport of the arbitrary power of the monarch: for the right is &s;eldom exerted, except the decea&s;ed per&s;on was very rich, or held a con|&s;iderable office under government. The Ottoman &s;o|vereigns know very well, that great riches enable men to form powerful parties, to make dangerous con|nections, and to attempt revolutions, if they happen to be di&s;affected. It is for this rea&s;on principally, that they &s;eize the effects of rich ba&s;haws after their decea&s;e; that their &s;ons may not &s;ecure them&s;elves, by means of their numerous adherents in their fathers governments.</P>
<P>There are likewi&s;e among the Mahometans, as well as among the Chri&s;tians, a &s;et of men who fancy them&s;elves born &s;uperior to the re&s;t of the human race, by inheriting noble blood; and &s;uch men in de&s;potic governments, are greatly to be dreaded.</P>
<P>Another very &s;ingular method is taken by the Sultans to reduce the great riches of the ba&s;haws, of who&s;e influence in the empire they are become jea|lous; and that is by marrying them to their own daughters, &s;i&s;ters, or nieces, by compul&s;ion; for they
<PB N="205" REF="208">
dare not refu&s;e the propo&s;al of being &s;o nearly re|lated to their Sovereign; and they are under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of making very rich pre&s;ents to the intended bride, and after the marriage mu&s;t maintain them in a manner &s;uitable to their Imperial rank. This &s;uc|ce&s;sful method of draining their pur&s;es, likewi&s;e gives a different turn to the ambition of their dangerou&s;ly great men; as in&s;tead of being at the head of parties in oppo&s;ition to the Sultan, they warmly e&s;pou&s;e the intere&s;t of their augu&s;t relation, and are the chief &s;pies on the conduct of other ba&s;haws not in the &s;ame circum&s;tances. Thus a prince&s;s is di&s;po&s;ed of with|out expence, and the tranquillity of the &s;tate at the &s;ame time further &s;ecured. As a provi&s;ion likewi&s;e again&s;t hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ions to nobility, the chil|dren of &s;uch marriages are excluded by law from ri&s;ing to any great office under government.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e prince&s;&s;es have been married to fourteen or fifteen &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ba&s;haws. For as the principal object of the Porte is to de&s;troy that power|ful influence which exorbitant wealth creates, the Sultan obliges a ba&s;haw of &s;eventy or eighty years of age, to marry a prince&s;s hardly two months old, the hu&s;band, in that ca&s;e being obliged to be at the ex|pence of her maintenance, and that of her hou&s;ehold. He dies perhaps after a few months, and the prince&s;s is transferred by marriage to a &s;econd ba&s;haw, older
<PB N="206" REF="209">
and more infirm than the fir&s;t, and thus &s;he pa&s;&s;es from hu&s;band to hu&s;band; &s;o that in the cour&s;e of twenty years &s;he may ea&s;ily have been the widow of a dozen hu&s;bands, whom &s;he has never &s;een; and when &s;he is arrived at an age to be united to a man, then they give her a hu&s;band, to whom &s;he is de|livered, and with whom &s;he re&s;ides con&s;tantly like other wives. The&s;e ladies are called Sultanas, and during the premature marriages we have mentioned, a hotel is provided for them, in which they live apart from the Porte, but it mu&s;t be either in Con&s;tan|tinople, or its environs.</P>
<P>Another political maxim of the Turki&s;h govern|ment is the frequent change of the principal officers of &s;tate. For upon the appointment of a new officer, or his promotion to a higher po&s;t, he is obliged to make very con&s;iderable pre&s;ents to the Sultan, and the &s;hort duration of the&s;e mini&s;ters in their po&s;ts, does not permit them to adopt any ideas adver&s;e to that blind obedience and &s;lavery which is the &s;upport of de&s;poti&s;m. Be&s;ides, the&s;e mini&s;ters to indemnify them&s;elves for the great di&s;bur&s;ements they have made in pre&s;ents, are obliged to oppre&s;s and rob the people they govern; and this has an admirable ten|dency to accompli&s;h one principal end in the Turki&s;h &s;y&s;tem of politics, which is to depre&s;s the &s;pirits of the people in the provinces by frequent vexations
<PB N="207" REF="210">
and extortions, that they may be accu&s;tomed to bear the yoke of &s;lavery without murmuring, It is well known, that no bounds can be pre&s;cribed to the in|&s;atiable love of riches; if therefore &s;ome of the ba&s;haws of provinces and their &s;angiacks &s;hould have gone too great lengths, in order to ama&s;s money ra|pidly, under the apprehen&s;ion of being removed; they are effectually removed, by having their heads taken from their &s;houlders, and the Sultan thus de|mon&s;trates his love to his &s;ubjects, and fills his coffers by the &s;eizure of the immen&s;e riches of the criminal.</P>
<P>The &s;econd branch of the Ottoman &s;y&s;tem of po|litics, re&s;pects the intere&s;ts of the &s;tate, at home and abroad. No people ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the art of di&s;&s;i|mulation, or, to &s;peak in the courtly &s;tile of <HI>Che&s;ter|field,</HI> of &s;imulation, in a greater degree than the Turks. They know how to make an opportune &s;a|crifice, even of their mo&s;t darling pa&s;&s;ions, to their political intere&s;ts. It is an ab&s;urd idea, too gene|nerally entertained, that the Turks are choleric and untractable; on the contrary, when it &s;uits their pur|po&s;e, either as a nation or as individuals, no people are more pliant; they will even &s;ubmit to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t in|&s;ults, to gain a favourite point, or an important object.</P>
<P>They have the addroitne&s;s on the &s;ubject of public affairs, to publi&s;h ju&s;t what they think proper, to
<PB N="208" REF="211">
amu&s;e the people, and to blend truth with fal&s;hood, &s;o artfully, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover the de|ceit; thus deluded, at &s;everal periods of the Ru&s;&s;ian war, the Turks believed they were in the arms of vic|tory, when they were almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the enemy, and defeated in every quarter.</P>
<P>The Ottoman cabinet &s;pares neither pains not ex|pence, to acquire an intimate knowledge of the views, and intere&s;ts of all the other powers of Europe. And having &s;carce any public mini&s;ters, at the different courts, it is remarkable they obtain earlier, and better intelligence, from their &s;ecret enemies, than is received, or tran&s;mitted home, by the whole <HI>corps diplomatique.</HI> A memorable proof of this was given at Con&s;tantinople, upon the death of the late King of France, Louis XV. The Grand Vi&s;ir notified this event publicly, five days before the courier from France brought the intelligence to the Marquis de St Prie&s;t, the French amba&s;&s;ador, at Con&s;tantinople. The&s;e emi&s;&s;aries are either Greeks or Jews, and they find the means of conveying intelligence to the Porte, much &s;ooner than any mini&s;ter. The policy of the Turks in this article, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> is admirable; for the dignity of the Sultan is never committed by any act of the&s;e emi&s;&s;aries; whereas if a declared mini&s;ter receives an in&s;ult, his royal ma&s;ter is obliged to re|&s;ent it; or if he commits any gro&s;s error, at the court
<PB N="209" REF="212">
to which he is &s;ent, his ma&s;ter mu&s;t be re&s;pon|&s;ible. Such emi&s;&s;aries likewi&s;e mix freely with the people, and thereby gain information which would never be given to an avowed mini&s;ter. So well &s;erved is the Porte by the&s;e agents, that <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> who was &s;ecretary to a late grand vi&s;ir, a&s;&s;erts he has &s;een, upon the vi&s;ir's table, exact li&s;ts of the military forces of the principal powers in Europe; with calculations of the utmo&s;t amount of &s;hips, and troops, they could po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;emble for particular purpo&s;es; details of their reciprocal mi&s;under&s;tand|ings; intere&s;ting anecdotes of the internal admini&s;|tration of their re&s;pective governments, and de|lineations of the ruling characters of their prime mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>What &s;hall we &s;ay then of a court &s;o well informed, where the major part are &s;oldiers, and where the want of &s;ucce&s;s in their generals is puni&s;hed with death; in fine, where mea&s;ures are &s;o well concerted, before a war is commenced, when we &s;ee its empire ha&s;ten|ing to di&s;&s;olution; but that de&s;poti&s;m and avarice, on the part of its rulers; and cowardice and indo|lence, on the part of the people, uniting with &s;uper|&s;tition and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, are undermining its foun|dation? It is po&s;&s;ible however, &s;ome man of genius may &s;tart up, and, availing him&s;elf of the docility, and flexibility, of his countrymen, train and lead
<PB N="210" REF="213">
them on to victory, to conque&s;t, and deliverance from the dreaded yoke of the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>Another article of dome&s;tic policy in Turkey is, to &s;ecure a con&s;tant &s;upply of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life, on ea&s;y terms. The Turki&s;h government merits much prai&s;e for its &s;trict attention to the articles of provi&s;ion; of which there is always very great abundance, at Con&s;tantinople; notwith|&s;tanding the immen&s;e number of its inhabitants, ex|ceeding that of any other capital in Europe. The markets are daily &s;upplied, not only abundantly, but on more moderate terms than in any other city; and the variety is &s;o great, that the mo&s;t luxurious appe|tite may be ea&s;ily gratified. For this purpo&s;e, the government takes care to keep up a good under&s;tand|ing with all tho&s;e places, from whence provi&s;ions, or other conveniences of life, are brought to Con&s;tan|tinople; they will &s;uffer indignities, outrages, and even &s;editions, without re&s;entment, from the Tartars of the Crimea; becau&s;e they furni&s;h the city with va&s;t quantities of provi&s;ions, forage, &amp;c. It is for the &s;ame rea&s;on the Turks are &s;o careful to pre&s;erve to them&s;elves, the navigation of the Black Sea.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> Laws and Revenue.</HEAD>
<P>ALL law proceedings, in Turkey, are reduced to the depo&s;ition of witne&s;&s;es; no other proofs are admitted, or required; and witne&s;&s;es, according to <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> are to be purcha&s;ed at any rate. The judge has it always in his power to declare which are fal&s;e, and which are true witne&s;&s;es; this opens the door to private intere&s;t; for the be&s;t witne&s;&s;es are ge|nerally tho&s;e, who&s;e employers can make the riche&s;t pre&s;ents to the judge; and when the partiality and oppre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e judges have &s;tirred up the people, to carry their complaints to the foot of the throne, the Sovereign, the above author adds, mo&s;t graciou&s;ly conde&s;cends to open the Imperial trea&s;ury, to receive the riches they have ama&s;&s;ed, as fines for the fal&s;e judgment they have given, and to appoint new judges, as venal as their predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Fortunately for the di&s;mi&s;&s;ed judges, they belong to a corps dreaded by the &s;ultans, and therefore are
<PB N="212" REF="215">
permitted to wear their heads in ob&s;curity the re|mainder of their lives.</P>
<P>It is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to give credit to the &s;everity of the puni&s;hments inflicted in Turkey, or the rapidity of executing them. The Turki&s;h government hardly makes any di&s;tinction of offences; for it puni&s;hes equally with death tho&s;e violations of the law, how|ever trifling, which happen through negligence or in|attention, as well as the mo&s;t atrocious crimes. In an empire like the Turki&s;h, this extreme &s;everity is almo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to its pre&s;ervation. The frequent changes of the governors of provinces, and other great officers of &s;tate, who are generally promoted to an&s;wer the particular views of the Sultan, or grand vi&s;ir, without any regard to abilities or merit, is the fruitful &s;ource of many evils, which frequent and &s;udden executions are &s;uppo&s;ed in &s;ome mea&s;ure to remedy.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the military, the &s;ame &s;everity being extended to every rank of officers, it is re|markable that in&s;tances of cowardice or mi&s;conduct in Turki&s;h generals happen very &s;eldom; on the contrary, the dread of puni&s;hment has made them perform the mo&s;t heroic actions. The rigour of the laws, and the certainty of being put to death for violating them, affects all orders of men
<PB N="213" REF="216">
throughout the empire. It obliges them who hold public offices to be attentive and diligent in the di&s;|charge of their important duties, and produces in the ma&s;s of the people that humility and moderation, which is not to be met with in the common people of any other country.</P>
<P>In fact, it is very a&s;toni&s;hing that in &s;o large and populous a city as Con&s;tantinople, inhabited by per|&s;ons of different nations and religions, a murder or a robbery is &s;carce ever committed; it therefore mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly owes its public tranquillity and good order to the regulation of its police, which we have already noticed.</P>
<P>The Grand Vi&s;ir, the Capitan Pacha, the Agha of the Jani&s;&s;aries, and the Bo&s;tangi Ba&s;haw, are the only mini&s;ters who have the right of inflicting con|dign puni&s;hment each in their re&s;pective departments. But the grand vi&s;ir is ab&s;olute in this particular, over all manner of per&s;ons whatever, including even the other mini&s;ters ju&s;t mentioned; for he is the executor of the &s;upreme will of the Sultan, unle&s;s he choo&s;es to draw the hand of ju&s;tice him&s;elf, a circum&s;tance which frequently occurred in the early part of the Ottoman hi&s;tory, but of which there is no in&s;tance of late date; the Turki&s;h &s;overeigns having imitated the examples of Chri&s;tian powers, by throwing the
<PB N="214" REF="217">
burthen of every act of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion on the head and &s;houlders of their mini&s;ters or political porters. The inferior officers of ju&s;tice may inflict pecuniary puni&s;hments, impri&s;on and cha&s;ti&s;e by corporal pains.</P>
<P>The modes of execution in Turkey, not practi&s;ed in the Chri&s;tian nations of Europe, are impaling, &s;uf|focations, and &s;trangling; but of late years behead|ing with the &s;cimitar is the mo&s;t prevailing; and with re&s;pect to great men, and upon &s;udden emer|gencies, after the fatal mandate is i&s;&s;ued, it is executed in the mo&s;t &s;peedy manner po&s;&s;ible, the capigi bachi, or the executioner, frequently coming with his attendants upon the per&s;on he is ordered to di&s;|patch, by &s;urprize, in his hou&s;e, or in his gardens, or on the highway, and according to the &s;ituation in which he finds him to be, &s;ometimes laying him acro&s;s the knees of one, while another &s;trikes off his head at a blow; at other times when &s;itting upon his &s;ofa, &s;moaking his pipe, or taking his coffee, off goes the head of the per&s;on whom the capigi bachi was orders to put to death, at a moment when &s;uch a cata&s;trophe was lea&s;t expected; the warrant having been &s;hewn to his attendants by the executioners in their way to his apartments, impo&s;es profound &s;ilence, and an im|plicit obedience from the dread of their own per|&s;onal &s;afety being endangered if they make any noi&s;e.
<PB N="215" REF="218">
In ca&s;es of re&s;i&s;tance, which proceed only from the unforunate victim him&s;elf, or perhaps the zeal of &s;ome devoted &s;lave, a horrid mangling en&s;ues; the executioner, who has made him&s;elf expert in his office, by throwing up apples in the air, and cutting them in half as they de&s;cend, aims at the neck as well as he can, but mi&s;&s;ing his mark, makes dreadful havock in de&s;troying his victim.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Capigi Bachis,</HI> &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> are a kind of chamberlains, who introduce all tho&s;e per&s;ons, who have audiences of the Grand Signior, into his pre&s;ence. They are likewi&s;e to execute all the orders of the Sultan, of what nature &s;oever they may be. To collect provi&s;ions, levy troops, confirm a pacha in his po&s;t, drain him of his wealth, cut off his head, conduct him into exile, or poi&s;on him on the road, make a part of the office of <HI>Capigi Bachis.</HI></P>
<P>When the Porte wi&s;hed formerly to di&s;patch any powerful ba&s;haws, one of the&s;e Capigi Bachis were &s;ent to him, who came under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip; but their attempts having frequently mi&s;carried, they have been obliged, &s;ays the above writer, to adopt the re&s;ource of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating or poi&s;oning tho&s;e officers they have re&s;olved to puni&s;h. In this ca&s;e, the per|&s;on employed, di&s;gui&s;es him&s;elf as well as he can; and furni&s;hed with an order which he carefully con|ceals,
<PB N="216" REF="219">
endeavours to get at the per&s;on pro&s;cribed, choo&s;es if po&s;&s;ible, the opportunity when the divan is &s;itting, of killing his man, pre&s;ents his order, and runs no further ri&s;k if he has been &s;ufficiently dextrous not to fail in his blow.</P>
<P>To render robbers on the highway puni&s;hable, they mu&s;t be taken in the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome daring crime. The legi&s;lator of the Arabs, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> thought, no doubt, he owed this complai&s;ance to a nation which lived only by rapine. If any murders are committed in a village, the cadi repairs there and lays a fine on the inhabitants, without troubling him&s;elf to take the offenders. On this account the country people are but too apt to conceal the crimes that have been com|mitted from the judge, who&s;e pre&s;ence is more dan|gerous to them than that of the thieves, who like trade&s;men in our cities, not having taken up their freedom, are puni&s;hed when found at work; but when rich, quit their occupation, recount the feats they have performed, are honoured with re&s;pect, and arrive at employments in which they have again opportunity to exerci&s;e their abilities.</P>
<P>It is a &s;hocking truth, adds the above author, that murders are &s;uffered to be pardoned in Turkey, at the interce&s;&s;ion of the neare&s;t relations of the party murdered. Of this Baron <HI>Tott</HI> gives a very remark|able
<PB N="217" REF="220">
in&s;tance. A Turk in ha&s;te to inherit, had mur|dered his father, and was condemned on the &s;tronge&s;t proof to lo&s;e his head. One of his friends, the com|panion of his debaucheries, ha&s;tened to the judge, with a large &s;um of money, where he was informed that the &s;entence had already been pronounced. Not di&s;couraged at this information, he continued to pre&s;s the Cadi, whom the &s;ight of &s;uch a bribe had al|ready won over to his intere&s;t. I cannot, &s;aid he to his client, acquit your friend without a &s;tronger proof of his innocence than the evidence on which he has been convicted. Be bold enough to declare your&s;elf the murderer of his father, procure two wit|ne&s;&s;es, and I will condemn you to undergo the pu|ni&s;hment to which he has been &s;entenced; he will be immediately re-in&s;tated in all his rights, and have the power to grant you a pardon. The undertaking was hazardous, no great confidence could be placed in a parricide, however he con&s;ented. The con|victed criminal was accordingly relea&s;ed, pardoned the pretended murderer, and this villainy. conducted in due form of law, &s;ays the Baron, was completely &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the proce&s;&s;es which are cau&s;ed by judicial informations, verification of title, and appeals to &s;u|perior tribunals, all private quarrels and accu&s;ations are, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, brought before the judge,
<PB N="218" REF="221">
without the other party daring to refu&s;e his appear|ance, if the di&s;pute has taken place in pre&s;ence of a number of people.</P>
<P>At the very name of ju&s;tice, the multitude will al|ways take part again&s;t him by whom it has been re|fu&s;ed: it is &s;acred among all nations; it is the central point of the human mind; it may be mi&s;|taken, we may endeavour to elude it, or deceive others, but we cannot deceive our&s;elves.</P>
<P>He who gains the day, always pays the co&s;ts; the fear of lo&s;ing what they have, cannot therefore re|pre&s;s the de&s;ire of defrauding others; and the pu|ni&s;hments denounced again&s;t fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es in Turkey, to be led through the &s;treets on an a&s;s, with the face turned towards the tail, are rarely executed; accord|ing to the above author, the judges to who&s;e intere&s;t they contribute, owe them too much re&s;pect.</P>
<P>A Turk, adds the Baron, was de&s;irous of di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing his neighbour of a field, of which he was the legal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. He began by procuring a &s;ufficient number of witne&s;&s;es to depo&s;e that the field had been &s;old him by the proprietor; he afterwards applied to the judge, and remitted him 500 pia&s;tres, to engage him to authori&s;e his villainy. This mea&s;ure &s;ufficiently proved the &s;ubtlety and wickedne&s;s of his claims, and
<PB N="219" REF="222">
excited the indignation of the cadi; he di&s;&s;embled his anger however, and gave a hearing to the parties. The lawful owner of the field dwelt on the in&s;uffi|ciency of the other's title. You have no witne&s;&s;es then &s;aid the judge? No matter, he adds, I have five hundred for you which depo&s;e in your favour. He then produced the pur&s;e he had received as a bribe, and drove away the fal&s;e claimant.</P>
<P>This anecdote, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> though it does honour to the integrity of the judge, does none to the law; which is always the &s;ame, namely that if one party denies, the other is permitted to prove by witne&s;&s;es. For in&s;tance, &s;ays the Baron, if I am &s;ued by a man I have never &s;een, for a debt I never owed, I &s;hall be obliged to pay him, on the depo|&s;ition of two Turki&s;h witne&s;&s;es, who &s;hall affirm their knowledge of the debt.</P>
<P><HI>Pey&s;onnel,</HI> in this part of his &s;trictures on Baron <HI>Tott</HI>'s memoirs, remarks, that in&s;tead of reciting the laws, the Baron only relates how they are abu&s;ed. Had he taken the trouble to turn over their <HI>Mulleka,</HI> which is their written order, and contains all the pre|cepts of their religious wor&s;hip, and the whole of their juri&s;prudence, both civil and criminal; if he had con&s;ulted <HI>Durer</HI> and <HI>Kalebi,</HI> its two principal commentaries; if he had examined the collections of
<PB N="220" REF="223">
the <HI>Fetfas,</HI> or &s;entences of the mo&s;t celebrated muftis; and e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Ali Effendi, he would have found a multitude of wi&s;e and well dige&s;ted laws and deci&s;ions no le&s;s equitable than ingenious. He would have publi&s;hed them, and with rea&s;on declaimed and thundered again&s;t tho&s;e unju&s;t judges who had ren|dered them of no effect. Far be it from me, &s;ays <HI>Pey&s;onnel,</HI> to attack, or even &s;upport, the integrity of Chri&s;tian magi&s;trates. But if any one &s;hould weigh, in the balance of equity, the inconveniences of the two &s;y&s;tems of judicature; if, without &s;peaking of the corruption, favour, cabals, intrigue, &s;olicitations, and influence of men in power, were he only to put into the other &s;cale, in oppo&s;ition to the defects of Mahometan ju&s;tice, the cea&s;ele&s;s litigations which in the courts of Europe la&s;t from generation to genera|tion; the hydra of forms; the labyrinth of rights, and cu&s;toms; the privileges of nobles, cities, and cor|porations; and the enormous expences of ju&s;tice, which have often amounted to ten times the property in di&s;pute; it would be difficult to decide which &s;cale outweighed the other.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of giving an abridgment of the ordinances of <HI>Soliman</HI> the Great, which extend to every part of the civil, feudal, and military juridiction, as well as to the expenditure of the revenue, and which give a determinate and accurate idea of the extent of the
<PB N="221" REF="224">
power of the Sultan, of the bounds pre&s;cribed him by the laws, and of that portion delegated by him to the Vi&s;irs, Agas, and the &s;ubaltern officers in the provinces, he has contented him&s;elf with a&s;&s;erting, that the&s;e vi&s;irs and pachas, are &s;o many ra&s;cals, who derive from each other the power of oppre&s;&s;ing and arbitrarily plundering the people, and that the fruits of the&s;e numerous extortions and villainies, all flow into the re&s;ervoir of the de&s;pot, which &s;wallows up the entire wealth of the &s;ubject. He, with other writers, loudly declaims again&s;t the proofs by wit|ne&s;&s;es, by which all cau&s;es are decided in the Turki&s;h tribunals; he likewi&s;e declaims again&s;t the number of fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es, which are but too ea&s;ily procured for money, without con&s;idering that the te&s;timony of witne&s;&s;es is the ba&s;is of all criminal proceedings in every country, and that fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es are unhappily every where but too numerous, while the truth or fal&s;ity of their a&s;&s;ertions can only be di&s;covered by the &s;agacity of the judge.</P>
<P>The Baron has certainly cited &s;everal in&s;tances not very honourable to Ottoman ju&s;tice. But would it be equitable, in order to give an idea of the ju&s;tice exerci&s;ed in the higher courts of France, to cite as examples the proceedings again&s;t &s;orcerers, or the condemnatlon and unju&s;t puni&s;hment of Mare&s;chal de <HI>Marillac,</HI> of <HI>Calas,</HI> or of many others. Ought not
<PB N="222" REF="225">
a writer on &s;uch &s;ubjects to di&s;tingui&s;h between the nature of the law and its abu&s;es, which proceed from ignorance, error, prevarication, or tyranny? The Turks have, no doubt, like other nations, their mo|ments of relaxation and in&s;anity, in which the laws lo&s;e their force, the people their under&s;tanding, and the government its authority; in which there is no counterpoi&s;e to the tyranny of the monarch, the avidity of tho&s;e in office, or the rapacity of &s;ubalterns, in which all good in&s;titutions are neglected, and every thing is plunged in confu&s;ion and anarchy. But would an author be thought to give a ju&s;t idea of the French monarchy in &s;electing the reigns of <HI>Charles</HI> VI, VII, and that of <HI>Louis</HI> XI, or by de&s;cribing the ma&s;&s;acre of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> or the commotions of the League, or the Fronde? A nation, which in the la&s;t century, carried its victorious arms to the very walls of Vienna; and even in the year 1789, triumphed over the united efforts of the Ru&s;&s;ians and Germans, and concluded, after a brilliant victory, the glorious peace of Belgrade. How unju&s;t in modern writers to repre&s;ent &s;uch a people as a &s;warm of law|le&s;s barbarians, without order, ju&s;tice, manners, or character, and ignorant of the fir&s;t principles of every &s;cience. Trials in Turkey, remarks <HI>Thevenot,</HI> ex|cept in &s;ome very intricate ca&s;es, &s;eldom la&s;t above four or five hours, &s;o that the laws delay cannot be complained of in this country.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="226">To prevent murders and robberies during the night, no per&s;on is permitted, &s;ays the above author, to walk the &s;treets of Con&s;tantinople after it is dark, except in the month of Ramazan. Should the under ba&s;haw, who is captain of the watch, and walks his rounds in the night like our con&s;tables, meet with any per&s;on tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the law, he is carried before the cadi, who examines him; and if he cannot give &s;u|cient rea&s;on for being in the &s;treets, after the night has &s;et in, though it &s;hould be even moon-light, he is fined and ba&s;tinadoed; and though he &s;hould be di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed without any puni&s;hment being inflicted on him, it is con&s;idered as a di&s;grace to have been even taken up and carried before the judge.</P>
<P><HI>Le Brun</HI> likewi&s;e ob&s;erves, that if any per&s;on is found murdered, and it is not known who committed the murder, the per&s;on oppo&s;ite to who&s;e hou&s;e the murder was committed, if in the &s;treets, is fined to the amount of three hundred crowns. From this law however, the Franks are exempted. If the mur|derer be taken, and the next of kin are minors, he who committed the murder mu&s;t remain in pri&s;on till they are of age.</P>
<P>It is the office of the Bo&s;tangi Bachi, to give the torture to tho&s;e unfortunate per&s;ons, from whom they endeavour by this cruel expedient, to force a con|fe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="224" REF="227">
of whatever they may &s;u&s;pect to be concealed. The place in which it is inflicted is called the oven of the Bo&s;tangi Bachi, which name is given it from its &s;ituation. Immediately on entering the walls of the &s;eraglio, are the barracks of the Bo&s;tangis; near which is an oven u&s;ed by the bakers to bake bread and bi&s;cuits for their u&s;e. On one &s;ide of this oven is the pri&s;on, in which tho&s;e unhappy per&s;ons who are to undergo the torture are confined. After the prayer <HI>Yat&s;on,</HI> which is at two in the morning, when the Bo&s;tangis are retired to re&s;t in their barracks, the pri&s;oners are conducted to a place at &s;ome di&s;tance, to avoid the interce&s;&s;ion of the Bo&s;tangis, who are &s;ometimes moved with pity at their &s;ufferings, and there the Bo&s;tangi Bachi inflicts on the&s;e unfortunate wretches &s;everal different kinds of torture. When any one therefore is delivered into the hands of this terrible officer, the common people &s;ay, he is in the oven of the Bo&s;tangi Bachi.</P>
<P>The principal puni&s;hments in Turkey, for le&s;&s;er crimes, are the ba&s;tinado, which is a certain number of blows given on the &s;oles of the feet. For this pur|po&s;e there is a kind of engine made of very thick wood, in the middle of which are two holes, about twelve inches apart, into which they put the feet of the per&s;on who is to receive this puni&s;hment. He is then laid on his back, and his legs are tied to
<PB N="225" REF="228">
this engine, called by the Turks a <HI>Falacca.</HI> Two per&s;ons, upon this, lift the Falacca &s;o high, that he who is to be puni&s;hed touches the ground only with his &s;houlders, which prevents his moving or making any re&s;i&s;tance. Two others then come with &s;hort &s;ticks, or rather laths, about half an inch in thickne&s;s, and give him the number of blows that he is &s;entenced to receive. This puni&s;hment is very &s;evere, and will &s;ometimes prevent a per&s;on from having the u&s;e of his feet for &s;everal weeks or months, if it has been received to the number of three or four hundred blows for any great crime. But five and twenty or thirty &s;trokes, the u&s;ual number, are thought nothing of, and will not prevent a per&s;on from walking about as before. Some travellers mention their having &s;een per&s;ons receive the ba&s;tinado for &s;elling articles of the mo&s;t trifling value a little &s;hort of weight; nay even for endeavouring to impo&s;e upon children, though it might be only to the value of a farthing or two; &s;o rigid are the Turks in their adherence to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The ba&s;tinado is &s;ometiems inflicted on the breech, but then the drawers are not taken off. In this man|ner likewi&s;e the women are puni&s;hed. This cor|rection is con&s;idered even more &s;evere than that in|flicted on the &s;oles of the feet, e&s;pecially if a great number of &s;trokes are given; as the putrefied and dead fle&s;h is afterwards obliged to be cut off with a
<PB N="226" REF="229">
razor, to prevent its turning to a mortification, and the per&s;ons who have undergone this cha&s;ti&s;ement, will be &s;ometimes confined perhaps for many months to their bed. The Turks are allowed to inflict the ba&s;tinado upon the &s;oles of the feet on their &s;laves, the dread of which makes them extremely attentive and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive in their obedience to their ma&s;ters. Schoolma&s;ters likewi&s;e do not whip their &s;cholars as we do in England, but correct them on the &s;oles of their feet.</P>
<P>One apparent good property of the civil law among the Turks, is what we have in part before noticed, which is the right every individual has of pleading in his own cau&s;e. But of what advantage, &s;ays the Baron, is this privilege in a country where the judg|ment is arbitrary? Hence it ari&s;es that the Jews, the Armenians, and the Greeks have inve&s;ted their chiefs with a kind of civil juri&s;diction, to which they &s;ome|times &s;ubmit, to avoid having the property for which they contend devoured by the Cadi, who decides the cau&s;e. But except among the Jews, who pay more obedience to the Kakam, than the Chri&s;tians to their patriarch, it is very common for tho&s;e adjudged to have been in the wrong, to refer the matter to the Turki&s;h judges. A &s;ufficient proof, we think, that the Turki&s;h courts of law, are neither &s;o arbitrary nor &s;o corrupt as the Baron would wi&s;h to in&s;inuate.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="230">The law re&s;pecting &s;laves is another proof of the humanity and wi&s;dom of the Turki&s;h legi&s;lature; it not only requires the ma&s;ter to part with his &s;lave, if the &s;lave be di&s;&s;atisfied with his &s;ituation and treat|ment, but it likewi&s;e refu&s;es to admit the evidence of a &s;lave either for or again&s;t his ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The Emperor's council of &s;tate is called <HI>Galibe Divan,</HI> and meets twice a week in the &s;ultan's palace, on Sundays and Thur&s;days. The Grand vi&s;ir &s;its as pre&s;ident, with the two judges of Romelia, and Na|tolia, one at his right, and the other on his left hand. When the Sultan convenes a general council, to which all the grand per&s;ons of the empire are &s;um|moned, &s;uch a divan is called <HI>Ajak Divani;</HI> the whole a&s;&s;embly &s;tanding.</P>
<P>The high court of ju&s;tice is generally held in a large hall of the grand vi&s;ir's palace, called <HI>Divan Chane.</HI> The grand vi&s;ir is obliged, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> to &s;it four days in this hall, to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice to the people; unle&s;s, which &s;eldom happens, he &s;hould be prevented by affairs of a very important nature. In this ca&s;e, his place is &s;upplied by the Chiaux Bachi, or the ma&s;ter of reque&s;ts. The bills or re|pre&s;entations of the parties are read, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tant judges generally give their opinion of the ca&s;es laid before them: if their verdict be agreeable to the
<PB N="228" REF="231">
grand vi&s;ir, it is written on the <HI>arzuhal,</HI> and the grand vi&s;ir &s;ub&s;cribes it; if he di&s;approves it, he him|&s;elf pronounces a decree, and orders a copy of it to be given to the parties. By this means &s;uits are &s;oon brought to an i&s;&s;ue in Turkey. The &s;ame mode of admini&s;tering ju&s;tice holds through all the provinces.</P>
<P>As to the revenues of the Turks, it is very diffi|cult for a &s;tranger, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> to obtain a ju&s;t ac|count of them. For this rea&s;on, he adds, I have undertaken to &s;atisfy the reader on this head, having my&s;elf been employed in tho&s;e departments.</P>
<P>All the revenues of the Ottoman empire are di|vided into two departments, one in the &s;eraglio, and the other in the city. The principal is called <HI>Miri,</HI> and the &s;econd <HI>Ka&s;na.</HI> The Miri is the trea&s;ury of the empire and the <HI>Defterdar</HI> directs it, who has under him twelve officers, to which all the revenues of the empire ari&s;ing from tributes, cu&s;toms, &amp;c. are re|turnable; and from the&s;e the army is paid. The trea&s;urer is allowed the twentieth part of all the money brought into the trea&s;ury, which brings him in near fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling a year; one fourth of which he is however obliged to pay to the grand vi&s;ir's com|mi&s;&s;ary. The money of the trea&s;ury is called <HI>Dei|tulmali Mu&s;limin;</HI> or, the public money of the mu&s;|&s;ulmen; and it is not to be touched by the Emperor,
<PB N="229" REF="232">
but in ca&s;es of the greate&s;t immergency, much le&s;s for private occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The revenues of the empire paid into the Imperial trea&s;ury, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> amount to thirty millions of Turki&s;h pia&s;tres, without reckoning the produce of the gold and &s;ilver mines. This income of thirty millions is drawn from various re&s;ources. In the fir&s;t place, from the <HI>Karag,</HI> which is the capitation-tax that the Chri&s;tians and Jews pay, women excepted; and likewi&s;e tho&s;e who are under the protection of the foreign amba&s;&s;adors. Every male, at the age of fourteen, mu&s;t pay this tribute: it is divided into three cla&s;&s;es; the highe&s;t pays eleven pia&s;ters, the middle cla&s;s half that &s;um, and the lowe&s;t only a fourth part of it. If the &s;tate is urgent for &s;upplies, this tax is then doubled. When the tax is only &s;ingle, it amounts one year with another, to about &s;ix mil|lions of pia&s;ters. The &s;alt-pits and the fi&s;heries pro|duce about four millions more. The di&s;po&s;al of par|ticular places under government, brings in another three millions. The public funds produce five mil|lions or more, and the cu&s;toms eight millions; the three principal Cu&s;tom-hou&s;es are tho&s;e of Con&s;tan|tinople, Smyrna, and Salonica; were the duties paid in the&s;e three places under the &s;ame regulations as the cu&s;toms in other countries, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> they would bring in four times as much. The taxes paid
<PB N="230" REF="233">
on tobacco, coffee, &s;pices, and &s;ome other articles, amount to four millions more, which make in all the thirty millions above-mentioned.</P>
<P>The di&s;bur&s;ements of the Imperial trea&s;ury are for the fleet, the pay of the Jani&s;&s;aries, and other land-forces; the &s;alaries of the officers of &s;tate, judges, &amp;c. with other incidental charges, which al|together greatly exceed the revenues. This bank, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> is at pre&s;ent in a very bad &s;tate, be&s;ides a debt of &s;ixteen millions, which it owes to the Grand Signior's trea&s;ury; it is likewi&s;e in arrears to the Ja|ni&s;&s;aries for their pay, and to many of the civil of|ficers for their &s;alaries and pen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The revenues of the <HI>Ka&s;na,</HI> or private trea&s;ury of the Grand Signior, are of two kinds. The tributes paid by different nations, which are certain and fixed; and the incidental revenues which are much more con&s;iderable. The&s;e incidental ones, are derived from the inheritance of the ba&s;haws who die without heirs, from pecuniary puni&s;hments, from the tenth of all &s;orts of acqui&s;ition, and from a part of the produce of the mines. The &s;ilver ones &s;ituated in the neigh|bourhood of Erzerom, which formerly yielded a very great revenue, now bring in little or nothing; be|cau&s;e there is no wood in the environs, and the car|riage of it becomes too expen&s;ive. Tho&s;e of Diar|bekir,
<PB N="231" REF="234">
which were very abundant in the fine&s;t gold, do not produce the &s;ixth part of what they brought in formerly; the people who worked them having been driven away by the continual incur&s;ion of troops.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;advantages, the Grand Signior's trea&s;ury is in a very flouri&s;hing &s;tate. The plunder of &s;o many rich ba&s;haws has brought in im|men&s;e funds, and the &s;ultans have for many years back reformed their hou&s;ehold, and limited their expences: they have al&s;o le&s;&s;ened the &s;alaries of their &s;ervants, and even the ornaments of their wo|men, on which the &s;ultans of former times be&s;towed immen&s;e &s;ums. As for the per&s;onal expences of the Sultan, &s;uch as buildings, clothes, and gallantry, they are defrayed, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> by his mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior is the &s;ole di&s;pen&s;er of this im|men&s;e trea&s;ure, and it is with the utmo&s;t difficulty he can be induced to lend any &s;um to the trea&s;ury of the &s;tate, if its wants are not uncommonly pre&s;&s;ing. The mini&s;ters al&s;o, on their part, avoid as much as po&s;|&s;ible, having recour&s;e to him, to &s;hun the reproaches of a bad admini&s;tration, or the mortification of &s;eeing their Sovereign chagrined at &s;uch an application.</P>
<P>But when nece&s;&s;ity obliges them to apply for re|lief, which has frequently been the ca&s;e of late years,
<PB N="232" REF="235">
the Grand Signior, who was of a timid di&s;po&s;ition, has in&s;tantly complied with their reque&s;t; but at the &s;ame time taken every precaution to be reimbur&s;ed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and even with intere&s;t. There are al&s;o certain political maxims in the &s;eraglio for the management of this trea&s;ury, which make the &s;ultans deem it prudent to refu&s;e, as far as it lies in their power, to part with any very con&s;iderable &s;ums; well knowing that with money they can at any time appea&s;e tumults that may chance to ari&s;e, and prevent revolutions.</P>

from the Turks by the Ru&s;&s;ians, and now in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, having rather a better opportunity here of de&s;cribing it more fully, we &s;hall do it.</P>
<P>The Precopite Tartars, inhabitants of the Cher&s;on|ne&s;us, now called the Crimea, or Little Tartary, between the Wolga and the Tanais, were till lately in alliance with the Ottoman Porte; there exi&s;ting between them and the Porte a reciprocal convention, that if the male line of the Ottoman emperors &s;hould fail, the Khan of Crimea was to &s;ucceed to the em|pire of Turkey; and in default of male i&s;&s;ue in the Khan, the Ottoman monarch was to inherit the Crimea. This convention was the cau&s;e of that union which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;o long between them, and for the &s;ame rea&s;ons the Tartars &s;uffered patiently that their Khans &s;hould be elected by the &s;ultan of Turkey, who however could not choo&s;e any per&s;on that was not of the blood-royal of the Khans. In former times the elde&s;t &s;on of the Khan was required to re|&s;ide at Con&s;tantinople, as a ho&s;tage of the fidelity of the Crimea: but for many years back, this compact was not executed on the part of the Tartars, they conceiving it unju&s;t. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Crimea however, is very different from what it was only a few years ago; for in the la&s;t war between the Otto|mans and the Ru&s;&s;ians, the latter nearly conquered the whole country. It is true that, at the conclu&s;ion of
<PB N="234" REF="238">
the peace, every thing was re&s;tored nearly to its former &s;tate; but a &s;hort time after, the quarrels of the royal family of the Khans occa&s;ioned infractions of the treaty. Upon the death of the reigning Khan, &s;everal pretenders laid claims to the vacant throne of the Crimea. A principal article of the peace was, the free and ab&s;olute independence of the Crimea, and of the election of their Khans; but of the two chief candidates, one was partially &s;upported by the Porte; of which the Ru&s;&s;ians complained as an in|fraction of the articles of independence. The memo|rials of the court of Peter&s;burgh were not li&s;tened to; upon which the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;upported vigorou&s;ly the party of the other competitor, who&s;e name was <HI>Sabil Guerai,</HI> and immediately &s;ent a body of troops into the country to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Under this ma&s;k, Ru&s;&s;ia &s;eems to have accompli&s;hed the grand project of Peter I.</P>
<P>The enemies of <HI>Guerai</HI> were overpowered, he was elected Khan, the Mu&s;&s;ulmen Tartars were ma&s;&s;acred, and Ru&s;&s;ia actually reigns in the Crimea, in the name of the prince &s;he has protected.</P>
<P>All the fortre&s;&s;es in the Crimea, are in the hands of the Ru&s;&s;ians, Kaffa not excepted; of which city, by an ancient agreement with the Tartars, the Turks were allowed to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and all their efforts
<PB N="235" REF="239">
&s;ince, to drive them out of the Crimea, have been in|effectual. This country therefore at pre&s;ent may be &s;aid to be neither &s;ubject, tributary, allied, or even friendly to the Ottoman Porte. The intere&s;t of Ru&s;&s;ia is &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Crimea, that it is &s;aid many Tartars have been baptized by the Ru&s;&s;ian prie&s;ts, and one or more of their princes have even received an order of knighthood from the Empre&s;s.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Craven,</HI> who has given a &s;hort, but &s;cientific hi&s;tory of the inhabitants of the Crimea, from the earlie&s;t ages, prefaces her intended expedition into that country from Peter&s;burgh, with &s;aying:&mdash;I am told, that the air is unwhole&s;ome, that the waters are poi&s;onous, and that I &s;hall certainly die, if I go there; but as in the great world, a new acquired country, like a new beauty, meets with detractors, I am not in the lea&s;t alarmed; for a per&s;on, not a Ru&s;&s;ian, who has been there on &s;peculation, has given me &s;o charming a de&s;cription of it, that I &s;hould not be &s;orry to purcha&s;e a Tartarian e&s;tate.</P>
<P>I will now, continued &s;he, endeavour to &s;hew by remote and pa&s;t ages, that the Taunde mu&s;t naturally become a trea&s;ure to po&s;terity.&mdash;Long before <HI>Homer,</HI> the fir&s;t inhabitants of it, as far back as can be traced, were the Cimmerians, a numerous and warlike people, de&s;cended from the Thracians; during their incur&s;ions
<PB N="236" REF="240">
into A&s;ia Minor, they were robbed of their territo|ries by the Scythians, but pre&s;erved the Crimea longer than the re&s;t. The Scythians, however, drove them from the flat country in the &s;ixth century, prior to the birth of our Saviour; but they remained concealed in the mountains, calling them&s;elves <HI>Taourians,</HI> and from thence the penin&s;ula took the name of Taourica, Taourinia, or Tauris.</P>
<P>About 480 years before the birth of Chri&s;t, the people from Mitylene founded a monarchy in the Crimea, which was governed forty-two years after|wards by Spartaeus. This king and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, we are told, favoured the Greeks, and in a great mea&s;ure drove away the Scythians, who were after|wards entirely exterminated by the Samaritans. At this period the Taourians from the mountains mo|le&s;ted the new monarchy; till <HI>Mithridates,</HI> king of Pontus &s;ubdued them, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole penin&s;ula. About the birth of Chri&s;t, the <HI>Alains</HI> made the kings, who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the Bo&s;phorus, his tributaries, and drove away the Taou|rians. The&s;e new ma&s;ters held their power about a century and a half. In the &s;econd century the Goths &s;ucceeded them; and it was under their do|minion that Chri&s;tianity was fir&s;t introduced into the Crimea. The Goths were afterwards obliged to &s;ub|mit to the Huns, and like all other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the
<PB N="237" REF="241">
Crimea, when driven from the plains, they in their turn took refuge in the mountains, where they had their own &s;overeigns, who were Chri&s;tians. In this manner they remained with &s;eparate principalities, till the &s;ixteenth century; being tributary &s;ometimes to one prince, and &s;ometimes to another; when they were finally &s;ubdued by the Turks, and garri&s;ons placed in all the principal cities. They likewi&s;e drove the Genoe&s;e from Kaffa, the principal town in the Crimea, where they had carried on a very ex|ten&s;ive commerce for two or three centuries; and forced the Tartars, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the plains, to be for &s;ome time tributary to them.</P>
<P>The great market for Circa&s;&s;ians, of which we have heard &s;o much, and know &s;o little, &s;ays Lady <HI>Craven,</HI> was at Kaffa; where they came and &s;old their chil|dren to Greeks, Genoe&s;e, Jews, or Armenians, who &s;old them in their turn at Con&s;tantinople; but that was before the Turks had extended their power over the Crimea.</P>
<P>When the &s;overeignty of the penin&s;ula pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>Mengheli-Gherai,</HI> chief of the Tartars, there were but few Tartarian inhabitants; but the wars he was en|gaged in again&s;t them, on the borders of the Volga, gave him an opportunity to bring back with him into the Crimea many thou&s;and Noguais, whom he obliged
<PB N="238" REF="242">
to fix there. He was followed in this method of peopling the country by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who furni&s;hed the <HI>Kouban,</HI> and the country between the Don and the Dnei&s;ter, with their pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>It was in the thirteenth century, that the inhabi|tants of the plains in the Crimea were &s;ubdued by the Mongouls, or Tartars, who were governed in clans by their princes, till <HI>Mengheli-Gherai</HI> converted the Crimea into a kind of &s;tate. The Goths paid a tri|bute to the&s;e people, as they had before done to the <HI>Polou&s;es,</HI> who were &s;ettled in the plains, and whom the Tartars had conquered. In the fir&s;t part of the Tartarian reign, a number of Kafes, or Circa&s;&s;ians, e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in the Crimea; with whom the Tartars carried on a great trade in the town of Krim, from thence the penin&s;ula took its name, by which only it is known to the Orientals at this hour. While the Latins were ma&s;ters of Con&s;tantinople, they car|ried on a con&s;iderable trade there, as did likewi&s;e the Venetians. But the Genoe&s;e having, by a treaty with one of the Greek emperors named <HI>Paleologus,</HI> ob|tained an exemption of all duties in the Grecian &s;tates, and a free navigation of the Black Sea, they began to monopolize all the trade of the Crimea. Bloody wars en&s;ued, in which they were almo&s;t con|&s;tantly victorious; and they rebuilt, with the con&s;ent of the Mongoul Khan, the town of Kaffa, made it

the chief repo&s;itory of their commerce, and at la&s;t of &s;uch con&s;equence that Kaffa for a time was the name by which the penin&s;ula was called. It is true, they paid tribute to the Mongouls, while the&s;e pre&s;erved their power; but when their own inte&s;tine divi&s;ions had weakened it, the Genoe&s;e &s;hook off their yoke, and the Mongoulian or Tartarian princes were even elected, or depo&s;ed, as the Genoe&s;e thought fit. At this period, the trade from India to the Crimea was di|vided into two branches by the Amon, the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, and A&s;trachan; one ended at Tana; the other proceeded by Bagdad and Tauris, to Trave&s;pond and Sava&s;topolis. Tana belonged to the Genoe&s;e and Venetians, under the &s;upremacy of the Mongouls; the Genoe&s;e having con&s;uls at the&s;e two latter places.</P>
<P>The Crimea was for a long time a formidable power to the Ru&s;&s;ians and Poles, till the&s;e nations became improved in military &s;cience. Until the peace of Carlowitz, both the&s;e countries were obliged to pay to the Khan&punc; to the amount of 100,000 rix-dollars annually, to in&s;ure their countries from the incur&s;ions of the Tartars. Ru&s;&s;ia, however, has gained ground by degrees, and by arms and policy ma&s;ter of the penin&s;ula; the la&s;t Khan has a pen&s;ion from the Empre&s;s, and is retired to live as a private gentle|man. Long before he re&s;igned his &s;overeignty; the Turki&s;h cabinet on one &s;ide, and the crafty po|licy
<PB N="240" REF="244">
of the Ru&s;&s;ians on the other, left him no peace; even &s;ome hordes of Tartars in&s;ulted his tottering power. At pre&s;ent there are about 30,000 of the Empre&s;s's troops in that country, be&s;ides about 5,000 Co&s;&s;acks in her pay; and the Khan's palaces, with &s;ome hou&s;es of the Tartarian nobles, are fitted up for her reception, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould chu&s;e to vi&s;it that country.</P>
<P>The meteors, which the heavens here continually pre&s;ent, as well as the whitene&s;s of the Aurora Bo|realis, prove the purity of the atmo&s;phere. We may al&s;o attribute, what we may venture to call its ethereal qualities, to the immen&s;e dry plains, which extend on the north of this country, and to the neighbourhood of Mount Cauca&s;us; the heights of which attract and ab&s;orb all the vapours which ri&s;e to the we&s;t.</P>
<P>Regular &s;ea&s;ons, which gradually &s;ucceed each other, contribute with the goodne&s;s of the &s;oil, to produce the mo&s;t abundant vegetation. The &s;ame kind of black land, mixed with &s;and, extends from Leopold, in Red Ru&s;&s;ia, as far as the Penin&s;ula. The heat of the &s;un fructifies every kind of grain with very little labour from the hu&s;bandman, who does nothing but plow the land he means to &s;ow. Melon-&s;eed, with peas and beans mixed, are &s;cattered by a
<PB N="241" REF="245">
man who follows the plough. They do not even cover the grain, but depend upon the rain to labour for them; and the &s;oil is abandoned to chance till harve&s;t-time, when they endeavour to clear the crop of the confu&s;ion which this mixture of &s;eed renders inevitable.</P>
<P>Among the numerous productions which &s;ponta|neou&s;ly over&s;pread the face of the Crimea, a&s;paragus, walnuts, and filberts, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their &s;ize. The abundance of flowers is equally remarkable. Entire fields covered by the &s;mall tulip, form, from the variety of their colours, the mo&s;t agreeable pictures.</P>
<P>The manner in which the vine is cultivated in the Crimea, &s;erves not to meliorate the quality of the grape; and we &s;ee with regret, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> that the fine&s;t &s;ituations in the world cannot deter|mine the inhabitants to prefer them to the vallies. The &s;lips are planted in furrows of eight or ten feet diameter, and four or five feet deep. The &s;uperior part of the&s;e ditches &s;erves to &s;u&s;tain the branches; which thus &s;upported, cover the whole orifice with foliage, under which hang the grapes, that by this means are hid from the &s;un; they are likewi&s;e abun|dantly fed by an ever humid &s;oil, and moreover are often &s;teeped in the rain-water there collected. They
<PB N="242" REF="246">
&s;trip off the leaves a month before the vintage, after which they take care to cut the vine near the ground, and the vineyards remain, during winter, under water, owing to the inundation of &s;mall rivers.</P>
<P><HI>Pey&s;onnel,</HI> in a &s;tricture upon Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> who complains of the badne&s;s of the bread in the Crimea, &s;ays, during the four years he re&s;ided at Bagtche&s;erai, one of its principal towns, he eat very good bread, which was all made by a Tartarian baker. This bread was in cakes near an ell long, very thin, very light, and perfectly well ta&s;ted. I drank al&s;o an excellent white wine, &s;ays he, of the growth of the country; great quantities of which are brought every year by the Co&s;&s;acks of the Ukrain, and the Ru&s;&s;ians, and may be compared with our <HI>vin de Chabli.</HI> I al&s;o found there in great abundance, and extremely cheap, turkeys, fowls, pullets, gee&s;e, and all &s;orts of poul|try. I cannot conceive, &s;ays the above author, what were become of the hares, partridges, wild ducks, bu&s;tards, wood-pigeons, plover, lapwings, &s;nipes, quails, and thru&s;hes, with which we were &s;o &s;urfeited, as frequently to prefer butchers meat, and even &s;alt provi&s;ions to the&s;e dainties; nor where were the fre&s;h cod and oy&s;ters, with which Kaffa &s;o frequently and abundantly furni&s;hes the inland towns; the fi&s;h of Baliklava, the trout of the river Katchi, and the fine lob&s;ters of the brook Boulganak, the melons and
<PB N="243" REF="247">
water-melons, finer and better than tho&s;e of Pro|vence; the excellent and enormous cucumbers, as large as our long gourds, the artichoaks, or the a&s;|paragus, the large&s;t and &s;weete&s;t in the world. The man who is di&s;&s;atisfied in the mid&s;t of &s;uch plenty, ought only to accu&s;e his own ab&s;tinence. or want of care. His reproaching the Tartars with not being able to make butter, is the more unju&s;t, becau&s;e butter is one of the principal articles of their commerce. The Crimea produces, annually, about three or four thou&s;and quintals of this commodity, which are equal to five thou&s;and of our quintals. Nearly as much is made by the Noguais of Djam|boilook, and the &s;ame quantity by tho&s;e of Kouban. The be&s;t &s;ort, called the flower of butter, in the Turki&s;h language, is that with which the Grand Sig|nior is &s;upplied; and a man mu&s;t be no le&s;s unfortu|nate to want butter, in the Crimea, than to be un|able to procure wine in Burgundy, or oil in Pro|vence. Lady <HI>Craven</HI> likewi&s;e te&s;tifies to the excel|lence of the butter in the Crimea.</P>
<P>Among the various &s;pecies of tho&s;e birds, which abound in the Crimea, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> the mo&s;t remarkable is a kind of wild-goo&s;e, with larger legs than ours, and a plumage of a bright bri&s;k colour. The Tartars pretend the fle&s;h of this animal is exceedingly dan|gerous. I ta&s;ted it, &s;ays the Baron, and only found it good for nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="248">No country, he adds, has more quails than the Crimea, and the&s;e birds, di&s;per&s;ed during the fine weather, a&s;&s;emble at the approach of autumn, to cro&s;s the Black Sea over to the &s;outhern coa&s;t, whence they afterwards tran&s;port them&s;elves into hotter cli|mates. The order of this emigration is invariable. Towards the end of Augu&s;t, the quails, in a body, chu&s;e one of tho&s;e &s;erene days when the wind, blow|ing from the north at &s;un-&s;et, promi&s;es them a fine night. They repair to the Strand, take their depar|ture at &s;ix or &s;even in the evening, and fini&s;h a journey of fifty leagues by break of day. Nets are &s;pread on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, and the &s;port&s;men are in waiting for their arrival to take tythe of the emigrants.</P>
<P>Though the quantity of water is great in the Crimea, it forms no con&s;iderable rivers; the proximity of the &s;ea &s;uffers no current to be more than a brook; the &s;tronge&s;t heats, never leave the channels dry, and the inhabitants, every where find limpid &s;treams, which meander agreeably through the meadows, and wander among the rocks. The Italian poplar flou|ri&s;hes here, and are numerous enough to make us &s;uppo&s;e it a native of the Crimea, if the Genoe&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments did not indicate by whom it may have been tran&s;planted.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="249">The fir&s;t ob&s;ervation of natural curio&s;ity which pre&s;ents it&s;elf in the Crimea, is the uniformity of a bed of rocks, which is found on the tops of all the mountains of the &s;ame level. The&s;e rocks, which ri&s;e more or le&s;s to the &s;urface, afford indi&s;putable traces of water, and bear the character of tho&s;e which are at pre&s;ent expo&s;ed to the efforts of the &s;ea. They are likewi&s;e apparently inter&s;per&s;ed with fo&s;&s;il oy&s;ters, but &s;o enveloped as not to be procured but by the aid of the chi&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Among the fo&s;&s;ils, which adhere to the&s;e rocks, there is likewi&s;e the <HI>Echinus marinus,</HI> or &s;ea urchin; the living &s;pecies of which is peculiar to the Red Sea. The vallies of that part of the Crimea contain exten|&s;ive beds of univalve fo&s;&s;ils, and almo&s;t all of the &s;pecies called Chine&s;e bonnets. The&s;e fo&s;&s;ils differ from tho&s;e found in the Mediterranean, by the &s;u|perior thickne&s;s of the &s;hell. So abundant are the&s;e &s;hells in &s;ome vallies, that they ab&s;olutely &s;tifle vege|tation. They are mixed with fragments of &s;oft gravel, infoliated and herberi&s;ed, the principal bed of which is &s;een in the bottom of little gutters.</P>
<P>The plains of the Noguais, which extend along the continent of the Crimea, are almo&s;t on a level with the &s;ea, whereas the i&s;thmus is from thirty to forty feet more elevated. This &s;uperior plain occu|pies
<PB N="246" REF="250">
the northern half of the penin&s;ula, after which the land, inter&s;ected by rocks, and loaded with moun|tains, running from we&s;t to ea&s;t, is overlooked by the Tchadir-Daegue, or the Tent-mountain. This mountain, placed too near the &s;ea, for its ba&s;e to add much to its elevation, can only be cla&s;&s;ed in the &s;econd order of mountains. But if we ca&s;t an eye over the map, we &s;hall perceive in it that chain which connects the Alps with Mount Cauca&s;us. In fact we behold a branch of the Apennines, which traver&s;e Europe from we&s;t to ea&s;t; &s;eparate Ger|many from Italy, Poland from Hungary, and Walla|chia from ancient Thrace; and after plunging in the Black Sea, re-appear in the &s;ame line, on the &s;outhern coa&s;t of the Crimea; &s;carcely leaving a pa&s;|&s;age for the communication of the &s;ea of A&s;oph, and the Euxine; then continuing their route to the Ca&s;|pian &s;ea, under the name of Cauca&s;us, take after|wards that of Thibet, and extend them&s;elves to the very ea&s;tern borders of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>The&s;e re&s;earches into pri&s;tine geography, while they a&s;&s;ert the progre&s;s of knowledge, will no doubt ca&s;t a new light on an argument which the &s;pirit of &s;y&s;tem has long &s;ince &s;u&s;tained. The learned, who &s;hall be curious to know the fir&s;t a&s;pect of our globe, will find it by following the &s;ame level, the traces of which are every where di&s;tinct. The highe&s;t moun|tains

will afford them tho&s;e levels which were fir&s;t abandoned by the waters.</P>
<P>The towns of mo&s;t note in the Crimea are, Kaffa, Bachtche&s;eray, the ancient re&s;idence of the Khans, and Perekop, or Orcapi, a fortified place on the i&s;thmus, which joins the penin&s;ula with the main land.</P>
<P>It is probable that the town of Kaffa, which is &s;till the centre of commerce in the Crimea, was likewi&s;e the place of greate&s;t trade among the Genoe&s;e. Yet, con&s;idering the port of Baluklava, and &s;ometimes of ancient edifices to be &s;een there, one is led to &s;up|po&s;e they did not neglect the advantages it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. The inhabitants of Kaffa, con&s;i&s;t of Greeks, Turks, and Jews, but the Greeks con&s;titute the majority, and enjoy a perfect freedom of religion, even under the Khans. Here are &s;till &s;everal de&s;cendants of the old noble families of Genoa. This town is the large&s;t of all the Crimea, and contains between five and &s;ix thou&s;and hou&s;es. North we&s;t of it, are &s;ome very high mountains, at the foot of which this town &s;tands in a very delightful &s;ituation. It retains a great deal of its ancient beauty, and the walls that were built by the Genoe&s;e, are yet remaining, in many parts of which are to be &s;een their Latin in|&s;criptions. The fine&s;t Chri&s;tian churches, mo&s;t of
<PB N="248" REF="252">
which were built likewi&s;e by the Genoe&s;e, have been converted into mo&s;ques. Their arms &s;till appear upon many of them, as likewi&s;e the painted pieces of their &s;aints, but their &s;tatues and altars have been de&s;troyed by the Greeks.</P>
<P>Bactche&s;erai is the re&s;idence of the Cham of the Tartars, and though now con&s;idered as the capital of the Crimea, was formerly only a country &s;eat, called the palace of the gardens. the &s;overeigns having fixed their re&s;idence in this place, attracted inhabi|tants to it; and the city pre&s;erving its name, has u&s;urped precedency over the ancient town, which is now only a poor village, the former importance of which can only be gathered from its tombs.</P>
<P>This town lies on the we&s;t &s;ide of the penin&s;ula, near the &s;ea, and is &s;ituated between two hills, which &s;erve to defend the place in&s;tead of walls. This town, &s;ays Lady <HI>Craven,</HI> is &s;ituated in &s;o &s;teep a valley, that &s;ome of the hanging pieces of rock &s;eem ready to fall and cru&s;h the hou&s;es.</P>
<P>In my way hither, &s;ays &s;he, I dined at the Co&s;&s;ack's chief po&s;t, and my entertainment was truly Co&s;&s;ack; a long table for thirty people, at one end a half-grown pig roa&s;ted whole; at the other, a half-grown &s;heep, whole likewi&s;e; in the middle of the table, an
<PB N="249" REF="253">
immen&s;e tureen of curdled milk; there were &s;everal &s;ide-di&s;hes made for me and the Ru&s;&s;ians, as well as the cook could imagine to our ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The old warrior, with whom I dined, would fain have made me ta&s;te above thirty &s;orts of wine, from his country, on the borders of the Don; but I con|tented my&s;elf with three or four, all of which were very good. After dinner, from the windows, I &s;aw a fine mock battle between the Co&s;&s;acks; among which were three Calmucks, the uglie&s;t fierce&s;t looking men imaginable, with their eyes &s;et in their head, in|clining down to their no&s;e; and having uncommonly &s;quare jaw-bones. The&s;e Calmucks are &s;o dexter|ous with bows and arrows, that one killed a goo&s;e at a hundred paces, another broke an egg at fifty. The officers of the Co&s;&s;acks &s;ung and danced, but their tones were equally in&s;ipid, and void of grace and harmony.</P>
<P>When a Co&s;&s;ack is &s;ick, he drinks four milk for a few days; and this is the only remedy they have for a fever.</P>
<P>At night I lodged at a hou&s;e that had belonged to a noble Tartar, where there is a Ru&s;&s;ian po&s;t, with about twelve hundred of the fine&s;t men I ever &s;aw, and uncommonly tall. A Tartarian hou&s;e has always
<PB N="250" REF="254">
another building at a little di&s;tance from it, for the convenience of travellers or &s;trangers, whom the noble Tartar always treats with the greate&s;t ho&s;pi|tality. The palace inhabited by the Khan, built fir&s;t in the Chine&s;e &s;tile, and afterwards repaired in the Turki&s;h, pre&s;erved &s;ome of the beauties of its fir&s;t con&s;truction. It &s;tands on the out&s;ide of the town, and is &s;urrounded by very high rocks, where water abounds, which is di&s;tributed through the Kio&s;ks and the gardens, in a very agreeable manner. This &s;ituation has one defect; it pre&s;ents no other pro&s;|pect than barren rocks, and the Khan is obliged to walk to the neighbouring heights, in order to enjoy a land&s;cape, but the mo&s;t beauteous and variegated.</P>
<P>The palace is an irregular building; the greate&s;t part of it is one floor, rai&s;ed upon pillars of wood, painted and gilt in a fanciful and lively manner; the arch, or la&s;t door-way, has very fine proportions, and a large in&s;cription in gilt letters as its principal ornament. Court within court, and gardens within gardens, make a variety of apartments through which the Khan u&s;ed to walk from his own re&s;idence to the Harem, which is &s;pacious and higher than the other buildings. What had a very pretty effect was, that &s;everal of the &s;quare courts under the&s;e apart|ments were paved with marble, and have fountains in the center continually playing. The room allotted
<PB N="251" REF="255">
for my apartment, &s;ays her Lady&s;hip, was a &s;quare of more than forty feet, having two rows of windows, one above the other, on three of its &s;ides; and it was with difficulty I found a place in it to put up my bed.</P>
<P>This town contains about five thou&s;and inhabi|tants. A great trade is carried on here for blades of &s;words, hangers, and knives, many of which are &s;o well tempered as not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of Dama&s;cus. Among the other excellent produc|tions of the Crimea, there is in this neighbour|hood a mine of earth, exactly like &s;oap, reckoned very good for the &s;kin, of which the Turki&s;h ladies at Con&s;tantinople u&s;e a great quantity. The profits of this mine, which are very great, are enjoyed by a Tartar, who is married to the Kaima Khan, or prime mini&s;ter of the Khan.</P>
<P>With this lady I was invited to dine, who&s;e Ha|rem, with her hu&s;band's hou&s;e, is &s;ituated in a very romantic manner, at the foot of &s;ome very extraor|dinary rocks, from which many clear &s;prings i&s;&s;ue, that &s;upply the hou&s;es of this town, and her baths, with perpetual fre&s;h water; on the &s;ummit of the&s;e rocks there is a very &s;ingular appearance, places where im|men&s;e cables have certainly pa&s;&s;ed and been tied. The Tartarians in&s;i&s;t that the &s;ea once lay at the foot
<PB N="252" REF="256">
of them, and that &s;hips were fa&s;tened to them. We dined in the hu&s;band's apartment; a very dirty &s;habby place for &s;o rich a man. Tartarian cookery con&s;i&s;ts in much grea&s;e and honey. After dinner the Kaima Khan walked acro&s;s a court, and I was de&s;ired to follow. I did &s;o, into another court, where four women and &s;ome young girls met us, and la&s;t of all his &s;i&s;ter. Her dre&s;s was magnificent, particularly her girdle, in the front of which were two circles like bracelet lockets, and in the centres of them were two fine emeralds. She offered me a large goblet, which held two quarts, of &s;herbet, a very indifferent kind of lemonade; after that coffee, and la&s;t of all &s;weatmeats. We conver&s;ed very well by &s;igns, &s;he appeared neither old nor ugly; but how is it po&s;&s;ible to judge of a countenance hid under bad painting, and eye-brows which join into one &s;traight line, drawn acro&s;s the no&s;e?</P>
<P>I wore a <HI>chemi&s;e</HI> of two rows of very fine lace, at the bo&s;om, that I thought would &s;urprize her; but lace and every magnificence which is not gold, &s;ilver, pearls, or diamonds, I am told, pa&s;&s;es unnoticed. Linen is not much in u&s;e: their &s;hifts, and the &s;hirts of the men, are generally made of very thin &s;ilk, or &s;ilk mixed with cotton, which is &s;eldom changed; but the very frequent u&s;e of baths makes this cu&s;tom le&s;s loath&s;ome than it would otherwi&s;e be.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="257">When &s;he had quitted the Harem, her brother &s;taid behind a little, and afterwards came up to me, ki&s;&s;ed the bottom of my gown, and pre&s;ented me a very beautiful handkerchief of his &s;i&s;ter's embroi|dery, which I was told I mu&s;t accept. It was of mu&s;lin, the borders embroidered with different co|loured &s;ilks and gold, and, what I could not compre|hend, both &s;ides are the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Perekop, &s;ituated on the i&s;thmus, in the Sclavo|nian language, &s;ignifies a cut made through any place, being derived from the ditch, dug here in very re|mote ages, acro&s;s the neck of land at the entrance of the Crimea, for the &s;ecurity of the penin&s;ula, and which has been from time to time repaired, and of late fortified.</P>
<P>Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> in his de&s;cription of this place &s;ays, we arrived here in tolerable good time, and pa&s;&s;ed the moat over a bad wooden bridge that joins the Counter&s;carp to a vaulted gate at the entrance of the platform, the porter of which every night keeps the penin&s;ula of the Crimea under lock and key. No|thing can have a grander effect than the fortifications of Orcapi, another name given to the entrance of this celebrated penin&s;ula. The works indeed, are &s;ome|what of the gigantic, but I know no place where na|ture has been better &s;econded by art. The &s;olidity
<PB N="254" REF="258">
of the entrenchments may be warranted, it inter&s;ects the i&s;thmus three quarters of a league in extent; two &s;eas &s;erve it for epaulment; it overlooks the plain beneath, about the height of forty feet, and will long re&s;i&s;t the utter negligence of ignorance. No marks indicate the time of its con&s;truction, but every thing proves it anterior to the Tartars, or at lea&s;t that they were formerly better in&s;tructed than they are at pre|&s;ent. The Ru&s;&s;ians, in the la&s;t war, could only pe|netrate the Crimea, by pa&s;&s;ing a &s;mall mar&s;hy arm of the &s;ea, and gaining the point of a very narrow neck of land, which runs parallel to the ea&s;tern coa&s;t. The &s;ame route had been &s;ucce&s;sfully attempted by General <HI>Munick,</HI> in the campaigns of 1736, and 1737; yet this could not in&s;pire the Tartars, either with the means, or the de&s;ire to pre&s;erve them&s;elves hereafter from a like misfortune, by defending the extremity of that neck of land, where the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t have &s;topped the enemy's march.</P>
<P>The &s;alt-pits of this place make part of the &s;ove|reign domains, and are farmed out either to Arme|nians, or Jews; and the&s;e two commercial na|tions, always rivalling each other, mutually rai&s;e the produce of the tax by this conte&s;t. They are equally un&s;kilful in managing their works to the be&s;t advantage, and their avarice is always the dupe of their ignorance. They have &s;heds to receive, dry,
<PB N="255" REF="259">
and pre&s;erve the natural &s;alt, formed in the &s;alt-lakes. Hence the abundance of one year, cannot compen&s;ate the deficiences of another, when the rains wa&s;h away a produce &s;o rich, and &s;o ea&s;y to &s;tow in &s;afety.</P>
<P>We cannot quit the topographical de&s;cription of the Crimea, without noticing the harbour of Seva&s;ti|copolis; from whence Lady <HI>C.</HI> took &s;hipping for Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>The &s;ingularity of the coa&s;t of the harbour, &s;ays Lady <HI>C.</HI> is unlike any other I ever &s;aw: it is a long creek that is formed by the Black Sea, between two ridges of land &s;o high, that the glory of the Catha|rine, one of the large&s;t &s;hips in the Ru&s;&s;ian navy, which was at anchor here, could not be &s;een from the land, on the &s;hore, being above the pendant. The water is &s;o deep, that this &s;hip touched the land. All the fleets in Europe would be &s;afe from &s;torms, or from enemies, in the&s;e creeks, or harbours, for there are many of them. At the upper extremity &s;tands Inkerman; which mu&s;t have formerly been a very con&s;iderable town; at pre&s;ent the only remains are rooms hewn out of the rock. Here is a large cha|pel; the pillars, and the altar of which, are ex|tremely curious: the &s;tone is whiti&s;h, and not unlike marble.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVIII.</HI> Wallachia.</HEAD>
<P>THE ancient Dace, which always had the highe&s;t reputation for the courage and valour of its people, con&s;i&s;ted of the three provinces of Tran&s;yl|vania, Moldavia and Wallachia. All the&s;e three provinces were over-run by the Germans, Polone&s;e and Turks; and not being able to hold out again&s;t &s;uch powerful neighbouring enemies, they were forced to buy the protection of the Ottoman Porte, by means of an annual tribute. Tran&s;ylvania, from
<PB N="258" REF="262">
the advantage of its &s;ituation, upon the frontiers of the territories of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, &s;ettled with the Germans, by an an annual tribute of 6,000 gold ducats. At pre&s;ent it is incorporated with the other hereditary domains of the German empire, and the Tran&s;ylvanians are very happy, in compari&s;on of the inhabitants of Moldavia and Wallachia. The other two provinces remain &s;ubject to the Porte, which &s;ends them governors elected by the Grand Signior, from among&s;t the ancient Greek families, re&s;iding at Fanari. To the&s;e governors the Porte grants the title of Vayvodes, and of Beys, and the honour of two tails, which are carried before them, when they come out of the divan of the grand vi&s;ir, after their appointment; and pa&s;s through the principal &s;treets, with a numerous and &s;plendid retinue, on their way to the capitals of their re&s;pective principalities. Their principal occupation, in their government, is col|lecting the tribute, which is generally paid to the Porte.</P>
<P>Wallachia formerly paid no more than &s;ixty thou|&s;and pia&s;tres a year. But after the rebellion of the inhabitants of this province in 1665, again&s;t the Porte, a rebellion which was only &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by a bloody victory; the annual tribute was greatly augmented, and now amounts to two hundred and forty thou&s;and pia&s;tres, or about fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="263">For this province, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> it is a very ade|quate &s;um, and the inhabitants would be happy if they could enjoy tranquility, upon paying even dou|ble, or treble that amount. But the extraordinaries which they oblige them to pay, &s;abre in hand, are ex|orbitant. The Vayvode always keeps a grand court, and a magnificent retinue. His re&s;idence is at Buc|core&s;t; no incon&s;iderable town, &s;ays Lady <HI>C.</HI> the &s;ituation of which is delightful. To obtain the government, he unavoidably contracts great debts, which he mu&s;t draw from the province; but this is not all: in order to keep him&s;elf in place, by favour of his protectors at Con&s;tantinople, he mu&s;t make them annual pre&s;ents, and he will take care to ama&s;s &s;ufficient trea&s;ures a-part for him&s;elf, again&s;t a re|moval from his government, if he is &s;o fortunate to leave it without lo&s;ing his head. To compa&s;s all the&s;e ends, the mo&s;t horrible cruelties, and extortions are con&s;tantly practi&s;ed. The inhabitants are reduced to the utmo&s;t mi&s;ery; and, not being able to live any longer under &s;uch a yoke, &s;eek for refuge in &s;ome more humane country. This humanity they experi|ence in the territories of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>The former governors of Wallachia could &s;upply all the charges of their election and inve&s;titure with le&s;s than an hundred pur&s;es; in our days they mu&s;t levy twenty times as much; &s;uch is the Ottoman
<PB N="260" REF="264">
avarice and Greek ambition. If the governors have the good fortune to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from their employ|ments with their lives, they have always the title of Bey, and their &s;ons the &s;ame. There are &s;everal of the&s;e beys at Con&s;tantinople, and the riche&s;t of them &s;carcely better than a poor man; but they po&s;&s;e&s;s, in the place of money, a very great &s;hare of pride and contempt.</P>
<P>The Wallachians, con&s;idered as inhabitants of the country, are de&s;cended from the old Roman colony, &s;ettled here by the Emperor <HI>Trajan.</HI> This is evident not only from their language, which is a barbarous Latin, intermixed with &s;everal foreign words; but likewi&s;e from their cu&s;toms and their diet; their thick pottages and onions, of which they are very fond; their dre&s;s, and attachment to the Italian lan|guage; as al&s;o to the Italians them&s;elves, and to whatever comes from their country.</P>
<P>Buccore&s;t, or Buchare&s;t, the u&s;ual re&s;idence of the Prince, is a large &s;traggling town, of a very pecu|liar form; the outward parts are very mean, con&s;i&s;t|ing of hou&s;es, the greater part of which are under ground, like our cellars, and covered on top with &s;traw, or bark of trees. The better &s;ort of hou&s;es are near the Prince's palace, and covered with hand&s;ome wooden tiles, though the walls are built of very &s;ub|&s;tantial
<PB N="261" REF="265">
&s;tone; having &s;pacious court-yards, and gar|dens to them, enclo&s;ed by trunks of oaks, &s;et as near as po&s;&s;ible to each other. The &s;treets appear like a continued bridge, being floored from &s;ide to &s;ide, with ma&s;&s;y planks of ten yards long, and as many inches thick; which work, how expen&s;ive &s;oever it may &s;eem, is continued through all the buildings of the place, for an extent of &s;ome miles. The pro&s;pect of the city is plea&s;ing at a di&s;tance, on account of the hou&s;es of the nobility, the palace of the Prince, and the number of churches and convents. The&s;e la&s;t are all of one form, regularly built, and ri&s;ing with cupolas.</P>
<P>About two miles from the town is a convent, called in the Wallachian language, the <HI>Catrochan;</HI> which is accounted the mo&s;t beautiful of &s;everal in this pro|vince; and therefore a &s;hort account of this, may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It is &s;ituated on the Dembowctza, which wa&s;hes it on two &s;ides; while the other two are adorned with a grove of lovely, clo&s;e and &s;hady oaks. The neigh|bouring pa&s;tures afford an entertaining pro&s;pect; whereas the parts near the convents, are di&s;po&s;ed into regular, well-ordered vineyards and gardens. The fabric it&s;elf is an oblong quadrangle, built of regular and ma&s;&s;ive &s;tone, divided into cells for about forty
<PB N="262" REF="266">
monks, with lodgings for the abbot, a common re|fectory, kitchen and other public apartments. But in the middle of the area is erected the chapel, of the exact figure of the ancient Greek churches, that is di&s;tingui&s;hed into the porch, outward chapel, body of the church, chancel, and altar; the &s;everal parts being regular and &s;tately, &s;upported with pillars, and covered with cupolas. The ornaments of painting, gilding and embroidery, are excceding rich; and the pictures &s;o numerou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, as to po&s;&s;e&s;s every part of the church, in the in&s;ide, as well as the out|&s;ide of the front. Here al&s;o are kept the two hor&s;es' tails, allowed by the Turks to be carried before this prince; together with the <HI>bandier</HI> of the province, and another called the pa&s;chal colours, in which the Holy Trinity is prophanely repre&s;ented; and God the Father expre&s;&s;ed by the image of a reverend old man, looking over the body of our Saviour, as it hangs upon the cro&s;s.</P>
<P>The air of this province is temperate, the &s;oil very fruitful, particularly in grain, with which it is obliged to furni&s;h the market of Con&s;tantinople, when there is a &s;carcity in Egypt. The wines of this province, &s;ays <HI>Chi&s;hull,</HI> e&s;pecially about Tergovi&s;t, are exqui|&s;itely fine. It is likewi&s;e in great repute for its mo&s;t excellent hor&s;es. The province is well watered by a con&s;iderable number of large and &s;mall rivers, which
<PB N="263" REF="267">
di&s;charge them&s;elves into the Danube, and which makes it &s;o luxuriantly rich, and abounding with woods and pa&s;tures, though but thinly inhabited; and that in caves and huts, rather than hou&s;es. Its chief income proceeds from wax, honey, hides, hor&s;es, &s;alt-mines, and the cu&s;toms on &s;ome places of the Da|nube. By the&s;e it is able to maintain its prince and barons &s;plendidly; be&s;ides paying a yearly tribute to the Turk, which is &s;ettled at three hundred and twenty pur&s;es, equal to thirty-two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; be&s;ides three times that &s;um, extorted beyond the compact. The lands of the province are entirely in the hands of the prince and barons; the re&s;t, who are pea&s;ants, being all either &s;laves or &s;ervants, who&s;e per&s;ons or &s;ervice are at the di&s;po&s;al of the &s;everal nobles, on whom they depend.</P>
<P>The prince has all the rights of &s;overeignty, ex|cept that of declaring war, and coining his own mo|ney. Ju&s;tice is here performed according to the an|cient laws of the province, which are agreeable to the Roman law. The power and act of pronouncing &s;entence, is wholly in the brea&s;t of the prince; after which, as in Turkey, the execution immediately en&s;ues. For the better adju&s;tment of tribute, and other common duties, the whole province is divided into &s;eventeen counties, of which each is to furni&s;h its re&s;pective proportion. In time of war it ordi|narily
<PB N="264" REF="268">
maintains twenty thou&s;and men, of which about the fourth part continues in pay, in time of peace.</P>
<P>The Wallachians profe&s;s the ea&s;tern Greek re|ligion, and, as in their writing, they u&s;e the &s;ame letters with the Ru&s;&s;ians, &s;o they agree with them in u&s;ing the &s;ame religious ceremonies. The common|ality are mo&s;t wretchedly ignorant, and even the highe&s;t attainments at which the eccle&s;ia&s;tics aim, &s;eldom goes beyond reading and &s;inging well.</P>
<P>The churches of each pari&s;h, as well as the chapels of many mona&s;teries, which are &s;een here, are u&s;ually very plea&s;ing to the eye, well built, richly adorned, profu&s;ely painted, and for the mo&s;t part furni&s;hed with bells, though in &s;ome places may be &s;een the wooden plank, common to the Greek churches in Turkey, where bells are not permitted. The porch of their churches is generally daubed with &s;uper&s;ti|tious repre&s;entations of the puni&s;hments of hell; and oftentimes the in&s;ide of the&s;e churches is prophaned with &s;ome incon&s;i&s;tent corporeal image of the Holy Trinity; a thing permitted here again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ed principles and declarations of the Greek church. The government of them is &s;ubject to the patriarchs of Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="269">Per&s;ons of rank, among the Wallachians, are &s;o fond of the Italian language, that they apply them|&s;elves to it more than to their mother-tongue; and generally &s;end their &s;ons to the univer&s;ity of Padua. Great numbers of the Mahometans live al&s;o inter|mixed with the Wallachians.</P>
<P>I vi&s;ited the pre&s;s of this place, &s;ays <HI>Chi&s;hull,</HI> where I found them printing &s;ome pieces of devotion in Arabic, under the care of the patriarch of Antioch, to be by him di&s;tributed about his dioce&s;e. Be&s;ides this, they were undertaking to print a large folio of the famous <HI>Maximus Hieromanachus,</HI> being the cour&s;e of the &s;everal Sundays throughout the year. On this occa&s;ion, I bought &s;everal Greek books, lately printed in this province, one of which contained all the liturgies, hymns, rituals, le&s;&s;ons, and other de|votional tracts, u&s;ed on all occa&s;ions in the Greek church, through the cour&s;e of the whole year.</P>
<P>Such of our fa&s;hionable female readers as roam in imagination to foreign courts, may probably not be a little amu&s;ed and delighted with Lady <HI>Craven</HI>'s mag|nificent reception at the court of the prince of Walla|chia. A coach, &s;ays her Lady&s;hip, made, I believe, in the year 1, came to the door, with &s;ix brown-bay &s;tone-hor&s;es, that &s;eemed to &s;purn the earth they trod on, and with grooms walking by the &s;ide of each
<PB N="266" REF="270">
of the hor&s;es. A kind of chamberlain, with a long flowing robe, embroidered all over with gold, and a white &s;taff in his hand, accompanied by the prince's private &s;ecretary, attended to conduct me. The whole town, by this time, was got round the equi-page, and we proceeded very &s;lowly to the fir&s;t court of the palace, in which I went through a double row of guards, &s;ome of them Jani&s;&s;aries, and the others Arnauts and Albanians. In the &s;econd court there was another double row of the &s;ame guards that ex|tended up a large flight of &s;teps, leading to the au|dience chamber; in the corner of which, a &s;pace was divided off with cu&s;hions, upon which &s;at the prince, dre&s;&s;ed and attended <HI>a la Turque;</HI> over his head were ranged the hor&s;es' tails, the great helmet and feather, the magnificent &s;abre, and other arms, with which I had &s;een him parade the &s;treets of Con&s;tan|tinople. Coffee and &s;weetmeats were &s;erved on my entrance; after having partook of which, and re|mained &s;ome time in conver&s;ation, I ro&s;e to take my leave; when one of his chamberlains de&s;ired me, in a whi&s;per, to &s;et down again; my ears were then immediately a&s;&s;ailed with the mo&s;t jarring noi&s;e I ever heard. Upon which, with a very grave loud voice, the &s;ecretary &s;aid, <HI>"c'e&s;t pour vous Madame, c'e&s;t la mu&s;ique du Prince,"</HI> and the prince de&s;ired me to look out into the court. There I &s;aw trumpets of all kinds, bra&s;s plates &s;triking together, and drums of
<PB N="267" REF="271">
all &s;izes; &s;ome of which, not larger than breakfa&s;t cups, were ranged on the ground, and the &s;trikers of them &s;quatted on the ground to beat them. Each mu&s;ician was endeavouring to drown the noi&s;e of his neigh|bour, by making a louder, if po&s;&s;ible; I do not know that my nerves were ever &s;o tried before. This &s;cene however, did not la&s;t long, I was then called to have an audience of the prince&s;s. She was &s;itting <HI>a la Turque,</HI> with three of her daughters by her, who were about nine, ten, and eleven years old. The prince&s;s might be about thirty, &s;he had a very hand&s;ome face, &s;omething like the Duche&s;s of Gordon, only the fea|tures and countenance of the latter have more &s;oft|ne&s;s, and her &s;kin and hair are fairer. Her per&s;on was rather fat, and &s;he was above &s;ix months ad|vanced in her eighth pregnancy. She took my hand and &s;eated me by her. There were twenty ladies, in the room, one of whom in&s;tead of a turban, had a high cap of &s;able put behind her hair, that was combed up &s;traight over a kind of roll. This head-dre&s;s was far from being ugly or unbecoming. The prince&s;s told me, it was a lady of Wallachia, and that the cap was the dre&s;s of the country. After the prince&s;s had a&s;ked me all tho&s;e que&s;tions u&s;ually put to travellers, I was de&s;ired to &s;up with them, to which I con&s;ented, but reque&s;ted I might return to my lodgings, to write to Con&s;tantinople. I &s;carcely had got home, when two of the prince's people, with the &s;ecretary came
<PB N="268" REF="272">
in, followed by many more of his hou&s;hold. The &s;ecretary de&s;ired me to go and look over a gallery that &s;urrounded the back court of the hou&s;e; I did &s;o, and &s;aw a beautiful Arabian hor&s;e, in the mid&s;t of a great mob, with two Turks holding his bridle. The &s;ecretary told me the prince hearing I was fond of hor&s;es, de&s;ired me to accept that, which a ba&s;haw of three-tails had given him, a few days before, and he hoped I &s;hould accept it with the regard with which it was pre&s;ented. I gave him as civil an an|&s;wer as I could imagine, and very hand&s;ome pre&s;ents in money to the grooms, and to the whole &s;et of &s;table-people.</P>
<P>The &s;upper was &s;erved in a more magnificent man|ner than I &s;hould have imagined; a table upon legs, and chairs to &s;it on, were things I did not expect. The prince &s;at at the end of the table, his wife on one &s;ide, and I on the other. Several ladies &s;at down to &s;upper with us. The prince&s;s had nine females be|hind her chair to wait upon her. Several &s;ilver things were &s;et upon the table accidently, the produce of England, &s;uch as &s;alt-&s;ellers, cruets, &amp;c. &amp;c. but there were four candle&s;ticks that &s;eemed to be made of alaba&s;ter, &s;et with flowers compo&s;ed of &s;mall rubies and emeralds, that were very beautiful. Dete&s;table Turki&s;h mu&s;ic was played during the whole &s;upper, but relieved now and then by Bohemians, who&s;e tunes
<PB N="269" REF="273">
were quite delightful, and might have made the heavie&s;t clod on earth de&s;ire to dance. The prince &s;aw the impre&s;&s;ion this mu&s;ic made upon me, and de|&s;ired they might play oftener than the Turks. It &s;eem, &s;ays Lady <HI>Craven,</HI> the&s;e Bohemians are born &s;laves, the property of the reigning prince of Walla|chia. There are, as he told me, five thou&s;and of them left; formerly there were five and twenty thou|&s;and. About half pa&s;t eleven, I ro&s;e to take my leave, and received from the prince&s;s &s;everal very beautiful embroidered handkerchiefs, and was obliged again to excu&s;e my&s;elf from &s;taying only a twelve-month with her, which &s;he &s;aid would be a great amu&s;ement to her, as my pre&s;ence was full of graces. I retired with all the attendants I had before, only with the addition of, I believe, a hundred flambeaux, and all the Turki&s;h and Bohemian mu&s;ic playing by the &s;ide of the large gold coach.</P>
<P>This horrid di&s;cord and comical proce&s;&s;ion got the better of my gravity; and though the &s;ecretary was there, I laughed all the way to the Con&s;ul's hou&s;e, where apartments were prepared for me. Mr. <HI>V</HI>'s ideas of good breeding, a gentleman in the carriage with me, were &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed by my laughing, that he a&s;&s;ured the &s;ecretary the <HI>perfection</HI> of my ear for mu&s;ic was &s;uch, that the lea&s;t di&s;cord in it made me laugh; and he repeated this in all the ways he could

<P>THE country comprized under the name of Little Tartary, contains, according to Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> not only the Crimea, but the Kouban; a part of Circa&s;&s;ia, and all the lands which &s;eparate the em|pire of Ru&s;&s;ia from the Black Sea. This circuit con|tinued from Moldavia, almo&s;t to Taganrog, is from thirty to forty leagues wide, and nearly two hundred long. From ea&s;t to we&s;t, it includes Yetitchekoolai, Dgamboylook, Yede&s;an, and Be&s;&s;arabia. This latter province is inhabited by Tartars; who, as well as tho&s;e of the Crimea, have fixed habitations in their villages; but the inhabitants of the three other pro|vinces have only felt tents, which they carry where|ever they plea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="275">Tho&s;e people called Noguais Tartars, are &s;ettled in the vallies that traver&s;e their plains from north to &s;outh, and their tents, ranged in a &s;ingle line, form there a kind of villages of thirty and thirty-five leagues in length, which di&s;tingui&s;h the different hordes.</P>
<P>It may be pre&s;umed that the ru&s;tic, frugal life, which the&s;e people lead, favours population; as it is ob&s;erved that the people are le&s;s numerous, un|der the roofs of the Crimea, and in the provinces of Be&s;&s;arabia, than in the tents of the Noguais. The be&s;t calculation we can make is, from a view of the military forces which the Cham is able to a&s;|&s;emble. This number, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> during his re&s;idence in that country, amounted to 200,000 men; and the Baron adds, that the Cham was able to rai&s;e double that number, without prejudice to the nece&s;|&s;ary labours of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The revenues of the Cham, notwith&s;tanding the numerous armies he can bring into the field, &s;carce amounts to 25,000 pounds &s;terling, for the main|tenance of his hou&s;hold. The rai&s;ing of forces is no expence to him. All e&s;tates are held by military tenure. Neither does the Sovereign &s;upport any ex|pence of ju&s;tice; he decides all di&s;putes, throughout his &s;tates gratis; as each juri&s;diction does, in its re&s;pective di&s;tricts.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="276">The Cham of the Crimea, though &s;overeign over the&s;e provinces, is only &s;o in the nature of Lord Pa|ramount. The&s;e provinces have their nobility, whom the Cham is obliged to convoke, on all extraordinary occa&s;ions; the government retaining the old feudal &s;y&s;tem, e&s;tabli&s;hed in Europe &s;ome centuries back, and to which it is &s;uppp&s;ed the&s;e Tartars gave ri&s;e.</P>
<P>The towns of mo&s;t note in the&s;e provinces are Bender, a Turki&s;h fortification on the Dnie&s;ter, fa|mous for the retreat of <HI>Charles</HI> XII. in 1709, after the battle of Pultawa, where he remained four years; and Oczakow, taken from the Turks, in the la&s;t war between them and the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>Oczakow is a very &s;trong place, &s;ituated at the in|flux of the Dnieper, into the Black Sea. It receives its Turki&s;h name from the Dnieper, by the Turks, called Ozi, and lies on the declivity of a mountain, with a ca&s;tle above it. When Count <HI>Munich</HI> &s;at down before it in the year 1737, its fortifications were in excellent order, and its garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of a large body of cho&s;en Turki&s;h forces; but the Count, com|pelled by want of fodder for the hor&s;es and other cattle, ri&s;qued an a&s;&s;ault, and carried it the third day after opening the trenches. The Ru&s;&s;ians held the place till the following year, when they evacuated it, after having demoli&s;hed the works.</P>

<P>The Bori&s;thenes, the ancient name given to the Dnieper, the entrance of which river this citadel is meant to defend, is confined and narrow towards its mouth, by a projection of land on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, called Kilboornoo, by and within which, a kind of lake is formed, lengthened towards the north, from whence the river de&s;cends. Its width is more than two leagues from Oczakow to the oppo&s;ite fort, &s;ituated on the &s;andy point, in which direction it is u&s;ual to cro&s;s the Bori&s;thenes. The ve&s;&s;els u&s;ed on the&s;e occa&s;ions, carry &s;ail when the wind is favour|able, and are pu&s;hed al&s;o with boat-hooks, owing to the &s;hallowne&s;s of the water, which is never too deep to make u&s;e of them, except for a few fathoms to|wards the middle.</P>
<P>After three hours of this tire&s;ome navigation, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> who cro&s;&s;ed this river in his way to the Crimea, we landed at Kilboornoo, oppo&s;ite the ca&s;tle. Its
<PB N="274" REF="278">
artillery, de&s;tined to co-operate with that of Oczakow, in defending the river, could not &s;end its fire to a &s;ufficient di&s;tance, but mu&s;t always permit an entrance through the middle. Were batteries &s;ituated on Kil|boornoo point, and others on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, they would con&s;tantly &s;ecure the entrance of the river again&s;t every kind of ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The country, between the Dnie&s;ter and the Dnieper, by &s;ome called Yede&s;an, and by others Oczakow Tartary, is inhabited only along the&s;e two rivers, and near the &s;ea, the other parts being quite wa&s;te, and therefore called Dzike Pole, or the de&s;art plain. It affords, however, good pa&s;ture, but has not a &s;ingle tree upon it. In the year 1709, after the unfortu|nate battle of Pultawa, <HI>Charles</HI> XII. travelled over it in his road to Turkey, &s;uffering inexpre&s;&s;ible hard|&s;hips by the way.</P>
<P>Such is the only information we have been able to collect re&s;pecting this fortre&s;s, the retention of which Ru&s;&s;ia thought a &s;ufficient equivalent for the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es of a glorious war; it was, however, &s;o &s;trongly oppo&s;ed on the part of the Turks, by the mediatory powers of Pru&s;&s;ia and England, before it was con|&s;ented to be yielded up to them, as nearly to have embroiled all Europe in war; and which nothing per|haps prevented, being more &s;trongly conte&s;ted by the
<PB N="275" REF="279">
mediating powers, but the unwillingne&s;s of the lower cla&s;s of people in this country, to our being engaged in a war with Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The importance of this fortre&s;s to Ru&s;&s;ia, mu&s;t be very evident, when it is con&s;idered that it commands the entrance of a river, in which are her principal docks for building &s;hips, to navigate the Black Sea; and from whence all her naval &s;tores mu&s;t de&s;cend to furni&s;h the harbours of the Crimea.</P>
<P>I&s;mahel, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> a town of Be&s;&s;arabia, on the left of the Danube, near its mouth, &s;erves as a maga|zine for the &s;ending corn down the Danube, and fur|ther adds a &s;pecies of indu&s;try peculiar to it&s;elf; which is the manufacturing of &s;hagreen &s;kins, called by us, Turki&s;h &s;hagreen. Here are places round the town &s;et apart for dre&s;&s;ing them. At fir&s;t they are worked like parchment, and are &s;u&s;tained in the air horizontally, by four poles, &s;o di&s;po&s;ed that they may receive the impre&s;&s;ion of a very a&s;tringent little grain, with which they are covered; after &s;tanding a certain time, they are found perfectly prepared and fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the barren picture which the&s;e countries con&s;tantly offer, and the facility with which a compari&s;on might be drawn between this &s;oil, and
<PB N="276" REF="280">
that of Moldavia and Poland, yet &s;uch is the force of of habit, that it vanqui&s;hes all &s;en&s;ations. The No|guais conceive it impo&s;&s;ible to traver&s;e their plains without envying them their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. You have travelled a great way, &s;aid one of the Tartars to Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> but did you ever &s;ee a country like ours?</P>
<P>The plains we cro&s;&s;ed, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> in the memoirs of his journey from Moldavia into the Crimea, were &s;o level and open, that no irregularity could be &s;een, not &s;o much as a tree or a &s;hrub. It was now near &s;un-&s;et, &s;ays the Baron, and I &s;aw nothing before me but a va&s;t melancholy plain, when I &s;uddenly felt my carriage de&s;cend, and beheld a file of tents to the right and left, extending further than the eye could &s;ee.</P>
<P>The&s;e vallies which inter&s;ect the plains from north to &s;outh, are about eight or ten fathoms deep, and though more than thirty leagues long, are but half a quarter of a league wide. Muddy rivulets run through the middle of them, and terminate towards the &s;outh in lakes, which communicate with the Black Sea.</P>
<P>On the borders of the&s;e rivulets are the tents of the Noguais, as well as the &s;heds meant to give &s;helter, during winter, to the numerous flocks and
<PB N="277" REF="281">
herds of the&s;e pa&s;toral people. Each proprietor has his own mark, which is burnt into the thighs of hor&s;es, oxen, and dromedaries, and painted with colours on the wool of &s;heep. The latter are kept near the owner's habitation, but the other &s;pecies united into herds, are towards the &s;pring driven to the plains, where they are left at large till the winter, when they &s;eek them out, and drive them to their &s;heds.</P>
<P>What is mo&s;t &s;ingular, is, that the Tartar em|ployed in this &s;earch, has always an extent of plain, which from one valley to another, is ten or twelve leagues wide, and more than thirty long, yet does not know which way to direct his &s;earch, nor troubles him&s;elf about it. He puts up into a bag &s;ix pounds of the flour of roa&s;ted millet, which is &s;ufficient to la&s;t him thirty days. This provi&s;ion made, he mounts his hor&s;e, &s;tops not till the &s;un goes down, then clogs the animal, leaves him to graze, &s;ups on his flour, goes to &s;leep, awakes and continues his route. He neglects not, however, to ob&s;erve as he rides, the mark of the herd he happens to &s;ee. The&s;e di&s;|coveries he communicates to the different Noguais he meets, who have the &s;ame pur&s;uits, and in his turn receives &s;uch indications as help to put an end to his journey. It is certainly to be feared, &s;ays the Baron, that a people &s;o patient, may one day furni&s;h formi|dable armies.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="282">No appearance of culture is to be &s;een on any route, becau&s;e the Tartars avoid the cultivation of frequented places. Their harve&s;t, on the &s;ide of roads, would &s;erve only as pa&s;ture to travellers' hor&s;es. But if this precaution pre&s;erve them from this kind of depredation, nothing can protect their fields from a much more fatal &s;courge. Clouds of locu&s;ts fre|quently alight on their plains; and, giving the pre|ference to their fields of millet, ravage them in an in&s;tant. Their approach darkens the horizon; and &s;o enormous is their multitude, as to hide the light of the &s;un. When the hu&s;bandmen happen to be &s;uffi|ciently numerous, they &s;ometimes divert the &s;torm, by the agitation of their cries; but when the&s;e fail, the locu&s;ts alight on their fields, and the&s;e form a bed of &s;ix or &s;even inches thick. To the noi&s;e of their flight, &s;ucceeds that of their devouring activity; it re&s;embles the rattling of hail-&s;tones; but its con&s;e|quences are infinitely more de&s;tructive. Fire it&s;elf eats not &s;o fa&s;t; nor is there a ve&s;tige of vegetation to be found, when they again take their flight, and go el&s;ewhere to produce fre&s;h di&s;a&s;ters.</P>
<P>The &s;hores of the Pontus-Euxenus, towards the Bo&s;phorus of Thrace, are &s;ometimes covered half leg deep, with their dry remains. Curious to know the true cau&s;e of their de&s;truction, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> I &s;ought the moment of ob&s;ervation, and was witne&s;s of their
<PB N="279" REF="283">
ruin by a &s;torm, which overtook them &s;o near the &s;hore, that their bodies were ca&s;t upon the land, whil&s;t yet entire. This produced an infection &s;o great, that it was &s;everal days before they could be approached.</P>
<P>No people, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> are more ab&s;temious; millet and mare's milk are their habitual food; and yet they are exceedingly carniverous. A Noguais might wager, that he would eat a whole &s;heep, and gain his bet, without danger of indi&s;cretion. But their appetites are re&s;trained by their avarice; which is &s;o great, that they generally debar them&s;elves of every thing they can &s;ell. If any accident &s;hould kill one of their cattle, &s;ays the Baron, they then only regale upon his fle&s;h; and this not unle&s;s they find it time enough to bleed the dead animal. They follow this precept of <HI>Mahomet</HI> likewi&s;e, with re&s;pect to bea&s;ts that are di&s;tempered; carefully ob&s;erving each &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, that they may &s;eize the moment when, in their avarice, condemned to lo&s;e the value of the bea&s;t, their appetite may &s;till afford them &s;ome con&s;olation, by killing it an in&s;tant before its natural death.</P>
<P>The fairs of Balta, and others e&s;tabli&s;hed on their frontiers, are the emporium to which they annually bring their immen&s;e flocks and herds. The corn they grow, in &s;uch abundance, finds a ready vent by
<PB N="280" REF="284">
the Black Sea, as well as their fleeces. To the&s;e ob|jects of commerce, are added &s;ome bad hides, and great quantities of hare-&s;kins.</P>
<P>The&s;e different articles united, annually produce the Tartars con&s;iderable &s;ums, which they only receive in ducats of gold, Dutch or Venetian; but the u&s;e they make of the&s;e annihilates every idea of wealth. They are continually augmenting, without turning any part of their &s;tore into circulation. Avarice &s;eizes and engluts the&s;e trea&s;ures, while the plains in which they are buried, afford not the lea&s;t indication or guide, to future re&s;earch.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the avarice of the Noguais Tartars, the ho&s;pitality of the inhabitants of Be&s;&s;arabia ap|pears to have been equally in the extreme. We ar|rived, before dark, at a village in Be&s;&s;arabia, &s;ays the above author, at which my conductor intended we &s;hould &s;leep. He &s;topped in the mid&s;t of an open place, &s;urrounded by hou&s;es, where I remarked each inhabitant &s;tood at his door, with eyes fixed on us; while the Tchoadar, looking round, examined them, one after another.</P>
<P>Where are we to lodge? &s;aid I; I do not &s;ee that any one cares. You are mi&s;taken, an&s;wered he. Every one is waiting, and wi&s;hing for the preference;
<PB N="281" REF="285">
who&s;ever hou&s;e you &s;hall wi&s;h to fix upon, you will make the ma&s;ter happy.</P>
<P>During this di&s;cour&s;e, I ob&s;erved an old man, &s;tanding &s;ingly, before his door. His venerable air intere&s;ted me. The lot fell upon him; and no &s;ooner was the choice made, than all the inhabitants re-en|tered their hou&s;es. The ardour of my new ho&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction; and, as &s;oon as he had &s;hewn me into a clean lower apartment, he brought his wife and daughter, both with their faces uncovered; the fir&s;t carrying a ba&s;on and a pitcher, and the &s;econd a napkin; which &s;he &s;pread over my hands, after I had wa&s;hed them.</P>
<P>Pre-informed by my conductor, I &s;ubmitted, with|out difficulty, to what ho&s;pitality dictated to the&s;e good people. After ordering &s;upper, and leaving the care of preparing it to the women; the old man, who till then had &s;uppo&s;ed me a Tartarian nobleman, undeceived by the Tchoadar, came immediately, to beg I would excu&s;e the &s;mall means he had of re|ceiving me properly. My an&s;wer made him ea&s;y; and, as I wi&s;hed to que&s;tion him on the &s;urround|ing objects, I obliged him to &s;it down, &s;moke, and partake of &s;ome coffee, which my &s;ervant had brought.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="286">This little civility, which a Tartarian nobleman would certainly not have paid my ho&s;t, confirmed him in his inclination towards me. I then de&s;ired him to tell me why, with a view &s;olely of exerci&s;ing ho&s;pitality, they &s;ubjected them&s;elves to a cu&s;tom, the inconvenience of which he at pre&s;ent found; and which might ruin the mo&s;t wealthy individual; if, by chance, the choice of travellers &s;hould frequently light on him only.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feel, in the preference you have given me, nothing but the plea&s;ure of having obtained it. We con&s;ider the exerci&s;e of ho&s;pitality as a benefit; and &s;hould any one con&s;tantly enjoy that advantage, he could only make others jealous; but we do not permit the u&s;e of any means, which might determine the choice of travellers. Our eagerne&s;s to come to our doors, is only to prove that our hou&s;es are in|habited; their uniformity pre&s;erves an equality, and my good &s;tar alone, has procured me the happine&s;s of of having you for my gue&s;t.</P>

<P>Nor do we believe that, in exerci&s;ing our ho&s;pitality, we obey this divine book. We are men before we are Mahometans. Humanity has dictated our cu&s;toms, and they are more ancient than the laws.</P>
<P>My ho&s;t, at his departure, &s;hewed him&s;elf faithful to his principles; it was impo&s;&s;ible to make him re|ceive the pre&s;ent, with which I would gratefully have acknowledged the reception he had given me.</P>
<P>The Baron, who aims to prove that Europe was originally peopled by Tartars, and not by Goths and Vandals, as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, notices the furni|ture under this ho&s;pitable roof; which was a four-po&s;t bed&s;tead, with a te&s;ter, bed, chairs and tables; and enquired if the&s;e were Tartar-furniture.</P>

<P>I am the more a&s;toni&s;hed at that, &s;ince the Moldavians and Turks have not &s;uch furniture; and
<PB N="284" REF="288">
I &s;carce can conceive by what route the&s;e European cu&s;toms have arrived here. Why have you not adopted, as well as your brethren of the Crimea, the furniture of the Turks?</P>

<P>You may &s;ee &s;ome cu&s;toms here, un|known to our ance&s;tors; but depravity cannot make the &s;ame progre&s;s in the&s;e parts, as in the Crimea; where our &s;ultans &s;et the example of Turki&s;h effe|minancy, to which they have been accu&s;tomed in the capital of the empire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baron.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perfectly feel this di&s;tinction; but it throws no light on the origin of the European furni|ture I &s;ee here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet nothing can better mark that origin. This family-furniture cannot be European; we are the root of the tree; it is your furniture which is Tartarian.</P>
</SP>
<P>This an&s;wer &s;erved but to excite my curio&s;ity, and multiply my que&s;tions; and I had the plea&s;ure to hear my ho&s;t repeat, all I had my&s;elf conjectured on this &s;ubject. He informed me al&s;o, that the Tartars near the Ca&s;pian Sea, and tho&s;e beyond it, pre&s;erve the &s;ame cu&s;toms.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="289">The form of the Tartar-beds above cited, as well as the throne of the Grand Signior, which always repre&s;ents a four-po&s;t bed&s;tead, have a &s;imilarity, which may appear intere&s;ting. If we con&s;ider that the fir&s;t governments were nece&s;&s;arily paternal; and that the Tartars afford, in this, as well as in many other mat|ters, the mo&s;t ancient annals, we &s;hall not be a&s;to|ni&s;hed that the form of the bed, on which their elders ought naturally to give judgment, has been adopted as a model for the throne of the ea&s;t. If we add to this remark, the inva&s;ion of all Europe, by people originally Tartars, we &s;hall find an explanation of the term, Bed of Ju&s;tice; always employed in France, when the power of &s;overeign maje&s;ty is fully exerted.</P>
<P><HI>Pey&s;onnel,</HI> in reply to the&s;e conjectures, &s;ays, that the Goths, who&s;e emigrants followed tho&s;e of the Vandals, were like the&s;e latter, Celtic and Teutonic nations, and had neither the &s;ame origin, nor came from the &s;ame countries as the Tartars; and yet the Tartars, known by the name of Huns, did not over-run the we&s;tern part of the continent, till long after the Goths, and even the Sclavi. The language of the Vandals and Goths, was the Celtic or Teutonic, the mother of the German; that of the Sclavi, whom we mu&s;t not confound with the Vandals, is the mother of the Sclavonian, Ru&s;&s;ian, and Poli&s;h; and and the Tartar language, from which the Turki&s;h is
<PB N="286" REF="290">
derived, has not the lea&s;t &s;imilitude, or analogy, with the two others. The Goths came from the North, and originally inhabited tho&s;e countries, which lie between the Northern Ocean, and the Baltic Sea. The Huns, under which general name are comprized all the Tartar tribes, who have extended them&s;elves towards the We&s;t, came from the Ea&s;t; and from that flat high land, which extends to the North; and the chain of the mountains Cauca&s;us and Tibet, continued almo&s;t as far as the penin&s;ula of Corea.</P>
<P>The following particulars relative to their archi|tecture, may, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> be of &s;ome utility to tho&s;e who are intere&s;ted in rural economy, though not to the di&s;ciples of <HI>Vitruvius;</HI> we beg leave to add, if &s;ufficiently intelligible.</P>
<P>Pillars placed on the points which determine the angles and openings, kept in a perpendicular po&s;ition by a beam, on which uprights are fixed, form the fir&s;t plan, and are di&s;po&s;ed &s;o as to receive and &s;up|port the roof. This accompli&s;hed, other perpendicular pillars, but &s;maller, at twelve-inch intervals, are erected, round which hazel twigs are twi&s;ted in the manner of ba&s;ket-work. This kind of wicker-work they fill with mud, mixed with cut &s;traw, which they plai&s;ter with hair-mortar, within and without, and the whole white-wa&s;hed and painted on the pillars, ba&s;es,
<PB N="287" REF="291">
doors and windows, gives the building an agreeable a&s;pect.</P>
<P>This manner of erecting is infinitely more &s;olid than it appears to be in de&s;cription; and is certainly more healthy, than the mode of building among our pea&s;ants, in the remote parts of the country. I am likewi&s;e convinced that landholders who wi&s;h, either from intere&s;t, or motives of benevolence, to build cottages, in hopes of favouring population, would be every way gainers, by adopting this new method of con&s;truction. The expence is &s;mall, and they would thus give each cottager, the means of ea&s;ily repair|ing his own habitation.</P>
<P>The &s;imple and ea&s;y mechani&s;m of their tents like|wi&s;e de&s;erves to be de&s;cribed. The Tartars habitually encamped, ought con&s;equently to have brought the art of making them to perfection. The whole force of their faculties is employed on this the fir&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ities, to a nation which has never known the luxu|ries of indolence, and which has therefore bent all its powers towards tho&s;e things, in which the exerci&s;e of the body, the chace, and the implements of war are concerned.</P>
<P>A light paling, which can ea&s;ily be packed and un|packed, forms a little circular wall of four feet and an
<PB N="288" REF="292">
half high. Its two extremities, kept near three quar|ters of a yard di&s;tant, make the entrance into the tent. A &s;core of &s;mall rods, which join at the upper ends, and, at the lower, have a leathern ring, by which they hook to the paling, form the dome, and &s;upport the roof; which con&s;i&s;ts of a cowl, or co|vering of felt, that de&s;cends, and &s;preads over the walls, which are lined al&s;o with the &s;ame &s;tuff. A girdle includes the whole, and &s;ome earth, or &s;now, thrown up round the bottom of the tent&punc; prevents the air from penetrating, and makes it perfectly &s;olid, without po&s;t or cordage. Others of a nicer con|&s;truction, have the cones circularly open at top, which apertures give pa&s;&s;age to the &s;moke, permit fires to be lighted in the tents, and render them in|acce&s;&s;ible to the intemperance of the mo&s;t rigorous climates.</P>
<P>The tent of the Cham was of this kind, but &s;o large that more than &s;ixty people might commodi|ou&s;ly &s;it round a wood fire. It was lined with crim|&s;on &s;tuff, furni&s;hed with &s;ome cu&s;hions, and had a circular carpet.</P>
<P>The be&s;t education of the Tartars goes not beyond reading and writing, but though the education of the Mirzas, or Tartarian nobility, is neglected, they are eminent for their ea&s;y politene&s;s. This is the effect
<PB N="289" REF="293">
of their familiar habits of living with their princes, without ever failing to pay them a proper re&s;pect.</P>
<P>There is no country where crimes are le&s;s com|mon than in Tartary; their plains, where malefactors might ea&s;ily e&s;cape, yield but few temptations; and the penin&s;ula of the Crimea, which affords more ob|jects to rapidity, is daily &s;hut up, and leaves not the culprit the &s;malle&s;t hope to e&s;cape puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Having already &s;aid a great deal of the different tribes of Tartars, when &s;peaking of Siberia, &amp;c. we will pa&s;s on to other matters.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XX.</HI> Moldavia.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been already ob&s;erved, that Moldavia is &s;ometimes comprehended under the name of Wal|lachia, con&s;idered in which light, that part of it lying on this &s;ide the mountain, is called Wallachia. This country takes the name of Moldavia from the rivulet
<PB N="290" REF="294">
Moldau, which runs from the upper parts into the country, mingling it&s;elf with the river Sereth. Its length extends from we&s;t to ea&s;t; that is, from the river Sereth, to the Dnei&s;ter, between thirty and forty Hungarian miles; and the breadth is about &s;eventy.</P>
<P>Its principal rivers are the Sereth, the Pruth, and the Dnei&s;ter, which form the boundary towards the ea&s;t and north. All the&s;e three rivers receive &s;e|veral &s;maller &s;treams in their cour&s;e, and the fir&s;t two fall into the Danube, which is the boundary to the &s;outh; but the latter di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Black Sea.</P>
<P>The &s;oil we traver&s;ed, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> in his de|&s;cription of this province, drew all my attention; new land&s;capes, equally intere&s;ting by a rich cultiva|tion, and a va&s;t variety of objects, pre&s;ented them|&s;elves at every &s;tep, and I &s;hould have compared Moldavia to the province of Burgundy, if this Gre|cian principality had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the advantages which re&s;ult from a moderate government.</P>
<P>But, alas! the condition of Moldavia is not better than that of Wallachia. It is governed by a Greek, who procures the appointment by the &s;ame means; and having the &s;ame intere&s;ted views, the con&s;equence
<PB N="291" REF="295">
is clear, that he mu&s;t make the &s;ubject &s;uffer equal oppre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The &s;ums paid to obtain the government, and for the inve&s;titure, cannot be a&s;certained; it depends more or le&s;s on the number and character of the can|didates, and upon the hone&s;ty of the members of the divan. If the&s;e two provinces were governed as they &s;hould be, they would be well peopled, and very rich, no &s;oil being more fertile; for, at pre&s;ent, though the ground is almo&s;t uncultivated, yet it yields even in tho&s;e years not the mo&s;t plentiful, an hundred for one in wheat, and all other &s;orts of grain. There are very commodious rivers for ren|dering commerce ea&s;y; their lands produce various articles to carry it on to advantage; &s;uch as wine, wool, leather, honey, wax, and large and &s;mall cattle. But the rivers are no longer navigated; the country wants inhabitants, tho&s;e in ea&s;y circum|&s;tances have not courage to cultivate the earth, be|cau&s;e they would only labour for others. We &s;ee tracts of land, the be&s;t and mo&s;t fertile perhaps in Europe, of ten leagues in extent, entirely uncul|tivated.</P>
<P>Long ruled by their princes, according to the faith of treaties, the&s;e people ought &s;till to have been free from the effects of de&s;poti&s;m; and &s;o they might,
<PB N="292" REF="296">
had not their princes been removable at the plea&s;ure of the Ottoman Porte. Liable at fir&s;t only to a very &s;mall tribute, Moldavia, as well as Wallachia, at that time, enjoyed a &s;hare of liberty. In the per&s;ons of their princes, they beheld, if not men of merit, at lea&s;t men of illu&s;trious families, whom the conqueror re&s;pected. But all was pre&s;ently confounded; the &s;ubjected Greeks beheld them&s;elves &s;laves, and emu|lation and di&s;tinction were lo&s;t among them. The trader was elevated to a principality; every factious pretender put in his claim; and the&s;e unhappy pro|vinces, frequently &s;et up to &s;ale, pre&s;ently groaned beneath the mo&s;t cruel vexations.</P>
<P>The town of Ya&s;&s;i, the capital of this province, &s;ituated in a boggy &s;oil, is &s;urrounded by hills, which every where pre&s;ent rural pro&s;pects, and on which might be built the mo&s;t agreeable country hou&s;es; in&s;tead of which, a few cattle are &s;cattered over them; and, if we except the hou&s;es of the <HI>Boyards,</HI> or great landholders, and tho&s;e of the Greeks, who come from Con&s;tantinople, in the &s;uite of the prince, all the other habitations of the capital be&s;peak the utmo&s;t mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The <HI>Boyards</HI> repre&s;ent, with great arrogance, the grandees of the country, though in reality they are only rich proprietors of lands, and cruel tax-gatherers.
<PB N="293" REF="297">
Seldom do they live in amity with their prince, but generally are intriguing again&s;t him, and Con&s;tan|tinople is the centre of their factions. Hither doth each party carry his complaints and his money, and the Sultan Sera&s;kier, of Be&s;&s;arabia, affords a ready refuge to tho&s;e Boyards, whom the Porte thinks proper to &s;acrifice to its tranquillity. The Tartar prince gives &s;afety to the Boyard, and under his pro|tection he is often re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; but for this pro|tection he mu&s;t pay.</P>
<P>The&s;e various expences which the Boyards reim|bur&s;e them&s;elves by oppre&s;&s;ing individuals, added to the taxes which the prince impo&s;es to pay his annual tribute, over-burden Moldavia &s;o much, that rich as is its &s;oil, it is &s;carcely &s;ufficient. This province, as well as Wallachia, when they &s;ubmitted to <HI>Ma|homet</HI> II. on condition of both being governed by Grecian princes, and only &s;ubjected to a moderate taxation, did not make &s;o good a bargain as the au|thors of the treaty imagined. It was not fore&s;een, that the vanity of the Greeks would put the govern|ment up to auction; they were equally blind to the fatal con&s;equences of that clau&s;e, by which the Grand Signior re&s;erved the right of removing them at plea|&s;ure. It is evident, this power of removal cannot fail of carrying taxation to the mo&s;t grievous exce&s;s; and that univer&s;al depredation mu&s;t be the nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="294" REF="298">
con&s;equence; and thus we find that the whole art of the&s;e &s;ubaltern governments con&s;i&s;ts in &s;eizing, and employing every means which can accelerate this devouring rapacity.</P>
<P>Nothing can di&s;play the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of the in|habitants of this province more than the violence ex|erci&s;ed towards them, in order to procure provi&s;ions by the milkmanders, or conductors, who&s;e office it is to precede and prepare the way for amba&s;&s;adors and others who travel at the expence of the Porte.</P>
<P>A family in&s;tantly di&s;lodged to make room for us, (&s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> who had one of the&s;e conductors appointed to attend him through Moldavia,) two &s;heep killed, roa&s;ted, eaten, and not paid for, and blows unnece&s;&s;arily di&s;tributed, put me out of hu|mour with my conductor, who &s;et off the &s;ame even|ing to prepare the means of tran&s;porting my carriage acro&s;s the Pruth. This &s;tream &s;eparates the Pacha|lick of Kotchim from Moldavia. <HI>Ali Aga,</HI> the name of the milkmander, had on the evening before &s;wam to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore; where, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his whip, he had a&s;&s;embled three hundred of the Mol|davians, employed them the whole night in forming trunks of trees into a crazy raft, and had repa&s;&s;ed upon it to our &s;ide. My conductor, proud of having con&s;tructed &s;o great a work, invited me to re-mount
<PB N="295" REF="299">
my carriage. And how, &s;aid I, will you get it &s;afely down to the edge of the river? Or how will you af|terwards keep it on your rickety raft, &s;carcely big enough to contain it, and which mu&s;t &s;ink under its weight.&mdash;How? By the help of this, &s;aid he, &s;hew|ing me his whip, and above a hundred bony pea&s;ants, whom he had brought from the other &s;hore. Be under no apprehen&s;ions, I would make them carry the uni|ver&s;e on their &s;houlders; if the raft &s;inks, the&s;e merry fellows can &s;wim, and I will &s;u&s;tain it; &s;hould you lo&s;e &s;o much as a pin, I would hang them every one.</P>
<P>The name of God, fir&s;t pronounced, followed with a plenitude of la&s;hes, were the &s;ignals to begin. They unharne&s;&s;ed, and brought the carriage in their arms to the edge of the precipice. There I beheld them, not without &s;huddering, ready to be cru&s;hed beneath the weight of my Berlin. Arrived at the water's edge, the next thing nece&s;&s;ary was to &s;et the raft a-float, which the hundred Moldavians at length accompli&s;hed, guiding it, (&s;ome wading, &s;ome &s;wimming) with long poles to the other &s;ide, where buffaloes, ready prepared, were harne&s;&s;ed to the carriage; and in a twinkling, I &s;aw it on the &s;ummit of the oppo&s;ite cliff.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be imagined, that <HI>Ali Aga</HI> was tri|umphant, and that having been tran&s;ported with my
<PB N="296" REF="300">
&s;uite on the other &s;ide, by a &s;econd return of the raft, I did not depart without giving &s;ome five or &s;ix guineas to the workmen; but what may not be readily &s;uppo&s;ed, and what I had not fore&s;een my&s;elf, was, that my conductor, ever attentive to all my actions, and my mo&s;t trifling ge&s;tures, &s;tayed &s;ome time be|hind to reckon with the&s;e unfortunate labourers, for the &s;mall &s;alary they had received.</P>
<P>He came up to us in about an hour, and po&s;ted on to prepare our breakfa&s;t, about three leagues fur|ther, where we joined him, while he was providing food for us, by means of the &s;ame tool, with which he con&s;tructed our raft. Had he not made a too fre|quent u&s;e of this weapon, I &s;hould have liked him very much, &s;ays the Baron, I therefore undertook to correct this battering propen&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXI.</HI> Bulgaria.</HEAD>
<P>THIS province is bounded on the North by the Danube; on the Ea&s;t by the Black Sea; on the South by Mount Haemus, which &s;eparates it from Romania; and on the We&s;t by Servia. It is thus named from the Bulgarians; a branch of the Sar|matae, and was formerly called Lower My&s;ia. The Danube, which runs through this country, for the &s;pace of eighty miles, receives the I&s;ter at Axiopolis. It has another river, I&s;char, which ri&s;es in Mount Haemus, and falls into the Danube, near Nicopolis.</P>
<P>At the foot of the mountain, which divides Bul|garia from Servia, is a warm bath, where the water gu&s;hes out in a &s;tream, about the &s;ize of a man's body; and but &s;ixty paces from it, in the &s;ame valley, is a &s;pring as cold as ice; the &s;mell however, mani|fe&s;ts that they both contain nitrous, and &s;ulphureous particles. On this mountain is a Greek convent, for monks of the order of St. Ba&s;il. In the frontiers of Servia, between the mountains of Suha, and the river
<PB N="305" REF="309">
Ne&s;&s;ava, are &s;everal warm baths, who&s;e waters are of a &s;ulphureous quality, and i&s;&s;ue from the mountain, being deeply tinged with the red &s;ands and &s;tones which it contains. At the foot of mount Wito&s;cha, a few miles on this &s;ide Sophia, towards the borders of Romania, are al&s;o four warm baths of great repute in this country; and the mountain, exclu&s;ive of its iron mines, is covered with villages, corn-lands, meadows, and vineyards.</P>
<P>The country in general may be &s;aid to be very mountainous, but the levels and vallies are extremely rich and fruitful, producing wine and corn, even to &s;uperfluity. The mountains too are al&s;o far from barren, affording excellent pa&s;turage; in parti|cular that of <HI>&s;tara plamina,</HI> which reaches as far as Widin, being towards its &s;ummit quite bare and de|&s;olate; but in the middle and lower part extremely fertile.</P>
<P>This province, &s;ays <HI>Chi&s;hull,</HI> however decried by <HI>Ovid,</HI> and di&s;paraged by our modern geographers; for the richne&s;s of its &s;oil, variety of ri&s;ing and fall|ing ground, elegance of pro&s;pect, and a competent provi&s;ion of wood and water, is perhaps not to be paralleled by any other &s;pot in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="310">Among the natural curio&s;ities of this country, are al&s;o to be reckoned the va&s;t number of large eagles in the neighbourhood of the town of Bababagi, where the archers all over Turkey &s;upply them&s;elves with feathers for their arrows, though the&s;e feathers are in number only twelve, and tho&s;e only in the tail of this bird, each of which are commonly &s;old for a crown.</P>
<P>As an in&s;tance of the longevity of the people of this province, <HI>Chi&s;hull</HI> mentions having &s;een an old Bulgarian Chri&s;tian, named <HI>Staon,</HI> aged one hun|dred and twenty years; who told him he had all his life been &s;ubject to great and continual &s;ickne&s;s, and had three times changed his teeth; once in his in|fancy, and twice in his old age.

<P>The Great Balcan, formerly called Hoemus, is a chain of mountains, which ri&s;e to a great height, one upon another, and extending them&s;elves fir&s;t from ea&s;t to we&s;t, take afterwards another direction from north

<P>The a&s;cents over the&s;e mountains are very &s;teep, &s;ays Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> and lie in the mid&s;t of great woods; the road, or rather track, is in as bad a con|dition as can be conceived; one high hill is no &s;ooner &s;urmounted, than you de&s;cend rapidly into a deep valley full of rocks, mud and water.</P>

<P>The dam&s;els of the pari&s;h entertained us with a dance, which though performed with no great art, or variety in the &s;teps and figure, had a certain plain|ne&s;s and &s;implicity which was very plea&s;ing. The ornaments of their dre&s;s were a &s;ort of cravat, con|&s;i&s;ting of various &s;ilver coins, and large bo&s;&s;y &s;ilver bracelets, and we were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the next morning, with corn &s;trewed in our way.</P>
<P>On the top of the hill, we proceeded for &s;ome time in a level road, through a &s;tately grove of oaks; after which the road begins to de&s;cend, and being &s;hortened by the plea&s;ure of the &s;hady &s;cene on each &s;ide, leads unexpectedly into the adjoining plain. In this we travel about an hour, near the foot of the

delightful Hoemus, and then find our quarters ready to receive us at a Chri&s;tian village called Tragoe. And indeed all the villages we had hitherto pa&s;&s;ed from Adrianople, were entirely inhabited by Chri&s;|tians; who, by nation are Bulgarians, but by their faith, of the Greek communion.</P>
<P>Near this village is E&s;ki Stambol, a name given by the Turks to the remains of an ancient city (po&s;&s;ibly the <HI>Oe&s;cus Triballorum)</HI> which, at the foot of Hoemus, &s;hews the entire tract of two walls; the inward one &s;quare, and about a mile in circumference; the out|ward, almo&s;t circular, and containing the compa&s;s of five miles. But be&s;ides the&s;e it has no reliques of carved work, or any in&s;cription that may give light to the true name or hi&s;tory of the place. In one corner only, of the inward wall, are &s;everal cro&s;&s;es, and an image of the Virgin mother, barbarou&s;ly cut with two or three rude lines of modern Greek cha|racters. By the above-mentioned walls runs a &s;mall river from the Hoemus, now called by the Italians, Monte Argentato, and by the Turks, Batkan.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be remarked, that the above author was then in the &s;uite of our amba&s;&s;ador, which may ac|count for his &s;uperior accommodations to tho&s;e of a private individual. I was informed, &s;ays Lord <HI>Bal|timore,</HI> we &s;hould have a view of the Adriatic and
<PB N="310" REF="314">
Black Seas, at once, from the &s;ummit of the Great Balcan, but I &s;uppo&s;e, we did not mount &s;ufficiently high; though I was often &s;truck with the immen&s;ity of &s;pace and pro&s;pect around us.</P>
<P>We &s;uffered a deal of fatigue, adds his Lord&s;hip, in pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e mountains, and were very near lo&s;ing all our baggage; which, together with our&s;elves, was often pre&s;erved by the &s;trength and care of our attendants.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed one river more than &s;ixty times, which meandered through the woods between &s;tones and &s;tumps of trees, rendering the pa&s;&s;age very danger|ous and rugged. The&s;e woods are very dangerous to pa&s;s, &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, even as far down as the banks of the Danube, being full of thieves and &s;traggling parties of libertine Crim Tartars, who are very civil and friendly to &s;trangers in their own country; but abroad, are the greate&s;t villains and thieves imaginable. So much are they &s;o, that a very little while before we pa&s;&s;ed through Moldavia, they had plundered great part of it, carrying away men, women, children, cattle, and whatever el&s;e they could lay their hands on; and this they do, notwith|&s;tanding their &s;trict alliance with the Grand Signior, who does not think it prudent to attempt to cha&s;ti&s;e
<PB N="311" REF="315">
them; but partly by threats, and partly by pre&s;ents, per&s;uades them to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The journey we have made hither, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> from Belgrade, to Adrianople, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be pa&s;&s;ed by any per&s;on not in a public character. The de&s;ert woods of Servia, and the inacce&s;&s;ible parts of Mount Hoemus, are the common refuge of thieves, who rob fifty in a company, &s;o that we had need of all our guards to &s;ecure us; and the villages are &s;o poor, that only force could extort from them nece&s;|&s;ary provi&s;ions. Indeed, the Jani&s;&s;aries had no mercy on their poverty, killing all the poultry and &s;heep they could find, without a&s;king to whom they be|longed; whil&s;t the wretched owners dur&s;t not put in their claim, for fear of being beaten. This is literally and exactly true, however extravagant it may &s;eem; and &s;uch is the natural corruption of a military go|vernment, their religion not allowing of this barba|rity any more than ours.</P>
<P>In that part of Mount Hoemus, or the Great Bal|can, which borders on Romania, there are but two pa&s;&s;ages; one of which it is &s;aid was made by the Em|peror <HI>Trajan,</HI> and capable of being defended by a &s;mall force, again&s;t a very numerous army.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="316">The Emperor <HI>Trajan</HI>'s gate &s;tands among hills, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> where the &s;teep rocks, and dreadful pre|cipices, &s;carce admit of any acce&s;s. It was erected by that emperor, in commemoration of his marching an army through this country, having made him&s;elf a road through places before impervious. It con&s;i&s;ts of two &s;tone pillars, with an arch over them, repre|&s;enting a large open gate. This building is now very ruinous, and is compo&s;ed of hewn &s;tones and bricks. The curious in &s;ubjects of antiquity, have been too bu&s;y in taking off the &s;tones, which has greatly de|faced this &s;tately monument.</P>
<P>The other pa&s;s is near a little river, called by the Bulgarians, Saltiza; this pa&s;&s;age is not &s;o &s;trait and narrow as the other, but being full of rocks and dangerous precipices, may be defended by a &s;mall force.</P>
<P>Nor are tho&s;e parts which lie on the confines of Macedonia more ea&s;y of acce&s;s; for when <HI>Per&s;eus,</HI> the la&s;t king of Macedonia, had fortified tho&s;e pa&s;&s;es again&s;t the Romans, it was believed, &s;ays <HI>Florus,</HI> there was no pa&s;&s;age left for the enemy, unle&s;s they fell immediately from heaven. What renders the pa&s;&s;age of the&s;e mountains &s;till more difficult for an army, is the exce&s;&s;ive cold felt on their &s;ummits, and which has been the de&s;truction of many thou&s;ands,

few con&s;titutions being able to pa&s;s &s;uddenly from extreme heat to that of cold, without being incom|moded.</P>
<P>The towns of mo&s;t note in this province is Sophia, one of the mo&s;t beautiful towns in the Turki&s;h em|pire, and the capital of the province. It is al&s;o fa|mous for its hot baths, that are re&s;orted to both for plea&s;ure and health. Each hou&s;e has a garden, well planted with trees and &s;hrubs. The river I&s;cha, in &s;ome places, takes its cour&s;e through the town, and in others winds along the environs. It is the re&s;i|dence of a Beglier-bey, and was built by the Emperor <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> out of the ruins of Sardica, which was its ancient name. The more modern one of Sophia it is &s;uppo&s;ed to derive from the empre&s;s <HI>Sophia,</HI> wife of <HI>Ju&s;tinian.</HI> This town, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> is &s;ituated in a large beautiful plain, on the river I&s;cha, and &s;ur|rounded with di&s;tant mountains, which affords &s;uch a fine <HI>coup d'oeil,</HI> that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee a more agreeable land&s;kip. The city it&s;elf is very large, and extremely populous.</P>
<P>Sili&s;tria is likewi&s;e a town frequently mentioned in hi&s;tory, a large and well fortified town on the Da|nube. At no great di&s;tance are the remains of the wall erected by the Greek emperors, again&s;t the in|cur&s;ions of the barbarians. Very few of the inhabi|tants
<PB N="314" REF="318">
of this place are Turks. Its great antiquity is evident from the walls, which have all the appearance of Roman, and not Turki&s;h architecture.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the plains in this di&s;trict, who derive their de&s;cent from Tartarian emigrants, are noted for their &s;ingular ho&s;pitality; which is &s;o great, that when a traveller, of any religion or country what|ever, pa&s;&s;es through any of their villages, all their hou&s;e-keepers of both &s;exes come out to &s;alute him; entreating him in the mo&s;t obliging manner to take up his lodgings with them, and kindly accept of what God has been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on them. The per|&s;on who&s;e invitation the traveller accepts, entertains him and his hor&s;es, if they do not exceed three, for the &s;pace of three days; and that too with a cor|diality and chearfulne&s;s, which can &s;carce be paralleled.</P>
<P>On the confines of the&s;e plains, and on the borders of the Black Sea lies Varna, the place where it is &s;aid <HI>Ovid</HI> was &s;ent into bani&s;hment; but the chief part of his time was pa&s;&s;ed at Tomi, in this province, to the we&s;t of Varna. The borders of a lake, where he often walked, have become famous, &s;ays Lady <HI>C.</HI> and the gentlene&s;s of his manners, and the &s;weet tone of his voice, have been recorded down to the pre&s;ent inhabitants. He repre&s;ents the inhabitants as

covered with the &s;kins of bea&s;ts, and characteri&s;es them by the breeches they then wore, <HI>braecataque turba Getarum.</HI> He de&s;cribes Tomi as a town for|tified with walls, where he was obliged to keep clo&s;e, for fear of the barbarians, who u&s;ed to take advan|tage of the Danube being frozen over, to plunder the oppo&s;ite &s;hore.</P>
<P>Varna lies about two days &s;ail from Con&s;tantinople, with a fair wind. By this route Lady <HI>Craven</HI> re|turned to Vienna, pa&s;&s;ing through Wallachia and Tran&s;ylvania. The mountains we have already de|&s;cribed, over which &s;he mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have pa&s;&s;ed, being then infected with &s;uch a large body of robbers, that a whole regiment of &s;oldiers would &s;carce have been a &s;ufficient e&s;cort.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this province, according to Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> are of the race of Scythian Tartars, who &s;peak a dialect of the Sclavonian language. They came originally from the oriental Scythians, who in|habit the banks on the other &s;ide the river Wolga, to the north of the Ca&s;pian Sea. They are Chri&s;|tians, and are &s;aid to have adopted that religion from the di&s;cour&s;es and miracles of certain bi&s;hops, whom the&s;e barbarians in their incur&s;ions into the Roman empire, had taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="320">The habitations of the pea&s;ants are of a conic form, in the &s;hape of &s;ugar-loaves, white-wa&s;hed within &s;ide, but having neither chimnies, windows, nor fur|niture in them.</P>
<P>This province, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> is divided into four &s;angiak&s;hips, or governments of officers, next in rank to a ba&s;haw of two tails. The Beglier-bey, who has under him twenty-four of the&s;e &s;angiaks, in this and the adjoining provinces, re&s;ides at Sophia.</P>

the many high mountains in this country, is that chain of the Scardi, which traver&s;es the northern part of it. Pangaeus was formerly noted for very rich &s;ilver and gold mines.

Mount Athos is one of the mo&s;t cele|brated mountains in the whole world, and &s;hall be particularly de&s;cribed in the &s;equel.

<P>Macedonia having been formerly inhabited by &s;e|veral nations, had a great number of towns. The
<PB N="318" REF="322">
mo&s;t remarkable places in it now are Salonica, an|ciently The&s;&s;alonica, &s;ituated at the bottom of a bay in the Aegean &s;ea, to which it gives its name, be|tween two and three hundred miles we&s;t of Con&s;tan|tinople; and Mount Athos, commonly called Monte Santo, on which are twenty-two convents, be&s;ides a large town well fortified, the re&s;idence of the ba&s;haw.</P>
<P>Mount Athos lies on a penin&s;ula, running out into the Aegean &s;ea, and is, indeed a chain of mountains, extending the whole length of the penin&s;ula, being &s;even Turki&s;h miles long, and three in breadth; but it is only one &s;ingle mountain, that is properly called Athos. Its uncommon heighth appears from the ac|count of <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Pliny;</HI> who affirm, that when the &s;un is at the &s;ummer &s;ol&s;tice, probably a little before its &s;itting; the mountain ca&s;ts its &s;hadow as far as the market-place of Myrrhina, in the i&s;land of Lemnos, which in the be&s;t maps is fifty-five Italian miles di&s;tant; whence the height of Mount Athos may be inferred to be about eleven &s;tadia. On it are twenty-four convents of Caloyers, or Greek monks, of the order of St. <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> be&s;ides a great number of cells or grottos, with the habitations of no le&s;s than &s;ix thou&s;and monks and hermits; though the proper hermits, who live in grottos, are not above twenty; the other monks are Anchorites, or &s;uch as live in cells: It is evident from <HI>Aelian,</HI> that
<PB N="319" REF="323">
anciently the mountain in general, and particularly the &s;ummit, was accounted very healthy, and con|ducive to long-life; whence the inhabitants were called <HI>Macrobii,</HI> or long-lived. We are further in|formed by <HI>Philo&s;tratus,</HI> in the life of <HI>Apollonius,</HI> that numbers of philo&s;ophers u&s;ed to retire to this moun|tain, for the better contemplation of the heavens, and of nature; and after their example it unque&s;tion|ably was that the monks built their cells. The&s;e monks, who are called inhabitants of the holy moun|tain, are &s;o far from being a &s;lothful &s;et of people, that, be&s;ides their daily offices of religion, they per|form all manner of work, cultivate the olive and vineyards; are carpenters, ma&s;ons, &s;tone-cutters, cloth-workers, taylors, &amp;c. They live al&s;o a very au&s;tere life, their u&s;ual food, in&s;tead of fle&s;h, being vegetables, dried olives, figs, onions, fruit, chee&s;e; and on certain days, Lent excepted, fi&s;h. Their fa&s;ts are many, and &s;evere; which, with the healthfulne&s;s of the air, renders longevity &s;o common there, that many of them live above a hundred years. In every convent are two or three &s;tudying monks, exempted from manual labour, but who u&s;e exemplary dili|gence among the many celebrated writings of anti|quity to be found in their libraries. Here it is the Greeks chiefly learn their divinity. The monks are in high e&s;teem for the orthodoxy of their doctrine, and the &s;anctity of their lives. The&s;e convents and
<PB N="320" REF="324">
churches have bells, which are rarely allowed to the Greeks; and are al&s;o environed with high and &s;trong walls planted with cannon, again&s;t any &s;urprize from cor&s;airs. Be&s;ides churches and convents, the moun|tain al&s;o has a town, called Kareis; inhabited al&s;o by monks, and the re&s;idence of the Turki&s;h com|mander, who is appointed by the Bo&s;tangi-bachi, to defend the place again&s;t the cor&s;airs. In this town a market is held every Saturday, among the monks and anchorites, which la&s;t bring hither knives, and little images, in order, by exchanging them for money, to purcha&s;e bread; but the monks, more indolent, carry them about every where, and receive alms for them. This mountain is under the protection of the Bo&s;tangi-bachi, to whom it annually pays twelve thou&s;and dollars; and a much larger &s;um is paid at Salonica, to the u&s;e of the Grand Signior. This heavy tribute is di&s;charged by alms, and the liberal contributions of Ru&s;&s;ia, and the princes of Wallachia and Moldavia. No fowls or cattle are kept upon this mountain, though on paying a certain con&s;idera|tion, graziers are allowed to fatten their cattle here.</P>
<P>Some narratives, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> have pretended they po&s;&s;e&s;s a collection of valuable manu&s;cripts; but it is much more certain they do not read them. It is equally true, that the books of the ancient The&s;&s;a|lonica, as well as tho&s;e of Con&s;tantinople, have been
<PB N="321" REF="325">
&s;ince the conque&s;t of tho&s;e places, locked up; and that the barbarians have poured melted lead into the locks, &s;o that the remains of Grecian literature, de|livered into the hands of &s;uper&s;tition and ignorance, are &s;o carefully concealed, by tho&s;e enemies of learn|ing, that we can &s;carce flatter our&s;elves we &s;hall ever be able to recover any fragments of it from their tyranny.</P>
<P>The town of Salonica is &s;ituated at the bottom of a gulph of the &s;ame name, from whence it extends to the foot of an adjoining mountain. It is defended by three old ca&s;tles towards the &s;ea, which are but in a ruinous &s;ituation, and there are two more in the upper part of the city. Its circumference may be about five or &s;ix miles, and it is &s;urrounded by a &s;trong wall. The hou&s;es are wood, painted red, and towards the top, black, where are generally in&s;cribed &s;ome ver&s;es from the alcoran, or &s;ome lines of ea&s;tern poetry, in gilt letters. Mo&s;t of them are or|namented with terraces, and the court-yards frequently contain cypre&s;&s;es, the favourite tree with the Turks, who are naturally of a melancholy ca&s;t. The &s;treets in general have wooden projections from the hou&s;es, to &s;creen pa&s;&s;engers from the heat of the &s;un, which impedes the circulation of air, and of cour&s;e makes the town le&s;s healthy.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="326">This city was anciently called Halia and Therma, but Ca&s;&s;ander having rebuilt it, called it by the name of his queen <HI>The&s;&s;alonica,</HI> who was &s;i&s;ter to <HI>Alexander the Great.</HI> To its admirable &s;ituation for trade is per|haps owing all the regard which the &s;everal con|querors of Macedonia have &s;hewn it. The advan|tages derived from it are &s;uch as are &s;carce to be met with el&s;ewhere; and as it attracted the admiration of the ancients, &s;o it has the encomium of the moderns. Nor is it di&s;tingui&s;hed only by the greatne&s;s of its traffic, but it is al&s;o very remarkable for the &s;tately remains of its ancient grandeur; &s;uch as triumphal arches, churches of an extraordinary beauty and &s;tateline&s;s, now converted into Turki&s;h mo&s;ques; particularly that of St. <HI>Demetrius,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of one church built over another, and having in it above a thou&s;and pillars of ja&s;per, porphyry, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In this and other churches are the monuments of &s;everal celebrated per&s;onages; and without the city are great numbers of antique fragments, with in&s;crip|tions. Numbers of coins are al&s;o frequently found here. It is the re&s;idence of a Turki&s;h ba&s;haw, and likewi&s;e of a Catholic and Greek archbi&s;hop, who has eight &s;uffrages under him. In the year 1313, the city was &s;old to the Venetians, who were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it about eight years after, by <HI>Amurath</HI> the &s;econd. The Chri&s;tians were &s;o very con&s;iderable formerly in

In the mo&s;que of St. <HI>Sophia</HI> is a pulpit of <HI>verd antique,</HI> from which St. <HI>Paul,</HI> according to tradition, preached to the The&s;&s;alonians. The Turks hold this monument in great veneration. At &s;ome di&s;tance from this mo&s;que, which was formerly a Greek church, may be &s;een an amphitheatre, half &s;unk into the earth, ornamented with bas-reliefs. In another part of the city is the portico of an ancient temple, though the columns and figures of it are mu|tilated; &s;ome of them are finely executed, and par|ticularly a Leda. Scarce any of the &s;treets are with|out columns and pieces of marble, with Greek in|&s;criptions, which the Turks have employed in the con&s;truction and ornamented of their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The burial places are out of the town, near the &s;ea-&s;hore. Every grave has two &s;tones, as at Con|&s;tantinople, one at the head and the other at the foot of the grave.

A little boy, who accompanied her, was extremely angered at this mark of di&s;re&s;pect, and looking at us with all the fury of a child, he put his hand to his poignard, and muttered &s;omething to us in Turki&s;h, which we could not un|der&s;tand. Not chu&s;ing however, that any other Turks &s;hould come up and explain it to us, we thought it mo&s;t advi&s;eable to turn down a different &s;treet, and decamp.</P>
<P>The &s;treet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;warm with &s;parrows, doves, crows, ravens, &s;torks, dogs and cats, which no per&s;on dares to mode&s;t, much le&s;s to kill; as the Turks
<PB N="325" REF="329">
would, in that ca&s;e, put them to death, like the Egyptians of old.</P>
<P>They reckon about eighty thou&s;and inhabitants in this city; the Jews, who have &s;everal &s;ynagogues here, make above one fourth of this number; the Greeks and the Franks another fourth part, and the Turks the remainder. If a Turk &s;tands in need of the &s;ervices of a Jew, he generally honours him with the title of pimp, cuckold, or &s;ome &s;uch plea&s;ing ap|pellation. It is true they do not mind being buffeted or ill-treated, provided they are paid for it.</P>
<P>While we remained at anchor here, &s;ays <HI>Bi&s;ani,</HI> we had Turki&s;h vi&s;itors every day to &s;ee our ve&s;&s;el; who expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves full of rapture with every thing they &s;aw, while they kept counting their beads. The petit-maitres carry about with them in Lent, chap|lets; the beads of which are made of very fine tran&s;|parent &s;tones. and fa&s;tened by a &s;ilver chain to their girdles. They have gold watches; and the hilts of their &s;abres, which they all wear, are ornamented very curiou&s;ly with embo&s;&s;ed &s;ilver. We had al&s;o &s;ome Greek pea&s;ants who came to vi&s;it us, who&s;e dre&s;s was very &s;ingular. Over a woollen robe, the ground of which was white, and worked with a va|riety of colours, they wore a kind of &s;hort ca&s;&s;ock, without &s;leeves, which covered only part of their
<PB N="326" REF="330">
neck; while the remainder was imperfectly concealed by necklaces of Turki&s;h money, intermixed with antique medals. Their hair, which was divided into ringlets, hung loo&s;ely down their &s;houlders. In this manner they formed a circular dance, placing the mu&s;ician in the middle; who, while he played, imi|tated the different &s;teps they were to perform, and &s;ung different couplets, which they repeated.</P>
<P>It is well known that idiots make their fortunes in the Mahometan countries; or at lea&s;t that they live at their ea&s;e, without being obliged to work for their livelihood. In the corner of a coffee-hou&s;e, in this city, &s;ays <HI>Bi&s;ani,</HI> we &s;aw a negro woman lying on an old matt, with &s;carce any covering on her; who was old and ugly as the very devil, though &s;he did not &s;eem to be &s;en&s;ible of it. She would &s;wallow down any thing, even &s;nuff and tobacco; which &s;hewed &s;he had entirely lo&s;t that rea&s;on which the gods are &s;aid to have given us in their anger. Yet &s;he lives free from care, and has no wants; which the piety of true believers, a name by which the Mu&s;&s;ulmen di&s;|tingui&s;h them&s;elves, have not anticipated and pro|vided for, above the&s;e ten years. I &s;aw another idiot amu&s;ing him&s;elf in the &s;treets with caning &s;ome of the Jani&s;&s;aries. This re&s;pect, which the Mahometans have for fools, is carried &s;ometimes even to adoration. Of which the following is an in&s;tance:&mdash;A Caliph of
<PB N="327" REF="331">
Bagdad, having heard there was a fool who called him&s;elf God, &s;ent for him one day to examine if he was really a fool, or an impo&s;tor. When he was come, he told him there had been a per&s;on brought to him the other day, who counterfeited the fool, and &s;aid he was a prophet &s;ent by God. I ordered him, &s;ays the Caliph, to be put in pri&s;on, and he was tried, condemned, and hanged. The fool re|plied, you acted right, and did then what it was in|cumbent on one of my faithful &s;ervants to do: this action of your's plea&s;es me much, for I had not be|&s;towed the gift of prophecy on that wretch, and he acted without any order or mi&s;&s;ion from me. On this the Caliph was ready to wor&s;hip him; for the Turks believe the&s;e people to be agitated by the &s;pirit of God. This idea of things, however, is very an|cient, and in a certain degree is found among civi|lized nations, as well as among &s;avages.</P>
<P>The nature of the Turki&s;h government is well di&s;|played at Salonica, by the oppo&s;ition which de&s;po|ti&s;m experiences from the &s;oldiery. The turbulent &s;pirit of the military, which always increa&s;es, when oppo&s;ed by feeble mea&s;ures, and &s;eizes all the au|thority of which it can deprive the &s;overeign power, has u&s;urped the government of Salonica. Many Pachas have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively been its victims; but this oppo&s;ition to de&s;poti&s;m, far from de&s;troyings its ef|fects,
<PB N="328" REF="332">
only &s;erves to increa&s;e its tyranny; and the Jani&s;&s;ary Aga, the officers who command under him, and every private Jani&s;&s;ary, are &s;o many tyrants, whom the Porte oppo&s;es with caution, the Pacha fears, and who are the terror of the whole country.</P>
<P>The practice u&s;ual with the Turks of keeping per|manent garri&s;ons, added to the want of di&s;cipline among the troops, give them in &s;ome &s;ort the pro|perty of the place at which they are &s;tationed; they there exerci&s;e rights con&s;ecrated by cu&s;tom, which they unite to maintain, though entirely oppo&s;ed to the good order of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>It is on this principle that the Galiondgis mono|polize the &s;ale of lambs at Con&s;tantinople, and force people to buy them. The Turki&s;h &s;oldiers, in every city, enjoy privileges of the &s;ame nature; and their union gives fre&s;h force to the &s;pirit of fraud, which attacks the trea&s;ury. This knavery prevails over all the coa&s;t of the Archipelago, where the exportation of corn is the principal article of clande&s;tine commerce.</P>
<P>The prohibitions of the Grand Signior, &s;o much the more &s;evere, as he is him&s;elf the monopolizer of this commodity, are of no effect; and the com|manders of the galliots, employed to prevent the ex|portation,
<PB N="329" REF="333">
are the fir&s;t to promote it, for a proper con&s;ideration paid them in advance. They then fix the &s;tation of the galliot, and that where the &s;hip &s;hall take in its illicit loading; with the time to be allowed for that purpo&s;e. The country boats bring the corn from the coa&s;ts, and Grecian and Turki&s;h ve&s;&s;els are employed in the &s;ame &s;ervice; nothing of which is noticed by the galliot; and covetou&s;ne&s;s, taking ad|vantage of negligence, gives it&s;elf up to every kind of fraud.</P>
<P>The cutting of wood upon this coa&s;t, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> is equally an object of pillage. The mo&s;t powerful individual of the country a&s;&s;umes the right of di&s;|po&s;ing of this property; and the navigator who buys fraudulently, and endeavours to better his bargain, nece&s;&s;arily encourages this &s;pirit of rapine, which an|nihilates all good order, and cau&s;es the &s;tate, which fur|ni&s;hes him with &s;ailors, to &s;uffer inconceivable lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>About thirty miles &s;outh-we&s;t of Salonica, lies Janniza, anciently Pella; which, though now an in|con&s;iderable town, was formerly the re&s;idence of the Macedonian kings, and the place which gave birth to <HI>Alexander the Great.</HI></P>
<P>Philippi, a village having but few hou&s;es, &s;tands near the ruins of the ancient celebrated town of that

name. Its inhabitants con&s;i&s;t only of a few poor Greeks; yet it is the re&s;idence of a Grecian bi&s;hop, who &s;tiles him&s;elf metropolitan of Philippi and Drama, and has &s;even bi&s;hops under him. The city of Philippi &s;tood on a hill, between the rivers Ne&s;&s;us and Strymon, on the borders of Thrace, to which in its mo&s;t ancient times it belonged. It was at fir&s;t called Crenides, or &s;pring-town, from the many &s;prings i&s;&s;uing out of the hill on which it &s;tood; af|terwards Dathos, or Tha&s;us, from the Tha&s;ii, who built it; and lately Philippi, from <HI>Philip</HI> of Mace|don; who, after having reduced it to a&s;hes, re-built it with con&s;iderable improvements; and from that time it belonged to Macedonia. Near this town was fought the memorable battle between <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;|&s;ius,</HI> on one &s;ide; and <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Anthony,</HI> on the other; in which the latter were victorious. Under <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> it was a Roman colony. At pre&s;ent it lies wa&s;te; though &s;till boa&s;ting &s;ome curious remains of antiquity, particularly the ruins of a noble amphitheatre. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> has written one of his epi&s;tles to the Chri&s;tians of this place.</P>
<P>Of all the religions exi&s;ting, &s;ays Lady <HI>M. W. M.</HI> that of the Arnounts, inhabitants of this province, &s;eems the mo&s;t &s;ingular; they are natives of Aroun|tlinch, the ancient Macedonia, and &s;till retain the courage and hardine&s;s, though they have lo&s;t the name

of Macedonians, being the be&s;t militia in the Turki&s;h empire; and the only check upon the Jani&s;&s;aries. They are foot &s;oldiers, and are all armed and cloathed at their own expence; they are dre&s;&s;ed in clean, but coar&s;e white cloth, carrying guns of a prodigious length, which they run with on their &s;houlders, as if they did not feel the weight of them; the leader &s;inging a &s;ort of rude tune, not unplea&s;ant, and the re&s;t making up the chorus. The&s;e people living be|tween Chri&s;tians and Mahometans, and not being &s;killed in controver&s;y, declare that they are utterly unable to judge which religion is be&s;t; but, to be certain of not entirely rejecting the truth, they very prudently follow both. They go to the mo&s;ques on Fridays, and to the church on Sundays; &s;aying, for their ex|cu&s;e, that at the day of judgment they are &s;ure of protection from the true prophet; but which that is, they are not able to determine in this world.

<P>ALBANIA, or <HI>Arnaut,</HI> comprehends the old Gre|cian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lyricum, and Epirus. The former was added to Macedonia by <HI>Philip;</HI> the word Epirus &s;ig|nifying the continent. It is to Epirus that Italy owed its fir&s;t apricots, whence it accordingly called them <HI>mala Epirotica.</HI> This province is bounded by Servia on the North; by Macedonia on the Ea&s;t; by Achaia on the South; and by the Ionian, and Adriatic Sea, towards the We&s;t. The inhabitants of this province make very good &s;oldiers but have &s;carce any notions of learning among them; yet they are very &s;kilful in making aqueducts; and, without any mathematical in&s;truments, will mea&s;ure di&s;tances, with all the ex|actne&s;s of a geometrician. Their method of treating hernia is al&s;o remarkable, but very rough.</P>
<P>The chief towns in this province are, 1. Scutari, called, by the Turks, I&s;codar; a large and fortified town, &s;ituated upon a lake of the &s;ame name. It lies about five and twenty miles from the gulph of Venice. This city is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the re|&s;idence
<PB N="333" REF="337">
of the ancient kings of Illyricum, and it is &s;till the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, though &s;ubject to the Turks.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ale&s;&s;io, in Latin <HI>Ly&s;&s;us,</HI> a town on the river Drin, not far from where it di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Adriatic gulph; is famous for being the &s;e|pulchre of <HI>Scandenberg,</HI> who died here about the year 1467, He re&s;i&s;ted the whole force of the Turki&s;h empire, for a great number of years, with a very incon&s;iderable army; and is &s;aid to have de|feated them, in no le&s;s than two and twenty dif|ferent engagements.</P>
<P N="3">3. Durazzo, Epidamnus, or Dyrrachium, a &s;mall port, on a penin&s;ula, having a pretty good harbour and ca&s;tle. Its fir&s;t name Epidamnus denotes the corruption of its inhabitants, who were &s;o infamous for fraud, treachery, and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s; that the Romans, when they became ma&s;ters of the town, changed its name to that of Dyrrachium, whence its pre&s;ent name is derived. This is the celebrated port, or gulph, of Venice, to which the Romans &s;ailed, who went from the South-ea&s;t parts of Italy, into Greece. It is likewi&s;e famous for having been the place of <HI>Cicero</HI>'s bani&s;hment; and affording a retreat to <HI>Pompey,</HI> when he fled from <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> at Brun|du&s;ium.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="338">The province of The&s;&s;aly, now called Janna by the Turks, derives its name from king <HI>The&s;&s;alus;</HI> but was more anciently called Oemonia, from Oemon, father of <HI>The&s;&s;alus.</HI> It is bounded by Macedonia, on the North; the Archipelago, on the Ea&s;t; by Achaia, towards the South; and by Epirus, towards the We&s;t. It was &s;ome time annexed to Macedonia, and at others divided from it. The celebrated Mount Pindus &s;e|parates it from Epirus, or a part of pre&s;ent Albania. Among its once celebrated twenty-four mountains, the mo&s;t celebrated is Olympus; which, for its un|common height, is celebrated by the ancient poets, and made the re&s;idence of the gods. The poets have feigned that it reached up to heaven, and yet it is not above an Engli&s;h mile in height. Pelion and O&s;&s;a are likewi&s;e among the number of mountains in this province. Here al&s;o are &s;ituated, the plains of Phar|&s;alia; and between the mountains Olympus, Pelion and O&s;&s;a, is the delightful valley of Tempe; which was &s;o adorned with the gifts of nature, and &s;o de|lightfully watered, by the gently winding &s;treams of the Peneus, now the Salampria, that it was reckoned the garden of the mu&s;es. This country is certainly fertile to exuberance, and &s;eems to exceed all other parts of Greece. It produces oranges, citrons, le|mons, pomegranates, grapes of an uncommon &s;weet|ne&s;s, excellent figs and melons, almonds, olives, cot|ton, &amp;c. and che&s;nuts take their Latin name from
<PB N="335" REF="339">
the town of Ca&s;tanea, in Magne&s;ia; whence they were fir&s;t brought into the colder climates of Europe. It was noted anciently for its breed of cattle and hor&s;es; from which, and the extraordinary &s;kill of the The&s;&s;alians, in hor&s;eman&s;hip, in all probability, the fable of the Centaurs, who are &s;aid to have been half men, and half hor&s;es, took its ri&s;e. The modern The&s;&s;alonians are a well-made people. The mo&s;t re|markable places in this province are,</P>
<P>Lari&s;&s;a, by the Turks named Geni&s;akar; the ca|pital, &s;ituated near Mount Olympus, on the river Pe|neus, and in a hilly, and very delightful part of The&s;&s;aly. It is a good trading city, and the &s;ee of a Greek bi&s;hop. Here the celebrated <HI>Achilles</HI> was born.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation, &s;ay <HI>Brown,</HI> is very plea&s;ant; the city being built on a ri&s;ing ground, on the upper part of which &s;tands a palace of the Grand Signior, who kept his court here in 1669, in order to be near Candia, which was at that time the &s;eat of war; and likewi&s;e for the convenience of hawking and hunting; the country, about Lari&s;&s;a, being well adapted for tho&s;e recreations. Notwith&s;tanding the extreme height of Mount Olympus, in the imagination of the poets, it &s;eems, according to the above writer, that no &s;now was to be &s;een on its &s;ummit, in the month
<PB N="336" REF="340">
of September; whil&s;t on the Alpine, Pyrenean and Carpathian mountains, it lies all the year.</P>
<P>Far&s;a, &s;aid to be the ancient Phar&s;alus, and famous for the battle fought near this city, between <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Pompey,</HI> lies thirty miles to the South of Lari&s;&s;a; though <HI>Cluverius</HI> places the&s;e celebrated plains more to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>Janna, from whence this country takes its pre&s;ent name, is a well-built town, about forty miles to the north of Lepanto.</P>
<P>Torno&s;o, ea&s;t of the above, is a &s;pacious plea&s;ant city, in which are eighteen Greek churches, and three Turki&s;h mo&s;ques. The pre&s;ent bi&s;hop is under the archbi&s;hop of Lari&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>Armiro, or Etraria, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the port from whence the Argonauts &s;et &s;ail.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the per&s;ons, of the inhabitants of this province, <HI>Brown</HI> relates that the men are tall, and well proportioned, with black hair and eyes, and rubicond complexions; the women likewi&s;e are cele|brated for their beauty. The Macedonians, who in|habit the mountains to the northward, are much more rough and weather-beaten, in their appearance;
<PB N="337" REF="341">
whil&s;t the natives of the Morea, to the &s;outhward, have &s;warthy complexions, compared with theirs; &s;o that this province, whether we con&s;ider the &s;weetne&s;s and temperature of the air, the fertility of the &s;oil, the variety of plea&s;ing land&s;capes, or the beauty of the inhabitants, &s;eems preferable, in the&s;e re&s;pects, to every other part of Greece; and ju&s;tly to have me|rited the character the ancients gave of it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIV.</HI> Livadia</HEAD>
<P>THE province of Livadia, which compri&s;es an|cient Greece, properly &s;o called; and to which belonged the little kingdoms of Acarania, Aetolia, Locris, Phocis, Doris, Boeotia, Megara and Attica; is bounded by The&s;&s;aly on the North; by the Archi|pelago, or Aegean Sea, towards the Ea&s;t; by the Morea, or Peloponne&s;us, on the South; and by the Ionian Sea towards the We&s;t. The principal rivers in this country, which is for the mo&s;t part mountain|ous, are, the Sionapro, anciently called the Achelous, &s;eparating the Arcaranians from the Aetolians, the Ce|phi&s;us
<PB N="338" REF="342">
and the I&s;menus, which latter river di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Archipelago.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable places in this province are</P>
<P>Athens, according to <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> now called Setines. This ancient capital of Attica, is &s;ituated near the gulph of Engia, about forty miles to the Ea&s;t of the i&s;thmus of Corinth; and about the &s;ame di&s;tance from Cape Raphaei, the mo&s;t ea&s;tern part of Livadia. It &s;tands in the center of a large and beautiful plain; making up for what it may be deficient in fertility, by the healthine&s;s of its &s;ituation. This city was at fir&s;t called Cecropia, rom <HI>Cecrops,</HI> its founder; but af|terwards known by the name of Athens. Exclu&s;ive of its power, grandeur and opulence, it was highly celebrated for the incorruptible fidelity of its citi|zens; and for being the nur&s;ery of the mo&s;t eminent philo&s;ophers, &s;tate&s;men and orators: for its multitude, likewi&s;e, of great commanders, no city has ever equalled it. It was governed at fir&s;t by kings, then by archons; but afterwards fell, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, under the power of the Per&s;ians, Macedonians and Romans. In latter times it came under the dominion of the Turks, from whom it was taken by the Venetians. In the year 1455, the Turks again took it. In 1687 the Venetians recovered it. But in the la&s;t wars, be|tween the&s;e two powers, the Turks again got po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="339" REF="343">
of it. The&s;e many vici&s;&s;itudes have greatly dimini&s;hed its &s;plendor; but even in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, are many remains of its ancient grandeur, which give ocular demon&s;tration of the great, and a&s;toni&s;h|ing perfection of the Athenians, in &s;culpture and architecture. The inhabitants, at this time, are reckoned about ten thou&s;and; three-parts of whom are Chri&s;tians, and have a great number of churches, and places of wor&s;hip. The Turks al&s;o have here five mo&s;ques.</P>
<P>Among the many great, and &s;mall remains of an|cient and &s;tately edifices, tho&s;e more particularly worthy of notice, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> are, the temple of Jupiter Olympias, and, above all, the <HI>Parthenian,</HI> or magnificent temple of <HI>Minerva;</HI> now converted into a Turki&s;h mo&s;que, and accounted the fine&s;t piece of antiquity in the world. In the la&s;t Venetian war, this building &s;uffered very much by the cannon. The two rivers, Ily&s;&s;us and Eridanus, that water the plain in which Athens now &s;tands, are very &s;mall; the former being diverted into &s;everal canals for wa|tering the olive plantations, and the latter lo&s;t in the many branches through which it is conveyed over the country.</P>
<P>Athens had anciently three ports, of which Pha|lerum and Munichia lay to the ea&s;tward, and Piraeus
<PB N="340" REF="344">
to the we&s;t, of a &s;mall cape. The latter being an en|clo&s;ed &s;pacious harbour, with a narrow entrance, is &s;till much re&s;orted to; and, by the Greeks, called <HI>Porto Drago;</HI> but, by the Italians, <HI>Porto Leone,</HI> from a pillar there in memory of a lion, which was carried from hence to Venice.</P>
<P>The city was not more than two miles and a half from the &s;ea, by Phalerum, but perhaps the di&s;tance is increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Phalerum was &s;aid to have been named from <HI>Pha|lerus,</HI> a companion of <HI>Ja&s;on,</HI> in the Argonautic expe|dition. <HI>The&s;eus</HI> &s;ailed from it for Crete; and <HI>Me|ne&s;theus,</HI> his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, for Troy; and it continued to be the haven of Athens, to the time of <HI>Themi&s;tocles.</HI> It is a &s;mall port, of a circular form, the entrance narrow; the bottom of a clear fine &s;and, vi&s;ible through the tran&s;parent water. The farm of <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> and his monument, which was erected at the public expence, were by this port. Munychia is of a dif|ferent form, or oval, and more con&s;iderable; the mouth al&s;o narrow.</P>
<P>The traveller, accu&s;tomed to deep ports and bulky &s;hipping, may view Phalerum with &s;ome &s;urprize; but Argo is &s;aid to have been carried on the &s;houlders of the crew; the ve&s;&s;els, at the &s;iege of Troy, were
<PB N="341" REF="345">
drawn up on the &s;hore, as a bulwark before the camp; and the mighty fleet of <HI>Xerxes</HI> con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of light barks and gallies. Phalerum, though a ba&s;on, &s;hallow and not large, may, perhaps even now, be capable of receiving an armament, like that of <HI>Me|ne&s;theus,</HI> though it con&s;i&s;ted of fifty &s;hips.</P>
<P>The capital port was that called Piraeus. The en|trance of this is narrow, and formed by two rocky points. Within were three &s;tations for &s;hipping; Kanthanu, &s;o named from a hero; Aphrodi&s;ium, from a temple of <HI>Venus;</HI> and Zea, the re&s;ort of ve&s;&s;els laden with grain. The wall was begun by <HI>Themi&s;tocles,</HI> and completed as the importance of the place de|&s;erved. This whole fortification was of hewn &s;tone, without cement, or other materials, except lead and iron, which were u&s;ed, to hold together the exterior ranges, or facings. It was &s;o wide that loaded carts, could pa&s;s on it in different directions; and it was forty cubits high, which was half what he had de|&s;igned. The bones of this great man, when tran&s;|ported from Magne&s;ia, by the <HI>Moeander,</HI> were, with propriety, depo&s;ited in the Piraeus, near the bigge&s;t port, called Kantharus; by which were the ar&s;enals. "When you are got within the elbow, (&s;ays <HI>Pau&s;anias)</HI> which projects from the promontory of Alcimus, where the water is &s;mooth, you are near the &s;cite of

his tomb." It was in &s;hape like an altar, or round, and on a large ba&s;ement.</P>
<P>The Piraeus, as Athens flouri&s;hed, became the common emporium of Greece. <HI>Hippodamus,</HI> an architect, celebrated, be&s;ides other monuments of his genius, as the inventor of many improvements in hou&s;e-building, was employed to lay out the ground. Five porticos, which uniting, formed the long por|tico, were erected by the ports. Here was an Agora, or market-place; and, farther from the &s;ea, another called Hippodamia. By the ve&s;&s;els were dwellings for the mariners. A theatre was opened, temples were rai&s;ed, and the Piraeus, which &s;urpa&s;sed the city in utility, began to equal it in dignity. The cavities, and windings of Munychia, were filled with hou&s;es; and the whole &s;ettlement, comprehending Phalerum, and the ports of Piraeus, with the ar&s;enals, the &s;tore-hou&s;es, and the famous armoury, of which <HI>Philo</HI> was the architect, and the &s;heds for three hundred, and afterwards four hundred, triremes, re&s;emble the city of Rhodes, which had been planned by the &s;ame <HI>Hippo|damus.</HI></P>
<P>It was the de&s;ign of <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> to annex the Pi|raeus to the city, by long walls. The &s;ide de&s;cend|ing to Phalerum was begun. <HI>Pericles</HI> completed it, and erected the oppo&s;ite wall.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="347">The Piraeus was reduced, with great difficulty, by <HI>Sylla,</HI> who demoli&s;hed the walls, and &s;et fire to the ar|moury and ar&s;enals. In the &s;econd century, be&s;ides hou&s;es for triremes, the temple of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Minerva,</HI> with their images in bra&s;s, were erected; and a temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> a portico, and the tomb of <HI>Themi&s;tocles.</HI></P>
<P>The port of the Piraeus has been named Porto Leone, from the marble lion &s;een in the chart; and al&s;o Porto Draco. The lion has been de&s;cribed as a piece of admirable &s;culpture, ten feet high; and as repo&s;ing on its hinder parts. Near Athens was another lion, po&s;ture couchant, probably its compa|nion. Both the&s;e were removed to Venice, by the famous General <HI>Mori&s;ini,</HI> and are to be &s;een there before the ar&s;enal.</P>
<P>At the mouth of the port are two ruined piers. A few ve&s;&s;els, mo&s;tly &s;mall craft, frequent it. Some low land, at the head, &s;eems an encroachment on the water. The buildings are, a mean cu&s;tom hou&s;e, with a few &s;heds; and, by the &s;hore, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, a warehou&s;e belonging to the French, and a Greek mona&s;tery, dedicated to <HI>S. Spiridion.</HI></P>
<P>It was the boa&s;t of the early Athenians, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> that their origin was from the land which they inhabited; and their antiquity co-equal with the
<PB N="344" REF="348">
&s;un. The reputed founder of their city was <HI>Cecrops;</HI> who, uniting a body of the natives then living di&s;|per&s;ed and in caves, &s;ettled on the rock of the Acropolis. He was there &s;ecure from inundation; a calamity much dreaded after the deluge, which had h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned one hundred and ninety years before. The hill was nearly in the center of his little territory; ri&s;ing maje&s;tically in the middle of the plain, as if de&s;igned by nature for the &s;eat of government. The town, and its domain, was called Cecropia; but the name of the former was afterwards changed in ho|nour of <HI>Minerva.</HI> A wandering people, called Pe|la&s;gi, were fir&s;t employed to level the &s;ummit of the rock, and to encompa&s;s it with a wall, which they completed, except on the &s;outh; where the deficiency was &s;upplied by trunks of olive trees, and palli&s;adoes. The entrance was by nine gates. Afterwards <HI>Cimon,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Miltiades,</HI> erected the wall on the &s;outh &s;ide, with the &s;poil he had taken in the Per&s;ian war.</P>
<P>The tyranny of <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus</HI> was e&s;tabli&s;hed by his getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Acropolis, or citadel; from which he could command, and over-awe the town be|low. His &s;on <HI>Hippias</HI> was expelled; and then fol|lowed the inva&s;ion by <HI>Darius,</HI> and the battle of Ma|rathon. Thirty-three years after this, Athens was taken, and &s;et on fire by <HI>Xerxes;</HI> and, in the next year, by his general, <HI>Mardonius;</HI> but, on the victories
<PB N="345" REF="349">
of Plataea and Salamis, it emerged from ruin, to &s;u|perior lu&s;tre, and extended dominion. The Pelo|ponne&s;ian war then en&s;ued; the long walls were de|moli&s;hed; and it was even propo&s;ed to raze the city, and lay wa&s;te the plain.</P>
<P>The victory obtained over the Thebans, at Man|tinea, left Athens at lei&s;ure to indulge in elegant di&s;|&s;ipation. A poet was preferred to a general, and va&s;t &s;ums were expended on plays, and public &s;pectacles. At this period <HI>Philip</HI> of Macedon was a&s;piring to the empire of Greece and A&s;ia, <HI>Alexander,</HI> his &s;on, &s;a|crificed a hecatomb to <HI>Minerva,</HI> at Athens; and forti|fied the Piraeus to keep the city in &s;ubjection. On his death, the Athenians revolted, but were defeated by <HI>Antipater,</HI> who garri&s;oned Munychia. They rebelled again, but the garrigarchy were re in&s;tated. <HI>Deme|trius,</HI> the Phalerean, who was made governor, beau|tified the city, and they erected to him three hundred and &s;ixty &s;tatues; which, on his expul&s;ion, they de|moli&s;hed, except one in the Acropolis. <HI>Demetrius Poliorcetes</HI> reduced the garri&s;on, and re&s;tored demo|cracy; when they deified him, and lodged him in the back part of the Parthenon, as a gue&s;t to be enter|tained by their <HI>Minerva.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Philip,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> encamping near the city, and laying the territory wa&s;te, the Athenians were re|duced
<PB N="346" REF="350">
to &s;olicit protection from the Romans, and to receive a garri&s;on, which remained till the war with <HI>Mithridates;</HI> when the tyrant <HI>Ari&s;tion</HI> made them re|volt. <HI>Archelaus,</HI> the Athenian general, unable to with&s;tand the Roman fury, retreated into the Piraeus, and Munichia. <HI>Sylla</HI> burned both places, and de|feated the city and &s;uburbs; not &s;paring even the &s;e|pulchres.</P>
<P>This city now became dependent, more or le&s;s, on the different Roman emperors, till the time of <HI>Alaric,</HI> king of the Goths; who, under the emperors, <HI>Arca|dius</HI> and <HI>Honorius,</HI> over-ran Greece and Italy; &s;ack|ing, pillaging and de&s;troying. Then the Pelopon|ne&s;ian towns were overturned, Arcadia and Lacede|mon were laid wa&s;te; the two &s;eas, by the i&s;thmus, were burni&s;hed, with the flames of Corinth; and the Athenian matrons were dragged in chains by barba|rians. The invaluable trea&s;ures of antiquity, it is related, were removed; the &s;tately and magnificent &s;tructures converted into piles of ruins; and Athens was &s;tripped of every thing, &s;plendid or remarkable. <HI>Syne&s;ius,</HI> a writer of that age, compares the city to a victim, the body of which had been con&s;umed, and the hide only remained.</P>
<P>After this even Athens became an un-important place, and as ob&s;cure, as it had once been famous.

<P>Athens, as it were, re-emerges a little from obli|vion, in the thirteenth century; till towards the latter end of the fifteenth, by being made the &s;eat of war, between the Greek and Turki&s;h emperors, it &s;unk again. In 1464 it was taken by the Venetians.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that after this conque&s;t Athens was again, in a manner, forgotten. So lately as about the middle of the &s;ixteenth century, the city was commonly believed to have been utterly de|&s;troyed, and not to exi&s;t; except a few huts of poor fi&s;hermen. <HI>Cru&s;ius,</HI> a learned and inqui&s;itive German, procured more authentic information, from his Greek corre&s;pondents re&s;iding in Turkey, which he pub|li&s;hed in 1584; to awaken curio&s;ity, and to promote further di&s;coveries. One of the&s;e letters is from a native of Nauplia; a town near Argos, in the Morea. The writer &s;ays, he had been often at Athens, and that it &s;till contained things worthy to be &s;een; &s;ome of which he enumerates, and then &s;ubjoins, "but
<PB N="348" REF="353">
why do I dwell on this place? It is as the &s;kin of an animal which has been long dead."</P>
<P>The walls of Athens, when the city was in its pro&s;|perity with the Piraeus, were twenty-four miles in cir|cumference. In its pre&s;ent &s;tate, &s;ays the above writer, this city is certainly, by no means incon&s;ider|able, either in extent, or in number of inhabitants. It is placed, by geographers, in fifty-three degrees of longitude. its latitude was found, by Mr. <HI>Vernon,</HI> an Engli&s;h traveller, to be thirty-eight degrees, and five minutes. It enjoys a fine temperature, and a &s;erene &s;ky. The air is clear and whole&s;ome, though not &s;o delicately &s;oft, as in Ionia. The town &s;tands be|neath the Acropolis, or citadel; not encompa&s;&s;ing the rock as formerly, but &s;preading into the plain. Cor&s;airs infe&s;ting it, the avenues were &s;ecured; and in 1676, the gates were regularly &s;hut after &s;un-&s;et. It is now open again, but &s;everal of the gateways re|main, and a guard of Turks patrole at midnight.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es in this city are mo&s;tly mean and &s;trag|gling; many with large areas, or courts, before them. In the lanes, the high walls on each &s;ide, which are commonly white-wa&s;hed, &s;trongly reflect the heat of the &s;un. The &s;treets are very irregular; and anciently were neither uniform, nor hand&s;ome. They have water conveyed, in channels, from mount

Hymettus; and in the Bazar. or market-place, is a large fountain. The Turks have &s;everal mo&s;ques, and public baths. The Greeks have convents for men and women, with many churches, in which &s;er|vice is regularly performed; and, be&s;ides the&s;e, they have numerous oratories, or chapels; &s;ome in ruins, or con&s;i&s;ting of bare walls, frequented only on the anniver&s;aries of the &s;aints, to whom they are dedi|cated. A portrait of the owner, on a board, is placed in them on that occa&s;ion, and removed when the &s;olemnity of the day is over.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the more &s;table antiquities, of which we &s;hall give an account in the &s;equel, many detached pieces are found in the town, by the fountains; in the &s;treets, the walls, the hou&s;es and churches. Among the&s;e are fragments of &s;culpture; a marble chair or two, which, probably, belonged to the Gymna&s;ia, or theatres; a &s;un-dial at the catholicon or cathedral, in&s;cribed with the name of the maker; and, at the archiepi&s;copal hou&s;e, clo&s;e by, a very curious ve&s;&s;el of marble, u&s;ed as a ci&s;tern to receive water; but once &s;erving, it is likely, as a public &s;tandard, or mea&s;ure. Many columns occur, with &s;ome maimed &s;tatues and pede&s;tals; &s;everal with in&s;criptions, and almo&s;t buried in earth. A cu&s;tom has prevailed, as at Chios, of fixing in the wall, over the gateways and doors of the hou&s;es, carved &s;tones; mo&s;t of which
<PB N="350" REF="355">
exhibit the funereal &s;upper. In the courts of the hou&s;es lie many round pillars, once placed on the graves of the Athenians; and a great number are &s;till to be &s;een, applied to the &s;ame u&s;e, in the Turki&s;h burying grounds, before the Acropolis. The&s;e ge|nerally have conci&s;e in&s;criptions, containing the name of the per&s;on, and of the town and tribe, to which the decea&s;ed belonged. <HI>Demetrius,</HI> the Phalerean, who en|deavoured to re&s;train &s;epulchral luxury, enacted, that no per&s;on &s;hould have more than one; and that the height &s;hould not exceed three cubits. Another &s;pe|cies, which re&s;embles our modern head-&s;tones, is &s;ometimes adorned with &s;culpture; and has an epitaph in ver&s;e. We &s;aw a few mutilated Hermae. There were bu&s;ts on long quadrangular ba&s;es, the heads frequently of bra&s;s, invented by the Athenians. At fir&s;t they were made to repre&s;ent only <HI>Hermes,</HI> or <HI>Mer|cury,</HI> and de&s;igned as guardians of the &s;epulchres, in which they were lodged; but afterwards the hou&s;es, &s;treets and porticos of Athens, were adorned with them, and rendered venerable, by a multitude of portraits of illu&s;trious men and women, of heroes, and of gods; and it is related, <HI>Hipparchus,</HI> son of <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus,</HI> erected them in &s;maller towns, and by the road-&s;ide; in&s;cribed with moral apothegms, in elegiac ver&s;e; thus making them vehicles of in&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="356">The Acropolis, or citadel, which was the city of Cecrops, is &s;till a fortre&s;s, with a thick irregular wall, &s;tanding on the brink of precipices; and enclo&s;ing a large area, about twice as long as broad. Some por|tions of the ancient wall may be di&s;covered, on the out&s;ide, particularly at the two extreme angles; and, in many places, it is patched with pieces of columns, and with marbles taken from the ruins. The garri|&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of a few Turks, who re&s;ide there with their families, and are called by the Greeks, <HI>Ca&s;triani,</HI> or &s;oldiers of the ca&s;tle.

Their hou&s;es overlook the city, plain, and gulph; but the &s;ituation is as airy as plea&s;ant; though attended with &s;o many inconveniences, that tho&s;e who are able, and have the option, prefer living below, when not on duty. The rock is lofty, abrupt and in|acce&s;&s;ible, except the front, which is towards Piraeus; and, on that quarter, is a mountainous ridge, within cannon-&s;hot. It is de&s;titute of water fit for drinking, and &s;upplies are daily carried up in earthen jars, on hor&s;es and a&s;&s;es, from one of the conduits in the town.</P>
<P>The Acropolis furni&s;hed a very ample field to the ancient virtuo&s;i. It was filled with monuments of Athenian glory, and exhibited an amazing di&s;play of beauty, opulence and art; each contending, as it
<PB N="352" REF="357">
were, for the &s;uperiority. It appeared as one entire offering to the deity; &s;urpa&s;&s;ing in excellence, and a&s;toni&s;hing in magnificence. <HI>Heliodorus,</HI> named <HI>Pe|riegetes,</HI> the guide, had employed on it fifteen books. The curio&s;ities of various kinds, with the pictures, &s;tatues, and pieces of &s;culpture, were &s;o many, and &s;o remarkable, as to &s;upply <HI>Polemo Periegetes</HI> with matter for four volumes; and <HI>Strabo</HI> affirms, that as many would be required in treating of other portions of Athens and Attica. In particular, the number of &s;tatues was prodigious. <HI>Tiberius Nero,</HI> who was fond of images, plundered the Acropolis, as well as Del|phi and Olympia; yet Athens, and each of the&s;e places, had not fewer remaining in the time of <HI>Pliny.</HI> Even <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;eems here to be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the multiplicity of his &s;ubject. But this banquet, as it were, of the under&s;tanding, has long &s;ince been with|drawn; and is now become like the tale of a vi&s;ion. The &s;pectator views with concern, the marble ruins, intermixed with mean, flat-roofed cottages, and extant amid rubbi&s;h; the &s;ad memorials of a nobler people; which, however, as vi&s;ible from the &s;ea&punc; &s;hould have introduced modern Athens to more early notice. They who reported it was only a &s;mall village, mu&s;t have beheld the Acropolis through the wrong end of their tele&s;copes.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="358">When we con&s;ider the long &s;eries of years which has elap&s;ed, and the variety of fortune which Athens has undergone, we may wonder that any portions of the old city has e&s;caped; and that the &s;cite &s;till fur|ni&s;hes an ample fund of curious entertainment.</P>
<P><HI>Atticus</HI> is repre&s;ented by <HI>Cicero,</HI> as receiving more plea&s;ure, from the recollection of the eminent men it had produced, than from the &s;tately edifices, and works of art, with which it then abounded.</P>
<P>It was the fortune of Athens, whil&s;t flouri&s;hing in glory, dominions and revenue, to produce <HI>Pericles,</HI> a man as di&s;tingui&s;hed by the va&s;tne&s;s of his ideas, as by the correctne&s;s of his ta&s;te; and as eloquent as &s;plendid. His enemies declaiming again&s;t his temples and images, and comparing the city, with its gilding and painting, to a vain woman hung with jewels, he took occa&s;ion to &s;hew, it was wi&s;dom to convert the pro&s;perity of a &s;tate, &s;ufficiently prepared for war, into a perpetual ornament, by public works, which ex|cited every liberal art, moved every hand, and di&s;|pen&s;ed plenty to the labourer and artificer, to the mariner and merchant; the whole city being at once employed, maintained and beautified by it&s;elf. "Think ye, &s;aid he, it is much I have expended? Some an|&s;wered, very much. Be mine then, he replied, the
<PB N="354" REF="359">
whole burthen, and mine the honour, of in&s;cribing the edifices rai&s;ed for you."</P>
<P>The architects, employed by <HI>Pericles,</HI> were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;ummate &s;kill in their profe&s;&s;ion; and <HI>Phidias</HI> was his over&s;eer. The artificers, in the va|rious branches, were emulous to excel the materials, by their workman&s;hip. To grandeur of proportion, were added inimitable form and grace. The vigour of one admini&s;tration accompli&s;hed, what appeared to require, the united efforts of many; yet each fabric was as mature in perfection, as if it had been long fini&s;hing. <HI>Plutarch</HI> affirms, that in his time, the &s;truc|tures of <HI>Pericles</HI> alone, demon&s;trated the relations of the ancient power and wealth of Greece, not to be romantic. In their character was an excellence, pe|culiar and unparalleled. Even then they retained all their original beauty. A certain frankne&s;s bloomed upon them, and pre&s;erved their fame un-injured; as if they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a never-fading &s;pirit, and had a &s;oul invincible by age. The remains of &s;ome of the&s;e edifices, &s;till extant in the Acropolis, cannot be be|held without admiration.</P>
<P>The Acropolis has now, as formerly, only one en|trance, which fronts the Piraeus. The a&s;cent is by traver&s;es, and rude fortifications, furni&s;hed with can|non; but without carriages, and neglected. By the
<PB N="355" REF="360">
&s;econd gate is the &s;tation of the guard; who &s;its cro&s;s-legged, under cover, much at his ea&s;e, &s;moaking his pipe, or drinking coffee; with his companions about him in like attitudes. Over this gateway is an in|&s;cription, in large characters, on a &s;tone turned up&s;ide down, and black from the fires made below. It re|cords the pre&s;ent of a pair of gates.</P>
<P>Farther up are the ruins of the propylea; an edi|fice which graces the entrance into the citadel. This was one of the &s;tructures of <HI>Pericles.</HI> It was com|pleted in five years, at the expence of two thou&s;and talents. It was of marble, of the Doric order, and had five doors, to afford an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age to the mul|titude, which re&s;orted on bu&s;ine&s;s, or devotion, to the Acropolis.</P>
<P>While this fabric was building, the architect, who&s;e activity equalled his &s;kill, was hurt by a fall, and the phy&s;icians de&s;paired of his life; but <HI>Minerva,</HI> who was propitious to the undertaking, appeared, it was &s;aid, to <HI>Pericles,</HI> and pre&s;cribed a remedy; by which he was &s;peedily and ea&s;ily cured. It was a plant, or herb, growing round about the Acropolis, and called afterwards Parthenium.</P>
<P>The right wing of the propylea was a temple of victory. On the left, and fronting the temple of
<PB N="356" REF="361">
victory, was a building, decorated with paintings, by <HI>Polygnotus;</HI> of which an account is given by <HI>Pau&s;a|nias.</HI> This edifice, as well as the temple, was of the Doric order; the columns fluted, and without ba&s;es. Both contributed alike to the uniformity, and gran|deur of the de&s;ign; and the whole fabric, when fi|ni&s;hed, was deemed equally magnificent and orna|mental. The interval, between <HI>Pericles</HI> and <HI>Pau&s;a|nias,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal centuries. The propylea re|mained entire, in the time of this topographer; and continued, nearly &s;o, to a much later period. It had then a roof of white marble, which was un-&s;urpa&s;&s;ed, either in the &s;ize of the &s;tones, or in the beauty of their arrangement; and, before each wing, was an eque&s;trian &s;tatue.</P>
<P>The propylea, or ve&s;tibules, have cea&s;ed to be the entrance of the Acropolis; The pa&s;&s;age, which was between the columns, is walled up almo&s;t to their capital; and above is a battery of cannon.</P>
<P>The temple of victory, &s;tanding on an abrupt rock, has the back, and one &s;ide, un-incumbered with the modern ramparts. The columns in the front be|ing walled up, you enter it by a breach in the &s;ide, within the propylea, or ve&s;tibules. It was u&s;ed by the Turks, as a magazine for powder, until about the year 1656; when a &s;udden explo&s;ion, occa&s;ioned by
<PB N="357" REF="362">
lightning, carried away the roof, with a hou&s;e erected on it, belonging to the officer who commanded in the Acropolis; who&s;e whole family, except a girl, pe|ri&s;hed, and it is now abandoned to ruins.</P>
<P>The building oppo&s;ite to the temple, has &s;erved as a foundation, for a &s;quare and lofty tower of ordi|nary ma&s;onry. The columns of the front of this building are likewi&s;e walled up, and the entrance is by a low iron gate in the &s;ide. It is now u&s;ed as a place of confinement for delinquents; but, in 1676, was a powder magazine. In the wall of a rampart, near it, are &s;ome pieces of exqui&s;ite &s;culpture; re|pre&s;enting the Athenians fighting with the Amazons. In the &s;econd century, when <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> lived, much of the painting was impaired by age; but &s;ome re|mained, and the &s;ubjects were chiefly taken from the Trojan &s;tory.</P>
<P><HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> mentions, with enthu&s;ia&s;m, the a&s;toni&s;hing whitene&s;s of the marble, employed in building the propylea; and the immen&s;e &s;ize of the pieces, &s;ome of which were two and twenty feet in length. The height of the five door-ways was the double of their breadth. The central one was twelve feet &s;even inches wide; the two next eight feet eight inches; and the two &s;malle&s;t, four feet four inches. The por|tico, to which the five door-ways belonged, con&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="358" REF="363">
of a large &s;quare room, roofed with &s;labs of marble, which were laid on two great marble beams, and &s;u&s;|tained by four beautiful columns. The roof of the propylea, after &s;tanding above two thou&s;and years, was probably de&s;troyed, with all the pediments, by the Venetians, in 1687; when they battered the ca&s;tle in front, firing red-hot bullets, and took it; but were compelled to re&s;ign it to the Turks, in the following year. The exterior walls, and in particular, a &s;ide of the temple of victory, retain many marks of their violence.</P>
<P>The chief ornament of the Acropolis was the par|thenon, or great temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI> a mo&s;t &s;uperb and magnificent fabric. The Per&s;ians had burned the edifice, which before occupied the &s;cite, and was called hecatompedon, from its being an hundred feet &s;quare. The zeal of <HI>Pericles,</HI> and of all the Athe|nians, was exerted, in providing a far more ample, and glorious re&s;idence, for their favourite godde&s;s. The architects were <HI>Callicrates</HI> and <HI>Ictinus;</HI> and a trea|ti&s;e, on the building, was written by the latter, and <HI>Carpion.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;tatue of <HI>Minerva,</HI> made for this temple by <HI>Phidias,</HI> was of ivory, thirty-nine feet high. It was decked with pure gold, to the amount of one hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds; &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, by the ad|vice

of <HI>Pericles,</HI> as to be taken off and weighed, if required. The godde&s;s was repre&s;ented &s;tanding, with her ve&s;tment reaching to her feet. Her helmet had a &s;phinx for the cre&s;t, and on the &s;ide were grif|fins. The head of <HI>Medu&s;a</HI> was her brea&s;t-plate. In one hand &s;he held her &s;pear, and in the other &s;up|ported an image of victory, about four cubits high. The battle of the Centaurs and Lapithae were carved on her &s;andals; and on her &s;hield, which lay at her feet, the war of the gods and giants, and the battle of the Athenians and Amazons. By her &s;pear was a &s;erpent, in allu&s;ion to the &s;tory of Ericthonius; and, on the pede&s;tal, the birth of Pandora. The &s;phinx, the victory, and the &s;erpent, were accounted emi|nently wonderful. This image was placed in the tem|ple, in the fir&s;t year of the eighty-&s;eventh Olympiad, in which the Peloponne&s;ian war began. The gold was &s;tripped off, by the tyrant <HI>Lacharez,</HI> when <HI>Deme|trius Poliorcetes</HI> compelled him to fly.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved of <HI>Phidias,</HI> that, as a &s;tatuary, he excelled in forming gods more than men; a &s;hort en|comium containing the &s;ubject of a panegyric. The <HI>Minerva</HI> of Athens, with a &s;tatue he made afterwards of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> at Olympia, rai&s;ed him far above com|petition in ivory. Such an arti&s;t de&s;erved to be ge|nerou&s;ly treated; but <HI>Phidias</HI> had enemies, as well as his patron. He had in&s;erted, in the &s;hield of <HI>Mi|nerva,</HI>
<PB N="360" REF="365">
a beautiful figure of <HI>Pericles,</HI> without his knowledge, fighting with an amazon, the face partly concealed; a hand, with a &s;pear extended before it, &s;eeming de&s;igned to prevent the likene&s;s from being perceived Much envy and obloquy followed, when that with our image was detected. <HI>Phidias</HI> was re|pre&s;ented as an old man, and bald, but with a pon|derous &s;tone uplifted in his hands; and this figure ce|menting, as it were, the whole work, could not be re|moved without its falling in pieces. He was accu&s;ed of having embezzled &s;ome ivory, by charging more for the &s;cales of the &s;erpent than had been con&s;umed. He fled to Elis, and was killed by the people, to &s;ecure their <HI>Jupiter</HI> from a rival.</P>
<P><HI>Minerva</HI> pre&s;erved her &s;tation in the Acropolis, during all the revolutions of the Athenian govern|ment; till the extirpation of gentili&s;m by <HI>Alaric.</HI> and his Goths. The potent and revered idol of <HI>Minerva</HI> then; it is likely, &s;ubmitted to the common plunderer of the Grecian cities; who levelled all their images, without di&s;tinction alike regardle&s;s whether they were heaven de&s;cended, or the works of <HI>Phidias.</HI></P>
<P>The Parthenon remained entire for many ages, after it was deprived of the godde&s;s. The Chri&s;tians con|verted it into a church, and the Mahometans into a mo&s;que. It is mentioned in the letters of <HI>Cru&s;ius,</HI>
<PB N="361" REF="366">
and mi&s;-called the <HI>Pantheon,</HI> and the temple of <HI>the un|known god.</HI> The Venetians, under <HI>Koning&s;mark,</HI> when they be&s;ieged the Acropolis, in 1687, threw a bomb, which demoli&s;hed the roof; and, &s;etting fire to &s;ome powder, did much damage to the fabric. The floor, which is indented, &s;till witne&s;&s;es the place of its fall. This was the &s;ad fore-runner of farther de&s;truction; the Turks breaking the &s;tones, and applying them to the building of a new mo&s;que, which &s;tands within the ruin; or to the repairing of their hou&s;es, and the walls of the fortre&s;s. The va&s;t pile of ponderous materials, which lay ready, is greatly dimini&s;hed; and the whole &s;tructure will gradually be con&s;umed, and di&s;-appear.</P>
<P>The temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI> in 1676, was, as <HI>Wheeler</HI> and <HI>Spon</HI> a&s;&s;ert, the fine&s;t mo&s;que in the world, with|out compari&s;on. The Greeks had adapted this fabric to their ceremonial, by con&s;tructing, at one end, a &s;emi-circular rece&s;s for the holy tables, with a win|dow; for, before, it was enlightened only by the door, ob&s;curity being preferred, under the heathen ritual, except on fe&s;tivals, when it yielded to &s;plendid illu|minations. In the wall, beneath the window, were in&s;erted two pieces of the &s;tone called Phengites; a a &s;pecies of marble, di&s;covered in Cappadocia, in the time of <HI>Nero;</HI> and &s;o tran&s;parent, that he erected with it a temple to Fortune; which was luminous
<PB N="362" REF="367">
within, when the door was &s;hut. The&s;e pieces were perforated, and the light which entered, was tinged with a reddi&s;h, or yellowi&s;h hue. The picture of the Panagia, or <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> in <HI>Mo&s;aic,</HI> on the ceiling of the rece&s;s, remained; with two ja&s;per columns belonging to the &s;kreen; and within, a canopy &s;up|ported by four pillars of porphyry, under which the table had been placed; and behind it, beneath the window, a marble chair for the archbi&s;hop, and al&s;o a pulpit, &s;tanding on four &s;mall pillars, in the middle ai&s;le. The Turks had white-wa&s;hed the walls, to ob|literate the portraits of &s;aints, and other paintings, with which the Greeks decorate their places of wor|&s;hip; and had erected a pulpit on their right hand, for their Iman, or reader.</P>
<P>The fabric, which is built of mo&s;t beautiful white marble, is in the form of a parallellogram, extending from Ea&s;t to We&s;t. Its length is two hundred and twenty-one feet, and the breadth ninety-four. The colonades which &s;urround the building are forty-&s;ix in number. Their diameter is five feet eight inches, and their height thirty-two. The di&s;tance between each column is &s;even feet four inches. Eight columns are in front, as many behind, and fifteen on each &s;ide; to which, if the four corner ones be added, there are &s;eventeen on each &s;ide; they are of the

Doric order, fluted, and without ba&s;es, and adorned with admirable &s;culpture.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to conceive a more &s;triking object than the Parthenon; though now a mere ruin. The columns within the naos have all been removed; but on the floor may be &s;een the circles which directed the work|men in placing them. The rece&s;s erected by the Chri&s;tians is demoli&s;hed, and from the rubbi&s;h of the ceiling the Turki&s;h boys collect bits of the Mo&s;aic, of different colours, which compo&s;ed the picture. This &s;ub&s;tance has been found &s;u&s;ceptible of a poli&s;h, and is &s;et in buckles. On the walls are &s;ome traces of the paintings.</P>
<P>The travellers to whom we are indebted for an ac|count of the mo&s;que, have likewi&s;e given a de&s;crip|tion of the &s;culpture then remaining in the front. In the middle of the pediment was &s;een a bearded <HI>Ju|piter,</HI> with a maje&s;tic countenance, &s;tanding, and naked; the right arm broken. The thunder-bolt it has been &s;uppo&s;ed was placed in that hand, and the eagle between his feet. On his right was a figure, it was conjectured of victory, clothed to the mid-leg; the head and arms gone. This was leaning on the hor&s;es of a car, in which <HI>Minerva</HI> &s;at, young and unarmed; her head-dre&s;s, in&s;tead of a helmet, re|&s;embling that of <HI>Venus.</HI> The generous ardour and
<PB N="364" REF="370">
lively &s;pirit, vi&s;ible in this pair of cele&s;tial &s;teeds, was &s;uch as be&s;poke the hand of a ma&s;ter bold and deli|cate, of a <HI>Phidias,</HI> or <HI>Praxiteles.</HI> Behind <HI>Minerva</HI> was a female figure without a head, &s;itting with an infant in her lap. On the left &s;ide of <HI>Jupiter</HI> were five or &s;ix other trunks to complete the a&s;&s;embly of deities, into which he received her. The&s;e figures were all wonderfully carved, and appeared as big as life. The re&s;t of the &s;tatues are defaced, removed, or fallen. In the other pediment is a head or two of &s;ea-hor&s;es, finely executed, with &s;ome mutilated figures.</P>
<P>It is to be regretted that &s;o much admirable &s;culp|ture, as is &s;till extant about this fabric, &s;hould be all likely to peri&s;h, as it were immaturely, from igno|rant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">empt and brutal violence. Numerous carved &s;tones have di&s;appeared; and many lying in the ruinous heaps, moved our indignation at the barbari&s;m daily exerci&s;ed in defacing them Be&s;ides, the two pediments, all the metopes were decorated with large figures in <HI>alto relievo,</HI> &s;everal of which are almo&s;t entire. The&s;e are exceedingly &s;triking, e&s;pe|cially when viewed with a due proportion of light and &s;hade. Their &s;ubject is the &s;ame as was cho&s;en for the &s;andals of <HI>Minerva,</HI> or the battle of the Cen|taurs and Lapithae. On the freeze of the cell, was carved in <HI>ba&s;&s;o relievo,</HI> the &s;olemnity of a &s;acrifice to
<PB N="365" REF="371">
<HI>Minerva,</HI> and of this one hundred and &s;eventy feet are &s;tanding, the greater part in good pre&s;ervation; containing a proce&s;&s;ion on hor&s;eback. On two &s;tones which have fallen, are oxen led as victims. On another, fourteen feet long, are the virgins, called Canephori, which a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the rites, bearing the &s;acred cani&s;ters on their heads, and in their hands, each a taper; with other figures, one a venerable per&s;on, with a beard, reading in a large volume, which is partly &s;upported by a boy. We purcha&s;ed two fine fragments of the freeze, which we found in|&s;erted over door-ways in the town; and were pre|&s;ented with a beautiful trunk, which had fallen from the metopes, and lay neglected in the garden of a Turk.</P>
<P>On the north &s;ide of the Parthenon, is a clu&s;ter of ruins, containing the erectheum, and the temple of <HI>Pandro&s;os,</HI> daughter of <HI>Cecrops.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Minerva,</HI> once rival deities, were joint and amicable tenants of the erectheum. The building was double, a partition-wall dividing it, which fronted different ways. One was the temple of <HI>Neptunus Erectheus,</HI> the other of <HI>Minerva Polias.</HI></P>
<P>The ruin of the erectheum, is of white marble, the architectural ornaments of very exqui&s;ite work|man&s;hip,
<PB N="366" REF="372">
and uncommonly curious. The columns of the front of the temple of <HI>Neptune</HI> are &s;tanding with the architrave, and al&s;o the &s;kreen and portico of <HI>Minerva Polias,</HI> with a portion of the cell retain|ing traces of the partition-wall. The order is Ionic. An edifice revered by ancient Attica, as holy in the highe&s;t degree, was in 1676 the dwelling of a Turki&s;h family; and is now de&s;erted and neglected; but many ponderous &s;tones and much rubbi&s;h mu&s;t be removed before the well and trident would appear. By the portico is a battery, commanding the town, from which the Turks fire, to give notice of the com|mencement of Ramazan, or of their Lent, and of Bairam, or the holy-days, and on other public occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Pandro&s;eum is a &s;mall, but very particular building, of which no &s;atisfactory idea can be com|municated by de&s;cription. The entablature is &s;up|ported by women, called Caryatides. Their &s;tory is thus related. The Greeks, victorious in the Per|&s;ian war, jointly de&s;troyed Carya, a city of Pelo|ponne&s;us, which had favoured the common enemy. They cut off the males, and carried into captivity the women, whom they compelled to retain their former dre&s;s and ornaments, though in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude. The architects of tho&s;e times, to per|petuate the memory of their puni&s;hment, repre&s;ented
<PB N="367" REF="373">
them, as in this in&s;tance, each with a burthen on her head, one hand uplifted to it, and the other hang|ing down by the &s;ide. The images were in number &s;ix, all looking towards the Parthenon. The four in front, with that next to the Propylea, remain, but mutilated, and their faces be&s;meared with paint. The &s;oil is ri&s;en almo&s;t to the top of the ba&s;ement, on which they are placed. This temple was open, or latticed between the &s;tatues; and in it al&s;o was a &s;tunted olive-tree, with an altar of <HI>Jupiter Herceus</HI> &s;tanding under it. The Propylea are nearly in a line with the &s;pace, dividing it from the Parthenon; which di&s;po&s;ition, be&s;ides its other effects, occa&s;ioned the front, and flank of the latter edifice, to be &s;een at once by them who approached it from the entrance of the Acropolis.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;tatue of <HI>Minerva Polias,</HI> which was of olive, and that in the Parthenon, the Acropolis po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a third, which was of bra&s;s, and &s;o tall that the point of the &s;pear, and the cre&s;t of the hel|met, were vi&s;ible from Sunium. It was an offering made with a tenth of the &s;poils taken at Marathon, and dedicated to the godde&s;s. The arti&s;t was <HI>Phidias.</HI> It remained to the time of <HI>Arcadius</HI> and <HI>Honorius;</HI> and <HI>Minerva,</HI> it was &s;aid, appeared to <HI>Alaric,</HI> as re|pre&s;ented in this image. There were likewi&s;e &s;ome images of her, which e&s;caped the flames when <HI>Xerxes</HI>
<PB N="368" REF="374">
&s;et fire to the Acropolis. The&s;e in the &s;econd cen|tury were entire, but unu&s;ually black, and moulder|ing with age.</P>
<P>The hill of the Acropolis, on the &s;ide towards mount Hymettus, is indented near the end with the &s;ite of the theatre of <HI>Bacchus.</HI> This was a very ca|pacious edifice, near the mo&s;t ancient temple of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and adorned with images of the tragic and comic poets. Some &s;tone-work remains at the two extremities, but the area is ploughed, and produces grain. The Athenians invented both the drama and the theatre; the latter originally a temporary &s;tructure of wood; but while a play of <HI>Ae&s;chilus</HI> was acting, the &s;caffolds fell; and it was then re&s;olved to provide a &s;olid and durable edifice. The &s;lope of the hill, on which perhaps the &s;pectators had been accu&s;tomed to a&s;&s;emble, was cho&s;en for the building; and the &s;eats were di&s;po&s;ed in rows, ri&s;ing one above another, each re&s;ting on the rock as its foundation.</P>
