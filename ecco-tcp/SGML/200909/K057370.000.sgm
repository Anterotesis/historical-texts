<P><HI>[71&mdash;74]</HI> The conver&s;e true of Vice.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2d. [75&mdash;88]</HI> From Pride. The natural excellencies of the body or mind, when &s;urveyed, nece&s;&s;arily give a &s;pecies of plea&s;ure which we call &s;elf-complacency or pride: this emo|tion is &s;tronger on the perception of tho&s;e degrees of perfection, which we give birth to in our&s;elves, by acts of the will; and is &s;till augmented in proportion of the dignity of the end by which it is put in action; the highe&s;t gratification of this in&s;tinct is therefore, the contemplation of tho&s;e of our own actions, to which &s;ome virtue was the end.</P>
<P><HI>[89&mdash;92]</HI> From Shame. The conver&s;e of the former argu|ment holds good, as vice is attended with the greate&s;t degree of &s;hame.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3d. [93&mdash;206]</HI> From Self-love. Self-love actuates our hopes and fears from a con&s;ideration of&mdash;<HI>1&s;t,</HI> our pre&s;ent, and&mdash;<HI>2dly,</HI> our future &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>[93&mdash;134]</HI> From the pre&s;ent State.&mdash;Tho&s;e actions which promote the felicity of Society, (or the moral virtues) natu|rally bring their own rewards with them: Tho&s;e which ob&s;truct it, (or vices) their re&s;pective puni&s;hments. Whence according to the nature of our actions, we are filled with
<PB N="3" REF="5">the hopes of the&s;e rewards, or the fear of the&s;e puni&s;h|ments: and as the mind is always more employed in con|&s;idering the future, than either the pre&s;ent or the pa&s;t, the&s;e future expectations (which contribute to compo&s;e that moral &s;en&s;e, named Con&s;cience) form the greater part of our pre|&s;ent happine&s;s or mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><HI>[135&mdash;206]</HI> From a future State.&mdash;Our hopes are &s;trongly excited by the views of that eternal happine&s;s, our fears by the repre&s;entation of the divine ju&s;tice revelation has given us. Digre&s;&s;ion. De&s;cription of the divine ju&s;tice; her infinity; her almighty power to protect&mdash;or puni&s;h. She de&s;cends upon earth to cha&s;ti&s;e the &s;ins of men; the effects of her vengeance. The terror a con&s;ideration of this mu&s;t in&s;pire in the brea&s;t of the wicked, and more particularly on the point of death.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V. [207&mdash;648]</HI> The <HI>FINAL CAUSES</HI> of <HI>CONSCIENCE.&mdash;1&s;t,</HI> to excite repentance&mdash;<HI>2dly,</HI> to counterpoi&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;<HI>3dly,</HI> to render the happine&s;s of individuals more propor|tioned to their moral merits.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t. [213&mdash;220]</HI> Con&s;cience excites us by repentance to appea&s;e the divine ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly. [221&mdash;262]</HI> It counterpoizes the pa&s;&s;ions, by making them &s;ub&s;ervient to the general good; which otherwi&s;e would
<PB N="4" REF="6">engage us in exce&s;&s;es the mo&s;t de&s;tructive to &s;ociety. It introduces the fine&s;t moral harmony in the mind; and reconciles all the various pur&s;uits of life to univer&s;al happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly. [263&mdash;648]</HI> Vice is frequently &s;ucce&s;sful, and virtue depre&s;t in the world: Con&s;cience, by being the &s;ecret puni&s;h|ment of the former, and the &s;upport of the latter, renders the happine&s;s of each, more proportioned to the moral merit of individuals: and thus forms a nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplement to the external admini&s;tration of providence.</P>
<P><HI>[273&mdash;578]</HI> Hence unre&s;trained Avarice, Ambition, Sen|&s;uality, and other crimes derive their &s;ecret puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>[579&mdash;610]</HI> And from hence the man of virtue when di&s;tre&s;t, experiences a &s;upport, enabling him to triumph over or de&s;pi&s;e the afflictions of life.</P>
<P><HI>[611&mdash;648]</HI> While its influence gives new plea&s;ure to all its finer enjoyments, and exalts pro&s;perity into happine&s;s.</P>

<L><MILESTONE N="45"><NOTE PLACE="foot">(V. 45.) Con&s;cience is defined to be a &s;en&s;e of plea&s;ure or pain; not a bare ab&s;tract perception of the mind, exclu&s;ive of an operation on the pa&s;&s;ions: becau&s;e &s;uch a perception mu&s;t terminate in it&s;elf, and can never become a &s;ource of action, any more than the ab&s;tract deductions of geometry or any other &s;cience; and Con&s;cience is an active principle.</NOTE> This MORAL SENSE of PLEASURE and of PAIN,</L>
<L>Of CONSCIENCE forms the wide extended reign.</L>
<L>From THREE great principles by Heav'n impre&s;t,</L>
<L>She holds her empire o'er the human brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Mild SYMPATHY, with PRIDE's more ardent &s;way;<NOTE PLACE="foot">(V. 49.) The term Pride mu&s;t be under&s;tood in a philo&s;ophical &s;en&s;e, as a natural plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the view of its object; not as oppo&s;ed to the virtue of humility, in which &s;en&s;e it is a vice. The advan|tages of life are &s;urveyed with plea&s;ure; the means by which the&s;e are procured are therefore plea&s;ing, by the operation of the mind a&s;&s;ociating the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the contemplation of the end, with the idea of the means: the foremo&s;t among the&s;e we reckon the natural excellencies of the body or mind: thus 'tis proved, there mu&s;t exi&s;t &s;uch a plea&s;ure as &s;elf-complacence or pride, from a view of our natural perfections; if nature has not given us an original primary in&s;tinct, which makes the natural advantages nece&s;&s;arily and per &s;e give plea&s;ure to their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors. Ours is not the only language which wants a term which may expre&s;s &s;elf-complacency, without the danger of being mi&s;under&s;tood without &s;ome explanation. Since the writing the above I have happened of the following ob&s;ervation on the word <HI>orgueil,</HI> which one of the be&s;t modern French poets wanted to have introduced in the &s;en&s;e I have u&s;ed the term Pride.&mdash;"J'aurois &s;ub&s;titu&eacute; le mot d'orgueil a ces mots, &s;entiment de nos forces, de nos qualit&eacute;s, &amp;c. mais dans notre langue le mot d'or|gueil &s;e prend toujours en mauvai&s;e part."
