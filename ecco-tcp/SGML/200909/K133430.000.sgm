<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I HERE pre&s;ent the Public with a new performance. Some parts of it are more particularly adapted to the State of Penn&s;yl|vania, on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of its affairs: But there are others which are on a larger &s;cale. The time be&s;towed on this work has not been long, the whole of it being written and printed during the &s;hort rece&s;s of the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>As to parties, merely con&s;idered as &s;uch, I am attached to no particular one. There are &s;uch things as right and wrong in the world, and &s;o far as the&s;e are parties again&s;t each other, the &s;ignature of <HI>COMMON SENSE</HI> is properly employed.</P>

<P><GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page">of &s;uch powers only as are con&s;tituent parts of the go|vernment, not of tho&s;e powers which are externally ap|plied to re&s;i&s;t and overturn it.</P>
<P>IN Republics, &s;uch as tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed in America, the &s;overeign power, or the power over which there is no controul and which controuls all others, remains where nature placed it; in the people; for the people in America are the fountain of power. It remains there as a matter of right, recognized in the con&s;titutions of the country, and the exerci&s;e of it is con&s;titutional and legal.&mdash;This &s;overeignty is exerci&s;ed in electing and deputing a certain number of per&s;ons to repre&s;ent and act for the whole, and who, if they do not act right, may be di&s;placed by the &s;ame power that placed them there, and others elected and deputed in their &s;tead, and the wrong mea&s;ures of former repre&s;entatives corrected and brought right by this means. Therefore the republican form and principle leaves no room for in&s;urrection, becau&s;e it provides and e&s;tabli&s;hes a rightful means in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>IN countries under a de&s;potic form of government, the exerci&s;e of this power is an a&s;&s;umption of &s;overeignty; a wre&s;ting it from the per&s;on in who&s;e hand their form of government has placed it, and the exerci&s;e of it there is &s;tiled rebellion. Therefore the de&s;potic form of govern|ment knows no intermediate &s;pace between being &s;laves and being rebels.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in this place offer an ob&s;ervation which, though not immediately connected with my &s;ubject, is very na|turally deduced from it, which is, That the nature, if I may &s;o call it, of a government over any people may be a&s;certained from the modes which the people pur&s;ue to obtain redre&s;s; for like cau&s;es will produce like effects. And therefore the government which Britain attempted to erect over America could be no other than a de&s;poti&s;m, becau&s;e it left to the Americans no other modes of re|dre&s;s than tho&s;e which are left to people under de&s;potic governments, petition and re&s;i&s;tance: and the Ame|ricans, without ever attending to a compari&s;on on the ca&s;e, went into the &s;ame &s;teps which &s;uch people go into, becau&s;e no other could be pur&s;ued: and this &s;imilarity of effects leads up to, and a&s;certains, the &s;imilarity of the cau&s;es or governments which produced them.</P>
<P>BUT to return.&mdash;The repo&s;itory where the &s;overeign power is placed is the fir&s;t criterion of di&s;tinction between
<PB N="3" REF="4">a country under a de&s;potic form of government and a free country. In a country under a de&s;potic government, the &s;overeign is the only free man in it.&mdash;In a republic, the people retaining the &s;overeignty in them&s;elves, naturally and nece&s;&s;arily retain freedom with it: for, wherever the &s;overeignty is, there mu&s;t the freedom be; the one cannot be in one place and the other in another.</P>
<P>As the repo&s;itory where the &s;overeign power is lodged is the fir&s;t criterion of di&s;tinction; the &s;econd is the principles on which it is admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>A de&s;potic government knows no principle but WILL. Whatever the &s;overeign wills to do, the government ad|mits him the inherent right, and the uncontrouled power of doing. He is re&s;trained by no fixed rule of right and wrong, for he makes the right and wrong him&s;elf and as he plea&s;es.&mdash;If he happens (for a miracle may happen) to be a man of con&s;ummate wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice and modera|tion, of a mild affectionate di&s;po&s;ition, di&s;po&s;ed to bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and under&s;tanding and promoting the general good, all the beneficial purpo&s;es of government will be an&s;wered under his admini&s;tration, and the people &s;o go|verned may, while this is the ca&s;e, be pro&s;perous and ea&s;y. But as there can be no &s;ecurity that this di&s;po&s;i|tion will la&s;t, and this admini&s;tration continue, and &s;till le&s;s &s;ecurity that his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hall have the &s;ame qualities and pur&s;ue the &s;ame mea&s;ures; therefore no people exer|ci&s;ing their rea&s;on and under&s;tanding their rights, would, of their own choice, inve&s;t any one man with &s;uch a power.</P>
<P>NEITHER is it con&s;i&s;tent to &s;uppo&s;e the knowledge of any one man competent to the exerci&s;e of &s;uch a power. A Sovereign of this &s;ort, is brought up in &s;uch a di&s;tant line of life, and lives &s;o remote from the people, and from a knowledge of every thing which relates to their local &s;itu|ations and intere&s;ts, that he can know nothing from ex|perience and ob&s;ervation, and all which he does know he mu&s;t be told. Sovereign power without &s;overeign know|ledge, that is, a full knowledge of all the matters over which that power is to be exerci&s;ed, is a &s;omething which contradicts it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THERE is a &s;pecies of &s;overeign power in a &s;ingle per|&s;on, which is very proper when applied to a commander in chief over an army, &s;o far as relates to the military go|vernment of an army, and the condition and purpo&s;e of an army con&s;titute the rea&s;on why it is &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">IN an army every man is of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, that is, he is a &s;oldier, and the commander in chief is a &s;ol|dier too: therefore the knowledge nece&s;&s;ary to the exer|ci&s;e of the power is within him&s;elf. By under&s;tanding what a &s;oldier is, he comprehends the local &s;ituation, in|tere&s;t and duty of every man within, what may be called, the dominion of his command; and therefore the condition and circum&s;tances of an army make fitne&s;s for the exerci&s;e of the power.</P>
<P>THE purpo&s;e likewi&s;e, or object of an army, is another rea&s;on: for this power in a commander in chief, though exerci&s;ed over the army, is not exerci&s;ed again&s;t it; but is exerci&s;ed thro' or over the army again&s;t the enemy. Therefore the enemy, and not the people, is the object it is directed to. Neither is it exerci&s;ed over an army, for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue from it, but to promote its combined intere&s;t, conden&s;e its powers, and give it capacity for action.</P>
<P>BUT all the&s;e rea&s;ons cea&s;e when &s;overeign power is transferred from the commander of an army to the com|mander of a nation, and entirely lo&s;es its fitne&s;s when ap|plied to govern &s;ubjects following occupations, as it go|verns &s;oldiers following arms. A nation is quite another elem&egrave;nt, and every thing in it differs not only from each other, but all of them differ from tho&s;e of an army. A nation is compo&s;ed of di&s;tinct unconnected individuals, following various trades, employments and pur&s;uits; con|tinually meeting, cro&s;&s;ing, uniting, oppo&s;ing and &s;epa|rating from each other as accident, intere&s;t and circum|&s;tance &s;hall direct.&mdash;An army has but one occupation and but one intere&s;t.</P>
<P>ANOTHER very material matter in which an army and a nation differ, is that of temper. An army may be &s;aid to have but one temper; for, however the <HI>natural</HI> temper of the per&s;ons compo&s;ing the army may differ from each other, there is a &s;econd temper takes place of the fir&s;t: a temper formed by di&s;cipline, mutuality of habits, union of objects and pur&s;uits, and the &s;tile of mi|litary manners: but this can never be the ca&s;e among all the individuals of a nation. Therefore the fitne&s;s, ari&s;ing from tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which di&s;po&s;es an army to the command of a &s;ingle per&s;on, and the fitne&s;s of a &s;ingle per&s;on to that command, is not to be found either in one or the other, when we come to con&s;ider them as a &s;ove|reign and a nation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">HAVING already &s;hewn what a de&s;potic government is, and how it is admini&s;tered, I now come to &s;hew what the admini&s;tration of a republic is.</P>
<P>THE admini&s;tration of a republic is &s;uppo&s;ed to be di|rected by certain fundamental principles of right and ju&s;tice, from which there cannot, becau&s;e there ought not to, be any deviation; and whenever and deviation appears, there is a kind of &s;tepping out of the republican principle, and an approach towards the de&s;potic one. This admini&s;tration is executed by a &s;elect number of per&s;ons, periodically cho&s;en by the people, and act as re|pre&s;entatives and in behalf of the whole, and who are &s;up|po&s;ed to enact the &s;ame laws, and pur&s;ue the &s;ame line of admini&s;tration, as the whole of the people would do were they a&s;&s;embled together.</P>
<P>THE PUBLIC GOOD is to be their object. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand what Public Good is.</P>
<P>PUBLIC Good is not a term oppo&s;ed to the good of in|dividuals; on the contrary, it is the good of every indi|vidual collected. It is the good of all, becau&s;e it is the good of every one: for as the public body is every indi|vidual collected, &s;o the public good is the collected good of tho&s;e individuals.</P>
<P>THE foundation-principle of Public Good is ju&s;tice, and wherever ju&s;tice is impartially admini&s;tered the public good is promoted; for as it is to the good of every man that no inju&s;tice be done to him, &s;o likewi&s;e it is to his good that the principle which &s;ecures him &s;hould not be violated in the per&s;on of another, becau&s;e &s;uch a violation weakens <HI>his</HI> &s;ecurity, and leaves to chance what ought to be to him a rock to &s;tand on.</P>
<P>BUT in order to under&s;tand more minutely, how the Public Good is to be promoted, and the manner in which the repre&s;entatives are to act to promote it, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the original or fir&s;t principles, on which the people formed them&s;elves into a republic.</P>
<P>WHEN a people agree to form them&s;elves into a republic (for the word REPUBLIC means the PUBLIC GOOD, or the good of the whole, in contradi&s;tinction to the de&s;potic form, which makes the good of the &s;overeign, or of one man, the only object of the government) when, I &s;ay, they agree to do this, it is to be under&s;tood, that they mutually re&s;olve and pledge them&s;elves to each other, rich and poor alike, to &s;upport and maintain this rule of
<PB N="6" REF="7">equal ju&s;tice among them. They therefore renounce not only the de&s;potic form, but the de&s;potic principle, as well of governing as of being governed by mere Will and Power, and &s;ub&s;titute in its place a government of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>BY this mutual compact the citizens of a republic put it out of their power, that is, they renounce, as dete&s;t|able, the power of exerci&s;ing, at any future time, any &s;pecies of de&s;poti&s;m over each other, or doing a thing, not right in it&s;elf, becau&s;e a majority of them may have &s;trength or numbers &s;ufficient to accompli&s;h it.</P>
<P>IN this pledge and compact<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This pledge and compact is contained in the declaration of Rights prefixed to the con&s;titution, and is as follows&mdash;
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THAT all men are born equally free and independ|ent, and have certain natural, inherent and una|lienable rights, among&s;t which are the enjoying and defend|ing life and liberty, acquiring, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and protecting property, and pur&s;uing and obtaining happine&s;s and &s;afety.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THAT all men have a natural and unalienable right to wor&s;hip Almighty God, according to the dictates of their own con&s;ciences and under&s;tanding: And that no man ought or of right can be compelled to attend any religious wor&s;hip, or erect or &s;upport any place of wor&s;hip, or maintain any mini&s;try, contrary to, or again&s;t, his own free will and con|&s;ent: Nor can any man. who acknowledges the being of a God, be ju&s;tly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a citizen, on account of his religious &s;entiments or peculiar mode of religious wor&s;hip: And that no authority can or ought to be ve&s;ted in, or a&s;&s;umed by any power whatever, that &s;hall in any ca&s;e interfere with, or in any manner con|troul, the right of con&s;cience in the free exerci&s;e of religious wor&s;hip.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. THAT the people of this &s;tate have the &s;ole, exclu&s;ive and inherent right of governing and regulating the internal police of the &s;ame.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. THAT all power being originally inherent in, and con&s;equently derived from, the people; therefore all officers of government, whether legi&s;lative or executive, are their tru&s;tees and &s;ervants, and at all times accountable to them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. THAT government is, or ought to be, in&s;tituted for the common benefit, protection and &s;ecurity of the people, nation or community; and not for the particular emolument or advantage of any &s;ingle man, family or &s;et of men who are a part only of that community: And that the community hath an indubitable, unalienable and indefea&s;ible right to reform, alter or aboli&s;h government in &s;uch manner as &s;hall be by that community judged mo&s;t conducive to the public weal.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. THAT tho&s;e who are employed in the legi&s;lative and executive bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate may be re&s;trained from op|pre&s;&s;ion, the people have a right, at &s;uch periods as they may think proper, to reduce their public officers to a private &s;tation, and &s;upply the vacancies by certain and regular elections.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. THAT all elections ought to be free; and that all free men having a &s;ufficient evident common intere&s;t with, and attachment to the community, have a right to elect of|ficers, or be elected into office.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. THAT every member of &s;ociety hath a right to be protected in the enjoyment of life, liberty and property, and therefore is bound to contribute his proportion towards the expence of that protection, and yield his per&s;onal &s;ervice when nece&s;&s;ary, or an equivalent thereto: But no part of a man's property can be ju&s;tly taken from him, or applied to public u&s;es, without his own con&s;ent, or that of his legal repre&s;entatives: Nor can any man who is con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;crupulous of bearing arms, be ju&s;tly compelled thereto, if he will pay &s;uch equivalent: Nor are the people bound by any laws, but &s;uch as they have in like manner a&s;&s;ented to, for their common good.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. THAT in all pro&s;ecutions for criminal offences, a man hath a right to be heard by him&s;elf and his council, to de|mand the cau&s;e and nature of his accu&s;ation, to be confront|ed with the witne&s;&s;es, to call for evidence in his favour, and a &s;peedy public trial, by an impartial jury of the country, without the unanimous con&s;ent of which jury he cannot be found guilty: Nor can he be compelled to give evidence a|gain&s;t him&s;elf: Nor can any man be ju&s;tly deprived of his liberty, except by the laws of the land, or the judgment of his peers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>X. THAT the people have a right to hold them&s;elves, their hou&s;es, papers, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions free from &s;earch or &s;eizure; and therefore warrants without oaths or affirmations fir&s;t made, affording a &s;ufficient foundation for them, and where|by any officer or me&s;&s;enger may be commanded or required to &s;earch &s;u&s;pected places, or to &s;eize any per&s;on or per&s;ons, his or their property, not particularly de&s;cribed, are con|trary to that right, and ought not to be granted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XI. THAT in controver&s;ies re&s;pecting property, and in &s;uits between man and man, the parties have a right to trial by jury, which ought to be held &s;acred.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XII. THAT the people have a right to freedom of &s;peech, and of writing, and publi&s;hing their &s;entiments; therefore the freedom of the pre&s;s ought not to be re&s;trained.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XIII. THAT the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of them&s;elves and the &s;tate; and as &s;tanding armies in the time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up: And that the military &s;hould be kept under &s;trict &s;ubordination to, and governed by, the civil power.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XIV. THAT a frequent recurrence to fundamental prin|ciples, and a firm adherence to ju&s;tice, moderation, tem|perance, indu&s;try and frugality are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty and keep a government free: The people ought therefore to pay particular attention to the&s;e points in the choice of officers and repre&s;entatives, and have a right to exact a due and con&s;tant regard to them, from their legi&s;lators and magi&s;trates, in the making and executing &s;uch laws as are nece&s;&s;ary for the good government of the &s;tate.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XV. THAT all men have a natural inherent right to emigrate from one &s;tate to another that will receive them, or to form a new &s;tate in vacant countries, or in &s;uch coun|tries as they can purcha&s;e, whenever they think that there|by they may promote their own happine&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XVI. THAT the people have a right to a&s;&s;emble toge|ther, to con&s;ult for their common good, to in&s;truct their re|pre&s;entatives, and to apply to the legi&s;lature for redre&s;s of grievances, by addre&s;s, petition, or remon&s;trance.</ITEM>
</LIST></NOTE> lies the foundation of the
<PB N="7" REF="8">republic: and the &s;ecurity to the rich and the con&s;olation to the poor is, that what each man has is his own; that no de&s;potic &s;overeign can take it from him, and that the common cementing principle which holds all the parts of a republic together, &s;ecures him likewi&s;e from the de&s;po|ti&s;m of numbers: For de&s;poti&s;m may be more effectually acted by many over a few than by one man over all.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, in order to know how far the power of an A&s;&s;embly, or a hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives can act in admini&s;tering the affairs of a republic, we mu&s;t examine how far the power of the people extends under the ori|ginal compact they have made with each other; for the power of the repre&s;entatives is in many ca&s;es le&s;s, but never can be greater than that of the people repre&s;ented; and whatever the people in their mutual original com|pact have renounced the power of doing towards, or act|ing over each other, the repre&s;entatives can not a&s;&s;ume the power to do, becau&s;e, as I have already &s;aid, the pow|er of the repre&s;entatives cannot be greater than that of the people whom they repre&s;ent.</P>

IN this place it naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf that the people in their original compact of equal ju&s;tice or fir&s;t prin|ciples of a republic, renounced, as de&s;potic, dete&s;table and unju&s;t, the a&s;&s;uming a right of breaking and violating their engagements, contracts and compacts with, or defraud|ing, impo&s;ing or tyrannizing over, each other, and therefore the repre&s;entatives can not make an Act to do it for them, and any &s;uch an Act would be an attempt to depo&s;e, not the per&s;onal &s;overeign, but the &s;overeign principle of the republic, and to introduce de&s;poti&s;m in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>IT may in this place be proper to di&s;tingui&s;h between that &s;pecies of &s;overeignty which is claimed and exerci&s;ed by de&s;potic monarchs, and that &s;overeignty which the citizens of a republic inherit and retain.&mdash;The &s;ove|reignty of a de&s;potic monarch a&s;&s;umes the power of mak|ing wrong right, or right wrong, as he plea&s;es or as it &s;uits him. The &s;overeignty in a republic is exerci&s;ed to keep right and wrong in their proper and di&s;tinct places, and never to &s;uffer the one to u&s;urp the place of the other. A republic, properly under&s;tood, is a &s;overeignty of ju&s;tice in contradi&s;tinction to a &s;overeignty of Will.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12">OUR experience in republicani&s;m is yet &s;o &s;lender, that it is much to be doubted, whether all our public Laws and Acts are con&s;i&s;tent with, or can be ju&s;tified on, the prin|ciples of a republican government.</P>
<P>WE have been &s;o much habited to act in committees at the commencement of the di&s;pute, and during the in|terregnum of government, and in many ca&s;es &s;ince, and to adopt expedients warranted by nece&s;&s;ity, and to permit to our&s;elves a di&s;cretionary u&s;e of power &s;uited to the &s;pur and exigency of the moment, that a man transferred from a committee to a &s;eat in the Legi&s;lature imperceptibly takes with him the ideas and habits he has been accu|&s;tomed to, and continues to think like a committee-man in&s;tead of a legi&s;lator, and to govern by &s;pirit rather than by the rule of the con&s;titution and the principles of the Republic.</P>
<P>HAVING already &s;tated that the power of the repre|&s;entatives can never exceed the power of the people whom they repre&s;ent, I now proceed to examine more particu|larly, what the power of the repre&s;entatives is.</P>
<P>IT is, in the fir&s;t place, the power of acting as legi&s;la|lators in making laws,&mdash;and in the &s;econd place, the power of acting in certain ca&s;es, as agents or negociators for the Commonwealth, for &s;uch purpo&s;es as the circum|&s;tances of the Commonwealth require.</P>
<P>A VERY &s;trange confu&s;ion of ideas dangerous to the credit, &s;tability, and the good and honor of the Common|wealth has ari&s;en by confounding tho&s;e two di&s;tinct pow|ers
<PB N="10" REF="13">and things together, and blending every Act of the A&s;&s;embly, of whatever kind it may be, under one general name of <HI>"Laws of the Commonwealth,"</HI> and thereby creat|ing an opinion (which is truly of the de&s;potic kind) that every &s;ucceeding A&s;&s;embly has an equal power over every tran&s;action, as well as law, done by a former A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>ALL laws are Acts, but all Acts are not laws. Many of the Acts of the A&s;&s;embly are Acts of agency or negocia|tion, that is, they are Acts of contract and agreement, on the part of the State, with certain per&s;ons therein men|tioned, and for certain purpo&s;es therein recited. An Act of this kind, after it has pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e, is of the nature of a deed or contract, &s;igned, &s;ealed and delivered; and &s;ubject to the &s;ame general laws and principles of ju&s;tice as all other deeds and contracts are: for in a tran&s;action of this kind the State &s;tands as an individual, and can be known in no other character in a court of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>By "LAWS" as di&s;tinct from the agency tran&s;actions, or matters of negociation, are to be comprehended all tho&s;e public Acts of the A&s;&s;embly or Commonwealth, which have a univer&s;al operation, or apply them&s;elves to every individual of the Commonwealth. Of this kind are the laws for the di&s;tribution and admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, for the pre&s;ervation of the peace, for the &s;ecurity of property, for rai&s;ing the nece&s;&s;ary revenue by ju&s;t proportions, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>ACTS of this kind are properly LAWS, and they may
<PB N="11" REF="14">be altered and amended or repealed, or others &s;ub&s;tituted in their places, as experience &s;hall direct, for the better effecting the purpo&s;e for which they were intended: and the right and power of the A&s;&s;embly to do this, is derived from the right and power which the people, were they all a&s;&s;embled together, in&s;tead of being repre&s;ented, would have to do the &s;ame thing: becau&s;e, in Acts or laws of this kind, there is no other party than the public. The law, or the alteration, or the repeal, is for them&s;elves;&mdash; and whatever the effects may be, it falls on them&s;elves;&mdash; if for the better, they have the benefit of it&mdash;if for the wor&s;e, they &s;uffer the inconvenience. No violence to any one is here offered&mdash;no breach of faith is here committed. It is therefore one of the&s;e rights and pow|ers which is within the &s;en&s;e, meaning and limits of the original compact of ju&s;tice which they formed with each other as the foundation principle of the Republic, and being one of tho&s;e rights and powers, it devolves on their repre&s;entatives by delegation.</P>
<P>As it is not my intention (neither is it within the limits a&s;&s;igned to this work) to define every &s;pecies of what may be called LAWS, (but rather to di&s;tingui&s;h that part in which the repre&s;entatives act as agents or negoci|ators for the State, from the legi&s;lative part,) I &s;hall pa&s;s on to di&s;tingui&s;h and de&s;cribe tho&s;e Acts of the A&s;&s;embly which are Acts of agency or negociation, and to &s;hew that as they are different in their nature, con&s;truction and operation from legi&s;lative Acts, &s;o likewi&s;e the power and authority of the A&s;&s;embly over them, after they are pa&s;&s;ed, is different.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t occur to every per&s;on on the fir&s;t reflection, that the affairs and circum&s;tances of a Commonwealth re|quire other bu&s;ine&s;s to be done be&s;ides that of making laws, and con&s;equently, that the different kinds of bu&s;i|ne&s;s cannot all be cla&s;&s;ed under one name, or be &s;ubject to one and the &s;ame rule of treatment.&mdash; But to proceed&mdash;</P>
<P>BY agency tran&s;actions, or matters of negociation, done by the A&s;&s;embly, are to be comprehended all that kind of public bu&s;ine&s;s, which the A&s;&s;embly, as repre&s;en|tatives of the Republic, tran&s;act in its behalf, with certain per&s;on or per&s;ons, or part or parts of the Republic, for purpo&s;es mentioned in the Act, and which the A&s;&s;embly confirm and ratify on the part of the Commonwealth, by affixing to it the &s;eal of the State.</P>

AN Act of this kind, differs from a law of the before mentioned kind; becau&s;e here are two parties and there but one, and the parties are bound to perform different and di&s;tinct parts: whereas, in the before mentioned law, every man's part was the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THESE Acts, therefore, though numbered among the laws, are evidently di&s;tinct therefrom, and are not of the legi&s;lative kind. The former are laws for the govern|ment of the Commonwealth; the&s;e are tran&s;actions of bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch as, &s;elling and conveying an e&s;tate belong|ing to the public, or buying one; Acts for borrowing money, and fixing with the lender the terms and mode of payment; Acts of agreement and contract, with cer|tain per&s;on or per&s;ons, for certain purpo&s;es; and, in &s;hort, every kind of Act in which two parties, the State being one, are particularly mentioned or de&s;cribed, and in which the form and nature of a bargain or contract is comprehended.&mdash;The&s;e, if for cu&s;tom and uniformity &s;ake we call by the name of LAWS, they are not laws for the government of the Commonwealth, but for the go|vernment of the contracting parties, as all deeds and contracts are; and are not, properly &s;peaking, Acts of the A&s;&s;embly, but joint Acts, or Acts of the A&s;&s;embly in behalf of the Commonwealth on one part, and certain per&s;ons therein mentioned on the other part.</P>
<P>ACTS of this kind are di&s;tingui&s;hable into two cla&s;&s;es.&mdash;</P>
<P>FIRST, tho&s;e wherein the matters in&s;erted in the Act have already been &s;ettled and adju&s;ted between the State on one part, and the per&s;ons therein mentioned on the other part. In this ca&s;e the Act is the completion and ratifi|cation of the contract or matters therein recited. It is in fact a deed &s;igned, &s;ealed and delivered.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, tho&s;e Acts wherein the matters have not been already agreed upon, and wherein the Act only holds forth certain propo&s;itions and terms to be accepted of and acceded to.</P>
<P>I SHALL give an in&s;tance of each of tho&s;e Acts. Fir&s;t&mdash;The State wants the loan of a &s;um of money&mdash;cer|tain per&s;ons make an offer to Government to lend that &s;um, and &s;end in their propo&s;als: the Government ac|cept the&s;e propo&s;als and all the matters of the loan and the payment are agreed on; and an Act is pa&s;&s;ed, according to the u&s;ual form of pa&s;&s;ing Acts, ratifying and confirming this agreement. This Act is final.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="18">IN the &s;econd ca&s;e,&mdash;The State, as in the preceding one, wants a loan of money&mdash;the A&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;es an Act holding forth the terms on which it will borrow and pay: this Act has no force, until the propo&s;itions and terms are accepted of and acceded to by &s;ome per&s;on or per&s;ons, and when tho&s;e terms are accepted of and complied with the Act is binding on the State.&mdash;But if at the meeting of the next A&s;&s;embly, or any other, the whole &s;um intended to be borrowed, &s;hould not be borrowed, that A&s;&s;embly may &s;top where they are, and di&s;continue proceeding with the loan, or make new propo&s;itions and terms for the remainder; but &s;o far as the &s;ub&s;criptions have been filled up, and the terms complied with, it is, as in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, a &s;igned deed: and in the &s;ame manner are all Acts, let the matters in them be what they may, wherein, as I have before mentioned, the State on one part, and certain individuals on the other part, are parties in the Act.</P>
<P>If the State &s;hould become a bankrupt, the creditors, as in all ca&s;es of bankruptcy, will be &s;ufferers; they will have but a dividend for the whole: but this is not a di&s;|&s;olution of the contract, but an accommodation of it, ari&s;ing from nece&s;&s;ity. And &s;o in all ca&s;es of Acts of this kind, if an inability takes place on either &s;ide, the contract cannot be performed, and &s;ome accommodation mu&s;t be gone into or the matter falls thro' of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT may likewi&s;e happen, tho' it ought not to happen, that in performing the matters, agreeably to the terms of the Act, inconveniencies, unfore&s;een at the time of making the Act, may ari&s;e to either or both parties: in this ca&s;e, tho&s;e inconveniencies may be removed by the mutual con&s;ent and agreement of the parties, and each find its benefit in &s;o doing: for in a Republic it is the harmony of its parts that con&s;titutes their &s;everal and mutual Good.</P>
<P>BUT the Acts them&s;elves are legally binding, as much as if they had been made between two private individuals. The greatne&s;s of one party cannot give it a &s;uperiority of advantage over the other. The State, or its repre&s;enta|tives the A&s;&s;embly, has no more power over an Act of this kind, after it is pa&s;&s;ed, than if the State was a private per&s;on. It is the glory of a Republic to have it &s;o, be|cau&s;e it &s;ecures the individual from becoming the prey of power, and prevents MIGHT overcoming RIGHT.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="19">IF any difference or di&s;pute ari&s;e afterwards between the State and the individuals with whom the agreement is made, re&s;pecting the contract, or the meaning, or ex|tent of any of the matters contained in the Act, which may affect the property or intere&s;t of either, &s;uch dif|ference or di&s;pute mu&s;t be judged of, and decided upon, by the laws of the land, in a court of ju&s;tice and trial by jury; that is, by the laws of the land already in being at the time &s;uch Act and contract was made.&mdash;No law made afterwards can apply to the ca&s;e, either directly, or by con&s;truction or implication: For &s;uch a law would be a retro&s;pective law, or a law made after the fact, and cannot even be produced in court as applying to the ca&s;e before it for judgment.</P>
<P>THAT this is ju&s;tice, that it is the true principle of republican government, no man will be &s;o hardy as to deny:&mdash;If, therefore, a lawful contract or agreement, &s;ealed and ratified, cannot be affected or altered by any Act made afterwards, how much more incon&s;i&s;tend and irrational, de&s;potic and unju&s;t would it be, to think of making an Act with the profe&s;&s;ed intention of breaking up a contract already &s;igned and &s;ealed.</P>
<P>THAT it is po&s;&s;ible an A&s;&s;embly, in the heat and in|di&s;cretion of party, and meditating on power rather than on the principle by which all power in a republican go|vernment is governed, that of equal ju&s;tice, may fall into the error of pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch an Act, is admitted;&mdash;but it would be an actle&s;s Act, an Act that goes for nothing, an Act which the courts of ju&s;tice, and the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of the land, could know nothing of.</P>
<P>BECAUSE &s;uch an Act would be an Act of one party only, not only without, but again&s;t the con&s;ent of the other; and, therefore, cannot be produced to affect a contract made between the two.&mdash;That the violation of a contract &s;hould be &s;et up as a ju&s;tification to the violator, would be the &s;ame thing as to &s;ay, that a man by breaking his promi&s;e is freed from the obligation of it, or that by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the laws he exempts him&s;elf from the pu|ni&s;hment of them.</P>
<P>BESIDES the con&s;titutional and legal rea&s;ons why an A&s;&s;embly cannot, of its own Act and authority, undo or make void a contract made between the State, (by a former A&s;&s;embly,) and certain individuals, may be added, what may be called, the natural rea&s;ons, or tho&s;e rea&s;ons
<PB N="15" REF="20">which the plain rules of common &s;en&s;e point out to every man. Among which are the following.</P>
<P>THE Principals, or real parties, in the contract, are the State and the per&s;ons contracted with. The A&s;&s;embly is not a party, but an Agent in behalf of the State, au|thori&s;ed and empowered to tran&s;act its affairs.</P>
<P>THEREFORE it is the State that is bound on one part and certain individuals on the other part, and the per|formance of the contract, according to the conditions of it, devolves on &s;ucceeding A&s;&s;emblies, not as Princi|pals, but as Agents.</P>
<P>THEREFORE for the next or any other A&s;&s;embly to undertake to di&s;&s;olve the State from its obligation is an a&s;&s;umption of power of a novel and extraordinary kind&mdash; It is the Servant attempting to free his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>THE election of new A&s;&s;emblies following each other makes no difference in the nature of the thing. The State is &s;till the &s;ame State.&mdash;The public is &s;till the &s;ame body. The&s;e do not annually expire though the time of an A&s;&s;embly does. The&s;e are not new-created every year, nor can they be di&s;placed from their original &s;tand|ing; but are a perpetual permanent body, always in being and &s;till the &s;ame.</P>
<P>BUT if we adopt the vague incon&s;i&s;tent idea that every new A&s;&s;embly has a full and complete authority over every Act done by the State in a former A&s;&s;embly, and con|found together laws, contracts and every &s;pecies of pu|blic bu&s;ine&s;s, it will lead us into a wilderne&s;s of endle&s;s confu&s;ion and un&s;urmountable difficulties. It would be declaring an A&s;&s;embly de&s;potic for the time being.&mdash; In&s;tead of a government of e&s;tabli&s;hed principles admini|&s;tered by e&s;tabli&s;hed rules, the authority of Government by being &s;trained &s;o high, would, by the &s;ame rule, be reduced proportionably as low, and would be no other than that of a Committee of the State acting with di&s;cre|tionary powers for one year. Every new election would be a new revolution, or it would &s;uppo&s;e the public of the former year dead and a new public ri&s;en in its place.</P>
<P>HAVING now endeavoured to fix a preci&s;e idea to, and di&s;tingui&s;h between, Legi&s;lative Acts and Acts of Negociation and Agency, I &s;hall proceed to apply this di&s;tinction to the ca&s;e now in di&s;pute, re&s;pecting the charter of the Bank.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="21">THE charter of the Bank, or what is the &s;ame thing, the Act for incorporating it, is to all intents and purpo&s;es an Act of Negociation and Contract, entered into, and confirmed, between the State on one part, and certain per&s;ons mentioned therein on the other part. The pur|po&s;e for which the Act was done on the part of the State is therein recited, viz. the &s;upport which the finances of the country would derive therefrom. The incorporating clau&s;e is the condition or obligation on the part of the State; and the obligation on the part of the Bank, is, <Q>that nothing contained in that Act &s;hall be con&s;trued to authori&s;e the &s;aid Corporation to exerci&s;e any powers in this State repugnant to the laws or con&s;titution thereof.</Q></P>
<P>HERE are all the marks and evidences of a Contract. The Parties&mdash;the Purport&mdash;and the reciprocal Ob|ligations.</P>
<P>THAT it is a Contract, or a joint Act, is evident from its being in the power of either of the parties to have for|bidden or prevented its being done. The State could not force the &s;tockholders of the Bank to be a corporation, and there|fore as their con&s;ent was nece&s;&s;ary to the making the Act, their di&s;&s;ent would have prevented its being made; &s;o on the other hand, as the Bank could not force the State to in|corporate them, the con&s;ent or di&s;&s;ent of the State would have had the &s;ame effect to <HI>do,</HI> or to prevent its being done; and as neither of theparties could make the Act alone, for the &s;ame rea&s;on can neither of them di&s;&s;olve it alone: But this is not the ca&s;e with a law or Act of legi&s;lation, and therefore the difference proves it to be an Act of a dif|ferent kind.</P>
<P>THE Bank may forfeit the charter by delinquency, but the delinquency mu&s;t be proved and e&s;tabli&s;hed by a legal proce&s;s in a court of ju&s;tice and trial by jury: for the State, or the A&s;&s;embly, is not to be a judge in its own ca&s;e, but mu&s;t come to the laws of the land for judg|ment; for that which is law for the individual, is like|wi&s;e law for the State.</P>
<P>BEFORE I enter farther into this affair, I &s;hall go back to the circum&s;tances of the country and the condition the Government was in, for &s;ome time before, as well as at the time it entered into this engagement with the Bank, and this Act of incorporation was pa&s;&s;ed: for the Go|vernment of this State, and I &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame of the re&s;t,
<PB N="17" REF="22">were then in want of two of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential matters which governments could be de&s;titute of.&mdash;Money and Credit.&mdash;</P>
<P>IN looking back to tho&s;e times, and bringing forward &s;ome of the circum&s;tances attending them, I feel my&s;elf entering on unplea&s;ant and di&s;agreeable ground; becau&s;e &s;ome of the matters which the attack on the Bank now make nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate, in order to bring the affair fully before the Public, will not add honor to tho&s;e who have pro|moted that mea&s;ure, and carried it through the late Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly; and for whom, tho' my own judgment and opinion on the ca&s;e oblige me to differ from, I retain my e&s;teem, and the &s;ocial remembrance of times pa&s;t. But, I tru&s;t, tho&s;e Gentlemen will do me the ju&s;tice to recollect my exceeding earne&s;tne&s;s with them, la&s;t &s;pring, when the attack on the Bank fir&s;t broke out; for it clearly appeared to me one of tho&s;e overheated mea&s;ures, which, neither the country at large, nor their own con|&s;tituents, would ju&s;tify them in when it came to be fully and clearly under&s;tood; for however high a party-mea|&s;ure may be carried in an A&s;&s;embly, the people out of doors are all the while following their &s;everal occupations and employments, minding their farms and their bu&s;ine&s;s, and take their own time and lei&s;ure to judge of public mea&s;ures; the con&s;equence of which is that they often judge in a cooler &s;pirit than their repre&s;entatives act in.</P>
<P>IT may be ea&s;ily recollected that the pre&s;ent Bank was preceded by, and ro&s;e out, of a former one, called the Penn&s;ylvania Bank, which began a few months before; the occa&s;ion of which I &s;hall briefly &s;tate.</P>
<P>IN the &s;pring 1780, the Penn&s;ylvania A&s;&s;embly was compo&s;ed of many of the &s;ame Members, and nearly all of the &s;ame connection, which compo&s;ed the late Hou&s;e that began the attack on the Bank. I &s;erved as Clerk of the A&s;&s;embly of 1780, which &s;tation I re&s;igned at the end of the year and accompanied a much lamented friend the late Colonel John Laurens on an emba&s;&s;y to France.</P>
<P>THE &s;pring of 1780 was marked with an accumulation of misfortunes. The reliance placed on the defence of Charle&s;town failed and exceedingly lowered or rather de|pre&s;&s;ed the &s;pirits of the country. The mea&s;ures of Go|vernment, from the want of money, means and credit, dragged on like a heavy loaded carriage without wheels,
<PB N="18" REF="23">and were nearly got to what a countryman would under|&s;tand by a dead pull.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;embly of that year met by adjournment at an unu&s;ual time, the tenth of May, and what particularly added to the affliction, was, that &s;o many of the Mem|bers, in&s;tead of &s;piriting up their con&s;tituents to the mo&s;t nervous exertions, came to the A&s;&s;embly furni&s;hed with petitions to be exempt from paying taxes. How the pu|blic mea&s;ures were to be carried on, the country defended, and the army recruited, clothed, fed, and paid, when the only re&s;ource, and that not half &s;ufficient, that of taxes, &s;hould be relaxed to almo&s;t nothing, was a matter too gloomy to look at. A language very different from that of petitions ought at this time to have been the language of every one. A declaration to have &s;tood forth with their lives and fortunes, and a reprobation of every thought of partial indulgence would have &s;ounded much better than petitions.</P>
<P>WHILE the A&s;&s;embly was &s;itting a letter from the Commander in chief was received by the Executive Council and tran&s;mitted to the Hou&s;e. The doors were &s;hut and it fell officially to me to read.</P>
<P>IN this letter the naked truth of things was un&s;olded. Among other informations the General &s;aid, that not|with&s;tanding his confidence in the attachment of the army to the cau&s;e of the country, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of it, from the want of every nece&s;&s;ary which men could be de&s;titute of, were ari&s;en to &s;uch a pitch, that the appear|ance of mutiny and di&s;content were &s;o &s;trongly marked on the countenance of the army that he dreaded the event of every hour.</P>
<P>WHEN the letter was read I ob&s;erved a de&s;pairing &s;i|lence in the Hou&s;e. No body &s;poke for a con&s;iderable time. At length a Member of who&s;e fortitude to with|&s;tand misfortunes I had a high opinion, ro&s;e: <Q>If,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>the account in that letter is a true &s;tate of things; and we are in the &s;ituation there repre&s;ented, it appears to me in vain to contend the matter any longer. We may as well give up at fir&s;t as at la&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>THE Gentleman who &s;poke next, was (to the be&s;t of my recollection) a Member from Bucks county, who, in a cheerful note, endeavoured to di&s;&s;ipate the gloom of the Hou&s;e &mdash; "Well, well," &s;aid he, <Q>don't let the Hou&s;e de&s;pair, if things are not &s;o well as we
<PB N="19" REF="24">wi&s;h, we mu&s;t endeavour to make them better.</Q> And on a motion for adjournment, the conver&s;ation went no farther.</P>
<P>THERE was now no time to lo&s;e, and &s;omething ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be done, which was not within the immediate power of the Hou&s;e to do: for what with the depreciation of the Currency, the &s;low operation of taxes, and the petitions to be exempt therefrom, the trea&s;ury was moneyle&s;s, and the Government creditle&s;s.</P>
<P>IF the A&s;&s;embly could not give the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e immediately required, it was very proper the matter &s;hould be known by tho&s;e who either could or would endeavour to do it. To conceal the information within the Hou&s;e, and not provide the relief which that information required, was making no u&s;e of the knowledge and endangering the Public Cau&s;e, The only thing that now remained, and was capable of reaching the ca&s;e, was private credit, and the voluntary aid of individuals; and under this impre&s;&s;ion, on my re|turn from the Hou&s;e, I drew out the &s;alary due to me as Clerk, enclo&s;ed five hundred dollars in a letter to a Gentleman in this City, in part of the whole, and wrote fully to him on the &s;ubject of our affairs.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman to whom this letter was addre&s;&s;ed is Mr. Blair M'Clenaghan. I mentioned to him, that notwith&s;tanding the current opinion that the enemy were beaten from before Charle&s;town, there were too many rea&s;ons to believe the place was then taken and in the hands of the enemy; the con&s;equence of which would be, that a great part of the Briti&s;h force would return, and join that at New-York. That our own army required to be augmented, ten thou&s;and men, to be able to &s;tand again&s;t the combined force of the enemy. I in|formed Mr. M'Clenaghan of General Wa&s;hington's letter, the extreme di&s;tre&s;&s;es he was &s;urrounded with, and the ab&s;olute occa&s;ion there was for the citizens to exert them&s;elves at this time, which there was no doubt they would do, if the nece&s;&s;ity was made known to them; for that the ability of Government was exhau&s;ted. I re|que&s;ted Mr. M'Clenaghan, to propo&s;e a voluntary &s;ub|&s;cription among his friends, and added, that I had en|clo&s;ed five hundred dollars as my mite thereto, and that
<PB N="20" REF="25">I would encrea&s;e it as far as the la&s;t ability would enable me to go.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. M'Clenaghan being now returned from Europe, has my con&s;ent to &s;hew the letter to any Gentleman who may be inclined to &s;ee it.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE next day Mr. M'Clenaghan informed me, he had communicated the contents of the letter at a meeting of Gentlemen at the Coffee-hou&s;e, and that a &s;ub&s;cription was immediately began&mdash;that Mr. Robert Morris and him&s;elf had &s;ub&s;cribed two hundred pounds each, in hard money, and that the &s;ub&s;cription was going very &s;ucce&s;s|fully on.&mdash;This &s;ub&s;cription was intended as a donation, and to be given in bounties to promote the recruiting &s;ervice. It is dated June 8th, 1780. The original &s;ub|&s;cription li&s;t is now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;it amounts to four hundred pounds hard money, and one hundred and one thou&s;and three hundred and &s;ixty pounds continental.</P>
<P>WHILE this &s;ub&s;cription was going forward, infor|mation of the lo&s;s of Charle&s;town arrived,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Col. Tennant, Aid to General Lincoln, arrived the 14th of June, with de&s;patches of the capitulation of Charle&s;town.</NOTE> and on a com|munication from &s;everal Members of Congre&s;s to certain Gentlemen of this city, of the encrea&s;ing di&s;tre&s;&s;es and dangers then taking place, a meeting was held of the &s;ub&s;cribers, and &s;uch other Gentlemen who cho&s;e to at|tend, at the City Tavern. This meeting was on the 17th of June, nine days after the &s;ub&s;criptions had began.</P>
<P>AT this meeting it was re&s;olved to open a &s;ecurity &s;ub&s;cription, to the amount of three hundred thou&s;and pounds, Penn&s;ylvania currency, in real money; the &s;ub|&s;cribers to execute bonds to the amount of their &s;ub&s;crip|tions, and to form a Bank thereon for &s;upplying the army. This being re&s;olved on and carried into execu|tion the plan of the fir&s;t &s;ub&s;criptions was di&s;continued, and this extended one e&s;tabli&s;hed in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>BY means of this Bank the army was &s;upplied thro' the campaign, and being at the &s;ame time recruited, was enabled to maintain its ground: And on the appointment of Mr. Morris to be Superintendant of the finances the &s;pring following, he arranged the &s;y&s;tem of the pre&s;ent Bank, &s;tiled the Bank of North-America, and many of the &s;ub|&s;cribers of the former Bank transferred their &s;ub&s;criptions into this.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="26">TOWARDS the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this Bank, Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed an ordinance of incorporation December 21&s;t 1781, which the Government of Penn&s;ylvania recognized by &s;undry matters: And afterwards, on an application from the Pre&s;ident and Directors of the Bank, thro' the medi|ation of the Executive Council, the A&s;&s;embly agreed to, and pa&s;&s;ed the State Act of Incorporation April 1&s;t 1782.</P>
<P>THUS aro&s;e the Bank&mdash;produced by the di&s;tre&s;s of the times and the enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of patriotic individu|als.&mdash;Tho&s;e individuals furni&s;hed and ri&s;ked the money, and the aid which the Government contributed was that of incorporating them.&mdash;It would have been well if the State had made all its bargains and contracts with as much true policy as it made this; for a greater &s;ervice for &s;o &s;mall a con&s;ideration, that only of an Act of incorpora|tion, has not been obtained &s;ince the Government ex|i&s;ted.</P>
<P>HAVING now &s;hewn how the Bank originated, I &s;hall proceed with my remarks.</P>
<P>THE &s;udden re&s;toration of public and private credit, which took place on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Bank is an event as extraordinary in it&s;elf as any dome&s;tic occurrence during the progre&s;s of the Revolution.</P>
<P>HOW far a &s;pirit of envy might operate to produce the attack on the Bank during the &s;itting of the late A&s;&s;embly, is be&s;t known and felt by tho&s;e who began or promoted that attack. The Bank had rendered &s;ervices which the A&s;&s;embly of 1780 could not, and acquired an honor which many of its Members might be unwilling to own, and wi&s;h to ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>BUT &s;urely every wi&s;e Government acting on the prin|ciples of patrioti&s;m and Public Good would cheri&s;h an In&s;titution capable of rendering &s;uch advantages to the Community. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Bank in one of the mo&s;t trying vici&s;&s;itudes of the war, its zealous &s;er|vices in the public cau&s;e, its influence in re&s;toring and &s;upporting credit, and the punctuality with which all its bu&s;ine&s;s has been tran&s;acted, are matters, that &s;o far from meriting the treatment it met with from the late A&s;&s;em|bly, are an honor to the State, and what the body of her citizens may be proud to own.</P>
<P>BUT the attack on the Bank, as a Chartered In&s;titu|tion, under the protection of its violators, however cri|minal it may be as an error of Government, or impolitic
<PB N="22" REF="27">as a mea&s;ure of party, is not to be charged on the con|&s;tituents of tho&s;e who made the attack. It appears from every circum&s;tance that has come to light to be a mea&s;ure which that A&s;&s;embly contrived of it&s;elf. The Members did not come charged with the affair from their con&s;ti|tuents. There was no idea of &s;uch a thing when they were elected or when they met. The ha&s;ty and precipi|tate manner in which it was hurried through the Hou&s;e, and the refu&s;al of the Hou&s;e to hear the Directors of the Bank in its defence, prior to the publication of the repealing Bill for public con&s;ideration, operated to prevent their con&s;ti|tuents comprehending the &s;ubject: Therefore, whatever may be wrong in the proceedings lies not at the door of the Public. The Hou&s;e took the affair on its own &s;houl|ders, and whatever blame there is lies on them.</P>
<P>THE matter mu&s;t have been prejudged and predeter|mined by a majority of the Members out of the Hou&s;e, before it was brought into it. The whole bu&s;ine&s;s ap|pears to have been fixed at once, and all rea&s;oning or de|bate on the ca&s;e rendered u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>PETITIONS from a very <HI>incon&s;iderable</HI> number of per|&s;ons &s;uddenly procured, and &s;o privately done, as to be a &s;ecret among the few that &s;igned them, were pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e and read twice in one day, and referred to a Committee of the Hou&s;e to <HI>inquire</HI> and report thereon. I here &s;ubjoin the Petition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Minutes of the A&s;&s;embly, March 21, 1785.
<P>Petitions from a con&s;iderable number of the inhabitants of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> county were read, repre&s;enting that the bank e&s;tab|li&s;hed at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> has fatal effects upon the Community; that whil&s;t men are enabled, by means of the bank, to re|ceive near three times the rate of common intere&s;t, and at the &s;ame time to receive their money at very &s;hort warning, whenever they have occa&s;ion for it, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for the hu&s;bandman or mechanic to borrow on the former terms of legal intere&s;t and di&s;tant payments of the principal; that the be&s;t &s;ecurity will not enable the per&s;on to borrow; that experience clearly demon&s;trates the mi&s;chievous con&s;equences of this in&s;titution to the fair trader; that impo&s;tors have been enabled to &s;upport them&s;elves in a fictitious credit, by means of a temporary punctuality at the bank, until they have drawn in their hone&s;t neighbours to tru&s;t them with their property, or to pledge their credit' as &s;ureties, and have been &s;inally involved in ruin and di&s;tre&s;s; that they have repeatedly &s;een the &s;topping of di&s;counts at the bank, operate on the trading part of the Community, with a de|gree of violence &s;carcely inferior to that of a &s;tagnation of the blood in the human body, hurrying the wretched mer|chant who hath debts to pay into the hands of griping u&s;ur|ers; that the Directors of the bank may give &s;uch prefe|rence in trade, by advances of money, to their particular favorites, as to de&s;troy that equality which ought to prevail in a commercial country; that paper-money has often proved beneficial to the &s;tate, but the bank forbids it, and the people mu&s;t acquie&s;ce: therefore, and in order to re&s;tore public confidence and private &s;ecurity, they pray that a bill may be brought in and pa&s;&s;ed into a law for repealing the law for incorporating the bank.</P>
<P>March 28.</P>
<P>The report of the committee, read March 25, on the pe|titions from the counties of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Berks,</HI> and the city of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> and its vicinity, praying the act of A&s;&s;embly, whereby the bank was e&s;tabli&s;hed at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> may be re|pealed, was read the &s;econd time as follows, viz.</P>
<P>The committee to whom were referred the petitions con|cerning the bank e&s;tabli&s;hed at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and who were in&s;tructed to inquire whether the &s;aid bank be compatible with the public &s;afety, and that equality which ought ever to prevail between the individuals of a republic, beg leave to report, That it is the opinion of this committee, that the &s;aid bank, as at pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed, is in every view incompatible with the public &s;afety: that in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our trade, the &s;aid bank has a direct tendency to bani&s;h a great part of the &s;pecie from the country, &s;o as to produce a &s;carcity of money, and to collect into the hands of the &s;tockholders of the &s;aid bank almo&s;t the whole of the money which remains among&s;t us. That the accumulation of enormous wealth in the hands of a &s;ociety, who claim perpetual duration, will nece&s;&s;arily produce a degree of influence and power, which cannot be entru&s;ted in the hands of any &s;et of men what&s;o|ever, without endangering the public &s;afety. That the &s;aid bank, in its corporate capacity, is empowered to hold e&s;tates to the amount of ten millions of dollars, and by the tenor of the pre&s;ent charter, is to exi&s;t forever, without being obliged to yield any emolument to the government, or to be at all de|pendent upon it. That the great profits of the bank, which will daily encrea&s;e as money grows &s;carcer, and which already far exceed the profits of European banks, have tempted fo|reigners to ve&s;t their money in this bank, and thus to draw from us large &s;ums for intere&s;t.</P>
<P>That foreigners will doubtle&s;s be more and more induced to become &s;tockholders, until the time may arrive when this enormous engine of power may become &s;ubject to foreign influence; this country may be agitated with the politics of European courts, and the good people of <HI>America</HI> reduced once more into a &s;tate of &s;ubordination, and dependence upon &s;ome one or other of the European powers That at be&s;t, if it were even confined to the hands of Americans, it would be totally de&s;tructive of that equality which ought to prevail in a republic. We have nothing in our free and equal government capable of balancing the influence which this bank mu&s;t create; and we &s;ee nothing which in the cour&s;e of a &s;ew years, can prevent the directors of the bank, from governing Penn&s;ylvania. Already we have felt its influence indirectly interfering in the mea&s;ures of the legi&s;|lature. Already the hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, the repre&s;ent actives of the people have been threatened, that the credit of our paper currency will be bla&s;ted by the bank; and if this growing evil continous, we fear the time is not very di&s;tant, when the bank will be able to dictate to the legi&s;lature, what laws to pa&s;s and what to forbear.</P>
<P>Your committee therefore beg leave further to report the following re&s;olution to be adopted by the hou&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> that a committee be appointed to bring in a bill to repeal the act of A&s;&s;embly, pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t day of <HI>April</HI> 1782, entitled, "<HI>Affect to incorporate the &s;ub&s;cribers to the bank of</HI> North-America;" and al&s;o to repeal one other act of A&s;&s;embly, pa&s;&s;ed the 18th of <HI>March,</HI> 1782, entitled, <Q><HI>An act for preventing and puni&s;hing the counterfeiting of the common &s;eal, bank-bills and bank-notes of the pre&s;ident, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ors and company, of the bank of</HI> North-America, <HI>and for the other purpo&s;es therein mentioned,</HI></Q></P></NOTE> and the Report, and &s;hall
<PB N="23" REF="28">exerci&s;e the right and privilege of a citizen in examining their merits, not for the purpo&s;e of oppo&s;ition, but with a de&s;ign of making an intricate affair more generally and better under&s;tood.</P>
<P>So far as my private judgment is capable of com|prehending the &s;ubject, it appears to me, that the Committee were unacquainted with, and have totally mi&s;taken, the nature and bu&s;ine&s;s of a Bank, as well as the matter committed to them, con&s;idered as a proceed|ing of Government.</P>
<P>THEY were in&s;tructed by the Hou&s;e to <HI>inquire</HI> whether the Bank e&s;tabli&s;hed at Philadelphia was compatible with the public &s;afety.</P>
<P>IT is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e the in&s;tructions meant no more than that they were to inquire of one another. It is certain they made no inquiry at the Bank, to inform them&s;elves of the &s;ituation of its affairs, how they were conducted, what aids it had rendered the public cau&s;e, or whether any; nor do the Committee produce in their report a &s;ingle fact or circum&s;tance to &s;hew they made any inquiry at all, or whether the rumors then circulated were true or fal&s;e; but content them&s;elves with modelling the in&s;inuations of the petitions into a report and giving an opinion thereon.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="29">IT would appear from the report, that the Committee either conceived that the Hou&s;e had already determined how it would act without regard to the ca&s;e, and that they were only a Committee for form &s;ake, and to give a co|lor of inquiry without making any, or that the ca&s;e was referred to them, <HI>as law-que&s;tions are &s;ometimes re&s;erred to law-officers, for an opinion only.</HI></P>
<P>THIS method of doing public bu&s;ine&s;s &s;erves exceed|ingly to mi&s;lead 2 country.&mdash;When the con&s;tituents of an A&s;&s;embly hear that an enquiry into any matter is di|rected to be made, and a Committee appointed for that purpo&s;e, they naturally conclude that the inquiry <HI>is made,</HI> and that the future proceedings of the Hou&s;e are in con|&s;equence of the matters, facts, and information obtained by
<PB N="25" REF="30">means of that inquiry.&mdash;But here is a Committee of inquiry making no inquiry at all, and giving an opinion on a ca&s;e without inquiring into it. This proceeding of the Committee would ju&s;tify an opinion that it was not their wi&s;h to <HI>get,</HI> but to <HI>get over</HI> information, and le&s;t the enquiry &s;hould not &s;uit their wi&s;hes, omitted to make any. The &s;ub&s;equent conduct of the Hou&s;e, in re&s;olving not to hear the Directors of the Bank on their application for that purpo&s;e, prior to the publication of the Bill for the con&s;ideration of the people, &s;trongly corroborates this opinion: For why &s;hould not the Hou&s;e hear them, unle&s;s it was apprehen&s;ive, that the Bank, by &s;uch a public opportunity, would produce proofs of its &s;ervices and u&s;efulne&s;s, that would not &s;uit the temper and views of its oppo&s;ers?</P>
<P>BUT if the Hou&s;e did not wi&s;h or chu&s;e to hear the de|fence of the Bank, it was no rea&s;on their con&s;tituents &s;hould not. The Con&s;titution of this State, in lieu of having two branches of Legi&s;lature, has &s;ub&s;tituted, that <Q>To the end that laws before they are enacted may be more <HI>maturely con&s;idered,</HI> and the inconvenience of <HI>ha&s;ty determinations</HI> as much as po&s;&s;ible prevented, all Bills of a public nature &s;hall be printed for the con&s;i|deration
<PB N="26" REF="31">deration of the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Con&s;titution, &s;ection the 15th.</NOTE>.</Q>&mdash; The people, therefore, according to the Con&s;titution, &s;tand in the place of ano|ther Hou&s;e; or, more properly &s;peaking, are a Hou&s;e in their own right.&mdash;But in this in&s;tance the A&s;&s;embly arrogates the whole power to it&s;elf, and places it&s;elf as a bar to &s;top the nece&s;&s;ary information &s;preading among the people.&mdash;The application of the Bank to be heard before the Bill was publi&s;hed for public con&s;idera|tion had two objects.&mdash;Fir&s;t, to the Hou&s;e,&mdash;and &s;econdly, thro' the Hou&s;e to the people, who are as ano|ther Hou&s;e. It was as a defence in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and as an appeal in the &s;econd. But the A&s;&s;embly ab|&s;orbs the right of the people to judge; becau&s;e, by re|fu&s;ing to hear the de&s;ence, they barred the appeal.&mdash; Were there no other cau&s;e which the con&s;tituents of that A&s;&s;embly had for cen&s;uring its conduct, than the exceed|ing unmirne&s;s, partiality, and arbitrarine&s;s with which this bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted, it would be cau&s;e &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>LET the con&s;tituents of A&s;&s;emblies differ, as they may, re&s;pecting certain peculiarities in the <HI>form</HI> of the Con&s;titution, they will all agree in &s;upporting its <HI>principles,</HI> and in reprobating unfair proceedings and de&s;potic mea&s;ures. Every con&s;tituent is a member of the Republic, which is a &s;tation of more con&s;equence to him than being a member of a party, and tho' they may differ from each other in their choice of per&s;ons to tran&s;act the public bu&s;ine&s;s, it is of equal importance to
<PB N="27" REF="32">all parties that the bu&s;ine&s;s be done on right principles: otherwi&s;e our laws and Acts, in&s;tead of being founded in ju&s;tice, will be founded in party, and be laws and Acts of retaliation; and in&s;tead of being a Republic of free citizens, we &s;hall be alternately tyrants and &s;laves. &mdash;But to return to the Report.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE Report begins by &s;tating that, <Q>The Commit|tee to whom were referred the petitions concerning the Bank e&s;tabli&s;hed at Philadelphia, and who were in|&s;tructed to <HI>inquire</HI> whether the &s;aid Bank be com|patible with the public &s;afety, and that equality which ought ever to prevail between the individuals of a Republic, beg leave to report,</Q> (not that they have made any <HI>inquiry,</HI> but) <Q>That it is the <HI>opinion</HI> of this Committee, that the &s;aid Bank, as at pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed, is, in every view, incompatible with the public &s;afety.</Q>&mdash;But why is it &s;o? Here is an opinion unfounded and unwarranted. The Committee have began their Report at the wrong end; for an opinion, when given as a matter of judgment, is an action of the mind which follows a fact, but here it is put in the room of one.</P>
<P>THE Report then &s;ays, <Q>That in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our trade the &s;aid Bank has a direct tendency to bani&s;h a great part of the &s;pecie from the country, and to collect into the hands of the &s;tockholders of the Bank almo&s;t the whole of the money which remains among us.</Q></P>
<P>HERE is another mere a&s;&s;ertion, ju&s;t like the former, without a &s;ingle fact or circum&s;tance to &s;hew why it is made or whereon it is founded.&mdash;Now the very re|ver&s;e, of what the Committee a&s;&s;erts, is the natural con|&s;equence of a Bank.&mdash;Specie may be called the &s;tock in trade of the Bank, it is therefore its intere&s;t to pre|vent it from wandering out of the country, and to keep a con&s;tant &s;tanding &s;upply to be ready for all dome&s;tic occa&s;ions and demands. Were it true that the Bank has a direct tendency to bani&s;h the &s;pecie from the country, there would &s;oon be an end to the Bank; and, therefore, the Committee have &s;o far mi&s;taken the mat|ter, as to put their fears in the place of their wi&s;hes for if it is to happen as the Committee &s;tates, let the Bank alone and it will cea&s;e of it&s;elf, and the repealing Act need not have been pa&s;&s;ed.</P>

IT is the intere&s;t of the Bank that people &s;hould keep their ca&s;h there, and all commercial countries find the ex|ceeding great convenience of having a general repo&s;itory for their ca&s;h. &mdash; But &s;o far from bani&s;hing it, there are no two cla&s;&s;es of people in America who are &s;o much in|tere&s;ted in pre&s;erving hard money in the country as the Bank and the Merchant. Neither of them can carry on their bu&s;ine&s;s without it. Their oppo&s;ition to the paper-money of the late A&s;&s;embly was becau&s;e it has a direct effect, as far as it is able, to bani&s;h the &s;pecie and that without providing any means for bringing more in. The Committee mu&s;t have been aware of this, and therefore cho&s;e to &s;pread the fir&s;t alarm, and groundle&s;s as it was to tru&s;t to the delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>As the keeping the &s;pecie in the country is the intere&s;t of the Bank, &s;o it has the be&s;t opportunities of preventing its being &s;ent away, and the earlie&s;t knowledge of &s;uch a de&s;ign. While the Bank is the general repo&s;itory of ca&s;h no great &s;ums can be obtained without getting it from thence, and as it is evidently prejudicial to its intere&s;t to advance money to be &s;ent abroad, becau&s;e in this ca&s;h, the money can not by circulation return again, the Bank, therefore, is intere&s;ted in preventing what the Committee would have it &s;u&s;pected of promoting.</P>
<P>IT is to prevent the exportation of ca&s;h and to retain it in the country that the Bank has on &s;everal occa&s;ions &s;topt the di&s;counting notes till the danger has been pa&s;&s;ed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The petitions &s;ay "That they have repeatedly &s;een the &s;topping of di&s;counts at the bank, operate on the trading part of the Community, with a degree of violence &s;carcely inferior to that of a &s;tagnation of the blood in the human body, harrying the wretched merchant who hath debts to pay into the hands of griping u&s;urers."
<P>As the per&s;ons who &s;ay or &s;igned this live &s;omewhere in Che&s;ter county, they are not, from &s;ituation, certain of what they &s;ay. Tho&s;e petitions have every appearance of being contrived for the purpo&s;e of bringing the matter on. The petition and the report have &s;trong evidence in them of being both drawn up by the &s;ame per&s;on: for the report is as clearly the echo of the petition as ever the addre&s;s of the Briti&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> was the echo of the King's &s;peech.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the rea&s;on I have already given for occa&s;ionally &s;topping di&s;counting notes at the bank, there are other ne|ce&s;&s;ary rea&s;ons. It is for the purpo&s;e of &s;ettling accounts. Short reckonings make long friends. The bank lends its money for &s;hort periods, and by that means a&s;&s;i&s;ts a great many different people: and if it did not &s;ometimes &s;top di&s;|counting as a means of &s;ettling with the per&s;ons it has al|ready lent its money to, tho&s;e per&s;ons would find a way to keep what they had borrowed longer than they ought, and prevent others being a&s;&s;i&s;ted. It is a fact, and &s;ome of the Committee know it to be &s;o, that &s;undry of tho&s;e per&s;ons who then oppo&s;ed the Bank acted this part.</P>
<P>The &s;topping the di&s;counts do not, and cannot, operate to call in the loans &s;ooner than the time for which they were lent, and therefore the charge is fal&s;e that "it hurries men into the hands of griping u&s;urers":&mdash;and the truth is, that it operates to keep them from thence.</P>
<P>If petitions are to be contrived to cover the de&s;igns of a hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly and give a pretence for its conduct. or if a hou&s;e is to be led by the no&s;e by the idle tale of any fifty or &s;ixty &s;igners to a petition, it is time for the public to look a little clo&s;er into the conduct of its repre&s;entatives.</P></NOTE> The fir&s;t part, therefore, of the a&s;&s;ertion, that
<PB N="29" REF="36">of bani&s;hing the &s;pecie, contains an apprehen&s;ion as need|le&s;s as it is groundle&s;s, and which, had the Committee under&s;tood, or been the lea&s;t informed of the nature of a Bank, they could not have made. It is very probable that &s;ome of the oppo&s;ers to the Bank are tho&s;e per&s;ons who have been di&s;appointed in their attempt to obtain &s;pecie for this purpo&s;e and now cloak their oppo&s;ition under other pretences.</P>
<P>I now come to the &s;econd part of the a&s;&s;ertion, which is that when the Bank has bani&s;hed a great part of the &s;pecie from the country, "it will collect into the hands of "the &s;tockholders almo&s;t the whole of the money which "remains among us."&mdash;But how, or by what means, the Bank is to accompli&s;h this wonderful feat the Commit|tee have not informed us. Whether people are to give their money to the Bank for nothing, or whether the Bank is to charm it from them as a rattle&s;nake charms a &s;quirrel from a tree, the Committee have left us as much in the dark about as they were them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible the Committee &s;hould know &s;o very little of the matter, as not to know that no part of the money
<PB N="30" REF="37">which at any time may be in the Bank belongs to the &s;tockholders; not even the original capital which they put in is any part of it their own until every per&s;on who has a demand upon the Bank is paid, and if there is not a &s;ufficiency for this purpo&s;e on the balance of lo&s;s and gain, the original money of the &s;tockholders mu&s;t make up the deficiency.</P>
<P>THE money which at any time may be in the Bank is the property of every man who holds a Bank-note, or depo&s;its ca&s;h there, or who has a ju&s;t demand upon it from the city of Philadelphia up to fort Pitt, or to any part of the United States; and he can draw the money from it when he plea&s;es. Its being in the Bank, does not in the lea&s;t make it the property of the &s;tockholders, any more than the money in the State Trea&s;ury is the property of the State Trea&s;urer. They are only &s;te|wards over it for tho&s;e who plea&s;e to put it, or let it re|main there: and, therefore, this &s;econd part of the a&s;&s;er|tion is &s;omewhat ridiculous.</P>
<P>THE next paragraph in the Report is, <Q>That the ac|cumulation of <HI>enormous wealth</HI> in the hands of a <HI>&s;ociety</HI> who claim perpetual duration will nece&s;&s;arily produce a degree of influence and power which cannot be en|tru&s;ted in the hands of any &s;et of men what&s;oever</Q> (the Committee I pre&s;ume excepted) <Q>without endan|gering the public &s;afety.</Q>&mdash;There is an air of &s;o|lemn fear in this paragraph which is &s;omewhat like in|troducing a gho&s;t in a play to keep people from laughing at the players.</P>
<P>I HAVE already &s;hewn that whatever wealth there may be, at any time, in the Bank, is the property of tho&s;e who have demands upon the Bank, and not the property of the &s;tockholders. As a Society they hold no property, and mo&s;t probably never will, unle&s;s it &s;hould be a hou&s;e to tran&s;act their bu&s;ine&s;s in, in&s;tead of hiring one. Every half year the Bank &s;ettles its ac|counts and each individual &s;tockholder takes his dividend of gain or lo&s;s to him&s;elf, and the Bank begins the next halfyear in the &s;ame manner it began the fir&s;t, and &s;o on. This being the nature of a Bank, there can be no accu|mulation of wealth among them as a &s;ociety.</P>
<P>FOR what purpo&s;e the word <HI>"&s;ociety"</HI> is introduced into the Report I do not know, unle&s;s it be to make a fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ion on people's minds. It has no connection
<PB N="31" REF="38">with the &s;ubject, for the Bank is not a &s;ociety, but a company, and denominated &s;o in the Charter. There are &s;everal religious &s;ocieties incorporated in this State, which hold property as the right of tho&s;e &s;ocieties, and to which no per&s;on can belong that is not of the &s;ame religious profe&s;&s;ion. But this is not the ca&s;e with the Bank. The Bank is a company for the promotion and convenience of commerce, which is a matter in which all the State is intere&s;ted, and holds no property in the manner which tho&s;e &s;ocieties do.</P>
<P>BUT there is a direct contradiction in this paragraph to that which goes before it. The Committee, there, accu&s;es the Bank of bani&s;hing the &s;pecie, and here, of accumulating enormous &s;ums of it.&mdash;So here are two enormous &s;ums of &s;pecie; one enormous &s;um going out, and another enormous &s;um remaining.&mdash;To reconcile this contradiction, the Committee &s;hould have added to their Report, <HI>that they &s;u&s;pected the Bank had found out the Philo&s;opher's &s;tone, and kept it a &s;ecret.</HI></P>
<P>THE next paragraph is, <Q>That the &s;aid Bank, in its corporate capacity, is empowered to hold e&s;tates to the amount of ten millions of dollars, and by the tenor of the pre&s;ent Charter is to exi&s;t for ever, without being obliged to yield any emolument to the Government, or be at lea&s;t dependent on it.</Q></P>
<P>THE Committee have gone &s;o vehemently into this bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o completely &s;hewn their want of know|ledge in every point of it, as to make, in the fir&s;t part of this paragraph, a fear of what, the greater fear is, will never happen. Had the Committee known any|thing of Banking, they mu&s;t have known, that the ob|jection again&s;t Banks has been, (not that they held great e&s;tates, but) that they held none; that they had no real, fixed, and vi&s;ible property, and that it is the maxim and practice of Banks not to hold any.</P>
<P>THE Honorable Chancellor Living&s;ton, late Secre|tary for foreign affairs, did me the honor of &s;hewing, and di&s;cour&s;ing with me on, a plan of a Bank he had drawn up for the State of New-York. In this plan it was made a condition or obligation, that whatever the capital of the Bank amounted to in &s;pecie, there &s;hould be added twice as much in real e&s;tates. But the mer|cantile intere&s;t rejected the propo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="39">IT was a very good piece of policy in the A&s;&s;embly which pa&s;&s;ed the Charter Act, to add the Clau&s;e to im|power the Bank to purcha&s;e and hold real e&s;tates. It was as an inducement to the Bank to do it, becau&s;e &s;uch e&s;tates being held as the property of the Bank would be &s;o many mortgages to the Public in addition to the mo|ney capital of the Bank.</P>
<P>BUT the doubt is that the Bank will not be induced to accept the opportunity. The Bank has exi&s;ted five years and has not purcha&s;ed a &s;hilling of real property: and as &s;uch property or e&s;tates can not be purcha&s;ed by the Bank but with the intere&s;t money which the &s;tock produces, and as that is divided every half year among the &s;tockholders, and each &s;tockholder chu&s;es to have the management of his own dividend, and if he lays it out in purcha&s;ing an e&s;tate to have that e&s;tate his own private property, and under his own immediate manage|ment, there is no expectation, &s;o far from being any fear, that the Clau&s;e will be accepted.</P>
<P>WHERE knowledge is a duty, ignorance is a crime; and the Committee are criminal in not under&s;tanding this &s;ubject better. Had this Clau&s;e not been in the Charter, the Committee might have rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rted the want of it as a defect, in not empowering the Bank to hold e&s;tates as a real &s;ecurity to its creditors: but as the com|plaint now &s;tands, the accu&s;ation of it is, that the Charter empowers the Bank to <HI>give real &s;ecurity</HI> to as creditors. A complaint never made, heard of, or thought of before.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd article in this paragraph is, <Q>That the Bank according to the tenor of the pre&s;ent Charter is to exi&s;t for ever</Q>&mdash;Here I agree with the Com|mittee, and am glad to find that among &s;uch a li&s;t of er|rors and contradictions there is one idea which is not wrong, altho' the Committee have made a wrong u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>As we are not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ive for ever our&s;elves, and other ge|nerations are to follow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, we have neither the power nor the right to govern them, or to &s;ay how they &s;hall govern them&s;elves. It is the &s;ummit of human vanity, and &s;hews a covetou&s;ne&s;s of power beyond the grave, to be dictating to the world to come. It is &s;ufficient that we do that which is right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n our own day and leave them with the advantage of good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mples.</P>
<P>As the generations o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the world are every day both
<PB N="33" REF="40">commencing and expiring, therefore, when any public Act of this &s;ort is done it naturally &s;uppo&s;es the age of that generation to be then beginning, and the time con|tained between coming of age, and the natural end of life, in the extent of time it has a right to go to, which may be about thirty years; for tho' many may die before, others will live beyond; and the mean time is equally &s;air for all generations.</P>
<P>IF it was made an article in the Con&s;titution, that all laws and Acts &s;hould cea&s;e of them&s;elves in thirty years, and have no legal force beyond that time, it would pre|vent their becoming too numerous and voluminous, and &s;erve to keep them within view and in a compact com|pa&s;s. Such as were proper to be continued, would be enacted again, and tho&s;e which were not, would go in|to oblivion. There is the &s;ame propriety that a nation &s;hould fix a time for a full &s;ettlement of its affairs, and begin again from a new date, as that an individual &s;hould, and to keep within the di&s;tance of thirty years would be a convenient period.</P>
<P>THE Briti&s;h, from the want of &s;ome general regulation of this kind, have a great number of ob&s;olete laws; which, tho' out of u&s;e and forgot, are not out of force, and are occa&s;ionally brought up for &s;harping pur|po&s;es, and innocent unwary per&s;ons trepanned thereby.</P>
<P>To extend this idea &s;till further,&mdash;it would probably be a con&s;iderable improvement in the political &s;y&s;tem of nations, to make all treaties of peace for a limited time. It is the nature of the mind to feel unea&s;y under the idea of a condition perpetually exi&s;ting over it, and to excite in it&s;elf apprehen&s;ions that would not take place were it not from that cau&s;e.</P>
<P>WERE treaties of peace made for, and renewable every, &s;even or ten years, the natural effect would be, to make peace continue longer than it does under the cu&s;tom of making peace for ever. If the parties felt or appre|hended any inconveniencies under the terms already made, they would look forward to the time when they &s;hould be eventually relieved therefrom, and might re|new the treaty on improved conditions. This opportu|nity periodically occurring, and the recollection of it always exi&s;ting, would &s;erve as a chimney to the political fabric, to carry off the &s;moke and fume of national fire.
<PB N="34" REF="41">It would naturally abate, and honorably take off, the edge and occa&s;ion for fighting; and however the parties might determine to do it, when the time of the treaty &s;hould expire, it would then &s;eem like fighting in cool blood: The fighting temper would be di&s;&s;ipated before the fighting time arrived, and negociation &s;upply its place. To know how probable this may be, a man need do no more than ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of his own mind on any private circum&s;tance &s;imilar in its nature to a public one. &mdash;But to return to my &s;ubject&mdash;</P>
<P>To give Limitation is to give Duration: and tho' it is not a ju&s;tifying rea&s;on, that becau&s;e an Act or Con|tract is not to la&s;t for ever, that it &s;hall be broken or violated to day, yet, where no time is mentioned, the omi&s;&s;ion affords an opportunity for the abu&s;e. When we violate a contract on this pretence, we a&s;&s;ume a right that belongs to the next generation; for tho' they, as a following generation, have the right of altering or &s;etting it a&s;ide, as not being concerned in the making it, or not being done in their day, we, who made it, have not that right; and, therefore, the Committee, in this part of their report, have made a wrong u&s;e of a right principle; and as this Clau&s;e in the Charter might have been altered by the con&s;ent of the parties, it cannot be produced to ju&s;tify the violation.&mdash;And were it not altered there would be no inconvenience from it. The term "for ever" is an ab&s;urdity that would have no effect. The next age will think for it&s;elf by the &s;ame rule of right that we have done, and not admit any a&s;&s;umed authority of ours to en|croach upon the &s;y&s;tem of their day. Our <HI>for ever</HI> ends where their <HI>for ever</HI> begins.</P>
<P>THE third article in this paragraph is, that the Bank holds its Charter <Q>without being obliged to yield any emolument to the Government.</Q></P>
<P>INGRATITUDE has a &s;hort memory. It was on the failure of the Government, to &s;upport the Public Cau&s;e, that the Bank originated. It &s;tept in as a &s;upport when &s;ome of the per&s;ons then in the Government, and who now oppo&s;e the Bank, were apparently on the point of abandoning the cau&s;e, not from di&s;affection, but from de&s;pair. While the expences of the war were carried on by emi&s;&s;ions of continental money, any &s;et of men, in Government, might carry it on. The means being provided to their hands, required no great exertions of
<PB N="35" REF="42">fortitude or wi&s;dom: but when this means failed, they would have failed with it, had not a public &s;pirit awakened it&s;elf with energy out of doors. It was ea&s;y times to the Governments while continental money la&s;ted. The dream of wealth &s;upplied the reality of it; but when the dream vani&s;hed, the Government did not awake.</P>
<P>BUT what right has the Government to expect any emolument from the Bank? Does the Committee mean to &s;et up Acts and Charters for &s;ale, or what do they mean? Becau&s;e it is the practice of the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try to grind a toll out of every public in&s;titution they can get a power over, is the &s;ame practice to be followed here?</P>
<P>THE war being now ended, and the Bank having rendered the &s;ervice expected, or rather hoped for, from it, the principal public u&s;e of it, at this time, is for the promotion and exten&s;ion of commerce. The whole community derives benefit from the operation of the Bank. It facilitates the commerce of the country. It quickens the means of purcha&s;ing and paying for coun|try-produce, and ha&s;tens on the exportation of it. The emolument, therefore, being to the Community, it is the office and duty of Government to give protection to the Bank.</P>
<P>AMONG many of the principal conveniencies ari&s;ing from the Bank, one of them is, that it gives a kind of life to, what would otherwi&s;e be, dead money, Every merchant and per&s;on in trade, has always in his hands &s;ome quantity of ca&s;h, which con&s;tantly remains with him; that is, he is never entirely without: This rem|nant money, as it may be called, is of no u&s;e to him till more is collected to it. He can neither buy produce nor merchandize with it, and this being the ca&s;e with every per&s;on in trade, there will be (tho' not all at the &s;ame) as many of tho&s;e &s;ums lying u&s;ele&s;sly by, and &s;cattered throughout the city, as there are per&s;ons in trade, be&s;ides many that are not in trade.</P>
<P>I SHOULD not &s;uppo&s;e the e&s;timation overrated, in conjecturing, that half the money in the city, at any one time, lies in this manner. By collecting tho&s;e &s;cattered &s;ums together, which is done by means of the Bank, they become capable of being u&s;ed, and the quan|tity of circulating ca&s;h is doubled, and by the depo&s;itors
<PB N="36" REF="43">alternately lending them to each other, the commercial &s;y&s;tem is invigorated; and as it is the intere&s;t of the Bank to pre&s;erve this money in the country for dome&s;tic u&s;es only, and as it has the be&s;t opportunity of doing &s;o, the Bank &s;erves as a &s;entinel over the &s;pecie.</P>
<P>IF a farmer, or a miller, comes to the city with pro|duce, there are but few merchants that can individually purcha&s;e it with ready money of their own; and tho&s;e few would command nearly the whole market for coun|try produce: But, by means of the Bank, this monopoly is prevented, and the chance of the market enlarged. It is very extraordinary that the late A&s;&s;embly &s;hould promote monopolizing; yet &s;uch would be the effect of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Bank; and it is much to the honor of tho&s;e merchants, who are capable, by their fortunes, of be|coming monopolizers, that they &s;upport the Bank. In this ca&s;e, honor operates over intere&s;t. They were the per&s;ons who fir&s;t &s;et up the Bank, and their honor is now engaged to &s;upport what it is their intere&s;t to put down.</P>
<P>IF merchants, by this means, or farmers, by &s;imilar means, among them&s;elves, can mutually aid and &s;upport each other, what has the Government to do with it? What right has it to expect emolument from a&s;&s;ociated indu&s;try, more than from individual indu&s;try? It would be a &s;trange &s;ort of a Government, that &s;hould make it illegal for people to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, or pay a tribute for doing &s;o.</P>
<P>BUT the truth is, that the Government has already derived emoluments, and very extraordinary ones. It has already received its full &s;hare, by the &s;ervices of the Bank during the war; and it is every day receiving benefits, becau&s;e whatever promotes and facilitates com|merce, &s;erves likewi&s;e to promote and facilitate the revenue.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t article in this paragraph is. <Q>That the Bank is not the lea&s;t dependent on the Government.</Q></P>
<P>HAVE the Committee &s;o &s;oon forgot the principles of Republican Government and the Con&s;titution, or are &s;o little acquainted with them, as not to know, that this article in their Report partakes of the nature of trea&s;on? Do they not know, that freedom is de&s;troyed by de|pendence, and the &s;afety of the State endangered there|by? Do they not &s;ee, that to hold any part of the
<PB N="37" REF="44">citizens of the State, as yearly pen&s;ioners on the favor of an A&s;&s;embly, is &s;triking at the root of free elections? If other parts of their Report di&s;cover a want of know|ledge on the &s;ubject of Banks, this &s;hews a want of principle in the &s;cience of Government.</P>
<P>ONLY let us &s;uppo&s;e this dangerous idea carried into practice, and then &s;ee what it leads to. If corporate Bodies are, after their incorporation, to be annually de|pendent on an A&s;&s;embly for the continuance of their Charter, the citizens, which compo&s;e tho&s;e corpora|tions, are not free. The Government holds an au|thority and influence over them, in a manner different from what it does over other citizens, and by this means de&s;troys that equality of freedom, which is the bulwark of the Republic and the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>BY this &s;cheme of Government any party, which happens to be uppermo&s;t in a State, will command all the corporations in it, and may create more for the pur|po&s;e of extending that influence. The dependent Bo|rough-Towns in England are the rotten part of their Government, and this idea of the Committee has a very near relation to it.</P>
<P>"If you do not do &s;o and &s;o," expre&s;&s;ing what was meant, "take care of your Charter," was a threat thrown out again&s;t the Bank. But as I do not wi&s;h to enlarge on a di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance, and hope that what is already &s;aid, is &s;ufficient to &s;hew the Anti-Con|&s;titutional conduct and principles of the Committee, I &s;hall pa&s;s on to the next paragraph in the Report.&mdash; Which is&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>THAT the great profits of the Bank, which will daily encrea&s;e as money grows &s;carcer, and which already far exceed the profits of European Banks, have tempted foreigners to ve&s;t their money in this Bank, and thus to draw from us large &s;ums for intere&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>HAD the Committee under&s;tood the &s;ubject, &s;ome dependence might be put on their opinion which now cannot. Whether money will grow &s;carcer, and whe|ther the profits of the Bank will increa&s;e, are more than the Committee know, or are judges &s;ufficient to gue&s;s at. The Committee are not &s;o capable of taking care of commerce, as commerce is capable of taking care of it&s;elf. The farmer under&s;tands farming, and the
<PB N="38" REF="45">merchant under&s;tands commerce; and as riches are equally the object of both, there is no occa&s;ion that either &s;hould fear that the other will &s;eek to be poor, The more money the merchant has, &s;o much the better for the farmer, who has produce to &s;ell: and the richer the farmer is, &s;o much the better for the merchant, when he comes to his &s;tore.</P>
<P>As to the profits of the Bank, the &s;tockholders mu&s;t take their chance for it. It may &s;ome years be more and others le&s;s, and upon the whole may not be &s;o productive as many other ways that money may be employed. It is the convenience which the &s;tockholders, as commercial men, derive from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Bank, and not the mere intere&s;t they receive, that is the inducement to them. It is the ready opportunity of borrowing alter|nately of each other that forms the principal object: And as they pay as well as receive a great part of the intere&s;t among them&s;elves, it is nearly the &s;ame thing, both ca&s;es con&s;idered at once, whether it is more or le&s;s.</P>
<P>THE &s;tockholders are occa&s;ionally depo&s;itors and &s;ome|times borrowers of the Bank. They pay intere&s;t for what they borrow, and receive none for what they de|po&s;it; and were a &s;tockholder to keep a nice account of the intere&s;t he pays for the one and lo&s;es upon the other, he would find, at the year's end, that ten per cent upon his &s;tock would probably not be more than common in|tere&s;t upon the whole, if &s;o much.</P>
<P>As to the Committee complaining <Q>that foreigners by ve&s;ting their money in the Bank will draw large &s;ums from us for intere&s;t,</Q> it is like a miller complaining in a dry &s;ea&s;on, that &s;o much water runs into his Dam that &s;ome of it runs over.</P>
<P>COULD tho&s;e foreigners draw this intere&s;t without put|ting in any capital the complaint would be well founded; but as they mu&s;t fir&s;t put money in before they can draw any out, and as they mu&s;t draw many years before they can draw even the numerical &s;um they put in at fir&s;t, the effect, for at lea&s;t twenty years to come, will be directly contrary to what the Committee &s;tates: Becau&s;e we draw <HI>capitals</HI> from them and they only <HI>intere&s;t</HI> from us, and as we &s;hall have the u&s;e of the money all the while it remains with us, the advantage will always be in our favor.&mdash; In framing this part of the Report, the Committee mu&s;t have forgot which &s;ide of the Atlantic they were on, for the
<PB N="39" REF="46">ca&s;e would be as they &s;tate it if we put money into their Bank in&s;tead of they putting it into ours.</P>
<P>I HAVE now gone thro', line by line, every objection again&s;t the Bank, contained in the fir&s;t half of the Report; what follows may be called, <HI>The Lamentations of the Com|mittee,</HI> and a lamentable pu&s;illanimous degrading affair it is&mdash; It is a public affront, a reflection upon the &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of the whole country. I &s;hall give the remainder together as it &s;tands in the Report, and then my remarks.</P>
<P>THE Lamentations are <Q>That foreigners will doubt|le&s;s le&s;s be more and more induced to become &s;tockholders, until the time may arrive when this <HI>enormous</HI> engine of power may become &s;ubject to foreign influence, this country may be agitated by the politics of European Courts, and the good people of America reduced once more into a &s;tate of &s;ubordination and dependence upon &s;ome one or other of the European Powers. That at be&s;t, if it were even confined to the hands of Ameri|cans, it would be totally de&s;tructive of that equality which ought to prevail in a Republic. We have no|thing in our free and equal Government capable of ba|lancing the influence which this Bank mu&s;t create; and we &s;ee nothing which in the cour&s;e of a few years can prevent the Directors of the Bank from governing Pen&s;ylvania. Already we have felt its influence indi|rectly interfering in the mea&s;ures of the Legi&s;lature. Already the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, the repre&s;entatives of the people, have been threatened, that the credit of our paper currency will be bla&s;ted by the Bank; and if this growing evil continues, we fear the time is not very di&s;tant when the Bank will be able to dictate to the Legi&s;lature, what laws to pa&s;s and what to forbear.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN the &s;ky falls we &s;hall be all killed. There is &s;omething &s;o ridiculou&s;ly grave, &s;o wide of probability, and &s;o wild, confu&s;ed and incon&s;i&s;tent in the whole com|po&s;ition of this long paragraph that I am at a lo&s;s how to begin upon it.&mdash;It is like a drowning man crying fire! fire!</P>
<P>THIS part of the Report is made up of two dreadful predictions. The fir&s;t is, that if foreigners purcha&s;e Bank &s;tock we &s;hall be all ruined:&mdash;The &s;econd is, that if the Americans keep the Bank to them&s;elves we &s;hall be al&s;o ruined.</P>
<P>A COMMITTEE of fortune-tellers is a novelty in Go|vernment;
<PB N="40" REF="47">and the Gentlemen by giving this &s;pecimen of their art, have ingeniou&s;ly &s;aved their honor on one point, which is, that tho' people may &s;ay they are not Bankers, nobody can &s;ay they are not Conjurers.&mdash; There is, however, one con&s;olation left, which is, that the Committee do not know <HI>exactly</HI> how long it may be; &s;o there is &s;ome hope that we may all be in heaven when this dreadful calamity happens upon earth.</P>
<P>BUT to be &s;erious, if any &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary on &s;o laughable a &s;ubject.&mdash;If the &s;tate &s;hould think there is any thing improper in foreigners purcha&s;ing Bank &s;tock, or any other kind of &s;tock or funded property, (for I &s;ee no rea&s;on why Bank &s;tock &s;hould be particu|larly pointed at) the Legi&s;lature have authority to prohi|bit it. It is a mere political opinion that has nothing to do with the Charter or the Charter with that; and therefore the fir&s;t dreadful prediction vani&s;hes.</P>
<P>IT has always been a maxim in politics founded on, and drawn from, natural cau&s;es and con&s;equences, that the more foreign countries which any nation can intere&s;t in the pro&s;perity of its own &s;o much the better. Where the trea&s;ure is there will the heart be al&s;o; and therefore when foreigners ve&s;t their money with us, they naturally inve&s;t their good wi&s;hes with it, and it is we that obtain an influence over them, not they over us.&mdash;But the Committee &s;at out &s;o very wrong at fir&s;t that the further they travelled the more they were out of their way; and now they are got to the end of their Report they are at the utmo&s;t di&s;tance from their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd dreadful part, that of the Bank overturning the Government, perhaps the Committee meant that at the next general election them&s;elves might be turned out of it, which has partly been the ca&s;e; not by the influence of the Bank, for it had none, not even enough to obtain the permi&s;&s;ion of a hearing from Government, but by the influence of rea&s;on and the choice of the people, who mo&s;t probably re&s;ent the un|due and uncon&s;titutional influence which that Hou&s;e and the Committee were a&s;&s;uming over the privileges of citi|zen&s;hip.</P>
<P>THE Committee might have been &s;o mode&s;t as to have confined them&s;elves to the Bank, and not thrown a general odium on the whole country. Before the events can happen which the Committee predict,
<PB N="41" REF="48">the electors of Penn&s;ylvania mu&s;t become dupes, dunces and cowards, and therefore when the Committee predict the dominion of the Bank they predict the di&s;grace of the people.</P>
<P>THE Committee having fini&s;hed their Report proceed to give their advice, which is,</P>
<P><Q>That a Committee be appointed to bring in a bill to repeal the Act of A&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t day of April 1782, entitled, <HI>"An Act to incorporate the &s;ub|&s;cribers to the Bank of North-America,"</HI> and al&s;o to re|peal one other Act of the A&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed the 18th of March 1782, entitled, <HI>"An Act for preventing and pu|ni&s;hing the counterfeiting of the common &s;eal, Bank bills, and Bank notes of the Pre&s;ident, Directors and Company of the Bank of North-America, and for other purpo&s;es therein mentioned.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THERE is &s;omething in this &s;equel to the Report that is perplexed and ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>HERE are two Acts to be repealed. One is, the in|corporating Act.&mdash;The other, the Act for preventing and puni&s;hing the counterfeiting of the common &s;eal, Bank bills, and Bank notes of the Pre&s;ident, Directors and Company of the Bank of North-America.</P>
<P>IT would appear from the Committee's manner of ar|ranging them, (were it not for the difference of their dates) that the Act for puni&s;hing the counterfeiting the common &s;eal, &amp;c. of the Bank, followed the Act of in|corporation, and that the common &s;eal there referred to is a common &s;eal which the Bank held in con&s;equence of the afore&s;aid incorporating Act.&mdash;But the ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e. The Act for puni&s;hing the counterfeiting the common &s;eal, &amp;c. the Bank, was pa&s;&s;ed prior to the incorporating Act, and refers to the common &s;eal which the Bank held in con&s;equence of the Charter of Congre&s;s, and the &s;tile which the Act expre&s;&s;es, of Pre&s;ident, Direc|tors and Company of the Bank of North-America, is the corporate &s;tile which the Bank derives under the Con|gre&s;s Charter.</P>
<P>THE puni&s;hing Act, therefore, hath two di&s;tinct legal points. The one is, an authoritative public recognition of the Charter of Congre&s;s. The &s;econd is, the puni&s;h|ment it inflicts on counterfeiting.</P>
<P>THE Legi&s;lature may repeal the puni&s;hing part but it cannot undo the recognition, becau&s;e no repealing Act
<PB N="42" REF="49">can &s;ay that the State <HI>has not</HI> recognized. The recogni|tion is a mere matter of fact, and no law or Act can un|do a fact or put it, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, in the conditi|on it was before it exi&s;ted. The repealing Act therefore does not reach the full point the Committee had in view; for even admitting it to be a repeal of the State Charter, it &s;till leaves another Charter recognized in its &s;tead.&mdash; The Charter of Congre&s;s, &s;tanding merely on it&s;elf, would have a doubtful authority, but the recognition of it by the State gives it legal ability. The repealing Act, it is true, &s;ets a&s;ide the puni&s;hment but does not bar the operation of the Charter of Congre&s;s as a Charter recog|nized by the State, and therefore the Committee did their bu&s;ine&s;s but by halves.</P>
<P>I HAVE now gone entirely through the Report of the Committee, and a more irrational incon&s;i&s;tent contradic|tory Report will &s;carcely be found on the journals of any Legi&s;lature in America.</P>
<P>HOW the repealing Act is to be applied, or in what manner it is to operate, is a matter yet to be determined. For admitting a que&s;tion of law to ari&s;e, whether the Charter, which that Act attempts to repeal, is a law of the land in the manner which laws of univer&s;al operation are, or of the nature of a contract made between the Pub|lic and the Bank (as I have already explained in this work) the repealing Act does not and cannot decide the que&s;tion, becau&s;e it is the repealing Act that makes the que&s;tion, and its own fate is involved in the deci&s;ion. It is a que&s;tion of law and not a que&s;tion of legi&s;lation, and mu&s;t be decided on in a court of ju&s;tice and not by a Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>BUT the repealing Act by being pa&s;&s;ed prior to the de|ci&s;ion of this point a&s;&s;umes the power of deciding it, and the A&s;&s;embly in &s;o doing erects it&s;elf uncon&s;titutionally into a tribunal of judicature, and ab&s;orbs the authority and right of the courts of ju&s;tice into it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THEREFORE the operation of the repealing Act, in its very out&s;et, requires inju&s;tice to be done. For it is impo&s;&s;ible on the principles of a republican government and the Con&s;titution, to pa&s;s an Act to forbid any of the citizens the right of appealing to the courts of ju&s;tice on any matter in which his intere&s;t or property is affected; but the fir&s;t operation of this Act goes to &s;hut up the courts of ju&s;tice, and holds them &s;ub&s;ervient to the A&s;|&s;embly
<PB N="43" REF="50">It either commands or influences them not to hear the ca&s;e, or to give judgment on it on the mere will of one party only.</P>
<P>I WISH the citizens to awaken them&s;elves on this &s;ubject.&mdash;Not becau&s;e the Bank is concerned, but becau&s;e their own con&s;titutional rights and privileges are involved in the event. It is a que&s;tion of exceeding great mag|nitude; for if an A&s;&s;embly is to have this power the laws of the land and the courts of ju&s;tice are but of little u&s;e.</P>
<P>HAVING now fini&s;hed with the Report, I proceed to the third and la&s;t &s;ubject&mdash;that of Paper-Money.&mdash;</P>
<P>I REMEMBER a German farmer expre&s;&s;ing as much in a few words as the whole &s;ubject requires: <Q><HI>Money is Money and Paper is Paper.</HI></Q>&mdash;All the invention of man cannot make them otherwi&s;e. The alchymi&s;t may cea&s;e his labours, and the hunter after the philo&s;opher's &s;tone go to re&s;t, if paper can be metamorpho&s;ed into gold and &s;ilver, or made to an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e in all ca&s;es.</P>
<P>GOLD and &s;ilver are the emi&s;&s;ions of nature; paper is the emi&s;&s;ion of art. The value of gold and &s;ilver is a&s;certained by the quantity which nature has made in the earth. We cannot make that quantity more or le&s;s than it is, and therefore the value being dependent upon the quantity, depends not on man.&mdash;Man has no &s;hare in making gold or &s;ilver; all that his labours and ingenuity can accompli&s;h is, to collect it from the mine, refine it for u&s;e and give it an impre&s;&s;ion, or &s;tamp it into coin.</P>
<P>ITS being &s;tamped into coin adds con&s;iderably to its convenience but nothing to its value. It has then no more value than it had before. Its value is not in the impre&s;&s;ion but in it&s;elf. Take away the impre&s;&s;ion and &s;till the &s;ame value remains. Alter it as you will, or ex|po&s;e it to any misfortune that can happen, &s;till the value is not dimini&s;hed. It has a capacity to re&s;i&s;t the acci|dents that de&s;troy other things. It has, therefore, all the requi&s;ite qualities that money can have, and is a fit ma|terial to make money of; and nothing, which has not all tho&s;e properties, can be fit for the purpo&s;e of money.</P>
<P>PAPER, con&s;idered as a material whereof to make money, has none of the requi&s;ite qualities in it. It is too plentiful, and too ea&s;ily come at. It can be had any where, and for a trifle.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="51">THERE are two ways in which I &s;hall con&s;ider paper.</P>
<P>THE only proper u&s;e for paper, in the room of money, is to write promi&s;&s;ory notes and obligations of payment in &s;pecie upon. A piece of paper, thus written and &s;igned, is worth the &s;um it is given for, if the per&s;on who gives it is able to pay it; becau&s;e, in this ca&s;e, the law will oblige him. But if he is worth nothing, the paper-note is worth nothing. The value, therefor&eacute;, of &s;uch a note, is not in the note it&s;elf, for that is but pa|per and promi&s;e, but in the man who is obliged to re|deem it with gold or &s;ilver.</P>
<P>PAPER, circulating in this manner, and for this pur|po&s;e, continually points to the place and per&s;on where, and of whom, the money is to be had, and at la&s;t finds its home; and, as it were, unlocks its ma&s;ter's che&s;t and pays the bearer.</P>
<P>BUT when an A&s;&s;embly undertake to i&s;&s;ue paper <HI>as</HI> money, the whole &s;y&s;tem of &s;afety and certainty is over|turned, and property &s;et afloat. Paper-notes given and taken between individuals as a promi&s;e of payment is one thing, but paper i&s;&s;ued by an A&s;&s;embly <HI>as</HI> money is ano|ther thing. It is like putting an apparition in the place of a man; it vani&s;hes with looking at and nothing re|mains but the air.</P>
<P>MONEY, when con&s;idered as the fruit of many years indu&s;try, as the reward of labour, &s;weat and toil, as the widow's dowry and the childrens portion, and as the means of procuring the nece&s;&s;aries, and alleviating the af|flictions of life, and making old age a &s;cene of re&s;t, has &s;omething in it &s;acred that is not to be &s;ported with, or tru&s;ted to the airy bubble of paper-currency.</P>
<P>BY what power or authority an A&s;&s;embly undertake to make paper-money is difficult to &s;ay. It derives none from the Con&s;titution, for that is &s;ilent on the &s;ubject. It is one of tho&s;e things which the people have not dele|gated, and which, were they at any time a&s;&s;embled toge|ther, they would not delegate. It is, therefore, an a&s;|&s;umption of power which an A&s;&s;embly is not warranted in, and which may, one day or other, be the means of bringing &s;ome of them to puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>I SHALL enumerate &s;ome of the evils of paper-money and conclude with offering means for preventing them.</P>
<P>ONE of the evils of paper-money is, that it turns the
<PB N="45" REF="52">whole country into &s;tock-jobbers. The precariou&s;ne&s;s of its value and the uncertainty of its fate continually ope|rate, night and day, to produce this de&s;tructive effect. Having no real value in it&s;elf it depends for &s;upport upon accident, caprice and party, and as it is the intere&s;t of &s;ome to depreciate and of others to rai&s;e its value, there is a continual invention going on that de&s;troys the mo|rals of the country.</P>
<P>IT was horrid to &s;ee and hurtful to recollect how loo&s;e the principles of ju&s;tice were let by means of the paper|emi&s;&s;ions during the war. The experience then had &s;hould be a warning to any A&s;&s;embly how they venture to open &s;uch a dangerous door again.</P>
<P>As to the romantic if not hypocritical tale, that a vir|tuous people need no gold and &s;ilver and that paper will do as well, requires no other contradiction than the ex|perience we have &s;een. Though &s;ome well-meaning people may be inclined to view it in this light, it is certain that the &s;harper always talks this language.</P>
<P>THERE are a &s;et of men who go about making pur|cha&s;es upon credit, and buying e&s;tates they have not wherewithal to pay for; and having done this, their next &s;tep is to fill the news-papers with paragraphs of the &s;car|city of money and the nece&s;&s;ity of a paper-emi&s;&s;ion, then to have it made a legal tender under the pretence of &s;up|porting its credit; and when out, to depreciate it as fa&s;t as they can, get a deal of it for a little price and cheat their creditors; and this is the conci&s;e hi&s;tory of Paper-money &s;chemes.</P>
<P>BUT why &s;ince the univer&s;al cu&s;tom of the world has e&s;tabli&s;hed money as the mo&s;t convenient medium of traf|fic and commerce, &s;hould paper be &s;et up in preference to gold and &s;ilver? The productions of nature are &s;urely as innocent as tho&s;e of art; and in the ca&s;e of money, are abundantly, if not infinitely, more &s;o. The love of gold and &s;ilver may produce covetou&s;ne&s;s, but covetou&s;ne&s;s, when not connected with di&s;hone&s;ty, is not properly a vice. It is frugality run to an extreme.</P>
<P>BUT the evils of paper-money have no end. Its un|certain and fluctuating value is continually awakening or creating new &s;chemes of deceit. Every principle of ju&s;tice is put to the rack and the bond of &s;ociety di&s;&s;olved: The &s;uppre&s;&s;ion therefore of paper-money might very properly have been put into the Act for preventing Vice and Im|morality.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="53">THE pretence for paper-money has been, that there was not a &s;ufficiency of gold and &s;ilver. This, &s;o far from being a rea&s;on for paper-emi&s;&s;ions, is a rea&s;on again&s;t them.</P>
<P>As gold and &s;ilver are not the productions of North-America, they are, therefore, articles of importation; and if we &s;et up a paper-manufactory of money, it amounts, as far as it is able, to prevent the importation of Hard money, or to &s;end it out again as fa&s;t as it comes in; and by following this practice we &s;hall continually bani&s;h the &s;pecie, till we have none left, and be continually com|plaining of the grievance in&s;tead of remedying the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING gold and &s;ilver as articles of importa|tion, there will in time, unle&s;s we prevent it by paper-emi&s;&s;ions, be as much in the country as the occa&s;ions of it require, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons there are as much of other imported articles. But as every yard of cloth manufac|tured in the country occa&s;ions a yard the le&s;s to be im|ported, &s;o it is by money, with this difference, that in the one ca&s;e we manufacture the thing it&s;elf and in the other we do not. We have cloth for cloth, but we have only paper-dollars for &s;ilver ones.</P>
<P>As to the a&s;&s;umed authority of any A&s;&s;embly in making paper-money, or paper of any kind, a legal tender, or in other language, a compul&s;ive payment, it is a mo&s;t pre|&s;umptuous attempt at arbitrary power. There can be no &s;uch power in a Republican government: The people have no freedom, and property no &s;ecurity where this practice and be acted: And the Committee who &s;hall bring in a report for this purpo&s;e, or the Member who moves for it, and he who &s;econds it merit impeachment, and &s;ooner or later may expect it.</P>
<P>OF all the various &s;orts of ba&s;e coin, paper-money is the ba&s;e&s;t. It has the lea&s;t intrin&s;ic value of any thing that can be put in the place of gold and &s;ilver. A hob|nail or a piece of wampum far exceeds it. And there would be more propriety in making tho&s;e articles a legal tender than to make paper &s;o.</P>
<P>IT was the i&s;&s;uing ba&s;e coin and e&s;tabli&s;hing it as a tender, that was one of the principal means of finally overthrowing the power of the Stewart family in Ireland. The article is worth reciting as it bears &s;uch a re&s;em|blance to the progre&s;s practi&s;ed on paper-money.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="54"><Q>Bra&s;s and copper of the ba&s;e&s;t kind, old cannon, broken bells, hou&s;ehold uten&s;ils were a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly col|lected; and from every pound weight of &s;uch vile materials, valued at four-pence, pieces were coined and circulated to the amount of five pounds nominal value. By the fir&s;t proclamation they were made cur|rent in all payments to and from the King and the &s;ubjects of the realm, except in duties on the impor|tation of foreign goods, money left in tru&s;t, or due by mortgage, bills or bonds; and <HI>James</HI> promi&s;ed that when the money &s;hould be decried, he would receive it in all payments or make full &s;atisfaction in gold and &s;ilver. The nominal value was afterwards rai&s;ed by &s;ub&s;equent proclamations, the original re|&s;trictions removed, and this ba&s;e money was ordered to be received in all kinds of payments. As bra&s;s and copper grew &s;carce it was made of &s;till viler ma|terials, of tin and pewter, and old debts of one thou|&s;and pounds were di&s;charged by pieces of vile metal, amounting to thirty &s;hillings in intrin&s;ic value.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Leland's hi&s;tory of Ireland, vol. iv, page 265.</NOTE>&mdash; Had King James thought of paper he needed not to have been at the trouble or expence of collecting bra&s;s and copper, broken bells and hou&s;ehold uten&s;ils.</P>
<P>THE laws of a country ought to be the &s;tandard of equity, and calculated to impre&s;s on the mind of the people the moral as well as the legal obligation of reci|procal ju&s;tice. But tender-laws, of any kind, operate to de&s;troy morality, and to di&s;&s;olve by the pretence of law what ought to be the principle of law to &s;upport, reciprocal ju&s;tice between man and man: And the pu|ni&s;hment of a member who &s;hould move for &s;uch a law ought to be DEATH.</P>
<P>WHEN the recommendation of Congre&s;s in the year 1780 for repealing the tender-laws was before the A&s;|&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania, on ca&s;ting up the votes, for and again&s;t bringing in a bill to repeal tho&s;e laws, the numbers were equal, and the ca&s;ting vote re&s;ted on the Speaker, Colonel Bayard. <Q>I give my vote</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>for the repeal from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of ju&s;tice; the tender-laws operate to e&s;tabli&s;h iniquity by law.</Q>&mdash; But when the Bill was brought in, the Hou&s;e rejected
<PB N="48" REF="55">it, and the tender-laws continued to be the means of fraud.</P>
<P>IF any thing had, or could have, a value equal to gold and &s;ilver it would require no tender-law; and if it had not that value it ought not to have &s;uch a law; and, therefore, all tender-laws are tyrannical and unju&s;t, and calculated to &s;upport fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>MOST of the advocates for tender-laws are tho&s;e who have debts to di&s;charge, and who take refuge in &s;uch a law, to violate their contracts and cheat their creditors. But as no law can warrant the doing an unlawful act, therefore, the proper mode of proceeding, &s;hould any &s;uch laws be enacted in future, will be to impeach and execute the Members who moved for and &s;econded &s;uch a Bill, and put the debtor and the creditor in the &s;ame &s;ituation they were in, with re&s;pect to each other, be|fore &s;uch a law was pa&s;&s;ed. Men ought to be made to tremble at the idea of &s;uch a barefaced act of inju&s;tice. It is in vain to talk of re&s;toring credit, or to complain that money cannot be borrowed at legal intere&s;t, until every idea of tender-laws is totally and publicly repro|bated and extirpated from among us.</P>
<P>As to paper-money, in any light it can be viewed, it is at be&s;t a bubble. Con&s;idered as property it is in|con&s;i&s;tent to &s;uppo&s;e that the breath of an A&s;&s;embly, who&s;e authority expires with the year, can give to paper the value and duration of gold. They cannot even en|gage that the next A&s;&s;embly &s;hall receive it in taxes. And by the precedent (for authority there is none) that any one A&s;&s;embly makes paper-money, another may do the &s;ame, until confidence and credit are totally ex|pelled, and all the evils of depreciation acted over again. The amount, therefore, of Paper-Money is this, That it is the illegitimate offspring of A&s;&s;emblies, and when their year expire they leave it a vagrant on the hands of the Public.</P>
<P>HAVING now gone thro' the three &s;ubjects propo&s;ed in the title to this work, I &s;hall conclude with offering &s;ome thoughts on the pre&s;ent affairs of the State.</P>
<P>MY idea of a &s;ingle Legi&s;lature was always founded on a hope, that whatever per&s;onal parties there might be in the State, they would all unite and agree in the gene|ral principles of good government&mdash;that the&s;e party dif|ferences would be dropt at the thre&s;hold of the &s;tate-hou&s;e,
<PB N="49" REF="56">and that the Public Good or the good of the whole, would be the governing principle of the Legi&s;|lature within it.</P>
<P>PARTY di&s;pute, taken on this ground, would only be, who &s;hould have the honor of making the laws; not what the laws &s;hould be. But when party operates to produce party laws, a &s;ingle Hou&s;e is a &s;ingle per&s;on, and &s;ubject to the ha&s;te, ra&s;hne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion of indivi|dual &s;overeignty. At lea&s;t, it is an ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>THE form of the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution is now made to trample on its principles, and the con&s;titutional Mem|bers are anti-con&s;titutional Legi&s;lators. They are fond of &s;upporting the form for the &s;ake of the power, and they dethrone the principle to di&s;play the &s;ceptre.</P>
<P>THE attack of the late A&s;&s;embly on the Bank di&s;co|vers &s;uch a want of moderation and prudence, of impar|tiality and equity, of fair and candid enquiry and in|ve&s;tigation, of deliberate and unbia&s;&s;ed judgment, and &s;uch a ra&s;hne&s;s of thinking and vengeance of power as is incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the Republic. It was judging without hearing and execution without trial.</P>
<P>BY &s;uch ra&s;h, injudicious and violent proceedings the intere&s;t of the State is weakened, its pro&s;perity dimi|ni&s;hed and its commerce and its &s;pecie bani&s;hed to other places.&mdash;Suppo&s;e the Bank had not been in an imme|diate condition to have &s;tood &s;uch a &s;udden attack, what a &s;cene of in&s;tant di&s;tre&s;s would the ra&s;hne&s;s of that A&s;|&s;embly have brought upon this city and State. The holders of Bank-notes, whoever they might be, would have been thrown into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion and diffi|culties. It is no apology to &s;ay the Hou&s;e never thought of this, for it was their duty to have thought of every thing.</P>
<P>BUT by the prudent and provident management of the Bank (tho' un&s;u&s;picious of the attack) it was ena|bled to &s;tand the run upon it without &s;topping payment a moment, and to prevent the evils and mi&s;chiefs tak|ing place which the ra&s;hne&s;s of the A&s;&s;embly had a di|rect tendency to bring on; a trial that &s;carcely a Bank in Europe, under a &s;imilar circum&s;tance, could have &s;tood through.</P>
<P>I CANNOT &s;ee rea&s;on &s;ufficient to believe that the hope of the Hou&s;e to put down the Bank was placed on the withdrawing the Charter, &s;o much as on the expec|tation
<PB N="50" REF="57">of producing a bankruptey on the Bank, by &s;tarting a run upon it. If this was any part of their project it was a very wicked one, becau&s;e hundreds might have been ruined to gratify a party-&s;pleen.</P>
<P>BUT this not being the ca&s;e, what has the attack amounted to, but to expo&s;e the weakne&s;s, and ra&s;hne&s;s, the want of judgment as well as ju&s;tice, of tho&s;e who made it, and to confirm the credit of the Bank more &s;ub&s;tantially than it was before.</P>
<P>THE attack, it is true, has had one effect, which is not in the power of the A&s;&s;embly to remedy, it has bani&s;h|ed many thou&s;and hard dollars from the &s;tate.&mdash;By the means of the Bank, Penn&s;ylvania had the u&s;e of a great deal of hard money belonging to citizens of other States, and that without any intere&s;t, for it laid here in the na|ture of a depo&s;it, the depo&s;itors taking Bank-notes in its &s;tead. But the alarm called tho&s;e notes in and the owners drew out their ca&s;h.</P>
<P>THE bani&s;hing the &s;pecie &s;erved to make room for the paper-money of the A&s;&s;embly, and we have now paper dollars where we might have had &s;ilver ones. So that the effect of the paper-money has been to make le&s;s money in the &s;tate than there was before. Paper-mo|ney is like dram-drinking, it relieves for the moment by a deceitful &s;en&s;ation, but gradually dimini&s;hes the natu|ral heat, and leaves the body wor&s;e than it found it. Were not this the ca&s;e, and could money be made of pa|per at plea&s;ure, every Sovereign in Europe would be as rich as he plea&s;ed. But the truth is, that it is a bubble and the attempt vanity. Nature has provided the proper materials for money, gold and &s;ilver, and any attempt of ours to rival her is ridiculous.</P>
<P>BUT to conclude&mdash;If the Public will permit the opinion of a friend who is attached to no party, and under obligations to none, nor at variance with any, and who through a long habit of acquaintance with them has never ceceived them, that opinion &s;hall be f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eely given.</P>
<P>THE Bank is an In&s;titution capable of being made exceedingly bene&s;icial to the State, not only as the means of extending and facilitating its commerce, but as a means of increa&s;ing the quantity of hard money in the State. The A&s;&s;embly's paper-money &s;erves directly to bani&s;h or croud out the hard, becau&s;e it is i&s;&s;ued <HI>as</HI> mo|ney and put in the place of hard money. But Bank
<PB N="51" REF="58">notes are of a very different kind, and produce a con|trary effect. They are promi&s;&s;ory notes payable on de|mand, and may be taken to the Bank and exchanged for gold or &s;ilver without the lea&s;t ceremony or difficulty.</P>
<P>THE Bank, therefore, is obliged to keep a con&s;tant &s;tock of hard money &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e; which is what the A&s;&s;embly neither does, nor can do by their pa|per; becau&s;e the quantity of hard money collected by taxes into the Trea&s;ury is tri&s;ling compared with the quantity that circulates in trade and through the Bank.</P>
<P>THE method, therefore, to increa&s;e the quantity of hard money would be to combine the &s;ecurity of the Govern|ment and the Bank into one. And in&s;tead of i&s;&s;uing pa|per-money that &s;erves to bani&s;h the &s;pecie, to borrow the &s;um wanted of the Bank in Bank-notes on the con|dition of the Bank exchanging tho&s;e notes at &s;tated pe|riods and quantities with hard money.</P>
<P>PAPER i&s;&s;ued in this manner, and directed to this end, would, in&s;tead of bani&s;hing, work it&s;elf into, gold and &s;iver; becau&s;e it will then be both the advan|tage and duty of the Bank, and of all the mercantile in|tere&s;t connected with it, to procure and import gold and &s;ilver from any part of the world it can be got, to ex|change the notes with. The Engli&s;h Bank is re&s;tricted to the dealing in no other articles of importation than gold and &s;ilver, and we may make the &s;ame u&s;e of our Bank if we proceed properly with it.</P>
<P>THOSE notes will then have a double &s;ecurity, that of the Government and that of the Bank; and they will not be i&s;&s;ued <HI>as</HI> money, but as ho&s;tages to be exchanged for hard money, and will, therefore, work the contrary way to what the paper of the A&s;&s;embly, uncombined with the &s;ecurity of the Bank, produces: And the in|tere&s;t allowed the Bank will be &s;aved to Government by a &s;aving of the expences and charges attending paper|emi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>IT is, as I have already ob&s;erved in the cour&s;e of this work, the harmony of all the parts of a Republic, that con&s;titutes their &s;everal and mutual good. A Govern|ment, that is con&s;tructed only to govern, is not a Re|publican Government. It is combining authority with u&s;efulne&s;s that in a great mea&s;ure di&s;tingui&s;hes the Republican &s;y&s;tem from others.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="59">PAPER-MONEY appears, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to be a great &s;aving, or rather that it co&s;ts nothing; but it is the dear|e&s;t money there is. The ea&s;e with which it is emitted by an A&s;&s;embly at fir&s;t, &s;erves as a trap to catch people in at la&s;t. It operates as an anticipation of the next year's taxes. If the money depreciates, after it is out, it then, as I have already remarked, has the effect of fluctuating &s;tock, and the people become &s;tock-jobbers to throw the lo&s;s on each other.&mdash;If it does not depreciate, it is then to be &s;unk by taxes at the price of <HI>hard money;</HI> becau&s;e the &s;ame quantity of produce, or goods, that would pro|cure a paper-dollar to pay taxes with would procure a &s;tiver one for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Therefore in any ca&s;e of paper-money it is dearer to the country than hard mo|ney by all the expence which the paper, printing, &s;igning and other attendant charges come to, and at la&s;t goes in|to the fire.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE one hundred thou&s;and dollars in paper-mo|ney to be emitted every year by the A&s;&s;embly, and the &s;ame &s;um to be &s;unk every year by taxes, there will then be no more than one hundred thou&s;and dollars out at any one time. If the expence of paper and printing, and of per&s;ons to attend the pre&s;s while the &s;heets are &s;triking on, &s;igners, &amp;c. be five per cent. it is evident that in the cour&s;e of twenty years emi&s;&s;ions, the one hundred thou&s;and dollars will co&s;t the country two hundred thou|&s;and dollars. Becau&s;e the papermaker's and printer's bills, and the expence of &s;upervi&s;ors and &s;igners, and other attendant charges, will in that time amount to as much as the money amounts to; for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive emi&s;&s;ions are but a recoinage of the &s;ame &s;um.</P>
<P>BUT gold and &s;ilver require to be coined but once, and will la&s;t a hundred years, better than paper will one year, and at the end of that time be &s;till gold and &s;ilver. Therefore the &s;aving to Government, in combining its all and &s;ecurity with that of the Bank in procuring hard money, will be an advantage to both, and to the whole community.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e to be provided again&s;t, after this, will be, that the Government do not borrow too much of the Bank, nor the Bank lend more notes than it can redeem; and, therefore, &s;hould any thing of this kind be under|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> the be&s;t way will be to begin with a moderate &s;um, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> given the Bank
<PB N="53" REF="60">operates as a bounty on the importation of hard money and which may not be more than the money expended i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> making paper-emi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>BUT nothing of this kind, nor any other public under taking, that requires &s;ecurity and duration beyond the year, can be gone upon under the pre&s;ent mode of co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ducting Government. The late A&s;&s;embly, by a&s;&s;umir a &s;overeign power over every Act and matter done by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> State in former A&s;&s;emblies, and thereby &s;etting up a pre cedent of overhauling and overturning, as the accident o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> elections &s;hall happen or party prevail, have rendered Government incompetent to all the great objects of the State. They have eventually reduced the Public to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> annual body like them&s;elves; whereas the Public are &s;tanding permanent body, holding annual elections.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal great improvements and under takings, &s;uch as inland navigation, building bridges opening roads of communication thro' the State, and other matters of a public benefit, that might be gone upon, but which now cannot, until this governmental er|ror or defect is remedied. The faith of Government, under the pre&s;ent mode of conducting it, cannot be relied on. Individuals will not venture their money, in under|takings of this kind, on an Act that may be made by one A&s;&s;embly and broken by another. When a man can &s;ay that he cannot tru&s;t the Government, the im|portance and dignity of the Public is dimini&s;hed, &s;apped and undermined; and, therefore, it becomes the Public to re&s;tore their own honor, by &s;etting the&s;e matters to rights.</P>
<P>PERHAPS this cannot be effectually done until the time of the next Convention, when the principles, on which they are to be regulated and fixed, may be made a part of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Public may keep their affairs in &s;ufficient good order, by &s;ub&s;tituting prudence in the place of authority, and electing men into the Government, who will at once throw a&s;ide the narrow prejudices of party, and make the Good of the Whole the ruling object of their conduct&mdash;And with this hope, and a &s;incere wi&s;h for their pro&s;perity, I clo&s;e my book.</P>
