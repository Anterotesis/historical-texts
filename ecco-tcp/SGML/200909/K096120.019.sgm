<HEAD>A DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF SWITZERLAND, <HI>CONTINUED.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Town and Canton of Friburgh.</HEAD>
<P>THE canton of Friburgh contains a &s;mall portion of arable land, but abounds in pa&s;tures; and, accordingly, its principal articles of exportation con|&s;i&s;t in horned cattle, chee&s;e, butter, and hides.</P>
<P>The chee&s;e well known under the name of Gruyere, which is exported in &s;uch large quantities, is made in a chain of mountains in this canton, about ten leagues in length, and four in breadth. All the chee&s;e, though made in the &s;ame manner, is not of the &s;ame quality; a difference, probably ari&s;ing from the diver&s;ity of the &s;oil; the &s;ame plants not growing at all heights, and the lower pa&s;tures called <HI>gites,</HI> being not in &s;uch high e&s;timation for their goodne&s;s, as tho&s;e in the more elevated &s;itua|tions.</P>
<P>The whole di&s;trict is divided into greater or le&s;&s;er farms, which the proprietors let out in lea&s;es of three
<PB N="2" REF="4">
or &s;ix years, at the annual rent of 16 &s;hillings to 30 &s;hillings, during five months for each cow, accord|ing to the nature or elevation of the ground: the lower pa&s;tures, though not of the be&s;t quality, are the deare&s;t, becau&s;e being &s;ooner free from the &s;now, and later covered with it, they afford food to cattle for a longer &s;pace.</P>
<P>Each farmer having rented a mountain, hires from the different pea&s;ants in the canton, from 50 to 60 cows, from the 15th of May to the 8th of October: he pays from the rate of from &pound;16, to &pound;1136 per head; and each cow upon an average, yields from 20 to 24 quarts of milk per day, and &s;upplies 200 pounds of chee&s;e, during the five months. On the 18th of October, the farmer re&s;tores the cows to the different proprietors. The cattle are then pa&s;|tured in the meadows, which have been twice mow|ed, until the 10th or 11th of November, when, on account of the &s;now, they are u&s;ually removed to the &s;tables, and fed, during winter, with hay and after|gra&s;s.</P>
<P>As the mountains in the canton of Friburgh, afford pa&s;ture for at lea&s;t 15,000 cows, it may be e&s;timated, that they annually &s;upply about 30,000 hundred weight of chee&s;e, fit for exportation; be&s;ides 2,000 or 3,000 on their return from the mountains, exclu|&s;ive
<PB N="5" REF="5">
of a thinner &s;ort, which is made in various parts of the canton. The chee&s;es fit for exportation, weigh from 40 to 60 pounds each, and are &s;old from &pound;117 to &pound;2, per hundred weight. Be&s;ides the cows which are pa&s;tured during &s;ummer in the moun|tains, the canton contains about 10,000, belonging to the &s;everal land-holders, which &s;upply their fa|milies with milk.</P>
<P>The buildings nece&s;&s;ary for making the chee&s;es, con&s;i&s;t of a <HI>chalet,</HI> or cottage, which contains a room with a furnace, for the purpo&s;e of boiling the milk, a cellar where the milk is pre&s;erved, and a &s;table for 60 or 70 cows; near it is a kind of dairy-room, kept in an equal degree of temperature, where the chee&s;es are every day turned and &s;alted. The thickne&s;s of the Vat, in which each chee&s;e is pre&s;&s;ed, is about four inches. The ca&s;ks for exportation, contain ten chee&s;es, except tho&s;e de&s;tined for Italy, which hold only three, in order to be conveyed by mules acro&s;s the Great S. <HI>Bernard.</HI> The chee&s;es well packed up, bear tran&s;porting into the mo&s;t di&s;|tant countries: they ought to be kept in a damp place, and frequently wa&s;hed with white wine, for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving them from in&s;ects. When the cows return from the mountains, a &s;pecies of cream chee&s;e is made in autumn, and even in win|ter;
<PB N="6" REF="6">
it is much e&s;teemed, and is dearer than that of Gruyerres.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the &s;alt u&s;ed on the&s;e occa|&s;ions, is drawn from Franche Comt&eacute;; a &s;mall quan|tity from Lorraine and Bavaria, but its quality is much inferior. The con&s;umption of the whole canton, for all purpo&s;es, is at lea&s;t 20,000 hundred weight, of which 15,000 is drawn from Franche Comt&eacute;.</P>
<P>A great number of mares, foals, and horned cattle are annually rai&s;ed in the canton: the oxen of three or four years old, are &s;old in the canton of Berne, in the country of Neuchatel, and in Franche Comt&eacute;. Upon an average, it may be e&s;timated, that the can|ton of Friburgh annually &s;upplies pa&s;ture for 37,000 cows and oxen.</P>
<P>In the whole canton of Friburgh, are &s;even towns, the inhabitants of which, &s;peak a kind of patois, or corrupt medley of German and French; but in the town of Friburgh, the pure German prevails among per&s;ons of rank, that language being u&s;ed in the council, the two churches, and in all public in&s;tru|ments.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7">Friburgh the capital, though not one of the mo&s;t beautiful towns, is certainly one of the mo&s;t pictu|re&s;que and wild in Switzerland. It &s;tands partly in a &s;mall plain, partly on bold acclivities, and on a ridge of rugged rocks, half encircled by the river Sane; it is &s;o entirely concealed by the circumja|cent hills, that the traveller &s;carce catches the &s;malle&s;t glimp&s;e of it, until he bur&s;ts upon a view of the whole town from the overhanging eminence.</P>
<P>The fortifications, which con&s;i&s;t of high &s;tone walls and towers, inclo&s;e a circumference of about four miles; within which &s;pace the eye compre|hends a &s;ingular mixture of hou&s;es, rocks, thickets, and meadows, varying in&s;tantly from wild to agree|able, from the bu&s;tle of a town to the &s;olitude of the deepe&s;t retirement.</P>
<P>On all &s;ides the de&s;cent to the town is extremely &s;teep; in one place the &s;treets even pa&s;s over the roofs of the hou&s;es. Many of the edifices are rai&s;ed in regular gradation, like the &s;eats of an amphithe|atre; many overhang the edge of a precipice in &s;uch a manner, that on looking down, a weak head would be apt to turn giddy; and an unfortunate lover, repul&s;ed in his &s;uit, might in&s;tantly put an end to his pains, by taking a leap from the parlour
<PB N="8" REF="8">
window, without the trouble of a journey to Leu|cate, or to the rocks of Meillerie.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of Friburgh are neat and well built, but the whole town has a dull and inanimate ap|pearance. Among the few objects worthy of par|ticular notice, are the cathedral, an elegant gothic edifice, erected in the latter end of the 14th century, and remarkable for the height and &s;olidity of the tower; the town hou&s;e, an ancient building, which formerly compo&s;ed part of the palace belonging to the Duke of Zoeringen; and al&s;o a lime tree in the middle of the principal &s;quare. Tradition reports that this tree was in&s;tantly planted by one of the &s;oldiers, the 22d. of June, 1477, on his return from the battle of Morat: an emblem of Swi&s;s liberty, which took deep root on the memorable defeat of <HI>Charles</HI> the Bold; and thus remaining firm again&s;t the conflicts of time, has continued to &s;pread and flouri&s;h, to the admiration and example of future ages.</P>
<P>The college of Je&s;uits, &s;ays <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> is reckoned the fine&s;t in all Switzerland. There is a great deal of room in it, and &s;everal beautiful views from dif|ferent parts of it. They have a collection of pic|tures repre&s;enting mo&s;t of the fathers of their order, who have been eminent for their piety or learning.
<PB N="9" REF="9">
Among the re&s;t, many Engli&s;hmen whom we name rebels, and they martyrs. <HI>Henry Garnet's</HI> in&s;crip|tion &s;ays, That when the heretics could not prevail with him, either by threats or promi&s;es, to change his religion, they hanged and quartered him. At the Capuchins is the <HI>E&s;cargotiere,</HI> which is the more remarkable as nothing of the kind is to be met with in other countries. It is a &s;quare place boarded in, and filled with a va&s;t quantity of large &s;nails, that are e&s;teemed excellent food when they are well dre&s;&s;ed. The floor is &s;trewed about half a foot deep with &s;everal kinds of plants, among which the &s;nails ne&s;tle all the winter &s;ea&s;on. When Lent arrives they open their magazines, and take out of them the be&s;t meagre food in the world, for there is no di&s;h that they reckon comparable to a ragout of &s;nails.</P>
<P>About a league from Friburgh is an hermitage which has been highly extolled by travellers on ac|count of its &s;ingularity. It is formed in the &s;olid rock, and the chief curio&s;ity con&s;i&s;ts in its having been the work of two men; as &s;uch, it is an a&s;to|ni&s;hing performance, but in any other re&s;pect, it is hardly worth vi&s;iting. In the la&s;t century a hermit &s;cooped out a hollow in this rock, ju&s;t &s;ufficient for him to lie at his full length: but his &s;ucce&s;&s;or de|&s;iring a more commodious apartment, hewed, in the
<PB N="10" REF="10">
heart of the mountain, a chapel, &s;everal apartments, &s;tairca&s;es, &amp;c. The length of the whole is above 400 feet. One room is 90 feet long, and 20 broad; the &s;teeple of this chapel, if it may be &s;o called, is 80 feet high, and the chimney of the kitchen 90. The hermit who perforated this dwelling was near 30 years at the work. What an incredible wa&s;te of time and indu&s;try! But &s;uch is the folly of &s;e|que&s;tered &s;uper&s;tition, that for want of better occu|pations to employ the mind, it frequently has re|cour&s;e to laborious trifles. The &s;ituation of this hermitage is beautiful; the rock, in which it is cut, hangs over the river Saine, which meandring through two chains of hills covered with wood, fills up all the valley beneath.</P>
<P>This canton is entirely catholic. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain above 60,000 inhabitants, without in|cluding the town of Friburgh, in which there are 6,000. The commerce here is too incon&s;iderable to be mentioned, and literature is by no means in a more flouri&s;hing &s;tate. This canton draws con&s;i|derable &s;ub&s;idies from France both in money and &s;alt; and it is computed that in proportion to its &s;ize, none of the other cantons have &s;o many troops in that &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="11">The government of the canton of Friburgh is entirely ari&s;tocratic, the &s;overeign and legi&s;lative authority being ve&s;ted in the great council, con&s;i&s;t|ing of 300; the members of which are cho&s;en from that council, and from a few patrician families. This government re&s;embles the other ari&s;tocratic &s;tates of Switzerland. The mo&s;t remarkable cir|cum&s;tance that di&s;tingui&s;hes it, is the mode of electing the members of the &s;ecret and of the little council. The names of the candidates are pri|vately placed in a box, containing as many divi&s;ions as there are per&s;ons who &s;olicit the vacant office. In one of the&s;e partitions, the electors put in their ballot, as chance directs, without knowing to which of the candidates they may happen to give their vote: he who has mo&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;ual ballots is elected.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Town and Canton of Zuric.</HEAD>
<P>THE learned <HI>Scheuchzer,</HI> calls this canton an epi|tome of all Switzerland, as containing in it, hills, vallies, plains, corn-lands, vineyards, lakes, rivers, vegetables of all kinds, and whatever el&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of life. Grain is culti|vated all over the country, but it ripens later in the mountainous parts, where the air is colder than in the levels or &s;unny vallies. The hilly grounds in the ea&s;t, we&s;t, and &s;outh borders afford a &s;pecimen of the fertile Alps, as abounding in milk, cattle, butter and chee&s;e; and towards Schafhau&s;en and the county of Turgau is a wine country. Fruits al&s;o are every where found here, and very good.</P>
<P>The lake of Zuric is the large&s;t in all this Can|ton, and even one of the large&s;t in Switzerland. It is of an oblong form and between 30 and 40 miles in length, but not more than four in breadth.
<PB N="13" REF="13">
The pro&s;pect from it is delightful; the little emi|nences by which it is bordered, being diver&s;ified with towns, villages, cornfields, and vineyards; and behind the&s;e is every where a gradual a&s;cent of larger hills, terminating in the &s;tupendous moun|tains of Glarus, Schweitz, and the Gri&s;ons, the &s;um|mits of which are always covered with ice and &s;now.</P>
<P>The proportion of grain to the other productions of the earth, will appear from the following calcula|tion: There are 217,000 acres laid out in grain, 14,000 in vines, 94,000 in meadows, 42,000 in pa&s;turages, and 103,000 in fore&s;t.</P>
<P>The canton contained, in 1784, 174,572 &s;ouls; including 10,500 in the capital. This large popu|lation, in proportion to the &s;ize of the canton, is owing to the trade of Zuric; as at lea&s;t two thirds of the inhabitants derive their livelihood by &s;pin|ning thread and &s;ilk, and making linen for the ma|nufactures of the town.</P>
<P>As &s;ufficient corn is not produced for &s;o large a population, the deficiency is chiefly &s;upplied from Swabia. And in order to prevent a &s;carcity of &s;o material an article, a public granary is maintained at the expence of government. The grain is retailed at the common price; but, in &s;ea&s;ons of &s;carcity, it
<PB N="14" REF="14">
is &s;old con&s;iderably cheaper, than it can be pur|cha&s;ed at the market. The good effects of this e&s;|tabli&s;hment, appeared in a &s;carcity of &s;corn, in the year 1771; when on account of its dearne&s;s, a pound of bread was &s;old for ten pence, the &s;ame quantity was delivered by government for four-pence.</P>
<P>In the li&s;t of tho&s;e cantons, in which abundance is vi&s;ible, &s;ays <HI>De Langle,</HI> that of Zuric ought not to be forgotten. The clothes of the poore&s;t peo|ple, are not di&s;figured with either rents or dirt; they po&s;&s;e&s;s good &s;tockings, good &s;hoes, and good linen. I have traver&s;ed this canton &s;everal times&mdash;I have frequently &s;een the &s;hirts and &s;hifts hung out to dry; and of 30, I have &s;carce perceived three to have a &s;ingle darn in them.</P>
<P>Nor is there a town here, however &s;mall it may be, where there is not a fle&s;h market. An ox bleed|ing under the knife of a butcher, &s;eems to lo&s;e all its horrors in the villages of this canton.</P>
<P>A pea&s;ant eat beef! What a theme, adds <HI>De Langle,</HI> for bitter reflections to the inhabitants of cities, who but too frequently can &s;carce procure bread!</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15">The hou&s;es, however, do not corre&s;pond with the neatne&s;s and rural luxury of their garments. The furniture and uten&s;ils of cookery, the in&s;tru|ments of labour, and the ve&s;&s;els of wood and earth|en-ware, are far from numerous. The generality of the towns and villages are ill-built&mdash;the hou&s;es con&s;tructed of wood&mdash;and the roofs badly covered, &s;carce exclude the burning rays of the &s;un, or the rigours of cold, and the inconveniences of wind and rain; almo&s;t the whole of them are without doors, and the inhabitants enter by the window!</P>
<P>The city of Zuric, &s;tands at the northern extre|mity of the lake, and occupies both &s;ides of the ra|pid and tran&s;parent Limmat. Its environs are ex|tremely delightful; and exhibit an amphitheatre of hills, gradually &s;loping to the borders of the wa|ter, enriched with pa&s;ture and vines; dotted with innumerable villas, cottages, and hamlets; and backed on the we&s;t, by a bold and gloomy ridge of mountains, which ri&s;es gradually towards the Alps.</P>
<P>The town is divided into two parts; the old part, &s;urrounded with the &s;ame ancient battlements and towers, which exi&s;ted in the 13th century; and the &s;uburbs, which are &s;trengthened by fortifications in the modern &s;tile, but too exten&s;ive. The ditches,
<PB N="16" REF="16">
in&s;tead of being filled with &s;tagnant water, are mo&s;tly &s;upplied with running &s;treams. The public walk is plea&s;antly &s;ituated in a lawn, at the junction of the Limmat and the Sil, an impetuous and turbid torrent, which de&s;cends from the mountains of Ein&s;idlin, two rows of lime trees, planted by the &s;ide of the Limmat, and following its &s;erpentine di|rection, afford an agreeable &s;hade in the heat of &s;ummer. The inhabitants are very indu&s;trious, and carry on with &s;ucce&s;s, &s;everal manufactures: the principal are tho&s;e of linens, cottons, mu&s;lins, and &s;ilk handkerchiefs. The manufacturers do not in general, dwell within the walls; but the materials are mo&s;tly prepared, and the work is completed in the adjacent di&s;tricts. For this rea&s;on, Zuric does not exhibit the activity and numbers of a great commercial city. The environs, on the contrary, are &s;o extremely populous, that perhaps few di&s;|tricts in the neighbourhood of a town, who&s;e popu|lation &s;carcely exceeds 10,000 inhabitants, contain within &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s, &s;o many &s;ouls. The &s;treets are mo&s;tly narrow; the hou&s;es and public buildings, accord more with plainne&s;s and conve|nience, than with the elegance and &s;plendor of a ca|pital.</P>
<P>The increa&s;e of luxury and opulence, will appear from con&s;idering, that in 1357, the number of men-&s;ervants
<PB N="17" REF="17">
amounted to only 84, and of maid-&s;ervants to 263; whereas, in 1780, the former were 223, and the latter, 1734; or near a fifth of the whole popu|lation. In 1357, the amount of the whole popula|tion was 12,000 inhabitants, and in 1780, there were 10,000 inhabitants and upwards.</P>
<P>The manners of the inhabitants, are in general &s;imple, and may perhaps in the&s;e times be e&s;teemed antiquated. Dinner is u&s;ually &s;erved at 12: in the afternoon, the gentlemen a&s;&s;emble in clubs, or &s;mall &s;ocieties in the town during winter, and at their re|&s;pective villas in &s;ummer. They frequently &s;moke, and partake of wine, fruit, cakes, and other re|fre&s;hments. The women, for the mo&s;t part em|ployed in their dome&s;tic occupations, or devoted to the improvement of their children, are not fond of vi&s;iting. When they go out, they generally a&s;&s;em|ble in &s;eparate coteries, to which only a few men, and tho&s;e chiefly the neare&s;t relations, are admitted; many of the ladies indeed, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their provincial accent, and a difficulty of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves in French, &s;eldom make their appear|ance, when &s;trangers are received.</P>
<P>This re&s;erve, however, among the ladies, begins greatly to abate, and to give place to a more &s;oci|able intercour&s;e. Such, however, is the prevalence
<PB N="18" REF="18">
of national habit, that a few families, which form a more agreeable mixture of company, are con&s;idered as differing from the e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms, and are &s;till known by the name of the French &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Sumptuary laws, as well as tho&s;e again&s;t immo|rality, are here well ob&s;erved. The former indeed, may exi&s;t, and be carried into execution, even among a people much corrupted; for it may be the policy of government, to enforce their ob&s;ervance. But the &s;evere&s;t penalties will not be &s;ufficient to prevent crimes of an immoral tendency, amid&s;t a general di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of manners: it is the popular principles that can alone invigorate &s;uch laws, and give them their full operation. Among their &s;ump|tuary laws, the u&s;e of a carriage in the town is pro|hibited to all &s;orts of per&s;ons, except &s;trangers, and it is almo&s;t inconceivable, that, in a place &s;o commercial and wealthy, luxury &s;hould &s;o little prevail.</P>
<P>At Zuric, the original Swi&s;s &s;pirit of indepen|dence prevails, more than in any of the large towns in this country. The magi&s;trates, le&s;s influenced by foreign courts, and above corruption, generally con&s;ult the real advantage of their canton, and of the Helvetic confederacy. Zuric &s;till pre&s;erves in the general diet, a very con&s;iderable &s;way, which
<PB N="19" REF="19">
&s;he de&s;erves, more from the opinion entertained of her integrity, than from her power: &s;he is looked up to, as one of the mo&s;t independent and upright of the 13 cantons.</P>
<P>The charitable e&s;tabli&s;hments at Zuric, are the orphan hou&s;e, which is regulated with extreme at|tention and care; an alms-hou&s;e for poor burghers, an ho&s;pital for incurables, and that for the &s;ick of all nations, which u&s;ually contains between &s;ix or 700 patients; and the <HI>Allmo&s;en-Amt,</HI> or foundation for the poor: this excellent in&s;titution, puts out children as apprentices; and di&s;tributes money, clothes, and books of devotion to poor per&s;ons, as well in the town, as in different parts of the canton, at the recommendation of the re&s;pective mini&s;ters. In 1778, it di&s;tributed &pound;5451.</P>
<P>Among the particular in&s;titutions, mu&s;t not be omitted the chirurgical &s;eminary; it is formed by voluntary &s;ub&s;criptions, and meets with great encou|ragement.</P>
<P>At Zuric, public education is a matter of &s;tate, and under the immediate protection of government. The principal literary e&s;tabli&s;hments for the in&s;truc|tion of youth are, the Caroline College for &s;tudents in divinity; the college for polite literature, and the
<PB N="20" REF="20">
&s;chool of arts. The learned languages, divinity, natural hi&s;tory, mathematics, and in &s;hort, every &s;pecies of polite learning, as well as ab&s;tru&s;e &s;cience, is taught at &s;mall expence in the&s;e re&s;pective &s;emi|naries.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the unremitted attention, which, &s;ince the reformation, government has paid to the education of youth, many eminent per&s;ons have flouri&s;hed in all branches of literature; and there is no town in Switzerland, where letters are more encouraged, or where they have been culti|vated with greater &s;ucce&s;s. A learned profe&s;&s;or of Zuric, has, in a very intere&s;ting publication, di&s;|played the important &s;ervices, which erudition and &s;cience have derived from the labours of his coun|trymen. In tho&s;e biographical memoirs appear, among many others, the names of <HI>Zuingle, Bullinger, Conrad, Ge&s;ner, Hottinger, Simler, Spon, Scheutzer, Heydegger, Breitinger, Bodmer, Hertzel, Solomon Ge&s;ner,</HI> and <HI>Lavater.</HI></P>
<P>The curio&s;ity of the naturali&s;t will be amply gra|tified by a view of the library and cabinet of Mr. <HI>John Ge&s;ner,</HI> profe&s;&s;or of phy&s;ics, and canon of the cathedral, who inherits the zeal for natural hi&s;tory, which characterized his great ance&s;tor <HI>Conrad Ge&s;|ner.</HI> His cabinet is extremely rich in fo&s;&s;ils, and
<PB N="21" REF="21">
remarkable for numerous repre&s;entations of in&s;ects admirably painted by <HI>Schellenberg.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ociety of phy&s;ics owes its origin to Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Heydegger, Schultetz,</HI> and <HI>John Ge&s;ner.</HI> The fir&s;t regular meeting was held in 1745, in a private hou&s;e; and in a few years they received the protec|tion of government, which granted the profits of a lottery towards e&s;tabli&s;hing a fund. There are now about a hundred and twelve members: each pays on his admittance eight florins, or about 17 &s;hillings, and the &s;ame &s;um annually. Since 1757, a &s;uit of apartments in a hou&s;e, belonging to one of the tribes, has been a&s;&s;igned for holding their a&s;&s;emblies, and for containing their library and apparatus.</P>
<P>The grand and principal object of this &s;ociety, is the encouragement and improvement of practical agriculture. For this purpo&s;e the members corre&s;|pond with landholders in different parts of the can|ton, vi&s;it various di&s;tricts in rotation; offer prizes for improvements in cultivation; and furni&s;h &s;mall &s;ums of money to the poorer pea&s;ants.</P>
<P>The public library at Zuric contains about 25,000 volumes, and a few curious manu&s;cripts. Among the latter are the following: 1, The original ma|nu&s;cript of <HI>Quintilian,</HI> found in the library of S.
<PB N="22" REF="22">
<HI>Gallen,</HI> and from which the fir&s;t edition of that great rhetorician was printed. 2. The p&s;alms, in the Greek tongue, written on parchment, dyed of a vi|olet colour. The letters are &s;ilver, except the ini|tials, which are in gold characters, and the margi|nal references are red. 3. Three Latin letters from Lady <HI>Jane Grey,</HI> to <HI>Bullinger,</HI> in 1551, 1552, and 1553. The&s;e letters, written with her own hand, breathe a &s;pirit of the mo&s;t unaffected piety, and prove the extraordinary progre&s;s which this unfor|tunate and accompli&s;hed prince&s;s, though only in the 16th year of her age, had made in various branches of literature. The Greek and Hebrew quotations &s;hew that &s;he was well acquainted with the&s;e languages. This library is al&s;o rich in the be&s;t editions of the cla&s;&s;ics; and particularly in the early impre&s;&s;ions of the 13th century.</P>
<P>The &s;overeign power re&s;ides exclu&s;ively in the burge&s;&s;es of the town, con&s;i&s;ting of about 2,000.</P>
<P>The burghers, be&s;ide the advantage of electing their magi&s;trates, and of a&s;piring to the admini&s;tra|tion of affairs, enjoy the &s;ole right of commerce; all &s;trangers, and even &s;ubjects being excluded from e&s;|tabli&s;hing manufactures in the city, or in any part of the canton.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23">The legi&s;lative authority is ve&s;ted by the burghers, in the &s;overeign council of 200; con&s;i&s;ting, how|ever, of 212 members, drawn from the 13 tribes, into which the burghers are divided, and compri&s;ing the &s;enate or little council.</P>
<P>A burgher is qualified to vote at 20; is eligible into the &s;overeign council, at 30; and into the &s;e|nate, at 35. By the&s;e wi&s;e regulations, a man mu&s;t have formed &s;ome experience in public affairs, before he is capable of holding an important charge.</P>
<P>The revenues of government, though not ex|ceeding &pound;65,000 <HI>per Annum,</HI> are more than propor|tionate to the expences; which are regulated with the &s;tricte&s;t economy. The &s;tate is not only without debts, but an annual &s;aving is depo&s;ited in the public trea&s;ury, for a re&s;ort upon any public emer|gency.</P>
<P>Zuric was the fir&s;t town in Switzerland, that &s;e|parated from the church of Rome; being converted by the arguments of <HI>Zuingle.</HI> The example of Zuric, was &s;oon followed by Berne, Schafhau&s;en, Ba&s;le, with part of Glarus and Appenzel; the other cantons continuing to adhere to the religion of their ance&s;tors. In 1551, religious di&s;putes broke out
<PB N="24" REF="24">
with &s;o much violence and animo&s;ity, as to occa&s;ion a civil war; in which the prote&s;tants were defeated, and <HI>Zuingle</HI> lo&s;t his life, in the 48th year of his age, at the battle of Cappel. Since that period two other religious wars have been kindled; one in 1656, in which the catholics gained the advantage; and the other in 1712, when the prote&s;tants proved vic|torious. The peace of Arace, which terminated the&s;e unhappy di&s;putes, has, it is to be hoped, finally compo&s;ed all religious animo&s;ities. By that treaty it is &s;tipulated, that in all the provinces &s;ubject to cantons of different religions, there &s;hall be a per|fect equality between the two &s;ects, and that they &s;hall both enjoy the &s;ame privileges: to which is ad|ded, an expre&s;s prohibition to each party, not to u&s;e any terms of raillery or contempt, in &s;peaking of their re&s;pective wor&s;hips.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Town and Canton of Lucerne.</HEAD>
<P>LUCERNE, originally &s;ubject to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, was continually expo&s;ed to the inroads of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden, after tho&s;e can|tons had &s;ecured their own liberty and independence. All her commerce to Italy, was by this means in|terrupted; her fair unfrequented, and her citizens compelled to be ever in arms, in order to protect their territory from ince&s;&s;ant depredations. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, in&s;tead of giving the citizens any effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, impru|dently loaded them with additional taxes, as exor|bitant as they were unju&s;t. The con&s;equence was, that Lucerne made her peace with the confederate cantons; and having &s;oon after driven out the Au&s;trian party, entered into a perpetual alliance with the canton of Uri, Schweitz, and Under|walden and became a member of the Helvetic con|federacy.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="26">The acce&s;&s;ion of Lucerne gave additional credit and power to the confederacy; and enabled it in 1386, to re&s;i&s;t all the effort of a great and impla|cable enemy. In that year, <HI>Leopold,</HI> duke of Au|&s;tria, invaded the canton with a numerous army; when the combined troops gained a bloody victory at Sempach, in which <HI>Leopold</HI> lo&s;t his life.</P>
<P>In the accounts of this battle an in&s;tance of pri|vate valour in an individual is recorded, which would have done honour to a Grecian or Roman name; and only wants the pen of a <HI>Thucydides</HI> or a <HI>Livy</HI> to be equalled in fame, to the exploits of the mo&s;t admired heroes of antiquity. The Au&s;trian army, far &s;uperior in number were drawn up in firm battalion, accoutred in heavy armour, and fur|ni&s;hed with long pikes, which they pre&s;ented before them. The Swi&s;s troops were led into the attack in the form of a wedge, in order to open their way into the ranks of the enemy, and to break the &s;oli|dity of the battalion. The latter neverthele&s;s, con|tinuing &s;ometime impenetrable; <HI>Arnold de Winkel|&s;eid,</HI> a native of Underwalden, ru&s;hed alone upon the enemy to certain death; and &s;eizing as many pikes as he could gra&s;p, endeavoured to force through the ranks but was killed in the attempt. His patriotic valour was not exerted in vain; it in|flamed the Swi&s;s with new courage, and taught them
<PB N="27" REF="27">
the be&s;t method of penetrating into the battalion; which they at length effected, after the mo&s;t de&s;|perate efforts of invincible re&s;olution.</P>
<P><HI>Leopold</HI> him&s;elf might have e&s;caped when his troops fir&s;t began to give way; but with a magna|nimity worthy of a better fate he determined, after having been a witne&s;s to the total rout of his army, not to &s;urvive &s;o ignominious a day: accordingly he ru&s;hed into the thicke&s;t of the enemy and was &s;lain.</P>
<P>In the ar&s;enal of this place are &s;till pre&s;erved his armour, together with a large quantity of cords; which, according to the tradition of the country, he is &s;aid to have brought with him, in order to have bound the citizens of Lucerne. The keeper of the ar&s;enal di&s;plays the&s;e trophies with the &s;ame kind of triumph, as the man who &s;hews the tower of London, points out the chains that were taken on board the Spani&s;h Armada, which he tells &s;trangers, were de&s;tined by <HI>Philip</HI> II. for the principal nobi|lity in England.</P>
<P>The government of Lucerne is entirely ari&s;to|cratical, or rather indeed oligarchical. There are 500 citizens in the town from whom a council of 100, compri&s;ing the &s;enate or council of &s;tate, are
<PB N="28" REF="28">
cho&s;en. The former is the nominal &s;overeign; but the whole power actually re&s;ides in the latter, con|&s;i&s;ting of 36 members, formed like that of Zuric, into two divi&s;ions, which exerci&s;e the office by ro|tation. The council of &s;tate has cognizance of cri|minal cau&s;es; but in ca&s;e of capital condemnation, the &s;overeign council is convoked in order to pro|nounce the &s;entence: a practice worthy of imitation! for the condemnation of a criminal cannot be too maturely weighed; and the more &s;olemnity is u&s;ed in pronouncing the &s;entence, the greater effect it mu&s;t have upon the minds of the people.</P>
<P>As Lucerne is fir&s;t in rank and power among the catholic cantons: all affairs relative to religion are treated in the diet, which a&s;&s;embles in the town every year, compo&s;ed of the deputies of the other cantons: and the Pope's nuncio re&s;ides here. The town contains &s;carcely 3000 inhabitants; has no manufactures of any con&s;equence, and little com|merce; and as to learning, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> it no where meets with le&s;s encouragement, and con&s;equently is le&s;s cultivated.</P>
<P>The whole of what is remarkable in this town may be compri&s;ed in a very &s;hort de&s;cription. The cathedral and the Je&s;uits church are the only pub|lic buildings worth ob&s;erving; but they are too
<PB N="29" REF="29">
much loaded with rich ornaments, and di&s;graced by bad paintings. In the cathedral is an organ of a fine tone, and of an extraordinary &s;ize: of the latter &s;ome judgment may be formed by the dimen&s;ions of the centre pipe, which is &s;aid to be 40 feet in length, and near three in breadth, and weighs 1100 pounds.</P>
<P>The bridges which &s;kirt the town, round the edge of the lake, are the fa&s;hionable walks of the place, and remarkable for their length. They are covered at top, and open at the &s;ides; by which means there is a con&s;tant view of this delightful and romantic country.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are almo&s;t totally engaged in agriculture. The &s;outhern parts of the canton be|ing chiefly mountainous, furni&s;h for exportation cattle, hides, chee&s;e, and butter; all the northern parts is fruitful in corn; the crops of which being more than &s;ufficient for the con&s;umption of the whole canton, there is a con&s;tant exportation of this article from the weekly market held in the town. This commerce is its chief &s;upport.</P>
<P>In Lucerne is to be &s;een a topographical repre|&s;entation of part of Switzerland, which attracts the notice of &s;trangers, and merits the mo&s;t accurate
<PB N="30" REF="30">
attention of the curious traveller. General <HI>Puiffer,</HI> who is the ingenious arti&s;t of this &s;tructure, is a na|tive of the place, and a general in the French &s;er|vice. It is a model in relief; and contains about 60 &s;quare leagues of the mo&s;t mountainous parts of Switzerland; namely, part of the cantons of Lu|cerne, Zug, and Berne, together with the whole of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden. This model is 12 feet long, and nine and a half broad. The prin|cipal part is compo&s;ed of wax, the mountains of &s;tone, and the whole is coloured: but what de&s;erves more particular ob&s;ervation is, that not only the woods of beech, pine, &amp;c. are differently marked; but al&s;o the outward &s;trata of the &s;everal mountains, as well as their form, are di&s;tingui&s;hed. In this work, the General employed about ten years with the utmo&s;t patience and a&s;&s;iduity: he him&s;elf rai&s;ed the plans upon the &s;pots, took the elevations of the mountains and laid them down in their &s;everal proportions. The plan is &s;o minutely exact, that it takes in not only all the mountains, lakes, rivers, towns, villages, and fore&s;ts, but every cottage, every torrent, every bridge, and even every cro&s;s is di&s;|tinctly and accurately repre&s;ented. In the pro&s;e|cution of this laborious performance, he was twice arre&s;ted for a &s;py; and in the popular cantons, was frequently forced to work by moon-light, in order to avoid the jealou&s;y of the pea&s;ants, who would
<PB N="31" REF="31">
have thought their liberty endangered by &s;o exact a plan being taken of their country. As he was obliged to remain for &s;ome time upon the tops of the Alps, where no provi&s;ion could be procured, he generally carried with him a few &s;he-goats, who&s;e milk &s;upplied him with nouri&s;hment. In|deed his per&s;everance in &s;urmounting all the diffi|culties that nece&s;&s;arily aro&s;e in the cour&s;e of this un|dertaking, is almo&s;t inconceivable. When he fi|ni&s;hed any particular part, he &s;ent for the pea&s;ants who re&s;ided near the &s;pot, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who hunted the chamois, and bid them examine accu|rately each particular mountain; whether it cor|re&s;ponded, as far as the &s;mallne&s;s of the &s;cale would admit with its natural appearance: and then, by fre|quently retouching, he corrected the deficiencies.</P>
<P>This model exhibiting the mo&s;t mountainous parts of Switzerland, conveys a &s;ublime picture of an im|men&s;e body of Alps, piled one upon another, as if the &s;tory of the Titans were realized, and they had &s;ucceeded at lea&s;t in one part of the globe in heap|ing an O&s;&s;a upon Pelion, and an Olympus upon O&s;&s;a. The General informed me, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> and it is &s;omewhat remarkable, that the top of the Alps, which cro&s;s Switzerland in the &s;ame line, are nearly of the &s;ame level: or in other words, there are con|tinued chains of mountains of the &s;ame elevation,
<PB N="32" REF="32">
ri&s;ing in progre&s;&s;ion to the highe&s;t range; and from thence gradually de&s;cending in the &s;ame propor|tion towards Italy.</P>
<P>Lucerne, &s;ays <HI>Martyn</HI> is &s;ituated at the extremity of a mo&s;t beautiful lake, where the river Reu&s;s i&s;&s;ues from it. This river &s;eparates the town into two un|equal parts, which are connected by three bridges; one wide, for carriages, and two narrow covered ones, for foot pa&s;&s;engers: be&s;ides the&s;e there is a fourth, over an arm of the lake, to pa&s;s to the cathedral. Three of the&s;e bridges have old bad paintings, of the dance of death, and the hi&s;tory of the bible, and of Switzerland. The buildings are ancient, and the &s;treets narrow; nor is Lucerne populous in propor|tion to its extent. Since this is the great pa&s;&s;age to Italy by mount <HI>S. Gothard;</HI> and the merchan|dize which comes from the Alps on mules, and is to be tran&s;ported by the rivers Reu&s;s, Aar, and Rhines, is all depo&s;ited here: it might have a flouri&s;hing trade of arts and manufactures were it attended to.</P>
<P>The lake of Lucerne exhibits greater variety, and more picture&s;que &s;cenery than any other of the Swi&s;s lakes. It is &s;even leagues long in a right line, and three wide about Ku&s;snacht; but the &s;hape is very irregular. The town of Lucerne, forms a fine ob|ject at one extremity. Mount Pelat, and the Rugi,
<PB N="33" REF="33">
are noble mountains: the fir&s;t well known to na|turali&s;ts for the variety of its plants and fo&s;&s;ils; the &s;econd, peculiarly fitted to give a view over great part of Switzerland. At the foot of this, is the &s;malle&s;t republic, and perhaps the mo&s;t perfect democracy in Europe, that of Ger&s;aw. The inha|bitants are about 1000; it is ab&s;olutely indepen|dent; and under the protection of the four cantons. The &s;cenery of that part, which is called the lake of Uri, is particularly &s;ublime: it is narrow, and edged on both &s;ides with the mo&s;t wild and romantic rocks, with woods of beech and pine, down to the very waters edge.</P>
<P>But this lake is particularly intere&s;ting, for hav|ing been the theatre, whereon the independency of Switzerland was originally planned. Here is the chapel of <HI>William Tell,</HI> on a rock jutting out into the lake, under a hanging wood: and the village of Brunnen, where the treaty of 1315, was &s;igned between Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden. Schweitz, the capital of the canton, is but two miles from it.</P>
<P>The canton of Lucerne, holds the third place among the 13, and is the head of the catholic can|tons. Though le&s;s than Zuric, and con&s;equently le&s;s than Berne, it is, however, far more exten&s;ive
<PB N="34" REF="34">
than any of the re&s;t, being 15 or 16 leagues long, and eight broad. The population is e&s;timated at 100,000. The difference between Zuric and Lu|cerne, is very &s;triking; there, every body is em|ployed in u&s;eful arts and manufactures: here, all is gay, and plea&s;ure &s;eems the only pur&s;uit.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Town and Canton of Soleure.</HEAD>
<P>SOLEURE is plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the Aar, which here expands its banks, and opens into a fine broad river. It is a &s;mall, but extremely neat town, and is &s;urrounded by regular &s;tone fortifica|tions, erected in the beginning of the pre&s;ent cen|tury; their walls enclo&s;e a circumferance of &s;carcely more than 50 &s;quare acres, and including the &s;uburbs, contain about 4000 &s;ouls. Among the mo&s;t remarkable objects of curio&s;ity in this town, is the new church of S. Urs. It is a noble edifice,
<PB N="35" REF="35">
of whiti&s;h grey &s;tone, drawn from the neighbour|ing quarries, which admits a poli&s;h, and is a &s;pecies of rude marble. The lower part of the building, is of the Corinthian, the upper of the Compo&s;ite or|der: the facade, which con&s;i&s;ts of a portico, &s;ur|mounted by an elegant tower, pre&s;ents it&s;elf finely at the extremity of the principal &s;treet. <HI>Pizoni</HI> was the architect, and the expence amounted to at lea&s;t &pound;80,000; a con&s;iderable &s;um for &s;o &s;mall a republic, who&s;e revenues &s;carce &s;urpa&s;s &pound;12,000 <HI>per Annum.</HI> A picture by <HI>Rubens</HI> and his &s;cholars, in the church of the Cordeliers, and one by <HI>Le Saeur,</HI> in that of the Capuchins, de&s;erve perhaps to be noticed by the traveller, who is fond of the fine arts. The town-hou&s;e is not in it&s;elf worthy of ob&s;ervation, but is mentioned only as being the place of meeting for the great council and &s;enate.</P>
<P>The public pri&s;on, newly con&s;tructed, is a &s;olid edifice of &s;tone, and is well adapted to the purpo&s;e of the building; the pri&s;oners being confined in &s;e|parate cells. Although the penal laws are &s;evere in theory, yet the judicial &s;entences, in criminal affairs, are &s;o remarkably mild, that a pri&s;oner, on his ac|quital, wrote the following in&s;cription on the wall of his cell: "He who is inclined to rob, and e&s;cape hanging, let him rob in the canton of Soleure." The Je&s;uits church is famous for its paintings,
<PB N="36" REF="36">
&s;tucco-work, and fronti&s;piece, towards which, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. gave 10,000 livres.</P>
<P>The public library de&s;erves to be mentioned, not for the number or rarity of the volumes, but for the literary zeal of the Abb&eacute; <HI>Herman,</HI> a canon of the cathedral, to whom it owes its origin. In 1776, there was no public collection of books; but a few years ago, that ingenious eccle&s;ia&s;tic, ama&s;&s;ed about 400 volumes from his own and his friends &s;tock, ob|tained from government an apartment in the town-hou&s;e, where he depo&s;ited them, and reque&s;ted to be appointed librarian, but without a &s;alary. His petition being granted, he continued to augment his little collection; and from this &s;mall beginning, has increa&s;ed it already to 11,000 books, among which are above 150 printed in the 15th century. At the two extremities of the room, are in&s;cribed the names of the benefactors to the library. As yet there is no fund e&s;tabli&s;hed for its &s;upport or aug|mentation.</P>
<P>The Abb&eacute; has al&s;o begun to form a cabinet of medals, which, though &s;mall, will increa&s;e like the library. Great merit is due to the Abb&eacute;, for hav|ing given birth to this collection, at fir&s;t alone and un&s;upported, and in &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted a manner, as his income does not exceed &pound;60 <HI>per annum,</HI> and
<PB N="37" REF="37">
in a town where literature is not much encouraged, This learned eccle&s;ia&s;tic is now employed in wri|ting an account of Soleure, at the period of the re|formation, and in collecting ample materials for a complete hi&s;tory of the canton.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to natural hi&s;tory, the only cabinet in the town is that formed by Senator <HI>Wallier:</HI> it is a &s;mall collection, but well cho&s;en, and particularly intere&s;ting to the naturali&s;t who travels into tho&s;e parts; becau&s;e the ingenious collector has confined him&s;elf chiefly to the minerals and petrefactions of the canton.</P>
<P>The environs of this city are planted with very fine walks; and the circumjacent country is exceed|ingly plea&s;ing and diver&s;ified, and exhibits &s;everal points of view, which are as agreeable as wild, and as plea&s;ing as romantic. Among the&s;e is the &s;itua|tion of a hermitage, about half a mile from the town, which is remarkably &s;triking: it is a mo&s;t agreeable rece&s;s at the extremity of a &s;mall wood, and between two ridges of bare perpendicular rocks, watered by a lively &s;tream; one extremity is clo&s;ed by a &s;mall wood, and the other opens into fertile grounds, backed by the dark mountains of Jura.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="38">The canton of Soleure is nearly twelve leagues in length, and &s;even in its greate&s;t breadth; &s;tretching partly through the plain, and partly along the ridges of the Jura. Its population may amount to be|tween 40 and 50,000 &s;ouls, of which the capital contains about 5000: all the inhabitants of the can|ton are catholics.</P>
<P>The government is ari&s;tocratical, upon much the &s;ame plan as that of Lucerne, and of Fribourg: the patrician families are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the public employments. The &s;overeign council con&s;i&s;ts of 125 members, from which the &s;enate or acting council, con&s;i&s;ting of 35, is elected.</P>
<P>The revenues of this government, and the &s;tipends of the numerous places held under it, are by no means &s;mall; &s;o that the chief families derive, from the &s;everal parts they po&s;&s;e&s;s, very profitable emo|luments.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of this canton is exceedingly fertile, and tho&s;e di&s;tricts which lie within the Jura, abound in excellent pa&s;ture: but there is a great want of hands for all the purpo&s;es of agriculture; Never|thele&s;s the ground is &s;o particularly favourable to corn, that a third part of the yearly produce may be exported, without the lea&s;t detriment to the public.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Town and Canton of Ba&s;le.</HEAD>
<P>TO the ea&s;t this canton is bounded by the Frick|thal, to the &s;outh and we&s;t by the canton of Soleure; and to the north by the Margravate of Baden Durlach, and by Rheinfalden, a foreign di|&s;trict in Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>From Ba&s;le, as far as Lich&s;tal and Si&s;&s;ach, the whole country abounds in corn and wine; but be|yond it, is extremely mountainous, cold, and even barren, except that on the&s;e mountains; and in the valleys are the mo&s;t beautiful pa&s;tures covered with cattle. In the city of Ba&s;le are divers medicinal &s;prings, and in the re&s;t of the country, baths of ap|proved virtue.</P>
<P>In the whole canton are three towns, and it has con&s;tantly per&s;evered in the profe&s;&s;ion of prote&s;tan|ti&s;m, ever &s;ince the introduction of that religion in 1529.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="41">Ba&s;le, the capital, is beautifully &s;ituated upon the banks of the Rhine, near the point where that ri|ver, which here becomes very broad, deep, and ra|pid, after flowing &s;ome way from ea&s;t to we&s;t, turns &s;uddenly to the north. It con&s;i&s;ts of two towns joined together by a long bridge; the large town lies on the &s;ide of Switzerland, and the &s;mall town on the oppo&s;ite banks of that river. It &s;tands very favourably for commerce; an advantage which the inhabitants have by no means neglected: for they have e&s;tabli&s;hed a great variety of manufactures, particularly of ribbands and cottons; and an exten|&s;ive trade is carried on by the principal merchants.</P>
<P>The cathedral is an elegant gothic building, but &s;trangely disfigured by a daubing of ro&s;e-coloured paint, &s;pread over the whole edifice.</P>
<P>In this church are depo&s;ited, under a marble tomb, the venerable remains of the great <HI>Era&s;mus.</HI> This di&s;tingui&s;hed writer, joined to &s;uperior learning, and a peculiar elegance of &s;tyle, the keene&s;t wit, which he pointed, not only again&s;t the vices and ig|norance of the monks, but the general corruption and di&s;orders of the Roman church. He was indeed the forerunner of <HI>Luther,</HI> in his fir&s;t attack upon the catholics, re&s;pecting the &s;ale of indulgences: but af|terwards, when the controver&s;y appeared more &s;eri|ous,
<PB N="42" REF="42">
and an open breach with the court of Rome &s;eemed inevitable, he condemned the proceedings of that bold reformer. <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> reflected much ho|nour upon this town by choo&s;ing it as the favourite place of his re&s;idence, and publi&s;hing from hence the greate&s;t part of his valuable works. In the public library are pre&s;erved, with great veneration, &s;everal of his letters, his la&s;t te&s;tament, written with his own hand; as al&s;o his hanger and &s;eal.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity of Ba&s;le, founded by Pope Pius II. in 1459, was formerly eminent in the literary hi&s;tory of Europe. If it has fallen from its pri&s;tine &s;tate of renown, its decline mu&s;t be principally imputed to the ca&s;ual method of electing the profe&s;&s;ors; but it &s;till boa&s;ts &s;everal members who do honour to their native town by their learning and abilities.</P>
<P>The public library contains a &s;mall collection of books, chiefly remarkable for &s;everal rare and va|luable editions; particularly of tho&s;e printed in the 15th century. The mo&s;t curious manu&s;cripts are numerous letters of the fir&s;t reformers, and of other learned men in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries; and an account of the proceedings at the council of Ba&s;le.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="43">In a &s;uit of rooms belonging to this library, is a cabinet of petrefactions; &s;ome ancient medals and gems; a few antiquities found at Aug&s;t; a large number of prints, and &s;ome fine drawings and paint|ings, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of originals by <HI>Holbein,</HI> who was a native of this town. The&s;e pictures are mo&s;t of them in the highe&s;t pre&s;ervation: the connoi&s;ieur can here trace all the different manners of <HI>Holbein,</HI> and compare the productions of his youth with tho&s;e of his maturer age.</P>
<P>Among the works of <HI>Holbein,</HI> that di&s;cover the liveline&s;s of his fancy, mu&s;t be mentioned the &s;ketches which he drew on peru&s;ing the eulogium of Folly, by <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> upon the margin of that work; which he had received as a pre&s;ent from the author. This curious volume is pre&s;erved in the library with great attention; and has been lately publi&s;hed in French, Latin, and German by M. <HI>Haas,</HI> with fac-&s;imilies of the original de&s;igns, engraved on wood.</P>
<P>The dance of death, in the church-yard of the predicants, of the &s;uburbs of S. John, is frequently &s;hewn to &s;trangers as being of <HI>Holbein's</HI> pencil. It is painted in oil colours, upon a wall enclo&s;ing the bu|rial ground; but as it has been retouched &s;everal times, no traces are di&s;coverable of that great ma&s;|ter's
<PB N="44" REF="44">
hand. In fact the <HI>Hon. Horace Walpole,</HI> and other unque&s;tionable judges, have proved that this performance was painted before <HI>Holbein,</HI> and that he was not employed even in retouching it.</P>
<P>Ba&s;le is the large&s;t, and &s;eems formerly to have been one of the mo&s;t populous towns in Switzerland: its extent is capable of containing above 100,000 inhabitants; whereas it can &s;carcely number 11,000. Many particular cau&s;es may have occurred to oc|ca&s;ion this remarkable decrea&s;e of people; but the following is the principal rea&s;on to which it may be a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>It is proved from undoubted calculations, that, in all great cities, the number of burials exceeds that of births: con&s;equently, unle&s;s this unequal proportion is compen&s;ated by a con&s;tant acce&s;&s;ion of new inhabitants, in proce&s;s of time every great town mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily become depopulated. Now the citizens of Ba&s;le are &s;o jealous of the burgher&s;hip, and pride them&s;elves &s;o much upon the privileges which accompany it, that they &s;eldom deign to con|fer it upon foreigners: a &s;upply therefore to balance this gradual wa&s;te of people, can never be derived from an influx of &s;trangers, where they are not per|mitted to carry on commerce, or follow any trade. A few years ago, &s;ome of the magi&s;trates procured
<PB N="45" REF="45">
a law, by which the freedom of the town, and the right of burgher&s;hip was allowed to be conferred on &s;trangers; but it was clogged with &s;o many re&s;tric|tions, as by no means to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e for which it was intended, for bodies of men are &s;eldom actuated by &s;o generous a &s;pirit, as to &s;acrifice their per&s;onal and immediate advantages, to the future welfare and pro&s;perity of their country.</P>
<P>A very remarkable &s;ingularity in this town, which &s;urpri&s;es every &s;tranger is, that all the clocks con|&s;tantly go an hour fa&s;ter than the real time. Differ|ent rea&s;ons have been a&s;&s;igned for this. Some a&s;&s;ert, that it was fir&s;t practi&s;ed during the council at Ba&s;le, in order to a&s;&s;emble at an earlier hour, the cardinals and bi&s;hops, who being very lazy and indolent, al|ways arriving too late. Others maintain, that a con|&s;piracy being formed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the magi&s;trates at midnight, one of the burgo-ma&s;ters, who had notice of the de&s;ign, cau&s;ed the clock-maker to advance the town-clock an hour; by which means, the con&s;pi|rators, imagining the appointed time was elap&s;ed, retired: and that the clocks are kept &s;till in the &s;ame advance, to commemorate that happy deliver|ance. But there is a third rea&s;on given for this &s;trange cu&s;tom, which &s;eems the mo&s;t probable. It is well known, that the choirs of cathedrals are con|&s;tructed towards the ea&s;t; that of Ba&s;le, declines
<PB N="46" REF="46">
&s;omewhat from this direction; and the &s;un-dial which is placed on the out&s;ide of the choir, and by which the town-clock is always regulated, partakes of this declination; a circum&s;tance which, according to the celebrated <HI>Bernoville,</HI> occa&s;ions a variation from the true time above five and forty minutes.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Ba&s;le, are &s;till &s;o attached to this whim&s;ical cu&s;tom, that, although it has been often propo&s;ed in the &s;overeign council to regulate their clocks properly, yet the motion has been in|variably rejected; and the people would &s;u&s;pect that their liberties were invaded, if their clocks were to agree with tho&s;e of the re&s;t of Europe. A few years &s;ince, &s;everal leading men of the town deter|mined to alter the hand of the &s;un-dial half a mi|nute a day until the &s;hadow &s;hould imperceptibly point to the true hour. This expedient was accordingly adopted, and the clock had already lo&s;t near three quarters of an hour when an accident di&s;covered the de&s;ign: the magi&s;trates were accord|ingly compelled to place the hand of the &s;un-dial in its former po&s;ition, and to regulate the hours by it as u&s;ual. Long e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom, however ridi|culous, is apt to make &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion upon vulgar minds, as to become &s;ometimes dan|gerous, and always difficult to be aboli&s;hed. It
<PB N="47" REF="47">
was no incon&s;iderable length of time, before we in England could be per&s;uaded to reckon our years according to the general mode of computation re|ceived by the re&s;t of Europe.</P>
<P>The bridge over the Rhine is 250 common paces in length, and makes a good appearance. On the tower which &s;tands towards France is a Moor's head crowned, which every minute thru&s;ts out its long red tongue. This droll figure, however does not di&s;gu&s;t like that filthy repre&s;entation which &s;tands in a little cabin in the middle of the bridge, before which the public pro&s;titutes, when bani&s;hed from the town are found to undergo &s;ome ridiculous ceremonies. This Moor's head was ori|ginally a piece of mechanical wit of the famous Clock-maker who &s;aved the town. He made it in deri&s;ion of the enemy he had &s;o dexterou&s;ly de|ceived. It has been repaired and enabled to thru&s;t out its tongue every minute for 400 years pa&s;t, at the expence of the magi&s;trates, who think, as I have ob&s;erved, &s;o excellent a joke cannot be too often repeated.</P>
<P>St. Peter's &s;quare, with its rows of lime trees, is the be&s;t walk in Ba&s;le. In 1689, an oak was planted here, which by the particular arrangement of its wide branches, forms three di&s;tinct landing places or floors.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="48">Not far from the Cathedral is the <HI>Hotel de Ville,</HI> an ancient building; the great room in which the Council a&s;&s;embled in 1481, remains, &s;eemingly in its original &s;tate.</P>
<P>The &s;umptuary laws are very &s;trict here. The u&s;e of coaches in the town is not indeed prohi|bited, as at Zuric; but, what is more &s;ingular, no citizen or inhabitant, is allowed to have a &s;ervant behind his carriage. Laws of this kind may be carried, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to a &s;crupulous and even ridiculous minutene&s;s; upon the whole, however, they are excellent regulations, and not only u&s;eful, but nece&s;&s;ary in a &s;mall republic.</P>
<P>The lower rank of citizens are, in general, &s;o &s;trongly prejudiced in favour of this town, as to &s;eem convinced that true felicity is only to be found at Ba&s;le. Every per&s;on boa&s;ts that he is free, and is &s;o in reality; and as the citizens not only po&s;&s;e&s;s very con&s;iderable privileges and immunities; but each individual may al&s;o indulge the hope of being one day cho&s;en into the &s;overeign council; he en|joys a certain degree of re&s;pect and con&s;ideration extremely flattering to his &s;elf-importance.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Ba&s;le, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> &s;eem to be of a re&s;erved and &s;aturnine di&s;po&s;ition; whether
<PB N="49" REF="49">
natural or affected is not ea&s;y to tell; but the few, &s;ays this writer I conver&s;ed with, had &s;omething uncommonly &s;erious and formal in their manner. How an unremitting gravity and &s;olemnity of man|ner, in the common affairs of life comes to be con|&s;idered as an indication of wi&s;dom, or of extraordi|nary parts is not a little &s;urpri&s;ing. So many ridi|culous things occur every day in this world, that men, who are endowed with that degree of &s;en&s;i|bility, which u&s;ually accompanies genius, find it very difficult to maintain a continued gravity. This difficulty is abundantly felt, even in the grave and learned profe&s;&s;ions; and the individuals who have been mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;urmounting it, and who never deviate from the &s;olemnity of e&s;tabli&s;hed forms, have not always been the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for real knowledge or genius; though they are ge|nerally mo&s;t admired by the multitude, who are very apt to mi&s;take that gravity for wi&s;dom, which proceeds from a literal weight of the brain and muddine&s;s of under&s;tanding. Mi&s;takes of the &s;ame kind are frequently made in forming a judgment of books as well as of men. Tho&s;e which profe&s;s a formal de&s;ign to in&s;truct and reform, and carry on the work methodically till the reader is lulled into repo&s;e, have pa&s;&s;ed for deep and u&s;eful perform|ances; while others, replete with original ob&s;erva|tion and real in&s;truction, have been treated as fri|volous,
<PB N="50" REF="50">
becau&s;e they are written in a familiar &s;tyle, and the precepts conveyed in a &s;prightly and indi|rect manner.</P>
<P>Works compo&s;ed with the laborious de&s;ire of be|ing thought profound, have &s;o very often the mi&s;|fortune to be dull, that &s;ome people have con&s;idered the two terms as &s;ynonimous; and the men who receive it as a rule, that one &s;et of books are pro|found, becau&s;e they are dull; may naturally con|clude, that others are &s;uperficial, becau&s;e they are entertaining. With re&s;pect to books, however, matters are &s;oon &s;et to rights; tho&s;e of puffed and fal&s;e preten&s;ions, die neglected, while tho&s;e of real merit, live and flouri&s;h. But with regard to the men, the cata&s;trophe is often different; we daily &s;ee formal a&s;&s;uming blockheads, flouri&s;h and enjoy the fruits of their pompous impo&s;itions, while many men of talents, who di&s;dain &s;uch arts, live in ob&s;cu|rity, and die neglected.</P>
<P><HI>Moore</HI> here gives a curious anecdote of this &s;atur|nine di&s;po&s;ition, in a Dutchman, whom he &s;upped with at a <HI>table-d'hote</HI> in this city. There were ten or a dozen people at table. I &s;at next to a genteel looking man from Stra&s;burgh, with whom I con|ver&s;ed a good deal, during &s;upper. He had for his companion, a round faced, ro&s;y, plump gentleman,
<PB N="51" REF="51">
from Am&s;terdam, who did not &s;peak French; but the Stra&s;burgher addre&s;&s;ed him from time to time in Low Dutch, to which the other replied by nods</P>
<P>When the retreat of the greater part of the com|pany had contracted the little circle which re|mained, I expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome regret to my Stra&s;burgh acquaintance, that my friend and I could not &s;peak a little Dutch; or that his friend could not &s;peak French, that we might enjoy the plea&s;ure of his con|ver&s;ation. This was immediately tran&s;lated to the Dutchman, who heard it with great compo&s;ure, and then took the pipe from his mouth, and made an an&s;wer, which, with &s;ome difficulty, I got our inter|preter to explain. It was to this effect: That we ought to con&s;ole our&s;elves for the accident of not under&s;tanding each other; for as we had no con|nection or dealing in trade together, our conver&s;a|tion could not po&s;&s;ibly an&s;wer any u&s;eful purpo&s;e. My friend made a low bow to this compliment, &s;aying, that the ju&s;tne&s;s and good &s;en&s;e of that re|mark, had certainly e&s;caped my ob&s;ervation, as he acknowledged it had hitherto done his.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme legi&s;lative power of this canton, re|&s;ides in the great and little councils, con&s;i&s;ting of about 300 members: and the authority of the&s;e two councils combined, is without controul. They
<PB N="52" REF="52">
enact laws; declare war and peace; contract alli|ances; and impo&s;e laws: they elect the &s;everal ma|gi&s;trates; appoint their own members; nominate to all employments; and confer the right of burgher|&s;hip. The general admini&s;tration of government, is committed by the great council to the &s;enate, or little council, that is, to a part of its own body. This &s;enate, compo&s;ed of 60 members, is divided into two bodies, which act by rotation. The acting divi&s;ion continues in office one year; decides finally in all criminal cau&s;es; &s;uperintends the police; and exerci&s;es &s;everal other powers &s;ubordinate to the &s;o|vereign council. The collective body of the citi|zens, a&s;&s;emble once every year, when the magi&s;trates publicly take an oath to maintain the con&s;titution, and pre&s;erve the liberties and immunities of the peo|ple inviolate. The reciprocal oath of obedience to the laws, is al&s;o admini&s;tered to the citizens.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the great and boundle&s;s prero|gative of the great council; yet the meane&s;t citizen is capable of being admitted into that body; for the vacancies in the two councils, are &s;upplied from all ranks of citizens, one cla&s;s only excepted, the mem|bers of the univer&s;ity. Formerly the&s;e elections were determined by a plurality of voices, but as by the&s;e means, the riche&s;t per&s;on was always certain of
<PB N="53" REF="53">
being cho&s;en, a <HI>ternaire</HI> was e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1718, which was afterwards changed into a <HI>&s;enaire,</HI> that is, &s;ix candidates are nominated, and from the&s;e the &s;ucce&s;&s;or is appointed by lot.</P>
<P>But the principal magi&s;trates are not the only per&s;ons cho&s;en by lot; even the profe&s;&s;ors in the Univer&s;ity are elected in the &s;ame manner. Hence nothing is more common than for a candidate to offer him&s;elf for the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of a &s;cience, which he has never made the peculiar object of his &s;tudies; if the chair of that particular &s;cience in which he excels is already occupied: for under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the re&s;pective unqualified pro|fe&s;&s;ors change place with each other.</P>
<P>Near Ba&s;le are the ruins of Augu&s;ta Rauricorum, formerly a large town under the dominion of the Romans, now a &s;mall village in the canton of Ba&s;le clo&s;e to the Rhine. Its ancient remains are very incon&s;iderable, con&s;i&s;ting of a few columns of mar|ble, &s;till &s;tanding, and &s;ome &s;cattered fragments of pillars, together with a &s;emicircular range of walls upon a ri&s;ing ground, the greate&s;t part of which is fallen, and is almo&s;t entirely overgrown with under|wood. From the pre&s;ent appearance of the&s;e ruins, it would &s;carce be conjectured that they once com|po&s;ed
<PB N="54" REF="54">
part of a theatre capable of containing about twelve thou&s;and &s;pectators.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants in turning up the ground where the&s;e ruins are &s;ituated, frequently find medals of the Roman emperors, from <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantine:</HI> and are become, by repeated experience, able to di&s;tingui&s;h, with &s;ome degree of preci&s;ion, tho&s;e that are rare from the more common coins.</P>
<P>M. <HI>Kochlin's</HI> commercial &s;chool at Mulhau&s;en, about fifteen miles from Ba&s;le, de&s;erves to be men|tioned. It is a private academy, for about thirty &s;cholars, who are in&s;tructed in the German, French, and Latin languages; in fencing, dancing, and all polite accompli&s;hments; and more particularly in accounts and book-keeping. The expence, in|cluding a uniform, amounts to 50l. <HI>per annum,</HI> The plan is very judicious, and the whole appears to be well conducted.</P>
<P>At Bellelay about 20 miles from Ba&s;le, in a rich abbey of Benedictines, has been in&s;tituted a military academy for the young nobility and gentry. They are in&s;tructed in the various branches of polite lite|rature, wear uniforms, and are trained to military manoeuvres and exerci&s;es. The cheapne&s;s of this &s;chool, and its di&s;tance from the di&s;&s;ipation of large
<PB N="55" REF="55">
towns, renders it of great public utility. The whole expence of each &s;cholar, for his board, lodg|ing, in&s;truction, and various le&s;&s;ons, &s;carcely ex|ceeds 20l. <HI>per annum.</HI> It is curious to find a mili|tary academy e&s;tabli&s;hed in the mid&s;t of rocks and fore&s;ts, and within the walls of a convent; and to ob&s;erve Benedictine friars, in&s;tead of wa&s;ting their time in monki&s;h ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, render|ing them&s;elves beneficial to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>At Arle&s;heim about four miles from Ba&s;le, is a curio&s;ity of another kind, a hermitage that has been made at con&s;iderable expence, with a view to em|ploy the poor in a time of great &s;carcity, and to provide walks for the inhabitants of the town. The grounds are very exten&s;ive and plea&s;ant. The walks are carried along the &s;ides of the rocks, which are richly wooded, and through a delightful &s;emi|circular plain, bounded by fertile hills, and watered by a &s;mall lake, the borders of which are peculiarly wild and picture&s;que. Several caverns, hollowed and arched by the hand of nature, add to the ro|mantic &s;ingularity of the &s;cenery; while many tran&s;parent &s;treams, conveyed from a con&s;iderable di&s;tance fall in &s;mall ca&s;cades, or bubble from the ground like real &s;prings.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Town and Canton of Schaffhau&s;en.</HEAD>
<P>SCHAFFHAUSEN is the mo&s;t northern of all the cantons of Switzerland, and for the mo&s;t part &s;urrounded by Swabia. It is the twelfth can|ton in rank, and the lea&s;t of them all, being only five leagues in length, and three in breadth. The number of inhabitants is e&s;timated at about 30,000. The Rhine, the cour&s;e of which has been de&s;cribed is the only river of note here. This canton pro|duces a great deal of corn, though not in &s;ufficient quantity for the inhabitants, who are farther &s;up|plied from Swabia. It is abundant in hay and fruit; and of good red wine there is a con&s;iderable quan|tity furni&s;hed for exportation.</P>
<P>Schaffhau&s;en is a neat and tolerably well-built town, &s;ituated upon the northern &s;hore of the Rhine; it is the capital of the canton, and owes its origin to the interruption of that river by the cataract at Lauffen: huts being at fir&s;t con&s;tructed for the con|venience
<PB N="57" REF="57">
of unloading the merchandize from the boats, by degrees increa&s;ed to a large town. Its pre&s;ent population is &s;uppo&s;ed to be about 6,000 in|habitants. It was formerly an imperial city and governed by an ari&s;tocracy, and in 1501 was ad|mitted a member of the Helvetic confederacy. It is &s;lightly fortified, and has a kind of citadel, but no garri&s;on, though a frontier town. The buildings are old fa&s;hioned and indifferent: mo&s;t of them have the name of the inhabitant, the date of the building, and &s;ome device over the door, and &s;ome have the front painted all over. Here and at Ba&s;le, they are fond of &s;alient windows and mirrors to ena|ble them to look up and down the &s;treets: the&s;e are not very narrow, but they are ill paved, with mid|dle and cro&s;s kennels. There are two con&s;iderable churches, the Mun&s;ters and St. John's; in the lat|ter is a library; and there is a &s;econd in the town for the u&s;e of the citizens. At the reformation, a &s;chool or academy was e&s;tabli&s;hed, where the &s;acred languages, and &s;ciences proper for eccle&s;ia&s;ties are taught.</P>
<P>The only thing that can really excite the attention of the judicious &s;tranger in this canton, is the wooden bridge thrown acro&s;s the Rhine, and which is totally di&s;regarded by the inhabitants. This bridge, which is 342 feet long, is entirely covered
<PB N="58" REF="58">
with a roof from one extremity to the other, and is &s;o contrived, that there is no nece&s;&s;ity for any arches to &s;upport it. Every time that a carriage travels along, it yields to the pre&s;&s;ure, &s;wings from one &s;ide to the other, and &s;eems ready to give way; it is however remarkably &s;afe, and has remained in the &s;ame &s;ituation for many years.</P>
<P>This &s;ingular erection is the work of a &s;imple car|penter, of the canton of Appenzel, called <HI>Grubben|mann.</HI> It is a&s;&s;erted, that the whole bridge con&s;i&s;ts entirely of one arch, and the pier which is placed in the middle of the river, was added at the parti|cular de&s;ire of the magi&s;trates of Schaffhau&s;en, who were at once a&s;toni&s;hed and affrighted at the bold|ne&s;s of the undertaking.</P>
<P>The river here, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> is extremely rapid, and had already de&s;troyed &s;everal bridges of &s;tone, built upon arches of the &s;tronge&s;t con&s;truction, when this carpenter undertook to throw a wooden one of a &s;ingle arch acro&s;s it. The magi&s;trates however, in|&s;i&s;ted that it &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of two arches, and that he &s;hould make u&s;e for that purpo&s;e, of the middle pier of the old bridge, which remained entire. Accordingly, the architect was obliged to obey; but he has contrived it in &s;uch a manner, that the bridge is not at all &s;upported by the middle pier,
<PB N="59" REF="59">
and it would certainly have been equally &s;afe, and con&s;iderably more beautiful, had it con&s;i&s;ted &s;olely of one arch. It is a wooden bridge, of which the &s;ides and top are covered, and the road over it is almo&s;t perfectly level: it is what the Germans call a <HI>hoengewerk,</HI> or hanging bridge; the road not being carried as u&s;ual over the top of the arch, but is let down into the middle of it and there &s;u&s;|pended. A man of the &s;lighte&s;t weight walking upon it, feels it tremble under him; and yet wag|gons heavily laden pa&s;s over it without danger; and although in the latter in&s;tance, the bridge &s;eems almo&s;t to crack with the pre&s;&s;ure, it does not appear to have ever &s;uffered the lea&s;t damage. It has been compared, and very ju&s;tly, to a tight rope, which trembles when it is &s;truck, but &s;till pre&s;erves its firm and equal ten&s;ion.</P>
<P>When we ob&s;erve the greatne&s;s of the plan, and the boldne&s;s of the con&s;truction, we are a&s;toni&s;hed that the architect was a common carpenter, without the lea&s;t proficiency in learning, totally ignorant of mathematics, and not at all ver&s;ed in the theory of mechanics. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of uncommon natural abili|ties, and a &s;urpri&s;ing turn for the practical part of mechanics, he rai&s;ed him&s;elf to great eminence in his profe&s;&s;ion, and may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t ingenious architects of the pre&s;ent century.
<PB N="60" REF="60">
This bridge was fini&s;hed in le&s;s than three years, and co&s;t 90,000 florins, or about 8000l.</P>
<P>This &s;ame carpenter had agreed to throw a bridge of a &s;ingle arch, and of the &s;ame con&s;truction, over the river Derry in Ireland. The river is 600 feet wide, which, by means of abutments, was to have been reduced to 400; it was to have co&s;t 20,000l. but the plan was not carried into execution for want of proper encouragement.</P>
<P>The whole number of citizens or burge&s;&s;es, in whom the &s;upreme power ultimately re&s;ides, are computed at about 2000; the ar&s;enal is far from being con&s;iderable, yet on an emergency, &s;ufficient to arm the town&s;men and other &s;ubjects; who be|&s;ides are not without nece&s;&s;ary arms, every common inhabitant or pea&s;ant, going to church with his &s;word by his &s;ide: and whoever appears before the magi&s;trates without that weapon and his cloak, in|curs a &s;evere penalty; the &s;word, be&s;ides being an ornament, is a mark of their freedom. Over all the di&s;trict of Mount Jura, as far as it is dependant on the canton of Berne, the men go to church, not only with their &s;words, but their bayonets and firelocks, which, during the &s;ervice, they either keep by them, or hang up in a particular corner of the church; an u&s;age not improbably derived from the frequent
<PB N="61" REF="61">
commotions of former times, and the wars with the Burgundians, again&s;t whom, as an adjacent and dangerous enemy, it behoved them to be continually upon their guard.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom &s;eems to indicate that the blood of the old Germans runs in the veins of the&s;e gallant Swi&s;s, the mo&s;t ancient hi&s;torians relating, that they u&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t at their religious ceremonies, with their &s;words by their &s;ides. And though, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler, Herodotus, Luccan,</HI> and <HI>Ammianus Marcel|linus,</HI> betray an ab&s;urd credulity in advancing that our ance&s;tors u&s;ed to pray to their weapons; yet it is too apparent, that even in later times they attri|buted a kind of &s;acredne&s;s to their &s;words. But this is in &s;ome &s;ort excu&s;able in a people, who maintain the reputation of intrepidity, as an inhe|rent hereditary quality, and therefore called war <HI>oerlogh,</HI> i. e. the olde&s;t law. According to <HI>Cromer's</HI> account of Poland, the nobility of that kingdom, ever &s;ince the more enlightened times of chri&s;tian|ity, long retained the cu&s;tom of half drawing their &s;words when the prie&s;t read the go&s;pel, to te&s;tify their readine&s;s to defend the truths of the &s;acred books, with their lives and fortunes.</P>
<P>The revenues of the &s;tate ari&s;e, partly from the tithes, and other articles of the like nature; but
<PB N="62" REF="62">
principally from the duties laid upon the merchan|dize, which pa&s;&s;es from Germany: the&s;e cu&s;toms are nearly &s;ufficient to defray all the public expences.</P>
<P>Sumptuary laws are in force here, as well as in mo&s;t parts of Switzerland; and no dancing is al|lowed, except upon particular occa&s;ions: &s;ilk, lace, and &s;everal other articles of luxury, are prohibited; even the ladies head-dre&s;&s;es are regulated. But what is of &s;till greater importance, all games of chance are &s;trictly prohibited; and in other games, the party who lo&s;es above &s;ix florins, which make nine &s;hillings of our money, incurs a con&s;iderable fine. An excellent regulation! and further, the&s;e laws are not like ours, mere cyphers, but are well ob&s;erved. The principal article of exportation, is wine; of which a large quantity is made, the coun|try abounding in vineyards: and as the canton fur|ni&s;hes but little corn, it is procured from Suabia, in exchange for wine. In the town there are &s;ome, but not very con&s;iderable manufactures of linen, cotton, and &s;ilk: their commerce, however, is very flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>The people of this canton, like tho&s;e of Berne, are divided into regular companies of militia, which are exerci&s;ed yearly, and are always ready and pre|pared
<PB N="63" REF="63">
to take up arms in defence of their country. This canton has &s;ome troops in the &s;ervice of France, Sardinia, and Holland; the only foreign &s;ervice into which the &s;ubjects of the prote&s;tant can|tons enli&s;t.</P>
<P>The great convenience of the Rhine to the com|merce of Schaffhau&s;en, is twice interrupted between this town and Ba&s;le, by violent falls of the river, which occa&s;ion an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity at each of the&s;e places, to take out the whole lading, and put it on board other ve&s;&s;els. One of the&s;e falls is near Rheinfelden, and though called Hellhaken, is not of any remarkable height, and nothing near &s;o tre|mendous as the other, at about a quarter of a league from Schaffhau&s;en, near the little fort of Lausfen, which &s;tands on the other &s;ide; Lauffen was for|merly in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Au&s;tria, and from it the fall derives its name. I had not an opportunity, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> of taking with any preci&s;ion, the height of the rock, from which the river here precipitates it&s;elf, &s;o mu&s;t rely on the information of the people, who make the height 70 feet, and the breadth about 90 paces. Even before the Rhine reaches this cataract, the ground is very rocky; and, at the fall, divides it&s;elf into three &s;treams, of which the green-beds and &s;ilver vortices make an agreeable contra&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="64">
to the beholder; but at the &s;ame time, his mind can|not help being filled with a mixture of dread and amazement, at the roar of the waters. On the &s;outh or Zuric &s;ide, is the mo&s;t impetuous breach, the violence of the fall altering the water as it were, to a white du&s;t, part of which, like a light cloud or mi&s;t, hovers in the air, and with the intercepted &s;un-beams, forms a variety of mo&s;t brilliant rain|bows. On the rocks which thus divide the Rhine into three &s;treams, grow pines and other trees, and clo&s;e by them, on the Schaffhau&s;en &s;ide, near the village of Neuhau&s;en, is an iron manufacture, which turns to very good account. In the iron ore, of which there is great plenty, are frequently found petrified mu&s;cles and cockles.</P>
<P>From the ca&s;tle of Lauffen, this &s;cene pre&s;ents the mo&s;t picture&s;que and beautiful view that the human fancy ever formed, or the human eye ever dwelt upon.</P>
<P>After the melting of the &s;now, when the river has attained its proper maje&s;ty and grandeur, the fall &s;eems to be about 80 feet perpendicular.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that the Rhine, formerly fell from a much greater height, than at pre&s;ent, and
<PB N="65" REF="65">
that the river, which is daily wearing away the &s;urface of the rocks, will &s;ome time or other, pre&s;ent a plain, level, gla&s;&s;y &s;uperficies, to the view of the a&s;toni&s;hed &s;tranger; who will &s;carce credit tho&s;e tales of his ance&s;tors, by which he was taught to believe that this was once a cata|ract.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of the Gri&s;ons.</HEAD>
<P>THE country of the Gri&s;ons, is divided into three leagues, which unite and form one republic, the grey league, the hou&s;e of God, and the ten juri&s;|dictions. The re&s;pective communities of the&s;e three leagues, have their peculiar con&s;titution, enjoy
<PB N="66" REF="66">
their municipal laws and cu&s;toms, and are inde|pendent commonwealths in all concerns, which do not interfere with the general policy of the whole republic, or the articles of the particular league, of which they form a part: the connection between the three leagues, is maintained, by means of an an|nual diet, compo&s;ed of 63 deputies, and the three chiefs.</P>
<P>This country borders to the ea&s;t, on the territories of Venice and Milan; we&s;t, it joins the canton of Uri; and to the north, the canton of Glarus. Its greate&s;t length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is from 80 to 90 miles; and from 60 to 70 in breadth. Their coun|try is very populous, and it is &s;aid, they can bring 35,000 fighting men into the field.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the country is mountainous, but the levels and vallies produce almo&s;t all &s;orts of grain, with pul&s;e plenty of hay, fruits of &s;everal kinds, and wines. Its hills, which are of a middling height, and enjoy a mild air, yield not only good fodder and hay, but al&s;o rye and barley; and in &s;ome parts cherries, and even on the highe&s;t and mo&s;t bar|ren parts, are good pa&s;ture grounds, be&s;ides many kinds of palatable and whole&s;ome berries, which grow there. The principal occupation of the in|habitants,
<PB N="67" REF="67">
is feeding horned cattle, &s;heep, goats, and &s;wine. Be&s;ides poultry, it al&s;o affords wild fowl; but of bea&s;ts, the continual demand for them, ne|ce&s;&s;arily occa&s;ions a &s;carcity. The principal rivers are the Rhine, the Ina, and the Adda, all of which have their &s;ource in this country. Here are al&s;o &s;everal lakes, mo&s;t of which lie on the &s;ummit of the hills, where they have their i&s;&s;ue from fine &s;prings.</P>
<P>The marmot, likewi&s;e, which is to be found in mo&s;t of the mountains of Switzerland, is particularly common in that part of the Gri&s;ons, called the league of Gods-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In the whole country of the Gri&s;ons, there are but three towns, and tho&s;e not of any note. The German language is mo&s;tly u&s;ed, but in many places, the inhabitants al&s;o &s;peak Italian. In Engadina, they &s;peak a kind of Latin.</P>
<P>The principal food of the inhabitants in the&s;e mountains, is &s;alt-meat, rye-bread, milk, chee&s;e, polenta, and che&s;nuts, which are &s;o plentiful at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, that they make a principal in|gredient in all their meals: the mo&s;t common methods of dre&s;&s;ing them, are to boil, and &s;erve
<PB N="68" REF="68">
them up with crums of bread; or to grind them to a pa&s;te, and then eat them with milk.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants are well clothed. They manufac|ture linen and coar&s;e cloth at home, every family having a loom, which is worked in the winter &s;ea&s;on. But the finer cloth, which they wear only on Sun|days and fe&s;tivals, is procured from Germany.</P>
<P>The revenues of the three leagues ari&s;e from the following articles: from duties upon merchandi&s;e pa&s;&s;ing through the Gri&s;ons, the Valteline, and Chiavenna, which are farmed at the annual rate of about &pound;1259&mdash;from a third of the fines laid upon delinquents in the &s;ubject countries&mdash;from a &s;mall tribute likewi&s;e paid by them&mdash;and la&s;tly from a fund, the principal part of which is &pound;4000 ve&s;ted in the Engli&s;h funds.</P>
<P>The public expenditure is very trifling, being chiefly confined to the expences incurred by the the &s;ittings of diet, and the &s;alaries a&s;&s;igned to the deputies for their attendance.</P>
<P>The commerce of the Gri&s;ons is extremely con|tracted. The only exports are chee&s;e and cattle. As mo&s;t of the Gri&s;on pea&s;ants weave cloth and linen for the u&s;e of their families; it would be no
<PB N="69" REF="69">
difficult undertaking to introduce manufactures in different parts. But it is remarkable that in the&s;e little republics a &s;trange prejudice prevails again&s;t commerce; and that the project of e&s;tabli&s;hing ma|nufactures is oppo&s;ed by many leading men of the country. It is difficult to di&s;cover the rea&s;on of the&s;e illiberal principles; it has been imputed to a &s;u&s;picion, that if the people &s;hould become opulent by commerce, they would be le&s;s open to influence; and the powerful families who now direct the public affairs, would lo&s;e their a&s;cendency. Be&s;ides the&s;e rea&s;ons, which are of too delicate a nature to be openly acknowledged, other motives, of a more ge|nerous complexion, having been a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>The advocates again&s;t extending commerce a&s;&s;ert, that as the true riches of every country con&s;i&s;ts in the products of agriculture, all occupations which turn the attention of the people from that one great object, are detrimental to the general good of &s;ociety; and that in free &s;tates manufactures tend to enervate the inhabitants, to introduce the baneful effects of luxury, to depre&s;s the &s;pirit of freedom, and to de&s;troy the general &s;implicity of manners.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons, however &s;pecious in appearance, will prove fallacious upon mature con&s;ideration. If in a country, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts chiefly by
<PB N="70" REF="70">
agriculture, manufactures are pur&s;ued to the total neglect of hu&s;bandry, they then become detrimen|tal; but this is &s;eldom the ca&s;e, as by adding to the general con&s;umption, manufacturers u&s;ually tend to increa&s;e, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, the products of the earth. Such have been the effects in the mountains of Neuchatel, where the fore&s;ts have been cleared, and the country converted into pa&s;ture, or &s;own with grain. Manufactures and commerce are &s;till further &s;erviceable in augmenting the number of inhabitants, which form the true riches of a country.</P>
<P>The religion of the Gri&s;ons is divided into catho|lic and reformed. By the reformed is meant what we call Calvini&s;m, although it is not the &s;ame as was e&s;tabli&s;hed at Geneva. Among the Gri&s;ons, the prote&s;tants are more numerous than the catholics. In &s;piritual concerns the catholics are generally un|der the juri&s;diction of the Bi&s;hop of Coire. For the affairs of the reformed churches, the &s;upreme authority is ve&s;ted in the &s;ynod, which is com|po&s;ed of three Deans, one for each league, and the clergy. This &s;ynod a&s;&s;embles every year, alter|nately, in each of the three leagues. Candidates for holy orders are examined before the &s;ynod. The nece&s;&s;ary qualification for admi&s;&s;ion into the church ought to be, the knowledge of Hebrew, Greek,
<PB N="71" REF="71">
and Latin; but this rule is not &s;trictly adhered to; many being ordained without the lea&s;t acquaintance with either of tho&s;e tongues. Formerly Latin was &s;olely u&s;ed, as well in the debates of the &s;ynod, as for the purpo&s;e of examining the candidates; but at pre&s;ent that tongue grows more and more into di&s;u&s;e, and German is employed in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>The number of reformed pari&s;hes in the whole three leagues amounts to 135. The mini&s;ters of the&s;e churches enjoy but very &s;mall &s;alaries. The riche&s;t benefices do not perhaps yield more than &pound;20, or at mo&s;t &pound;25 <HI>per annum,</HI> and the poore&s;t &s;ometimes &s;carcely &pound;6.</P>
<P>This &s;canty income is attended with many incon|veniences. It obliges the clergy, who have fami|lies, to follow &s;ome branch of traffic, to the neglect of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tudies, and to the degradation of the profe&s;&s;ional character. It was harve&s;t-time, (&s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> when he vi&s;ited this country) and I ob|&s;erved &s;everal clergymen employed in reaping the corn.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be conjectured that the general &s;tate of literature among the Gri&s;ons mu&s;t be at a very low ebb. The prote&s;tants, who receive a liberal
<PB N="72" REF="72">
education, repair chiefly to Zuric or Ba&s;le, and the catholics to Milan, Pavia, or Vienna.</P>
<P>Each community has a &s;mall &s;chool, in which the children are taught to read, write, and ca&s;t accounts; but which is only open in winter, from the 9th of November, to the 7th of March.</P>
<P>There is a Latin &s;eminary at Coire for the children of the burghers; and another, in&s;tituted in 1763, for the education of per&s;ons intended for the church; and although the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments are poorly en|dowed, yet they have been productive of &s;ome lite|rary advantages to the country.</P>
<P>The diet of the three leagues, which we have al|ready &s;aid to be compo&s;ed of 63 deputies, and the three chiefs of each league, a&s;&s;emble annually, about the beginning of September, at Ilants, Coire, and Davos, by rotation, the three principal places in each di&s;trict; and continue &s;itting about three weeks or a month. The chief of that league, in who&s;e di&s;trict the diet is held, is pre&s;ident for that turn, and has the ca&s;ting voice, in ca&s;e of equal &s;uffrages. The &s;upreme authority is not ab&s;olute|ly and finally ve&s;ted in the diet, but in the com|munities at large; for in all affairs of importance, &s;uch as declaring war, making peace, enacting laws,
<PB N="73" REF="73">
contracting alliances, and impo&s;ing taxes; the de|puties either bring po&s;itive in&s;tructions from their con&s;tituents, or refer tho&s;e points, concerning which they have no in&s;tructions, to the deci&s;ion of the &s;everal communities; &s;o that, in effect, the &s;upreme power con&s;titutionally re&s;ides in the body of the people, and not in their repre&s;entatives at the diet. The de|puties receive, for their attendance, a &s;mall &s;alary from the public trea&s;ury, which never exceeds five &s;hillings a day. Extraordinary diets are con|voked at the reque&s;t of any foreign court, who will di&s;charge the expence of its &s;ittings, and upon other important emergencies.</P>
<P>The three leagues are in clo&s;e alliance with the cantons of Berne and Zuric, to who&s;e mediation they have frequently had recour&s;e, in points of di&s;a|greement. They have al&s;o alliances with &s;everal of the other cantons, and in ca&s;e of inva&s;ion or rebellion, would be &s;upplied with &s;uccours from all the Swi&s;s republics.</P>
<P>The king of France maintains an envoy in this country, and has two Gri&s;on regiments in his &s;er|vice. Our court formerly had a mini&s;ter here, but for &s;ome time, the Engli&s;h Envoy to the Swi&s;s can|tons, re&s;ident at Berne, has tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s with this republic.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="74">Near the borders of the torrent Tamina, which runs into the Rhine, are &s;ome warm baths, which have been &s;o much renowned for their efficacy in curing the gout, rheumati&s;m, and cutaneous di&s;|orders. According, to the general opinion, they contain a &s;mall portion of gold; as if that metal would render them more &s;alutary for the cure of di&s;ea&s;es.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Va&s;&s;als of the Gri&s;ons.</HEAD>
<P>THESE con&s;i&s;t of three countries, which are able to bring into the field about 12,000 fighting men. Among them is,</P>
<P>The Valteline, called by the inhabitants Valle-Telina, and which extends from the confines of Bor|nio to the lake of Chiavenna, about the length of 50 miles. It is entirely enclo&s;ed between two chains of high mountains; the northern chain &s;eparates it from the Gri&s;ons, the &s;outhern from the Venetian territories; on the ea&s;t it borders on the county of Bormio; and on the we&s;t, on the Duchy of Milan.</P>
<P>The geographical divi&s;ion of the Valteline is di|vided into three principal di&s;tricts, and the political into five governments. Each of the five govern|ments is &s;ubject to a magi&s;trate, appointed by the Gri&s;ons, who is changed every two years. The magi&s;trate over the middle di&s;trict, is called Gover|nor
<PB N="76" REF="76">
of the Valteline, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, in &s;ome re&s;pect, a &s;uperior degree of authority to the others, who are &s;tyled pode&s;tas. He is al&s;o captain-general of the Valteline.</P>
<P>This country is exceedingly fruitful, and through|out its whole extent watered by the Adda; which, after receiving all the &s;treams i&s;&s;uing from the fore&s;t di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Como lake. The &s;un-beams &s;hine in every part of this country, and from the northern bla&s;ts it is fenced by high mountains. In &s;ome parts, however, the heat is inten&s;e, but in others more moderate; and on the hills, and the greate&s;t part of the adjacent vallies, the air is mo&s;tly cool. Of this variation in the temperature, the ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence is a variation in the products of the earth. The levels in this valley, through which the Adda pur&s;ues its meandering cour&s;e, and the breadth of which, in &s;ome parts, is not le&s;s than a mile, exhibit a delightful variety of corn-fields, meadows, vineyards, and orchards of che&s;nuts, and other fruits; and in one and the &s;ame year &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively, produce two, three, or even four kinds of the latter. The vineyards, on the mountains, to|wards the north, produce the be&s;t wine in the whole country; and above them are corn-fields, meadows, and pa&s;ture-lands. The hills, on the &s;outh-&s;ide, are covered with fine woods of che&s;nuts, fields,

meadows, and rich pa&s;tures, in which graze nume|rous breeds of cattle. This country al&s;o abounds in excellent red wine, of a mo&s;t delicious flavour, and of &s;o good a body that it will keep for a whole cen|tury, improving both in ta&s;te and whole&s;omene&s;s, and gradually turning paler, till at length its red|ne&s;s totally di&s;appears. Great quantities of this wine are exported.</P>
<P>The apples and pears in mo&s;t places here are not very de&s;irable, but its peaches, apricots, figs, and melons are exqui&s;ite. Here are likewi&s;e plenty of lemons, citrons, almonds, pomegranates, che&s;nuts, and other delicious fruits. Its &s;oil al&s;o would pro|duce all kinds of grain and pul&s;e; but the levels be|ing inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;wamps, which have remain|ed without culture, and the wine-trade chiefly en|gro&s;&s;ing the attention of the inhabitants, it does not yield a &s;ufficiency of corn for &s;o populous a coun|try, and they are under the nece&s;&s;ity of having re|cour&s;e to importation. Some parts grow hemp, and in the levels, particularly on the higher grounds, and the mountains, are fine pa&s;tures, notwith&s;tand|ing which graziery is but little followed. Bees and &s;ilk-worms are bred here in va&s;t numbers. Their game is much reduced by the avidity of the hunters. The Adda yields plenty of fi&s;h, and is noted for its
<PB N="78" REF="78">
trout, which are very fat and delicious, and &s;o large as to weigh from 50 to 60 lbs. The whole of their mine-works con&s;i&s;ts in a few iron-founderies.</P>
<P>This country is without &s;o much as one town, but has &s;ome con&s;iderable burghs, with many thriving villages. Its language is a corrupt kind of Italian. The population, according to <HI>Coxe,</HI> amounts to 62,000 &s;ouls.</P>
<P>There are no manufactures in the Valteline; and almo&s;t all the menial trades are exerci&s;ed by fo|reigners. Its chief commerce, which con&s;i&s;ts of wine and &s;ilk, is carried on with Milan and the Gri&s;ons. The&s;e two articles turn the balance of trade in its favour, and enable the inhabitants to exi&s;t without any manufacture.</P>
<P>Upon a rough calculation, 73,000 hor&s;e-loads of wine are annually exported, each of which may be e&s;timated at a pound &s;terling. Three thou&s;and lbs. of the fine&s;t &s;ort of &s;ilk, which is e&s;teemed as good as that procured from Piedmont, is &s;ent annually to England, by way of O&s;tend. The greate&s;t part of the &s;ilk is wound in the Valteline, for which purpo&s;e there are &s;ilk-mills in the principal di&s;|tricts.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="79">The tenants who take farms in this country do not pay their rent in money, but in kind; a &s;trong proof of general poverty. The pea&s;ant is at all the co&s;ts of cultivation, and delivers near half the pro|duce to the landholders.</P>
<P>The Valteline, from its neighbourhood to Italy, has imbibed a ta&s;te for the fine arts; and there are many collections of pictures which are not unwor|thy of notice. This country, however, has pro|duced few arti&s;ts of any eminence. <HI>Pietro Ligario</HI> is almo&s;t the only painter who de&s;erves to be men|tioned; and his name is &s;carcely known beyond the limits of the Valteline.</P>
<P>The romantic beauties of the Valteline, are greatly heightened by the numerous remains of ancient fortre&s;&s;es and ca&s;tles, &s;cattered throughout the country. They were all di&s;mantled &s;oon after the capitulation of Milan, in 1635, from a recent ex|perience that the inability of the Gri&s;ons to provide them with &s;ufficient garri&s;ons, expo&s;ed them to the enemy, and rendered them for the mo&s;t part, a &s;ource of annoyance, rather than of protection. It might be imagined, that &s;ome of the&s;e fortre&s;&s;es ought to have been retained, to awe the inhabitants: but &s;uch an ab&s;olute confidence is repo&s;ed by the Gri|&s;ons in the guaranty of the country by the hou&s;e of
<PB N="80" REF="80">
Au&s;tria, that they do not maintain a &s;ingle &s;oldier throughout the whole Valteline.</P>
<P>This country, Bormio, &s;ubject to the Gri&s;ons, lies at the foot, and in the mid&s;t of the Rhetian Alps, and borders upon Engadina, the Valteline, Tyrol, Trent, and the Venetian territories. It is, on all &s;ides, environed by &s;teep mountains, of &s;uch a &s;tu|pendous height, that their &s;ummits are very &s;eldom free from &s;now; except a narrow opening, which connects it with the Valteline. It was once a part of the Milane&s;e, and became &s;ubject to the Gri&s;ons in 1512. The inhabitants pay a fixed contribution to them which is very moderate, and cannot be in|crea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The air here is rather cold than warm, but yet pure and healthy. No wine is produced in this coun|try, and but little fruit. Of corn it has more than &s;uf|ficient for home-con&s;umption; and &s;uch is the rich|ne&s;s of its pa&s;tures, that the inhabitants keep be|tween 6 and 7000 cows, be&s;ides a great number of &s;heep and goats. The honey too of this country is particularly exqui&s;ite, and it abounds in iron ore; but its other metals and minerals are incon&s;iderable. The Adda has its &s;ource in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="81">The inhabitants, who amount to about 14,000, are papi&s;ts, and the exerci&s;e of every other wor&s;hip is prohibited. The prie&s;ts here have peculiar privi|leges, which extend even to tho&s;e who wear a clerical dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the pea&s;ants po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;mall portion of land; and, in con&s;equence of the freedom of the government, are much happier than the people of the Valteline and Chiavenna.</P>
<P>The town of Bormio, the capital, is not unplea|&s;antly &s;ituated, at the foot of the mountains, clo&s;e to the torrent Fredolfo, which falls, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, into the Adda. It contains about 1000 inhabitants, but has a de&s;olate appearance. The hou&s;es are of &s;tone, pla&s;tered; a few make a tolerable figure. Amid&s;t many with paper windows, &s;everal, like the Italian cottages, have only wooden &s;hutters. The palazzo, or town-hou&s;e, contains a &s;uit of wretched apartments for the re&s;idence of the pode&s;ta; a cham|ber for the courts of judicature; and an apartment, where the repre&s;entatives of the people a&s;&s;emble. In one of the rooms is an engine of torture, which, in defiance of common &s;en&s;e, as well as humanity, is &s;till u&s;ed in the&s;e countries, to force confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="82">The county of Chiavenna came under the &s;ove|reignty of the Gri&s;ons, in the &s;ame manner, and at rhe &s;ame time with the Valteline. It lies among high and &s;teep mountains, notwith&s;tanding which &s;ome of its vallies are of con&s;iderable extent. The &s;ummer-heats are frequently exce&s;&s;ive. Both the mountains and vallies are well peopled, and the country, in mo&s;t parts, be&s;ides pa&s;tures, abounds in all kinds of fruits and wines; and the culture of &s;ilk is a very important article. The inhabitants are papi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Chiavenna, the capital of the county, is &s;ituated at the foot, and upon the &s;ide of a mountain; and contains about 3000 &s;ouls. The inhabitants carry on but little commerce. The principal article of exportation is raw-&s;ilk. The great &s;upport of this town is the tran&s;port of merchandize between the Milane&s;e and Germany.</P>
<P>The principal object of curio&s;ity in the environs of Chiavenna is the fortre&s;s, in ruins, &s;eated upon the &s;ummit of a rock, which overlooks the town, and is celebrated, in the hi&s;tory of the Gri&s;ons, for its almo&s;t impregnable &s;trength. The only road which leads up to it is &s;teep and craggy. The walls occupy a large &s;pace of ground, and are now partly covered with vines. The &s;tronge&s;t part of the for|tre&s;s
<PB N="83" REF="83">
was con&s;tructed upon an in&s;ulated rock. It is on all &s;ides ab&s;olutely perpendicular, and its only communication with the ca&s;tle was by a draw-bridge, thrown acro&s;s the intervening cha&s;m. Its length is above 250 feet; its height above 200; and its greate&s;t di&s;tance from the adjoining rock about 20 feet.</P>
<P>This fortification, though always deemed im|pregnable, was taken, at different periods, &s;ome|times by a&s;&s;ault, but more frequently by famine, or &s;tratagem. It was finally demoli&s;hed by the Gri&s;ons them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Clo&s;e to Chiavenna is a rock of a&s;be&s;tos, a kind of mineral &s;ub&s;tance, of a greyi&s;h &s;ilver colour, which can be drawn out into longitudinal fibres, as fine as thread, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be inde&s;tructible by fire; the ancients manufactured it into a &s;pecies of cloth, re&s;embling linen. This &s;pecies of cloth is frequently mentioned by <HI>Pliny.</HI> It was princi|pally u&s;ed for &s;hrouds, in which the bodies of the great were enveloped, before they were placed upon the funeral pile; and which, not being liable to be con&s;umed by fire, pre&s;erved the a&s;hes of the body &s;eparate from tho&s;e of the wood. The art of weav|ing the a&s;be&s;tos into linen is not lo&s;t, as &s;ome authors have a&s;&s;erted; but, as it is very trouble&s;ome and
<PB N="84" REF="84">
expen&s;ive, and as the cu&s;tom of burning bodies, which gave it a value, is no longer in u&s;e, the ma|nufacture is di&s;continued. Be&s;ides the rock of a&s;|be&s;tos, ju&s;t mentioned, near Chiavenna, &s;everal mountains in the&s;e parts yield the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance. The be&s;t &s;ort is found in the valley of Malenco.</P>
<P>About four miles from Chiavenna is the &s;pot formerly occupied by the town of Piuro, or Plurs, which met with a fate &s;omething &s;imilar to that of Herculaneum, having been totally over|whelmed by the fall of mount Conto, under which it was built. This terrible cata&s;trophe happened Augu&s;t 25, 1618.</P>
<P>Plurs was a large and flouri&s;hing town; &s;ubject, as well as Chiavenna, to the Gri&s;ons. Contem|porary writers mention, that it contained three churches, many large hou&s;es, and a &s;tone bridge over the Maira; and that its population amounted to at lea&s;t 1500 inhabitants, who carried on no in|con&s;iderable commerce. The valley in which it was &s;ituated is very narrow, and the whole town was bu|ried in one undi&s;tingui&s;hed ruin. A contemporary account relates, that the cloud of du&s;t and rubbi&s;h was &s;o great as to cover the heavens like &s;moke; and even to extend as far as Chiavenna. The inha|bitants of Chiavenna, alarmed at this uncommon
<PB N="85" REF="85">
phenomena, were &s;till more terrified at the di&s;ap|pearance of the torrent Maira, which &s;uddenly cea&s;ed to flow by that town, for near an hour; its cour&s;e being &s;topped by the fallen fragments of rock, until it forced its way over the ruins. This event &s;pread &s;uch an univer&s;al alarm among the inhabi|tants, from an apprehen&s;ion that the torrent had un|dermined Chiavenna, and would bur&s;t out with &s;uch fury as to deluge the whole place; that great numbers fled precipitately into the mountains.</P>
<P>I walked over the &s;pot, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> where Pluro was built; part of the ancient walls, and the ruins of a country-hou&s;e, which belonged to the <HI>Franci,</HI> the riche&s;t family in the place, are the only remains of its former exi&s;tence; and the&s;e would not be no|ticed by a pa&s;&s;enger. A pea&s;ant who has a cottage clo&s;e to the ruins, pointed out to me every place, as it had been explained to him by his grandfather. He &s;hewed me where &s;tood the churches and princi|pal hou&s;es, the channel through which the river then flowed, and where the bridge was con&s;tructed. He informed me, that in digging, &s;everal dead bo|dies had been found; and particularly the bones of a prie&s;t, covered with &s;hreds of garment, which indicated that he was employed in divine &s;ervice when the rock overwhelmed the town. Hou&s;hold uten&s;ils are frequently dug up; the other day &s;everal
<PB N="86" REF="86">
corp&s;es were di&s;covered; and on the finger-bone of one were a &s;ilver and two gold rings. Vineyards, che&s;nut-trees, and hou&s;es, cover the &s;pot where this unfortunate town was once &s;ituated.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Vallais.</HEAD>
<P>THIS tract of country, called the Vallais, &s;tretches from ea&s;t to we&s;t, about 100 miles; and con|tains about 100,000 inhabitants, who all profe&s;s the Roman Catholic religion. The country is enclo&s;ed within high Alps; and, con&s;i&s;ting of plain, elevated vallies, and lofty mountains, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily exhi|bit a great variety of &s;ituations, climates and pro|ductions. Accordingly the Vallais pre&s;ents to the curious traveller a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pro&s;pects, as beautiful as they are diver&s;ified. Vineyards, rich pa&s;tures, covered with cattle; corn, flax, fruit-trees,
<PB N="87" REF="87">
and fore&s;ts, occa&s;ionally bordered by naked rocks, the &s;ummits of which are crowned with everla&s;ting &s;now.</P>
<P>As to the productions of the Vallais, they mu&s;t evidently vary, according to the great diver&s;ity of climates by which this country is &s;o peculiarly di&s;|tingui&s;hed. It &s;upplies more than &s;ufficient wine and corn for interior con&s;umption; and indeed a con&s;iderable quantity of both are yearly exported; the &s;oil in the midland and lower di&s;tricts being exceedingly rich and fertile. In the plain, where the heat is collected, and confined between the mountains, the harve&s;t is u&s;ually fini&s;hed in July; but, in the more elevated parts, barley is the only grain that can be cultivated with any &s;ucce&s;s; and the crop is &s;eldom cut before November. About Sion, the fig, the melon, and all the other fruits of Italy, come to perfection. In con&s;equence of this &s;ingular variety, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> I ta&s;ted, in the &s;ame day, &s;trawberries, cherries, plums, pears, and grapes, each of them the natural growth of the country.</P>
<P>This country is divided into Upper and Lower Vallais. The Upper Vallais is &s;overeign of the Lower Vallais, and comprizes &s;even independent commonwealths. The bi&s;hop of Sion was formerly ab&s;olute &s;overeign over the greate&s;t part of the Val|lais;
<PB N="88" REF="88">
but his authority is at pre&s;ent very much li|mited.</P>
<P>The republic of the Vallais, is an ally of the thir|teen cantons, and has formed a particular league with the &s;even catholic cantons, for the defence of their common religion.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to manufactures, there are none of any of con&s;equence, and indeed the general ignorance of the people is no le&s;s remarkable than their in|dolence, &s;o that they may be con&s;idered in regard to knowledge and improvements, as &s;ome centuries behind the Swi&s;s, who are certainly a very enlight|ened nation. The pea&s;ants &s;eldom endeavour to me|liorate tho&s;e lands, where the &s;oil is originally bad, nor to draw the mo&s;t advantage from tho&s;e, which are uncommonly fertile; having few wants, and being &s;atisfied with the &s;pontaneous gifts of nature, they enjoy her ble&s;&s;ings, without con&s;idering much, in what manner to improve them.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the Vallais, are very much &s;ubject to goiters, or large excre&s;&s;ences of fle&s;h that grow from the throat, and often encrea&s;e to a mo&s;t enormous &s;ize: but what is more extraordi|nary, idiocy al&s;o remarkably abounds among them. I &s;aw many in&s;tances of both kinds, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> as I
<PB N="89" REF="89">
pa&s;&s;ed through Sion, (capital of Vallais): &s;ome idiots even ba&s;king in the &s;un, with their tongues out, and their heads hanging down, exhibiting the mo&s;t affec|ting &s;pectacle of intellectual imbecility, that can po&s;|&s;ibly be conceived.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that the common people very much re|&s;pect the&s;e idiots, and even con&s;ider them as ble&s;|&s;ings. They call them Souls of God, without &s;in; and many parents prefer the&s;e idiot children, to tho&s;e who&s;e under&s;tandings are perfect; becau&s;e as they are incapable of intentional criminality, they con&s;i|der them as certain of happine&s;s in a future &s;tate. Nor is this opinion entirely without its good effect, as it di&s;po&s;es the parents to pay greater attention to &s;uch helple&s;s beings. Thus idiots are &s;uffered to marry, as well among them&s;elves, as with others.</P>
<P>The notion that &s;now-water occa&s;ions goiters, is certainly void of foundation, the&s;e guttural rumours are to be found in the environs of Naples, in the i&s;land of Sumatra, and at Patna and Purnea, in the Ea&s;t Indies, where &s;now is unknown. The primary cau&s;e of the&s;e excre&s;cences, are the &s;prings that &s;up|ply drink to the natives, and which are impregnated with a calcareous matter, called in Switzerland, <HI>tuf,</HI> nearly &s;imilar to the incru&s;tations of Matlock, in
<PB N="90" REF="90">
Derby&s;hire, where may be &s;een goitrous per&s;ons, as well as in Switzerland.</P>
<P>The pipes which convey water to the public foun|tain at Berne, are extremely clogged with this calca|reous &s;ediment; and a gentleman, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> on who&s;e &s;incerity I can depend, a&s;&s;ured me, that he is &s;ub|ject to a &s;mall &s;welling in the throat, which u&s;ually increa&s;es in winter, when he is chiefly re&s;ident at Berne, and dimini&s;hes in &s;ummer, on his removal to other places, where the waters are not loaded with <HI>tuf.</HI></P>
<P>I was al&s;o informed by General <HI>Biffer,</HI> &s;ays he, that at Lucerne, all waters, excepting one &s;pring, are im|pregnated with <HI>tuf,</HI> and that the natives who dwell near that &s;pring, are much le&s;s &s;ubject to goiters, than the other inhabitants; that the &s;ame difference is ob|&s;erved among the members of the &s;ame family; be|tween tho&s;e who drink no water, but what is drawn from that &s;pring, and others who do not u&s;e that precaution. The General &s;hewed me al&s;o the tin ve&s;&s;el, in which water was every morning boiled for his u&s;e, and which was &s;o &s;peedily and thickly in|cru&s;tated, as to render it nece&s;&s;ary to have it cleared twice a week. The water which yields this depo&s;i|tion, is as tran&s;parent as chry&s;tal.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="91">But a &s;till &s;tronger proof in favour of this opinion, is derived from the following facts: A &s;urgeon whom I met at the baths of Leuk, informed me, that he had not unfrequently extracted concretions of tuf-&s;tone from &s;everal goiters; and that from one in particular, which &s;uppurated, he had taken &s;everal flat pieces, each about half an inch long. He added, that the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance is found in the &s;tomachs of cows, and in the goitrous tumours to which even the dogs of the country are &s;ubject. The &s;ame gentle|man, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> a&s;&s;ured me, that in the cour&s;e of his exten&s;ive practice, he had dimini&s;hed and cured the goiters of many young per&s;ons by emollient liquors, and external applications; that his principal me|thod, in order to prevent them in future, con&s;i&s;ted in removing the patients from the places where the &s;prings are impregnated with tuf; and if that could not be contrived, by forbidding the u&s;e of water which was not purified. He remarked, that one of his own children, had at its birth, a goiter as large as an egg, although neither he, nor his wife, who were both foreigners, were afflicted with that malady. He had di&s;&s;ipated it by external remedies, and &s;ince that period, had invariably prohibited his family from ta&s;ting the &s;pring-waters, unle&s;s they were di&s;tilled, or mixed with wine and vinegar; by which means, he was able to pre&s;erve them from tho&s;e tu|mours in the throat, that were extremely common
<PB N="92" REF="92">
among the natives of the town which he inha|bited.</P>
<P><HI>M. de Sau&s;&s;ure,</HI> who&s;e accurate re&s;earches and profound inve&s;tigation on philo&s;ophical &s;ubjects, de|&s;erves to be weighed with great attention, attributes the production of goiters, not to the waters, but principally to the concentrated heat of the climate, and the &s;tagnation of the air. He informs us, that in all his travels through the Alpine countries, he never ob&s;erved goiters in any places which are elevated, more than between 3 or 4,000 feet above the level of the &s;ea; that he noticed them in tho&s;e vallies where the heat is concentrated, and the air &s;tagnated; and that they u&s;ually cea&s;e, wherever the valley terminates, and the country expands into a large plain. With great defference to his opinion, it may, however, be remarked, that in places con|&s;iderably elevated above the level of the &s;ea, the &s;prings are too near their &s;ources, to have di&s;&s;olved a &s;ufficient quantity of calcareous matter, as may be requi&s;ite for the generation of goiters.</P>
<P>The &s;ame cau&s;es which generate goiters, proba|bly operate in the ca&s;e of idiots: for whenever the former prevails to a con&s;iderable degree, the latter invariably abound. Such being the nice and inex|plicable connection between our bodies and our
<PB N="93" REF="93">
minds, that the one ever &s;ympathi&s;es with the other; it is by no means an ill-grounded conjecture, that the &s;ame cau&s;es which affect the body, &s;hould al&s;o affect the mind; or, in other words, that the &s;ame waters which create ob&s;tructions and goiters, &s;hould al&s;o occa&s;ion mental imbecillity and di&s;arrangement.</P>
<P>It is to be pre&s;umed, that a people accu&s;tomed to the&s;e excre&s;cences, will not be &s;hocked at their de|formity; but I do not find, adds <HI>Coxe,</HI> as &s;ome writers a&s;&s;ert, that they con&s;ider them as beauties. To judge from the accounts of many travellers, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the natives, without exception, were either idiots or goiters; but in fact, the Val|lai&s;ans in general, are a robu&s;t race; and all that with truth can be affirmed, is, that goitrous per&s;ons and idiots, are more abundant in &s;ome di&s;tricts of the Vallais, than perhaps in any other part of the globe.</P>
<P>Sion is the principal town in this canton, and that not of any note; it was formerly the capital of the Seduni, who inhabited this part of the country, in the time of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI> It is here that the Diet a&s;&s;embles. On &s;eeing the apartments where they meet, I was greatly &s;truck with their plainne&s;s, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> and could not avoid reflecting with plea&s;ure, on the &s;implicity of manners, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily
<PB N="94" REF="94">
prevail in this country; when the rooms inha|bited by the &s;overeign, in&s;tead of be&s;peaking the magnificence of a court, are &s;carcely &s;uperior to the dwelling of a pea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Leuk is another &s;mall town, or rather village, in this canton, built upon an eminence near the Rhone, and famous for its hot medicinal &s;prings: it is much frequented during the &s;ummer, by invalids of vari|ous kinds: the patients either bathe or drink the waters.</P>
<P>The accommodations for company, are very incon|venient: each per&s;on having for his own u&s;e, a &s;mall apartment, not more than a few feet &s;quare, in which there is ju&s;t room for a bed, a table, and two chairs. The public dining-room, is upon rather a larger &s;cale, as is al&s;o an apartment where the com|pany occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;emble. Formerly, the accommo|dations were tolerably good; but unfortunately, in 1719, an <HI>avalanche</HI> fell with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity from a neigh|bouring glacier, upon the village, as to overwhelm the greate&s;t part of the hou&s;es, and the baths, and to de&s;troy a con&s;iderable number of the inhabitants. The <HI>avalanche</HI> is a large body of &s;now, which pre|cipitates it&s;elf from the top of a mountain, with a noi&s;e like the &s;ound of thunder, and in its de&s;cent, has the appearance of a torrent of water, reduced
<PB N="95" REF="95">
almo&s;t into &s;pray. The <HI>avalanches,</HI> (as they are called) are &s;ometimes attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences; for where they con&s;i&s;t of enormous ma&s;&s;es, they de&s;troy every thing in their cour&s;e; and not unfrequently, as in the ca&s;e of Leuk, overwhelm even whole villages. The be&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t their effects, being the fore&s;ts, with which the Alps abound, there is &s;carcely a village, if &s;ituated at the foot of a mountain, that is not &s;heltered by trees; which the inhabitants pre&s;erve with uncommon re|verence. Thus what con&s;titutes one of the princi|pal beauties in the country, affords al&s;o &s;ecurity to the people.</P>
<P>As far as I can judge, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> &s;peaking of the&s;e waters, from the accounts which I have received, concerning their warmth, their analy&s;is, the method of u&s;ing them, and their efficacy in curing the gout, rheumati&s;m, ob&s;tructions, and cutaneous di&s;orders; they &s;eem nearly to re&s;emble tho&s;e of Bath.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation is much more romantic, and the waters perhaps not le&s;s efficacious; and yet this village contains only a few mi&s;erable hou&s;es, whil&s;t Bath is one of the fine&s;t towns in Europe. I had a conver&s;ation on this topic, with a very ingenious and well-informed gentleman of the Vallais: and ob|&s;erved
<PB N="96" REF="96">
to him, that con&s;idering the great credit and efficacy of the&s;e waters, I could not forbear wonder|ing that the chiefs of the republic had not con&s;i|dered the improvement of the accommodations, an object worthy of their attention; for, if they were rendered more convenient for the reception of inva|lids, it would be the means of drawing a great num|ber of &s;trangers; and mu&s;t be highly beneficial to the country. He a&s;&s;ured me, that it had been more than once in contemplation; that &s;ome per&s;ons of great credit and authority, oppo&s;ed all improve|ments upon a principle, &s;imilar to the policy of <HI>Lycurgus;</HI> conceiving that a concour&s;e of &s;trangers would only &s;erve to introduce luxury among the inhabitants, and in&s;en&s;ibly de&s;troy that &s;implicity of manners, for which the Vallai&s;ans are &s;o remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Geneva.</HEAD>
<P>THIS city placed in the confines of France, of Savoy, and of Switzerland, and properly be|longing to none of the&s;e, ought not to be omitted. Its territory is incon&s;iderable, for the &s;pace within its walls forms the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the re|public.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of this little capital, on the borders of the lake Leman, is delightful; the pro&s;pects around it are rich and variegated; the country is admirably cultivated, and the horizon is bounded by the maje&s;tic &s;cenery of the Alps, Mount Blanc, and the chain of Jura.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the town, &s;tands upon a hill, and has its views bounded on all &s;ides, by &s;everal ranges of mountains, which are, however, at &s;o great
<PB N="98" REF="99">
a di&s;tance, that they leave open a wonderful variety of fine pro&s;pects. The &s;ituation of the&s;e mountains, has &s;ome particular effects on the country which they enclo&s;e. At fir&s;t, they cover it from all winds, except the north and &s;outh. 'Tis to the la&s;t of the&s;e winds, that the inhabitants of Geneva a&s;cribe the healthfulne&s;s of the air; for as the Alps &s;urround them on all &s;ides, they form a va&s;t kind of ba&s;on, where there would be a con&s;tant &s;tagnation of va|pours, the country being &s;o well watered, did not the north wind put them in motion, and &s;catter them from time to time. Another effect the Alps have on Geneva, is, that the &s;un here ri&s;es later, and &s;ets &s;ooner, than it does in other places of the &s;ame la|titude. I have often ob&s;erved, &s;ays <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> that the top of the neighbouring mountains have been covered with light above half an hour after the &s;un is down, vi&s;ible to tho&s;e who live at Geneva. The&s;e mountains like|wi&s;e, very much increa&s;e their &s;ummer heats, and make up an horizon that has &s;omething in it very &s;ingular and agreeable. On one &s;ide, is the long tract of hills, that goes under the name of Mount Jura, and covered with vineyards and pa&s;turage, and on the other, huge precipices of naked rocks, ri&s;ing up in a thou&s;and odd figures, and cleft in &s;ome places, &s;o as to di&s;cover high mountains of &s;now, that lie &s;everal leagues behind them. Towards the &s;outh, the hills ri&s;e more in&s;en&s;ibly, and leave the eye
<PB N="99" REF="100">
a va&s;t uninterrupted pro&s;pect for many miles. But the mo&s;t beautiful view of all, is the lake, and the borders that lie north of the town.</P>
<P>This city, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;sley,</HI> is remarkable for its &s;itu|ation, independence, religion, and commerce: for|merly it &s;tood only on that hill, which is the key of lake Leman, at the part where the Rhone i&s;&s;ues out of that lake; and this river was its principal de|fence: like all ancient towns built on mountains, it has gradually &s;unk down into the level, &s;o that the afflux of the Rhone is now within its circuit. In its primitive &s;ituation, it enjoyed a very healthy air, with a view of the whole lake, which it com|manded, and at the &s;ame time, all the advantages ari&s;ing from the lake, either for the nece&s;&s;aries of life, or the convenience of trade; but by removing into the level, it has lo&s;t the defence of the Rhone, and plunged it&s;elf amid&s;t the continual fogs and vapours of the lake.</P>
<P>Geneva is by far the mo&s;t populous town in Swit|zerland; and contains 24,000 &s;ouls. This &s;uperio|rity of numbers, is undoubtedly owing to the great indu&s;try and activity of the inhabitants; to its more exten&s;ive commerce; to the facility of purcha&s;ing the burgher&s;hip; and to the privileges which go|vernment allows to all foreigners.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="101">The liberal policy of this government, in receiv|ing &s;trangers, and conferring the burgher&s;hip on them, is the more remarkable, as it is contrary to the &s;pirit and u&s;age of the Swi&s;s. It is here, indeed, more nece&s;&s;ary; the territory of the &s;tate being &s;o exceedingly &s;mall, that its very exi&s;tence depends upon the number and indu&s;try of the people; for exclu&s;ive of the city, there are &s;carcely 16,000 &s;ouls in the whole di&s;trict of the Genevois.</P>
<P>To a man of letters, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> Geneva is par|ticularly intere&s;ting: learning is diverted of pedan|try and philo&s;ophy, and united with a knowledge of the world. The plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, are mixed with the pur&s;uits of literature; and elegance and ur|banity give a ze&s;t to the profounde&s;t di&s;qui&s;itions. Nor are letters confined in this city, merely to tho&s;e who engage in them as a profe&s;&s;ion, or to tho&s;e who&s;e fortune and lei&s;ure enable them to follow, where genius leads. Even the lower cla&s;s of people, are exceedingly well informed; and there is perhaps no city in Europe, where luxury is more univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed. We are at fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed, adds the above writer, to find in this cla&s;s of men, &s;o uncommon a &s;hare of knowledge. But the wonder cea&s;es, when we are told that all of them were educated at the public academy, where the children of the citizens
<PB N="101" REF="102">
are taught, under the in&s;pection of the magi&s;trates, and at the expence of government.</P>
<P>The citizens enjoy al&s;o the advantage of having acce&s;s to the public library; and by this privilege, they not only retain, but improve that general tinc|ture of learning, which they imbibe in their early youth.</P>
<P>This library contains 25,000 volumes of many curious manu&s;cripts, of which, an accurate and learned catalogue has been lately publi&s;hed by the Rev. <HI>M. Sennebier,</HI> the librarian. He has attempted to determine the ages of the &s;everal manu&s;cripts, he de&s;cribes their form and &s;ize, the materials on which they are written, the ornaments, the characteri&s;tic phra&s;es, and mentions the proofs on which he grounds the opinion. He adds al&s;o the notes, and di&s;tingui&s;hes tho&s;e which have never been printed.</P>
<P>The &s;treets are in general wide, clean, and well paved: the principal &s;treet, however, is encum|bered with a row of &s;hops on each &s;ide, between the carriage and foot-way; which la&s;t, is very wide, and protected from the weather, by great wooden pent-hou&s;es, projecting from the roofs; the&s;e are very convenient, but give the &s;treet a dark and dull ap|pearance. The hou&s;es are generally built of free-&s;tone,
<PB N="102" REF="103">
with lime &s;tone ba&s;ements: the gutters, &s;pouts, ridges, and outward ornaments, are of <HI>fer blanc,</HI> which we improperly call tin.</P>
<P>The mai&s;on de ville, or town-hou&s;e, is a large, plain, ancient building; with great rooms for the council to a&s;&s;emble in, and for public entertain|ments; in one of them, there is a weekly concert by &s;ub&s;cription, during the winter &s;ea&s;o. The a&s;cent to the upper &s;tory, is not by &s;teps, but by a paved &s;lope, &s;o gentle, that hor&s;es and mules ea&s;ily go up and down.</P>
<P>There are five churches here, be&s;ides French, Ita|lian, and German chapels; none of them, however, have any thing to attract attention, except <HI>S. Peter's,</HI> formerly the cathedral. This is an ancient gothic building, with a modern portico of &s;even large co|lumns of red and white marble, and of the Corinthi|an order. The in&s;ide is plain, and the only thing ob&s;ervable, is the tomb of <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of Rohan.</P>
<P>The ar&s;enal is in good order, and furni&s;hed with arms for 12,000 men. Here are al&s;o many ancient &s;uits of armour, and the &s;caling ladders, lanthorns, hatchets, &s;tandards, &amp;c. recall to the friends of li|berty, the abortive attempt of the Savoyards upon
<PB N="103" REF="104">
the city, in the year 1602. In the magazine, they they have 110 cannons and mortars.</P>
<P>The ho&s;pital is a large, hand&s;ome building. Near 4,000 poor are maintained by this and the French pur&s;e.</P>
<P>The public fountains are &s;upplied by an hydraulic machine, which rai&s;es the water from the river, above 100 Paris feet.</P>
<P>The Treille, or public walks, con&s;i&s;ts of lime-trees, and being on an eminence, affords a charming pro&s;pect of the large gardens beneath it, and of the fields and meadows towards the mountains. One of the mo&s;t &s;tately hou&s;es, of which there are &s;eve|ral very magnificent fronting the&s;e walls, formerly belonged to an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and is &s;aid to have co&s;t him near 20,000 pounds.</P>
<P>The fortifications are in the modern &s;tyle on the &s;ide of Savoy, but are commanded by &s;ome of the neighbouring ground. On the &s;ide of France, they are old fa&s;hioned. They are calculated rather to pre|vent a &s;urprize, than to &s;u&s;tain a regular &s;iege. They have three gates towards France, Savoy, and Switzerland. All acce&s;s by the lake is barred by a double jettee and chain. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of
<PB N="104" REF="105">
720 men, Swi&s;s, or Germans. A guard of four com|panies is changed every day at noon, one of the &s;yndics giving the word of command. One com|pany does duty at each gate, and the fourth mounts guard at the town-hall.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not omit ob&s;erving, that Geneva has partly realized <HI>Swift's</HI> project, in his great my&s;tery, or art of meditating in a hou&s;e of office. On that part of the lake which faces the upper town, very large ea&s;ements have been lately built, divided into &s;eats, with &s;light partitions on each &s;ide, mo&s;t of them about elbow high, as Doctor <HI>Swift</HI> directs, for the convenience of conver&s;ation. I went there, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;sley,</HI> one morning, and taking my &s;eat in the centre, &s;hared in a very &s;prightly conver&s;ation, among &s;everal women, &s;ome of whom were bu&s;y, and others waiting their turn.</P>
<P>Since the late troubles, a theatre has been built within the city. The only public diver&s;ions be&s;ides this, are two concerts. Private balls are not un|frequent, and plays are &s;ometimes performed by gentlemen and ladies. The chief amu&s;ement is cards, at which the women con&s;tantly play in their &s;ocieties and a&s;&s;emblies. In fine weather, there is a great re&s;ort to the Treille, and other public walks.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="106">The dre&s;s of the men at Geneva, is chiefly broad cloth, without lace or trimmings, except frogs; that of the women, is &s;ilk in winter, and printed cotton, which they call <HI>Indiennes</HI> in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>The revenues of government, are about 500,000 French livres, or little more than 20,000 pounds &s;terling. This is rai&s;ed from the domains of the &s;tate, tenths, quit-rents, fines, or alienations, a tax on per&s;onaal effects, a poll-tax, cu&s;toms and duties on goods, entering or pa&s;&s;ing through the city, to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls at bridges, &amp;c. The &s;alaries of the &s;yndics, are between 70 and 80 pounds. Members of the little council have 45 pounds. The garri&s;on co&s;ts 130,000 livres. Repairs of the public buildings, fortifications and roads, charges of the police, &amp;c. make up the re&s;t of the annual expences.</P>
<P>The government is of a mixed kind: the legi&s;la|tive power re&s;ides in the general a&s;&s;embly of the citizens; con&s;i&s;ting of about 1500: the executive, in the magi&s;trates, who con&s;i&s;t of a council of 24, which nominates the moiety of the grand-council, out of which four &s;yndics are annually cho&s;en by the general a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The law of the &s;tate, is the Roman law, with &s;ome modifications: they have not titles of nobility, or hereditary dignities.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="107">For the &s;upport of credit, it is enacted by an ex|pre&s;s law, that no &s;on who does not di&s;charge his fathers debts, &s;hall be capable of any office.</P>
<P>Geneva al&s;o has &s;ome peculiar ordinances con|cerning matrimony. No marriage is allowed of, unle&s;s both parties be of the prote&s;tant religion; all previous promi&s;es or engagements of a <HI>reformed,</HI> with a <HI>Roman Catholic,</HI> are declared void, and of none effect; and the agents of tho&s;e who have given their con&s;ent to it, are puni&s;hable, according to the nature of the circum&s;tances. A woman of 40 years of age, cannot marry a man who is ten years younger than her&s;elf; if above 40, her choice is confined to five years younger. A man of 60, is not to marry a woman who is not at lea&s;t half that age. A widow mu&s;t remain &s;uch at lea&s;t &s;ix months before &s;he can alter her condition. In this point, a man is not limited to any particular time; but, however, he is enjoined to wait a rea&s;onable time, with this &s;ingular addition, which is not found in other laws, "Both to obviate &s;candal, and to &s;hew that he hath felt the hand of God."</P>
<P>The maintenance of a good police, and the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of luxury, is the province of a particular court; but a very extraordinary fund here, is that ari&s;ing from the dirt of the &s;treets. In other places,
<PB N="107" REF="108">
money is payed for carrying it away, whereas, here it is farmed for 800 livres, paid to the city for the exclu&s;ive privilege of taking it away for manuring land.</P>
<P>It is the cu&s;tom in Geneva and Switzerland, for men to divide their e&s;tates equally among all their children, by which means, every one lives at his ea&s;e, without growing dangerous to the republic; for as &s;oon as an overgrown e&s;tate falls into the hands of one that has many children, it is broken into &s;o many por|tions, as render the &s;hares of it rich enough, with|out rai&s;ing them too much above the level of the re&s;t. This is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the&s;e little re|publics, where the rich merchants live very much within their e&s;tates, and by heaping up va&s;t &s;ums from year to year, might become formidable to their fellow-citizens, and break the equality, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in the&s;e kinds of governments, were there not means found out to di&s;tribute their wealth among &s;everal members of their republic. At Geneva for in&s;tance, are merchants worth 100,000 pounds, though perhaps, there is not one of them who &s;pends to the value of 500 pounds a year.</P>
<P>Geneva has but little land belonging to it, &s;o that the corn it yields, not being &s;ufficient for &s;upplying the inhabitants of the republic; and the regular im|portation
<PB N="108" REF="109">
of it from the neighbouring countries, being liable to be interrupted by bad harve&s;ts, con|tagious di&s;tempers, or wars; for preventing a &s;carcity, large granaries have been built at the pub|lic expence. In the&s;e are continually kept 90,000 quintals of corn, which is computed to &s;uffice for two years. But no per&s;on is obliged to purcha&s;e their corn from this &s;tore-hou&s;e, as at Rome, where every one mu&s;t repair to his Holine&s;s's granary, who &s;ells the corn at double the price it co&s;t; and who|ever has corn to di&s;po&s;e of, mu&s;t deliver it in at a very unrea&s;onable low rate. Bakers, inn-keepers, the garri&s;on, the city-artificers, and labourers em|ployed by the city, are the only per&s;ons under any obligation to provide them&s;elves with corn from the republic of Geneva's granary. This con&s;umption takes off yearly, about 16,000 quintals; and the in|tent of it is not &s;o much the &s;mall gain which accrues to the city from a very moderate advance of the price, but thus by regularly giving out the corn every &s;ix years, the entire &s;tock is removed.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> Of the Character, Manners, and Cu&s;toms of the Citizens of Geneva.</HEAD>
<P>THEY told me here, &s;ays <HI>Sherlock,</HI> that all the girls were cha&s;te, and I believed them, for I am naturally a very credulous man. There are &s;ome rea&s;ons which might tempt a traveller, le&s;s &s;imple than my&s;elf, to &s;u&s;pect the contrary. There is no playhou&s;e, nor any public amu&s;ement in the city of Geneva; and reading is the only re&s;ource again&s;t <HI>ennui.</HI> In con&s;equence of this, a number of book|&s;ellers lend books by the month, at a very low price. The fir&s;t acquaintance I generally make in a town, is that of a book&s;eller; and during half an hour that I was talking with one, the day after my arrival there, in came three girls, one after another, to hire the <HI>New Heloi&s;e.</HI> Pray, &s;aid I, to the book|&s;eller, what is the general reading of this country? Young people, &s;ays he, like books with fine &s;enti|ments; women a little mature, prefer tho&s;e which are light and brilliant. He appeared to me, to have unfolded his nation by this trait; the girls all ena|moured
<PB N="110" REF="111">
of <HI>Rou&s;&s;eau,</HI> the women all admirers of <HI>Voltaire.</HI> Yes, thought I, the thing is clear; they begin, by imitating <HI>Eloi&s;a;</HI> and when their <HI>S. Preux</HI> for&s;akes them, or the devil begins to frighten them, they read <HI>Voltaire</HI> to give them courage and &s;pirits. By no means&mdash;I gue&s;&s;ed like a fool. The girls are all virtuous; there never was one &s;u&s;pected; and what makes this miracle &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing, is, that they have leave to go out by them&s;elves in the morning, and they avail them&s;elves of it every day.</P>
<P>The Geneve&s;e thinks, that he is &s;omewhat like the ancient Romans, as a petty prince in Germany thinks he re&s;embles <HI>Lewis</HI> the Fourteenth. The trade&s;man of this country, is of all men, he who impo&s;ed upon me mo&s;t; and he cheats with an in&s;olence, equal to his ba&s;ene&s;s. I &s;aw few people of the fir&s;t cla&s;s; but tho&s;e I did &s;ee, appeared to me amiable, &s;en&s;ible, and well informed. The men in general, wi&s;h to pa&s;s for wits; the women, for free-thinkers. Such are <HI>Sherlock's</HI> conci&s;e remarks on the manners of the inhabitants in this little republic.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation of the Geneve&s;e in general, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;sley,</HI> has more of the German in it, than of the French: among men, it is carried on in clubs, who hire a chamber, where they re&s;ort in an evening, to
<PB N="111" REF="112">
&s;moke, talk politics, and chat about their private concerns, and the news of the city. The Italian re|&s;erve, and German phlegm, prevail in their conver|&s;ation, not only among them&s;elves, but with fo|reigners; if &s;ome few have any tincture of French manners, it is by imitating the politene&s;s of the in|habitants of Dauphin&eacute;. But how ill they &s;ucceed in their attempts to imitate the manners of the French, or even the Engli&s;h, the following hu|mourous dialogue, which <HI>Moore</HI> had with a French hair-dre&s;&s;er at Geneva, will &s;ufficiently &s;hew. A very genteel young man, a Genevois, happened t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> call on me, &s;ays this writer, while a French <HI>fri&s;eur</HI> was with me. The young gentleman had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at Paris, and was dre&s;&s;ed exactly in the Pari&s;ian ta&s;te.

<P><HI>'"Mon dieu! quelle difference,"</HI> cried the fri&s;eur.

<P>"Did you ever &s;ee an Engli&s;hman," &s;aid I, "who might pa&s;s for a Frenchman?" <HI>"Jamais de la vie,"</HI> replied he with an accent of a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="113">"Suppo&s;e him," &s;aid I, "a man of quality?" <HI>N'importe.</HI>"</P>
<P>"But," continued I, "&s;uppo&s;e he had lived &s;e|veral years at Paris, that he was naturally very hand|&s;ome, and well made, that he had been educated by the be&s;t French dancing ma&s;ter, his clothes made by the be&s;t French taylor, and his hair dre&s;&s;ed by the mo&s;t eminent fri&s;eur in Paris?" <HI>"Ce&s;t beaucoup, Mon&s;ieur, mais ce n'e&s;t pas a&s;&s;ez."</HI></P>

<P>As education here, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> in his account of their cu&s;toms and manners, is equally cheap and liberal, the citizens of Geneva of both &s;exes, are remarkably well in&s;tructed. No country in the world, can perhaps produce an equal number of
<PB N="113" REF="114">
per&s;ons, taken collectively from all cla&s;&s;es and pro|fe&s;&s;ions, with minds &s;o much cultivated, as the in|habitants of Geneva po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon to find mechanics, in the in|tervals of their labour, amu&s;ing them&s;elves with the works of <HI>Locke, Monte&s;quieu,</HI> and other productions of the &s;ame kind. The clergy of Geneva, in gene|ral, are men of &s;en&s;e, learning, and moderation, im|pre&s;&s;ing upon the minds of their hearers the tenets of Chri&s;tianity, with all the grace of pulpit-eloquence; and illu&s;trating the efficacy of the doctrine by their conduct in life. The people of every &s;tation, in this place, attend &s;ermons and the public wor&s;hip, with remarkable punctuality. The Sunday is honoured with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful decorum, during the hours of divine &s;ervice; but, as &s;oon as that is over, all the u&s;ual amu&s;ements commence.</P>
<P>The public walks are crowded by all degrees of people, in their be&s;t dre&s;&s;es. The different &s;ocie|ties, and what they call <HI>circles,</HI> a&s;&s;emble in the hou&s;es and gardens of individuals. They play at cards and at bowls, and have parties upon the lake, with mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>There is one cu&s;tom univer&s;al here, which, per|haps, is peculiar to this town. The parents form
<PB N="114" REF="115">
&s;ocieties for their children at a very early period of their lives. The&s;e &s;ocieties con&s;i&s;t of 10, 12, or more children, of the &s;ame age, and &s;ituation in life. They a&s;&s;emble once a week, in the hou&s;es of the different parents, who entertain the company by turns, with tea, coffee, bi&s;cuits, and fruit; and then leave the young a&s;&s;embly to the freedom of their own conver&s;ation. This connection is &s;trictly kept up through life, whatever alterations may take place in the &s;ituations or circum&s;tances of the individuals; and although they &s;hould afterwards form new or preferable intimacies, they never entirely abandon this &s;ociety; but to the late&s;t periods of their lives, continue to pa&s;s a few evenings every year with the companions of their youth, and their earlie&s;t friends.</P>
<P>The richer cla&s;s of the citizens have country-hou&s;es adjacent to the town, where they pa&s;s one half of the year. The&s;e hou&s;es are, all of them, neat; and &s;ome of them &s;plendid. One piece of magnificence they po&s;&s;e&s;s in greater perfection than the mo&s;t &s;u|perb villa of the greate&s;t lord in any other part of the world can boa&s;t; that is, the pro&s;pect which al|mo&s;t all of them command. The gardens and vine|yards of the republic;&mdash;the Pays de Vaud;&mdash;Ge|neva, with its lake;&mdash;innumerable country-&s;eats, ca&s;tles, and little towns, round the lake;&mdash;the val|lies
<PB N="115" REF="116">
of Savoy, and the loftie&s;t mountains of the Alps, all within one &s;weep of the eye.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who&s;e fortunes or employments do not per|mit them to pa&s;s the &s;ummer in the country, make frequent parties of plea&s;ure upon the lake; and dine, and &s;pend the evening at &s;ome of the villages in the environs, where they amu&s;e them&s;elves with mu&s;ic and dancing.</P>
<P>Sometimes they form them&s;elves into circles con|&s;i&s;ting of 40 or 50 per&s;ons, and purcha&s;e or hire a hou&s;e and gardens near the town, where they a&s;&s;em|ble every afternoon during the &s;ummer, drink coffee, lemonade, and other refre&s;hing liquors; and amu&s;e them&s;elves with cards, conver&s;ation, and playing at bowls; a game very different from that which goes by the &s;ame name in England; for here, in&s;tead of a &s;mooth, level green, they often choo&s;e the roughe&s;t, and mo&s;t unequal piece of ground. The player, in&s;tead of rolling the bowl, throws it in &s;uch a manner that it re&s;ts in the place where it fir&s;t touches the ground; and if that be a fortunate &s;ituation, the next player pitches his bowl directly on his adver|&s;ary's, &s;o as to make that &s;pring away, while his own fixes it&s;elf in the &s;pot from which the other has been di&s;lodged. Some of the citizens are a&s;toni&s;hingly dexterous at this game, which is more complicated
<PB N="116" REF="117">
and intere&s;ting than the Engli&s;h manner of playing. They generally continue their circle till the du&s;k of the evening, and the &s;ound of the drum from the ramparts calls to the town; and at that time the gates are &s;hut, after which no per&s;on can enter or go out; the officer of the guard not having the power to open them, without an order from the &s;yndics which is not to be attained but on &s;ome great emer|gency.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom had its ri&s;e ever &s;ince the year 1602, when the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> made an attempt to &s;eize upon the town. He marched an army, in the mid|dle of a dark night, in the time of peace, to the gates, applied &s;caling-ladders to the ramparts and walls; and having &s;urpri&s;ed the centinels, &s;everal hundred of the Savoyard &s;oldiers had actually got into the town, and the re&s;t were following, when they were at length di&s;covered by a woman, who gave the alarm.</P>
<P>The Genevoi&s;e &s;tarted from their &s;leep, &s;eized the readie&s;t arms they could find, attacked the a&s;&s;ailants with &s;pirit and energy, killed numbers in the &s;treets, drove them out of the gates, or tumbled them over the ramparts; and the few who were taken pri|&s;oners, they beheaded next morning, without further proce&s;s or ceremony.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="118">The Geneve&s;e annually di&s;tingui&s;h the day on which this memorable exploit was performed, as a day of public thank&s;giving and rejoicing.</P>
<P>It is called, <HI>le jour de l'e&s;calade.</HI> There is divine wor&s;hip in all the churches. The clergymen, on this occa&s;ion, after &s;ermon, recapitulate all the cir|cum&s;tances of this intere&s;ting event; put the audi|ence in mind of the gratitude they owe to Divine Providence, and to the valour of their ance&s;tors, which &s;aved them in &s;o remarkable a manner from civil and religious bondage; enumerate the peculiar ble&s;&s;ings which they enjoy, and exhort them, in the mo&s;t pathetic &s;train, to watch over their liberties, remain &s;teady in their religion, and tran&s;mit the&s;e, and all their other advantages, unimpaired to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The evening of this day is &s;pent in vi&s;iting, fea&s;t|ing, dancing, and all kinds of diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>Though the &s;tate keeps in pay a body of merce|naries, they do not tru&s;t the &s;afety of the republic to the&s;e alone. All citizens of Geneva are &s;oldiers. They are exerci&s;ed &s;everal hours daily, for two months every &s;ummer, during which time they wear their uniforms, and at the end of that period are re|viewed by the &s;yndics.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="119">Geneva, like all free &s;tates, is expo&s;ed to party-rage, and the public harmony is frequently interrupt|ed by political &s;quabbles. One part of the citizens are accu&s;ed of wi&s;hing to throw all the power into the hands of a few families, and of e&s;tabli&s;hing a complete ari&s;tocracy. The other oppo&s;es every mea&s;ure which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have that tendency; and by their adver&s;aries are accu&s;ed of &s;editious de|&s;igns.</P>
<P>It is difficult for &s;trangers, who re&s;ide any con|&s;iderable time at Geneva, to ob&s;erve a &s;trict neu|trality. The Engli&s;h, in particular, are exceedingly di&s;po&s;ed to take part with one &s;ide or other. Among the citizens, them&s;elves, political alterca|tions are carried on with great fire and &s;pirit. A worthy old gentleman, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> in who&s;e hou&s;e I had been often entertained with great ho&s;pitality, declaiming warmly again&s;t certain mea&s;ures of the council, a&s;&s;erted, that all tho&s;e who had promoted them merited death; and if it depended on him they &s;hould all be hanged without lo&s;s of time. His brother, who was in that predicament, interrupted him, and &s;aid, in a tone of voice which &s;eemed to beg for mercy, Good brother! &s;urely you would not pu&s;h your re&s;entment &s;o far!&mdash;You would not actually hang them! Yes, certainly; replied the patriot, with a determined countenance, and you,
<PB N="119" REF="120">
my dear brother, &s;hould be hung fir&s;t, to &s;hew my impartiality.</P>
<P>Although this republic has long continued in a profound peace, and there is no probability of its being &s;oon engaged in any bloody conflict, yet the citizens of Geneva are not the le&s;s fond of the pomp of war.</P>
<P>This appears in what they call their military fea&s;ts, which are their mo&s;t favourite amu&s;ements, and which they take every opportunity of enjoying. I was pre&s;ent, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> at a very grand entertain|ment of this kind, which was given by the King of of the Arquebu&s;iers, upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the royal dignity. This envied rank is neither tran&s;mitted by hereditary right, nor obtained by election; but gained by &s;kill and real merit.</P>
<P>A war with this &s;tate, like the war of Troy, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily con&s;i&s;t of a &s;iege. The &s;kilful u&s;e of the cannon and arquebu&s;e, is therefore thought to be of the greate&s;t importance. During &s;everal months every year, a con&s;iderable number of the ci|tizens are almo&s;t con&s;tantly employed in firing at a mark, placed at a proper di&s;tance. Any citizen has a right, at a &s;mall expence, to make trial of his &s;kill
<PB N="120" REF="121">
in this way; and, after a due number of trials, the mo&s;t expert mark&s;man is declared king.</P>
<P>There has not been a coronation of this kind the&s;e ten years, his late Maje&s;ty having kept peace|able po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne during that period. But at la&s;t, another per&s;on was found to excel in &s;kill every competitor; and was rai&s;ed to the throne by the unanimous voice of the judges. He was at|tended to his own hou&s;e from the field of con|te&s;t, by the &s;yndics, amid&s;t the acclamation of the people. Some time after this, on the day of his fea&s;t, a camp was formed on a plain, without the gates of the city. Here the whole forces of the repub|lic, both hor&s;e and foot, were a&s;&s;embled and di|vided into two di&s;tinct armies. They were to perform a battle in honour of his Maje&s;ty, all the combatants having previou&s;ly &s;tudied their parts. This very ingenious, warlike drama had been com|po&s;ed by one of the reverend mini&s;ters, who is &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s a very exten&s;ive military genius. That the ladies, and people of di&s;tinction, who were not actually engaged, might view the action with the greater ea&s;e and &s;afety, a large amphitheatre of &s;eats was prepared for them, at a convenient di&s;tance from the field of battle.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="122">Every thing being in readine&s;s, the &s;yndics, the council, &s;trangers of di&s;tinction, and relations and favourites of the king, a&s;&s;embled at his Maje&s;ty's palace, a little &s;nug hou&s;e, &s;ituated in a narrow lane, in the lower part of the city. From the palace they marched in proce&s;&s;ion, through the city, with his Maje&s;ty at their head, and preceded by a band of mu&s;ic, who played, as may be &s;up|po&s;ed, the mo&s;t martial tunes they could po&s;&s;ibly think of. When this company came to the field where the troops were drawn up, they were &s;a|luted by the officers; and, having made a com|plete circuit of both armies, the king and all his attendants took their &s;eats at the amphitheatre, which had been prepared for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The impatience of the troops had been very vi&s;ible for &s;ome time. When the king was &s;eated, their ardour could no longer be re&s;trained. They called loudly to their officers to lead them to glory. The &s;ignal was given. They advanced to the attack, in the mo&s;t undaunted manner; con|&s;cious that they fought under the eyes of their king, the &s;yndics, their wives, children, mothers, and grandmothers, they di&s;dained the thoughts of retreat. They &s;tood undi&s;turbed by the thicke&s;t fire, and &s;miled at the roaring of the cannon.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="123">The ingenious author of the battle had taken care to diver&s;ify it with &s;everal entertaining inci|dents. An ambu&s;cade was placed by one of the armies, behind &s;ome trees, to &s;urprize the enemy. This &s;ucceeded to a miracle, although the ambu&s;|cade was po&s;ted in the &s;ight of both armies, and all the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>A convoy with provi&s;ion, advancing towards one of the armies, was attacked by a detachment from the other; and, after a &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;h, one half of the waggons was carried away by the a&s;&s;ailants: the other remained with the troops for whom they &s;eemed to have been originally intended.</P>
<P>A wooden bridge was bri&s;kly attacked, and as re&s;olutely defended, but at length was trodden to pieces by both armies; for in the fury of the fight, the combatants forgot whether this poor bridge was their friend or their foe. By what means it got into the mid&s;t of the battle is not ea&s;y to conceive; for there was neither river, brook, nor ditch, in the whole field.</P>
<P>The cavalry, on both &s;ides, performed wonders. It was difficult to determine which of the generals di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf mo&s;t. They were both dre&s;&s;ed in clothes exuberantly covered with lace (for the
<PB N="123" REF="124">
&s;umptuary laws were &s;u&s;pended for this day) that the battle might be as magnificent as po&s;&s;ible. As neither of the&s;e gallant commanders would con|&s;ent to the being defeated, the reverend author of the engagement could not make the cata&s;trophe &s;o deci&s;ive and affecting as he intended.</P>
<P>While victory, with equipoi&s;ed wings, hovered over both armies, a me&s;&s;enger arrived from the town-hall, with intelligence that dinner was ready. This news quickly &s;pread among the combatants, and had an effect &s;imilar to that which the Sabine women produced, when they ru&s;hed between their ravi&s;hers and their relations. The warriors of Ge|neva relented at once; and both armies &s;u&s;pended their animo&s;ity in the contemplation of that which they both loved. They threw down their arms, &s;hook hands, and were friends.</P>
<P>Thus ended the battle: the &s;ame company which had attended the king to the field of battle, marched with him in proce&s;&s;ion from thence, to the mai&s;on de ville, where a &s;umptuous entertainment was pre|fered. This was exactly the rever&s;e of a f&ecirc;te cham|petre, being held in the town-hou&s;e, and in the middle of the &s;treets adjacent; where tables were covered, and dinner provided for &s;everal hundreds of the officers and &s;oldiers.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="125">The king, the &s;yndics, mo&s;t of the members of the council, and all the &s;trangers, dined in the town-hall. The other rooms, as well as the outward court, were likewi&s;e full of company. There was much greater havoc at dinner, than had been at the battle, and the entertainment in other re&s;pects, was nearly as warlike. A kettle-drum was placed in the middle of the hall, upon which a martial flou|ri&s;h was performed at every toa&s;t. This was imme|diately an&s;wered by the drums and trumpets with|out the hall, and the cannon of the ba&s;tion. Pro&s;|perity to the republic, is a favourite toa&s;t;&mdash;When this was announced by the fir&s;t &s;yndic, all the com|pany &s;tood up with their &s;words drawn in one hand, and gla&s;&s;es filled with wine in the other. Having drank the toa&s;t, they cla&s;hed their &s;words, a ceremony always in every circle or club, where there is a public dinner, as often as this particular toa&s;t is named. It is an old cu&s;tom, and implies that every man is ready to fight in defence of the republic.</P>
<P>After we had been about two hours at table, a new ceremony took place. An hundred grenadiers, with their &s;words drawn, marched with great &s;olem|nity into the middle of the hall, for the tables being placed in the form of a hor&s;e-&s;hoe, there was vacant &s;pace in the middle, &s;ufficient to admit them. They de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to give a toa&s;t: this being granted,
<PB N="125" REF="126">
each of the grenadiers, by a well-timed movement, like a motion in the exerci&s;e, pulled from his pocket a large water-gla&s;s, which being immediately filled with wine, one of the &s;oldiers, in the name of all, drank a health to King <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> the Fir&s;t. (Mo&s;es was the chri&s;tian name of the new king). His example was followed by his companions, and all the compa|ny, and was in&s;tantly honoured by the &s;ound of drums, trumpets, and artillery. When the grena|diers had drank this, and a toa&s;t or two more, they wheeled about, and marched out of the hall with the &s;ame &s;olemnity, with which they had entered, re&s;uming their places at the tables in the &s;treets. Soon after this, a man fanta&s;tically dre&s;&s;ed, entered the hall, and di&s;tributed among the company, &s;ome printed &s;heets, which &s;eemed to have come directly from the pre&s;s. This proved to be a &s;ong, made for the occa&s;ion, replete with gaiety, wit, and good &s;en&s;e; pointing out, in a humourous &s;train, the advantages which the citizens of Geneva po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and exhorting them to unanimity, indu&s;try, and public &s;pirit. This ditty was &s;ung by the man who brought it, while many of the company joined in the chorus.</P>
<P>When we de&s;cended from the town-hall, we found the &s;oldiers intermingled with their officers, &s;till &s;eated at the table in the &s;treets, and encircled by
<PB N="126" REF="127">
their wives and children. They all aro&s;e &s;oon after, and dividing into different companies, repaired to the ramparts, the fields, and the gardens, where, with mu&s;ic and dancing, they continued in high glee, during the re&s;t of the evening.</P>
<P>The whole exhibition of the day, though no very ju&s;t repre&s;entation of the manoeuvres of war, or the elegance of a court entertainment, formed the mo&s;t lively picture of jollity, mirth, good humour, and cordiality that could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;een. The inhabi|tants of a whole city;&mdash;nay, of a whole &s;tate, united in one &s;cene of good fellow&s;hip, like a &s;ingle family, is &s;urely no common &s;ight.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome of the citizens of Geneva, who deride the little military e&s;tabli&s;hment of the repub|lic, and declare it to be highly ridiculous in &s;uch a feeble &s;tate, to pre&s;ume that they could defend them|&s;elves. The very idea of re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t Savoy or France, they hold as ab&s;urd. They &s;eem to take plea&s;ure in mortifying their countrymen, a&s;&s;uring them, that in ca&s;e of an attack, all their efforts would be fruitle&s;s, and their garri&s;on unable to &s;tand a &s;iege of ten days.</P>
<P>The&s;e politicians declaim again&s;t the needle&s;s ex|pence of keeping the fortifications in repair, and
<PB N="127" REF="128">
they calculate the money lo&s;t, by &s;o many manufac|turers being employed in wielding u&s;ele&s;s firelocks, in&s;tead of the tools of their re&s;pective profe&s;&s;ions. Were I a member of this republic, I &s;hould have no patience with the&s;e di&s;couraging malcontents, who endeavour to depre&s;s the minds of their coun|trymen, and embitter a &s;ource of real enjoyment.</P>
<P>The garri&s;on, &s;mall as it is, aided by the zeal of the inhabitants, and regulated by that &s;hare of di&s;|cipline, which their &s;ituation admits, would be &s;uf|ficient to &s;ecure them from a coup de main, or any immediate in&s;ult, and might enable them to defend the town from the attempts of any one of the neigh|bouring &s;tates, till they &s;hould receive &s;uccour from &s;ome of the others. Independent of the&s;e con|&s;iderations, the ramparts are mo&s;t agreeable walks, convenient for the inhabitants, and ornamental to the city. The exerci&s;ing and reviewing the militia, form an innocent and agreeable &s;pectacle to the women and children, contribute to the health and amu&s;ement of the troops them&s;elves, and in&s;pire the inhabitants in general, with the plea&s;ing ideas of &s;ecurity, and of their own importance. Upon the whole, the fortifications and the militia of Ge|neva, produce more happine&s;s in the&s;e various ways taken together, than could be purcha&s;ed by all the money they co&s;t, expended in any other manner.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="129">This is more than can be &s;aid in favour of the greater part of the &s;tanding armies on the continent of Europe, who&s;e numbers &s;ecure the de&s;poti&s;m of the prince; who&s;e maintenance is a mo&s;t &s;evere burden upon the countries which &s;upport them, and who&s;e di&s;cipline, in&s;tead of exciting plea&s;ing emo|tions, impre&s;&s;es the mind with horror.</P>
<P>But it will be &s;aid, they defend the nation from foreign enemies. Alas? could a foreign conqueror occa&s;ion more wretchedne&s;s, than &s;uch defenders? When he who calls him&s;elf my protector, has &s;trip|ped me of my property, and deprived me of my freedom, I cannot return him very cordial thanks, when he tells me, that he will defend me from any other robber.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;olid &s;ecurity which this little republic has for its independence, is founded on the mutual jealou&s;y of its neighbours. There is no danger of its meeting with the misfortune which befel Po|land, Geneva being &s;uch an atom of a &s;tate, as not to be divi&s;ible. It &s;eems, however, as a kind of barrier or alarm-po&s;t to the Swi&s;s cantons, particu|larly that of Berne, which certainly would not like to &s;ee it in the hands, either of the king of France, or of Sardinia. The acqui&s;ition is not worth the
<PB N="129" REF="130">
attention of the fir&s;t; and it is better for the &s;econd, that the republic &s;hould remain in its pre&s;ent free and independent &s;ituation, than that it &s;hould revert to his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and be &s;ubjected to the &s;ame go|vernment with his other dominions. For no &s;ooner would Geneva be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sardinia, than the wealthie&s;t of the citizens would abandon it, and carry their families and riches to Switzerland, Holland, or England. Trade and manufactures would dwindle with the &s;pirit and independence of the inhabitants; and the flouri&s;hing, enlightened, happy city of Geneva, like other towns of Pied|mont and Savoy, would become the re&s;idence of op|pre&s;&s;ion, &s;uper&s;tition, and poverty. In this &s;itua|tion, it could add but little to the king's revenue; while, at pre&s;ent, the pea&s;ants of his dominions re|&s;ort every market-day in great numbers to Geneva, where they find a ready &s;ale for all the productions of their farms. The land is on this account more valuable, and the pea&s;ants are more at their ea&s;e, though the rents are very high, more &s;o, than in any other part of Savoy. The republic, therefore, in its pre&s;ent independent &s;tate, is of more u&s;e to the king of Sardinia, than if it were his property.</P>
<P>From this it may be perceived, that the &s;tability of this little fabric of freedom, does not depend on
<PB N="130" REF="131">
the ju&s;tice and moderation of the neighbouring powers, or on any equivocal &s;upport, but is founded on the &s;olid, la&s;ting pillars of their mutual in|tere&s;t.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> Commerce.</HEAD>
<P>TRADE at Geneva, in&s;tead of waiting at home for cu&s;tomers, travels in &s;earch of them, and where it can be promoted, the Geneve&s;e always re&s;ort. Its principal branches are clocks, watches, articles of jewellery, mu&s;lins, and the finer &s;ort of linens.</P>
<P>Great part of the clock and watch pieces are made in the mountains of Switzerland; this being the occupation of the inhabitants, during the &s;nowy &s;ea&s;on. Mo&s;t of them work for watch-makers in
<PB N="131" REF="132">
Geneva, who purcha&s;e the&s;e pieces of them, half wrought, and work them up into watches, which, with incredible indu&s;try, they vend all over France, Spain, and Germany. They al&s;o export great quantities to the commercial hou&s;es, which &s;everal of the&s;e Geneva traders have in Paris, or to watch-makers of that city, who get their name in&s;cribed on them, and &s;ell them for their own work.</P>
<P>London was formerly a great cu&s;tomer to them in the article of watches, but we having increa&s;ed this manufacture among our&s;elves, furni&s;h a &s;uffi|cient quantity for our own con&s;umption, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Geneve&s;e; or if we take any of their goods, it mu&s;t be at our own price. This proceeding has &s;o far cooled the great fondne&s;s, which the Geneve&s;e pretended formerly to have for us, that they now openly declare us to be a pack of jews, who would have others take every thing from them, without their taking any thing from others. From England, however, it is, that they &s;till im|port the greater part of their cloth, both for home con&s;umption, and for &s;ending into Italy, and like|wi&s;e that which they &s;muggle into France, owning at the &s;ame time, that French cloths, at lea&s;t the finer &s;ort, are pre&s;erable to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The two la&s;t wars in France, having been very
<PB N="132" REF="133">
detrimental to their jewellery trade, had driven a great number of workmen and dealers, to emigrate from Paris. The Geneve&s;e received them kindly, and &s;et them to work; &s;o that the jewellery trade at pre&s;ent, fully repairs the lo&s;s which the indu&s;try of the Engli&s;h had occa&s;ioned them to &s;u&s;tain, in that of their watches: they &s;eem even in a fair way, to &s;upplant France, in this con&s;iderable branch of commerce. The &s;tandard of the gold and &s;ilver, which they work up, is left to them&s;elves; but the &s;tandard is what a fine lady or fopling, who mu&s;t have a &s;nuff-box or a tweezer, never trouble them|&s;elves about: be&s;ides, here is no duty to be paid; and as to the duties of import into France and Spain, their manner of eluding them, is thus: The Geneve&s;e merchant and his &s;ervant, &s;et out from Geneva, well mounted, with two portmanteaus filled with watches and trinkets; the ma&s;ter is in a Swi&s;s, half uniform, and, at every pa&s;s and gate of a town, claps on a cockade; to every <HI>Qui va la?</HI> his an|&s;wer is, <HI>Officier Swi&s;s,</HI> and he goes on without fur|ther ceremony.</P>
<P>The Geneva trade, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in mu&s;lins, cal|licoes, lawns, and flowered linens. The greater part of the mu&s;lins worn in France, come from hence, and Geneva has them from Switzerland. In the la&s;t war in France, Geneva even &s;upplied the
<PB N="133" REF="134">
&s;ale at Port L'Orient with the&s;e goods, which other|wi&s;e mu&s;t have failed by the delay of the India com|pany's return. As to the&s;e matters, all Switzer|land may be looked on as one va&s;t manufacture, in which every advantage concentrates, entire free|dom, exemption from all duties, plenty of raw ma|terials, cheapne&s;s of labour, and the ince&s;&s;ant indu&s;|try of a very laborious people. It mu&s;t have been by means more efficacious than &s;chemes, memoirs, and di&s;&s;ertations, that Geneva and Ba&s;le have con|trived to put off from time to time, the prohibi|tion of printed cottons in France. A pretty nice conjecture of the advantages of &s;uch a prohibition to that kingdom, might have been formed only from the bu&s;tle and con&s;ternation of the&s;e two cities.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of this account, &s;hews that the ballance of a very con&s;iderable trade between France, Swit|zerland, and the Geneve&s;e, is entirely in favour of the latter, who take nothing from France but corn, making but a very &s;lender deduction from the &s;ums which the payment of the Swi&s;s troops draws from France; and this trade is always carried on to their advantage, whether part of the corn be remitted into Germany, or as is &s;ometimes done, re|imported into France, which is attended with con|&s;iderable profit.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVII.</HI> Mount Blanc and Glaciers.</HEAD>
<P>VARIOUS attempts having been made to reach the &s;ummit of Mount Blanc, &s;ituated near Ge|neva, on the borders of Switzerland, which is not only the highe&s;t mountain in the whole world, but one of the mo&s;t remarkable objects in it; a chrono|logical account of the principal expeditions, which at length terminated &s;ucce&s;sfully, will not perhaps be unintere&s;ting.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t enterpri&s;e was formed in 1776, by <HI>M. Couterau,</HI> and three guides of Chamouny. The&s;e adventurers &s;et out from thence, on the 13th of July, about eleven o'clock in the evening, and after having employed about 14 hours in mounting rugged and dangerous a&s;cents, in cro&s;&s;ing &s;everal vallies of ice, and large plains of &s;now, they found them&s;elves on the top, next to Mount Blanc. At fir&s;t &s;ight, it appeared &s;carcely a league di&s;tance; but they &s;oon di&s;covered that the clearne&s;s of the
<PB N="135" REF="136">
air, the whitene&s;s of the &s;now, and its great height, made it &s;eem nearer than it was in reality: and they perceived with regret, that it would require four hours more to reach the &s;ummit, even &s;uppo&s;ing it practicable. The day being far &s;pent, and the va|pours having begun to collect into clouds on the &s;um|mit of the mountain, they were obliged to de&s;i&s;t from their enterprize. As they were returning in great ha&s;te, one of the party &s;lipped, in attempting to leap over a cha&s;m of ice. He held in his hand a long pole, &s;piked with iron, which he &s;truck into the ice, and upon this, he hung dreadfully &s;u&s;pended for a few minutes, until he was relea&s;ed by his companions. Many of the&s;e cha&s;ms, are &s;everal hundred fathoms in depth, and from one, to five or &s;ix feet in breadth. The danger this man had ju&s;t e&s;caped, made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon him, that he fainted away, and continued for &s;ome time in that &s;ituation: he was at length brought to him&s;elf, and though con&s;iderably brui&s;ed, &s;ufficiently reco|vered, to be able to continue his journey. They arrived at Chamauny that evening, after having em|ployed 22 hours in this expedition: as &s;ome &s;ort of recompence, they enjoyed the &s;atisfaction, at lea&s;t, of having approached nearer to Mount Blanc, than any former adventurers.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">The failure of this expedition, &s;eemed for &s;ome time to repre&s;s all future attempts to attain the top of Mount Blanc, until the indefatigable Mr. <HI>Bourrit,</HI> infu&s;ed a new &s;pirit into the inhabitants of Cha|mouny. After reiterated, though un&s;ucce&s;sful at|tempts; on the 11th of September, 1784, Mr. <HI>Bourrit,</HI> accompanied by &s;ix guides, attempted to &s;cale, as he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, the rampart of Mount Blanc, when he &s;uddenly found him&s;elf &s;o extremely affected by the inten&s;e cold, as to be unable to pro|ceed.</P>
<P>On the 7th of Augu&s;t, 1786, Dr. <HI>Paccard,</HI> a phy|&s;ician of Chamouny, accompanied by <HI>James Balma,</HI> a guide, &s;allied from thence on this memorable expe|dition, and reached before dark, the mountain of La Cote, which overhangs the upper part of the gla|cier of Bo&s;&s;on. Here they pa&s;&s;ed the night; and at three in the morning, pur&s;ued their route over the ice, a&s;cended the Dome of Gout&eacute;, pa&s;&s;ed under the Middle Dome, and at the la&s;t pyramid of rock, turned to the ea&s;t, and continued along the ridge, which is &s;een from Geneva, and lies on the left of the &s;ummit. Here they fir&s;t began to feel &s;uch in|ten&s;e cold, and &s;uch extreme fatigue, that the Dr. was almo&s;t induced to relinqui&s;h the enterprize: being, however, encouraged by the guide, more accu&s;tomed to &s;uch fatiguing and dangerous expe|ditions,
<PB N="137" REF="138">
he followed his companion. The wind was &s;o violent, that in order to avoid its blowing in their faces, they were obliged to walk &s;ideways for a con|&s;iderable time. About &s;ix in the afternoon, they at length attained the &s;ummit of Mount Blanc, and &s;tood triumphantly on a &s;pot of ground, which no one had reached before; and at the elevation of 15,662 feet above the &s;ea, which is three times higher than Snowdon, and undoubtedly the highe&s;t point in the ancient globe. They remained on the &s;ummit no more than half an hour, the cold being &s;o inten&s;e, that the provi&s;ion was frozen in their pockets, and the ink congealed in their inkhorns.</P>
<P>They had employed 15 hours in a&s;cending; and though they again reached the mountain of La Cote in five hours, yet they found great difficulty in de|&s;cending, their &s;ight being debilitated by the reflec|tion of the &s;now. They arrived at Ea Cote about midnight, after 20 hours unremitting fatigue. Having repo&s;ed them&s;elves two hours, they again &s;allied forth, and returned to Chamouny, at eight in the morning. Their faces were excoriated, and their lips exceedingly &s;welled; Dr. <HI>Pacard</HI> was al|mo&s;t blind, and his eyes continued to be affected for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="139">We cannot expect any accurate experiments from the&s;e two per&s;ons, to whom the glory of having fir&s;t a&s;cended the &s;ummit of Mount Blanc, is undoubt|edly due. But they prepared the way for the ob&s;er|vations and di&s;coveries of future naturali&s;ts, and particularly of <HI>M. de Sau&s;&s;ure,</HI> who&s;e indefatigable zeal, did not permit him to re&s;t, until he had reached the top of Mount Blanc, and made tho&s;e ex|periments, which cannot fail greatly to elucidate the theory of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>That able naturali&s;t &s;at out on this &s;ucce&s;sful ex|pedition, from the valley of Chamouny; on the 13th of Augu&s;t, 1787. He was accompanied by 18 guides, who carried a tent, matra&s;&s;es, all nece&s;&s;ary accommodations, and in&s;truments of experimental philo&s;ophy. They pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t night on the top of the mountain La Cote, in a hut, previou&s;ly con|&s;tructed for that purpo&s;e. At four o'clock in the following afternoon, they reached an elevation of nearly 13,000 feet above the level of the &s;ea. Here they encamped and formed an excavation in the con|gealed &s;now, which they covered with a tent. In this icy habitation, in&s;tead of &s;uffering from the cold, <HI>M. de Sau&s;&s;ure</HI> felt &s;uch a &s;uffocating heat from the clo&s;ene&s;s of the tent, and the number of per&s;ons crowded in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s, that he was
<PB N="139" REF="140">
frequently obliged to go into the open air, in order to breathe.</P>
<P>The next morning, the whole company departed at &s;even; and found the a&s;cent in &s;ome places &s;o &s;teep, that they who preceded, were obliged to hew out &s;teps with a hatchet. At eleven, they reached the &s;ummit of Mount Blanc. Here they continued three hours and a half, during which time, <HI>M. de Sau&s;&s;ure</HI> enjoyed with rapture and a&s;toni&s;hment, a view the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, as well as the mo&s;t rugged and &s;ublime in nature; and made tho&s;e ob&s;ervations, which will render this expedition no longer a matter of mere curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>He did not find the cold &s;o extremely piercing, as was experienced by Dr. <HI>Paccard</HI> and <HI>James Balma.</HI> On e&s;timating the height of Mount Blanc, from barometrical experiments, he found it almo&s;t ex|actly corre&s;pond with that given by Sir <HI>George Shuckborough,</HI> or 15,662 Engli&s;h feet above the level of the &s;ea, and which reflects the highe&s;t honour on the accuracy of the Engli&s;h ob&s;erver. By experi|ments with the hygrometer, the air on the top of Mount Blanc, contained &s;ix times le&s;s humidity than that of Geneva; and to this extreme dryne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere, he imputes the burning thir&s;t, which he and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s companions experienced. It requires
<PB N="140" REF="141">
half an hour to boil water on the top of Mount Blanc; 15 or 16 minutes are &s;ufficient at Geneva, and 14 or 15 by the &s;ea-&s;ide. By experiments on the electrometer, the balls diverged only three lines; the electricity was po&s;itive. On the &s;ummit, he noticed two butterflies on the wing, and ob&s;erved at the elevation of 11,000 feet above the &s;ea, the mo&s;s-campion in flower.</P>
<P>He adds, that the &s;ummits of Mount Blanc, and the adjacent mountains, were compo&s;ed of granite: and that after Mount Blanc, the Sereckhorn, and Mount Ro&s;a in Piedmont, appeared the mo&s;t ele|vated points.</P>
<P><HI>M. de Sau&s;&s;ure,</HI> as well as many of his party, found them&s;elves extremely affected by the rarefaction of the air; and at two, began returning. They de|fended a little lower than the place in which they pa&s;&s;ed the preceding night, and arrived the next morning at the valley of Chamouny, without the lea&s;t accident; and as they had taken the precaution to cover their faces with crape, their &s;kins were not excoriated, nor their &s;ight debilitated.</P>
<P>On the eighth of Augu&s;t, a few days after <HI>M. de Sau&s;&s;ure's</HI> expedition, Mr. <HI>Beaufoy,</HI> an Engli&s;h gen|tleman, &s;ucceeded in a &s;imilar attempt, though it
<PB N="141" REF="142">
was attended with greater difficulty, ari&s;ing from the enlargement of the cha&s;ms in the ice.</P>
<P>No &s;ubject is more curious in natural hi&s;tory, than the origin of the&s;e glaciers, extending into fields of corn and pa&s;ture, and lying, without being melted, in a &s;ituation where the &s;un is &s;ufficient to bring the earth to maturity: for it is almo&s;t literally true, that with one hand a per&s;on may touch ice, and with the other, ripe corn.</P>
<P>If a per&s;on could be conveyed to &s;uch an eleva|tion, as to embrace at one view, the Alps of Swit|zerland, Savoy, and Dauphine, he would behold a va&s;t chain of mountains, inter&s;cepted by numerous vallies, and compo&s;ed of many parallel chains, the highe&s;t occupying the center, and the others gradu|ally dimini&s;hing in proportion to their di&s;tance from that center. The mo&s;t elevated, or central chain, would appear bri&s;tled with pointed rocks; and covered even in &s;ummer, with ice and &s;now, in all parts not ab&s;olutely perpendicular. On each &s;ide of this chain, he would di&s;cover deep vallies clothed with verdure, peopled with numerous vil|lages, and watered by many rivers. In con&s;idering the&s;e objects with greater attention, he would re|mark, that the central chain is compo&s;ed of elevated peaks, who&s;e &s;ummits are over&s;pread with &s;now;
<PB N="142" REF="143">
that the declivities, excepting tho&s;e parts extremely &s;teep, are covered with &s;now and ice; and the in|termediate depths and &s;paces, are filled with immen&s;e fields of ice, terminating in tho&s;e cultivated vallies, which border the great chain. The branches mo&s;t contiguous to the central chain, would pre&s;ent the &s;ame phenomena, only in a le&s;&s;er degree. At greater di&s;tances, no ice would be ob&s;erved, and &s;carcely any &s;now, but upon &s;ome of the mo&s;t elevated &s;um|mits; and the mountains dimini&s;hing in height, and ruggedne&s;s, would appear covered with herbage, and gradually &s;ink into hills and plains.</P>
<P>In this general &s;urvey, the glaciers may be divided into two &s;orts; the fir&s;t occupying the deep vallies, &s;ituated in the bo&s;om of the Alps, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Lower Glaciers; the &s;econd, which clothe the &s;ummits and &s;ides of the mountains, cal|led Upper Glaciers. The Lower Glaciers, are by far the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in extent and depth. Some &s;tretch &s;everal leagues in length; one in particular, is more than 15 miles long, and above three in its greate&s;t breadth. The thickne&s;s of the ice varies in different parts, <HI>M. de Sau&s;&s;ure</HI> found its general depth from 80 to 100 feet; but que&s;tions not the in|formation of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert, that in &s;ome places its thickne&s;s exceeds even 600 feet.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="144">The&s;e immen&s;e fields of ice, u&s;ually re&s;t on an in|clined plain: being pu&s;hed forwards by the pre&s;&s;ure of their own weight, and but weakly &s;upported by the rugged rocks beneath, are inter&s;ected by large tran&s;ver&s;e crevices; and pre&s;ent the appearance of walls, pyramids, and other fanta&s;tic &s;hapes, ob|&s;erved at all heights and in all &s;ituations, wherever the declivity is beyond 30 or 40 degrees. Where the plain on which they re&s;t, is horizontal, or only gently inclined, the &s;urface of the ice is nearly uni|form, and the traveller cro&s;&s;es them without much difficulty. The ice is not &s;o &s;lippery, as that of fro|zen ponds and rivers: it is rough and granulated, and is only dangerous to the pa&s;&s;enger, where there is a &s;teep de&s;cent. It is not tran&s;parent, but extremely porous and full of &s;mall bubbles, which &s;eldom ex|ceed the &s;ize of a pea; and con&s;equently is not &s;o compact as common ice. Its perfect re&s;emblance to the congelation of &s;now, impregnated with water, led <HI>M. de Sau&s;&s;ure</HI> to conceive the following &s;imple and natural theory, on the formation of the gla|ciers.</P>
<P>An immen&s;e quantity of &s;now is continually ac|cumulating in the elevated vallies, which are enclo&s;ed within the Alps, as well from that which falls from the clouds, during nine months in the year, as from the ma&s;&s;es which are ince&s;&s;antly rolling from the
<PB N="144" REF="145">
&s;teep &s;ides of the circumjacent mountains. Part of this &s;now, which is not di&s;&s;olved during &s;ummer, being impregnated with rain and &s;now-water, is frozen during winter, and forms that opaque and porous ice, of which the Lower Glaciers are com|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Upper Glaciers may be &s;ubdivided into tho&s;e which cover the &s;ummits, and tho&s;e which extend along the &s;ides of the Alps. Tho&s;e which cover the &s;ummits of the Alps, owe their origin to the &s;now that falls at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and which remains nearly in its original &s;tate, being congealed into a hard &s;ub&s;tance, and not converted into ice. The &s;ub&s;tance which clothes the &s;ides of the Alps, is neither pure &s;now like that of the &s;ummits, nor ice which forms the lower glaciers, but is an a&s;&s;em|blage of both.</P>
<P>The a&s;cent of Mount Blanc, being a work of &s;o much danger and difficulty, ordinary travellers con|tent them&s;elves in their tour through Switzerland, with going to take a view of the glaciers, and of Mount Blanc, from &s;ome of the mountains adjacent, to the vale of Chamouny. There are five or &s;ix of the&s;e, which all terminate upon one &s;ide of the valley of Chamouny.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="146">The Glacier Des Bois, is not only the mo&s;t acce&s;|&s;ible, but one of the mo&s;t curious. It is not the wide&s;t, but it de&s;cends without interruption, from Mount Blanc it&s;elf, and affords all the variety of objects we meet with in the glacier; the lofty walls and towers, the waving &s;eas, and the tremendous fi&s;|&s;ures.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting objects here, is the magnificent vault of ice at the foot of the glacier, from whence the river Arveron takes its &s;ource. The acce&s;s to it, &s;eems blocked up by hugh ma&s;&s;es of rock, wildly thrown about. Within, immen&s;e blocks of tran&s;parent ice are &s;cattered about the floor, warning the traveller to tru&s;t him&s;elf with caution, to the brittle arch over his head. From the further part of the cavern, boils forth melted ice, forming rivulets, that meander all about it. In dif|ferent years, it puts on very different appearances. It expo&s;es it&s;elf to view only a &s;hort time; for till the end of July, or the beginning of Augu&s;t, no|thing appears, but a rude ma&s;s of ice, walling up the cavern: at length this falls, and all at once opens to view, this beautiful vault, which has not been un|aptly termed, the Temple of the God of Fro&s;t.</P>
<P>What renders the pa&s;&s;age over the glaciers &s;o dif|ficult and dangerous is, the rents in the ice, which are
<PB N="146" REF="147">
to be met with in every direction. The&s;e rents, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> are from two to 600 feet wide, and of an amazing depth; reaching from the &s;urface of the valley, thro' a body of ice, many hundred fathoms thick. On throwing down a &s;tone, or any other &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance, we could hear the hollow murmur of its de&s;cent, for a very long time, &s;ounding like far di&s;tant waves, breaking upon rocks.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVIII.</HI> Neuchatel.</HEAD>
<P>THE principality of Neuchatel and Vallengin &s;tretches from the lake to the limits of Franche Comt&egrave;, containing in length from north to &s;outh, about 12 leagues, and about &s;ix in its greate&s;t breadth. The principality of Neuchatel, occupies all the plain together, with the lower parts of the mountains: while Vallengin is totally enclo&s;ed within the Jura.
<PB N="147" REF="148">
Parallel chains of the Jura, run from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and form in the mo&s;t elevated part, &s;everal vallies. The lower grounds are laid out in arable lands and vine|yards; the higher con&s;i&s;ts of a large tract of fore&s;t, intermixed with fields of barley and oats. But what particularly de&s;erves the attention of every curious traveller, is, the &s;ingular genius and indu&s;try of the very populous inhabitants of the&s;e vallies, of which after having &s;poken of Neuchatel, we &s;hall treat more fully.</P>
<P>Neuchatel and Vallengin once formed two di&s;tinct principalities; each having a &s;eparate and inde|pendent government: but for &s;ome time pa&s;t, they have been united into one. By the death of the Duche&s;s of <HI>Nemours,</HI> in 1707, the &s;overeignty of the&s;e two countries became vacant; to which, as heir to the Prince of <HI>Orange, Frederic</HI> the Fir&s;t, King of Pru&s;&s;ia, among&s;t many others, put in his claim; and his right was acknowledged by the &s;tates of the country. After his death, it de&s;cended to his &s;on <HI>Frederic William,</HI> who tran&s;mitted it with his other dominions to the late King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the pre&s;ent monarch.</P>
<P>The whole principality contains near 40,000 in|habitants, of which there are 3,000 in the capital;
<PB N="148" REF="149">
it is there the governor re&s;ides, and the general ad|mini&s;tration of public affairs is carried on.</P>
<P>The town of Neuchatel is &s;mall. It lies partly upon the little plain, between the lake of Neu|chatel and Mount Jura, and partly upon the decli|vity of that mountain: in con&s;equence of which &s;ituation, &s;ome of its &s;treets are rather &s;teep. At the commencement of the pre&s;ent century, com|merce was almo&s;t wholly a &s;tranger here; as the ridiculous pride of its being deemed degrading, generally prevailed among them. This &s;en&s;ele&s;s pre|judice, however, is now nearly worn out; and a con|&s;iderable trade is carried on. The chief article of their exportation is wine, produced from the neigh|bouring vineyards, and much e&s;teemed. Several manufactures al&s;o of cotton and mu&s;lin have been e&s;tabli&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s; and within the&s;e few years, the merchants of this town have rai&s;ed large fortunes.</P>
<P>The mildne&s;s of the government, and the general well-being of the inhabitants, are vi&s;ibly demon|&s;trated from the increa&s;e of population among the natives, and the prodigious influx of &s;ettlers. The facility of acquiring the burgher&s;hip of Neuchatel, has al&s;o prevented any decrea&s;e of the inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="150">Several public buildings have been lately erect|ed at Neuchatel, at an expence far exceeding the revenues, or even wants of this little &s;tate. Among&s;t others are a &s;uperb cau&s;eway leading to|ward the valley of S. Imici, and a town-hou&s;e built of &s;uch &s;olid materials, as if it was intended to &s;urvive to the mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;terity, and to rival the duration of the much famed Roman capital.</P>
<P>The per&s;on to whom the burghers of Neuchatel principally owe the embelli&s;hment of their town is M. <HI>David Perry,</HI> late banker of the court at Li&s;bon. He was a citizen of Neuchatel, and was born in 1709. He died on the 31&s;t of May 1785, and the fortune he bequeathed to his country amounts to 160,000<HI>l.</HI> which with the contributions in his life time renders his benefactions equal to almo&s;t 200,000<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>His grateful country obtained from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia the title of Baron, in his favour; a title, which through his &s;ingular mode&s;ty, he neither bore nor u&s;ed in the &s;ignature of his letters. The citizens of Neuchatel have al&s;o placed the portrait of this generous benefactor in one of the apartments in which government a&s;&s;embles.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151">The town con&s;i&s;ts of four large &s;treets and an old ca&s;tle, in which the governor re&s;ides, with two churches and a gymna&s;ium. Around the town on all &s;ides are vineyards, gardens, and plea&s;ant &s;eats.</P>
<P>Its regency con&s;i&s;ts of the le&s;&s;er and greater council; the former of which is compo&s;ed of twenty-four members, and the latter of forty. The&s;e attend to the police and other public concerns.</P>
<P>In the di&s;trict of Vallengin among the valleys of Mount Jura, are the two celebrated villages of La Chaux de Fond and Locle, the inhabitants of which are &s;o remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed for their genius, in|du&s;try, and &s;kill in the mechanical arts, and which flouri&s;h here in their greate&s;t perfection. The in|habitants who are computed to be about 6,000, carry on an exten&s;ive commerce in lace, &s;tock|ings, cutlery, and other different kinds of mer|chandi&s;e of their own manufactures; but watches and every branch of clock making, are the articles in which they particularly and eminently excel. They not only make every uten&s;il employed in tho&s;e arts, but have invented &s;everal: and all &s;orts of workmen nece&s;&s;ary for the completion of that branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch as painters, enamellers,
<PB N="151" REF="152">
engravers, gilders, &amp;c. are found in their villages; where it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that upon an average about forty thou&s;and watches are annually made. The genius and indu&s;try ob&s;ervable upon the&s;e moun|tains, exhibit a &s;cene uncommonly plea&s;ing; and no where perhaps, except in Geneva, are there &s;uch a number apparently &s;o much at their ea&s;e. Ac|cordingly as every individual is &s;ure not only of ob|taining a comfortable maintenance for him&s;elf, but of &s;oon placing his children al&s;o in a way of getting their livelihood; they all marry very early; for women and children are employed in &s;ome of the branches of watch-making; and a child of but ten years old may earn ten pence a day, by giving the la&s;t poli&s;h to &s;teel in&s;truments with the hand. And as to the men, there are few who do not get half a crown a day; and &s;ome, nine &s;hillings.</P>
<P>Not many years ago, the greate&s;t part of the&s;e valleys was almo&s;t one continued fore&s;t; but the wonder-working powers of indu&s;try have happily changed the &s;cene into flouri&s;hing villages and fer|tile pa&s;tures. Population has encrea&s;ed of cour&s;e; and the following fact will give &s;ome idea how much it has encrea&s;ed. Formerly the produce of the country was more than &s;ufficient for the con&s;ump|tion of its inhabitants; at pre&s;ent, although it is con&s;iderably more cultivated, they draw &s;even-eighths
<PB N="152" REF="153">
of their provi&s;ion from Franche Comt&eacute;. And no wonder; for, be&s;ides the natural effect of their frequent and early marriages, every &s;tranger, who brings a certificate of his good behaviour, is at liberty to &s;ettle here, and to carry on any trade he thinks proper, without the lea&s;t re&s;triction. Here, no apprentice&s;hip is nece&s;&s;ary; nothing is contraband; and indu&s;try exerts her&s;elf untaxed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides tho&s;e particular arts already mentioned, &s;ome of the inhabitants are well &s;killed in other branches of mechanical &s;cience; and have invented &s;everal u&s;eful mathematical and agronomical in&s;tru|ments. Among tho&s;e who have eminently di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves in this way is the famous <HI>Jaquet Dro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> who&s;e &s;on exhibited in England &s;everal au|tomatical figures of a very &s;ingular and &s;urprizing con&s;truction: one of the&s;e plays upon the harp&s;i|chord; another draws land&s;capes; and what is &s;till more extraordinary, a third copies any word pre|&s;ented to it, or writes down whatever the company &s;hall plea&s;e to dictate.</P>
<P>The origin of watch-making in this part of Switzerland is extremely curious. In 1769 one of the inhabitants brought with him a watch from England, the fir&s;t that had been &s;een in tho&s;e parts; which, happening to be out of order, he ventured
<PB N="135" REF="154">
to tru&s;t it in the hands of one <HI>Daniel John Richard</HI> of La Sagne. <HI>Richard,</HI> after examining the me|chani&s;m with great attention, conceived him&s;elf capable, and was determined to attempt to make a watch from the model before him, but to this end he was de&s;titute of every other a&s;&s;i&s;tance than the powers of his own native genius. Accordingly he employed a whole year in inventing and fini&s;hing the &s;everal in&s;truments previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary for ex|ecuting his purpo&s;e; and in &s;ix months from that period, by the &s;ole force of his own penetrating and per&s;evering talents, he produced a complete watch. But his ambition and indu&s;try did not &s;top here: be&s;ides applying him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;sfully to the inven|tion of &s;everal new in&s;truments u&s;eful for the per|fection of his work, he took a journey to Geneva, where he gained con&s;iderable information in the art. He continued for &s;ome time the only man in tho&s;e parts who could make a watch, but bu&s;ine&s;s encrea&s;ing, he took in, and in&s;tructed &s;everal a&s;|&s;ociates; by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he was enabled to &s;upply from his &s;ingle &s;hop all the demands of the neighbouring country. Toward the beginning of the pre&s;ent century he removed to Locle, where he died in 1741, leaving five &s;ons, who all followed their father's occupation. From the&s;e the know|ledge and practice of the art gradually &s;pread it&s;elf, till it at length became almo&s;t the univer&s;al bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="154" REF="155">
of the inhabitants, and the principal cau&s;e of the populou&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e mountains.</P>
<P>But it is not merely in the&s;e articles, that the genius of the mechanical people is ob&s;ervable; it di&s;covers it&s;elf on all occa&s;ions, when it can be ap|plied to the purpo&s;es of their convenience and ac|commodation. To give an in&s;tance, the rocks in mo&s;t parts of the Alps being exceedingly hard and &s;olid; the water can only make its way along their &s;ides, and ru&s;h down in perpetual torrents; but the &s;trata, which compo&s;e the Jura, being le&s;s firm and compact; the rains and melted &s;now penetrate with impetuo&s;ity into the crevices, and only di&s;cover them&s;elves by breaking out into rivulets at the bot|tom of the mountains.</P>
<P>Now the pea&s;ants in order to avail them&s;elves of this peculiarity, have erected mills at a great ex|pence, and with incredible labour &s;ome yards under the rocks, which are turned by tho&s;e internal tor|rents of water, that force their way through the crevices above-mentioned. For this purpo&s;e the builders have con&s;tructed wheels where it &s;eemed &s;carcely practicable, and have invented new modes of &s;caffolding, and a great variety of other ingenious contrivances, in order to facilitate their work.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="156">The inhabitants of the&s;e &s;everal di&s;tricts are ex|ceedingly courteous, and ready to give every a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in their power to &s;trangers who vi&s;it their country. They are in general very well informed in &s;everal branches of knowledge; and as they u&s;ually employ their lei&s;ure hours in reading, there are circulating libraries to be found in many of the villages.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es are in general &s;mall, but hand&s;ome and well built: many of them are furni&s;hed with a degree of neatne&s;s and even elegance, peculiarly &s;triking. Indeed luxury, or what according to the &s;implicity of manners is here &s;o called, has made no incon&s;iderable progre&s;s in the&s;e mountains; of this one of the inhabitants of Locle gave a curious proof, who &s;eriou&s;ly complained that it was now no unu&s;ual circum&s;tance for the ma&s;ter of a family to carry his wife to Be&s;an&ccedil;on to &s;ee a play; and that there were now at lea&s;t ten hair-dre&s;&s;ers &s;ettled at Locle; whereas, &s;ome few years ago there was but one to be found in the town and its whole di&s;trict.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of Neuchatel is a limited mo|narchy. The machine of this government is in|deed actuated by &s;uch nice &s;prings, that it is very difficult for a &s;tranger to di&s;tingui&s;h, with any degree
<PB N="156" REF="157">
of accuracy, the prerogative of the &s;overeign, and the franchi&s;es of the people: particularly as &s;ome even of their mo&s;t important privileges, depend upon mutual acquie&s;cence and immemorial cu&s;tom, and not upon written laws. Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Frederic</HI> the Fir&s;t, certain general articles, which in a great mea&s;ure e&s;tabli&s;hed the prerogatives of the Prince and the liberties of the &s;ubject, were &s;igned and ratified by the King.</P>
<P>The Prince confers nobility, nominates to the principal offices of &s;tate, both civil and military, and appoints the chatelains and mayors who pre|cide in the court of ju&s;tice. His revenues which are very moderate, and &s;carcely amount to 5000<HI>l.</HI> a year, ari&s;es from certain deme&s;nes; from a &s;mall land tax; from the tythes of wine and corn; and from the tenth of the value on the &s;ale of immove|ables. With regard to commerce, no &s;ubjects pays any duties either on importation or exportation, except for foreign wines imported into the town of Neuchatel.</P>
<P>During the ab&s;ence of the Prince, he is repre|&s;ented by a governor of his own appointing; who enjoys con&s;iderable honours, but is extremely li|mited in his authority. He convokes the three e&s;tate; precedes in that a&s;&s;embly; and has the
<PB N="157" REF="158">
ca&s;ting vote, if the &s;uffrages happen to be equal. He enjoys the power al&s;o, in criminal ca&s;es, of par|doning or of mitigating the &s;entence. In the go|vernor's ab&s;ence his place is &s;upplied by the &s;enior coun&s;ellor of &s;tate.</P>
<P>The people of Vallengin a&s;&s;emble every three years in an open plain, in order to elect their three <HI>ma&s;ter-burghers.</HI> Their function is to watch over the general intere&s;t of the people: they are al&s;o in &s;ome ca&s;es deputed to Neuchatel by the people, whenever they are &s;ummoned by the governor and council of &s;tate, in relation to any affair which particularly concerns their county.</P>
<P>Such are the general outlines of this remarkable con&s;titution, by which the liberties of the people are as well, and perhaps better &s;ecured, than even in the democratic cantons; for, although the mo&s;t de&s;potic prince in Germany is their &s;overeign, his power is exceedingly limited. Among the &s;triking circum&s;tances which characteri&s;e this government, mu&s;t be mentioned the very liberal encouragement given to &s;trangers who &s;ettle in this country. They enjoy every po&s;&s;ible privilege of trade and com|merce; and in no &s;tate are fewer e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinc|tions made between them and the nations. The good effects of this enlarged policy has already been

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIX.</HI> Review of Switzerland.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now laid before our readers a pretty full and comprehen&s;ive account of the laws, government, &s;tate of literature, and a &s;ituation of the principal towns and cantons of Switzerland &s;epa|rately, we &s;hall conclude with &s;ome further remarks in relation to the cu&s;toms and manners, and political a&s;pect of that country in general.</P>
<P>What is very &s;ingular in the fir&s;t place, no part of Europe contains within the &s;ame compa&s;s &s;o
<PB N="159" REF="160">
many independent commonwealths, and &s;uch a va|riety of different governments as are collected to|gether in this remarkable and delightful country; and yet with &s;uch wi&s;dom has the Helvetic union been compo&s;ed, and &s;o little have the Swi&s;s, of late years been actuated by a &s;pirit of conque&s;t, that &s;ince the firm and complete e&s;tabli&s;hment of their general confederacy, they have &s;eldom found occa|&s;ion to employ their army again&s;t a foreign enemy; nor have they been troubled with any civil commo|tions, that were not &s;oon happily terminated. Per|haps there is not a &s;imilar in&s;tance in ancient or modern hi&s;tory, of a warlike people, divided into little independent republics, clo&s;ely bordering upon each other, and occa&s;ionally interfering in their re|&s;pective intere&s;ts, having continued during &s;o long a period, in an almo&s;t uninterrupted &s;tate of tran|quillity. And thus, while the &s;everal neighbour|ing kingdoms &s;uffer, by turns, all of horrors of war, this favoured nation enjoys the felicity of looking down with &s;ecurity upon the various tempe&s;ts that &s;hake the world around them.</P>
<P>The happine&s;s of a long peace, however, has neither broken the &s;pirit nor enervated the arm of the Swi&s;s. The youths are diligently trained to martial exerci&s;es, &s;uch as running, wre&s;tling, and &s;hooting both with the cro&s;s-bow and mu&s;ket, a
<PB N="160" REF="161">
con&s;iderable number of well-di&s;ciplined troops are always employed in foreign &s;ervice; and the whole people are enrolled, and regularly exerci&s;ed in their re&s;pective militias. By the&s;e means they are ca|pable of collecting a very re&s;pectable body of forces, which would prove formidable to any enemy who &s;hould invade their country, or attack their liberties. Thus whil&s;t mo&s;t of the other &s;tates on the continent are tending towards a military govern|ment, Switzerland alone has no &s;tanding armies; and yet, from the nature of its &s;ituation, from its particular alliances, and from the policy of its in|ternal government, is more &s;ecure from inva&s;ion than any other European power.</P>
<P>The felicity of Switzerland, however, does not con&s;i&s;t merely in this peculiar exemption from the burdens and mi&s;eries of war; as there is no country in which happine&s;s and content more univer&s;ally prevail among the people. For whether the go|vernment is ari&s;tocratical, democratical, or mixed; a general &s;pirit of liberty pervades and actuates the &s;everal con&s;titutions: &s;o that even the oligarchical &s;tates which are u&s;ually the mo&s;t tyrannical, are here peculiarly mild; and the property of the &s;ubject is in general &s;ecurely guarded again&s;t every kind of violation.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162">This, &s;ays <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> mu&s;t be chiefly a&s;cribed to the nature of the people, and the con&s;titution of their governments. Were the Swi&s;s animated by zeal or ambition, &s;ome or other of their &s;tates would immediately break in upon the re&s;t; or were the &s;tates &s;o many principalities, they might often have an ambitious &s;overeign at the head of them, that would embroil his neighbours, and &s;acrifice the repo&s;e of his &s;ubjects to his own glory. But as the inhabitants of the&s;e countries are naturally of a heavy phlegmatic temper; if any of their leading members have more fire and &s;pirit than comes to their &s;hare, it is quickly tempered by the coldne&s;s and moderation of the re&s;t, who &s;it at the helm with them. To this we may add, that the Alps is the wor&s;t &s;pot of ground in the world to make con|que&s;ts, a great part of its governments being &s;o naturally intrenched among woods and mountains. However, we find no &s;uch di&s;orders among them, as we would expect in &s;uch a multitude of &s;tates; for as &s;oon as any public rupture happens, it is im|mediately clo&s;ed up by the moderation and good offices of the re&s;t who interfere.</P>
<P>As all the con&s;iderable governments among the Alps are commonwealths, &s;o indeed it is a con&s;ti|tution the mo&s;t adapted of any other to the poverty and barrenne&s;s of the&s;e countries. We may &s;ee
<PB N="162" REF="163">
only in a neighbouring government the ill con&s;e|quences of having a de&s;potic prince, in a &s;tate that is mo&s;t of it compo&s;ed of rocks and mountains; for, notwith&s;tanding there is a va&s;t extent of lands, and many of them better than tho&s;e of the Swi&s;s and Gri&s;ons, the common people among the latter are much more at their ea&s;e, and in a greater affluence of all the conveniencies of life. A prince's court generally introduces a kind of luxury and magnificence, that &s;ets every particular per&s;on upon making a higher figure in his &s;tation, than is gene|rally con&s;i&s;tent with his revenue.</P>
<P>It is the great endeavour of the &s;everal cantons of Switzerland, to bani&s;h from among them every thing that looks like pomp or &s;uperfluity. To this end the mini&s;ters are always preaching, and the governors putting out edicts again&s;t gaming, enter|tainments and fine cloaths. This is become more nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ome of the governments, &s;ince there have been &s;o many refugees &s;ettled among them; for though the prote&s;tants in France affect ordina|rily a greater plainne&s;s and &s;implicity of manners, than tho&s;e of the &s;ame quality who are of the Roman catholic communion, they have however too much of their country-gallantry for the genius and con|&s;titution of Switzerland. Should dre&s;&s;ing, fea&s;ting, and balls once get among the cantons, their military
<PB N="163" REF="164">
roughne&s;s would be quickly lo&s;t, their tempers would grow too &s;oft for their climate, and their expences outrun their income be&s;ides, the materials for their luxury mu&s;t be brought from other nations, which would immediately ruin a country that has few commodities of its own to export, and is not over&s;tocked with money. Luxury indeed wounds a republic in its very vitals, as its natural con&s;equences are rapine, avarice, and in|ju&s;tice; for the more money a man &s;pends, the more mu&s;t he endeavour to augment his &s;tock; which at la&s;t &s;ets the liberty and votes of a commonwealth to &s;ale, if they find any foreign power that is able to pay the price of them. We &s;ee no where the pernicious effects of luxury on a republic, more than in that of the ancient Romans, who immedi|ately found it&s;elf poor, as &s;oon as this vice got footing among them, though they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the riches in the world. We find in the be|ginnings and increa&s;es of their commonwealth&punc; &s;trange in&s;tances of the contempt of money, be|cau&s;e indeed they were utter &s;trangers to the plea&s;ures that might be procured by it; or, in other words, becau&s;e they were wholly ignorant of the acts of luxury. But as &s;oon as they once entered into a ta&s;te for plea&s;ure, politene&s;s, and magnificence, they fell into a thou&s;and violencies, con&s;piracies, and divi&s;ions, that threw them into all
<PB N="164" REF="165">
the di&s;orders imaginable, and terminated in the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of the commonwealth. It is no wonder, therefore, the poor commonwealths of Switzerland are ever labouring at the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion and prohibition of every thing that may intro|duce variety and luxury. Be&s;ides the &s;everal fines that are &s;et upon plays, games, balls, and fea&s;tings, they have many cu&s;toms among them which very much contribute to the keeping up of their ancient &s;implicity. The bourgeois who are at the head of the governments, are obliged to appear at all their public a&s;&s;emblies in a black cloak and a band. The women's dre&s;s is very plain, tho&s;e of the be&s;t quality wearing nothing on their heads generally but furs, which are to be met with in their own country. The per&s;ons of different qualities in both &s;exes, are indeed allowed their different ornaments, but the&s;e are generally &s;uch as are by no means co&s;tly, being rather de&s;igned as marks of di&s;tinction, than to make a figure. The chief officers of Berne, for example, are known by the crown of their hats, which are much deeper than tho&s;e of an inferior character. The pea&s;ants are generally cloathed in a coar&s;e kind of canvas, the manufacture of their own country. Their holy-day cloaths go from father to &s;on, and are &s;eldom worn out, till the &s;econd or third genera|tion: &s;o that it is common enough to &s;ee a country|man
<PB N="165" REF="166">
in the doublet and breeches of his great grand|father.</P>
<P>Geneva is much politer than Switzerland, or any of its allies, and is therefore looked upon as the court of the Alps, whither the prote&s;tant cantons often &s;end their children to improve them&s;elves in language and education. The Genevois have been very much refined; or, as others will have it, very much corrupted by the conver&s;ation of the French prote&s;tants, who make up almo&s;t a third of their people. It is certain they have very much forgotten the advice that <HI>Calvin</HI> formerly gave them in a great council a little before his death, when he re|commended to them above all things an exemplary mode&s;ty and humility, and as great a &s;implicity in their manners as in their religion.</P>
<P>In the times even of <HI>Cato</HI> the cen&s;or, the Appian law was not better ob&s;erved at Rome, than the &s;umptuary laws are at pre&s;ent in Switzerland. One is a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;ays de <HI>Langle,</HI> how &s;umptuary laws can be e&s;tabli&s;hed without driving the faire&s;t part of the human race into rebellion again&s;t tyranny! It is difficult to conceive how it has happened, that the ladies have &s;ubmitted to tho&s;e cruel and childi&s;h prohibitions; and by what means it came about,
<PB N="166" REF="167">
that in Switzerland, as el&s;ewhere, the fair &s;ex do not make the la&s;h?</P>
<P>Feathers and artificial flowers are &s;trictly for|bidden. It is in vain that the women complain, murmur, and make a horrible noi&s;e; there is no gallant &s;enator, who will ever elevate his voice in their favour; and imitating the example of the Tribune <HI>Valerius,</HI> plead as proxy for the ladies, in behalf of trinkets, feathers, and new fa&s;hions.</P>
<P>Were it not for tho&s;e cruel prohibitions, French baubles would find a ready market in Switzerland. The young women &s;eem to devour them with their eyes, and &s;peak with raptures of France, and more particularly of Paris; for Paris is the capital of women; it is there that the female Swedes, Spaniards, and Italian run, to learn how to govern men with ribbands and laces; it is there that the female pa|ri&s;ians reign, in the mid&s;t of fooli&s;h fa&s;hions, by means of charms ever varying, ever new&mdash;and it is there that the Engli&s;h kneel, and throw away their money and their melancholy.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who have re&s;ided for any con&s;iderable time in Switzerland, it is quickly perceptible, adds de <HI>Langle,</HI> how much the republican &s;pirit of its inhabitants has univer&s;ally degenerated. The Athe|nians,
<PB N="167" REF="168">

The women are en|tirely bani&s;hed from their clubs, or a&s;&s;emblies. A &s;ociety without women!&mdash;There is nothing there but wine, brandy and other &s;pirituous liquors, calcu|lated to cha&s;e away care; but the remedy is wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e!</P>
<P>It is e&s;pecially in the little cantons, that this cu&s;tom is the mo&s;t ob&s;ervable. The two &s;exes have there almo&s;t become utter &s;trangers, and en|tirely unacquainted with each other. If the hu&s;|band &s;peaks to his wife five or &s;ix times in the cour&s;e of the year, it is the mo&s;t that is expected.

<P><PB N="168" REF="169">The luxury of Switzerland con&s;i&s;ts in the plea|&s;ures of the table; the people look upon good cheer as the greate&s;t of all ble&s;&s;ings:&mdash;the reports, in|deed, do not re&s;emble tho&s;e of <HI>Lafare</HI> and <HI>Chaulieu;</HI> the gue&s;ts, however, neither eat nor drink, le&s;s than they did. <HI>Sylvius,</HI> the celebrated phy&s;ician of Paris, who recommended to his patients to get drunk four times a week, would have made his fortune in this part of the world. Next to Germany, Switzerland is the country where they drink mo&s;t; the cha|racter of a <HI>hard-drinker</HI> is actually a recommendation there. In a great number of the cantons, they &s;till repeat with admiration, the &s;tory of an amba&s;&s;ador from France; who, on returning home to his own court, prepared to take leave of the deputies:&mdash; "Your Excellency," &s;aid their magi&s;trate, "mu&s;t not depart without drinking &s;ome of the wine of Etrier." "The wine of Etrier," replies the am|ba&s;&s;ador, "ought to be drunk out of a boot;" and immediately pulling off one of his own, he fills and empties it in an in&s;tant, &s;prings into his &s;addle, and rides away with the &s;wiftne&s;s of an arrow.</P>
<P>We perhaps condemn, without &s;ufficient reflec|tion, the too liberal u&s;e of wine among the Swi&s;s. It may be to the juice of the grape, that they are indebted for many of their be&s;t qualities. It is commonly remarked, that drunkards are very good
<PB N="169" REF="170">
&s;ort of people;&mdash;that they are incapable of hatred; &mdash;that their hearts are very &s;eldom corrupt or vi|cious;&mdash;that they are open and candid, and con|&s;equently very ea&s;y to be known.</P>
<P>In the juice of this berry from which coffee is made, &s;ays <HI>De Langle,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts the luxury of the people of Switzerland. On the top of their moun|tains&mdash;on the &s;ides of their &s;teep rocks&mdash;where the mo&s;t common refinement has not yet penetrated, and where the inhabitants have &s;till pre&s;erved the &s;implicity of their ancient manners, the cu&s;tom of drinking coffee is carried to exce&s;s; and it is not uncommon to &s;ee maid-&s;ervants, and female pea|&s;ants, pawning their petticoats and their &s;tays, to purcha&s;e &s;ugar to render it palatable. If the rage for this beverage is attended with &s;ome inconve|niences, it cannot on the other hand be doubted, but that the people are become much more &s;ober by its u&s;e; that drunkenne&s;s has become infinitely more uncommon &s;ince its introduction, and that it has effected what neither the fine harangues of <HI>Socrates,</HI> the epigrams of <HI>Martial,</HI> the di&s;cour&s;es of <HI>Seneca,</HI> in former times; or the be&s;t moral trea|ti&s;es, and the fine&s;t declamations on temperance in our own days have been able to accompli&s;h. Al|though coffee is familiar to mo&s;t of the inhabitants of the globe, and its u&s;e almo&s;t univer&s;al, were it
<PB N="170" REF="171">
&s;till more common, the taverns would have le&s;s company, and the artizans and labourers in great cities might by little and little leave off the cu&s;tom of &s;pending, in two or three hours, the price of fifteen or twenty pounds of breads, which would maintain a whole family for a week.</P>
<P>A friend of <HI>Socrates</HI> complained, that provi&s;ions were exceedingly dear at Athens. The wine of Chio was fifty livres a bottle, honey in proportion, a fi&s;h twenty deniers; and as to cinnamon, it was &s;old at a mo&s;t extravagant price. <HI>Socrates</HI> on this, conducted his friend to the place where hydromel and cummin were &s;old; the&s;e might be procured for a trifle. It is ju&s;t the &s;ame in Switzerland; the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life may be had cheap; luxuries alone are expen&s;ive: one may live there on a very &s;mall nnu|ity, and the man of forty crowns per annum, an imaginary character, drawn by the ma&s;terly pen of <HI>Voltaire,</HI> could very ea&s;ily have enjoyed his four meals a day in that country.</P>
<P>A real mi&s;anthrope is a mon&s;ter unknown to na|ture; for nature never made one. And yet not|with&s;tanding this, the Swi&s;s, with a few exceptions, are melancholy, taciturn, fond of &s;eque&s;tered and peaceable retreats, and &s;eem not to indulge in the gay &s;allies of wit and enjoyment. It is undoubtedly
<PB N="171" REF="172">
the awful appearance of the mountains, the preci|pices, and the avalanches, that they have continu|ally before their eyes, which intimidates and pre|vents them from laughing. Their women are more courageous; neither the glaciers, the rocks, nor the mountains make any impre&s;&s;ion on them. Almo&s;t all the women in Switzerland are lively, and are as playful as kittens; a little ball will amu&s;e them; even a butterfly will divert and make them laugh. The men in Switzerland, in general, exhibit a cer|tain degree of melancholy in all their motions, even in their dancing; they are leaden heeled and have no ear.</P>
<P>The women, on the contrary, dance with great vivacity, are quick in all their motions, light, lively, and always in the air; it &s;eems as if the earth burnt their feet. It is improper, however, remarks <HI>de Langle,</HI> that they &s;hould dance with downca&s;t eyes, without ever looking at their part|ners.</P>
<P>This mode&s;ty and re&s;erve, &s;o commendable at church, at table, or in any other a&s;&s;embly, ought to be entirely bani&s;hed from the ball-room. Amorous looks, friendly &s;queezes of the hand, even ki&s;&s;es them&s;elves, animate a ball, render it more agree|able, and never give occa&s;ion for &s;candal:&mdash;the

violin, the clarinet, the tamborine, and the flagelet, purify every thing.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who pre&s;ide over this part of education, ought to command their pupils to &s;mile at every &s;tep. There is nothing in the world more unnatu|ral than to &s;ee an Engli&s;hman put on a &s;erious and &s;ulky appearance amid&s;t the quick tunes of an allemande; black and white, night and day, form le&s;s outrageous contra&s;ts!</P>
<P>The frivolity, however, which we have noticed among the Swi&s;s ladies is only in appearance. Swit|zerland is the country of all others, where the women, in general, conver&s;e mo&s;t naturally, mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly, and know, on proper occa&s;ions, how to give the be&s;t advice. They are well educated, and are endowed with uncommon accompli&s;hments; poetry, hi&s;tory, philo&s;ophy, even politics are within the &s;phere of their knowledge; and indeed nothing appears difficult to their comprehen&s;ion. They are al&s;o fond of the fine arts, and excel the acquire|ments adapted to the fair &s;ex. Mo&s;t of them play upon &s;ome in&s;trument, dance, ride on hor&s;eback, and &s;ing like &s;o many larks.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions are very violent in Switzerland, but the ladies are &s;o &s;avagely virtuous, adds <HI>de Langle,</HI>

<P>The courtezans of Berne are the hand&s;ome&s;t women in all Europe.

<P>With re&s;pect to the men, it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged that notwith&s;tanding the &s;ombre appearance of their a&s;pect, it is ea&s;y to di&s;cern among the Swi&s;s a degree of &s;implicity and integrity, that renders all intercour&s;e with them &s;afe. E&s;timable on account of a thou&s;and good qualities, the people of Switzerland will be found to po&s;&s;e&s;s a more pure &s;y&s;tem of morals than any where el&s;e. Di&s;cretion is their favourite quality;&mdash;as much to be tru&s;ted as &s;ilence it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Though they have been calumniated by tho&s;e, who, on account of a few uncommon in&s;tances of par&s;imony, have not been a&s;hamed to accu&s;e the whole nation of a &s;ordid avarice; and of making
<PB N="174" REF="175">
u&s;e of unju&s;tifiable means of procuring wealth. Yet no nation is in general more generous and more ho&s;pitable than they are. There are a great number of charitable a&s;ylums to be found in every part of Switzerland; a prodigious multitude of alms-hou&s;es for the maintenance of the aged; many foundations for the accommodation of the unfor|tunate, and more e&s;pecially for the reception of pregnant women.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e charitable in&s;titutions, a more re|putable one never exi&s;ted in any part of the globe, &s;ince mankind, abjuring the &s;tate of nature, have united together, than that of the &s;ociety of <HI>emulation</HI> and <HI>compa&s;&s;ion</HI> at Ba&s;le.

All the members who compo&s;e this amiable confraternity, are citizens di&s;tingui&s;hed by their humanity, by the purity of their manners, and by never having incurred the cen&s;ure of the public, genteel families, who have fallen into indigence:&mdash;young women whom mi&s;|fortunes might have led to di&s;honour;&mdash;the &s;hop|keeper&mdash;the mechanic, burthened with a numerous family of children;&mdash;widows&mdash;orphans; and more particularly the inhabitants of the adjoining country,

are the objects of their paternal &s;olicitude: It is from the&s;e circum&s;tances that the appearance of mi&s;ery never &s;hocks the eye of a &s;tranger in the cantons of Switzerland.</P>

<P>The inhabitants of one half of Switzerland profe&s;s the prote&s;tant religion. It was <HI>Zinglius, Bucer,</HI> and <HI>Brilinger,</HI> who may be reckoned the authors of the reformation in Switzerland: it was they who fir&s;t dared to deny the infallibility of the Pope, to brave his anathemas, his keys, and his triple crown!
<PB N="176" REF="177">

<P>It was about this period that the prote&s;tant can|ton, by an edict, prohibited every one from &s;aying any thing of God, either good, bad, or indifferent; and it was in the mid&s;t of the&s;e troubles, occa&s;ioned by the reformation, that the inhabitants of Ba&s;le in their fury precipitated the legate of Pope XXII from the top of a terrace!</P>
<P>The&s;e times are no more! Europe has a&s;&s;umed a new appearance;&mdash;Fanatici&s;m no longer occa&s;ions the death of any one!&mdash;Although the reformed is the national and prevailing religion in the prote&s;tant cantons, yet all &s;ects are tolerated, all communions admitted, and all kinds of wor&s;hip are allowed. At Berne, at Zuric, and at Neuchatel, there are a great number of Papi&s;ts, of Anabapti&s;ts, and Mo|ravians. The Pre-adamites al&s;o have made a great

progre&s;s there, and have already acquired a number of pro&s;elytes. They boldly affirm, that the world has exi&s;ted from all eternity; that warmth, cold, dry, and wit, have never been confounded; and yet the words chaos, matter, &amp;c. are only poetical terms for night and day.</P>
<P>Though the government of Switzerland allows to all &s;ects the liberty of thinking, of praying, and of wor&s;hipping God, after their own particular fancy, yet the Catholics have not any churches in the pro|te&s;tant cantons. Be&s;ides, the enigmatical and my&s;terious foundation of the Roman faith has always appeared to them to be whim&s;ical, and beyond the reach of human belief. The prie&s;ts and monks have been the cau&s;e of mo&s;t of the in&s;urrections in Swit|zerland; the remembrance of their rapacity, of their lu&s;t, and their depraved manners, is &s;till &s;o fre&s;h, and, as it were, yet bleeding in their memory; in fine, crimes of every &s;pecies have &s;o often pro|faned the &s;anctuary, and &s;ullied the prie&s;thood in this country, that the reformed &s;till continue to regard the Roman faith as a rotten branch of chri&s;tianity!</P>
<P>The churches of the reformed religion are entirely de&s;titute of ornament; as to the cathedrals, they are models of Gothic architecture. The buildings in
<PB N="178" REF="179">
no country better demon&s;trate how much the arti&s;ts of the 11th, the 12th, and the 13th centuries ex|celled in carving, in de&s;ign in general, and in ma|je&s;ty and grandeur in particular. Within the pro|te&s;tant church all is &s;implicity: one neither &s;ees gold nor rubies; there are only a few benches and chairs, and a pulpit and communion table.</P>
<P>This kind of wor&s;hip is too naked; Religion &s;tands in need of drapery and machinery;&mdash;the re|formed &s;hould admit ornaments and pictures into their temples; and, above all, mu&s;ic, to inflame the imagination, and rai&s;e the &s;oul to the Divinity. The people ought to be &s;oothed with the maje&s;ty of ceremonies, the vapour of incen&s;e, and the melody of in&s;truments, and of the human voice. Sumptu|ous as was the temple of Solomon, it might per|haps have remained empty, had it not re-echoed night and day with the &s;ongs and in&s;truments of the daughter of Sion!</P>
<P>While &s;peaking of the holy place&mdash;while &s;peak|ing of the &s;acred ceremonies;&mdash;in the mid&s;t of the cares that &s;urrounded his throne&mdash;in the mid&s;t even of his mo&s;t brilliant victories, <HI>David</HI> always thinks on concerts of harmony, and of mu&s;ic, and demands continually, that his &s;ongs may be accompanied by the harp, the cymbal, the organ, and the trumpet!</P>

<P>It is the &s;trong belief of a re&s;urrection&mdash;it is the certainty of being more happy&mdash;it is the &s;olacing idea that their friends and relations are &s;till in ex|i&s;tence, and that they &s;hall enjoy hereafter the plea|&s;ure of their intercour&s;e and &s;ociety, that &s;oftens the horrors of death among the&s;e people&mdash;that en|ables them to look it in the face without trembling, and without growing pale, and makes them play, as it were, with it, in the &s;ame manner as the pea&s;ants of Bohemia and the Tyrol do with &s;erpents, notwith|&s;tanding

their enormous thickne&s;s, their frightful hi&s;&s;es, and their flame-coloured eyes.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more &s;imple than the funerals in this country are. The Swi&s;s, more rea&s;onable than any other nation, think it is ridiculous to e&s;cort with pomp, and to inter, with idle and u&s;ele&s;s ceremony, a ma&s;s of fle&s;h without life, &s;tranger to all that pa&s;&s;es concerning it, and ignorant whether they laugh or cry around his coffin. There is neither wax tapers nor coffin: the dead corp&s;e being covered with &s;traw, is thrown into a cart, and the driver whips on to the church-yard. The ob&s;equies of the magi&s;trates are performed rather a little le&s;s cava|lierly: their bodies are carried by bearers; their brother magi&s;trates and their relations follow in prece&s;&s;ion; a large cloak covers the corp&s;e from head to foot: a &s;treamer of crape floats behind it in the air, and a huge flapped hat &s;hades the face from the light of heaven! All the burial places are without the gates of the cities and towns. The mo&s;t ab&s;olute democracy reigns in them: the rich man and the beggar, the &s;ervant and the ma&s;ter, confounded one with the other, rot in conjunc|tion.</P>
<P>After the example of the Greeks and Romans, the Swi&s;s choo&s;e to live among the dead;&mdash;like
<PB N="181" REF="182">
them, they make the church-yards their favourite walks; like them, they plant the&s;e &s;pots with &s;yca|mores, with cypre&s;&s;es, and other melancholy trees, which recall the idea of death, and invite affliction, to repo&s;e under their &s;hade.</P>
<P>The Swi&s;s, &s;ays <HI>de Langle,</HI> do not pay obedience to that wi&s;e precept of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> "Keep your dead for three days"! At Zuric, at Berne, and among the little cantons, if you happen to &s;leep a little longer than u&s;ual, they think you dead, and inter you im|mediately. In the canton of Berne more e&s;pecially, a &s;ick man &s;carcely appears to utter his la&s;t &s;igh, when the people begin to &s;trip him. They are con|tented with &s;imply feeling his pul&s;e, with applying their hand to his brea&s;t, or pre&s;enting a gla&s;s to his lips, to di&s;cover if he yet breathes!</P>
<P>Among other unfortunate people, who have been heard to cry from within their coffin, "Where are you carrying me, I am not dead;" the people there &s;till recollect and repeat with great commi&s;eration, the &s;tory of Madame <HI>Langhans,</HI> who was actually buried alive! The tomb of this lady, remarks <HI>de Langle,</HI> as well as <HI>Coxe,</HI> is worthy of in&s;pection. The monument is placed on the ground, as we ob|&s;erved when &s;peaking of Berne, and repre&s;ents a grave, covered with a broken tomb-&s;tone. Ma|dame
<PB N="182" REF="183">
<HI>Langhans</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have heard the trumpet that is to proclaim the day of judgment, to have awoke at its &s;ound, to have torn her winding &s;heet, and to have ari&s;en from her grave, to take her place in the cele&s;tial man&s;ions.</P>
<P>This compo&s;ition, at once warm and original in this conception, equally &s;imple and &s;ublime, and for the idea of which, we &s;hall in vain &s;earch <HI>Homer, Pindar,</HI> and all the poets, both ancient and modern, electrifies and excites our attention in an uncommon degree.</P>
<P>This monument, remarks <HI>de Langle,</HI> is the pro|duction of M. <HI>Nahl,</HI> a young &s;culptor of Sweden, who, after having travelled throughout Europe, and di&s;played every where the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing proofs of the warmth and originality of his genius, went to London, where he died a pri&s;oner for debt!</P>
<P>How often in his life time, may not the man of genius exclaim, "My kingdom is not of this world!" He who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a mediocrity of talents, is the man who is beloved. We fly from and hate the man of penetration, and the man of abilities; we dread his piercing eye; we would willingly de&s;troy him; he re&s;embles a trouble&s;ome neighbour, who&s;e windows overlook our own apartments!</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184">The Swedi&s;h arti&s;ts, remarks <HI>de Langle,</HI> are not fortunate, when they leave their own country.

This young man was endowed with one quality, equally amiable and intere&s;ting. His humanity was &s;uch, that he never put his money, when he had any, in his pocket: he always held it in his hand, that he might not hear a recapitulation of the mi&s;eries of tho&s;e who addre&s;&s;ed him for cha|rity!</P>
<P>The pri&s;ons in Switzerland, ought to &s;erve as a model for all the pri&s;ons in Europe. They are large, healthy, well aired, and each apartment con|tains a bed, a little &s;tove, a window, and a night chair. The pri&s;oners receive a pound and a half of bread, and a certain quantity of fle&s;h, or of grains daily. They have clean linen once a week, and cloaths when they are wanted. The petty rogues are &s;eparate from the criminals, committed for atro|cious offences, and each pri&s;on has an ho&s;pital or infirmary attached to it. The u&s;e of &s;pirituous li|quors is prohibited. We never &s;ee in Switzerland, as el&s;ewhere, tho&s;e barbarous gaolers, who make the very air on which their pri&s;oners re&s;pire, venal, and
<PB N="184" REF="185">
&s;ell to them at an exorbitant price, the &s;tinking &s;traw on which they are permitted to repo&s;e!</P>
<P>The u&s;e of dungeons is unknown in Switzerland, and ought to be pro&s;cribed in every part of the globe. When a pri&s;oner is enclo&s;ed and chained, when the doors are well locked and barred, flight is impracti|cable, and it is out of the power of fortune to con|trive an e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Whoever does not intend to commit inju&s;tice, or to make law-&s;uits immortal, ought to give judgment in public, &s;ays a King of Macedonia. The Swi&s;s, who adhere to this maxim, try all their criminals in the open air. Civil cau&s;es are canva&s;&s;ed privately: but the parties never langui&s;h under the tortures of &s;u&s;pence; for this people &s;eem to have taken the prompt deci&s;ions of the Athenians, and the Roman tribunals as their models.</P>
<P>The puni&s;hment of death is almo&s;t fallen into di&s;|u&s;e; the people talk of an execution for ten years after it has taken place. In Switzerland, they are economical of human blood. The magi&s;trates ap|pear to be actuated by the maxim which inculcates that, &s;ociety ought not to cut off one of its members for a &s;light offence.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="186">In&s;tead of being &s;ubjected to capital puni&s;hments, felons are impri&s;oned in the hou&s;e of correction. The regulations in the&s;e hou&s;es are &s;o excellent and &s;o mild, criminals are &s;o well fed, and &s;o well at|tended, that if it were not for the iron ring about the leg, the hook at the neck, and the chain by which they are linked together, many worthy people who are in poverty, would be very happy in their &s;itua|tion.</P>
<P>If the atrocity of a crime &s;hould oblige the judges to pronounce &s;entence of death, the cord is the only in&s;trument of puni&s;hment; &s;o humane are they, that the culprit is fir&s;t made drunk, and then is hanged, as it were, without perceiving it, he has no more idea of the death he is to &s;uffer, than an oak about to be cut down, has of its de&s;truction!</P>
<P>The Swi&s;s, &s;ays <HI>de Langle,</HI> carry on &s;uch an im|men&s;e trade in printed calicoes and ribbands, that they may be &s;aid to furni&s;h half the world with top|knots, cloaks, and petticoats. <HI>Sully,</HI> the Mi|ni&s;ter of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. looked on tho&s;e men as fools, who pretended to an uncommon &s;hare of intrepidity, by having doubled the Cape of Good Hope; <HI>Sully,</HI> who a&s;&s;igned to manufactures the la&s;t rank in poli|tical economy, who preferred the mo&s;t common fruit and pul&s;e, to all the &s;carce and co&s;tly produc|tions

that the Indies could boa&s;t; has advi&s;ed the Swi&s;s to abandon their looms, and betake them&s;elves to the plough. For want of labourers, one half of their country remains uncultivated; they, however, de&s;pi&s;e the earth, di&s;dain its productions, and think that agriculture would di&s;honour them!</P>
<P>From hence proceeds the nece&s;&s;ity of importing, at a great expence, from the Milane&s;e, from France, from Al&s;ace, from the circle of Swabia, and the mar|qui&s;ate of Baden, corn, eatables, and provi&s;ions of all kinds, which the delicate hands of the inhabi|tants di&s;dain to procure for them&s;elves. From hence proceed tho&s;e heaths, which &s;eem to have no end; from hence tho&s;e putrid and exten&s;ive marches, which are to be met with, particularly in the canton of Berne, which by means of their pe&s;ti|lential vapours and unhealthy fogs, de&s;troy a number of children annually.</P>
<P>The cultivation of the earth has not always been de&s;pi&s;ed in Switzerland; for their hi&s;torians recite the following anecdote, with no &s;mall &s;hare of pride.</P>
<P>A Duke of Au&s;tria, while travelling on hor&s;eback in the canton of Zuric, &s;aw, near to the high road, four noble hor&s;es harne&s;&s;ed to a plough; a youth,
<PB N="187" REF="188">
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a charming per&s;on, directed their mo|tions, while an old man, who&s;e hair was whitened by age, opened the furrows. Surpri&s;ed at the &s;uperior air of the two labourers, no le&s;s than at the beauty of the cattle, the Duke &s;topped, and turning toward the Grand Ma&s;ter of his hou&s;ehold, &s;aid, "I have never &s;een &s;uch re&s;pectable pea&s;ants, or &s;uch fine hor&s;es before." "Be not a&s;toni&s;hed, my Lord," re|plies this officer, "the&s;e are the Baron <HI>de Hugi</HI> and his &s;on; behold, at the foot of yonder hill, is the ancient ca&s;tle belonging to their family; and if you are &s;till in doubt, to-morrow you will &s;ee them come to do homage to you."</P>
<P>Accordingly, on the next day, the Duke perceives the &s;ame labourers arrive on hor&s;eback at his court, attended by a numerous retinue of their va&s;&s;als. After the baron had paid the u&s;ual homage to the &s;overeign, he pre&s;ented his &s;on to him, and entered into conver&s;ation. The Duke being unable to &s;tifle his curio&s;ity, &s;eized on this opportunity to &s;atisfy his impatience. "Was it you," &s;aid he, "whom I &s;aw near to the highway, holding a plough &s;uperbly decorated?" "Yes my Lord," replies the Baron, "next to a war, undertaken for the defence of one's country, I know of no occupation more honourable for a gentleman, than that of cultivating his own e&s;tates; I, therefore, do this, as an example to my &s;on,"</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="189">Thus thought, and thus acted the ancient Swi&s;s, who equalling the Romans in their courage, re&s;em|ble them al&s;o in their ta&s;te for agriculture, and a country life. The &s;ame hands that wielded the lance or carried the banner, thought not them&s;elves di&s;honoured by u&s;ing the &s;pade, and brightening the plough-&s;hare. More than once, in the mid&s;t of the Alps, and at the foot of Mount Jura, as well as on the banks of the Tiber, the General has been &s;een leav|ing his plough, to repel, at the head of his equals, the enemies of his country; and returning triumph|ant, he has been known to follow his &s;u&s;pended la|bours with additional ardour. One may &s;ee from hence, that a &s;tate may be as much indebted for its pro&s;perity to <HI>Ceres,</HI> as to <HI>Bellona.</HI></P>
<P>But it is more e&s;pecially in an age, when agricul|ture appears to be honoured, and when economical &s;ocieties are every where occupied in di&s;&s;ertations and ob&s;ervations, that the people of Switzerland &s;hould be &s;o neglectful of their mar&s;hes. There is no land, however barren it is, or however much it may be covered with briars and thorns, but the &s;pade or the hedging bill will make it wave with a golden harve&s;t, or bloom with ro&s;es.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Situation, Extent, Air, Soil, Productions, and Population.</HEAD>
<P>CORSICA is an i&s;land of the Mediterranean &s;ea, &s;ituated between the 41&s;t and 43d degree of north latitude, and between the 8th and 10th degree of ea&s;t longitude. It has on the north, the Ligurian &s;ea, and gulph of Genoa. On the ea&s;t, the Tu&s;can &s;ea; on the &s;outh, a &s;trait of ten miles, which &s;eparates it from Sardinia; and on the we&s;t, the Mediterranean. It is about 100 miles &s;outh of Genoa; and 80 &s;outh-we&s;t of Leghorn, from whence it can plainly be &s;een when the weather is clear. It is 150 miles in length, and from 40 to 50 in breadth, being broade&s;t about the middle. It is reckoned 300 miles in circumfer|ence; but an exact mea&s;urement around it, would
<PB N="190" REF="192">
extend to 500 miles, as it is edged with many pro|montories, and with a variety of bays.</P>
<P><HI>Pliny,</HI> the elder, hath given us a &s;hort, but very ac|curate account of the geography of Cor&s;ica. It ex|tendeth from north to &s;outh, and is about 150 miles in length, for the mo&s;t part 50 in breadth, and 322 in circumference. It hath 33 &s;tates, and two colonies; Mariana, founded by <HI>Marius,</HI> and Aleria, founded by the Dictator <HI>Sylla.</HI> Of the&s;e 33 &s;tates, not above five or &s;ix can now be traced; and the colonies are only to be marked by their ruins.</P>
<P><HI>Seneca,</HI> the philo&s;opher, hath left us two mo&s;t hor|rid pictures of Cor&s;ica, very fal&s;e indeed, but exe|cuted with uncommon &s;trength of fancy and expre&s;|&s;ion. Stoic as he was, of a grave and &s;evere demea|nour, he did not e&s;cape the Emperor's jealou&s;y, but being accu&s;ed as one of the many gallants with whom the profligate <HI>Julia</HI> had been guilty of adulte|ry, he was bani&s;hed to Cor&s;ica, where he remained for &s;even years; and when in the province of Cape Cor&s;o, they &s;till &s;hew an old ruin, called <HI>Seneca's</HI> tower. Here he compo&s;ed his book <HI>de Con&s;olatione</HI> to <HI>Polybius,</HI> and his mother <HI>Helvia,</HI> with &s;everal other works; and here he indulged his fretted imagina|tion, in epigrams full of &s;pleen, again&s;t the place of his exile. He hath al&s;o vented his &s;pleen in the
<PB N="191" REF="193">
&s;ame extravagant manner in his books <HI>de Con&s;olatione,</HI> But we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that, notwith&s;tanding all the firmne&s;s of <HI>Seneca,</HI> his mind was then clouded with melancholy, and every object around him, appeared in rueful colours.</P>
<P>Cor&s;ica is in reality, a mo&s;t agreeable i&s;land. It had from the ancient Greeks, the name of <HI>Kalli&s;ta,</HI> on account of its beauty; and we may believe it was held in con&s;iderable e&s;timation, &s;ince <HI>Callimachus</HI> places it next to his favourite Delus.</P>
<P>It is charmingly &s;ituated in the Mediterranean, from whence continual breezes fan and cool it in &s;ummer, and the &s;urrounding body of water keeps it warm in winter, &s;o that it is one of the mo&s;t tem|perate countries in that part of the globe. Its air is fre&s;h and healthful, except in one or two places, which are moi&s;t, and where the air, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer, is &s;uffocating and &s;ickly; but in general, the Cor&s;icans breathe a pure atmo&s;phere, which is al&s;o keen enough to brace their fibres, more than one would expect under &s;o warm a &s;un.</P>
<P>This i&s;land was anciently a &s;mall kingdom, and in the year 806, was conquered by the Genoe&s;e, who drove the Saracens out of it. In the eleventh cen|tury, the i&s;land was taken from them by the Pi&s;ane&s;e.
<PB N="192" REF="194">
In the 15th century, the Genoe&s;e again got po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of it. They have &s;ince been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it at different times by other powers; but this i&s;land has always been ceded to them again, till within the&s;e few years, when Genoa finding the Cor&s;icans di&s;|contented with their government, &s;urrendered its right to the King of France, under who&s;e dominions it continued during the French Monarch, but on the revolution of this country, the Cor&s;icans in a formal manner, reque&s;ted the protection of England, and &s;urrendered its crown to the King of Britain, and it is now governed by a Viceroy.</P>
<P>Cor&s;ica has indeed been pretty generally repre|&s;ented as unwhole&s;ome, which perhaps has been ow|ing to the bad report given of it by the Romans, who e&s;tabli&s;hed their colonies at Aleria and Mari|ana, which from their damp &s;ituation, occa&s;ioned a great death among the inhabitants, and accordingly, the&s;e colonies &s;oon went to ruin. But all the interior parts of the i&s;land, have very good air.</P>
<P>This i&s;land is remarkably well furni&s;hed with good harbours, &s;o that we may apply to it, what <HI>Florus</HI> &s;ays of the Campania, <HI>'Nihil ho&s;pitalius mari!'</HI> No|thing more ho&s;pitable to the &s;ea. It has on the north, Centuri; on the we&s;t, San Fiorenzo, I&s;ola Ro&s;&s;a, Calvi, and Ajaccio; on the &s;outh, it has Bo|nifaccio;
<PB N="193" REF="195">
and on the ea&s;t, Porto-beccio, Ba&s;tia, and Macinajo.</P>
<P><HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> celebrates Cor&s;ica for the excel|lence of its harbours. The i&s;land being of very ea&s;y acce&s;s, &s;ays this writer, has a mo&s;t beautiful port, called the Syracu&s;ian. This, which was anciently called the Syracu&s;ian, has now the name of Porto Vecchio; of which it is proper to take particular notice.</P>
<P>Porto Vecchio is a &s;pacious haven, capable of con|taining a very large fleet. It is five miles long, above a mile and a half broad, has a great depth of water, and a good bottom, and being land-locked on every &s;ide, is well &s;heltered from &s;torms. Nature has al&s;o placed a high and rocky mountain, like a &s;tately column, to point it out at a great di&s;tance. In &s;hort, Porto Vecchio may vie with the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed harbours in Europe.</P>
<P>The only objection to it is, the badne&s;s of the air occa&s;ioned by the mar&s;hy grounds which lie in the neighbourhood. But this di&s;advantage may be re|medied, as has been done at Leghorn.</P>
<P>From this account of the harbour of Cor&s;ica, it will appear of how great con&s;equence an alliance with
<PB N="194" REF="196">
this i&s;land might be to any of the maritime powers of Europe. For, a fleet &s;tationed there, might command the navigation of Genoa, Tu&s;cany, and the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, that between Spain and Na|ples, and a good &s;hare of that to the Levant; not to mention its influence over that of Sardinia. And it may be material to ob&s;erve, that ve&s;&s;els &s;tationed in the ports of Cor&s;ica, might be formidable to France, as the we&s;tern &s;ide of the i&s;land is directly oppo&s;ite to the exten&s;ive coa&s;t of Province, on which a de&s;cent might be made with crui&s;ers in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P><HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> de&s;cribes Cor&s;ica as an exten&s;ive i&s;land, very mountainous, abounding in large fo|re&s;ts, and watered with many rivulets: indeed, the interior parts of the i&s;land, are in general mountain|ous, though inter&s;per&s;ed with fruitful valleys; but have a peculiar grand appearance, and in&s;pire one with the genius of the place, with that undaunted and inflexible &s;pirit, which will not bow to oppre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The great divi&s;ion of Cor&s;ica, is into the <HI>Di qua,</HI> and the <HI>Di la dei monti.</HI> The country on this &s;ide, and the country on the other &s;ide of the moun|tains, reckoning from Ba&s;tia. By the mountains, is under&s;tood that great range of them, which ri&s;es be|yond
<PB N="195" REF="197">
Aleria, and &s;tretches acro&s;s the i&s;land, inter&s;ect|ing it, however, by no means equally; for the country <HI>Di qua</HI> is a third more than that of <HI>Di la.</HI></P>
<P>Another divi&s;ion is into provinces, of which there are nine; for although a great part of this country long went under the denomination of <HI>Feudos,</HI> and is &s;till called &s;o in the maps, the juri&s;diction of the &s;ignors, is now gradually wearing out, and will &s;oon be &s;unk into the general power of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The next divi&s;ion of Cor&s;ica, is into <HI>Pieves.</HI> A pieve is properly an eccle&s;ia&s;tical appointment, con|taining a great number of pari&s;hes, over which is placed a <HI>Pievano,</HI> who &s;uperintends the prie&s;ts, and draws a certain part of the tithes. But this divi&s;ion is as much u&s;ed for civil affairs, as for tho&s;e of the church.</P>
<P>There are large tracts of uninhabited land in Cor|&s;ica, mo&s;tly covered with woods; to &s;ome parts of which, the pea&s;ants re&s;ort in &s;ummer to feed their flocks, and to gather che&s;nuts, making little &s;heds for them&s;elves to lie under. There is hardly &s;uch a thing, as a detached farm-hou&s;e to be &s;een in the i&s;land, like what are &s;cattered every where over Great Britain; for the Cor&s;icans gather together in little villages, which they call by corruption, <HI>Pae&s;es,</HI>
<PB N="196" REF="198">
countries. I remember, &s;ays <HI>Bo&s;well,</HI> when I was fir&s;t told that I &s;hould travel a great many miles without &s;eeing a country, I could not conceive what they meant. The Cor&s;icans are in greater &s;afety, and have more &s;ociety with each other by their liv|ing in villages, which is &s;till the cu&s;tom in the can|ton of Switzerland, and &s;ome parts of Germany, as it was anciently among all nations.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ican villages are frequently built on the very &s;ummit of their mountains, on craggy cliffs of &s;o &s;tupendous a height, that the hou&s;es can hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed during the day; but at night, when the &s;hepherds kindle their fires, the reflection of &s;uch a variety of lights, makes the&s;e aerial villages have a mo&s;t picture&s;que and plea&s;ing appearance.</P>
<P>Cor&s;ica is extremely well watered. Its principal lakes are tho&s;e of Ino and Crena, about two miles from each other; both &s;ituated on the highe&s;t moun|tain in the i&s;land, called by the ancients Mons Aureus, and now Monte Rotondo. It is of an amazing height, and may equal any of the Alps. From the top of it, there is a mo&s;t exten&s;ive view of all Cor|&s;ica, of the &s;eas and of Sardinia, with di&s;tant pro&s;|pects of Italy and France; while the Mediterranean and many of its little i&s;les are al&s;o under the eye. But people &s;eldom go to take this view; for the
<PB N="197" REF="199">
upper part of the mountain is almo&s;t a perpendicular rock, &s;o that a man mu&s;t climb two miles with the help of his hands and knees; and for the greate&s;t part of the year, this immen&s;e mountain is covered with &s;now. The&s;e two lakes of Ino and Crena, are both of con&s;iderable extent.</P>
<P>The rivers of Cor&s;ica are the Gola, a large and beautiful river, which takes its ri&s;e from the lake of Ino, traver&s;es &s;everal provinces, and after a cour&s;e of above 70 miles, empties it&s;elf into the &s;ea, ju&s;t by the ancient city of Mariana. The Tavignano, is al&s;o a con&s;iderable river, which takes its ri&s;e from the lake of Crena, and after traver&s;ing a long tract of rude country, empties it&s;elf into the &s;ea, ju&s;t by the ancient city of Aleria. The Re&s;tonica, which tho' but a &s;mall river, is famous in Cor&s;ica, on account of its particular qualities. Its water is clear as chry&s;tal, and mo&s;t agreeable to drink, &s;o that <HI>Sene|ca</HI> certainly never &s;aw the Re&s;tonica, otherwi&s;e he would not have &s;aid that Cor&s;ica had not <HI>hau&s;tus aquae,</HI> a draught of water. The Rectonica is &s;aid to be of a mineral nature, and very whole&s;ome. It hath a virtue of whitening every thing. The &s;tones in its channel are like as many pieces of chalk. It will make iron look almo&s;t like &s;ilver, and never ru&s;t. The Cor&s;icans frequently dip the barrels and locks of their guns in it.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="200">There are &s;everal other rivers of which we &s;hall not give a particular de&s;cription. There are al&s;o a great many rivulets which &s;erve to enrich the country, and keep it con&s;tantly fre&s;h.</P>
<P>It hath been &s;aid, that with proper care and ex|pence, &s;ome of the Cor&s;ican rivers might be rendered navigable; but this would be a very idle project; for their cour&s;es are exceedingly rapid, and when there has been a great deal of rain, the torrents which tumble from the mountains, often bring down large fragments of rock, which would da&s;h in pieces any ve&s;&s;els that they &s;hould encounter.</P>
<P>Thus are many mineral &s;prings, both of hot and cold kind, in different parts of the i&s;land; which the inhabitants of the country find to be very efficacious for the cure of mo&s;t di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>Cor&s;ica is extremely well &s;upplied with fi&s;h. Trout and eel are found in great plenty, very fat, and of an uncommon &s;ize. But the rich trea&s;ure of fi&s;h for Cor&s;ica, is in its &s;ea; for on all its coa&s;ts, there is the greate&s;t variety of all the be&s;t kinds, and in par|ticular, a &s;ort of ton or &s;turgeon, and the &s;mall fi&s;h called the Sardinas, which is of an exqui&s;ite ta&s;te; and in &s;everal places the Cor&s;icans have beds of oy&s;ters, remarkably large; of which they have
<PB N="199" REF="201">
not only a &s;ufficiency for their own con&s;umption, but export a great many to Italy.</P>
<P>From the earlie&s;t times, Cor&s;ica has been famous for its excellent fi&s;h. <HI>Juvenal,</HI> when &s;atyri&s;ing the exce&s;&s;ive luxury of the Romans in his time, who brought every delicacy from the greate&s;t di&s;tance, &s;ays,
<Q><HI>Mullus erit domini quem mi&s;it Cor&s;ica.</HI>
<BIBL>JUV. SAT. v. l. 92.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>'A precious mullet from the Cor&s;ick &s;eas,</L>
<L>Nor le&s;s the ma&s;ter's pamper'd ta&s;te can plea&s;e.'</L></Q></P>
<P>Cor&s;ica hath as great a variety of animals, as mo&s;t countries. The hor&s;es here, are in general of a very &s;mall breed. <HI>Procopius</HI> in his wars of the Goths, &s;ays, they run about in herds, and were little bigger than &s;heep. They are, however, remarkably lively, and very hardy; &s;omewhat of the nature of Welch ponies, or of the little hor&s;es called &s;helties, which are found in the high lands and i&s;lands of Scotland. The a&s;&s;es and mules here, are al&s;o &s;mall, but very &s;trong, and wonderfully agile in &s;crambling along the &s;teep rocky mountains, for there are hardly any made roads in the i&s;land. Had their country been open and acce&s;&s;ible, they had been ea&s;ily &s;ubdued by regular troops. It was in a good mea&s;ure owing to
<PB N="200" REF="202">
her rugged hills, that ancient Scotland pre&s;erved her independence.</P>
<P>The black cattle are larger in proportion than the hor&s;es; but the greate&s;t part of the i&s;land, is not very proper pa&s;ture for them; &s;o in general, they do not give much milk, and their beef is lean and tough. There is not &s;o great occa&s;ion for milk in Cor&s;ica, as they make no butter, oil &s;upplying its place, as in Italy, and mo&s;t warm countries. They, however, make a good deal of chee&s;e in &s;ome pieves.</P>
<P>There are here a va&s;t number of goats which brow&s;e upon the wild hills, and put one in mind of <HI>Virgil's</HI> Bucolicks, where mention is &s;o often made of this animal. Sheep are al&s;o very plentiful, and have fine feeding; &s;o that their mutton is very &s;weet and juicy, and atones for the badne&s;s of the beef.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ican &s;heep are generally black, or of a du&s;ky colour; a white &s;heep being here and there to be met with in a flock, as black ones are among&s;t our &s;heep. The wool is coar&s;e and hairy, which the people of the country impute to their &s;heep be|ing of a mongrel race. They have had thoughts of helping this, by importing a good breed from Eng|land or Spain. But it is averred by the breeders of
<PB N="201" REF="203">
&s;heep, that the quality of the wool is not &s;o much owing to the kind of &s;heep, as to the nature of their pa&s;ture; for tho&s;e &s;heep who bear very rough fleeces when upon one farm, will, when put upon another of a different &s;oil, bear fleeces exceedingly fine. It is very common here, for &s;heep to have more horns than two: many of them have &s;ix.</P>
<P>The fore&s;ts of this i&s;land abound in deer. And there is here a curious animal, called the Muffoli. It re&s;embles a &s;tag, and has horns like a ram, and a &s;kin uncommonly hard. It is very wild, and lives on the highe&s;t mountains, where it can hardly be approached, it is &s;o nimble. It will jump from rock to rock, at the di&s;tance of many feet, and if hard chaced to the extremity of a cliff, from whence it can reach no other, it will throw it&s;elf over, and with &s;urpri&s;ing agility, pitch upon its horns, with|out receiving any hurt. When the&s;e creatures are young, they are very ea&s;ily tamed.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ican animals in general, appear wild to &s;trangers. <HI>Polybius</HI> gives us a rea&s;on for it. All the animals in the i&s;land, appear to be wild; on this account, that it is &s;o rude and &s;teep, and &s;o thick with trees, that the &s;hepherds are not able to follow their flocks! The wild boar is found here in great plenty. Indeed their &s;wine, which are very numour|ous,
<PB N="202" REF="204">
have all a mixture of the wild breed, and being fed on che&s;nuts, they are agreeable food.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans are very fond of hunting the wild boar, for which there is here a race of dogs, parti|cularly excellent. They have &s;mooth hair, and are between a ma&s;tiff, and a &s;trong &s;hepherd's dog. They are large, and exceedingly fierce; but when once they have taken an attachment, they are very faithful to their ma&s;ter, watch him night and day, and are mo&s;t undaunted in his defence.</P>
<P><HI>Procopius</HI> tells us, that there were in Cor&s;ica, apes wonderfully re&s;embling men, and indeed this i&s;land, and all that quarter of Europe, before it was well inhabited, mu&s;t, on account of its vicinity to Africa, have &s;warmed with apes. Of the&s;e, however, there are at pre&s;ent no remains; which is a proof that dif|ferent &s;pecies of animals migrate from one country to another, and when their race wears out in a par|ticular part of the globe, it may be numerous &s;ome|where el&s;e. Certain it is, that in many countries, the race of &s;everal animals, well known there in an|cient times, is totally extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>There are hares enough in Cor&s;ica, but no rabbits; though <HI>Polybius,</HI> when talking of the animals of this i&s;land, &s;ays there are rabbits, and is very minute as
<PB N="203" REF="205">
to their form and qualities; &s;aying, that at a di&s;tance, they might be taken for little hares, but when caught, a great difference is perceived, both in their ap|pearance and ta&s;te. There are here no wolves, nor any of the larger wild bea&s;ts, unle&s;s foxes can be reckoned &s;o, which are here indeed extremely large and ravenous. It is &s;aid, they not only de&s;troy &s;heep, but have been known to devour even foals.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a variety of birds in Cor&s;ica; eagles, vultures, wood-pigeon, turtle, thru&s;h, black|bird, and many of the &s;maller &s;pecies; and plenty of game, as partridges, woodcocks, &s;nipes, and water fowl in the lakes. The poor thru&s;hes and blackbirds too, mu&s;t be reckoned as part of the game, for they are very numerous; and from there being a great quantity of the arbutus fruit in the i&s;land, they are exceedingly fat, and are e&s;teemed a particular delicacy. It is barbarous to de&s;troy, for the mere luxury of the table, birds which make &s;uch fine mu&s;ic; &s;urely their melody affords more enjoy|ment, than what can be had from eating them. They are, however, a very common di&s;h in the &s;outhern countries, particularly in France.</P>
<P>In general, it may be ob&s;erved, that this i&s;land is &s;o privileged by nature, that there is no poi&s;onous
<PB N="204" REF="206">
animal in it, for though there are &s;ome &s;corpions, their bite carries no venom. The creature in Cor|&s;ica, which approaches neare&s;t to a poi&s;onous animal, is a &s;pider, of an extraordinary &s;ize. Its bite will irritate, and inflame to a great degree, and the &s;wel|ling which it occa&s;ions, is very alarming to one unacquainted with it; but it &s;oon goes away, and no bad con&s;equences follow, more than from the &s;tinging of our bees. This &s;pider, has by &s;ome been mi&s;taken for the famous tarantula of the king|dom of Naples.</P>
<P>Trees grow remarkably well in Cor&s;ica. There is here almo&s;t every &s;ort of fruit trees, but it is princi|pally adorned with pines of different kinds, oaks, and che&s;nuts. All of the&s;e are to be found of a great &s;ize; &s;ome of the pines in particular, are exceeding lofty, and the che&s;nut tree grows to a prodigious big|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>There are exten&s;ive fore&s;ts in different places. That of Vico is mo&s;t remarkable. There is in Cor|&s;ica, timber &s;ufficient to maintain a very large fleet, and the timber here, is much harder than would be expected in &s;o &s;outhern a latitude, owing to the rocky &s;oil of the country, to the perpetual currents of fre&s;h air through its vallies, and to the temperature that proceeds from &s;ome of its mountains, being half
<PB N="205" REF="207">
the year in &s;now, and this is al&s;o one great cau&s;e of the &s;alubrity of the climate, in which Cor&s;ica has much the advantage of Sardinia.</P>
<P>The ilex, or ever-green oak, is very common here, and gives the country a cheerful look, even in the depth of winter. The lemon, the orange, the fig, and the almond trees, are al&s;o frequent. There are, however, few walnut trees, and the apple, pear, plum, and cherry, are not remarkably good, which is probably owing to no care being taken of them. Cor&s;ica has the pomegranate in great perfection; al&s;o the India fig and the aloe, which la&s;t is &s;aid to flower here, as well as in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ican mountains are covered with the ar|butus, or &s;trawberry tree, which gives a rich glow|ing appearance, as far as the eye can reach. Indeed the i&s;land is very like the country, which <HI>Virgil,</HI> in his third book of Georgics, de&s;cribes as the &s;eat of rural felicity,</P>
<P>The mulberry grows well here, and is not &s;o much in danger from blights and thunder &s;torms, as in Italy and the &s;outh of France; &s;o that Cor&s;ica is capable of producing abundance of &s;ilk. We mu&s;t not omit the laurel to which Cor&s;ica has &s;urely a very good claim. The box tree is a very common
<PB N="206" REF="208">
plant here. In mo&s;t countries it is dwarfi&s;h, and generally u&s;ed only for hedges; but it grows to a good &s;ize in Cor&s;ica, and may be reckoned a timber tree. <HI>Bochart</HI> has very ingeniou&s;ly &s;hewn, that the benches of the Tyrian &s;hips, which, according to the common tran&s;lation of <HI>Ezechiel,</HI> are &s;aid to have been made of ivory, brought out of the i&s;les of Chit|tim, were mo&s;t probably made of Cor&s;ican wood.</P>
<P><HI>Theophra&s;tus,</HI> in his hi&s;tory of plants, expatiates on the wonderful &s;ize of Cor&s;ican trees; to which he &s;ays, the pines of Latium were nothing to be compared. He al&s;o &s;ays the trees were immen&s;ely thick here; his expre&s;&s;ion is very &s;trong: the whole i&s;land &s;eemed crowded and &s;avage with woods. He relates a &s;trange tradition, that the Romans, who were &s;truck with the va&s;tne&s;s of the&s;e woods, built here a prodigious large &s;hip, which carried no le&s;s than 50 &s;ails, but was lo&s;t in the ocean. This author gives another te&s;timony to the goodne&s;s of the cli|mate, &s;oil, and air of the i&s;land; Cor&s;ica, therefore, &s;ays he, whether in re&s;pect of its temperate climate, or in re&s;pect of its &s;oil, or of its air, greatly excelleth other countries,</P>
<P>The different kinds of grain in Cor&s;ica, are wheat, barley, rye, and millet, all of which grow extremely well in &s;everal parts of the country. There are no
<PB N="207" REF="209">
oats here, as indeed hardly ever in any of the &s;outhern countries. They give their hor&s;es and mules bar|ley. The millet is excellent in Cor&s;ica, and when mixed with rye, makes a whole&s;ome bread, of which the pea&s;ants are very fond. Che&s;nuts may be reck|oned a &s;ort of grain in Cor&s;ica; for they an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of it. The Cor&s;icans eat them when roa&s;ted, by way of bread. They even have them ground into flour, and of that they make very good cakes.</P>
<P>There is a va&s;t quantity of honey produced in Cor|&s;ica; for the i&s;land has, from the earlie&s;t times, been remarkable for its &s;warms of bees. When it was &s;ubject to the Romans, a tribute was impo&s;ed upon it, of no le&s;s than 200,000 pounds of wax yearly. Indeed the laurel, the almond tree, and the myrtle, in the flowers of which, the bees find &s;o much &s;weet|ne&s;s, are very common here; and the hills are all co|vered with wild thyme, and other fragrant herbs. Yet its honey hath always been accounted bitter, by rea&s;on of the box-wood and yew, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>Many people think the bitterne&s;s which is in the Cor&s;ican honey, very agreeable. The rea&s;on which <HI>Pliny</HI> a&s;&s;igns for the bitterne&s;s of the honey, he al&s;o a&s;&s;igns for the excellence of the wax. Having men|tioned
<PB N="208" REF="210">
the Punic, the Pontic, and the Cretan, he &s;ays, after the&s;e, the Cor&s;ican wax, becau&s;e it is made from the box-tree, is &s;aid to have a certain medicinal virtue. They keep their bees in long wooden ca&s;es, or trunks of trees, with a covering of the back of the cork tree. When they want honey, they burn a little juniper wood, the &s;moak of which, makes the bees retire. They then take an iron in&s;trument with a &s;harp edged crook at the end of it, and bring out the greate&s;t part of the honey-comb, leaving only a little for the bees, who work the ca&s;e full again. By taking the honey in this way, they never kill a bee.</P>
<P>There are in Cor&s;ica a great many mines of lead, copper, iron, and &s;ilver. Near to San Florenzo, is a very rich &s;ilver mine, yielding about the value of five pounds &s;terling, for every hundred pounds weight of ore. The Cor&s;ican iron is remarkably good, having a toughne&s;s nearly equal to that of the prepared iron of Spain, famous over all the world. It is &s;aid, that the true Spani&s;h barrels are made of iron which has been worn and beaten for a long time in heads of nails in the &s;hoes of the mule, who travel with a flow and ince&s;&s;ant pace along the hard roads. But a very &s;mall proportion of the great quantity of Spa|ni&s;h barrels, which are &s;old in all parts of Europe, can have this advantage. The metal of the Cor&s;i|can
<PB N="209" REF="211">
barrels is little inferior to that of the generality of Spani&s;h ones, and they begin to make them very well.</P>
<P>An allu&s;ion has been drawn from the iron mines, and the name of Cor&s;ica, to the character of its in|habitants. <HI>Hieronymus de Marinis,</HI> a Genoe&s;e, who writes on the dominion and government of the re|public, &s;ays of this i&s;land, that the bowels of the earth abound in mines of iron; nature con&s;piring by a &s;ort of prejudice, to form a &s;imilarity between the name and the nature of the people; for the Cor&s;icans have hearts of iron, and are therefore prone to arms and the &s;word. There are al&s;o mines of allum and of &s;altpetre in &s;everal parts of Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P>There is here a kind of granate, extremely hard, &s;ome of it approaching in quality to the oriental gra|nate, which was &s;o famous in Rome, and of which &s;uch noble columns are remaining, &s;aid to have been brought from Egypt. There is here likewi&s;e por|phyry, and a great variety of ja&s;per. The magni|ficent chapel of the Grand Duke of Tu&s;cany, at Flo|rence, is fini&s;hed with Cor&s;ican ja&s;per, with which its in&s;ide, as we have remarked, is elegantly in|cru&s;ted, and has a mo&s;t beautiful appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="212">On the borders of the lake of Ino, they find pieces of rock chry&s;tal very clear, and with five &s;ides, as if they had been cut with a lapidary. They find &s;ome of it too in the mountains of I&s;tria. It is &s;o hard, that it &s;trikes fire, and the Cor&s;icans frequently u&s;e it for flints to their fu&s;ils.</P>
<P>Near to Ba&s;tia, there is found a &s;ort of mineral, called by the country people, <HI>petra quadrata,</HI> becau&s;e it is always found in little &s;quare bits. It has much about the hardne&s;s of marble, a colour like iron ore, and weight like lead. The Cor&s;icans a&s;cribe cer|tain my&s;tical virtues to this &s;tone, as appears from an old monki&s;h di&s;tich made in its prai&s;e:
<Q><L><HI>Petrae quadratae duro de marmore natae</HI></L>
<L><HI>Innumeras doles quis numerare pote&s;t?</HI></L></Q>
<Q><L><HI>i. e.</HI> Of the &s;quare &s;tone of marble grown,</L>
<L>The virtues fell, what man can tell!</L></Q></P>
<P>From the de&s;cription of Cor&s;ica now given, it will appear to be a country of con&s;iderable impor|tance. According to <HI>Templeman's</HI> tables, it contains 2,520 &s;quare miles.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="213">The number of inhabitants in Cor&s;ica, has not been exactly taken of late, but they may be reckoned 220,000 &s;ouls. The number, however, is much le&s;s than it was in ancient times. It is well ob&s;erved, by an able writer, that the depopulation of many countries, &s;eem to have been fir&s;t occa&s;ioned by the havock which the Romans made among the &s;maller &s;tates and cities, before they could fully e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;overeign power. In no &s;tate could this cau&s;e of depopulation take place, more than in Cor&s;ica, for in no &s;tate were the nations harder to be &s;ubdued. When to the Roman havock, we add the re|iterated tumults, which, during a cour&s;e of ages, have &s;haken this i&s;land, we need be at no lo&s;s to account why the number of its inhabitants is dimi|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The principal cities of this i&s;land are Ba&s;tia, and Corte, of which we &s;hall treat in the &s;ucceeding chapter, as al&s;o of the general characters, cu&s;toms, and manners of the inhabitants of Cor&s;ica.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Cities, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BASTIA, &s;ituated on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the i&s;land, has for a long time been reckoned the capital of Cor|&s;ica. It was here that the Genoe&s;e held the &s;eat of their &s;overeigns power; and indeed Ba&s;tia is &s;till the large&s;t town in the i&s;land. It has a &s;tately appear|ance from the &s;ea, being built on the declivity of a hill, though upon entering the town, a &s;tranger is a good deal di&s;appointed; for the hou&s;es are in general ill built, and the &s;treets narrow, and from the &s;itua|tion of the town, nece&s;&s;arily very &s;teep. There are, however, &s;everal pretty good buildings here. It hath a ca&s;tle, which commands the town and har|bour, which though but a &s;orry fortification at pre|&s;ent, is capable of being made a place of con&s;iderable &s;trength, as it hath a range of hills behind it, on which little redoubts might be erected; and with the&s;e, and a few &s;ub&s;tantial out-works towards the &s;ea, it might &s;tand a pretty long &s;iege.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="215">The church of <HI>S. John</HI> in this city, by no means an inelegant building, belongs to the Je&s;uits, who have here a college. Their garden is finely &s;ituated, large and well laid out. This they owe in a great mea&s;ure to the French, who have been &s;tationed in Cor&s;ica at different times. From them the inha|bitants have learned much of what they know of the arts and conveniencies of life. There is here a convent of Lagari&s;ts or Mi&s;&s;ionaries, a va&s;t and magnificent hou&s;e, almo&s;t overhanging the &s;ea. The convent of the Franci&s;cans, and that of the Capuchins, are &s;ituated on the ri&s;ing ground behind Ba&s;tia. The la&s;t &s;tands in a beautiful expo&s;ure, and has really a very pretty front. The number of inha|bitants in this town, are e&s;timated at 10,000.</P>
<P>From Ba&s;tia &s;outh, to beyond Aleria, is one con|tinued plain, between 50 and 60 miles in length, proper for rai&s;ing all &s;orts of grain as well as pa&s;tur|age.</P>
<P>In the centre of the i&s;land, &s;tands Corte, which is properly its capital, and will one day be a city of eminence. Here is the general's palace, and here is the &s;upreme &s;eat of ju&s;tice where the executive power con&s;tantly re&s;ides, and where the legi&s;lature is annu|ally a&s;&s;embled; and here al&s;o is the univer&s;ity,
<PB N="214" REF="216">
which in time, may become a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;eat of learning.</P>
<P>Corte is &s;ituated part at the foot, and part on the declivity of a rock, in a plain &s;urrounded with pro|digious high mountains, and at the conflux of two rivers, the Tavignano and Re&s;tonica. It has a great deal of rich country about it, and a wonderful na|tural &s;trength, being hemmed in by almo&s;t impa&s;|&s;able mountains and narrow defiles, which may be defended by a handful of men, again&s;t very large armies.</P>
<P>Upon a point of the rock prominent above the re&s;t, and on every &s;ide perpendicular, &s;tands the ca&s;tle or citadel. It is at the back of the town, and is almo&s;t impregnable, there being only one wind|ing pa&s;&s;age to climb up to it, and that not capable of admitting more than two per&s;ons abrea&s;t. In the plain on the north of Corte, is a convent of Capu|chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the &s;ide of the hill to the &s;outh of the city, there is a convent of Franci&s;cans. Here the General lived while his palace was repairing; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of re&s;pect are lodged.

<PB N="215" REF="217">
is the prettie&s;t town in Cor&s;ica. It has many very hand&s;ome &s;treets, and beautiful walks; a citadel and a palace for the Genoe&s;e governor. The inhabitants of this town, are the genteele&s;t people in the i&s;land, having had a good deal of intercour&s;e with the French.</P>
<P>Such is the only information we have been able to procure, re&s;pecting their cities. We now pro|ceed to treat of their character, cu&s;toms, and man|ners.</P>
<P>The genius and character of the inhabitants of Cor&s;ica, de&s;erve to be particularly con&s;idered, be|cau&s;e &s;ome authors in ancient times, and the Geno|e&s;e in modern times, have repre&s;ented them in the mo&s;t unfavourable light. It is, indeed, &s;trange to find two &s;uch authors as <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Diodorus,</HI> differ|ing &s;o widely, re&s;pecting the character of the peo|ple of this i&s;land, and &s;eemingly contradicting each other. <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;ays, tho&s;e who dwell on the moun|tains of Cyrnus, as it was called by the Romans, and live by robberies, are wilder than even wild bea&s;ts. Therefore when the Roman Generals make irruptions into their country, and falling upon their &s;trong holds, carry off numbers of the&s;e people, and bring them to Rome; it is wonderful to &s;ee what wildne&s;s and brutality the creatures di&s;cover: for,
<PB N="216" REF="218">
they either are impatient of life, and lay violent hands on them&s;elves; or, if they do live, it is in &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction and in&s;en&s;ibility, that tho&s;e who purcha&s;e them for &s;laves, have a very bad bargain; though they pay very little money for them, and &s;olely regret their happening to fall into their hands. <HI>Diodorus,</HI> on the other hand, &s;ays, the Cor&s;ican &s;laves &s;eem to differ from all others, in their utility for the offices of life, for which they are fitted by a peculiar gift of nature. The&s;e i&s;landers live among them&s;elves with a humanity and ju&s;tice, beyond all other barbarians. In every part of the economy of life, they &s;hew a remarkable re|gard to equity.</P>
<P><HI>M. Burnaby,</HI> who vi&s;ited this i&s;land, thinks the&s;e very different accounts may be reconciled, by &s;up|po&s;ing the authors to &s;peak of the Cor&s;icans, under different points of view; <HI>Strabo,</HI> as of enemies, <HI>Di|odorus,</HI> as of friends; and then they will not only be found reconcileable, but will exactly corre&s;pond with the character of the Cor&s;icans at pre&s;ent. In war, they are furious as lions. Death is e&s;teemed nothing; nor is any power &s;ufficient to make them yield again&s;t their inclination; they become irri|tated, and will not brook re&s;traint. But in peace and civil life, they are mild and ju&s;t to the greate&s;t degree, and have all tho&s;e amiable qualities,
<PB N="217" REF="219">
which <HI>Diodorus</HI> a&s;cribes to them. Where their &s;er|vice is voluntary, or they are attached to their ma&s;ters, by kind and gentle treatment, they have the other perfections which he allows them.</P>
<P>The following in&s;tances are related by <HI>Paoli,</HI> of the &s;pirit and patrioti&s;m of the Cor&s;icans, in their conflicts with the Genoe&s;e, for recovering their li|berties. A &s;erjeant, &s;aid he, who fell in one of our de&s;perate actions, when ju&s;t a dying, wrote to me thus: "I &s;alute you: take care of my aged father. In two hours I &s;hall be with the re&s;t who have bravely died for their country.</P>
<P>A Cor&s;ican gentleman, who had been taken pri|&s;oner by the Genoe&s;e, was thrown into a dungeon, where he was chained to the ground. While he was in this di&s;mal &s;ituation, the Genoe&s;e &s;ent a me&s;|&s;age to him, that if he would accept a commi&s;&s;ion in their &s;ervice, he might have it. 'No, &s;aid he; were I to accept your offer, it would be with a deter|mined purpo&s;e to take the fir&s;t opportunity of re|turning to the &s;ervice of my country. But I will not accept it. For I would not have my country|men &s;u&s;pect even for one moment that I could be unfaithful.' Though the affection between relations is very &s;trong in the Cor&s;icans, they will give up tho&s;e who are the neare&s;t allied to them, for the
<PB N="218" REF="220">
good of their country, and would &s;acrifice &s;uch as de|&s;erted to the Genoe&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Paoli</HI> &s;ays <HI>Bo&s;well,</HI> gave me a noble in&s;tance of a Cor&s;ican's feeling and greatne&s;s of mind. A cri|minal, &s;aid he, was condemned to die. His nephew came to me with a lady of di&s;tinction, that &s;he might &s;olicit his pardon. The nephew's anxiety, made him think that the lady did not &s;peak with &s;ufficient force and earne&s;tne&s;s. He therefore ad|vanced, and addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me; Sir, is it pro|per for me to &s;peak? as if he felt that it was unlaw|ful to make &s;uch an application. I bid him go on. Sir, &s;aid he, with the deepe&s;t concern, may I beg the life of my uncle? If it is granted, his relations will make a gift to the &s;tate of 1000 zechins. We we will furni&s;h 50 &s;oldiers in pay, during the war. We will agree that my uncle &s;hall be bani&s;hed, and engage he &s;hall never return to the i&s;land. I knew the nephew to be a man of worth, and I an&s;wered him. You are acquainted with the circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e. Such is my confidence in you, that if you will &s;ay that giving your uncle a pardon, would be ju&s;t, u&s;eful, or honourable for Cor&s;ica, I promi&s;e you it &s;hall be granted. He turned about bur&s;t into tears, and left me, &s;aying, I would not have the hnour of my country &s;old for 1000 ze|chins: and his uncle &s;uffered.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="221">The following remarkable anecdote, related by <HI>Paoli,</HI> in favour of the heroi&s;m of the Iri&s;h, de&s;erves likewi&s;e to be recorded. At the &s;iege of Tortona, the commander of the army which lay before the town, ordered <HI>Carew,</HI> an Iri&s;h officer, in the &s;ervice of Naples, to advance with a detachment to a particu|lar po&s;t. Having given his orders, he whi&s;pered to <HI>Carew:</HI> Sir, I know you to be a gallant man. I have therefore put you upon this duty. I tell you in confidence, it is certain death for you all. I place you there to make the enemy &s;pring a mine below you. <HI>Carew</HI> made a bow to the General, and led his men in &s;ilence to the dreadful po&s;t. He there &s;tood with an undaunted countenance, and having called to one of the &s;oldiers for a draught of wine, Here, &s;aid he, I drink to all tho&s;e who bravely fall in battle. Fortunately at that in&s;tant, Tortona ca|pitulated, and <HI>Carew</HI> e&s;caped. But he had thus a full opportunity of di&s;playing a rare in&s;tance of de|termined intrepidity. It is with plea&s;ure we record this anecdote, &s;o much to the honour of a gentle|man of that nation, on which illiberal reflections are too often thrown, by tho&s;e of whom it little de&s;erves them. Whatever may be the rough jokes of wealthy in&s;olence, or the envious &s;arca&s;ms of needy jealou&s;y, the Iri&s;h have ever been, and will continue to be mo&s;t highly re&s;pected on the continent.</P>

Their moun|tains abound in &s;warms of bees, and flow with milk and honey; like the genius of the Cor&s;icans, who, while they have milk and honey under their tongues, have al&s;o a &s;ting, and are therefore born for the forum. They have all a turn for the arts. Paint|ing, indeed, has not yet flouri&s;hed among them, but they &s;ucceed well in mu&s;ic and poetry. There are few of them who do not play upon the citra, an old Moori&s;h in&s;trument, which they are plea&s;ed to think the ancient cythara. It has a &s;weet and romantic &s;ound, and many of their airs are tender and beau|tiful.</P>
<P>They have not yet produced any large and fi|ni&s;hed poem; but they have many little pieces, ex|ceedingly pretty, mo&s;t of them on war, or on love. They have al&s;o many little ballads and madrigals, full of drollery and keen &s;atire again&s;t the Genoe&s;e; and they have their e&s;&s;ays of grave humour, and various allegories, re&s;pecting them&s;elves and their enemies. They have in particular, a curious para|phra&s;e of the Lord's prayer, where all the petitions are &s;trangely turned into &s;evere accu&s;ations again&s;t the Genoe&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="223">The Cor&s;icans are in general of &s;mall &s;tatue and rather hard favoured, much like the Scotch high|landers; though as we find among the&s;e, &s;o we al&s;o find among the Cor&s;icans, many of a good &s;ize and comely countenance.</P>
<P>The manners of the Cor&s;icans, have a great &s;i|milarity with tho&s;e of the ancient Germans, as de|&s;cribed by <HI>Tacitus.</HI> They have not, however, the &s;ame habit of drinking; for they are extremely temperate. Their morals are &s;trict and cha&s;te to an uncommon degree, owing in part to good prin|ciples, unhurt by luxury; and partly to the exerci&s;e of private revenge again&s;t &s;uch as violate the honour of their women.</P>
<P>What <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;ays of ancient Germany, we may &s;ay of Cor&s;ica. Nobody there laughs at vice; nor is corrupting and being corrupted, called the way of the world.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans like the Germans of old, are ex|tremely indolent, The women do the greate&s;t part of the drudgery work, as is al&s;o the cu&s;tom among the Scots highlanders. Yet they are very active in war, like the &s;ame Germans, of whom <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;ays, 'By a wonderful variety of nature, the &s;ame men are fond of indolence, and impatient of re&s;t.' Notwith|&s;tanding
<PB N="222" REF="224">
all that <HI>Paoli,</HI> their favourite General has done, the Cor&s;icans are &s;till indolent, and aver&s;e to labour. Every year 800 or 1000 Sardinians and Lucce&s;e are employed as artificers and day labour|ers in the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans love much to be round a fire. This practice &s;eems peculiar to rude nations. The Indians in North America do it, and the anci|ent Germans did it. The Scythians too had this cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>There have been many &s;trange cu&s;toms in Cor&s;ica. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> us, that after the women were brought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, the man immediately took care of the chil|dren, laying them&s;elves down as if they were &s;ick, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ndling the infants, &s;o that the mothers had no f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her trouble, than to give them &s;uck.

<P><HI>Petrus Cyrnecus</HI> &s;ays, that in his time, marriage was &s;o much honoured among the Cor&s;icans, that if any young woman was &s;o poor, that nobody a&s;ked

<P>There are &s;ome very extraordinary cu&s;toms which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Cor&s;ica. In particular, they have &s;e|veral &s;trange ceremonies at the death of their re|lations. When a man dies, e&s;pecially if he has been a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, his widow, with all the married women in the village, accompany the corp&s;e to the grave, where, after various howlings, and other expre&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow, the women fall upon the widow, and beat and tear her in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable manner. Hav|ing thus &s;atisfied their grief and pa&s;&s;ion, they lead her back again, covered with blood and brui&s;es, to her own habitation.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ican pea&s;ants and &s;oldiers are very fond of baiting cattle with the large mountain dogs. This keeps up a ferocity among them, which totally extingui&s;hes fear. I have &s;een a Cor&s;ican, &s;ays <HI>Bo&s;well,</HI> in the very heat of a baiting, run in, drive off the dogs, &s;eize the half frantic animal by the horns, and lead it away. The common people did not &s;eem much given to diver&s;ions. I ob&s;erved &s;ome of them in the great hall of the hou&s;e of Colon|na, where I was lodged, amu&s;ing them&s;elves with
<PB N="224" REF="226">
playing at a &s;ort of draughts, in a very curious man|ner. They drew upon the floor with chalk, a &s;uf|ficient number of &s;quares, chalking one all over, and leaving one open alternately; and in&s;tead of black men and white, they had bits of &s;tone, and bits of wood. It was an admirable burle&s;que on gam|ing.</P>
<P>The chief &s;atisfaction of the&s;e i&s;landers, when not engaged in war or hunting, &s;eemed to be that of lying at their ea&s;e in the open air, recounting tales of the bravery of their countrymen, and &s;inging &s;ongs in honour of the Cor&s;icans, and again&s;t the Genoe&s;e. Even in the night, they would continue this pa&s;time in the open air, unle&s;s rain forced them to retire into their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that no Cor&s;ican would, upon any account, con&s;ent to be a hangman. Not the greate&s;t criminals, who might have had their lives upon this condition. Even a wretch, who, for a paltry hire, had &s;trangled a woman, would rather &s;ubmit to death, than do the &s;ame action as the exe|cutioner of the law.</P>
<P>The hangman of Cor&s;ica, &s;ays <HI>Bo&s;well,</HI> was a great curio&s;ity. I went up and looked at him, dur|ing my re&s;idence at Corte; and a more dirty, rueful
<PB N="225" REF="227">
&s;pectacle, I never beheld. Being held in the ut|mo&s;t dete&s;tation, he dur&s;t not live like another inha|bitant of the i&s;land. He was obliged to take refuge in the ca&s;tle, and there he was kept in a little corner turret, where he had ju&s;t room for a mi&s;er|able bed, and a little bit of fire to dre&s;s &s;uch vic|tuals for him&s;elf, as was &s;ufficient to keep him alive; for nobody would have any intercour&s;e with him, but all turned their backs upon him. He &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of his &s;ituation, and held down his head like an abhorred outca&s;t.</P>
<P>It was a long time before they could get a hang|man in Cor&s;ica, &s;o that the puni&s;hment of the gal|lows was hardly known, all their criminals being &s;hot. At la&s;t, this creature whom I &s;aw, who was a Sicilian, came with a me&s;&s;age to <HI>Paoli.</HI> The Ge|neral, who has a wonderful talent for phy&s;iognomy, on &s;eeing the man, &s;aid immediately to &s;ome of his people about him, <HI>Ecco il boia,</HI> behold our hang|man. He gave orders to a&s;k the man if he would accept the office, and his an&s;wer was, My grandfa|ther was a hangman, my father was a hangman; I have been a hangman my&s;elf, and am willing to con|tinue &s;o. He was, therefore, immediately put into office, and the ignominious death di&s;pen&s;ed by his hands, hath had more effect, than 20 executions by fire arms.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="228">The following entertaining anecdote, related by <HI>Bo&s;well,</HI> in his tour through the i&s;land to vi&s;it the famous General <HI>Paoli,</HI> will tend further to &s;hew the great &s;implicity of ancient manners in this people.</P>
<P>When I had &s;een every thing about Corte, &s;ays this writer, I prepared for my journey to the moun|tains, that I might be with <HI>Paoli.</HI> The night be|fore I &s;et our, I recollected that I had forgotten to get a pa&s;&s;port, which I found to be a nece&s;&s;ary pre|caution. After &s;upper, therefore, the Prior with whom I had taken up my quarters, walked with me to Corte, to the hou&s;e of the great Chancellor, who ordered the pa&s;&s;port to be made out immediately; and while his &s;ecretary was writing it, entertained me by reading &s;ome of the minutes of the general con&s;ulta. When the pa&s;&s;port was fini&s;hed, and ready to have the &s;eal put to it, I was much plea&s;ed with a beautiful, &s;imple incident. The Chancellor de&s;ired a little boy who was playing in the room by us, to run to his mother, and bring the great &s;eal of the kingdom. I thought my&s;elf &s;itting in the hou&s;e of a <HI>Cincinnatus.</HI></P>
<P>Next morning, I &s;et out in very good order, hav|ing excellent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and clever Cor&s;ican guides. The worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the convent, who treated me

in the kinde&s;t manner whil&s;t I was their gue&s;t, would al&s;o give me &s;ome provi&s;ions for my journey; &s;o they put up a gourd of their be&s;t wine, and &s;ome delicious pomegranates. My Cor&s;ican guides appeared &s;o hearty, that I often got down and walked along with them, doing ju&s;t as I &s;aw them do. When we grew hungry, we threw &s;tones among the thick branches of the che&s;nut trees, which over&s;hadowed us, and in that manner we brought down a &s;hower of che&s;nuts, with which we filled our pockets, and went on eating them with great reli&s;h; and when this made us thir&s;ty, we lay down by the &s;ide of the fir&s;t brook, put our mouths to the &s;tream, and drank &s;ufficiently. It was ju&s;t like being, for a little while, one of the <HI>pri&s;ca gens mortalium;</HI> the primitive race of men, who run about in the woods, eating acorns, and drinking water.</P>
<P>While I &s;topped to refre&s;h my mules at a little village, the inhabitants came crowding about me, as an Amba&s;&s;ador going to their General. When they were informed of my country, a &s;trong black fellow &s;aid, "Engli&s;h! They are barbarians; they don't believe in the great God?" I replied, "Excu&s;e me, Sir, We do believe in God, and in Je&s;us Chri&s;t too." "Um, &s;aid he, and in the Pope?" "No." "And why?" This was a puzzling que&s;tion

in the&s;e circum&s;tances; for there was a great au|dience to the controver&s;y. I thought I would try a method of my own, and very gravely replied, becau&s;e we are too far off.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Trade, Commerce, and Manufactures.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;een how rich Cor&s;ica is in natural productions; &s;o that there is no que&s;tion, but this i&s;land might carry on a pretty exten&s;ive commerce
<PB N="229" REF="231">
in oil, wine, honey, bees-wax, &s;alt, che&s;nuts, &s;ilk, ro&s;in, box-wood, oak, pine, porphyry, marble of various kinds, lead, iron, copper, &s;ilver, and coral. At pre&s;ent, commerce is but beginning to flouri&s;h among them. They find in their &s;eas, con&s;iderable quantities of coral, of all the three kinds, red, white, and black. The Jews of Leghorn, who have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed there a coral manufactory, have a &s;ort of ex|clu&s;ive privilege from the Cor&s;icans for this trade; and in return, are very &s;erviceable to the nation, by advancing them money, and &s;upplying them with cannon.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans may make plenty of admirable wines, for their grapes are excellent. In &s;ome vil|lages, they make a rich &s;weet wine, much re&s;emb|ling tokay. In others, they make wine very much like Burgundy; and over the whole i&s;land, there are wines of different &s;orts. It is indeed, wonder|ful, what a difference a little variation of &s;oil or ex|po&s;ure will make in the ta&s;te of wine. The juice of Cor&s;ican grapes is &s;o generous, that although un&s;kil|fully manufactured, it will always plea&s;e by its na|tural flavour. The Cor&s;icans have been &s;o harra&s;&s;ed for a number of years, that they have had no lei|&s;ure to improve them&s;elves in any art or manufac|ture. It is a&s;&s;erted, however, that the exportation of oil has amounted in one year, to two millions and
<PB N="230" REF="232">
a half of livres, and that of che&s;nuts to 25,000 pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>Agriculture is as yet in a very imperfect &s;tate in Cor&s;ica. Their in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry are ill made; and they do not make the be&s;t u&s;e of what they have. Their ploughing is but &s;cratching the &s;urface of the earth, and they hardly know any thing of the advantages of manure, though they can be at no lo&s;s for &s;ufficient quantities of it.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme council appoints two or more per|&s;ons in each province, to &s;uperintend the cultivation of lands, and to take the mo&s;t effectual methods for promoting it; and in particular, to encourage the planting of mulberry trees, it being certain, that Cor&s;ica may be made to produce a great deal of &s;ilk. As gardening has been almo&s;t totally neglected, there is a late ordinance, by which every man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a garden, or other inclo&s;ure, is obliged to &s;ow every year, pea&s;e, beans, and all &s;orts of gar|den &s;tuff, and not le&s;s than a pound of each, under the penalty of four livres, to be exacted by the Po|de&s;tas.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme council al&s;o appoints two con&s;uls, to in&s;pect the kind and the price of the various &s;orts of the merchandi&s;e in the i&s;land; and to watch
<PB N="231" REF="233">
over every thing that can tend towards the advance|ment of commerce.</P>
<P>Provi&s;ions are not dear in Cor&s;ica. Their prices on a medium, are as follows: A labouring ox, about 80 livres. A cow, from 20 to 30 livres. A hor&s;e of the be&s;t quality, from 100 to 140 livres. A &s;heep, about four livres. A partridge, 4 &s;ous. Beef, two &s;ous a pound. Mutton, two thirds of a &s;ou a pound. Fi&s;h, from one to two &s;ous a pound. Wine, four &s;ous a fla&s;k, of 6 lb. weight.</P>
<P>Oil is &s;old in barrels, valued from 40 to 50 livres. A barrel contains 20 pints. A pint contains four quarts. Wine is &s;old in barrels of 12 zuchas. The zucha contains nine large Florence ca&s;ks. Grain is &s;old by the bu&s;hel. The bu&s;hel contains 12 bacine. The bacino weighs about 20 pounds. The &s;ack or bu&s;hel &s;ells at 18 livres.</P>
<P>The wages of a trade&s;man, or of a day labourer, are a livre a day, and victuals and drink. If a trade&s;|man is particularly ingenious in his profe&s;&s;ion, he has &s;omething more. Reapers have no wages in money; but be&s;ides their victuals, each gets a baci|no of the grain which he cuts down.</P>
<P>The manufactures of Cor&s;ica, are as yet very rude.
<PB N="232" REF="234">
Their wool is exceedingly coar&s;e, and generally black; of this they make a thick, heavy cloth. The pure black is the mo&s;t valuable; when a little white is mixed with it, the cloth is not &s;o much e&s;|teemed, being of a ru&s;&s;et grey, or brown du&s;ky co|lour. They import all their fine cloth; for be&s;ides that, there is not a &s;ufficient quantity of wool for the &s;ervice of the i&s;land, the Cor&s;icans have not learned to make any thing el&s;e of it, but the coar&s;e cloth above-mentioned.</P>
<P>A good deal of flax grows in Cor&s;ica, and no doubt a good deal of it might be rai&s;ed. But in reality, the Cor&s;icans areas yet &s;o backward, that they hardly make any linen at all, which occa&s;ions a very heavy importation.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans have plenty of oil for their lamps, which is the light they generally u&s;e. They al&s;o make wax candles, and a few tallow ones; their cat|tle not yielding much fat.</P>
<P>There is plenty of leather in the i&s;land. Many of the pea&s;ants ju&s;t harden the hides in the air, particu|larly the wild boar &s;kins, and have their &s;hoes made of them, without being tanned. This they are under no temptation of doing, but that of poverty and la|zine&s;s; for the art of tanning is very well under&s;tood
<PB N="233" REF="235">
in Cor&s;ica, and the materials for it are in &s;uch abundance, that a great deal of bark is carried over into Italy. The Cor&s;icans have a method of tan|ning with the leaves of wild laurel, dried in the &s;un, and beaten into a powder. This gives a &s;ort of a greeni&s;h colour to the leather.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Ancient Hi&s;tory and Government; together with Anec|dotes relative to the Hi&s;tory of the I&s;land; of the famous King Theodore, and of Paoli.</HEAD>
<P>THE earlie&s;t accounts we have of Cor&s;ica, are to be found in <HI>Herodotus.</HI> He tells us that its fir&s;t in|habitants were Phenicians; and that eight genera|tions after <HI>Theras</HI> brought a colony to the i&s;land from Lacedemon. His account of the fir&s;t peopling of Cor&s;ica, is a very curious piece of ancient hi&s;tory. It afterwards got the name of Cyrnus, from the number of its promontories; and <HI>I&s;iodorus</HI> relates the manner in which it got the name of Cor&s;ica. According to him, <HI>Cor&s;a,</HI> a Ligurian woman, hav|ing often ob&s;erved a bull &s;wim over to the i&s;land, and return much fatter, &s;he had the curio&s;ity to follow him in a little ve&s;&s;el, and &s;o di&s;covered the i&s;land with all its beauty and fertility. Upon which the Ligurians &s;ent thither a colony; and from <HI>Cor&s;a,</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="236">
who had made the di&s;covery, they called the i&s;land Cor&s;ica. This is ludicrous enough; but we may trace what has given ri&s;e to &s;o extraordinary a fiction, when we con&s;ider, that very probably a people from the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Italy, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cor|&s;ica.</P>
<P>Its next ma&s;ters were the Carthiginians. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> relates a mo&s;t extraordinary piece of Punic policy, with re&s;pect to Cor&s;ica. Finding it was difficult to keep the inhabitants in &s;ubjection, they ordered the whole of the vines and olives in the i&s;land to be pulled up, and forbad the Cor&s;icans, under pain of death, to &s;ow their fields with any kind of grain, that they might be kept in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute de|pendence. So early was the cowardly and barba|rous policy of a trading republic exerci&s;ed again&s;t this people.</P>
<P>Cor&s;ica next pa&s;&s;ed under the dominion of Rome. It appears, however, that the Cor&s;icans could not bear &s;ubjection with patience, for they were conti|nually attempting to get free. Under the Romans, it was made to &s;erve for a place of exile. On the ir|ruption of the barbarous nations, Cor&s;ica &s;hared the &s;ame &s;ate with the other dominions of the ruined empire. It fell a prey to the Goths, who e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="235" REF="237">
there the feudal &s;y&s;tem, as they did in every other country, to which their arms penetrated.</P>
<P>From this period, the hi&s;tory of Cor&s;ica is for many ages a continued &s;eries of wars, ravage, and de&s;truction, by a variety of contending powers. About the beginning of the 14th century, the Cor&s;i|cans were, for the fir&s;t time, brought under the power of the Genoe&s;e; with whom they have &s;ince had &s;uch &s;truggles for that freedom, which they ap|pear to have at all times attempted to recover.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e were the wor&s;t nation to whom Cor|&s;ica could have fallen. The Cor&s;icans were a peo|ple, impetuous, violent, and brave; who had wea|thered many a &s;torm, and who could not have been governed, but by a &s;tate of which they &s;tood &s;ome|what in awe, and which, by humanity and proper encouragement, might have conciliated their affec|tion. Whereas, the Genoe&s;e were a nation of re|publicans, and it has been always remarked, that the foreign &s;ubjects of a little republic, are much wor&s;e u&s;ed, than tho&s;e of a great kingdom. Accord|ingly, the Genoe&s;e did not treat the Cor&s;icans with that gentlene&s;s and confidence, which alone could have &s;ecured their attachment and obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="238">They even took a direct contrary cour&s;e; and al|though they did not u&s;e &s;uch de&s;perate means as the Carthiginians, their oppre&s;&s;ion was heavy; their &s;y&s;tem was not to render the Cor&s;icans happier and better, but by keeping them in ignorance and op|pre&s;&s;ed, to prevent their endeavouring to get free.</P>
<P>In this unhappy &s;ituation was Cor&s;ica. Often did the natives ri&s;e in arms; but having no leader to direct them, they was immediately quelled. So apprehen&s;ive were the Genoe&s;e, that they burnt 120 of the be&s;t villages in Cor&s;ica, while 4,000 people left the i&s;land. What &s;hewed the Genoe&s;e policy in the wor&s;t light, was, that many of the&s;e i&s;land|ers who had gone over to the continent, made a di&s;|tingui&s;hed figure in mo&s;t of the European &s;tates, both in learning and in arms.</P>
<P>About the year 1550, Cor&s;ica revived under the conduct of a great hero, who aro&s;e for the deliver|ance of his country. This was <HI>Sampiero di Ba&s;telica.</HI> He was, however, &s;topped in his career by the treachery of the Genoe&s;e, who had him ba&s;ely a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated in the year 1567.</P>
<P>Long de&s;pi&s;ed, plundered, and oppre&s;&s;ed, the Cor&s;icans again revived in 1729, when the war com|menced, which, with &s;ome intervals, continued,
<PB N="237" REF="239">
till they had finally re&s;cued them&s;elves from the &s;la|very of their inveterate ma&s;ters, the Genoe&s;e.</P>
<P>It is wonderful to &s;ee, how great wants are pro|duced by little cau&s;es. The ri&s;e of the Cor&s;icans, in 1729, was occa&s;ioned by a &s;ingle paolo, a piece worth about five-pence Engli&s;h. A Genoe&s;e col|lector, went to the hou&s;e of a poor old woman, and demanded this trifling &s;um, as the money for which &s;he was a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Being in extreme penury, &s;he had not wherewithal to &s;atisfy the demand. Upon which, the collector began to abu&s;e her, and to &s;eize &s;ome of her furniture. She begged him to have patience, and &s;aid, &s;he hoped in a few days, to be be able to pay him. He per&s;i&s;ted in his &s;everity, and the poor woman made a great lamentation. Two or three people hearing the noi&s;e, entered the hou&s;e, took the part of the woman, and exclaimed again&s;t the barbarity of the collector. He threat|ened them with puni&s;hment, for having hindered him in the execution of his office. This provoked the villagers, and they drove him away with &s;tones. The Genoe&s;e &s;ent troops to &s;upport their collector, and the Cor&s;icans a&s;&s;embled in large bodies to de|fend them&s;elves. The tumult encrea&s;ed. A &s;park was &s;ufficient to kindle the flame in a people who &s;o often glowed with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of liberty, and
<PB N="238" REF="240">
in a very &s;hort time, the whole i&s;land was in mo|tion.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans immediately ru&s;hed upon the ca|pital, which they took almo&s;t without re&s;i&s;tance; and they would have been matters of the ca&s;tle, had they been a little better regulated.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e at fir&s;t endeavoured to overawe the Cor&s;icans, by the &s;ole force of the republic; but find|ing them&s;elves unable, they applied to the Em|peror, <HI>Charles</HI> VI. who &s;ent a &s;trong army of Ger|mans there, with the Prince of <HI>Wertemberg</HI> at their head. The Cor&s;icans were not in a condition to re|&s;i&s;t &s;uch a force. They laid down their arms, upon condition that a treaty &s;hould be made between them and the Genoe&s;e, having the Emperor for gua|rantee.</P>
<P>This treaty having been broken by the latter, there was a very &s;hort &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities; and in 1734, the Cor&s;icans ro&s;e anew.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e had paid very dear for their victory in their &s;truggles. It was computed, that it had co&s;t them above 30,000,000 of livres, be&s;ides co&s;tly pre&s;ents to the Prince of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> and to the other general officers.</P>

<P><PB N="239" REF="242">The Marquis <HI>d'Argens,</HI> very plea&s;antly applies to the Genoe&s;e, the French Fable of a Gardener, who complained to a gentleman in the neighbourhood, that a hare came every day into his garden, and eat his cabbages; and begged the gentleman would be &s;o good to drive her out for him. The gentleman comes with a pack of hounds, and half a dozen hunt&s;men, and does more mi&s;chief in five minutes, than the hare could have done in &s;even years. After a prodigious chace, the hare made her e&s;cape through a hole in the wall. Upon which, the Gen|tleman congratulated the gardener on getting rid of his enemy, and advi&s;ed him to &s;top up the hole. So the Genoe&s;e, after having expended a great deal more upon foreign auxiliaries, than they could ever derive from Cor&s;ica, had the mortification, on the departure of the&s;e auxiliaries, to find them&s;elves ju&s;t as they were.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Genoe&s;e and the Cor&s;icans were keenly engaged again, and the politicians of Europe forming various conjectures, a mo&s;t extraordinary circum&s;tance occurred, to the amazement of every one. This was the appearance of the famous King <HI>Theodore,</HI> who&s;e &s;ingular hi&s;tory made &s;o much noi&s;e. As many incon&s;i&s;tent reports were circulated, with regard to this man, who now lies in this country,
<PB N="240" REF="243">
the following authentic accounts concerning him, will perhaps not be unacceptable to our readers.</P>
<P><HI>Theodore Baron Newhoff,</HI> in the county of La Marc, in We&s;tphalia, was the per&s;onage who a&s;pired to the &s;overeignty of Cor&s;ica. He had his education in the French &s;ervice. He afterwards went to Spain. But being of a &s;trange, un&s;ettled, project|ing di&s;po&s;ition, he quitted Spain, and went and tra|velled into Italy, England, and Holland, always in &s;earch of &s;ome new adventure. He at la&s;t fixed his attention on Cor&s;ica, and formed a &s;cheme of mak|ing him&s;elf king.</P>
<P>He was a man of abilities and addre&s;s; and after having fully informed him&s;elf of every thing re|lating to the i&s;land, he went to Tunis, where he fell upon means to procure &s;ome money and arms; and then came to Leghorn, from whence he wrote a letter to the Cor&s;ican chiefs, offering con&s;iderable advantage to the nation, if they would elect him as their &s;overeign. This letter was con&s;igned to the Cor&s;ican plenipotentiary in Tu&s;cany; and he gave for an&s;wer, that if <HI>Theodore</HI> brought the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he promi&s;ed to the Cor&s;icans, they would very wil|lingly make him king.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="244">Upon this, without lo&s;s of time, he &s;et &s;ail, and landed in Cor&s;ica in &s;pring, 1736. He was a man of very &s;tately appearance, and the Turki&s;h dre&s;s he wore, added to the dignity of his mien. He had a few attendants with him. His manners were &s;o engaging, and his offers &s;o plau&s;ible, that he was proclaimed King of Cor&s;ica, before the Amba&s;&s;a|dors di&s;patches arrived to inform the chiefs of the terms upon which he had agreed. He brought with him about 1000 zechins, be&s;ides &s;ome arms and am|munition, and made magnificent promi&s;es of foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Theodore</HI> a&s;&s;umed every mark of royal dignity. He had his guards, and his officers of &s;tate. He conferred titles of honour, and he &s;truck money, both of &s;ilver and copper. The &s;ilver pieces were few in number, and can hardly now be met with. It was &s;uch a curio&s;ity over all Europe, to have King <HI>Theodore's</HI> coins, that the &s;ilver pieces were &s;old at four zechins each; and when the genuine ones were exhau&s;ted, imitations of them were made at Naples, and like the imitations of antiques, were bought up at a high price, and carefully pre&s;ervedin the cabinets of the virtuo&s;i.</P>
<P><HI>Theodore</HI> immediately blocked up the Genoe&s;e fortified towns; and he u&s;ed to be &s;ometimes at
<PB N="242" REF="245">
one &s;iege, and &s;ometimes at another, &s;tanding with a tele&s;cope in his hand, as if he &s;pied the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he &s;aid he expected. He u&s;ed al&s;o the ar|tifice of making large packets be continually brought to him from the continent, which he gave out to be from the different &s;overeigns of Europe, acknowledg|ing his authority, and promi&s;ing to befriend him.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e were not a little confounded with this unexpected adventure. They publi&s;hed a vio|lent manife&s;to again&s;t <HI>Theodore,</HI> treating him with great contempt, but at the &s;ame time &s;hewing, they were alarmed at his appearance. <HI>Theodore</HI> replied in a manife&s;to, with all the calmne&s;s and dignity of a monarch; expre&s;&s;ed his indifference as to the in|jurious treatment of the republic, and appeared firm in the hopes of victory.</P>
<P>After having been about eight months in Cor&s;ica, <HI>Theodore</HI> perceived that the people began to cool in their affections towards him, and did not act with the &s;ame re&s;olution as before. He therefore wi&s;ely determined to leave them for a little, and try his fortune again upon the continent. He accordingly, after laying down a plan of admini&s;tration to be ob|&s;erved in his ab&s;ence, went to Holland, and there he was &s;ucce&s;sful enough to get credit to a great ex|tent, from &s;everal rich merchants, particularly jews,
<PB N="243" REF="246">
who tru&s;ted him with cannon and other warlike &s;tores, to a great value, under the charge of a &s;u|percargo. With the&s;e he returned to Cor&s;ica, in 1739; and on his arrival, put to death his &s;uper|cargo, that he might not have any trouble from de|mands being made upon him.</P>
<P>By this time, the French had become &s;o powerful in the i&s;land, that although <HI>Theodore</HI> threw in his &s;upply of warlike &s;tores, he did not incline to ven|ture his per&s;on, the Genoe&s;e having &s;et a high price upon his head. He therefore cho&s;e to relinqui&s;h his throne, and give up his views of ambition, for &s;afety, having furni&s;hed a remarkable example how far a daring and de&s;perate &s;pirit may go. Had he had a little more prudence, and better fortune, <HI>Theodore</HI> and his po&s;terity, might have worn the crown of Cor&s;ica, upon the generous title of having delivered the i&s;land from oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It has been often &s;aid, that he was &s;ecretly &s;up|ported by &s;ome of the European powers. But it does not appear, there was any foundation for the con|jecture. It is, indeed, &s;omething &s;ingular, to find a private gentleman, embarking in his own bottom, in an enterprize of &s;uch a nature. But the truth is, <HI>Theodore</HI> was a mo&s;t &s;ingular man, and had been &s;o beaten about by change of fortune, that he had lo&s;t
<PB N="244" REF="247">
the common &s;entiments of mankind, and viewed things as one who is mad, or drunk, or in a high fe|ver. He had nothing to lo&s;e, and a great deal to win. His &s;cheme was to amu&s;e the Cor&s;icans with the hopes of foreign aid; and by the force of hope, to carry them forward. This might have &s;ucceeded, in which ca&s;e, he could very ea&s;ily have &s;aid, that the foreign aid would have come, had there been oc|ca&s;ion for it; but they had behaved with &s;uch &s;pi|rit, as to require no help. And had he been for|tunate, it is probable, &s;ome of the European powers might have in reality &s;tood by him.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans, who had mo&s;t faith in his fine &s;peeches, &s;till extol him to the &s;kies; others, who looked upon him as an impo&s;ter, and never joined heartily in his mea&s;ures, repre&s;ent him as a kind of <HI>Wat Tyler,</HI> king of a rabble; but the mo&s;t knowing and judicious, con&s;ider him in the moderate light in which he has been now repre&s;ented, and own he was of great &s;ervice in reviving the &s;pirit of the na|tion; which, after a good many years of con&s;tant war, was beginning to droop.</P>
<P>They indeed are &s;en&s;ible, that his wretched fate has thrown a &s;ort of ridicule on the nation, &s;ince their king was confined in a goal at London, which was actually the ca&s;e with poor <HI>Theodore;</HI> who,
<PB N="245" REF="248">
who, after experiencing the mo&s;t extraordinary vi|ci&s;&s;itudes of fortune, cho&s;e to end his days in our i&s;land of liberty; but was reduced to the wretched &s;tate of a pri&s;oner for debt.</P>
<P><HI>Horace Walpole,</HI> the pre&s;ent Earl of Orford, ge|nerou&s;ly exerted him&s;elf for <HI>Theodore.</HI> He wrote a paper in the world, with great elegance and humour, &s;oliciting a contribution for the monarch in di&s;tre&s;s, to be paid to Mr. <HI>Robert Dod&s;ley,</HI> book&s;eller, as Lord High Trea&s;urer. This brought him a very hand|&s;ome &s;um. He was allowed to get out of pri&s;on. The Earl of Orford has the original deed, by which <HI>Theodore</HI> made over the kingdom of Cor&s;ica, in &s;e|curity to his creditors. He has al&s;o the great &s;eal of the kingdom. He died very &s;oon after he got out of pri&s;on, and was buried in St. Anne's church-yard, We&s;tmin&s;ter; where a &s;imple, unadorned monu|ment is erected to him, with the following in&s;crip|tion: <HI>"Near this place is interred Theodore, King of Cor&s;ica, who died in this pari&s;h, December</HI> 11, 1756, <HI>immediately after leaving the King's Bench pri&s;on, by the benefit of the act of in&s;olvency; in con&s;equence of which, he regi&s;tered his kingdom of Cor&s;ica, for the u&s;e of his creditors.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Death to one common level all things brings,</L>
<L>Heroes, and beggars, galley-&s;laves, and kings,</L>
<L><PB N="246" REF="249">But <HI>Theodore</HI> this le&s;&s;on learnt ere dead,</L>
<L>Fate poured its le&s;&s;ons o'er his living head,</L>
<L>Be&s;towed a kingdom, but denied him bread.</L></Q>
<P>We have &s;een that <HI>Theodore</HI> dur&s;t not land. The &s;uccours he left were not of much avail. Such un|precedented and terrible &s;laughter as now took place, with the dread of &s;till greater vengeance, from &s;o formidable a nation as France, obliged the Cor&s;icans to lay down their arms. In this manner was Cor&s;i|ca totally vanqui&s;hed by France, of which the Ge|noe&s;e were as proud, as if it had been their own atchievement.</P>
<P>France being engaged with more important ob|jects than Cor&s;ica, thought proper to recal her troops from that i&s;land. The French knew the Cor&s;icans too well, to believe that they would &s;ubmit to Ge|noa, when left to them&s;elves. The event happened accordingly, for the French were hardly gone, be|fore the Cor&s;icans were again as much in motion as ever. From having been long depre&s;&s;ed, like a bow recovering its ela&s;ticity, they ro&s;e with renewed vigour. Man, woman, and child, may be &s;aid to have engaged; for very young boys took the field; and even &s;ome of the women, like tho&s;e of Sparta, &s;hewed their valour in battle.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="250"><HI>Gaffori</HI> and <HI>Matra</HI> now obtained the government of the i&s;land, under the title of Protectors of the Kingdoms. <HI>Gaffori</HI> was a man of di&s;tingui&s;hed ta|lents. His eloquence was mo&s;t remarkable. He heard once, that a band of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins was coming again&s;t him. He went out and met them with a &s;e|rene dignity which a&s;toni&s;hed them. He begged they would only hear him a little; and he gave them &s;o pathetic a picture of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Cor&s;ica, and rou&s;ed their &s;pirits to &s;uch a degree again&s;t tho&s;e who cau&s;ed the oppre&s;&s;ion, that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins threw them|&s;elves at his feet, intreated his forgivene&s;s, and in|&s;tantly joined his banners.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the celebrated <HI>Pa&s;chal Paoli</HI> was elected general of the kingdom. He was the &s;on of one of their old chiefs. He had been educated with great care by his father, who formed his ta&s;te for letters, and in&s;pired him with every worthy and noble &s;entiment. He was born in Cor&s;ica, but taken by his father to Naples, during the troubles, where he got a commi&s;&s;ion in that &s;ervice, and was much about court.</P>
<P>Here he lived 12 or 13 years, cultivating the great powers with which nature had endowed him, and laying the foundation of tho&s;e grand de&s;igns, which he had early formed for the deliverance of his coun|try.
<PB N="248" REF="251">
His reputation became &s;o great among the Cor&s;icans, that he received the &s;tronge&s;t invitations to come over and take the command. He embarked in the glorious enterprize, &s;timulated by generous ambition, and undi&s;mayed by a con&s;ideration of the dangers, cares and uncertainty he was about to en|counter.</P>
<P><HI>Paoli</HI> no &s;ooner appeared on the i&s;land, than he attracted the attention of every body. His carriage and deportment prejudiced them in his favour, and his &s;uperior judgment and patrioti&s;m, di&s;played with all the force of eloquence, charmed their un|der&s;tandings.</P>
<P>All ranks now exerted them&s;elves, in providing what was nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the war with &s;pirit; whereby, in a &s;hort time, the Genoe&s;e were driven to the remote&s;t corners of the i&s;land. <HI>Paoli</HI> had well nigh fini&s;hed his great &s;cheme of freeing every part of the i&s;land from the Genoe&s;e, when a treaty was concluded between France and the repub|lic, by which the former engaged to &s;end &s;ix battal|lions of troops, to garri&s;on the fortified towns in Cor&s;ica, for the &s;pace of four years.</P>
<P>When this treaty was fir&s;t known in Europe, every noble heart was afflicted; for every one be|lieved,
<PB N="249" REF="252">
that France was determined to carry fire and &s;word into Cor&s;ica, and bla&s;t the hopes of the brave i&s;landers. But it turned out to be a prudent and po|litic &s;cheme on the part of France. She owed the Genoe&s;e &s;ome millions of livres. Her finances were not &s;uch as made it very convenient for her to pay. The French mini&s;ters, who were never at a lo&s;s to conclude an advantageous treaty for their monarch, told the Genoe&s;e, 'We cannot yet let you have your money. But we will &s;end you &s;ix battallions of aux|iliaries to Cor&s;ica, and let that be a &s;inking fund for the di&s;charge of our debt.' The Genoe&s;e, who recalled with barbarous &s;atisfaction, what France had formerly done again&s;t the Cor&s;icans, were ex|tremely plea&s;ed with the &s;cheme.</P>
<P>The French, however, took care to engage to act only on the defen&s;ive, and to fix the treaty for four years, that they might be &s;ure of having time to &s;ink their debt. The French general was an officer of temper and experience; and no doubt, had his in|&s;tructions to conduct him&s;elf mildly towards the Cor&s;icans. All his duty was to take care that things &s;hould not become wor&s;e for Genoa, but that &s;he &s;hould &s;till retain the garri&s;on towns on the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans conducted them&s;elves on this oc|ca&s;ion, with the greate&s;t propriety. A general
<PB N="250" REF="253">
council was held, and determinations publi&s;hed, from which it appears, that they &s;hewed no di&s;tru&s;t of the French, who, they tru&s;ted, would not begin ho&s;|tilities again&s;t them. The warlike operations of Cor&s;ica, were now &s;u&s;pended; and in a &s;hort time after, all right and title to the &s;overeignty of the i&s;land was ceded by the Genoe&s;e to the French, un|der who&s;e protection, the Cor&s;icans were; but in the troubles of France, it was taken by the Engli&s;h, and the Cor&s;ican people made a formal &s;urrender of the i&s;land to the King of England.</P>
<P>The government of Cor&s;ica exhibits a compleat and well ordered democracy, from the lowe&s;t ma|gi&s;trate, up to the &s;upreme council.</P>
<P>Every village elects by majority of votes, a Pode&s;|ta, and other two magi&s;trates, who have the re&s;pect|able name of Fathers of the Community. The&s;e magi&s;trates are cho&s;en annually. They may be con|tinued in office for &s;everal years, at the will of the community; but there mu&s;t be a new election every year. The Pode&s;ta, by him&s;elf, may determine cau&s;es to the value of ten livres; and united with the <HI>Padri del commune,</HI> or Fathers of the Country, may finally determine cau&s;es to the value of 50 livres. The Pode&s;ta is the repre&s;entative of the government, and to him are addre&s;&s;ed all the orders of the &s;u|preme
<PB N="251" REF="254">
council. The Padri del commune &s;uperin|tend the economy and police of the village, call the people together, and con&s;ult with them on every thing that concerns their intere&s;t. Sometimes the people choo&s;e two Pode&s;tas and one Padri del com|mune, and &s;ometimes more, and &s;ometimes fewer coun&s;ellors. The&s;e irregularities are permitted to humour the caprice of different villages in an infant &s;tate, and are of no con&s;equence; for the &s;ame de|gree of power remains to each office, whether it be held by a le&s;&s;er, or a greater number; as in the &s;tates of Holland, tho&s;e who &s;end two or three re|pre&s;entatives, have but an equal voice with tho&s;e who &s;end only one.</P>
<P>Once a year, the inhabitants of each village a&s;|&s;emble them&s;elves, and choo&s;e a Procurator, to re|pre&s;ent them in the general con&s;ulta, or parliament of the nation, which is held annually in the month of May, at the City of Corte. This procurator is elected by a majority of voices. Each of them have from their community, a livre a day, to bear his charges from the time of his &s;itting out, till his re|turn home.</P>
<P>Sometimes the procurators of all the villages con|tained in the &s;ame pieve, choo&s;e from among them|&s;elves one, who goes as repre&s;entative from the pieve,
<PB N="252" REF="255">
which &s;aves &s;ome expence to the villages. But this is abu&s;e, and when matters of any con&s;equence are de|liberating, it renders the number of tho&s;e who are to con&s;ult, too &s;mall. A little expence &s;hould be de&s;pi&s;ed, in compari&s;on of having a voice in mak|ing the laws, and &s;ettling the mo&s;t &s;erious concerns of the country; and the greater the number of voices, the more does the a&s;&s;embly approach to the idea of a Roman Comitia.</P>
<P>The general con&s;ulta, is indeed a numerous a&s;|&s;embly; for be&s;ides the ordinary procurators, it is u&s;ual to call in tho&s;e who have been formerly mem|bers of the &s;upreme council, and &s;everal of tho&s;e who have lo&s;t their fathers or near relations in the &s;er|vice of their country, that the blood of heroes may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by public honours.</P>
<P>When all the procurators are a&s;&s;embled at Corte, they proceed to the election of the pre&s;ident and orator of the general con&s;ulta. The pre&s;ident go|verns during the &s;itting of the a&s;&s;embly. The orator reads the different papers &s;ubjected to deliberation. Tho&s;e from the people, are addre&s;&s;ed to the orator. If a propo&s;ition from the government, or &s;upreme council of &s;tate, an&s;wering to our privy council, is approved by a majority of voices, it is immediately pa&s;&s;ed into a law. But a propo&s;ition from the peo|ple,
<PB N="253" REF="256">
though approved of, may be &s;u&s;pended by the government, without a&s;&s;igning their rea&s;ons; which, however, they are &s;trictly obliged to do the next general con&s;ulta.</P>
<P>Each province, of which, as we have already &s;aid, there are nine, appoints its repre&s;entative in the &s;u|preme council for the en&s;uing year; and one of the&s;e is elected into the office of great Chancellor. The &s;upreme council of the time, being with the general of the kingdom, form the executive govern|ment of the whole nation; the general con&s;ulta de|volving upon them that high commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The general holds his office for life. He is per|petual pre&s;ident of the &s;upreme council of nine. He votes in all que&s;tions; and in ca&s;e of an equa|lity, he has a ca&s;ting vote. He is ab&s;olute com|mander of the troops or militia of the i&s;land. His office much re&s;embles that of Stadtholder in Hol|land.</P>
<P>In the general con&s;ulta, are al&s;o cho&s;en &s;ome per|&s;ons of high credit and re&s;pect, as &s;yndicatori. The&s;e make a tour through the different provinces, as our judges in England go the circuits. They hear complaints again&s;t the different magi&s;trates; and if any of them have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed their duty, they are
<PB N="254" REF="257">
properly cen&s;ured. The&s;e &s;yndicators are extreme|ly beneficial. The general him&s;elf is almo&s;t always one of them. They &s;ave poor people the trouble and expence of going to Corte to lay their griev|ances before the &s;upreme council. They examine into every thing concerning the provinces, reconcile the people to the whole&s;ome &s;everity of law, encou|rage indu&s;try, and diffu&s;e a &s;pirit of order and civi|lization through the i&s;land.</P>

<P>The &s;tate of learning in Cor&s;ica, may well be ima|gined at a low ebb, &s;ince it was the determined pur|po&s;e of Genoa, to keep the inhabitants of this i&s;land in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance; and the confu&s;ions and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of war, have left them no lei&s;ure to attend to any kind of &s;tudy. That laws are &s;ilent amid&s;t the din of arms, is an old ob&s;ervation; and it may be ju&s;tly applied to the mu&s;es, whom war frightens away from every country. A univer&s;ity was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed at Corte, in the year 1764, and a manife&s;to publi&s;hed, recalling to the people of Cor&s;ica, the barbarous policy of Genoa, in keeping them in ig|norance; and informing them of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, which the parental care of the government had formed for their in&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="259">The profe&s;&s;ors in the univer&s;ity of Corte, are mo&s;tly fathers of different religious orders. They are indefatigable in their labours, and the youth of Cor&s;ica di&s;cover the &s;ame keenne&s;s of &s;pirit in their &s;tudies, which characteri&s;es them in arms. There are at Corte, &s;ome pretty good halls, where the profe&s;&s;ors give their lectures. But it cannot be ex|pected, that they &s;hould as yet have any thing like the regular building of a college. The &s;tudents are boarded in the town.</P>
<P>Under the head of learning, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that there is a printing hou&s;e at Corte, and a book|&s;eller's &s;hop. Here are printed, however, nothing more than the public manife&s;toes, calendars of fea&s;t days, and little practical devotional pieces, as al&s;o the Cor&s;ican gazette, which is publi&s;hed by autho|rity, from time to time, ju&s;t as news are collected; for it contains nothing but the news of the i&s;land. It admits no foreign intelligence, nor private anec|dotes; &s;o that there will &s;ometimes be an interval of three months, during which, no new&s;papers are pub|li&s;hed.</P>
<P>There are in Cor&s;ica, &s;everal treati&s;es of political controver&s;y, &s;aid in the title, to be printed at Corte, but they are in reality, printed at Lucca, or Leg|horn. In &s;ome of the&s;e treati&s;es, which are pretty
<PB N="257" REF="260">
numerous, the authors, with much ea&s;e and thought, labour to prove to a demon&s;tration, that the Cor&s;i|cans mu&s;t be free. Their writings are a good deal in the &s;tile of the profound tracts, for and again&s;t the hereditary and indefea&s;ible right of kings, with which all the libraries in this country were filled in the la&s;t age. Authorities are heaped upon authori|ties, to e&s;tabli&s;h the plainne&s;t propo&s;itions; and as the poet &s;ays, they 'quote the Stagyrite, to prove that &s;moak a&s;cends, and &s;now is white.'</P>
<P>The language of the Cor&s;icans, is remarkable good Italian, tinctured a little with &s;ome remains of the dialects of the barbarous nations, and with a few Genoe&s;e corruptions, but much purer than in many of the Italian &s;tates. Their pronunciation, however, is &s;omewhat coar&s;e.</P>
<P>The religion of Cor&s;ica, is the Roman Catholic faith, in which the&s;e i&s;landers are very zealous. Perhaps they have a degree of &s;uper&s;tition, which is the be&s;t extreme. No nation can pro&s;per without piety; for when that fails, public &s;pirit, and every noble &s;entiment will decay. The doctrine of look|ing up to an All-ruling Providence, and that of a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, rendered the Roman people virtuous and great. In propor|tion as the&s;e doctrines were weakened by the fal&s;e
<PB N="258" REF="261">
philo&s;ophy of <HI>Epicurus,</HI> the minds of the Romans were impoveri&s;hed, and their manly patrioti&s;m was &s;ucceeded by effeminate &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which quickly brought them to contempt and ruin.</P>
<P>Although firmly attached to their religion, as the revelation &s;ent from God, the Cor&s;icans pre&s;erve, in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, the &s;ame &s;pirit of boldne&s;s and freedom, for which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed in civil af|fairs. They are &s;worn enemies to the temporal power of the church.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ican bi&s;hops, who are five in number, and &s;uffragans of the archbi&s;hop of Pi&s;a, were warmly attached to Genoa, during their la&s;t com|motions with that &s;tate; for on Genoa they depended for promotion. They thought fit to preach up the mo&s;t &s;lavi&s;h doctrines of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and &s;tigmatized the patriots as rebels. Government de&s;ired that they might re&s;ide in the territories of the nation, and promi&s;ed them a guard to protect them from any in&s;ult. But the bi&s;hops knew well, that in the terri|tories of the nation, they could not preach the doc|trines of tyranny, and therefore refu&s;ed to re&s;ide there. Upon which, the government &s;eque&s;tered their reve|nues, and prohibited the patriots from having any intercour&s;e with the bi&s;hops; with which they mo&s;t readily complied.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="262">The clergy of Cor&s;ica, in general, are not as yet very learned; as the barbarous policy of Genoa, to keep the i&s;land in ignorance, and the many years of confu&s;ion and war, have prevented the cultivation of letters. There are, however, here and there &s;ome prie&s;ts, who have had an education upon the conti|nent, and are very well in&s;tructed, and they are all very pious, and of irreproachable morals.</P>
<P>There are in Cor&s;ica, 65 convents of Mendicant friars; viz. 34 of ob&s;ervants, 14 of reformed of the order of S. <HI>Francis,</HI> and 17 of capuchins. Every one of the&s;e convents, has only a wood for retired walks, a garden, and a &s;mall vineyard. They depend al|together on the charity of the people. There are two colleges of Je&s;uits, two convents of Dominicans, five of Servites, and one of Mi&s;&s;ionaries; all of whom have very good po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. There are al&s;o &s;ome lands belonging to other religious orders, particu|larly to the Carthu&s;ians of Pi&s;a, the &s;evere &s;anctity of whom, mu&s;t &s;ecure them the veneration of every body, and pre&s;erve their rights inviolated, even in times of the greate&s;t di&s;traction.</P>
<P>It would be expected, that in this i&s;land, the mo|na&s;teries for women, &s;hould bear &s;ome proportion to the convents for men; yet, in fact, there is not a &s;ingle nunnery in all Cor&s;ica. To account for this,
<PB N="260" REF="263">
it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that the mona&s;tic in&s;titution has been frequently perverted to &s;ecular purpo&s;es, &s;o that the nobility in catholic countries, who are de|&s;irous to aggrandize their families, make their daugh|ters take the veil, that their portions may be &s;aved to the elde&s;t &s;on. The Genoe&s;e, who wanted to keep the Cor&s;icans in continual &s;ubjection, devi&s;ed every method to prevent any of the nobles in the i&s;land, from becoming con&s;iderable. They therefore pro|hibited manufactories, in order to cut them off from one method of growing richer. Friars, they rather encouraged, in order to le&s;&s;en population, and to leave upon families a number of unmarried women, than which nothing can be a greater burden, as is &s;adly experienced in prote&s;tant countries.</P>
<P>Convents &s;hould be laid under &s;uch re&s;trictions, that what is intended as a &s;olemn, religious in&s;titu|tion, may not become &s;o common as to lo&s;e its ef|fect, and be reckoned a profe&s;&s;ion for the dull or the indolent.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF SPAIN, FROM SWINBURNE, TOWNSHEND, TWISS, AND OTHERS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> General Hi&s;tory, Situation, Climate, and Productions, Mountains, Rivers, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SPAIN is bounded on the north by the Pyrenees, which &s;eparate it from France; on the ea&s;t by the Medi|terranean, on the &s;outh by the Streights of Gibraltar, and on the we&s;t, by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is upwards of 260 leagues in length, from the &s;outh-we&s;t, to the north-ea&s;t, and 170 leagues in breadth.</P>
<P>Spain, from its po&s;ition, climate, and fertility, has been the victim of ho&s;tile nations. The Phenici|ans are the fir&s;t, of which we find traces in hi&s;tory. This people, to whom commerce taught philo&s;ophy, landed upon the coa&s;ts of Spain, and their fir&s;t &s;et|tlement,
<PB N="262" REF="266">
was, it is &s;aid, at Cadiz. The Carthagi|nians, not le&s;s de&s;irous of profit and plunder, thought proper to di&s;pute with them a &s;oil, le&s;s &s;corched, and more fertile, than that of Africa; they al&s;o founded colonies, but not without having fir&s;t &s;hed much blood. The ancient inhabitants having but few other wants than tho&s;e of nature, and not di&s;covering their future tyrants in the new colo|ni&s;ts, amu&s;ed them&s;elves with hunting, fi&s;hing, and peacefully drinking the milk of their flocks. Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing but little knowledge of commerce and navi|gation, they left the care and profits of the&s;e, and with them all di&s;putes, to the Phenicians and Cartha|ginians.</P>
<P>But the wars between the&s;e people were not of long duration, becau&s;e commerce loves tranquillity, and endeavours to repel violence, without aiming at military fame. All their quarrels would have been terminated by a &s;olid pence, had Rome &s;een without envy the aggrandizement and &s;ucce&s;s of her rival. The Romans took the fir&s;t opportunity of driving the Carthaginians from Spain. This kingdom became the theatre of two of the mo&s;t famous wars of an|tiquity. By the fir&s;t, which la&s;ted 24 years, Rome obliged Carthage to cede to her a part of her con|que&s;ts; and by the &s;econd, which continued but
<PB N="263" REF="267">
for 17 years, Carthage was entirely &s;tripped of her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and her power.</P>
<P>The Phenicians, Greeks, and Carthaginians, had only gone, as it may be &s;aid, to Spain. The Ro|mans e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves there, and became ab|&s;olate ma&s;ters of the kingdom. Under them, Spain was divided into Baetica, Lu&s;itania, and Tarraconen|&s;is. The fir&s;t comprehended Grenada, Upper and Lower Andalu&s;ia, and a part of New Ca&s;tile. Lu&s;i|tania extended from the river Guadiana to the Douro; and Tarraconen&s;is as exten&s;ive as the other two divi&s;ions, comprehended the ea&s;t of the king|dom. The ancients have left very animated ac|counts of this monarchy. <HI>Strabo</HI> is the author who de&s;cribes it with the greate&s;t truth: he &s;ays, it is a mountainous and difficult country, and that the mountains, by which it is divided, are for the mo&s;t part barren: he does ju&s;tice, however, to the ferti|lity of Andalu&s;ia. All his third book is peculiarly intere&s;ting for &s;uch per&s;ons as de&s;ire to have a per|fect knowledge of that part of Europe.</P>
<P>The Romans po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this rich and exten&s;ive pe|nin&s;ula, about 600 years. Towards the fifth cen|tury, a &s;warm of barbarians fell upon the fine pro|vinces of the Roman empire. The Goths in part, invaded and conquered Spain. They reigned there
<PB N="264" REF="268">
130 years. <HI>Roderic</HI> was the la&s;t of their kings; the famous battle of Xerxes, in 712, put the Moors in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t and fine&s;t part of Spain. The hi&s;tory of <HI>Roderic</HI> is enveloped in an infinity of fables. He is &s;aid to have entered a grotto at Toledo, where he found a &s;heet, upon which was painted a man of gigantic &s;tature, in an African ha|bit, and holding an in&s;cription, &s;ignifying that Spain, &s;hould one day be &s;ubjugated by &s;uch a race of men. Another fable, repeated by &s;everal hi&s;to|rians, is, that <HI>Roderic</HI> having ill treated <HI>Cara,</HI> a young and beautiful lady of his court, and likewi&s;e treated her father, Count <HI>Julian,</HI> with great indignity, who demanded &s;atisfaction for her injured honor, the latter invited the Moors into Spain, to be revenged on his &s;overeign.</P>
<P>The&s;e becoming quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of their rapid and brilliant conque&s;ts, the dawn of the re&s;plendent reigns of the &s;overeigns of Cordova, Seville, and Granada began to appear. The court of Abdal|rahman, was the centre of arts, &s;ciences, plea&s;ures, and gallantry. Tournaments, the image of war, in which love and addre&s;s were &s;ub&s;tituted for valour and courage, continued for &s;everal centuries, the amu&s;ements of a rich and fortunate people. The women were con&s;tantly pre&s;ent at games, the only end of which was to plea&s;e them, and excited a
<PB N="265" REF="269">
tender emulation. The voluptuous Arabs aimed at &s;plendid atchievements, to render them&s;elves more worthy of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. To them are we in|debted for plaintive romance, in which &s;eductive love a&s;&s;umes the air of melancholy, the better to in|tere&s;t our affections: poetry and mu&s;ic were favorite arts with the Moors. The number of academies and univer&s;ities increa&s;ed in Cordova and Granada; even women gave public lectures on poetry and philo&s;o|phy; and literary re&s;ources abounded in proportion to the progre&s;s of &s;cience. At that time, there were 70 academies public in Spain. Toledo, Seville, Gra|nada, and Cordova, which now pre&s;ent nothing but ru|ins and depopulation, certainly contained from three to 400,000 inhabitants. Granada is the only place in which ve&s;tiges of the &s;plendid reign of the Moors are to be found. Nothing, however, can be more confu&s;ed, than the Dyna&s;ties of the Moors or Arabs who reigned in Spain. That of the Chri&s;tian mo|narchs, who di&s;puted with them the kingdom, and taking advantage of their divi&s;ions, drove them out, is not le&s;s &s;o. Long accu&s;tomed to conquer the Moors, thus divided, they had, within little more than a century, taken from them Toledo, Cordova, Seville, and Murcia. Granada &s;till flouri&s;hed, and was become their only &s;trong hold, when Ca&s;tille and Arragon united in the per&s;ons of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> formed too great a power to be re&s;i&s;ted by
<PB N="266" REF="270">
a kingdom enfeebled by inte&s;tine commotions. Granada was reduced in 1492, after a &s;iege of two years. The Moors had reigned in Spain eight cen|turies, and were totally ruined by this defeat: per|&s;ecuted, de&s;poiled, burned, or converted, and bap|tized by thou&s;ands, they were at length driven from the kingdom, in the reign of <HI>Philip</HI> III. about the 17th century.</P>
<P>Spain is at pre&s;ent divided into 14 provinces, which are Navarre, Bi&s;cay, and the A&s;turias to the north; to the we&s;t, are Galicia and E&s;tramadura; to the &s;outh, Upper and Lower Andalu&s;ia, and the kingdom of Murcia; to the ea&s;t, that of Valencia, Arragon, and Catalonia; and in the middle of the monarchy, the kingdom of Leon, and the two Ca&s;|tiles.</P>
<P>As the character, cu&s;toms, and manners of the in|habitants of the&s;e provinces, which were formerly &s;o many di&s;tinct kingdoms, or independent &s;overeign|ties, are in many of them very different, we &s;hall treat of the principal ones apart.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t, it will be proper to ob&s;erve, that this divi&s;ion of Spain into kingdoms and provinces, as de&s;cribed in maps and geographical treati&s;es, has &s;carcely any place in fact. The government knows
<PB N="267" REF="271">
but one divi&s;ion, the province of the crown of Ca&s;|tile, and tho&s;e of the crown of Arragon. The two parts of the monarchy differ from each other, with re&s;pect to the admini&s;tration, form and collection of taxes; a di&s;tinction, which had its origin at the time when Ca&s;tile and Arragon were united by the mar|riage of <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Catholic, and which, &s;ince that time, has undergone but few alter|ations. The crown of Arragon, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only Ar|ragon, Catalonia, and the kingdom of Valencia, be|&s;ides &s;ome i&s;lands in the Mediterranean. The crown of Ca&s;tile po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the Spani&s;h monarchy.</P>
<P>The air in mo&s;t of the provinces, is pure and dry, but in June, July, and Augu&s;t, the days are in&s;uffer|ably hot, e&s;pecially in the middle of the country; in the night, a traveller &s;hivers with cold. Towards the north, and in the mountainous parts of the king|dom, the air is cooler than towards the &s;outh, and near the &s;ea contracts a con&s;iderable moi&s;ture. It &s;eldom rains, and the winter fro&s;ts are never &s;uch as to bind up the ground. Want of temperature in the heat and coolne&s;s of the air, is the cau&s;e that &s;eed lies a long time in the ground, before it &s;hoots up. The country in general, labours under a great &s;car|city of corn, which is owing in a great mea&s;ure to the neglect of agriculture; for though the &s;oil is in
<PB N="268" REF="272">
places extremely dry, and the growth of grain and other fruits, very much ob&s;tructed in the day by the exce&s;&s;ive heats, and in the night, by inten&s;e cold; yet it appears from ancient geographers and hi&s;tori|ans, that Spain formerly produced great plenty of corn, &s;o that the pre&s;ent &s;carcity of that commodity, mu&s;t proceed from the neglect of tillage. On the other hand, the mo&s;t delicious fruits are to be met with in great abundance, &s;uch as pears, peaches, olives, figs, grapes, almonds, che&s;nuts, lemons, oranges, and pomegranates. It produces al&s;o very good &s;affron. The Spani&s;h wines, particularly &s;ack, are greedily bought up by foreign nations. The value of the wine and grapes annually exported from the country round Malaga, alone amounts to one million and an half of pia&s;tres.</P>
<P>The grapes or rai&s;ins, &s;ays <HI>Twi&s;s,</HI> are of two &s;orts; tho&s;e which are called &s;un rai&s;ins, are thus made; when the grapes are almo&s;t ripe, the &s;talk is cut half through, &s;o that the &s;ap may not penetrate far|ther, but yet that the bunch of grapes may remain &s;u&s;pended by the &s;talk. The &s;un, by darting on them, candies them, and when they are dry, they are packed up in boxes. The &s;econd &s;ort is made after the following manner: when the vines are pruned, the tendrils are pre&s;erved till the time of vintage; a great fire is then made, wherein tho&s;e tendrils are
<PB N="269" REF="273">
burnt, and in the lye made from their a&s;hes, the newly gathered grapes are dipt, after which, they are expo&s;ed to the &s;un to dry, which renders them fit for u&s;e.</P>
<P>The Indian fig too, is very common in the ea&s;|tern and &s;outhern parts of Spain, and although this &s;hrub be originally from the Indies, it grows every where without cultivation. Its flower is almo&s;t the &s;ize of a common carnation: the fruit which &s;uc|ceeds the flower, re&s;embles the common fig; it &s;tains with red the urine of &s;uch as eat of it. It was by chance di&s;covered in England, that the bones of a pig, kept in the hou&s;e of a dyer, and which had been fed with madder, were &s;tained with red. The experiment was repeated and confirmed by the academy of &s;ciences at Paris.</P>
<P>The great palm tree grows in all the &s;outhern provinces of Spain, but is found in the greate&s;t abundance in the kingdom of Valencia, in the envi|rons of the Elche, when the plain is covered with them as far as the eye can reach. It is &s;aid, there are upwards of 50,000 trees, two thirds of which, are at lea&s;t 120 feet high, and form a magnificent fore&s;t. The dates they produce, hang in clu&s;ters of from 15 to 25 pounds weight at the top of the tree.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="274">Andalu&s;ia abounds with olive trees; tho&s;e of Lu|cena and the environ, produce a round little olive of a good quality for making of oil. The olives of Seville are as large as a pigeons egg, and are excel|lent for pre&s;erving.</P>
<P>Several parts of the country al&s;o produce rice and &s;ugar canes. Spain enjoys likewi&s;e great plenty of exqui&s;ite honey, and &s;ilk in abundance. Salt is procured in &s;uch abundance, that there are con&s;i|derable quantities exported. A great deal of &s;ea-&s;alt is made on the coa&s;ts, and in the i&s;land of Ma|jorca, where the &s;un &s;erves in&s;tead of fire. In this country, are to be &s;een innumerable flocks of very fine &s;heep, part of which, during winter, feed in the plains, and in the &s;ummer, are driven up again in the mountains. The number of &s;hepherds in Spain, are computed to be 40,000. The wool mo&s;t in e&s;teem, is that of Old Ca&s;tile, though the Spani&s;h wool in general, is very fine and valuable. Anda|lu&s;ia and A&s;turia are particularly famous for their hor&s;es. There are al&s;o great numbers of mules; but few horned cattle. From Andalu&s;ia are brought the wild bulls for the bull-fights.</P>
<P>The maritime parts abound in fi&s;h, among other kinds in tunny, &s;turgeon, &s;almon, lampreys, had|dock, &amp;c. But for want of improving the&s;e advan|tages,
<PB N="271" REF="275">
Spain annually purcha&s;es &s;tock and &s;alt fi&s;h- to the amount of three million of pia&s;tres.</P>
<P>Tunny, &s;ays <HI>Twi&s;s,</HI> are caught in great abundance near Conil, on the Andalu&s;ian coa&s;t. The&s;e fi&s;h are from 7 to 10 feet in length, and weigh about an hundred and an half. The Duke of Medina Sido|nia is proprietor of this fi&s;hery, which brings him in annually upwards of 10,000l. The fi&s;h is eaten fre&s;h and &s;alted; it is exported to Italy, where it &s;erves for food to the equipage of the gallies which crui&s;e in the Mediterranean; this fi&s;h is very firm and nouri&s;hing, and much re&s;embles veal.</P>
<P>Among the many mountains in Spain the Pyre|nees are the mo&s;t remarkable. The&s;e &s;eparate Spain from France, and from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic make a length of near 200 Engli&s;h miles, being in their greate&s;t breadth not le&s;s than 90. Over the&s;e Pyrenean mountains there are &s;carce five pa&s;&s;ages from Spain into France, and the&s;e very nar|row. The very vallies between the&s;e mountains are covered with thick and lofty woods. Mount Idu|bada, is a chain of mountains extending from the Pyrenees to Torto&s;a. A chain of the&s;e mountains &s;eparates the kingdom of Granada, and extends to the &s;treights of Gibraltar, where the celebrated moun|tain,
<PB N="272" REF="276">
anciently called Mount Calpe, &s;tands oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of Ceuta in Africa.</P>
<P>The&s;e mountains yield great quantities of timber for &s;hipping. According to ancient writers the mountains of Spain are very rich in gold and &s;ilver, but the Spaniards prefer importing the&s;e metals from America to &s;earching for them in their own country; but their iron mines are worked with great indu&s;try and &s;kill. Spain wants not al&s;o other mine|rals, &s;uch as lead, tin, cinnabar, alum, quick-&s;ilver, vitriol, copperas, lapis calaminaris, and likewi&s;e cry&s;tal, diamonds, amethy&s;ts, and other gems.</P>
<P>This penin&s;ula is watered by many very con&s;i|derable rivers; the&s;e are upwards of 150 in num|ber; but the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by their extent, depth, and breadth; in a word, tho&s;e which in their cour&s;e &s;wallow up the others, and afterwards empty their waters into the &s;ea, are the Elmo, the Guadal|quiver, the Tagus, the Guadiana, the Douro, the Guadalaviar, and the Segura. In giving a de&s;crip|tion of each province we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the rivers by which they are watered, and to fix the place of their &s;ource, and that where they di&s;|embogue into the ocean.</P>
<P>Having now given a general view of the climate,
<PB N="273" REF="277">
productions, and face of the country at large, we &s;hall begin to treat of the different provinces be|ginning with Catalonia, which at the time of the union was comprehended under the kingdom of Arragon.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Province of Catalonia.</HEAD>
<P>THIS province is about 20 leagues in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and from 40 to 48 in breadth. It derives its name from that of the Goths and Alans, united in the word Gothalonia, ea&s;ily changed into Catalonia. It is bounded on the north by the Pyrenees, to the ea&s;t and &s;outh by the Mediterranean, and to the we&s;t by the kingdom of Valencia, and by part of that of Arragon. It was formerly larger than at pre&s;ent, but France has at different times curtailed it of the counties of Rou&s;|&s;illon and Conflans, with a good part of Cardagne, and long &s;ince of Foix. This fine country is wa|tered
<PB N="274" REF="278">
by &s;everal rivers, &s;ome of which intermix, whil&s;t others di&s;charge them&s;elves &s;eparately into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The air of Catalonia is healthy, and the climate upon the coa&s;t temperate; but the northern part is cold, on account of the mountains. The&s;e are nu|merous in this province, but they are not &s;o barren as tho&s;e in other parts of the kingdom; the moun|tains of Catalonia are covered with wood and ver|dure. The fine and well cultivated plains of Tarra|gona, Cardagna, Vic and Urgel, produce abundance of corn, wine and vegetables of every kind.</P>
<P>The two wonders of Catalonia are Mount&s;errat and the mountain near Candona, called the &s;alt-mountain. The&s;e equally attract the attention of the devotee and the naturali&s;t. Nothing can be more picture&s;que than Mont&s;errat; it is &s;o lofty that from the top the neighbouring mountains ap|pear to be &s;unk to a level with the plain. It is compo&s;ed of &s;teep rocks which at a di&s;tance &s;eem indented, whence it is &s;aid it receives the name <HI>Mont&s;errat,</HI> from the Latin word <HI>Serras,</HI> a &s;aw. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the beauty, richne&s;s, and variety of the land&s;capes di&s;covered from the mo&s;t elevated point. They fatigue the eye, and mu&s;t undoubtedly humble every thinking man; it is &s;uf|ficient
<PB N="275" REF="279">
to ob&s;erve that the i&s;lands of Majorca and Minorca, which are at the di&s;tance of 60 leagues, are di&s;covered from this elevation.</P>
<P>The mona&s;tery, in which 60 monks live accor|ding to the rule of St. <HI>Benedict,</HI> is at the bottom of a &s;teep rock. It was there St. <HI>Ignatius</HI> devoted him|&s;elf to penitence, and formed the idea of founding the celebrated &s;ociety of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in 1522, an anecdote but little known.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of the mountain to a foreigner is the de&s;ert in which are &s;everal hermi|tages that are excellent a&s;ylums for true philo&s;ophy and contemplation. Each of the&s;e &s;olitary retreats, which at a di&s;tance &s;eem de&s;titute of every thing, has a chapel, a cell, or wall in the rock, and a little gar|den. The hermits who inhabit them are for the mo&s;t part per&s;ons of fortune and family, di&s;gu&s;ted with the world, who have retired thither to devote them&s;elves to meditation and &s;ilence.</P>
<P>People of every condition are continually going from all parts of the catholic world, but more par|ticularly from the &s;everal provinces in Spain, to vi|&s;it them, as well as the mona&s;tery which is reported to contain as great if not a greater trea&s;ure than that of Loretto. The monks &s;hew great ho&s;pitality to
<PB N="276" REF="280">
every one who goes there, having a large income for the purpo&s;e. It is however cu&s;tomary for per|&s;ons of fortune who vi&s;it them to make &s;ome return in money to the monks for their entertainment; the poor only are permitted to live there gratis dur|ing three days.</P>
<P>The other great natural curio&s;ity, the mountain of Cardona, is an inexhau&s;tible quarry of &s;alt. This mineral is found there of almo&s;t every colour, &s;o that when &s;hone upon by the rays of the &s;un, the mountains re&s;emble tho&s;e of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds, which we read of in the fanciful de&s;crip|tion of fairy land. Va&s;es, urns, and many valuable productions are made from this &s;alt; imitations of every kind of pre&s;erved fruit are &s;o perfectly wrought in it, that the eye aids the hand to deceive; there is no form that cannot be given to the &s;alt, which is ea&s;ily cut, though it has &s;ufficient &s;olidity, but pro|ductions which can receive no injury from the hand of time would quickly be di&s;&s;olved in water. The principal colours of the &s;alt are orange, violet, green, and blue, one of the particularities, and not the lea&s;t important of this mountain, is, that it is in part co|vered with &s;hrubs and plants: the top is &s;haded by a fore&s;t of pines, and the environs produce excellent wine.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="281">With re&s;pect to the general fair of this province, all through Catalonia, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> we admire at every &s;tep the indu&s;try of the inhabitants, who working early and late give fertility to a &s;oil which naturally, except for vines, is mo&s;t improductive; but when we come to Mataro, a large town on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, we are perfectly enchanted. The farms are &s;o many gardens divided every where into beds of about four feet wide, with a channel for the pa&s;|&s;age of the water to each bed. Every farm has its noria, a &s;pecies of chain pump, which from its extreme &s;implity, &s;eems to have been the inven|tion of the mo&s;t remote antiquity. By means of this machine they every morning draw a &s;ufficient quantity of water from the well for the &s;ervice of the day, and in the evening di&s;tribute it to every quarter according to the nature of their crops. The re&s;ervoirs into which they rai&s;e the water, are about 20, 30, or even 40 feet &s;quare, and three feet high, above the &s;urface of the ground, with a &s;tone cope on the wall declining to the water, for the wo|men to wa&s;h and beat their clothes upon. The &s;oil is &s;o light, being nothing but &s;and from the decom|po&s;ition of the granate, that they plough with two oxen, or one hor&s;e, or even with a mule; yet by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the water it is made fertile, and pro|duces on the &s;ame &s;pot of ground, corn, vine, oranges, and olives.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the Cities, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal city in this province is Barce|lona, and this city, &s;ays <HI>Peyron,</HI> is the only one in Spain, which at a di&s;tance announces its grandeur and population. The traveller when half a league from Madrid would &s;carcely &s;u&s;pect he was ap|proaching a great city, much le&s;s the capital of the kingdom, were it not for the high and numerous &s;teeples which &s;eem to ri&s;e from the mid&s;t of a barren &s;oil, whereas in the environs of Barcelona an immen&s;e number of country hou&s;es, carriages, and pa&s;&s;engers prepare us for a rich and commer|cial city.</P>
<P>The building of Barcelona, according to hi&s;tori|ans, was about 230 years prior to the chri&s;tian Aera, and 300 &s;ub&s;equent to the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Carthaginians in Spain. It is &s;aid to have been called Barkino by its founder, in honour of his family, and to have derived from the Jews the commercial &s;pirit which it has con&s;tantly retained.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="283">It was early delivered from the dominion of the Moors, and rai&s;ed into a county, paying homage to the kings of France, till they, unable to protect it, re&s;igned their claims, leaving the citizens to their own exertions for the vindication of their freedom. Towards the clo&s;e of the 12th century, it was an|nexed by the marriage of its Count to the crown of Arragon; and at a &s;ub&s;equent period, by the union of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> it became a part of the Spa|ni&s;h monarchy.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was di&s;puted in 1700, be|tween the two hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Bourbon, on the death of <HI>Charles</HI> II. of Spain, this city was of too much importance to the two contending parties, to remain long in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of either. The French were ma&s;ters of the city, when the Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> arrived upon the coa&s;t with his little army, a force too incon&s;iderable to attempt a &s;iege with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. But as this gallant officer had that which &s;upplies the want of more nu|merous armies, an imagination fertile in re&s;ources, his friends never de&s;paired of &s;ucce&s;s, till they &s;aw him re-embark his troops and prepare for &s;ailing. The moment of de&s;pair to them, was to the be|&s;ieged, the revival of their confidence, and the &s;ignal of futurity. He &s;ailed, but in the night di&s;embarked his troops, and before morning, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="280" REF="284">
Monjuich. After a few days more, he was ma&s;ter of the city.</P>
<P>Tarragon, Torto&s;a, and Lerida, followed the ex|ample of the capital, and declared for <HI>Charles.</HI> Wherever the Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> carried his arms, victory declared for him. It was &s;ufficient to &s;hew him&s;elf, and every city offered him its keys. When he was &s;uperceded, a &s;eries of misfortunes too well known, ha&s;tened the fall of the Arch-Duke's dominions; and the citizens of Barcelona, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, opening their gates to <HI>Philip,</HI> &s;ubmitted, though reluctantly, to bear the yoke.</P>
<P>A &s;pacious and airy walk round the walls, with the inclo&s;ed gardens, contributes towards mak|ing Barcelona one of the mo&s;t delightful cities in the world. No one who has been there in the &s;pring, will be ever weary in expatiating on the plea|&s;ures he enjoyed.</P>
<P>This city, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> is &s;ituated in a &s;weet &s;pot; the air equal in purity, and much excels in mildne&s;s the boa&s;ted climate of Montpellier. Ex|cept in the dog days, there are green pea&s;e all the year round. The &s;ituation is beautiful, the appear|ance both from land and water highly picture&s;que.
<PB N="281" REF="285">
A great extent of fruitful plains bounded by an am|phitheatre of hills, backs it on the we&s;t &s;ide; the mountain of Montjuich defends it on the &s;outh from the unwhole&s;ome winds that blow over the mar&s;hes at the mouth of the Llobregat; to the northward the coa&s;t projecting into the &s;ea forms a noble bay; and it has the Mediterranean to clo&s;e the pro&s;pect of the ea&s;t. The environs are in a &s;tate of high cultivation, &s;tudded with villages, country hou&s;es, and gardens.</P>
<P>Barcelona, as a re&s;idence, is not only delightful but healthy. There are, indeed, &s;ome days, when all the inhabitants, but more e&s;pecially &s;trangers, are inclined to think it both unplea&s;ant and unhealthy; that is, when the ea&s;t wind brings in the fog, which for many days before had been ob&s;erved &s;tanding off at &s;ea, as if watching and waiting for an opportunity to land. The pores are then locked up, and the temper becomes &s;o irritable, that the be&s;t friends mu&s;t be careful how they meet. But no &s;ooner does the land breeze &s;pring up, than the fog retires, the &s;un breaks out, and all nature wears a &s;mile. In Barcelonetta, and the citadel, in which a garri&s;on of 5,500 men is quartered, intermittents never cea&s;e to rage, and bring on in winter, drop&s;ies and jaundices, and in &s;ummer malignant fevers. The &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es reign beyond Montjuich, in the low
<PB N="282" REF="286">
country, watered by the Llobregat; but although the prevailing wind in its pa&s;&s;age becomes loaded with noxious vapours, yet being diverted from its cour&s;e by that high mountain, it has no baleful in|fluence on Barcelona.</P>
<P>The fortifications of Monjuich, a high mountain, which bound the city to the we&s;t are reckoned perfect in their kind; they are highly fini&s;hed, and for beauty do credit to the nation. The&s;e, in addition to the &s;trong works round the city, and the citadel, mu&s;t render Barcelona untenable by an enemy.</P>
<P>If my conjecture, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> be well founded, Monjuich mu&s;t not merely have been covered with the &s;ea, and this fact is beyond a doubt, but it mu&s;t have been relatively lower, and much lower than the granite mountains, by who&s;e &s;poils it was con|po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, being accumulated at the conflux of two or more currents, as we &s;ee in miniature in torrents, or at the junction of two &s;treams. Whoever is well acquainted with the external appearance, and inter|nal &s;tructure of the country round Southampton, will &s;ee a &s;triking example of this accumulation, not from matter brought by either of its rivers, for their beds are too low for &s;uch an operation, but by the action of currents, when the &s;urrounding hills of Su&s;&s;ex, Wilt&s;hire, Dor&s;et&s;hire, and the i&s;le of
<PB N="283" REF="287">
Wight, were under the &s;urface of the &s;ea, as we mu&s;t conclude from the fo&s;&s;ile &s;hells, found in the chalk on every one of the&s;e hills.</P>
<P>The appellation of Monjuich has never been pro|perly explained. They anciently wrote Monjouy, but the pronunciation is Monjuique, which may po&s;|&s;ibly mean, mountain of the Jews. Certain it is, that the Jews were numerous in this part of Spain, and that on the hill looking towards the city, there are mo|numental in&s;criptions in Hebrew characters, on large hewn rocks. Many of the words are &s;carcely legi|ble, but by tho&s;e which can be read, that &s;pot ap|pears to have been the burial place of the Jews. This mountain commands a view over the coa&s;t, plain, and harbour; not a &s;ingle hou&s;e in Barcelona but lies expo&s;ed to the &s;ight.</P>
<P>The form of Barcelona is almo&s;t circular, the Roman town being on the highe&s;t ground, in the center of the new one; the ancient walls are &s;till vi|&s;ible in &s;everal places, but the &s;ea has retired many hundreds of yards from the port gates; one of the principal gothic churches, and a whole quarter of the city, &s;tands upon the &s;ands that were once the bottom of the harbour.</P>
<P>The port is hand&s;ome, and the mole all of hewn
<PB N="284" REF="288">
&s;tone, being a ma&s;ter piece of &s;olidity and conve|nience; above is a platform for carriages, and be|low va&s;t magazines, with a broad key, reaching from the city gates to the light hou&s;e. This grand im|provement was planned and executed by the late Marquis <HI>de la Minas.</HI> Great are the obligations Barcelona has to him, he clean&s;ed and beautified its &s;treets, built u&s;eful edifices, and forwarded its trade and manufactures without much extraordi|nary expence to the province, for he had more re|&s;ources, and made money go farther than mo&s;t other governors either could or even wi&s;h to do. On the neck of land running into the &s;ea, and form|ing the port, he pulled down &s;ome fi&s;hermen's huts, and in 1752 began to build Barceloneta a regular town, con&s;i&s;ting of about 2000 brick hou&s;es, quar|ters for a regiment, and a church in which his a&s;hes are depo&s;ited. As the land was given gratis, the hou&s;es were &s;oon run up on a regular plan; a ground floor and one &s;tory above, with three win|dows in front, and a pediment over them, the whole con&s;i&s;ting of about 20 &s;treets, &amp;c. containing near 10,000 inhabitants.</P>
<P>It gives plea&s;ure, &s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI> to &s;ee the plea&s;ing uniformity of all the hou&s;es running parallel to each other from the beginning to the end of every &s;treet. No hou&s;e has more than one &s;tory be&s;ides
<PB N="285" REF="289">
the ground floor, and the &s;treets are wide enough to admit of two and even three carriages abrea&s;t. The front of every hou&s;e is covered with white pla&s;ter, which, as it is laid on very &s;mooth, &s;hines like marble half poli&s;hed. Yet the glare proves not offen&s;ive to the eye, as the intercolumniations are coloured with a pale red, and the window &s;hutters painted green.</P>
<P>On conditions they conform to this plan, and provided they are catholics, &s;trangers are admitted indi&s;criminately with the natives to build as many hou&s;es as they plea&s;e, and to have equally with the natives, the &s;oil for nothing.</P>
<P>To this advantage are added two others, that of being naturalized without any other formality; and having the faith of government pledged to them that they &s;hall never pay any ground-rent, nor other tax whatever, on account of any building they may erect.</P>
<P>Another of La <HI>Minas's</HI> improvements is the ram|part or great walk upon the walls, extending the whole length of the harbour. The whole is built upon arches, with magazines below, and a broad coach road, and foot path above, rai&s;ed to the level of the fir&s;t floor of the hou&s;es in the adjoining &s;treet.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="290">The citadel has &s;ix &s;trong ba&s;tions calculated to overawe the inhabitants as much as to defend them from a foreign enemy. The lowne&s;s of its &s;itua|tion renders it damp, unwhole&s;ome and &s;warming with mo&s;quitos. The Major of this fortre&s;s owes his promotion to a &s;ingular circum&s;tance. When the late king arrived at Madrid in 1759, a magni|ficent bull fea&s;t was given in honour of that event: it being nece&s;&s;ary upon &s;uch occa&s;ions that tho&s;e who fight on hor&s;eback &s;hould be gentlemen, the managers of the exhibition were greatly at a lo&s;s; till this man who was a poor &s;tarving officer pre|&s;ented him&s;elf, though utterly ignorant both of bull-fighting and hor&s;eman&s;hip. By dint of re&s;olu|tion, and the particular favor of fortune, he kept his &s;eat, and performed his part &s;o much to the public &s;atisfaction that he was rewarded with a pen&s;ion and a majority.</P>
<P>The &s;treets of Barcelona are narrow and crooked like tho&s;e of all ancient cities, but they are well paved; a covered drain in the middle of each &s;treet, carries off the filth and rain water. At night they are tolerably well lighted up, but long before day-break every lamp is out. The hou&s;es are lofty and plain. To each kind of trade a particular di&s;trict is allotted.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="291">Of the four gates that the town has, there are two on the &s;ea &s;ide; at one of which, people go out, but mu&s;t come in at the other. A good contrivance to facilitate the in&s;pection of whatever is not to be in|troduced without the previous payment of cu&s;tom duties.</P>
<P>Within the town, and ju&s;t by the playhou&s;e, there is a large &s;quare, called La Rambla, where on &s;um|mer evenings, people of both &s;exes re&s;ort to walk, and conver&s;e until &s;upper time, and often during the be&s;t part of the night, as is the general cu&s;tom in Spain, where every town has a &s;quare, or at lea&s;t a &s;treet, dedicated to &s;uch evening conver&s;ations.</P>
<P>The old Roman town may &s;till be di&s;tinctly traced with one of its gates, and &s;ome of its towers well pre|&s;erved. In this are many &s;arcophagi, altars, images, and in&s;criptions, with a temple of Neptune: there are al&s;o the remains of a palace of the Praetor, or Roman Governor; in the court yard of which, is a beautiful ci&s;tern, or rather &s;arcophagus, which now &s;erves as a watering trough for mules. They call it the coffin of <HI>Pompey's</HI> father, and it may as well be his, as that of any other per&s;on, as we have no proof to the contrary. A large bas-relief runs round it of hunters, dogs, and wild bea&s;ts. The chief per&s;on is on hor&s;eback, bare-headed, in a military dre&s;s. The
<PB N="288" REF="292">
figures and animals are executed in a ma&s;terly &s;tile, and the whole is a fine monument of antiquity.</P>
<P>It was in this city, that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> re|ceived <HI>Columbus,</HI> returning from America, and from hence that navigator &s;ailed on his &s;econd expedition, in 1493.</P>
<P>In viewing the churches of Barcelona, &s;ays <HI>Town|&s;end,</HI> an ob&s;ervation is confirmed, which had oc|curred even in the mo&s;t contemptible of the coun|try villages, &s;outh of the Pyrenees, namely, that all their decorations were invented about the beginning of the 16th century, after the gold and &s;ilver of America had been brought to Spain, and every altar piece with every column, &s;hews that their improve|ment in ta&s;te, did not keep pace with their increa&s;e of wealth. Riches came upon them by &s;urpri&s;e, and found them unprepared to make a proper u&s;e of the abundant trea&s;ure. Hence even the compo&s;ite and Corinthian pillars are loaded with new orna|ments, and whether fluted or contorted, they are en|twined by ivy and by vines, and are almo&s;t hid by the multitude of angels fluttering round them, or by cherubs climbing up the branches; and the whole of this prepo&s;terous a&s;&s;emblage, is covered with one glare of gold.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="293">The principal edifices are the cathedral, Santa Maria, the General's palace, and the Exchange. The architecture of the cathedral, is a light gothic, which in the ornaments of the cloi&s;ters, is inimitably airy. The &s;talls of the choir are neatly carved, and hung with e&s;cutcheons of princes and noblemen, among which are the arms of our <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. In the cloy&s;ters, various kinds of foreign birds are kept upon funds bequeathed for that purpo&s;e by a wealthy canon. I could not learn, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> what motives induced him to make &s;o whim&s;ical a devi&s;e. Santa Maria is al&s;o a gothic pile. The palace is &s;quare and low, without out-courts or gardens, and contains nothing worthy of remark, but a noble ball|room, in which are the portraits of all the ancient Counts of Barcelona.</P>
<P>The exchange, which is not yet fini&s;hed, is oppo|&s;ite the Governor's palace, and will be one of the fine&s;t monuments in the city; &s;ome of the halls or chambers are occupied by the Junto of commerce, and others &s;erve for drawing-&s;chools, like tho&s;e of Paris, where the art of drawing is taught <HI>gratis.</HI> This academy of the noble arts, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> is open to all the world, and all tho&s;e who chu&s;e to attend, are gratuitou&s;ly taught drawing, architecture, and &s;culpture, under the direction of able ma&s;ters. For this purpo&s;e, there are &s;even &s;pacious halls, fi|ni&s;hed
<PB N="290" REF="294">
at the king's expence, with tables, benches, lights, paper, pencils, drawings, models, clay, and living &s;ubjects; the &s;tudents a&s;&s;emble in the morn|ing, from 10 to 12, and in the evening, from &s;ix to eight in winter, and from eight to ten in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>I counted, &s;ays the above author, one night, up|wards of 500 boys, many of whom were fini&s;hing de&s;igns, which &s;hewed either &s;uperior genius, or more than common application. It is not to be imagined, that all the&s;e boys, or perhaps any of them, were de&s;tined to be painters; this was not the inten|tion of government, much le&s;s of the nobleman who &s;ugge&s;ted the in&s;titution. Mo&s;t, if not all the&s;e youths, are apprenticed to trades; and it is well ima|gined, that every other art may receive &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;|tance from this, who&s;e peculiar property it is to ex|cel in imitation. Such in&s;titutions are much wanted in England. Not only the &s;culptor, the architect, and the engineer, but the coach-maker, the cabinet-maker, the weaver, and even the taylor and the haberda&s;her, may derive great advantages from that accuracy of &s;ight, and that fertility of invention, which are acquired by the practice of drawing and de&s;igning.</P>
<P>One of the &s;even halls is fitted up for a nautical &s;chool, and provided with every thing needful to
<PB N="291" REF="295">
teach the art of navigation. The &s;tudents a&s;&s;emble every morning from eight to ten, and every evening from three to five. Since the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of this u&s;eful &s;eminary, they have &s;ent more than 500 pilots, qualified to navigate a ve&s;&s;el to any quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>Equally well furni&s;hed with the preceding, and equally well conducted is the military academy, in which are three magnificent apartments for the &s;tu|dents to pur&s;ue their &s;tudies from the fir&s;t elements of the mathematics, to the higher branches of their profe&s;&s;ion. This, and &s;imilar academies, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the reigning monarch, are of va&s;t importance to the nation, as furni&s;hing a &s;ufficient &s;upply of en|gineers in time of war, without the nece&s;&s;ity of de|pending, as in former periods, wholly on its allies. The&s;e &s;eminaries in Spain, are the only &s;chools in which the mathematics can be &s;tudied to advantage; for although in all the univer&s;ities, profe&s;&s;ors are ap|pointed, they are &s;aid to be wholly ignorant of this &s;cience, which they profe&s;s to teach.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e in&s;titutions for the in&s;truction of &s;uch as are devoted to arts or arms, there are not wanting &s;ome of more general utility, acce&s;&s;ible to all the citizens, without di&s;tinction. The&s;e are a cabinet of natural hi&s;tory, and the public libraries, of

<P>Vi&s;iting the churches at all hours, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> whenever any &s;ervice was to be performed, I made a party with &s;ome friends to hear a penitential &s;er|vice, which is &s;o &s;ingular, I cannot help relating it.

The fir&s;t part of the <HI>Mi&s;erere</HI> was no &s;ooner ended, than the doors were &s;hut, the lights extingui&s;hed, and we remained in perfect darkne&s;s. At this moment, when the eye could no longer find an ob|ject to di&s;tract the mind, the attention was awakened by the voice of harmony, the whole congregation joining in the <HI>Mi&s;erere,</HI> which they &s;ung with plea&s;|ing &s;olemnity: at fir&s;t with &s;oft and plaintive notes; but having laid bare their naked backs, and pre|pared them for the &s;courge; they all began nearly at the &s;ame in&s;tant to u&s;e the di&s;cipline, rai&s;ing their voices, and quickening the time, increa&s;ing by de|grees, both in velocity and violence, and &s;courging them&s;elves with greater vehemence as they pro|ceeded, then &s;inging louder and har&s;her, till at the end of about 20 minutes, all di&s;tinction of &s;ound was lo&s;t, and the whole ended in one deep groan. This di&s;cipline is repeated every Friday in the year, oftener in Lent, and is their daily practice during the holy week.</P>
<P>The <HI>ho&s;picio,</HI> or hou&s;e of indu&s;try, next merits be|ing noticed. There are in this ho&s;pital, generally about 1450 paupers. The expence is e&s;timated about 5000l. a year. The women and children are employed in knitting, &s;pinning, and making lace. The men card, comb, &s;pin, and weave cotton, flax, and wool. Although no paupers can be either
<PB N="294" REF="298">
better clad, better fed, better attended, or better lodged, or can meet with greater tenderne&s;s when &s;ick; yet they cannot readily forget their lo&s;s of li|berty, and few be&s;ides the mo&s;t decrepit, would re|main within tho&s;e walls, if they could be permitted to beg their bread from door to door. This princi|ple, however, is productive of much good, for mo&s;t of the young men of Barcelona, of any worth or &s;pirit, form them&s;elves into clubs for mutual relief, in the &s;ame manner, and nearly upon the &s;ame plan, adopted by our friendly &s;ocieties in England. The&s;e fraternities have each its firm, taken from the name of the &s;aint, to who&s;e protection it is recommended. They are upon the mo&s;t re&s;pectable footing, and being well conducted, leave none but the mo&s;t im|provident and mo&s;t worthle&s;s &s;ubjects to be di&s;graced by confinement among fools and madmen. Of the 1450 paupers, it &s;hould have been ob&s;erved there are 300 idiots.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e a hou&s;e of correction, too re|markable to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. It embraces two objects; the fir&s;t is the reformation of pro&s;titutes and female thieves; the &s;econd, the correction of &s;uch women as fail in their obligation to their hu&s;|bands, and of tho&s;e who either neglect or di&s;grace their families. The hou&s;e for the&s;e purpo&s;es, is divided into di&s;tinct portions, without any commu|nication
<PB N="295" REF="299">
between them. The ladies, who de&s;erve more &s;evere correction than their hu&s;bands, fathers, or other relations can properly admini&s;ter, are con|fined by the magi&s;trates for a term proportioned to their offence, in this royal man&s;ion of correction. The relation, at who&s;e &s;uit they are taken into cu&s;tody, pay three &s;ueldos, or four-pence halfpenny per day for their maintenance, and with this &s;canty provi&s;ion, they mu&s;t be contented. Here they are compelled to work, and the produce of their labour is depo&s;ited for them, till the time of their confine|ment is expired. The whole building will contain 5000 women; but when <HI>Town&s;end</HI> was there, there were only 113. Among the&s;e, are &s;ome ladies of condition, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be vi&s;iting &s;ome di&s;|tant friends. When it is judged nece&s;&s;ary, they re|ceive bodily correction for their reformation. Among other particulars, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> the governor who conducted me through the &s;everal apartments, informed me, they had then under di&s;cipline, a lady of fa&s;hion, accu&s;ed of drunkenne&s;s, and of being im|prudent in her conduct. As &s;he was a widow, the party accu&s;ing, was her brother in law, the Mar|quis.</P>
<P>No ho&s;pital that I have &s;een upon the continent, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> is &s;o well admini&s;tered, as the general ho&s;pital of this city. It is peculiar in its attention to
<PB N="296" REF="300">
convale&s;cents, for whom a &s;eparate habitation is provided, that after they are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;ick wards, as cured of their di&s;ea&s;es, they may have time to recruit their &s;trength, before they are turned out to endure their accu&s;tomed hard&s;hips, and to get their bread by labour. Nothing can be more u&s;eful, nothing more humane, than this appendage. The numbers received into this ho&s;pital, were, in the year 1785, upwards of 9,000, and in 1786, upwards of 6,000. In the former year, they buried upwards of 800, in the latter, upwards of 900; which, upon the average, is nearly a ninth of tho&s;e who enter; but then it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that many are put into public ho&s;pitals, merely to &s;ave the expence of fu|nerals.</P>
<P>With this ho&s;pital, is united under the &s;ame ad|mini&s;tration, an e&s;tabli&s;hment for foundlings, &s;uffi|ciently capacious for the city and its environs. The de&s;erted children were above 500 on the average of 1785, and 1786, and of the&s;e, two thirds were bu|ried; a proportion, &s;hocking to humanity, but the inevitable con&s;equence of taking children from their mothers, and crowding them in a city, more e&s;peci|ally, if, as in Barcelona, five children hang upon one nur&s;e. It is much to be lamented, that they have not like the French, recour&s;e to the milk of goats,
<PB N="297" REF="301">
or like the nur&s;es of the orphan ho&s;pital in Dublin, learnt the u&s;e of &s;ucking bottles.</P>
<P>The boys on this foundation are bound apprentice when of a proper age; the girls, when marriageable, are conducted in proce&s;&s;ion through the &s;treets, and any young man who &s;ees one, whom he would like for a wife, is at liberty to mark her, which he does, by throwing his handkerchief to her.</P>
<P>Barcelona may be con&s;idered as divided either into di&s;tricts, or into pari&s;hes; the former being five, the latter eight, including the cathedral. In a circum|ference of four miles, it contains at pre&s;ent 10,000 hou&s;es, 20,000 families, and about 100,000 inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>The wealth which flows into Barcelona, is not con|fined within its walls, but helps to encrea&s;e the po|pulation of all the &s;urrounding villages, which in the compa&s;s of five leagues, are 105, all &s;ubject to its ju|ri&s;diction, and all partaking of that tranquillity, which ari&s;es from energy in a well con&s;tituted go|vernment.</P>
<P>The indu&s;try which every where appears in Ca|talonia, &s;eems to act with concentrated force in Bar|celona. Early and late, not only is the hammer heard upon the anvil, but every arti&s;t is &s;een bu&s;ily
<PB N="298" REF="302">
employed. The two chief trades here, are taylors and &s;hoe-makers, who are employed in cloathing the army not only in Spain, but over the whole em|pire.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the more con&s;iderable trades, are the &s;ilk-weavers, cutlers, gun&s;miths, armourers, bra|ziers, carpenters, cabinet-makers, turners, with fringe-makers and embroiderers. Here is al&s;o a foundery for cannon. The ingenuity of the Spani&s;h arti&s;ts, is allowed to exceed that of mo&s;t other coun|tries.</P>
<P>The manufactures have increa&s;ed with &s;uch rapi|dity, that the wages of labour for all kinds of arti|cles in the city and environs, have advanced to one &s;hilling and eight-pence a day, for which they work only &s;even hours. The&s;e gains, however, are not out of proportion to the value of provi&s;ions, as regulated by the magi&s;trates. Mutton is &s;old for 10 pence the pound, of 36 ounces; beef for &s;even-pence, and bread at pre&s;ent, for &s;even farthings the pound, of 12 ounces; lodging for a &s;mall family, co&s;ts about two guineas a year.</P>
<P>The commerce of Barcelona is con&s;iderable. It has no navigable river, and &s;eems to have been built in its pre&s;ent &s;ituation, only for the &s;ake of deriving
<PB N="299" REF="303">
protection from the high mountain which commands it. The ba&s;on is formed by a mole, and is &s;uffici|ently capacious, but there is only 12 feet water on the bar.</P>
<P>Brandy, wine, nuts, almonds, rai&s;ins, and cork, are &s;hipped at different places on the coa&s;t for the mer|chants, who re&s;ide in Barcelona. The price of the wines varies according to the &s;ea&s;on, the&s;e are of &s;everal &s;orts, the average price of which, including the Spani&s;h duties, is about 50 &s;hillings the hog&s;|head. When brandy is deare&s;t, it is &s;old duty free on board, Hollands proof at one &s;hilling and four-pence halfpenny the gallon, but &s;ometimes as low as ten-pence. <HI>Swinburne</HI> makes the annual exports of brandy, from one town in Catalonia, near Tarragon Reus, to amount to 20,000 pipes. Five pipes of wine, makes one of &s;trong brandy. Catalonia furni&s;hes 35,000 pipes of brandy, and 2,000 of wine, be&s;ides 30,000 bags of nuts, containing three bu&s;hels each, at 20 &s;hillings the bag. Of the above, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> about 4,000 pipes of brandy, and &s;ome &s;ilk, go to Guern&s;ey and Alderney, and the re&s;t to France, all to be &s;muggled into England.</P>
<P>About 1,000 ve&s;&s;els enter the port of Barcelona yearly, of which one half are Spani&s;h, 100 Engli&s;h, 120 French, and 60 are Danes.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="304">The imports be&s;ides corn, are about 8,000,000 weight of Newfoundland cod, &s;old at one gui|nea per hundred weight; beans from Holland for the poor people, and an inferior &s;ort from Africa, for the mules; &s;alted conger eel from Cornwall and Britany, &s;old at 40 or 50 &s;hillings per quintal; this is an unwhole&s;ome, lu&s;cious food, which they cook up with garlick and &s;pice; there are likewi&s;e imported Engli&s;h bale goods, and many other articles of luxury.</P>
<P>There are two other cities in this province, which, on account of their antiquity, it may not be ami&s;s ju&s;t to notice, Tarragon and Lerida.</P>
<P>Tarragon is one of the mo&s;t ancient cities in Spain, and &s;aid to have been built by the Phenici|ans, who gave it the name of Tarcon, of which the Latins made Tarraco. It gave its name to one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable parts of Spain, called by the Romans Tarraconen&s;is: the city was fortified by <HI>Scipio,</HI> who made it a place of defence again&s;t the Carthaginians.</P>
<P>This city, &s;ays <HI>Peyron,</HI> is the metropolis of Cata|lonia, and di&s;putes with <HI>Toledo</HI> the primacy of Spain. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;ee, is &s;aid to have been in the fir&s;t ages of the church; the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of arch|bi&s;hops
<PB N="301" REF="305">
was interrupted by the Moors, and re|mained &s;u&s;pended till the 11th century.</P>
<P>Tarragon, of all the cities in Spain, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> would give the mo&s;t agreeable employment to the antiquarian. Here he would admire the remains of an amphitheatre, of a theatre, of a circus, of the palace of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> of temples, and of an exten&s;ive aqueduct with fortifications, which although of a more recent date, are ancient.</P>
<P>The cathedral is worthy of attention for its va&s;t dimen&s;ions, the elegance of its gothic architecture, and a magnificent chapel, built with rich marble and ja&s;per, in honour of S. <HI>Thecla,</HI> tutelar &s;aint of the church.</P>
<P>This city contains about 8,000 inhabitants, but whenever the canal of Arragon &s;hall be navigable, the whole country will feel the influence of reviving commerce, and among other cities, this may regain its ancient population.</P>
<P>Trade is now confined to wine and brandy, but for home con&s;umption, they carry on a con&s;iderable fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>To protect the inhabitants from the incur&s;ions of
<PB N="302" REF="306">
the Moors, they have erected batteries. The&s;e are the more needful, becau&s;e the ancient fortifications are gone to ruin, and the Algerines have committed frequent depredations on the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Near this city, in a wood of pines and &s;hrubs is a monument that tradition has named the tomb of the <HI>Scipio's.</HI> They were the father and uncle of <HI>Scipio Africanus,</HI> both killed in Spain. This building is &s;mall, being about 19 feet &s;quare, and 28 high. In the front, facing the &s;ea, are the &s;tatues of two war|riors, in a mournful po&s;ture, roughly cut out of the &s;tones of the &s;epulchre, and much worn away by the &s;ea air. The in&s;cription is now &s;o much defaced, that it is difficult to trace it out.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Lerida is delightful, and the country in which it &s;tands, is one continued garden, covered with corn, with olive trees, and vines. For beauty, few places can exceed it, but from the abundance of water, it is far from being healthy. This city, called Ilerda by the Romans, was rendered famous by the di&s;tre&s;s to which <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> was reduced, when encamped in its neighbourhood. He had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a plain, &s;hut in between the rivers Cinga and Sicoris, and defended by a deep entrenchment, whil&s;t <HI>Petreius</HI> and <HI>Afranius, Pompey's</HI> Generals, were encamped on a hill between him
<PB N="303" REF="307">
and Ilerda. Between the hill and the city, is a plain with an eminence, which, if &s;eized, might be quickly fortified, and would cut off all communication with the city. For this, during five hours, they main|tained a doubtful conflict, but in the end, fortune declared in favour of <HI>Afranius</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> retreated to his camp. Whil&s;t revolving in his mind, how he &s;hould cover this di&s;grace, word was brought, that by the melting of the &s;now upon the moun|tains, his two bridges were broken down, that the country was laid under water, and that all commu|nication was cut off with the provinces, by which his army had been fed. The immediate con&s;equence was famine. It was upon the news of this di&s;tre&s;s, that <HI>Cicero</HI> left the city, and joined <HI>Pompey</HI> at Dyrra|chium.</P>
<P><HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> without lo&s;s of time, &s;et his men to work, and having made a &s;ufficient number of little boats, light and portable like tho&s;e he had &s;een in Britain; after a few days, &s;ent a party up the river in the night, who, with the&s;e boats, made good, their land|ing, and, having fortified a camp, &s;ecured his retreat.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Character, Manners, Dre&s;s, &amp;c. of Catalonia.</HEAD>
<P>THIS province is almo&s;t throughout extremely mountainous. The nature of the country appears to have great influence on that of the inhabitants, who are a hardy, active, indu&s;trious race, of a middle &s;ize, brown complexion, and &s;trong features; their limbs well knit together, and by education and practice, inured to the greate&s;t fatigues; there are few lame or di&s;torted per&s;ons, or beggars to be met with among them. Their mocos, or mule-boys, are &s;tout walkers; &s;ome of them have been known to go from Barcelona to Madrid, and back again, in nine days, which by the high road, is 600 miles.</P>
<P>The Catalonians are excellent for light infantry, on the forlorn hope, or for a <HI>coup de main:</HI> but though brave and indefatigable, they are aver&s;e to the &s;trict|ne&s;s of regular di&s;cipline, unle&s;s it be in their own national regiments. They cannot brook the
<PB N="308" REF="309">
thoughts of being menial &s;ervants in their own country; but will rather trudge it all over with a pedlar's pack on their &s;houlders, or run about upon errands, than be chief dome&s;tic in a Catalonian fa|mily. Far from home, they make excellent &s;er|vants, and mo&s;t of the principal hou&s;es in Madrid, have Catalonians at the head of their affairs. They are the general muleteers and cale&s;&s;ieros of Spain; are to be met with in every part of the king|dom; their hone&s;ty, &s;teadine&s;s, and &s;obriety, entitle them to the confidence of travellers, and their thir&s;t after lucre makes them bear with any hard&s;hips. With good words, they are always docile; but will not bear hard u&s;age, or opprobrious language.</P>
<P>The rigid parfimony of this people, appears in their &s;canty provi&s;ion for the day. When they carry their little ba&s;ket to the market, together with their beef and garden &s;tuff, they bring home two deniers worth of charcoal. This circum&s;tance is &s;o characteri&s;tic, that when they would reproach the rich mi&s;er for his penury, they &s;ay, that notwith|&s;tanding his opulence, he continues to &s;end to mar|ket for <HI>dos dineros de carbon.</HI> Twelve deniers mak|ing a penny.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of all their immunities, the ignominious prohibition of every weapon, even a knife, and an
<PB N="306" REF="310">
enormous load of taxes, have not been able to &s;tifle their independent &s;pirit, which breaks out upon the lea&s;t &s;tretch of arbitrary power; but within the&s;e four years, many of their ancient privileges have been gradually re&s;tored. Their taxation is &s;till very high. All trade is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed according to the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;uppo&s;ed to be tran&s;acted in the cour&s;e of the year, without regard either to lo&s;s or gain.</P>
<P>Till of late, the inhabitants of Catalonia dur&s;t not carry any knife, but in each public hou&s;e, there was one chained to the table, for the u&s;e of all comers. The good order maintained by the police, and vi|gilance of the thief-takers, &s;upply the place of defen|&s;ive weapons; robberies and murthers being &s;eldom heard of; the &s;treets of Barcelona may be walked over at all hours, provided the pa&s;&s;enger carries a light with him; without it, he is liable to be carried to pri&s;on by the patrol.</P>
<P>The minones, or thief-takers, are men of tru&s;t and con&s;ideration, and of approved courage; their dre&s;s is that of the miquelets, or mountaineers, who &s;o cruelly hara&s;&s;ed the French armies in the wars at the beginning of the pre&s;ent century. They wear their hair in a net; a broad &s;ilver-laced hat, &s;queezed flat, like tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h &s;ailors, hung on one
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="311">

<PB N="307" REF="312">
&s;ide of their head; an handkerchief loo&s;ely tied round the neck: a &s;hort, &s;triped wai&s;tcoat, and over it, a red jacket, with large &s;ilver buttons like bells dangling from it; a blue &s;hirt, bound with yellow tape, rolled &s;everal times round their wai&s;t, in which they carry their knife, handkerchief, &amp;c. Over this jacket, they wear two cro&s;s belts, one for an am|munition pouch, the other for their broad &s;word and pi&s;tols; on the left &s;houlder hangs a blue great coat, embroidered with white thread; their breeches are blue and white &s;triped; their &s;tockings rolled below their knee, and gartered with an enormous buckle and bunch of black ribbons, reach only down to the ankle, where they tie &s;everal rounds of blue fillet very tight, to keep on their packthread &s;andals, that &s;eem &s;carce to cover their toes.</P>
<P>The common dre&s;s of a Catalonian &s;ailor, or mule|teer, is brown, and the di&s;tinction mark by which they are known in Spain, is a red woolen cap, falling forwards, like that of the ancient Phrygians. The middling &s;ort of people and artificers, wear hats and dark cloaths, with a loo&s;e coat, carele&s;sly to&s;&s;ed over the &s;houlders. Their breeches are commonly black velvet; they have &s;eldom any &s;tockings, and &s;andals &s;upply the place of &s;hoes.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the women in general, is a black
<PB N="308" REF="313">
&s;ilk petticoat, over a little hoop, &s;hoes without heels, bare &s;houlders, and a black veil, &s;tiffened out with wire, &s;o as to arch out on each &s;ide of the head, &s;omething re&s;embling the hooded &s;erpent; and in Spain, Italy, and Africa, all the inhabitants bind them&s;elves up with &s;a&s;hes, as a preventative of rup|tures.</P>
<P>The mode of drinking in Catalonia, is &s;ingular: they hold a broad bottomed gla&s;s bottle, at arms length, and let the liquor &s;pout out of a long neck upon their tongue.</P>
<P>The devotion of the Catalonians &s;eems to be pretty much upon a par, with that of their neigh|bours in the &s;outhern provinces of France, and much le&s;s ardent than in the other parts of Spain; but they &s;till abound with &s;trange practices of religion, and local wor&s;hip. One very odd idea of theirs is, that on the fir&s;t of November, the eve of All Souls, they run about from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, to eat che&s;nuts, be|lieving that for every che&s;nut they &s;wallow, with proper faith and unction, they &s;hall deliver a &s;oul out of purgatory.</P>
<P>There are now but one or two churches at mo&s;t in each city that are allowed the privilege of protect|ing offenders, and murderers are excluded from the
<PB N="309" REF="314">
benefit of the &s;anctuary. The proceedings of the inqui&s;ition are grown very mild. If any per&s;on leads a &s;candalous life, or allows his tongue unwar|rantable liberties, he is &s;ummoned by the holy office, and privately admoni&s;hed; in ca&s;e of non-amend|ment, he is committed to pri&s;on. Once a year every family mu&s;t an&s;wer to that tribunal for their orthodoxy, and that of every &s;ervant they have, or they mu&s;t quit the country; hut the foreign pro|te&s;tant hou&s;es are pa&s;&s;ed over unnoticed; and peo|vided a foreigner does not make religion the &s;ubject of his di&s;cour&s;e, he may live at Barcelona in what manner he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>Every Jew that lands in Spain, mu&s;t declare him|&s;elf to be &s;uch at the inqui&s;ition; which immedi|ately appoints a familiar to attend him all the time he &s;tays on &s;hore, to whom he pays a pi&s;tole a day. Were he to neglect giving this information, he would be liable to be &s;eized. Yet, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> I have been a&s;&s;ured by per&s;ons of undoubted credit, that a Jew may travel <HI>incognito</HI> from Perpignan to Li&s;bon, and &s;leep every night at the hou&s;e of a Jew, being recommended from one to another, and that wherever a hou&s;e is remarkably decked out with images, relics, and lamps, and the owner noted for being the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic devotee of the pari&s;h, it is ten to one but the family are I&s;raelites at heart.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Kingdom of Valencia, which made part of the ancient Kingdom of Arragon.</HEAD>
<P>THE kingdom of Valencia, is about 60 leagues in extent from north to &s;outh; its greate&s;t breadth, however, does not exceed 25. It is bounded on the &s;outh and ea&s;t by the Mediterranean, on the we&s;t by New Ca&s;tile, and the kingdom of Murcia; and on the north by Catalonia and Arragon. It was for|merly inhabited by the Celtiberians, the Turdetani, the Lu&s;oni, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>This is one of the be&s;t watered provinces in Spain. There are no fewer than 35 rivers, all of which run ea&s;t or &s;outh-ea&s;t into the Mediterranean; it is al&s;o in proportion to its extent, one of the be&s;t peopled provinces; it contains &s;even principal cities, 64 great towns, and upwards of 1000 villages; has four &s;ea-ports, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which, is that of Alicant.</P>
<P>The air and climate of Valencia, would be highly
<PB N="312" REF="317">
beneficial to the Engli&s;h, in a variety of ca&s;es; more e&s;pecially for nervous, and hypocondriac di&s;orders, &s;hattered con&s;titutions, and for tho&s;e who &s;uffer ei|ther by a redundancy, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of bile. They would find the oranges and grapes mo&s;t powerful detergents; and every article of food, whether ani|mal or vegetable, being light and ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, the mo&s;t delicate &s;tomach would never feel oppre&s;&s;ed. In our i&s;land, the&s;e patients &s;uffer by humidity; but in Valencia, &s;uch is the dryne&s;s of the air, that &s;u|gar and &s;alt may con&s;tantly be expo&s;ed, without con|tracting the lea&s;t &s;ign of moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>Among the natural curio&s;ities in this province, the mo&s;t remarkable are the baths of Buzot, in the vicinity of Alicant. Their temperature is about 104 degrees of <HI>Fahrenheit's</HI> thermometer. Two or three &s;mall tumblers of this water prove &s;peedily and plea&s;antly cathartic. This part of the country is frequently &s;haken by &s;trong earthquakes.</P>
<P>Silk is certainly the mo&s;t con&s;iderable article pro|duced in the province of Valencia, being nearly equal to all the re&s;t together. The land in this fer|tile valley never re&s;ts, for no &s;ooner is one crop re|moved, than the farmer begins to prepare it for ano|ther. In September he &s;ows barley, which having reaped about the latter end of April, he immediately puts in maize, which comes off about the middle of
<PB N="313" REF="318">
September. In November he &s;ows wheat, and in June reaps it. The produce both of wheat and barley, is from 15 to 24 for one, having &s;own of the former nearly two bu&s;hels, and of the latter, between three and four to an acre. Flax is put into the ground about September, and comes off in May; but hemp &s;owed in April, continues till Augu&s;t. The&s;e, with cucumbers, melons, peas, French beans, lettuce, form a rich variety of crops, which, che|ri&s;hed by a bright &s;un, and fed by abundant &s;treams, prove a never failing &s;ource of plenty.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring they abound with oranges and lemons; in &s;ummer they have plums, cherries, figs apricots, and nectarines; in autumn they gather grapes; and in winter, a rich variety of fruits &s;up|plies their tables. Thus <HI>Ceres</HI> and <HI>Pomona</HI> appear to be enjoyed in a never cea&s;ing conte&s;t, which &s;hall mo&s;t contribute to the wealth and pro&s;perity of this favoured valley.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t valuable productions of the coun|try, is the barilla. This is a vegetable peculiar to the kingdoms of Valencia and Murcia; it is e&s;&s;en|tial in the making of gla&s;s. About 150,000 quin|tals are gathered of it every year, mo&s;t of which is &s;ent to France and England, and a &s;mall quantity to Genoa and Venice.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="319">There is another &s;pecies of barilla, called in Eng|li&s;h, pot-a&s;h, employed in the &s;oap manufactures of France and England, a con&s;iderable quantity of which, is exported from the kingdom of Valencia.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e voracious in&s;ects, the locu&s;ts, occa&s;ionally commit great deva&s;tations in this part of Spain; and this proceeds not merely from the warmth of the climate, but for want of cultivation, becau&s;e the fe|males never depo&s;it their eggs in arable land, but al|ways in de&s;erts. For this rea&s;on Galicia, where agriculture prevails, is little infe&s;ted with the locu&s;t.</P>
<P>When the provincial governors are informed in &s;pring, that locu&s;ts have been &s;een, they collect the &s;oldiers and the pea&s;ants, divide them into compa|nies, and &s;urround the di&s;trict. Every man is fur|ni&s;hed with a long broom, with which he &s;trikes the ground, and thus drives the young locu&s;ts towards a common centre, where a va&s;t excavation, with a quan|tity of bru&s;h wood, is prepared for their reception, and where the flame de&s;troys them.</P>
<P>In the year 1780, 3,000 men were thus employed at Zamora for three weeks; and it was reckoned, that the quantity collected, exceeded 10,000 bu&s;hels.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Cities, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal cities in this fine province, termed the garden of Spain, are Valencia, Morvie|dro, and Alicant.</P>
<P>Valencia is one of the large&s;t cities in Spain, its &s;ituation is delightful, and the country round it a perfect garden, watered by the Guadalaviar, on the banks of which, the city &s;tands, at the di&s;tance of about half a league from the &s;ea. There are five hand&s;ome &s;tone bridges, built over the river, three of which have each 10 arches, another has nine, and the la&s;t has 13. Without the gates, are the college of Pope <HI>Pius</HI> V. and the palaces of the Viceroy, though this title is now altered to that of Captain-general. The <HI>Alameda,</HI> or Mall, re&s;embles that of St. James's Park, but is much more beautiful, on account of the trees, which are palms, cypre&s;s, elms, and mulberry trees intermixed, of which there are four double rows, forming three walks or alleys. There are many delightful walks along the river &s;ide,
<PB N="316" REF="321">
faced with &s;tone, the better to re&s;i&s;t the force of the water in winter. This city is walled, and has four gates. The hou&s;es are all numbered, as with us, and the names of the &s;treets painted on tiles on the corner hou&s;es. Its ancient name is unknown, but it is &s;aid to have been taken and fortified by <HI>Scipio,</HI> de&s;troyed by <HI>Pompey,</HI> and rebuilt by <HI>Sertorius.</HI> It was taken from the Romans by the Goths, and from the&s;e latter by the Moors, who, at two different pe|riods, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it 240 years, but in 1238, it was fi|nally conquered by the King of Arragon.</P>
<P>The &s;treets of Valencia are narrow, crooked, un|paved, and impa&s;&s;able after rain; and in the&s;e, there are but two or three hou&s;es built with ta&s;te, and a few churches di&s;tingui&s;hed by their architecture. In a word, it is a city built by the Moors, who, a&s;&s;o|ciating &s;eldom with each other, and &s;hut up with their women, con&s;idered &s;treets as nothing more than nece&s;&s;ary paths, and gave their whole attention to the interior of their hou&s;es, which were airy and &s;pacious, but in general inconvenient and badly di&s;|tributed.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es are filthy, ill built, and ruinous; mo&s;t of the churches are tawdry, and loaded with barba|rous ornaments, both without and within. In the multitude of &s;acred edifices, &s;ome may be found that excel in particular parts, as one may plea&s;e the
<PB N="317" REF="322">
eye by the ju&s;t proportion of its dimen&s;ions, another &s;trike by the richne&s;s of its marble and paintings; but in all of them, the judicious ob&s;erver will be di&s;|gu&s;ted with loads of garlands, pyramids, broken pediments, and mon&s;trous cornices. Some churches have domes, but the greater part of them tall and &s;lender turrets, painted and bedecked with all &s;orts of pila&s;ters and whim&s;ical devices; every thing is likewi&s;e gilt and bedaubed with incredible profu|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Prie&s;ts, nuns, and friars of every dre&s;s and deno|mination, &s;warm in this city, where &s;ome convents have more than 100 monks all richly provided for.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity of Valencia is a re&s;pectable com|munity; it was founded in 1411, and &s;oon after its in&s;titution, <HI>Alon&s;o</HI> III. of Arragon, granted the pri|vilege of nobility to all the &s;tudents who &s;hould gra|duate in law. It was lately much on the decline, but they now reckon 2,400 &s;tudents. There are 20 profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the library of the univer&s;ity, which con|tains many thou&s;and volumes, mo&s;tly modern and well cho&s;en; four galleries in the Archbi&s;hop's pa|lace are devoted to the u&s;e of the &s;tudents, and con|tain
<PB N="318" REF="323">
32,000 volumes, among which are many mo|dern publications in every branch of &s;cience.</P>
<P>In traver&s;ing the city, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> to view whatever was mo&s;t worthy of attention, con&s;idering its flouri&s;hing condition, and the opulence of its ci|tizens, whether merchants, manufacturers, eccle&s;ia&s;|tics, the military, or gentlemen of landed property, I was &s;truck with the &s;ight of poverty, wretchedne&s;s, and rags in every &s;treet. The ho&s;picio, or general workhou&s;e, provides for 220 men, 150 boys, 280 women, and 90 girls, who are all well fed, well clothed, and well lodged; yet the city &s;warms with &s;turdy beggars. I &s;u&s;pected, however, what I found to be the ca&s;e, that the eccle&s;ia&s;tics di&s;tribute mo|ney, and yet the convents give bread and broth every day to all tho&s;e who make application at their gates. This circum&s;tance will &s;ufficiently account for the multitude of mi&s;erable objects, who, in Valencia, as in all other places, bear exact proportion to the un|di&s;tingui&s;hing benevolence of wealth.</P>
<P>One e&s;tabli&s;hment de&s;erves the highe&s;t commen|dation; it is a <HI>monte pio,</HI> or bank for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of farmers, who are unable to purcha&s;e &s;eed. For this loan they pay no intere&s;t, the funds being fur|ni&s;hed from the effects of Metropolitans, decea&s;ed, and from vacant benefices. From the &s;ame funds in Galicia, fi&s;hermen are provided with boats and nets.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="324">No city in Spain, pays more attention to the arts, than the city of Valencia. The public academy for painting, &s;tatuary, and architecture, is well attended, and many of the pupils &s;eem ri&s;ing to eminence. To have good de&s;igners, is of the greate&s;t impor|tance to their manufactures of &s;ilk, porcelaine, and painted tiles.</P>
<P>The &s;ilk manufacture is the mo&s;t important, be|cau&s;e the mo&s;t natural to their &s;oil and climate. This trade is &s;till increa&s;ing, and they have now 5000 &s;ilk looms, and 300 &s;tocking frames. Their &s;ilk is 30 <HI>per cent</HI> cheaper than it is in France, yet they are not able to meet their rivals fairly in the market.</P>
<P>At Alcora, in the neighbourhood of Valencia, is a manufacture of porcelaine, e&s;tabli&s;hed by Count <HI>d'Aranda,</HI> which de&s;erves encouragement. Their imitation of gilding is very plea&s;ing and natural, and after many years trial, has been found to be dur|able.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> I was mo&s;t delighted with the manufacture of painted tiles. In Valencia, their be&s;t apartments are floored with the&s;e, and are re|markable for neatne&s;s, coolne&s;s, and elegance. They are &s;tronger and much more beautiful than tho&s;e we formerly received from Holland.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="325">The commerce of Valencia is con&s;iderable. The <HI>Abb&eacute; Cavanilleo,</HI> &s;tates the produce of this fertile province in 1770, to have been near 3,000,000 &s;ter|ling. In this account, I am inclined to think, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;hend,</HI> the brandy is omitted, of which there are commonly &s;even or 3,000 pipes exported annually, mo&s;t of which comes to us, through Guern&s;ey, as French brandy.</P>
<P>The manufactures of &s;ilk, are the cau&s;e of a popu|lation in this province, that may be reckoned con&s;i|derable, if compared with the other provinces of Spain; it being computed that there are nearly 1,000,000 of inhabitants re&s;ident in 570 towns and villages, of which this province con&s;i&s;ts. Of this number, the city of Valencia alone, is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain 100,000.</P>
<P>The road from Valencia to Xativa, the ancient Soetabis, is bordered on each &s;ide with &s;mall canals of running water, like tho&s;e in the plains of Lom|bardy. The di&s;tance from Valencia to this latter city, is nine leagues. The whole country has the appearance of one continued garden. Here are many rice fields, which are always kept about three inches under water. The mulberry trees in the&s;e fields, are planted chequer-wi&s;e. This delightful country is &s;urrounded partly by high mountains, (on which are many Moori&s;h ca&s;tles,) and partly by the
<PB REF="326">
Mediterranean &s;ea. The country is &s;o populous, that the towns and villages are not above half a league a&s;under, where may be &s;een crowds of wo|men and children, &s;itting at the doors of their re|&s;pective habitations, occupied in &s;pinning &s;ilk.</P>
<P>Morviedro, which lies about four leagues north of Valencia, is the famous Saguntum, de&s;troyed by <HI>Hannibal,</HI> for its fidelity to the Romans. The Ro|mans afterwards rebuilt this city, but never could re|&s;tore it to its former &s;plendor.</P>
<P>The city of Morviedro, is full of the remains of its antiquity; the walls of the hou&s;es, the city gates, and doors of the churches and inns, are covered with Roman in&s;criptions.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, it is a con&s;iderable city, containing above 5,000 inhabitants, who are &s;trangers to manu|factures, and depend altogether for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, on the produce of the &s;oil. The commerce of this city is chiefly in oil, rai&s;ins, wine, and brandy.</P>
<P>Its mo&s;t curious monuments are the ca&s;tle and the theatre, the former contains heaps of ruins, the monuments of &s;everal centuries, and are at pre&s;ent upwards of a quarter of a league in extent. Mo&s;t of the towers and edifices, of which the remains only are now to be &s;een, appear to have been con|&s;tructed
<PB N="322" REF="327">
by the Moors, with the materials left them by the Romans.</P>
<P>The theatre, va&s;t in its dimen&s;ion, and capable of receiving near 10,000 per&s;ons, is hewn out of the rock, and commands a mo&s;t exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of the &s;ubjacent country, which is bounded by the &s;ea. It is &s;ufficiently well pre&s;erved, plainly to di&s;|tingui&s;h the order in which the &s;pectators were di&s;|tributed at their dramatic repre&s;entions. At the bottom in the place of our orche&s;tra, are the &s;eats for the magi&s;trates; next tho&s;e for the eque&s;trian order, and la&s;t of all, tho&s;e for the body of the peo|ple. As this theatre is built on the declivity of a mountain, the ground ri&s;es with the benches, &s;o that on which ever &s;ide the people entered, they found them&s;elves almo&s;t on a level with the place they were to occupy. Tho&s;e of the lictors and courtezans, are &s;till in good pre&s;ervation, and the &s;emicircular roof of the whole edifice is entire. What &s;eemed to me, &s;ays <HI>Peyron,</HI> &s;carcely credible was, that the actors &s;hould in the open air have been able to make them|&s;elves heard by &s;o numerous an audience. To a&s;|&s;ure my&s;elf of the fact, I placed a boy where the &s;tage formerly was, and whil&s;t I remained at the top of the amphitheatre, made him repeat phra&s;es, of which I lo&s;t not a word. The front of the ancient &s;tage, which in our modern theatres may be com|pared to the &s;pace in which the foot-lights are
<PB N="323" REF="328">
placed, has been converted into an alley of mulberry trees, and ropes are now made on that ground, where formerly the ver&s;es of <HI>Terence</HI> were recited to a Ro|man audience.</P>
<P>From the theatre of Saguntum, we climb, rather than walk up to the ancient fortre&s;&s;es of the Moors; upon the platform, on a &s;ummit, is a humble hermi|tage, the inhabitants of which enjoys one of the fine&s;t pro&s;pects in Spain.</P>
<P>From hence to Valencia is one perfect garden, &s;o thick with trees, that there is no &s;eeing at any di&s;|tance on either &s;ide. Villages and mona&s;teries every hundred yards, and &s;uch crowds of people as are &s;carce to be met with, but in the neighbourhood of London. All the grounds are divided into water channels, the work of the Moors, who under&s;tood the art of watering land to the utmo&s;t perfection. The ruinous &s;tate that the&s;e drains are now in, prove the indolence and inferiority of the pre&s;ent proprie|tors; what little &s;kill they &s;till &s;hew in agriculture, being nothing but traditional remains of the in&s;truc|tions left by their great ma&s;ters in hu&s;bandry, the Arabians.</P>
<P>Alicant is a &s;ea-port on the Mediterranean, of great trade, protected by a &s;trong ca&s;tle, &s;ituated on a rock about 20 leagues &s;outh of Valencia, and as
<PB N="324" REF="329">
many to the north of Carthagena. One of the cir|cum&s;tances which has mo&s;t contributed to the riches and commerce of Alicant, is the duties of entry be|ing le&s;s there, than at either of the above cities.</P>
<P>Within four leagues of the city, there is a kind of re&s;ervoir, or ci&s;tern, between two mountains, called <HI>El Pantano,</HI> in which the water that falls from all the neighbouring mountains is received, and which, in ca&s;e of a want of rain, &s;erves to &s;upply the whole di&s;trict for a year. The walls of the ba&s;on are 200 feet high, and at the ba&s;e, upwards of 40 feet thick.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of the whole country between Alicant and Guardamar, is entirely &s;aline. The &s;alt pits here have been famous in hi&s;tory for the&s;e 2,000 years.</P>
<P>The waters of Bou&s;&s;ot, a village within a few leagues of Alicant, are &s;aid to be of u&s;e in ob&s;truc|tions and venereal ca&s;es; people go to drink them in the month of May, but they find there no kind of lodging, and the &s;ick who remain, are obliged to have &s;mall tenements erected for their accommoda|tion. The ro&s;emary plant thrives &s;o well in this neighbourhood, that it frequently grows to the height of &s;ix feet.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="330">Alicant is &s;ituated at the bottom of a bay, formed by the capes La Huerta, and San Pablo. The &s;treets are narrow, and were exceedingly ill-paved; but now, indebted to the indefatigable zeal of the Governor Don <HI>Franci&s;co Pacheco,</HI> few towns can boa&s;t of &s;uperior neatne&s;s; and this city, formerly in every &s;en&s;e a ne&s;t of vermin, is become a delight|ful re&s;idence. The inhabitants are in number about 18,000.</P>
<P>Neither the churches nor any of the convents are worthy to be noticed. In the great church, indeed, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> I was much amu&s;ed, but not with the architecture, nor yet with any of the altars; for that which caught my attention, was a grant from the college of Cardinals, of 2580 days indulgence to any penitent, who &s;hall &s;ay before the altar of the Virgin, <HI>ave Maria puri&s;&s;ima,</HI> and of as many to all who hear|ing this &s;hall an&s;wer, <HI>Sin peceada concebida.</HI></P>
<P>On the &s;ummit of a rocky mountain, ri&s;ing ju&s;t behind the town, is the ca&s;tle, now fortified after the modern method, and extended far beyond the limits of the old fortre&s;s, great part of which was blown up with a fragment of the rock, in the war with the al|lies, in the reign of Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> This fortre&s;s was then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, under the com|mand of General <HI>Richards.</HI> When the Spaniards had nearly fini&s;hed their work, they gave warning to

the garri&s;on, and when they had lodged in it 1300 barrels of powder, they generou&s;ly permitted the Engli&s;h General to &s;end his engineers, who viewed the mine with its contents. The&s;e reported that the burthen was too great for the quantity of powder, and that the garri&s;on was &s;afe.</P>
<P>On the day appointed for the &s;pringing of this mine, people from every part of the country a&s;|&s;embled on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide to view the cata&s;trophe, and notice of the fatal moment was given to the gar|ri&s;on. Preci&s;ely at that moment, the officers en|gaged in drinking, and &s;omewhat elated by their wine, declared their re&s;olution not to quit the battery, till they had drank two bottles more, for which they had &s;ent a &s;ervant; but no &s;ooner had he turned his back, than the battery, together with General <HI>Rich|ards,</HI> and 20 gallant officers, mounted in the air.</P>
<P>In this city there is an in&s;titution, likely to be of exten&s;ive utility, in providing for orphans, and the &s;ons of &s;oldiers burthened with numerous fami|lies. It is a military academy, in which they are taught reading, writing, and accounts, the manual exerci&s;e and every thing needful to qualify them for &s;erjeants. Indeed, the military e&s;tabli&s;hments of every kind in this country, appear re&s;pectable, and mark at once wi&s;dom and humanity in all their re|gulations. The &s;oldiers are enli&s;ted for eight years,
<PB N="327" REF="334">
during which, they are indulged with frequent fur|loughs. When they have &s;erved 15 years, their pay goes on gradually increa&s;ing, and after 35 years, they retire with the rank of commi&s;&s;ioned officers, and a pen&s;ion of about 20 pounds a year.</P>
<P>In &s;crambling along the rocks, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> I ob&s;erved a track very &s;trongly marked, leading to a part of the fort where the walls are low. This being at once the &s;teepe&s;t and mo&s;t rugged &s;ide of the mountain, it &s;urprized me much. On my return, I enquired into the nature and u&s;e of &s;uch a &s;eque&s;|tered way, and this was the re&s;ult of my enquiries.</P>

popular,</HI> that in Spain, many per&s;ons of quality are &s;hut up in pri&s;on for the&s;e and &s;imilar offences. He &s;tates, however, not much to the honour of the Spani&s;h ladies, that their accu&s;ations are not always ju&s;t. From him we may collect that a great number of the&s;e fair ones, per&s;uaded by their Cortejos, fal&s;ely charge their hu&s;bands with ill-treatment, whenever the good men &s;hew a di&s;po&s;ition to be jealous.</P>
<P>Some young men of fa&s;hion, at the reque&s;t of their fathers or wives, are, as the Governor informed me, de&s;tined to pa&s;s their tedious hours in this ca&s;tle. Yet, by the connivance of the centinels, they are fre|quently in the du&s;k of the evening, permitted to &s;cale the walls; when pa&s;&s;ing di&s;gui&s;ed into the city, they amu&s;e them&s;elves among their friends, till the company retires: after which, they return by the &s;ame &s;olitary path, to their de&s;tined habitations; and this was preci&s;ely the path, which had attracted my attention.</P>
<P>In a conver&s;ation with the Governor, &s;ays the above writer, on a mode of puni&s;hment long &s;ince inflicted in France and Spain, and lately adopted in our i&s;land, that of employing criminals on public works; he perfectly agreed with me, that their la|bour is &s;carcely worth a tenth of what is expended on them; and he further a&s;&s;ured me, that as far as his ob&s;ervation went, this puni&s;hment rather tended to
<PB N="329" REF="336">
harden them in wickedne&s;s, than produce a refor|mation in their manners. He particularly men|tioned, that of about 5000 convicts bani&s;hed to the garri&s;on of Africa, the major part on their di&s;|charge, at the expiration of their terms, returned to the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the penin&s;ula, and to this cir|cum&s;tance he attributed the prevalence of the mo&s;t atrocious crimes in that part of Spain.</P>
<P>The commerce of Alicant con&s;i&s;ts in barilla, an|timony, allum, ani&s;eed, cummin, and the wine &s;o much e&s;teemed in Europe, under the denomination of tent wine. The fine Alicant and tent wines, are made in a very beautiful vale near this city, &s;tudded with villages, villas, farms, and plantations of all kinds of fruit trees. Only two of the great number of proprietors of vineyards, make a practice of keep|ing their wines to a proper age. As the value is en|hanced many-fold by keeping; the high price they get for their wines, amply repays them for the time they are out of their money. Of the common &s;orts, about 5000 tuns may be the amount, mo&s;t of which is de&s;tined for the Bourdeaux merchants.</P>
<P>Water is the great agent, the primum mobile of all productions in this country; every thing lan|gui&s;hes, and &s;oon is parched up, without an ample &s;upply of it. Whenever a &s;pring breaks out, the king's people &s;eize upon it, and allot to each land|holder
<PB N="330" REF="337">
a proper hour for letting the water into his grounds. It is of &s;o much con&s;equence, that a gui|nea has been paid for an hour extraordinary.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the People, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE lower cla&s;s of men here, wear while linen wai&s;tcoats, trow&s;ers which reach to the knees, much re&s;embling the Highland fillebegs, with net hair caps, and &s;andals made of cord. The women have no caps, but plait their hair in a &s;piral figure, and fa&s;ten it with a large &s;ilver pin, in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e of Bologna and Naples.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this province, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> are &s;aid to have more of the filth, &s;ullen, and unpo|li&s;hed manners of the old Spaniards, and to have adopted le&s;s of foreign improvements in civilization, than mo&s;t other parts of Spain. They &s;trut about all day in mon&s;trous hats, and dark brown cloaks, which give the crowd in the &s;treets, the appearance
<PB N="331" REF="338">
of a funeral proce&s;&s;ion. Scarce any &s;ociety is kept up among&s;t them, though the &s;alubrity of the cli|mate and rea&s;ons of economy, induce &s;everal very con&s;iderable families to make this city (&s;peaking of Alicant) the place of their abode. In &s;ome &s;trange way or other, they &s;pend large incomes, without do|ing them&s;elves the lea&s;t credit. Their chief ex|pence lies in &s;ervants, mules, and equipages; low ob&s;cene amours, often con&s;ume the be&s;t part of their fortunes; and they live in &s;o pitiful a manner, that mo&s;t of them &s;end to the wine vaults for a pint of wine to their meals.</P>
<P><HI>Swinburne's</HI> interview with the old Intendant of this province, and the anecdote of his hardne&s;s of heart, &s;eem much of a piece with their general cha|racter. Our fir&s;t morning at Valencia, &s;ays he, pa&s;&s;ed very &s;trangely in a vi&s;it to the Intendant, to whom we brought a letter of recommendation from his <HI>confrere</HI> in Catalonia. The old u&s;urer, who&s;e fi|gure re&s;embled that of the bandy legged apothecary in <HI>Hogarth's Marriage a la mode,</HI> received us very ungraciou&s;ly, took our letter and flung it on the table, without &s;aying a &s;ingle &s;yllable to us, or even offering us a &s;eat. Having waited for &s;ome time, we looked at each other, and could not help &s;miling. Upon this, the Intendant looked up, and a&s;ked," if we were not Catalonians?" "No, (replied I) we are Engli&s;h gentlemen on our travels." This an|&s;wer
<PB N="332" REF="339">
produced a wonderful effect. "Oh, oh, you come from a better country! Can I be of any u&s;e to you? Bring the&s;e gentlemen chairs&mdash;do you choo&s;e to take any refre&s;hment, &s;aid he, pulling off his hat, and making us a profound bow?" "We told him, the only thing we &s;tood in need of, was protection again&s;t the people of the cu&s;toms, who were continually pe&s;tering us for money to drink, or to buy tobacco with.</P>
<P>The Valencian, &s;ays <HI>Peyron,</HI> is &s;ubtle, fal&s;e, and mild in his manners; he is the mo&s;t idle, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t &s;upple individual that exi&s;ts. All the tumblers and mountebanks of Spain come from the kingdom of Valencia.</P>
<P>The lower cla&s;s of people in this province, are remarkable for their great &s;uper&s;tition. The coach|men and mule drivers, carry con&s;tantly about with them the paw of a mole, to &s;ecure their mules and hor&s;es again&s;t the <HI>mal de oios.</HI> This, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> I conceived at fir&s;t to be the di&s;ea&s;es of the eye; but upon more accurate enquiry, found my&s;elf mi&s;taken, and di&s;covered that this expre&s;&s;ion meant the evil influence of witchcraft, conveyed by looks. In the &s;outhern provinces of Spain, as formerly throughout England, and even now in Cornwall, children and common people univer&s;ally agree in attributing ne|cromantic powers to the female in each village,
<PB N="333" REF="340">
who is the mo&s;t deformed in per&s;on, the mo&s;t de|crepit with old age, and the mo&s;t hagged in her looks. In Cornwall, it is nece&s;&s;ary for the witch to repeat thrice, "I wi&s;h," but in Spain, one look con|veys the fatal influence, and the object, unle&s;s re|lieved by a &s;uperior power, may droop and die. The proper amulets, are the paw of a mole, carried in the pocket, a bit of &s;carlet cloth worn by men, or the <HI>mane&s;ita</HI> fa&s;tened on the wri&s;t of children. The <HI>mane&s;ita</HI> is a little hand of jet, ivory, gla&s;s, or &s;tones, &s;et in &s;ilver with the thumb, thru&s;t out be|tween the middle fingers. But for want of the&s;e, a per&s;on apprehending danger, may immediately defend him&s;elf by the &s;ame po&s;ition of his thumb. For this rea&s;on, whenever the fond mother ob&s;erves an ugly hag looking &s;tedfa&s;tly upon her child, &s;he &s;creams out <HI>fe&s;ta una &s;iga,</HI> that is, thru&s;t out the thumb, in token of defiance. This kind of &s;uper|&s;tition is by no means novel; it may be traced as far back as the Romans.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t prevalent di&s;ea&s;e in this part of Spain, is the intermittent fever, ari&s;ing here not from mar&s;h mia&s;mata, but from the quantity of melons which the pea&s;ants eat, and from their hard labour, when expo&s;ed to the &s;corching &s;un.</P>
<P>It is happy for the people they have another &s;ource of hope, under the various di&s;ea&s;es incident to the
<PB N="384" REF="341">
human frame, be&s;ides the &s;kill of their phy&s;icians, a &s;ource of hope that never fails them at any &s;ea&s;on of di&s;tre&s;s. Thus for in&s;tance, St. <HI>Anthony</HI> the <HI>Abbot,</HI> &s;ecures his votaries from fire; and St. <HI>Anthony</HI> of <HI>Padua,</HI> delivers them from water; St. <HI>Barbara</HI> is the refuge of the timid, in times of thunder and war; St. <HI>Bla&s;o</HI> cures di&s;orders of the throat; St. <HI>Lucia</HI> heals all di&s;ea&s;es of the eyes; St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> is the pa|tron of young women who de&s;ire to be married; St. <HI>Ramon</HI> is their powerful protector during preg|nancy; and St. <HI>Lazaro</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ts them when in labour; St. <HI>Polonia</HI> pre&s;erves the teeth; St. <HI>Domingo</HI> cures the fever; and St. <HI>Roque</HI> is the &s;aint invoked under apprehen&s;ions of the plague. And thus, in all di&s;|ea&s;es, under every pre&s;&s;ure of affliction, &s;ome &s;aint is acce&s;&s;ible by prayer, who&s;e peculiar province it is to relieve the object of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The phy&s;icians in this part of Spain, are di&s;ciples of their favourite Doctor <HI>Piquer,</HI> who denied, or at lea&s;t doubted of the circulation of the blood. They have laboured under the greate&s;t di&s;advantages in their education, and want of encouragement when they entered upon practice, receiving little money, and le&s;s honour, in the way of their profe&s;&s;ion. In their medical cla&s;&s;es, they had no di&s;&s;ections, no ex|periments in chemi&s;try, and for botany, they were unacquainted with Linnaeus. The&s;e defects will now be remedied. But even in the pre&s;ent day, the
<PB N="335" REF="342">
fee of the phy&s;icians is very &s;mall, being only two-pence from the trade&s;man, ten-pence from the man of fa&s;hion, and nothing from the poor. Some of the noble families agree with a phy&s;ician by the year, paying him annually four-&s;core reals, that is, 16 &s;hillings for his attention on them and their fami|lies.</P>
<P>One thing very &s;ingular required of &s;urgeons and phy&s;icians in this country, before they enter on their profe&s;&s;ion, is, that they are obliged to &s;wear they will defend the immaculate conception of the virgin. This requi&s;ition is the more extraordinary, as that point is not univer&s;ally agreed on, even between Catholics them&s;elves. To give weight to the &s;anc|tion of an oath, every country &s;hould purge away tho&s;e which are become ob&s;olete, but more e&s;|pecially &s;uch as are univer&s;ally looked upon as ab|&s;urd.</P>
<P>In travelling through this province, &s;ays <HI>Swin|burne,</HI> we are obliged to carry not only our beds, but bread, wine, meat, oil, and even &s;alt; for nothing is to be met with in the inns, but bare walls, and perhaps a few eggs, &s;old at an uncon&s;cionable price. As much is a&s;ked for giving hou&s;e-room, as would pur|cha&s;e a &s;upper and good lodgings in the be&s;t inns of mo&s;t parts of Europe: the mildne&s;s of the cli|mate, however, obviates all inconveniencies accru|ing
<PB N="336" REF="343">
from a total want of gla&s;s, or even paper in the windows; or of a door or &s;hutter that can be fa&s;tened clo&s;e enough to keep out the wind or rain.</P>
<P>On arriving at one of the&s;e barns, called <HI>Ventas,</HI> our fir&s;t care is to &s;et up our beds. The kitchen is generally at one end; the mules &s;tand in the back part, and our apartment is a partition run up again&s;t the wall to the &s;treet, with a hole or two for lights.</P>
<P>Next our cook takes his &s;tand at the hearth to warm our broth, which we carry ready made, toge|ther with the kettle that &s;erves to heat it: if he can procure fuel and elbow room, he to&s;&s;es up a ha&s;h, or &s;ome &s;uch campaign di&s;h. Sometimes we are lucky enough to have an opportunity of &s;etting our &s;pit, or broiling a chop upon our gridiron, but the&s;e are luxuries not to be expected above once or twice in the cour&s;e of the week.</P>
<P>In this province, there is a new e&s;tabli&s;hment tak|ing place, which does much honor to Count <HI>Florida Blanca,</HI> as contributing not only to the ea&s;e and com|fort of the traveller, but likewi&s;e to the &s;afety of his per&s;on. Government is engaged in rai&s;ing at the di&s;tance of every league, a little cottage, with a &s;uit|able garden, as the habitation of a <HI>peon caminero,</HI> who is to receive five reals a day, for repairing the high|ways,
<PB N="337" REF="344">
and protecting pa&s;&s;engers. And for this pur|po&s;e, he is furni&s;hed with all proper implements and with arms. This in&s;titution is to be made general through all the provinces.</P>
<P>The government of Valencia is not di&s;tingui&s;hed from that of other provinces. The Captain General pre&s;ides in the civil, criminal, and military courts, and the Intendant has the &s;ole authority in matters of finance.</P>
<P>Taxes are heavy in Valencia. Every thing en|tering the city, even cloths made at Madrid, and &s;ilk for the manufacturers, and all commodities without di&s;tinction, pay eight per cent upon their value. But the province at large is free from &s;ome op|pre&s;&s;ive contributions, to which others continue &s;ubject, paying about 90,000 pounds, as an equi|valent for the provincial tents, purveyance and fo|rage for the army, with the royal monopolies of brandy and &s;alt. To this commutation, may in part be attributed the pro&s;perous condition of the whole kingdom of Valencia.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Province of Arragon.</HEAD>
<P>MOST of our modern travel writers, &s;eem to have pa&s;&s;ed by this province as not worthy of their notice. <HI>Town&s;end</HI> and <HI>Baretti</HI> are the only travel|lers of late date, who have given any account of it. Lying among the mountains, other travellers have entered Spain, or taken their departure thence along the &s;ea coa&s;ts, either through the kingdom of Na|varre, by the bay of Bi&s;cay, or by the province of Catalonia, on the Mediterranean &s;ide. Indeed, ex|cept the city of Sarago&s;&s;a, this province or kingdom appears to have little to attract the notice of a tra|veller.</P>
<P>It is bounded on the we&s;t by Navarre and Ca&s;tille, to the &s;outh by Valencia, to the ea&s;t by Catalonia; and to the north joins the Pyrenean mountains. Its extent from north to &s;outh, is about 160 miles; but from ea&s;t to we&s;t, it does not mea&s;ure above 100.</P>
<P>The river Ebro traver&s;es the country from north-we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t, &s;o as to divide it into nearly two
<PB N="339" REF="346">
equal parts. In its cour&s;e, it receives a number of le&s;&s;er &s;treams. This province is notwith&s;tanding dry and barren, and &s;ome parts of it even uninha|bited. The &s;oil is for the mo&s;t part &s;andy and &s;tony, and the country mountainous, &s;o that where the rivers do not come, or where water is not brought by art, it produces nothing. In tho&s;e parts, how|ever, that are well watered, there is corn, wine, oil, flax, fruits, and in &s;ome places &s;affron, which con&s;ti|tute the whole riches of the country.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Arragon was re-conquered from the Moors by its own inhabitants, before any of the other provinces. As no prince in Chri&s;tendom then laid claim to it, the Arragonians cho&s;e a king for them&s;elves. In&s;tead, however, of making a no|ble pre&s;ent of their kingdom to the man whom they fir&s;t rai&s;ed to the throne, the Arragonians impo&s;ed &s;uch conditions on him, as made it &s;carce worth his acceptance. One of the&s;e conditions was, that his authority &s;hould be controlled by a magi&s;trate, called <HI>El Ju&s;ticio,</HI> who, at his coronation, was to addre&s;s him in the&s;e words: <HI>Nos que valemos tanta como vos, os hazemos nece&s;tro rey y &s;enor, con tal que guardeis nue&s;tros fueros y libertades: &s;i no, no.</HI> i. e. 'We who think our&s;elves as good as you, choo&s;e you for our king and lord, on condition that you protect our laws and liberties. If not, we choo&s;e you not.' Little was the acquaintance of the ancient Arragonians with
<PB N="340" REF="347">
human nature, in flattering them&s;elves their kings would not &s;hew as much pride as they had done, when it was in their power. Accordingly, when the kings of Arragon became more firmly &s;eated in their throne, they forced their &s;ubjects to forbear their irreverential coronation &s;peech, which expo&s;ed them to the laughter of their &s;ubjects, in the very act of a&s;cending the throne, and made the will of the Ju&s;ticia &s;ub&s;ervient to their own. For &s;everal ages this magi&s;trate continued, notwith&s;tanding, to have con&s;iderable &s;way, but <HI>Philip</HI> II. contrived to de&s;troy it at one blow, on the following occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Philip,</HI> who was one of the proude&s;t and mo&s;t cruel men that ever di&s;graced human nature, had a &s;ecretary of &s;tate, called <HI>Antonio Perez.</HI> This <HI>Perez</HI> was ordered by <HI>Philip</HI> to put to death &s;ecretly an agent of his ba&s;tard brother <HI>John,</HI> Duke of Au&s;tria. Not knowing how to evade complying with this cruel order, <HI>Perez</HI> cau&s;ed the agent to be murdered by &s;ome ruffians in the &s;treets of Madrid.</P>
<P>The relations of the decea&s;ed, having di&s;covered that <HI>Perez</HI> was the perpetrator of this atrocious deed, had him thrown into pri&s;on, when his goods were confi&s;cated, and his arms di&s;located by the rack, without the king ever taking the lea&s;t notice of his &s;ufferings. He often expo&s;tulated with his
<PB N="341" REF="348">
maje&s;ty by letters, and had recour&s;e to his confe&s;&s;or to prevail on the king to take pity of his torments, and free him from his per&s;ecutors, which he could have done with a &s;ingle word, but it was all in vain. After many years impri&s;onment and torture, he found means to e&s;cape from his pri&s;on, and went to Sara|go&s;&s;a, where the Ju&s;ticia, well acquainted with his hi&s;tory, took him under his protection. The people of Sarago&s;&s;a, who knew that <HI>Perez</HI> had acted by the king's expre&s;s order, approved of the protection granted him by their chief magi&s;trate, and re&s;olved to &s;tand by him at all events. This exa&s;perated the proud monarch, who no longer di&s;&s;embling the black tran&s;actions, re&s;olved on the death both of <HI>Perez</HI> and the Ju&s;ticia, together with an annihila|tion of all the ancient privileges, of what he called his rebellious &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, he was able to carry his barbarous &s;cheme immediately into execution. He &s;ent an army into Arragon, too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted by a tumultuous populace. Sarago&s;&s;a was &s;oon taken, and the Ju&s;ticia fell into the king's hands, who had him executed in&s;tantly, without any proce&s;s, toge|ther with a con&s;iderable number of the ring-leaders.</P>
<P>Thus an end was put to the power of that magi&s;|trate, and the Arragonians deprived of their laws and liberties. They have now been near two cen|turies,
<PB N="342" REF="349">
as &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to their kings, as the re&s;t of the Spani&s;h &s;ubjects, and time, which obliterates all things, has at length utterly de&s;troyed the remem|brance of their <HI>fueros y libertades.</HI> As to <HI>Perez,</HI> he had the good fortune to e&s;cape into France, where he pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of his wretched life. In that country, he publi&s;hed &s;ome books, from which the whole of that cruel tran&s;action may be col|lected.</P>
<P>Sarago&s;&s;a is the capital of this province. The Phenicians, who were the founders of this city, call|ed it <HI>Salduba.</HI> But a Roman colony being &s;ent thi|ther by <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> gave it the name of <HI>Cae&s;area,</HI> or <HI>Cae&s;ar Augu&s;ta,</HI> of which its pre&s;ent name is a mani+fe&s;t corruption. This city &s;tands in the mid&s;t of a very fertile and delightful plain, on the river Ebro, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable river in Spain, which has here two bridges, one of &s;tone, the other of brick. The town is large and hand&s;ome, &s;everal of the &s;treets are &s;traight, long, and &s;pacious, e&s;pecially the one cal|led <HI>El Co&s;&s;o,</HI> where the nobility and gentry re&s;ort in their coaches on fine evenings, to take the air, one coach following the other &s;lowly up and down the &s;treet in proce&s;&s;ion. No town in this kingdom, ex|cept Madrid, abounds &s;o much in nobility and rich gentry, of whom about 400 it is &s;aid, keep their coaches.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="350">There are 17 large churches, with 14 &s;plendid convents, exclu&s;ive of le&s;&s;er ones. <HI>Baretti</HI> remarks, that it is the only city in Europe, which has two ca|thedrals. Here, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> I forgot all the hard&s;hips and fatigues we had &s;uffered on this long journey; nay, had I travelled all the way on foot, I would have freely done it, to enjoy the fight of the&s;e cathedrals. That which is called <HI>El Al&s;eu,</HI> is va&s;t, gloomy and magnificent; it excites devotion, in|&s;pires awe, and inclines the wor&s;hipper to fall pro&s;|trate and adore in &s;ilence the God who &s;eems to veil his glory; the other, called <HI>El Pilar,</HI> &s;pacious, lofty, light, elegant, and cheerful, in&s;pires hope, confi|dence, complacency, and makes the &s;oul impatient to expre&s;s its gratitude for benefits received.</P>
<P>In the centre of this cathedral, there is an edifice, &s;trikingly beautiful. The principal front is a chapel of our lady, who appeared upon this pillar to <HI>St. James,</HI> and afterwards gave him the image which is wor&s;hipped at her altar. This image is very &s;mall, but covered with a profu&s;ion of ornaments, and co&s;tly jewels. Over this there is a dome, cor|re&s;ponding to the great dome, under which it &s;tands, &s;erving by way of canopy to the image of the Virgin. The three other fronts of this elegant tabernacle, are, in like manner, chapels. Be&s;ides the great dome, there are many &s;maller domes &s;urrounding it, each with elegant paintings in compartments, the &s;ub|jects
<PB N="344" REF="351">
of which are hi&s;torical, taken from the &s;acred writings, or from the legends of the &s;aints, to whom the chapels and altars are dedicated.</P>
<P>The wealth of this cathedral is ine&s;timable, in &s;il|ver, gold, precious &s;tones, and rich embroidery, &s;ent by all the catholic &s;overeigns of Europe, to deck its prie&s;ts, and to adorn its altars. Many of the&s;e pre&s;ents being modern, are worthy of atten|tion for their elegance, as well as for the value of their pearls, diamonds, emeralds, and rubies. In a word, whatever wealth could command, or human art could execute, has been collected to excite the admiration of all who view the trea&s;ures of this church.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity contains near 2,000 &s;tudents, and for their in&s;truction, the doctors con&s;tantly re&s;iding, are 40, in theology; 20, for the canon law; 36, for civil law; 17, for medicine, and eight for arts. The foundation of this &s;eminary was laid in 1118, on the expul&s;ion of the Moors; but it was not incorpo|rated till 1474, and from that period it has been con&s;tantly cheri&s;hed and protected by the &s;overeigns of Arragon.</P>
<P>Near this city pa&s;&s;es the famous canal of Arragon, de&s;igned to form a communication by the Ebro, from &s;ea to &s;ea, between St. <HI>Ander</HI> in the Bay of Bi&s;cay
<PB N="345" REF="352">
and Torto&s;a, on the borders of the Mediterranean; a di&s;tance con&s;iderably more than 100 Spani&s;h leagues, or above 400 Engli&s;h miles. This per|haps, is one of the mo&s;t arduous undertakings that ever was conceived. To make the communication through this whole extent by water, is hardly po&s;&s;i|ble, or if po&s;&s;ible, is by no means de&s;irable; becau&s;e in pa&s;&s;ing the mountains of Bi&s;cay, which are a con|tinuation of the Pyrenees, only from Reino&s;a, at the head of the Ebro, to the Suanzes, which flows into the bay near St. <HI>Ander,</HI> in the &s;pace of three leagues, the fall is 3,000 Spani&s;h feet. The expence of this canal appears enormous; <HI>Town&s;end</HI> e&s;timates it at between eleven and 12,000 pounds per mile. About 50 miles appear to have been completed when he vi&s;ited this country, in 1787. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;ays he, I never &s;aw any &s;o beautiful or &s;o perfect in their kind, as the locks and wharfs; nor did I ever &s;ee men work with greater &s;pirit, or in a better manner. The number of men employed was 3,000, of which 2,000 were &s;oldiers, the others pea&s;ants. To the former they gave three reals a day, in addition to their pay, but they work mo&s;tly by the piece, and receive what they earn. The canals in Spain are nine feet deep, 20 feet wide at bottom, and 56 at top.</P>
<P>By means of the boats on the Ebro, there is at pre&s;ent an ea&s;y communication with the Mediter|ranean.
<PB N="346" REF="353">
The town, of cour&s;e, carries on no very in|con&s;iderable trade. The number of inhabitants is &s;aid to amount to little &s;hort of 60,000.</P>
<P>The cities having nothing further to attract the at|tention of our readers, we &s;hall now give &s;ome idea of the character of this people, as de&s;cribed by one of their ancient canons. In Sarago&s;&s;a, as in all other great towns, wicked people are not rare, but they are much more rare than at Madrid, and the great Sea|ports. The air of the court, is alas, pe&s;tilential to many; nor does that of the &s;ea, prove much better. And the rea&s;on is evident; but at court and at &s;ea|ports, men ride in a manner, on the whirlwinds of intere&s;t and ambition, which two pa&s;&s;ions are by our morali&s;ts aptly termed, <HI>los dos cuernos mas grandes del Demonio,</HI> 'the Devils two bigge&s;t horns,' but in our inland province, the greate&s;t part of the inhabitants are ru&s;tics, employed in the innocent occupations of the field, who, living by the product of uninterrupted labour, cannot be &s;o vicious as tho&s;e whom court favour or commerce often enriches with rapidity. Throughout this province, life is pa&s;&s;ed in the greate&s;t &s;implicity and uniformity. People gene|rally ri&s;e early, and continue their work the day through, with &s;carce any intermi&s;&s;ion. But as &s;oon as the &s;un is gone down, both &s;exes join every where to dance and &s;ing with &s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;m, that they
<PB N="347" REF="354">
appear, when beginning to grow warm, as if bereft of their &s;en&s;es; and this practice is &s;o general, not only in this, but in mo&s;t of our provinces, that were it po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee the whole kingdom at once, when day-light has di&s;appeared, much the greater part of its inhabitants would be &s;een bri&s;kly &s;haking their heels to the &s;ound of their in&s;truments and voices, old men and little children not excepted, provided they have but &s;ufficient vigour in their legs.</P>
<P>I know, &s;ays the venerable canon, that the French have long reproached us with pride and enmity to labour. They tell each other of the &s;words worn by our pea&s;ants, even when following the plough, and how &s;olicitous they are to &s;hew them, that they may be thought gentlemen. We are laughed at for hanging even the walls of our cottages with our ge|nealogies, and that our mo&s;t in&s;ignificant Hidalgos &s;hould think them&s;elves as nobly de&s;cended as the king. But it is not true that our low people hang their walls with their pedigrees; it is not true that our pea&s;ants wear &s;words; nor is it true that our Hidalgos of any cla&s;s, think them&s;elves as noble as the king.</P>
<P>As to our pretended aver&s;ion for labour, all will work who can, in the &s;ame proportion as the peo|ple of other countries. Should they cea&s;e to work, they would &s;oon &s;tarve, as our rivers run not with milk and honey, any more than the rivers of other
<PB N="348" REF="355">
countries. It may be objected, there are &s;pacious tracts of de&s;ert land in this province, but if tho&s;e lands lie uncultivated, the fault is not to be attri|buted to the inhabitants. How can we cultivate land where there is no water? water is the great pa|rent of vegetation; without it, both &s;un and land become nearly u&s;ele&s;s for the purpo&s;e of agricul|ture: but water cannot be created by men; and where we have none, the land mu&s;t lie ju&s;t as it is. This province abounds more in &s;treams than New Ca&s;tille, it is therefore more fertile. Catalonia is &s;till more &s;o than this province is, as the nearer we advance towards the &s;ea, the running &s;treams become more numerous, and have a &s;ufficient declivity to facilitate branching them out artificially, and &s;pread|ing them wherever it may be judged proper. Will it be concluded from &s;uch accidental circum|&s;tances, that the Catalans are more indu&s;trious than the Arragonians, or the Arragonians more ad|dicted to labour than the New Ca&s;tillians.</P>
<P>I repeat it again, adds this venerable Canon, that the Arragonians have as few vices, as any people on the earth. Gluttony and ebriety are words to which they annex the mo&s;t hateful ideas. They are not idle when they can avoid it; they are not &s;uch liars as the low people among the French; they are not addicted to &s;tealing, and have the reputation through|out Spain, of making the be&s;t &s;ervants: they are
<PB N="349" REF="356">
not quarrel&s;ome, but live in peace and affection with their neighbours. One proof of their not being vicious, is their early marriages. Nor do they &s;werve ea&s;ily from conjugal fidelity, when once bound in wedlock. Even the mule-drivers, who are ince&s;|&s;antly travelling to Madrid, are true to their wives, and it is their chief ambition to throw into their laps a piece of gold, earned by their journey, the moment they re-enter their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay that this character is applicable to all the lower cla&s;&s;es throughout the kingdom, and that &s;ome of the numberle&s;s <HI>arieros</HI> cannot get drunk, &s;wear profane oaths, and have &s;omething to &s;ay to every wench in the <HI>Po&s;adas.</HI> Tho&s;e of Valen|cia and Galicia are &s;aid to be very wicked, and as &s;uch, we &s;ee them often repre&s;ented upon our &s;tage. But allowance mu&s;t be always made for notions of this kind, which often have their &s;ource in preju|dice, pique, and other cau&s;es, not ea&s;ily traced to their origin.</P>
<P>The Galicians and Valencians &s;peak dialects &s;ounding very di&s;agreeably to the ears of the Ca&s;til|lians, and of us, &s;ays the Canon, who &s;peak nearly Ca&s;til|lian; and it has been remarked, that the difference in &s;peech, is often &s;ufficient to rai&s;e an antipathy between the &s;everal parts of a nation, and induce one to depreciate, cen&s;ure, and hate the other.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="357">Having now pretty fully de&s;cribed the cities, man|ners, and cu&s;toms of the different provinces, which formed part of the ancient kingdom of Arragon, we &s;hall enter upon tho&s;e which formerly made part of the kingdom of Ca&s;tille, beginning fir&s;t with the province of New Ca&s;tille, in which is Madrid, the pre&s;ent &s;eat of government, and the capital of the whole kingdom.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of the Province of New Ca&s;tille.</HEAD>
<P>CASTILLE is the principal and mo&s;t opulent kingdom in all Spain. It is generally divided into the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New;</HI> the former having been reco|vered from the Moors, long before the latter. New Ca&s;tille, of which in regard to the order of &s;ituation, we &s;hall &s;peak fir&s;t, is by &s;ome called al&s;o the king|dom of Toledo, being the centre of the monarchy, and the re&s;idence of the monarch. It is divided on
<PB N="351" REF="358">
the north by a chain of mountains from Old Ca&s;|tille, and a like chain divides it al&s;o ea&s;tward, from Arragon and Valencia. On this &s;ide it borders upon Murcia. To the &s;outh it is likewi&s;e &s;eparated by a chain of hills from Andalu&s;ia; and we&s;tward, bounded by E&s;tramadura. Its greate&s;t extent from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is about 180 miles, and its length from north to &s;outh, above 200. The Tagus, Guadiana, and Guadalquivir, have already been &s;aid to receive their &s;ources in this province. The fir&s;t two run from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t, quite through it, and greatly improve its natural fertility. The other ri|vers of note in this province, are the Xucar, which makes its way through Valencia into the Mediter|ranean; the Xarama, which falls into the Tagus and the Guadarama, which likewi&s;e lo&s;es it&s;elf in the &s;ame river below Toledo.</P>
<P>There is a cinnabar mine in the &s;outhern part of this province, which, according to <HI>Bowles,</HI> in his Natural Hi&s;tory of Spain, is the riche&s;t of the kind yet found, the mo&s;t curious for its properties, and one of the mo&s;t ancient that has ever been worked. The church, and a great part of the village of Al|madan, near which it is &s;ituated, and containing up|wards of 300 hou&s;es, were built from the produce of the cinnabar, and all the inhabitants &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the mine. The exhalation of the mercury is not dan|gerous to men, animals, or plants, as has generally
<PB N="352" REF="359">
been alledged; the galley-&s;laves &s;ent to work the mine, are robu&s;t and healthy, though &s;everal of them are wicked enough to feign being ill of the pal&s;y. Each of the&s;e &s;laves co&s;ts the &s;tate 20 pence a day, and there is not a labourer in Almaden, who has not offered to do more work for half the price. Five or 6,000 quintals of mercury are annually pro|duced from this mine, a part of which is u&s;ed in extracting &s;ilver from the mines of Mexico.</P>
<P>New Ca&s;tille was formerly governed by Earls, the la&s;t of whom dying without male i&s;&s;ue in 1029, be|queathed his dominions to his &s;i&s;ter, married to the King of Navarre, who rai&s;ed this province to a king|dom. <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> King of Leon, &s;ucceeded to it on the demi&s;e of <HI>Henry</HI> of Ca&s;tille, and in 1217, both kingdoms became united in his per&s;on; but the la&s;t and permanent union of the kingdoms of Ca&s;|tille and Arragon, was by the marriage of <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> Prince of Arragon, with <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> Queen of Ca&s;|tille.</P>
<P>Having now given a general view of this pro|vince, we &s;hall treat of its principal cities, which are Madrid and Toledo, together with the royal palaces, &s;ituated in the environs of the former, as likewi&s;e of the private life, manners, and cu&s;toms of the inha|bitants, and of whatever el&s;e we can find worthy of notice in the different writers, who have vi&s;ited Spain.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the City of Madrid.</HEAD>
<P>MADRID, the capital of the kingdom, was long only an ob&s;cure town, belonging to the Archbi&s;hops of Toledo; but while &s;o many flouri&s;hing and il|lu&s;trious cities, enjoying every advantage of &s;ituation, have &s;unk into de&s;erted villages, this town built in a &s;terile and ungrateful &s;oil, has become one of the fine&s;t cities in Europe.</P>
<P>On approaching Madrid, nothing announces to the traveller that he is near the capital of the Spa|ni&s;h monarchy. The inns within two leagues of this city, are equally dirty and de&s;titute of all conveni|ences, with tho&s;e in every other part of the king|dom. The &s;oil appears barren, and without either trees or verdure. But on arriving at the banks of the Manzanares, a magnificent &s;tone bridge, built by <HI>Philip</HI> II. notifies the vicinity of the royal re&s;idence. A French traveller has made him&s;elf very merry at the expence of this bridge, and cracked &s;ome je&s;ts on its di&s;proportion to the water that runs beneath.
<PB N="354" REF="362">
But Frenchmen, like other people, will ea&s;ily catch at opportunities of being cen&s;orious in foreign coun|tries. The fact is, that the Manzanares becomes at times a con&s;iderable river, by the &s;udden melting of the &s;now on the neighbouring hills, and is in winter often half a mile in breadth. <HI>Philip,</HI> therefore, acted very properly in building a &s;pacious bridge over it, and ridiculous are tho&s;e who pretend to ridicule him on this account. This &s;mall river, (the Manza|nares) &s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne,</HI> runs at &s;ome di&s;tance under the heights, upon which Madrid is &s;ituated. It is almo&s;t &s;hallow enough for carriages to ford over. It has, however, two great bridges, that of Segovia, and that of Toledo. It was of this latter, that among other wittici&s;ms, it was plea&s;antly &s;aid, <HI>that fine bridge only wanted a river.</HI> In pa&s;&s;ing through Spain, &s;e|veral others are met with, upon which the &s;ame ob|&s;ervations may be made, the rea&s;on of which is, that Spain is inter&s;ected in almo&s;t every direction, by long chains of mountains, who&s;e &s;ummits, not|with&s;tanding the heat of the climate, are frequently covered with &s;now. The rivulets and little rivers de&s;cending from their &s;ides, have u&s;ually but a &s;mall &s;tream of water, becau&s;e droughts are frequent in the provinces through which they run; but when abundant rains, or the melting of the &s;now increa&s;e their little &s;treams, their beds are more extended from their not being very deep, and carrying with them a large quantity of &s;and, and according to
<PB N="355" REF="363">
the&s;e circum&s;tances, although they do not often oc|cur, the dimen&s;ions of the bridges are calculated. They are &s;olidly con&s;tructed, owing to the impetu|ous torrents that occa&s;ionally come down, and their apparent di&s;proportionate length, is to obviate the evils which might ari&s;e from their overflowing.</P>
<P>This city &s;tands in the centre of a large plain, terminated on all &s;ides by mountains; it is &s;ituated in 13&deg; 49&prime; 30&Prime; longitude, of the i&s;le of Ferro, and 46&deg; 26&prime; latitude. The fir&s;t king that made any long abode in Madrid, was <HI>Henry</HI> IV. Before his reign, this was but an in&s;ignificant place, with a &s;mall ca&s;tle for the convenience of princes that came to hunt in the environs, which were then as woody as they are now naked. Its &s;ituation on a ri&s;ing ground, over|looking many leagues of country, open on every &s;ide to a whole&s;ome circulation of air, and abundance of good water, induced the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. to build an ample palace here, which he intended to make his chief re&s;idence, as he thought the climate be&s;t adapted to his con&s;titution. The &s;overeign once fixed at Madrid, the nobility &s;oon abandoned their hereditary ca&s;tles and hou&s;es in other cities, to follow the court.</P>
<P>If we except the royal palaces, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> there are few buildings worthy of attention, nor do I be|lieve there is in Europe a capital that has &s;o little to

&s;hew, as Madrid; having never been the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, it has of cour&s;e no cathedral, nor indeed any church, that di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf much from the com|mon herd of pari&s;hes and convents. Allowing &s;ome few exceptions, we may &s;afely pronounce the out|ward architecture of them to be barbarous, and their manner of ornamenting the in&s;ide, as bad as that of the wor&s;t ages; mo&s;t of them were erected or re|touched during the term of years that elap&s;ed be|tween the middle of the 17th century, and the year 1759, a period in the hi&s;tory of Spain, when all arts and &s;ciences were fallen to the lowe&s;t ebb of depra|vity; the effects of a total degeneracy of manners, and want of public &s;pirit. The&s;e vices in the poli|tical &s;y&s;tem of the three la&s;t princes of the Au&s;trian line, could not be immediately removed on the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of another family. The wars that &s;hook the very foundations of their throne, during the fir&s;t ten years of this century, kept all polite arts groveling in the du&s;t; and when they again rai&s;ed their heads, and ventured to court the favor of their &s;overeigns, there &s;eems to have been a total want of able profe&s;|&s;ors to &s;econd their efforts. No mad architect ever dreamed of a di&s;tortion of members &s;o capricious, of a twi&s;t of pillars, cornices and pediments &s;o wild and fanta&s;tic, but what a real &s;ample of it may be produced in &s;ome or other of the churches of Ma|drid. They are all &s;mall, and as poor in marbles, as they are in pictures. Their altars are piles of
<PB N="357" REF="365">
wooden ornaments, heaped up to the cieling, and &s;tuck round with wax lights, which more than once have &s;et fire to their churches. The convents, which may be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s any good pictures, are tho&s;e of St. <HI>Pa&s;qual,</HI> and the bare-footed Car|melite Nuns. The former has a fine <HI>Titian,</HI> a capi|tal <HI>Guerchino,</HI> and many other pictures by the mo&s;t e&s;teemed Italian ma&s;ters. In the &s;acri&s;ty of the latter, is a numerous collection of paintings, by va|rious hands, many of which are of &s;uperior merit. The tombs of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> VI. and his Queen <HI>Barbara,</HI> in the church of the vi&s;itation, are almo&s;t the only &s;epulchral monuments of any con&s;equence.</P>
<P>As to the churches in Madrid, &s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI> they are not in general &s;o magnificent, as one might ex|pect to find them in a country &s;o much renowned for the piety of its inhabitants. Mo&s;t of them are &s;trangely decorated with ornaments, not admitted into the churches of other countries. Their walls are frequently covered with &s;mall and trifling works of the pencil or chi&s;&s;el, hung up without any order or &s;ymmetry. In that which belongs to the <HI>Padres de la Merced,</HI> there is a large drawer, con|taining a variety of toys and baubles, the gifts of per|&s;ons repenting their attachment for trifles; and pre|&s;ented as an offering to a &s;mall waxen image of our Saviour in the drawer. Among&s;t other &s;ingulari|ties, is a large fragment of a plum-cake, pre&s;ented as
<PB N="358" REF="366">
they &s;ay, by a lady, who thought her&s;elf too fond of &s;weet-meats; and a mu&s;lin apron given by ano|ther, who caught her&s;elf in a fit of pride, the fir&s;t time &s;he put it on. The&s;e ladies fell upon this ex|pedient, to atone for their childi&s;h vanities.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t magnificent church in Madrid, is that of the Sale&s;ian Nuns. This church, with its fine convent, was built by Queen <HI>Barbara,</HI> remarkable for little el&s;e than her fondne&s;s for mu&s;ic, and her de|votion. This pa&s;&s;ion for mu&s;ic, cau&s;ed her to be&s;tow little &s;hort of 4,000 pounds a year, on the celebrated <HI>Farinelli,</HI> who was her chief favourite for many years, and to whom, among other things; &s;he bequeathed all her mu&s;ical in&s;truments, and one of the large&s;t collections of mu&s;ic, that was perhaps ever made. This is the only church in Madrid, in which the or|naments are not overloaded and childi&s;h. The altars, here, are not, as in the other churches, decked out with no&s;egays of natural and artificial flowers; nor are they hung round with little cages of canary birds, which keep &s;inging all day long, to the no &s;mall edi|fication of tho&s;e who go to hear ma&s;&s;es in the morn|ing, or to receive their benedictions in the evening. There are, however, many co&s;tly decorations in this church; the mo&s;t remarkable, exclu&s;ive of the royal monument, is a &s;ilver lamp, hanging by three long &s;ilver chains, which altogether, are &s;aid to weigh above 350 pounds. In the &s;acri&s;ty, are &s;ome
<PB N="359" REF="367">
&s;urplices of very fine Flanders lace, which are &s;up|po&s;ed to have co&s;t near 1000 pounds each.</P>
<P>The churches in Madrid, have neither pews, benches, nor chairs. Their floors are covered with &s;traw mats, upon which the men and women kneel promi&s;cuou&s;ly, without any di&s;tinction; whether they be grandees, or coblers, duche&s;&s;es, or wa&s;her-women. The men will often &s;tand during the ma&s;s, but the women &s;it negligently on their heels, hold|ing their ro&s;aries in their hands, and telling their beads in a whi&s;pering voice, and with a mo&s;t rapid motion of their lips.</P>
<P>At intervals, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> I walked about the town, to obtain &s;ome general idea of it, before I de&s;cended to particulars. In my own mind, I di|vided the whole into three portions, corre&s;ponding to three periods, ea&s;y to be di&s;tingui&s;hed. The mo&s;t ancient, is neare&s;t to the river Manzananes, with narrow and contracted &s;treets, crooked lanes, and blind alleys, like tho&s;e &s;till vi&s;ible in London, but more e&s;pecially in Paris, where no exten&s;ive con|flagration hath con&s;umed the rude monuments of art, erected by the remote progenitor, who inhabited the infant city. To the north and to the ea&s;t of this, as we remove further from the river, the &s;treets are wider, and the buildings affect &s;ome degree of &s;ymmetry. This portion, including the <HI>Plaza
<PB N="360" REF="368">
Mayor,</HI> or &s;quare, which, in its day, mu&s;t have been a &s;triking object, terminates at the <HI>Puerta del Sol.</HI> But when <HI>Philip</HI> II. removed his court, and Madrid became the capital of his va&s;t empire, the great no|bility erected palaces beyond the former limits, and the <HI>Puerta del Sol,</HI> is now the centre of the whole.</P>
<P>It is curious to trace the origin of cities. The &s;hepherd pitches his tent, or builds his mud-wall cottage by the river &s;ide, becau&s;e he cannot afford to &s;ink a well; but man, being a gregarious animal, others, for the comfort of &s;ociety, or mutual protec|tion, re&s;ort to the &s;ame &s;pot, and build as near to him as po&s;&s;ible. Cottages increa&s;e, tillage &s;ucceeds, manufactures follow, and the inhabitants advancing in number and wealth, wi&s;h to enlarge their habi|tations; but the ground being occupied, they have no other choice, but to rai&s;e their hou&s;es higher. Whil&s;t inhabiting the humble cottage, they never complained of the want of light or of air, but now that they &s;hut out the light from each other, they wonder their ance&s;tors &s;hould have cramped them|&s;elves thus for want of room.</P>
<P>Madrid has 15 pari&s;hes, between &s;even and 8,000 hou&s;es, 150,000 inhabitants, 66 convents, 16 col|leges, 18 ho&s;pitals, five pri&s;ons, and 15 gates, built of granite, mo&s;t of which are elegant.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="369">Almo&s;t all the &s;treets in the court part of the town, are &s;traight, wide, clean, and well paved. In walking about the town, &s;ays <HI>Twi&s;s,</HI> I ob&s;erved the names of the &s;treets, painted on the corner hou&s;es; the hou&s;es numbered, and lamps before them, the &s;ame as in the &s;treets of London. The paving is as regular and neat, as it is po&s;&s;ible to conceive, and the &s;treets kept &s;o clean, that none are to be met with more &s;o, not even in the cities of Holland: whereas ten years ago, Madrid might have vied with Edinburgh, in its former &s;tate for filth.</P>
<P>The principal &s;treet, is the <HI>calle de Alcal&aacute;,</HI> which is broad enough for 20 coaches a brea&s;t, and of a very con&s;iderable length. There are al&s;o &s;ome very beautiful &s;quares, particularly the <HI>Plaza mayor,</HI> which de&s;erves notice for its &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s and re|gularity, and the elegant and lofty hou&s;es it contains. It is 1536 feet in circuit. The hou&s;es, of which there are in this &s;quare, 136, are five &s;tories high, or|namented with balconies, the fir&s;t of which &s;up|ported by pillars, forms a piazza round the &s;quare, where the inhabitants may walk under cover.</P>
<P>There are 30 public fountains in this city, mo&s;t of them are magnificent, though ornamented in an ill ta&s;te. The water in all of them is excellent. It was this purity of the air, and excellence of the water, which induced <HI>Philip</HI> II. and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to fix
<PB N="362" REF="370">
their re&s;idence in this city. It &s;hould have been premi&s;ed, that notwith&s;tanding there are 15 gates, this city has neither fortifications, ditches, nor even walls. Its form is rather circular, and the circum|ference about &s;ix miles.</P>
<P>The king's new palace, is perhaps the grande&s;t and mo&s;t &s;umptuous of any in Europe. It is &s;itu|ated on an eminence, commanding a delightful pro&s;pect of the river Manzananes, and the country beyond it. At a di&s;tance, from its &s;tanding alone, and on an eminence, without either terrace, park, or garden, it has rather the appearance of a citadel, than a place of re&s;idence for one of the mo&s;t power|ful monarchs in the univer&s;e. But this fir&s;t impre&s;|&s;ion is &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated as we approach nearer. I have &s;een, &s;ays <HI>Twi&s;s,</HI> the palaces of the kings of England, France, Sardinia, Naples, Pru&s;&s;ia, and Portugal, tho&s;e of the Pope, the Emperor, and &s;e|veral German Princes, and indi&s;putably give the preference to this. It is impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> to view it without the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite delight. The palace pre&s;ents four fronts, each of 470 feet in length, and 100 feet in height up to the cornice, in|clo&s;ing a quadrangle of 140 feet. The&s;e fronts are relieved by numerous pillars and pila&s;tres, and over the cornice is a balu&s;trade, to hide the leaden roof. The north front has five &s;tories, be&s;ides the entre|&s;olo, and underground apartments.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="371">Within the balu&s;trade on pede&s;tals, are placed a &s;e|ries of the kings of Spain, from <HI>Ataulfo,</HI> to <HI>Fer|nando</HI> VI. The plan is &s;omewhat &s;ingular. On the principal floor, is a &s;uit of apartments, large and elegant, which communicate all round the palace, receiving light from the fronts, and inclo&s;ing rooms for the dome&s;tics, which have light from a &s;pacious gallery within. This gallery runs all round the quadrangle, over an open portico or piazza, and is covered by a terrace.</P>
<P>The foundation of this edifice, which is all of white &s;tone, was laid in the year 1737, three years after the old palace had been con&s;umed by fire, and to prevent the like accident in future, the whole is upon arches.</P>
<P>There is no palace in Europe, fitted up with &s;o much true royal magnificence. The beauty and grandeur of the upper apartments are a&s;toni&s;hing. The cielings are <HI>chef d'oeuvres</HI> of <HI>Mengs, Corrado,</HI> and <HI>Tiepolo.</HI> The riche&s;t marbles are employed with great ta&s;te, in forming the cornices and &s;ocles of the rooms, and the frames of the doors and windows. What enhances the value of the&s;e marbles is, their being all produced in the quarries of Spain, from whence it is the opinion of a learned writer, that an|cient Rome was hence &s;upplied with many of the precious materials, that enriched her porticos and
<PB N="364" REF="372">
temples. At lea&s;t, it is certain that the bowels of the earth in Spain, contain mo&s;t of tho&s;e &s;pecies of marbles, alaba&s;ters, &amp;c. that are to be &s;een in the ruins of the mi&s;tre&s;s of the world. Porphyry is found near Cordova; the fine&s;t ja&s;per near Aracena; the mountains of Granada furni&s;h a beautiful green; tho&s;e of Torto&s;a, a variety of brown marble; Leon and Malaga &s;end alaba&s;ter; Toledo and Murviedro abound in marble of different colours; and mo&s;t parts of the kingdom afford &s;ome &s;pecimens of ja&s;|per, be&s;ides the amethy&s;t and its radix, for which Spain is celebrated above mo&s;t countries.</P>
<P>The leading feature in this palace, is the audience chamber, <HI>&s;allon de los reynos,</HI> which is a double cube of 90 feet, hung round with crim&s;on velvet, and which, with its &s;umptuous canopy and painted roof, makes a mo&s;t magnificent appearance. The ceil|ing, painted by <HI>Tiepolo,</HI> repre&s;ents the triumph of Spain; round the cornice, the arti&s;t has placed al|legorical figures of its different provinces, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by their productions, and attended by their &s;everal inhabitants in their provincial habits; the&s;e form a mo&s;t uncommon picture, and curious &s;et of <HI>Co&s;tumi.</HI> The walls are incru&s;trated with beautiful marble, and all around hung with large plates of looking-gla&s;s, in rich frames.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible to view the apotheo&s;is of <HI>Hercu|les</HI>
<PB N="365" REF="373">
in the hall of conver&s;ation; and of <HI>Trajan,</HI> in the king's dining-room, without feeling the mo&s;t &s;ingular plea&s;ure and delight. In the execution of the&s;e pieces, <HI>Mengs</HI> exerted all his powers, and &s;eems to have found no difficulty in uniting ea&s;e with elegance. In the&s;e two delightful pictures we can|not readily determine which to admire mo&s;t, his de&s;igns, his lights and &s;hades, his colouring, his in|vention, or his compo&s;ition. In the antichamber is a capital picture by <HI>Vela&s;quez,</HI> repre&s;enting <HI>Philip</HI> III. <HI>Philip</HI> IV. their two wives, and <HI>Olivarez,</HI> all on hor&s;eback. "I doubt, (&s;ays <HI>Town&s;end</HI>) whether five &s;uch hor&s;es, &s;o perfect, and &s;o full of animation, were ever &s;een together; the hor&s;e of <HI>Philip</HI> IV. ri&s;es from the canvas, and &s;eems &s;o much like real life, that, if properly placed, an acute eye might be ea&s;ily deceived. There is al&s;o in the audience-chamber, a de&s;cent from the cro&s;s, by <HI>Mengs,</HI> which, according to con|noi&s;&s;eurs, is his be&s;t production. "The colour of the dead body (&s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne</HI>) has been frequently critici&s;ed. <HI>This Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;ay they, &s;eems to be of &s;tone." "I was induced, (adds the above writer) to think the &s;ame, until one day, accompanying &s;ome foreigners who adopted the critici&s;m, I heard one of them exclaim with tran&s;port, in commenda|tion of the truth of the colouring. 'Surely, (&s;aid he, in a low voice) <HI>This painter mu&s;t have &s;een many dead bodies, to have been able to imitate them &s;o well.</HI>' The author of the above reflection was an eminent
<PB N="366" REF="374">
&s;urgeon, who, till that moment, had not opened his lips on the &s;ubject. The critics were &s;ilent, and we recollected the ancient proverb, <HI>"Ne &s;ulor ultra crepidam."</HI></P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the large and capital collec|tion of pictures in this palace, which it would be tedious to enumerate, have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively brought over, in former times, by the Spani&s;h Governors of Naples, Flanders, and Milan, which accounts for their &s;urprizing number. The&s;e pictures afterwards fell into the hands of the kings of Spain; and, were they now collected and hung up, the collections in the Luxemburg and Palais Royal galleries would make no figure in compari&s;on with them. Nor mu&s;t we omit, to the di&s;grace of our own country, that there are in this king's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ome belong|ing to the unfortunate <HI>Charles</HI> I. which were vilely &s;old to Spain by his rebellious &s;ubjects. Be&s;ides the above collections, the Emperor, <HI>Charles</HI> V. invited over to Spain, the illu&s;trious <HI>Titian,</HI> who has left, both in Madrid and the E&s;curial, more capital pic|tures than any of his at Venice.</P>
<P>The royal chapel belonging to this palace is &s;aid to be more magnificent than that of Ver&s;ailles. In the organ-loft there are 70 different mi&s;&s;als, con|taining whatever is &s;ung there throughout the year, by a very numerous band of the king's mu&s;icians.
<PB N="367" REF="375">
The&s;e mi&s;&s;als are all as large as the large&s;t atlas, their leaves of vellum, all nobly bound, and rolling on bra&s;s pullies, fixed to their bottoms, that they may ea&s;ily be taken from their &s;helves and replaced. What contributes more particularly to the decora|tion of this chapel, are 16 columns of black marble, extending to the frieze.</P>
<P>The court-yard of the palace is &s;urrounded by a grand portico, and &s;o very &s;pacious that 50 coaches might wheel round it at the &s;ame in&s;tant without much ob&s;tructing each other. On the out&s;ide of the great gate, and along the principal front of the edifice, are placed, on high pede&s;tals, eight pede&s;trian &s;tatues, &s;ome of which repre&s;ent tho&s;e among the ancient Roman emperors, who were natives of Spain. The&s;e &s;tatues are of that &s;ize called he|roical.</P>
<P>At the end of the &s;quare is a large edifice, not &s;ufficiently &s;een, which contains a curious collection of ancient and foreign arms, arranged with great order, and carefully pre&s;erved. This is called the <HI>armeria,</HI> or ar&s;enal. The mo&s;t remarkable curio&s;i|ties here, are neither &s;cymeters &s;et with diamonds, nor complete &s;ets of armour, but tho&s;e of ancient American warriors: The mo&s;t con&s;picuou&s;ly placed is the armour of <HI>Montezuma.</HI> Some &s;uits of Spani&s;h armour are embo&s;&s;ed with great nicety. The tem|per
<PB N="368" REF="376">
of the &s;word-blades placed in this armory is quite wonderful, for they may be lapped round the wai&s;t like a girdle. The art of tempering &s;teel in Toledo was lo&s;t about 70 years ago, and the pro|ject of reviving it was one of the favorite &s;chemes of the late king, who has erected proper works for it on the banks of the Tagus.</P>
<P>This palace was built by <HI>Sacchetti,</HI> an <HI>&egrave;leve</HI> of <HI>Ju|vara,</HI> the famous Sicilian, who left &s;o many &s;peci|mens of his art in and about Turin. The rea&s;on of its having been erected on <HI>Sacchetti's,</HI> and not <HI>Juvara's</HI> plan, is an anecdote, &s;ingular in its kind, and not much known. In the year 1734, after the ancient palace was burnt down, the king wanting another, and being told <HI>Juvara</HI> was the mo&s;t e&s;teem|ed architect of the age, &s;ent for him. On <HI>Juvara's</HI> arrival at Madrid he was ordered to make a model. While he was employed on it, the king's &s;econd wife, who managed her hu&s;band as &s;he plea&s;ed, be|gan to think of a war, that &s;he might procure a &s;ettlement for her &s;on <HI>Charles,</HI> in Italy. In&s;tead, therefore of having the &s;everal millions de&s;tined for this purpo&s;e, laid out in building, &s;he determined they &s;hould be applied to pro&s;ecuting her own plans.</P>
<P>This &s;cheme of the queen's, it may readily be imagined, <HI>Juvara</HI> was not to be made acquainted
<PB N="369" REF="377">
with; nor was he politician enough to gue&s;s at it. He ha&s;tened to compo&s;e his model, the queen her|&s;elf affecting to &s;olicit the completion of it.</P>
<P>The model took time in forming; but, when it was brought to the king for his approbation, his mini&s;ter, who was entru&s;ted with the &s;ecret, repre|&s;ented to his maje&s;ty, that <HI>Juvara,</HI> had contrived a habitation too &s;mall for a Spani&s;h monarch, and in|&s;i&s;ted on the architect giving a plan more propor|tionate to the grandeur of its future inhabi|tants.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> was the dupe of <HI>Patino's</HI> (the mini&s;ter's name) flattering objection, e&s;pecially as the queen declared for the &s;ame opinions. Nor was <HI>Juvara</HI> him&s;elf di&s;plea&s;ed to hear it was their maje&s;ties' in|tention he &s;hould go to the utmo&s;t of his powers, and plan a palace more proportionate to his own great abilities, and the monarch's trea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Within three years <HI>Juvara</HI> produced another mo|del, &s;o very grand that he was &s;ure no objection could be rai&s;ed again&s;t it, on account of its &s;ize or magnificence, and he had the momentary &s;atisfaction to hear him&s;elf prai&s;ed by the whole court, for the lof|tine&s;s of his ideas; but, on calculating the expence, which amounted to more than 30,000,000 &s;terling, the queen and her confidant rai&s;ed the obvious objection,
<PB N="370" REF="378">
that the finances of the king could not compa&s;s &s;o much. A third plan was therefore to be thought of, that kept equally di&s;tant from the littlene&s;s of the fir&s;t, and the greatne&s;s of the &s;econd.</P>
<P>To remon&s;trate would have been u&s;ele&s;s; but, while he was thus bu&s;y, the war, that had been long hatching, broke out, the Spani&s;h doubloons began to flow into Italy, and <HI>Juvara,</HI> with his plans, were neglected. Scarce was he &s;uffered to open his lips about building, when he appeared at court. If he dared to &s;hew his drawings to the king, <HI>Patino</HI> rai&s;ed &s;o many difficulties, that the poor architect at la&s;t died of a broken heart, probably to the great joy of the crafty mini&s;ter, who had long &s;pirited him up to be very grand in his &s;econd model.</P>
<P>Soon after <HI>Juvara</HI>'s death, the king, who was bent on having a palace, enquired if he had left any di&s;ciples capable of making u&s;e of their ma&s;ter's de&s;igns. The king of Sardinia (it was an&s;wered) had two; and <HI>Sacchetti</HI> being reckoned the be&s;t, he was &s;ent for to Spain, where he made the model of the pre&s;ent palace, which was approved; and, as the war was approaching to its end, &s;oon after begun.</P>
<P>The fini&s;hing and fitting up of this palace, has, in all probability, &s;aved the capital from ruin, by
<PB N="371" REF="379">
fixing the court to this &s;pot. The king intended to have removed it for ever to Seville and the &s;outh|ern provinces, after the &s;edition in Madrid, when the populace ro&s;e in con&s;equence of the order for cleaning the &s;treets, and prohibiting &s;louched hats, and large cloaks. His &s;urprize, re&s;entment, and in|dignation, would certainly have induced him to quit for ever &s;o barbarous a metropolis, had not his mi|ni&s;ter, unwilling that &s;o much money &s;hould be la|vi&s;hed to no purpo&s;e, in improving the palaces in Ca&s;tille, prevailed on his royal ma&s;ter to conquer his anger, and alter his determination. It is very remarkable that, during the greate&s;t ferment of the &s;edition, all parties retired, as if by mutual con&s;ent, about dinner-time, to take their u&s;ual nap or meri|dian, after which they returned to the charge with fre&s;h vigour, and redoubled fury, re&s;umed their clamours and repeated their outrages. The military force finally quelled the tumult, and the king carried his point. Every blackguard now loiters about with his hat pinned up triangularly; but the moment he gets out of town, and beyond the bounds of the pro|clamation, indulges him&s;elf in flapping it down on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>The palace of the <HI>Buen Retiro</HI> is a plea&s;ant retreat, &s;ituated upon an eminence, at the extremity of the city; is a va&s;t pile of buildings, very ancient, and verging to decay. It contains &s;ome &s;pacious apart|ments,
<PB N="372" REF="380">
in which there &s;till remains a few good pictures. "But the three things (&s;ays <HI>Town&s;end</HI>) which gave mo&s;t &s;atisfaction were, the theatre, the grand &s;aloon, and the eque&s;trian &s;tatue of <HI>Philip</HI> IV. This &s;tatue ca&s;t by <HI>Pedro Tacca,</HI> from a painting of <HI>Vela&s;quez,</HI> and &s;aid to weigh nine tons, is &s;upported by the hind legs alone. I never &s;aw, nor can con|ceive any thing more perfect, or which appears &s;o animated as this prodigy of art. The theatre is va&s;t, and opens into the gardens &s;o as to make them, upon occa&s;ion, a continuation of the &s;cene. Here <HI>Ferdinand</HI> VI. frequently amu&s;ed the public with operas, with which his queen was &s;o extravagantly fond.</P>
<P>The great &s;aloon, called <HI>El Salon,</HI> with its an|tichamber, painted in <HI>fre&s;co,</HI> by <HI>Jordano,</HI> remains a monument of his ta&s;te, invention, judgement, and imitative powers. In the principal compartment of the roof is repre&s;ented <HI>Hercules</HI> giving the golden fleece to <HI>Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.</HI> In a &s;ubordinate compartment, <HI>Pallas</HI> and the gods are &s;een &s;ubduing the <HI>Titans;</HI> an&s;wering to which, the maje&s;ty of Spain appears ruling the terre&s;trial globe. The re&s;t is filled up with allegorical figures finely expre&s;&s;ed. The antichamber contains the conque&s;t of Granada. From the great &s;aloon we go to the garden, by a little oval cabinet, covered entirely with looking-gla&s;s, in the ceiling of which is repre|&s;ented
<PB N="373" REF="381">
the birth of the &s;un, with people of all nati|ons wor&s;hipping the ri&s;ing deity, whil&s;t the prie&s;ts are engaged in offering &s;acrifices. This likewi&s;e is by <HI>Jordano.</HI> In one of the apartments, &s;eldom &s;hewn to foreigners, are models of &s;trong places; among the&s;e, the two mo&s;t &s;triking are Cadiz and Gibraltar.</P>
<P>To a &s;tranger, the &s;ituation of Buen-retiro, appears preferable for a royal re&s;idence, to that in which the new palace &s;tands; but there may be, perhaps, ob|jections which do not pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the tran|&s;ient ob&s;erver. The gardens of this palace are ex|ten&s;ive, and have a plea&s;ing variety of wood and water. They are at pre&s;ent open to the public. The late monarch e&s;tabli&s;hed a china manufacture in them, which as yet, &s;trangers have not been per|mitted to in&s;pect. Its productions are to be &s;een no where, but in the palace of the &s;overeign, or in &s;ome Italian courts, to which they have been &s;ent as pre|&s;ents. Some particular kinds of inlaid work, not much known in Europe, are likewi&s;e carried on there.</P>
<P>This ancient palace likewi&s;e commands a public walk, which has long been famous in Spani&s;h co|medy and romance: at fir&s;t, indeed, the&s;e alone gave it celebrity. In the place it&s;elf, there was no|thing remarkable; its reputation aro&s;e from what
<PB N="374" REF="382">
pa&s;&s;ed in it. Mea&s;ures were then concerted to elude the vigilance of a mother, or jealou&s;y of a hu&s;band. The courtiers e&s;caped perhaps from the pre&s;ence of a monarch, came thither to watch a rival, prepare a plot, or di&s;concert an intrigue. The proximity of the palace, the ob&s;curity and inequality of the ground, were all favourable for the&s;e purpo&s;es. The <HI>Prado</HI> was a rendezvous, equally convenient for ambition and malignity, but more e&s;pecially for love. Tho&s;e who appeared there, had generally &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter de|&s;ign, or were encountering &s;ome hazard. But <HI>Charles</HI> III. by levelling it, planted it with trees, ad|mitting more light into the alleys, ornamenting it with &s;tatues, and va&s;es, and providing water to allay the du&s;t, has now made it a mo&s;t elegant walk, which may be frequented in all &s;ea&s;ons, with &s;afety and plea&s;ure. It forms a part of the interior of the city, and is in length nearly two miles. Several of the principal &s;treets terminate here. That of Alcala, the wide&s;t in Europe, cro&s;&s;es it, runs by the &s;ide of the gardens of the Retiro, and terminates at the gate of the &s;ame name, which, as we have already ob|&s;erved, is one of the fine&s;t pieces of architecture in the capital, and built in the late reign, in 1778.</P>
<P>The inhabitants from all quarters re&s;ort hither, on foot, or in carriages, to meet and breathe beneath the &s;hade of long alleys, an air fre&s;hened by water, &s;pouted from the fountains, and embalmed by ex|halations
<PB N="375" REF="383">
from the fragrant flowers. The concour&s;e of people is frequently prodigious. There may be &s;ometimes &s;een between four and 500 carriages, fil|ing off in the greate&s;t order, amid&s;t an innumera|able crowd of &s;pectators: a &s;pectacle at once a proof of great opulence and population.</P>
<P><HI>Town&s;end</HI> notices a very &s;ingular ceremony he &s;aw practi&s;ed on the walk. The coaches, &s;ays he, were numerous, and the walls were crowded; all was in motion; when &s;uddenly about eight in the evening, on the tolling of a bell, I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee all motion cea&s;e; every coach &s;tood &s;till, every hat was off, and every lip &s;eemed to utter prayer. This, I afterwards found to be the cu&s;tom all over Spain. If the affections of the heart corre&s;pond with the external &s;igns of piety in Spain; and if the moral conduct an&s;wers to the affections of the heart, this people mu&s;t be the mo&s;t heavenly minded, and the mo&s;t virtuous upon earth. But all is not gold that glitters; and I had &s;oon an opportunity of forming a conjecture, that all who thus moved the lip, were not among the warme&s;t friends of piety and vir|tue. When the prayer was over, the coaches began to move &s;lowly on once more, but &s;oon after this, went bri&s;kly off, and the multitude di&s;per&s;ing, left a number of young women, attended by young men, who from that time &s;eemed to be more at ea&s;e, yet kept within the bounds of decency.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="384"><HI>Swinburne,</HI> in his account of this famous walk, &s;ays, it is &s;ituated in the &s;hallow vale, between the Retiro and the town, which has not the lea&s;t &s;uburb of any kind belonging to it. Its length and breadth are great, the avenues drawn in an intelligent, noble &s;tyle; the foot-paths wide and neat; the iron railing and &s;tone &s;eats, done in a grand and expen&s;ive man|ner. The view from this walk is, as it &s;hould be, confined; for the winds are &s;o &s;harp and boi&s;terous, and the land&s;cape &s;o horrid all round the city, that no place of public re&s;ort, like this, could be com|fortable, unle&s;s it were &s;hut in from all di&s;tant views, and &s;heltered by hills from the bla&s;ts that &s;weep over the high lands of Ca&s;tille.</P>
<P>To the we&s;t it has the town, the three principal &s;treets of which, as we have already remarked, ter|minate in the Prado; there are three noble open|ings, excellently paved, and clean even to a nicety; indeed, &s;o are mo&s;t of the &s;treets, &s;ince the edict for paving and cleaning them. The foreigners re&s;id|ing here before that period, &s;hudder at the very re|collection of its filth. Some of the natives, indeed, regret the old &s;tinks and na&s;tine&s;s, pretending that the air of Madrid is &s;o &s;ubtle, as to require a proper mixture of gro&s;&s;er effluvia, to prevent its pernicious effects upon the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Till of very late years, there were no privies in
<PB N="377" REF="385">
Madrid: but the king, determined to clean&s;e the place, ordered that privies &s;hould be built in every hou&s;e. The phy&s;icians remon&s;trated again&s;t it, &s;ay|ing, that the &s;mell &s;oftened the air, and deprived it of tho&s;e noxious vapours, that would be injurious to health. This, however, would not do; but le&s;t their food &s;hould imbibe the&s;e noxious vapours, the people, one and all, placed their privies by the kitch|en fire-&s;ide.</P>
<P>The extremes of heat and cold are a&s;toni&s;hing in this place; and the winds &s;o &s;earching, that all the Spaniards wear leather under wai&s;tcoats to pre|&s;erve their che&s;ts, for they pervade every other kind of cloathing.</P>
<P>The botannical garden, adds not a little to the embelli&s;hment of the Prado; it was formerly on the road, leading from Madrid to the Ca&s;tle of Pardo; but the late king removed it a few years &s;ince, to the &s;ide of the Prado, and &s;urrounded it with a low en|clo&s;ure, by which it is ornamented, without being hid. This monarch endeavoured to make it one of the mo&s;t precious collections of the kind, by laying under contribution, all the vegetable kingdom of his dominions, &s;ome part of which, it has been long &s;aid, is continually warmed by the rays of the &s;un, which in &s;uch different &s;oils and climates, mu&s;t
<PB N="378" REF="386">
alone produce every kind of tree, &s;hrub, and plant, which grows on the bo&s;om of the earth.</P>
<P>While viewing the Prado, &s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne,</HI> I have frequently given the greate&s;t latitude po&s;&s;ible to this idea. I have even extended it to the animal kingdom. I have allotted in imagination, a &s;pace, which the botanical garden leaves vacant by the &s;ide of the walk, to a de&s;tination certainly &s;ingular in Europe, and which the monarch of Spain only is ca|pable of carrying into effect. I divided it into as many parts, as this &s;overeign has principal colonies under his dominions; in the&s;e, I &s;ettled, in &s;uppo&s;i|tion, a family of Peruvians, another of Mexicans, another from California, another from Loui&s;iana, another from Paraguay, from Buenos Aynes, the coa&s;t of Caracas, from Porto Rico, from Cuba, from the Canaries, and the Philippines. All to pre&s;erve their peculiar dre&s;s and manner of living, to erect a &s;imple habitation upon the model of the one they had quitted; and to cultivate the plants brought from their own country; &s;o that &s;urrounded by the&s;e plea&s;ing illu&s;ions, they might &s;till &s;uppo&s;e them|&s;elves in their native &s;oil. Here the Mexican would be &s;een beneath the &s;hade of his own fig-tree, &s;hak|ing it and gathering the precious &s;poils, which co|lour our European garments; there the inhabitant of Guatimala, would cultivate his indigo; and he of Paraguay, the herb which con&s;titutes his prin|cipal
<PB N="379" REF="387">
riches; the native of Soconu&s;co would attempt to naturalize his valuable cocoa-tree in a foreign &s;oil; the Peruvian, accompanied by the docile animal, which partakes of his labours, feeds, and clothes him, would, in concert with the Luconian, endea|vour to introduce the &s;ame cultivation they had been accu&s;tomed to at home. Thus the exulting inhabitant of the metropolis, without going from the capital, might pa&s;s in review, as if delineated on a map, all the colonies to which his &s;overeign gives laws. The tran&s;ported coloni&s;t would become ac|cu&s;tomed to an exile, which every thing would con|cur to render plea&s;ing; and his fellow citizens &s;e|parated from him by immen&s;e &s;ea, on being informed of the benevolence and magnificence of their common monarch, would form a higher idea of his power, pride them&s;elves upon being his &s;ubjects, and be|come more attached to his government.</P>
<P>Such a project may be con&s;idered as romantic, yet the king of Spain has entered upon one of the &s;ame kind, which proves his zeal for the advance|ment of the arts and &s;ciences. In the &s;treet of the Alcala, is a large building, in which he has e&s;tabli&s;hed a cabinet of natural hi&s;tory, which already contains one of the complete&s;t collections in Eu|rope, in metals, minerals, marble, precious &s;tones, corals, and marine plants. The collection of the king of Spain, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> is truly magnificent,
<PB N="380" REF="388">
but far from being well cho&s;en, or well arranged. For intrin&s;ic value in &s;ilver, gold, and precious &s;tones, perhaps no cabinet can equal it.</P>
<P>The &s;pecimen which mo&s;t attracted my attention, &s;ays the above writer, was a large rock, containing 40 emeralds, in the form of hexagonal pri&s;ms, &s;ome near an inch diameter, and one inch and an half in length, and many of them of the fine&s;t water, with|out the lea&s;t appearance of a flaw.</P>
<P>The animals are beautiful, and in high pre&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>The cabinet of natural hi&s;tory, is acce&s;&s;ible to all; there is no need to wait for tickets; but at the ap|pointed hours, any per&s;on who is decent in his ap|pearance, is admitted to walk round the rooms, and examine what he plea&s;es, as long as the doors are open. If he is peculiarly devoted to one branch of natural hi&s;tory, he is not hurried away from that by the gaping multitude, and compelled to &s;pend the allotted portion of his time, in apartments which contain nothing to his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The foundation of this collection was laid by <HI>M. Davila,</HI> but it is &s;aid, that after he had pub|li&s;hed his much admired catalogue, the be&s;t of the &s;pecimens were picked and culled, and the refu&s;e
<PB N="381" REF="389">
only carried to the king, who made the purcha&s;e, and appointed him fir&s;t director of his cabinet.</P>
<P>This &s;cience is almo&s;t new in Europe. Sir <HI>Hans Sloane</HI> led the way in England, <HI>Buffon</HI> followed in France, and <HI>Davila</HI> has brought up the rear. It is but of late years, that the &s;overeigns of Europe have taken it under their protection. England &s;et the example, and Spain has followed it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame edifice that contains this cabinet, and which with the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e built al&s;o by <HI>Charles</HI> III. con&s;titutes the principal ornament of the &s;treet of the Alcala, is the place of meeting for the academy of the fine arts; a circum&s;tance which occa&s;ioned the in&s;cription on the front of the build|ing, a motto equally happy and ju&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Carolus III. naturam &amp; artem &s;ub uno tecto con|&s;ociavit.</HI></P>
<P>"Charles III. a&s;&s;ociated art and nature under one roof.</P>
<P>The honor of in&s;tituting this academy, is, howe|ever, due to <HI>Philip</HI> V. but it has received great en|couragement from his two &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>This academy of the arts, like that we have de|&s;cribed at Barcelona, is open to the whole world, and every thing provided at the king's expence.
<PB N="382" REF="390">
There are three other academies. The Spani&s;h aca|demy, founded in 1714, in imitation of the French academy, the fir&s;t object of which, was the com|pilation of a dictionary of the Spani&s;h language, publi&s;hed in &s;ix volumes, folio. The academy of hi&s;tory, which owes its origin to a &s;ociety of indi|viduals, the object of who&s;e meetings was to pre|&s;erve and illu&s;trate the hi&s;torical monuments of the kingdom of Spain. The academy of medicine is held in no great e&s;teem.</P>
<P>If the plea&s;ing arts are cultivated at Madrid, the mo&s;t u&s;eful of all, that of beneficence, is not neg|lected. Charitable foundations, worthy to be mo|dels to every nation, are found in that city. There are three ho&s;pitals, which, in the cour&s;e of the year 1785, received 19,437 patients. The principal or general ho&s;pital for men, as it is called, has been lately rebuilt. It contains no le&s;s than 5,000 iron beds, di&s;tributed through &s;everal large rooms, and long galleries. It is a rule here, to receive every one who comes at any hour of the day or night; nor is any &s;olicitation reque&s;ted to obtain admittance; there are even porters belonging to the ho&s;pital, who&s;e only bu&s;ine&s;s it is to go and fetch every &s;ick per&s;on who &s;ends for them. And at the gate of the ho&s;pital, there is always a phy&s;ician in waiting, to enquire into the complaint of every patient who
<PB N="383" REF="391">
comes, and to order him immediately into the pro|per ward accordingly.</P>
<P>As I &s;tood at the gate, &s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI> an old man was brought there in a kind of covered &s;edan. This phy&s;ician lifted up the head of the chair, and put this blunt que&s;tion to him: <HI>Tiene u&s;ted gallico?</HI> "Have you the foul di&s;ea&s;e?" It &s;urpri&s;ed me not a little, to hear the &s;hamele&s;s &s;exagenarian an&s;wer in the affirmative with the cleare&s;t tone of voice, and the greate&s;t tranquillity of countenance imaginable. Wandering about the different apartments, I could not but take notice of their great cleanne&s;s. I en|quired of &s;everal &s;ick men about the treatment they met with, and was plea&s;ed with their an&s;wers. Among the &s;everal articles of diet, each patient is al|lowed a large di&s;h of chocolate every morning, by way of breakfa&s;t, with a &s;lice of bread, or a &s;weet bi&s;cuit. This appears a remarkable &s;ingularity. Nor are they &s;tinted in point of food, when they begin to recover, except the phy&s;icians are very po|&s;itive in their orders to the contrary.</P>
<P>It is not the cu&s;tom here, to &s;upport any ho&s;pital by voluntary contributions, ince&s;&s;antly collected from the people, as in England. In this country, each ho&s;pital has an income ari&s;ing from lands and other kinds of property; Various <HI>confradias</HI> have an eye over them. The principal nobility do not di&s;dain
<PB N="384" REF="392">
to be members of the&s;e &s;ocieties. They vi&s;it the ho&s;pitals by turns, audit the accounts, and take care that no part of the income is embezzled or mi&s;ma|naged. The church grants &s;ome indulgencies for the&s;e pious deeds, and this &s;eems to be all the re|compence they wi&s;h for their trouble.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e <HI>confradias</HI> there is one called <HI>La Santa Hermandad, "the holy brotherhood;"</HI> or, more commonly, <HI>La confradia de Pan y Huevos, "the brotherhood of bread and eggs."</HI> A number of its members, preceded generally by &s;ome con&s;iderable nobleman, ramble about the &s;treets of Madrid, every night, in order to collect the hou&s;ele&s;s of both &s;exes, who lay them&s;elves down to &s;leep under the porches of churches, or the entrances of hou&s;es. The <HI>Santa Hermandad</HI> take up all tho&s;e they find in this pitiable &s;ituation, carry them to &s;ome ho&s;pital to &s;leep, and give them, the next morning, a penny loaf with a couple of eggs for their breakfa&s;t; from which practice is derived their appellation. If the&s;e poor are in health, they are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, if di&s;ea&s;ed they are kept till cured. Were &s;omething of the kind adopted in London, where the hou&s;ele&s;s poor are very numerous, it would be a mo&s;t beneficent in&s;titution.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed that the abovementioned ho&s;pital is endowed with a very con&s;iderable re|venue.
<PB N="185" REF="393">
It is &s;aid to amount to 40,000 doubloons, or &pound;30,000 &s;terling.</P>
<P>There are neither hackney chairs nor hackney coaches in Madrid. A foreigner therefore cannot ride about the town upon the &s;ame ea&s;y terms as he may in London, Paris, and many other great cities. He who keeps no carriage mu&s;t either walk or hire one for the day, which may be had for about 30 reals. All carriages are here drawn by mules, and the coachmen might with more propriety be termed po&s;tillions, as they ride on the mule, in&s;tead of &s;it|ting on the coach-box, a practice which certainly ob&s;tructs the &s;ight le&s;s, through the front gla&s;s of the carriage.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of driving with mules in&s;tead of hor&s;es is univer&s;al; and for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e the hor&s;es in Spain are not &s;o well able to re&s;i&s;t the parching heats in &s;ummer, and the &s;evere bla&s;ts in winter, when the &s;now covers the hills on the &s;ides of the E&s;curial. Some of the amba&s;&s;adors, who would not conform to this cu&s;tom, have had rea&s;on to repent of this &s;ingularity, as no one pair of hor&s;es would la&s;t them the year through, whether they had Spani&s;h or foreign hor&s;es.</P>
<P>No per&s;on is allowed to drive about Madrid with more than four mules to his carriage. The king
<PB N="386" REF="394">
only has &s;ix, and &s;ometimes eight, but then he is &s;eldom at Madrid. In the environs the nobility are allowed to travel with fix, but very few are permit|ted to enter the gates with them. The great officers of &s;tate, and the foreign mini&s;ters, only, have this privilege, and the&s;e are obliged to drive &s;trait home from the gate at which they enter.</P>
<P>There are few beggars in this city, and tho&s;e few do not wander about, but remain fixed to one parti|cular &s;pot; where, however they do not much im|portune pa&s;&s;engers with their &s;upplications, extend|ing only their hands, with a craving look. If any thing is given them it is well; if not, they never open their lips.</P>
<P>If a per&s;on wants to go a few leagues off, he may hire a <HI>caleffin;</HI> that is, an open chai&s;e, drawn by a &s;ingle hor&s;e. The driver runs on foot by the &s;ide of the chai&s;e; and when tired, gets up behind; but on foot or behind, he never cea&s;es hooting and whipping the poor jade, to make it trot. In this manner they will make them go about &s;ix miles an hour.</P>
<P>At Madrid the hotels are good. They have no <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">able-d'hote</HI> but every one dines in his own apart|ment, where he is &s;erved with two cour&s;es, each of four or five di&s;hes, with a de&s;&s;ert, and one &s;uch
<PB N="387" REF="395">
cour&s;e for &s;upper, with plenty of good wine, for which he pays &s;even livres and an half a day, in|cluding lodging; but, if he eats no &s;upper, then his dinner and his two rooms will co&s;t him only five livres, or four and two-pence Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Like the French, the Spaniards drink their wine at dinner; but, when they have fini&s;hed their de&s;|&s;ert, and taken coffee, they retire to their couch.</P>
<P>When they retire from the <HI>fie&s;ta</HI> they get into their carriages, to parade up and down the Prado, never going fa&s;ter than a walk. As they march &s;lowly in one direction, they look into the coaches which are returning in the other, and bow to their acquaint|ances every time they pa&s;s.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the day people &s;ay the u&s;ual prayer; then wi&s;h each other a good evening, and begin retiring to their hou&s;es, when they take their <HI>refre&s;cos</HI> of chocolate, with bi&s;cuits, and a gla&s;s of water.</P>
<P>When properly introduced into a Spani&s;h family, a &s;tranger is told at parting, "Now, Sir, you are ma&s;ter of this hou&s;e;" but the extent of the grant mu&s;t be judged of by your own natural &s;agacity; becau&s;e, &s;uch is the politene&s;s of a Spaniard, that he makes u&s;e of this expre&s;&s;ion when nothing more
<PB N="388" REF="396">
is meant than that you are at liberty to call upon him; accordingly you &s;ee many retire before each meal, or drop in after it; but, when it is taken in the full extent, the grant means dinner, <HI>refre&s;co,</HI> &s;upper; any or all, whenever it may &s;uit you to par|take of them.</P>
<P>The people of fa&s;hion in this city are very obliging to &s;trangers, when once introduced to them; nor do the common people give bad language, or angry looks to &s;trangers, as is but too common in Eng|land. As to the Spani&s;h grandees, they &s;eldom mix either with foreigners or natives, who are not of the &s;ame rank with them&s;elves. The foreign mini&s;|ters, in particular, &s;carce ever mix with any but the great officers of &s;tate; from whence it may be con|cluded, that it is not the cu&s;tom for the Spani&s;h no|bility to keep open hou&s;es, like tho&s;e of almo&s;t every other capital in Europe. Yet &s;ome of them are very rich, nor can they be taxed with avarice, living in general with great &s;plendour; but the mode of &s;pending their money is different from that of other countries, and generally con&s;i&s;ts in keeping a numerous court, within doors, of chap|lains, &s;ecretaries, pages, and a great number of li|very-&s;ervants, together with a very con&s;iderable number of equipages. Be&s;ides, very few of the grandees ever di&s;mi&s;s a &s;ervant once e&s;tabli&s;hed in their families, unle&s;s for &s;ome very enormous
<PB N="389" REF="397">
offences, he and his family remain pen&s;ioners as long as they live. There are &s;ome who pay near &pound;10,000 &s;terling a year, in wages and annuities to &s;ervants.</P>
<P>"The grandees (&s;ays <HI>Swinburne</HI>) are dimini&s;hed, by a &s;eries of di&s;tempered progenitors, to a race of pigmies, which dwindle away for want of heirs, and tends gradually to a union of all the titles and e&s;tates upon the heads of one or two families. There is one nobleman who has no le&s;s than 19 gran|dee&s;hips centered in his per&s;on. Though they all &s;tile them&s;elves <HI>de premiere cla&s;&s;e,</HI> as it were, by way of di&s;tinctive pre-eminence over others of a lower degree; yet I believe (&s;ays the above writer) no &s;econd or third cla&s;s exi&s;ts; and it would be a gro&s;s in&s;ult to &s;uppo&s;e any of them of an inferior rank to the re&s;t of the <HI>corps;</HI> &s;ome difference may, perhaps, be made in the degrees of popular re&s;pect paid to the de&s;cendants of heroes, who made a figure in the Spani&s;h annals, and &s;uch grandees as have been ho|noured with that dignity in latter times. There are &s;everal noble families, who, by their antiquity, have a right to the honour of grandee, but, as the king has never ordered them to be covered, they are &s;tiled <HI>ca&s;as agravias,</HI> "injured heroes."</P>
<P>The king calls the grandees <HI>Cou&s;in,</HI> when he writes to them. When they receive audience of the Pope

they are allowed to &s;it; they cannot be arre&s;ted for any crime what&s;oever, without an expre&s;s order from his maje&s;ty. They alone have the privilege to drive with four mules to their carriage within Madrid, whil&s;t the king is there. Among them all titles are equal. Dukes, marqui&s;&s;es, or counts have no pre|cedence the one before the other. The grandees, both in conver&s;ation and in writing to each other, always u&s;e <HI>thee</HI> and <HI>thou,</HI> but to their inferiors they make u&s;e of the ordinary &s;tile.</P>
<P>In the folio book, entitled <HI>Creacion y Privilegios de los Tilulos de Ca&s;tilla,</HI> printed in Madrid, 1769, 43 privileges are annexed to the dignity of grandee, among which, be&s;ides tho&s;e abovementioned, are the following: They may never be put to the tor|ture; they may have four footmen and four torches behind their carriage, as may al&s;o dukes (earls and marqui&s;&s;es are allowed but two); they are permitted to have a throne, under a canopy, in one room in their hou&s;es; this privilege is, however, granted to various other dignities, &s;pecified in the book:</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h women are, in general, little and thin; few are &s;trikingly beautiful, but almo&s;t all have &s;parkling black eyes, full of expre&s;&s;ion. It is not the fa&s;hion in Spain, as in France, to heighten their <HI>eclat</HI> with paint. They are endowed by na|ture with a great deal of wit and lively repartee;
<PB N="391" REF="399">
but, for want of the poli&s;h and &s;uccours of educa|tion, their wit remains ob&s;cured by the rude&s;t ig|norance and mo&s;t ridiculous prejudices. Their tempers having never been fa&s;hioned by polite in|tercour&s;e, nor &s;oftened by nece&s;&s;ary contradiction, are extremely petti&s;h and violent. They are conti|nually pouting for &s;omething or other, and put out of humour by trifles.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the ladies about court are the rever&s;e of hand&s;ome, and do not &s;eem to have any ambition of being thought clever or accompli&s;hed; not one talent do they po&s;&s;e&s;s, nor do they ever work, read, write, or touch any mu&s;ical in&s;trument, their <HI>cortejo,</HI> or gallant, &s;eeming their only plaything. "The accounts given me, (&s;ays <HI>Swinburne</HI>) of their man|ner of living, in their family-way, as &s;oon as they come out of the convent, and before they have fixed on a lover to fill up their time more agreeably, is as follows: they ri&s;e late, and loiter away the remain|der of the morning among their attendants, or wear it out at church in a long bead-roll of habitual un|meaning prayers; they dine &s;paringly, &s;leep, and then dre&s;s, to &s;aunter for a couple of hours on the Prado. They are never without &s;ome &s;ort of &s;ugar-plum, or high-&s;piced comfit, in their mouths. As &s;oon as it is du&s;k they run to the hou&s;e of &s;ome elderly female relation, where they all herd together over a pan of coals, and would not for the world approach the

company that may occa&s;ionally drop in; it would throw them into the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, were they reque&s;ted to join in the conver&s;ation. The hour of the a&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed, they hurry home to their maids, and, with their help, &s;et about dre&s;&s;ing their &s;uppers, by way of amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>As people of fa&s;hion &s;eldom a&s;&s;emble to eat at each other's hou&s;es, this is no doubt one of the cir|cum&s;tances which contributes to their reputation for &s;obriety. They are likewi&s;e little acquainted with the innocent and healthful recreations of the country. But few among them are fond of the chace, of which the monarch and his family &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s the exclu&s;ive privilege. Country amu&s;e|ments, in &s;hort, &s;eem to have no attractions for the Spaniards. Their country-hou&s;es might ea&s;ily be numbered. Among the many rich individuals who inhabit the capital, there are, perhaps not ten who have a country-retreat.</P>
