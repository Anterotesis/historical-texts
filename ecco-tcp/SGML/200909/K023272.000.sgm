<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the tyrannies that afflict mankind tyranny in religion is the wor&s;t: Every other &s;pecies of tyranny is limited to the world we live in; but this attempts a &s;tride beyond the grave, and &s;eeks to pur|&s;ue us into eternity. It is there, and not here, it is to God and not to man, it is to a heavenly and not to an earthly tribunal, that we are to account for our belief; if then we believe fal&s;ely and di&s;honourably of the Creator, and that belief is forced upon us, as far as force can operate, by human laws and human tribunals, on whom is the crimi|nality of that belief to fall; on tho&s;e who impo&s;e it, or on tho&s;e on whom it is impo&s;ed?</P>
<P>A book&s;eller o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the name of Williams has been pro&s;ecuted in Lon|don on a charge of bla&s;phemy, for publi&s;hing a book intitled the <HI>Age of Rea&s;on:</HI> Bla&s;phemy is a word of va&s;t &s;ound, but of equivocal and almo&s;t indefinite &s;ignification; unle&s;s we confine it to the &s;imple idea of hurting or injuring the reputation of any one, which was its original meaning. As a word, it exi&s;ted before Chri&s;tianity exi&s;ted, being a Greek word, or Greek anglofied, as all the etymological dictionaries will &s;hew.</P>
<P>But behold how various and contradictory has been the &s;ignification and application of this equivocal word: Socrates, who lived more than four hundred years before the Chri&s;tian aera, was convicted of bla&s;phemy, for preaching again&s;t the belief of a plurality of gods, and for preaching the belief of one god, and was condemned to &s;uffer death by poi&s;on: Je&s;us Chri&s;t was convicted of bla&s;phemy under the Jewi&s;h law, and was crucified. Calling Mahomet an impo&s;tor would be bla&s;phemy in Turkey; and denying the infallibility of the Pope and the Church would be bla&s;phemy at Rome. What then is to be under&s;tood by this word bla&s;phemy? We &s;ee that in the ca&s;e of Socrates, truth was condemned as bla&s;phemy. Are we &s;ure that truth is not bla&s;phemy in the pre&s;ent day? Woe, however, be to tho&s;e who make it &s;o, whoever they may be.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">A book called the bible has been voted by men, and decreed by hu|man laws, to be the word of God, and the di&s;belief of this is called bla&s;phemy. But if the bible be not the word of God, it is the laws, and the execution of them, that is bla&s;phemy, and not the di&s;belief. Strange &s;tories are told of the Creator in that book. He is repre&s;ented as acting under the influence of every human pa&s;&s;ion, even of the mo&s;t malignant kind. If the&s;e &s;tories are fal&s;e, we err in believing them to be true, and ought not to believe them. It is therefore a duty, which every man owes to him&s;elf, and reverentially to his Maker, to a&s;certain by every po&s;&s;ible enquiry, whether there be &s;ufficient evi|dence to believe them or not.</P>
<P>My own opinion is decidedly, that the evidence does not warrant the belief, and that we &s;in in forcing that belief upon our&s;elves, and upon others. In &s;aying this, I have no other object in view, than truth. But that I may not be accu&s;ed of re&s;ting upon bare a&s;&s;ertion, with re&s;pect to the equivocal &s;tate of the bible, I will produce an ex|ample, and I will not pick and cull the bible for the purpo&s;e. I will go fairly to the ca&s;e I will take the two fir&s;t chapters of Gene&s;is, as they &s;tand, and &s;hew from thence the truth of what I &s;ay, that is, that the evidence does not warrant the belief, that the bible is the word of God.</P>

<P N="1">1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</P>
<P N="2">2 And the earth was without form and void, and darkne&s;s was upon the face of the deep: and the &s;pirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</P>
<P N="3">3 And God &s;aid, Let there be light: and there was light.</P>
<P N="4">4 And God &s;aw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkne&s;s.</P>

<P N="6">6 &para; And God &s;aid, Let there be a firmament in the mid&s;t of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</P>
<P N="7">7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament, from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was &s;o.</P>
<P N="8">8 And God called the firmament Heaven: and the evening and the morning were the &s;econd day.</P>
<P N="9">9 &para; And God &s;aid, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was &s;o.</P>
<P N="10">10 And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God &s;aw that it was good.</P>
<P N="11">11 And God &s;aid, Let the earth bring forth gra&s;s, the herb yielding &s;eed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after his kind, who&s;e &s;eed is in it|&s;elf, upon the earth: and it was &s;o.</P>
<P N="12">12 And the earth brought forth gra&s;s, and herb yielding &s;eed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, who&s;e &s;eed was in it&s;elf, after his kind: and God &s;aw that it was good.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="7" REF="6">13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.</P>
<P N="14">14 &para; And God &s;aid, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night: and let them be for &s;igns, and for &s;ea&s;ons, and for days, and years.</P>
<P N="15">15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth: and it was &s;o.</P>
<P N="16">16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the le&s;&s;er light to rule the night: he made the &s;tars al&s;o.</P>
<P N="17">17 And God &s;et them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth,</P>

<P N="19">19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</P>
<P N="20">20 And God &s;aid, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the mov|ing creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</P>
<P N="21">21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God &s;aw that it was good.</P>
<P N="22">22 And God ble&s;&s;ed them, &s;aying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the &s;eas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</P>
<P N="23">23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</P>

<P N="29">29 &para; And God &s;aid, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing &s;eed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding &s;eed: to you it &s;hall be for meat.</P>

<P N="1">1 Thus the heavens and the earth were fini&s;hed, and all the ho&s;t of them.</P>
<P N="2">2 And on the &s;eventh day God ended his work which he had made, and he re&s;ted on the &s;eventh day from all his work which he had made.</P>
<P N="3">3 And God ble&s;&s;ed the &s;eventh day, and &s;anctified it: becau&s;e that in it he had re&s;ted from all his work, which God created and made.</P>
<P N="4">4 &para; The&s;e are the generations of the heavens and of the earth, when they were created; in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,</P>
<P N="5">5 And every plant of the field, before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field, before it grew: for the Lord God had not cau&s;ed it to rain upon the earth, <HI>and there was not a man to till the ground.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6 But there went up a mi&s;t from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</P>
<P N="7">7 And the Lord God formed man of the du&s;t of the ground, and breated into his no&s;trils the breath of life; and man became a living &s;oul.</P>
<P N="8">8 &para; And the Lord God planted a garden ea&s;tward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</P>
<P N="9">9 And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is plea&s;ant to the &s;ight, and good for food: the tree of life al&s;o in the mid&s;t of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</P>
<P N="10">10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</P>
<P N="11">11 The name of the fir&s;t is Pi&s;on: that is it which compa&s;&s;eth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.</P>

<P N="15">15 And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dre&s;s it and to keep it.</P>
<P N="16">16 And the Lord God commanded the man, &s;aying, Of every tree of the garden thou maye&s;t freely eat:</P>

<P N="18">18 &para; And the Lord God &s;aid, it is not good that the man &s;hould be alone: I will make him an help meet for him.</P>
<P N="19">19 And out of the ground the Lord God formed every bea&s;t of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them unto Adam to &s;ee

</TEXT></Q>
<P>The&s;e two chapters are called the Mo&s;aic account of the creation; and we are told, nobody knows by whom, that Mo&s;es was in&s;tructed by God to write that account.</P>
<P>It has happened that every nation of people has been world-makers; and each makes the world to begin his own way, as if they had all been brought up, as Hudibra&s;s &s;ays, to the trade. There are hundreds of different opinions and traditions how the world began. My bu&s;ine&s;s, however, in this place, is only with tho&s;e two chapters.</P>
<P>I begin then by &s;aying, that tho&s;e two chapters, in&s;tead of contain|ing, as has been believed, one continued account of the Creation, written by Mo&s;es, contain two different and contradictory &s;tories of a creation, made by two different per&s;ons, and written in two differ|ent &s;tiles of expre&s;&s;ion. The evidence that &s;hews this, is &s;o clear when attended to without prejudice, that, did we meet with the &s;ame evidence in any Arabic or Chine&s;e account of a creation, we &s;hould not he&s;itate in pronouncing it a forgery.</P>
<P>I proceed to di&s;tingui&s;h the two &s;tories from each other.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tory begins at the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the fir&s;t chapter, and ends at the end of the third ver&s;e of the &s;econd chapter; for the adverbial conjunction, THUS, with which the &s;econd chapter begins, (as the reader will &s;ee) connects it&s;elf to the la&s;t ver&s;e of the fir&s;t chapter, and tho&s;e three ver&s;es belong to, and make the conclu&s;ion of, the fir&s;t &s;tory.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;tory begins at the fourth ver&s;e of the &s;econd chapter, and ends with that chapter. Tho&s;e two &s;tories have been confu&s;ed into one, by cutting off the three la&s;t ver&s;es of the fir&s;t &s;tory, and throwing them to the &s;econd chapter.</P>
<P>I go now to &s;hew that tho&s;e &s;tories have been written by two dif|ferent per&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">From the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the fir&s;t chapter, to the end of the third Ver&s;e of the &s;econd chapter, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch makes the whole of the fir&s;t &s;tory, the word GOD is u&s;ed without any epithet or additional word con|joined with it, as the reader will &s;ee; and this &s;tile of expre&s;&s;ion is invariably u&s;ed throughout the whole of this &s;tory, and is repeated no le&s;s than thirty five times, viz.
<Q>In the beginning GOD created the heavens, and the earth, and the &s;pirit of GOD moved on the face of the water, and GOD &s;aid, Let there be light, and GOD &s;aw the light, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>But immediately from the beginning of the fourth ver&s;e of the &s;econd chapter, where the &s;econd &s;tory begins, the &s;tile of expre&s;&s;ion is always the <HI>Lord God,</HI> and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is &s;tile of expre&s;&s;ion is invariably u&s;ed to the end of the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pter, and is repeated eleven times; in the one it is always GOD, and never the <HI>Lord-God,</HI> in the other it is always the <HI>Lord-God,</HI> and never GOD. The fir&s;t &s;tory contains thirty-four ver&s;es, and repeats the &s;ingle word GOD thirty-five times. The &s;e|cond &s;tory contains twenty two ver&s;es, and repeats the compound word <HI>Lord-God</HI> eleven times; this difference of &s;tile, &s;o often repeated, and &s;o uniformly continued, &s;hews, that tho&s;e two chapters, containing two different &s;tories, are written by different per&s;ons, it is the &s;ame in all the different edition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the bible, in all the languages I have &s;een.</P>
<P>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing thus &s;hewn from the difference of &s;tile, that tho&s;e two chapters divided, as they properly divide them&s;elves, at the end of the third ver&s;e of the &s;econd chap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, are the work of two different per|&s;ons, I co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to &s;hew from the contradictory matters they contain, that they cannot be the work of one per&s;on, and are two different &s;tories.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, unle&s;s the writer was a lunatic, without memory, that one and the &s;ame per&s;on could &s;ay, as is &s;aid in the 27 and 28 ver&s;es of the fir&s;t chapter&mdash;<Q>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him: male and female created he them, and God ble&s;&s;ed them, and God &s;aid unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and repleni&s;h the earth, and &s;ubdue it, and have dominion over the fi&s;h of the &s;ea, and over the fowls of the air, and over every living thing, that moveth on the face of the earth.</Q> It is, I &s;ay, impo&s;&s;ible, that the &s;ame per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, who &s;aid this, could afterwards &s;ay, as is &s;aid in the &s;econd chapter, ver. 5, <HI>and there was not a man to till the ground;</HI> and then proceed in the 7th ver&s;e to give another account of the making a man for the fir&s;t time, and afterwards of the making a woman out of his rib.</P>
<P>Again, one and the &s;ame per&s;on could not write, as is written in the 29th ver&s;e of the fir&s;t chapter; behold I (God) have given you every herb bearing &s;eed, which is on the face of all the earth; and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree bearing &s;eed, to you it &s;hall be for meat and afterwards &s;ay, as is &s;aid in the &s;econd chapter, that the Lord-God planted a tree in the mid&s;t of a garden, and forbad man to eat thereof.</P>
<P>Again, one and the &s;ame per&s;on could not &s;ay, <Q>Thus the heavens and the earth were fini&s;hed, and all the ho&s;t of them, and on the &s;eventh day God ended all his work, which he had made,</Q> and immediately
<PB N="11" REF="10">
after, &s;et the Creator to work again, to plant a garden, to make a man and a woman, &amp;c. as is done in the &s;econd chapter.</P>
<P>Here are evidently two different &s;tories contra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icting each other&mdash; According to the fir&s;t, the two &s;exes, the male and the female, were made at the &s;ame time. According to the &s;econd, they were made at different times. The man fir&s;t, the woman afterwards. Accord|ing to the fir&s;t &s;tory, they were to have dominion over all the earth. According to the &s;econd, their dominion was limited to a garden. How large a garden it could be, that one man and one woman could dre&s;s and keep in order, I leave to the pro&s;ecutor, the judge, the jury, and Mr. Er&s;kine, to determine.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of the talking &s;erpent, and its tete a tete with Eve: the doleful adventure, called the <HI>Fall of Man;</HI> and how he was turned out of this fine garden, and how the garden was afterwards locked up and guarded by a flaming &s;word, (if any one can tell what a flaming &s;word is) belong altogether to the &s;econd &s;tory. They have no con|nection with the fir&s;t &s;tory. According to the fir&s;t there was no gar|den of Eden; no forbidden tree: The &s;cene was the whole earth, and the fruit of all trees was allowed to be eaten.</P>
<P>In giving this example of the &s;trange &s;tate of the bible, it cannot be &s;aid I have gone out of my way to &s;eek it, for I have taken the be|ginning of the book; nor can it be &s;aid I have made more of it, than it makes of it&s;elf. That there are two &s;tories is as vi&s;ible to the eye, when attended to, as that there are two chapters, and that they have been written by different per&s;ons, nobody knows by whom. If this, then, is the &s;trange condition, the beginning of the bible is in, it leads to a ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion, that the other parts are no better, and con&s;e|quently it becomes every man's duty to examine the ca&s;e. I have done it for my&s;elf, and am &s;atisfied, that the bible is <HI>fabulous.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps I &s;hall be told in the cant-language of the day, as I have often been told by the bi&s;hop of Landaff and others, of the great and laudable pains, that many pious and learned men have taken to explain the ob&s;cure, and reconcile the contradictory, or as they &s;ay, the <HI>&s;eemingly contradictory</HI> pa&s;&s;ages of the bible. It is becau&s;e the bible needs &s;uch an undertaking, that is one of the fir&s;t cau&s;es to &s;u&s;pect it is NOT the word of God: this &s;ingle reflection, when carried home to the mind, is in it&s;elf a volume.</P>
<P>What! does not the Creator of the Univer&s;e, the Fountain of all Wi&s;dom, the Origin of all Science, the Author of all Knowledge, the God of Order and of Harmony, know how to write? When we contemplate the va&s;t oeconomy of the creation, when we behold the unerring regularity of the vi&s;ible &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, the perfection with which all its &s;everal parts revolve, and by corre&s;ponding a&s;&s;emblage, form a whole;&mdash;when we launch our eye into the boundle&s;s ocean of &s;pace, and &s;ee our&s;elves &s;urrounded by innumerable worlds, not one of which varies from its appointed place&mdash;when we trace the power of a Creator, from a mite to an elephant; from an atom to an univer&s;e; can we &s;uppo&s;e that the mind that could conceive &s;uch a de&s;ign, and
<PB N="12" REF="11">
the power that executed it with incomparable perfection, cannot write without incon&s;i&s;tence; or that a book &s;o written can be the work of &s;uch a power? The writings of Thomas Paine, even of Thomas Paine, need no commentator to explain, expound, derange, and re|arrange their &s;everal parts, to render them intelligible&mdash;he can relate a fact, or write an e&s;&s;ay, without forgetting in one page what he has written in another; certainly then, did the God of all perfection con|de&s;cend to write or dictate a book, that book would be as perfect as him&s;elf is perfect: The bible is not &s;o, and it is confe&s;&s;edly not &s;o, by the attempts to amend it.</P>
<P>Perhaps I &s;hall be told, that though I have produced one in&s;tance, I cannot produce another of equal force. One is &s;ufficient to call in que&s;tion the genuinene&s;s or authenticity of any book that pretends to be the word of God: for &s;uch a book would, as before &s;aid, be as per|fect as its author is perfect.</P>
<P>I will, however, advance only four chapters further into the book of Gene&s;is and produce another example that is &s;ufficient to invali|date the &s;tory to which it belongs.</P>
<P>We have all heard of Noah's Flood; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to think of the whole human race, men, women, children, and infants (ex|cept one family) deliberately drowning, without feeling a painful &s;en|&s;ation; that heart mu&s;t be a heart of flint that can contemplate &s;uch a &s;cene with tranquility. There is nothing in the ancient mythology, nor in the religion of any people we know of upon the globe, that re|cords a &s;entence of their God, or of their Gods, &s;o tremendou&s;ly &s;e|vere and mercile&s;s. If the &s;tory be not true, we bla&s;phemiou&s;ly di&s;|honour God by believing it, and &s;till more &s;o, in forcing, by laws and penalties, that belief upon others. I go now to &s;hew from the face of the &s;tory, that it carries the evidence of not being true.</P>
<P>I know not if the judge, the jury, and Mr. Er&s;kine, who tried and convicted Williams, ever read the bible, or know any thing of its contents, and therefore I will &s;tate the ca&s;e preci&s;ely:</P>
<P>There were no &s;uch people, as Jews or I&s;raelites, in the time that Noah is &s;aid to have lived, and con&s;equently, there was no &s;uch law as that which is called the Jewi&s;h or Mo&s;aic Law. It is, accord|ing to the bible, more than &s;ix hundred years from the time the flood is &s;aid to have happened, to the time of Mo&s;es, and con&s;equently the time the flood is &s;aid to have happened, was more than &s;ix hundred years prior to the law, called the Law of Mo&s;es, even admitting Mo&s;es to have been the giver of that law, of which there is great cau&s;e to doubt.</P>
<P>We have here two different epochs, or points of time; that of the flood, and that of the law of Mo&s;es; the former more than &s;ix hundred years prior to the latter. But the maker of the &s;tory of the flood, whoever he was, has betrayed him&s;elf by blundering, for he has re|ver&s;ed the order of the times. He has told the &s;tory, as if the law of Mo&s;es was prior to the flood; for he has made God to &s;ay to Noah, Gene&s;is, chap. vii. ver. 2, <Q>Of every clean bea&s;t, thou &s;halt take
<PB N="13" REF="12">
unto thee by &s;evens, male and his female, and of bea&s;ts that are <HI>not clean</HI> by two, the male and his female.</Q> This is the Mo&s;aic law, and could only be &s;aid after that law was given, not before: There was no &s;uch thing as bea&s;ts clean and unclean in the time of Noah&mdash;it is no where &s;aid, they were created &s;o. They were only <HI>declared</HI> to be &s;o, <HI>as meats,</HI> by the Mo&s;aic law, and that to the Jews only, and there were no &s;uch people as Jews in the time of Noah. This is the blundering condition in which this &s;trange &s;tory &s;tands.</P>
<P>When we reflect on a &s;entence, &s;o tremendou&s;ly &s;evere, as that of con&s;igning the whole human race, eight per&s;ons excepted, to de|liberate drowning; a &s;entence, which repre&s;ents the Creator, in a more mercile&s;s character than any of tho&s;e, whom we call Pagans, ever repre&s;ented the Creator to be, under the figure of any of their deities, we ought at lea&s;t to &s;u&s;pend our belief of it, on a compari&s;on of the beneficent character of the Creator, with the tremendous &s;everity of the &s;entence; but when we &s;ee the &s;tory told with &s;uch an evident contradiction of circum&s;tances, we ought to &s;et it down for nothing better than a Jewi&s;h fable, told by nobody knows whom, and nobody knows when.</P>
<P>It is a relief to the genuine and &s;en&s;ible &s;oul of man to find the &s;tory unfounded. It frees us from two painful &s;en&s;ations at once; that of having hard thoughts of the Creator, on account of the &s;everity of the &s;entence; and that of &s;ympathi&s;ing in the horrid tragedy of a drowning world. He who cannot feel the force of what I mean, is not, in my e&s;timation of character, worthy the name of a human being.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t &s;aid there is great cau&s;e to doubt, if the law, called the law of Mo&s;es, was given by Mo&s;es; the books, called books of Mo&s;es, which contain among other things, what is called the Mo&s;aic law, are put in front of the bible, in the manner of a con&s;titution, with a hi&s;tory annexed to it&punc; Had the&s;e books been written by Mo&s;es, they would undoubtedly have been the olde&s;t books in the bible, and entitled to be placed fir&s;t, and the law and the hi&s;tory they contain, would be frequently referred to in the books that follow; but this is not the ca&s;e. From the time of Othniel, the fir&s;t of the judges (Judges, chap. iii. ver. 9) to the end of the book of Judges, which contains a period of four hundred and ten years, this law, and tho&s;e books were not in practice, nor known among the Jews, nor are they &s;o much as alluded to throughout the whole of that period. And if the reader will examine the 22d and 23d chapters of 2d book of Kings, and 34th chapter 2d Chron. he will find, that no &s;uch law, nor any &s;uch books were known in the time of the Jewi&s;h monarchy, and that the Jews were Pagans during the whole of that time, and of their judges.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time the law, called the law of Mo&s;es, made its ap|pearance, was in the time of Jo&s;iah, about a thou&s;and years after Mo&s;es was dead, it is then &s;aid to have been found by accident. The account of this finding, or pretended finding, is given,
<PB N="14" REF="13">
2d Chron. chap. xxxiv. ver. 14, 15, 16, 18. <Q>Hilkiah the prie&s;t <HI>found</HI> the book of the law of the Lord, given by Mo&s;es, and Hilkiah an&s;wered, and &s;aid, to Shaphan the &s;cribe, I have found the book of the law in the hou&s;e of the Lord, and Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and Shaphan carried the book to the king, and Shaphan told the king.

<P>In con&s;equence of this finding, which much re&s;embles that of poor Chatterton finding manu&s;cript poems of Rowley the Monk in the Cathedral Church at Bri&s;tol, or the late finding manu&s;cripts of Shake&s;peare in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> old che&s;t, (two well known frauds) Jo&s;iah aboli&s;hed the Pagan religion of the Jews, ma&s;&s;acred all the Pagan prie&s;ts, though he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m&s;elf had been a Pagan, as the reader will &s;ee in the 23d chap. 2d Kings, and thus e&s;tabli&s;hed in blood, the law that is there called the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w of Mo&s;es, and in&s;tituted a pa&s;&s;over in com|memoration thereof.

It is therefore evident that the law, called the law of Mo&s;es, of which the Jews talk &s;o much, was promulgated and e&s;tabli&s;hed only in the latter time of the Jewi&s;h monarchy; and it is very remarkable, that no &s;ooner had they e&s;tabli&s;hed it than they were a de&s;troyed people, as if they were puni&s;hed for acting an impo&s;ition and affixing the name of the Lord to it, and ma&s;&s;acreing their former prie&s;ts under pretence of religion. The &s;um of the hi&s;tory of the Jews is this&mdash;they continued to be a nation about a thou&s;and years, they then e&s;tabli&s;hed a law which they called the <HI>law of the Lord given by Mo&s;es,</HI> and were de&s;troyed. This is not opinion but hi&s;torical evidence.</P>
<P>Levi, the Jew, who has written an an&s;wer to the <HI>Age of Rea&s;on,</HI> gives a &s;trange account of the law called the law of Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the &s;tory of the &s;un and moon &s;tanding &s;till, that the I&s;raelites might cut the throats of all their enemies, and hang all their kings, as told in Jo&s;hua, Chap. x. he &s;ays, <Q>There is al&s;o another proof of the reality of this miracle, which is the appeal that the author of the book of Jo&s;hua makes to the book of <HI>Ja&s;her, is not this written in the book of Ja&s;her.</HI> Hence continues Levi, it is manife&s;t that the book, commonly called the book of Ja&s;her exi&s;ted and was well known at the time the book of Jo&s;hua was
<PB N="15" REF="14">
written;</Q> and pray, Sir, continues Levi, <Q>what book do you think this was? <HI>why no other than the law of Mo&s;es;</HI></Q> Levi, like the bi&s;hop of Landaff and many other gue&s;s-work commentators, either forgets, or does not know, what there is in one part of the bible when he is giving his opinion upon another part.</P>
<P>I did not, however, expect to find &s;o much ignorance in a Jew with re&s;pect to the hi&s;tory of his nation, though I might not be &s;ur|pri&s;ed at it in a bi&s;hop. If Levi will look into the account given in the fir&s;t Chap. 2d book of Samuel, of the Amalakite &s;laying Saul and bringing the crown and bracelets to David, he will find the following recital, ver. 15, 17, 18, <Q>and David called one of the young men and &s;aid, go near and fall upon him (the Amalakite) and he &s;mote him that he died, and David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his &s;on; al&s;o he bad them teach the chil|dren the u&s;e of the bow; <HI>behold it is written in the book of Ja&s;her.</HI></Q> If the book of Ja&s;her were what Levi calls it, the law of Mo&s;es, writ|ten by Mo&s;es, it is not po&s;&s;ible that any thing that David &s;aid or did could be written in that law, &s;ince Mo&s;es died more than five hun|dred years before David was born; and on the other hand, admitting the book of Ja&s;her to be the law, called the law of Mo&s;es, that law mu&s;t have been written more than five hundred years after Mo&s;es was dead, or it could not relate any thing &s;aid or done by David. Levi may take which of the&s;e ca&s;es he plea&s;es, for both are again&s;t him.</P>
<P>I am not going, in the cour&s;e of this letter, to write a commen|tary on the bible. The two in&s;tances I have produced, and which are taken from the beginning of the bible, &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of examining it. It is a book that has been read more, and examined le&s;s, than any book that ever exi&s;ted. Had it come to us as an Arabic or Chine&s;e book, and &s;aid to have been a &s;acred book by the people from whom it came, no apology would have been made for the con|fu&s;ed and di&s;orderly &s;tate it is in. The tales it relates of the Creator would have been cen&s;ured, and our pity been excited for tho&s;e who believed them. We &s;hould have vindicated the goodne&s;s of God again&s;t &s;uch a book, and preached up the di&s;belief of it out of reve|rence to him. Why then do we not act as honorably by the Creator in the one ca&s;e, as we would do in the other. As a Chine&s;e book we would have examined it; ought we not then to examine it as a Jewi&s;h book? The Chine&s;e are a people who have all the appearance of far greater an iquity than the Jews, and in point of permanency, there is no compari&s;on. They are al&s;o a people of mild manners, and of good morals, except where they have been corrupted by European com|merce. Yet we take the word of a re&s;tle&s;s bloody-minded people, as the Jews of Pale&s;tine were, when we would reject the &s;ame authority from a better people. We ought to &s;ee it is habit and prejudice that have prevented people from examining the bible. Tho&s;e of the church of England call it holy, becau&s;e the Jews called it &s;o, and becau&s;e cu&s;tom and certain acts of parliament call it &s;o, and they read it from cu&s;tom. Di&s;&s;enters read it for the purpo&s;e of doctrinal con|trover&s;y,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
and are very fertile in di&s;coveries and inventions. But none of them read it for the pure purpo&s;e of information, and of rendering ju&s;|tice to the Creator by examining if the evidence it contains warrants the belief of its being what it is called. In&s;tead of doing this, they take it blindfolded, and will have it to be the word of God whether it be &s;o or not. For my own part, my belief in the perfection of the Deity, will not permit me to believe that a book &s;o manife&s;tly ob&s;cure, di&s;|orderly, and contradictory, can be his work. I can write a better book my&s;elf. This di&s;belief in me proceeds from my belief in the Creator. I cannot pin my faith upon the <HI>&s;ay &s;o</HI> of Hilkiah the prie&s;t, who &s;aid he found it, or any part of it, nor upon Shaphan the &s;cribe, nor upon any prie&s;t nor any &s;cribe, or man of the law of the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>As to acts of parliament, there are &s;ome that &s;ay, there are witches and wizzards; and the per&s;ons who made tho&s;e acts (it was in the time of James the Fir&s;t) made al&s;o &s;ome acts which call the bible the holy &s;criptures or word of God. But acts of parliament decide nothing with re&s;pect to God; and as the&s;e acts of parliament-makers were wrong with re&s;pect to witches and wizzards, they may al&s;o be wrong with re&s;pect to the book in que&s;tion. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary that the book be examined, it is our duty to examine i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and to &s;up|pre&s;s the right of examination is &s;inful in any government or in any judge or jury. The bible makes God to &s;ay to Mo&s;es, Deut. chap. vii. 2d ver. <Q>And when the Lord the God &s;hall deliver them before thee, thou &s;halt &s;mite them, and utterly de&s;troy them, thou &s;halt make no covenant with them, <HI>nor &s;hew mercy unto them.</HI></Q> Not all the prie&s;ts, nor &s;cribes, nor tribunals in the world, nor all the autho|rity of man, &s;hall make me believe that God ever gave &s;uch a <HI>Robe&s;perian precept</HI> as that of &s;hewing <HI>no mercy;</HI> and con&s;equently it is impo&s;&s;ible that I, or any per&s;on who believes as reverentially of the Creator as I do, can believe &s;uch a book to be the word of God.</P>
<P>There have been, and &s;till are, tho&s;e, who whil&s;t they <HI>profe&s;s</HI> to believe the bible to be the word of God affect to turn it into ridicule. Taking their profe&s;&s;ion and conduct together, they act bla&s;phemou&s;ly; becau&s;e they act as if <HI>God him&s;elf</HI> was not to be believed. The ca&s;e is exceedingly different with re&s;pect to the <HI>Age of Rea&s;on.</HI> That book is written to &s;hew from the bible it&s;elf, that there is abundant matter to &s;u&s;pect it is not the word of God, and that we have been impo&s;ed upon, fir&s;t by Jews, and afterwards by prie&s;ts and commentators.</P>
<P>Not one of tho&s;e who have attempted to write an&s;wers to the <HI>Age of Rea&s;on</HI> have taken the ground upon which only an an&s;wer could be written. The ca&s;e in que&s;tion is not upon any point of doctrine, but altogether upon a matter of fact. Is the book called the bible the word of God or is it not? If it can be proved to be &s;o, it ought to be believed as &s;uch; if not, it ought not to be believed as &s;uch. This is the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e. The <HI>Age of Rea&s;on</HI> produces evidence to &s;hew, and I have in this letter produced additional evidence, that it is <HI>not</HI> the word of God. Tho&s;e who take the contrary &s;ide, &s;hould
<PB N="17" REF="16">
prove that it is. But this they have not done nor attempted to do, and con&s;equently they have done nothing to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The pro&s;ecutors of Williams have &s;hrunk from the point as the an&s;werers have done. They have availed them&s;elves of prejudice in&s;tead of proof. If a writing was produced in a court of judica|ture, &s;aid to be the writing of a certain per&s;on, and upon the reality or non-reality of which, &s;ome matter at i&s;&s;ue depended, the point to be proved would be, that &s;uch writing was the writing of &s;uch per|&s;on. Or if the i&s;&s;ue depended upon certain words, which &s;ome cer|tain per&s;on was &s;aid to have &s;poken, the point to be proved would be, that &s;uch words were &s;poken by &s;uch per&s;on? and Mr. Er&s;kine would contend the ca&s;e upon this ground. A certain book is &s;aid to be the word of God, what is the proof that it is &s;o, for upon this the whole depends; and if it cannot be proved to be &s;o, the pro&s;ecution fails for want of evidence.</P>
<P>The pro&s;ecution again&s;t Williams charges him with publi&s;hing a book, entitled the <HI>Age of Rea&s;on,</HI> which, it &s;ays, is an impious bla&s;|phemous pamphlet, tending to ridicule and bring into contempt the holy &s;criptures. Nothing is more ea&s;y than to find abu&s;ive words, and Engli&s;h pro&s;ecutions are famous for this &s;pecies of vulgarity. The charge however is &s;ophi&s;tical; for the charge as growing out of the pamphlet &s;hould have &s;tated, not as it now &s;tates, to ridicule and bring into contempt the holy &s;criptures, but to &s;hew, that the books called the holy &s;criptures are not the holy &s;criptures. It is one thing if I ridicule a work as being written by a certain per&s;on; but it is quite a different thing, if I write to prove that &s;uch work was not written by &s;uch per&s;on. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, I attack the per&s;on through the work; in the other ca&s;e, I defend the honor of the per&s;on again&s;t the work. This is what the Age of Rea&s;on does, and con&s;equently the charge in the indictment is &s;ophi&s;tically &s;tated. Every one will admit, that if the bible be <HI>not</HI> the word of God, we err in believing it to be his word, and ought not to believe it. Certainly, then, the ground the pro&s;ecution &s;hould take, would be to prove that the bible is in fact what it is called. But this the pro&s;ecution has not done and cannot do.</P>
<P>In all ca&s;es the prior fact mu&s;t be proved, before the &s;ub&s;equent facts can be admitted in evidence. In a pro&s;ecution for adultery, the fact of marriage, which is the prior fact, mu&s;t be proved before the facts to prove adultery can be received. If the fact of marriage can|not be proved, adultery cannot be proved; and if the pro&s;ecution can|not prove the bible to be the word of God, the charge of bla&s;phemy is vi&s;ionary and groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>In Turkey they might prove, if the ca&s;e happened, that a certain book was bought of a certain book&s;eller, and that the &s;aid book was written again&s;t the koran. In Spain and Portugal they might prove, that a certain book was bought of a certain book&s;eller, and that the &s;aid book was written again&s;t the infallibility of the pope. Under the ancient mythology they might have proved, that a certain writing
<PB N="18" REF="17">
was bought of a certain per&s;on, and that the &s;aid writing was written again&s;t the belief of a plurality of gods, and in the &s;upport of the belief of one God: Socrates was condemned for a work of this kind.</P>
<P>All the&s;e are but &s;ub&s;equent facts and amount to nothing, unle&s;s the prior facts be proved. The prior fact with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t ca&s;e is, Is the <HI>koran</HI> the word of God? with re&s;pect to the &s;econd, Is the infallibility of the pope a truth? with re&s;pect to the third, Is the belief of a plurality of gods a true belief? and in like manner with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent pro&s;ecution, Is the book called the <HI>bible</HI> the word of God? If the pre&s;ent pro&s;ecution prove no more than could be proved in any or all of the&s;e ca&s;es, it proves only as they do, or as an inqui&s;ition would prove; and, in this view of the ca&s;e, the pro&s;ecutors ought at lea&s;t to leave off reviling that infernal in&s;titu|tion, the inqui&s;ition. The pro&s;ecution, however, though it may injure the individual may promote the cau&s;e of truth; becau&s;e the manner in which it has been conducted appears a confe&s;&s;ion to the world, that there is no evidence to prove that the bible is the word of God. On what authority then do we believe the many &s;trange &s;tories that the bible tells of God.</P>
<P>This pro&s;ecution has been carried on through the medium of what is called a &s;pecial jury, and the whole of a &s;pecial jury is nominated by t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e ma&s;ter of the crown office.

But if in crown pro&s;ecutions the ma&s;ter of the crown offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e is to continue to appoint the whole &s;pecial jury, which he does by nominating the forty-eight per&s;ons from which the &s;olicitor of each party is to &s;trike out twelve, Mr. Er&s;kine's bill is only vapour and &s;moke. The root of the grievance lies in the manner of forming the jury, and to this Mr. Er&s;kine's bill applies no remedy.</P>
<P>When the trial of Williams came on, only eleven of the &s;pecial jurymen appeared, and the trial was adjourned. In ca&s;es where the whole number do not appear, it is cu&s;tomary to make up the deficiency by taking jurymen from per&s;ons pre&s;ent in court. This, in the law term, is called a <HI>Tales.</HI> Why was not this done in this ca&s;e? Rea&s;on will &s;ugge&s;t, that they did not chu&s;e to depend on a man accidentally taken. When the trial recommenced the whole of the &s;pecial jury ap|peared, and Williams was convicted: It is folly to contend a cau&s;e where the whole jury is nominated by one of the parties. I will relate a recent ca&s;e that explains a great deal with re&s;pect to &s;pecial juries in crown pro&s;ecutions.</P>
<P>On the trial of Lambert and others, printers and proprietors of the Morning Chronicle, for a libel, a &s;pecial jury was &s;truck on the prayer of the attorney-general, who u&s;ed to be called Diabolus Regis or King's Devil.</P>
<P>Only &s;even or eight of the &s;pecial jury appeared, and the attorney-general not praying a <HI>Tales,</HI> the trial &s;tood over to a future day, when it was to be brought on a &s;econd time, the attorney-general prayed
<PB N="19" REF="18">
for a new &s;pecial jury, but as this was not admi&s;&s;ible, the original &s;pecial jury was &s;ummoned. Only eight of them appeared, on which the attorney-general &s;aid, as I cannot, on a &s;econd trial, have a &s;pecial jury, I will pray a <HI>Tales.</HI> Four per&s;ons were then taken from per&s;ons pre&s;ent in court, and added to the eight &s;pecial jurymen. The jury went out at two o'clock to con&s;ult on their verdict, and the judge (Kenyon) under&s;tanding they were divided, and likely to be &s;ome time in making up their minds, retired from the bench, and went home. At &s;even, the jury went, attended by an officer of the court, to the judge's hou&s;e, and delivered a verdict,
<Q>Guilty of pub|li&s;hing, but with no malicious intention.</Q>
The judge &s;aid,
<Q>I can|not record this verdict; it is no verdict at all.</Q>
The jury withdrew, and after &s;etting in con&s;ultation till five in the morning, brought in a verdict, NOT GUILTY. Would this have been the ca&s;e, had they been all &s;pecial jurymen nominated by the ma&s;ter of the crown-office? This is one of the ca&s;es that ought to open the eyes of people with re&s;pect to the manner of forming &s;pecial juries.</P>
<P>On the trial of Williams, the judge prevented the coun&s;el for the defendant proceeding in the defence. The pro&s;ecution had &s;elected a number of pa&s;&s;ages from the Age of Rea&s;on, and in&s;erted them in the indictment. The defending coun&s;el was &s;electing other pa&s;&s;ages to &s;hew, that the pa&s;&s;ages in the indictment were conclu&s;ions drawn from premi&s;es, and unfairly &s;eparated therefrom in the indictment. The judge &s;aid, <HI>he did not know how to act;</HI> meaning thereby, whether to let the coun&s;el proceed in the defence or not; and a&s;ked the jury, if they wi&s;hed to hear the pa&s;&s;ages read which the defending coun&s;el had &s;elected. The jury &s;aid, NO, and the defending coun&s;el was in con&s;equence &s;ilence. Mr. Erskine then, Fal&s;taff-like, having all the field to him&s;elf, and no enemy at hand, laid about him mo&s;t heroicly, and the jury found the defendant <HI>guilty.</HI> I know not if Mr. Erskine ran out of court and hallooed, huzza for the bible and the trial by jury.</P>
<P>Robe&s;piere cau&s;ed a decree to be pa&s;&s;ed during the trial of Bri&s;&s;ot and others, that after a trial had la&s;ted three days, (the whole of which time, in the ca&s;e of Bri&s;&s;ot, was taken up by the pro&s;ecuting party) the judge &s;hould ask the jury (who were then a packed jury) if they were &s;atisfied? If the jury &s;aid YES, the trial ended, and the jury proceeded to give their verdict, without hearing the defence of the accu&s;ed party. It needs no depth of wi&s;dom to make an application of this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I will now &s;tate a ca&s;e to &s;hew, that the trial of Williams is not a trial according to Kenyon's own explanation of law.</P>
<P>On a late trial in London (Selthens, ver&s;us Hoo&s;&s;man) on a policy of in&s;urance, one of the jurymen, Mr. Dunnage, after hearing one &s;ide of the ca&s;e, and without hearing the other &s;ide, got up and &s;aid, <HI>it was as legal a policy of in&s;urance as ever was written.</HI> The judge, who was the &s;ame as pre&s;ided on the trial of Williams, replied, <HI>that it was a great misfortune when any gentleman of the jury makes up his mind
<PB N="20" REF="19">
on a cau&s;e before it was fini&s;hed.</HI> Mr. Erskine, who in that ca&s;e was coun&s;el for the defendant; (in this, he was again&s;t the defendant) cried out, <HI>it is wor&s;e than a misfortune, it is a fault.</HI> The judge in his ad|dre&s;s to the jury, in &s;umming up the evidence, expatiated upon, and explained the parts, which the law a&s;&s;igned to the coun&s;el on each &s;ide, to the witne&s;&s;es, and to the judge, and &s;aid,
<Q>When all this was done, <HI>AND NOT UNTIL THEN,</HI> it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the jury to declare what the ju&s;tice of the ca&s;e was; and that it was extremely ra&s;h and imprudent in any man to draw a conclu&s;ion before all the pre|mi&s;es were laid before them, upon which that conclu&s;ion was to be grounded.</Q>&mdash;According then to Kenyon's own doctrine, the trial of Williams is an irregular trial, the verdict an irregular verdict, and as &s;uch, is not recordable.</P>
<P>As to &s;pecial juries, they are but modern; and were in&s;tituted for the purpo&s;e of determining ca&s;es at <HI>law</HI> between merchants; becau&s;e, as the method of keeping merchants accounts differs from that of com|mon trade&s;men, and their bu&s;ine&s;s by lying much in foreign bills of exchange, in&s;urances, &amp;c. is of a different de&s;cription to that of com|mon trade&s;men, it might happen that a common jury might not be competent to form a judgment. The law that in&s;tituted &s;pecial juries makes it nece&s;&s;ary that the jurors be <HI>merchants,</HI> or of the degree of <HI>&s;quires.</HI> A &s;pecial jury in London is generally compo&s;ed of merchants; and in the country of men called country &s;quires, that is, fox-hunters, or men qualified to hunt foxes. The one may decide very well upon a ca&s;e of pounds, &s;hillings, and pence, or of the counting-hou&s;e; and the other of the jockey-club or the chace. But who would not laugh, that becau&s;e &s;uch men can decide &s;uch ca&s;es, they can al&s;o be jurors upon theology. Talk with &s;ome London merchants about &s;cripture, and they will under&s;tand you mean <HI>&s;crip,</HI> and tell you how much it is worth at the Stock Exchange. Ask them about theology, and they will &s;ay, they know of no &s;uch gentleman upon Change. Tell &s;ome country &s;quires of the &s;un and moon &s;tanding &s;till, the one on the top of a hill, and the other in a valley, and they will &s;wear it is a lie of one's own making. Tell them that God-Almighty ordered a man to make a cake and bake it with a t&mdash;d and eat it, and they will &s;ay, it is one of Dean Swift's blackguard &s;tories. Tell them it is in the bible, and they will lay a bowl of punch it is not, and leave it to the par&s;on of the pari&s;h to decide. Ask <HI>them</HI> al&s;o about theology, and they will &s;ay, they know of no &s;uch a one on the turf. An appeal to &s;uch juries, &s;erves to bring the bible into more ridicule than any thing the author of the Age of Rea&s;on has written; and the manner in which the trial has been conducted, &s;hews, that the pro&s;ecutor dares not come to the point, nor meet the defence of the defendant. But all other ca&s;es apart, on what ground of right, otherwi&s;e than on the right a&s;&s;umed by an inqui&s;ition, do &s;uch pro&s;ecutions &s;tand. Religion is a private affair between every man and his Maker, and no tribunal or third party has a right to interfere between them. It is not pro|perly a thing of this world; it is only practi&s;ed in this world; but
<PB N="21" REF="20">
its object is in a future world; and it is no otherwi&s;e an object of ju&s;t laws than for the purpo&s;e of protecting the equal rights of all, however various their beliefs may be. If one man chu&s;e to believe the book called the bible to be the word of God; and another, from a con|vinced idea of the purity and perfection of God, compared with the contradictions the book contains; from the la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ome of its &s;tories, like that of Lot getting drunk and debauching his two daughters, which is not &s;poken of as a crime, and for which the mo&s;t ab&s;urd apologies are made; from the immorality of &s;ome of its pre|cepts, like that of &s;hewing no mercy; and from the total want of evidence on the ca&s;e, thinks he ought not to believe it to be the word of God: each of them has an equal right; and if the one has a right to give his rea&s;ons for believing it to be &s;o, the other has an equal right to give his rea&s;ons for believing the <HI>contrary.</HI> Any thing that goes beyond this rule is an inqui&s;ition. Mr. Erskine talks of his moral education; Mr. Erskine is very little acquainted with theologi|cal &s;ubjects, if he does not know there is &s;uch a thing as a <HI>&s;incere</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> belief that the bible is not the word of God. This is my be|lief; it is the belief of thou&s;ands far more learned than Mr. Erskine; and is a belief that is every day increa&s;ing. It is not infidelity, as Mr. Erskine prophanely and abu&s;ively calls it: it is the direct rever&s;e of infidelity. It is a pure religious belief, founded on the idea of the perfection of the Creator. If the bible be the word of God, it needs not the wretched aid of pro&s;ecutions to &s;upport it; and you might with as much propriety make a law to protect the &s;un&s;hine as to pro|tect the bible, if the bible, like the &s;un, be the work of God. We &s;ee that God takes good care of the Creation he has made. He &s;uffers no part of it to be extingui&s;hed; and he will take the &s;ame care of his word, if he ever gave <HI>one.</HI> But men ought to be reverentially careful and &s;u&s;picious how they a&s;cribe books to him as his <HI>word,</HI> which from this confu&s;ed condition, would di&s;honour a common &s;cribbler, and again&s;t which there is abundant evidence, and every cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect impo&s;ition. Leave then the bible to it&s;elf. God will take care of it if he has any thing to do with it, as he takes care of the &s;un and the moon, which need not your laws for their better pro|tection. As the two in&s;tances I have produced in the beginning of this letter, from the book of Gene&s;is, the one re&s;pecting the account called the Mo&s;aic account of the Creation; the other of the flood, &s;ufficiently &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of examining the bible, in order to a&s;certain what degree of evidence there is for receiving or rejecting it as a &s;acred book. I &s;hall not add more upon that &s;ubject; but in order to &s;hew Mr. Erskine that there are religious e&s;tabli&s;hments for public wor&s;hip which make no profe&s;&s;ion of faith of the books called the holy &s;criptures, nor admit of prie&s;ts, I will conclude with an account of a &s;ociety lately began in Paris, and which is very rapidly extending it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;ociety takes the name of Theophilantropes, which would be rendered in Engli&s;h by the word Theophilanthropi&s;ts, word com|pounded

<P><HI>INTRODUCTION,</HI> ENTITLED, PRECISE HISTORY OF THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>Towards the month of Vendimiaire, of the year 5, (Sept. 1796) there appeared at Paris, a &s;mall work, entitled, Manuel of the Theoantropophiles, &s;ince called, for the &s;ake of ea&s;ier pronunciation, Theophilantropes (Theophilanthropi&s;ts) publi&s;hed by C &mdash;.</P>
<P>The wor&s;hip &s;et forth in this Manuel, of which the origin is from the beginning of the world, was then profe&s;&s;ed by &s;ome families in the &s;ilence of dome&s;tic life. But &s;carcely was the Manuel pub|li&s;hed, than &s;ome per&s;ons, re&s;pectable for their knowledge and their manners, &s;aw, in the formation of a &s;ociety open to the public, an ea&s;y method of &s;preading moral religion, and of leading by degrees, great numbers to the knowledge thereof, who appear to have for|gotten it. This con&s;ideration ought of it&s;elf not to leave indifferent tho&s;e per&s;ons who know that morality and religion, which is the mo&s;t &s;olid &s;upport thereof, are nece&s;&s;ary to the maintenance of &s;ociety as well as to the happine&s;s of the individual. The&s;e con&s;iderations deter|mined the families of the Theophilantropi&s;ts to unite publicly for the exerci&s;e of their wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ociety of this kind opened in the month of Nivo&s;e, year 5, (Jan. 1797,) in the &s;treet Denis, No. 34, corner of Lom|bard-&s;treet. The care of conducting this &s;ociety was undertaken by five fathers of families. They adopted the Manuel of the Theophilan|thropi&s;ts. They agreed to hold their days of public wor&s;hip on the days corre&s;ponding to Sundays, but without making this a hindrance to other &s;ocieties to chu&s;e &s;uch other day as they thought more con|venient. Soon after this more &s;ocieties were opened, of which &s;ome celebrate <HI>on</HI> the decadi (tenth day) and others <HI>on</HI> the Sunday: It was al&s;o re&s;olved, that the committee &s;hould meet one hour each week for the purpo&s;e of preparing or examining the di&s;cour&s;es and lectures pro|po&s;ed for the next general a&s;&s;embly. That the general a&s;&s;emblies &s;hould be called Fetes (fe&s;tivals) religious and moral. That tho&s;e
<PB N="24" REF="23">
fe&s;tivals &s;hould be conducted in principle and form, in a manner, as not to be con&s;idered as the fe&s;tivals of an exclu&s;ive wor&s;hip; and that in recalling tho&s;e who might not be attached to any particular wor|&s;hip, tho&s;e fe&s;tivals might al&s;o be attended as moral exerci&s;es by di&s;|ciples of every &s;ect, and con&s;equently avoid, by &s;crupulous care, every thing that might make the &s;ociety appear under the name of a &s;ect. The &s;ociety adopts neither <HI>rites</HI> nor <HI>prie&s;thood,</HI> and it will never lo&s;e &s;ight of the re&s;olution not to advance any thing as a &s;ociety incon|venient to any &s;ect or &s;ects, in any time or country, and under any government.</P>
<P>It will be &s;een that it is &s;o much the more ea&s;y for the &s;ociety to keep within this circle, becau&s;e, that the dogmas of the Theophilan|thropi&s;ts are tho&s;e upon which all the &s;ects have agreed, that their moral is that upon which there has never been the lea&s;t di&s;&s;ent; and that the name they have taken expre&s;&s;es the double end of all the &s;ects, that of leading to the <HI>adoration of God and love of man.</HI></P>
<P>The Theophilantropi&s;ts do not call them&s;elves the di&s;ciples of &s;uch or &s;uch a man. They avail them&s;elves of the wi&s;e precepts that have been tran&s;mitted by writers of all countries and in all ages. The reader will find in the di&s;cour&s;es, lectures, hymns, and canticles, which the Theophilanthropi&s;ts have adopted for their religious and moral fe&s;tivals, and which they pre&s;ent under the title of Arm&eacute;e Religieu&s;e, extracts from morali&s;ts, ancient and modern, dive&s;ted of maxims too &s;evere, or too loo&s;ely conceived, or contrary to piety, whether towards God or towards man.</P></Q>
<P>Next follow the dogmas of the Theophilanthropi&s;ts or things they profe&s;s to believe. The&s;e are but two, and are thus expre&s;&s;ed, les Theophilantropes croient &agrave; l'exi&s;tence de dieu et a l'immortalite de l'ame. The Theophilanthropi&s;ts believe in the exi&s;tence of God, and the immortality of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>The manuel of the Theophilanthropi&s;ts, a &s;mall volume of &s;ixty pages, duodecimo, is publi&s;hed &s;eparately, as is al&s;o their catechi&s;m, which is of the &s;ame &s;ize. The principles of the Theophilanthropi&s;ts are the &s;ame as tho&s;e publi&s;hed in the fir&s;t part of the Age of Rea&s;on in 1793, and in the &s;econd part in 1795. The Theophilanthropi&s;ts as a &s;ociety are &s;ilent upon all the things they do not profe&s;s to believe, as the <HI>&s;acredne&s;s</HI> of the books called the bible, &amp;c. &amp;c. They pro|fe&s;s the immortality of the &s;oul, but they are &s;ilent on the immortality of the body, or that which the church calls the re&s;urrection. The author of the <HI>Age of Rea&s;on</HI> gives rea&s;ons for every thing he <HI>di&s;believes</HI> as well as for tho&s;e he <HI>believes;</HI> and where this cannot be done with &s;afety, the government is a de&s;poti&s;m, and the church an inqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>It is more than three years &s;ince the fir&s;t part of the Age of Rea&s;on was publi&s;hed, and more than a year and half &s;ince the publication of the &s;econd part. The bi&s;hop of Landaff undertook to write an an&s;wer to the &s;econd part; and it was not until after it was known that the author of the Age of Rea&s;on would reply to the bi&s;hop, that
<PB N="25" REF="24">
the pro&s;ecution again&s;t the book was &s;et on foot; and which is &s;aid to be carried on by &s;ome clergy of the Engli&s;h church. If the bi&s;hop is one of them, and the object be to prevent an expo&s;ure of the numerous and gro&s;s errors he has committed in his work (and which he wrote when report &s;aid that Thomas Paine was dead) it is a confe&s;&s;ion that he feels the weakne&s;s of his cau&s;e, and finds him&s;elf unable to maintain it. In this ca&s;e, he has given me a triumph I did not &s;eek, and Mr. Erskine, the herald of the pro&s;ecution, has proclaimed it.</P>

<P>RELIGION has two principal enemies, Fanatici&s;m and Infidelity, or that which is called Athei&s;m. The fir&s;t requires to be combated by rea&s;on and morality, the other by natural philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of a God is the fir&s;t dogma of the Theophilanthro|pi&s;ts. It is upon this &s;ubject that I &s;olicit your attention: for though it has been often treated of, and that mo&s;t &s;ublimely, the &s;ubject is inexhau&s;tible; and there will always remain &s;omething to be &s;aid that has not been before advanced. I go therefore to open the &s;ubject, and to crave your attention to the end.</P>
<P>The univer&s;e is the bible of a true Theophilanthropi&s;t. It is there that he reads of God. It is there that the proofs of his exi&s;tence are to be &s;ought and to be found. As to written or printed books, by whatever name they are called, they are the works of man's hands, and carry no evidence in them&s;elves that God is the author of any of them. It mu&s;t be in &s;omething that man could not make, that we mu&s;t &s;eek evidence for our belief, and that &s;omething is the univer&s;e; the true bible; the inimitable word of God.</P>
<P>Contemplating the univer&s;e, the whole &s;y&s;tem of creation, in this point of light, we &s;hall di&s;cover, that all that which is called natural philo&s;ophy is properly a divine &s;tudy&mdash;It is the &s;tudy of God through his works&mdash;It is the be&s;t &s;tudy, by which we can arrive at a knowledge of his exi&s;tence, and the only one by which we can gain a glimp&s;e of his perfection.</P>
<P>Do we want to contemplate his power? we &s;ee it in the immen&s;ity of the Creation. Do we want to contemplate his wi&s;dom? We &s;ee it in the unchangeable order by which the incomprehen&s;ible WHOLE it governed. Do we want to contemplate his munificence? We &s;ee it in the abundance with which he fills the earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We &s;ee it in his not with-holding that abundance even from the unthankful. In fine, do we want to know what God is? Search not written or printed books, but the &s;cripture called the <HI>Creation.</HI></P>
<P>It has been the error of the &s;chools to teach a&s;tronomy, and all the other &s;ciences, and &s;ubjects of natural philo&s;ophy, as accompli&s;hments
<PB N="27" REF="26">
only; whereas they &s;hould be taught theologically, or with reference to the Being who is the author of them; for all the principles of &s;cience are of Divine origin. Man cannot make, or invent, or con|trive principles. He can only di&s;cover them; and he ought to look through the di&s;covery to the author.</P>
<P>When we examine an extraordinary piece of machinery, an a&s;ton|i&s;hing pile of architecture, a well executed &s;tatue, or an highly fini&s;hed painting, where life and action are imitated, and habit only pre|vents our mi&s;taking a &s;urface of light and &s;hade for cubical &s;olidity, our ideas are naturally led to think of the exten&s;ive genius and talents of the arti&s;t. When we &s;tudy elements of geometry, we think of Euclid. When we &s;peak of gravitation, we think of Newton. How then is it, that when we &s;tudy the works of God in the Creation, we &s;top &s;hort and do not think of God? It is from the error of the &s;chools in having taught tho&s;e &s;ubjects as accompli&s;hments only, and thereby &s;eparated the &s;tudy of them from the Being who is the author of them.</P>
<P>The &s;chools have made the &s;tudy of theology to con&s;i&s;t in the &s;tudy of opinions in written or printed books; whereas theology &s;hould be &s;tudied in the works or book of the creation. The &s;tudy of theology in books of opinions has often produced fanatici&s;m, rancour, and cruelty of temper; and from hence have proceeded the numerous per&s;ecutions, the fanatical quarrels, the religious burnings and ma&s;&s;a|cres, that have de&s;olated Europe. But the &s;tudy of theology in the works of the creation produces a direct contrary effect. The mind becomes at once enlightened and &s;erene; a copy of the &s;cene it beholds; in|formation and adoration go hand in hand; and all the &s;ocial faculties become enlarged.</P>
<P>The evil that has re&s;ulted from the error of the &s;chools, in teach|ing natural philo&s;ophy as an accompli&s;hment only, has been that of generating in the pupils a &s;pecies of Athei&s;m. In&s;tead of looking through the works of Creation to the Creator him&s;elf, they &s;top &s;hort, and employ the knowledge they acquire to create doubts of his ex|i&s;tence. They labour, with &s;tudied ingenuity, to a&s;cribe every thing they behold to inmate properties of matter; and jump over all the re&s;t by &s;aying, that matter is eternal.</P>
<P>Let us examine this &s;ubject; it is worth examining; for if we ex|amine it through all its ca&s;es, the re&s;ult will be, that the exi&s;tence of a &s;uperior cau&s;e, or that which man calls God, will be di&s;coverable by philo&s;ophical principles.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, admitting matter to have properties, as we &s;ee it has, the que&s;tion &s;till remains, how came matter by tho&s;e proper|ties? To this they will an&s;wer, that matter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e proper|ties eternally. This is not &s;olution, but a&s;&s;ertion; and to deny it is equally as impo&s;&s;ible of proof as to a&s;&s;ert it. It is then nece&s;&s;ary to go further, and therefore I &s;ay,&mdash;if there exi&s;t a circum&s;tance that is <HI>not</HI> a property of matter, and without which the univer&s;e, or to &s;peak in a limited degree, the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, compo&s;ed of planets and a &s;un,
<PB N="28" REF="27">
could not exi&s;t a moment; all the arguments of Athei&s;m, drawn from properties of matter, and applied to account for the univer&s;e, will be overthrown, and the exi&s;tence of a &s;uperior cau&s;e, or that which man calls God, becomes di&s;coverable, as is before &s;aid, by natural philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>I go now to &s;hew that &s;uch a circum&s;tance exi&s;ts, and what it is:</P>
<P>The univer&s;e is compo&s;ed of matter, and, as a &s;y&s;tem, is &s;u&s;tained by motion. Motion is <HI>not a property</HI> of matter, and without this motion the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem could not exi&s;t. Were motion a property of matter, that undi&s;covered and undi&s;coverable thing called perpetual motion would e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf. It is becau&s;e motion is not a property of matter, that perpetual motion is an impo&s;&s;ibility in the hand of every being but that of the Creator of motion. When the pretenders to Athei&s;m can produce perpetual motion, and not till then, they may ex|pect to be credited</P>
<P>The natural &s;tate of matter, as to place, is a &s;tate of re&s;t. Motion, or change of place, is the effect of an external cau&s;e acting upon matter. As to that faculty of matter that is called gravitation, it is the influence which two or more bodies have reciprocally on each other to unite and be at re&s;t. Every thing which has hitherto been di&s;covered with re&s;pect to the motion of the planets in the &s;y&s;tem, re|lates only to the laws by which motion acts, and not to the cau&s;e of motion. Gravitation, &s;o far from being the cau&s;e of motion to the planets that compo&s;e the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, would be the de&s;truction of the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, were revolutionary motion to cea&s;e; for as the action of &s;pinning upholds a top, the revolutionary motion upholds the planets in their orbits, and prevents them from gravitating and forming one ma&s;s with the &s;un. In one &s;en&s;e of the word, philo&s;ophy knows, and athei&s;m, &s;ays, that matter is in perpetual motion. But the motion here meant refers to the <HI>&s;tate</HI> of matter, and that only on the &s;urface of the earth. It is either decompo&s;ition, which is continually de&s;troy|ing the form of bodies of matter, or recompo&s;ition, which renews that matter in the &s;ame or another form, as the decompo&s;ition of animal&punc; or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances enter into the compo&s;ition of other bodies. But the motion that upholds the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem is of an entire different kind, and is not a property of matter. It operates al&s;o to an entire different effect. It operates to <HI>perpetual pre&s;ervation,</HI> and to prevent <HI>any change</HI> in the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Giving then to matter all the properties which philo&s;ophy knows it has, or all that athei&s;m a&s;cribes to it, and can prove, and even &s;uppo&s;ing matter to be eternal, it will not account for the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e or of the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, becau&s;e it will not account for motion, and it is motion that pre&s;erves it. When, therefore, we di&s;cover a circum&s;tance of &s;uch immen&s;e importance, that without it the univer&s;e could not exi&s;t, and for which neither matter, nor any, nor all, the properties of matter can account; we are by nece&s;&s;ity forced into the rational and comfortable belief of the exi&s;tence of a cau&s;e &s;uperior to matter, and that cau&s;e man calls GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">As to that which is called nature, it is no other than the laws by which motion and action of every kind, with re&s;pect to unintelligible matter, is regulated. And when we &s;peak of looking through nature up to nature's God, we &s;peak philo&s;ophically the &s;ame rational lan|guage as when we &s;peak of looking through human law up to the power that ordained them.</P>
<P>God is the power or fir&s;t cau&s;e, nature is the law, and matter is the &s;ubject acted upon.</P>
<P>But infidelity by a&s;cribing every phaenomenon to properties of mat|ter, conceives a &s;y&s;tem for which it cannot account, and yet it pretends to demon&s;tration. It rea&s;ons from what it &s;ees on the &s;urface of the earth, but it does not carry it&s;elf on the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem exi&s;ting by motion. It &s;ees upon the &s;urface a perpetual decompo&s;ition and re|compo&s;ition of matter. It &s;ees that an oak produces an acorn, an acorn an oak, a bird an egg, an egg a bird, and &s;o on. In things of this kind it &s;ees &s;omething which it calls a natural cau&s;e, but none of the cau&s;es it &s;ees is the cau&s;e of that motion which pre&s;erves the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Let us contemplate this wonderful and &s;tupendous &s;y&s;tem con&s;i&s;ting of matter and exi&s;ting by motion. It is not matter in a &s;tate of re&s;t, nor in a &s;tate of decompo&s;ition or recompo&s;ition. It is matter &s;y&s;tematized in perpetual orbicular or circular motion. As a &s;y&s;tem that motion is the life of it: as animation is life to an animal body, deprive the &s;y&s;tem of motion, and, as a &s;y&s;tem, it mu&s;t expire. Who then breathed into the &s;y&s;tem the life of motion? What power im|pelled the planets to move &s;ince motion is not a property of the mat|ter of which they are compo&s;ed? If we contemplate the immen&s;e velocity of this motion, our wonder becomes increa&s;ed, and our adoration enlarges it&s;elf in the &s;ame proportion. To in&s;tance only one of the planets, that of the earth we inhabit, its di&s;tance from the &s;un, the centre of the orbits of all the planets, is, according to ob&s;er|vations of the tran&s;it of the planet Venus, about one hundred million miles; con&s;equently the diameter of the orbit or circle in which the earth moves round the &s;un is double that di&s;tance; and the mea&s;ure of the circumference of the orbit, taken as three times its diameter, is &s;ix hundred million miles. The earth performs this voyage in 365 days and &s;ome hours, and con&s;equently moves at the rate of more than one million &s;ix hundred thou&s;and miles every twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>Where will infidelity, where will athei&s;m, find cau&s;e for this a&s;toni&s;hing velocity of motion, never cea&s;ing, never varying, and which is the pre&s;ervation of the earth in its orbit? It is not by rea|&s;oning from an acorn to an oak, from an egg to a bird, or from any change in the &s;tate of matter on the &s;urface of the earth, that this can be accounted for. Its cau&s;e is not to be found in matter nor in any thing we call nature. The athei&s;t who affects to rea&s;on, and the fanatic who rejects rea&s;on, plunge them&s;elves alike into inextricable difficulties. The one perverts the &s;ublime and enlightening &s;tudy of natural philo&s;ophy into a deformity of ab&s;urdities by not rea&s;oning to
<PB N="30" REF="29">
the end. The other lo&s;es him&s;elf in the ob&s;curity of metaphy&s;ical theories, and di&s;honours the Creator, by treating the &s;tudy of his works with contempt. The one is a half-rational of whom there is &s;ome hope, the other a vi&s;ionary to whom we mu&s;t be charitable.</P>
<P>When at fir&s;t thought we think of a Creator, our ideas appear to us undefined and confu&s;ed; but if we rea&s;on philo&s;ophically, tho&s;e ideas can be ea&s;ily arranged and &s;implified. <HI>It is a Being who&s;e power is equal to his will.</HI> Ob&s;erve the nature of the will of man. It is of an infinite quality. We cannot conceive the po&s;&s;ibility of limits to the will. Ob&s;erve, on the other hand, how exceedingly limited is his power of acting compared with the nature of his will. Suppo&s;e the power equal to the will and man would be a God. He would will him&s;elf eternal, and be &s;o. He could will a creation and could make it. In this progre&s;&s;ive rea&s;oning, we &s;ee, in the nature of the will of man, half of that which we conceive in thinking of God, add the other half and we have the whole idea of a being who could make the univer&s;e, and &s;u&s;tain it by perpetual motion; becau&s;e he could create that motion.</P>
<P>We know nothing of the capacity of the will of animals; but we know a great deal of the difference of their powers. For example, how numerous are the degrees, and how immen&s;e is the difference of power, from a mite to a man. Since then every thing we &s;ee below us &s;hews a progre&s;&s;ion of power, where is the difficulty in &s;uppo&s;ing that there is at the <HI>&s;ummit of all things</HI> a Being in whom an infinity of power unites with the infinity of the will. When this &s;imple idea pre&s;ents it&s;elf to our mind we have the idea of a perfect being that man calls God.</P>
<P>It is comfortable to live under the belief of the exi&s;tence of an infi|nitely protecting power; and it is an addition to that comfort to know, that &s;uch a belief is not a mere conceit of the imagination, as many of the theories that are called religious are; nor a belief founded only on tradition or received opinion, but is a belief deducible by the action of rea&s;on upon the things that compo&s;e the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e; a belief ari&s;ing out of vi&s;ible facts, and &s;o demon&s;trable is the truth of this belief, that if no &s;uch belief had exi&s;ted the per|&s;ons who now controvert it, would have been the per&s;ons who would have produced and propagated it; becau&s;e, by beginning to rea&s;on, they would have been led on to rea&s;on progre&s;&s;ively to the end, and thereby have di&s;covered that matter and all the properties it has, will not account for the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, and that there mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be a &s;uperior cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It was the exce&s;s to which imaginary &s;y&s;tems of religion had been carried, and the intolerance, per&s;ecutions, burnings, and ma&s;&s;acres, they occa&s;ioned, that fir&s;t induced certain per&s;ons to propagate infi|delity; thinking, that upon the whole, it was better not to believe at all, than to believe a multitude of things and complicated creeds, that occa&s;ioned &s;o much mi&s;chief in the world. But tho&s;e days are pa&s;t; per&s;ecution has cea&s;ed, and the antidote then &s;et up again&s;t it has no
<PB N="31" REF="30">
longer even the &s;hadow of apology. We profe&s;s, and we proclaim in peace, the pure, unmixed, comfortable, and rational belief of a God, as manife&s;ted to us in the univer&s;e. We do this without any appre|hen&s;ion of that belief being made a cau&s;e of per&s;ecution as other beliefs have been, or of &s;uffering per&s;ecution our&s;elves. To God, and not to man, are all men to account for their belief.</P>
<P>It has been well ob&s;erved at the fir&s;t in&s;titution of this &s;ociety, that the dogmas it profe&s;&s;es to believe, are from the commencement of the world; that they are not novelties, but are confe&s;&s;edly the ba&s;is of all &s;y&s;tems of religion, however numerous and contradictory they may be. All men in the out&s;et of the religion they profe&s;s are Theophilanthro|pi&s;ts. It is impo&s;&s;ible to form any &s;y&s;tem of religion without build|ing upon tho&s;e principles, and therefore they are not &s;ectarian prin|ciples, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e a &s;ect compo&s;ed of all the world.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid in the cour&s;e of this di&s;cour&s;e, that the &s;tudy of natural philo&s;ophy is a divine &s;tudy, becau&s;e it is the &s;tudy of the works of God in the Creation. If we con&s;ider theology upon this ground, what an exten&s;ive field of improvement in things both divine and human opens it&s;elf before us. All the principles of &s;cience are of divine origin. It was not man that invented the principles on which a&s;tronomy, and every branch of mathematics are founded and &s;tudied. It was not man that gave properties to the circle and the triangle. Tho&s;e principles are eternal and immutable. We &s;ee in them the unchangeable nature of the Divinity. We &s;ee in them immortality, an immortality exi&s;ting after the material figures that expre&s;s tho&s;e properties are di&s;&s;olved in du&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ociety is at pre&s;ent in its infancy, and its means are &s;mall; but I wi&s;h to hold in view the &s;ubject I allude to, and in&s;tead of teach|ing the philo&s;ophical branches of learning as ornamental accompli&s;h|ments only, as they have hitherto been taught, to teach them in a manner that &s;hall combine theological knowledge with &s;cientific in|&s;truction; to do this to the be&s;t advantage, &s;ome in&s;truments will be nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e of explanation, of which the &s;ociety is not yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. But as the views of the &s;ociety extend to public good, as well as to that of the individual, and as its principles can have no enemies, means may be devi&s;ed to procure them.</P>
<P>If we unite to the pre&s;ent in&s;truction, a &s;eries of lectures on the ground I have mentioned, we &s;hall, in the fir&s;t place, render theology the mo&s;t delightful and entertaining of all &s;tudies. In the next place, we &s;hall give &s;cientific in&s;truction to tho&s;e who could not otherwi&s;e obtain it. The mechanic of every profe&s;&s;ion will there be taught the mathematical principles nece&s;&s;ary to render him a proficient in his art. The cultivator will there &s;ee developed the principles of vege|tation; while, at the &s;ame time, they will be led to &s;ee the hand of God in all the&s;e things.</P>
