<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following Sheets are a few of that va&s;t Number of <HI>Ceremonies</HI> and <HI>Opi|nions,</HI> which are held by the Common People; &s;uch as they &s;olely or generally ob&s;erve. For tho' &s;ome of them have been of National and others perhaps of univer&s;al Ob&s;er|vance, yet at pre&s;ent they would have little or no Being, if not ob&s;erved among the Vulgar.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9">I would not be thought a Reviver of old Rites and Ceremonies to the Burden|ing of the People, nor an Aboli&s;her of in|nocent Cu&s;toms, which are their Plea&s;ures and Recreations: I aim at nothing, but a Regulation of tho&s;e which are in Being among&s;t them, which they them&s;elves are far from thinking burden&s;ome, and aboli|&s;hing &s;uch only as are &s;inful and wicked.</P>
<P>Some of the Cu&s;toms they hold, have been originally good, tho' at pre&s;ent they retain little of their primitive Purity; the true Meaning and De&s;ign of them, be|ing either lo&s;t, or very much in the Dark through Folly and Super&s;tition. To wipe off therefore the Du&s;t they have contract|ed, to clear them of Super&s;tition, and make known their End and De&s;ign, may turn to &s;ome Account, and be of Advan|tage; whereas ob&s;erving them in the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
Way, is not only of no Advantage, but of very great Detriment.</P>
<P>Others they hold, are really &s;inful, not|with&s;tanding in outward Appearance they &s;eem very harmle&s;s, being a Scandal to Religion, and an encouraging of Wicked|ne&s;s. And therefore to aim at aboli&s;h|ing the&s;e, will I hope be no Crime, tho' they be the Diver&s;ions of the People.</P>
<P>As to the Opinions they hold, they are almo&s;t all &s;uper&s;titious, being gene|rally either the Produce of Heatheni&s;m; or the Inventions of indolent <HI>Monks,</HI> who having nothing el&s;e to do, were the Forgers of many &s;illy and wicked Opi|nions, to keep the World in Awe and Ig|norance. And indeed the ignorant Part of the World, is &s;till &s;o aw'd, that they follow the idle Traditions of the one,
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
more than the Word of GOD; and have more Dependance upon the lucky Omens of the other than his Providence, more Dread of their unlucky ones, than his Wrath and Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The regulating therefore of the&s;e Opi|nions and Cu&s;toms, is what I propos'd by the following Compo&s;itions, whatever has been &s;ugge&s;ted to the contrary: And as to the Menaces of &s;ome, and the Cen&s;ures of others, I neither fear nor regard them. I &s;hall be always ready to own any Mi|&s;take, and in what I ju&s;tly may, to vin|dicate my &s;elf.</P>

<P>_THE Ceremony of Tolling the Bell at the Time of Death, &s;eems to be as ancient as the having of Bells them&s;elves; we are told, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bingham</HI>'s Orig. Eccl. Lib. 3.</NOTE> it was about the &s;eventh Century when Bells were fir&s;t in the Church, and that venerable <HI>Bede</HI> is the fir&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="21">
that mentions them. If this be true, then it is as true, that the Tolling of the Bell was in&s;ti|tuted about that Time; for where our Coun|try-man mentions the Word <HI>Campana,</HI> or Bell, there it al&s;o is, that we find a Bell made u&s;e of for the Dead: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haec, tunc in dormitorio &s;ororum pau&s;ans, exaudivit &s;ubito in aere notum campanae &s;onum, quo ad orationes ex|citari vel convocati &s;olebant, cum quis eorum de &s;eculo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ui&s;&s;et evocatus. <HI>Bed. Eccl. Hi&s;t. Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>Cap.</HI> 23.</NOTE> For at the Death of the Abbe&s;s St. <HI>Hilda,</HI> he tells us that one of the Si|&s;ters of a di&s;tant Mona&s;tery, as &s;he was &s;leeping, thought &s;he heard the well known Sound of that Bell, which called them to Prayers, when any of them had departed this Life. But be that as it will, it is evident, that the Bell was tolled up|on this Occa&s;ion about <HI>Bede</HI>'s Time, and con&s;e|quently that the Ceremony is as ancient, as his Days.</P>
<P>THE Rea&s;on why this Cu&s;tom was in&s;tituted, was not, as &s;ome &s;eem to imagine, for no other End than to acquaint the Neighbourhood, that &s;uch a Per&s;on was dead; but chiefly, that who|ever heard the Noi&s;e of the Bell, &s;hould put up their Prayers for the Soul: Thus the Fa|ther
<PB N="3" REF="22">
above-mentioned tells us again, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Quod cum illa audi&s;&s;et, &s;u&s;citavit cunctas &s;orores &amp; in eccle&s;iam convocatas, orationibus &amp; p&s;almis pro anima ma|tris operam dare monuit. <HI>ibid.</HI></NOTE> That &s;he who pre&s;ided in this Mona&s;tery, had no &s;ooner heard this, than &s;he rai&s;ed all the Si&s;ters, and called them into the Church, where &s;he exhorted them to pray fervently, and &s;ing a <HI>Re|quiem</HI> for the Soul of their Mother. <HI>Ca&s;&s;alion</HI> al&s;o upon this Place of <HI>Bede,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>That</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et talis ritus etiam de prae&s;enti &s;ervatur in <HI>Anglia,</HI> ut cum quis dece&s;&s;it, &s;tatim campana propriae illius Pa|rochiae &s;peciali quodam modo &s;onat per aliquod temporis &s;patium.&mdash;Quamvis <HI>Angli</HI> negent modo orationes &amp; &s;uf|fragia defunctis proficua; non aliam tamen in hoc ab illis rationem potui percipere, quam quod talis &s;onus &s;it ritus antiquae eccle&s;iae <HI>Anglicanae, Ca&s;&s;ali</HI> de vet Sac. Chri&s;t. Rit. P. 241.</NOTE> <HI>the &s;ame Cu&s;tom is &s;till ob&s;erved in</HI> England, <HI>that as &s;oon as any hath departed this Life, the Bell be|longing to the Pari&s;h he liv'd in, was immedi|ately tolled, and for &s;ome Time.&mdash;And tho'</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>now deny, that Prayers are of any Service to the Dead; yet I could meet with no other Account of this Ceremony, than that it was a Cu&s;tom of the old Church of</HI> England.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="23">AND for this Rea&s;on it is, that this Cu&s;tom was fir&s;t ob&s;erved, and &s;hould be &s;till retain'd among us, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Prayers of the Faith|ful may be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to the Soul; and certainly it might be more profitably retain'd, were it &s;o order'd, that the Bell &s;hould be tolled before the Per&s;on's Departure, as was undoubtedly de|&s;igned when this Ceremony was continued, that good Men might give him their Prayers. Was this always &s;o ob&s;erved, there might be &s;ome <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> among&s;t the Number of the Faithful, who&s;e Prayers could prevail upon GOD, to beat back <HI>the Amalekites of Darkne&s;s;</HI> &s;ome who&s;e <HI>Faith</HI> might remove a <HI>Mountain of Sins,</HI> and &s;ome who&s;e Tears procure a Multitude of Mer|cies. O the Comfort of <HI>the Forgivenne&s;s of Sins!</HI> Of <HI>being guided &s;afely through the Sha|dow of Death!</HI> Of arriving &s;ecurely at the Hea|venly Country! What is it that Prayer can't obtain?</P>
<P>BUT tho' the Wickedne&s;s and Impenitency of the dying Per&s;on be &s;uch, as that the Pray|ers of the Faithful will not be &s;ufficient to avert the Wrath and Puni&s;hment of a ju&s;tly incen&s;ed
<PB N="5" REF="24">
GOD; yet as this can be only known to GOD, it will not di&s;charge Men from recommending him to the Divine Mercy, in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate and affectionate Manner. They thereby ex|pre&s;s the mo&s;t laudable Zeal, the mo&s;t di&s;inte|re&s;ted Charity; and whil&s;t they are &s;o &s;ollici|tous for the Happine&s;s and Welfare of other Mens Souls, they cannot but be thereby influ|enced to have the greate&s;t Concern for their own, and be both encouraged and directed to proceed with an holy Emulation <HI>from Strength to Strength,</HI> and endeavour as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 1.</NOTE> Apo&s;tle ad|vi&s;es, <HI>to go on to Perfection.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, alas! we are fallen into Times of &s;uch Irreligion and Prejudice, &s;uch Contempt of An|tiquity, and &s;uch too great Reformation, that what with Indolence on one Hand, and Igno|rance on the other; what with no Zeal on this Side, and too <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Among the many Objections of the <HI>Browni&s;ts,</HI> it is laid to the Charge of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> That tho' we deny the Doctrine of Purgatory, and teach the contrary; yet how well our Practice &s;uits with it, may be con&s;idered in our Ring|ing of hallowed Bells for the Soul. Bi&s;h. <HI>Hall.</HI> cont. <HI>Brown.</HI></NOTE> fal&s;e a one on that; we either neglect the mo&s;t decent Ceremonies of Religion,
<PB N="6" REF="25">
or we think it is Religion to have no Ceremo|nies at all.

<P>HOW unlike to this ancient Cu&s;tom of Watch|ing is the modern one, of locking up the Corps in a Room, and leaving it there alone?

<P>_IT hath been ob&s;erved among all Nations, both in the Heathen and the Chri&s;tian World, as a becoming and profitable Cere|mony, to follow the Corps to the Grave.

For this Rea&s;on the Chri&s;tian al&s;o ob&s;erves the Cu&s;tom, and may, if he plea|&s;es, as he follows the Body to the Grave, en|tertain him&s;elf with a pious Meditation upon it, in &s;uch like Thoughts as the&s;e of the P&s;almi&s;t. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xc.&mdash;</NOTE> <HI>Thou art GOD from Everla&s;ting, and World without End; Thou turne&s;t Man to De&s;truction; again, Thou &s;aye&s;t, Come again ye Children of Men.

As &s;oon as thou &s;cattere&s;t them, they are even as a Sleep, and fade away &s;uddenly like the Gra&s;s.

were a Span long, and mine Age is nothing in re|&s;pect of Thee; and verily every Man living is al|together Vanity. And now, LORD, what is my Hope? Truly my Hope is even in Thee. Deliver me from all mine Offences, and O &s;pare me a little that I may recover my Strength, before I go hence and be no more &s;een.</HI> Such Thoughts as the&s;e of our Friend's, and of our own Mortality, would excite us to prepare for our own Change.</P>
<P>AND as this Form of Proce&s;&s;ion is an Em|blem of our dying &s;hortly after our Friend, &s;o the carrying of Ivy, or Laurel, or Ro&s;emary, or &s;ome of tho&s;e Ever-Greens, is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality. It is as much as to &s;ay, That tho' the Body be dead, yet the Soul is Ever-Green and always in Life: It is not like the Body, and tho&s;e other Greens which die and revive again at their proper Sea&s;ons, no <HI>Autumn</HI> nor <HI>Winter</HI> can make a Change in it, but it is unalterably the &s;ame, perpetually in Life, and never dying.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Romans,</HI> and other Heathens upon this Occa&s;ion, made U&s;e of Cypre&s;s, which being
<PB N="20" REF="39">
once cut, will never flouri&s;h nor grow any more, as an Emblem of their dying for ever, and be|ing no more in Life.

<P>AND as the carrying of the&s;e Ever-Greens is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality, &s;o it is al&s;o of the Re&s;urrection of the Body: For as the&s;e Herbs are not entirely pluck'd up, but only cut down, and will, at the returning Sea&s;on, revive and &s;pring up again; &s;o the Bo|dy, like them, is but cut down for a while, and will ri&s;e and &s;hoot up again at the Re&s;urrection. For, as the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;ays, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. lxiii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Our Bones &s;hall flouri&s;h like an Herb.</HI></P>

Joy, and are become Conquerors; which &s;ure|ly is a Matter of no little Con&s;olation for the loo&s;ing of our Friend. And how becoming is it to pay &s;uch Honour to the Body!

For as they rejoyce <HI>at her Conver&s;ion on Earth,</HI> &s;o mo&s;t certainly they rejoyce at her go|ing to Heaven. And as they rejoyce at the car|rying of the Soul thither, &s;o we, in Imitation of them, at the carrying out the Body to the Grave. They rejoyce that the Soul hath got out of a World of Sin, we that the Body out of a World of Trouble; they that the Soul can &s;in no more, we that the Body can no more &s;uf|fer; they that the Soul enjoys Glory and Hap|pine&s;s, we that the Body re&s;ts from its Labours.</P>
<P>WHEN therefore we attend the Corps of a Neighbour or Relation, and this decent Cere|mony is perform'd, let it al&s;o have a Share of our Thoughts, and excite in us Joy and Com|fort, and Thank&s;giving and Prai&s;e.

They prayed that Way, believing that our SAVIOUR would come to Judgment from that Quarter of the Heavens. <HI>For as the Lightning cometh out of the Ea&s;t, and &s;hineth unto the We&s;t, &s;o &s;hall the Coming of the Son of Man be; and he is to come in like Manner as he a&s;cended.</HI> And that he a&s;cended up Ea&s;tward from Mount <HI>Oli|vet,</HI> St. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dama&s;c.

<P>WHAT may more confirm this, and &s;peak it to have been the univer&s;al Opinion of the Church, is the ancient Cu&s;tom of burying the Corps, with the Feet to the Ea&s;t, and the Head to the We&s;t; which Cu&s;tom is continued to this Day in the whole Church of <HI>England:</HI> This was ob&s;erved for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, That, at the Coming of CHRIST to Judgment from

<P>OUR learned Countryman <HI>Gregory</HI> tells us, <Q>That the holy Men of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> hold a Tra|dition generally received from their Ancients, that our SAVIOUR him&s;elf was buried, with his Face and Feet towards the Ea&s;t.

<P>NO Doubt but this learned Man had great Rea&s;on for this Conclu&s;ion, as well knowing that this ancient Rite, was &s;truck at by the whole Herd of Sectaries, as a &s;illy Fancy and an idle Dream: Who never would ob&s;erve it,

<P>_IT is a received Tradition among the Vulgar, That at the Time of Cock-crowing, the Midnight Spirits for&s;ake the&s;e lower Re|gions, and go to their proper Places. They wander, &s;ay they, about the World, from the dead Hour of Night, when all Things are buried in Sleep and Darkne&s;s, till the Time of Cock-crowing, and then they
<PB N="38" REF="57">
depart. Hence it is, that in Country-Places, where the Way of Life requires more early La|bour, they always go chearfully to Work at that Time; whereas if they are called abroad &s;ooner, they are apt to imagine every Thing they &s;ee or hear, to be a wandring Gho&s;t. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> hath given us an excellent Account of this vulgar Notion, in his Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet.</HI></P>

<L>The Nights are whol&s;ome, then no Planet &s;trikes,</L>

<L>So gracious and &s;o hallowed is that Time.</L>
</SP>
<P><PB N="39" REF="58">NOW to &s;hew what Truth there is in this vulgar Opinion, I &s;hall con&s;ider, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> What Truth there is in the Roaming of Spirits in the Night. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether they are obli|ged to go away at Cock-crow.</P>
<P>I believe none who a&s;&s;ent to the Truth of Divine Revelation, deny that there are good and evil Angels attending upon Men; the one to guard and protect them, and the other to harm and work their Ruin; that the one are <HI>tho&s;e</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. i. 14.&mdash;</NOTE> <HI>mini&s;tring Spirits, which are &s;ent out to mini&s;ter to the Heirs of Salvation;</HI> the other the <HI>roaring Lion,</HI> and his In&s;truments, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job ii. 2.&mdash;</NOTE> <HI>who wander to and fro in the Earth; the&s;e</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xii. 43.</NOTE> <HI>unclean Spirits who wander through dry Places, &s;eeking Re&s;t and finding none.</HI></P>
<P>NOR, I believe, will it be que&s;tion'd, that there have been Apparitions of good and evil Spirits, and that many, with our SAVIOUR'S Di&s;ciples, have been <HI>affrighted and cried out,</HI> not only with &s;uppo&s;ing they had &s;een, but really with &s;eeing a Spirit. Of this the Te&s;ti|mony
<PB N="40" REF="59">
of all Ages, and Scripture it &s;elf are a &s;ufficient Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>WHAT then could the&s;e have ordinarily been, but the Appearances of &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Angels of Light,</HI> or Darkne&s;s? For I am far from thinking that either the Gho&s;ts of the Damn'd or the Happy, either the Soul of a <HI>Di|ves</HI> or a <HI>Lazarus,</HI> returns here any more. For as St. <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> ob&s;erves, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hai <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n tois n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ois, &amp;c Athan. <HI>Tom. 2. P. 34.</HI></NOTE> <HI>The&s;e Vi&s;ions and Shades of the Saints, which appear in the Tem|ples and at the Tombs, are not the Souls of the Saints them&s;elves, but the good Angels appearing in their Shapes.</HI> Not that GOD could not re|mand the Gho&s;t of <HI>Samuel,</HI> and order it again to vi&s;it the Earth, as he made <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> to appear at our SAVIOUR'S Transfiguration; but that a Thing of this Nature was very un|common, and &s;eldom happen'd.</P>
<P>TAKING it therefore for granted, that there have been Apparitions of Angels, I believe it will al&s;o be owned, that the&s;e Apparitions have frequently happen'd in the Night. And truly,
<PB N="41" REF="60">
was there no direct Proof of this, yet the No|tion of their appearing in the Night, being as it were link'd and chained to our Idea of an Ap|parition, would almo&s;t per&s;wade us, that the Night is the mo&s;t proper Time for &s;uch Appea|rances. Whether it is, that the Fables of Nur|&s;es, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lock,</HI> Human Under&s;t.</NOTE> as an ingenious Author imagines, <Q>have &s;o a&s;&s;ociated the Idea of Spirit to the Night, that the one never appears without the other;</Q> or whether there is &s;omething in the Pre&s;ence of Night, &s;ome Awfulne&s;s and Horrour, which naturally di&s;po&s;e the Mind of Man to the&s;e Reflections. I am indeed very inclinable to be|lieve, that the&s;e Legendary Stories of Nur&s;es and old Women, are the Occa&s;ion of much greater Fears, than People without them, would generally have of the&s;e Things; but I cannot help thinking, that the Pre&s;ence of Night, would naturally lead a Man to &s;ome Reflection of Spirits, without any &s;uch Cau&s;e as that learned Author mentions. There are &s;ome particular Times, which will naturally rai&s;e &s;ome parti|cular Thoughts: Thus on a bright &s;unny Day
<PB N="42" REF="61">
we are naturally di&s;po&s;ed to Mirth and Gaiety; when the Day over-ca&s;ts, or the Weather is hazy, we then turn indolent and dull, and &s;ooth our &s;elves in Melancholly; if it Thunder and Lighten, we think of the Day of Judg|ment and &s;udden Death: And thus al&s;o the Night, as it inclines us to grave and &s;erious Thoughts, rai&s;es in us Horrour and Di&s;may, and makes us afraid, even when our Judgment tells us there is no Fear; &s;o it may of it &s;elf be look'd upon as a natural Cau&s;e of &s;uch Reflections.</P>
<P>BUT however this be, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily own, that Spirits have frequently appeared in the Night, or we mu&s;t give the Lye to the Traditions of all Ages, to Hi&s;torians prophane and &s;acred, and the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t in the Ge|nerations of Men.</P>
<P>IN the Heathen World there are many In|&s;tances, of which I &s;hall only mention this one out of <HI>Plutarch:</HI> <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Vit. Mar. <HI>Brut.</HI> Tran&s;.

him, all the Re&s;t of the Army being hu&s;ht and &s;ilent; and mu&s;ing with him&s;elf, and very thoughtful, as he turn'd his Eye to the Door, he &s;aw a &s;trange and terrible Appearance, of a prodigious and frightful Body coming towards him without &s;peaking. <HI>Brutus</HI> boldly asked him, What art thou? Man, or God? Or upon what Bu&s;ine&s;s do'&s;t thou come to us? The Spi|rit an&s;wer'd, I am thy <HI>Evil Genius,</HI> thou &s;halt &s;ee me at <HI>Philippi;</HI> to which <HI>Brutus</HI> not at all di&s;turbed, reply'd, Then I will &s;ee thee there.</Q></P>
<P>IN the &s;acred Writings we have <HI>Job</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job&mdash;</NOTE> <HI>terri|fied with Vi&s;ions of the Night,</HI> when deep Sleep falleth upon Men, Fear came upon him and Trembling, which made all his Bones to &s;hake; then a Spirit pa&s;&s;ed by before his Face, and the Hair of his Fle&s;h &s;tood up.

<P>BUT tho' it be true from Scripture, that there have been nightly Apparitions, yet the&s;e
<PB N="44" REF="63">
are chiefly of good Angels; whereas this Opi|nion principally means, the Appearances of evil Spirits. It mu&s;t be owned indeed, that the Appearances of evil Spirits, if litterally, are yet but very &s;eldom mention'd in the Night in Scripture; but however, that they wander and appear at Night, is very deducible from, if not litterally mentioned in it. Their's <HI>is the Land of Darkne&s;s, and the Shadow of Death: They are re&s;erved under Chains of Dark|ne&s;s to the Judgment of the great Day; and we know that every one that doth Evil natu|rally hateth the Light: They therefore love Darkne&s;s rather than Light, becau&s;e their Deeds are Evil.</HI> The Night therefore, in a more e|&s;pecial Manner, &s;eems to be their <HI>Hour,</HI> and the <HI>Power of Darkne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was the Opinion of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as may be learned from the Fear of the Apo&s;tles, when they &s;aw our Saviour about the fourth Watch of the Night, coming to them upon the Waters: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xiv. 25.</NOTE> <HI>They were affrighted and cryed out, &s;uppo&s;ing

<P>AND that this was al&s;o the Opinion of the ancient Chri&s;tians, is evident, not only from their dividing the Night into four Watches, the Evening, Midnight, Cock-crowing, and the Morning; which were the Military Divi&s;ions of the Night, and which <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Si quidem &amp; in Nocte Stationes, &amp; Vigiliae Militares in quatuor partes divi&s;ae ternis horarum &s;patiis &s;ecernun|tur. <HI>I&s;idore,</HI> Lib. 1. de Eccle.

who had been Abroad in the Night, &s;ays, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aurora itaque &s;uperveniente, cum omnis haec ab ocu|lis evani&s;&s;et Daemonum multitudo. <HI>Ca&s;&s;.</HI> Coll. 8. C. 16.</NOTE> That as &s;oon as the Morn approached, they all vani&s;hed and fled away. By this we &s;ee, that this was a current Opinion at this Time of Day; but what Rea&s;on they had for it, except &s;ome Relations of the di&s;appearing of Evil Spirits at that Hour, I never yet have met with: But there have been produc'd at that Time of Night, Things of very memora|ble Worth, which might perhaps rai&s;e the pious Credulity of &s;ome Men to imagine, that there was &s;omething more in it, than in other Times. It was about the Time of Cock-crow|ing when our Saviour was born, and the An|gels &s;ung the fir&s;t Chri&s;tmas-Carol to the poor Shepherds, in the Fields of <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> Now it may be pre&s;um'd, that as the Saviour of the World was then born, and the <HI>Heavenly Host</HI> had then de&s;cended to proclaim&punc; the News, that the Angels of Darkne&s;s would be terrified and confounded, and immediately fly away: And perhaps this Con&s;ideration has partly been the Foundation of this Opinion; for as this
<PB N="50" REF="69">
may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;o perhaps it has been imagin'd, that the Spirits of Darkne&s;s, having always in Memory that fatal Hour, are &s;tart|led and frighted away as the Cock proclaims it.</P>
<P>IT was al&s;o about this Time when he ro&s;e from the Dead. And when the great <HI>Sun of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI> was ri&s;en upon the World, no wonder that all the Clouds of Darkne&s;s and Wickedne&s;s were di&s;pell'd; no wonder that the conquer'd Powers of Hell were not able to &s;hew their Heads: And this perhaps hath been another Rea&s;on of their imagining that Spirits go away at that time.</P>
<P>A third Rea&s;on is, that Pa&s;&s;age in the Book of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> where Jacob <HI>wre&s;tled with the Angel for a Ble&s;&s;ing;</HI> where the Angel &s;ays unto him, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxii.</NOTE> <HI>Let me go, for the Day breaketh.</HI></P>
<P>BUT indeed this Tradition &s;eems more, e|&s;pecially to have ri&s;en from &s;ome particular Circum&s;tances attending the Time of Cock-crowing; and which, as <HI>Prudentius</HI> &s;eems to &s;ay above, are an Emblem of the Approach of
<PB N="51" REF="70">
the Day of the Re&s;urrection. For when we leave the World, we lie down in our Graves, and <HI>Re&s;t from our Labours;</HI> Sleep and Dark|ne&s;s lay hold upon us, and there we abide till the la&s;t Day appear, when the Voice of the Arch-Angel &s;hall awake us, that we may meet the LORD of Light and Day. And when we leave the common Bu&s;ine&s;s and Care of Life, we lie down in our Beds, as in a Grave, buried as it were in Sleep and Darkne&s;s, till the Cock crow, the welcome Me&s;&s;enger of the News of Day.</P>
<P>THE Circum&s;tances therefore of the Time of Cock-crowing, being &s;o natural a Figure and Repre&s;entation of the Morning of the Re&s;urre|ction; the Night &s;o &s;hadowing out the Night of the Grave; the third Watch, being as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, the Time our Saviour will come to Judgment at; the Noi&s;e of the <HI>Cock</HI> awaken|ing &s;leepy Man, and telling him as it were, <HI>the Night is far &s;pent, the Day is at Hand;</HI> re|pre&s;enting &s;o naturally the Voice of the Arch-Angel awakening the Dead, and calling up the Righteous to everla&s;ting Day; &s;o natural|ly does the Time of Cock-crowing &s;hadow out

the&s;e Things, that probably &s;ome good well-meaning Men, have been brought to believe, that the very Devils them&s;elves, when the Cock Crew, and reminded them of them, did fear and tremble, and &s;hun the Light.</P>
<P>NOW in An&s;wer to the fir&s;t of the&s;e Con|jectures: 'Tis very likely the Evil Spirits did fly away in the Morning of the Nativity, and becau&s;e of our Saviour's Birth and that <HI>Com|pany of the Heavenly Host,</HI> might be afraid and retire into thick Darkne&s;s; yet it will not hence follow, that it always happens &s;o at the Time of Cock-crowing: For if they did fly away that Morning, the Circum&s;tances of our Saviour's Birth, the heavenly Glory of the Angelick Quire, their Mu&s;ick and their Pre&s;ence were the Occa&s;ion of it: And why only the bare Remembrance of what happened at that Time, &s;hould always at the Time of Cock-crowing drive them away, rather than when they remem|ber it at another, no Rea&s;on &s;eems to be given.</P>
<P>AS to the &s;econd Conjecture, namely, That it was the Time of our Saviour's Ri&s;ing from
<PB N="53" REF="72">
the Dead, I an&s;wer in the &s;ame Manner, That tho' it be allowed, that the Evil Spirits might have returned to the Land of Darkne&s;s, upon our Saviour's Ri&s;ing from the Dead; yet why it &s;hould Occa&s;ion them always to do &s;o at that Time, no Rea&s;on can be given.</P>
<P>AS to the third Conjecture, it is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, That this was a good Angel, where|as they that &s;hun the Light, are bad ones: This was the Angel of the Covenant, the Cre|ator of Light, and the Lord of the Day: We may therefore as well imagine, that it was not in his Power, to get out of the Arms of <HI>Jacob,</HI> without &s;aying, <HI>Let me go;</HI> as to &s;uppo&s;e he was obliged to go, becau&s;e he &s;aid <HI>the Day breaketh.</HI> The meaning of which Words, <Q>According to <HI>Willet,</HI> is not that the Angel was gone to the ble&s;&s;ed Company of the Angels, to &s;ing their Morning Hymn to GOD, as the <HI>Hebrews</HI> imagine: For the Angels, not only in the Morning, but at other Times, are exerci&s;ed in prai&s;ing GOD. But the Angel thus &s;peaketh according to the Cu&s;tom of Men, having now taken the
<PB N="54" REF="73">
Form and Shape of a Man, as tho' he had ha&s;t to other Bu&s;ine&s;s, and leaving <HI>Jacob</HI> al|&s;o to his Affairs.</Q></P>
<P>THE la&s;t Conjecture of the Ri&s;e of this Tra|dition, &s;eems to carry greater probability than the Others: For as the&s;e Things are a Repre|&s;entation of the Circum&s;tances of the Morning of the Re&s;urrection, &s;o they mu&s;t &s;ure enough bring that la&s;t Day into Remembrance; and they never can do &s;o, but as &s;urely they mu&s;t create Terrour and Confu&s;ion in all the Devils and Gho&s;ts of the Night: Whil&s;t they a&s;&s;ure them they &s;hall never any more enjoy the Realms of Bli&s;s, but be hurried into that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxv. 41.</NOTE> <HI>e|verla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI> But that the&s;e Things are the Occa|&s;ion of their Flying away at the Approach of Day, is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed. On the contrary, the Devil and his Angels ramble o'er the World in Day-light, and are mid-day Devils, as well as mid-night ones: For the Devil is ince&s;&s;ant in his Temptations, and therefore he is abroad in the Day as well as the Night, tho'
<PB N="55" REF="74">
perhaps has &s;eldom appear'd but in Darkne&s;s. Thus St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> in one of his Meditations, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et ideo Deus meus ad te clamamus, libera nos ab ad|ver&s;ario no&s;tro quotidiano, qui &s;ive dormiamus, &s;ive vigi|lemus,&mdash;die ac nocte fraudibus &amp; artibus, nunc palam nunc occulte &s;agittas venenatas contra nos dirigens, ut in|terficiat animas no&s;tras. <HI>Aug.

<P>AND now, what, tho' this be true, as it mo&s;t certainly &s;eems to be &s;o, that at the chearful Hour of Cock-crowing, the wander|ing Gho&s;ts are not driven away, but &s;till continue going too and fro? What, tho' then their Power be &s;till the &s;ame, and their In|tentions as fully bent to do Evil? Con&s;ider but that GOD'S Care and Providence govern the World, and there will be found as much Safety for us, in the mid&s;t of Evil Spirits, as if they ab&s;ented at that Time. The Al|mighty Power of GOD, is the &s;ame then, as
<PB N="56" REF="75">
at other Times; nothing but that, pre&s;erved us continually, and that, will always be able to pre&s;erve us.

<P>ARE we then afraid of Darkne&s;s and the pre&s;ence of Night? Let us remember the Cre|ator of them, and have but Faith in him, and we &s;hall find <HI>our Night turned into Day. In his Light &s;hall we &s;ee Light:</HI> We &s;hall be as &s;ecure as if there was no Darkne&s;s about us, as well knowing, that that GOD which pro|tects us, &s;ees through the thicke&s;t <HI>Mediums,</HI> and the darke&s;t Night: <HI>For with him the Dark|ne&s;s is no Darkne&s;s, but the Night is as clear as the Day; the Darkne&s;s and Light to him are

both alike.</HI> Or are we afraid of that old Ser|pent the Devil, that nightly Rambler of the World, who is a Lover of Night and Dark|ne&s;s? Let us tru&s;t in GOD, and no harm &s;hall happen to us. If we will but <HI>fear no Evil, his Rod and his Staff &s;hall Comfort us, tho' we walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death: For GOD hath re&s;erved the Devil and his Angels in everla&s;ting Chains, under Darkne&s;s, unto the Judgment of the great Day.</HI> Tho' therefore he is permitted to wan|der the World, yet he is &s;o chain'd up, that without GOD'S particular Order or Permi&s;|&s;ion, he is not allowed to touch the Sons of Men; and he is &s;o re&s;erved and kept in Dark|ne&s;s, that it is not in his Power even barely to appear and be vi&s;ible to them, without the Permi&s;&s;ion of GOD: So little Rea&s;on hath e|very good Man to fear the Spight and Malice of all the Devils in Hell.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of Church-Yards; why the Vulgar are generally afraid of pa&s;&s;ing through them at Night: The Original of this Fear: That there is nothing in them now, more than in other Places to be afraid of.</HEAD>
<P>_THE mo&s;t of ignorant People are afraid of going through a <HI>Church-Yard</HI> at Night-time. If they are obliged upon &s;ome ha&s;ty and urgent Affair, they fear and tremble, till they are beyond its Bounds, but they generally avoid it, and go further about. It would, no Que&s;tion, be better if there were fewer <HI>Path-ways</HI> through Church-Yards than there are, both as it would prevent &s;everal <HI>Abu&s;es</HI> committed in them, and al&s;o cau&s;e the A&s;hes of the Dead to be in
<PB N="60" REF="79">
greater quiet, and more undi&s;turbed Peace: We &s;hould not then &s;ee Church-Yards changed into common Dunghils, nor &s;hould we tread &s;o frequently upon the Bones of our Friends: But when for the Conveniency of Neighbour|hood, or other Rea&s;ons, there are allowed pub|lick Ways, it is a very great Weakne&s;s to be afraid of pa&s;&s;ing through them.</P>
<P>THE Rea&s;on of this Fear is, a Notion they have imbib'd, that in <HI>Church-Yards</HI> there is a frequent walking of Spirits at the <HI>Dead-time</HI> of Night. Indeed there is at that Time &s;ome|thing awful and horrible every where, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd &s;omething more &s;olemn in a <HI>Church-Yard,</HI> than in the Generality of other Places; but that it is then more frequented with <HI>Apparitions and Gho&s;ts</HI> than other Places are, is at this Time of Day intirely ground|le&s;s, and without any Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE Original of this Timorou&s;ne&s;s may be deduc'd from the Heathens: For they believ|ed that the <HI>departed Gho&s;ts</HI> came out of their <HI>Tombs</HI> and <HI>Sepulchres,</HI> and wander'd about the

<P>THE giving of Names to Wells, is of great Antiquity: We find it a Cu&s;tom in the Days of the old Patriarchs. <HI>Abraham</HI> ob&s;erved this Cu&s;tom; and therefore the Well, which he recover'd from the Servants of <HI>Abimeleck,</HI> He <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxi. 31.</NOTE> called <HI>Beer-&s;heba,</HI> or the Well of the Oath,

Hence it was that they con&s;ulted the Intrails of Bea&s;ts, the Flights of Birds, and &s;everal other Things: And that the very
<PB N="72" REF="91">
Things above-mentioned, as the Authori|ties there declare, have been ob&s;erved by them; yea, they have ob&s;erv'd them, even in the remote&s;t Ages, beyond the Days of the olde&s;t Records. The Heathen World there|fore was full of them, and without all doubt they have been handed down to us, from the&s;e Times.</P>
<P>AND as it is not to be que&s;tion'd, but we had them from the Heathens, &s;o in all proba|bility the Heathens have taken them from the People of GOD, and built many of their Folies and ominous Super&s;titions on a Cu&s;tom which they alone were indulged in. For in the ear|lie&s;t Ages of the World, when a Matter of a|ny great Con&s;equence was depending, and the Servants of GOD would know what the E|vent would be, they asked a <HI>Sign</HI> of GOD, by de&s;iring that &s;uch a Thing might happen, if they were to &s;ucceed, and GOD was &s;ome|times &s;o conde&s;cending as to grant them their de&s;ire. Thus we read, That <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sam. i. 14. iii. 20.</NOTE> <HI>Jonathan</HI> ac|company'd only by his Armour-Bearer, not fear|ing
<PB N="73" REF="92">
the Steepne&s;s of the Rocks, nor Multi|tudes of Enemies, attempted the Garri&s;on of the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> and conquered, through a To|ken of this Nature. <HI>If they &s;ay,</HI> &s;ays he to his Armour-Bearer, <HI>Tarry untill we come up, then we will &s;tand &s;till in our Place, and will not go up unto them; but if they &s;ay come up unto us, then we will go up; for the LORD hath delivered them into our Hands, and this &s;hall be a Sign unto us.</HI> And &s;o indeed it came to pa&s;s, GOD who had in&s;pired <HI>Jonathan</HI> with this Thought, directing the Tongues of the others according to his Wi&s;hes. In like Manner, when the good old Servant of <HI>Abraham</HI> had arrived at the City of <HI>Nahor,</HI> to find a Wife for his Ma&s;ter's Son; we have him de&s;iring of GOD, that the Sign of the Woman he &s;hould pitch upon, might be her &s;aying, <HI>Drink, and I will give thy Camels drink al&s;o.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxiv. 12.</NOTE> <HI>And he &s;aid, O Lord GOD of my Ma&s;ter</HI> Abraham, <HI>I pray thee &s;end me good &s;peed this Day, and &s;hew Kindne&s;s unto my Ma&s;ter</HI> Abraham: <HI>Behold, I &s;tand here by the Well of Water, and the Daughters of the Men of the City come out to draw Water.

let it come to pa&s;s, that the Dam&s;el to whom I &s;hall &s;ay, let down thy Pitcher, I pray thee, that I may Drink; And &s;he &s;hall &s;ay, Drink, and I will give thy Camels drink al&s;o: Let the &s;ame be &s;he that thou ha&s;t appointed for thy Servant</HI> I&s;aac; <HI>and thereby &s;hall I know that thou ha&s;t &s;hewed Kindne&s;s unto my Ma&s;ter.</HI> This happened ac|cording to his Prayer, by which he knew that the LORD had pro&s;pered his Journey. Now this Cu&s;tom we know the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> imitated, when they would know whether they had been afflicted by the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> for keep|ing the Ark. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sam. i. 6, 9.</NOTE> <HI>They took the Ark of the LORD, and laid it on a Cart, and &s;ent it away.

<P>IN the&s;e early Ages of the World, GOD permitted &s;uch Things upon extraordinary Oc|ca&s;ions, to be asked by his own People. But they were only peculiar to tho&s;e Times. We have no Warrant for doing the like: It be|comes not us to pre&s;cribe Means to GOD, by
<PB N="75" REF="94">
which we may judge of our future Succe&s;s, but to depend on his Power and Wi&s;dom, his Care and Providence.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the Country Conver&s;ation in a Winter's Evening: Their Opinions of Spirits and Apparitions; of the Devil's ap|pearing with a cloven Foot; of Fai|ries and Hobgoblins; of the walk|ing Places of Spirits; and of haun|ted Hou&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>_NOTHING is commoner in <HI>County Places,</HI> than for a whole Family in a <HI>Winter's Evening,</HI> to &s;it round the Fire, and tell Stories of Appariti|ons and Gho&s;ts. And no Que&s;tion of it, but this adds to the natural Fearfulne&s;s of Men, and makes them many Times imagine they &s;ee Things, which really are nothing but their
<PB N="77" REF="96">
own Fancy. From this, and &s;eldom any o|ther Cau&s;e, it is, that <HI>Herds</HI> and <HI>Shepherds</HI> have all of them &s;een <HI>frequent Apparitions,</HI> and are generally &s;o well &s;tock'd with Stories of their own Knowledge. Some of them have &s;een <HI>Fairies,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Spirits</HI> in the Shapes of <HI>Cows</HI> and <HI>Dogs</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;es;</HI> and &s;ome have &s;een even the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf, with a <HI>cloven Foot.</HI> All which, is either <HI>Hear&s;ay</HI> or a <HI>&s;trong Imagina|tion.</HI> Not that there have not been, or may not be Apparitions; we know that there have undoubtedly been &s;uch Things, and that there &s;till are, upon particular Occa&s;ions; but that almo&s;t all the Stories of Gho&s;ts and Spirits, are grounded on no other Bottom, than the Fears and Fancies, and weak Brains of Men.</P>
<P>IN their Account of the Apparition of the Devil, they always de&s;cribe him with a <HI>cloven Foot:</HI> That is always his di&s;tingui&s;hing Badge, whatever Shape he appears in; whether it be in Beauty or Deformity, he never appears with|out it. Such is the old Tradition they have received of his appearing, and &s;uch is their Belief of it.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="97">INDEED it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that this is not &s;o improbable and ridiculous as many Things they hold. For tho' perhaps few of them have ought el&s;e for this Opinion, but <HI>old Wives Fables,</HI> or the Picture of the Devil, which they have always ob&s;erved drawn with a cloven Foot, yet there &s;eems to be &s;ome Truth in it. For in the Times of frequent Apparitions, the Devil was wont to appear &s;o, if we may believe Antiquity; and there is al&s;o &s;ome Rea&s;on for it, con&s;idering the Cir|cum&s;tances of the fallen Angels.</P>
<P>THE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brown<HI>'s</HI> Vulg. Err.</NOTE> Author of the <HI>Vulgar Errors</HI> upon this &s;ame Subject, hath the&s;e Words. <Q>The Ground of this Opinion at fir&s;t, might be his frequent appearing in the Shape of a Goat, which an&s;wers this De&s;cription. This was the Opinion of the ancient Chri&s;tians, concerning the Apparitions of <HI>Panites, Fauns</HI> and <HI>Satyrs;</HI> and of this Form we read of one, that appeared to <HI>Anthony</HI> in the Wil|derne&s;s. The &s;ame is al&s;o confirmed from Expo&s;itions of Holy Scripture. For where|as
<PB N="79" REF="98">
it is &s;aid, <HI>Thou &s;halt not offer unto Devils:</HI> The original Word is <HI>Seghnirim;</HI> that is, <HI>rough and hairy Goats,</HI> becau&s;e in that Shape the Devil mo&s;t often appeared, as is expoun|ded by the <HI>Rabbins,</HI> as <HI>Tremellius</HI> hath al&s;o explain'd, and as the Word <HI>A&s;cimah,</HI> the God of <HI>Emath</HI> is by &s;ome conceived. He ob&s;erves al&s;o, That the <HI>Goat</HI> was the Em|blem of the <HI>Sin Offering,</HI> and is the Emblem of &s;inful Men at the Day of Judgment.</Q></P>
<P>AND of this Opinion was al&s;o the learned Mr. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mede, Di&s;. <HI>40.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Mede.</HI> He &s;ays, <Q>That when Spirits conver&s;e with Men, it is under &s;ome vi&s;ible Shape, and that there is a Law given them that that Shape they a&s;&s;um'd, &s;hould be of &s;omething which more or le&s;s re&s;embled their Condition. For as in Nature we &s;ee every Thing hath a &s;everal and &s;uitable <HI>Phy|&s;iognomy</HI> or <HI>Figure,</HI> as a Badge of their in|ward Nature, whereby it is known, as by a Habit of Di&s;tinction, &s;o it &s;eems to be in the Shapes and Apparitions of Spirits. And as in a well governed Common-Wealth, eve|ry
<PB N="80" REF="99">
Sort and Condition is known by a diffe|ring Habit, agreeable to his Quality; &s;o it &s;eems it &s;hould be in GOD'S great Common-Wealth, concerning the Shapes which Spi|rits take upon them. And he that gave the Law, that a Man &s;hould not wear the Ha|bit of a Woman, nor a Woman the Habit of a Man, becau&s;e that as he had made them diver&s;e, &s;o would he have them &s;o known by their Habits; &s;o it &s;eems he will not &s;uf|fer a good and a bad Spirit, a noble and ig|noble one, to appear unto Man after the &s;ame Fa&s;hion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>NOW from this it will follow, that good Angels can take upon them no other Shape, but the Shape of Man, becau&s;e their glori|ous Excellency is re&s;embled only in the mo&s;t excellent of all vi&s;ible Creatures. The Shape of an inferior Creature would be un|&s;uitable, no other Shape becoming tho&s;e who are called <HI>the Sons of GOD,</HI> but his only, who <HI>was created after GOD's own Image.</HI> And yet, not his neither as he now is, but according as he was before his Fall
<PB N="81" REF="100">
in his glorious Beauty of his Integrity. Age and Deformity are the Fruits of Sin; and the Angel in the Go&s;pel appears like a young Man, <HI>His</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxviii.</NOTE> <HI>Countenance like Lightning, and his Raiment white as Snow,</HI> as it were re&s;em|bling the Beauty of glorified Bodies, in Im|mutability, Sublimity and Purity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HENCE al&s;o it follows on the contrary, that the Devil could not appear in humane Shape whil&s;t Man was in his Integrity; be|cau&s;e he was a Spirit fallen from his fir&s;t glorious Perfection, and therefore mu&s;t ap|pear in &s;uch Shape, which might argue his Imperfection and Aba&s;ement, which was the Shape of a Bea&s;t: Otherwi&s;e no Rea&s;on can be given, why he &s;hould not rather have appeared to <HI>Eve</HI> in the Shape of a Woman, than of a Serpent; for &s;o he might have gain'd an Opinion with her, both of more Excellency and Knowledge. But &s;ince the Fall of Man, the Ca&s;e is alter'd; now we know he can take upon him the Shape of Man; and no Wonder, &s;ince one falling Star
<PB N="82" REF="101">
may re&s;emble another. And therefore he appears it &s;eems in the Shape of Man's Im|perfection, either for Age or Deformity, as like an old Man (for &s;o the Witches &s;ay:) And perhaps it is not altogether fal&s;e, which is vulgarly affirmed, that the Devil appear|ing in humane Shape, hath always a Defor|mity of &s;ome uncouth Member or other; as tho' he could not yet take upon him hu|mane Shape intirely, for that Man him&s;elf is not intirely and utterly fallen as he is.</Q></P>
<P>THUS far hath this great and learned Man given his Opinion of this Matter, and that with &s;uch Strength of Rea&s;on and Argument, as leaves at lea&s;t a Probability behind it, of the Truth of this Opinion.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Part of this Conver&s;ation gene|rally turns upon <HI>Fairies.</HI> The&s;e, they tell you, have frequently been heard and &s;een, nay that there are &s;ome &s;till living who were &s;tollen away by them, and confined &s;even Years. According to the De&s;cription they give of them, who pretend to have &s;een them, they
<PB N="83" REF="102">
are in the Shape of Men, exceeding little: They are always clad in Green, and frequent the Woods and Fields; when they make Cakes (which is a Work they have been often heard at) they are very noi&s;y; and when they have done, they are full of Mirth and Pa&s;time. But generally they dance in <HI>Moon-Light,</HI> when Mortals are a&s;leep, and not capable of &s;eeing them, as may be ob&s;erved on the following Morn; their dancing Places being very di&s;tin|gui&s;hable. For as they dance Hand in Hand, and &s;o make a <HI>Circle</HI> in their Dance, &s;o next Day there will be &s;een <HI>Rings</HI> and <HI>Circles</HI> on the Gra&s;s.</P>
<P>NOW in all this there is really nothing, but an old fabulous Story, which has been handed down even to our Days from the Times of <HI>Heatheni&s;m,</HI> of a certain Sort of Beings called <HI>Lamiae,</HI> which were e&s;teem'd &s;o mi&s;|chievous and cruel, as to take away young Children and &s;lay them. The&s;e, together with the <HI>Fauns,</HI> the <HI>Gods of the Woods,</HI> &s;eem to have form'd the Notion of Fairies.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="103">THIS Opinion, in the benighted Ages of Popery, when <HI>Hobgoblins</HI> and <HI>Sprights</HI> were in every <HI>City</HI> and <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Village,</HI> by every <HI>Wa|ter</HI> and in every <HI>Wood,</HI> was very common. But when that Cloud was di&s;pell'd, and the Day &s;prung up, tho&s;e Spirits which wander'd in the Night of Ignorance and Error, did real|ly vani&s;h at the Dawn of Truth and the Light of Knowledge.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Tradition they hold, and which is often talk'd of, is, that there are particular Places alotted to Spirits to walk in. Thence it was that formerly, &s;uch frequent Reports were abroad of this and that particular Place being haunted by a Spirit, and that the com|mon People &s;ay now and then, &s;uch a Place is dangerous to be pa&s;s'd through at Night, be|cau&s;e a Spirit walks there. Nay, they'll fur|ther tell you, that &s;ome Spirits have lamented the Hardne&s;s of their Condition, in being obli|ged to walk in cold and uncomfortable Places, and have therefore de&s;ir'd the Per&s;on who was &s;o hardy as to &s;peak to them, to gift them with a warmer Walk, by &s;ome well grown <HI>Hedge,</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="104">
or in &s;ome <HI>&s;hady Vale,</HI> where they might be &s;helter'd from the Rain and Wind.</P>
<P>THE Stories, that Apparitions, have been &s;een oftner than once in the &s;ame Place, have no Doubt been the Ri&s;e and Spring of the wal|king Places of Spirits; but why they are &s;aid &s;ometimes to cry out for Places that are more comfortable, is not &s;o certainly known. It is however highly probable, that when the Ig|norance and Super&s;tition of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, had filled the World with <HI>Apparitions</HI> and <HI>Gho&s;ts,</HI> that this al&s;o was invented among them. For they &s;eem to have the mo&s;t <HI>Right</HI> to an In|vention of this Nature, who&s;e Brains were &s;o fruitful of Folly, as to invent that <NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Fuller</HI>'s Ch. Hi&s;t. Cen. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Dun&s;tan</HI> took the Devil by the No&s;e, with a Pair of hot <HI>Tongs</HI> till he roar'd again. For if the De|vil may be burnt, he may al&s;o be &s;tarv'd; if he took &s;uch Pains to get his No&s;e out of the <HI>Pincers,</HI> without Doubt in a fro&s;ty Night, he would wi&s;h to be as warm as po&s;&s;ible. He that believes the one, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily believe the other. And therefore it very near amounts
<PB N="86" REF="105">
to a Demon&s;tration, who were the Authors of this Opinion, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Monks.</HI> We are &s;ure they invented the one, and need little que|&s;tion but they invented the other.</P>
<P>THERE is a Story in the Book of <HI>Tobit,</HI> (which they may believe that will) of the <HI>evil Spirits</HI> flying into the utmo&s;t Parts of <HI>Egypt.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tob. vi.</NOTE> <HI>For as</HI> Tobias <HI>went in unto his Wife, he re|membred the Words of</HI> Raphael, <HI>and took the A&s;hes of the Perfumes, and put the Heart and Liver of the Fi&s;h thereupon, and made a Smoke therewith. The which Smell, when the evil Spirit had &s;melled, he fled into the utmo&s;t Parts of</HI> Egypt, <HI>and the Angel bound him.</HI> Now from this it is evident, that the Spirit was o|bliged to for&s;ake his good old Quarters and warm Lodgings, for inho&s;pitable De&s;arts and open Air: And from this, perhaps, &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>doting Monks,</HI> have per&s;uaded them&s;elves into a Belief of the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>WHEN it is proved to us, that this Book of <HI>Tobit</HI> is the Word of GOD, we may enter|tain

more Veneration for this Vulgar Opini|on; but till then, we mu&s;t be iudulg'd in wondering, how a Spirit, that is an <HI>immateri|al Sub&s;tance,</HI> can be affected with our Heat or Cold, or any Power or Quality of <HI>material Beings.</HI></P>
<P>THE la&s;t Topick of this Conver&s;ation I &s;hall take Notice of, &s;hall be the Tales of <HI>haunted</HI> Hou&s;es. And indeed it is not to be wonder'd at, that this is never omitted.

If a Hou&s;e was &s;eated on &s;ome melancholly Place, or built in &s;ome old Romantick Man|ner; or if any particular Accident had hap|pen'd in it, &s;uch as Murder, &s;udden Death, or the like, to be &s;ure that Hou&s;e had a Mark &s;et on it, and was afterwards e&s;teemed the Habita|tion of a Gho&s;t. In talking upon this Point, they generally &s;how the Occa&s;ion of the Hou&s;e's being <HI>haunted,</HI> the merry Pranks of the Spi|rit, and how it was laid. Stories of this Kind are infinite, and there are few <HI>Villages,</HI> which have not either had &s;uch an Hou&s;e in it, or near it.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="107">AND indeed there are Men of good Learn|ing and Knowledge, who are as far as others from Super&s;tition, who are inclinable to be|lieve, that &s;uch Things have been upon par|ticular Emergencies; tho', among the Stories that are told, they believe not one in a thou|&s;and. They know that Spirits have frequent|ly appeared to Men out of Hou&s;es, and they can &s;ee no Rea&s;on why they may not have ap|peared in them: They know nothing in an Hou&s;e more than in another Place, to prevent an Apparition, but an equal Help to its Vi&s;i|bility. The Air, which a Gho&s;t is &s;uppo&s;ed to be wrapped in, when it becomes vi&s;ible to Men, is there to be found, and they know of nothing el&s;e that may be an Argument again&s;t it.

<P>_IT is u&s;ual, in Country Places and Villages, where the Po|litene&s;s of the Age hath made no great Conque&s;t, to ob&s;erve &s;ome particular Times with &s;ome Ceremonies, which were cu&s;tomary in the Days of our Fore-fathers: Such are the great Fe&s;tivals of Chri&s;tmas, Ea&s;ter, and &s;everal o|thers,

which they ob&s;erve with Rites and Cu|&s;toms appropriated to them.</P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e we find a great Deference paid to <HI>Saturday Afternoon,</HI> above the other worky Days of the Week: Then the Labours of the Plough cea&s;t, and Refre&s;hment and Ea&s;e are over all the Village.</P>

<P>AMONG the primitive Chri&s;tians the LORD'S Day was always u&s;her'd in, with a <HI>Pernoctation</HI> or <HI>Vigil.</HI> They a&s;&s;embled in the Hou&s;e of GOD, and &s;ung P&s;alms and Prai&s;es to him a great Part of the Night, that they might be better prepa|red to &s;erve him on his own Day following.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark xiv.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVII.</HI> Of the Twelfth Day; how ob&s;erved: The Wickedne&s;s of ob&s;erving the Twelve Days after the common Way.</HEAD>
<P>_ON the <HI>Epiphany,</HI> or <HI>Manife&s;tati|on of CHRIST to the</HI> Gen|tiles, commonly called the Twelfth-Day, the <HI>Ea&s;tern Magi</HI> were guided by the Star, to pay their Homage to their Saviour; and becau&s;e they came that Day, which is the Twelfth after the Day of the Nativity, it is therefore called the <HI>Twelfth-Day.</HI></P>
<P>The Twelfth-Day it &s;elf is one of the great|e&s;t of the Twelve, and of more jovial Ob&s;er|vation than the Others, for the vi&s;iting of
<PB N="152" REF="171">
Friends and Chri&s;tmas-Gambols. The Rites of this Day are different in divers Places, tho' the End of them is much the &s;ame in all; namely, to do honour to the Memory of the <HI>Ea&s;tern Magi,</HI> whom they &s;uppo&s;e to have been Kings. In <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Gallia</HI> unus ex mini&s;tris, &amp;c.&mdash;Idem in <HI>Germa|nia,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Ho&s;pin. in Epiphan.</HI></NOTE> <HI>France,</HI> one of the Courtiers is cho&s;en King, whom the King him|&s;elf, and the other Nobles attend at an En|tertainment. In <HI>Germany,</HI> they ob&s;erve the &s;ame Thing on this Day in Academies and Cities, where the Students and Citizens create one of them&s;elves <HI>King,</HI> and provide a Magni|ficent Banquet for him, and give him the At|tendance of a <HI>King,</HI> or a <HI>&s;tranger Gue&s;t.</HI> Now this is an&s;werable to that Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Sa|turnalia,</HI> of <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> making <HI>Banquets</HI> for their <HI>Servants,</HI> and waiting on them; and no Doubt this Cu&s;tom has in Part &s;prung from that.</P>
<P>NOT many Years ago, this was a common <HI>Chri&s;tmas-Gambol</HI> in both our <HI>Univer&s;ities;</HI> and it is &s;till u&s;ual in other Places of our
<PB N="153" REF="172">
Land, to give the Name of <HI>King</HI> or <HI>Queen</HI> to that Per&s;on, who&s;e extraordinary Luck hits upon that Part of the divided <HI>Cake,</HI> which is honour'd above the others, with a <HI>Bean</HI> in it.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this be generally the greate&s;t of the Twelve, yet the others preceeding are ob&s;erved with Mirth and Jollity, generally to Exce&s;s. Was this Fea&s;ting confined within the Bounds of Decency and Moderation, and gave more way than it does to the Exerci&s;es and the Re|ligious Duties of the Sea&s;on, it would have nothing in it immoral or &s;inful. The keeping up of Friend&s;hip, and Love, and old Acquain|tance, has nothing in it harmful; but the Misfortune is, Men upon that Bottom, act ra|ther like Brutes than Men, and like Heathens than Chri&s;tians; and the Pre&s;ervation of Friend&s;hip and Love, is nothing el&s;e but a Pretence for Drunkenne&s;s, and Rioting, and Wantonne&s;s And &s;uch I am afraid hath been the Ob&s;ervation of the Chri&s;tmas-Holy-days, &s;ince the holie&s;t Times of the Chri&s;tian Church; and the generality of Men have rather look'd

<P>HOW St. <HI>Paul's Day</HI> came to have this par|ticular Knack of foretelling the good or evil
<PB N="161" REF="180">
Fortune of the following Year, is no ea&s;y Matter to find out. The Monks who were undoubtedly the fir&s;t who made this wonder|ful Ob&s;ervation, have taken Care it &s;hould be handed down to Po&s;terity, but why and for what Rea&s;on this Ob&s;ervation was to &s;tand good, they have taken Care to conceal. In Church Affairs indeed they make free with handing down <HI>Traditions</HI> from Generation to Generation, which being approved by an in|fallible Judgment, are to be taken for granted; but as far as I hear, they never pretended to an infallible Spirit, in the Study of the Pla|nets. One may therefore, without the Su&s;|picion of Here&s;y, or fear of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> make a little Inquiry into this Affair, and &s;ee whether it be true or fal&s;e, whether it is built upon any Rea&s;on or no Rea&s;on, whether &s;till to be ob&s;erved, or only laugh'd at as a Mon|ki&s;h Dream.</P>
<P>NOW as it is the Day of that Saint, <HI>the great Apo&s;tle St.</HI> Paul, I cannot &s;ee there is any Thing to be built upon. He did indeed <HI>labour more abundantly than all the Apo&s;tles;</HI> but ne|ver,
<PB N="162" REF="181">
that I heard, in the Science of A&s;trology. And why his Day &s;hould therefore be a &s;tand|ing <HI>Almanack</HI> to the World, rather than the Day of any other <HI>Saint,</HI> will be pretty hard to find out. I am &s;ure there is a good Num|ber of them, have as much Right to Rain or fair Weather as St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and if St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> &amp;c. have not as much Right to Wind or Snow, let the Reader judge.</P>
<P>AS it is the Twenty fifth Day of <HI>January,</HI> one would think that could be no Rea&s;on. For what is that Day more than another? In|deed they do give &s;ome Shew of Rea&s;on, why Rain &s;hould happen about the Time of St. <HI>Swithin,</HI> which is this. About the Time of his Fea&s;t, which is on the Fourteenth of <HI>July,</HI> there are two rainy <HI>Con&s;tellations,</HI> which are called <HI>Praecepe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ellus,</HI> which ari&s;e <HI>co&s;mi|cally,</HI> and generally produce Rain. And to be &s;ure in the Cour&s;e of the Sign <HI>Aquarius,</HI> there may be both Rain and Wind and fair Weather, but how the&s;e can foretell the De&s;tiny of the Year, is the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="182">AS then there is nothing in the <HI>Saint</HI> or his Day to progno&s;ticate any &s;uch Thing, I mean, as it is the Day of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> or the Twenty fifth of <HI>January,</HI> &s;o I mu&s;t confe&s;s I cannot find out what may be the Ground of this particular Ob&s;ervation. But however thus much is very obvious, that this Ob&s;ervation is an exact Copy of that &s;uper&s;titious Cu&s;tom a|mong the Heathens, of ob&s;erving one Day as good, and another as bad.

Thus have the <HI>Monks</HI> in the dark and unlear|ned Ages of Popery copy'd after the Heathens, and dream'd them&s;elves into the like Super&s;ti|tions, e&s;teeming one Day more &s;ucce&s;sful than another; and &s;o according to them, it is very unlucky to begin any Work upon <HI>Childerma&s;s-Day;</HI> and what Day &s;oever that falls on, whe|ther on a <HI>Munday, Tue&s;day,</HI> or any other, no|thing mu&s;t be begun on that Day through the Year; St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Day is the Year's <HI>Fortune-Teller,</HI>

he concludes, that all &s;uch Arts, whether of triffling or more noxious Super&s;tition, are to be rejected and avoided by Chri&s;tians, as proceeding originally from &s;ome pernici|ous Society between Men and Devils, and being the Compacts and Agreements of &s;uch treacherous and deceitful Friend&s;hip. The Apo&s;tle forbids us to have Fellow&s;hip with Devils; and that, he &s;ays, re&s;pects not only Idols, and Things offered to Idols, but all imaginary Signs pertaining to the Wor&s;hip of Idols, and al&s;o all Remedies, and other Ob&s;ervations, which are not appointed pub|lickly by GOD to promote the Love of GOD and our Neighbour, but proceed from the private Fancies of Men, and tend to delude the Hearts of poor deluded Mortals. For the&s;e Things have no natural Virtue in them, but owe all their Efficacy to a pre|&s;umptuous Confederacy with Devils: And they are full of pe&s;tiferous Curio&s;ity, tor|menting Anxiety, and deadly Slavery. They were fir&s;t taken up, not for any real Power to be di&s;cerned in them, but gained their Power by Mens ob&s;erving them. And there|fore

by the Devil's Art they happen dif|ferently to different Men, according to their own Apprehen&s;ions and Pre&s;umptions. For the great Deceiver knows, how to procure Things agreeable to every Man's Temper, and en&s;nare him by his own Su&s;picions and Con&s;ent.</Q></P>

<HI>June,</HI> which is the Eve of St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> Men and Woman were accu&s;tomed to gather together in the Evening by the Sea-&s;ide, or in &s;ome certain Hou&s;es, and there adorn a Girl, who was her Parents fir&s;t-begotten Child, af|ter the Manner of a Bride. Then they fea&s;t|ed and leaped after the Manner of <HI>Bacchanals,</HI> and danced and &s;houted as they were wont to do on their Holy-days: After this they poured into a narrow neck'd Ve&s;&s;el &s;ome of the Sea-Water, and put al&s;o into it certain Things be|longing to each of them. Then as if the Devil gifted the Girl, with the Faculty of telling future Things; they would enquire with a loud Voice, about the good or evil Fortune that &s;hould attend them: Upon this the Girl would take out of the Ve&s;&s;el, the fir&s;t Thing that came to Hand, and &s;hew it, and give it to the Owner; who upon receiv|ing it, was &s;o fooli&s;h as to imagine him&s;elf wi&s;er, as to the good or evil Fortune that &s;hould attend him.</P>

If therefore this Tradition hath any Meaning, it mu&s;t be a <HI>Metaphorical</HI> one; that when the Morning proves clear, there is a &s;eeming Smile over the Face of Nature, and Earth and Heaven &s;hew Tokens of Joy. For as the Earth and her Valleys, by &s;tanding thick with Corn, are &s;aid, <HI>to laugh and &s;ing;</HI> &s;o, on Account of the Re&s;urrection, the Heavens and the Sun may be &s;aid to Dance for Joy; or as the P&s;almi&s;t Words it, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xcvi. 11.

<P>THERE is then, really &s;peaking, nothing in the Dancing of the Sun upon <HI>Easter-Day;</HI> but yet it is a very ancient and commendable Cu&s;tom to be up early at this Holy Time: And therefore <HI>Dama&s;cen,</HI> in his <HI>Pa&s;chal Hymn,</HI>

<P>_ON the <HI>Eve of St.</HI> John Bapti&s;t, commonly called <HI>Mid&s;umner-Eve,</HI> it is u&s;ual in the mo&s;t of Country Places, and al&s;o here and there in <HI>Towns and Cities,</HI> for both Old and Young to meet together, and be Merry over a large Fire, which is made in the open Street. Over this they frequently leap and play at various Games, &s;uch as Run|ning, Wre&s;tling, Dancing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this is generally the Exerci&s;e of the younger Sort; for the old Ones, for the mo&s;t Part, &s;it by as

<P><HI>BELITHUS</HI> tells us, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Con&s;uetum item hac vigilia ardentes deferri faculas, quod <HI>Joannes</HI> fuerit ardens lucerna &amp; qui domini vias prae|paraverit. <HI>Belith.

But if this was the Rea&s;on of this Cu&s;tom formerly, as it's probable it was, (it having been a com|mon Thing, to &s;hadow out Times and Sea&s;ons by Emblems;) yet the Cu&s;tom &s;till continu'd among us, was originally in&s;tituted upon an|other Bottom.</P>

<PB N="212" REF="231">
being incited to Lu&s;t through the Heat of the Sea&s;on, did frequently, as they flew through the Air, Spermatize in the Wells and Fountains. By this Means the Water became infected, and the Air polluted; &s;o that who|ever drank the Waters, was either tormented with a grievious Di&s;temper, or lo&s;t his Life. As &s;oon as the Phy&s;icians perceived this, they ordered Fires to be made every where about the Wells and Fountains, and tho&s;e Things which occa&s;ioned the noi&s;ome&s;t Smell, to be burnt, knowing that thereby the Dragons would be driven away. And fora&s;much as this Cu&s;tom was ob&s;erved about the Time we now celebrate St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI>'s Fea&s;t, it is therefore &s;till ob&s;erved among &s;ome People. And agreeable to this it is, that Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> tells us, that <HI>Barnwell,</HI> a Village near <HI>Cam|bridge,</HI> got its Name from the Children play|ing about a <HI>Well</HI> on St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t's Eve.</HI></P>
<P>THE Cu&s;tom of kindling &s;uch Fires, was &s;everely cen&s;ur'd by the Church: And there|fore in the <HI>Council of Trulius,</HI> this Canon was
<PB N="213" REF="232">
made again&s;t it, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Can. <HI>65.</HI> in Synod. Trull. ex Bal&s;. P. <HI>440.</HI></NOTE> That if any Clergy-man or Lay-man ob&s;erved the Rite of making on Fires on the <HI>New-Moon,</HI> (which &s;ome were wont to ob&s;erve, and according to an old Cu&s;tom, to leap over them in a mad and fooli&s;h Man|ner,) he &s;hould be depo&s;ed, if the Former, if the Latter, he &s;hould be excommunicated.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Scholia&s;t</HI> upon this <HI>Canon</HI> hath the&s;e Words: The <HI>New-Moon</HI> was always the fir&s;t Day of the Month, and it was Cu&s;tomary a|mong the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Greeks,</HI> to hold then a Fea&s;t, and pray that they might be lucky du|ring the Continuance of the Month. Of the&s;e it was, that GOD &s;pake by the Prophet: My Soul hateth your <HI>New-Moons</HI> and your Sab|baths. And not only this, but they al&s;o kindled Fires before their Shops and Hou&s;es, and leaped over them; imagining that all the Evils which had befallen them formerly, would be burnt away, and that they &s;hould be more &s;ucce&s;sful and lucky afterwards. Now about the Sitting of this Synod, there were &s;ome of the Chri&s;tians, who ob&s;erved this Cu|&s;tom
<PB N="214" REF="233">
upon the &s;ame Accounts that the Hea|thens did, which occa&s;ioned it's being forbid by the Council; and that if a <HI>Clergy-man</HI> was Guilty of it, he &s;hould be depo&s;ed; if a <HI>Lay-man,</HI> excommunicated. He al&s;o tells us, that on St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t's-Eve,</HI> the Vulgar were wont to make on Fires for the whole Night, and leap over them, and draw Lots, and Divine about their good or evil Fortune.</P>
<P>BUT whatever Rea&s;on the Heathens had for kindling the&s;e Fires; whether as <HI>Duran|dus</HI> thinks, that the lu&s;tful <HI>Dragons</HI> might be driven away, or as the <HI>Canon,</HI> that their evil Fortune might be burnt, it is certain that the Cu&s;tom was invented and practi&s;ed by them; and becau&s;e of the Super&s;tion attending the Ob&s;ervation of it, was very ju&s;tly forbidden by the Council. And undoubtedly was the Making of &s;uch Fires now, attended with any &s;uch Super&s;tition, it would be equally crimi|nal to ob&s;erve them. But <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rogos&mdash;quos nos Angli <HI>Bonefires</HI> vocamus, &amp; in publica laetitia &amp; gaudiis adhibemus, non ob&s;tante i&s;to canone. <HI>Mountag.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXVIII.</HI> Of the Fea&s;t of Sheep-&s;hearing, an anci|ent Cu&s;tom.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Fea&s;t of Sheep-&s;heering, is generally a Time of Mirth and Joy, and more than or|dinary Ho&s;pitality; indeed it is but little ob&s;erved in the&s;e Northern Parts, but in the Southern it is pretty common. For on the Day they be|gin to &s;heer their Sheep, they provide a plen|tiful Dinner for the Sheerers, and for their Friends who come to vi&s;it them on that Occa|&s;ion; a Table al&s;o, if the Weather permit, is &s;pread in the open Village, for the young People and Children.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="236">AFTER what Manner &s;oever this Cu&s;tom reach'd us, it is certain it may boa&s;t of great Antiquity. It is mention'd in the Second Book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> as a Fea&s;t of great Magnifi|cence, both for Grandeur of Entertainment and Greatne&s;s of Company. No le&s;s a Per&s;on than <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> the King's Son was the Ma&s;ter of this Fea&s;t, and no le&s;s Per&s;ons were the Gue&s;ts than the King's Sons, the Brethren of <HI>Ab&s;alom;</HI> nay it was a Fea&s;t that might enter|tain the King him&s;elf, or &s;urely the King would never have been &s;o importun'd, never would have receiv'd the Compliment &s;o kindly. For 'tis &s;aid, <HI>It came to pa&s;s after two full Years, that</HI> Ab&s;alom <HI>had Sheep-&s;heerers in</HI> Baal|hazor, <HI>which is be&s;ide</HI> Ephraim, <HI>and</HI> Ab&s;alom <HI>invited all the King's Sons. And</HI> Ab&s;alom <HI>came to the King, and &s;aid, Behold, now thy Servant hath Sheep-&s;heerers, let the King, I be&s;eech thee, and his Servants, go with thy Servant. And the King &s;aid, Nay, my Son, let us not all go, le&s;t we be chargeable unto thee.</HI> Of this kind al&s;o was the Fea&s;t which <HI>Nabal</HI> made for his Sheerers, when <HI>David was driven</HI> to &s;traits in the Wilderne&s;s, and &s;ent his Servants to ask
<PB N="218" REF="237">
a Pre&s;ent of him. He calls the Day it was held on, a <HI>good Day;</HI> that is, a Day of plenti|ful Eating and Drinking. And therefore <HI>Na|bal</HI> an&s;wer'd the Servants of <HI>David, &s;hall I then take my Bread and my Water, and my Fle&s;h that I have killed for my Sheerers, and give it unto Men, whom I know not whence they be?</HI> And further, it is &s;aid in the &s;ame Chapter, that &s;o grand and magnificent was this Fea&s;t, <HI>that he had a Fea&s;t in his Hou&s;e, like the Fea&s;t of a King.</HI> We find al&s;o in the Book of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> that <HI>Laban</HI> went to &s;heer his Sheep, in which Time <HI>Jacob</HI> made his E&s;cape, which <HI>Laban</HI> heard not of till the third Day. Of &s;uch great Antiquity then is this Cu&s;tom, and tho' its Antiquity is not of &s;uch force as to pal|liate Luxury and Profu&s;ne&s;s in the&s;e Enter|tainments; yet no doubt it will vindicate the Harmle&s;ne&s;s of a moderate Fea&s;t upon this Occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>_THE Fea&s;t of this Sea&s;on is ce|lebrated in Commemoration of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> and all the Orders of Angels. It is cal|led, <HI>The Dedication of St. Michael,</HI> becau&s;e of a Church being dedicated to him on this Day in Mount <HI>Garganus.</HI></P>
<P>AT this Sea&s;on of the Year, it is a general Cu&s;tom to elect the Governors of <HI>Towns</HI> and <HI>Cities,</HI> to promote Peace among Men, and
<PB N="220" REF="239">
guard them again&s;t Harm from their malici|ous Fellow Creatures. Whether this particu|lar Time of the Year has been cho&s;en for e|lecting them, becau&s;e then is the Fea&s;t of An|gels, the Guardians and Protectors of Men, and of their Communities and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daniel, C. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE> Provinces, is not &s;o certain. It is certainer, that when ever it comes, it brings into the Minds of the Peo|ple, that old Opinion of <HI>Tutelar Angels,</HI> that every Man has his <HI>Guardian Angel;</HI> that is, one particular Angel who attends him from his Coming in, till his Going out of Life, who guides him through the Troubles of the World, and &s;trives as much as he can, to bring him to Heaven.</P>
<P>NOW that good Angels attend good Men is without Di&s;pute. They guide them in the Mazes of the Wilderne&s;s of Life, and bring them to their de&s;ir'd Homes; they &s;urround them in the Seas of Afflictions, and lead them to the Shores of Peace; and as when the <HI>I&s;|raelites</HI> pa&s;&s;ed through the Red-Sea, <HI>the Cloud became Light to them, but Darkne&s;s to their Ene|mies,</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="240">
&s;o in the trouble&s;ome Seas of this Life, the <HI>Angels</HI> are both the Guides of good Men, and their Protectors from Evil, from the De|vil and his Angels. And therefore the P&s;al|mi&s;t &s;ays, <HI>The Angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them; and that he will give his Angels Charge over good Men.</HI> They are al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed to be that Hedge, which GOD placed about <HI>Job,</HI> which the Devil &s;o much complains of; and &s;ure we are, that when the Eyes of <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI>'s Servant were open'd, <HI>he &s;aw the Mountain full of Chariots and Hor&s;es of Fire round about</HI> Eli|&s;ha. That therefore good Men are guarded and protected by Angels the Scripture &s;hews very clearly. But that every Man has his particular <HI>Genius,</HI> &s;eems to be founded more upon Tradition, than any Certainty from Scripture. Thus the <HI>Egyptians</HI> believed that every Man had three Angels attending him; the <HI>Pythagoreans,</HI> that every Man had two; the <HI>Romans,</HI> that there was a good and an evil <HI>Genius.</HI> And hence it is that the <HI>Roman</HI> Poet &s;ays, <HI>Qui&s;que &s;uos patitur manes,</HI> every Man hath his evil <HI>Genius.</HI> And if we may believe
<PB N="222" REF="241">
the Authority of <HI>Plutarch,</HI> the evil <HI>Genius</HI> of <HI>Brutus</HI> appeared to him the Night before the Battle of <HI>Philippi,</HI> and told him he was his evil Genius, and that he would meet him there.</P>
<P>BUT there are greater Authorities then the&s;e in Vindication of this Opinion: <HI>Ca&s;alion</HI> ob|&s;erves, it may be proved from Scripture, and not only from the Tradition of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Unicuique Deus cu&s;todem appo&s;uit; &amp; a&s;&s;erimus in|dubitanter nos ex &s;cripturis illam fidem, non gentium nugibus. <HI>Ca&s;&s;al.</HI> 217. <HI>P. de Vet. Chri&s;t. Rit.</HI></NOTE> Hea|thens. And of this Opinion was <HI>Ju&s;tin Mar|tyr, Theodoret,</HI> St. <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> and St. <HI>Au&s;tin.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are indeed two Places in the new Te&s;tament, which have a View to this Opini|on. The fir&s;t is in the 18th of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> the 10th Ver&s;e, <HI>Take heed that ye de&s;pi&s;e not one of the&s;e little Ones: For I &s;ay unto you, that their Angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in Heaven.</HI> Now becau&s;e this Place takes notice of the Angels of the&s;e little Ones, &s;ome have therefore concluded that
<PB N="223" REF="242">
every Man has his good Angel; at lea&s;t that good Men have. But now this Conclu&s;ion does not certainly follow from the&s;e Words: For when it is &s;aid <HI>their Angels,</HI> it does indeed certainly infer, that the Angels do protect good Men, but not that every Man has his particular Angel. And hence therefore, as one ob&s;erves, St. <HI>Chri&s;o&s;tom</HI> makes u&s;e of the&s;e Words, <HI>Enteuthen delon,</HI> &amp;c. it is manife&s;t that the Saints at lea&s;t, if not all Men, have their Angels: But he does not hence conclude, that every Man has one. The other Place is in the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles,</HI> where it is &s;aid, that when <HI>Peter</HI> was delivered out of Pri&s;on, they would not believe the Maid it was he, but &s;aid, <HI>It was his Angel.</HI> It mu&s;t be own'd in|deed from this, that it &s;eems the Opinion of tho&s;e in the Hou&s;e, that every Man had his <HI>Guardian Angel;</HI> but this is no Proof of the Things being &s;o: It only proves, that it was their Opinion, but not that this Opinion is true. The <HI>Jews</HI> had &s;uch a <HI>Tradition</HI> among them, and what was here &s;poken, was perhaps only according to that Tradition. Be&s;ides we read on the contrary, that &s;ometimes one and
<PB N="224" REF="243">
the &s;ame Angel has been &s;ent to different Per|&s;ons; thus <HI>Gabriel</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Daniel, Zacha|rias,</HI> and the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin: Sometimes the Scripture tells us of many Angels protecting one Man; for &s;o was <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> protected; and as we wre&s;tle <HI>not only again&s;t Fle&s;h and Blood, but again&s;t all the Powers of Darkne&s;s,</HI> &s;o we have many Angels to a&s;&s;i&s;t and defend us. I &s;hall not dare to determine po&s;itively again&s;t this Opinion, which has travelled down through &s;o many Ages, which has been held by &s;o many wi&s;e and learned Men, and which has &s;uch Scriptures brought to its Defence; this I &s;hall only &s;ay, that of the two Opinions, the Latter &s;eems to be the more probable; that it &s;eems more con&s;onant to Scripture, that we are attended by a Number of Angels, than by a particular <HI>Tutelar Angel.</HI> But this I menti|on, not as nece&s;&s;ary to be believed. For I am per&s;waded there is no fault in believing either the one or the other, as it appears more pro|bable: For whether &s;oever we believe, we be|lieve in the Protection of Angels, and that &s;eems to be all which the Scripture requires.</P>

Then the Inhabitants deck them&s;elves in their gaudie&s;t Clothes, and have open Doors and &s;plendid Entertainments, for the Reception and Treating of their Relations and Friends, who vi&s;it them on that Occa&s;ion, from each neighbouring Town. The Morn|ing is &s;pent for the mo&s;t Part at Church, tho' not as that Morning was wont to be &s;pent, not
<PB N="226" REF="245">
with the Commemoration of the <HI>Saint or Mar|tyr,</HI> nor the grateful Remembrance of the <HI>Buil|der and Endower.</HI> The remaining Part of the Day, is &s;pent in Eating and Drinking; and &s;o is al&s;o a Day or two afterwards, together with all Sorts of Rural Pa&s;times and Exerci&s;es, &s;uch as <HI>Dancing on the Green, Wre&s;tling, Cudgelling,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE to this we are told, that formerly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Die Dominic&acirc; po&s;t Encaeniam &s;eu Fe&s;tum Dedicati|onis cuju&s;vis villae convenire &s;olet in Auror&acirc; Magna ho|minum Iuvenumque multitudo, &amp; canora voce <HI>Holy-wakes, Holy-makes,</HI> Exclamando De&s;ignare, <HI>&amp;c.

<P>IN the <HI>Northren Parts,</HI> the Sunday's Fea&s;t|ing is almo&s;t lo&s;t, and they ob&s;erve only one other Day for the whole, which among them is called the <HI>Hopping;</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e from the dan|cing

and other Exerci&s;es then u&s;ed. The an|cient Name, and which is &s;till common in the Southern Parts, is the <HI>Wake;</HI> which according to Sir <HI>H. Spelman,</HI> are <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sunt celebritates Bacchanales &s;ub fructuum tempori|bus, ab occiduiis &amp; Borealibus Anglis pagatim Habitae. Bacchanales dixi ex nomine: Nam Wak.

His Words are the&s;e, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ut Die Dedicationis, vel Natalitiis Sanctorum Martyr|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um, quorum illic reliquiae ponuntur, tabernacula &s;ibi circa ea&s;dem Eccle&s;ias, quae ex Fanis commutatae &s;unt, de ramis arborum faciant, <HI>&amp;c.

<P>THIS then is the Beginning of our <HI>Country Wakes,</HI> but they continu'd not in their original Purity: For the Fea&s;ting and Sporting got the a&s;cendant of Religion, and &s;o this <HI>Fea&s;t of De|dication,</HI> degenerated into Drunkenne&s;s and Lux|ury. At pre&s;ent there is nothing left but the very Refu&s;e and Dregs of it; Religion having not the lea&s;t Share in it, which till the&s;e latter Ages always had &s;ome. Rioting and Fea&s;ting are now all that remain, a Scandal to the Fea&s;t in particular, and to Chri&s;tianity in general.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXI.</HI> Of the Harve&s;t Supper: A Cu&s;tom of the Heathens, taken from the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Fea&s;t of Tabernacles.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN the Fruits of the Earth are gather'd in, and laid in their proper Receptacles, it is common, in the mo&s;t of Country Places, to provide a plentiful Supper for the <HI>Harve&s;t-Men,</HI> and the Servants of the Family; which is called a <HI>Har|ve&s;t-Supper,</HI> and in &s;ome Places a <HI>Mell-Supper,</HI> a <HI>Churn Supper,</HI> &amp;c. At this the Servant and his Ma&s;ter are alike, and every Thing is done with an equal Freedom. They &s;it at the &s;ame Table, conver&s;e freely together, and &s;pend the remaining Part of the Night in dancing, &s;ing|ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without any Difference or Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="249">THERE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Antiquitus con&s;uetudo fuit apud <HI>Gentiles,</HI> quod hoc men&s;e &s;ervi pa&s;tores &amp; ancillae quadam libertate frueren|tur: Et cum Dominis &s;uis Dominarentur, &amp; cum eis fa|cerent fe&s;ta, &amp; convivia, po&s;t Collectas Me&s;&s;es. <HI>Durand.

<P>NOW the Original of both the&s;e Cu&s;toms, is <HI>Jewi&s;h:</HI> And therefore <HI>Ho&s;pinian</HI> tells us, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Et pro collectis frugibus Deo gratiae agebantur. Quem morem Ethnici po&s;tea abiis mutuati &s;unt. <HI>Ho&s;pin. de Orig. Fe&s;t. Jud. Stukius Antiq.

For the <HI>Jews</HI> rejoyced and fea&s;ted at the getting in of the Harve&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>THEOPHYLACT</HI> in talking of this Fea&s;t, is undoubtedly mi&s;taken, when he &s;ays, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Scenopegia, quod Celebrant in Gratiarum Actionem propter convectas Fruges in Men&s;e <HI>Septembri.</HI> Tunc e|nim gratias agebant Deo, convectis omnibus fructibus, <HI>&amp;c.

<PB N="231" REF="250">
Thanks might be returned for the getting in of the Fruits of the Earth. For GOD him&s;elf tells his own People, it was in&s;tituted, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Levit. 23.&mdash;</NOTE> <HI>that their Generations might know, that he had made the Children of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>to dwell in Booths.</HI> But however, it is certainly true, that it was a Time of returning Thanks to GOD, for the Succe&s;s of the Harve&s;t, a Time of Fe&s;tivity, and Joy and Gladne&s;s, Thus the Scripture, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Thou &s;halt ob&s;erve the Fea&s;t of Tabernacles &s;even Days, after thou ha&s;t gather'd in thy Corn and thy Wine. And thou &s;halt rejoyce in thy Fea&s;t, thou and thy Son and thy Daughter, and thy Man-Servant, and thy Maid-Servant; and the Levite, the Stranger, and the Fatherle&s;s and the Widow, that are within thy Gates.</HI></P>
<P>NOW as the Heathens have imitated the <HI>Jews</HI> in this Cu&s;tom, &s;o it is not improbable that we have had it from the <HI>Heathens;</HI> there being a very great Likene&s;s between the Cu|&s;tom now, and that of the Heathens formerly.
<PB N="232" REF="251">

But whatever Truth there is in this, it is certain this Cu&s;tom was practi|&s;ed by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and is at lea&s;t as Ancient among&s;t us, as their Days.
