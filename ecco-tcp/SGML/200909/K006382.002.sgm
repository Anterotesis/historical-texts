<HEAD>THE RIGHT AND CAPACITY OF THE PEO|PLE TO JUDGE OF GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>From</HI> CATO'S LETTERS.</P>
<P>HONESTY and plainne&s;s go together, and the makers and multipliers of my&s;teries, in the political way, are &s;hrewdly to be &s;u&s;pected of dark de|&s;igns. <HI>Cincinatus</HI> was taken from the plough to &s;ave and defend the <HI>Roman</HI> State; an office which he executed hone&s;tly and &s;ucce&s;sfully, without the grimace and gains of a &s;tate&s;man. Nor did he afterwards continue ob&s;ti|nately at the head of affairs, to form a party, rai&s;e a fortune, and &s;ettle him&s;elf in power: As he came into it with univer&s;al con&s;ent, he re&s;igned it with univer&s;al applau&s;e.</P>
<P>It &s;eems that government was not in tho&s;e days become a trade, at lea&s;t a gainful trade&mdash;hone&s;t <HI>Cin|cinatus</HI> was but a farmer: and happy had it been for the <HI>Romans,</HI> if, when they were en&s;laved, they could have taken the admini&s;tration out of the hands of the emperors, and their refined politicians, and com|mitted it to &s;uch farmers, or any farmers. It is certain, that many of their imperial governors acted more ridiculou&s;ly than a board of ploughmen would have done, and more barbarou&s;ly than a club of butchers could have done.</P>
<P>But &s;ome have &s;aid, <HI>it is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of private men to meddle with government.</HI> A bold, fal&s;e, and di&s;hone&s;t &s;aying; and whoever &s;ay it, either knows not what he &s;ays, or cares not, or &s;lavi&s;hly &s;peaks the &s;en&s;e of others. It is a cant now almo&s;t forgot in England, and which never prevailed but when liberty and the con&s;titution were attacked, and never can prevail but upon the like occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>It is a vexation to be obliged to an&s;wer non&s;en&s;e, and confute ab&s;urdities:</HI> but &s;ince it is and has been the great de&s;ign of this paper to maintain and explain the
<PB N="4" REF="5">glorious principles of liberty, and to expo&s;e the arts of tho&s;e who would darken or de&s;troy them; I &s;hall here particularly &s;hew the wickedne&s;s and &s;tupidity or the above &s;aying; which is fit to come from no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ath but that of a tyrant, or a &s;lave, and can never be h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d by any man of an hone&s;t and free &s;oul with|out ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and indignation: It is, in &s;hort a &s;aying, which ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ender the man, who utters it for ever incapable of place or credit in a free country, as it &s;hews the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lignity of his heart, and the ba&s;ene&s;s of his nature, and as it is the pronouncing of a doom upon our con&s;titution&mdash;a crime, or rather a compli|cation of crimes, for which a la&s;ting infamy ought to be but part of the puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>But to the fal&s;hood of the thing: Public truths ought never to be kept &s;ecrets; and they who do it, are guilty of a &s;oleci&s;m, and a contradiction: Every man ought to know what it concerns all to know. Now, nothing upon earth is of a more univer&s;al na|ture th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n government; and every private man upon ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch has a concern in it, becau&s;e in it is concerned, and nearly and immediately concerned, his virtue, his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">erty, and the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on: And where all the&s;e are be&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;erved and advanced, the government is be&s;t adm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;tred; and where they are not, the government is impotent, wicked or unfor|tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d where the government is &s;o, the people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> there being always and every where a cer|tain &s;ympathy and analogy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etween the nature of the government and the nature of the pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple. This holds true in every in&s;tance. Public men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re the patterns of private; and the virtues and vices of the governors become quickly the virtues and vices of the go|verned.</P>
<P>Nor is it example alone that does it. Ill govern|ments, &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting by vice and rapine, are jealous of private virtue, and enemies to private property. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> mu&s;t be wicked and mi&s;chievous to be what they are; not are they &s;ecure while any thing good
<PB N="5" REF="6">and valuable is &s;ecure. Hence it is, that to drain, worry, and debauch their &s;ubjects, are the &s;teady maxims of their politics, their favourite arts of reigning. In this wretched &s;ituation, the people, to be &s;afe, mu&s;t be poor and lewd: there will be but little indu&s;try, where property is precarious; &s;mall hone&s;ty, where virtue is dangerous.</P>
<P>Profu&s;ene&s;s, or frugality, and the like virtues or vices, which affect the public, will be practi&s;ed in the city, if they be practi&s;ed in the court; and in the country, if they be in the city. Even <HI>Nero</HI> (that royal mon&s;ter in man's &s;hape) was adored by the common herd at <HI>Rome,</HI> as much as he was flattered by the great; and both the little and the great ad|mired, or pretended to admire his manners, and many to imitate them. <HI>Tacitus</HI> tells us, that tho&s;e &s;ort of people long lamented him, and rejoiced in the choice of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or that re&s;embled him, even the profligate <HI>Otho.</HI></P>
<P>Good government does, on the contrary, pro|duce great virtue, much happine&s;s, and many peo|ple. <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> while they continued free, were each of them, for the number of inhabitants, like one continued city; for virtue, knowledge, and great men, they were the &s;tandards of the world; and that age and country that could come neare&s;t to them, has ever &s;ince been reckoned the happie&s;t. Their government, their free government, was the root of all the&s;e advantages, and of all this felicity and renown; and in the&s;e great and fortunate &s;tates, the people were the principals in the govern|ment; laws were made by their judgment and au|thority, and by their voice and commands were ma|gi&s;trates made and condemned. The city of <HI>Rome</HI> could conquer the world; nor could the great <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Monarch, the greate&s;t then upon earth, &s;tand before the face of one <HI>Greek</HI> City.</P>
<P>But what are <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> now? <HI>Rome</HI> has in it a herd of pampered monks, and a few &s;tarving lay
<PB N="6" REF="7">inhabitants; the <HI>Campania</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> the fine&s;t &s;pot of earth in <HI>Europe,</HI> is a de&s;art. And for the modern <HI>Greeks,</HI> they are a few abject contemptible &s;laves, kept under ignorance, chains, and vilene&s;s, by the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Monarch, who keeps a great part of the globe inten&s;ely mi&s;erable, that he may &s;eem great without being &s;o.</P>
<P>Such is the difference between one government and another, and of &s;uch important concernment is the nature and admini&s;tration of government to a people. And to &s;ay that private men have nothing to do with government, is to &s;ay that private men have nothing to do with their own happine&s;s and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>One man, or a few men, have often pretended the public, and meant them&s;elves, and con&s;ulted their own per&s;onal intere&s;t, in in&s;tances e&s;&s;ential to its well-being; but the whole people, by con|&s;ulting their own intere&s;t, con&s;ult the public, and act for the public by acting for them&s;elves: this is particularly the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution, in which the whole nation is repre&s;ented; and our records afford in&s;tances, where the hou&s;e of commons have declined entering upon a que&s;tion of importance, till they had gone into the country, and con&s;ulted their principles, the people: &s;o far were they from think|ing that private men had no right to meddle with government. In truth; our whole worldly happine&s;s and mi&s;ery (abating for accidents and di&s;ea&s;es) are owing to the order and mi&s;management of govern|ment; and he who &s;ays that private men have no concern with government, does wi&s;ely and mode&s;tly tell us, that men have no concern in that which con|cerns them mo&s;t; it is &s;aying that people ought not to concern them&s;elves whether they be naked or clothed, fed or &s;tarved. deceived or in&s;tructed, and whether they be protected or de&s;troyed: What non|&s;en&s;e and &s;ervitude in a <HI>free</HI> and <HI>wi&s;e</HI> nation!</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">For my&s;elf, who have thought pretty much on the&s;e matters, I am of opinion that a whole nation are like to be as much attached to them&s;elves, as one man or a few men are like to be. who may be many means be detached from the intere&s;t of a nation. It is certain that one man, and &s;everal men, may be bribed into an intere&s;t, oppo&s;ite to that of the public; but it is as certain, that a whole country can never find an equi|valent for it&s;elf, and con&s;equently <HI>a whole country can never be bribed.</HI> It is the eternal intere&s;t of every nation, that their government &s;hould be good; but they who direct it, frequently rea&s;on a contrary way, and find their own account in plunder and oppre&s;&s;ion; and while the public voice is pretended to be de|clared, by one or a few, for vile and private ends, the public knows nothing what is done, till they feel the terrible effects of it.</P>
<P>By the Bill of Rights, and the Act of Settlement at the <HI>Revolution,</HI> a right is a&s;&s;erted to the people of applying to the King and to the parliament by peti|tion and addre&s;s, for a redre&s;s of public grievances and mi&s;managements, when &s;uch there are, of which They are left to judge: and the difference between free and en&s;laved countries lies principally here, that in the former, their magi&s;trates mu&s;t con&s;ult the voice and intere&s;t of the people: but in the latter, the private will, intere&s;t, and plea&s;ure of the governors, are the &s;ole end and motives of their admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>Such is the difference between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Turky;</HI> which difference, they who &s;ay that private men have no right to concern them&s;elves with government, would ab&s;olutely de&s;troy; they would convert ma|gi&s;trates into ba&s;haws, and introduce popery into politics. The late revolution &s;tands upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">very oppo&s;ite maxim; and that any man dares to contra|dict it &s;ince the <HI>Revolution,</HI> would be amazing, did we not know that there are, in every country, hire|lings who would betray it for a &s;op.</P>

<P>HOW di&s;gu&s;ting is a &s;tate of &s;ociety, when we ob&s;erve men either tearing one another in pieces by violence; or taking every unju&s;t means to undermine each other by cunning and treachery, each acts as if his <HI>only</HI> aim were the total extirpation of his &s;pecies! how &s;hocking the idea! that of all the animals &s;cattered over this va&s;t globe, man is the mo&s;t ferocious.</P>
<P>Seldom or never do we &s;ee the mo&s;t &s;avage ani|mals wage war with tho&s;e of the &s;ame kind: that is a refinement in cruelty of which man only is ca|pable.

<P>Methought I was tran&s;ported to a large plain, green, flowery, and watered with innumerable rivulets; who&s;e gentle murmurs formed an agreeable concert with the &s;weet notes of &s;ong&s;ters which flut|tered upon their verdant banks.&mdash;The inhabitants of this delightful place were divided into a number of different &s;ocieties; each governed by its own par|ticular monarch.&mdash;As I was walking among them, ob&s;erving their manners and cu&s;toms, which I found were quite different, notwith&s;tanding their near con|nection; between &s;ome only a &s;light barrier; others had even but &s;mall rivulets to fix their boundaries. I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee them con&s;tantly wrang|ling and engaged in quarrels; &s;ometimes for the lea&s;t trifle; &s;uch as the <HI>ducks</HI> of one di&s;trict &s;wim|ming in a <HI>pool</HI> belonging to another: or perhaps to &s;atisfy the fooli&s;h caprice of &s;ome of the <HI>great men</HI>&mdash;for in each &s;ociety was a great number who were called <HI>Satellites</HI> of their re&s;pective crowns; who, as other &s;econdary planets derive their lu&s;tre from &s;ome primary planet, &s;o they received their authority from the crown, and di&s;pen&s;ed it to the people without the lea&s;t diminution. I was equally &s;urpri&s;ed at the <HI>an|dacity</HI> of the one, and the <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> obedience of the other. But my wonder &s;omewhat abated when I &s;aw their different manner of handling a controver&s;y: the multitude wholly unacquainted with the wiles of logic, had nothing to &s;upport their cau&s;e but a parcel of phra&s;es and words now entirely ob&s;olete; &s;uch as <HI>rea&s;on, humanity,</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> with a long li&s;t of anti|quated etceteras: whereas, on the other &s;ide, the <HI>mo|narchs</HI> and their <HI>jack<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lls</HI> had a notable way of arguing,
<PB N="10" REF="11">namely, by <HI>torture, whips, racks, gibbets, gallies, dun|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> and many other &s;yllogi&s;ms of the &s;ame kind. This manner of <HI>per&s;ua&s;ion,</HI> or rather <HI>compul&s;ion,</HI> may pro|perly be called the <HI>logic of tyrants.</HI> Pain they main|tained was much better for clearing the under&s;tand|ing than rea&s;on; the latter actuating but &s;lowly, whil&s;t the other was almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous. Having walked a little further, I gained a &s;mall &s;pot entirely &s;urrounded by water: here, thought I, <HI>Peace</HI> mu&s;t have her re&s;idence; no longer &s;hall my ears be grated with the horrid din of war; my eyes &s;hall not here behold the tears of the widow, with her children clung round her, bewailing the lo&s;s of a fond hu&s;band and tender father, torn by force from their arms.&mdash; But gue&s;s my a&s;toni&s;hment, at finding them the mo&s;t litigious and quarrel&s;ome party I had yet met with: and though they boa&s;ted of being free, were &s;o <HI>only</HI> in idea! I wondered much how they were &s;o ea&s;ily duped, &s;eeing no force u&s;ed, not &s;o much as a threat: they were even &s;aid to have the reins of Government in their own hands, and allowed to drive at plea&s;ure. But their Monarch took a &s;afer way of arguing them out of their liberties, though not le&s;s &s;ure than that practi&s;ed in the other &s;ocieties through which I pa&s;|&s;ed&mdash;I mean convincing by ready money; or, as &s;ome call it, <HI>bribing a man to an opinion.</HI> Experience has proved this to be the mo&s;t effectual method. <HI>Argu|ments from the mint</HI> will per&s;uade much &s;ooner than tho&s;e drawn from <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>philo&s;ophy.</HI> Gold is a wonderful clearer of the under&s;tanding. It &s;atisfies every doubt in an in&s;tant; &s;ilences the clamorous; &s;tops the mouth of the orator; brings over the mo&s;t inflexible &s;tate&s;man; and, in &s;hort, is capable of argu|ing men out of all their liberties.</P>
<P>Wi&s;hing to &s;ee one of the&s;e <HI>&s;upernatural beings</HI> called <HI>monarchs,</HI> I advanced towards a palace which &s;tood at a little di&s;tance. At the gate was placed a number of guards, cloathed with all the tawdry pomp of power, in order to &s;trike with awe the
<PB N="11" REF="12">beholders. They permitted me to pa&s;s into a large hall, the walls thereof were gilded all for &s;how. At the upper end of the hall was a throne &s;upported by magical contrivance upon a few <HI>gothic pillars.</HI> On one pillar I ob&s;erved the word <HI>&s;uper&s;tition,</HI> on another <HI>divine right.</HI> The&s;e two were in many places nearly mouldered to pieces; &s;o that the throne actu|ally tottered, and mu&s;t have fallen, had it not been &s;upported by a third pillar of that fa&s;cinating metal called <HI>gold;</HI> who&s;e lu&s;tre dazzled the eyes of mo&s;t of the beholders, to &s;uch a degree, that they were un|able to ob&s;erve either the in&s;criptions or defects of the other two. The throne was covered with a canopy, which glittered with all the riches which pomp could invent. Under it &s;at DESPOTISM, arrayed in all the gorgeous trappings of <HI>arrogance</HI> and <HI>power. Folly</HI> ho|vered around his crown; ambition &s;at like a &s;pread eagle on the top of his &s;cepter; and vanity &s;upported the &s;kirt of his train.

Wondering what would be the con&s;equence, I &s;aw one who was an entire &s;tranger here, a grave, decent old man, called PLAIN DEALING, get up and harangue the multitude, in the following terms:</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">"Citizens.</P>
<P>"We are oppre&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e we have no &s;hare in our government. Let us cea&s;e to petition for our rights; let us blu&s;h to bend the knee, and &s;upplicate like beggars, for what nature bequeathed to us at our birth. Let us &s;peak in a tone that virtuous go|vernors will hear, and tyrannical ones tremble at. They tell us we have liberty: yes, two or three hundred citizens have the liberty of lording it over all the others; of making and repealing laws at plea&s;ure; of engro&s;&s;ing dignities, ranks and honours; of inve&s;ting them&s;elves with the principal employ|ments of the &s;tate, and di&s;po&s;ing of the public re|venue.</P>
<P>"Can liberty be applied to a people who have no part in the government of them&s;elves, or their repre|&s;entatives? We are no farther free than as we have a &s;hare in the admini&s;tration, and are a branch of the national council. How intolerable to have in&s;ult added to &s;lavery! to be even challenged to prove our wrongs! alas! a ta&s;k but too ea&s;y. Are not many of our fellow-citizens &s;hamefully excluded from all political tru&s;ts, by acts which reward fal&s;ehood and puni&s;h hone&s;ty; which u&s;urp the dominion of that God whom they pretend to revere? Are we not loaded with <HI>taxes</HI> which wring from the poor pea&s;ant great part of his hard-earned pittance, to &s;upport fooli&s;h and profligate wars, entered into with all the madne&s;s of political <HI>quixot&s;m;</HI> and which threaten our po&s;terity with calamities unparalelled in any age?&mdash;Is there not an increa&s;ing corruption in the admini&s;tration of government? is not the repre|&s;entative hou&s;e of the people become a chamber only for regi&s;tering mini&s;terial edicts? has there not been every attempt made to &s;ilence that guardian of our liberty&mdash;the pre&s;s; without which, governors and their minions, might with impunity trample on for|malities, the pretended bulwark of our freedom? is not the equipoi&s;e in our legi&s;lature the mere cant

<P>"They pretend we have a con&s;titution, but nobody knows the mechani&s;m of it. The laws re&s;emble a chaos, jumbled into as many large volumes as would take a man during his life to read. Except a few capital crimes, as murder and theft, we are not &s;en&s;i|ble when we tre&s;pa&s;s, until the lawyers (tho&s;e <HI>blood|&s;uckers</HI> of &s;ociety) apprize us of it by proce&s;s; our &s;entence follows hard on the commi&s;&s;ion of it, &s;o that we are often puni&s;hed for pretended crimes, without ever knowing we were doing the lea&s;t wrong. There is no criterion whereby we can di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>laws</HI> from <HI>dictates; that criterion being an expre&s;&s;ion of the general will,</HI> IS WANTING.

<HEAD>CHARACTER OF AN EVIL MAGISTRATE, <HI>From</HI> ALGERNON SIDNEY, <HI>E&s;q.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN a Magi&s;trate fancies he is not made for the people, but the people for him; that he does not govern for them, but for him&s;elf; that the people live only to encrea&s;e his glory, or to furni&s;h matter for his plea&s;ure; he does not enquire what he may <HI>do for</HI> them, but what he may <HI>draw from</HI> them: by this means he &s;ets up an intere&s;t of profit, plea&s;ure, or pomp in him&s;elf, repugnant to the good of the public, for which he is made to be what he is. The&s;e contrary ends certainly divide the nation into parties; and while every one endeavours to advance that to which he is addicted, occa&s;ions of hatred, for injuries every day do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, or thought to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> re|ceived, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e. This creaces a mo&s;t &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and irreconcilable enmity: becau&s;e the occa&s;ions are frequent, important, and univer&s;al, and the cau&s;es thought to be mo&s;t ju&s;t. The people think it to be the greate&s;t of all crimes to convert that power to their h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, which was in&s;tituted for their good; and that the inju&s;tice is aggravated by perjury and in|gratitude, which comprehend all manner of ill; and the Magi&s;trate gives the name of &s;edition and rebel|lion to what&s;oever they do for the pre&s;ervation of them&s;elves and their rights. When men's &s;pirits are thus prepared, a &s;mall matter &s;ets them on fire; but if no acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nt happens to bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> them into a flame, the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice is certainly interrupted, the public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> its are neglected; and when any occa&s;ion, whether foreign or dome&s;tic, ari&s;es in which the Magi&s;trate &s;tands in need of the people's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they who&s;e affections are alienated; not only &s;hew an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;erve him with their per&s;ons and e&s;tates, but fear that by delivering him from his di&s;tre&s;s they &s;trong then their enemy, and enable him
<PB N="17" REF="18">to oppre&s;s them; and he fancying his will to be un|ju&s;tly oppo&s;ed, or his due more unju&s;tly denied, is filled with a di&s;like of what he &s;ees, and a fear of wor&s;e for the future. Whil&s;t he endeavours to ea&s;e him&s;elf of the one, and to provide again&s;t the other, he u&s;ually encrea&s;es the evils of both; and jealou&s;ies are on both &s;ides multiplied. Every man knows that the governed are in a great mea&s;ure under the power of the governor; but as no man or number of men is willingly &s;ubject to tho&s;e that &s;eek their ruin, &s;uch as fall into &s;o great a misfortune, continue no longer under it, than force, fear, or nece&s;&s;ity may be able to oblige them. But &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity can hardly be longer upon a great people, than till the evil be fully di&s;covered and comprehended, and their virtue, &s;trength, and power be united to expell it: The ill Magi&s;trate looks upon all things that may conduce to that end, as &s;o many preparatives to his ruin; and by the help of tho&s;e who are of his party, will endeavour to prevent that union, and dimini&s;h that &s;trength, virtue, power, and courage, which he knows to be bent again&s;t him. And as truth, faithful dealing, and integrity of manners are bands of union, and helps to good, he will always, by tricks, artifices, cavils, and all means po&s;&s;ible, en|deavour to e&s;tabli&s;h fal&s;hood and di&s;hone&s;ty; whil&s;t other emi&s;&s;aries and in&s;truments of iniquity, by cor|rupting the youth, and &s;uch as can be brought to le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dne&s;s and debauchery, bring the people to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that they may neither care nor dare to vindi|cate their rights; and that tho&s;e who would do it may &s;o far &s;u&s;pect each other, as not to confer upon, much le&s;s to join in, any action tending to the public deliverance.</P>
<P>This di&s;tingui&s;hes the good from the bad Magi|&s;trate, the faithful from the unfaithful; and tho&s;e that adhere to either, living in the &s;ame principle, mu&s;t wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in the &s;ame ways. They who uphold the rightful power of a ju&s;t Magi&s;tracy, encourage virtue

On the other &s;ide, he that would introduce an ill Magi&s;trate, make one evil who was good, or pre&s;erve him in the admini&s;tration of inju&s;tice when he is corrupted, mu&s;t always open the way for him by vitiating the people, corrupting their manners, de&s;troying the validity of oaths, teaching &s;uch eva|&s;ions, equivocations, and fraud, as are incon&s;i&s;tant with the thoughts that become men of virtue and courage; and overthrowing the confidence they ought to have in each other, make it impo&s;&s;ible for them to unite among&s;t them&s;elves. The like arts mu&s;t be u&s;ed with the Magi&s;trate: He cannot be for their turns, till he is per&s;uaded to believe he has no dependence upon, and owes no duty to the people; that he is of him&s;elf, and not by their in&s;titution: that no man ought to enquire into, nor be judge of his actions; that all obedience is due to him, whe|ther he be good or bad, wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, a father or an enemy to his country. This being calculated for his per&s;onal intere&s;t, he mu&s;t pur&s;ue the &s;ame de&s;igns, or his kingdom is divided within it&s;elf, and cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t. By this means, tho&s;e who flatter his hu|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur, court to be accounted his friends, and the only men that are thought worthy of great tru&s;ts; while &s;uch as are of another mind are expo&s;ed to all p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tion.

Tho&s;e who are ignorant of all good, carele&s;s, or enemies to it, take a more compendious way: their &s;lavi&s;h, vicious, and ba&s;e natures inclining them to &s;eek only private and pre&s;ent advantage, they ea&s;ily &s;lide into a blind dependence upon one who has wealth and power; and de&s;iring only to know his will, care not what inju&s;tice they do if they may be rewarded. They wor&s;hip what they find in the temple, though it be the vile&s;t of idols; and always like that be&s;t which is wor&s;t, becau&s;e it agrees with their inclinations and principles.

<P>WHO are tho&s;e who make the &s;treets their couch, and find a &s;hort repo&s;e from wretched|ne&s;s at the doors of the opulent? The&s;e are &s;trang|ers, wanderers, and orphans, who&s;e circum&s;tances are too humble to expect redre&s;s, and who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es are too great even for pity. Their wretchedne&s;s ex|cites rather horror than pity. Some are without the covering even of rags, and others emaciated with di&s;ea&s;e; the world has di&s;claimed them; &s;ociety turns its back upon their di&s;tre&s;s, and has given them up to nakedne&s;s and hunger. The&s;e poor &s;hivering females have once &s;een happier days, and been flat|tered into beauty. They have been pro&s;tituted to THE GAY LUXURIOUS VILLAIN, and are now turned out to meet the &s;everity of winter. Perhaps, now lying at the doors of their betrayers, they &s;ue to wretches who&s;e hearts are in&s;en&s;ible, or debau|chee; who may cur&s;e, but will not relieve them.</P>
<P>Why, why was I born a man, and yet &s;ee the &s;ufferings of wretches I cannot relieve! Poor hou&s;e|le&s;s creatures! the world will give you reproaches, but will not give you relief. The &s;lighte&s;t misfor|tunes of the great, the mo&s;t imaginary unea&s;ine&s;s of
<PB N="23" REF="24">the rich, are aggravated with all the power of elo|quence, and held up to engage our attention and &s;ympathetic &s;orrow. The poor weep unheeded, per|&s;ecuted by every &s;ubordinate &s;pecies of tyranny; and <HI>every law which gives others &s;ecurity becomes an enemy to them.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ON THE FOLLY OF KINGS.</HEAD>

<Q>Woe to thee, O Land! when thy King is a child, and thy Princes eat in the morning!
<BIBL><HI>ECCLE. X. ver. 16.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a vulgar proverb, that &s;ome people are twice children; this is &s;ometimes the lot of kings, and was the ca&s;e of the &s;on of Solomon, the &s;on of David. This Prince was forty and one years old when he came to the kingdom, and was a child of a pretty competent age; but notwith&s;tanding his number of years, his folly &s;hewed him to be but a child. It will be nece&s;&s;ary to illu&s;trate this Prince's childhood in a few particulars.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, He ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to redre&s;s the griev|ances of his people, and threatened to encrea&s;e them. Though money was plenty in the days of Solomon, the people were poor; gold and &s;ilver were plenty in Jeru&s;alem, and near the king's court, but it does not &s;eem to have circulated as far as Shechem, and the extremities of Pala&s;tine. The real wealth of nations does not con&s;i&s;t in a large quantity of &s;pecie, but in a proper balance of the value of mo|ney with the price of u&s;eful commodities. Solomon was rich, but his &s;ubjects were poor and oppre&s;&s;ed. The misfortune of Solomon's government, for all the
<PB N="24" REF="25">wi&s;dom that he had, was, that he brought more luxu|ries into the nation than commodities profitable for the &s;ervice of the people. He was al&s;o very extrava|gant in his hou&s;hold expences, and the charges of his government. <HI>"His provi&s;ion for one day was thirty mea&s;ures of fine flour, and three&s;core mea&s;ures of meal; ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pa&s;ture, and an hundred &s;heep, be&s;ides harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fatted fowls. He had al&s;o forty thou&s;and &s;talls for hor&s;es, for chariots, and twelve thou&s;and hor&s;emen."</HI> This was a mon&s;trous peace e&s;tabli&s;hment. What a dreadful expence mu&s;t this have been to the nation!</P>
<P>Under all this &s;hew of wealth and &s;plendor in the king, the people were poor, and greatly oppre&s;&s;ed. They therefore came to the new king, to a&s;k a re|dre&s;s of their grievances, and to have their burdens made lighter. But he an&s;wered them roughly, and would not li&s;ten to their humble petition. <HI>They &s;pake unto him, &s;aying, Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make thou the grievous &s;ervice of thy fa|ther, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter, and we will &s;erve thee.</HI> There was nothing unrea|&s;onable in all this; it was a very mode&s;t reque&s;t, and none, except a <HI>child</HI> or a <HI>fool,</HI> would have refu&s;ed it. Solomon &s;eems to have had &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of his &s;on before he died; for he &s;ays, <HI>he hated all his labour, becau&s;e he was to leave it to the man that &s;hould come after him, and he knew not whether he would be a wi&s;e man or a fool.</HI> What his father was afraid of he now &s;hewed publicly, in refu&s;ing the reque&s;t of his people, who promi&s;ed willingly to &s;erve him, pro|vided he would enable them to do it when it was in his power. Could any thing be more childi&s;h than to continue an expen&s;ive government, and an enor|mous civil li&s;t, when all ranks of per&s;ons were groan|ing under burdens, and complaining of oppre&s;&s;ion? The complaints of the people are not to be trifled with; for if princes will not relieve them, they will
<PB N="25" REF="26">them&s;elves, and the Almighty will help them to do it. It was a mo&s;t childi&s;h action in that weak Prince to refu&s;e &s;uch a rea&s;onable petition, which was alto|gether for his own intere&s;t to grant; for the people promi&s;ed to &s;erve him if he would ea&s;e them a little; &s;o he might have &s;aved all by a little conde&s;cen&s;ion, which he lo&s;t through wilfulne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy. What can princes imagine the people are made of, when they treat them &s;o ridiculou&s;ly? they mu&s;t &s;urely think that they are not creatures of like pa&s;|&s;ions with them&s;elves, otherwi&s;e they would &s;oon conclude, that they would not &s;uffer the treatment which they often give them.</P>
<P>Secondly, This Prince refu&s;ed the advice of his father's aged and wi&s;e coun&s;ellors. <HI>They &s;pake unto him &s;aying, if thou wilt be a &s;ervant to this people, and will &s;erve them, then they will be thy &s;ervants for ever.</HI> They de&s;erved every one a pen&s;ion for this advice; but &s;uch words of wi&s;dom &s;eldom meet with acceptance or preferment from childi&s;h princes. Tho&s;e old &s;ages knew the office and duty of a king. It is only that of a <HI>public &s;ervant</HI> to the community, by fulfilling of which, they &s;ecure the love and obedience of their &s;ubjects for ever, which is the be&s;t &s;ecurity. This wi&s;e coun&s;el did not &s;uit the humour of this <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> and <HI>childi&s;h</HI> Prince. The word <HI>&s;ervant</HI> &s;ounded har&s;h in his de&s;potic ears&mdash;A king to be a &s;ervant! how uncourtly the thought! how unroyal the idea! tho&s;e coun&s;ellors could not expect to continue long in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice; they were far too hone&s;t and free in their advice, to &s;uit the cabinet of a <HI>childi&s;h</HI> and <HI>ob&s;tinate</HI> &s;overeign. They, however, di&s;charged their duty, and gave the be&s;t proofs of their regard and love to their Prince and their Country. Tho&s;e old men knew the &s;tate of the nation, and were well per&s;uaded that the people would not long &s;uffer the oppre&s;&s;ions they were groaning under; they under&s;tood that many things had been now warped into government that were
<PB N="26" REF="27">contrary to the con&s;titution of the Kingdom. The law &s;aid, <HI>that the King &s;hould not multiply hor&s;es, nor make the people return to Egypt for that purpo&s;e, neither was he to multiply to him&s;elf &s;ilver and gola.</HI> Solomon had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed in all the&s;e re&s;pects, and more than all, he had been guilty of idolatry, and had not walked in the &s;tatutes of God, like David his Father. The&s;e were all flagrant breaches of the con&s;titution, which the old men knew were unwarrantable, and that the Lord would not &s;uffer to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed if they were per&s;i&s;ted in. They al&s;o knew that the people's claims were ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, and ought to have been complied with, and for the&s;e rea&s;ons gave him whole&s;ome coun&s;el, which a wi&s;e prince would have received with thankfulne&s;s, and re|warded with honor. But this childi&s;h Prince was fonder of the gewgaws of maje&s;ty and &s;tate, than the dignity of real government; and cho&s;e rather to imitate the <HI>&s;ins</HI> and <HI>follies</HI> of his Father's reign, than covet his wi&s;dom, wherein he was worthy of imitation.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more fooli&s;h and weak, than to violate the fundamental laws of government. It was a fundamental law of the land, that the king &s;hould not have his heart lifted up above his brethren; for if this &s;hould happen, he nor his children were to prolong their days in the kingdom. Yet this he regarded no|thing, but for the &s;ake of unju&s;t dominion, lo&s;t the ten parts out of twelve of his whole dominions.</P>
<P>Thirdly, It was childi&s;h, to turn away men of age and experience, and to chu&s;e young coun&s;ellors who knew but little, and were on that account more ready to be ra&s;h and head&s;trong. He however ad|vi&s;ed with the young men that had grown up with him&s;elf, who gave him coun&s;el according to his own inclination. Perhaps &s;ome of them had been his <HI>tutors,</HI> and had taught him tho&s;e principles of go|vernment, which they wi&s;hed to &s;ee put in practice now when he was come to the throne. Their prin|ciples are manife&s;t from the advice which they gave
<PB N="27" REF="28">their &s;overeign. <HI>And they &s;aid unto him, thus &s;halt thou &s;peak unto this people that &s;peak unto thee &s;aying, thy Father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us: thus &s;halt thou &s;ay unto them, my little finger &s;hall be heavier than my Father's loins, and now whereas my Father did lade you with a beavy yoke, I will add is your yoke, my Father did cha&s;tize you with whips, but I will cha&s;tize you with &s;corpions,</HI> This &s;peech, like many other &s;peeches that are made for king's, this childi&s;h Prince was &s;o fooli&s;h as to deliver to the people, which made them change their petition into a remon&s;trance, which he did not &s;oon forget. <HI>The people an&s;wered the King and &s;aid, what portion have we in David? Neither have we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ritance in the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e: to your tents, O I&s;|rael! n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w &s;ee to thine own hou&s;e David.</HI> It is the greate&s;t folly in the world for kings to drive their &s;ubjects to de&s;pair; there is none can tell what a peo|ple with do when once they are awakened. All fami|lies are alike to them when their own natural rights and privileges are come in competition.</P>
<P>Whatever rea&s;ons Rehoboam might give for pre|ferring the&s;e ra&s;h coun&s;ellors in&s;tead of the old &s;ages who gave &s;alutary advice, they certainly had their foundation in weakne&s;s and childi&s;hne&s;s. He might probably alledge that he had a right to chu&s;e his own &s;ervants and prefer his particular friends; this is a common argument with &s;overeigns when they are challenged on this head. But they ought to con&s;ider, that the government of a nation is very different from the government of a hou&s;hold, or the manage|ment of dome&s;tic affairs. Though a king has a right to chu&s;e his own &s;ervants, yet tho&s;e &s;ervants have no right to ruin a whole nation to plea&s;e one man. A prince may appoint whom he plea&s;es to manage the affairs of his own hou&s;e, without con|&s;ulting the nation concerning his conduct; but what relates to the public is quite different; the &s;overeign and all his &s;ervants are accountable to the community
<PB N="28" REF="29">for the management of public affairs; for there can be no authority with uncontrollable power to ruin mankind, lodged in any department of &s;ociety.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY AND ORIGIN OF REPUBLICS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From</HI> The P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Letters. <HI>By Lord Lyttleton.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ONE of the thing which mu&s;t exerci&s;ed my cu|rio&s;ity after my arrival in Europe, was the Hi&s;tory and Origin of Republics. Thou knowe&s;t that generally the <HI>As;iatics</HI> have not &s;o much as the lea&s;t idea of this &s;ort of government, and that their imagination never extended &s;o far as to comprehend, there could po&s;&s;ibly be any other &s;ort than the de&s;|potic throughout the world.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t governments were monarchical: it was only by chance, and length of time, that republics were formed.</P>
<P><HI>Greece</HI> having been &s;wallowed up by a deluge, new inhabitants came to people it: &s;he had almo&s;t all her Colonies from Egypt, and the neare&s;t <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> countries: and tho&s;e countries being governed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ngs the people that came out of them were governed in the like mannerr But the tyranny of tho&s;e princes growing too heavy, the people &s;hook o&s;l the yoke, and from the broken remains of &s;o many kingdoms aro&s;e tho&s;e republics which made <HI>Greece</HI> &s;o very flouri&s;hing, the only polite country amid&s;t Barba|rians.</P>
<P>The love of liberty, and aver&s;ion to kings, pre|&s;erved <HI>Greece</HI> a long time in a &s;tate of independence, and very far extended the republican government. The cities of Greece found allies in <HI>A&s;ia Minor;</HI> they &s;ent thither colonies as free as them&s;elves, which were &s;o many ramparts again&s;t the attempts of the kings of <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">.</HI> This was not all: <HI>Greece</HI> peopled <HI>Italy; Italy, Spain,</HI> and perhaps <HI>Gaul.</HI> It is noto|rious that the great <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">peria,</HI> &s;o famous among the antients, was at the beginning <HI>Greece,</HI> which was looked upon by its neighbours as the &s;eat of felicity: the <HI>Greeks</HI> not finding at home that happy country,
<PB N="37" REF="38">went and looked for it in <HI>Italy:</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>Italy,</HI> in <HI>Spain;</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>Spain</HI> in <HI>Boetica</HI> or <HI>Portugal:</HI> &s;o that all the&s;e regions went by this name among the ancients. The&s;e <HI>Greek</HI> Colonies carried along with them a &s;pirit of liberty, which they had a&s;&s;umed from that kindly climate. And accordingly we &s;eldom or never, in tho&s;e remote times, meet with monarchies in <HI>Italy, Spain,</HI> or either of the <HI>Gauls.</HI> We &s;hall &s;ee by and by, that the people of the <HI>North</HI> and of <HI>Germany,</HI> were no le&s;s free than the others; and if there are appearances of any thing like royalty among them, it is becau&s;e their leaders of armies, or heads of republics, were mi&s;|taken for kings.</P>
<P>All this happened in <HI>Europe:</HI> as for <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> they were ever oppre&s;&s;ed with de&s;poti&s;m: excepting &s;ome towns of <HI>A&s;ia Minor</HI> already taken notice of; and the republic of Carthage in Africa.</P>
<P>The world was divided between two powerful republics, <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Carthage:</HI> nothing is &s;o well known as the beginning of the Roman republic, and nothing &s;o little known as the origin of that of <HI>Carthage:</HI> we are utterly ignorant of the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of the <HI>African</HI> Princes, after <HI>Dido,</HI> nor do we know by what means they came to lo&s;e their pow|er. The prodigious increa&s;e of the <HI>Roman</HI> repub|lic would have been a great ble&s;&s;ing to mankind, had there not been that unrea&s;onable difference between the citizens of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the conquered nations; had they given to the governors of pro|vinces, a more limited authority; had they paid due regard to tho&s;e divine laws, made to re&s;train their tyranny; and had they not, in order to &s;i|lence tho&s;e laws, employed the very trea&s;ures which their rapine and inju&s;tice, had accumulated together.</P>
<P>Liberty &s;eems to be calculated to the genius of the nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;lavery adapted to tha of the <HI>A&s;iatics.</HI> In vain did the <HI>Romans</HI> offer tht
<PB N="38" REF="39">invaluable trea&s;ure to the <HI>Cappadocians;</HI> that worth|le&s;s nation refu&s;ed it, and courted &s;ervitude with the &s;ame ardour as other nations pur&s;ued liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ar</HI> cru&s;hed the <HI>Roman</HI> republic, and brought it under arbitrary power.</P>
<P><HI>Europe</HI> groaned a long time beneath the military and violent government; and the <HI>Roman</HI> mildne&s;s was changed into a hard-hearted oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mean while, infinite numbers of unknown na|tions, &s;warmed from out the <HI>North:</HI> &s;pread them|&s;elves like torrents through all the <HI>Roman</HI> provin|ces; and finding it as ea&s;y a thing to make conque&s;ts, as to increa&s;e their piracies, they di&s;membered tho&s;e provinces, and made kingdoms of them. The&s;e people were free; and they &s;o confined the authority of their kings, that they were properly &s;peaking no more than chieftains, or generals. Thus, tho&s;e kingdoms, though founded in force, felt not the yoke of a conqueror. When the na|tions of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> namely the <HI>Turks</HI> and the <HI>Tartars,</HI> made any conque&s;ts, they being accu&s;tomed to the will and plea&s;ure of one &s;ingle per&s;on, thought of nothing more than bringing him new &s;ubjects, and by the force of arms e&s;tabli&s;h his violent authority; but the <HI>Nothern</HI> nations being free in their own country, when they had &s;eized the <HI>Roman</HI> pro|vinces, took care not to be&s;tow on their chief, too large a power. Nay &s;ome of them, the <HI>Vandals,</HI> for in&s;tance, in <HI>Africa.</HI> the Goths in Spain, depo&s;|ed their kings whenever they were di&s;&s;atisfied with them: and the others too abridged the authority of the prince a thou&s;and ways: a great number of lords took &s;hare of it with him; a war was never entered into without their con&s;ent; the plunder was divided between the general and the &s;oldiers; no taxation in favour of the prince; the laws were made in a&s;&s;emblies of the whole nation, &s;uch was the fundamental principle of all tho&s;e &s;tates that were formed out of the wrecks of the <HI>Roman</HI> em|pire.</P>

<P>And it is a mi&s;take to think, that the mo&s;t hard|ened &s;inner, who oweth his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or titles to any &s;uch wicked arts of thieving, can have true peace of mind, under the reproaches of a guilty con&s;cience, and amid&s;t the cries of ruined widows and orphans.</P>
<P>I know not one real advantage that the rich have over the poor, except the power of doing good to others: But this is an advantage which God hath not given wicked men the grace to make u&s;e of. The wealth acquired by evil means, was ne|ver employed to good ends: for that would be to divide the kingdom of <HI>Satan</HI> again&s;t it&s;elf. What|ever hath been gained by fraud, avarice, oppre&s;|&s;ion, and the like, mu&s;t be pre&s;erved and increa&s;ed by the &s;ame methods.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add but one thing more upon this head which I hope will convince you, that God (who&s;e thoughts are not as our thoughts) never intended riches or power to be nece&s;&s;ary for the happine&s;s of mankind in this life; becau&s;e it is certain, that there is not one &s;ingle good quality of the mind ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to obtain them, where men are re&s;olved to be rich at any rate; neither honour, ju&s;tice, temperance, wi&s;dom, religion, truth, or learning: for a &s;light acquaintance of the world will inform us, that there have been many in&s;tan|ces of men in all ages, who have arrived at great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and great dignities, by cunning, fraud or flattery, without any of the&s;e, or any other vir|rues that can be named. Now if riches and great|ne&s;s were &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings, that good men without
<PB N="46" REF="47">them could have their &s;hare of happine&s;s in this life; how cometh it to pa&s;s, that God &s;hould &s;uf|fer them to be often dealt to the wor&s;t and mo&s;t profligate of mankind? that they &s;hould be gene|rally procured by the mo&s;t abominable means, and applied to the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t wicked u&s;es? This ought not to be conceived of a ju&s;t, a merci&s;ul, a wi&s;e, and almighty being. We mu&s;t therefore con|clude that wealth and power are in their own nature, at be&s;t, but things indifferent, and that a good man may be equally happy without them, provided that he hath a &s;ufficiency of the common ble&s;&s;ings of human life, to an&s;wer all the rea&s;onable and virtuous demands of nature, which his indu&s;|try will provide, and &s;obriety will prevent his wanting. Agur's prayer, with the rea&s;ons of his wi&s;h, are full to this purpo&s;e. <Q>Give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with food conveni|ent for me; le&s;t I be full and deny thee, and &s;ay who is the Lord?

<HEAD>ON SACRILEGE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From Cato's Letters.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SACRILEGE we are told by &s;ome, &s;ignifies the robbing or &s;tealing from God any thing which is peculiarly his. Now nothing can be &s;tolen from God, nor can any thing be conceal|ed from him. Every thing being his, it is as much his in the hands of one man as in the hands of ano|ther; for, let who will have the u&s;e of it, the pro|perty cannot be altered: God who has all things, can never be put out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any thing, and as nothing can be taken from him, &s;o neither can anything be given to him, becau&s;e all the world and every thing in it is aheady his: and it is ab|&s;urd
<PB N="47" REF="48">to imagine that any form of words, or change of place or po&s;ition, can enlarge or le&s;&s;en his pro|perty in any thing. All that we have, we have from him: and to return him his own gifts back again, which we want and he does not, is no com|pliment, nor any part of religion or rea&s;on: It is &s;hewing our&s;elves wi&s;er than he, in &s;etting apart for his u&s;e tho&s;e things which he has graciou&s;ly created and &s;et apart for ours. Can we feed him? or can we cloath, adorn or enrich him? Can we build him a city to dwell in, or furni&s;h him with guards for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on?</P>
<P>Sacrilege therefore is either the robbing of men, or no robbery at all. And this crime is greater or le&s;s, according to the mea&s;ure or mi&s;chief done. To rob a poor man of his loaf, is a greater crime, in <HI>foro con&s;cientiae,</HI> than to rob a rich man of an Ox: To rob a man of a &s;mall part of a thing that is nece&s;&s;ary to him, is a greater crime, than the rob|bing him of a great &s;uperfluity; and if I rob a man of a thing that will do him hurt, I hope I do him le&s;s an injury, than if I robbed him of a thing which does him good. But if I take a thing which no man has a right to, I my&s;elf have a right to it, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it.</P>
<P>To apply all this to the bu&s;ine&s;s of Sacrilege; if a man take away any of the books, ve&s;tments, or uten&s;ils, made u&s;e of in devotion, he only robs the congregation, who mu&s;t buy more; and many be|ing more able than one to bear the lo&s;s, the offence, as to its effects, is le&s;s than if he robbed but one man. But if he take away from a Heathen Tem|ple, plate, or hidden trea&s;ure, laid up there, but not u&s;ed, he indeed does an action that he has no right to do, but an action that however does good to the world, by turning into u&s;e, that which was of none, or of bad u&s;e.</P>
<P>Dead trea&s;ure, fir&s;t drawn from the people in &s;u|per&s;titious offerings, and then laid up in a Hea|then
<PB N="48" REF="49">Temple, and kept and u&s;ed for impious and idolatrous ends, but never to return again into the world, for the nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es of life and com|merce, is the plunder of mankind; and the wor&s;t of all plunders, becau&s;e it never circulates; and people are greatly the wor&s;e for it, in re&s;pect both of &s;oul and body, but never can be the better, it is fir&s;t taking from them and afterwards denying them the great and chief means of life and convenience. He therefore, whoever he be, that takes it from thence, let him take it in what manner he will, does a better and more public thing, than he who keeps it there.</P>
<P>No man can be robbed of a thing in which he has no property. Of this &s;ort was Apollo's wealth; and nobody was robbed in taking it away. So that whoever takes away golden images, or other dead wealth the means and objects of fal&s;e adoration, is guilty of no other crime, than that of di&s;turbing erroneous con&s;ciences: Nor need &s;uch con&s;ciences be much di&s;turbed, &s;ince the crime being commit|ted without their con&s;ent, they have no &s;hare in it. And therefore if &s;uch idolatrous images, and &s;uch &s;uper&s;titious, u&s;ele&s;s, and pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nic ous riches be taken away by a lawful authority, or in a lawful war. it is no crime at all.

<P>I AM &s;orry I cannot in all things conform my&s;elf to the advices of my friends; if theirs had any joint concernment with mine, I would willingly &s;ubmit my intere&s;t to theirs, but when I alone am intere&s;ted, and they only advi&s;e to come over as &s;oon as the act of indemnity is pa&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e they think it is be&s;t for me, I cannot wholly lay a&s;ide my own judgment and choice. I confe&s;s we are natu|rally inclined to delight in our own country, and I have a particular love to mine; I hope I have given &s;ome te&s;timony of it; I think that being exiled from it is a great evil, and would redeem my&s;elf from it with the lo&s;s of a great deal of my blood: but when that country of mine, which u&s;ed to be e&s;teemed a paradi&s;e, is now like to be made a &s;tage of injury, the liberty which we hoped to e&s;tabli&s;h.

Is it a plea&s;ure to &s;ee all that I love in the world &s;old and de&s;troyed? Shall I renounce all my old principles, learn the vile court arts, and make my peace by bribing &s;ome of them?

I have in my life been guilty of many follies, but as I think of no meanne&s;s, I will not blot and de file that which is pa&s;t, by endeavouring to provide for the future. I have ever had in my mind, that when God &s;hould ca&s;t me into &s;uch a condition, as that I cannot &s;ave my life, but by doing an indecent thing, he &s;hews me the time is come wherein I &s;hould re&s;ign it. And when I can|not live in my own country, but by &s;uch moans as are wor&s;e than dying in it, I think he &s;hews me, I ought to keep my&s;elf out of it. Let them plea&s;e them&s;elves with making the king glorious, who think a <HI>whole</HI> people may ju&s;tly be &s;acrificed for the intere&s;t and plea&s;ure of <HI>one</HI> man and a <HI>few</HI> of his follow|ers: let them rejoice in their &s;ubtility, who by betray|ing the former powers have gained the favour of this, not only pre&s;erved but advanced them&s;elves in the&s;e dangerous changes.

I had for|merly &s;ome jealou&s;ies, the fraudulent proclamation for indemnity encrea&s;ed the impri&s;oning of tho&s;e three men, and turning out of all the officers of the army, contrary to promi&s;e, confirmed me in my re|&s;olutions not to return.</P>
<P>To conclude, the tide is not to be diverted, nor the oppre&s;&s;ed delivered; but God in his time, will have mercy on his People; he will &s;ave and defend them, and avenge the blood of tho&s;e who &s;hall now peri&s;h, upon the heads of tho&s;e, who in their pride, think nothing is able to oppo&s;e them.

<P>[From CATO'S Letters.]</P>
<P>CAESAR had u&s;urped the <HI>Roman</HI> world, and was cantoning it out to his creatures as be|came a tyrant, and paying his per&s;onal favourites with the public bounty. As the wor&s;t tyrants mu&s;t have &s;ome friend; and as the be&s;t men do them the mo&s;t credit, and bring them the mo&s;t &s;up|port<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> if &s;uch can be got: <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> had &s;en&s;e enough to know, that he could never buy <HI>Brutus</HI> too dear, and &s;o paid him great court. But <HI>Brutus</HI> &s;aw the tyrant's de&s;ign, and his own &s;hame; and every ci|vility was a fre&s;h provocation. It was as if a thief
<PB N="55" REF="56">breaking into a hou&s;e to rob a lady of her jewels, &s;poke thus to her &s;on: <HI>Sir, pray permit me, or a&s;&s;ist me to cut your mother's throat, and &s;eize her trea&s;ure and I will generou&s;ly reward you with your life, and lend you one or two of her diamonds to &s;parkle in as long as I think fit.</HI> Could &s;uch a villainous civility as this engage the &s;on, e&s;pecially a virtuous &s;on, to any thing but revenge? And would not the only way that he could take it, be the be&s;t way?</P>
<P><HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> took from <HI>Brutus</HI> his liberty, and his legal title to his life and his e&s;tate, and gave him in lieu of it a precarious one during his own arbitrary will and plea&s;ure. Upon the &s;ame terms he gave him &s;ome mercenary employments, as hire for that great man's a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;upport his tyranny. Could the great and free &s;oul of <HI>Brutus</HI> brook this? Could <HI>Brutus</HI> be the in&s;trument or confederate of lawle&s;s ju&s;t? <HI>Brutus</HI> receive wages from an oppre&s;&s;or! That great, virtuous, and popular <HI>Brutus:</HI> who, if the common wealth had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, might from his repu|tation, birth, abilities, and his excellent worth, have challenged the mo&s;t honourable and advan|tageous offices in it, without owing thanks to <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>So that the injuries done by <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> to <HI>Brutus</HI> were great, heinous, and many: and the favours none. All the mercy &s;hewn by <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was art and affecta|tion, and pure &s;elf-love. He had found in the <HI>Roman</HI> people &s;o univer&s;al a dete&s;tation of the bloody mea&s;ures of <HI>Marius, Cinna,</HI> and <HI>Sylla.</HI> He &s;aw the whole empire &s;o reduced and enervated by repeated pro&s;criptions and ma&s;&s;acres, that he thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t his intere&s;t to e&s;tabli&s;h his new-erected domi|nion by different mea&s;ures; and to reconcile. by a fal&s;e and hypocritical &s;hew of clemency, the minds of men, yet bleeding with the late and former wounds, to his u&s;urpation, that <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> the u&s;urp|ing and de&s;tructive <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> who had &s;laughtered millions. and wantonly made havock of human race, had any other &s;ort of mercy, than the mercy
<PB N="56" REF="57">of policy and deceit, will not be pretended by any man, that knows his and the <HI>Roman</HI> &s;tory.</P>
<P><HI>Brutus</HI> therefore being the mo&s;t reverenced and popular man in <HI>Rome,</HI> it became the cra&s;t of the tyrant to make <HI>Brutus</HI> his friend; it was adding a &s;ort of &s;anctity to a wicked cau&s;e. Whereas the death of <HI>Brutus</HI> by <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> would have made <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> odious and dreadful even among&s;t his own follow|ers.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, that <HI>Brutus</HI> &s;ubmitted to <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and was bound by his own act. Here the allegation is true, but the con&s;equence fal&s;e. Did not <HI>Brutus</HI> &s;ubmit to <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> as innocent men are often forced to &s;ubmit to the gallies, the wheel, and the gibbet? He &s;ubmitted as a man robbed and bound, &s;ubmits to a hou&s;e-breaker, who with a pi&s;tol at his heart, forces from him a di&s;covery of his trea|&s;ure, and a promi&s;e not to pro&s;ecute him. Such engagements are not only void in them&s;elves, but aggravate the injuries, by the law of nature and rea|&s;on, as well as by the po&s;itive in&s;titutions of every country, all promi&s;es, bonds, or oaths, extorted by dure&s;s, that is, by unlawful impri&s;onments or menaces, are not obligatory. It is, on the contrary, a crime to fulfil them; becau&s;e an acquie&s;cence in the impo&s;itions of lawle&s;s villains, is abetting law|le&s;s villains.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides it was not in the power of <HI>Brutus</HI> to alter his allegiance, which he had already engaged to the Commonwealth, which had done nothing to forfeit the &s;ame. For how lawful &s;oever it be for &s;ubjects to transfer their obedience to a con|queror in foreign war, when the former civil pow|er can no longer protect them; or to a new magi&s;|trate made by con&s;ent, when the old had forfeited or re&s;igned: It is ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e, that they can transfer it to a dome&s;tic traitor and robbet; who is under the &s;ame ties and allegiance with them&s;elves, and by all acts of violence, trea&s;on,
<PB N="57" REF="58">and u&s;urpation, extorts a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from his op|pre&s;&s;ed ma&s;ters and fellow &s;ubjects.

To own that no per&s;onal con&s;iderations, not even the highe&s;t upon earth, could reconcile him to a tyrant; and that he preferred the liberty of the world to the empire of the world!</P>
<P>The above charges therefore again&s;t <HI>Brutus,</HI> can hardly come from any but tho&s;e, who, like the profane and &s;lavi&s;h <HI>E&s;au,</HI> would &s;ell their birth|right for a me&s;s of pottage, would &s;acrifice their duty to their intere&s;t; and, unconcerned what be|comes of the re&s;t of mankind, would promote ty|ranny, if they might but &s;hine in its trappings.

</EPIGRAPH>
<HEAD>A memorable Letter from Brutus to Cicero.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE &s;een by the favour of <HI>Atticus,</HI> that part which concerns me, in your letter to <HI>Octavius.</HI> The affection which you there expre&s;s for my per|&s;on, and the pains which you take for my &s;afety, are great; but they give me no new joy. Your kind offices are become as habitual for me to re|ceive, as for you to be&s;tow; and by your daily di&s;|cour&s;e and actions in my behalf, I have daily in|&s;tances of your generous regard for my&s;elf and my reputation.</P>
<P>However, all this hinders not but that the above|mentioned article of your letters to <HI>Octavius,</HI> pierc|ed me with as &s;en&s;ible a grief as my &s;oul is capable of feeling. In thanking him for his &s;ervices to the republic, you have cho&s;en a &s;tile which &s;hews &s;uch lowne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, as do but too clearly de|clare that you have &s;till a ma&s;ter; and that the old tyranny, which we thought de&s;troyed, is revived in a new tyrant. What &s;hall I &s;ay to you upon this &s;ad head? I am covered with confu&s;ion for your &s;hameful condition, but you have brought it upon your&s;elf; and I cannot help &s;hewing you to your&s;elf in this wretched circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>You have petitioned <HI>Octavius</HI> to have mercy upon me, and to &s;ave my life&mdash;In this you intend my good, but &s;ought my mi&s;ery, and a lot wor&s;e than death, by &s;aving me from it; &s;ince there is no kind of death but is more eligible to me, than a life &s;o &s;a|ved. Be &s;o good to recollect a little the terms of your letter; and having weighed them as you ought, can you deny that they are conceived in the low &s;tile of an humble petition from a &s;lave to his haugh|ty lord, from a &s;ubject to a king? You tell <HI>Octavius</HI> that you have a reque&s;t to make him, and hope that he will plea&s;e to grant it; namely to &s;ave tho&s;e
<PB N="59" REF="60">citizens who are e&s;teemed by men of condition, and beloved by the people of Rome. This is your honourable reque&s;t; but what if he &s;hould not grant it, but refu&s;e to &s;ave us? Can we be &s;aved by no other expedient; Certainly, de&s;truction it|&s;elf is preferable to life by his favour.</P>
<P>I am not, however, &s;o de&s;ponding, as to imagine that heaven is &s;o offended with the <HI>Roman</HI> people, or &s;o bent upon their ruin, that you &s;hould thus chu&s;e in your prayers; to apply rather to <HI>Octavius,</HI> than to the immortal Gods, for the pre&s;ervation, I do not &s;ay of the deliverers of the whole earth, but even for the pre&s;ervation of the meane&s;t <HI>Roman</HI> citizen. This is a high tone to talk in, but I have plea&s;ure in it: It becomes me to &s;hew that <HI>I &s;corn to pray to tho&s;e whom I &s;corn to fear.</HI></P>
<P>Has then <HI>Octavius</HI> power to &s;ave us? and while you thus own him to be a tyrant, can you yet own your&s;elf his friend? And while you are mine, can you de&s;ire to &s;ee me in <HI>Rome</HI> and at the mercy of an u&s;urper? And yet that this would be my ca&s;e, you avow by imploring from a giddy boy, my permi&s;&s;ion to return, you have been rendering him a world of thanks, and making him many compli|ments; pray how came they to be due to him, if he yet want to be petitioned for our lives, and if our liberties depend upon his &s;ufferance? Are we bound to think it a conde&s;cen&s;ion in <HI>Octavius,</HI> that he chu&s;es that the&s;e our petitions &s;hould rather be made to him than to <HI>Anthony?</HI> And are not &s;uch low &s;upplications the proper addre&s;&s;es to a tyrant? And yet &s;hall we, who boldly de&s;troyed one, be ever brought ba&s;ely to &s;upplicate another? And can we who are the deliverers of the Common|wealth, de&s;cend to a&s;k what no man ought to have it in his power to give?</P>
<P>Con&s;ider the mournful effects of that dread and de&s;pondency of yours, in our public &s;truggle, in which, however, you have too many to keep you
<PB N="60" REF="61">in countenance. <HI>The Commonwealth has been los<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, becau&s;e it was given for lo&s;t.</HI> Hence Cae&s;ar was fir&s;t in&s;pired with the lu&s;t of dominion; hence <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI> not terrified by the doom of the tyrant, pants and hurries on to &s;ucceed him in his tyranny: and hence this <HI>Octavius,</HI> this green u&s;urper, is &s;tart|ed into &s;uch a pitch of power, that the chiefs of the commonwealth, and the &s;aviours of their country, mu&s;t depend for their breath upon his plea&s;ure. Yes, we mu&s;t owe our lives to the mercy of a mi|nor, &s;oftened by the prayers of aged &s;enators.</P>
<P>Alas, we are no longer <HI>Romans!</HI> If we were, the virtuous &s;pirit of liberty would have been an ealy over-match for the traiterous attempts of the wor&s;t of all men gra&s;ping after tyranny; nor would even <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI> the ra&s;h and enterpri&s;ing <HI>Mark Antho|ny,</HI> have been &s;o fond of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s power, as frighten|ed by <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s &s;ate.</P>
<P>Remember the important character which you &s;u&s;tain. the great po&s;t which you have filled. You me a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">or of <HI>Rome,</HI> you have been con&s;ul of <HI>Rome;</HI> you have defeated con&s;piraces, you have de&s;troved con&s;pirators. Is not <HI>Rome</HI> &s;till as dear to you as &s;he was? Or&punc; is your courage and vigilance le&s;s? And is not the occa&s;ion greater? Or, could you &s;uppre&s;s great traitors, and yet tolerate great|er? Recollect what you ought to do, by what you have done. Whence proceeded your enmity to <HI>Anthony?</HI> Was it not that he had an enmity to li|berty, had &s;eized violently on the public, a&s;&s;umed the di&s;po&s;al of life and death into his own hands, and &s;et up for the &s;ole &s;overeign of all men? Were not the&s;e the rea&s;ons of your enmity and of your advice to combat violence by violence, to kill him rather than &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t to him? All this was well, but why mu&s;t re&s;i&s;tance be dropped, when there is a fre&s;h call for re&s;i&s;tance? Has your courage &s;ailed you; or, was it not permitted to <HI>Anthony</HI> to en|&s;lave us, but another may? As if the nature of &s;er|vitude
<PB N="61" REF="62">were changed by changing names and per&s;ons. No, we do not di&s;pute about the qualifications of a ma&s;ter; we will have <HI>no</HI> ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>It is certain, that we might, under <HI>Anthony,</HI> have had large &s;hares with him in the admini&s;tra|tion of de&s;potic power; we might have divided its dignities, and &s;hone in its trappings. He would have received us graciou&s;ly, and met us half way.</P>
<P>He knew that either our concurrence or acquie&s;|cence would have confirmed him monarch of <HI>Rome;</HI> and at what price would he not have purcha&s;ed either? But all his arts, all his temptations, all his offers were rejected, liberty was our purpo&s;e, vir|tue our rule: Our views were hone&s;t and univer+&s;al; our country and the cau&s;e of mankind.</P>
<P>With <HI>Octavius</HI> him&s;elf there is &s;till a way open for an accommodation, if we cho&s;e it. As eager as the name of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> has made that raw &s;tickler for empire, to de&s;troy tho&s;e who de&s;troyed <HI>Cae&s;ar;</HI> yet, doubtle&s;s, he would give us good articles, to gain our con&s;ent to that power to which he a&s;pires, and to which I fear, he will atrive; alas! what is there to hinder him? While we only attend to the love of life, and the impul&s;es of ambition, while we can purcha&s;e po&s;ts and dignities with the price of liberty, and think danger more dreadful than &s;lavery; what remains to &s;ave us?</P>
<P>What was the end of our killing the tyrant, but to be free from tyranny?&mdash;A ridiculous motive, and an empty exploit, if our &s;lavery &s;urvive him! Oh, who is it that makes liberty his care? Liberty, which ought to be the care of all men, as it is the benefit and ble&s;&s;ing of all! For my&s;elf rather than give it up, I will &s;tand &s;ingle in its defence, I can|not lo&s;e, but with my life, my re&s;olution to main|tain in freedom my country which I have &s;et free: I have de&s;troyed a veteran tyrant; and &s;hall I &s;uf|fer in a raw youth, his heir, a power to controul the &s;enate, &s;uper&s;ede the laws, and put chains
<PB N="62" REF="63">on <HI>Rome?</HI> A power which no per&s;onal favours nor even the ties of blood could ever &s;anctify to me; a power, which I could not bear in <HI>Cae&s;ar;</HI> nor if my father had u&s;urped it, could I have borne him.</P>
<P>Your petition to <HI>Octavius</HI> is a confe&s;&s;ion that we cannot enjoy the liberty of Rome without his leave; and can you dream that other citizens are free, where we could not live free? Be&s;ides, having made your reque&s;t, how is it to be fulfilled? You beg him to give us our lives; and what if he do? Are we therefore &s;afe becau&s;e we live? Is there any &s;afety without liberty; or rather, can we poor|ly live having lo&s;t it, and with it our honour and glory? is there any &s;ecurity in living at <HI>Rome</HI> when <HI>Rome</HI> is no longer free? That city, great as it is having no &s;ecurity of her own, can give me none&mdash;No, I will owe mine to my re&s;olution and my &s;word; I cannot enjoy life at the mercy of another; <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s death alone a&s;certained my liberty to me, which before was precarious: I &s;mote him to be &s;afe. This is a Ro|man &s;pirit, and whither&s;oever I carry it, every place will be <HI>Rome</HI> to me, who am <HI>Roman</HI> enough to prefer every evil to chains and infamy, which to a Roman are the highe&s;t of all evils. I thought that we had been relea&s;ed from the&s;e mighty evils, by the death of him who brought them upon us; but it &s;eems that we are not; el&s;e why a &s;ervile petition to a youth, big with the name and the am|bition of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> for mercy to tho&s;e patriots, who generou&s;ly revenged their country upon that ty|rant, and cleared the world of his tyranny? It was not thus in the Commonwealths of <HI>Greece</HI> where the children of tyrants &s;uffered equally with their fathers, the puni&s;hment of tyranny.</P>
<P>Can I then have any appetite to &s;ee <HI>Rome</HI> or, can <HI>Rome</HI> be &s;aid to be <HI>Rome?</HI> We have &s;lain our tyrant, we have re&s;tored our ancient liberty: But
<PB N="63" REF="64">they are favours thrown away; &s;he is made free in &s;pite of her&s;elf; and though &s;he has &s;een a great and terrible tyrant bereft of his grandeur and his life, by a few of her citizens; yet ba&s;ely de&s;pond|ing of her own &s;trength, &s;he impotently dreads the name of a dead tyrant, revived in the per&s;on of a &s;tripling.</P>
<P>No more of your petitions to your young <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> on my behalf; nor, if you are wi&s;e, on your own. You have not many years to live; do not be &s;hew|ing that you over-rate the &s;hort remains of an ho|nourable life, by making prepo&s;terous and di&s;ho|nourable court to a boy. Take care that by this conduct you do not eclip&s;e the lu&s;tre of all your glorious actions again&s;t <HI>Mark Anthony:</HI> Do not turn your glory into reproach, by giving the ma|licious a handle to &s;ay, that &s;elf-love was the &s;ole motive of your bitterne&s;s to him; and that, had you not dreaded him, you would not have oppo&s;ed him: And yet will they not &s;ay this, if they &s;ee that having declared war again&s;t <HI>Anthony,</HI> you notwith&s;tanding have life and liberty at the mercy of <HI>Octavius,</HI> and tolerate in him all the power which the other claimed? They will &s;ay that you are not again&s;t having a ma&s;ter, only you would not have Anthony for a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I will approve of your prai&s;es given to <HI>Octavius</HI> for his behaviour thus far; it is indeed prai&s;e wor|thy; provided his only intention has been to pull down the tyranny of <HI>Anthony,</HI> without e&s;tabli&s;hing a tyranny of his own. But if you are of opinion that <HI>Octavius</HI> is in &s;uch a &s;ituation of power, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to approach him with humble &s;up|plications to &s;ave our lives and that it is conveni|ent he &s;hould be tru&s;ted with this power; I can only &s;ay, that you lift the reward of his merits, far above his merits: I thought that all his &s;ervices were &s;ervices done to the republic, but you have conferred upon him that ab&s;olute and imperial pow|er which he pretended to recover to the republic.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65">If, in your judgment, <HI>Octavius</HI> has earned &s;uch laurels and recompences for making war again <HI>An|thony</HI>'s tyranny, which was only the effects and remains of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s tyranny; to what di&s;tinctions, to what rewards would you entitle tho&s;e who ex|terminated, with <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> the tyranny of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> for which they felt the ble&s;&s;ings and bounty of the <HI>Roman</HI> people? Has this never entered into your thoughts? Behold here, how effectually the terror of evils to come, extingui&s;hes in the minds all impre&s;&s;ions of benefits received! <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> is dead, and will never return to &s;hackle or frighten the City of <HI>Rome;</HI> &s;o he is no more thought of, nor are they who delivered that City from him. But <HI>Anthony</HI> is &s;till alive, and &s;till in arms, and &s;till terrifies; and &s;o <HI>Octavius</HI> is adored, who beat <HI>Anthony.</HI> Hence it is that <HI>Octavius</HI> is become of &s;uch potent con&s;equence, that from his mouth the <HI>Roman</HI> people mu&s;t expect our doom, the doom of their deliverers! And hence it is too that we (tho&s;e deliverers) are of &s;uch humble con&s;equence, that he mu&s;t be &s;up|plicated to give us our lives!</P>
<P>I, as &s;aid, have a &s;oul, and I have a &s;word; and am an enemy to &s;uch abject &s;upplications; &s;o great an enemy, that I dete&s;t tho&s;e that u&s;e them, and am an avowed foe to him that expects them. I &s;hall at lea&s;t be far away from the odious company of &s;laves; and wherever I find liberty, there I will find <HI>Rome.</HI> And for you that &s;tay behind, who not &s;atiated with many years, and many honours, can behold liberty extinct, and virtue with us, in exile, and yet are not &s;ick of a wretched and precarious life; I heartily pity you. For my&s;elf, who&s;e &s;oul has never ebbed from its con&s;tant prin|ciples, I &s;hall ever be happy in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my virtue; owing nothing to my country, to|wards which I have faithfully di&s;charged my duty, I &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s my mind in peace, and find the re|ward of well-doing in the &s;atisfaction of having
<PB N="65" REF="66">done it. What greater plea&s;ure does the world afford, than to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;lippery uncertainties of life, and to value that only which is valua|ble, private virtue, and public liberty; that li|berty which is the ble&s;&s;ing, and ought to be the birth-right of all mankind?</P>
<P>But &s;till, I will never &s;ink with tho&s;e who are already falling; I will never yield with tho&s;e who have a mind to &s;ubmit: I am re&s;olved to be always firm and independent; I will try all expedients; I will exert my utmo&s;t prowe&s;s, to bani&s;h &s;ervitude and &s;et my country entirely free. If fortune fa|vours me as &s;he ought, the ble&s;&s;ing and joy will be every man's; but if &s;he fail me, and my be&s;t endea|vours be thrown away, yet &s;till I will rejoice &s;ingle; and &s;o far be too hard for fortune. What, in &s;hort, can my life be better laid out in, than in continual &s;chemes, and repeated efforts, for the common liberty of my country?</P>
<P>As to your part in this cri&s;is, my dear <HI>Cicero,</HI> it is my &s;tronge&s;t advice and reque&s;t to you, not to de&s;ert your&s;elf; do not di&s;tru&s;t your ability, and your ability will not di&s;appoint you; believe you can remedy our heavy evils, and you will remedy them. Our mi&s;eries want no increa&s;e; prevent, there|fore, by your vigilance, any new acce&s;&s;ion. Formerly in quality of con&s;ul, you defeated, with great bold|ne&s;s and warmth for liberty, a formidable con&s;pira|cy again&s;t <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;aved the commonwealth; and what you did then again&s;t <HI>Cataline,</HI> you do &s;till again&s;t <HI>Anthony.</HI> The&s;e actions of yours have rai&s;ed your reputation high, and &s;pread it far; but it will be all tarni&s;hed or lo&s;t, if you do not continue to &s;hew an equal firmne&s;s upon as great an occa&s;ion; let this render all the parts of your life equal, and &s;ecure immortality to that glory of yours, which ought to be immortal.</P>
<P>From tho&s;e, who, like you, have performed great actions, as great or greater are expected;
<PB N="66" REF="67">by &s;hewing that they can &s;erve the public, they make them&s;elves its debtors; and it is apt to exact &s;trict payment, and to u&s;e them &s;everely, if they do not pay. But from tho&s;e who have performed no &s;uch actions, we expect none. This is the di|fference betwixt the lot of unknown talents, and of tho&s;e which have been tried; and the condition of the latter is no doubt the harder. Hence it is, that though in making head again&s;t <HI>Anthony,</HI> you have merited and received great and ju&s;t prai&s;es, yet you have gained no new admiration: By &s;o doing you only continued, like a worthy con&s;ular, the known character of a great and able con&s;ul. But if now at la&s;t you begin to truckle to one as bad as he; if you abate ever &s;o little in that vigour of mind, and that &s;teady courage, by which you expelled him from the &s;enate, and drove him out of <HI>Rome;</HI> you will never reap another harve&s;t of glory, whatever you may de&s;erve; and even your pa&s;t laurels will wither, and your pa&s;t renown be forgot.</P>
<P>There is nothing great or noble in events, which are the fruit of pa&s;&s;ion or chance. True fame refults only from the &s;teady per&s;everance of rea&s;on in the paths and pur&s;uits of virtue. The care, therefore, of the commonwealth, and the defence of her liberties, belong to you above all men, becau&s;e you have done more than all men for liberty, and the commonwealth. Your great abi|lities, your known zeal, your famous actions, with the united call and expectation of all men, are your motives in this great affair; would you have greater?</P>
<P>You are not therefore to &s;upplicate <HI>Octavius</HI> for our &s;afety; do a braver thing, owe it to your own magnanimity. Rou&s;e the <HI>Roman</HI> genius within you; and con&s;ider that this great and free city, which you more than once &s;aved, will always be great and fice, provided her people do not want worthy chiefs to re&s;i&s;t u&s;urpation, and exterminate traitors.</P>

<HEAD>THE MARINE REPUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>A Certain man having many &s;ons all bred to a &s;eafaring life, was de&s;irous that they &s;hould live together in a ju&s;t, brotherly, and &s;ocial man|ner; and that though he wi&s;hed to encourage in|dividual indu&s;try, and improvement in abilities, by providing that every one &s;hould reap the fruits of the &s;ame, yet was he determined to form their plan of union in &s;uch a manner that none, not even their children, &s;hould be &s;o depre&s;&s;ed as to be excluded from the common benefits of their birth-right and of an equal token of the impartial regard of their common parent. Wherefore one day having called his &s;ons together, he addre&s;&s;ed them to this effect. <Q>My dear boys, my beha|viour and conduct towards you, has always been &s;uch as to convince you, I was &s;trictly, ju&s;t, and impartial. You were all equally my delight and care in your infancy, you have been equally provided with the means of education, and with every comfort and convenience. I have
<PB N="69" REF="70">&s;hewn no partiality to any, as being older or younger, I have been in all re&s;pects your common parent, and I wi&s;h you and your children to live together as my common children for ever, for I extend my parental regard to your offspring through every generation&mdash;Behold, then, this gallant &s;hip, equipt and provided with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ea, her rigging and tackle all of the be&s;t materials, and admirably adapted to the ocean you have to occupy; amply provid|ed with &s;tores and provi&s;ions for a long voyage, and waiting only for intelligent and &s;kilful agents to conduct her whither&s;oever they will. You my dear boys, are &s;uch agents, &s;ufficiently qualified for the adventurous ta&s;k. <HI>Accept, then my &s;ons of this my precious gift, but remember, I do not give it to one, or two, or a &s;elect few, but to you all, and as many of your po&s;terity as &s;hall &s;ail therein, as a</HI> COMMON PROPERTY <HI>You &s;hall be all</HI> EQUAL OWNERS, <HI>and shall share the profits of every voyage equally among you.</HI> You &s;hall chu&s;e from among your&s;elves, one fit to be captain, another to be mate, another carpenter, &amp;c.&mdash;The&s;e officers &s;hall continue in office while you plea&s;e, and and when you plea&s;e you &s;hall change them for others, that your affairs may be conducted in the be&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible. At the end of the voy|age, or at other &s;tated times agreed upon, you &s;hall &s;ettle your accounts; and after paying the captain, the mate, and every other officer and man his wages, according to &s;tation and agree|ment, and all bills for upholding wear and tear, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. then the remainder, which is the neat profit of the voyage, and which would been mine had I retained the property of the &s;hip in my own hands, is now <HI>your</HI> common property, and mu&s;t be &s;hared equally among you all, without re&s;pect to any office any any one may have held. For as I make you all
<PB N="70" REF="71">equal owners, &s;o &s;hall you be equal &s;harers in the profits of each voyage. You are all equal to me, and you &s;hall be all equal in this re&s;pect to each other. Let not the captain, who re|ceives the wages of a captain, or any other offi|cer, who receives the wages of his &s;tation, mur|mer that his brethren before the ma&s;t, and who receive only the wages of common men, &s;hould receive &s;hare and &s;hare alike with him&s;elf of the profits. No my dear children, let no &s;uch un|ju&s;t and unbrotherly grudging ever he found among you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Again my &s;ons, as I have been ju&s;t and im|partial to you, be ye the &s;ame to <HI>your</HI> children. And when they &s;hall multiply &s;o that you can|not all &s;ail together in the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el, provide another &s;hip out of your common profits, for &s;uch of your&s;elves and your &s;ons as &s;hall chu&s;e to &s;ail together, which &s;hall be their common property in the &s;ame manner as this &s;hip is yours. This do, and live like men and brethren through all generations. And as a &s;warm of bees, when grown too numerous for one hive, &s;end off colonies to people new ones, &s;o when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of your &s;hips become too numerous, let new &s;hips be built, and manned on the &s;ame equitable plan that I have done, and my ble&s;&s;ing go with you.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e injunctions were received by the young men with inexpre&s;&s;ible joy. And having wrote them, they were called the con&s;titution of their MARINE REPUBLIC, and &s;wore to maintain them inviolate to the end of time. They then cho&s;e a captain, and other officers, and proceeded on a trading voyage, and being pro&s;perous they &s;hared very con&s;iderable dividends both at the end of this, and many future voyages.</P>
<P>In proce&s;s of time, however, it &s;o happened that the&s;e marine republicans were di&s;&s;atisfied with
<PB N="71" REF="72">the government of the country, in which they re&s;ided. Wherefore taking all their families and all their effects on board, they &s;et &s;ail for America, where they expected to &s;ee government admini&s;ter|ed more agreeably to their notions of equality and equity. But a violent &s;torm ari&s;ing, they were driven far out of their cour&s;e, and at la&s;t arrived at an uninhabited i&s;land of a luxurious &s;oil, and an agreeable climate. Here they gladly landed after much danger, and their &s;hip being &s;o damaged as to be no more fit for &s;ea, they determined to &s;ettle on the i&s;land. The &s;hip was now broke up, and hou&s;es built with the materials, and preparations were made to cultivate the &s;oil, as they mu&s;t now think of living by gardening and agriculture. But they fore&s;aw that if they did not apply the Marine Con&s;titution, given them by their father, to their landed property, they would &s;oon experience in|expre&s;&s;ible inconveniences. They therefore de|clared the property of the i&s;land to be the proper|ty of them all collectively in the &s;ame manner as the &s;hip had been, and that they ought to &s;hare the profits thereof in the &s;ame way. The i&s;land they named Spen&s;onia, after the name of the &s;hip which their father had given them. They next cho&s;e officers to mark out &s;uch portions of land, as every per&s;on or family de&s;ired to occupy, for which they were to receive for the u&s;e of the public, a certain rent according to its value. This rent was applied to public u&s;es, or divided among them&s;elves as they thought proper, But in order to keep up the remembrance of their rights, they decreed that they &s;hould never fail to &s;hare at rent-time, an equal dividend though ever &s;o &s;mall, and though public demands &s;hould be ever &s;o urgent.</P>
<P>They now &s;pread con&s;iderably over the country, and hou&s;es and work&s;hops were built at the public expence. The &s;pace inhabited became too exten|&s;ive for one di&s;trict, wherefore they divided it into
<PB N="72" REF="73">many, and called them pari&s;hes. As they had de|termined, when &s;eamen, that every &s;ucceeding &s;hip they &s;hould build, and man, &s;hould, according to their father's maxim, be the property of the crew, &s;o, in conformity therewith, they decreed, that every di&s;trict or pari&s;h which they &s;hould people, &s;hould be the property of the inhabitants, and the rents and police of the &s;ame at their di&s;po&s;al. Thus they live in union and equality on land, as their father intended they &s;hould do on &s;ea, and frame and people new pari&s;hes at the public ex|pence, as he de&s;igned they &s;hould build new &s;hips. A national a&s;&s;embly or congre&s;s con&s;i&s;ting of dele|gates from all the pari&s;hes, takes care of their na|tional concerns, and defrays the expences of &s;tate, and matters of common utility, by a pound rate from each pari&s;h, without any other tax.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Woe to thee O Land! when thy King is a Child, and thy Princes eat in the Morning!
<BIBL><HI>Ecc. e. x. ver. 16.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN rulers are intoxicated with ideas of power, and have their pa&s;&s;ions inflamed with di&s;&s;ipation, they are ready to imagine that the whole community are as fooli&s;h a them&s;elves; and for that rea&s;on endeavour to per&s;uade the peo|ple that it is faction to oppo&s;e their mea&s;ures, and trea&s;on to maintain their own rights.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e they will not mini&s;ter to the gratifi|cation of the lu&s;ts and appetites of tho&s;e who want to en&s;lave them, they are called factious and rebel|lious It is impo&s;&s;ible that rea&s;on can demand, that government which was in&s;tituted for the good of &s;ociety &s;hould be made the greate&s;t evil and the heavie&s;t cur&s;e. It could never be the intent of the appointment of government, that rulers &s;hould have a right to di&s;po&s;e of more than belonged to the right admini&s;tration thereof. With regard to o&s;tentations &s;plendor, it adds nothing to the dig|nity of government as a moral in&s;titution; for
<PB N="75" REF="76">there is more true dignity in a magi&s;trate executing ju&s;t laws in the home-&s;pun manufacture of his own country, than in one &s;upporting unrighteous de|crees, and arbitrary authority, dre&s;&s;ed in ermine, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> trimmed in gold</P>
<P>Mankind are not in general &s;o ignorant, as to &s;uppo&s;e that pageantry and &s;uper&s;tuity, add dig|nity to government, and they can perceive either the fool or the villain through all the garni&s;hing and trappings of office. Neither the &s;tar nor the garter are &s;o able to dazzle their eyes, as to hinder them from perceiving the black &s;pots that are underneath them, or, of di&s;cerning the wolf in &s;heep's cloathing. Rulers fondly imagine that the people are not qualified to di&s;cern the inju&s;tice of refu&s;ing their rea&s;onable reque&s;ts, and for that rea|&s;on &s;port them&s;elves with their petitions and re|mon&s;trances: but in this they di&s;play more their own want of judgment than the people do want of &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat &s;trange that princes have not learned from experience and ob&s;ervation, that all unnece&s;&s;ary expence and &s;plendour in government, are only progno&s;tications of the downfall of &s;tates and forerunners of their ruin. The Hi&s;tory of the &s;our great Monarchies, may &s;erve to in&s;truct all future generations of the folly of pageantry, and the unnece&s;&s;ary expence in the government of na|tions. Luxury and di&s;&s;ipation has generally pro|duced a define of dominion, and made princes neglect paying a ju&s;t regard to the complaints and grievances of their &s;ubjects; for they have been for the mo&s;t part, fonde&s;t of dominion when they were lea&s;t fit to govern, and near to their downfall.</P>
<P>It is undoubtedly a woeful thing to a nation, to be obliged to &s;upply the extravagances of men, who in&s;tead of ruling it with wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice, &s;pend the &s;ub&s;tance thereof in all the vile arts of
<PB N="76" REF="77">corruption and licentiou&s;ne&s;s. And what adds to this woe is, that they charge the people with being licentious, after they have taken all the pains in their power to make them &s;o.</P>
<P>Yet bad as the people in general may be, they would &s;hudder, at the thoughts of many acts of w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">kedne&s;s that are committed by their &s;uperiors. The cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge of licentiou&s;ne&s;s comes with an ill grace from tho&s;e who are living con&s;tantly in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of both divine and human laws, and lave nothing to &s;ave them from puni&s;hment, ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ept the partiality of government, and the indul|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce of divine mercy.</P>
<P>With regard to the charge of faction and rebel|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on which arbitrary rulers bring again&s;t the peo|ple, it may be returned upon them&s;elves, where the&s;e crimes are oftener to be found than among the people. It mu&s;t proceed from their not know|ing what is the nature of rebellion, that they do not take the charge home to them&s;elves:</P>
<P>The prophet I&s;aiah will help them to under&s;tand what is properly rebellion. <HI>Thy princes are rebel|lious and the companions of thieves, every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards, they judge not the fatherle&s;s, neither does the cau&s;e of the widow come be|fore them.</HI></P>

<HEAD>DUKE OF RICHMOND's LETTER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Extract of a letter from His Grace the DUKE of RICHMOND, to the Chairman of a Meeting of the County of Su&s;&s;ex, convened at Lewes, Janu|ary 18, 1783, for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;enting a petition to the Hou&s;e of Commons, to take into con&s;ideration the unequal &s;tate of Repre&s;entation in Parliament.</HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>Whitehall, <DATE>January 17, 1783.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU may ca&s;ily believe, that being one of tho&s;e who joined in reque&s;ting you to call a county meeting, nothing but illne&s;s can pre|vent me attending it, and it is with infinite regret I &s;ubmit to the deci&s;ion of my phy&s;icians, who pronounce, that it is not &s;afe for me to leave Lon|don.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t that my &s;entiments on the &s;ubject of <HI>Parliamentary Reform,</HI> are, in general &s;ufficiently known, and that, without further a&s;&s;urances, I might be <HI>depended upon for giving it every &s;upport in my power;</HI> but &s;ome circum&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nces make me wi&s;h to &s;tate them as briefly as po&s;&s;ible to the county of Su&s;&s;ex. They are formed on the <HI>experience of twenty-&s;ix years,</HI> which, whether in or out of government, has equally convinced me, that the <HI>Re&s;toration of a genuine Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> by a <HI>renovation</HI> of the <HI>Rights of the People,</HI> is the <HI>only e&s;&s;ential remedy</HI> again&s;t that <HI>&s;y&s;tem of corruption</HI> which has brought the na|tion to di&s;grace and poverty, and threatens it with the <HI>lo&s;s of liberty.</HI></P>
<P>I take the grievance of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of election to be its <HI>gro&s;s inequality.</HI> All the electors in Great Britain do not amount to <HI>one-&s;ixth</HI> part of the whole people, and a &s;till greater inequality &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in elections made by that &s;ixth part; for <HI>one-&s;eventh part of them</HI> elect a majority, &s;o that <HI>one-forty-&s;econd</HI> part of the nation, di&s;po&s;e of the <HI>pro|perty
<PB N="80" REF="81">of the whole,</HI> and have their <HI>lives and liberties at conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ad.</HI> And this forty-&s;econd part far from con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t opulent part of the kingdom, is compo&s;ed of the &s;mall boroughs, mo&s;t of which are become either the private property of indivi|duals, or are notoriou&s;ly &s;old to the be&s;t bidder: &s;o that counties and great cities are, in fact, as well as the great ma&s;s of the people &s;wallowed up by this <HI>&s;y&s;tem of corruption.</HI></P>
<P>My ideas of reform undoubtedly go to one that &s;hall be <HI>complete and general throughout the king|dom.</HI> I &s;ee &s;uch fatal con&s;equences ari&s;e from the pre&s;ent partial and accidental &s;tate of election, that I cannot take upon me to propo&s;e any new mode that partakes of the &s;ame defects. If we do not differ from the <HI>abettors of corruption</HI> upon the broad principle of equality in election, and the <HI>univer&s;al right of the people to be repre&s;ented,</HI> and are contend|ing only for a degree of partiality, more or le&s;s I fear our ground is not found; if we mean only to &s;ub&s;titute partiality for partiality, and are &s;trug|gli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g but for its extent, one man's whim may be as good as another's conceit, and we have nothing certain to direct us: and if inequality is &s;till to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, the advocates of the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem will have the &s;anction of time and the ri&s;k of changes, to oppo&s;e to us, which will have their weight, when it is but for a change of partiality that we contend.</P>
<P>I have thought that a <HI>Parliamentary Reform</HI> has much more &s;imple and unerring guides to lead us to our end: I mean the <HI>true principles of the Consti|tution,</HI> and the <HI>Rights of the People.</HI> If the&s;e exi&s;t, I do not con&s;ider my&s;elf at liberty to &s;peculate upon &s;y&s;tem. I have no choice, but to give to every man his own.</P>
<P>How far it is wi&s;e for tho&s;e who entirely agree in principle upon the <HI>Rights of Men,</HI> to endeavour to per&s;uade them that the <HI>recovery of their birth-rights,

<P>THE cour&s;e of events in this country has now for a number of generations for a long reach as it were of the &s;tream of time run &s;mooth, and our political duties have been proportionably ea&s;y; but it may not always be &s;o.

Could they tran&s;mit their virtues as well as names unto their po&s;terity, I &s;hould willingly become the advocate of &s;uch a nobility, and &s;uffer my ears to be bored to the po&s;ts of their doors; and rather acknowledge them our perpetual ma&s;ters and dictators, than hazard the choice of wor&s;e, upon the doubtful election of the people, with whom the be&s;t men are not always in greate&s;t reputation.</P>
<P>But &s;ince no choice can be more perilous and un&s;afe, than the ca&s;ual lot of nature, I had rather &s;tand to any election, than mere chance; by rea|&s;on we have oftener known fools the &s;ons of wi&s;e men by nature, than of the peoples choice or adop|tion. Honour is the crown and reward of virtue; is it not then un&s;eemly they &s;hould wear the badge and livery, that were never admitted within the utmo&s;t court of her temple, that are the very &s;laves and va&s;&s;als of vice and wickedne&s;s? I cannot but pay a greater tribute of re&s;pect and honour in my thoughts, to the worth of &s;uch as have rai&s;ed them&s;elves to a high degree and pitch of emi|nence, by the wings of their own merits, than to &s;uch as are only borne up by tho&s;e the credit and reputation of their ance&s;tors hath bequeathed unto them; wherefore that honour may be a &s;pur to valour, and the reward of virtue, let it not be pro&s;trated to every rich and &s;ordid mi&s;er, who by abandoning all virtue, ho&s;pitality and humanity, hath with much oppre&s;&s;ion and grinding the face of the poor, &s;craped much wealth together; but rather on &s;uch as by their valour and prudence,
<PB N="87" REF="88">have brought mo&s;t credit and reputation to the commonwealth: wherefore if the parliament plea&s;e out of &s;uch to create knights, or make the chiefe&s;t mini&s;ters of &s;tate lords by office, or during life, I &s;hould account it no &s;oleci&s;m in a commonwealth, but an ornament thereto.</P>
<P>Now the rea&s;on I look upon the divine, the lawyer, and hereditary nobility, as &s;uch irrecon|cileable antagoni&s;ts to a free &s;tate, is not grounded &s;ingly on the real prejudice they either have, or are like to receive therefrom; but rather, on what their fears and jealou&s;ies are apt to &s;ugge&s;t upon their apprehen&s;ions, being con&s;cious that their pri|vate intere&s;ts &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to that of the pub|lic; which could they be content to let go, and wave the advantages an injurious pre&s;cription hath given them over their brethren, their concerns would be equally interwoven and wound up with others in that of a commonwealth; and might find it alike propitious to them&s;elves with any other of like parts and ingenuity: but &s;uch is the evil na|ture of man, that to have done an injury, is a &s;uf|ficient ground for future enmity, and rather to pro|&s;ecute, than any way compen&s;ate tho&s;e that are in|debted for a former di&s;courte&s;y: therefore the be&s;t and the &s;oone&s;t way to be reconciled to &s;uch, is quickly to requite their injury; for mea&s;uring others thir&s;t of revenge, by the &s;tandard of their own malice, they can never believe any one is friends with them, &s;o long as he is in arrears to them for an ill turn: &s;o that their fear of revenge breeds di&s;tance, and that encrea&s;es alienation and di&s;affection, which brings forth farther ho&s;tility, with encrea&s;e of injuries. In analogy to which doctrine, the be&s;t way to give the antagoni&s;ts of the commonwealth ea&s;e, and its &s;elf &s;ecurity, is, by cau&s;ing their fears to fall upon them, and thereby deliver them from further pain, and the public from its jealou&s;ies and future danger; for it can
<PB N="88" REF="89">never be expected, they &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the intere&s;t of the public, before they have buried that of their private; that they &s;hould embark them&s;elves in the &s;ame bottom with that of the commonwealth, &s;o long as they have &s;o many of their own to look after; till the&s;e are &s;hipwrecked, they will not be much concerned in the &s;afety and pro&s;perity of the commonwealth.</P>
<P>We &s;hall never be &s;o well united in our affec|tions and de&s;igns for public good, as when we are become all of one piece, and to have but one com|mon intere&s;t: for it is nothing but the diver&s;ity of intere&s;ts that breaks us in pieces, and crumbles us into &s;o many different factions and de&s;igns; which as it was good policy in our monarchs, &s;o but bad prudence in a commonwealth: the intere&s;t of a prince being to break the &s;trength of his people, that one faction being balanced by another, he may with more ea&s;e and facility render him&s;elf ma&s;ter of all; according to the advice of the old maxim, <HI>Divide and Rule.</HI> But the &s;trength and glory of a commonwealth is its union. And indeed it had otherwi&s;e been impo&s;&s;ible, that ever princes &s;hould have been able to have tied up the hands of na|tions, and bound the &s;trength of <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> in cords, and bands of withies, had not their policy like that of the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> fir&s;t &s;horn their locks, and de|prived them of their &s;trength, had they not fir&s;t according to the fable of the faggot, loo&s;ed their bond of union, by &s;tarting many intere&s;ts, and kindling divers animo&s;ities among them, they had never fa&s;tened the cords of &s;lavery and bondage on them. The <HI>Philistines</HI> had never &s;ported them|&s;elves with <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> or <HI>Uli&s;&s;es</HI> with <HI>Polyphemas,</HI> had they not fir&s;t put out their eyes. Nor had <HI>Princes</HI> ever put a hook into the no&s;trils of the Leviathan, or played with the mighty Whale, had they not made u&s;e of a like &s;tratagem.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="90">Men complain much, and &s;eem to have a great &s;en&s;e of the many factions and divi&s;ions in religion, as they are plea&s;ed to term them; but how incon|&s;iderable are the&s;e to the grand national or civil factions. I confe&s;s tho&s;e of religion may &s;ometime be made u&s;e of to palliate, but there are other fac|tions, that are the bitter root of all our breaches and divi&s;ions: were there not one intere&s;t of the no|bility, another of the commonalty; one of the cler|gy, another of the laity; one of the lawyer, another of the countryman; one of the &s;oldier, another of the citizen; one of the elder, another of the younger brethren, we might &s;oon &s;ee an end of the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the intere&s;ts that cla&s;h &s;o much one again&s;t another, and make &s;uch tumults in the world; and were the&s;e once cancelled and for|gotten, the other of Pre&s;byterian and independent, Quaker and Anabapti&s;t, &amp;c. would &s;oon vani&s;h, or at lea&s;t, make little noi&s;e or di&s;turbance in the world.

But to proceed, &s;ince it hath plea&s;ed God once more to put a price into our hands, and cau&s;e another opportunity of recover|ing our native rights and liberties to dawn upon us, I de&s;ire we may not be as fools, not knowing how to u&s;e it; but that all ways that are &s;afe and honourable may be taken for the &s;ecuring and im|provement of it; and therefore that the builders of our &s;tate may be furni&s;hed with a &s;pirit of wi&s;|dom

The ancient com|monwealths have been nece&s;&s;itated to make u&s;e &s;ometimes of violent phy&s;ic, to purge and evacuate the rank humours of the body politic, and &s;uch as I would not have pre&s;cribed a chri&s;tian &s;tate, &s;up|po&s;ing there may be found out &s;uch as are more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e and gentle.

How often hath <HI>Greece,</HI> for the &s;ecu|rity of her liberty, &s;acrificed that life, by which &s;he hath formerly been pre&s;erved from ruin and de&s;truction?

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HARD indeed mu&s;t be the heart which is un|affected with the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s experienced by the Poor in general in this commercial nation. Thou&s;ands of hone&s;t and indu&s;trious people in Great Britain, are literally &s;tarving for want of bread; and the cau&s;e invariably a&s;&s;igned is a &s;tag|nant commerce. My opinion on this &s;ubject will perhaps appear to &s;ome a &s;trange phenomena&mdash;it is, that a &s;tagnant commerce is not the real cau&s;e of the want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life among the labo|rious poor. And I am confident, that while the "Earth yields her increa&s;e," there is a method founded on JUSTICE and REASON, to prevent the poor from wanting bread, be the &s;tate of trade whatever it may.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, then, I will a&s;k, What are the principle &s;ources of human &s;ub&s;i&s;tence? Certain|ly Corn and Gra&s;s Corn is moulded into many &s;hapes for the u&s;e of man, but chiefly into bread, which is the &s;taff of life; and from gra&s;s, we de|rive our fle&s;h, milk, butter, chee&s;e, &amp;c. be&s;ides wool and leather, which, I think, with the addi|tion of coal, and a few other minerals, nearly make up the real nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>I a&s;k again, then, who is &s;o infatuated as to &s;ay,
<PB N="98" REF="99">that the growing of corn or gra&s;s, is dependant on, or connected with the pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity of trade? Certainly (thank Heaven!) they are not affected by the devouring &s;word, or ruined com|merce (except at the &s;eat of war).&mdash;Corn grows not in the loom, nor Gra&s;s upon the anvil! Why is it then, that while there is plenty of bread the poor are &s;tarving? Is there not as much grain and gra&s;s in the land as when the trade flouri&s;hed? Suppo&s;e trade were to ri&s;e immediately to an amazing de|gree, would it make one grain of corn or blade of gra&s;s more? Certainly not. Why then, I a&s;k again, are the poor, who are the peculiar care of HIM who delights to do his needy creatures good, not &s;atisfied with the good of the land?</P>
<P>The following rea&s;ons are at lea&s;t &s;atisfactory to my&s;elf:&mdash;Becau&s;e, in the time of national pro&s;|perity, hou&s;e and land rent (con&s;equently provi|&s;ions are always rai&s;ed by the wealthy and volup|tuous, till they are, at lea&s;t at par with high wa|ges; but, when WAR, or any other cau&s;e has ruin|ed, or impeded commerce, and reduced wages, <HI>rents</HI> and <HI>provi&s;ions</HI> remain unabated, The poor calico weavers in the vicinity of Manche&s;ter, notoriou&s;ly illu&s;trate this argument, as they are now (they who can get any) working for fifty and &s;ixty per cent. le&s;s wages than at this time two years back, and the nece&s;&s;aries of life are rather agumented in their prices than dimini&s;hed!!!</P>
<P>Hearken, O ye poor of the Land! While great men have an unbounded power to rai&s;e <HI>their</HI> rents and <HI>your</HI> provi&s;ions&mdash;and, at the &s;ame time, an un|controuled power to make <HI>War,</HI> and con&s;equently to dry up, or dimini&s;h, the &s;cources of your income, your &s;ub&s;i&s;tance will, at the be&s;t, be precarious, and your very exi&s;tence often mi&s;erable!&mdash;The pre&s;ent want of Bread and Butcher's Meat among&s;t the Poor, is not owing to the want of Grain of Gra&s;s in the world, nor, I pre&s;ume, in this Land
<PB N="99" REF="100">but owing to the price of it being exce&s;&s;ively above the price of labour. When, therefore, the price of labour cannot be brought up to the rate of pro|vi&s;ions, provi&s;ions &s;hould be reduced to the rate of labour. Till this is practicable, the poor are mi|&s;erable!</P>
<P>During the la&s;t twenty years, mechanical wages have been varied according to circum&s;tances, &s;eve|ral times, and not unu&s;ually, in &s;ome branches, twenty, thirty, forty, and even fifty per cent.&mdash; I mean on the lowering, as well as the ri&s;ing &s;ide of the medium. But, with regard to <HI>land-rent,</HI> its variations have always been progre&s;&s;ive: and to find a &s;ingle in&s;tance to the contrary, would be al|mo&s;t, if not altogether, impo&s;&s;ible!</P>
<P>It requires but little &s;agacity to &s;ee, that the game laws, riot act, laws again&s;t vagrants and felons, &amp;c. &amp;c, are made chiefly for the &s;ecurity of the <HI>rich</HI> again&s;t the depredations of the <HI>poor.</HI> But what &s;ecurity have the <HI>poor</HI> again&s;t the op|pre&s;&s;ion and extortion of the <HI>rich?</HI> Certainly none at all. As every comfort of life is derived from land, and as the rich are the proprietors thereof, it may in &s;ome &s;en&s;e be &s;aid, that they hold the i&s;&s;ues of life and death; and, whil&s;t they can, uninter|ruptedly, rai&s;e their rents without limitation or re|&s;traint, they have an alarming and unbounded power over, not only the happine&s;s, but even the <HI>lives</HI> of the great ma&s;s of the people&mdash;the <HI>poor.</HI></P>
<P>If then, &s;tate&s;men have a right to advance their lands in times of pro&s;perity, the <HI>poor</HI> ought to have a parliament of their <HI>own chu&s;ing,</HI> inve&s;ted with power to reduce them in days of adver&s;ity. This balance of power between the <HI>rich</HI> and the <HI>poor,</HI> would be productive of a thou&s;and times more con|&s;olation to this nation, than the chimerical non|&s;en&s;e of court-jugglers, <HI>"the balance of power in Eu|rope."</HI> Nor can I imagine that any judicious per|&s;on would call &s;uch a power in parliament unju&s;t
<PB N="100" REF="101">or irrational, which when exerci&s;ed, could rum none, but ble&s;s millions! if it would be cruel to make a &s;tate&s;man of twenty thou&s;and pounds per annum, live a year or two upon ten thou&s;and pounds; how much more remor&s;ele&s;s is it, to make the Spi|talfield and Norwich weavers, as well as &s;ome hun|dred thou&s;ands more, live upon nothing&mdash;or, what is little better upon <HI>charity!!!</HI> Be&s;ides, it is a cu|rious truth, that the very &s;uperfluities which ruin hundreds of the voluptuous great, would render happy the innumerable unhappy part of mankind.</P>
<P>GREAT GOD! What &s;pectacle &s;o affecting to a reflecting mind as Great Britain in her pre&s;ent &s;tate!&mdash;On the one hand, we &s;ee the impudent nobles adverti&s;ing their <HI>"grand dinners,"</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>AN AMERICAN ANECDOTE.</P>
<P>An Indian, who lately came to one of the American &s;ettlements to barter away his furs, had beads and other &s;mall trinkets deli|vered to him, wrapt up in pieces of Engli&s;h new&s;papers. Curious to know what was going on in this country, he a&s;ked a trader WHO COULD READ, to explain the contents. The fir&s;t para|graph was&mdash;"Ye&s;terday his maje&s;ty, aceompanied by Lord C. and Lord W. and &s;everal other noblemen and gentlemen, took the diver&s;ion of hunting." The next, "The Wind&s;or hunt was la&s;t week mo&s;t numerou&s;ly attended;"&mdash;this was followed by "The Dutche&s;s of Gordon's SUPERB dinner, attended by all the cabinet mini&s;ters, except three, who had unfortunately SPLEN|DID dinners at their own hou&s;es, the &s;ame evening; but for the&s;e gentlemen, her grace has declared her intention of having a mag|nificient fea&s;t next week." The next paragraph was dated from York&s;hire, and gave a long account of Colonel Thornton's hounds having run a fox more than 50 miles. The reader was going on with the relation of &s;everal other dinners for LORDS and COMMONS, when the Indian interrupting him, cried out, "Stop, let me hear no more&mdash;I &s;ee that in what you call a civilized country, and boa&s;t &s;o much about, the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of life is the &s;ame as with us&mdash;HUNTING and FEASTING."</P></NOTE> in the very face of the hungry poor, whom they have ruined!! On the other hand, widows, orphans, and others, are weeping, and often dying for want of bread! What can be more odious in the &s;ight of Heaven, than fea&s;t and famine in the &s;ame na|tion?
<PB N="101" REF="102">Yet this is literally, the ca&s;e in this kingdom at this moment, and not only in the nation, but in every town, in every &s;treet, yea, often under the &s;ame roof!</P>
<P>Open your eyes. O ye poor of the land! in vain are your hands and your mouths open!&mdash;Do you not &s;ee how you are cajoled and degraded, by the paltry &s;ub&s;criptions made for you at different times and in various parts of the nation; which &s;erve only to make your &s;lavery more &s;ervile, and ba&s;e and your mi&s;ery of longer duration? I revere generous &s;ub&s;cribers and collectors, but I &s;corn the means! Ye poor, take a farther look into your rights, and you will &s;ee, that, upon the principles of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, every peaceable and u&s;eful per&s;on has a right, yea, a <HI>"divine right"</HI> to be &s;atisfied with the good of the land! &dagger; Be&s;ides, is it not mon&s;trou&s;|ly provoking to be robbed by whole&s;ale, and re|lieved by retail! Look again, and you will &s;ee that public collections, &s;ub&s;criptions and charities, are nothing more than the appendages of corruption, extortion, and oppre&s;&s;ion! If the benevolent fa|ther of the univer&s;e did not &s;end among&s;t mankind provi&s;ions enough, and more than enough and run|ning over, &s;uch is the wa&s;te of the great and the gluttonous, that many of you poor, would get none at all! Say not, therefore, ye oppre&s;&s;ed, <HI>"there is a famine, or &s;carcety of provi&s;ions in this land!"</HI> It would be fal&s;e. The land contains plenty; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f provi&s;ions were (as they ought to be) reduced to your wages, you would enjoy your unque&s;tion|able right; a comfortable &s;ufficiency.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the de&s;truction of your trade, and the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, you have the mortifica|tion to &s;ee your bread eaten by dragoon and hunting hor&s;es, &s;paniels, &amp;c. and your parental, affectionate, loving, provident and tender guar|dians, can give you a good rea&s;on why&mdash;it is their own!</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="103">Hearken! O ye poor of the land!

<HEAD>IN WHAT CASES WAR IS JUSTIFIABLE, &amp;C.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>[From the Per&s;ian Letters.]</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE magi&s;trate ought to do ju&s;tice between citizen and citizen: every nation ought to do the &s;ame between them&s;elves and another na|tion. This &s;econd di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice requires no maxim but what are u&s;ed in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Between nation and nation there is &s;eldom any want of a third to be umpire; becau&s;e the grounds of di&s;pute are almo&s;t always clear and ea&s;y to be determined. The intere&s;ts of two nations are ge|nerally &s;o far &s;eparated, that it requires nothing but to be a true lover of ju&s;tice to find it out.</P>
<P>It is not the &s;ame with regard to the differences that ari&s;e between private per&s;ons. As they live in &s;ociety, their intere&s;ts are &s;o mingled and con|founded, and there are &s;o many different &s;orts of them, that it is nece&s;&s;ary for a third per&s;on to un|tangle what the covetou&s;ne&s;s of the parties &s;trives to tie knots in,</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="114">There are but two &s;orts of ju&s;tifiable wars: that which we enter into for the repelling an enemy that attacks us; and that which we undertake in defence of an ally that is attacked.</P>
<P>There would be no equity in making war upon a prince's private quarrel; unle&s;s the ca&s;e were of that heinous nature as to de&s;erve the death of the prince or people that committed it. Thus a prince &s;hould not make war, for being denied &s;ome honour which was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght, or for any di&s;re&s;pect to his amba&s;&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> like trif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es: no more than a private <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to kill one that refu&s;es him the wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the rea&s;on is, that as a declaration of was i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an act of ju&s;tice wherein the puni&s;hment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> always bear proportion to the fault we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ider, whether the per&s;on we declare war again&s;t, is worthy of death. For to make war upon any one is to &s;eek to puni&s;h him with death.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;evere act of ju&s;tice in the law of na|tions is war; its end being the de&s;truction of &s;ociety,</P>
<P>Repri&s;als are of the &s;econd degree. To pro|portion the penalty to the crime, is a method which no tribunal could ever help ob&s;erving.</P>
<P>A third act of ju&s;tice is to deprive a prince of the advantages he reaps from our commerce, &s;till mea&s;uring the puni&s;hment by the offence.</P>
<P>The fourth act of ju&s;tice, which ought to be the mo&s;t frequent, is a renunciation of the al|liance of the people again&s;t whom we have cau&s;e of complaint. This penalty is an&s;werable to that of bani&s;hment in common tribunals, which cuts off the criminal from &s;ociety. So a prince who&s;e alliance we renounce, is thereby cut off from our &s;ociety, and is no longer one of our members.</P>
<P>There can be no greater affront done to a prince than to renounce his alliance, and no greater honour than to court it. There is nothing among
<PB N="114" REF="115">men more glorious nor more u&s;eful, than to have others concerned as watchful for their pre&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>But in order to make an alliance binding it mu&s;t be ju&s;t: &s;o that an alliance made between two na|tions to oppre&s;s a third, is not lawful, and may honourably and innocently be broke.</P>
<P>Neither does it become the dignity and reputa|tion of a prince to enter into an alliance with a tyrant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. We read that a certain Egyptian monarch &s;ent to reprehend the king of <HI>Samos</HI> for his cruelty and tyranny, calling upon him to amend: and upon his not doing it, he gave him to know that he renounced his friend&s;hip and alliance.</P>
<P>The right of conque&s;t is no right at all. A &s;o|ciety can never be founded upon any thing but the free con&s;ent of all the members: if it is de&s;troyed by conque&s;t, the people are thereby freed from their old engagements: it does not make a new &s;ociety; and if the conqueror goes about to do it, he acts the tyrant.</P>
<P>As to treaties of peace, they are never lawful when they ordain a ce&s;&s;ion or reparation more con&s;iderable than the damage done: this is mere violence, and may at any time be lawfully &s;et a&s;ide; unle&s;s in order to recover what we have lo&s;t, we are obliged to have recour&s;e to &s;uch vio|lent methods as will create mi&s;chiefs greater than the advantage &s;ought after.</P>

<P>And accordingly the power of the <HI>European</HI> kings is very great, and one may venture to &s;ay,
<PB N="116" REF="117">as great as they plea&s;e to make it: but they do not &s;tretch it &s;o far as our &s;ultans: fir&s;t, becau&s;e they would not &s;hock the manners and religion of their &s;ubjects. Secondly, becau&s;e it is not their intere&s;t to carry it &s;o far.</P>
<P>Nothing brings down a prince &s;o near to the condition of his &s;ubjects, as exerci&s;ing an extra|vagant power over them: nothing expo&s;es them &s;o much to the turns and caprices of fortune.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom they u&s;e of cau&s;ing all that offend them to be put to death upon the lea&s;t &s;ignal, over|throws the proportion which ought to be kept be|tween the faults and the puni&s;hments, which is in a manner the &s;oul of a &s;tate, and the harmony of an empire; and this proportion being &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved by the chri&s;tian princes, gives them an infinite advantage above our &s;ultans.</P>
<P>A Per&s;ian who, either by imprudence or misfor|tune, has drawn upon him&s;elf the di&s;plea&s;ure of his prince, is &s;ure of death: the lea&s;t fault or the lea&s;t caprice brings him into this ca&s;e. But if he had attempted the life of his &s;overeign; if he had gone about to betray his &s;trong towns to the ene|my; he could &s;till but lo&s;e his life: therefore he runs no greater ri&s;k in this la&s;t ca&s;e than in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>So that upon the lea&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure finding death unavoidable, and having nothing wor&s;e to fear, he is naturally inclined to di&s;turb the peace of the &s;tate and to con&s;pire again&s;t his &s;overeign; this being the only refuge he has left.</P>
<P>It is not &s;o with the great men in Europe, who lo&s;e nothing by being di&s;graced, but the good-will and favour of their prince: they retire from court and think of nothing but enjoying a quiet life, and the advantages of their birth. As they &s;eldom for|feit their lives but for high trea&s;on, they are fear|ful of being drawn into it, con&s;idering how much they have to lo&s;e, and how little to gain; which
<PB N="117" REF="118">is the rea&s;on that here we &s;eldom &s;ee rebellions, or kings de&s;troyed by violent deaths.</P>
<P>If in the unlimited authority our princes po&s;|&s;e&s;s, they did not u&s;e &s;o many precautions to guard their lives, they would none of them live a day; and if they did not keep in pay an infinite number of troops to tyrannize over the re&s;t of their &s;ub|jects, their empire would not &s;ub&s;i&s;t a month.</P>

<HEAD>ERSKINE's DEFENCE OF PAINE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[<HI>Continued from page</HI> 228. <HI>vol. I.</HI>]</HEAD>
<P>SUCH were the words of that great good man, lo&s;t with tho&s;e of many others of his time, and his fame, as far as power could hurt it, put in the &s;hade along with them. The con&s;equences we
<PB N="118" REF="119">have all &s;een and felt; America, from an obedient affectionate colony, became an independent na|tion; and two millions of people, nur&s;ed in the very lap of our monarchy, became the willing &s;ubjects of a republican con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, in that great and calamitous con|flict Mr. Burke and Mr. Paine fought in the &s;ame field of rea&s;on together, but with very different &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Mr. Burke &s;poke to a parliament in England, &s;uch as Sir George Saville de&s;cribes it, that had no ears but for &s;ounds that flattered its corruptions. Mr. Paine, on the other hand, &s;poke TO A PEOPLE; rea&s;oned with them, that they were bound by no &s;ubjection to any &s;overeignty, further than their own benefits connected them; and by the&s;e powerful arguments prepared the minds of the American people for that GLORIOUS, JUST, and HAPPY revolution.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have a right to di&s;tingui&s;h it by that appellation, becau&s;e I aver that at this mo|ment there is as &s;acred a regard to property; as inviolable a &s;ecurity to all the rights of individu|als; lower taxes! fewer grievances; le&s;s to de|plore, and more to admire, in the con&s;titution of America, than that of any other country under heaven. I wi&s;h indeed to except our own, but I cannot even do that till it &s;hall be purged of tho&s;e abu&s;es, which, though they ob&s;cure and deform the &s;urface, have not as yet <HI>(thank God)</HI> de&s;troyed the vital parts.</P>
<P>Why then is Mr. Paine to be calumniated, and reviled, becau&s;e out of a people con&s;i&s;ting of near three millions, he alone did not remain attached in opinion to a monarchy. Remember, that all the blood which was &s;hed in America, and to which he was for years a melancholy and indig|nant witne&s;s, was &s;hed by the authority of the crown of Great Britain, under the influence of its parliament, &s;uch as Sir George Saville has
<PB N="119" REF="120">de&s;cribed it, and &s;uch as Mr. Burke him&s;elf will be called upon by and by in more glowing colours to paint it. How then can it be wondered at, that Mr. Paine &s;hould return to this country in his heart a republican? Was he not equally repub|lican when he wrote common &s;en&s;e? yet that vo|lume has been &s;old without re&s;traint or pro&s;ecu|tion in every &s;hop in England ever &s;ince, and which neverthele&s;s <HI>(I appeal to the book, which I have in court, and which is in every body's hands)</HI> contains every one principle of government, and every abu&s;e in the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, which is to be &s;ound in the Rights of Man. Yet Mr. Burke him&s;elf &s;aw no rea&s;on to be alarmed at its publica|tion, nor to cry down its contents, even when America, which was &s;wayed by it, was in arms again&s;t the crown of Great Britain. You &s;hall hear his opinion of it, in his letter to the &s;heriffs of Bri&s;tol, page 33 and 34.</P>
<P><Q>The Court Gazettee accompli&s;hed what the abettors of independence had attempted in vain. When that di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ingenuous compilation, and &s;trange medley of railing and flattery, was adduced, as a proof of the united &s;entiments of the people of Great Britain, there was a great change throughout all America. The tide of popular affection, which had &s;till &s;et to wards the parent country, began immediately to turn, and to &s;low with great rapidity in a contrary cour&s;e. Far from concealing the&s;e wild declarations of enmity, <HI>the author of the celebrated pamphlet which prepared the minds of the people for independence,</HI> in&s;i&s;ts largely on the multitude and the &s;pirit of the&s;e addre&s;&s;es; and draws an argument from them, which (if the fact were as he &s;uppo&s;es) mu&s;t be irre&s;i&s;tible. For I never knew a writer on the theory of government &s;o partial to au|thority, as not to allow, that the ho&s;tile mind of the rulers to their people, did fully ju&s;tify
<PB N="120" REF="121">a change of government; nor can any rea&s;on whatever be given, why one people &s;hould vo|luntarily yield any degree of pre-eminence to another, but on a &s;uppo&s;ition of great affection and benevolence towards them. Unfortunately for rulers, tru&s;ting to other things, took no no|tice of this great principle of connexion.</Q></P>
<P>But there is a time it &s;eems for all things.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the con&s;equences of this mighty re|volution are too notorious to require illu&s;tration. No audience would &s;it to hear (what every body has &s;een and felt,) the independence of America notoriou&s;ly produced, not by remote and circuitous effect, but directly and palpably, the revolutions that now agitate Europe, and which portend &s;uch new changes over the face of the earth. Let governors take warning. The revolution in France was the con&s;equence of her incurably corrupt and profligate government. God forbid that I &s;hould be thought to lean, by this declaration, upon her unfortunate monarch, bending, perhaps at this moment, under affliction which my heart &s;inks within me to think of; but, when I &s;peak with dete&s;tation of the former politics of the French court, I fa&s;ten as little of them upon that fallen and unhappy prince, as I impute to our gracious &s;overeign the corruptions of our own government. I de&s;ire, indeed, in the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted manner, to be under&s;tood that I mean to &s;peak of his maje&s;ty, not only with that obedience and duty which I owe to him as a &s;ubject, but with that ju&s;tice which I think is due to him from all men who examine his conduct either in public or private life.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, Mr. Paine happened to be in Eng|land when the French revolution took place, and notwith&s;tanding what he may be &s;uppo&s;ed and allowed from his hi&s;tory to have felt upon &s;uch a &s;ubject, he continued wholly &s;ilent and inactive. The people of this country too appeared to be in|different
<PB N="121" REF="122">&s;pectators of the animating &s;cene. They &s;aw, without vi&s;ible emotion, de&s;poti&s;m de&s;troyed, and the king of France, by his own con&s;ent, be|come the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of a free people. Cer|tainly, at lea&s;t, it produced none of tho&s;e effects which are &s;o deprecated by government at pre|&s;ent; nor, mo&s;t probably, ever would, if it had not occurred to the celebrated per&s;on, who&s;e name I mu&s;t &s;o often mention, voluntarily to provoke the &s;ubject; a &s;ubject which, if dangerous to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, he &s;hould not have led to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; for, &s;urely, it is not to be endured, that any pri|vate man is to publi&s;h a creed for a whole nation: to tell us that we are not to think for our&s;elves&mdash; to impo&s;e his own fetters upon the human mind&mdash; to dogmatize at di&s;cretion&mdash;and that no man &s;hall &s;it down to an&s;wer him without being guilty of a libel!!! I a&s;&s;ert, that if it be a libel to mi&s;take our con&s;titution&mdash;to &s;upport it by means that tend to de&s;troy it&mdash;and to choo&s;e the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ea&s;on for the interference, Mr. Burke is that libeller; but not therefore the object of a criminal pro&s;ecu|tion: for, whil&s;t I am defending the motives of one man, I have neither right nor di&s;po&s;ition to criminate the motives of another. All I contend for, is a fact that cannot be controverted, viz. that this officious interference was the origin of Mr. Paine's book. I put my cau&s;e upon its being the origin of it&mdash;the avowed origin&mdash;as will abundantly appear from the introduction and preface to both parts, and throughout the whole body of the work; nay, from the very work of Mr. Burke him&s;elf, to which both of them are an&s;wers.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, for the hi&s;tory of that celebrated work, I appeal to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>When the French revolution had arrived at &s;ome of its early &s;tages, a few, and but a few, per|&s;ons (not to be named when compared with the nation) took a vi&s;ible intere&s;t in the&s;e mighty
<PB N="122" REF="123">events; and intere&s;t well becoming Engli&s;hmen. They &s;aw a pernicious &s;y&s;tem of government, which had led to cruel de&s;olating wars, and had been for ages the &s;courge of Great Britain, giving way to a &s;y&s;tem which &s;eemed to promi&s;e harmony and peace among&s;t the nations. They &s;aw this with virtuous and peaceable &s;atisfaction: And a reve|rend divine [Dr. Price] eminent for his eloquence, recollecting that the i&s;&s;ues of life are in the hands of God, &s;aw no profanene&s;s in mixing the &s;ubject with public thank&s;giving; reminding the people of this country of their own glorious deliverance in former ages. It happened, al&s;o, that a &s;ociety of gentlemen, France being then a neutral nation, and her own monarch <HI>&s;wearing almo&s;t daily upon her altars to maintain the new con&s;titution,</HI> thought they infringed no law by &s;ending a general congratula|tion. Their numbers, indeed, were very incon|&s;iderable, &s;o much &s;o, that Mr. Burke, with more truth than wi&s;dom, begins his volume with a &s;ar|ca&s;m upon their in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P><Q>Until very lately he had never heard of &s;uch a club. It certainly never occupied a moment of his thoughts; nor, he believed, tho&s;e of any per&s;on out of their own &s;et.</Q></P>
<P>Why then make the&s;e proceedings the &s;ubject of alarm throughout England?&mdash;There had been no pro&s;ecution again&s;t them, nor any charge founded upon &s;u&s;picion of di&s;affection again&s;t any of their body. But Mr. Burke thought it was re&s;erved for his eloquence to whip the&s;e curs of faction to their kennel. How he has &s;ucceeded, I appeal to all that has happened &s;ince the introduction of his &s;chi&s;m in the Briti&s;h empire, by giving to the king, who&s;e title was que&s;tioned by no man, a title which it is his maje&s;ty's mo&s;t &s;olemn intere&s;t to di&s;claim.</P>
<P>After having in his fir&s;t work, la&s;hed Dr. Price in a &s;train of eloquent irony for con&s;idering the
<PB N="123" REF="124">monarchy to be elective, which he could not but know Dr. Price, in the literal &s;en&s;e of election, neither did or could po&s;&s;ibly con&s;ider it. Mr. Burke publi&s;hed a &s;econd treati&s;e, in which, after reprinting many pa&s;&s;ages from Mr. Paine's former work, he ridicules and denies the &s;uppo&s;ed right of the people to change their government, in the following words:</P>
<P>"The French revolution, <HI>&s;ay they,</HI>" (&s;peaking of the Engli&s;h &s;ocieties) <Q>was the act of the ma|jority of the people; and if the majority of any other people, <HI>the people of England, for in&s;tance,</HI> wi&s;h to make the &s;ame change, they have the &s;ame right; ju&s;t the &s;ame undoubtedly; that is, none at all.</Q></P>
<P>And then, after &s;peaking of the &s;ub&s;erviency of will to duty, (in which I agree with him,) he, in a &s;ub&s;tantive &s;entence, maintains the &s;ame doc|trine; thus;</P>
<P><Q>The con&s;titution of a country being once &s;et|tled upon &s;ome compact, tacit or expre&s;&s;ed, there is no power exi&s;ting of force to alter it, without the breach of the covenant, or the con&s;ent of all the parties. Such is the nature of a contract.</Q></P>
<P>So that if rea&s;on, or even Revelation it&s;elf, were now to demon&s;trate to us, that our con&s;titution was mi&s;chievous in its effects; that, to u&s;e Mr. Attorney-General's expre&s;&s;ion, we had been in|&s;anes for the many centuries we have &s;upported it; yet that &s;till, if the king had not forfeited his title to the crown, nor the lords their privileges, the univer&s;al voice of the whole people of England could not build up a new government upon a legi|timate ba&s;is.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, not to argue for the pre&s;ent again&s;t &s;uch a propo&s;ition, and &s;uppo&s;ing it could, beyond all controver&s;y, be maintained; for heaven's &s;ake, let wi&s;dom never utter it! If you &s;eek the &s;tability of the Engli&s;h government, rather put the book
<PB N="124" REF="125">of Mr. Paine which calls it bad, into every hand in the kingdom, than doctrines which bid human nature rebel even again&s;t that which is the be&s;t.&mdash; Say to the people of England, look at your con&s;ti|tution, there it lies before you&mdash;the work of your pious fathers, handed down as a &s;acred depo&s;it from generation to generation, the re&s;ult of wi&s;|dom and virtue, and its parts cemented together with kindred blood. There are indeed a few &s;pots upon its &s;urface; but the &s;ame principle which reared the &s;tructure will bru&s;h them all away; you may keep it, or you may de&s;troy it.&mdash;To &s;uch an addre&s;s, what would be the an&s;wer? A chorus of the nation.&mdash;<HI>Yes, we will pre&s;erve it.</HI> But &s;ay to the &s;ame nation, even of the very &s;ame con&s;titution, it is yours, &s;uch as it is, for better or for wor&s;e; it is &s;trapped upon your backs, to carry it as bea&s;ts of burthen, and you have no juri&s;diction to ca&s;t it off. Let this be your po&s;ition, and you in&s;tantly rai&s;e up (I appeal to every man's con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own nature) a &s;pirit of unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;con|tent. Yet it is the controver&s;y alone, which this u&s;ele&s;s and mi&s;chievous propo&s;ition &s;tirred up, that has pointed mo&s;t of the pa&s;&s;ages arraigned before you, which it will be pre&s;ently my duty to explain.</P>
<P>But let the prudence of the argument be what it may, the argument it&s;elf is untenable.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE UTILITY OF POLITICAL SOCIETIES.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>[From Cooper's Reply to Burke.]</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS outcry again&s;t the exi&s;tence and mutual corre&s;pondence of political &s;ocieties, foreign and dome&s;tic, is no &s;light argument of their utility. It amounts to proof that this means of communi|cating knowledge to the public, is likely to be at|tended with beneficial effects to the be&s;t intere&s;ts of mankind, or it would not be an object of &s;o much alarm to the pen&s;ioned advocates of ari&s;to|cracy. The people now &s;ee the great importance of political enquiries, and exten&s;ive influence of the maxims of government; which operate directly or indirectly on every moment of our exi&s;tence, and every action of our lives. They perceive much to learn, and much to unlearn on the que&s;tion of civil government; they expect as their right, a free acce&s;s to all peaceable means of information, and exclaim with rea&s;on, <Q>we will be kept in the trammels of implicit belief no longer.</Q></P>
<P>However plain and &s;imple the true principles of government may be, when dive&s;ted of that garb of complication and my&s;tery in which &s;tate-craft has enveloped them, it is certain that they are not yet fully &s;ettled among tho&s;e who profe&s;s to write, and rea&s;on on the &s;ubject. The be&s;t political writers of the pre&s;ent day, among the Engli&s;h and French, are not agreed on points of con&s;iderable moment; and Mr. Burke him&s;elf has taken no &s;mall pains to magnify the difficulties attending a branch of knowledge, of which, he dreads while he promotes the public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Difficulties there are; &s;uch as ignorance and artifice have created; but if they exi&s;t, (of whatever kind they may be) why throw ob&s;tacles in the way of enquiry, and deny the means of removing them? At any rate, Mr. Burke, who&s;e time for two years pa&s;t, has been
<PB N="130" REF="131">chiefly occupied in publi&s;hing di&s;cour&s;es of poli|tical my&s;tici&s;in, ought to be the la&s;t to cry out again&s;t any &s;ource of information on a &s;ubject which he has laboured &s;o indefatigably to ob&s;cure. &mdash;Equally aware, that public ignorance is the in|tere&s;ts of courts, and public information the in|tere&s;t of the people, the patriotic &s;ocieties of France and England, profe&s;s the &s;ame general principles of equal liberty, and have preci&s;ely the &s;ame <HI>general</HI> object in view, viz. the improvement and propagation of political knowledge. In France, as is natural, they di&s;cu&s;s the temporary occurrences of their own country; we, tho&s;e of ours; but the &s;ame &s;cience and the &s;ame principles are equally applicable to both. The&s;e &s;ocieties, in each kingdom, entertaining therefore the &s;ame general de&s;ign of extending the bounds of know|ledge on the mo&s;t important of all &s;ubjects of en|quiry, can it be deemed improper or unbecoming, that they &s;hould mutually communicate for a com|mon purpo&s;e? Is there any impropriety in the <HI>philo&s;ephical</HI> &s;ocieties of London, Paris, or Stock|holm, corre&s;ponding for the improvement of che|mi&s;try, or experimental philo&s;ophy? On the con|trary, do they not all court corre&s;pondencies, as the mo&s;t effectual means of diffu&s;ing information? Why then &s;hould &s;ocieties in&s;tituted for the pro|motion of <HI>political</HI> knowledge, be debarred from the common means of improvement? If it be a crime to enlighten the people upon the &s;ubject of politics, why do not our adver&s;aries &s;ay &s;o at once, and take that ground of accu&s;ation: if it be no crime, why deny the common methods of com|munication permitted and adopted in every other branch of human &s;cience.</P>
<P>But after all, why this anxiety among the go|vernments of Europe (our own among the re&s;t) to &s;top the progre&s;s of knowledge, and cut off the &s;ources of political information? Why this dread
<PB N="131" REF="132">le&s;t the people (the <HI>&s;wini&s;h multitude,</HI> as their friend, Mr. Burke, calls them) &s;hould think too much, and rea&s;on too much on their own rights, and their own intere&s;ts; le&s;t the deep veil of my&s;tery, which &s;tate-craft has thrown over the &s;cience of government, &s;hould perchance be with|drawn, and the tran&s;actions of court-polities be expo&s;ed to public ob&s;ervation? If the foundations of the&s;e gaudy &s;uper&s;tructures be un&s;ound, this conduct is ea&s;ily explained: but if governments do actually mean well, if their principles and actions will bear examination, why this general dread of inve&s;tigation?

<P>The author of a pamphlet called, "Peace and Reform," charges our divines, with recom|mending a conduct equally &s;anguinary with the French; and infers there from, that French prin|ciples of liberty are no more to be condemned on account of the exce&s;&s;es committed by a part of that nation, than the Briti&s;h con&s;titution is to be condemned on account of the exce&s;&s;es recom|mended from the pulpit. The following is the pa&s;&s;age we allude to:</P>
<P>THE fa&s;t-day, in&s;tead of being pa&s;&s;ed in con|formity with its profe&s;&s;ed purpo&s;e, in hu|miliation
<PB N="132" REF="133">before God, in prayers for the conver|&s;ion of unbelievers, the reformation of our&s;elves, and the general peace and happine&s;s of mankind; in&s;tead of a day on which every prie&s;t made an ex|traordinary exertion of his powers in imploring the benevolence of the Almighty to enlighten the minds, to &s;often the hearts, and to &s;pare the blood of his people, it was chiefly celebrated by the mo&s;t dreadful maledictions. The Supreme Being, who, true religion tells us, enjoins brotherly love, for|givene&s;s, humanity and virtue, was addre&s;&s;ed by our Divines as if he had been more mercile&s;s and blood-thir&s;ty than any divinity that ever di&s;graced Pagani&s;m; and the temples of the God of Peace were made to re&s;ound with imprecations, from which even our ance&s;tors would have recoiled when engaged in the wor&s;hip of their &s;erocious Odin, whom they revered as <Q>the terrible and &s;evere God; the active roaring Deity; the fa|ther of &s;laughter; the God that carrieth de&s;o|lation and fire, and nameth tho&s;e that are to be flain.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Edda.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The &s;olemnity of the &s;cene was well calculated for rou&s;ing and mi&s;leading the pa&s;&s;ions, and every artifice was employed to excite hatred towards the French, and provoke us to fury. The prie&s;thood, as well as the princes, felt them&s;elves intere&s;ted in the cau&s;e, and their zeal &s;hook the pulpit with exhortations to vengeance. The bi&s;hop of Glou|ce&s;ter, before the hou&s;e of lords, thus &s;poke of that nation:&mdash; <Q>Infatuated and remor&s;ele&s;s peo|ple! The mea&s;ure of your iniquities &s;eems a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> length to be full; the hour of retribution is coming fa&s;t upon you! Drunk with the blood of your fellow-citizens, you have dared to &s;pread your ravages abroad; rou&s;ing the &s;urrounding nations, in ju&s;tice to them&s;elves and the common
<PB N="133" REF="134">cau&s;e of humanity, to confederate again&s;t you, in order to execute the wrath of God on your de|voted heads.</Q> His lord&s;hip, however, might have been re&s;trained from &s;uch ra&s;h denunciations of divine judgment, by the awful admonitions of the founder of that religion which he pretended to preach.</P>
<P><Q>And Je&s;us an&s;wering, &s;aid, &s;uppo&s;e ye the&s;e Galileans were &s;inners above all the Galileans, becau&s;e they &s;uffered &s;uch things? I tell you nay; but except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h.</Q></P>

<P>The other Fa&s;t Day Sermons were in uni&s;on with that of the bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, with a very few exceptions. The Rev. J.

To exterminate for opinion! What more did Marat ever de&s;ire! To be the in&s;trument of God in executing his vengeance, Mahomet u&s;ed
<PB N="134" REF="135">the &s;ame plea for all his murders and rapine! To era&s;e a whole nation from the earth!!! Neither Mahomet, Marat, nor Rober&s;pierre, have equalled this! How limited and in&s;ignificant have been their pro&s;criptions compared with tho&s;e of our own pious pa&s;tors, who would <Q>&s;eal on the forehead as the &s;ervants of God<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide Revelations, c. vii. v. 3.</NOTE></Q> all tho&s;e who make war again&s;t France; who would <Q>&s;end myriads of locu&s;ts, with crowns like gold upon their heads, and faces like men, inve&s;ted with &s;cor|pion power, to torment the un&s;ealed</Q> enthu|&s;ia&s;ts of that di&s;tracted nation, and <Q>let loo&s;e the angels of the Euphrates to &s;laughter a third part of mankind.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide Revelations, c. ix.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Similar pa&s;&s;ages from the &s;ermons preached on that chri&s;tian day would fill a volume. Mo&s;t of them tend to inflame the people to a war of exter|mination, and in&s;inuate the de&s;truction of tho&s;e who de&s;ire a parliamentary reform. Surely our di|vines cannot be &s;o much mi&s;taken as to imagine the&s;e harangues gratifying to the head of the church? Their affection towards the crown, in|deed, is natural. The bi&s;hop of Durham's promo|tion has taught them the road to preferment; and my lord of Glouce&s;ter has been long looking for a tran&s;lation: but not &s;uch as Elijah's: His pre&s;ent ambition looks no higher than Canterbury.</P>
<P>Nor were the &s;ermons publicly preached more inflammatory than the writings anonymou&s;ly pub|li&s;hed by our high church men: one of which, in Birmingham, under the fictitious name of Job Nott, thus &s;peaks of tho&s;e whom it calls <Q>New-fa&s;hioned, re&s;tle&s;s di&s;&s;enters,</Q> and the members of a &s;ociety in&s;tituted on the principles of Mr. Pitt and the duke of Richmond for procuring a reform of parliament, <Q>Do be off; only think of the New Drop; you may be recorded in the New-gate
<PB N="135" REF="136">Calender; tran&s;portation may reform you; you de&s;erve to be highly exalted; did you ever &s;ee the New Drop!</Q> and concludes with wi&s;h|ing that the&s;e di&s;&s;enters and reformers, whom it deems factious, "tied in their garters may &s;wing." Yet the author of this elegant book calls him&s;elf a friend to conciliation and unanimity, a moderate man, a man of peace! He may be &s;o for a Birming|ham man; but if &s;uch are the friends to peace and moderation in that town, can we wonder at the atrocities, which have taken place there, and &s;till may be repeated, while Job Nott, and &s;uch publi|cations are publicly &s;old with a book&s;eller's name to them, and are even boa&s;ted of by their authors.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE COMMON PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>(From Ro&s;&s;eau's Emilius.)</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is the populace which compo&s;e the bulk of mankind: tho&s;e which are not in this cla&s;s are &s;o few in number, that they are hardly worth no|tice. Man is the &s;ame creature in every &s;tate; therefore that which is the mo&s;t numerous ought to be mo&s;t re&s;pected. To a man capable of reflec|tion, all civil di&s;tinctions are nothing: he ob&s;erves, the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, the &s;ame feelings, in the clown and the man of quality; the principal differ|ence between them con&s;i&s;ts in the language they &s;peak; in a little refinement of expre&s;&s;ion: but if there be any real di&s;tinction, it is certainly to the di&s;advantage of the lea&s;t &s;incere. The common people appear as they really are, and they are not amiable: if tho&s;e in high-life were equally undi&s;|gui&s;ed, their appearance would make us &s;hudder with horror.</P>
<P>There is, &s;ay our philo&s;ophers, an equal allot|ment of happine&s;s and mi&s;ery to every rank of men; a maxim as dangerous as it is ab&s;urd. If all man|kind
<PB N="136" REF="137">are equally happy, it would be ridiculous to give our&s;elves any trouble to promote their felici|ty. Let each remain in his &s;ituation: let the &s;lave endure the la&s;h, the lame his infirmity, and let the beggar peri&s;h, &s;ince they would gain nothing by a change of &s;ituation. The &s;ame philo&s;ophers enu|merate the pangs of the rich, and expatiate on the v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mity of their plea&s;ures; was there ever &s;o palpa|ble a &s;ophi&s;m! the pangs of a rich man are not e&s;|&s;ential to riches, but to the abu&s;e of them. If he were even more wretched than the poor, he would de&s;erve no compa&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e he is the creator of his own mi&s;ery, and happine&s;s was in his power. But the &s;ufferings of the indigent are the natural con&s;equences of his &s;tate; he feels the weight of his hard lot; no length of time, no habit can ever render him in&s;en&s;ible of fatigue and hunger; nei|ther wi&s;dom nor good humour can annihilate the evils which are in&s;eparable from his &s;ituation.&mdash;What avails it an Epictetus to for&s;ee that his ma&s;|ter is going to break his leg? Doth that prevent the evil! on the contrary, his fore knowledge adds greatly to his misfortune.

<HEAD>ON KINGS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Godwin's Enquiry concerning Political Ju&s;tice.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[<HI>Continued from page</HI> 220, <HI>Vol.</HI> 1.]</HEAD>
<P>IF kings were exhibited &s;imply as they are in them&s;elves to the in&s;pection of mankind, the &s;alutary prejudice, as it has been called, which teaches us to venerate them, would &s;peedily be ex|tinct; it has therefore been found nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ur|round them with luxury and expence. Thus are luxury and expence made the &s;tandard of honour, and of con&s;equence the topics of anxiety and envy, However fatal this &s;entiment may be to the mo|rality and happine&s;s of mankind, it is one of tho&s;e illu&s;ions which monarchical government is eager to cheri&s;h. In reality, the fir&s;t principle of virtu|ous feeling, as has been el&s;ewhere &s;aid, is the love of independence. He that would be ju&s;t mu&s;t before all things e&s;timate the objects about him at their true value. But the principle in regal &s;tates has been to think your father the wi&s;e&s;t of men becau&s;e he is your father, and your king the foremo&s;t of his &s;pecies becau&s;e he is a king. The &s;tandard of in|tellectual merit is no longer the man but his title. To be drawn in a coach of &s;tate by eight milk-white hor&s;es is the highe&s;t of all human claims to our ve|neration. The &s;ame principle inevitably runs through every order of the &s;tate, and men de&s;ire wealth under a monarchical government, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that under other circum&s;tances they would have de&s;ired virtue.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e an individual who by &s;evere la|bour earns a &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, to become by ac|cident or curio&s;ity a &s;pectator of the pomp of a royal progre&s;s. Is it po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould not mentally apo&s;trophi&s;e this elevated mortal, and a&s;k, "What
<PB N="138" REF="139">has made thee to differ from me?" If no &s;uch &s;en|timent pa&s;s through his mind, it is a proof that the corrupt in&s;titutions of &s;ociety have already dive&s;t|ed him of all &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice. The more &s;imple and direct is his character, the more certainly will the&s;e &s;entiments occur. What an&s;wer &s;hall we re|turn to his enquiry? That the well being of &s;ocie|ty requires men to be treated otherwi&s;e than accord|ing to their intrin&s;ic merit? Whether he be &s;atis|fied with this an&s;wer or no, will he not a&s;pire to po&s;&s;e&s;s that (which in this in&s;tance is wealth) to which the policy of mankind has annexed &s;uch high di&s;tinction? Is it not indi&s;pen&s;ible, that, before he believes in the rectitude of this in&s;titution, his original feelings of right and wrong &s;hould be whol|ly rever&s;ed? If it be indi&s;pen&s;ible, then let the ad|vocate of the monarchical &s;y&s;tem ingenou&s;ly declare, that, according to that &s;y&s;tem, the intere&s;t of &s;o|ciety in the fir&s;t in&s;tance requires the total &s;ubver|&s;ion of moral truth and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>With this view let us again recollect the maxim adopted in monarchical countries, "that the king never dies." Thus with true oriental extravagance we &s;alute this imbecil mortal, "O king, live for ever." Why do we this? Becau&s;e upon his exi&s;t|ence the exi&s;tence of the &s;tate depends. In his name the courts of law are opened. If his political capacity be &s;u&s;pended for a moment, the centre to which all public bu&s;ine&s;s is linked, is de&s;troyed. In &s;uch countries every thing is uniform: the ce|remony is all, and the &s;ub&s;tance nothing. In the riots in the year 1780, the mace of the hou&s;e of lords was propo&s;ed to be &s;ent into the pa&s;&s;ages by the terror of its appearance to quiet the confu&s;ion; but it was ob&s;erved that, if the mace &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">doly detained by the rioters, the whole would be thrown into anarchy. Bu&s;ine&s;s would be at a &s;tand, their in&s;ignia, and with their in&s;ignia their legi&s;la|tive and deliberative functions be gone. Who can
<PB N="139" REF="140">expect firmne&s;s and energy in a country, where every thing is made to depend not upon ju&s;tice, public intere&s;t and rea&s;on, but upon a piece of gilded wood? What con&s;cious dignity and virtue can there be among a people, who, if deprived of the imaginary guidance of one vulgar mortal, are taught to believe that their faculties are benumbed, and all their joints un&s;trung.</P>
<P>The evils that ari&s;e out of avarice, an inordinate admiration of wealth, and an intemperate pur&s;uit of it, are &s;o obvious, that they have con&s;tituted a perpetual topic of lamentation and complaint. The object in this place is to con&s;ider how far they are extended and aggravated by a monarchical govern|ment, that is, by a con&s;titution the very e&s;&s;ence of which is to accumulate enormous wealth upon a &s;ingle head, and to render the o&s;tentation of &s;plen|dor the cho&s;en in&s;trument for &s;ecuring honour and veneration. The object is to con&s;ider in what de|gree the luxury of courts, the effeminate &s;oftne&s;s of favourites, the &s;y&s;tem, never to be &s;eparated from the monarchical form, of putting men's ap|probation and good word at a price, of individuals buying the favour of government, and government buying the favour of individuals, is injurious to the moral improvement of mankind. As long as the unvarying practice of courts is cabal, and as long as the unvarying tendency of cabal is to bear down talents, and di&s;courage virtue, to recommend cunning in the room of &s;incerity, a &s;ervile and &s;upple di&s;po&s;ition in preference to firmne&s;s and in|flexibility, a convenient morality as better than a &s;trict one, and the &s;tudy of the red book of pro|motion rather than the &s;tudy of general welfare, &s;o long will monarchy be the bittere&s;t and mo&s;t po|tent of all the adver&s;aries of the true intere&s;ts of mankind.</P>

<P>Hence that a commonwealth, which had not fir&s;t broken her&s;elf, or been broken by &s;ome other com|monwealth, &s;hould not be found to have been conquered by the arms of any monarch, is not miraculous, but a natural effect of an apparent cau&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>ON WAR.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>[From Voltaire's Philo&s;ophical Dictionary.]</HI></HEAD>
<P>FAMINE, the plague, and war, are the three mo&s;t famous ingredients in this lower world. Under famine may be cla&s;&s;ed all the noxious foods, which want obliges us to have recour&s;e to; thus &s;hortening our life, whil&s;t we hope to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>In the plague are included all contagious di&s;tem|pers; and the&s;e are not le&s;s than two or three thou|&s;and. The&s;e two gifts we hold from providence; but war, in which all tho&s;e gifts are concentered, we owe to the fancy of three or four hundred per|&s;ons &s;cattered over the &s;urface of the globe, under the name of princes and mini&s;ters; and on this ac|count it may be, that in &s;everal dedications, they are called the living images of the Deity.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t hardened flatterer will allow, that war is ever attended with plague and famine, e&s;pecially if he has &s;een the military ho&s;pitals in Germany, or pa&s;&s;ed through any villages where &s;ome notable feat of arms has been performed.</P>
<P>It is unque&s;tionably a very noble art to ravage countries, de&s;troy dwellings, and <HI>communibus annis,</HI> out of a hundred thou&s;and men to cut off forty thou&s;and. This invention was originally cultivated by nations, a&s;&s;embled for their common good; for in&s;tance, the diet of the Greeks &s;ent word to the diet of Phrygia and its neigbours, that they were putting to &s;ea in a thou&s;and fi&s;hing-boats, in order to do their be&s;t to cut them off root and branch.</P>
<P>The Roman people, in a general a&s;&s;embly, re|&s;olved that it was their intere&s;t to go and fight the Vejentes or the Vol&s;cians before harve&s;t; and &s;ome years after, all the Romans being angry with all the Carthaginians, fought a long time both by &s;ea and land. It is otherwi&s;e in our time.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="149">A genealogi&s;t &s;ets forth to a prince that he is de&s;cended in a direct line from a count, who&s;e kindred, three or four hundred years ago, had made a family compact with a hou&s;e, the very me|mory of which is extingui&s;hed. That hou&s;e had &s;ome di&s;tant claim to a province, the la&s;t proprietor of which died of an apoplexy. The prince and his council in&s;tantly re&s;olve, that this province belongs to him by divine right. The province, which is &s;ome hundred leagues from him, prote&s;ts that it does not &s;o much as know him; that it is not di&s;po&s;ed to be governed by him; that before pre&s;cribing laws to them, their con&s;ent, at lea&s;t, was nece&s;&s;ary: the&s;e allegations do not &s;o much as reach the prince's ears; it is in&s;i&s;ted on that his right is inconte&s;table. He in&s;tantly picks up a multitude of men, who have nothing to do, nor nothing to lo&s;e; cloaths them with coar&s;e blue cloth, one &s;ou to the ell; puts them on hats bound with coar&s;e white wor&s;ted; makes them turn to the right and left; and thus marches away with them to glory.</P>
<P>Other princes on this armament, take part in it to the be&s;t of their ability, and &s;oon cover a &s;mall extent of country, with more hireling murderers than Gengis-Kan, Tamerlane, and Bajazet had at their heels.</P>
<P>People, at no &s;mall di&s;tance, on hearing that fighting is going forward, and that if they would make one, there are five or fix &s;ous a day for them, immediately divide into two bands, like reapers, and go and &s;ell their &s;ervices to the fir&s;t bidder.</P>
<P>The&s;e multitudes furiou&s;ly butcher one another, not only without having any concern in the quar|r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, but without &s;o much as knowing what it is about.</P>
<P>Sometimes five or fix powers are engaged, three again&s;t three, two again&s;t four, &s;ometimes even one
<PB N="149" REF="150">again&s;t five, all equally dete&s;ting one another; and friends and foes, by turns, agreeing only in one thing, to do all the mi&s;chief po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>An odd circum&s;tance in this infernal enterprize is, that every chief of the&s;e ruffians has his colours con&s;ecrated; and &s;olemnly prays to God before he goes to de&s;troy his neighbour. If the &s;lain in a battle do not exceed two or three thou&s;and, the for|tunate commander does not think it worth thank|ing God for; but if, be&s;ides killing ten or twelve thou&s;and men, he has been &s;o far favoured by hea|ven, as totally to de&s;troy &s;ome remarkable place, then a verbo&s;e hymn is &s;ung in four parts, com|po&s;ed in a language unknown to all the combatants, and be&s;ides &s;tuffed with barbari&s;ms<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Te Deum.</NOTE> The &s;ame &s;ong does for marriages and births, as for ma&s;&s;a|cres; which is &s;carce pardonable, e&s;pecially in a nation of all others the mo&s;t noted for new &s;ongs.</P>
<P>All countries pay a certain number of orators to celebrate the&s;e &s;anguinary actions; &s;ome in a long black coat, and over it a &s;hort docked cloak; others in a gown with a kind of &s;hirt over it; &s;ome again over their &s;hirts have two pieces of a mot|ley-coloured &s;tuff hanging down. They are all very long-winded in their harangues, and to il|lu&s;trate a battle fought in Weteravia, bring up what pa&s;&s;ed thou&s;ands of years ago in Pale&s;tine.</P>
<P>At other times the&s;e gentry declaim again&s;t vice; they prove by &s;yllogi&s;ms and antithe&s;es, that ladies, for &s;lightly heightening the hue of their cheeks with a little carmine, will a&s;&s;uredly be the eternal ob|jects of eternal vengeance; that Polyeucte and Athalia<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Two French tragedies.</NOTE> are the devil's works; that he, who&s;e table, on a day of ab&s;tinence, is loaded with fi&s;h to the amount of two hundred crowns, is infalli|bly &s;aved; and that a poor man, for eating two
<PB N="150" REF="151">penny-worth of mutton, goes to the devil for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Among five or &s;ix thou&s;and &s;uch declamations, there may be, and that is the mo&s;t, three or four, written by a Gaul named Ma&s;&s;illon, which a gen|tleman may bear to read; but in not one of all tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es has the orator the &s;pirit to animad|vert on war, that &s;courge and crime which in|cludes all others. The&s;e groveling &s;peakers are continually prating again&s;t love, mankind's only &s;olace, and the only way of repairing it: not a word do they &s;ay of the dete&s;table endeavours of the mighty for its de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Bourdaloue<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">A celebrated preacher.</NOTE> a very bad &s;ermon have you made again&s;t impurity, but not one either bad or good on tho&s;e various kinds of murders, on tho&s;e rob|beries, on tho&s;e violences, that univer&s;ally rage, by which the world is laid wa&s;te!

<HEAD>ERSKINE'S Defence of PAINE, and of the LIBERTY of the PRESS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[<HI>Continued from page</HI> 124, <HI>vol. II.</HI>]</HEAD>
<P>HIS maje&s;ty undoubtedly was not elected to the throne. No man can be &s;uppo&s;ed, in the teeth of fact, to have contended it; but did not the people of England elect King William, and break the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion? and does not his maje&s;ty's title grow out of that election? It is one of the charges again&s;t the defendant, his having denied the parliament which called the Prince of Orange to the throne to have been a legal conven|tion of the whole people; and is not the very foundation of that charge, that it was &s;uch a legal convention, and that it was intended to be &s;o? and if it was &s;o, did not the people then confer the crown upon King William without any regard to hereditary right? Did they not cut off the Prince of Wales, who &s;tood directly in the line of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, and who had incurred no per&s;onal for|feiture? Did they not give their deliverer an e&s;tate in the crown totally new and unprecedented in the law or hi&s;tory of the country? And la&s;tly, might they not, by the &s;ame authority, have given the royal inheritance to the family of a &s;tranger? Mr. Ju&s;tice Black&s;tone, in his Commentaries, in terms, a&s;&s;erts that they might; and a&s;cribes their choice of King William, and the &s;ub&s;equent limi|tations of the crown, not to the want of juri&s;dic|tion, but to their true origin, to prudence and
<PB N="153" REF="154">di&s;cretion in not di&s;turbing a valuable in&s;titution further than public &s;afety and nece&s;&s;ity dictated.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h government &s;tands thenon this pub|lic con&s;ent, the true root of all governments. And I agree with Mr. Burke, that, while it is well ad|mini&s;tered, it is not in the power of factions or libels to di&s;turb it: though when mini&s;ters are in fault, they are &s;ure to &s;et down all di&s;turbances to the&s;e cau&s;es. This is mo&s;t ju&s;tly and eloquently exemplified in the thoughts on the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent di&s;contents, page 5 and 6.</P>
<Q><P>Mini&s;ters contend that no adequate provoca|tion has been given for &s;o &s;preading a di&s;con|tent, our affairs having been conducted through|out with remarkable temper and con&s;ummate wi&s;dom. The wicked indu&s;try of &s;ome libel|lers, joined to the intrigues of a &s;ew di&s;appointed politicians, have, in their opinion, been able to produce this unnatural ferment in the nation.</P>
<P>Nothing, indeed, can be more unnatural than the pre&s;ent convul&s;ions of this country, if the above account be a true one. I confe&s;s I &s;hall a&s;&s;ent to it with great reluctance, and only on the compul&s;ion of the cleare&s;t and firme&s;t proofs; becau&s;e their account re&s;olves it&s;elf into this &s;hort but di&s;couraging propo&s;ition, 'That we have a very good mini&s;try, but that we are a very bad people;' that we &s;et our&s;elves to bite the hand that feed us; and, with a malignant in&s;anity, oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures, and ungratefully vilify the per&s;ons of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ole object is our own peace and pro&s;perity. If a few puny libellers, acting under a knot of factious politicians, with|out virtue, parts, or character (for &s;uch they are con&s;tantly repre&s;ented by the&s;e gentlemen,) are &s;ufficient to excite this di&s;turbance, very per|ver&s;e mu&s;t be the di&s;po&s;ition of that people, among&s;t whom &s;uch a di&s;turbance can be excited by &s;uch means.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155">
He &s;ays true: never were &s;erious di&s;turbances excited by &s;uch means!</P>
<P>But to return to the argument.&mdash;Let us now &s;ee how the rights of the people &s;tand upon authority, and whether this great &s;ource of government is not maintained by per&s;ons on whom my friend will find it hard to fa&s;ten the character of libellers.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with the mo&s;t modern author on the &s;ubject of government&mdash;a gentleman, who&s;e work lies &s;pread out before me, as it often does for my delight and in&s;truction in my lei&s;ure hours. I have al&s;o, by the favour of a friend who &s;its near me in court, the honour of his per&s;onal acquaintance, He is a man, perhaps more than any other, devoted to the real con&s;titution of the country, as will be found throughout his valuable work; and he is a per&s;on, be&s;ides of great learning, which enable<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him to infu&s;e much u&s;eful knowledge into my learned friend who introduced me to him. [Mr. Law, king's coun&s;el.] I &s;peak of Mr. Paley, arch|deacon of Carli&s;le, and of his work, entitled, The Principles of Political and Moral Philo&s;ophy, in which he inve&s;tigates the fir&s;t principles of all go|vernments, a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion not thought dangerous till lately; and I hope we &s;hall &s;oon get rid of this ridiculous panic.</P>
<P>Mr. Paley profe&s;&s;es to think of government what the chri&s;tian religion was thought of by its fir&s;t teachers: 'If it be of God it will &s;tand;' and he puts the duties of obedience to them upon free will and moral duty. After di&s;&s;enting from Mr. Locke as to the origin of governments in compact, he &s;ays.</P>
<Q><P>Wherefore, rejecting the intervention of a compact as unfounded in its principle, and dan|gerous in the application, we a&s;&s;ign for the only ground of the &s;ubjects obligation, THE WILL OF GOD, AS COLLECTED FROM EXPEDIENCY.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="156">The &s;teps by which the argument proceeds are few and direct. 'It is the will of God that the happine&s;s of human life be promoted;' this is the fir&s;t &s;tep, and the foundation, not only of this, but of every moral conclu&s;ion. 'Civil &s;ociety conduces to that end;' this is the &s;econd propo&s;ition, 'civil &s;ocieties cannot be upheld, unle&s;s in each, the intere&s;t of the whole &s;ociety be binding upon every part and member of it;' this is the third &s;tep, and conducts us to the conclu&s;ion, namely, 'That, &s;o long as the inte|re&s;t of the whole &s;ociety requires it (that is, &s;o long as the e&s;tabli&s;hed government cannot be re|&s;i&s;ted or changed without public inconveniency) it is the will of God (which will univer&s;ally determines our duty) that the e&s;tabli&s;hed govern|ment be obeyed,' <HI>and no longer.</HI></P>
<P>But who &s;hall judge of this? We an&s;wer, <HI>Every man for him&s;elf.'</HI> In contentions between the &s;overeign and the &s;ubject, the parties ac|knowledge no common arbitrator; and it would be ab&s;urd to commit the deci&s;ion to tho&s;e who&s;e conduct has provoked the que&s;tion, and who&s;e own intere&s;t, authority, and fate, are immedi|ately concerned in it. The danger of error and ahu&s;e is no objection to the rule of expediency, becau&s;e every other rule is liable to the &s;ame or greater; and every rule that can be propounded upon the &s;ubject (like all rules which appeal to, or bind the con&s;cience) mu&s;t, in the application depend upon private judgment. It may be ob|&s;erved, however, that it ought equally to be ac|counted the exerci&s;e of a man's private judg|ment, whether he determines by rea&s;onings and conclu&s;ions of his own, or &s;ubmits to be di|rected by the advice of others, provided he be free to choo&s;e his guide.</P></Q>
<P>He then proceeds in a manner rather incon&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="156" REF="157">with the principles entertained by my learned friend in his opening to you:</P>
<P><Q>No u&s;age, law, or authority whatever, is &s;o binding that it need or ought to be continued, when it may be changed with advantage to the community. The family of the prince&mdash;the or|der of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion&mdash;the prerogative of the crown &mdash;the form and parts of the legi&s;lature&mdash;together with the re&s;pective powers, office, duration, and mutual dependency of the &s;everal parts, are all only &s;o many laws, mutable, like other laws, whenever expediency requires, either by the ordinary act of the legi&s;lature, or, if the occa|&s;ion de&s;erve it, BY THE INTERPOSITION OF THE PEOPLE.</Q></P>
<P>No man can &s;ay that Mr. Paley intended to dif|fu&s;e di&s;content by this declaration. He mu&s;t there|fore be taken to think with me that freedom and affection, and the &s;en&s;e of advantages, are the be&s;t and the only &s;upports of government. On the &s;ame principle he then goes on to &s;ay, <Q>The&s;e points are wont to be approached with a kind of awe; they are repre&s;ented to the mind as prin|ciples of the con&s;titution, &s;ettled by our an|ce&s;tors, and being &s;ettled, to be no more com|mitted to innovation or debate; as foundations never to be &s;tirred; as the terms and conditions of the &s;ocial compact, to which every citizen of the &s;tate has engaged his fidelity, by virtue of a promi&s;e which he cannot now recall. Such rea|&s;ons have no place in our &s;y&s;tem.</Q></P>
<P>Such are the &s;entiments of this excellent author, and there is no part of Mr. Paine's work, from the one end of it to the other, that advances any other propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>But the attorney-general will &s;ay, the&s;e are the grave &s;peculative opinions of a friend to the Eng|li&s;h government, whereas Mr. Paine is its profe&s;&s;ed enemy; what then? the principle is, that every
<PB N="157" REF="158">man, while he obeys the laws, is to think for him|&s;elf, and to conduct him&s;elf as he thinks. The very ends of &s;ociety exact this licence, and the po|licy of the law, in its provi&s;ions for its &s;ecurity, has tacitly &s;anctioned it. The real fact is, that writings again&s;t a free and well-proportioned go|vernment, need not be guarded again&s;t by laws. They cannot often exi&s;t, and never with effect. The ju&s;t and awful principles of &s;ociety, are rarely brought forward, but when they are in&s;ulted or denied, or abu&s;ed in practice; Mr, Locke's E&s;&s;ay on Government, we owe to Sir Robert Filmer, as we owe Mr. Paine's to Mr. Burke; and indeed, between the arguments of Filmer and Burke, I &s;ee no e&s;&s;ential difference; &s;ince it is not worth di&s;|puting, whether a king exi&s;ts by <HI>divine</HI> right, or indi&s;&s;oluble <HI>human</HI> compact, if he exi&s;ts whether we will or no; if his exi&s;tence be without our con&s;ent, and to continue without our benefit, it matters not a farthing, whether his title be from God or from man.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>[From Voltaire's Letters.]</HI></HEAD>
<P>I WAS not at *** when your letter came; you embarra&s;s me greatly; I &s;hall only an&s;wer you for the plea&s;ure of entertaining my&s;elf with a man who is much better able to re&s;olve the doubts which he propo&s;ed, than the per&s;on to whom he &s;ent them.</P>
<P>I am not of your opinion with regard to de&s;po|ti&s;m and de&s;potic princes. It appears to me horri|ble and ab&s;urd to the la&s;t degree, that a whole peo|ple
<PB N="158" REF="159">&s;hould blindly &s;ubject them&s;elves to the caprice of one, even if he were an angel. For my own part, I would not live under him a &s;ingle day. This angel may become in a moment a mon&s;ter, thir&s;ting after blood. De&s;poti&s;m is to me the mo&s;t abominable and di&s;gu&s;tful of all bad governments; man is perpetually cru&s;hed, deba&s;ed, and degraded by it. Look into hi&s;tory, ancient and modern, if ever there was one upon earth that was not an in|&s;ult on mankind, and the di&s;grace of human na|ture. Monarchy would doubtle&s;s be the be&s;t of governments, if it was po&s;&s;ible to find &s;uch kings as Henry IV, the only one who ever de&s;erved the homage and veneration of his &s;ubjects. Kings &s;hould always be brought up in the &s;chool of afflic|tion, as this great man was; &s;uch alone are truly great, and the lovers of mankind. Before we can feel for the misfortunes of others, we mu&s;t our|&s;elves have been unfortunate. But on the other hand, the hearts of princes, corrupted by pro&s;pe|rity, and the &s;laves of pride and folly, are inac|ce&s;&s;ible to pity, and in&s;en&s;ible to true glory.</P>
<P>I am not at all &s;urprized, that in monarchies, and e&s;pecially in our own, there &s;hould be &s;o few princes worthy of e&s;teem. Incircled by corrupters, knaves, and hypocrites, they accu&s;tom them&s;elves to look upon their fellow-creatures with di&s;dain, and &s;et no value on any but the &s;ycophants, who care&s;s their vices and live in perpetual idlene&s;s and inactivity. Such is generally the condition of a monarch; great men are always &s;carce, and great kings &s;till more &s;o. Add to this, that the &s;plendor of a monarchy is &s;hort and tran&s;itory. France is al|ready &s;unk into mi&s;ery and di&s;grace; an age more will annihilate her, or &s;he will fall a prey to the fir&s;t intrepid conqueror.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h government has nothing to &s;upport it but a delu&s;ive out&s;ide, extremely flattering to the people, who fancy them&s;elves the &s;ole go|vernors.
<PB N="159" REF="160">I do not know any country where it is more ea&s;y to create &s;uch open di&s;&s;entions as may overthrow the &s;tate. A man of &s;en&s;e and gene|ro&s;ity may, in ten years time, erect him&s;elf into a de&s;potic prince with more &s;afety at London than at Mo&s;cow: Remember Crom well. Money alone is &s;ufficient to corrupt the whole parliament.</P>
<P>The great, ever fond of riches and power, and pro&s;trate at the feet of fortune, who always attend the throne, will promote the views of their ma&s;ter; and the great, once gained over, this phantom of liberty, which appears at intervals in the convul|&s;ive motions of the commons, which awakens, &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es it&s;elf, and &s;oon vani&s;hes, will be totally an|nihilated at the fir&s;t &s;ignal given by the Supreme Ruler.</P>
<P>I know indeed of no monarchy that is fixed, con&s;tant and perfect; the wi&s;e&s;t kings oppre&s;s their &s;ubjects to arrive at de&s;poti&s;m. Adieu, my friend; live in freedom and ob&s;curity. Solitude will procure you the be&s;t and true&s;t plea&s;ure, &s;elf-content. The fooli&s;h and the wicked &s;een far off, will only excite your compa&s;&s;ion; to look nearly upon them, would rai&s;e your contempt and indig|nation.</P>

<P>Sir, it is well known we are a trading nation, and con&s;equently cannot thrive in a bargain where nothing is to be gained. The poor electors, who run from their &s;hops, or the plough, for the &s;er|vice of their country, are they not to be con&s;idered for their labour and their loyalty? The candidates, who, with the hazard of their per&s;ons, the lo&s;s of their characters, and the ruin of their fortunes, are preferred to the &s;enate, in a country where they are &s;trangers, before the very lords of the &s;oil; are they not to be rewarded for their zeal to your ma|je&s;ty's &s;ervice, and qualified to live in your metro|polis as becomes the lu&s;tre of their &s;tations.</P>
<P>Sir, if I have given great numbers of the mo&s;t profitable employments among my own relations and neare&s;t allies, it was not out of any partiality, but becau&s;e I know them be&s;t, and can be&s;t depend upon them. I have been at the pains to mould and cultivate their opinions. Abler heads might pro|bably have been found, but they would not be equally under my direction. A hunt&s;man, who hath the ab&s;olute command of his dogs, will hunt more effectually than with a better pack, to who&s;e manner and cry he is a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>Sir, upon the whole, I will appeal to all tho&s;e who be&s;t knew your royal father, whether that

Under any &s;tate of &s;ociety, pro|perty always has had, and will have, full as much influence as it ought; and it is gro&s;s ignorance in politics, to and &s;o many artificial to the natural inequalities among men.

His family, mean while, who look up to him for comfort and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, igno|rant of his misfortune, are anxiou&s;ly expecting his wonted return; perhaps their homely repa&s;t for the night depended on his earnings for the day: but his u&s;ual hour of return to his family is gone by; each pa&s;&s;ing foot&s;tep, each noi&s;e of di&s;tant &s;imilarity, is eagerly li&s;tened to in vain: Hope &s;till draws out the lengthened evening, till a &s;leeple&s;s night of lamentation and de&s;pair &s;ucceeds the dreary melancholy hours of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive di&s;appointment and fruitle&s;s expectation.

Why not double the pay?&mdash;Why not?&mdash;Becau&s;e the over-grown fortunes of the rich land-holders, the monopolizers of wa&s;tes and commons, would ex|perience an almo&s;t imperceptible diminution. While, by the good old fa&s;hion of dragging away the poor, by means of a pre&s;s-gang, no taxes are laid upon the wealthy; and a due portion of the Swini&s;h multitude, the &s;cum of the earth, are pe|riodically &s;wept away as food for powder.</P>
<P>Such are &s;ome among the numerous hard&s;hips of which the Briti&s;h poor have too much rea&s;on to complain. Indigence, one would think, is of it|&s;elf a &s;ufficient evil to an inhabitant of &s;ociety, without being held out as a reproach, or converted into a crime. Why then &s;hould &s;lavery be added to poverty, and the rights of man be emerged in the misfortunes of the citizen? A citizen, indeed, is an improper appellation; the poor man is not a citizen: for being denied, <HI>even by the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution,</HI> the privilege of repre&s;entation, he is &s;ubjected to the will of tho&s;e who make, and the power of tho&s;e who execute the laws; and he is at be&s;t but an inhabitant of his native land, for the benefit of his richer neighbour.</P>
<P>Hence I cannot help regarding any &s;cheme of reform as in&s;ignificant, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it, which &s;hall not include in the &s;cheme it&s;elf (without tru&s;t|ing to di&s;tant promi&s;es and fair profe&s;&s;ions) &s;ome effectual means of rai&s;ing and meliorating the con|dition of what are called the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people. <HI>Patriots</HI> (as Dr. John&s;on very &s;hrewdly
<PB N="171" REF="172">and &s;arca&s;tically remarked) <HI>are fond of levelling down to them&s;elves, but they &s;eldom propo&s;e to level up to them|&s;elves.</HI> It is fit that this reproach &s;hould be done away from the advocates of a good cau&s;e. It is the people, the lower cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, that con&s;titute the bulk of mankind, that form the great ma&s;s of capability, and pre&s;ent to the politician the mo&s;t important object of national improvement. For my own part, I care little in compari&s;on for a re|form that &s;hall &s;erve merely to dimini&s;h the taxes paid by the rich, or gratify the wi&s;hes of &s;enatorial orators or would-be &s;tate&s;men, whether in or out of parliament. Away with &s;uch half-mea&s;ured re|formers&mdash;men of rank and re&s;pectability, as they &s;ometimes call them&s;elves; who de&s;ire no farther reform than to extend the ari&s;tocratic monopoly of power to that circle in which them&s;elves are in|cluded; who make the people the &s;talking-hor&s;e to their de&s;igns, and the &s;tep-ladder to the official &s;ituations which they a&s;pire to obtain; who have temperance and moderation in their mouths, and pride and ambition in their hearts; and who rai&s;e the hue and cry of violence, innovation, and re|publicani&s;m, again&s;t every man who looks beyond the petty intere&s;ts of a party, or includes in his notions of patrioti&s;m a de&s;ire to promote not the privileges of a corporation, but the rights of man.</P>
<P>Hence, al&s;o, it is to me no matter of &s;urprize that the people, the multitude, feel no intere&s;t in the repeated outcries for parliamentary reform, when the evils they feel are hardly touched upon, and advantages held out which they have no am|bition to enjoy. Who has yet talked of dividing the wa&s;tes and the commons&mdash;of aboli&s;hing tythes&mdash;of rewarding population&mdash;of comfortably pro|viding for the old age of the labourer, the manus facturer, the artificer&mdash;of exonerating the poor from the indirect taxes which they pay without
<PB N="172" REF="173">knowing it; as well as from the direct impo&s;ition, which mini&s;ters &s;ecretly lay on&mdash;and above all of providing ample means of PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, that the poor man may know what his rights are, and what is the object of government, and what are the duties of the &s;ervants of the people. That he may become if he chu&s;es a human creature, and not a machine; and having the capacity of mental improvement given to him by his Maker, that he may me as he ought the talent thus committed to his care. Why &s;hould the truth be concealed? There is among us too much inequality of rank&mdash;too much inequality of riches&mdash;too much inequa|lity of labour. The poor work too much, and know too little: ince&s;&s;ant labour &s;tupifies the mental fa|culties, and produces an inclination to &s;atisfy the cravings of nature beyond the nece&s;&s;ities of nature. Hence the amu&s;ements of the poor are gro&s;s; their hours of relaxation intemperate, and habits of drunkenne&s;s and expence are in&s;en&s;ibly formed, till the whole man is degraded, and ignorance and poverty linked with him as companions for life. I wi&s;h it were not true that the&s;e habits are rather encouraged than &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, that nine tenths of the nation may be mere machines to execute the la|bour, of which the other tenth enjoys the profit.</P>
<P>My notions then of an effectual reform in the repre&s;entation of the people would take in the whole of that ari&s;tocratical apo&s;tate the Duke of Richmond's idea, in his Letter to Colonel Sharman. I would have the man, who&s;e &s;take in the commu|nity con&s;i&s;ts of life, and liberty, and labour, with a penny in his pocket, to have an equal voice in the choice of legi&s;lators, by who&s;e laws that &s;take is to be protected, with another man who has life, and liberty, and labour, with a hundred thou&s;and pounds in his pocket.

<P>AS liberty can never &s;ub&s;i&s;t without equality, nor equality be long pre&s;erved without an <HI>Agrarian</HI> law, or &s;omething like it; &s;o when men's riches are become immea&s;urably or &s;urprizingly great, a people, who regard their own &s;ecurity, ought to make a &s;trict enquiry how they came by them, and oblige them to take down their own &s;ize, for fear of terrifying the community, or ma&s;tering it. In every country and under every government, particular men may be too rich.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Romans</HI> had well ob&s;erved the <HI>Agrarian</HI> law, by which the extent of every citizen's e&s;tate was a&s;certained, &s;ome citizens could never have ri&s;en &s;o high as they did above others; and con|&s;equently, one man could never have been &s;et above all the re&s;t, and have e&s;tabli&s;hed, as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> did at la&s;t, a tyranny in that great and glorious &s;tate.

<P>But, will &s;ome &s;ay, is it a crime to be rich? Yes, certainly, at the public expence, or to the danger of the public. A man may be too rich for a &s;ubject; even the revenues of kings may be too
<PB N="174" REF="175">large. It is one of the effects of arbitrary power, that the prince has too much, and the people too little; and &s;uch inequality may be the cau&s;e too of arbitrary power.

<P>GOVERNMENT is an in&s;titution for the be|nefit of the people governed, which they have power to model as they plea&s;e; and to &s;ay, that they can have too much of this power, is to &s;ay, that there ought to be a power in the &s;tate &s;u|perior to that which gives it Being, and from which all juri&s;diction in it is derived. Licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, which has been commonly mentioned, as an extreme of liberty, is indeed its oppo&s;ite. It is government by the will of rapacious individuals in oppo&s;ition to the will of the community, made known and declared in the laws. A free &s;tate, at the &s;ame time that it is free it&s;elf, makes all its members free by excluding licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and guarding their per&s;ons and property and good name again&s;t in&s;ult. It is the end of all ju&s;t govern|ment, at the &s;ame time that it &s;ecures the liberty of the public again&s;t <HI>foreign</HI> injury, to &s;ecure the liberty of the individual again&s;t <HI>private</HI> injury. I do not, therefore, think it &s;trictly ju&s;t to &s;ay, that it belongs to the nature of government to entrench on private liberty. It ought never to do this, ex|cept as far as the exerci&s;e of private liberty en|croaches on the liberties of others. That is; it is licentiou&s;ne&s;s it re&s;trains, and liberty it&s;elf only when u&s;ed to de&s;troy liberty.</P>
<P>It appears from hence, that licentiou&s;ne&s;s and de&s;poti&s;m are more nearly allied than is commonly imagined. They are both alike incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty, and the true end of government; nor is there any other difference between them, than that the one is the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>great</HI> men, and the other the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>little</HI> men; or that, by the one, the per&s;ons and property of a people are

But all well con|&s;tituted governments guard equally again&s;t both. Indeed of the two, the la&s;t is, on &s;everal accounts, the lea&s;t to be dreaded, and has done the lea&s;t mi&s;|chief. It may be truly &s;aid, that if licentiou&s;ne&s;s has de&s;troyed its thou&s;ands, de&s;poti&s;m has de|&s;troyed its millions.

<HEAD>ERSKINE's DEFENCE OF PAINE, AND THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">(<HI>Conninued from Page</HI> 157, vol. 2.)</HEAD>
<P>THAT his [i. e. the kings] title is from man, and from every generation of man, without regard to the determination of former ones, hear from Mr. Locke, <HI>"All men"</HI> &s;ay they, (i. e. Filmer and his adherents,) <Q><HI>are born under government, and therefore they cannot be at liberty to begin a new one. Every one is born a &s;ubject to his father, or his prince, and is therefore under the perpetual tie of &s;ubjection and allegiance."</HI> But it is plain, mankind never owned nor con&s;idered any &s;uch natural <HI>&s;ubjection that they were born in,</HI> to one or to the other, that tied them, without their own con|&s;ents, to a &s;ubjection to them and their heirs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is true, that whatever engagements or pro|mi&s;es any one has made for him&s;elf, he is under the obligation of them, but cannot, by any com|pact what&s;oever, bind his children or po&s;terity; for his &s;on, when a man, being altogether as free as his father, <HI>any act of the father can no more give away the liberty of the &s;on, than it can of any body el&s;e.</HI></Q></P>
<P>So much for Mr. Locke's opinion of the Rights of Mankind. Let us now examine his ideas of the &s;uppo&s;ed danger of tru&s;ting them with them.</P>
<P><Q>Perhaps it will be &s;aid, that the people being ignorant, and always di&s;contented, to lay the foundation of government in the un&s;teady opi|nion and uncertain humour of the people, is to expo&s;e it to certain ruin; and no government will be able long to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, if the people may &s;et up a new legi&s;lature, whenever they take offence at the old one. To this, I an&s;wer quite the contrary: People are not &s;o ea&s;ily got out of their old forms, as &s;ome are apt to &s;ugge&s;t; they
<PB N="179" REF="180">are hardly to be prevailed with to amend the ac|knowledged faults in the frame they have been accu&s;tomed to; and if there be any original de|fects, or adventitious ones introduced by time, or corruption, it is not an ea&s;y thing to be changed, even when all the world &s;ees there is an oppor|tunity for it. This &s;lowne&s;s and aver&s;ion in the people to quit their old Con&s;titutions, has in the many revolutions which have been &s;een in this kingdom, in this and former ages, &s;till kept us to, or after &s;ome interval of fruitle&s;s attempts, &s;till brought us back again to our old legi&s;lative of kings, lords, and commons; and whatever provocations have made the crown be taken from &s;ome of our princes heads, they never carried the people &s;o far as to place it in another line.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, I wi&s;h I had &s;trength to go on with all that is material, but I have read enough, not only to maintain the true principles of government, but to put to &s;hame the narrow &s;y&s;tem of di&s;tru&s;t|ing the people.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that Mr. Locke went great lengths in his po&s;itions, to beat down the contrary doctrine of divine right, which was then endan|gering the new e&s;tabli&s;hment. But that cannot be objected to Mr. David Hume, who maintains the &s;ame doctrine; &s;peaking of the Magna Charta in his hi&s;tory, vol. 2. Page 88, he &s;ays, <Q>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the former articles of the great Charter, contain &s;uch mitigations and explana|tions of the feudal law, as are rea&s;onable and equitable; and that the latter involve all the chief outlines of a legal government, and pro|vide for the equal di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice and free enjoyment of property; the great object for which political &s;ociety was founded by men, <HI>which the people have a perpetual and unalienable right to recall;</HI> and which no time, nor precedent, nor &s;tatute, nor po&s;itive in&s;titution, ought to
<PB N="180" REF="181">deter from keeping ever uppermo&s;t in their thoughts and attention.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e authorities are &s;ufficient to re&s;t on, yet I cannot omit Mr. Burke him&s;elf, who is, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more di&s;tinct on the &s;ubject, &s;peaking not of the ancient people of England, but of colonies planted almo&s;t within our memories, he &s;ays, <Q>If there he one fact in the world perfectly clear, it is this; that the di&s;po&s;ition of the people of America, is wholly aver&s;e to any other than a free government, and this is indication enough to any hone&s;t &s;tate&s;man, how he ought to adapt whatever power he finds in his hands to their ca&s;e. If any a&s;k me what a free government is, I an&s;wer, THAT IT IS WHAT THE PEOPLE THINK SO; AND THAT THEY, AND NOT I, ARE THE NATURAL, LAWFUL AND COMPE|TENT JUDGES OF THIS MATTER. If they prac|tically allow me a greater degree of authority over them than is con&s;i&s;tent with any correct ideas of perfect freedom, I ought to thank them for &s;o great a tru&s;t, and not to endeavour to prove from thence, that they have rea&s;oned ami&s;s, and that having gone &s;o far, by analogy, they mu&s;t hereafter have no enjoyment but by my plea|&s;ure.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am &s;orry to feel my time con&s;ider|ably con&s;umed, before I am arrived at what I con|ceive to be the material &s;ubject of your con&s;idera|tion. For all that I have been &s;tating now, is only to &s;hew, that there is not that novelty in the opinions of the defendant, that &s;hould lead you to think that he does not <HI>bona &s;ide</HI> entertain them, much le&s;s when connected with the hi&s;tory of his life, which I therefore brought in review before you&mdash;But &s;till the great que&s;tion remains unargued: Had he a right to promulgate the&s;e opinions? Gentlemen, if he entertained them, I &s;hall argue that he had&mdash;And although my arguments upon
<PB N="181" REF="182">the Liberty of the Pre&s;s, may not to day be honour|ed with your, or the court's approbation, I &s;hall retire not at all di&s;heartened, con&s;oling my&s;elf with the reflection, that a &s;ea&s;on may arrive for their reception.&mdash;The mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential freedoms of man|kind have been but &s;lowly and gradually received, and &s;o very late, indeed, do &s;ome of them come to maturity, that not with&s;tanding the attorney-gene|ral tells you that the very que&s;tion I am now agi|tating, is mo&s;t peculiarly for <HI>your</HI> con&s;ideration, AS A JURY, under our ANCIENT con&s;titution, yet I mu&s;t remind both you and him, that your juri&s;|diction to con&s;ider and deal with it at all in judg|ment, is but A YEAR OLD.&mdash;When before that late period, I ventured to maintain this very RIGHT OF A JURY, over the que&s;tion of libel under the &s;ame <HI>ancient</HI> con&s;titution. (I do not mean before my lord, for the matter was gone to re&s;t in the courts, at lea&s;t long before he came to &s;it where he does.) But when before a noble and reverend ma|gi&s;trate of the mo&s;t exalted under&s;tanding, and of the mo&s;t uncorrupted integrity, to give effect to it, I had occa&s;ion to maintain it, he treated me, not with di&s;regard, indeed, for of that his nature was incapable; but he put me a&s;ide with indul|gence, as you do a child while it is li&s;ping its prat|tle out of &s;ea&s;on: and if this had been tried then, in&s;tead of now, the defendant mu&s;t have been in|&s;tantly convicted on the proof of the publication, whatever <HI>you</HI> might have thought of his ca&s;e.&mdash;Yet, I have lived to &s;ee it re&s;olved, by an almo&s;t una|nimous vote of the whole Parliament of England, that I had all along been in the right. If this be not an awful le&s;&s;on of caution concerning opini|ons, where are &s;uch le&s;&s;ons to be read!</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have in&s;i&s;ted, at great length, upon the origin of government, being in the con&s;ent of the people, and detailed the authorities which you have heard upon the &s;ubject, becau&s;e I con&s;ider it to be not only a &s;upport, but, indeed, the only foundation of the liberty of the pre&s;s. If Mr.
<PB N="182" REF="183">Burke be right in HIS principles of government, I admit that the pre&s;s, in my &s;ence of its Freedom, ought not to be free, <HI>nor free in any &s;en&s;e at all;</HI> and that all addre&s;&s;es to the people upon the &s;ub|ject of government, and all &s;peculations of amend|ment, of what kind or nature &s;oever, are illegal and criminal:&mdash;For, if the people have, without po&s;&s;ible recall, delegated all their authorities, they have no juri&s;diction to act and therefore none to think, upon &s;uch &s;ubjects, and it is a libel to arraign government or any of its acts, before tho&s;e that have no juri&s;diction to correct them. But on the other hand, as it is a &s;ettled rule in the law of England, that the &s;ubject may always addre&s;s a competent juri&s;|diction on every matter within it, no legal argument can &s;hake the freedom of the pre&s;s in any &s;en&s;e of it, if I am &s;upporaed in my doctrines concerning the great unalienable rights of the people, to change or reform their government.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is becau&s;e the Liberty of the Pre&s;s re&s;olves it&s;elf into this great i&s;&s;ue, that it has been in every time and country, the la&s;t liberty which &s;ubjects have been able to wre&s;t from power.&mdash; Other liberties are held under governments, but the liberty of opinion keeps governments them|&s;elves in due &s;ubjection to their duties. This has produced the martyrdom of truth in every age, and <HI>the world has only purged it&s;elf from ignorance with the innocent blood of tho&s;e who have enlightened it.</HI></P>
<P>Gentlemen, my &s;trength and time are wa&s;ted, and I can only make this melancholy hi&s;tory pa&s;s like a &s;hadow before you.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with the grand type and example.</P>

<HEAD>The probable Influence of the French Revolution on the Liberties of Europe.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From a Letter to</HI> Mr. Pitt, <HI>on his Apo&s;tacy from the cau&s;e of Parliamentary Reform.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOTHING indeed can be more evident, than that a mighty change in the direction of the public &s;entiments of Europe, is likely to ari&s;e from that revolution, whether it be &s;ucce&s;sful or un|&s;ucce&s;sful. If it be &s;ucce&s;sful, the &s;pirit of extreme democracy, is likely to &s;pread over all Europe, and to &s;wallow up in a volcanic eruption, every rem|nant of monarchy and of nobility in the civilized world. The probability of &s;uch effects is &s;o &s;trong|ly believed by the enemies of that revolution, that it is the ground of their alarm, the &s;ubject of their invective, and the pretext of their ho&s;tilities. It
<PB N="185" REF="186">was to prevent &s;uch con&s;equences, that Mr. Burke &s;o benevolently coun&s;elled the princes of Europe to undertake that <HI>cru&s;ade</HI> in which they are now &s;o piou&s;ly engaged.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, the efforts of France be un&s;ucce&s;sful; if her liberties be de&s;troyed, there can be little doubt that &s;uch a &s;hock will mo&s;t pow|erfully impel the current of opinion to the &s;ide of monarchy: a direction in which it will be likely for &s;everal ages to continue. The example of the de&s;truction of the great French Republic would diffu&s;e, di&s;may, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion among a multi|tude, who only judge by events; and the bloody &s;cenes which mu&s;t attend &s;uch a de&s;truction, would indeed be &s;ufficient to appal the &s;terne&s;t and mo&s;t ardent champions of liberty.

The royal confederacy which had effected this &s;ubver|&s;ion, would doubtle&s;s continue its concert and its efforts. The principle of maintaining the inter|nal independence of nations, being de&s;troyed by the example of France, no barrier would any long|er be oppo&s;ed to the arbitrary will of kings.

<HEAD>ON KINGS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From</HI> Godwin's <HI>Enquiry concerning Political justice</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Continued</HI> from Page 139, vol. 2. OF LIMITED MONARCHY.</HEAD>
<P>I PROCEED to con&s;ider monarchy, not as it exi&s;ts in countries where it is unlimited and de&s;potic, but, as in certain in&s;tances it has appear|ed, a branch merely of the general con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Here it is only nece&s;&s;ary to recollect the objec|tions which applied to it in its unqualified &s;tate, in order to perceive that they bear upon it with the &s;ame explicitne&s;s, if not with great force, un|der every po&s;&s;ible modification. Still the go|vernment is founded in fal&s;ehood, affirming that a certain individual is eminently qualified for an important &s;ituation, who&s;e qualifications are per|haps &s;carcely &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the meane&s;t member of the community. Still the government is founded in inju&s;tice, becau&s;e it rai&s;es one man for a permanent duration over the heads of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t
<PB N="189" REF="190">of the community, not for any moral recommenda|tion he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, but arbitrarily and by accident. Still it reads a con&s;tant and powerful le&s;&s;on of immorality, to the people at large, or exhibiting pomp and &s;plendour, and magnificence, in&s;tead of virtue, as the index to general veneration and e&s;teem. The individual is, not le&s;s than in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute monarchy, unfited by his education to become either re&s;pectable or u&s;eful. He is un|ju&s;tly and cruelly placed in a &s;ituation that engen|ders ignorance, weakne&s;s and pre&s;umption, after having been &s;tripped in his infancy, of all the ener|gies that &s;hould defend him again&s;t the inro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds of the&s;e adver&s;aries. Finally, his exi&s;tence implies that of a train of courtiers and a &s;eries of intrigue, of &s;ervility, &s;ecret influence, capricious partialities and pecuniary corruption. So true is the ob&s;erva|tion of Monte&s;quieu, that "we mu&s;t not expect under a monarchy to find the people virtuous."</P>
<P>But if we con&s;ider the que&s;tion more narrowly, we &s;hall perhaps find, that unlimited monarchy has other ab&s;urdities and vices which are peculiarly its own. In an ab&s;olute &s;overeignty, the king may if he p&s;ea&s;e be his own mini&s;ter, but in a limited one a mini&s;try and a cabinet are e&s;&s;ential parts of the con&s;titution. In an ab&s;olute &s;overeignty, princes are acknowledged to be re&s;pon&s;ible only to God; but in a limited one there is a re&s;pon&s;ibility of a very different nature. In a limited monarchy there are checks, one branch of the government coun|teracting the exce&s;&s;es of another, and a check without re&s;pon&s;ibility, is the mo&s;t flagrant of all contradictions.</P>
<P>It was a confu&s;ed feeling of the&s;e truths, that in|trodueed into limited monarchies, the principle "that the king can do no wrong<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, is a maxim of the Engli&s;h law; but, whatever meaning it may have, the examples of Edward II. Richard II. Charles I. and James II. &s;ufficiently prove that the kings of England are neither incapable of doing wrong nor exempt from being puni&s;hed for it. Note added by one of the Swini&s;h Mul|titude.</NOTE>". Ob&s;erve
<PB N="190" REF="191">the peculiar con&s;i&s;tency of this proceeding. Con|&s;ider what a &s;pecimen it affords us of plain dealing, frankne&s;s and unalterable &s;incerity. An indivi|dual is fir&s;t appointed, and endowed with the mo&s;t momentous prerogatives, and then it is pretend|ed that, not he, but other men are an&s;werable for the abu&s;e of the&s;e prerogatives. This pretence may appear tolerable to men bred among the ficti|ons of law, but justice, truth and virtue revolt from it with indignation.</P>
<P>Having first invented this fiction, it becomes the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch constitutions as nearly as po&s;|&s;ible to reali&s;e it. A ministry must be regularly formed; they must concert together; and the mea&s;ures they execute must originate in their own di&s;cretion. The king mu&s;t be reduced as nearly as po&s;&s;ible to a cypher, So far as he fails to be completely &s;o, the constitution must be imperfect.</P>
<P>What &s;ort of a figure is it that this mi&s;erable wretch exhibits in the face of the world? Every thing is with great parade tran&s;acted in his name. He a&s;&s;umes all the inflated and oriental style which has been already de&s;cribed, and which indeed was upon that occa&s;ion tran&s;cribed from the practice of a limited monarchy. We find him like Pharaoh's frogs "in our hou&s;es and upon our beds, in our ovens, and our kneading troughs."</P>
<P>Now ob&s;erve the man him&s;elf to whom all this importance is annexed. To be idle is the ab&s;tract of all his duties. He is paid an immen&s;e revenue only to dance and to eat, to wear a &s;carlet robe and a crown. He may not choo&s;e any one of his mea&s;ures. He mu&s;t li&s;ten with docility to the con&s;ultations of his mini&s;ters, and &s;anction with a ready a&s;&s;ent whatever they determine. He mu&s;t not hear any other advi&s;ers for they are his known and con&s;titutional coun&s;ellors. He mu&s;t not ex|pre&s;s to any man his opinion, for that would be a &s;ini&s;ter and uncon&s;titutional interference.
<PB N="191" REF="192">To be ab&s;olutely perfect he mu&s;t have no opinion, but be the vacant and colourie&s;s mirror, by which theirs is reflected. He &s;peaks, for they have taught him what he &s;hould &s;ay; he affixes his &s;ignature, for they inform him that it is nece&s;&s;ary and proper.</P>
<P>A limited monarchy in the articles I have de|&s;cribed, might be executed with great facility and applau&s;e, if a king were what &s;uch a con&s;titution endeavours to render him, a mere puppet, regu|lated by pullies and wires<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such a monarch has been projected; and as the &s;cheme may po&s;&s;ibly plea&s;e the pigs, is will follow this extract.</NOTE>. But it is perhaps the mo&s;t egregious and palpable of all political mi&s;takes to imagine that we can reduce a human being to this &s;tate of neutrality and torpor. He will not exert any u&s;eful and true activity, but he will be far from pa&s;&s;ive. The more he is excluded from that energy, that characteri&s;es wi&s;dom and virtue, the more depraved and unrea&s;onable will he be in this caprices. Is any promotion vacant, and do we expect that he will never think of bestowing it on a favourite, or of proving by an occa&s;ional election of his own, that he really exists? This promotion may happen to be of the utmost importance to the public welfare; or, if not; every promotion un|meritedly given is pernicious to national virtue, and an upright minister will refu&s;e to a&s;&s;ent to it. A king does not fail to hear his power and prero|gatives extolled, and he will no doubt at &s;ome time wi&s;h to e&s;&s;ay their reality in an unprovoked war against a foreign nation or against his own citizens.</P>
<P>Such then is the genuine and uncontrovertible &s;cene of a mixed monarchy. An individual placed at the &s;ummit of the edifice, the centre and the fountain of honour, and who is neutral, or mu&s;t &s;eem neutral in the current tran&s;actions of his go|vernment. This is the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on of honour, vir|tue and truth, which mixed monarchy reads to its &s;ubjects. Next to the king come his admini|&s;tration
<PB N="192" REF="193">and the tribe of courtiers; men driven by a fatal nece&s;&s;ity, to be corrupt, intriguing and venal; &s;ciected for their tru&s;t by the mo&s;t ignorant and ill-informed of their countrymen; made &s;olely accountable for mea&s;ures of which they cannot &s;olely be the authors; threatened, if di&s;hone&s;t, with the vengeance of an injured people; and, if hone&s;t, with the &s;urer vengeance of their &s;ove|reign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s di&s;plea&s;ure. The re&s;t of the nation, the &s;ubjects at large.</P>
<P>Was ever a name &s;o fraught with degradation and meanne&s;s as this of &s;ubjects? I am, it &s;eem, by the very place of my birth, become a &s;ubject. Of what, or whom? Can an hone&s;t man con&s;ider him&s;elf as the &s;ubject of any thing but the laws of ju&s;tice? Can he acknowledge a &s;uperior, or hold him&s;elf bound to &s;ubmit his judgment to the will of another, not le&s;s liable than him&s;elf to prejudice and error? Such is the idol that monarchy wor|&s;hips in lieu of the divinity of truth and the &s;acred obligation of public good. It is of little con&s;e|quence whether we vow fidelity to the king and the nation, or to the nation and the king, &s;o long as the king intrudes him&s;elf to tarni&s;h and under|mine the true &s;implicity, the altar of virtue.</P>
<P>Are mere names beneath our notice, and will they produce no &s;ini&s;ter influence upon the mind? May we bend the knee before the &s;hrine of vanity and folly without injury? Far otherwi&s;e. Mind had its beginning in &s;en&s;ation, and it depends upon words and &s;ymbols for the progre&s;s of its a&s;&s;ocia|tions. The true good man must not only have a heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;olved, but a front erect. We cannot practi&s;e objection, hypocri&s;y and meanne&s;s, without be|coming degraded in other men's eyes and in our own. We cannot "bow the head in the temple of Rimmon," without in &s;ome degree apo&s;tati&s;ing from the divinity of truth. He that calls a king a man, will perpetually hear from his own mouth the
<PB N="193" REF="194">le&s;&s;on that he is unfit for the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him he that calls him by any &s;ublimer appellation, is ha&s;tening fa&s;t into the mo&s;t palpable and dangerous errors.</P>
<P>But perhaps "mankind are &s;o weak and imbe|cile, that it is in vain to expect from the change of their in&s;titutions the improvement of their charac|ter." Who made them weak and imbecile? Pre|viou&s;ly to human in&s;titutions they had certainly none of this defect. Man con&s;idered in him&s;elf is merely a being capable of impre&s;&s;ion, a recipient of perceptions. What is there in this ab&s;tract cha|racter that precludes him from advancement? We have a faint di&s;covery in individuals at pre&s;ent of what our nature is capable: why &s;hould individuals be fit for &s;o much, and the &s;pecies for nothing? Is there any thing in the &s;tructure of the globe that forbids us to be virtuous? If not, if nearly all our impre&s;&s;ions of right and wrong flow from our intercour&s;e with each other, why may not that in|tercour&s;e be &s;u&s;ceptible of modification and amend|ment? It is the mo&s;t cowardly of all &s;y&s;tems that would repre&s;ent the di&s;covery of truth as u&s;ele&s;s, and teach us that, when di&s;covered, it is our wi&s;|dom to leave the ma&s;s of our &s;pecies in error.</P>
<P>There is not in reality the &s;malle&s;t room for &s;ceptici&s;m re&s;pecting the omnipotence of truth. Truth is the pebble in the lake; and however &s;lowly in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e the circles &s;ucceed each other, they will infallibly go on till they over|&s;pread the &s;urface. No order of mankind will for ever remain ignorant of the principles of ju&s;tice, equality and public good. No &s;ooner will they un|der&s;tand them, than they will perceive the coinci|dence of virtue and public good with private in|tere&s;t: nor will any erroneous e&s;tabli&s;hment beable effectually to &s;upport it&s;elf again&s;t general opinion. In this conte&s;t &s;ophi&s;try will vani&s;h, and mi&s;chie|rous in&s;titutions &s;ink quietly into neglect. Truth
<PB N="194" REF="195">will bring down all her forces, mankind will be her army, and oppre&s;&s;ion, inju&s;tice, monarchy and vice will tumble into a common ruin.</P>
<P>Let us beware by an unju&s;tifiable perver&s;ion of terms of confounding the common under&s;tanding of mankind. A king is the well known and &s;tand|ing appellation for an office, which, if there be any truth in the arguments of the preceding chap|ters, has been the bane and the grave of human virtue. Why endeavour to purify and exorci&s;e what is entitled only to execration? why not &s;uf|fer the term to be as well under&s;tood and as cordi|ally dete&s;ted as the once honourable appellation of tyrant, afterwards was among the Greeks? Why not &s;uffer it to re&s;t a perpetual monument of the folly, the cowardice and mi&s;ery of our &s;pecies?</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>(Suppo&s;ed to be written by the late Henry Fielding E&s;q.)</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF I were a Cor&s;ican, I &s;hould certainly be a re|bel; that is, I &s;hould hazard my life and e&s;tate to recover my liberty; but if after all I mu&s;t &s;ub|mit to be a &s;lave, I would be a &s;lave to Baron Nieuhoff<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Theodore Baron Nieuhoff, elected King of Corfica.</NOTE>, or even to a Ru&s;&s;ian Bojar, rather than to my old ta&s;k ma&s;ters of Genoa.</P>
<P>The Corfican chiefs, if they would be advi&s;ed by me, &s;hould form the plan of their future govern|ment, even while their affairs are low, and the event uncertain, le&s;t, hereafter, they &s;uffer great|er evils than ever yet they have felt, by inte&s;tine divi&s;ions; and are prompted by a &s;pirit of jealou&s;y or ambition to de&s;troy one another, when they have no other enemies to conquer. Were I to
<PB N="195" REF="196">pre&s;ide in their council, and the direction of this important affair were to be left to my judgment, I would not make choice of any form of government which is now admini&s;tered in the world: neither would I borrow my &s;y&s;tem from Plato's republic, or Sir Thomas More's Utopia, which &s;ound well in theory, but can never be reduced to practice. In &s;hort, I would pre&s;erve the rank and dignity of my country, by re&s;toring the ancient form of go|vernment, which was <HI>kingly</HI> or <HI>monarchial.</HI> A king I would have, and a king with a crown on his head, and a &s;cepter in his hand; to whom &s;hould be given the title of royal or imperial ma|je&s;ty. But my king &s;hould not be a tyrant. He &s;hould be even incapable of committing any acts of violence, or oppre&s;&s;ion. He &s;hould be entirely free from pride, avarice, and ambition. He &s;hould neither injure him&s;elf, or his &s;ubjects, through the heat and intemperance of youth, or the folly and dotage of old age. Love which has made one king a fool, and another mad, &s;hould never per|plex his head, or hurt his con&s;titution. His man|ners &s;hould be without blemi&s;h; and his greate&s;t enemies (if unde&s;ervedly he mu&s;t have enemies) &s;hould not be able to impute to him any impurity of mind, any unfriendly di&s;po&s;ition, or unevenne&s;s of temper. In a word, I would have &s;uch a king as Jupiter fir&s;t gave to the frogs<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the fable of the frogs who petitioned Jupiter for a king.</NOTE>; who, by the way po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his empire by divine right, and therefore his &s;ubjects were ju&s;tly puni&s;hed by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or for the in&s;ults which they offered to his per&s;on and character. However, I would not have a plain unfa&s;hionable Log. My prince &s;hould be made of the heart of oak, and wrought into the &s;hape and figure of a man by the mo&s;t &s;kilful arti&s;ts in Eu|rope.</P>
<P>To &s;peak intelligibly, I would have an image or &s;tatue as big as the life, well &s;haped, and finely
<PB N="196" REF="197">painted; with a diadem on his head, a royal mantle on his &s;houlders, and a &s;cepter in his right hand. He &s;hould be placed under a rich canopy, and &s;eated on a magnificent throne. A guard of an hundred halberdeers &s;hould be ap|pointed to attend him, not &s;o much for the &s;ecu|rity of his per&s;on, as to &s;erve for pomp and &s;hew at the audience of amba&s;&s;adors. This guard &s;hould be the only &s;tanding army in Cor&s;ica. For as there could be no u&s;e for &s;oldiers, but to defend the country in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion, &s;o, in that ca&s;e, every man &s;hould be a &s;oldier. There &s;hould be an e&s;tabli&s;hed militia, in which all the male inha|bitants, from eighteen to fifty years of age, capa|ble of bearing arms, &s;hould be inrolled, as is prac|ti&s;ed at this day among the Swi&s;s-Cantons. This militia &s;hould be provided with good arms, and regularly exerci&s;ed. The generals, colonels, and regularly exerci&s;ed. The generals, colonels, and all inferior officers, &s;hould be named by the &s;enate, as well as all other officers military and civil; among the re&s;t I include all the great officers of the crown, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But then it &s;hould not be lawful for any officer to excerci&s;e the employment confer|red on him, till his nomination had been con|firmed by the king, who &s;hould always be allowed a negative voice.</P>
<P>In like manner, new laws &s;hould be of no force till they had received his maje&s;ty's approbation, which &s;hould always be &s;ignified by his &s;ilence. But whenever he refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent, he mu&s;t be obliged to pronounce the word VETO three times with an audible voice, &s;o that it might be di&s;tinct|ly heard by all the people.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ecured the liberties of the &s;ubject, I think it in the next place incumbent on me, as a Cor&s;ican legi&s;lator, to maintain the dignity of the crown. I would not indeed ordain it as an article of faith, that the king held the reins of his govern|ment by a divine indefea&s;ible right; but yet I would
<PB N="197" REF="198">have his per&s;on &s;acred and inviolable. His &s;ub|jects of all degrees and orders &s;hould approach him with the greate&s;t reverence. Tho&s;e who were it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">troduced to him for a confirmation of their pri|vileges and employments, &s;hould be obliged to pro&s;|trate them&s;elves, and ki&s;s the hem of his garment. No per&s;on &s;hould pre&s;ume to &s;it, or &s;pit, or cough, or be covered in his pre&s;ence; unle&s;s it might here|after be thought proper, as a reward for great merit and &s;ervices to create a cla&s;s of <HI>grandees.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A Spani&s;h grandee keeps his hat on in the king's pre&s;ence. He increated by the words, be covered! without further ceremony.</NOTE></P>
<P>Foreign mini&s;ters, who are &s;ent to compliment the king on his acce&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t ob&s;erve the cere|monial e&s;tabli&s;hed at the court of Turin, when the King of Sardinia was acknowledged in that quality. All proper laws &s;hould be devi&s;ed for his &s;ecurity. And therefore, if any one &s;hould be &s;o audacious as to &s;teal away his maje&s;ty, or to maim, or disfigure his per&s;on, or to rob him of his crown or &s;ceptre, or any part of his robes, the of|fender &s;hould be guilty of trea&s;on, and be puni&s;h|ed with death.</P>
<P>If any per&s;on &s;hould propo&s;e in writing, or con|ver&s;ation, to aboli&s;h the pre&s;ent form of govern|ment, by depo&s;ing his wooden maje&s;ty, and &s;ub|&s;tituting in his &s;tead a monarch of fle&s;h and blood, whether man, woman, or bea&s;t, the offender &s;hould likewi&s;e be guilty of high-trea&s;on. Provided always, that the words be expre&s;s and &s;ufficiently proved, and that no free Cor&s;ican be vexed or puni&s;hed by <HI>innuendos,</HI> and forced con&s;tructions; or for any figurative, allegorical, or ambiguous &s;peeches. Provided likewi&s;e, that this law &s;hall not extend to re&s;train the freedom of debate in the &s;enate and council.</P>
<P>But now I de&s;ire it may be under&s;tood, that in this new &s;cheme of government, which I have in|vented for the good people of Cor&s;ica, I only re|quire
<PB N="198" REF="199">the &s;ub&s;tance of the king's per&s;on to be of oak. I do not ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;t that he mu&s;t al|ways retain a human form. Let it be varied accord|ing to the exigencies of the &s;tate, or the humours of the people.</P>
<P>For the matter, I prefer the oak to all other tim|ber, on account of its duration; and becau&s;e that tree, con&s;idered only as a &s;imple vegetable, bears &s;ome analogy to a crown'd head: it having been held &s;acred in all countries and ages of the world, The ancient Druids paid a greater veneration to the oak, than to the mo&s;t illu&s;trious of the &s;ons of Adam. And even among us Engli&s;hmen, in a very inqui&s;itive and polite age, I mean about the mid|dle of the la&s;t century, this tree obtained the title of <HI>royal.</HI>&mdash;The Greeks and Romans had &s;o great a reverence for this tree, as to imagine, that every oak was the habitation of a divinity; and there was an oaken grove, within one of the gates of Rome, where all the trees were wor&s;hipped as &s;o many nymphs and godde&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t renowned of all their &s;pecies were the Epirotick oaks, the illu&s;trious natives of Dodo|na; who were not only endued with human &s;peech, but were prophets and poets, the mo&s;t exalted characters of mankind; and by which two of the greate&s;t princes in the world have been &s;o eminent|ly di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>If the compa&s;s of my paper would allow it, I would add much more in honour of the oak. But what I have &s;aid may &s;uffice, to prevent the ridi|cule of political writers, and the objections and indignities, which they might otherwi&s;e offer to my wooden king.</P>
<P>I am fully per&s;uaded, there is not a monarch now living upon the earth, who would not think him&s;elf very happy, and ble&s;&s;ed above all his bre|thren, to be heart of oak; e&s;pecially if he be turned of fifty. And the ble&s;&s;ing would be dou|bled,
<PB N="199" REF="200">if by this change he might be allowed to de|rive his pedigree from the hou&s;e of Dodona. In truth, an oak of this family is capable of governing the greate&s;t kingdoms, even the va&s;t empire of China and Japan. How would the people of tho&s;e countries admire his eminent qualities, and the faculties of his mind! And I am &s;ure they would not pre&s;ume to find fault with his per&s;on and fa|mily, who was de&s;cended from as ancient a &s;tock, and formed of as good &s;tuff as their gods. How|ever, I ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s, that the oaks of this race are not for my purpo&s;e, and mu&s;t therefore be excluded from my &s;cheme of government. Prophets of all complections, nations, and religi|ons, whether great or &s;mall, whether fal&s;e or true, when they are once made kings, will claim an ab|&s;olute independent &s;overeignty. The hi&s;tory of all ages, and the actions of all the royal prophets, from King David down to King Mahomet, &s;ufficiently verify my a&s;&s;ertion. For that rea&s;on I recommend the oaks of Dodona to the government of the ea&s;t, where every king and every vice-king is a tyrant.</P>
<P>As for the monarchs of Cor&s;ica, according to my e&s;tabli&s;hment, they mu&s;t not have the u&s;e of &s;peech, and then they will have no u&s;e for power. Wherefore I advi&s;e tho&s;e i&s;landers to content them|&s;elves with kings that are the growth of their own woods, if they have any woods left. If not, they may import a good &s;tout king of any &s;ize, well &s;haped and poli&s;hed, and fa&s;hionably dre&s;&s;ed, from any great city on the continent<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The principal manufactories of this &s;ort are thought to be the Hague in Holland, and a little in&s;ignificant place in &s;ome part of Germany, the name of which I cannot immediately recollect, but believe it begins with an H.</NOTE> I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the con&s;ideration of the &s;enate, whether they will be at the charge of a queen. For as &s;he can contribute nothing to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the expence of the &s;culpture, her royal ve&s;tments, &s;ervants and
<PB N="200" REF="201">officers will be an unnece&s;&s;ary incumbrance on the civil li&s;t; be&s;ides I can prove from ancient hi&s;tory, that a wooden queen, hath &s;ometimes done as much mi&s;chief as a wooden hor&s;e, and overturned mighty kingdoms.</P>
<P>I would certainly provide by the &s;tronge&s;t laws, that no prie&s;t &s;hould have a vote in the &s;enate or council, nor any employment about the per&s;on of his Cor&s;ican maje&s;ty. I &s;hould be under dreadful apprehen&s;ions, le&s;t tho&s;e teeming heads exalt my king into a god, and then tax the people to fur|ni&s;h provi&s;ions for his table. <HI>See&s;t thou not how he eateth and drinketh, and thinke&s;t thou not that he is a god?</HI> In which ca&s;e, the theocracy of the wood|en god would prove the wor&s;t kind of tyranny. For this little i&s;land would &s;oon be devoured to manife&s;t the power of the governor, and &s;upport the luxury of his mini&s;ters; who are better craft&s;|men than to be di&s;covered, like tho&s;e idiot prie&s;ts of Bel, by a trap door, and a &s;ack of a&s;hes &s;trewed upon the pavement.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I am writing this, I am informed by the Holland mail, that King Theodore has abdicated the crown of Cor&s;ica, and is now impri&s;oned for debt at Am&s;terdam<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He was long confined on the &s;ame account, in the King's Bench pri&s;on! and died &s;oon after his di&s;charge, under the in&s;ol|vent debtors act, having given up his kingdom for the benefit of his creditors.</NOTE>, Though I am as truly con|cerned for the misfortune of this enterpri&s;ing mo|narch, as any of his loving &s;ubjects, yet I mu&s;t own, it le&s;&s;ens my grief to con&s;ider, that this &s;ud|den revolution will make way for my propo&s;al, and facilitate the acce&s;&s;ion of my wooden king. For which rea&s;on, I will direct the&s;e &s;hort hints to be tran&s;lated into Italian, for the u&s;e of the Cor|&s;ican chiefs, and the people now in arms under their command.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I rejoice to be the in&s;trument of giv|ing
<PB N="201" REF="202">them a king, who, to &s;peak without a figure, can do no wrong! a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch princes would not be le&s;s glorious for them&s;elves, than be|neficial to their country. They would be univer|&s;ally e&s;teemed during their reigns, and their me|mories &s;weet and precious. Happy had it been for the world, if the long catalogue of Roman emperors (three or four only excepted) had been of the wooden &s;pecies!</P>

<P>AS an apology for the exi&s;ting de&s;poti&s;ms, it is &s;aid, That all men are by nature tyrants, and will exerci&s;e their tyrannies whenever they find opportunity. Allowing this a&s;&s;ertion to be true, it is &s;urely cited by the wrong party.

<HEAD>A FURTHER ACCOUNT OF SPENSONIA.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>[Continued from page 72, Vol. II.]</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE continent not being far di&s;tant from the I&s;land of Spen&s;onia, produced &s;everal inter|views between the re&s;pective inhabitants, and of
<PB N="206" REF="207">cour&s;e frequent traffickings and dealings, which, on the part of the Spen&s;onians, were conducted with the utmo&s;t &s;implicity and good faith. This uprightne&s;s gained much on the affections of the Indians, and naturally produced a yet nearer com|munication. Contrary to expectation, they here &s;aw a people, much &s;uperior in the comforts of life, as independent as them&s;elves; and though Chri&s;tians, without tho&s;e <HI>odious tyrants</HI> to mankind, LAND|LORDS. "How," &s;aid an Indian to a Spen&s;onian, "How is it that you have no Landlords? We ne|ver heard that men could be civilized, or be Chri&s;|tians, without giving up their common right to the earth, and its natural produce to tyrants, called Landlords. Among &s;uch people, according to uni|ver&s;al report, the land is claimed by a few indivi|duals, who di&s;po&s;e of it at plea&s;ure, and parcel it out to others for tribute or rent. Many colonies of Chri&s;tians have e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in various parts of America, and carry on here, as in their original country, the iniquitous traffick in the &s;oil. They expel, or exterminate us, the natives, becau&s;e we will not work, or pay rent to them, for living in our own country; neither have the&s;e Europeans the common hone&s;ty to &s;hare equally, among them|&s;elves, their unrighteous plunder; but levy rents of each other here, as they do at home. Yes, their religion it &s;eems will not allow of equality of rights. Their God, they tell us, has ordained that there &s;hall be many <HI>&s;orts and conditions of men,</HI> and that &s;ome few &s;hall have the lord&s;hip and di&s;po&s;al of the earth, whil&s;t the far greater part mu&s;t be re|duced to &s;upplicate to become their tributaries and va&s;&s;als. This has always made us hate your God and your religion. Ju&s;tice being impartiality, par|tiality mu&s;t be inju&s;tice; and that God, who is &s;o partial, cannot be ju&s;t; and not being ju&s;t, cannot be loved. We cannot love inju&s;tice, nor the pro|moters of inju&s;tice. Neither can we, free-born Indians, &s;ubmit to pay homage or rent to any man
<PB N="207" REF="208">for leave to dwell on the earth, though he &s;hould &s;ay that God would have it &s;o. But you &s;ay, <HI>you</HI> are Chri&s;tians, and that you, <HI>neverthele&s;s.</HI> have <HI>no</HI> Landlords; but have an equitable way of enjoying the common benefits of this i&s;land which you in|habit, and yet pre&s;erve to each man his independ|ence! &mdash; This is very amazing to me!"</P>
<P>The curio&s;ity of this Indian was &s;atisfied; he was made to comprehend the brotherly &s;y&s;tem, and that the God of the Chri&s;tians was belied by de&s;ign|ing prie&s;ts, colleagued with overbearing knaves; and that he did not approve, but condemned and puni&s;hed inju&s;tice, u&s;urpation, and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The enraptured Indian &s;ighed for the dome&s;tic happine&s;s of civilized life, combined with his na|tive independence. He was adopted a citizen, and was happy. Other Indians heard, &s;aw, and fol|lowed the example. The i&s;land now became very populous and highly cultivated, and many villages encrea&s;ed to large towns, adorned with public edi|fices, and other marks of opulence and refinement; Trade flouri&s;hed, &s;hips were built, and commerce extended to di&s;tant &s;hores its reciprocal ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of pro&s;perity (&s;ays the author of this account) did I find this ri&s;ing colony, when by accident, &s;ome years ago, our &s;hip was driven upon this happy i&s;land.</P>
<P>I, like the afore&s;aid Indian, was a&s;toni&s;hed when I under&s;tood their &s;y&s;tem of government, and man|ner of holding landed property. For in&s;tead of anarchy, idlene&s;s, poverty, and meanne&s;s, the na|tural con&s;equences, as I narrowly thought, of a ridiculous levelling &s;cheme, I &s;aw nothing but or|der, indu&s;try, wealth, and magnificence. So being anxious to know the utmo&s;t of this new-fa&s;hioned commonwealth, I took occa&s;ion to have my doubts re&s;olved by a communicative Spen&s;onian as follows:</P>
<P>Author. <HI>And &s;o none, notwith&s;tanding the &s;plendid appearance the country makes, and the exten&s;ive manner
<PB N="208" REF="209">in which trade is carried on, have e&s;tates, nor can pur|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e any?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Spen&s;onian.</HI> No, nor is it likely ever will; nor does the happine&s;s of human life, or bu&s;ine&s;s, re|quire any &s;uch refarious traffick.</P>
<P>Auth. <HI>Would it not tend to make the people more in|du&s;trious if they could lay out their riches in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Spen.</HI> If they were more indu&s;trious in order to buy land, other people, being reduced to be their tenants, would, through poverty and oppre&s;&s;ion, be dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ived of the means of indu&s;try; and by de|&s;pair, of the incitement to it. Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of landed property, men would cea&s;e to be otherwi&s;e indu&s;trious, than in watching their tenants, in or|der to rai&s;e their rents, and infringe their liberties. Their po&s;terity al&s;o, would become equally u&s;ele&s;s, except in the &s;ame laudable bu&s;ine&s;s of oppre&s;&s;ion. The &s;ame pretence, as to objects of indu&s;try, might extend to religion, and the per&s;ons of men. Why &s;hould traffic be denied to monied men in any thing capable of being an object of commerce!! But why de&s;pair of indu&s;try?

Cur&s;e them: I never can think of them but with dete&s;tation. I can compare them and their ca&s;tles to nothing but the giants and their ca&s;tles in ro|mances. Tho&s;e giants were &s;aid to be a terror and de&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uction to all the people around, &s;o in reality are the dukes, lords, and barons of the pre&s;ent day. Therefore, the &s;tories of enormous and tyrannical giants, dwelling in &s;trong ca&s;tles, which have been thought fabulous, may rea&s;onably be looked upon as di&s;gai&s;ed truths, and to have been invented as ju&s;t &s;atires upon great lords. For, if tho&s;e fabu|lous mon&s;ters were &s;aid to eat the people and their children, your real mon&s;ters, of Landlords, really eat their meat, and the &s;avour out of every enjoy|ment; reducing them to &s;uch mi&s;ery, that eating their bodies, as the giants did, would be much more beneficent. They toil them to death in their endle&s;s drudgery, hara&s;s and butcher them in their villainous wars, and drag them from every &s;ocial connection. The&s;e are the mon&s;ters, or giants, that the world want to be rid of. The extirpation of the&s;e &s;hould employ the philanthropic giant-kil|lers, the deliverers of mankind.</P>
<P>Auth. <HI>But notwith&s;tanding all your heat again&s;t tho&s;e Landlords, tho&s;e mon&s;ters as you call them, I &s;hould like to know why you think they will never get crept in among you, as they have in all other civilized nations?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Spen.</HI> Why, you mu&s;t know, the intere&s;t of every individual is &s;o intimately and palpably con|nected with our pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, that the lea&s;t in|novation would immediately be felt, and, of cour&s;e, oppo&s;ed. People are generally very much attached to their landed propenty, and &s;ocieties in particu|lar, are very tenacious of &s;uch, e&s;pecially when they, as we do, find daily the benefit thereof. Then can we &s;uppo&s;e any would be &s;o hardy as attempt to touch a whole nation in &s;o &s;en&s;ible a part?</P>
<P>Auth. <HI>But bribery, my friend, bribery; that is the invincible Leviathan that overturns the rights of man|kind.
<PB N="210" REF="211">That may get among you, and numbers may be hired to &s;ell the interests of the public, both pre&s;ent and future, for a little pre&s;ent gain, and be ready either to vote or fight again&s;t them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Spen.</HI> Well, I will let you &s;ee that though you were to bribe the whole nation you could do no|thing by voting, and that you mu&s;t have a very large majority, before you can have any chance by fighting. You mu&s;t under&s;tand we never vote but by ballot, or in a &s;ecret manner, either in parochial or parliamentary bu&s;ine&s;s. Now &s;uppo&s;e you would bribe the whole of the voters in any affair, and I were one of them, I would rea&s;on thus with my|&s;elf: If I vote as I am brihed to do, I mu&s;t do wrong to the public, who&s;e intere&s;t includes al&s;o my own, and perhaps the intere&s;t likewi&s;e of po&s;|terity. If there be but one vote again&s;t my briber, he may &s;ay it is mine; and if I deny it, &s;o may he that gave this vote, and has as good a chance to be believed, there being no witne&s;&s;es; whereby I will have the mortification to have wronged my coun|try and con&s;cience, without being able to clear my&s;elf in your &s;ight. So, in con&s;equence of this rea&s;oning, I would vote again&s;t you; and &s;o would every one el&s;e from the &s;ame con&s;ideration. Let us &s;ee how this ca&s;e will &s;tand then? Why you would chide me privately (for you dur&s;t not do it public|ly) for not voting for you, though hired. I would &s;ay, how do you know that? Becau&s;e, &s;ay you, I have not one vote, <HI>(for remember, if you had but one vote, I would lay claim to it.)</HI> and therefore not yours. What, not one vote! I would exclaim, No, not one; &s;ay you. Well then, I would an|&s;wer, I have the comfort to think I am no wor&s;e than others: This will teach you to come hither again to buy votes, Be&s;ides, if I had voted for you, others might have claimed, with you, the merit of the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, while I would have had the whole of the guilt; and, at be&s;t, an equal &s;hare of
<PB N="211" REF="212">the &s;u&s;picion. So there is an end to your hurting us by voting.</P>
<P>Auth. <HI>I am now convinced, that &s;o long as you vote by ballot, or &s;ecretly, there does not appear a po&s;&s;ibility of hurting you in that quarter. But is it not beneath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reemen to vote thus clandestin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, as if afraid to act hone&s;tly in the face of the world? Moreover, you lo&s;e all the prai&s;e of your good deeds, which is a general incite|ment to worthy actions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Spen.</HI> In your country they vote in the open manner you commend. What is the con&s;equence? Why the Mini&s;try tells you it is nece&s;&s;ary to have a majority on their &s;ide for the di&s;patch of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, which amounts to the &s;ame thing as pleading for no parliament at all. A majority therefore is procured, in a very honourable way no doubt. &s;he minority not being bought (for a majority is &s;uffi|cient) take every opportunity to &s;hew their impor|tance, by oppo&s;ing all bu&s;ine&s;s indi&s;criminately, whether right or wrong. Indeed they have often but too much rea&s;on to oppo&s;e, yet let their ha|rangues be ever &s;o violent, they can never make the majority under&s;tand in any other way than the Mini&s;ter would have them; for they are too fa&s;t a&s;leep in the lap of corruption, to regard either their arguments or the prai&s;es of their country. Thus you &s;ee the weak influence of fame, which you build &s;o much on, even among &s;enators; what &s;trength mu&s;t it then have among the poor free|holders and burghers, after &s;o glorious an ex|ample!</P>
<P>This general corruption, and conflict of intere&s;ts, furni&s;h endle&s;s materials for new&s;papers, pamph|lets, and &s;tate coblers. Thou&s;an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tive &s;chemes are daily propo&s;ed for redre&s;&s;ing grievan|ces and mending the con&s;tit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion; whereas, the &s;hoes were &s;o i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l-made at fir&s;t are &s;o worn, rotten, and patched already, that they are not worth fur|ther trouble or expence, but ought to be thrown to

Then would your controver&s;ies about this, and the other way of cobling, that continu|ally agitate you, be done away; and you would walk along the rugged and dirty path of life ea&s;y and dry-&s;hod.</P>
<P>And now you &s;hall witne&s;s with your own eyes, that force is likely to &s;ucceed as ill again&s;t us as &s;ecret corruption. Therefore you mu&s;t go with me to-moorow, a few miles off, it being a ge|neral review day, when the inhabitants of &s;everal pari&s;hes together are to go through their military exerci&s;e, under the eye of a general, provided by the &s;tate. Every pari&s;h, or ward of a pari&s;h, exer|ci&s;e them&s;elves at their own convenience; but two or three times a year, &s;everal pari&s;hes are affembled together, as I &s;aid, to accu&s;tom them&s;elves to act in large bodies, as you will &s;ee to-morrow.</P>
<P>Accordingly next morning we were rou&s;ed early by the drums all over the country beating to arms. No man lagged behind that was able to march: but my friend, luckily for me, happened to be lame, yet not &s;o as to prevent his hobbling there to be a &s;pectator. I was a &s;tranger, and therefore had no|thing to do with them; and &s;o went with my friend al&s;o to look on. The morning was exceeding fine, the military ground was &s;pacious, and kept always in pa&s;turage for that purpo&s;e. The pari&s;hes, in different liveries, came marching in from every di|rection, with artillery, banners, and mu&s;ic. Tho&s;e who had good hor&s;es, were hor&s;emen; and formed into troops according to the colour of their hor&s;es. The very boys too were furn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hed with &s;mall arms, and cla&s;&s;ed according to their &s;izes. It was de|lightful to behold &s;o many thou&s;and citizen &s;oldiers in arms only of defence; an army of <Q>men, who their duties know, and know their rights; and, knowing, dare maintain.</Q> In &s;hort, they made
<PB N="213" REF="214">a gallant appearance, and every one was adorned with what little ornament his rank and uniform admitted of; as medals received for improvements, public &s;ervices, &amp;c. Every eye &s;parkled with de|light, and every countenance was expre&s;&s;ive of happine&s;s, for this is their mo&s;t agreeable &s;port Emulative obedience to command, and dexterity of action, was every where con&s;picuous. What contributed much to this, was, that nothing but eminent merit can advance any to be officers, who mu&s;t pa&s;s through every &s;tation to the highe&s;t, if their merit can carry them &s;o far. They went through their &s;everal manceuvres like veterans, but the boys in particular made a plea&s;ing &s;ight. No play whatever gives them &s;uch delight as this military exerci&s;e, which they apply to with &s;uch diligence, that before they leave &s;chool, or are fit for other employments, they are as complete there|in as the olde&s;t. For this purpo&s;e all due encou|ragement is given them; a particular in&s;tance of which appeared at this time: They made a mock fight with the men and drove them off the ground, which clo&s;e the review. Every party then with colours flying as they came, marched to their re|&s;pective homes, to &s;pend the remainder of the day in fe&s;tivity and joy.</P>
<P>The merry bells now &s;ounded from every &s;teeple. The glad females, after fea&s;ting their manly &s;pou&s;es and paramours, prepared for the dance; and thro' the evening, revelled in plea&s;ures known to love and innocence alone. Among other &s;ports, there were &s;hooting matches and cudgel playing, which are favourite diver&s;ons, and encouraged, on &s;uch days as this, by medals from the pari&s;hes. The victors are very proud of the&s;e medals, and, as ob&s;erved before, wear them on extraordinary oc|ca&s;ions and field days.</P>
<P>I can never enought admire the beauty of the country. It has more the air of a garden, or ra|ther
<PB N="214" REF="215">a paradi&s;e than a gencral country &s;cene; and indeed it is only a continuation of gardens and orchards. For be&s;ides the infinite number of real gardens, the very fields, meadows and pa&s;tures, are plentifully &s;trewed with fruit trees, and the corn is cuitivated in rows. and as carefully as garden herbs. The hou&s;es and every thing about them are &s;o amiably neat, and &s;o indicative of dome&s;tic happine&s;s, &s;o far di&s;tant from the in&s;lated pomp and gha&s;tly &s;olemnity of the palaces of the great, and the confined, mi&s;erable depre&s;&s;ion of the ho|vels of the wretched, that they &s;eem the habita|tions of rational be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngs; of beings worthy the ap|probation of the Deity, becau&s;e, though as he de|&s;igned them they be lords of all his works, <HI>they pre|&s;ume not be Lords of each other.</HI></P>
<P>On expre&s;&s;ing my &s;urprize at &s;o much private felicity and public convenience, my friend an|&s;wered, "The pari&s;hes build and repair hou&s;es, make roads, plant hedges and trees, and in a word do all the bu&s;ine&s;s of a Landlord. And you have &s;een what &s;ort of Landlords they are. I &s;uppo&s;e you do not meet with much to repair or improve, And it is no wonder, for a pari&s;h has many heads to contrive what ought to be done. In&s;tead of de|bating about mending the &s;tate, as with you, (for ours needs no mending) we employ our ingenuity nearer home, and the re&s;ult of our debates are in every pari&s;h, how we &s;hall work &s;uch a mine, make &s;uch a river navigable, drain &s;uch a fen, or improve &s;uch a wa&s;te. The&s;e things we are all immediately intere&s;ted in, and have each a vote in executing; and thus we are not mere &s;pectators in the world, but as all men ought to be, actors, and that only for our own benefit."</P>
<P>The next day following we commenced again our political conver&s;ation, as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Spen.</HI> Now our whole country is trained and peopled as you have &s;een, I therefore &s;uppo&s;e you
<PB N="215" REF="216">have dropt all hopes of fighting us out of our Li|berties, and if there were a po&s;&s;ibility of voting them away, we would not neverthele&s;s part with them. Nay, we will not &s;uffer any law in the lea&s;t impolitic, to give us unea&s;ine&s;s long; for we are too knowing and too powerful to be impo&s;ed upon or brow-beat; which makes our Parliament very careful how they make laws.</P>
<P>Auth. <HI>I must indeed own that you have no great rea&s;on to be afraid of any encroachment on your consti|tution, whilst you continue your two guardian angels; I mean</HI> VOTING BY BALLOT, <HI>and</HI> THE UNIVERSAL U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">E OF ARMS. <HI>But I beg the &s;ame liberty to make ob|juctions that my countryment will be apt to take when I inform them of your uncommon customs, that I may be the more enabled to an&s;wer them, Do not people repine that the place they occupy is not their own: that they must pay rent; that they cannot do with it what they plea&s;e; and that they cannot enfeo&s;&s; their posterity with the improv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ments they may make?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Spen.</HI> So you think that the unrea&s;oning de&s;ires of wayward individuals &s;hould be complied with, to the detriment of a whole people? Private pro|perty in land, is either ju&s;t, according to the law of nature, or it is not. That it is not, is evident from the unnatural and oppre&s;&s;ive con&s;equences flowing from it. If all tyranny, and abu&s;es in government, flow only from that monopolizing &s;y&s;tem, it mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be the fountain head of tyranny; &s;earch hi&s;tory, and &s;ee, that the govern|ment of every country ever was, and is, in the proprietors of land. If then the people wi&s;h to have the government in their own hands, they mu&s;t begin fir&s;t, by taking the land into their own hands.</P>
<P>Who is the Lord Paramount of the univer&s;e? Is he not God? He then, and he alone, or tho&s;e whom he deputes, mu&s;t have the rents. Now the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ipture &s;ays, that the has given the earth to the
<PB N="216" REF="217">children of men; given it to mankind in common Then mankind in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts are his &s;ub&s;titutes and repre&s;entatives, and have a right to receive, and di&s;po&s;e of the revenues ari&s;ing from the Domains, which he in his providence permits them &s;everally to po&s;&s;e&s;s. Some will &s;ay, that though God gave the earth to the chidren of men, in com|mon, they may have private po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. I an&s;wer, yes; if they live far, I mean <HI>very far,</HI> a&s;under. But in no populous country, &s;ince the beginning of the world, was private property in land enjoyed, but to the detriment of multitudes of the &s;ame community: Suppo&s;e a populous country were divided equally among the inhabitants, as was the land of Canaan among the I&s;raelites, how long would their &s;hares continue equal? In a few years &s;ome men's fami|lies would increa&s;e and others decrea&s;e, which would &s;con produce inequality of e&s;tates, even though neither the right of primogeniture nor alienation of property were allowed. Tho&s;e who became heirs to tho&s;e decrea&s;ed families, would become richer; and tho&s;e who had but a &s;mall &s;hare among many brethren, of their paternal inheritance would become poorer; and even a periodical jubi|lee would not prevent inju&s;tice and inequality. But, by &s;haring the rents, man's equal rights and dignity is pre&s;erved, in every generation, and in every &s;tate of population. If God be ju&s;t he mu&s;t approve of &s;o ju&s;t and impartial a &s;y&s;tem. We pre&s;ume that he is &s;o, and that he is not di&s;plea&s;ed at his revenues, being di&s;po&s;ed of &s;o much to the happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>We then admit but of ONE LORD, as we do of ONE GOD; and in his name our rents are collected and di&s;po&s;ed of as we believe, according to his will and plea&s;ure. We do not murmer, as you &s;uppo&s;e, at paying rent: How &s;hould we, when we con&s;ider for who&s;e u&s;e it is? Does not the ren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> paid here, &s;erve in&s;tead of taxes and rates of ever
<PB N="217" REF="218">de&s;cription and is it not wholly at our own d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;|po&s;al? And when the public e&s;tabli&s;hments are provided for, is not the remainder divided equally among us? If when premi&s;es become vacant by death, or otherwi&s;e, they be let to the be&s;t bidder; is not that the faire&s;t way? It &s;hews no parti|ality and prevents collu&s;ion to the prejudice of the public.</P>
<P>And do you think that the people, while a man lives and pays his rent, will be &s;o ungene|rous as turn him out of his hou&s;e or farm? No&mdash;To prevent families indeed, from looking on their tenements as hereditary, the public may think it prudent, at the decea&s;e of a man, or his widow, to take again their property into their own hands, and di&s;po&s;e of it again to the be&s;t bidder. And what ju&s;t rea&s;ons will the &s;ons have to complain? Are they not part of that public, who&s;e intere&s;t every man ought to promote and be jealous of for his own &s;ake? But to prevent all colour of inju&s;tice, on account of improvements, medals and premi|ums are always be&s;towed on tho&s;e, while they live, who remarkably improve the public property. Your European landlords give no &s;uch rewards nor &s;hew &s;uch favour, on account of improve|ments, that you need to &s;urmi&s;e &s;o many idle grie|vances under a &s;y&s;tem of purity &s;ufficient for the heavens.</P>
<P>I could not, in my heart, teaze my friend any further, with my frivolous objections; for I was fully convinced that, if ever there be a millen|nium or heaven upon earth, it can only exi&s;t under the <HI>benign</HI> SYSTEM of SPENSONIA.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e and beneficient regulations and lawse|minating from this &s;y&s;tem of &s;implicity are beyond conception, beautiful and conducive of public happine&s;s. Many in&s;tances might be given, which, other &s;ocieties, not built on the public good, can
<PB N="218" REF="219">never adopt. For example: If any man po&s;&s;e&s;s an invention, or &s;ecret, in medicine, or other &s;cience, or art, of importance to mankind, the &s;tate does not fir&s;t tax the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or by &s;elling him a patent, and then load his manufactures with &s;tamps and duties, thereby counteracting as much as po&s;|&s;ible, the kind intentions of the deity, in ble&s;&s;ing his creatures with &s;uch an invention. No: the parliament is <HI>obleged</HI> to purcha&s;e the &s;ecret, and publi&s;h it. Remember, I &s;ay, <HI>obliged;</HI> for as it is only for purpo&s;es evidently u&s;eful, that their go|vernment dare di&s;po&s;e of the public money, at all, &s;o neither dare they be &s;paring, when public uti|lity demands it. Thus no quacks or impo&s;ters, under pretence of &s;ecrets, are &s;uffered to impo&s;e on mankind, to ruin their healths, or pick their pockets. Neither does any complain, that his in|ventions, or his labours have been unrewarded, through all the <HI>happy regions of</HI> SPENSONIA.</P>

<HEAD>Strictures o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Second Part of Paine's Rights of Man, with copious Extracts.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">(From the Analytical Review for March, 1792.)</HEAD>
<P>COURTEOUS reader, we announce to thee, the publication of the Second part of the Rights of Man. Wert thou plea&s;ed with the fir&s;t part? Thou wilt be delighted with the &s;econd. Did&s;t thou &s;ay of the former, &s;uch a work de&s;erves no other con&s;utation than that of criminal ju&s;tice? Thou wilt &s;ay of this, the only way to an&s;wer it is to hang the author.</P>
<P>For our parts, we wi&s;h neither to kindle thy hopes, nor to provoke thy horrors. Lo! we in|troduce thee to the author, and leave thoe and him to &s;ettle the proper mode of confutation. Only keep your tempers. We will &s;it by; and as re|viewers of the controver&s;y, will occa&s;ionally break &s;ilence. We will al&s;o take the liberty of dropping at the clo&s;e a few remarks, to qualify your tem|pers, if you &s;hould chance to di&s;agree.</P>
<P>Thou wilt perceive, reader, at the out&s;et, that Mr. P: &s;o far from thinking he has received any defeat from the replies made to his former publica|tion, conceives him&s;elf to &s;tand on an eminence, a&s;&s;erts a victory, and claims a triumph. p. vii.</P>
<P>'Several other rea&s;ons contributed to produce this determination (of deferring the remainder of his work.) I wi&s;hed to know the manner in which a work, written in a &s;tyle of thinking and expre&s;&s;ion different to what had been cu&s;tomary in England, would be received before I proceeded farther. A great field was opening to the view of mankind by means of the French Revolution. Mr. Burke's outrageous oppo&s;ition thereto brought the controver&s;y into England. He attacked prin|ciples which he knew (from information) I would conte&s;t with him, becau&s;e they are principles I believe to be good, and which I have contributed
<PB N="224" REF="225">to e&s;tabli&s;h, and conceive my&s;elf bound to defend, Had he not urged the controver&s;y, I had mo&s;t probably been a &s;ilent man.</P>
<P>'Another rea&s;on was, that Mr. Burke promi&s;ed in his fir&s;t publication to renew the &s;ubject at ano|ther opportunity, and to make a compari&s;on of what he called the Engli&s;h and French Con&s;titu|tions. I therefore held my&s;elf in re&s;erve for him, He has publi&s;hed two works &s;ince, without doing this; which he certainly would not have omitted, had the compari&s;on been in his favour.</P>
<P>'In his la&s;t work, <HI>"His appeal from the new to the old Whigs,"</HI> he has quoted about ten pages from the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and having given him&s;elf the trouble of doing this, &s;ays, <Q>he &s;hall not attempt in the &s;malle&s;t degree to refute them,</Q> meaning the principles therein contained. I am enough ac|quainted with Mr. Burke to know, that he would if he could. But in&s;tead of conte&s;ting them, he immediately after con&s;oles him&s;elf with &s;aying, that "he has done his part."&mdash;He has not done his part. He has not performed his promi&s;e of a compari&s;on of con&s;titutions. He &s;tarted the con|trover&s;y, he gave the challenge, and has fled from it; and he is now a <HI>ca&s;e in point</HI> with his own opi|nion, that, <HI>"the age of chivalry is gone!"</HI></P>
<P>'The title, as well as the &s;ub&s;tance of his l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t work, his <HI>"Appeal,"</HI> is his condemnation. Prin|ciples mu&s;t &s;tand on their own merits, and if they are good, they certainly will. To put them un|der the &s;helter of other men's authority, as Mr. Burke has done, &s;erves to bring them into &s;u&s;pi|cion. Mr. Burke is not very fond of dividing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s honours, but in this ca&s;e he is artfully dividing the di&s;grace.</P>
<P>'But who are tho&s;e to whom Mr. Burke has made his appeal? A &s;et of childi&s;h thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kers and half-way politicians born in the la&s;t century; men who went no farther with any principle than as it
<PB N="225" REF="226">&s;uited their purpo&s;e as a party; the nation was al|ways le&s;t out of the que&s;tion; and this has been the character of every party from that day to this. The nation &s;ees nothing in &s;uch works, or &s;uch politics worthy its attention. A little matter will move a party, but it mu&s;t be &s;omething great that moves a nation.</P>
<P>'Though I &s;ee nothing in Mr. Burke's Appeal worth taking notice of, there is, however, one expre&s;&s;ion upon which I &s;hall offer a few remarks. After quoting largely from the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and declining to conte&s;t the principles contained in that work, he &s;ays, <Q>this will mo&s;t probably be done <HI>(if &s;uch writings shall be thought to de&s;erve any other refutation than that of criminal ju&s;tice)</HI> by others, who may think with Mr. Burke, and with the &s;ame zeal,</Q></P>
<P>'In the fir&s;t place, it has not yet been done by any body. Not le&s;s I believe, than eight or ten pamphlets intended as an&s;wers to the former part of the "Rights of Man" have been publi&s;hed by different per&s;ons, and not one of them, to my knowledge, has extended to a &s;econd edition, nor are even the titles of them &s;o much as generally remembered. As I am aver&s;e to unnece&s;&s;arily mul|tiplying publications, I have an&s;wered none of them. And as I believe that a man may write him&s;elf out of reputation when nobody el&s;e can do it, I am careful to avoid that rock.</P>
<P>'But as I would decline unnece&s;&s;ary publicati|ons on the one hand, &s;o would I avoid every thing that might appear like &s;ullen pride on the other. If Mr, Burke, or any other per&s;on on his &s;ide the que&s;tion, will produce an an&s;wer to the "Rights of Man," that &s;hall extend to an half, or even to a fourth part of the number of copies to which the Rights of Man extended, I will reply to his work. But untill this be done, I &s;hall &s;o far take the &s;en&s;e of the public for my guide, (and the world knows
<PB N="226" REF="227">I am not a flatterer) that what they do not think worth while to read, is not worth mine to an&s;wer, I &s;uppo&s;e the number of copies to which the fir&s;t part of the <HI>Rights of Man</HI> extended, taking En|gland, Scotland, and fieland, is not le&s;s than be|tween forty and fifty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>Mr. P. taking the common notion of the excel|lency of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution (Mr. P. will ex|cu&s;e our u&s;ing that expre&s;&s;ion) to be fallacious, and aiming to prepare his readers for remarks on its imperfections, proceeds as follows. P. XIV.</P>
<P>'As to the prejudices which men have from education and habit, in favour of any particular form or &s;y&s;tem of government, tho&s;e prejudices have yet to &s;tand the te&s;t of rea&s;on and reflection. In fact, &s;uch prejudices are nothing. No man is prejudiced in favour of a thing, knowing it to be wrong. He is attached to it on the belief of its being right; and when he &s;ees it is not &s;o, the prejudice will be gone. We have but a defective idea of what prejudice is. It might be &s;aid, that until men think for them&s;elves the whole is pre|judice, and <HI>not opinion;</HI> for that only is opinion which is the re&s;ult of rea&s;on and reflection. I offer this remark, that Mr. Burke may not con&s;ide too much in what has been the cu&s;tomary preju|dices of the country.</P>
<P>'I do not believe that the people of England have ever been fairly and candidly dealt by. They have been impo&s;ed upon by parties, and by men a&s;&s;uming the character of leaders. It is time that the nation &s;hould ri&s;e above tho&s;e trifles. It is time to di&s;mi&s;s that inattention which has &s;o long been the encouraging cau&s;e of &s;tretching taxation to exce&s;s. It is time to di&s;mi&s;s all tho&s;e &s;ongs and toa&s;ts which are calculated to en&s;lave, and ope|rate to &s;uffocate reflection. On all &s;uch &s;ubjects men have but to think, and they will neither act wrong, nor be mi&s;led. To &s;ay that any people are
<PB N="227" REF="228">not fit for freedom, is to make poverty their choice, and to &s;ay they had rather be loaded with taxes than not. If &s;uch a ca&s;e could be proved, it would equally prove, that tho&s;e who govern are not fit to govern them, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are a part of the &s;ame national ma&s;s.</P>
<P>'But admi&s;&s;ing government <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be changed all over Europe; it certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be done without convul&s;ion or revenge. It is not worth making changes or revolations, unle&s;s it be for &s;o ne great national benefit; and when this &s;hall appear to a nation, the danger will be, as in America and France, to tho&s;e who oppo&s;e.'</P>
<P>Speaking of the expectations to be formed from the prevailing bias towards revolutions in different nations, our author of &s;erves, P. 4.</P>
<P>'As revolutions have begun, (and as the proba|bility is always greater again&s;t a thing beginning than of proceeding after it has begun), it is natural to expect that other revolutions will follow. The amazing and &s;till encrea&s;ing expences with which old governments are conducted, the numerous wars they engage in or provoke, the embarra&s;&s;ments they throw in the way of univer&s;al civilization and commerce, and the oppre&s;&s;ion and u&s;urpation they act at home have wearied out the patience, and exhau&s;ted the property of the world. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, and with the examples already exi&s;t|ing, revolutions are to be looked for. They are become &s;ubjects of univer&s;al conver&s;ation, and may be con&s;idered as the <HI>Order of the day.</HI></P>
<P>'If &s;y&s;tems of government can be introduced, le&s;s expen&s;ive, and more productive of general happine&s;s, than tho&s;e which have exi&s;ted, all at|tempts to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s will in the end be fruitle&s;s. Rea&s;on, like time, will make its own way, and prejudice will fall in a combat with in|tere&s;t. If univer&s;al peace, civilization, and com|merce, are ever to be the happy lot of man, it
<PB N="228" REF="229">cannot be accompli&s;hed but by a revolution in the &s;y&s;tem of governments. All the monarchical go|vernments are military. War is their trade, plun|der and revenue their objects. While &s;uch go|vernments continue, peace has not the ab&s;olute &s;ecurity of a day. What is the hi&s;tory of all mo|narchical governments, but a di&s;gu&s;tful picture of human wretchedne&s;s, and the accidental re&s;pite of a few years repo&s;e? Wearied with war, and tired with human butchery, they &s;at down to re&s;t, and called it peace. This certainly is not the con|dition that Heaven intended for man; and if <HI>this be monarchy,</HI> well might monarchy be reckoned among the &s;ins of the Jews.</P>
<P>'The revolutions which formerly took place in the world, had nothing in them that intere&s;ted the bulk of mankind. They extended only to a change of per&s;ons and mea&s;ures, but not of principles, and ro&s;e or &s;ell among the common transactions of the moment. What we now behold, may not impro|perly be called a <HI>"counter revolution"</HI> Conque&s;t and tyranny, at &s;ome early period, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed man of his rights, and he is now recovering them. And as the tide of all human affairs has its ebb and flow in directions contrary to each other, &s;o al&s;o is it in this. Government &s;ounded on a <HI>moral theory, on a &s;y&s;tem of univer&s;al peace, on the indefea|&s;ible hereditary Rights of Man,</HI> is now revolving from we&s;t to ea&s;t, by a &s;tronger impul&s;e than the government of the &s;word revolved from ea&s;t to we&s;t. It intere&s;ts not particular individuals, but nations, in its progre&s;s, and promi&s;es a new aera to the human race.'</P>
<P>This work is divided into five chapters, pre&s;ent|ing remarks on &s;ociety and civilization&mdash;on the origin of the pre&s;ent old Governments (among the old governments comes poor old England)&mdash;on the old and new &s;y&s;tems of governments&mdash;on con&s;titu|tions&mdash;
<PB N="229" REF="230">ways and means of improving the condition of Europe.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the chapter on civilization, we cannot help expre&s;&s;ing our admiration of many re|marks, which betray great political capacity, and much originality of thought. Mr. Paine &s;uppo&s;es, from the intere&s;t men have in &s;ociety, that the in|&s;tances in which a formal government has any real benefit are few, and that the more perfect civili|zation is, the &s;e&s;s occa&s;ion there is for government. Our author ob&s;erves, P. 11.</P>
<P>'If we look back to the riots and tumults, which at various times have happened in England, we &s;hall find, that they did not proceed from the want of a government, but that government was it&s;elf the generating cau&s;e; in&s;tead of con&s;olidating &s;o|ciety, it divided it: it deprived it of its natural cohe&s;ion, aud engendered di&s;contents and di&s;orders, which otherwi&s;e would not have exi&s;ted. In tho&s;e a&s;&s;ociations which men promi&s;cuou&s;ly form for the purpo&s;e of trade, or of any concern, in which government is totally out of the que&s;tion, and in which they act merely on the principles of &s;ociety, we &s;ee how naturally the various parties unite; and this &s;hews, by compari&s;on, that go|vernments, &s;o far from being always the cau&s;e or means of order, are often the de&s;truction of it. The riots of 1780 had no other &s;ource than the re|mains of tho&s;e prejudices, which the government it&s;elf had encouraged. But with re&s;pect to En|gland there are al&s;o other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>'Exce&s;s and inequality of taxation, however di&s;gui&s;ed in the means, never fail to appear in their effects. As a great ma&s;s of the community are thrown hereby into poverty and di&s;content, they are con&s;tantly on the brink of commotion; and deprived, as they unfortunately are, of the means of information are ea&s;ily heated to outrage. What|ever the apparent cau&s;e of any riots may be, the
<PB N="230" REF="231">real one is always want of happine&s;s. It &s;hews that &s;omething is wrong in the &s;y&s;tem of govern|men, that injures the felicity by which &s;ociety is to be pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the origin of the old governments, Mr. P. traces monarchy to a banditti of Ruffians! Do but hear him! p. 15.</P>
<P>'It is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch governments as have hitherto exi&s;ted in the world, could have com|menced by any other means than a total violation of every principle &s;acred and moral. The ob&s;cu|rity in which the origin of all the pre&s;ent old go|vernments is buried, implies the iniquity and di&s;|grace with which they began. The origin of the pre&s;ent government of America and France will ever be remembered, becau&s;e it is honourable to record it; but with re&s;pect to the re&s;t, even flat|tery has con&s;igned them to the tomb of time, with|out an in&s;piration.</P>
<P>'It could have been no difficult thing in the early and &s;olitary ages of the world, while the chief employment of men was that of attending flocks and herds, for a banditti of ruffians to over|run a country, and lay it under contributions. Their power being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, the chief of the band contrived to lo&s;e the name of robber in that of monarch; and hence the origin of monar|chy and kings.</P>
<P>'The origin of the government of England, &s;o far as relates to what is called its line of monarchy, being one of the late&s;t, is perhaps the be&s;t record|ed. The hatred which the Norman inva&s;ion and tyranny begat, mu&s;t have been deeply rooted in the nation, to have outlived the contrivance to obliterate it. Though not a courtier will talk of the curfeu bell, not a village in England has for|gotten it.'</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks, however, though they will ap|ply
<PB N="231" REF="232">to mo&s;t of the monarchies which have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, will certainly not apply to all,</P>
<P>When treating on the origin of the old and new &s;y&s;tems of government, our author makes the fol|lowing &s;evere reflections on hereditary govern|ment, p. 21.</P>
<P>'Government ought to be a thing always in full maturity. It ought to be &s;o con&s;tructed as to be &s;uperior to all the accidents to which individual man is &s;ubject; and therefore, hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on, by being <HI>&s;ubject to them all,</HI> is the mo&s;t irregu|lar and imperfect of all the &s;y&s;tems of government.</P>
<P>'We have heard the <HI>Rights of Man</HI> called a <HI>le|telling</HI> &s;y&s;tem; but the only &s;y&s;tem to which the word <HI>levelling</HI> is truly applicable, is the hereditary monarchical &s;y&s;tem. It is a &s;y&s;tem of <HI>mental level|ling.</HI> It indi&s;criminately admits every &s;pecies of character to the &s;ame authority. Vice and virtue. ignorance and wi&s;dom, in &s;hort, every quality, good or bad, is put on the &s;ame level. Kings &s;ucceed each other, not as ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ionals, but as ani|mals. It &s;ignifies not what their mental or moral characters are. Can we then be &s;urprited at the abject &s;tate of the human mind in monarchial countries, when the government it&s;elf is formed on &s;uch an abject levelling &s;y&s;tem?&mdash;It has no fixed character. To day it is one thing; to-morrow it is &s;omething el&s;e. It changes with the temper of every &s;ucceeding individual, and is &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bject to all the varieties of eaeh. It is government through the medium of pa&s;&s;ions and accident. It appears under all the various characters of childhood, de|crepitude, dotage, a thing at nur&s;e, in leading-&s;trings, or in crutches. It rever&s;es the whole&s;ome order of nature. It occa&s;ionally puts children over men, and the conceits of non-age over wi&s;|dom and experience. In &s;hort, we cannot con|ceive a more ridiculous figure of government, than hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in all its ca&s;es pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>'Could it be made a degree in nature, or an
<PB N="232" REF="233">adict regi&s;tered in heaven, and man could know in that virtue and wi&s;dom &s;hould invariably appertain to hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the objections to it would be removed; but when we &s;ee that nature acts as if &s;he di&s;owned and &s;ported with the hereditary &s;y&s;tem: that the mental characters of &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in all countries, are below the average of human under&s;tanding; that one is a tyrant, another an ideot, a third in&s;ane, and &s;ome all three together, it is impo&s;&s;ible to attach confidence to it, when rea&s;on in man has power to act.'</P>
<P>In &s;peaking on the tendency of elective govern|ments, many political writers have &s;poken of them as the cau&s;e of civil wars. Mr. Paine on the other hand contends, that civil wars, which have origi|nated from conte&s;ted hereditary claims, are more numerous, and have been more dreadful, and of longer continuance, than tho&s;e which have been occa&s;ioned by elective governments. Mr. Paine's views here corre&s;pond to the reflections made on the &s;ame &s;ubject by the illu&s;trious &s;ufferer Algernon Sidney.</P>
<P>One hardly can help &s;miling at the following remark, p. 36.</P>
<P>'Whether I have too little &s;en&s;e to &s;ee, or too much to be impo&s;ed upon; whether I have too much or too little pride, or of any thing el&s;e, I leave out of the que&s;tion; but certain it is, that what is called monarchy, always appears to me a filly, contemptible thing. I compare it to &s;ome|thing kept behind a curtain, about which there is a great deal of bu&s;tle and fu&s;s, and a wonderful air of &s;eeming &s;olemnity; but when, by any accident, the curtain happens to be opened, and the com|pany &s;ee what it is, they bur&s;t into laughter.'</P>
<P>Whether the remark be true or fal&s;e, we do not determine; <HI>fed ri&s;um teneatis amici?</HI></P>

<PB N="233" REF="234">as we were to &s;mile, we could not avoid being grave. p. 38.</P>
<P>'That monarchy is all a bubble, a mere court artifice to procure money, is evident (at lea&s;t to me), in every character in which it can be viewed. It would be impo&s;&s;ible, on the rational &s;y&s;tem of repre&s;entative government, to make out a bill of expences to &s;uch an enormous amount as this de|ception admits. Government is not of it&s;elf a very chargeable in&s;titution. The whole expence of the federal government of America, founded, as I have already &s;aid, on the &s;y&s;tem of repre&s;en|tation, and extending over a country ten times as large as England, is but &s;ix hundred thou&s;and dol|lars, or one hundred and thirty-five thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>'I pre&s;ume, that no man in his &s;ober &s;en&s;es, will compare the character of any of the kings of Eu|rope with that of General Wa&s;hington. Yet, in France, and al&s;o in England, the expence of the civil li&s;t only, for the &s;upport of one man, is eight times greater than the whole expence of the federal government in America. To a&s;&s;ign a rea|&s;on for this, appears almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible. The ge|nerality of people in America, e&s;pecially the poor, are more able to pay taxes, than the generality of people either in France or England.</P>
<P>'But the ca&s;e is, that the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem diffu&s;es &s;uch a body of knowledge throughout a nation, on the &s;ubject of government, as to explode ignorance, and preclude impo&s;ition. The craft of courts cannot be acted on that ground. There is no place for my&s;tery; no where for it to begin. Tho&s;e who are not in the repre&s;entation, know as much of the nature of bu&s;ine&s;s as tho&s;e who are. An affectation of my&s;terious importance would there be &s;couted. Nations can have no, &s;ecrets; and the &s;ecrets of courts, like tho&s;e of individuals, are always their defects.'</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235">'Our author, after &s;tating the manner in which America proceeded in forming her con&s;titution, &s;till in&s;i&s;ts on what he had formerly advanced, viz. that England has no con&s;titution. Whether truly or no, we leave others to decide. We will ju&s;t quote a word or two on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>'In England, (p. 50. 51.) it is not difficult to perceive that every thing has a con&s;titution, except the nation. Every &s;ociety and a&s;&s;ociation that is e&s;tabli&s;hed, fir&s;t agreed upon a number of original articles, dige&s;ted into form, which are its con&s;ti|tution. It then appointed its officers, who&s;e pow|ers and authorities are de&s;eribed in that con&s;tituti|on, and the government of that &s;ociety then com|menced. Tho&s;e officers, by whatever name they are called, have no authority to add to, alter, or abridge the original articles. It is only to the con|&s;tituting power that this right belongs.</P>
<P>'From the want of under&s;tanding the difference between a con&s;titution and a government, Dr. John&s;on, and all writers of his de&s;cription, have always bewildered them&s;elves. They could not but perceive, that there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a <HI>con|trouling</HI> power exi&s;ting &s;omewhere, and they placed this power in the di&s;cretion of the per&s;ons exer|ci&s;ing the government, in&s;tead of placing it in a con&s;titution formed by the nation. When it is in a con&s;titution, it has the nation for its &s;upport, and the natural and the political countrouling powers are together. The laws which are enacted by go|vernments, countroul men only as individuals, but the nation, through its con&s;titution, countrouls the whole government, and has a natural ability &s;o to do. The final controuling power, therefore, and the original con&s;tituting power, are one and the &s;ame power.'</P>
<P>Having, as he thinks, demoli&s;hed the doctrine of an 'Engli&s;h con&s;titution,' he then drops a word or two on precedents, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="236">'In numerous in&s;tances, he &s;ays (P. 58.) the precedent ought to operate as a warning, and not as an example, and requires to be &s;hunned in&s;tead of imitated; but in&s;tead of this, precedents are ta|ken in the lump, and put at once for con&s;titution and for law.</P>
<P>'Either the doctrine of precedents is policy to keep a man in a &s;tate of ignorance or is it a prac|tical confe&s;&s;ion that wi&s;dom degenerates in govern|ments, as governments increa&s;e in age, and can only hobble along by the &s;tilts and crutches of precedents. How is it that the &s;ame per&s;ons who would proudly be thought wi&s;er than their prede|ce&s;&s;ors, appear at the &s;ame time only as the gho&s;ts of departed wi&s;dom? How &s;trangely is antiquity treated! To an&s;wer &s;ome purpo&s;es it is &s;poken of as the times of darkne&s;s and ignorance, and to an|&s;wer others, it is put for the light of the world.</P>
<P>'If the doctrine of precedents is to be followed, the expences of government need not continue the &s;ame. Why pay men extravagantly, who have but little to do? If every thing that can happen is already in precedent, legi&s;lation is at an end, and precedent, like a dictionary, determines every ca&s;e. Either, therefore, government has arrived at its dotage, and requires to be renovated, or all the occa&s;ions for exerci&s;ing its wi&s;dom have oc|curred.'</P>

<P>'When extraordinary power and extraordinary pay are allotted to any individnal in a government, he becomes the center, round which every kind of corruption generates and forms. Give to any man a million a year, and add thereto the power of creating and di&s;po&s;ing of places, at the expence of a country, and the liberties of that country are no longer &s;ecure. What is called the &s;plendor of a throne is no other than the corruption of the &s;tate. It is made up of a band &ograve;f para&s;ites, living in luxurious indolence, out of the public taxes.</P>
<P>'When once &s;uch a vicious &s;y&s;tem is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, it becomes the guard and protection of all in|ferior abu&s;es. The man who is in the receipt of a million a year, is the la&s;t per&s;on to promote a &s;pirit of reform, le&s;t, in the event, it &s;hould reach to him&s;elf. It is always his intere&s;t to defend in|ferior abu&s;es, as &s;o many out-works to protect the citadel; and in this &s;pecies of political fortification, all the parts have &s;uch a common dependence that it is never to be expected they will attack each other <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>'It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to touch on any &s;ubject that will not &s;ugge&s;t an allu&s;ion to &s;ome corruption in governments. The &s;imile of "fortifications," unfortunately involves with it a circum&s;tance, which is directly in point with the matter above alluded to.</P>
<P>'Among the numerous in&s;tances of abu&s;e which have been acted or protected by governments, ancient or modern, there is not a greater than that of quartering a man and his heirs upon the public, to be maintained at its expence.</P>
<P>'Humanity dictates a provi&s;ion for the poor; but by what right, moral or political, does any government a&s;&s;ume to &s;ay, that the per&s;on called the Duke of Richmond, &s;hall he maintained by the public? Yet, if common report is true, not a beggar in London can purcha&s;e his wretched pittance of coal, without paying towards the civil li&s;t of the Duke of Richmond. Were the whole produce of this impo&s;ition but a &s;hilling a year, the iniquitous principle would be &s;till the &s;ame; but when it amounts, as it is &s;aid to do, to not le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and pounds per ann. the enormity is too &s;erious to be permitted to remain.&mdash;This is one of the effects of monarchy and ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>'In &s;tating this ca&s;e, I am led by no per&s;onal di&s;like. Though I think it mean in any man to live upon the public, the vice ori|ginates in the government; and &s;o general is it become, that whe|ther the parties are in the mini&s;try or in the oppo&s;ition, it makes no difference: they are &s;ure of the guarantee of each other.'</P></NOTE></P>

<P><PB N="238" REF="239">In remarking on what Mr. Burke &s;aid relative to the Hou&s;e of Peers, the following fact is produ|ced, which Mr. Paine calls a fact not to be paral|leled in the hi&s;tory of taxation.</P>
<P>P. 100. 'Notwith&s;tanding taxes have encrea&s;ed and multiplied upon every article of common con&s;ump|tion, the land tax, which more particularly affects this 'pillar' has dimini&s;hed. In 1788, the amount of the land-tax was 1,950,000<HI>l.</HI> which is half a million le&s;s than it produced almo&s;t an hundred years ago <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">'See Sir John Sinclair's Hi&s;tory of the Revenue.' The land tax in 1646 was 2,473,499l.</NOTE>, notwith&s;tanding the rentals are in many in&s;tances doubled &s;ince that period.</P>
<P>'Before the coming of the Hanoverians, the taxes were divided in nearly &egrave;qual proportions between the land and articles of con&s;umption, the land bearing rather the large&s;t &s;hare; but &s;ince that aera, nearly thirteen millions annually of new taxes have been thrown upon con&s;umption. The con|&s;equence of which has been a con&s;tant encrea&s;e in the number and wretchedne&s;s of the poor, and in the amount of the poor-rates. Yet here again the burthens does not fall in equal proportions on the ari&s;tocracy with the re&s;t of the community. Their re&s;idences, whether in town or country, are not mixed with the habitations of the poor. They live apart from di&s;tre&s;s, and the expence of reliev|ing it. It is in manufacturing towns and labouring villages that tho&s;e burthens pre&s;s the heavie&s;t; in many of which it is one cla&s;s of poor &s;upport|ing another.</P>
<P>'Several of the mo&s;t heavy and productive taxes are &s;o contrived, as to give an exemption to this pillar, thus &s;tanding in its own defence. The tax upon beer brewed for &s;ale does not affect the ari&s;tocracy, who brew their own beer free of this duty. It falls only on tho&s;e who have not conveni|ency or ability to brew, and who mu&s;t purcha&s;e it in
<PB N="239" REF="240">&s;mall quantities. But what will mankind think of the ju&s;tice of taxation, when they know, that this tax alone, from which the ari&s;tocracy are from circum|&s;tances exempt, is nearly equal to the whole of the land-tax, being in the year 1788, and it is not le&s;s now, than 1, 666, 152<HI>l.</HI> and with its proportion of the taxes on malt and hops, it exceeds it.&mdash;That a &s;ingle article, thus partially con&s;umed, and that chiefly by the working part, &s;hould be &s;ubject to a tax, equal to that on the whole rental of a nation, is, perhaps, a fact not to be parelleled in the hi&s;tories of re|venues.'</P>
<P>'The taxes levied by William the Conqueror, beginning in the year 1066, were 400,000<HI>l.</HI>&mdash;In the year 1466 they had decrea&s;ed to 100,000.

<P>Mr. Paine &s;uppo&s;es, from a variety of circum|&s;tances taken together, that the annual expenditure might be fixed at 1,500,000<HI>l.</HI> The &s;urplus of more than 6,000,000<HI>l.</HI> out of the pre&s;ent current expen|ces, he &s;uppo&s;es, might be di&s;po&s;ed of as follows. The poor rates might be aboli&s;hed, and in lieu of them a remi&s;&s;ion of taxes might be made to the poor of double the amount of tho&s;e rates out of the &s;urplus taxes. By which means the poor would be benefited 20,000<HI>l.</HI> and the hou&s;ekeepers 20,000<HI>l</HI> This remi&s;&s;ion he &s;uppo&s;es to be applied to the edu|cation of poor children, and the &s;upport of old people pa&s;t their labour; to the education of chil|dren of a cla&s;s of people, who, though not &s;trictly
<PB N="240" REF="241">poor, are incapable of giving their children educa|tion: to the relief of workmen (making the demand) on the birth of a child, and of every new married couple claiming in like manner; and 20.000<HI>l.</HI> to defray the funeral expences of per&s;ons who, travelling for work, die at a di&s;tance from their friends; 20,000<HI>l.</HI> to what he calls 'a world of little ca&s;es,' ari&s;ing particularly in London. To make up the deficiency, nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply the demand of the&s;e ca&s;es, he propo&s;es to add 20,000<HI>l.</HI> the tax laid on coals in London, '&s;o iniquitou&s;ly and wantonly applied to the &s;upport of the Duke of Richmond.

<HEAD>ERSKINE's DEFENCE OF PAINE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">AND THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS, <HI>Continued from Page</HI> 182, Vol. II.</HEAD>
<P>THE univer&s;al God of nature,&mdash;the Saviour of mankind,&mdash;the fountain of all light, who came to pluck the world from eternal darkne&s;s, expired upon a cro&s;s, the &s;coff of infidel &s;corn; and his ble&s;&s;ed apo&s;tles followed him in the train of Martyrs. When he came in the fle&s;h, he might have come like the Mahometan prophet, as a pow|erful &s;overeign, and propagated that religion with an unconquerable &s;word, which even now, after the lap&s;e of ages, is but &s;lowly moving, under the influence of rea&s;on, over the face of the earth: But &s;uch a proce&s;s would have been incon&s;i&s;tent with his mi&s;&s;ion, which was to confound the pride, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the univer&s;al rights of men; he came therefore in that lowly &s;tate which is repre|&s;ented
<PB N="243" REF="244">in the go&s;pel, and preached his con&s;olations to the poor.</P>
<P>When the foundation of this religion was di&s;|covered to be invulnerable and immortal, we had political power taking the church into partner&s;hip; thus began the corruptions both of religion and civil power, and, hand in hand together, what havock have they not made in the world; ruling by ignorance and the per&s;ecution of truth; but this very per&s;ecution only ha&s;tened the revival of letters and liberty, which was to de&s;troy the one, and to rai&s;e up the other. Nay, you will find, that in the exact proportion that knowledge and learning have been beat down and fettered, they have de&s;troyed the governments that bound them. The court of Star-chamber, the fir&s;t re&s;triction of the pre&s;s in England, was erected, previous to all the great changes in the con&s;titution. From that moment no man could legally write without an imprimatur from the &s;tate; but truth and freedom found their way with greater force through &s;ecret channels, and the unhappy Charles, unwarned by a free pre&s;s, was brought to an ignominious death.</P>
<P>When men can freely communicate their thoughts and their &s;ufferings, real or imaginary, their pa&s;|&s;ions &s;pend them&s;elves in air, like gunpowder &s;cat|tered upon the &s;urface; but pent up by terrors, they work unfeen, like &s;ubterraneous fire, bur&s;t forth in earthquake, and de&s;troy every thing in their cour&s;e.

<P>The u&s;urper, Cromwell, pur&s;ued the &s;ame &s;y&s;|tem of re&s;traint in &s;upport of his government, and the end of it &s;peedily followed.</P>
<P>At the re&s;toration of Charles the Second, the Star-chamber ordinance of 1637, was worked up into an act of Parliament, and was followed up during that reign, and the &s;hort one that followed

If indeed, I were to refer to ob&s;cure authors, I might be an|&s;wered, that my very authorities were libels, in|&s;tead of ju&s;tifications or examples; but this cannot be &s;aid with effect of great men, who&s;e works are cla&s;&s;ics in our language, taught in our &s;chools, and printed under the eye of government.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;hall begin with the poet Milton, a great authority in all learning.&mdash;It may be &s;aid, indeed, he was a republican, but that would only prove that REPUBLICANISM IS NOT INCOMPATI|BLE WITH VIRTUE; it may be &s;aid too, that the work which I cite was written again&s;t previous licencing, which is not contended for to-day. But in my opinion, if every work is to be adjudged a libel, which is adver&s;e to the wi&s;hes of govern|ment, or to the opinions of tho&s;e who may try it, the revival of a licencer would be a &s;ecurity to the public: For, if I pre&s;ent my book to a magi&s;|trate appointed by law, if he rejects it, I have
<PB N="245" REF="246">only to forbear from the publication, and in the forbearance I am &s;afe; and he too is an&s;werable for the abu&s;e of his authority. But, upon the argument of to-day, a man mu&s;t print at his peril, without any guide to the principles of judgment, upon which his work may be afterwards pro&s;e|cuted and condemned. Milton's argument there|fore applies, and was meant to apply, to every interruption to writing, which, while they op|pre&s;s the individual, endanger the &s;tate.</P>
<P>"We have them not," &s;ays Milton, <Q>that can be heard of, from any ancient &s;tate, or polity, or church, nor by any &s;tatute left us by our ance&s;|tors, elder or later, nor from the modern cu&s;tom of any reformed city, abroad; but from the mo&s;t antichri&s;tian council, and the mo&s;t tyran|nous inqui&s;ition that ever exi&s;ted. Till then, books were ever as freely admitted into the world as any other birth; <HI>the i&s;&s;ue of the brain was no more &s;tifled than the i&s;&s;ue of the womb.</HI></Q></P>
<Q><P>To the pure all things are pure; not only meats and drinks, but all kind of knowledge, whether good or evil; the knowledge cannot defile, nor con&s;equently the books, if the will and con&s;cience be not defiled.</P>
<P>Bad books &s;erve in many re&s;pects to di&s;cover, to confu&s;e, to forewarn, and to illu&s;trate. Where|of what better witne&s;s can we expect I &s;hould produce, than one of your own, now &s;itting in Parliament, the chief of learned men reputed in this land, <HI>Mr, Selden;</HI> who&s;e volume of natural and national laws proves, not only by great au|thorities brought together, but by exqui&s;ite rea&s;ons and theorems, almo&s;t mathematically demon&s;trative, that all opinions. yea errors, known, read, and collated, are of main &s;ervice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance toward the &s;peedy attainment of what is true&s;t.</P>
<P>Opinions and under&s;tanding are not &s;uch
<PB N="246" REF="247">wares as to be monopolized and traded in by tickets and &s;tatutes, and &s;tandards. We mu&s;t not think to make a &s;taple commodity of all the knowledge in the land, to mark and licence it, like our broad-cloth, and our wool-packs.</P>
<P>Nor is it to the common people le&s;s than a reproach; for if we be &s;o jealous over them, that we cannot tru&s;t them with an Engli&s;h pamphlet, what do we but cen&s;ure them, for a giddy, vicious, and ungrounded people; in &s;uch a &s;ick and weak e&s;tate of faith and di&s;cretion, as to be able to take nothing down but through the pipe of a licencer. That this is care or love of them we cannot pretend.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e corruptions which it &s;eeks to prevent, break in fa&s;ter at doors which cannot be &s;hut.</P>
<P>To prevent men thinking and acting for them&s;elves, by re&s;traints on the pre&s;s, is like to the exploits of the gallant man, who, thought to pound up the crows by &s;hutting his park gate.</P>
<P>This ob&s;tructing violence meets for the mo&s;t part with an event, utterly oppo&s;ite to the end which it drives at: in&s;tead of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing books, it rai&s;es them and inve&s;ts them with a reputati|on: the puni&s;hment of wits enhances their au|thority, &s;aith the vi&s;count St. Albans; and a forbidden writing is thought to be a certain &s;park of truth, that flies up in the face of them who &s;eek to tread it out.</P></Q>
<P>He then adverts to his vi&s;it to the famous Gali|leo, whom he found and vi&s;ited in the inqui&s;ition, <Q>for not thinking in a&s;tronomy with the Franci&s;|can and Dominican monks.</Q> And what event ought more deeply to intere&s;t and affect us. The very laws of nature were to bend under the rod of a licencer; this illu&s;trious a&s;tronomer ended his life within the bars of a pri&s;on, becau&s;e, in &s;eeing the pha&s;es of Venus through his newly invented
<PB N="247" REF="248">tele&s;cope, he pronounced, that &s;he &s;hone with borrowed light, and from the &s;un as the center: that &s;un which now inhabits it upon the foundati|on of mathematical truth, which enables us to travel the pathle&s;s ocean, and to carry our line and rule among&s;t other worlds, which but for Galileo we had never known, perhaps even to the rece&s;|&s;es of an infinite and immortal God.</P>
<P>Milton then, in the mo&s;t eloquent addre&s;s to the parliament, puts the Liberty of the Pre&s;s on its true and mo&s;t honourable foundation. <Q>Believe it Lords and Commons, they who coun&s;el ye to &s;uch a &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of books, do as good as bid you &s;uppre&s;s your&s;elves; and I will &s;oon &s;hew how.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If it be de&s;ired to know the immediate cau&s;e of all this free writing and free &s;peaking, there cannot be a&s;&s;igned a truer than your own mild, and free, and humane government; it is the liberty, lords and commons, which your own valourous and happy coun&s;els have purcha&s;ed us; liberty which is the nur&s;e of all great wits: this is that which hath rarified and enlightened our &s;pirits like the influence of Heaven; this is that which hath enfranchi&s;ed, enlarged and lifted up our apprehen&s;ions, de|grees above them&s;elves. Ye cannot make us now le&s;s able, le&s;s knowing, le&s;s eagerly pur&s;u|ing the truth, unle&s;s ye fir&s;t make your&s;elves, that made us &s;o le&s;s the lovers le&s;s the founders of our true liberty. We can grow ignorant again, bruti&s;h formal and &s;lavi&s;h, as ye found us; but ye then mu&s;t become that which ye cannot be, oppre&s;&s;ive, arbitrary and tyrannous, as they were from whom ye freed us. That our hearts are now more capacious, our thoughts now more erected to the &s;earch and expectation of greate&s;t and exacte&s;t things, is the i&s;&s;ue of your own virtue propagated in us. Give me
<PB N="248" REF="249">the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to con&s;cience, above all liber|ties.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, I will now refer you to another au|thor, who&s;e opinion you may think more in point, as having lived in our own times, and as holding the highe&s;t monarchical principles of government. I &s;peak of Mr. Hume, who, neverthele&s;s, con|&s;iders, that this liberty of the pre&s;s extends not only to ab&s;tract &s;peculation, but to keep the public on their guard again&s;t all the acts of their govern|ment.</P>
<P>After &s;hewing the advantages of a monarchy to public freedom, provided it is duly controlled and watched by the popular part of the con&s;titution; lie &s;ays, <Q>The&s;e principles account for the great liberty of the pre&s;s in the&s;e kingdoms, beyond what is indulged in any other government. It is apprehended, that arbitrary power would &s;teal in upon us, were we not careful to prevent its progre&s;s, and were there not an ea&s;y method of conveying the alarm from one end of the kingdom to the other. <HI>The &s;pirit of the people mu&s;t frequently be rou&s;ed, in order to curb the ambi|tion of the court;</HI> and the dread of rou&s;ing this &s;pirit mu&s;t be employed to prevent that ambition. Nothing is &s;o effectual to this purpo&s;e, as the liberty of the pre&s;s, by which all the learning, wit, and genius of the nation, may be employed on the &s;ide of freedom; and every one be ani|mated to its defence. <HI>As long, therefore, as the republican part of our government can maintain it&s;elf again&s;t the monarchical, it will naturally be careful to keep the pre&s;s open, as of importance to its own pre&s;ervation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There is another authority co-temporary with the la&s;t, a &s;plendid &s;peaker in the upper Hou&s;e of Parliament, and who held during mo&s;t of his time high offices under the king; I &s;peak of the Earl
<PB N="249" REF="250">of Che&s;terfield, who thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the Hou&s;e of Lords:&mdash; <Q>One of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, my lords, we enjoy, is liberty; but every good in this life has its alloy of evil&mdash;licentiou&s;ne&s;s is the alloy of liberty, it is.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Lord Kenyon.</HI> Doctor John&s;on claims to pluck that feather from Lord Che&s;terfield's wing; he &s;peaks, I believe, of the eye of the political body.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Er&s;kine.</HI> Gentlemen, I have heard it &s;aid, that Lord Che&s;terfield borrowed that which I was ju&s;t about to &s;tate, and which his lord&s;hip has an|ticipated.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Kenyon.</HI> That every &s;peech which did Lord Che&s;terfield &s;o much honour, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been written by Doctor John&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Er&s;kine.</HI> Gentlemen, I believe it was &s;o, and I am much obliged to his lord&s;hip for giving me a far higher authority for my doctrine. For though Lord Che&s;terfield was a man of great ingenuity and wit, he was undoubtedly far inferior in learn|ing and in monarchical opinion, to the celebrated writer to whom my lord has now delivered the work by his authority. Doctor John&s;on then &s;ays, <Q>One of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings a people, my lords, can enjoy, is liberty; but every good in this life has its alloy of evil: Licentiou&s;ne&s;s is the alloy of liberty; it is an ebullition, and excre&s;cence; it is a &s;peck upon the eye of the political body, which I can never touch but with a gentle, with trembling hand, left I de&s;troy the body, le&s;t I injure the eye upon which it is apt to appear.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is &s;uch a connection between licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s and liberty, that it is not ea&s;y to cor|rect the one, without dangerou&s;ly wounding the other; it is extremely hard to di&s;tingui&s;h the true limit between them; like a changeable &s;ilk, we can ea&s;ily &s;ee there are two different colours, but we cannot ea&s;ily di&s;cover where
<PB N="250" REF="251">the one ends, or where the other begins.</Q></P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I cannot help agreeing with this learn|ed author. The da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ger of touching the pre&s;s is the difficulty of marking its limits. My learned friend, who has ju&s;t gone out of court, has drawn no line, and unfolded no principle. He has not told us, if this book is condemned, what book may be written. If I may not write again&s;t the exi&s;tence of monarchy, and recommend a repub|lic, may I write again&s;t any part of the govern|ment? May I &s;ay that we &s;hould be better without a Hou&s;e of Lords, or a Hou&s;e of Commons, or a Court of Chancery, or any other given part of our e&s;tabli&s;hment? Or if, as has been hinted, a work may become libellous for &s;tating even regal mat|ter with &s;arca&s;tic phra&s;e, the difficulty becomes the greater, and the liberty of the pre&s;s more im|po&s;&s;ible to define.</P>
<P>The &s;ame author pur&s;uing the &s;ubject, and &s;peaking of the fall of Roman liberty, &s;ays, <Q>But this &s;ort of liberty came &s;oon after to be called licentiou&s;ne&s;s; for we are told that Augu&s;tus, after having e&s;tabli&s;hed his empire, re&s;tored or|der in Rome, by re&s;training licentiou&s;ne&s;s. God forbid we &s;hould in this country have order re|&s;tored, or licentiou&s;ne&s;s re&s;trained, at &s;o dear a rate as the people of Rome paid for it to Au|gu&s;tus.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let us con&s;ider, my lords. that arbitrary pow|er has &s;eldom, or never been introduced into any country at once. It mu&s;t be introduced by &s;low degrees, and 2s is were &s;tep by &s;tep, le&s;t the people &s;hould &s;ee its approach. The bar|riers and fences of the people's liberty, mu&s;t be plucked one by one, and &s;ome plau&s;ible preten|ces mu&s;t be found for removing or hoodwink|ing, one after another, tho&s;e centries who are po&s;ted by the con&s;titution of a free country, for warning the people of their danger. When
<PB N="251" REF="252">the&s;e preparatory &s;teps are once made, the peo|ple may then, indeed, with regret, &s;ee &s;lavery and arbitrary power making long &s;trides over their land; but it will be too late to think of preventing or avoiding the impending ruin.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The &s;tage, my lords, and the pre&s;s, are two of our out-&s;entries; if we remove them, if we hoodwink them, if we throw them in fetters, the enemy may &s;urprize us.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, this &s;ubject was &s;till more lately put in the ju&s;te&s;t and mo&s;t forcible light, by a noble per&s;on high in the magi&s;tracy; and who&s;e mind is not at all turned to the introduction of di&s;order by improper popular exce&s;&s;es: I mean Lord Lough|borough, chief ju&s;tice of the court of common pleas. I believe I can an&s;wer for the correctne&s;s of my note, which I &s;hall follow up with the opinion of another member of the Lord's Hou&s;e of Parlia|ment; the pre&s;ent Earl of Stanhope; or rather, I &s;hall take Lord Stanhope fir&s;t, as his lord&s;hip in|troduces the &s;ubject by adverting to this argument of Lord Loughborough's. "If," &s;ays his lord&s;hip, <Q>our boa&s;ted liberty of the pre&s;s, were to con&s;i&s;t only in the liberty to write in prai&s;e of the con&s;titution, this is a liberty enjoyed under many arbitrary governments. I &s;uppo&s;e it would not be deemed quite an unpardonable offence, even by the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, if any man were to take into his head to write a panegvric upon the Ru&s;&s;ian form of government. Such a liber|ty as that might therefore properly be termed, <HI>the Ru&s;&s;ian liberty of the pre&s;s.</HI> But <HI>the Engli&s;h li|berty of the pre&s;s,</HI> is of a very different de&s;cripti|on; for, by the law of England, it is not pro|hibited to publi&s;h &s;peculative works upon the con&s;titution, <HI>whether they contain prai&s;e or cen&s;ure:</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Lord Stanhope's defence of the libel bill.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ee therefore, as far as the general princi|ple goes, I am &s;upported by the opinion of Lord
<PB N="252" REF="253">Stanhope, for otherwi&s;e the noble lord has written a libel him&s;elf, by exciting other people to write <HI>whatever they may think,</HI> be it good or evil, of the con&s;titution of the country. As to the other high authority, Lord Loughborough, I will read what applies to this &s;ubject&mdash;'Every man' &s;aid Lord Loughbourough, <Q>may publi&s;h at his di&s;cretion his opinions concerning forms and &s;y&s;tems of go|vernment.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If they be wi&s;e and enlightening, the world will gain by them; if they be weak and ab&s;urd, they will be laughed at and forgotten, and, if they be <HI>bona &s;ide,</HI> they cannot be criminal, how|ever erroneous. On the other hand, the pur|po&s;e and the direction may give a different turn to writings, who&s;e common con&s;truction is harm|le&s;s, or even meritorious. Suppo&s;e men, a&s;|&s;embled in di&s;turbance of the peace, to pull down mills or turnpikes, or to do any other mi&s;chief, and that a mi&s;chievous per&s;on &s;hould di&s;per&s;e among them, an excitation to the planned mi&s;chief known to be both writer and reader, <HI>To your tents, O I&s;rael!</HI> that publication would be criminal. But how criminal? not as a libel, not as an ab&s;tract writing, but as an act; and the act being the crime <HI>it mu&s;t be &s;tated as af act ex|trinfic on the record:</HI> for, otherwi&s;e, a court of error could have no juri&s;diction, but over the natural con&s;truction of the writing: nor would the defendant have any notice of &s;uch matter at the trial, without a charge on the record. To give the jury cognizance of any matter beyond the con&s;truction of the writing, the averrment, &s;hould be in the ca&s;e as I have in&s;tanced, that certain per&s;ons were, as I have de&s;cribed, a&s;|&s;embled; and that the publi&s;her, intending to execute the&s;e per&s;ons &s;o a&s;&s;embled, wrote <HI>&s;o and &s;o.</HI> Here the crime is complete, and con&s;i&s;ts in an overt-act of wickedne&s;s evidenced by a writ|ing.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="254">In an&s;wer to all the&s;e authorities, the attorney general may &s;ay, that, if Mr Paine had written his ob&s;ervations with the views of tho&s;e high per|&s;ons and under their circum&s;tances, he would be protected and acquitted: to which I can only an|&s;wer, that no facts or circum&s;tances attending his work are either charged or proved; that you have no juri&s;diction whatever but over the natural con|&s;truction of the work before you, and that I am therefore brought without a flaw in the deduction to the pa&s;&s;ages which are the particular &s;ubject of complaint.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am come now to ob&s;erve on the pa&s;&s;ages &s;elected by the information; and with re|gard to the fir&s;t I &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of it in a moment.</P>
<P><Q>All <HI>hereditary</HI> government is in its nature ty|ranny. An hereditable crown, or an heredita|ble throne, or by what other fanciful name &s;uch things may be called, have no other &s;ignificant explination than that mankind, are heredita|ble <HI>property.</HI> To inherit a government, is to <HI>inherit the people,</HI> as if they were flocks and herds.</Q></P>
<P>And is it to be endured, &s;ays the attorney gene|ral, that the people of this country are to be told that they are driven like oxen or &s;heep? Certainly not. I am of opinion that a more dangerous doctrine cannot be in&s;tilled into the people of England. But who in&s;tills &s;uch a doctrine? I deny it is in&s;tilled by Paine. For when he main|tains that hereditary monarchy inherits a people like flocks and herds, it is clear from the context <HI>(which is kept out of view,)</HI> that he is combating the propo&s;ition in Mr. Burke's book, which a&s;&s;erts, that the hereditary monarchy of England is fa&s;t|ened upon the people of England by indi&s;&s;oluble compact. Mr. Paine, on the contrary, a&s;&s;erts the King of England te be the <HI>magi&s;trate of the people,</HI> exi&s;ting by their con&s;ent, which is utterly incom|patable
<PB N="254" REF="255">with their being driven like herds His argument, therefore, is this, and it retorts on his adver&s;ary: he &s;ays, &s;uch a king as you repre&s;ent the King of England to be, inheriting the people by virtue of conque&s;t, or of &s;ome compact, which, having once exi&s;ted, cannot be di&s;olved while the original terms of it are kept, <HI>is an inheritance like flocks and herds.</HI> But I deny that to be the King of England's title, he is <HI>the magi&s;trate of the people,</HI> and that title I re&s;pect. It is to your own imagi|nary King of England therefore, and not to his maje&s;ty, that your un&s;ounded innuendos apply. It is the monarchs of Ru&s;&s;ia and Pru&s;&s;ia, and all go|vernments fa&s;tened upon unwilling &s;ubjects by hereditary indefea&s;ible titles, that are &s;tigmati&s;ed by Paine, as inheriting the people like flocks. The &s;entence, therefore, mu&s;t either be taken in the pure ab&s;tract, and then it is not only merely &s;pe|culative, but the application of it to our own go|vernment fails altogether, or it mu&s;t be taken con|nected with the matter which con&s;titutes the ap|plication, and then it is Mr. Burke's King of England, and not his maje&s;ty who&s;e title is denied.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s therefore to the next pa&s;&s;age, which ap|pears to be an extraordinary &s;election. It is taken at a leap from page 21, to page 47, and breaks in at the words, "This convention." The &s;entence &s;elected &s;tands thus, <Q>This convention met at phi|ladelphia in May 1787, of which General Wa&s;h|ington was elected pre&s;ident. He was not at that time connected with any of the &s;tate govern|ments, or with congre&s;s. He delivered up his commi&s;&s;ion when the war ended, and &s;ince then had lived a private citizen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The convention went deeply into all the &s;ub|jects, and having after a variety of debate and inve&s;tigation, agreed among them&s;elves upon the &s;everal parts of a federal con&s;titution, the next que&s;tion was, the manner of giving it au|thority and practice.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="256"><Q>For this purpo&s;e, they did not like a cabal of courtiers, &s;end for a Dutch &s;tadtholder, or a German elector; but they referred the whole matter to the &s;en&s;e and intere&s;t of the country.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;entence, &s;tanding thus by it&s;elf, may ap|pear to be a mere &s;arca&s;m on King William, upon tho&s;e who effected the revolution; and upon the revolution it&s;elf, without any rea&s;oning or de|duction: But when the context and &s;equel are looked at and compared, it will appear to be a &s;e|rious hi&s;torical compari&s;on between the revoluti|on effected in England in 1688, and the late one in America when &s;he e&s;tabli&s;hed her independ+ence; and no man can doubt that his judgment on that compari&s;on was &s;incere. But where is the libel on the con&s;titution? For whether King Wil|liam was brought over here by the &s;incere&s;t and ju&s;te&s;t motives of the whole people of England, each man acting for him&s;elf, or through the motives and agencies imputed by the defendant, it &s;igni|fies not one farthing at this time of day to the e&s;tabli&s;hment it&s;elf. Black&s;tone warns us not to fix our obedience or affection to the government on the motives of our ance&s;tors, or the rectitude of their rea&s;onings, but to be &s;atisfied that it is e&s;tab|li&s;hed. This is &s;afe rea&s;oning, and for my own part, I &s;hall not be differently affected to the con|&s;titution of my country, which my own under|&s;tanding approved, whether angels or demons had given it birth.</P>
<P>Do any of you love the reformation the le&s;s be|cau&s;e Henry the Eighth was the author of it? Or becau&s;e lu&s;t and poverty, and not religion, were his motives. He had &s;quandered the trea&s;ures of his father, and he preferred Anne Bullen to his queen: the&s;e were the cau&s;es which produced it. What then! does that affect the purify of our re|formed religion, undermine its e&s;tabli&s;hment, or &s;hake the king's title as prince of the country, to
<PB N="256" REF="257">the exclu&s;ion of tho&s;e who held by the religion it had aboli&s;hed? Will the attorney general affirm, that I could be convicted of a libel for a whole volume of a&s;perity again&s;t Henry the Eighth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rely becau&s;e he effected the reformation; and if not, why again&s;t King William, who effected the revolution? Where is the line to be drawn? Is one, two, or three centuries to be &s;tatute of limi|tation. But do not our own hi&s;torians detail this very cabal of courtiers, from the records of our own country? If you will turn to Hume's hi&s;to|ry, volume the eighth, page <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">88, &amp;c. &amp;c. you will find that he &s;tates at great length, the whole detail of intrigues which paved the way for the revolution and the intere&s;ted coalition of parties which gave it effect.</P>
<P>But what of all this, concerning the motives of parties, which is recorded by Hume. The que&s;|tion is, <HI>what is the thing brought about,&mdash;Not</HI> HOW it was brought about. If it &s;tand as Black&s;tone argues it, upon the con&s;ent of our ance&s;tors, fol|lowed up by our own, no individual can with|draw his obedience. If he di&s;likes the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, let him &s;eek el&s;ewhere for another; I am not contending for uncontroled <HI>conduct,</HI> but for freedom of <HI>opinion.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to what has been &s;tated of the <HI>Edwards,</HI> and <HI>Henries.</HI> and the other princes under which the author can only di&s;cover <Q>re&s;trictions on power, but nothing of a con&s;titution:</Q> &s;ure|ly my friend is not in earne&s;t when he &s;elects that as a libel.</P>
<P>Paine in&s;i&s;ts, that there was no con&s;titution under tho&s;e princes, and that Engli&s;h liberty was ob|tained from u&s;urped power by the &s;truggles of the people. SO SAY I. And I think it for the ho|nour and advantage of the country that it &s;hould be known. Was there any freedom after the ori|ginal e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Normans by conque&s;t?
<PB N="257" REF="258">Was not the MAGNA CHARTA <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;ted from John by open force of arms at Runnymead? Was it not again re-enacted whil&s;t menacing arms were in the hands of the people?

I prote&s;t it fills me with a&s;toni&s;hment to hear the&s;e truths brought in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I was formerly called upon under the di&s;cipline of a college to maintain them, and was rewarded for being thought to have &s;ucce&s;sfully maintained, that our pre&s;ent con&s;titution was by no means a remnant of Saxon liberty, nor any other in&s;titution of liberty, but the pure con&s;equence of the op|pre&s;&s;ion of the Norman tenures, which &s;preading the &s;pirit of freedom from one end of the kingdom to the other, enabled our brave fathers, inch by inch, not to re-conquer, <HI>but for the fir&s;t time to obtain</HI> tho&s;e privileges which are the unalienable inheri|tance of all mankind.</P>
<P>But why do we &s;peak of the Edwards and Hen|ries, when Hume him&s;elf expre&s;sly &s;ays, notwith|&s;tanding all we have heard to-day of the antiquity of our con&s;titution, that our monarchy was near|ly ab&s;olute till the middle of la&s;t century. I have his book in court, and will read it to you. It is his e&s;&s;ay on the liberty of the pre&s;s. Vol. 1. page 15.</P>
<P><Q>All ab&s;olute governments, and &s;uch in great mea&s;ure was England, till the middle of the la&s;t century, <HI>notwith&s;tanding the numerous panegyrics on</HI> ANCIENT <HI>English liberty,</HI> mu&s;t very much depend on the admini&s;tration.</Q></P>
<P>This is Hume's opinion; the conclu&s;ion of a grave hi&s;torian from all that he finds recorded as the materials for hi&s;tory: and &s;hall it be &s;aid that Mr. Paine is to be puni&s;hed for writing to-day what was before written by another, who is now a di&s;tingui&s;hed cla&s;&s;ic in the language? All the

<P>The next pa&s;&s;age arrained is this: P. 56. <Q>The attention of the government of England, (for I rather chu&s;e to call it by this name, than the Engli&s;h government) appears, &s;ince its political connection with Germany, to have been &s;o com|pletely engro&s;&s;ed and ab&s;orbed by foreign affairs, and the means of rai&s;ing taxes, that it &s;eems to exi&s;t for no other purpo&s;es. Dome&s;tic concerns are neglected; and with re&s;pect to regular law, there is no &s;uch a thing.</Q></P>
<P>That the government of this country is, in con|&s;equence of its connection with the continent, and the continental wars which it has occa&s;ioned, been continually loaded with grievous taxes, no man can di&s;pute; and I appeal to your ju&s;tice, whether this &s;ubject has not been, for years toge|ther, the con&s;tant topic of unreproved declamati|on and grumbling?</P>
<P>As to what he &s;ays with regard to there hardly being &s;uch a thing as regular law, he &s;peaks in the ab&s;tract of the complexity of our &s;y&s;tem; but does not arraign the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice <HI>in its practice.</HI> But with regard to critici&s;ms and &s;tric|tures on the general &s;y&s;tem&punc; it has been echoed over and over again, by various authors; and even from the pulpits of our country, that the law of the land is mainly defective, devoid of regularity and preci&s;ion, and overloaded with a variety of expen&s;ive and unnece&s;&s;ary forms. I have a &s;ermon in court written during the American war, by a per&s;on of great eloquence and piety, part of which I will read to you on this &s;ubject, in which he looks forward to an exemption from the into|lerable grievances of our old legal &s;y&s;tem in the infant e&s;tabli&s;hment of the new world.</P>
<P><Q>It may be in the purpo&s;es of providence, on you we&s;tern &s;hores, to rai&s;e the bulwark of a
<PB N="259" REF="260">purer reformation than ever Britain patronized; to found a le&s;s burthen &s;ome, more au&s;picious, &s;ta|ble, and incorruptible government than ever Bri|tain has enjoyed; and to e&s;tabli&s;h there a &s;y&s;tem of law more ju&s;t and &s;imple in its principles, le&s;s intricate, dubious and dilatory in its pro|ceedings, more mild and equitable in its &s;ancti|ons, more ea&s;y and more certain in its execution; wherein no man can err through ignorance of what concerns him, or want ju&s;tice through poverty or weakne&s;s, or e&s;cape it by legal arti|fice, or civil privileges, or interpo&s;ing power; wherein the rule of conduct &s;hall not be hidden or di&s;gui&s;ed in the language of principles and cu&s;toms that died with the barbari&s;m which gave them birth; wherein ha&s;ty formulas &s;hall not di&s;&s;ipate the reverence that is due to the tribunals and tran&s;actions of ju&s;tice; wherein ob&s;olete pre&s;cripts &s;hall not pervert, nor entan|gle, nor impede the admini&s;tration of it, nor in any in&s;tance expo&s;e it to deri&s;ion or to di&s;regard; wherein mi&s;repre&s;entation &s;hall have no &s;hare in de&s;iding upon right and truth; and under which no man &s;hall grow great by the wages of chicanery, or thrive by the quarrels that are ruinous to his employers.</Q></P>
<P>This is ten times &s;tronger than Mr. Paine; but who ever thought of pro&s;ecuting Mr. Cappe?</P>
<P>In various other in&s;tances you will find defects in our juri&s;prudence. pointed out and lamented, and not &s;eldom by per&s;ons called upon by their &s;ituations to deliver the law in the &s;eat of magi&s;|tracy, therefore, the authors <HI>general</HI> ob&s;ervation does not appear to be that &s;pecies of attack upon the magi&s;tracy of the country as to fall within the de&s;cription of a libel.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the two hou&s;es of parliament, I believe I &s;hall be able to &s;hew you that the very per&s;on who introduced this controver&s;y, and who
<PB N="260" REF="261">certainly is con&s;idered by tho&s;e who now admi|ni&s;ter the government, as a man u&s;efully devoted to maintain the con&s;titution of the country in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, has him&s;elf made remarks upon the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies; that upon compari&s;on you will think more &s;evere than tho&s;e which are the &s;ubject of the attorney general's animadver&s;ion. The pa&s;|&s;age in Mr. Paine runs thus.</P>
<P><Q>With re&s;pect to the <HI>two hou&s;es,</HI> of which the Engli&s;h Parliament is compo&s;ed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a le|gi&s;lature, to have no temper of its own. The mini&s;ter, who ever he at any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it &s;leeps obedi|dence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But if we look at the di&s;tinct abilities of the two hou&s;es, the difference will appear &s;o great, as to &s;hew the incon&s;i&s;tency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to u&s;e it. Wretched as the &s;tate of repre&s;entation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is called the Hou&s;e of Lords; and &s;o little is this nick-named hou&s;e regarded, that the peo|ple &s;carcely enquire at any time what it is doing. It appears al&s;o to be mo&s;t under influence, and the furthe&s;t removed from the general intere&s;t of the nation.</Q></P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of the &s;entence, and which was meant by Paine as the evidence of the previous a&s;|&s;ertion, the attorney general has omitted in the information, and in his &s;peech, it is this: <Q>In the debate on engaging in the Ru&s;&s;ian and Turki&s;h war, the majority in the Hou&s;e of Peers in favour of it, was upwards of ninety, when in the other hou&s;e, which is more than double its numbers, the majority was &s;ixty three.</Q></P>
<P>The terms, however, in which Mr. Burke &s;peaks of the Hou&s;e of Lords, are &s;till more expre&s;&s;ive. <Q>It is &s;omething more than a century ago, &s;ince
<PB N="261" REF="262">we voted the Hou&s;e of Lords u&s;ele&s;s. They have now voted them&s;elves &s;o, and the whole hope of reformation</Q> (<HI>&s;peaking of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons</HI> "is ca&s;t upon us." This &s;entiment, Mr. Burke not only expre&s;&s;ed in his place in parlia|ment, where no man can call him to an account; but it has been &s;ince, repeatedly printed among&s;t his other valuable works. And his opinion of BOTH THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, which I am about to read to you, was originally publi&s;hed as a pamphlet, and applied to the &s;ettled abu&s;es of the&s;e high a&s;&s;emblies. Remember, I do not u&s;e them as <HI>argumenta ad hominem,</HI> or <HI>ad invidiam</HI> again&s;t the author, for if I did, it could be no defence of Mr. Paine. But I u&s;e them as high authority, the work [<HI>Mr. Burke's thoughts on the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent di&s;content, publi&s;hed in</HI> 1775] having been the ju&s;t foundation of &s;ub&s;tantial and la&s;ting reputation. Would to God that any part of it were capable of being denied or doubted.</P>
<P><Q>Again&s;t the being of parliament, I am &s;atisfied no de&s;igns have ever been entertained &s;ince the revolution. Every one mu&s;t perceive that it is &s;trongly the intere&s;t of the court to have &s;ome &s;econd cau&s;e interpo&s;ed between the mini&s;ters and the people. The gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons have an intere&s;t equally &s;trong, in &s;u&s;taining the part of that intermediate cau&s;e. However they may hire out the <HI>u&s;ufruct</HI> of their voices, they never will part with the <HI>fee</HI> and <HI>in|heritance.</HI> Accordingly tho&s;e who have been of the mo&s;t known devotion to the will and plea|&s;ure of a court, have at the &s;ame time been mo&s;t forward in a&s;&s;erting an high authority in the Hou&s;e of Commons. <HI>When they knew who were to u&s;e that authority, and how it was to be employed, they thought it never could be carried to far.</HI> It mu&s;t be always the wi&s;h of an uncon&s;titutional &s;tate&s;|man, that an Hou&s;e of Commons, <HI>who are entirely
<PB N="262" REF="263">dependant upon him, &s;hould have every right of the people dependant on their plea&s;ure.</HI> FOR IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE FORMS OF A FREE AND THE ENDS OF AN ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT, WERE THINGS NOT ALTOGETHER INCOMPA|TABLE.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The power of the crown almo&s;t dead and rot|ten as prerogative, has grown up a new, with much more &s;trength, and far le&s;s odium, under the name of <HI>influence.</HI> An influence which ope|rates without noi&s;e and violence; which con|verts the very antagoni&s;t into the in&s;trument of power; which contains in it&s;elf a perpetual principle of growth and renovation; and which the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">perity of the country equally tend to augment, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> an admirable &s;ub|&s;titute for a prerogative, that being only the off|&s;pring of antiquated prejudices, had moulded in its original &s;tamina irre&s;i&s;table principles of de|cay and di&s;&s;olution. The ignorance of the peo|ple is a bottom but for a temporary &s;y&s;tem; but the intere&s;t of active men in the &s;tate is a founda|tion perpetual and infallible.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke therefore, in page 66, &s;peaking of the &s;ame court party, &s;ays:</P>
<P><Q>Parliament was indeed the great object of all the&s;e politics, the end at which they aimed, as well as the INSTRUMENT by which they were to operate.</Q></P>
<P>And pur&s;uing the &s;ubject in page 70, proceeds as follows:</P>
<P><Q>They who will not confirm their conduct to the public good, and cannot &s;upport it by the prerogative of the crown have adopted a new plan. They have totally abandoned the &s;hatter|ed and old-fa&s;hioned fortre&s;s of prerogative, and made a lodgment in the &s;trong hold of parlia|ment it&s;elf. If they have any evil de&s;ign to which there is no ordinary legal power commen|&s;urate,
<PB N="263" REF="264">they bring it into parliament. <HI>There the whole is executed from the beginning to the end. And the power of obtaining their object ab&s;olute; and the &s;afety in the proceeding perfect; no rules to confine nor after reckonings to terrify,</HI> For parliament can|not with any propriety puni&s;h others for things in which they them&s;elves have been ACCOM|PLICES.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus its controul upon the executory power is lo&s;t; becau&s;e it is made to partake in every con&s;iderable act of government, <HI>and imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">achment, that great guardian of the purity of the con&s;titution, is in danger of being lo&s;t even to the idea of it.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Until this time, the opinion of the people, through the power of an a&s;&s;embly; &s;till in &s;ome &s;ort popular, led to the greate&s;t honours and emoluments in the gift of the crown. Now the principle is rever&s;ed; and the favour of the court is the only &s;ure way of obtaining and holding tho&s;e honours which ought to be IN THE DIS|POSAL OF THE PEOPLE.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke, in page 100, ob&s;erves with great truth, that the mi&s;chiefs he complained of, did not at all ari&s;e from the monarchy, but from the parliament, and that it was the duty of the peo|ple to look to it. He &s;ays, <Q>The di&s;tempers of monarchy were the great &s;ubjects of apprehen|&s;ion and redre&s;s, in the <HI>last century; in this,</HI> the di&s;tempers of parliament.</Q></P>
<P>Not the di&s;tempers of parliament in this year or the la&s;t, but in <HI>this century,</HI> i. e. its &s;ettled habitual di&s;temper. <Q>It is not in parliament alone that the remedy for parliamentary di&s;orders can be completed; and hardly indeed can it begin there. Until a confidence in government is re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, the people ought to be <HI>excited</HI> to a more &s;trict and detailed attention to the conduct of their re|pre&s;entatives. Standards for judging more &s;y&s;|tematically upon their conduct, ought to be &s;et|tled
<PB N="264" REF="265">in the meetings of counties and corporations, and frequent and correct li&s;ts of the voters in all important que&s;tions ought to be procured.</Q></P>
<P><Q>By &s;uch means &s;omething may be done, &s;ince it may appear who tho&s;e are, that by an indi&s;|criminate &s;upport of all admini&s;trations, have to|tally bani&s;hed all integrity and confidence out of public proceedings; have confounded the be&s;t men with the wor&s;t; and weakened and di&s;|&s;olved, in&s;tead of &s;trengthening and compacting the general frame of government.</Q></P>
<P>I wi&s;h it was po&s;&s;ible to read the whole of this mo&s;t important volume&mdash;but the con&s;equences of the&s;e truths contained in it were all eloquently &s;ummed up by the author in his &s;peech upon the reform of the hou&s;ehold.</P>
<P><Q>But what I confe&s;s was uppermo&s;t with me, what I bent the whole cour&s;e of my mind to, was the reduction of that <HI>corrupt influence</HI> which is it&s;elf the perennial &s;pring of all prodigality and di&s;order; which load us more than millions of debt; which takes away vigour from our arms, wi&s;dom from our councils, and every &s;hadow of authority and credit from the mo&s;t venerable parts of our con&s;titution.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame important truths were held out to the whole public, upon a &s;till later occa&s;ion, by the per&s;on now at the head of his maje&s;ty's councils; and &s;o high (as it appears) in the confidence of the nation. <HI>He,</HI> not in the ab&s;tract like the author be|fore you, but upon the &s;pur of the occa&s;ion, and in the teeth of what had been just declared in the Hou&s;e of Commons, came to, and acted upon re|&s;olutions which are contained in this book. <HI>(Mr. Er&s;kine took up a book.)</HI> Re&s;olutions pointed to the purification of a parliament, dangerou&s;ly corrupt|ed into the very state de&s;cribed by Mr. Paine. Re|member here too, that I impute no cen&s;ure to Mr, Pitt. It was the most brilliant pa&s;&s;age in his
<PB N="265" REF="266">life, and I &s;hould have thought his life a better one, if he had continued uniform in the &s;upport of opinions, which it is &s;aid he has not changed, and which certainly have had nothing to change them. But at all events, I have a right to make u&s;e of the authority of his &s;plended talents and &s;ituation, not merely to protect the defendant, but the public, and to re&s;i&s;t the precedent, that one man may do in England with approbation and glory, what &s;hall conduct another man to a pillory or a pri&s;on.</P>
<P>It was the abu&s;es pointed out by the man before you, that led that right honourable gentleman to a&s;&s;ociate with many others of high rank, under the banners of the Duke of Richmond, who&s;e name &s;tands at the head of the li&s;t, and to pa&s;s various public re&s;olutions, concerning the ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity of purifying the Hou&s;e of Commons; and we collect the plan from a preamble entered in the book. <Q>Whereas the life, liberty and property of every man is or may be affected by the law of the land in which he lives, and every man is bound to pay obedience to the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And whereas, by the con&s;titution of this king|dom, the right of making laws is ve&s;ted in three e&s;tates, of king, lords, and commons, in parlia|ment a&s;&s;embled, and the con&s;ent of all the three &s;aid e&s;tates, comprehending the whole commu|nity, is nece&s;&s;ary to make laws to bind the whole community. And whereas the Hou&s;e of Com|mons repre&s;ents all the commons of the realm, and the con&s;ent of the Hou&s;e of Commons binds the con&s;ent of all the commons of the realm, and in all ca&s;es on which the legi&s;lature is competent to decide.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And whereas no man is, or can be actually repre&s;ented who hath not a vote in the election of his repre&s;entative.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And whereas it is the right of every commone

<P><Q>And whereas the number of per&s;ons who are &s;ufl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red to vote for electing the members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, do not at this time a|mount to one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h part of the whole commons of this real<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whereby far the greater part of the &s;aid commons are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eprived of their right to elect their repre&s;entatives; and the con&s;ent of the ma|jority of the whole community to the pa&s;&s;ing of laws, is given by per&s;ons whom they have not delegated for &s;uch purpo&s;es; and the majority of the &s;aid community, and to which the &s;aid ma|jority have not in fact con&s;ented by them&s;elves or by their repre&s;entatives.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And whereas the &s;tate of election of members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, hath in proce&s;s of time &s;o gro&s;sly deviated from its &s;imple and na|tural principle of repre&s;entation and equality, and that in &s;everal places, the members are re|turned by the property of one man; that the &s;malle&s;t boroughs &s;end as many members as the large&s;t counties, and that a majority of the re|pre&s;entatives of the whole nation are cho&s;en by a number of votes not exceeding twelve thou&s;|and.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e with many others, were publi&s;hed, not as ab&s;tract, &s;peculative writings, but within a few days after the Hou&s;e of Commons had declared that no &s;uch rights exi&s;ted, and that no alteration was nece&s;&s;ary in the repre&s;entation. It was then that they met at the thatched-hou&s;e, and publi&s;h|ed their opinions and re&s;olutions to the country at large.&mdash;Were any of them pro&s;ecuted for the&s;e proceedings? Certainly not, (for they were legal proceedings.) But I de&s;ire you as men of honour
<PB N="267" REF="268">and truth, to compare all this with Mr. Paine's ex|pre&s;&s;ion of mini&s;ter's touching parliament with his opiate wand, and let equal ju&s;tice be done&mdash;that is all I a&s;k&mdash;LET ALL BE PUNISHED, OR NONE&mdash;do not let Mr. Paine be held out to the contempt of the public, upon the &s;core of his ob&s;ervations on parliament, while others are enjoying all the &s;weets which attend a &s;uppo&s;ed attachment to their country, who have &s;aid the &s;ame things, and re|duced their opinions to practice.</P>
<P>But now every man is to be cried down for &s;uch opinions. I ob&s;erved that my learned friend &s;ig|nificantly rai&s;ed his voice in naming Mr. Horne Tooke, as if to connect him with Paine, or Paine with him. This is exactly the &s;ame cour&s;e of ju&s;|tice; for after all he &s;aid nothing of Mr. Tooke. What could he have &s;aid, but that he was a &s;ub|&s;criber with the great names, I have read in the&s;e proceedings which they have thought fit to de&s;ert.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, let others hold their opinions and change them at their plea&s;ure; I &s;hall ever main|tain it to be the deare&s;t privilege of the people of Great Britain to watch over every thing that af|fects their good government, either in the &s;y&s;tem, or in the practice; and that for this purpo&s;e the pre&s;s mu&s;t be free.

<P>Gentlemen, I am no friend to &s;arca&s;ms in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of grave &s;ubjects, but you mu&s;t take writers according to the view of the mind at the moment; Mr. Burke as often as any body indulges it;&mdash;hear his rea&s;on in his &s;peech on reform, for not taking away the &s;alaries from lords who attend upon the Briti&s;h court. "You would," &s;aid he, <Q>have the court de&s;erted by all the nobility of the kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="269"><Q>Sir, the mo&s;t &s;erious mi&s;chiefs would follow from &s;uch a de&s;ertion. Kings are naturally lovers of low company; they are &s;o elevated above all the re&s;t of mankind, that they mu&s;t look upon all the ir&s;ubjects as on a level; tbey are rather apt to hate than to love their nobility, on account of the occa&s;ional re&s;i&s;tance to their will, which will be made by their virtue, their petu|lance, or their pride. It mu&s;t indeed be admit|ed, that many of the nobility are as perfectly willing to act the part of flatterers, tale-bearers, para&s;ites, pimps, and buffoons, as any of the lowe&s;t and vile&s;t of mankind can po&s;&s;ibly be. But they are not properly qualified for this ob|ject of their ambition. The want of a regular education, and early habits, with &s;ome lurking remains of their dignity, will never permit them to become a match for an Italian eunuch, a mountebank, a fidler, a player, or any regular practitioner of that tribe. The Roman Empe|rors, almo&s;t from the beginning, threw them|&s;elves into &s;uch hands; and the mi&s;chief in|crea&s;ed every day, till its decline, and its final ruin. It is, therefore, of very great importance (provided the thing is not overdone,) to con|trive &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hent as mu&s;t, almo&s;t whe|ther a prince will or not, bring into daily and hourly offices about his per&s;on, a great number of his fir&s;t nobility; and it is rather an u&s;eful pre|judice that gives them a pride in &s;uch a &s;ervi|tude: though they are not much the better for a court, a court will be much the better for them. I have, therefore, not attempted to reform any of the offices of honour about the king's per&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>What is this, but &s;aying that a king is an ani|mal &s;o incurably addicted to low company, as ge|nerally to bring on by it the ruin of nations; but neverthele&s;s, he is to be kept as a nece&s;&s;ary evil, and his propen&s;ities bridled by &s;urrounding him
<PB N="269" REF="270">with a parcel of mi&s;creants &s;till wor&s;e if po&s;&s;ible, but better than tho&s;e he would choo&s;e for him&s;elf. This therefore, if taken by it&s;elf, would be a mo&s;t abominable and libellous &s;arca&s;m on kings and no|bility: but look at the whole &s;peech, and you ob|&s;erve a great &s;y&s;tem of regulation; and no man, I believe, ever doubted Mr. Burke's attachment to monarchy. To judge, therefore, of any part of a writing, the whole mu&s;t be read.</P>
<P>With the &s;ame view, I mean to read to you, the beginning of Harrington's Oceana: but it is im|po&s;&s;ible to name this well known author without expo&s;ing to ju&s;t contempt and ridicule, the igno|rant or profligate mi&s;repre&s;entations which are vomited forth upon the public, to bear down eve|ry man as de&s;perately wicked, who in any age or country has countenanced a republic, for the mean purpo&s;e of prejudging this trial.</P>
<P>Is this the way to &s;upport the Engli&s;h con&s;titu|tion? Are the&s;e the means by which Engli&s;hmen are to be taught to cheri&s;h it? I &s;ay, if the man upon trial were &s;tained with blood in&s;tead of ink, if he were covered over with crimes which hu|man nature would &s;tart at the naming of, the means employed again&s;t him would not be the le&s;s di&s;|graceful.</P>
<P>For this notable purpo&s;e then, Harrington not above a week ago, was handed out to us as a low, ob&s;cure wretch, involved in the murder of the monarch, and the de&s;truction of the monarchy, and as addre&s;&s;ing his de&s;picable works at the &s;hrine of an u&s;urper. Yet this very Harrington, this low blackguard, was de&s;cended (you may &s;ee his pedi|gree at the Herald's-office for &s;ixpence,) from eight dukes, three marqui&s;&s;es, &s;eventy earls, twen|ty-&s;even vi&s;counts, and thirty-&s;ix barons, &s;ixteen of whom were knights of the garter; a de&s;cent which I think would &s;ave a man from di&s;grace in any of the circles of Germany. But what was he
<PB N="270" REF="271">be&s;ides?&mdash;A BLOOD-STAINED RUFFIAN? Oh; brutal ignorance of the hi&s;tory of the country. He was the mo&s;t affectionate &s;ervant of Charles the Fir&s;t, from whom he never concealed his opi|nions; for it is ob&s;erved by Wood, that the king greatly aflected his company; but when they hap|pened to talk of a common-wealth, he would &s;carce endure it.&mdash;'I know not,' &s;ays Toland, <Q>which mo&s;t to commend; the king for tru&s;ting an ho|ne&s;t man, though a republican; or Harrington for owning his principles while he &s;erved a king.</Q></P>
<P>But did his opinions affect his conduct? Let hi&s;|tory again an&s;wer.&mdash;He pre&s;erved his fidelity to his unhappy prince to the very la&s;t, after all his fawning courtiers had left him to his enraged &s;ubjects. He &s;taid with him while a pri&s;oner in the I&s;le of Wight, came up by &s;tealth to follow the fortunes of his monarch and ma&s;ter; even hid him|&s;elf in the boot of the coach when he was convey|ed to Wind&s;or; and ending as he began, fell into his arms and fainted on the &s;caffold.</P>
<P>After Charles's death, the Oceana was written, and, as if it were written from ju&s;tice and aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ction to his memory: for it breathes the &s;ame noble and &s;pirited regard, and a&s;&s;erts that it was not Charles that brought on the de&s;truction of the monarchy, but the feeble and ill-con&s;tituted nature of monar|chy it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But the book was a flattery to Cromwell.&mdash;Once more and finally let hi&s;tory decide.</P>
<P>It was &s;eized by the u&s;urper as a libel, and the way it was recovered was remarkable. I men|tion it to &s;hew that Cromwell was a wi&s;e man in him&s;elf, and knew on what government mu&s;t &s;tand for their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">rt.</P>
<P>Harrington waited on his daughter to beg for his book<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd on entering her apartment, &s;natched up her child and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n away.&mdash;On her following him with &s;urprize an terror, he turned to her and &s;aid
<PB N="271" REF="272"><Q>I know what you feel as a mother, feel then for me; your father has got my child:</Q> mean|ing the oceana.

Monte&s;quieu &s;ays that In a free nation, it matters not whe|ther individuals rea&s;on well or ill; it is &s;uf|ficient that they do rea&s;on. Truth ari&s;es from the colli&s;ion, and from hence &s;prings liberty, which is a &s;ecurity from the effect of rea&s;oning.</Q> The attorney general read extracts from Mr. Adams's An&s;wer to this book.

<P>A di&s;po&s;ition in a nation to this &s;pecies of contro|ver&s;y, is no proof of &s;edition or degeneracy, but quite the rever&s;e, as is mentioned by Milion, [I omitted to cite the pa&s;&s;age with the others] who in &s;peaking of this &s;ubject, ri&s;es into that inex|pre&s;&s;ible &s;ublime &s;tile of writing, wholly peculiar to him&s;elf. He was indeed no plagiary from any thing human: he looked up for light and expre&s;|&s;ion, as he him&s;elf wonderfully de&s;cribes it, by de|vout prayer to that great being, who is the &s;ource of all utterance and knowledge; and who &s;endeth out his &s;eraphim with the hallowed fire of his al|tars, to touch and purify the lips of whom he plea&s;es. 'When the chearfulne&s;s of the people,' &s;ays this mighty poet, <Q>is &s;o &s;prightly up, as that is has not only wherewith to guard well its own freedom and &s;afety, but to &s;pare, and to be&s;tow upon the &s;olide&s;t and &s;ublime&s;t points of controver&s;y and new inventions, it betokens us not degenerated
<PB N="272" REF="273">nor drooping to a fatal decay, but ca&s;ting off the old and wrinkled &s;kin of corruption to outlive the&s;e pangs, and wax young again, entering the glorious ways of truth and pro&s;perous virtue, de&s;|tined to become great and honourable in the&s;e latter ages. Methinks I &s;ee in my mind, a noble and pui&s;ant nation rou&s;ing her&s;elf, like a &s;trong man after &s;leep, and &s;haking her invincible locks: methinks I &s;ee her as an eagle muing her migh|ty youth, and kindling her undazzled eyes at the full mid-day beam; purging and un&s;ealing her long abu&s;ed &s;ight at the fountain it&s;elf of heavenly radiance; while the whole noi&s;e of timorous and flocking birds, with tho&s;e al&s;o that love the twilight, flutter about, amazed at what &s;he means, and in their envious gabble would progno&s;ticate a year of &s;ects and &s;chi&s;ms.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, what Milton only &s;aw in his mighty imagination, I &s;ee in fact; what he expected, but what never came to pa&s;s, I &s;ee now fulfilling: methinks I &s;ee this noble and pui&s;&s;ant nation, not degenerated and drooping to a fatal decay, but ca&s;ting off the wrinkled &s;kin of corruption to put on again the vigour of her youth.</P>
<P>And it is, becau&s;e others, as well as my&s;elf &s;ee this, that we have ALL THIS UPROAR;&mdash;France and its con&s;titution are the mere pretences. It is, becau&s;e Britons begin to recollect the inheritance of their own con&s;titution, left them by their an|ce&s;tors: It is, becau&s;e they are awakened to the corruptions which have fallen upon its mo&s;t valua|ble parts, that for&s;ooth THE NATION IS IN DAN|GER OF BEING DESTROYED BY A SINGLE PAMPHLET.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have marked the cour&s;e of this alarm: It began with the renovation of tho&s;e exer|tions for the public, which the authors of the alarm had them&s;elves originated and de&s;erted; and they became louder and louder when they &s;aw the&s;e
<PB N="273" REF="274">principles avowed and &s;upported by my admirable and excellent friend Mr. Fox; the mo&s;t eminent|ly hone&s;t and enlightened &s;tate&s;man, that hi&s;tory brings us acquainted with: a man whom to name is to honour, but whom in attempting adequately to de&s;cribe, I mu&s;t fly to Mr. Burke, my con&s;tant refuge when eloquence is nece&s;&s;ary: a man, who to relieve the &s;ufferings of the mo&s;t di&s;tant nation, <Q>put to the hazard, his ea&s;e, his &s;ecurity, his in|tere&s;t, his power, even his darling popularity, for the benefit of a people whom he had never &s;een,</Q> How much more than for the inhabit|ants of his native country; yet this is the man who has been cen&s;ured and di&s;avowed in the manner we have lately &s;een.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have but a few more words to trouble you with; I take my leave of you with declaring, that all this freedom which I have been endeavouring to a&s;&s;ert, is no more than the free|dom which belongs to our inbred con&s;titution; I have not a&s;ked to acquit Mr. Paine upon any new lights, or upon any principle but the law, which you are &s;worn to admini&s;ter: My great object has been to inculcate, that wi&s;dom and policy, which are the parents of the law of Great Britain, forbid this jealous eye over her &s;ubjects: and that, on the contrary, they cry aloud in the language of the poet, employed by Lord Chatham on the memo|rable &s;ubject of America, unfortunately without effect:</P>
<Q><L>"Be to their faults a little blind,</L>
<L>"Be to their virtues, very kind;</L>
<L>"Let all their thoughts be unconfin'd,</L>
<L>"And clap your padlock on their mind."</L></Q>
<P>Engage them by their affections, convince their rea&s;on, and they will be loyal from the only prin|ciple that can make loyalty &s;incere, vigorous, or rational, a conviction that it is their true&s;t intere&s;t,
<PB N="274" REF="275">and that their form of government is for their com|mon good. Con&s;traint is the natural parent of re&s;i&s;tance, and a pregnant proof, that rea&s;on is not on the &s;ide of tho&s;e who u&s;e it.

<HEAD>ORIGIN OF THE SWISS REPUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE pre&s;ent inhabitants of Swi&s;&s;erland are de&s;cended from the ancient Helvetii, who were &s;ubdued by Julius Cae&s;ar. They continued long under little better than the nominal dominion of the Hou&s;es of Burgundy and Au&s;tria, till the be|ginning of the 14th century, when the &s;everity with which they were treated by the Au&s;trian go|vernors, excited a general in&s;urrection, and gave ri&s;e to what is now called, from the ancient name of the country, the Helvetic confederacy.</P>
<P>This memorable event <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thus related: Albert, Emperor of Germany, having in vain attempted to compel all the Switzers to &s;ubmit to the yoke of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;e of Au&s;tria, the&s;e people were &s;o cruelly treated, that they entered into a confede|racy, in order to &s;upport their ancient rights and privileges. Gri&s;ler, the governor of Uri, in or|der to di&s;cover the authors of the con&s;piracy, or|dered that his hat &s;hould be fixed on the top of a pole in the market place of Altof, the capital of that province; and all tho&s;e who pa&s;&s;ed by it were obliged, on pain of death, to pay obei&s;ance to it, as if to the governor him&s;elf.</P>
<P>William Tell, a man of influence in his coun|try, di&s;daining the mark of vi&s;&s;alage and &s;lavery, refu&s;ed to obey the tyrant's order; upon which the latter cau&s;ed him to be arre&s;ted, and condemn|ed him to &s;hoot an apple from the head of his only &s;on, who was about five years old. Tell an&s;wer|ed, that he would rather &s;uffer death him&s;elf, than ri&s;que the &s;afety of his &s;on. The tyrant declared, that he would hang them both, if he did not in|&s;tantly
<PB N="276" REF="277">obey. Thus compelled, Tell reluctantly took his bow, and from the head of his &s;on, who was tied to a tree, he &s;hot away the apple, to thr admiration of all the &s;pectators. The governo perceiving that he had a &s;econd arrow, demanded what he intended to do with it; a&s;&s;uring him at the &s;ame time of his full pardon, if he would di&s;|clo&s;e the truth.&mdash;'To pierce thy heart,' replied Tell, 'If I had been &s;o unfortunate as to kill my &s;on.'</P>
<P>Gri&s;ler, ba&s;ely violating his promi&s;e, loaded him with chains, and made him embark with him on board a ve&s;&s;el that was to cro&s;s Lake Uri, in or|der to confine him in a dungeon in one of his ca&s;|tles; but a dreadful tempe&s;t ari&s;ing, the governor found that Tell's a&s;&s;i&s;tance was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ave him&s;elf and his crew. He therefore ordered his fetters to be taken off; and Tell, having &s;teered the ve&s;&s;el with &s;afety towards a landing place, with which he was well acquainted. threw him|&s;elf into the water with his bow, and fled to the mountain. He there waited in a place that Gri&s;ler was obliged to pa&s;s, and &s;hot him in the heart with his remaining arrow. The brave Switzer then ha&s;tened to announce the death of the tyrant, and their con&s;equent deliverance, to the confederates; and putting him&s;elf at the head of a multitude of his gallant countrymen, he took all the fortre&s;&s;es, and made the governors pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Such is the celebrated hi&s;tory of the commence|ment of Swi&s;s liberty, which &s;ome of the greate&s;t painters have &s;elected as a favourite &s;ubject. It mu&s;t not be concealed, however that &s;ome hi&s;to|rians affect to call in que&s;tion, the circum&s;tance of the apple; while others, on the contrary, have im|plicitly received it.</P>
<P>But, not to inve&s;tigate this &s;ubject further, all hi&s;torians are agreed, that William Tell was one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed authors of this glorious
<PB N="277" REF="278">revolution; Gri&s;ler was unque&s;tionably killed by him with an arrow. He entered into an a&s;&s;ociati|on with Werner Stouffacher. Walter Fur&s;t, and Arnold de Melctal, who&s;e father had been depri|ved of his &s;ight by the inhuman mon&s;ter. The plan of this revolution was formed on the 14th of November, 1307. The Emperor Albert, who would have treated the&s;e illu&s;trious men as rebels, was prevented by his death. The Archduke Leop|old marched into their country with an army of 20,000 men.</P>
<P>With a force, not exceeding 500, the brave Switzers waited for the main body of the Au&s;trian army in the defiles of Morgate. More fortunate than Leonidas and his Lacedemonians, they put the invaders to flight, by rolling down great &s;tones from the tops of the mountains. Other bodies of the Au&s;trian army were defeated at the &s;ame time, by a number of Switzers equally &s;mall. This vic|tory having been gained in the Canton of Schweitz, the other two Cantons gave this name to the con|federacy, into which by degrees other Cantons en|tered.</P>
<P>Berne, which is to Switzerland what Am&s;terdam is to Holland, did not accede to this alliance till the year 1352; and it was not till 1513, that the &s;mall di&s;trict of Appenzel united to the other can|tons, and completed the number of thirteen. No people ever fought longer, nor better for their li|berty. They gained more than 60 combats again&s;t the Au&s;trians, and it is believed, will long pre|&s;erve their independence. A country, which is not too exten&s;ive, nor too opulent, and where the laws breathe a &s;pirit of mildne&s;s, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be free.</P>
<P>This revolution in the government, produced another in the a&s;pect of the country. A barren &s;oil, neglected under the dominion of tyrants, be|came at length the &s;cene of cultivation. Vine|yards
<PB N="278" REF="279">were planted on rocky mountains, and &s;a|vage tracts, cleared and tilled by the hands of free|men, became the fertile abode of peace and plenty.</P>

<P>'TIS owing to the arts and indu&s;try of Sedu|cers, that the people are &s;ometimes unea&s;y and di&s;content under a good government; for un|der &s;uch a government they are naturally inclined to be quiet and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and it mu&s;t be very ill u&s;age that will tempt them to throw it off, when they are not fir&s;t notoriou&s;ly mi&s;led. There were in&s;urrections again&s;t Gu&s;tavus Eric&s;on, &s;o there were again&s;t Queen Elizabeth; all animated by the &s;ame &s;pirit, &s;uper&s;tition managed and inflamed by prie&s;ts. But when a ju&s;t admini&s;tration is once &s;ettled, and become familiar to the people, and where no violent innovations are attempted, they
<PB N="279" REF="280">will not be apt &s;o di&s;turb it, nor to wi&s;h ill to it. They are in truth very &s;low to re&s;i&s;t, and often bear a thou&s;and hard&s;hips before they return one. The Romans long &s;uffered the encroachments, in&s;ults and tyranny of the la&s;t tarquin, before they drove him out, nor would they have done it &s;o &s;oon, but for the rape and tragical fate of Lucretia. The Dutch endured the tyranny of Spain, till that ty|ranny grew intolerable. When King Philip had wantonly violated his &s;olemn oath, de&s;troyed their ancient liberties and laws, &s;hed their blood, acted like an implacable enemy, and u&s;ed them like dogs, it was high time to convince him that they were men, and would continue free men in &s;pite of his wicked attempts to en&s;lave them. They did &s;o to &s;ome purpo&s;e, to their own immortal glory, and e&s;tabli&s;hment in perfect independency, to his in|finite lo&s;s and la&s;ting &s;hame.</P>
<P>The people of Swi&s;&s;erland groaned long under the heavy yoke of Au&s;tria, &s;u&s;tained a cour&s;e of &s;ufferings and indignities too many and too great for human patience. So in&s;olent and barbarous were their governors, &s;o tame and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive the governed. At la&s;t they rou&s;ed them&s;elves, or rather their oppre&s;&s;ive governors rou&s;ed them, &s;o as not to be quelled. Yet they carried their vengeance no farther than was barely nece&s;&s;ary for their fu|ture &s;ecurity. They &s;pilt little or none of the blood of their tyrants and ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, the rulers from Au&s;tria, who had &s;o freely &s;pilled theirs. They only conducted the&s;e lawle&s;s &s;poilers to the bor|ders of the country, and there di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them in &s;afety, under an oath never more to return into their territories. What could be more &s;low to re|&s;i&s;t, what more meek in their re&s;i&s;tance than that brave and abu&s;ed people? They were indeed &s;o brave and had been &s;o abu&s;ed, as to re&s;olve never more to &s;ubmit to the imperial power. Thence forth they a&s;&s;erted their native freedom, and a&s;|&s;erted
<PB N="280" REF="281">it with amazing valour. With handfuls of men they overthrew mighty ho&s;ts, and could ne|ver be conquered by all the neighbouring powers. Their exploits again&s;t the imperial armies, again&s;t tho&s;e of Lewis the Eleventh, then Dauphin, again&s;t Charles the bold, Duke of Burgundy are &s;carce credible. Three hundred and fifty Swi&s;s routed at one time, eight thou&s;and Au&s;trians, &s;ome &s;ay &s;ixteen thou&s;and. An hundred and thirteen van|qui&s;hed, the arch-duke Leopald's army of twenty thou&s;and, and killed a great number; an hundred and &s;ixteen beat another army of near twenty thou|&s;and, and &s;lew him.</P>
<P>It was no &s;mall provocation, no ca&s;ual mi&s;takes, or random &s;allies of pa&s;&s;ion in their rulers, that drove the Dutch and Swi&s;s to expel theirs. No; the oppre&s;&s;ion, the acts of violence were general, con&s;tant, deliberate and encrea&s;ing. For &s;uch is the nature of men in power; that they will rather commit two errors than retract one, as Lord Cla|rendon ju&s;tly ob&s;erves. Sometimes they will com|mit a &s;econd, to &s;hew that they are not a&s;hamed of the fir&s;t, but re&s;olved to defy re&s;entment, to de|clare their contempt of the people, and how much they are above fear and amendment. Some of them have delighted to heighten cruelty by mirth and deri&s;ion, like him in Swi&s;&s;erland, who having long in&s;ulted and abu&s;ed the poor people, and &s;till thinking their &s;ervitude imperfect, &s;et up his cap in the market place, and obliged all that pa&s;&s;ed by to pay it reverence; nay to puni&s;h one for failing in duty to that cap, he cau&s;ed him to place an ap|ple upon his &s;on's head, and at &s;uch a di&s;tance to cleave it with an arrow. Was there not cau&s;e, was it not high time to exterminate &s;uch in&s;truments of cruelty?</P>

<L>In arms we breed our youth. To dart from far,</L>
