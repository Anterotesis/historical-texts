<P>S'Death, <HI>Jerry,</HI> I'm all on Fire &mdash; well &mdash; the dear Minute of Appointment is ju&s;t at hand; this Letter in An&s;wer to the One you deliver'd her, informs me, that &s;he's kept by an old Jealous Knight in the City &mdash; &s;he's a fine Woman by Heaven &mdash; and if it be in the Power of her Sex to drive that intollerable Coquet <HI>Charlott</HI> out of my Head, I think 'tis &s;he can do it.</P>

<P>Heaven &s;end there comes a good End on't &mdash; well, if I &s;hou'd have my Bones &s;hat|ter'd in this Rencounter, 'twill not be the fir&s;t Time I have been paid for my Inge|nuity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peace, Scoundrel, and learn to bear Misfortunes with a Pimplike Patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patience! yes you may talk of Pa|tience truly, while all the Plea&s;ure of the Sin belongs to your&s;elf, and all the Puni&s;hment to your humble Servant &mdash; how oft have the&s;e unfortunate Bones of mine been beaten to a Jelly in your Service!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sirrah, if your Ill-Stars con|demn you to Di&s;appointments, can I prevent them? If ever you &s;uffer'd in your Vocation, &s;ome unfortunate Blunder of your own oc|ca&s;ion'd it; you remember the Letter you gave to <HI>Charlott</HI>'s Jealous Guardian? When
<PB N="7" REF="6">in the overflowing of your Wi&s;dom you mi&s;took him for her Footman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Remember it! I do, by all that's un|fortunate: confound the old Dog &mdash; he laid on me like an <HI>Hercules.</HI> He had put on her Footman's Livery on purpo&s;e to lay wait for me; yet all this I cou'd have borne with the Patience of an Alderman, but the in&s;up|portable Weight of your Honour's Oaken Cudgel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Re&s;entment was rea&s;onable, Sir|rah, &s;uch a prepo&s;terous Mi&s;take! but tell me <HI>Jerry,</HI> don't you think <HI>Charlott</HI> will be confoundedly piqu'd at my &s;o &s;udden De|parture fron <HI>Oxford,</HI> without &s;ending her one &s;ingle Line, or whining out the lea&s;t tender Adieu at Parting?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Piqu'd, Sir! Lord, Sir, I thought you under&s;tood the in&s;ide of a Coquet better, tho' it might puzzle one of a longer &s;tanding at <HI>Oxford,</HI> to tell what to make of her &mdash; why, Sir, a Coquet is always &s;o well pleas'd with her&s;elf that nothing in Nature is capable of di&s;compo&s;ing her.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, <HI>Jerry,</HI> tho' &s;he u&s;ed me with &s;uch a &s;tudied ill Nature, I &s;ometimes thought &s;he did not hate me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hate you! no, no, Sir, in my humble

<P>Come, out with it Sirrah, I &s;han't be angry.</P>

<P>Why, really Sir, you do make &s;omething Free with me, but will your Wor&s;hip be pleas'd to explain what you mean by honouring me with that extraordi|nary Title?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, I beg you won't take it ill that I &s;aid &s;o, for on my Honour, Sir, I a&s;&s;ure you I have &s;een Per&s;ons of great Rank and Di&s;tinction act over all the pretty Follies of that &s;agacious Animal, and value them|&s;elves extremely upon it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray then, mo&s;t Philo&s;ophical Sir, will you plea&s;e to inform me, what one Action of mine happens to fall under the La&s;h of your Satire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, really Sir, as you have been &s;o long notorious in the Cla&s;s of Lovers, I think your Que&s;tion is ea&s;ily re&s;olv'd: Lovers &s;ince the Creation have been generally e&s;teem'd
<PB N="9" REF="8">little better than&mdash;but &s;ince the Title of the fore-mention'd Animal &s;eems to affect you &s;o nearly, I'll forbear repeating it, and leave it to your&s;elf to con&s;ider, what are the Mo|tives which hurried you &s;o &s;uddenly to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> with &s;carce a &s;ingle Guinea in your Pocket, unknown to your Father, or Friends, and I may even venture to &s;ay almo&s;t un|known to your&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>Jerry,</HI> I think my coming to <HI>London</HI> a Ma&s;terpiece of Re&s;olution, and I applaud my&s;elf for it extremely. I doated even to Folly on that <HI>Charlott,</HI> the greate&s;t Tyrant of her Sex. You are &s;en&s;ible how &s;he u&s;ed me &mdash; in &s;hort I was become ridicu|lous even to my&s;elf, and judging with a great deal of Ju&s;tice that in dear <HI>London</HI> alone I might hope to recover my Rea&s;on, I re&s;olv'd to break my Chains at once, and let the Coquet &s;ee that Beauty without Merit had lo&s;t all Power to make a Fool of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>So we take Hor&s;e in a Pet, Whip, Spur, and away; leave being &s;illy at <HI>Oxford</HI> to come and play the downright Fool at <HI>London;</HI> for Cur&s;e me, Sir, &s;till begging your Honour's Pardon, if I can at pre&s;ent &s;ee that your Intentions are conducted with the lea&s;t Appearance of common Sen&s;e.</P>

<P>Since I mu&s;t explain my Intentions, Sir, to make a Man of your va&s;t Judgment approve them, you mu&s;t know that by a Va|riety of Plea&s;ures here in <HI>London,</HI> I de&s;ign to lo&s;e even the Remembrance of my <HI>Oxford</HI> Mi&s;tre&s;s; and lea&s;t the Pre&s;ence of an old peevi&s;h Father might Interrupt tho&s;e Plea&s;ures, I am po&s;itively re&s;olv'd to avoid all Places where 'twere probable I might meet with him.</P>
