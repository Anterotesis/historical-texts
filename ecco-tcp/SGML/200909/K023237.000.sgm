<HEAD>DISCOURSE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>RELIGION has two principal enemies, Fanatici&s;m and Infidelity, or that which is called Athei&s;m. The fir&s;t requires to be combated by rea&s;on and morality, the other by natural philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>THE exi&s;tence of a God is the fir&s;t dogma of the Theophilanthropi&s;ts. It is upon this &s;ubject that I &s;olicit your attention: for though it has been often treated of, and that mo&s;t &s;u|blimely, the &s;ubject is inexhau&s;tible; and there will always remain &s;omething to be &s;aid that has not been before advanced. I go therefore to open the &s;ubject, and to crave your atten|tion to the end.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4">THE univer&s;e is the bible of a true Theo|philanthropi&s;t. It is there that he reads of God. It is there that the proofs of his exi&s;t|ence are to be &s;ought and to be found. As to written or printed books, by whatever name they are called, they are the works of man's hands, and carry no evidence in them&s;elves that God is the author of any of them. It mu&s;t be in &s;omething that man could not make, that we mu&s;t &s;eek evidence for our belief, and that &s;omething is the univer&s;e; the true bible; the inimitable word of God.</P>
<P>CONTEMPLATING the univer&s;e, the whole &s;y&s;tem of creation, in this point of light, we &s;hall di&s;cover, that all that which is called natural philo&s;ophy is properly a divine &s;tudy&mdash;It is the &s;tudy of God through his works&mdash;It is the be&s;t &s;tudy, by which we can arrive at a knowledge of his exi&s;tence, and the only one by which we can gain a glimp&s;e of his per|fection.</P>
<P>DO we want to contemplate his power? we &s;ee it in the immen&s;ity of the Creation. Do we want to contemplate his wi&s;dom? We &s;ee it in the unchangeable order by which the incomprehen&s;ible WHOLE is governed. Do we want to contemplate his munificence? We &s;ee
<PB N="7" REF="5">it in the abundance with which he fills the earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We &s;ee it in his not withholding that abundance even from the unthankful. In fine, do we want to know what God is? Search not written or printed books, but the Scripture called the <HI>Creation.</HI></P>
<P>IT has been the error of the &s;chools to teach a&s;tronomy, and all the other &s;ciences, and &s;ubjects of natural philo&s;ophy, as accom|pli&s;hments only; whereas they &s;hould be taught theologically, or with reference to the Being who is the author of them; for all the prin|ciples of &s;cience are of Divine origin. Man cannot make, or invent, or contrive principles. He can only di&s;cover them; and he ought to look through the di&s;covery to the author.</P>
<P>WHEN we examine an extraordinary piece of machinery, an a&s;toni&s;hing pile of architecture, a well executed &s;tatue, or an highly fini&s;hed painting, where life and action are imitated, and habit only prevents our mi&s;taking a &s;urface of light and &s;hade for cubical &s;olidity, our ideas are naturally led to think of the exten&s;ive genius and talents of the arti&s;t. When we &s;tudy elements of geometry, we think of Eu|clid. When we &s;peak of gravitation, we think
<PB N="8" REF="6">of Newton. How then is it that when we &s;tudy the works of God in the Creation, we &s;top &s;hort, and do not think of God? It is from the error of the &s;chools in having taught tho&s;e &s;ubjects as accompli&s;hments only, and thereby &s;eparated the &s;tudy of them from the Being who is the author of them.</P>
<P>THE &s;chools have made the &s;tudy of theology to con&s;i&s;t in the &s;tudy of opinions in written or printed books; whereas theology &s;hould be &s;tudied in the works or books of the creation, The &s;tudy of theology in books or opinions has often produced fanatici&s;m, rancour, and cruelty of temper; and from hence have proceeded the numerous per&s;ecutions, the fa|natical quarrels, the religious burnings and ma&s;&s;acres, that have de&s;olated Europe. But the &s;tudy of theology in the works of the cre|ation produces a direct contrary effect. The mind becomes at once enlightened and &s;erene; a copy of the &s;cene it beholds; information and adoration go hand in hand; and all the &s;ocial faculties become enlarged.</P>
<P>THE evil that has re&s;ulted from the error of the &s;chools, in teaching natural philo&s;ophy as an accompli&s;hment only, has been that of generating in the pupils a &s;pecies of Athei&s;m.
<PB N="9" REF="7">In&s;tead of looking through the works of Creation to the Creator him&s;elf, they &s;top &s;hort, and employ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> knowledge they acquire to create doubts of his exi&s;tence. They labour, with &s;tudied ingenuity, to a&s;cribe every thing they behold to innate properties of matter, and jump over all the re&s;t, by &s;aying, that matter is eternal.</P>
<P>LET us examine this &s;ubject; it is worth examining; for if we follow it through all its ca&s;es, the re&s;ult will be, that the exi&s;tence of a &s;uperior cau&s;e, or that which man calls God, will be di&s;coverable by philo&s;ophical prin|ciples.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, admitting matter to have properties, as we &s;ee it has, the que&s;tion &s;till remains, how came matter by tho&s;e proper|ties? To this they will an&s;wer, that matter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e properties eternally. This is not &s;olution, but a&s;&s;ertion; and to deny it is equally as impo&s;&s;ble of proof as to a&s;&s;ert it. It is then nece&s;&s;ary to go further, and therefore I &s;ay,&mdash;if there exi&s;t a circum&s;tance that is not a property of matter, and without which the univer&s;e, or to &s;peak in a limited degree, the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, compo&s;ed of planets and a &s;un, could not exi&s;t a moment; all the arguments
<PB N="10" REF="8">of Athei&s;m, drawn from properties of matter, and applied to account for the univer&s;e, will be overthrown, and the exi&s;tence of a &s;uperior cau&s;e, or that which man calls God, becomes di&s;coverable, as is before &s;aid, by natural phi|lo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>I go now to &s;hew that &s;uch a circum&s;tance exi&s;ts, and what it is.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;e is compo&s;ed of matter, and, as a &s;y&s;tem, is &s;u&s;tained by motion. Motion is <HI>not a property</HI> of matter, and without this motion the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem could not exi&s;t. Were motion a property of matter, that undi&s;covered and undi&s;coverable thing, called perpetual mo|tion, would e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf. It is becau&s;e motion is not a property of matter, that perpetual motion is an impo&s;&s;ibility in the hand of every being but that of the Creator of motion. When the pretenders to Athei&s;m can produce perpe|tual motion, and not till then, they may expect to be credited.</P>
<P>THE natural &s;tate of matter, as to place, is a &s;tate of re&s;t. Motion, or change of place, is the effect of an external cau&s;e acting upon matter. As to that faculty of matter, that is called gravitation, it is the in|fluence
<PB N="11" REF="9">which two or more bodies have reci|procally on each other to unite and be at re&s;t. Every thing which has hitherto been di&s;covered with re&s;pect to the motion of the planets in the &s;y&s;tem, relates only to the laws by which motion acts, and not to the cau&s;e of motion. Gravitation, &s;o far from being the cau&s;e of motion to the planets that compo&s;e the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, would be the de&s;truction of the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, were revolutionary motions to cea&s;e; for as the action of &s;pinning upholds a top, the revolutionary motion upholds the planets in their orbits, and prevents them from gravi|tating and forming one ma&s;s with the &s;un. In one &s;en&s;e of the word, philo&s;ophy knows, and athei&s;m, &s;ays, that matter is in perpetual mo|tion. But the motion here meant refers to the <HI>&s;tate</HI> of matter, and that only on the &s;urface of the earth. It is either decompo&s;ition, which is continually de&s;troying the form of bodies of matter, or recompo&s;ition, which renews that matter in the &s;ame or another form, as the de|compo&s;ition of animal or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances enter into the compo&s;ition of other bodies. But the motion that upholds the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem is of an entire different kind, and is not a property of matter. It operates al&s;o to an entire different effect. It operates to <HI>perpetual pre&s;ervation,</HI> and to prevent <HI>any change</HI> in the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="10">GIVING then to matter all the properties which philo&s;ophy knows it has, or all that athei&s;m a&s;cribes to it, and can prove, and even &s;uppo&s;ing matter to be eternal, it will not ac|count for the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e or of the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, becau&s;e it will not account for mo|tion, and it is motion that pre&s;erves it. When, therefore, we di&s;cover a circum&s;tance of &s;uch immen&s;e importance, that without it the uni|ver&s;e could not exi&s;t, and for which neither matter, nor any, nor all, the properties of mat|ter can account, we are by nece&s;&s;ity forced into the rational and comfortable belief of the exi&s;t|ence of a cau&s;e &s;uperior to matter, and that cau&s;e man calls, GOD.</P>
<P>AS to that which is called nature, it is no other than the laws by which motion and action of every kind, with re&s;pect to unintelligible matter, is regulated. And when we &s;peak of looking through nature up to nature's God, we &s;peak philo&s;ophically the &s;ame rational language as when we &s;peak of looking through human law up to the power that ordained them.</P>
<P>GOD is the power or fir&s;t cau&s;e, nature is the law, and matter is the &s;ubject acted upon.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="11">BUT infidelity by a&s;cribing every phaeno|mena to properties of matter, conceives a &s;y&s;tem for which it cannot account, and yet it pretends to demon&s;tration. It rea&s;ons from what it &s;ees on the &s;urface of the earth, but it does not carry it&s;elf on the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem exi&s;ting by mo|tion. It &s;ees upon the &s;urface a perpetual de|compo&s;ition and recompo&s;ition of matter. It &s;ees that an oak produces an acorn, an acorn an oak, a bird an egg, an egg a bird, and &s;o on. In things of this kind it &s;ees &s;omething which it calls a natural cau&s;e, but none of the cau&s;es it &s;ees is the cau&s;e of that motion which pre&s;erves the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>LET us contemplate this wonderful and &s;tupendous &s;y&s;tem con&s;i&s;ting of matter and ex|i&s;ting by motion. It is not matter in a &s;tate of re&s;t, nor in a &s;tate of decompo&s;ition or re|compo&s;ition. It is matter &s;y&s;tematized in per|petual orbicular or circular motion. As a &s;y&s;tem that motion is the life of it: as anima|tion is life to an animal body, deprive the &s;y&s;tem of motion, and, as a &s;y&s;tem it mu&s;t expire. Who then breathed into the &s;y&s;tem the life of motion? What power impelled the planets to move &s;ince motion is not a property of the matter of which they are compo&s;ed? If we contemplate the immen&s;e velocity of
<PB N="14" REF="12">this motion, our wonder becomes increa&s;ed, and our adoration enlarges it&s;elf in the &s;ame proportion. To in&s;tance only one of the pla|nets, that of the earth we inhabit, its di&s;tance from the &s;un, the centre of the orbits of all the planets, is, according to ob&s;ervations of the tran&s;it of the planet Venus, about one hundred million miles, con&s;equently the diameter of the orbit or circle in which the earth moves round the &s;un is double that di&s;tance; and the mea&s;ure of the circumference of the orbit, taken as three times its diameter, is &s;ix hundred million miles. The earth performs this voyage in 365 days and &s;ome hours, and con&s;equently moves at the rate of more than one million &s;ix hundred thou&s;and miles every twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>WHERE will infidelity, where will athei&s;m, find cau&s;e for this a&s;toni&s;hing velocity of mo|tion, never cea&s;ing, never varying, and which is the pre&s;ervation of the earth in its orbit? It is not by rea&s;oning from an acorn to an oak, from an egg to a bird, or from any change in the &s;tate of matter on the &s;urface of the earth, that this can be accounted for. Its cau&s;e is not to be found in matter, nor in any thing we call nature. The athei&s;t who affects to rea&s;on, and the fanatic who rejects rea&s;on, plunge them|&s;elves
<PB N="15" REF="13">alike into inextricable difficulties. The one perverts the &s;ublime and enlightening &s;tudy of natural philo&s;ophy into a deformity of ab|&s;urdities by not rea&s;oning to the end. The other lo&s;es him&s;elf in the ob&s;curity of metaphy|&s;ical theories, and di&s;honours the Creator, by treating the &s;tudy of his works with contempt. The one is a half-rational of whom there is &s;ome hope, the other a vi&s;ionary to whom we mu&s;t be charitable.</P>
<P>WHEN at fir&s;t thought we think of a Cre|ator, our ideas appear to us undefined and confu&s;ed; but if we rea&s;on philo&s;ophically, tho&s;e ideas can be ea&s;ily arranged and &s;implified. <HI>It is a Being, who&s;e power is equal to his will.</HI> Ob|&s;erve the nature of the will of man. It is of an infinite quality. We cannot conceive the po&s;&s;ibility of limits to the will. Ob&s;erve, on the other hand, how exceedingly limited is his power of acting compared with the nature of his will. Suppo&s;e the power equal to the will, and man would be a God. He would will him&s;elf eternal, and be &s;o. He could will a creation, and could make it. In this pro|gre&s;&s;ive rea&s;oning, we &s;ee, in the nature of the will of man, half of that which we conceive in thinking of God, add the other half and we have the whole idea of a being who could make
<PB N="16" REF="14">the univer&s;e, and &s;u&s;tain it by perpetual mo|tion; becau&s;e he could create that motion.</P>
<P>WE know nothing of the capacity of the will of animals; but we know a great deal of the difference of their powers. For example, how numerous are the degrees, and how im|men&s;e is the difference of power, from a mite to a man. Since then every thing we &s;ee below us &s;hews a progre&s;&s;ion of power, where is the difficulty in &s;uppo&s;ing that there is at the <HI>&s;ummit of all things,</HI> a Being, in whom an infinity of power unites with the infinity of the will. When this &s;imple idea pre&s;ents it&s;elf to our mind, we have the idea of a perfect being that man calls God.</P>
<P>IT is comfortable to live under the belief of the exi&s;tence of an infinitely protecting power; and it is an addition to that comfort to know, that &s;uch a belief is not a mere conceit of the imagi|nation, as many of the theories that are called religious are; nor a belief founded only on tra|dition or received opinion, but is a belief dedu|cible by the action of rea&s;on upon the things that compo&s;e the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e; a belief ari&s;ing out of vi&s;ible facts, and &s;o demon&s;tra|ble is the truth of this belief, that if no &s;uch belief had exi&s;ted the per&s;ons who now con|trovert
<PB N="17" REF="15">it, would have been the per&s;ons who would have produced and propagated it; be|cau&s;e by beginning to rea&s;on, they would have been led to rea&s;on progre&s;&s;ively to the end, and thereby have di&s;covered that matter and the properties it has, will not account for the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, and that there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be a &s;uperior cau&s;e.</P>
<P>IT was the exce&s;s to which imaginary &s;y&s;|tems of religion had been carried, and the in|tolerance, per&s;ecutions, burnings, and ma&s;&s;a|cres, they occa&s;ioned, that fir&s;t induced certain per&s;ons to propagate infidelity; thinking, that upon the whole, it was better not to believe at all, than to believe a multitude of things and complicated creeds, that occa&s;ioned &s;o much mi&s;chief in the world. But tho&s;e days are pa&s;t, per&s;ecution has cea&s;ed, and the antidote then &s;et up again&s;t it has no longer even the &s;hadow of apology. We profe&s;s, and we proclaim in peace, the pure, unmixed, comfortable, and rational belief of a God, as manife&s;ted, to us in the univer&s;e. We do this without any ap|prehen&s;ion of that belief being made a cau&s;e of per&s;ecution as other beliefs have been, or of &s;uffering per&s;ecution our&s;elves. To God, and not to man, are all men to account for their belief.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="16">IT has been well ob&s;erved at the fir&s;t in|&s;titution of this &s;ociety, that the dogmas it pro|fe&s;&s;es to believe, are from the commencement of the world; that they are not novelties, but are confe&s;&s;edly the ba&s;is of all &s;y&s;tems of reli|gion, however numerous and contradictory they may be. All men in the out&s;et of the religion they profe&s;s, are Theophilanthropi&s;ts. It is impo&s;&s;ible to form any &s;y&s;tem of religion without building upon tho&s;e principles, and therefore they are not &s;ectarian principles un|le&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e a &s;ect compo&s;ed of all the world.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid in the cour&s;e of this di&s;cour&s;e, that the &s;tudy of natural philo&s;ophy is a divine &s;tudy, becau&s;e it is the &s;tudy of the works of God in the creation. If we con&s;ider theology upon this ground what an exten&s;ive field of improvement in things both divine and human opens it&s;elf be|fore us. All the principles of &s;cience are of divine origin. It was not man that invented the prin|ciples on which a&s;tronomy, and every branch of mathematics are founded and &s;tudied. It was not man that gave properties to the circle and the triangle. Tho&s;e principles are eter|nal and immutable. We &s;ee in them the un|changeable nature of the divinity. We &s;ee in them immortality, an immortality exi&s;ting after
<PB N="19" REF="17">the material figures that expre&s;s tho&s;e proper|ties and di&s;&s;olved in du&s;t.</P>
<P>THE &s;ociety is at pre&s;ent in its infancy, and its means are &s;mall; but I wi&s;h to hold in view the &s;ubject I allude to, and in&s;tead of teaching the philo&s;ophical branches of learning as ornamental accompli&s;hments only, as they have hitherto been taught, to teach them in a manner that &s;hall combine theological know|ledge with &s;cientific in&s;truction. To do this to the be&s;t advantage, &s;ome in&s;truments will be nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e of explanation, of which the &s;ociety is not yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; but as the views of this &s;ociety extend to public good as well as to that of the individual, and as its principles can have no enemies, means may be devi&s;ed to procure them.</P>
<P>IF we unite to the pre&s;ent in&s;truction, a &s;eries of lectures on the ground I have mentioned, we &s;hall, in the fir&s;t place, render theology the mo&s;t delightful and entertaining of all &s;tudies. In the next place, we &s;hall give &s;cien|tific in&s;truction to tho&s;e who could not other|wi&s;e obtain it. The mechanic of every pro|fe&s;&s;ion will there be taught the mathematical principles nece&s;&s;ary to render him a proficient
<PB N="20" REF="18">in his art. The cultivator will there &s;ee deve|loped the principles of vegetation; while, at the &s;ame time, they will be led to &s;ee the hand of God in all the&s;e things.</P>
