<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE ODE</HEAD>
<P><HI>SAUL,</HI> for his Di&s;obedience to Heaven, is afflicted
with the Fiend of <HI>MELANCHOLY, p. 5. DAVID</HI> is &s;ent for, to cure him
by the Power of Mu&s;ic, <HI>p. 6.</HI> He comes, attended with a Choir of
Shepherds; and, as the means of di&s;pelling <HI>SAUL's</HI> De&s;pair, he
&s;ings the Creation of the World, and the happy E&s;tate of our fir&s;t
Parents in Paradi&s;e, <HI>ib. to 9. SAUL</HI> is moved by the
Repre&s;entation; but expo&s;tulates with DAVID, "why, when others are happy,
He &s;hould be mi&s;erable" <HI>p. 10. DAVID,</HI> to convince him that Guilt
is the Source of Mi&s;ery, &s;ings the Fall of Man, and his Expul&s;ion from
Paradi&s;e, <HI>ib.</HI> This alarms the Monarch's Pride; and in&s;tead of
reclaiming, provokes him to Re&s;entment and Rage, <HI>p. 11. DAVID,</HI>
&s;uperior to his Threats, awakens his Con&s;cience, and terrifies him, by
&s;inging the Fate and Puni&s;hment of Guilt, in the De&s;truction of the
rebellious Tribe of <HI>CHORAH</HI> by an Earthquake, and of the guilty World
by the general <PB N="iv" REF="4"> Deluge, <HI>p. 11, 12, 13. SAUL,</HI>
&s;truck with Horror, attempts to kill him&s;elf, <HI>p. 14.</HI> But being
prevented by his Friends, <HI>DAVID</HI> &s;ooths his Angui&s;h, by invoking
Repentance and divine Mercy to compo&s;e his Pa&s;&s;ions, <HI>p. 14. SAUL</HI>
relents into virtuous Sorrow, <HI>p. 15.</HI> But his De&s;pair returning,
<HI>DAVID</HI> calls on his at|tendant Choir to rai&s;e a more &s;ublime and
affecting Strain, <HI>p. 16.</HI> This hath its Effect; and <HI>SAUL</HI> melts
into Tears of Penitence, <HI>ib. DAVID</HI> now comforts him with the Return of
the divine Favour, <HI>p. 17.</HI> To bani&s;h the Remains of Pride, he then
&s;ings his own Happine&s;s in the humble Station of a Shepherd, <HI>ib.</HI>
Still farther to compo&s;e the Monarch's Griefs, by a Strain of &s;oft Mu&s;ic
he throws him into a gentle Slumber; invoking cele&s;tial vi&s;ions to
tran&s;port him to the Regions of the Ble&s;&s;ed, and change his Angui&s;h
into Joy, <HI>p. 18.</HI> The de&s;ired Effects appear in his Countenance: The
Fiend departs: And <HI>SAUL</HI> awakes in perfect Tranquillity, <HI>p. 18.
DAVID</HI> then con|cludes with a Song of Triumph on the Powers of Harmony, and
the &s;eraphic Hymn that attended her, as the Mini&s;ter of Heaven, on the
Creation of the World, <HI>p. 19.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. The propo&s;ed Method of Inquiry.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER is founded in &s;uch <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> and
<HI>Principles</HI> of Action, as are <HI>common</HI> to the whole
<HI>Race</HI> of <HI>Man,</HI> will be mo&s;t effectually inve&s;tigated, as to
its <HI>Origin</HI> and <HI>Progre&s;s,</HI> by viewing Man in his
<HI>&s;avage</HI> or <HI>uncultivated</HI> State. Here, before Education and
Art have ca&s;t their Veil over the human Mind, its various Powers throw
them&s;elves out, and all its Workings pre&s;ent them|&s;elves in&s;tantly, and
without Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>It may be affirmed with Truth, that, for Want of begin|ning our
Inquiries at this early and neglected Period, and by viewing Man under his
State of <HI>Civilization</HI> only, many curious and intere&s;ting Que&s;tions
have been left involved in Darkne&s;s, which might have been clearly unfolded
by a free and full Re&s;earch into the Pa&s;&s;ions, Propen&s;ities, and
Qualities of <HI>&s;avage</HI> Man.</P>
<P>This the Writer hopes to make appear in a more <HI>exten|&s;ive

delivered will make an incidental Part. In the mean Time, he intends to treat
the pre&s;ent Subject in the Way now propo&s;ed, by deducing his Argument from
the fir&s;t great and original Fountain of <HI>&s;avage Life</HI> and

<HEAD>SECT. III. Of Mu&s;ic, Dance, and Poem, in the &s;avage
State.</HEAD>
<P>BY examining &s;avage Life, where untaught Nature rules, we find
that the <HI>agreeable Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of Love, Pity, Hope, Joy, and
Exultation, no le&s;s than their <HI>Con|traries</HI> of Hate, Revenge, Fear,
Sorrow, and De&s;pair, op|pre&s;&s;ing the human Heart by their mighty Force,
are thrown out by the three Powers of <HI>Action, Voice,</HI> and
<HI>articulate Sounds.</HI> The <HI>Brute</HI> Creatures expre&s;s their
Pa&s;&s;ions by the two fir&s;t of The&s;e; &s;ome by <HI>Action,</HI> &s;ome
by <HI>Voice,</HI> and &s;ome by <HI>both</HI> united: Beyond the&s;e,
<HI>Man</HI> has the added Power of <HI>articulate Speech:</HI> The &s;ame
Force of <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> and <HI>Fancy</HI> which gives him <HI>higher
Degrees</HI> and a <HI>wider Variety</HI> of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> gives ri&s;e
to this <HI>additional Power</HI> of expre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions which
he feels.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Savages</HI> who are in the <HI>lowe&s;t Scale</HI> of
the human Kind, the&s;e &s;everal Modes of expre&s;&s;ing their Pa&s;&s;ions
are found altogether &s;uited to their wretched State. Their
<HI>Ge&s;tures</HI> are <HI>uncouth</HI> and <HI>horrid:</HI> Their
<HI>Voice</HI> is thrown out in <HI>Howls</HI> and <HI>Roarings:</HI> Their
<HI>Language</HI> is like the <HI>Gabbling of Gee&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But if we a&s;cend a Step or two higher in the Scale of &s;avage
Life, we &s;hall find this <HI>Chaos</HI> of <HI>Ge&s;ture, Voice,</HI> and
<HI>Speech,</HI> ri&s;ing into an agreeable <HI>Order</HI> and
<HI>Proportion.</HI> The natural Love of a <HI>mea&s;ured Melody,</HI> which
Time and Ex|perience produce, throws the <HI>Voice</HI> into <HI>Song,</HI> the
<HI>Ge&s;ture</HI> into <HI>Dance,</HI> the <HI>Speech</HI> into
<HI>Ver&s;e</HI> or <HI>Numbers.</HI> The Ad|dition of mu&s;ical
<HI>In&s;truments</HI> comes of Cour&s;e: They are <PB N="28" REF="27"> but
<HI>Imitations</HI> of the human Voice, or of other natural Sounds, produced
gradually by frequent Trial and Ex|periment.</P>
<P>Such is the Generation and natural Alliance of the&s;e three
<HI>Si&s;ter-Graces, Mu&s;ic, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Poem,</HI> which we find
moving Hand in Hand among the &s;avage Tribes of every Climate.</P>
<P>For the Truth of the Fact, we may appeal to mo&s;t of the Travellers
who de&s;cribe the Scenes of uncultivated Nature: All the&s;e agree in telling
us, that <HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song,</HI> make up the ruling
Pa&s;time, adorn the Fea&s;ts, com|po&s;e the Religion, fix the Manners,
&s;trengthen the Policy, and even form the future Paradi&s;e, of &s;avage Man.
That having few Wants, and con&s;equently much Lei&s;ure, the barbarous Tribes
addict them&s;elves to the&s;e a&s;&s;uring Arts with a wonderful Degree of
Pa&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s where their Manners are corrupted by an incidental
Commerce with the Off-&s;cum of civilized Nations. By the&s;e attractive and
powerful Arts they celebrate their public Solemnities; by the&s;e they lament
their private and public Calamities, the Death of Friends, or the Lo&s;s of
Warriors: By the&s;e united, they expre&s;s their Joy on their Marriages,
Har|ve&s;ts, Huntings, Victories; prai&s;e the great Actions of their Gods and
Heroes; excite each other to War and brave Exploits, or to &s;uffer Death and
Torments with un|&s;haken Con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Circum&s;tances mo&s;t <HI>common</HI> to the
&s;avage Tribes: Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are many <HI>peculiar</HI> Modes,
which ari&s;e from their different Climates, Situations, Opi|nions, Manners.
Among &s;ome Tribes the <HI>joyous</HI> Pa&s;&s;ions, <PB N="29" REF="28">
among &s;ome the <HI>gentle,</HI> among others the <HI>ferocious,</HI>
pre|dominate and take Place. To give all the Varieties of the&s;e &s;avage and
fe&s;tal Solemnities, were an endle&s;s Labour. Let the following Account
&s;uffice, as a general Image of the re&s;t; which is &s;ingled out, not only
becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t circum&s;tantial; but likewi&s;e for the particular
Relation which it will be found to bear to a following Part of this
Inquiry.</P>
<P>The IROQUOIS, HURONS, and &s;ome le&s;s con&s;iderable Tribes, are
free and independent Savages, who inhabit the northern Continent of AMERICA;
and extend their Set|tlements from the Back of the <HI>Briti&s;h Colonies</HI>
to the Bor|ders of the <HI>Great Lakes,</HI> along the Skirts of LOUISIANA, and
down the River OHIO, towards the MISSISIPI, and the Gulph of FLORIDA. Father
LAFITAU<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Moeurs des Sauvages,</HI> tom. ii. p.
213, &amp;c. 12^m^o.</BIBL></NOTE> gives the following De&s;cription of their
fe&s;tal Solemnities; which it is nece&s;&s;ary to tran&s;cribe at large, in
order to give an adequate Idea of their Manners and Character.</P>
<Q> 
<P> "On the appointed Day, early in the Morning, they prepare the
Fea&s;t in the <HI>Council-Cabbin,</HI> and there they di&s;po&s;e all Things
for the A&s;&s;embly.&mdash;In the mean|time, a public Crier goes through the
Village, and gives Notice that the <HI>Kettle</HI> is hung on in &s;uch a
Cabbin: The common People, and even the Chiefs, bring with them their
<HI>little Kettle.</HI> It doth not appear, that there is any Di&s;tinction of
Ranks among them, except that the <HI>old Men</HI> occupy the foremo&s;t Matts.
The IRO|QUOISE <HI>Women</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;t not, that I know of, at the&s;e Kind
of Fea&s;ts; nor are they invited. The <HI>Children,</HI> and 
<PB N="30" REF="29"> <HI>young Men,</HI> who are not as yet cho&s;en into the
Body of Warriors, mount upon the Scaffolds which are placed over the Matts, and
even upon the Roof of the Cabbin it&s;elf, and look down through the Hole at
which the Smoke goes out."</P> 
<P> "While the A&s;&s;embly is forming, He who makes the Fea&s;t, or He
in who&s;e Name it is made, <HI>&s;ings alone.</HI>&mdash;The De&s;ign of this
is to entertain the Company, on &s;uch Things as have Relation to the Subject
on which they a&s;&s;emble. The&s;e <HI>Songs,</HI> for the mo&s;t Part, are
fill|ed with the <HI>Fables</HI> of <HI>ancient Times,</HI> the <HI>heroic
Deeds</HI> of their <HI>Nation</HI>; and are compo&s;ed in an <HI>antiquated
Style</HI>; &s;o old, that often they under&s;tand not what they &s;ay. The
Singer hath &s;ometimes an A&s;&s;i&s;tant, who relieves him when he is
fatigued: For they &s;ing with all their Force."</P> 
<P> "The Speaker then opens the Scene, by a&s;king in Form, if all who
are invited are come. He then names the Per&s;on who makes the Fea&s;t, he
declares the Occa&s;ion on which it is made, and enters into a particular
Detail of all that is in the Kettle. At every thing which he names, the whole
Choir replies by a repeated Shout of Approbation."</P> 
<P> "The Speaker then gives an Account of every thing, which it is of
Importance that the Public &s;hould know. For the&s;e <HI>Song-Fea&s;ts,</HI>
being made on all <HI>weighty Occa|&s;ions</HI> which regard the
<HI>Village</HI> or the <HI>Nation</HI>; this is the proper Time for public
Affairs, as that of renewing a <HI>Name,</HI> hearing <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors,</HI>
or <HI>proclaiming War</HI> by <HI>Song.</HI>"</P> 
<P><PB N="31" REF="30"> "When the Orator hath done &s;peaking,
&s;ometimes they begin to eat before they &s;ing, that they may have the better
Spirits: Sometimes they &s;ing before they eat: If the Fea&s;t is to continue
for the whole Day, the Kettle is in Part empty'd in the Morning, and in Part
re&s;erved for the Evening; and in the Intervals they <HI>&s;ing</HI> and
<HI>dance.</HI>"</P> 
<P> "The Ma&s;ter of the Fea&s;t touches nothing. He bu&s;ies him&s;elf
only in &s;eeing that the Company be &s;erved, or in &s;erving them him&s;elf;
naming aloud the Pieces which he de&s;tines and pre&s;ents to each. The be&s;t
Mor&s;els are given, by Way of Preference, to tho&s;e whom he chu&s;eth to
di&s;tingui&s;h."</P> 
<P> "After the Repa&s;t, the Ma&s;ter of the Fea&s;t begins the
<HI>Athonront,</HI> a <HI>Song and Dance</HI> peculiar to the <HI>Men.</HI>
They relieve each other, by beginning with tho&s;e of <HI>mo&s;t
Con&s;ideration,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing gradually down to the
<HI>Young|e&s;t.</HI> They have that Civility and Attention to each other, that
every one waits till another of &s;uperior Dig|nity enters the Li&s;ts, and
takes the Lead."</P> 
<P> "The <HI>Ancients</HI> and Men of Dignity often do no more than
<HI>ri&s;e</HI> from their Seats; and content them&s;elves, while they
<HI>&s;ing,</HI> with making &s;ome <HI>Inflexions</HI> with their Head,
Shoulders, and Knees, in order to <HI>accompany</HI> and <HI>&s;u&s;tain</HI>
their <HI>Song.</HI> Others &s;omewhat le&s;s grave, take a few Steps, and walk
along the Cabin around the Fires. Every one hath his particular <HI>Song</HI>;
that is, an <HI>Air,</HI> to which he <HI>adju&s;ts</HI> a very few
<HI>Words,</HI> which he repeats as often as he plea&s;eth. I have ob&s;erved,
that they even <HI>retrench</HI> <PB N="32" REF="31"> or <HI>&s;trike off</HI>
&s;ome <HI>Syllables</HI> from their Words, as if they were <HI>Ver&s;es,</HI>
or <HI>mea&s;ured</HI> Words, but <HI>without Rhyme.</HI>"</P> 
<P> "He who means to dance, begins by ri&s;ing from his Matt; and the
whole Company an&s;wers him by a gene|ral Shout of Approbation: As he
pa&s;&s;eth along before every Fire, they who &s;it on each Side <HI>beat</HI>
the <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI> or <HI>Cadence</HI> of his <HI>Song</HI> by a
corre&s;pondent Motion of the Head; and by throwing out continual Shouts which
they redouble at certain Times, where the Mea&s;ure de|mands it, with &s;o much
Truth, that they never err; and with &s;uch a Delicacy of Ear, as the
<HI>French,</HI> who are mo&s;t practi&s;ed in their Cu&s;toms, cannot attain
to. When he pa&s;&s;eth to a &s;econd Fire, They of the fir&s;t take Breath:
They of the more di&s;tant Fires are likewi&s;e &s;ilent: But the <HI>Time</HI>
is always <HI>beat</HI> by tho&s;e before who&s;e Fire he &s;ings and dances.
The Song concludes by a general <HI>Ehoue!</HI> of the whole Choir; which is a
&s;econd Shout of Approbation."</P> 
<P> "The <HI>young</HI> Men have their <HI>Songs</HI> of a more
<HI>lively,</HI> and their <HI>Dances</HI> of a more <HI>vigorous</HI> Ca&s;t;
&s;uch as are &s;uit|able to their Age. When the Dance is much animated, they
dance two or three together, each at his own Fire: Nor does this Mixture ever
occa&s;ion any Confu&s;ion."</P> 
<P> "Among the&s;e Dances, <HI>&s;ome</HI> are no more than a
<HI>&s;imple</HI> and <HI>noble</HI> Manner of <HI>marching</HI> up to an
<HI>Enemy</HI>; and of <HI>facing Danger</HI> with <HI>Intrepidity</HI> and
<HI>Gaiety</HI> of Mind."</P> 
<P> "A &s;econd Sort of Dance, but &s;till of the &s;ame Kind, is that
of the <HI>Pantomimes:</HI> Which con&s;i&s;ts in repre&s;enting an Action in
the Manner in which it pa&s;&s;ed, or &s;uch as they conceive it to have been.
Many of tho&s;e who have <PB N="33" REF="32"> lived among the IROQUOIS, have
a&s;&s;ured me, that after a Chief of War hath circum&s;tantially recounted, at
his Return, all that had pa&s;&s;ed in the Expeditions he had undertaken, and
the Battles he had fought, they who are pre&s;ent at the Recital often ri&s;e
on the &s;udden to dance, and repre&s;ent tho&s;e Actions with great Vivacity,
as if they had been pre&s;ent: And all this, without any pre|vious Concert or
Preparation."</P> 
<P> "In their <HI>Songs</HI> they <HI>prai&s;e</HI> not only their
<HI>Gods</HI> and <HI>Heroes,</HI> but they likewi&s;e prai&s;e
<HI>them&s;elves:</HI> In this they are not &s;paring: and are even
<HI>prodigal</HI> in their <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> of <HI>others,</HI> whom they
think <HI>worthy</HI> of it. He who is thus applauded, an&s;wers by a &s;hout
of Thanks, as &s;oon as he hears him&s;elf named."</P> 
<P> "They are &s;till quicker at <HI>rallying</HI> each other; and
&s;uc|ceed to a Wonder in This. He who dances, takes whom&s;oever he plea&s;eth
by the Hand, and brings him forth into the mid&s;t of the A&s;&s;embly: to
which he yields without Re&s;i&s;tance. Meanwhile the <HI>Dancer</HI>
con|tinues to <HI>&s;ing</HI>; and &s;ometimes in his <HI>Song,</HI> and
&s;ome|times in the <HI>Intervals,</HI> he throws his <HI>Sarca&s;ms</HI> on
the Patient, who hears him without Reply.&mdash;At every <HI>Bon Mot,</HI> loud
<HI>Peals</HI> of <HI>Laughter</HI> ari&s;e along the <HI>Galleries,</HI> who
<HI>animate</HI> this <HI>Sport,</HI> and often oblige the Patient to cover his
Head in his Mantle."</P> 
<P> "They have another Kind of <HI>Dance,</HI> in which the whole
<HI>Choir</HI> dances: and this is common both to Men and Wo|men. As this is
very different from the preceeding ones, they do not u&s;e it in their
<HI>Song-Fea&s;ts.</HI> Their Pretenders <PB N="34" REF="33"> to Magic<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Charlatans,</HI>&mdash;a Word with which we have none
preci&s;ely corre&s;pon|dent in our Language: It &s;ignifies here, one who is a
Pretender to <HI>Mede|cine</HI> by the Arts of <HI>Magic.</HI></NOTE> often
ordain it as an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> for the <HI>healing</HI> of
the <HI>Sick:</HI> it is al&s;o one of their Modes of <HI>Di|vination.</HI> It
is likewi&s;e practi&s;ed, at Times, as a mere Exerci&s;e of
<HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> at the Fea&s;ts and Solemnities of the Village. The Manner
is as follows. Notice is given early in the Morning through all the Cabins, for
the Performance of this Ceremony: Every Cabin de|putes a certain Number, either
of Men or Women, who dre&s;s them&s;elves in all their Finery, that they may go
and perform their Part. They all appear at the ap|pointed Hour (which is
proclaimed by a public Crier) either in the Council-Cabin, or &s;ome other
Place de&s;tined for the Purpo&s;e. In the middle of the Place or Cabin they
build a little Scaffold; and on this they rai&s;e a &s;mall Seat for the
<HI>Singers</HI> who are to <HI>accompany</HI> and <HI>animate</HI> the
<HI>Dance.</HI> One holds in his Hand a <HI>Tambour</HI> or little
<HI>Drum,</HI> the other a <HI>Tortoi&s;e Shell.</HI> While the&s;e &s;ing, and
accompany their Song with the Sound of their In&s;tru|ments (which is farther
Strengthened by the Spectators, who beat with little Sticks upon the
<HI>Kettles</HI> that are before them) they who dance, go round in a circular
Movement; but without taking Hands, as they do in Europe. Each Dancer makes
various Motions with his Feet and Hands, as he plea&s;eth: And though all the
Movements are different, according to the Whim and Caprice of their
Imagination, none of them ever lo&s;e the <HI>Time.</HI> They who are mo&s;t
expert in varying their <PB N="35" REF="34"> Po&s;tures, and throwing
them&s;elves into Action, are reckoned to excel the re&s;t. The Dance is
compo&s;ed of &s;everal <HI>Returns:</HI> Each <HI>Return</HI> la&s;ts till the
Dancers are out of Breath; and after a &s;hort Interval of <HI>Repo&s;e,</HI>
they begin <HI>another.</HI> Nothing can be more animated than the&s;e
Movements: To &s;ee them, one would &s;ay, they were a Troop of furious and
frantic People. What mu&s;t fatigue them &s;till more is, that not only by
their Move|ment but likewi&s;e with their Voice, they follow the Sing|ers and
their In&s;truments to the End of each <HI>Return</HI>; which is always
clo&s;ed by a general and loud <HI>Oueh!</HI> which is a Shout of Approbation,
implying that the <HI>Re|turn</HI> hath been well performed."</P> 
<P> "Athough I have not &s;poken particularly of any Na|tions but
tho&s;e of the IROQUOIS and HURONS, yet I may truly &s;ay, that I have
de&s;cribed, at the &s;ame Time, <HI>all</HI> the other barbarous Nations of
AMERICA, as to what is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> and <HI>principal.</HI> For
though there ap|pears to be a great Difference between the <HI>Monarchic</HI>
and <HI>Oligarchic</HI> State, yet the Genius of their &s;avage Po|licy is
every where the &s;ame: We find the &s;ame Turn for public Affairs, the &s;ame
Method of conducting them, the &s;ame U&s;e of &s;ecret and &s;olemn
A&s;&s;emblies, the &s;ame Character in their <HI>Fea&s;ts,</HI> their
<HI>Dances,</HI> and their <HI>Di|ver&s;ions.</HI>"</P> 
<P> "The <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> and <HI>Dance</HI> of the <HI>Americans</HI>

and of which no Idea can be formed by tho&s;e who have not &s;een and heard
them. We grow recon|ciled to them by Degrees, and in the End partake of them
with Plea&s;ure. As to the Savages them&s;elves, they <PB N="36" REF="35"> are
fond of the&s;e Fea&s;ts even to Di&s;traction. They con|tinue them whole Days

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Of the natural Con&s;equences of a &s;uppo&s;ed
Civilization.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the&s;e free and warlike Savages continue in their pre&s;ent
<HI>unlettered</HI> State of Ignorance and Simplicity, no material Improvements
in their <HI>Song-Fea&s;ts</HI> can ari&s;e. But let us &s;uppo&s;e that the
U&s;e of <HI>Letters</HI> &s;hould come among them, and, as a Cau&s;e or
Con&s;equence of <HI>Civilization,</HI> be cultivated with that Spirit which is
natural to a free and active People; and many notable Con&s;equences would
appear. Let us con&s;ider the mo&s;t probable and &s;triking among the&s;e
natural Effects.</P>
<P N="1">1. Their Idea of <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> in its mo&s;t
<HI>inlarged</HI> Sen&s;e, would comprehend the three Circum&s;tances of
<HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI> For the&s;e three, as we have
&s;een, being na|turally conjoined, becau&s;e naturally producing each other,
would not <HI>&s;eparately</HI> command the Attention of &s;uch a People at
their public Fe&s;tivals. Therefore <HI>In&s;trumental Melody,</HI> without
<HI>Song,</HI> would be little attended to, and of <HI>no E&s;teem</HI>;
becau&s;e it would want all tho&s;e Attractions which mu&s;t ari&s;e from the
corre&s;pondent <HI>Dance</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="37" REF="36">2. In the early Periods of &s;uch a
Commonwealth, the <HI>Chiefs</HI> or <HI>Legi&s;lators</HI> would often be the
<HI>principal Mu&s;icians.</HI> The two Characters would commonly coale&s;ce;
for we find, that, among the &s;avage Tribes, the <HI>Chiefs</HI> are they who
mo&s;t &s;ignalize them&s;elves by <HI>Dance</HI> and <HI>Song</HI>; and that
their <HI>Songs</HI> rowl principally on the <HI>great Actions</HI> and
<HI>Events</HI> which concern their <HI>own Nation.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Hence, their mo&s;t ancient <HI>Gods</HI> would naturally
be &s;tyled <HI>Singers</HI> and <HI>Dancers.</HI> For the mo&s;t ancient
<HI>Gods</HI> of civilized Pagan Countries, are generally their early
<HI>Legi&s;lators,</HI> who taught their People the fir&s;t Arts of Life.
The&s;e decea&s;ed Legi&s;lators, therefore, when advanced to the Rank of Gods,
would naturally be delivered down to Po&s;terity with the &s;ame Attributes and
Qualities by which they had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in Life: And it
ap|pears, from the la&s;t Article, that the&s;e Qualities would naturally be
tho&s;e of <HI>Dance</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Mea&s;ured Periods, or in other Words, <HI>Rythm,
Num|bers,</HI> and <HI>Ver&s;e,</HI> would naturally ari&s;e. For mea&s;ured
Cadence, or <HI>Time,</HI> is an e&s;&s;ential Part of Melody, into which the
human Ear naturally falls. And as the &s;ame Force of Ear would lead the Action
or Dance to cor|re&s;pond with the Melody, &s;o the Words or Song mu&s;t, on a
like Principle, keep Pace with <HI>Both.</HI> Among the <HI>&s;a|vage
Americans</HI> we &s;ee the fir&s;t Rudiments of poetic Numbers, emerging from
this Source. For 
<Q REND="inline">"as the Means of adju&s;ting the Words to the Air or
Melody, they &s;ometimes &s;trike off Syllables from their Words."</Q> And
&s;uch is the natural Generation of <HI>Rythm</HI> and <HI>Ver&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Their earlie&s;t <HI>Hi&s;tories</HI> would be written in
<HI>Ver&s;e.</HI> For we &s;ee, that among the &s;avage Tribes, the Actions of 
<PB N="38" REF="37"> their Heroes and Gods, and the great Events of their
Nation, make a principal Part of their Songs. When|ever, therefore, the U&s;e
of Letters &s;hould come among &s;uch a People, the&s;e <HI>ancient Songs</HI>
would naturally be <HI>fir&s;t recorded,</HI> for the Information and U&s;e of
future Times.</P>
<P N="6">6. Their mo&s;t ancient <HI>Maxims, Exhortations,
Proverbs,</HI> or <HI>Laws,</HI> would probably be written in Ver&s;e. For
the&s;e would naturally make a Part of their <HI>Songs</HI> of Celebration, and
would by Degrees be <HI>&s;elected</HI> from thence, would in Time become the
<HI>Standard</HI> of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong,</HI> and as &s;uch, be
trea&s;ured up and appealed to by the improving Tribe.</P>
<P N="7">7. Their <HI>religious Rites</HI> would naturally be performed
or accompany'd by <HI>Dance</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI> For it appears from Fact
that the great Actions of their Gods and Heroes are the mo&s;t general Subject
of the &s;avage Dance and Song; and the common End of Pagan Rites hath ever
been, to prai&s;e the Gods of the Country, and by the&s;e Means (as well as by
Sacrifice) to appea&s;e their Wrath, or &s;ecure their Favour.</P>
<P N="8">8. Their <HI>earlie&s;t Oracles</HI> would probably be
delivered in <HI>Ver&s;e,</HI> and <HI>&s;ung</HI> by the Prie&s;t or
Prie&s;te&s;s of the &s;uppo&s;ed God. For the&s;e <HI>Oracles,</HI> being
&s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>in&s;pired</HI> by a decea&s;ed <HI>Chief</HI> (now a
<HI>Deity)</HI> who had him&s;elf delivered his Exhortations in this
<HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tic Manner</HI>; and being ad|dre&s;&s;ed to a Tribe among
whom this Mode of In&s;truction univer&s;ally prevailed, no other Vehicle but
that of <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> and <HI>Song</HI> could at fir&s;t gain the&s;e
<HI>Oracles</HI> either <HI>Credit</HI> or <HI>Reception.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Their <HI>Melody</HI> would be <HI>&s;imple</HI>; and
derive a con&s;ider|able Part of its Power from its <HI>Rythm</HI> or
<HI>Mea&s;ure,</HI> without <PB N="39" REF="38"> any Mixture of <HI>artificial
Compo&s;ition.</HI> Fir&s;t, becau&s;e this Kind would be mo&s;t &s;uited to
the <HI>Powers</HI> of the barbarous <HI>Legi&s;lators</HI> or <HI>Bards,</HI>
at once <HI>Compo&s;ers</HI> and <HI>Performers,</HI> among whom nothing
artificial or refined could as yet take Place. Secondly, becau&s;e this
<HI>Simplicity</HI> of Manner would be be&s;t adapted to the Capacity of the
&s;urrounding People, incapable, in this early Period, to be attracted or moved
by any thing but what <HI>Nature</HI> dictates.</P>
<P N="10">10. The Force of this &s;imple Melody would be much
increa&s;ed by the Power of early <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> and continued
<HI>Habit.</HI> For this, by <HI>appropriating</HI> certain <HI>Sounds</HI> to
certain <HI>Subjects,</HI> would rai&s;e their Melody into a Kind of natural
and expre&s;&s;ive Language of the Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P N="11">11. Their <HI>Songs</HI> would be of a <HI>legi&s;lative</HI>
Ca&s;t; and being drawn chiefly from the Fables or Hi&s;tory of their own
Country, would contain the e&s;&s;ential Parts of their <HI>religious,
moral,</HI> and <HI>political</HI> Sy&s;tems. For we have &s;een above, that
the <HI>Celebration</HI> of their decea&s;ed Heroes would of Cour&s;e grow into
a <HI>religious</HI> Act: That the <HI>Exhortations</HI> and <HI>Maxims</HI>
intermixed with the&s;e Celebrations, and found|ed on the <HI>Example</HI> of
their <HI>Heroe-Gods,</HI> would naturally become the <HI>Standard</HI> of
<HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong</HI>; that is, the Foundation of <HI>private
Morals</HI> and <HI>public Law:</HI> And thus, the whole Fabric of their
<HI>Religion, Morals,</HI> and <HI>Polity,</HI> would naturally ari&s;e from,
and be included in their <HI>Songs,</HI> during their Progre&s;s from &s;avage
to civilized Life.</P>
<P N="12">12. MUSIC, in the extended Sen&s;e of the Word (that is,
including Melody, Dance, and Song) would make an e&s;|&s;ential and principal
Part in the <HI>Education</HI> of their Chil|dren. For the important Principles
of their <HI>Religion, Morals,</HI> and <HI>Polity,</HI> being delivered and
inculcated in their <PB N="40" REF="39"> <HI>Songs,</HI> no other Method could
be devi&s;ed, which would &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;s the youthful Mind with the
<HI>approved Principles</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. MUSIC therefore (in this extended Sen&s;e) mu&s;t gain a
great and <HI>univer&s;al Power</HI> over the minds and Actions of &s;uch a
People. For through the Force of early and conti|nued <HI>Habit,</HI> together
with the irre&s;i&s;tible Contagion of general <HI>Example,</HI> while every
thing plea&s;ing, great, and im|portant, was conveyed through this Medium, and
through this only, &s;uch &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ions would &s;trike them&s;elves
into the growing Mind, as would give it its ruling Colour through Life, and
&s;uch as no future Incidents could ea&s;ily weaken or efface.</P>
<P N="14">14. In the Cour&s;e of Time, and the Progre&s;s of Polity and
Arts, a <HI>Separation</HI> of the &s;everal Parts or Branches of Mu&s;ic (in
its extended Sen&s;e) would naturally ari&s;e. Till a certain Period of
Civilization, Letters, and Art, the &s;eve|ral Kinds would of cour&s;e lie
confu&s;ed, in a Sort of un|di&s;tingui&s;hed Ma&s;s, and be mingled in the
&s;ame Compo&s;i|tion, as Inclination, Enthu&s;ia&s;m, or other Incidents might
impel. But repeated Trial and Experiment would natu|rally produce a more
artificial Manner; and thus, by De|grees, the &s;everal Kinds of Poem would
a&s;&s;ume their legi|timate Forms.</P>
<P N="15">15. If their warlike Character continued, the <HI>Dance</HI>
would naturally <HI>&s;eparate</HI> from the <HI>Song</HI>; and would it&s;elf
become a <HI>di&s;tinct Exerci&s;e</HI> or <HI>Art,</HI> for the &s;ake of
increa&s;ing their Strength and Agility of Body, as the Means of ren|dering
them invincible in War. For the Dance or Action of their Song-Fea&s;ts, being
only &s;econdary, and merely an Appendage to the Song, would not be of a
Character &s;uffi|ciently <PB N="41" REF="40"> &s;evere for the fierce and
&s;tubborn Contention of tho&s;e who were de&s;tined to the immediate Toils of
warlike Service.</P>
<P N="16">16. After a certain Period of Civilization, the complex
Character of <HI>Legi&s;lator</HI> and <HI>Bard</HI> would <HI>&s;eparate,</HI>
or be &s;eldom united. For as the Society grew more populous, and the
increa&s;ing Arts of Life increa&s;ed the Labours and Cares of Government, the
<HI>mu&s;ical Art</HI> (in its extended Sen&s;e) would of cour&s;e be delegated
by the civil Magi|&s;trate, to &s;uch Men of Genius and Worth, as might apply
it to its proper Ends, the In&s;truction and Welfare of Man|kind.</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>Hymns</HI> or <HI>Odes</HI> would be compo&s;ed, and
<HI>Sung</HI> by their Compo&s;ers at their fe&s;tal Solemnities. For the&s;e,
in their &s;imple State, are but a Kind of rapturous Exclama|tions of Joy,
Grief, Triumph, or Exultation, in Con&s;e|quence of &s;ome great or
di&s;a&s;trous Action, known, alluded to, or expre&s;&s;ed: A Species of
Compo&s;ition which naturally ari&s;eth from the &s;avage Song-Fea&s;t.</P>
<P N="18">18. The <HI>Epic Poem</HI> would naturally ari&s;e, and be
&s;ung by its Compo&s;ers at their public Solemnities. For it ap|pears
above<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Article 5.</BIBL></NOTE>, that their
earlie&s;t Hi&s;tories would be writ|ten in Ver&s;e, and make a Part of their
public Song-Fea&s;ts. Now the <HI>Epic Poem</HI> is but a Kind of <HI>fabulous
Hi&s;tory,</HI> rowling chiefly on the great Actions of ancient Gods and
Heroes, and artificially compo&s;ed under certain Limi|tations with Re&s;pect
to its <HI>Manner,</HI> for the Ends of Plea|&s;ure, Admiration, and
In&s;truction.</P>
<P N="19">19. From an <HI>Union</HI> of the&s;e two, a certain rude
Outline of <HI>Tragedy</HI> would naturally ari&s;e. We may &s;ee the fir&s;t
Seeds or Principles of this Poem, in the Conduct of the &s;avage
<HI>Song-Fea&s;t.</HI> A <HI>Chief &s;ings</HI> &s;ome great Action of a 
<PB N="42" REF="41"> God or Heroe: The &s;urrounding <HI>Choir an&s;wer</HI>
him at In|tervals, by Shouts of Sympathy or concurrent Appro|bation.</P>
<P N="20">20. In Proce&s;s of Time, this barbarous Scene would improve
into a more perfect Form: In&s;tead of <HI>relating,</HI> they would probably
repre&s;ent, by Action and Song united, tho&s;e great or terrible Atchievements
which their Heroes had performed. For of this, too, we finds the Seeds or
Principles in the &s;avage State. 
<Q REND="inline">"After a Chief of War hath recounted the Battles he
had fought, they who are pre&s;ent will often ri&s;e up to dance, and
repre&s;ent tho&s;e Actions with great Vivacity."</Q> If to this we add the
u&s;ual Exclamations of the &s;urrounding Choir, we here behold the fir&s;t
<HI>rude Form of &s;avage Tragedy.</HI></P>
<P N="21">21. If the <HI>Choir</HI> &s;hould be
<HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> by general U&s;e, and &s;hould animate the Solemnity
by <HI>Dance</HI> as well as <HI>Song</HI>; the <HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and
<HI>Song</HI> would of cour&s;e <HI>regulate</HI> each other, and the
<HI>Ode</HI> or <HI>Song</HI> would fall into <HI>Stanzas</HI> of &s;ome
<HI>particular Kind.</HI> This appears from the third Article.</P>
<P N="22">22. Another Con&s;equence of an <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed
Choir</HI> would be an unvaried Adherence to the <HI>Unities</HI> of
<HI>Place</HI> and <HI>Time.</HI> For a numerous Choir, maintaining their
Station through the whole Performance, mu&s;t give &s;o forcible a Con|viction
to the Sen&s;es, of the <HI>Samene&s;s</HI> of <HI>Place,</HI> and
<HI>Short|ne&s;s</HI> of <HI>Time,</HI> that any Deviation from this apparent
Unity mu&s;t &s;hock the Imagination with an Improbability too gro&s;s to be
endured.</P>
<P N="23">23. Not only the Part of the tragic <HI>Choir,</HI> but the
<HI>Epi&s;ode</HI> or <HI>interlocutory</HI> Part would be al&s;o
<HI>&s;ung.</HI> For as the <HI>Ode</HI> and <HI>Epic</HI> would be
<HI>&s;ung</HI> from the earlie&s;t Periods; &s;o when they became
<HI>united,</HI> and by that Union formed the <PB N="43" REF="42"> tragic
Species, they of Cour&s;e maintained the &s;ame Ap|pendage of <HI>Melody,</HI>
which Nature and Cu&s;tom had already given them.</P>
<P N="24">24. While the Nation held its <HI>fierce</HI> and
<HI>warlike</HI> Cha|racter, the <HI>tragic</HI> Repre&s;entations would
chiefly turn on Subjects <HI>di&s;tre&s;sful</HI> or <HI>terrible.</HI> For
thus they would ani|mate each other to <HI>Victory</HI> and <HI>Revenge,</HI>
by a Repre&s;enta|tion of what their <HI>Friends</HI> had <HI>done</HI> and
<HI>&s;uffered.</HI> The&s;e Subjects would likewi&s;e be mo&s;t accommodated
to the natural Ta&s;te of the poetic Chiefs of &s;uch a People; who&s;e
Atchievements mu&s;t produce and abound with Events of Di&s;tre&s;s and Terror.
They al&s;o would be be&s;t &s;uited to the Genius and Ends of their State and
Polity: For as the leading View of &s;uch a fierce and warlike People mu&s;t be
to de&s;troy Pity and Fear; &s;o this would mo&s;t effectually be done, by
making them&s;elves familiar with di&s;tre&s;sful and terrible
Repre&s;entations. The gentle Pa&s;&s;ions, and le&s;s affecting Actions, which
might fill the Spectacles of a mild and peaceful Nation, would be in&s;ipid to
the Ta&s;te, and incompatible with the Character, of &s;uch a warlike
People.</P>
<P N="25">25. As their Tragedy would be intended as a <HI>vi&s;ible
Repre&s;entation</HI> of their ancient Gods and Heroes, &s;o it would be
natural for them to invent &s;ome Means of <HI>&s;trengthening</HI> the
<HI>Voice,</HI> and <HI>aggrandi&s;ing</HI> the <HI>Vi&s;age</HI> and
<HI>Per&s;on,</HI> as the means of compleating the Re&s;emblance: For in all
Savage Countries, the <HI>talle&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;tronge&s;t</HI> Men are
generally &s;elected as their <HI>Chiefs.</HI></P>
<P N="26">26. As their Tragic <HI>Poets</HI> would be <HI>Singers,</HI>
&s;o they would be <HI>Actors,</HI> and perform &s;ome capital Part in their
own Pieces for the Stage. For we &s;ee the&s;e different Cha|racters are
naturally united in the &s;avage State: There|fore, <PB N="44" REF="43"> till
&s;ome extraordinary Change in Manners and Prin|ciples &s;hould en&s;ue, this
<HI>Union</HI> would of Cour&s;e continue.</P>
<P N="27">27. <HI>Mu&s;ical Conte&s;ts</HI> would be admitted as
<HI>public Exer|ci&s;es</HI> in &s;uch a State. For we have &s;een, that the
impor|tant Articles of Religion, Morals, and Polity, would natu|rally make a
Part of their public Songs: therefore public Conte&s;ts of this Kind would be
regarded as the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t Means of rai&s;ing an Emulation of a
mo&s;t u&s;eful Na|ture; and of &s;trengthening the State, by inforcing all the
fundamental Principles of Society in the mo&s;t &s;triking and effectual
Manner.</P>
<P N="28">28. The Profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Bard</HI> or
<HI>Mu&s;ician</HI> would be held as very honourable, and of high E&s;teem. For
he would be ve&s;ted with a Kind of <HI>public Character:</HI> and if not an
original Legi&s;lator, yet &s;till he would be regarded as a
<HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> and <HI>u&s;eful Servant</HI> of the <HI>State.</HI></P>
<P N="29">29. <HI>Odes,</HI> or <HI>Hymns,</HI> would naturally make a
Part of their <HI>dome&s;tic Entertainments:</HI> and the <HI>Chiefs</HI> would
be proud to &s;ignalize them&s;elves by their Skill in <HI>Melody</HI> and
<HI>Song.</HI> For their Songs being enriched with all the great and im|portant
Subjects relative to the public State; nothing could be more &s;uitable to a
high Station in the Commonwealth, than a Proficiency in this &s;ublime and
legi&s;lative Art.</P>
<P N="30">30. When <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> had attained to this State of
relative Perfection, it would be regarded as a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary
Accom|pli&s;hment.</HI> And if any Man, or Society of Men, were unacquainted
with the Practice and Power of Mu&s;ic, their Ignorance in this Art would be
regarded as a capital De|fect: For it would imply a Deficiency in the three
great leading Articles of Education, <HI>Religion, Morals,</HI> and
<HI>Po|lity.</HI></P>
<P N="31"><PB N="45" REF="44">31. The Genius of their <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI>
would <HI>vary</HI> along with their <HI>Manners:</HI> For Manners being the
leading and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Quality of Man; All his other Ta&s;tes and
Ac|quirements naturally corre&s;pond with <HI>The&s;e</HI>; and accom|modate
them&s;elves to his Manners, as to their chief and original Cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="32">32. As a Change of Manners mu&s;t influence their Mu|&s;ic,
&s;o, by a reciprocal Action, a Change in their Mu&s;ic mu&s;t influence
Manners: For we have &s;een, that Mu&s;ic was the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed
Vehicle</HI> of all the great Principles of Education: Therefore a Change in
Mu&s;ic mu&s;t tend to bring on a Change in <HI>The&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="33">33. A Provident Community of Principles, uncommonly &s;evere,
would probably fix both the Subjects and Move|ments of Song and Dance, by Law:
This would ari&s;e from their Knowledge of the mutual Influence of Man|ners and
Mu&s;ic on each other.</P>
<P N="34">34. In a Society of more libertine and relaxed Princi|ples,
the Corruption of Mu&s;ic would naturally ari&s;e, along with the Corruption of
Manners; for the Rea&s;ons now a&s;&s;igned: and the Mu&s;icians, Bards, or
Poets, would be the immediate In&s;truments of this Corruption. For being
educated in a corrupt State they would be apt to deba&s;e their Art to vile and
immoral Purpo&s;es, as the means of gaining that Applau&s;e which would be the
natural Ob|ject of their Ambition.</P>
<P N="35">35. In Con&s;equence of this Corruption, a gradual and total
<HI>Separation</HI> of the <HI>Bard's</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;ician's</HI> complex
Cha|racter would en&s;ue. For the <HI>Chief</HI> would now no longer pride
him&s;elf on the Character of <HI>Poet</HI> or Performer; nor the <HI>Man</HI>
of <HI>Genius</HI> and <HI>Worth</HI> de&s;cend to the Profe&s;&s;ion 
<PB N="46" REF="45" MS="y"> of <HI>Lyri&s;t, Singer,</HI> or <HI>Actor:</HI>
Becau&s;e the&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions, which had formerly been the Means of
inculcating every thing laudable and great, would now (when perverted to the
contrary Purpo&s;es) be di&s;dained by the Wi&s;e and Vir|tuous.</P>
<P N="36">36. Hence the Power, the Utility and Dignity of
<HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> would &s;ink into a general Corruption and Contempt. This
Con&s;equence is &s;o plain, as to need no Illu&s;tration.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. An Application of the&s;e Principles to the Melody,
Dance, and Song, of ancient <HI>Greece.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SUCH may &s;eem to be the Con&s;equences which would naturally
ari&s;e in a &s;avage, free, and warlike State, &s;hould <HI>Letters</HI> be
introduced and cultivated among &s;uch a &s;pirited and active People. In
Support of the Truth of the&s;e Deductions, let us now endeavour to
<HI>realize</HI> them; by &s;hewing that &s;uch Con&s;equences did in Fact
ari&s;e in ancient GREECE. In the Cour&s;e of this Review, which will con|tain
the Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s, Power, Perfection, Separation, and Corruption, of their
<HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song,</HI> we may per|haps be fortunate enough,

<P N="1">1. "Their Idea of <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> in its mo&s;t inlarged

<HI>&s;avage</HI> State into a certain Degree of <HI>Civilization.</HI> They
needed no <HI>Art</HI> to joyn them: For as they <HI>naturally</HI> produce
each other, and are naturally conjoyned in the &s;avage and uncultivated State,
this Union would of Cour&s;e continue, till &s;ome vio|lent Change in Manners
or Principles &s;hould break that Union which Nature had
e&s;tabli&s;hed.&mdash;It appears no le&s;s evidently from ancient Writers,
that what we call <HI>In&s;tru|mental Mu&s;ic,</HI> that is, the Melody of
In&s;truments, unac|company'd by Dance or Song, was a Thing never held in
E&s;teem till the later Periods of Antiquity, in which a general Separation
took Place. This will appear more at large hereafter. PLATO calls

<P N="2"><PB N="48" REF="47">2. "In the earlie&s;t Periods of the

<P N="4">4. "Mea&s;ured Periods, or, in other Words, Rythm, Numbers,

But as &s;ome particular Con&s;equences ari&s;e from this Foundation, relative

<P N="5">5. "Their earlie&s;t Hi&s;tories were written in Ver&s;e."
This Fact is indi&s;putable; but &s;eems not, as yet, to have been re&s;olved
into its true Cau&s;e. STRABO informs us, that, "The Poetic Form fir&s;t
appeared: They who imi|tated it, dropped the Mea&s;ure: Such were CADMUS the

<P>The Fact, then, is clear and certain: And as it is &s;ome|what
my&s;terious to common Apprehen&s;ion, various Solu|tions have been attempted
by the Learned; though, in my Opinion, without Succe&s;s. I &s;hall give them,
as they ap|pear in various Writers.</P>
<P>LONGINUS hath aimed at &s;omething like a Rea&s;on, in the following
Pa&s;&s;age: 
<Q REND="inline">"Mea&s;ure belongs <HI>naturally</HI> to Poetry, as
its Province is the De&s;cription and <HI>Language</HI> of the
<HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI>; together with <HI>Fiction</HI> or Fable, which
<HI>produce Numbers.</HI> Hence it was that the Ancients (even in their common
Di&s;cour&s;e) u&s;ed Mea&s;ure and Ver&s;e, rather than Pro&s;e<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LONGIN. <HI>de Metr.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> It can hardly
be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the celebrated Critic, in this Pa&s;&s;age,
gives a mere <HI>Affirmation</HI> in&s;tead of an <HI>Argument.</HI> He &s;ays,
indeed, <PB N="52" REF="51"> 
<Q REND="inline">"that the Language of the Pa&s;&s;ions, and Fiction,
natu|rally produce Mea&s;ure and Numbers:"</Q> But the Rea&s;on is &s;till to
&s;eek. It were to be wi&s;hed, that in many Parts of his Writings, he had not
given us more In&s;tances of his fine Ta&s;te, than his Power of
Rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>A learned Modern of our own Nation hath try'd his Talent in this
curious Que&s;tion. 
<Q REND="inline">"They (the Ancients) thought, it would &s;eem, that
Language was the fir&s;t Tamer of Men; and took its Origin to have been
cer|tain rude accidental Sounds, which that naked Company of &s;crambling
Mortals emitted by Chance. Upon this Suppo&s;ition it will follow, that at
fir&s;t they uttered the&s;e Sounds in a <HI>much higher Note</HI> than we do
our Words now; occa&s;ioned, <HI>perhaps,</HI> by their falling on them under
&s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion, Fear, Wonder, or Pain; and then u&s;ing the &s;ame Sound,
either when the Object or Accident re|curred, or when they wanted to de&s;cribe
it by what they felt from its Pre&s;ence. <HI>Neither</HI> the
<HI>Syllables</HI> nor the <HI>Tone</HI> could be <HI>a&s;certained:</HI> but
when prompted by the Return of the Pa&s;&s;ion, under which they invented them,
they <HI>extended</HI> their <HI>Throats</HI> and put &s;everal of the&s;e

(<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">) &s;ignifies to <HI>&s;ing:</HI>
And hence came the ancient Opinion, which ap|pears &s;o <HI>&s;trange</HI> to
<HI>Us,</HI> that Poetry was before Pro&s;e<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Enq. into the Life</HI> of HOMER, p.

which might expo&s;e it to Ridicule, if nei|ther <PB N="53" REF="52">
<HI>Syllables</HI> nor <HI>Tones</HI> could be <HI>a&s;certained,</HI> it
follows, that neither <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI> nor <HI>Melody</HI> could ari&s;e; and
therefore it mu&s;t even continue to appear as &s;trange as ever, 
<Q REND="inline">"that Poetry &s;hould be before Pro&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. DE VOLTAIRE talks more &s;peciou&s;ly (after ARIS|TOTLE and
PLUTARCH<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See the following Articles.</NOTE>) on this
Subject. 
<Q REND="inline">"Before HERODOTUS, even Hi&s;tory was not written
but in Ver&s;e among the GREEKS, who had borrowed this Cu&s;tom from the
ancient EGYPTIANS, the wi&s;e&s;t, the be&s;t po|liced, and the mo&s;t knowing
People upon Earth. This Cu&s;tom was very <HI>rea&s;onable:</HI> for the End of
Hi&s;tory was to pre&s;erve to Po&s;terity the <HI>Memory</HI> of tho&s;e few
great Men, who&s;e Example might be of Service to Mankind. They only writ what
was worthy of being retained by Heart. This is the Rea&s;on why they laid hold
of the Harmony of <HI>Ver&s;e</HI>; that they might aid the <HI>Memory.</HI>
And hence it was, that the fir&s;t <HI>Philo&s;ophers, Legi&s;lators,</HI> and
<HI>Hi&s;torians,</HI> were all <HI>Poets</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Preface &agrave; Oedip.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>As this is the mo&s;t plau&s;ible Rea&s;on that hath as yet been
a&s;&s;igned for this my&s;terious Fact, it will de&s;erve a particular
Con&s;ideration. The Cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned &s;eems, there|fore, to re&s;t on no
probable Foundation, for the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, becau&s;e it &s;eems to take for granted the Exi&s;tence of
the very Thing which it is &s;aid to have produced. If we &s;uppo&s;e Rythm,
Numbers, and Ver&s;e, to exi&s;t and be in general U&s;e, they would
undoubtedly become the natu|ral Means of Memory and Record among a barbarous
Peo|ple. But to <HI>invent</HI> the Vehicle of <HI>Rythm,</HI> from a
<HI>Fore&s;ight</HI> <PB N="54" REF="53"> of its being the be&s;t In&s;trument
of Memory, without any prior Impul&s;e from una&s;&s;i&s;ted Nature, &s;eems
altogether in|compatible with the general Character of the &s;avage Tribes: For
in the Period of &s;avage Manners, the Power of <HI>ab|&s;tract
Rea&s;oning</HI> is always <HI>weak,</HI> and is often found to have <HI>no
Place.</HI></P>
<P>Again: The <HI>Univer&s;ality</HI> of the Fact adds greatly to the
Improbability of the Cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned. Though we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it
po&s;&s;ible or probable, that one &s;avage Chief might by Dint of Rea&s;on
&s;trike out this new method of recording Hi&s;tory; yet that <HI>All</HI>
&s;avage Chiefs, in every known Age and Climate, &s;hould <HI>unite</HI> in the
<HI>&s;ame</HI> Contrivance, is highly improbable. If one of more exalted
Capacity de|livered his Stories in Ver&s;e, <HI>another</HI> of inferior Reach
and Invention would naturally give them to Po&s;terity in plain Pro&s;e: Nay,
the acknowledged Difficulty of <HI>Ver&s;ification</HI> would naturally make
the <HI>pro&s;aic</HI> Manner the more <HI>com|mon,</HI> though le&s;s
effectual Method of the two. Now, the contrary to this is acknowledged to be
true, even by tho&s;e who contend for the Truth and Sufficiency of the Cau&s;e
a&s;&s;igned. The <HI>Univer&s;ality</HI> of the Fact is allowed by All. Such
an univer&s;al Coincidence, therefore, mu&s;t &s;pring from &s;ome other
Cau&s;e, &s;uch as ari&s;eth unalterably from Na|ture, and takes Place among
the &s;avage Tribes in an univer&s;al and unvaried Manner.</P>
<P>Farther: If the ancient Songs, prior to pro&s;e in every Nation, had
been <HI>coolly compo&s;ed,</HI> for the Sake of <HI>Tradition</HI> and
<HI>Information only,</HI> they would have been <HI>circum&s;tantial</HI> and
<HI>preci&s;e:</HI> Whereas the contrary appears in their Con|&s;truction: They
are generally <HI>vague</HI> and <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tic</HI>; and 
<PB N="55" REF="54"> bear all the Marks of being the genuine Effects of
&s;avage <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> So far are they from
containing any regular <HI>Series</HI> of Facts, that Facts are often
<HI>hinted</HI> only; while the mere <HI>Celebration</HI> of the Heroe forms
the chief Weight and <HI>Burthen</HI> of the <HI>Song.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, the univer&s;al Connexion of the <HI>old Poetry</HI> with
<HI>Melody,</HI> and the unvary'd Cu&s;tom of <HI>&s;inging it,</HI> amounts to
the &s;tronge&s;t Proof, that the mere End of <HI>Memory</HI> and
<HI>Tradition</HI> could not be its original Cau&s;e. For had the &s;ole
Intention of the Song been that of <HI>Record only,</HI> a <HI>mere
Recitation</HI> of the Ver&s;es would have an&s;wered the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. And
we may affirm it to be a <HI>moral Impo&s;&s;ibility</HI> that an univer&s;al
Union of Ver&s;e and Melody could have taken Place on this Foundation.</P>
<P>Since, therefore, the Cau&s;e hitherto a&s;&s;igned &s;eems
alto|gether inadequate to the Effect; can we rea&s;onably enter|tain a Doubt,
in re&s;olving it into that Principle which we have already found univer&s;ally
predominant in &s;avage Life? I mean, the natural Pa&s;&s;ion for
<HI>Melody</HI> and <HI>Dance,</HI> which nece&s;&s;arily throws the
accompanying <HI>Song</HI> into a <HI>corre&s;pon|dent Rythm.</HI> Hence, the
U&s;e of Rythm and Ver&s;e mu&s;t naturally ari&s;e in GREECE (as in every
other Country emerging from Barbarity) becau&s;e Melody, Dance, and Song, made
a principal Employment of their &s;avage State. And hence, their earlie&s;t
Hi&s;tories mu&s;t of cour&s;e be writ|ten in Ver&s;e; becau&s;e the Actions of
their Gods and He|roes made a principal Part of their Songs; and therefore,
when the U&s;e of Letters came among them, the&s;e ancient Songs were naturally
<HI>fir&s;t</HI> recorded, that is, they became <PB N="56" REF="55"> their
earlie&s;t <HI>Hi&s;tories,</HI> for the Information and U&s;e of fu|ture
Times.</P>
<P>As this Cau&s;e, when viewed in it&s;elf, &s;eems amply and clearly
to account for the Effect, &s;o it will receive farther Confirmation, if we
con&s;ider how naturally it removes all tho&s;e Objections which load the
Opinion here controvert|ed. For it neither requires nor &s;uppo&s;eth any Power
of <HI>ab&s;tract Rea&s;oning</HI> among the <HI>&s;avage</HI> Tribes, but is
the mere Effect of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> and uncultivated Nature. Its
Uni|ver&s;ality, therefore, becomes highly probable; becau&s;e the Principles
of &s;avage Nature (making Allowance for the Difference of Soil and Climate)
are every where the &s;ame. The <HI>Genius</HI> of the ancient Songs of every
Nation adds new Degrees of Evidence: For they are generally irregular and
enthu&s;ia&s;tic; and therefore the genuine Productions of <HI>unlettered
Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> La&s;tly, their univer&s;al Connexion with
<HI>Melody,</HI> and the unvary'd Practice of <HI>&s;inging</HI> them, comes up
to a full and direct Proof, of the Reality of the Cau&s;e now a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be di&s;gui&s;ed, that the mo&s;t learned VOSSIUS was
&s;o &s;truck with the Difficulty of accounting for this Appearance, that he
thinks it be&s;t to deny the Fact. 
<Q REND="inline">"To me the contrary &s;eems true; that Pro&s;e was

the Writings of MOSES, and the Practice of an|cient EGYPT, this, when properly
explained, will confirm the Truth of the Cau&s;e here given. MOSES, we know,
was learned in all the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Egyptians:</HI> EGYPT was, in his
Time, become a <HI>poli&s;hed Nation</HI>; and therefore, according to the
natural Cour&s;e of Things (as will appear below) <HI>Pro&s;e</HI> had been
introduced before the Time of MOSES, as it was afterwards in GREECE by
HECATAEUS and others. As to the intermixed Songs in the Writ|ings of MOSES, it
is now a Point agreed among the Learned, that they are written in
<HI>Mea&s;ure</HI>; and corre&s;pond in all Re&s;pects with the Principle here
delivered. And that <HI>Song</HI> was the olde&s;t Form of Compo&s;ition in
EGYPT, we learn clearly from two ancient Writers: The Fir&s;t in|forms us, that
their Mu&s;ic and Songs had continued un|changed, for upwards of three
thou&s;and Years<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLATO <HI>de Rep.</HI> l.

and natural Cau&s;e, the pre&s;ent Article will be of ea&s;y Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.
For as the Greek Songs and poetic Stories were fraught with the great Actions
of their Gods and Heroes, &s;o <HI>Maxims</HI> of <HI>Exhortation,</HI> which

<HI>Wrong.</HI></P>
<P>However, as ARISTOTLE hath hinted at another Cau&s;e, the
&s;lighte&s;t Conjecture of &s;o great a Name mu&s;t not pa&s;s unnoticed. He
puts the Que&s;tion thus. 
<Q REND="inline">"Why are many <HI>Songs</HI> called by the name of

that all the Difficulties which load the common Opinion concerning

equally heavy upon <HI>this:</HI> And la&s;tly, that the &s;ame Solution leads
us up to the true Cau&s;e, on the natural Principles of the <HI>&s;avage
Song-Fea&s;t.</HI> This Solution may, perhaps, in the Opinion of &s;ome,
re|ceive additional Confirmation from the concurrent Autho|rity of CASAUBON;
who declares it his Belief (though he a&s;&s;igns no Rea&s;on) that the Songs
called <HI>Nomoi</HI> were <HI>Frag|ments</HI> of ancient Poetry, which had
been &s;elected and pre|served on Account of their Utility<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>In</HI> LAERT.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>

Ver&s;e, and &s;ung by the Prie&s;t or Prie&s;te&s;s of the &s;uppo&s;ed God."
The natural Cau&s;e of this Fact hath been a&s;&s;igned in the Article which
corre&s;ponds with this. The ancients knew <PB N="60" REF="59" MS="y"> and
confe&s;&s;ed the Fact, but were &s;o entirely ignorant of the true Cau&s;e,
that they <HI>laboured</HI> more in this Point, than even in accounting for the
Ri&s;e of <HI>poetic Hi&s;tory</HI> and <HI>Laws.</HI> This will appear from
PLUTARCH, who hath written a Di&s;cour&s;e on the following Que&s;tion, 
<Q REND="inline">"Why the PYTHIA no longer gives her Oracles in
Ver&s;e?"</Q> Now, before he a&s;&s;igned the Cau&s;es why this Practice of
<HI>Oracular Ver&s;e</HI> had <HI>cea&s;ed,</HI> it was natural that he
&s;hould inquire how it fir&s;t <HI>began:</HI> And the Cau&s;es (if &s;uch
they may be called) which he a&s;&s;igns, are the&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, 
<Q REND="inline">"The ancient Times produced a Race of Men, who had
naturally, and from <HI>bodily Temperament,</HI> a &s;tronger Turn for
Poetry."</Q> Secondly, 
<Q REND="inline">"There was a Time, when, in&s;tead of the Art of
Writing, Men u&s;ed Metre, Ver&s;e, or Songs; adapting Hi&s;tory, and other the
weightie&s;t Subjects, to Poetry and Mu&s;ic." "Thus they celebrated the Gods;
and told their Fables in Ver&s;e, &s;ome through the Force of <HI>Genius,</HI>
and others by the Power of <HI>Cu&s;tom.</HI>" "Therefore the God permitted the
Application of Ver&s;e and Song to his Oracles, and would not drive the Mu&s;es

<Q REND="inline">"The Utility of Poetry is in nothing more

<P>Thus the learned PLUTARCH; who&s;e weak Rea&s;onings (weak becau&s;e
he wanted Facts to lead him to the Truth) <PB N="61" REF="60"> hardly need a
Confutation. For how came it &s;o to pa&s;s, that the fir&s;t Race of Men were

with|out any Mixture of <HI>artificial Compo&s;ition.</HI>" Much hath been
&s;aid on this Subject, in &s;upport of the contrary Opi|nion; and with a View
of proving, that the ancient Melody which wrought &s;uch Wonders in GREECE, was
learned, artificial, and complex. With others, an Author no le&s;s
con&s;iderable than Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE hath concurred in that Opinion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>On Poetry,</HI> &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>: And all the
Writers on this Subject &s;eem to have given us a Parade of Words without any
determinate Ideas annexed to them. I &s;hall therefore, fir&s;t, a&s;&s;ign the
Rea&s;ons why it appears to me, that we have no adequate Idea of the ancient
GREEK Melody; and then, &s;hall collect certain collateral Circum|&s;tances,
which may prove, that although we are ignorant of its particular Nature, yet
that it was of a <HI>&s;imple</HI> and <HI>in|artificial</HI>
Con&s;truction.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, with Re&s;pect to the three <HI>Genera</HI> or
<HI>Kinds</HI> of the <HI>Greek Melody</HI>; as they are delivered and
interpreted by the Writers on ancient Mu&s;ic, they are incompatible with all
tho&s;e Intervals and Progre&s;&s;ions of Sound which are agree|able to the
human Ear.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Enharmonic</HI> Kind, it is confe&s;&s;edly
imprac|ticable. For it is &s;aid to have proceeded by two <HI>Die&s;es</HI> or 
<PB N="63" REF="62"> <HI>Quarter-Notes</HI>; (with a &s;tated intermixture of
two whole Tones) an Interval which no human Ear can preci&s;ely
di&s;|tingui&s;h, nor any human Voice preci&s;ely follow. This Fact is &s;o
notorious, and &s;trikes &s;o &s;trongly on the Sen&s;es, that the Bigots to
the ancient Melody have generally been &s;ilent on it, or at mo&s;t, have
revered it as a profound My|stery. The ABBE DU BOS may be regarded as an
Ex|ception to this general Remark: For He is of Opinion, that the
Progre&s;&s;ion of the Voice by <HI>Quarter-Notes</HI> might be in general
U&s;e in the theatrical Declamation<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Reflex.
Crit. Part.</HI> iii. c. ix.</BIBL></NOTE>. To this it may be &s;ufficient to
reply, that the ABBE confe&s;&s;eth him&s;elf ignorant of the Principles of
Mu&s;ic<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>, and that this
Opinion is a Proof of his being &s;o. The Quarter-Note is a Progre&s;&s;ion
which, although an <HI>Italian</HI> CAS|TRATO (who hath laboured at this
Refinement through his whole Life) may <HI>nearly</HI> and
<HI>incidentally</HI> accompli&s;h; yet even <HI>He</HI> &s;hall never be able
<HI>&s;trictly</HI> to practi&s;e in the <HI>general Cour&s;e</HI> of his
Performance: But it is a Progre&s;&s;ion, equally impracticable to the Voice,
and &s;hocking to the Ear of the Generality of Mankind.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chromatic</HI> &s;eems, at fir&s;t View, to be more
intelligi|ble; as it is generally &s;aid to have proceeded by
<HI>Half-Notes,</HI> of which the human Ear hath an adequate and pre|ci&s;e
Conception. But This too, on a nearer Examination, will be found absolutely at
Variance with that which We &s;tile the <HI>Chromatic</HI>; (though by mo&s;t
modern Writers it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame) and altogether
in|compatible with tho&s;e Progre&s;&s;ions of Sound into which a modern Voice
can fall. For the modern <HI>Chromatic</HI> Kind <PB N="62" REF="63">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="63" REF="64">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="64" REF="65"> is an
<HI>incidental</HI> A&s;cent or De&s;cent by Half-Notes, with a variable
Intervention of whole Notes, introduced, under certain Re&s;trictions, at the
Compo&s;er's Will: But the an|cient <HI>Chromatic,</HI> as delivered by the
Writers on this Sub|ject, was an <HI>unvaried</HI> Progre&s;&s;ion, by two
<HI>Half-Notes,</HI> and a <HI>Third</HI> either <HI>greater</HI> or
<HI>le&s;s</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See ALYPIUS; at the End of the
<HI>Phaenomena</HI> of ARATUS: To whom I refer for the Truth of the&s;e Remarks
on the three <HI>Genera.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Diatonic</HI> Kind, according to the common Concep|tion of
it, is perfectly under&s;tood; and is generally &s;aid to be the &s;ame with
that, in which our modern Mu&s;ic is com|monly compo&s;ed: Yet nothing is
le&s;s true than this: For our common Scale is a Progre&s;&s;ion of whole
Notes, with the Intermixture of two half Notes only, and the&s;e at the
Di&s;tance of a <HI>fifth</HI> from each other in the <HI>&s;harp</HI> Key, and
a <HI>fourth</HI> from each other in the <HI>flat</HI> Key: Whereas in the
ancient Diatonic Scale it is quite otherwi&s;e: For There, Here, <HI>one
Semitone</HI> and <HI>two whole Tones</HI> are ordained to &s;ucceed each other
<HI>invariably:</HI> A Circum&s;tance utterly incompatible with the modern
<HI>Diatonic</HI> Scale.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence drawn from the&s;e Rea&s;onings, is not, that the
Ancients talked or practi&s;ed ab&s;urdly; or that the Moderns want Ears or
Under&s;tanding; but only This, that we do not adequately under&s;tand the
Terms.</P>
<P>What leads me farther to believe this, is a Circum&s;tance in the
<HI>Spartan</HI> Decree again&s;t TIMOTHEUS (given at large below) where it is
&s;aid, that he corrupted the <HI>Simplicity</HI> of the <HI>Enharmonic,</HI>
and introduced the <HI>Refinements</HI> of the <HI>Chromatic.</HI> Now this is
an ab&s;olute Contradiction to All that we under&s;tand concerning the Nature
of the&s;e two Kinds. For, as the <HI>Diatonic,</HI> which proceeds by whole 
<PB N="65" REF="66"> Tones, is more &s;imple than the <HI>Chromatic,</HI> which
proceeds by <HI>Half-Tones</HI>; &s;o This, in its Turn, is more &s;imple than
the <HI>Enharmonic,</HI> which is &s;aid to have proceeded by
<HI>Quar|ter-Tones:</HI> All which is in direct Contradiction to the Tenor of
the <HI>Spartan</HI> Decree.</P>
<P>Secondly, with Regard to the various <HI>Modes</HI> of ancient
Melody, we are often as much in the dark. We read of no le&s;s than fifteen,
introduced at different Periods; but the Commentators on the ancient Writers
upon this Sub|ject, are at Variance with each other, concerning the Na|ture and
U&s;e of the&s;e different Modes. Some are of Opi|nion, that the Difference lay
in the Degree of <HI>Gravity</HI> or <HI>Acutene&s;s</HI> only: Others
maintain, that the Mode &s;ignified the <HI>Rythm,</HI> or <HI>Mea&s;ure:</HI>
Others again, that the E&s;&s;ence of the <HI>Mode</HI> con&s;i&s;ted in a
<HI>different Species</HI> of <HI>Diapa&s;on.</HI> There is Rea&s;on to
believe, that the Word was u&s;ed at va|rious Times, and by different Writers,
in all the&s;e Sen&s;es, and that each of the&s;e Authors may be right in his
Turn. From the De&s;cription of an In&s;trument given by ATHE|NAEUS it appears,
that by <HI>Mode</HI> was &s;ometimes meant <HI>Gravity</HI> or
<HI>Acutene&s;s</HI> of Sound: For he tells us, that the Mu&s;ician had three
Lyres placed on a moveable Tripod which turned on an Axis; and that by whirling
it round with his Foot, he could in&s;tantly play in three various Modes<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>L. xiv.</BIBL></NOTE>. That <HI>Mode</HI> was &s;ometimes
u&s;ed for <HI>Mea&s;ure,</HI> &s;eems evident, becau&s;e in a Fragment of an
ancient Author cited by ATHENAEUS, we read that a <HI>Hymn</HI> was writ|ten in
the <HI>Lydian Mode</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>;
which can only mean, the <HI>Phrygian</HI> or <HI>Dorian Mea&s;ure.</HI> And as
<HI>Mode</HI> was ap|plied to Numbers, &s;o was it likewi&s;e to
<HI>Dance:</HI> The <HI>Ionici Motus,</HI> which ancient Writers &s;peak of,
are a clear <PB N="66" REF="67"> Proof of This. That <HI>Mode</HI> was u&s;ed
in the third of the&s;e Acceptations, as a particular <HI>Species</HI> of
<HI>Diapa&s;on,</HI> hath been made clear by a late Writer, in a judicious and
accurate Treati&s;e<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>By Sir FR. EYLES
STILES.</BIBL></NOTE>. Thus by the promi&s;cuous U&s;e of the Word Mode,
&s;ignifying either <HI>Pitch, Mea&s;ure,</HI> or <HI>Species</HI> of
<HI>Diapa&s;on,</HI> it hath come to pa&s;s, that &s;ome times the
Signi|fication of the Word is <HI>clear,</HI> at others it is only
<HI>probable,</HI> often it is <HI>ob&s;cure</HI> and <HI>doubtful.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, to complete our Ignorance of the particular Nature of their
Melody, the Con&s;truction of their Mu&s;ical In&s;truments is unknown. We only
know, that the Chords of the Lyre were augmented gradually from <HI>four</HI>
to <HI>forty:</HI> but whether the Strings a&s;cended by Quarter-Notes,
Half-Notes, whole Notes, or by larger Intervals, of all this we know nothing
certain. Our Ignorance of their Pipes or Flutes is not le&s;s remarkable.
Commentators and Critics ring Changes on their &s;ingle, double, oblique,
right-handed, and left-handed Flutes; but what was their preci&s;e Make, Tone,
Compa&s;s, or Powers, the&s;e Gentlemen cannot, with any Certainty, inform us.
The learned ISAAC VOSSIUS is one of the warme&s;t Champions for the Excellence
of an|cient In&s;truments: but whoever reads him without Parti|ality, will find
all his Endeavours amount to no more than what is here affirmed<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Poem. Cantu,</HI> &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Since, therefore, the particular Nature and Con&s;truction of the
ancient Melody is utterly unknown to us; we mu&s;t have Recour&s;e to
collateral Proofs, drawn from Facts which were connected with this unknown
Melody; and from The&s;e we may, I think, indirectly arrive &s;o far at a
Know|ledge of its <HI>general</HI> Character, as to conclude with Cen|tainty, 
<PB N="67" REF="68"> that in the <HI>early</HI> Periods (in which
<HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> boa&s;ted its <HI>greate&s;t Power)</HI> the ruling Character
of the <HI>Melody</HI> was that of <HI>Simplicity</HI>; and that it derived a
chief Part of its <HI>Force</HI> from its mere <HI>Rythm</HI> or
<HI>Mea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>Simplicity was its ruling Character; becau&s;e we find that
<HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> had <HI>then</HI> its greate&s;t Power, when the
<HI>Melody</HI> was mo&s;t <HI>confined</HI> in its <HI>Compa&s;s.</HI> MERCURY
was the In|ventor of the <HI>Lyre</HI>; which had but <HI>four</HI> Strings,
and the&s;e were &s;tretched on a Turtle's Shell<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PAUSANIAS, l. ix.</BIBL></NOTE>. AM|PHION was his
Di&s;ciple, and increa&s;ed the Number of Strings to <HI>&s;even</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>, APOLLO contented him&s;elf with
the &s;ame Compa&s;s of Notes; and &s;o did ORPHEUS<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. This Number of Strings continued to be
e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law at SPARTA, &s;o late as the Age of TIMOTHEUS, who
attempted an Innovation of <HI>four</HI> more, and was puni&s;hed for it<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See the <HI>Spartan</HI> Decree again&s;t TIMOTHEUS, given
at large below.</BIBL></NOTE>. Yet all the mighty Effects and Powers of
<HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> which we read of in ancient GREECE, aro&s;e within this
Period, and while the <HI>Melody</HI> was confined within this &s;mall
Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>The Lyre, therefore, in its mo&s;t ancient Forms, being in|capable
either of a great Variety, or a multifarious Com|bination of Sounds; a &s;trong
Probability ari&s;eth from its very Nature, that <HI>Counterpoint,</HI> or an
artificial Compo&s;ition in <HI>various Parts,</HI> was altogether unknown. It
appears to me (from many Pa&s;&s;ages of ancient Authors compared together, but
too long to in&s;ert here) that the Ancients &s;ung and played fir&s;t in
Uni&s;ons, Octaves, and Fifteenths; then in Thirds and Tenths; and in the later
Periods in Fourths and Fifths, as appears from PLUTARCH; though in ARISTOTLE's

this only in the Way of <HI>Divi&s;ion</HI> upon the <HI>fun|damental

<HI>dividing</HI> the &s;ame Melody, I find nothing like Compo|&s;ition in
<HI>various Parts.</HI></P>
<P>Oh the contrary, there are many Rea&s;ons which may convince us,
that nothing like the modern <HI>Counterpoint</HI> was known to the Ancients.
The Silence of all their Mu&s;ical Writers collected by MEIBOMIUS, on this
great Article, is a Proof &s;ufficient that they were ignorant of it. Their
Divi&s;ions of the mu&s;ical Art are preci&s;e and &s;y&s;tema|tical; and
therefore, if this had made a Part of it, as its Rules mu&s;t have been more
complex than tho&s;e of any other Branch, beyond all Doubt, they would have
been di&s;tinctly treated of.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Con&s;equence &s;eems clearly to ari&s;e from a
Pa&s;&s;age in ARISTOTLE, who &s;ays, that 
<Q REND="inline">"it is much ea&s;ier to keep the <HI>Time</HI> in
Mu&s;ic, when a Number &s;ing toge|ther, than when a &s;ingle Voice only

of an|other; but in direct Contradiction to the Truth, if we &s;uppo&s;e them
to &s;ing in Counterpoint; becau&s;e, here, the various Parts have a Tendency
to confound each other.</P>
<P>Their Ignorance of Counterpoint appears farther from hence, that no
Difference is remarked between the Com|po&s;itions for the <HI>Flute</HI> and
tho&s;e for the <HI>Lyre,</HI> with Re&s;pect to the <HI>Multiplicity</HI> of
<HI>Parts.</HI> One In&s;trument they u&s;ed, which had two Strings to every
Note, and the&s;e two were tuned in <HI>thirds</HI> to each other: This
In&s;trument was called <PB N="69" REF="72"> the <HI>Magadis</HI>; and even
this di&s;tant Approach towards playing in Counterpoint was regarded as a Thing
&s;o &s;in|gular, that to play in <HI>thirds</HI> was called
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. If there|fore any other Kind of
Performance had been u&s;ed more complex than this, it mu&s;t have been noted
as a Circum|&s;tance &s;till more &s;ingular.</P>
<P>It appears farther, that in HOMER's Hymn to MER|CURY, the Poet
repre&s;ents APOLLO as holding his Lyre in one Hand, and playing with a
<HI>Plectrum</HI> with the other. In an ancient Sculpture which repre&s;ents
the Deification of HOMER, &s;ome of the Figures which dance, are at the &s;ame
Time playing on the Lyre, which they hold with one Hand, and &s;trike with the
other. Thus too, when SOPHOCLES played on the Lyre, and at the &s;ame Time led
the Dance<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Deipno&s;oph.</HI> l.
i.</BIBL></NOTE>, he mu&s;t have managed his In&s;trument in the &s;ame Manner.
And again, it appears, that even in the latter Periods, the mo&s;t celebrated
Lyri&s;ts played with <HI>one Plectrum</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.
l. xiv.</BIBL> They &s;ometimes touched the String with a <HI>Plectrum,</HI>
&s;ometimes with the <HI>Finger.</HI> But that the Cu&s;tom of playing with the

H. STEPHENS, from PLUTARCH, 
<Q REND="inline">"that <HI>Spartans</HI> puni&s;hed a Lyri&s;t for

<HI>Finger</HI> would come into U&s;e. This (as will appear be|low, Art. 33.)
explains the Foundation of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Conduct.</NOTE>. Now, all
the&s;e Circum&s;tances center in the Proof of this, that the Melody which they
played was <HI>&s;ingle.</HI></P>
<P>We may farther ob&s;erve, that their mu&s;ical <HI>Notation</HI>
(&s;o far as it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be under&s;tood) generally implies a 
<PB N="70" REF="73"> &s;ingle, and that a very inartificial Species of
Compo&s;ition. Nay, the Letters which compo&s;ed their mu&s;ical Notation
&s;eem very inadequately to expre&s;s even a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> Part, did not
the <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI> of the <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> in &s;ome Degree fix that of the
<HI>Melody.</HI></P>
<P>Add to all the&s;e Arguments this farther Confirmation, that their
Poets (who were generally at the &s;ame Time Warriours, Prie&s;ts, or
State&s;men) not only compo&s;ed the Melody to their own Ver&s;es, but, in the
early Periods, played and &s;ung them at their Fe&s;tivals: And that People of
all Ages and Degrees were commonly able to bear a Part in the Chorus, both in
public and private Entertainments. All the&s;e concurrent Circum&s;tances
center in one &s;ufficient and &s;atisfactory Proof, that their Melody was not
only <HI>&s;ingle,</HI> but of the mo&s;t <HI>&s;imple Con&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P>One Kind of <HI>Addition</HI> did undoubtedly in many In&s;tances
take Place: I mean that of the <HI>Tympanum,</HI> the <HI>Si&s;trum,</HI> or
the <HI>Cymbal</HI> added as an unvaried <HI>Groundwork,</HI> and accom|modated
to the Mea&s;ure of the <HI>ruling Melody:</HI> But this was no more than the
modern <HI>Drum</HI> added to the <HI>Fife</HI> or <HI>Trumpet,</HI> the
<HI>Tabor</HI> to the <HI>Pipe,</HI> or the <HI>Drone</HI> to the
<HI>Bag|pipe:</HI> A Kind of Addition which we find in the Mu&s;ic of almo&s;t
every barbarous Country.</P>
<P>Since therefore it appears, that the Force of the ancient
<HI>Greek</HI> Melody con&s;i&s;ted neither in its <HI>Compa&s;s,</HI> its
<HI>Multi|&s;olicity</HI> of <HI>Parts,</HI> nor its <HI>artificial</HI>
Con&s;truction; let us now proceed to con&s;ider the only Circum&s;tance from
which its chief Power could ari&s;e, I mean, its <HI>Rythm</HI> or
<HI>Mea&s;ure.</HI> That this was its real Source, may be evident from the
following Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The <HI>Greek</HI> Language was admirably fitted for a
various and powerful <HI>Rythm</HI> or <HI>Mea&s;ure,</HI> by its Variety of 
<PB N="71" REF="74"> <HI>Feet</HI>; which, when thrown into all their different
Combi|nations, formed &s;uch a Variety of <HI>Numbers,</HI> as gave Room for an
equal and corre&s;pondent Variety of <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI> in the annexed
<HI>Melody,</HI> beyond any other Language in the known World. When, therefore,
&s;uch a Language offered it&s;elf as an A&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Mu&s;ician's
Art, it was altogether natu|ral that he &s;hould accommodate his Melody to the
peculiar and happy Genius of his Native Tongue.</P>
<P>Secondly, &s;uch a Melody as this, marked by &s;trong Changes and
Varieties of Mea&s;ure, mu&s;t have greater Ef|fects than the mo&s;t
exten&s;ive or mo&s;t artificial Melody when una&s;&s;i&s;ted by it. This
argument is well pur&s;ued by the learned ISAAC VOSSIUS: I &s;hall therefore
give it in his own Words; the rather, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t judicious and
philo&s;ophic Pa&s;&s;age in his whole Work; and contains as it were the
<HI>Kernel</HI> of a large Tract; a con&s;iderable Part of which, it mu&s;t be
owned, may ju&s;tly be thrown a&s;ide as <HI>Hu&s;k</HI> and
<HI>Shell.</HI></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Wherefore, I cannot enough wonder at tho&s;e who in
the pre&s;ent and pa&s;t Age have written on Mu&s;ic; that while they
diligently explained other Things, they &s;hould either have &s;aid nothing on
<HI>Rythm,</HI> or el&s;e written in &s;uch a Manner, as to prove them&s;elves
ignorant of its Nature. They confine them&s;elves entirely to
<HI>Counter-point,</HI> neglecting that which is principal in Melody.&mdash;For certainly, as neither an <HI>Unit</HI> can produce <HI>Number,</HI> nor a
<HI>&s;ingle Word</HI> make <HI>Sen&s;e</HI>; &s;o neither can any <HI>&s;ingle
Sound,</HI> &s;eparately con&s;idered, have any <HI>Power:</HI> Or if it hath,
it mu&s;t be very incon&s;iderable. For what Effect in moving the Pa&s;&s;ions
can ari&s;e from the Colli&s;ion of Stones or Wood, or even from the &s;triking
of one String, <PB N="72" REF="75"> if <HI>Numbers</HI> and <HI>Rythm</HI> be
wanting, and we hear nothing but a mere Sound<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The
learned Writer is mi&s;taken in this Paragraph. The mere Sound of
<HI>Thunder</HI> excites <HI>Fear</HI>; other Sounds excite <HI>Sorrow</HI>;
others <HI>Joy.</HI> See the next Article.</NOTE>? Or if we compound various
Sounds, and the&s;e be even harmonic and concordant, not even This will produce
any Effect. Such an Harmony of Sounds may plea&s;e the Ear; but the Plea&s;ure
will only be &s;uch, as if Words were (agreeably) &s;poken, which are either
unmeaning or not under&s;tood. That the Soul may be affected, it is
nece&s;&s;ary that the Sound &s;hould imply, or bring before us, &s;omething
which we can comprehend. That Sounds, therefore, may have their full Effect,
the Melody mu&s;t be animated by &s;uch Move|ments, as contain in them&s;elves
the <HI>Repre&s;entations</HI> or <HI>Images</HI> of tho&s;e Things which we
mean to <HI>expre&s;s</HI> or <HI>imitate</HI> by Song: And This if we can do,
we may be &s;ure to command the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Soul. But that we may
indeed catch and call forth the&s;e <HI>Images,</HI> we mu&s;t employ that
Variety of Mu&s;ical <HI>Feet,</HI> in which are &s;o fully contained all the
&s;everal Kinds of Movements, that no Affection can be conceived, which they do
not mo&s;t exactly expre&s;s. For the Expre&s;&s;ion of light and voluble
Motions, as of the Dances of <HI>Satyrs,</HI> the <HI>Pyrrichius</HI> and
<HI>Tribrachys</HI> are proper: The <HI>grave</HI> and <HI>&s;low</HI> are
expre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Spondee</HI> and <HI>Molo&s;&s;us:</HI> Whatever is
<HI>&s;oft</HI> and <HI>tender,</HI> the <HI>Trochee,</HI> and &s;ometimes the
<HI>Amphibrachys</HI> will de|&s;cribe, which it&s;elf moves with a broken and
effeminate Pace. The <HI>Iambic</HI> is fierce and <HI>vehement</HI>; and the
<HI>Anapae&s;t</HI> nearly of the &s;ame Nature, as it imitates violent and
warlike Motions. If we mean to expre&s;s what is <HI>chearful</HI> and
<HI>joyous,</HI> we mu&s;t employ the <HI>Dactyl,</HI> who&s;e 
<PB N="73" REF="76"> Movements are of a corre&s;pondent Nature. Whatever is
<HI>hard</HI> and <HI>rugged,</HI> the <HI>Anti&s;pa&s;t</HI> will happily
de&s;cribe. If we require Numbers that may expre&s;s <HI>Fury</HI> and
<HI>Mad|ne&s;s,</HI> not only the <HI>Anapae&s;t</HI> is at Hand, but, what is
&s;till more powerful, the <HI>Paeon quartus.</HI>&mdash;Of the&s;e various
Mea&s;ures, artificially combined, did the ancient <HI>Greek</HI> and
<HI>Roman</HI> Mu&s;ic con&s;i&s;t: And while this flouri&s;hed, &s;o long did
Mu&s;ic maintain its Empire over the Pa&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>VOSSIUS <HI>de Poem. Cantu et Viribus Rythmi,</HI> p.
72.</BIBL></NOTE>".</Q> Thus the learned VOSSIUS: Who&s;e Admiration of the
Rythm of the ancient Melody leads him into &s;ome fal&s;e Conclu&s;ions, as
will appear below. In the mean Time, this general Exhibition of the Genius of
the Greek <HI>Numbers</HI> may &s;tand as a farther accumulative Proof, that
the Power of the ancient <HI>Melody,</HI> which was univer&s;ally accommo|dated
to this <HI>Variety</HI> of <HI>expre&s;&s;ive Numbers,</HI> lay chiefly in its
<HI>Rythm</HI> or <HI>Mea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, the&s;e Arguments are much confirmed by the ex|pre&s;s
Te&s;timony of PLUTARCH; who, &s;peaking of the Variations which the Genius of
ancient Mu&s;ic had under|gone in the Progre&s;s of Time, &s;ays, 
<Q REND="inline">"If we compare An|tiquity with the pre&s;ent Times,
we &s;hall find, that in ancient Days, there was a great Variety

<HI>We</HI> now &s;tudy and attend to Variety of <HI>Modes,</HI> the

he regards as one of the Corruptions of Melody; he gives an Account of the
Inventors of the &s;everal <HI>new Modes,</HI> MELANIPPIDES, PHILOXENUS,
TIMOTHEUS, and others; and in&s;i&s;ts, that the Art, which formerly had &s;uch

mere Amu&s;e|ment of the Theatre<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De
Mu&s;ica.</BIBL></NOTE>. A clear and full Indication, that the ancient
<HI>Greeks</HI> relied on <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI> or <HI>Rythm</HI> for the
<HI>Force</HI> of their <HI>Melody</HI>; and that as it grew <HI>more
arti|ficial,</HI> it grew <HI>le&s;s powerful.</HI> The&s;e Facts fully
coincide with the Rea&s;ons given above, on which this Article is founded; 
<Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e a Simplicity of Melody, who&s;e Power
aro&s;e from mere Rythm or Mea&s;ure, was mo&s;t &s;uited to the Powers of the
fir&s;t barbarous Legi&s;lators or Bards, as well as to the Capacity of the
&s;urrounding People."</Q></P>
<P N="10">10. "The Force of this &s;imple Melody was much in|crea&s;ed
by the Power of <HI>early A&s;&s;ociation</HI> and <HI>continued Habit.</HI>
For This, by appropriating certain Sounds to certain Subjects, rai&s;ed their
Melody into a Kind of natural and expre&s;&s;ive Language of the
Pa&s;&s;ions."&mdash;In the fir&s;t rude E&s;&s;ays towards an expre&s;&s;ive
Melody in bar|barous Countries, certain imperfect Modes of Sound mu&s;t of
Cour&s;e be applied, as being expre&s;&s;ive of certain Subjects, or
Pa&s;&s;ions. The &s;ucceeding Generation will be naturally bred up to a like
Application of the &s;ame Sounds. Hence the&s;e Modes of Melody, though
<HI>imperfect</HI> in Expre&s;&s;ion, being impre&s;&s;ed on <HI>infant
Minds</HI> with all the Force of an early Application, mu&s;t acquire a Power
over <HI>The&s;e,</HI> which unaccu&s;tomed Minds can never feel. Thus certain
Sounds being appropriated by U&s;e, and having become the com|mon Indications
of Grief, Terror, Joy, Pity, Rage, or any other Pa&s;&s;ion, will naturally
excite their re&s;pective Affections among tho&s;e who have adopted them; while
a Hearer from another Country, who&s;e A&s;&s;ociations and Habits are
different, will be <HI>little,</HI> or, if at all, perhaps very 
<PB N="75" REF="78"> <HI>differently</HI> affected by them. LAFITAU's Account
of the Mu&s;ic of the <HI>Iroquois</HI> is a clear Confirmation of this Truth: 
<Q REND="inline">"The Mu&s;ic and Dance of the Americans have
&s;omething in them extremely <HI>barbarous,</HI> which at fir&s;t
<HI>di&s;gu&s;ts:</HI> We grow <HI>reconciled</HI> to them <HI>by Degrees,</HI>
and in the <HI>End</HI> partake of them with <HI>Plea&s;ure.</HI> As to the
Savages them&s;elves, they are <HI>fond</HI> of them even to
<HI>Di&s;traction</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect.
ii.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> What we are told of the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Song gives
additional Con|firmation to this Principle. This Song, which to foreign Ears is
uncouth and barbarous, hath &s;uch an Effect on the Natives of SWITZERLAND,
among whom it is generally taught and impre&s;&s;ed on the infant Mind, that it
is forbid to be &s;ung among their Regiments hired in the Service of other
Nations, le&s;t it &s;hould tempt them to de&s;ert, and re|turn to their own
Country. The <HI>Jews, Chine&s;e, Germans, French, Italians,</HI> have all
&s;ome peculiar Appropriations of a &s;imilar Nature, which gives their native
Mu&s;ic a general Power, which no other Mu&s;ic can ever obtain. Among
our&s;elves, the Sound of <HI>Bells, Drums, Organs, Trumpets,</HI> have all an
Appropriation of the &s;ame Nature: And a Highlander has the &s;ame
<HI>warlike</HI> Ideas annexed to the Sound of a <HI>Bagpipe</HI> (an
In&s;trument which an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> derides) as the
<HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> has to that of a <HI>Trumpet</HI> or a <HI>Fife.</HI>
MELODY therefore is to be con&s;idered as a <HI>relative</HI> thing, founded in
the particular A&s;&s;ociations and Habits of each People; and by Cu&s;tom
(like Language) annexed to their Sentiments and Pa&s;&s;ions: Thus it becomes
the natural Vehicle of the&s;e Sentiments and Pa&s;&s;ions; but a Vehicle,
which can never extend farther than to Tho&s;e, upon whom &s;uch particular
Impre&s;&s;ions have been made. This, added to the Power of <HI>Rythm,</HI>
affords a natural Solution to the <PB N="76" REF="79"> Difficulties rai&s;ed
concerning the Power of the <HI>Greek</HI> Melody: For as it was taught and
impre&s;&s;ed on the infant Mind by early and continued Application (as will
imme|diately appear) &s;o it naturally acquired the Power of a
<HI>Language</HI> of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> which with Re&s;pect to other
Nations, if it now exi&s;ted, it would not po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>There is a collateral Argument often urged in Favour of the
artificial Excellence of the ancient <HI>Greek Melody</HI>; and drawn from what
we know of the Elegance and Perfection of ancient <HI>Greek Sculpture.</HI> But
the Weakne&s;s of this Argument will appear from the Principles here given; the
Effects of the two Arts being by no means <HI>parallel,</HI> but rather
contrary to each other. The <HI>Excellence</HI> of <HI>Sculp|ture</HI> is the
Effect of repeated Experience, which refers it&s;elf to the Works of Nature, as
to its Archetype: And the Plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the Contemplation of this
Art con&s;i&s;ts in &s;eeing the Perfection of the Imitation; and is the
Re&s;ult of a fine Ta&s;te, founded on a correct Judgment. But the
<HI>Force</HI> of <HI>Melody</HI> on the Pa&s;&s;ions depends not on its
artificial Con&s;truction or Elegance, but &s;olely on its being adapted to the
Feelings, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Conceptions of the Hearer, be they ju&s;t or
fal&s;e, poli&s;hed or barbarous. Hence we &s;hall find, that the
<HI>Force</HI> of the two Arts will be generally in an <HI>inver&s;e
Proportion.</HI> For the <HI>Attention</HI> to <HI>Sculpture,</HI> being
founded on a <HI>reflex Act</HI> of the Under|&s;tanding, will always
increa&s;e with increa&s;ing Ta&s;te and Knowledge: But the <HI>Power</HI> of
<HI>Melody,</HI> being founded in <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> will <HI>there</HI> be
mo&s;t general and &s;trong, where Fear, Joy, Wonder, Terror, and
A&s;toni&s;hment, are mo&s;t ea&s;ily and mo&s;t frequently excited: And it is
certain, the&s;e natu|ral Pa&s;&s;ions are not &s;o common in a State highly
poli&s;hed, as in that of Barbarity or &s;imple Civilization. 'Tis granted 
<PB N="77" REF="80"> indeed, nay in&s;i&s;ted on, that the ancient Melody grew
more artificial in the later Periods: But the &s;ame Authors who inform us of

continued longe&s;t in Barbarity, I mean the Commonwealth of SPARTA; and that
as it grew more artificial, it degenerated every where into a mere Amu&s;ement,
and lo&s;t its Influence on the Pa&s;&s;ions and the Mind.</P>

find their Songs com|po&s;ed in the &s;ame <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> Style and

<P>HESIOD &s;eems to &s;tand at the Head of the&s;e, in the Order of
Time. And his <HI>Theogony</HI> is a living Witne&s;s how far HIS
<HI>legi&s;lative</HI> Turn accords to the Principles here deliver|ed. He
gives, in Form, the <HI>Generation</HI> of all the <HI>Gods</HI> of GREECE; and
mixeth his Narration with their <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Prai&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>HOMER appears next in the Order of Time: And in his unrivaled Songs
we find the <HI>Religion, Polities,</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> of ancient GREECE
di&s;played with all the Ap|pearances of Truth, becau&s;e delivered with all
their <HI>Imper|fections.</HI> During the early Periods of Civilization, the 
<PB N="79" REF="82"> <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> Art is always of an
<HI>imperfect</HI> Form. In the rude Progre&s;s of barbarous Manners, the
<HI>moral</HI> Ideas are <HI>confined,</HI> and little di&s;tingui&s;hed. If
the People be fierce and war|like (as were the Tribes of GREECE) Strength,
Courage, Agility, and Cunning, are the ruling Virtues. Hence it follows, that
the Pictures both of <HI>Gods</HI> and <HI>Men</HI> will ac|cord to this
Principle in &s;uch a Period: And hence many of the Fables of HOMER him&s;elf
were of a Ca&s;t &s;o different from the Spirit of <HI>improved
Legi&s;lation,</HI> that PLATO re|fu&s;ed them Admittance into his
Republic<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Rep.</HI> l. ii,

bani&s;hing Poetry, without Exception, from his perfect Republic. So far is
this from being true, that he affirms directly, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he only means to bani&s;h That which is

Part of <HI>Mu&s;ic.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>And here, while we acknowledge HOMER as the &s;upreme Painter of
natural Manners, and of a Genius truly <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> according to the
Principles of his Time; critical Ju&s;tice de|mands, that we take off &s;ome of
tho&s;e fal&s;e Colourings of Prai&s;e, which both Ancients and Moderns have
lavi&s;hed on him, in Regard to the Excellence of the <HI>Morals</HI> which he
taught. HORACE, it is well known, hath &s;et him above the old Philo&s;ophers,
as a Teacher of all Virtue<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Qui quid pulchrum,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></NOTE>.
PLUTARCH, in his Life of HOMER, hath advanced the &s;ame Po&s;itions: But
whoever will examine his Poems with an impartial Eye, will find a very
deficient Plan of Morals prevailing through them. There is not the lea&s;t
Ve&s;tige or Appearance of tho&s;e ab&s;tract general Principles of moral
Excellence or Blame, which take Place in the more refined <PB N="80" REF="83">
Periods of &s;ocial and poli&s;hed Life: His Gods and Heroes fight and plunder,

or from a <HI>refined legi&s;lative Art</HI> without.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that PLUTARCH, after labouring in vain through many

HOMER, is forced at length to conclude; 
<Q REND="inline">"It is true, indeed, that <HI>bad</HI> Actions and

<P>The Incon&s;i&s;tency of a late learned Writer on this Sub|ject is
too glaring to pa&s;s unnoticed. He ju&s;tly critici&s;eth VIRGIL, as being
&s;hackled by the refined Manners of his Times, and the political Forms of his

<P>The next great <HI>legi&s;lative Bard</HI> whom I &s;hall now
men|tion, was PINDAR. At the Period when He flouri&s;hed, the Fortune and Glory
of GREECE were ri&s;ing to their Meridian: The <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> Arts had
now obtained a higher Degree of <HI>Perfection:</HI> And accordingly we find,
in his &s;ublime <HI>Songs,</HI> the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t perfect Union of
&s;alutary Principles, thrown out in Maxims religious, political, and moral. No
Vices or Imperfections, either of Gods or Men, are there applauded or
palliated; nor ever recited, but to be condemned: All Actions are prai&s;ed or
cen&s;ured, according to their Influence on the public Happine&s;s. The Intent
of the&s;e <HI>Songs,</HI> &s;ung by their Author at their mo&s;t ge|neral and
renowned Fe&s;tivals, was to in&s;pire his Countrymen with the Love of Glory
and of Virtue. To this great End, he animated them, not only by the Example and
Prai&s;e of the Victors in the <HI>Olympic Games</HI>; but a&s;cended into
pa&s;t Times, and drew from thence the &s;hining Acts of Gods and Heroes, who
had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by Valour, Arts, or Virtues.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="86">And here, in Ju&s;tice to this great Poet we
mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that PINDAR's Songs, con&s;idered in this

Difficulty which hath at all Times embarra&s;&s;ed his Commentators and
Cri|tics; who have ever cen&s;ured his &s;eeming Irregularities and &s;udden
Flights, from the <HI>declared Heroe</HI> of his Poem, to <HI>Gods</HI> and
<HI>decea&s;ed Chieftains.</HI> But on the Principle here given, it appears,
that the Heroe of the Day was but the <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> and
<HI>incidental</HI> Subject of his Ode. The main Intent was the Prai&s;e of his
Country's Gods and Heroes, who had &s;ignalized them&s;elves by Actions
beneficent and great. When therefore he &s;eems to <HI>wander</HI> into the

<P>The three <HI>Greek</HI> TRAGEDIANS are the la&s;t of this
il|lu&s;trious Catalogue of legi&s;lative Bards: And their Writ|ings, though
very different in their Style and Manner, yet all unite in holding forth the
leading Principles of the Greek Religion, Polity, and Morals.</P>
<P>ESCHYLUS, who &s;tands fir&s;t in Order of Time, partakes much of
the rude Genius of the early Periods. His Imagery and Sentiments are great; his
Style rugged and abrupt; and of a Ca&s;t &s;o totally different from that of
HOMER, that it is a&s;toni&s;hing to hear the Critics, one after another,
affirming that HOMER was his Model<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See this Point
con&s;idered below, Art. 20.</BIBL></NOTE>. His Writings pre&s;ent to us all
the Characters of a &s;ublime, original, and uncultivated Genius, which
&s;corned any other Tutore&s;s than <HI>Nature.</HI> He was Him&s;elf a great
Warriours; <PB N="85" REF="88"> and his warlike Genius threw it&s;elf out, in
Subjects that were grand and terrible. Hence his Tragic Songs abound with the
mo&s;t gloomy and tremendous Exploits of the Gre|cian Heroes, &s;triking the
Soul with Admiration, A&s;toni&s;h|ment, and Terror.</P>
<P>SOPHOCLES appeared next; of a more &s;edate and tem|pered Maje&s;ty:
He improved on ESCHYLUS both in <HI>Plan</HI> and <HI>Morals.</HI> For the
<HI>legi&s;lative Arts</HI> were now advancing at ATHENS with great Rapidity.
No Wonder, therefore, that the Di&s;ciple conquered his Ma&s;ter; when he had
the improving Sen&s;e of his Country to elevate and inlarge his Genius. But
&s;till the Gods and Heroes of GREECE were the con&s;tant Subject of his
Song.</P>
<P>EURIPIDES, con&s;idered in the legi&s;lative View, was on a Level
with his Ma&s;ters with Re&s;pect to the Subject of his Tragedies (for the&s;e
were always drawn from the <HI>Grecian Gods</HI> or <HI>Heroes)</HI> but
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the Advantage which the &s;till improving State
of his Country gave him. For <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> was now in its A&s;cendant:
The <HI>Poet</HI> was the <HI>Di&s;ciple</HI> of an eminent <HI>Sage:</HI>
Hence the Genius of EURIPIDES carried the legi&s;lative Power of Song to its
la&s;t Perfection; and threw it&s;elf out, in &s;uch a Variety of Maxims,
<HI>political</HI> and <HI>moral,</HI> as far outwent the Art of his
Predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Such then, through the various Ages of ancient GREECE, was the
legi&s;lative Genius of their <HI>Songs</HI>; which, in their &s;everal
Periods, contained the leading Principles of their <HI>Re|ligion, Morals,</HI>
and <HI>Polity</HI>; and thus became the natural and proper Object of the

<P>The mo&s;t learned VOSSIUS proceeds on the &s;ame Mi&s;take in his

As it may &s;eem unaccount|able, how &s;o capital a Mi&s;take &s;hould creep
into the Writings of the&s;e great Authors, let me here ob&s;erve, as an
Apology for them all, that ARISTOTLE, and &s;ome &s;uc|ceeding Writers, &s;peak

natural enough for the&s;e Writers to draw their Ideas of ancient Mu&s;ic from
the great Ma&s;ter-Critic of GREECE. How it came to pa&s;s, that ARISTOTLE

<P N="13">13. "MUSIC, in its inlarged Sen&s;e, acquired a
<HI>great</HI> and <HI>general Power</HI> over the Minds and Actions of the
ancient <HI>Greeks.</HI>" It is pre&s;umed, that we have now gained an
A&s;cent, from whence this Truth will appear evident and indi&s;putable; though
it hath long been regarded by many, as an incredible Paradox.&mdash;How, or
whence, &s;uch an univer&s;al Pa&s;&s;ion for Mu&s;ic &s;hould have ari&s;en in
GREECE; or, after it had ari&s;en, how it gained &s;uch a general
E&s;ta|bli&s;hment in the important Article of Education; or, after it was thus
e&s;tabli&s;hed, how it could work &s;uch mighty Effects upon the Mind,
&s;uppo&s;ing it to con&s;i&s;t only in mere Melody;&mdash;are Que&s;tions
which wi&s;e Men have a&s;ked, and Bigots to Antiquity have weakly an&s;wered:
For the common Reply hath been, that their <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> (meaning their
<HI>Melody)</HI> was of a kind &s;o much &s;uperior to ours, that all its
wonderful Effects followed from its more exalted Nature.&mdash;On the contrary,
it appears, that as to its par|ticular Con&s;truction, we are ignorant of it:
That we have no preci&s;e or practicable Idea of their <HI>Genera,</HI> their
<HI>Modes</HI>; nor the <HI>Make,</HI> nor <HI>Power</HI> of their
<HI>In&s;truments:</HI> But that by collateral Arguments we can prove, that
their <HI>Melody</HI> was &s;omething altogether <HI>&s;imple</HI> and
<HI>inartificial</HI>; &s;uch as State&s;|men, Warriours, and Bards, occupied
in other Pur&s;uits, could compo&s;e; and &s;uch as high and low, Children and
Men bu&s;ied in other concerns of Life, could learn and practi&s;e. That hence
we are led to believe, that what|ever <PB N="92" REF="95" MS="y"> ever Effects
aro&s;e from the mere <HI>Melody,</HI> aro&s;e from its <HI>Rythm</HI> or
<HI>Mea&s;ure,</HI> heightened by early <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> and continued
<HI>Habit</HI>; by which it became a kind of natural <HI>Language</HI> of the
Pa&s;&s;ions. It appears farther, that <HI>Melody</HI> formed but a
<HI>Part</HI> of the ancient <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI>; and that its mo&s;t important
and e&s;&s;ential Branch was that of <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> or <HI>Song.</HI> But for
a clear and full View of the Origin and Union of their <HI>Melody</HI> and
<HI>Song,</HI> it was nece&s;&s;ary to go back, and be|gin our Inquiries at the
early Period of &s;avage Life, in which all the Seeds and Principles of
civilized Society ap|pear in their native and uncultivated State. This Method
of Inve&s;tigation hath opened to us an involved and clouded Subject. Hence it
appears, that <HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song,</HI> naturally aro&s;e in
<HI>Union</HI>; that <HI>Mea&s;ure, Rythm,</HI> and <HI>Num|bers,</HI> were the
certain Con&s;equence: That in the earlie&s;t Times of GREECE, the Characters
of <HI>Legi&s;lator</HI> and <HI>Bard</HI> did often and naturally
<HI>coale&s;ce:</HI> That hence their earlie&s;t Hi&s;tories, Laws, and
Oracles, were of cour&s;e written in Ver&s;e; that their religious Rites were
naturally, and with|out po&s;itive Appointment, performed or accompanied by
Melody, Dance, and Song: That through the &s;everal im|proving Periods of Time,
their Songs were more and more of a true legi&s;lative Ca&s;t; that they
included all the great Actions of their Gods and Heroes, and that in the&s;e
were contained the leading Principles of their Religion, Morals, and Polity:
That <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> in this its inlarged Sen&s;e, bore an e&s;&s;ential and
principal Part in the Education of their Children; being the plea&s;ing and
powerful Vehicle, by which all the important Precepts of Life were in&s;tilled
into their tender Minds.&mdash;Thus naturally <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> aro&s;e, and was
<HI>powerfully e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> in ancient GREECE: And from this 
<PB N="93" REF="96"> View of its Nature and e&s;tabli&s;hment, its <HI>general
Influence</HI> mu&s;t unavoidably follow: 
<Q REND="inline">"For through the Force of early and continued Habit,

natu|rally produced the mo&s;t la&s;ting Effects, and &s;uch as no future
Incidents of Life could ea&s;ily weaken or efface."</Q></P>
<P>On the&s;e principles we may naturally explain &s;ome of the
recorded Effects of ancient Mu&s;ic, which according to the common
Interpretation of the Word, have been liable to the Deri&s;ion of modern
Critics.</P>
<P>We read, that &s;uch was the Power of ancient Mu&s;ic, that when
AGAMEMNON went to TROY, the de&s;igning EGIS|THUS could not debauch
CLITEMNESTRA, till he had decoyed away the <HI>Mu&s;ician</HI> that was
retained in the Palace. This Account, if we under&s;tand by <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> no
more than <HI>Melody,</HI> hath much the Air of Hyperbole and Fable. But if we
regard the <HI>Mu&s;ician</HI> as what indeed he was, the Di&s;|pen&s;er of
<HI>religious</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> Principles, and that he urged the great
Duty of conjugal Fidelity with the united Powers of poetic Eloquence and Song;
and urged them to one who&s;e Education had made her &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch
Im|pre&s;&s;ions, the fabulous Appearances di&s;&s;olve; and we &s;ee, that no
other Method could have been devi&s;ed, &s;o effectual for the Pre&s;ervation
of a weak Woman's Virtue.</P>
<P>Again; we are told, that certain young Men heated with Wine, had
agreed to a&s;&s;ault the Doors of a mode&s;t <PB N="94" REF="97"> Woman, and
abu&s;e her as a Pro&s;titute: but that an able Mu&s;ician coming pa&s;t, he
&s;ung and played to them in the <HI>Dorian</HI> Mode; on which they were
&s;truck with Shame, and de&s;i&s;ted from their Enterprize<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">This Story is ridiculed in the <HI>Memoirs</HI> of MARTINUS
SCRIBLERUS: And the Ridicule is founded on an entire Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, or
Mi&s;|repre&s;entation, of the true nature of <HI>ancient</HI> MUSIC.</NOTE>.
This, to modern Comprehen&s;ion, hath &s;till more the Air of Fable: But when
the Fact is well explained, the Ridicule vani&s;heth with the My&s;tery. For
every <HI>different Subject</HI> had a <HI>diffe|rent Mode</HI> annexed to it.
This appears at large from PLATO. 
<Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t adapt the Mode to the Subject and Words,
not the&s;e to the Mode or Harmony: On the&s;e Matters we will farther
deliberate with DAMON, what Feet or Mea&s;ures are fitte&s;t to expre&s;s
Illiberality, Petu|lance, frantic Folly, and other Vices; and what Mea&s;ures
be&s;t expre&s;s their contrary Virtues. <HI>Hence</HI> it is, that Rythm and
Numbers gain their Power in the mu&s;ical Edu|cation, and exerci&s;e their
mighty Influence on the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Soul<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Repub.</HI> l. iii.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Tis plain,
therefore, that when the Hi&s;torian tells us, that the Mu&s;ician conquered
the young Debauchees by an Application of the <HI>Dorian</HI> Mode, he means to
&s;ignify, that the Melody was accompanied by a <HI>poetic Exhortation</HI>
&s;uited to the Numbers; and this could be no other than a Le&s;&s;on of
<HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Temperance</HI>; which being conveyed by the
plea&s;ing Vehicle of Melody and Song, addre&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e who by the
Tenor of their Education mu&s;t feel its Force, and given by one who&s;e
Pro|fe&s;&s;ion they had been taught to reverence, could hardly fail 
<PB N="95" REF="98"> of its de&s;igned Effects, unle&s;s their Intemperance had
pre|vented all Attention.</P>
<P>There are other recorded Effects of ancient Mu&s;ic of a &s;imilar
Nature, which it is not nece&s;&s;ary to produce here, becau&s;e they may all
be accounted for on the &s;ame Prin|ciple. With Re&s;pect to the traditionary
Influence of this Art on wild Bea&s;ts, Stocks, and Stones, as it came down
from the ignorant and fabulous Times, &s;o nothing can be ju&s;tly concluded
from it, but the Force of Mu&s;ic over the Minds of unin&s;tructed and
wondering Barbarians.</P>
<P>Thus the boa&s;ted Power of the ancient <HI>Greek Mu&s;ic</HI>
&s;eems naturally and fully accounted for. And in Confirmation of this
Solution, we may finally appeal to the &s;avage Tribes with whom this Inquiry
began. For by Means parallel in mo&s;t other Re&s;pects, &s;ave only in the
Article of Legi&s;la|tion and Letters, they animate each other by the early and

in Torments and Death<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LAFITAU, tom. iii. p. 171.

the Rea&s;on given above<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Sect. iv. Art.
14.</BIBL></NOTE>. And that this was the real Generation of the
<HI>Gymna&s;tic</HI> Art, appears evidently from PLATO's Book of <HI>Laws:</HI>
where, having &s;poken of the three con&s;tituent Parts of a compleat
<HI>Choir</HI> (Melody, Dance, and Song) he proceeds to deduce from the&s;e the
Origin of the <HI>Gymna&s;tic</HI> Art. 
<Q REND="inline">"Is not this the leading Principle of the

<HI>Dance: Melody</HI> natu|rally begets <HI>Rythm</HI>; and the&s;e two

However, if it needs a Proof, another Pa&s;&s;age of the &s;ame Author will
&s;ufficiently confirm it.

<P>We trace the Foundation and Progre&s;s of the <HI>Gymna&s;tic</HI>
Art no le&s;s clearly in LUCIAN's Account. 
<Q REND="inline">"The <HI>Spar|tans,</HI> having received this Art
(of Dancing) from CAS|TOR and POLLUX, went <HI>dancing</HI> to <HI>Battle,</HI>
to the Sound of Flutes: Their Application to Mu&s;ic did not le&s;&s;en their
Attention to Arms: For a Mu&s;ician &s;at in the mid&s;t of the A&s;&s;embly,
and played on the Flute, beating Time with his Foot; while they regularly
followed the Mea&s;ure, in a Variety of warlike Po&s;tures<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De Saltatione.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>To confirm the&s;e Evidences, we may add another In|&s;tance of a
warlike <HI>Dance,</HI> which approacheth neare&s;t to the E&s;tabli&s;hment of
the <HI>Gymna&s;tic</HI> Exerci&s;e, of any record|ed by Antiquity. XENOPHON,
in his "Expedition of CYRUS," de&s;cribes one of the&s;e Dances in the
following Manner. 
<Q REND="inline">"The <HI>Fea&s;t</HI> being ended, the
<HI>Libations</HI> made, and the <HI>Hymn</HI> &s;ung, two <HI>Thracians,</HI>
completely armed, began to dance to the Sound of the Flute: After
&s;kir|mi&s;hing for &s;ome time with their Swords, one of them (as wounded)
fell down, on which the <HI>Paphlagonians</HI> &s;et up a loud Cry. The

<HI>Gymna&s;tic</HI> Exer|ci&s;e in their mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Circum&s;tances,
yet the original Form of the <HI>Dance</HI> remains.</P>
<P>Thus the Origin of the <HI>Gymna&s;tic</HI> Arts is clearly
un|folded, as being no more than a Part of the &s;avage <HI>Song-Fea&s;t</HI>; 
<PB N="98" REF="101"> <HI>Fea&s;t</HI>; but &s;eparated from thence for the
Ends of war|like Service. For Want of this Information, the learned VOSSIUS,
among other Authors, &s;tiles the <HI>Dance</HI> a Branch of the

<P>Here we may farther ob&s;erve, that this View of the
<HI>Gymna&s;tic,</HI> con&s;idered as having been originally a Branch of the
<HI>Mu&s;ical</HI> Art, clears up a Difficulty with which every other Account
of it is encumbered. Thus a late Writer &s;ays, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Exerci&s;e of <HI>leaping</HI> in the

<HI>Pythian</HI> Airs, as PAUSA|NIAS informs us. Whence this Cu&s;tom was
derived, I cannot &s;ay: And the Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for it by that Author,

the Principle here given, the Cu&s;tom accounts for it&s;elf. In the fir&s;t

made a <HI>Part</HI> of them: This <HI>Part</HI> had been di&s;u&s;ed (by

which the other Kinds only catch incidentally, I mean, the &s;udden Shocks and

<P>HERODOTUS, indeed, has thrown out a Hint, as if the <HI>Iliad</HI>

the&s;e remote Ages is &s;o dark and fabulous, that nothing can with Certainty
be collected from them. But the very Structure of HOMER's Poem carries in
it&s;elf &s;uch an internal Evidence, as turns the Scale again&s;t the
Hi&s;torian's Conjecture. If we con&s;ider the Nature of the human Mind, we
&s;hall be led to believe, that the <HI>Epic</HI> Poem mu&s;t have received a
<HI>gradual</HI> Improvement through that long though unknown Tract of Time,
during which its unpoli&s;hed Rudiments exi&s;ted before the Age of HO|MER. The

proved his utter In|ability by his Attempt; which &s;ucceeding Poets have made
their Model, yet none have ever equalled or approached, &s;ave only the

This, which required the highe&s;t Efforts of an improved Under&s;tanding,

at once emerge in all the Extent of Art, in the mid&s;t of rude and unformed
Fables, &s;ung at Fe&s;tivals as vague Enthu&s;ia&s;m might
in&s;pire;&mdash;this is an Opinion re|pugnant to all our Notices concerning
the Progre&s;s of the Powers of the human Mind. We may as rationally
&s;up|po&s;e that St. PAUL's was the fir&s;t built Temple, its <HI>Organ</HI>
the fir&s;t mu&s;ical In&s;trument, the LAOCOON and his Sons the fir&s;t
Attempt in Statuary, the <HI>Transfiguration</HI> the fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay in
Picture, as that the <HI>&s;tupendous Iliad,</HI> the Wonder of all
&s;ucceeding Ages, was the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Attempt in <HI>Epic</HI>
Poetry.</P>
<P>What the Nature of the Thing &s;o &s;trongly declares, ARISTOTLE
&s;eems to confirm in his Poetics: For he &s;ays, that 
<Q REND="inline">"although we know not the Names either of the Poems

<P>We may rea&s;onably conclude, therefore, that from the Days of

<P>That the&s;e Epic Songs, in their &s;everal Periods, were &s;ung by
their Compo&s;ers to the &s;urrounding People, we have the general Te&s;timony
of ancient Writers. This Fact is &s;o clear, with Re&s;pect to the elder Poets
of GREECE, that it is much que&s;tioned whether ever their <HI>Songs</HI> were
committed to <HI>Writing:</HI> Whether they were any more than the extempore
Efforts of a &s;udden En|thu&s;ia&s;m, kindled by the &s;ympathetic Power of

the honourable Profe&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Bard,</HI> and &s;ung his own Poems at

<P N="19">19. "From an <HI>Union</HI> of the&s;e two Kinds, a certain
rude Outline of <HI>Tragedy</HI> aro&s;e."&mdash;For when a Bard &s;ung the
great or terrible Atchievements of a Heroe or God, the &s;urrounding
<HI>Audience,</HI> fired to Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and already prepared by a
corre&s;pondent Education, would naturally <PB N="106" REF="109"> break forth
into the Raptures of a <HI>choral Song.</HI>&mdash;This Progre&s;&s;ion of
Poetry is &s;o natural, that it is Matter of A&s;toni&s;hment to hear the
learned at all Times a&s;cribing the Ri&s;e of Tragedy to Cau&s;es merely
accidental; and confining it to the &s;ingle Adventure of THESPIS and his
Route, &s;inging the Prai&s;es of BACCHUS at a <HI>ca&s;ual</HI> Vin|tage. Thus
DACIER, among others, affirms roundly, that 
<Q REND="inline">"The fir&s;t dramatic Per&s;on which THESPIS
<HI>invented,</HI> was only <HI>de&s;igned</HI> to give Re&s;pite to the Choir;
and what he recited was no more than an Appendage to Tragedy<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Sur les Poet D' Ari&s;t.</HI> p. 47.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q>
In the &s;ame Manner the &s;en&s;ible and learned BRUMOY delivers at large the

<HI>tragic</HI> Species<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Theat. des
Grecs.</HI> tom. vi. p. 310, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>. All this is in
Contradiction to the Workings of Nature; and, without Proof, &s;uppo&s;es That
to be a <HI>ca&s;ual Invention</HI> in a <HI>particular</HI> In&s;tance, which
was indeed the <HI>natural Progre&s;s</HI> of Pa&s;&s;ion expre&s;&s;ed by
<HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI> We have &s;een, that an Union of
Nar|ration and concurrent Shouts of Prai&s;e takes Place even in the rude
Fe&s;tivals of the &s;avage Tribes: 'Tis altogether repugnant, therefore, to
the Nature of Things to &s;up|po&s;e, when <HI>Letters</HI> had given Accents
to the Rapture of the &s;urrounding Audience, and moulded the Ode into Form,
that this natural Union &s;hould not be upheld. Though, therefore, the fir&s;t
Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of the tragic Species in GREECE were hid in Darkne&s;s,
through a Want of recording Hi&s;tory, yet, from a Similarity of Cau&s;es and
Effects which we find among the barbarous Nations of AMERICA, we might fairly
conclude, that it had not a <PB N="107" REF="110" MS="y"> <HI>ca&s;ual,</HI>
but a <HI>certain</HI> Ri&s;e from <HI>Nature</HI>; according to the Principles
here given.</P>
<P>But ancient Hi&s;tory is not &s;ilent on this Subject. It gives us a
Variety of Facts, which overturn the common Sy&s;tem, and tend to confirm what
is here advanced. PLATO &s;ays expre&s;ly, that 
<Q REND="inline">"Tragedy was very ancient in the City of ATHENS, and
practi&s;ed there, long before the Age of THESPIS<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>MINOS.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> We are a&s;&s;ured, on the
Au|thority of other Writers, that

<P>But a &s;till &s;tronger Evidence pre&s;ents it&s;elf: For even the
very Sub&s;tance and Form of one of the&s;e rude Out|lines of &s;avage Tragedy
remains in a re&s;pectable Author of Antiquity. 
<Q REND="inline">"In ancient Times (&s;aith STRABO) there was a

<P>Nay, as a farther Confirmation, not only of this parti|cular

<P>It appears, therefore, that Tragedy had a much earlier and deeper

adding a <HI>&s;econd Per&s;on</HI> to the Drama, brought in the U&s;e of
<HI>Dialogue.</HI></P>
<P>Here, for the Sake of Truth, we mu&s;t again depart from the general
Body of Critics; mo&s;t of whom, from ARIS|TOTLE down to our own Times, unite
in &s;uppo&s;ing rhat ESCHYLUS was only a ca&s;ual Imitator of HOMER, and drew
the Idea of all his Tragedies from the ILIAD. A noble Critic of our own Country
hath affirmed this in the fewe&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Terms; and &s;ays, that 
<Q REND="inline">"There was no more left for Tragedy to do after him
(HOMER) than to erect a Stage, and draw his Dialogues and Characters into
Scenes<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Characteri&s;tic,</HI> vol. i. p.

<P>It may be deemed pre&s;umptuous, perhaps, to que&s;tion a Point
wherein the great Ma&s;ter-Critic of GREECE hath him&s;elf decided. But let us
remember, that the Days are now pa&s;t, when it was held a Point of Honour, to
<HI>&s;wear</HI> to the <HI>Opinions</HI> of a <HI>Ma&s;ter.</HI> ARISTOTLE is
often ad|mirable, generally judicious, yet &s;ometimes perhaps mi&s;|taken,
even in his Judgment of Men and Things relative to his own Country. He was more
e&s;pecially capable of being mi&s;led by the common Opinion in this Point; in
which neither He nor any of his Countrymen could be &s;ufficiently informed,
for Want of a competent Knowledge of the Genius and Character of &s;avage
Manners.</P>
<P>That ESCHYLUS was not a mere Imitator of HOMER, that he was a great
and original Poet, who exalted his Art one Degree beyond his Predece&s;&s;ors
in his own Country, &s;eems <PB N="111" REF="114"> a Point which collateral
Arguments &s;trongly confirm. We are informed, in general Terms, that there
were no le&s;s than fifteen tragic Poets who writ before him: And the
Probability is much &s;tronger, that he &s;hould draw his Improvement from the
<HI>&s;cenic</HI> Repre&s;entations already e&s;tabli&s;hed, in which he found
one dramatic Per&s;on and an accompanying <HI>Choir,</HI> which, in all
Probability, &s;tood in the Place of a &s;econd Per&s;on, and often
&s;u&s;tained a Kind of Dialogue with the principal Interlocutor<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">This Opinion receives a &s;trong Confirmation from the following
Circum&s;tance, that in the <HI>Greek Tragedies</HI> which have come down to
us, whenever there is a <HI>&s;ingle Interlocutor</HI> on the Stage, the
<HI>Choir</HI> frequently maintains a <HI>Dialogue</HI> with him.</NOTE>; than
that he &s;hould have Recour&s;e to HOMER's Poems, in which no dramatic
Repre&s;entation was to be found.</P>
<P>To this Argument may be added another, drawn from the Style and
Manner of ESCHYLUS, &s;o different from that of HOMER. For HOMER is equal,
large, flowing, and harmonious: ESCHYLUS is uneven, conci&s;e, abrupt, and
rugged: The one leads you through the grand but gentle Declivities of Hill and
Dale; the other carries you over a continued Chain of Rocks and Precipices. Now
if HOMER had been the Model of ESCHYLUS, &s;ome <HI>Similarity</HI> of
<HI>Manner</HI> would probably have en&s;ued.</P>
<P>A third and &s;till &s;tronger Proof ari&s;es from the e&s;&s;ential
Difference of their Subjects, both in Extent and Nature: In Extent, becau&s;e
the one is of <HI>long,</HI> the other of &s;hort Duration: In Nature,
becau&s;e HOMER's Poems are chiefly employed in the Exhibition of
<HI>Character</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI>; tho&s;e of ESCHYLUS in the
Repre&s;entation of <HI>Terror</HI> and <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s.</HI> Had he been that
mere Imitator of HOMER which the Critics have adjudged him, and had nothing to 
<PB N="112" REF="115"> do but to erect a Stage, and to draw HOMER's Dialogues
into Scenes, he would have been content to have taken <HI>his</HI> Subjects
from the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and, according to HORACE's &s;ober Rule, have never
ventured beyond the Siege of <HI>Troy</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>RECTIUS ILIACOS, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>. He would have
brought upon the Stage the Anger of ACHILLES, the Battle of PARIS and MENELAUS,
the Part|ing of HECTOR and ANDROMACHE, the Feats of DIO|MEDE; and would have
contra&s;ted the <HI>&s;trength</HI> of AJAX with the <HI>Cunning</HI> of
ULYSSES. Nothing of all this ap|pears: On the contrary, his <HI>Subjects</HI>
and <HI>Manner</HI> are equal|ly <HI>his own</HI>; and <HI>both</HI> of a
Genius oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of HOMER.</P>
<P>What PLUTARCH &s;ays of HOMER, though brought for the contrary
Purpo&s;e, tends to confirm all that is here ad|vanced. 
<Q REND="inline">"Even Tragedy took its Ri&s;e from HOMER: For his

will &s;ay, is a very in&s;ufficient Rea&s;on, becau&s;e the Critic forgets the
<HI>pathetic</HI> and the <HI>terrible,</HI> which were the e&s;&s;ential
Con&s;tituents of the Greek Tragedy. But mark the Sequel; which is &s;till more
ex|traordinary.

PLUTARCH is labouring to prove, that the <HI>Greek</HI> Tragedy was
<HI>drawn</HI> from HOMER, he proves, that HOMER's Poems were

<P>We may fairly conclude, then, that the Improvement which Tragedy

in the &s;ame Circle.</P>
<P>Let us attend, therefore, to its Con&s;equences. As each

<P N="22">22. "Another Con&s;equence of the e&s;tabli&s;hed
<HI>Choir</HI> was a &s;trict and unvaried Adherence to the <HI>Unities</HI> of

little Illu&s;tration. A numerous <HI>Choir,</HI> maintaining their Station

<HI>Time,</HI> that any Deviation from this ap|parent Unity mu&s;t have
&s;hocked the Imagination with an Improbability too gro&s;s to be indured.
Notwith&s;tanding all the Panegyrics of the Critics, therefore, upon the Greek

<Q REND="inline">"It mu&s;t be owned, that we cannot well comprehend,

The learned Critic is &s;o &s;hocked with this &s;uppo&s;ed Union, in
Appearance &s;o unnatural, that upon the whole he que&s;tions its Exi&s;tence;
and is of Opinion, that when ARISTOTLE &s;peaks of <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> as being
annexed to <HI>Tragedy,</HI> he &s;peaks of the <HI>Choir</HI> only<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. This, however, is contrary to the
united Voice of Antiquity, which univer&s;ally admits the Fact, though its
Origin was never accounted for. But how naturally this union took Place in
ancient Tragedy, we now clearly di&s;cover, by inve&s;tigating the Ri&s;e and
Pro|gre&s;s of this Poem from the &s;avage State. For it appears, that the
<HI>Epic</HI> and <HI>Ode</HI> were both &s;ung from the earlie&s;t Periods;
and therefore, when they became <HI>united,</HI> and by that Union formed the
tragic Species, they of Cour&s;e maintained the &s;ame Appendage of
<HI>Melody,</HI> which Nature and Cu&s;tom had already given them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Abb&eacute; du</HI> Bos endeavours to prove, indeed, that
the <HI>Song</HI> which was employed in the <HI>Epi&s;ode</HI> of ancient
Tra|gedy <PB N="116" REF="119"> was no more than a Kind of <HI>regulated</HI>
or <HI>mea&s;ured Declamation</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Reflec.
Crit.</HI> Part iii. c. 4, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>. But his Inquiries are
partial; for he goes no higher than to the Practice of the <HI>Romans:</HI> And
it is probable, from &s;everal Circum&s;tances, that in the late Period when
the <HI>Romans</HI> borrowed their Mu&s;ic from, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the
Tragic <HI>Song</HI> had been brought down from a <HI>mea&s;ured Melody</HI> to
a kind of <HI>regulated Declamation.</HI> Thus, TULLY mentions the <HI>Cantus
Subob&s;curus</HI>; and again &s;aith, 
<Q REND="inline">"Delicatiores &s;unt fal&s;ae Voculae quam certae et
&s;everae."</Q> But though the&s;e, with &s;everal other Argu|ments alledged by
the <HI>Abb&eacute;,</HI> &s;eem to imply that the tragic <HI>Song</HI> was
little more than a mea&s;ured Recitation; yet this will by no means prove, that
a more full and direct Song had not been u&s;ed in Tragedy thro' the more early
Periods. In the Cour&s;e of this Di&s;&s;ertation, the Practice of
<HI>&s;inging</HI> Tragedy hath been traced from its fir&s;t Ri&s;e in &s;avage
Manners; which at once de&s;troys the <HI>Improbability</HI> of the Cu&s;tom,
and proves that it was even founded in Nature; a Circum&s;tance, of which the

laid, we cannot but li&s;ten attentively to what the early Writers of GREECE
tell us on this Subject: Now the&s;e unite in informing us, that the
<HI>Epi&s;ode</HI> of Tragedy was <HI>Sung</HI>; and even name the
<HI>Modes</HI> of Mu&s;ic which were appropriated to the <HI>Epi&s;ode,</HI> in
Contradi&s;tinction to the <HI>Choir</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ARISTOT. <HI>Prob.</HI> 19.</BIBL></NOTE>. That the
<HI>Song</HI> &s;hould approach nearer, by Degrees, to mere Declamation, will
appear probable, when we con&s;ider the gradual Sepa|rations which
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively took Place in the mu&s;ical Art, during the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
Periods of GREECE and ROME. <PB N="117" REF="120"> To mention only one
In&s;tance here, &s;imilar to what we now treat of: ARISTOTLE informs us, that
in <HI>His</HI> Time the <HI>Rhap&s;odi&s;ts,</HI> who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion it
was to <HI>&s;ing</HI> the Poems of HOMER and HESIOD, were beginning to make

<P>The <HI>Abb&eacute;</HI> falls into an Error with Re&s;pect to the
<HI>Dance,</HI> parallel to that which he adopts with Regard to the
<HI>Melody</HI> of the Ancients. As he in&s;i&s;ts that their <HI>tragic
Melody</HI> was only a <HI>mea&s;ured Recitation,</HI> &s;o he affirms, that
their <HI>tragic Dance</HI> was no more than <HI>Action</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Reflec.</HI> Part. iii. c. 13.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is
true, that in the later Periods of <HI>Rome,</HI> when the mu&s;ical
Sepa|rations had taken Place, this was the general Meaning of the Word
<HI>Saltatio:</HI> And hence, as in his Opinion of the tragic Song, his
Mi&s;take aro&s;e. For it is evident from the concurrent Te&s;timony of the
elder <HI>Greek</HI> Writers, that the <HI>tragic Dance</HI> was performed in
the very Manner here de|&s;cribed. We now &s;ee, that this <HI>Dance</HI> (no

<HI>with this View.</HI> It is not the Writer's De&s;ign to remark on this
great Critic, far|ther than what relates to his main Subject. Therefore it will
&s;uffice to &s;ay, that if ARISTOTLE meant to a&s;&s;ign this <HI>moral
End,</HI> as the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> why Tragedy a&s;&s;umed this Form in ancient
GREECE, and adopted Subjects of <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s</HI> and <HI>Terror,</HI> He
&s;eems to have taken That for a <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> which was a <HI>natural
Effect</HI> of the ruling <HI>Manners</HI> of the <HI>Greek</HI> Republics. The
Rea&s;ons which &s;upport the general Truth, already given in the
corre&s;pondent Article, will hold their Force when applied here. For thus the
<HI>Greeks</HI> animat|ed each other to <HI>Victory</HI> and <HI>Revenge,</HI>
by a Repre&s;entation of what their Friends had <HI>done</HI> and
<HI>&s;uffered.</HI> The&s;e Sub|jects would likewi&s;e be mo&s;t accommodated
to the natural Ta&s;te of the poetic Chiefs of &s;uch a People; who&s;e
<HI>At|chievements</HI> produced and abounded with Events of
<HI>Di&s;|tre&s;s</HI> and <HI>Terror.</HI> Such then was the natural Origin
and Adoption of the&s;e Subjects in the <HI>Greek Tragedy:</HI> But after they
were e&s;tabli&s;hed on this Foundation, 'tis proba|ble that the State&s;men
encouraged and applied them to the <HI>Ends</HI> of Policy. For as the leading
View of a fierce and warlike People mu&s;t be to <HI>de&s;troy Pity</HI> and
<HI>Fear</HI>; &s;o This would mo&s;t effectually be done, by making
them&s;elves familiar with di&s;tre&s;sful and terrible Repre|&s;entations.
Under the&s;e Re&s;trictions, the Opinion of ARISTOTLE may have a Foundation in
Nature: Farther than this; and as applied to any People who&s;e End is not
<HI>War</HI> and <HI>Conque&s;t,</HI> it carries the Appearance of a refined
Idea, which hath no Foundation in Nature. The grand &s;cenic Repre&s;entations
of the <HI>Peruvians</HI> and <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> (as <PB N="119" REF="122">

who&s;e leading Object was <HI>Peace,</HI> are known to be of a quite contrary
Nature, formed on their gentler Manners; and &s;uch as would have been
alto|gether incompatible with the warlike Character, and in|&s;ipid to the
Ta&s;te of the Tribes of ancient GREECE.</P>
<P N="25">25. "Their Tragedy being de&s;igned as a vi&s;ible
Repre|&s;entation of their ancient Gods and Heroes, they in|vented a Method of
&s;trengthening the Voice, and ag|grandizing the Vi&s;age and Per&s;on, as the
Means of com|pleating the Re&s;emblance." It is generally known, that the old
<HI>Grecian Gods</HI> were &s;uppo&s;ed to be of a Stature <HI>ex|ceeding</HI>
that of <HI>ordinary</HI> Men: And the true Rea&s;on of that Opinion was,
becau&s;e in the early Ages they (like every other barbarous People<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See LAFITAU, and other Travellers.</BIBL></NOTE>) &s;elected
the <HI>talle&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;tronge&s;t</HI> Men for their

<P>By thus tracing the <HI>Bu&s;kin</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;que</HI> to their

<P N="26">26. "As their <HI>tragic Poets</HI> were <HI>Singers,</HI>
&s;o they were <HI>Actors,</HI> and generally performed &s;ome capital Part, in

<P>The <HI>tragic Conte&s;ts,</HI> which followed on the Improve|ment

<Q>"The People (of ATHENS) did not in former Times controul the Laws,
but willingly obeyed them. I mean tho&s;e Laws which were made concerning
Mu&s;ic. For Mu&s;ic was then preci&s;ely di&s;tingui&s;hed into its &s;everal
Kinds: One was appropriated to the Supplication and Prai&s;es of the Gods:
The&s;e were called <HI>Hymns.</HI> An|other Species was the lamenting or
pathetic: A third was the <HI>Paean</HI> or Song of Triumph: A fourth was the
<HI>Dithyrambic</HI>; and a fifth con&s;i&s;ted in &s;inging ancient
<HI>Laws</HI> or <HI>Proverbs</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Art.
6.</BIBL></NOTE>. In The&s;e and other Subjects e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law, it was
not allowed to u&s;e one Kind of Melody in&s;tead of another: Each Kind had its
par|ticular Appropriation. The Power of deciding on The&s;e, and of condemning
in Ca&s;e of Di&s;obedience, was not committed to the Hi&s;&s;es and fooli&s;h
Clamours of the Multitude, as is now the Practice: Neither was the Liberty of
intemperate Prai&s;e allowed to a noi&s;y Croud: This Deci&s;ion was left to
Men di&s;tingui&s;hed by their Sen&s;e and Knowledge; and a general Silence was
maintained, till they had heard the Conclu&s;ion of the Work. The young Men,
their Governors, and all the People, were obedient to the Motions of a Wand.
While this good Order was maintained, the Multitude 
<PB N="131" REF="134" MS="y"> willingly obeyed, nor dared to decide any thing
in a tumultuous Manner. But in Cour&s;e of Time, the Poets them&s;elves were
acce&s;&s;ary to a fatal Change in Mu&s;ic: They wanted not Genius; but had no
Regard to what was ju&s;t and legitimate; running into Extravagance, and too
much indulging the Vein of Plea&s;ure. Hence they confounded all the &s;everal
Kinds together; affirm|ing that <HI>mere Ta&s;te</HI> and <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI>
whether it were that of a <HI>good</HI> or a <HI>wicked</HI> Man, was the only
<HI>Criterion</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;ic.</HI> In Con&s;equence of this, they
compo&s;ed their <HI>Poems</HI> on the &s;ame Principle; and thus rendered the
<HI>Multitude</HI> &s;o <HI>bold</HI> and <HI>daring</HI> again&s;t the
<HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed Mu&s;ic,</HI> that they a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the
&s;ole Right of de|ciding on it. Hence the Theatres began to be in Up|roar,
where formerly Silence had reigned: And thus the Privilege of <HI>judging</HI>
fell from the <HI>Rulers</HI> of the State to the <HI>Dregs</HI> of the People.
Had this Authority been a&s;&s;umed by the <HI>liberal</HI> Part of the City,
no great Harm had followed: But now, from this <HI>corrupt Change</HI> in
<HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> a <HI>general Licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of <HI>Opinion</HI>
hath en&s;ued.&mdash;The Con&s;equence of this hath been, that we no longer are
di&s;po&s;ed to obey the Magi&s;trate: Hence too, that other Evil flows, that
we de&s;pi&s;e the Authority and Precepts of our Parents, and the Advice and
Wi&s;dom of Old Age. And as we are ri&s;ing towards the Extreme of this
Corruption, we now refu&s;e Obedience to the Laws: And to fill up the Mea&s;ure

&s;ee a particular Delineation of the Progre&s;s of this Evil, which PLATO here
de&s;cribes in general Terms.</P>
<P>Let us conclude this Article with the Explanation of Subjects which
hath not hitherto been clearly treated of, for want of a ju&s;t Idea of the
ancient <HI>Greek Mu&s;ic.</HI> The learned VOSSIUS thus expre&s;&s;eth
him&s;elf: 
<Q REND="inline">"It is a doubtful Point, whether we &s;hould &s;ay,
that on a Change of Mu&s;ic, a Change of Manners en&s;ues; or that a Change of
Manners produceth a Change in Mu&s;ic: The fir&s;t was DAMON's Opinion which
PLATO follows: But CICERO leans to the latter Sy&s;tem<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>VOSSIUS.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> On this Pa&s;&s;age it is
nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to ob&s;erve, that both VOSSIUS and CICERO u&s;e the Word
<HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> in its <HI>modern</HI> Acceptation, as implying mere
<HI>Melody.</HI> No Wonder, therefore, if they had but an imperfect
Comprehen&s;ion of PLATO's Argu|ment. Secondly, On the Principles delivered in
this Di&s;|&s;ertation, it will appear, that PLATO was of both the&s;e
Opinions, 
<Q REND="inline">"That Manners influenced Mu&s;ic, and Mu&s;ic
influenced Manners."</Q> In the Pa&s;&s;age which VOSSIUS refers to, where the
Opinion of DAMON is delivered, PLATO &s;peaks of a Change in Mu&s;ic as
influencing the Manners of a Commonwealth: This Change he regards, as opening a
Door for Confu&s;ion and Novelty in an Affair of public Con&s;equence;
&s;imilar to a Neglect of Reverence to old Men, Parents, or Magi&s;trates, or
any other ancient and approved Cu&s;toms that were connected with the public
Welfare: and in this Re&s;pect, the Influence of the Greek 
<PB N="133" REF="136" MS="y"> Mu&s;ic, as now explained, on the Manners of
Mankind is too evident to need any farther Proof.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, it is no le&s;s evident, that PLATO was of
Opinion, that a Corruption of Manners mu&s;t cor|rupt Mu&s;ic. He hath &s;hewn
us in the Pa&s;&s;age given above, that the Boldne&s;s and Degeneracy of the
People of ATHENS fir&s;t allured the Poets to deba&s;e their Art, by &s;inging
&s;uch Poems as were accommodated to their vicious Ta&s;te founded on their
vicious Manners: That as Man|ners had thus deba&s;ed Mu&s;ic, &s;o this corrupt
Mu&s;ic by a natural Reaction &s;till farther corrupted Manners, and
com|pleated the De&s;truction of Religion and Virtue.</P>
<P N="35">35. "In Con&s;equence of the&s;e Progre&s;&s;ions, a gradual
and total Separation of the Bard's complex Character en&s;ued. The Leader of
the State no longer was ambi|tious of the mu&s;ical Art; nor the Poet
de&s;cended to the Profe&s;&s;ion of Lyri&s;t, Singer, or Actor: Becau&s;e
the&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions, which in the earlie&s;t Ages had been the Means of
inculcating every thing laudable and great, grew by Degrees of le&s;s and
le&s;s Importance; and being at length perverted to the contrary Purpo&s;es,
were in the End di&s;dained by the wi&s;e and virtuous." The&s;e gra|dual
Separations of the &s;everal Branches of the Bard's complex Office, and of
Melody, Dance, and Song, are not incurious in their Progre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;We
have &s;een, that in the <HI>earlie&s;t</HI> Ages, the <HI>Gods</HI> or
<HI>Legi&s;lators</HI> them&s;elves a&s;&s;umed the full and complex Character;

The <HI>Legi&s;lators</HI> by Degrees quitted the &s;everal Parts of the
<HI>Mu&s;ician's</HI> Character; a Separation which 
<PB N="134" REF="137" MS="y"> naturally aro&s;e from decrea&s;ing
Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and increa&s;ing Cares of Government. As LINUS and ORPHEUS were
the fir&s;t, &s;o PYTHAGORAS and SOLON &s;eem to have been the la&s;t, who
<HI>compo&s;ed</HI> Songs and <HI>&s;ung</HI> them to the &s;ur|rounding
People.&mdash;The Profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Bard</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;ician</HI> was
now become a <HI>&s;econdary,</HI> but <HI>re&s;pectable</HI> Character, as
being an A&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Magi&s;trate, and an u&s;eful Servant of the
State, a Teacher of Religion and Morals. The Bard <HI>&s;ung</HI> and
<HI>played</HI> always, and led the <HI>Dance</HI> occa&s;ion|ally: But when
HOMER's Poems had eclip&s;ed every other Epic Strain, another Separation
followed: The <HI>Rhap&s;odi&s;ts</HI> aro&s;e in GREECE: They &s;ung HOMER's
Poems to large &s;urrounding Audiences: They were &s;trictly his
<HI>Repre&s;en|tatives,</HI> who now gave his Poems to the People, with that
poetic Fire and Rapture which the Bard him&s;elf had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and
exerted: For in PLATO's <HI>Ion,</HI> the <HI>Rhap&s;odi&s;t</HI> &s;ays, that

&s;ung: But in the Time of SOPHOCLES, another Separation, parallel to the
la&s;t, en&s;ued; and the Province of <HI>Actor</HI> began to be di|&s;tinct
from that of <HI>Poet.</HI>&mdash;Soon after this Time, we find in the
Pa&s;&s;age quoted above from PLATO, that a Separa|tion of the <HI>whole</HI>

on: For now the complex Name of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">

Corruption, and as a natural Effect of Mu&s;ic's &s;inking into a mere
<HI>Amu&s;ement,</HI> the <HI>Poet's</HI> Character became quite di&s;tinct

the Ri&s;e of another Separation: An Inroad was made into the Mu&s;e's

to unfold the Nature, Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s, Power, Perfection, and Corruption, of
MUSIC in ancient GREECE; from the earlie&s;t Times, when it was the

<HEAD>SECT. VII. Of the Origin and Progre&s;&s;ion of Comedy in ancient
GREECE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is one con&s;iderable Branch of the MUSIC of antient GREECE, I
mean COMEDY, the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;&s;ion of which, together with their
Cau&s;es, have been de&s;ignedly pa&s;&s;ed in Silence: Becau&s;e, if this
Di&s;qui&s;ition had been mixed with what hath been <PB N="138" REF="141">
delivered concerning the <HI>Ode, Epic,</HI> and <HI>Tragedy,</HI> the Chain of
Argument would have been broken; and that Order and Clearne&s;s de&s;troyed,
which it was nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve as much as po&s;&s;ible in this
involved Subject.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed, therefore, to reduce the Origin and Progre&s;s
of the <HI>Greek Comedy</HI> to their natural and e&s;&s;ential
Cau&s;es.&mdash;To point out the Ri&s;e of this Poem from &s;avage Life; to
unfold the true Rea&s;ons why it was &s;o late in taking its legitimate Form in
GREECE; and then to ex|plain, on what Foundation the <HI>old, middle,</HI> and
<HI>new</HI> Comedy, appeared in their re&s;pective
<HI>Succe&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>In the De&s;cription of the &s;avage Song Fea&s;ts, given above from
LAFITAU, it appears that the&s;e warlike Tribes 
<Q REND="inline">"are &s;till quicker at rallying, than at
prai&s;ing, each other. He who dances, takes whom&s;oever he plea&s;eth by the
Hand; and brings him forth into the mid&s;t of the A&s;&s;em|bly; to which he
yields without Re&s;i&s;tance. Mean while the Dancer continued to
<HI>&s;ing,</HI> and &s;ometimes in his Song, and &s;ometimes in the intervals,
he throws his Sarca&s;ms on the Patient, who hears him without Re|ply.&mdash;At
every <HI>bon Mot,</HI> loud Peals of Laughter ari&s;e along the Galleries, who
animate this Sport, and often oblige the Patient to cover his Head in his
Mantle<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect.
ii.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Now, if we again &s;uppo&s;e, as we have already done, that the
U&s;e of <HI>Letters</HI> &s;hould come among the&s;e &s;avage Tribes, and be
cultivated with that &s;pirit which is natural to a free and active People;
from this Picture, as given by LAFITAU, the following Con&s;equences would
naturally ari&s;e.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="139" REF="142">1. "Their ca&s;ual Strokes of Raillery
would improve into written Invectives, which would occa&s;ionally be &s;ung by
their &s;arca&s;tic Choirs." Becau&s;e nothing could be more alluring to a
People of this &s;atyric Turn, than &s;uch a Repo&s;itory of Wit and Raillery;
which, like a Quiver &s;tored with the keene&s;t Arrows, would be ever at Hand,
ready to be di&s;charged again&s;t the occa&s;ional Objects of their
Re&s;entment.</P>
<P N="2">2. "Narrative or Epic Poems of the <HI>invective</HI> or
<HI>comic</HI> Kind would likewi&s;e ari&s;e, and be occa&s;ionally &s;ung at
their public Fe&s;tivals." For the Spirit of Sarca&s;m being once awakened, it
would of cour&s;e proceed from occa&s;ional Strokes of Raillery, to the Recital
of ridiculous Actions, for the Gratification and Entertainment of a lively and
&s;atyric People.</P>
<P N="3">3. "From the&s;e two Species (the <HI>choral</HI> and
<HI>narrative</HI> united) the fir&s;t rude Outline of <HI>Comedy</HI> would
ari&s;e." We have &s;een how <HI>Tragedy</HI> aro&s;e from parallel Cau&s;es:
And The&s;e would naturally take Place in producing <HI>Comedy.</HI> For the
<HI>Narrative,</HI> already animated by Action, would ea&s;ily &s;lide into
dramatic Repre&s;entation, as in the Ri&s;e of <HI>Tragedy</HI>; and the
corre&s;pondent <HI>Peals of Laughter</HI> (by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of written
Invectives) would a&s;&s;ume the Form of a <HI>comic Choir.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. "While the &s;alutary Principles of Legi&s;lation &s;hould
prevail, Comedy thus formed, would be little encouraged by the Leaders of the
State." For the grander Kinds of Poetry, already treated of, containing the
Principles of Religion, Polity, and Morals, would draw their main Attention;
while their Comedy, being no more than the <PB N="140" REF="143" MS="y">
Vehicle of Ridicule and vague Invective, would (at mo&s;t) be only
<HI>endured</HI> by prudent Legi&s;lators.</P>
<P N="5">5. "A provident Community, of Principles uncom|monly &s;evere,
might even bani&s;h this Species of Poem, as de&s;tructive to their State."
Becau&s;e nothing could be more dangerous to a Commonwealth e&s;tabli&s;hed on
Severity of Manners, than the unbounded Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of Sentiment and
Speech, which this Comedy mu&s;t tend to produce.</P>
<P N="6">6. "If in a State of more relaxed Principles, where &s;uch
Comedy had been tolerated, a general Corruption of Manners &s;hould take Place
among the People; and if by any means, &s;uch a corrupt People &s;hould
over|power the Magi&s;trates, and a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the Reins of
Government; then, this Species of Co|medy would ri&s;e into Credit, and be
publicly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed." For the <HI>upright Leaders</HI> of the State being
<HI>depo&s;ed,</HI> and the <HI>Creatures</HI> of &s;uch a <HI>corrupt
People</HI> being &s;eated in their <HI>Place, that Comedy</HI> would now be
<HI>authorized</HI> by Law, which was mo&s;t accommodated to the
<HI>Ta&s;te</HI> and <HI>Vices</HI> of &s;uch a <HI>corrupt People.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. "The Ridicule and Invective of their Comedy, thus
e&s;tabli&s;hed, would be pointed chiefly again&s;t tho&s;e Ma|gi&s;trates, or
private Men, who&s;e Qualities would be hateful to the debauched Populace." For
Corruption being now e&s;tabli&s;hed as it were by Law; that is, by the Voice
of a degenerate People which &s;tood in the Place of Law; the Poets would find
it nece&s;&s;ary to gratify the People's Vices as the &s;ure&s;t Road to
Succe&s;s; and the mo&s;t certain Road to this mu&s;t be by the <HI>Ridicule of
Virtue.</HI></P>
<P N="8"><PB N="141" REF="144" MS="y">8. "If a <HI>Tyranny</HI>
&s;hould &s;uddenly erect it&s;elf on the Ruins of &s;uch a People, it would by
its Authority <HI>&s;ilence</HI> this Species of <HI>Comedy.</HI>"&mdash;For
every thing hateful to the People being now the e&s;tabli&s;hed Subject of the
comic Mu&s;e, the Tyrants, who had taken away the public Liberty, mu&s;t expect
to become the Subject of Comedy, if permitted to revel in its former
Licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="9">9. "The Poets would probably find a Subterfuge, for the
Gratification of the People; and continue to repre|&s;ent <HI>real
Characters</HI> under <HI>feigned Names.</HI>" For this would be the only
Species of Comedy they could pur&s;ue with a Probability of Succe&s;s: And this
might be conti|nued without much Danger, if they were cautious with Re&s;pect
to the Per&s;ons of the Tyrants.</P>
<P N="10">10. "If a great Conqueror &s;hould ari&s;e, and, by
&s;ub|duing a Variety of Nations, &s;hould open a Communi|cation between &s;uch
a State and others of more luxurious and refined Manners, this
<HI>&s;econd</HI> Species of Comedy would naturally receive a
<HI>Poli&s;h</HI>; and, in&s;tead of the in|direct per&s;onal Invective, would
a&s;&s;ume the more deli|cate Form of general Raillery, and become a Picture of
human Life."&mdash;For one of the fir&s;t Efforts of a growing Politene&s;s is
to avoid all Occa&s;ions of <HI>Offence</HI>; and this, without Re&s;pect to
any Con&s;equences, either good or bad, which may affect the Public; but merely
from a &s;elfi&s;h Regard to the Opinion of <HI>Elegance,</HI> and the Pride of
<HI>Urbanity.</HI></P>
<P>In Support of the&s;e Deductions, let us now endeavour to
<HI>realize</HI> them; by &s;hewing, that &s;uch Con&s;equences did ari&s;e in
GREECE: And in the Cour&s;e of this Argument, the Writer hopes he &s;hall be
able to di&s;clo&s;e the true Cau&s;es <PB N="142" REF="145" MS="y"> of the
Progre&s;&s;ion of the ancient Comedy, &s;o different from that of the higher
Kinds of Poetic Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="1">1. "In the earlie&s;t Periods of the Greek States, their
Ca&s;ual Strokes of Raillery were improved into written Invectives, and were
occa&s;ionally &s;ung by their &s;arca&s;tic Choirs." The&s;e written
Invectives were in Fact &s;o early, that all the Greek Writers with one Voice
confe&s;s them&s;elves altogether ignorant of their Origin. Their fir&s;t
Appearance is a&s;cribed by different Authors to different Nations<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See VOSSIUS <HI>In&s;t. Po&euml;t.</HI> l. ii. c.
23.</BIBL></NOTE>; and no Wonder if Evidence be wanting in Support of each
Pretence, when it is probable, that the&s;e &s;arca&s;tic Choirs aro&s;e in
many of the <HI>Greek</HI> States nearly at the &s;ame Time; that is, in or
about the fir&s;t Periods of Civilization and Letters. For we have &s;een, that
&s;uch a Period would naturally produce them: 
<Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e nothing could be more alluring to a
People of the &s;atyric Turn, than &s;uch a Repo&s;itory of Raillery and
Sarca&s;m."</Q> How|ever, we mu&s;t not omit to ob&s;erve, that their
Traditions are much more accommodated to Nature and Probability on this
Subject, than on the Ri&s;e of the tragic Choir, which they &s;eem generally to
have attributed to the &s;ingle Prac|tice of the drunken Votaries of
BACCHUS.</P>
<P N="2">2. "Narrative or Epic Poems of the invective or comic Kind
aro&s;e, and were occa&s;ionally &s;ung at their public Fe&s;tivals." For the
truth of this Fact we have the Te&s;timony of ARISTOTLE, who tells us, 
<Q REND="inline">"that although we know not the names either of
the&s;e Poems or their Authors; yet there is Rea&s;on to believe that many had
been written before HOMER; and that his <HI>Margites</HI> 
<PB N="143" REF="146" MS="y"> brought this Species to its Perfection in the
&s;ame Manner as the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> had compleated the
Form of the Epic Poem<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Po&euml;t.</HI> c.
4.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> That HOMER, as well as other Bards of the early Periods,
&s;ung their comic Poems at the fe&s;tal Solemnities, needs no farther Proof
here.</P>
<P N="3">3. "From the&s;e two Species (the <HI>Choral</HI> and
<HI>Narrative</HI> united) the fir&s;t rude Outline of Comedy aro&s;e." The
<HI>Narrative,</HI> already animated by a lively Action, did ea&s;ily &s;lide
into <HI>dramatic</HI> Repre&s;entation; and the corre&s;pondent Peals of
<HI>Laughter</HI> excited among the &s;urrounding Audience, by means of written
Invectives, a&s;&s;umed the Form of the <HI>comic Choir.</HI> In this Point, we
have again to contend with the general Body of Critics, from ARISTOTLE down to
the pre&s;ent Times, who all concur in a&s;cribing the Ri&s;e of the legitimate
Form of Comedy to HOMER's <HI>Margites</HI>; in the &s;ame Manner as they have
a&s;cribed the Ri&s;e of <HI>Tragedy</HI> to the <HI>Iliad</HI> and
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> But notwith|&s;tanding this general Concurrence of
Opinion, it &s;eems evident that the Progre&s;&s;ion of Comedy was founded in
the &s;ame Cau&s;es with that of Tragedy: That they both natu|rally aro&s;e in
the Cour&s;e of Things, from an Union of the <HI>Narration</HI> and the
<HI>Choir,</HI> without any Re&s;pect had to HO|MER's Poems. The &s;ame
Arguments that have proved the one, will confirm the other. We &s;ee the

le&s;s than tho&s;e of Tragedy<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect.

&s;hall find the fir&s;t rude Form of Comedy, ari&s;ing from an Union of
<HI>dramatic Repre&s;entation</HI> and a <HI>Choir,</HI> long before HOMER
exi&s;ted. In the Account <PB N="144" REF="147"> already cited from STRABO and

repre&s;ented his Victory, and &s;ung a Paean in Con&s;equence of it (in which
Union we &s;ee the fir&s;t rude Form of Tragedy) but likewi&s;e, in the Way of

<P N="6">6. "In the Republic of ATHENS, which was of more relaxed
Principles, where this Comedy had been tolerated, a general Corruption of
Manners took Place <PB N="146" REF="149"> among the People: The corrupt People
overpowered the Magi&s;trates; a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the Reins of
Government, and on this Foundation the old Comedy aro&s;e into Credit, had a
Choir appointed by the Magi|&s;trate, and was publicly e&s;tabli&s;hed." This
was the natural and nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of the Power of a corrupt
People. For the upright Magi&s;trates being de|po&s;ed, and the Creatures of
this corrupt People &s;eated in their Place, <HI>that</HI> Comedy was now
authorized by Law, which was mo&s;t accommodated to the Vices and Ta&s;te of a
di&s;&s;olute Populace.</P>
<P>The&s;e Cau&s;es clearly account for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the
old Comedy, at that very Period when it took Place. But as other Cau&s;es, void
of all Foundation, have been a&s;&s;igned for this, by various Authors; it will
be nece&s;&s;ary to prove the Truth of the Cau&s;es here alledged, from the
Authority of the Greek Writers.</P>
<P>PLATO, in the Pa&s;&s;age cited above<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Sect. v. Art. 34.</BIBL></NOTE>, gives us the Hi&s;tory
of the Corruption of the People, and of Mu&s;ic; but in &s;uch general Terms,
that, without &s;ome farther Evidence, it is impo&s;&s;ible clearly to fix the
Time when, or the Means by which, this Change was brought about, &s;o fatal to
the Republic of <HI>Athens.</HI> It happens fortunately, that PLUTARCH hath
recorded the Event with &s;uch Particularity of Circum&s;tance, as leaves no
Room to doubt on this Subject. PERICLES was the Man, who for his own private
Ends of Popularity, effected this ruinous Change: For 
<Q REND="inline">"By giving the People the Plunder and
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lands taken from the Enemy, and by

not only debauched the <HI>Athenian</HI> People; but that the Exhibition of

which His own Influence fir&s;t let in upon the State.</NOTE>.&mdash;The
concurrent Te&s;timony of XENOPHON clears the whole Affair; and gives as a full
View of the Con&s;equences of this general Corruption, &s;o far as the <HI>old
Comedy</HI> is concerned. For in his Di&s;cour&s;e on the <HI>Athe|nian</HI>

<Q REND="inline">"The Body of the People expelled All Good Men from

That

<P>The&s;e Evidences are &s;o clear and preci&s;e, as to leave no
Foundation of a Doubt on this Subject.</P>
<P>Lord SHAFTESBURY hath greatly mi&s;taken this Matter in his
<HI>Advice to an Author</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Characteri&s;tics,</HI> vol. i.</BIBL></NOTE>; and is as
carele&s;s or defec|tive here in the Circum&s;tance of Erudition, as at other
times in that of Rea&s;oning. He &s;eems in one Pa&s;&s;age to attri|bute the
late Cultivation and E&s;tabli&s;hment of the old Comedy to its being of more
<HI>difficult</HI> Compo&s;ition than Tragedy: 
<Q REND="inline">"In this Part (Tragedy) the Poets &s;ucceeded
&s;ooner than in Comedy, or the facetious Kind; as it was natural indeed to
&s;uppo&s;e, &s;ince this was in reality the ea&s;ie&s;t (ea&s;ier) Manner of
the two."</Q> This is deciding a doubtful Point by a mere Affirmation: For the
com|parative Difficulty of the&s;e two Kinds hath been treated at large by a
learned and mo&s;t judicious Writer, who after a candid and profound
Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the Que&s;tion, thinks it be&s;t to leave it undecided<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>BRUMOY <HI>Theatre des Grecs,</HI> tom.
vi.</BIBL>&mdash;This Que&s;tion hath indeed been &s;aid, by a learned Writer,
to admit of a <HI>deci&s;ive An&s;wer,</HI> on this Principle; that 
<Q REND="inline">"Tragedy, who&s;e End is the <HI>Pathos,</HI>
produces it by <HI>Action,</HI> while Comedy produces its End, the
<HI>Humorous,</HI> by <HI>Character.</HI> Now it is much more difficult to
<HI>paint Manners,</HI> than to <HI>plan Action</HI>; becau&s;e That requires
the <HI>Philo&s;opher's Knowledge</HI> of <HI>human Nature</HI>; this, only the
<HI>Hi&s;torian's Knowledge</HI> of <HI>human Events.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;But in
the Cour&s;e of this Argument, it &s;eems entirely forgot, that the tragic
Poet's Province is not only to <HI>plan,</HI> but to <HI>paint</HI> too. Had he
no farther Ta&s;k, than what depends on the mere <HI>Hi&s;torian's
Knowledge</HI> of <HI>human Events,</HI> the Rea&s;oning would hold. But as it
is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Effort of his Genius, in the
Con&s;truction of a <HI>compleat</HI> Tragedy, to <HI>invent</HI> and
<HI>order</HI> a <HI>pathetic</HI> Plan, <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> in all it's
Parts, and <HI>ri&s;ing</HI> towards it's <HI>Com|pletion</HI> by a
<HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> of Incidents which may <HI>keep up</HI> and continually
<HI>in|crea&s;e Terror</HI> or <HI>Pity</HI>; it is manife&s;t, that the
<HI>Perfection</HI> of his <HI>Plan</HI> depends not on his mere <HI>hi&s;toric
Knowledge</HI> of <HI>human Events,</HI> but on his <HI>philo&s;ophic
Di&s;cernment</HI> of <HI>human Pa&s;&s;ions</HI>; aided by a <HI>warm</HI> and
<HI>enlarged Invention:</HI> Talents as rare, at lea&s;t, as the
<HI>Knowledge</HI> or <HI>Di&s;cernment</HI> of <HI>human
Cha|racters.</HI>&mdash;If to this we add the &s;ub&s;equent Ta&s;k, of giving
the <HI>high Colourings</HI> of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> to the tragic
<HI>Plan</HI> thus <HI>ordered,</HI> the <HI>Difficulty</HI> of writing a
compleat <HI>Tragedy</HI> may &s;eem to be in &s;ome Re&s;pects <HI>equal,</HI>
in others <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to that of producing a compleat <HI>Comedy:</HI>
For in the <HI>Conduct</HI> of this la&s;t Species, it is acknowledged, that a
<HI>&s;mall Degree</HI> of <HI>poetic Invention</HI> will <HI>&s;upport</HI>
it.</NOTE>. The noble Writer, next, &s;eems to attribute the late Cultivation
of Comedy to 
<Q REND="inline">"the Spirit of literary Critici&s;m, which in the
Nature <PB N="149" REF="152"> of things could not ari&s;e, till it had
Materials to work on; and This he &s;uppo&s;eth to have been the <HI>fal&s;e
Sublime</HI> of their <HI>Tragedies,</HI> which were often <HI>parodied</HI> in
the <HI>old Comedy.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;But neither can this Cau&s;e be
&s;ufficient to account for the Effect; becau&s;e it appears that the be&s;t
Men, as well as the be&s;t Tragedies, were parodied or ridiculed more commonly
than the wor&s;t. Of this, the Fate of SOCRATES may &s;tand as a convincing
Proof. This Fact could not entirely e&s;cape the Notice of the noble Writer;
for he acknowledges, that 
<Q REND="inline">"even this <HI>Remedy</HI> it|&s;elf was found to
turn into a <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>P.
248.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> But we have already proved, that it was a Di&s;ea&s;e
even on its fir&s;t Appear|ance. In a Word, the Authorities given above, in
Support of the true Cau&s;es of the Cultivation and E&s;tabli&s;hment of the
old Greek Comedy at ATHENS, contain the cleare&s;t Proof that the noble
Writer's Deductions on this Subject are <HI>&s;pecious,</HI> but <HI>not
&s;olid</HI>; and that he di&s;covers but little of what he &s;eems to value
&s;o much, 
<Q REND="inline">"a Comprehen&s;ion of <PB N="150" REF="153"> ancient
Manners and ancient Hi&s;tory."</Q>&mdash;But, what is odd enough, after having
&s;eparately a&s;&s;igned the&s;e ficti|tious Cau&s;es as being each the
Foundation on which the old Comedy aro&s;e and was e&s;tabli&s;hed, He at
length glances accidentally upon the true one: Yet manife&s;tly without any
particular Knowledge of the Facts which &s;upport it. 
<Q REND="inline">"According to this <HI>Homerical</HI> Lineage of
Poetry, <HI>Comedy</HI> would naturally prove the <HI>Drama</HI> of
<HI>late&s;t Birth.</HI> For though ARISTOTLE cites HOMER's <HI>Margites</HI>
as analo|gous to <HI>Comedy,</HI> yet the <HI>Iliad</HI> and
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> in which the heroic Style prevails, having been ever
<HI>highe&s;t in E&s;teem,</HI> were likelie&s;t to be <HI>fir&s;t wrought and
cultivated</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Characteri&s;tics,</HI> vol.
i. p. 253. Notes.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> We may conclude, then, upon the Authority
of the three great Ancients cited above, that 
<Q REND="inline">"the Cultivation and <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> of
the old <HI>Greek Comedy</HI> aro&s;e from the united <HI>Corruption</HI> and
<HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Peo|ple."</Q></P>
<P N="7">7. "The Ridicule and Invective of their Comedy, thus
e&s;tabli&s;hed, was pointed chiefly again&s;t tho&s;e Magi&s;trates or private
Men, who&s;e Qualities were hateful to the debauched Populace." For the Proof
of this, the Read|er is referred to the Pa&s;&s;ages already cited from PLATO,
and XENOPHON: And on this Solution, the Fate of SO|CRATES is clearly accounted
for. Nor could any thing be more natural, if the Cau&s;es here a&s;&s;igned for
the E&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the old Comedy be true. 
<Q REND="inline">"For Corruption being now e&s;tabli&s;hed, as it
were, by Law: that is, by the Voice of a degenerate People, which &s;tood in
the Place of Law; the Poets found it nece&s;&s;ary to gratify the People's
Vices, as the &s;ure&s;t Road to Succe&s;s; and <PB N="151" REF="154"> the only
Road to this, was now by the <HI>Ridicule</HI> of <HI>Virtue.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P N="8">8. "A Tyranny &s;uddenly erected it&s;elf on the Ruins of the
corrupt <HI>Athenian</HI> People, and at once &s;ilenced this Species of
Comedy." This Event happened on the taking of ATHENS by LYSANDER; and thro' the
Authority of the thirty Tyrants whom he e&s;tabli&s;hed there. The&s;e
<HI>Op|pre&s;&s;ors</HI> did That from <HI>Fear,</HI> which <HI>upright</HI>
Magi&s;trates would have done from <HI>Virtue.</HI> The plain Rea&s;on hath
been a&s;&s;igned above: 
<Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e every thing hateful to the People being
now the e&s;tabli&s;hed Subject of the comic Mu&s;e, the Tyrants who had
de&s;troyed the public Liberty, mu&s;t expect to become the Subject of Comedy,
if permitted to revel in its former Licentiou&s;ne&s;s."</Q> Here again the
noble Author of the Characteri&s;tics &s;eems to a&s;&s;ign a fictitious
Cau&s;e for this Event, drawn from his own Conjectures, in&s;tead of Hi&s;tory.

<Q REND="inline">"Nothing could have been the Cau&s;e of this gradual
Reform in the Commonwealth of Wit, be&s;ide the real Reform of Ta&s;te and
Humour in the Commonwealth or Government it&s;elf."</Q>&mdash;For, &s;aith he, 
<Q REND="inline">"it <HI>little concerned</HI> the <HI>Foreigners in
Power</HI> (the thirty Tyrants) after what Manner tho&s;e <HI>Citizens</HI>
treated <HI>one another</HI> in their <HI>Comedies</HI>; or what &s;ort of Wit
or Humour they made Choice of, for their ordinary Diver&s;ions<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Characteri&s;tics,</HI> vol. i. p.
250.249.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> It can hardly be nece&s;&s;ary to point out, in
what Circum&s;tance this Rea&s;oning is defective. Had the private Citizens
buffooned <HI>each other only</HI> in their <HI>Comedies,</HI> the <HI>Thirty
Tyrants</HI> would indeed have had little to fear: But as it is evident, that
the <HI>public Magi&s;trates,</HI> and their <HI>Conduct,</HI> had been the
&s;tanding <PB N="152" REF="155"> Objects of theatrical Ridicule, it certainly
<HI>much concerned</HI> the&s;e <HI>Foreigners in Power,</HI> to prevent that
&s;arca&s;tic Repre|&s;entation of their oppre&s;&s;ive Government, which they
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily expect from the keen Spirit of an exa&s;perated and
licentious People. The noble Writer endeavours to confirm his Opinion by a
parallel In&s;tance drawn from the <HI>Roman</HI> Commonwealth; where a
&s;imilar Prohibition took Place with regard to the <HI>Atellane</HI> Fables,
at a Time, when no Effects of foreign 
<Q REND="inline">"Power, or of a home Ty|ranny can be pretended<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>P. 251.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> But this In&s;tance,
joyned to the Evidences already given on the Subject, in&s;tead of confirming,
overturns his Sy&s;tem: It only proves what was alledged above, that the
<HI>Athenian Tyrants</HI> did that from <HI>Fear,</HI> which the <HI>Roman
Magi&s;trates</HI> did from <HI>Virtue.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. "The Poets found a Subterfuge, for the Gratification of the
People; and continued to repre&s;ent real Cha|racters under feigned Names."
Thus the <HI>middle Co|medy</HI> was naturally e&s;tabli&s;hed. For this was
the only Species which they could now pur&s;ue with any Proba|bility of
<HI>Succe&s;s:</HI> And this was continued without much <HI>Danger,</HI> as we
find they were cautious with Re&s;pect to the Per&s;ons of the
Tyrants.&mdash;That &s;uch was the true Origin of this Change in the Character
of the Greek Comedy, appears farther from the two following Con|&s;iderations.
Fir&s;t, there is not the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to be|lieve the Athenian People were
at all changed from their coar&s;e Manners and profligate Character, at the
Time when the old Comedy was &s;ilenced: And &s;econdly, by the Accounts left
concerning the Genius of the <HI>mid|dle Comedy,</HI> it appears, that it was
in all Re&s;pects as <PB N="153" REF="156" MS="y"> illiberal and buffooning, in
its Beginnings as the old Comedy had been; the &s;ingle Circum&s;tance of
<HI>nominal De&s;ignation</HI> only accepted.</P>
<P N="10">10. "A great <HI>Conqueror</HI> aro&s;e: And, by &s;ubduing a
Variety of Nations, opened a <HI>Communication</HI> between the Commonwealth of
ATHENS, and the <HI>ea&s;tern</HI> King|doms which were of more
<HI>luxurious</HI> and <HI>refined</HI> Man|ners: On this Event, the
<HI>&s;econd</HI> or <HI>middle</HI> Species of <HI>Comedy</HI> naturally
received a <HI>Poli&s;h</HI>; and, laying a&s;ide the indirect per&s;onal
Invective, a&s;&s;umed the more delicate Form of general Raillery; and became a
Picture of human Life." The learned Reader will ea&s;ily &s;ee, that ALEXANDER
<HI>the Great</HI> is the Conqueror here alluded to: in his Reign it was, and
not till that late Period, that the <HI>middle</HI> Comedy was poli&s;hed into
the <HI>new.</HI> This was the natural Effect of that Politene&s;s, which was
introduced at ATHENS by a frequent and familiar Commerce with the effeminate
Nations of the Ea&s;t. Till then, although the <HI>Athenians</HI> ju&s;tly
boa&s;ted a Superiority in the <HI>Arts,</HI> yet in their Conver&s;e and
Treatment of each other, the concurrent Authority of ancient Hi&s;torians, as
well as the more certain Te&s;timony of their own remaining Comedies,
a&s;&s;ure us, that they were of an <HI>illiberal</HI> and <HI>buffooning</HI>
Turn. But no &s;ooner were the <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> Luxuries and Re|finements
brought to ATHENS, by the Conque&s;ts of ALEXANDER, than their coar&s;e Manners
melted gradually into fal&s;e Politene&s;s and Effeminacy. Now, 
<Q REND="inline">"one of the fir&s;t Effects of a growing
Politene&s;s, is to avoid all Occa&s;ions of Offence; and this, without
Re&s;pect to any Con&s;equences, either good or bad, which may affect 
<PB N="154" REF="157" MS="y"> the Public; but merely from a &s;elfi&s;h Regard
to the Opinion of <HI>Elegance,</HI> and the Pride of
<HI>Urbanity.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>This Rea&s;oning coincides in all Re&s;pects with the la&s;t
Progre&s;&s;ion of Comedy at ATHENS: And tho&s;e Writers, as Lord SHAFTESBURY
and the Author of the Life of HOMER, who have attempted to re&s;olve the
E&s;tabli&s;hment of the new Comedy into a <HI>Reform</HI> or
<HI>Improvement</HI> of Manners, in a <HI>virtuous</HI> Sen&s;e, have
mi&s;taken <HI>Shadows</HI> for <HI>Realities,</HI> and confounded
<HI>Decency</HI> with <HI>Virtue.</HI> For it is certain, that both private and
public Virtue were at the lowe&s;t Ebb, while Comedy was a&s;&s;uming its
<HI>new</HI> and fini&s;hed Form. This we are a&s;&s;ured of by the concurrent
Te&s;timony of PLUTARCH, JUSTIN, and other ancient Writers: Even &s;o far were
the <HI>Athenians</HI> from regarding the public Welfare or Defence of their
Country, that it was made a capital Crime for any Man to propo&s;e the
Re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of their Militia, or the Application of the public Funds
to its Maintenance<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LIBANIUS <HI>Arg. ad</HI>
OLYNTH. I.</BIBL></NOTE>. Their Vices there|fore were not
<HI>le&s;&s;ening,</HI> but <HI>refining:</HI> And the Idea of <HI>Decency</HI>
was &s;liding in, to &s;upplant the rougher Appearances of <HI>Virtue.</HI> We
know a neighbour Nation, in which parallel Effects prevail: a Nation who are
too generally 
<Q REND="inline">"licentious in private Morals, though in public
Conduct decent:"</Q> And it is remarkable, that from this Refine|ment in Vices,
a Species of Manners and of Comedy <HI>there</HI> prevails, altogether
&s;imilar to tho&s;e of the later <HI>Greeks.</HI> For while their private
Conver&s;ation abounds with <HI>Irre|ligion, Immorality,</HI> and
<HI>Ob&s;cenity,</HI> nothing is admitted on their Stage, but what is
con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Piety, good Morals,</HI> and <HI>good

<P>THUS we have traced the Progre&s;&s;ion of the ancient
<HI>Greek</HI> MUSIC in all its Branches, through the various Stages of their
Union and Power, down to their final Separation and Corruption in the later
Periods. As a Confirmation of the e&s;&s;ential Principles offered in this
Di&s;cour&s;e, let us now con&s;ider this natural Union and Progre&s;&s;ion, as
it hath appeared in other Nations, where the&s;e Arts never arrived at &s;o
compleat a Form; where the Progre&s;&s;ion cea&s;ed before any high Degree of
Per|fection came on, either through a Want of improving Lite|rature, or by
other Ob&s;tructions from internal or external Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The neare&s;t Approach we can make to the &s;avage State, in any
In&s;tance drawn from the Records of Antiquity, &s;eems to be found in the
Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Curetes,</HI> or <HI>Cory|bantes</HI> of the I&s;land of
CRETE. STRABO and DIODORUS, who give us their Hi&s;tory, de&s;cribe them as
barbarous Tribes of Men, living among Caves and Mountains, at once
<HI>Warriors, Prie&s;ts, Poets,</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;icians</HI>; who cele|brated
their public Fe&s;tivals with enthu&s;ia&s;tic and clamor|ous Mu&s;ic, Song,
and Dance, accompanied with Drums, Cymbals, and other noi&s;y In&s;truments,
almo&s;t in the very Manner of the &s;avage Iroquois<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>STRABO, l. x. DIODORUS, l. v.</BIBL></NOTE>. RHADAMAN|THUS
fir&s;t, and then MINOS, civilized this barbarous Route; and regulated their
Manners and their Mu&s;ic, on <PB N="156" REF="159"> the Model of the &s;evere
<HI>Egyptian</HI> Legi&s;lation. After MINOS, THALES aro&s;e: In whom we find
the united Characters of Legi&s;lator and Mu&s;ician: He compo&s;ed Laws, for
the <HI>Cretan</HI> State, and &s;ung them to his Lyre<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">As THALES &s;ucceeded RHADAMANTHUS and MINOS, who had
<HI>both</HI> copied the EGYPTIAN Forms of Legi&s;lation; his compo&s;ing
<HI>Laws</HI> in <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> could only be the Effect of mere
<HI>Imitation.</HI></NOTE>. But Mu&s;ic being fixed to certain Forms by Law, we
are not to wonder that its Progre&s;&s;ion &s;topped, as at SPARTA; which
Commonwealth was modelled on the rigorous E&s;ta|bli&s;hment of CRETE.</P>
<P>With Re&s;pect to EGYPT, the Beginnings of that famous Kingdom are
&s;o lo&s;t in its Antiquity, that we know no|thing of the fir&s;t Advances
there made in <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> from its original Savage State. We only read,
that in &s;ome early Period of Civilization its Forms were unalterably fixed by
Law, and therefore all <HI>Improvement</HI> and <HI>Corruption</HI> alike
<HI>prevented.</HI></P>
<P>As to the more <HI>northern</HI> Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> it is
re|markable, that we know little of them from ancient Hi&s;|tory till the
&s;econd Period of Mu&s;ic commenced, that is, till the <HI>Legi&s;lator's</HI>
Character had been <HI>&s;eparated</HI> from that of the <HI>Mu&s;ician.</HI>
The cleare&s;t In&s;tance of the Union of the <HI>Legi&s;lator's</HI> and
<HI>Bard's</HI> Character is found in SNORRO STURLOSON, who, about five Hundred
and fifty Years ago, was at once the chief <HI>Legi&s;lator</HI> and mo&s;t
eminent <HI>Bard</HI> in the I&s;le of ICELAND<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Preface to NICHOLSON's <HI>Iri&s;h Hi&s;t.
Library.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. In the &s;econd Period, we meet with the poetic
and mu&s;ical Character united in almo&s;t every northern Clime, under the
revered Denomi|nation of <HI>Scaldi</HI> or <HI>Bards.</HI> It hath been
already ob&s;erved, that ODIN the <HI>Scythian</HI> Legi&s;lator, boa&s;ted
that the <HI>Runic</HI> <PB N="157" REF="160"> Songs had heen given him by the
Gods<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect. v.</BIBL></NOTE>. A
Circum|&s;tance which proves, that the Character of <HI>Heroe</HI> and
<HI>Mu&s;ician</HI> had been united in the Chiefs of that fierce and &s;avage
People, in the Period which immediately preceded him. We learn from SHERINGHAM
and BARTHOLINE, that after the fir&s;t Separation had been made, the
<HI>Scaldi, Mu&s;icians,</HI> or <HI>Bards,</HI> were a Race of Men highly
honoured among the <HI>Scythian</HI> or <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Tribes: That their
Songs were of the <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> Ca&s;t; that they &s;ung the great
Actions of their Ance&s;tors, were them&s;elves renowned War|riors, and kindled
the Valour of their Armies by their Songs: That none were admitted of the
Order, but tho&s;e of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Families<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>SHERINGHAM <HI>de Angl. Orig.</HI> p. 173.</BIBL></NOTE>:

<P>We meet with the <HI>Gauli&s;h Bards</HI> under the &s;ame Period of
Separation: But their Spirit &s;eems to have been con|trouled by a more
<HI>peaceable</HI> Species of Legi&s;lation. For STRABO tells us, that 
<Q REND="inline">"throughout the whole Di&s;trict of GAUL, there are
three Kinds of Men, who are held in &s;ingular Honour: The <HI>Bards,</HI> the
<HI>Vates,</HI> and the <HI>Druids:</HI> The <HI>Bards</HI> are <HI>Poets,</HI>
and <HI>&s;ing</HI> their Hymns: The <HI>Vates</HI> perform <HI>Sacrifice,</HI>
and <HI>contemplate</HI> the Nature of Things: The <HI>Druids,</HI> be&s;ides
this, hold Di&s;cour&s;es on <HI>Morals.</HI> They are e&s;teemed the
ju&s;te&s;t of Men; and therefore are intru&s;ted with the Determination of all
Differences, public and private; and &s;ometimes peace|ably end a Quarrel, when

<PB N="158" REF="161"> DIODORUS is &s;till more particular; and proves, that

Power, amid&s;t the Mountains and Poverty of that barren Region. He was &s;o
highly exa&s;perated by the Influence of their Songs, which breathed the Spirit
of Liberty and War, and retarded his Conque&s;t over a hardy People, that he
ba&s;ely ordered them to be &s;lain: An Event, which hath lately given Birth to
an elegant and &s;ublime Strain of Poetry<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>An Ode,
by Mr. GRAY.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the Genius of tho&s;e <HI>Briti&s;h Bards</HI> who inhabited the
northern Di&s;tricts of the I&s;land, we have a noble Proof in the Poems lately
publi&s;hed under the Name of OSSIAN. The&s;e appear to have been compo&s;ed
and &s;ung, during the &s;econd Period of Mu&s;ic; that is, when the Bard's
Pro|fe&s;&s;ion <PB N="159" REF="162"> had &s;eparated from that of the
Legi&s;lator, yet &s;till retained its Power and Dignity in full Union. For
OSSIAN, the declared Author of the Poems, was the Son of the royal FINGAL,
accompanied him in his Wars, and &s;ung his Atchievements to the Harp. The&s;e
Poems give a noble Confirmation to many of the Principles ad|vanced in this
Analy&s;is. They are of various Forms; though none of them properly unmixed.
The <HI>Song,</HI> in the Days of this &s;ublime and original Bard, appears
evi|dently to have worn the <HI>inartificial</HI> and <HI>mixed</HI> Forms of
Compo&s;ition, which we have found generally and of Cour&s;e to prevail in the
early Periods. Thus, FINGAL is chiefly <HI>Epic</HI>; yet the <HI>hymnal</HI>
Species abounds in it: Others are <HI>dramatic</HI>; yet in the&s;e, the
<HI>narrative</HI> often takes Place: Others, again, are in the Form of
<HI>Odes</HI>; yet even the&s;e are &s;trongly mixed and marked with the
<HI>Epic</HI> and <HI>dramatic</HI> Manner<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">As the&s;e
Circum&s;tances are internal Proofs of the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of the Poems;
&s;o there are other collateral Evidences of the &s;ame Nature, which &s;eem
clearly to confirm it. Such are the grand Simplicity of Imagery and Diction,
the &s;trong Draughts of rude Manners and uncultivated Scenes of Nature, which
abound in all the&s;e Poems; Pictures, which no civilized Modern could ever
imbibe in their Strength, nor con&s;equently could ever throw out. Such, again,
are the frequent Allu&s;ions (wrought into the very E&s;&s;ence of the Poems)
to the Principles of the old <HI>Celtic</HI> Religion, which in ancient times
had over&s;pread the&s;e Kingdoms: Of this Nature is That which the
Tran&s;lator calls the <HI>mo&s;t extravagant Fiction</HI> in all OSSIAN's
Poems; I mean, the Battle between FINGAL, and the Gho&s;t or Spirit of
LODA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Carric-Thura:</HI> A
Poem.</BIBL></NOTE>: Now this, though it carries the Appearance of
Extravagance, and ill-judged Improbability, yet, upon a nearer View, will be
&s;ound to contain an internal Evidence of the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of the Poem;
as it is drawn from the very E&s;&s;ence of the old <HI>Celtic</HI> Belief.
Thus &s;peaks the learned BARTHOLINE:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Summa Audacia credebatur Lucta cum Spectris non
formidata<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Contemptu Mortis apud
Danes,</HI> l. ii. c. 2.</BIBL></NOTE>." "It was e&s;teemed the highe&s;t Act
of Courage, to dare to encounter a Gho&s;t."</Q>&mdash;But it mu&s;t be
ob|&s;erved, that the Spirit of their chief God ODIN was an Exception to this
Rule: The Living and the Dead were all deemed &s;ubject to his Controule
therefore, the Spirit of LODA was not the Spirit of ODIN, but of &s;ome
inferior Deity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The natural Flame of &s;avage Mu&s;ic and Poetry is now almo&s;t
entirely quenched in the &s;everal Parts of this I&s;land: 
<PB N="160" REF="163"> In <HI>England,</HI> it lo&s;t its Power by the
Migration of the native <HI>Britons</HI> into WALES: In Wales, it was quenched
by the Cruelty of EDWARD: In the Highlands of SCOT|LAND, the Writer is well
informed, that the Bard's Pro|fe&s;&s;ion was upheld in &s;ome Degree of
Honour, till near the Beginning of this Century. About which Time, the
Communication of the Inhabitants with the more civilized Parts of the Kingdom
by Degrees a&s;&s;imilated their Man|ners to tho&s;e of their Neighbours; by
which means the Profe&s;&s;ion became extinct<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">About the

<P>The Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Iri&s;h Bards</HI> is perhaps of all others
the mo&s;t extraordinary; and will therefore de&s;erve a par|ticular Regard.

<HI>Legi&s;lator's</HI> and <HI>Bard's</HI> Cha|racter are united in the &s;ame
Per&s;on. But of the &s;econd Period we have large Accounts in the
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torians. For we are informed, there were three principal
Tribes among the ancient <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"The Fir&s;t were <HI>Leaders, Chiefs,</HI> or
<HI>Legi&s;lators:</HI> The Second were <HI>Druids</HI> or
<HI>Prie&s;ts:</HI>"</Q> The Third were <HI>Bards.</HI> The two la&s;t were 
<PB N="161" REF="164" MS="y"> honoured with an Appellation equivalent to the
Name of <HI>Gods</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>KEATING's <HI>Hi&s;t.</HI>
of IRELAND, p. 48.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bards</HI> had e&s;tates &s;ettled on them, that they might
be free from worldly Cares: They lived in perfect In|dependence, and were
obliged to no Service: Their Per|&s;ons were inviolable: To kill them, was
e&s;teemed the blacke&s;t Crime; and it was held an Act of Sacrilege to &s;eize
their E&s;tates, even for the public Service, and in Times of the greate&s;t
Di&s;tre&s;s<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ib. p. 132.
&amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Profe&s;&s;ion was hereditary: But when the <HI>Bard</HI> died,
his E&s;tate de&s;cended not to his elde&s;t Son, but to the mo&s;t
accompli&s;hed of his Family in the mu&s;ical Profe&s;&s;ion. A Law was made by
OLLAMH FODHLA, one of their greate&s;t Kings, that none &s;hould be inve&s;ted
with the Dignity of a <HI>Bard,</HI> but tho&s;e of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious
Families<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bards,</HI> the <HI>Druids,</HI> and <HI>Nobility,</HI> were
&s;ummoned by the &s;ame King, to a <HI>triennial Fe&s;tival,</HI> which was
thus by him e&s;tabli&s;hed, to tran&s;mit to Po&s;terity the <HI>Authentic
Songs</HI> of the <HI>Bards,</HI> as the Materials of their future
Hi&s;|tories. In Con&s;equence of this, the approved Songs of the ancient Bards
were pre&s;erved in the Cu&s;tody of the King's Antiquary; and are appealed to
by KEATING, as the Foundation of his Hi&s;tory<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ib. p. 132. &amp; Preface, p. 23.</BIBL></NOTE>. Many of
them were fabulous; but this Circum&s;tance hath no e&s;&s;ential Relation to
our pre&s;ent Inquiry.</P>
<P>Garments of different Colour were appropriated to the various Ranks
of the Kingdom: So high was the Power <PB N="162" REF="165"> and Dignity of the
<HI>Bards,</HI> that they wore the <HI>&s;ame Colour</HI> with the <HI>royal
Family</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>KEATING's <HI>Hi&s;t.</HI> of
IRELAND, p. 127.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus inve&s;ted with Honours, Wealth, and Power; and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an Art which gave them a natural Influence over the Minds
of the People; we find, that about the year 558, they had become in&s;olent,
deeply corrupted, and dangerous. Hence, the reigning King convened a general
Council of the Nobility and Gentry (for Chri&s;ti|anity being now planted in
IRELAND, the <HI>Druids</HI> were no more) with Intention to expel them the
I&s;land. They were now become a Kind of <HI>&s;acred Order,</HI> or
<HI>College</HI>; which was grow &s;o numerous, that one third of the Kingdom
is &s;aid to have ranked them&s;elves in this Cla&s;s, as a &s;afe A&s;ylum for
Idlene&s;s and Hypocri&s;y. When the <HI>Principal Bards</HI> a&s;&s;embled in
a Body to divert this im|pending Storm, they met, to the Number of a
<HI>Thou&s;and.</HI> This may account for the Numbers that claimed to be of the
Profe&s;&s;ion; for every <HI>Principal Bard</HI> retained <HI>thirty</HI> of
inferior Note, as his Attendants; and a <HI>Bard</HI> of the <HI>&s;econd</HI>
Order was followed by a Retinue of <HI>fifteen.</HI> In this Convention, after
many Debates, it was re&s;olved that they &s;hould leave the I&s;land, and
retire into SCOTLAND, be|fore the Sentence of their Bani&s;hment was
pronounced.&mdash;However, the Sentence was mitigated: They were al|lowed to
di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves over the I&s;land, and promi&s;ed to live in a Manner
le&s;s offen&s;ive to the Public<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ib. 370,
&amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a &s;ucceeding, and no very di&s;tant Period, we find them again
grown trouble&s;ome to the Kings, who com|plained <PB N="163" REF="166" MS="y">
of them, as a Burthen to the People, lazy, covet|ous, and in&s;atiable. On
this, their Number was le&s;&s;ened and regulated: By the Advice of St. COLUM
CILL, every provincial <HI>Chief</HI> had <HI>one</HI> learned <HI>Bard</HI>
allowed him in his Retinue, to <HI>record</HI> the <HI>Atchievements</HI> of
his Family: Their Independance, with a competent Revenue, was pre&s;erved: And
this Regulation was the Standard, by which the Society of Bards were directed
in &s;ucceeding Ages<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>KEATING's <HI>Hi&s;t.</HI>
of IRELAND, p. 380, 381.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Tis to be ob&s;erved, that in &s;ome unrecorded Period, a
<HI>Separation</HI> had taken Place in the <HI>Bard's</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion: In
the early Times, the Offices of <HI>Poet</HI> and <HI>Lyri&s;t</HI> were united
in the &s;ame Per&s;on: In the later Ages, it appears, that the <HI>Bard</HI>
only compo&s;ed the <HI>Poem</HI>; and that it was <HI>&s;ung</HI> by a
<HI>Rhap&s;odi&s;t</HI> or <HI>Harper</HI> at the public Fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>However, we find that on the Extinction of Learn|ing, and Increa&s;e
of Barbari&s;m in this Kingdom, the native Vigour of the poetic Stock again
&s;hot up in a &s;ucceeding Age; and for Want of a proper Culture, was again
become one of the ruling Evils of the Coun|try, in the Time of SPENSER; Who
gives the follow|ing animated De&s;cription of their <HI>Songs</HI> and
<HI>Cha|racter:</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"There is among&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> a certain
Kind of People called <HI>Bardes,</HI> which are to them in&s;tead of
<HI>Poets,</HI> who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion is to &s;et forth the <HI>Prai&s;es</HI>
or <HI>Di&s;prai&s;es</HI> of Men in their Poems or Rythmes; the which are had
in &s;o high Regard and E&s;timation among&s;t them, that none dare
di&s;plea&s;e them for Fear to run into Reproach through their Offence, and to
be made <PB N="164" REF="167"> infamous in the Mouths of all Men. For their
Ver&s;es are taken up with a general Applau&s;e, and u&s;ually <HI>&s;ung</HI>
at all <HI>Fea&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Meetings</HI> by certain <HI>other
Per&s;ons,</HI> who&s;e proper Function that is, who al&s;o receive for the
&s;ame great Rewards and Reputation among&s;t them."&mdash;"The&s;e <HI>Iri&s;h
Bardes</HI> are for the mo&s;t Part &s;o far from in&s;tructing young Men in
<HI>moral</HI> Di&s;cipline, that they them&s;elves do more de&s;erve to be
&s;harply di&s;ciplined: For they &s;eldom u&s;e to choo&s;e unto them&s;elves
the Doings of <HI>good</HI> Men for the Arguments of their Poems; but
whom&s;oever they find to be mo&s;t <HI>licentious</HI> of Life, mo&s;t
<HI>bold</HI> and <HI>lawle&s;s</HI> in his Doings, mo&s;t <HI>danger|ous</HI>
and <HI>de&s;perate</HI> in all Parts of Di&s;obedience and rebel|lious
Di&s;po&s;ition; Him they <HI>&s;et up</HI> and <HI>glorify</HI> in their
<HI>Rythmes,</HI> Him they <HI>prai&s;e</HI> to the <HI>People,</HI> and to
<HI>young</HI> Men make an <HI>Example</HI> to follow."&mdash;Thus "evil things
being decked and attired with the gay Attire of goodly Words, may ea&s;ily
deceive and carry away the Affection of a young Mind that is not well &s;tayed,
but de&s;irous by &s;ome bold Adventures to make Proof of him&s;elf. For being
(as they all be) brought up idely without Awe of Parents, without Precepts of
Ma&s;ters, and without Fear of Offence; not being directed, nor employed in any
Cour&s;e of Life which may carry them to Virtue; will ea&s;ily be drawn to
follow &s;uch as any &s;hall &s;et before them: For a young Mind cannot re&s;t:
If he be not &s;till bu&s;ied in &s;ome Goodne&s;s, he will find him&s;elf
&s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s, as &s;hall &s;oon bu&s;y all about him. In which, if he
&s;hall find any to prai&s;e him, and to give him Encouragement, as tho&s;e
<HI>Bardes</HI> and <HI>Rythmers</HI> do for little Reward, or a Share of a
<HI>&s;toln Cow,</HI> then <PB N="165" REF="168" MS="y"> waxeth he mo&s;t
in&s;olent and half mad with the Love of him&s;elf, and his own lewd Deeds. And
as for Words to &s;et off &s;uch Lewdne&s;s, it is not hard for them to give a
goodly and painted &s;hew thereunto, borrowed even from the Prai&s;es which are
proper to Virtue it&s;elf: As of a mo&s;t notorious <HI>Thief</HI> and wicked
<HI>Outlaw,</HI> which had lived all his Life Time of <HI>Spoils</HI> and
<HI>Robberies,</HI> one of their <HI>Bardes</HI> in his Prai&s;e will &s;ay,
that he was none of the idle <HI>Milk-Sops</HI> that was brought up by the
<HI>Fire-&s;ide</HI>; but that mo&s;t of his Days he &s;pent in <HI>Arms</HI>
and valiant <HI>Enterpri&s;es:</HI> That he did never eat his Meat, before he
had won it with his Sword: That he lay not all Night &s;lugging in a Cabin
under his Mantle; but u&s;ed commonly to keep others waking to defend their
Lives; and did light his Candle at the Flames of their Hou&s;es, to lead him in
the Darkne&s;s: That the Day was his Night, and the Night his Day: That he
loved not to be long wooing of Wenches to yield to him; but where he came, he
took by Force the Spoil of other Men's Love, and left but Lamentation to their
Lovers: That his Mu&s;ic was not the Harp, nor Lays of Love, but the Cries of
People, and the cla&s;hing of Armour: And finally, that he died, not bewailed
of many, but made many wail when he died, that dearly bought his
Death."&mdash;"I have cau&s;ed divers of the&s;e Poems to be tran&s;lated unto
me, that I might under|&s;tand them: And &s;urely, they &s;avoured of
<HI>&s;weet Wit</HI> and <HI>good Invention</HI>; but <HI>&s;killed not</HI> of

<P>With Re&s;pect to the Extent of the <HI>Progre&s;&s;ion</HI> of
Mu&s;ic in this va&s;t Empire; it appears, that they have no mu&s;ical
Notation; that Compo&s;ition in <HI>Parts</HI> is altogether un|known; and that
the whole <HI>Choir</HI> &s;ings the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Melody: That their Mu&s;ic

Whence &s;ome of the Hi&s;torians &s;eem to gue&s;s that it hath degenerated;
while in reality, no other Con&s;equence can be ju&s;tly drawn, but that either
the People are le&s;s <HI>ignorant</HI> and <HI>barbarous</HI>; or that Mu&s;ic

Force.</P>
<P>It appears, however, that the Progre&s;&s;ion had advanced &s;o far
in &s;ome former Period, prior to CONFUCIUS, as to produce <HI>dramatic
Repre&s;entation,</HI> mixed with <HI>Song:</HI> And <PB N="169" REF="172"> in
Conformity, to the Principles given above, we find, that as they regard not the
<HI>Unities</HI> of Action, Place, or Time, &s;o neither is any <HI>continued
Choir</HI> in u&s;e; though there be manife&s;t Remains of it in their
<HI>Plays:</HI> For at the Conclu&s;ion of Scenes or Acts, as well as at other
Times when a <HI>pathetic</HI> Circum&s;tance occurs, the Per&s;ons of the
Play, in&s;tead of <HI>declaiming,</HI> begin to <HI>&s;ing.</HI> The
<HI>Prologue</HI> re&s;embles that uncouth one of GREECE, that is, he tells you
<HI>who</HI> he is, and <HI>what</HI> is his <HI>Errand.</HI> All their Plays
have a <HI>moral</HI> or <HI>political</HI> Direction, &s;uited to the Genius
of the People and the State. They know not the Difference between
<HI>Tragedy</HI> and <HI>Comedy</HI>; another Circum&s;tance which confirms the
Principle given above, concerning the true Ri&s;e and Di&s;tinction of the&s;e
two Kinds in GREECE: For the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> as they have ever been of a
<HI>timid</HI> and <HI>peaceable</HI> Cha|racter, &s;o neither are they given
to <HI>Raillery</HI> or <HI>Sarca&s;m,</HI> but al|together to
<HI>Civility</HI> and mutual <HI>Re&s;pect.</HI> Hence, neither the
<HI>Tragic</HI> nor <HI>comic</HI> Drama could probably ari&s;e, &s;o as to be
marked as a <HI>di&s;tinct Species.</HI> Accordingly, their <HI>Plays</HI> are
generally of an <HI>intermediate</HI> Ca&s;t, between <HI>Terror</HI> and
<HI>Pity</HI> on the one Hand, <HI>Sarca&s;m</HI> or <HI>Ridicule</HI> on the
other. The "<HI>little Orphan</HI> of CHINA," indeed, which is given as a
Specimen by DU HALDE, borders on the <HI>tragic</HI> Species: But this Play is
but one of a hundred, mo&s;t of which are of a different Ca&s;t; and was
&s;elected by him, becau&s;e he thought it the be&s;t adapted in its Genius, to
the Spirit and Ta&s;te of the <HI>Europeans:</HI> For he tells us expre&s;ly,
that the general Character of their Plays are altogether different from this;
that they are commonly of a <HI>middle</HI> Kind, and neither <HI>Tragedy</HI>
nor <HI>Comedy.</HI> Another Circum&s;tance of the Progre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be
marked; which <PB N="170" REF="173"> is, that their <HI>Actors</HI> are a
<HI>&s;eparate</HI> Rank from their <HI>Poets</HI>; that they are formed into
<HI>Companies,</HI> and have lo&s;t their original Dignity of Office and
Character.</P>
<P>In the ancient Kingdom of PERU, the Progre&s;&s;ion of
<HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> had reached the &s;ame Period, though &s;omewhat different in
its Circum&s;tances. GARCILASSO DE LA VEGA informs us, that their fabulous
Songs were in|numerable; that he had heard many, and learnt &s;ome of them,
from his Ance&s;tors, who were the la&s;t of the royal Family of the INCAS.
They were of various Kinds, founded on a Variety of Pa&s;&s;ion, religious,
warlike, and amorous. They had invented a Kind of <HI>unequal Pipe,</HI> formed
of Reeds of different Lengths, preci&s;ely the &s;ame with that of ancient
GREECE. They had al&s;o a Species of Flute, with four or five Stops: Their
Mu&s;ic was &s;imple, like that of all unpoli&s;hed Countries. Their INCAS or
<HI>Chiefs</HI> had been <HI>Poets</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;icians</HI> in the early
Periods; and the Author of the Commentaries gives a Poem com|po&s;ed by one of
them, which bears all the Marks of a &s;pirited and &s;avage Original. They had
their <HI>dramatic</HI> Re|pre&s;entations, in Part <HI>re&s;embling,</HI> and
in Part <HI>differing</HI> from tho&s;e of the <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> Their
Manners and Character, <HI>brave</HI> though not <HI>ferocious,</HI> had
naturally produced <HI>Tragedy,</HI> though of a Kind rather <HI>grand</HI>
than <HI>terrible</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect. vi. Art.

little given to <HI>Sarca&s;m,</HI> &s;eems to have <HI>prevented</HI> the
Birth of <HI>Comedy.</HI> GARCI|LASSO, indeed, divides their <HI>Drama</HI>
into <HI>Tragedy</HI> and <HI>Comedy:</HI> But this was manife&s;tly the Effect
of his own preconceived Opinions, and aro&s;e from a Habit of con|&s;idering
all <HI>dramatic</HI> Compo&s;ition as belonging to one <PB N="171" REF="174">
of the&s;e <HI>Species.</HI> For he tells us that 
<Q REND="inline">"their <HI>Tragedies</HI> repre&s;ented their
military Exploits; the <HI>Triumphs, Victories,</HI> and <HI>heroic
Actions</HI> of their renowned Men: And the Subject or De&s;ign of their

<HI>culti|vating</HI> and manuring their <HI>Fields,</HI> and to &s;hew the

barbarous Polities. But in another Re&s;pect, the Progre&s;&s;ion was different
from that in CHINA. The <HI>Actors</HI> maintained the original Dignity which
they had held in the early Periods: For the <HI>Lords</HI> and

<P>To the&s;e we may add one In&s;tance more, concerning the natural
Union and Progre&s;&s;ion of Mu&s;ic and Poetry: An In&s;tance le&s;s known,
yet more &s;ingular than any of the&s;e already given. When the <HI>Chri&s;tian
Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> arrived on the Coa&s;t of <HI>proper India,</HI> they
found a Sect called the "<HI>Chri&s;tians of St.</HI> THOMAS," living in great
Simplicity and Innocence; and retaining many of the original Cu&s;|toms of
their &s;avage Forefathers<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LA CROZE <HI>Hi&s;t.

<PB N="172" REF="175"> found the&s;e Chri&s;tians, as well as the Pagans of the
Coun|try, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of rude <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> and <HI>Poetry,</HI> in
their <HI>natural Union</HI> and <HI>Power.</HI> They acquie&s;ced in the
Application of the&s;e Arts, already made by the Chri&s;tian Tribe, and
wi&s;ely laid hold of their Influence, for the Conver&s;ion of the Pagan
Natives. Under the&s;e Circum&s;tances, the following Accounts will appear
natural and probable, on the Principles already delivered.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it appears that the general and Fundamental Practice of
<HI>&s;inging</HI> the <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> of <HI>great Men,</HI> had been
maintained from the mo&s;t ancient Times. In Con&s;equence of this, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Synode being ended, the Parti&s;ans of the

<HI>Song,</HI> which contained the whole <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of the
<HI>Portu|gue&s;e Prelate,</HI> and a pompous Detail of what had pa&s;&s;ed at

to Po&s;terity by this Kind of Poem all the mo&s;t remarkable Events. The Song
was caught and immediately di&s;per&s;ed every where; and during the Vi&s;its
which the Prelate made, the People &s;ung it in his Pre&s;ence; which together
with their <HI>Dances</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> made the chief Part of his
Entertain|ment<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LA CROZE <HI>Hi&s;t. du

<P>The religious <HI>Song</HI> and <HI>Dance</HI> were no le&s;s
remarkably and &s;ingularly maintained in a Kind of imperfect <HI>Union,</HI> 
<PB N="173" REF="176"> as they had been transfered from <HI>Pagan</HI> Objects

<P>The Mi&s;&s;ionaries who have vi&s;ited the oppo&s;ite Coa&s;t of
COROMANDEL, give us Proof, that the <HI>Progre&s;&s;ion</HI> of
<HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> and <HI>Poetry</HI> had not &s;topped at this early Period,
but advanced to <HI>theatrical Repre&s;entation</HI>; which, we &s;hall &s;ee,

<P>LET us now, in Conclu&s;ion, analyze the State of Me|lody and Song,

<P>The leading Singularity of this extraordinary People was their
Rejection of Idolatry, and their e&s;tabli&s;hed Wor&s;hip of the <HI>one</HI>
GOD, the <HI>Creator</HI> of the World. As this Cir|cum&s;tance gave a peculiar
Colour to their <HI>Religion</HI>; &s;o, upon the Principles of this
Di&s;&s;ertation it will follow, that it mu&s;t give a Peculiar Turn to their
<HI>Mu&s;ic</HI>; becau&s;e we have &s;een, that the Genius of the <HI>original
Mu&s;ic</HI> of every Country depends on its <HI>Religion</HI> as its chief
<HI>Ba&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>In Con&s;equence of this Principle, their <HI>Song</HI> or
<HI>Poem</HI> was chiefly dedicated to the <HI>Celebration</HI> of the
<HI>true</HI> GOD, the <HI>Creator</HI> of all things: At other Times it is
compo&s;ed of <HI>moral Exhortations,</HI> delivered as the Dictates of his
Will, or thrown out in prophetic Raptures concerning the great Intents of his
Providence.&mdash;Hence the <HI>Hymn, Ode,</HI> or poetic <HI>Rapture,</HI>
which we have found to be naturally the fir&s;t Form of Compo&s;ition among all
Na|tions, appeared with unrivaled Splendor in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Poetry,
becau&s;e its <HI>Object</HI> is &s;o much <HI>Superior</HI> to that of other

by tho&s;e who compo&s;ed them, are &s;o many &s;triking In&s;tances of the
true and unequaled Sublime.</P>
<P>With Re&s;pect to the <HI>Form,</HI> it may be ob&s;erved, that
their <HI>Songs</HI> or <HI>Hymns</HI> are of that <HI>mixed</HI> Species which
naturally ari&s;eth fir&s;t, before any Separations take Place, or produce the
&s;everal Species of Compo&s;ition. Though the <HI>hymnal</HI> Form be chiefly
<HI>predominant,</HI> yet we find them frequently to be a Mixture of <HI>Ode,
Narration,</HI> and <HI>Dia|logue</HI>; and thus they contain the Seeds or
Principles of the three great &s;ucceeding Kinds, of <HI>unmixed Ode,
Epic,</HI> and <HI>Tragedy.</HI></P>
<P>It may be regarded as an extraordinary Circum&s;tance, that this
fir&s;t <HI>mixed</HI> Form of Compo&s;ition &s;hould have continued unchanged
for a Period of at lea&s;t a thou&s;and Years; and that from fir&s;t to la&s;t
it &s;hould never move forward, &s;o as to produce the <HI>Epic</HI> and
<HI>Dramatic</HI> Species: But on Examination it will appear, that the &s;ame
Cau&s;e (the Wor&s;hip of the one GOD) which produced the highe&s;t Degree of
Sublime in the <HI>hymnal</HI> Species, naturally <HI>checked</HI> the Cour&s;e
of poetry among the JEWS; and pre|vented that <HI>Progre&s;&s;ion</HI> which we
have found to ari&s;e from the natural State of Things, in <HI>Pagan</HI>
Countries.</P>
<P>With Re&s;pect to the <HI>Epic</HI> Poem, we have &s;een that, in
its fir&s;t and original Conception and Formation, it is no 
<PB N="177" REF="180"> other than 
<Q REND="inline">"A fabulous Hi&s;tory, rowling chiefly on the great
Actions of the Gods and Heroes of the Nation; and compo&s;ed under certain
Limitations with Re&s;pect to its Manner, for the Ends of Plea&s;ure,
Admiration, and In&s;truction."</Q> Hence, the <HI>true</HI> GOD being the
&s;ole Object of the Adoration of the HEBREWS, and their Re|cords being the
&s;acred Depo&s;itary of the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of his <HI>Providence,</HI> the
Truth of which it was deemed the highe&s;t Crime to violate; the Invention and
Con&s;truction of an <HI>Epic Fable</HI> could never be the Re&s;ult of a
natural and un|taught Progre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Epic</HI> Form was thus naturally prevented by the
Severity of Truth, the fir&s;t Form of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and <HI>dramatic
Exhibition</HI> mu&s;t of Cour&s;e be checked from the &s;ame Principle: For we
have &s;een that the native and original tragic Species is but an Union of the
Ode and Epic Fable, animated by per&s;onal Repre&s;entation. To this we may
&s;ubjoin, that an additional Ab&s;urdity would here pre&s;ent it&s;elf: The
Ab&s;urdity of cloathing the <HI>Deity</HI> in a vi&s;ible and <HI>human
Form:</HI> A Circum&s;tance &s;trictly forbidden by the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
Law.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that although the&s;e Rea&s;ons are good, again&s;t
their introducing the <HI>Deity</HI> as the leading Subject either of
<HI>Epic</HI> or <HI>dramatic Fable,</HI> yet &s;till their <HI>Heroes</HI>
might have furni&s;hed Subjects for <HI>Both:</HI> We may reply, that all the
great Actions of their Heroes were &s;o inti|mately connected with the
important Hi&s;tory of Provi|dence, which this People were de&s;tined both to
<HI>execute</HI> and <HI>pre&s;erve,</HI> that even <HI>The&s;e</HI> became
improper Subjects for the Mixture and Alloy of Fable. And farther; The very
Tendency of Fancy towards &s;uch a Progre&s;&s;ion of <PB N="178" REF="181">
Poetry was quenched <HI>here</HI> al&s;o, in its fir&s;t Conception. For the
fir&s;t and original Enthu&s;ia&s;ms of an untaught Tribe are awakened by the
Belief, that their decea&s;ed Heroes are advanced to the Rank of <HI>Gods,</HI>
and &s;till main|tain their former <HI>Relation</HI> and <HI>Affection</HI> to
their native <HI>Country:</HI> Hence the Imagination is kindled by Hope of
their Favour and A&s;&s;i&s;tance: Hence Adoration ri&s;eth; flattering Fables
of their Power, Prowe&s;s, and Atchieve|ments, are invented; and the Genius of
<HI>Epic</HI> and <HI>Tragic</HI> Song is awakened into Action. But where (as
among the JEWS) their greate&s;t Men are repre&s;ented as what they were, weak,
ignorant, and mortal; often humbled for their Sins; always under the Controul
of an over-ruling Providence; and after Death, lo&s;t to every earthly
Con|nexion; here, the fir&s;t natural Enthu&s;ia&s;ms of the Soul could meet
with no Objects to excite them: A Colli&s;ion was wanting: And the artle&s;s
Mind, in&s;tructed only in &s;acred Things, returned of it&s;elf to the unmixed
and in|artificial Celebration of the <HI>all-wi&s;e</HI> and
<HI>all-powerful</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>As, from the&s;e Cau&s;es, the Forms of their <HI>Song</HI> never
had any Progre&s;&s;ion; &s;o, it &s;eems probable, that their <HI>Melody</HI>
&s;tood &s;till, in the &s;ame Manner. Its Application was chiefly to the
Service of Religion; and as their Hymn continued unchanged in its Genius, we
may rea&s;onably believe that the Melody which accompanied it, had the &s;ame
Fate. For though there was nothing particular ordained, with Re&s;pect to
Mu&s;ic, in the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law; yet, where almo&s;t every other
Circum&s;tance relative to Wor&s;hip was particularly pre&s;cribed, this
Severity of In|&s;titution would give a Kind of Sanctity to every ancient
Cu&s;tom that &s;tood connected with it; and hence their Modes of Melody would
probably remain unchanged. <PB N="179" REF="182" MS="y"> CLEMENS ALEXANDRINUS
informs us, that their Hymns were compo&s;ed in the <HI>Dorian</HI> Mode<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>STROMAT. l. vi.</BIBL></NOTE>: Which, what|ever it was, we
know to have been one of the mo&s;t <HI>an|cient,</HI> as well as
<HI>grave</HI> and <HI>&s;edate</HI>; and therefore fit for the Service of the
Temple.&mdash;Their In&s;truments were various, but &s;imple: That which DAVID
chiefly u&s;ed, appears to have been the <HI>Nabla</HI> or <HI>Trigonon</HI>; a
three-cornered In&s;trument, of the <HI>Harp</HI>-Species. Its Compa&s;s we
know from his own Authority; and that it was an In&s;trument of <HI>ten
Strings.</HI> We may be a&s;&s;ured, too, that his Melody was not only
&s;imple, but &s;ingle: For he mu&s;t have held his Harp with one Hand, and
played with the other, when he led the <HI>religious Dance</HI> before the
Ark.</P>
<P>As their <HI>Song</HI> and <HI>Melody,</HI> &s;o their
<HI>Dance</HI> &s;eems to have been chiefly employed in the Service of
Religion. The mo&s;t frequent Exerci&s;e of this religious Rite devolved upon
the Women. It appears too, that the Prophets had &s;ome Kind of <HI>&s;olemn
Movements,</HI> &s;uited to the State and Circum&s;tances of their divine
Enthu&s;ia&s;m: This Branch of the triple mu&s;ical Alliance &s;eems (as in
other Countries) to have made the earlie&s;t Separation. It ap|pears to have
been chiefly exerci&s;ed by the lower Ranks, in the Time of DAVID: And hence it
was, that MICHAL, the Daughter of SAUL, like a true fine Lady, de&s;pi&s;ed
that Monarch, for exerci&s;ing a Mode of Piety, which in her Days was <HI>no
longer fa&s;hionable.</HI></P>
<P>As to the united or complex Character of <HI>Legi&s;lator</HI> and
<HI>Bard,</HI> it is remarkable, that this was pre&s;erved among the JEWS
through a longer Succe&s;&s;ion of Ages than in any other Nation, from the
&s;ame Cau&s;e which prevented any <PB N="180" REF="183"> Progre&s;&s;ion or
Change in the Forms of their Song: For the mu&s;ical Art being chiefly
exerci&s;ed in the Prai&s;es of the true GOD, was in le&s;s Danger of being
<HI>corrupted,</HI> and therefore not only its <HI>Utility</HI> was longer
<HI>pre&s;erved,</HI> but likewi&s;e its <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors</HI> were in le&s;s
Danger of being <HI>deba&s;ed,</HI> than in other Countries where trifling or
immoral Ap|plications of the Art en&s;ued. Con&s;equently, the Rulers of the
People could have no Temptation to quit any Part of that Character or Office,
which &s;till maintained its pri&s;tine U&s;e and Dignity. Accordingly, we
find, that from MOSES down to SOLOMON, during a Period of at lea&s;t a
thou&s;and Years, the <HI>complex</HI> Character of <HI>Legi&s;lator</HI> and
<HI>Bard</HI> often appeared in the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Leaders of their
State, and from fir&s;t to la&s;t remained unbroken. MOSES, their fir&s;t great
Lawgiver, led the Song of Triumph, on the Overthrow of the <HI>Egyptians</HI>
in the <HI>Red-Sea</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>EXODUS.</BIBL></NOTE>:
MIRIAM, a di&s;tingui&s;hed Prophete&s;s, led the female Dance and Choir, on
the &s;ame Occa&s;ion<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. While
the <HI>Judges</HI> ruled in ISRAEL, this complex Office &s;till remained:
DEBORAH is an In&s;tance of this Truth: She <HI>judged</HI> ISRAEL; and &s;ung
her noble Song of Triumph, on the Death of SISERA and JABIN. We find, that
whoever was rai&s;ed to the Station of a <HI>Judge,</HI> or <HI>Chief,</HI> was
commonly inve&s;ted not only with the <HI>prophetic</HI> but the
<HI>bard-like</HI> Character: For we know, that the Prophets generally &s;ung
their pro|phetic Raptures to the Harp<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>1 SAM.
x.&mdash;1 CHRON. xxv.</BIBL></NOTE>. In After-times, when SAUL was elected
<HI>King,</HI> he too a&s;&s;umed at once the pro|phetic and mu&s;ical Office.
The Songs and bard-like Powers of DAVID, his <HI>kingly</HI> Succe&s;&s;or, are
too well known <PB N="181" REF="184"> to need an Illu&s;tration. The &s;ame
mu&s;ical and poetic Character maintained its Union with that of <HI>King,</HI>
in his Son SOLOMON; who&s;e <HI>Songs,</HI> we are told, were no le&s;s than a
<HI>thou&s;and and five.</HI> After him the <HI>complex</HI> Office of
<HI>Legi&s;lator</HI> and <HI>Bard</HI> &s;eems to have <HI>&s;eparated:</HI>
The peculiar Cau&s;es which had &s;o long upheld it in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
State, now began to cea&s;e: For <HI>Idolatry</HI> more and more pre|vailed,
<HI>Manners</HI> became <HI>corrupt,</HI> and public Mi&s;ery and Ruin
en&s;ued. The <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Bards</HI> were now no lon|ger found in
the Courts of Kings, or among the Rulers of the People: Yet &s;till they
continued to throw out the Emanations of prophetic and moral Truth, accompanied
with the Enthu&s;ia&s;m of <HI>Song,</HI> in the more retired, and yet
uncorrupt Situations of private Life: And &s;uch were the <HI>later
Prophets,</HI> who&s;e Writings &s;till remain in Scrip|ture.</P>
<P>As this appears to be a true Analy&s;is of the State of
<HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> among the ancient HEBREWS; it will now lead us to an ea&s;y
Solution of a Fact which hath been regarded as my&s;terious by &s;ome of the
Learned; 
<Q REND="inline">"That while mo&s;t other Nations had their
<HI>Bards</HI> or <HI>Poets</HI>; the JEWS, though their Compo&s;itions are
uncommonly &s;ublime, never had any <HI>Poets by Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> nor even
a Word in their Language which denotes the Character<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>CALMET. <HI>Di&s;&s;ert. &s;ur la Poe&s;ie,</HI>
&amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> The Principles here given afford a clear Solution
of this Sin|gularity. Their <HI>Prophets</HI> were indeed their <HI>Bards</HI>;
and appear to have been inve&s;ted with all the Dignity belong|ing to that
Office in its mo&s;t honoured State. But as the Almighty GOD, and the great
Events of his <HI>Providence,</HI> <PB N="182" REF="185" MS="y"> were the
continued <HI>Object</HI> of their <HI>Songs</HI>; &s;o, the <HI>poetic</HI> or
<HI>mu&s;ical</HI> Character was but <HI>&s;econdary</HI> to the
<HI>religious:</HI> Therefore the Name of <HI>Bard</HI> was &s;wallowed up and

<HEAD>SECT, XI. Of the State of Mu&s;ic and Poetry in ancient
ROME.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now traced the Progre&s;s of <HI>Melody</HI> and
<HI>Song,</HI> through the mo&s;t remarkable Periods of tho&s;e various
Nations, in which their <HI>Ri&s;e, Union,</HI> and <HI>Progre&s;s</HI> was
<HI>native</HI> and <HI>original.</HI> Let us now view them in their more
<HI>weak, borrowed,</HI> and <HI>&s;eparate</HI> State: This Inquiry will bring
us down to our own Times: And here we mu&s;t occa&s;ionally quit the ancient
Names of <HI>Melody</HI> and <HI>Song</HI>; and &s;ometimes adopt tho&s;e
Titles which the two Arts (now &s;eparate) received in the later Ages of
GREECE, and which they have ever &s;ince retained among the poli&s;hed Nations
of EUROPE, I mean tho&s;e of MUSIC and POETRY.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Flight which <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> and <HI>Poetry</HI> took
from GREECE was to ROME: For in this imperial City, they were not
<HI>native.</HI> The Cau&s;es of this original Defect, together with the State
and Progre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e Arts at ROME, on their Arrival from GREECE,
will make the Sub|ject of this Section.</P>
<P>The only Cau&s;e that hath been a&s;&s;igned for the Want of Mu&s;ic
and Poetry among the <HI>Romans</HI> in the early Ages of the Republic, hath
been 
<Q REND="inline">"that their Attention to War and Conque&s;t
&s;wallowed up all other Regards; and <PB N="183" REF="186"> therefore Mu&s;ic
and Poetry were of cour&s;e neglected."</Q> This Rea&s;oning might hold, if
the&s;e Arts made no more than a mere <HI>Amu&s;ement</HI> in the
<HI>early</HI> Ages, as they gene|rally do in the <HI>later</HI> Periods of a
State. But as it appears in the Cour&s;e of this Di&s;&s;ertation, that Melody
and Song are the natural Produce of &s;avage Life, however warlike; that the
Continuance of this warlike Character tends ra|ther to heighten than
extingui&s;h their Power; and that the Hi&s;tory of human Nature confirms this
Truth; We mu&s;t therefore &s;eek for this peculiar Defect in &s;ome other, and
more hidden Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>There is a Principle which relates to the E&s;tabli&s;hment and
Character of <HI>Colonies,</HI> which will hereafter appear at|tended with
exten&s;ive Con&s;equences, and which will a&s;&s;i&s;t us in unfolding the
true Foundation of this Defect.</P>
<P><HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song,</HI> being the natural Effects
of &s;avage Manners continuing through &s;everal Ages, it mu&s;t follow, that
<HI>Colonies</HI> will in general be found to po&s;&s;e&s;s them in a very
imperfect State. Fox <HI>Colonies</HI> are &s;eldom &s;ent out, till that early
Period is pa&s;t, when the <HI>Legi&s;lator's</HI> and <HI>Bard's</HI>
Character are <HI>united</HI> in the &s;ame Per&s;on. Hence, the
<HI>Leader</HI> of the new Colony not being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the poetic and
mu&s;ical Enthu&s;ia&s;m, can neither have <HI>Ability</HI> nor
<HI>Inclination</HI> to in&s;til or propagate the&s;e Arts among his Followers.
Thus the fir&s;t leading Flame of Enthu&s;ia&s;m is quenched: And the inferior
Ranks, being bu&s;ied in the Affairs of their new Settlement, have not that
Lei&s;ure which the unemployed &s;avage State affords, to turn their Attention
on the&s;e natural Plea&s;ures: For Colonies of Men &s;eldom depart from their
native Country, unle&s;s when driven by &s;ome Kind of <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity:</HI>
And there|fore <PB N="184" REF="187"> mu&s;t betake them&s;elves, for
Sub&s;i&s;tance, either to <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> or <HI>War.</HI> The la&s;t of
the&s;e was the chief Occu|pation of the <HI>Roman</HI> State: And thus, not
becau&s;e they were a <HI>warlike</HI> People, but becau&s;e they were a
<HI>needy Colony,</HI> the <HI>mu&s;ical Arts</HI> which were &s;o
<HI>powerful</HI> in <HI>early</HI> GREECE, were &s;o <HI>weak</HI> in
<HI>early</HI> ROME.</P>
<P>This Ob&s;ervation will hold true of mo&s;t other Countries peopled
by foreign Nations after a certain Period of Civi|lization. Thus CARTHAGE was a
Colony which went out from TYRE: And <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> which was of Weight in
the <HI>native</HI> City, was of no Con&s;ideration in the
<HI>de&s;cendant</HI> State. Thus again, the <HI>Iri&s;h, Wel&s;h,</HI> and
<HI>Scots,</HI> are &s;trictly <HI>natives</HI>; and accordingly, have a
Mu&s;ic of <HI>their own:</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> on the contrary, are a
foreign Mixture of late-e&s;tabli&s;hed Colonies; and as a Con&s;equence of
this, have <HI>no native Mu&s;ic.</HI> He who would find the <HI>original
Mu&s;ic</HI> of ENGLAND, mu&s;t &s;eek it in WALES.</P>
<P>Here, then, appears the true Cau&s;e of this Defect in the early
Ages of ROME. So ignorant were the <HI>Trojan</HI> Found|ers of the Empire in
the mu&s;ical Arts, that they had not even the fir&s;t Rudiments of
<HI>Song:</HI> For we are told by a learned <HI>Roman,</HI> that when ENEAS
brought the Images of the Gods to Shore, 
<Q REND="inline">"the <HI>Women howled</HI> and <HI>danced</HI> at
the Solemnity<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>DIONYS. <HI>Halicarn.</HI> l. i. c.
55.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of the mu&s;ical Arts in ROME confirms this general
Principle: Their Mu&s;ic and Poetry was always <HI>borrowed</HI> and
<HI>adopted:</HI> Let us trace its Progre&s;s through the &s;everal
&s;ucceeding ages.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="188">NUMA POMPILIUS fir&s;t introduced the&s;e Arts
into the <HI>Roman</HI> religious Ceremonies. Had he been a <HI>Native</HI> of
ROME, he had been a clear Exception to the Principle here given: But in&s;tead
of overturning, he confirms it: For he was a retired, philo&s;ophic, and
illu&s;trious <HI>Sabine:</HI> And the <HI>Salian</HI> Prie&s;ts which he
e&s;tabli&s;hed, were <HI>Mu&s;icians</HI> or <HI>Bards,</HI> who had been
brought by EVANDER from ARCADIA into ITALY<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>DIONYS. <HI>Hal.</HI> l. i.</BIBL></NOTE>. Thus, the
<HI>Salian</HI> Songs were not <HI>native,</HI> but <HI>tran&s;planted</HI>
into ROME.</P>
<P>We find no farther Progre&s;s in the mu&s;ical and poetic Arts, for
many Ages: Save only, that a vague Rumour prevailed in the later Periods of the
Commonwealth, that in ancient Times it had been u&s;ual to &s;ing the Prai&s;es
of great Men at Fea&s;ts<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>CICERO <HI>de Leg.</HI>
l. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The next Progre&s;&s;ion of the mu&s;ical Arts in ROME, was the
<HI>Adoption</HI> of the <HI>Thu&s;can Shews:</HI> The&s;e, as LIVY in|forms
us, were called in from ETRURIA during a fatal Pe&s;tilence, with a View of
appea&s;ing the angry Gods<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LIV. <HI>Hi&s;t.</HI>
l. vii.</BIBL></NOTE>. The borrowed Flame was &s;oon caught and &s;pread among
the <HI>Roman</HI> Youth; who by Degrees gave <HI>Voice</HI> to the <HI>mute
Action</HI> of the <HI>Thu&s;cans.</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e the <HI>Atellane</HI> Plays &s;ucceeded; being in the
&s;ame Manner <HI>borrowed</HI> and adopted by the <HI>Roman</HI> People from
the OSCI, a neighbouring Province: Both the&s;e, and the <HI>Thu&s;can
Shews</HI> &s;eem to have been <HI>native</HI> in their re&s;pective
Di&s;tricts; and therefore we need go no farther in Que&s;t of their true
Origin, than to the untaught Progre&s;&s;ion and Se|paration of <HI>Melody,
Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song:</HI> But on their fir&s;t 
<PB N="186" REF="189" MS="y"> Entrance into ROME, the&s;e dramatic &s;hews were
no longer in their <HI>natural,</HI> but in an <HI>ingrafted</HI> State. The
fir&s;t Idea, then, of <HI>Comedy</HI> was caught by <HI>Adoption</HI> in this
Republic: Here, as in the Adoption of the <HI>Salian Songs,</HI> they were mere
<HI>Imitators.</HI> And thus, contrary to the natural Cour&s;e of Things (as we
have proved above<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Sect. vii.</BIBL></NOTE>)
<HI>Comedy</HI> had, by Accident, an E&s;tabli&s;hment prior to
<HI>Tragedy</HI> in ancient ROME.</P>
<P>As it appears that in the fir&s;t Periods of theatrical and dramatic
Repre&s;entation, it is natural for the <HI>Poet</HI> to <HI>act</HI> a Part in
his own Plays<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Sect. vi.</BIBL></NOTE>; &s;o
LIVIUS ANDRONICUS, the fir&s;t known dramatic Poet of ROME<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Art. 26.</BIBL></NOTE>, maintained this natural
<HI>Union</HI> of the <HI>Poet</HI> and <HI>Actor,</HI> which he had received
from the adopted Shews. But &s;o little were theatrical Repre&s;entations the
Effect of Nature at ROME, and &s;o much were they received as mere Shews of
<HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Amu&s;ement,</HI> that even at this early Period an
unexampled <HI>Separation</HI> commenced; a Separation more ab&s;urd than any
that had taken Place in GREECE. For now, 
<Q REND="inline">"LIVIUS acting his own Play according to the
Cu&s;tom of the Times, was compelled by the People to repeat &s;ome favourite
Pa&s;&s;ages, till his Voice grew hoar&s;e: On which, he obtained Leave to

<HI>mute</HI> Action. We may &s;afely pronounce it impo&s;&s;ible that this
Separation could have come on, unle&s;s the theatric Repre&s;entations had
already degenerated into a mere <HI>Amu&s;ement.</HI> When a <HI>&s;lave</HI>

<P>As this Event happened many Years after the mu&s;ical Arts had
lo&s;t their <HI>Union,</HI> their proper <HI>Ends,</HI> and original
<HI>Genius</HI> in the <HI>Mother-Country</HI>; &s;o it was natural, that the

<HI>perverted</HI> State which the&s;e Arts held when the <HI>Greeks</HI> were

fir&s;t to their la&s;t Progre&s;&s;ions in ROME; where we &s;hall find, that

into Things pernicious.</P>
<P>In the early Periods of GREECE, the Poet compo&s;ed the Melody for
his Plays: In the Decline of the Greek States, the Melody was the di&s;tinct
Labour of another Per&s;on<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect. vi.

Conduct <PB N="188" REF="191"> natural among tho&s;e who con&s;idered the&s;e
Arts as the In|&s;truments of Plea&s;ure only. The nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence
of this was the gradual Introduction of an effeminate and luxuriant Melody; of
which both CICERO<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Leg.</HI> l.

<P>In Con&s;equence of the&s;e, a new and fatal Separation en|&s;ued.
The <HI>Player,</HI> who in the uncorrupted Ages of GREECE was often of the
<HI>fir&s;t Rank</HI> in the Republic, was generally of <HI>&s;lavi&s;h</HI>

<P>With Re&s;pect to the <HI>Subjects</HI> of their <HI>Tragedy,</HI>
they were here no le&s;s mere Imitators. For although they had one Species in
which their own Great Men were the <HI>Heroes</HI> of the Poem, yet even this
was not original, but altogether built on the <HI>Grecian</HI> Model. But
farther, we learn from HORACE, that the mo&s;t approved Subjects were tho&s;e
which were drawn from HOMER's Poems. He gives this as a Rule to the Poets of
his Time and <PB N="189" REF="192" MS="y"> Country; 
<Q REND="inline">"That to throw the Fables of the <HI>Iliad</HI> into
tragic Scenes is a &s;afer and better Practice, than to at|tempt Subjects yet
untouched."</Q> A Pa&s;&s;age which con|tains the cleare&s;t Proof, that
Tragedy was now &s;eparated from its highe&s;t Purpo&s;es; and that the
<HI>great Ends</HI> of this <HI>Poem,</HI> which gave it &s;o much
<HI>Power</HI> in GREECE, were utterly lo&s;t to the Roman People.</P>
<P>The primary Applications of <HI>Tragedy</HI> being thus little known
in ROME, even on its fir&s;t Admi&s;&s;ion; we cannot wonder that it became a
weak and languid Amu&s;ement: E&s;pecially, among a People who&s;e Manners
were, now &s;inking into That Character which tended to give <HI>Comedy</HI>
the A&s;cendant, as in the declining Period of the <HI>Greek</HI> States. Thus
the true Cau&s;e appears, why <HI>Comedy</HI> was cultivated &s;o much more
than <HI>Tragedy,</HI> in every Period of this Republic.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ode</HI> or <HI>hymnal</HI> Species &s;eems to have been as
ef|fectually &s;eparated from the Ends of <HI>Public Utility,</HI> as the
<HI>Tragic</HI> Poem. HORACE often declares his Inability to attempt any thing
<HI>Great</HI> in this Kind. The general Cha|racter of his Odes corre&s;ponds
much with his own Sen|timent: They are always elegant, &s;eldom maje&s;tic. His
<HI>Irreligion</HI> even <HI>di&s;qualified</HI> him from excelling in the
<HI>highe&s;t Species</HI> of the <HI>Ode:</HI> For of this, we have &s;een,
<HI>Religion</HI> mu&s;t be the <HI>Object:</HI> And although there be a
variety of fine <HI>moral</HI> Apothegms, and frequent Allu&s;ions to the
<HI>public State</HI> of ROME; yet the&s;e are always <HI>checked,</HI> and
made <HI>&s;ub&s;ervient</HI> to the Favour of MAECENAS and AUGUSTUS. In a
Word, they are but <HI>&s;econdary: Urbanity</HI> of Senti|ment,
<HI>Elegance</HI> of <HI>Phra&s;e,</HI> and of <HI>Compliment</HI> to his
Ma&s;|ters, were manife&s;tly his <HI>fir&s;t Object.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="193">With Regard to the Character of the famed
<HI>Roman Epic</HI> Poem; notwith&s;tanding the inordinate Prai&s;es that have

that neither the <HI>original</HI> nor <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> Spirit of ancient
GREECE appear with any uniform Splen|dor through the Cour&s;e of this
celebrated Work. Elegant in Diction, a Ma&s;ter in Rythm and Numbers, nervous

wanted that all-comprehen&s;ive Genius which alone can conceive and &s;trike
out a great original Epic Plan, no le&s;s than that independent Greatne&s;s of
Soul which was quenched by the <HI>ruinous Policy</HI> of the Times, and which
alone can animate true Genius to a full Exertion of its Powers in the Cau&s;e

<P>As both the <HI>Ode</HI> and <HI>Epic</HI> had thus degenerated from
their original Character in GREECE, &s;o we &s;hall find that the
<HI>Recitation</HI> of them kept Pace with this &s;purious Birth. We have
already &s;een, that in the more early Periods of the <HI>Greek</HI> Republics,
their Poems were <HI>&s;ung</HI> to the &s;ur|rounding Audience for the
important Ends of <HI>Religion,</HI> <PB N="191" REF="194"> <HI>Morals,</HI>

<HI>Song</HI> brought down to <HI>Recitation,</HI> and the&s;e <HI>great
Purpo&s;es</HI> &s;wallowed up and lo&s;t in the <HI>Vanity</HI> and
<HI>Self-Importance</HI> of the <HI>Poet.</HI> Hence we find their be&s;t
Writers declaring their Di&s;like to the Practice of <HI>public
Recitation,</HI> becau&s;e Flattery was now become the Food of every reciting
Poeta&s;ter. The whole Farce and Foppery of this Practice, which was indeed no
other than the &s;purious I&s;&s;ue of the old <HI>Grecian Song-Fea&s;t,</HI>
is given at large by VOSSIUS, to whom, for Brevity's Sake, we refer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Imitatione,</HI> c. 7, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ical Arts, being thus <HI>&s;eparated,</HI> and
<HI>perverted</HI> from their <HI>proper Ends,</HI> no Wonder that we hear &s;o
little of their being applied to the <HI>Education</HI> of <HI>Youth,</HI> in

<P>On the contrary, as Manners and Principles grew more profligate,

Burthen, but became at length of mo&s;t pernicious In|fluence on the State. The
Attention to the <HI>mimetic</HI> Art was now carried to a mo&s;t ridiculous
Extreme. CICERO informs us, that the Players practi&s;ed &s;everal Years,
before <PB N="192" REF="195"> they ventured upon the Stage<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>CIC. <HI>de Oratore,</HI> l. i.</BIBL></NOTE>: That the

They gargled the Throat with a Compo&s;ition proper for the Purpo&s;e: And the
Methods of managing and improving the Voice were now formed into a &s;eparate
Science<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PERSIUS <HI>Sat.</HI> I.</BIBL></NOTE>.
In a Word, LIVY complains, that

<P>In the later Periods the Mi&s;chief grew &s;till more intolerable:
For now, the &s;erious Arts were cultivated by Few: Nothing was heard but light
and effeminate Mu&s;ic: The Singer took the Philo&s;opher's Place; the
Libraries were &s;hut up; and the general Attention was turned upon mu&s;ical
In&s;truments proper to accompany and &s;u&s;tain the Ge&s;ticulation of the
Actors. The Effects of this Di&s;&s;olute Ta&s;te &s;oon appeared: For
QUINTILIAN tells us, that 
<Q REND="inline">"the effeminate and immode&s;t Mu&s;ic of the Stage
had no incon&s;iderable Part in de&s;troying that &s;mall Degree of manly
Character which had been left among them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>In&s;t.</HI> l. i.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The Evil &s;till increa&s;ed: So that in the Time of NERO, 
<Q REND="inline">"The City &s;warmed with <HI>Pantomimes:</HI> Every
private Hou&s;e now became a Theatre; and the Hu&s;band and Wife contended,
which &s;hould mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully <HI>pro|&s;titute</HI> them&s;elves to
the <HI>Favour</HI> of the <HI>Actors</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>SENECA

<P><PB N="193" REF="196" MS="y">There is a Time, when Nature
&s;truggles hard to free her&s;elf from peccant and deadly Humours. This Time
was now come at ROME; but it came too late: The Body politic was expiring, and
was not able to &s;hake off the Evil: The Pantomimes were twice expelled; but
&s;till returned again<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>TAC. <HI>An.</HI> l. xiii,

amid&s;t the Spoils of a &s;ubjected World, now begged before their own
Doors.</P>
<P>The extravagant Pa&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of their later Emperors for
the mu&s;ical Arts, and the&s;e too of the mo&s;t debauched and profligate
Characters, particularly CALIGULA and NERO, is too well known to need a
Delineation: This E&s;&s;ay is not intended as a <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of
<HI>Facts,</HI> but an <HI>Inve&s;ti|gation</HI> of the <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> that
produced them. On this Subject, therefore, there is one Circum&s;tance which
may demand our attention. We have &s;een above, that the fir&s;t original
Legi&s;lators turned their Attention &s;trongly on the mu&s;ical Arts; and we
now find, that the abandoned Rulers of a decaying Empire adopt them with no
le&s;s Eagerne&s;s: Doth not this Contrariety of Facts &s;eem to &s;hake &s;ome
of the Principles which we have attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h? So far from this,
that it confirms them: For in both In|&s;tances, <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> was made
<HI>&s;ub&s;ervient</HI> to the <HI>Views</HI> or ruling <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI>
of tho&s;e who <HI>led</HI> the People. The hone&s;t Legi&s;|lators of early
Times employed it for the Ends of public Utility; the profligate Emperors
abu&s;ed it to the Purpo&s;es <PB N="194" REF="197"> of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s.
Among the former, by a legitimate U&s;e, it became the In&s;trument of
e&s;tabli&s;hing Common-wealths: Among the latter, by a perverted Application,
it &s;hook the Foundations of Empire: ORPHEUS drew the barbarous Tribes, from
Theft, Adultery, and Murder, by his Songs and Lyre: NERO plundered his
Patricians of their E&s;tates to load his Mu&s;icians with Wealth; and amid&s;t
the forced Acclamations of a corrupted Theatre, violated a ve&s;tal Virgin on
the Stage.</P>

<P>THUS the mu&s;ical and poetic Arts &s;unk along with the
<HI>Roman</HI> Empire.&mdash;But Mankind, emerging from the Ruins of
<HI>Luxury, Profligacy,</HI> and <HI>Inva&s;ion,</HI> are of a different
Character from that of human Nature ari&s;ing from mere <HI>Barbarity</HI> into
<HI>Civilization.</HI> We have traced the natural Progre&s;s of the&s;e Arts in
the <HI>la&s;t</HI> of the&s;e; but from the former, nothing con&s;i&s;tent or
&s;teady can ari&s;e. The Views, Manners, Principles, and Pa&s;&s;ions of a
furious Conqueror, meeting and mixing with tho&s;e of a &s;ubdued and abandoned
People, produce &s;uch a Com|pound of di&s;&s;imilar and contending Cau&s;es,
as approach in their Effects to the Appearance of mere Chance or Fortune.</P>
<P>But the Circum&s;tance mo&s;t worth remarking is this, that in
&s;uch a Period, all the natural Seeds and Principles of the mu&s;ical Arts are
lo&s;t. The whole <HI>local</HI> Fabric of <PB N="195" REF="198"> <HI>Religion,
Polity,</HI> and <HI>Morals,</HI> is commonly &s;unk in the general Ruin; and a
barbarous Conqueror followed by an enraged Soldiery, who have left their own
Country to invade another, have generally the <HI>Vices</HI> of
<HI>Savages,</HI> with|out their <HI>Virtues.</HI></P>
<P>Hence the <HI>mu&s;ical</HI> Arts could not ari&s;e from the Ruins
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, but from the ineffectual Principle of <HI>mere
Imitation.</HI> They wanted that <HI>native</HI> Force and Vigour which had
given them &s;o free and full a Growth in ancient GREECE.</P>
<P>Such therefore being the Birth of the <HI>modern Poetry</HI> and
<HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> of EUROPE; having been the ca&s;ual Offspring of the corrupted
<HI>Roman</HI> Arts, which were them&s;elves no more than partial Imitations of
the <HI>Greek,</HI> in their State of Separation and Weakne&s;s; no Wonder if
the <HI>modern Tran&s;cript</HI> be <HI>inferior,</HI> not only to the
<HI>Original,</HI> but the <HI>fir&s;t Copy.</HI></P>
<P>This general Principle being given, we might perhaps end our Inquiry
here: Leaving the more particular In|ve&s;tigation to the good Sen&s;e and
Judgment of Mankind: But to give all po&s;&s;ible Satisfaction on a Subject
which may by &s;ome be regarded as a Matter of Curio&s;ity, we &s;hall trace
the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of the&s;e Arts in their chief Appearances, &s;o far
as they have Relation to each other.</P>
<P>Before the Roman Empire fell to Ruin, its Rulers took Care, to the
utmo&s;t of their Power, to extirpate the native Mu&s;ic of the barbarous
Countries which they conquered. Of this JULIUS CAESAR, AMMIANUS MARCELLINUS and
SUETONIUS inform us. This was a high Stroke of Policy: For their native Songs
being (as in ancient GREECE) the Repo&s;itory of their Religious and Political 
<PB N="196" REF="199"> Sy&s;tem, nothing could &s;o effectually
<HI>&s;ubdue</HI> the <HI>Minds</HI> of the&s;e Barbarians, as the Bani&s;hment
or De&s;truction of their <HI>Bards</HI> and <HI>Druids.</HI> We have already
&s;een Edward the Fir&s;t of ENGLAND acting the &s;ame Tragedy in WALES, on the
&s;ame Principle.</P>
<P>On the Revival of Learning, the three greater Kinds of
<HI>Poetry</HI> were, in many In&s;tances, nece&s;&s;arily <HI>divorced</HI>
from <HI>Mu&s;ic.</HI> For the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Poets being
the only approved <HI>Models,</HI> could be read and imitated by <HI>Scholars
only.</HI> Thus, the <HI>Art</HI> which in ancient GREECE had been the genuine
Effect of natural Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and aided by a native and corre&s;pondent
Melody, had been delivered to the People by the inraptured Bard, could now be
&s;tudied and attained only by the <HI>&s;eque&s;tered Few,</HI> who were
&s;wal|lowed up by a literary Application, often ignorant of the Powers of
Mu&s;ic, and little acquainted with Society and Mankind.&mdash;Hence the
<HI>Epic Poet</HI> (the Manners of the Times likewi&s;e forbidding<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See below, Sect. xiii.</BIBL></NOTE>) could no longer appear
at the Place of public Concour&s;e, with his Lyre and fe&s;tal Robes, to charm
the li&s;tening Audience with his legi&s;lative Songs; but retired to the
<HI>Clo&s;et,</HI> and with a more com|po&s;ed Mien delivered his
In&s;pirations in written Ver&s;e, for the Plea&s;ure, Admiration, and
In&s;truction of Mankind.&mdash;This might have been indured: Becau&s;e &s;ome
of the general Ends of that calmer Species may be obtained by a
<HI>Home-application.</HI> But the Misfortune was, that even <HI>Tragedy</HI>
and <HI>Ode,</HI> who&s;e End is to &s;hake the Soul with Terror, Pity, or Joy,
by a <HI>theatrical Exhibition</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>It hath become a favourite Topic among certain Per&s;ons, to
decry the theatrical Exhibition of Tragedy, as an Object below the Ambition of

at the Door of the Theatre, and been <HI>refu&s;ed Admittance,</HI> we &s;hall
not here <HI>affirm:</HI> But it belongs to our Subject to &s;hew on what
Foundation the theatrical Exhibition makes an e&s;&s;ential Part of Tragedy;
and that with|out it, the tragic Poem is an <HI>imperfect Species.</HI></P> 
<P>The Epic Poem not only imitates Actions, Sentiments, Characters,

Cir|cum&s;tances of Place, Per&s;on, Voice, Countenance, Attitude, and
Ge&s;ture: And hence a full and perfect Imitation en&s;ues. In the Dramatic or
Tragic Poem, little of this latter Kind can be admitted, without violating the
Probability and Power of the Dialogue: On this Foundation, the De&s;cription of
the&s;e external and attendant Circum&s;tances is nece&s;&s;arily left to the
Conduct of the <HI>Actor</HI>; who, in the&s;e Articles, a&s;&s;umes the

Of this Kind we have two noble ones in our Language, <PB N="198" REF="201"> by

<P>As the modern Poetry thus became often unfit for Mu&s;ic, &s;o from
a &s;ingular Cau&s;e the Separation was con|firmed, and Mu&s;ic in its Turn
became often unfit for Poe|try. After many Centuries had pa&s;&s;ed in
Darkne&s;s, GUIDO aro&s;e: And with a Force of Genius &s;urpa&s;&s;ing that of
all his Predece&s;&s;ors, invented the Art of <HI>Counter|point,</HI> or
<HI>Compo&s;ition</HI> in <HI>Parts:</HI> Yet this very Circum&s;tance, which
&s;eemed to promi&s;e &s;o noble an Improvement in Mu&s;ic, was a &s;trong
concurrent Cau&s;e of compleating its Divorce from Poetry. For now,
<HI>in&s;trumental</HI> Mu&s;ic, having a&s;&s;umed a new and more inviting
Form, and be|ing ennobled by the principles of a complex and varied
<HI>Harmony,</HI> was introduced as being of it&s;elf a <HI>compleat</HI>
Species, independent of Poetry or Song. This gave it an <HI>artificial</HI> and
<HI>laboured</HI> Turn; while the Compo&s;er went in Que&s;t of curious
Harmonies, Di&s;cords, Re&s;olutions, Fugues, and Canons; and prided him&s;elf
(like the Poet) in a pompous Di&s;play of Art, to the Neglect of
<HI>Expre&s;&s;ion</HI> and true <HI>Pathos.</HI> And thus modern Mu&s;ic, on
its fir&s;t Ri&s;e, was in a Manner divorced from <HI>Poetry,
Legi&s;lation,</HI> and <HI>Morals.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Cau&s;es &s;ufficiently account for the pre&s;ent State of
the two Si&s;ter Arts, in every In&s;tance of their <HI>total Separation.</HI>
Let us now con&s;ider them in tho&s;e Situations where their Union is indeed in
&s;ome Sort maintained, but this in an improper and ineffectual Manner.</P>
<P>The four di&s;tinct Forms in which the&s;e two Arts &s;till maintain
an imperfect Union are, 1. The common <HI>Song</HI> or <HI>Canzonette.</HI> 2.
The <HI>Opera,</HI> or <HI>Drama</HI> for the <HI>Stage.</HI> 
<PB N="199" REF="202"> 3. The <HI>Anthem,</HI> or <HI>Motet,</HI> for the
<HI>Church.</HI> 4. The <HI>Ora|torio,</HI> or <HI>&s;acred Drama.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The common <HI>Song</HI> or <HI>Canzonette</HI> hath &s;unk
from the original Dignity which it maintained in ancient GREECE, from two
evident Cau&s;es. Fir&s;t, The Separation of Mu&s;ic and Poetry from their
important Ends, and from each other, naturally prevented the modern Poets and
Mu&s;icians from con&s;idering this Species as being much worthy of their
Attention. Secondly, The nobler Applications of the <HI>Song</HI> being thus
relinqui&s;hed and lo&s;t, no Wonder if Men of high Station and moral Dignity
di&s;dained the Practice of it (even where they had Ability) as being an Object
unworthy of their Regard. Hence it hath come to pa&s;s, that this Species is
hardly &s;uppo&s;ed to touch on any Subject religious, political, or moral,
unle&s;s it be in Je&s;t<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">There are &s;ome Exceptions to
this general Ob&s;ervation; but they take Place chiefly among the
<HI>Vulgar</HI>; among whom the <HI>Ballad-Song</HI> com|monly retains its
<HI>moral</HI> and <HI>political</HI> Applications.</NOTE>. And thus the
reigning Topics of the <HI>Song</HI> are generally <HI>Love</HI> and
<HI>Wine.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have adopted both
the&s;e Subjects: The <HI>Chan&s;ons &agrave; boire</HI> of the former, and the
<HI>drinking Catches</HI> of the latter, are Proofs of their Jollity rather
than Ta&s;te: Yet they clearly di&s;play the different Characters of the two
Nations. A parallel Remark might perhaps be made on their <HI>Love-Songs:</HI>
With this Exception, however, that in a Song of this Kind, PURCEL hath left us
one of the fine&s;t and be&s;t va|ried Pieces of mu&s;ical Expre&s;&s;ion that
ever was com|po&s;ed<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"> From ro&s;y Bowers,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>: And in Ju&s;tice to the pre&s;ent Times it mu&s;t be
farther ob&s;erved, that in ENGLAND, this Species is <PB N="200" REF="203"> now
in a good Degree re&s;cued from its former Indelicacy. The <HI>Italians</HI>
and <HI>Scots</HI> have chiefly turned the <HI>Song</HI> on the Subject of
<HI>Love.</HI> With Re&s;pect to the <HI>Poetry,</HI> the <HI>Italian
Canzonettes</HI> are more elegantly written than the <HI>Scotch,</HI> though
with le&s;s Nature and Pa&s;&s;ion. In the <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> of the <HI>Italian
Canzonettes</HI> there is little Variety: They &s;oon di&s;gu&s;t, by their
Samene&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion: The <HI>Scotch Airs</HI> are perhaps the true&s;t
Model of artle&s;s and pathetic mu&s;ical Expre&s;&s;ion, that can be found in
the whole Compa&s;s of the Art. Some of them are &s;aid to have been the
Compo&s;ition of DAVID RIZZIO, who is &s;up|po&s;ed to have ingrafted the
<HI>Italian</HI> Regularity and Elegance of Song, on the original wild and
pathetic Manner of the <HI>Scots.</HI> This Tradition carries the Appearance of
Truth: For the <HI>Scotch</HI> Airs are of two different Kinds, ea&s;ily
di&s;tin|gui&s;hable from each other: The one <HI>regular,</HI> and &s;ubject
to the Rules of Counterpoint: The other wild and de&s;ultory, and &s;uch as do
not ea&s;ily receive the Accompanyment of a Ba&s;s. The fir&s;t of the&s;e may
&s;eem to have been the Com|po&s;ition or Reform of RIZZIO; but in Force of
Ex|pre&s;&s;ion and Pathos, the latter generally excel them: A Circum&s;tance
which proves how little the Rules of mo|dern Counterpoint have to do with the
<HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;ic.</HI></P>
<P N="2">The State of the <HI>Opera</HI> will de&s;erve a more
particular Elucidation: And to this End we mu&s;t endeavour to trace it to its
Origin, which lies in great Mea&s;ure hid in Darkne&s;s. RICCOBONI is of
Opinion that the fir&s;t ever repre&s;ented, was that which the <HI>Doge</HI>
and <HI>Senate</HI> of VENICE exhibited for the Entertainment of HENRY the
third of FRANCE, in the Year 1574<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Theat.</HI>
&amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>. But this Ac|count <PB N="201" REF="204" MS="y"> is by no
means &s;atisfactory: For SULPITIUS, an Italian, &s;peaks of the <HI>mu&s;ical
Drama,</HI> as an Entertainment known in ITALY in the Year 1490<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>MENETRIER <HI>de Repre&s;entations en
Mu&s;ique.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory traces the Ri&s;e of the <HI>Opera</HI> no farther: But a
Circum&s;tance mentioned by SULPITIUS, who was a Man of Letters, may &s;eem to
lead us up to its true Origin. He is by &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the
Inventor of this <HI>mu&s;ical Drama</HI>; but he ingenuou&s;ly tells us
him&s;elf, that he only <HI>revived</HI> it<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. We have &s;een above, that the
<HI>Tragedy</HI> of the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> was accompanied with Mu&s;ic;
that the &s;ame Union was borrowed and main|tained through the &s;everal
Periods of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire: If therefore we &s;uppo&s;e, what is
altogether probable, that the Form of the ancient Tragedy had been &s;till kept
up in &s;ome retired Part of ITALY, which the Barbarians never conquered; we
then obtain a fair Account of the Ri&s;e of the modern <HI>Opera,</HI> which
hath &s;o much con|founded all Inquiry.</P>
<P>As VENICE was the Place where the <HI>Opera</HI> fir&s;t appeared in
Splendor, &s;o it is highly probable, that <HI>there</HI> the <HI>an|cient
Tragedy</HI> had &s;lept in Ob&s;curity, during the Darkne&s;s of the Barbarous
Ages. For while the re&s;t of ITALY was over-run by the Nations from the North,
the Seas and Mora&s;&s;es of VENICE pre&s;erved <HI>Her</HI> alone from their
In|cur&s;ions: Hence, Hi&s;tory tells us, the People flocked to VENICE from
every Part of ITALY: Hence the very Form of her Republic hath been maintained
for thirteen hundred Years: And from the&s;e Views of <HI>Security,</HI> it was
natural for the helple&s;s Arts to &s;eek an A&s;ylum within 
<PB N="202" REF="205"> her Canals, from the Fury and Ignorance of a barbarous
Conqueror.</P>
<P>Other Circum&s;tances concur, to &s;trengthen this Opinion. The
<HI>Carnaval</HI> fir&s;t appeared in Splendor, and &s;till wears it at VENICE,
beyond every other Part of ITALY: Now the <HI>Carnaval</HI> is, in many
Circum&s;tances, almo&s;t a Tran&s;cript of the ancient <HI>Saturnalia</HI> of
ROME.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Venetian Comedy,</HI> the <HI>Actor</HI> wears a
<HI>Ma&s;que:</HI> A palpable <HI>Imitation,</HI> or rather
<HI>Continuance,</HI> of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>That the modern <HI>Opera</HI> is no more than a Revival of the old
<HI>Roman Tragedy,</HI> and not a new-invented Species, will appear &s;till
more evident, if we con&s;ider, that it is an Exhi|bition altogether out of
Nature, and repugnant to the univer&s;al Genius of Modern Cu&s;toms and
Manners. We have &s;een the natural Union of Poetry and Mu&s;ic, as they ri&s;e
in the &s;avage State; and how this Union forms the tragic Species in the
natural Progre&s;&s;ion of Things, Hence we have deduced the mu&s;ical
Tragedies of ancient GREECE: But in ancient ROME, it appears, they aro&s;e
merely from <HI>Imitation</HI> and <HI>Adoption.</HI> Nor could it be
otherwi&s;e; becau&s;e the <HI>Romans</HI> wanted the fir&s;t &s;eeds or
Principles from whence the mu&s;ical Tragedies of the <HI>Greeks</HI> aro&s;e.
The &s;ame Rea&s;oning takes Place, with Re&s;pect to the modern
<HI>Opera:</HI> It emerged at a Time, when the general State of Manners in
EUROPE could not naturally produce it. Had it been the Re&s;ult from
<HI>Nature,</HI> its Production would have been more <HI>general.</HI> It
emerged in that very City, where mo&s;t probably it mu&s;t have lain hid: In a
City, who&s;e other Entertainments are evidently borrowed from tho&s;e of
ancient ROME. And if to the&s;e <PB N="203" REF="206"> Arguments we add this
farther Con&s;ideration, that the Subjects of the very fir&s;t <HI>Operas</HI>
were drawn from the Fables of ancient GREECE and ROME<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">The Subjects of the fir&s;t <HI>Operas</HI> were APOLLO and
DAPHNE, ORPHEUS and EURIDICE, ALCESTES and ATYS; which la&s;t, in the Title
Page of the olde&s;t extant Edition, is called <HI>a mu&s;ical
Tragedy.</HI></NOTE>, and not from the Events or Atchievements of the Times;
and farther, that in their <HI>Form,</HI> they were exact Copies of the
<HI>ancient Drama</HI>; the&s;e accumulated Proofs amount to near a
De|mon&s;tration, that the <HI>Italian Opera</HI> is but the <HI>Revival</HI>
of the old <HI>Roman Tragedy</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">As the&s;e
Circum&s;tances prove that the <HI>modern Opera</HI> is a <HI>Revival</HI> of
the <HI>old Roman Tragedy</HI>; &s;o, we are led from hence to a probable
Con|jecture concerning the <HI>mea&s;ured Recitation</HI> of the <HI>Roman
Tragedians:</HI> And that it was &s;omething of the Nature of modern
<HI>Recitative.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such being the <HI>Birth</HI> of the modern <HI>Opera,</HI> no
Wonder it inherits the <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> of its <HI>Parent:</HI> For we have
&s;een, that the <HI>Roman Tragedy</HI> never had its proper Effects,
con&s;idered in a <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> View; having been &s;eparated from its
important Ends before its Arrival from GREECE. As therefore it had declined
into a mere <HI>Amu&s;ement</HI> when it was fir&s;t adopted by ROME; and as we
have &s;een, that in Proportion as the Roman Manners grew more di&s;&s;olute,
Tragedy &s;unk &s;till lower in its Character, till at length it became no more
than a Kind of mere <HI>Sub&s;tratum</HI> or <HI>Groundwork,</HI> on which the
Actors di&s;played their Abilities in <HI>Singing</HI> and
<HI>Ge&s;ticulation</HI>; it was altogether natural that it &s;hould ri&s;e
again in the &s;ame unnerved and effemi|nate Form.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Cau&s;es, therefore, we may trace all the Features of
the modern <HI>Opera,</HI> however <HI>unnatural</HI> and <HI>di&s;torted</HI>
they may appear. The <HI>Poem,</HI> the <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> and the 
<PB N="204" REF="207" MS="y"> <HI>Performance,</HI> as they now exi&s;t in
<HI>Union,</HI> are the manife&s;t Effects of this &s;purious Origin.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the <HI>Subject</HI> of the <HI>Poem</HI> &s;hould,
even on its fir&s;t Appearance, be drawn from Times and Countries little
intere&s;ting, and <HI>Gods</HI> and <HI>Wonders</HI> and <HI>cele&s;tial
Machinery</HI> introduced, which neither the Poet nor his Audience
<HI>believed</HI> in, could only be the Effect of a <HI>blind</HI> Principle of
<HI>Imitation,</HI> tending to mere <HI>Amu&s;ement.</HI>&mdash;The
e&s;tabli&s;hed Separation of the Poet's from the Mu&s;ician's Art was
pro|ductive of parallel Effects: For the Poet, ambitious only of &s;hining in
his particular Sphere, became generally more Intent on Imagery than Pathos: Or
el&s;e, in&s;tead of being <HI>principal,</HI> he became
<HI>&s;ub&s;ervient</HI> to the Compo&s;er's Views; from whence aro&s;e a
Motley kind of Poem (calcu|lated only for a Di&s;play of the Mu&s;ician's Art)
which degenerated by Degrees into a mere <HI>Pa&s;ticio.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; the &s;ame Cau&s;es account for all the Ab|&s;urdities of
the <HI>Mu&s;ic.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Recitative,</HI> or perpetual mu|&s;ical
Accompanyment in the declamotary Parts, is a Practice &s;o much at Variance
with modern Manners, that it extorted the following Cen&s;ure from a candid
Critic: 
<Q REND="inline">"I beg Pardon of the Inventors of the <HI>mu|&s;ical
Tragedy,</HI> a Kind of Poem, as <HI>ridiculous</HI> as it is
<HI>new.</HI>"&mdash;"If there be any thing in the World that is at Variance
with <HI>tragic Action,</HI> it is <HI>Song.</HI>" "The <HI>Opera</HI> is the
<HI>Grote&s;que</HI> of Poetry; and &s;o much the more in|tolerable, as it
pretends to pa&s;s for a regular Work<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>DACIER
<HI>Rem. &s;ur Ari&s;tote,</HI> p. 85.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Now if, along with
DACIER, we regard the <HI>Opera</HI> as a modern <HI>Invention,</HI> this
Circum&s;tance of the perpetual mu&s;ical Accompanyment is indeed
<HI>unaccountable:</HI> But if we regard it as a mere <HI>Imitation</HI> or
<HI>Continuance</HI> of the old <PB N="205" REF="208"> <HI>Roman Tragedy,</HI>
and trace <HI>this</HI> upwards to its true Foun|tain, the <HI>Greek
Drama</HI>; and again follow <HI>this</HI> to its original Source, the
<HI>&s;avage Song-Fea&s;t</HI>; we then &s;ee how naturally the&s;e
<HI>extremes unite</HI>; and di&s;cern the rude <HI>Melody</HI> and
<HI>Song</HI> of the <HI>barbarous Greek</HI> Tribes gradually melted into the
<HI>Refinements</HI> of the <HI>modern Opera.</HI>&mdash;Again, as the
Sepa|ration of the Poet's from the Mu&s;ician's Art produced an <HI>improper
Poetry</HI>; &s;o the Separation of the Mu&s;ician's from the Poet's Character
was productive of improper and <HI>unaf|fecting Mu&s;ic:</HI> For the
Compo&s;er, in his Turn, intent only on <HI>&s;hining,</HI> commonly wanders
into unmeaning Divi&s;ion, and adopts either a delicate and refined, or a
merely popular Mu&s;ic, to the Neglect of true mu&s;ical Expre&s;&s;ion. Hence,
too, the <HI>Da Capo</HI> had its natural Origin: A Practice which tends only
to tire and di&s;gu&s;t the Hearer, if he comes with an Intent of being
<HI>affected</HI> by the <HI>tragic Action,</HI> or with any other View than
that of <HI>li&s;tening</HI> to a <HI>Song</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">The
<HI>Da Capo,</HI> which is &s;o &s;triking an Ab&s;urdity in the more modern
Operas, was not u&s;ed in tho&s;e of older Date. Even COLONNA, who lived about
the middle of the &s;ixteenth Century, employed it not; as appears by one of
his Operas performed at the Academy in BOLOGNA, A. D. 1688. But in an Opera of
<HI>Old</HI> SCARLATTI (intitled <HI>La Teodora</HI>) compo&s;ed in 1693, the
<HI>Da Capo</HI> is found, though not in all his Songs. After that Period, the
U&s;e of it &s;eems to have become <HI>general:</HI> For in an Opera of
GASPARINI (intitled <HI>Il Tartaro nella China</HI>) compo&s;ed in 1715, the
<HI>Da Capo</HI> is found in every Song.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thirdly, with Regard to the <HI>Performance</HI> of the
<HI>Opera.</HI>&mdash;The theatrical Repre&s;entation is of a Piece with the
Poetry and Mu&s;ic: For, having been regarded, from its fir&s;t Ri&s;e, more as
an Affair of a&s;toni&s;hing Shew than of affecting Re|&s;emblance, it is
gaudy, flaunting, and unnatural. The Sing|ers (like the <HI>Poet</HI> and
<HI>Mu&s;ician)</HI> being con&s;idered merely as <PB N="206" REF="209">
Objects of Amu&s;ement, no Wonder if their Ambition &s;eldom reacheth higher
than to the Di&s;play of an artificial Execution.&mdash;As a Con&s;equence of
the&s;e Principles, the <HI>Ca&s;trati</HI> were introduced into all Sorts of
Characters, in &s;pite of Nature and Probability; and &s;till continue to
repre&s;ent Heroes and State&s;men, Warriours and Women.&mdash;The flouri&s;hed
Clo&s;e or Cadence aro&s;e naturally from the &s;ame Sources: From a total
Neglect of the Subject and Expre&s;&s;ion, and an Attention to the mere
Circum&s;tance of Execution only.&mdash;The frequent <HI>Encore,</HI> or Demand
of the repeated Performance of particular Songs was the natural Effect of the
&s;ame Cau&s;es. No Audience demands the <HI>Repetition</HI> of a pathetic
Speech in <HI>Tragedy,</HI> though per|formed in the fine&s;t Manner, becau&s;e
their Attention is turned on the Subject of the Drama: Thus if the Au|dience
were <HI>warmed</HI> by the <HI>Subject</HI> of an <HI>Opera,</HI> and <HI>took
Part</HI> in the main <HI>Action</HI> of the Poem, the <HI>Encore,</HI>
in&s;tead of being <HI>de&s;ireable,</HI> would generally <HI>di&s;gu&s;t:</HI>
But the whole being con&s;idered as a mere <HI>mu&s;ical Entertainment,</HI>
and the tragic <HI>Action</HI> commonly <HI>forgot,</HI> the artificial
Performance of a <HI>Song</HI> became naturally a chief Object of Admiration,
and the Repetition of it a chief <HI>Object</HI> of Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus the whole Farrago of the <HI>modern Opera</HI> &s;eems
re&s;olved into its clear and evident Principles: And hence the
<HI>Subject,</HI> the <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> the <HI>Action,</HI> the
<HI>Dre&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Execution, Decorations,</HI> and <HI>Machinery,</HI>
are &s;uch a glar|ing Compound of trifling and ab&s;urd
<HI>Improbabilities,</HI> that the <HI>tragic Influence</HI> is
<HI>overlaid</HI> and <HI>lo&s;t</HI>; nor is it po&s;&s;i|ble for any
impartial and rational Spectator to take Part in the dramatic Action, or be
<HI>moved</HI> by the <HI>ill-feigned Di&s;tre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="210" MS="y">Let not the Writer be thought to
derogate from the Ability or Merit of all the <HI>Poets, Mu&s;icians,</HI> and

<P>'Tis &s;aid, indeed, that the Weakne&s;s and Impropriety of this
Entertainment is chiefly found in foreign Countries, where the <HI>Italian</HI>
Poetry and Mu&s;ic are not <HI>native</HI>; but that in ITALY, its Power and
Influence are con&s;iderable. This the &s;en&s;ible ROUSSEAU affirms in his
Di&s;&s;ertation on the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Mu&s;ic. But
particular and well atte&s;ted Facts are &s;tubborn Things, and will not bend
to general Affirmations: And of this Fact, the concurrent Te&s;timony of all
ob&s;ervant Travellers a&s;&s;ures us; That in the <HI>Italian</HI> Theatre,
the Seats of the chief Hearers re&s;em|ble &s;o many &s;eparate Apartments,
where the Nobility &s;it retired, conver&s;ing on indifferent Subjects, and
regardle&s;s of the Progre&s;s of the Drama, till &s;ome celebrated Singer

en&s;ues a Bur&s;t of <HI>Rapture,</HI> of <HI>Bravo's, Encores,</HI> and
<HI>Applau&s;e.</HI> The Pa&s;&s;ion, therefore, thus expre&s;&s;ed on this
Occa&s;ion, is evidently the Effect, not of a true <HI>Feeling</HI> of the
<HI>Subject</HI> or tragic <HI>Action,</HI> which is entirely
<HI>di&s;regarded,</HI> but (as in the later Periods of ancient ROME) of an

<HI>Art.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The modern State of the <HI>Anthem, Motet,</HI> or
<HI>Hymn,</HI> comes next under Con&s;ideration.&mdash;With Re&s;pect to the
&s;acred Poetry that hath ever been u&s;ed in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Church,</HI>
it is various in different Countries. It appears that in ITALY, it hath been an
allowed Cu&s;tom from the earlie&s;t Ages, to permit the Admi&s;&s;ion of
<HI>Hymns</HI> or <HI>Motets</HI> as a Part of divine Service. This Practice,
in Cour&s;e of Time, produced wild and incoherent Compo&s;itions: For the
poetic Character being &s;eparated from the mu&s;ical; the
<HI>Compo&s;ers,</HI> little &s;killed in the Art of Poetry, and yet
con&s;idering them&s;elves as <HI>Principals,</HI> have often formed their
Motets of Sentiments and Pa&s;&s;ions <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent</HI> with each
other<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">For an In&s;tance of this Kind, take the
following, which is one of CARISSIMI's mo&s;t celebrated <HI>Motets:</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Peccavi, Domine, &amp; mi&s;erere mei; te diligit
Anima mea, te &s;emper quae&s;ivit Cor meum; Ergo, mi Je&s;u, mi Creator, mi

Separation here, too, en&s;ued: I mean the total Separation of <HI>Sen&s;e</HI>
from <HI>Sound:</HI> For the&s;e Motets are generally compo&s;ed in the

<P>As to the Church Mu&s;ic of ITALY and its once appendant Provinces,
it hath a&s;&s;umed a Variety of Shapes, and in different Times hath undergone
great Changes. In the &s;econd Century, it appears that the pagan Melody was

Mode&s;ty and Decorum<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>JUST. MART.

CON|STANTINOPLE by CONSTANTINE; then at ALEXAN|DRIA, by ATHANASIUS. This
E&s;tabli&s;hment was found to have bad Effects, through the effeminate Genius
of the Mu&s;ic then in Vogue, and was therefore bani&s;hed from the Church of
ALEXANDRIA. No Wonder, if it was infected with the Genius of the pagan Mu&s;ic
of the Times, which we find to have been di&s;&s;olute and ener|vate<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect. xi.</BIBL></NOTE>. From the general
Prevalence of this debauched Ta&s;te, AUGUSTINE was tempted to bani&s;h Mu&s;ic
from the Church: But AMBROSE reformed the Office of the Church of MILAN; and
e&s;tabli&s;hed a Melody au&s;tere in the Extreme: This was improved by
GREGORY; who&s;e Melody &s;ucceeded, and was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the following
Century: And now, the Deva&s;tations of the Barbarians coming on, this
<HI>Plain Song</HI> naturally lay hid unchanged in the Chri&s;tian Church,
during the &s;ucceeding Ages of Ignorance and Cruelty.</P>
<P>On the faint Revival of Arts in the eleventh Century, the Appearance
of GUIDO gave a new Genius to the Mu&s;ic of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church. For
according to the natural Tendency of his Invention of the Art of
<HI>Counterpoint,</HI> GASSENDI tells us that all the World now run mad after
an artificial Variety of Parts. About four hundred Years after GUIDO, the
debauched Art once more pa&s;&s;ed over into ITALY from GREECE: Certain
<HI>Greeks,</HI> who e&s;caped from the taking of CONSTANTINOPLE, brought a
refined and enervate &s;pecies of Mu&s;ic to ROME: Where, meeting with a
congenial Effeminacy, under the gay and di&s;&s;olute 
<PB N="210" REF="213" MS="y"> Pontificate of the Princes of the Hou&s;e of
MEDICI, it ran into &s;uch an Extreme of Indecorum, that <HI>Pope</HI> PIUS the
<HI>Fourth</HI> formed a Re&s;olution to expel it from the Church. PALAESTRINI
had the Art and Addre&s;s to divert this im|pending Storm; by compo&s;ing
&s;ome Pieces of &s;uch a maje&s;tic Gravity, as convinced the <HI>Pope</HI>
that Mu&s;ic thus truly &s;acred might be made &s;ub&s;ervient to the noble&s;t
Pur|po&s;es. This Severity of Compo&s;ition &s;till remains in the <HI>Pope's
Chapel</HI>; where, ever &s;ince the Reform la&s;t men|tioned, even mu&s;ical
In&s;truments are not admitted, for fear of creating new Abu&s;es. But the
common Genius of their modern Church Mu&s;ic or Motets is altogether
dif|ferent: It is infected with the &s;ame Puerility of Stile with their Opera
Airs: An unbounded Compa&s;s, extrava|gant Divi&s;ions on &s;ingle Syllables, a
Play upon particular Words to the Neglect of the general Tenor of the Song,
form its general Character. How can it be otherwi&s;e? When the &s;ame
Mu&s;icians, (and the&s;e &s;eldom much in|tere&s;ted in the Subject, or
acquainted with the Language of their &s;acred Poetry) generally compo&s;e both
for the <HI>Opera</HI> and the <HI>Church.</HI> Some noble Exceptions, however,
may be found to this general Remark; Of the&s;e, CARIS|SIMI is one: But the
mo&s;t eminent In&s;tance is in BENEDETTO MARCELLO a noble <HI>Venetian</HI>;
many of who&s;e P&s;alms, if we con&s;ider their Expre&s;&s;ion either as
&s;ublime, tender, graceful, or joyous, clearly excel the vocal Compo&s;itions
of all his Countrymen, in Variety, Sim|plicity, and Truth<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that MARCELLO's Compo&s;itions are not
&s;et to the <HI>Latin Tran&s;lation</HI>; but to an <HI>Italian
Paraphra&s;e</HI> of the P&s;alms.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With Re&s;pect to the <HI>Performance</HI> of their Church Mu&s;ic
in ITALY, it hath naturally too much followed the Genius 
<PB N="211" REF="214" MS="y"> of the Art it&s;elf. They have no e&s;tabli&s;hed
Choirs of Prie&s;ts: The <HI>Ca&s;trati</HI> are the chief Singers in the
Church: In ROME, the&s;e Performers go round the City in Bands, as they are
accidentally hired; and bring no great Credit to the &s;acred Mu&s;ic, either
by their Cha|racters or per&s;onal Appearance. The Truth is, Church Mu&s;ic, in
ITALY, like that of the <HI>Opera,</HI> is con&s;idered more as a Matter of
Amu&s;ement than Devotion. Hence the Decorations and mu&s;ical Exhibitions of
their <HI>Churches,</HI> in the Time of <HI>Carnaval,</HI> approach towards
tho&s;e of the <HI>Theatre</HI> at an <HI>Opera:</HI> And the general Attention
is &s;o far from being turned on &s;acred Subjects, that it is chiefly
exerci&s;ed in <HI>Debates</HI> and <HI>Quarrels</HI> about the
<HI>Excellence</HI> and <HI>Superiority</HI> of the performing
<HI>Ca&s;trati.</HI></P>
<P>Such then have been the <HI>Separations</HI> and
<HI>Progre&s;&s;ions</HI> of <HI>&s;acred Poetry</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> in
the <HI>Mother</HI> Country, from whence they have been chiefly derived and
tran&s;mitted to the re&s;t of EUROPE. However, as they wear an A&s;pect
&s;omewhat different in FRANCE and ENGLAND, it may be proper to point out the
chief Variations, together with the Cau&s;es that have produced them.</P>
<P>In FRANCE the &s;acred Poetry of their <HI>Motets</HI> or
<HI>Hymns</HI> is, in its general Turn, much &s;uperior to that of ITALY: For
in FRANCE it is mo&s;t commonly &s;elected and borrowed, if not tran&s;cribed,
from the <HI>&s;acred Writings.</HI> This in&s;ures to it a con&s;iderable
Degree of Propriety, Dignity, and Force. How this came to pa&s;s, we may learn
from an Authority no le&s;s than that of the great COLBERT; who, in his
political Te&s;tament, acknowledges this among other Obli|gations which the
Church of FRANCE hath owed to their Intercour&s;e with the
<HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> that it hath given them a <PB N="212" REF="215" MS="y">
more general and intimate Acquaintance with the holy Scriptures.&mdash;Their
&s;acred Mu&s;ic, though not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that Grace which the be&s;t
Italian may truly boa&s;t, yet it may be ju&s;tly regarded as the be&s;t that
FRANCE hath pro|duced; becau&s;e it is &s;et to a much better mu&s;ical
Language than their own: For the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue hath a Variety of Accent
and Mea&s;ure, which adapts it&s;elf happily to mu&s;ical Expre&s;&s;ion;
whereas the <HI>French</HI> Language is hoar&s;e, ill-accented, or of ambiguous
Accent, void of Har|mony and Variety, and incurably di&s;cordant: But &s;till,
the Compo&s;ition of their <HI>Motets</HI> in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue is
at|tended with the &s;ame ab&s;urd Con&s;equence as in ITALY, that the People
in general do not under&s;tand them.&mdash;In one Re&s;pect, however, their
&s;acred Mu&s;ic hath not de|parted from its proper Character &s;o far as the
modern <HI>Italian</HI>; I mean, in its Gravity of Stile: And this, it &s;eems
probable, hath been owing in Part to take e&s;tabli&s;hed Choirs in FRANCE,
which are compo&s;ed of regular <HI>Eccle|&s;ia&s;tics,</HI> and therefore not
&s;o ea&s;ily &s;educed to adopt a light and flaunting Species of Mu&s;ic, as
the wandering Bands of <HI>Italian Ca&s;trati.</HI> Another concomitant Cau&s;e
of this re&s;erved and &s;ober Mu&s;ic may probably have been the Mixture of
the Prote&s;tant Party in FRANCE: For the&s;e (according to the Genius of every
new-reformed Sect) adopted a grave and &s;imple Melody: They were therefore a
&s;alutary Check upon the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, tending to the Prevention of
open and &s;candalous Abu&s;es.&mdash;La&s;tly, with Regard to the Article of
<HI>Performance,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> have greatly the Advantage in Point
of Propriety and Decorum; for, as we have ob&s;erved, their Choirs are
com|po&s;ed of an e&s;tabli&s;hed Prie&s;thood, who attend to this 
<PB N="213" REF="216" MS="y"> peculiar Profe&s;&s;ion; who&s;e Characters are
of higher Con|&s;ideration than tho&s;e of the <HI>Italian</HI> Bands; and
who&s;e Learning, as well as Religion and Manners, naturally lead them to a
more reverent and devout Execution of their &s;acred Office.</P>
<P>In ENGLAND the State of Things is in &s;ome Re&s;pects better, and
in &s;ome Re&s;pects wor&s;e than in FRANCE. Our &s;acred Poetry, &s;ung in the
<HI>Cathedrals,</HI> is tran&s;cribed &s;trictly from the <HI>holy
Scriptures,</HI> and mo&s;t commonly from the Book of P&s;alms: Except only the
<HI>Te Deum,</HI> which is one of the mo&s;t ancient and approved Hymns of the
Church. This Re&s;triction, by which no Hymns of new Invention are admitted as
a Part of divine Service, we owe to the grand Reformation: This opened to us
the Foun|tain of the &s;acred Writings, which had before been locked up, as in
ITALY. From the &s;ame Cau&s;e, our <HI>Anthems</HI> are likewi&s;e given in
our own Tongue; which though not &s;o various as the <HI>Latin,</HI> is yet
generally round and &s;onorous, clearly accented, and capable of being adapted
to a Variety of mu&s;ical Expre&s;&s;ion. But while we ju&s;tly ad|mire the
<HI>&s;acred Poetry</HI> of our <HI>Cathedral</HI> Service, mu&s;t we not
lament the State of it in our <HI>parochial</HI> Churches, where the cold, the
meagre, the di&s;gu&s;ting <HI>Dulne&s;s</HI> of STERNHOLD and his
<HI>Companions,</HI> hath <HI>quenched</HI> all the <HI>poetic Fire</HI> and
<HI>devout Maje&s;ty</HI> of the <HI>royal P&s;almi&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The Character of our <HI>Cathedral Mu&s;ic</HI> is of a
<HI>middle</HI> Kind: Not of the fir&s;t Rank in the great Quality of
<HI>Ex|pre&s;&s;ion</HI>; nor yet &s;o improper or ab&s;urd, as to de&s;erve a
ge|neral Reprobation. Too &s;tudious a Regard to <HI>Fugues</HI> and an
artificial <HI>Counterpoint</HI> appears in the <HI>old,</HI> and too
<HI>airy</HI> and <HI>light</HI> a Turn, to the Neglect of a grand Simpli|city,
<PB N="214" REF="217" MS="y"> in the <HI>new:</HI> Two Extremes which tend
equally, though from oppo&s;ite Cau&s;es, to de&s;troy <HI>mu&s;ical
Expre&s;|&s;ion</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>For a full View of this
Subject, &s;ee Mr. AVISON's <HI>E&s;&s;ay on mu&s;ical
Expre&s;&s;ion.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. Yet, there are Pa&s;&s;ages in PURCEL's
Anthems, which may fairly &s;tand in Competition with tho&s;e of any
Compo&s;er, of whatever Country. There are others who may ju&s;tly claim a
con&s;iderable Share of Prai&s;e. HANDEL &s;tands eminent, in his Greatne&s;s
and Sublimity of Style.&mdash;Our <HI>parochial Mu&s;ic,</HI> in general, is
&s;olemn and devout: Much better calculated for the Performance of a whole
Congregation, than if it were more broken and elaborate. In Country Churches,
wherever a more artificial Kind hath been imprudently attempted, Confu&s;ion
and Di&s;&s;on|ance are the general Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Performance</HI> of our Cathedral Mu&s;ic is defective: We
have no grand e&s;tabli&s;hed Choirs of Prie&s;ts, as in FRANCE; who&s;e
Dignity of Character might in a proper Degree maintain That of the divine
Service. This Duty is chiefly left to a Band of <HI>Lay-Singers,</HI> who&s;e
Rank and Education are not of Weight to pre&s;erve their Profe&s;&s;ion from
Contempt. The Performance of our parochial P&s;alms, though in the Villages it
be often as mean and meagre as the Words that are &s;ung; yet in great Towns,
where a good Organ is &s;kilfully and devoutly employed by a &s;en&s;ible
Organi&s;t, the Union of this In&s;trument with the Voices of a
well-in&s;tructed Congregation, forms one of the grande&s;t Scenes of
unaffected Piety that human Nature can afford. The Rever&s;e of this appears,
when a Com|pany of illiterate People form them&s;elves into a <HI>Choir</HI>
di&s;tinct from the Congregation. Here Devotion is lo&s;t, 
<PB N="215" REF="218" MS="y"> between the impotent <HI>Vanity</HI> of tho&s;e
who <HI>&s;ing,</HI> and the ignorant <HI>Wonder</HI> of tho&s;e who
<HI>li&s;ten.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Oratorio</HI> is a <HI>dramatic
Repre&s;entation</HI> of &s;ome Story taken from the &s;acred Scriptures, or
the Records of the Church, accompanied with Mu&s;ic. Its Origin is at|tributed
to the barbarous Period of the <HI>Croi&s;ades</HI>; when Companies of
<HI>Pilgrims,</HI> returning from JERUSALEM, formed them&s;elves into
<HI>Choirs,</HI> and &s;ung the Prai&s;es and Atchievements of Saints and
Martyrs<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>MENETRIER <HI>des Repre&s;ent. en
Mu&s;ique.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. Thus it is &s;aid to have ari&s;en and been
e&s;tabli&s;hed in FRANCE. But how it could a&s;&s;ume the Form of <HI>dramatic
Repre&s;entation accompanied with Mu&s;ic,</HI> is hard to &s;ay, without
&s;uppo&s;ing it (like the <HI>Opera)</HI> to have been the Effect of an
<HI>Imitation.</HI> On this principle we may trace it to a probable Origin. It
is well known, that the Pagan Shews were often ex|hibited in the Temples, or at
the Tombs of decea&s;ed Heroes: 'Tis no le&s;s certain, that the early
Chri&s;tians adopted the Practice, with a due Change of Objects, either from a
mere Imitation of the Pagan Cu&s;tom, or with a View to the Conver&s;ion of
Idolators. Nothing, therefore, could be more natural, than that the mu&s;ical
Accompanyment &s;hould remain, though the Objects were changed. Of this Mode of
Piety we have a clear In&s;tance in a Di&s;cour&s;e of AUGUSTINE, who condemned
the Practice; where, &s;peaking of CYPRIAN's Tomb, he &s;ays, 
<Q REND="inline">"Not many Years ago, the Petulance of the Dancers
had invaded this &s;acred Place, where the Martyr's Body is laid: All Night

Ge&s;ticulations<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>AUG. <HI>Serm. in nat. Divi</HI>

&s;uppo&s;ing this Practice to have &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in &s;ome remote or
ob&s;cure Part of ASIA or GREECE, it might na|turally be adopted by Companies
of devout Pilgrims, in their Peregrinations to the holy Land: And thus the
&s;a|cred mu&s;ical Drama would be <HI>naturally produced.</HI></P>
<P>In ITALY the Origin of the <HI>Oratorio</HI> is &s;aid to have been
more recent, and clearly the Effect of an Imitation. We are told, that the
famous PHILIP DE NERY, a Na|tive of FLORENCE, and Founder of the Congregation
of the Prie&s;ts of the <HI>Oratory</HI> in the Year 1540, ob&s;erving the
&s;trong Pa&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Roman</HI> People for <HI>mu&s;ical
Repre&s;ent|ations,</HI> invented the <HI>&s;acred Drama,</HI> with a View to
their Improvement in Piety. Hence it is &s;aid to have received the Name of
<HI>Oratorio,</HI> which it &s;till wears. The <HI>Opera,</HI> already
e&s;tabli&s;hed at VENICE and ROME, was his Model: He had little more to do,
than to change the Objects from <HI>Pagan</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;tian:</HI> And
thus from ITALY it &s;pread into other Parts of EUROPE<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>BOURDELOT <HI>Hi&s;t. de la Mu&s;ique,</HI> tom. i. p.
256.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The capital Impropriety and Defect of this Entertain|ment, while it
wears the <HI>dramatic</HI> Form, is the perpetual Recitative or mu&s;ical
Accompanyment in the interlocutory Parts, &s;imilar to that of the
<HI>Opera.</HI> This is a Circum|&s;tance &s;o repugnant to modern Manners, and
therefore &s;o far out of Nature, that no Audience can be much affected by the
Repre&s;entation, or take Part in an Action &s;o impro|bably feigned. The
nece&s;&s;ary Effect of This glaring Im|probability is a general Inattention to
the <HI>Subject,</HI> and a Regard centered chiefly on the <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> and
<HI>Execution.</HI></P>
<P>Of this Species of <HI>Poem</HI> the <HI>Italians</HI> have &s;ome
fine ones, written by METASTASIO. They cannot perhaps be rank|ed 
<PB N="217" REF="222"> in the fir&s;t Cla&s;s, either for Sublimity or Pathos.
But Elegance of Style, Simplicity of Plan and Conduct, ani|mated by a noble
Spirit of Devotion, prevails throughout the&s;e Compo&s;itions. The
<HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> of the <HI>Oratorio</HI> in ITALY too much re&s;embles That of
the <HI>Opera:</HI> Simplicity, Ma|je&s;ty, and devout Expre&s;&s;ion, are
&s;acrificed to the Com|po&s;er's Vanity or ill-directed Art.</P>
<P>The <HI>Performance</HI> of this <HI>&s;acred Drama</HI> in ITALY is
&s;aid to be attended with many of the &s;ame Circum&s;tances of Impropriety
with that of the <HI>Opera,</HI> from which it had its Origin: All tending to
render it rather a Subject of mere Amu&s;ement, than of Piety and Virtue. Add
to this, that being performed in the Churches, it may be que&s;tioned whether
the Drama be dignified, or the Temple prophaned, by &s;o inadequate a
Repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>In FRANCE, I do not find the <HI>Oratorio</HI> is now in U&s;e: Its
fir&s;t rude Form produced <HI>Comedy</HI> and <HI>Tragedy</HI> in that
Kingdom: But the Parent &s;eems to have died at their Birth<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>BOILEAU, <HI>Art Poet.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In ENGLAND, this <HI>&s;acred Drama</HI> is in &s;ome Re&s;pects
<HI>well,</HI> in others, <HI>ill</HI> conducted. Next to the perpetual
mu&s;ical Accompanyment, the leading Impropriety hath ari&s;en from an entire
<HI>Separation</HI> of the <HI>Poet's</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;ician's Office.</HI>
Even when the <HI>Poet</HI> remains <HI>principal,</HI> this Sepa|ration tends
to bad Effects: But to compleat the Evil, the <HI>Mu&s;ician's</HI> Character
hath here, in many In&s;tances, a&s;&s;umed the <HI>Precedence</HI>; and the
<HI>Poet</HI> become <HI>&s;ub&s;ervient</HI> to him, as his <HI>Director.</HI>
How this came to pa&s;s, may be ea&s;ily explained. This Kind of Poem being
unknown in ENG|LAND <PB N="218" REF="223" MS="y"> when HANDEL arrived; and that
great Mu&s;ician being the fir&s;t who introduced the <HI>Oratorio</HI>; it
became a Matter of Nece&s;&s;ity, that he &s;hould <HI>employ</HI> &s;ome
Writer in his Service. Now this being a Degradation, to which Men of Genius
would not ea&s;ily &s;ubmit, he was forced to apply to <HI>Ver&s;ifiers</HI>
in&s;tead of <HI>Poets.</HI> Thus the Poem was the Effect either of Hire or
Favour, when it ought to have been the voluntary Emanation of Genius. Hence,
mo&s;t of the Poems he compo&s;ed to, are &s;uch, as would have &s;unk and
di&s;graced any other Mu&s;ic than his own.</P>
<P>But although his exalted Genius bore it&s;elf up again&s;t this
Weight of Dulne&s;s; yet &s;uch a leading Defect could not fail to have
e&s;&s;ential Effects on the Mu&s;ician's Art. For although no Man ever
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed greater Powers of mu&s;ical Expre&s;&s;ion; yet, when the
Writer gave him &s;ome|times little, and &s;ometimes nothing to expre&s;s, the
main Foundation of his Art failed him: He was in the Situation of a great
Painter, who &s;hould be de&s;tined to give Life by Colours, to a dead and
unmeaning De&s;ign<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The MESSIAH is an Exception to this
general Remark: Though that grand Mu&s;ical Entertainment is called an
<HI>Oratorio,</HI> yet it is not <HI>dramatic</HI>; but properly a Collection
of <HI>Hymns</HI> or <HI>Anthems</HI> drawn from the &s;acred Scriptures: In
&s;trict Propriety, therefore, it falls under another Cla&s;s of Compo&s;ition,
which we have already con&s;idered.&mdash;The <HI>Oratorio</HI> of SAMSON is
properly <HI>dramatic:</HI> But the Poem is &s;o much changed in the Attempt
towards accommodating it to Mu&s;ic, that it can hardly be regarded as the Work
of MILTON.&mdash;The L'ALLEGRO and IL PENSEROSO are two elegant Poems; and are
finely &s;et to Mu&s;ic by HANDEL: But being merely <HI>de&s;criptive,</HI> and
in no Degree <HI>pathetic,</HI> they cannot be ranked among the highe&s;t Forms
of Poetry; nor could they give Play to his highe&s;t Powers of
Expre&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>. Nay, even where any Degree of poetical Expre&s;&s;ion
happened to give Play to his expre&s;&s;ive Powers, yet &s;till, the general 
<PB N="219" REF="224" MS="y"> Compo&s;ition being unconnected, weak, and
unaffecting, there could be neither Contra&s;t nor Succe&s;&s;ion of pathetic
Songs and Choirs; which, when properly united in one great Subject, heighten
each other by a continued Pro|gre&s;&s;ion, like the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Scenes of
a <HI>well-plan'd Tragedy.</HI> Had HANDEL's Airs and Choirs been compo&s;ed in
this connected Manner, and the Probability of the Repre&s;en|tation in other
Re&s;pects pre&s;erved, their Effect had been proportionable. At pre&s;ent,
being often disjoined, and deprived of that Connexion which ought to ari&s;e
from the Poet's Art, they lo&s;e all the Force which an Accumulation of
Pa&s;&s;ion would have produced. They &s;tand &s;ingle: While in a
well-conducted Poem, the Effect of every <HI>&s;uc|ceeding</HI> Song or Choir
would be heightened by the Power of the <HI>preceding.</HI></P>
<P>But while we pay all due Regard to the Memory of this great
Mu&s;ician, and acknowledge, nay maintain, that his Compo&s;itions often
ari&s;e to the highe&s;t Pitch of <HI>Sublimity</HI> and <HI>Pathos</HI>;
critical Ju&s;tice demands &s;ome farther Remarks on this Subject, for the Sake
of future Arti&s;ts.&mdash;As a nece&s;|&s;ary Con&s;equence, therefore, of the
<HI>Separation</HI> of the <HI>Poet's</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;ician's</HI> Province,
and of his too great At|tention to the <HI>latter</HI>; his Mu&s;ic is
&s;ometimes improperly conducted, even where it is not influenced by the
Defects of the Poem. From this Separation, in which he only complied with the
e&s;tabli&s;hed Practice of the Times, the following incidental Defects
naturally aro&s;e. 1. Too much mu&s;ical Divi&s;ion upon &s;ingle Syllables, to
the Neglect of the Sen&s;e and Meaning of the Song.&mdash;2. A partial
Imitation of incidental Words, in&s;tead of a proper Expre&s;&s;ion of the
ruling Sentiments; even when &s;uch Words and Sentiments happen to be con|trary
<PB N="220" REF="225" MS="y"> to each other.&mdash;3. Solo Songs often too much
lengthened, without the Intervention of the Choir, to in|&s;pirit and
&s;u&s;tain them: E&s;pecially the <HI>Da Capo</HI> is almo&s;t in every
In&s;tance of bad Effect, as it renders the fir&s;t and capital Part of the
Song <HI>in&s;ipid</HI> by an <HI>unmeaning Repeti|tion.</HI>&mdash;4. Choirs
&s;ometimes too much lengthened, without the Intervention of &s;ingle Songs or
Duets, for the nece&s;&s;ary Repo&s;e of the Ear, which is apt to be fatigued
and di&s;|gu&s;ted by &s;uch a long-continued and forcible
Impre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;5. Choirs &s;ometimes (though &s;eldom) calculated more
for the Di&s;play of the Compo&s;er's Art, in the Con&s;truction of
<HI>Fugues</HI> and <HI>Canons,</HI> than for a natural Expre&s;&s;ion of the
Subject.&mdash;6. The <HI>Choir</HI> in <HI>many</HI> In&s;tances (and the
<HI>&s;ingle Song,</HI> in <HI>&s;ome)</HI> not <HI>&s;udden</HI> enough in its
Intervention; being generally <HI>prepared</HI> by a corre&s;pondent Symphony
of in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic; which creates Expectation and Pre|&s;entiment,
de&s;troys Surprize, and thus <HI>le&s;&s;ens</HI> the <HI>Impre&s;&s;ion</HI>
and <HI>Effect.</HI></P>
<P>In&s;tances might be produced of all the&s;e Defects, in the
Compo&s;itions of this great Ma&s;ter: But they aro&s;e not &s;o much from
Him&s;elf, as from the Period in which he lived. Therefore the Writer chu&s;eth
to ca&s;t them into Shades, refering them to the Ob&s;ervation and Regard of

<P>The <HI>Poet's</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;ician's</HI> Office cannot probably
be again united in their full and general Power. For in their pre&s;ent refined
State, either of their Arts &s;eparately con|&s;idered, is of &s;uch
<HI>Extent,</HI> that although they may inci|dentally meet in one Per&s;on,
they cannot often be found together.&mdash;One Expedient there is, indeed, by
which the two Arts may be practically united by the &s;ame Per&s;on. That is,
if the <HI>Poet</HI> &s;elect and adapt proper <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> to his Poem; or
the <HI>Mu&s;ician</HI> &s;elect and adapt proper <HI>Poetry</HI> to his
Mu&s;ic. Let us then con&s;ider, which of the&s;e Methods is mo&s;t likely to
&s;ucceed, in uniting the two Arts <HI>effectually.</HI> Now, though we
&s;uppo&s;e the Mu&s;ician to be of &s;ufficient Ability to di&s;tingui&s;h
<HI>good</HI> Poetry from <HI>bad</HI>; we mu&s;t farther ob&s;erve, that to
collect various Pa&s;&s;ages from vari|ous Poets, and form them into one
<HI>whole</HI> with Propriety and Force, would be a Ta&s;k difficult, if not
impo&s;&s;ible: For the Expre&s;&s;ions of Poetry are <HI>particular,</HI> and
un|alterably <HI>appropriated</HI> to their Subject: They are therefore
generally incapable of a &s;econd Application. The Fact is quite otherwi&s;e in
Mu&s;ic: For here, the Expre&s;&s;ions are <HI>general</HI> and <HI>vague:</HI>
it is the <HI>Poetry</HI> to which they are applied, which fixeth and gives
them their <HI>particular Ex|pre&s;&s;ion.</HI> <PB N="224" REF="231">
Therefore, a Selection of various Pieces may be made, and united in one
<HI>whole,</HI> with Propriety and Effect. This Union is indeed &s;ometimes
made in an unmeaning Way, in what the <HI>Italians</HI> call a
<HI>Pa&s;ticio:</HI> Where we commonly &s;ee a Series of Songs thrown together,
without Connexion or De&s;ign. But if we &s;uppo&s;e a Poem properly conducted,
and adapted to Mu&s;ic of the fir&s;t Excellence, in Sub&s;erviency to the
Genius of the Poem; 'tis plain, that the Mu&s;ic &s;o applied may acquire a
Force of Expre&s;&s;ion more powerful in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Application than
in the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI> As (to re&s;ume a former Allu&s;ion) the &s;ame Kind
of <HI>Colours</HI> may acquire a &s;tronger Effect, by being employed on a
<HI>forcible</HI> than an <HI>in&s;ipid Drawing.</HI> This is an <HI>Union</HI>
far ea&s;ier to <HI>attempt,</HI> than to <HI>accompli&s;h.</HI> However; thus
much it &s;eemed proper to remark, le&s;t every Endeavour of this Kind &s;hould
be regarded as a mere <HI>Pa&s;ticio.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Singer's</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion can &s;eldom be united with
that of the <HI>Poet,</HI> and not generally with that of the
<HI>Mu&s;ician.</HI> The &s;ame Cau&s;e will maintain the Separation here, as
in the poetic and mu&s;ical Profe&s;&s;ions. The Arts, in their pre&s;ent
refined and complicated State, &s;eparately demand &s;uch continued Application
and various Qualities, as &s;eldom meet in the &s;ame Per&s;on.&mdash;'Tis the
Performer's Province, therefore, in this State of Separation, to conform to the
Genius of the <HI>Poem</HI> and the <HI>Mu&s;ic.</HI> As the Mu&s;ician is
&s;ubordinate to the Poet, &s;o the Performer is &s;ubordinate to
<HI>Both.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Epic</HI> Poem cannot be again united with <HI>Mu&s;ic.</HI>
The Rea&s;ons may be collected from the preceding Parts of this
Di&s;&s;ertation. The long Narrations, the frequent Dialogue, the Mixture of
calm De&s;cription and unim|pa&s;&s;ioned <PB N="225" REF="232"> Sentiment, all
the&s;e are clearly incompatible with the mu&s;ical Alliance, unle&s;s where
long-continued Cu&s;tom, and a Pre-E&s;tabli&s;hment drawn from &s;avage
Manners, had produced and confirmed an Union. But this, once broken, can never
be effectually re&s;tored: For it mu&s;t ever want that Foundation of
<HI>Habit,</HI> on which it fir&s;t aro&s;e, and gain|ed its Power<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect. vi. Art. 10.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tragic</HI> Poem can never again be powerfully united with
Mu&s;ic. This repugnance ari&s;eth from the &s;ame Cau&s;e with the la&s;t. For
here, the continued mu&s;ical Accompanyment, mixing it&s;elf with the dramatic
Cha|racter and the perpetual Dialogue, forms a <HI>whole</HI> &s;o
incom|patible with modern Manners, and &s;o far out of known Nature, as
de&s;troys that Probability which is the fir&s;t Foundation of a true
Pathos.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ode,</HI> or <HI>hymnal</HI> Species, may be again properly
and forcibly united with <HI>Mu&s;ic.</HI> We have already &s;een the
Foundation on which this Species is more univer&s;ally al|lied with Melody than
any other<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Sect. vi. Art. 17.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
great Mean of their powerful Union mu&s;t be a pathetic and corre&s;pondent
Simplicity of Compo&s;ition in Both.&mdash;With Re&s;pect to the pathetic
Simplicity of the <HI>Ode</HI>; although the ob&s;cure, the learned, the cold,
the florid, the wordy, the amu&s;ing Style, hath been too generally adopted by
the Moderns; yet this fal&s;e Manner is not &s;o &s;trongly e&s;tabli&s;hed, as
to preclude all Po&s;&s;ibility of a general Reform: For we find, that where
the Poem is written in the &s;imple, intelligible, and pathetic Form, it is
more generally approved (except only by <HI>mere Scholars</HI> who are ignorant
of Nature) than <PB N="226" REF="233" MS="y"> the oppo&s;ite Manner of fal&s;e
Refinement. In Proof of this, we need only alledge the two noble Odes of POPE
and DRYDEN; which the world in general under&s;tand, feel, and admire.</P>
<P>A <HI>&s;imple</HI> and <HI>pathetic Melody</HI> may be no le&s;s
&s;ucce&s;sfully adopted, and applied to Poetry. This is evident, from the
incidental and frequent Practice of the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters. HANDEL, MARCELLO,
BONONCINI, CORELLI, GEMI|NIANI, and their be&s;t Di&s;ciples, are often
admirable in the pathetic Simplicity of Song: More e&s;pecially they are &s;o,
when they are fortunate enough to forget the O&s;tenta|tion and Parade of Art.
The Succe&s;s is an&s;werable to their De&s;ert: For this Simplicity of Style
is admired be|yond the artificial, by <HI>All,</HI> except only a <HI>Few,</HI>
who&s;e Ta&s;te (like that of the mere <HI>Scholar-Tribe)</HI> is debauched by
their own fal&s;e Refinements<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>Here it may be proper to point out, on what Foundation a
<HI>&s;imple Melody</HI> is more <HI>pathetic</HI> than a <HI>complex</HI> and
<HI>artificial.</HI> 1. In the Expre&s;&s;ion of the Pa&s;&s;ions, Nature doth
not offer mu&s;ical Sounds to the human Ear. For though the natural Tones of
<HI>Grief</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> (the two Pa&s;&s;ions which are mo&s;t
effectually expre&s;&s;ed by Mu&s;ic) approach nearer to mu&s;ical Preci&s;ion
than any other, yet &s;till they are in a certain Degree inconcinnous and
unmu&s;ical. 2. As the Tones of the Pa&s;&s;ions are in &s;ome Degree
unmu&s;ical, &s;o are they generally more &s;imple in their Compo&s;ition or
Succe&s;&s;ion, than the Tones which are commonly employed to form a regular
Melody. From the fir&s;t of the&s;e Remarks it follows, that all mu&s;ical
Expre&s;&s;ion of the Pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be <HI>imperfect:</HI> For the
mu&s;ical Sounds not being found in Nature, if the Arti&s;t &s;trictly imitates
the Sounds he hears, they will be un|mu&s;ical; if he varies from Nature, &s;o
as to make them mu&s;ical, the Imitation will be defective. Yet Imagination
hath a Power of im|po&s;ing its impre&s;&s;ions on Rea&s;on, in a certain
Degree. This we find at the proper Repre&s;entation of a Tragedy; where, though
the Scenery, the Per&s;ons, the Dre&s;&s;es, the Compo&s;ition, and other
accompanying Ob|jects, are not a preci&s;e Tran&s;cript from Nature, that is,
though the Imi|tation be defective, yet &s;till it is highly affecting: But if
the Repre&s;entation departs from Nature beyond a certain Degree, Rea&s;on then
revolts, and the affecting Power is lo&s;t: And thus mu&s;ical Imitation,
though imperfect in a certain Degree, &s;till boa&s;ts its Power: If imperfect
<HI>beyond</HI> a certain Degree, its affecting Power is lo&s;t. But as it
follows from the &s;econd Re|mark, that the farther mu&s;ical Sounds depart
from <HI>Simplicity,</HI> the farther they depart from <HI>Nature</HI>; &s;o,
the Con&s;equence is clear, that a <HI>&s;imple Melody</HI> (though an
imperfect Imitation) may be <HI>pathetic</HI>; while a <HI>complex</HI> and
<HI>artificial</HI> Melody (by departing from Nature beyond a certain Degree)
will entirely <HI>lo&s;e</HI> its <HI>affecting Power.</HI></P> 
<P>This naturally leads to the Con&s;ideration of a my&s;terious
Circum&s;tance, which lies yet unaccounted for, at the very Foundation of
mu&s;ical Ex|pre&s;&s;ion. The Fact is this; that 
<Q REND="inline">"mu&s;ical Sounds which are employed to
expre&s;s Pa&s;&s;ions (as Grief or Joy) by an <HI>imperfect Imitation,</HI>
are often <HI>more affecting</HI> than the <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>perfect
Voice</HI> of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, when given without mu&s;ical
Intonations."</Q>&mdash;It &s;eems not ea&s;y to a&s;&s;ign a clear and
&s;ufficient Cau&s;e for this Appearance. Let the following Conjectures have
what Weight they may.&mdash;1. Have not mu&s;ical Sounds a mechanical Power
over the human Frame, by which they awaken it into a higher Degree of
<HI>Sen&s;ibility</HI> and <HI>Sympathy,</HI> than it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth in its
more <HI>cool</HI> and <HI>torpid</HI> State?&mdash;2. Are we not generally
&s;o con&s;tituted, as to &s;ympathize much more &s;trongly with tho&s;e in
whom we find amiable Qualities, than their Oppo&s;ites? And as Pity melts the
Soul to Love, &s;o doth not Love melt the Soul to Pity?&mdash;3. Doth not a
<HI>&s;weet Voice,</HI> like a <HI>fine Countenance,</HI> create a &s;trong
<HI>Prejudice</HI> in <HI>Favour</HI> of its <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or,</HI> and
induce a <HI>Belief</HI> of <HI>amiable</HI> inherent
<HI>Qualities?</HI>&mdash;4. May not the Voice and Figure of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
or joyous Object be &s;o horrid or uncouth, ridiculous or ugly, as in a great
Mea&s;ure to le&s;&s;en, if not totally to de&s;troy the Sympathy of tho&s;e
who hear and &s;ee it?&mdash;If the&s;e Ob&s;ervations be true, then by
carrying the Voices or Expre&s;&s;ions of Grief or Joy into &s;weeter Tones and
higher Degrees of Melody than they po&s;&s;e&s;s in Nature, yet &s;till
pre&s;erving the Re&s;emblance &s;o far as not to de&s;troy Probability, may we
not, on the Principles here given, create a higher Degree of Affection and
Sympathy, than the natural Voice of the Pa&s;&s;ions can give?</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="234">Yet there is one Circum&s;tance, in which
modern Poetry and Mu&s;ic, though both reduced to their full Simplicity, cannot
obtain that perfect Union which they held in an|cient GREECE. The Numbers of
the Poem and the Mea|&s;ure <PB N="228" REF="235"> of the Mu&s;ic will
inevitably &s;ometimes cla&s;h. That Variety of Feet with which the Greek
Tongue abound|ed, gave &s;uch Play to the Mu&s;ician's Art, in adapting a
<HI>various</HI> and <HI>corre&s;pondent Melody,</HI> as no living Language can

event is rather to be wi&s;hed than hoped for. In&s;tead, therefore, of urging

in Sub&s;erviency to the &s;acred Poetry, ought to be aimed at, as the
true&s;t, and the only Prai&s;e. The &s;ame devout Simplicity of Manner may be
attained in the Performance, and ought to be &s;tudied by the Organi&s;t and
<HI>Choir:</HI> Their Ambition &s;hould lie in a natural and dignified
Execution, not in a curious Di&s;play of Art. The Maxim of AUGUSTINE was
excellent, and de&s;erves the &s;erious Attention both of tho&s;e who perform,
and tho&s;e who hear: 
<Q REND="inline">"I always think my&s;elf blameable, when I am drawn
to attend more to the <HI>Singer</HI> than to <HI>what is Sung.</HI>"</Q> But
an additional Circum&s;tance &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, as a Means of bringing back
Church Mu&s;ic to its original Dignity and U&s;e: We have &s;een, in the
Cour&s;e of this Di&s;&s;ertation, how the Separations follow each other in the
Decline of the poetic and mu&s;ical Arts. And for the &s;ake of Truth, we
mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that in the Per|formance of Cathedral Mu&s;ic, a
Separation hath long taken Place, fatal to its true Utility. The higher Ranks
of the Church do not think them&s;elves concerned in the Per|formance. It were
devoutly to be wi&s;hed, that the mu&s;ical Education were &s;o general, as to
enable the Clergy, of whatever Rank, to join the Choir in the Celebration of 
<PB N="232" REF="239"> their Creator, in all its appointed Forms: The Laity
would be naturally led to follow &s;o powerful an Exam|ple.&mdash;There is
Rea&s;on to believe, that this Separation was in Part occa&s;ioned by the
Introduction of an artificial Mu&s;ic, which became too difficult in the
Execution for any but profe&s;&s;ed Mu&s;icians: Here, then, we find an
ad|ditional Motive, for bringing down the Cathedral Mu&s;ic from its pre&s;ent
complex and artificial Style, to that of Simplicity and ea&s;y Execution.</P>
<P N="3">3. With Re&s;pect to the two dramatic Forms, the
<HI>Opera</HI> and <HI>Oratorio,</HI> we have already pointed out their chief
Defects, as they exi&s;t in their pre&s;ent State. But as to an effectual
Reformation, &s;uch as may produce their proper <HI>Ends,</HI> it &s;eems
utterly impracticable, while the <HI>dra|matic Form</HI> and the <HI>mu&s;ical
Accompanyment</HI> remain in <HI>Union.</HI> To hear Kings, Warriours,
State&s;men, Philo|&s;ophers, Patriarchs, Saints, and Martyrs, holding long
Conver&s;ations with each other in mu&s;ical Recitative, is a Circum&s;tance
&s;o totally out of Nature, that the Imagin|ation immediately revolts, and
rejects the Repre&s;entation as ab&s;urd and incredible. The
<HI>Recitative,</HI> therefore, or perpetual mu&s;ical Accompanyment which
prevails in both, being thus unalterably at Variance with the <HI>dramatic
Form,</HI> the <HI>one</HI> or the <HI>other</HI> mu&s;t be
<HI>de&s;troyed</HI> ere <HI>Proba|bility</HI> and <HI>Pathos</HI> can
ari&s;e.</P>
<P>One Method of a Reform may be effected, by de&s;troying the
<HI>Recitative,</HI> or perpetual <HI>mu&s;ical</HI> Accompanyment: And in this
Ca&s;e, the Interlocutory Part would &s;ink into the common Form of
<HI>Tragedy.</HI> A <HI>mu&s;ical Choir,</HI> di&s;tinct from the Per&s;ons of
the Drama, might &s;till be introduced <PB N="233" REF="240">
<HI>occa&s;ionally,</HI> with much Propriety and Effect<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay, <HI>occa&s;ionally:</HI> For the <HI>continuing</HI>
Choir of the old <HI>Greek</HI> Tra|gedy would be a Circum&s;tance as far out
of Nature, as the Recitative it|&s;elf. Be&s;ides, the perpetual and continuing
Choir would rob modern Tragedy of half her Powers and Graces: A &s;trict Unity
of Place and Time, as we have &s;een, are its nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect. vi. Art. 22.</BIBL></NOTE> But with
Re&s;pect to what is of far greater Importance, I mean the <HI>Action,</HI> its
Effects upon the whole were <HI>bad.</HI> 'Tis true, that even here, it had the
natural Effect of producing <HI>Unity:</HI> But while it &s;ecured the
<HI>Unity</HI> of the <HI>Action,</HI> it gene|rally de&s;troyed its
<HI>Force.</HI> For there are few great, di&s;tre&s;sful, or terrible Actions,
which do not require &s;ome <HI>Variety</HI> of <HI>Place,</HI> in Order to
unfold them in all their mo&s;t pathetic Situations and &s;triking A&s;pects:
Many of the&s;e, therefore, mu&s;t be lo&s;t to the Poet and his Audience, and
a feeble and meagre Fable mu&s;t generally ari&s;e from that &s;trict Unity of
Place which the continuing Choir produced. Hence we often find the Greek
Tragedians reduced to the Nece&s;&s;ity of conveying by Narration many
affecting Incidents, which would have formed capital Scenes, could they have
been introduced con&s;i&s;tently with the Unity of Place. Were it nece&s;&s;ary
to inlarge on this Subject, which is not incurious, it might be proved by an
Induction of particulars, that there is not a great and affecting Tragic Action
in the whole Compa&s;s of Antiquity, but what is mi&s;erably cramped and maimed
by this Con&s;traint; <HI>That</HI> of the <HI>Oedipus Tyrannus</HI> only
excepted, which indeed &s;eems nearly, if not ab&s;olutely perfect, in all the
Parts of its Con&s;truction.</NOTE>. Above all, the Occo&s;ions mu&s;t have a
&s;trong Reference to the mo&s;t pathetic Situations of the tragic action: The
<HI>Choir</HI> mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch Characters, as may with
<HI>Probability</HI> appear in the mu&s;ical Department: The Ode mu&s;t be
written in the Style of Pa&s;&s;ion; not with the Parade of unaffecting
Imagery, or tedious Allegory; which, in&s;tead of rowzing an Audience, would
lull them to Repo&s;e: The Mu&s;ic and Performance mu&s;t be of a
corre&s;pondent Nature. In pointing out this Reform of the mu&s;ical Drama, the
Writer may &s;eem to &s;eparate the two Si&s;ter <PB N="232" REF="241">

<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="234" REF="243"> Arts,
in&s;tead of uniting them: But in Reality, he only propo&s;es their Separation
in one Circum&s;tance, as the nece&s;&s;ary means of compleating their Union in
another.</P>
<P>But le&s;t this &s;hould &s;eem to confine the mu&s;ical Art to an
Alliance with the mere <HI>Ode</HI> or <HI>Hymn</HI> only, and to bani&s;h it
entirely from the Repre&s;entation of <HI>Actions</HI>; let us now proceed to
another and more perfect Kind of Re|form, in which many of the
<HI>Subjects</HI> of the <HI>Opera</HI> and <HI>Oratorio</HI> may be exhibited
in <HI>full Union</HI> with the <HI>Powers of Mu&s;ic,</HI> joined with
<HI>Probability</HI> and <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>We have &s;een above, that from an Union of the <HI>Ode</HI> and
<HI>Epic,</HI> a fir&s;t rude Outline of Tragedy naturally aro&s;e, compounded
of <HI>mu&s;ical Narration</HI> and <HI>choral Song</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect. vi. Art. 19.</BIBL></NOTE>. Here then let
us fix, for the proper Form of the mu&s;ical Exhi|bition of great, terrible, or
pathetic Actions. This Union forms what may properly be &s;tyled the
<HI>Narrative</HI> or <HI>Epic Ode.</HI> It aro&s;e from Nature, at a Period
when the Actions repre&s;ented were of the <HI>&s;imple&s;t</HI> Kind<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. This Simpli|city of Action is
&s;till nece&s;&s;ary to be pre&s;erved, for the Perfection of this Species;
becau&s;e a complicated Action would inevitably produce long and unanimated
Narra|tions, would unnerve the mu&s;ical Recitation, and de&s;troy the very
Genius of the Poem. Suppo&s;ing, then, the Action to be &s;imple and
impa&s;&s;ioned; the <HI>Poem,</HI> the <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> and
<HI>Performance,</HI> if well conducted, will be at|tended with &s;uch a Degree
of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Probability,</HI> as will give the Alliance of
Poetry and Mu&s;ic their highe&s;t Power and Pathos. The intermixed Narrations
mu&s;t be &s;hort and animated: The Songs and Choirs various and 
<PB N="235" REF="244"> expre&s;&s;ive; and being frequently interrupted by the
brief Recitals, may by the&s;e Means be in&s;pirited far beyond the &s;imple
and continued Ode, which from its unbroken Length often degenerates into
Languor. By this Union, all the &s;triking Parts of the Action may be brought
forth to View, while every thing that is cold, improbable, and unaffecting, may
be veiled in Darkne&s;s.&mdash;The <HI>Recitative,</HI> or mu&s;ical
Accompanyment in the <HI>narrative</HI> Parts, will <HI>here</HI> lo&s;e a
great Part of that Improbability which incumbers it in the <HI>dramatic</HI>
Repre&s;entation: For <HI>here,</HI> the <HI>Reciter</HI> is a profe&s;&s;ed
Mu&s;ician, who&s;e Province lies in the Enthu|&s;ia&s;m of Song; and the
<HI>Narrations</HI> being <HI>&s;hort</HI> and <HI>animated,</HI> beyond what
is po&s;&s;ible in the continued U&s;e of <HI>Dialogue,</HI> they approach
nearer to the Genius of the <HI>Ode,</HI> and there|fore may without
Improbability or Impropriety receive a mu&s;ical Accompanyment which approaches
nearer to a full and direct Song.&mdash;And la&s;tly, the <HI>Songs</HI> and
<HI>Choirs</HI> are in their Performance &s;o far from being unnatural, that
they are no more than a powerful Tran&s;cript from Nature, impelling tho&s;e
who hear the Recital of the Action, and are in&s;tructed in the Laws of Melody,
to join in every repre&s;ented Scene of Joy, Triumph, Terror, Exultation,
Devotion, or Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Of this <HI>narrative or Epic Ode,</HI> we have two fine Exam|ples
in our Language, written by POPE and DRYDEN. In Force of Pa&s;&s;ion, and
Variety of corre&s;pondent Ver&s;i|fication<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">We have
&s;hewn above, that the Return of the <HI>&s;ame Mea&s;ure</HI> in the
<HI>Strophe, Anti&s;trophe,</HI> and <HI>Epode,</HI> of the ancient <HI>Greek
Ode,</HI> was the natural Con&s;equence of its Union with the <HI>Dance.</HI>
But this Union being irre|coverably lo&s;t, the unvaried Mea&s;ure of the Ode
becomes at be&s;t an un|meaning Thing; and is indeed an ab&s;urd one, as it
deprives the Poet of that Variety of Mea&s;ure, which often gives a great
Energy to the Com|po&s;ition, by the incidental and &s;udden Intervention of an
<HI>abrupt</HI> or <HI>lengthened</HI> Ver&s;ification. The two Odes here
mentioned, contain a Variety of fine Examples in this Kind of Beauty.</NOTE>,
they are admirable. The Songs and Choirs <PB N="236" REF="245"> are by Turns
tender, joyous, and maje&s;tic, and are often calculated for the noble&s;t and
mo&s;t powerful Union of Poetry and Mu&s;ic. On the other Hand, while their
un|rivalled Excellence is admitted, critical Ju&s;tice demands, that we point
out &s;ome Blemi&s;hes in the&s;e two immortal Odes, le&s;t an
undi&s;tingui&s;hing Principle of Imitation &s;hould lead to an Adoption of
their Faults along with their Beau|ties.&mdash;With Re&s;pect to Mr. POPE's Ode
on St. CECILIA's Day, the <HI>Subject</HI> &s;eems to want <HI>Unity:</HI> It
is not a Recital of <HI>one</HI> great Action, but rather a poetic
De&s;cription of the <HI>Adventures</HI> of ORPHEUS.&mdash;Mr. DRYDEN's Ode is
perfect in the Unity of the Action; but <HI>imperfect</HI> in the <HI>moral
End:</HI> For it is a Repre&s;entation of the abu&s;ed Power of Mu&s;ic, in
firing a young Prince to an Act of Revenge and Cruelty. In the Execution, there
is but one Er|ror of Con&s;equence; which &s;eems to run through both the&s;e
Odes, &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated: The <HI>Narrative</HI> Part is not always
&s;ufficiently <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hed</HI> from the <HI>Song.</HI> They run into
each other in &s;uch a Manner, that the mu&s;ical Compo&s;er mu&s;t often find
him&s;elf embara&s;&s;ed, whether to accompany with Recitative, or a more
compleat Melody. Indeed, it is manife&s;t, that the&s;e illu&s;trious Poets
were not aware of this Di&s;tinction: And hence it came to pa&s;s, that many
Pa&s;&s;ages which they evidently meant for <HI>Song,</HI> are in the Form of
<HI>Narration.</HI> But let this be added, as a Ju&s;tice due to the&s;e
celebrated Names, that the Nar|rations <PB N="237" REF="246"> are in &s;ome
Parts &s;o highly animated, that without any &s;triking Impropriety they admit
the Accompanyment either of the Song or Choir. 'Tis obvious to remark, that
HANDEL was &s;ometimes perplexed by this Irregularity of the poetic
Compo&s;ition, when he &s;et DRYDEN's Ode to Mu&s;ic: For &s;ome Parts are
thrown into Recitative which might &s;eem rather to demand the Song; and others
are thrown into Song, which, in their pre&s;ent Narrative Form, &s;eem rather
to demand the Recitative.&mdash;A Poet of inferior Rank<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mr. HUGHES.</BIBL></NOTE> hath attempted to rectify this
Di&s;order in DRYDEN's <HI>Ode.</HI> But he had not &s;ufficiently e&s;timated
his own Strength, when he adventured to tamper with the Bow of ULYSSES.
Whenever he hath attempted a <HI>Change,</HI> he hath quenched the poetic
Fire.</P>
<P>The Subjects of the narrative or <HI>Epic Ode</HI> may be drawn with
Propriety either from <HI>ethnical</HI> or <HI>&s;acred Story.</HI> The
<HI>ethnical</HI> will furni&s;h tho&s;e which are <HI>moral</HI> or
<HI>political</HI>; the <HI>&s;acred</HI> is a rich Field of Subjects
<HI>moral</HI> and <HI>religious.</HI> There is a peculiar Propriety in
exhibiting the &s;acred Story in this Manner of the <HI>Epic Ode</HI>;
becau&s;e in the dramatic Repre&s;entation of antique Subjects, through the
great Di&s;&s;imilarity of ancient Manners to our own, 'tis difficult to avoid
the Introduction of Circum&s;tances which will not be either manife&s;tly
<HI>incongruous,</HI> or <HI>contemptible</HI> to an <HI>Eye</HI> merely
<HI>modern</HI>; two Appearances, which are carefully to be avoided in the
Repre&s;entation of &s;acred Story. The Way of <HI>Narration,</HI> therefore,
is highly preferable; be|cau&s;e in this, the Poet can produce the greate&s;t
and mo&s;t &s;triking Situations, and at the &s;ame Time pre&s;erve both
<HI>Probability</HI> and <HI>Re&s;pect,</HI> by throwing the re&s;t into
Shades.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="247">That this Repre&s;entation of &s;acred
Subjects is the highe&s;t and mo&s;t intere&s;ting Union of Poetry and Mu&s;ic,
needs no elaborate Proof: It &s;tands intimately connected with all the
&s;ublime Truths, the great and affecting Events of our Religion, which, when
thus exhibited by the united Powers of <HI>Poem</HI> and <HI>Song,</HI> call
forth all the noble&s;t Emotions of the human Soul; and exalt it to the
highe&s;t Pitch of Elevation that our mortal Condition will admit.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIV. CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THUS far then, at lea&s;t, the poetic and mu&s;ical Arts may admit
an effectual Re-union, &s;o as to produce their noble&s;t Ends. As to any
farther Con&s;equences, they mu&s;t be the Effect of this fir&s;t Reform: And
therefore, till &s;omething be done here, it can be of no Importance to point
out higher Improvements, which in the pre&s;ent State of Things would certainly
be e&s;teemed chimerical.</P>
<P>Let us then, for the pre&s;ent, conclude with offering a Que&s;tion,

<Q REND="inline">"Whether our Age and Nation might not &s;till
farther di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf in its Regard for the nobler Arts, by the
In&s;titution of <HI>A Poetic and Mu&s;ical Academy,</HI> for the more
effectual <HI>Re-union</HI> of the&s;e two Arts, and their better
<HI>Direction</HI> to their <HI>highe&s;t Ends?</HI>"</Q>&mdash;The Judgment of
an able and di&s;intere&s;ted Society, e&s;tabli&s;hed for this Purpo&s;e,
might perhaps effect every Reform here propo&s;ed in the four di&s;tinct
Species in which the two Arts are &s;till imperfectly and improperly united.
The Prize mu&s;t be Honour only; le&s;t mercenary Spirits <PB N="239" REF="248"> &s;hould intrude upon the Walk of Genius. It may be &s;up|po&s;ed,
that the be&s;t Poets, of the ri&s;ing Age at lea&s;t, would court the
Approbation of &s;uch an Academy: And from this In&s;titution, as from a
Nur&s;ery of the&s;e Si&s;ter-Arts, a Succe&s;&s;ion of approved Poems would
naturally ari&s;e, in every Form that could properly receive the Colourings and
Embelli&s;hments of Mu&s;ic.&mdash;The familiar <HI>Song,</HI> com|po&s;ed for
dome&s;tic and &s;ocial Entertainment, when thus cha&s;ti&s;ed by the moral
Decrees of the Academy, would gradually ri&s;e into its ancient Dignity and
U&s;e.&mdash;The Selection of the <HI>Anthem</HI> from the &s;acred Scriptures
might receive the public Approbation of the Society: And the <HI>Hymn,</HI>
controuled by the &s;ame &s;ober Judgments, would a&s;|&s;ume that pathetic
Sublimity and Simplicity of Style, which tends to elevate the Soul to the
Contemplation and Love of divine Things.&mdash;The <HI>tragic Choir,</HI>
properly re&s;trained and limited by &s;uch an Authority, might
<HI>oc|ca&s;ionally</HI> be introduced and applied to the Increa&s;e of Pity
and Terror, and to all the moral Ends of the dramatic Species. The <HI>Epic
Ode,</HI> directed by the Ta&s;te and Wi&s;|dom of this Academy, would obtain
its Completion. The greate&s;t and mo&s;t affecting Subjects, drawn from the
Hi&s;tory of our own or other Countries, would ri&s;e before us; while the
&s;ublime&s;t and mo&s;t intere&s;ting Events re|corded in the &s;acred
Scriptures, thus recommended and adorned, would make their Way through the
nobler Pa&s;|&s;ions to the Heart.</P>
<P>The State and Character of our <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> would be no le&s;s
influenced by the Authority of &s;uch an In&s;titution. The Poems which
&s;hould receive its unbia&s;&s;ed Approbation, would naturally become Objects
of the Ambition of our <PB N="240" REF="249" MS="y"> be&s;t
<HI>Compo&s;ers:</HI> Who&s;e Genius, thus cha&s;ti&s;ed and di|rected to its
proper Ends, would no longer wander into the illegitimate Fanta&s;ies of Song;
but in ju&s;t Subor|dination to the poetic Expre&s;&s;ions, would only be
am|bitious of joining its Powers, for the Production of a true
<HI>Pathos.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Performance</HI> of the&s;e approved <HI>Poems</HI> thus
heighten|ed by approved <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> would naturally corre&s;pond with the
Genius of Both, if under the Controul of the &s;ame wi&s;e Judgments. The
<HI>Singers</HI> would no longer think them&s;elves at Liberty to de&s;ert
their Subject for the Pride of Execution: But, under the In&s;pection of a
&s;uperior Ta&s;te and Authority, would be led to adopt a true Sim|plicity of
Manner; and, like the ju&s;t <HI>Actor,</HI> would be only ambitious of
a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Poet and Mu&s;ician, in adorn|ing and compleating the
intended Repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Importance</HI> of &s;uch an In&s;titution may de&s;erve our
mo&s;t &s;erious thoughts. We have &s;een above, how con|genial the
<HI>poetic</HI> and <HI>mu&s;ical</HI> Arts are with the Frame and Faculties of
Man: That in every Period of Manners, whether &s;avage, barbarous, civilized,
refined, or cor|rupted, their Influence hath been felt in every Nation of the
Earth. So univer&s;al and powerful are their Effects on the Pa&s;&s;ions of the
Soul, that perhaps no Period of human Nature can be a&s;&s;igned (at lea&s;t,
the Writer knows of none) in which they have not been either
<HI>&s;alu|tary</HI> or <HI>pernicious:</HI> In which they have not either
tended to promote and confirm Religion, Virtue, and public Hap|pine&s;s; or
been the In&s;truments of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and public Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="250" MS="y">Add to this, that whoever will look
back into the pre|ceding Pages, will find that in all <HI>poli&s;hed
States</HI> the&s;e Arts have a natural Tendency towards Corruption, unle&s;s
checked and cha&s;ti&s;ed by whole&s;ome In&s;titutions. This Tendency
ari&s;eth not from the Nature of the Arts them|&s;elves; but from that
<HI>Period of Manners,</HI> which tends to pervert them from their <HI>proper
Ends.</HI>&mdash;Would you quench this natural Flame implanted in the human
Brea&s;t? The Attempt were Folly. You mu&s;t de&s;troy our <HI>Eyes</HI> and
<HI>Ears,</HI> tho&s;e Inlets to the Powers of <HI>Poetry</HI> and
<HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> before you can accompli&s;h &s;uch a Purpo&s;e. What then is
to be done, but to regulate this mighty Stream, which will inevitably run
either in the Channel of <HI>Vice</HI> or <HI>Virtue?</HI></P>
<P>More particularly, in a great and powerful Kingdom, where additional
Degrees of Wealth &s;hould flow in with every Tide; the&s;e, e&s;pecially in a
Time of Peace, mu&s;t in|evitably be followed by new Degrees of inventive
Luxury, and an unwearied Pa&s;&s;ion for Di&s;&s;ipation and Amu&s;ement. Hence
the peculiar Danger would ari&s;e, even where no ill Intentions &s;hould dwell,
of a Perver&s;ion of the <HI>mimetic,</HI> and e&s;pecially, of the
<HI>poetic</HI> and <HI>mu&s;ical Arts,</HI> from their proper and exalted, to
their improper and ignoble Ends.&mdash;If in &s;uch a Kingdom, their lowe&s;t
Forms &s;hould be &s;ought for, while their higher were neglected; if Tragedy
&s;hould give Way to Comedy, and Comedy to Farce, and Farce to Pantomime; if
Privileges &s;hould be denied to the <HI>Labours</HI> of <HI>Genius,</HI> which
were indulged to the Tricks of <HI>Harlequin</HI> and
<HI>Pierot</HI>;&mdash;what could be more ju&s;tly feared, than a general
Decline of Ta&s;te, which by &s;ilent and un|perceived Degrees might
in&s;en&s;ibly &s;lide into the &s;ame <PB N="242" REF="251" MS="y"> fatal
Effects, which marked the later Periods of the <HI>Greek</HI> Republics, and
the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire?</P>
<P>On the contrary; an effectual Union of the&s;e two power|ful Arts,
directed to their proper Ends, would be pro|ductive of the noble&s;t
Con&s;equences: It would renew and augment the Dignity of every elegant
Accompli&s;hment; would refine the Ta&s;te, inforce the Religion, purify the
Morals, &s;trengthen the Policy, of the mo&s;t pro&s;perous Kingdom; in a Word,
would give a proper and &s;alutary Direction to that Overflow of Wealth, which
mu&s;t either <HI>adorn</HI> or <HI>overwhelm</HI> it.</P>
<P>An <HI>In&s;titution,</HI> therefore, which may promote &s;uch
<HI>im|portant Ends,</HI> may &s;eem not only to claim the Atten|tion of the
<HI>Wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> in every private Station; but might perhaps
be regarded as not unworthy the <HI>Protection</HI> of the <HI>be&s;t</HI> and
<HI>greate&s;t</HI> KING.</P>

<P> Whereas it is come to the Knowledg of the Lord
Pre&s;ident, and other our Council in our Marche&s;&s;e of Wales, that vagrant
and idle Per&s;ons naming them&s;elves <HI>Min&s;trels, Rythmers,</HI> and
<HI>Bards,</HI> are lately grown into &s;uch <HI>intolerable Multitude</HI>
within the Principality of North Wales, that not only Gentlemen and others by 
<PB N="244" REF="253"> their <HI>&s;hamele&s;s Di&s;orders</HI> are oftentimes
di&s;quieted in their Habitations, but al&s;o the <HI>expert Min&s;trels</HI>
and <HI>Mu&s;i|cians</HI> in <HI>Tonge</HI> and <HI>Cunynge</HI> thereby much
di&s;couraged to travaile in the Exerci&s;e and Practi&s;e of their Knowledg,
and al&s;o not a little hindred <HI>(of)</HI> Livings and Prefer|ment; The
Reformation whereof, and the putting the&s;e People in Order, the &s;aid Lord
Pre&s;ident and Council have thought very nece&s;&s;ary: And knowing you to be
Men of both Wi&s;dom and upright Dealing, and al&s;o of Experience and good
Knowledge in the Scyence, have appointed and authorized You to be
Commi&s;&s;ioners for that Purpo&s;e: And fora&s;much as our &s;aid Council, of
late travailing in &s;ome Part of the &s;aid Principality, had perfect
Under&s;tanding by credible Report, that the ac|cu&s;tomed Place for the
Execution of the like Com|mi&s;&s;ion hath been heretofore at Cayroes in our
County of Flynt, and that William Mo&s;tyn E&s;q. and his Ance&s;tors have had
the Gift and be&s;towing of the <HI>Sylver Harp</HI> appertaining to the
<HI>Chief</HI> of <HI>that Faculty,</HI> and that a <HI>Year's Warning</HI> (at
lea&s;t) hath been accu&s;tomed to be given of the <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> and
Execution of the like Com|mi&s;&s;ion; Our &s;aid Council have therefore
appointed the Execution of this Commi&s;&s;ion to be at the &s;aid Town of
Cayroes, the Monday next after the Fea&s;t of the Ble&s;&s;ed Trinity which
&s;hall be in the Year of our Lord 1568. And therefore we require and command
You by the Authority of the&s;e Pre&s;ents, not only to cau&s;e <HI>open
Pro|clamation</HI> to be made in all <HI>Fairs, Market-Towns,</HI> and other
<HI>Places of A&s;&s;embly</HI> within our Counties of Aglere, Carnarvon,
Meryonydd, Denbigh and Mynt, that all and every Per&s;on and Per&s;ons that
intend to <HI>maintain</HI> their <PB N="245" REF="254"> <HI>Living</HI> by
name or Colour of <HI>Min&s;trels, Rythmers,</HI> or <HI>Bards,</HI> within the
Talaith of Aberffraw, comprehending the &s;aid five Shires, &s;hall be and
appear before You the &s;aid Day and Place to <HI>&s;hew</HI> their
<HI>Learnings</HI> accordingly: But al&s;o, that You, twenty, nineteen,
eighteen, &s;eventeen, &s;ixteen, fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven,
ten, nine, eight, &s;even, or &s;ix of you, whereof You the &s;aid Sir Richard
Bulkely, Sir Rees Griffith, Ellis Price, and William Mo&s;tyn E&s;qs. or three
or two of you, to be of the Number; to repair to the &s;aid Place the Days
afore|&s;aid, and calling to you &s;uch <HI>expert Men</HI> in the &s;aid
<HI>Faculty</HI> of the <HI>Wel&s;h Mu&s;ick</HI> as to You &s;hall be thought
con|venient, to proceed to the Execution of the Premi&s;es, and to admit &s;uch
and &s;o many, as by your Wi&s;doms and Knowledges you &s;hall find
<HI>worthy,</HI> into and under the <HI>Degrees</HI> heretofore <HI>(in

<HI>follow</HI> the <HI>Sciences</HI> and <HI>Faculties</HI> of their

of their Degrees, and as your Di&s;cretions and Wi&s;doms &s;hall pre&s;cribe
unto them: Giving &s;treight Monition and Commandment in our Name and on our
Behalf to the re&s;t not worthy, that they return to &s;ome hone&s;t Labour,

<P>From this Commi&s;&s;ion it appears, 1^&s;^t, That although many
of the <HI>Bards</HI> were ma&s;&s;acred by EDWARD the Fir&s;t, yet the whole
<HI>Order</HI> was by no means exterminated. 2^d^l^y, That in the Reign of
ELIZABETH, Abu&s;es had crept on among the <HI>Wel&s;h Bards,</HI> &s;imilar to
tho&s;e which are re|corded of the <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI> 3^d^l^y, That public
<HI>Conte&s;ts</HI> for <HI>poetic</HI> and <HI>mu&s;ical Fame</HI> had been
e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Wales</HI> from an|cient Times. 4^t^h^l^y, That the&s;e
Conte&s;ts are now cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>In Wotton's "Leges Wallicae," (Append, p. 547, 548.) there are two
Laws of Henry the Fourth recorded, which relate to the Prevention of the
Abu&s;es of the Bard's Pro|fe&s;&s;ion; but in &s;uch general Terms, that
nothing relative to the particular State of their Mu&s;ic and Poetry can be
collected from them.</P>
<P>The Author will e&s;teem it a &s;ingular Favour, if any Gentleman
can tran&s;mit to him an authentic Account of the final Decline of the Bard's
Profe&s;&s;ion in Wales.</P>
