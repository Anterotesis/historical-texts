<P>THE variety of Adverti&s;ements by &s;everal Ma&s;ter Taylors in London, who have candour and hone&s;ty enough to adhere &s;trictly to the terms of their propo&s;als, induces him to offer his mo&s;t humble addre&s;s to the Publick, in hopes of &s;uch encouragement as his ability and integrity &s;hall claim.&mdash;Gentlemen who are plea&s;ed to favour him with their commi&s;&s;ions may rely upon their being executed according to the following rates:</P>

<P>In ca&s;es of emergency a Suit made for a gentleman on one day's notice.&mdash;Whole Sets of Liveries executed in two days after receiving the order.</P>
<P>Although the above Prices are much inferior to Taylors Bills in general, he undertakes to fur|ni&s;h every article of the be&s;t quality.</P>
<P>Gentlemen finding their own Cloth, or &s;ervants liveries, will be equally acceptable; and when fini&s;hed, (upon calculation), will be found not to exceed the above e&s;timation.</P>
<P>No &s;cruple as to &s;izes, like &s;ome of his adverti&s;ing Brethren, admitting of all that comprehend common &s;izes.&mdash;Silk Garters to Breeches under&s;tood.&mdash;Ladies Riding Habits and Childrens Clothes made with ta&s;te, and to fit to a Nicety, which is what few Taylors attempt, and fewer perform to &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>A little con&s;ideration mu&s;t be productive of the po&s;&s;ibility of the above Plan's being executed with honour and ju&s;tice, e&s;pecially as every article is purcha&s;ed with ready money; the underta|ker's ambition extending no further than doing ju&s;tice to his cu&s;tomers, and procuring a genteel livelihood for his family, in preference to riches.</P>
