<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Don't que&s;tion but that a Trea|ti&s;e of this Nature will be e|&s;teemed by a great many at this Time (when we &s;ee &s;uch Numbers crowding into the Pulpit) to be ei|ther a &s;ini&s;ter or vain Attempt, and already confuted by Experience. For were the Difficulties and Di&s;|couragements real, they may ima|gine that the Effect of them would be quickly &s;een in the Paucity of Candidates for Holy Orders. The
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
Calamities (they may plead) of tho&s;e already in the Profe&s;&s;ion would give Warning to others.</P>
<P>This Ob&s;ervation tho' it be allow|ed to hold good in Re&s;pect of many &s;ecular Employments and Occupa|tions; in&s;omuch that (when the Num|ber of Hands exceed the Demands; or any Failure abridge the Gains, and make it impo&s;&s;ible for a great many of tho&s;e, who are concerned in any particular Craft to get a comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tence by it) gene|ral Clamours are pre&s;ently heard, and as if even &s;ome Contagion had in|fected it; none are willing to engage them&s;elves, or any of their Family in it. Yet mu&s;t it be confe&s;&s;ed, that hitherto its Influence has not affect|ed the Mini&s;try; neither has the Church been deprived of one Pro|fe&s;&s;or,
<PB N="v" REF="4">
notwith&s;tanding that they have had as rea&s;onable Grounds for Com|plaints, as any Body of Men what|&s;oever.</P>
<P>What this is to be imputed to, is not &s;o ea&s;y to determine. I &s;hall &s;eek out no other Solution of this Matter, but what a very learned Man has given us,</P>
<P><Q>While, &s;ays he, I re&s;ided at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and &s;aw &s;uch a Conflux of Youth to their annual Admi&s;&s;ions; I have often &s;tudied and admired, why their Parents would under &s;uch mean Encouragements de&s;ign their Sons for the Church; and tho&s;e the mo&s;t towardly and capa|ble and &s;elect Genius's among their Children, who mu&s;t needs have emerg'd in a &s;ecular Life. I con|gratulated indeed the Felicity of
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
your E&s;tabli&s;hment, which attrac|ted the choice Youth of your Na|tion for &s;uch very low Pay: but my Wonder was at the Parents, who generally have Intere&s;t, Main|tenance, and Wealth, the fir&s;t Thing in their View: Till at la&s;t one of your State Lotteries ceas'd my A&s;toni&s;hment. For as in that a few glittering Prizes, <HI>1.000, 5.000, 10.000</HI> Pounds among an Infinity of Blanks, drew Troops of Adventurers; who if the whole Fund had been equally ticketed out, would never have come in: So a few Dignities in your Church, Prebends, Deaneries, Bi&s;hopricks, are the pious Fraud that induces and decoys the Parents to ri&s;k their Child's Fortune in it. Every one hopes his own will get &s;ome
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
great Prize in the Church, and never reflects on the Thou&s;ands of Blanks in poor Country Livings.</Q></P>
<P>This lets us into the My&s;tery, and at once di&s;covers the Rea&s;on why the Church is &s;o fully &s;tock'd with Di|vines. The Parents hope and ex|pect in a little Time to &s;ee their Chil|dren dignified: but when (upon Try|al) they have found their Hopes to have been fallacious, it is then that the Difficulties and Di&s;couragements appear in their true Light; and what &s;hould have been fore&s;een, is by &s;ad Experience felt.</P>
<P>To prevent the unwary from be|ing &s;urprized, and the Church from being burdened with tho&s;e, who have no other Views, but of being &s;up|ported by it, is the De&s;ign of the en|&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="7">It is very far from my Thoughts or Purpo&s;e to degrade the Office (for which I have the greate&s;t Reverence and E&s;teem) neither would I for the whole World contribute (was I able) to the detaining &s;ufficient Num|bers from the Service of God, and by that Means make the Church de&s;ti|tute: Of which at pre&s;ent there &s;eems to be no Danger. The Danger is ra|ther from the rever&s;e: For Supernu|meraries there are at pre&s;ent, who might very well be &s;pared: For whom &s;ince there is no Provi&s;ion, there is therefore no Occa&s;ion for them. But now it is too late to remedy an Incon|venience &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt by many.</P>
<P>If I could therefore be at all in|&s;trumental in diverting for the Time to come (by laying the Difficulties and Di&s;couragements before them)
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
any from entering into this Sacred Office, who upon &s;erious Reflection &s;hould be thought unable to encoun|ter with them; If I could per&s;wade tho&s;e to &s;eclude them&s;elves, or ra|ther their Friends to find out &s;ome properer Employment for them; from whom there can be little Hope or Probability of their ever being very &s;erviceable to the Church; and if they alone would offer them&s;elves for Admi&s;&s;ion, who&s;e Abilities ena|ble them to do Service, and their pious Re&s;olutions prompt them to un|dertake it in Spite of all the Hard|&s;hips they are like to meet with; If my Endeavours to effect this have but the lea&s;t Succe&s;s, my Intention is an|&s;wered; and even if they have not, I have &s;till the private Satisfaction of Meaning well.</P>

<HEAD>A SHORT VIEW OF THE DIFFICULTIES <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT will be allowed, I believe, that a more than ordinary Influence of di|vine Grace is not expected or requi|&s;ite as a Qualification for the being ad|mitted into holy Orders. When any offer them&s;elves for the&s;e, they can't with any Truth affirm, that they are moved by a|ny &s;tronger or more &s;en&s;ible Impul&s;e of the Holy Spirit than is common to them|&s;elves or to any other good Men in the
<PB N="12" REF="11">
Exerci&s;e of chri&s;tian Duties; nor, if they had a Mind to deceive others with it, could they gain their Belief.</P>
<P>The Inducement which they have (al|lowing for the inward and ordinary Mo|tion of the Holy Gho&s;t which they tru&s;t that they have, and for &s;ome pious Re&s;o|lutions) is the Con&s;equence of their Edu|cation, and their being brought up and de|&s;igned for this Office, even before they them&s;elves knew what it was.</P>
<P>Our Church is neither &s;tock'd with mi|raculous Gifts nor pretends to any. It &s;uf|fices without them, if tho&s;e that de&s;ire to &s;erve at her Altars, come recommended for Regularity of Life, and bring along with them a requi&s;ite Portion of Learning: Which latter, &s;mall as it is, however quali|fies according to Canon; and is generally accepted of by the Governours of our Church: Tho' they have it in their Power, if they think proper, to refu&s;e Orders with|out giving any Rea&s;on for it. But &s;uch is the unhappy State of tho&s;e, who have been all along educated for this Purpo&s;e, (and this is all too many have to plead,) that &s;hould they be rejected, it would be
<PB N="13" REF="12">
too late to turn their Hands to any thing el&s;e; their Fortune which might have ena|bled them to have done it, being already &s;pent; and their Parents, Relations, and Friends being &s;o much concerned in it, and their Hearts &s;o much &s;et upon it, that our Right Reverend Bi&s;hops very &s;eldom make U&s;e of their Authority without &s;ome legal Impediment.</P>
<P>Granting then that Orders may be &s;ome|times had on pretty ea&s;y Terms, in Regard to the Article of Learning; and that there|fore a Deacon is at length &s;prung up in the Family: Yet what mighty Pro&s;pect is there for the Youth thus barely furni&s;hed? If his Fortune is now to make, and his Title is his all, which is commonly the Ca&s;e; that for the mo&s;t part leads him into the Country, to &s;ome &s;canty ob&s;cure Curacy, ju&s;t e|nough to keep him alive; and happy is it for him that he is thrown into &s;ome &s;olita|ry barbarous Place, where his Audience is &s;o well adapted to his Abilities. For here he may by weekly Labour, by plodding, and torturing and racking his Brains, &s;queeze out &s;omething, (whether coherent or in|coherent, it is no Matter) which with
<PB N="14" REF="13">
much adoe (by changing and exchanging, and the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary tho' ve|ry indifferent Helps) may be lick'd into the Model of a Thing commonly called a Ser|mon. From hence the Congregation is to learn the Importance of Religion; and of|tentimes becau&s;e they know no better, are plea&s;ed with and applaud their Preacher; e&s;pecially when Nature, which has been &s;paring of Brains, has made Amends for that Defect in Lungs.</P>
<P>This, you will &s;ay, is a &s;ingular Felicity, and very lucky for him. But if the young Theologue &s;hould not be &s;atisfied with this; but, fired with the Prai&s;es of his Congrega|tion, &s;hould imagine that they are not much mi&s;taken in him? and &s;hould there|fore a&s;pire a little higher, how can we conceive which Way his Ends are to be brought to pa&s;s? How can we trace him out any further? Tho&s;e who have any Prefer|ments in their Gifts (of any con&s;iderable Va|lue) are very often judicious and di&s;cerning; and if they have no Relation, or particular Friend, or Dependant to oblige, they are then willing to oblige them&s;elves; and to &s;hew their Knowledge of Men, are gene|rally
<PB N="15" REF="14">
inclined to prefer one of Learning and good Accompli&s;hments; that from thence &s;ome of the Credit and Reputa|tion of the Clerk may be reflected on the Patron.</P>
<P>This, one would think &s;hould put a Check upon the a&s;piring Thoughts of my young Divine: Or if notwith&s;tanding he will take his Level; it mu&s;t be at &s;omething which his Betters have refu&s;ed; and which if he gets, it is becau&s;e Nobody el&s;e would ac|cept of it. The Value of which we may ea&s;ily gue&s;s, when even &s;uch Numbers of learned and very worthy Men are &s;o mean|ly provided for.</P>
<P>I &s;hould de&s;cend further, and view him in this his accidental Benefice, and now in his Meridian, &s;ettled in the World, and be|ginning to think that it is not good for Man to be alone: But here I &s;hall leave him; his Condition in this State being much bet|ter already de&s;cribed in a ludicrous Manner than I can do in a &s;erious one.</P>
<P>However, as the Fault is not to be char|ged on the unhappy Sufferer, it being im|po&s;&s;ible for any one to correct natural De|fects; this &s;hould be a Warning to Parents
<PB N="16" REF="15">
not to engage their Children in this Sort of Education, 'till their Abilities have been impartially weighed by them them&s;elves; or which is better without having fir&s;t had the Opinion of tho&s;e, who may be prope|rer Judges of them. This is however lit|tle regarded! For too often the mo&s;t un|promi&s;ing Child of the Family is pitch'd up|on; and he whom the Father thinks to be unfit for any thing el&s;e, is dedicated to the Service of God: By which we may gue&s;s at the Under&s;tanding and Piety of the Fa|ther, and pre&s;age the future Mi&s;ery of the unhappy Son, and be &s;ure to find him, where I before left him. Contemptible Ig|norance and Stupidity as well as barbarous Cruelty to his own Child! What, does it require &s;ome extraordinary Talent to whoop after Bullocks and whi&s;tle after Sheep? a mighty Genius, to weigh a Pound of Figs, or to mea&s;ure a Yard of Tape? whil&s;t any thing will &s;erve for the Altars of God. Pi|ty is it and injurious to Society, that &s;uch &s;ordid Parents &s;hould have the Di&s;po&s;al of and Authority to ruin their own Chil|dren! But I am heartily tir'd with this me|lancholy Scene, tho' it be a true De&s;crip|tion
<PB N="17" REF="16">
of the unhappy Ca&s;e of many, who might perhaps have made very pretty Gra|ziers or notable Handicrafts.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s that I have hitherto been deal|ing in Dreggs, and drawing out the Pro|&s;pect only of Incapables; the Burdens of the Church, and very often it's Reproach and Scandal. The&s;e therefore may be thought Exceptions; and the unlucky Star reigning at their Birth to have been in Fault; but that every thing goes &s;moothly on with tho&s;e, who&s;e natural Capacities are &s;uitable to the Ta&s;k they undertake. I wi&s;h it was &s;o, and that there were no Ruggs in their Way; but &s;ince there are I &s;han't hide them.</P>
<P>To begin with the Studies of tho&s;e who are capable of them, for to be capable is nothing without Application. A Power to move without actually putting him&s;elf into Motion will never bring a Man to his Journey's End. He therefore that de&s;igns to take Holy Orders, and would rightly qualify for them; (&s;o far as to commence a Workman that need not be a&s;hamed) mu&s;t with uncommon Diligence bend his Mind to the Study of the three learned
<PB N="18" REF="17">
Languages, the <HI>Latin, Greek,</HI> and <HI>He|brew;</HI> for the&s;e are the Keys to Know|ledge; and he that thinks to open the Lock without them, will find him&s;elf much mi&s;taken, as he likewi&s;e will, if he does not &s;et about the&s;e betimes. For it has been &s;eldom found, that they who begin to learn a Language at the Meridian or Decline of Life make any great Profi|ciency, or become &s;kilful Profe&s;&s;ors of it. But here I mu&s;t beg not to be mi&s;|under&s;tood; as if I meant that it was expected of a young Student at the Age of three and twenty to be a perfect Ma&s;ter of the&s;e Languages; I only mean that he ought to make what Progre&s;s he can in them (along with his other Studies) before he comes for holy Orders; that hereafter he may go on with the greater Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>And what weari&s;ome Days and watch|ful Nights does this Undertaking require? what deep Meditation and Recollection to trea&s;ure up Words in the Memory, and to &s;tore it with the Knowledge of Things? how often mu&s;t he beat them over, &s;epa|rate, divide, and dige&s;t them, before he will be ready in calling them forth upon
<PB N="19" REF="18">
Occa&s;ion? or be able to expre&s;s him&s;elf, elegantly, clearly, and judiciou&s;ly?</P>
<P>Little enough for this Work is the great|e&s;t Part of his Time! and many Diver&s;ions mu&s;t he maugre, to which Youth are na|turally inclinable; the mo&s;t ingenious as well as others: For the quicker the Ta&s;te, the &s;tronger the Appetite; and the bright|e&s;t Parts are not always the fitte&s;t for Ap|plication.</P>
<P>Be that as it will; Adherence is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary; and they that &s;et light to it, be their natural Talents ever &s;o good, they will never &s;upply the Defects of Idle|ne&s;s, or glo&s;s over their Ignorance: Which if it does not appear in downright Stupi|dity and Dullne&s;s, it will however &s;hew it&s;elf in Pertne&s;s and in palpable Blunders and Mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>Fully for this Rea&s;on mu&s;t the mo&s;t pro|mi&s;ing Youth re&s;olve, either to be con|tent not to &s;hine in the Church, or to be indu&s;trious.</P>
<P>For &s;o far will he be (without it) from being intitled to any Manner of Applau&s;e and Reputation, that he will only add one more to the Number of Po&s;&s;ibilities.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19">Notwith&s;tanding the Truth of this, as if Idlene&s;s wanted Patronage and Encourage|ment, the learned Languages are com|monly talked of and repre&s;ented as dead Languages; and that by tho&s;e who (for their own Sakes) &s;hould have been &s;ilent, and conceal'd their own Shame; and not have declared their Ignorance of them by this Expre&s;&s;ion, upon which to put the right genuine Interpretation; it is that the Repre&s;enters are dead to the Languages, and to all good Intents and Purpo&s;es in Re&s;pect of their Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>What the learned Languages dead and u&s;ele&s;s to Clergymen, to whom is com|mitted the Cu&s;tody of the Law and the Prophets, the Go&s;pels and Epi&s;tles?</P>
<P>Is there not a peculiar Idiom belonging to all Languages, more particularly to the <HI>Hebrew Tongue;</HI> and are there not &s;ome moral and political Words in the <HI>Greek,</HI> to which none an&s;wer in other Languages and which are hardly to be fully expre&s;s'd in them? Or can the Sen&s;e and Meaning of any Author be &s;o exactly under&s;tood in Tran&s;lation, as in the original Language in which it was wrote?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">If this is manife&s;tly the Ca&s;e in Re&s;|pect of the holy Scriptures; what notable Commentators &s;hould we have without under&s;tanding <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Hebrew?</HI> They would &s;oon verify the Parable; <HI>Can the Blind lead the Blind? &s;hall they not both fall into the Ditch?</HI></P>
<P>To &s;ilence therefore this &s;en&s;ele&s;s Pre|tence; let us for once &s;uppo&s;e, that a ge|neral Infatuation had &s;eiz'd on the mo&s;t learned Part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Clergy; and that they were all fallen from their pre|&s;ent Glory, and the Reputation which they ju&s;tly have all over <HI>Europe</HI> for their Skill in all Parts of Learning; fallen &s;o far, that there was not one of them left, who had any Manner of Knowledge of the <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongues. What a fine Piece of Work would the Freethinkers and Li|bertines of this Age make with the Holy Scriptures, and con&s;equently Religion? who, tho' but Smatterers in Languages, yet when they had only <HI>Ignoramus</HI>'s to deal with, they might interpret as they pleas'd and &s;lip any thing upon the Church. For &s;hould they affirm that &s;uch and &s;uch Pa&s;|&s;ages in the Tran&s;lation of the Holy Scrip|tures
<PB N="22" REF="21">
were &s;purious and fal&s;e and quite contrary to the Original (and what would be more likely than for them to do this) who under &s;uch Circum&s;tances could con|tradict them?</P>
<P>The Church, &s;o ably &s;upported with Learning as it is at pre&s;ent, can &s;carcely prevent the&s;e Mi&s;creants making &s;ome Pro&s;elytes, among&s;t the giddy weak and luxurious; but take away this Support, it mu&s;t of Cour&s;e &s;ink, and a Torrent of all Manner of Errors and Vices would &s;oon break in like a Deluge upon us; and if they could prevail &s;o far; we &s;hould &s;oon have the Doctrines of <HI>Epicurus</HI> e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by Law, and fathered upon the Scriptures.</P>
<P>But the Danger from that Quarter would not be the only one to be feared; for what if the Papi&s;ts &s;hould get the Cu|&s;tody of the Scriptures again? I mean of the original Languages in which they were wrote? might we not in a little Time ex|pect to &s;ee twelve more new lucrative Ar|ticles of Faith tacked to <HI>Pope Pius</HI> his Creed? They might pawm as they would upon us, if they did but pretend that they
<PB N="23" REF="22">
found them in the Original, and clamour loudly again&s;t our Tran&s;lation, as partial and defective; for there would be no o|ther Remedy than recurring to the Origi|nal; but this would not be in the Power of our Clergy to do.</P>
<P>Is it not therefore ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e who wi&s;h Pro&s;perity to our Church and Religion, and de&s;ign to engage them|&s;elves in the Mini&s;try, to prepare them|&s;elves for it by Labour and Study, as much as may be before they enter upon it; and afterwards likewi&s;e to continue the &s;ame? And this I would recommend to the timely Con&s;ideration of both them and their Friends; whether they think they will be able to undertake this and go thro' it; and even to per&s;evere to the End of their Lives, or &s;o long as their Faculties remain entire.</P>
<P>There is Nothing to be done without it; for the greate&s;t Genius cultivated as it ought (thro' the &s;hort Time of Life allot|ted) is not able to reach to, or compre|hend all Parts of Science, or &s;carcely to fini&s;h or clear up one: Which takes away all Pleas for Lazine&s;s, and baffles the Suf|ficiency
<PB N="24" REF="23">
of &s;ome, who perhaps have the lea&s;t Rea&s;on of any to pretend to it. For was there any allowable Excu&s;e to ju&s;tify this in one, the &s;ame would allow it to another, and &s;o at la&s;t to all; which would of Cour&s;e draw after it the Con&s;e|quences I a little before repeated. One Clergyman might plead his Right to La|zine&s;s another his and &s;o all, 'till at Length Religion would be left to &s;hift for it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Which Ob&s;ervation every Clergyman who is a Well-wi&s;her to true Religion ought to apply to him&s;elf, and to con&s;ider (tho' the Church at pre&s;ent may thrive well enough upon the Stock of Learning which the great Men of it to their Ho|nour po&s;&s;e&s;s) that it is but a mean and beg|garly Thing to take Shelter under the Me|rits of Others. For &s;hould no Emula|tors of their great Accompli&s;hments here|after ari&s;e, we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee Religion brought to a very low Ebb: And even whil&s;t the&s;e great Lights remain among&s;t us, what Numbers of Congregations in the mean Sea&s;on (whom their Influence cannot reach) mu&s;t &s;uffer and be in the Dark, unle&s;s their Guides (to who&s;e par|ticular
<PB N="25" REF="24">
Charge they are committed) take Care to enlighten them&s;elves and then their Flock.</P>
<P>When the Care of Souls becomes the Undertaking of any, their Labour and In|du&s;try ought (as far as po&s;&s;ible) in all Re|&s;pects relating to them to be proportiona|ble to the Worth of them. Nor can the Ignorance and Meanne&s;s of tho&s;e with whom they are entru&s;ted ever be a rea&s;o|nable Excu&s;e for their own; becau&s;e they are &s;ent on Purpo&s;e to clear up their Blind|ne&s;s and Errors; and if they don't &s;trive as much as they can to effect this, they do but trifle in their Office, and &s;how them&s;elves unfit for the Ta&s;k they have undertaken.</P>
<P>Every one therefore that is lawfully allowed to be put in Tru&s;t with the Go&s;|pel ought to lay his Hand upon his Heart and &s;eriou&s;ly reflect on the Duty incum|bent on Him; and if it &s;hould happen to be his Lot to attend upon the weak in Under&s;tanding, he &s;hould on that Account be &s;o far from de&s;pi&s;ing them, or from thinking that he has then Freedom to in|dulge, or that any thing tho' ever &s;o
<PB N="26" REF="25">
mean will &s;erve their Turns, that in&s;tead thereof he ought to double his Diligence, and take more than ordinary Pains in &s;hewing them the right Paths in which they ought to walk. This is the Duty of a good Clergyman, and the End of his Office, and every one that is in earne&s;t will think &s;o, and act agreeable thereto.</P>
<P>For whatever &s;ome may think, or even by Experience find, that there is no Ne|ce&s;&s;ity for all this Pains and Trouble, &s;ince there are ea&s;ier and &s;horter Ways (and in &s;ome Re&s;pects more meritorious) of get|ting at what they may &s;et their Heart up|on; yet let me tell them, that many of tho&s;e Ways are di&s;hone&s;t and di&s;honoura|ble; bring Contempt upon their Order; and, whil&s;t true Merit is wanting, make them &s;ecretly de&s;pi&s;ed even by tho&s;e who&s;e De&s;igns they are carrying on. For No|thing is &s;urer, than that a good Stock of Learning, Integrity, and Virtue joined with a prudent Conduct are the only true Re|commendations, and which alone can command Applau&s;e, Re&s;pect, and E&s;teem.</P>
<P>It is by the&s;e that the Affections of the &s;ober and judicious Part of the Laity are

riveted in the Favour and Love of the Clergy and good Opinion of Religion; and it is by the&s;e that even from the prophane and injudicious Part of them a &s;ecret Re|verence is drawn.</P>
<P>All Men are apt to admire tho&s;e of ex|alted Abilities and &s;uperiour to their own. Truths di&s;plaid and defended by &s;uch Ad|vocates enter deep into the Hearts of the Hearers; the Convictions of their own Minds can't fail of drawing their A&s;&s;ent to them: And whether the Want of &s;uch Endowments has not very often given Oc|ca&s;ion both to the Contempt of &s;ome of the Clergy and Religion, I will leave every one to determine as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>The Generality of the better Sort of the Laity (whatever may be thought of them by &s;ome) neither want Learning, good Sen&s;e, or kind Inclinations. They are as quick-&s;ighted as any whatever, are as good Judges of Men, and plea&s;ed with Merit whenever they find it; but if thro' Neglect or Supinene&s;s the Clergy &s;ink be|low their proper Standard they mu&s;t not expect to conceal their Ignorance and Meanne&s;s, nor think them&s;elves injured, if
<PB N="28" REF="27">
Re&s;pect is withdrawn from them; &s;ince, when the Ca&s;e is thus, they are not un|ju&s;tly dealt by; for the Laity then have a Right to Re&s;entment and to complain; their Intere&s;t is concern'd; the Relation which the Clergy &s;tand in to them as &s;pi|ritual Guides will be their Ju&s;tification. For if a Gentleman might ju&s;tly cen&s;ure and contemn his Lawyer or Phy&s;ician who &s;hould puzzle his Title to his E&s;tate or endanger his Life thro' Blunders, much greater Rea&s;on has he to think meanly of tho&s;e who are &s;o ill qualified to take Care of his Soul, which is of infinitely greater Value. But to have done with this:</P>
<P>Let us then &s;uppo&s;e a due Application and Improvement to have been made; and that the young Divine &s;ets out in the World with all laudable Accompli&s;hments; and that he is upon the Stock of the&s;e a|lone to make his future Fortune. Being thus prepared I will not &s;end him down into the Country to a Curacy (tho' that is the Lot at fir&s;t of many worthy and de|&s;erving young Men) but will bring him in|to the World, and place him in the Way to Preferment; among&s;t the great, the
<PB N="29" REF="28">
rich, and di&s;tingui&s;h'd Part of Mankind; and who are likewi&s;e able to di&s;tingui&s;h Merit in others and have Power to re|ward it.</P>
<P>Let him be fix'd then in the Metropo|lis! It may be thought that now I have got him here, I may de&s;ign to li&s;t him a|mong the City Drudges. Nothing le&s;s I can a&s;&s;ure you! I have more Regard for Merit.</P>
<P>In this de&s;ireable and happy Situation, being &s;tocked with a &s;ufficient Portion of Learning, Rhetoric, and Eloquence, it is likely e'er long (by an artful Management of them) that he may attract the Eyes of his Superiours; and that they may begin to look upon him as a Per&s;on that ought to be taken Notice of. The expected and lucky Hour now approaches, and the young Man is pitch'd upon perhaps to be Chaplain to &s;ome great Man, that a &s;in|gle Patron may engro&s;s all the Merit: Or if he happens to be more popular than or|dinary, the united Voice of Numbers may compliment him with a Lecture&s;hip in Town. Let us then &s;urvey him in both the&s;e Situations; whether he have the
<PB N="30" REF="29">
one or the other, as likewi&s;e in their Sequel.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then we will &s;uppo&s;e him taken into the Family of &s;ome great Man for his Chaplain; that is as one who is to look af|ter the Concerns of Religion in the Fami|ly; a &s;piritual Steward, who by Virtue of his Office is as much oblig'd to take Care of my Lord's &s;piritual Affairs, as his tem|poral Steward of his E&s;tate; and is not to let him or his Family (without Warning or thro' his Neglect) &s;quander, or keep be|hind hand too much with Heaven, and run into Arrears; becau&s;e &s;ome Time or other he may be called to an Account for it if he does. If we &s;uppo&s;e a Chaplain without this Privilege, he is but a Cy|pher; and like a Piece of old Plate in a Family, which &s;erves only to adorn and grace a Side-Table, but is of no further U&s;e.</P>
<P>But fancy for once that my Lord &s;hould not be in a Di&s;po&s;ition for Prayer, and that he may have &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s in this World, that he may not have Leizure to hear any thing about another; and that it would be thought impertinent and be
<PB N="31" REF="30">
in vain to talk any thing to him about it; and that his Family (willing to imitate &s;o &s;hining an Example) might think them|&s;elves likewi&s;e better employed. I don't know of any Remedy in this Ca&s;e, but be|ing content to &s;ay Grace (if he can pre|vail &s;o far as to do this) when my Lord dines alone: For at publick Times, I &s;up|po&s;e it of Cour&s;e, it being Part of the Pomp.</P>
<P>O happy Change of Times! for he may not only &s;ay Grace, but &s;it down at Ta|ble too; and that for the mo&s;t Part as long as others. This then has &s;ilenced the Wits and bilk'd them of their Satire; and they would be glad, now the Tables are turn'd, to exchange their Jokes for &s;ome of the De&s;ert.</P>
<P>No, he does not withdraw, and creep about like a Thief in a Corner, and watch the Table narrowly, 'till &s;ome compa&s;&s;io|nate Gue&s;t conde&s;cends to &s;lide him a Sweet-meat; but with a mode&s;t Mein, fingers among the re&s;t; tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd that the Doubtfulne&s;s of his Ti|tle abates &s;ome of his A&s;&s;urance; it being
<PB N="32" REF="31">
rather by Courte&s;y than by Right that he takes.</P>
<P>At other Times, if he is a Man of &s;ome tolerable Addre&s;s, he may be per|mitted to help to &s;pend &s;ome of my Lord's retired Hours; and here the Foundation of his future Fortune is to be laid. If his Conver&s;ation plea&s;es, and his Demeanour &s;trikes his Patron's Fancy, his Bu&s;ine&s;s is done; and happy is it for him, if this comes to pa&s;s free from Incumbrances; and no contracted Stains pollute his Vir|tue, nor any poor Female Relation of the Family or favourite <HI>Abigail</HI> bla&s;t his pro|mi&s;ing Hopes.</P>
<P>Some very good Benefice we will &s;up|po&s;e then is de&s;igned for him; and that when it falls he is put into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and that (as a good Shepherd partly careful of his Flock, and partly tir'd with Attendance and Dependance) he goes down and re&s;ides upon it.</P>
<P>All Cares, now his Wants are &s;upplyed, may be thought at an End; And that he has nothing more to think of (along with his Duty and his Studies) but the Enjoy|ment of him&s;elf. This one would think
<PB N="33" REF="32">
very rea&s;onable, and what might be ex|pected; but for all this there may, and in all Probability will be an unexpected Af|ter-Game. Is he &s;ure of his Dues after he has got his Benefice? That he has a legal and ju&s;t Title to his Tithes (as clear as any Man has to his E&s;tate or Goods,) is mo&s;t certain; and likewi&s;e as good a Re|medy for the Recovery of them.</P>
<P>In &s;hort is there not &s;ome one or more &s;turdy, covetous Pea&s;ant in his Pari&s;h? The &s;hort Character of whom, take from Dr. <HI>South;</HI> who &s;ays, <HI>Nothing is &s;o rude and in&s;olent as a wealthy Ru&s;tick.

<PB N="34" REF="33">
any other fraudulent tricking Way: You may as well venture to take a Lamb (ravi|&s;hed from your Flock) out of the Mouth of a Wolf, as to meddle with this old Sa|crilegious.</P>
<P>Handle him but ever &s;o gently and he cries out he is pinch'd: And that you are rapacious and greedy; and that if you don't take Care he will be even with you: And it is ten to one, but that he is &s;o: For a whole Volume would hardly con|tain all the little Arts the&s;e Mi&s;ers invent (at the In&s;tigation of their Malice) to ef|fect this; and therefore I &s;han't trouble you with a Hi&s;tory of them.</P>
<P>But abating the Unea&s;ine&s;s which mu&s;t &s;ometimes ari&s;e from this ill U&s;age; yet what a hopeful Pro&s;pect have you of the Succe&s;s of your Mini&s;try? What a mighty Influence will it be &s;ure in particular to have over this old Cormorant? Who if alone, it would not be &s;o much Matter; but becau&s;e of his Circum&s;tances, you can't expect him to be without Depen|dants and Adherents, and perhaps a pret|ty many too. For take this for certain that the Merits of the Cau&s;e will not be
<PB N="35" REF="34">
examined into; and it is more likely that the Sheep will follow one another (even tho' a &s;cabby one is their Leader,) than that they will follow their Shepherd.</P>
<P>This then you &s;ee may be &s;ome Check upon your promi&s;ing Hopes of future Ea&s;e, Satisfaction, and Quiet. But happy would it be for you was this the only Impedi|ment. For what if you &s;hould find in your Pari&s;h a pretty large Collection of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters? You may be very &s;anguine and laugh at this indeed; and a&s;k what Danger is there from &s;uch con|&s;cientious Men? Before, it is true, when you had to deal with one who&s;e Con&s;ci|ence Avarice had devoured, &s;ome Evil might naturally en&s;ue; but in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, it is not likely: For with whom could we wi&s;h to have Commerce &s;ooner than with Men of &s;o much Purity? I wi&s;h your Security does not entangle you. Would you like to have &s;o many Spies upon all your Actions? This you may judge to be &s;o far from being any Inconve|nience, that it will be an Incitement to you to have a &s;tricter Guard over your|&s;elf; and, by that Means draw Advantage
<PB N="36" REF="35">
from what looked untowardly at fir&s;t. But will Innocence be always a Protection to you? Or was ever Man &s;o innocent as not to be guilty of daily Slips? The&s;e Failings, then to which human Nature &s;ubjects us all, you may expect to have blaz'd abroad and perhaps magnified; and this too out of religious Zeal, and in or|der to make Pro&s;elytes.</P>
<P>For no Men are more diligent that Way than the&s;e our Prote&s;tant Brethren: And there is no Way more likely for them to gain their Ends by, than by undermining you in the good Opinion of your People. For even the Vulgar pretend to be Judges of Mens Actions; will decide upon them, tho' they are far from being able to judge of the Merits of the Cau&s;e in Di&s;pute be|tween the Di&s;&s;enters and us. By this Means then you &s;ee you may in all Proba|bility have &s;ome of your Flock purloin'd from you: And this I am &s;ure you would not very well like. For &s;ome Mortification it mu&s;t needs be to &s;ee them exult and tri|umph with Joy over any of your poor con|verted Sheep, tho' ever &s;o mean and ig|norant.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36">But you may imagine that a little wary Conduct may place you upon better Terms with them; and a little Conde&s;cen&s;ion bring you nearer together; and that you are not too &s;tiff they will like you the bet|ter. Now you begin indeed to be &s;ome|thing nearer the Matter; and to &s;hew your&s;elf to be a Man of a calm Head; and promi&s;e fair to be popular in Time: For to become all Things to all Men, is very engaging. I &s;uppo&s;e then to plea&s;e them, you will in your Di&s;cour&s;es or Wri|tings model the Sacraments according to their liking, throw down Inclo&s;ures, level the Pa&s;tors of the Church of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and tell them that the Differences between them and us are only nominal. This in|deed would be obliging, might merit their Attention a little, and would make them begin to think that you was a Man of &s;ome Grace. But if this is all you would do, they would hardly believe you to be thoroughly in earne&s;t: Nay they would think that you had more of a Courtier in you than a Primitive Chri&s;tian. For what true Value could they have for &s;uch a lukewarn Advocate as you, even if you
<PB N="38" REF="37">
was a Prelate, whil&s;t you &s;et fa&s;t in your Stall, and won't &s;urrender it, or Part of it, as well as your Principles?</P>
<P>They will compare you to a Man that looks out of his Window from a warm Room in cold Weather, and &s;ees &s;everal poor Objects &s;tarving without, and cries out I have a good Opinion of you; be warm my Brethren, but will not admit them in as Partners to &s;hare with him in his good Fire.</P>
<P>I don't know what can make the Di&s;|&s;enters think them&s;elves more treacherou&s;|ly dealt with than &s;uch U&s;age, &s;ince it is directly &s;triking at the Root of a darling Doctrine of &s;ome of them, which is <HI>that the Saints &s;hould inherit the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>This double Dealing then won't long &s;erve your Turn. They will &s;mell you out in Time, and think you as bad as the re&s;t. For if you will only undermine your Go&s;pel Right, but &s;till hold your le|gal Right; how are they the nearer to the Ends they aim at? Either then don't be quite &s;o complai&s;ant, or be more &s;o, and give up all at once, and then you will get rid of all your Troubles together; but

<P>I have heard (but the Ca&s;e is not exact|ly parallel becau&s;e it was upon his Preach|ing upon Approbation) of a Man (who af|terwards made a very good Figure in the learned World) that lo&s;t one of the&s;e Lecture&s;hips in Town, for chu&s;ing the&s;e Words for his Text, <HI>let him that &s;tole, &s;teal no more:</HI> And if I am not mi&s;taken the major Part of the Electors at that Time were Vintners and Taylors.</P>
<P>Caution and Circum&s;pection are there|fore requi&s;ite, and if a Man have a Mind to plea&s;e, that Saying, <HI>that the Truth ought not to be &s;poken at all Times,</HI> can never be more applicable than in his pre&s;ent Station: If it was not for that nece&s;&s;ary Thing called Duty.</P>
<P>We have all heard of the Court Chaplain, who thought it ill Manners to mention Hell and Damnation in the King's Chap|pel. Such har&s;h Words he might imagine would &s;ound oddly in &s;uch illu&s;trious Ears; they might indeed (in his Opinion) be pro|per enough in &s;ome mean inferior Congre|gations, where the threatning to &s;end them

<P>Where there are &s;uch Numbers of People, as are to be &s;een in &s;ome of the Churches in the City; a great Part of whom abound in Wealth, with which we all of us are too apt to be intoxicated: And among&s;t whom (notwith&s;tanding they meet in the &s;ame Place) there are &s;uch great Diver&s;ities in Opinion, that I don't know a harder Ta&s;k than a Lecturer (I'll &s;ay Incumbent, whom I take to be on the &s;ame Foot in &s;everal Re&s;pects) has to adju&s;t nicely the&s;e Difficulties; and to be|have him&s;elf with &s;uch Di&s;cretion &s;o as not to offend.

<P>Here will open to us one of the mo&s;t ridiculous Scenes we have hitherto met with, and which will require &s;ome Ma|nagement too. Have you never &s;een at the&s;e Invitations a little pert Fellow in a laced Wa&s;t-Coat or perhaps plain, newly arrived perchance from abroad, or perhaps lately redeemed from behind the Counter by the Death of &s;ome Relation who had no more Sen&s;e than to leave the Blockhead a plentiful Fortune to &s;pend? If you have not already &s;een him, it is odds but you will find him at one of the&s;e merry Meetings.</P>
<P>You may go all the World over, and not meet with &s;o ridiculous an Object as this is; unle&s;s it be of the &s;ame Species and Shape.</P>
<P>This Thing, who does not know where he is, or what he is; or how to take one
<PB N="43" REF="42">
regular Step: Yet being naturally dully pert, and perhaps told by his new Foot|man, or his old &s;edentary computing Com|rades or others, that it is high Time for him to &s;et up for a Gentleman; he begins to be of their Mind; and becau&s;e a Gen|tleman &s;hould have &s;omething be&s;ides the Benevolence of Fortune to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the Herd; he therefore &s;ets up for a Wit too. And what &s;o fit to &s;et out with, as with the Contempt of Religion and the Clergy? Take Care of your&s;elf therefore, or he will be upon you. He will &s;o Doctor you about, that you'll have &s;carcely Time to put one Mor&s;el into your Mouth without being a&s;k'd &s;ome imper|tinent Que&s;tion. Or he will fling at the Bottle-Screw, or <HI>nolo Epi&s;copari,</HI> (if he has learn'd to &s;ound the Words) or &s;ome other trifling &s;tale Topick, which I &s;hould be a&s;ham'd &s;o much as to mention, could I think of the&s;e Reptiles without it.</P>
<P>But hold a little; perhaps he may have got the Names of &s;ome of the Articles of Faith or &s;ome of the Ceremonies of the Church; I mention the Names, becau&s;e I can a&s;&s;ure you that he knows no more of
<PB N="44" REF="43">
them or their Meaning than he does of one Word in the <HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> or any other Language but what his Mother or Nur&s;e taught him.</P>
<P>Granting all this; yet how do you think to manage with this Animal? You will &s;ay, I &s;uppo&s;e, being a Man of Learning and Sen&s;e, that you heartily de&s;pi&s;e him. There's Rea&s;on in this I confe&s;s; but will this &s;top his Mouth? Or are there not &s;ometimes in the Company, &s;ome who are as weak and vain as him&s;elf; and who be|ing void of good Sen&s;e and good Man|ners may be pleas'd with his Ribaldry and Impertinence, and may therefore laugh heartily at it? Or are there not even &s;ome &s;ober, wi&s;e and thinking People in Com|pany with you, who may nt be entirely a|ver&s;e to this Babling? You may think that they have too much Wit to be pleas'd; and &s;o they have to be pleas'd with the Man, they having the &s;ame contemptible Opinion of the Wretch that you have. But are you certain that all this while they don't laugh in their Sleeves? For to &s;ee a proud Prie&s;t mortified (which is the com|mon
<PB N="45" REF="44">
Appellation) is very bewitching, let it be done how it will.</P>
<P>Tell me now if you &s;it altogether ea|&s;y notwith&s;tanding? Or whether &s;ome of your Satisfaction is not abated? If it is not, you have a mighty Frame of Spirits; for mo&s;t Men tho' bark'd at by the mo&s;t piti|ful little Mongrill Curr are under &s;ome Concern for their Heels; and the Braying of the A&s;s is di&s;agreeable, tho' every one knows the Nature of the Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>This then is an Evil which will for e|ver haunt you in the City. Nothing is &s;o common as the&s;e whifling Creatures a|bout Town. They are as con&s;tant at En|tertainments, as Flies at the Shambles.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, are not the great Men of our Church a Sovereign Antidote, even again&s;t all Degrees of this Sort of Vermin? Do not the <HI>Hare's,</HI> and <HI>Bentley's,</HI> like Sun|beams acting on Pe&s;tilential Vapours di&s;|per&s;e and make clear all around? So far I will agree with you that nothing can be keener than their Penns, and that they are Terrors to all the &s;cribbling Part of the Fraternity; but the Bablers are left to the inferiour Clergy. If you can find a Re|medy
<PB N="46" REF="45">
for the&s;e, you will exceed the whole College of Phy&s;icians: For when the Pin|eal Gland is di&s;ordered they are all at a Lo&s;s where to cut to make a Cure. You mu&s;t therefore at la&s;t turn them over a|mong&s;t the incurables, as &s;uch virulent Scabs in the Body Politick, which Dr. <HI>Ward</HI> him&s;elf (was he in your Condition) would hardly venture to undertake.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget another Part of the inferior Clergy, and tho&s;e of them too, who promi&s;e the faire&s;t of any for an Ex|emption; I mean tho&s;e of great Fami|lies and good Fortunes of their own, and who are therefore Independent.</P>
<P>The&s;e I confe&s;s are as happy, as they that have got Cloaks in rainy Weather, when others have none. But when the Storm hangs heavy over their Heads, it is odds but they will feel &s;ome of the Damp.</P>
<P>A Bungler can never gain Credit in a|ny Profe&s;&s;ion; nor can a Journeyman a|tone for the Ma&s;ter's Defects. If then they will take (as they in Con&s;cience ought) the Duty and Service of their Function up|on them&s;elves, they mu&s;t have the &s;ame
<PB N="47" REF="46">
Quali|fications with others, and u&s;e the &s;ame La|bour to attain them; or expect to become Objects of Ridicule and Deri&s;ion; and the more too on the Account of their Di|&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Every one will be inqui&s;itive, and a&s;k how it comes to pa&s;s (if they can have any Plea for the Que&s;tion) that one who might have liv'd comfortably without the Reve|nues of the Church, &s;hould thru&s;t him&s;elf into it only for the Sake of them? So far then are &s;uch from being at Liberty to in|dulge, or to be indolent and negligent in their Office, or in the qualifying for it; that they have rather a Spurr to it beyond o|thers; becau&s;e they may be &s;uppos'd to be in the faire&s;t Way to the highe&s;t Prefer|ments of the Church. To aim at which without all the laudable Qualities nece&s;|&s;ary for them, would be a Reproach on them&s;elves; and if they &s;hould get them would be &s;uch a Stain on the Church, as none who have any Regard to any thing further than them&s;elves would be willing to throw upon it. For all tho&s;e who have a true Love for Religion or our Church, wi&s;h to &s;ee none in the highe&s;t Stations of

it; but Men remarkable for Learning, Or|thodoxy, Morality, and Integrity. Such Men alone can be its Ornament, Credit, and Support; who rather ca&s;t a Lu&s;tre on their Office than their Office on them; and if &s;uch are to be found among&s;t tho&s;e of high Birth and Fortune, and they are placed at the Head of the Church, it is &s;till an Addition to its Glory.</P>
<P>Our Church therefore with open Arms embraces Youth of Rank and Di&s;tinction, who are willing to enter into it; and are drawn by the true Motive (which ought to induce any to it) the Love which they have for the Service of God and Religion. But we live in an Age &s;unk below the Standard of former Ages, and in which a great many are unacquainted with the Hi|&s;tory of them. I mention this becau&s;e it is the ea&s;ie&s;t Thing in the World to prove, that Men of the greate&s;t Families in all King|doms, and in all Religions have been Prie&s;ts. But in our polite and refined Times it is accounted (by a great many) &s;ome Di&s;grace and a Le&s;&s;ening to a Gen|tleman; and it is well for him, if he can keep up his former Rank after he has taken

this Character upon him&s;elf. The Cau&s;e of this you &s;hould enquire after, and a&s;k them to give a Rea&s;on for their Opinion; it mu&s;t be this or they have none, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is a Di&s;grace to be more immedi|ately employed in the Service of the great God of Heaven and Earth.</P>
<P>It is plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve, what a Value &s;ome bruti&s;h &s;en&s;ele&s;s Clowns &s;et upon them&s;elves; I mean by Name, your rural E&s;quires the u&s;ele&s;s debauched and dreggy Part of them only; tho&s;e of them who have been educated in the Stable or Dog-Ken|nel; and who&s;e Capacities and Habits are (agreeable to what they have been brought up to) mean and low. Be not &s;urpriz'd! Yet for&s;ooth a Prie&s;t (tho' of Family and Fortune, and adorn'd with all the fine Ac|compli&s;hments which Nature and a gene|rous Education can be&s;tow on him) mu&s;t look to him&s;elf, that he be not elbowed by the&s;e: And it would be taken very much ami&s;s I can a&s;&s;ure him, if he &s;hould be &s;o bold as to a&s;&s;ume the Preference; or &s;o much as an Equality with them.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall la&s;tly take a View of tho&s;e of my Brethren of the Clergy who are
<PB N="50" REF="49">
immured in Colleges, and have at pre&s;ent few of tho&s;e forementioned Difficulties to &s;truggle with: And happy would it be for them, if they had none to encounter. But &s;uch is our Fate, that there is no &s;ecure Refuge for us.</P>
<P>Penury we all know is a Demon which haunts the&s;e Walls: And well would it be for them, if Syllogi&s;ms and Metaphy|&s;icks could &s;atisfy their Appetites and &s;up|port Nature; but I am afraid they will be found to be too &s;ubtle for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>By far the Majority of the Fellows of Colleges are in Circum&s;tances below Envy; in&s;omuch that it is &s;urprizing to find that any &s;hould grudge them the poor Pittance they enjoy; or &s;hould think that College Lands might be canton'd out to better U|&s;es. For if Learning is the greate&s;t Orna|ment, nay Support of a Nation: And if the Univer&s;ities are the Fountains from whence are chiefly derived all the Bene|fits which flow down to the Nation in ge|neral by it: If the three learned Faculties are from hence &s;o ably &s;upplied, that Re|ligion in its Primitive Purity is preached and propagated, that Ju&s;tice is with &s;o
<PB N="51" REF="50">
much Skill and Impartiality maintain'd and di&s;tributed; and al&s;o that the Pre&s;er|vation of our Health and Recovery of it is &s;o well provided for: We may conclude that none but tho&s;e who are Enemies to Mankind in general can be Enemies to the&s;e learned and venerable Bodies.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t all the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings are con|veyed from hence, a great many of the learned Sages re&s;iding there, and from whom they &s;pring, are very poorly reward|ed for their great Labour and Study. What they have at pre&s;ent bears no Proportion to their Merits: And if hereafter any thing happens in their Favour, it is generally too late; not 'till overmuch Study has ex|hau&s;ted their Spirits, and Want of Health has di&s;abled them from Enjoyment.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides their con&s;tant and a&s;&s;iduous Ap|plication to Books has taken their Thoughts off &s;o much from the World, that they are but little acquainted with it: In&s;omuch that when they come out into it, they are for the mo&s;t Part ill prepared to &s;truggle with the Difficulties, they are like to meet with. They are Strangers to all the little Tricks and Artifices, the Windings and Turnings
<PB N="52" REF="51">
of tho&s;e with whom they are likely to have Commerce; and may not &s;u&s;pect there to be any latent Guile in tho&s;e who&s;e Appearance is &s;o mean and unpromi&s;ing: Yet tho' it may appear &s;omething like a Paradox, many a Man of the greate&s;t Learn|ing, Sagacity, and Penetration has been mo&s;t abominably impos'd on, and defraud|ed in worldly Traffick; by tho&s;e who&s;e Capacities are but little &s;uperiour to &s;ome Brutes: The Thoughts of the one being wholly taken up with higher and more no|ble Contemplations, and the others con|fin'd only to the Invention of little Shifts and Di&s;gui&s;es.</P>
<P>It may be expected perhaps (now I have fini&s;hed what I de&s;igned in Re&s;pect of the inferiour Clergy) that I &s;hould go on, and &s;urvey the &s;uperiour Clergy, and make &s;ome amends for what I have already done: But that I &s;hall defer 'till I have &s;een the Succe&s;s of this Undertaking.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<PB N="53" REF="52">
<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>TO confirm the Truth of what I have a&s;&s;erted, I appeal to Ob&s;ervation and Experience, and call upon living Wit|ne&s;&s;es and Sufferers to bear Te&s;timony; of whom I am afraid that there are too many to be found, more by a great many than I could wi&s;h, and who&s;e Calamities I hear|tily lament. Who&s;e Calamities are owing to ungenerous Treatment; to a wicked and perver&s;e Humour in &s;ome of the Lai|ty; Part of whom are &s;educed by a vitious Avarice and Covetou&s;ne&s;s; and others by a vain and &s;u&s;picious Dread of Emulation or they dont know what; and both of them fighting again&s;t divine Authority
<PB N="54" REF="53">
and Di&s;pen&s;ations, and defying the Armies of the living God.</P>
<P>Rea&s;ons for this we are to expect none; neither can any be given. For if at lea&s;t the Majority of the Clergy (without Flat|tery) bear Characters for Abilities in their Function, Inoffen&s;ivene&s;s of Behaviour, and Integrity of Life, &s;uperior to mo&s;t Men, inferior to none; what is there to be urged in Defence of &s;uch barbarous U&s;age? En|vy could it ever cea&s;e, it &s;hould be then, when it &s;ees Men in Di&s;tre&s;s. Could Slan|der be ever &s;ilent, Innocence &s;hould &s;trike it dumb. But wicked and vain Men are Proof again&s;t human and divine Admoni|tions, and nothing will reclaim them.</P>
<P>However, (Coxcombs of every Educa|tion being fir&s;t excluded) to their Hon|our will I &s;peak it, that the greate&s;t Men, I don't mean by Birth only, but who are great in them&s;elves, and who&s;e noble na|tural Endowments and innate good Di&s;|po&s;itions have been improved by a Uni|ver&s;ity Education, are very &s;eldom guilty of Ridicule and Male Treatment; or if at any Time they give into the fir&s;t, their Wit and Humour in &s;ome Mea&s;ure atones
<PB N="55" REF="54">
for it: There being as much Difference between the Treatment of the&s;e, and that of your proud, ignorant, rich, &s;plenetick Fellows, as there is between the fine Hand of a skillful Chirurgeon, and the cour&s;e Mangling of a Butcher.</P>
<P>Unrea&s;onably trouble&s;ome it is very true that the&s;e latter are to their Betters; but if Good could be once brought out of E|vil, and they &s;hould &s;erve at la&s;t as Scare-Crows to keep off from the Church, &s;uch as might otherwi&s;e be more u&s;efully em|ployed, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I &s;hould then have a &s;omething more favourable Opini|on of them than I have hitherto had. But if we can't make this U&s;e of them, we &s;hall be troubled to account for them, and may &s;ay as the hone&s;t Chee&s;emonger &s;aid by the Rats, I wonder for what u&s;e the&s;e Vermin were made.</P>
<P>Enough I hope has been &s;aid to le&s;&s;en the Number of unskillful Traders in Di|vinity, and to keep them from venturing when they are &s;ure to meet with Storms, and to be di&s;appointed of their imaginary Gains.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="55">Nothing however of this Nature will affright the pious and ingenious Youth from this his de&s;igned Undertaking. He knows that God into who&s;e Service, he enli&s;ts him&s;elf, is able to protect him, and therefore re&s;olves to &s;erve him faithfully; and as he hopes to be able to do him bet|ter Service this Way, than any other, he expects a greater Reward for it; but not till his Service is ended; not till the pro|per Time for it comes, and therefore waits patiently for it.</P>
<P>He calls to mind the Dangers, Oppre&s;|&s;ions and Per&s;ecutions of old, and even which have all along attended tho&s;e who have been &s;trictful faithful and diligent in the Service of God; and as he in no wi&s;e expects to be exempted from all of the&s;e, he is the le&s;s &s;urpriz'd and dejected on that Account when they happen to him.</P>
<P>Tran&s;ported with the glorious Figure which the Martyrs and Sufferers make in the Annals of the Church, he has an ho|ne&s;t Ambition of being enrolled (if called upon) among&s;t their Number. Their Characters &s;hining brighter in his Eyes than all the glittering Trophies of your
<PB N="57" REF="56">
<HI>Alexanders</HI> and <HI>Coe&s;ars.</HI> The one having had for their Foundation a fervent Zeal for the Service of God; the others a viti|ous Ambition which lead them on to Ra|pine, Sacrilege, and Murder.</P>
<P>A Heathen or Infidel may indeed ap|plaud the fal&s;e Glory of the latter; but the Chri&s;tian Hero views their black Crimes with Horrour, and di&s;dains any Conque&s;ts but in the Service of God, and the Defence of true Religion.</P>
<P>The Ambition of the Youth that enters into the Mini&s;try with an hone&s;t Heart, is to encourage and promote Piety and Virtue and all Manner of good Works; and to per&s;wade as many as he can to the Practice of them that they may be there|by happy and God from thence be glori|fied; and if this is brought to pa&s;s thro' his Means his De&s;ires are &s;atisfied and he reflects on him&s;elf with greater Plea&s;ure, and is much happier (even amid&s;t Calum|nies Abu&s;es, and the Pre&s;&s;ure of a low Fortune) than if by ba&s;e Compliances and Prophe&s;ying &s;mooth Things he had at|tained to the highe&s;t Dignity. Not
<PB N="58" REF="57">
that I think a Steadine&s;s in his Duty to be an ab&s;olute Bar to Preferment; becau&s;e that (with &s;ome forementioned Qualifications) is in my Opinion the only true Title to it; and I hope that the World is not yet &s;o degenerate as generally to think or act otherwi&s;e. However Pre|ferment is not the &s;tronge&s;t Bya&s;s of a truly good Clergyman; for one who really is &s;o, is content without it, or pleas'd with it according as he finds it incon&s;i&s;tent or con&s;i&s;tent with his Duty. The Di&s;charge of which is the ultimate End which he aims at in this World, and the Rudder which directs all his Actions. Could the Church be always filled with &s;uch, &s;he would &s;oon become the Prai&s;e of the whole Earth. And all true Lovers of our <HI>Sion</HI> will join with me in my hearty Wi|&s;hes, that &s;he may never more want &s;uch.</P>
