<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TIS a very great Plea|&s;ure to me, in an Age where Vice is looked
on as a Kind of fa&s;hionable Accom|pli&s;hment, to hear of one young
Gentleman, who is not a&s;hamed of being &s;ingularly good; who has a Tear for
Pity, and a Hand open as Day for melting Charity, without any &s;ini&s;ter
Views; and who has happily united the Fine Gentleman to the Good
Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">The&s;e, Sir, are unfading Honours! the&s;e &s;hall
embalm and &s;anctify your Name on Earth; and, when this tran&s;ient Scene is
pa&s;t, be a &s;weet and acceptable Sacrifice to God.</P>
<P>That your Virtues may long adorn and ble&s;s this World, and
receive a full and glorious Re|compence in the next, is the ardent Prayer
of,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is u&s;ual with all Au|thors to write Prefaces, either to beg
the Ap|plau&s;e of the Public, or el&s;e, 
<Q> 
<L>By Way of filling,</L> 
<L>To rai&s;e their Volume's Price a Shilling.</L></Q> As a
mo&s;t eminent Poet is &s;aid to have done.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">I own, if the Merit of any Writer is to be
judged by the Number of Sheets they have written, I have very little Pretence
to Favour: But as 
<Q> 
<L>Multum in Parvo,</L></Q> is an Expre&s;&s;ion of an ancient
Poet, I hope my Readers will excu&s;e me, as I would rather have them ri&s;e
from Table with an Appetite, than glut them; a Rule of Temperance equally
conducive to the Health of our Minds as of our Bodies.</P>
<P>I once had the Misfortune of wri|ting for a Printer, who never
exa|mined the Merit of the Work, but u&s;ed to mea&s;ure it, and tell me, it
would not do at all, except I could &s;end him half a Dozen Yards more of the
&s;ame Stuff: And, as Dr. <HI>Young</HI> remarks, on large Folios, well gilt
and bound, <PB N="vii" REF="6"> very proper to adorn a Library, whe|ther the
Owner of it can read or write, or not: 
<Q> 
<L>So <HI>Ton&s;on,</HI> turn'd Uphol&s;terer, &s;ends home</L> 
<L>The gilded Leather to adorn the Room.</L></Q></P>
<P>If I am obliged to &s;end my Work in a blue Paper Covering, let
them look on the In&s;ide, which, I flatter my&s;elf, will at lea&s;t amu&s;e
them.</P>
<P>As I wrote the&s;e Memoirs in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> the de&s;cribing
particular Places or Cu&s;toms peculiar to <HI>Ireland,</HI> in order to make
the Work intelligible to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Readers, will, I hope, be
excu&s;ed; for all Countries vary from each other in many Points.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF Mrs. <HI>PILKINGTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALTHO' it has been the com|mon Practice, with Writers of Memoirs,
to fill their Volumes with their own Prai&s;es, which, whatever Plea&s;ure they
may have afforded to the Authors, by indulging their Vanity, are &s;eldom found
to give any to the Readers; I am determined to quit this beaten Track; and by a
&s;trict Adherence to Truth, plea&s;e even my greate&s;t Enemies, by
pre&s;enting them with a lively Picture of all my <HI>Faults,</HI> 
<PB N="2" REF="9"> my <HI>Follies,</HI> and the <HI>Misfortunes,</HI> which
have been con&s;equential to them.</P>
<P>And I am the more inclined to proceed, in that I think the Story
may be in&s;truc|tive to the <HI>Female</HI> Part of my Readers, to teach them
that <HI>Reputation</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>Is the immediate Jewel of their Souls,</L> 
<L>And that the Lo&s;s of it</L> 
<L>Will make them poor indeed!</L><BIBL>Othello.</BIBL></Q> So
that I propo&s;e my&s;elf, not as an Ex|ample, but a Warning to them; that by
my Fall, they may &s;tand the more &s;ecure.</P>
<P>However numerous my Mi&s;takes in Life have been, they have
&s;till had mo&s;t &s;urprizing Additions made to them, not only by ba&s;e and
unworthy Minds, Wretches devoid of Truth and common Hone&s;ty, but al&s;o by
Per&s;ons of high Rank, and &s;uch as outwardly profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity; who
have fancied it an Act of Piety to be|lieve and &s;pread of me the mo&s;t
impro|bable and notorious Fal&s;hoods! nay, &s;o far has their per&s;ecuting
Zeal been carried, that they have rendered my hone&s;t Indu&s;try in|effectual;
<PB N="3" REF="10"> and by depriving me of any Means to &s;upport Life,
endeavoured to make me even &s;uch a one, as they repre|&s;ented me to be: That
Clergymen, and Ladies of Honour, &s;hould unite, in driving to Extremity, a
Per&s;on, who never yet, either in her Conver&s;ation, or Writing, of|fended
again&s;t the Laws of Decency or Hu|manity, is but too apt to make one think,
they had quite forgotten the Chri&s;tian Grace, <HI>Charity,</HI> without which
we are told, all other Virtues are of no Avail, and con|&s;equently, fall far
&s;hort of Perfection them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>I therefore hope tho&s;e who have taken &s;uch unbounded Liberties
with my Charac|ter, will al&s;o allow me to paint out theirs, only with this
Difference, that I &s;hall con|fine my&s;elf to Truth, a Favour I never yet
received at their Hands; &s;ince even the prie&s;tly Robe, and Mitred Head,
have, with Regard to me, di&s;claimed it, of which, in the Series of the&s;e
melancholy Adven|tures, I &s;hall be able to produce many &s;ur|prizing
In&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="11">I was born in the Year 1712; by my Mother's
Side de&s;cended of an antient and honourable Family, who were frequent|ly
intermarried with the Nobility. My Great Grandfather was Earl of
<HI>Killmallock,</HI> who&s;e Daughter married Colonel <HI>Meade,</HI> by whom
he had twenty-one Children, twelve of whom lived to be married. This Gentleman,
to his Honour be it &s;poken, tho' he was a Man of Fortune, and in the Army,
declared on his Death-bed, 
<Q REND="inline">'That he never had, either when a Batche|lor, or a
married Man, criminal Conver|&s;ation with a Woman; never was drunk; never
broke his Word; nor ever u&s;ed Tobacco.'</Q></P>
<P>The late Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> when Lord Lieutenant of
<HI>Ireland,</HI> dining at Colonel <HI>Meade</HI>'s, offered to confer on him
the Ho|nour of Knighthood; but he then being in an advanced Age, declined it
for him&s;elf, telling his Grace, 
<Q REND="inline">'As he was going out of the World, and his
elde&s;t Son coming into it, he would chu&s;e, if he thought pro|per, his Grace
&s;hould be&s;tow it on him:'</Q> Which accordingly he did.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="12">This Gentleman, Sir <HI>John Meade,</HI> was
bred to the Law, and de&s;ervedly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, as one of the fine&s;t
Orators that ever &s;poke at the Bar: He was a perfect Ma&s;ter of
cla&s;&s;ical Learning; and a Lover and Judge of the mu&s;e-like Arts; his
pa|ternal E&s;tate was about Fifteen Hundred Pounds a Year, which was augmented
by marrying &s;ucce&s;&s;ively two great Heire&s;&s;es; as well as by the
va&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s he had in his Profe&s;&s;ion: So that with all tho&s;e
Advan|tages of Nature, Education, and Fortune, it was no Wonder he &s;hould
meet with univer&s;al Re&s;pect and E&s;teem.</P>
<P>He was in this Situation, when Sir <HI>Ed|ward Seymor</HI> had an
E&s;tate of five Thou&s;and Pounds a Year left to him in <HI>Ireland</HI>; this
was a Matter too con&s;iderable for Sir <HI>Ed|ward</HI> to hope immediately to
po&s;&s;e&s;s with|out Law-&s;uit or Difficulty; &s;o that he found his
per&s;onal Appearance ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. It is to be ob&s;erved, that
Sir <HI>Edward Seymor</HI> was accounted the proude&s;t Man in
<HI>England</HI>; and Sir <HI>John Meade</HI> was as remarkable for the &s;ame
Fault; neither indeed did I ever meet with any Per&s;on of <PB N="6" REF="13">
either of tho&s;e Names in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ire|land,</HI> who was not
abundantly &s;tocked with it, tho' without the &s;ame Preten&s;ions to
&s;upport it.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward Seymor</HI> landed at <HI>Dublin,</HI> filled with
that natural Contempt for the whole Country, which tho&s;e of the
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who have not been re&s;ident among&s;t them, are but too
apt to expre&s;s on every Occa|&s;ion: He there found &s;ome of his own
Countrymen in Places of Profit and Tru&s;t, of whom he enquired, 
<Q REND="inline">'Whether there are any &s;uch Things as good
Lawyers to be met with in this damned Place?'</Q></P>
<P>They an&s;wered, 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, very good; but if he hoped to carry his
Cau&s;e, he mu&s;t &s;ee Sir <HI>John Meade:</HI> Well, &s;aid he, let one of
my Footmen go for him.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Your Footman, Sir <HI>Edward!</HI> &s;aid one of
the Gentlemen, who knew Sir <HI>John:</HI> Why, 'tis odds if he will &s;peak to
You. I a&s;&s;ure you, if he does, 'tis a Favour few of his Clients obtain from
him.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What, <HI>a Duce,</HI> return'd he, do
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Lawyers take &s;uch State upon them?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You are to con&s;ider, Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> he is
a Gentle|man <PB N="7" REF="14"> of Family, has a noble Fortune, and is &s;o
eminent in his Profe&s;&s;ion, that &s;hould he be employed again&s;t you, you
may bid Farewel to your Claim.'</Q></P>
<P>This la&s;t Argument had &s;uch Force with Sir <HI>Edward
Seymor,</HI> that he conde&s;cended to wait on Sir <HI>John Meade</HI> next
Morning: Sir <HI>John</HI> had been apprized of what the other had &s;aid; and
re&s;olving to be as &s;tate|ly as him&s;elf, &s;ent him down Word, 
<Q REND="inline">'He was very bu&s;y, but if he plea&s;ed to wait
till he was at Lei&s;ure, he would &s;ee him.'</Q> So Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was
&s;hewn into a Parlour, where he remained above an Hour, fretting him&s;elf to
Death, at this di&s;re&s;pectful U&s;age offered to a Per&s;on of his
Dignity.</P>
<P>When Sir <HI>John</HI> thought he had pretty &s;ufficiently
mortified him, he &s;ent to let him know, he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee him, and
received him with a Politene&s;s natural to him; but when Sir <HI>Edward</HI>
went to open his Ca&s;e to him, he told him, 
<Q REND="inline">'He mu&s;t leave him his Brief, for he could not
&s;pare Time to hear him:'</Q> So Sir <HI>Edward</HI> laid down his Brief, with
a large Pur&s;e of Gold on it; and, having got his Audience <PB N="8" REF="15">
of Leave, departed, full of Indignation at meeting with a Man as proud as
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When the Day appointed for the impor|tant Trial was come, there
were Numbers of Lawyers engaged on either Side of the Que&s;tion: Sir
<HI>John</HI> being, I &s;uppo&s;e, re|&s;olved to try his Client's Patience to
the uttermo&s;t, permitted every one of them to &s;peak before him, without
Interruption, and &s;at drawing Birds with a Pencil, till Sir <HI>Edward</HI>
was ready to bur&s;t with Rage at him, e&s;pecially as he found the Cau&s;e
likely to go again&s;t him: At length, when their Pleadings were ended, and
Judgment going to be pronounced again&s;t Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> Sir <HI>John
Meade</HI> aro&s;e, and de&s;ired to be heard, which he ever was with Favour
and Attention by the Court, when making a Speech, which took an Hour and a half
in Time, he &s;o fully confuted all Sir <HI>Ed|ward</HI>'s Antagoni&s;ts, and
made his Title to the E&s;tate &s;o evident, and with &s;uch power|ful
Eloquence, that he had a Decree to be put in immediate Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was &s;o charmed with Sir <HI>John</HI>'s
graceful Elocution, that he could <PB N="9" REF="16"> not forbear &s;everal
Times crying out in Extacy, <HI>An Angel! by Heaven, an Angel!</HI> But when he
found the happy Effects of it &s;o much to his own Advantage, he could no
longer contain him&s;elf, but cathing Sir <HI>John</HI> in his Arms, <HI>My
dear, dear Friend!</HI> &s;ays he, permit me to have the Honour of calling you
&s;o: I do not wonder you &s;hould be proud, who have more Cau&s;e to be &s;o,
than any Man living.</P>
<P>The Court not breaking up, till it was late, Sir <HI>Edward</HI>
pre&s;&s;ed Sir <HI>John</HI> to give him his Company that Evening; Sir
<HI>John</HI> excu&s;ed him&s;elf, telling him, 
<Q REND="inline">'He was every Night engaged to a Club:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, then, &s;aid Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> if you
will give me Leave, I will accompany you; (pro|vided you think it will be
agreeable to your Friends?)'</Q> Sir <HI>John</HI> an&s;wered, 
<Q REND="inline">'They would all, he was &s;ure, e&s;teem it as a
very great Honour.'</Q> So according|ly Sir <HI>Edward</HI> met them, and they
were mutually delighted with each other's Con|ver&s;ation, we may pre&s;ume, by
their &s;tay|ing together till Four the next Morning. Some of Sir
<HI>Edward</HI>'s Friends finding him <PB N="10" REF="17"> in Bed at Twelve
o'Clock the en&s;uing Day, he told them, 
<Q REND="inline">'He had &s;at up all Night:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'With whom, Sir <HI>Edward?</HI>'</Q> Why,
returned he, 
<Q REND="inline">'With <HI>Homer, Plato, Socrates, Cicero,</HI> and
all the antient <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Poets, Philo&s;ophers and
Hi&s;|torians.'</Q></P>
<P>From this Time, Sir <HI>Edward</HI> and Sir <HI>John</HI>
contracted a Friend&s;hip, which did not terminate, but with their Lives.</P>
<P>As this little Piece of Hi&s;tory redounds to the mutual Honour of
both the&s;e great and eminent Gentlemen; I hope it will not be accounted
Vanity in me to recite it.</P>
<P>One of Sir <HI>John Meade</HI>'s Si&s;ters, being &s;mitten with
the good Mien of a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Officer in King <HI>James</HI>'s
Army, &s;tole a Match with him, of which my Mo|ther was the Fir&s;t-fruits; but
her Mother dying in Childbed of her &s;econd Child, and King <HI>William</HI>
entirely &s;ubduing <HI>Ire|land,</HI> my Grandfather thought proper to follow
his Royal Ma&s;ter's Fortune to <HI>France,</HI> leaving my Mother, then an
In|fant, to the wide World: However, Pro|vidence did not abandon the helple&s;s
Or|phan; <PB N="11" REF="18"> her Grandmother, the Widow of Colonel
<HI>Meade</HI> before-mentioned, took her Home to her; and while &s;he lived,
with true maternal Tenderne&s;s, be&s;towed on her the be&s;t and polite&s;t
Education: And when the Tru&s;tees &s;at in <HI>Ireland,</HI> it being proved
&s;he was bred a Prote&s;tant, &s;he recovered her Mother's Fortune, which had
been &s;ettled on her, and which &s;he had been &s;ome Years kept out of, on
Account of her Father's being a forfeiting Per&s;on.</P>
<P>He, in the mean time, returned privately to <HI>England,</HI> and
married a Niece of the celebrated Je&s;uit Father <HI>Hugh Peters</HI>: by this
&s;econd Venture, he had one Daughter, who was married to Mr. <HI>Fowler</HI>
of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> the &s;ole Heire&s;s of
whom is the pre&s;ent Lady <HI>Faulconbridge,</HI> to whom, were it of any
U&s;e to me, I have the Honour of being a fir&s;t Cou&s;in by the
Half-Blood.</P>
<P>My Mother being now in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hand&s;ome Fortune,
and by the Death of her Grandmother entirely at her own Di&s;|po&s;al, for her
Fathern ever enquired what became of her, did not, it may be &s;up|po&s;ed, 
<PB N="12" REF="19"> want Admirers; e&s;pecially as &s;he had a very graceful
Per&s;on, with Abun|dance of Wit, which was improved by reading and keeping the
be&s;t Company: however, none of them made any Impre&s;&s;ion on her Heart,
till &s;he &s;aw my Father, who was the Son of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Phy&s;ician,
that ac|cidentally &s;ettled in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and who had no other Fortune
to boa&s;t of, than a liberal Education, and a very amiable Per&s;on and
Under&s;tanding; Qualities which recom|mended him to my Mother &s;o powerfully,
that &s;he had Con&s;tancy enough to wait for him three Years, while he went to
<HI>Leyden,</HI> where he &s;tudied Phy&s;ick under the late fa|mous Dr.
<HI>Boerhaave</HI>; and having taken his Degree, he returned to
<HI>Ireland,</HI> uniting him|&s;elf in Marriage to his faithful Mi&s;tre&s;s.
Her Friends were at fir&s;t much di&s;plea&s;ed with her; but my Father's Merit
&s;oon re|conciled them to her Choice; and there being then but one Man-Midwife
in the Kingdom, my Father made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of that u&s;eful Art, and
practi&s;ed it with great Succe&s;s, Reputation, and Huma|nity.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="20">I was their &s;econd Child, and my elde&s;t
Brother dying an Infant, for a long Time their only one; being of a tender
weakly Con&s;titution, I was by my Father greatly indulged; indeed I cannot
&s;ay, but it was in &s;ome Mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould, by his
Gentlene&s;s, qualify my Mother's Severity to me; otherwi&s;e it mu&s;t have
broke my Heart; for &s;he &s;trictly followed <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Advice, in
never &s;paring the Rod; in&s;o|much that I have frequently been whipt for
looking blue of a fro&s;ty Morning; and, whether I de&s;erved it or not, I was
&s;ure of Correction every Day of my Life.</P>
<P>From my earlie&s;t Infancy I had a &s;trong Di&s;po&s;ition to
Letters; but my Eyes being weak, after the Small-pox, I was not permitted to
look at a Book; my Mother regarding more the Beauty of my Face, than the
Improvement of my Mind; nei|ther was I allowed to learn to read: This
Re&s;traint, as it generally happens, made me but more earne&s;t in the
Pur&s;uit of what I imagined mu&s;t be &s;o delightful. Twenty times a Day have
I been corrected, for a&s;k|ing what &s;uch and &s;uch Letters &s;pelt; my 
<PB N="14" REF="21"> Mother u&s;ed to tell me the Word, accom|panying it with a
good Box on the Ear, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, imprinted it on my Mind. Had
<HI>Gulliver</HI> &s;een her Behaviour, I &s;hould have imagined, he had
borrowed a Hint from it for his floating I&s;land, where, when a great Man had
promi&s;ed any Favour, the Suppliant was obliged to give him a Tweak by the
No&s;e, or a Kick on the Rump, to quicken his Memory. However, I do a&s;&s;ure
you, it had this Ef|fect on me, in&s;omuch, that I never forgot what was once
told me; and quickly arrived at my de&s;ired Happine&s;s, being able to read
before &s;he thought I knew all my Letters; but this Plea&s;ure I was obliged
to enjoy by Stealth with Fear and Trembling.</P>
<P>I was at this Time about five Years of Age; and my Mother being
one Day a|broad, I had happily laid hold on <HI>Alexan|der's Fea&s;t,</HI> and
found &s;omething in it &s;o charming, that I read it aloud;&mdash;but how like
a condemned Criminal did I look, when my Father, &s;oftly opening his
Study|door, took me in the very Fact; I dropt my Book, and bur&s;t into Tears,
begging <PB N="15" REF="22"> Pardon, and promi&s;ing never to do &s;o a|gain:
But my Sorrow was &s;oon di&s;pelled, when he bade me not be frightened, but
read to him, which, to his great Surprize, I did very di&s;tinctly, and without
hurting the Beauty of the Numbers. In&s;tead of the whipping, of which I
&s;tood in dread, he took me up in his Arms, and ki&s;&s;ed me, giving me a
whole Shilling, as a Re|ward, and told me, 
<Q REND="inline">'He would give me another, as &s;oon as I got a
Poem by Heart,'</Q> which he put into my Hand, and proved to be Mr.
<HI>Pope</HI>'s &s;acred Ec|logue; which Ta&s;k I performed before my Mother
returned Home. They were both a&s;toni&s;hed at my Memory, and from that Day
forward, I was permitted to read as much as I plea&s;ed; only my Father took
care to furni&s;h me with the be&s;t, and poli|te&s;t Authors; and took Delight
in explain|ing to me, whatever, by Rea&s;on of my tender Years, was above my
Capacity of Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>But chiefly was I charmed and ravi&s;hed with the Sweets of
Poetry; all my Hours were dedicated to the Mu&s;es; and, from a 
<PB N="16" REF="23"> Reader, I quickly became a Writer; I may truly &s;ay with
Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>I li&s;p'd in Numbers, for the Numbers came.</L></Q></P>
<P>My Performances had the good Fortune to be looked on as
extraordinary for my Years; and the greate&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Men in the
Kingdom did not di&s;dain to hear the Prattle of the little Mu&s;e, as they
called me, even in my childi&s;h Days. But as I ap|proached towards Womanhood
there was a new Scene opened to me; and by the Time I had looked on thirteen
Years, I had almo&s;t as many Lovers; not that I ever was hand&s;ome, farther
than being very fair. But I was well-dre&s;t, &s;prightly, and remarkably
well-tempered, unapt to give or take Offence; in&s;omuch that my Com|pany was
generally coveted; and no doubt but I &s;hould have been happily di&s;po&s;ed
of in Marriage, but that my Mother's capri|cious Temper made her reject every
advan|tageous Propo&s;al offered, and at la&s;t con|demn me to the Arms of one
of the great|e&s;t V&mdash;s, with Reverence to the Prie&s;t|hood. 
<PB N="17" REF="24" MS="y"> be it &s;poken, that ever was wrapt up in
Crape.</P>
<P>And here I cannot forbear ob&s;erving, how very few who wear that
S&mdash;d H&mdash;t are adorned with any real Sanctity of Man|ners: What
Ambition, Avarice, Lu&s;t, and Cruelty reigns among them; they are ge|nerally
the fir&s;t Seducers of Innocence (as the Holine&s;s of their Office gives them
free Admittance into every Family) and as &s;oon as they have made a Breach in
the tender Mind for Ruin's wa&s;teful Entrance, (pro|vided they can but &s;lip
their own Necks out of the Halter and remain unexpo&s;ed) they &s;hall be the
fir&s;t to per&s;ecute with Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, and Spiritual
Authori|ty, that very Per&s;on, whom they them|&s;elves fir&s;t taught the Way
to &s;in. 
<Q> 
<L>Let none pre&s;ume to cen&s;ure this as Spite,</L> 
<L>I &s;uffer for their Crimes of whom I write,</L></Q> And 'tis
ever allowed that the Lo&s;ers may have leave to &s;peak.</P>
<P>I would not, by this Reflection, be thought to &s;trike at
Religion, or the valuable Part <PB N="18" REF="25"> of the Clergy: Tho&s;e who
are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Chri&s;tian Charity, and make the Sincerity of their
Faith appear in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of their Life, are truly worthy of
Reve|rence and Honour; but alas! their Num|ber is &s;o few, that the Ears of
Corn are &s;carce di&s;cernable among the Tares, of whom no doubt Satan will
reap a plen|tiful Harve&s;t.</P>
<P>But to return. Among&s;t all tho&s;e who addre&s;t me, my Heart
retained its Freedom; and if their Flattery plea&s;ed me, it was only as it fed
my Vanity; that Pa&s;&s;ion, which, like Pride, is &s;o univer&s;al: I had no
parti|cular Engagement, was entirely &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to my Parents, punctual
to all the Duties of Religion, unaffectedly innocent, and much more plea&s;ed
with my Female Friends, than with the Company of Men.</P>
<P>There were two young Ladies, in parti|cular, for whom, from my
Childhood, I had a very tender Affection, and whom, as often as I could, I
vi&s;ited; as their Brother was a Clergyman, many of the Gown fre|quented their
Hou&s;e, and among&s;t the re&s;t, the Reader of our Pari&s;h-Church, Mr. 
<PB N="19" REF="26"> <HI>P&mdash;n.</HI> He had a good Face, and many agreeable
Accompli&s;hments; as a tolerable Ta&s;te in Mu&s;ic, and a poetical Turn,
which greatly entertained me; but being a Man of ob&s;cure Birth, and low
Fortune, I had no farther Thoughts of him, than merely as an Acquaintance:
However, it was my Misfortune to be liked by him, when I lea&s;t imagined it;
as he played very well on the Organ, he gave us an Invitation to Church,
promi&s;ing, after Evening-Prayer, to &s;ing an Anthem for us. I, who always
delighted in Church-Mu&s;ic, begged my Mother's Per|mi&s;&s;ion to go, which,
with &s;ome Difficulty, I obtained. After the Mu&s;ic he invited us into the
Ve&s;try-Room, where he had prepa|red a little Collation of Fruit, Wine,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;ingling me out, he began to addre&s;s me in a very
pa&s;&s;ionate Stile, and earne&s;tly beg|ged Leave to vi&s;it me: I told him, 
<Q REND="inline">'I was to go into the Country next Day, to &s;tay
all the Summer, and were I not, I had no Male Vi&s;itants, but &s;uch as my
Parents approved of; and con&s;equently it was out of my Power to grant his
Reque&s;t.'</Q> My Mother &s;ending for me, prevented any far|ther 
<PB N="20" REF="27"> Conver&s;ation for that Time; and ear|ly the next Morning
we &s;et out on our in|tended Journey.</P>
<P>During my Stay in the Country, he wrote me a great many poetical
Compli|ments, and &s;ub&s;cribed him&s;elf <HI>Amintas:</HI> As they were
really very elegant, my Mo|ther, who always examined my Letters, expre&s;t
great Curio&s;ity to know the Wri|ter; &s;aying, 
<Q REND="inline">'I ought to return a Letter of Thanks to him:'</Q>
But as I took this only for a Trap, I told her, which was true, I knew not who
it was; le&s;t I &s;hould be denied the Plea&s;ure of vi&s;iting the young
Ladies, where I fir&s;t &s;aw him, if I &s;hould have given her the
&s;malle&s;t Hint, that I gue&s;&s;ed at the Per&s;on.</P>
<P>I had, by this Time, a Brother of about nine Years of Age, of whom
my Father and Mother were fond even to Extrava|gance; whenever I went abroad,
he u&s;ed to cry to go with me, and was con&s;tantly indulged in it.</P>
<P>A few Days after our Return to Town, I went to wait on the young
Ladies before|mentioned, and took my Brother with me; <PB N="21" REF="28"> I
was &s;carce &s;eated when Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> came in; and after &s;aluting
me, began to re|proach me with Cruelty, in never having favoured him with an
An&s;wer to any of his Letters. I told him, 
<Q REND="inline">'I was much obliged to him, for the agreeable
Entertainment they had afforded me; but that, except|ing my Father, I had never
wrote to any Man, neither was I Mi&s;tre&s;s of Wit e|nough to corre&s;pond
with him.'</Q> A good many civil Things were &s;aid on either Hand, during Tea
Time; after which my Brother growing urgent with me to return Home, I happened
to &s;ay he was &s;o great a Favourite, I dur&s;t not contradict him; upon
which, Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> made his Appli|cation to him, and gave him an
Invitation to his Lodgings; where he entertained him &s;o kindly, that the
Child returned in Rap|tures with him; and loaden with Toys and Sweetmeats. Upon
this Civility to my Brother, my Father &s;ent and invited Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> to Dinner; (and you may be &s;ure he did not refu&s;e him)
but quickly found the Art of making him&s;elf &s;o agreeable to my Parents,
that they were even unea&s;y <PB N="22" REF="29"> whenever he was ab&s;ent;
which &s;eldom happened, except when his Duty required his Attendance. He now
began openly to court me; and, to my great Surprize, nei|ther of them feemod
aver&s;e to it; but al|lowed him as much Liberty of conver&s;ing with me, as a
rea&s;onable Man could de&s;ire; and for my own Part, he gained &s;o large a
Share in my E&s;teem, that as they &s;eemed to approve of him, I was very well
&s;atis|fied.</P>
<P>One Year pa&s;t on in this Manner, during which Time, Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> never omitted any Thing to convince me of the Sincerity of
his Pa&s;&s;ion; and tho' he &s;aw me every Day, and all the Day; yet every Day
was &s;till but as the fir&s;t: 
<Q> 
<L>So eager was he &s;till to &s;ee me more.</L></Q></P>
<P>The en&s;uing Spring, my Mother took a Lodging, about a Mile from
<HI>Dublin,</HI> by the Sea-&s;ide, for the Benefit of bathing, where my Father
and Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> came every Afternoon together to vi&s;it us; but my
Father's Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eldom permitting <PB N="23" REF="30"> him to &s;tay
above half an Hour, he gene|rally left Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> with us: Who, one
Night happening to &s;tay later than ordina|ry, left a Gold Watch, and a
hand&s;ome Diamond Ring in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; le&s;t, as he &s;aid, he
&s;hould be robbed of them going Home. My Father and he coming to us the next
Day, (according to Cu&s;tom) I brought to Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> his Ring and
Watch; but he would by no Means ac|cept of either, but in&s;i&s;ted on my
keeping them as a Pre&s;ent; my Father and Mother were both by; and neither of
them &s;hew|ing any Di&s;like to it, I was, with great Reluctance, obliged by
him to take them.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e Particulars, trifling as they are, becau&s;e I
have been accu&s;ed of Di&s;obedience to my Parents, in marrying without their
Con&s;ent or Knowledge; whereas they were acquainted with the Af|fair from
Beginning to End; neither was I any more than pa&s;&s;ive in it; never hav|ing
allowed my&s;elf to have any Will but theirs.</P>
<P>My Father was at this Time &s;o eminent in his Profe&s;&s;ion, and
lived after &s;o elegant <PB N="24" REF="31" MS="y"> a manner, that every body
concluded, he was able to give me a very good Fortune; and few People could
believe he counte|nanced Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s Addre&s;&s;es to me; he
neither having any Preferment in the Church, nor any other Fortune: And
what|ever Merit an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Clergyman may po&s;&s;e&s;s, he has little
Hope of Advancement by it, unle&s;s he has &s;ome Relation in the Hou&s;e of
Commons, who, by betraying the Inte|re&s;t of his Country, can procure for him,

<Q> 
<L>The Leavings of a Church di&s;tre&s;t,</L>

<L>Or &s;ome remote inferior Po&s;t,</L> 
<L>With forty Pounds a Year at mo&s;t.</L><BIBL>Swift.</BIBL></Q>
And in this, the pre&s;ent State of poor <HI>Ire|land</HI> nearly re&s;embles
that of <HI>England,</HI> un|der the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> when, as
&s;oon as a Bi&s;hoprick became vacant, an <HI>Ita|lian</HI> was immediately
nominated to it. <HI>Ireland</HI> groans under the &s;ame Calamity: An
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> V&mdash;y, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Judges, <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Bi&s;hops, with their long Train of Re|lations and Dependants, lay their hard 
<PB N="25" REF="32"> Hands on all Preferments; while her learn|ed Sons
langui&s;h out Life, in hopele&s;s Po|verty and Dejection of Spirit.</P>
<P>I have frequently ob&s;erved it, as a Want of Policy in the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government, to permit the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> to have
an U|niver&s;ity: Learning naturally in&s;pires Men with the Love of Liberty;
the Principles of which ought to be di&s;couraged in the Minds of tho&s;e, whom
their Ma&s;ters are plea&s;ed to condemn to Slavery, Want and Oppre&s;&s;ion;
unle&s;s, perhaps it may be done with a cruel Intent, of making their Yoke the
more galling to them.</P>
<P><HI>Ireland,</HI> while free, was remarkable for producing brave
and valiant Men. Ever witne&s;s for her,

<P><PB N="26" REF="33">I hope I &s;hall be pardoned by all true
Patriots for this Digre&s;&s;ion; if not, I can only make U&s;e of
<HI>Fal&s;taff</HI>'s Apology, <HI>That Rebellion lay in my Way, and I found
it.</HI></P>
<P>But to re&s;ume my Thread. All my Friends and Relations attacked
my Father warmly on this Head; who &s;olemnly de|clared, 
<Q REND="inline">'He knew nothing of any amorous Corre&s;pondence
between Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> and his Daughter, that the Gentleman came to
vi&s;it us, as being Pari&s;hioners:'</Q> But withal declared: 
<Q REND="inline">'Since &s;uch a Report was &s;pread, he would
civilly forbid him the Hou&s;e;'</Q> which accordingly he or|dered my Mother to
do. Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> came as u&s;ual, and my Mother delivered her
dreadful Commi&s;&s;ion to him. No &s;ooner was the fatal Sentence pronounced,
but my a&s;toni&s;hed Lover fell pale and &s;peechle&s;s to the Floor; and to
&s;ay the Truth, my Ca&s;e was little better than his: I rai&s;ed him in my
Arms, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s as he &s;eemed, he gra&s;ped me clo&s;e, and leaned
his drooping Head upon my Bo&s;om; whil&s;t my Mother applied Remedies to 
<PB N="27" REF="34"> him till he revived: When he came to him&s;elf, he blamed
us for our Care: &s;ay|ing, 
<Q REND="inline">'Since I was lo&s;t, he could not, would not
live.'</Q></P>
<P>As I was naturally of a &s;oft compa&s;|&s;ionate Temper, the
Condition I &s;aw him in pierced my very Soul; but I was too much in Awe of my
Mother to venture to &s;ay &s;o at that Time. So he left me with Sorrow deeply
imprinted in his Counte|nance, and, as I believed, in his Heart.</P>
<P>About two Years before this, a young Woman of about eighteen Years
of Age, was brought to my Father, by a Stationer, to be by him in&s;tructed in
Midwifery: She was Mi&s;tre&s;s of <HI>Hebrew, Greek, Latin</HI> and
<HI>French,</HI> under&s;tood the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> as well as mo&s;t Men:
And what made the&s;e extraordinary Talents yet more &s;urprizing, was, that
her Parents were poor illiterate Country People; &s;o that her Learning
ap|peared like the Gift poured out on the A|po&s;tles, of &s;peaking all
Languages, with|out the Pains of Study; or, like the intui|tive Knowledge of
Angels: Yet in as much as the Power of Miracles is cea&s;ed; we 
<PB N="28" REF="35"> mu&s;t allow &s;he u&s;ed human Means for &s;uch great and
excellent Acquirements: And yet in a long Friend&s;hip and Famili|arity with
her, I could never obtain a &s;atis|factory Account from her on this Head; only
&s;he &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'&s;he had received &s;ome little In&s;truction
from the Mini&s;ter of the Pa|ri&s;h, when &s;he could &s;pare Time from her
Needlework, to which &s;he was clo&s;ely kept by her Mother.'</Q> She wrote
elegant|ly both in Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e; and &s;ome of the mo&s;t delightful
Hours I ever pa&s;t, were in the Conver&s;ation of this female
Philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>My Father readily con&s;ented to accept of her as a Pupil; and
gave her a general Invitation to his Table, &s;o that &s;he and I were &s;eldom
a&s;under. My Parents were well plea&s;ed with our Intimacy, as her Piety was
not inferior to her Learning. Whe|ther it was owing to her own De&s;ire, or the
Envy of tho&s;e who &s;urvived her, I know not; but of her various and
beautiful Wri|tings, except one Poem of her's in Mrs. <HI>Barber</HI>'s Works,
I have never &s;een any publi&s;hed; 'tis true, as her Turn was chief|ly 
<PB N="29" REF="36"> to philo&s;ophical or divine Subjects, they might not be
agreeable to the pre&s;ent Ta&s;te; yet could her heavenly Mu&s;e de|&s;cend
from its &s;ublime Height to the ea&s;y epi&s;tolary Stile, and &s;uit it&s;elf
to my then gay Di&s;po&s;ition; as may appear by the two following Poems: To
make them intelli|gible, my Reader mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that I being in a Country
Town at the A&s;&s;izes Time, had writ her an Account to <HI>Dublin</HI> of the
principal Entertainments I met with there and in the re&s;t of the Country. I
mu&s;t al&s;o beg Pardon for publi&s;hing the Compliments paid to me in them,
which I really would omit were it po&s;&s;ible. Her An&s;wer to my fir&s;t
Letter was this.

<P><PB N="34" REF="41">As this Lady was perfectly well ac|quainted
with Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s Regard for me, he applied to her to intreat a
Meeting at her Lodgings, where I frequently went.</P>
<P>She had too much Compa&s;&s;ion for a de&s;|pairing honourable
Lover to refu&s;e his Re|que&s;t; and accordingly &s;he gave him No|tice the

In|terview was very melancholy, and his Sighs and Tears prevailed &s;o much on
my young &s;oft Heart, that, at la&s;t, I faithfully pro|mi&s;ed to be his; but
added, 
<Q REND="inline">'We were both &s;o young, that it would be prudent

<P>I forgot to mention, that I had &s;ent him his Watch and Ring
&s;ome Days before; he would fain have prevailed on me to take them again, but
I ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed them.</P>
<P>The next Morning, my Father told me, I mu&s;t prepare to go and
&s;tay a Year with my Grandfather, who lived a hundred Miles

re|turning in a few Moments, told me, Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> had &s;tabbed
him&s;elf with his Penknife: I ran all in Tears to my Mo|ther, entreating her
Permi&s;&s;ion to go and &s;ee him. She appeared much concerned, and &s;ent for
him to come to us, which plea&s;|ing Summons he readily obeyed. But I could
&s;carce forbear laughing at my own Credulity, when my wounded Swain came to us
in perfect Health. He had indeed given him&s;elf a Scratch, on Purpo&s;e to
ter|rify us, and had ju&s;t &s;uch a de&s;perate Wound as I have frequently
received from the Point of a Pin, without complaining.</P>
<P>However, by this Artifice he once more gained Admi&s;&s;ion to us,
and had an Op|portunity of a&s;&s;uring my Mother, 
<Q REND="inline">'That if &s;he &s;ent me to the

&s;ober Man, your Father's Intere&s;t may <PB N="37" REF="44"> &s;oon get him a
Living, and till then ye &s;hall both live with us.'</Q></P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e &s;trangely &s;urprized me, and left me
doubtful how to act; to take to my&s;elf the Reproach of Di&s;obedience, in the
Eyes of the World, appeared very &s;hocking to me; and tho' I was re&s;olved to
marry Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> &s;ome Time or o|ther, yet I was &s;tartled at the
Thought of doing it immediately, and told my Mo|ther my Objections: However
they ap|peared but trifling to her. The next Morning &s;he called me pretty
early to Breakfa&s;t, and, to my great Surprize, I found Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>
with my Father, his Harp&s;ichord placed in the Parlour, which, with a Cat and
an Owl, were all his world|ly Goods.</P>
<P>He told me with great Rapture, that he was going for a Ring and a
Licence to be married in the Evening. As for my Part, I thought he only
je&s;ted, till my Father confirmed it, by telling me I mu&s;t either re&s;olve
to marry immediately, or break off with Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> entirely,
leaving it to my Choice which to do. I was too <PB N="38" REF="45"> much
confounded to make any other Return than to give my Hand to Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> who ki&s;&s;ed it with great Extacy; and my unfortunate
Nuptials being thus concluded, we were married privately in the Evening by the
Vicar-General, having no other Wit|ne&s;&s;es but my Father and Mother, and his
Father, and we re&s;olved to keep it &s;ecret for a few Days to avoid the Hurry
and Expence of Matrimony. We went into the Country to my Uncle Brigadier
<HI>Meade</HI>'s Seat for a Fortnight; where my new e&s;|pou&s;ed Hu&s;band
&s;taying from me a whole Day, in Pur&s;uit of his Game (for he de|lighted in
Fowling) at his Return, I pre|&s;ented him with the following Lines, my fir&s;t
Attempt in Poetry that was not quite childi&s;h:

<P>This little poetical E&s;&s;ay met with more Applau&s;e than it
really merited, on Account of my Youth, and was extremely acceptable to Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> who, with the Raptures of an enamoured Bridegroom, read it
to every Per&s;on whom he thought po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Ta&s;te or Genius.</P>
<P>On our Return to Town, we received the Vi&s;its and Compliments of
all our Ac|quaintance; every one of whom my Mo|ther a&s;&s;ured, I had married
without their Con&s;ent; but this was not all, for &s;he &s;aid it &s;o often,
that at length &s;he per&s;uaded her|&s;elf it was &s;o; and made it a Pretence
for giving me all imaginable ill Treatment, both in publick and private, which,
having no Remedy, I was obliged to bear as pa|tiently as I could; for if I
quitted her Hou&s;e, I had no Place to go to, as Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s whole
Income would &s;carce have paid the Rent of a tolerable ready furni&s;hed
Lodging. However I had &s;ome Con&s;ola|tion in Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s
Tenderne&s;s, which <PB N="41" REF="48"> &s;eemed daily to increa&s;e for me,
and in the Conver&s;ation of a very agreeable Set of Friends, &s;ome of whom it
may not be a|mi&s;s to give a particular De&s;cription of.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, I had the Honour of being well received by
Mrs. <HI>Percival,</HI> who is married to the Brother of the Earl of
<HI>Egmont,</HI> to who&s;e Virtues I cannot refu&s;e doing Ju&s;tice, (altho'
her Cen&s;ures of me have not been over-charitable) a Lady of mo&s;t
univer&s;al Genius, there being no one Accompli&s;hment, that adorns the Woman
of Quality but what &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and her Sta|tion gave her an
Opportunity of &s;hewing them to Advantage; &s;he was al&s;o extreme|ly happy
in her Family; her Hu&s;band was a mo&s;t worthy Gentleman; both her Sons Men
of Sen&s;e and Honour, and one of her Daughters very agreeable. It may ea&s;ily
be &s;uppo&s;ed this Belle A&s;&s;embly engaged the Company of all the learned
and polite World; every Night was a Drawing-Room, and the ingenious and curious
of both Sexes went Home delighted and im|proved. As my Father was Phy&s;ician
to Mrs. <HI>Percival,</HI> and her elde&s;t Son married <PB N="42" REF="49"> to
a near Relation of mine, I had at all Times free Acce&s;s, and &s;o found a
frequent plea&s;ing Relief from my Vexations.</P>
<P>I had al&s;o the much envied Honour of being known to Dr.
<HI>Swift,</HI> who&s;e Ge|nius, excellent as it was, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed not his
Humanity in the mo&s;t judicious and u&s;eful Charities; altho' often hid under
a rough Appearance, till he was perfectly convinced both of the Hone&s;ty and
Di&s;tre&s;s of tho&s;e he be&s;towed it on: He was a perpetual Friend to Merit
and Learning; and utter|ly incapable of Envy. Indeed why &s;hould he not? who,
in true genuine Wit, could fear no Rival.</P>
<P>Yet as I have frequently ob&s;erved in Life, that where great
Talents are be&s;towed, there the &s;tronge&s;t Pa&s;&s;ions are likewi&s;e
given: This truly great Man did but too often let them have Dominion over him,
and that on the mo&s;t trifling Occa&s;ions. During Meal-times he was evermore
in a Storm; the Meat was always too much or too little done, or the Servants
had offended in &s;ome Point, imperceptible to the re&s;t of the Company;
however, when the Cloth <PB N="43" REF="50"> was taken away, he made his
Gue&s;ts rich Amends for the Pain he had given them by the former Part of his
Behaviour. For 
<Q> 
<L>Then was truly mingled in the friendly Bowl</L> 
<L>The Fea&s;t of Rea&s;on and the Flow of Soul.</L> 
<BIBL>Pope.</BIBL></Q> Yet &s;trict Temperance pre&s;erved; for
the Doctor never drank above half a Pint of Wine, in every Gla&s;s of which he
mixed Water and Sugar; yet, if he liked his Company, would &s;it many Hours
over it, unlocking all the Springs of Policy, Learn|ing, true Humour and
inimitable Wit.</P>
<P>It is a very great Lo&s;s to the World, that this admirable
Gentleman never could be prevailed on to give us the Particulars of his own
Life; becau&s;e, as it is the Fate of all eminent Per&s;ons to have various
Cha|racters given of them, &s;o it was more re|markably his: One Rea&s;on for
this may ju&s;tly be a&s;&s;igned; that as at his fir&s;t &s;etting out Party
ran high, tho&s;e who on either Side had any Talents for Writing, &s;pared not
to throw the blacke&s;t A&s;per&s;ions on the <PB N="44" REF="51"> other; &s;o
that, if we give them both Cre|dit, we mu&s;t conclude, there was neither
Honour nor Virtue among them; but that all who were out, <HI>Tories</HI> and
<HI>Whigs, Whigs</HI> and <HI>Tories,</HI> were equally corrupt: Indeed
Ambition is a grand Deceiver, and apt to undermine Integrity it&s;elf; and this
the Doctor him&s;elf was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of, that I have frequently heard him
declare, 
<Q REND="inline">'He thought it a great Ble&s;&s;ing that all his
Hopes of Preferment were at once cut off; in&s;omuch that he had nothing to
tempt or mi&s;lead him from a Patrioti&s;m, in which his grateful Country found
their Happine&s;s and Security.'</Q></P>
<P>This leads me to a Story, I remember to have heard him tell, and
therefore, I hope, cannot be impertinent:</P>
<P>A Clergyman, who&s;e Character greatly re&s;embled that I have
heard Bi&s;hop <HI>Berkley</HI> give to Bi&s;hop <HI>Atterbury</HI>; namely, a
mo&s;t learned fine Gentleman, who under the &s;oft|e&s;t and polite&s;t
Appearance concealed the mo&s;t turbulent Ambition: This Clergy|man having made
his Merit, as a Preacher, too eminent to be overlooked, had it early 
<PB N="45" REF="52"> rewarded with a Mitre; his Friend Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> went
to congratulate him on it; but at the &s;ame Time told him, 
<Q REND="inline">'He hoped, as his Lord&s;hip was a Native of
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and had now a Seat in the Hou&s;e of Peers, he would employ
his powerful Elocution in the Service of his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Country.'</Q> The
Prelate told him, 
<Q REND="inline">'The Bi&s;hoprick was but a very &s;mall one, and
he could not hope for a better, if he did not oblige the Court.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Very well, &s;ays <HI>Swift,</HI> then it is to
be hoped, when you have a better, you will become an hone&s;t Man.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, that I will, Mr. Dean, &s;ays he, till then,
my Lord, farewel.'</Q> This pious Prelate was twice tran&s;lated to richer
Sees; and, on every Tran&s;lation, Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> waited on him to remind
him of his Promi&s;e, but to no Purpo&s;e; there was now an Archbi&s;hoprick in
View, and till that was obtained, nothing could be done: This in a &s;hort Time
he likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; he then &s;ent for the Dean, and told him, 
<Q REND="inline">'I am now at the Top of my Pre|ferment, for I well
know no <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> will ever be made Primate, therefore as 
<PB N="46" REF="53"> I can ri&s;e no higher in Fortune or Sta|tion, I will
zealou&s;ly promote the good of my Country.'</Q> (A fine Rea&s;on truly!) And
&s;o he commenced a mo&s;t outrageous Patriot, from tho&s;e very laudable
Motives, and continued &s;o till his Death, which hap|pened within the&s;e few
Years.</P>
<P>I hope my Readers will indulge me in the frequent Mention I
&s;hall make of Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>; for tho' his Works are univer|&s;ally
e&s;teemed; yet few Per&s;ons now living, have had &s;o many Opportunities of
&s;eeing him in private Life; as my being a Per&s;on <HI>&s;ans</HI>
Con&s;equence afforded me, which Hap|pine&s;s I obtained by the following
Means:</P>
<P>The learned Nymph before-mentioned, whom Curio&s;ity engaged every
Per&s;on to &s;ee, had &s;hewn many of my Scribbles to Dr. <HI>Delany,</HI>
known &s;ufficiently by his own incomparable Life and Writings: As &s;he was
one of the fir&s;t to congratulate me on my Marriage; &s;he was a Witne&s;s how
&s;everely both Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> and I were u&s;ed, or rather abu&s;ed by
my Mother; &s;he told Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> of it, and made &s;uch fa|vourable
mention of the poor young Couple, <PB N="47" REF="54"> that he generou&s;ly
imagined his countenan|cing Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> might be a Means of
pro|curing us better Treatment. He had been Cla&s;s-fellow with my Father in
the Col|lege, and tho' they did not vi&s;it, yet they had that mutual E&s;teem
for each other, which good Men feel for good Men; and were plea&s;ed whenever
Accident threw them into each other's Company. The Doctor, preaching at our
Pari&s;h Church immedi|ately after our Marriage, was &s;o kind as to join us
coming out, and accompany us Home, to wi&s;h the young Couple Joy, a Favour we
were all extremely proud of; at parting he gave us all an Invitation to to dine
at his beautiful Villa, about a &s;mall Mile di&s;tant from <HI>Dublin</HI>;
what Opinion I conceived of him and his Improvements, may be &s;een in the
following Lines, com|po&s;ed in one of his lovely Arbours:&mdash; 
<Q>

</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Whether it was owing to my Youth, or any real Merit in the
Ver&s;es, I know not, but, weak as they were, from the Candour of the Company
they met with great Applau&s;e, and the worthy Gentleman to whom they were
directed, prai&s;ed the Poetry extremely, only mode&s;tly wi&s;hed I had a
better Sub|ject to employ my fine Genius, as he was plea&s;ed to call it.</P>
<P>I hope, if I &s;hould live to publi&s;h the&s;e Writings, none of
the honourable Per&s;ons mentioned in them, as having been once my Friends,
will be offended at it; &s;ince whate|ver Misfortunes have &s;ince befallen me,
I was not then quite unworthy of the Re|gard they &s;hewed me, and &s;till
retain a grateful Sen&s;e of their Favour; only la|menting that by one fatal
Folly it is irreco|verably lo&s;t.</P>
<P>And now I mu&s;t confe&s;s, as I have talked of Ambition, I had a
&s;trong one to be known to Dr. <HI>Swift:</HI> As Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> had
recommended and introduced Mr. <PB N="50" REF="57"> <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> to him,
and the learned Lady before-mentioned, I thought it a little hard to be
excluded from the Delight and In|&s;truction I might po&s;&s;ibly receive from
&s;uch Conver&s;ation; and having often re|mon&s;trated on this Head, to no
Purpo&s;e, I at la&s;t told them, (for to give me my due I was pretty pert) 
<Q REND="inline">'that truly they were envious, and would not let
me &s;ee the Dean, knowing how much I &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them all.'</Q> As I
&s;poke this but half &s;e|rious, I &s;et them all a laughing, and as they were
to meet the next Day at the Deanery-Hou&s;e to keep the Anniver&s;ary of his
Birth-day, I inclo&s;ed to Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> the following Lines: 
<Q> 
<LG>

<HI>Birth-day.</HI></HEAD>
<L>WHILE I the God-like Men of Old,</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> pre&s;ented the&s;e Lines to the Dean, and at
the &s;ame time told him my &s;aucy Speech above-mentioned. The Dean kindly
accepted of my Compliment, and &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'He would &s;ee me whenever I plea&s;|ed.'</Q> A
mo&s;t welcome Me&s;&s;age to me!</P>
<P>A few Days after, the Dean &s;ent the Doctor Word, he would dine
with him at <HI>Delville,</HI> and de&s;ired to meet Mr. and Mrs.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> there: You may be a&s;&s;ured I obeyed this welcome Summons,
and a Gen|tlewoman <PB N="52" REF="59"> was &s;o kind as to call on me to go
with her; when we arrived, Dr. <HI>De|lany</HI>'s Servant told us, his
Ma&s;ter, the Dean, and Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> were walking in the Garden; we
met them on a noble Terra&s;s, who&s;e Summit was crowned with a mag|nificent
Portico, where Painting and Sculp|ture di&s;played their utmo&s;t Charms: The
Lady pre&s;ented me to the Dean, who &s;a|luted me, and &s;urprized me, by
a&s;king her, 
<Q REND="inline">'If I was her Daughter?'</Q> She &s;miled and
&s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'I was Mrs. <HI>P&mdash;n.</HI>'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What, &s;ays he, this poor little Child married!
God help her, &s;he is early engaged in Trouble.'</Q> We pa&s;&s;ed the Day in
a mo&s;t elegant and delightful Manner; and the Dean, engag|ing Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> to preach for him at the Cathedral the <HI>Sunday</HI>
following, gave me al&s;o with the re&s;t of the Company an Invi|tation to
Dinner. As the Communion is admini&s;tered every <HI>Sunday</HI> in this
antique Church, dedicated to St. <HI>Patrick,</HI> the fir&s;t Prelate who
taught the Go&s;pel in <HI>Ireland,</HI> I was charmed to &s;ee with what a
becoming Piety the Dean performed that &s;olemn Ser|vice; which he had &s;o
much at Heart, that <PB N="53" REF="60"> he wanted not the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of
the Litur|gy, but went quite thro' it without ever looking in the Prayer-Book.
Indeed an|other Part of his Behaviour on this Occa|&s;ion was cen&s;ured by
&s;ome as &s;avouring of <HI>Popery,</HI> which was, that he bowed to the
Holy-Table; however this Circum&s;tance may vindicate him from the wicked
A&s;per|&s;ion of being deemed an Unbeliever, &s;ince 'tis plain he had the
utmo&s;t Reverence for the Euchari&s;t. Service being over, we met the Dean at
the Church-Door, &s;ur|rounded by a Crowd of Poor, to all of whom he gave
Charity, excepting one old Woman, who held out a very dirty Hand to him; he
told her very gravely, 
<Q REND="inline">'That though &s;he was a Beggar, Water was not
&s;o &s;carce but &s;he might have wa&s;hed her Hands:'</Q> And &s;o we marched
with the Silver Verge before us to the Deanery-Hou&s;e. When we came into the
Parlour, the Dean kindly &s;aluted me, and without allowing me Time to &s;it
down, bade me come and &s;ee his Study; Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> was for
following us, but the Dean told him merrily, He did not de&s;ire his Company; 
<PB N="54" REF="61"> and &s;o he ventured to tru&s;t me with him into the
Library: 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, &s;ays he, I have brought you here to
&s;hew you all the Mo|ney I got when I was in the Mini&s;try, but do not
&s;teal any of it.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I will not indeed, Sir, &s;ays I;'</Q> &s;o he
opened a Ca|binet, and &s;hewed me a whole Parcel of empty Drawers; 
<Q REND="inline">'Ble&s;s me, &s;ay he, the Money is flown;'</Q> he
then opened his Bureau, wherein he had a great Number of curious Trinkets of
various Kinds, &s;ome of which he told me, 
<Q REND="inline">'Were pre&s;ented to him by the Earl and
Counte&s;s of <HI>Oxford</HI>; &s;ome by Lady <HI>Ma&s;ham,</HI> and &s;ome by
La|dy <HI>Betty Germain</HI>;'</Q> at la&s;t, coming to a Drawer filled with
Medals, he bade me chu&s;e two for my&s;elf; but he could not help &s;miling,
when I began to poize them in my Hands, chu&s;ing them by Weight rather than
Antiquity, of which indeed I was not then a Judge.</P>
<P>The Dean amu&s;ed me in this Manner till we were &s;ummoned to
Dinner, where his Behaviour was &s;o humorous, that I cannot avoid relating
&s;ome Part of it: He placed him&s;elf at the Head of his Table oppo&s;ite 
<PB N="55" REF="62"> to a great Pier-Gla&s;s, under which was a Marble
Side-board, &s;o that he could &s;ee in the Gla&s;s whatever the Servants did
at it: He was &s;erved entirely in Plate, and with great Elegance; but the Beef
being over|roa&s;ted put us all in Confu&s;ion, the Dean called for the
Cook-maid, and ordered her to take it down Stairs, and do it le&s;s; the Maid
an&s;wered, very innocently, 
<Q REND="inline">'That &s;he could not:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, what Sort of a Crea|ture are you, &s;ays he,
to commit a Fault which cannot be amended?'</Q> And turning to me he &s;aid
very gravely, 
<Q REND="inline">'That he hoped, as the Cook was a Woman of Genius,
he &s;hould, by this Manner of ar|guing, be able in about a Year's Time to
convince her &s;he had better &s;end up the Meat too little than too much
done;'</Q> charging the Men Servants, 
<Q REND="inline">'Whenever they imagined the Meat was ready, they
&s;hould take it Spit and all, and bring it up by Force, promi&s;ing to aid
them, in ca&s;e the Cook re&s;i&s;ted.'</Q> The Dean then turning his Eye on
the Looking-gla&s;s e&s;|pied the Butler opening a Bottle of Ale, and helping
him&s;elf to the fir&s;t Gla&s;s; he <PB N="56" REF="63"> very kindly jumbled
the re&s;t together, that his Ma&s;ter and Gue&s;ts might all fare alike. 
<Q REND="inline">'Ha! Friend, &s;ays the Dean, Sharp's the Word, I
find you drank my Ale, for which I &s;top two Shillings of your Board-Wages
this Week, for I &s;corn to be out|done in any thing, even in cheating.'</Q>
Dinner at la&s;t was over to my great Joy; for now I had Hope of a more
agreeable Entertainment than what the &s;quabbling with the Servants had
afforded us.</P>
<P>The Dean thanked Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> for his Sermon: 
<Q REND="inline">'I never, &s;ays he, preached but twice in my
Life, and then they were not Sermons, but Pamphlets.'</Q> I a&s;ked him, 
<Q REND="inline">'What might be the Subject of them;'</Q> he told
me, 
<Q REND="inline">'They were again&s;t <HI>Wood</HI>'s
Half-pence.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pray, Madam, &s;ays he, do you &s;moke;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No indeed, Sir, &s;ays I;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nor your Hu&s;band;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Neither, Sir:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'It is a Sign, &s;aid he, you were neither of you
bred in the Univer|&s;ity of <HI>Oxford</HI>; for drinking and &s;moak|ing are
the fir&s;t Rudiments of Learning taught there; and in tho&s;e two Arts no
Univer&s;ity in <HI>Europe</HI> can out-do them.'</Q> <PB N="57" REF="64"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pray Mrs. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> tell me your
Faults;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir, I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed, for if
I can help it, you &s;hall never find them out;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No, &s;ays he, then Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>
&s;hall tell me;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I will, Sir, &s;ays he, when I have di&s;covered
them.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pray Mr. Dean, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Delany,</HI> why
will you be &s;o unpolite, as to &s;uppo&s;e Mrs. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> has any
Faults?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, I will tell you, replied the Dean; whenever
I &s;ee a Number of agreeable Qualities in any Per&s;on, I am always &s;ure,
they have bad ones &s;ufficient to poize the Scale.'</Q> I bowed, and told the
Dean, 
<Q REND="inline">'He did me great Honour:'</Q> And in this I copied
Bi|&s;hop <HI>Berkley,</HI> whom I have frequently heard declare, 
<Q REND="inline">'That when any Speech was made to him, which might
be con&s;trued either into a Compliment, or an Affront, or (that to make u&s;e
of his own Word) had two Handles; he was &s;o meek and &s;o mild, that he
always took hold of the be&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>The Dean then a&s;ked me, 
<Q REND="inline">'If I was a Queen, what I &s;hould chu&s;e to have
after Dinner?'</Q> I an&s;wered, 
<Q REND="inline">'His Conver&s;a|tion;'</Q> <PB N="58" REF="65"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Phooh! &s;ays he, I mean what Regale?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'A Di&s;h of Coffee, Sir;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why then I will &s;o far make you as hap|py as a
Queen, you &s;hall have &s;ome in Perfection; for when I was Chaplain to the
Earl of <HI>Berkley,</HI> who was in the Go|vernment here, I was &s;o poor, I
was ob|liged to keep a Coffee-hou&s;e, and all the Nobility re&s;orted to it to
talk Trea&s;on:'</Q> I could not help &s;miling at this Oddity, but I really
had &s;uch an Awe on me, that I could not venture to a&s;k him, as I longed to
do, what it meant? The Bottle and Gla&s;&s;es being taken away, the Dean &s;et
a|bout making the Coffee; but the Fire &s;corching his Hand, he called to me to
reach him his Glove, and changing the Coffee-pot to his Left-hand, held out his
Right one, ordered me to put the Glove on it, which accordingly I did; when
taking up Part of his Gown to fan him&s;elf with, and acting in Character of a
prudi&s;h Lady, he &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, I do not know what to think; Women may be
hone&s;t that do &s;uch Things, but, for my Part, I never could bear to touch
any Man's Fle&s;h&mdash;<PB N="59" REF="66"> except my Hu&s;band's, whom
perhaps, &s;ays he, &s;he wi&s;hed at the Devil.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> &s;ays he, you would not
tell me your Wife's Faults; but I have found her out to be a d&mdash;ned,
in&s;olent, proud, unmannerly Slut:'</Q> I looked con|founded, not knowing what
Offence I had committed.&mdash;Says Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, Sir, I mu&s;t confe&s;s &s;he is a little
&s;aucy to me &s;ometimes, but&mdash;what has &s;he done now?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Done! why nothing, but &s;at there quietly, and
never once offered to interrupt me in making the Coffee, whereas had I had a
Lady of modern good Breeding here, &s;he would have &s;truggled with me for the
Coffee-pot till &s;he had made me &s;cald my&s;elf and her, and made me throw
the Coffee in the Fire; or per|haps at her Head, rather than permit me to take
&s;o much trouble for her.'</Q></P>
<P>This rai&s;ed my Spirits and as I found the Dean always prefaced a
Compliment with an Affront, I never afterwards was &s;tartled at the latter,
(as too many have been, not entering into his peculiarly ironical Strain) but
was mode&s;tly contented with <PB N="60" REF="67"> the former, which was more
than I de&s;erv|ed, and which the Surprize rendered doubly plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>By this Time, the Bell rang for Church; and Dr. <HI>Delany</HI>
and Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> who with my&s;elf were now all the Company, (for
the re&s;t departed before the Coffee was out) were obliged to attend the
Summons: But as there is no Service in the Cathedral, but Evening-Prayer at Six
o'Clock, I cho&s;e rather to attend the Dean there, than go to hear another
Sermon; by this means I had him all to my&s;elf for near three Hours, during
which Time he made me read to him the Annals of the four la&s;t Years of the
Reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> written by him|&s;elf; the Intentions of which
&s;eemed to be a Vindication of the then Mini&s;try and him|&s;elf, from having
any De&s;ign of placing the Pretender on the Throne of <HI>Great-Britain:</HI>
It began with a &s;olemn Adjuration, that all the Facts therein contained were
Truth, and then proceeded in the Manner of Lord <HI>Clarendon,</HI> with giving
the particular Cha|racters of every Per&s;on whom he &s;hould have occa&s;ion
to mention; among&s;t whom, <PB N="61" REF="68"> I remember, he compared Lord
<HI>Bolling|broke</HI> to <HI>Petronius,</HI> one who agreeably mingled
Bu&s;ine&s;s with Plea&s;ure. At the Conclu&s;ion of every Period, he demanded
of me, 
<Q REND="inline">'Whether I under&s;tood it? For I would, &s;ays
he, have it intelligent to the meane&s;t Capacity, and if you compre|prehend
it, 'tis po&s;&s;ible every Body may.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I bowed, and a&s;&s;ured him I did.'</Q> And
indeed it was written with &s;uch Per&s;pecuity and Elegance of Stile, that I
mu&s;t have had no Capacity at all, if I did not ta&s;te what was &s;o
exqui&s;itely beautiful.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> when he was Chaplain to Alderman
<HI>Barber,</HI> in the Year of his Mayoralty, mentioned tho&s;e Annals to Mr.
<HI>Pope,</HI> who &s;aid he had di&s;&s;uaded the Dean from publi&s;hing them;
as the Facts contained in them were notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e. I was greatly
a&s;toni&s;hed when Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> told me this, nor could I tell what
to deter|mine: It &s;eemed &s;trange to me, that a Per&s;on of the Dean's good
Sen&s;e and Ve|racity, &s;hould in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner invocate the
Almighty to bear Te&s;timony to Fal&s;hoods, publicly known to be &s;uch. 
<PB N="62" REF="69"> And yet as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was in Pro&s;e a Man of
unque&s;tioned Probity, and united to the Dean in the &s;tricte&s;t Bonds of
Friend&s;hip, and con&s;equently, without doubt, well ac|quainted with the
Tran&s;actions of tho&s;e Times, we can hardly &s;uppo&s;e he would &s;peak in
the manner he did, without ju&s;t Grounds for &s;o doing; and his Evidence
&s;eems &s;trengthened by his being of the <HI>Ro|mi&s;h</HI> Religion, which
mu&s;t certainly incline him to wi&s;h well to a Prince of the &s;ame Faith.
However, upon the whole, I am inclined to judge charitably of the Dean; and to
believe, that tho' the Mini&s;ters fre|quently employed him as a Writer, and
en|tertained him as a Companion; yet they had not let him into the Depth of
their De|&s;igns, <HI>the My&s;tery of Iniquity!</HI> So that what he relates
in his Annals of the invio|lable Attachment of tho&s;e in Power to the
<HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion and the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Faith, might be
by him believed to be Truth: For who &s;o wi&s;e but may be de|ceived? And
perhaps Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s long and intimate Corre&s;pondence with Lord
<HI>Bolling|broke</HI> gave him a better Knowledge of <PB N="63" REF="70"> what
was really intended at that critical Juncture. Pardon this Digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Bell rang for Evening-Prayer, to which I accompanied the Dean.
There is a fine Organ in this Church, which, with its antique Magnificence and
&s;o harmonious a Choir, brought <HI>Milton</HI>'s Lines into my Mind: 
<Q> 
<L>And let my due Feet never fail</L> 
<L>To walk the &s;tudious Cloy&s;ters pale,</L> 
<L>And love the high embowed Roof,</L> 
<L>With antique Pillars, ma&s;&s;y Proof,</L> 
<L>And &s;tory'd Windows richly dight,</L> 
<L>Shedding a dim religious Light;</L> 
<L>There let the pealing Organ blow</L> 
<L>To the full-voic'd Choir below;</L> 
<L>In Service high! and Anthem clear,</L> 
<L>Which may with Plea&s;ure thro' mine Ear,</L> 
<L>Di&s;&s;olve me into Exta&s;ies,</L> 
<L>And bring all Heaven before my Eyes.</L></Q></P>
<P>On our Return to the Deanery-hou&s;e, we found there waiting our
coming Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> and Mr. <HI>Rochford,</HI> to who&s;e Wife, <HI>A
Letter of Advice to a new-married Lady,</HI> <PB N="64" REF="71"> (publi&s;hed
&s;ince in the Dean's Works) was written, and which by the bye, the Lady did
not take as a Compliment, either to her or the Sex, Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Sheridan,</HI> Author of the Art of Punning, with two or three other
Clergymen, (who u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening with the Dean) Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> and I were for going Home, but the Dean told us, 
<Q REND="inline">'He gave us leave to &s;tay to Supper;'</Q> which
from him was a &s;ufficient Invitation. The Dean then pulled out of his Pocket,
a little Gold Runlet, in which was a Bottle-Screw, and opening a Bottle of
Wine, he decanted it off; the la&s;t Gla&s;s being muddy, he called to Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> to drink it: 
<Q REND="inline">'For, &s;ays he, I always keep &s;ome poor
Par&s;on to drink the foul Wine for me:'</Q> Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> entering
into his Humour, thank|ed him, and told him, 
<Q REND="inline">'He did not know the Difference, but was glad to
get a Gla&s;s at any rate:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why then, &s;ays the Dean, you &s;han't, for I'll
drink it my|&s;elf: Why, P&mdash;x take you, you are wi&s;er than a paultry
Curate, whom I a&s;ked to dine with me a few Days ago; <PB N="65" REF="72"> for
upon my making the &s;ame Speech to him, he told me he did not under&s;tand
&s;uch U&s;age, and &s;o walked off without his Dinner. By the &s;ame Token, I
told the Gentleman who recommended him to me, That the Fellow was a Blockhead,
and I had done with him.'</Q></P>
<P>The Dean then mi&s;&s;ing his Golden Bottle-Screw, told me, very
&s;ternly, 
<Q REND="inline">'He was &s;ure I had &s;tolen it:'</Q> I affirmed,
very &s;eriou&s;|ly, 
<Q REND="inline">'I had not:'</Q> Upon which he looked for it, and
found it where he him&s;elf had laid it; 
<Q REND="inline">''Tis well for you, &s;ays he, that I have got it,
or I would have charged you with Theft:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, pray, Sir, &s;hould I be &s;u&s;pected more
than any other Per|&s;on in the Company?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'For a very good Rea&s;on, &s;ays he, becau&s;e
you are the poore&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>There now came in, to &s;up with the Dean, one of the odde&s;t
little Mortals I ever met with: He formerly wrote the <HI>Gazetteer</HI>; and
upon the Strength of be|ing an Author, and of having travelled, took upon him
not only to dictate to the Company, but to contradict whatever any 
<PB N="66" REF="73"> other Per&s;on advanced Right or Wrong, till he had
entirely &s;ilenced them all: And then having the whole Talk to him&s;elf,
(for, to my great Surprize, the Dean neither interrupted nor &s;hewed any
Di&s;like of him) he told us a whole String of Improbabi|lities, &s;uch as, 
<Q REND="inline">'That each Pillar of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at
<HI>Rome</HI> took up more Ground than a Convent which was near it, where|in
were twelve Monks, with their Cha|pel, Garden, and Infirmary.'</Q> By this
Account, every Pillar mu&s;t take up, at lea&s;t, half an Acre, and,
con&s;idering the Number of them, we mu&s;t conclude the Edifice to be &s;ome
Miles in Circumference. No one pre&s;ent had ever been at <HI>Rome,</HI> except
him&s;elf, &s;o that he might tell us ju&s;t what he thought proper.</P>
<P>I took notice, that before this dogma|tical Gentleman the Dean was
mo&s;t re|markably complai&s;ant to Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> and me, and at our
going away, the Dean would hand me down all the Steps to the Coach, thanking us
for the Honour of our Company, at the &s;ame time &s;liding into my Hand as
much Money as Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> <PB N="67" REF="74"> and I had given at
the Offering in the Morning, and Coach-hire al&s;o, which I dur&s;t not
refu&s;e, le&s;t I &s;hould have been deemed as great a Blockhead as the
Par&s;on, who refu&s;ed the thick Wine.</P>
<P>It has been a Matter of Di&s;pute among&s;t the Learned, whether
<HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland</HI> had the Honour of giving to the World this
admirable Per&s;on; 'tis probable Po&s;terity may contend this Point, as warmly
as the &s;even Cities of <HI>Greece</HI> did the Birth-place of <HI>Homer:</HI>
And tho' in reality, 'tis of no great Importance where a Man is born; yet as
the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> are the eternal Ridicule of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for
their Ignorance, I am proud <HI>Hibernia</HI> had the Happine&s;s of producing
this brilliant Wit, to redeem the Credit of the Country; and to convince the
World, a Man may draw his fir&s;t Breath there, and yet be learned, wi&s;e,
generous, religi|ous, witty, &s;ocial and polite.</P>
<P>The Account I have frequently heard the Dean give of him&s;elf,
was, that he was born in <HI>Hoey's-Alley,</HI> in <HI>Warburgh</HI>'s
Pari&s;h, <HI>Dublin</HI>; his Father was a Lawyer, and re|turning from the
Circuit, he unfortunately <PB N="68" REF="75"> brought home the Itch with him,
which he had got by lying in &s;ome foul Bed on the Road. Somebody advi&s;ed
him to u&s;e Mercury to cure it, which Pre&s;cription co&s;t him his Life in a
very few Days after his Return. The Dean was a po&s;thumous Son to this
Gentleman, but, as he &s;aid, came Time enough to &s;ave his Mother's Credit.
He was given to an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Woman to nur&s;e, who&s;e Hu&s;band being
in <HI>England,</HI> and writing to her to come to him; as &s;he could not bear
the Thoughts of parting with the Child, &s;he very fairly took him with her,
unknown to his Mother, or any of his Relations, who could learn no Tid|ings
either of him or her for three Years; at the End of which Time, &s;he returned
to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and re&s;tored the Child to his Mo|ther, from whom &s;he
ea&s;ily obtained a Par|don, both on account of the Joy &s;he con|ceived at
&s;eeing her only Son again, when &s;he had in a manner lo&s;t all Hope of it;
as al&s;o, that it was plain, the Nur&s;e had no other Motive for &s;tealing
him, but pure Affection, which the Women of <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">land</HI> generally have in as eminent Degree, for 
<PB N="69" REF="76"> the Children they nur&s;e, as for their own Offspring.</P>
<P>I believe the Dean's early Youth did not promi&s;e that bright Day
of Wit which has &s;ince enlightened the learned World. Whil&s;t he was at the
Univer&s;ity of <HI>Dublin,</HI> he was &s;o far from being di&s;tingui&s;hed
for any Superiority of Parts or Learning, that he was &s;topped of his Degree
as a Dunce. When I heard the Dean relate this Circum|&s;tance, for I &s;et down
nothing but what I had from his own Mouth, I told him, I &s;uppo&s;ed he had
been idle; but he affirmed to the contrary; a&s;&s;uring me, he was real|ly
dull, which, if true, is very &s;urpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>I have often been led to look on the World as a Garden, and the
human Minds as &s;o many Plants, &s;et by the Hand of the great Creator for
Utility and Ornament. Thus, &s;ome we &s;ee, early produce beauti|ful
Blo&s;&s;oms, and as &s;oon fade away; others, who&s;e Gems are more &s;low in
un|folding, but more permanent, when blown; and others again, who tho' longer
in arriving at Perfection, not only ble&s;s us then with Shade and Odour, but
al&s;o with <PB N="70" REF="77"> delicious whole&s;ome Fruit. To go on with the
Allegory, we often hear from Chil|dren very bright Sallies of Wit, and
Re|flections above their Years: From the&s;e hopeful Beginnings we are apt to
expect &s;omething very extraordinary in their Ma|turity, but how often are we
di&s;appointed? How often do we &s;ee the&s;e &s;parkling Chil|dren dwindle
gradually into the mo&s;t hum|drum Men and Women, as if, to make u&s;e of the
Flori&s;ts Phra&s;e, the <HI>Blow</HI> was quite over; and &s;ome, who&s;e
Childhood has given no Pre&s;ages of great Talents, have improved every Year,
till they have brought forth the beautiful Flowers of Poetry and Rhetorick, and
the rich Fruits of Wi&s;dom and Virtue.</P>
<P>Whether this Compari&s;on will hold, I &s;ubmit to the Judgment of
tho&s;e who are better acquainted with the &s;ecret Workings of Nature, than I
can pre&s;ume to be. I am afraid of going out of my Depth, and yet I have a
great Inclination to &s;ay a little more on this Subject.</P>
<P>I have known a Per&s;on, who in his Youth was an extraordinary
Adept in Mu&s;ic, and <PB N="71" REF="78"> performed on &s;everal In&s;truments
extreme|ly well. I &s;aw the &s;ame Per&s;on &s;ome Years after; and lo! his
mu&s;ical Talent was entire|ly lo&s;t, and he was then a very good Painter. Now
I could not help forming a Notion in my own Mind, that as our Ideas depend on
the Fibres of the Brain, it was po&s;&s;ible we might by the continual U&s;e of
&s;ome particular one, weaken it &s;o as to make it peri&s;h; and at the &s;ame
time, another might exert from that very Cau&s;e it&s;elf with dou|ble
Strength. Thus, I &s;uppo&s;e, when this Gentleman's mu&s;ical Fibres
peri&s;hed, his painting ones &s;hot forth with Vigour. If there be any Truth
in this Whim of mine, which, I own, I am fond of believing my|&s;elf, we may
ea&s;ily account for the various Di&s;po&s;itions which we meet with, even in
the &s;ame Per&s;on at different Periods of Life.</P>
<P>But to return. Altho' it is not in my Power to give a &s;uccinct
Account of the Dean's Life, neither have I any intention to attempt it, yet I
believe I am better qualified to do it, than mo&s;t of tho&s;e who have
undertaken it, as they were ab&s;olute <PB N="72" REF="79"> Strangers to him,
and relate Things upon Hear&s;ay. The Dean, for the latter Part of his Life,
contracting his Acquaintance into a very narrow Compa&s;s, for as he was
fre|quently deaf, he thought this Infirmity made him trouble&s;ome, and
therefore kept no Company but &s;uch as he could be &s;o free with, as to bid
them &s;peak loud, or repeat what they had &s;aid; it was owing to this, that
Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> and I frequently pa&s;&s;ed whole Days with him, while
Numbers of our betters were excluded; and as he was like another
<HI>Ne&s;tor,</HI> full of Days and Wi&s;|dom, &s;o like him, he was pretty
much upon the Narrative, than which nothing could be more delightful to me, as
Plea&s;ure and In&s;truction flowed from his Lips: 
<Q>His Words 
<L>Drew Audience, and Attention &s;till as Night</L> 
<L>Or Summer's Noontide Air.</L><BIBL>MIL.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I remember in one of the&s;e periodica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Fits of Deafne&s;s, for they returned
on cer+tain Sea&s;ons on him, he &s;ent for me earl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the Morning; he told me when I came 
<PB N="73" REF="80"> he had found Employment for me; &s;o he brought to me out
of his Study a large Book, very finely bound in <HI>Turkey</HI> Lea|ther, and
hand&s;omely gilt; this, &s;ays he, is a Tran&s;lation of the Epi&s;tles of
<HI>Horace,</HI> a Pre&s;ent to me from the Author, it is a &s;pe|cial good
Cover! But I have a Mind there &s;hould be &s;omething valuable within &s;ide
of it; &s;o taking out his Penknife, he cut out all the Leaves clo&s;e to the
inner Mar|gin. Now, &s;ays he, I will give the&s;e what they greatly want, and
put them all into the Fire. He then brought out two Draw|ers filled with
Letters: Your Ta&s;k, Ma|dam, is to pa&s;te in the&s;e Letters, in this Cover,
in the Order I &s;hall give them to you; I intended to do it my&s;elf, but that
I thought it might be a pretty Amu&s;ement for a Child, &s;o I &s;ent for you.
I told him, I was extremely proud to be honoured with his Commands: But, Sir,
may I pre&s;ume to make a Reque&s;t to you, yes, &s;ays he, but ten to one I
&s;hall deny it. I hope not, Sir, it is this; may I have leave to read the
Letters as I go on? Why, provided you will acknowledge your&s;elf amply
re|warded <PB N="74" REF="81"> for your Trouble, I do not much care if I
indulge you &s;o far; but are you &s;ure you can read? I do not know, Sir, I
will try. Well then begin with this: It was a Letter from Lord
<HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> dated &s;ix o'Clock in the Morning; it began with a
Remark, how differently that Hour ap|peared to him now ri&s;ing cool, &s;erene,
and temperate, to contemplate the Beauties of Nature, to what it had done in
&s;ome for|mer Parts of his Life, when he was either in the mid&s;t of
Exce&s;&s;es, or returning Home &s;ated with them; &s;o he proceeded to
de&s;cribe the numberle&s;s Advantages with which Temperance and Virtue ble&s;s
their Votaries, and the Mi&s;eries which attend a contrary Cour&s;e. The
Epi&s;tle was pretty long, and the mo&s;t refined Piece of moral Philo&s;ophy I
ever met with, as indeed eve|ry one of his were, and I had the un&s;peak|able
Delight of reading &s;everal of them.</P>
<P>Nor can I be at all &s;urprized, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;hould
&s;o often celebrate a Genius, who, for Sublimity of Thought, and Ele|gance of
Stile, had few Equals. The re&s;t of the Dean's Corre&s;pondents were, the 
<PB N="75" REF="82"> Lady <HI>Ma&s;ham,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> Dr.

<HI>Pultney,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gay,</HI> Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot</HI>;
a noble and a learn|ed Set! So my Readers may judge what a Banquet I had. I
could not avoid remark|ing to the Dean, that notwith&s;tanding the Friend&s;hip
Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> profe&s;&s;ed for Mr. <HI>Gay,</HI> he could not forbear a
great many &s;atirical, or, if I may be allowed to &s;ay &s;o, envious Remarks
on the Succe&s;s of the <HI>Beggar's Opera.</HI> The Dean very frankly owned,
he did not think Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was &s;o candid to the Merits of other
Writers, as he ought to be. I then ventured to a&s;k the Dean, whe|ther he
thought the Lines Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> ad|dre&s;&s;es him with, in the Beginning
of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> were any Compliment to him? <HI>viz.</HI> 
<Q>

filled with low and ungentleman-like Reflections both on Mr. <HI>Gay</HI> and

<Q REND="inline">'Well, Madam, &s;aid the Dean, what do you think

a Mo|narch could in his Dominions.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But, Sir, &s;aid I, here is a <HI>Latin</HI>

<Q REND="inline">'No, replied he, &s;miling,&mdash;I will leave

<Q REND="inline">'Why a Garden&mdash;I cheated one of my Neighbours

&s;quare, and inclo&s;ed with a Stone Wall, the Dean a&s;ked me how I liked it?

<Q REND="inline">'Why pray, &s;aid I, where is the Garden?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Look behind you,'</Q> &s;aid he; I did &s;o, and
ob&s;erved the South Wall was lined with Brick, and a great Num|ber of Fruit

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh! replied he, you are in a poetical Vein; I
thought you had been taking Notice of my Wall, it is the be&s;t in
<HI>Ire|land</HI>; when the Ma&s;ons were building it, (as mo&s;t Trade&s;men
are Rogues) I watched them very clo&s;e, and as often as they could, they put
in a rotten Stone, of which however, I took no Notice, till they had built
three or four Perches be|yond it; now as I am an ab&s;olute Monarch in the
<HI>Liberties</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Liberties</HI> belonging to the
Dean.</NOTE>, and King of the Mob, my Way with them, was to have the Wall
thrown down to the Place where I ob&s;erved the rotten Stone, and by doing &s;o
five or &s;ix Times, the Workmen were at la&s;t convinced it was their
Intere&s;t to be hone&s;t;'</Q> or el&s;e, Sir, &s;aid I, your Wall 
<Q REND="inline">'would have been as tedious a Piece of 
<PB N="79" REF="86"> Work as <HI>Penelope</HI>'s Web, if all that was done in
the Day was to be undone at Night:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, an&s;wered he, I find you have Poetry for
every Occa&s;ion; but as you cannot keep Pace with me in walk|ing; (for indeed
I was not quite &s;o light then, as I had been &s;ome Months before) I would
have you &s;it down on that little Bank, till you are re&s;ted or I tired, to
put us more upon a Par.'</Q></P>
<P>I &s;eated my&s;elf, and away the Dean walk|ed, or rather trolled,
as hard as ever he could drive. I could not help &s;miling at his odd Gait, for
I thought to my&s;elf, he had written to &s;o much in Prai&s;e of Hor&s;es,
that he was re&s;olved to imitate them as nearly as he could: As I was
indulging this Fancy, the Dean returned to me, and gave me a &s;trong
Confirmation of his Par|tiality to tho&s;e Animals; 
<Q REND="inline">'I have been con&s;idering, Madam, as I walked,
&s;aid he, what a Fool Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> was to marry you, for he could
have afforded to keep a Hor&s;e for le&s;s Money than you co&s;t him, and that,
you mu&s;t confe&s;s, would have given him better Exerci&s;e and 
<PB N="80" REF="87"> more Plea&s;ure than a Wife:&mdash;Why you laugh, and do
not an&s;wer me&mdash;is not it Truth?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I mu&s;t an&s;wer you, Sir, with another
Que&s;tion; Pray how can a Batchelor judge of this Matter?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I find, &s;aid he, you are vain enough to give
your&s;elf the Preference:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I do, Sir, to that Species here, a
<HI>Huyoniam,</HI> I would, as becomes me, give Place to: But, Sir, it is going
to rain;'&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I hope not, &s;aid he, for that will co&s;t me
Six-pence for a Coach for you, (this Garden being at &s;ome Di&s;tance from his
Hou&s;e) come, ha&s;te: O how the Te&s;ter trembles in my Pocket!'</Q> I
obeyed, and we got in a Doors ju&s;t Time enough to e&s;cape a heavy Shower. 
<Q REND="inline">'Thank God, &s;aid the Dean, I have &s;aved my
Money; here, you Fel|low, (to his Servant) carry this Six-pence to the lame old
Man that &s;ells Ginger|bread at the Corner, becau&s;e he tries to do
&s;omething, and does not beg.'</Q></P>
<P>The Dean &s;hewed me into a little Street-Parlour, (where &s;at
his Hou&s;ekeeper, a matron-like Gentlewoman at Work) 
<Q REND="inline">'Here, &s;ays he, Mrs. <HI>Brent,</HI> take Care
of this <PB N="81" REF="88"> Child, meaning me) and &s;ee &s;he does no
Mi&s;chief, while I take my Walk out within Doors:'</Q> The Deanery-Hou&s;e has
I know not how many Pair of Back-Stairs in it; the preceding Dean who built it
being, it &s;eems, extremely fearful of Fire, was re&s;olved there &s;hould be
many Ways to e&s;cape in ca&s;e of Danger.</P>
<P>The Dean then ran up the Great-Stairs, down one Pair of
Back-Stairs, up another, in &s;o violent a Manner, that I could not help
expre&s;&s;ing my Unea&s;ine&s;s to the good Gentlewoman, le&s;t he &s;hould
fall, and be hurted; &s;he &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'It was a cu&s;tomary Ex|erci&s;e with him, when
the Weather did not permit him to walk abroad.'</Q></P>
<P>I told Mrs. <HI>Brent,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">'I believed the Dean was extremely
charitable;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Ma|dam, replied &s;he, No body can be
more &s;o; his Income is not above &s;ix hundred Pounds a Year, and every Year
he gives above the Half of it in private Pen&s;ions to decayed Families;
be&s;ides this, he keeps five hundred Pounds in the con&s;tant Ser|vice of the
indu&s;trious Poor: This he lends out in five Pounds at a Time, and 
<PB N="82" REF="89"> takes the Payment back at twelve Pence a Week; this does
them more Service, than if he gave it to them entirely, as it obliges them to
work, and at the &s;ame Time keeps up this charitable Fund for the
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of many. You cannot i|magine what Numbers of poor Trade&s;men,
who have even wanted proper Tools to carry on their Work, have by this &s;mall
Loan, been put into a pro&s;perous Way, and brought up their Families in
Credit. The Dean, added &s;he, has found out a new Method of being charitable,
in which however, I believe, he will have but few Followers; which is, to debar
him&s;elf of what he calls the Superfluities of Life, in order to admini&s;ter
to the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; you ju&s;t now &s;aw an
In|&s;tance of it, the Money a Coach would have co&s;t him, he gave to a poor
Man, unable to walk; when he dines alone, he drinks a Pint of Beer, and gives
away the Price of a Pint of Wine; and thus he acts in numberle&s;s
In&s;tances.'</Q></P>
<P>My Reader will, I hope, do me the Ju&s;|tice to believe I was
quite charmed with this <PB N="83" REF="90"> Account of the Dean's beneficent
Spirit; and I no longer wondered &s;o many of the Clergy endeavoured to
depreciate him; for, as it is well known, there are not, in the general, a more
voluptuous Set of Men living, this Doctrine of <HI>Self-denial.</HI> was enough
to make them pour out all their Anathema's on him, and brand him with the Name
of <HI>Athei&s;t,</HI> Unbeliever, and &s;uch like Terms, as they in their
Chri&s;tian Zeal thought proper to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>I before admired the Dean as a Per&s;on of di&s;tingui&s;hed
Genius, but now I learned to revere him as the Angel of <HI>Ireland.</HI> The
Dean running into the Parlour, threw a whole Packet of Manu&s;cript Poems into
my Lap, and &s;o he did for five or &s;ix Times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, till I had
an Apron full of Wit and Novelty, (for they were all of his own Writing,) and
&s;uch as had not then been made public, and many of them, I believe, never
will. Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> coming, according to the Dean's De&s;ire, to
Dinner, found me deeply engaged, and &s;at down to partake of my Entertainment,
till we were &s;ummoned to Table, to a le&s;s <PB N="84" REF="91"> noble Part. 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> &s;aid the Dean, I
hope you are jealous; I have had your Wife a good many Hours, and as &s;he is a
likely Girl, and I a very young Man, (<HI>Note,</HI> he was upwards of
Three&s;core) you do not know what may have happened: Tho' I mu&s;t tell you,
you are very partial to her; for here I have not been acquainted with her above
&s;ix Months, and I have al|ready di&s;covered two intolerable Faults in her;
'tis true, I looked &s;harp, or per|haps they might have e&s;caped my No|tice:
Nay, Madam, do not look &s;ur|pri&s;ed, I am re&s;olved to tell your
Hu&s;|band, that he may break you of them.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir, returned I, my Surprize is, that you
have not found out two and fifty in half that time; but let me know them, and I
will mend of them, if I can.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well put in, &s;ays he, for I be|lieve you can't;
but eat your Dinner, however, for they are not capital.'</Q> I obeyed, yet was
very impatient to know my particular Errors; he told me, 
<Q REND="inline">'I &s;hould hear of them Time enough.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="92">The Things being taken away; 
<Q REND="inline">'Now, good Sir, &s;aid I, tell me what I do
ami&s;s, that I may reform;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No, returned he; but I'll tell your Hu&s;band
before your Face to &s;hame you the more:&mdash;In the fir&s;t Place, Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> &s;he had the in|&s;olence this Morning, not only to
de&s;ire to read the Writings of the mo&s;t cele|brated Genius's of the Age, in
which I indulged her; but &s;he mu&s;t al&s;o, for|&s;ooth, pretend to prai&s;e
or cen&s;ure them,' as if &s;he knew &s;omething of the Matter; indeed her
Remarks were not much a|mi&s;s, con&s;idering they were Gue&s;s-Work; but this
Letter here of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s &s;he has ab&s;olutely condemned; read it,
(he did &s;o;) take notice of it, &s;aid the Dean; &s;he would al&s;o have had
me explain that <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence to her, but I had &s;ome Mode&s;ty,
tho' &s;he had none you &s;ee.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, Sir, &s;aid I, &s;ure Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>
would not (e&s;pecially to you) write any thing which even a Virgin might not
read.'</Q> Now, Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">'&s;aid the Dean, is her Curio&s;ity at work; I'll
be hang'd if &s;he lets you &s;leep to|night till you have &s;atisfied it. But
this <PB N="86" REF="93"> is not all; &s;he had the Vanity to affirm, that
&s;he thought her&s;elf preferable to a Hor&s;e, and more capable of giving you
plea&s;ure: Nay, &s;he laugh'd in my Face for being of a different Opinion; and
a&s;ked me how a Batchelor &s;hould know any thing of the Matter? If you don't
take down her Pride, there will be no bearing her.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> 'tis
your Fault that &s;he is &s;o conceited; &s;he was always di&s;po&s;ed to be
&s;aucy, but &s;ince you have done her the honour to take notice of her, and
make her your Companion, there is no &s;uch thing as mortifying her.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Very fine, &s;aid the Dean, I have got much by
complaining to you, to have all your Wife's Faults laid at my Door.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, Sir, &s;aid I; all the&s;e Mi&s;demeanors
may be included under the Article of <HI>Pride:</HI> Now, let me know my other
Crime:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, &s;aid he, you can't walk fa&s;t; but at
pre|&s;ent, I excu&s;e you.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, Sir, if I can't mend my Pride, I'll try to
mend my Pace.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> &s;aid he, I 
<PB N="87" REF="94"> 'have a mind to clip your Wife's Wit.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir, &s;aid I, that's Death by Law, for
'tis Sterling.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Shut up your Mouth, for all Day, <HI>Letty,</HI>
&s;aid Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> for that An&s;wer is real Wit.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">Nay, '&s;aid the Dean, I believe we had better
&s;hut up our own, for at this rate &s;he'll be too many for us.'</Q> I am
&s;ure, if I was not proud before, this was enough to make me &s;o.</P>
<P>The Dean gue&s;&s;ed right, when he &s;aid, I would not let Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> &s;leep till he had explained to me the <HI>Latin</HI>
Sentence in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Letter; which, at my Reque&s;t, he did. And,
indeed, none but &s;uch a wicked Wit could have contrived to turn the Words of
our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, &s;o as to make them convey a very impure, as well as
a mo&s;t uncharitable, Idea to the Mind.</P>
<P>Feuds ran &s;o high between my Mother and Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI>
that my Life became very unhappy. So we determined to quit my Father's Hou&s;e
for a little one of our own, which my Hu&s;band's Father made us a Pre&s;ent
of; and which, by the Bounty of our Friends, who came a Hou&s;e|warming 
<PB N="88" REF="95"> to us, was &s;oon elegantly fur|ni&s;hed; there was a
large Garden to it, which Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> laid out in a mo&s;t beautiful
Ta&s;te, and built a delightful Sum|mer-hou&s;e in it, fit indeed for a
Nobleman; here we u&s;ually entertained our Friends; here al&s;o we both
invoked the Mu&s;e. Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> coming in Curate, (by the Remo|val
of Dr. <HI>Owens</HI> to a Living, of who&s;e Behaviour to me in my
Misfortunes, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak) and by having the Honour of
being Chaplain to Lady <HI>Charlemont,</HI> with an annual Allowance I had from
my Father, our Income was about one hundred Pounds a Year; &s;o that having no
Rent to pay, and having my Father's Coach and Table always at our Command, we
could, in &s;o cheap a Coun|try as <HI>Ireland,</HI> live in a very decent
Man|ner; as Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> mentions our doing in a Letter of his to Mr.
<HI>Pope,</HI> now pub|li&s;hed among&s;t others.</P>
<P>The Dean came to dine with us in our <HI>Lilliputian</HI> Palace,
as he called it, and who could have thought it? He ju&s;t looked into the
Parlour, and ran up into the Gar|ret, <PB N="89" REF="96"> then into my
Bed-chamber and Li|brary, and from thence down to the Kit|chen; and well it was
for me that the Hou&s;e was very clean; for he compli|mented me on it, and told
me, 
<Q REND="inline">'That was his Cu&s;tom; and that 'twas from the
Cleanline&s;s of the Garret and Kitchen he judged of the good Hou&s;ewifery of
the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e; for no doubt, but a Slut would have the Rooms
clean, where the Gue&s;ts were to be entertained.'</Q></P>
<P>He really was &s;ometimes very rude, even to his Superiors, of
which the following Story, related to me by him&s;elf, may &s;erve as one
In&s;tance among&s;t a thou&s;and others.</P>
<P>The la&s;t time he was in <HI>London,</HI> he went to dine with
the Earl of <HI>Burlington,</HI> who was then but newly married. My Lord being
willing, I &s;uppo&s;e, to have &s;ome Di|ver&s;ion, did not introduce him to
his La|dy, nor mention his Name: 'Tis to be ob&s;erved, his Gown was generally
very ru&s;ty, and his Per&s;on no way extraordinary.&mdash;After Dinner, &s;aid
the Dean, 
<Q REND="inline">'Lady <HI>Burlington,</HI> I hear you can &s;ing;
&s;ing me a Song.'</Q> The Lady looked on this <PB N="90" REF="97">
unceremonious manner of a&s;king a Favour with Di&s;ta&s;te, and po&s;itively
refu&s;ed him. He &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould &s;ing, or he would make her. 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, Madam, I &s;uppo&s;e you take me for one of
your poor paul|try <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hedge Par&s;ons; &s;ing, when I bid
you.'</Q> As the Earl did nothing but laugh at this Freedom, the Lady was &s;o
vexed that &s;he bur&s;t into Tears, and retired.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t Compliment to her, when he &s;aw her again, was, 
<Q REND="inline">'Pray, Madam, are you as proud and as ill-natured
now, as when I &s;aw you la&s;t?'</Q> To which &s;he an|&s;wered with great
good Humour,&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">'No, Mr. Dean; I'll &s;ing for you, if you
plea&s;e.'</Q>&mdash;From which time he con|ceived great E&s;teem for her. But
who that knew him would take offence at his Bluntne&s;s? It &s;eems Queen
<HI>Caroline</HI> did not, if we may credit his own Lines, wherein he declares,
That he 
<Q> 
<L>With Princes kept a due Decorum,</L> 
<L>But never &s;tood in Awe before 'em;</L> 
<L><PB N="91" REF="98">And to the pre&s;ent Queen, God ble&s;s

<L>She thought it his peculiar Whim,</L> 
<L>Nor took it ill&mdash;as come from him.</L> 
<BIBL>SWIFT, on his own Death.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I cannot recollect that ever I &s;aw the Dean laugh; perhaps he
thought it beneath him; for when any Plea&s;antry pa&s;&s;ed, which might have
excited it, he u&s;ed to &s;uck in his Cheeks, as Folks do when they have a
Plug of Tobacco in their Mouths, to avoid Ri&s;ibility. He frequent|ly put me
in mind of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s De&s;crip|tion of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius:</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>He is a great Di&s;cerner, and he looks</L>

<L>Seldom he &s;miles, and &s;miles in &s;uch a &s;ort</L> 
<L>As if he mock'd him&s;elf, and &s;corn'd his Spirit,</L> 
<L>That could be mov'd to &s;mile at any thing.</L> 
<BIBL>JULIUS CAESAR.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>As the Dean, and, after his Example, Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> were
eternally &s;atyrizing and <PB N="92" REF="99"> ridiculing the <HI>Female</HI>

black and blue Favours I received at his Hands, were meant for Merit, tho'
be|&s;towed on me. Yet tho', to my Shame I own it, I was fond of Admiration to

SWIFT,</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>But as I have mentioned Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s being in
<HI>London,</HI> I ought al&s;o to inform my Reader what Inducement he had to
quit his Family for a whole Year, which was as fol|lows. Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>
had, in Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Reign, been the fir&s;t Promoter of Alderman
<HI>Barber,</HI> who afterwards by many lucky Ac|cidents ro&s;e to be Lord
Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> which Station he filled with di&s;tingui&s;hed
Abilities, and retained &s;o grateful a Sen&s;e of the Dean's Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ur to him, that he made him the
Compliment of nominating a Chap|lain to him; the Dean offered this Honour to
Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> who gladly accepted of <PB N="115" REF="122"> it, and
came home in high Spirits to ac|quaint me with his Preferment; but what|ever
Joy it brought to him, I was quite &s;unk in Sorrow at the Thoughts of parting
for &s;o long a Time with one I &s;o dearly loved. All his Friends were
again&s;t his going; and the late Primate Dr. <HI>Hoadly,</HI> then
Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Dublin,</HI> remon&s;trated to him, that &s;erving under a
Per&s;on &s;o re|markably di&s;affected as the Alderman, might very probably
prejudice him in the Eyes of the Government; but all in vain. Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> was ever ra&s;h, ob&s;tinate, and &s;elf-willed; and
&s;hould I add treacherous, cruel, and ungrateful, I &s;hould not wrong the
Truth; but however unwilling I am to &s;peak har&s;hly of the Hu&s;band of my
Youth, and the Father of my Children, I mu&s;t draw his Character, wherein I
will 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;Nothing extenuate,</L> 
<L>Nor &s;et down aught in
Malice.</L><BIBL>Othello.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>That he is both a Scholar, and a Man of Genius, all who know him
mu&s;t allow; but like Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> he is &s;o plagued with Envy, 
<PB N="116" REF="123"> that he even hated me becau&s;e I could write, and took
an invincible Aver&s;ion to Coun|&s;ellor <HI>Smith,</HI> becau&s;e he excelled
him on the Harp&s;ichord. It happened one Evening that this Gentleman &s;ung
and played to us the Oratorio of Queen <HI>E&s;ther</HI>; unfortunate|ly for me
I was &s;o charmed with it, that at the Conclu&s;ion of the Mu&s;ic I wrote the
following Lines. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To <HI>JOHN SMITH,</HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MUSIC once more her antient Pow'r di&s;plays,</L>

<L>Our corre&s;pondent Hearts obey thy Hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who can untouch'd attend the awful Sound?</L>
<L>When &s;welling Notes proclaim <HI>Jehovah</HI>
crown'd.</L>
<L>Borne on the hallow'd Strains our Souls ari&s;e,</L>
<L>Till Heav'n &s;eems pre&s;ent to our ravi&s;h'd Eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="117" REF="124">
<L>When to its Source thy Soul &s;hall wing its Flight,</L>
<L>And with eternal Harmony unite,</L>
<L>Thy &s;kilful Hand &s;hall heav'nly Joys im|prove,</L>
<L>And add new Rapture to the Bli&s;s above.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>As the Lines were wrote off-hand, as, to &s;ay the Truth, every
Thing of mine is, for I am too volatile to revi&s;e or correct any thing I
write, Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> complimented Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> on having a Wife
who could write better than him&s;elf, he &s;uppo&s;ing Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>
to be &s;o much the Lover, that he would be delighted with my Prai&s;e, and
join in it. But, lack-a-day! he little knew what I was to &s;uffer for the
Superiority of Genius he was plea&s;ed to a&s;cribe to me. I then was
continually told with a contemp|tuous jibing Air, O my Dear! a Lady of your
Accompli&s;hments! why Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> &s;ays you write better than I; and
to be &s;ure he is a great Judge! But another unlucky Accident likewi&s;e
happened: How fatal to me has Prai&s;e been! We &s;upped at the 
<PB N="118" REF="125"> Dean's, and I had been reading out, by his Command,
&s;ome of his pro&s;aic Work; he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay I acquitted my&s;elf
&s;o well, that I &s;hould have a Gla&s;s of his be&s;t Wine, and &s;ent Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> to the Cellar for it. The Dean in the mean Time &s;aid to
me, 
<Q REND="inline">'I would have every Man write his own
<HI>Engli&s;h.</HI>'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'To be &s;ure, Sir, &s;aid I, that would be
be&s;t.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, to be &s;ure, Sir; you give me an An&s;wer,
and P&mdash;x take you, I am &s;ure you do not under|&s;tand my Meaning.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Very po&s;&s;ible, Sir; but I certainly
under&s;tand my own, when I have any.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well then, what do you under&s;tand by writing
one's own <HI>Eng|li&s;h?</HI>'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why really, Sir, not to confine one's &s;elf to a
Set of Phra&s;es, as &s;ome of our antient <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torians,
<HI>Camden</HI> in particular, &s;eems to have done, but to make u&s;e of
&s;uch Words as naturally oc|cur on the Subject.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Hu&s;h! &s;ays he, your Hu&s;band is coming; I
will put the &s;ame Que&s;tion to him.'</Q> He did &s;o; and Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> an&s;wered, 
<Q REND="inline">'To be &s;ure a Man ought to write good
<HI>Engli&s;h.</HI>'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay, but his own <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; I &s;ay his
own; <PB N="119" REF="126"> what do you under&s;tand by that?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, Sir, &s;aid he, what &s;hould I
un|der&s;tand?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'P&mdash;x on you for a Dunce, &s;aid he; were
your Wife and you to &s;it for a Fellow&s;hip, I would give her one &s;ooner
than admit you a Sizar.'</Q></P>
<P>And now my Bu&s;ine&s;s was compleatly done. Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> viewed me with &s;cornful, yet with jealous Eyes. And tho' I
never pre&s;umed to vye with him for Pre|eminence, well knowing he not only
&s;urpa&s;|&s;ed me in natural Talents, but al&s;o had the Advantage of having
tho&s;e Talents im|proved by Learning; and was &s;en&s;ible the Compliments I
received were rather paid to me as a Woman, in whom any thing a Degree above
Ignorance appears &s;urpriz|ing, than to any Merit I really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed;
he thought proper to in&s;ult me every Mo|ment. Indeed he did not beat me,
which &s;ome of the good-natured Ladies have brought as an Argument that he was
an ex|cellent Hu&s;band; but how a Clergyman &s;hould &s;trike a Wife, who
never contra|dicted him, and who was the mo&s;t remark|ably gentle, even of her
own &s;oft Sex, I <PB N="120" REF="127"> know not. Be&s;ides, I had then a dear
and honoured Father to protect me. I am &s;ure I may &s;ay with
<HI>Ophelia,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>My Violets all wither'd when he dy'd.</L></Q> Then was I left
defencele&s;s to all the In|juries my Hu&s;band's &s;ubtle Cruelty could
devi&s;e again&s;t open un&s;u&s;pecting Innocence.</P>
<P>Another trivial Accident al&s;o offended my Hu&s;band. He was one
Winter's Eve|ning reading <HI>Horace,</HI> and &s;aid he would engage to write
an Ode exactly in his Man|ner; &s;o he directly &s;et about it. The Fan|cy came
into my Head to write one al&s;o, though I under&s;tood not a Word of
<HI>Latin,</HI> nor knew no more of the Poet than from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Tran&s;lations. My Lines were as follow: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>An <HI>ODE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>I Envy not the Proud their Wealth,</L>
<L>Their Equipage and State;</L>
<L>Give me but Innocence and Health,</L>
<L>I a&s;k not to be great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="121" REF="128">
<L>I in this &s;weet Retirement find</L>
<L>A Joy unknown to Kings,</L>
<L>For Scepters to a virtuous Mind,</L>
<L>Seem vain and empty Things.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great <HI>Cincinnatus</HI> at his Plough,</L>
<L>With brighter Lu&s;tre &s;hone,</L>
<L>Than guilty <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> e'er cou'd &s;hew,</L>
<L>Tho' &s;eated on a Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tumultuous Days, and re&s;tle&s;s Nights,</L>
<L>Ambition ever knows,</L>
<L>A Stranger to the calm Delights</L>
<L>Of Study and Repo&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then free from Envy, Care, and Strife,</L>
<L>Keep me, ye Powers divine;</L>
<L>And pleas'd, when ye demand my Life,</L>
<L>May I that Life re&s;ign.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>As I had fini&s;hed my Ta&s;k fir&s;t, I &s;hewed it to Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> who, contrary to my Expectation, (for I imagined he would
be plea&s;ed) was very angry, and told me the Dean had made me mad, that the
Lines were Non&s;en&s;e, and that a Needle became <PB N="122" REF="129"> a
Woman's Hand better than a Pen and Ink. So to bring him into Temper I prai&s;ed
his Ode highly, and threw my own into the Fire. And here let me &s;eriou&s;ly
advi&s;e every Lady, who has the Misfortune to be poetically turned, never to
marry a Poet, but remember <HI>Swift</HI>'s Lines: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>What Poet wou'd not grieve to &s;ee</L>
<L>His Friends cou'd write as well as he;</L>
<L>And rather than be thus out-done,</L>
<L>He'd hang them every Mother's Son.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Her End when Emulation mi&s;&s;es,</L>
<L>She turns to Envy, Stings and Hi&s;&s;es;</L>
<L>The &s;tronge&s;t Friend&s;hip yields to Pride,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s the Odds be on our Side.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>And if a Man cannot bear his Friend &s;hould write, much le&s;s
can he endure it in his Wife; it &s;eems to &s;et them too much upon a Level
with their Lords and Ma&s;ters; and this I take to be the true Rea&s;on why
even Men of Sen&s;e di&s;countenance Learning in Women, and commonly chu&s;e
for Mates the mo&s;t illiterate and &s;tupid of the Sex; and 
<PB N="123" REF="130"> then ble&s;s their Stars their Wife is not a Wit.</P>
<P>But if a Remark be true, which I have &s;omewhere read, that <HI>a
fooli&s;h Woman never brought forth a wi&s;e Son,</HI> I think the Gentle|men
&s;hould have &s;ome Regard to the Intel|lects of tho&s;e they e&s;pou&s;e.</P>
<P>But to return from this long tho' nece&s;&s;a|ry Digre&s;&s;ion,
and take things a little more in their Order. Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> contrary
to every body's Advice, who had any Re|gard for him, went for <HI>England.</HI>
I was very de&s;irous of going with him; but he told me plainly he did not want
&s;uch an In|cumbrance as a Wife, and that he did not intend to pa&s;s there
for a married Man; and that in &s;hort he could not ta&s;te any Plea&s;ure
where I was. As this was a Secret I did not know before, I received it with
A&s;to|ni&s;hment; for amid&s;t all his <HI>wayward Moods,</HI> I ever imagined
till then that he loved me, and that the many ill natured Speeches he made me
were rather the Effect of a bad Temper, than any &s;ettled Aver&s;ion he had
taken again&s;t me; e&s;pecially as I ob&s;erved he treated every body with
Con|tempt, <PB N="124" REF="131"> even Per&s;ons every Way &s;uperior to him
(the Dean alone excepted, to whom he paid even a &s;ervile Complai&s;ance.) And
tho' he now fairly plucked off the Ma&s;k, and let me &s;ee my Mi&s;take, I
could hardly give him Credit; &s;o unwilling are we to believe Truth, when it
runs counter to our Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The next Day he went on board the Yacht in Company with Mr.
<HI>Edward Walpole,</HI> to whom he was recommended by a Man of Quality &s;ince
dead, and left me and my three Children almo&s;t without an Adieu: So eagerly
did he &s;eek his own De&s;truction.</P>
<P>I am hardly able to de&s;cribe the various Emotions with which my
Heart was agitated on his Departure. Love, Grief, and Re|&s;entment for his
la&s;t Speech, by Turns po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it. However, I received a very kind
Letter from him from <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> which made me a little ea&s;y; and as
my Friends &s;eldom permitted me to be alone, I did not give much way to
Melancholy.</P>
<P>I believe it will be expected from the general Reflections I have
thrown out a|gain&s;t the Clergy, that I &s;hould de&s;cend to 
<PB N="125" REF="132"> Particulars, and expo&s;e by Name the Guilty; but this
invidious Ta&s;k I mu&s;t decline: Be|&s;ides, as <HI>Angelo</HI> &s;ays in
<HI>Mea&s;ure for Mea|&s;ure,</HI> when he is tempting a Virgin, and &s;he
threatens to expo&s;e him; 
<Q> 
<L>Who will believe thee, <HI>I&s;abel?</HI></L> 
<L>My un&s;oil'd Name, th' Au&s;terene&s;s of my Life,</L> 
<L>My Intere&s;t in the State, may vouch again&s;t you,</L> 
<L>That you &s;hall &s;tifle in your own Report,</L> 
<L>And &s;mell of Calumny.</L></Q> Be&s;ides, I &s;hould arm a
formidable Body again&s;t me, who would not fail, &s;ooner or later, to take
ample Vengeance. <HI>As unfor|giving as a Churchman,</HI> is become
prover|bial; &s;o, as I am a Sort of a Prie&s;te&s;s, I will, like a faithful
Mother-Confe&s;&s;or, keep the Secrets of my gho&s;tly Brethren.</P>
<P>I have another Inducement to Silence, not I mu&s;t own quite &s;o
good-natured, which is, that I have a malignant Plea&s;ure in keeping tho&s;e
in Awe, who awe all the World be&s;ide, which I &s;hould lo&s;e the Mo|ment 
<PB N="126" REF="133"> I had done my wor&s;t. I remember a certain Gentleman,
who happening to be guilty of a venial Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion with a mean Woman,
it unluckily manife&s;ted it&s;elf: The Gentleman was young, and had a very
&s;evere Father, who gave him but a &s;canty Allowance, all of which did not
&s;atisfy the mercenary Wretch of a Woman, who hop|ing to gain more, went and
told her Story to his Father; the Con&s;equence of which was, that &s;he never
afterwards had a Shil|ling from either. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>The dulle&s;t Genius cannot fail,</L>
<L>To take the Moral of the Tale.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>So let the &s;tricken Deer go weep,</L>
<L>The Hart ungall'd go play.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>The Innocent cannot take Offence, and for the Guilty, I will for
the pre&s;ent with the charitable Gho&s;t in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>Leave them to Heav'n,</L> 
<L>And to the Thorn that in their Bo&s;oms lodge,</L> 
<L>To prick and goad them there.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="134">But once more to gather up my Clue. I
received &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately tender a Letter from <HI>London</HI> from Mr.

down to an&s;wer it, without the lea&s;t Intention of Rhyming, the following

<P>The Dean had given Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> Let|ters of
Recommendation to &s;everal eminent Per&s;ons in <HI>England,</HI> and
among&s;t the re&s;t, one to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>; who, no &s;ooner received it,
but he invited Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> to pa&s;s a Fortnight with him at
<HI>Twickenham,</HI> he not being yet entered on his Office of Chaplain. I
received from him from thence a Letter filled with Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s
Prai&s;es, and the ex|traordinary Regard he &s;hewed him, intro|ducing him to
&s;everal Noblemen, and even oppre&s;&s;ing him with Civilities, which he
mode&s;tly attributed to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Re&s;pect for the Dean, and
hand&s;omely acknowledg|ed the Obligation. As I thought this a very proper
Letter to communicate, I went directly with it to the Deanery. The Dean read it
over with a fix'd Attention, and re|turning it to me, he told me, he had, by
the &s;ame Pacquet, received a Letter from Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> which, with
&s;omewhat of a &s;tern Brow, he put into my Hand, and walked 
<PB N="130" REF="137"> out into the Garden. I was &s;o &s;tartled at his
Au&s;terity, that I was for &s;ome Minutes unable to open it, and when I did,
the Con|tents greatly a&s;toni&s;hed me. The Sub&s;tance of it was, that he
had, in pure Complai|&s;ance to the Dean, entertained Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>;
but that he was &s;urpri&s;ed he &s;hould be &s;o mi&s;taken, to recommend him
as a mode&s;t ingenious Man, who was a mo&s;t forward, &s;hallow, conceited
Fellow: That in the Hope of having an agreeable Companion, he had invited him
to pa&s;s a Fortnight with him, which he heartily repented, being &s;ick of his
Impertinence, before the End of the third Day; and a great deal more, much to
the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. By the time I had read it thro', the Dean returned, and
a&s;ked me, what I thought of it? I told him, I was &s;ure Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> did not de&s;erve the Character Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> had given
of him; and that he was highly ungenerous to care&s;s and abu&s;e him at the
&s;ame time. Upon this the Dean lo&s;t all Patience, and flew into &s;uch a
Rage, that he quite terrified me; he a&s;ked me, Why I did not &s;wear that my
Hu&s;band was &s;ix Foot high? And, Did I <PB N="131" REF="138"> think my&s;elf
a better Judge than Mr. <HI>Pope?</HI> or, Did I pre&s;ume to give him the Lie?
and a thou&s;and other Extravagancies. As I dur&s;t not venture to &s;peak a
Word more, my Heart &s;welled &s;o that I bur&s;t into Tears, which, he
attributing to Pride and Re&s;ent|ment, made him, if po&s;&s;ible, ten times
more angry, and I am not &s;ure he would not have beat me; but that,
fortunately for me, a Gentleman came to vi&s;it him. As I was in a violent
Pa&s;&s;ion of Tears, the Dean did not bring him into the Room where I was, but
went to receive him in another, and I gladly laid hold of that opportunity of
making my e&s;cape from his Wrath.</P>
<P>The next Morning early I wrote him a Letter, expre&s;&s;ive of the
Anxiety I was un|der, le&s;t I had any way offended him; and a&s;&s;ured him,
which was Truth, my Tears did not flow from Pride, but from the Ap|prehen&s;ion
I had, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> might in|fluence him to withdraw his Favour from
us. I added on my own Part, that even if I was partial to Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> I hoped it was the mo&s;t pardonable Error a Wife could be
guilty of; and concluded with begging, if <PB N="132" REF="139"> he had any
Regard for my Peace, he would honour me with an An&s;wer. By the Re|turn of the
Me&s;&s;enger I received the fol|lowing Lines: 
<LETTER>

</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="140">Accordingly I waited on the Dean about five
o'Clock in the Evening, an Hour I knew he would be free from Company. He

me the Poem he wrote on his own Death; when I came to that Part of it, 
<Q>

<L>How is the Dean? He's ju&s;t alive.</L></Q> I was &s;o

neither &s;hew it to any body, nor copy it, and that I &s;hould &s;end it to
him <PB N="134" REF="141"> by Eight o'Clock the next Morning; all which I
punctually performed.</P>
<P>But the Dean did not know what &s;ort of a Memory I had, when he
intru&s;ted me with his Ver&s;e: I had no occa&s;ion for any other Copy, than
what I had regi&s;tred in the <HI>Book and Volume of my Brain:</HI> I could
repeat the whole Poem, and could not forbear delighting &s;ome particular
Friends with a Rehear&s;al of it. This reached the Dean's Ear, who imagined I
plaid him fal&s;e, and &s;ent for me to come to him. When I entered, he told
me, I had broke my Word with him, and con&s;equently for|feited all the good
Opinion he had ever conceived of me. I looked, as I think he generally made me
do, like a Fool; I a&s;ked what I had done? He told me, I had copied his Poem,
and &s;hewn it round the Town. I a&s;&s;ured him, I had not. He &s;aid I lyed,
and produced a Poem &s;ome|thing like it, publi&s;hed in <HI>London,</HI> and
told me, from reading it about, that odd Bur|le&s;que on it had taken ri&s;e.
He bade me read it, aloud. I did &s;o, and could not forbear laughing, as I
plainly perceived, <PB N="135" REF="142" MS="y"> tho' he had endeavoured to
di&s;gui&s;e his Stile, that the Dean had burle&s;qued him&s;elf; and made no
manner of &s;cruple to tell him &s;o. He pretended to be very angry, a&s;ked
me, did I ever know him write Triplets? and told me, I had neither Ta&s;te nor
Judgment, and knew no more of Poetry than a Hor&s;e. I told him I would
confe&s;s it, provided he would &s;eriou&s;ly give me his Word, he did not
write that Poem. He &s;aid, P&mdash;x take me for a Dunce. I then a&s;&s;ured
him, I did not copy his Poem; but added, when I read any thing peculiar|ly
charming, I never forgot it; and that I could repeat not only all his Works,
but all <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s, which I put to this Trial; I de&s;ired him to
open any Part of it, and read a Line, and I would engage to go on with the
whole Speech; as we were in his Library, he directly made the Experiment: The
Line he fir&s;t gave me, he had pur|po&s;ely picked out for its &s;ingular
Oddne&s;s: 
<Q> 
<L>But rancours in the Ve&s;&s;el of my Peace.</L> 
<BIBL>Macbeth.</BIBL></Q> <PB N="136" REF="143"> I readily went
on with the whole Speech, and did &s;o &s;everal times, that he tried me with
different Plays. The Dean then took down <HI>Hudibras,</HI> and ordered me to
examine him in it, as he had done me in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>; and, to my great
Surprize, I found he re|membered every Line, from Beginning to End of it. I
&s;ay, it &s;urprized me, becau&s;e I had been mi&s;led by Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s
Remark, 
<Q> 
<L>That where Beams of warm Imagination play,</L> 
<L>The Memory's &s;oft Figures melt away.</L> 
<BIBL>E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m.</BIBL></Q> To think Wit and
Memory incompatible things. I told the Dean he had convinced me the old Proverb
was fal&s;e; and, indeed, I know not how any Per&s;on can be witty without a
good Memory. When I returned home, I found I had not been mi&s;taken in the
Opinion I had conceived, that the Dean had burle&s;qued his own Poem. I had a
Confirmation of it in a Letter from Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> to whom he had
&s;ent it, to have it printed in <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P>My Reader may now plainly perceive, I was mo&s;t incorrigibly
devoted to Ver&s;ifying, and all my Spou&s;e's whole&s;ome Admoni|tions had no
manner of Effect on me: In &s;hort, I believe this &s;cribbling Itch is an
in|curable Di&s;ea&s;e; for tho' <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Art of Poetry.</NOTE>, taking &s;ome Phy&s;ic in the
Spring rid him <PB N="140" REF="147"> of it, yet, as he even relates this in
flowing Numbers, we have no Cau&s;e to give him Credit. He al&s;o declares, all
Poets are vi&s;ibly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and mad. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;eems
to be of the &s;ame opinion, tho' he de&s;cribes it with greater Elegance than
even <HI>Horace</HI> has done, at lea&s;t in the Tran&s;lation. 
<Q> 
<L>The Poet's Eye, in a fine Frenzy rolling,</L> 
<L>Doth glance from Heav'n to Earth, from Earth to Heav'n;</L> 
<L>And as Imagination bodies forth</L> 
<L>The Forms of Things unknown, the Poet's Pen</L> 
<L>Turns them to Shapes, and gives to airy Nothing</L> 
<L>A local Habitation and a Name.</L></Q> The Truth of which he
has fully verified, giving us in his divine Works a new Crea|tion of his own,
with a new Language al&s;o peculiar to the different Species and Orders of
Beings he introduces to us. <HI>Milton</HI> had, &s;tudied him with Care, and,
like the Bee, committed many &s;weet Thefts on his im|mortal Blooms. Whoever
reads the Part <PB N="141" REF="148"> of the Fairies in the <HI>Mid&s;ummer
Night's Dream,</HI> may ea&s;ily perceive how many beautiful Images
<HI>Milton</HI> has borrowed thence to adorn his Ma&s;que of <HI>Comus.</HI>
And really, I think, as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had plun|dered all Art and
Nature, the vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible World, it was but ju&s;t to make
Reprizals, and &s;teal from his rich Store.</P>
<P>I hope my Reader will pardon me for &s;o often running away from
<HI>my&s;elf</HI>; I can|not &s;ay, I am <HI>Egoti&s;t</HI> enough to be much
enamoured of &s;uch an unhappy Theme, and have often wi&s;hed I could do it in
rea|lity; for I have been plunged in &s;uch Ca|lamity, that I have even thought
it impo&s;|&s;ible to be true, and vainly hoped to wake, as from &s;ome hideous
Dream, to find a better Fate.</P>
<P>And as one travelling in a barren Wa&s;te, could not be
di&s;plea&s;ed to be &s;ometimes led out of the direct Road to view a more
a|greeable Pro&s;pect, I deal thus with my Readers, and turn them from the

<P>Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> who loved me be&s;t at a Di&s;tance, wrote
me a very kind Letter, wherein he told me my Ver&s;es were like my&s;elf, full
of Elegance and Beauty; that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> and others, whom he had &s;hewn
them to, longed to &s;ee the Writer; and that he heartily wi&s;hed me in
<HI>London.</HI> And this put the Fancy into my Head of going there; and as
&s;ome of my Acquaintance intended for it, with whom I thought I could
agreeably travel, I &s;oon re&s;olved to accompany them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> had been ab&s;ent nine Months; a tedious
Time in a Lover's Reckoning. In three Months Time his Office expired; for every
new Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> has a new Chaplain; &s;o I thought I &s;hould
have the Plea&s;ure of pa&s;&s;ing the Winter in <HI>London,</HI> and then, if
nothing bet|ter <PB N="154" REF="161"> offered, we &s;hould return home
toge|ther. <HI>London</HI> has very attractive Charms for mo&s;t People, as our
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Nobility and Gentry &s;ufficiently evidence, by &s;pending the
greate&s;t Part of their Time and Fortune there; and can it be wondered at,
that a young lively Woman &s;hould be fond of taking the only Opportunity &s;he
might ever have of &s;eeing its Magnificence in Perfec|tion. Well! but how to
execute my Pro|ject; for I was apprehen&s;ive if either my own Parents or Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s were ac|quainted with it, they would prevent me; &s;o I
re&s;olved to make but one Confidante, which was a very faithful Servant, who
in the Evening put my Portmanteau aboard the Yacht. Next Morning, the Wind
being fair, I went, under Pretence of &s;eeing my Friends &s;afe aboard, down
the River with them, and into the Ship as it were out of Curio&s;ity; but being
then out of Dan|ger of Pur&s;uit, I told them my Intention, which &s;ome
approved of, and &s;ome blamed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
However, as I did not que&s;tion a kind Re+ception from my Hu&s;band, and knew
my Children would be well taken care of by m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <PB N="155" REF="162"> Parents, I was very chearful and ea&s;y, and
little regarded what was thought of my Frolick; neither could I divine that any
evil Con&s;truction would be put upon it.</P>
<P>We had a very &s;afe Pa&s;&s;age, and a plea|&s;ant Journey. I
wrote to Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> from <HI>Parkgate,</HI> and he and Mr.
<HI>W&mdash;e</HI> met me about four Miles Di&s;tance from <HI>London.</HI> So
I took leave of my Fellow-Travellers for the pre&s;ent, and went into the Coach
to them, which drove to Mr. <HI>W&mdash;le</HI>'s. Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>
received me very obligingly, and called me his little Fu|gitive and Run-away;
but a Stranger would have thought Mr. <HI>W&mdash;le</HI> was my Hu&s;|band, he
welcomed me &s;o kindly, and paid me &s;o many Compliments. As I had been up at
three o'Clock in the Morning, I was heartily fatigued, and de&s;ired Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> to take leave; but he whi&s;pered me to in|vite Mr.
<HI>W&mdash;le</HI> home to Supper with us, which accordingly I did; and he was
&s;o tran&s;ported with this Civility, he could not conceal his Joy; whatever I
commended among&s;t his Paintings, he would force me to accept of; and putting
as many Bottles <PB N="156" REF="163"> of Wine into the Coach-Box as it would
conveniently hold, we went to Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s Lodging, which I found
very hand&s;ome and convenient. Wine and good Chear enter|tained us till
Midnight to our mutual Satis|factions.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> and I were alone, he told me, that
tho' he was very glad to &s;ee me, he was afraid I would have but a lonely Time
of it in <HI>London,</HI> he being ob|liged to attend on the Lord Mayor, from
Nine in the Morning till Six in the Eve|ning, and from thence he always went to
the Play, and afterwards to Supper to Mrs. <HI>Heron,</HI> one of the
Actre&s;&s;es, of no very good Fame. Though I thought this but an odd Manner of
Life for a Clergyman, I did not &s;ay &s;o, being unwilling to offend him. I
had heard it whi&s;pered, that he liked this Woman, but I re&s;olved patient|ly
to wait the Event.</P>
<P>The next Day, when he was going out, I put him in Mind that Mr.
<HI>W&mdash;le</HI> &s;aid he would pa&s;s the Evening with us; but he laughed
at my believing it; and &s;aid he was a Man &s;o uncertain in his Temper, that
per|haps <PB N="157" REF="164"> I might never &s;ee him again while I lived.
Ju&s;t then a Lady who came over with me, called on us; and Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> and &s;he had &s;ome private Chat. When &s;he was gone he
told me, &s;he had brought him a Letter and &s;ome Poetry from the Dean, which
he had ordered him to di&s;po&s;e of, and put the Money in his own Pocket; as
he could not &s;tay to read them, he took them with him to the Lord
Mayor's.</P>
<P>However, Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> was mi&s;taken in imagining Mr.
<HI>W&mdash;le</HI> would fail in his Appointment; he came and told me Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> was at the Play, but would &s;up with us. He made u&s;e of
his Ab&s;ence to compliment me at an unmerciful Rate, and &s;ung me all the
tendere&s;t Love Songs he could think of in the mo&s;t pathetic Manner: In
&s;hort, he exerted his Talents to entertain me, and behaved him&s;elf &s;o
much in the Stile of a Lover, that had I not been married, I &s;hould have
imagined, he intended to addre&s;s me. When Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> returned, he
told him, he was certainly the happie&s;t Man living, and won|dered how he
could be a Moment out of <PB N="158" REF="165"> my Company, where he could
&s;tay for ever. Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> &s;eemed much plea&s;ed with his
Gallantry, and &s;aid, he hoped I would induce him to &s;ee us often. When we
were alone, he told me, he believed his Friend was in love with me. I
an&s;wered, if he thought &s;o, I wondered he gave him &s;o warm an Invitation.
He &s;aid, he was a very generous Man, and that his liking to me, if well
managed, might prove very profitable; for he valued no Expence where a Lady was
in the Ca&s;e. So, it &s;eems, I was to be the Bait, wherewith he was to angle
for Gold out of a Rival's Pocket: A Scheme which had a twofold Pro&s;pect of
Gain annexed to it; for while a Lover has Hope, he &s;eldom quits the Chace;
and will even thank the Hu&s;band, for taking the friendly Freedom of u&s;ing
his Pur&s;e; and yet &s;hould the Gallant be detected in taking any friendly
Freedoms with the Wife in return, the Law is all again&s;t him, Da|mages and
Impri&s;onment mu&s;t en&s;ue. Which Con&s;ideration may &s;erve as a Warn|ing
to all Men, not to invade Properties, or commit wilful Tre&s;pa&s;s on their
Neigh|bour's Ground.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="166">If my Readers are by this Time the lea&s;t
acquainted with my Spirit, they may judge, I looked on this Project with the
Contempt it de&s;erved; however I promi&s;ed Complai&s;ance, which indeed Mr.
<HI>W&mdash;le</HI>'s &s;eeming Merits might well de&s;erve. The next Day I was
invited to the Lord Mayor's, who, on account of the re&s;olute Oppo&s;ition he
had given to the Exci&s;e Act, was the Darling of the People. He was but
indiffe|rent as to his Per&s;on, or rather homely than otherwi&s;e; but he had
an excellent Under|&s;tanding, and the Liveline&s;s of his Genius &s;hone in
his Eyes, which were very black and &s;parkling. He always treated me with
great Complai&s;ance, and gave me a general Invitation to his Table. As the
Lord Mayor was a Batchelor, he had a Gentle|woman who managed his Hou&s;hold
Af|fairs, and who, except on public Days, did the Honours of his Table. Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> told me &s;he was violently in love with him, and was ready
to run mad upon hearing I was come to <HI>London.</HI> How true this might be I
know not; but as &s;he was very civil to me, and was old enough to 
<PB N="160" REF="167"> be my Mother, I was not the lea&s;t di&s;turb|ed with
Jealou&s;y on her own Account; tho' I can't help &s;aying, &s;he gave me a
great deal of Unea&s;ine&s;s, by relating to me many In&s;tances of my
Hu&s;band's extraor|dinary Regard for the Player afore-men|tioned: We went
together to the Play on Purpo&s;e to &s;ee her; and to do her Ju&s;tice, &s;he
was a graceful, fine Woman; at lea&s;t &s;he appeared &s;uch on the Stage, and
had a peculiar Skill in dre&s;&s;ing to Advantage. Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> and
Mr. <HI>W&mdash;le</HI> were at the Play; they met us going out, and Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> committed me to the Care of his Friend, who had a Coach
waiting to convey me home; but Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> went to his old
Rendezvous to the Actre&s;s, to my very great Mortification; becau&s;e I really
preferred his Conver&s;ation to any other in the World: However, he was &s;o
com|plai&s;ant, he u&s;ed every Evening to &s;end Mr. <HI>W&mdash;le</HI> to
keep me Company, while he pur&s;ued his Plea&s;ures; and, as I &s;hall
an|&s;wer it to Heaven, he did every thing in his power to forward and
encourage an Amour between his Friend and me.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="168">One In&s;tance, out of an hundred I could
produce, I &s;ubmit to the impartial Judgment of my Reader. One of the young
Ladies, at who&s;e Hou&s;e I fir&s;t &s;aw Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> happening to
be in <HI>London,</HI> and but in low Circum&s;tances, came to vi&s;it me;
&s;he in|&s;i&s;ted on my pa&s;&s;ing the next Evening with her, and ju&s;t as
I was going Mr. <HI>W&mdash;le</HI> came in, and offered to accompany me, to
which I gladly con&s;ented, hoping as he was then a Man of Intere&s;t, he might
recom|mend her to &s;ome good Family, as a Go|verne&s;s to Children, or a
Lady's Woman, when he knew how well qualified &s;he was for either Place. As
her Spirit was far a|bove her Ability, I was concerned to &s;ee what Expence
&s;he had put her&s;elf to for my Reception, having provided a very genteel
Supper, to which &s;he would oblige us to &s;tay. While &s;he was giving Orders
for it, I informed Mr. <HI>W&mdash;le</HI> of her Di&s;tre&s;s, who immediately
gave me a Gui|nea for her, but entreated I would give it to her as Pre&s;ent
from my &s;elf, which, as I knew it was the only Method to make her accept of
it, I did.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="169">When I came home, I related to Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> Mr. <HI>W&mdash;le</HI>'s obliging and ge|nerous Behaviour;
but little was he plea&s;ed with the Recital: What could I think of him, when
he told me, I did very ill to in|troduce a new Woman to him, <HI>i. e.</HI> Mr.
<HI>W&mdash;le</HI>; and that he hoped I would lo&s;e him; and that henceforth
he would be&s;tow his Favours on her? A Speech more pro|per for the Mouth of
one of tho&s;e aban|doned Wretches, who live by the Sale of the Innocent, than
for a Hu&s;band, a Gen|tleman, and one who ought to be a Chri&s;|tian. But I
believe he was of Opinion that 
<Q> 
<L>Let the malicious World &s;ay what it plea&s;e,</L> 
<L>The fair Wife makes her Hu&s;band live at ea&s;e.</L></Q> And,
provided he &s;old me well, and <HI>put Money in his Pur&s;e,</HI> little
regarded either my temporal or eternal Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Another In&s;tance either of his extraor|dinary Confidence in my
Fidelity to him, or rather Indifference about it, was, that 
<PB N="163" REF="170"> he obliged me to go alone with his Friend to
<HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> though, as it was Winter, there was no Po&s;&s;ibility of
going there and returning the &s;ame Day, it being twenty Miles di&s;tant from
<HI>London</HI>; &s;o that we had not only two Days, but a Night al&s;o, to
pa&s;s together. Could any Hu&s;band be more obliging to his Rival, than to
give him &s;uch an Opportunity to accompli&s;h his Wi&s;hes? Had mine but
concurred, I had then been undone; for truly the Gentleman tried eve|ry
Argument to win me to them, but in vain. My Hu&s;band's Mi&s;conduct in
expo&s;|ing me to &s;uch Temptation, &s;tung me to the Quick; nay, I could not
help believ|ing they were both in a Plot to betray me to Ruin; and as we were
at the top Inn in the Town, I &s;tarted at every Noi&s;e of Hor&s;emen who
&s;topped there; and con|cluded, though fal&s;ly I believe, that Mr.
<HI>W&mdash;le</HI> had given Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> a Di|rection where to find
us; and as this Ima|ginatlion wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me, I little re|garded
either the Elegance of our Enter|tainment, or the Tenderne&s;s and Pa&s;&s;ion
the Gentleman expre&s;&s;ed in every Word <PB N="164" REF="171"> and Look: His
&s;oft Endearments were all lo&s;t on one who regarded him as an Enemy. I was
ob&s;tinately &s;ullen, and pretended Wea|rine&s;s, on purpo&s;e to quit his
Company; but I lo&s;t all Patience, when calling to the Maid to &s;hew me to my
Chamber, I found there was but one, nay, and but one Bed too, provided for two
Gue&s;ts; for, it &s;eems, my Gentleman had &s;o ordered it, hoping, no doubt,
to &s;upply my Hu&s;band's Place.</P>
<P>I was now in a manner convinced, there was Treachery intended
again&s;t me, and re|proached my de&s;iring Swain in &s;uch bitter Terms, that
he had no Way to prove his Innocence, but by retiring, tho' very re|luctantly,
to another Apartment; and I took &s;pecial Care to barricade my own, not only
double-locking it, but al&s;o placing all the Chairs and Tables again&s;t the
Door to prevent a Po&s;&s;ibility of being &s;urprized.</P>
<P>I ro&s;e very early next Morning to take a Survey of what
Curio&s;ities <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> afforded, as it was too late the Night before
to &s;ee any thing; but found nothing worth Ob|&s;ervation, except the
Ca&s;tle, who&s;e emi|nent Situation and <HI>Gothick</HI> Grandeur, might 
<PB N="165" REF="172"> very well, &s;ome Ages ago, make it e&s;|teemed a
<HI>Non-pareil:</HI> But as it has frequent|ly been de&s;cribed and celebrated,
I &s;hall only &s;ay, that con&s;idering it as the Palace of the
<HI>Edwards</HI> and <HI>Henrys,</HI> I was touched with &s;omething like a
religious Veneration for it, which no modern Building could in&s;pire me
with.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>W&mdash;le</HI> attended me with great Re&s;pect, and
excepting that he tenderly re|proached me with what he called my Cruel|ty the
Night before, gave me no farther Cau&s;e of Di&s;plea&s;ure, but brought me
&s;afely home in his Chai&s;e to Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n.</HI></P>
<P>But pray, gentle Reader, &s;uppo&s;e it had happened otherwi&s;e;
that Night-Solitude, an agreeable and importunate Lover, &s;hould have
prevailed on human, yielding Frailty, whom could my Hu&s;band &s;o properly
have blamed for it as him&s;elf? He who be&s;t knew our Frames, bids us avoid
Tempta|tion, as the &s;ure&s;t Method, nay and per|haps the only one of
avoiding Sin; for who &s;o firm that may not be &s;educed? Why then &s;hould
he, Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> drive me <PB N="166" REF="173"> into the Toils,
unle&s;s he meant to have me made a Prey of?</P>
<P>I fairly confe&s;s this Action greatly &s;unk him in my E&s;teem;
nay, it even did the &s;ame in Mr. <HI>W&mdash;le</HI>'s, e&s;pecially as he
reaped no Satisfaction by it. I could &s;carce|ly after regard Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> as a Hu&s;|band; but rather as a Man who&s;e Proper|ty I
was, and who would gladly di&s;po&s;e of me to the be&s;t Bidder. Shocking
Thought!</P>
<P>And yet this Scheme was &s;o artfully ma|naged, as indeed all his
again&s;t me have ever been, that I could not well reproach him for it; for he
would have alledged, it was a Party of Plea&s;ure intended by him for my Health
and Recreation; and to have mentioned Mr. <HI>W&mdash;le</HI>'s Attempt, why,
to &s;ay the Truth, I looked upon it as a Thing which any Man in the &s;ame
Circum&s;tances might naturally be guilty of, even tho' he had no previous
liking to, or Thought of the Woman. So, as there was no Harm done, I judged it
mo&s;t prudent to be &s;ilent. Be&s;ides, no Faults are &s;o ea|&s;ily pardoned
by our Sex, as tho&s;e we be|lieve to be occa&s;ioned by our own Charms, 
<PB N="167" REF="174"> the eager Lover's con&s;tant Excu&s;e, and which our
Vanity is but too apt to admit as a rea&s;onable one.</P>
<P>Of all Things in Nature, I mo&s;t wonder why Men &s;hould be
&s;evere in their Cen&s;ures on our Sex, for a Failure in Point of Cha&s;ti|ty:
Is it not mon&s;trous, that our Seducers &s;hould be our Accu&s;ers? Will they
not em|ploy Fraud, nay, often Force to gain us? What various Arts, what
Stratagems, what Wiles will they u&s;e for our De&s;truction? but that once
accompli&s;hed, every oppro|brious Term with which our Language &s;o
plentifully abounds, &s;hall be be&s;towed on us, even by the very Villains who
have wronged us. 
<Q> 
<L>O Heav'n that &s;uch Companions thou'd&s;t unfold!</L>

the whole Female Sex will join with me in a hearty <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="175">Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s Year of
Chaplain&s;hip being near expired, I hoped that he would return to <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eland</HI>; but he had entertained a
Belief that Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> would provide for him, and therefore
determined to &s;tay in <HI>London,</HI> &s;o I was forced to return &s;ingle;
for as Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s Income cea&s;ed with his Office, he cho&s;e to
accept of an Offer from Mr. <HI>W&mdash;le</HI> to lodge in his Hou&s;e. For
&s;everal Rea&s;ons I thought it mo&s;t pro|per to revi&s;it my native Country;
the fir&s;t and chief was the Affection I bore to my dear little ones; the
next, to avoid both the Temptation and Scandal I mu&s;t have &s;uffered, by
going into the Hou&s;e of a Per&s;on, who, with regard to Women, had an
avowedly di&s;&s;olute Character.</P>
<P>But however cautiou&s;ly and prudently I acted in this Affair, it
was not my good Fortune to e&s;cape Calumny; &s;o far from it, that I was both
traduced for going to <HI>London,</HI> and for returning from it; and the Wife
of a certain B&mdash;, who invited me to dine with her a Day or two after my
Return to <HI>Dublin,</HI> when we retired to our Tea, abu&s;ed me in Language
I &s;hould have <PB N="169" REF="176"> &s;corned, in re&s;pect to my own
Gentility, to have given to the meane&s;t Servant I was ever Mi&s;tre&s;s of:
And becau&s;e my Hu&s;|band had made me a Pre&s;ent of a few little Trinkets,
all of which in the Expence amounted but to a Trifle, told me &s;he was &s;ure
&s;ome Gallant had given them to me. But, as I have &s;ince been informed,
&s;he was ragingly jealous of me, although without any Rea&s;on, I can the more
readi|ly pardon her inhuman Treatment of me.</P>
<P>But as I did not chu&s;e to bear Re|proaches I did not de&s;erve,
I &s;ent for a Chair, and, bur&s;ting into Tears, left the Room. In the Hall I
met the B&mdash;, who was coming to drink Tea with the Ladies: He was
&s;urprized to &s;ee me &s;o di&s;ordered, and tenderly laying hold of me,
enquired the Cau&s;e. I de&s;ired he would a&s;k his Lady, who had invited me,
to u&s;e me ill: Which he &s;aid, he hoped &s;he would not do, even in Regard
to my Condition (being then pregnant). But, Heaven knows! had he but
con&s;idered how cruel all barren Creatures naturally are, in&s;omuch that I
have &s;een a barren Ewe <PB N="170" REF="177"> attempt to kill a young Lamb;
he would rationally have judged what might have, even in Law, been my
Protection, was the very Cau&s;e of her Hatred and Di&s;plea&s;ure to me.</P>
<P>However, as this Lady was the fir&s;t to attack my Character, I
can do no le&s;s than return her the&s;e my public and grateful
Acknowledgments; for though perhaps half the World cannot tell whom I mean; yet
as it is more than probable the Per&s;on concerned may read over the&s;e
Memoirs, &s;he at lea&s;t will know her own Portrait.</P>
<P>'Tis really a &s;ad Misfortune, that the hone&s;t Liberty of the
Pre&s;s is &s;o &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in <HI>Ireland:</HI> But, however, I promi&s;e
all my Sub&s;cribe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s to oblige them

<P>Vice in Power will command at lea&s;t an outward Homage; and

<P>A few Days after my Return to <HI>Ireland,</HI> Sir <HI>Daniel
Molineux</HI> &s;aid in <HI>French</HI> to my <PB N="171" REF="178"> Brother in
St. <HI>Ann</HI>'s Church, that he was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee me look &s;o
chearful, con&s;i|dering my Hu&s;band was in the <HI>Ba&s;tile.</HI> My Bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">her told it to me; but for my Life I
could not gue&s;s what the Gentleman meant.</P>
<P>But too &s;oon I was informed by the News-Papers, that Mr.

taken up on account of &s;ome trea&s;onable Poetry, which Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> had given to the two latter to print; I then recollected the
Papers afore|mentioned, delivered to him by one of my Female
Fellow-Travellers.</P>
<P>Who was the Informer I know not, both Parties having violently
accu&s;ed each other; but in my Soul I believe Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> was
innocent, and I am &s;ure I have no Rea|&s;on to be partial to him. But certain
it is, his Character &s;uffered &s;o much that it al|mo&s;t broke my Heart, as
it deprived me of any Hopes even of his having Bread for his Family. The Notion
of his having betrayed Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> incen&s;ed the whole Kingdom of
<HI>Ireland</HI> again&s;t him; and as I did not for many Weeks receive a
Letter from him, I knew not how to ju&s;tify him; <PB N="172" REF="179"> and
when called upon by the late Primate (Dr. <HI>Hoadly</HI>) to give him an
Account of the Affair, I could only an&s;wer him with Tears, which, as both he
and his Lady were exceedingly humane, pleaded his Cau&s;e as powerfully as the
mo&s;t moving Eloquence could have done; his Grace bade me be comforted, and
write to my Hu&s;|band to come over and mind his Duty, and he would &s;till be
a Friend to him; and generou&s;ly added, that as many Per|&s;ons bu&s;ied
them&s;elves in bringing Stories to him to Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s
Di&s;advantage, I &s;hould be welcome to his Table every Day, which would
di&s;countenance tho&s;e who endeavoured to prejudice him, when they &s;aw it
did not make him or his Spou&s;e withdraw their Regard from me.</P>
<P>His Grace's Goodne&s;s affected me &s;o much, that my Tears of
Sorrow were converted to tho&s;e of Gratitude; nor could I forbear falling on
my Knees to pay my Acknowledgments to him and his friendly Lady, for the Relief
their Kindne&s;s had given to a Heart overcome with Angui&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="180">At length I received a Letter from Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> which he was obliged to in|clo&s;e to a Gentleman for me,
otherwi&s;e it would have been carried to the Ca&s;tle, and there examined;
&s;o great Notice was taken of the&s;e Poems. He wrote me word he had been ill
of the Rheumati&s;m, and in great Trouble; that he would directly return to
<HI>Ireland,</HI> but that he had not Money to bear his Expences. I made an
Application to my Father for him, who bade me let the Fellow go to the
<HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and he would take care of me and the Children. But,
unfortunately for me, I had too much Good-nature to take this whole&s;ome
Advice; &s;o far from it, that I never cea&s;ed importuning him, but fol|lowed
him from Morning till Night, like <HI>Niobe</HI> all Tears, till he give me a
Bill of twenty Pounds to &s;end to him, with which he came over to
<HI>Ireland</HI>; but &s;o pale and dejected, that he looked like the Gho&s;t
of his former &s;elf; and the Di&s;regard he met with from every body went very
near his Heart. Every Day there was a new Abu&s;e publi&s;hed on him; my Father
battled for <PB N="174" REF="181"> him, and I did every thing in my power to
chear and comfort his Spirits. Com|pa&s;&s;ion wrought now the &s;ame Effects
on me, as Love had done heretofore; and as he frequently wept, I could not
forbear mingling my Tears with his; and, by way of Con&s;olation, wrote to him
the follow|ing Lines.

</LG></Q> </P>
<P>I &s;hould not have dwelt &s;o long on every trivial
Circum&s;tance had I not been &s;trangely traduced about this Affair, which, as
I &s;hall an&s;wer it to God, I have related with the utmo&s;t Truth and
Exactne&s;s. I never had any Breach with Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> till our final
Separation; and I am &s;ure if my Father had &s;u&s;pected me of any
Di&s;|honour, he would &s;ooner have joined with my Hu&s;band to pro&s;ecute
me, than have <PB N="176" REF="183"> given him a &s;ingle Shilling to make up
Matters between us.</P>
<P>Neither can I really imagine what I had done to merit all the
cruel and &s;candalous A&s;per&s;ions thrown on me, e&s;pecially by the Ladies:
It would be infinite Vanity to &s;up|po&s;e Envy had any Share in their gentle
Brea&s;ts; or that the Prai&s;es I received from the other Sex, on Account of
my Writings, awaked their Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t me: For though 
<Q> 
<L>They had no Title to a&s;pire;</L> 
<L>Yet, when I &s;unk, they ro&s;e the high'r.</L></Q></P>
<P>But what I think mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing, is, that Women, who have
&s;uffered in their own Reputations, are generally mo&s;t cruel in their
Cen&s;ures on others. I could men|tion a Lady, who was &s;o fond of a cer|tain
Colonel, that when he died, &s;he was almo&s;t mad, though he was a married
Man; and yet &s;he was heedful of the main Chance, in prevailing on him to
leave her his E&s;tate from his Wife, who&s;e Brother's E&s;tate &s;he had
before &s;ecured to <PB N="177" REF="184"> her&s;elf, he being married to her.
I re|member this Lady the whole Town-talk of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and yet, by
having a large ill|got Fortune, &s;he procured a &s;econd Hu&s;|band, commenced
Prude, though not till Youth and Beauty were fled, and is, if &s;he yet lives,
one of the bittere&s;t Eenmies to any Woman, who has ever committed even an Act
of Indi&s;cretion, that can be found in the World, as I have proved many Years
ago by woful Experience. 
<Q> 
<L>So <HI>Flavia,</HI> full of inward Guilt,</L> 
<L>Calls <HI>Florimel</HI> an arrant Jilt.</L></Q> But enough of
this. When Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> was once more &s;ettled in his Cure, I being
very much inclined to a Decay, my Father &s;aid, nothing would more effectually
re|&s;tore my Health than the Country; &s;o having often been invited to his
Brother's at <HI>Cork,</HI> I re&s;olved on going there for a few Months, where
I was very kindly re|ceived. We took the Diver&s;ions of the Sea&s;on at
<HI>Mallow,</HI> where nothing remark|able happened to me, except that one 
<PB N="178" REF="185"> Gentleman there took it into his Head to do, what they
there call black-guard me ince&s;&s;antly. It was the reigning Humour of the
Place, among&s;t the young Folks, to call Names, &s;ell Bargains, and
&s;ome|times talk indecently, all of which I ab|horred, and therefore this
Gentleman &s;ingled me out as a Mark for this Sort of Wit; and the more he
found it vexed me, the more he per&s;i&s;ted in it. At la&s;t, I very
&s;eriou&s;ly demanded of him, what I had done to provoke him to teize me in
the manner he did? He &s;aid, he heard I was a Wit; and wi&s;hed I would write
a Satire on him. So, to oblige him, I &s;ent him the following Lines, which

<P>And here, gentle Reader, I mu&s;t bid you take leave of the Hope
of any farther chearful Amu&s;ement; here commences the <PB N="181" REF="188">
mournfulle&s;t Tale which ever yet was either told or read.</P>
<P>The Winter's Return brought me to <HI>Dublin.</HI> My Hu&s;band
met me about a Mile from Town, and took me and my Aunt <HI>Van Lewen</HI>'s
Si&s;ter, who came to Town with me, out of the Stage-Coach into a Hackney one.
He entertained me with an Account of a violent Quarrel he had with my Father;
and &s;aid, he hoped, if I had any Regard for him, I would never go with
in&s;ide his Doors. This was a &s;trange Command, and as &s;trange did it
appear to me, that he &s;hould quarrel with the be&s;t natured Gentleman in the
World; his Father in Effect, as he treated him as his Son! I told him, I hoped
he would excu&s;e my once di&s;obeying him; for I owed, if po&s;&s;ible, a
&s;uperior Duty to my Father, than a Hu&s;band could claim. Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> was very angry. This was on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Night: The
next Morning, at all Hazards, I went to wait on my Father, who received me with
a Coldne&s;s, which &s;truck me to the Heart. I a&s;ked him, if I had any way
offended him? He &s;aid, <PB N="182" REF="189"> Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> had
u&s;ed him &s;o ill, he did not de&s;ire to &s;ee his Wife. 
<Q REND="inline">'Dear Sir (&s;aid I) am I not your Daughter?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, (&s;aid he) and had you taken my Advice in
letting the Villain go to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> I &s;hould have regarded
you as &s;uch; but, make much of him; and remember, the Hour will come, when
you will wi&s;h you had followed your Father's Coun&s;el.'</Q> My Aunt's
Si&s;ter was with me, to whom he never once &s;poke, but walked to and fro in a
&s;ort of a di&s;tracted Manner, and looked &s;o ill, that, imagining my
Pre&s;ence di&s;turbed him, I a&s;ked him where my Mother was? He &s;aid, &s;he
was gone to take the Air; and that he had Company to dine with him, &s;o that
he could not a&s;k me to &s;tay. I took the Hint, and departed from him, in
&s;uch inconceivable Sorrow, as I never in my Life experienced before,
becau&s;e I really loved him more than any thing in the World.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the Remainder of the Day in Tears, for my Hu&s;band
never came home till Twelve o'Clock at Night; &s;o that I <PB N="183" REF="190"> had full Liberty to indulge my Sorrow. I &s;ent my Compliments on
<HI>Friday</HI> and <HI>Satur|day</HI> Morning to my Parents; they an&s;wer|ed,
they were very well; but they neither a&s;ked me to come to them, nor came to
me.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> I was invited to Dinner to Mr.
<HI>Dubourg</HI>'s. I found my&s;elf &s;o ill, that I could not go to Church;
however, about Two o'Clock, I went to dine with my Friends, who looked on me
with as much Surprize as if they had &s;een an Ap|parition. They had no
&s;ooner &s;eated me, but they both went out of the Room, and held a long
Con&s;ultation at the Door: Little did I think how deeply I was con|cerned in
it. At length Mrs. <HI>Dubourg</HI> came in: I tenderly reproached her with her
Coldne&s;s to me: She &s;aid, &s;he was not well; and a&s;ked me, had I heard
from <HI>Mole&s;worth-&s;treet</HI> that Day? I told her, I had not. She
a&s;ked me, if Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> would come to Dinner? I told her, he was
engaged to preach at <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s Church in the Afternoon, and
therefore went to Mrs. <HI>Warren</HI>'s, where they dined early. 
<PB N="184" REF="191"> A little while after, Coun&s;ellor <HI>Smith</HI> came
in; but they called him out, and held a long Conference with him. In &s;hort,
every body behaved them&s;elves &s;o oddly to me, that I knew not what to make
of it.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as Dinner was &s;erved up, Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> came in: 
<Q REND="inline">'My Dear (&s;aid I) you are bet|ter than
Promi&s;e.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why (&s;ays he) I am not come to dine, but to
tell you your Father is &s;tabbed.'</Q> Had he plunged a Dagger in my Heart, it
could not have given me a deeper Wound.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, this Accident, for &s;uch my Fa|ther declared it to
be, happened at Nine o'Clock in the Morning; and &s;o unkind were my Mother and
Si&s;ter, they never &s;ent me the lea&s;t Notice of it. The Company I went to,
had known of it &s;ome Hours before; and con&s;equently were &s;urprized to
find me ignorant of what &s;o nearly concerned me, and what, by that Time, all
<HI>Dublin</HI> knew. None of them could find in their Hearts to tell me of it;
and this was the Occa&s;ion of the many Con&s;ultations they held, which had
appeared &s;o &s;trange to me. It would be tedious to my Readers, to relate
every <PB N="185" REF="192"> Difficulty I had even to &s;ee my Father. In
re&s;pect to the A&s;hes of my Mother, I do not chu&s;e to tell how ill I was
u&s;ed upon this Occa&s;ion; but as I owe no &s;ort of Re|&s;pect or Ceremony
to my Si&s;ter, (if I may call her one, who by no means de&s;erves that Title)
I mu&s;t proceed. I ro&s;e from the Table, had a Chair called, and went to my
Father's: Three of the Servants &s;at in the Hall, and my Si&s;ter,
exce&s;&s;ively dirty, walked to and fro in it. She would wil|lingly have kept
me out; but however, the Servant knowing me, opened the Door. The fir&s;t
Noi&s;e which &s;truck my Ear, upon my Entrance, was the deep and piercing
Groans of my dear Father. When I at|tempted to go up Stairs to offer my Duty to
him, my Si&s;ter by Violence pulled me down; but the Agony I was in for my
Fa|ther, and the Re&s;entment I conceived at her gro&s;s U&s;age of me,
&s;upplied me with Strength to get up in de&s;pight of her. When I opened the
Dining-room Door, the Floor was all be&s;meared with Blood; my Mother, in an
arbitrary Voice, a&s;ked me, what Bu&s;ine&s;s I had there? I told her, 
<PB N="186" REF="193"> I had a Child's Right to pay my Duty to my Father. She
&s;aid, if I &s;poke to him it would kill him. Upon which, for the fir&s;t, and
indeed the only Time that ever I gave her an impertinent An&s;wer; I &s;aid,
that if every Per&s;on about my Father had loved him with half my Tenderne&s;s,
he would not have been reduced to the Con|dition I was then too &s;ure he was
in. Upon this, I offered to go into the Bed-chamber, but was not only forcibly
with&s;tood, but even beaten by my Mother, and again a&s;ked, if I intended to
kill my Father? I made her no Reply but &s;at down, and a&s;|&s;ured her, that
the fir&s;t Per&s;on who opened that Door I would go in. In about three Minutes
time Dr. <HI>Cope,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hel&s;ham,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nicholls,</HI> and in
all &s;even Phy&s;icians and three Surgeons (as my Father was univer|&s;ally
e&s;teemed) came of their own Accord to vi&s;it him; when I heard them on the
Stairs, I took that Opportunity to open the Bed-chamber Door, in which neither
my Mother nor my Si&s;ter could well op|po&s;e me, as the Gentlemen were come
into the Dining-room, before they were appri&s;ed <PB N="187" REF="194"> of my
Intention; but, Heavens! how &s;hall I de&s;cribe the Agony that &s;eized me,
when I beheld my dear Father pale as Death, and unable to utter any thing but
Groans? tho&s;e only who have loved a Father as well as I did mine, can judge
of my Condition: I kneeled down by the Bed&s;ide: Weak as he was he kindly
reached out his Hand to me: He a&s;bed me if this was not an un|happy Accident.
I begged he would not &s;peak, becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Nicholls</HI> had told me, his
Lungs were wounded, and that every Word was detrimental to him; but as I had
not ever knowingly offended him, I begged he would give me leave to pay my Duty
to him, and that he would &s;ignify it, by laying his Hand on my Head, which he
not only did, but de&s;ired I would not leave him. But here my Father gave me
an impo&s;&s;ible Ta&s;k; for no &s;ooner were the Gentlemen departed, but my
Mother &s;aid &s;he mu&s;t &s;peak with me; and whether &s;he was really mad,
or counterfeited to be &s;o, I know not; but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on my going to
Bed with her, alledging that my Si&s;ter was younger and &s;tronger than I, 
<PB N="188" REF="195"> and better able to bear the Fatigue of &s;itting up.
This &s;eemed to carry the Appearance of Love and Tenderne&s;s; but Heaven
knows it was far otherwi&s;e, as I afterwards found out; for the three
following Days my Mother never permitted me to leave her; if I ever attempted
it, &s;he tore her Hair, and &s;creamed like a Lunatick. The fourth Night I
heard my Father ring a Bell, my Mother was a&s;leep, and as my Thoughts were
ever on him, I ran down Stairs to him undre&s;t as I was. He &s;eemed
&s;urprized to &s;ee me, having been told that I was in my own Hou&s;e, and
would not un|dertake the Trouble of attending him. I found him in a very cold
Sweat; it &s;ud|denly came into my Head, that if I could change that into a hot
one, it might, per|haps, relieve him. So after a&s;&s;uring him, that I had not
quitted him, nor had ever been out of the Hou&s;e, but was prevented by my
Mother and Si&s;ter from attending on him, he &s;aid he was very dry, and
a&s;ked me, what the Phy&s;icians had ordered for him to drink. As they all
concluded he would not out-live that Night, they had ordered 
<PB N="189" REF="196"> nothing, but left him to take what he plea&s;ed, as, in
&s;pight of all Precautions to the contrary, I had overheard. Upon this, I
re&s;olved &s;o far to turn Phy&s;ician my&s;elf as to tell him, they ordered
him to drink &s;ome Hock and Sack made warm. Weak as he was he could not
forbear &s;miling, and &s;aying, he never heard of &s;uch another
Pre&s;cription; 
<Q REND="inline">'Ten Gentlemen meet to order me &s;ome Hock and
Sack mixed! &s;aid he; well, give it me: it mu&s;t certainly be a Cure for a
pleuretick Fever.'</Q> I did &s;o; nay, I not only gave it to him that Time,
but plied him with it every Time he called for Drink all Night, till it
produced the Effect I de&s;ired, and threw him into a fine breathing Sweat, and
a deep Sleep. It may now be demanded, where my Si&s;ter was all this Time? why,
as &s;he had not, if I may &s;peak my Mind, half the Regard for my Father that
I had, &s;he was fa&s;t a&s;leep in the Arm-Chair, nor could he awake her.</P>
<P>When the Phy&s;icians came in the Morn|ing, they were agreeably
&s;urprized to find my Father's Fever quite gone, and his Eyes 
<PB N="190" REF="197"> look very lively; he told them, their merry
Pre&s;cription had done him gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">rvice. I winked at them not to
undeceive him; they under&s;tood me, and Dr. <HI>Hel&s;ham</HI> called me
a&s;ide, under Pretence of giving me &s;ome Directions, but in reality, to
en|quire of me what I had admini&s;tered. I told him, and he could not forbear
&s;miling. He called the Gentlemen into the next Room to a Con&s;ultation, to
which pre&s;ent|ly after I was &s;ummoned. As both Dr. <HI>Hel|&s;ham</HI> and
Dr. <HI>Cope</HI> were Men of Wit and Plea&s;antry, they rallied me agreeably
on pre&s;uming to practi&s;e Phy&s;ick, having never taken my Degrees; and
a&s;&s;ured me I &s;hould be called before the College of Phy&s;icians, and be
pro&s;ecuted as an Empyrick.</P>
<P>I ro&s;e up, and making a low Courte&s;y, I told them, as the
be&s;t Part of the College of Phy&s;icians were then pre&s;ent, they would, I
hoped, have Candour enough to permit me to make my own Defence; to which they
all a&s;&s;ented by a gracious Nod, and bade me proceed; I then, making another
Reverence, told them, that as to my Right of practi&s;ing Phy&s;ick, I held it
<HI>extra ju|dice,</HI> <PB N="191" REF="198"> and &s;miling &s;aid, I
&s;uppo&s;ed they all under&s;tood <HI>Latin</HI>&mdash;but as their proper
Bu&s;ine&s;s was to de&s;troy Life, I hoped they would not take it ami&s;s, if
I for once, in a Ca&s;e which &s;o nearly and deeply concern|ed me, had, to the
utmo&s;t of my power, fru&s;trated their De&s;igns; neither had I pre|&s;umed
to interfere, till they them&s;elves had a&s;&s;ured me all Hope of my Father's
Life was gone, and that he could not live till Morning. But, &s;aid I, making
another Courte&s;y, I, with all re&s;pect to this ho|nourable Board, humbly
pre&s;ume to believe, 
<Q> 
<L>They had rather chu&s;e that he &s;hould die,</L> 
<L>Than their Prediction prove a Lye.</L></Q> Nothing, except my
Father's being &s;o very weak, and &s;o very near to us, could have prevented
the Gentlemen's laughing hearti|ly at my fine Harangue. However, I was
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with Honour; and as my Father &s;eemed now to want nothing but
Re&s;tora|tives, I was directed to make him &s;ome Viper Broth, Hart&s;horn
Jelly, Chocolate, and other nouri&s;hing Aliments.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="199">From this Time we entertained Hopes of my
Father's Recovery. In a few Days he was &s;o &s;trong as to be able to &s;it up
from Morning till Night. The whole Town &s;eemed to participate in our Joy; and
many who had never vi&s;ited him before, came now to congratulate him and his
Fa|mily on this happy Change. Whether it was owing to his having &s;een too
much Company, or to his own over-Neatne&s;s in in&s;i&s;ting on having his
Chamber cleaned, I know not; but I received a Me&s;&s;age from Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> that he was taken very ill, and de&s;ired to &s;ee me. As I
had flattered my&s;elf my Father was out of Danger, I obeyed the Commands of my
Hu&s;band, and prevailed on Mr. <HI>Nicholls</HI> to come to vi&s;it him. He
had got a Cold, and was a little feveri&s;h; Mr. <HI>Nicholls</HI> thought
pro|per to take a little Blood from him, and I &s;taid with him that Night and
Part of the en&s;uing Day. Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> being much relieved, gave me
leave in the Evening to go to my Father's, where I found all Things in
Confu&s;ion, and he &s;o ill that there was now not the lea&s;t Hope of his 
<PB N="193" REF="200"> Recovery: He coughed ince&s;&s;antly, was &s;eized with
what they call a galloping Con|&s;umption, and in a very few Days after
expired, leaving me in inconceivable Sor|row. About an Hour before he departed,
I left the Room being unable to &s;ee his la&s;t Agonies, and went up to my
Mother, who was as fa&s;t locked up in Sleep as guiltle&s;s Labour. Some time
after I heard the Windows thrown up, by which I knew his mortal Cares were
ended.</P>
<P>We had that Evening engaged a Nur&s;e Keeper, but did not dare to
let her into my Father's Pre&s;ence, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;ay, as he once did,
on propo&s;ing &s;uch a thing, that we were tired of him; but now her
A&s;&s;i&s;tance was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, tho' my Si&s;ter told me,
&s;he her&s;elf helped to wa&s;h and lay my Father out. I am &s;ure I could
have died &s;ooner; but &s;ome Per&s;ons have uncommon Courage, or rather, as
<HI>Swift</HI> ob&s;erves, 
<Q> 
<L>Indiff'rence clad in Wi&s;dom's Gui&s;e,</L> 
<L>All Fortitude of Mind &s;upplies.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="201">About three o'Clock in the Morning, on
New-Year's-Day, my Si&s;ter came into the Room, and de&s;ired me to come and
help her to take my Father up, that he wanted to ri&s;e. Tho' I was certain he
was dead, as I had not taken off my Cloaths, I went with her, and &s;ent in the
Maid to &s;it by my Mother. I a&s;ked my Si&s;ter on the Stairs, was my Father
alive? She an&s;wered, No. So with a heavy Heart I went into the Dining-Room;
but by no means could I &s;ummon up &s;ufficient Spirits, to look upon the
clay-cold Figure of him, who, under God, was the Author of my Being. My Heart
fluttered; my Tongue refu&s;ed it's Office; neither had I the poor Relief of
Tears&mdash;no Wonder, when <HI>the very Spring and Fountain of my Life was
&s;topt&mdash;the very Source of it was &s;topped,</HI> if the Streams thereon
dependant, were for a while froze up and dead.</P>
<P>While I was lo&s;t in melancholy-mu&s;ing, my Si&s;ter was very
indu&s;trious in making the Tea-Kettle boil. I do not &s;ay this by way of
Reflection on her; for tho' I was le&s;s a&s;&s;iduous about it, my own Mouth
was <PB N="195" REF="202"> perfectly parched with Thir&s;t, and I was very glad
of &s;omething to moi&s;ten it.</P>
<P>When the Tea was ready, unluckily we had no Sugar, nor was there
any in the Hou&s;e, but what was in the Tea-Che&s;t, the Key of which was in my
Mother's Pocket under her Head. My Si&s;ter went up and waked her, telling her,
my Father wanted a little burned Wine. She readily gave it, and prayed devoutly
that it might do him good. My Si&s;ter came down laughing, to think how &s;he
had impo&s;ed on her. If any thing could have added Weight to the intolerable
Burthen of my Sorrows, I now felt it, by con&s;idering how terrible my Mother's
Surprize and Di&s;appointment mu&s;t be!</P>
<P>About &s;ix o'Clock, I thought is was pro|per to &s;end the
Che&s;t of Plate into Dean <HI>Madden</HI>'s, and to lock up whatever was
valuable; a prudent Precaution, as it too &s;oon appeared. After this I went
into my Mother's Chamber; &s;he a&s;ked me how my Father was. I told her he had
been very ill in the Beginning of the Night, but was now very quiet. She
&s;aid, &s;he hoped Sleep <PB N="196" REF="203"> would do him good. I
an&s;wered, I tru&s;ted in God it had. So &s;he aro&s;e, and would not put on
her Shoes le&s;t &s;he &s;hould di&s;turb him: Nay, &s;o &s;trong was the Force
of her Imagination, that &s;he even &s;aid, &s;he heard him cough as we
pa&s;&s;ed by his Chamber Door: But a &s;ad Counterfeit was I; for when we came
into his Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, which opened to the Garden, as it was now
Day-light, my Mother ea&s;ily perceived the Concern in my Countenance; &s;he
&s;hrieked when &s;he looked at me, and with great Impatience a&s;ked me, what
ailed me: 
<Q REND="inline">'O Lord! cried &s;he, cannot you give me one Word
of Comfort?'</Q> I an&s;wered very faintly, I wi&s;hed it was in my Power: But
alas! her wor&s;t Fears were but too true; all was over. I really thought &s;he
would now have run quite mad; &s;carcely could I prevent her going into his
Chamber. I &s;ent in for Dean <HI>Madden,</HI> who by Prayers and &s;piritual
Advice, a little calmed her; but one Woe trod upon the other's Heels: Mr.
<HI>Nicholls,</HI> who for the particular Re|gard he had for my Father, was his
fir&s;t Vi&s;itor, and who&s;e Humanity during the <PB N="197" REF="204"> whole
Time of his Sickne&s;s, de&s;erves a grateful Acknowledgment; which, if the
&s;urviving Part of his Family refu&s;e, I think it incumbent on me to pay,
&s;o far at lea&s;t as Words can do it, came into the Dining-Room; he
gue&s;&s;ed our Lo&s;s 'ere we could &s;peak it, and &s;eemed to bear a Part in
our Sorrows. He a&s;ked me what Hour he &s;hould come to open my Father. I told
him, he had left his Cur&s;e on any Per&s;on who attempted it. He &s;aid he was
very glad of it; for as this di&s;mal Operation mu&s;t have fallen to his
Share, it would, I am certain, greatly have &s;hocked his Hu|manity. I would
have had him go up to &s;ee my Mother: He &s;aid it would but re|new her
Trouble, and that when &s;he was a little more calm he would make her a
Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>I now thought it highly nece&s;&s;ary to per|&s;uade my poor
Mother to take, at lea&s;t, a Di&s;h of Tea, which I could not do, but by
a&s;&s;uring her I was ready to faint. Ju&s;t as it was prepared, a Servant,
looking like a Gho&s;t, opened the Door, and beckoned me to follow him; I did
&s;o, and upon com|ing <PB N="198" REF="205"> down Stairs, found the Hou&s;e
filled with Sheriff's Officers: One of them, who&s;e Name was
<HI>Williams,</HI> was mo&s;t remarkably in&s;olent, and abu&s;ed me very
gro&s;ly. I once more &s;ent in for Dean <HI>Madden</HI>; I believe the worthy
Gentleman thought his Words might prevail, but the Scoundrel <HI>Williams</HI>
bade him, go talk in his Pulpit. However, I had Pre&s;ence of Mind
&s;uffi|cient to write a Line to Coun&s;ellor <HI>Smith</HI>; he happened not
to be at home; &s;o I begged of the Dean to go to my Mother, lea&s;t tho&s;e
licen&s;ed Robbers &s;hould plunder the Hou&s;e. About &s;even in the Evening
Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> came; he found the Wretches very bu&s;y in taking an
Inventory of the Furni|ture. They were full as rude to him, as they had been to
the Dean; and at la&s;t car|ried it &s;o far, as to in&s;i&s;t upon arre&s;ting
my Father's Body, ju&s;t then laid in a Coffin. I, almo&s;t wild with Grief,
ran after them; the Coffin was open, and I rai&s;ed my dear Father in my Arms,
and, as if he could have heard me, a&s;ked him, Would he not protect his
Family? Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> had, in the mean Time, &s;ent for the High-Sheriff;
he <PB N="199" REF="206"> was a young, good-natured Gentleman; and, after
heartily reprimanding the Fellows, nay, and even making <HI>Williams</HI> beg
pardon on his Knees, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them all, except one, whom he ordered, not
only to be civil, but al&s;o to do the Work of a Ser|vant; a&s;&s;uring us, he
would take an In|ventory of the Things him&s;elf, as &s;oon as the Funeral was
over.</P>
<P>The next Day, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> we deter|mined to have my
dear Father buried, ac|cording to his own Directions, privately, at Twelve
o'Clock at Night; and I ea&s;ily prevailed on Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> and his
pre&s;ent Lady, to give their Company to my Mother, during the Time of this
la&s;t &s;ad &s;olemn Ceremony. As my Mother wept in|ce&s;&s;antly, it made her
&s;leepy; but the Noi&s;e made in carrying down my Father's Corp&s;e, awak'd
her; and as &s;he had only &s;lumber'd in her Chair, &s;he &s;tarted up, crying
out, they were carrying her dear Hu&s;band to the Grave, and that &s;he would
go and be buried with him. We were obliged by Violence to re&s;train her; nay,
and al&s;o to a&s;&s;ure her he had been interred <PB N="200" REF="207"> &s;ome
Hours, and that the Noi&s;e &s;he heard was only that of the Servants, who were
&s;etting Things in Order. Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> and his Lady, who, according to
their Promi&s;e, came and pa&s;&s;ed the Evening with my Mo|ther, &s;aid every
thing that Rea&s;on, Chri&s;ti|anity, or Humanity could dictate, to miti|gate
her Afflictions. Gratitude for their Kindne&s;s made her endeavour to
&s;upre&s;s the Angui&s;h of her Soul; nay, out of Complai&s;ance to them,
&s;he drank a Gla&s;s or two of Wine, which, as &s;he had not done for &s;ome
Weeks before, produced the Effect I de&s;ired, of making her &s;leep. Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> attended the Funeral Ob&s;e|quies, which was the only Proof
of Re|&s;pect or Kindne&s;s he ever &s;hewed to the Fa|mily.</P>
<P>Early the next Morning, I ro&s;e; and if, in the melancholy
Situation of my Soul, any thing could have made me &s;mile, the Cookmaid's
Simplicity would certainly have done it; for, finding her Fire made, her
Di&s;hes wa&s;hed, and every thing &s;et in good Order, &s;o well did the
Bailiff, who was left in the Hou&s;e, obey the High Sheriff's 
<PB N="201" REF="208"> Orders, in doing the Work of a Servant; and he having
walked into the Garden; the Maid not recollecting there was any &s;uch Per&s;on
in the Hou&s;e, &s;tood cro&s;&s;ing her&s;elf, and praying to the Ble&s;&s;ed
Virgin, and all the Saints in Heaven. I a&s;ked her, What was the matter? 
<Q REND="inline">'O my dear Ma|dam! (&s;ays &s;he) my Ma&s;ter was
always neat; and &s;ee, for all he is dead, how he made the Fire, and cleaned
up the Kitchen for me.'</Q></P>
<P>I left the poor Girl in her Mi&s;take, and went up to my Mother.
It grieved me to awake her; yet knowing the High Sheriff would be early with
us, and that the In|ventory of what was in her Chamber mu&s;t be taken, I
thought it was mo&s;t decent for her to be up, as her unhappy Situation could
not authorize her taking on the State of a Lady of Quality, to lie in Bed a
Month for Fa&s;hion's-&s;ake.</P>
<P>She was not long up before the Gentle|man came: From him I
learned, that this Execution was laid at the Suit of the Wi|dow <HI>Ford,</HI>
who being Executrix to her Children, had a&s;ked my Father, where &s;he 
<PB N="202" REF="209"> could lay out their Money to Advantage. As Mr.
<HI>Monck</HI> wanted Money, my Father immediately thought of him; but as his
E&s;tate was not liable to his Debts, my Father became Surety for him. This was
enough for me; I immediately wrote to Mr. <HI>Monck</HI>; who, on Receipt of
the Letter, came to Town, and, with great Honour, not only di&s;charged his own
Debt, but al&s;o paid the Sheriff's Fees, which in three Days amount|ed to
Twenty Pounds.</P>
<P>This Gentleman was the late <HI>Henry Stanly Monck,</HI> of
<HI>St. Stephen's Green.</HI></P>
<P>My Si&s;ter, like all provident Per&s;ons, made the be&s;t of her
Way to her Hu&s;band's Mother; who being a&s;&s;ured, by Dean <HI>Mad|den,</HI>
that he him&s;elf had married my Si&s;ter to her Son, which had been
que&s;tioned, on Account of his abrupt Departure from her, &s;oon after he had
made her a Mother, was &s;o kindly received by her new Parent, that for three
Weeks after, &s;he never either &s;ent, or came, to know what was become of the
old one.</P>
<P>As my Father had po&s;itively prohibited us from writing any
Account to my Bro|ther, <PB N="203" REF="210"> then at <HI>Paris,</HI> of the
Misfortune that had befallen him, I thought it not proper to di&s;obey him;
yet, at the &s;ame time, judged it highly nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be
ap|prized of the melancholy Situation of his Affairs at home; I therefore
engaged a young Gentleman, an intimate Friend of my Brother's, to undertake the
mournful Ta&s;k, and advi&s;e him immediately to re|turn to <HI>Ireland:</HI>
But his be&s;t Speed could not overtake his Father's Life, who had been three
Weeks buried e're he arrived. When he &s;aw us in deep Mourning, and mi&s;&s;ed
the dear Parent, who u&s;ed ever to receive him with the Love of a Father, and
the Freedom of a Companion, all his Re&s;olution could &s;carce &s;upport it:
and tho' he endeavoured to comfort us, 'twas but too vi&s;ible he wanted it
him&s;elf. My Heart bled for him; &s;o di&s;appointed in all his Hopes, which,
as they had been high rai&s;ed, were now the more depre&s;&s;ed. In &s;hort, we
were all mere Out&s;ide, each endeavouring, by a forced Chearfulne&s;s, to
conceal their inward Angui&s;h from each other.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="211">As my Brother, &s;oon after, &s;old off the
Goods by Auction, and placed my Mother, who was left entirely dependant on him,
to board at a Clergyman's Hou&s;e in the Coun|try, after which I never &s;aw
her more; I returned to my own Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> having now no Expecta|tion of a Fortune by
me, he threw off all Di&s;gui&s;e, and &s;hewed him&s;elf in his proper
Colours; he had, it &s;eems, while I was in the Country, in a bad State of
Health, got in League with the Widow <HI>W&mdash;rr&mdash;n,</HI> whom he
intended, if I had died, as was expected, &s;hould &s;upply my Place. How|ever,
he was re&s;olved to gid rid of me at any rate; and as nothing but my Death, or
a Divorce, could accompli&s;h his De&s;ires, the latter &s;eemed the &s;afer
Method. To this End, he &s;et all his Engines to work. His fir&s;t Scheme I
&s;hall here relate.</P>
<P>One Morning pretty early, he &s;ent for me to come to him to
Breakfa&s;t in the Summer-hou&s;e; as I thought he was alone, I ran to him
quite undre&s;t; but was con|founded at the Sight of a Gentleman, whom I had
never &s;een before, and who was dre&s;t <PB N="205" REF="212"> out with the
utmo&s;t Magnificence and Cu|rio&s;ity, rather in the Habit of a Birth-Night
Beau, than a Morning Vi&s;itor. I was for retiring, but Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>
obliged me to come in, and introduced him to me. I &s;at down with the be&s;t
Grace I could; and made the Tea: Before it was half over Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>
&s;aid, he was obliged to go vi&s;it a &s;ick Per&s;on; but that he &s;hould
re|turn in half an Hour, engaging me not to let the Gentleman go till then; at
the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring him, I was very well qualified to entertain him
agreeably. The Gentle|man did not expre&s;s the lea&s;t Reluctance at complying
with his Reque&s;t; &s;o far from it, that as &s;oon as he was gone, he &s;aid,
he was much indebted to Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s Complai&s;ance, for the
favourable Oppor|tunity he had afforded him of &s;peaking his Wi&s;hes; and,
laying hold of my Hand, he began to addre&s;s me in a mo&s;t bom|ba&s;tic
Stile, with Fu&s;tian from exploded Plays. For my part, I thought he was mad,
and growing angry at what I deemed a great Incivility to a married Woman, I
a&s;&s;ured him, if he per&s;i&s;ted in &s;uch Imper|tinence, 
<PB N="206" REF="213"> I would quit the Place. He then begged Pardon mo&s;t
humbly indeed, for he threw him&s;elf on the Carpet at my Feet, &s;wearing he
would never ri&s;e till I had forgiven him; which, not to be plagued with his
farther Impertinence, I was forced to &s;ay, I did. He then wanted me to
confirm it by a Ki&s;s, but that I would by no means grant. In &s;hort, his
Company was &s;o tire&s;ome, that I mo&s;t im|patiently longed for a Relea&s;e;
which, however, Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> was re&s;olved not to give me: So
finding the Gentleman was determined to pro&s;ecute me, I told him I was
engaged to dine abroad, and hoped he would excu&s;e my leaving him, as I
ex|pected a Lady to call upon me, which laid me under a Nece&s;&s;ity of going
to dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon this civil Di&s;mi&s;s, to my great Sa|tisfaction he took his
Leave, promi&s;ing me, he would do him&s;elf the Honour of waiting on me again
very &s;peedily, to which I made no Reply.</P>
<P>I believe he went to Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> to give him an Account
of what had pa&s;t, <PB N="207" REF="214"> who &s;ome time after returned, and
&s;eemed much offended, that I had &s;uffered his Friend, as he called him, to
go away; add|ing, that he was related to the Duke of <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> and
might, by his Intere&s;t, get him a good Living. I an&s;wered, Let him be ever
&s;o well related, he was a very trouble&s;ome Coxcomb, and if he liked &s;uch
Company, I did not.</P>
<P>A few Days after my younge&s;t Child died, and that I might avoid
&s;eeing the Funeral, I retired to the Summer-Hou&s;e, where I &s;at weeping;
when &s;uddently this &s;ame fine Spark opened the Door. He told me, Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> had &s;ent him to de&s;ire I would have &s;ome Coffee ready,
and that he would be at home immediately. I de&s;ired the Gentleman to go with
me to the Dwelling-Hou&s;e, not chu&s;ing to &s;tay alone with him at &s;o
great a Di&s;tance from every Body. The Coffee was prepared, but no Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> came, &s;o we drank it without him, and the Gentleman fell
into his old Vagaries again. I then, 
<Q><PB N="208" REF="215"> 
<L>All &s;marting with my Griefs, being vex'd</L> 
<L>To be &s;o pe&s;tered by a Popinjay,</L> 
<BIBL>Shake&s;pear.</BIBL></Q> Bur&s;t into Tears, and demanded
of him, what he meant by &s;uch In&s;olence? He looked v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">y much confounded, and a&s;ked me, was I in earne&s;t? I
a&s;&s;ured him I was, and that I would acquaint Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> with
his Rudene&s;s. He &s;miled at that Threat, and to my great Surprize, made me
the following Speech. 
<Q REND="inline">'Madam, I am convinced by your Behaviour, that you
are a Woman of Honour, and am very &s;orry I &s;hould be &s;o unfortunate as to
provoke your Tears: The be&s;t Re|compence I can make you, is, to entru&s;t you
with a Secret; and I doubt not but you will have Di&s;cretion enough to make a
proper u&s;e of it. Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> de|&s;cribed you to me, as a Lady
very li|beral of your Favours, and begged I would be &s;o kind as to make him a
Cuckold, &s;o that he might be able to prove it, in order to a Separation from 
<PB N="209" REF="216"> you; promi&s;ing to give me Time and Opportunity for it:
He a&s;&s;ured me, it would be no difficult Ta&s;k; that I need but throw
my&s;elf at your Feet, whine out &s;ome Tragedy, and you would quick|ly yield.
But I am now convinced, that he is a very great V&mdash;n, and very un|worthy
of you.'</Q></P>
<P>I leave my Rea&s;on to judge of my A&s;to|ni&s;hment. I could
&s;carce give the Gentle|man Credit; and yet it was but too evident that he
&s;poke Truth, as it was now nine o'Clock at Night, and Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>
not come home to his invited Gue&s;t.</P>
<P>When I had recovered Power to &s;peak, I told him, I &s;uppo&s;ed
Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> knew him to be a Per&s;on de&s;titute of all Honour and
Humanity, when he propo&s;ed &s;uch a Scheme to him as that of betraying any
Woman. 
<Q REND="inline">'Faith, Madam, returned he, I never intended it;
for had you made me happy, I would, like a Gentleman, have for&s;worn it, and
al&s;o have given you a proper Caution: But I would not pay you &s;o ill a
Compliment, as not to a&s;&s;ure you, the Bait was very illuring. 
<PB N="210" REF="217"> I believe there are very few young Fel|lows who would
have refu&s;ed him the Favour he de&s;ired of me.'</Q> I then beg|ged he would
be &s;o kind to leave me, which, accordingly, taking his Leave very
re&s;pectfully, he did.</P>
<P>I went to Bed full of Di&s;quietude; but the bitter Angui&s;h of
my Soul quite bani&s;h|ed Sleep. I con&s;idered the Snares were laid for me,
and that he who ought to be the Guardian and Protector of my In|nocence, was
the very fir&s;t Per&s;on who &s;ought to de&s;troy it. I wept abundantly, and
prayed heartily to God, to deliver me out of my Trouble; at length I fell into
a Slumber, when methought my Father, ju&s;t as I had &s;een him in his Coffin,
drew open the Curtain, and muttered &s;omething to me very low and
indi&s;tinct; but the Words <HI>Trouble, Sorrow</HI> and <HI>Shame,</HI> I very
plainly heard. I &s;tarted up, and turned the Head Curtain back; but &s;eeing
nothing, con|cluded the Trouble of my Mind produced &s;uch terrifying Dreams,
and recommend|ing my&s;elf to Heaven, once more addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to
Sleep; when &s;uddenly, me|thought, <PB N="211" REF="218"> I was in the mid&s;t
of a Parcel of Ruffians who were fighting, and that I, though I knew not why,
was the Occa&s;ion of their Quarrel. At la&s;t I thought one of them gave me a
&s;evere Blow over the Head, at which I &s;creamed out, and Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> who was now in the Chamber, waked me, and a&s;ked me, what
was the matter? I told him, I had a very &s;hocking Dream. 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, &s;ays he, you grieve &s;o much after your
Father, and your Brat, and take no Su&s;tenance, that it is no Wonder you

revived me. I then told him Mr. <HI>H&mdash;d</HI> had been to &s;ee him. He
a&s;ked me, how long he &s;tayed? I an&s;wered, till I was weary of him. 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, did he offend you?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed (returned I) he did.'</Q>

<P>In the mean time the Pari&s;h was quite in an Uproar; nobody to
vi&s;it the Sick, or read Six o'Clock Prayers. I related this Part of my
Di&s;tre&s;s to my Brother, who prevailed on a young Gentleman, who had been
his School-fellow and Companion, then newly ordained, to do Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s Duty.</P>
<P>As for my two Children, I &s;ent them to School, and they dined
every Day with Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s Father; the Servants were forced to run
in Debt for Provi&s;ion; and, for my own part, I quartered my&s;elf on my next
Door Neighbours, Mr. <HI>Lind&s;ay</HI> and his Spou&s;e, where I always met a
chear|ful and friendly Reception.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="221">I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that becau&s;e I
loved reading, Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> took with him the Key of his Study, into
which he had re|moved all my Books, Pre&s;ents to me from my Friends before I
was married. He al&s;o locked up the Garden, rather chu&s;ing it &s;hould be
overgrown with Weeds, and the Plants and Flowers die for Want of Water, than
that either I or the Children &s;hould have the Plea&s;ure of amu&s;ing
our|&s;elves in it. The Tea-che&s;t was al&s;o &s;e|cured; &s;o I was left like
a tame Cat, with the Liberty of walking about through two or three empty
Rooms.</P>
<P>When I had learned where Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> was, I wrote to
him; but received no An&s;wer. At length, one <HI>Saturday,</HI> about Twelve
o'Clock at Noon, his Hor&s;e was brought home and a mangy Dog, of which I was
ordered to take a particular care, which I did; and now expected the Ma&s;|ter.
But as his buxom old Widow (and old enough &s;he was to be my Mother, and big
enough to make four of me) came to Town with him, he &s;tayed with her till
Twelve o'Clock at Night. His fir&s;t Que&s;|tion <PB N="215" REF="222"> when he
entered was, where was his Dog? with which having played about half an Hour,
hugging, ki&s;&s;ing, and calling it an Angel, he at la&s;t vouch&s;afed to
come up Stairs. I &s;at in my Clo&s;et in a very pen&s;ive Po&s;ture; his
fir&s;t Salutation to me was, to a&s;k me, how I had the Impudence to write to
him about my Family Affairs? I a&s;ked him to whom el&s;e &s;hould I write? 
<Q REND="inline">'Very fine! (returned he) &s;uppo&s;e Mrs.

<P>I believe he thought he had now gone too far, and was more than
half afraid I would publi&s;h all his Villanies; &s;o he fell into his old
Trade of Di&s;&s;imulation, in which he is a perfect Ma&s;ter; and taking me by
the Hand, told me, he did not <PB N="216" REF="223"> think &s;o gentle a Temper
as mine could be di&s;turbed at any Thing; and that it was very unkind in me to
be di&s;obliged at his taking a little Recreation in the Country; adding, that
he often wi&s;hed for me there. I a&s;ked him why he did not take me with him?
He &s;aid, he had propo&s;ed it to Mrs. <HI>W&mdash;rr&mdash;n</HI>; but that
&s;he had objected a|gain&s;t it, telling him, I was a Woman of &s;o bad a
Reputation, that &s;he would not for all the World countenance me. I mu&s;t beg
leave to a&s;k my Readers, what Sort of Terms this Couple mu&s;t be on, when
&s;he took the Liberty of traducing his Wife to him? She may be very cha&s;te,
for aught I know; but I verily believe many an un|happy Creature, who has even
pro&s;tituted her&s;elf for Bread, would not have been guilty of her Crime.</P>
<P><HI>Cur&s;ed be he that parteth Man and Wife</HI> is Part of our
<HI>A&s;h-Wedne&s;day</HI> Service, to which I &s;ay <HI>Amen,</HI> with all my
Heart and Soul.</P>
<P>But to return: I told Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> I was extremely
obliged to the Lady; that mo&s;t Men, even if they hated their Wives, 
<PB N="217" REF="224"> would re&s;ent any Injury offered to them as being Part
of them&s;elves; but he was too good a Chri&s;tian for that. So I aro&s;e, and
was for leaving the Room. He a&s;ked me, where I was going? I an&s;wered, 
<Q REND="inline">'To &s;leep with my Children; for why &s;hould I,
Sir, go to bed to a Man, in who&s;e Per&s;on, Mind, or Fortune, I have no
longer a Share; and who has actually divorced him|&s;elf from me, as the Law
can do!'</Q></P>
<P>However he in&s;i&s;ted on my &s;taying with him, which
accordingly I did. We both ro&s;e pretty early; and the Children coming in to
a&s;k his Ble&s;&s;ing, he whipt his Daugh|ter &s;everely, becau&s;e, as he
&s;aid, &s;he re|&s;embled my Mother; though indeed &s;he was infinitely more
like his own: And, to &s;hew his Impartiality, he whipt the poor little Boy,
for being like him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When this Scene was over, the Children were turned down to the
Kitchen, and the mangy Dog, which it &s;eems was given him by Mrs.
<HI>W&mdash;rr&mdash;n,</HI> invited to a good Plate of Toa&s;t and Butter and
half a Pint of Cream for his Breakfa&s;t; &s;o well did he 
<PB N="218" REF="225"> fulfil the old Proverb, <HI>Love me, love my
Dog.</HI></P>
<P>After the&s;e Holy Exerci&s;es, he went to the Communion; which
indeed I had in|tended to do, but as he had really vexed me pa&s;t my Patience,
I could not compo&s;e my|&s;elf &s;ufficiently for the worthily receiving
tho&s;e &s;ublime My&s;teries.</P>
<P>Thus we may &s;ee it is in the power of a bad Man, not only to
de&s;troy our temporal, but al&s;o our eternal Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;aw no more of him till Midnight; buxom <HI>Joan</HI> engaging
him till then, or in other Words, the Widow <HI>W&mdash;rr&mdash;n.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s Father hearing he was in Town, came the
next Morning to &s;ee him, and demanded of him the Money he had paid for his
Childrens Tuition; upon which he turned to me, with an Air of great Con|tempt,
and told me, he thought when he had married &s;o accompli&s;hed a Lady, &s;he
might have taught her Children to read, write, work, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and at
lea&s;t have &s;aved him the Expence of their Education. I told him, and indeed
it was Truth, that I &s;hould never de&s;ire a more delightful Em|ployment 
<PB N="219" REF="226"> than that of cultivating their Minds; but that he ought
to con&s;ider, he left no Support for our Bodies, and con&s;e|quently I was
obliged to go abroad every Day to &s;eek for Food, and could not en|cumber
&s;uch Company, as I might be wel|come to, with my Children. Here Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s Father interrupted me, by &s;ay|ing, I might always have
been welcome to him. Indeed I doubt it not, for he was a good-natured Man; but
as he kept an Ale|hou&s;e, it was no very agreeable Place for me to pa&s;s my
Time in.</P>
<P>Next Morning buxom <HI>Joan</HI> came in her own Coach for her
Chaplain; a Right which mo&s;t Widows of Fortune claim. I looked at her, and
&s;he hid her Face. Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> &s;oon waited on her, and away they
went together, leaving me ju&s;t as de|&s;olate as I was before.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> has often alledged, in order to prove me an
Adultre&s;s, as I was with Child when we parted, that he had no manner of
matrimonial Commerce with me for four Years. I was but ju&s;t four and twenty
Years of Age when we were &s;epa|rated; <PB N="220" REF="227"> and, as my
Reader may ob&s;erve, he would not permit me to have a &s;eparate Bed, whether
what he not only &s;aid, but &s;wore, was true or fal&s;e, I do not &s;ee how
he could gain any Honour by it.</P>
<P>For as the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Friar &s;ays, when old

<Q> 
<L>A fine Commendation truly!</L> 
<L>The Church did not put you together for that.</L></Q></P>
<P>And here, gentle Reader, give me leave to drop the Curtain. To
avouch mine own Innocence in a Point, where Appear|ances were &s;trong
again&s;t me, would per|haps little avail me: The &s;upreme Judge of Hearts
alone will at the la&s;t great Day clear or condemn me; to who&s;e unerring
Ju&s;tice and boundle&s;s Goodne&s;s I &s;ubmit my Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>When Snares and Limed-Twigs are &s;pread for a poor Bird, it

<P>I could reckon up numberle&s;s In&s;tances of Mr.

One Day, at Dinner, the Pin in the Robing of my Gown, pricked my Brea&s;t; as
there was no body but my Hu&s;band and Children pre&s;ent, I made no Scruple of
uncovering my Bo&s;om, to examine what had hurt me; upon which Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> ro&s;e from Table, and &s;aid I had turned his Stomach. As I
really had a fine Skin, and was then a mo&s;t remarkably neat Per&s;on, I
thought he only <PB N="222" REF="229"> je&s;ted; and merrily told him, he
&s;hould ki&s;s my Brea&s;t and make it well: But alas! it was not like
<HI>Prior</HI>'s <HI>Lover's Anger,</HI> where when the Lady complains, that 
<Q> 
<L>An ugly hard Ro&s;e-bud has fall'n in my Neck,</L> 
<L>It has vex'd me, and plagu'd me to &s;uch a Degree!</L> 
<L>Look here now; you'll never believe one, pray &s;ee,</L> 
<L>I' th' Left Side of my Brea&s;t what a Mark it has made!</L> 
<L>So &s;aying, her Bo&s;om &s;he carele&s;s di&s;play'd:</L> 
<L>That Seat of Delight I with Wonder &s;ur|vey'd,</L> 
<L>And forgot ev'ry Word I de&s;ign'd to have &s;aid.</L></Q> For
he told me, he was &s;ure he &s;hould faint if I came near him; and either
pretended to throw up his Dinner, or did it in reality. After which polite
Compliment, he drank a large Gla&s;s of Cherry-brandy, to &s;ettle his Stomach;
and repaired to his u&s;ual Haunt, <HI>i. e.</HI> to buxom <HI>Joan.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="230">About Twelve at Night, he returned, and
awaked me out of a &s;weet Sleep, by telling me, I was a mo&s;t expen&s;ive

<P>I beg leave here to remark, that my Hu&s;|band's Complaints were
very different from tho&s;e of mo&s;t married Men; their general Excu&s;e for
going a&s;tray is, that their Wives are dirty, &s;lothful, ignorant,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> the very Rever&s;e of which &s;wini&s;h Qualities made my good

Win|dow, who, though they might have open|ed the Chamber-Door, cho&s;e rather
to break it to pieces, and took the Gentleman and my&s;elf Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>For my own Part, I thought they had been Hou&s;e-breakers, and

Watchmen hold him, while he mo&s;t courageou&s;ly broke his Head.</P>
<P>After this heroic Action, he told me, who &s;tood quite
&s;tupified between Surprize and Pain, that I mu&s;t turn out of Doors; but
ob&s;erving that I was fainting, he brought up a Bottle of Wine, and kindly
drank both our Healths. He would fain have prevailed on us to pledge him; but
we were not in a Temper to return Civili|ty. Upon which he took my Hand, and
very generou&s;ly made a Pre&s;ent of me to the Gentleman, who could not in

procured on any other Terms. Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> kindly di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed our

<PB N="232" REF="239"> would with great Plea&s;ure, join us together in holy
Matrimony. At the Door the Gentleman's Sword was delivered to him. Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> offered to ki&s;s me at part|ing, which mean Piece of
Di&s;&s;imulation, &s;o much in the Stile of <HI>Jack Ketch,</HI> gave me the
utmo&s;t Contempt for the V&mdash;n.</P>
<P>It was by this time two o'Clock in the Morning, and we knew not
where to &s;teer our Cour&s;e: However, the Gentleman's Servant always &s;at up
for him, and there|fore he judged it more advi&s;eable to go to his own
Lodging, than to &s;earch for any other, and, truly, I little cared where I
went.</P>
<P>And here, I &s;incerely a&s;&s;ure my Reader, that neither of us
even entertained a Thought of any thing like Love, but &s;at like Statues till
Day-break; when recollect|ing that I had nothing to change me with, I wrote a
Letter to Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> to de&s;ire he would &s;end me my wearing
Apparel, or at lea&s;t &s;ome clean Linen.</P>
<P>He complied with my Reque&s;t, and wrote me a long Letter, wherein
he &s;eemingly ex|pre&s;&s;ed an infinite Concern for my Lo&s;s, but 
<PB N="233" REF="240"> as I had mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly recommended our Children
to his Care, he gave it then un|der his Hand that he was perfectly con|vinced
they were his own, and that I might depend on his Tenderne&s;s to them; but at
the &s;ame time, as he was determined to be legally divorced, he expected I
would not give him any Oppo&s;ition in it.</P>
<P>Before I received this Letter, I had taken a Lodging in
<HI>Abbey-&s;treet</HI> up two pair of Stairs, where my Clothes were brought to
me, together with it; but not a &s;ingle Shilling to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, my Watch,
my Books, and even what few Jewels I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed be|fore Marriage, were
detained from me, which threw me quite dependant on the Courte&s;y of the
Per&s;on I was accu&s;ed with.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> was &s;o highly pro|voked at our not
cohabiting together, as he wi&s;hed, that he forced the Gentleman to fly, who
having Notice that there was an Action taken out again&s;t him, made the be&s;t
of his way to <HI>London,</HI> leaving a Letter with five Guineas enclo&s;ed in
it for <PB N="234" REF="241"> me, in the Hands of a Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter,
who very faithfully di&s;charged his Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity made me go to the Gentle|man's Lodging to enquire of
his Land|lady what &s;he knew relating to him; the Gentlewoman was very
obliging, but could give me no Satisfaction or Light into the Affair: However,
&s;he made me drink Tea with her, and we &s;at together till near nine o'Clock
at Night.</P>
<P>At my return to my own Lodging, the Maid told me my Room was Let;
I &s;aid that was odd, as it was taken by the Week, and one not then expired,
to Let it with|out giving me Warning to provide my&s;elf, which, at that Hour,
in a Winter's Night, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to do.</P>
<P>The Maid, to who&s;e care this Hou&s;e was entru&s;ted, for I know
not who was Land|lord, told me, I might if I plea&s;ed lie in the fir&s;t
Floor, as the Family were not come to Town, and there were only their Servants
in the Hou&s;e, whom &s;he could di&s;po&s;e of into wor&s;e Beds; but, to my
great Surprize, I found the Lock had been taken off the Bed-chamber Door, which
I will remem|bered <PB N="235" REF="242"> had been on it in the Morning, as I
had &s;ome Difficulty to open it to take thence &s;ome China.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked her the meaning of it? She in|&s;i&s;ted po&s;itively
that there never had been a Lock on it, which knowing to be a Fal&s;hood, I
began to be apprehen&s;ive &s;ome foul play was intended, nor was I
mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>I then a&s;ked her for a young Woman, whom &s;he had told me was a
Servant out of Place, that lodged in the back Parlour; &s;he &s;aid &s;he was a
Bed in the Garret, and that my Trunk was there al&s;o; this gave me a
&s;ufficient Excu&s;e, as there was no Lock on the Trunk, to go up to her; and
as &s;he had been a Lady's Woman, and very well knew who I was, I told her all
my Appre|hen&s;ions, and &s;he readily con&s;ented to quit her own Bed and come
to mine.</P>
<P>We brought down the Trunk between us, and placed it again&s;t the
Chamber-Door; as the Maid was bu&s;ied with her new Gue&s;ts, &s;he took it for
granted I was alone, and therefore re&s;olved to provide me with 
<PB N="236" REF="243"> a Male Bed-fellow, as a proper Con&s;olation for a
Per&s;on in my unhappy Situation.</P>
<P>About &s;even o'Clock in the Morning, not then clear Day, &s;he
very furiou&s;ly pu&s;hed open the Chamber-Door, and told me, one Mr.
<HI>B&mdash;k</HI> de&s;ired to breakfa&s;t with me, who was a Member of
P&mdash;t, and a Man of Fortune, and the Per&s;on who had taken the Hou&s;e. I
told her I never wi&s;hed to &s;ee any human Creature, and &s;hould be glad I
could hide my&s;elf even from my|&s;elf; but &s;he, &s;uppo&s;ing me to be
alone, directly introduced a Man, full &s;ix Feet high, and of the mo&s;t
di&s;agreeable A&s;pect I ever beheld&mdash;Perhaps it was my Terror that
painted him &s;o to my Imagination.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted up and threw my Gown about me, but I was not quite
&s;o quick in putting on my Clothes as the Gentleman was, in taking his off,
re&s;olving, without the lea&s;t Ceremony to come to Bed to me, I pulled my
Companion, who a&s;ked him what he meant; why, who the D&mdash;l are you, you
old B&mdash;ch &s;aid he: This Lady, mean|ing me, is publickly known thro' all
the Coffee-hou&s;es in <HI>Dublin.</HI> Had the Gentle|man 
<PB N="237" REF="244"> been &s;tudying how to di&s;appoint his own Intentions,
he could not more effectual|ly have done it, as he brought all the Horror of my
Condition full upon my Mind. And as I had no Protector, no Friend, no Guardian,
I bur&s;t into Tears, and told him, if he was a Gentleman, he would not
in&s;ult Mi&s;ery. 
<Q REND="inline">'Do I occa&s;ion Tears, Madam?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You do, Sir, and and therefore I de&s;ire you
will depart.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, Madam, &s;aid he, I beg pardon, I had a
full Hi&s;tory of you from the Maid of the Hou&s;e, who &s;aid, &s;he believed
a Companion would not be di&s;agreeable to you, e&s;pecially as &s;he was
apprehen&s;ive you had no Money.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir, &s;aid I, &s;he is mi&s;taken, I have at
lea&s;t enough to di&s;|charge my Lodging, which I will imme|diately do; and
once more I de&s;ire you to withdraw, which accordingly he did.'</Q></P>
<P>I then prevailed on the young Woman who was with me to take a
Lodging for me, and in about half an Hour I went to it. 
<Q> <PB N="238" REF="245">

Fellow-Lodger, one Mr. <HI>Don|nellan,</HI> an En&s;ign, who it &s;eems knew me
&s;o well, that he thought proper to bring the late Earl of
<HI>R&mdash;&s;&s;e,</HI> of facetious Me|mory, and &s;everal other Per&s;ons
of Di&s;tinc|tion, to break open my Lodging. On hearing them coming up Stairs,
I ran into the Dining-Room, and locked my&s;elf in. When tho&s;e worthy
P&mdash;rs could not find me, they threatened to kick the Landlady; and one of
them putting his Mouth to the Key-hole of the Dining-Room, cried, 
<Q REND="inline">'Do, my Dear, open the Door; by Heaven! it is

di&s;appointed, they were forced to decamp, cur&s;ing and vowing Revenge
again&s;t the Woman of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This Accident &s;o terribly alarmed me, that I re&s;olved to quit
this Lodging the next Day; but Mr. <HI>D&mdash;n</HI> was de|termined not to
permit me to depart in Peace; for, being a military Man, he &s;tood Centinel at
the Door of my Chamber all Night, frequently intreating me to let him in; but
truly had I been amorou&s;ly in|clined, <PB N="243" REF="250"> the Sight of the
various Medicines in his Apartment would have 
<Q> 
<L>Damp'd all Pa&s;&s;ion &s;ympathetic.</L></Q> For, as I had a
back Room, when this Gentleman was abroad, I frequently, for Variety, went into
his, which looked into the Street.</P>
<P>However, at la&s;t he went to Bed; and early next Morning he told
the Landlady that I had kept him awake all Night, and that I was a mo&s;t
notorious common S&mdash;t.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Arah, by my Shoul (&s;aid the old Dame) you would

with her? One of them bid the Devil to breake my own Neck; but I hope he will
be hanged fir&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>While my Landlady, to whom I had never told my Name, related this
to me, I heard &s;omebody enquire for Mrs. <HI>Pilking|ton,</HI> &s;o I
de&s;ired to know who it was, and up came a very well dre&s;t matron like
Fe|male of about Fifty; &s;he expre&s;&s;ed great <PB N="244" REF="251">
Concern for my Misfortunes; &s;aid, my dear Father had &s;aved her Life, and
that &s;he was at pre&s;ent Hou&s;e-keeper to the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;m,</HI>
who was extremely troubled for his Rudene&s;s to me, and hoped I would give him
an Opportunity of beg|ging my Pardon. I told her, as I did not know whom to
blame, I wanted no Apo|logy; it was my wretched Fate to be &s;ub|ject to the
In&s;olence of every Fellow.</P>
<P>She then urged, what I own was a pre|vailing Argument to one not
worth a Shil|ling, that my Lord was very generous, and would, &s;he was &s;ure,
make me a hand|&s;ome Pre&s;ent, in Recompence of the Ter|ror he had put me
into. As I looked on my pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances to be quite de|&s;perate,
being near Lying-in, and having nothing to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, I agreed to &s;ee
him any where, except at my own Lodging. Upon which the artful old Crone told
me of a Hou&s;e in the Neighbourhood, a very reputable one according to her
Account, where my Lord would meet me in the Evening.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="252">Accordingly I went; but let any one judge of
my Surprize, when in&s;tead of the Earl, I met a Gentleman whom I had never
&s;een before: So I in&s;tantly departing left him to his Contemplations. And
in Pro|ce&s;s of Time it came to light, that the venerable Hou&s;e-keeper of
the Earl, was neither better or wor&s;e than the celebrated Mother
<HI>Brown:</HI> And indeed I received many Vi&s;its from Ladies of her
&s;ublime Calling.</P>
<P>And what mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed me, was, that they were generally
employed by &s;ober mar|ried Men, and &s;uch as to my own Know|ledge, lived
very well with their Wives; but the&s;e Ladies a&s;&s;ured me, their Hu&s;bands
hated them, and would rather have any other Woman. So I found I was not a|lone
in my Misfortune. And if every married Man, who has ever attacked me, does not
&s;ub&s;cribe to my <HI>Memoirs,</HI> I will, without the lea&s;t Ceremony,
in&s;ert their Names, be their Rank ever &s;o high, or their Profe&s;&s;ion
ever &s;o holy.

Countenance, that <PB N="259" REF="266"> &s;he too well under&s;tood him, and
that he was out of Hope of obtaining her Pardon, unle&s;s &s;omething pretty

<P>Mr. <HI>W&mdash;e</HI> now began to make &s;ome Figure; and tho'
he kept me pretty fully employed, he drove an underhand Trade with Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n.</HI> And as he was not willing that either of us &s;hould
believe him incapable of Writing, he u&s;ed to &s;hew Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s
Work to me, and &s;wear it was his own; and in return, he, with the &s;ame
mode&s;t A&s;&s;urance, pre&s;ented mine to him; but we were too well
acquainted with each other's Stile to be deceived. At la&s;t, Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> not &s;atisfied with all the Ex|pence he put him to in
<HI>London,</HI> made a Demand on him for fifty Pounds; but as Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> had before made the be&s;t Penny of me to him he
po&s;&s;ibly could, and <HI>W&mdash;le</HI> finding what I wrote pa&s;&s;ed
every Jot as well his, he thought it mo&s;t convenient, if he did di&s;bur&s;e
any thing, to give it to me, as thinking I mo&s;t wanted it; &s;o I was now
full of Poetical Bu&s;ine&s;s, <PB N="264" REF="271"> by which my Poverty was
relieved, and my Mind amu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> was &s;o vexed at lo&s;ing his Chap, that
in Revenge he endeavoured to in&s;inuate that we conver&s;ed unlawfully
to|gether; but this met no Credit, as I very &s;eldom &s;aw him, and never
alone.</P>
<P>In the mean time he carried on a vigorous Pro&s;ecution again&s;t
me in the Spiritual Court, in which I gave him no oppo&s;ition; as he
&s;olemnly declared he would always allow me a Maintenance to the utmo&s;t of
his Ability; and to live with him, I by no means de&s;ired. 
<Q> 
<L>For never cou'd true Reconcilement &s;pring</L> 
<L>Where Wounds of deadly Hate &s;o deep were fix'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>But no &s;ooner had he obtained a Separa|tion from me, but he
retracted every Word he had &s;aid; not only refu&s;ing to give me any
A&s;&s;i&s;tance, but al&s;o abu&s;ing me, in the mo&s;t unchri&s;tian,
fal&s;e, and &s;candalous manner, and publickly triumphed in hav|ing
over-reached me. Upon this I was <PB N="265" REF="272"> advi&s;ed to lodge an
Appeal again&s;t him, which made him quite mad. He abu&s;ed his Advocate
Proctor, and the Judge him&s;elf, as all doing him Inju&s;tice; and tho' I knew
none of them, in&s;i&s;ted on it, they were Confederates with me again&s;t
him.</P>
<P>But this outragious manner of Proceed|ing rather injured him&s;elf
than me; the Delegates were appointed; and as every body whom he con&s;ulted,
a&s;&s;ured him, he would be ca&s;t, his haughty Spirit was will|ing to
capitulate; but nobody would un|dertake to deliver his Me&s;&s;age to me,
lea&s;t he &s;hould &s;candalize them for it; &s;o at length with great
Entreaty he prevailed on <HI>W&mdash;le</HI> to make a Propo&s;al from him, to
me, of giving me a &s;mall Annuity, and thirty Pounds in Money, which, in
regard to my Children, I rather cho&s;e to accept of, than ruin their Father,
as I certainly had it in my power to do.</P>
<P><HI>W&mdash;le,</HI> who has really a good deal of Humour, came to
me one Morning after my being a Week without &s;eeing him, and in a Theatrical
manner delivered the following Speech: 
<Q><PB N="266" REF="273">Before I &s;peak the Me&s;&s;age of the

<P>I wondered what odd Whim had now taken <HI>W&mdash;le</HI>; and
begged he would deliver him&s;elf like a Man of this World.</P>
<P>He then related the Propo&s;al afore|mentioned, on which I
de&s;ired two Days time to con&s;ider, and then acquie&s;ced, and withdrew the
Appeal, like an ea&s;y Fool as I was.</P>
<P>Dearly have I &s;ince repented it, as no Articles of the Agreement
were kept, altho' I thought they were as &s;trongly a&s;&s;ured to me, as the
Law could make them; in which there are &s;o many Loop-holes, that even
Per&s;ons conver&s;ant with it may be de|ceived; how then &s;hould a Female be
&s;ufficiently on her Guard, again&s;t the Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of a kind of
unintelligible Jargon, who&s;e Skill is to puzzle the Cau&s;e, or a Science
where,

<P><PB N="267" REF="274">Of the Thirty Pounds, I never received but
Fifteen, and tho&s;e Mr. <HI>W&mdash;le</HI> a&s;|&s;ured me he advanced out of

<P>But Heav'n knows, as I had every thing to provide for a Child, and
my&s;elf, and Rent al&s;o to pay, this Sum la&s;ted not long, e&s;pecially as I
had no Friend near me.&mdash;No; nor any hone&s;t Per&s;on; for my Landlady, of

in&s;i&s;ted either on my paying double the Rent I had engaged for, or quitting
her Hou&s;e, which, as it was then too late for me to do, I was
nece&s;&s;itated to comply with her exorbitant Demand, which made her very
complai&s;ant.</P>
<P>Before I had received even this &s;mall Re|lief I wrote to many
Ladies, to whom my Father had been Phy&s;ician, and who once &s;eemed to be my
Friends; but to no pur|po&s;e; their con&s;tant An&s;wer was, that I de&s;erved
nothing; to which general Rule, I never met with but two Exceptions.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="275">I wrote al&s;o to the B&mdash;p of

Succe&s;s, I think I mu&s;t pardon him; e&s;pe|cially, as on my threatning to
expo&s;e him &s;ince I came to <HI>Ireland,</HI> he, to bribe me to Secrecy,
&s;ent me one Pound, a remark|able and unaccountable Charity from his
Lord&s;hip, to any Per&s;on of whom he had not Carnal Knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="276">And tho' in a Letter of his, he a&s;&s;ures

turning a Stake, when it was a little too hot, burned his Finger, on which he
licked it, and found it &s;o &s;avory, that he devoured that part which was
intended for the Gods; and as the Laity beheld him, to their Opinion, breaking
the Law in eating Fle&s;h, he a&s;&s;ured them, that he had an immediate
Revelation, that it was lawful for him to eat the prime Part of the Fle&s;h,
and leave the Garbage for the Laity. Thus we may &s;ee how early Prie&s;tcraft

an excellent Politician, and had a Divine Revelation that the Land &s;hould
&s;uffer Famine ten Years, ordered the Prie&s;ts to pay in all their
Sub&s;idies to the King, whereby, in tho&s;e ten Years of Dearth, the King

<P>I concluded by this Letter, that the poor Man's Head was turned,
and therefore, thought it not worth an&s;wering, being now &s;eriou&s;ly
determined to leave <HI>Ireland</HI>; for, though I led the Life of a
Reclu&s;e, I had every Day &s;ome new Story invented of me. If I went out to
take a little Air, they &s;aid, I had great Impudence to &s;hew my Face; and if
I &s;taid at Home, I was then in Keep|ing with &s;ome Man who confined me; and,
in &s;hort, I could plea&s;e nobody: Which gave ri&s;e to the following Lines. 
<Q>

<L>O God! &s;ince all thy Ways are ju&s;t,</L>

<L>Thou did&s;t to Life command?</L>

<L>Lord, give me Penitence &s;incere</L>

<L>And tho' my Trials are &s;evere,</L>
<L>O give me Peace at la&s;t.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>So the&s;e were the la&s;t Strains I &s;ung in <HI>Ireland</HI>;
which, ill-u&s;ed as I was in it, I could not quit without very great Regret;
and as the Coach drove by Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s Door, I thought my very
Heart would &s;plit with Sorrow; for there indeed was all the Trea&s;ure of my
Soul enclo&s;ed; namely, my dear little ones. Many a Sigh and Tear they co&s;t
me; many a Prayer did I offer up to the Almighty for their Pre&s;ervation; and
had he not been an infinitely more gra|cious Father to them, than their earthly
one proved, long long ago had they been finally lo&s;t!</P>
<P>My Eyes, even after I went on board the Yatch, were evermore
turned to the Shore of <HI>Ireland,</HI> re&s;ting there as on their la&s;t
Period; till finding my&s;elf ob&s;erved, and that &s;ome of the
Pa&s;&s;engers, Colonel <HI>Dalway</HI> in particular, wanted to &s;ee my 
<PB N="299" REF="306"> Face, which I concealed, I pretended to be Sea-&s;ick,
and de&s;ired the Steward to &s;hew me a Cabin.</P>
<P>He left me for a few Minutes; and re|turning, told me, all the
Beds were en|gaged; but however, there was a Gentle|man on board, who &s;aid,
he would &s;ooner &s;it up, than a Lady be unprovided for. I returned my
Compliments, without ever &s;o much as enquiring to whom I was obliged.</P>
<P>The Sickne&s;s I feigned proved pre&s;ent|ly true; for no &s;ooner
was the Ship under Sail, but I grew violently Sea-&s;ick; when the Steward once
more entered the Cabin, and told me, the Gentleman, to whom it belonged,
de&s;ired a Moment's Chat with me. I begged him to make my Apology, as indeed,
what with Sickne&s;s and Sorrow, I was little in Temper to receive any
Per&s;on.</P>
<P>However, the Gentleman re&s;olved not to be &s;o ea&s;ily
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; for following the Steward into my Cabin, he told me, he knew
me to be Mrs. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>; that, he could not &s;it up all Night; and
therefore, <PB N="300" REF="307"> he hoped I would not refu&s;e him the
Li|berty of &s;leeping in his own Bed.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, I would not, provided he would be &s;o kind as to
leave me for a few Moments; on which, weak as I was, I &s;prung out of Bed,
and, as I had not un|dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, &s;oon met him upon Deck.</P>
<P>Who this fame Gentleman was, may, in due Sea&s;on, be revealed: I
can only a&s;&s;ure my Readers, that, I believe had I accepted of the Offers he
made me, Pover|ty would never have approached me, as he was a Man of Honour, or
at lea&s;t ap|peared to me as &s;uch: A Man of Fortune he certainly is; and I
doubt not but he has enjoyed many a lovely Lady, without promi&s;ing them any
Reward, or offering them a Settlement for Life, as he really did me.</P>
<P>I dined with him at <HI>Parkgate</HI>; and I hope Virtue will be
rewarded; for though I had but five Guineas in the World to carry me up to
<HI>London,</HI> I yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Cha&s;tity enough to refu&s;e fifty
for a Night's Lodging, and that too from a hand&s;ome well-bred Man, who&s;e
Name if I &s;hould <PB N="301" REF="308"> in&s;ert, all the World would
acknowledge I &s;poke but Truth of him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;carcely ever forget his Words to me, as they &s;eemed
almo&s;t prophetic. 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, Madam, (&s;aid he) you do not know
<HI>London</HI>; you will be undone there.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, Sir, (&s;aid I) I hope you do not imagine I
will go into any bad Cour&s;e of Life?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No, Madam, (&s;aid he) but I think you will &s;it
in your Chamber, and &s;tarve;'</Q> which, upon my Word, I have been pretty
near doing; and, but that the Almighty rai&s;ed me one worthy Friend, good old
Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> to who&s;e Humanity I am, under God, indebted both for
Liberty and Life, I had been quite lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay, nobody will imagine he &s;erved me from any carnal
Views; &s;ince, 
<Q> 
<L>If Truth in Spite of Manners mu&s;t be told,</L> 
<L>Why really Seventy-&s;ix is &s;omething old.</L></Q></P>
<P>So here I clo&s;e the Fir&s;t Volume; and as it has been
indu&s;triou&s;ly and maliciou&s;ly <PB N="302" REF="309"> reported, that I had
in reality nothing to publi&s;h, I hope this will convince the World, that Mrs.
<HI>Pilkington</HI> was never yet reduced to the Meanne&s;s of Fal&s;hood or
Tricking. And if this Volume meets with a favourable Reception, I can
a&s;&s;ure my Readers, the next will be infinitely more entertaining, and is
now ready for the Pre&s;s.</P>
