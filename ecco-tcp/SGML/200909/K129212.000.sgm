<BYLINE><HI>By</HI> THOMAS PAINE,</BYLINE>
<L>THE Rain pours down, the City looks forlorn,</L>
<L>And gloomy &s;ubjects &s;uit the howling morn,</L>
<L>Clo&s;e by my &s;ire, with door and window fa&s;t,</L>
<L>And &s;afely &s;helter'd from the driving bla&s;t,</L>
<L>To gayer thoughts, I bid a days adieu,</L>
<L>To &s;pend a &s;cene of &s;olitude with you.</L>
<L>So oft has black Revenge engros'd the care,</L>
<L>Of all the lei&s;ure hours man finds to &s;pare;</L>
<L>So oft has guilt in all her thou&s;and dens,</L>
<L>Call'd for the vengeance of cha&s;ti&s;ing Pens;</L>
<L>That while, I fain would ea&s;e my heart on you,</L>
<L>No thought is left untold, no pa&s;&s;ion new.</L>
<L>From flight to flight the mental path appears,</L>
<L>Worn with the &s;teps of near &s;ix thou&s;and years,</L>
<L>And fill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d througout with every &s;cene of pain.</L>
<L>From CAIN to G*****, and back from G***** to CAIN.</L>
<L>Alike in cruelty, alike in hate,</L>
<L>In guilt alike, but more alike in fate,</L>
<L>Both curs'd &s;upremely for the blood they drew,</L>
<L>Each from the ri&s;ing world, while each was new.</L>
<L>Go &s;econd CAIN, true likene&s;s of the fir&s;t,</L>
<L>And &s;trew thy bla&s;ted head with homely du&s;t</L>
<L>In a&s;hes &s;it&mdash;in wretched &s;ack-cloth weep</L>
<L>And with unpitied &s;orrows cea&s;e to &s;lee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</L>
<L>Go haunt the tombs, and &s;ingle out the place</L>
<L>Where earth it&s;elf &s;hall &s;uffer a di&s;grace.</L>
<L>Go &s;pell the letters on &s;ome mouldring urn,</L>
<L>And a&s;k if he who &s;leeps there can return.</L>
<L>Go count the numbers that in &s;ile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> lie,</L>
<L>And learn by &s;tudy what it is to die,</L>
<L><PB REF="2" MS="y">For &s;ure that heart&mdash;if any heart you own</L>
<L>Conceits that man expires without a Groan:</L>
<L>That he who lives receives from you a grace,</L>
<L>Or death is nothing but a change of place:</L>
<L>That peace is dull, that joy from &s;orrow &s;prings,</L>
<L>And War the Royal raree &s;hew of things,</L>
<L>El&s;e why the&s;e &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enes that wound the feeling mind</L>
<L>This &s;port of death&mdash;this Cockpit of Mankind.</L>
<L>Why &s;obs the widow in perpetual pain?</L>
<L>Why cries the Orphan?&mdash;"Oh my Father's &s;lain"</L>
<L>Why hangs the Sire his paralytic head?</L>
<L>And nods with manly grief&mdash;"My Son is dead."</L>
<L>Why drops the tears from off the &s;i&s;ters cheek?</L>
<L>And &s;weetly tells the &s;orrows &s;he would &s;peak,</L>
<L>Or why in lonely &s;teps does pen&s;ive John?</L>
<L>To all the neighbours tell, "Poor ma&s;ters gone."</L>
<L>Oh could I paint the pa&s;&s;ion, I can feel,</L>
<L>Or point a horror that would wound like &s;teel</L>
<L>To thy unfeeling, unrelenting mind</L>
<L>I'd &s;end a torture and relieve mankind.</L>
<L>Thou that art hu&s;band, father, brother, all</L>
<L>The tender names which kindred learn to call.</L>
<L>Yet like an image carv'd in ma&s;&s;ey &s;tone,</L>
<L>Thou bear'&s;t the &s;hape, but &s;entiment has't none,</L>
<L>Allied by du&s;t and figure, not by mind,</L>
<L>Thou only herd'&s;t, but liv'&s;t not with mankind.</L>
<L>And prone to love, like &s;ome outrageous ape,</L>
<L>Thou know'&s;t each cla&s;s of beings by their &s;hape.</L>
<L>Since then no hopes to civilize remain</L>
<L>And all petitions have gone forth in vain,</L>
<L>One prayer is left which dreads no proud reply,</L>
<L>That <HI>he</HI> who made thee breath will make thee die.</L>
