<P>THE Fir&s;t Divi&s;ion of this King|dom into <HI>Hundreds</HI> and <HI>Tithings</HI> was ordained by the virtuous and pa|triotic King Alfred,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Lambard's explication of words prefixed to his Archaionomia, on the word <HI>Centuria.</HI></NOTE> who is expres&s;ly &s;aid to have therein followed the prudent Council given by Jethro to Mo&s;es,
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The 1&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment of this prudent advice of Jethro I have examined more at large in my Tract on <HI>"the Law of Nature and Principles of Action in Man,"</HI> p. 325 to 329. Wherein I have &s;hewn <HI>the Right of the People</HI> to ELECT Judges and Officers, Civil as well as Military, (Religious Officers and Mini&s;ters excepted,) from the <HI>Colonel,</HI> or Captain, of a <HI>Thou&s;and,</HI> (who was al&s;o a <HI>ju&s;ticiary,)</HI> down to the Serjeant (Decurio) or Tithingman; (Deut. i. 9-17.) all which Officers were <HI>elected</HI> and <HI>nominated</HI> by the people before they were in|ve&s;ted with Authority by Mo&s;es. This <HI>Right of the People</HI> to ELECT <HI>Judges</HI> and <HI>Officers</HI> is clearly confirmed by a parallel Text in the &s;ame Book. Chap. xvi. 18.&mdash;<Q>JUDGES <HI>and</HI> OFFICERS <HI>&s;halt thou make thee in all thy Gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout thy Tribes, and they &s;hall judge the People with ju&s;t Judgement.</HI></Q> When this is rendered literally ac|cording to the Original, the <HI>popular Right of Election</HI> appears &s;till more manife&s;t.&mdash;<Q>Judges and Officers &s;halt thou give to thy&s;elf,</Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) which could no otherwi&s;e be than by a <HI>free Election</HI> in all their Gates, (i. e. the Gates of their Cities, where the public Courts were anciently held,) for the <HI>Judges and Officers</HI> to each Tribe re&s;pectively.&mdash;Let us be truly thankful to God for the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of his Laws, and let us pray that we may have Grace to adopt them! As far as the nature of our political E&s;tabli&s;hments will legally permit, let us, for the honour of <HI>Human Nature,</HI> imitate the <HI>glorious State of Political Liberty</HI> with which God was plea&s;ed to ble&s;s his people ISRAEL; and in which he would, mo&s;t cer|tainly, have maintained them, if they had per&s;evered in <HI>the right Faith,</HI> and in due obedience to <HI>his Laws!</HI> But, when men for&s;ake GOD, they unavoidably lo&s;e their LIBERTY! Let no man conceive that the <HI>Rights of Election,</HI> which I have proved by Scripture, were the Rights only of a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> Nation, the <HI>People of I&s;rael;</HI> on the contrary, let us remember, that, as <HI>all</HI> Nations under the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation, or rather <HI>all</HI> Nations that are really <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> are &s;aid to be engrafted on the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Olive-Tree, and are thereby entitled to the <HI>name</HI> of ISRAEL, &s;o they are undoubtedly entitled likewi&s;e to all the immunities and privileges of <HI>redeemed I&s;rael:</HI> for, the only <HI>people,</HI> perhaps, that are <HI>judicially</HI> excluded from tho&s;e <HI>national</HI> Rights, are the <HI>Branches</HI> which were <HI>broken off from that good Olive-Tree for their unbelief,</HI> i. e. the Jews them&s;elves, who are <HI>broken off,</HI> indeed, for a <HI>time,</HI> (a long <HI>time,</HI> alas, it has now been!) and are di&s;per&s;ed or <HI>&s;trewed</HI> (like <HI>Dead Branches</HI> &s;epa|rated from their proper Root) <HI>among&s;t all the nations of the Earth;</HI> thus <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> exhibiting, as it were, <HI>a monumental Proof</HI> of the Scripture Te&s;timonies again&s;t that peculiar Nation!</P>
<P>But, under the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation, there is not only the <HI>&s;ame rea&s;on</HI> for claiming to the <HI>people</HI> the I&s;|raeliti&s;h privilege of <HI>electing all temporal</HI> JUDGES and OFFICERS; but there are al&s;o unque&s;tionable Proofs that the <HI>elective Rights</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tian People</HI> are enlarged &s;till farther to the choice of all their <HI>Spiritual Officers;</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ters;</HI> whereas, even in I&s;rael, all <HI>Spiritual Functions</HI> were <HI>hereditary</HI> and not <HI>elective.</HI></P>
<P>Thus are the <HI>Elective Rights</HI> of Chri&s;tian People ex|ceedingly enlarged; and all per&s;ons, who withhold or oppo&s;e the&s;e ju&s;t <HI>Rights,</HI> ought to beware le&s;t they be found at la&s;t among&s;t the Enemies of the <HI>King of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> for it is remarkable that the <HI>great apo&s;tacy,</HI> &s;o long foretold in the Chri&s;tian Church, could not <HI>mani|fe&s;t it&s;elf in power</HI> until the unwearied encroachments and u&s;urpations of <HI>Popes, Emperors,</HI> and <HI>Kings,</HI> had with|drawn from the <HI>Church</HI> (i. e. the <HI>Congregation of Clergy and People</HI> in each Country or Di&s;trict) that <HI>mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Right</HI> of all others, the ancient u&s;age of <HI>electing their own Bi&s;hops!</HI> See a long Note on this Subject beginning at p. 331 of my Tract on the Law of Retribution.</P></NOTE> for
<PB N="4" REF="3">the more commodious Government of <HI>the I&s;raeliti&s;h Commonwealth;</HI> it being,
<PB N="5" REF="4">indeed, an In&s;titution thoroughly con|&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t <HI>perfect &s;tate of Li|berty</HI> that Human Nature is capable of

<PB N="11" REF="10">to yield up a &s;mall portion of their lei&s;ure to the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>exerci&s;e of arms and training,</HI> for their mutual defence again&s;t every act of violence and inju&s;tice; and on this ancient provi&s;ion of the Common Law was apparently founded the <HI>legality</HI> of levying taxes on the inhabitants of London and Middle&s;ex, to make good the <HI>damages</HI> occa&s;ioned by the alarming riots in the year 1780. We ought, therefore, by no means to repine at the late judgement of the Courts, whereby the Riot-Tax, to make good the damages, was deemed legal, even before the Act was made for levying it; but, on the contrary, to promote, as much as po&s;&s;ible, a &s;till more effectual and complete revival of that mo&s;t excellent in&s;titution of the <HI>Common Law,</HI> that it may be con&s;tantly and regularly enforced (even in le&s;s and more ordinary ca&s;es of robbery, hou&s;e-breaking, &amp;c.) for the immediate recovery of all <HI>damages</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="11">and lo&s;&s;es by any <HI>act of violence</HI> what&s;o|ever: the value of the damages &s;hould be levyed on <HI>ten hou&s;ekeepers</HI> that are the neare&s;t inhabitants to the &s;pot where the violence or robbery was committed: and if the 10 <HI>neare&s;t hou&s;ekeepers</HI> &s;hould not be able to made good the damage, then 10 <HI>times</HI> 10 <HI>of the neare&s;t hou&s;e-keepers,</HI> (or the hundred,) ought to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, (and &s;o on, if nece&s;&s;ary, to the whole county, for &s;uch was the an|cient u&s;age by the Common Law,) for the damage; whereby all hou&s;ekeepers would be prompted by their own private intere&s;t to <HI>a&s;&s;ociate in arms</HI> with their re&s;pective neighbours to &s;uppre&s;s every act of unju&s;t violence, and to maintain the public peace.</P>
<P>In the various-accounts of the&s;e ancient Free-boroughs, or <HI>Tithings,</HI> they are &s;ometimes mentioned, as con&s;i&s;ting only of <HI>Ten Men;</HI> at other times, as con&s;i&s;t|ing

<PB N="15" REF="14">Cowell, it is nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that the word <HI>dozeins</HI> is manife&s;tly u&s;ed for <HI>decenns,</HI> or <HI>decenna,</HI> and &s;o al&s;o very fre|quently by other law writers, but I cannot find that the&s;e <HI>legal Societies,</HI> or <HI>A&s;&s;ociations</HI> of neighbours, ever con&s;i&s;ted of <HI>dozeins</HI> or <HI>dozens,</HI> in the ordinary &s;en&s;e of that term, though they are &s;o very frequently called <HI>dozeins,</HI> merely, I pre|&s;ume, by corruption of &s;peech; &s;o that the etymology of the Engli&s;h word <HI>dozen</HI> is not from <HI>duodecim,</HI> as one would natu|rally &s;uppo&s;e from the modern applica|tion of the word, but from <HI>decenna</HI> and <HI>dizaine,</HI> the Latin and French appella|tions of the <HI>Tithings,</HI> which were regu|larly <HI>Decenaries,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>ten men;</HI> or rather <HI>ten men</HI> and their <HI>families,</HI> as I have before remarked. But, in the re|vival of <HI>Decenaries,</HI> which I wi&s;h to promote, the number of per&s;ons in each <HI>Free-borough or Decenary,</HI> (whether it
<PB N="16" REF="15">&s;hall con&s;i&s;t of <HI>ten hou&s;ekeepers with their families and &s;ervants,</HI> or only of <HI>ten men,</HI>) mu&s;t be determined by the votes of the inhabitants them&s;elves in every neigh|bourhood, at their &s;everal <HI>General Meet|ings, Folk-motes,</HI> or <HI>Ward-motes;</HI> be|cau&s;e the &s;ervice mu&s;t be perfectly vo|luntary; for, though the arrangement of the people into <HI>decenary</HI> companies was actually <Q>ordained by the ancient laws of this realm,</Q> and was (and, I tru&s;t, &s;till is) required by the <HI>common law</HI> for the whole kingdom, yet one of the mo&s;t eminent <HI>common-law</HI> writers of his time (Mr. Wm Lambard) mentions the formation of the&s;e <HI>decenary</HI> companies as being <HI>the free act of the people them&s;elves</HI> in every neighbourhood: for, according to him, the ancient u&s;age was, that <Q><HI>all free borne men &s;houlde</HI> CAST THEM|SELVES <HI>into &s;everal companies by tenne in eche companie,</HI></Q> &amp;c. (Duties of Con|&s;tables,
<PB N="17" REF="16">&amp;c. p. 7.) and our ance&s;tors could not have had any more urgent in|ducement, to render this &s;ervice volun|tary, than what the pre&s;ent generation actually feels, viz. the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-defence again&s;t <HI>rioters, thieves, robbers,</HI> and <HI>hou&s;e-breakers;</HI> for, Mr. Lambard informs us, ju&s;t before, in the &s;ame page, that <Q><HI>it was ordained for the more &s;ure</HI> KEEPING OF THE PEACE, <HI>and for the better repre&s;&s;ing of</HI> THIEVES <HI>and</HI> ROB|BERS, <HI>that all free-born men &s;hould</HI> CAST THEMSELVES <HI>into &s;everal com|panies,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> &s;o that <HI>the</HI> REASON <HI>of this law,</HI> on which <HI>the</HI> FORCE of it &s;hould depend, does not only <HI>&s;till</HI> &s;ub|&s;i&s;t, but is certainly as forcible and ur|gent as ever it was. And, though this excellent cu&s;tom was become almo&s;t ob|&s;olete, through neglect and di&s;u&s;e, &s;o long ago as the reign of <HI>Queen Elizabeth,</HI> yet, even then, it was &s;till con&s;idered as

<P>"No &s;huffling arts or equivocations what&s;oever can lighten this mon&s;trous load of guilt, for which the of|fenders mu&s;t <HI>one day</HI> mo&s;t certainly be called to account, notwith&s;tanding that they may have e&s;caped the penal|ties of this Engli&s;h Statute: for indeed it is merely the penalties (or execution) of the &s;aid Statute which they e&s;cape and not the guilt of breaking it; becau&s;e the &s;ame is &s;o warily drawn up, that there is not the lea&s;t room for mental re&s;ervation.</P>
<P>"A very large proportion of the freeholders in this kingdom, it is to be feared, are involved in this horrid guilt!

Bribes in mo|ney, places, &amp;c. are not productive of half &s;o much evil as the debaucheries of <HI>election entertainments,</HI> be|cau&s;e the pernicious effects of the latter are &s;o perma|nent, that they may fairly be &s;aid to be tran&s;mitted from <HI>election</HI> to <HI>election.</HI> The gro&s;s immorality, as well as the deplorable idlene&s;s and poverty, (all forerunners of &s;lavery) which too much prevail in many parts of this kingdom ought, (I &s;incerely believe) to be principally attributed to the unlawful practice of <HI>opening hou&s;es for public entertainment at elections:</HI> and we cannot hope that this dangerous evil will ever be corrected, unle&s;s the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lature &s;hall hereafter think fit to oblige every candidate (as &s;oon as he declares him|&s;elf &s;uch) to promi&s;e, upon oath, that he will &s;trictly ob|&s;erve every article of the la&s;t mentioned Act, again&s;t treating electors. This long digre&s;&s;ion, from the &s;ubject of Negro Slaves, the author hopes may be pardoned, e&s;pecially if the reader will plea&s;e to con&s;ider, that ci|vil and political Slavery, as well as Slavery to &s;en&s;ual appetites, are &s;o very nearly connected with each other, in their nature and effects, that it is no very con&s;iderable tran&s;ition from the pre&s;ent point to &s;peak of them together. But the ca&s;e of this poor Negro is very dif|ferent. If he is a Slave, yet it was not with his own con&s;ent that he was made &s;o. He neither <HI>&s;old him&s;elf,</HI> nor has he <HI>betrayed others,</HI> and cannot therefore be liable to &s;uch &s;evere penalties. He has not been guilty of any offences, that I know of, for which he might <HI>lawfully</HI> (like corrupt and venal voters who accept of money, meat, or drink, at elections) <HI>be dive&s;ted of his humanity;</HI> and therefore it mu&s;t certainly be allowed, that he dif|fers from a hor&s;e or a dog in this very <HI>e&s;&s;ential point,</HI> viz. <HI>his humanity."</HI></P></NOTE> would be prevented.</P>

<P>We need not wonder, therefore, at his boldne&s;s, in u&s;urping an <HI>unlimited</HI> authority over the poor <HI>unarmed</HI> Italian BISHOPS, (who were otherwi&s;e his equals in real dignity of office,) depo&s;ing them <Q><HI>according to his will,</HI></Q> (a manife&s;t token of the Bea&s;t,) and openly violating the mo&s;t &s;acred <HI>rights</HI> of the Italian CLERGY, AND PEOPLE, in their <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> elections, that he might fill the Italian &s;ees with <HI>Monki&s;h</HI> Prelates, who would be more attached to the growing power than <HI>married Bi&s;hops,</HI> &s;uch as were, for the mo&s;t part, tho&s;e of the primi|tive Church. But the particular in&s;tance, which I propo|&s;ed to mention, was at Rimini, in the year 591, where, on the death of a Bi&s;hop, Gregory &s;ent a legate to interfere in the <HI>election;</HI> and one Odeatinus, a nobleman, being never|thele&s;s <HI>elected</HI> Bi&s;hop, the <HI>Pontif was plea&s;ed</HI> (PLACU|ISSET PONTIFICI) to command them, on pain of <HI>ponti|fical cen&s;ure,</HI> to place <HI>another per&s;on</HI> in the &s;ee. The man <HI>elected</HI> and <HI>con&s;ecrated</HI> for this purpo&s;e by Gregory was Ca&s;torius, who, not being <HI>elected</HI> by the people of Rimini, was of cour&s;e thwarted by them, and &s;uffered many things by PARTY OPPOSITION, the very evil which Gregory pretended to avoid by his MOST PAR|TIAL <HI>corruption</HI> of the election, <Q>ne illam, i. e. <HI>elec|tionem,</HI> STUDIA PARTIUM <HI>corrumperent,</HI></Q> for that was his plea for interference. Be&s;ides this oppo&s;ition, Ca&s;torius was grievou&s;ly afflicted with a di&s;temper in his head, on account of which he was invited by the <HI>Pontif</HI> to change the air and vi&s;it him at Rome; but, being even there no better, he reque&s;ted the Pontif that a Pa&s;tor might be &s;ent to his church, who could better promote the divine &s;ervice; and, when the Pontif's hope of Ca&s;torius's recovery by the Roman air abated, he admini&s;tered the charge of the church of Rimini by Leontius, Bi&s;hop of Urbin, (a &s;econd u&s;urpation,) who was al&s;o a Bi&s;hop of <HI>his own</HI> appointment. In the mean while the &s;ick <HI>Ca&s;torius</HI> urged the Pontif with his entreaties; and at length prevailed on him to grant "POWER TO THE CLERGY AND PEOPLE" of Rimini to <HI>"elect a Bi&s;hop for them&s;elves,"</HI> (i. e. to be re-in&s;tated in their ancient <HI>right,</HI>) <Q>which was done <HI>in the year</HI> 595,</Q> <HI>as may ea&s;ily be known</HI> (&s;ays my author) <Q><HI>from the Epi&s;tles of Gregory the Great;</HI></Q> and he refers us to the <HI>decretals,</HI> where the whole affair (&s;ays he) is re|lated.

For the ancient cu&s;tome of England, for the pre&s;ervation of the publike peace, was that every free-borne man, at fourteene yeeres of age, after <HI>Bracton,</HI> (religious per&s;ons, clerkes, knights, and their elde&s;t &s;onnes ex|cepted,) &s;hould find <HI>&s;urety</HI> for his truth toward the king and his &s;ubjects, or el&s;e be kept <HI>in pri&s;on,</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Lambard al&s;o mentions this cu&s;tom of <HI>impri|&s;oning</HI> tho&s;e that could not <HI>find &s;urety.</HI> See his Tract on "the Duties of <HI>Con&s;tables,</HI>" p. 7 and 8. I will re|cite his words, beginning with the preceding paragraph, for the &s;ake of more fully explaining the nature of <HI>pledges</HI> as well as their a&s;&s;ociation in <HI>tithing</HI> and <HI>hundred</HI> courts. After mentioning the cau&s;e of a&s;&s;ociating in <HI>tithing</HI> or decenary companies, viz. <Q>&mdash;<HI>for the better repre&s;&s;ing of theeves and robbers,</HI></Q> he adds, <Q>the&s;e companies be yet in &s;ome places of England, (and namely with us in Kent,) called BOROES, of the &s;aide word BORHES, <HI>pledges</HI> or SUERTIE: albeit in the We&s;terne partes of the realme they be commonly named TYTHINGS, becau&s;e they containe (as I told you) the number of TENNE MEN <HI>with their families.</HI> And even as <HI>tenne times tenne</HI> doe make an HUNDRED, &s;o, becau&s;e it was then al&s;o <HI>appointed that</HI> TENNE OF THESE COMPANIES &s;houlde at certain times</Q> (every three weeks

<PB N="126" REF="127">This article is very different from the French original, as well as from Fleta, and the &s;uppo&s;ed Statute of Edward II. and it is not ea&s;y to trace from any, or all, of the&s;e copies what has been originally intended. Accord|ing to the old copy of the Myrrour it &s;hould be <Q><HI>of the dre&s;&s;ers</HI> (or patchers) <HI>of old cloths dwelling</HI></Q> &amp;c.^w as if the object was to prevent a &s;ecret vamping|up of old, un&s;aleable, or damaged, clothes in order to pa&s;s them for new. In the articles of 18th Edward II. (N^o 30,) it is <Q><HI>of cloth-&s;ellers and curriers of lea|ther^x dwelling out of merchant-towns,</HI></Q> which I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e to re&s;pect rather
<PB N="127" REF="128">the <HI>markets,</HI> than the <HI>dwellings,</HI> of the <HI>cloth-&s;ellers</HI> and <HI>curriers,</HI> viz. that all whole&s;ale dealing in <HI>cloths</HI> and <HI>leather</HI> &s;hould be at public markets, e&s;tabli&s;hed in great towns like the famous <HI>cloth</HI>-markets at Leeds and Halifax, and like the great <HI>leather</HI>-market in <HI>Leadenhall,</HI> that proper market prices may be regu|larly a&s;certained and known for the common benefit of the manufacturers as well as merchants.</P>
<P>And, if this be really the intention of the article, it will enable us the better to under&s;tand how far a man was formerly prohibited from exerci&s;ing two &s;everal trades, viz. not any two trades in gene|ral, but only &s;uch trades as are &s;o parti|cularly connected together, that the ex|erci&s;e of both by one man might, in &s;ome degree, affect the public markets, and (like <HI>fore&s;talling</HI>) prevent the fixing of
<PB N="128" REF="129">regular market-prices; and even this <HI>limitation</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>limited</HI> to &s;uch trades only which may affect the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary arti|cles of life;</HI> for &s;o, I think, we may un|der&s;tand the examples recited by Fleta; "that the <HI>&s;hoe-maker"</HI> (and, of cour&s;e, all other con&s;umers of <HI>leather,</HI> the <HI>&s;adler,</HI> the <HI>breeches</HI>-maker, the <HI>glove</HI>-maker) <HI>"&s;hall not be a tanner,"</HI> (for, otherwi&s;e, the proper market-price for <HI>leather</HI> could not be &s;o ea&s;ily a&s;certained,) <Q><HI>nor the tanner a butcher,</HI></Q> (which would in|jure the <HI>fell</HI>-market for <HI>pells</HI> and <HI>hides,</HI> and would give him an undue advantage over other tanners,) <Q><HI>nor the bu&s;ine&s;s of a taylor</HI></Q> to be exerci&s;ed (perhaps) by a <HI>clothier,</HI> or manufacturer of cloth, which would injure the <HI>cloth</HI>-markets; but of this la&s;t article I am uncertain; for I acknowledge that I do not under&s;tand what is meant by the abbreviated words

The old Saxon laws puni&s;hed every la&s;civious affront, or impudent incivility, to women, which might be deemed a leading &s;tep to greater injuries, by pro|portionable <HI>amerciaments,</HI> which the <HI>Court-Leets</HI> and <HI>Views</HI> may &s;urely re&s;ume, if they plea&s;e, in favour of <HI>morality,</HI> to vindicate the ju&s;t rights of mode&s;t women, and to promote honourable marriage, which is notori|ou&s;ly hindered by the prevalence and facility of whore|doms, and by the general neglect of doing ju&s;tice to poor, injured, helple&s;s, girls,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is unrea&s;onable and unnatural that all the difficulties and ill con&s;equences of temptation between the youth of both &s;exes &s;hould be cruelly laid upon the <HI>weaker ve&s;&s;el,</HI> whereby &s;he is too often irrecove|rably loft, and added to the pitiable &s;warms of wretched female &s;edu|cers to revenge her injury on the other &s;ex by the communication of a loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;e, till her wretched career in the &s;ervice of Satan is clo&s;ed by a mi&s;erable and hopele&s;s death! The <HI>marriage act</HI> has greatly added to the promotion of the&s;e evils, by taking away the force of contracts, and other circum&s;tances of the <HI>common law,</HI> that was favourable to the ca&s;es of injured young women, and this merely to indulge the unrea&s;onable pride of families&punc;</NOTE> by puni&s;hing their &s;e|ducers, who, in ancient times, would have been com|pelled to marry them.</P>
<P>The coroners were particularly required to vindicate the rights of females by enquiring after <HI>rapes,</HI> as ap|pears by the la&s;t quotation from the articles of 18th Edward II. This circum&s;tance is not mentioned in Fleta, though we there find a di&s;tinct article re&s;pecting coroners, in which, however, this crime, as being a <HI>felony,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be included. &mdash; <Q><HI>Item de feloniis quorum clamor non pervenit ad coronatores.</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q><HI>Al&s;o concerning</HI> FELONIES, <HI>the cry of which did not reach the</HI> CORONERS.</Q> The <HI>rights</HI> of the crown ought al&s;o to be enquired after at the <HI>torns</HI> of the &s;heriffs, and at <HI>Views of Frankpledge,</HI> (and undoubtedly al&s;o at other <HI>Leets,</HI>) not only of <HI>alienations</HI> of land, &amp;c. but al&s;o of <HI>e&s;cheats</HI> of every kind, and of the <HI>fines, amerciaments,</HI> and other profits, of the&s;e popular courts, which, how|&s;oever they may have been granted to private lords of manours, may always be re&s;umed according to the true, <HI>legal,</HI> doctrine of <HI>"nullum tempus occurrit Regi,"</HI> as <HI>res fi&s;calis,</HI> a branch of the public revenue, which ought never to be &s;old or transferred by any King to another per&s;on, being <Q><HI>res qua&s;i &s;acra quae dari non pote&s;t, nec vendi, nec ad alium transferri a principe vel a Rege regnante;</HI></Q> whereas it is otherwi&s;e in the alienation of <HI>lands, tenements,</HI> &amp;c. in which, <Q><HI>tempus currit contra Regem &s;icut contra quamlibet privatam per&s;onam,</HI></Q> as I have &s;hewn in a di&s;tinct tract on that doctrine. But the <HI>more &s;acred</HI> branches of the public revenue, tho&s;e which are properly <HI>res fi&s;calis,</HI> &s;hould be carefully enquired after; for, if they were duly levied and paid into the exchequer to the public accompt, they would con&s;iderably augment the national trea&s;ure without <HI>burthening</HI> the people, nay, they would be really, on the contrary, <HI>profitable</HI> to the people, not only in a <HI>moral</HI> &s;en&s;e, by re&s;training vice of every kind, but al&s;o in <HI>pecuniary</HI> advantage, by lowering the <HI>poor's rates,</HI> and by aiding the national trea&s;ury, in &s;o e&s;&s;ential a manner as would render le&s;s taxes nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The 22d article in Fleta, charges the <HI>Leet</HI>-juries with the con&s;ervation of the rights of the crown. <Q><HI>Et &s;i in</HI> TURNIS VICOMITIS <HI>vel</HI> VISIBUS HUNDREDARUM <HI>tunc &s;ic, de jure regis relato, vel alienato in terra, vel in mari, per quem fuerit alienatum, vel celatum, et a quo tempore.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Notice &s;hould al&s;o be taken of any <HI>new</HI> cu&s;toms or u&s;ages &s;et up either in land or water.

"&mdash; <HI>&s;auns faire l'a&s;&s;e&s;&s;e,</HI>" which, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;hould rather be <HI>l'a&s;&s;i&s;e,</HI> i. e. without demanding a due enquiry into their ca&s;e by <HI>inque&s;t</HI> or <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;e</HI> of a <HI>jury.</HI> The priviledge &s;hould afford them, indeed, a &s;hort, temporary, a&s;ylum from any &s;ingle, mercile&s;s, credi|tor, yet not &s;o as to favour their e&s;cape, but merely to give them time to call their other ju&s;t creditors toge|ther, in order to make an equal divi&s;ion, as far as their effects will go, after giving up <HI>all</HI> upon oath, and then to be ab&s;olutely at liberty by the <HI>common law</HI> without fear of farther arre&s;t if there is no ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion of conceal|ment. The <HI>"due proce&s;s of the law"</HI> is &s;acred, and ought not to be baffled (nor even <HI>delayed</HI> in any other manner than what I have de&s;cribed) by abu&s;es of <HI>privi|ledged places;</HI> and therefore all <HI>Court-Leets</HI> or <HI>trithings</HI> are competent, as being <HI>"Courts of the King,"</HI> to vindicate the <HI>law,</HI> and to limit the a&s;ylum of <HI>privi|ledged places</HI> within rea&s;onable bounds, &s;o as to <HI>relieve</HI> oppre&s;&s;ed debtors without <HI>violently injuring</HI> the <HI>ju&s;t rights</HI> of creditors. The old common law cu&s;tom before-mentioned in behalf of debtors, viz. that they &s;hould be ab&s;olutely relieved from the fear of arre&s;t, by giving up all their effects, upon oath, among&s;t their creditors, was called, in the North of England, <HI>"&s;wearing them&s;elves bare,"</HI> and I remember &s;ome in&s;tances of it &s;everal years ago, but whether it is &s;till in u&s;e I do not know: it is, however, a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> u&s;age; which, under the regulation of <HI>Court-Leets,</HI> (were they univer&s;ally revived,) might prevent the <HI>impri&s;onment,</HI> and con&s;equent <HI>ruin,</HI> of many u&s;eful and indu&s;trious members of &s;ociety. The only circum&s;tance remaining to be cited from the articles of 18th Edward II. is N^o 33. <Q><HI>Of &s;uch as take doves in winter by door-falls or engines.</HI></Q> <HI>Door-falls</HI> are not mentioned in the original, but <HI>"laces,"</HI> for <HI>lacets,</HI> noo&s;es or <HI>&s;nares.</HI> Some other very nece&s;&s;ary &s;ubjects of enquiry are mentioned by Fleta though omitted in all the other li&s;ts of articles, viz. concerning <HI>all neglects in keeping watch and ward,</HI> and concerning the King's high-ways not duly widened. (N^o 28.) <Q><HI>Item de vigiliis non ob&s;ervatis, et viis rega|libus non elargatis.</HI></Q> And, la&s;tly, (all the <HI>other articles having been already cited.</HI>) <Q><HI>Item de hiis qui retinuerint probatores.</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q><HI>Al&s;o of tho&s;e who had re|tained provers,</HI></Q> or (as they were commonly called) <HI>"approvers."</HI> An approver <Q><HI>&s;ignifieth, in our common law,</HI></Q> (&s;ays Dr. Cowell,) <Q><HI>one, that confe&s;&s;ing felony of him&s;elfe, appealeth or accu&s;eth another, one or more, to be guilty of the &s;ame; and he is called &s;o, becau&s;e hee mu&s;t</HI> PROOVE <HI>that which hee hath alleadged in his appeale.</HI> Staunf. pl. cor. fo. 142. <HI>And that proofe is by battell, or by the countrey, at his election that appealed.</HI></Q> &amp;c. And whil&s;t the barbarous and un|rea&s;onable cu&s;tom of <HI>"trials by battle"</HI> continued, a hardened villain that was &s;kilful at cudgeling, could bear a hearty drubbing, had it in his power (if it be true that the <HI>appellor</HI> had the election of the kind of trial and not the <HI>appellee</HI>) to compel any hone&s;t man that happened to be weaker than him&s;elf, either to ri&s;que the misfortune of an unequal combat, or to lo&s;e his land and fly the country.

With re&s;pect to his <HI>&s;econd</HI> po&s;ition, I &s;hall briefly remark, that, though <Q><HI>the love of power, riches, honour, and fame, are,</HI></Q> indeed mo&s;t commonly <Q><HI>the great inoitements to generous and magna|nimous actions,</HI></Q> yet, for the honour of human nature, the&s;e are not to be deemed the <HI>only</HI> incitements, becau&s;e the MOST <HI>"generous"</HI> and the MOST <Q><HI>magnanimous actions</HI></Q> have much more noble <HI>incitements</HI> than he has conceived, viz. the <HI>love of God,</HI> and the <HI>natural love</HI> of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>right;</HI> &s;o that his po&s;ition proves nothing again&s;t the merit of actions that are <HI>truly</HI> and <HI>perfectly generous.</HI> And, be&s;ides the&s;e worthy <HI>incitements,</HI> the agency, or influence, of GOD's HOLY SPIRIT is al&s;o to be deemed an <HI>incitement to generous and magnanimous actions;</HI> nay, it is certainly the highe&s;t <HI>incitement,</HI> or the <HI>&s;upreme principle of action in man,</HI> by which <HI>all</HI> chri&s;tians <HI>ought</HI> to be influenced, and mo&s;t certainly <HI>may</HI> be &s;o, if they do not neglect the promi&s;ed <HI>means!</HI> This, I tru&s;t, is amply proved in my tract on <HI>the Law of Nature,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> and <HI>fifth</HI> po&s;itions are grounded on a &s;trange mi&s;under&s;tanding of the true doctrine concern|ing <HI>non-re&s;i&s;tance;</HI> for though, we are, indeed, required to forgive <HI>per&s;onal injuries,</HI> and to &s;ubmit to them with chri&s;tian meekne&s;s, when any one of <HI>our&s;elves</HI> is indivi|dually the &s;ufferer, neverthele&s;s we are, mo&s;t certainly, bound in chri&s;tian duty to <HI>re&s;i&s;t evil</HI> and <HI>injury</HI> whenever the <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> or <HI>property,</HI> of <HI>other</HI> men are in danger; and to defend <HI>each other</HI> from all unju&s;t <HI>violence</HI> and <HI>ra|pine,</HI> whenever it is in our power to do &s;o; and that even at the ri&s;k of our lives, which I have fully &s;tated in my tracts on <HI>Crown Law</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience.</HI> And, if individuals may, legally, and con&s;i&s;tently with their duty as chri&s;tians, <HI>re&s;i&s;t evil</HI> in defence of <HI>each other,</HI> &s;urely a whole chri&s;tian community, or <HI>nation,</HI> may, mo&s;t con&s;cientiou&s;ly, be allowed, in their united legi&s;lative or executive capacity, a power of <HI>defending the innecent,</HI> and of <HI>re&s;i&s;ting evil</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion:</HI> for this is the true foundation of all <HI>ju&s;t wars,</HI> which, certainly, in the nece&s;&s;ary defence of a <HI>nation,</HI> may be carried on without the guilt of <HI>rapine</HI> and <HI>murder;</HI> &s;ince, even be|tween <HI>individuals,</HI> the <HI>inevitable killing</HI> of an adver&s;ary, in the nece&s;&s;ary defence of a man's own per&s;on, is clear|ly <HI>ju&s;tifiable</HI> in <HI>law,</HI> as well as in <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> which is the <HI>eternal</HI> law of God. And <HI>national ju&s;tice</HI> in many ca&s;es, is unque&s;tionably required to <HI>re&s;i&s;t evil,</HI> even unto <HI>blood!</HI> The blood of the murderer (i. e. of the <HI>voluntary killer of a</HI> MAN) is ab&s;olutely required to be &s;hed by MAN, (<HI>"by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed,"</HI> Gen. ix. 6.) and a moral rea&s;on is el&s;ewhere a&s;&s;igned for this retaliation by <HI>man,</HI> viz. <Q><HI>for blood it de&s;ileth the land: and the land cannot be clean&s;ed of the blood that is &s;hed therein, but by the blood of him that &s;hed it.</HI></Q> (Num. xxxv. 33.) And this, &s;urely, is a <HI>re&s;i&s;tance to evil,</HI> a retaliation of <HI>violence in kind</HI> even to the utmo&s;t extremity of <HI>violence,</HI>&mdash;to death! This, however, mu&s;t be under&s;tood only of <HI>judicial acts</HI> of retaliation, duly limited in all their circum&s;tances by the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of the <HI>community,</HI> or nation, which inhabits <HI>the land where the blood is &s;hed;</HI> but, under &s;uch due re&s;triction, the retaliation of <HI>blood</HI> for <HI>blood</HI> is &s;o far from being forbid, that the land, it is manife&s;t, cannot be <HI>clean&s;ed</HI> without it. The indi&s;criminate doc|trine, therefore, of <HI>non re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> as &s;tated in the&s;e two po&s;itions, has no foundation in &s;cripture, nor indeed any where el&s;e, except in the <HI>mi&s;under&s;tanding</HI> and inac|curacy of the&s;e <HI>&s;peculative</HI> and <HI>refined ob&s;ervers!</HI></P>
<P>I may now return to the con&s;ideration of his third po&s;ition, that <Q><HI>government is e&s;&s;ential to the nature of man, and</HI> CANNOT <HI>be managed without certain degrees of</HI> VIOLENCE, CORRUPTION, and IMPOSITION, <HI>yet all the&s;e are &s;trictly forbid.</HI></Q> The fir&s;t part of this &s;en|tence, as well as the la&s;t, mu&s;t certainly be admitted as unque&s;tionable <HI>truths;</HI> but if the middle part of the propo&s;ition were equally <HI>true;</HI> viz. that government "CANNOT <HI>be managed without violence, impo&s;ition,</HI>" &amp;c. it would follow, of cour&s;e, that the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e</HI> mu&s;t regularly &s;uper&s;ede all that is &s;o <Q><HI>&s;trictly forbid</HI></Q> concerning it! and then, indeed, the&s;e <Q><HI>&s;pe|culative</HI> and <HI>refined ob&s;ervers</HI></Q> would have a better foundation for their impious in&s;inuation, that the <HI>Crea|tor hath</HI> <Q><HI>con&s;tituted a world upon one plan, and a reli|gion for it on another!</HI></Q> Nay, I have frequently heard the&s;e very principles avowed in conver&s;ation, by &s;ome other <HI>&s;uch "friends to good government"</HI> as our author, in terms to the following effect. <Q><HI>That public bu&s;ine&s;s cannot be carried on without</HI> BRIBERY and CORRUP|TION: <HI>that the mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration are indi&s;|pen&s;ably</HI> NECESSARY <HI>to maintain due &s;ubordination and</HI> GOOD GOVERNMENT, <HI>and mu&s;t not, therefore, be im|peded by un&s;ea&s;onable negatives of parliament; &s;o that</HI> POLITICAL NECESSITY <HI>will &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify the &s;tate&s;man in exerting all po&s;&s;ible influence to obtain a majority at any rate.</HI></Q> Thus the plea of NECESSITY is introduced to <HI>palliate</HI> and excu&s;e, nay, even to <HI>ju&s;|tify</HI> and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h,</HI> the mo&s;t flagrant enormities! as if <HI>in|equity</HI> was become an e&s;&s;ential principle of government, &s;o authorized and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> by the &s;anction of <HI>general u&s;age,</HI> that every attempt to correct it mu&s;t be deemed an <HI>innovation to the con&s;titution!</HI></P>
<P>In no other point of view can be under&s;tood the falla|cious and groundle&s;s charge of INNOVATION which has regularly been oppo&s;ed to <HI>parliamentary reform,</HI> by men of <HI>a certain de&s;cription,</HI> whenever it hath been propo&s;ed. With the&s;e <HI>latitudinarians in principle,</HI> all di&s;tinctions between <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> mu&s;t be mea&s;ured by <HI>political expediency,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>government,</HI> according to them, <Q><HI>cannot be managed without certain degrees of violence, corruption, and impo&s;ition!</HI></Q> Thus the celebrated wri|ter hath very hone&s;tly &s;tated the <HI>ruling</HI> maxim of that <HI>venal majority</HI> with whom he always <HI>voted</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;ociated.</HI> And, as the&s;e <HI>"&s;peculative and refined ob&s;ervers"</HI> have carried this wretched &s;y&s;tem of <HI>political nece&s;&s;ity and ex|pediency</HI> to the utmo&s;t extent that it was capable of, I have need only to cite their own <HI>woeful experience,</HI> as a mo&s;t &s;triking and undeniable example of its ab&s;urdity!</P>
<P>The INIQUITY of the&s;e acknowledged means of <HI>"managing government,"</HI> viz. <Q><HI>violence, corruption, and impo&s;ition,</HI></Q> added to the MISCARRIAGES which &s;uch worthy <HI>mini&s;terial accompli&s;hments</HI> have of late years no|toriou&s;ly occa&s;ioned, would form too heavy a burden for one broad back! I &s;peak, therefore, of the late <HI>governing</HI> majority, in the aggregate, and &s;hall not be tempted to particularize, unle&s;s any of them &s;hould &s;till per&s;i&s;t in &s;oliciting and inviting, as it were, the national ju&s;tice again&s;t them&s;elves, for their former mi&s;conduct when in power, by any farther unrea&s;onable and <HI>pro|voking</HI> oppo&s;ition to the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>reformation.</HI></P>
<P>Under the baneful au&s;pices of the&s;e ju&s;tifying Majori|ties and their <HI>Managers,</HI> the Patrons and Friends of this writer, (with the &s;anction al&s;o of his <HI>own &s;teady vote,</HI> in all their mea&s;ures;) the mo&s;t di&s;graceful and per|nicious exce&s;s, of "<HI>violence, corruption,</HI> and <HI>impo&s;ition,</HI>" has been tried and pu&s;hed to the utmo&s;t exertions of the national &s;trength and re&s;ources; and at an expence of blood and trea&s;ure, far beyond all example of former times!</P>
<P>And yet the dete&s;table <HI>experiment</HI> has notoriou&s;ly failed in almo&s;t every circum&s;tance propo&s;ed to be effected by it, and, in&s;tead of <HI>rai&s;ing a revenue,</HI> to gratify and ea&s;e <HI>"the country gentlemen,"</HI> has <HI>&s;unk</HI> the national re&s;ources in a hopele&s;s <HI>gulph of debt,</HI> the very intere&s;t of which is an <HI>annual</HI> expence of more than the value of an em|pire! i. e. <HI>a revenue, by the rule of inver&s;e, again&s;t</HI> the &s;tate, like the <HI>"negative quantity"</HI> of the algebrai&s;ts, <HI>"le&s;s than nothing,"</HI> a <HI>"minus"</HI> of eight millions per annum, at lea&s;t, be&s;ides a mo&s;t di&s;graceful di&s;member|ment of the Briti&s;h empire! So much for the EXPE|RIENCE of the <HI>"&s;peculative and refined ob&s;ervers."</HI></P>

<P>In the 33d chapter, al&s;o, the prophet again repeat|edly reproves their impious &s;uppo&s;ition of an <HI>inequality</HI> in the <HI>ways</HI> of the <HI>Creator,</HI> which appears to have been e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame with the <HI>Dei&s;tical</HI> propo&s;ition of our <HI>"refined ob&s;ervers,"</HI> about <Q><HI>a world upon one plan, and a religion for it on another.</HI></Q> See ver&s;es 17 to 29. <Q><HI>Yet the children of thy people &s;ay, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them,</HI></Q> (&s;aid the prophet &s;peaking of the <HI>"&s;peculative refined ob&s;ervers"</HI> of that day,) <Q><HI>their way is not equal.

O ye hou&s;e of I&s;rael, I will judge you every one after his ways.</HI></Q> And a little farther, in the &s;ame chapter, the prophet is charged with a &s;olemn appeal to them, concerning the <HI>improbability</HI> of their being permitted to continue in <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their country,</HI> if they continued their dete&s;ta|ble practices of <HI>violence,</HI> &amp;c. in direct oppo&s;ition to the <HI>plan; religion,</HI> and <HI>laws,</HI> of the Creator! <Q><HI>Wherefore &s;ay ye unto them, thus &s;aith the</HI> LORD GOD; <HI>Ye eat with the blood,</HI></Q> (a practice expre&s;sly forbid under the <HI>patri|archal</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> as well as the <HI>Mo&s;aic,</HI> di&s;pen&s;ations,) <Q><HI>and lift up your eyes toward your idols

And that the word SCANIOS, or SCANDIOS, was really intended, is manife&s;t from the context (two pages farther) wherein expre&s;s mention is made of K. <HI>Arthur</HI>'s conque&s;t of <HI>Scantia</HI> and <HI>Gutland,</HI> the countries from whence proceeded the mo&s;t of Arthur's enemies, even the <HI>Saxons</HI> them&s;elves originally, (&s;ee Sheringham de Anglorum Gentis Origine,) if not the <HI>Picts</HI> al&s;o, the very nations mentioned by Mr. Prynne him&s;elf, and al&s;o by all the authors to whom he has appealed.</P>
<P>There is ju&s;t &s;uch another <HI>mere literal</HI> mi&s;take, a few pages farther, which, without proper warning, might &s;till farther induce a &s;uperficial reader to &s;u&s;pect the au|thenticity of the exemplar; I mean the pa&s;&s;age where mention is made of the election of king Ina, viz. <Q><HI>qui electus &s;uit in regem per</HI> ANGELUM,</Q> <Q><HI>who was elected king through</HI></Q> (or by means of) "AN ANGEL, (a very improbable circum&s;tance,) in&s;tead of the obvious meaning of the original writer, i. e. "<HI>per</HI> ANGLIAM" "<HI>throughout</HI> ENGLAND." For, this latter &s;en&s;e is clear|ly &s;upported by the context immediately following, which relates, that <Q><HI>Ina fir&s;t obtained the monarchy of this</HI> WHOLE KINGDOM,</Q> &amp;c. <Q><HI>et qui</HI> PRIMO <HI>obtinuit monarchiam</HI> TOTIUS REGNI HUJUS <HI>po&s;t adventum</HI> AN|GLORUM <HI>in Brytanniam.</HI> PRIMUS <HI>enim fuit rex co|ronatus</HI> ANGLORUM ET BRYTONUM SIMUL MANEN|TIUM IN BRITANNIA <HI>po&s;t adventum Saxonum,</HI></Q> &amp;c.

Edward's laws, with|out the lea&s;t animadver&s;ion of the publi&s;hers to clear the original compilers, and their work, from the di&s;credit of &s;uch improbable circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Mr. Prynne's objection to the antiqui|ty of the <HI>hundred</HI> courts, as declared in this addition to K. Edward's laws, viz. that <HI>"Arthur found this law," "Hanc legem invenit Arthurus," &amp;c.</HI> "and &s;o" (by means thereof) <Q><HI>united and confederated the whole king|dom of Britain into one,</HI></Q> (et ita con&s;olidavit et confoe|deravit regnum Britanniae univer&s;um &s;emper in unum;) and that <Q><HI>by virtue of</HI> THIS LAW <HI>the &s;aid Arthur drove the</HI> SCANTIANS (or Scandinavinians) <HI>and enemies out of the kingdom,</HI></Q> &amp;c. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that Mr. Prynne has a&s;&s;igned nothing but <HI>negative evidence</HI> again&s;t the fact, which is by no means &s;ufficient to di&s;prove it. On the other hand, as <HI>Arthur</HI> did really &s;ucceed in <HI>uniting</HI> and <HI>&s;trengthening</HI> the kingdom again&s;t his <HI>enemies,</HI> the other part of the &s;entence is the more probable, (that <Q><HI>he found this law,</HI></Q>) becau&s;e he certainly could not have pur|&s;ued a more effectual and &s;peedy means of re&s;toring a divided and weakened kingdom than by reviving and enforcing <HI>"this law,"</HI> which he is &s;aid to have <HI>found;</HI> and, had he been as careful, <HI>after his &s;ucce&s;s, to maintain "this law,"</HI> and to e&s;tabli&s;h it in the countries which he conquered, with <HI>free</HI> and <HI>equal</HI> liberty to all the inhabitants, the happy effects of his &s;ucce&s;s would not have had &s;o &s;hort a duration.</P>

Deut. xxix. 10. <HI>Ye &s;tand this day all of you before the Lord your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers.</HI> Again, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;ays, Deut. xxxi. 28. <HI>Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your offi|cers.</HI> And we find <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> when he was <HI>old and &s;tricken in age,</HI> Jo&s;hua xxiii. 2. <HI>called for all</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>So when <HI>David</HI> calls together the <HI>great congrega|tion</HI> to declare his purpo&s;e about the building of the temple, 1 Chron. xxviii. 1. we read of <HI>the captains over the thou&s;ands, and the captains over the hundreds, with the officers,</HI> being &s;ummoned upon that occa&s;ion. And, afterwards, we are told that <HI>Solomon</HI> made a &s;peech <HI>unto all</HI> I&s;rael, 2 Chron. i. 2. <HI>to the captains of thou|&s;ands, and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>the chief of the fathers.</HI> And thus, when that pious prince <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was re&s;olved upon a reformation both of religion and manners, throughout his kingdom, it is &s;aid, 2 Chron. xxix. 20. <HI>Then</HI> Hezekiah <HI>the king ro&s;e early, and gathered the ru|lers of the city, and went up to the hou&s;e of the Lord.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>As to their judiciary capacity, they were not, &s;trict|ly &s;peaking, judges them&s;elves, but had the power of admitting what cau&s;es they thought were proper to come before the judges, and of rejecting what they looked upon as frivolous or unnece&s;&s;ary to be enqui|red into. * * * * * *</Q></P>
<P><Q>Of the judiciary authority of the&s;e rulers, we read farther in the ca&s;e of <HI>Jeremiah.</HI> When (another) <HI>Micaiah</HI> had heard his prophetical denunciations again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> Jer. xxxvi. 11. he went down <HI>into the king's hou&s;e, into the &s;cribe's chamber, where all the princes</HI> (the&s;e rulers) <HI>were &s;itting,</HI> and inform|ed them of it. And after, when <HI>Jeremiah</HI> was going out of the city into the land of Benjamin, <HI>Irijah,</HI> who &s;u&s;pected that he was going to de&s;ert to the army of the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> who were lately broken up from be&s;ieging the city, Jer. xxxvii. 12. <HI>took</HI> Jeremiah <HI>and brought him to the princes. Wherefore the princes were wroth with</HI> Jeremiah, <HI>and &s;mote him, and put him in pri&s;on.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>And upon his farther prophe&s;ying that <HI>the city &s;hould be given into the band of the king of</HI> Babylon, <HI>Therefore the princes &s;aid unto the king, We be&s;eech thee, let this man be put to death. Then</HI> Zedekiah <HI>the king &s;aid, Behold he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do any thing again&s;t you.</HI> Which &s;hews that they bore a mighty &s;way in the <HI>great council</HI> of the nation; and that, when they prayed judgement and execution again&s;t any one, even the king thought it mo&s;t &s;afe and prudent to comply with them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The number of the&s;e <HI>rulers,</HI> in every city, was in proportion to the number of its inhabitants; as many <HI>thou&s;ands</HI> as it contained, &s;o many <HI>rulers,</HI> of that rank and denomination, belonged to it; from which re|gulation, the e&s;timation and con&s;equence of each city was di&s;cernible at one view. And from this con&s;ideration ari&s;es that fine allu&s;ion of one of the pro|phets concerning the place where Chri&s;t &s;hould be born; &s;o under&s;tood and applied by <HI>the chief prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>&s;cribes</HI> them&s;elves, as the Evangeli&s;t informs us. Mat. ii. 5. Mic. v. 2. <HI>But thou,</HI> Bethlehem Ephratah, <HI>though thou be little among the thou&s;ands of</HI> Judah, (in compari&s;on of tho&s;e cities that have <HI>rulers of thou&s;ands</HI> belonging to them,) <HI>yet out of thee he &s;hall come forth unto me, that is, to be ruler in</HI> I&s;rael; <HI>who&s;e goings forth have been of old, from everla&s;ting.</HI> So exactly was almo&s;t every minute circum&s;tance, relating to the Sa|viour of mankind, delineated and foretold by tho&s;e divinely-in&s;pired writers, who lived &s;o many hun|dred years before he came into the world. * *</Q></P>
<P>Captains of Thou&s;ands, &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>The re&s;t of the officers that governed the army we find called by the titles of <HI>captains of thou&s;ands, cap|tains of hundreds, captains of fifties, and captains of tens.</HI> Who probably were of the &s;ame rank with tho&s;e whom <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> con&s;tituted, in the wilderne&s;s, <HI>rulers of thou&s;ands,</HI> &amp;c. and, at fir&s;t, acted in a double capa|city, being at the &s;ame time civil magi&s;trates and military officers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>captains of thou&s;ands</HI> &s;eem to have been much the &s;ame as colonels of regiments with us; and the <HI>captains of hundreds</HI> might probably an&s;wer to tho&s;e who, in our army, have the command of troops and companies; the <HI>captains of fifties</HI> and <HI>tens,</HI> to our &s;u|balterns, &s;erjeants and corporals.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Among the li&s;t of <HI>David</HI>'s adherents while he fled from <HI>Saul,</HI> 1 Chron. xii. 1.14. and <HI>kept him&s;elf clo&s;e at</HI> Ziklag; after &s;everal names mentioned, it is &s;aid; <HI>The&s;e were of the &s;ons of God, captains of the ho&s;t: one of the lea&s;t was over an hundred, and the greate&s;t over a thou&s;and.</HI> Again, we read of others &s;aid, 1 Chron. xii. 20. to be <HI>captains of the thou&s;ands that were of</HI> Mana&s;&s;eh. And, when <HI>David</HI> had thoughts of bring|ing the <HI>Ark of God</HI> from <HI>Kirjathjearim,</HI> we are told, 1 Chron. xiii. 1. he <HI>con&s;ulted with the captains of thou|&s;ands, and hundreds, and with every leader.</HI> And again, when he declared his intentions about build|ing the temple, it is &s;aid that he, 1 Chron. xxviii. 1. <HI>a&s;&s;embled all the princes of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that mini&s;tered to the king by cour&s;e, and the captains over the thou&s;ands, and the captains over the hundreds.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>So when <HI>Jehoiada</HI> the high-prie&s;t had a mind to bring on the re&s;toration, by declaring <HI>Joa&s;h</HI> to be king, 2 Kings xi. 4. <HI>he &s;ent for the rulers over hundreds, with the captains, and the guard, and &s;hewed them the king's &s;on;</HI> and gave them proper in&s;tructions what they were to do. <HI>And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that</HI> Jehoiada <HI>the prie&s;t com|manded. And to the captains over hundreds did the prie&s;t give king</HI> David<HI>'s &s;pears and &s;hields, that were in the temple of the Lord. And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land, and they brought down the king from the hou&s;e of the Lord, and be &s;ate on the throne of the kings.</HI> And we read, 2 Kings i. 9, 11, 13. of <HI>three captains of fifties,</HI> who, with their fifties, were &s;ent &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by <HI>Ahaziah,</HI> king of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> to bring the prophet <HI>Elijah</HI> to him. The Apocryphal writings tell us, 1 Mac. iii. 55. that <HI>Judas ordained captains over the peo|ple, even captains over thou&s;ands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e officers, from the <HI>captain of the ho&s;t</HI> down to the lowe&s;t &s;ubaltern, appear, after the monarchy took place, to have received their commi&s;&s;ions from the king.</Q> (Whereas they were before cho&s;en by the people.) <Q>When <HI>Samuel</HI> declares to the people the <HI>manner</HI> of the king that was to reign over them, this is part of it; 1 Sam. viii. 12. <HI>he will appoint him cap|tains over thou&s;ands, and captains over fifties,</HI> &amp;c. Ac|cordingly when <HI>Saul</HI> began to grow jealous of <HI>David</HI>'s ri&s;ing glory, 1 Sam. xviii. 13. <HI>he removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thou&s;and.</HI> So we read, 2 Sam. xviii. 1. that <HI>David numbered the people that were with him, and &s;et captains of thou&s;ands, and captains of hundreds over them.</HI> 2 Chron. xxv. 5. and that <HI>Amaziah gathered</HI> Judah <HI>together, and made them captains over thou&s;ands, and captains over hundreds.</HI></Q></P></NOTE> in

<P><Q>All the decennaries or tithingmen were <HI>cho&s;en by the people</HI> once a-year; and this is an <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> circum|&s;tance in the in&s;titution.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The ten tithingmen of every di&s;trict, called a hun|dred becau&s;e it contained a hundred families, cho&s;e a per&s;on to pre&s;ide over the hundred, to whom they made their appeals, and who had a power of calling them out. All the&s;e were amenable to the earl or count who governed the county; and he was amenable to the king, who either by the <HI>earl or by the &s;heriff, both of which were of his own appointment</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The worthy author in this point is mi&s;taken: the &s;heriff, as well as the earl and <HI>heretock,</HI> were, in ancient times, <HI>cho&s;en by the people.</HI></NOTE>, could call out the whole force of a county, or of any number of counties, as the public exigencies required; while the internal peace and order of each di&s;trict was pro|vided for without his interference, and in a manner perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with his general authority and in|fluence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nothing has ever been imagined more &s;imple in its con&s;truction, or more effectual in the execution, than this part of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. The &s;everal powers of it, which in mo&s;t ca&s;es are in eternal di&s;|cord, are here &s;o happily blended, that the people are &s;ecure and free; the king's power extends to every thing but mi&s;chief, and is, in reality, greater than can be obtained on any other plan.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e regulations might be ea&s;ily re&s;tored and ren|dered as effectual as ever. The prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the people are &s;trongly in their favour; and, perhaps, no others can be contrived which will not &s;et the body of the people <HI>at enmity</HI> with government; which will perfectly allay their apprehen&s;ions and jealou&s;ies; will make them the mini&s;ters of their own &s;ecurity, while the power of the king <HI>reaches every individual of them, by a chain, every link of which is effectual,</HI> and <HI>will not interfere with the prerogative of the king in other departments of the &s;tate,</HI> however the bu&s;ine&s;s of them may be admini&s;tered. * * * *</Q></P>
<P>"If you mean that it is impracticable," (&s;ays he, in letter III.) <Q>becau&s;e the inhabitants of this country are too far advanced in luxury, too indolent, too effemi|nate, to enter on any plan of &s;ecurity, which will re|quire the lea&s;t trouble, or put them to the lea&s;t incon|venience; and if you can a&s;certain this fact, I have no an&s;wer to make. But the trouble and inconve|nience are &s;uch as would not be complained of by women. What is it but an amu&s;ement to learn the common u&s;e of arms? What inconvenience to &s;ub|mit to &s;uch regulations as may bring together a neigh|bourhood, a pari&s;h, the ward of a city, a town, a di&s;trict, &amp;c. to clear them of vagabonds, occa&s;ionally to a&s;&s;i&s;t the civil magi&s;trate, and to lay the ba&s;is of a general &s;ecurity, confidence, and &s;trength, where it ought to be laid, in the whole body of the people?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I will venture to affirm, that there is no other me|thod by which di&s;turbances, riots, and in&s;urrections, can be prevented, without deba&s;ing the people into the condition of brutes: and there is no other me|thod by which a king may hold every man in the na|tion in his hands; while every man in the nation would feel and know him&s;elf to be as free as it is po&s;|&s;ible he &s;hould be in &s;ociety.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hints have been thrown out of acts of parliament which render &s;uch a&s;&s;ociations, as I recommend, ille|gal; but the acts are not &s;pecified. I know there are laws forbidding a man's going armed, in a time of tranquillity and peace, without leave from a magi&s;|trate, and &s;pecifying &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies of people as are dangerous and &s;editious; but without the mo&s;t di&s;|tant reference to the right which every man has, from nature, from the connivance of the mo&s;t de&s;potic go|vernments, and from the expre&s;s provi&s;ions of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, to provide for his own defence and that of his family; and to unite with his neigh|bourhood, under the eye and direction of the &s;upreme magi&s;trate, for the general peace and order of the community.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If there were &s;uch laws as you mention, they could not po&s;&s;ibly have effect, again&s;t not only <HI>a nece&s;&s;ary right or nature, but an e&s;&s;ential principle of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution.</HI> If a law were made, that, becau&s;e it is <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> an Engli&s;h elector may become venal, there|fore all electors mu&s;t relinqui&s;h the right of voting,&mdash; would this con&s;titute an obligation? Will any man &s;ay, that the legi&s;lature is competent to the making of &s;uch a law?&mdash;how much le&s;s to annihilate the fir&s;t and mo&s;t important principles of human &s;ociety, by awarding, that, as it is po&s;&s;ible men may make an improper u&s;e of their limbs, or their arms, which may be as nece&s;&s;ary as their limbs, they mu&s;t therefore &s;uffer them to be <HI>taken off.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The power of the legi&s;lature, like every power in human &s;ociety, is limited by certain and accurate bounds; it may exceed the&s;e bounds, and commit ab&s;urdities, and even offences. The Engli&s;h legi&s;|lature is ju&s;t as competent to make a law, by which every Engli&s;hman may be bani&s;hed to the Orkneys, or put to death, as it is to enjoin the people to give up the right of &s;elf-defence and pre&s;ervation, by the u&s;e of their limbs, or by the u&s;e of arms.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The apprehen&s;ion that a&s;&s;ociations will produce commotions and riots, in&s;tead of preventing them, mu&s;t be pretended only. And all the arguments for depriving the people of the right of a&s;&s;ociating, be|cau&s;e they have often a&s;&s;embled for mi&s;chievous pur|po&s;es, are delu&s;ive. Cardinal de Retz &s;ays, that all numerous a&s;&s;emblies are mobs; and I will add, that all mobs are mi&s;chievous. Let the people, who might form &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies, <HI>be divided into &s;mall bo|dies; and, though the individuals be not improved, they will act rea&s;onably and well.</HI> The de&s;ign of a&s;&s;ocia|tions is, to <HI>prevent large and tumultuous a&s;&s;emblies; to arrange the people under the eye of government,</HI> as accu|rately as an army, <HI>without dimini&s;hing their con&s;titutional independence and liberty;</HI> to increa&s;e the difficulty of mi&s;leading them, and to de&s;troy all ideas of <HI>appeals to them.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Here I beg to be under&s;tood, not as aiming at any of the rights of the people: but the idea of an <HI>appeal to them</HI> has been borrowed from the government of <HI>Rome;</HI> in England it is, like the introduction of mi|litary force, a thing that negligence or mi&s;manage|ment may render <HI>nece&s;&s;ary;</HI> but the con&s;titution is perfect without it; no &s;uppo&s;ition is made of the po&s;|&s;ibility of having any occa&s;ion to make it; and, when|ever it is made, the remedy may be as hazardous as any evil it can be de&s;igned to remove. A whole nation, like the human body, in order to act with harmony and plea&s;ure, <HI>mu&s;t be divided into &s;mall parts, each having its local power, &s;ubject to the direction and controul of the general will,</HI></Q> p. 38 to 44.</P></NOTE> be duly adopted; and this

<HEAD TYPE="sub">An ea&s;y and practicable Plan for laying out Settlements on uncultivated Lands, in e|qual Divi&s;ions of <HI>ten Tithings,</HI> or 100 Families each; whereby new Colonies may be mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly formed and extended in regular Di&s;tricts of <HI>Hun|dreds,</HI> agreeable to the ancient legal Di|vi&s;ions of our Anglo-Saxon Ance&s;tors.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="285" REF="281">
SEVERAL years ago I made &s;ome me|morandums of <Q><HI>A Method of form|ing frontier Settlements,</HI></Q> which I co|pied from the &s;econd edition of a book fir&s;t printed at Philadelphia, but reprinted at London in 1766, and intituled <Q><HI>An Hi&s;torical Account of the Expedition again&s;t the Ohio Indians, in the Year</HI> 1764, <HI>under the Command of Henry Bouquet, E&s;q. to which are annexed Military Papers, containing Reflections on the War with the Savages; a Method of forming frontier Settlements,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> My reference for the la&s;t-mentioned &s;ub|ject is to p. 51 of the &s;aid book; but, as I have not the book it&s;elf at pre&s;ent, I cannot pretend to be perfectly accurate in my quotations from it; neither do I re|member
<PB N="286" REF="282">whether the author recommend|ed a government by <HI>tithing</HI> and <HI>hundred</HI> courts, with their proper officers, accord|ing to the Anglo-Saxon model; but only that his propo&s;ed &s;ettlements were (happily for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e) laid out in equal divi&s;ions of <HI>one hundred</HI> lots each, for the maintenance of <HI>one hundred</HI> families; &s;o that, of cour&s;e, the con&s;titutional regu|lations for <HI>hundreds,</HI> recommended in the preceding tracts, will not be le&s;s &s;uitable and beneficial to <HI>his</HI> &s;cheme than <HI>his</HI> certainly is to mine.</P>
<P>"Let us &s;uppo&s;e a &s;ettlement" (&s;ays he) <Q>to be formed for <HI>one hundred fa|milies,</HI> compo&s;ed of five per&s;ons each upon an average.</Q></P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>Lay out upon a river or creek, a &s;qu. of 1760 yards; or a mile for each &s;ide.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That &s;quare will contain 640 acres.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Allowance for &s;treets and public u&s;es 40 640 acres.</ITEM>
<ITEM>To half an acre for every hou&s;e 50 640 acres.</ITEM>
<ITEM>To 100 lots at 5&frac12; acres 550 640 acres.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P><Q>The four &s;ides of the &s;quare mea|&s;ures 7040 yards, which gives to each
<PB N="287" REF="283">hou&s;e about 70 yards in front, to &s;toc|kade, and the ground, allowed for building, will be 210 feet front and about 100 feet deep.</Q></P>
<P><Q>An acre of ground will produce at lea&s;t 30 bu&s;hels of Indian corn; there|fore, two acres are &s;ufficient to &s;upply five per&s;ons at the rate of 12 bu&s;hels each per&s;on; two other acres will be for cows and &s;heep, another for hay, or to be &s;own with red clover; the re|maining half acre may be laid out for a garden.</Q> Thus far the author's plan may be applicable to lands even in England, e&s;pecially if laid out in le&s;s divi&s;ions of <HI>tithings,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>hundreds,</HI> pre&s;erving the &s;ame due proportion of land in lots for each family. The <HI>ten</HI> fa|milies with their habitations would form a compact little village, under the govern|ment of a <HI>tithing-man,</HI> annually elected from among them&s;elves, whereby all
<PB N="288" REF="284">would be rendered mutually re&s;pon&s;ible for each other, for the common peace; and to make good every damage that might be occa&s;ioned by the ill behaviour of any individual among them. An e&s;tate laid out in &s;mall farms, with &s;uch a <HI>tithing</HI> village in the centre of it, for a con&s;tant &s;upply of labourers, might be made to maintain a much greater number of peo|ple than land generally does in the ordi|nary way of farming; and would, con&s;e|quently, be much more beneficial both to the landlords and to the nation at large. Commons and wa&s;te fore&s;ts or cha&s;es might thus be laid out and occupied by the labouring poor, to the great reduction of pari&s;h rates as well as of the price of labour; for, free and u&s;eful labourers would never be wanting, if &s;uch a regular provi&s;ion, under their own management could be found for their families. But the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch pari&s;h-lots &s;hould
<PB N="289" REF="285">be limited to tho&s;e per&s;ons, who occupy no other land; and &s;hould be delivered up to the pari&s;h or community, for the u&s;e of other unprovided families, as &s;oon as any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or obtains more land, either as a farm, or in fee, (as recommended in a former Tract,) to prevent <HI>the monopoly of land,</HI> and the entire deprivation of the poor from any &s;hare in it, as at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The remainder of the author's &s;cheme is &s;uitable only to unoccupied countries, like many parts of Africa and America, where the people are few, and the lands of &s;mall value, viz. "Round the town" (&s;ays he) <Q>are the commons of three miles &s;quare, containing, exclu&s;ive of the lots above-mentioned, 5120 acres. On three &s;ides of the town, five other &s;quares will be laid out, of three &s;quare miles, containing 5760 acres each; one of which is re&s;erved for wood, for the u&s;e of the &s;ettlement; the other four
<PB N="290" REF="286">to be divided into 25 out-lots, or plan|tations, of about 230 acres each; &s;o that in the four &s;quares there will be 100 &s;uch plantations, for the 100 fa|milies. Another town&s;hip may be laid out joining this, upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame plan, and as many more as you plea&s;e, upon the &s;ame line, without lo&s;ing any ground.</Q></P>
<P>The following is a rough Sketch of the whole.</P>

<P><PB N="292" REF="288">The banks of the river (as in ancient times) &s;hould be deemed <HI>common</HI> or <HI>public</HI> as the river it&s;elf, under the con&s;ervation of the <HI>community;</HI> and &s;hould be re&s;erved for future improvements, (as for the ac|commodation, not only of fi&s;hermen, but al&s;o of manufacturers, traders, and of all indu&s;trious &s;trangers,) and docks, or navi|gable cuts (whenever the level of the country will permit) &s;hould be made from the river, as far back, at lea&s;t, as the centre between every two town&s;hips.</P>
<P>The &s;paces between the &s;quares are left for roads and common communications between the &s;everal lots; and the roads which divide two di&s;tinct town&s;hips &s;hould be &s;till more &s;pacious for the common u&s;e of all the inhabitants, the cartage of their produce and other traffic, the dri|ving of cattle, &amp;c. and a &s;pacious road, to be formed lengthways throughout the whole &s;ettlement, ought, in forming the
<PB N="293" REF="289">lots, to be re&s;erved through the centre of each town&s;hip: the central lots, which will thereby be dimini&s;hed in <HI>&s;ize,</HI> will find ample compen&s;ation, in <HI>value,</HI> by their &s;ituation on the great central road, which I have expre&s;&s;ed by a dotted line.

<P>I would likewi&s;e deviate from the ori|ginal plan of the author, with re&s;pect to the &s;ituation of the 5760 acres of wood|land for each town&s;hip; which, I con|ceive, had better be re&s;erved in one of the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;quares, at an angular &s;ituation from each town, in&s;tead of being in the oppo&s;ite &s;quare, according to his propo&s;al: for the towns will not only be more healthy, by having the uncleared lands more di&s;tant from them, but al&s;o the inhabitants, when on watch and ward duty, will be better enabled to di&s;cover
<PB N="294" REF="290">the approach of any lurking &s;avages, or other enemies in time of war.</P>

<P>Thus it appears that the conque&s;t of <HI>Ireland</HI> by King Edgar did not affect the ju&s;t liberties of the <HI>church of Ireland;</HI> for the <HI>Norman</HI> colonies therein &s;till enjoyed the uninfluenced <HI>election</HI> of their own Bi&s;hops: and though they acknowledged the juri&s;diction of the pro|vince of Canterbury in <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters,</HI> even when they were become <HI>independent,</HI> and &s;eparated from us, under a King of their own, yet that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was per|fectly <HI>voluntary</HI> and <HI>free,</HI> and was continued for no other rea&s;on than becau&s;e they had originally received <HI>epi&s;co|pal ordination</HI> from the Archbi&s;hops of that &s;ee. Never|thele&s;s they declared them&s;elves at liberty to receive con&s;ecration from the Archbi&s;hop of Armagh, and other Iri&s;h Bi&s;hops, (who earne&s;tly de&s;ired to confer it on them.) in ca&s;e the prelates of Canterbury &s;hould be negligent in their &s;uperintendency. And the Bi&s;hops al&s;o of the <HI>native Iri&s;h</HI> and their flocks were equally free and inde|pendent in <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters,</HI> having pre&s;erved a due &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the &s;acred order of epi&s;copacy from the early times of their <HI>fir&s;t</HI> conver&s;ion (<HI>before</HI> the time of the <HI>fir&s;t Patrick</HI>) down to the barbarous times of our K. Henry II. who invaded their i&s;land, under the delu&s;ive &s;anction of a <HI>papal commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> to compel the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>church of Ireland</HI> to the juri&s;diction and doctrines of the <HI>church of Rome,</HI> and to pay an annual tribute to the pope of one penny for every hou&s;e; and all this on the delu&s;ive pretence of <HI>in&s;tructing</HI> the Iri&s;h, <HI>reforming their manners,</HI> &amp;c. Henry obtained his fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ion for the&s;e pur|po&s;es from pope Adrian IV. A. D. 1155, which Arch|bi&s;hop U&s;her has in&s;erted in his &s;aid collection of an|cient epi&s;tles, p. 109. And he informs us, in p. 152. (from <HI>Trivettus,</HI>) that Henry treated with his parliament at Winche&s;ter concerning the <HI>conque&s;t of Ireland,</HI> but, be|cau&s;e it did not plea&s;e his mother the empre&s;s, that ex|pedition was po&s;tponed to another time.

<P>Afterwards, however, in the year 1172, Pope Alex|ander III. revived the former wicked and pre&s;umptuous grant of Adrian, for invading and u&s;urping the <HI>temporal rights</HI> as well as &s;piritual juri&s;diction of the <HI>clergy and people of Ireland,</HI> (whereby "<HI>the dominion of the Iri&s;h kingdom was</HI> INDULGED <HI>to</HI>" Henry,) and, in the pleni|tude of his <HI>unlimited</HI> and <HI>unlawful</HI> power, this <Q><HI>man of &s;in,</HI></Q> <GAP DESC="foreign">, pre&s;umptuou&s;ly ratified and confirmed

His opi|nion &s;eems to have been built principally on a peculiar explanation of the word <HI>ordination.</HI> "That <HI>ordination,</HI>" (&s;ays he,) <Q>that I &s;hall &s;peak of, is this, the grant of a peculiar commi&s;&s;ion and power, which remains inde|lible in the per&s;on to whom it is committed, and can never be obliterated or ra&s;ed out, except the per&s;on him&s;elf cau&s;e it by his here&s;ie, apo&s;tacy, or mo&s;t ex|tremely gro&s;s and &s;candalous impiety.</Q> (Thus far there is no need to oppo&s;e his &s;en&s;e of <HI>ordination;</HI> but he adds,) "Now this &s;ort of <HI>ordination</HI>" (&s;ays he) <Q>was conferred <HI>only upon Deacons and Pre&s;byters,</HI> or <HI>on Dea|cons and Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters and Bi&s;hops being here to be con&s;idered as all one,</HI> as Mini&s;ters of the church univer|&s;al,</Q> p. 115. This appears to be the key-&s;tone, whereby the whole fabric of the doctrine throughout his work is &s;u&s;pended and held up, and con&s;equently, the whole building mu&s;t fall by the removal of it! Very happily, for the determination of the di&s;pute, he has pro|duced (within a few pages after the place from whence this quotation was taken) &s;ome clear and unque&s;tionable examples of the <HI>ordination</HI> of &s;ome per&s;ons to the degree of <HI>Pre&s;byters,</HI> who really <HI>were not Bi&s;hops,</HI> and never had <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> dignity in the ordinary eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>epi&s;copal,</HI> &s;o that they could not, con&s;i&s;tently with truth, <HI>"be con&s;idered as all one"</HI> with <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> according to this learned writer's hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>He cites (in p. 133.) the expre&s;s te&s;timony of Eu&s;ebius for the <HI>ordination</HI> of ORIGEN to be a <HI>Pre&s;byter,</HI> <Q>that the Bi&s;hops of Cae&s;area and Jeru&s;alem <HI>ordained</HI></Q> (or laid hands upon) <HI>"him into the pre&s;bytery,"</HI> i. e. to make <HI>him a Pre&s;byter,</HI> <Q><GAP DESC="foreign">,</Q> Eu&s;eb. lib. 6. c. 8. p. 209. Here then is a clear proof of the ordination of a per&s;on to be a <HI>Pre&s;byter,</HI> by the hands of <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and yet no man, that has any regard to the te&s;timony and truth of eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, will pre&s;ume to &s;ay that <HI>Origen</HI> was a <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> though he was unque&s;tionably or|dained to be a <HI>Pre&s;byter;</HI> and, con&s;equently, it cannot be true, that the ordination of "<HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI>" is <HI>"to be con&s;idered as all one."</HI></P>
<P>By another quotation, in p. 135, from Eu&s;ebius, this learned writer proves al&s;o that <Q><HI>Novatian was ordained a</HI> PRESBYTER <HI>by impo&s;ition of hands,</HI></Q> i.e. the hands of a BISHOP, as Eu&s;ebius declares: <GAP DESC="foreign">. Cornel. apud Eu&s;eb. lib. 6. cap. 43. p. 245.</P>
<P>And that this is a clear example of <HI>the ordination of a mere Pre&s;byter,</HI> manife&s;tly di&s;tinct from <HI>ordination to the epi&s;copal dignity,</HI> is demon&s;trated by the &s;ame chapter of Eu&s;ebius, which relates the wicked fraud of <HI>this &s;ame Pre&s;byter,</HI> Novatian, at a time when he was already a <HI>Pre&s;byter,</HI> to obtain a <HI>farther ordination</HI> for the <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> dignity, by inveigling three &s;imple country Bi&s;hops to <HI>ordain him a Bi&s;hop</HI> by the impo&s;ition of their hands. And therefore, though <HI>all Bi&s;hops</HI> are certainly <HI>Pre&s;by|ters,</HI> yet the&s;e examples, cited by the learned writer, clearly demon&s;trate that <HI>all Pre&s;byters are</HI> NOT <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and, con&s;equently, that their <HI>ordination</HI> is NOT <Q><HI>to be con&s;idered as all one.</HI></Q> The rite of ordination (i. e. <HI>the laying on of hands by the Bi&s;hops, after &s;olemn prayer of the whole congregation for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Spirit</HI>) is, indeed, <HI>"all one,"</HI> as well in the ordaining of <HI>Dea|cons,</HI> as in the ordination of <HI>Pre&s;byters,</HI> and in the con|&s;ecration of Bi&s;hops, differing only in the <HI>de&s;ignation</HI> to the&s;e re&s;pective offices of the Chri&s;tian Mini&s;try, as I have already remarked in p. 316 n; but then this &s;ingle circum&s;tance of <HI>de&s;ignation</HI> is &s;ufficiently effectual to occa&s;ion an <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> difference in the three degrees of holy <HI>orders;</HI> for what are <HI>orders</HI> but <HI>de&s;ignations,</HI> or de|clarations of the office conferred, or function to be di&s;|charged? in&s;omuch that a per&s;on who hath been duly ordained by the <HI>&s;ame &s;olemn rite,</HI> with a <HI>de&s;ignation</HI> to the office of a <HI>Deacon,</HI> may not a&s;&s;ume the office of a <HI>Pre&s;byter,</HI> without a <HI>repetition of that rite,</HI> and an expre&s;s <HI>order,</HI> or <HI>de&s;ignation,</HI> to the office and duty of a <HI>Pre&s;byter;</HI> and a <HI>Pre&s;byter,</HI> who has <HI>twice</HI> received holy <HI>orders</HI> by the &s;ame &s;olemn rite, cannot lawfully a&s;&s;ume the dignity and office of a Bi&s;hop, until he hath been <HI>fir&s;t</HI> duly <HI>elected to be a Bi&s;hop;</HI> and, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> (which is the <HI>mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential</HI> circum&s;tance, by which <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> authority is really con|ferred,) until he have been once more <HI>ordered,</HI> or <HI>ordain|ed,</HI> (notwith&s;tanding his two former <HI>orders,</HI> as a Deacon, and as a <HI>Pre&s;byter,</HI>) and that with a repetition of the <HI>&s;ame &s;olemn rite,</HI> (the laying on of hands with previous pray|er,) but differing in this, that there is always an expre&s;s <HI>order,</HI> or <HI>de&s;ignation,</HI> to the <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> function, previous to the prayers and laying on of hands. The example of <HI>Novatian,</HI> cited above, &s;hews that the <HI>re-ordination</HI> of <HI>Pre&s;byters,</HI> in order to obtain the degree and function of a <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> was <HI>deemed nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> even early in the third century. Other examples, which I have quoted in pages 340-342 n. concerning the <HI>re-ordination</HI> of <HI>Pre&s;|byters</HI> that had been <HI>elected</HI> to be <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> prove that the &s;ame opinion as well as <HI>practice</HI> was pre&s;erved in the middle centuries of Chri&s;tianity; and the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> uni|ver&s;al practice of the epi&s;copal church, in giving <HI>prie&s;ts orders</HI> always previous to <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> con&s;ecration, is too well known and e&s;tabli&s;hed, to need the citation of par|ticular examples for illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>The learned Chancellor (if he was the writer of the &s;aid book) hath al&s;o <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> that the petition of a <HI>candidate for holy orders</HI> <Q>was to the whole Pre&s;bytery, becau&s;e</Q> (&s;ays he, p. 115.) <Q>a Bi&s;hop alone could not give tho&s;e holy orders, as is mo&s;t evident</Q> (&s;ays he) <Q>from <HI>Cyprian,</HI> who a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>all clerical ordinations were performed by the common coun&s;el of the whole Pre&s;bytery;</HI> and, therefore,</Q> (&s;ays he,) <Q>when, upon a <HI>mo&s;t urgent and nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion,</HI> he had been forced to ordain one but a <HI>Lector,</HI> without the advice and con&s;ent of his <HI>Pre&s;bytery,</HI> which, one would be apt to think, was no great u&s;urpation, he takes great pains to ju&s;tify and excu&s;e him&s;elf for &s;o doing.</Q> But all this &s;uppo&s;ition falls, at once, to the ground, as &s;oon as the authority, which he has cited for it, (Cy|prian's 24th Epi&s;t.) is more carefully examined; for it really contains no &s;uch doctrine, and doth <HI>not at all</HI> re|late to <HI>"clerical ordinations,"</HI> which he has too ha&s;tily &s;uppo&s;ed; Cyprian had <HI>not</HI> given <HI>"holy orders"</HI> (the &s;ubject of the learned writer's argument) to the per&s;ons for who&s;e appointment he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to apolo|gize in that epi&s;tle; for they were &s;till <HI>"&s;ub clero,"</HI> as he expre&s;sly declares, <HI>under the degree of clergy;</HI> &s;o that the apology could not be for having <HI>ordained</HI> any one in the <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> &s;en&s;e of that word; but only for <Q><HI>having</HI> MADE (or appointed) one man a <HI>Lector,</HI> or <HI>Reader,</HI> in the church, and for <HI>having</HI> MADE another man a <HI>Subdeacon.</HI></Q> <Q>FECISSE <HI>me autem &s;ciatis</HI> LECTOREM <HI>Saturum,</HI> et HYPODIACONUM <HI>Optatum confe&s;&s;orem.</HI></Q> The&s;e were mere local functions in the church, at the di&s;po&s;al, not only of the <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> and Deacons, but al&s;o of the <HI>laity,</HI> or whole congregation, who have a <HI>right</HI> to elect to &s;uch offices, in many places, even to this day; &s;o that an apology was really nece&s;&s;ary in this ca&s;e, for having acted <HI>without their con&s;ent;</HI> but no apo|logy would have been due, had the ca&s;e been a <HI>mere or|dination,</HI> or <HI>conferring of holy orders.</HI> The example is entirely foreign to the que&s;tion of <HI>pre&s;byters</HI> having a right to <HI>confer holy orders;</HI> and, as a proof that it is &s;o, be plea&s;ed to remark, that the apology is addre&s;&s;ed <HI>jointly to the Pre&s;byters and Deacons;</HI> and cannot, there|fore, prove the right of the <HI>former</HI> to confer <HI>holy orders,</HI> without admitting, al&s;o, the <HI>latter</HI> to the &s;ame degree of authority, an idea which the learned writer never intended to promote.</P>
<P><HI>Cyprian</HI> has been as much mi&s;under&s;tood by &s;ome former advocates for the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> preten&s;ions to the <HI>right of ordaining;</HI> who <Q>to prove that <HI>ordination by Bi&s;hops, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of</HI> PRESBYTERS, <HI>was always forbidden and oppo&s;ed,</HI> tell us</Q> (&s;ays Dr. Ham|mond) <Q>of <HI>Aurelius</HI>'s being ordained by <HI>Cyprian,</HI> and his <HI>collegues,</HI> ep. 33. and then a&s;&s;ure us, from ep. 58. that, by his <HI>collegues,</HI> he means his <HI>Pre&s;byters,</HI> (where yet there is no other proof of it, but the u&s;ing of the&s;e <HI>words</HI> in the <HI>in&s;cription</HI> of the <HI>epi&s;tie,</HI> Cypri|anus <HI>cum collegis,</HI> et <HI>ego et collegae,</HI> Cyprian <HI>with his collegues,</HI> and <HI>I and my collegues.)</HI> This</Q> (&s;ays Dr. Hammond) <Q>is a great, but di&s;cernible, <HI>fallacy,</HI> put upon the <HI>reader,</HI> as will &s;oon appear, 1. if we but ob&s;erve that the 33d epi&s;tle, where he tells of Aure|lius, was written by <HI>Cyprian</HI> to his <HI>Pre&s;byters,</HI> and &s;o THEY ARE the per&s;ons whom he adverti&s;eth, what <HI>he and his collegues</HI> had done, and &s;o, &s;ure, WERE NOT tho&s;e <HI>collegues</HI> that did it <HI>with</HI> him.

<P>I &s;hould not have made &s;o long a quotation from Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> had not the learned <HI>Chancellor</HI> (or author of the tract ju&s;t before cited) once more held forth the&s;e very te&s;timonies to ju&s;tify <HI>ordination by Pre&s;byters,</HI> though they had long before been &s;o amply confuted by Dr. Hammond.</P>
<P>"It is a &s;ad mi&s;take" (&s;ays the rev.

The <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> times did not begin at the council of <HI>Arles,</HI> yet there we had our Bi&s;hops: The fathers of the council of <HI>Nice</HI> had &s;pent their days under the &s;evere&s;t per&s;ecutions of the heathen, and were ju&s;t entered upon the morn|ing of the chri&s;tian empire, and &s;hall we think that popery was then prevalent? Our church is now &s;et|tled as it was at that time: Not only Bi&s;hops all over <HI>Britain,</HI> &s;o far as it was chri&s;tian, but very near the &s;ame number of Bi&s;hops. The three chief bi&s;hop|rics were &s;ettled at three mo&s;t di&s;tant and proper places to have juri&s;diction over the re&s;t, <HI>London, York,</HI> and <HI>Caerleon:</HI> There were in all 28 cities, and accord|ingly 28 bi&s;hoprics, as the number is given us both by <HI>Gildas</HI> and <HI>Bede;</HI> and, if we have now two le&s;s, yet &s;o much of Britain as lies between <HI>Berwick</HI> and <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> now belonging to <HI>Scotland,</HI> may well be allowed for the making of two. At the council of <HI>Nice,</HI> the juri&s;diction of their metropolitans was &s;ettled, and the union of all the Bi&s;hops of the Pro|vince provided for: Such was the order and harmony of the whole clergy, that, though the dioce&s;e was &s;o large that it could not be particularly known and taught by the &s;uperior officers of the church, yet every one acting in his place, and being accountable to tho&s;e above him, there was no defect either in the doctrine or di&s;cipline of tho&s;e primitive times.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Certainly there is demon&s;tration for epi&s;copacy, in that there <HI>were not only Bi&s;hops before popery,</HI> but when the popi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;et up in the world, <HI>the old Bi&s;hops were the very men that made the oppo&s;i|tion again&s;t them.</HI> Nothing can be more undoubted in hi&s;tory, than that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops met <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> and his companions at the famous oak upon the banks of <HI>Severn,</HI> and there utterly broke with them, pe|remptorily refu&s;ing &s;ubjection to the pope of Rome, It is al&s;o as certain that <HI>Colman,</HI> bi&s;hop of <HI>Lindis|farn,</HI> and his northern clergy, who had their origi|nal Chri&s;tianity from <HI>Britain,</HI> maintained the grand di&s;pute at <HI>Strean&s;hale</HI> again&s;t <HI>Agelbert, Wilfrid,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Romani&s;ts; that they retired and for|&s;ook their preferments rather than they would &s;ubmit to the impo&s;itions of <HI>Rome.</HI> The laying a&s;ide their ancient ob&s;ervations, and receiving the papal ton&s;ure, were looked upon by them both as innovations and badges of &s;ervitude to a foreign power, and therefore rejected by them, as they are by us at this day. We mu&s;t maintain, like them, the cu&s;toms of the church, which have been from the beginning; there <HI>always was a commemoration of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles at certain times,</HI> which we al&s;o ob&s;erve without any he or &s;he &s;aints of the <HI>Roman</HI> make: There always was a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the authority of the church in matters of decency and order, which is all that we require, without the lea&s;t &s;ubjection to the church of <HI>Rome:</HI> We yield no deference, we utterly renounce her au|thority over us. And, to &s;uppo&s;e that our reformers either wanted judgement to di&s;tingui&s;h between the ancient cu&s;toms of the church and the later inventions of popery, or that they wanted integrity to the true chri&s;tian religion, who&s;e works and martyrdom bear witne&s;s in their favour, is &s;uch a pretence as cannot &s;upport it&s;elf under a &s;incere con&s;ideration.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>We &s;hould be fond of epi&s;copacy, if we did but review that oppo&s;ition which the pope always made again&s;t it;</HI> if we did but ob&s;erve <HI>how he could never compa&s;s his ends but by the de&s;truction of its power.</HI> He rai&s;ed up the &s;e|veral orders of monks, that tho&s;e who were employed in religion might depend <HI>upon him, and not upon their Bi&s;hops;</HI> he exempted the mona&s;teries from the juri&s;|diction of the dioce&s;ans, that all tho&s;e rich planta|tions might heartily e&s;pou&s;e the tyranny and &s;uper&s;ti|tion of <HI>Rome.</HI> He did all he could to transform the bi&s;hops into monks, and prevailed &s;o far, that every archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> thought it nece&s;&s;ary to put on that habit; which made his <HI>epi&s;copacy &s;ub&s;ervient to another &s;ort of government.</HI> He found that a dioce&s;an Bi&s;hop, with his clergy in a cathedral church, was &s;uch a bulwark to the national e&s;tabli&s;hment, that he could not dilate his empire; he therefore, by his intere&s;t with King <HI>Egbert,</HI> got the great <HI>O&s;wald</HI> law to pa&s;s, <HI>by which the Pre&s;byters were ca&s;t out, and monks put in|to their places.</HI> How can epi&s;copacy be a popi&s;h in|vention, when it has been all along <HI>the great bu&s;ine&s;s of the pope to overthrow it?</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>We mu&s;t ever own great honour and reverence due to <HI>Columba,</HI> who planted his mona&s;tery or univer&s;ity in the i&s;le of <HI>Hye,</HI> upon the coa&s;ts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was a &s;eminary for all the chri&s;tian mini&s;ters of the north; but that the cu&s;tom or education of this place &s;hould be again&s;t epi&s;copacy is impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ince they <HI>not only had a Bi&s;hop in that little i&s;land,</HI> but <HI>Adam|nanus,</HI> one of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of <HI>Columba,</HI> gives us an account of the great deference they always paid to that order. Bi&s;hop <HI>Aidan</HI> came from thence, con|verted the <HI>Northumbrians,</HI> had his epi&s;copal &s;ee in the i&s;land of <HI>Lindisfarn,</HI> which was afterwards re|moved to <HI>Durham.</HI> After he was dead, Bi&s;hop <HI>Finan</HI> was ordained by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and &s;ucceeded him; by <HI>Finan</HI> was <HI>Diuma,</HI> the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> or|dained, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ors were al&s;o from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of the epi&s;copal order. We meet al&s;o <HI>Colman</HI> from <HI>Scotland,</HI> that Bi&s;hop of the <HI>Northumbrians,</HI> who was ejected for the prote&s;tant cau&s;e. If <HI>Columba</HI> him&s;elf had &s;uch an affection of the mona&s;tic life, that he would not &s;tir from <HI>Hye,</HI> and was of &s;o great au|thority that it was thought fit the Bi&s;hops of the north &s;hould be accountable to him and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to whom &s;o much was committed of the royal power, this can be no argument again&s;t epi&s;copacy it&s;elf; &s;ince it is declared, at the &s;ame time, that &s;uch a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops to an abbot was a perverting that order which was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the church. Tho&s;e who read only the account of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the la&s;t century, may, perhaps, have an opinion that there was an ancient of Pre&s;byterian government there; but all authentic hi&s;tories te&s;tify that they had the &s;ame con&s;titution of eccle&s;ia&s;tical orders, which were in the re&s;t of <HI>Britain,</HI> and all other chri&s;tian nations.</Q></P></NOTE>, and al&s;o more particularly the Independents,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ANSWER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE ancient mode of dividing great cities was by <HI>wards;</HI> each of which was governed by an <HI>alderman,</HI> the <HI>ealdor|man</HI> of the Anglo-Saxons, an officer of great authority in the <HI>common law;</HI> being a JUSTICIARY, and having all the powers of our modern <HI>ju&s;tices of the peace;</HI> and, what is more, was always elected by the
<PB N="368" REF="362"><HI>hou&s;e-keepers</HI> or <HI>deciners</HI> of the <HI>ward over</HI> which he pre&s;ides. This antient mode of divi&s;ion by no means interferes with the le&s;&s;er divi&s;ions of <HI>tithings</HI> and <HI>hundreds;</HI> &s;o far from it, that the government of the <HI>wards</HI> is not complete without them. The Lord Mayor's precept, to the alder|men, orders them (to this day) to hold courts of <HI>frankpledge</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bohun's Privilegia Londini, p. 386. under the head of <HI>Wardmote Courts</HI> and the Lord Mayor's annual Precept to hold them; which latter, among&s;t other things, contains the following article.&mdash;No. 11. <Q>And, for that, of late, there is more re&s;ort to the city of per|&s;ons evil affected in religion, and otherwi&s;e, than in former times hath been; you &s;hall diligently inquire if any man be received to dwell or abide within your Ward, that is not <HI>put under</HI> FRANKPLEDGE, <HI>as he ought to be by the cu&s;tom of the city:</HI></Q> &amp;c.</NOTE>; which were not without the regular divi&s;ions of <HI>tithings</HI> to give them effect. The wards are <HI>local</HI> divi&s;ions of various magnitude, and have been formed, (as you &s;ugge&s;t,) &s;ome by <HI>&s;treets,</HI> &s;ome by the inter&s;ection of <HI>brooks,</HI> now covered over; but tho&s;e various di|men&s;ions
<PB N="369" REF="363">of &s;pace required a regular <HI>nu|merical</HI> divi&s;ion of the <HI>hou&s;ekeepers,</HI> in or|der to a&s;certain the due proportion of the repre&s;entatives in the <HI>common-council</HI> of the city.</P>
<P>The average-rate of <HI>common-council|men</HI> to the <HI>hou&s;ekeepers,</HI> or <HI>deciners,</HI> is, at pre&s;ent, about one to 90. And as the city was, in antient times, more popu|lous, and the hou&s;es &s;maller for each fa|mily, when men were re&s;trained by law from building in the environs of the city, it is probable that the true proportion of <HI>hou&s;ekeepers,</HI> to elect <HI>one common-council|man,</HI> &s;hould be 100; &s;o that the com|mon council has formerly been an a&s;&s;em|bly of <HI>hundreders</HI> or <HI>high con&s;tables.</HI> As the gates of the city have been removed &s;o as to leave this mo&s;t important place entirely expo&s;ed to the fatal con&s;equences of any &s;udden riot, the attacks of any
