<HEAD>The BEE, the ANT, and the SPARROW: A FABLE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Addre&s;s'd to PHEBE and KITTY C. at Boarding School.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MY dears, 'tis &s;aid in days of old,</L>
<L>That bea&s;ts cou'd talk, and birds cou'd &s;cold.</L>
<L>But now it &s;eems the human race</L>
<L>Alone engro&s;s the &s;peaker's place.</L>
<L>Yet lately, if report be true,</L>
<L>(And much the tale relates to you)</L>
<L>There met a Sparrow, Ant, and Bee,</L>
<L>Which rea&s;on'd and convers'd as we.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who reads my page will doubtle&s;s grant</L>
<L>That Phe's the wi&s;e indu&s;trious Ant.</L>
<L>And all with half an eye may &s;ee</L>
<L>That Kitty is the bu&s;y Bee.</L>
<L>Here then are two&mdash;but where's the third?</L>
<L>Go &s;earch your &s;chool, you'll &s;ind the Bird.</L>
<L>Your &s;chool! I a&s;k your pardon fair,</L>
<L>I'm &s;ure you'll find no Sparrow there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now to my tale&mdash;One &s;ummer's morn</L>
<L>A Bee rang'd o'er the verdant lawn;</L>
<L><PB N="170" REF="172">
Studious to hu&s;band every hour,</L>
<L>And make the mo&s;t of ev'ry flow'r.</L>
<L>Nimble from &s;talk to &s;talk &s;he flies,</L>
<L>And loads with yellow wax her thighs;</L>
<L>With which the arti&s;t builds her comb,</L>
<L>And keeps all tight and warm at home:</L>
<L>Or from the cow&s;lip's golden bells</L>
<L>Sucks honey to enrich her cells:</L>
<L>Or every tempting ro&s;e pur&s;ues,</L>
<L>Or &s;ips the lilly's fragrant dews;</L>
<L>Yet never robs the &s;hining bloom,</L>
<L>Or of its beauty or perfume.</L>
<L>Thus &s;he di&s;charg'd in every way</L>
<L>The various duties of the day.</L>

<L>Who&s;e brow was wrinkled o'er by care:</L>
<L>A great oeconomi&s;t was &s;he,</L>
<L>Nor le&s;s laborious than the Bee;</L>
<L>By pen&s;ive parents often taught</L>
<L>What ills ari&s;e from want of thought;</L>
<L>That poverty on &s;loth depends,</L>
<L>On poverty the lo&s;s of friends.</L>
<L>Hence every day the Ant is found</L>
<L>With anxious &s;teps to tread the ground;</L>
<L>With curious &s;earch to trace the grain,</L>
<L>And drag the heavy load with pain.</L>

Ah! &s;i&s;ter-labourer, &s;ays &s;he,</L>

<L>And toil and probity their &s;cheme:</L>

<L>When to di&s;play her naughty mind,</L>
<L>Hunger with cruelty combin'd;</L>
<L>She view'd the Ant with &s;avage eyes,</L>

<L>Virtue in fairy tales is &s;een</L>

<L>Fair Virtue &s;hone; his open look</L>

<L>The truth he labour'd to expre&s;s,</L>
