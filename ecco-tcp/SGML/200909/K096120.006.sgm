<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>continued.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE gardens of the Chine&s;e are generally very &s;mall. Nature is their plan, and their whole &s;tudy is, to imitate her in all her delightful irregularities. The fir&s;t con&s;ideration is, the form of the ground, whether it be flat, &s;loping, hilly, or mountainous; exten&s;ive, or of &s;mall compa&s;s; of a dry or mar&s;hy nature, abound|ing with rivers and &s;prings, or liable to &s;carcity of water;
<PB N="4" REF="4">
to all which circum&s;tances they carefully attend, chu&s;ing &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions as humour the ground, can be executed with the lea&s;t expence, hide it's defects, and &s;et it's ad|vantages in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous light. Such a plan of gardening, the Engli&s;h now pur&s;ue, and are the only na|tion that has yet thought proper to imitate them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To form a garden on the plan of the Chine&s;e, I will refer my readers to a pamphlet, lately publi&s;hed, called <HI>Elements of modern gardening, with the art of embel|li&s;hing the views round about our hou&s;es,</HI> wherein every nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truction is given.</NOTE></P>
<P>Not being great lovers of walking, we &s;eldom meet with avenues, or &s;pacious walks, as in European planta|tions. The whole ground is laid out in a variety of &s;cenes, and you are led by winding pa&s;&s;ages, cut in the groves, to different points of view; each terminated by a &s;eat, a building, or &s;ome other object.</P>
<P>The perfection of the&s;e gardens, con&s;i&s;ts in the num|ber, beauty and diver&s;ity of the &s;cenes. Chine&s;e gar|deners, like European painters, collect, from nature, the mo&s;t plea&s;ing objects, which they endeavour to com|bine, in &s;uch a way, as, not only to appear to the be&s;t advantage &s;eparately, but to unite in forming an ele|gant and &s;triking whole.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">Their arti&s;ts di&s;tingui&s;h three different &s;pecies of &s;cenes, to which they give the appellations of Plea&s;ing, Horrid, and Enchanted. Their enchanted &s;cenes corre&s;pond, in a great mea&s;ure, with what we call Romantic; and in the&s;e they make u&s;e of &s;everal artifices to excite &s;urpri&s;e. Sometimes a rapid &s;tream, or torrent, &s;hall ru&s;h under ground, and its turbulent noi&s;e, &s;hall &s;trike the ear of a pa&s;&s;er-by, without knowing from whence it proceeds. At other times, they will di&s;po&s;e the rocks, buildings, and other objects that form the compo&s;ition, in &s;uch a manner, that the wind &s;hall whi&s;tle through the different pa&s;&s;ages and cavities made in them for the purpo&s;e, and cau&s;e other uncommon &s;ounds. They introduce into the&s;e &s;cenes, all kinds of extraordinary trees, plants, and flowers; form artificial and complicated echoes; and let loo&s;e different &s;orts of mon&s;trous birds and animals.</P>
<P>In their &s;cenes of Horror, they introduce impending rocks, dark caverns, bottomle&s;s aby&s;&s;es, and impetuous cataracts; ru&s;hing, and tumbling down the mountains, on all &s;ides. The trees are ill-formed, &s;eemingly torn to pieces by violent tempe&s;ts; &s;ome are thrown up by the roots, and intercept the cour&s;e of the torrent, appearing as if brought down by the fury of the waters; others look as if &s;hattered and bla&s;ted by the force of lightning; the buildings, &s;ome in ruins, and here and there a mi&s;e|rable hut di&s;per&s;ed in the mountains, &s;erve at once to in|dicate the exi&s;tence, and wretchedne&s;s of the inhabitants. The&s;e dreadful &s;cenes, are generally &s;ucceeded by plea&s;|ing
<PB N="6" REF="6">
ones. Knowing how powerfully contra&s;t operates upon the mind, the Chine&s;e arti&s;ts con&s;tantly practi&s;e &s;udden tran&s;itions, and a &s;triking oppo&s;ition of forms, colours, and &s;hades; thus they conduct you from limited pro&s;|pects, to exten&s;ive views; from objects of horror, to &s;cenes of delight; from lakes and rivers, to plains, hills, and woods; to dark and gloomy colours, they oppo&s;e &s;uch as are brilliant, and to complicated forms, &s;imple ones; di&s;tributing, by a judicious arangement, the diffe|rent ma&s;&s;es of light and &s;hade, in &s;uch a way, as to ren|der the compo&s;ition at once di&s;tinct in its parts, and yet &s;triking in the whole.</P>
<P>When the ground is exten&s;ive, and a multiplicity of &s;cenes are to be introduced, they generally adapt each to one &s;ingle point of view; but where it is limited, and affords no room for variety, they endeavour to remedy this defect, by di&s;po&s;ing the objects &s;o, that, being viewed from different points, they produce different repre&s;enta|tions; and, &s;ometimes, by an artful di&s;po&s;ition, &s;uch as have no re&s;emblance to each other.</P>
<P>In their large gardens, they contrive different &s;cenes, for morning, noon, and evening; erecting, at proper points of view, buildings adapted to the recreations of each particular time of the day: and, in the &s;mall ones (where, as hath been ob&s;erved, one arrangement pro|duces many repre&s;entations) they di&s;per&s;e, in the &s;ame manner, at the &s;everal points of view, buildings, which,

<PB N="7" REF="8">
for their u&s;e, point out the time of day, for enjoying the &s;cene in its perfection.</P>
<P>As the climate of China is very hot, they throw a great deal of water into their gardens. In &s;mall ones, if the &s;ituation admits, they frequently lay the whole ground under water, leaving only &s;ome i&s;lands and rocks; in larger ones, they introduce exten&s;ive lakes, rivers, and canals. The banks of their lakes and rivers are varie|gated in imitation of nature; being &s;ometimes bare and gravelly, &s;ometimes fringed with woods, to the water's edge: in &s;ome places flat, &s;cattered with flowers and &s;hrubs; in others rocky, and forming caverns, into which parts of the waters di&s;charge them&s;elves, with noi&s;e and violence. Sometimes you &s;ee meadows covered with cattle, or rice-grounds that run out into the lakes, leav|ing between them, pa&s;&s;ages for ve&s;&s;els, and &s;ometimes groves; into which enter, in different parts, creeks and rivulets, &s;ufficiently deep to admit boats; their banks be|ing planted with trees, who&s;e &s;preading branches form arbours for boats, droop their heads into the water, or feather to the ground. The&s;e generally conduct to &s;ome very intere&s;ting object, &s;uch as a magnificent building; places on the top of a mountain, cut into terraces; a ca&s;ino, &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of a lake; a &s;ummer-room, built under the water, with &s;teps leading from the &s;hore, and &s;urrounded with gla&s;s, to &s;ee the fi&s;h, as they &s;wim over and about them; a ca&s;cade; a grotto, cut into a
<PB N="8" REF="9">
variety of apartments; an artificial rock, and many other inventions.</P>
<P>Their rivers are &s;eldom &s;trait, but &s;erpentine, broken into many irregular points. Sometimes they are narrow, noi&s;y, and rapid; at others, deep, &s;preading, and &s;low. Both in their rivers and lakes, are &s;een reeds and other aquatic plants and flowers; and over the&s;e they frequently erect mills, and other hydraulic machines, to enliven the &s;cenes by their motion. They have al&s;o a great num|ber of ve&s;&s;els on the&s;e waters, of different forms and &s;izes. In their lakes they inter&s;per&s;e i&s;lands, &s;ome of which &s;hall be barren, and &s;urrounded with rocks and &s;hoals, and others enriched with every thing that art and nature can furni&s;h, mo&s;t perfect. They likewi&s;e form artificial rocks; and, in compo&s;itions of this kind, &s;urpa&s;s all other nations. The mak|ing them is a di&s;tinct profe&s;&s;ion; and there are, at Canton, and probably, in mo&s;t other cities of China, numbers of artificers, con&s;tantly employed in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s. The &s;tone they are made of, is brought from the &s;outhern coa&s;ts of China, is of a blui&s;h ca&s;t, and worn into irregular forms, by the action of the waves. The Chine&s;e are exceedingly nice in the choice of this &s;tone, in&s;omuch, that a large price has been given for a bit, no bigger than a man's fi&s;t, when it has happened to be of a beautiful form, and lively colour. But the&s;e &s;elect pieces they u&s;e in land&s;capes, for their apartments: in gardens they employ a coar&s;er &s;ort, which they join with a blui&s;h cement, and form rocks of a con&s;iderable &s;ize. When
<PB N="9" REF="10">
they are large, they make them into caves and grottos, with openings, through which you di&s;cover pro&s;pects at a di&s;tance. They cloath them, in different places, with trees, &s;hrubs, briers, and mo&s;s, placing on their tops, little temples, or other buildings, to which you a&s;cend, by rugged and irregular &s;teps, cut in &s;uch rock.</P>
<P>When they have a &s;ufficient &s;upply of water, and pro|per ground, their gardens are never without ca&s;cades. In the&s;e works, they avoid all regularity, following nature, according to her operations, in a mountainous country. In &s;ome places, water &s;hall bur&s;t from among the ca|verns and windings of the rocks; in others, a large and impetuous cataract &s;hall appear, and in others again, are &s;een many gentler and le&s;&s;er falls. Sometimes the view of a ca&s;cade &s;hall be intercepted by trees, who&s;e leaves and branches, &s;hall &s;carce leave room to di&s;cover the wa|ters, as they pa&s;s down the mountain's-&s;ide: and high wooden bridges, are frequently thrown from one rock to another, over the &s;teepe&s;t part of the cataract, and its pa&s;&s;age often interrupted, by trees and heaps of &s;tones, that &s;eem to be brought down by the violence of the torrent.</P>
<P>In their plantations, they vary the form and colours of their trees, mixing &s;uch as have large and &s;preading branches, with tho&s;e of pyramidal figures, and dark greens with lighter, inter&s;per&s;ing, among them, &s;uch as produce flowers, of which they have &s;ome that bloom great part of the year. The weeping willow is one of
<PB N="10" REF="11">
their favourite trees, and always among tho&s;e that border their lakes and rivers, being &s;o planted as to have its branches hanging over the water. They likewi&s;e intro|duce trunks of decayed trees, &s;ometimes erect, &s;ome|times lying on the ground, and are very nice about their form, and colour of their bark and mo&s;s.</P>
<P>Various are the artifices they u&s;e to &s;urpri&s;e; &s;ome|times they lead you through caverns, and gloomy pa&s;|&s;ages; at quitting which, you are, on a &s;udden, &s;truck with a view of a delicious land&s;cape, enriched with every thing luxuriant nature affords mo&s;t beautiful. At other times, you are conducted through avenues and walks, that gradually dimini&s;h and grow rugged, until the pa&s;|&s;age is quite intercepted, and rendered impa&s;&s;able, by bu&s;hes, briars, and &s;tones; when unexpectedly, again, a rich and exten&s;ive pro&s;pect opens to the view, &s;o much the more plea&s;ing, as it was the le&s;s looked for.</P>
<P>Another of their artifices, is to hide &s;ome part of a compo&s;ition, by trees, or other intermediate objects. This naturally excites the curio&s;ity of the &s;pectator, to take a nearer view, when he is &s;urpri&s;ed by &s;ome un|looked-for &s;cene, or &s;ome repre&s;entation totally oppo&s;ite to the thing he expected. The termination of their lakes they always hide, leaving room for the imagination to work; and the &s;ame rule they ob&s;erve in other compo&s;i|tions, where it can be put in practice.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">Though the Chine&s;e are not well ver&s;ed in optics, yet, experience has taught them, that objects appear le&s;s, and grow dim, in proportion as they are further removed from the eye. The&s;e di&s;coveries have given ri&s;e to an artifice in circum&s;cribed grounds, which they &s;ometimes carry into execution. This is, forming per&s;pective, as a painter does upon a canvas, by dimini&s;hing the objects in &s;ize and colour, in proportion to their &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;tance. Thus they introduce buildings, ve&s;&s;els, and other objects, &s;maller and &s;maller, according as they are more di&s;tant in point of &s;ight; and, by this, give an idea of much greater extent. And, that the deceptions may be &s;till more &s;trik|ing, they give a greyi&s;h tinge to the di&s;tant parts of the compo&s;ition; and plant, in the remoter parts of the&s;e &s;cenes, trees of a fainter green, and &s;maller growth, than tho&s;e which appear in front, or in the fore-ground.</P>
<P>Though they generally avoid &s;trait lines, they do not always reject them. They &s;ometimes form avenues, when they have any intere&s;ting object to expo&s;e to view. Roads they always make &s;trait, unle&s;s the unevenne&s;s of the land, or other impediments prevent it; for expe|dition in travelling, is what every one wi&s;hes, and it is not natural, &s;ay they, to &s;uppo&s;e men would travel a crooked, or round-about way, if they could go by a &s;trait one.</P>
<P>What an Engli&s;h gardener calls clumps, the Chine&s;e are not unacquainted with, but do not make &s;uch fre|quent
<PB N="12" REF="13">
u&s;e of them, as we do. They never fill a whole piece of ground with clumps. They con&s;ider a piece of ground as painters do a picture, and group their trees in the &s;ame manner as they do their figures, having their principal and &s;ub&s;ervient ma&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Chine&s;e manner of laying out grounds, is very difficult, and not to be attained by per&s;ons of nar|row intellects; for, though the principles are &s;imple and obvious, it yet requires genius, judgment, and experi|ence; a &s;trong imagination, and a perfect knowledge of the human mind, to put them in execution. Their whole country, indeed, is a garden, dre&s;&s;ed, and laid out in the manner I have here de&s;cribed; nay, as I have ob|&s;erved before, they cut their large&s;t mountains into forms.</P>

<P>And as it is proved, by facts, that the population of Chi|na, for a long time pa&s;t, has been progre&s;&s;ively increa&s;|ing, and 28 years has elap&s;ed &s;ince the la&s;t numeration, may we not &s;uppo&s;e that this empire contains, at pre&s;ent, not le&s;s than 200,000,000? Of cour&s;e, it mu&s;t be allow|ed, that no &s;overeign in the univer&s;e, commands &s;o many people, united in the &s;ame &s;ociety, and governed by the &s;ame laws. And what can &s;uch an inexhau&s;table increa&s;e of people, in that remote corner of A&s;ia, be owing to? No preci&s;e an&s;wer can be given to this que&s;tion; but the following, are the mo&s;t apparent cau&s;es. The va&s;t extent of cultivation, is one great phy&s;ical cau&s;e; and this is &s;econded, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the influence of the fol|lowing, moral and political in&s;titutions. 1. The &s;trict ob|&s;ervance of filial duty, and the privileges of a father, which makes a &s;on his be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t property. 2. The infamy attached to the memory of tho&s;e who die with|out po&s;terity. 3. That univer&s;al cu&s;tom that makes the marriage of children the principal concern of parents.
<PB N="14" REF="15">
4. The honours be&s;towed, by government, on tho&s;e wi|dows that do not enter a &s;econd time into the &s;tate of matrimony. 5. Frequent adoptions, which prevent the extinction of families. 6. The return of wealth to its original &s;tock, by di&s;inheriting of daughters. 7. The re|tirement of wives, which renders them more attentive to their hu&s;bands, &s;aves them from a number of accidents when with child, and con&s;trains them to employ them|&s;elves in the care of their children. 8. The marriage of the &s;oldiers. 9. The fixed rate of taxes, which being always laid on lands, never fall but indirectly on the trader and mechanic. 10. The &s;mall number of &s;ailors and travellers. To the&s;e may be added, the great num|ber of people who re&s;ide in China, only by intervals; the profound peace the empire enjoys; the frugal and labo|rious manner in which the opulent live; the little atten|tion that is paid to the vain and ridiculous prejudice of not marrying below one's rank; the ancient policy of di&s;tinction to men, not to families, by attaching nobility only to employments and talents, without &s;uffering it to become hereditary; and, la&s;tly, decency of public man|ners, and a total ignorance of &s;candalous intrigues, and ruinous gallantry.</P>
<P>In &s;o large a country, it cannot be expected, but that the complexions and features, if not the &s;tature of the di&s;tant inhabitants, mu&s;t vary. If it is not difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h a north from a &s;outh Briton, or an Engli&s;h|man from a Frenchman; how much more di&s;tingui&s;ha|ble
<PB N="15" REF="16">
mu&s;t the people of the North of China be, from tho&s;e of the South, who are 30 degrees of latitude di&s;tant from each other? Therefore, when &s;ome authors &s;ay they are fair, and others tawny, they may both &s;peak truth, but &s;peak of different provinces. However, it &s;eems to be admitted by mo&s;t writers, that the major part of the Chine&s;e (for the Tartars we have already de&s;cribed) are &s;quat, well-&s;et men, with broad faces, black hair, &s;mall, dark eyes, &s;hort no&s;es and thin beards, which they wear long, on the bottom of the chin and upper lips, but pull it from their cheeks with tweezers. The gentry and the <HI>literati,</HI> &s;uffer the nails of their left-hand to grow two or three inches longer than their fingers, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from mechanics.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e admire one that is tall and fat, a little above the common &s;ize; and if he has a broad forehead, little eyes, a &s;hort no&s;e, great ears, a little mouth, and a long beard, he is con&s;idered as a complete beauty. Their ears are univer&s;ally long, broad, dangling, thick, open, and &s;oft, with little or no border, and of a &s;ub&s;tance ra|ther fle&s;hy than cartilaginous. A loud voice, e&s;pecially in a magi&s;trate; is al&s;o, with them, a fine accompli&s;h|ment. The women, who are kept up, and not expo&s;ed to the &s;un, are fair enough, and, excepting their little eyes, and &s;hort no&s;es, may view hour Europ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n beau|ties, and their exce&s;&s;ive mode&s;ty adds much to their charms; their fore-heads are large, their eye-brows &s;mall and well arched, their eyes black, but almo&s;t hid with
<PB N="16" REF="17">
the lid; their mouths little, with plump, vermilion lips; their cheeks and chin of a fine &s;ymmetry, the neck &s;mall, arms long and &s;lender, and pretty, &s;mall hands; the nails of their fingers are never pared, but kept very clean, &s;o that they are more than two inches long, to &s;hew that they are not employed in &s;ervile work. But what is mo&s;t remarkable, is their little feet, in which their principal beauty is thought to lie. And to give and pre&s;erve their beauty, great pains is taken to keep them as &s;mall as when they fir&s;t came into the world. Scarcely is a girl born, but the nur&s;e binds up her feet &s;o right, that they cannot grow; and this torture mu&s;t be endured, until the feet has naturally done growing. Owing to this, a Chi|ne&s;e woman rather drags her&s;elf along, than walks,; but a &s;mall foot is, to her, &s;o great an ornament, that &s;he thinks &s;he cannot pay too dear for it; and her feet, of cour&s;e, are no larger than tho&s;e of a child of three years old. Some attribute this cu&s;tom to jealou&s;y, whil&s;t others con&s;ider it as a political expedient to keep them at home, and in a &s;tate of dependence. Indeed, a Chine&s;e woman is condemned to an almo&s;t, perpetual impri&s;on|ment in her apartment, and to be vi&s;ible to none but her hu&s;band, and a few dome&s;tics; and yet &s;he will employ as much time every day, as an Engli&s;h beauty who wi&s;hes to &s;hine at a ball or an opera.</P>
<P>In cities, the dre&s;s of the Chine&s;e, is agreeable to the gravity they affect, and almo&s;t the &s;ame among people of both cla&s;&s;es (for there are but two, gentry and people in

trade), and both &s;exes: but certain, acce&s;&s;ary ornaments di&s;tingui&s;h the rank of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e that wear them, and tho&s;e <HI>in&s;ignia</HI> being regulated by government, &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;e|ment would be the con&s;equence, to any one who &s;hould pre&s;ume to put on a dre&s;s not authori&s;ed.</P>
<P>The general dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of a long ve&s;t, which folds over the brea&s;t, and reaches to the ground. It is fa&s;tened on the right &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de, by four or five, gold or &s;ilver buttons; the &s;leeves are wide at the &s;houlders, growing narrower to the wri&s;t, where they terminate in form of a hor&s;e|&s;hoe, covering the whole hand, and leaving the ends of the fingers only to be &s;een. The ve&s;t is tied round the wai&s;t, with a &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k &s;a&s;h, the ends of which reach to the knees. From this girdle, hangs a knife in a &s;heath, with a pair of chop&s;ticks, which they u&s;e as forks. In &s;um|mer, their necks are bare, but in winter, and cold wea|ther, they cover them with a &s;atin cape, &s;ewed to their ve&s;t, and edged with fur; and the ve&s;t it&s;elf is al&s;o trim|med with &s;heep&s;kin, or quilted with &s;ilk and cotton. People of rank line theirs with &s;able, or the fine&s;t fox-&s;kins trimmed with &s;able, and, in &s;pring, with ermine. Over this ve&s;t, they wear al&s;o a kind of &s;urtout, that reaches to the wai&s;t, with wide, &s;hort &s;leeves, ending at the elbow. This is al&s;o, in cold weather, lined with fur.</P>
<P>Under this ve&s;t, both men and women wear wide, &s;hort &s;hirts, of different kinds of cloth, according to the &s;ea&s;on, rather made like a wai&s;tcoat that folds over the
<PB N="18" REF="19">
bo&s;om, and with clo&s;e, narrow &s;leeves, fa&s;tened at the wri&s;t: they wear al&s;o, a pair of drawers of the &s;ame; over the&s;e, a pair of trow&s;ers, made of linen, &s;ilk, or &s;atin, and lined occa&s;ionally with furs, as they can afford. Under the &s;hirt, &s;ome wear a &s;ilk net, to prevent it &s;ticking to the &s;kin. People of condition, never go out but in boots, generally made of quilted &s;atin, &s;ilk, or cotton, but always dyed of &s;ome colour. The&s;e boots have neither heel nor top, they are made to fit the foot with great exactne&s;s,, and &s;lippers worn over them. When they ride, the&s;e boots are made of leather, but &s;oft and pliable. Under their boots, they wear boot-&s;tockings, of quilted &s;tuff, lined with cotton, reaching above the top of the boot, and ornamented with a vel|ver or &s;ilk border. In &s;ummer, the&s;e &s;tockings are made of cooler materials. The foot of the boot is like the leg; of cour&s;e, &s;lippers mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;ary, which have good &s;ub&s;tantial &s;oles.</P>
<P>They had retained the &s;ame fa&s;hion in their cloaths and habits, above 2000 years, when the Tartars obliged them to cut off their hair, and make &s;ome little altera|tion in their dre&s;s, which alteration &s;till continues. They cannot reconcile them&s;elves to wear wigs, or draw on &s;traight or tight &s;tockings or breeches, di&s;covering &s;o much leg and thigh as do the Europeans. Dre&s;&s;ed, how|ever, according to the&s;e former fa&s;hions, and the rule of &s;tate, a Chine&s;e never forgets his fan; he would as &s;oon forget his boots; and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary do they con&s;ider the

boot, that, when any one pays them a vi&s;it, and their boots are not on, they will make their friend wait till they put them on.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of a villager differs from that worn by tho&s;e who live in towns, in the &s;ame proportion as in other countries. It con&s;i&s;ts of a coar&s;e, linen frock, over which is thrown a cotton ve&s;t, that reaches to the middle of the thigh. He has a pair of large drawers, that reach to his ancle. His wooden &s;hoes terminate, at the toe, in a &s;harp point, and are turned backwards.</P>
<P><HI>Le Comte</HI> &s;ays, Per&s;ons of condition will often, at home, and among their friends, u&s;e a freedom not com|mendable, that is &s;tripping them&s;elves quite naked, ex|cept a pair of thin, tran&s;parent drawers; and that this is the more &s;urpri&s;ing, as they condemn all nakedne&s;s in pictures. Nay, he &s;ays, the vulgar, in the &s;outhern pro|vinces, will tran&s;gre&s;s all bounds of mode&s;ty in this re|&s;pect, and watermen and workmen will go abroad, in the public &s;treets, without either cap, &s;tockings, or &s;hirt; by which they are much tanned and &s;warthy.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e paintings which we have of the Chine&s;e, they appear to be bald; they are not &s;o naturally. That &s;mall portion of hair, which they pre&s;erve on the tops of their heads, or behind, is all that is allowed by cu&s;tom: it is generally very long, and plaited into a tail. In &s;ummer, they cover their heads with a cap, formed like an inverted
<PB N="20" REF="22">
funnel, or a bell, which does not reach to their ears. The&s;e are made with rattan, or cane, very prettily wrought, and lined with &s;atin, with a tuft of deep red hair, on the point, at top, which &s;preads over it, and covers it to the brim. This hair is that which grows between the legs of a certain &s;pecies of cow, very fine, and takes any colour readily. Any one may wear this. Some will have, on the top of this cap, a button of amber, or gla&s;s, which glitters, and the hair-fringe, flowing in the wind, has a pretty effect. In winter, the&s;e caps are made of plu&s;h, turned up with fur; and being very &s;hallow, are tied under the chin, with a &s;tring. The winter-caps of the gentry, will, from the value of the fur, co&s;t, &s;ome|times ten or twelve pounds &s;terling. When they ride, in bad weather, their &s;urtouts, caps, and ve&s;ts, are made of green, oiled &s;kin.</P>
<P>There is another cap, which mandarins, and the <HI>lite|rati</HI> have only a right to wear, made in the form above, but lined with red &s;atin, and covered with white; with red, &s;ilk fringe flowing from the top, in&s;tead of hair.</P>
<P>When they vi&s;it any per&s;on of quality, or go abroad, they wear a long &s;ilk, gown, generally blue; over which they have a black, or violet-coloured cloak, that almo&s;t touches their knees, made very wide, with wide and &s;hort &s;leeves.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">The colour of their mourning is white, among all cla&s;&s;es; the whole dre&s;s white. In the fir&s;t months of mourning for parentss, their habit is a kind of linen bag, of a bright red, and as coar&s;e as packing-cloth; the girdle of cord, and the cap of hempen cloth; but this is &s;ucceeded by the uniform, white dre&s;s.</P>
<P>A &s;on has no right to wear mourning whil&s;t his father and mother lives; but, when he mourns for them, it mu&s;t continue three years: and after this triennial mourn|ing is out, his dre&s;s, ever after, mu&s;t be of one colour. Silks and furs are forbidden to children, and the fir&s;t cap they wear, is pre&s;ented them by law, as to time of wear|ing, and is placed on their heads by the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, who addre&s;&s;es them in the following words. <Q>Con&s;ider that you now receive the dre&s;s of tho&s;e who have attained to maturity, and that you cea&s;e to be children: renounce, therefore, all childi&s;h thoughts and inclinations, a&s;&s;ume a grave and &s;erious deport|ment, apply your&s;elf clo&s;ely to the &s;tudy of virtue and wi&s;dom, and endeavour to merit a long and happy life.</Q> The Chine&s;e give a kind of importance to every thing that can in&s;pire youth with a ta&s;te for morality, and a love of good order. It might be u&s;eful to &s;ociety to re|mind men, at certain epochs of their lives, of the new duties impo&s;ed on them by each &s;ucce&s;&s;ive change: but by uniting the &s;olemnity of a public ceremony to this in|&s;truction, is certainly the way to make a greater im|pre&s;&s;ion, and imprint it longer on the memory.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24">In &s;hort, the law has regulated every thing, with re|&s;pect to dre&s;s, and even fixed the colours that di&s;tingui&s;h the different ranks. Emperors and princes of the blood alone, wear yellow. Certain mandarins are entitled to wear red &s;atin, on days of ceremony; but, at other times, they are cloathed in black, blue, or violet. Pea|cock's feather, in their caps, are al&s;o badges of di&s;tinc|tion; but none wear more than one, except the Empe|ror, and &s;ame few grandees, who wear two. The com|mon people are confined to blue, or black, and the dre&s;s is compo&s;ed always of plain, cotton cloth.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enlarge &s;o much on the female dre&s;s, which &s;eems, in &s;hape and form, to have been dictated by mo|de&s;ty, and &s;econded by jealou&s;y. Their robes are clo&s;e at top, reach to the chin, and &s;o long, as to cover their toes; in &s;hape like a powdering gown. The &s;levees, if not held up, would hang down to the ground; of cour&s;e, their hands are &s;eldom &s;een. A Chine&s;e woman con|ceals every thing but her face. As to colour of dre&s;s, this is arbitrary. Women in advanced life generally wear black, or violet-coloured.</P>
<P>Young women &s;eem to be acquainted with paint, at lea&s;t &s;uch paint as gives a bloom to their cheeks, and &s;ets off the delicacy of their complexions. It is not like Eu|ropean paint, except making the face &s;oon appear wrinkled.</P>

Some make part of it up into a roll, fa&s;ten it with &s;ilver bod|kins, and let the re&s;t flow down the neck in ringlets. In cold weather, in Peking, they wrap it round with a kind of black hood. <HI>Du Halde</HI> &s;ays, &s;ome ornament their heads with the figure of a fabulous bird, of which antiqui|ty has related many wonderful things. This bird is made of copper, or &s;ilver, gilt, according to the rank of tho&s;e who wear it; its wings extended, lie pretty clo&s;e to their head-dre&s;s before, embracing the upper part of their temples, while its long, &s;preading tail forms a kind of plume on the top of the head. Its body is di|rectly over the forehead, and the neck and tail hang down; but the former, being joined to the body by an invi&s;ible &s;wivel, plays freely about, and moves with the lea&s;t motion of the head. The whole bird adheres to the head by its claws, which are fixed in the hair. Ladies of the fir&s;t rank, &s;ometimes wear an ornament compo&s;ed of &s;everal of the&s;e birds, united together, form|ing a kind of crown.

<P>The Tartar Ladies dre&s;s &s;omewhat different from the Chine&s;e.

Salt and pepper are never brought to table, all meat being &s;ea&s;oned in the dre&s;&s;ing. They eat their fle&s;h boiled, fried, and broiled; but before it is &s;erved up, it is cut into little, &s;quare pieces, like d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. They u&s;e neither cloth, napkins, knives, &s;poon, or fork, but two, little, round, ebony &s;ticks, called
<PB N="25" REF="28">
chop-&s;ticks; &s;ometimes tipped at the ends with &s;ilver, with which they take up their meat very dextrou&s;ly; and, for their rice and broth, they hold the cup to their mouths, and lade it in with their chop-&s;ticks. Contrary to all ea&s;tern cu&s;toms, where per&s;ons &s;it cro&s;s-legged on the floor at meals, they u&s;e high chairs and tables. Al|mo&s;t every one has a &s;mall, lacquered table to him&s;elf, at an entertainment, on which he &s;ets his meat and rice, in little, china di&s;hes or &s;aucers, and &s;ometimes in plates.</P>
<P>Tea is their principal liquor; wine they have none, though the country abounds in fine grapes; neither do they brew beer from barley, but di&s;till &s;trong liquors from rice and wheat. Cold water they never drink, their water being generally bad, and not fit to be drank, until boiled and corrected, by the infu&s;ion of herbs, or mixed with &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The two principal &s;trong liquors our &s;eamen mention, who go that voyage, are <HI>Hock&s;hue</HI> and <HI>Sam&s;hue.</HI> The fir&s;t is of the colour of brown beer, but very clear and &s;trong; &s;aid to be an infu&s;ion of wheat, in &s;calding hot water, and ta&s;tes more like mum than beer. Sam&s;hue is a &s;pirit di&s;tilled from rice, a kind of arrack, and either of a pale or reddi&s;h colour, and is what &s;ome travellers have called wine. As to their tea, it is a beverage our &s;ailors leave to the natives, which they drink without &s;u|gar. In the morning, a large, tin ve&s;&s;el is made full of it, to &s;erve the family for that day. This tin ve&s;&s;el is
<PB N="26" REF="29">
covered very clo&s;e, and put into another ve&s;&s;el of wood, which keeps the tea warm all day, and is drawn off into cups by a cock. When company is in the hou&s;e, every per&s;on has a cup, with a clo&s;e cover, &s;et before him, and tea of &s;uch kind or quantity as the per&s;on plea&s;es, is put into it; after which, a per&s;on attends with a &s;aucepan of boiling water to pour into each cup.</P>
<P>The&s;e people generally eat their meat cold, but drink their liquor hot; and &s;o much ceremony is u&s;ed at their entertainments, that it mu&s;t very much le&s;&s;en the plea|&s;ure of eating and drinking; and the ceremonial of the invitation is no le&s;s complex and trouble&s;ome, than that of the entertainment. An invitation is not &s;up|po&s;ed to be given with &s;incerity, until it has been re|newed three or four times in writing. A card is &s;ent on the evening before, another in the morning of the ap|pointed day, and a third when every thing is prepared, and nothing to be done but to &s;it down to table. The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e always introduces his gue&s;ts into the hall, where he &s;alutes them, one after another. He then orders wine made from rice to be brought to him, in a &s;mall cup made of &s;ilver, porcelain, or &s;ome precious wood, and placed on a &s;mall, varni&s;hed &s;alver. He takes this in both hands, makes a bow to all the &s;urrounding com|pany, advances towards the fore-part of the hall, which generally looks into a large court, and rai&s;ing his eyes and the cup towards heaven, pours out the wine on
<PB N="27" REF="30">
the ground, in imitation of the well-known libations of antiquity.</P>
<P>This done, he pours fre&s;h wine into his cup, makes a bow to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;on pre&s;ent, and places <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the table &s;et apart for that gue&s;t, who, in re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for a cup of wine, and advances to place it on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> for the ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t, who en|deavours to prevent him, and makes a thou&s;and apolo|gies, according to the rules of Chine&s;e politene&s;s. At the&s;e fea&s;ts, each per&s;on has a table for him&s;elf, and the ma&s;ter's table is below all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>A &s;uperior dome&s;tic, or <HI>maitre d'hotel,</HI> conducts the chief gue&s;t to an elbow chair, covered with rich, flowered &s;ilk, who, after &s;ome apologies for taking the fir&s;t &s;eat, &s;its down. The re&s;t of the company follow his example, and &s;it without a&s;king, in order to abridge the ceremony. The principal place is always given to per&s;ons of greate&s;t age and dignity, and to a &s;tranger before all others, though younger, and of an inferior rank.</P>
<P>The tables are ranged in two lines, with a large &s;pace left between them. Scarcely are the company &s;eated, but four or five comedians, richly dre&s;&s;ed (I am &s;peaking of great entertainments), enter the hall; who all bow to|gether, &s;o low, that their heads touch the ground four times: after this, one of them pre&s;ents to the principal gue&s;t, a lift of the pieces they are able to perform <HI>extem|pore.</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="31">
The li&s;t is handed round, and again returned to him, and he then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> on the piece. The repre&s;enta|tion begins with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, covered with buffa|lo's hide, and the &s;ound of flutes, fifes, trumpets, and &s;ome other in&s;truments, u&s;ed by the Chine&s;e only, and which would, perhaps, little plea&s;e a European.</P>
<P>The hall-floor &s;erves the comedians for a &s;tage, which, on the&s;e occa&s;ion, di&s;covered with a carpet. The actors, about to perform, are placed in &s;ome of the adjoining apartments, from which they come forth, when they are to &s;peak; and the gue&s;ts pre&s;ent are the only &s;pectators. But it is u&s;ual for the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e to admit a cer|tain number of people into the court, to be partakers of the amu&s;ement: even women are indulged with a &s;ight al&s;o, through a &s;mall wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ket, made of interwoven bam|boos, covered with a &s;ilk net, through which they can &s;ee without being &s;een. The &s;ubject of the plays are generally the hi&s;tory of &s;ome &s;aint or hero.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e begin the&s;e repa&s;ts with drinking, and it mu&s;t be always pure wine, &s;uch as I have before men|tioned, and the <HI>Maitre d'hotel,</HI> falling down on one knee, invites the gue&s;ts to take a cup. Each then lays hold, with both hands, of that which is placed before him, lifts it as high as his forehead, then lowers it below the table, and afterwards put, it to his mouth. They all drink to|gether very &s;lowly, and at three or four draughts; the ma&s;ter inducing them to drink the whole, by &s;hewing
<PB N="29" REF="32">
them the bottom of his cup, that he has done &s;o. If any one don't care to drink, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould go through all the motions, and hold his cup to his head, as long as the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It is whil&s;t they are drinking, always, that the dome&s;|tics remove the di&s;hes from the table, and bring in others. Every per&s;on has 24 di&s;hes, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;erved up to him, all of which are fat, and in the form of ra|gouts. They never begin to eat, until the ma&s;ter leads the way, and &s;o through every fre&s;h di&s;h. When the ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t gives the &s;ignal, their two chop&s;ticks are taken up, and flouri&s;hed; they then &s;trike the di&s;h with them, and carry them to their mouths, all in regular, uniform motion, as if they were exerci&s;ing. They are to take as much care as po&s;&s;ible, that their mouths all move toge|ther; for to be before-hand, or make the re&s;t wait, is a piece of rudene&s;s. When they have thus taken two or three mouthfuls of a di&s;h, the &s;ignal is given by the ma&s;|ter, and they all lay down their arms. After this they drink as before.</P>
<P>During this bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ays <HI>Le Comte,</HI> they never &s;peak and will be &s;ilent at table three or four hours, for they continue eating till tea is introduced; after which they ri&s;e, take a turn or two in the garden or hou&s;e, and then return to the dining-room, where they find a de&s;ert of &s;weetmeats. This de&s;ert, like the dinner, con&s;i&s;ts of 24 different things; pre&s;erved fruits, hams and &s;allad, ducks
<PB N="30" REF="33">
dried in the &s;un, with &s;heil and other kinds of &s;mall fi&s;h. The &s;ame ceremonies are again attended to, but the larger cups of wine are brought; no per&s;on is, however, urged to drink more than he likes, provided all the mo|tions are gone through. The&s;e entertainments begin at the clo&s;e of the day, and never end till midnight. As it was cu&s;tomary in England to give money to &s;ervants, &s;o it is here; the quality of the entertainer date mines the &s;um, and this little contribution is always carried to the ma&s;ter, who di&s;tributes it among his &s;ervants: but mo|ney is only given when the entertainment has been ac|companied with a comedy.</P>
<P>Each returns home in a chair, preceded by &s;everal per&s;ons, who carry large lanth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rns of oiled paper, on which the quality, and &s;ome times the name of their ma&s;ter is in&s;cribed in large characters. Whoever ven|tures to go abroad, at &s;uch an hour, without &s;uch an at|tendance, would be &s;topped by the guard. The next day a card of thanks is returned to the officer of the watch.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e have the &s;ecret of &s;alting large quanti|ties of their fle&s;h in &s;uch a manner, that it lo&s;es nothing of its original flavour, they al&s;o &s;alt their eggs, by co|vering them with a coat of clay, mixed with &s;alt: and &s;o &s;alted they will keep for years.

alone, impregnated with &s;alt has this property. The&s;e &s;alted eggs are very whole&s;ome, and even &s;ick per&s;ons are permitted to eat them.</P>
<P>We have already &s;aid, that all their di&s;hes are in the form of ragouts, but all very different in ta&s;te, highly &s;ea&s;oned, and much le&s;s expen&s;ive than ours. French cooks, &s;ays <HI>Du Halde,</HI> who have refined upon every thing that can awaken and excite the appetite, would be much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee that the Chine&s;e have carried the powers of invention, with re&s;pect to ragouts, much far|ther than they, and at a much &s;maller expence. Spices and &s;trong herbs, combined in different proportions, pro|duce this variety.</P>
<P>Of all the di&s;hes &s;erved up at the entertainments of the great, none are more e&s;teemed than &s;tag's &s;inews, and the ne&s;ts of a particular &s;pecies of birds. The former they dry in the &s;un, afterwards cover them with nutmeg and pepper, and &s;hut them in a clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el for u&s;e. When they dre&s;s them, they &s;teep them in rice-water, to &s;often them, &s;tew them in kid-broth, and &s;ea&s;on them with a variety of &s;pices.</P>
<P>The ne&s;ts are procured from the rocks, and are made by a bird &s;omething like our &s;wallows, and in the &s;ame way; not with clay, but &s;mall fi&s;hes, which they have the art of cementing together with a kind of &s;cum, that is found floating on the &s;urface of the &s;ea. The&s;e ne&s;ts
<PB N="32" REF="35">
are torn from the rocks as &s;oon as the young ones have taken flight; whole barks are loaded with them, and they become a very profitable branch of commerce, for the in|habitants of tho&s;e places. The property of this food, is to give an agreeable reli&s;h to whatever is mixed with it.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the &s;outhern provinces feed more on rice than wheat, though there is abundance of the lat|ter in the country: they make it into &s;mall loaves, and bake them in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour, by holding them over the &s;team of boiling water; which makes them exceedingly &s;oft and tender. They al&s;o make thin cakes of wheat, mixed with herbs, that is very plea&s;ant to the ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Their wine has no re&s;emblance to ours, as to ta&s;te or quality. It is made from rice, by &s;leeping and boiling it: and they di&s;til a &s;pirit from the fle&s;h of &s;heep. The Chine&s;e are naturally &s;ober. Citizens in ea&s;y circum|&s;tances, live chiefly upon pork, eating it every day; but this meat is ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion, and more agreeable to the ta&s;te than ours. Chine&s;e hams are in great e&s;timation.</P>
<P>The ceremonies of the Chine&s;e are part of their con|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itution. Every man is obliged to ob&s;erve them. Even trade&s;men, &s;ervants, &s;eamen, and hu&s;bandmen have their re&s;pective forms a&s;&s;igned them, which the &s;tate conceives tend much to their civilization; and that the frequent u&s;e of the many, outward conde&s;cen&s;ions and mild ex|pre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="33" REF="36">
enjoined by government, and the &s;eeming af|fection they are taught to expre&s;s for one another, tends to promote peace and order, and produce mutual good-will; and that the forbearance of &s;currilous and provok|ing language, prevents many quarrels. Oaths and ob|&s;cene di&s;cour&s;e are never heard among them.</P>
<P>But the ceremonies of the Chine&s;e depend more upon po&s;itive laws than cu&s;tom. The law has regulated every thing on this head. Every one, from the highe&s;t man|darin, to the humble&s;t individual, is perfectly acquainted with the titles he mu&s;t give to others, and what is due to him&s;elf; the honours and compliments he can accept, and tho&s;e which he ought to pay. In China there are no di&s;putes about rank or precedency. Every one knows his &s;ituation, and, as among our people of quality, take the lead according to their rank.</P>
<P>A vi&s;it in China, is a bu&s;ine&s;s of great &s;olemnity, re|quiring formal preliminaries, which Europeans are un|acquainted with. Familiar friends vi&s;it without much ceremony, but for all others there is a form pre&s;cribed. Vi&s;its from the inhabitants of any city to a governor, are always attended with pre&s;ents. As &s;oon as the vi&s;itors reach the hall where the governor gives audience, they all range them&s;elves in a line, make a profound reve|rence on his coming in, throw them&s;elves on their knees, and bend their heads even to the earth, unle&s;s rai&s;ed up by the governor, which is generally done. Sometimes
<PB N="34" REF="37">
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable among them takes a cup of wine, in both hands, and pre&s;ents it to the governor, pronounc|ing aloud, by way of prayer, <HI>To-&s;iou!</HI> that is, Behold the wine which brings happine&s;s! or <HI>Cheou-t&s;iou!</HI> Behold the wine that brings length of days! After him, another advances with &s;weetmeats, pre&s;enting them with, "Be|hold the &s;ugar of long-life!" Others repeat the &s;ame ceremonies three times, with the &s;ame wi&s;hes. When a governor has any way di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, the <HI>literati</HI> of his di&s;trict, cau&s;e a dre&s;s to be made for him, com|po&s;ed of &s;quare pieces of different coloured &s;atin, and pre&s;ent to him on his birth-day, amid&s;t the &s;ound of &s;e|veral mu&s;ical in&s;truments, and puts it over him. This ve&s;tment is worn but once, but pre&s;erved in his family as a badge of di&s;tinction, and is made up of &s;o many dif|ferent colours, to repre&s;ent different nations, and to in|form the mandarin he is worthy of ruling them all.</P>
<P>A vi&s;it to a &s;uperior is always made before dinner, be|fore the vi&s;itor has ta&s;ted wine; the &s;mell of &s;uch a thing would be a gro&s;s affront; but if a vi&s;it is returned the &s;ame day, it may be after dinner. No per&s;on can pay a vi&s;it without previou&s;ly &s;ending a card to the porter of the per&s;on the vi&s;it is to be made to. This card is of red paper, ornamented with flowers and folded like a &s;creen, the vi&s;itor's name is written in one of the folds, and many re&s;pectful expre&s;&s;ions in the other. If the vi&s;it is to an intimate friend, or per&s;on of ordinary rank, the <HI>Tie t&s;&eacute;e,</HI> or vi&s;iting-card, is only a leaf of plain paper;
<PB N="35" REF="38">
if the per&s;on &s;ent to is in mourning, a leaf of black paper. Sometimes the&s;e vi&s;its, as in England, are made and re|turned, by merely &s;ending the card.</P>
<P>When the vi&s;itor arrives at the hou&s;e of a &s;uperior, he is introduced into the hall by a couple of &s;ervants, who hold an umbrella and their ma&s;ter's fan, inclined to each other, &s;o as to form a &s;creen, behind which the vi|&s;itor &s;tands, concealed likewi&s;e behind a large fan, which an attendant of his own holds up before him, and the&s;e barriers are not removed until the vi&s;itor has advanced near enough to the ma&s;ter if the hou&s;e to &s;alute him, who never moves from his chair. If the per&s;on vi&s;ited be much the inferior, he goes out into the &s;treet to conduct the &s;tranger in, they bow low to each other as &s;oon as they meet, and a &s;et of &s;hort compliments are pre&s;cribed; one knows what he is to &s;ay, the other what to an&s;wer: at every door, they halt and bow, and di&s;pute who &s;hall enter fir&s;t. But few expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed on this occa|&s;ion: one &s;ays <HI>T&s;in,</HI> which is, Pray walk in; the other, <HI>Pau can,</HI> It mu&s;t not be. This being repeated four or five times, the &s;tranger &s;uffers him&s;elf to be overcome, and goes to the next room-door, where the &s;ame ceremo|ny is repeated.</P>
<P>When the vi&s;itor, or vi&s;itors are all entered, then com|mence all tho&s;e formalities, which are &s;o minutely pointed out in the Chine&s;e book of ceremonies. This book de|termines the number of &s;alutations to be made, by bend|ing
<PB N="36" REF="39">
the head towards the brea&s;t, the complimentary ex|pre&s;&s;ions that mu&s;t be u&s;ed, the reciprocal bendings of the knee that each mu&s;t make, the &s;teps to be taken to the right or left, and the manner of pre&s;enting the right hand. All this gone through, they bow to the chairs, du&s;t them with their great &s;leeves, and, after a quarter of an hour's grimace, &s;eat them&s;elves oppo&s;ite to each other. They are obliged to &s;it upright, without leaning, with down-ca&s;t looks, their hands &s;tretched out on their knees and their feet even: they are to look grave and compo&s;ed, and not be too talkative. &s;ometimes not a word is &s;aid but the pre&s;cribed compliments, which are &s;poken with all imaginary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and always in the third per&s;on; as, "The favour your lord&s;hip has done one &s;o much beneath him, lays his &s;ervant under the highe&s;t obligations." "Permit the &s;ervant to offer his lord this curio&s;ity, which his poor country affords." They never &s;ay <HI>I</HI> or <HI>you,</HI> but <HI>your &s;ervant,</HI> or <HI>your &s;cholar,</HI> and the <HI>Doctor,</HI> or <HI>my Lord,</HI> &s;aid this; not <HI>you</HI> &s;aid it, <HI>you</HI> did it. Such familiar expre&s;&s;ions would be rude and vul|gar. They &s;eldom fatigue them&s;elves with talking: in|deed, they affect &s;o much gravity, and &s;ay &s;o little in com|pany, that they re&s;emble &s;tatues, or figures placed in chairs, for ornament. One mi&s;&s;ionary avers, that a man|darin paid him a vi&s;it, and did not open his mouth the whole time he was with him. But to return:</P>
<P>A little time after, as many cups of tea are brought in, as there are per&s;ons pre&s;ent; and the manner of taking
<PB N="37" REF="40">
up the cup, conveying it to the mouth, and returning it to the &s;ervant, form &s;o many articles of this book of ce|remonies, and are always performed with the mo&s;t rigid minutene&s;s and punctuality. Amba&s;&s;adors are allowed ma&s;ters of the ceremonies, to in&s;truct them 40 days be|fore they are admitted to an audience, that they may not commit blunders; and many of the Chine&s;e will be of|fended, even with &s;trangers, if they omit to fawn and cringe, according to the rules pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The ceremonies at departure are equally formal. The ma&s;ter of the ceremonies conducts you to your chair, waits till you are taken up, and bids you adieu. In &s;alut|ing each other, they never uncover their heads. To be bare-headed, they con&s;ider as indecent; and in con|formity to this national cu&s;tom, the Pope thought fit to di&s;pen&s;e with the converts appearing, in the chri&s;tian churches in China, bare-headed. The u&s;e of pearls is forbidden in China, and if any pre&s;ents are &s;ent, and not accepted, as is often the ca&s;e, they are always returned, with a note of thanks, and <HI>Pi-fie,</HI> that is, "The&s;e are pearls; I dare not touch them." Or, if &s;ome are kept, and others returned, it is with <HI>Yu-pi,</HI> or, "With regard to the re&s;t, they are valuable pearls."</P>
<P>When a &s;tranger is about to take hor&s;e, after a vi&s;it, and return home, this cannot be effected without great ceremony, for he will not be &s;o rude as to mount before the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e; who, on the contrary, urges
<PB N="38" REF="41">
him to it. The &s;tranger then prote&s;ts, that the world &s;hall be turned up&s;ide down, before he will be &s;o rude. The ma&s;ter rather &s;uffers this, retires out of &s;ight, and, when his vi&s;itor is &s;eated in his &s;addle, returns, and bids him adieu. And when the &s;tranger is gone a little way, a &s;ervant is di&s;patched after him, to wi&s;h him a good journey.</P>
<P>Epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence, even among private friends, is always attended with e&s;tabli&s;hed ceremonies, which are more complicated. If a letter is written to a per&s;on of rank, it is then nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e a piece of white paper, with ten or twelve folds; the letter mu&s;t begin in the &s;e|cond, and the &s;ignature be written in the la&s;t. Even the characters u&s;ed, differ according to circum&s;tances. The &s;maller they are, the more re&s;pectful. The &s;tyle, the words u&s;ed, and the di&s;tance u&s;ed between the lines, are al&s;o to be &s;uited to the rank of the per&s;on wrote to. Two &s;eals mu&s;t be affixed to the letter, one over the &s;ignature, and the other over the beginning. When written, &s;uch letter is folded in a cover, ornamented with flowers, as is now adopted in France. In this is written, <HI>Nay-han,</HI> "The letter is within;" and this put into another cover, directed, clo&s;ed, and &s;ealed at both ends, with the words <HI>Hou fong,</HI> "&s;ecured and &s;ealed."</P>
<P>The form of &s;alutation in China, even among per&s;ons of moderate rank, is much le&s;s expeditious than ours. A common &s;alute con&s;i&s;ts in joining both hands together
<PB N="39" REF="42">
before the brea&s;t, moving them in an affectionate man|ner, bending the head a little, and &s;aying, reciprocally, <HI>T&s;in-T&s;in,</HI> pronounced <HI>Chin-chin,</HI> a complimentary word, &s;omething like your humble &s;ervant, but which means no <HI>humility.</HI> When a per&s;on meets one of &s;uperior rank, he joins his hands by locking the fingers together, rai&s;es them above the forehead, and afterwards, brings them down towards the earth, making a profound bow with the whole body. When two friends meet, after a long ab|&s;ence, they both fall on their knees oppo&s;ite to each other, bend their bodies to the earth, then rai&s;e them up, and repeat the &s;ame two or three times. At an ordinary in|terview, the common phra&s;e is, "How d'ye do? And the an&s;wer is, <HI>Cao-lao-ye-hung-fo,</HI> "Well; thanks to your abundant felicity." When they &s;ee a man in good health, the fir&s;t addre&s;s is, <HI>Yung-fo,</HI> that is, "Pro&s;perity is painted in your looks;" or, "You have a happy coun|tenance."</P>
<P>When two mandarins of royal rank meet in the &s;treet, in their chairs, each joins his hands as before, lowers them down, and then rai&s;es them to his forehead, and repeats this till they are out of each other's &s;ight. But if one of the two be of higher rank than the other, the latter orders his chair to &s;top; or, if he is on hor&s;eback he di&s;mounts, and makes a profound bow to his &s;upe|rior. I have &s;een this with gentlemen in England, and the &s;ame compliment paid by a gentleman to a lady. In a word, politene&s;s in China is as general in villages as in
<PB N="40" REF="43">
towns, and being e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, is attended with as little &s;incerity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n one as the other. When a per&s;on pays his obedience to the Emperor, he falls on his knees, and then throws him&s;elf pro&s;trate on the ground, after the A&s;iatic manner, as is repre&s;ented in the plate of the Chine&s;e &s;epulchre.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Their Cu&s;toms and Manners continued.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL now &s;peak of their amu&s;ements. As the Chine&s;e generally employ their hours in the duties of &s;ociety, they have little inclination or time for amu&s;e|ments. Being naturally a grave people, they &s;eldom a&s;|&s;ume an air of gaiety, but in conformity to cu&s;tom. They have no public theatres. Their comedians and tragedi|ans are merely &s;trollers, that go about from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, performing for tho&s;e who are able to pay them.</P>
<P>But plays are &s;ometimes performed in the public &s;treets, on open &s;caffolds, and in half a dozen &s;treets at a time. The&s;e actors are richly dre&s;&s;ed, have a large ward|robe, and great variety. On each &s;ide of the &s;tages are &s;creens, but they have no painted &s;cenes. When they act in the &s;treets, they are paid by the inhabitants of that &s;treet; when they act in temples, as &s;ometimes they do,
<PB N="41" REF="44">
they are paid by the members of that temple. No wo|men appearing on the &s;tage, female parts are performed by boys, or young men of an effeminate ca&s;t. Some companies of players con&s;i&s;t of young men from 20 to 40 years of age: the&s;e the Chine&s;e e&s;teem mo&s;t; but Europeans admire tho&s;e between 12 and 18. Their tra|gic actors &s;eem to act with great propriety, &s;o as to af|fect the pa&s;&s;ions of a European &s;pectator, though he is ignorant of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> language. It is the plea of inculcating virtue and ridiculing vice, that induces the &s;tate to &s;uffer them to perform.</P>
<P>The whole &s;treets are &s;o filled on the&s;e occa&s;ions, with a plea&s;ed and an attentive crowd, that there is no pa&s;&s;ing. When an actor plays his part well, he is always encored. Plays are generally concluded with tumbling, fighting, or combating with giants or wild bea&s;ts, or el&s;e with &s;ome humourous po&s;tures, antic feats and expre&s;&s;ions, which create a laugh.</P>
<P>Gaming, and every diver&s;ion that tends to promote or encourage idlene&s;s, is ab&s;olutely forbidden to young people; but there are in&s;tances of grown per&s;ons who have followed it &s;o immoderately, that they have played away their e&s;tates, wives, and children; any of which they will &s;ometimes hazard on a card, or the &s;ingle ca&s;t of a die; but, in general, they are ignorant of all games at China.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="45">The Chine&s;e call che&s;s the game of the elephant, and &s;ay, they had it from the Indians, about 537. Young maidens are here taught che&s;s, and it is reckoned a part of their education, holding the &s;ame place as dancing does with us.</P>
<P>Cock-fighting is a favourite diver&s;ion, and hunting, which the gentry of England endeavour to confine to them&s;elves, is free to every one in China. Such per&s;ons as wi&s;h to enjoy the diver&s;ion alone, &s;hut up a quantity of game in parks for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When the Emperor goes a hunting, he &s;elects 30,000 of his life-guards, who are armed with darts and javelins. The&s;e he di&s;po&s;es in &s;uch a manner, that they quite &s;ur|round a very large extent of ground, upon the mountains. The guards thus po&s;ted, form a large circle, marching nearer to each other with an equal pace, taking care not to quit their ranks; the circle is thus reduced to a much &s;maller one, and the bea&s;ts inclo&s;ed by the great circle, are taken in the &s;maller one, as in a net; for now, the guards alighting from their hor&s;es, keep &s;o very clo&s;e to each other, that not the &s;malle&s;t out-let is left for any wild-bea&s;t to e&s;cape. The animals, in this &s;mall circle, are hunted &s;o clo&s;e, that the poor creatures, quite &s;pent, come and fall down at the feet of the hunters, and are thus taken with ea&s;e. Sometimes they will thus take two or 300 hares, and a prodigious number of wolves and foxes.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="46">Once a year the Emperor goes into Tartary to hunt, and, at the&s;e times, often meets with tygers, which are the fierce&s;t animals they have; but, fierce as they are, when they find them&s;elves enclo&s;ed by a circle of hunters, they &s;eem to be &s;truck with a kind of terror, at the &s;ight of &s;uch a number of enemies, all ready to direct the points of their lances again&s;t them. Far from imitating the &s;tag and other animals, which &s;o hemmed in, run up and down without cea&s;ing, and try every means to e&s;cape, the tyger &s;quats down, and endures for a long time, with|out moving, the barking of the dogs, which are let loo&s;e upon him; but afterwards, excited, either by exce&s;s of rage, or the nece&s;&s;ity of defending him&s;elf, he darts for|ward with prodigious leaps, and incredible rapidity, to &s;ome particular part, which he has fixed on, and attacks the hunters on that part; but they receive him with the points of their lances, and plunge them into his belly, at the moment he is preparing to &s;eize &s;ome one of them.</P>
<P>Strangers are a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee the boldne&s;s and intre|pidity &s;hewn by the Tartar hor&s;es, when they meet with any of the&s;e tygers. They, at fir&s;t, appear frighted at the horrid cries of tho&s;e terrible animals, but become in&s;en&s;ibly accu&s;tomed to hear and &s;ee them, and their ma&s;ters take great pains to inure them to this kind of hunting. The metal of &s;uch a hor&s;e, I have already de|&s;cribed at a bear-chace. <HI>See the Plate, vol.</HI> 4, <HI>p.</HI> 186.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="47">Fi&s;hery is con&s;idered rather as an object of commerce than amu&s;ement. But the &s;oldiers have a method of fi&s;hing with a bow and arrow. The arrow being fixed to the bow by a &s;tring, is &s;hot: if they hit their mark, the &s;tring enables them to draw the fi&s;h to them; if not, it prevents the arrow from being lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e can enjoy no amu&s;ements but tho&s;e au|thori&s;ed by law re&s;pecting ceremonies. Their annual, pub|lic entertainments are e&s;tabli&s;hed by cu&s;tom, in every city of the third cla&s;s, and the law has determined what degree of people &s;hall be admitted to them. They mu&s;t be either graduate doctors of un&s;potted reputation, man|darins of law or arms, who have retired from public life; aged heads of families, or citizens di&s;tingui&s;hed for pro|bity and virtue.. This in&s;titution is principally intended to pre&s;erve that mutual regard and friend&s;hip which is too often forgot in other countries. The&s;e entertainments con&s;i&s;t of eating and drinking and mu&s;ic, and are a kind of love-fea&s;ts, regulated in the minute&s;t manner, by a mandarin, acording to an e&s;tabli&s;hed ceremony. At the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, &s;ome articles of the law are read, and the pre&s;ident adds, in the name, and by order of the Emperor, words to this effect. <Q>If we have been a&s;|&s;embled here to this &s;olemn fe&s;tival, it is not &s;o much for the plea&s;ure of eating and drinking, as to encou|rage us to &s;hew fidelity to our prince, piety to our parents, affection to our brothers and &s;i&s;ters, e&s;teem for our elders, re&s;pect for our relations, an attachment
<PB N="45" REF="48">
our friends, and a de&s;ire to promote peace and concord among our fellow-citizens and neighbours.</Q> And the airs which are &s;ung, and the mu&s;ic which accompanies them, all tend to the &s;ame end; to harmonize and con|ciliate univer&s;al benevolence and affection. Such a ban|quet may be truly called, a fea&s;t of love, an a&s;&s;embly of in&s;truction!</P>
<P>We have already &s;een in what manner the Emperor of China celebrates the vernal fe&s;tival. This is cele|brated on the &s;ame day, throughout the empire, in a way &s;omewhat different, but tending to the &s;ame end; name|ly, the encouragement of moral labour and indu&s;try. In the morning, the governor of every city, comes forth from his palace, crowned with a chaplet of flowers, and enters his chair, in which he is carried, preceded by mu&s;ic, and a number of &s;tandard-bearers, lighted flam|beaux, &amp;c. &s;urrounded and followed by &s;everal litters, covered with &s;ilk carpets, on which are effigies of &s;ome illu&s;trious per&s;ons who have encouraged hu&s;bandry; or &s;ome hi&s;torical painting, on the &s;ame &s;ubject. The hou&s;es are hung with carpeting; triumphal arches are erected at certain di&s;tances; lantherns every where di&s;play|ed, and all the hou&s;es illuminated. A figure, made of baked earth, repre&s;enting a cow, richly cloathed, with gilt horns, is al&s;o carried in proce&s;&s;ion; and, &s;o large, that 40 men &s;ometimes can &s;carce &s;upport it. A child, with one foot naked, and the other &s;hod, called, the "Spirit of labour and diligence," follows, driving on the image
<PB N="46" REF="49">
with a rod. Labourers, with all the implements of hu&s;bandry, march behind; and a troop of comedians, and people ma&s;ked, who&s;e grote&s;que appearance and at|titudes afford much entertainment to the populace, bring up the rear.</P>
<P>The governor thus advances to the ea&s;tern gate, as if he intended to meet the &s;pring; and then returns to his palace, in the &s;ame order. After this, the cow is &s;trip|ped of her ornaments, and a great number of earthen calves are taken from her belly, which are di&s;tributed among the crowd. The cow her&s;elf is broken into pieces, and di&s;tributed in like manner; and the whole is concluded with a &s;peech from the governor, in prai&s;e of agriculture, and an exhortation to the people, not to neg|lect &s;o u&s;eful and valuable an art.</P>
<P>They have two other fe&s;tivals, celebrated at a pro|digious expence: one at the commencement of the year, which they call, "Taking leave of the old year; and, the other, on the 15th of the fir&s;t month, called, "The fea&s;t of lantherns." At the&s;e times all bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;top|ped, and the tribunals are &s;hut up throughout the em|pire. At the conclu&s;ion of the old year al&s;o, all bu&s;ine&s;s, whether private or public, is &s;u&s;pended; pre&s;ents are given and received; inferior mandarins go and pay their re&s;pects to their &s;uperiors; children to their parents, and &s;ervants to their ma&s;ters; all dre&s;&s;ed in their be&s;t attire: &s;omething &s;imilar to the vi&s;its paid in France, on new-year's

day. All the family a&s;&s;emble in the evening, and partake of a grand repa&s;t; but no &s;tranger is admitted, not one of their neare&s;t relations, from a &s;uper&s;titious opinion, that they may rob the family of that good for|tune which de&s;cends on the hou&s;e, with the fir&s;t moment of the new year: but, on the next and following days, they give lively demon&s;trations of extraordinary joy. Every &s;hop is &s;hut; fea&s;ting and carou&s;ing is univer&s;al; every one appears in his be&s;t dre&s;s; vi&s;its are made to re|lations and friends; plays are acted; the whole empire is is in motion, and nothing goes forward but mirth and rejoicing.</P>
<P>On the fea&s;t of lantherns, every place throughout the empire is &s;o illuminated, that if one could take a view of it from &s;ome high place, all the country would &s;eem in a blaze. The fe&s;tival begins on the 13th in the even|ing, and is continued to the 17th. Every per&s;on, both in city and country, on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and on the rivers, light up painted lantherns, of &s;everal fa&s;hions and &s;izes; even the poore&s;t families hang them up in their court|yards, and at their windows. The wealthy will expend 10 or 15&pound;. Engli&s;h, on this occa&s;ion; and the chief mandarins, the viceroys, and Emperor, will &s;pend two or three hundred.</P>
<P>It is a &s;pectacle to all the cities; people flock there from all parts, and the gates of the city are left open every evening to receive them.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="51">The&s;e lantherns are very large, &s;ome &s;quare, &s;ome &s;exagon, and &s;ome octagon; the frame wood, and co|vered with tran&s;parent &s;ilk, on which is painted flowers, animals and human figures; others are round, and made of a blue, tran&s;parent kind of horn. Many lamps, and wax candles, are put into the&s;e lantherns; to the corner of each are fixed &s;treamers of &s;atin and &s;ilk, of different colours, and a curious piece of carved work is placed over its top.</P>
<P>Some of the large lantherns exhibit moving figures, in imitation of the <HI>Ombres Chinoi&s;es,</HI> or Chine&s;e &s;hades, that have been &s;hewn in London. People, who lie con|cealed, by means of imperceptible threads, put the figures in motion; and we &s;ee hor&s;es galloping, &s;hips &s;ailing, ar|mies marching, groupes dancing, and a variety of &s;pec|tacles that amu&s;e and divert the people. Some accom|pany the&s;e moving figures with droll expre&s;&s;ions, that &s;eem to proceed from the &s;hades on the lanthern: others, carry about &s;erpents and dragons, 60 or 80 feet long, illuminated within from the head to the tail, and have the art of making them twi&s;t them&s;elves in different forms, like real &s;erpents.</P>
<P>But that which adds new and additional &s;plendor to this fe&s;tival, are the various fire-works the Chine&s;e are cele|brated for. <HI>Magailens</HI> &s;ays, that he was &s;urpri&s;ed at one of the&s;e exhibitions, where an arbor of vines, with red grapes, was repre&s;ented, and the arbor burnt without being
<PB N="49" REF="52">
con&s;umed. The red grapes, the green leaves, and the colour of the wood, was &s;o naturally repre&s;ented, that any per&s;on might have taken them for real. But their excel|lence in this art may be better judged, from a de&s;cription of one that was exhibited by the late Emperor, <HI>Chang-hi,</HI> for the diver&s;ion of the court. The fire-works began with half-a-dozen large cylinders planted in the ground, which formed in the air, &s;o many &s;treams of flames, ri&s;ing to the height of 12 feet, and falling in &s;howers of golden fire. This was followed by a covered box, &s;up|ported by two pillars, which threw up a &s;hower of fire; with &s;everal lantherns, and &s;entences written in large cha|racters of burning &s;ulphur, and afterwards, &s;ix branched candle&s;ticks, forming pillars, with different tiers of &s;ilver-coloured lights, ranged in circles, &s;o brilliant, as to convert night into day. At la&s;t, the Emperor &s;et fire him&s;elf to one of the works, that was in&s;tantly communicated to all &s;ides of the place, which was 80 feet long and 50 broad. The fire reached &s;everal poles and painted figures, from whence proceeded a prodigious multitude of &s;ky-rockets, and at the &s;ame time, a num|ber of lantherns and branched candle&s;ticks were lighted in every place. The Engli&s;h arti&s;ts, in artificial fire, have reached this excellence; and will light many thou&s;and lamps, almo&s;t at one and the &s;ame time, by means of quick-match, which is a &s;tring of cotton, loaded with gun|powder, and enclo&s;ed in paper pipes, communicating with every lamp.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="53">The Chine&s;e endeavour to render every public cere|mony as grand and &s;triking as po&s;&s;ible. A viceroy never quits his palace, or travels, but with a pomp truly royal. His common &s;uite con&s;i&s;ts of 100 men: he is then dre&s;&s;ed in his official robes, and carried in a &s;umptuous, gilt chair, on the &s;houlders of eight dome&s;tics, preceded by guards, and two drummers, beating on copper ba&s;ons. Eight others carry &s;tandards of varni&s;hed wood, on which are in&s;cribed, in large characters, all his titles of honour. The&s;e are followed with 14 flags, &s;ymbols of his office; &s;ix officers, bearing boards, with in&s;criptions of gold, de|claring the good qualities of the viceroy; and two, carry|ing a triple umbrella, of yellow &s;ilk, and its cover. Two archers, on hor&s;eback, precede the fir&s;t body of guards; the latter are followed by others, armed. Behind the&s;e, are two other parties of &s;oldiers; &s;ome carrying large maces, &s;ome iron &s;pikes, and others huge hammers; and others again, behind them, bearing battle-axes, of different kinds. After the&s;e, proceed another party of &s;oldiers, differently armed, with triple-pointed &s;pears, bows and ar|rows, and followed by two men, bearing the viceroy's &s;eal, in a kind of box. Then come two other drummers, announcing his approach, followed by two officers, with plumes of feathers, and two others, bearing maces of gilt dragons; next, a number of magi&s;trates and officers of ju&s;tice, in &s;ilk &s;carfs, with whips, chains, and hangers. Two &s;tandard-bearers command this party, which imme|diately precedes the governor. Pages and footmen &s;ur|round his chair; and an officer attends him, carrying a

<P>If he marches in the night, large, beautiful lantherns are carried before him; on the tran&s;parent part of which, his quality, titles, &amp;c. are written in large characters, to tell the public who is coming; that pa&s;&s;engers may &s;top, and &s;uch as are &s;itting, ri&s;e up with re&s;pect.

<P>But, when the Emperor goes forth on any public oc|ca&s;ion, the following is the proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Twenty-four drummers, two and two.</P>
<P>Twenty-four trumpeters, two and two; their trumpets three feet long, and eight inches diameter, at the lower end; made of the wood Ou-tong-chu, and ornamented with rings of gold: their &s;hape is &s;omething like a bell.</P>

<P>Four hundred large beautiful lantherns of elegant workman&s;hip, borne by as many men, and containing each a flambeaux, made of a wood which burns long, and gives a great light.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="55">Two hundred men, &s;ome carrying lances, ornamented with tufts of different coloured &s;ilks, and others tails of foxes, panthers, and other animals.</P>
<P>Twenty-four banners, on which are painted the &s;igns of the zodiac, which the Chine&s;e divide into 24 parts.</P>
<P>Fifty-&s;ix other banners, repre&s;enting different clu&s;ters of &s;tars, according to their arrangement in the heavens.</P>
<P>Two hundred fans, &s;upported by long, gilded poles, with the figures of different animals painted on them.</P>
<P>The Emperor, &s;uperbly dre&s;&s;ed, on a beautiful hor&s;e, richly capari&s;oned; and a &s;uperb umbrella, of a prodigious &s;ize, held over him, that covers both him and his hor&s;e, and &s;helters them from the &s;un: 100 lance-bearers; pages of the bed-chamber, and 10 valets each, with a led hor&s;e, &s;urround the monarch, the bridles and &s;addles or|namented with gold and precious &s;tones.</P>
<P>All the princes of the blood, nobility, chief mandarins, and &s;tate-officers, two and two, in their habits of ce|remony.</P>
<P>Five hundred young gentlemen belonging to the pa|lace, richly dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and footmen, in red robes, inter&s;per&s;ed with flowers and &s;tars, embroidered in gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>An open chair, carried by 36 men, and guarded by 50.</P>
<P>A large chair, but &s;hut, carried by 120 men, and guarded by 50.</P>

<P>European &s;overeigns have been attended by many thou|&s;ands of per&s;ons, but never by 2000 <HI>literati</HI> among the number.</P>
<P>Chine&s;e hor&s;es are not only beautiful, but their harne&s;s is magnificent; the bits and the &s;tirrups being either &s;ilver, or gilt. The &s;addle is very rich, and the reins are made of &s;titched &s;atin, two fingers broad. From the upper part of the che&s;t, hang two large tufts of fine, red hair, &s;uch as their caps are covered with, and the&s;e tufts are &s;u&s;pended by iron rings, gilt or &s;ilvered. When the grandees ride out, they are always preceded and followed by a great number of hor&s;emen, who form their retinue, without reckoning their dome&s;tics, and who, according to the quality of their ma&s;ters, are cloathed in black &s;atin, or dyed callico.</P>
<P>Their chairs are a kind of &s;edan, like ours, made of bamboo, but have no gla&s;s. Tho&s;e in which the ladies are carried, are always provided with a lattice, or blind. to prevent their &s;eeing, or being &s;een. A piece of wood is placed a-cro&s;s, from the end of one pole to the other, which the chairmen lay upon their &s;houlders. Their carriages are &s;omething like our jocky-carts, drawn by two,

or more hor&s;es, a-brea&s;t, and conducted by a driver on foot, except when they travel expeditiou&s;ly; in which ca&s;e, the driver rides in the carriage, and conducts the hor&s;es with reins, the carriage being wide enough to hold two. The&s;e carriages have only two wheels, &s;ome but one in the center underneath, are open, with an um|brella fixed behind; but tho&s;e in which ladies are car|ried, are covered and clo&s;e &s;hut, with lattice-doors in front, and a curtain to drop down before them, when they plea&s;e. <HI>[See the plate, Chine&s;e.]</HI></P>
<P>If a mandarine travels by water, they are furni&s;hed with barks, at the Emperor's expence. The&s;e are equal, in &s;ize, to a third-rate man of war, and beautiful in the ex|treme, being painted and gilt, and japanned within and without. Barks, mo&s;t in u&s;e, are about 16 feet broad, 24 long, and nine in depth, from the neck.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the ma&s;ter's cabin, who has his family with him, a kitchen, two large rooms, one before and the other behind, there is a hall, about &s;ix or &s;even feet high, and eleven broad; al&s;o, an anti-chamber, and two or three other rooms, for the mandarin; all on the &s;ame deck. The in&s;ide is japanned red and white, with plenty of carved work, paintings and gildings on the cieling and &s;ides. The tables and chairs are japanned, red and black. The deck is &s;urrounded with galleries, &s;o that the &s;ailors can pa&s;s and repa&s;s, without incommoding the pa&s;&s;engers. This apartment is covered with a platform, or terrace,
<PB N="55" REF="58">
open on all &s;ides, &s;et apart for mu&s;ic. Underneath is the hold, for the baggage, &s;ails, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The bark that carries the chief mandarin, is always followed by others, among which is one laden with pro|vi&s;ions: this carries the kitchen, the eatables, and the cooks: another is full of &s;oldiers; and a third, lighter than the re&s;t, is di&s;patched before, to clear the way, and pre|pare things where they are to &s;top. The&s;e barks have a certain number of rowers, relieved by others; at the di&s;tance of every league, are from five to ten centinels placed, &s;o that, if there is occa&s;ion, &s;ignals can be given from one to another, by fires, or pieces of artillery. The&s;e &s;oldiers &s;tand all of a row on the bank, as the mandarin pa&s;&s;es; one of them bears an en&s;ign di&s;played, the others are under arms.</P>
<P>Every time they ca&s;t anchor, as they do in the even|ing, or when they leave it in the morning, the <HI>corps de garde</HI> &s;alutes the mandarin with a di&s;charge of great guns, to which the trumpets reply with &s;everal flouri&s;hes. At night, lantherns are lighted at the head and &s;tern, and the ma&s;t is &s;trung with them. When the&s;e are lighted, the captain of the guard on &s;hore, &s;tands with his company oppo&s;ite the bark; and having &s;aluted the mandarin, retires leaving a centinel, who rattles a pair of bamboo ca&s;tinets all night, to declare he is &s;till on the watch. This cen|tinel is relieved hourly.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Their Way of Travelling.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;poken of their travelling by canals, it remains only to &s;peak of their roads, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The &s;ecurity of travellers, and an ea&s;y mode of con|veyance for pa&s;&s;engers and merchandi&s;e, are objects to which the Chine&s;e have paid particular attention; and, the manner in which the public roads are managed, greatly contribute to the former.</P>
<P>Like the Romans heretofore, they throw up highways, from one end of the kingdom to the other. Through the low grounds, they rai&s;e cau&s;e-ways to a great heighth, and, in &s;ome places, pave them; cut pa&s;&s;ages through rocks and mountains, to make the ways as level as po&s;|&s;ible, and &s;horten the di&s;tance. The high road cut out acro&s;s the mountains, to Si-ngan-fou, the capital of Chen-&s;i, is the mo&s;t remarkable thing in this country. The road was made by an army, in the cour&s;e of a mi|litary expedition. Mountains are levelled, and bridges con&s;tructed, reaching from one mountain to another; and, where the vallies are very wide, large pillars are erected, to &s;upport the&s;e bridges, which, in &s;ome places, are &s;o exceedingly high, that a traveller cannot look down from them without terror. They are wide enough
<PB N="57" REF="60">
for four hor&s;emen to ride a-brea&s;t, and are railed in on each &s;ide. Villages and inns, for the accommodation of pa&s;&s;engers, have been built, at certain di&s;tances, on the road.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of &s;ome mountains, which are perpendi|cular, and have no &s;helving, they have fixed large beams in them, and, on the&s;e beams, have made a &s;ort of bal|cony, without rails. Tho&s;e who are not u&s;ed to them, travel over them with great fear; but, the people of the place, pa&s;s them without concern.</P>
<P>The roads, in general, are very broad (25 or 26 yards), and, in all the &s;outhern provinces, paved; but, on the paved ways, no hor&s;e or carriage pa&s;&s;es. They are, for the mo&s;t part, bordered with very lofty trees; and &s;ome|times with walls, eight or ten feet high, to keep people out of the grounds. On all the great roads, covered &s;eats are erected, at proper intervals, where a traveller may &s;helter him&s;elf from the inclemency of the weather, and exce&s;&s;ive heat or cold. Temples and pagodas are al&s;o frequently to be met with, to which admittance is always granted in the day-time. Mandarins may continue in them as long as they plea&s;e; are there received with marks of di&s;tinction, &s;erved with attention, and are lodged, they and their whole retinue. Upon the road, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Bell,</HI> from the city of Siang-fou, are many turrets, called po&s;t-hou&s;es, erected at certain di&s;tances, with a flag-&s;taff on each, on which is hoi&s;ted the Imperial pendant.
<PB N="58" REF="61">
The&s;e places are guarded by &s;oldiers, who run from po&s;t to po&s;t, with letters that concern the Emperor, with great &s;peed. As the&s;e turrets are within &s;ight of each other, any intelligence may be &s;peedily conveyed. It is thus the court is quickly apprized of any di&s;turbance in the re|mote&s;t places. The&s;e turrets or towers, are &s;quare, brick buildings, about 12 feet high, on the tops of which are watch-boxes and centinels. On the roads that conduct to court (for they are general on all roads) they are provided with large ca&s;t-iron bells. The &s;tated di&s;tance by law, between tower and tower, is half a French league, &s;o that the roads are well guarded from robbers.</P>
<P>Every man who goes by armed, is obliged to give an account whence he came, where he is going, on what bu&s;ine&s;s, and mu&s;t &s;hew his pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Admini&s;tration have been at great pains to publi&s;h an itinerary of the whole Chine&s;e empire. This book, which is a directory for all travellers, takes in every road and canal, from the city of Peking to the remote&s;t ex|tremities of China.</P>
<P>Po&s;t-hou&s;es have been here e&s;tabli&s;hed, but they are not public; the couriers of the empire only have a right to u&s;e them, and officers di&s;patched by the court, who are always attended by a guard; but, excepting regular po&s;ts, travellers find no difficulty of getting their baggage tran&s;ported from one place to another. In every city
<PB N="59" REF="62">
there are a great number of porters a&s;&s;ociated under a common chief, who regulates their prices and all their agreements; he receives their pay, and is re&s;pon&s;ible for all they carry. When porters are wanted (and porters carry every thing) he furni&s;hes as many as are nece&s;&s;ary, gives the &s;ame number of tickets to the traveller, who returns one to each porter when he has delivered his load, and the porter, with this ticket, receives his pay of his chief, who has the money in advance.</P>
<P>This e&s;tabli&s;hment is &s;ettled by the general police of the empire. On all the great roads the traveller finds, in every city from which he is &s;etting out, &s;everal offices of this kind, who have a corre&s;pondence with the next he is to pa&s;s. Before his departure, he carries to one of the&s;e offices, a li&s;t of &s;uch things as he wi&s;hes to be conveyed, which is immediately entered in a book, and if he has occa&s;ion for two or three hundred, he is immediately fur|ni&s;hed. Every thing is weighed by their chief, and their price is five pence Engli&s;h for one day's carriage. An exact regi&s;ter is kept in the office. The traveller pays the money in advance, and on his arrival at the next office, he finds his baggage carefully delivered.</P>
<P>Every mile and a half, wooden buildings, like tri|umphal arches, about 30 feet high, with three doors, over which is wrote, upon a large frize, in characters &s;o large as may be read at a quarter of a mile di&s;tant, how
<PB N="60" REF="63">
far it is from the town you left, and how far to the town you are going to, &s;o that there is no need of guides.</P>
<P>It is the police al&s;o which regulates the cu&s;tom-hou&s;es, for every thing here is on the Emperor's account. Chi|ne&s;e cu&s;tom-hou&s;e-officers are perhaps the civile&s;t in the world. They have no concern but with merchants, whom they do not oppre&s;s by rigorous exactions. Tra|vellers are not &s;toped here, as in other countries, till their baggage is examined, though the officers are authori&s;ed &s;o to do, nor is the &s;malle&s;t &s;ee required.</P>
<P>As to the conveyance of letters, the royal po&s;t-ma&s;ter, for a little money, will favor the public, and carry letters from private per&s;ons, at as little expence, and with as much expedition as in Europe.</P>
<P>As it is a matter of importance that the Emperor's orders be quickly tran&s;mitted, &s;o is it great part of a mandarin's care to &s;ee that the roads be good; and the Emperor, who often travels about the country to keep the mandarins to this duty, &s;preading a report, that he means &s;hortly to vi&s;it this or that province; the gover|nors of tho&s;e provinces knowing this, &s;pare neither charge nor pains to repair the roads; as not only their fortunes, but &s;ometimes their lives are at &s;take upon the &s;tate of them.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64">A governor once hanged him&s;elf through de&s;pair, le&s;t he &s;hould not have time enough to repair the roads, through which he expected the Emperor to pa&s;s to the capital city. Yet the Emperor never went the journey. But all their care will not keep them in very good order; the &s;oil is &s;o light, and being much beaten by travellers, the &s;urface of them is ground &s;o fine, that they are blown away by bri&s;k winds, and the traveller is often obliged to wear a ma&s;k before his eyes; through clouds of du&s;t he is frequently compelled to make his way, and &s;wallow the &s;and in&s;tead of air: &s;o that in hot weather, and the wind in his face, &s;carce any but a native can with&s;tand it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of the Genius and Temper of the People.</HEAD>
<P>THE Chine&s;e have ever con&s;idered them&s;elves as &s;omething &s;uperior to the re&s;t of mankind, till the Europeans arrived among them, and to this day, though their ignorance is &s;o notorious in the &s;peculative &s;ciences, and even in &s;ome mechanical arts, as for in&s;tance, in clock-work, architecture, and &s;ome others, they will have it, that they have one eye more than us.</P>
<P>But exclu&s;ive of their own overweening opinion of them&s;elves, they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed generally of a great many
<PB N="62" REF="65">
good qualities, though they have &s;ome bad ones. They are a mild and affable people, polite even to exce&s;s; circum&s;pect in all their actions, weighing the con&s;e|quences of things before they attempt to carry them into execution: but more careful not to expo&s;e their prudence, than to pre&s;erve their reputation.</P>
<P>Politene&s;s is with them a principle of morality, and no &s;ort of men are excu&s;ed from it; trade&s;men, &s;ervants, even countrymen, nay, footmen, will take their leave of each other on their knees; and farmers in their enter|tainments, u&s;e more compliments than we do. Even &s;eamen, who, from their manner of living, and from the air they breathe, draw in a natural roughne&s;s, treat one another like brothers, and pay each other that deference, that one would think them united in the &s;tricte&s;t bonds of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Very much propo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an opinion of their own importance, they are not &s;en&s;ible of their defects; and, from entertaining too high ideas of their own knowledge, they &s;hut their eyes and run again&s;t in&s;tructions from others. Though &s;u&s;picious of &s;trangers, they are eager to take advantage of them, and notwith&s;tanding their boa&s;ted politene&s;s, and the equitable rules they pretend to be governed by; inju&s;tice is too often found in their courts, and much of the time, both of princes and people, taken up, as in Europe, with amorous intrigues; but they u&s;e &s;uch caution to conceal their vices, that a &s;tran|ger

<P>Though the Chine&s;e are &s;o jealous as not to &s;uffer their wives to &s;peak in private, even to their own brothers, much le&s;s indulge them with the enjoyment of that free|dom, and tho&s;e public amu&s;ements which, in Europe, is con&s;idered as gallantry and innocent plea&s;ure, yet there are hu&s;bands who will be &s;o complai&s;ant as to let their wives freely commit adultery: and which permi&s;&s;ion, &s;ome women make a condition in their marriage-articles. Tho&s;e who, according to &s;uch agreement, &s;ubmit to this practice (as there are a certain &s;ort of people that do), have no power to hinder debauchees from frequenting their hou&s;es, and from making an ill u&s;e of the ea&s;ine&s;s, or unruly pa&s;&s;ions of their wives. But &s;uch families are abhorred by the Chine&s;e, who think &s;o ill of them, that their children, though never &s;o de&s;erving or intelligent, can never obtain any degree, or be employed in any honourable office.</P>
<P>They continually apply them&s;elves to di&s;cover the in|clinations, humours, and tempers, of tho&s;e they have any commerce with, and keep up a fair corre&s;pondence, even with their greate&s;t enemies. When they have an intere&s;t to manage, no people know better how to in|&s;inuate them&s;elves into the good opinion of others, or improve an opportunity when it offers to greater advan|tage; nor will they decline the mo&s;t hazardous under|taking,

when they have any gain in view.

A fo|reigner is in great danger of being cheated, if he tru&s;ts to his own judgment; and if he employs a Chine&s;e factor, as is u&s;ual, both factor and merchant will combine to de|ceive him. If the Chine&s;e would accompany labour and natural indu&s;try, with a little more hone&s;ty, they would be complete merchants, but they &s;eldom fail to cheat whenever it is in their power, and fal&s;ify almo&s;t every thing they &s;ell. Hogs are &s;old alive by weight, and prior to their being weighed, they will make holes in their hide, beneath their bellies, and thru&s;t in flat pieces of lead to encrea&s;e their weight; and they counterfeit gam|mons of bacon &s;o artfully, that people are often taken in; and when they have boiled them a long time, &s;hall find nothing, when they &s;it down to eat, but a piece of wood under a hog's &s;kin.</P>
<P>Their &s;ubtlety in deception is &s;till more extraordinary in their thieves and robbers, who will break through the thicke&s;t walls, burn gates, and make great holes in them, by means of a certain engine, that fires the wood without any flame. Thus will they penetrate into the mo&s;t pri|vate rece&s;&s;es, and having with them a certain drug, the fume of which &s;tupefies the &s;en&s;es, and ca&s;ts per&s;ons into a

<P>But with all their di&s;hone&s;ty, there do not want in|&s;tances of fair-dealing, and open, generous u&s;age, with a fidelity not to be corrupted.</P>
<P>Among their ill qualities, they are naturally litigious; and in China, as well as in &s;ome other countries, a man may, if he plea&s;es, ruin him&s;elf by going to law. Great crimes are very uncommon among the Chine&s;e, but vices frequent; and the misfortune is this, the law neither &s;earches after, nor puni&s;hes them, but when they offend again&s;t and violate public decency.</P>
<P>A Chine&s;e is vindictive, but he &s;tudies to &s;eek re|venge, not by violent means, or by duelling, which is prohibited; but by craftine&s;s, or &s;tratagem, and con&s;e|quently, with impunity. Their revenge is &s;ecretly taken; and they will not only di&s;&s;emble their malice, but &s;eem pa|tient, even to in&s;en&s;ibility, till they have a favourable op|portunity to &s;trike home. For, however the Chine&s;e may excell in cunning, their courage is not very re|markable.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="69">But the Tartars, who, &s;ince their conque&s;t of China have mixed with the Chine&s;e, and are of a very different &s;tamp; though they adopted its cu&s;toms, they have &s;till retained their original character; are obligingly liberal, an enemy to every kind of di&s;&s;imulation, and more de&s;irous of enjoying their fortune than encrea&s;ing it. In all bu|&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate, a Tartar di&s;covers a penetration, that le&s;&s;ens the difficulty of what he undertakes; and, in af|fairs of &s;maller moment, he di&s;plays that expeditious ac|tivity, which may be ju&s;tly called, the &s;oul of bu&s;ine&s;s. In &s;hort, they are &s;uperior to the Chine&s;e, in almo&s;t every thing.</P>
<P>In giving this general character of the Chine&s;e, we have had an eye principally to the inhabitants of towns. In rural life, there is far more openne&s;s of temper, benevo|lence and friend&s;hip. A Chine&s;e pea&s;ant often di&s;covers moral qualities, which would add lu&s;tre to the character of more exalted rank. However, it mu&s;t, on the whole, he admitted, that China has produced great men of every kind, and taken from all cla&s;&s;es. Altogether, the people, as at pre&s;ent, are, to every other nation on earth, the mo&s;t curious monument that has been handed down to us, from the remote&s;t antiquity.</P>
<P>There is one virtue, however, peculiar to this coun|try, in its univer&s;ality and height to which it is carried, that mu&s;t not be omitted, when we are &s;peaking of their natural di&s;po&s;ition; I mean their piety to their parents:
<PB N="67" REF="70">
and it is a &s;ubject that mu&s;t give every rational reader &s;ome plea&s;ure to dwell on, and almo&s;t atones for every other defect. It is inconceivable to what a degree of perfection this fir&s;t principle of nature is here improved. There is no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, no point of obedience, which a parent cannot command, or which a child can refu&s;e. They have &s;uch a love, &s;uch an obedience, &s;uch a vene|ration for their parents, that neither the &s;everity of their treatment, the impertinence of old-age, or the meanne&s;s of their &s;ituation, even when their children have met with preferment, can ever efface.</P>
<P>Filial piety is &s;o much honoured and re&s;pected in Chi|na, that no in&s;tance is known of a legi&s;lator's having been under the nece&s;&s;ity of enforcing it by law. It is not only con&s;idered as a natural duty, but a point of religion; and a point that is ob&s;erved with the greate&s;t &s;trictne&s;s and attention. This duty &s;eems to be the main-&s;pring and principal cau&s;e of the exi&s;tence of Chine&s;e govern|ment, as the <HI>amor patriae,</HI> or love of one's country was the ba&s;is of the ancient republics; filial piety, in this em|pire is under&s;tood in a more exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, than it gene|rally is in Europe. It's chief object here, is that &s;ubjects &s;hould behave to their &s;overeign as children; and the &s;o|vereign protect his &s;ubject, as the common father of the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="71">They have a kind of written code, re&s;pecting the duty of a child, the precepts of which have acquired the force of laws. I will &s;elect &s;ome few pa&s;&s;ages from it.</P>

<P>The Emperor, on the death of his father, mourns three years, and never takes the helm of government in his hands, till the expiration of that time. Public bu&s;i|ne&s;s is conducted by a regency. The ob&s;ervance of this virtue is &s;trongly inculcated in all the public &s;chools, and is that part of education fir&s;t taught. The laws have al|&s;o regulated, with the greate&s;t preci&s;ion, the relative obli|gations between children and parents, hu&s;bands and wives, uncles and nephews, &amp;c. re&s;training on the one hand, by gentle cha&s;ti&s;ement, and encouraging on the other, by flat|tering rewards. The father has the merit of every good action, which the &s;on performs; and the Emperor grants, only to fathers, whether living or dead, tho&s;e marks of di&s;tinction which their &s;ons have merited.</P>

Their rea&s;on|ing upon this matter is as follows. Who is better ac|quainted with a &s;on's merits or demerits than his father, who has brought him up, and, for a long time, ob&s;erved all his actions? Can any per&s;on have a greater love, or a more &s;incere affection for him?

and the judgment re&s;erved for the Emperor him&s;elf, The magi&s;trates of the place are turned out of office, and all the neighbourhood threatened, as having given counte|nance to &s;o infernal a temper; as a man could never have arrived, they think, at &s;uch a degree of wretchedne&s;s at once; but mu&s;t have di&s;covered his di&s;po&s;ition on other occa&s;ions, which they &s;hould have taken care to correct. The criminal, in the&s;e ca&s;es, is &s;entenced to be cut into 10,000 pieces, and afterwards burnt; his hou&s;es and lands de&s;troyed, and even the hou&s;es that &s;tood near to his are era&s;ed, to remain as monuments of &s;o dete&s;table a crime.</P>
<P>Even the Emperors them&s;elves cannot reject the au|thority of their parents, without running the ri&s;k of &s;uf|fering for it. And their hi&s;tory relates a &s;tory which will always make the affection which the Chine&s;e have for this duty, appear amiable. One of their Emperors had a mother who carried on a private intrigue with a nobleman of his court, and the public notice that was taken of it, obliged him, both for her own honour, and that of the empire, to &s;hew his re&s;entment of it, &s;o that he bani&s;hed her into a far, di&s;tant province; and becau&s;e he knew that his conduct, in &s;o doing, would not be very acceptable to his princes and mandarins, he forbad them all, on pain of death, to give him any advice upon the &s;ubject. They were all &s;ilent for &s;ome time, hoping that he would, of him&s;elf, &s;ee his own error, and re-call her;
<PB N="72" REF="75">
but not doing it, rather than &s;uffer &s;o pernicious a prece|dent, they re&s;olved to interfere in it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t who had the courage to put up a reque&s;t to the Emperor in this affair, was in&s;tantly put to death on the &s;pot. This did not check the mandarins proceed|ings, for a day or two after, another made a &s;econd at|tempt, and to &s;hew the world that he was willing to &s;a|crifice his life for the public good, ordered his hear&s;e to &s;tand at the palace-gate. The Emperor, rather than af|fected at this noble action, was the more provoked: he not only &s;entenced this man to die, but, to terrify all others from following his example, ordered him to be put to the torture. One would not &s;urely have thought it prudent to hold out any longer; but the Chine&s;e were of another way of thinking, for they re&s;olved to fall one after another, rather than ba&s;ely pa&s;s over in &s;ilence &s;o bad an action.</P>
<P>A third, therefore, &s;tood forth and devoted him&s;elf, He, like the &s;econd, ordered his coffin to be &s;et at the palace-gate, and prote&s;ted to the Emperor, that he could not any longer &s;ee him per&s;i&s;t in his crime without re|mon&s;trating. <Q>What &s;hall we lo&s;e by our death, &s;ays he, but the &s;ight of a prince, on whom we cannot look without amazement and horror? Since <HI>you</HI> will not hear us, we will go and &s;eek out your ance&s;tors and tho&s;e of the <HI>Empre&s;s</HI> your mother, <HI>they</HI> will hear our complaints; and, perhaps in the darkne&s;s and &s;ilence
<PB N="73" REF="76">
of the night, you may hear our gho&s;ts and theirs, re|proach you for your inju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>The Emperor, more enraged than ever, at this in&s;o|lence, as he called it, of his &s;ubjects, inflicted on this la&s;t man, the &s;evere&s;t torments he could devi&s;e. Many others, encouraged by the&s;e examples, expo&s;ed them|&s;elves to torment, and did, in effect, die martyrs to filial duty. At la&s;t, this heroic con&s;tancy wearied out the Emperor's cruelty; and, whether he was afraid of more dangerous con&s;equences, or &s;tood &s;elf-condemned, as the father of his people, he repented of having put any of his children to death; and, as the &s;on of the Empre&s;s, was troubled that he had &s;o long mi&s;u&s;ed his mother. He, therefore, recalled her, re&s;tored her to her former dig|nities; and after this, the more he honoured her, the more was he him&s;elf honoured by his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Filial duty commences in families, and ri&s;es, &s;tep by &s;tep, to the &s;overeign, the common father, who &s;urpa&s;&s;es even the meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects, either in that kind of reverence which is due to ance&s;tors, or in his conduct to the Empre&s;s-mother, if &s;he &s;urvives her hu&s;band. No mother living, of whatever rank, is &s;o highly honoured, and &s;o publicly re&s;pected by a &s;on.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t day of every year, acknowledgments of duty and re&s;pect are renewed in every family, and al&s;o in the Emperor's. As &s;oon as the &s;un ri&s;es, all the manda|rins
<PB N="74" REF="77">
of the different tribunals repair to the palace, dre&s;&s;ed in their official robes; and the royal family and hou&s;hold, with di&s;tingui&s;hed badges, appear in their places. The Emperor, thus &s;ituated and accompanied, leaves his chamber to pay his re&s;pects to his mother, in an adjoin|ing apartment. He is carried there in his chair of &s;tate, but quits it at the entrance of his mother's ve&s;tibule, pre|ceded by a mandarin, the pre&s;ident of the tribunal of ceremonies, who, on entering her hall of audience, throws him&s;elf on his knees, and pre&s;ents a petition from the Emperor, reque&s;ting her Imperial maje&s;ty to receive on her throne, the humble marks of duty and affection which he is about to pay her. The mandarin-eunuch carries it to the Empre&s;s, in her inward apartment, and &s;he comes forth dre&s;&s;ed in a habit of ceremony, followed by her whole court, and a&s;cends her throne. The Em|peror and his &s;uite then approach, to the &s;ound of &s;oft and tender mu&s;ic, and a mandarin cries out, <HI>kneel.</HI> Im|mediately the Emperor, princes, and all the mandarins, fall on their knees; and, on the mandarin's crying out, <HI>pro&s;trate your&s;elves,</HI> throw them&s;elves on their faces. Af|ter nine pro&s;trations, all by word of command; the man|darin cries, <HI>ri&s;e up,</HI> and they all ri&s;e and &s;tand erect. This done, a petition is pre&s;ented to the Emperor, from his mother, reque&s;ting him to return to his own apart|ments. The mu&s;ic again plays, and the Emperor de|parts in the &s;ame manner he came. He is then followed in this ceremony, by the reigning Empre&s;s, and all the prince&s;&s;es and ladies of the imperial family, who pro&s;trate
<PB N="75" REF="78">
them&s;elves before the Empre&s;s-mother, as he has done. The Emperor, on his return to his own hall of audience, receives the compliments of the nobility.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this public ceremony on new-year's day, the Emperor is obliged to vi&s;it his mother every five days, all his life. And an Emperor newly proclaimed, cannot receive the homage of his grandees at court, till he has fir&s;t paid his re&s;pects to his mother. He never takes a wife without her con&s;ent, never be&s;tows any principalities on her children, or grants any favours to his people, with|out fir&s;t con&s;ulting her. In &s;hort it is held, that the filial piety of the prince, doubles all the virtues of his &s;ubjects; that all villainy begins by di&s;obedience to parents; that every virtue is in danger when filial piety is attacked; that to prai&s;e a &s;on is to boa&s;t; to blame a parent, is to throw a &s;tain upon one's &s;elf: and every thing which tends to promote filial piety, is a pillar to the &s;tate; and every thing that wounds it, a public calamity.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of their Marriages, Education, and Funerals.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Chine&s;e, in &s;ome particulars, bear an affinity with other nations, yet, in their man|ners and cu&s;toms, they differ from every known coun|try in Europe. If mutual con&s;ent is nece&s;&s;ary to con|&s;titute a marriage, there is no &s;uch thing as marriage in China. The parties never &s;ee each other till the bargain is concluded by the parents, and that is commonly when they are children; nor is the woman's con&s;ent even de|manded afterwards. Girls may well be reckoned part of their father's trea&s;ure, &s;ince the poore&s;t man mu&s;t purcha&s;e his wife, and no fortune is given with her.</P>
<P>When the Tartars, in the late war, took Nanking, there happened a circum&s;tance, which diverted the Chi|ne&s;e, notwith&s;tanding all their misfortunes. Among the di&s;orders which the victors committed in that province, they endeavoured to &s;eize on all the women they could, to make money of; and, when they took the chief city of that province, they carried all the women there, and &s;hut them up together in the magazines, with other goods. But, as there were &s;ome of all ages and degrees of beauty, they re&s;olved to put them into &s;acks, and carry them to market, and &s;o &s;ell them to any one at a venture, ugly or hand&s;ome. There was the &s;ame price &s;et upon
<PB N="77" REF="80">
every one; and, for 16 or 18 &s;hillings, take which you would, without opening it. After this manner the &s;ol|diers, who were ever in&s;olent in pro&s;perity, &s;hewed them|&s;elves more barbarous, in the mo&s;t polite city in the world, than they had been in the de&s;arts of Tartary.</P>
<P>On the day of &s;ale, there came buyers enough. Some came to recover, if haply they could, their wives or children, who were among the&s;e women; others were led there, through hopes that good luck would put a for|tune into their hands. In &s;hort, the novelty of the thing, brought a great concour&s;e from the adjacent places. An ordinary fellow, who had but 12s. in the world, gave it, cho&s;e a &s;ack, as did the re&s;t, and carried it off. When he was out of the crowd, whether through curio&s;ity, or a de&s;ire to relieve the per&s;on in the &s;ack, who complained, he could not forbear opening it. In it he found an old woman, whom age, grief, and ill-treatment, had de|formed to the highe&s;t degree. He was &s;o confoundedly mad at it, that, to gratify his pa&s;&s;ion and rage, he was going to throw the old woman and &s;ack, together, into the river; when the good old gentlewoman &s;aid to him, <Q>Son, your lot is not &s;o bad as you imagine; be of good cheer; you have made your fortune: take care only of my life, and I will make yours happier than ever it has been yet.</Q> The&s;e words &s;omewhat paci|fied him, and he carried her to a hou&s;e hard by, where &s;he made him acquainted with her quality, and her e&s;tate. She belonged to a mandarin of note in the
<PB N="78" REF="81">
neighbourhood, to whom &s;he immmediately wrote. He &s;ent her an equipage agreeable to her quality, and carried her deliverer along with her, and afterwards was &s;o good a friend to him, that he had never rea&s;on to complain of the lo&s;s of the two crowns he had laid out in the purcha&s;e of her.</P>
<P>The &s;ame matrons that negotiate a marriage, deter|mine the &s;um that is to be paid for the bride: and if &s;uch negotiators deceive the bridegroom in their accounts, re|&s;pecting the figure and per&s;onal qualities of the lady, he is at liberty to refu&s;e her, on lo&s;ing the purcha&s;e-mo|ney, or paying a &s;econd &s;um equal to it.</P>
<P>The calendar is always con&s;ulted for a lucky day to &s;o|lemnize the nuptials; and, in the intermediate time, let|ters pa&s;s between the young couple, pre&s;ents are &s;ent to and from the two families, and the bridegroom purcha&s;es &s;ome jewels for his bride; but the parties never &s;ee each other. On the day of marriage, the bride is locked in a clo&s;e &s;edan, or clo&s;e palanquin, which la&s;t is a kind of couch, covered with cu&s;hions and a te&s;ter, and car|ried by poles on men's &s;houlders: if, in a &s;edan, the key is commited to the care of a tru&s;ty dome&s;tic, who is to deliver it to the bridegroom, and &s;he is carried to his hou&s;e, preceded by a troop of mu&s;icians, with fifes, drums, and hautboys, and followed by her family. Every thing that compo&s;es her portion is borne before and behind her, by different per&s;ons of both &s;exes, whil&s;t

others &s;urround her, carrying lighted torches and flam|beaux. The bridegroom, richly dre&s;&s;ed, waits her ar|rival at his gate, the key is given him, and, as &s;oon as &s;he approaches, he eagerly opens the chair. If he is plea&s;ed with his bargain he receives her with great joy. If not, he &s;ometimes &s;uddenly &s;huts to the chair, and returns her to her parents. The poor woman has no alternative, whether &s;he likes her hu&s;band or not; if he likes her, &s;he mu&s;t continue with him; if not, mu&s;t go back: but if the bridegroom once receives her, the marriage is irre|vocable.</P>
<P>On quitting her chair, and entering the hou&s;e, &s;he is followed by both their relations, and the new-married couple &s;alute the god <HI>Tien</HI> in the hall, four times; and afterwards the parents of the bridegroom. The bride is then introduced to the women invited to the wedding, and, with them, partakes of an entertain|ment that ends only with the day. The men are alike entertained by the hu&s;band; for in all Chine&s;e fea&s;ts, men and women never eat and drink together, but the one &s;ex always apart from the other.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion and entertainments are always in pro|portion to the rank of the parties; &s;ome are attended with more pomp than others, but all make the be&s;t ap|pearance they can.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="83">A Chine&s;e can only have one lawful wife, and this wife mu&s;t be nearly of his own rank and age; but he may purcha&s;e as many concubines as he plea&s;es, and receive them into his hou&s;e, provided he enters into a contract to treat their daughters well. The&s;e concubines, or wives of &s;econd rank, are totally dependant on the lawful &s;pou&s;e, and are expected to be always obedient to her orders. Their children are con&s;idered as hers, and they addre&s;s her only as mother: indeed, &s;he is given to under&s;tand, that her hu&s;band hiring concubines, is merely to procure her a number of women to attend her, agreeable to the nations of antiquity, who e&s;tabli&s;hed this cu&s;tom in fa|vour of population. Some hu&s;bands, de&s;irous of male i&s;&s;ue, which perhaps they have not by their wives, will take a concubine from this motive only, and di&s;mi&s;s her when their wi&s;hes are accompli&s;hed, giving this concubine a permi&s;&s;ion to marry, and often procuring a hu&s;band for her them&s;elves.</P>
<P>When <HI>Le Compte</HI> ob&s;erved to them the jealou&s;y and unea&s;ine&s;s a plurality of wives mu&s;t needs occa&s;ion, they replied, there was nothing but what had &s;ome inconve|niencies attending it, and they did not know but a man might have more vexation with <HI>one</HI> than with <HI>many:</HI> where there are &s;everal, &s;ome of them might probably be in humour, when others were out of temper; but where a man is confined to one, there is no relief, if &s;he proves &s;ullen or noi&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="84">On the death of the lawful wife, the concubines and their children mourn for her three years, and the hu&s;band will then rai&s;e his favourite of the&s;e women, to the rank of lawful wife; on which occa&s;ions, age and rank is di&s;|pen&s;ed with, and all the ceremony I have before men|mentioned. The children of concubines have, however, a right to &s;hare with the children of the lawful wife, in their paternal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e concubines are almo&s;t all procured from the cities of <HI>Yang-tcheou</HI> and <HI>Sou-tcheou,</HI> where girls receive the fir&s;t of educations, and are taught &s;inging, dancing, mu&s;ic, and every other accompli&s;hment that can render them plea&s;ing and agreeable. Many are here purcha&s;ed to be again di&s;po&s;ed of. Indeed this is the chief trade car|ried on in the&s;e two cities. The law of China permitted no per&s;on to keep concubines but the Emperor, the princes of the blood, and the mandarins: the monarch being allowed two, and each of the others one; but cu&s;|tom has broken through this law. The Emperor has a &s;eraglio of more than 500, many of the nobles have nu|merous collections of women, and every other man, as many as he plea&s;es, or can afford.</P>
<P>As wives there are obtained only by purcha&s;e, men of the lower cla&s;s, and not in opulent circum&s;tances are forced to content them&s;elves with one; and in this re|&s;pect, the poor women in China have much the advan|tage of the rich. What would a lady give to exchange
<PB N="82" REF="85">
condition with a cottager, and have a whole man to her|&s;elf? For men of fortune will have a &s;eraglio of an hun|dred, if their circum&s;tances will admit of it, where the&s;e wretched creatures are perpetually confined, and &s;carcely allowed to breathe the fre&s;h air. They never &s;ee any other man than their keeper, or are &s;een by any; while poor women, the wives of cottagers, range about at liberty, and enjoy the u&s;e of their feet in a double &s;en&s;e, not being made cripples from their cradles, as their bet|ters have the honour to be, by bandages.</P>
<P>In all &s;eraglios, &s;he who is brought to bed fir&s;t, has the preference of the re&s;t, and, till a woman has had a child, &s;he is not &s;uffered to &s;it down at the table with the re&s;t of the family, but mu&s;t wait upon them. Next to being barren, the greate&s;t &s;candal is to bring females into the world; and if a woman happens to have three or four girls together, without a boy, &s;he will expo&s;e, or &s;trangle them with her own hands. And whenever the parents are poor and unfortunate, they con&s;ider it as an act of piety to remove an infant from a mi&s;erable ex|i&s;tence. This is the rea&s;on &s;o many children are expo&s;ed in the &s;treets and highways, who&s;e parents po&s;&s;ibly have &s;o much tenderne&s;s remaining, that, notwith&s;tanding a prevailing cu&s;tom, they cannot &s;ee them die, much le&s;s butcher them with their own hands.</P>
<P>A widower or a widow, may marry a &s;econd time, when neither age or rank are nece&s;&s;ary conditions; but a widow of rank, with children, being ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="83" REF="86">
of her&s;elf, &s;eldom marries again: tho&s;e of ordinary rank do; but tho&s;e of the poorer &s;ort are generally &s;old for the benefit of their hu&s;band's parents; and, as &s;oon as the bar|gain is concluded, a couple of cowlies or porters bring a chair, which is locked up, and guarded by a number of tru&s;ty people, and the widow is thus conducted to the hou&s;e of her new hu&s;band. Widows with child, and the mothers of a &s;on, tho&s;e whom their own friends will maintain, and who will become prie&s;te&s;&s;es, are exempt from this compul&s;ion.</P>
<P>Marriage is here held in &s;uch e&s;teem, that a poor man, who cannot afford to purcha&s;e a wife, will &s;ell him&s;elf for a &s;lave, on condition that he &s;hall be permitted to marry a female &s;lave in the family. Mo&s;t men marry by the time they are twenty years of age. An old batchelor is looked on with contempt, and the Chine&s;e in general, con&s;ider it as an unfortunate &s;ituation to leave no chil|dren to mourn over their graves. There is &s;carce a &s;in|gle man to be found in the country, and the women be|ing exceedingly prolific, it is no wonder the country is &s;o populous, e&s;pecially, as few of them travel out of it, and there is &s;eldom war or pe&s;tilence to take them off.</P>
<P>It may be matter of wonder, that in a country where every man marries, and the rich have many women, ten or a dozen each, how a &s;ufficient number of females are found for them, con&s;idering it is admitted that as many are born of the one &s;ex as the other. But when it is con|&s;idered
<PB N="84" REF="87">
that the poor, who make up the bulk of the na|tion, have but one wife each, and that as the men live &s;ingle till twenty, and the women are marriageable at twelve; all the females, between twelve and twenty, are &s;upernumeraries, and may &s;erve to fill the &s;eraglios of the great. They make it a rule never to marry one of the &s;ame name, but degrees of kindred are not much at|tended to, on the mother's &s;ide: two brothers, however, cannot marry two &s;i&s;ters, as with us, nor can the chil|dren of a widow and a widower marry together, nor a man any of his own relations, however di&s;tant; nor can young folks marry, whil&s;t in mourning for their parents, nor can the daughter of a free man marry her &s;lave.</P>
<P>As in all other ancient nations, divorces are granted in China, but with le&s;s facility: they are only admitted here in ca&s;es of adultery, mutual di&s;like, incompatibility of tempers and di&s;po&s;itions, indi&s;cretion, jealou&s;y, ab&s;olute di&s;obedience, barrenne&s;s, or hereditary and infectious di&s;|ea&s;es. No hu&s;band can repudiate a wife till a divorce is legally obtained. If a wife elopes from her hu&s;band, he can &s;ue out a proce&s;s, and obtain a &s;entence to &s;ell the fugitive, who then cea&s;es to be his wife and becomes his &s;lave. The law al&s;o protects wives de&s;erted by their hu&s;bands. If he ab&s;ents him&s;elf for three years, &s;he then lays her ca&s;e before a tribunal, and will be authori&s;ed to marry again; but &s;he would be puni&s;hed, if &s;he acted &s;o without the authority of a court.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="88">Per&s;ons of quality generally give their daughters two or three female &s;laves, when they marry, to attend her home to her hu&s;band,; and &s;o &s;acred is the wife's apart|ment, that even her hu&s;band's father is never permitted to enter it: and, if the father would puni&s;h the &s;on for any offence, as he is at liberty to do, even after marriage; &s;hould he get into his wife's apartment, he is as &s;afe as in a &s;anctuary.</P>
<P>Every father of a family is re&s;pon&s;ible for the conduct of his children and his &s;ervants; all tho&s;e faults being im|puted to him, which it was his duty to prevent. A law full of wi&s;dom, in a country where fathers and ma&s;ters exerci&s;e &s;o great an authority over their children and &s;laves.</P>
<P>No mother in China can make a will. Adoption of children is authori&s;ed by law, and the adopted child a&s;|&s;umes the father's name, and enjoys all the rights of a legal &s;on. Every father has a right to &s;ell his &s;on, if the &s;on has a right to &s;ell him&s;elf; as a &s;on in China is not allowed to have more power over his own per&s;on than his father has. But a father cannot &s;ell his &s;on to a comedian, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion is held contemptible. In &s;hort, a &s;on, during the life of his father, is always a minor: and a &s;on is liable to pay his father's debts, if not incurred by gaming.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="89">Fathers, fearful of not being able to provide for their &s;ons, will &s;ometimes make them eunuchs, and this ren|ders them capable of &s;erving in the &s;eraglios: they are called <HI>gelubden,</HI> and no other are &s;uffered to approach the women.</P>
<P>Slavery is authori&s;ed in China, but the ma&s;ter has no power to debauch the wife of a &s;lave; he would be puni&s;hed with death if he did. Though &s;laves are &s;o for life, it frequently happens that they gain their liberty; and &s;ome have the command of what they earn, and at liberty to earn it where they plea&s;e, on paying their ma&s;ters, annually, a certain &s;um. If &s;ome of them grow rich, by their indu&s;try, the ma&s;ter will not &s;trip them of their pro|perty, but, be &s;atisfied with large pre&s;ents. He will not, however, con&s;ent to their redemption at any price.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ters are anxious to promote marriage among their &s;laves, as children born in &s;lavery are the property of &s;uch ma&s;ters, and con&s;titute a fre&s;h tye, that attach their pa|rents to their &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Chine&s;e women, even of the greate&s;t rank, &s;eldom quit their apartments, which are generally &s;ituated in the mo&s;t retired part of the hou&s;e; and here they are &s;ecluded from all &s;ociety but their dome&s;tics, employ them&s;elves in painting and needle-work (but never meddle with trade) and have birds, dogs, and other animals to divert them. If daughters are not married in their father's life|time,
<PB N="87" REF="90">
brothers are obliged to &s;upport them. "A wife," &s;ays the book of ceremonies, "is not mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf; &s;he has nothing at her own di&s;po&s;al; &s;he can give no or|ders but in her own apartment, and here all her autho|rity is confined."</P>
<P>Every man has three names; a &s;ir-name, common to the family; a proper name, and a name he receives on entering any new employ; which is called his <HI>great-name.</HI> If he &s;hould enter any new &s;ect, the doctor who intro|duces him, be&s;tows a fourth name upon him. As for daughters, they retain their father's &s;ir-name only, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed according to the order of their birth, as fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, &amp;c. and do not change their names on marriage.</P>
<P>In the education of their children, they begin very early. The wealthy never appoint any woman to be a nur&s;e, that is not mode&s;t in her deportment and manner, that does not adhere &s;trictly to truth, that talks much, that has not a mild temper, and does not behave with affa|bility to her equals, and re&s;pect to her &s;uperiors. The manner of education of the Chine&s;e make &s;uch nur&s;es not uncommon.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as a child can put its hand to its mouth, it is weaned, and taught to u&s;e its right hand. At &s;ix years of age, if a boy, he is made acquainted with numbers, and the names of mo&s;t places in the world; at &s;even, &s;eparated
<PB N="88" REF="91">
from his &s;i&s;ters and taken out of the nur&s;ery; at eight, he is in&s;tructed in the rules of politene&s;s, and learns the calen|dar; at nine, &s;ent to &s;chool; at ten, to learn reading, writing, and accounts; from thirteen to fifteen, he is taught mu&s;ic, and all his &s;ongs are moral precepts; at fifteen they learn to ride and u&s;e the bow; at twenty they receive the cap of manhood, and are permitted to wear &s;ilk and fur; whereas, before this time, they could wear only cottons.</P>
<P>Europeans can &s;carcely conceive how far the &s;overeigns of China have carried their attention, in order to promote and encourage letters. In every city, in every town, and in almo&s;t every village, there are &s;chool-ma&s;ters, in order to teach the &s;ciences as far as they are able. Opulent pa|rents provide preceptors for their children, to teach them virtue, politene&s;s, hi&s;tory, and a knowledge of their laws. Many of the&s;e preceptors are, for their knowledge, after|wards ennobled; and a pupil is not a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee his preceptor become his viceroy.</P>
<P>When boys are brought forward in learning, they per|form public exerci&s;es, and have public examinations, in noble buildings erected for the purpo&s;e, where every thing is conducted without the lea&s;t force, as in our univer&s;ities, and tho&s;e that have made a &s;ufficient progre&s;s, have ho|norary rewards. The mandarins of letters will conde&s;cend to examine them, and the governors of cities will be&s;tow prizes on tho&s;e who be&s;t de&s;erve them.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="92">We &s;hall &s;ay very little of the education of girls: they are accu&s;tomed to mode&s;ty and &s;ilence, and to a ta&s;te for &s;olitude. If their parents are rich, they are taught every female accompli&s;hment. The duties, however, of wo|men in China, as in other A&s;iatic countries, are of the pa&s;&s;ive kind.</P>
<P>The funeral rites of the Chine&s;e are con&s;idered as the mo&s;t important of all their ceremonies, and per&s;ons re|ceive more honour and homage on the day of their deaths, than ever they did whil&s;t alive. Per&s;ons of any di&s;tinction, cau&s;e their coffins to be made in their life-time; and tho&s;e of the higher rank, cau&s;e their tombs to be built; each family, as with us, having a particular burying-place. Tho&s;e of the common people are in cemeteries, without the city, there being none allowed within the walls. The&s;e coffins are commonly varni&s;hed, and &s;ometimes carved and gilt; are made of durable wood, and upwards of &s;ix inches thick.</P>
<P>Rich people frequently lay out a thou&s;and crowns on a coffin of precious wood, inlaid and ornamented with dif|ferent colours. Tho&s;e who are not worth above twenty crowns, will often expend the greate&s;t part of it this way. In ca&s;es of poverty, and when all other means fail, a &s;on will often &s;ell him&s;elf, and become a &s;lave to purcha&s;e his father a coffin, which, perhaps, &s;hall remain 30 years u&s;ele&s;s in the family, but is con&s;idered by the head of it, as the mo&s;t valuable piece of furniture in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="93">When a man of fortune dies, his neare&s;t relation in|forms his friends of it: they a&s;&s;emble, wa&s;h and perfume the corp&s;e, and dre&s;s it in the be&s;t cloaths he u&s;ed to wear. Then placing the dead body in a chair, the wives fir&s;t, then the children, and afterwards the relations and friends of the decea&s;ed, pro&s;trate them&s;elves before the corps, and pa&s;&s;ionately bewail their lo&s;s. The third day the body is put into the coffin, laid on a layer of lime, laid over with cotton, covered with a piece of &s;ilk, and placed in the middle of the hall, hung with white linen, with &s;ome pieces of black or violet-colour inter&s;per&s;ed; having a table &s;et before it with a picture or effigy of the decea&s;ed upon it. The relations are then again introduced, and with wax-lights burning and incen&s;e, pay their homage to the coffin, and accompany their re&s;pects with lamenta|tions. In the mean time, all the &s;ons of the decea&s;ed, cloathed in linen and girt with a cord, &s;tand on one &s;ide of the coffin, in a mournful po&s;ture, whil&s;t the mother and daughters &s;tand on the other &s;ide, behind a curtain, lamenting in &s;uch &s;trains as cu&s;tom requires; the atten|dant gue&s;ts, all the time chanting mournful &s;ongs. Dur|ing the days that the corp&s;e is thus kept, there are tables well covered every morning, with &s;weetmeats and tea: the prie&s;t is the butler; the per&s;ons who come to pay their re&s;pects to the decea&s;ed, are u&s;hered in and out by a re|lation appointed for the purpo&s;e; a large &s;heet of paper is hung over the gate, expre&s;&s;ing the name and quality of the decea&s;ed, and giving a &s;hort detail of his life and great actions. The corp&s;e is &s;ometimes kept in this &s;tate for
<PB N="91" REF="94">
months, and all the &s;ons of the decea&s;ed &s;leep on mats or places round about his coffin. They ta&s;te neither fle&s;h nor &s;trong drink, nor come near their wives all this time. All the vi&s;its made to the decea&s;ed, are afterwards re|turned by the elde&s;t &s;on. The cu&s;tom is, not to be at home when he calls, and cards are left.</P>
<P>On the day of burial, the relations are again a&s;&s;embled, and mo&s;t of them attend and follow the corp&s;e to the grave; and the proce&s;&s;ion is as follows. A number of men, one before the other, march in file, carrying ima|ges of men and women, &s;laves, elephants, lions, and other animals, painted on pa&s;teboard, in order to be burnt at the grave. Next proceed figures of triumphal chariots, ca&s;tles, flags, and cen&s;ors filled with perfumes, &s;upported by men, two and two, followed by tables of &s;weetmeats, &amp;c. after which follow the prie&s;ts in their robes, with drums, mu&s;ic and bells, playing plaintive and melancholly airs. Immediately after the mu&s;ic, follows the coffin, carried by 20 or 30 men, under a canopy formed like a dome, compo&s;ed of violet-coloured &s;ilk; its four corners ornamented with tufts of white &s;ilk, neatly embroidered, and covered with network. Next walks the elde&s;t &s;on, cloathed in a canvas frock, with his body bent and leaning on a &s;taff: behind him his brother, two and two, leaning on crutches, as if not able to &s;upport them&s;elves, and the whole proce&s;&s;ion clo&s;ed, with the mothers and daughters, carried in clo&s;e chairs, covered with white &s;ilk or linen, and all the relations and friends of the decea&s;ed in mourn|ing,
<PB N="92" REF="95">
who, with the ladies &s;hut up, deafen the air with their continual howlings; to which are added, often, a number of women on foot, hired purpo&s;ely to howl.</P>
<P>At the burying-place, they find &s;everal temporary halls erected, and lined with tables covered with provi&s;ions, and &s;erved up with great &s;plendor, as a regale for the mourners and attendants. If the decea&s;ed is a grandee of the empire, his relations never leave the tomb for a month or two, but re&s;ide in apartments purpo&s;ely prepared for them, and renew their marks of homage daily. The&s;e funerals are more and more pompous in proportion to the rank and wealth of the decea&s;ed. In the proce&s;&s;ion of the Emperor's elder brother, there were more than 16000 people, all of whom had particular offices a&s;&s;igned them in the ceremony.</P>
<P>Mountains and &s;olitary places far from town, are cho|&s;en for the tombs and &s;epulchres of the great, &s;ome of which are very magnificent. If a tomb is erected in a valley or plain, a va&s;t heap of earth is rai&s;ed over it, as a <HI>tumulus,</HI> and covered with white pla&s;ter, &s;o that no wet can penetrate the tomb below, being an arched vault. In the vault, an altar is erected, lights placed on it, meats and incen&s;e offered on it, and the pictures of the men and animals burnt, which they conceive will be converted into the things they repre&s;ent, and will be of &s;ervice to the dead in another &s;tate. And if the decea&s;ed has held any con&s;iderable office, his virtues and illu&s;trious actions, real

or imaginary, are engraved on marble, and fixed up in the front of the tomb, with a number of figures, repre|&s;enting officers, eunuchs, &s;oldiers, &s;addled hor&s;es, camels, lions, and tortoi&s;es, ranged round in different rows; and groves of aged cypre&s;&s;es, planted chequerwi&s;e (which have never felt thre &s;troke of the axe), pre&s;erve an awful and melancholy gloom about them&mdash;An appearance more calculated to make a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the multitude, than the co&s;tly deccorations of our funeral monuments in Europe. The poor are contented with placing the coffin under a &s;hed, and covering it with a roof of thatch.</P>
<P>Some of the Chine&s;e have carried their filial attach|ment &s;o far, as to pre&s;erve in their hou&s;es, the bodies of their decea&s;ed fathers, for three or four years; and they have all, in general, &s;uch a veneration for the burying-places of their ance&s;tors, that neither curio&s;ity, nor the love of gain, can allure them to travel into remote parts of the world. They have a bad opinion of foreigners on this very account; and even de&s;pi&s;e their own country|men, who, from nece&s;&s;ity, or for the &s;ake of trade, go to Sunda or other i&s;lands, to re&s;ide; becau&s;e they ima|gine they mu&s;t leave their bones in unhallowed ground. It is little wonder, therefore, that the Chine&s;e are &s;o &s;el|dom to be met with in very di&s;tant nations.</P>
<P>Each family of di&s;tinction has a large building, called the hall of ance&s;tors, erected on &s;ome part of their e&s;tates, common for all the branches of the family, and de&s;tined
<PB N="94" REF="98">
for the following purpo&s;e. In this hall, a long table is &s;et again&s;t the wall, on which is painted, or the effigy fixed up of, one of their ance&s;tors, who has filled &s;ome office under government, with honour to him&s;elf, or ren|dered him&s;elf illu&s;trious by his talents. Sometimes it contains only the names of men, women, and children, belonging to the family, with their ages, day of their deaths, and dignities, in&s;cribed upon tablets, ranged in two rows, on &s;teps about a foot high.</P>
<P>In &s;pring, the relations a&s;&s;emble in this hall, the two wealthie&s;t of which prepare, at their own expence, an entertainment for the re&s;t. This entertainment, like the fea&s;ts at Tartar graves, were originally de&s;igned for the dead; for they never touch a bit of any thing till an of|fering has been made to them. But their annual fe&s;tivals at this hall, does not free the Chine&s;e from the obligation of vi&s;iting the real graves, or tombs of their ance&s;tors, once or twice a year. When they repair to the&s;e places, they begin by plucking up the weeds and bu&s;hes that &s;ur|round the &s;epulchre, and conclude by placing wine and provi&s;ions upon the tomb, which &s;erve to dine their a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The poor, who have no hall to honour the manes of their ance&s;tors, are &s;atisfied with placing up the names of their decea&s;ed relations in the mo&s;t open parts of their hou&s;es. If the Emperor happens to meet a funeral proce&s;&s;ion, when he goes abroad, he never fails to &s;end &s;ome of his attendants to condole with the relations of the decea&s;ed. Such are the marks of honour
<PB N="95" REF="99">
which the Chine&s;e pay their ance&s;tors; perhaps the &s;imple dictates of nature, &s;upported by cu&s;tom, but now e&s;tab|li&s;hed into a law, which cannot be broken with impunity.</P>

<P>THE commerce carried on within the country of China is &s;o great, that the trade of all Europe is not equal to it; the provinces are like &s;o many kingdoms trading with each other, &s;o that plenty reigns throughout the whole. One furni&s;hes rice, another &s;ilk, another imports ink, and curious works of all kinds; another iron, copper, and other metals, hor&s;es, mules, furs, &amp;. another &s;ugars, and the be&s;t teas; another plants, me|dicinal herbs, rhubarb, &amp;c. and &s;o of the re&s;t: for it would be endle&s;s to run through, minutely, the parti|cular riches of each province.</P>
<P>The great number of canals and rivers by which China is inter&s;ected, tend greatly to facilitate the conveyance of every kind of merchandize; and its prodigious population, occa&s;ions a rapid con&s;umption. A &s;ingle merchant &s;hall often tran&s;port, to one city, 6,000 caps, proper for the &s;ea&s;on; and they &s;hall all be &s;old, in three or four days. In a word, the mo&s;t frequented fairs of Europe, is but a faint picture of that immen&s;e number of buyers and &s;el|lers, with which the large cities of China are continually crowded.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="100">There are none but the poore&s;t families that cannot, with a little contrivance, find means to &s;ub&s;i&s;t very ea&s;ily by their trade; many, who&s;e whole &s;tock &s;hall not ex|ceed a crown, and yet the father and mother, with two or three children, are maintained by the little trade they carry on, get &s;ilk garments, and, in a few years, enlarge their commerce to &s;omething con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>This may be difficult to comprehend, and yet it happens daily. For in&s;tance, one of the&s;e &s;mall traders, po&s;&s;e&s;s|ing about 2s. &s;hall buy &s;ugar, meal and rice, and make &s;mall cakes, which he has baked, an hour or two before day, to warm, as they expre&s;s it, the heart of travellers; and his &s;hop &s;hall be &s;carcely opened, before his mer|chandize is carried off, by country people who crowd the cities every morning, by workmen, porters, and chil|dren of the di&s;trict. This little trade produces, in a few hours, 1s. 6d. more than the principal, the half of which is &s;ufficient to maintain the whole family; &s;o that, by thus &s;aving daily a little money, they are enabled to deal to a larger extent, and, at the end of a few years, it is not un|common to &s;ee a petty &s;hop converted into a ware-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Trade being &s;o exten&s;ive in all the interior parts of China, no wonder the inhabitants are &s;o little de&s;irous of foreign trade, e&s;pecially as they hold all foreigners in a very contemptible light. Indeed, they are not at all cal|culated for maritime commerce: &s;eldom do any of their
<PB N="97" REF="101">
&s;hips go beyond the &s;traits of Sunda, to Achen, Batavia, and Japan. At Japan, the articles which they barter, and which they fetch from Camboya and Siam, produce them <HI>cent. per cent.</HI> From China immediately to Japan, they export drugs, &s;ugar, hides, &s;ilks, &s;atins, &s;ilken &s;trings for in&s;truments, &s;andal wood, European cloth and cam|blets. In the&s;e la&s;t they have a quick &s;ale; but, as they are imported by the Dutch, the Chine&s;e never carry them, unle&s;s they can &s;ell them at the &s;ame price; and yet they affirm, they gain 50 <HI>per cent.</HI> which &s;hews what a profit the Dutch made by their trade. If one could depend on the hone&s;ty of a Chine&s;e, it would be ea&s;y for the Euro|peans to have commerce with Japan, by their means; but this is not to be done, unle&s;s we were to bear them com|pany; be ma&s;ters of the cargo, and had a &s;ufficient force to prevent in&s;ults. By &s;ugar they gain, &s;ometimes, 1000 <HI>per cent.;</HI> for &s;ilk, what co&s;ts in China but &s;ix taels, will &s;ell, at Japan, for fifteen.</P>
<P>The merchandize which Chine&s;e traders bring back from Japan, are fine pearls, by which they gain 1000 <HI>per cent.</HI> red copper in bars, which they buy for three or four tael, and &s;ell, in China, for ten or twelve; wrought copper &s;abre-blades, which produce 1000 <HI>per cent.;</HI> &s;mooth flowered paper, of which the Chine&s;e make fans; por|celain; japanned works, which are not equalled in any other part of the world, by which their profits are im|men&s;e; gold, which is very fine; and a metal called,
<PB N="98" REF="102">
<HI>Tombac,</HI> by which they gain 50 or 60 <HI>per cent.</HI> at Batavia.</P>
<P>Their trade with the Manillas is much le&s;s profitable, exporting a great deal of &s;ilk, &s;atins, embroidery, carpets, cu&s;hions, night-gowns, &s;ilk &s;tockings, tea, china-ware, and japanned work, by which they gain 50 <HI>per cent.:</HI> and bringing nothing back, but pieces of eight.</P>
<P>To Batavia their trade is more regular, ea&s;y and pro|fitable; exporting tea, china-ware, leaf-gold, and gold thread, tuta-neg, or <HI>Toutenack,</HI> a metal between tin and iron, which gains 150 <HI>per cent.</HI> drugs, and copper uten|&s;ils; and bringing back &s;ilver in pieces of eight, &s;pices, tortoi&s;e-&s;hell, of which the Chine&s;e make &s;undry toys, combs, boxes, cups, pipes, and &s;nuff-boxes, like tho&s;e in Europe, and which co&s;t but five pence; &s;andal wood, Brazil wood for dying, red and black wood; agate &s;tones, ready cut, which the Chine&s;e u&s;e as ornaments in dre&s;s; yellow amber, in lumps; and European cloths, by which they gain as much as when they &s;ell them at Japan.</P>
<P>Such is the greate&s;t trade that the Chine&s;e carry on, out of their own country. They go to Achen, in November and December, when the &s;hips of Bengal and Surat are on the coa&s;t; and &s;ometimes to Malacca, Cochin-China, &amp;c. but they &s;eldom import any thing from this country, but &s;pices, tho&s;e bird's-ne&s;ts I have de&s;cribed, e&s;teemed &s;o delicious a dainty, rice, camphire, rattan, which is a
<PB N="99" REF="103">
kind of long cane, and which they weave together like &s;mall &s;trings, and torches made of the leaves of certain trees, that burn like pitch.</P>
<P>Their commerce with the Ru&s;&s;ians, which is very con|&s;iderable, and carried on at Kiachta, the frontier-town between Chine&s;e and Ru&s;&s;ian Tartary, I have already largely dwelt on, when I &s;poke of that country, to which I mu&s;t refer my reader; it only remains to &s;peak of their trade with Europeans, by &s;ea.</P>
<P>The gains of the Engli&s;h in a voyage to China, ari&s;e from the goods brought back from thence, and not from what are carried thither. We buy the mo&s;t part of their goods with &s;ilver. Lead is almo&s;t the only commodity for which the India Company get more than prime co&s;t. We carry al&s;o &s;carlet, blue, black, green and yellow broad-cloth. But the remnants, or &s;mall pieces, which are bought up cheap in England, turn to better account than whole pieces. Of the&s;e &s;mall pieces, the Chine&s;e make long pur&s;es, which hang by their &s;ide, tied by &s;ilken &s;trings to their girdle.</P>
<P>The following articles turn al&s;o to pretty good account, if they can be &s;muggled a-&s;hore; otherwi&s;e, the charge and trouble will be equal to the profit. Large looking-gla&s;&s;es, coral-branches, flint-ware, ordinary hor&s;e-pi&s;tols with gilt barrels, old wearing-apparel of &s;carlet or blue cloth, &s;word-blades about 14s. a dozen, horn-&s;pectacles
<PB N="100" REF="104">
about 8s. 6d. per dozen, clocks and watches of &s;mall price, &s;mall bra&s;s tweezer-ca&s;es, and any new toy, not imported.</P>
<P>Goods brought back are, teas, china-ware, quick&s;ilver, vermilion and other fine colours, china-root, raw and wrought &s;ilks, copper in &s;mall bars the &s;ize of &s;ticks of &s;eal|ing-wax, camphire, &s;ugar-candy, fans, lacquered ware, &s;oy, borax, lapis-lazuli, galingal, rhubarb, coloured &s;tones, tuta-neg, gold, and mother-of-pearl toys. Though the exportation of gold is prohibited, the mandarins them&s;elves &s;ell it, in a concealed way. Ten tael weight of gold, touch 92, bought at touch for touch (the mo&s;t govern|ing price), amounts to 111 oz. 8 dwt. 5 grs. current &s;ilver, at 5s. 6d. per oz. value 30l. 12s. 8d. for which you have 12 oz. 2 dwt. 4 grs. of gold, worth 4l. an oz. in London, value 48l. 8s. 8d. yielding a profit of 58 <HI>per cent.</HI> But gold is a commodity not often bought there, but by tho&s;e who have more money to lay out than they have either room, or privilege in the &s;hip, which &s;eldom happens. There are a great many &s;orts of goods that, if got on &s;hore in London, without paying duty, and &s;old to proper hands, would make 5 or 600 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>A great deal depends on a per&s;on's knowledge of what things are likely to take in England, and at what price they are commonly &s;old. If a private trader would im|prove &s;uch a voyage to advantage, he &s;hould con&s;ult with
<PB N="101" REF="105">
the hard-ware, china, or toy-merchants, in London, and &s;hould carry with him mu&s;ters, or patterns, by which things may be made and painted, in China, for the Chi|ne&s;e workmen, of all profe&s;&s;ions, are &s;o ingenious, that they will imitate any thing that is &s;hewn to them, to the greate&s;t perfection and exactne&s;s.</P>

<P>Opium is an advantageous commodity, when carried to China; but mu&s;t be &s;muggled into the country, the importation being prohibited.</P>
<P>The porcelain, or china-ware, is &s;o various in quality and fa&s;hion, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to fix a price. Exqui|&s;itely fine enamel-work, in cups and ve&s;&s;els, is there made, and would bring more profit than either teas or por|celain, but are liable to be damaged in the voyage, and
<PB N="103" REF="107">
would take up much room, and, as the duty on the ex|portation of all metals, is as much as the prime co&s;t, &s;uch things mu&s;t be &s;muggled out of Canton. The prices, of late years, may be collected from the prices of China goods &s;old at Kiachta, which will be found in Pallas's Tour.</P>
<P>The India-Company trade is thus conducted at Canton. As &s;oon as the &s;hips come to an anchor at Wampoo, a couple of Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e boats, called <HI>Happo,</HI> are placed on each &s;ide of them, to &s;ee that nothing is &s;muggled in or out of the &s;hips: and all boats that go up to the fac|tory with goods, or pa&s;&s;engers, mu&s;t have a <HI>Chop,</HI> or permit, from a Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer. There are three cu&s;tom-hou&s;es by the river-&s;ide, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Emperor's yellow colours, on a long pole, before the door; at each of which, the&s;e boats mu&s;t call and be ex|amined.</P>
<P>When the &s;upercargoes have agreed with the Happo, or Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, with regard to the duty, and with the merchants about the prices of goods on board, and what kind of Chine&s;e goods are wanted to load with, the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e retinue come on board, mea&s;ure the &s;hip, and weigh and take an account of all the goods, which are im|mediately &s;ent to the factor's, or the merchant's hou&s;e who buys them, in a large &s;ampan. To prevent embezzle|ment, there are two or three of the &s;hip's company, well armed, &s;ent with the goods, and a Chine&s;e cu&s;tom-hou&s;e
<PB N="104" REF="108">
officer. After they arrive, and the &s;ampan is unloaded, the merchant weighs them over again, and the &s;uper|cargoes after them, in Engli&s;h &s;cales, for rea&s;ons which will be mentioned.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e merchants having agreed to provide &s;uch goods as are wanted, in particular quantities, at a fixed price, and to have all ready again&s;t a certain time; the &s;u|percargoes attend, view and ta&s;te the goods, and order every che&s;t to be packed, tarred, weighed and marked; after which, they are carried from the Chine&s;e merchant's warehou&s;e to the factory.</P>
<P>The&s;e warehou&s;es are commonly large, full of teas, &s;tanding in ba&s;kets, as they are brought from the field (only the coar&s;er teas are here m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nt); fine Hy&s;on is packed in che&s;ts, lined with &s;heet lead, to keep it from damps, which would entirely &s;poil it. Two hundred cow|lies, or porters, all naked to the middle, are often &s;een packing and treading the tea in che&s;ts. Two of them get into a che&s;t together, and tread it down as it is filled. If &s;ome nice Briti&s;h ladies were to &s;ee &s;ome of the&s;e fel|lows, with their na&s;ty feet and legs, perform this office, they would be apt to lo&s;e conceit of their beloved plant.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e warehou&s;es are generally very &s;pacious, and contain large quantities of porcelain, of all &s;izes and &s;orts, fit for the European market. The &s;upercargoes
<PB N="105" REF="109">
attend packing this al&s;o, for if a &s;trict eye is not kept on them, they will &s;ometimes put up china cracked, broken, or of inferior quality. They have even gone &s;o far as to fill up che&s;ts with &s;tones or bricks, in&s;tead of the fine&s;t commodities, which have not been di&s;covered till they have been opened in England.</P>
<P>If the che&s;ts are not immediately &s;ent to the factory, or to the &s;hip, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to leave a man or two to watch them, in the merchant's warehou&s;e; other|wi&s;e they may be &s;ubject to great abu&s;e; and there mu&s;t be a guard on them all the way to the &s;hips. It requires a great deal of patience and cunning to trade with the Chine&s;e. An even temper and a &s;mooth tongue, are qualifications ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for a &s;upercargo; for they mu&s;t be dealt with in the &s;ame crafty manner, that they deal with others.</P>
<P>Every thing is &s;old by weight in China; fle&s;h, fowls, fruits, rice, &amp;c. and even liquids; and to encrea&s;e the weight, they will cram their poultry with &s;tones and gra|vel. They will not &s;cruple exchanging a live hog for a dead one, if the latter is a little larger; and they like them as well when they die of a di&s;temper, as when killed by a butcher. For this purpo&s;e they will &s;ometimes give &s;uch hogs as the Engli&s;h purcha&s;e alive, a do&s;e to kill them &s;oon after they are brought on board; and when we are obliged to throw them away, will take them up and &s;ell them again to their own people.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="110">Every per&s;on dealing with the Chine&s;e, mu&s;t in&s;pect their goods, and be careful of their weights and mea&s;ures, if they would not be cheated. Their machines for weigh|ing are &s;o contrived, that they can ea&s;ily encrea&s;e or di|mini&s;h the weight, by imperceptibly altering the beam. The Engli&s;h, therefore, always u&s;e their own &s;cales. Tho&s;e al&s;o, who have confided on their package, have been no le&s;s deceived. They have found che&s;ts, boxes, tubs, and canni&s;ters, &s;o exactly imitated and marked, with damaged goods, or things of little value, and put in the place of fre&s;h goods; that the che&s;t has not been di&s;|covered, till brought, as I have before ob&s;erved, to England.</P>
<P>"I my&s;elf," &s;ays the author of this account, who was was frequently at China, <Q>once bought a piece of &s;tuff, for wai&s;tcoats and breeches, without looking over the whole of it, pre&s;uming it was all alike; and &s;ent it to the taylor, but was much &s;urpri&s;ed on his bringing them home, to find my wai&s;tcoat of different colours and different &s;ub&s;tances. A gentleman of my ac|quaintance, went into a gold&s;mith's &s;hop, to buy a gold head for his cane. The gold&s;mith having none of the pattern he wanted but &s;ilver-ones, told him, he would make him one: he did, but this head afterwards turned out to be a &s;ilve-rone gilt; and was probably one of tho&s;e he had &s;een in the &s;hop. When I have been in the &s;hops, I have had frequently my handkerchief, fan, or cane &s;tolen from me; and, on demanding them
<PB N="107" REF="111">
again, have only been laughed at: to have u&s;ed vio|lence, would have been only making a bad cau&s;e wor&s;e. I knew a poor &s;ailor, who pulled out his pur&s;e to count a few dollars, which he got from the pur&s;er at 40 <HI>per cent.</HI> in order to buy a little tea, &amp;c. for his homeward pa&s;&s;age, and a Chine&s;e ob&s;erving him, &s;natched the pur&s;e out of his hand, ran off and the &s;ailor after him; and though &s;everal Chine&s;e &s;aw the robbery, yet not one of them offered to &s;top the thief, but, on the contrary, laughed at the Engli&s;h|man's &s;implicity in attempting to recover it. At la&s;t, the Chine&s;e finding he was near overtaken, threw the pur&s;e from him, which the poor tar went and took up, but, to his great grief and mortification, found only one dollar left. Had he overtaken the thief, it is more than probable, the mob would have re&s;cued the villain, and &s;ent the poor &s;ailor home to the factory half dead with blows: for the mob are often &s;o in&s;olent to fo|reigners, as if their was neither law or government in the country; excepting when a mandarin pa&s;&s;es, and then they are all hu&s;h and &s;tand a&s;ide, with their eyes fixed on the ground.</Q></P>
<P>There is no one to complain to in &s;uch ca&s;es, but the Engli&s;h lingui&s;t, who always pretends, that he cannot find the aggre&s;&s;or; or, if he be found, that he denies the charge. <HI>Du Halde</HI> gives a &s;triking example of the di&s;ho|ne&s;ty and unconcern of a Chine&s;e merchant. The Cap|tain of an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, bargained with a Chine&s;e mer|chant
<PB N="108" REF="112">
at Canton, for &s;everal bales of &s;ilk, which the latter was to provide again&s;t a certain time. When they were ready, the captain went with his interpreter, to the hou&s;e of the Chine&s;e merchant, to examine whether they were &s;ound and in good condition. On opening the fir&s;t bale, all was right, but the re&s;t were damaged and good for no|thing. The captain, on this, fell in a pa&s;&s;ion, and re|proached the Chine&s;e merchant in the &s;evere&s;t terms, for his di&s;hone&s;ty. The Chine&s;e, after having heard him for &s;ome time, with great coolne&s;s, replied, <Q>Blame, Sir, your knave of an interpreter; he a&s;&s;ured me, that you would not in&s;pect the bales.</Q></P>
<P>The Chine&s;e have but two &s;orts of money, &s;ilver and copper; their &s;ilver pieces have no proper figure, but their value is regulated by their weight. The copper money is not above nine tenths of an inch in diameter, has a &s;quare hole in the middle, and is &s;tamped with two Chine&s;e words on the one &s;ide, and two Tartar words on the other: numbers of them are &s;trung like beads, and are counted by &s;trings, not by pieces. An ounce of &s;ilver is &s;ometimes equivalent to 1000 pieces of copper coin, and &s;ometimes only to 800. It is the intrin&s;ic value of the metal, that &s;tamps the value of the coin. Their &s;ilver money is ca&s;t in large and &s;mall plates, merely for the &s;ake of trade; and for want of &s;mall pieces, a Chine&s;e carries always about him, be&s;ides his &s;cales and weights, a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars, with which he cuts the &s;ilver money in pieces, and either gives or receives &s;uch pieces in buy|ing
<PB N="109" REF="113">
goods. When a Chine&s;e wants to cut a piece of &s;ilver, he puts it between his &s;ci&s;&s;ars and knocks them again&s;t a &s;tone, till the piece drops off.</P>
<P>The commerce of China is under the in&s;pection of the tribunal of finances; and the only commerce they con&s;i|der as of any advantage to them, is that which they keep up with Tartary and Ru&s;&s;ia; as it furni&s;hes them, by barter, with tho&s;e furs which are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;o much u&s;ed in all the northern provinces. The trade they carry on with the Engli&s;h and other Europeans at Can|ton, they con&s;ider as prejudicial to the Empire. "They take from us," &s;ay they, <Q>our &s;ilks, our teas, and our porcelain; the price of the&s;e articles is, con|&s;equently, rai&s;ed throughout the country: &s;uch a trade, therefore, cannot be advantageous. The mo|ney brought us by Europeans, and the high-priced baubles which accompany it, are mere &s;uperfluities to &s;uch a &s;tate as ours. We have no occa&s;ion for more bullion, than what is nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer the exigencies of government, and to &s;upply the relative wants of in|dividuals.</Q></P>
<P>Through the Royal canal, all barks from the &s;outh of China, bound to Peking, mu&s;t pa&s;s; and their number is &s;o con&s;iderable, and they tran&s;port &s;uch quantities of mer|chandi&s;e and provi&s;ions, that the duties collected on this canal alone, amount annually to 450,000<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="114">The porcelain manufactory employs more workmen, and contributes more to the good of commerce, than any other. As China abounds with potters earth, of various kinds, and of all colours, there is a great difference be|tween the porcelain of one province and that of another, both in &s;hape, &s;ize, and quality. In &s;ome places, va&s;es are made four or five feet in diameter, and three feet deep; in others, &s;ome are manufactured four or five feet high, with a proportionable circumference. The&s;e are u&s;ed by the rich, as ba&s;ons to hold gold-fi&s;h, flowers, aquatic plants, &amp;c.; and by the middling cla&s;s, as re&s;er|voirs for water, or for containing pul&s;e, &s;eeds, and fruits. They have al&s;o va&s;es made of a kind of earth that has the property of &s;weetening and cooling water; the&s;e are prefered to gold, chry&s;tal, or the fine&s;t porcelain, and are u&s;ed by the poor as well as rich.</P>
<P>The fine&s;t China is made in the village King-te-tching, in the province of Kiang-&s;i, in which are collected the be&s;t workmen. It is reckoned to contain above a million of inhabitants, who con&s;ume daily more than 10,000 loads of rice, and is as populous as the large&s;t city in China. It extends a league and a half along the banks of a beauti|ful river, and is not a collection of &s;traggling hou&s;es, in|termixed with gardens, or &s;pots of uncovered ground, but the people complain of its being too crowded, and that the &s;treets are too narrow; tho&s;e who pa&s;s through them, conceive them&s;elves tran&s;ported into the mid&s;t of a fair, where nothing is heard but porters calling out to
<PB N="111" REF="115">
make way. Provi&s;ions are here dear, being brought from very remote places, and even the wood for the fur|naces is brought from the di&s;tance of 100 leagues; but, notwith&s;tanding the high price of provi&s;ions, it is an a&s;y|lum for a great number of poor families, who could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t in any other place. Children and invalids find em|ployment here; and even the blind, by pounding of colours. The origin of the China-ware is not known; but this is known from their words, that in the year 442 of our era, the workmen of this village have always furni&s;hed the Emperor with porcelain, and that one or two manda|rins were &s;ent from court to in&s;pect their labours. The word porcelain is of European derivation, none of the &s;yllables which compo&s;e it, can be pronounced, or writ|ten by the Chine&s;e. <HI>Porcellana,</HI> in Portugue&s;e, implies a cup or di&s;h; but porcelain in China, is called <HI>T&s;&eacute;-ki.</HI></P>
<P>The fine porcelain is &s;o celebrated, that we cannot here omit giving &s;ome account of the manner of prepar|ing the pa&s;te. This &s;ub&s;tance is produced by the mix|ture of two &s;orts of earth, one purely white, and fine to the touch; and one intermixed with &s;mall, &s;hining parti|cles. The&s;e fir&s;t materials are carried to the manufacto|ries, in &s;hape of bricks. The white, fine earth, is the fragments of rock from certain quarries, reduced to pow|der, which is wa&s;hed and &s;cummed, and the fine &s;edi|ment only u&s;ed; which being formed into cakes by moulds, are &s;old by the hundred. Of the &s;hining earth, their are large mines; and it is from this the fine porce|lain
<PB N="112" REF="116">
derives all its &s;trength; for the white earth will ac|quire no firmne&s;s, without it. But of late years, the Chine&s;e have di&s;covered a &s;pecies of chalk, which, when mixed with the white earth, in&s;tead of the rock-&s;tone, gives it a much finer grain, but renders the China dearer, the one being three times more expen&s;ive in the procuring and preparing than the other.</P>
<P>To give a detail of the manner of making porcelain, would be only &s;welling this account unnece&s;&s;arily, China being made in England and other countries; I will only &s;hew that &s;everal cau&s;es concur in rendering the be&s;t china very dear in Europe. Be&s;ides the great profit to the importers, and that gained from them by the Chine&s;e factors; it &s;eldom happens that a burning or baking &s;uc|ceeds as it &s;hould. It &s;ometimes mi&s;carries entirely, and when the furnace is opened, the porcelain, together with the ca&s;es, are found melted into a &s;hapele&s;s ma&s;s, as hard as flint. The Chine&s;e have greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s in making different kinds of animals. They have the art of making ducks and tortoi&s;es that will float in water. <HI>Entrecolles</HI> &s;peaks of a porcelain cat, an excellent imitation of nature, in the head of which a lamp was fixed, the flame forming its two eyes, and the effect of this figure was &s;uch, that the rats in the night-time were afraid to approach it. The Chine&s;e &s;et &s;ome value upon Dre&s;den china, and &s;till more &s;o on the manufactures of Seve.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="117">The u&s;e of gla&s;s is very ancient in China, &s;o early as the beginning of the third century; and the remembrance of a gla&s;s jar pre&s;ented to the Emperor Tai-t&s;ou, who mounted the throne in 627, is &s;till pre&s;erved. This va&s;e or jar was &s;o large that a mule might have entered it with as much ea&s;e, as a gnat might have entered a pitcher, and it was nece&s;&s;ary in order to convey it to the palace, to &s;u&s;pend it in a net, the corners of which were fixed to four carriages.</P>
<P>China appears to have been the natural and original country of the &s;ilk-work, and the art of making &s;ilk from &s;ilk-worms, has been in that empire from the remote&s;t antiquity.</P>
<P>China indeed may be called a country of &s;ilk, for it ap|pears to be inexhau&s;tible, furni&s;hing &s;everal nations in Eu|rope and A&s;ia; and all the numerous inhabitants of China, except the princes, are clothed in dama&s;k and &s;atin; and they e&s;teem that &s;ilk to be be&s;t, which is fine, &s;oft, and white. They ever prefer the u&s;eful to the agreeable, and confine them&s;elves chiefly to the making of plain &s;ilks. If they were certain of a market, they would make as rich &s;ilks as any in Europe. They make cloth of gold, but do not make the gold into &s;mall wire, and cover thread with it, as in Europe; but gild a long &s;heet of paper, which they cut into &s;hreds, and cover threads of &s;ilk with it; of cour&s;e this does not la&s;t long, and &s;oon tarni&s;hes with the damp.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="118">A manufacture of &s;tockings, ribbands, and &s;ilk-but|tons, has been &s;ome time &s;et up at Canton, all which are made very good. The large&s;t buttons may be bought for ten pence a dozen, and &s;ilk &s;tockings for a tael.</P>
<P>The materials of Chine&s;e paper, and the way of pre|paring it, being different from tho&s;e of Europe, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give an account of this, among other curious manufactures of the country. Chine&s;e paper is of vari|ous kinds; &s;ome is made of the rind, or bark of the bamboo and cotton-tree; but, in fact, every province has its peculiar kind of paper: &s;ome is made of hemp, &s;ome of wheat or rice-&s;traw, &s;ome of the &s;kins found in the balls of &s;ilk-worms, &s;ome of &s;oft bamboo, and &s;ome of the mulberry-tree bark, of which it is the &s;econd coat, or &s;kin, white and &s;oft. Being fir&s;t beat in wa|ter to a pulp, it is made into &s;heets 10 or 12 feet long, and afterwards dipped in alum-water to glaze it, and an|&s;wer the purpo&s;e of &s;ize: even the wood of the bamboo and cotton-&s;hrub, may be, and is, converted into paper. The young branches &s;tripped of their outward bark, are cut into &s;lips and &s;uffered to lie in water till they rot, then boiled and beat into a pulp with, heavy hammers. After this it is mixed with an unctious juice extracted from a plant, till it is reduced to thick, clammy water, the &s;ur|face of which is taken up in moulds, as we do the pulp of linen rags, and forms paper. After which it under|goes a proce&s;s like &s;izing, to make it bear the ink.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="119">This account of their paper leads me to de&s;cribe their ink. The Chine&s;e, or Indian ink (as we call it) is not fluid like ours, but &s;olid like our mineral colours, though much lighter. It is made of lamp-black of &s;everal kinds, but the be&s;t is that obtained by hog's-grea&s;e, to which they mix a &s;ort of oil, to make it &s;moother, and &s;ome odorous ingredients to take off the rancid &s;mell. When mixed into a pa&s;te, it is formed in moulds into &s;mall &s;ticks as we receive it in England; but their printing ink, is a liquid made of lamp-black well beaten, &s;ifted through a &s;ieve and expo&s;ed to the &s;un, and afterwards tempered with <HI>aqua-vitae,</HI> till it is of the thickne&s;s of pa&s;te: after this it is thinned for u&s;e. They print only on one &s;ide of their paper; hence it is that every leaf of their books is folded, the fold being at the edge of the book, and the opening at the back, where they are &s;ewn together, &s;o that their books are cut at the back, whereas ours are cut at the edges. Their ordinary books are covered with pa&s;te-board, but the better &s;ort are bound in fine &s;atin or flowered taffety.</P>
<P>The art of printing, &s;o recent in Europe, has exi&s;ted in China from the remote&s;t antiquity; but it differs very much from ours. They do not print from types, but engrave the page on wood, &s;o as to be a <HI>fac &s;imile</HI> of the copy, imitating it exactly: and, to print from this en|graving, the printer u&s;es two bru&s;hes; one puts on the ink on the engraved wood, and the other, when the wood is covered with a &s;heet of paper, is drawn dry over it,
<PB N="116" REF="120">
and this makes it receive the impre&s;&s;ion. One man is able to throw off 10,000 copies in a day, and book&s;ellers in China, have no occa&s;ion to print more than they can vend.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e do not write with pens like Europeans, but with a rabbit-hair pencil, holding it perpendicular, and writing from top to bottom; but, like the Hebrews, from right to left, &s;o that the end of our book is the be|ginning of theirs.</P>
<P>They have a pretty method of &s;ilvering paper (if we may &s;o call it) at a &s;mall expence, and without u&s;ing any &s;ilver. In order to this, they take two &s;cruples of a &s;ize or glue made of leather, one of allum, and half a pint of clear water. The&s;e they &s;immer over a gentle fire, till the water is evaporated, that is, till no more &s;team ari&s;es, and, with a pencil &s;pread two or three layers of this glue over paper laid &s;mooth on a table. Then through a fine &s;ieve, &s;ift over the paper, a powder made of talc and allum, which, having been boiled in water, is dried in in the &s;un and pounded. This done, the &s;heets are hung up in the &s;hade to dry; and, when quite dry, are again laid on a table and rubbed gently with clean cotton, to take off the &s;uperfluous powder, which is u&s;ed again.</P>
<P>They di&s;til a &s;pirit called <HI>arrack</HI> from rice, in great quantities. Proclamations prohibiting this di&s;tillery, are often publi&s;hed, and officers are appointed to vi&s;it the &s;till-hou&s;es,
<PB N="117" REF="121">
and de&s;troy the furnaces; but if the owner &s;lips a few pieces of &s;ilver into his hand, the bu&s;ine&s;s is winked at. The mandarin &s;ometimes goes round him&s;elf, and the workmen if caught, are &s;eized and whipped; the ma&s;ters then conceal them&s;elves for a &s;hort time, change their habitations, and begin again: for, as the &s;ale of arrack is not prohibited, numbers of carts loaded with this liquor enter Peking daily. The duty is paid at the gate, and it is &s;old publickly in more than a thou&s;and &s;hops throughout the city and &s;uburbs.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit mentioning the pearl-fi&s;hery, and I cannot do it better than in this place. Pearls being fi&s;hed up in &s;ome of the rivers which empty into the Sagha-lien-oula, and the&s;e rivers being very &s;hallow, the divers plunge boldly to the bottom of the water, and having col|lected whatever oy&s;ters they can, as chance directs, re|turn to the bank with their load. This fi&s;hery belongs to the Emperor; but the greater part of the pearls are &s;mall, and not of a fine water. A much more beautiful kind is found in greater abundance in other rivers in Tartary, which flow into the ea&s;tern &s;ea.</P>
<P>The Emperor &s;ends every year to this fi&s;hery, a cer|tain number of men, cho&s;en from the eight Tartar bands. The fir&s;t three bands, which are mo&s;t celebrated and nu|merous, furni&s;h 33 companies; the other five furni&s;h 36. Each company has a captain and a &s;erjeant: three &s;u|perior officers command the whole, and a certain num|ber
<PB N="118" REF="122">
of merchants, well acquainted with the nature of pearls, accompany them. All the&s;e companies, for their permi&s;&s;ion to fi&s;h, mu&s;t every year give the Emperor 1140 pearls, pure and without blemi&s;h. When the&s;e fi&s;hers return, the pearls they bring are examined: if they are few in number, the officers are mulcted in their pay, or ca&s;hiered for negligence.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of their Government, Laws, Policy, and Revenue.</HEAD>
<P>THE Chine&s;e government is built on the ancient patriarchal. Whatever authority the patriarchs had over their families, the Emperor of China has over his &s;ubjects. No potentate on earth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o un|limited a power as the Sovereign of this numerous peo|ple. He is &s;tiled, <HI>Holy Son of Heaven; Sole Governor of the Earth; Great Father of his People,</HI> &amp;c. He is the undi&s;puted ma&s;ter of the lives of his &s;ub|jects; though he &s;eldom exerts this prerogative but to promote their happine&s;s. No &s;entence of death pro|nounced by any of the tribunals, no verdict in civil ca&s;es, no determination of any moment, can be enforced, till it has been confirmed by him. On the other hand, whatever &s;entence he pa&s;&s;es is immediately executed. All edicts from the throne are as much re&s;pected as if they proceeded from a divinity. He has the di&s;po&s;al of
<PB N="119" REF="123">
all offices of &s;tate, and the appointment of vice-roys and governors. No employment is here purcha&s;ed; merit, for the mo&s;t part, rai&s;ing to place; and place exalting to rank. Family is no recommendation, and even titles are not hereditary; but in the family of <HI>Confucius,</HI> their an|cient law-giver. The Emperor has a right of nominating two &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, whether from his own family, or from any of his &s;ubjects; and as he can ennoble, &s;o can he de|grade. A plebeian to-day, may be a nobleman to-mor|row; and a nobleman one day, may rank with a plebeian the next.</P>
<P>There are only two ranks of men in China, <HI>viz.</HI> the nobility and the people. The fir&s;t is compo&s;ed of man|darins of letters and of war, and the&s;e enjoy every valua|able privilege; in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, may remon&s;trate with the Emperor, either individually, or in a body; and their remon&s;trances are never ill received. But the Emperor acts as he plea&s;es notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The <HI>literati</HI> are highly honoured in China; but go|vernment checks their pride and encourages their labours. To attain the eminence of a mandarin of letters, a man mu&s;t be fir&s;t batchelor; &s;econdly, licentiate; and la&s;tly, doctor. When &s;everal places become vacant, the Em|peror invites to court, a like number of the <HI>literati,</HI> who&s;e names are in&s;erted in a li&s;t, and the&s;e choo&s;e the vacant governments by lot.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="124">There are eight orders of mandarins of letters. In the fir&s;t are mini&s;ters of &s;tate, pre&s;idents of &s;upreme tribunals, and all the &s;uperior officers of the militia. The chief of this li&s;t is pre&s;ident of the Emperor's councils, and great confidence is repo&s;ed in him. The &s;econd men are the vice-roys and pre&s;idents of the &s;upreme councils of the different provinces. Of the third order are the &s;ecreta|ries to the Emperor. The fourth order, if not governors, are to repair the harbours, royal lodging-hou&s;es, and the barks. The fifth order, has the in&s;pection of the troops; the &s;ixth, the care of the highways; the &s;eventh, the &s;uperintendance of rivers; and the eighth, that for &s;ea-coa&s;ts. The&s;e are all mandarins of letters, and to them is intru&s;ted the admini&s;tration of the Chine&s;e Empire. From among them are cho&s;en the governors of provinces; of cities of the fir&s;t, &s;econd and third cla&s;s; and the pre|&s;idents and members of all the tribunals. Honours are lavi&s;hed on them, and every privilege and mark of di&s;|tinction re&s;erved for them alone. The homage paid by the people to every mandarin in office, is almo&s;t equal to that of the Emperor him&s;elf. They amount in number to more than 41000, and yet the veneration the people entertain for them is always the &s;ame.</P>
<P>When any mandarin quits his office, if he has acted in it to the &s;atisfaction of the people, they load him with &s;uch marks of honour as would engage the mo&s;t &s;tupid to be in love with virtue and ju&s;tice. When he is taking his leave, in order to relinqui&s;h his office, almo&s;t all the
<PB N="121" REF="125">
inhabitants go into the highways, to entertain him, and place them&s;elves, &s;ome here, &s;ome there, for almo&s;t 14 or 15 miles together; &s;o that every where in the road are &s;een tables hand&s;omely painted, with &s;atin table-cloths, covered with &s;weetmeats, tea, and other liquors.</P>
<P>Every one almo&s;t con&s;trains him to &s;tay, to &s;it down and eat or drink &s;omething. He no &s;ooner leaves one than another &s;tops him, and thus he &s;tands the whole day amid&s;t the applau&s;es and acclamations of his people. And what is more, every one de&s;ires to have &s;omething belonging to him. Some take his boots, others his cap, others his great-coat; giving him, at the &s;ame time, another of the &s;ame &s;ort; and before he is quit of this multitude, it &s;ometimes happens he has changed his boots thirty times. The&s;e boots, which perhaps have only been on and off, are con&s;idered as valuable ornaments. Tho&s;e which are fir&s;t taken off, are &s;u&s;pended in a cage, over the gate by which he quitted the city: the re&s;t are pre&s;erved by his friends, with the &s;ame care as a French warrior would pre&s;erve the &s;word of a <HI>Turenne</HI> or a <HI>Bayard.</HI></P>
<P>Public honours are di&s;pen&s;ed with a more &s;paring hand, on the mandarins of arms. The&s;e never have the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare in the public admini&s;tration, not even the in&s;pection of the troops. But, to be a mandarin of arms, a man mu&s;t pa&s;s through gradations of military &s;cience, &s;uch as batchelor, licentiate, and doctor of arms. The&s;e
<PB N="122" REF="126">
hold tribunals, the members of which are &s;elected from among their chiefs. Among the&s;e they reckon princes, dukes, and counts. All the&s;e dignities, or others equi|valent, are found in China. The pre&s;ident of this tribu|nal is one of the great lords of the empire, who&s;e autho|rity extends over all the army, and corre&s;ponds with our commander in chief. This pre&s;ident has, for his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or or a&s;&s;i&s;tant, a mandarin of letters, who is the &s;uperinten|dant of arms.</P>
<P>The chief of the mandarins of arms, is a general by birth, and has a certain number of mandarins who act as lieutenant-generals, colonels, captains, lieutenants, and en&s;igns under him. The number of mandarins of arms are between 18 and 20,000.</P>
<P>There are &s;ix tribunals e&s;tabli&s;hed at Peking, and the pre&s;idents of the&s;e are the Emperor's grand council, which con&s;i&s;ts of all the mini&s;ters of &s;tate, and the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the &s;ix &s;overeign courts or tribunals, of which I am go|ing to &s;peak.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t tribunal watches over the conduct of the &s;everal provinces, keeps a journal of their good and bad tran&s;actions, reports them to the Emperor, who puni&s;hes or rewards them according to its report, and is a kind of civil inqui&s;ition. The &s;econd has the &s;uperintendance of the finances of the &s;tate, as the coins, money; collects the duties, directs the public magazines, and keeps an exact
<PB N="123" REF="127">
regi&s;ter of all the families that compo&s;e this va&s;t empire. The third is that of ceremonies, regulates them and en|forces their ob&s;ervance, repairs all temples, arranges the annual &s;acrifices, receives and entertains amba&s;&s;adors, has the in&s;pection of arts and &s;ciences, and pre&s;erves tranquili|ty among the different religious &s;ects here tolerated. The fourth is the tribunal of arms, has the war-department and controul of the army, and is compo&s;ed of mandarins of letters only. The fifth is the criminal bench. And the &s;ixth has the care and charge of all the public works, palaces, buildings, tombs, monuments, bridges, &s;treets, rivers, highways, barks, and every thing relating to in|land and foreign navigation.</P>
<P>The members which compo&s;e the&s;e different tribunals, are half Chine&s;e and half Tartars; and one of the two pre&s;idents of each tribunal is always a Tartar born. Each tribunal has al&s;o &s;everal &s;ubordinate ones, among whom the offices in its department are divided. The&s;e &s;uperior tribunals are none of them ab&s;olute, but are checked by the interference of others: and, le&s;t a combination of the whole &s;hould act contrary to the intere&s;t of the Sovereign, a cen&s;or is appointed over each, who watches their con|duct, revi&s;es their acts, and reports to the Emperor. The&s;e men hold their offices for life, and therefore are emboldened to &s;peak out, when they &s;ee rea&s;on for it. Their accu&s;ation &s;ets an enquiry on foot, and the accu&s;ed is di&s;charged from his office, were he even one of the fir&s;t men in the empire. An example of this kind was once made
<PB N="124" REF="128">
of three mandarins, who were found to have taken money clande&s;tinely for &s;ome &s;ervices done by them in the exe|cution of their office. The Emperor not only degraded them from their office, but ordered them to retire into the cla&s;s of common men; and one of them, who had been a great while a magi&s;trate, and was much e&s;teemed for his under&s;tanding, and re&s;pected for his age, was con|demned to attend one of the palace-gates with other com|mon &s;oldiers, among whom he was inli&s;ted; but when on duty as a centinel, the people would bow to him, &s;till re|&s;pecting him on the &s;lender remains of that honour, he ju&s;t before po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The cen&s;ors of the&s;e &s;ix tribunals, form al&s;o, a tribu|nal of them&s;elves, which has the in&s;pection of the whole empire, placed, as it were, between the throne and the mandarins. The Sovereign is ma&s;ter of their lives; but many of them, having a power to remon&s;trate to the crown, have patiently &s;uffered death, rather than betray the cau&s;e of truth, or wink at abu&s;es; as we have &s;een in the in&s;tance of the Emperor bani&s;hing his mother.</P>
<P>Over this tribunal, there is a &s;upreme one, that of princes, no where known but in China, compo&s;ed of of princes only. Some of the ordinary mandarins belong to it, as &s;ubaltern officers, to draw ca&s;es and prepare writings, but this is all. All the children of the Imperial family, are entered among them as &s;oon as born, and to the&s;e are al&s;o con&s;igned the dignities and titles which the
<PB N="125" REF="129">
Emperor confers on them. This tribunal is the only court where they can be tried; and, in ca&s;es of accu|&s;ation, it ab&s;olves or puni&s;hes them, according to its plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>An extract from Chine&s;e hi&s;tory, relates a circum&s;tance which happened, in a late war, with one of the kings of Tartary. The Emperor &s;ent a mighty army, under his brother's command, to puni&s;h the vanity and ra&s;hne&s;s of that puny king who had dared to make inroads on the Emperor's allies. The Tartar, who&s;e warlike troops waited only for an opportunity of &s;ignalizing them&s;elves, advanced to the Imperial army, attacked them, and routed them, notwith&s;tanding he was far inferior in number.</P>
<P>The Emperor's father-in-law, an old Tartar, well ver&s;ed in the trade of war, commanded the artillery, and played his part &s;o well, that he was killed at the head of a few, yet brave, &s;oldiers, whom he encouraged, as well by his example as his words; but the general was accu&s;ed of flying fir&s;t, and drawing, by his flight, the re&s;t of the army after him. The Emperor, who was him&s;elf a man of courage, being le&s;s troubled at the lo&s;s of a battle, than he was at that of his brother's honour, &s;ent for him to court, and tried him before a council of the blood-royal and the princes. The royal general, who was, on all other accounts, a man of &s;ingular merit, &s;urrendered him&s;elf with the &s;ame humility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, as any inferior

<P>There is a tribunal inferior to all the re&s;t, called, the Tribunal of Hi&s;tory; compo&s;ed of the greate&s;t geniu&s;&s;es of the empire, and men of the mo&s;t profound erudition. To them is entru&s;ted the education of the heir-apparent to the throne; and the compilation and arranging the general hi&s;tory of the nation. From this body are gene|rally cho&s;en the mandarins of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, and the pre|&s;idents of the &s;upreme tribunals. This is a court formi|dable even to the Emperor him&s;elf, it being proof again&s;t &s;eduction; for, was the Sovereign to attempt it, it would be con&s;igned to hi&s;tory, in &s;pite of all his efforts to &s;up|pre&s;s it.</P>
<P>It is the duty of each of the&s;e per&s;ons who compo&s;e this tribunal, by him&s;elf, and without communication with the
<PB N="127" REF="131">
re&s;t, as things fall out, to &s;et them down on a loo&s;e piece of paper, and put the&s;e papers, through a chink, into an office, &s;et apart for this purpo&s;e. In the&s;e papers, both the Emperor's virtues and faults, are con&s;tantly recorded, with the &s;ame liberty and impartiality. "Such a day," &s;ay they, <Q>the prince's behaviour was un&s;ea&s;onable and intemperate; he &s;poke in a manner unbecoming his dignity. The puni&s;hment he inflicted on &s;uch an of|ficer, was rather the effect of pa&s;&s;ion, than the re&s;ult of ju&s;tice. In &s;uch an affair, he &s;topped the &s;word of ju&s;tice, and partially abrogated the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed by the magi&s;trates.</Q> Or el&s;e, <Q>He entered wi&s;ely into a war, for the defence of his people, and the honour of his empire. At &s;uch a time he made an honourable peace. He gave &s;uch and &s;uch marks of love to his people,</Q> and &s;o on. And, that neither fear on one &s;ide, nor hope on the other, may bias the&s;e men to par|tiality, this office is never opened during that prince's life, or whil&s;t any of his family &s;it on the throne. When the crown goes into another line, which often happens, all the&s;e loo&s;e memoirs are gathered up, and after being com|pared, to come at the certain knowledge of the truth, they, from them, compo&s;e the hi&s;tory of that Emperor, to propo&s;e him as an example to po&s;terity, if he acted wi&s;e|ly; or to expo&s;e him to the common odium of the peo|ple, if he has acted otherwi&s;e. When, therefore, a prince, who loves honour and glory, and hopes hereafter, to live in the dutiful memory of his &s;ubjects, and &s;ees that it is not in the power of flattery and impo&s;ture to per&s;wade the
<PB N="128" REF="132">
people to give it to him, he will be circum&s;pect and cau|tious how he behaves him&s;elf, during his whole reign.</P>
<P>No fees are paid for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; &s;o that every poor man can pro&s;ecute his own rights, and is freed from being oppre&s;&s;ed by the opulence of his adver|&s;ary; and there being no barri&s;ters in China, a bad cau&s;e is never glo&s;&s;ed over, nor the judge's mind perverted by fallacious and &s;ophi&s;tical rea&s;oning. The goodne&s;s of a cau&s;e is its be&s;t advocate; and, if &s;entence is given again&s;t a man in one court, he can appeal to a higher; and the definitive &s;entence is always given by the Emperor.</P>
<P>With them, as I have ob&s;erved, nobility is never he|reditary; nor is there any di&s;tinction of rank, except what office gives; &s;o that, independent of the family of <HI>Con|fucius,</HI> who are looked upon with reverence, who is con|&s;idered as the legi&s;lator, and of whom I &s;hall &s;peak here|after, the whole kingdom is divided into magi&s;tracy and commonalty. There are no lands but what are held by &s;occage-tenure; not even temple-lands, or tho&s;e de&s;tined for the prie&s;ts: &s;o that their gods, as well as men, are &s;ubject to the &s;tate; and, by taxes and contributions, ob|liged to acknowledge the Emperor's &s;upremacy. When a viceroy, or governor, dies, his children, as well as tho&s;e of other men, have their fortunes to make; and, if they inherit not their father's virtue and ingenuity, his name, which they bear, be it ever &s;o renowned, will en|title
<PB N="129" REF="133">
them to no rank or precedence. By this &s;tate-maxim, trade ri&s;es in e&s;timation, and the Emperor's re|venues increa&s;e, as no e&s;tates are tax-free, and family-influence never gains &s;uch an a&s;cendancy, as to inconve|nience the prince; and it is, la&s;tly, a received opinion among the Chine&s;e, that if an Emperor would be obliged, he &s;hould lay his commands on his <HI>&s;ubjects,</HI> and not on little <HI>kings.</HI></P>
<P>All mandarins are obliged, every three years, to give in an exact account, in writing, of the faults they have committed in the di&s;charge of their office. This kind of confe&s;&s;ion is examined at court, and the Emperor makes private enquiry into the truth of them, and whether &s;uch mandarins have done their duty; if they have, they are rewarded, if not, they are tried, di&s;graced, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and puni&s;hed. And every three years, the viceroy, or go|vernor of each province, makes his report to the Emperor of the conduct of the mandarins in his di&s;trict. The principal mandarins are &s;ometimes broke, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from all employments; at other times, are only removed a few degrees lower, and appointed to &s;ome inferior office. And, a &s;ingular regulation, which exi&s;ts only in China, is, that every mandarin degraded to an inferior office, is, in the execution of that office, obliged, at the head of all the warrants, or precepts, he i&s;&s;ues, to men|tion the number of &s;teps he has lo&s;t. Thus, for example, he will &s;ay&mdash;<Q>I, &s;uch a mandarin, degraded three, four, or &s;ix &s;teps (according as the ca&s;e may be), order and
<PB N="130" REF="134">
command, &amp;c</Q> And the in&s;pector of a province, has an unlimited authority over &s;uch mandarins, and can, by his own power, deprive them of their employment, never con&s;ulting the court, but in ca&s;es where immediate pu|ni&s;hment is not nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>And, that the mandarins may be more in the Em|peror's power, the offices about court, are given to the &s;ons of mandarins; by which means, the&s;e &s;ons remain as ho&s;tages for their father's good conduct.</P>
<P>The Emperors of the Chine&s;e have &s;eldom appeared in public; but the pre&s;ent Tartar-family &s;hew them&s;elves to the people, about four times a month. When he vi&s;its the frontiers of Tartary, as he does almo&s;t every year, 30 or 40 Tartar princes attend, to do him homage; but he vi&s;its the provinces, riding po&s;t, with only a few of his officers, guards being planted along the roads, for his &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>An unbounded authority which the laws give the Em|peror, and a nece&s;&s;ity which the &s;ame laws lay on him to u&s;e that authority with moderation and di&s;cretion, are the two props which have, for 4000 years, &s;upported this great fabric of the Chine&s;e monarchy. He never pre&s;umes to enact a law, but with the concurrence of the great coun|cil; or ever &s;u&s;pend, or alter one, but with their appro|bation. But he is &s;o ab&s;olute, that the grave it&s;elf cannot put an end to his power over his &s;ubjects; for, when he
<PB N="131" REF="135">
has a mind to di&s;grace, or honour families, he will confer titles, or infamy, even on the dead.</P>
<P>The women are excluded from having any &s;hare in their government or councils; and, by way of deri&s;ion, having learned that women are &s;ometimes ve&s;ted with &s;overeign power in this part of the world, they call Europe, <Q>The Ladies Empire.</Q></P>
<P>Their civil laws are almo&s;t all taken from their canon|ical books of morality, and filial piety is their ba&s;is. Ju|ri&s;prudence is taught in China, in the &s;ame manner as the principles, rules and my&s;teries of religion, are in other countries; all their laws being maxims of civil and &s;ocial duty. Many of them I have already &s;et forth, under their manners and cu&s;toms. But no laws can be more &s;evere than their penal laws; and the&s;e laws are &s;o combined, that no fault e&s;capes puni&s;hment, and the correction never exceeds the crime committed. Every per&s;on accu&s;ed is examined by five tribunals; each examines the proce&s;s, and their enquiries are directed not only again&s;t the ac|cu&s;ed, but the pro&s;ecutor, and his witne&s;&s;es. The cul|prit remains, 'tis true, in pri&s;on, during all this &s;low pro|ce&s;s; but pri&s;ons here are not dungeons, they are &s;pacious and convenient. It is the duty of a mandarin to in&s;pect them frequently, to &s;ee the pri&s;oners properly treated, to &s;end for phy&s;icians when they need it, he being re&s;pon|&s;ible for the &s;ick. If any man dies in pri&s;on, the Emperor is informed of it, and another mandarin is di&s;patched to
<PB N="132" REF="136">
examine into circum&s;tances, and &s;ee if the in&s;pecting man|darin has done his duty.</P>
<P>Pri&s;ons, in great cities, are &s;o large, that they con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal &s;treets, with market-places, walks, gardens, canals, &amp;c. like the palaces. In Canton alone, 'tis &s;aid, there are not le&s;s than 15,000 pri&s;oners. The offenders are allowed to work, in the day-time, for their living, the Emperor's allowance being but &s;mall; and the Chi|ne&s;e not being very charitably di&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;lighte&s;t of all their puni&s;hments is the <HI>ba&s;tinado.</HI> It is a mere paternal correction, which has no infamy an|nexed to it. The Emperor even orders it on &s;ome of his courtiers, but they are as re&s;pectable as before; and a mandarin, without ordering, will, if he meets any one abroad de&s;erving of it, inflict it immediately, his officers of ju&s;tice being always with him. The number of blows is in proportion to the crime, but never le&s;s than 20. The infliction is with a cudgel on the breech, by throwing the offender on the ground. The offender afterwards, if he is able, falls down to the mandarin, and thanks him for his kind correction; though one blow is enough to lame him, if the officer is not bribed.</P>
<P>The baton, or <HI>Pan-t&s;&eacute;e,</HI> a piece of bamboo, a little flatted, is an in&s;trument of puni&s;hment which every man|darin may u&s;e at plea&s;ure, either when any one forgets to &s;alute him, or when he admini&s;ters public ju&s;tice. On
<PB N="133" REF="137">
the&s;e occa&s;ions, he &s;its gravely behind a table, on which is placed a bag of &s;mall &s;ticks; his officers furni&s;hed with &s;ome of the&s;e Pan-t&s;&eacute;es, and waiting only his &s;ignal, to u&s;e them. When he means to puni&s;h any one, he takes one of the&s;e &s;mall &s;ticks from the bag, and throws it into the hall of audience; the culprit is then &s;eized, laid down on the ground, his breeches pulled down to his heels, and a &s;trong dome&s;tic gives him five blows of his Pan-t&s;&eacute;e, and another &s;ucceeds, and gives him five more, if the mandarin draws another &s;tick from the bag; and &s;o on, as long as the mandarin thinks proper. After this, the criminal is to throw him&s;elf on his knees, and thank his judge, for the attention he has been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on him.</P>
<P>The puni&s;hment of the wooden collar is al&s;o u&s;ed in China. This is compo&s;ed of two pieces of wood, like the yoke by which men carry pails, which, put together, inclo&s;e the head, and fit the &s;houlders. They are &s;o large, that the criminal can neither &s;ee his feet, nor put his hand to his mouth; &s;o that he cannot eat, without being fed. It generally weighs from 50 to 60 lb. weight, though &s;ome weigh 200lb. for greater offences; and the offender is obliged to carry this about with him, day and night. The time for a robbery, di&s;turbing the peace of a family, or being a notorious gambler, is three months. He is not at liberty to take &s;helter in his own hou&s;e, but &s;tationed, for a certain time, in &s;ome public &s;quare, at the gate of a city, or at the tribunal where he was condemned.
<PB N="134" REF="138">
When the term of his puni&s;hment is expired, he is brought before the mandarin, receives an admonition from him, and is di&s;charged, after having received 20 &s;ound blows.</P>
<P>Other crimes, le&s;s than homicide, are puni&s;hed by ba|ni&s;hment for life, to tug the royal barks for three years, or be branded in the cheeks.</P>
<P>Theft from relations is more &s;everely puni&s;hed than theft from &s;trangers. Whoever informs again&s;t his pa|rents, grand-father or grand-mother, uncle, or elde&s;t bro|ther, is condemned to receive 100 blows of the Pan-t&s;&eacute;e, and be bani&s;hed for three years, though the accu&s;ation may be ju&s;t; and, if fal&s;e, the accu&s;er is &s;trangled. All ince&s;t is puni&s;hable, according to the offence. A grand|&s;on, deficient in duty to his parents, grand-father or grand-mother, receives 100 blows of the Pan-t&s;&eacute;e; if he gives them abu&s;ive language, he is &s;trangled; if he lifts his hand again&s;t them, he is beheaded; and, if he wounds, or maims them, his fle&s;h is torn from his bones with red-hot pincers, and he is cut into 10,000 pieces. If a younger brother abu&s;es his elder, he receives 100 blows of the Pan-t&s;&eacute;e; and, if he dares to &s;trike him, he is bani&s;hed.</P>
<P>Homicide is puni&s;hed with death. The man who kills another, even in an accidental quarrel, is &s;trangled with|out remi&s;&s;ion; a rope of about &s;ix or &s;even feet long, with a
<PB N="135" REF="139">
running noo&s;e, is thrown over the criminal's head, a cou|ple of dome&s;tics belonging to the tribunal pull it &s;trongly, in different directions, then, on a &s;udden quit it. A few moments after, they give it a &s;econd pull, which ge|nerally does the bu&s;ine&s;s; and a third is &s;eldom ne|ne&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The cutting in 10,000 pieces, is a kind of puni&s;hment never known but in China, and too horrid to be related. This torture is al&s;o too &s;evere for a feeling mind to bear any de&s;cription of, of cour&s;e, I tru&s;t my readers will excu&s;e it. But to &s;often their &s;everity, the&s;e cruel inflictions are never exerci&s;ed but in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on, and other extra-of|fences; and no &s;entence of death is put into execution, till it has been approved and confirmed by the Emperor, after a careful examination into the whole of the trial: nor does he &s;ign the death-warrant, till he has prepared him&s;elf, by fa&s;ting.</P>
<P><HI>Le Comte</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that it is a common thing for men to let them&s;elves out to be ba&s;tinadoed, in the room of the criminal; and the near relation of an accu&s;ed per|&s;on, acknowledged to be guilty, is permitted to put him|&s;elf in his place, and &s;uffer the infliction of the law for his friend, if the puni&s;hment be a light one. A Chine&s;e condemned to bani&s;hment, may take his family with him; and the relations of all per&s;ons accu&s;ed, are encou|raged to admini&s;ter to their wants and comforts in pri&s;on. And &s;uch is their national humanity, that the ability of a
<PB N="136" REF="140">
judge, who has been able to detect a criminal among all his &s;ubterfuges to elude ju&s;tice, is le&s;s e&s;teemed than one who&s;e penetration has &s;aved an innocent man, when con|&s;piracy and malevolence have combined to ruin him.</P>
<P>The Emperor him&s;elf is treated little le&s;s than a divi|nity. If he is dangerou&s;ly ill, the palace is full of manda|rins of every order, who &s;pend night and day in a large court, in habits proper for the occa&s;ion, to expre&s;s their own grief, and a&s;k of Heaven their prince's cure. Rain, &s;now, cold, or any other inconvenience, never excu&s;e them from this duty; and, as long as the Emperor is in pain, or in danger, any one that &s;aw the people, would think, that they feared nothing but the lo&s;s of him.</P>
<P>Though the prince can nominate his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, he never changes the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but &s;uffers the Crown to be here|ditary, unle&s;s the next heir has forfeited his claim, by the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome crime. Such princes of the blood as have merit to recommend them, are always titled, and protected; but, &s;uch as are un-titled, are &s;ubject to the &s;ame police as every other citizen; and, if they commit a crime, and are tried before any tribunal, are treated with the utmo&s;t rigour, and no &s;um of money, however great, can exempt them from puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>No kind of &s;ervice, rendered to the &s;tate, is either for|gotten, or goes unrewarded; and nothing is neglected, in China, that has any relation to government, Even the
<PB N="137" REF="141">
Gazette, printed daily at Peking, and circulated through|out the empire, is made &s;ub&s;ervient to the con&s;titution. The writers of the&s;e papers never dare to in&s;ult the na|tion with the abilities or &s;ucce&s;s of a buffoon, with the de&s;cription of a new dance, or with the graces and figure of a comedian; but, in this Gazette, may be &s;een, the names of tho&s;e mandarins who are deprived of their offi|ces, the cau&s;e of their di&s;grace, and the names of tho&s;e who&s;e merit has rai&s;ed them to a po&s;t of eminence. It takes the earlie&s;t opportunity of publi&s;hing the name of the mo&s;t ob&s;cure &s;oldier, who has di&s;played courage and intrepidity in battle; announces to the whole empire, an act of filial piety, or an example of female mode&s;ty, even in the humble&s;t ru&s;tic; mentions the crimes of all tho&s;e delinquents puni&s;hed with death; acquaints the peo|ple with every &s;tep government takes; and contains, even the remon&s;trances, which &s;uperior tribunals take the liberty of pre&s;enting to the Sovereign. Nothing, how|ever, is in&s;erted till the Emperor has &s;een it; death would be the con&s;equence to the authors, or the printer, if it was.</P>
<P>The Emperor's revenue amounts to above 41 millions &s;terling, and he might ea&s;ily encrea&s;e it by new impo&s;i|tions, but &s;eldom exerci&s;es this privilege, for he can levy what taxes he plea&s;es, for the exigencies of government. The common tax is about a tenth part of the profits of all profe&s;&s;ions, which is &s;eldom exceeded; and the Em|peror, every year, exempts &s;ome one or more of the
<PB N="138" REF="142">
provinces from paying any, e&s;pecially if they have been vi&s;ited by any epidemic &s;ickne&s;s, unfavourable weather, or any other calamity.</P>
<P>An account of every man's family, e&s;tate, and &s;ub|&s;tance, with the taxes due to the crown, is taken every year and enrolled; a copy of which is hung up at the door of every man's hou&s;e, and the ma&s;ter is obliged to carry in the Emperor's duties to the mandarins, without being called on, on pain of impri&s;onment and the ba&s;ti|nado till done; &s;o that all the charges of collectors and receivers is &s;aved, and the mandarins pay in theirs to the trea&s;ury of the province, who tran&s;mits the &s;urplus to Peking, after he has paid the governors, officers, and &s;oldiers of the province, and other nece&s;&s;ary charges of government are defrayed.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the taxes are paid in kind, and the officers of government, are all furni&s;hed with every ne|ce&s;&s;ary both for food and cloathing, &s;o that the commodi|ties paid in taxes, are almo&s;t all con&s;umed in tho&s;e pro|vinces in which they are levied; what remains is &s;old for the Emperor. Tho&s;e taxes paid in money, ari&s;e from the cu&s;toms and the &s;ale of &s;alt, which belongs &s;olely to the Emperor, and other imports; the trader &s;carcely con|tributes any thing&punc; all &s;eems to fall upon the hu&s;band|man.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="143">The annual expences of government are immen&s;e, but they are &s;o regulated, that great &s;avings are yearly made, and the&s;e &s;avings &s;upport a war, or defray other contin|gent expences.

<P>Their money having been &s;poken of, I have only to ob&s;erve; they keep up a balance in the value of copper, of which their &s;mall coin is made; never &s;uffering it to be &s;o low in value, as to tempt men to coin; nor &s;o high in value, as to induce them to convert the coin to other purpo&s;es.</P>

<P>HAVING treated of their navy, when giving an ac|count of their rivers and ports, I &s;hall here only &s;peak of their army.</P>
<P>The conduct and bu&s;ine&s;s is, as I have already no|ticed, under the controul of the mandarins of letters; but the field-officers are all mandarins of arms, the pre&s;ident of who&s;e tribunal is commander-in-chief. It is computed that there are between 18 or 20,000 mandarins of war. The troops of the empire amount to more than 800,000, and yet they are maintained with five millions &s;terling; whereas, only 100,000 of Engli&s;h foot, co&s;t our govern|ment two millions, rating the maintenance of a &s;oldier at fifteen pounds per year; yet no army is better cloathed than the Chine&s;e, better paid, or better armed. This numerous army reminds us of tho&s;e of Xerxes and Darius; but if we con&s;ider the extent of the empire and its great population, it is not &s;o extraordinary.</P>
<P>The pay of a Chine&s;e or Tartar-&s;oldier is about two-pence-halfpenny and a mea&s;ure of rice per day; that of a hor&s;eman is double the pay of a foot-&s;oldier. The Em|peror furni&s;hes a hor&s;e, and the trooper receives two mea|&s;ures

of &s;mall beans daily. Arrears are paid up every three months.</P>
<P>The Emperor frequently reviews his army, at which time, he is &s;eated upon a carpet &s;pread for him in the field, and attended, on the right, by the commander in chief, and by his chief mandarins on the left <HI>[See the plate],</HI> where the officers of the guards, after the evolu|tions are gone through, are pre&s;ented to him; the guards at a di&s;tance on their bended knee. At every review their arms are carefully in&s;pected. Tho&s;e of a hor&s;eman, con&s;i&s;t of a helmet, a cuira&s;s, a lance, and a large &s;abre. Foot-&s;oldiers are armed with a pike and &s;abre; &s;ome of them with fuzees, others with bows and arrows. If any of the&s;e are found in bad condition, or in any re&s;pect ru&s;ted, the neglect is immediately puni&s;hed: if the of|fender is a Chine&s;e, by 30 or 40 blows with a &s;tick; if a Tartar, with as many la&s;hes.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e-guards of Peking, are above 160,000, di|vided into eight battallions, each of which has a banner, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the colours, <HI>viz.</HI> yellow, white, red and blue; or by the border, <HI>viz.</HI> yellow, with a red border, white with ditto, red with a white border, and blue with a red border. Green is the colour of the Chine&s;e banner. Each batallion has a general, and under him, &s;everal lieu|tenant-generals. Each batallion has 100 companies, well officered, and the men are pretty well di&s;ciplined. They are rather tumultuous in their march, but want neither &s;kill nor ability in performing their different evolutions.

The hor&s;e form them&s;elves into &s;quadrons, make an at|tack, engage and rally, without the lea&s;t difficulty, by the &s;ound of a trumpet or a horn. They ride with &s;hort &s;tirrups, their knees up to the &s;addle, which enables them to ri&s;e on their &s;tirrups and give a heavier blow; indeed, all per&s;ons in China, ride in this manner. The Chine&s;e &s;oldiers, in general, handle a &s;abre well, and they &s;hew much dexterity in &s;hooting with bows and arrows; but notwith&s;tanding this, they are ea&s;ily routed; owing to an effeminate education that boys receive, and the little u&s;e they have to make u&s;e of their weapons. To &s;ee them reviewed, one would think them &s;ufficient to awe all A&s;ia, but the we&s;tern Tartars think nothing of their numbers, and frequently &s;ay, in deri&s;ion, that the neigh|ing of a Tartar hor&s;e, is enough to rout all the Chine&s;e cavalry: yet they take all po&s;&s;ible care to have good &s;ol|diers, for they take no officers into the guards, till they have made trial of their &s;toutne&s;s, dexterity and &s;kill, in military knowledge.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers look very &s;mart, are neatly dre&s;&s;ed in blue Nanking &s;tuff, their gowns &s;hort and narrow, with ratan caps on their heads, and a bunch of red hair fixed on the top of them; which, when they perform any quick motion, or are agitated by the wind, make a grand ap|pearance, e&s;pecially when four or five hundred of them are marching in a body. Their boots are of &s;ilk lined with cotton. Their principal arms are the &s;word and bow; the former is very large, heavy, and broad; they
<PB N="143" REF="148">
wear them on the left &s;ide, but with the handle behind, and the point hanging down forward. When they draw them, they, with the left hand, take hold of the lower end of the &s;cabbard, and lift up the &s;word behind them &s;o high, that the handle may reach above the &s;houlder behind; &s;o that, at the drawing the &s;word, with the right hand over the left &s;houlder, they can give a quick and a heavy &s;troke; and, aukward as this may appear to tho&s;e who are unu&s;ed to it, it is certain they do it with great ca&s;e and agility; the effect of con&s;tant practice.</P>
<P>Their bows are very large and &s;trong, and are carried in a ca&s;e on the left &s;ide, with a quiver of arrows on their back. On the right thumb, they wear a broad and thick ivory or agate ring, on which they place the &s;tring of the bow when they draw it, and have another ring on the left thumb, for the arrow to run upon, when they &s;hoot.</P>
<P>The officers, in &s;un-&s;hine, make a &s;plendid appear|ance, their dre&s;s being embroidered with gold and &s;ilver on the back and brea&s;t, where their badges of di&s;tinction are fixed, and which make a glittering &s;hew. They all wear whi&s;kers, as do the common men, and have a fierce look. The common Tartar-&s;oldiers, though brought from the north, have tawny complexions, and their fierce countenances &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h them from the natives of China, who are more effeminate and &s;oft-featured.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="149">There is a large plain below Canton, where the cavalry quartered in that city, are frequently exerci&s;ed, and is a kind of large hor&s;e-cour&s;e, with po&s;ts fixed at &s;mall di&s;|tances. In this broad path, the &s;oldiers will ride one after another with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, &s;hooting their ar|rows at the&s;e po&s;ts: they will di&s;mount from their hor&s;es in full gallop, take up their arms, pre&s;ent and &s;hoot again; and, what is &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing, will mount and di&s;mount, in their career, for the &s;ame arrow, making u&s;e of one only, all the way round: but this la&s;t ope|ration is performed only by the more experienced &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Though there is rea&s;on to believe that the u&s;e of ar|tillery is very ancient in China, it appears to have been totally lo&s;t about the beginning of the la&s;t century. But father <HI>Verbie&s;t,</HI> a je&s;uit-mi&s;&s;ionary, revived it, and, by or|der of the Emperor, put them in the way to ca&s;t a new &s;et: and he rai&s;ed the Chine&s;e artillery to the number of 320 pieces. The &s;ame je&s;uit taught them the method of fortifying towns, and of con&s;tructing fortre&s;&s;es; for the je&s;uits in Europe were not contented with &s;ending zealous mi&s;&s;ionaries to China, but thought it nece&s;&s;ary that their zeal &s;hould be united with other u&s;eful talents. This wi&s;e precaution procured them admi&s;&s;ion to the center of the Empire, which, till then, had been &s;hut up again&s;t every &s;tranger.</P>

<P><PB N="145" REF="151">It is now computed that there are more than 2000 places of arms in China, and 3000 towers, or ca&s;tles, di&s;per&s;ed throughout the whole empire; all of which are garri|&s;oned. The fortre&s;&s;es, be&s;ides the principal &s;trength de|rived from their &s;ituation, are defended by a rampart, a brick-wall, towers, and a ditch, filled with water. A cer|tain city of antiquity &s;tood once a &s;iege of ten years, but the neighbours of the Chine&s;e, have long &s;ince lo&s;t the true art of attack.</P>
<P>Nature it&s;elf, however, has &s;ufficiently fortified this country. The &s;ea, with a very &s;hallow &s;hore, borders &s;ix of the provinces, &s;o that large ve&s;&s;els cannot come near them; inacce&s;&s;ible mountains cover them on the we&s;t, and the remaining part is defended by the great wall.</P>
<P>They depend chiefly upon the Tartars for their &s;afety, for &s;ince a Tartar-prince has been upon the throne, every Tartar is enrolled a &s;oldier from his cradle; as &s;oon as he is of &s;ufficient age to carry arms, he is di&s;ciplined, and mu&s;t be ready to take the field upon the &s;horte&s;t notice.</P>
<P>When they take the field, their banners are carried in chariots of war, which are little el&s;e than large boxes without covers, that will hold three, fixed upon two low wheels, and drawn by four hor&s;es, conducted by reins, and capari&s;oned with armour. They have a kind of &s;teel petticoat, that &s;urrounds their legs, like Bayes's troop, in
<PB N="146" REF="152">
the Rehear&s;al, and a frontlet of &s;teel put on their faces, with holes to &s;ee through. On one &s;ide of the chariot, is the banner, fixed upright; and on the other &s;ide, are &s;e|veral pikes, lances, and halberts, &s;et up in the &s;ame man|ner. The general rides in a chariot alone, guiding his hor&s;es him&s;elf, with two pikes fixed up before him; the hor&s;es of which are better cloathed and armed, having pieces of armour over their necks and tails; and when &s;o equipped, have very much the appearance of rhinoce|ro&s;es. Even their very tails are cloathed.</P>
<P>Though no kind of &s;ervice rendered to the &s;tate, is either neglected or forgotten, military &s;ervices are much le&s;s &s;o than others. Government, in time of war, be|&s;tows di&s;tinctions and rewards with a lavi&s;h hand; it ex|tends its favours even to the lowe&s;t. If a common hor&s;e or foot-&s;oldier falls in battle, his hair, his bow, or his &s;a|bre, is tran&s;mitted to his family, to be interred in the &s;e|pulchre of his ance&s;tors, in&s;tead of his body: an eulo|gium, &s;uited to his atchievement, is &s;ent to be engraven on his tomb. If an officer falls a &s;acrifice to his coun|try's cau&s;e, either his whole armour, his a&s;hes, his bones, or his whole body, if it can be found, is conveyed to his relations; and according to their re&s;pective ranks, cer|tain ceremonies are performed in commemoration of &s;ome, and certain monuments erected to others. The body of an officer, or the hair, &amp;c. of a &s;oldier, will be tran&s;ported, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, to the di&s;tance of 1000 or 1500 leagues, if his family is &s;o far di&s;tant. The &s;oldier,
<PB N="147" REF="153">
as well as the officer, is mentioned in the gazette; and his name thus pa&s;&s;es before the eyes of the public, and thence into the general hi&s;tory of the empire. But no &s;ooner &s;hall the war be at an end, and peace re&s;tored, than the appearance of this va&s;t army is almo&s;t lo&s;t. No &s;oldier is permitted to wear arms in public, except when at a re|view, when he mounts guard, or accompanies any man|darin; all return to the &s;tate of, and appear like, plain and humble citizens, and pur&s;ue their re&s;pective trades.</P>
<P>The greater part of the Tartar-&s;oldiers at Peking, with their families, are lodged, either in immen&s;e barracks, erected in the &s;uburbs, or in the adjacent country; and every common man is allowed a complete and &s;eparate apartment for the u&s;e of his family. The officers have hou&s;es; and, in the mid&s;t, are public &s;chools for the edu|cation of the Tartar-youth.</P>
<P>In order to &s;ecure the throne in the pre&s;ent Tartar-fa|mily, the principal, military offices are given to Tartars. A campaign is generally reckoned to be two years &s;ervice. An exact journal is kept of every military tran&s;action, and tho&s;e who have given proofs of valour or &s;uperior &s;kill, are there mentioned with honour. Promotion is the con|&s;equence of merit, if an officer &s;urvives; if not, his re|wards are conferred on his widow, children, or bro|thers. Neither the father of a great family, an only &s;on, nor the &s;on of an aged widow, is obliged to &s;erve as a &s;ol|dier; unle&s;s the &s;tate be in great danger, or in ca&s;es of

the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity, and then government advances money to tho&s;e who enli&s;t, and gives them double pay whil&s;t they &s;erve; one for them&s;elves, and one for their families. In &s;hort, rewards are always ready for tho&s;e who have done their duty, and puni&s;hment is not &s;low in reaching tho&s;e who neglect it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Of their Religion.</HEAD>
<P>FATHER <HI>Amiot,</HI> an impartial and competent judge of the literature, hi&s;tory, and antiquities of China, gives the re&s;ult of his laborious re&s;earches, re&s;pecting the primitive religion of that country, in the following words. <Q>The Chine&s;e are a di&s;tinct people, who have &s;till pre|&s;erved the characteri&s;tic marks of their fir&s;t origin; a people who&s;e primitive doctrine will be found, by tho&s;e who take the trouble of examining it thoroughly, to agree, in its e&s;&s;ential parts, with the doctrines of the cho&s;en people, before Mo&s;es explained it in the &s;acred records; a people who&s;e traditional knowledge, when freed from the ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition of latter ages may be traced back without interruption, for the &s;pace of more than 4000 years, even to the renewal of the human race, by the grand&s;ons of Noah.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="155">There is every hi&s;torical probability to &s;upport the be|lief, that the colony which fir&s;t peopled China, were compo&s;ed of the immediate de&s;cendants of Noah. The <HI>king,</HI> or canonical books of the Chine&s;e, every where con|firm the idea of a Supreme Being, the creator and pre|&s;erver of all things, the rewarder of good actions, and the puni&s;her of evil ones; and, my&s;terious as it may &s;eem, &s;erve to favour the doctrine of a Trinity; and the doctrine of the exi&s;tence and attributes of the Supreme Being, and of the wor&s;hip and homage due to him, has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in China, pure and without change, during a long &s;eries of ages.</P>
<P>Peking contains, at pre&s;ent, two principal temples, the <HI>Tien-tan</HI> and the <HI>Ti-tan;</HI> in the con&s;truction of which, the Chine&s;e have di&s;played all the elegance and magnifi|cence of their architecture. They are both dedicated to the <HI>Chang-ti</HI> or Supreme Lord. The ceremonies with which modern &s;acrifices are attended, are greatly multi|plied, and nothing can equal the &s;plendor and magnifi|cence, with which the Emperor is &s;urrounded, when he performs this &s;olemn and &s;acred duty. He alone, in quality of the father of the nation, has a right to offer up &s;acrifice: and, from the manner, on the one hand, in which he prepares him&s;elf by fa&s;ting, for this high &s;o|lemnity; the innumerable crowd of princes, lords, and officers that &s;urround him in his proce&s;&s;ion to the tem|ple; the magnificence of the ve&s;tments, uten&s;ils, &amp;c. all in gold: and, on the other hand, from the manner in
<PB N="150" REF="156">
which he performs his pro&s;trations, rolls in the du&s;t, and &s;peaks of him&s;elf to the Chang-ti, in terms of the mo&s;t ab|ject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, it may ea&s;ily be perceived, that he a&s;|&s;umes &s;o much pomp and &s;plendor, only for the purpo&s;e of declaring, in a more &s;en&s;ible and &s;triking manner, the infinite di&s;tance between the Supreme Being and man.</P>
<P>The ceremony of plowing and opening the earth, has &s;acrifice previous to it, prepared by fa&s;ting and prayer; and the grain, grown from what he &s;ows, being afterwards pre&s;erved for future &s;acrifices, are convincing proofs that there is more than policy in the encouragement of agri|culture in the ceremony. In &s;hort, it is a religious cere|mony, and has been continued in China, from the re|mote&s;t antiquity.</P>
<P>The religion of this country is, however, after all, but idolatry. But, of all idolaters on the face of the earth, <HI>Nieuhoff</HI> ob&s;erves, that the Chine&s;e have fallen into the fewe&s;t ab&s;urdities. There are three &s;ects here tolerated, that of the Learned, who follow the doctrine of the ancient book, and look upon <HI>Confucius</HI> as their ma&s;ter; that of the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Lao-kien,</HI> which is nothing but a web of ex|travagance and impiety; and that of the Idolaters, who wor&s;hip a divinity called <HI>Fo,</HI> who&s;e opinions were intro|duced from India, about 32 years after our Saviour's crucifixion.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="157">Of the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;ects, are they who profe&s;s regu|larly to &s;tudy it, in order to advance them&s;elves by the degrees and dignities of the empire; the &s;econd has de|generated into magic and enchantment, and the third is nothing but a heap of fables and &s;uper&s;titions. To give &s;ome idea of the&s;e different &s;ects, I &s;hall follow the order of time, in which they took their ri&s;e.</P>
<P>Of the fir&s;t, I have &s;aid, it has the Supreme God for its object, revived by <HI>Confucius,</HI> the Chine&s;e philo&s;opher, who is called in China <HI>Coum-t&s;e,</HI> and who was cotempo|rary with <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> a little before <HI>Socrates;</HI> having been born 483 years before the birth of Chri&s;t. This man was beloved by kings, and the people reverenced him as a &s;aint; and even at this day, they acknowledge no true, hereditary nobility but in his family. He made upwards of 3000 pro&s;elytes, and &s;ent 600 of his di&s;ciples into dif|ferent parts of the Chine&s;e empire, to reform the man|ners of the people, and died in the 73d year of his age. His gravity (&s;ay hi&s;torians), and &s;obriety, his rigorous ab&s;tinence, his contempt of riches and what are common|ly called the goods of this life, his continual attention and watchfulne&s;s over his actions; and, above all, that mo|de&s;ty and humility, which are not to be found among the Grecian &s;ages: all the&s;e would tempt us to believe that he was not a mere philo&s;opher, formed by rea&s;on only, but a man in&s;pired by God, for the reformation of the world, and to check that torrent of idolatry and &s;uper|&s;tition, which was going to over&s;pread that particular
<PB N="152" REF="158">
part of it. He left &s;everal books of his own compo&s;ing, full of fine principles of morality; which he ingenuou&s;ly owned, were collected from tho&s;e wi&s;e legi&s;lators <HI>Yao</HI> and <HI>Chun,</HI> the fir&s;t Emperors of China; and who lived 500 years before him. Tho&s;e books are held, at pre&s;ent, in the highe&s;t e&s;teem and veneration, as containing all he could collect of the ancient laws, which are looked upon as the mo&s;t perfect rule of government.</P>
<P>The &s;ect of <HI>Tao-&s;&s;&eacute;,</HI> was founded by a philo&s;opher, named <HI>Lao-kiun</HI> or <HI>Lao-t&s;&eacute;,</HI> who was born in 603 of the chri&s;tian aera; he was librarian to one of the Emperors, and left a collection of 5000 &s;entences. His morality bears a great re&s;emblance to the doctrines of <HI>Epicurus,</HI> and con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in bani&s;hing all vehement de&s;ires and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing impetuous pa&s;&s;ions. His di&s;ciples afterwards changed his doctrines, and &s;aid it was po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover a liquor, that would make the drinker of it immortal. This fooli&s;h idea, led them to the &s;tudy of chemi&s;try; afterwards to &s;earch for the philo&s;opher's &s;tone; till, at la&s;t, they were lo&s;t in all the wild extravagancies of ma|gic; and the weakne&s;s of preceeding Emperors too much encouraged it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tao-&s;s&eacute;,</HI> at pre&s;ent, offer up three different vic|tims to the &s;pirit they invoke, a hog, a fi&s;h, and a bird, and follow up their incantations with grimaces and horrible cries. Some of them in China, pretend to be fortune-tellers; and ridiculou&s;ly as they act, their chief is inve&s;ted
<PB N="153" REF="159">
by government, with the dignity of grand mandarin, which his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors enjoy, and he re&s;ides in a &s;umptu|ous palace in the province of Kiang-&s;i. The &s;uper&s;titious confidence repo&s;ed in him, attracts a crowd of followers, who flock there for cures, from all parts of the empire, and to know their fortune. And this mandarin di&s;tri|butes &s;mall pieces of paper, filled with magic characters, to all around him, who depart &s;atisfied, and without regretting the fatigue or expence of the&s;e pious pil|grimages.</P>
<P>This &s;ect, &s;till more pernicious, and much wider dif|fu&s;ed throughout China, than the preceding, came ori|ginally from India: it was introduced by the Emperor Ming-ti, from a dream. He happened to dream, one night, &s;ays hi&s;tory, and a &s;entence which <HI>Confucius</HI> often repeated, occurred to his mind, <HI>viz.</HI> "That the Mo&s;t Holy was to be found in the we&s;t." On this he &s;ent am|ba&s;&s;adors into the Indies, to di&s;cover who this &s;aint was, and there, &s;uppo&s;ing they had di&s;covered him among the wor&s;hippers of the idol Fo, brought the idol into China, and with it the fables, wherewith the Indian books were filled. This was in the 65th year of the Chri&s;tian aera.</P>
<P>The prie&s;ts attached to the wor&s;hip of Fo, are called, by the Siame&s;e, <HI>Talapoins;</HI> by the Tartars, <HI>Lamas;</HI> by the Chine&s;e, <HI>Ho-chang;</HI> and by the Japane&s;e, <HI>Bonzes;</HI> by which latter name, they are better known in Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="160">One of the principal doctrines of this &s;ect, is tran&s;mi|gration, of which Fo appears to have been the inventor, as he lived 500 years before <HI>Pythagoras;</HI> and as we know that this Grecian philo&s;opher travelled through Egypt and &s;everal parts of India, there can &s;carcely be a doubt of his having borrowed this notion from &s;ome of Fo's di&s;ciples. Another part of their doctrine, is the wor&s;hip of ance&s;tors. Every Chine&s;e keeps in his hou&s;e, a table whereon is written the names of his father, grand-father, and great grand-father; before which they frequently burn incen&s;e and pro&s;trate them&s;elves; and when the fa|ther of a family dies, the name of the great grand-father is era&s;ed, and that of the decea&s;ed added, to make up the number.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not here attempt to examine all the errors of the doctine of Fo; its folly and ab&s;urdity will &s;ufficiently appear, if the ideas on which it is founded be only men|tioned. <Q>Nothing, (&s;ay they) is the beginning and end of all that exi&s;ts. From nothing our fir&s;t parents &s;prung, and to nothing &s;hall we all return. All beings are, in fact, the &s;ame, their only difference con&s;i&s;ts in their qualities and figure; the univer&s;al principle of which they con&s;i&s;t, is &s;o &s;ubtle, &s;imple and pure, as to be, in reality, nothing; and to be in a &s;tate of re&s;t, and obtain happine&s;s, we mu&s;t endeavour, by con&s;tant meditation, and frequent conque&s;t over our&s;elves, to acquire a likene&s;s to this principle, and to obtain this end, we mu&s;t accu&s;tom our&s;elves to do nothing, will
<PB N="155" REF="161">
nothing, feel nothing, and wi&s;h for nothing; and when we have acquired this &s;tate of happy in&s;en&s;ibility, vir|tue and vice, rewards and puni&s;hments, providence and immortality are out of the que&s;tion. The nearer a man approaches to the nature of a &s;tone or a log, the nearer he is to perfection: all holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ting in cea&s;ing to exi&s;t, and being annihilated.</Q></P>
<P>Can any one believe that a philo&s;ophy &s;o ab&s;urd would have found parti&s;ans in China? But &s;o it did; and the following are the tenets preached by the Bonzes, who profe&s;s this doctrine. They admit of di&s;tinction be|tween good and evil, and the doctrine of future rewards and puni&s;hments. They &s;ay, as Chri&s;tians do of their Saviour, that Fo came upon earth to &s;erve mankind, and to redeem &s;inners; that by him all &s;ins are expiated, and that, through him alone they are to have a happy regeneration in the life to come. They have five pre|cepts which they enjoin a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of. 1. Not to kill any living creature. 2. Not to take away the goods of another. 3. Not to pollute them&s;elves by un|cleanne&s;s. 4. Not to lie. And, 5. Not to drink wine. But above all, they recommend acts of mercy, to treat their Bonzes well, to erect temples and mona&s;teries for them, and &s;upply them with every nece&s;&s;ary, that they may be enabled, by their prayers, to merit forgivene&s;s for them, and a remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins. <Q>At the funeral of your parents (&s;ay they), burn paper gilt with gold and &s;ilver, gold and &s;ilver-&s;tuffs; the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances will
<PB N="156" REF="162">
be changed into real gold and &s;ilver, (and &s;o it is for them) in the other world, and all the&s;e riches will be tran&s;mitted to your fathers. Wo unto you, if you obey not the&s;e precepts! Your &s;ouls will be delivered over, after death, to the &s;evere&s;t torments, and be &s;ub|jected to the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting changes: you &s;hall live again in the form of dogs, rats, &s;erpents, hor&s;es, and mules, and &s;hall be for ever expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t di&s;mal and wretched tran&s;migrations.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Le Comte</HI> tells us of one whom the Bonzes had per&s;uaded, that his &s;oul was to go into one of the Empe|ror's po&s;t-hor&s;es, that conveys his di&s;patches; and they had advi&s;ed him to eat little and endure it patiently, and God might be induced, the next remove, to let him pa&s;s into &s;ome per&s;on of quality. But the man was under &s;uch horror at being a po&s;t-hor&s;e, that his being a man of figure afterwards, gave him but little &s;atisfaction: he could not &s;leep, day or night; his imaginations led him to think he was already in harne&s;s, and &s;tarting at the &s;mack of the po&s;tilion's whip. <Q>I awake (would he &s;ay) all in a &s;weat, half frantic,</Q> not knowing whether he was &s;till a man, or metamorpho&s;ed into a hor&s;e. He flew, therefore, to <HI>Le Comte,</HI> and begged of him to bapti&s;e him and make him a chri&s;tian, that he might not undergo, when he died, &s;o di&s;agreeable a change.</P>
<P>Although each family is particularly &s;ollicitous to pay the utmo&s;t honour to the idols they think proper to
<PB N="157" REF="163">
adopt, it does not appear that they have any &s;incere re|&s;pect for them. In ca&s;es, where they have often prayed for &s;ucce&s;s, the patience of their votaries is wearied out, and they will make their offerings to other deities. Others, le&s;s moderate, will treat them roughly, kick them about and load them with abu&s;ive language. <Q>Thou dog of a &s;pirit (will they cry), have we not lodged thee in a commodious temple? Art thou not well gilt, well fed, and well incen&s;ed? Yet, notwith|&s;tanding all our care and re&s;pect, thou art ungrateful enough to refu&s;e us, even things that are nece&s;&s;ary.</Q> And with this will tie the idol with cords, drag it through the kennels, and be&s;patter it with filth and dirt, to puni&s;h it, for all the perfume they have before lavi&s;hed on it: but, if, during this &s;cene of frantic folly, they &s;hould chance to obtain what they pray for, they will wa&s;h, clean, and carry back the image with great com|po&s;ure, to its niche, pro&s;trate them&s;elves before it, make the humble&s;t apologies for their ra&s;hne&s;s and pre|&s;umption, and beg of it forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Le Comte</HI> entertains us with a &s;tory which happened while he re&s;ided at Nanking. A certain man who&s;e only daughter lay dangerou&s;ly ill, having tried all the art of the phy&s;icians, without effect, thought proper to implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the gods. Humbly did he pro&s;trate him&s;elf before his idol, and offer, not only prayers, but alms and &s;acrifice, for the recovery of his child. The Bonzes, who benefited by this, promi&s;ed a cure, on the
<PB N="158" REF="164">
part and faith of the idol, but promi&s;ed in vain. The girl died, and the father, to be revenged, pro&s;ecuted the god in form, by laying his ca&s;e in writing before the judge. After having repre&s;ented, in the livelie&s;t terms, the deceitful conduct of the unju&s;t divinity, he prayed that exemplary puni&s;hment might be inflicted on it for its breach of &s;aith. <Q>If the &s;pirit,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>had power to cure my daughter, it was guilty of fraud, in taking my money, and &s;uffering her to die. If it had not power, it was equally as bad to pretend to it. By what right then, does it a&s;&s;ume the character of a god? Is it for nothing that we adore it, and that all the province offers it &s;acrifice?</Q> In &s;hort, he con|cluded, that whether it was want of power, or malice in the idol, its temple ought to be ra&s;ed, its mini&s;ters bani&s;hed with di&s;grace, and it&s;elf puni&s;hed in its own per&s;on.</P>
<P>This affair being, by the judge, con&s;idered as impor|tant, was referred, by him, to the governor; who, un|willing to have any thing to do with the gods, begged the viceroy to enquire into it: he did, and finding the Bonzes much alarmed, advi&s;ed the complainant to drop the &s;uit; telling him, it was injudicious to quarrel with this kind of &s;pirits, who were naturally revengeful. <Q>I am afraid (continued he) that if you carry this matter too far, they will play you &s;ome, bad trick. Believe me, you had much better accommodate the matter with the Bonzes. They have a&s;&s;ured me, that the idol will
<PB N="159" REF="165">
hearken to rea&s;on, provided you do not provoke it to the contrary.</Q></P>
<P>The man, oppre&s;&s;ed with grief for the lo&s;s of his child, per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution, and declared he would rather die, than relax in his reque&s;t. <Q>I am determined, my lord,</Q> &s;aid he. <Q>The idol may conceive, he may commit inju&s;tice with impunity, becau&s;e no one will have the courage to attack him; but he &s;hall find him|&s;elf mi&s;taken, and we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee which of the two is the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and malicious.</Q></P>
<P>The viceroy, finding he could not prevail on the man to give up his point, ordered the trial to be brought on. The idol, not wanting partizans, tho&s;e to whom the Bonzes gave money to defend it, found its right incon|te&s;tible, and pleaded &s;o &s;trongly for the god, that he could not have &s;poke better for him&s;elf. But the oppo|nent was a man of much greater penetration and &s;hrewd|ne&s;s, and had, on his part, not been &s;paring of his mo|ney; of cour&s;e, purcha&s;ed as many proofs as were requi|&s;ite, convinced that the devil would be very cunning if he with&s;tood <HI>golden</HI> arguments: and the con&s;equence was, a decree was given in his favour. The idol was con|demned to perpetual bani&s;hment, as u&s;ele&s;s in the em|pire, its temple was demoli&s;hed, and the Bonzes, who repre&s;ented its per&s;on, were puni&s;hed in an exemplary manner.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="166">The&s;e Bonzes, or prie&s;ts, are generally men of little or no character, and, being brought up in idlene&s;s, de|vote them&s;elves to this kind of life, merely for a main|tenance.

The following, extracted from <HI>The new Memoirs re&s;pecting the pre&s;ent Sate of China,</HI> will divert our readers.</P>
<P>Two of the&s;e Bonzes perceiving one day, in the court-yard of a rich pea&s;ant, two large ducks &s;itting before the door, began to &s;igh and weep bitterly. The good wo|man of the hou&s;e, who perceived them from her cham|ber, enquired the cau&s;e of their grief. "We know," replied they, <Q>that the &s;ouls of our fathers have pa&s;&s;ed into the bodies of tho&s;e ducks, and the apprehen&s;ion of your killing them will kill us.</Q> <Q>Very true, (&s;aid the woman), we meant to kill them, but &s;ince you tell me they are your fathers, we will pre&s;erve them.</Q> This was not what the Bonzes wanted; they wanted the ducks.&mdash;<Q>Alas! (returned they), your hu&s;band may not have that charity, and, be a&s;&s;ured, that &s;hould any ac|cident happen to them, it will prove fatal to us.</Q> In a word, the woman was &s;o affected with their pretended tears, that &s;he gave the ducks into their own care, which they very re&s;pectfully took charge of, after twenty pro&s;|trations; but, the &s;ame evening, put their feathered fa|thers on the &s;pit, and made a hearty meal of them.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="167">There is &s;carce a &s;ource of hypocri&s;y which the&s;e fel|lows are not up to.

<P><Q>I met one day, in the middle of the village, a young, bri&s;k Bonze, who&s;e mildne&s;s and mode&s;ty in a&s;king cha|rity, was very likely to en&s;ure him &s;ucce&s;s. He was &s;tanding erect in a kind of narrow, clo&s;e chair, &s;tuck full, in the in&s;ide, with nails, the &s;harp points of which projected &s;o far, and left him &s;o little room, that, move which way he would, they were &s;ure to prick him. Two men, hired for the purpo&s;e, carried him, very gently, from hou&s;e to hou&s;e; and, when he was &s;et down, he begged compa&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>

Each nail is worth &s;ix-pence; but there is none of them, but will prove a &s;ource of ble&s;&s;ings to you and yours.

<P><Q>At that time I was pa&s;&s;ing by: the Bonze &s;aw me, and addre&s;&s;ed me as he did the re&s;t.

<P><Q>He thanked me very mildly and calmly for my ad|vice, but told me, he &s;hould be much more obliged to me, if I would buy a dozen of his nails, which would certainly procure me a &s;afe and plea&s;ant jour|ney.

He uttered the&s;e words, with an air and action, that, at another time, would

have made me laugh; but at this, it excited my com|pa&s;&s;ion, to &s;ee this wretched captive of the devil, &s;uf|fering more to de&s;troy his &s;oul, than a chri&s;tian is ob|liged to endure to be &s;aved.</Q></P>
<P>All Bonzes, indeed, are not &s;o indu&s;trious, for many will renounce the&s;e painful means of getting alms; but, to attain the &s;ame end, will &s;ometimes go to the extre|mity of committing murder. Some years ago, &s;ays <HI>Le Comte,</HI> the governor of a city, pa&s;&s;ing along the highway, with his cu&s;tomary train, &s;aw a large crowd a&s;&s;embled, and found, on enquiry, that the Bonzes were celebrating a fe&s;tival. They had con&s;tructed, on a large &s;caffold, or theatre, a very high machine, at the top of which a young man put forth his head, above a &s;mall ballu&s;trade that &s;urrounded it. Nothing could be &s;een but his head; and of this, only his eyes &s;eemed at liberty, which he rolled about with an apparent phrenzy. A little lower, on this &s;caffolding, an old Bonze was explaining to the crowd, the &s;acrifice which the young man, above, was going to make of his life, by throwing him&s;elf into a deep &s;tream, which ran by the highway-&s;ide. "He will not die," &s;aid this Bonze, <Q>becau&s;e he mu&s;t be received at the bottom of the waters, by the charitable &s;pirits, who will ha&s;ten to protect him; in a word, it will be the greate&s;t hap|pine&s;s that can befal him. A hundred other per&s;ons have offered to &s;upply his place; but his zeal, piety and virtues, have given him the preference.</Q> The mandarin having heard this tale, &s;aid, the young man
<PB N="164" REF="172">
&s;hewed wonderful courage; he &s;hould like to talk with him; and begged he might be brought down to him. The old Bonze, frightened at this reque&s;t, immediately oppo&s;ed it, prote&s;ting, that all would be lo&s;t, if the victim only opened his mouth; and that he could not an&s;wer for the mi&s;chief that might thence ari&s;e to the province. <Q>The evil you fear,</Q> &s;aid the mandarin, <Q>I will take upon my&s;elf: bring him down.</Q> The young man, hearing this, made a noi&s;e, and rolled his eyes about. "See," &s;aid the Bonze, <Q>his agitation and his looks! Your honour will drive him to de&s;pair, and he will expire with grief.</Q> The mandarin, firm to his re&s;olves, ordered his attend|ants to mount the &s;caffold, and bring him down by force. They immediately obeyed, and found him bound and gagged. As &s;oon as he was relea&s;ed, and able to &s;peak, he cried, <Q>Ah! my lord, grant me vengeance on the&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, who intended to drown me. I am a bachelor going to court, to attend the cu&s;tomary examinations, and the&s;e Bonzes &s;eized me ye&s;terday, and this morning bound me to this machine, in the manner you found me, before break of day, determining to throw me into the water in the evening, and to perform their abominable my&s;teries, at the expence of my life.</Q>&mdash; As &s;oon as he began to &s;peak, the Bonzes fled; but the officers of ju&s;tice, who always make part of a governor's train, &s;oon overtook &s;ome of them. Their chief was im|mediately thrown into the river and drowned; and the re&s;t were conducted to pri&s;on, and afterwards puni&s;hed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they de&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="173">A letter of Father <HI>Laureati,</HI> an Italian je&s;uit, gives us a &s;tory of a different kind, but equally de&s;criptive of the villainy of the&s;e men. Near the city of Fou-tcheou, there was formerly a famous pagod, inhabited by the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Bonzes of the province. The daughter of a Chine&s;e doctor, who was going in a covered chair, ac|companied by two, female attendants, to her father's country-hou&s;e, had the curio&s;ity to &s;ee this temple, and &s;ent to beg of the Bonzes that they would retire, until &s;he had &s;aid her prayers. The chief Bonze, de&s;irous of &s;ee|ing this young lady, &s;ecreted him&s;elf behind the altar; he had no &s;ooner beheld her, than he was &s;mitten with her charms, and became &s;o de&s;perately enamoured, that all thoughts of danger vani&s;hed, and he conceived, it would be very ea&s;y to carry off a feeble woman, &s;o badly at|tended. Accordingly, he ordered &s;ome other Bonzes, his confidants, to lay hold of her attendants, whil&s;t he forced the young lady to &s;atisfy his brutal de&s;ires, in &s;pite of all her cries and tears.</P>
<P>The father did not long remain ignorant of the cau&s;e of his daughter's ab&s;ence. He knew &s;he had entered the pagoda, and had then di&s;appeared, and required, that &s;he &s;hould be re&s;tored. And, on the Bonzes declaring, that &s;he left the temple as &s;oon as &s;he had &s;aid her prayers, the father applied to the Tartar-general of the province, and demanded ju&s;tice again&s;t the ravi&s;hers of his daughter. The Bonzes, relying on the credulity of the father and the governor, informed them, that the god Fo, having fallen
<PB N="166" REF="174">
in love with her, had carried her off; and the delinquent took pains to per&s;wade the father, that he and his fa|mily were highly honoured, by this di&s;tingui&s;hed mark of the god's re&s;pect. But the Tartar-general had too much &s;en&s;e to be amu&s;ed with &s;uch fables; he re&s;olved to &s;earch the pagoda; and, whil&s;t he was prying into every rece&s;s, heard &s;ome confu&s;ed cries, which &s;eemed to pro|ceed from the bottom of a rock: he immediately ad|vanced towards the place, and perceived an iron-gate, &s;hut, leading to a grotto. Having ordered it to be broke open, he de&s;cended into a &s;ubterranean apartment, where he found the young lady, and above 20 other females, who had been confined in that di&s;mal abode. The go|vernor, after having relieved them, &s;et fire to the four corners of the edifice, and de&s;troyed, in the &s;ame flames, the temple, altars and gods, with their infamous mi|ni&s;ters.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the infatuation of the people, in favour of popular &s;uper&s;tition, the Bonzes are held in contempt; for, &s;pringing from the very refu&s;e of the people, they are, in general, but fanatical impo&s;tors. To perpetuate this &s;ect, they purcha&s;e young children, and bring them up to their own mind, and, after all, are ignorant even of their faith. Though they are under no regular hierarchy, they have &s;uperiors among them: &s;ome collect alms; and &s;ome acquiring literary knowledge, are commi&s;&s;ioned to vi&s;it the <HI>literati,</HI> and the hou&s;es of the great; and old
<PB N="167" REF="175">
men, rendered venerable by years, intermix with the women, and pre&s;ide at their religious a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>The&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, or clubs, con&s;i&s;t of from 15 to 30 ladies of rank, when widows, or advanced in life. One of them is elected &s;uperior for a year; and at her hou&s;e the&s;e meetings are held, where they have a kind of chapel. On common-days, when the&s;e female devotees are a&s;&s;embled, &s;uch an aged Bonze enters, and &s;ings &s;e|veral anthems to the god Fo; and, after repeatedly &s;ing|ing, <HI>O-mi-to Fo!</HI> and dinging on the bottom of &s;everal &s;mall kettles, which they beat, they place them&s;elves at tables, and fini&s;h their noi&s;y devotion with mirth, and a good repa&s;t.</P>
<P>But, on days of greater &s;olemnity, their place of wor&s;hip is ornamented with a number of idols (one of which is the idol of Immortality, and repre&s;ented by a very fat man, &s;itting cro&s;s-legged, with a great, naked belly, &s;uch as we have often &s;een in china-ware in England), and a variety of paintings, under a hundred, different forms, ex|hibiting the various puni&s;hments inflicted on the wicked in hell. A grand, or &s;uperior Bonze, is at this time in|vited, who attends with a whole train of mini&s;ters, and the prayer and fea&s;ting continues for &s;even days. One of the great bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of this day, is to prepare and con&s;ecrate trea&s;ures for the other world. To this purpo&s;e, they erect a &s;mall edifice, with paper, painted and gilt, re&s;embling a hou&s;e, and being fini&s;hed with great care and accuracy,
<PB N="168" REF="176">
they &s;upply it with every piece of u&s;eful furniture found in the hou&s;es of the opulent; and fill it with a great num|ber of boxes, in which they depo&s;it pieces of gilt paper, as ingots of gold and &s;ilver. A hundred of the&s;e &s;mall boxes, are de&s;igned to redeem tho&s;e &s;inners from the dreadful puni&s;hments of the Infernal King, who have nothing to give; twenty are al&s;o put a&s;ide, to bribe the officers of the tribunal of this King of &s;hadows: the hou&s;e is for lodging and boarding, in the other world, where they each hope to buy &s;ome office, or public e&s;tabli&s;hment. The whole of the&s;e imaginary riches being put into their re&s;pective boxes, are &s;ecured by a paper lock; the hou&s;e, or palace-door, is then &s;ecured. When the per&s;on who has fitted up this toy, happens to die, the paper-hou&s;e, and it, contents, are burnt at the grave, with great forma|lity; in order that the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed may take out the trea&s;ure, which they conceive, will be then converted into realities, and enable it to make its peace with the King of Terrors. At the&s;e times, the prie&s;ts who think differently, are not &s;atisfied with paper-money, but expect to be &s;ee'd with that which is more &s;ub&s;tantial.</P>
<P>Thus is China become a prey to all &s;orts of ridiculous and extravagant opinions; and though &s;ome of the learn|ed oppo&s;e the&s;e &s;ects, treat them as here&s;ies, and have &s;ometimes inclined the court to exterminate them throughout the empire, yet &s;uch inclinations have been attended with no effect; either, through a fear of excit|ing commotions among the people, or, becau&s;e they
<PB N="169" REF="177">
have had &s;ecret favourers and protectors among the learn|ed them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The learned, of modern times, have e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ect of their own. The&s;e give the fir&s;t principle of all things the name of <HI>Tai-ki,</HI> which they &s;ay is impo&s;&s;ible to be explained, being di&s;tinct from matter; and, of cour&s;e, they have no terms to explain it by. However, they compare it to the ridge of a hou&s;e, that unites the roof; to the root of a tree; to the axle-tree of a chariot; to a kingdom in which all things live; and affirm it to be the ba&s;is of every thing. They hold it to be eternal, infinite, perfect, and the e&s;&s;ence of all other beings, But, &s;ome of the mi&s;&s;ionaries, have been per&s;waded, that all the learned in the empire are athei&s;ts; and, there is &s;carce an individual, but what forms imaginary deities of his own. Every city of China is filled with fortune-tellers, who are generally blind people, that play on a lute, and go about, from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, to tell fortunes, for a &s;mall piece of money. There are other people who con&s;ult oracles, re&s;pecting tran&s;actions they are about to perform; and the&s;e oracles, or kind of magic, are managed by the prie&s;ts: and there are others, as extravagant in opinion as the human mind is capable of inventing. The&s;e are called <HI>Fong-choui,</HI> which &s;ignifies wind and water; or the lucky, and unlucky, &s;ituation of a hou&s;e, or other building. If clo&s;e to the hou&s;e of one of the&s;e men, a neighbour has built another, but on a different plan; &s;hould the angle formed by its roof, &s;tand in a particular
<PB N="170" REF="178">
direction, it is enough to occa&s;ion utter ruin and de&s;truc|tion; and the proprietor of the fir&s;t hou&s;e lives ever after in terror, conceiving, that he and his po&s;terity, will be continually expo&s;ed to the malign influence of this un|lucky angle. The erection of the new building becomes the epoch of univer&s;al hatred, between the two families, and perhaps ends in a law-&s;uit; and, when a judicial proce&s;s can give no relief, the only alternative left, is, for the pro|prietor of the fir&s;t hou&s;e, to place the figure of a devour|ing dragon on his roof, with his mouth directed to the hated angle, and form an opinion, that this dragon will, from time to time, devour its malignity; his apprehen|&s;ions of ill luck will begin to &s;ub&s;ide, and tranquility be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re&s;tored to the family.</P>
<P>The governor of Kien-tchang took this <HI>wi&s;e</HI> method to &s;ecure him&s;elf from the Je&s;uit's church, which, having been built on an eminence, overlooked his palace. He did not, however, depend entirely on the protection of this tutelary dragon, but altered the po&s;ition of his principal apartments, rai&s;ing, at the di&s;tance of 200 paces from the church, a kind of large facade, three &s;tories high, the better to break the influence of the <HI>Tien-tchu-tang</HI> or Temple of the Lord of Heaven. It unluckily happened, that the death of the governor's &s;ucce&s;&s;or was attributed to this facade. The mandarin was attacked by an a&s;tmatic complaint; he &s;pit up a phlegm of a white colour, which was owing, they &s;aid, to the walls of the facade being painted white; they were, therefore, daubed over with black, in hopes of
<PB N="171" REF="179">
producing a contrary effect: but in vain, he died; and it was concluded, that the painting of the walls black, was not done &s;oon enough.</P>
<P>I &s;hould never have done, was I to relate all the &s;to|ries that are told of this kind. There are &s;ome men who follow no other profe&s;&s;ion than pointing out mountains, hills, and other places, that have an a&s;pect favourable for burying-places: aad, when a Chine&s;e is per&s;waded of the truth of &s;uch information, there is no &s;um that he would not &s;acrifice to purcha&s;e it; from a conviction, in his own mind, that all the happine&s;s of his life will depend upon it. Such is their infatuation, and &s;uch their &s;uper&s;tition; that if this, or that per&s;on, is endowed with a greater &s;hare of genius, if he is fortunate in life, ri&s;es rapidly to the degree of Doctor, is promoted to the rank of &s;upe|rior mandarin, ble&s;&s;ed with a numerous family, has le&s;s &s;ickne&s;s than others, and is more &s;ucce&s;sful in trade, it is not owing to knowledge, activity or hone&s;ty, but only to a lucky <HI>Fong-choui;</HI> becau&s;e his hou&s;es, and the burying-places of his ance&s;tors, are happily &s;ituated.</P>
<P>The &s;tudy of letters being the high road to dignities, and it being open to per&s;ons of all degrees, there mu&s;t needs be many of mean extraction brought up in idolatry, and, when they become mandarins, either through the prejudice of their education, or a public complai&s;ance to the people, and to maintain the public tranquility, &s;eem to adopt the opinions of every different &s;ect, and the
<PB N="172" REF="180">
rather, becau&s;e the Chine&s;e, of all ranks, &s;eldom look any further than the pre&s;ent life. The mandarins, who are living deities of the country, have &s;eldom any god but their fortune; and this being liable to &s;everal, trouble&s;ome vici&s;&s;itudes, their principal care is to avoid misfortunes, and keep them&s;elves &s;afe in their po&s;ts. The &s;tudents, who may be con&s;idered as the le&s;&s;er nobility, have nothing at heart but a certain honour, which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ucceeding in their examinations, and in rai&s;ing them&s;elves to the highe&s;t degree. Merchants think of nothing, from morning to night, but their bu&s;ine&s;s; and the re&s;t of the people are entirely taken up in procuring a livelihood, which con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;mall quantity of rice and pul&s;e. In this manner is all the time of the Chine&s;e taken up; reli|gion, with them, being only a &s;econdary thought.</P>
<P>The Emperor, being a Tartar, follows the idolatry of his own nation, which does not differ much from that of the Chine&s;e; except it be, that they wor&s;hip a living man, whom they &s;tile <HI>Lama;</HI> which, <HI>Le Comte</HI> &s;ays, is the &s;ame with the god <HI>Fo,</HI> only wor&s;hipped under a &s;en|&s;ible figure. I have dwelt a good deal upon this reli|gion, when I was &s;peaking of the Tartars throughout Siberia. This Lama receives here, the title of <HI>Eternal Father;</HI> and all the Ea&s;tern Tartars have the highe&s;t ve|neration for him. He is &s;hewn in a dark place, in his pa|lace, illuminated with lamps. He &s;its cro&s;s-legged, on a cu&s;hion, rai&s;ed above the ground, dre&s;&s;ed in the riche&s;t robes; and all that approach him, fall pro&s;trate, and ki&s;s
<PB N="173" REF="181">
his feet. He is of &s;uch authority, that no king is crown|ed, till he has made rich pre&s;ents to this pretended deity, and implored his ble&s;&s;ing. His re&s;idence is at Baran|tola, where he holds a court like a king, but does not meddle with &s;ecular government, and may properly be &s;tiled, the Tartar's Pope.</P>
<P>Since a Tartar-prince has been &s;eated on the throne of China, the prie&s;ts of this great Lama, who are al&s;o called <HI>Lamas,</HI> &s;erve as chaplains to the Tartar-nobility living at Peking. The Emperor him&s;elf, for rea&s;ons of &s;tate, &s;hews both Lamas and Bonzes a particular re&s;pect; but the je&s;uits ob&s;erve, that he is no &s;lave to their faith, that he &s;ees through the folly of it, and laughs, in private, at their extravagant fables. But 'tis acknowledged, that the Emperor &s;till pays tho&s;e honours to <HI>Confucius</HI> that others do, and &s;acrifices in the heathen temples; and, though the je&s;uits would have us believe, that he adores only the Supreme Lord of the Univer&s;e, and that nothing but rea&s;ons of &s;tate prevent his embracing chri&s;tianity, yet they acknowledge, at other times, that he a&s;&s;ures them, <Q>he cannot believe the chri&s;tian religion; that whatever difficulties there are in it, if he was convinced of the truth of it, he would not delay a moment to embrace it; and that if he became a chri&s;tian, the whole empire would &s;oon follow his example.</Q></P>
<P>Through the favour of the late Emperor, the chri&s;tian religion gained &s;uch ground, that they had 200 churches
<PB N="174" REF="182">
and chapels, very well filled with converts, but the&s;e are of the poorer &s;ort, chri&s;tianity making but &s;low progre&s;s among&s;t the wealthy. They had al&s;o, when <HI>Le Comte</HI> was there, three bi&s;hops, appointed by the king of Por|tugal, who claims a right to the churches in the ea&s;t; one of the&s;e bi&s;hops was at Peking, one at Nanking, and one at Macoa. The better &s;ort of people are not only of|fended at the doctrine of the Trinity and Incarnation, but the magi&s;trates, and opulent, are &s;o univer&s;ally given up to cheating and extortion, by which they acquire e&s;tates, that the Roman catholic doctrine of re&s;titution does not agree with them. Parting with their women is another great objection to their embracing the chri&s;tian faith; and to preach to the women to live with one man, when their hu&s;bands have an ab&s;olute power over them, and can &s;ell and transfer them from one to another, as often as they plea&s;e, &s;eems to very little purpo&s;e: however, the mi&s;|&s;ionaries a&s;&s;ure us, that they converted above 50,000, in the &s;pace of a very few years. Were Prote&s;tant preach|ers to be &s;ent among&s;t them, in all likelihood they would better &s;ucceed; for, though the je&s;uits have been very complai&s;ant to the Chine&s;e in many in&s;tances, and winked at their wor&s;hip to <HI>Confucius,</HI> and their decea&s;ed parents, yet they rigorou&s;ly exact their putting away all their wives and concubines but one, as a nece&s;&s;ary qualification to their admittance into the chri&s;tian faith; which is with them &s;uch a difficulty, that they cannot get over it, it being contrary to the laws and cu&s;toms of the country to put away a wife, but for &s;ome mi&s;demeanour; and the rela|tions
<PB N="175" REF="183">
of the woman would demand ju&s;tice upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion; but it would al&s;o be hard to &s;eparate children from their &s;everal mothers, which mu&s;t be done in this ca&s;e, or the father mu&s;t part with the children too, and commit the education of them to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>As for the women, it is not conceivable what effect this doctrine has upon them. One who had no other objection to chri&s;tianity, very well replied to a certain father on this occa&s;ion:&mdash;<Q>Sir, I belong to a mandarin who bought me; if I leave him, he has a right to follow me, bring me back again, and make a &s;lave of me. But, &s;up|po&s;ing I could avoid his pur&s;uit, where could I fly? My relations, who &s;old me, dare not harbour me; and I &s;hould infallibly fall into the hands of &s;ome other per&s;on, who would keep me in the &s;tate I &s;eek to avoid. I mu&s;t, therefore, remain in the hou&s;e where I am: and how &s;hall I be able to re&s;i&s;t a bruti&s;h fellow, who con&s;ults only his lu&s;t, and will be ju&s;tified by the laws and example of the whole empire? It will be to no purpo&s;e to lay before him the holine&s;s of chri&s;tianity, which I de&s;ire to embrace; neither my tears nor my entreaties, nor even the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance I can make, will be able to hinder him.</Q>&mdash;So that the mi&s;|&s;ionaries them&s;elves, check the increa&s;e of that faith they wi&s;h to propagate, by propo&s;ing impo&s;&s;ibilities, which &s;urely the Divine goodne&s;s cannot countenance; nor can it enter into the heart of man to believe, that our Saviour
<PB N="176" REF="184">
him&s;elf, would have refu&s;ed &s;uch a pro&s;elyte, who, in all other in&s;tances, was &s;incere.</P>
<P>But as all the great men in the empire will certainly remain aver&s;e to chri&s;tianity, if nothing le&s;s than parting with their women will &s;atisfy the je&s;uits; &s;o, on the other hand, the women will infallibly promote it, to the utmo&s;t of their power, that every one may have her man to her|&s;elf, and be a little more on a level with our &s;ex. Were the intere&s;t of the ladies as good in that part of the world, as it is here, the je&s;uits would need no &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to carry their point. It is very unfortunate for the je&s;uits, that that they can &s;carce have any opportunity of approaching the fair-&s;ex; whatever purity, or &s;elf-de|nial, they may preach, or practi&s;e, the Chine&s;e under|&s;tand human nature too well, to &s;uffer the mo&s;t mortified of them to conver&s;e, <HI>tete a tete,</HI> with their wives; for the&s;e &s;urly men will not tru&s;t their women even in a church with the men.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of chri&s;tianity when <HI>Le Comte</HI> was there; but we under&s;tand &s;ince, that the Emperor, di&s;lik|ing the conduct of the mi&s;&s;ionaries, has bani&s;hed them all, and overthrown their churches; &s;o the chri&s;tian religion is lo&s;ing ground daily.</P>
<P>Among the many religions in China, there are not wanting Jews; and the di&s;covery of a &s;ynagogue in an empire &s;o remote, is a circum&s;tance too intere&s;ting to
<PB N="177" REF="185">
be here omitted. This Jewi&s;h colony appeared in China, in the year 206 before Chri&s;t, and has continued ever &s;ince; though at pre&s;ent it is reduced to a &s;mall number of families, e&s;tabli&s;hed at Cai-fong, the capital of the pro|vince of Honan. As we are indebted to <HI>F. Gozani,</HI> a Je&s;uit mi&s;&s;ionary, for the fir&s;t knowledge of the&s;e Chine&s;e Jews, we &s;hall give the account from him.</P>
<P>The&s;e Jews con&s;i&s;ted, when <HI>Gozani</HI> was there, of only &s;even families. He paid them a vi&s;it, hoping to find the Old Te&s;tament among them. They have a &s;ynagogue, and a variety of religious books. <Q>I compared my bi|ble,</Q> &s;ays <HI>Gozani,</HI> <Q>with theirs, and found the mo&s;t exact conformity between both.</Q> The&s;e Jews here are called <HI>Tiao-kin-kiao;</HI> and &s;till pre&s;erve &s;everal of the ceremonies mentioned in the Old Te&s;tament: &s;uch as circumci&s;ion, which, they &s;ay, originated from <HI>Abraham;</HI> the fea&s;t of unleavened bread; that of the Pa&s;cal lamb, in commemoration of their departure from Egypt, and of their pa&s;&s;age through the Red Sea, and the Sabbath; and other fe&s;tivals, pre&s;cribed by the ancient law.</P>
<P>The&s;e families form alliances with each other, and never mix with the <HI>Hoei-hoei,</HI> or Mahomedans, to whom they bear no re&s;emblance, either in their books, or religious ceremonies. Their &s;ynagogue is &s;omething like our Eu|ropean churches, being divided into three ai&s;les; that in the middle, like the choir, is occupied by the table of incen&s;e, the chair of Mo&s;es, and the 13 tabernacles, con|&s;tructed
<PB N="178" REF="186">
in the form of an arch, containing 13 copies of the Pentateuch; the two other ai&s;les are &s;et apart as places of prayer: within the building is a pa&s;&s;age, which runs quite round it. The&s;e Jews render homage to <HI>Confucius,</HI> as the <HI>literati</HI> do; and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the &s;olemn cere|monies, performed in halls dedicated to their great men: and, in &s;pring and autumn, practi&s;e certain rites, in honour of their ance&s;tors, as do the Chine&s;e; but do not pre&s;ent them with the fle&s;h of hogs, having, in their hall of ance&s;tors, neither tables, nor images.</P>
<P>They told <HI>Gozani,</HI> that their ance&s;tors came from a kingdom of the we&s;t, called, the kingdom of Judah, which <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> conquered, after they had left Egypt, had cro&s;&s;ed the Red Sea, and traver&s;ed the de|&s;ert; and that the number of Jews, who departed from Egypt, amounted to 600,000 men. They &s;poke to him of the book of Judges, and of David, Solomon, and Ezekiel, who rai&s;ed up dry bones; and of Jonas, who was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, &amp;c. which plainly &s;hews that they have, be&s;ides the Pentateuch, &s;everal other parts of the &s;acred writings. They informed him, that their alphabet was compo&s;ed of 27 letters, but that they generally u&s;ed only 22; which agrees with St. <HI>Jerome</HI>'s account; who &s;ays, that the Hebrews have 22 letters, five of which are double.</P>
<P>The&s;e Jews neither kindle fire, nor dre&s;s any victuals, on Saturday; but prepare their Saturday's food on Friday.
<PB N="179" REF="187">
When they read the bible in their &s;ynagogue, they cover their faces with a tran&s;parent veil, in remembrance of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who came down from the mountain covered, and, in that manner publi&s;hed the decalogue.</P>
<P>When <HI>Gozani</HI> &s;poke to them of the Me&s;&s;iah, promi&s;ed in the holy &s;cripture, they appeared much &s;urpri&s;ed; but, when he told them, that the Me&s;&s;iah was called <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> they replied, that mention was made in their bible of a holy man named <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the &s;on of Sirach, but they were wholly unacquainted with the new <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> of whom he &s;poke.</P>
<P>The Mahomedans have multiplied much more in China, than the Jews. It is above 600 years &s;ince they fir&s;t entered this country, in which they have formed different e&s;tabli&s;hments. For a great number of years, they were pre&s;erved only by marriages, and by alliances which they made; but, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, they have en|crea&s;ed their number, by purcha&s;ing a great number of pagan children, and bringing them up in the principles of their religion. During a famine in Chang-tong, when parents of families were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for food, they bought more than 10,000 children, for whom, when grown up, they procured wives, and built hou&s;es, &s;o that they form|ed whole villages of them. The&s;e in&s;en&s;ibly increa&s;ed; and are now become &s;o numerous, that they entirely ex|clude from tho&s;e places where they re&s;ide, every inhabitant who does not believe in their prophet, and frequent a mo&s;que.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Of their Language.</HEAD>
<P>THE Chine&s;e language is not only one of the mo&s;t ancient in the world, but has the advantage of being &s;till a living one; and there is every probability to believe, that this language has, for 4,000 years, and up|wards, remained always and invariably the &s;ame: China never having changed its inhabitants, never borrowed any thing from foreign nations, and it being univer&s;ally ad|mitted, that the fir&s;t chapters of their canonical book called <HI>Chou-king,</HI> were written in the reign of <HI>Yao,</HI> 2,300 years before the chri&s;tian aera; or, at the late&s;t, under that of <HI>Yu.</HI> Several &s;peeches of the fir&s;t Emperors are there related <HI>verbatim;</HI> which agree with the language now &s;poken; and Chine&s;e players act dramatic pieces, written 1,000 years ago. Two &s;ongs have been pre&s;erved, which were compo&s;ed in the reign of Yao; one of which, for the antiquity's &s;ake, I will lay before my readers.</P>
<P><Q>When the &s;un begins its cour&s;e, I betake my&s;elf to work; and when he &s;inks below the horizon, I fall into the arms of &s;leep. I &s;lake my thir&s;t with water from my own well; and feed on the fruits of my own fields.&mdash;What, therefore, can I gain, or lo&s;e, by the power of the Emperor?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="189">The Chine&s;e tongue has no relation whatever with any known language; and, is &s;uch, that no laws of analogy can comprehend it. It has no alphabet; every word that compo&s;es it is a mono&s;yllable, and expre&s;&s;ed by a &s;ingle character: and, rich as this language is in expre&s;&s;ion, it has but 330 radical or primary words; but we &s;hall have a different notion of it, when we find that the &s;en&s;e of the&s;e primary words, may be multiplied, almo&s;t without end, by the variety of accents, inflections, a&s;pirations, and points, u&s;ed like the Hebrew, and by other changes of the voice. The&s;e accents, &s;o fugitive, are, however, very &s;en&s;ible to the ear of a Chine&s;e, who catches them very readily; as a Frenchman does <HI>l'eau, l'os, lots,</HI> which &s;trike the ears of an Engli&s;hman, or a German, with the &s;ame &s;ound.</P>
<P>The union and combination of the Chine&s;e mono&s;yllables is another cau&s;e of their great multiplication. By &s;uch a combination, a Chine&s;e can expre&s;s every thing. <HI>Mou,</HI> for example, &s;ignifies a <HI>tree,</HI> or <HI>wood;</HI> but, when joined to other words, acquires a new &s;en&s;e. Thus, <HI>mou-leao,</HI> implies, wood prepared for building; <HI>mou-lan,</HI> wooden bars; <HI>mou-hia,</HI> a box; <HI>mou-&s;iang,</HI> a pre&s;s; <HI>mou-t&s;iang,</HI> a carpenter; <HI>mou-eul,</HI> a mu&s;hroom; <HI>mou-nu,</HI> a kind of &s;mall orange; <HI>mou-&s;ing,</HI> the planet Jupiter; <HI>mou-mien,</HI> cotton, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Gai,</HI> implies love; <HI>je-gai,</HI> ardent love; <HI>t&s;e-gai,</HI> pa|rental love; <HI>king-gai,</HI> re&s;pectful love; <HI>ki-gai,</HI> blind love,
<PB N="182" REF="190">
&amp;c. in &s;hort, there are more than 100 different modifi|cations of this &s;ingle word <HI>gai.</HI> By this combination of words, the Chine&s;e have names for every thing that exi&s;ts, words that expre&s;s every circum&s;tance, or quality of a thing, and point out the &s;malle&s;t difference in that thing. Thus, in&s;tead of the&s;e &s;ix words, calf, heifer, &s;teer, cow, bull, ox, in Chine&s;e, they have not only the&s;e, but a multitude of others, which expre&s;s the dif|ferent years of their ages, their di&s;tinction, and the different varieties in colour, figure, and fruitfulne&s;s of the&s;e animals, and &s;o on.</P>
<P>This is quite &s;ufficient to give an idea of their lan|guage; to enter further into it, would require a &s;eparate work. As to the characters u&s;ed to expre&s;s the &s;everal words, there are more than eighty thou&s;and of them; and, the greater part of the <HI>literati,</HI> &s;pend their whole lives in learning them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> Of their Literature.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we view the immen&s;e number of libraries in China, elegantly built, beautifully adorned, and furni&s;hed with a valuable collection of books; when we con&s;ider the prodigious number of graduates, and colleges e&s;tabli&s;hed in every city throughout the empire; and when we further con&s;ider, that men are there never preferred, but in proportion to their literary talents; that the mo&s;t exalted &s;ituations are acquired only by &s;tudy; that none have been governors of cities and provinces, or have enjoyed offices about the court, but the learned, and that for upwards of 4,000 years: one would naturally imagine, that China mu&s;t be &s;uperior to every other country, in literature and learning.</P>
<P>This, however, is by no means the ca&s;e; for, though the Chine&s;e are allowed to have a great deal of know|ledge, that knowledge is not very intuitive, penetrating, or inventive; nor have any of the &s;peculative &s;ciences been brought to any perfection among&s;t them.</P>
<P>Logic, which in Europe is much refined, is void of all rules among the Chine&s;e. Their rhetoric is merely natural and imitative, having no method or art of embel|li&s;hing di&s;cour&s;e. Their eloquence does not con&s;i&s;t in an
<PB N="184" REF="192">
arrangement of periods, or an harmonious flow of words, but entirely in expre&s;&s;ions, bold metaphors, and a happy application of the maxims and &s;entences of their ancient &s;ages, who expre&s;s a variety of thoughts in a very few words. They never addre&s;s the Emperor, but in peti|tions, memorials, and remon&s;trances, which are void of every &s;uperfluous ornament, every u&s;ele&s;s expre&s;&s;ion, every weak argument, every ambiguous quotation, and every equivocal proof. "Study, day and night," &s;ays one of their be&s;t authors, <Q>to write ten characters of a remon|&s;trance, and of the&s;e era&s;e &s;ix. The thunderbolts of the throne fly in every direction; a &s;ingle &s;yllable is &s;uffi|cient to rou&s;e them; and they may carry death and de&s;truction to the remote&s;t corner of the empire.</Q></P>
<P>But, on particular occa&s;ions, &s;uch as academical di&s;|cour&s;es, written for degrees, &amp;c. they will vary their ge|neral mode, and &s;ometimes, to &s;hew their abilities, will di&s;play high-&s;ounding words, without meaning; thoughts which have more brilliancy than truth, embelli&s;hed with all the tin&s;el of Chine&s;e fancy; but &s;uch writers are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the names of <HI>kiu-keou, mou-ch&eacute;,</HI> golden mouths, and wooden tongues.</P>
<P>Chine&s;e rhetoricians reckon a great number of different kinds of eloquence; &s;o many, as to leave us a&s;toni&s;hed, at their having been able to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a variety of &s;hades in the art of per&s;uading. For the information
<PB N="185" REF="193">
of my readers, I will enumerate &s;ome few of the prin|cipal.</P>
<P>The force and ornament of truth, they call, <HI>the elo|quence of things.</HI></P>
<P>The emanation, or effu&s;ion of the orator's &s;oul, <HI>the eloquence of &s;entiment and conviction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The eloquence of candour and innocence,</HI> with them, is that which bani&s;hes doubt and &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P><HI>The eloquence of connexion and combination,</HI> is, the fruit of long &s;tudy and meditation.</P>

<P><HI>The eloquence of &s;ingularity and a&s;toni&s;hment,</HI> contradicts received truths, and &s;educes, by leading to di&s;coveries.</P>
<P><HI>The eloquence of illu&s;ion and artifice,</HI> effects a change, by diverting the attention; overpowers the heart, by a melting pathos.</P>
<P><HI>The eloquence of metaphy&s;ics and &s;ubtleties,</HI> is wrapt up in ob&s;curities, and impo&s;es on the weak, by confounding them with things pa&s;t comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>The eloquence of the old language,</HI> affects to imitate the tone of the ancients, and derives force from their au|thority.</P>
<P><HI>The eloquence of grandeur and maje&s;ty,</HI> ri&s;es, by the &s;trength of genius, to the &s;ublimity of the <HI>king</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A code of moral laws.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="194"><HI>The eloquence of images</HI> plea&s;es, like the flowers.</P>

<P><HI>The eloquence of &s;oftne&s;s and in&s;inuation</HI> is to the mind, what the light of the moon is to the eyes.</P>
<P><HI>The eloquence of depth</HI> is that which produces reflec|tion, by the extent, importance, and maje&s;ty of the truths, to the di&s;covery of which it appears only to conduct.</P>

<P>In &s;hort, the Chine&s;e have a &s;till greater variety; and have as many kinds of &s;tyle as of eloquence: but yet they &s;eem not fond of animated declamation, and, in their ora|tory, never u&s;e tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ive ge&s;tures, and that pow|erful modulation of voice, that captivates the eye and ear, and &s;o often contributes to the &s;ucce&s;s of our public di&s;|cour&s;es. They think, like the &s;avage <HI>Illinois,</HI> who were firmly per&s;waded that their mi&s;&s;ionary had fallen into a pa&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e he concluded his &s;ermon with a few pa|thetic &s;entences, delivered after the European manner. They labour to convince, by addre&s;&s;ing the under&s;tanding only. In &s;hort, a Chine&s;e orator, de&s;irous of making any impre&s;&s;ion on his hearers, endeavours to affect, little by little; and this is be&s;t brought about, by appearing to be really affected him&s;elf. "It is not by its cries," &s;ays a Chine&s;e writer, <Q>it is by its flight, that the wild duck
<PB N="187" REF="195">
makes the re&s;t depart, and guides them through the air.</Q></P>
<P>The knowledge of a&s;tronomy may be traced back, in China, even to the foundation of the empire. In the time of <HI>Yao,</HI> who&s;e reign began 2,357 years before the chri&s;|tian aera, they had mathematicians in China, who formed a calendar, by the Emperor's orders. They were then acquainted with the motion of the &s;un, moon, and planets; and their almanacks told the &s;ame things then, as ours do now. Their a&s;tronomical year began on the 21&s;t of De|cember, which is the winter &s;ol&s;tice; but their civil year, re&s;ted on the determination of the Emperor. Tho&s;e al|manacks, at pre&s;ent, made and publi&s;hed for the u&s;e of the people, are filled with &s;uper&s;titious predictions, and all the non&s;en&s;ical dreams of judicial a&s;trology.</P>
<P>At Peking there is e&s;tabli&s;hed a tribunal of a&s;tronomy, one of the mo&s;t important offices of which is, the ob&s;er|vation of eclip&s;es. They are to acquaint the Emperor of all the particulars, re&s;pecting the&s;e <HI>phenomena,</HI> &s;ome months before they happen; notice of which is tran&s;mitted, by him, into all the provinces of the empire. The ancient opinion of the Chine&s;e was, that during the time of an eclip&s;e of the &s;un or moon, they were attacked by a ce|le&s;tial dragon, as I have had occa&s;ion to mention before; and though the learned, and people of di&s;tinction, are now quite free from this ancient prejudice, and are per&s;waded that eclip&s;es are owing to natural cau&s;es, yet cu&s;tom has
<PB N="188" REF="196">
&s;uch a prevalence over them, that they will not leave off their ancient ceremonies, which are general throughout the empire.</P>
<P>On the day of the eclip&s;es, therefore, the mandarins of all the different orders, receive notice to appear in their proper dre&s;&s;es, and with all the badges of their dignity, in the court of the tribunal of a&s;tronomy, and there to wait till the eclip&s;e takes place. Each of them carries, in his hand, a &s;heet of the paper, which contains a figure of the eclip&s;e, and every circum&s;tance attending it. As &s;oon as they perceive the &s;un or moon begins to be darkened, they all throw them&s;elves on their knees, and knock their foreheads again&s;t the earth. A frightful noi&s;e of drums and cymbals immediately &s;ucceeds throughout the city; this being the remains of an ancient opinion, that, by &s;uch horrid din, they a&s;&s;i&s;ted the &s;uffering luminary, and pre|vented its being devoured by the dragon.</P>

<P>At Peking there is a very fine ob&s;ervatory, with noble in&s;truments and apparatus, fit for the ob&s;ervatory of a prince. The cele&s;tial globe is &s;ix feet in diameter, and though it weighs 2,000lb. is &s;o well hung, that any child may turn it.</P>
<P>They have no clocks, or watches, in China, but what are brought from Europe; but they have &s;un-dials, and reckon their time almo&s;t as we do. The hours of the day and night, in towns, are &s;ounded by bells, on which per&s;ons are &s;tationed to &s;trike.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="197">The calendar, or almanack, when made and publi&s;hed, is fir&s;t pre&s;ented to the Emperor. It is, by his order, then di&s;tributed to the princes, lords, and great officers in every province, and by them to all &s;ubordinate officers. This done, it is re-printed for the people; no other than this approved calendar can be printed, under pain of death. This pre&s;enting of the calendar to the Emperor, is annually made, with a great deal of ceremony. All the mandarins of Peking, appear early in the morning, at the palace, in their proper habits; and the calendars intended for the Emperor and Empre&s;s, are on large paper, covered with yellow &s;atin, and enclo&s;ed in cloth of gold. They are placed on a large gilded machine, in the form of a pyramid, and carried by 40 footmen, in yellow liveries. This is followed by 12 other &s;imilar ma|chines, of a &s;maller &s;ize, &s;urrounded with red curtains, on which are placed the calendars for the princes of the blood; the&s;e are bound in red &s;atin, and enclo&s;ed in cloth of &s;ilver. Immediately after follow &s;everal tables, covered with red carpets, on which are carried the calendars of the grandees, the generals of the army, and other officers of the crown, covered with yellow cloth.</P>
<P>The porters, who quit their loads at the la&s;t gate of the great hall, and place the tables on each &s;ide of the pa&s;|&s;age, leave nothing in the middle, but the machine that comes with the Imperial calendars, from which the man|darins take the calendars, and place them on a table, co|vered with yellow brocade, within the hall, pro&s;trating
<PB N="190" REF="198">
them&s;elves three times, and then delivering them to the intendants of the palace, for the Emperor.</P>
<P>Each prince &s;ends his chief officer to the Imperial pa|lace, where he receives, on his knees, the calendar for his Royal ma&s;ter, and tho&s;e for the mandarins of his hou&s;e|hold, which amount to 12 or 1300 for the court of every prince. Afterwards, the lords, and generals of the army, and the mandarins of all the tribunals, appear, and re|ceive, on their knees, a calendar each, from the a&s;trono|mical mandarins.</P>
<P>After this di&s;tribution, every one returns, in his rank, to the hall, and turning him&s;elf towards the mo&s;t inward part of the palace, at a &s;ignal given, falls on his knees, and bows three times to the ground. After three genu|flexions, and nine, profound reverences with the head, he returns to his own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Following the example of the court, the governors, and mandarins of the &s;everal provinces, receive the calendar in the &s;ame manner, in each capital city, according to their ranks. As for the people, there are none of them &s;o poor, but they will buy a calendar every year; &s;uch pur|cha&s;e being a declaration of loyalty to their Sovereign. A non-purcha&s;e would be looked on as an act of di&s;|affection.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="199">Though they are not ignorant of arithmetic, they add and &s;ubtract by means of an in&s;trument called <HI>Souan-Pan,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;mall board, cro&s;&s;ed from the top to the bottom, having 10 or 12 parallel wires, with a &s;epa|ration in the middle.

<P>They reckon much in the &s;ame manner, in joining and &s;eparating the balls, as we do with counters; but with &s;o much facility and quickne&s;s, that they can keep pace with a man, who is reading a book of accounts; and can ca&s;t up the mo&s;t con&s;iderable &s;ums, in le&s;s time than Europeans, with the u&s;e of figures.</P>

<P><PB N="193" REF="201">As we have &s;poken of their theatric repre&s;entations, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e they are acquainted with the drama. But they have no rules for dramatic compo&s;ition; nor do they make any di&s;tinction between tragedy and comedy. Each performer, when he enters, begins by telling his name, and the character he is going to &s;upport; and the &s;ame actor often performs &s;everal parts in one piece. Female parts are performed by boys.</P>
<P>Chine&s;e tragedies are inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;everal pieces of &s;inging. In tho&s;e parts, where the performer is &s;uppo&s;ed to be agitated mo&s;t, he breaks off his declamation, and begins to &s;ing, accompanied with in&s;truments.</P>
<P><HI>Voltaire</HI> borrowed the &s;ubject of his tragedy, which <HI>Murphy</HI> has &s;ince tran&s;lated, under the name of, <HI>The Or|phan of China,</HI> from a Chine&s;e tragedy, called, <HI>The Orphan of Tchao,</HI> which was tran&s;lated from the Chine&s;e by the mi&s;&s;ionary <HI>Premare,</HI> and which was among a hundred of the be&s;t theatrical pieces, compo&s;ed in the fourteenth century. But the Chine&s;e <HI>literati</HI> &s;eldom employ their talents in this &s;pecies of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Neither do they turn their thoughts to poetry; this &s;tudy being &s;eldom pur&s;ued but from ta&s;te, or to fill up a vacant hour. When a Chine&s;e, &s;peaking of a man of letters, &s;ays, he has a talent of making good ver&s;es, he means, to &s;peak of him as we would of a captain of dra|goons, by &s;aying, he is an excellent performer on the

violin. A ta&s;te for poetry is, however, pretty general in China; and their art in this polite literature, differs very little from the manner of <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Boileau.</HI> But as a Chine&s;e poet has not the &s;ame re&s;ources as Europeans, in the attracting fictions of ancient mythology, they &s;upply the deficiency, by bold and ingenious metaphors, and u&s;ing the names of &s;everal animals in an allegorical &s;en&s;e; thus &s;upplying the place of Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, &amp;c.

But, to give a clearer idea of their poetry, I will tran&s;cribe part of a poem, written by the Emperor <HI>Kien-long,</HI> who had been 50 years on the throne of China, and was one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed &s;cholars, and be&s;t poets of the age.

<P>Were we to credit the Chine&s;e, they were the fir&s;t in|ventors of mu&s;ic, and who formerly brought it to the greate&s;t perfection. If this be true, they are greatly de|generated; for with them it is, at pre&s;ent, &s;o imperfect, that it is unworthy the name. They &s;eem, however, to regret the lo&s;s of their ancient harmony, as we do that of the Greeks and Egyptians, which has been &s;o much ex|tolled
<PB N="197" REF="205">
by antiquity, and of which &s;o many wonderful things have been related.

<P>Father <HI>Amiot</HI> applyed him&s;elf, with the utmo&s;t &s;tudy, to learn the mu&s;ical &s;y&s;tem of the ancient Chine&s;e, and di&s;covered that, before <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> or even <HI>Mercury</HI> him|&s;elf, the divi&s;ion of the octave into 12 &s;emitones, was known in China; and that, from the remote&s;t ages of antiquity, they had, in their &s;cale, only five tones, cor|re&s;ponding to our <HI>fa, &s;ol, la, ut, re;</HI> and two others, an&s;wering to our <HI>mi</HI> and <HI>do;</HI> and he is of opinion that the Greeks, and <HI>Pythagoras</HI> him&s;elf, did nothing but apply that theory to &s;trings, which the Chine&s;e had before form|ed, and applied to pipes. But whether or not the Chi|ne&s;e have the honour of being the fir&s;t inventors, as I have &s;aid, they are now very much, in this &s;cience, below other nations. They are ignorant of mu&s;ical notes, and have no &s;igns to de&s;cribe the diver&s;ity of tones, the ri&s;ing or falling of the voice, and the re&s;t of tho&s;e variations that con&s;titute harmony. The airs which they &s;ing, or play,
<PB N="198" REF="206">
are only got by rote, and are learnt by the ear; notwith&s;tanding which, they frequently compo&s;e new ones.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic, with them, is &s;eldom heard, but at plays, fea&s;ts, weddings, and &s;uch like occa&s;ions. Their concerts have no dependance on the variety of tones, or difference of parts. They all &s;ing the &s;ame air, as is practi&s;ed throughout the other parts of A&s;ia. They have invented eight kinds of mu&s;ical in&s;truments, which they think have the neare&s;t re&s;emblance to a human voice: &s;ome are of &s;tone, others of metal, like our bells, and one among&s;t the re&s;t, is not unlike our trumpet. They have al&s;o others, made of &s;kins, like our drums. They likewi&s;e make u&s;e of &s;tringed in&s;truments, but the &s;trings are of &s;ilk; the&s;e are the cymbals that blind people play on: as al&s;o their violins, each of which has but three &s;trings. They have al&s;o wind-in&s;truments of two or three kinds, re&s;embling our flutes; and a &s;mall &s;pecies of organ, the &s;ound of which is not di&s;agreeable. But they are the only nation who have had the ingenuity to apply &s;tones to the making of mu&s;ical in&s;truments. I have already mention|ed their &s;onorous &s;tones, and the in&s;trument con&s;tructed of them is called a <HI>king,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of an a&s;&s;ortment of 16 &s;tones, formed like our carpenter's &s;quare, and &s;u&s;pended by the angles, as we now &s;u&s;pend our mu&s;ical bells; which &s;tones they &s;trike in the &s;ame manner.</P>

<P><PB N="199" REF="208">Their wind-in&s;truments are made with the bamboo, in a variety of forms, compo&s;ed of pipes, joined together, or &s;eparate, and pierced with holes, more or le&s;s. The principal wind-in&s;trument they have, is formed of a gourd, and a number of bamboo-pipes. The neck of the gourd being cut off, it is covered with a piece of wood, in which &s;everal holes, of different diameters, are bored; into each of the&s;e holes a bamboo-pipe, &s;horter or longer, is fixed, in order to vary the tones; and another pipe is, like the handle of a pipkin, introduced into the &s;ide, below the wood-cover; which, when applied to the mouth, conveys the air to all the pipes it contains. Father <HI>Pereira,</HI> who was a tolerable mu&s;ician, as the Emperor played an air, pricked it down in European notes, and immediately played it him&s;elf; which &s;o &s;truck the Emperor with a&s;toni&s;hment, that he could &s;carce believe his eyes and ears; not comprehending how a &s;tranger could learn a piece of mu&s;ic &s;o quickly, that had co&s;t &s;o much time and labour to his mu&s;icians to learn.</P>
<P>Having mentioned their mu&s;ic, I will &s;ay a few words of their painting, though not immediately connected with their literature; yet, if it be con&s;idered, that paint|ing &s;peaks to the eye as oratory paints to the ear, there is a great analogy between writing and painting.</P>

<P>Painting, however, makes but little progre&s;s in China; it is reckoned among the frivolous arts; but the Emperor's cabinets and galleries are filled with European paintings; and he has, in his park, a European village, painted in <HI>fre&s;co,</HI> which produces the mo&s;t agreeable deception.

This beautiful work is the production of Chine&s;e painters, from de&s;igns &s;ketched out for them. Indeed, <HI>fre&s;co</HI> painting was known in China long before the chri&s;tian aera.</P>
<P>Engraving, in a variety of colours, is very ancient among the Chine&s;e; but their &s;tatuary is nothing to &s;peak of.

<P>With re&s;pect to their architecture, indifferent as it is, it is not without its principles, its rules, and proportions; and, though it has no relation whatever to Eutopean ar|chitecture, nor has borrowed any thing from the Greeks, has a certain beauty peculiar to it&s;elf The man&s;ions of the Emperor are real palaces; and, by the immen&s;ity, &s;ymmetry, height, regularity and magnificence, of the numberle&s;s buildings which compo&s;e them, announce, in a &s;triking manner, the maje&s;ty and greatne&s;s of the ma&s;ter who inhabits them.

<P><PB N="202" REF="211">All the hou&s;es and buildings of China are of wood; not owing to a &s;carcity of &s;tone or marble, for they have &s;uch abundance of the latter, that many cities are paved with marble, of all colours; nor to the difficulty of tran&s;porting it, for all the Emperor's gardens are inter&s;per&s;ed with enormous, artificial rocks; the foundations of all his pa|laces, con&s;i&s;t of immen&s;e blocks both of marble and ala|ba&s;ter, and the &s;teps of all the &s;tairs, however high, or broad, are all of one piece. It is the dread of earthquakes that prevents their building with marble; and the great heat in the &s;outhern provinces, and extreme cold in the northern ones, making &s;uch marble &s;weat, would render hou&s;es built with it unwhole&s;ome, and almo&s;t uninhabit|able. During winter, at Peking, the cold is &s;o exceed|ingly &s;harp and &s;evere, that no window fronting the north can be opened, and water continues con&s;tantly frozen to the depth of 18 inches, for more than three months together.</P>

<P>Vital heat, and radical moi&s;ture, are, with them, the two natural principles of life; the blood and &s;pirits being only con&s;idered as their vehicles.

They found their mo&s;t infallible prog|no&s;tics,
<PB N="204" REF="213">
on a knowledge of the pul&s;e, the theory of which is very exten&s;ive. An ancient Chine&s;e phy&s;ician, has left a complete treati&s;e on this &s;ubject, written 200 years before the chri&s;tian aera; by which it appears, that the Chine&s;e were acquainted with the circulation of the blood, long before any European nation; but, not to take the merit from our countryman Mr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> this circulation, in its full round, might not have been di&s;covered before he found it out.</P>
<P>When a Chine&s;e phy&s;ician is &s;ent for, he places the patient's arm upon a pillow, applies his four fingers along the artery, &s;ometimes touching it gently, and &s;ometimes more forcibly, and after examining it for a con&s;iderable time, without a&s;king any que&s;tions, he will tell the pa|tient where he feels pain, what parts are attacked, and what are mo&s;t expo&s;ed to danger; he will al&s;o tell him in what manner, and in what time, his di&s;order will ter|minate.</P>
<P>Their phy&s;ic, however, is almo&s;t quackery. They have the greate&s;t confidence in their &s;imples, with which, and a few fruits, they compo&s;e the greater part of all their cordials. Gin&s;eng, of which I have &s;poken, is con&s;idered, with them, as a plant of the fir&s;t cla&s;s; and, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from all others, is called, <HI>The plant.</HI> It is prepared 77 different ways; which form as many different pre&s;crip|tions. It is a &s;carce root, was formerly &s;old for its weight
<PB N="205" REF="214">
in &s;ilver; and, at pre&s;ent, co&s;ts almo&s;t its weight in gold. They alllow tea to be a great and powerful medicine; but they recommend it to be u&s;ed moderately, never to be drank hotter than warm, and by no means on an empty &s;tomach.</P>
<P>I will conclude this chapter, with the method the Chine&s;e tribunals take, to di&s;cover whether a per&s;on has died a natural death, or in con&s;equence of &s;ome violence; and even after the body has began to putrify.</P>
<P>The body, being fir&s;t taken from the earth, is wa&s;hed in vinegar. After this, a large fire is kindled, in a pit dug on purpo&s;e, &s;ix feet long, three wide, and three deep; and this fire is continually augmented, till the &s;urrounding earth is as hot as an oven. The remaining fire is then taken from the pit, a large quantity of wine poured into it, and it is covered with a hurdle, made of o&s;ier twigs, on which the body is &s;tretched at full length. A cloth is thrown over both, in the form of an arch, in order that the &s;team of the wine may act upon it in every direction. At the end of two hours, this cloth is taken off, and, if any blows has been given, they will appear upon the body, in whatever &s;tate it may be. The &s;ame experiment is even extended to bones, &s;tripped of their fle&s;h. The Chine&s;e a&s;&s;ure us, that if the blows given, have been &s;o &s;evere as to occa&s;ion death, this experiment makes the marks appear upon the bones, though none of them may be broken, or injured.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="215">We mu&s;t here remark, that the wine mentioned, is a kind of beer, made from rice and honey.&mdash;A nece&s;&s;ary ob&s;ervation, &s;hould any one in Europe make an attempt to prove the truth of the expedient, which de&s;erves &s;o much to be verified; as, in certain criminal ca&s;es, it may tend to clear up doubts, and exculpate innocence.</P>

<HEAD>Of other Nations &s;ubject to the CHINESE. From <HI>Dampier, Tavernier,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> Of the Kingdom of Tonquin.</HEAD>
<P>BESIDES the Tartars in the north, and bordering upon the Ru&s;&s;ian territories, whom I have already de&s;cribed; they have &s;ome mountaineers on the back, or we&s;tern provinces of China, &s;ubjects to the empire: the&s;e are the <HI>Si-fans,</HI> the <HI>Lo-los,</HI> and the <HI>Miao-t&s;e.</HI> The fir&s;t inhabit the provinces of Chen-&s;i and Se-tchuen; the &s;econd, are di&s;per&s;ed throughout the province of Yun-nan; and the latter, the mountains throughout the pro|vinces of Se-tchuen, Koei-tcheou, Hou-quang, Quang-&s;i, and on the frontiers of the province of Quang-tong.</P>
<P>The Si-fans live together, in &s;mall bodies, &s;ubject to families; the olde&s;t of which becomes a Lama, who has
<PB N="208" REF="217">
the power of trying cau&s;es, and puni&s;hing criminals. The greater part live in tents, forming &s;mall hamlets, of five or &s;ix families each. They keep large flocks, and are in want of none of the nece&s;&s;aries of life. They are of a proud and independent &s;pirit, and &s;ubmit to the Chine&s;e with reluctance. When &s;ummoned by the mandarins, they rarely appear, but government winks at their con|tempt, for political rea&s;ons, and endeavours to keep them in &s;ubjection, by mildne&s;s and moderation. Indeed, it would be difficult to reduce them, as their wild and frightful mountains, covered with &s;now, even in July, would afford them &s;helter, from which they could not be driven.</P>
<P>The Lo-los were formerly governed by their own &s;o|vereigns, but &s;ubmitted to the Emperor of China, on condition of enjoying for ever, the honours of Chine&s;e mandarins. The&s;e have a language of their own; their princes are ab&s;olute ma&s;ters of their &s;ubjects, and can puni&s;h with death; and have an army, of hor&s;e and foot.</P>
<P>The Miao-t&s;e are al&s;o under the government of princes, no le&s;s ab&s;olute than tho&s;e of the Lo-los, and have a re|gular militia, maintained by feudatory lords. Their arms are, bows and half-pikes; and their hor&s;es, wonderfully expert and active. When officers are cho&s;en among them, the candidates are obliged to ride, full &s;peed, down the &s;teepe&s;t declivities, and to clear, at one leap, very wide
<PB N="209" REF="218">
ditches, in which large fires are kindled. The&s;e hor&s;es are much valued in China, are very &s;carce, and fetch a very great price.</P>
<P>The Miao-t&s;e are collected into villages, and live in great harmony. They employ them&s;elves in hu&s;bandry, weave a coar&s;e, mu&s;lin cloth, and a kind of carpets. Their dre&s;s is a pair of drawers, and a jacket, which laps over the brea&s;t, but they go bare-footed. The head-dre&s;s of their women is whim&s;ical. They place, upon their heads, horizontally, a piece of board, about a foot long, and &s;ix inches broad; over which they &s;pread their hair, and fix it to the wood, with wax. The Miao-t&s;e ladies con&s;ider this as elegant, not perceiving the re&s;traint to which it &s;ubjects the wearer; for they cannot lie down, without &s;omething to &s;upport their necks; and cannot make their way through their bu&s;hy country, but by turning their heads every moment. When they comb their hair, which they do three or four times a year, they are obliged to re|main &s;ome hours before a large fire, to melt the wax, and make it run off; but, after they have combed it, they dre&s;s it again, in the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e entertain the mo&s;t &s;overeign contempt for this nation; and they, in their turn, de&s;pi&s;e the Chine&s;e: however, at the lo&s;s of a great number of men, the Chine&s;e made a complete conque&s;t of them, in 1776.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="219">There are al&s;o two or three large &s;tates, tributary to China, that I mu&s;t mention. Korea, Tonquin, and Cochin-China. I will &s;peak of each in their turn.</P>
<P>Korea, which the Chine&s;e call <HI>Kao-li,</HI> is a large penin|&s;ula, extending between China and Japan; 200 leagues long, from north to &s;outh, and 100 broad, from ea&s;t to we&s;t. It's di&s;tance, from Japan, is only 25 leagues. This kingdom is governed by a &s;overeign, who, though tributary to China, exerci&s;es ab&s;olute authority over his &s;ubjects. He is ma&s;ter of all their wealth, and inherits it, after their death; and, every &s;eventh year, all the freemen of the different provinces, are obliged to go to court, in rotation, and keep guard round the monarch, for two months; &s;o that, during this year, all Korea is in mo|tion, and under arms.</P>
<P>They differ &s;o little from the Chine&s;e, in their per&s;ons, cu&s;toms and manners, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary to dwell upon the &s;ubject. Their women, indeed, are le&s;s confined; and, in matrimony, young folks choo&s;e for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Tonquin, and Cochin-China, formerly compo&s;ed one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive provinces in China. Three hund|red years before the chri&s;tian aera, they were inhabited by &s;avages; but, being conquered by China, 214 before Chri&s;t, the Emperor &s;ent here 500,000 per&s;ons, from different parts of the Empire, filled the&s;e two kingdoms with Chine&s;e families, and cau&s;ed two brazen pillars to be
<PB N="211" REF="220">
erected on the boundaries, between Tonquin and the pro|vince of Quang-&s;i, which are &s;tanding to this day. The&s;e columns have the following in&s;cription: <Q>When the&s;e pillars &s;hall be de&s;troyed, Tonquin &s;hall peri&s;h.</Q> The Tonquine&s;e, at pre&s;ent, con&s;ider this in&s;cription as a pro|phecy, and the&s;e columns as monuments, on which the fate of their kingdom hangs; of cour&s;e, take great care to pre&s;erve them, by &s;heltering them from the weather.</P>
<P>Tonquin extends between the 17th and 23d degrees of N. latitude, bounded on the north, by the Chine&s;e pro|vinces of Yun-nan and Quang-&s;i; on the ea&s;t, by the province of Canton, and the &s;ea; on the &s;outh, by the &s;ea, and Cochin-China; and, on the we&s;t, by the coun|try of Laos. The capital city is Cachao. Tonquin has a king of its own, tributary to China, and is divided into eight provinces, under as many governors. The king's guards con&s;i&s;t of 2,000 &s;oldiers; and about 20,000 more are &s;tationed on the frontiers. On all the rivers of the kingdom, where it is probable an enemy might invade, are kept 100 large gallies, and a great number of galiots, in which the &s;ailors row, &s;tanding. This country is health|ful and plea&s;ant in dry &s;ea&s;ons; but, from April to Augu&s;t, the wet &s;ea&s;on holds, and the lands are annually flooded, as in all countries between the tropics, at this time of the year. This is the cau&s;e of the Nile's overflowing in Egypt. Between the beginning of Augu&s;t, and the latter end of October, happen tho&s;e violent &s;torms, called Tuffoons,
<PB N="212" REF="221">
or <HI>Typhones,</HI> which are &s;o furious, that the Chine&s;e dare not &s;tir from their harbours.</P>
<P>In the woody, mountainous part of this country, are found elephants of an extraordinary &s;ize. Five hundred of them are kept for the king's u&s;e in war. Hor&s;es they have not many, but cows and buffaloes in plenty; with the la&s;t, they plow their land. They have neither lions, a&s;&s;es, nor &s;heep, except &s;ome few of the la&s;t, kept by the king; but they have abundance of &s;tags, bears, tygers, and rhi|nocero&s;es. Apes here are remarkable for their &s;ize and boldne&s;s. They will enter a plantation in troops, of two or three hundred together, eat what they can, afterwards roll large wi&s;ps of &s;traw round their wai&s;ts, fill tho&s;e wi&s;ps with rice, and march off in &s;ight of the pea&s;ants, who dare not attack them. Their dogs will catch rats and mice; and their vigilant ones, will watch all night for them, like our cats. They have great plenty of fowls, both wild and tame, but very few, &s;mall birds.</P>
<P>Among the latter, however, they have a &s;pecies of goldfinch, which &s;ings &s;o melodiou&s;ly, that they call it the <HI>cele&s;tial bird.</HI> Its eyes &s;parkle, like the mo&s;t bril|liant ruby; it has a round, &s;harp bill, an azure ring round its neck, and a &s;mall tuft of parti-coloured feathers on its head. When perched, its wings appear variegated with beautiful &s;hades of blue, green, and yellow; but, when it flies, they lo&s;e all their colours. In wet weather, it con|ceals it&s;elf in the thicke&s;t woods; but it comes forth when
<PB N="213" REF="222">
the &s;un &s;hines, as the harbinger of fair weather. This bird is &s;aid to be an enemy to another &s;ingular bird of this country, found in mar&s;hes, and called <HI>Ho-kien,</HI> which it no &s;ooner &s;ees, than it appears &s;truck with terror, mixed with fury. It's neck-feathers &s;tand erect, it extends and agitates its wings, opens its bill, hi&s;&s;es like a &s;erpent, and its attitude is that of a bird ready to dart on its prey, with|out offering to attack. It contents it&s;elf with looking on it's enemy with a fixed and di&s;ordered eye, as if it felt an inferiority of &s;trength.</P>
<P>The wings, back and tail, of the Ho-kien, are of a dazzling white; it's head is covered with a reddi&s;h down, and its belly is a bright yellow, &s;peckled with grey and black: it is about the &s;ize of a quail, and breeds only once a year. They have al&s;o a &s;ort of locu&s;ts, about as big as a man's finger, which breed in ditches and the banks of rivers, and are e&s;teemed good food by the na|tives. There are here great &s;warms of gnats and ants; the latter of which are &s;o mi&s;chievous, that, <HI>Tavernier</HI> &s;ays, they will eat through a bale of &s;ilk in 24 hours, and it will look, as if it had been &s;awn a&s;under.</P>
<P>They have gold and &s;ilver mines in this country, but never open them. The &s;oil, in general, is fertile; they grow a great quantity of rice, and cultivate it in the &s;ame manner as on the coa&s;t of Coromandel, flowing their land with water, and, when the plants are five or &s;ix inches high, tran&s;planting them into other grounds. Their
<PB N="214" REF="223">
next important object of cultivation, is the &s;ugar-cane, of which they have two kinds; and its proce&s;s of culture, is as follows.</P>
<P>Having turned up the earth, to the depth of two feet, they plant two or three cane-&s;hoots, a little inclined, and almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner as vines are planted in Italy, &s;inking the&s;e &s;lips 18 inches in the earth, and planting them checquer-wi&s;e, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix feet: this is done at the end of the rainy &s;ea&s;on. Twelve or fifteen months after, it is fit to be cut; when the juice is pre&s;&s;ed out, and boiled for &s;everal hours, to evaporate part of its water. In this &s;tate, it is carried to market, and looks like pure water. The merchants who purcha&s;e it, boil it again, with &s;ome alkaline &s;ub&s;tance, &s;uch as a&s;hes of <HI>Mu&s;a</HI> leaves, or calcined &s;hells, which produce a great froth. This is &s;kimmed off, and, by force of boiling, the alkali &s;eparates the &s;ugar from the water, and the juice is reduced to the con&s;i&s;tency of &s;yrup, which, when it begins to granulate, is poured into a large ve&s;&s;el, and left to cool. This &s;yrup is &s;oon covered with a thin, yel|low, &s;oft cru&s;t, and is then poured into ve&s;&s;els, like funnels. After it has &s;tood, and acquired the appearance of &s;alt, it is bleached and fini&s;hed in the &s;ame manner as in our We&s;t-Indian i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The Tonquine&s;e have but few, good fruits, and no &s;weet-&s;cented garden-flowers. Their be&s;t fruits are, pine-ap|ples, oranges, a kind of red fig, and a fig like tho&s;e of
<PB N="215" REF="224">
Provence in ta&s;te and figure, that does not grow on the branches of the tree, but &s;prings from its root, and, in &s;uch quantities, that 20 men may &s;atisfy their hunger with them. They cultivate the mulberry and varni&s;h-tree, cotton, tea, indigo, &s;affron, and pepper, but neglect the vine; and they have a large tree, that bears neither leaves nor fruit. They have another curious tree, the branches of which bend naturally down, &s;trike root, and &s;pring up again into other trees, who&s;e branches do the &s;ame; &s;o that one of the&s;e trees will, in cour&s;e of time, extend it|&s;elf a great way round. In their gardens they have yams, potatoes, and onions; and the betel leaf, which is &s;o much valued over all India, is very common in this country.</P>
<P>Having a very large &s;ea-coa&s;t, and many fine rivers, well &s;tocked with fi&s;h; their fi&s;heries employ a great number of hands; and many of them live, with their whole families, upon the water. Sea-turtles are very plentiful on their &s;hores.</P>
<P>The bay of Tonquin, by which Europeans approach this kingdom, is about 30 leagues wide, in the broade&s;t place, has about 46 fathom water, and a good anchorage every where. European &s;hips pa&s;s up the river Domea to Cachao, where the Engli&s;h and Dutch Ea&s;t-India com|panies have each of them a factory. This city lies about 100 miles up the river, and 80 from the places where their &s;hips anchor. There is a delightful pro&s;pect all the
<PB N="216" REF="225">
way up the river, of a large, level, fruitful country, con|&s;i&s;ting of pa&s;ture and rice-grounds, but no trees, ex|cept about their villages, which are &s;urrounded with them.</P>
<P>Cachao &s;tands on the river Domea, on a ri&s;ing ground, but without either bank, wall, or ditch to defend it. It con&s;i&s;ts of about 20,000 low-built hou&s;es, with mud-walls and thatched roofs, except the Engli&s;h and Dutch facto|ries, which are ordinary, low, brick hou&s;es. The chief &s;treets are very wide, but ill paved, and are dirty, in wet weather; and there are &s;everal ponds and ditches full of black mud, which, in dry &s;ea&s;ons, are very offen&s;ive, but yet the town is healthy. Every family has, in their back yard, an arched, brick building, like an oven, about &s;ix feet high, to &s;ecure his be&s;t goods, in ca&s;e of fire, to which thatched buildings are very liable; but government, by way of prevention, obliges every man to keep a great jar of water on the top of his hou&s;e, with buckets; and, if the fire cannot be extingui&s;hed this way, the thatch is &s;o contrived, in large pieces, or frames, of &s;even or eight feet &s;quare, to be thrown off at once; and they keep hooks, like our firemen, to pull down the buildings that are in flames.</P>
<P>There are three palaces in Cachao, in the chief of which the <HI>Boua,</HI> or king, re&s;ides. It is three leagues in cir|cumference, and has a wall about 15 feet high, faced on both &s;ides with brick; and within the palace, be&s;ides the
<PB N="217" REF="226">
buildings and apartments, there are parks, gardens, and canals, as in the royal palaces of China. In one of the other palaces, the general re&s;ides: before this is a parade, where the &s;oldiers are exerci&s;ed. Oppo&s;ite to this is an|other, low building, where the artillery is kept, which con&s;i&s;ts of about 50 or 60 iron guns, two or three whole culverins, and &s;ome iron mortars; but the carriages are generally out of repair. Near this palace, is a &s;table for 200 elephants, kept for war.</P>
<P>There are but few cities in Tonquin, be&s;ides Cachao. Hean is one of the principal, which has about 2,000 hou&s;es. Market-towns they have none; but every five or &s;ix villages take it by turns to have the market held in one of them. The&s;e &s;tand very thick all over the country, in flat &s;pots, and con&s;i&s;t of 30 or 40 hou&s;es, always &s;ur|rounded by groves of trees, and encompa&s;&s;ed by large moats and banks, thrown up beyond the groves, to pre|vent the hou&s;es and gardens being overflown in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, for all the land about them lies there two or three feet deep in water, and they are forced either to wade through it, from one village to another, or go in boats.</P>
<P>The partitions, in their hou&s;es, are made with &s;plit cane; and their rooms have no other light, than what they receive from a little, &s;quare hole. Their furniture con&s;i&s;ts of tables, &s;tools, and an ordinary bed or two, in their innermo&s;t rooms. Every hou&s;e has a little altar,
<PB N="218" REF="227">
with an image or two, and incen&s;e put upon it. They dre&s;s their meat u&s;ually in their yards, in fair weather; and within doors, in wet; but the rooms having no chimnies, they are, at &s;uch times, almo&s;t &s;uffocated with &s;moke.</P>
<P>The Tonquine&s;e are neither &s;o flat-no&s;ed, nor &s;o broad-vi&s;aged, as the Chine&s;e. Their complexion is olive; they are clean-made, &s;trong-limbed, and of a middle &s;tature; have long, black, lank hair, which grows very thick, and hangs down over their &s;houlders. They &s;uffer their nails to grow, as do the Chine&s;e; and, when they are about 12 or 13 years of age, dye their teeth black, which operation takes up three or four days; dur|ing which, the compo&s;ition being &s;o nau&s;eous, they &s;carce take any nouri&s;hment. They are ingenious, and, in di&s;|po&s;ition, free and open; though cheating, among them, when done with addre&s;s, is con&s;idered as a piece of pru|dence and &s;kill. They are generous, but their gene|ro&s;ity being regulated only by their intere&s;t, they never give, where there is no expectation of a return; of cour&s;e, le&s;t they &s;hould be importuned, take great care to conceal their wealth; and yet are lavi&s;h in their public expences, e&s;pecially in fea&s;ts, marriages, and funerals. They hate the Europeans, and take great plea&s;ure in over|reaching them.</P>
<P>The different &s;exes are not di&s;tingui&s;hable by their dre&s;s. The outward habit is a long gown, tied round the
<PB N="219" REF="228">
wai&s;t with a &s;a&s;h. Per&s;ons of di&s;tinction wear &s;ilk; but they never think them&s;elves finer, than when cloathed in red, or green, Engli&s;h broad-cloth; and wear caps of the &s;ame &s;tuff with their gowns. Inferior people, and &s;ol|diers, wear cotton cloth, dyed of a dark colour; and a &s;oldier's upper-garment reaches no lower than his knees: but they have drawers, or trow&s;ers, that come down to the middle of the leg. The very poor &s;carce wear any thing but a doublet, and a pair of drawers, without either &s;hirt, &s;hoes, or &s;tockings; and &s;it cro&s;s-legged on benches, rai&s;ed about a foot high, and covered with mats, all round the rooms where they make their entertainments, after the manner of the A&s;iaticks. But they place a cu&s;hion for their friends to &s;it on, another at their backs, and place a kind of umbrella, or alcove, over their heads.</P>
<P>From a barbarous per&s;wa&s;ion, that they have a power of di&s;po&s;ing of their own lives, and tho&s;e that belong to them, the Tonquine&s;e, &s;ays the Reverend <HI>Mr. Ovington,</HI> in his <HI>Voyage to Surat,</HI> poi&s;on, each year, one of the fruits of the Araguer, and give it to a child to eat, conceiving, that by the death of an innocent child, they &s;hall thrive the better the &s;ucceeding year.</P>
<P>One part of the year all the people are &s;laves; for, ex|cept the citizens of the capital, all the trade&s;men, joiners, &s;miths, ma&s;ons, carpenters, &amp;c. are obliged to work three months in the palace, and two or three for the man|darins
<PB N="220" REF="229">
and great lords: the re&s;t of the year they act as they plea&s;e. They have al&s;o particularities in their food. They eat buffaloes, dogs, cats, locu&s;ts, hor&s;e-fle&s;h, which they e&s;teem equal to beef, and the fle&s;h of the elephants that die a natural death. The trunk is often made a pre|&s;ent of to &s;ome great mandarin, as a delicacy. Frogs are another great di&s;h with them. Bullocks they &s;inge like bacon-hogs; and having &s;teeped &s;lices of raw beef in vi|negar for three or four hours, will eat it with a particular gu&s;t. Small fi&s;h and &s;hrimps they throw into a jar of &s;alted water, made very weak, which, after &s;ome little time, is reduced to a pulp. They u&s;e this as we do foy, and think it equally good, and often eat it with rice; but people of quality are &s;eldom without fle&s;h, fi&s;h and fowl, at their tables every day. Their meat is &s;erved up in &s;mall plates of lacquered wood, and being cut into little, &s;quare pieces, they eat it, as do the Chine&s;e, with chop&s;ticks. They al&s;o &s;alt their eggs, in the manner I have mentioned; and putting them in an earthen pot, clo&s;e &s;topped, they will keep for years.</P>
<P>Their u&s;ual liquor is tea, &s;old by women in the mar|ket-places; and they have al&s;o arrack, but of the wor&s;t kind, in which they infu&s;e &s;nakes and &s;corpions, and con|&s;ider it thus, as an antidote again&s;t poi&s;on.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Horta</HI> gives us &s;ome very intere&s;ting details, re&s;|pecting the ceremonies the Tonquine&s;e u&s;e, in their vi&s;its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> entertainments. The per&s;on who pays the vi&s;it, &s;tops
<PB N="221" REF="230">
at the gate, and gives the porter a few, loo&s;e leaves of paper, containing about eight or ten pages, on which are written, in large characters, his name and titles, together with the intention of his vi&s;it. The&s;e leaves are white, covered with red paper; but they have them of different colours, according to the rank of the per&s;on whom they vi&s;it. If the ma&s;ter is out, the paper is left, and the vi&s;it paid; if he is at home, the vi&s;it is conducted as I have de&s;cribed in China, with all their ceremonies and cu&s;toms, not omitting the comedies. Their cards of invitation run thus, the following being one that <HI>Horta</HI> copied:&mdash; <Q>Chao-ting has prepared a repa&s;t of &s;ome herbs, clean|ed his gla&s;&s;es, and arranged his hou&s;e, in order that Se-tong may come, and entertain him, with the charms of his conver&s;ation, and the eloquence of his learning; he therefore begs he will not refu&s;e him that divine plea&s;ure.</Q>&mdash;But the fir&s;t thing they entertain with, is betel and arak. They wrap up &s;everal &s;lices of the arak-nut in a betel-leaf, and daub it over with mortar, made of lime; and &s;trangers, on a vi&s;it, are offered &s;ome of this to chew, the per&s;on giving it with the right hand from a box which every man, like a &s;nuff-box, carries about him. I particularly mentioned the right-hand, as the left is only u&s;ed for the wor&s;t of offices; nor can a man be more unfortunate, than to be found left-handed among this people, or, indeed, in any part of India. The betel and arak, which they eat is a kind of opiate, which lulls peo|ple that u&s;e it into a plea&s;ing dream, and it gives a red colour to the lips. It makes the chewer &s;pit; but the

<P>Having a number of rivers, there is good travel|ing by water; and their highways and bridges are kept in good order; and tho' they have no public inns, yet, a traveller is &s;ure to meet, by the way-&s;ide, with fire, water and other conveniences to dre&s;s his food, and refre&s;h him&s;elf. The baggage in time of war, is carried by elephants; and, in the upland countries, they probably u&s;e porters, as does the Chine&s;e, for they have but few bea&s;ts of burden.</P>
<P>Wives are purcha&s;ed here as in China, and the peo|ple are not &s;tinted to any number; and in time of &s;carcity, they will &s;ell their wives and children for provi&s;ion. <HI>Dempier</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that men of the fir&s;t quality will offer their daughters to the merchants, and other officers, who come to trade there, though they know their &s;tay will be but a few months; and this with the hopes of mending the breed, and that their po&s;terity may be of a whiter ca&s;t then them&s;elves. Be&s;ides the women think this as lawful a way of get|ting money as any other, and &s;ome of them will lay up fortunes by it; and, if they &s;hould breed very fa&s;t, they have the liberty of &s;elling their children. The Dutch, who have frequently been here, contract a tem|porary marriage with the women of this country, and

make them their factors, to buy up &s;ilk, and mate|rials at the dead time of the year, and employ the poor when work is cheape&s;t; &s;o as to be ready by the arrival of their &s;hips. Many of the Dutch have rai&s;ed good fortunes by the&s;e female factors, who are faithful to them; and the women have al&s;o enriched them&s;elves, and been matches afterwards for the be&s;t lords of the country, when their Dutch hu&s;bands have di&s;continued trading, and left them. The &s;eamen al&s;o are very intimate with the natives, who teach them the art of gardening, and live here with their new accu&s;tomed wives, as if they were at home. The law grants a divorce to the man, but denies it to the woman; and in &s;uch ca&s;e, the children remain with the father. All the ceremony of divorces is the tak|ing a chop&s;tick of the hu&s;bands, and another of the wife's, and breaking them in half; one part of each is given to the man to keep, and the other to the wo|man. If a woman is convicted of adultery, &s;he is thrown to an elephant, who is trained up for the&s;e executions. The bea&s;t having to&s;&s;ed her up in the air, tramples her to pieces, when &s;he falls to the ground.</P>
<P>The favourite diver&s;ions of the Tonquine&s;e are co|medies; which they generally act at night, and accom|pany with abundance of machinery and decorations. They excel particularly in the repre&s;entation of torrents, rivers, &s;eas, tempe&s;ts and naval-battles.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="234">There are no common burial-places in Tonquin; every one is buried in his own ground; and within a month afterwards, a great fea&s;t is made at his grave, at which the prie&s;t, by his office, a&s;&s;i&s;ts. Over the graves of the opulent a tower of wood is built, &s;even or eight feet &s;quare, and above five and twenty feet high, which the prie&s;t a&s;cends, and makes a &s;peech from the top, then comes down, and the building in &s;et on fire, which being &s;lightly built with painted boards, is &s;oon con&s;umed; after which the people proceed to rejoicing and are very merry. On the death of a monarch, <HI>Tavernier</HI> &s;ays, the mandarins wear mourning for three years, tho&s;e of the hou&s;hold for nine months, the nobility &s;ix, and the common people three months; but, there are no public amu&s;ements for three years, except at the coronation of the &s;ucceeding king.</P>
<P>This government is one of the &s;trange&s;t we have heard of. The rightful prince enjoys little more than the empty title of king; the general or prime mini&s;|ter being ma&s;ter of all the trea&s;ure and forces of the kingdom, and to whom all men pay their court. This is a u&s;urped power of the general's, which he keeps up, having near 100,000 men at his command; and keeps the real king, as it were, a pri&s;oner in his own palace. Soldiers are here taught to make their own gunpowder in little hand-mills. Every one has a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">touch box, their guns have matchlocks, and no people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and fire quicker.

very bright, and cover them with lacquered cane in bad weather. They pick their men by their appe|tites, and the general's guard con&s;i&s;ts of the be&s;t eaters: the greate&s;t part of their forces are kept on the fron|tiers of Cochin-China, and between the outguards of each kingdom, they have frequent &s;kirmi&s;hes, but the&s;e &s;eldom come to a general engagement. The army never takes the field, or encamps, but in the dry &s;ea|&s;on. When it marches, the guards and principal officers are mounted upon elephants, in little wooden apart|ments. They carry no artillery with them, but &s;ome long guns, which they re&s;t on forks to fire, and which they u&s;e, to clear a pa&s;s, or fire acro&s;s a river. Their naval force is but &s;mall; con&s;i&s;ting only of gallies 60 or 70 feet long, and very narrow; the head and &s;tern rai&s;ed 10 or 12 feet above the water, but in the middle not more than two. The captain &s;its in the &s;tern, which is finely painted and gilded; and the &s;ol|diers, who are always the rowers, have an awning over them to keep them dry. They pu&s;h their oars from them and plunge them all into the water, at once, according to a &s;ignal given. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els do not draw above two feet and a half water, and cannot be u&s;ed at &s;ea, but in calm weather. They employ their &s;oldiers to prevent &s;muggling, and the&s;e al&s;o keep watch in the towns at night, but are then only armed with long &s;taves, yet yet are in&s;olent and trouble&s;ome to all that pa&s;s them, and their officers to whom only they are accountable, are not very ready to receive complaints.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="236">There are no courts of judicature, but any &s;ingle magi&s;trate can puni&s;h, agreeable to the laws, and with|out appeal; &s;entence being executed immediately. Murder and capital offences are puni&s;hed by beheading before the offender's own door, or where the fact was committed. The criminal is &s;et on the ground, and his head is taken off at one blow, by a back-&s;word. Theft is puni&s;hed by mutilation, or cutting off the the joint of a finger, a whole finger, or the whole hand, according to the degree of offence. Adultery, as I ob&s;erved before, by throwing the adultere&s;s to an Elephant. For le&s;&s;er offences, the wooden collar, and bamboo are u&s;ed, as in China. And for debt, the debtor is condemned, to become a pri&s;oner to his creditor, and work for him, till the debt is paid.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of their magi&s;trates are eunuchs. Each governor is ab&s;olute in his province; and when a eunuch-manda|rin dies, his effects are the property of government; on which account, their extortions are winked at. The mandarins, tho' eunuchs, will keep young wenches to play with, and will often recommend their girls to Europeans who trade there, and take their acceptance of them kindly.</P>

<P>This country produces great quantities of &s;ilk, &s;uch as pelongs, &s;oo&s;ees, hawkins, penia&s;coes and gau&s;e, the two latter are &s;ometimes plain, and &s;ometimes flowered. The lacquered ware is another great ma|nufacture in this kingdom, and, next to that of Japan, e&s;teemed the be&s;t in the world. The excellence does not &s;o much con&s;i&s;t in the paint and varni&s;h, as in the wood, which is a kind of fir. The different coats of varni&s;h, are laid on, in fine weather, one after another, as they dry; and after the outer coat is dry, it is poli&s;hed by rubbing. This country is famous al&s;o for <HI>Lignum Aloes. Tavernier</HI> tells us, there is &s;o great a difference in the goodne&s;s of this wood, that it may be had, from three crowns to a thou&s;and. If it be clo&s;e and oily, a piece, the &s;ize of a pea, thrown into the fire, will perfume a room; as much as a dry piece, as large as a man's fi&s;t.</P>
<P>The Tonquine&s;e make no long voyages, nor export any merchandize in their own bottoms, except fi&s;h and rice, to &s;ome neighbouring countries. They deal much fairer than the Chine&s;e, and perform their contracts punctually: only that the merchant is forced to wait &s;everal months for the making of his goods. They are pretty, good mechanicks, and have almo&s;t all kinds of handicrafts among them. Money chang|ing

<P>Learning in Tonquin, is on a par with that of China; the Tonquine&s;e apply to letters from emula|tions, as they open the way to honour, and they cannot be promoted to offices of dignity, but in proportion to their abilities. Degrees in literature are conferred by the monarch, after a public examination in the palace court-yard, before the king and all the grandees of the &s;tate. Their language is a kind of guttural Chine&s;e.</P>
<P>Their phy&s;icians &s;tudy little but the nature of &s;imples, and the doctrine of the pul&s;e; by which like the Chine&s;e, they pretend to di&s;cern the cau&s;e and &s;eat of every di&s;order. The purple fever, a di&s;order very dangerous in Europe, is here thought little of; they treat it as follows. Taking the pith of a certain reed, they dip it in oil, and apply it to all the purple &s;pots, on the body, one after another: the fle&s;h then bur&s;ts, with a report as loud as a pi&s;tol, and after the corrupted blood has been &s;queezed out, they compleat the cure, by rubbing the wounds with ginger. This remedy mu&s;t be painful, but we are a&s;&s;ured that its efficacy is certain.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="239">Per&s;ons are often bit here by &s;erpents; but the cure is at hand. They have a &s;mall &s;tone much re&s;embling a che&s;nut, the virtue of which is almo&s;t miraculous. It is called the <HI>Serpent-&s;tone.</HI> When any one has been bit by a venemous reptile, the blood is pre&s;&s;ed out, and this healing &s;tone applied to the wound, where it adheres, and gradually &s;ucks out the poi&s;on. When impregnated with the poi&s;on it drops off, like a leech when full. It is then care|fully wa&s;hed with milk and water, in which lime has been diluted, and applied to the wound a &s;econd time where it &s;ticks, till it has exhaled all the virus. In le&s;s than an hour, the patient finds him&s;elf without fever, or any kind of pain.</P>
<P>Bleeding is the phy&s;ician's la&s;t re&s;ource; but to purify the blood, they u&s;e the powder of a crab, found on the &s;hores here, often in a &s;tate of petrifac|tion; and which they reduce to powder, and admini&s;ter it internally, in water, wine or oil.</P>
<P>Their religion is a mixture of the Chine&s;e wor&s;hip and other &s;uper&s;titions. They admit of the doctrine of tran&s;migration, believe the world to be eternal; imagine the air to be full of &s;pirits; but acknowledge one Supreme Being. Men of learning follow the doctrine of <HI>Confucius</HI> to whom they often &s;acrifice. They &s;tudy a&s;trology, and con&s;ult the pretenders in this art, on every occa&s;ion.

<P><HI>COCHIN-China</HI> is a kingdom that extends from the eighth degree of north latitude, to the 17th; is upwards of 400 miles long, and about 150 broad. It is bounded on the North by Tonquin; by the Chine&s;e &s;ea on the Ea&s;t; the Indian ocean on the South; and the kingdom of Camboya, on the We&s;t. It is divided into five provinces.

The inhabitants are Chochin-Chine&s;e, and &s;peak the Malayan language. The Engli&s;h had a &s;ettlement here in 1705, con&s;i&s;ting of 45 Europeans, whom the natives ma&s;&s;acred in their beds, on the &s;econd of March that year, and &s;et fire to the factory.

<P>The natives of Cochin-China have a common origin with the Tonquine&s;e; and differ &s;o little in their manner of living, laws and cu&s;toms, which they have borrowed, in great part, from the Chine&s;e, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe them.

<P>THE kingdom of Thibet, though partially vi&s;ited by &s;ome mi&s;&s;ionaries, was never properly explored, till Mr. <HI>Bogle</HI> went there. He re&s;ided &s;everal months at the capital of this kingdom, and it is expected, will one day favour the public with an account of it. The following is chiefly collected from his papers, by Mr. <HI>Stewart,</HI> and was &s;ent to our Royal Society.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="242">This country is known ih India by the name of Boutan. It lies north of Hindo&s;tan, and is all along &s;eparated from it, by a range of high and &s;teep mountains, properly a continuation of the great Cauca&s;us, which &s;tretches from ancient Media, and the &s;hores of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, round the north-ea&s;t frontiers of Per&s;ia, to Candahar and Ca&s;|&s;emire; and thence continuing its cour&s;e mor&s;e ea&s;terly, forms the great, northern barrier to the various provinces of the Mogul empire, and ends either in A&s;&s;am, or China. It is reckoned to be 640 leagues in extent, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and 650, from north to &s;outh; and is tributary to China.</P>
<P>The Bonzes of Thibet, about the year 1426, a&s;&s;umed the title of Grand Lamas, the mo&s;t powerful of whom made Laha&s;&s;a the place of his re&s;idence, and was acknow|ledged chief of all the Lamas: and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the Grand Lama, about the beginning of the la&s;t century, took the title of <HI>Delai Lama;</HI> at which time, an attempt was made, to introduce the chri&s;tian religion, by Father <HI>Andrada,</HI> a je&s;uit-mi&s;&s;ionary, and the reigning prince &s;eemed inclined to embrace it; but the Delai-Lama op|po&s;ed him, made a league with the Tartars of Kokonor, marched an army again&s;t him, defeated him, and put him to death.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bogle</HI> divides the territories of the Delai Lama into two different parts. That which lies immediately conti|guous to Bengal, and is called by the inhabitants <HI>Docpo,</HI>
<PB N="233" REF="243">
he di&s;tingui&s;hes by the name of <HI>Boutan;</HI> and the other, which extends to the northward, as far as the frontiers of Tartary, called, by the natives, <HI>P&ucirc;,</HI> he &s;tyles <HI>Thibet.</HI> Boutan is ruled by the Dah Terriah, or Deb Rajah, who is a feudatory of Thibet. It is a country of &s;teep and in|acce&s;&s;ible mountains, who&s;e &s;ummits are crowned with eternal &s;now. They are inter&s;ected with deep vallies, through which numberle&s;s torrents pour, that increa&s;e in their cour&s;e, and at la&s;t gaining the plains, lo&s;e them&s;elves in the great rivers of Bengal. The&s;e mountains are co|vered, down their &s;ides, with fore&s;ts of &s;tately trees, of various kinds, pines, &amp;c. many of which are known in Europe, and others peculiar to this country and climate. The vallies and &s;ides of the hills, which admit of culti|vation, are not unfruitful, but produce crops of wheat, barley, and rice.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are a &s;tout and warlike people, of a copper complexion, in &s;ize rather above the middle, Eu|ropean &s;tature, ha&s;ty and quarrel&s;ome in their temper, and addicted to the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors; but hone&s;t in their dealings: robbery, by violence, being almo&s;t unknown to them.</P>
<P>The chief city is Ta&s;&s;ey Seddein, &s;ituated on the Pat|choo. Thibet begins properly from the top of the great ridge of the Cauca&s;us; and extends from thence, in breadth, to the confines of Great Tartary, and perhaps to &s;ome of the dominions of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. Mr. <HI>Bogle</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="244">
&s;ays, that having once attained the &s;ummit of the Boutan mountains, we do not de&s;cend, in an equal proportion, on the &s;ide of Thibet; but, continuing &s;till on a very ele|vated ba&s;e, traver&s;e vallies wider, and not &s;o deep as the former, and mountains neither &s;o &s;teep, nor apparently &s;o high. On the other hand, he repre&s;ents it, as the mo&s;t bare and de&s;olate country he ever &s;aw. The woods, which every where cover the mountains in Boutan, are here to|tally unknown: except a few &s;traggling trees near the vil|lages, nothing of the &s;ort is to be &s;een. The climate is extremely &s;evere and rude. At Chamn&agrave;nning, where he wintered, although in latitude 31&deg; 39&prime;, only eight degrees north of Calcutta, he often found the thermometer, in his room, at 29&deg; under the freezing point, by <HI>Fahren|heit</HI>'s &s;cale; and, in the middle of April, the &s;tanding waters were all frozen, and heavy &s;howers of &s;now per|petually fell; owing, no doubt, to the great elevation of the country, and to the va&s;t, frozen &s;pace over which the north-wind blows uninterruptedly, from the Pole, through the va&s;t de&s;arts of Siberia and Tartary, till it is &s;topped by this formidable wall.</P>
<P>The Thibetians are of &s;maller &s;ize than their &s;outhern neighbours, and of a le&s;s robu&s;t make. Their com|plexions are al&s;o fairer, and many of them have even a rud|dine&s;s in their countenances, unknown in the other cli|mates of the Ea&s;t. Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI> &s;ays, that he &s;aw, at Calcutta, one who had quite the Tartar-face. They are of a mild and chearful temper, continues Mr. <HI>Bogle;</HI> and
<PB N="235" REF="245">
the higher ranks are polite and entertaining in conver|&s;ation, in which they never mix either flattery, or any &s;trained compliments.</P>
<P>The common people, both in Boutan aad Thibet, are cloathed in coar&s;e, woollen &s;tuffs, of their own manufac|ture, lined with &s;uch &s;kins as they can procure; but the better order of men, are dre&s;&s;ed in European cloth, or China &s;ilk, lined with the fine&s;t Siberian furs; the u&s;e of linen, is totally unknown among them. The Lamas of Thibet, wear a napped kind of woollen &s;tuff. The Delai Lama is cloathed in a red dre&s;s of this &s;tuff, wearing on his head a yellow cap, ornamented with gilding. Be&s;ides this cap, the Lamas wear, occa&s;ionally, a tiara, re&s;em|bling a bi&s;hop's mitre; but the cloven part of this mitre is in front, and comes down to the forehead. The Lamas in China appear in public, inve&s;tments of red and yellow &s;atin, trimmed with the riche&s;t furs; are all mount|ed on excellent hor&s;es, and are followed by a number of dome&s;tics, proportioned to their ranks as mandarins, which rank they are allowed.</P>
<P>The Thibetians &s;peak a language different from the Tartars, and almo&s;t &s;imilar to the Chine&s;e Sifans. Their chief food is the milk of their cattle, prepared into chee&s;e, butter, or mixed with the flour of a coar&s;e barley, or of peas, the only grain which their &s;oil produces, and even the&s;e articles are in &s;canty proportion; but they are fur|ni&s;hed with rice and wheat from Bengal, and other coun|tries
<PB N="236" REF="246">
in their neighbourhood. They are al&s;o &s;upplied with fi&s;h, from the rivers in their own, and the neighbouring provinces, &s;alted, and &s;ent into the interior parts. They have no want of animal food, from the cattle, &s;heep, and hogs, which are rai&s;ed upon their hills; and are not de&s;|titute of game. They have a &s;ingular method of prepar|ing their mutton, by expo&s;ing the carca&s;e entire, after the entrails are taken out, to the &s;un and bleak, northern winds, which blow in the months of Augu&s;t and Sep|tember, without fro&s;t, and which &s;o dries up the juices and parches the &s;kin, that the meat will keep uncorrupted, for the year round. This they generally eat raw, without any other preparation. Mr. <HI>Bogle</HI> was often regaled with this di&s;h; which, however unpalatable at fir&s;t, he &s;ays, he afterwards preferred to their dre&s;&s;ed mutton, ju&s;t killed, which was generally tough, lean and rank. It was al&s;o common for the principal men in the villages, through which he pa&s;&s;ed, to make him pre&s;ents of &s;heep &s;o pre|pared, &s;et before him on their legs, as if they had been alive.</P>
<P>Polygamy, at lea&s;t in the &s;en&s;e we commonly receive the word, is not in practice among them; but it exi&s;ts, in a manner more repugnant to European ideas. It con&s;i&s;ts in a plurality of hu&s;bands, which is firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed and highly re&s;pected there; and, the degree of kindred between the hu&s;bands, are no ob&s;tacle to the marriage. A woman, for example, may marry all the brothers of one family: the children are divided among them; the elde&s;t has the
<PB N="237" REF="247">
fir&s;t-born, and the younger, tho&s;e that are born afterwards. Notwith&s;tanding &s;uch brothers having one wife in common, they generally live in great harmony and comfort with her; not but &s;ometimes little di&s;&s;entions will ari&s;e (as may happen in families con&s;tituted on different principles). An in&s;tance of which Mr. <HI>Bogle</HI> mentions, in the ca&s;e of a mode&s;t and virtuous lady, the wife of half a dozen of the Tay&s;hoo Lama's nephews, who complained to the uncle, that the two younge&s;t of her hu&s;bands, did not furni&s;h that quota of love and benevolence to the common &s;tock, which duty and religion required of them. Their excu&s;e for this cu&s;tom (which, &s;trange as it is, is an unque&s;tion|able fact), is the &s;carcity of women in Thibet and Tar|tary. More girls than boys are &s;een in their families; of cour&s;e, the plea is a pretended one. Indeed, in a country where the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting a family are not ea&s;ily found, it &s;eems not impolitic to allow a &s;et of bro|thers to agree in rai&s;ing one, which is to be maintained by their joint efforts.</P>
<P>The manner of be&s;towing their dead is al&s;o &s;ingular, They neither inter them, like Europeans, nor burn them, like the Hindoos; but expo&s;e them on the bleak pin|nacle of &s;ome neighbouring mountain, to be devoured by wild bea&s;ts and bird of prey, or wa&s;ted away by time, and the changes of weather. The mangled carca&s;es, and bleached bones, lie &s;cattered about; and, amid&s;t this &s;eene of horror, &s;ome mi&s;erable, old wretch, man or woman, lo&s;t to all feelings but tho&s;e of &s;uper&s;tition, generally &s;ets
<PB N="238" REF="248">
up an abode, to perform the di&s;mal office of receiving the bodies, a&s;&s;igning each a place, and gathering up the re|mains, when too widely di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>The city of Laha&s;&s;a, which is the capital of Thibet, is of no incon&s;iderable &s;ize, and is repre&s;ented as populous and flouri&s;hing. It is the re&s;idence of officers of govern|ment, and of the Chine&s;e mandarins, and their &s;uite. It is al&s;o inhabited by Chine&s;e and Ca&s;&s;emirian merchants and artificers; and is the daily re&s;ort of numberle&s;s traders from all quarters, who come in occa&s;ional parties, or in &s;tated caravans. The waters of the Great River, as it is called emphatically in their language, wa&s;h its walls, Father <HI>Du Halde</HI> traces this river, with great accuracy. It ri&s;es in the Ca&s;&s;emirian mountains, runs through the great valley of Thibet, till, turning &s;uddenly to the &s;outh|ward, it flows into the middle of the kingdom of A&s;&s;am, thence returns, traver&s;ing that country we&s;terly, enters Bengal towards Rangamatty, and thence, bending its cour&s;e more &s;outherly, joins the Ganges, its &s;i&s;ter and rival, with an equal, if not more copious &s;tream; form|ing, at the conflux, a body of fre&s;h, running water, hardly to be equalled in the known world; and di&s;emboguing it|&s;elf into the bay of Bengal. Two &s;uch rivers uniting, in this happy country, with all the beauty, fertility, and convenience which they bring, well entitles it to the name of the <HI>Paradi&s;e of Nations,</HI> always be&s;towed upon it by the Moguls.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="249">Their cities, in general, are very &s;mall; and indeed, Laha&s;&s;a it&s;elf, is rather a celebrated temple than a city. As to fortified towns, or places of defence, they have none. The re&s;idence of the Delai Lama is at Pateli, a va&s;t palace, on a mountain near the banks of the Baram-pooler, about &s;even miles from Laha&s;&s;a. The Tay&s;hoo Lama, who, in authority and &s;anctity of character, is next to the Delai Lama, and who, during the minority of the latter, acts as chief; this Tay&s;hoo Lama has &s;everal palaces and ca&s;tles, in one of which Mr. <HI>Bogle</HI> lived with him, five months. Every thing within his gates, breath|ed peace, order, and dignified elegance. The ca&s;tle is of &s;tone, or brick, with many courts, lofty halls, terraces, and porticoes; and the apartments are, in general, roomy, and highly fini&s;hed, in the Chine&s;e &s;tile, with gilding, painting, and varni&s;h. But there are two conveniences to which they are utter &s;trangers; namely, &s;tair-ca&s;es and windows. There is no acce&s;s to the upper rooms, but by a &s;ort of ladders, of wood or iron; and for windows, they have only holes in the cielings, with pent-hou&s;e covers, contrived &s;o as to &s;hut up on the weather-&s;ide. Firing is &s;o &s;carce, that little is u&s;ed, but for culinary pur|po&s;es; and they tru&s;t altogether for warmth in their hou&s;es, to their furs, and other cloathing. When Mr. <HI>Bogle</HI> conver&s;ed with the Lama, he gave him to under|&s;tand, that his knowledge was not merely confined to his own country; but he found, that the Ru&s;&s;ian empire was the only one in Europe known to him, that he had a high idea of its riches and &s;trength, and had heard of its wars
<PB N="240" REF="250">
and &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the empire of Rome (for &s;o they call the Turki&s;h &s;tate), but could not conceive, it could be in any wi&s;e a match for Cathay. Many of the Tartar &s;ubjects of Ru&s;&s;ia, travel to Thibet; and the court of Peter&s;burgh has, at various times, &s;ent letters and pre&s;ents to the Lama. Mr. <HI>Bogle</HI> &s;aw many European articles in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;uch as pictures, looking-gla&s;&s;es, and trinkets of gold, &s;ilver and &s;teel, made in England, which he had received as pre&s;ents from Ru&s;&s;ia, and particularly a repeat|ing-watch by <HI>Graham,</HI> which not going, they &s;aid, had been dead for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>Of the religion and political con&s;titution of this country, which are intimately blended, I can only &s;ay, that ever &s;ince the expul&s;ion of the Eluth Tartars, the kingdom of Thibet is con&s;idered as dependant on China, which they call <HI>Cathay;</HI> and that there actually re&s;ide two mandarins, with a garri&s;on of 1,000 Chine&s;e, at Laha&s;&s;a the capital, to &s;upport the government; but their power does not extend far: and, in fact, the Lama, who&s;e empire is founded on the fure&s;t grounds, per&s;onal affection and religious re|verence, governs every thing internally with unbounded authority. We have &s;een that the Delai Lama is the great object of adoration among the various tribes of heathen Tartars, who roam through the va&s;t tract of continent, which &s;tretches from the banks of the Wolga to Corea, on the &s;ea of Japan; the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, religious domi|nion, perhaps, on the face of the globe. He is not only the Sovereign Pontiff, the vice-gerent of the Deity on
<PB N="241" REF="251">
earth; but, as &s;uper&s;tition is ever the &s;tronge&s;t, where it is furthe&s;t removed from its objects, the more remote Tar|tars regard him as the Deity him&s;elf. They believe him, as I have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve before, immortal, and endowed with all knowledge and virtue. Every year they come up, from different parts, to wor&s;hip, and make rich offerings at his &s;hrine. Even the Emperor of China, who is a Mantchou Tartar, does not fail in acknowledg|ments to him, in his religious capacity; and actually en|tertains, at a great expence, in the palace of Peking, an inferior Lama, as has been noticed, as a nuncio from Thibet. It is even reported, that many of the Tartar chiefs receive certain pre&s;ents, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;mall por|tions of that from him, which is ever regarded, in all other per&s;ons, as the mo&s;t humiliating proof of human nature, and of being &s;ubject to its laws, and trea&s;ure it up with great reverence, in gold boxes, to be mixed occa|&s;ionally in their ragouts. Mr. <HI>Bogle</HI> indeed, a&s;&s;erts, that the Lama makes no &s;uch pre&s;ents; but that he often di&s;|tributes little balls of con&s;ecrated flour, like the <HI>pain benit</HI> of the Roman Catholics, which the &s;uper&s;tition and blind credulity of his Tartar votaries, may afterwards convert into what they plea&s;e. On the mountain where his palace &s;tands, are a great number of pagods, the mo&s;t &s;umptuous of which he inhabits. He pa&s;&s;es great part of his life on a kind of altar, &s;itting cro&s;s-legged and motionle&s;s, on a large and magnificent cu&s;hion; and receives the ado|ration, not only of the people of Thibet, but of a pro|digious number of pilgrims, who undertake long and dif|ficult
<PB N="242" REF="252">
journies to wor&s;hip him on their knees, and receive his benediction. He &s;alutes no one; neither uncovers, nor ri&s;es, to the greate&s;t prince: he merely lays his hand on the head of his votary, who imagines, that by this impo&s;ition, he receives a remi&s;&s;ion of his &s;ins.</P>
<P>This profound veneration paid him, ari&s;es from an opinion, that all the divinity of the god Fo centers in him; and, that when he appears to die, either of old age or in|firmity, his &s;oul, in fact, only quits an actual, crazy habi|tation, to look for another, younger or better; and it is di&s;covered again, in the body of &s;ome child, by certain tokens, known only to the Lamas, or prie&s;ts, in which order he always appears.</P>
<P>Large pagods are frequendy met with in Thibet, where the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of the Lamas re&s;ide, and a&s;&s;ume different titles of honour. The grand Lamas are 200 in number; and, when common Lamas arrive to the dignity of one of the&s;e, whether Thibetian, Tartar, or Chine&s;e, they live in &s;plendor and opulence, and are con|tinually &s;urrounded by a crowd of admirers, who load them with pre&s;ents, and they become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great e&s;tates. Indeed, the Lamas form the mo&s;t powerful body in the &s;tate, have the prie&s;thood entirely in their own hands, and be&s;ides, fill up many mona&s;tic orders, which are held in great veneration among them. Celibacy does not &s;eem to be po&s;itively enjoined to the Lamas; but it is held indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary for both men and women, who
<PB N="243" REF="253">
embrace a religious life; and this celibacy, their living in communities, their cloi&s;ters, their &s;ervice in the choirs, their &s;trings of beads, their fa&s;ts, and their penances, give them &s;o much the air of chri&s;tian monks, that it is not &s;urprizing an illiterate capuchin &s;hould be ready to hail them as brothers, and think he can trace the features of St. Francis in every thing about them. It is an old notion, that the religion of Thibet is a corruption of chri&s;tianity; but, from whence&s;oever it &s;prung, it is pure and &s;imple in its &s;ource, conveying very exalted notions of the Deity, with no contemptible &s;y&s;tem of morality; but, in its pro|gre&s;s, it has been greatly altered and corrupted, by the in|ventions of worldly men&mdash;a fate we can hardly regret, in a &s;y&s;tem of error; &s;ince we know that, that of truth, has been &s;ubject to the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Though many of the principal <HI>dogmata</HI> of Lamai&s;m are totally repugnant to the religion of the Bramins, or of India, yet, in others, it has a great affinity to it. They have, for example, a great veneration for the cow; but they transfer it wholly from the common &s;pecies, to that which bears the tails, of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter. They al&s;o highly re&s;pect the waters of the Ganges; the &s;ource of which they believe to be in heaven, and one of the fir&s;t effects which the treaty between our India-company with the Lama produced, was, an application to the governor-general, for leave to build a place of wor&s;hip on its banks; which was granted, and a &s;pot was appropriated for that purpo&s;e, about two or three miles from Calcutta.
<PB N="244" REF="254">
Of this water, &s;ome is always kept in the palace, at Pe|king; and the Emperor carries &s;ome with him, whenever he travels. On the other hand, the Sumnia&s;&s;es, or Indian pilgrims, often vi&s;it Thibet, as a holy place; and the Lama always entertains a body of two or three hundred in his pay.</P>
<P>The chief trade from Laha&s;&s;a to Peking, is carried on by caravans, that employ full two years in the journey, thither and back again; which is not &s;urpri&s;ing, when we con&s;ider, that the di&s;tance cannot be le&s;s than 2,000 Engli&s;h miles; and yet it is to be ob&s;erved, that an ex|pre&s;s from Laha&s;&s;a reaches Peking in three weeks;&mdash;a cir|cum&s;tance much to the honour of the Chine&s;e police, which knows how to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;o &s;peedy and effectual a communication, through mountains and de&s;arts, for &s;o long a way.</P>
<P>The Thibetians, be&s;ides a le&s;s traffic with their neigh|bours, in hor&s;es, hogs, rock-&s;alt, coar&s;e cloths, and other articles, enjoy four, &s;taple articles, which are &s;ufficient in them&s;elves to procure every foreign commodity of which they &s;tand in need; all of which are natural pro|ductions, and de&s;erve to be particularly noticed. The fir&s;t, though the lea&s;t con&s;iderable, is that of the cow-tails, &s;o famous all over India, Per&s;ia, and the other kingdoms of the ea&s;t. It is produced by a &s;pecies of cow, or bullock, different from what I believe is found, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Stewart,</HI> in any other country. It is of a larger
<PB N="245" REF="255">
&s;ize than the common Thibet breed; has &s;hort horns, and no hump on its back. Its &s;kin is covered with whiti&s;h hair, of a &s;ilky appearance; but its chief &s;ingularity, is in its tail, which &s;preads out broad and long, with flowing hairs, like that of a beautiful mare, but much finer, and far more glo&s;&s;y. The&s;e tails &s;ell very high, and are u&s;ed, mounted on &s;ilver handles, for <HI>Chowras,</HI> or bru&s;hes, to cha&s;e away the flies; and no man of con&s;equence, in India, ever goes out, or &s;its in form at home, without two <HI>Chowrawbadars,</HI> or bru&s;hers, attending him, with &s;uch in&s;truments in their hands.</P>
<P>The next article is the wool, from which the &s;hawl, the mo&s;t delicate, woollen manufacture in the world, &s;o much prized in the ea&s;t, and now &s;o well known in England, is made. This wool is the produce of a Thibet &s;heep. They are of a &s;mall breed, in figure nothing differing from our &s;heep, except in their tails, which are very broad; but their fleeces, for the finene&s;s, length, and beauty of the wool, exceed all others in the world. The &s;hawls made from this wool, all come from Ca&s;&s;emire; and the Ca&s;&s;emirians engro&s;s this article, and have factors e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, for the purcha&s;e of the wool, in every part of Thibet; from whence it is &s;ent to Ca&s;&s;emire, where it is worked up, and becomes a great &s;ource of wealth to that country, as well as it is originally to Thibet.</P>
<P>Mu&s;k is another of their &s;taple articles. The deer which produces it, is common in the mountains; but, being ex|ceedingly
<PB N="246" REF="256">
&s;hy, and frequenting only places the mo&s;t wild and difficult of acce&s;s, hunting it becomes a trade of great trouble and danger. The mu&s;k is &s;ent down to Calcutta in the natural bag, not without great ri&s;k of its being adulterated; but &s;till it is far &s;uperior to any thing of the kind &s;old in Europe.</P>
<P>Their la&s;t &s;taple article is gold, of which great quan|tities are exported from Thibet. It is found in the &s;ands of the Great River, as well as in mo&s;t of the &s;mall brooks and torrents that pour from the mountains. The quantity collected in this manner, though con&s;iderable with re&s;pect to national gain, pays the individual but very moderately for the labour be&s;towed on it. There are, however, mines of this metal, in the northern parts, which are the re&s;erved property of the Lama, and rented out to tho&s;e who work them. It is not found in ore, but always in a pure, me|tallic &s;tate, and only requires to be &s;eparated from the &s;par, &s;tone, or flint, to which it adheres. Mr. <HI>Ha&s;tings,</HI> the governor-general of Bengal, had a lump &s;ent him to Cal|cutta, of about the &s;ize of a bullock's kidney, which was a hard flint, covered with &s;olid gold. He cau&s;ed it to be fawn in two, and it was found, throughout, &s;treaked with the pure&s;t metal. Though they have this gold in great plenty in Thibet, they never coin any of it into money; yet it is &s;till u&s;ed there as a medium of commerce, and goods are rated by the pur&s;e of gold-du&s;t, as here by pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="257">By a letter &s;ent by the Lama to Mr. <HI>Ha&s;tings,</HI> in March, 1774, written in Per&s;ian, and tran&s;lated by Mr. <HI>Stewart,</HI> this high-prie&s;t &s;eems not only to be a &s;en&s;ible man, but a man of &s;ome learning and policy.</P>
<P>A Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter,</HI> a gentleman in the Ea&s;t-India-company's &s;ervice, pa&s;&s;ed from Bengal, through Thibet, and contrived to penetrate between that kingdom and the Ca&s;pian &s;ea; but when we &s;hall be favoured with his narrative, is at pre&s;ent uncertain.</P>
<P>The country of HAMI, is &s;ituated north-ea&s;t of China, at the extremity of the de&s;art of Cobi, 90 leagues only di&s;tant from the province of Chen-&s;i. Its prince is a va&s;&s;al of the Chine&s;e emperor, and pays tribute to the Emperor. The country, though &s;urrounded with de&s;arts, is one of the mo&s;t delightful in the world, producing every kind of grain, fruit, and culinary herbs. Their melons are more whole&s;ome than European ones, and will keep fre&s;h almo&s;t all the winter. In 1778, &s;ome &s;eeds were brought to Paris, were &s;own the year following, and &s;uc|ceeded well; but, the mo&s;t e&s;teemed production of Hami, is its dried rai&s;ins, which have been &s;ince cultivated in China. The latitude of this place is 42&deg; 53&prime;, more northward than many provinces of France, and yet the grapes thrive better here than there, and have a &s;uperior flavour.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="258">It never rains in Hami; and &s;eldom is dew, or fog, &s;een there. The country is watered only by the &s;now, which falls in winter, who&s;e waters are carefully pre&s;erved all the &s;ummer. The Chine&s;e dry their grapes, or rai|&s;ins, by holding them over the &s;team of hot urine, and &s;ometimes boiling them, a few &s;econds, in wine, with a little clarified honey in it; but the people of Hami, let them &s;tand to be ripe, then gather them, and only hang them in the &s;un. They &s;hrivel, but lo&s;e none of their &s;ub&s;tance, or grow flat. Good rai&s;ins &s;hould be almo&s;t as cri&s;p as &s;ugar-candy.</P>
<P>Hami has a number of villages, but only one city, which is &s;urrounded with lofty walls, half a league in cir|cumference, with two beautiful gates, to the ea&s;t and we&s;t, which make a fine appearance at a di&s;tance. The &s;treets are &s;traight, and well laid out; the hou&s;es have only ground-floors, and are built with clay: but, notwith|&s;tanding this, as the city &s;tands in a beautiful plain, wa|tered by a river, &s;heltered by mountains on the north, and enjoys a &s;erene &s;ky, it is a delightful place of re&s;idence. Approach it, which way we will, gardens may be &s;een, containing every thing a fertile and cultivated foil can pro|duce, in the milde&s;t climates. All the &s;urrounding fields are enchanting, terminating in dry plains, covered with beautiful hou&s;es, and the large, broad-tailed &s;heep. The country appears to abound with fine fo&s;&s;ils, and valuable minerals. The Chine&s;e have, for a long time, procured diamonds, and a great deal of gold from it; and it
<PB N="249" REF="259">
&s;upplies them with a kind of agate, which they prize ex|ceedingly.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to inhabitants of this &s;mall &s;tate; they re&s;emble the Chine&s;e, in almo&s;t every thing; are brave, capable of enduring fatigue, very dextrous in all athletic exerci&s;es, and make excellent &s;oldiers. They are fickle, however, and &s;oon irritated; and, when in a pa&s;&s;ion, ex|tremely ferocious and &s;anguinary.</P>
<P>The ISLAND OF FORMOSA, called, by the Chine&s;e, <HI>Tai-ouan,</HI> lies, as it were, at their own door, within 30 leagues of the province of Fo-kien; and yet they did not di&s;cover it till the year 1430. It is &s;ituated between 22&deg; 8&prime; and 25&deg; 20&prime; N. latitude, is about 85 leagues long, and 25 broad. A long chain of mountains runs through it, from north to &s;outh, and divides it into two parts, ea&s;tern and we&s;tern. The Dutch &s;ettled in the we&s;tern part in 1634, and built the fort of Zealand, which &s;ecured to them the chief harbour in the i&s;land; but they were driven from thence, by a Chine&s;e pirate, in 1661; who took the place, and, in 1682, &s;ubmitted to the Em|peror of China.</P>
<P>The capital city, Ta&iuml;-ouan, is in the we&s;tern part; and is large, well peopled, and a place of great trade. Every nece&s;&s;ary of life may be found in it; being as exten&s;ive as &s;ome fir&s;t-rate cities in China. Its natural productions are, rice, &s;ugar, tobacco, &s;alt, fruits of all kind, medi|cinal
<PB N="250" REF="260">
herbs, cotton, cloth, hemp, &amp;c. The greater part of the &s;treets are laid out in a &s;traight line, and are all co|vered with an awning, for &s;even or eight months in the year, to moderate the exce&s;&s;ive heat. The&s;e &s;treets are 30 or 40 feet wide, and many of them a league long, full of rich &s;hops on both &s;ides, in which are di&s;played &s;ilks, china, lacquer-ware, &amp;c. alll ranged with &s;uch order and &s;ymmetry, as to wear the appearance of &s;o many de|corated galleries; and was not the pavement &s;o bad, and the place &s;o much crowded with pa&s;&s;engers, it would be a plea&s;ure to walk through them. The hou&s;es are gene|rally built of clay, and bamboo reeds, and the roofs thatch|ed with &s;traw; but the awning leaves nothing to be &s;een but the &s;hops. There is only one hand&s;ome hou&s;e in the whole city. This was built by the Dutch, when here; is a large edifice, three &s;tories high, and defended by four demi-ba&s;tions. The city has no walls, or works, to de|fend it; its harbour is a good one, but is choking up with &s;and, and will be &s;oon rendered u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>That part of the i&s;land which the Chine&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s, has a number of fertile and exten&s;ive plains, with many rivulets, and a pure and whole&s;ome air. The ea&s;tern &s;ide is inha|bited by Indians wholly. Mo&s;t of the Indian fruits are found here; and tobacco, &s;ugar, pepper, camphire and cinnamon, are common. Hor&s;es, &s;heep, hogs and goats, are &s;carce; but dome&s;tic fowls are plentiful, and monkies and &s;tags have multiplied &s;o much, that they wander about in large flocks. For want of hor&s;es and mules, the inha|bitants
<PB N="251" REF="261">
train up oxen for riding, and, by exerci&s;e, they go as well and expeditiou&s;ly as the be&s;t hor&s;es, being fur|ni&s;hed with bridles, &s;addles, and cruppers. And a Chine&s;e looks as big and proud, when mounted in this manner, as if carried by the fine&s;t Barbary cour&s;er.</P>
<P>The only thing wanting, to make this i&s;land de&s;ire|able, is whole&s;ome water. They have not a drop fit to drink; to &s;trangers, it is a deadly poi&s;on; there is none but the water of the capital that can be drank. Be&s;ides this city, there are two others, and &s;ome villages, inha|bited by Chine&s;e alone; for they do not &s;uffer any Indians to live with them, but &s;uch as are &s;laves, or dome&s;tics. The Indians inhabit villages to the north and &s;outh of them, and keep them in awe. A garri&s;on of 10,000 Tartars is kept in the capital, which are changed every three years, or oftener, if nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The Indian habitations are merely earth-huts, without any kind of furniture, and they live on rice, and the game they catch; and we are a&s;&s;ured, they will run with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing &s;wiftne&s;s, as to out&s;trip the &s;wifte&s;t greyhound. This the Chine&s;e attribute to their confining their knees and reins, by a light bandage, till they are 14 or 15 years old. The women till the land, and the men are employ|ed in hunting. Their favourite arms are lances, which they will throw with great dexterity, &s;o as to hit a mark at 60 or 80 feet di&s;tance; but they have bows and arrows, and will kill a phea&s;ant flying, with as much

<P>On the 22d of May 1782, the waters of the ocean had very nigh deprived China of this I&s;land, owing to an earthquake, as it is apprehended.

Of 27 &s;hips of war in the harbour, (by the&s;e are meant Chine&s;e gallies), 12 di&s;appeared; two were da&s;hed to pieces, and ten were &s;o &s;hattered as to be unfit for &s;ervice.

<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE North-We&s;tern Coa&s;ts of America. From Captain <HI>Cook,</HI> who vi&s;ited tho&s;e places in the Summer of 1778.</HEAD>
<P>THE continent of America, being now traced to the north-we&s;t, from California, quite up to latitude 70 north; it appears to be &s;eparated only from the ea&s;tern-mo&s;t coa&s;t of A&s;ia, by a &s;treight of 13 leagues in breadth, called Bherings &s;traits. Captain <HI>Cook</HI> coa&s;ted this continent from Nootka-Sound, in latitude 50. to Norton-Sound, in latitude 64; an extent of 700 miles. He was not &s;o long on &s;hore, at any one time, as to be able to give a perfect de&s;cription of the country, and
<PB N="258" REF="268">
its inhabitants; but, as his is the be&s;t account, we can procure, the public mu&s;t re&s;t &s;atisfied, until they are furni&s;hed with a better. It is reported that a gentleman having travelled through A&s;ia, to the country of the T&s;choukt&s;ches, has cro&s;&s;ed Bherings-&s;treights, landed on the American continent; and means to pur&s;ue his way by land, through all that continent to Hud&s;on's-bay. Should he live to return, before the completion of this work, our readers may pro|bably have a fuller account of the &s;avage inhabitants of that part of the globe: but, circum&s;tanced as we are, we can only give them the following.</P>
<P><HI>Face of the country.</HI> The country in general &s;eems to be mountainous, and in the higher latitudes their mountains are covered with &s;now. Captain <HI>Cook</HI> di&s;covered two volcanos near the coa&s;t, one a com|plete cone, with its crater at the very &s;ummit in latitude 54&deg;. 48&prime;. N. and longitude 195&deg;. 45&prime;. E. This vulcano, when he was there, continually threw up va&s;t columns of black &s;moke. It was &s;eldom wholly clear of clouds; at times, both ba&s;e and &s;ummit would be clear, when a narrow cloud, &s;ometimes two or three, one above another, would embrace the middle, like a girdle, which, with the column of &s;moke, ri&s;ing per|pendicularly to a great height, out of its top, and &s;preading before the wind into a tail of va&s;t length, made a very picture&s;que appearance; and in the back ground of the &s;eene, &s;ome elevated mountains who&s;e
<PB N="259" REF="269">
tops towered above the clouds, to a mo&s;t &s;tupendous height, added not a little to its awful grandeur. It may be worth remarking, that the wind, at the height, to which the &s;moke of this vulcano reached, went &s;ometimes in a direction contrary to what it did at &s;ea; even when it blew a fre&s;h gale. The other volcano is in latitude 60&deg;. 23&prime;. but emitting only a white &s;moke and no fire, made no very &s;triking appearance.</P>
<P>At Nootka-&s;ound, the land ri&s;es every where into &s;teep hills, agreeing in their general form, ending in round or blunted tops, with &s;ome &s;harp, though not very prominent ridges on their &s;ides, and all of them cloath|ed round to their &s;ummits with the thicke&s;t woods, as well as all the flats bordering on the &s;ea. The &s;urface of the&s;e hills have but little &s;oil on them, their interior parts being &s;olid rocks, extending to the &s;ea-&s;hore.</P>
<P>The vallies in the neighbourhood of Prince Williams-Sound, which lies in latitude 61&deg;, are filled with pine-trees, about 50 feet high, and 4 feet in girth; and from the drift-wood, which con&s;i&s;ted only of firs, and which lay in quantities on the beach, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the pines, higher up the country, are much of the &s;ame &s;ize, and all of the &s;ame kind: not a Canadian pine or cypre&s;s is to be &s;een. Prince William's Sound is calcu|lated to be 520 leagues We&s;t of any part of Baffin's or Hud&s;on's-Bay; and Captain <HI>Cook</HI> was of opinion that
<PB N="260" REF="270">
if there is any pa&s;&s;age from one to the other, it mu&s;t be, at lea&s;t part of it, to the North of latitude 72&deg;.</P>
<P>Three degrees and a half We&s;t of Prince William's Sound, is the mouth of a very large river, that appears to be navigable, and extends a great way up into the country. This river is now called Cook's River, and the point of land being the mo&s;t ea&s;tern extremity of all America hitherto known, and lying but 13 leagues from Ea&s;t Cape on the continent of A&s;ia, is called, in the charts, Cape Prince of Wales, and &s;ituated in latitude 65&deg;. 46&prime;. and longitude from Greenwich, 191&deg;. 45&prime;. E.</P>
<P><HI>Climate.</HI> The climate at Nootka-Sound is infinitely milder than on the Ea&s;t coa&s;t of America, under the &s;ame parallel of latitude. The mercury in the thermometer in the month of April, never fell in the night lower than 42&deg;. and very often in the day, it ro&s;e to 60&deg;. No &s;uch thing as fro&s;t was perceived in any of the low grounds; on the contrary, vegetation had made a con|&s;iderable progre&s;s, and gra&s;s was already above a foot long.</P>
<P><HI>Produce.</HI> Though both tin and copper were met with in this country, there is little rea&s;on to believe that either of them belong to the place. Neither were any ores of metal &s;een, except a coar&s;e, red, earthy or ochry &s;ub|&s;tance, u&s;ed by the natives in painting them&s;elves, which may probably contain a little iron, with a white and a black pigment u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="271">Be&s;ides the rock and &s;tone that con&s;titutes the moun|tains and &s;hores, which &s;ometimes contain pieces of very coar&s;e quartz; things were &s;een among the natives, made of a hard, black granite, though not remarkably com|pact or fine grained; a greyi&s;h whet-&s;tone, the common oil-&s;tone of our carpenters, in coar&s;er or finer pieces, and &s;ome black bits, little inferior to the hone-&s;tone. The natives u&s;e al&s;o the tran&s;parent, leafy glimmer, or Mu&s;|covy gla&s;s, a brown, leafy or martial &s;ort; and they were &s;ometimes &s;een with pieces of rock chry&s;tal, toler|ably tran&s;parent. The fir&s;t two were met with in con|&s;iderable quantities, and probably are found on the &s;pot; but the latter &s;eemed to be brought from a greater di&s;|tance, and were held as valuable.</P>
<P>In Nootka-Sound, the trees con&s;i&s;t of the Canadian pine, the white cypre&s;s, <HI>Cypre&s;&s;us thyoides,</HI> or wild pine, with two or three other, le&s;s common pines. The fir&s;t two make up two thirds of the whole; they in general grew with great vigor, and were all of a large &s;ize.</P>
<P>Of other vegetable productions there is but little va|riety, though many might have &s;prung up. About the rocks were found &s;trawberry, ra&s;berry, currant and goo&s;eberry-bu&s;hes, and all in a thriving &s;tate, and &s;ome few, &s;mall, black alders; al&s;o a &s;pecies of &s;ow-thi&s;tle; goo&s;e-gra&s;s, &s;ome crow's-foot, with a fine crim&s;on flower; and two &s;orts of <HI>anthericum,</HI> one with a larg, orange flower, and the other with a blue one. Some few, wild ro&s;es
<PB N="262" REF="272">
were likewi&s;e met with, ju&s;t budding; a great quantity of young leeks, with triangular leaves; a &s;mall &s;ort of gra&s;s, and &s;ome water-cre&s;&s;es, which grew abundantly on the &s;ides of rills.</P>
<P>In latitude 60&deg; were found &s;ome currant and &s;trawberry-bu&s;hes; a &s;mall, yellow-flowered violet, and the leaves of a plant &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>heraclium</HI> of Linnaeus, and which the Americans here dre&s;s for food, in the &s;ame manner as the na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ives of Kamt&s;chtka. In latitude 64&deg;. in the month of September, when Captain <HI>Cook</HI> went a&s;hore, he found the country, where there was no wood, covered with heath, and other plants, which produced hurtle-berries, currant-berries, heath-berries, &amp;c. The berries were ripe; the hurtle-berries too much &s;o; and &s;carce a &s;ingle plant in flower. The under-wood con|&s;i&s;ted of birch, willow and alder, which grew thick among the trees. The la&s;t con&s;i&s;ted wholly of the &s;pruce-fir, none of them above &s;ix or eight inches in diameter.</P>
<P><HI>Animals.</HI> The animals of this country, could be col|lected only from the &s;kins in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the natives. There are bears, wolves, foxes, deer, racoons, polecats, martins, and the &s;ea- otters, which are found at the i&s;lands ea&s;t of Kamt&s;chtka. The bears are &s;mall, but of a &s;hining, black colour; the deer &s;eem to be the fallow-deer of Carolina. Foxes are in great plenty, and in as great variety; &s;ome being quite yellow, with a black tip to the tail, others of a deep or reddi&s;h yellow, intermixed with
<PB N="263" REF="273">
black; and a third &s;ort of a whiti&s;h grey, or a&s;h-colour, intermixed al&s;o with black. The ermine is likewi&s;e found here, but &s;mall and &s;carce, nor is the hair remarkably fine, tho' quite white, except at the tip of the tail; the racoons and &s;quirrels are of the common &s;ort, but the latter is le&s;s than ours, and has a deeper ru&s;ty colour running along the back.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Cook</HI> &s;ays, he was clear as to the exi&s;tence of all the above animals, but that there were two, which he could not di&s;tingui&s;h with that certainty; one &s;eemed to be that of the elk, or moo&s;e-deer, or buffalo; the other a &s;pecies of the wild cat, or lynx. Hogs, dogs and goats have not as yet found their way to this place; nor do the natives &s;eem to have any knowledge of our hou&s;e-rats. Such as they &s;aw on board the Engli&s;h &s;hips, they called &s;quirrels; and the goats they called <HI>eineetla,</HI> which is the name they give to fawns.</P>
<P>At Prince William's Sound, they have the white bear, the wolverene, or quickhatch, with very bright colours; and a large &s;ort of ermine; but one of the mo&s;t beauti|ful &s;kins met with, and which &s;eems peculiar to this place, is that of a &s;mall animal, about ten inches long, of a brown, or ru&s;ty colour on the back, with a great number of ob&s;cure whiti&s;h &s;pecks; and the &s;ides, of a bluei&s;h a&s;h-colour al&s;o, with a few of the&s;e &s;pecks, &s;omething of the mou&s;e or &s;quirrel kind.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="274">The &s;ea-animals &s;een off this coa&s;t are whales, por|poi&s;es and &s;eals. The porpoi&s;e is the <HI>phocena.</HI> The &s;ea-otter is of this cla&s;s, it living mo&s;tly in the water. Captain <HI>Cook</HI> having procured a young one, weighing only 25lb. made a drawing of it. It was of a &s;hining, or glo&s;&s;y black colour; but many of the hairs being tipt with white, gave it, at fir&s;t &s;ight, a greyi&s;h ca&s;t. The face, throat and brea&s;t were of a yellowi&s;h white, or very light brown colour, which in many of the &s;kins, extend the whole length of the belly. It had &s;ix cutting teeth, in each jaw; two of tho&s;e of the lower jaw being very minute, and placed without, at the ba&s;e of the two mid|dle ones. The fur of the&s;e animals, (as I have had oc|ca&s;ion to mention before, when &s;peaking of the trade at Kiachta) is certainly &s;ofter and finer than that of any other we know of; and therefore the di&s;covery of this part of the continent of North America, where &s;o valu|able an article of commerce may be met with, cannot be a matter of indifference. I have had one in my hand, and think it is as &s;oft as the &s;kin of a mole. It was of the &s;ame colour as a mole, but the fur rather longer. They are &s;old by the Ru&s;&s;ians at Kiachta to the Chine&s;e, from 16l. Engli&s;h, to 20l. the &s;kin.</P>
<P>Birds here, in general, are not only rare, as to the dif|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erent &s;pecies, but very &s;carce as to numbers, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew there are, are very &s;hy, being con&s;tantly pur&s;ued by the natives for their feathers. Tho&s;e which frequent the woods, are crows and ravens &s;imilar to ours; a bluei&s;h
<PB N="265" REF="275">
jay or magpye; common wrens, which are the only &s;ing|ing birds they have; the Canadian, or migrating thru&s;h, and a con&s;iderable number of brown eagles, with white heads and tails. They have al&s;o a &s;mall &s;pecies of hawk; the heron and the <HI>al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yon</HI> or large-cre&s;ted American king|fi&s;her. They have likewi&s;e two &s;pecies of woodpeckers, one le&s;s than a thru&s;h, black above, with white &s;pots on the wings, a crim&s;on head, neck and brea&s;t, and a yellowi&s;h, olive-coloured belly. The other is a larger and more ele|gant bird, of a du&s;ky brown colour on the back, richly waved with black, except about the head; the belly of a reddi&s;h ca&s;t, with round, black &s;pots; a black &s;pot on the brea&s;t, and the under-&s;ide of the wings and tail, a plain &s;carlet, tho' blacki&s;h above, with a crim&s;on &s;treak, run|ning from the angle of the mouth, a little down the neck on each &s;ide&punc; They have al&s;o a &s;mall bird of the finch|kind, about the &s;ize of a linnet, of a dark, du&s;ky colour, whiti&s;h below, with a black head and neck, and a white bill; and a &s;and-piper, the &s;ize of a &s;mall pigeon, of a du&s;ky brown colour; white below, except the throat and brea&s;t, with a broad, white band acro&s;s the wings. Add to the&s;e, humming-birds, which frequently flew about the &s;hips, whil&s;t at anchor; and a very beautiful bird of the hawk kind, met with in 56&deg;. N. latitude. It is &s;ome|thing le&s;s than a duck, and of a black colour, except the fore-part of the head, which is white; and from above and below each eye, ri&s;es an elegant, yellowi&s;h-white cre&s;t, revolved backwards, like a ram's horn: the bill and feet red. The&s;e are frequently &s;een in large flocks, and
<PB N="266" REF="276">
is a &s;ea-bird; perhaps the <HI>alca monochroa</HI> of Kamt&s;chatka, mentioned by <HI>Steller.</HI></P>
<P>The birds that frequent the waters and the &s;hores, are not more numerous than the others: the quebrantahue&s;|&s;os, gulls and &s;hags are &s;een off the coa&s;t. The &s;hag is our cormorant or water-crow. There are here two or three &s;orts of wild ducks, one black, with a white head, which flys in flocks; and the other white, with a red bill; al&s;o a browni&s;h duck, with a black or deep-blue head and neck. They have al&s;o grou&s;e, &s;nipes and plover: add to the&s;e, the great <HI>lumme,</HI> or diver, found in our northern countries.</P>
<P>Fi&s;h are more plentiful than birds, tho' not &s;o various. The principal &s;orts, found in numbers, are herrings about &s;even inches long; the anchovy, or &s;ardine; a white, or &s;ilver-coloured bream; and another of a gold, brown colour, with many narrow, longitudinal, blue &s;tripes. Other fi&s;h are &s;carce, as a &s;mall, brown kind of &s;culpin, &s;uch as is found on the coa&s;t of Norway: fro&s;t-fi&s;h; a large one, &s;omething like the bull head, with a rough &s;kin, without &s;cales; and a &s;mall, browni&s;h cod, &s;potted with white. There are al&s;o con&s;iderable quantities of the <HI>chimara,</HI> or little &s;ea-wolf, which is al&s;o a-kin to the elephant-fi&s;h; &s;ome few &s;harks, &s;tar-fi&s;h, crabs, and a large cuttle-fi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="277">About the rocks, there is abundance of large mu&s;cles, &s;ome a &s;pan long, containing now and then, large pearls, but badly &s;haped and coloured, and a variety of other &s;mall &s;hell-fi&s;h; and as the natives of Nootka-Sound, had &s;ome thick branches of red coral; we may conclude it is found upon the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The only animals of the reptile-kind, found here, are harmle&s;s, brown &s;nakes, &s;triped with white, about two feet long, and a browni&s;h water-lizzard, with a tail exactly like an eel.</P>
<P>The in&s;ect-tribe &s;eems to be more numerous; for tho' when Captain <HI>Cook</HI> was at Nootka, the &s;ea&s;on of their appearing was only beginning, he &s;aw four or five, dif|ferent &s;orts of common butterflies; many humble-bees; &s;ome of our common, goo&s;berry-moths; two or three &s;orts of flies, a few beetles, and &s;ome mu&s;quitoes.</P>
<P><HI>People.</HI> The people of Nootka-Sound, are, in gene|ral, of the common &s;tature, but not &s;lender in propor|tion, being commonly pretty full and plump, tho' not mu&s;cular. Their vi&s;ages are round and full, and &s;ome|times broad, with high, prominent cheek-bones; the face much depre&s;&s;ed above, &s;eemingly fallen in, acro&s;s, between the temples; the no&s;e flattening at the ba&s;e, with wide no&s;trils, and a rounded point; the forehead rather low; the eyes &s;mall, black, rather langui&s;hing than &s;parkling; the mouth round, with large, round, thick lips, and the
<PB N="268" REF="278">
teeth tolerably equal, and well &s;et, but not very white. Few of them have any beards, except old men; tho&s;e who have, wear it only on the chin, all the re&s;t they pluck out by the root. Their eyebrows are &s;canty and narrow, but the hair of their heads is very coar&s;e and &s;trong, and, without a &s;ingle exception, black, &s;treight and lank, hang|ing down over the &s;houlders. Their necks are &s;hort; their arms and body have no particular elegance in their form, but are rather clum&s;y, and the limbs in all, are very &s;mall, in proportion to the other parts, and crooked or ill made, with large feet, badly &s;haped, and projecting ancles; which la&s;t &s;eems to ari&s;e from their &s;quatting &s;o much on their hams and knees, both in their canoes and hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Their complexion is naturally as white as ours, but they &s;o incru&s;t their bodies with paint and dirt, that there is no di&s;tingui&s;hing the colour of their &s;kin. During their youth, &s;ome of them have no di&s;agreeable look, if com|pared with the generality of the people; but after attain|ing a certain age, they are all ugly alike. On the whole, a very remarkable &s;amene&s;s &s;eems to characterize the countenances of the whole nation: a dull, phleghmatic want of expre&s;&s;ion, with very little variation, being &s;trongly marked in all of them.</P>
<P>The women &s;o much re&s;emble the men, that it is not ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h them, e&s;pecially as they po&s;&s;e&s;s not &s;ufficient, natural delicacy, to render their per&s;ons agree|able:
<PB N="269" REF="279">
and not one did Captain <HI>Cook</HI> &s;ee, even among tho&s;e who were in the prime of life, who had the lea&s;t preten&s;ions to be called hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>In Prince William's Sound, the men are &s;quare-made, and &s;trong che&s;ted, with very large heads, di&s;proportioned to their bodies; &s;hort, thick necks, and large, broad, &s;pread|ing faces. Their eyes, tho' not &s;mall, are not propor|tioned to their faces, and their no&s;es are broad, and turned up at the tip; their teeth are broad, even and white; and their hair, like tho&s;e at Nootka, black, thick, &s;traight and &s;trong. Their beards, in general, thin or wanting, and about the lips of tho&s;e who had them, &s;tiff, bri&s;tly, and brown. With the&s;e people, indeed, the features vary, and tho' not hand&s;ome, their counte|nances commonly indicate a con&s;iderable &s;hare of vivacity, good-nature and frankne&s;s; yet &s;ome have an air of &s;ul|lenne&s;s and re&s;erve. Some of their women have agree|able faces, and many are here di&s;tingui&s;hable from the men, by a delicacy of features. The complexion of the women is fair, but that of the men, browni&s;h or &s;warthy.</P>
<P>The natives of Norton-Sound, re&s;emble tho&s;e of Prince William's Sound, differing much, as we have &s;hewn, from the natives of Nootka, who, according to the be&s;t calculation, Captain <HI>Cook</HI> could make, by the number of hou&s;es in the two towns of Nootka, and tho&s;e
<PB N="270" REF="280">
people whom he &s;aw in this la&s;t Sound, amount to about 2000 in the whole.</P>
<P>The common dre&s;s of the inhabitants of Nootka, is a flaxen mantle, trimmed on the upper edge, with a nar|row &s;trip of fur, and at the lower edge, with fringe and ta&s;&s;els. It pa&s;&s;es under the left arm, and is tied over the right &s;houlder, by a &s;tring before and one behind, near its middle; thus both arms are left free, and it hangs, evenly covering the left &s;ide, but leaving the right open, except from the loo&s;e edges falling on it, and except when it is tied round the wai&s;t, with a girdle of coar&s;e matting or woollen, which is often done. Over this mantle, which reaches below the knees, is worn a &s;mall cloak of the &s;ame materials, fringed at bottom, and reaching to the wai&s;t. This cloak re&s;embles a round di&s;h-cover, being quite clo&s;e, except in the middle, where there is a hole, ju&s;t large enough to admit the head, and then re&s;ting on the &s;houlders, it covers the arms to the elbows, and the body, as far as the wai&s;t. The head is covered with a cap of a truncated cone, or like a flower-pot, made of fine matting, having the top frequently ornamented with a round or pointed knob, or bunch of leather ta&s;&s;els, and tied under the chin, to prevent its being blown off.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above dre&s;s, common to both &s;exes, the men frequently throw over this cloak, a bear, wolf, or &s;ea-otter's &s;kin, with the hair outwards, and tie it above, as an outer cloak, wearing it &s;ometimes behind, and &s;ometimes
<PB REF="281">

on the brea&s;t before. In rainy weather, they throw a coar&s;e mat over their &s;houlders. The hair is commonly worn, hanging down loo&s;e, but &s;ome, when they have no cap, tie it in a bunch, on the crown of the head. This dre&s;s, were it kept clean, would by no means be inele|gant; but as they rub their bodies over with a red paint, of a clayey or coar&s;e, ochry &s;ub&s;tance, mixed with oil, their garments contract a rancid, offen&s;ive &s;mell, and a grea&s;y na&s;tine&s;s, &s;o that they make a very wretched and dirty ap|pearance; and what is &s;till wor&s;e, their heads and clothes &s;warm with vermin, which they pick off with great com|po&s;ure, and eat.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t their bodies are thus always daubed with red paint, their faces are often &s;tained with a black, or a bright red, or a white colour, by way of ornament: this la&s;t gives them a gha&s;tly and di&s;gu&s;ting look. They al&s;o &s;trew the brown, martial <HI>mica</HI> on the paint, which makes it glitter. The ears of many of them are bored in the lobe, where they make a pretty large hole, and two others higher up on the outer edge. In the&s;e holes they hang bits of bone, or quills, fixed on a leather thong; &s;mall &s;hells; bunches of woollen ta&s;&s;els, or pieces of thin cop|per. The <HI>&s;eptum</HI> of the no&s;e, in many, is al&s;o perfo|rated, through which they draw a piece of &s;mall cord; and others wear in the &s;ame place, &s;mall, thin pieces of iron, bra&s;s or copper, &s;haped almo&s;t like a hor&s;hoe, the narrow opening of which receives the <HI>&s;eptum,</HI> &s;o that the two points may gently pinch it, and the ornament thus
<PB N="272" REF="283">
hangs over the upper lip. About their wri&s;ts, they wear bracelets, or bunches of white, bugle-beads, made of a conic, &s;helly &s;ub&s;tance; bunches of &s;trings with ta&s;&s;els, or a broad, black, &s;hining, heavy &s;ub&s;tance, of one piece: and about their ancles, they al&s;o wear frequently many &s;olds of leather-thongs, or the &s;inews of animals twi&s;ted to a con&s;iderable thickne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus far, their common dre&s;s; but they have others which they u&s;e on extraordinary occa&s;ions, on vi&s;its of ceremony, or when they go to war. For the fir&s;t, they make of the &s;kins of animals, trimmed at the edges, with broad borders of fur, or that woolen &s;tuff they make, embroidered with various figures, and tied on as the other garments, but over them. At &s;uch times, the ge|neral head-dre&s;s, is a quantity of withy, or half-beaten bark, wrapped about the head, &s;tuck with various, large eagle-feathers, or powdered, as it were, with &s;mall, white feathers. The face is then painted, with its upper and lower parts of different colours, in &s;tripes, &s;o that the &s;tripes &s;hall appear as bleeding ga&s;hes; or it &s;hall be &s;meared with a kind of tallow, mixed with paint, and formed into a variety of figures, re&s;embling carved-work. Some|times, again, they will divide their hair into &s;mall parcels, and tie it in intervals of two inches, to the end, with thread; and others will tie it behind, as we do, and &s;tick bunches of cypre&s;s in it. Thus dre&s;&s;ed, they will have a truly &s;avage and ridiculous appearance; but this is much heigh|tened, when they put on, what may be called their mon|&s;trous
<PB N="273" REF="284">
decorations. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t of an endle&s;s variety of carved, wooden ma&s;ks, or vizors, applied on the face, or upper-part of the head, or forehead. Some of the&s;e re&s;emble human faces, furni&s;hed with hair, beards, and eyebrows; others, the heads of eagles, and other birds; and many, the heads of wolves, deer, porpoi&s;es, and the like. In general, the&s;e repre&s;entations, much ex|ceed the natural &s;ize; and they are painted, and often &s;trewed with pieces of the foliaceous <HI>mica,</HI> which makes them glitter; and &s;eems to augment their enormous deformity. They even exceed this, &s;ometimes, and fix on the &s;ame part of the head, large pieces of carved-work, re&s;embling the prow of a canoe, pointed in the &s;ame manner; and projecting to a con&s;iderable length.</P>
<P>The only dre&s;s, among the people of Nootka, &s;eem|ingly adapted to war, is a thick, leather mantle, doubled; which, from its &s;ize, appears to be the &s;kin of an elk or buffalo, tanned. This they fa&s;ten on, in the common way; but &s;o as to reach up, over the brea&s;t quite to the throat; falling, at the &s;ame time, almo&s;t to the legs. It is &s;ome|times ingeniou&s;ly painted, in different compartments, like our herald's coats; and is &s;ufficiently &s;trong to re|&s;i&s;t arrows, and the points of &s;pears. On the &s;ame oc|ca&s;ion, they &s;ometimes wear a kind of leather-cloak, covered with rows of dried hoofs of deer, di&s;po&s;ed ho|rizontally, appended by leather-thongs, covered with quills; which, when they move, make a rattling noi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="285">Though the&s;e people cannot be viewed, without a kind of horror, when equipped in &s;uch extravagant dre&s;&s;es; yet, when dive&s;ted of them, and &s;een in their common habits, they have not the lea&s;t appearance of ferocity, but appear, on the contrary, as I have already ob&s;erved, to be of a quiet, phleghmatic and inactive di&s;po&s;ition; de&s;titute, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, of that degree of animation and vivacity, nece&s;&s;ary to render them agreeable.</P>
<P>Though not re&s;erved, they are far from being talkative: but their gravity is rather a con&s;equence of their natural di&s;po&s;ition, than any &s;en&s;e of propriety, or mode of education; for, when in the greate&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, they know not how to expre&s;s their anger, by any warmth of language or &s;ignificancy of ge&s;ture.</P>
<P>Their orations, which are made either when engaged in di&s;pute, or to explain their &s;entiments, on any public occa&s;ion, &s;eem little more than &s;hort &s;entences; or rather &s;ingle words, forcibly repeated, and con&s;tantly in one tone, and degree of &s;trength, accompanied only with a &s;ingle ge&s;ture, at every &s;entence, that of jerking their whole body a little forward, by bending the knee; their arms hanging li&s;tle&s;s by their &s;ides.</P>
<P>Though there is too much rea&s;on to infer, from their bringing human &s;kulls and bones to &s;ale, that they eat their enemies with a degree of brutal cruelty; this cir|cum&s;tance rather marks a general agreement of charac|ter,
<PB N="275" REF="286">
with that of almo&s;t every tribe of uncivilized men, in every age, and every part of the globe, than that they are to be reproached with peculiar inhumanity. They &s;eem to be a docile, courteous, good-natured people; yet quick in re&s;enting what they con&s;ider as an injury, but, like mo&s;t other pa&s;&s;ionate people, &s;oon forgeting it.</P>
<P>The chief employment of the men, &s;eems to be that of fi&s;hing, and killing land and &s;ea-animals, for the maintenance of their families; whereas the wo|men are generally employed in manufacturing their flaxen or under-garments; in preparing &s;ardines for drying, which they carry up from the beach, in large ba&s;kets, after the men have brought them in their canoes. The women are al&s;o &s;ent in &s;mall canoes to collect mu&s;cles, and other &s;hell-fi&s;h, and perhaps on &s;ome other occa&s;ions: for they manage the&s;e with as much dexterity as the men, who, when in the canoes with them, &s;eem to pay little attention to their &s;ex, by offering to relieve them from the labour of the paddle; nor indeed do they treat them with any parti|cular re&s;pect or tenderne&s;s in other &s;ituations. The young men appear to be the mo&s;t indolent, or idle of the whole community; for they were either &s;itting about in &s;cattered companies, to ba&s;k in the &s;un, or lay wallowing in the &s;and, on the beach, like a num|ber of hogs; without any covering. But, this di&s;re|gard to decency was confined to the men. The women were always properly cloathed, and behaved,
<PB N="276" REF="287">
with the utmo&s;t propriety, ju&s;tly di&s;erving all com|mendation, for a ba&s;hfulne&s;s and mode&s;ty becoming their &s;ex, and the more meritorious, as the men &s;eemed to have no &s;en&s;e of &s;hame.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es are di&s;po&s;ed in three ranges, or rows, ri&s;ing gradually behind each other, the large&s;t in front, the others le&s;s; be&s;ides a few, &s;traggling ones at each end. The&s;e ranges are interrupted or di&s;|joined at irregular di&s;tances, by narrow paths, or lanes that pa&s;s upward, but tho&s;e which run in a line with the hou&s;es, between the rows, are much broader. Though there is &s;ome appearance of regularity in their di&s;po&s;ition, there is none in the hou&s;es them&s;elves; for each building, divided by a path, let it be ever &s;o long, may be con&s;idered as one hou&s;e, or many; though there are no complete &s;eparations, either with|out, or within, to di&s;tingui&s;h them. They are built of very long and broad planks, re&s;ting upon the edges of each other, fa&s;tened or tied here and there, by withs of pine-bark, and having only &s;lender po&s;ts or rather poles at con&s;iderable di&s;tances on the out&s;ide, to which they are al&s;o tied; but within, are &s;ome, larger poles, placed a&s;lant. The height of the &s;ides, and ends, of the&s;e habitations, is &s;even or eight feet, but the back-part, is a little higher, by which means the planks, that compo&s;e the roof, &s;lant forwards, and are laid on loo&s;e, &s;o as to be moved about; either to put clo&s;e, in order to exclude the rain, or in fair weather
<PB N="277" REF="288">
to be &s;eparated to let in the light, or pa&s;s out the &s;moke. They are, however, upon the whole, mi&s;erable dwellings, and con&s;tructed with little care or ingenuity: for though the &s;ide-planks are made to fit pretty clo&s;ely together, in &s;ome places, in others, they are quite open; and they have no regular doors, the en|trance being either by a hole, where the unequal length of the planks has accidentally left an opening; or where, in &s;ome ca&s;es, the planks are made to lap over each other, and, thus being &s;hortened, leave a kind of door-way. Some holes are al&s;o left in the &s;ides, by way of windows, but without any regularity; and, the&s;e have bits of mat hung before them, to keep the rain out. The habitations further north, on this coa&s;t, where <HI>Bhering</HI> landed, in 1741, are very like tho&s;e of Nootka.</P>
<P>Within we may frequently &s;ee, from one end to the other of the&s;e ranges of buildings, without inter|mi&s;&s;ion; for though, in general, there are apartments on each &s;ide, for the accomodation of families, they are &s;uch as do not intercept the &s;ight, and often con|&s;i&s;t of no more than pieces of plank, running from the &s;ides, towards the middle of the hou&s;e; &s;o that if they were complete, the whole might be compared to a long &s;table, with a double range of &s;talls, and a broad pa&s;&s;age in the middle. Clo&s;e to the &s;ides, in each of the&s;e parts, is a little bench of boards, rai&s;ed five or &s;ix inches higher than the re&s;t of the floor,
<PB N="278" REF="289">
covered with matts, and on which the family &s;it and &s;leep. The&s;e benches are commonly &s;even or eight feet long, and four or five broad. In the middle of the floor, between them, is the fire-place, which has neither hearth nor chimney. In one hou&s;e which Captain <HI>Cook</HI> &s;aw, and which was at the end of a middle range, almo&s;t &s;eparated from the re&s;t, by a high, clo&s;e partition, their were four of the&s;e benches, each of which held a &s;ingle family at a corner, and the middle of the room appeared common to them all.</P>
<P>Their furniture con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of a great number of che&s;ts and boxes of all &s;izes, which are generally piled upon each other, clo&s;e to the door, or ends of the room or hou&s;e, and contain their &s;pare garments, &s;kins, ma&s;ks and other things, which they &s;et a value on; &s;ome of the&s;e are double, or one covers the other as a lid; others have a lid fa&s;tened with thongs, and &s;ome of the larger ones have a &s;quare hole in the upper part, by which the things are put in and taken out. They are often painted black, &s;tudded with the teeth of different animals, or carved with a kind of frieze-work, and figures of birds, or an|imals, by way of ornament. Their other, dome&s;tic uten&s;ils are mo&s;tly &s;quare and oblong pails or buckets to hold water, and other things, with wooden cups and bowls, and &s;mall, &s;hallow, wooden troughs, about
<PB N="279" REF="290">
two feet long, out of which they eat their food; and twig-ba&s;kets, bags of matting, &amp;c. Their fi&s;hing-imple|ments, and other things lie or hang up in different parts of the hou&s;e, but without the lea&s;t order; &s;o that the whole is a complete &s;cene of confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The na&s;tine&s;s and &s;tench of their hou&s;es, is equal to their complexion; for they dry their fi&s;h within doors; they al&s;o gut them there, which, with their bones and fragments thrown down at meals, and the addition of of other filth, lie about in heaps, and and are not cleared away, till &s;uch heaps become al|mo&s;t in&s;upportable. In a word, their hou&s;es are as filthy as hog-&s;tyes, every thing in and about them &s;tinking of fi&s;h, train-oil and &s;moke.</P>
<P>Filthy however as they are, many of them are de|corated with images. The&s;e are nothing more than the trunks of very large trees, four or five feet high, &s;et up &s;ingly, or by pairs, at the upper end of the apartment, with the front carved into a human face; the arms and hands cut out on the &s;ides, and vari|ou&s;ly painted; &s;o that the whole is truly a mon&s;trous figure. A net, by way of curtain, for the mo&s;t part, hangs before them, and it &s;eems at times, that they make offerings to them.</P>
<P>Though their food, may be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t, of every thing they can procure, either animal, or vege|table,
<PB N="280" REF="291">
the quantity of the latter, bears a very &s;mall proportion to the former. Their greate&s;t dependance is on what the &s;ea produces them. Their chief food is herrings, and &s;ardines; which, being dried and &s;moked, are &s;ewed up in matts, &s;o as to form bales, three or four feet &s;quare. They make al&s;o a kind of caviare of herring's roe, which is their winter|bread.</P>
<P>Large mu&s;cles they roa&s;t in the &s;hells; they are then &s;tuck on long &s;kewers, taken off occa&s;ionly, and eaten, dipping them in oil, as a &s;auce. Of &s;ea-animals, their mo&s;t common food is the porpoi&s;e, the fle&s;h of which they dry in pieces, as they do the herrings. They al&s;o make a kind of broth of it, by putting it fre&s;h, with water, into a boiler, and throwing heated &s;tones into it, till &s;ufficiently &s;eethed. They put in the fle&s;h, and take out the &s;tones with a cleft &s;tick, which &s;erves them for tongs. The oil the&s;e animals produce is &s;tored away, and often eat with a &s;poon. Of vegetables, they eat the leaves of the goo&s;eberry and currant, and al&s;o of the lily, without any pre|paration, and &s;ome few bulbous roots.</P>
<P>Their manner of eating is exactly con&s;onant to the na&s;tine&s;s of their hou&s;es, and per&s;ons, for the troughs and platters, in which they put their food, appear never to have been wa&s;hed, from the time they are fir&s;t made, and the dirty remains of a former meal are
<PB N="281" REF="292">
only &s;wept away by the &s;ucceeding one. They tear every thing &s;olid, or tough, to pieces, with their teeth; for, though they make u&s;e of knives, to cut up their animals, they never u&s;e them at their meals; and the roots which they dig, they will eat, without even &s;haking off the earth that adheres to them.</P>
<P><HI>Weapons.</HI> Their weapons are bows and arrows, &s;lings, &s;pears, &s;hort truncheons of &s;tone, and a &s;mall pick-axe, not unlike the common, American <HI>tomahawk.</HI> Their &s;pears have a long point of bone, but &s;ome of their arrows are pointed with iron. The tomahawk is a &s;tone, &s;ix or eight inches long, pointed at one end, and the other fixed into a wooden handle; which re&s;embles the human head and neck, the &s;tone fixed in the mouth, and repre&s;enting a large tongue, and to make the re&s;emblance &s;tronger, human hair is fixed to the head. This weapon they call <HI>taawee&s;h</HI> or <HI>t&s;u&s;keeah.</HI></P>
<P>Their number of &s;tone-weapons, and the great quantity of human &s;kulls, Captain <HI>Cook</HI> &s;aw, lead him to &s;uppo&s;e, that they have frequent wars among them, and that tho&s;e wars are bloody.</P>
<P><HI>Mu&s;ick.</HI> With re&s;pect to their manners and cu&s;|toms, we are able to &s;ay little of: they &s;eem to be fond of &s;inging, and to make it a part of their ce|remonies. When they approached our &s;hip, &s;ays
<PB N="282" REF="293">
Captain <HI>Cook,</HI> they all &s;tood up in their canoes and began to &s;ing; &s;ome of their &s;ongs, in which the whole body joined, were in a &s;low, and others in quicker time, and they accompanied their notes with the mo&s;t regular motions of their hands, or beating in concert, with their paddles, on the &s;ides of their canoes, and making other very expre&s;&s;ive ge&s;tures. At the end of each &s;ong, they remained &s;ilent a few &s;econds, and then began again, &s;ometimes pronouncing the word <HI>hooee!</HI> forcibly as a chorus.</P>
<P>They keep the exacte&s;t concert in their &s;ongs, which are often &s;ung by great numbers together, as tho&s;e already mentioned. The&s;e are &s;olemn and &s;low, but their mu&s;ic is not of that confined &s;ort found among&s;t many rude nations; for the variations are very numerous and expre&s;&s;ive, and the cadence or melody powerfully &s;oothing. Be&s;ides, their full concerts, &s;onnets of the &s;ame, grave ca&s;t, were frequently &s;ung by &s;ingle performers, who kept time, by &s;triking the hand again&s;t the thigh. The mu&s;ic, however, was &s;ome|times varied, from its predominant &s;olemnity of air, and there were in&s;tances of &s;tanzas being &s;ung in a more gay and lively &s;train, and even with a degree of humour.</P>
<P>The only in&s;truments of mu&s;ic &s;een, (if &s;uch they may be called) were a rattle, and a &s;mall whi&s;tle, about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n inch long, incapable of any variation, from having
<PB N="283" REF="294">
but one hole. They u&s;e the rattle when they &s;ing, and the whi&s;tle, when they dre&s;s them&s;elves like par|ticular animals, and endeavour to imitate their howl or cry. The whi&s;tles are made in the &s;hape of a bird, with a few pebbles in the belly, and the tail is the handle. They look more like a child's rattle.</P>
<P><HI>Canoes.</HI> Their canoes are of &s;imple &s;tructure, but apparently well calculated for every u&s;eful purpo&s;e; from the large&s;t, which carry 20 per&s;ons or more, are framed of one tree. Many of them are forty feet long, &s;even broad, and about three deep. From the middle, towards each end, they become gradually nar|rower, the after-part and &s;tern ending abruptly, or perpendicularly, with a &s;mall knob on the top; but the fore-part is lengthened out, &s;tretching forward and upward, ending in a notched point or prow, con&s;ider|ably higher than the &s;ides of the canoe, which run nearly in a &s;traight line. They are chiefly without ornaments, though &s;ome have little carved work, and are &s;tudded on the &s;ides with &s;eal's teeth, as are their ma&s;ks and weapons. A few have al&s;o a kind of ad|ditional prow, like a large cut-water, which is painted with the figure of &s;ome animal. They have no &s;eats, or other &s;upporters in the in&s;ide, than &s;everal, round &s;ticks, little thicker than a cane, placed acro&s;s, at mid-depth. They are very light, and their breadth and flatne&s;s, enables them to float firmly, without any

out-rigger, which none of them have; and which is a remarkable di&s;tinction, between the navigation, of all the American nations, and that of the &s;outh|ern parts of the Ea&s;t Indies, and the i&s;lands of the Pacific ocean. Their paddles are light, and &s;mall, &s;haped, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, like a large leaf, pointed at the bottom, broade&s;t in the middle, and gradually lo&s;ing it&s;elf in the &s;haft, the whole being about five feet long. They have acquired great dexterity, by con&s;tant u&s;e, in managing the&s;e paddles; for &s;ails are no part of their art, in navigation.</P>
<P>The canoes of the nations, in latitude 61&deg; N. lon|gitude 213&deg;, are not made with wood, as at Nootka, except the frame, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;lender laths. This is covered with the &s;kins of &s;eals, or &s;uch like animals.</P>
<P>The canoes of Prince William's &s;ound, are exactly the &s;ame with tho&s;e of Greenland, and the E&s;quimaux Indians, and their weapons and in&s;truments of fi&s;hing and hunting, are al&s;o the &s;ame; of cour&s;e, they need no de&s;cription.</P>
<P><HI>Implements.</HI> Their implements for fi&s;hing and hunt|ing, at Nootka, which are both ingeniou&s;ly contrived, and well made, are nets, hooks and lines, harpoons, gigs, and an in&s;trument like an oar. This la&s;t is twenty feet long, four or five inches broad, and about
<PB N="285" REF="296">
an inch thick. Each edge, for about two thirds of its length (the other third being its handle,) is &s;et with &s;harp bone-teeth, about two inches long. Herrings and &s;ardines, and &s;uch other, &s;mall fi&s;h, as come in &s;hoals, are attacked with this in&s;trument, which is pu&s;hed into the &s;hoal, and the fi&s;h are caught either upon or between the teeth. Their hooks are made of bone and wood, and rather clum&s;ily; but the harpoon with which they &s;trike the whale, and le&s;&s;er &s;ea-animals, &s;hews a great deal of contrivance. It is compo&s;ed of a piece of bone, on which is fixed the oval blade of a large mu&s;cle-&s;hell, in which is the point of the in&s;trument; to this is fa&s;tened about two or three fathoms of rope; and to throw this harpoon, they u&s;e a &s;haft of about 12 or 15 feet long to which the line or rope is made fa&s;t, and to the end of which the harpoon is fixed, &s;o as to &s;eparate from the &s;haft, and leave it floating on the water, as a buoy, when the animal darts away with the harpoon.</P>
<P>Their fi&s;hing wears, are compo&s;ed of pieces of wicker-work, made of &s;mall rods, &s;ome clo&s;er than others, according to the &s;ize of the fi&s;h intended to be caught in them. The&s;e pieces of wicker-work, (&s;ome of who&s;e &s;uperficies are at lea&s;t 20 feet by 12) are fixed up edgeways in &s;hallow water, by &s;trong poles or pickets, that &s;tand firm in the ground. How they were u&s;ed, Captain <HI>Cook,</HI> cannot &s;ay, as he &s;aw no one attending them; but it is apprehended they
<PB N="286" REF="297">
may be erected for the purpo&s;e of enclo&s;ing fi&s;h in the manner I have repre&s;ented that the Co&s;&s;acks u&s;e them, in Siberia.</P>
<P>Every thing of the rope-kind, is made from thongs of &s;kins, and &s;inews of animals, or from the &s;ame flaxen &s;ub&s;tance of which their mantles are manu|factured.</P>
<P>Their great dexterity in wood-work, may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be attributed to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they receive from iron tools, &s;uch as chi&s;&s;els and knives; a &s;tone &s;erves them for a mallet, and a piece of fi&s;h-&s;kin for a poli&s;her. Their knives are of various &s;izes; &s;ome very large and their blades are crooked, re&s;embling our pruning knife, but the cutting edge in the back or convex part. They &s;harpen their tools, on a coar&s;e &s;late, whet-&s;tone, and keep them con&s;tantly bright.</P>
<P><HI>Manufactures,</HI> &amp;c. Their manufactures and mechanic arts, are far more exten&s;ive, and ingenious, whether we regard the de&s;ign, or the execution, then could have been expected from the natural di&s;po&s;ition of the peo|ple, and the little progre&s;s that cultivation has made among them. The flaxen and woollen garments, with which they cover them&s;elves, are their fir&s;t care, and the chief object of their attention; the former of the&s;e are made of pine-tree bark, beaten into hemp. It is not &s;pun; but, after being properly prepared, is
<PB N="287" REF="298">
&s;pread upon a &s;tick which is fa&s;tened acro&s;s, to two others that &s;tand upright. It is di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, that the manufacturer, who &s;its on her hams, at this &s;imple machine, knits it acro&s;s, with &s;mall plaited threads, at the di&s;tance of half an inch from each other; though by this method, it is not &s;o clo&s;e or firm, as cloth that is woven, the bunches, be|tween the knots, fill up the inter&s;tices and form it into a compleat cloth; and it has the advantage of being &s;ofter and more pliable. Their woollen gar|ments, are very like woven cloth, and the various figures, which are artificially in&s;erted in them, de&s;troy the &s;uppo&s;ition of their being wrought in a loom. Probably they are made, as we have &s;hewn that the Tartars make their felts. They are of different de|grees of finene&s;s, &s;ome re&s;embling our coar&s;e rugs or blankets, and others almo&s;t equal to our fine&s;t &s;orts, even &s;ofter, and certainly warmer. The wool or fur &s;eems to be that of the fox, and brown lynx, and the orna|mental parts or figures in the&s;e garments, which are di&s;po&s;ed with great ta&s;te, are commonly of different colours, being dyed chiefly of a deep brown, or of a yellow; the la&s;t of which when new, equals in brightne&s;s that in the be&s;t of our carpets.</P>
<P>To their ta&s;te or de&s;ign, in working figures on their garments, corre&s;ponds their fondne&s;s for carving on every thing they make of wood. Nothing is without a kind of frieze-work, or the figure of
<PB N="288" REF="299">
&s;ome animal upon it; but the mo&s;t general repre&s;en|tation, is that of the human face, which, is often cut out upon birds, and on their &s;tone and bone-wea|pons. The general de&s;ign of all the&s;e things is &s;ufficient to convey a knowledge of the object they are intended to repre&s;ent; but the carving is not ex|ecuted with that nicety, that an ingenious arti&s;t would be&s;tow even on an indifferent de&s;ign. Indeed, in many of their ma&s;ks, and vizors, they &s;hew them&s;elves able &s;culptors, not only pre&s;erving, with great exactne&s;s, the general character of their own faces, but fini&s;hing the more minute parts with a degree of accuracy in pro|portion, and neatne&s;s in execution. The &s;trong pro|pen&s;ity of the&s;e people to works of this &s;ort is re|markable in a great variety of particulars. Small, whole human figures, repre&s;entations of birds, fi&s;h, land and &s;ea, animals, models of their hou&s;hold-uten&s;ils, and of their canoes, are found among&s;t them, in great abundance.</P>
<P>The imitative arts being nearly allied, it is no wonder they &s;hould be as good de&s;igners, as carvers. The whole proce&s;s of their whale-fi&s;hery, is often &s;een painted, on the caps they wear; this, though rudely executed, &s;erves at lea&s;t to &s;hew, that though there is no appearance among&s;t them of a knowledge of letters, they have &s;ome notions of commemorating and repre&s;enting actions, independant of their &s;ongs and traditions.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="300">Their manner of &s;moke-drying fi&s;h, is as follows: they fir&s;t hang them within their huts, on &s;mall rods, about a foot from the fire; afterwards, they remove them higher and higher, to make room for others, till the rods, on which the fir&s;t hang, reach the top of the hou&s;e; when completely dried, they are taken down, packed clo&s;e in bales, and covered with matts till they are wanted. Cod and other large fi&s;h are al&s;o cured in the &s;ame manner, though they &s;ometimes dry them in the open air, without fire.</P>
<P>In trafficking, they betray a knavi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, and would carry off the goods they wanted, without making any return; and yet were unwilling to let any gra&s;s be cut, without it was fir&s;t paid for. The inha|bitants of Nootka, are thieves in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, for they would pilfer nothing but what they thought would be u&s;eful to them&s;elves; and Captain <HI>Cook</HI> had rea&s;on to apprehend that &s;tealing is much practi&s;ed among them, and chiefly gave ri&s;e to their quarrels.</P>
<P>The beads, iron, and copper found among&s;t the&s;e people, leave it beyond a doubt, that they mu&s;t have procured them, through an interview with the more inland tribes, from Hud&s;ons bay, or the &s;ettlements on the Canadian lakes; unle&s;s it can be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Ru&s;&s;ian Indians from Kamt&s;chatka (which is le&s;s likely) have extended their habitations further than
<PB N="290" REF="301">
the nations of the Ea&s;tern i&s;lands, communicating along the coa&s;t, with tho&s;e of Prince William's Sound.</P>
<P>Of the political and religious in&s;titutions, we can &s;ay but little; Captain <HI>Cook</HI> could only ob&s;erve, that there are &s;uch men as chiefs among&s;t them, called <HI>Acweek,</HI> and to whom the others, are in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ubordinate; but it appeared that the authority of the&s;e chiefs, extended no farther than to the family to which each chief belongs; and who own him for their head. As the&s;e <HI>Acweeks,</HI> are not all elderly men, it is concluded, that the title comes to them by inhe|ritance. Of their religion, nothing of any moment could be collected.</P>
<P><HI>Language.</HI> Their language is by no means har&s;h or di&s;agreeable, further than what proceeds from their u&s;ing the <HI>k</HI> and <HI>h</HI> with more force, or pronouncing them with le&s;s &s;oftne&s;s than we do; and on the whole it abounds, rather with what we may call labral and dental, than with guttural &s;ounds; &s;o that it may be compared to a very coar&s;e or har&s;h method of li&s;ping. It is difficult to repre&s;ent this &s;ound, by any com|bination of our own letters, unle&s;s, by <HI>I&s;zthl.</HI> This is one of their u&s;ual terminations, though it &s;ometimes
<PB N="291" REF="302">
begins a word. The next mo&s;t general termination is <HI>tl,</HI> and many words end with <HI>z</HI> and <HI>&s;s,</HI> as for example,

<P>They &s;eem to take &s;o great a latitude in their mode of &s;peaking, that they have &s;ometimes four or five different terminations of the &s;ame word.

<P><PB N="292" REF="303">Where I to affix a name, &s;ays Captain <HI>Cook,</HI> to the people of Nootka, as a di&s;tinct nation, I would call them <HI>Waka&s;&s;ians,</HI> from the word <HI>Waka&s;h,</HI> which is fre|quently in their mouths. It &s;eems to expre&s;s applau&s;e, approbation, or friend&s;hip; for when they appeared to be &s;atisfied or well plea&s;ed with any thing they &s;aw, or any accident that happened, they would, with one voice, call out <HI>waka&s;h! waka&s;h!</HI> In &s;hort, &s;o e&s;&s;entially do they differ in their per&s;ons, their cu&s;toms and lan|guage, from the inhabitants of the I&s;lands in the Pacific ocean, that we cannot &s;uppo&s;e their re&s;pective progenitors to have been united in the &s;ame tribe, or to have had any intimate connection, when they emigrated from their original &s;ettlements, into the place where we now find their de&s;cendants.</P>
<P>The common dre&s;s of the natives of Prince William's Sound (for men, women, and children), is a kind of clo&s;e frock, reaching generally to the ancles, though &s;ometimes only to the knees. At the upper part is a hole, ju&s;t &s;ufficient to admit the head; with &s;leeves to the wri&s;t. Their frocks are made of the &s;kins of different animals, the hairy &s;ide outwards: &s;ome have their frocks made of the &s;kins of fowls, with the down only remaining on them. The &s;eams of the&s;e garments are ornamented with ta&s;&s;els, or a fringe of narrow thongs; and a few, have a kind of cape or collar, and &s;ome a hood. When it rains, they put over this, another frock,
<PB N="293" REF="304">
ingeniou&s;ly made from the inte&s;tines of whales, &s;o thin, and well prepared, as to re&s;emble our gold-beater's &s;kin: this is made to draw tight round the neck, and at the wri&s;ts; and its &s;kirts, when they are in their canoes, are &s;o drawn over the brim of the hole in which they &s;it, that no water can enter.</P>
<P>They generally go naked-legged; but &s;ome few have a kind of &s;kin &s;tockings, reaching half way up the thigh; and &s;carce any appear without mittens for the hands, made of the &s;kins of bears-paws. Tho&s;e who wear any thing on the head, re&s;emble tho&s;e at Nootka; having high, truncated, conic caps of &s;traw, and &s;ometimes of wood, re&s;embling a &s;eal's head, well painted.</P>
<P>The men commonly wear the hair cropt round the neck and forehead; but the women allow it to grow long, and mo&s;t of them tie a &s;mall lock of it on the crown; and a few club it behind, after our manner. Both &s;exes have their ears perforated with &s;everal holes, about the outer and lower part of the edge, in which they hang little bunches of beads. The <HI>&s;eptum</HI> of their no&s;es they al&s;o bore, and thru&s;t thro' it, the quill-feathers of &s;mall birds; or little, bending ornaments, made of a &s;helly &s;ub&s;tance, &s;trung on a &s;tiff &s;tring, or cord, three or four inches long, which gives them a truly picture&s;que appearance. But the mo&s;t uncommon and un&s;ightly fa&s;hion, adopted by
<PB N="294" REF="305">
both &s;exes, is that of &s;litting, or cutting the under-lip, quite through, in the direction of the mouth, a little below the &s;welling part: this in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, which is made even in &s;ucking children, is often above two inches long; and either by its natural retraction, when the wound i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fre&s;h, or by the repetition of &s;ome contrivance, a&s;&s;umes the true &s;hape of lips, and &s;eems &s;o large, as to admit the tongue through; &s;o that they &s;eem to have two mouths. In this artificial mouth, they &s;tick a flat, narrow ornament, of &s;olid &s;hell, or bone, cut into little narrow pieces, like &s;mall teeth, almo&s;t down to the ba&s;e, or thicke&s;t part, which has a &s;mall, projecting bit at each end, to &s;upport it, when put into the divided lip; the cut part then ap|pearing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">wards. Others have the lower lip only per|formed into &s;eparate holes; and then the ornament con|&s;i&s;t, of as many di&s;tinct &s;tuds; when the points are pu&s;h|ed through the&s;e holes, and their heads appear within the lip, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> another row of teeth, immediately under their own.</P>
<P>The&s;e are their native ornaments: but Captain <HI>Cook,</HI> found many b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d among them, of European manufac|ture, chiefly of a pale, blue colour, which they hang in their ears, about their caps, or join to their lip-orna|ments, which have a &s;mall hole drilled in each point, to which they are fa&s;tened, and others to them, till they hang &s;ometimes as low as the point of the chin. But in this la&s;t ca&s;e, they cannot remove them &s;o ea&s;ily; but as
<PB N="295" REF="306">
to their own lip-ornaments, they can take them out with their tongue, or &s;uck them into the mouth at plea&s;ure. They al&s;o wear bracelets, of &s;helly beads, or of a &s;ub|&s;tance like amber.</P>
<P>The men frequently paint their faces of a bright red, and of a black colour; and &s;ometimes of a blue, or lead-colour, but not in any regular figure; and the women, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, endeavour to imitate them, by punc|turing or &s;taining the chin with black, that comes to a point on each cheek; a practice, &s;ays <HI>Crantz,</HI> very &s;imi|lar to one in fa&s;hion among the females in Greenland. They do not paint their bodies, &s;ays <HI>Cook,</HI> but I no where ever &s;aw &s;avages, who took more pains to ornament, or rather to disfigure their per&s;ons.</P>
<P>For defen&s;ive armour, they have a kind of jacket, or coat of mail, made of thin laths, bound together with &s;inews; which makes it quite flexible, tho' &s;o clo&s;e, as not to admit an arrow or dart: it only covers the trunk of the body, and may not be improperly compared to a woman's &s;tays.</P>
<P>Of their dome&s;tic uten&s;ils, they have round, &s;hallow, wooden di&s;hes; and others of a cylindrical &s;hape, much deeper; the &s;ides being made of one piece, bent round, like our chip-boxes, though thick, neatly fa&s;tened with thongs, and the bottoms fixed in, with &s;mall wooden pegs.
<PB N="296" REF="307">
Others they have &s;maller, and of a more elegant &s;hape, &s;omewhat re&s;embling a large butter-boat, without a handle, but more &s;hallow; made from a piece of wood, or heavy &s;tub&s;tance, neatly carved; and they have many little &s;quare bags, much of the &s;ame &s;ort with their outer-frocks, neatly ornamented with very minute red feathers, interwoven with it; al&s;o, many chequered ba&s;|kets, wrought &s;o clo&s;e, as to hold water; &s;ome wooden-models of their canoes; many little images, four or five inches long, cut in wood, or &s;tuffed, cloathed in fur, and ornamented as they do them&s;elves; a kind of dolls. And, as a &s;ub&s;titute for the rattling-bird of Nootka, they have two or three hoops, or concentric pieces of wood, with a cro&s;s-bar fixed in the middle, to hold them by: to the&s;e are fixed a great number of dried barnacle-&s;hells, with threads, which &s;erve as a rattle, and make a loud noi&s;e, when they &s;hake them.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Cook</HI> could not &s;peak, with any deci&s;ion, of their tools; but he &s;aw a kind of &s;tone adze, many iron knives, &s;ome &s;traight, others crooked; and &s;ome very &s;mall ones, fixed in pretty long handles, with the blades bent upwards, like &s;ome of our &s;hoemaker's in&s;truments. They have &s;till knives of another &s;ort, near two foot long, &s;haped like a dagger, with a ridge in the middle. The&s;e they wear in &s;heaths of &s;kins, hung by a thong round the neck, under their frock, and u&s;ed only as weapons. Every thing they have, however, is as ingeniou&s;ly made,
<PB N="297" REF="308">
as if they were furni&s;hed with a complete tool-che&s;t; and their &s;ewing, plaiting of &s;inews, and &s;mall work, on their little bags, may be put in competition with the mo&s;t de|licate manufactures, found in any part of the known world. In &s;hort, con&s;idering the otherwi&s;e uncivilized, or rude &s;tate, in which the&s;e people are, their northern &s;ituation, amid&s;t a country perpetually covered with &s;now, and the wretched materials they have to work with, it ap|pears that their invention and dexterity, in all manual works, is at lea&s;t, equal to that of any other nation.</P>
<P>The food they were &s;een to eat, was dried-fi&s;h, and the fle&s;h of &s;ome animal, either broiled or roa&s;ted. They eat al&s;o the larger &s;ort of fern-root, mentioned at Nootka, Their drink is water; and they &s;wallow lumps of &s;now, by mouthfuls. They are decent and cleanly in their food; and though they &s;ometimes eat the raw fat of &s;ome &s;ea-animal, they cut it carefully into &s;mall pieces with their knives. They are al&s;o cleanly in their per&s;ons, and in all their uten&s;ils.</P>
<P>Their language, from the various &s;ignification their words bear, is at fir&s;t difficult to be under&s;tood; and &s;eems to have no affinity with that &s;poken at Nootka, except the word <HI>Aka&s;hou?</HI> which implies, <HI>What is the name of that?</HI> and is the &s;ame, at both places.</P>

<P>At Norton-Sound, in latitude 64&deg;. 55&prime;. and 197&deg;. 13&prime;. longitude, the dre&s;s of the natives is much the &s;ame as at Prince William's-Sound; only that here, they wear wide boots, and deer-&s;kin frocks, with large hoods, in which the women carry their children, as do the E&s;kimauxs and Greenlanders. The women which Captain <HI>Cook</HI> &s;aw, are &s;hort and &s;quat, with plump, round faces, punctured from the lip to the chin; their complexion a light cop|per-colour, black and &s;hort hair; the men with little beards; and both &s;exes have black teeth, &s;eemingly filed down level with the gums.</P>
<P>The dwellings of the&s;e people, were &s;eated clo&s;e to the beach, and con&s;i&s;ted &s;imply of a &s;loping roof, with|out any &s;ide-walls, compo&s;ed of logs, and covered with gra&s;s and earth. The floor laid with logs; the entrance

<P>The view given, is Snug-Corner-Cove, in Nootka-Sound, where Captain <HI>Cook</HI> anchored.</P>
<P><HI>Francis Maurelle,</HI> a Spaniard, who traced the Ameri|can coa&s;t northward, from the coa&s;t of California, in 1775, tells us, that in latitude 41&deg;. 7&prime;. which is about nine degrees more to the &s;outhward, than Nootka-Sound, where Captain <HI>Cook</HI> anchored, the men wear no covering, except the cold is inten&s;e; when they throw over their &s;houlders the &s;kins of animals, binding their heads with garlands of &s;weet-&s;melling herbs. They likewi&s;e wear their hair either di&s;hevelled over their &s;houlders, or as the Spani|ards &s;ay, <HI>en ca&s;tanna;</HI> that is, &s;o as to re&s;emble a che&s;nut-tree. In the &s;laps of their ears, they have rings, like tho&s;e the Spaniards have at the end of their mu&s;quets. They paint their faces, and the greater part of their bo|dies, with a black or blue colour; and puncture their arms in circles, as the common people in Spain, often paint &s;hips and anchors. They bind their loins and legs quite down to the ancles, very clo&s;ely, with &s;trips of hide or thread.</P>
<P>The women cover the tops of their heads with an ornament, like the cre&s;t of a helmet, and wear their hair in two tre&s;&s;es, in which they &s;tick many &s;weet-&s;mell|ing
<PB N="300" REF="312">
herbs. They al&s;o u&s;e the &s;ame rings in their caps (which are of bone) as the men do in their ears, and cover their bodies with the &s;ame &s;kins; be&s;ides which, they wear an apron of the &s;ame kind, about a foot wide, with &s;ome thread formed into a fringe. They likewi&s;e bind their legs, in the &s;ame manner as the men.</P>
<P>The under-lip of the women is &s;welled out into three <HI>fa&s;cias,</HI> or ri&s;ings; two of which i&s;&s;ue from the corners of the mouth, to the lowe&s;t part of what would be the beard in men, and the third, from the highe&s;t point, and middle of that point to the lower, like the others; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This de&s;cription is rather unintelligible, but we are not mi&s;taken in the tran&s;lation.</NOTE> leaving between each, a &s;pace of clear fle&s;h, which is much larger in young women than in old, who&s;e faces are generally punctured or tattooed, &s;o as to be totally disfigured. A ma&s;k of &s;uch a face may be &s;een in the Leverian Mu&s;eum, London.</P>
<P>On their necks they wear various fruits or &s;eeds, in|&s;tead of beads. Some other ornaments al&s;o con&s;i&s;t of the bones of animals, or &s;hells from the &s;ea-coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es are &s;quare, and built with large beams; the roof being no higher than the &s;urface of the ground;
<PB N="301" REF="313">
for doors to which, they make u&s;e of a circular hole, ju&s;t large enough to pa&s;s through<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Similar, we apprehend, to Kamt&s;chatka dwellings.</NOTE>. The floors of the&s;e huts are perfectly &s;mooth and clean, with a &s;quare hole, two feet deep, in the centre, in which they make their fire, and round which they are continually warming them|&s;elves in cold weather. Such habitations al&s;o &s;ecure them, when not employed out of doors, from the wind and noxious animals. This &s;imilarity of hut or hou&s;e, to tho&s;e of the natives in higher latitudes, and further we&s;t, is another argument of the north-we&s;tern coa&s;t of America being originally peopled from the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>This tribe of Indians is governed by a ruler, who directs where they &s;hall hunt and fi&s;h for what the community &s;tands in need of; and it &s;eems that the authority of this ruler, is confined to a particular village of the&s;e habitations; together with &s;uch a di&s;trict of country, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to the inhabitants of &s;uch a community; who &s;ometimes are at war with the villages.</P>
<P>They are very early taught the u&s;e of a bow; for, &s;ays this author, we ob&s;erved an infant, who could &s;carcely be a year old, &s;hooting arrows from a bow, propor|tioned to &s;ize, and &s;trength; and, who hit the hand at two or three yards di&s;tance, if held up for a mark.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="314">We never ob&s;erved that the&s;e Indians had any idols, or made &s;acrifices; but, as we found out, that they had a plurality of wives, or women at lea&s;t, we in|ferred, with good rea&s;on, that they were perfect athei&s;ts.</P>
<P>On the death of one of the&s;e Indians, they rai&s;ed a &s;ort of funeral cry, and afterwards interred the body within the hou&s;e of their ruler; but from this we could not pronounce that they were idolaters, becau&s;e the cry of lamentation, might proceed from affliction, and the body might have been burnt, that the corp&s;e might not be expo&s;ed to wild bea&s;ts, or to avoid the &s;tench ari&s;ing from putrefaction.</P>
<P>We could not under&s;tand their language, but they pronounced the Spani&s;h, with great ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Their arms are chiefly arrows pointed with flint, and &s;ome of them with iron or copper, which we under&s;tood were procured from the north, probably bartered at the Engli&s;h forts in Hud&s;ons bay, or with the travel|ing hords of Indians, who re&s;ort there at &s;tated times. Such arms are to be &s;een at the Leverian mu|&s;eum, London; brought from King George's Sound, on the N. W. coa&s;t of America, latitude 50&deg; by Captain <HI>Cook.</HI> At this mu&s;eum is al&s;o a bow, from &s;ome
<PB N="303" REF="315">
place re&s;embling one from the Labrador coa&s;t. The&s;e arrows are carried in quivers of wood or bone, and hang from their wri&s;t or neck.</P>
<P>What they mo&s;t value is iron, and particularly knives, or hoops of old barrels. They are accu&s;tomed to tobacco, which they &s;moked in &s;mall, wooden pipes, in form of a trumpet, and procured from little gardens, where they had planted it.</P>
<P>They chiefly hunt deer, cibulos, &s;ea-wolves, and otters. The only birds met with on this part of the coa&s;t, were daws, hawks, very &s;mall paroquets, ducks, and gulls; there were al&s;o &s;ome parrots, with red feet, bills and heads, like lories, both in their heads and flight.</P>
<P>The fi&s;h, on this coa&s;t, are chiefly &s;ardines and cod, and what this voyager calls <HI>pejerey;</HI> of which, they bring home only as much as will &s;atisfy the wants of the day.</P>
<P>We could not learn, continues <HI>Maurelle,</HI> whether the&s;e people had ever been vi&s;ited by any other &s;hips than ours. Indeed, we had every rea&s;on to think they had not; but what we &s;aw of the country, leaves no doubt of its fertility, and that it is capable of producing all the plants of Europe. In mo&s;t of the
<PB N="304" REF="316">
gullies of the hills, were rills of clear and cool water, the banks of which were covered with herbs (as in the meadows of Europe) of both agreeable verdure and fragrancy. Among the&s;e are Ca&s;tillian ro&s;es, &s;mallage, lilies, plan|tain, thi&s;tles, cammomile and many others. We al&s;o found &s;trawberries, ra&s;berries, blackberries, &s;weet onions, and potatoes, all which grew in great abundance, and particularly neare&s;t the rills.</P>
<P>The hills were covered with very large, high, and &s;trait pines &s;ome of which we noticed were 120 feet high, and four in diameter towards the bottom; pines proper for ma&s;ts and &s;hip-building. The tides here are as regular as in Europe.</P>
<P><HI>Maurelle</HI> traced the coa&s;t northward, as far as la|titude 57&deg;, 18&prime; found the appearance of the country &s;imilar to that of latitude 41&deg; and the natives dre&s;&s;ed as their more &s;outhern neighbours, only that their garments were longer, and they wore a cap on their hair, which covered their whole head. The weather here, in July, was exceedingly cold, with much rain and fro&s;t; but in latitude 56&deg; the air was much warmer, owing to &s;ome large volcanos burning in that neighbourhood, and which Captain <HI>Cook</HI> al&s;o mentions, and which we have de&s;cribed, in the plate of the natives of Nootka Sound.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="317">Thus has the North-We&s;tern Coa&s;t of America, been traced from California, to Bherings-Streights, by <HI>Mau|relle</HI> and <HI>Cook,</HI> and no inlet di&s;covered, to rai&s;e hopes of a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age, by Hud&s;on's-Bay, unle&s;s it be above the latitude 72&deg;. where the &s;eas are ob&s;tructed by large bodies of floating ice, in &s;ummer-time; but if a navigator could get into this latitude before June, it is generally thought, that the ocean, between the latitudes 80 and 90, is quite open, and that in all likelihood, land and inhabitants might be found within 10 degrees of the pole. But though our government has long held out a reward of 5000l. to the fir&s;t per&s;on that &s;hall &s;ail within a degree of the Pole; and &pound;.20,000, to the fir&s;t di&s;coverer of a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age by Hud&s;ons-bay, or north of it; yet, as it is the Greenland fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els only, that &s;ail &s;o far north, and the&s;e ve&s;&s;els lo&s;e their in&s;urance, if they pre&s;ume to go further than a certain latitude, the intere&s;t of their owners militates again&s;t the encouragement held out by parliament; and till the&s;e two intere&s;ts can be reconciled, there is little hopes of &s;uch a di&s;covery.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF SWEDEN, From <HI>Bu&s;ching, Motraye, Coxe, Mar&s;hal, Wraxhall, Con&s;et,</HI> and others.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>SWEDEN, part of the ancient Scandinavia, fa|mous for being the native country of the fierce and warlike Goths, who&s;e emigrations make &s;uch a figure in hi&s;tory, is bounded by Norwegian Lapland on the north, by the dominions of Ru&s;&s;ia on the ea&s;t, by the Baltic Sea on the &s;outh, and by Denmark and Norway on the we&s;t. It is about 250 Swedi&s;h miles
<PB N="308" REF="319">
in length,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One Swedi&s;h mile, is equal to &s;ix Engli&s;h ones.</NOTE> and 130 broad, that is extending from the 56th to the 69th degree of north latitude; and from the 10th to the 30th degree of longitude, reckoning from the meridian of London. But, within the&s;e bounds is included the province of Finland, which the Ru&s;&s;ians are now contending for. It was originally divided into &s;even provinces, 1. Sweden proper; 2. Gothland; 3. Livonia; 4. Ingria; 5. Finland; 6. Swedi&s;h Lapland; and 7. the I&s;lands; but is now reduced to five, Livonia and Ingria, being taken from them by the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>Va&s;t tracts of this country are taken up by de&s;arts and lakes, &s;o that the habitable part is confined to narrow bounds. The face of the country is pretty &s;imilar to that of its neighbours, only that it has the advantage of navigable rivers; the large&s;t of which are 1. the Motala&s;trom, which i&s;&s;ues from the Wetter lake, and being increa&s;ed by &s;eventeen rivers, forms a wa|ter-fall of &s;ixteen feet near Nordkioping, emptying it|&s;elf into the Baltic; 2. the Stang which divides Ea&s;t-Gothland into two parts; 3. the Gothic river, which ri&s;es in the Wener lake, falls into the North Sea near Gottenburg, forming a &s;teep cataract in its way; 4. the Gull&s;pang, dividing We&s;t Gothland from Wener|land; and 5. the Dal-Elbe in the vale-country, which is the large&s;t in all Sweden.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="320">The water-fall of Trolhatta is a &s;tupendous cataract in the Gothic river, almo&s;t &s;even and a half Swedi&s;h miles from its mouth; and the water is here preci|pitated between two rocks, and con&s;i&s;ts of three ca&s;|cades, each of which is above five fathoms high, but 300 fathoms from each other. Half a mile from one of the&s;e falls is a bridge, built from one rock to another; over another high cataract formed by this water, at the bottom of which great numbers of fine &s;almon are caught. The&s;e two cataracts make a fine appear|ance.</P>
<P>In one place &s;ays <HI>Con&s;et</HI> it falls over a rock 60 feet high, with &s;uch a noi&s;e, that it is heard at the di&s;tance of 200 furlongs. The timber that is floated down this river to Gottenburg, falls over this pre|cipice with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that it di&s;appears for a con&s;iderable time, before it ri&s;es again; and the bed of the river, into which this cataract falls, has been &s;ound|ed by lines of &s;everal hundred fathoms, but could never be reached.</P>
<P>The cataract of the river <HI>Dahl,</HI> which ri&s;es in Nor|wegian Lapland, and pa&s;&s;ing through a va&s;t extent of country, empties it&s;elf into the gulph of Bothnia, is one of tho&s;e objects, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Wraxhall,</HI> which to be felt, mu&s;t be &s;een, and before which all language &s;inks unequal. A &s;mall i&s;land or rather a rock of half a quarter a mile in circumference, divides the river at
<PB N="310" REF="321">
this place. In the winter, when one of the cataracts is frozen over, the i&s;land is acce&s;&s;ible, but at other times, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to reach it alive. The eye takes in both falls at once, from either bank. The depth of each is about forty feet, but one is a direct perpendicular, the other oblique and &s;helving; the breadth of each about ninety yards. The tremen|dous roar of the&s;e cataracts, which, clo&s;e to them, is greater far than the loude&s;t thunder, the &s;pray which ri&s;es ince&s;&s;antly from them, and even in many parts ob&s;cures them from the eye; the agitation of the river, below, for &s;everal hundred yards, before it re|&s;umes its former tranquility, and the &s;ides covered with tall firs, which &s;eem to be &s;ilent &s;pectators of it, form one of the mo&s;t picture&s;que and a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cenes to be beheld in nature's volume, nor would I have re&s;igned the plea&s;ure I experienced, as I lay on the loo&s;e &s;tones immediately below it, and was cover|ed with the &s;pray from its da&s;hing billows, for the mo&s;t voluptuous banquet a &s;overeign could be&s;tow. Incautious fi&s;hermen are &s;ometimes carried down the torrent, hurled on this precipice, and meet their death below.</P>
<P>Sweden, though a very mountainous country, affords a great many tracts of even ground, fit for agricul|ture. The &s;oil, in general, is &s;andy, &s;wampy, or ferruginous, but is not void of fertility. Of all the pro|vinces, Gothland produces the greate&s;t quantity of grain.
<PB N="311" REF="322">
This part of the country, had anciently its own &s;ove|reign, but was united to Sweden, in 1132. Sweden al&s;o affords good pa&s;tures, and &s;ome orchards of fine fruit, but is more famous for mines, than for any other thing. In Thal-lande, or the vale-land, there is le&s;s arable ground, than in the other provinces; but &s;ome, good meadows and pa&s;tures. The Nordlands, being full of rocks and mountains, produce but little corn, yet have &s;ome, fertile &s;pots for grazing. Lap|land is &s;till more in this predicament, but Finland is in mo&s;t places very fertile, though it is far from be|ing well cultivated.</P>
<P>Finland, which was the country of the Vandals, was, al&s;o formerly, governed by &s;overeigns of its own, and, at pre&s;ent, has the title of a great Duchy; it contains about 3000 &s;quare Swedi&s;h miles, but is not &s;ufficiently peopled, in proportion to its extent; which would &s;ub&s;i&s;t three millions of labouring hands well; whereas its population does not amount to one million.</P>
<P>The climate of Sweden is very healthful; the win|ters are extremely cold, and continue nine months in the year, but the air is clear and &s;alubrious, and the inhabitants arm them&s;elves again&s;t it with furs, &s;heep|&s;kins, &amp;c. which they wear as they can afford. <HI>Wraxhall</HI> who was there in May, &s;ays, it was as cold as in our December. But, as the winters approach with but little intervention of autumn, &s;o they de|part
<PB N="312" REF="323">
&s;uddenly, without &s;uch a gradation of &s;pring, as we experience in England. As &s;oon as the &s;un has thoroughly thawed the land, it is in order for tillage. The power of the &s;un &s;ucceeding the winter's fro&s;t, with once ploughing, &s;ets all the weeds loo&s;e; &s;o that it is nece&s;&s;ary to plough the land, at the end of the &s;ummer, before the fro&s;t &s;ets in; which, in this ca&s;e, will naturally de&s;troy the weeds, and make the ground clean; an experiment worth the trial with us, though our climate will favour a &s;pring-ploughing.</P>
<P>At Stockholm, the &s;un, in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, is eighteen hours and a half above the horizon, and, for &s;ome weeks, makes a continual day. In winter, the days are proportionably &s;horter, the &s;un being up but five hours and a half, which defect is &s;o well &s;upplied, as to light, by the moon, the <HI>aurora-borealis,</HI> the whitene&s;s of the &s;now, clearne&s;s of the &s;ky, and the brilliancy of the &s;tars, that travelling by night, is as u&s;ual as by day, and journeys are begun in the evening, as frequently as in the morning. Not to mention the twilight, which, in the north, begins four or five hours before &s;un-ri&s;e, and la&s;ts as long after &s;un-&s;et, and thus affords a light &s;ufficient for mo&s;t of the nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions of life. At Tornao (at mid|&s;ummer) which is in north latitude 66&deg;, the &s;un does not &s;et, but may be &s;een at midnight, with half its di&s;k above the horizon. In winter, the want of the &s;un's heat is &s;upplied by &s;toves within doors, and fires
<PB N="313" REF="324">
without; and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary is good cloathing again&s;t the &s;everity of the cold, that the common people are better habited, than tho&s;e of other parts of Europe. As the winters are &s;evere, the &s;ummers are very hot. Violent &s;torms and rains are &s;eldom &s;een, and the &s;harp, keen north-wind, &s;erves only to purify and re|fre&s;h the air.</P>
<P>The Swedi&s;h coa&s;ts are &s;urrounded with innumer|able capes, i&s;lands and rocks, &s;o that an approach to land is dangerous. The&s;e i&s;lands or rocks lie very near each other, &s;everal thou&s;and of them are inhabited, and the people live chiefly by fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>The lakes in Sweden, which are numerous, contain al&s;o &s;ome thou&s;ands of i&s;lands. There are twenty-three lakes in Ea&s;t Gothland, twenty-one in Smoland, and &s;everal in the other provinces. The lake Wetter is near 100 Engli&s;h miles in length, and re&s;embles rather a &s;ea, than a piece of inland water. The Wener is eighty-four Engli&s;h miles long, and forty-two broad; twenty-four rivers empty them&s;elves into it, and only one flows from it. Many of the&s;e lakes are naviga|ble, and might be made much more &s;o at a very little expence. The Maeler lake in Lapland, is &s;eventy-two Engli&s;h miles long, full of fi&s;h, and is &s;aid to contain 1290 i&s;lands. Its banks are &s;o beautifully di|ver&s;ified with trees, ca&s;tles, churches, noblemen's &s;eats, and other edifices, as to afford many beautiful pro&s;|pects.
<PB N="314" REF="325">
The views, &s;ays <HI>Con&s;et,</HI> are not inferior to tho&s;e of Richmond or Wind&s;or, large fields of luxurious corn, and hills richly cloathed with lofty trees, e&s;pecially oaks of an amazing &s;ize. The beautiful and large lake, Wetter, along the &s;ide of which the high road runs for &s;everal miles, is &s;kirted by many plea&s;ant villages, and in its center is an i&s;land, fourteen or fifteen miles long, form|ing one complete pari&s;h, and a mo&s;t delightful place of re&s;idence it is. Were it not for the inten&s;e cold and drifted &s;now, a pa&s;&s;age over the rivers and lakes, in winter, would be as much more commodious for the traveller, as it is for the bu&s;ine&s;s and intercour&s;e of the inhabitants; who are &s;afely conveyed over the ice in &s;ledges, at the rate of fifteen Engli&s;h miles an hour.</P>
<P>Woods and va&s;t fore&s;ts over&s;pread much of the country, and con&s;i&s;t chiefly of pines, fir, beach, alder, juniper, and &s;ome oak; e&s;pecially in the province of Bleaking, where the trees grow &s;o thick, and lie to rot where they fall, that the ways are impa&s;&s;able. They afford, however, plentiful and cheap firing, and being generally very &s;treight and tall, are ea&s;ily convertible into timber fit for all u&s;es. Charcoal, is not half &s;o good as ours, but is &s;ix times as cheap as in England.</P>
<P>In Finland, they burn whole tracts of underwood; by felling it in the &s;pring, letting it lie all the &s;um|mer, till it is dry, then burning it, and &s;trewing the
<PB N="315" REF="326">
land with wheat, &amp;c. before the a&s;hes are cold. They often plough the &s;eed and a&s;hes in together, and if the &s;ea&s;on is a good one, the crop will be from 100 to 150 fold. In many parts of Gothland, the firs, on the high road to Stockholm, form avenues as noble as tho&s;e which are planted in the entrance to palaces or noblemen's &s;eats; but, in other parts, a &s;canty &s;oil &s;ays <HI>Wraxhall,</HI> where the utmo&s;t indu&s;try can only produce a &s;ickly harve&s;t, covers the bo&s;om of a va&s;t expan&s;e of rock, which, in many places, appears bare and hideous, or only gives birth to a number of firs, which run up to a va&s;t height on its naked &s;ur|face, and &s;eem kindly lent by nature, to hide, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, her penurious and inho&s;pitable a&s;pect. In Delecarlia, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> the country is &s;o romantic, that the view, as far as the eye can command, from the tops of the mountains, is one va&s;t range of moun|tain beyond mountain, till you &s;ee the ridge that parts Sweden from Norway, ri&s;ing far above the common clouds. The whole pro&s;pect is a thick woodland, in|ter&s;ected with lakes, and forming wonderful &s;cenes, &s;trikingly awful and &s;ublime. The &s;ituation of the village of Lyma, continues the &s;ame author, is greatly uncommon; it lies within the bend of a river, which is, in fact, a continued water-fall, running over one ridge of rocks, the moment it has pa&s;&s;ed another, and mak|ing &s;uch an ince&s;&s;ant noi&s;e, as almo&s;t to &s;tun the whole village; immediately behind it, ri&s;es a ridge of mountains, who&s;e tops in lowering weather, reach
<PB N="316" REF="327">
above the clouds; &s;o that the appearance of the&s;e dread|ful heights, with the torrents tumbling at their feet, is magnificent in the extreme. I have viewed moun|tains, &s;ays he, rocks, water-falls, and lakes, in the north of England and in Scotland, but they are pigmies com|pared with the&s;e. There is an impre&s;&s;ion in the&s;e &s;cenes, that &s;trikes the &s;pectator with a far &s;uperior degree of awe.</P>
<P>The provinces of Upland, We&s;tmanland, and Nerike, which I traver&s;ed &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> in my way to Gottenburg, are e&s;teemed the riche&s;t and fine&s;t parts of Sweden; and indeed I can hardly figure to my&s;elf a more va|riegated and plea&s;ing &s;cene, than is exhibited by the general face of the country; hills, dales, rocks and vallies, &s;mall plains, numerous lakes, fertile meadows and arable land, frequent country villages and &s;cattered farm-hou&s;es are blended together with a con&s;tant and delightful variety. Thus Sweden, which &s;ome travellers, forming their judgment merely from the few di&s;tricts that fall under their immediate ob&s;ervations, have di&s;|cribed as a barren and ungenial &s;oil, is evidently not deficient in the mo&s;t picture&s;que beauties of rural na|ture.</P>
<P>It abounds in every &s;pecies of the three natural king|doms, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the fo&s;&s;ile, or mineral kind, as chry&s;tals, amethy&s;ts, topazes, porphyry, lapis-lazuli agates, cornelian, a reddi&s;h &s;tone, called <HI>viol&s;tein,</HI> a
<PB N="317" REF="328">
greeni&s;h &s;emi-pellucid &s;tone, a&s;be&s;tos, coral, load-&s;tone, touch-&s;tone, lime-&s;tone, &s;late, free-&s;tone, beautiful petrifac|tions, &amp;c. Near Nordkioping are large quantities of ex|cellent, white marble, with beautiful, green veins. Mu&s;covy i&s;ing-gla&s;s, a rhomboidical &s;par, white earth, quick&s;il|ver, lead-ore, ceru&s;e, cobalt, allum, &s;ulphur, mother-of-pearl and fullers-earth, are al&s;o here found: and in Finland they have pearl-fi&s;heries of great value.</P>
<P>But the great wealth of Sweden, ari&s;es from its mines, and metals. Gold-ore has been di&s;covered in Smoland, and pure &s;ilver is dug up in Warmeland; but the large&s;t &s;ilver mine is near Sala.</P>
<P>The gold-mine from 1741 to 1747 produced an|nually 2398 gold ducats, at 9s, 4d. &s;terling each, and the produce of the &s;ilver mine at Sala, from 1743 to 1747 was 8700 Lothige marks, per year, each equal to nine ounces twelve pennyweights troy.</P>
<P>At the above &s;ilver-mine, workmen are let down in ba&s;kets, to the fir&s;t landing-place, which is 105 fa|thoms below the &s;urface of the ground. The roof there is as high as a church, &s;upported by va&s;t arches of ore. Thence the de&s;cent is by ladders or ba&s;kets to the lowe&s;t mine, above 40 fathoms. They have no records &s;o ancient, as the fir&s;t di&s;covery, either of this or the copper-mine mentioned below, which mu&s;t needs have been the work of many ages. The ore
<PB N="318" REF="329">
&s;eldom yields above four per cent, and requires great pains to refine it. The water, as well as the ore, is drawn by mills, and of its produce the king has the pre-emption, paying one fourth le&s;s than the real value.</P>
<P>The great copper-mine at Falun, is 80 fathoms deep, and of great extent, and yields annually, the value of 200,000<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling, of which the King has a fourth part in kind and a duty of 25 per cent, on the remain|der, if exported unwrought.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o a great number of iron-mines, and forges, e&s;pecially in the mountainous parts of the country, where they have the convenience of water-mills to work them, and from the&s;e, be&s;ides what they keep for their own u&s;e, they export yearly to the value of 300,000<HI>l.</HI> The ore, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Wraxhall,</HI> who vi&s;ited one of the&s;e mines at Danmora, in 1774, is not dug, as in our mines of tin and coal, but is torn up by gunpowder. <Q>This operation is performed every day at noon, and is, beyond conception, tremendous and awful, re&s;em|bling &s;ubterraneous thunder, or rather vollies of ar|tillery di&s;charged under ground. The &s;tones are thrown up, by the violence of the powder, to a va&s;t height above the &s;urface of the earth, and the con|cu&s;&s;ion is &s;o great, as to &s;hake the &s;urrounding earth or rock, on every &s;ide. I felt a plea&s;ure cor|rected with terror, as I hung over this va&s;t and
<PB N="319" REF="330">
giddy hollow, which is half an Engli&s;h mile in cir|cumference, and to the bottom of which, the eye attempts in vain to penetrate. I ventured however, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Wraxhall,</HI> to de&s;cend into this mine, and was let down with two men, in a large, deep bas|ket, fa&s;tened by chains to a rope; and I am not a&s;hamed to own, that when I had got a good way down, and found my&s;elf &s;u&s;pended between heaven and earth, by a rope, and looked down into the deep and dark aby&s;s, below me, to which I could &s;ee no termination, I &s;huddered with appre|hen&s;ion, and half repented my curio&s;ity; but this was only a momentary &s;en&s;ation, and before I had de&s;cended a hundred feet, I looked round on the &s;cene, with very tolerable compo&s;ure. I was near nine minutes before I reached the bottom, it being eighty fathoms, or 480 feet. The view of the mine when I reached it, was awful and &s;ublime in the highe&s;t degree. The light of the day was faintly admitted into the&s;e &s;ubterraneous caverns. In many places it was lo&s;t, and flambeaus &s;upplied its place. I &s;aw the frame of wood, acro&s;s &s;ome parts, from one &s;ide of the rock to the other, whereon the miners &s;at boring holes for the admi&s;&s;ion of the powder, with as much unconcern, as I could have felt in any ordinary employment, though the lea&s;t dizzine&s;s, or even a failure in pre&s;erving their equilibrium, mu&s;t have made them lo&s;e their &s;eat, and da&s;hed them to pieces again&s;t the rugged &s;ur|face
<PB N="320" REF="331">
of the rock beneath. The weather above was very warm, but here ice covered the whole &s;urface of the ground, and I found my&s;elf &s;urrounded with the colds of the mo&s;t rigorous winter, amid dark|ne&s;s and caves of iron. In one of the&s;e which was a con&s;iderable way under the rock, were eight wretches warming them&s;elves round a charcoal fire, and eat|ing their little, &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, produced from their mi&s;erable occupations; I &s;ay mi&s;erable, for it is little el&s;e than confinement for life in a horrid dungeon. There are no le&s;s than 1300 men here con&s;tantly employed, and their pay only threepence Engli&s;h a day. The&s;e mines were fir&s;t opened in 1580, and with little intermi&s;&s;ion have been work|till this time.</Q></P>
<P>The country in the village of Up&s;al is chiefly a horrid de&s;art, covered with &s;hapele&s;s &s;tones, or with impenetrable woods, incapable of cultivation, and de|void of inhabitants. The quantity of land in tillage does not bear the proportion of one to twenty. Na|ture has, however, made them, in &s;ome degree, amends for this par&s;imony, by enriching their barren wa&s;tes with inexhau&s;table mines, and the forges attendant on the&s;e mines are numerous, each forge employing from four to fourteen hundred workmen in iron. Where|ever there is a country-&s;eat, there is one of the&s;e iron-works, and no people were ever more expert in working their materials, than are the pea&s;ants of this
<PB N="321" REF="332">
country. They will exert them&s;elves almo&s;t beyond the power of man, and &s;trike the iron with &s;uch pro|digious force, and &s;uch quick repeated blows, as to be envelloped in red-hot &s;parks. I had the plea&s;ure, continues Mr. <HI>Wraxhall,</HI> of viewing the whole proce&s;s, u&s;ed to reduce the ore into iron, and mu&s;t own it was curious and in&s;tructive. They fir&s;t roa&s;t it, in the air, for a con&s;iderable time, after which it is thrown into a furnace, and when reduced to fu&s;ion, is poured into a mould of &s;and, about three yards long. The&s;e pigs of iron are next heated in a forge, and when red|hot, a piece is pinched off, and beat to a le&s;s &s;ize, with hammers. This &s;maller piece is then formed into a bar, by a great hammer, of a ton-weight, rai&s;ed by a water-mill. Five of the&s;e mills, &s;ays <HI>Motraye,</HI> who travelled through Sweden in 1716 and 1718, annually work 4000 &s;hipunds of iron; each &s;hipund three Cwt. Engli&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> who travelled through Sweden in 1769, and who enquired into the hu&s;bandry, &s;ays a tolerable good farm, of about 100 Engli&s;h acres, will let for about 22<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling; that, though, till lately, Sweden rai&s;ed no wheat, they now &s;ow &s;ufficient for their own con&s;umption, and the farmers find it as profitable to them, as it is in other countries, though their crops are not &s;o plentiful. In &s;heltered &s;ituations they have, as in warmer climates, on the be&s;t lands, very fine crops, and an acre will produce from
<PB N="322" REF="333">
one and a half to three quarters, but they never &s;ow wheat, except in their be&s;t fields. Oats is their mo&s;t general crop, though they have a large produce of peas and beans. But the article they are mo&s;t deficient in, is gra&s;s; as few of the farmers know any thing of the artificial gra&s;s, except clover, and not a twen|tieth part of the kingdom rai&s;e corn. The low grounds of Sweden are generally converted into pa&s;|turage, a kind of coar&s;e meadow, and many of them are little better than bogs and mar&s;hes. They are however taking great pains in the &s;tate, to improve their agriculture, prohibiting the importation of corn; affix|ing premiums for good conduct and improvements, for draining of bogs, cultivating wa&s;tes, and breeding of cattle.</P>
<P>In the woody parts of Sweden, though the ground is rich and fertile, thickly covered with fine timber, and provi&s;ions can be procured in the greate&s;t plenty, yet the &s;ee-&s;imple of &s;uch an acre of land may be purcha&s;ed for four &s;hillings. Nothing wants a regulation more than the woods of this kingdom, the wa&s;te that is made in cutting them, both in timber and land, being exceedingly great.</P>
<P>There being &s;o &s;hort a &s;ummer and no &s;pring in this country, the productions of the earth are more &s;peedy in their growth, than in other places. In the beginning of &s;ummer, the fields are &s;tored with va|riety
<PB N="323" REF="334">
of flowers; and &s;trawberries, ra&s;berries and &s;uch kind of fruits, grow on every rock. Melons are brought to perfection in their gardens, in dry years, but peaches, apricots, and other wall-fruits are ex|ceedingly &s;carce; as are al&s;o apples, pears and plumbs; and tho&s;e they have, are not well-ta&s;ted; cherries they have of &s;everal &s;orts, and &s;ome tolerably good, and plenty of all kinds of roots. The gardens about Stockholm, &s;ays <HI>Motraye,</HI> are very fine, and notwith|&s;tanding the &s;everity of the winter, their green-hou&s;es afford orange, fig, myrtle, and other trees, and plants and flowers of the mo&s;t tender nature.</P>
<P>The wild bea&s;ts of this country, are bears, wolves, elks, deer, foxes, hares, wea&s;els and &s;quirrels, of which the la&s;t three, in the northern provinces, change their colour, in winter-time, to white. There are but few parks, and tho&s;e indifferently &s;tocked, owing to the expence of &s;upporting deer through their long winters. Swedi&s;h hunting &s;carce de&s;erves the name, for they &s;urround the game, and &s;hoot and murder it, as they can. There is very little riding in the ca&s;e, either here or in Germany; they have no rabbits, but &s;uch as are brought into the country, as a curio&s;ity, and are kept tame.</P>
<P>Fowl, both wild and tame, are, plentiful and good, within land; except &s;ea-fowl, which feed on, and ta&s;te of, fi&s;h. The orre and chader, are peculiar birds, &s;o are the
<PB N="324" REF="335">
hierpe, and &s;noripa. The orre re&s;embles our black game in England, but larger, with a webbed foot. The chader or kader, is a remarkable fine bird, as large as a common turkey, the cock is black, the hen of an orange-colour, and not quite &s;o large as the cock; the hen generally lays about eight or ten eggs; but the hierpe is reckoned the fine&s;t game that can be eaten. In &s;ize, it is like a young pidgeon; in colour, black, grey and white. The &s;noripa is rather larger for the fir&s;t two years, turns white in winter, and grey in &s;ummer, like the hares, afterwards it remains always white. It is a bird, peculiar to Swedi&s;h Lap|land, &s;ays <HI>Con&s;et,</HI> or the neighbouring countries. A &s;ingle one once made its appearance within a hundred mile, of Stockholm, and from the particular noi&s;e it made at night, alarmed the country-people, who took it for the voice of a gho&s;t, and &s;o much were they terrified by this invi&s;ible &s;pirit, that nothing could tempt the po&s;t-boys after it was dark, to pa&s;s the wood it frequented. It was, however, found out, at la&s;t, by &s;ome gentlemen, who ordered their game|keepers to watch by moon-light, to be the harmle&s;s &s;noripa. The&s;e birds I have mentioned are reckoned great rarieties at Stockholm, where they are &s;ent in winter, and &s;old at great prices.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o phea&s;ants and partridges, but not &s;o good-flavoured as ours, and in the woods of Finland and Lapland, abundance of woodcocks; but the better
<PB N="325" REF="336">
cla&s;s of people being exceedingly fond of woodcock's eggs, encourage the boors to rob their ne&s;ts, and this not only makes them &s;carce in many parts of Sweden, but even England, and &s;ome other countries feel the ill effects of it; pidgeons al&s;o are very &s;carce. The northern and de&s;art parts abound with eagles, hawks and other birds of prey, where nature &s;eems to call them, as may be pre&s;umed from a large hawk, be|longing to the French King, being &s;hot &s;ome years &s;ince, in the north of Finland, which had a gold ring round one leg, with this in&s;cription, <HI>Je &s;uis an Roy,</HI> "I belong to the king": and on the other, a &s;imilar one, with the&s;e words <HI>Duc de Chevereu&s;e me garde.</HI> "the duke de Cheveureu&s;e keeps me".</P>
<P>Their lakes and rivers are &s;tored with a variety of good fi&s;h, as &s;almon, perch, trout, tench, pike, and al&s;o a fi&s;h called a <HI>&s;treamling,</HI> rather le&s;s than a pil|chard, which are &s;alted, barrelled up, and &s;ent to all parts of the country. In the gulph of Bothnia they catch a quantity of &s;eals, of which they make train-oil.</P>
<P>The cattle, as in all other northern countries, are generally of a &s;mall &s;ize, nor can the breed be im|proved, as they naturally degenerate in cold climates. Their &s;heep yield but a very cour&s;e wool, fit only to make cloaths for the pea&s;ants. The hor&s;es e&s;pe|cially the Finni&s;h, though &s;mall as our ponies, are
<PB N="326" REF="337">
hardy, vigorous, &s;trong, &s;ure-footed, and good trotters, and the &s;oldiery pretend that, in war, they are not only able to re&s;i&s;t, but will break a body of the be&s;t German hor&s;e. The riches of many of the farmers con&s;i&s;t in large droves of black cattel, many &s;heep, and numerous herds of hogs. They pay their rent in corn and cattle, and their pea&s;ants in cattle, hogs, and the keep of cows, which give a good deal of milk, and are reckoned the mo&s;t profitable cattle they keep.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the People and Cities.</HEAD>
<P>SWEDEN, in proportion to its extent, is not &s;ufficiently peopled, of this &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching</HI> there is a remarkable in&s;tance in one place, not the mo&s;t nor|thern part of the kingdom, where are &s;carce 4700 per&s;ons in the compa&s;s of 225 geographical &s;quare miles. This want of population, Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> attri|butes to the &s;mall number of farmers; they being only pea&s;ants, with land enough round they cottages for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of the people within them. Many of the&s;e little &s;pots belong to them, and none of their children will ever brook living in a wor&s;e manner than
<PB N="327" REF="338">
their fathers did; &s;o that a family, in this &s;ituation, is &s;ure to have but one repre&s;entative. This prevents marriages among the &s;ons, for as they cannot have their own cottages and lands, they live at home unmarried with the brother who inherits, and thus little or no increa&s;e happens but by accident. But if all the&s;e pea&s;ants lived in hired cottages, without land, as with us, and the country was cultivated by great farmers, the&s;e farmers would extend their farms, employ the&s;e pea|&s;ants, till more land, and what they could not expend, they would export; they would fix their &s;ons in other farms and the country would be more populous.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, the country behind Wa&s;&s;ay, quite to the White-&s;ea, through &s;everal Ru&s;&s;ian provinces, at the di&s;tance of 700 miles, is nearly one continued fore&s;t, and &s;o thinly peopled, that &s;carce one inhabitant is to be met with the whole way. I traver&s;ed the province of Smoland, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> from Gotheborg to Carl&s;crone, which is &s;aid to be the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t uncultivated region of this kingdom, and in the di&s;tance of 247 Engli&s;h miles, only one place, dignified with the name of a town, pre&s;ented it&s;elf. The villages, for the mo&s;t part, con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix or &s;even hou&s;es; and &s;ometimes where I &s;topped to change hor&s;es, I found nothing but a &s;ingle, &s;olitary cottage; yet all through this &s;eem|ingly inho&s;pitable track, I met with good roads, tolerable accomodations, and a chearful and contented pea&s;antry. In Smoland, &s;ays <HI>Wraxhall,</HI> I have driven
<PB N="328" REF="339">
from one &s;tage to another of 12 to 14 Engli&s;h miles, without meeting or &s;eeing a &s;ingle per&s;on though I impatiently looked for them. Some learned Swedes compute the number of the inhabitants of Sweden and Finland to about three millions, others about two millions. Some pari&s;hes are &s;o exten&s;ive that a pea&s;ant mu&s;t travel many Swedi&s;h miles to vi&s;it his next neighbour, and &s;ome others are &s;o large, as to equal a whole province of Holland, though &s;uch a pari&s;h &s;hall not have as many wretched cottages as there are towns in &s;uch a flouri&s;hing province. Mr <HI>Coxe</HI> &s;ays, that from an accurate &s;urvey, in 1781, the number of people amounted to 2,767,000, being an increa&s;e of more than half a million in 80 years.</P>
<P>The Swedes are robu&s;t, hardy and vigorous, and are inured to all kinds of hard&s;hips and fatigues, which they undergo with chearfulne&s;s; and the pea&s;ants are a heavy, plodding kind of people. Where they are not too much expo&s;ed to the weather, their com|plexions are good, and their hair like all other nor|thern nations, frequently inclined to yellow. The wo|men are of a ju&s;t proportion, have tolerable features, and many are pretty, with golden locks; tho&s;e who do not live by labour are generally fair; tho&s;e who do, are as tawney as the Laplanders. For here the pea&s;ants make the women take a part in all their la|borious employs, they go to plough, thre&s;h the corn, carry the water, &s;erve the bricklayer and carry loads, as the men do with us.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="341">The common people dre&s;s, as do the natives of Denmark. Tho&s;e who are poor make their cloaths of &s;heep-&s;kins, with the wool on; and go bare-footed, but are, in general, better habited than the poor of other countries. The fa&s;hion is much the &s;ame with other European nations, and like them in &s;ummer, wear &s;uch cloaths or &s;tuffs, as they can procure.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual court-dre&s;s, introduced into this country by the pre&s;ent King, is like the ancient Spani&s;h, a &s;a&s;h round the wai&s;t, a &s;word, large and full breeches, ro&s;es at the knees and in the &s;hoes. The cloak of black cloth, edged with red &s;atin, the jacket and breeches all black, ornamented with red &s;tripes and buttons; the wai&s;tcoat, &s;a&s;h, pinks at the knees, and ro&s;es for the &s;hoes, are of red &s;atin. The lady's dre&s;s, is a black-&s;ilk robe, with &s;lit &s;leeves, puffed with a white gauze, coloured &s;a&s;h and ribbands. This is the u&s;ual dre&s;s, but on &s;olemn occa&s;ions, the men wear white cloth or &s;atin, lined or &s;triped with red &s;atin; the women, white &s;ilk or &s;atin, with coloured ribbands, and &s;a&s;h. The men who have not been pre&s;ented at court, are dre&s;&s;ed almo&s;t intirely in black, without any red lining and ornaments; and the women of the &s;ame de&s;cription, mu&s;t not appear with the white gauze &s;leeves. In other re&s;pects, their attire is &s;imilar to that ju&s;t de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="342">The diet of people of condition is much the &s;ame with our own, except that they drink freer. They have a variety of wines without end, and a profu&s;ion of di&s;hes at their entertainments, but &s;hew no ta&s;te in the arrangment or di&s;po&s;ition of them. The ta|ble groans beneath a number of covers, all brought in at once, and then left to cool, during a meal of two hours, and is followed with fruits and &s;weet-meats. Every di&s;h, after being cut up, is handed about in rotation, from one to another; and every one helps him|&s;elf and pa&s;&s;es it to the next. Wine and all other liquors &s;tand upon the table; the rule is to help your|&s;elf, without any kind of ceremony. Healths are not drank. The ladies are particularly a&s;&s;iduous in filling the gentlemen's gla&s;&s;es. After dinner, the cloth is not drawn as in England, nor do the men &s;it after the women withdraw. Each gentleman conducts a lady to another &s;uit of apartments, where coffee is prepared. Tea about three hours after, then cards and mu&s;ic, or a walk till &s;upper.</P>
<P>But, it is cu&s;tomary here to a&s;&s;emble round a &s;ide-board, previous to dinner, and regale with bread, chee&s;e, and butter, and followed by both &s;exes with a bumper gla&s;s of brandy; for in Stockholm, and other cold countries, the cu&s;tom of drinking prevails rather too much; not only among the men, but the women, which, though it doubtle&s;s originated from the &s;everity of the climate, is only worthy of
<PB N="331" REF="343">
the Mu&s;covites, before the reign of their reformer Peter, when it was a regulation at all Ru&s;&s;ian enter|tainments, that ladies were not to get drunk before ten o'clock. At an entertainment at which Sir <HI>Harry Lyddel</HI> was pre&s;ent, one of the di&s;hes &s;erved up was a pike-pudding, con&s;i&s;ting of a pike dre&s;&s;ed &s;o as to re&s;emble the ta&s;te of a cu&s;tard, and yet not lo&s;e the flavour of the fi&s;h.</P>
<P>There being a &s;carcity of wheat in the northern parts of Sweden, the poor eat a &s;ort of bread, made of the bark of birch and pine-trees, &s;traw, and roots. The <HI>Hacke-brod</HI> or <HI>Stampe-brod</HI> is al&s;o very common; it is made of the ears of corn, cut from the &s;tems, minced &s;mall, and afterwards dried and ground. The bark-bread is made of the outer-bark of fir, fir&s;t par|ing off the coar&s;e knots, then drying it, till it becomes brown, either in an oven or before the fire, when it undergoes a fermentation, &s;o as to con&s;ume the re&s;in. This bark is then ground into meal, and thus made into bread. Twice in the year, they bake their bread in large, round cakes, which are &s;trung upon files of &s;ticks, and &s;u&s;pended clo&s;e to the cielings of their cottages. They are &s;o hard, as to be occa&s;ionally broken with a hatchet, but are not unplea&s;ant. The common drink of the pea&s;ants is beer, but they have frequent recour&s;e to malt-&s;pirits. The low-priced brandies here, &s;ays <HI>Con&s;et,</HI> are di&s;tilled from rye and ants, a &s;pecies of in&s;ect very plentiful in this country.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="344">The ant u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion is a large, black in|&s;ect, commonly found in &s;mall round hills, at the bottom of the fir-tree. They not only di&s;til them but eat them, and con&s;ider them as highly palatable and plea&s;ant. As I was walking, continues this author, with a young gentleman, in a wood near Gottenburg, I ob&s;erved him &s;it down on one of the&s;e living hills, which from the nature of its inhabitants, I &s;hould rather have avoided, and begin, with &s;ome degree of alacrity, to devour the&s;e in&s;ects, fir&s;t nipping off their heads and wings. The flavour he declared was of the fine&s;t acid, and rather re&s;embling that of a lemon. My young friend invited me to ta&s;te them, but my antipathy, to &s;uch kind of food, overcame me. In phy&s;ic we are told, the&s;e ants &s;upply a re&s;in, an oil and an acid. Smoking is general among the &s;econd and lowe&s;t cla&s;s of people after dinner.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of the pea&s;ants are built of wood and covered with &s;hingles, and though only of one &s;tory, are much better than our mud or thatched cottages, and are comfortable and commodious. The room in which the family &s;leeps, is provided with ranges of beds in tiers, as in cabins of &s;hips, one above the other. Upon the wooden te&s;ters of the beds in which the women lie, are placed others for the men, into which they get by ladders. Their fur|niture is of their own manufacturing, con&s;i&s;ting of little more, than what they make of their friendly

pines. All of them handle the &s;pade and axe, with as much agility, as our pea&s;ants do the &s;pade and pick-axe, nor do they turn out bad or clum&s;y work; for their chairs, tables, beds, &amp;c. are very decently cut and put together.</P>
<P>As we &s;hall have an opportunity of &s;pearing more particularly of their hou&s;es, dre&s;s, &amp;c. in de&s;cribing the chief towns, we will &s;ay no more on this head at pre&s;ent, but proceed to give &s;ome account of their principal cities, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Stockholm, being the capital of the whole kngdom and the city where the court is held, demands our fir&s;t attention. It is &s;ituated in 59 degrees 20 min. north latitude, at the junction of the Baltic and the Maeler lake, and has thus the convenience of both &s;alt and fre&s;h water. It's circuit, computed from one gate to the other, is two Swedi&s;h miles, and it &s;tands partly on i&s;lands, and partly on penin&s;ulas, and &s;ome|what re&s;embles the city of Venice. Mo&s;t of the &s;treets are broad, &s;trait, and regular, and kept very clean, and the market-places are &s;pacious. The pub|lic buildings are many, and are great ornaments to the place. It is con&s;iderably larger than Copenhagen, but its &s;uperiority of &s;ize, re&s;ults more from &s;ingula|rity of &s;ituation, than any real advantage over Copen|hagen in extent. It is built on &s;even &s;mall i&s;lands, or rocks, formed by the river, and the &s;uburbs ex|tend
<PB N="334" REF="347">
on the main land, a con&s;iderable way, north and &s;outh. A variety of contra&s;ted and enchanting views are formed by numberle&s;s rocks of granite, ri&s;ing bold|ly from the &s;urface of the water, partly bare and craggy, partly dotted with hou&s;es, or feathered with wood. The inequality of the ground renders almo&s;t all the &s;treets &s;teep and inconvenient for carriages, and they are badly paved, but the hou&s;es are lofty and hand&s;ome, though chiefly compo&s;ed of brick. It is half as large again, as it was in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> XII. and, in the new quarter, there are many noble &s;treets of a va&s;t length.</P>
<P>The harbour is an inlet of the Baltic, the water as pelucid as chry&s;tal, and of &s;uch a depth that &s;hips, of the large&s;t burden, can approach the quay, which is very broad, near an Engli&s;h mile long, and lined with &s;pacious buildings and warehou&s;es. The harbour is large enough to contain a thou&s;and &s;ail of &s;hips, but, with all its convenience, the utility of its &s;ituation is dimini&s;hed, from its difficulty of communication with the &s;ea, here being no tides, and the whole being frozen up four months in the year. At the extre|mity of the harbour &s;everal &s;treets ri&s;e, one above another, in form of an amphitheatre, and the palace, a magnificent building, crowns the &s;ummit. Towards the &s;ea, about two or three miles from the city, the harbour is contracted into a narrow &s;treight, and, wind|ing among high rocks, is lo&s;t to the &s;ight. This, with
<PB N="335" REF="348">
the pro&s;pect, terminated with di&s;tant hills, over&s;pread with trees, exhibits &s;uch &s;ingular views, as is beyond the power of words to deliniate.</P>
<P>This city carries the chief trade of the kingdom, of cour&s;e, there is a face of bu&s;ine&s;s and activity on the public quay, which, in a town, is far more lively than the perpetual rattle of coaches.</P>
<P>The palace, which &s;tands in the center of the city and on the highe&s;t &s;pot of ground, on a hill, very &s;teep on every &s;ide, commands a complete pro&s;pect of the metropolis, the river, and &s;urrounding country. It is a large, quadrangular, &s;tone edifice, elegant and &s;tate|ly in its &s;tile of architecture, was begun to be built by <HI>Charles</HI> XI. continued under Frederic and the late Kings, but is not yet quite completed. It has within, a citadel, but badly fortified. During the win|ter, the whole royal family re&s;ide in it; many of the apartments are &s;plendidly furni&s;hed, but the&s;e are three or four pair of &s;tairs high, the palace &s;erving for many public u&s;es, and all the rooms of the fir&s;t and &s;econd floor, which are &s;mall, being appropriated to the private meetings of the &s;enate, and the courts of judicature.</P>
<P>The &s;enate-hou&s;e, where the public meetings of the privy-council are held, is a regular, fine edifice, and makes the be&s;t appearance of any in the town. Ex|cepting
<PB N="336" REF="349">
in the &s;uburbs, where the hou&s;es are of wood, painted red, the generality of the buildings are of &s;tone, or brick, &s;tuccoed white; there is al&s;o a public bank, covered with copper, as are the hou&s;es of the nobility, and thus appear rich and beautiful to the eye. The &s;uburbs, being mo&s;tly built of wood, are liable to accidents from fire, but, to remove the dan|ger, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the city is divided into 12 wards, and in each of the&s;e, is a ma&s;ter and four a&s;&s;i&s;tants, who&s;e duty is to repair to the fire imme|diately, with a number of porters and labourers. They have al&s;o a fire-watch, in each church-&s;teeple, and a bell is rung on the fir&s;t appearance of any &s;uch calamity.</P>
<P>The ar&s;inal is a large building, but by no means kept well-&s;tored, except it is with &s;tandards and tro|phies, chiefly taken from the Imperiali&s;ts, Poles, Ru&s;|&s;ians, and Danes; and of the&s;e there are a great num|ber. Among other curio&s;ities here, is the &s;kin of the hor&s;e, &s;tuffed, which carried <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus</HI> at the battle of Lutzen, a boat made by <HI>Peter the Great</HI> at Sardam, and taken by a Swedi&s;h ve&s;&s;el as it was conveying by &s;ea to Peter&s;burgh, and the cloaths and hat worn by <HI>Charles</HI> XII. when he was &s;hot in the trenches before Frederick&s;hall. This coat is a plain, blue uniform, like that of a common &s;oldier, with gilt buttons, yellow wai&s;tcoat and breeches, and black cravat, &s;uch as he has always been painted in; the
<PB N="337" REF="350">
&s;tockings are &s;ewed to the breeches; his boots are thick and large, his gloves of white leather with &s;tiff tops, and reaching almo&s;t to the elbows; the right-hand glove con&s;iderably &s;tained with blood, the left only &s;prinkled with a few drops, and part of a brace|let he wore that day, a little bloody al&s;o.</P>
<P>The royal &s;tables, and the great ho&s;pital al&s;o make &s;ome figure, but the market mu&s;t not be omitted. Butchers meat is &s;old in &s;hambles on the &s;hore, whil&s;t vegetables, and other marketable commodities, are expo&s;ed to &s;ale in boats upon the water. This is at once a &s;ingular and a plea&s;ing &s;ight. The moving &s;hops, and variety of wares, that are pa&s;&s;ing before the eye; the mixed and bu&s;y multitude which croud the &s;urface of the water, renders this a very agreeable &s;cene. Something of this kind may be &s;een on the Thames, on the arrival of a large fleet in the pool.</P>
<P>In this city there are upwards of 5000 hou&s;es, chiefly of &s;tone, four or five &s;tories high, built on piles. It is computed to be as populous as Bri&s;tol. There are 20 churches covered with copper, and &s;uperbly decorated with a great variety of &s;plendid or|naments, having lofty &s;pires, with mu&s;ical bells in their &s;teeples, but no large bells. In the church of St. Nicholas, which is the large&s;t, and &s;upported by marble pillars, are, a great number of tombs of dif|ferent
<PB N="338" REF="351">
kinds of marble. This church has a picture on the right-&s;ide of the altar, upon the wall, well painted, de&s;cribing paradi&s;e and hell, reaching from the floor to the roof, and is very rich in plate. Here is a chalice of beaten gold, enriched with jewels, which according to <HI>Motraye,</HI> is not worth le&s;s than 40,000 crowns.</P>
<P>In the church of Ritterholm, are the &s;epulchres of the Kings of Sweden. The tomb of <HI>Charles</HI> XII. is a rai&s;ed tomb of black marble, with no other in|&s;cription than his name; over it are laid in ca&s;t bronze, a club and a lions &s;kin.</P>
<P>The government of this city, is in the hands of a great &s;tadtholder, who is al&s;o a privy-coun&s;ellor, under him are two burgo-ma&s;ters, who have different apart|ments in the palace, and with the&s;e &s;it about twenty city-coun&s;ellors, men in trade. The city maintains a guard of 300 men, and to &s;upport this and the public buildings, they are empowered to levy a tax of from one pound to 60&pound;. annually, on the traders, according to their wealth.</P>
<P>The King has &s;everal palaces, one at the ea&s;t end of Ladu-gards-land, built in 1732: near it is a park and a fine orangery; the park is almo&s;t &s;urrounded with water. It has a medicinal &s;pring within, and nothing can be more delightful than the beautiful di&s;|po&s;ition
<PB N="339" REF="352">
of the fine groves, lawns and walks with which it is diver&s;ified. There is another palace at Carl&s;berg, with a garden laid out in elegant ta&s;te and decorated with beautiful &s;tatues, &amp;c. Al&s;o another at Ulrich&s;|dal with a fine park, and curious grotto, a few miles from Stockholm; but the fine&s;t of all his palaces is at Drotningholm, about a Swedi&s;h mile we&s;t of Stock|holm. Facing the &s;outh front, is a large garden with a variety of fountains, and, on the north, command|ing a view of the &s;hipping at &s;ea. The gardens, how|ever, give us no idea of royalty; they are laid out in the Dutch ta&s;te, and con&s;idering this place is the &s;ummer re&s;idence of the King, it is wonderful they are not kept in neater order. The palace is a &s;tately fabric, built with brick, on the banks of the Maeler lake, and all the apartments demon&s;trate the fine ta&s;te of the owner, who is the mother of the pre&s;ent King. Here is a great collection of antiquities from the ruins of Herculaneum, with a variety of gems and medals, natural and Roman curio&s;ities; here is is al&s;o a well collected library in every branch of &s;cience, and two galleries of paintings, one de&s;criptive of the victories of <HI>Charles</HI> X. the other, tho&s;e of his &s;on <HI>Charles</HI> XI. In the gardens the queen-dowager has lately built a little &s;emi-circular plea&s;ure-palace, fitted up in the Chine&s;e ta&s;te, where whim and caprice, form the pre|dominant character, and &s;pread a grote&s;que air through|out the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="353">The &s;ituation of Stockholm, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Wraxhall,</HI> is injudicious and improper, for the capital of the kingdom. The inhabitants a&s;&s;ured him that the place owed its origin, about 500 years ago, to an accidental contingency. The viceroy who governed the country at that time, under <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> II. of Denmark, deter|mined to found a city, and in&s;tead of fixing on a proper &s;pot for the execution of his plan, he very wi&s;ely &s;et a large piece of wood afloat, in the Maeler lake; re&s;olving, that at whatever place it &s;topped, there &s;hould be his city. A &s;mall i&s;land &s;topt the log in its way, and the name of Stockholm was given to it in con&s;equence.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething, continues the &s;ame author, un|commonly &s;avage and inho&s;pitable in the whole cir|cumjacent country. Even at the latter end of the month of May, when all nature, animate and inani|mate, awakes from the long &s;lumber of a polar win|ter, every thing here is joyle&s;s and infertile; and the rays of the &s;un are reflected, from an expan&s;e of &s;tone, which inve&s;ts the city round on every &s;ide, and from who&s;e bo&s;om no verdure &s;prings to chear the eye.</P>
<P>The only amu&s;ement, of any moment, in Stockholm, &s;eems to be an opera, performed every Thur&s;day, in Swedi&s;h. The building is hand&s;ome and large, mag|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ently illuminated, and the dre&s;&s;es of the actors
<PB N="341" REF="354">
are &s;uperb. In winter the, weather is too cold to &s;eek amu&s;ement abroad, and as &s;oon as the ice and &s;now leaves the &s;urface of the land, every one that can afford a country-hou&s;e, takes his amu&s;ement there. They have a theatre however, in which French comedies are repre&s;ented &s;ometimes concerts and ora|torios, but the mu&s;ical performers are Germans, and not much encouraged.</P>
<P>This country was formerly involved in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t darkne&s;s of pagan idolatory, and Up&s;al was the &s;eat of their &s;uper&s;titious wor&s;hip. It was al&s;o, in ancient times, the chief &s;eat of the Sovereigns of Sweden, and where they held their &s;upreme tribunal. The greate&s;t &s;acrifices offered in all the northern provinces, were brought to this place in the time of pagani&s;m, and the mo&s;t eminent heathen-prie&s;ts had here their re|&s;idence. It was the mo&s;t ancient town in the Swe|di&s;h highlands, and the chief ornament of the whole country. It is now a univer&s;ity and archiepi&s;copal &s;ee, and a neat city, though not large, containing about 3000 inhabitants, and about 1500 &s;tudents. The ground plot is extremely regular, divided into two equal parts, by a &s;mall rivulet, and the &s;treets are drawn at right angles, from a central kind of &s;quare. A few of the hou&s;es are built with brick and &s;tuccoed, but the generality are con&s;tructed with trunks, &s;moothed into the &s;hape of planks, painted red, and the roofs co|vered in with turf. There is not a &s;tone-edifice in
<PB N="342" REF="355">
it. Fach hou&s;e has its &s;mall court-yard or garden. Old Up&s;ala the re&s;idence of the high-prie&s;t of Oden, &s;tood at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the pre&s;ent city, which ro&s;e upon the ruins of the ancient one, as it fell into de|cay. The old palace by <HI>Gu&s;tavus-Va&s;a</HI> was con&s;umed by fire, in 1702. The remains, which &s;tand on an elevated &s;pot, and command a fine pro&s;pect of the adjacent country, con&s;i&s;t of one wing, a &s;mall part of another, and the principal front which has been repaired, and covered with a red &s;tucco. The room in which the diet of Sweden u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble, is now converted into a granary, 140 feet long, and 90 broad, and the few, other apartments in the broken wing, are u&s;ed as a common gaol. Underneath are three dungeons formerly appropriated to &s;tate-pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The city &s;tands in an open plain, under cultivation all around, about thirty miles north-we&s;t of Stockholm. We have given a view of the entrance into it. The building on the hill is an old ca&s;tle, fortified after the Gothic manner, con&s;i&s;ting of many beautiful and lofty buildings, chiefly of wood, and commanding the whole city. In the center of the town, &s;tands the cathe|dral, a large brick-building, the whole of Gothic con&s;truction, except two towers of later date, orna|mented with &s;mall marble-pillars, of the Doric or|der, and which disfigure the general &s;ymmetry of the other parts. It is built in imitation of the church of Notre-Dame at Paris. In repairing this church late|ly,

<PB N="343" REF="357">
they have added a Doric architrave to the&s;e Go|thic walls, and placed two great domes of copper on the top. In this cathedral lie entombed the ancient kings of Sweden; and among the re&s;t the &s;epulchre that covers the venerable a&s;hes of <HI>Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a.</HI> It &s;tands in a private chapel, and is an oblong mo|nument of marble, with wooden pyramids, at each angle, one of which is taken away. His figure is re|pre&s;ented in marble, between tho&s;e of his fir&s;t two wives. The cathedral has an excellent organ, beau|tifully ornamented, and a very curious clock; &s;hewing, be&s;ides the hours, the day of the month, and week, the remarkable motion of the heavenly bodies, and all the fixed and moveable fea&s;ts. Near the altar, are the remains of king <HI>Eric,</HI> en&s;hrined in a &s;ilver box, where they have re&s;ted undi&s;turbed, upwards of 300 years. Among other relics, is an old log of wood, rudely carved, into the re&s;emblance of a head, &s;carcely hu|man, and called the image of their god <HI>Tbor,</HI> for|merly wor&s;hipped in the&s;e parts; and, a ragged &s;trip of linen, fa&s;tened to a &s;taff like a pair of colours, called the &s;hift of Margeret, which was carried in battle, as the main &s;tandard, in order to animate the troops, by the recollection of her martial &s;pirit.</P>
<P>This town is particularly celebrated for its univer|&s;ity, the &s;tudents of which, are not men of family and condition, as with us; but, are, for the mo&s;t part, mi&s;erably poor, and lodge five or &s;ix together,
<PB N="344" REF="358">
not in cottages, or appropriate buildings, but in and about the town, in wretched hovels, amid dirt and penury. But I &s;hall have to &s;peak of the univer|&s;ity again.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o at Up&s;al a botanical garden, founded by the celebrated <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> and, about &s;even miles from the town, a piece of antiquity, the remains of &s;everal mutilated &s;tones, one of which is known in Swedi&s;h hi&s;tory, as the &s;tone of Mora, upon which the Sove|reigns of Sweden, were annually elected, enthroned, and received the homage of their &s;ubjects. They &s;tand in an open plain and are covered with a brick-building, to pre&s;erve them. The names of the Swe|di&s;h Kings there enthroned, are in&s;cribed on the &s;tones, and dated from 1276 to 1512. The &s;tone of Mora is placed in the mid&s;t of 12 other &s;tones, &s;tanding in a circle round it. There is a &s;imilar monument near St. Buriens in Cornwall, which Camden con|jectures, to have been &s;ome trophy of the Romans under the later Emperors, or of <HI>Athel&s;tan</HI> the Saxon, after he had &s;ubdued Cornwall; or, according to <HI>Wormius,</HI> this piece of antiquity in Cornwall, is where the an|cient, Anglo-Saxon kings were elected and enthroned.</P>
<P>Gothenburg is, next to Stockholm, the principal and mo&s;t trading town in Sweden. It lies on the bor|ders of We&s;t-Gothland, at the mouth of the river Moludal, which lies clo&s;e to the north-&s;ide of the
<PB N="345" REF="359">
city, and is carried by &s;everal canals, through the town. Since 1746, the greate&s;t part has been rebuilt with &s;tone; the &s;treets are broad and kept very clean. It is a bi&s;hop's-&s;ee, has two printing-hou&s;es, a &s;emi|nary, an Orphan-hou&s;e, and &s;everal docks. Its inha|bitants are computed at 13,000. It has an Ea&s;t-India company; a &s;quadron of men-of war lies in the port, and a con&s;tant garri&s;on, is kept in the city. Gothen|burgh is the fourth in order, among the towns, which have a vote in the diet.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> who was there lately, gives the following de&s;cription of it. Gothenburg is built in a very &s;in|gular &s;ituation. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;ea is a mar&s;hy plain, &s;carcely more than half a mile in breadth, watered by the rivers Gotha and Moludal, and almo&s;t intirely inclo&s;ed with high ridges of rocks, &s;o bare and rugged, that they &s;carcely produce a &s;in|gle blade of gra&s;s, and exhibit as barren an appear|ance, as the &s;ummits of the loftie&s;t Alps. Gothenburg &s;tands partly on the ridges and partly in this plain, and divided by the&s;e different &s;ituations, into the upper and lower town. The latter is entirely level, inter|&s;ected by &s;everal canals, in the manner of the Dutch towns, and its hou&s;es are all con&s;tructed upon piles; the upper part hangs on the declivities, and rows of buildings ri&s;e, one above another, like the &s;eats of an amphitheatre. The whole is regularly fortified and its circumference is near three miles, exclu&s;ive of
<PB N="346" REF="360">
the &s;uburbs. The &s;treets are all uniformly &s;traight; a few of the hou&s;es are of brick, but the generality are of wood, painted red; and it has &s;everal tolerable churches. The harbour is formed by two chains of rocks, and is about a quarter of a mile broad. Its entrance from the north &s;ea is defended by the fort of Elf&s;borg, which &s;tands on a &s;mall rocky i&s;land, and contains a garri&s;on of 250 men.</P>
<P>Abo is another univer&s;ity, the capital of Swedi&s;h Finland, lying on the point, where the gulphs of Both|nia and Finland unite. It is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable town in the whole country, &s;urrounded with hills, and has a very commodious harbour. It is a bi&s;hops-&s;ee, has a hand&s;ome cathedral, a royal high-court of ju|dicature, and is the re&s;idence of the governor of the province. The city, which is not ill-built, has &s;ome few brick-hou&s;es, but the generality are of wood painted red, &s;o as to re&s;emble brick. The univer&s;ity con|tains about 300 &s;tudents, and its library about 3,000 volumes. Here is al&s;o a &s;chool for 300 &s;cholars; and a tolerable trade carried on in linen, corn, pro|vi&s;ions, planks, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Tornao, is another town of &s;ome note, though &s;mall, about 320 miles north-ea&s;t of Stockholm, where a con&s;iderable commerce is carried on between the Swedes and Laplanders, Ru&s;&s;ians and Norwegians; and is frequently vi&s;ited by &s;trangers, in order to &s;ee

the &s;un at midnight, which may be ob&s;erved by a &s;pectator, from the church-tower, in &s;ummer-time, ju&s;t above the horizon. There is an annual fair held here, frequented by the mountaineers, who barter fruit and other commodities, the produce of their country, for hardware and other nece&s;&s;aries. The fair continues a week, and is con&s;idered as a kind of Finland jubilee. When they depart for their own mountains, the arrang|ment of their deer, and loaded <HI>Pulchas,</HI> or &s;ledges, makes a very &s;ingular appearance; they do not tra|vel, in a mixed multitude, without order, but with much regularity and method. Precedency is always claimed and allowed to the &s;enior, the others follow in rotation, which pre&s;ents to the eye, a proce&s;&s;ion of deer and &s;ledges; the uncouth figures of men, and uten&s;ils of various kinds and &s;hapes, extending from &s;even to eight or nine miles in length. The figure of a rein-deer as de&s;cribed in the plate of Up&s;al, and that of the Lapland women holding it, were drawn from the life.</P>
<P>Tornao being &s;ituated on the confines of Finland, both the Finni&s;h and Lapland languages are here &s;po|ken; and the inhabitants, though far di&s;tant from po|li&s;hed &s;ociety, are far from being an unpoli&s;hed peo|ple. It is a beautiful, well-built city, con&s;i&s;ting of three &s;treets running parallel to each other, from north to &s;outh, inter&s;ected at right angles by 14 cro&s;s-&s;treets or lanes. The church is built with timber, and all

the hou&s;es have large oblong courts, two &s;ides of which are taken up with apartments, the other two with &s;tables, barns, &amp;c. All hou&s;es, in the adjoining country, are &s;o con&s;tructed, but tho&s;e have their court-yards &s;quare.</P>

But, the &s;nows continually falling, or ready to fall, hide the &s;un the few moments, he might be &s;een at mid-day.

<P>The pea&s;ants of Finland, are a rougher kind of people than the Swedes, dre&s;s, more like the Ru&s;&s;ians, but &s;till differ from them in their look and their dre&s;s. They have, for the mo&s;t part, fair complexions, and red hair. They &s;have their beards, wear their hair parted at top, and hanging to a con&s;iderable length on their &s;houlders; whereas the Ru&s;&s;ians have gener|ally dark complexions and hair, wear their beards and cut their hair &s;hort.</P>
<P>There is here a fine &s;almon-fi&s;hery, and their me|thod of taking it is this; they fir&s;t form an enclo&s;ure, 300 yards long and 100 broad, by driving poles down into the water, in the Tartar-manner, leaving only en|trance for the &s;almon; and this enclo&s;ure they drag with nets every two hours, and catch from forty to fifty at a time. A &s;almon of 21lb. weight may be bought here for 2s. 6d. Engli&s;h.</P>

500 miles from the capital, and &s;tands partly on a &s;mall i&s;land or two &s;urrounded with other i&s;lands. The&s;e, with the woods of oak, beach, and birch, on all &s;ides, ren|der the place extremely plea&s;ant. Here are two hand|&s;ome churches, and about 118,000 inhabitants. It is famous for the admiralty-college, and dock-yard, &s;epa|rated from the town, by a high, &s;tone-wall, and a &s;quadron of &s;hips of war, is here laid up. The dock is dug out of a mountain, to the depth of 80 feet, and is upwards of 300 feet long; it's entrance towards the &s;ea, has &s;ufficient depth of water, to float the large&s;t men of-war. It is clo&s;ed by two flood-gates, and can be emptied in ten hours, &s;o as to become quite dry.</P>
<P>The way into the town, from the main land, is over a dyke, and from thence along two wooden-bridges, joined by a barren rock. The &s;uburbs are fortified towards the land by a &s;tone-wall. A num|ber of new docks were begun in 1757, on a &s;tupen|plan, worthy of the ancient Romans, but are not yet completed. It is intended to con&s;truct 20 docks. A large ba&s;on, capable of holding two men-of-war, now fini&s;hed, is de&s;igned to communicate with two &s;maller ones, from each of which are to extend, like the radii of a circle, five rows of covered docks, each row to be &s;eparated by walls of &s;tone, and provided with gates, &s;o as to be filled, or emptied by pumps. Clo&s;e to the docks, magazines for naval &s;tores are to be con&s;tructed, and the whole enclo&s;ed with a &s;tone-wall. The

&s;hips of Carl&s;crone, are built chiefly by Engli&s;h arti|zans. Ships of very great burthen, are al&s;o built at Tornao.</P>
<P>Having thus given my readers a de&s;cription of the principal towns, I will endeavour to furni&s;h him with &s;ome idea of the &s;eats of the nobility, by de&s;cribing from Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> that of M <HI>De Ver&s;pot</HI> at Ra|ve&s;burg near Hor&s;ten. This nobleman had attended the government of Sweden, as a &s;enator, for twenty years; but was now retired to his country-&s;eat, and amu&s;ed him&s;elf with agriculture. The &s;ituation of his hou&s;e is very romantic. It is a large quadrangular building round a court, &s;ituated on the &s;ide of a va&s;t moun|tain, near the bottom, but high enough to command a great view in front; a large tract of falling ground parts the hou&s;e from a very beautiful lake, four miles long, and one and a half broad, in which are &s;everal lofty i&s;lands covered with wood; on one of which M. <HI>Ver&s;pot,</HI> has built a &s;ummer-hou&s;e, enchantingly &s;itu|ated. On the other &s;ides of this lake, the country is extremely various, either irregular vales, or hills ri&s;ing very boldly, and, in general, covered thick with wood. The whole country belongs entirely to him, for &s;everal miles every way. On the &s;ide of one of the hills, le&s;s &s;teep than the re&s;t, he has built a new village of more than 70 hou&s;es, which being all of a white-&s;tone, has a mo&s;t chearful appearance. In the lake he has a &s;mall &s;hip of two ma&s;ts, carrying ten bra&s;s-cannon;
<PB N="352" REF="369">
three &s;loops, and various boats. It put me more in mind, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> of a nobleman's ornamented &s;eat in a wild part of Britain, than any place I had ever &s;een, &s;ince I had left England; and yet he had travelled through all Flanders, Germany, Denmark and Sweden.</P>
<P>This gentleman (alive in 1770) lives in a very plentiful, and elegant &s;tyle. His table is &s;pread with all the delicacies which art can name, in &s;o northern a climate; he has the fine&s;t wines in Europe, and his lake furni&s;hes him with admirable fi&s;h. His e&s;tabli&s;hment may be gue&s;&s;ed, when it is &s;aid he has &s;eventy menial &s;ervants, in the hou&s;e, one of whom has the title of Captain of the guard, after the cu&s;tom of Sweden; who has a table, at which is the &s;ecretary and two chaplains, and be&s;ides this, there are five other tables kept; at the lowe&s;t of which the pea&s;ants who plea&s;e to come, are indi&s;criminately admitted, and their number is very often great, even to &s;ome hundreds; but that is only on fe&s;tivals; &s;ome however make free to vi&s;it him every day. The hou&s;e was built by him|&s;elf, the apartments are amazingly numerous and many of them very large, the large&s;t hou&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> belonging to a &s;ubject, I ever &s;aw. There is a &s;uite of eleven rooms fronting the lake, not one le&s;s than forty feet long, and thirty broad, all well-furni&s;hed, each with two chimney-pieces, in the Engli&s;h ta&s;te; the &s;toves are at each end of the room, and in all
<PB N="353" REF="370">
the&s;e &s;toves and chimnies, as well as in every room of the hou&s;e, are con&s;tant fires, all the winter.</P>
<P>I rode, continues the &s;ame author, about a mile and a half, over this gentleman's improvements, and found them ornamented. The fields were all regularly di&s;|po&s;ed in &s;quares or oblongs, and in high cultivation, the fences regular and admirable, and all the gates, rails, &amp;c. in good order, and painted white, as in &s;ome of our ornamented farms in England. The lands were covered with wheat, barley, oats, peas, beans, buck-wheat, carrots, turnips, trefoil, &amp;c. and meadow-gra&s;s, &s;upe|rior to mo&s;t Engli&s;h crops.</P>
<P>From this princely re&s;idence of M. <HI>Ver&s;pot,</HI> let us turn to the lot of a farmer, in more humble life. In the domain we have ju&s;t vi&s;ited, we may judge of the Swedi&s;h nobility, though all are perhaps, not &s;o weal|thy as M. <HI>Ver&s;pot,</HI> yet all might be equally happy and re&s;pectable. A nobleman, who &s;pends the greate&s;t part of his time in the mid&s;t of his tenants, with the be|nevolence and ho&s;pitality of a prince, mu&s;t feel his heart much more elated, than he who fritters away his time and fortune, in &s;elfi&s;h amu&s;ements, u&s;ele&s;s to him&s;elf and others.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> who travelled through many parts of Germany, Poland, and Ru&s;&s;ia; tells us that in no king|dom, except in England, had he ob&s;erved &s;o many
<PB N="354" REF="371">
&s;eats &s;cattered over the face of the country, as in Swe|den; where gentleman, of moderate fortunes, as with us, are accu&s;tomed, to re&s;ide, on their e&s;tates, in ru|ral plenty. The&s;e &s;eats being compo&s;ed of an a&s;&s;em|blage of wooden buildings, and painted red, make a neat appearance. Occupying a large extent of ground, they look at &s;ome di&s;tance, like &s;mall villages, and contribute greatly to the ornament of the country. They are mo&s;t frequent near the lakes, and are not uncommonly &s;ituated, in the mid&s;t of hanging-woods or broken rocks, &s;u&s;pended over the water.</P>
