<P>Three &s;pecimens of this rare &s;pecies were found together, con|cealed in the porous part of the Honey-comb Boletus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boletus Cellulo&s;us.</NOTE>. According to <HI>Herb&s;t. Archiv.</HI> it is u&s;ually found on plants of this genus. It is not &s;carce in Germany.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">The va&s;t addition of new &s;pecies of In&s;ects that <HI>Fabricius</HI> has made in his latter works, renders it difficult, and in &s;ome in&s;tances impo&s;&s;ible, to refer them to the &s;y&s;tem of <HI>Linnaeus;</HI> and though we would at all times more willingly refer any new kind to that &s;y&s;tem, and quote the Fabrician account among&s;t the &s;ynonyms, than adopt the new generic di&s;tinctions of Fabricius, or any other author, we mu&s;t not &s;acrifice propriety to predilection.

<P>The little In&s;ect before us may be referred to the Silpha genus of Linnaeus; but as his definition of the Silphae has been &s;ubjected to &s;o many objections and amendments of later authors, we forbear placing it among&s;t them.

<P><HI>Schoeffer</HI> divided the Silphae of Linnaeus into two genera, <HI>Silpha</HI> and <HI>Peltis. Geoffroy</HI> arranged &s;ome of them among&s;t his <HI>Derme&s;tides,</HI> and formed his genus <HI>Peltis</HI> of &s;uch as have the thorax and elytra &s;trongly margined, and perfoliated antennae. <HI>Geoffroy</HI> de&s;cribed our pre&s;ent &s;ubject under the name <HI>Tritoma. Fabricius</HI> afterwards, in his Manti&s;&s;a, arranged it under <HI>Ips,</HI> a new genus, formed from part of the <HI>Silphae</HI> of Linnaeus and <HI>Derme&s;tides</HI> of Geoffroy. In the Entomologia Sy&s;tematica, he has again &s;eparated the Ips, and made <HI>Mycetophagus</HI> a new genus of fifteen &s;pecies, in which he includes this In&s;ect.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">To tho&s;e who have adopted the &s;y&s;tem of Fabricius, it is unne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, that the fundamental part of his arrangement is taken from the mouth of the In&s;ect, which certainly is objectionable, be|cau&s;e that part is dry, and very frequently injured or de&s;troyed in In&s;ects that have been long in a cabinet, and is very &s;mall in mo&s;t kinds when allve; &s;o that, though we have followed his arrangement in the generic definition, we have been le&s;s prolix than a full eluci|dation of it might require.</P>

<P>This In&s;ect has been confounded with Phalaena lubricipeda by Linnaeus; he makes it the variety &bgr; after De Geer. In this he has been followed by many other authors; and though Roe&s;el, by giving the larva and pupa of each, in two di&s;tinct plates, evidently thought them different &s;pecies, his ob&s;ervations had no weight with other Naturali&s;ts; even Fabricius, in his <HI>Species In&s;ectorum,</HI> gives them

under one &s;pecific name. In his la&s;t work, <HI>Entomologia Sy&s;tematica,</HI> he has divided them, leaving the P. lubricipeda under its former name, and giving the &s;pecific name Menthra&s;tri to the white &s;ort, as had been done in <HI>Wien. Verz.</HI> 54. 2. Fabricius mentions it as a native of Germany, but from the figure of Roe&s;el no doubt can be entertained of its being preci&s;ely the &s;ame as our Engli&s;h &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The Caterpillars of both &s;orts are very general feeders; they will eat, oak, fruit trees, and wild plants of almo&s;t every kind. They are common in the &s;ummer, change to chry&s;alis about Augu&s;t, and appear in the winged &s;tate in May and June; but, there is more than one brood of them in the cour&s;e of the year, &s;o that the time of their appearance is uncertain. The Caterpillars change their &s;kins often; and change their colours at the &s;ame time. Tho&s;e of Phalaena Menthra&s;tri when &s;mall are a very light tran&s;parent brown: then brown with dark &s;tripes. It is not black till it is in the la&s;t &s;kin; and then, in many, the colour inclines to brown.</P>

<P>The Sphinx Celerio &s;tands pre-eminent in the li&s;t of the In&s;ects of this country, whether we con&s;ider its rarity, or uncommon beauty. Indeed, among&s;t the In&s;ects of this tribe that are brought from remote countries, even from A&s;ia, which boa&s;ts the mo&s;t &s;plendid &s;pecies, the varieties of Sphinx Celerio are often the mo&s;t beautiful; it mu&s;t however be owned, that, in countries where the
<PB N="26" REF="31">
climate, and luxuriance of the &s;oil contribute to enrich the juices of the plants on which the In&s;ects are nouri&s;hed, they are larger and their colours more vivid than any of the &s;ame kind produced in the northern countries of Europe.</P>
<P>Several years &s;ince, Mr. Francillon, of Norfolk-&s;treet in the Strand, had a living &s;pecimen of this In&s;ect brought to him: it was taken in Bunhill-fields burying-ground. It is &s;till pre&s;erved in his cabinet.</P>
<P>We have heard of other &s;pecimens being taken in this country; but the only in&s;tance we can quote with confidence is, that Mr. Latham, formerly of Dartford, and well known for his &s;cientific re&s;earches in natural hi&s;tory, has a &s;pecimen which was taken at Eltham, in Kent. Few collections of con&s;equence are without this In&s;ect, but they are in general natives of Germany.</P>
<P>Roe&s;el has given a figure of this Sphinx, with its larva and pupa; and, as we could never rea&s;onably expect to meet with it in the&s;e &s;tates in England, correct copies of his figures are given in Plate 191. The works of Roe&s;el are not in the hands of many; and, we are convinced that Plate will be acceptable to mo&s;t of our readers.</P>
<P>Sphinx Celerio is found on the vine.</P>

<P>The Sirex genus, as it &s;tands in the <HI>Entomologia Sy&s;tematica</HI> of Fabribius, includes only twenty-&s;ix &s;pecies; the&s;e are chiefly Euro|pean In&s;ects; but very few are natives of this country. The Sirex Gigas is found in the north of Europe; it has been taken in England, but very rarely: Yeats and Berkenhout mention it as a Briti&s;h &s;pecies, and we have been informed that it is &s;ometimes taken in Scotland. It is likely to be met with in Pine fore&s;ts, as the female &s;eems to prefer that wood to depo&s;it her eggs in. As no Engli&s;h Entomologi&s;t has attempted to de&s;cribe the peculiar habits of this tribe of In&s;ects, and e&s;pecially of Sirex Gigas, the following particulars may be &s;atisfactory to our readers.</P>
<P>The exten&s;ive fore&s;ts of Germany furni&s;hed the accurate Roe&s;el with many opportunities of finding and ob&s;erving the metamorpho&s;is of In&s;ects that are rarely to be found in other parts of Europe; and this enabled him to favour the world with a particular de&s;cription and &s;eries of figures of all the changes of Sirex Gigas, in the <HI>Bom|byliorum et Ve&s;parum</HI> of his <HI>In&s;ecten Belu&s;tigung.</HI> His figure of the female In&s;ect agrees with that we have given; the male is con&s;i|derably &s;maller, and has no &s;ting <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a generical di&s;tinction.</NOTE>. The &s;ting of the female con&s;i&s;ts of three parts, a &s;heath which divides into two parts or valves, and a fine in&s;trument &s;omewhat re&s;embling a needle; it is with this in|&s;trument it wounds its enemies, and the &s;ting is &s;aid to cau&s;e an excruciating pain. The micro&s;cope di&s;covers this part to be be&s;et with a number of very minute teeth, like the edge of a &s;aw: with this &s;ting the creature can pierce the wood of &s;ound trees; for we &s;u&s;pect, it does not always depo&s;it its eggs in &s;uch as are decayed, but rather in &s;uch as will &s;upply the larva with nouri&s;hment when it is hatched. The eggs are laid in clu&s;ters of two or three hundred together; they are of a pale yellow colour, about the thirtieth part of an inch in length, and &s;haped like a weaver's &s;huttle. The larva lives in the body of the tree, enlarging its habitation as it increa&s;es in &s;ize, for it never leaves the tree till it becomes a winged creature.
<PB N="41" REF="50">
The larva when full grown is about an inch and a quarter in length, and as thick as a goo&s;e quill. It is a heavy &s;luggi&s;h creature, almo&s;t cylindrical, the head very &s;mall, and the whole of an uniform pellucid yellowi&s;h colour. It has a &s;mall &s;pine at the end of the body like tho&s;e by which the larva of &s;ome &s;pinges are di&s;tingui&s;hed: this &s;pine is al&s;o a &s;triking character in the perfect Sirex. In the pupa the form of the winged creature is more vi&s;ible than in the larva &s;tate; it is of a browner colour than the larva, and the rudiment of the &s;ting and legs are very vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>In the early editions of the Sy&s;tema Naturae of Linnaeus, the &s;irices are arranged with the ichneumons in one genus; but later ob&s;ervations induced Linnaeus to make two genera of them in his la&s;t works. <HI>Geoffroy</HI> and Schaeffer have added &s;ome particulars to the Linnaean generic character; the&s;e principally relate to the num|ber of joints in the tar&s;i.</P>

Staunton, in his Hi&s;torical Account of the Emba&s;&s;y to China, mentions the Scolopendras and &s;corpions of that country: we have one &s;pecies of the former from China that ex|ceeds in magnitude every one of the genus we have &s;een from other parts of the world, and is perhaps the large&s;t known; it is near one foot in length, and is about one inch and an half round the girth of the body; the colour is of a fine &s;hining che&s;tnut brown, the legs inclining to yellow. The mo&s;t &s;ingular In&s;ect of this kind in England is the Scolopendra electrica, which &s;ometimes omits a &s;park or fla&s;h of light in the dark.</P>

<P>Simple as this little creature may appear to the general reader, the Entomologi&s;ts of this country e&s;teem it a rarity; for it was not imagined that England produced any &s;pecies of its &s;ingular genus till lately.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="68">Mr. Yeats, in his In&s;titutions of Entomology, mentions two &s;pe|cies of it that have been caught in this country; one by Mr. <HI>Hud&s;on,</HI> author of the <HI>Flora Anglica,</HI> the other by Mr. <HI>Grey.</HI> It is to be lamented, that he does not inform us preci&s;ely what were the &s;pecies. We learn that Fulgora Europaea was the In&s;ect taken by Mr. Hud&s;on; the other &s;eems undetermined.</P>
<P>The Fulgora Europaea very much re&s;embles &s;ome of the Cicadae in form and &s;ize, and have, therefore, been probably overlooked by Engli&s;h collectors of In&s;ects. Fabricius de&s;cribes it as a native of France and Germany; but it is very &s;carce in cabinets of foreign In&s;ects al&s;o. Perhaps it is not common in any country.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies does not exhibit any prominent features of its &s;in|gular genus; it has only a &s;mall conic hollow projection, or lantern, on the fore-part of the head, in&s;tead of the large projection that charac|teri&s;e mo&s;t of the exotic Fulgorae. It is not unlikely, however, that it may po&s;&s;e&s;s, though in a &s;mall degree, the a&s;toni&s;hing property of diffu&s;ing a radiance of light, which particularly di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>F. Lan|ternarid</HI> of South America, <HI>F. Candelaria</HI> of China, and &s;everal other &s;pecies. The light of &s;ome of the&s;e In&s;ects, according to the reports of Naturali&s;ts, and travellers in foreign countries, is &s;uffi|ciently vivid and con&s;tant to an&s;wer many purpo&s;es. Some of the Catholic mi&s;&s;ionaries a&s;&s;ert, that they could &s;ee di&s;tinctly to read and write by the light of one of them; and that &s;everal of them being fa&s;tened together, &s;erve to light the Indians when they travel in the night.</P>
<P>The ro&s;trum, or beak, through which the Fulgorae Europaea (like others of the &s;ame genus) &s;ucks its nutriment, &s;eems to form a part of the hollow projection in the front of the head; the tube lays clo&s;e to the belly, between the &s;ix legs. To explain the &s;ingular &s;tructure of this tube or ro&s;trum, we have given a front and a profile view of it as it appeared under the lens of a micro&s;cope.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="69">Our &s;pecimen is altogether green, except the wings; the recticu|lations of which are al&s;o of the &s;ame colour; and as in Sulzer's figure, the clear parts of the wings were &s;trongly tinged with green al&s;o.</P>

<P>As the Phalaenae are not remarkable for a variety of gay colours, like tho&s;e of the Papilio genus, an exception to a general rule in the beautiful &s;pecies before us, more &s;trongly demands our notice.

it appears to us more characteri&s;tic of the creature, which &s;hould have a lengthened articulated tail, terminated in a &s;harp crooked &s;ting, to warrant us in placing it among the Scorpions.

<P>The Caterpillar of this In&s;ect is generally found under the bark of the willow and &s;allow, or on the ro&s;e. It is probable there are two broods of it in the year, being &s;ometimes taken in the winged &s;tate early in the &s;ummer, but more commonly in the month of October; this is the more likely, as the Engli&s;h Aurelians fir&s;t called it the Herald, from an idea that its appearance warned them of ap|proaching winter.</P>
<P>This In&s;ect remains about twenty-eight days in the pupa &s;tate, the Caterpillar not being found till the beginning of September.</P>
