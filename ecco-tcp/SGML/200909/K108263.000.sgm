<HEAD>TRACT I. THE Ju&s;t Limitation of Slavery.</HEAD>
<P>THE opinion of the lords Hardwick and Talbot, which I laboured to refute in my Tract again&s;t <HI>Slavery in En|gland</HI>
<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">(1) A Repre&s;entation of the Inju&s;tice and dangerous Tendency of tolerating Slavery in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE>, (printed in 1769,) has &s;ince been effectually &s;et a&s;ide by a clear deter|mination, in the Court of King's-Bench
<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">(2) See Appendix.</NOTE>, in favour of <HI>James Somer&s;ett, a Ne|gro,</HI> again&s;t his former Ma&s;ter, <HI>C</HI>****** <HI>S</HI>******, e&s;q. in the year 1772.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">But it is not enough, that the Laws of England exclude <HI>Slavery</HI> merely <HI>from this i&s;land,</HI> whil&s;t the grand Enemy of man|kind triumphs in a toleration, <HI>throughout our Colonies,</HI> of the mo&s;t mon&s;trous <HI>op|pre&s;&s;ion</HI> to which human nature can be &s;ubjected!</P>
<P>And yet this abominable wickedne&s;s has not wanted advocates, who, in a va|riety of late publications, have attempted to palliate the guilt, and have even ven|tured to appeal to Scripture for the &s;up|port of their uncharitable preten&s;ions: &s;o that I am laid under a double obliga|tion to an&s;wer them, becau&s;e it is not the cau&s;e of <HI>Liberty</HI> alone for which I now contend, but for that which I have &s;till much more at heart, the honour of the holy Scriptures, the principles of which are entirely oppo&s;ite to the &s;elfi&s;h and
<PB N="3" REF="4">uncharitable preten&s;ions of our American Slaveholders and African Traders.</P>
<P>A late anonymous writer, who calls him&s;elf <HI>"An African Merchant,"</HI> re|marks, that,&mdash;<Q>By the Law of Mo&s;es, the I&s;raelites might purcha&s;e Slaves from the Heathens, and even their own people might become Slaves to their brethren.</Q> <HI>A Treati&s;e on the Trade from Great-Britain to Africa, &amp;c. by an African Merchant. P.</HI> 8 <HI>and</HI> 9.</P>
<P>Now, with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t part of his ob&s;ervation, it is true, indeed, that the I&s;raelites were expre&s;&s;ly permitted to keep Bond-Servants, or Slaves, <Q>of the <HI>Heathen,</HI> (or, more properly, of the <HI>Nations</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">) that <HI>were round about</HI></Q> <HI>them,</HI> and of <Q>the children of the &s;tran|gers that &s;ojourned among</Q> them. (Levit. xxv. 44 to 46.) But we mu&s;t re|member, that the&s;e <HI>Heathen,</HI> or <Q><HI>Na|tions
<PB N="4" REF="5">that were round about them;</HI></Q> were an abandoned race of people, already <HI>Slaves</HI> and <HI>wor&s;hippers</HI> of devils, and by them led to deba&s;e <HI>human nature,</HI> and to pollute them&s;elves with the mo&s;t un|natural and abominable vices: <Q>For in all the&s;e,</Q> (&s;aid the Almighty,) <Q>the nations are defiled which I ca&s;t out before you: and the Land is defiled; THEREFORE I do vi&s;it the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land it&s;elf vo|miteth out her inhabitants,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Again: <Q>For all the&s;e abominations have the men of the land done which were before you, and the land is defi|led,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See Levit. xviii. And the <HI>"children of the &s;trangers,"</HI> abovemen|tioned, were (probably) al&s;o of the &s;ame dete&s;table nations of Pale&s;tine, the Amo|rites, Canaanites, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which were ex|pre&s;&s;ly doomed to de&s;truction
<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">(3) <Q>Ob&s;erve thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amo|rite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebu&s;ite. Take heed to thy&s;elf, le&s;t thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goe&s;t, le&s;t it be for a &s;nare in the mid&s;t of thee,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Exod. xxxiv. 11 and 12.</NOTE>, and
<PB N="5" REF="6">that by the hand of the I&s;raelites, <HI>who were commanded to &s;hew them no pity</HI>
<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">(4) <Q>And thou &s;halt con&s;ume all the people which the Lord thy God &s;hall deliver thee: thine eye &s;hall have <HI>no pity upon them,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Deut. vii. 16. <Q>The Lord thy God will put out tho&s;e nations by little and little,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>The Lord thy God &s;hall deliver them unto thee, and &s;hall de&s;troy them with a migh|ty de&s;truction until they be de&s;troyed. And he &s;hall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou &s;halt de&s;troy their name from under heaven: there &s;hall no man be able to &s;tand before thee until thou have de&s;troyed them.</Q> Deut. vii. 23 and 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But no doctrine mu&s;t be drawn from the&s;e commands to <HI>execute God's vengeance</HI> upon the &s;aid wicked <HI>&s;trangers,</HI> without con&s;idering, at the &s;ame time, <HI>that very contrary treatment of &s;trangers</HI> which was <HI>equally</HI> enjoined in the Law: for the I&s;raelites were po&s;itively commanded not to <HI>vex</HI> or <HI>oppre&s;s a Stranger.</HI> <Q><HI>Thou
<PB N="6" REF="7">&s;halt love him as thy&s;elf,</HI></Q> &s;aid Mo&s;es, by the expre&s;s command of God. <Q>If a Stranger &s;ojourn with thee in your land, ye <HI>&s;hall not vex</HI></Q> (or <HI>oppre&s;s</HI>) <Q>him. But <HI>the Stranger</HI> that dwelleth with you &s;hall be unto you as one born among you, and <HI>thou &s;halt love him as thy&s;elf:</HI> for ye were <HI>Strangers</HI> in the land of Egypt.</Q> Levit. xix. 33.34. And again: <Q>The Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty and a terrible, which <HI>regardeth not per&s;ons</HI> nor taketh reward: he doth execute the judgement of the fatherle&s;s and widow, and <HI>loveth the Stranger,</HI> in giving him food and rai|ment. <HI>Love ye,</HI> therefore, <HI>the Stran|ger;</HI> for ye <HI>were Strangers</HI> in the land of Egypt.</Q> Deut. x. 17 to 19. In all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, and many others, the I&s;|raelites were reminded of their <HI>Bondage in Egypt:</HI> for &s;o the almighty <HI>Deli|verer</HI> from <HI>Slavery</HI> warned his people
<PB N="7" REF="8">to <HI>limit</HI> and moderate the <HI>bondage,</HI> which the Law permitted, by the remembrance of <HI>their own former bondage</HI> in a foreign land, and by a remembrance al&s;o of his great mercy <HI>in delivering them</HI> from that <HI>bondage:</HI> and he expre&s;&s;ly referred them to <HI>their own feelings,</HI> as they them&s;elves had experienced the intolerable yoke of Egyptian Tyranny! <Q>Thou &s;halt not <HI>oppre&s;s a Stranger;</HI> for ye know the heart of <HI>a &s;tranger,</HI> &s;eeing ye were <HI>&s;trangers</HI> in the land of Egypt.</Q> Exod. xxiii. 9. And again: <Q>Thou &s;halt remember that <HI>thou</HI> wa&s;t <HI>a Bond-man</HI> in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God <HI>redeemed thee:</HI></Q> Deut. xv. 15.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t, therefore, nece&s;&s;arily con|clude, when the&s;e very oppo&s;ite com|mands are con&s;idered, that the <HI>Heathen,</HI> or <HI>nations</HI> that were "ROUND ABOUT," or in the <HI>environs</HI> of the promi&s;ed land, and al&s;o the <HI>children of the &s;trangers,</HI> that
<PB N="8" REF="9">dwelt among them, mentioned at the &s;ame time, whom the I&s;raelites were per|mitted to retain <HI>in perpetual bondage,</HI> were not intended to be included and ranked under that general denomination of <HI>Strangers,</HI> to whom &s;o much real <HI>af|fection, benevolence,</HI> and <HI>con&s;ideration,</HI> are &s;trictly commanded, in the texts to which I have ju&s;t now referred. And, con&s;equently, it mu&s;t be allowed, that the particular nations, (the &s;even nations of Pale&s;tine, &s;ee Deut. vii. 1.) which were expre&s;&s;ly devoted to de&s;truction, were the only <HI>Strangers</HI> whom the Jews were permitted to hold in <HI>ab&s;olute Slavery;</HI> &s;o that the wicked practice of <HI>en&s;laving</HI> the poor <HI>African Negroes</HI> would have been as <HI>unlawful,</HI> under the Jewi&s;h Di&s;pen&s;ation, as it certainly is, now a-days, to Engli&s;hmen, and other &s;ub|jects of Great-Britain, that profe&s;s <HI>the Chri&s;tian Religion; in who&s;e con&s;ideration,</HI> ALL STRANGERS, from every
<PB N="9" REF="10">other part of the world, are, without doubt, entitled to be ranked, e&s;teemed, and beloved, <HI>as brethren,</HI> which I have el&s;ewhere particularly demon&s;trated; and which even the law of Mo&s;es expre&s;&s;ly commanded: &mdash; <Q>But <HI>the &s;tranger,</HI> that dwelleth with you, &s;hall be unto you <HI>as one born among you,</HI> and THOU SHALT LOVE HIM AS THY|SELF; for <HI>ye were &s;trangers</HI> in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.</Q> Levit. xix. 33 and 34.</P>
<P>This excellent &s;y&s;tem of benevolence to <HI>&s;trangers,</HI> which the I&s;raelites were &s;o &s;trictly enjoined to ob&s;erve, cannot, I ap|prehend, be otherwi&s;e reconciled with the permi&s;&s;ion to the I&s;raelites of retaining in perpetual bondage <HI>the heathen that were round about them,</HI> and the children of <HI>the &s;trangers</HI> that &s;ojourned among them: for, if this permi&s;&s;ion were to be ex|tended to <HI>&s;trangers in general,</HI> it would
<PB N="10" REF="11">&s;ubvert the expre&s;s command concerning <HI>brotherly love</HI> due to <HI>&s;trangers;</HI> becau&s;e a man cannot be &s;aid <HI>to love the &s;tranger as him&s;elf</HI> if he holds <HI>the &s;tranger</HI> and his pro|geny in a perpetual <HI>involuntary &s;ervitude.</HI> The ob&s;ervation therefore of the African Merchant, that <Q>THE ISRAELITES <HI>might purcha&s;e Slaves from the heathens,</HI></Q> will by no means ju&s;tify the <HI>en&s;laving</HI> of <HI>mo|dern heathens,</HI> by <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> or by any other nation now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. The I&s;rael|ites, at that time, might not only purcha&s;e Slaves of tho&s;e particular heathen nations, but they might al&s;o <HI>drive out the&s;e hea|then;</HI> (I mean, the&s;e which were particu|larly named;) nay, even <HI>kill</HI>
<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">(5) <Q>But of the cities of the&s;e people, which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou <HI>&s;halt &s;ave alive nothing that breatheth.</HI></Q> Deut. xx. 16.</NOTE> and <HI>ex|tirpate</HI> them, and <HI>take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ci|ties, hou&s;es,</HI> and <HI>lands.</HI> All the&s;e acts of violence <HI>might</HI> the I&s;raelites do <HI>without &s;in,</HI> though the like would ju&s;tly be e&s;teemed
<PB N="11" REF="12"><HI>murder</HI> and <HI>robbery,</HI> if practi&s;ed by any other nation, not under the like peculiar circum&s;tances: &s;o that the example of the I&s;raelites affords no excu&s;e for the uncha|ritable practices of the <HI>African Merchant</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-India Planter!</HI> The I&s;raelites had an expre&s;s commi&s;&s;ion
<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot"><P>(6) <Q>Now, therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.</Q> Numbers xxxi. 17. This was the judgement again&s;t the Midianiti&s;h pri&s;oners. The &s;even nations of Pale&s;tine were likewi&s;e &s;ubjected to the &s;ame condemnation. <Q>Thou &s;halt &s;mite them and utterly de&s;troy them: thou &s;halt make no cove|nant with them, <HI>nor &s;hew mercy unto them.</HI></Q> Deut. vii. 2. And a rea&s;on for this condemnation was plain|ly delivered in the fourth ver&s;e, to confirm the ju&s;tice of it: <Q>For they will turn away thy &s;on from follow|ing me, that they may &s;erve other gods.</Q></P>
<P>The Amalekites were al&s;o doomed to de&s;truction in the like manner: <Q>Thou &s;halt <HI>blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou &s;halt not forget it.</HI></Q> Deut. xxv. 19.</P></NOTE> to execute God's vengeance, <HI>without remor&s;e</HI>

And the I&s;raelites were expre&s;sly told, that it was not on their own account that this extraordinary authority was put into their hands, but on account of the <HI>abominable wick|edne&s;s</HI> of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the promi&s;ed land.&mdash;<Q>The land is defiled; therefore I do vi&s;it <HI>the iniquity there|of upon it, and the land it&s;elf vomiteth out her inhabit|ants.</HI></Q> Levit. xviii. 25.</P>

<P>The commi&s;&s;ion there given, however, was but <HI>temporary;</HI> and no other nation,
<PB N="13" REF="14">except God's peculiar people, was char|ged with the execution of it; and there|fore, though the Europeans have taken upon them&s;elves, for a long time pa&s;t, <HI>to attack, de&s;troy, drive out, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s, and en&s;lave,</HI> the poor ignorant <HI>Heathen,</HI> in many di&s;tant parts of the world, and may, perhaps, plead cu&s;tom and pre&s;crip|tion (to their &s;hame be it &s;aid) for their actions, yet, as they cannot, like the I&s;|raelites, produce an <HI>authentic written commandment from God</HI> for &s;uch proceed|ings, the offenders can no otherwi&s;e be e&s;teemed than as <HI>lawle&s;s robbers</HI> and <HI>op|pre&s;&s;ors,</HI> who have rea&s;on to expect <HI>a &s;e|vere retribution</HI> from God for their tyran|ny and oppre&s;&s;ion. It is unrea&s;onable, therefore, to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;evere treat|ment of the <HI>ancient Heathen,</HI> by the I&s;ra|elites, under <HI>the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Law,</HI> either in <HI>killing, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing,</HI> or <HI>en&s;laving,</HI> them, &s;hould ju&s;tify our <HI>modern</HI> acts of
<PB N="14" REF="15"><HI>violence</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> now that we profe&s;s obedience to the <HI>Go&s;pel of Peace.</HI></P>
<P>And, with re&s;pect to the &s;econd part of the African Merchant's ob&s;ervation, concerning the I&s;raelites, (<HI>viz.</HI> that even <Q>their own people might become Slaves to their brethren,</Q>) I mu&s;t remark, that he does not deal fairly by the Jewi&s;h Law, to quote that circum&s;tance, with|out mentioning, at the &s;ame time, <Q><HI>the Ju&s;t Limitation</HI></Q> to which it was &s;ub|ject, and the admirable provi&s;ion, in the &s;ame Law, again&s;t <HI>the involuntary &s;ervi|tude of brethren;</HI> becau&s;e no Hebrew could be made <HI>a Slave</HI> without <HI>his own con&s;ent,</HI> and even <HI>de&s;ire,</HI> which was to be <HI>"plainly"</HI> and <HI>openly</HI> declared in a court of <HI>record:</HI> &mdash; <Q>if the &s;ervant &s;hall <HI>plainly &s;ay,</HI> I love my ma&s;ter, my wife, and my children, <HI>I will not go out free,</HI> then</Q> (&s;ays the text) <Q>his ma&s;ter &s;hall bring him <HI>unto the Judges,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (whereby

But, without that <HI>public ac|knowledgement</HI> of <HI>voluntary con&s;ent before the Judges,</HI> the Hebrew ma&s;ter had no authority to bore the &s;ervant's ear
<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">(9) Yet our incon&s;iderate We&s;t-Indian and American Planters make no &s;cruple even of <HI>branding</HI> their poor Negro-&s;ervants with a <HI>hot iron,</HI> to mark them <HI>for per|petual Bondmen, again&s;t their will,</HI> though they are cer|tainly their <HI>Brethren</HI> in the eyes of GOD.

<PB N="16" REF="17">and as a <HI>&s;ojourner</HI> he &s;hall be with thee; <HI>(and)</HI> &s;hall &s;erve thee unto the year of jubilee: and <HI>(then)</HI> &s;hall he depart from thee, <HI>(both)</HI> he <HI>and his chil|dren</HI> with him;</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (and the rea&s;on of this command immediately follows;) "for they are <HI>my &s;ervants,</HI>" (&s;aid the Lord,) <Q>which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt:</Q> (i. e. <HI>which God him&s;elf delivered from Slavery:</HI>) <Q><HI>they &s;hall not be &s;old as Bond-men:</HI> thou &s;halt not rule over him with rigour, but <HI>&s;halt fear thy God.</HI></Q> Levit. xxv. 39 to 43.

<P>Thus it appears that the <HI>involuntary &s;ervitude</HI> of <HI>brethren</HI> is entirely incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the Jewi&s;h Law; which, there|fore,
<PB N="17" REF="18">is &s;o far from <HI>ju&s;tifying</HI> the <HI>African Merchant,</HI> that it ab&s;olutely <HI>condemns</HI> him. But he is &s;till more mi&s;taken, when he in&s;inuates that Slavery is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the Go&s;pel. <Q>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Saviour of mankind and Founder of our religion,</Q> (&s;ays he,) <Q>left the moral laws and civil rights of mankind upon their old foundations: his king|dom was not of this world, nor did he interfere with national laws: <HI>he did not repeal that of &s;laves,</HI> nor a&s;&s;ert an univer&s;al freedom, except from &s;in: with him bond and free were accepted, if they behaved <HI>righteou&s;ly.</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 9.</P>

The African Church fell away by degrees in the &s;ame manner, till it was totally lo&s;t in the mo&s;t barbarous ignorance, (except in Habe&s;&s;inia) for even tho&s;e Africans who are free from idolatry, and profe&s;s to wor&s;hip <HI>the true God,</HI> are, neverthele&s;s, en&s;nared and en&s;laved in the gro&s;s errors of <HI>Mahometani&s;m,</HI> to which a neglect of the nece&s;&s;ary Faith in the <HI>Divinity of Chri&s;t,</HI> and of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> has an apparent tendency!

He ar|gues, 'That men of little genius, and great bodily <HI>&s;trength, are by nature de&s;tined to &s;erve,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>better capacity to command;</HI> and that the natives of Greece, and of &s;ome other countries, being natu|rally &s;uperior in genius, have <HI>a natural right to</HI> em|pire; and that the re&s;t of mankind, being <HI>naturally &s;tupid,</HI> are de&s;tined to <HI>labour and &s;lavery,</HI>' (De Republ. lib. 1. cap. 5, 6.) This rea&s;oning is now, alas! of little advantage <HI>to Ari&s;totle's countrymen, who have for many ages been doomed to that &s;lavery,</HI> which, <HI>in his</HI> judgment, <HI>nature had de&s;tined them to impo&s;e on others;</HI> and many nations whom he would have con|&s;igned <HI>to everla&s;ting &s;tupidity,</HI> have &s;hown them&s;elves <HI>equal</HI> in genius to the mo&s;t <HI>exalted of human kind.</HI> It would have been more worthy of Ari&s;totle, to have inferred man's natural and univer&s;al right to liberty, from that natural and univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ion with which men de&s;ire it. He wanted, perhaps, to <HI>devi&s;e &s;ome excu&s;e for &s;ervitude;</HI> a practice which, to <HI>their eternal reproach,</HI> both Greeks and Romans tolerated even in the days of their glory.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> argues nearly in the &s;ame manner in regard to the &s;uperiority of white men over black. 'I am apt to &s;u&s;pect,' &s;ays he, 'the negroes, and in general all the other &s;pecies of men, (for there are four or five different kinds) to be naturally inferior to the whites. There <HI>never was</HI> a civilized nation of any other complexion than white, <HI>nor even any in|dividual</HI> eminent either in action or &s;peculation. <HI>No</HI> ingenious manufactures among them, <HI>no</HI> arts, <HI>no</HI> &s;ci|ences.&mdash;There are negro &s;laves di&s;per&s;ed all over Europe, of which <HI>none</HI> ever di&s;covered any &s;ymptoms of ingenuity.' (Hume's E&s;&s;ay on National Charac|ters.)&mdash;The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions are &s;trong; but I know not whether they have any thing el&s;e to recommend them. For, fir&s;t, though true, they would <HI>not prove the point in que&s;tion,</HI> except it were al&s;o proved, that the Africans and Americans, even though arts and &s;ciences were introduced among them, would &s;till re|main un&s;u&s;ceptible of cultivation. The <HI>inhabitants of Great Britain and France were as &s;avage two thou|&s;and years ago,</HI> as tho&s;e <HI>of Africa and America are at this day.</HI> To civilize a nation, is a work which it requires long time to accompli&s;h. And one may as <HI>well &s;ay of an infant, that he can never become a man, as of a nation now barbarous, that it never can be civi|lized.</HI> Secondly, of the facts here a&s;&s;erted, <HI>no man could have &s;ufficient evidence, except from a per&s;onal ac|quaintance with all the negroes that now are, or ever were, on the face of the earth.</HI> Tho&s;e people write no hi&s;tories; and all the reports of all the travellers that ever vi&s;ited them, will not amount to any thing like a proof of what is here affirmed. BUT, THIRD|LY, WE KNOW THAT THESE ASSERTIONS ARE NOT TRUE. The empires of Peru and Mexico could not have been governed, nor the metropolis of the latter built after &s;o &s;ingular a manner, in the middle of a lake, <HI>without men eminent both for action and &s;pecula|tion.</HI> Every body has heard of the magnificence, good government, and ingenuity, of the ancient Pe|ruvians. <HI>The Africans and Americans are known to have many ingenious manufactures and arts among them, which even Europeans</HI> would find it no ea&s;y matter <HI>to imitate.</HI> Sciences indeed they have none, becau&s;e they have no letters; but in oratory, &s;ome of them, particularly the Indians <HI>of the Five Nations,</HI> are &s;aid to be greatly our &s;uperiors. It will be readily allow|ed, that the condition of a &s;lave is not favourable to genius of any kind; and yet, <HI>the negro &s;laves di&s;per|&s;ed over Europe,</HI> have <HI>often di&s;covered &s;ymptoms of inge|nuity, notwith&s;tanding their unhappy circum&s;tances.</HI> They <HI>become excellent handicraft&s;men, and practical mu&s;icians,</HI> and indeed learn every thing their ma&s;ters are at pains to teach them, perfidy and debauchery not excepted. That a negro &s;lave, who can neither read nor write, nor &s;peak any European language, who is not permitted to do any thing but what his ma&s;ter commands, and who has not a &s;ingle friend on earth, but is univer&s;ally con&s;idered and treated as if he were of a &s;pecies inferior to the human;&mdash;that &s;uch a creature &s;hould &s;o di&s;tin&s;tui&s;h him&s;elf among Europeans, as to be talked of through the world for a man of genius, is &s;urely no rea&s;onable expectation. To &s;uppo&s;e him of an inferior &s;pecies, becau&s;e he does not thus di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf, is ju&s;t as rational, as to &s;uppo&s;e any private European of an inferior &s;pecies, becau&s;e he has not rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the condition of royalty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Had the Europeans been de&s;titute of the arts of writing, and working in iron, they might have re|mained to this day as barbarous as the natives of Africa and America. Nor is the invention of the&s;e arts to be a&s;cribed to our &s;uperior capacity. The ge|nius of the inventor is not always to be e&s;timated ac|cording to the importance of the invention. Gun|powder, and the mariner's compa&s;s, have produced wonderful revolutions in human affairs, and yet were accidental di&s;coveries. Such, probably, were the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays in writing, and working in iron. Suppo&s;e them the effects of contrivance; they were at lea&s;t contrived by a few individuals; and if they required a &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding, or of &s;pecies in the in|ventors, tho&s;e inventors, and their de&s;cendents, are the only per&s;ons who can lay claim to the honour of that &s;uperiority.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That every practice and &s;entiment is barbarous which is not according to the u&s;ages of modern Eu|rope, &s;eems to be a fundamental maxim with many of our critics and philo&s;ophers. Their remarks often put us in mind of the fable of the man and the lion. If negroes and Indians were di&s;po&s;ed to recriminate; if a Lucian or a Voltaire from the coa&s;t of Guinea, or from <HI>the Five Nations,</HI> were to pay us a vi&s;it; what a picture of European manners might he pre&s;ent to his countrymen at his return! Nor would carica|tura, or exaggeration, be nece&s;&s;ary to render it hi|deous. <HI>A plain hi&s;torical account of &s;ome of our mo&s;t fa&s;hionable duelli&s;ts, gamblers, and adulterers,</HI> (to name no more) would exhibit <HI>&s;pecimens of bruti&s;h barbarity and &s;otti&s;h infatuation,</HI> &s;uch as might vie with any that ever appeared in Kam&s;chatka, California, or the land of Hottentots.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>It is ea&s;y to &s;ee with what views &s;ome modern au|thors throw out the&s;e hints to prove the natural inferiori|ty</HI> of negroes. But let every friend to <HI>humanity pray, that they may be di&s;appointed.</HI> Britons are famous for genero&s;ity; a virtue in which it is ea&s;y for them to excel both the Romans and the Greeks. <HI>Let it never be &s;aid, that &s;lavery</HI> is countenanced by the brave&s;t and mo&s;t generous people on earth; by a people who are animated with that heroic pa&s;&s;ion, the love of liberty, beyond all nations ancient or modern; and the fame of who&s;e toil&s;ome, but unwearied, per&s;e|verance, <HI>in vindicating, at the expence of life and fortune, the &s;acred rights of mankind, will &s;trike terror into the hearts of &s;ycophants and tyrants,</HI> and excite the admiration and gratitude of all good men, to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</Q> E&s;&s;ay on Truth, P. 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463 and 464.</P></NOTE> We may la|ment

<P>Thus Chri&s;t has enlarged the antient Jewi&s;h doctrine of <HI>loving our neighbours

<P>No nation therefore whatever, can now be lawfully excluded as <HI>&s;trangers,</HI> according to that uncharitable &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>&s;tranger,</HI> in which the Jews were apt to di&s;tingui&s;h all other nations from them&s;elves; and, &s;ince <HI>all men</HI> are now to be e&s;teemed <Q><HI>brethren and

<NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">(33) Even white &s;ervants, <HI>Engli&s;h, Scotch, and Iri&s;h</HI> are frequently taken up by the <HI>&s;heriff</HI> and <HI>goalers</HI> without any warrant, or previous judgment what|ever, merely "on <HI>&s;u&s;picion of being &s;ervants;</HI>" and they are then <HI>advertized</HI> to be <HI>delivered up</HI> to their ty|rannical ma&s;ters; but though there is great inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion in taking up the&s;e poor people merely "on &s;u&s;picion <HI>of being &s;ervants,</HI>" yet it does not appear to be &s;o flagrant a breach of God's command before|mentioned, as the delivering up the poor runaway <HI>ne|groes,</HI> who are foreigners, and &s;trangers, and con&s;equently le&s;s capable of obtaining redre&s;s when they are really injured: the white &s;ervants are generally under&s;tood to be bound to their ma&s;ters only for a &s;hort limited time, either with their own con&s;ent by private contract, or as felons who are bani&s;hed their mother country after a fair trial <HI>by jury</HI> (which excludes any &s;u&s;picion of inju&s;tice) and are &s;old for a certain term to pay the expences of their pa&s;&s;age, &amp;c. whereby the right of &s;er|vice claimed from them by the ma&s;ter is more in the nature of a <HI>pecuniary debt</HI> than of ab&s;olute &s;lavery, &s;o that the white runaway &s;ervant may perhaps, <HI>as a debtor,</HI> be delivered up to his ma&s;ter without any direct breach of the law of God beforementioned; provided there is no apprehen&s;ion or probability of his being treated with cruelty on his return; or that the ma&s;ter would be li|able to exact more &s;ervice than is due; in which ca&s;e the law ought to afford protection and redre&s;s; but no pretences of this kind can ju&s;tify the <HI>delivering up</HI> a a negroe <HI>&s;tranger!</HI> The poor negroes are claimed <HI>for life,</HI> as an <HI>ab&s;olute property,</HI> though (to compare their ca&s;e with white &s;ervants) they never offended any member of our community either at home or abroad to ju&s;tify &s;uch a &s;evere puni&s;hment under <HI>Briti&s;h Govern|ment;</HI> neither are they capable of entering into &s;uch a <HI>legal contract</HI> for &s;ervice, as might ju&s;tify a ma&s;ter's claim to it, being ab&s;olutely incapacitated by <HI>unlawful dure&s;s,</HI> to <HI>enter into any contract</HI> as long as they are de|tained by force or fear in the <HI>Briti&s;h dominions</HI> (for which <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> to <HI>&s;trangers</HI> the <HI>Briti&s;h dominions</HI> mu&s;t &s;ooner or later receive a &s;evere <HI>retribution</HI>) and there|fore <HI>the delivering up to his ma&s;ter a negroe &s;ervant</HI> "THAT HAS ESCAPED FROM HIS MASTER," and has &s;ince regained his natural liberty, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be e&s;teemed a &s;hameful and notorious breach of God's law. <HI>Neverthele&s;s our publick prints inform us even of an Engli&s;h man of war</HI> and another ve&s;&s;el being lately &s;ent from Grenada to the Spani&s;h main, <Q>to claim &s;ome &s;laves that had made their e&s;cape from the I&s;lands,</Q> (&s;ee Gazetteer June 30, 1773) the writer of the pa|ragraph al&s;o expre&s;&s;es great di&s;appointment on ac|count of the i&s;&s;ue of this unwarrantable and di&s;graceful emba&s;&s;y: <Q><HI>in&s;tead of meeting with that ju&s;tice and civility which</HI> (&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> he) <HI>they had a right to expect, the Governors at both places, we are told, treated them with the greate&s;t haughtine&s;s and contempt and refu&s;ed to give them the &s;malle&s;t &s;atisfaction:</HI></Q> but alas the <HI>very ex|pectation</HI> of better treatment (upon an errand &s;o unlaw|ful in it&s;elf, and &s;o di&s;graceful to his Maje&s;ty's naval &s;ervice) is a proof of the mo&s;t deplorable degeneracy and ignorance!

<HEAD>Preface by the American Editor.</HEAD>
<P><Q>THE following E&s;&s;ay, though wrote, as the Author &s;ignifies, in ha&s;te, is thought to have &s;uch merit as to de&s;erve a publication.&mdash;The copy was &s;ent to one of the Writer's particular friends, whether for his own peculiar &s;a|tisfaction, or the pre&s;s, is uncertain; but as the &s;ubject is <HI>Liberty,</HI> &s;o it is expected the <HI>Freedom</HI> which is here taken, cannot ju&s;tly give him offence, or be unaccepta|ble to the public.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT was de&s;igned to confute a piece wrote by Thomas Thomp&s;on, M. A. &s;ome time fellow of C. C. C. entitled,</Q> <Q>The Afri|can trade for Negro Slaves &s;hewn to be con&s;i&s;tent with principles of humanity, and with the laws of revealed religion.</Q> 'Printed at Canterbury.'</P>
<P><Q>IN order to &s;hew that the E&s;&s;ay Writer has not mi&s;repre&s;ented the text, nor is &s;ingle in his ob&s;ervations upon it, the &s;en|timents of the Monthly Reviewers on that pamphlet in May, 1772, are here in&s;ert|ed.</Q></P>
<P>"We mu&s;t acknowledge," &s;ay they, <Q>that the branch of trade here under con&s;idera|tion,
<PB N="4" REF="71">is a &s;pecies of traffic which we have never been able to reconcile with the dic|tates of humanity, and much le&s;s with tho&s;e of religion. The principal argu|ment in its behalf &s;eems to be, the <HI>nece&s;|&s;ity</HI> of &s;uch a re&s;cource, in order to carry on the works in our plantations, which, we are told, it is otherwi&s;e impo&s;&s;ible to perform. But this, though the urgency of the ca&s;e may be very great, is not by any means &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the prac|tice. There is a farther con&s;ideration which has a plau&s;ible appearance, and may be thought to carry &s;ome weight; it is, that the merchant only purcha&s;es tho&s;e who were &s;laves before, and po&s;&s;i|bly may, rather than otherwi&s;e, render their lituation more tolerable. But it is well known, that the lot of our Slaves, when mo&s;t favourably con&s;idered, is very hard and mi&s;erable; be&s;ides which, &s;uch a trade is taking the advantage of the ig|norance and brutality of unenlightened na|tions, who are encouraged to war with each other for this very purpo&s;e, and, it is to be feared, are &s;ometimes tempted to &s;eize tho&s;e of their own tribes or families that they may obtain the hoped for ad|vantage: and it is owned, with regard to our merchants, that, upon occa&s;ion, they ob&s;erve the like practices, which are
<PB N="5" REF="72">thought to be allowable, becau&s;e they are done by way of repri&s;al for theft or damage committed by the natives. We were plea&s;ed, however, to meet with a pamphlet on the other &s;ide of the que&s;|tion; and we entered upon its peru&s;al with the hopes of finding &s;omewhat ad|vanced which might afford us &s;atisfaction on this difficult point. The writer ap|pears to be a &s;en&s;ible man, and capable of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the argument; but the li|mits to which he is confined, rendered his performance rather &s;uperficial. The plea he produces from the Jewi&s;h law is not, in our view of the matter, at all conclu&s;ive. The people of I&s;rael were under a <HI>theocracy,</HI> in which the Supreme Being was in a peculiar &s;en&s;e their King, and might therefore i&s;&s;ue forth &s;ome or|ders for them, which it would not be warrantable for another people, who were in different circum&s;tances, to ob&s;erve. Such, for in&s;tance, was the command given concerning the extirpation of the Canaanites, whom, the &s;overeign Arbiter of life and death might, if he had plea&s;ed, have de&s;troyed by plague or famine, or other of tho&s;e means which we term na|tural cau&s;es, and by which a wi&s;e Provi|dence fulfils its own purpo&s;es. But it would be unrea&s;onable to infer from the
<PB N="6" REF="73">manner in which the I&s;raelites dealt with the people of Canaan, that any other na|tions have a right to pur&s;ue the &s;ame me|thod. Neither can we imagine that St. Paul's exhortation to &s;ervants or &s;laves, upon their conver&s;ion, to continue in the &s;tate in which chri&s;tianity found them, affords any argument favourable to the practice here pleaded for. It is no more than &s;aying, that Chri&s;tianity did not particularly enter into the regulations of civil &s;ociety at that time; that it taught per&s;ons to be contented and diligent in their &s;tations: but certainly it did not forbid them, in a proper and lawful way, if it was in their power, to render their circum&s;tances more comfortable. Upon the whole, we mu&s;t own, that this little treati&s;e is not convincing to us, though, as different per&s;ons are differently affected by the &s;ame con&s;iderations, it may prove more &s;atisfactory to others.</Q></P>

<P><Q>THAT Slavery is not con&s;i&s;tent with the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, nor admi&s;&s;able in Great Britain, appears evidently by the late &s;olemn determination, in the court of

<HEAD>AN ESSAY on SLAVERY, Proving from Scripture its incon&s;i&s;ten|cy, with Humanity and Religion,</HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>By</HI> GRANVILLE SHARP.</BYLINE>
<P>A REVEREND author, Mr. Tho|mas Thomp&s;on, M. A. has late|ly attempted to prove <Q>that the Afri|can trade for Negroe Slaves is con|&s;i&s;tent with the principles of <HI>humanity</HI> and <HI>revealed religion.</HI></Q></P>
<P>FROM Leviticus xxv. 39 to 46, he draws his principle conclu&s;ion, viz. <Q>that the buying and &s;elling of Slaves <HI>is not con|trary to the law of nature,</HI> for (&s;ays
<PB N="19" REF="86">he) the <HI>Jewi&s;h con&s;titutions</HI> were &s;trictly therewith con&s;i&s;tent <HI>in all points:</HI> and the&s;e are in certain ca&s;es the rule by which is determined by <HI>learned lawyers</HI> and ca&s;ui&s;ts, what is, or is not, <HI>contrary to nature.</HI></Q> I have not lei&s;ure to follow this author me|thodically, but will, neverthele&s;s, ex|amine his ground <HI>in a general way,</HI> in order to prevent any ill u&s;e that may be made of it again&s;t the important que&s;tion now depending before the judges.
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>(a)</HI> Meaning I &s;uppo&s;e, (&s;ays the American editor) the ca&s;e of Somer&s;et, which then depended.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE reverend Mr. Thomp&s;on's <HI>pre|mi&s;es are not true,</HI> for the Jewi&s;h con|&s;titutions <HI>were not "&s;trictly con&s;i&s;tent"</HI> with the <HI>law of nature</HI> in all points, as he &s;uppo&s;es, and con&s;equently his prin|cipal <HI>conclu&s;ion</HI> thereupon is erroneous. Many things were formerly tolerated among the I&s;raelites, merely through
<PB N="20" REF="87">the mercy and forbearance of God, in con&s;ideration of their extreme frailty and inability, at that time, to bear a more perfect &s;y&s;tem of law. Other laws there are in the five books (be&s;ides the ceremonial laws now abrogated) which are merely <HI>municipal,</HI> being adapted to the peculiar polity of the I&s;raeliti&s;h com|monwealth, on account of its &s;ituation in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t barbarous na|tions, whom the Hebrews were at all times but too much inclined to immi|tate.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;al <HI>moral laws</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>natural equity</HI> are, indeed, every where plentifully inter&s;per&s;ed among the <HI>peculiar laws</HI> abovementioned; but they may very ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed by every &s;incere Chri&s;tian, who examines them with <HI>a liberal mind,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>benevolent purpo&s;e</HI> of the Divine Author
<PB N="21" REF="88">is <HI>always apparent</HI> in tho&s;e laws which are to be <HI>eternally binding;</HI> for <Q>it is <HI>the rea&s;on</HI> of the law which con&s;ti|tutes the <HI>life of the law,</HI></Q> according to an allowed maxim of our own country, "Ratio Legis e&s;t anima Legis," (Jenk. Cent. 45.) And with re&s;pect to the&s;e <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>equitable</HI> laws, I will readily agree with the Reverend Mr. Thomp|&s;on, that they are the be&s;t rule by which <Q>learned judges and ca&s;ui&s;ts can deter|mine what is, or is not, <HI>contrary to nature.</HI></Q></P>
<P>BUT I will now give a few examples of laws, which are in <HI>them&s;elves contra|ry to nature or natural equity,</HI> in order to &s;hew that Mr. Thomp&s;on's <HI>premi&s;es</HI> are totally fal&s;e:</P>
<P>THE I&s;raelites were expre&s;sly <HI>permitted by the law of Mo&s;es</HI> to give a bill of di|vorce
<PB N="22" REF="89">to their wives whenever they plea&s;ed, and to marry <HI>other women;</HI> and the women who were put away, were al&s;o expre&s;sly permitted, by the Mo&s;aic law, <HI>to marry again,</HI> during the lives of their for mer hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>ALL which practices were manife&s;t|ly contrary to <HI>the law of nature</HI> in its purity, though not perhaps to <HI>the nature of our corrupt affections and de&s;ires;</HI> for Chri&s;t him&s;elf declared, that <Q><HI>from the beginning it was not &s;o,</HI></Q> Matt. xix 8, 9. and at the &s;ame time our Lord infor|med the Jews, that <Q>Mo&s;es, becau&s;e of <HI>the hardne&s;s of their hearts,</HI> &s;uffered them to put away their wives.</Q></P>
<P>NEITHER was it <HI>according to the law of nature,</HI> that the Jews were <HI>permitted</HI> in their behaviour and dealings, to make a partial di&s;tinction between their
<PB N="23" REF="90"><HI>brethren</HI> of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and &s;trangers. This national partiality was not, indeed, either commanded or re|commended in their law&mdash;but it was clearly <HI>permitted</HI> or <HI>tolerated,</HI> and pro|bably, for the &s;ame rea&s;on as the la&s;t mentioned in&s;tance&mdash;<Q>thou <HI>&s;halt not lend</HI> upon u&s;ury to <HI>thy brother,</HI></Q> &amp;c.&mdash;<Q>unto <HI>a &s;tranger</HI> thou maye&s;t <HI>lend upon u&s;ury</HI> &amp;c. Deut. xxiii. 19.&mdash;Again&mdash; of <HI>a foreigner</HI> thou <HI>maye&s;t exact;</HI></Q> (that is, what&s;oever <HI>has been lent,</HI> as ap|pears by the preceding ver&s;es) but that which is, <Q>thine, <HI>with thy brother,</HI> thine hand &s;hall relea&s;e,</Q> Deut. xv. 3</P>
<P>Now all the&s;e laws were <HI>"contrary to the law of nature"</HI> or <HI>"natural equi|ty,"</HI> (whatever Mr. Thomp&s;on, may think) and were certainly, annulled or rather <HI>&s;uper&s;eded,</HI> as it were, by the more perfect doctrines of <HI>univer&s;al be|nevolence</HI> taught by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who

<P><Q>BUT whether I &s;hall go thither or return home, I am yet undeter|mined; indeed, no where &s;hall I &s;tay long from England, for I had much ra|ther enjoy the bare nece&s;&s;aries of life there, than the mo&s;t affluent circum&s;tan|ces in this country of mo&s;t wretched Sla|very; which alone would render the life of any humane man mo&s;t mi&s;erable. There are four things under the Sun, which I equally abhor and abominate, viz. <HI>Slavery</HI> (under which I comprehend all cruelty, oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice) and <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s, pride</HI> and <HI>impudence,</HI> all which abound here in a mon&s;trous de|gree.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The puni&s;hments of the poor negroes and convicts, are beyond all conception, being entirely &s;ubject to the will of their
<PB N="43" REF="110">&s;avage and brutal ma&s;ters, they are often puni&s;hed for not doing more than &s;trength and nature will admit of, and &s;ometimes becau&s;e they can't on every occa&s;ion fall in with their wanton and capricious hu|mours. One common puni&s;hment, is to flea their backs with cow hides, or other in&s;truments of barbarity, and then pour on hot rum, &s;uperinduced with brine or pickle, rub'd in with a corn hu&s;k, in the &s;corching heat of the Sun. For cer|tain, if your judges were &s;en&s;ible of the &s;hocking treatment of the convicts here, they would hang every one of them, as an infinitely le&s;s puni&s;hment, and tran&s;|port only tho&s;e, who&s;e crimes de&s;erve the &s;evere&s;t death.

<HEAD>A Letter from <HI>Granville Sharp,</HI> to <HI>Ja|cob Bryant,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> concerning the De&s;cent of the Negroes.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>I Have conceived a very high opinion of your abilities, by peru&s;ing your learned account of <HI>Egypt, and the Shep|herd Kings,</HI> &amp;c. and as you &s;eem to have &s;tudied, very particularly, the hi&s;tory of the <HI>Cu&s;eans</HI> and antient <HI>Arabians,</HI> you can (I apprehend) ea&s;ily re&s;olve &s;ome doubts, relating thereto, which occurred to me on reading your book.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I HAD always &s;uppo&s;ed that black men in general were de&s;cended from <HI>Cu&s;h,</HI> be|cau&s;e a di&s;tinction in colour from the re&s;t of mankind, &s;eems to have been particu|larly attributed to his de&s;cendants, <HI>the Cu|&s;him,</HI> even to a proverb.</Q> <Q><HI>Can the Cu&s;hi</HI> (commonly rendered Ethiopian) <HI>change his Skin,</HI></Q> &amp;c. (Jeremiah, xiii. 23.) and
<PB N="45" REF="112"><Q>therefore I concluded that all negroes as well <HI>Ea&s;t Indian</HI> as <HI>African,</HI> are en|titled to the general name of <HI>Cu&s;him,</HI> as being, probably, de&s;cended from dif|ferent branches of the &s;ame &s;tock, be|cau&s;e the proverb is equally applicable to both, with re&s;pect to their complection, tho' in many re&s;pects they are very dif|ferent. But in p. 254, of your learned work, where you are &s;peaking of the <HI>Cu|&s;eans</HI> in general, you &s;ay, that they are <Q>to be found within the tropics, almo&s;t as low as the Gold coa&s;t,</Q> &amp;c. as if you apprehended, that the negroes on the Gold coa&s;t, and below it, <HI>were not de|&s;cended from Cu&s;h.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Now, Sir, I &s;hall think my&s;elf greatly obliged, if you will be plea&s;ed to inform me, whether you really have any particu|lar rea&s;on to apprehend that the negroes on the coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea</HI> (from whence our plantations are mo&s;t commonly &s;upplied) are de&s;cended from any other &s;tock? Or whether their de&s;cent can at all be traced?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I AM far from having any particular e&s;teem for the negroes, but as I think my&s;elf <HI>obliged</HI> to con&s;ider them as <HI>Men,</HI> I am certainly <HI>obliged,</HI> al&s;o, to u&s;e my be&s;t endeavours to prevent their being treated <HI>as bea&s;ts,</HI> by our unchri&s;tian countrymen, who deny them the privileges of <HI>human Nature;</HI> and, in order to excu&s;e their
<PB N="46" REF="113">own <HI>brutality,</HI> will &s;carcely allow that negroes are <HI>human Beings.</HI></Q></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Cypenham,</HI> <DATE><HI>20th Octr.</HI> 1772.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>I MOST &s;incerely wi&s;h you &s;ucce&s;s in your laudable purpo&s;e: and am very glad to find in the&s;e ba&s;e times, that there is a per&s;on, who will &s;tand up in defence of human nature; and not &s;uffer it to be limited to a &s;et of features and complexion. There is nothing, I believe, in my wri|tings, that can affect any argument, which you may think proper to urge in favour of tho&s;e, whom you would patro|nize. But to take away all embarra&s;|ment, and uncertainty, I will give you my opinion upon the &s;ubject, which you have &s;tated to me in your letter, in re&s;pect to the origin of the Nigritae or Negroes. You &s;eem to think, that all, who are of that very deep tint, which is
<PB N="48" REF="115">ob&s;ervable in the natives upon the coa&s;t of Guinea, are the offspring of <HI>Chus:</HI> and all black men in general are of the &s;ame origin. To this I take the liberty to an&s;wer, that all the natives of <HI>Africa</HI> are more or le&s;s &s;wart: and even among the negroes there are a great variety of tints, from a light copper colour to the darke&s;t black. All the inhabitants of this va&s;t continent are a&s;&s;uredly the &s;ons of <HI>Ham:</HI> but not equally de&s;cended from <HI>Chus.</HI> For though his po&s;terity was very dark, yet many of the collateral branches were of as deep a die: and <HI>Africa</HI> was peopled from <HI>Ham,</HI> by more families than one. It was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;ome of them, as there is good grounds to &s;ur|mi&s;e, before the <HI>Cu&s;hites</HI> came into <HI>Egypt.</HI> We learn from &s;cripture, that <HI>Ham</HI> had four &s;ons, <HI>Chus, Mizraim, Phut</HI> and <HI>Ca|naan,</HI> Gen. x. v. 6. <HI>Canaan</HI> occupied <HI>Pa|le&s;tine,</HI> and the country called by his by his name: <HI>Mizraim Egypt:</HI> But <HI>Phut</HI> pa&s;&s;ed deep into <HI>Africa,</HI> and, I believe, mo&s;t of the nations in that part of the world are de&s;cended from him: at lea&s;t more than from any other per&s;on. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, <Q><HI>that Phut was the foun|der of the nations in Libya,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Jo&s;ephus, Antq. lib. 1 c. 7.</NOTE> and the
<PB N="49" REF="116">people were from him called,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) <HI>Phuti.</HI></Q> By <HI>Libya</HI> he under&s;tands, as the <HI>Greeks</HI> did, <HI>Africa</HI> in general: for the particular country, called <HI>Libya</HI> proper, was peopled by the <HI>Lubim,</HI> or <HI>Lehabim,</HI> one of the branches from <HI>Mizraim,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. Chron. Pa&s;chale, p. 29.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE &s;ons of <HI>Phut,</HI> &s;ettled in <HI>Maurita|nia,</HI> where was a country called <HI>Phutia,</HI> and a river of the like denomination. <Q>Mauritaniae Fluvius u&s;que ad prae&s;ens tempus <HI>Phut</HI> dicitur, omni&s;que circa eum regio <HI>Phuten&s;is.</HI> (Hieron^^s. Tradit. Hebraeae.) &mdash; Amnem, quem vocant&punc; <HI>Fut:</HI></Q> (Pliny, lib. 5. c. i.)&mdash;Some of this family &s;ettled above Egypt, near Aethi|opia, and were &s;tiled Troglodytae. <GAP DESC="foreign"> syncellus, p. 47. many of them pa&s;&s;ed inland, and peopled the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> country. In proce&s;s of time, (after their expul&s;ion from <HI>Egypt,</HI>) the &s;ons of <HI>Chus</HI> made &s;ettlements upon the &s;ea coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> and came into <HI>Mauritania.</HI> Hence we find traces of them al&s;o in the names of places, &s;uch as <HI>Churis, Chu&s;ares,</HI> upon the coa&s;t: and a river <HI>Cu&s;a,</HI> and a city <HI>Cotta,</HI> together with a promontory <HI>Cotis</HI> in <HI>Mauritania,</HI> all denominated from <HI>Chus;</HI> who at dif|ferent times and by different people was called <HI>Chus, Cuth, Co&s;h</HI> and <HI>Cotis.</HI> The river <HI>Cu&s;a</HI> is mentioned by <HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. 5.
<PB N="50" REF="117">c. 1. and by <HI>Ptolomey.</HI> Many ages after the&s;e &s;ettlements, there was another ir|ruption of the <HI>Cu&s;hites</HI> into the&s;e parts, under the name of <HI>Saracens</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Query.</HI>&mdash;Whether the <HI>Saracens</HI> may not rather be &s;aid to be of the line of <HI>Shem,</HI> as being de&s;cended from <HI>Abraham?</HI>&mdash;Though indeed, both the mother and the wi&s;e of <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> were <HI>Egyptiant.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Moors;</HI> who over ran <HI>Africa,</HI> to the very extre|mities of mount <HI>Atlas.</HI> They pa&s;&s;ed over, and conquered <HI>Spain</HI> to the north: and they extended them&s;elves &s;outhward, as I &s;aid in my treati&s;e, to the rivers <HI>Sene|gal</HI> and <HI>Gambia,</HI> and as low as the <HI>Gold Coa&s;t.</HI> I mentioned this, becau&s;e I do not think, that they proceeded much far|ther: mo&s;t of the nations to the &s;outh being, as I imagine, of the race of <HI>Phut.</HI> The very country upon the river <HI>Gambia</HI> on one &s;ide, is at this day called <HI>Phuta,</HI> of of which <HI>Bluet,</HI> in his hi&s;tory of <HI>Juba Ben Solomon,</HI> gives an account.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is not po&s;&s;ible to di&s;criminate at this aera of time the &s;everal ca&s;ts among the black nations, but I &s;hould think, that we may be pretty certain, that they were not all <HI>Cu&s;him,</HI> or <HI>Cu&s;eans.</HI> The Negroes are woolly headed; and &s;o were &s;ome of the <HI>Aethiopes</HI> or <HI>Cu&s;him:</HI> but nothing can be inferred from this: for many of the latter had long hair, as we learn from <HI>He|rodotus,</HI> lib. 7. c. 70. <GAP DESC="foreign">. We
<PB N="51" REF="118">find from <HI>Marcellmus,</HI> that the <HI>Egyp|tians</HI> were <HI>Cri&s;pi,</HI> and had a tendency to woolly hair: &s;o that this circum&s;tance can|not always be looked upon as a family characteri&s;tic.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIS, Sir, is my opinion concerning the people in que&s;tion, which I &s;ubmit to your con&s;ideration, merely as matter of opinion: for I cannot pretend to &s;peak with certainty. It makes very little dif|ference in re&s;pect to the good cau&s;e, which your humanity prompts you to e&s;|pou&s;e, whether the Nigritae are <HI>Phutians,</HI> or <HI>Cu&s;hites.</HI> They are certainly the &s;ons of <HI>Ham:</HI> and, what is more to the pur|po&s;e, they are the work man&s;hip of God&punc; formed in his image with a living Soul; as well as our&s;elves. Con&s;equently they de&s;erve better treatment, than they have generally experienced from tho&s;e, who look upon them&s;elves, as more enlighten|ed, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a greater degree of humanity.

<P><Q>LET <HI>private intere&s;t</HI> therefore give place to <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>right,</HI> which will mo&s;t effec|tually admini&s;ter to the public &s;afety.</Q></P>
<P><Q>LET it be remembered that many of the negroes are natives of the colonies, and con&s;equently have <HI>a natural right</HI> to a <HI>free exi&s;tence</HI> therein, as well as the Land|holders them&s;elves.

<P><Q>SUPPOSE the value of every &s;lave now in the colonies, was to be fairly e&s;timated, by juries appointed for that purpo&s;e, and the value to be entered, under their in&s;pection, (as a pecuniary <HI>debt</HI> due from each negroe to his ma&s;ter,) in a public regi&s;ter for each di&s;trict. Suppo&s;e al&s;o that the landholders,
<PB N="58" REF="125">who do not occupy all their grounds, were advi&s;ed to divide what lands they can &s;pare into <HI>compact little farms,</HI> with a &s;mall wooden cottage to each, which &s;hould be allotted to tho&s;e negroes only, who are natives of the colony, or el&s;e have been &s;o long in it, that their di&s;po&s;itions are &s;ufficiently known, whether or not they may &s;afely be entru&s;t|ed with their liberty. Let &s;uch negroes hold the&s;e &s;mall portions of land by lea&s;es, for a certain term of years; and at equitable rents, to be paid in &s;uch portions of <HI>the produce</HI> from time to time, as &s;hall be thought mo&s;t rea&s;onable, leaving the ten|ants a moderate gain, (be&s;ides their nece&s;|&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence) to encourage indu&s;try, and yet &s;o as to yield the landlords a due profit from each portion of their e&s;tates, be&s;ides an adequate allowance to reimbur&s;e (within the limited time) not only the regi&s;tered price of their quondam &s;laves, but al&s;o whatever &s;ums they may have advanced to|wards the expence of <HI>building,</HI> of <HI>implements,</HI> of <HI>live &s;tock,</HI> of <HI>&s;eed, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> the amount of which ought to be added to the fir&s;t debt and regi&s;tered, in like manner, before the lea&s;es are executed.

<PB N="60" REF="127">and &s;ervants; and in proce&s;s of time, in&s;tead of <HI>wretched &s;laves,</HI> a new and u&s;e|ful order of men, at pre&s;ent unknown in America, (where every <HI>freeman</HI> cultivates his own ground only) would be e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t you; I mean a hardy body of <HI>free pea&s;ants,</HI> &s;erving either as <HI>tru&s;ty ten|ants</HI> or <HI>farmers,</HI> to improve the e&s;tates of landed gentlemen, or el&s;e as <HI>laborious cot|tagers,</HI> who might be employed with in|finite advantage to the neighbourhood, wherever e&s;tabli&s;hed, e&s;pecially if they were encouraged by an allotment of a &s;mall patch of land for a potatoe ground or garden, with a right of pa&s;ture for a little live &s;tock upon &s;ome common field in the neighbourhood of their little cot|tages.&mdash;Landholders by this means would have their e&s;tates better peopled and im|proved, and yet avoid the guilt and dan|ger of oppre&s;&s;ion. In the mean while, the hours of labour &s;hould be uniformly regu|lated, to prevent the oppre&s;&s;ion of avari|cious exactors, and the danger of di&s;con|tent: and &s;chools &s;hould be opened in every di&s;trict, to give the poor labourers and their children, &s;ome general ideas of morality and religious knowledge, which con&s;titute the mo&s;t effectual <HI>bond of peace.</HI> The&s;e regulations I mention only by way of hint: you have the &s;ame earne&s;t regard

<HEAD>A Copy of what <Q><HI>is &s;aid</HI> to be the &s;ub&s;tance of Lord <HI>Mansfield</HI>'s &s;peech in the ca&s;e of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and <HI>Knowles:</HI></Q></HEAD>
<P>ON Monday the 22d June, in Trinity term, 1772, the court of <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Bench,</HI> proceeded to give judgement in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and <HI>Knowles,</HI> upon the re|turn of the Habeas Corpus. LORD MANS|FIELD fir&s;t &s;tated the return; and then &s;poke to the following purport, which is taken from the &s;econd edition of a Tract, printed in 1773, intituled, <Q><HI>Con&s;idera|tions on the Negroe Cau&s;e, &s;o called, ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the right honourable lord</HI> Mans|field, <HI>lord chief ju&s;tice of the court of King's Bench, by</HI> SAMUEL ESTWICK, <HI>A. M. A&s;&s;i&s;tant Agent for the i&s;land of</HI> Barbadoes.</Q> page vii. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>WE pay due attention to the opinion of Sir <HI>Philip Yorke</HI> and Mr. <HI>Talbot,</HI> in the year 1729, by which they pledged them&s;elves to the Briti&s;h planters for the
<PB N="66" REF="133">legal con&s;equences of bringing Negroe-&s;laves into this kingdom, or their being baptiz|ed; which opinion was repeated and re|cognized by lord Hardwicke, &s;itting as chancellor, on the 19th of October, 1749, to the following effect: he &s;aid,</Q> <Q>that trover would lay for a negroe-&s;lave: that a notion prevailed, that if a &s;lave came into England, or became a Chri&s;tian, he there|by became emancipated; but there was no foundation in law for &s;uch a notion: that when he and Lord Talbot were attorney and &s;olicitor general, this notion of a &s;lave becoming free by being baptized per|vailed &s;o &s;trongly, that the planters indu&s;|triou&s;ly prevented their becoming chri&s;|tians: upon which their opinion was taken; <HI>and upon their be&s;t con&s;ideration they were both clearly of opinion,</HI> that a &s;lave did not in the lea&s;t alter his &s;ituation or &s;tate to|wards his ma&s;ter or <HI>owner,</HI> either by be|ing chri&s;tened, or coming to England: that though the &s;tatute of Charles II. had aboli&s;hed</Q> (<HI>homage</HI>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">(&Dagger;) See a part of my lord <HI>Mansfield</HI>'s &s;peech printed in the Appendix, (p. 11.) of <Q><HI>a Treati&s;e upon the Trade from</HI> Great Britain <HI>to</HI> Africa, <HI>by an African merchant,</HI></Q> wherein this word <HI>"homage"</HI> is in&s;erted.</NOTE>) <Q>tenure &s;o far, that no man could be a <HI>Villein regardant;</HI> yet if he would acknowledge him&s;elf a <HI>Villein</HI> engro&s;&s;ed in any court of record, he
<PB N="67" REF="134">knew of no way by which he could be en|titled to his freedom, without the con&s;ent of his ma&s;ter.</Q> <Q>We feel the force of the inconveniences and con&s;equences that will follow the deci&s;ion of this que&s;tion: yet all of us are &s;o clearly of one opinion upon the <HI>only</HI> que&s;tion before us, that we think we ought to give judgment without adjourning the matter to be argued before all the judges, as u&s;ual in the habeas cor|pus, and as we at fir&s;t intimated an inten|tion of doing in this ca&s;e. The only que&s;|tion then is, <HI>Is the cau&s;e returned &s;ufficient for the remanding him? If not,</HI> he mu&s;t be di&s;charged. The cau&s;e returned is, the <HI>&s;lave</HI> ab&s;ented him&s;elf and departed from his ma&s;ter's &s;ervice, and refu&s;ed to return and &s;erve him during his &s;tay in <HI>England;</HI> whereupon, by his ma&s;ter's orders, he was put on board the &s;hip by force, and there detained in &s;ecure cu&s;tody, to be carried out of the kingdom and &s;old. So high an act of dominion mu&s;t derive its autho|rity, if any &s;uch it has, from the law of the kingdom <HI>where</HI> executed. A foreig|ner cannot be impri&s;oned <HI>here</HI> on the au|thority of any law exi&s;ting in his own coun|try. The power of a ma&s;ter over his &s;er|vant is different in all countries, more or le&s;s limited or exten&s;ive, the exerci&s;e of of it therefore mu&s;t always be regulated
<PB N="68" REF="135">by the laws of the place where exerci&s;ed. The &s;tate of &s;lavery is of &s;uch a nature, that it is incapable of being now intro|duced by courts of ju&s;tice upon mere rea|&s;oning, or inferences from any principles natural or political; it mu&s;t take its ri&s;e from <HI>po&s;itive law;</HI> the origin of it can in no country or age be traced back to any other &s;ource. Immemorial u&s;age pre&s;erves the memory of <HI>po&s;itive law</HI> long after all traces of the occa&s;ion, rea&s;on, authority, and time of its introduction, are lo&s;t, and in A CASE SO ODIOUS AS THE CONDITION OF SLAVES MUST BE TAKEN STRICTLY. <HI>(Tracing the &s;ubject to natural princi|ples, the claim of &s;lavery never can be &s;up|ported.)</HI>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">(&Dagger;) The&s;e additions in Italics between hooks before and after the words "THE POWER CLAIMED BY THIS RETURN WAS NEVER IN USE HERE," are taken from the notes of a very ingenious and able coun&s;ellor, who was pre&s;ent when the judgement was given.&mdash;The re&s;t of his notes &s;ufficiently agree in &s;ub&s;tance with what Mr. <HI>E&s;twick</HI> has printed.</NOTE> THE POWER CLAIMED BY THIS RETURN WAS NEVER IN USE HERE: (or <HI>acknowledged by the law.</HI>) No ma&s;ter ever was allowed here to take a &s;lave by force to be &s;old abroad becau&s;e he had de&s;erted from his &s;ervice, or for any other rea&s;on whatever; WE CANNOT SAY, <HI>the cau&s;e &s;et forth by this return</HI> IS ALLOW|ED

But the&s;e heavy charges of the want of "PRECISION," of "DELPHIC AMBIGUITY," and of being <Q>CONFOUNDED in GRAND UN|CERTAINTY,</Q> &amp;c. are &s;o far from being "CANDID REFLECTIONS," (as this author would have us believe them,) that even <HI>his own evidence</HI> on the proceeding page, clear|ly proves the fal&s;ehood and inju&s;tice of this cen&s;ures; for he has there given us the EFFECT of that late judgment of the court of King's Bench, in THE CLEAREST TERMS, without the lea&s;t <HI>doubt</HI> or <HI>difficulty;</HI> &s;o that the <HI>delphic ambiguity,</HI> of which he <HI>immediate|ly after</HI> complains, mu&s;t be (even accord|ing to his own evidence,) a mere <HI>calumny!</HI></P>
<P>After reciting the opinion of lord chief ju&s;tice <HI>Holt,</HI> he immediately adds as follows.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Lord chief ju&s;tice mansfield</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>adds to this effect.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>That the laws of <HI>Great Britain</HI> do not authorize a ma&s;ter to <HI>reclaim</HI> his fugi|tive SLAVE, <HI>confine</HI> or <HI>tran&s;port</HI> him out of the kingdom. In other words;</Q> (&s;ays

<P>Thus, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>un-candid re|flections</HI> of this author about DELPHIC AM|BIGUITY, yet even <HI>he him&s;elf</HI> has without <HI>doubt</HI> or <HI>difficulty,</HI> declared THE <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>unavoidable</HI> EFFECT of the judgement de|livered by Lord <HI>Mansfield!</HI> That this au|thor (notwith&s;tanding his prejudices, and unju&s;t cen&s;ures about ambiguity) has real|ly &s;tated the <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>unavoidable</HI> EFFECT of the &s;aid judgment, will appear by the following remarks upon it.</P>

<HEAD>Remarks on the Judgment of the Court of <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Bench,</HI> in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Stewart</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et.</HI> By <HI>Gran|ville Sharp.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS judgment will not appear doubt|ful and inexplicit, (as &s;ome have too ha&s;tily e&s;teemed it) if the whole be taken together, and THE EFFECT of it be duly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>LORD <HI>Mansfield</HI> pronounced the &s;enti|ments or judgment <HI>of the whole bench,</HI> and therefore if any thing was wrong, the blame ought not to re&s;t on him alone; ne|verthele&s;s, if we fairly examine what was &s;aid, we &s;hall find no room for blame or cavil, His lord&s;hip &s;aid, <Q>WE <HI>pay due attention</HI> to the opinion of Sir <HI>Philip York</HI> and Mr. <HI>Talbot,</HI> in the year 1729,</Q></P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="140">Now the purport of that opinion was, that the ma&s;ter <Q><HI>may legally compel</HI> his &s;lave <HI>to return to the plantations.</HI></Q></P>
<P>LORD <HI>Mansfield</HI> mode&s;tly declined giving a direct contradiction, in expre&s;s words, to the opinion of two &s;uch very eminent and learned lawyers; but cho&s;e rather to con|demn it, tacitly, by <HI>the effect</HI> of the judg|ment, which he was about to pronounce; and therefore he merely recited the opinion without the lea&s;t comment, and proceeded to the determination of the court upon the ca&s;e before them; which is clear and incon|trovertible with re&s;pect to the main point of the que&s;tion, viz. the power claimed by the ma&s;ter, of carrying away his &s;lave by force.</P>
<P><Q><HI>The power claimed by this return,</HI> (&s;aid the chief ju&s;tice) <HI>was never in u&s;e here, or ac|knowledged by the law.</HI></Q> Now it was cer|tainly the duty of the court to give judg|ment according to <HI>the known laws,</HI> and not to be influenced by <HI>any opinion</HI> what&s;oever.</P>
<P>THEY acknowledged, indeed, the having <HI>"paid due attention"</HI> to the &s;aid opinion; but as their determination was diametrically oppo&s;ite to the a&s;&s;ertions in that opinion, it is manife&s;t, that the court <HI>did not think it grounded in law,</HI> according to which alone they were bound to determine. The con|clu&s;ion of lord <HI>Mansfield</HI>'s &s;peech contains
<PB N="74" REF="141">more &s;ub&s;tantial and unan&s;werable rea&s;ons for the judgment he was about to give, than the generality of his hearers, perhaps, were aware of; for he very ingeniou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;mall compa&s;s of two &s;hort &s;entences, that the ma&s;ters claim was contrary to three principal foundations of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> law, viz. NATURE, USE, (or <HI>Cu&s;tom,</HI>) and the WRITTEN LAW; which la&s;t al&s;o includes two other foundations, viz. MAXIMS and STATUTES. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, he &s;aid &mdash;<Q><HI>traceing the &s;ubject to</HI> NATURAL <HI>princi|ples, the claim of</HI> SLAVERY <HI>never can be &s;upported.</HI></Q> With re&s;pect to the &s;econd, he &s;aid,&mdash;<Q><HI>The power claimed by this return, was never in</HI> USE <HI>here,</HI></Q> and thirdly, that it was "never <HI>acknowledged by</HI> THE LAW."</P>

<P><PB N="75" REF="142">THAT there is nothing <HI>doubtful</HI> or <HI>inexplicit</HI> in this <HI>judgement,</HI> delivered by lord <HI>Mansfield,</HI> will further appear by the following report of a ca&s;e in the PREROGATIVE COURT, wherein this very determination on <HI>Somer&s;et</HI>'s ca&s;e, is expre&s;sly cited, and the EFFECT of it clearly and fully declared by a learned judge of that court. And the propriety of the &s;aid judgment has very lately been &s;till fur|ther confirmed by a decree al&s;o in THE HIGH COURT OF ADMIRALTY, after a very learn|ed and &s;olemn debate concerning the <HI>legality,</HI> or, <HI>illegality of &s;lavery in England,</HI> wherein the merits of the que&s;tion on both &s;ides was fully examined and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.

<PB N="76" REF="143">to remark, that the negroe did not '<HI>apply for redre&s;s of the&s;e injuries,</HI>' till more than two years after they were committed, whereby he was deprived of the <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> to which THE HABEAS CORPUS ACT would otherwi&s;e have entitled him <Q>IN ANY OF HIS MAJESTY'S COURTS OF RECORD,</Q> viz.&mdash;<Q><HI>to recover his treble co&s;ts, be&s;ides damages, which damages &s;o to be given,</HI> (lays the act) <HI>&s;hall not be le&s;s than</HI> FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS,</Q> that is <HI>five hundred pounds</HI> from <HI>each</HI> offen|dor,&mdash;frm <HI>every individual</HI> concerned (and the&s;e &s;eem, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to have been more than 4 or 5) that had either been '<HI>ad|vi&s;ing aiding,</HI> or '<HI>a&s;&s;i&s;ting,</HI>' in &s;o flagrant a breach of the peace; and they would like|wi&s;e have been &s;ubject to all the '<HI>pains, pe|nalties, forfeitures, lo&s;&s;es</HI> or <HI>di&s;&s;abilities</HI> ordained in THE STATUTE <HI>of</HI> PROVISION <HI>and</HI> PRAE|MUNIRE!

<P>UPON argument, it was &s;aid by the coun|cil on behalf of <HI>Crichton,</HI> that by a very late ca&s;e in the King's Bench, of <HI>Knowles
<PB N="78" REF="145">
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>(a) Knowles</HI> was the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip who detain|ed <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> by order of Mr. <HI>Stewart,</HI> who claimed the latter as his <HI>property.</HI></NOTE> and Somer&s;et,</HI> negroes were declared <HI>to be free in England,</HI> and con&s;equently, they could not be the &s;ubjects of <HI>property,</HI> or be con|&s;idered as any part of a per&s;onal e&s;tate.</P>
<P>IT was an&s;wered, that the ca&s;e above|mentioned was determined only in 1772; that A. B. died in 1769, at which time negrees were in &s;ome re&s;pects, con&s;idered as property, and therefore that he ought to have been included in the account,</P>
<P>THE judge (Dr. <HI>Hay,</HI>) &s;aid that this court had no right to try any que&s;tion rela|ting to freedom and &s;lavery; but as <HI>Negroes</HI> had been <HI>declared free</HI> by the court which had the proper juri&s;diction, that determina|tion referred to them, as well at the pre|ceeding time, as at the pre&s;ent, and therefore directed, that article, in which the <HI>negroe</HI> was mentioned, to be &s;truck out of the <HI>ex|ceptive allegation.</HI></P>

<P><Q>GEORGE ROGERS alias RIGGES, a negro about nineteen years of age, had been a &s;ervant to &s;everal gentlemen in <HI>England,</HI> and in the &s;ummer of 1766,
<PB N="80" REF="147">being then out of place, became ac|quainted with <HI>John Latter</HI> and <HI>John Se&s;&s;ins,</HI> who contracted with <HI>Arthur Jones</HI> for the &s;ale of him; an a&s;&s;ignment was accordingly drawn for that purpo&s;e, and &s;igned by <HI>John Latter,</HI> by which <HI>Rogers</HI> was transferred to Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> and <HI>Jones,</HI> as a &s;lave, for the &s;um of twelve guineas.</Q></P>
<P><Q>SOME time in Augu&s;t, 1766, after the &s;ale above mentioned, <HI>Rogers,</HI> under &s;ome fal&s;e pretences, was carried on board the &s;hip <HI>Britannia,</HI> then lying at <HI>Deptford,</HI> of which Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> and <HI>Jones</HI> were owners, was there detained again&s;t his will, and that hemight not e&s;cape, was carried down into the &s;ail room, by order of the chief mate, and the gratings were put upon him. In this confinement he was kept, till the &s;hip &s;et &s;ail, when he was relea&s;ed, and &s;uffer|ed to go about upon deck; but not being entered in the &s;hip's books as a mariner, nor having any particular office, or wages a&s;&s;igned to him, he was &s;et to work about the &s;hip's duty in general till he was ap|pointed as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the cook, which office he executed &s;ometimes as a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and &s;ometimes as principal cook, during the whole voyage. The &s;hip fir&s;t &s;ailed to the coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> on the SLAVE TRADE,
<PB N="81" REF="148">and from thence to <HI>Porto Rico,</HI> where he was offered to &s;ale, by the captain of the <HI>Britannia,</HI> as a prime &s;lave; but <HI>Rogers</HI> having found an opportunity of relating his &s;tory to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> merchants, they refu&s;ed to purcha&s;e him; he therefore returned with the &s;hip, in which he &s;till acted in his former capacity of a&s;&s;i&s;tant cook; and upon their arrival in the port of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> in <HI>May</HI> 1768, when the other ma|riners were paid and di&s;charged, he was &s;till detained on board again&s;t his will.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HERE he continued for &s;ome time, till he contrived to give the officers the &s;lip, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice of &s;ome friends, went to <HI>Doctors Commons,</HI> and ap|plied to Mr. <HI>Faulckner,</HI> a proctor, to put him in a way of recovering his wages, or &s;ome other recompence for his labour. Mr. <HI>Faulckner</HI> accordingly wrote to <HI>Arthur Jones,</HI> one of the owners, for that purpo&s;e; and <HI>Rogers</HI> being ap|pointed likewi&s;e to meet <HI>Jones</HI> at the proctor's office, was waiting at a pub|lic hou&s;e, in <HI>Doctors Commons,</HI> till &s;ent for; when <HI>Jones, Seffins,</HI> and another man, came into the hou&s;e, forced <HI>Ro|gers</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="149">into a coach, conveyed him back, and forced him on board another &s;hip, where he was chained to the main|ma&s;t, till he was relea&s;ed by the deputy|mar&s;hal of the High Court of Admiralty, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. <HI>Shea,</HI> one of his old ma&s;ters, and &s;ome other friends, who had obtained a warrant to take him out of his confinement.</Q></P>
<P><Q>SEVERAL rea&s;ons prevented his ap|plying for redre&s;s of the&s;e injuries, till the beginning of the year 1774, when Mr. <HI>Torriano</HI> was employed to commence an action again&s;t <HI>Arthur Jones,</HI> as one of the owners, for the purpo&s;e of recovering the u&s;ual wages, or &s;ome other recompence in lieu there|of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AFTER the u&s;ual proceedings, the cau&s;e was brought for hearing on June, 29, 1776; when the facts being all clearly proved as above &s;tated, the prin|cipal que&s;tion was,&mdash;<HI>How far the plea of SLAVERY, &s;et up by the defendant, could be admitted in bar of the demand of wages?</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>IT was in&s;i&s;ted on by the coun&s;el on be|half of <HI>Rogers,</HI> that the kind of &s;lavery, here &s;poken of, never had any exi&s;tence under the laws of <HI>England;</HI> and in &s;upport of that, referred to the well known Ca&s;e
<PB N="83" REF="150">of <HI>Knowles</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> before lord <HI>Mansfield;</HI> and likewi&s;e to a late one in the PREROGATIVE COURT, of <HI>Cay</HI> and <HI>Crichton.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>THE coun&s;el for the defendant argu|ed, that, till the ca&s;e of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> the law of <HI>England</HI> admitted &s;lavery; and in &s;upport of this, they quoted the au|thority of Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hale;</HI> and, in particular, the opinions of the Lords <HI>Talbot</HI> and <HI>Hardwick.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Decree of the Court thereupon was, in &s;ub&s;tance, as follows.</P>
<P><Q><HI>THERE are two principal points in this cau&s;e;</HI> (&s;aid the Judge)</Q></P>
<P><Q>1&s;t. <HI>Whether &s;uch a &s;ervice is proved (as &s;tated in the &s;ummary Petition) as to enti|tle the plaintiff to the wages demanded? and</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>2dly. <HI>Whether the plea of &s;lavery &s;hall be a &s;ufficient bar to the claim?</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>With regard to the</HI> FIRST, <HI>it appears by the fulle&s;t evidence, that the plaintiff had &s;erv|ed on board the &s;hip, either in the capacity of a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the cook, or as cook him&s;elf, during the greate&s;t part of the voyage, and con&s;equently was entitled to &s;ome recompence for his &s;ervices; but not being entered as a mariner in the &s;hip's book, nor having any
<PB N="84" REF="151">&s;tipulated wages a&s;&s;igned him, it being proba|ble that the owners meant to &s;ell him again in the We&s;t Indies, he cannot be allowed any &s;pe|cific &s;um under the name of</HI> WAGES; <HI>but as be certainly performed the duty to which he was a&s;&s;igned, without any objection to his be|haviour in it, the maritime law clearly gives him a</HI> QUANTUM MERUIT. <HI>The cook's wages appear to have been</HI> &pound;1. 5<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. per Month, which is more than</HI> Rogers, <HI>ma&s;t probably, could fairly de&s;erve. But upon in|&s;pection of the mariners contract, it appears that there were &s;everal negroe boys in the &s;ame &s;hip, in the quality of apprentices, who were allowed from</HI> 10<HI>s. to</HI> 17<HI>s. and</HI> 6<HI>d. per month;</HI></Q> he &s;ignified his opinion therefore, <HI>that</HI> Rogers <HI>might fairly de&s;erve</HI> 15<HI>s. per month,</HI> which he accordingly decreed him, from the time of his being fir&s;t carried on board.</P>
<P><Q><HI>With regard to the</HI> SECOND <HI>point, it was urged</HI> (&s;aid the judge) <HI>that the plaintiff was a</HI> SLAVE, <HI>and con&s;equently was not entitled to any reward for his &s;ervice at all.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>The practice of buying and &s;elling &s;laves</HI> (the learned judge remarked) <HI>was cer|tainly very common in</HI> England, <HI>before the ca&s;e of</HI> SOMERSET, <HI>in the Court of King's Bench,</HI> 1772, <HI>but however it might have been the law of the Royal Ex|change,</HI></Q>
<PB N="85" REF="152">he hoped, <Q><HI>it never was the law of</HI> England.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>The</HI> OPINIONS <HI>of lord</HI> Hardwicke, <HI>and lord</HI> Talbot, <HI>when Attorney and Solicitor general, have been quoted in &s;upport of this practice, and have formerly given too much countenance to it, though they &s;eemed origi|nally to have been only applied to the diffe|rence created by bapti&s;m.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>But by a late determination of one of the able&s;t judges that ever pre&s;ided in this king|dom, the&s;e opinions have been held to be mi&s;|taken and un&s;ound; and there can be no fur|ther doubt, that the claim of</HI> SLAVERY <HI>is not maintainable by the laws of</HI> England.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>The law therefore was the &s;ame before the time of the above opinions, as &s;ince; and, con|&s;equently, refers to all &s;ales what&s;oever of this nature; which are every one illegal: and therefore the pretended &s;ale in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, in</HI> 1766, <HI>was an ab&s;olute nullity; and when the allegation, &s;tating the &s;ale, was admitted on behalf of the owners, had</HI> Rogers <HI>appeared, under prote&s;t, upon this point of law, it would have been received in bar of the plea!</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>The owners &s;eem to have acted upon a mi&s;taken notion of their right; but as the claim of &s;lavery is clearly again&s;t the law of this country, and as it appeared that</HI> Rogers
<PB N="86" REF="153"><HI>had always acted in &s;ome u&s;eful capacity dur|ing the whole time of his having been on board,</HI></Q> the judge &s;aid, he thought <Q><HI>him entitled to a</HI> QUANTUM MERUIT <HI>for his &s;ervice,</HI></Q>&mdash;which he accordingly fixed as above; and condemned the owners in co&s;ts; which were immediately taxed to the amount of &pound;81. 11<HI>s.</HI> 0<HI>d.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the great cau&s;e depending between Mr. <HI>Stuart,</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> the negro, is at pre&s;ent one of the principal topics of general conver&s;ation, by in&s;erting the fol|lowing you will afford a &s;ea&s;onable and ra|tional entertainment to your readers. I am your's, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Extract of a letter from a per&s;on in</HI> Mary|land, <HI>to his friend in</HI> Philadelphia.</P>
<P><Q>I am &s;o happy as to think as you do, with regard to trading in man, or keep|ing
<PB N="88" REF="155">him a &s;lave. The cu&s;tom is wicked and iniquitous, neither con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on, or the laws of God or man. Poor unhappy &s;laves, particularly tho&s;e forced from their places of nativity, are mo&s;t certainly deplorable objects of com|mi&s;eration. I never bought more than two during twenty years re&s;idence here. One proved to be the &s;on of an African Prince; he was a mo&s;t comely youth: hav|ing ob&s;erved his uncommon good parts, I &s;ent him to &s;chool, and u&s;ed him like a free man during his &s;tay with me. The directors of the African Company having enquired, and offered a reward for him, I by a public act pre&s;ented the poor crea|ture with his freedom, gave him an order for the reward afore&s;aid, and &s;ent him to London; from whence the following year he remitted me the &s;ame &s;um he co&s;t me, and &s;undry rich goods to the amount of three hundred pounds and upwards, and therewith a letter in his own native lan|guage, tran&s;lated by Dr. De&s;aguillier, of Cambridge.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The next I purcha&s;ed was an unhap|py lad, kidnapped from his free pa|rents at the taking of Guadaloupe. During his &s;tay with me he decayed or pined &s;o much, and expre&s;&s;ed &s;o &s;en&s;ible a &s;orrow of cruel &s;eparation from his
<PB N="89" REF="156">aged parents, relations, and countrymen, that actuated by the unerring good provi|dence which directs us in all our good deeds, I likewi&s;e &s;et this poor creature free, and &s;ent him to his native place. Providence again would not excu&s;e my being further rewarded, for performing this my duty as a Chri&s;tian. The truly hone&s;t father, from the produce of his plantations, has made me pre&s;ents to the amount of fifty pounds &s;terling, with direction to draw upon him for the full co&s;t of the poor youth, which I do never intend, being more than paid by pre&s;ents</Q></P>
<P><Q>I write this to convince you that the in|habitants of Africa are not &s;uch &s;en&s;ele&s;s bruti&s;h creatures as thoughtle&s;s authors repre&s;ent them to be: they undoubtedly are capable of receiving in&s;truction, and far out-do Chri&s;tians in many commend|able virtues. Poor creatures! their great|e&s;t unhappine&s;s is being acquainted with <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The worthy and benevolent writer mu&s;t mean &s;uch <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> only as tho&s;e, who carry out with them nothing of that mo&s;t amiable profe&s;&s;ion of religion but <HI>the name,</HI> to the '<HI>&s;hip-wrack,</HI>' of their own &s;ouls, and to the di&s;grace of their native country, if that al&s;o is called <HI>Chri&s;tian!</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="157"><Q>The following is a letter from the Negro Prince, &s;ome time after he arrived at <HI>London,</HI> to his ma&s;ter in <HI>Maryland.</HI> Tran&s;lated by Dr. <HI>De&s;aguillier,</HI> of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> 1743.</Q></P>
<P><HI>From the great city, 3d moon after my relea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><Q>O my kind merciful ma&s;ter, my good white brother, too good, a very good &s;on of a good woman, and of a very good old man, created good old people by the GREAT SPIRIT, who made my country, thy poor (I &s;hould &s;ay heretofore poor) mo&s;t grate|ful black pri&s;oner, now rendered rich by thy goodne&s;s and mercy, is now mo&s;t dead, mo&s;t drunk, mo&s;t mad with joy! Why is he &s;o? becau&s;e he is going to his good warm country, to his good old mo|ther, to his good old father, to his little &s;i&s;ter and his brother. In my good warm country all things are good, except the white people who live there, and come in flying hou&s;es to take away poor black pri&s;o|ners from their mothers, their fathers, their &s;i&s;ters and brothers, to kill them with hun|ger and filth, in the cellars of their flying|hou&s;es, wherein if they do not die fa&s;t
<PB N="91" REF="158">enough, and poor pri&s;oners talk for bread and water, and want to feel the wind, and to &s;ee THE GREAT SPIRIT, to com|plain to him, to tell him all, or to &s;ee the trees of his good warm country once more for the la&s;t time, the King of the white people [<HI>prabably the negro meant the captain</HI>] orders the officer called Jack, to kill many of the black pri&s;oners, with whips, with ropes, knives, axes and &s;alt. The governor of thy flying hou&s;e has been to &s;hew that which is to carry me and him to my good warm country; I am glad, very glad indeed! He goes there with wine. Should he be &s;ick, (and white people &s;eldom e&s;cape being &s;o there,) be|cau&s;e of thee my kind merciful ma&s;ter, and good white brother, and becau&s;e he has been good to me, and is a very good white man too, I will nur&s;e him my&s;elf, my mother, my father, my little &s;i&s;ter, and my brother, &s;hall be his brother, his mother, his father, and his &s;i&s;ter too; he &s;hall have one large heap of ele|phants teeth and gold, for thee my kind merciful ma&s;ter, and kind brother, and one for him&s;elf al&s;o (but &s;maller.) He at pre&s;ent is my father, I eat at his hou&s;e, and lie there too upon the bed thou pre|&s;ented me with. His woman is my mo|ther,
<PB N="92" REF="159">and kindly nur&s;es me, being very &s;ick of the &s;ea and fire made of black &s;tones. I have received a great quantity of gold, be&s;ides what thou did pre&s;ent me with by means of thy hand writing, to the people who are to &s;end me to my country, &s;ome part whereof I have given to the governor of thy &s;wimming-hou&s;e, to be &s;ent to thee; had I an hou&s;eful &s;hould &s;end the whole with equal plea|&s;ure; however, thou &s;halt &s;ee hereafter, that black people are not bea&s;ts, and do know how to be grateful. After thou my kind merciful ma&s;ter and good white bro|ther left me in thy &s;wiming-hou&s;e, we, thy white people, and we thy grateful black pri&s;oners, were by the GREAT SPIRIT, who was angry with us, &s;ent by the wind into an immen&s;e great river, where we had like to have been drowned, and where we could &s;ee neither &s;un nor moon, for &s;ix days and nights. I was dying during one whole moon, the governor was my father, and gave me tho&s;e good things thou pre&s;ented me with on my bed, he lodged me in the little room thy carpenter built for me. Thou gave me more cloaths than I could carry, yet I was very cold; nothing avail|ed with poor black pri&s;oner, till at la&s;t hav|ing THE GREAT SPIRIT to &s;end me &s;afe to thy hou&s;e on &s;hore, I thought I was carried
<PB N="93" REF="160">there, [<HI>this appears to have been a dream</HI>] where thou my good white brother did u&s;e me with wonted goodne&s;s, &s;pake to THE GREAT SPIRIT, and TO HIS SON, that I might keep &s;o during the voyage and af|terwards, which they have done for thy &s;ake; they will always do me good becau&s;e of thee my good white brother; therefore my kind merciful ma&s;ter, do not forget thy poor black pri&s;oner. When thou do&s;t &s;peak to THE GREAT SPIRIT and TO HIS SON, I do know he will hear thee, I &s;hall never be &s;ick more, for which I &s;hall be thank|ful. Pray &s;peak for my good old mother, my good father, my little &s;i&s;ter, and my brother; I wi&s;h they may be healthy, to many very many moons, as many as the hairs on thy head; I love them all much, yet I think not &s;o much as I do thee, I could die in my country for thee, could I do thee any kindne&s;s. Indeed THE GREAT SPIRIT well knows I mean no lie, &s;hall always &s;peak to him for thy good, believe me my good white brother, thy poor black pri&s;oner is not a liar.</Q></P>
