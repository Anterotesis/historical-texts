<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER having long ce|lebrated the &s;uperiour Graces and Excellencies, among Men, in an Ima|ginary Character, I do my &s;elf the
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
Honour to &s;how my Veneration for tran&s;cendent Merit under my own Name, in this Addre&s;s to your Lord|&s;hip. The ju&s;t Application of tho&s;e high Accompli&s;hments of which you are Ma&s;ter, has been an Ad|vantage to all your Fellow Subjects; and it is from the common Obli|gation you have laid upon all the World, that I, though a private Man, can pretend to be affected with, or take the Liberty to ac|knowledge your great Talents and publick Virtues.</P>
<P>It gives a plea&s;ing Pro&s;pect to your Friends, that is to &s;ay, to the Friends of your Country, that you have pa&s;&s;ed through the Highe&s;t Offices, at an Age when others u&s;ually do but form to them&s;elves the Hopes of them. They may expect to &s;ee you in the Hou&s;e of Lords as many Years as you were a&s;cending to it. It is our common
<PB N="v" REF="4">
Good, that your admirable Elo|quence can now no longer be employed but in the Expre&s;&s;ion of your own Sentiments and Judg|ment. The skilful Pleader is now for ever chang'd into the ju&s;t Judge; which latter Character your Lord|&s;hip exerts with &s;o prevailing an Impartiality, that you win the Ap|probation even of tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ent from you, and you always obtain Favour, becau&s;e you are never mo|ved by it.</P>
<P>This gives you a certain Dignity peculiar to your pre&s;ent Situation, and makes the Equity, even of a Lord High Chancellor, appear but a Degree towards the Mag|nanimity of a Peer of <HI>Great Bri|tain.</HI></P>
<P>Forgive me, My Lord, when I cannot conceal from you, that I &s;hall never hereafter behold you,
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
but I &s;hall behold you, as lately, defending the Brave, and the Un|fortunate.</P>
<P>When we attend to your Lord|&s;hip, engaged in a Di&s;cour&s;e, we cannot but reflect upon the many Requi&s;ites which the vain-glorious Speakers of Antiquity have deman|ded in a Man who is to excel in Oratory; I &s;ay, My Lord, when we reflect upon the Precepts by viewing the Example, though there is no Excellence propo&s;ed by tho&s;e Rhetoricians wanting, the whole Art &s;eems to be re&s;olved into that one Motive of Speaking, Sincerity in the Intention. The graceful Manner, the apt Ge&s;ture, and the a&s;&s;umed Concern, are impotent Helps to Per&s;ua&s;ion, in Compari|&s;on of the hone&s;t Countenance of him who utters what he really means. From hence it is, that all the Beauties which others at|tain
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
with Labour, are in your Lord|&s;hip but the natural Effects of the Heart that dictates.</P>
<P>It is this noble Simplicity which makes you &s;urpa&s;s Mankind in the Faculties, wherein Mankind are di|&s;tingui&s;hed from other Creatures, Rea&s;on and Speech.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Gifts were communi|cated to all Men in Proportion to the Truth and Ardour of their Hearts, I &s;hould &s;peak of you with the &s;ame Force as you expre&s;s your &s;elf on any other Subject. But I re&s;i&s;t my pre&s;ent Impul&s;e, as agreeable as it is to me; though indeed, had I any Preten&s;ions to a Fame of this Kind, I &s;hould, above all other Themes, attempt a Pane|gyrick upon My Lord <HI>Cowper:</HI> For the only &s;ure Way to a Reputation for Eloquence, in an Age where|in that perfect Orator lives, is to

<P>I Went on <HI>Friday</HI> la&s;t to the Opera, and was &s;urpri&s;ed to find a thin Hou&s;e at &s;o noble an Entertainment, till I heard that the Tumbler was not to make his Appearance that Night. For my own Part, I was fully &s;atisfied with the Sight of an Actor, who, by the Grace and Propriety of his Action and Ge&s;ture, does Honour to an hu|mane Figure, as much as the other vilifies and degrades it. Every one will ea&s;ily imagine I mean Signior <HI>Nicolini,</HI> who &s;ets off the Character he bears in an Opera by his Action, as much as he does the Words of it by his Voice. Every Limb, and every Finger, contributes to the Part
<PB N="2" REF="9">
he acts, in&s;omuch that a deaf Man might go a long with him in the Sen&s;e of it. There is &s;carce a beautiful Po&s;ture in an old Statue which he does not plant him&s;elf in, as the different Cir|cum&s;tances of the Story give Occa&s;ion for it. He performs the mo&s;t ordinary Action in a Manner &s;uitable to the Greatne&s;s of his Character, and &s;hows the Prince even in the giving of a Letter, or the di&s;patching of a Me&s;&s;age. Our be&s;t Actors are &s;omewhat at a Lo&s;s to &s;upport them&s;elves with proper Ge&s;ture, as they move from any con|&s;iderable Di&s;tance to the Front of the Stage; but I have &s;een the Per&s;on of whom I am now &s;peak|ing, eater alone at the remote&s;t Part of it, and advance from it with &s;uch Greatne&s;s of Air and Meen, as &s;eemed to fill the Stage, and at the &s;ame Time commanded the Attention of the Au|dience with the Maje&s;ty of his Appearance. But notwith&s;tanding the Dignity and Elegance of this Entertainment, I find for &s;ome Nights pa&s;t, that <HI>Punchinello</HI> has robbed this Gentleman of the greater Part of his Female Spectators. The Truth of it is, I find it &s;o very hard a Task to keep that Sex under any Manner of Government, that I have often re&s;olved to give them over intirely, and leave them to their own Inventions. I was in Hopes that I had brought them to &s;ome Or|der, and was employing my Thoughts on the Reformation of their Petticoats, when on a &s;ud|den I received Information from all Parts, that they run gadding after a Puppet-Show. I know very well, that what I here &s;ay, will be thought by &s;ome malicious Per&s;ons to flow from Envy to Mr. <HI>Powell;</HI> for which Rea&s;on, I &s;hall &s;et the late Di&s;pute between us in a true Light. Mr. <HI>Powell</HI> and I had &s;ome Difference about Four Months ago, which we managed by way of Letter, as learned Men ought to do; and I was very well contented to bear &s;uch Sarca&s;ms as he was plea&s;ed to throw upon me, and an&s;wered them with the
<PB N="3" REF="10">
&s;ame Freedom. In the mid&s;t of this our Mi&s;un|der&s;tanding and Corre&s;pondence, I happened to give the World an Account of the Order of <HI>E&s;quires;</HI> upon which, Mr. <HI>Powell</HI> was &s;o di&s;inge|nuous, as to make one of his Puppets (I wi&s;h I know which of them it was) declare by way of Prologue, That one <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff,</HI> a Pretended <HI>E&s;quire,</HI> had wrote a &s;currilous Piece to the Di&s;|honour of that Rank of Men; and then, with more Art than Hone&s;ty, concluded, that all the <HI>E&s;quires</HI> in the Pit were abu&s;ed by his Antago|ni&s;t as much as he was. This publick Accu&s;a|tion made all the <HI>E&s;quires</HI> of that County, and &s;everal of other Parts, my profe&s;&s;ed Enemies. I do not in the lea&s;t que&s;tion, but that he will pro|ceed in his Ho&s;tilities; and I am informed, That Part of his De&s;ign in coming up to Town, was to carry the War into my own Quarters. I do therefore &s;olemnly declare, (notwith&s;tanding that I am a great Lover of Art and Ingenuity) that if I hear he opens any of his People's Mouths a|gain&s;t me, I &s;hall not fail to write a Critick up|on his whole Performance; for I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I have naturally &s;o &s;trong a De&s;ire of Prai&s;e, that I cannot bear Reproach, tho' from a Piece of Timber. As for <HI>Punch</HI> who takes all Opportu|nities of be&s;pattering me, I know very well his Original, and have been a&s;&s;ured by the Joyner who put him together, that he was in long Di&s;|pute with him&s;elf, whether he &s;hould turn him into &s;everal Pegs and Uten&s;ils, or make him the Man he is. The &s;ame Per&s;on confe&s;&s;ed to me, that he had once actually laid a&s;ide his Head for a Nut-cracker. As for his Scolding Wife, (how|ever &s;he may value her &s;elf at pre&s;ent) it is very well known, that &s;he is but a Piece of Crabtree. This Artificer further whi&s;pered in my Ear, that all his Courtiers and Nobles were taken out of a Quick&s;et-Hedge not far from <HI>I&s;lington;</HI> and that Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> him&s;elf, who is now &s;o great a Con|jurer,
<PB N="4" REF="11">
is &s;uppo&s;ed to have learned his whole Art from an old Woman in that Neighbourhood, whom he long &s;erved in the Figure of a Broom|&s;taff.</P>
<P>But perhaps it may look trivial to in&s;i&s;t &s;o much upon Men's Per&s;ons; I &s;hall therefore turn my Thoughts rather to examine their Behaviour, and con&s;ider, whether the &s;everal Parts are writ|ten up to that Character which Mr. <HI>Powell</HI> piques him&s;elf upon, of an able and judicious Drama|ti&s;t. I have for this Purpo&s;e provided my &s;elf with the Works of above Twenty <HI>French</HI> Criticks, and &s;hall examine, (by the Rules which they have laid down upon the Art of the Stage) whe|ther the Unity of Time, Place and Action, be rightly ob&s;erved in any one of this celebrated Author's Productions; as al&s;o, whether in the Parts of his &s;everal Actors, and that of <HI>Punch</HI> in Particular, there is not &s;ometimes an Impropriety of Sentiments, and an Impurity of Diction.</P>

<P>I came in here to Day at an Hour when only the Dead appear in Places of Re&s;ort and Gallan|try, and &s;aw hung up the E&s;cutcheon of Sir <HI>Han|nibal,</HI> a Gentleman who u&s;ed to frequent this Place, and was taken up and interred by the Company of Upholders, as having been &s;een here at an unlicen&s;ed Hour. The Coat of the Decea&s;ed is, Three Bowls and a Jack in a green Field; the Cre&s;t, a Dice-Box, with the King of Clubs and Pam for Supporters. Some Days ago the Body was carried out of Town with great Pomp and Ceremony, in order to be buried with his Ance&s;tors at the <HI>Peak.</HI> It is a Maxim in Mo|rality, That we are to &s;peak nothing but Truth of the Living, nothing but Good of the Dead. As I have carefully ob&s;erved the fir&s;t during his Life-time, I &s;hall acquit my &s;elf as to the latter now he is decea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="12">
He was Knighted very young, not in the ordi|nary Form, but by the common Con&s;ent of Man|kind.</P>
<P>He was in his Per&s;on between round and &s;quare; in the Motion and Ge&s;ture of his Body he was unaffected and free, as not having too great a Re&s;pect for Superiors. He was in his Di&s;cour&s;e bold and intrepid; and as every one has an Excellence as well as a Failing which di|&s;tingui&s;hes him from other Men, Eloquence was his predominant Quality, which he had to &s;o great a Perfection, that it was ea&s;ier to him to &s;peak than to hold his Tongue. This &s;ometimes expo&s;ed him to the Deri&s;ion of Men who had much le&s;s Parts than him&s;elf: And indeed his great Volubility and inimitable Manner of Speak|ing, as well as the great Courage he &s;hewed on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, did &s;ometimes betray him into that Figure of Speech which is commonly di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd by the Name of Ga&s;conade. To men|tion no other, he profe&s;&s;ed in this very Place &s;ome few Days before he died, That he would be One of the Six that would undertake to a&s;|&s;ault me; for which Rea&s;on I have had his Figure upon my Wall till the Hour of his Death: And am re&s;olved for the future to bury every one forthwith who I hear has an Intention to kill me.</P>
<P>Since I am upon the Subject of my Adver&s;aries, I &s;hall here publi&s;h a &s;hort Letter which I have received from a Well-wi&s;her, and is as follows:</P>

<P>It happened one Day, as a &s;tout and hone&s;t Ma&s;tiff (that guarded the Village where he lived again&s;t Thieves and Robbers) was very gravely walking, with one of his Puppies by his Side, all the little Dogs in the Street gather'd about him, and barked at him.

<P>THE Court being prepared for proceeding on the Cau&s;e of the Petticoat, I gave Orders to bring in a Criminal who was taken up as &s;he went out of the Puppet-Show about Three Nights ago, and was now &s;tanding in the Street with a great Concour&s;e of People about her. Word was brought me, that &s;he had endeavoured twice or thrice to come in, but could not do it by rea&s;on of her Petticoat, which was too large for the Entrance of my Hou&s;e, tho' I had ordered both the Folding-Doors to be thrown open for its Re|ception. Upon this, I de&s;ired the Jury of Ma|trons, who &s;tood at my Right Hand, to inform them&s;elves of her Condition, and know whether
<PB N="7" REF="14">
there were any private Rea&s;ons why &s;he might not make her Appearance &s;eparate from her Pet|ticoat. This was managed with great Di&s;cretion, and had &s;uch an Effect, that upon the Return of the Verdict from the Bench of Matrons, I i&s;&s;ued out an Order forthwith; That the Criminal &s;hould be &s;tripped of her Incumbrances; till &s;he became little enough to enter my Hou&s;e. I had before given Directions for an Engine of &s;everal Legs, that could contract or open it &s;elf like the Top of an Umbrello, in order to place the Pet|ticoat upon it, by which Means I might take a lei&s;urely Survey of it, as it &s;hould appear in its proper Dimen&s;ions. This was all done accord|ingly; and forthwith, upon the clo&s;ing of the Engine, the Petticoat was brought into Court. I then directed the Machine to be &s;et upon the Table, and dilated in &s;uch a Manner as to &s;how the Garment in its utmo&s;t Circumference; but my great Hall was too narrow for the Experi|ment; for before it was half unfolded, it de&s;cri|bed &s;o immoderate a Circle, that the lower Part of it bru&s;h'd upon my Face as I &s;ate in my Chair of Judicature. I then enquired for the Per&s;on that belonged to the Petticoat; and to my great Surprize, was directed to a very beautiful young Dam&s;el, with &s;o pretty a Face and Shape, that I bid her come out of the Crowd, and &s;eated her upon a little Crock at my Left Hand. My pret|ty Maid, &s;aid I, do you own your &s;elf to have been the Inhabitant of the Garment before us? The Girl I found had good Sen&s;e, and told me with a Smile, That notwith&s;tanding it was her own Petticoat, &s;he &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee an Example made of it; and that &s;he wore it for no other Rea&s;on, but that &s;he had a Mind to look as big and burly as other Per&s;ons of her Quality; That &s;he had kept out of it as long as &s;he could, and till &s;he began to appear little in the Eyes of all her Acquaintance; That if &s;he
<PB N="8" REF="15">
laid it a&s;ide, People would think &s;he was not made like other Women. I always give great Allowances to the Fair Sex upon Account of the Fa&s;hion, and therefore was not di&s;plea&s;ed with the Defence of my pretty Criminal. I then or|dered the Ve&s;t which &s;tood before us to be drawn up by a Pully to the Top of my great Hall, and afterwards to be &s;pread open by the Engine it was placed upon, in &s;uch a Manner, that it formed a very &s;plendid and ample Canopy over our Heads, and covered the whole Court of Ju|dicature with a kind of Silken Rotunda, in its Form not unlike the Cupolo of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s. I enter'd upon the whole Cau&s;e with great Satis|faction as I &s;ate under the Shadow of it.</P>
<P>The Council for the Petticoat was now called in, and ordered to produce what they had to &s;ay again&s;t the popular Cry which was rai&s;ed again&s;t it. They an&s;wered the Objections with great Strength and Solidity of Argument, and expatiated in very florid Harangues, which they did not fail to &s;et off and furbelow (if I may be allowed the Metaphor) with many Periodical Sentences and Turns of Oratory. The chief Arguments for their Client were taken, fir&s;t, from the great Be|nefit that might ari&s;e to our Woollen Manufactu|ry from this Invention, which was calculated as follows: The common Petticoat has not above Four Yards in the Circumference; whereas this over our Heads had more in the Semi-diameter; &s;o that by allowing it Twenty four Yards in the Circumference, the Five Millions of Woollen Petticoats, which (according to Sir <HI>William Pet|ty</HI>) &s;uppo&s;ing what ought to be &s;uppo&s;ed in a well|governed State, that all Petticoats are made of that Stuff, would amount to Thirty Millions of tho&s;e of the ancient Mode. A prodigious Im|provement of the Woollen Trade! and what could not fail to fink the Power of <HI>France</HI> in a few Years.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="16">
To introduce the Second Argument, they beg|ged Leave to read a Petition of the Rope-Makers, wherein it was repre&s;ented, That the Demand for Cords, and the Price of them, were much ri&s;en &s;ince this Fa&s;hion came up. At this, all the Company who were pre&s;ent lifted up their Eyes into the Vault; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, we did di&s;co|ver many Traces of Cordage which were inter|woven in the Stiffening of the Drapery.</P>
<P>A Third Argument was founded upon a Peti|tion of the <HI>Greenland</HI> Trade, which likewi&s;e re|pre&s;ented the great Con&s;umption of Whale-bone which would be occa&s;ioned by the pre&s;ent Fa&s;hion, and the Benefit which would thereby accrue to that Branch of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>To conclude, they gently touched upon the Weight and Unweildine&s;s of the Garment, which they in&s;inuated might be of great U&s;e to pre&s;erve the Honour of Families.</P>
<P>The&s;e Arguments would have wrought very much upon me, (as I then told the Company in a long and elaborate Di&s;cour&s;e) had I not con&s;ide|red the great and additional Expence which &s;uch Fa&s;hions would bring upon Fathers and Husbands; and therefore by no Means to be thought of till &s;ome Years after a Peace. I further urged, that it would be a Prejudice to the Ladies them&s;elves, who could never expect to have any Money in the Pocket, if they laid out &s;o much on the Petticoat. To this I added, the great Temptation it might give to Virgins, of acting in Security like mar|ried Women, and by that Means give a Check to Matrimony, an In&s;titution always encouraged by wi&s;e Societies.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time, in An&s;wer to the &s;everal Petitions produced on that Side, I &s;hewed one &s;ub&s;cribed by the Women of &s;everal Per&s;ons of Quality, humbly &s;etting forth, That &s;ince the In|troduction of this Mode, their re&s;pective Ladies had (in&s;tead of be&s;towing on them their Ca&s;t-Gowns)
<PB N="10" REF="17">
cut them into Shreds, and mixed them with the Cordage and Buckram, to compleat the Stiffening of their Under-Petticoats. For which and &s;undry other Rea&s;ons, I pronounced the Pet|ticoat a Forfeiture: But to &s;hew that I did not make that Judgment for the Sake of filthy Lucre, I ordered it to be folded up, and &s;ent it as a Pre|&s;ent to a Widow-Gentlewoman, who has five Daughters, de&s;iring &s;he would make each of them a Petticoat out of it, and &s;end me back the Remainder, which I de&s;ign to cut into Stoma|chers, Caps, Facings of my Wa&s;tcoat-Sleeves, and other Garnitures &s;uitable to my Age and Quality.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood, that (while I di&s;card this mon&s;trous Invention) I am an Enemy to the proper Ornaments of the Fair Sex. On the con|trary, as the Hand of Nature has poured on them &s;uch a Profu&s;ion of Charms and Graces, and &s;ent them into the World more amiable and fini&s;hed than the re&s;t of her Works; &s;o I would have them be&s;tow upon them&s;elves all the additional Beauties that Art can &s;upply them with, provided it does not interfere with, di&s;gui&s;e, or pervert, tho&s;e of Nature.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider Woman as a beautiful Romantick Animal, that may be adorned with Furs and Fea|thers, Pearls and Diamonds, Ores and Silks. The Lynx &s;hall ca&s;t its Skin at her Feet to make her a Tippet; the Peacock, Parrat and Swan, &s;hall pay Contributions to her Muff; the Sea &s;hall be &s;earched for Shells, and the Rocks for Gems; and every Part of Nature furni&s;h out its Share towards the Embelli&s;hment of a Creature that is the mo&s;t con&s;ummate Work of it. All this I &s;hall indulge them in; but as for the Petti|coat I have been &s;peaking of, I neither can, nor will allow it.</P>

My own Circum&s;tances are indeed &s;o narrow and &s;canty, that I &s;hould ta&s;t but very little Plea|&s;ure, could I receive it only from tho&s;e Enjoy|ments which are in my own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but by this great Tincture of Humanity, which I find in all my Thoughts and Reflections, I am happier than any &s;ingle Per&s;on can be, with all the Wealth, Strength, Beauty, and Succe&s;s, that can be conferred upon a Mortal, if he only reli&s;hes &s;uch a Proportion of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings as is ve&s;ted in him&s;elf, and is his own private Property. By this Means, every Man that does him&s;elf any real Service, does me a Kindne&s;s. I come in for my Share in all the Good that happens to a Man of Merit and Virtue, and partake of many Gifts of Fortune and Power that I was never born to. There is nothing in particular in which I &s;o much rejoice, as the Deliverance of good and ge|nerous Spirits out of Dangers, Difficulties, and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es. And becau&s;e the World does not &s;up|ply In&s;tances of this Kind to furni&s;h out &s;ufficient Entertainments for &s;uch an Humanity and Bene|volence of Temper, I have ever delighted in
<PB N="12" REF="19">
reading the Hi&s;tory of Ages pa&s;t, which draws together into a narrow Compa&s;s the great Oc|currences and Events that are but thinly &s;own in tho&s;e Tracts of Time which lie within our own-Knowledge and Ob&s;ervation. When I &s;ee the Life of a great Man, who has de&s;erved well of his Country, after having &s;truggled through all the Oppo&s;itions of Prejudice and Envy, break|ing out with Lu&s;tre, and &s;hining forth in all the Splendor of Succe&s;s, I clo&s;e my Book, and am an happy Man for a whole Evening.</P>
<P>But &s;ince in Hi&s;tory, Events are of a mixed Nature, and often happen alike to the Worthle&s;s and the De&s;erving, in&s;omuch that we frequently &s;ee a virtuous Man dying in the Mid&s;t of Di&s;ap|pointments and Calamities, and the Vicious end|ing their Days in Pro&s;perity and Peace; I love to amu&s;e my &s;elf with the Accounts I meet with in fabulous Hi&s;tories and Factions: For in this Kind of Writings we have always the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing Vice puni&s;hed, and Virtue rewarded. In|deed, were we able to view a Man in the whole Circle of his Exi&s;tence, we &s;hould have the Sa|tisfaction of &s;eeing it clo&s;e with Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery, according to its proper Merit: But tho' our View of him is interrupted by Death before the fini&s;hing of his Adventures, (if I may &s;o &s;peak) we may be &s;ure that the Conclu&s;ion and Cata&s;trophe is altogether &s;uitable to his Beha|viour. On the contrary, the whole Being of a Man, con&s;ider'd as an Hero, or a Knight-Er|rant, is comprehended within the Limits of a Poem or Romance, and therefore always ends to our Satisfaction; &s;o that Inventions of this Kind are like Food and Exerci&s;e to a good-natured Di&s;|po&s;ition, which they plea&s;e and gratifie at the &s;ame Time that they nouri&s;h and &s;trengthen. The greater the Affliction is in which we &s;ee our Favourites in the&s;e Relations engaged, the greater is the Plea&s;ure we take in &s;eeing them relieved.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="20">
Among the many feigned Hi&s;tories which I have met with in my Reading, there is none in which the Hero's Perplexity is greater, and the winding out of it more difficult, than that in a <HI>French</HI> Author who&s;e Name I have forgot. It &s;o happens, that the Hero's Mi&s;tre&s;s was the Si&s;ter of his mo&s;t intimate Friend, who for certain Rea&s;ons was given out to be dead, while he was preparing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o leave his Country in Que&s;t of Adventures. The Hero having heard of his Friend's Death, immediately repaired to his Mi|&s;tre&s;s, to condole with her, and comfort her. Upon his Arrival in her Garden, he di&s;cover'd at a Di&s;tance a Man cla&s;ped in her Arms, and em|braced with the mo&s;t endearing Tenderne&s;s. What &s;hould he do? It did not con&s;i&s;t with the Gentlene&s;s of a Knight-Errant either to kill his Mi&s;tre&s;s, or the Man whom &s;he was plea&s;ed to favour. At the &s;ame Time, it would have &s;poiled a Romance, &s;hould he have laid violent Hands on him&s;elf. In &s;hort, he immediately entered upon his Adventures; and after a long Series of Exploits, found out by Degrees, that the Per&s;on he &s;aw in his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Arms was her own Bro|ther, taking Leave of her before he left his Country, and the Embrace &s;he gave him nothing el&s;e but the affectionate Farewel of a Si&s;ter: So that he had at once the Two greate&s;t Sati&s;|factions that could enter into the Heart of Man, in finding his Friend alive, whom he thought dead; and his Mi&s;tre&s;s faithful, whom he had believed incon&s;tant.</P>
<P>There are indeed &s;ome Di&s;a&s;ters &s;o very fatal, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for any Accidents to rectifie them. Of this Kind was that of poor <HI>Lucretia;</HI> and yet we &s;ee <HI>Ovid</HI> has found an Expedient even in this Ca&s;e. He de&s;cribes a Beautiful and Royal Virgin walking on the Sea-&s;hore, where &s;he was di&s;covered by <HI>Neptune,</HI> and violated after a long and un&s;ucce&s;sful Importunity. To miti|gate
<PB N="14" REF="21">
her Sorrow, he offers her whatever &s;he would wi&s;h for. Never certainly was the Wit of Woman more puzzled in finding out a Strata|gem to retrieve her Honour. Had &s;he de&s;ired to be changed into a Stock or Stone, a Bea&s;t, Fi&s;h or Fowl, &s;he would have been a Lo&s;er by it: Or had &s;he de&s;ired to have been made a Sea-Nymph, or a Godde&s;s, her Immortality would but have perpetuated her Di&s;grace. Give me therefore, &s;aid &s;he, &s;uch a Shape as may make me incapable of &s;uffering again the like Calamity, or of being reproached for what I have already &s;uffered. To be &s;hort, &s;he was turned into a Man, and by that only Means avoided the Danger and Imputation &s;he &s;o much dreaded.</P>
<P>I was once my &s;elf in Agonies of Grief that are unutterable, and in &s;o great a Di&s;traction of Mind, that I thought my &s;elf even out of the Po&s;&s;ibility of receiving Comfort. The Occa&s;ion was as fol|lows: When I was a Youth in a Part of the Army which was then quartered at <HI>Dover,</HI> I fell in Love with an agreeable young Woman, of a good Fa|mily in tho&s;e Parts, and had the Satisfaction of &s;eeing my Addre&s;&s;es kindly received, which occa|&s;ioned the Perplexity I am going to relate.</P>
<P>We were in a calm Evening diverting our &s;elves upon the Top of the Cliff with the Pro&s;pect of the Sea, and trifling away the Time in &s;uch little Fond|ne&s;&s;es as are mo&s;t ridiculous to People in Bu&s;ine&s;s, and mo&s;t agreeable to tho&s;e in Love.</P>
<P>In the Mid&s;t of the&s;e our innocent Endearments, &s;he &s;natched a Paper of Ver&s;es out of my Hand, and ran away with them. I was following her, when on a &s;udden the Ground, tho' at a con&s;ide|rable Di&s;tance from the Verge of the Precipice, &s;unk under her, and threw her down from &s;o pro|digious an Height upon &s;uch a Range of Rocks, as would have da&s;hed her into Ten Thou&s;and Pieces, had her Body been made of Adamant. It is much ea&s;ier for my Reader to imagine my State of Mind
<PB N="15" REF="22">
upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, than for me to expre&s;s it. I &s;aid to my &s;elf, It is not in the Power of Hea|ven to relieve me! When I awaked, equally tran&s;|ported and a&s;toni&s;hed, to &s;ee my &s;elf drawn out of an Affliction which the very Moment before appeared to me altogether inextricable.</P>
<P>The Impre&s;&s;ions of Grief and Horrour were &s;o lively on this Occa&s;ion, that while they la&s;ted, they made me more mi&s;erable than I was at the real Death of this beloved Per&s;on, (which happened a few Months after, at a Time when the Match be|tween us was concluded) ina&s;much as the imagi|nary Death was untimely, and I my &s;elf in a Sort an Acce&s;&s;ary; whereas her real Decea&s;e had at lea&s;t the&s;e Alleviations, of being natural and in|evitable.</P>
<P>The Memory of the Dream I have related &s;till dwells &s;o &s;trongly upon me, that I can never read the De&s;cription of <HI>Dover-Cliff</HI> in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Tragedy of <HI>King Lear,</HI> without a fre&s;h Sen&s;e of my E&s;cape. The Pro&s;pect from that Place is drawn with &s;uch proper Incidents, that whoever can read it without growing giddy, mu&s;t have a good Head, or a very bad One.</P>
<Q><L>Come on, Sir, here's the Place; &s;tand &s;till! How fearful</L>
<L>And dizzy 'tis to ca&s;t ones Eyes &s;o low?</L>
<L>The Crows and Choughs that wing the Midway Air,</L>
<L>Show &s;carce as gro&s;s as Beetles. Half-Way down</L>
<L>Hangs one that gathers Samphire. Dreadful Trade!</L>
<L>Methinks he &s;eems no bigger than his Head.</L>
<L>The Fi&s;hermen that walk upon the Beach,</L>
<L>Appear like Mice, and yond' tall anchoring Bark</L>
<L>Dimini&s;h'd to'her Boat; her Boat! a Buoy</L>

<P>I Thought to have given over my Pro&s;ecution of the Dead for this Sea&s;on, having by me many other Projects for the Reformation of Man|kind; but I have receiv'd &s;o many Complaints from &s;uch different Hands, that I &s;hall di&s;oblige Multitudes of my Corre&s;pondents, if I do not take Notice of them. Some of the Decea&s;ed, who I thought had been laid quietly in their Graves, are &s;uch Hobgoblins in publick A&s;&s;em|blies, that I mu&s;t be forc'd to deal with them as <HI>Evander</HI> did with his triple-lived Adver&s;ary, who, according to <HI>Virgil,</HI> was forced to kill him thrice over before he could di&s;patch him.</P>

<P>I am likewi&s;e informed, That &s;everal Wives of my Dead Men have, &s;ince the Decea&s;e of their Husbands, been &s;een in many publick Places without Mourning, or Regard to common De|cency.</P>

<P>I Have peru&s;ed your <HI>Tatler</HI> of this Day, and have wept over it with great Plea&s;ure: I wi&s;h you would be more frequent in your Fa|mily-Pieces. For as I con&s;ider you under the Notion of a great De&s;igner, I think the&s;e are not your lea&s;t valuable Performances. I am glad to find you have given over your Face|painting for &s;ome Time, becau&s;e, I think, you have employed your &s;elf more in Grote&s;que Fi|gures than in Beauties; for which Rea&s;on, I would rather &s;ee you work upon Hi&s;tory-Pieces, that on &s;ingle Portraicts. Your &s;everal Draughts of Dead Men appear to me as Pictures of Still-Life, and have done great Good in the Place where I live. The 'Squire of a neighbouring Village, who had been a long Time in the Number of Non-Entities, is entirely recovered by them. For the&s;e &s;everal Years pa&s;t, there was not an Hare in the County that could be at Re&s;t for him; and I think, the greate&s;t Ex|ploit he ever boa&s;ted of, was, That when he was High-Sheriff of the County, he hunted a Fox &s;o far, that he could not follow him any further by the Laws of the Land. All the Hours he &s;pent at Home, were in &s;welling him|&s;elf with <HI>October,</HI> and rehear&s;ing the Wonders he did in the Field. Upon reading your Papers,

<P>I Have lately applied my &s;elf with much Sa|tisfaction to the curious Di&s;coveries that have been made by the Help of Micro&s;copes, as they are related by Authors of our own and other Na|tions. There is a great deal of Plea&s;ure in pry|ing into this World of Wonders, which Nature has laid out of Sight, and &s;eems indu&s;trious to conceal from us. Philo&s;ophy had ranged over all the vi&s;ible Creation, and began to want Objects for her Enquiries, when the pre&s;ent Age, by the Invention of Gla&s;&s;es, opened a new and inex|hau&s;tible Magazine of Rarities, more wonderful and amazing than any of tho&s;e which a&s;toni&s;hed our Forefathers. I was Ye&s;terday amu&s;ing my &s;elf with Speculations of this Kind, and re|flecting upon Myriads of Animals that &s;wim in
<PB N="22" REF="29">
tho&s;e little Seas of Juice that are contained in the &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els of an Humane Body. While my Mind was thus filled with that &s;ecret Wonder and Delight, I could not but look upon my &s;elf as in an Act of Devotion, and am very well plea&s;ed with the Thought of the great Heathen Anato|mi&s;t, who calls his De&s;cription of the Parts of an Humane Body, <HI>An Hymn to the Supreme Be|ing.</HI> The Reading of the Day produced in my Imagination an agreeable Morning's Dream, if I may call it &s;uch; for I am &s;till in Doubt, whe|ther it pa&s;&s;ed in my &s;leeping or waking Thoughts. However it was, I fancied that my good Genius &s;tood at my Bed's Head, and entertained me with the following Di&s;cour&s;e; for upon my Ri&s;ing, it dwelt &s;o &s;trongly upon me, that I writ down the Sub&s;tance of it, if not the very Words.</P>
<P>If (&s;aid he) you can be &s;o tran&s;ported with tho&s;e Productions of Nature which are di&s;co|vered to you by tho&s;e artificial Eyes that are the Works of Humane Invention, how great will your Surprize be, when you &s;hall have it in your Power to model your own Eye as you plea&s;e, and adapt it to the Bulk of Objects, which, with all the&s;e Helps, are by infinite Degrees too minute for your Perception. We who are unbodied Spi|rits can &s;harpen our Sight to what Degree we think fit, and make the lea&s;t Work of the Crea|tion di&s;tinct and vi&s;ible. This gives us &s;uch Idea's as cannot po&s;&s;ibly enter into your pre&s;ent Con|ceptions. There is not the lea&s;t Particle of Mat|ter which may not furni&s;h one of us &s;ufficient Employment for a whole Eternity. We can &s;till divide it, and &s;till open it, and &s;till di&s;cover new Wonders of Providence, as we look into the dif|ferent Texture of its Parts, and meet with Beds of vegetables, Mineral and Metallick Mixtures, and &s;everal Kinds of Animals that lie hid, and as it were lo&s;t in &s;uch an endle&s;s Fund of Mat|ter. I find you are &s;urprized at this Di&s;cour&s;e;
<PB N="23" REF="30">
but as your Rea&s;on tells you there are infinite Parts in the &s;malle&s;t Portion of Matter, it will likewi&s;e convince you, that there is as great a Variety of Secrets, and as much Room for Di&s;|coveries, in a Particle no bigger than the Point of a Pin, as in the Globe of the whole Earth. Your Micro&s;copes bring to Sight Shoals of living Creatures in a Spoonful of Vinegar; but we who can di&s;tingui&s;h them in their different Magni|tudes, &s;ee among them &s;everal huge <HI>Leviathans</HI> that terrify the little Fry of Animals about them, and take their Pa&s;time as in an Ocean, or the great Deep. I could not but &s;mile at this Part of his Relation, and told him, I doubted not but he could give me the Hi&s;tory of &s;everal Invi&s;ible Giants, accompanied with their re&s;pective Dwarfs, in ca&s;e that any of the&s;e little Beings are of an humane Shape. You may a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf (&s;aid he) that we &s;ee in the&s;e little Animals different Natures, In&s;tincts and Modes of Life, which cor|re&s;pond to what you ob&s;erve in Creatures of bigger Dimen&s;ions. We de&s;cry Millions of Spe|cies &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on a green Leaf, which your Gla&s;|&s;es repre&s;ent only in Crowds and Swarms. What appears to your Eye but as Hair or Down ri&s;ing on the Surface of it, we find to be Woods and Forre&s;ts, inhabited by Bea&s;ts of Prey, that are as dreadful in tho&s;e their little Haunts, as Lyons and Tygers in the De&s;erts of <HI>Libya.</HI> I was much de|lighted with his Di&s;cour&s;e, and could not forbear telling him, That I &s;hould be wonderfully plea&s;ed to &s;ee a natural Hi&s;tory of Imperceptibles, con|taining a true Account of &s;uch Vegetables and Animals as grow and live out of Sight. Such Di&s;qui&s;itions (an&s;wered he) are very &s;uitable to rea&s;onable Creatures; and you may be &s;ure, there are many curious Spirits among&s;t us who employ them&s;elves in &s;uch Amu&s;ements. For as our Hands, and all our Sen&s;es, may be formed to what Degree of Strength and Delicacy we
<PB N="24" REF="31">
plea&s;e, in the &s;ame Manner as our Sight, we can make what Experiments we are inclin'd to, how &s;mall &s;oever the Matter be in which we make them. I have been pre&s;ent at the Di&s;&s;ection of a Mite, and have &s;een the Skeleton of a Flea. I have been &s;hown a Forre&s;t of numberle&s;s Trees, which has been pick'd out of an Acorn. Your Micro&s;cope can &s;how you in it a compleat Oak in Miniature; and could you &s;uit all your Organs as we do, you might pluck an Acorn from this lit|tle Oak, which contains another Tree; and &s;o proceed from Tree to Tree, as long as you would think fit to continue your Di&s;qui&s;itions. It is al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible (added he) to talk of Things &s;o remote from common Life, and the ordinary No|tions which Mankind receive from blunt and gro&s;s Organs of Sen&s;e, without appearing extra|vagant and ridiculous. You have often &s;een a Dog open'd, to ob&s;erve the Circulation of the Blood, or make any other u&s;eful Enquiry; and yet would be tempted to laugh if I &s;hould tell you, that a Circle of much greater Philo&s;ophers than any of the Royal Society, were pre&s;ent at the cutting up of one of tho&s;e little Animals which we find in the Blue of a Plumb: That it was ty'd down alive before them; and that they ob&s;erved the Palpitations of the Heart, the Cour&s;e of the Blood, the Working of the Mu&s;cles, and the Convul&s;ions in the &s;everal Limbs, with great Accuracy and Improvement. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;aid I, for my own Part, I go along with you in all your Di&s;coveries with great Plea&s;ure; but it is certain, they are too fine for the Gro&s;s of Mankind, who are more &s;truck with the De|&s;cription of every Thing that is great and bulky. Accordingly we find the be&s;t Judge of humane Nature &s;etting forth his Wi&s;dom, not in the For|mation of the&s;e minute Animals, (tho' indeed no le&s;s wonderful than the other) but in that of the <HI>Leviathan</HI> and <HI>Behemoth,</HI> the <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> and the
<PB N="25" REF="32">
<HI>Crocodile.</HI> Your Ob&s;ervation (&s;aid he) is very ju&s;t; and I mu&s;t acknowledge for my own Part, that although it is with much Delight that I &s;ee the Traces of Providence in the&s;e In&s;tances, I &s;till take greater Plea&s;ure in con&s;idering the Works of the Creation in their Immen&s;ity, than in their Mi|nutene&s;s. For this Rea&s;on, I rejoice when I &s;trengthen my Sight &s;o as to make it pierce into the mo&s;t remote Spaces, and take a View of tho&s;e Heavenly Bodies which lie out of the Reach of Humane Eyes, though a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Tele&s;copes. What you look upon as one confu&s;ed White in the Milky-Way, appears to me a long Tract of Heavens, di&s;tingui&s;h'd by Stars that are ranged in proper Figures and Con&s;tellations. While you are admiring the Sky in a Starry Night, I am en|tertained with a Variety of Worlds and Suns pla|ced one above another, and ri&s;ing up to &s;uch an immen&s;e Di&s;tance, that no created Eye can &s;ee an End of them.</P>
<P>The latter Part of his Di&s;cour&s;e flung me in|to &s;uch an A&s;toni&s;hment, that he had been &s;ilent for &s;ome Time before I took Notice of it; when on a &s;udden I &s;tarted up and drew my Curtains, to look if any one was near me, but &s;aw no Body, and cannot tell to this Moment whether it was my good Genius or a Dream that left me.</P>

<PB N="27" REF="34">
down &s;ome Time, I came into the Centre of it, which opened into a wide Plain, that was filled with Multitudes of both Sexes. I here di&s;covered Three great Roads, very wide and long, that led into Three different Parts of the Forre&s;t. On a &s;udden, the whole Multitude broke into Three Parts, according to their different Ages, and mar|ched in their re&s;pective Bodies into the Three great Roads that lay before them. As I had a Mind to know how each of the&s;e Roads termi|nated, and whether it would lead tho&s;e who pa&s;|&s;ed through them, I joined my &s;elf with the A&s;|&s;embly that were in the Flower and Vigour of their Age, and called them&s;elves, <HI>The Band of Lovers.</HI> I found to my great Surpri&s;e, that &s;eve|ral old Men be&s;ides my &s;elf had intruded into this agreeable Company; as I had before ob|&s;erved, there were &s;ome young Men who had united them&s;elves to the Band of Mi&s;ers, and were walking up the Path of Avarice; tho' both made a very ridiculous Figure, and were as much laughed at by tho&s;e they joined, as by tho&s;e they for&s;ook. The Walk which we marched up, for Thickne&s;s of Shades, Embroidery of Flowers, and Melody of Birds, with the di&s;tant Purling of Streams, and Falls of Water, was &s;o wonderfully delightful, that it charmed our Sen&s;es, and in|toxicated our Minds with Plea&s;ure. We had not been long here, before every Man &s;ingled out &s;ome Woman to whom he offered his Addre&s;&s;es, and profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a Lover; when on a &s;ud|den we perceived this delicious Walk to grow more narrow as we advanced in it, till it ended in many intricate Thickets, Mazes and Laby|rinths, that were &s;o mixed with Ro&s;es and Bram|bles, Brakes of Thorns, and Beds of Flowers, rocky Paths and plea&s;ing Grotto's, that it was hard to &s;ay, whether it gave greater Delight or Perplexity to tho&s;e who travelled in it.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="35">
It was here that the Lovers began to be eager in their Pur&s;uits. Some of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who only &s;eemed to retire for the Sake of Form and Decency, led them into Plantations that were di&s;|po&s;ed into regular Walks; where, after they had wheeled about in &s;ome Turns and Windings, they &s;uffered them&s;elves to be overtaken, and gave their Hands to tho&s;e who pur&s;ued them. O|thers withdrew from their Followers into little Wilderne&s;&s;es, where there were &s;o many Paths interwoven with each other in &s;o much Confu&s;ion and Irregularity, that &s;everal of the Lovers quit|ted the Pur&s;uit, or broke their Hearts in the Chace. It was &s;ometimes very odd to &s;ee a Man pur&s;uing a fine Woman that was following ano|ther, who&s;e Eye was fixed upon a Fourth, that had her own Game in View in &s;ome other Quar|ter of the Wilderne&s;s. I could not but ob&s;erve Two Things in this Place which I thought very particular, That &s;everal Per&s;ons who &s;tood only at the End of the Avenues, and ca&s;t a carele&s;s Eye upon the Nymphs during their whole Flight, often catched them, when tho&s;e who pre&s;&s;ed them the mo&s;t warmly through all their Turns and Doubles, were wholly un&s;ucce&s;sful: And that &s;ome of my own Age, who were at fir&s;t look'd upon with Aver&s;ion and Contempt, by being well acquainted with the Wilderne&s;s, and by dodging their Women in the particular Corners and Allies of it, catched them in their Arms, and took them from tho&s;e whom they really loved and admired. There was a particular Grove, which was called, <HI>The Labyrinth of Coquets;</HI> where many were en|ticed to the Cha&s;e, but few returned with Pur|cha&s;e. It was plea&s;ant enough to &s;ee a celebra|ted Beauty, by &s;miling upon one, ca&s;ting a Glance upon another, beckoning to a third, and adapt|ing her Charms and Graces to the &s;everal Follies of tho&s;e that admired her, drawing into the La|byrinth a whole Pack of Lovers, that lo&s;t them|&s;elves
<PB N="29" REF="36">
in the Maze, and never could find their Way out of it. However, it was &s;ome Satis|faction to me, to &s;ee many of the Fair Ones who had thus deluded their Followers, and left them among the Intricacies of the Labyrinth, obliged when they came out of it, to &s;urrender to the fir&s;t Partner that offer'd him&s;elf. I now had cro&s;&s;ed over all the difficult and perplexed Pa&s;&s;ages that &s;eemed to bound our Walk, when on the other Side of them, I &s;aw the &s;ame great Road running on a little Way, till it was terminated by two beautiful Temples. I &s;tood here for &s;ome Time, and &s;aw mo&s;t of the Multitude who had been di&s;|per&s;ed among&s;t the Thickets, coming out Two by Two, and marching up in Parts towards the Tem|ples that &s;tood before us. The Structure on the Right Hand was (as I afterwards found) con&s;e|crated to Virtuous Love, and could not be entered but by &s;uch as received a Ring, or &s;ome other Token, from a Per&s;on who was placed as a Guard at the Gate of it. He wore a Garland of Ro&s;es and Myrtles on his Head, and on his Shoul|ders a Robe like an Imperial Mantle, white and un&s;potted all over, excepting only, that where it was cla&s;ped at his Brea&s;t, there were Two golden Turtle-Doves that buttoned it by their Bills, which were wrought in Rubies. He was called by the Name of <HI>Hymen,</HI> and was &s;eated near the En|trance of the Temple, in a delicious Bower, made up of &s;everal Trees, that were embraced by Woodbines, Je&s;&s;amines, and Amaranths, which were as &s;o many Emblems of Marriage, and Or|naments to the Trunks that &s;upported them. As I was &s;ingle and unaccompanied, I was not per|mitted to enter the Temple, and for that Rea&s;on am a Stranger to all the My&s;teries that were per|formed in it. I had however the Curio&s;ity to ob|&s;erve how the &s;everal Couples that entered were di&s;po&s;ed of; which was after the following Man|ner. There were two great Gates on the Back|&s;ide
<PB N="30" REF="37">
of the Edifice, at which the whole Crowd was let out. At one of the&s;e Gates were Two Women, extremely beautiful, tho' in a different Kind, the one having a very careful and compo|&s;ed Air, the other a Sort of Smile and ineffable Sweetne&s;s in her Countenance. The Name of the fir&s;t was <HI>Di&s;cretion,</HI> and of the other <HI>Compla|cency.</HI> All who came out of this Gate, and put them&s;elves under the Direction of the&s;e two Si|&s;ters, were immediately conducted by them into Gardens, Groves, and Meadows, which abounded in Delights, and were furni&s;hed with every Thing that could make them the proper Seats of Happi|ne&s;s. The Second Gate of this Temple let out all the Couples that were unhappily married, who came out linked together by Chains, which each of them &s;trove to break, but could not. Several of the&s;e were &s;uch as had never been acquainted with each other before they met in the great Walk, or had been too well acquainted in the Thicket. The Entrance to this Gate was po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed by three Si&s;ters, who joined them&s;elves with the&s;e Wretches, and occa&s;ioned mo&s;t of their Mi|&s;eries. The younge&s;t of the Si&s;ters was known by the Name of <HI>Levity,</HI> who with the Innocence of a Virgin, had the Dre&s;s and Behaviour of a Harlot. The Name of the Second was <HI>Contention,</HI> who bore on her Right Arm a Muff made of the Skin of a Porcupine; and on her Left carried a little Lap-Dog, that barked and &s;napped at every one that pa&s;&s;ed by her.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t of the Si&s;ters, who &s;eemed to have an haughty and imperious Air, was always ac|companied with a tawny <HI>Cupid,</HI> who generally marched before her with a little Mace on his Shoulder, the End of which was fa&s;hioned into the Horns of a Stag. Her Garments were yel|low, and her Complexion pale. Her Eyes were piercing, but had odd Ca&s;ts in them, and that particular Di&s;temper, which makes Per&s;ons who
<PB N="31" REF="38">
are troubled with it, &s;ee Objects double. Upon Enquiry, I was informed that her Name was <HI>Jealou&s;y.</HI></P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed my Ob&s;ervations upon this Temple, and its Votaries, I repaired to that which &s;tood on the Left Hand, and was called, <HI>The Tem|ple of Lu&s;t.</HI> The Front of it was rai&s;ed on <HI>Corin|thian</HI> Pillars, with all the meretricious Orna|ments that accompany that Order; whereas that of the other was compo&s;ed of the cha&s;t and ma|tron-like <HI>Ionic.</HI> The Sides of it were adorned with &s;everal grote&s;que Figures of Goats, Spar|rows, Heathen Gods, Satyrs, and Mon&s;ters made up of half Man half Bea&s;t. The Gates were un|guarded, and open to all that had a Mind to en|ter. Upon my going in, I found the Windows were blinded, and let in only a Kind of Twilight, that &s;erved to di&s;cover a prodigious Number of dark Corners and Apartments, into which the whole Temple was divided. I was here &s;tunned with a mixed Noi&s;e of Clamour and Jollity: On one Side of me, I heard Singing and Dancing; on the other, Brawls and Cla&s;hing of Swords. In &s;hort, I was &s;o little plea&s;ed with the Place, that I was going out of it; but found I could not return by the Gate where I entered, which was barred again&s;t all that were come in, with Bolts of Iron, and Locks of Adamant. There was no going back from this Temple through the Paths of Plea|&s;ure which led to it: All who pa&s;&s;ed thro' the Ce|remonies of the Place, went out at an Iron Wicket, which was kept by a dreadful Giant called <HI>Remor&s;e,</HI> that held a Scourge of Scorpions in his Hand, and drove them into the only Outlet from that Tem|ple. This was a Pa&s;&s;age, &s;o rugged, &s;o uneven, and choaked with &s;o many Thorns and Briars, that it was a melancholy Spectacle to behold the Pains and Difficulties which both Sexes &s;uffered who walked through it. The Men, tho' in the Prime of their Youth, appeared weak and infee|bled
<PB N="32" REF="39">
with old Age: The Women rung their Hands, and tore their Hair; and &s;everal lo&s;t their Limbs before they could extricate them&s;elves out of the Perplexities of the Path in which they were engaged. The remaining Part of this Vi|&s;ion, and the Adventures I met with in the Two great Roads of Ambition and Avarice, mu&s;t be the Subject of another Paper.</P>

<P>I Was recollecting the Remainder of my Vi&s;ion, when my Maid came to me, and told me, there was a Gentlewoman below who &s;eemed to be in great Trouble, and pre&s;&s;ed very much to &s;ee me. When it lay in my Power to remove the Di&s;tre&s;s of an unhappy Per&s;on, I thought I &s;hould very ill employ my Time in attending Matters of Speculation, and therefore de&s;ired the Lady would walk in. When &s;he entered, I &s;aw her Eyes full of Tears. However, her Grief was not &s;o great as to make her omit Rules; for &s;he was very long and exact in her Civilities, which gave me Time to view and con&s;ider her. Her Clothes were very rich, but tarni&s;h'd; and her Words very fine, but illapplied. The&s;e Di&s;tinctions made me with|out He&s;itation (tho' I had never &s;een her before) ask'd her, If her Lady had any Commands for me? She then began to weep afre&s;h, and with many broken Sighs told me, That their Family was in very great Affliction&mdash;I be&s;eeched her to com|po&s;e her &s;elf, for that I might po&s;&s;ibly be capable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting them&mdash;She then ca&s;t her Eye upon my little Dog, and was again tran&s;ported with too much Pa&s;&s;ion to proceed; but with much ado, &s;he at la&s;t gave me to under&s;tand, That <HI>Cupid,</HI> her Lady's Lap-dog, was dangerou&s;ly ill, and in &s;o bad a Condition, that her Lady neither &s;aw Company, nor went abroad, for which Rea|&s;on
<PB N="34" REF="41">
&s;he did not come her &s;elf to con&s;ult me; that as I had mentioned with great Affection my own Dog, (here &s;he court&s;ied, and looking fir&s;t at the Cur, and then on me, &s;aid, indeed I had Rea&s;on, for he was very pretty) her Lady &s;ent to me ra|ther than to any other Doctor, and hoped I would not laugh at her Sorrow, but &s;end her my Ad|vice. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I had &s;ome Indignation to find my &s;elf treated like &s;omething below a Far|rier; yet well knowing, that the be&s;t, as well as mo&s;t tender Way, of dealing with a Woman, is to fall in with her Humours, and by that Means to let her &s;ee the Ab&s;urdity of them. I proceed|ed accordingly: Pray, Madam, &s;aid I, can you give me any methodical Account of this Illne&s;s, and how <HI>Cupid</HI> was fir&s;t taken? Sir (&s;aid &s;he) we have a little ignorant Country Girl who is kept to tend him: She was recommended to our Fa|mily by one, that my Lady never &s;aw but once, at a Vi&s;it; and you know, Per&s;ons of Quality are always inclined to Strangers; for I could have helped her to a Cou&s;in of my own, but&mdash;Good Madam (&s;aid I) you neglect the Account of the &s;ick Body, while you are complaining of this Girl. No, no, Sir (&s;aid &s;he), begging your Par|don: But it is the general Fault of Phy&s;icians, they are &s;o in Ha&s;te, that they never hear out the Ca&s;e. I &s;ay, this &s;illy Girl, after wa&s;hing <HI>Cupid,</HI> let him &s;tand half an Hour in the Window with|out his Collar, where he catched cold, and in an Hour after began to bark very hoar&s;e. He had however a pretty good Night, and we hoped the Danger was over; but for the&s;e Two Nights la&s;t pa&s;t, neither he nor my Lady have &s;lept a Wink. Has he (&s;aid I) taken any Thing? No (&s;aid &s;he), but my Lady &s;ays, he &s;hall take any Thing that you pre&s;cribe, provided you do not make U&s;e of Je&s;uits Powder, or the Cold Bath. Poor <HI>Cupid</HI> (continued &s;he) has always been Phti&s;ical, and as he lies under &s;omething like a Chin-Cough, we
<PB N="35" REF="42">
are afraid it will end in a Con&s;umption. I then asked her, if &s;he had brought any of his Water to &s;how me. Upon this, &s;he &s;tared me in the Face, and &s;aid, I am afraid, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> you are not &s;erious; but if you have any Receipt that is proper on this Occa&s;ion, pray let us have it; for my Mi&s;tre&s;s is not to be comforted. Upon this, I pan&s;ed a little without returning any An|&s;wer, and after &s;ome &s;hort Silence, I proceeded in the following Manner: I have con&s;idered the Nature of the Di&s;temper, and the Con&s;titution of the Patient, and by the be&s;t Ob&s;ervation that I can make on both, I think it is &s;afe&s;t to put him into a Cour&s;e of Kitchin Phy&s;ick. In the mean time, to remove his Hoar&s;ene&s;s, it will be the mo&s;t natural Way to make <HI>Cupid</HI> his own Drug|gi&s;t; for which Rea&s;on, I &s;hall pre&s;cribe to him, Three Mornings &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, as much Powder as will lie on a Groat, of that noble Remedy which the Apothecaries call <HI>Album Graecum.</HI> Upon hear|ing this Advice, the young Woman &s;miled, as if &s;he knew how ridiculous an Errand &s;he had been employed in; and indeed I found by the Sequel of her Di&s;cour&s;e, That &s;he was an arch Baggage, and of a Character that is frequent enough in Per&s;ons of her Employment, who are &s;o u&s;ed to conform them&s;elves in every Thing to the Hu|mours and Pa&s;&s;ions of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, that they &s;acrifice Superiority of Sen&s;e to Superiority of Condition, and are in&s;en&s;ibly betrayed into the Pa&s;&s;ions and Prejudices of tho&s;e whom they &s;erve, without giving them&s;elves Leave to con&s;ider, that they are extravagant and ridiculous. However I thought it very natural, when her Eyes were thus open, to &s;ee her give a new Turn to her Di&s;cour&s;e, and from &s;ympathizing with her Mi|&s;tre&s;s in her Follies, to fall a Railing at her. You cannot imagine, &s;aid &s;he, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> what a Life &s;he makes us lead for the Sake of this lit|tle ugly Cur: If he dies, we are the mo&s;t unhap|py

Family in Town. She chanced to lo&s;e a Par|rat la&s;t Year, which, to tell you truly, brought me into her Service; for &s;he turned off her Wo|man upon it, who had lived with her Ten Years, becau&s;e &s;he neglected to give him Water, tho' every one of the Family &s;ays, &s;he was as innocent of the Bird's Death, as the Babe that is unborn. Nay, &s;he told me this very Morning, That if <HI>Cupid</HI> &s;hould die, &s;he would &s;end the poor inno|cent Wench I was telling you of, to <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and have the Milk-Woman tried for her Life at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> for putting Water into his Milk. In &s;hort, &s;he talks like any di&s;tracted Creature.</P>
<P>Since it is &s;o, young Woman (&s;aid I), I will by no Means let you offend her, by &s;taying on this Me&s;&s;age longer than is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;o forced her out.</P>
<P>While I am &s;tudying to cure tho&s;e Evils and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es that are nece&s;&s;ary or natural to Humane Life, I find my Task growing upon me, &s;ince by the&s;e accidental Cares, and acquired Calamities, (if I may &s;o call them) my Patients contract Di|&s;tempers to which their Con&s;titution is of it &s;elf a Stranger. But this is an Evil I have for many Years remarked in the Fair Sex; and as they are by Nature very much formed for Affection and Dal|liance, I have ob&s;erved, That when by too ob&s;tinate a Cruelty, or any other Means, they have di&s;ap|pointed them&s;elves of the proper Objects of Love, as Husbands, or Children, &s;uch Virgins have ex|actly at &s;uch a Year grown fond of Lap-dogs, Parrats, or other Animals. I know at this Time a celebrated Toa&s;t, whom I allow to be one of the mo&s;t agreeable of her Sex, that in the Pre|&s;ence of her Admirers, will give a Torrent of Ki&s;&s;es to her Cat, any one of which a Chri&s;tian would be glad of. I do not at the &s;ame Time deny, but there are as great Enormities of this Kind committed by our Sex as theirs. A <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor had &s;o very great an E&s;teem for an Hor&s;e
<PB N="37" REF="44">
of his, that he had Thoughts of making him a Con&s;ul; and &s;everal Moderns of that Rank of Men whom we call Country Squires, won't &s;cru|ple to ki&s;s their Hounds before all the World, and declare in the Pre&s;ence of their Wives, that they had rather &s;alute a Favourite of the Pack, than the fine&s;t Woman in <HI>England.</HI> The&s;e vo|luntary Friend&s;hips between Animals of different Species, &s;eem to ari&s;e from In&s;tinct; for which Rea&s;on, I have always looked upon the mutual good Will between the 'Squire and the Hound, to be of the &s;ame Nature with that between the Lion and the Jackall.</P>
<P>The only Extravagance of this Kind which ap|pears to me excu&s;able, is one that grew out of an Exce&s;s of Gratitude, which I have &s;omewhere met with in the Life of a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperor. His Hor&s;e had brought him &s;afe out of a Field of Battle, and from the Pur&s;uit of a victorious Ene|my. As a Reward for &s;uch his good and faithful Service, his Ma&s;ter built him a Stable of Marble, &s;hod him with Gold, fed him in an Ivory Man|ger, and made him a Rack of Silver. He an|nex'd to the Stable &s;everal Fields and Meadows, Lakes, and running Streams. At the &s;ame time he provided for him a Seraglio of Mares, the mo&s;t beautiful that could be found in the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. To the&s;e were added a &s;uita|ble Train of Dome&s;ticks, con&s;i&s;ting of Grooms, Farriers, Rubbers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> accommodated with pro|per Liveries and Pen&s;ions. In &s;hort, nothing was omitted that could contribute to the Ea&s;e and Happine&s;s of his Life who had pre&s;erved the Em|peror's.</P>

<P>I Find it is thought nece&s;&s;ary, that I (who have taken upon me to cen&s;ure the Irregularities of the Age) &s;hould give an Account of my own Actions when they appear doubtful, or &s;ubject to Mi&s;con&s;truction. My appearing at the Play on <HI>Monday</HI> la&s;t, is looked upon as a Step in my Con|duct, which I ought to explain, that others may not be mi&s;led by my Example. It is true in Mat|ter of Fact, I was pre&s;ent at the ingenious Enter|tainment of that Day, and placed my &s;elf in a Box which was prepared for me with great Civi|lity and Di&s;tinction. It is &s;aid of <HI>Virgil,</HI> when he entered a <HI>Roman</HI> Theatre, where there were many Thou&s;ands of Spectators pre&s;ent, That the whole A&s;&s;embly ro&s;e up to do him Honour; a Re&s;pect which was never before paid to any but the Emperor. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, That univer&s;al Clap, and other Te&s;timonies of Applau&s;e, with which I was received at my fir&s;t Appearance in the Theatre of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> gave me as &s;en&s;ible a Delight, as the above-mentioned Reception could give to that Immortal Poet. I &s;hould be ungrateful at the &s;ame Time, if I did not take this Opportunity of acknowledging the great Ci|vilities that were &s;hown me by Mr. <HI>Thomas Dog|get,</HI> who made his Compliments to me between the Acts, after a mo&s;t ingenuous and di&s;creet Manner; and at the &s;ame Time communicated to me, that the Company of Upholders de&s;ired to receive me at their Door at the End of the <HI>Har|market,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="46">
and to light me home to my Lodgings. That Part of the Ceremony I forbad, and took particular Care during the whole Play to ob&s;erve the Conduct of the <HI>Drama,</HI> and give no Offence by my own Behaviour. Here I think it will not be foreign to my Character, to lay down the pro|per duties of an Audience, and what is incum|bent upon each individual Spectator in publick Diver&s;ions of this Nature. Every one &s;hould on the&s;e Occa&s;ions &s;how his Attention, Under&s;tand|ing and Virtue. I would undertake to find out all the Per&s;ons of Sen&s;e and Breeding by the Ef|fect of a &s;ingle Sentence, and to di&s;tingui&s;h a Gen|tleman as much by his Laugh, as his Bow. When we &s;ee the Footman and his Lord diverted by the &s;ame Je&s;t, it very much turns to the Dimi|nution of the one, or the Honour of the other. But tho' a Man's Quality may appear in his Un|der&s;tanding and Ta&s;t, the Regard to Virtue ought to be the &s;ame in all Ranks and Conditions of Men, however they make a Profe&s;&s;ion of it un|der the Name of Honour, Religion, or Morali|ty. When therefore we &s;ee any Thing divert an Audience, either in Traged or Comedy, that &s;trikes at the Duties of Civil Life, or expo&s;es what the be&s;t Men in all Ages have looked up|on as &s;acred and inviolable, it is the certain Sign of a pro&s;ligate Race of Men, who are fallen from the Virtue of their Forefathers, and will be contemptible in the Eyes of their Po&s;terity. For this Rea&s;on I took great Delight in &s;eeing the generous and di&s;intere&s;ted Pa&s;&s;ion of the Lovers in this Comedy (which &s;tood &s;o many Trials, and was proved by &s;uch a Variety of diverting Incidents) received with an univer&s;al Approba|tion. This brings to my Mind a Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Ci|cero,</HI> which I could never read without being in Love with the Virtue of a <HI>Roman</HI> Audience. He there de&s;cribes the Shouts and Applau&s;es which the People gave to the Per&s;ons who acted the
<PB N="40" REF="47">
Parts of <HI>Pilades</HI> and <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> in the noble&s;t Oc|ea&s;ion that a Poet could invent to &s;how Friend|&s;hip in Perfection. One of them had forfeited his Life by an Action which he had committed; and as they &s;tood in Judgment before the Ty|rant, each of them &s;trove who &s;hould be the Criminal, that he might &s;ave the Life of his Friend. Amid&s;t the Vehemence of each a&s;&s;erting him&s;elf to be the Offender, the <HI>Roman</HI> Au|dience gave a Thunder of Applau&s;e, and by that Means, as the Author hints, approved in others what they would have done them&s;elves on the like Occa&s;ion. Methinks, a People of &s;o much Virtue were de&s;ervedly placed at the Head of Mankind: But alas! Plea&s;ures of this Nature are not frequently to be met with on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians,</HI> at a Time when they were the mo&s;t polite, as well as the mo&s;t powerful, Go|vernment in the World, made the Care of the Stage one of the chief Parts of the Admini&s;tra|tion: And I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am a&s;toni&s;hed at the Spirit of Virtue which appeared in that Peo|ple upon &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions in a Scene of a fa|mous Tragedy; an Account of which we have in one of <HI>Seneca</HI>'s Epi&s;tles. A coverous Per&s;on is repre&s;ented &s;peaking the common Sentiments of all who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with that Vice in the following Soliloquy, which I have tran&s;lated literally.</P>
<Q>Let me be called a ba&s;e Man, &s;o I am called a rich one. If a Man is rich, who asks if he is good? The Que&s;tion is. How much we have; not from whence, or by what Means, we have it. Every one has &s;o much Merit as he has Wealth. For my own Part, let me be rich, Oh ye Gods! or let me die. The Man dies happily, who dies increa&s;ing his Trea|&s;ure. There is more Plea&s;ure in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="41" REF="48">
Wealth, than in that of Parents, Children, Wife, or Friends.</Q>
<P>The Audience were very much provoked by the fir&s;t Words of this Speech; but when the Actor came to the Clo&s;e of it, they could bear no longer. In &s;hort, the whole A&s;&s;embly ro&s;e up at once in the greate&s;t Fury, with a De&s;ign to pluck him off the Stage, and brand the Work it &s;elf with Infamy. In the Mid&s;t of the Tumult, the Author came out from behind the Scenes, begging the Audience to be compo&s;ed for a little while, and they &s;hould &s;ee the Tragical End which this Wretch &s;hould come to immediately. The Promi&s;e of Puni&s;hment appea&s;ed the People, who &s;at with great Attention and Plea&s;ure to &s;ee an Example made of &s;o odious a Criminal. It is with shame and Concern that I &s;peak it; but I very much que&s;tion, whether it is po&s;&s;ible to make a Speech &s;o impious, as to rai&s;e &s;uch a lau|dable Horror and Indignation in a Modern Au|dience. It is very natural for an Author to make O&s;tentation of his Reading, as it is for an old Man to tell Stories; for which Rea&s;on I mu&s;t beg the Reader will excu&s;e me, if I for once in|dulge my &s;elf in both the&s;e Inclinations. We &s;ee the Attention, Judgment and Virtue of a whole Audience, in the foregoing In&s;tances. If we would imitate the Behaviour of a &s;ingle Specta|tor, let us reflect upon that of <HI>Socrates,</HI> in a Par|ticular which gives me as great an Idea of that extraordinary Man, as any Circum&s;tance of his Life; or what is more, of his Death. This ve|nerable Per&s;on often frequented the Theatre, which brought a great many thither, out of a De&s;ire to &s;ee him. On which Occa&s;ion it is re|corded of him, That he &s;ometimes &s;tood to make him&s;elf the more con&s;picuous, and to &s;atis|fy the Curio&s;ity of the Beholders. He was one Day pre&s;ent at the fir&s;t Repre&s;entation of a Tra|gedy
<PB N="42" REF="49">
of <HI>Euripides,</HI> who was his intimate Friend, and whom he is &s;aid to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;everal of his Plays. In the Mid&s;t of the Tragedy, which had met with very great Succe&s;s, there chanc'd to be a Line that &s;eemed to encourage Vice and Immorality.</P>
<P>This was no &s;ooner &s;poken, but <HI>Socrates</HI> ro&s;e from his Seat, and without any Regard to his Affection for his Friend, or to the Succe&s;s of the Play, &s;howed him&s;elf di&s;plea&s;ed at what was &s;aid, and walked out of the A&s;&s;embly. I que|&s;tion not but the Reader will be curious to know what the Line was that gave this Divine Hea|then &s;o much Offence. If my Memory fails me not, it was in the Part of <HI>Hippolitus,</HI> who when he is pre&s;&s;ed by an Oath, which he had taken to keep Silence, returned for An&s;wer, That he had taken the Oath with his Tongue, but not with his Heart. Had a Per&s;on of a vicious Character made &s;uch a Speech, it might have been allowed as a proper Repre&s;entation of the Ba&s;ene&s;s of his Thoughts: But &s;uch an Expre&s;|&s;ion out of the Mouth of the virtuous <HI>Hippolitus,</HI> was giving a Sanction to Fal&s;hood, and e&s;tabli&s;h|ing Perjury by a Maxim.</P>
<P>Having got over all Interruptions, I have &s;et apart to Morrow for the clo&s;ing of my Vi&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>A Continuation of the Vi&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>WITH much Labour and Difficulty I pa&s;|&s;ed through the fir&s;t Part of my Vi&s;ion, and recovered the Centre of the Wood, from whence I had the Pro&s;pect of the Three great Roads. I here joined my &s;elf to the middle-aged Party of Mankind, who marched behind the Standard of Ambition. The great Road lay in a direct Line, and was terminated by the <HI>Temple of Virtue.</HI> It was planted on each Side with Lawrels, which were intermixed with Marble Trophies, Carved Pillars, and Statues of Law|givers, Heroes, State&s;men, Philo&s;ophers, and Poets. The Per&s;ons who travelled up this great Path, were &s;uch who&s;e Thoughts were bent upon doing eminent Services to Mankind, or promoting the Good of their Country. On each Side of this great Road were &s;everal Paths, that were al&s;o laid out in &s;traight Lines, and ran parallel with it. The&s;e were mo&s;t of them covered Walks, and received into them Men of retired Virtue, who propo&s;ed to them&s;elves the &s;ame End of their Journey, tho' they cho&s;e to make it in Shade and Ob&s;curity. The Edifices at the Extremity of the Walk were &s;o contrived, that we could not &s;ee the <HI>Temple of Honour</HI> by rea&s;on of the <HI>Temple of Virtue,</HI> which &s;tood before it.
<PB N="44" REF="51">
At the Gates of this Temple we were met b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Godde&s;s of it, who conducted us into tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>of Honour,</HI> which was joined to the other Edi+fice by a beautiful Triumphal Arch, and had no other Entrance into it. When the Deity of the Inner Structure had received us, &s;he pre&s;ented us in a Body to a Figure that was placed over the high Altar, and was the Emblem of Eternity. She &s;at on a Globe in the mid&s;t of a Golden Zodiac, holding the Figure of a Sun in one Hand, and a Moon in the other. Her Head was veiled, and her Feet covered. Our Hearts glowed within us as we &s;tood amid&s;t the Sphere of Light which this Image ca&s;t on every Side of it.</P>
<P>Having &s;een all that happen'd to this Band of Adventurers, I repaired to another Pile of Build|ing that &s;tood within View of the <HI>Temple of Honour,</HI> and was rai&s;ed in Imitation of it, upon the very &s;ame Model; but at my Approach to it, I found, that the Stones were laid together without Mortar, and that the whole Fabrick &s;tood upon &s;o weak a Foundation, that it &s;hook with every Wind that blew. This was called the <HI>Temple of Vanity.</HI> The Godde&s;s of it &s;at in the mid&s;t of a great many Tapers, that burned Day and Night, and made her appear much bet|ter than &s;he would have done in open Day-light. Her whole Art, was to &s;how her &s;elf more beau|tiful and maje&s;tick than &s;he really was. For which Rea&s;on, &s;he had painted her Face, and wore a Clu&s;ter of fal&s;e Jewels upon her Brea&s;t: But what I more particularly ob&s;erved, was, the Breadth of her Petticoat, which was made alto|gether in the Fa&s;hion of a modern Fardingal. This Place was filled with Hypocrites, Pedants, Free-Thinkers, and prating Politicians; with a Rabble of tho&s;e who have only Titles to make them great Men. Female Votaries crowded the Temple, choak'd up the Avenues of it, and
<PB N="45" REF="52">
were more in Number than the Sand upon the Sea-&s;hore. I made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s in my Return towards that Part of the Wood from whence I fir&s;t &s;et out, to ob&s;erve the Walks which led to this Temple; for I met in it &s;everal who had be|gun their Journey with the Band of virtuous Per&s;ons, and travelled &s;ome Time in their Com|pany: But upon Examination I found, that there were &s;everal Paths which led out of the great Road into the Sides of the Wood, and ran into &s;o many crooked Turns and Windings, that tho&s;e who travelled thro' them often turned their Backs upon the <HI>Temple of Virtue,</HI> then cro&s;&s;ed the &s;traight Road, and &s;ometimes marched in it for a little Space, till the crooked Path which they were engaged in again led them into the Wood. The &s;everal Alleys of the&s;e Wanderers had their particular Ornaments: One of them I could not but take Notice of, in the Walk of the mi&s;chie|vous Pretenders to Politicks, which had at every Turn the Figure of a Per&s;on, whom by the In&s;cription I found to be <HI>Machiavel,</HI> pointing out the Way with an extended Finger like a <HI>Mercury.</HI></P>
<P>I was now returned in the &s;ame Manner as be|fore, with a De&s;ign to ob&s;erve carefully every Thing that pa&s;&s;ed in the Region of <HI>Avarice,</HI> and the Occurrences in that A&s;&s;embly, which was made up of Per&s;ons of my own Age. This Body of Travellers had not gone far in the Third great Road, before it led them in&s;en&s;ibly into a deep Valley, in which they journied &s;everal Days with great Toil and Unea&s;ine&s;s, and with|out the nece&s;&s;ary Refre&s;hments of Food and Sleep. The only Relief they met with, was in a River that ran through the Bottom of the Valley on a Bed of Golden Sand: They often drank of this Stream, which had &s;uch a particular Quality in it, that tho' it refre&s;hed them for a Time, it
<PB N="46" REF="53">
rather inflamed than quenched their Thir&s;t. On each Side of the River was a Range of Hills full of precious Ore; for where the Rains had wa&s;h'd off the Earth, one might &s;ee in &s;everal Parts of them long Viens of Gold, and Rocks that looked like pure Silver. We were told, That the Deity of the Place had forbad any of his Votaries to dig into the Bowels of the&s;e Hills, or convert the Trea&s;ures they contained to any U&s;e, under Pain of Starving. At the End of the Valley &s;tood <HI>The Temple of Avarice,</HI> made after the Manner of a Fortification, and &s;urrounded with a thou|&s;and tripple-headed Dogs, that were placed there to keep off Beggars. At our Approach they all fell a Barking, and would have very much ter|rified us, had not an old Woman who had called her &s;elf by the forged Name of <HI>Competency</HI> of|fered her &s;elf for our Guide. She carrried under her Garment a Golden Bow, which &s;he no &s;oon|er held up in her Hand, but the Dogs lay down, and the Gates flew open for our Reception. We were led through an Hundred Iron Doors, before we entered the Temple. At the upper End of it &s;at the God of <HI>Avarice,</HI> with a long filthy Beard, and a meagre &s;tarved Countenance, enclo&s;ed with Heaps of Ingots, and Pyramids of Money, but half naked and &s;hivering with Cold. On his Right Hand was a Fiend called <HI>Rapine,</HI> and on his Left a particular Favourite to whom he had given the Title of <HI>Par&s;imony.</HI> The Fir&s;t was his Collector, and the other his Ca&s;hier.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal long Tables placed on each Side of the Temple, with re&s;pective Officers at|tending behind them. Some of the&s;e I enquired into. At the fir&s;t Table was kept the Office of <HI>Corruption.</HI> Seeing a Solicitor extremely bu&s;y, and whi&s;pering every Body that pa&s;&s;ed by, I kept my Eye upon him very attentively, and &s;aw him often going up to a Per&s;on that had a Pen in his Hand, with a Multiplication Table and an Al|manack
<PB N="47" REF="54">
before him, which as I afterwards heard, was all the Learning he was Ma&s;ter of. The Soli|citor would often apply him&s;elf to his Ear, and at the &s;ame Time convey Money into his Hand, for which the other would give him out a Piece of Paper or Parchment, &s;igned and &s;ealed in Form. The Name of this dextrous and &s;ucce&s;sful Soli|citor was <HI>Bribery.</HI> At the next Table was the Office of <HI>Extortion.</HI> Behind it &s;ate a Per&s;on in a Bob-Wig, counting over a great Sum of Money. He gave out little Pur&s;es to &s;everal, who after a &s;hort Tour brought him, in Return, Sacks full of the &s;ame Kind of Coin. I &s;aw at the &s;ame Time a Per&s;on called <HI>Fraud,</HI> who &s;ate behind a Counter with fal&s;e Scales, light Weights, and &s;canty Mea&s;ures; by the skilful Application of which In&s;truments, &s;he had got together an im|men&s;e Heap of Wealth. It would be endle&s;s to name the &s;everal Officers, or de&s;cribe the Vora|ries that attended in this Temple. There were many old Men panting and breathle&s;s, repo&s;ing their Heads on Bags of Money; nay many of them actually dying, who&s;e very Pangs and Con|vul&s;ions (which rendered their Pur&s;es u&s;ele&s;s to them) only made them gra&s;p 'em the fa&s;ter. There were &s;ome tearing with one Hand all Things, even to the Garments and Fle&s;h of ma|ny mi&s;erable Per&s;ons who &s;tood before them, and with the other Hand, throwing away what they had &s;eized, to Harlots, Flatterers, and Pan|ders, that &s;tood behind them.</P>
<P>On a &s;udden the whole A&s;&s;embly fell a trem|bling, and upon Enquiry, I found, that the great Room we were in was haunted with a Spectre, that many Times a Day appeared to them, and terrified them to Di&s;traction.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of their Terror and Amazement, the Apparition entered, which I immediate|ly knew to be <HI>Poverty.</HI> Whether it were by my Acquaintance with this Phantom, which
<PB N="48" REF="55">
had render'd the Sight of her more familiar to me, or however it was, &s;he did not make &s;o indi|gent or frightful a Figure in my Eye as the God of this loath&s;ome Temple. The mi&s;erable Vota|ries of this Place were, I found, of another Mind. Every one fancied him&s;elf threatned by the Apparition as &s;he &s;talked about the Room, and began to lock their Coffers, and tie their Bags, with the utmo&s;t Fear and Trembling.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I look upon the Pa&s;&s;ion which I &s;aw in this unhappy People to be of the &s;ame Nature with tho&s;e unaccountable Antipathies which &s;ome Per&s;ons are born with, or rather as a kind of Phren&s;y, not unlike that which throws a Man into Terrors and Agonies at the Sight of &s;o u&s;eful and innocent a Thing as Water. The whole A&s;&s;embly was &s;urpri&s;ed, when, in&s;tead of paying my Devotions to the Deity whom they all adored, they &s;aw me addre&s;s my &s;elf to the Phantom.</P>
<Q>Oh <HI>Poverty!</HI> (&s;aid I) my fir&s;t Petition to thee is, That thou would&s;t never appear to me hereafter; but if thou wilt not grant me this, that thou would&s;t not bear a Form more terrible than that in which thou appeare&s;t to me at pre|&s;ent. Let not thy Threats and Menaces betray me to any Thing that is ungrateful or unju&s;t. Let me not &s;hut my Ears to the Cries of the Needy. Let me not forget the Per&s;on that has de&s;erved well of me. Let me not, for any Fear of thee, de&s;ert my Friend, my Principles, or my Honour. If Wealth is to vi&s;it me, and to come with her u&s;ual Attendants, <HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Avarice,</HI> do thou, Oh <HI>Poverty!</HI> ha&s;ten to my Re&s;cue; but bring along with thee the two Si&s;ters, in who&s;e Company thou art always chearful, <HI>Li|berty</HI> and <HI>Innocence.</HI></Q>

<P>I Went on <HI>Saturday</HI> la&s;t to make a Vi&s;it in the City; and as I pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> I &s;aw Crowds of People turning down towards the <HI>Bank,</HI> and &s;truggling who &s;hould fir&s;t get their Money into the new-erected Lottery. It gave me a great Notion of the Credit of our pre&s;ent Go|vernment and Admini&s;tration, to find People pre&s;s as eagerly to pay Money, as they would to re|ceive it; and at the &s;ame Time a due Re&s;pect for that Body of Men who have found out &s;o plea|&s;ing an Expedient for carrying on the Common Cau&s;e, that they have turned a Tax into a Diver|&s;ion. The Chearfulne&s;s of Spirit, and the Hopes of Succe&s;s, which this Project has occa&s;ioned in this great City, lightens the Burden of the War, and puts me in Mind of &s;ome Games which they &s;ay were invented by wi&s;e Men who were Lovers of their Country, to make their Fellow-Citizens undergo the Tediou&s;ne&s;s and Fatigues of a long Siege. I think there is a Kind of Homage due to Fortune, (if I may call it &s;o) and that I &s;hould be wanting to my &s;elf if I did not lay in my Pre|tences to her Favour, and pay my Compliments to her by Recommending a Ticket to her Di&s;po|&s;al. For this Rea&s;on, upon my Return to my Lodgings, I &s;old off a Couple of Globes and a Tele&s;cope, which, with the Ca&s;h I had by me,
<PB N="50" REF="57">
rai&s;ed the Sum that was requi&s;ite for that Purpo&s;e. I find by my Calculations, that it is but an Hun|dred and Fifty Thou&s;and to One again&s;t my be|ing worth a Thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> for Thirty two Years; and if any Plumb in the City will lay me an Hundred and Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds to Twenty Shillings (which is an even Bett) that I am not this fortunate Man, I will take the Wager, and &s;hall look upon him as a Man of &s;ingular Courage and Fair-dealing, having given Orders to Mr. <HI>Morphew</HI> to &s;ub&s;cribe &s;uch a Policy in my Behalf, if any Per&s;on accepts of the Offer. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have had &s;uch private Intimations from the Twinkling of a certain Star in &s;ome of my A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations, that I &s;hould be unwilling to take Fifty Pounds a Year for my Chance, unle&s;s it were to oblige a parti|cular Friend. My chief Bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent is, to prepare my Mind for this Change of Fortune: For as <HI>Seneca,</HI> who was a greater Morali&s;t, and a much richer Man than I &s;hall be with this Addi|tion to my pre&s;ent Income, &s;ays, <HI>Munera i&s;ta For|tune putatis?

Quality. It was impo&s;&s;ible for me to make an In&s;pection into my own Fortune on this Occa&s;ion, without &s;eeing at the &s;ame Time the Fate of o|thers who are embarked in the &s;ame Adventure. And indeed it was a great Plea&s;ure to me to ob|&s;erve, That the War, which generally impove|ri&s;hes tho&s;e who furni&s;h out the Expence of it, will by this Means give E&s;tates to &s;ome, without making others the poorer for it. I have lately &s;een &s;everal in Liveries, who will give as good of their own very &s;uddenly; and took a particular Satisfaction in the Sight of a young Country Wench, whom I this Morning pa&s;&s;ed by as &s;he was whirling her Mop, with her Petticoats tucked up very agreeably, who, if there is any Truth in my Art, is within Ten Months of being the hand|&s;ome&s;t great Fortune in Town. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was &s;o &s;truck with the Fore&s;ight of what &s;he is to be, that I treated her accordingly, and &s;aid to her, Pray, young Lady, permit me to pa&s;s by. I would for this Rea&s;on advi&s;e all Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es to carry it with great Moderation and Conde&s;cention towards their Servants till next <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> le&s;t the Superiority at that Time &s;hould be inverted. I mu&s;t likewi&s;e admoni&s;h all my Brethren and Fellow-Adventurers, to fill their Minds with proper Arguments for their Support and Con&s;olation in ca&s;e of ill Succe&s;s. It &s;o hap|pens in this Particular, that though the Gainers will have Rea&s;on to rejoice, the Lo&s;ers will have no Rea&s;on to complain. I remember, the Day after the Thou&s;and Pound Prize was drawn in the Penny Lottery, I went to vi&s;it a &s;plenatick Ac|quaintance of mine, who was under much De|jection, and &s;eemed to me to have &s;uffered &s;ome great Di&s;appointment. Upon Enquiry, I found he had put Two-pence for him&s;elf and his Son into the Lottery, and that neither of them had drawn the Thou&s;and Pound. Hereupon this un|lucky Per&s;on took Occa&s;ion to enumerate the
<PB N="52" REF="59">
Misfortunes of his Life, and concluded with tel|ling me, That he never was &s;ucce&s;sful in any of his Undertakings. I was forced to comfort him with the common Reflection upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, That Men of the greate&s;t Merit are not always Men of the greate&s;t Succe&s;s, and that Per&s;ons of his Character mu&s;t not expect to be as happy as Fools. I &s;hall proceed in the like Manner with my Rivals and Competitors for the Thou&s;and Pounds a Year which we are now in Pur&s;uit of; and that I may give general Content to the whole Body of Candidates, I &s;hall allow all that draw Prizes to be fortunate, and all that mi&s;s them to be wi&s;e.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not here omit to acknowledge, that I have received &s;everal Letters upon this Subject, but find one common Error running through them all, which is, That the Writers of them be|lieve their Fate in the&s;e Ca&s;es depends upon the A&s;trologer, and not upon the Stars, as in the fol|lowing Letter from one, who, I fear, flatters him|&s;elf with Hopes of Succe&s;s, which are altogether groundle&s;s, &s;ince he does not &s;eem to me &s;o great a Fool as he takes him&s;elf to be.</P>

<P>COming to Town, and finding my Friend Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> dead and buried, and you the only Conjurer in Repute, I am under a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of applying my &s;elf to you for a Favour, which neverthele&s;s I confe&s;s it would better be|come a Friend to ask, than one who is, as I am, altogether a Stranger to you; but Poverty, you know, is impudent; and as that gives me the Occa&s;ion, &s;o that alone could give me the Con|fidence to be thus importunate.</P>
<P>I am, Sir, very poor, and very de&s;irous to be otherwi&s;e: I have got Ten Pounds, which I de|&s;ign to venture in the Lottery now on foot. What I de&s;ire of you is, that by your Art, you will

'Tis po&s;&s;ible, after this free Confe&s;&s;ion of mine, you may think I don't de&s;erve to be rich; but I hope you'll like|wi&s;e ob&s;erve, I can ill afford to be poor. My own Opinion is, I am well qualified for an E&s;tate, and have a good Title to Luck in a Lot|tery; but I re&s;ign my &s;elf wholly to your Mercy, not without Hopes that you will con&s;i|der, the le&s;s I de&s;erve, the greater the Genero&s;ity in you. If you reject me, I have agreed with an Acquaintance of mine to bury me for my Ten Pounds. I once more recommend my &s;elf to your Favour, and bid you <HI>Adieu.</HI></P>

<P>THere is a Sect of ancient Philo&s;ophers, who, I think, have left more Volumes behind them, and tho&s;e better written, than any other of the Fraternities in Philo&s;ophy. It was a Maxim of this Sect, That all tho&s;e who do not live up to the Principles of Rea&s;on and Virtue, are Madmen. Every one, who governs him&s;elf by the&s;e Rules, is allowed the Title of Wi&s;e, and reputed to be in his Sen&s;es; and every one in Proportion, as he deviates from them, is pronounced Frantick and Di&s;tracted. <HI>Cicero</HI> having cho&s;en this Maxim for his Theme, takes Occa&s;ion to argue from it very agreeably with <HI>Clodius,</HI> his implacable Adver&s;ary, who had procured his Bani&s;hment. A City (&s;ays he) is an A&s;&s;embly di&s;tingui&s;hed into Bodies of Men, who are in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their re&s;pective Rights and Privileges, ca&s;t under proper Subor|dinations, and in all its Parts obedient to the Rules of Law and Equity. He then repre&s;ents the Government from whence he was bani&s;hed, at a Time when the Con&s;ul, Senate, and Laws, had lo&s;t their Authority, as a Commonwealth of Lu|naricks. For this Rea&s;on, he regards his Expul|&s;ion from <HI>Rome,</HI> as a Man would being turned out of <HI>Bedlam,</HI> if the Inhabitants of it &s;hould drive
<PB N="55" REF="62">
him out of their Walls as a Per&s;on unfit for their Community. We are therefore to look upon every Man's Brain to be touched, however he may appear in the general Conduct of his Life, if he has an unju&s;tifiable Singularity in any Part of his Conver&s;ation or Behaviour: Or if he &s;werves from right Rea&s;on, however common his Kind of Madne&s;s may be, we &s;hall not excu&s;e him for its being epidemical, it being our pre&s;ent De&s;ign to clap up all &s;uch as have the Marks of Madne&s;s upon them, who are now permitted to go about the Streets, for no other Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e they do no Mi&s;chief in their Fits. Abundance of ima|ginary great Men are put in Straw to bring them to a right Sen&s;e of them&s;elves: And is it not al|together as rea&s;onable, that an in&s;ignificant Man, who has an immoderate Opinion of his Merits, and a quite different Notion of his own Abilities from what the re&s;t of the World entertain, &s;hould have the &s;ame Care taken of him, as a Beggar who fancies him&s;elf a Duke or a Prince? Or, Why &s;hould a Man, who &s;tarves in the Mid&s;t of Plenty, be tru&s;ted with him&s;elf, more than he who fancies he is an Emperor in the Mid&s;t of Poverty? I have &s;everal Women of Quality in my Thoughts, who &s;et &s;o exorbitant a Value upon them&s;elves, that I have often mo&s;t heartily pitied them, and wi&s;hed them, for their Recovery, under the &s;ame Di&s;cipline with the Pewterer's Wife. I find by &s;everal Hints in ancient Authors, that when the <HI>Romans</HI> were in the Height of Power and Luxu|ry, they a&s;&s;igned out of their va&s;t Dominions an I&s;land called <HI>Anticyra,</HI> as an Habitation for Mad|men. This was the Bedlam of the <HI>Roman</HI> Em|pire, whither all Per&s;ons who had lo&s;t their Wits u&s;ed to re&s;ort from all Parts of the World in Que&s;t of them. Several of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors were advi&s;ed to repair to this I&s;land; but mo&s;t of them, in&s;tead of li&s;tening to &s;uch &s;ober Coun&s;els, gave Way to their Di&s;traction, till the People
<PB N="56" REF="63">
knocked them in the Head as de&s;pairing of their Cure. In &s;hort, it was as u&s;ual for Men of di&s;tem|pered Brains to take a Voyage to <HI>Anticyra</HI> in tho&s;e Days, as it is in ours for Per&s;ons who have a Di&s;|order in their Lungs to go to <HI>Montpellier.</HI></P>
<P>The prodigious Crops of Hellebore with which this whole I&s;land abounded, did not only furni&s;h them with incomparable Tea, Snuff, and <HI>Hungary</HI> Water, but impregnated the Air of the Country with &s;uch &s;ober and &s;alutiferous Steams, as very much comforted the Heads, and refre&s;hed the Sen|&s;es, of all that breathed in it. A di&s;carded State&s;|man, that at his fir&s;t Landing appeared &s;tark &s;ta|ring mad, would become calm in a Week's Time; and upon his Return Home, live ea&s;y and &s;atisfied in his Retirement. A moaping Lover would grow a plea&s;ant Fellow by that Time he had rid thrice about the I&s;land; and a hair-brained Rake, after a &s;hort Stay in the Country, go Home again a compo&s;ed, grave, worthy Gentleman.</P>
<P>I have premi&s;ed the&s;e Particulars before I enter on the main De&s;ign of this Paper, becau&s;e I would not be thought altogether notional in what I have to &s;ay, and pa&s;s only for a Projector in Morality. I could quote <HI>Horace,</HI> and <HI>Seneca,</HI> and &s;ome other ancient Writers of good Repute, upon the &s;ame Occa&s;ion, and make out by their Te&s;timony, that our Streets are filled with di&s;tracted Per&s;ons; that our Shops and Taverns, private and publick Hou|&s;es, &s;warm with them; and that it is very hard to make up a tolerable A&s;&s;embly without a Majo|rity of them. But what I have already &s;aid, is, I hope, &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the en&s;uing Project, which I &s;hall therefore give &s;ome Account of without any further Preface.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It is humbly propo&s;ed, That a proper Recep|tacle or Habitation be forthwith erected for all &s;uch Per&s;ons as, upon due Trial and Examination, &s;hall appear to be out of their Wits.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="57" REF="64">
2. That to &s;erve the pre&s;ent Exigency, the Col|lege in <HI>Moor-Fields</HI> be very much extended at both Ends; and that it be converted into a Square, by adding three other Sides to it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That no Body be admitted into the&s;e Three additional Sides, but &s;uch who&s;e Phren&s;y can lay no Claim to an Apartment in that Row of Build|ing which is already erected.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That the Architect, Phy&s;ician, Apothecary, Surgeon, Keepers, Nur&s;es, and Porters, be all and each of them crack'd, provided that their Phren&s;y does not lie in the Profe&s;&s;ion or Employment to which they &s;hall &s;everally and re&s;pectively be a&s;|&s;igned. <P>N.B. <HI>It is thought fit to give the foregoing Notice, that none may pre&s;ent him&s;elf here for any Po&s;t of Honour or Profit who is not duly qualified.</HI></P></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That over all the Gates of the additional Buildings, there be Figures placed in the &s;ame Manner as over the Entrance of the Edifice already erected; provided, they repre&s;ent &s;uch Di&s;tracti|ons only as are proper for tho&s;e additional Build|ings; as, of an envious Man gnawing his own Fle&s;h, a Game&s;ter pulling him&s;elf by the Ears, and knocking his Head again&s;t a Marble Pillar, a covetous Man warming him&s;elf over a Heap of Gold, a Coward flying from his own Shadow, and the like.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Having laid down this general Scheme of my De&s;ign, I do hereby invite all Per&s;ons who are willing to encourage &s;o publick-&s;pirited a Project, to bring in their Contributions as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and to apprehend forthwith any Politician whom they &s;hall catch raving in a Coffee-hou&s;e, or any Free-thinker whom they &s;hall find publi&s;hing his Deliriums, or any other Per&s;on who &s;hall give the like manife&s;t Signs of a crazed Imagination: And I do at the &s;ame Time give this publick Notice

to all the Madmen about this great City, That they may return to their Sen&s;es with all imagi|nable Expedition, le&s;t if they &s;hould come into my Hands, I &s;hould put them into a Regimen which they would not like: for if I find any one of them per&s;i&s;t in his frantick Behaviour, I will make him in a Month's Time as famous as ever <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Porter was.</P>

<P>THere is no Sort of Company &s;o agreeable as that of Women who have good Sen&s;e with|out Affectation, and can conver&s;e with Men without any private De&s;ign of impo&s;ing Chains and Fet|ters. <HI>Belvidera,</HI> whom I vi&s;ited this Evening, is one of the&s;e. There is an invincible Prejudice in Favour of all &s;he &s;ays, from her being a beau|tiful. Woman, becau&s;e &s;he does not con&s;ider her &s;elf as &s;uch when &s;he talks to you. This amiable Temper gives a certain Tincture to all her Di&s;|cour&s;e, and made it very agreeable to me, till we were interrupted by <HI>Lydia,</HI> a Creature who has all the Charms that can adorn a Woman. Her Attractions would indeed be irre&s;i&s;tible, but that &s;he thinks them &s;o, and is always employing them in Stratagems and Conque&s;ts. When I turned my Eye upon her as &s;he &s;at down, I &s;aw &s;he was a Per&s;on of that Character, which, for the further Information of my Country Corre&s;pon|dents, I had long wanted an Opportunity of ex|plaining. <HI>Lydia</HI> is a fini&s;hed <HI>Coquet;</HI> which is a
<PB N="59" REF="66">
Sect among Women of all others the mo&s;t mi&s;|chievous, and makes the greate&s;t Havock and Di&s;order in Society. I went on in the Di&s;|cour&s;e I was in with <HI>Belvidera,</HI> without &s;howing that I had ob&s;erved any Thing extraordinary in <HI>Lydia:</HI> Upon which, I immediately &s;aw her look me over as &s;ome very ill-bred Fellow; and ca&s;ting a &s;cornful Glance on my Dre&s;s, give a Shrug at <HI>Belvidera.</HI> But as much as &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed me, &s;he wanted my Admiration, and made Twenty Of|fers to bring my Eyes her Way: But I reduced her to a Re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s in her Seat, and impertinent playing of her Fan, and many other Motions and Ge&s;tures, before I took the lea&s;t Notice of her. At la&s;t I looked at her with a Kind of Surprize, as if &s;he had before been unob&s;erved by rea&s;on of an ill Light where &s;he &s;ar. It is not to be expre&s;&s;ed what a &s;udden Joy I &s;aw ri&s;e in her Countenance, even at the Approbation of &s;uch a very old Fellow: But &s;he did not long enjoy her Triumph without a Rival; for there imme|diately entred <HI>Ca&s;tabella,</HI> a Lady of a quite con|trary Character, that is to &s;ay, as eminent a <HI>Prude</HI> as <HI>Lydia</HI> is a <HI>Coquet. Belvidera</HI> gave me a Glance, which methought intimated, that they were both Curio&s;ities in their Kind, and worth remarking. As &s;oon as we were again &s;eated, I &s;tole Looks at each Lady, as if I was comparing their Perfe|ctions. <HI>Belvidera</HI> ob&s;erved it, and began to lead me into a Di&s;cour&s;e of them both to their Faces, which is to be done ea&s;ily enough; for one Wo|man is generally &s;o intent upon the Faults of another, that &s;he has not Reflection enough to ob&s;erve when her own are repre&s;ented. I have taken Notice, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI> (&s;aid <HI>Belvidera</HI>), that you have in &s;ome Parts of your Writings drawn Characters of our Sex, in which you have not, to my Apprehen&s;ion, been clear enough and di|&s;tinct, particularly in tho&s;e of a <HI>Prude</HI> and a <HI>Coquet.</HI> Upon the Mention of this, <HI>Lydia</HI> was rouzed with
<PB N="60" REF="67">
the Expectation of &s;eeing <HI>Ca&s;tabella</HI>'s Picture, and <HI>Ca&s;tabella</HI> with the Hopes of that of <HI>Lydia.</HI> Madam (&s;aid I to <HI>Belvidera</HI>), when we con&s;ider Nature, we &s;hall often find very contrary Effects flow from the &s;ame Cau&s;e. The <HI>Prude</HI> and <HI>Coquet</HI> (as different as they appear in their Behaviour) are in Reality the &s;ame Kind of Women: The Motive of Action in both is the Affectation of plea&s;ing Men. They are Si&s;ters of the &s;ame Blood and Con&s;titution, only one chu&s;es a grave, the other a light, Dre&s;s. The <HI>Prude</HI> appears more virtuous, the <HI>Coquet</HI> more vicious, than &s;he really is. The di&s;tant Behaviour of the <HI>Prude,</HI> tends to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e as the Advances of the <HI>Coquet;</HI> and you have as little Rea&s;on to fall into De&s;pair from the Severity of the one, as to con|ceive Hope from the Familiarity of the latter. What leads you into a clear Sen&s;e of their Cha|racter is, That you may ob&s;erve each of them has the Di&s;tinction of Sex in all her Thoughts, Words and Actions. You can never mention any A&s;&s;embly you were lately in, but one asks you with a rigid, the other with a &s;prightly Air, Pray what Men were there? As for <HI>Prudes,</HI> it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that there are &s;everal of them, who, like Hypocrites, by long Practice of a fal&s;e Part, become &s;incere; or at lea&s;t delude them&s;elves in|to a Relief that they are &s;o.</P>
<P>For the Benent of this Society of Ladies, I &s;hall propo&s;e one Rule to them as a Te&s;t of their Virtue. I find in a very celebrated modern Au|thor, That the great Foundre&s;s of the Pieti&s;ts, <HI>Madam de Bourignon,</HI> who was no le&s;s famous for the Sanctity of her Life than for the Singularity of &s;ome of her Opinions, was u&s;ed to boa&s;t, That &s;he had not only the Spirit of Continency in her &s;elf, but that &s;he had al&s;o the Power of commu|nicating it to all who beheld her. This the Scof|fers of tho&s;e Days called, <HI>The Gift of Infrigidation,</HI> and took Occa&s;ion from it to rally her Face, ra|ther
<PB N="61" REF="68">
than admire her Virtue. I would therefore advi&s;e the <HI>Prude,</HI> who has a Mind to know the Integrity of her own Heart, to lay her Hand &s;e|riou&s;ly upon it, and to examine her &s;elf, whether &s;he could &s;incerely rejoice in &s;uch a Gift of con|veying cha&s;t Thoughts to all her Male Beholders. If &s;he has any Aver&s;ion to the Power of In&s;pring &s;o great a Virtue, whatever Notion &s;he may have of her Perfection, &s;he deceives her own Heart, and is &s;till in the State of <HI>Prudery.</HI> Some perhaps will look upon the Boa&s;t of <HI>Madam de Bourignon</HI> as the utmo&s;t O&s;tentation of a <HI>Prude.</HI></P>
<P>If you would &s;ee the Humour of a <HI>Coquet</HI> pu&s;h|ed to the la&s;t Exce&s;s, you may find an In&s;tance of it in the following Story, which I will &s;et down at length, becau&s;e it plea&s;ed me when I read it, though I cannot recollect in what Au|thor.</P>
<P>A young <HI>Coquet</HI> Widow in <HI>France</HI> having been followed by a <HI>Ga&s;con</HI> of Quality, who had boa&s;ted among his Companions of &s;ome Favours which he had never received, to be revenged of him, &s;ent for him one Evening, and told him, It was in his Power to do her a very particular Ser|vice. The <HI>Ga&s;con,</HI> with much Profe&s;&s;ion of his Readine&s;s to obey her Commands, begged to hear in what Manner &s;he de&s;igned to employ him. You know (&s;aid the Widow) my Friend <HI>Belinda,</HI> and mu&s;t often have heard of the Jea|lou&s;y of that impotent Wretch her Husband. Now it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for the carrying on a certain Affair, That his Wife and I &s;hould be together a whole Night. What I have to ask of you is, to dre&s;s your &s;elf in her Night-Clothes, and lie by him a whole Night in her Place, that he may not mi&s;s her while &s;he is with me. The <HI>Ga&s;con</HI> (though of a very lively and undertaking Complexion) began to &s;tartle at the Propo&s;al. Nay, &s;ays the Widow, if you have not the Cou|rage to go through what I ask of you, I mu&s;t
<PB N="62" REF="69">
employ &s;ome Body el&s;e that will. Madam; (&s;ays the <HI>Ga&s;con</HI>) I'll kill him for you if you plea&s;e; but for lying with him!&mdash;How is it po&s;&s;ible to do it without being di&s;covered? If you do not di&s;cover your &s;elf, (&s;ays the Widow) you will lie &s;afe enough, for he is pa&s;t all Curio&s;ity. He comes in at Night while &s;he is a&s;leep, and goes out in a Morning before &s;he awakes, and is in Pain for nothing, &s;o he knows &s;he is there. Ma|dam, (replied the <HI>Ga&s;con</HI>) How can you reward me for pa&s;&s;ing a Night with this old Fellow? The Widow an&s;wered with a Laugh, Perhaps by ad|mitting you to pa&s;s a Night with one you think more agreeable. He took the Hint, put on his Night-Clothes, and had not been a-bed above an Hour before he heard a Knocking at the Door, and the Treading of one who approach'd the other Side of the Bed, and who he did not que&s;tion was the good Man of the Hou&s;e. I do not know, whether the Story would be better by telling you in this Place, or at the End of it, That the Per&s;on who went to Bed to him, was our young <HI>Coquet</HI> Widow. The <HI>Ga&s;con</HI> was in a terrible Fright every Time &s;he moved in the Bed, or turned towards him, and did not fail to &s;hrink from her till he had conveyed him&s;elf to the very Ridge of the Bed. I will not dwell upon the Perplexity he was in the whole Night, which was augmented, when he ob&s;erved that it was now bread Day, and that the Husband did not yet offer to get up and go about his Bu|&s;ine&s;s. All that the <HI>Ga&s;con</HI> had for it, was to keep his Face turned from him, and to feign him&s;elf a&s;leep, when, to his utter Confu&s;ion, the Widow at la&s;t puts out her Arm, and pulls the Bell at her Bed's Head. In came her Friend, and Two or Three Companions to whom the <HI>Ga&s;con</HI> had boa&s;ted of her Favours. The Wi|dow jumped into a Wrapping-Gown, and joined with the re&s;t in laughing at this Man of Intrigue.</P>

<P>THere is no Affection of the Mind &s;o much blen|ded in humane Nature, and wrought into our very Con&s;titution, as Pride. It appears un|der a Multitude of Di&s;gui&s;es, and breaks out in Ten Thou&s;and different Symptoms. Every one feels it in him&s;elf, and yet wonders to &s;ee it in his Neighbour. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I met with an In&s;tance of it the other Day where I &s;hould very little have expected it. Who would believe the proud Per&s;on I am going to &s;peak of, is a Cobler upon <HI>Ludgate-Hill?</HI> This Arti&s;t being naturally a Lover of Re&s;pect, and con&s;idering that his Cir|cum&s;tances are &s;uch that no Man living will give it him, has contrived the Figure of a Beau in Wood, who &s;tands before him in a bending Po|&s;ture, with his Hat under his Left Arm, and his Right Hand extended in &s;uch a Manner as to hold a Thread, a Piece of Wax, or an Awl, according to the particular Service in which his Ma&s;ter thinks fit to employ him. When I &s;aw him, he held a Candle in this ob&s;equious Po&s;ture. I was very well plea&s;ed with the Cobler's Invention, that had &s;o ingeniou&s;ly contrived an Inferior, and &s;tood a little while contemplating this invert|ed Idolatry, wherein the Image did Homage to the Man. When we meet with &s;uch a fanta&s;tick Vanity in one of this Order, it is no Wonder if we may trace it through all Degrees above it,
<PB N="64" REF="71">
and particularly through all the Steps of Great|ne&s;s. We ca&s;ily &s;ee the Ab&s;urdity of Pride when it enters into the Heart of a Cobler; though in Reality it is altogether as ridiculous and unrea&s;o|nable wherever it takes Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an Humane Creature. There is no Temptation to it from the Reflexion upon our Being in general, or upon any Comparative Perfection, whereby one Man may excel another. The greater a Man's Know|ledge is, the greater Motive he may &s;eem to have for Pride; but in the &s;ame Proportion as the one ri&s;es, the other &s;inks, it being the chief Office of Wi&s;dom to di&s;cover to us our Weakne&s;&s;es and Imperfections.</P>
<P>As Folly is the Foundation of Pride, the na|tural Super&s;tructure of it is Madne&s;s. If there was an Occa&s;ion for the Experiment, I would not que&s;tion to make a proud Man a Lunatick in Three Weeks Time, provided I had it in my Power to ripen his Phren&s;y with proper Applica|tions. It is an admirable Reflection in <HI>Terence,</HI> where it is &s;aid of a Para&s;ite, <HI>Hic Homines ex Stul|tis facit In&s;anos. This Fellow</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>has an Art of converting Fools into Madmen.</HI> When I was in <HI>France,</HI> (the Region of Complai&s;ance and Vanity) I have often ob&s;erved, that a great Man who has entered a Levy of Flatterers humble and tempe|rate, has grown &s;o in&s;en&s;ibly heated by the Court, which was paid him on all Sides, that he has been quite di&s;tracted before he could get into his Coach.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ult the Collegiates of <HI>Moorfields,</HI> we &s;hall find mo&s;t of them are beholden to their Pride for their Introduction into that magnificent Palace. I had &s;ome Years ago the Curio&s;ity to enquire into the particular Circum&s;tances of the&s;e whim&s;ical Freeholders, and learned from their own Mouths the Condition and Character of each of them. Indeed I found, that all I &s;poke to were Per&s;ons of Quality. There were at that
<PB N="65" REF="72">
Time Five Dutche&s;&s;es, Three Earls, Two Hea|then Gods, an Emperor, and a Prophet. There were al&s;o a great Number of &s;uch as were locked up from their E&s;tates, and others who concealed their Titles. A Leather-&s;eller of <HI>Taunton</HI> whi&s;|per'd me in my Ear, That he was the Duke of <HI>Monmouth;</HI> but begged me not to betray him. At a little Di&s;tance from him &s;at a Taylor's Wife, who asked me as I went by, if I had &s;een the Sword-bearer? Upon which I pre&s;umed to ask her, Who &s;he was? And was an&s;wered, <HI>My Lady Mayore&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I was very &s;en&s;ibly touched with Compa&s;&s;ion towards the&s;e mi&s;erable People; and indeed, ex|tremely mortified to &s;ee Humane Nature capable of being thus disfigured. However, I reaped this Benefit from it, That I was re&s;olved to guard my &s;elf again&s;t a Pa&s;&s;ion which makes &s;uch Havock in the Brain, and produces &s;o much Di&s;order in the Imagination. For this Rea&s;on, I have endeavoured to keep down the &s;ecret Swel|lings of Re&s;entment, and &s;tifle the very fir&s;t Sug|ge&s;tions of Self-e&s;teem; to e&s;tabli&s;h my Mind in Tranquility, and over-value nothing in my own, or in another's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>For the Benefit of &s;uch who&s;e Heads are a lit|tle turned, though not to &s;o great a Degree as to qualify them for the Place of which I have been now &s;peaking, I &s;hall a&s;&s;ign one of the Sides of the College which I am erecting, for the Cure of this dangerous Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable of the Per&s;ons who&s;e Di|&s;turbance ari&s;es from Pride, and whom I &s;hall u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Diligence to cure, are &s;uch as are hidden in the Appearance of quite contrary Ha|bits and Di&s;po&s;itions. Among &s;uch, I &s;hall in the fir&s;t Place take Care of one who is under the mo&s;t &s;ubtle Species of Pride that I have ob&s;erved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> my whole Experience.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="73">
This Patient is a Per&s;on for whom I have a great Re&s;pect, as being an old Courtier, and a Friend of mine in my Youth. The Man has but a bare Sub&s;i&s;tence, ju&s;t enough to pay his Reckoning with us at the <HI>Trumpet:</HI> But by having &s;pent the Beginning of his Life in the Hearing of great Men and Per&s;ons of Power, he is always promi|&s;ing to do good Offices, to introduce every Man he conver&s;es with into the World; will de&s;ire one of ten Times his Sub&s;tance to let him &s;ee him &s;ometimes, and hints to him, that he does not forget him. He an&s;wers to Matters of no Con&s;equence with great Circum&s;pection; but however, maintains a general Civility in his Words and Actions, and an in&s;olent Benevo|lence to all whom he has to do with: This he practi&s;es with a grave Tone and Air; and tho' I am his Senior by Twelve Years, and richer by Forty Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> he had Ye&s;terday the Impudence to commend me to my Face, and tell me, He &s;hould be always ready to encourage me. In a Word, he is a very in&s;ignificant Fel|low, but exceeding Gracious. The be&s;t Return I can make him for his Favours, is, to carry him my &s;elf to <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and &s;ee him well taken Care of.</P>
<P>The next Per&s;on I &s;hall provide for, is of a quite contrary Character; that has in him all the Stiffne&s;s and In&s;olence of Quality, without a Grain of Sen&s;e or Good Nature to make it either re&s;pected or belov'd. His Pride has infected every Mu&s;cle of his Face; and yet, after all his Endea|vours to &s;how Mankind that he contemns them, he is only neglected by all that &s;ee him, as not of Con&s;equence enough to be hated.</P>
<P>For the Cure of this particular Sort of Mad|ne&s;s, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to break through all Forms with him, and familiarize his Carriage by the U&s;e of a good Cudgel. It may likewi&s;e be of
<PB N="67" REF="74">
great Benefit to make him jump over a Stick half a Dozen Times every Morning.</P>
<P>A Third whom I have in my Eye is a young Fellow, who&s;e Lunacy is &s;uch, that he boa&s;ts of nothing but what he ought to be a&s;hamed of. He is vain of being rotten, and talks publickly of having committed Crimes, which he ought to be hanged for by the Laws of his Country.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal others who&s;e Brains are hurt with Pride, and whom I may hereafter attempt to recover; but &s;hall conclude my pre&s;ent Li&s;t with an old Woman, who is ju&s;t dropping into her Grave, that talks of nothing but her Birth. Tho' &s;he has not a Tooth in her Head, &s;he ex|pects to be valued for the Blood in her Veins, which &s;he fancies is much better than that which glows in the Cheeks of <HI>Belinda,</HI> and &s;ets half the Town on Fire.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU &s;eem in many of your Writings to be a Man of a very compa&s;&s;ionate Temper, and well acquainted with the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love. This encourages me to apply my &s;elf to you in my pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;s, which I believe you will look upon to be very great, and treat with Ten|derne&s;s, notwith&s;tanding it wholly ari&s;es from Love, and that it is a Woman that makes this Confe&s;&s;ion. I am now in the Twenty third Year of my Age, and have for a great while entertained the Addre&s;&s;es of a Man who I thought lov'd me more than Life. I am &s;ure I did him; and mu&s;t own to you, not without &s;ome Confu&s;ion, that I have thought on no|thing el&s;e for the&s;e two long Years, but the happy Life we &s;hould lead together, and the Means I &s;hould u&s;e to make my &s;elf &s;till dearer to him. My Fortune was indeed much beyond his; and as I was always in the Company of my Relations, he was forced to di&s;cover his In|clinations, and declare him&s;elf to me by Stories of other Per&s;ons, kind Looks, and many Ways, which he knew too well that I under&s;tood. Oh! Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible to tell you, how indu&s;trious I have been to make him ap|pear lovely in my Thoughts. I made it a Point of Con&s;cience to think well of him, and of no Man el&s;e: But he has &s;ince had an E&s;tate fallen to him, and makes Love to another of a greater Fortune than mine. I could not believe the Re|port of this at fir&s;t; but about a Fortnight ago I was convinced of the Truth of it by his own

He came to give our Family a formal Vi&s;it, when, as there were &s;everal in Company, and many Things talked of, the Di&s;cour&s;e fell upon &s;ome unhappy Woman who was in my own Circum&s;tances. It was &s;aid by one in the Room, That they could not be|lieve the Story could be true, becau&s;e they did not believe any Man could be &s;o fal&s;e.

<P>WHen my Paper for to Morrow was prepa|red for the Pre&s;s, there came in this Mor|ning a Mail from <HI>Holland,</HI> which brought me &s;e|veral Advices from Foreign Parts, and took my Thoughts off Dome&s;tick Affairs. Among others, I have a Letter from a Burgher of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> who makes me his Compliments, and tells me, he has &s;ent me &s;everal Draughts of Humorous and Satyrical Pictures by the be&s;t Hands of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Nation. They are a trading People, and in their very Minds Mechanicks. They expre&s;s their Wit in Manufacture, as we do in Manu|&s;cript. He informs me, That a very witty Hand has lately repre&s;ented the pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of Pu|blick Affairs in a Landskip, or rather Sea-piece, wherein the Potentates of the Alliance are fi|gured as their Intere&s;ts corre&s;pond with, or af|fect each other, under the Appearance of Com|manders of Ships. The&s;e Ve&s;&s;els carry the Co|lours of the re&s;pective Nations concerned in the pre&s;ent War. The whole De&s;ign &s;eems to tend
<PB N="73" REF="80">
to one Point, which is, That &s;everal Squadrons of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships are battering a <HI>French</HI> Man of War, in order to make her deliver up a Long-Boat with <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colours. My Corre|&s;pondent informs me, That a Man mu&s;t under|&s;tand the Compa&s;s perfectly well, to be able to comprehend the Beauty and Invention of this Piece, which is &s;o skilfully drawn, that the par|ticular Views of every Prince in <HI>Europe,</HI> are &s;een according as the Ships lie to the main Figure in the Picture, and as that Figure may help or re|tard their Sailing. It &s;eems this Curio&s;ity is now on Board a Ship bound for <HI>England,</HI> and with other Rarities made a Pre&s;ent to me. As &s;oon as it arrives, I de&s;ign to expo&s;e it to publick View at my Secretary Mr. <HI>Lillie</HI>'s, who &s;hall have an Explication of all the Terms of Art; and I doubt not but it will give as good Con|tent as the moving Picture in <HI>Fleet-&s;treet.</HI></P>

<P>In Return, I will &s;end you the Secret Hi&s;tory of &s;everal Cardinals, which I have by me in Manu&s;cript, with Gallantries, Amours, Poli|ticks, and Intrigues, by which they made their Way to the Holy Purple.</P>
<P>But when I propo&s;e a Corre&s;pondence, I mu&s;t not tell you what I intend to advi&s;e you of hereafter, and neglect to give you what I have at pre&s;ent. The Pope has been &s;ick for this Fortnight of a violent Tooth-Ach, which has very much rai&s;ed the <HI>French</HI> Faction, and put the Conclave into a great Ferment.

I have known the Time when it u&s;ed to rain Louis-d'Ors on &s;uch Occa&s;ions; but whatever is the Matter, there are very few of them to be &s;een at pre&s;ent at <HI>Rome,</HI> in&s;omuch that it is thought a Man might purcha&s;e Infallibility at a very rea&s;onable Rate. It is neverthele&s;s ho|ped, that his Holine&s;s may recover, and bury the&s;e his imaginary Succe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>There has lately been found an Humane Tooth in a Catecomb, which has engaged a Couple of Convents in a Law-Suit; each of them pretending, That it belong'd to the Jaw-Bone of a Saint who was of their Order. The
<PB N="76" REF="83">
College have &s;ate upon it thrice, and I fine there is a Di&s;po&s;ition among them to take i out of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of both the contending Parties, by rea&s;on of a Speech which was made by one of the Cardinals, who, by rea|&s;on of its being found out of the Company of any other Bones, a&s;&s;erted, That it migh be one of the Teeth which was coughed ou by <HI>Aelia,</HI> an old Woman, who&s;e Lo&s;s is recorded in <HI>Martial.</HI></P>
<P>I have nothing remarkable to communicate to you of State-Affairs, excepting only, that the Pope has lately received an Hor&s;e from the <HI>Ger|man</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, as an Acknowledgment for the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> which is a Fief of the Church.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Sheer-Lane, <DATE>February 6.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Find &s;ome of the mo&s;t polite <HI>Latin</HI> Authors, who wrote at a Time when <HI>Rome</HI> was in its Glory, &s;peak with a certain noble Vanity of the Brightne&s;s and Splendour of the Age in which they lived. <HI>Pliny</HI> often compliments his Emperor <HI>Trajan</HI> upon this Head; and when he would ani|mate him to any Thing great, or di&s;&s;wade him from any Thing that was improper, he in&s;inuates, that it is befitting or unbecoming (the <HI>Claritas &amp; Nitor S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">uli</HI>) that Period of Time which was made illu&s;trious by his Reign. When we ca&s;t our Eyes back on the Hi&s;tory of Mankind, and trace them through their &s;everal Succe&s;&s;ions to their fir&s;t Original, we &s;ometimes &s;ee them break|ing out in great and memorable Actions, and towring up to the utmo&s;t Heights of Virtue and Knowledge; when; perhaps, if we carry our Ob|&s;ervation to a little Di&s;tance, we &s;ee them &s;unk into Sloth and Ignorance, and altogether lo&s;t in Darkne&s;s and Ob&s;curity. Sometimes the whole Species is a&s;leep for Two or Three Generations, and then again awakens into Action, flouri&s;hes in Heroes, Philo&s;ophers, and Poets, who do Ho|nour to humane Nature, and leave &s;uch Tracts of Glory behind them, as di&s;tingui&s;h the Years, in
<PB N="78" REF="85">
which they acted their Part, from the ordinary Cour&s;e of Time.</P>
<P>Methinks a Man cannot, without a &s;ecret Sa|tisfaction, con&s;ider the Glory of the pre&s;ent Age, which will &s;hine as bright as any other in the Hi|&s;tory of Mankind. It is &s;till big with great E|vents, and has already produced Changes and Re|volutions which will be as much admired by Po|&s;terity, as any that have happen'd in the Days of our Fathers, or in the old Times before them. We have &s;een Kingdoms divided and united, Mo|narchs erected and depo&s;ed, Nations transferr'd from one Sovereign to another; Conquerors rai|&s;ed to &s;uch a Greatne&s;s as has given a Terror to <HI>Europe,</HI> and thrown down by &s;uch a Fall, as has moved their Pity.</P>
<P>But it is &s;till a more plea&s;ing View to an <HI>Engli&s;h|man,</HI> to &s;ee his own Country give the chief In|fluence to &s;o illu&s;trious an Age, and &s;tand in the &s;t onge&s;t Point of Light amid&s;t the diffu&s;ed Glory that &s;urrounds it.</P>
<P>If we begin with Learned Men, we may ob|&s;erve, to the Honour of our Country, That tho&s;e who make the greate&s;t Figure in mo&s;t Arts and Sciences, are univer&s;ally allowed to be of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Nation; and what is more remarkable, That Men of the greate&s;t Learning are among the Men of the greate&s;t Quality.</P>
<P>A Nation may indeed abound with Per&s;ons of &s;uch uncommon Parts and Worth, as may make them rather a Misfortune than a Ble&s;&s;ing to the Publick. Tho&s;e who &s;ingly might have been of infinite Advantage to the Age they live in, may, by ri&s;ing up together in the &s;ame Cri&s;is of Time, and by interfering in their Pur&s;uits of Honour, rather interrupt than promote the Service of their Country. Of this we have a famous In&s;tance in the Republick of <HI>Rome,</HI> when <HI>Cae&s;ar, Pompey, Cato, Cicero,</HI> and <HI>Brutus,</HI> endeavoured to recom|mend
<PB N="79" REF="86">
them&s;elves at the &s;ame Time to the Admi|ration of their Contemporaries. Mankind was not able to provide for &s;o many extraordinary Per&s;ons at once, or find out Po&s;ts &s;uitable to their Ambition and Abilities. For this Rea&s;on, they were all as mi&s;erable in their Deaths, as they were famous in their Lives, and occa&s;ioned, not only the Ruin of each other, but al&s;o that of the Commonwealth.</P>
<P>It is therefore a particular Happine&s;s to a Peo|ple, when the Men of &s;uperior Genius and Cha|racter are &s;o ju&s;tly di&s;po&s;ed in the high Places of Honour, that each of them moves in a Sphere which is proper to him, and requires tho&s;e parti|cular Qualities in which he excels.</P>
<P>If I &s;ee a General commanding the Forces of his Country, who&s;e Victories are not to be parallel'd in Story, and who is as famous for his Negotia|tions as his Victories; and at the &s;ame Time &s;ee the Management of a Nation's Trea&s;ury in the Hands of one who has always di&s;tingui&s;h'd him|&s;elf by a generous Contempt of his own private Wealth, and an exact Frugality of that which belongs to the Publick; I cannot but think a People under &s;uch an Admini&s;tration may pro|mi&s;e them&s;elves Conque&s;t abroad, and Plenty at home, If I were to wi&s;h for a proper Per&s;on to pre&s;ide over the Publick Councils, it &s;hould cer|tainly be one as much admir'd for his univer&s;al Knowledge of Men and Things, as for his Elo|quence, Courage and Integrity, in the exerting of &s;uch extraordinary Talents.</P>
<P>Who is not plea&s;ed to &s;ee a Per&s;on in the highe&s;t Station in the Law, who was the mo&s;t eminent in his Profe&s;&s;ion, and the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Orator at the Bar? Or at the Head of the Fleet a Com|mander, under who&s;e Conduct the Common Ene|my received &s;uch a Blow, as he has never been able to recover?</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="87">
Were we to form to our &s;elves the Idea of one whom we &s;hould think proper to govern a di&s;tant Kingdom, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of tho&s;e who differ from us in Religion, and are influenced by foreign Politicks, would it not be &s;uch a one as had &s;ig|nalized him&s;elf by an uniform and un&s;haken Zeal for the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, and by his Dexterity in defeating the Skill and Artifice of its Enemies. In &s;hort, if we find a great Man popular for his Hone&s;ty and Humanity, as well as famed for his Learning and great Skill in all the Languages of <HI>Europe,</HI> or a Per&s;on eminent for tho&s;e Qualifica|tions which make Men &s;hine in publick A&s;&s;em|blies, or for that Steadine&s;s, Con&s;tancy, and good Sen&s;e, which carry a Man to the de&s;ired Point through all the Oppo&s;ition of Tumult and Preju|dice, we have the Happine&s;s to behold them all in Po&s;ts &s;uitable to their Characters.</P>
<P>Such a Con&s;tellation of great Per&s;ons, if I may &s;o &s;peak, while they &s;hine out in their own di|&s;tinct Capacities, reflect a Lu&s;tre upon each other, but in a more particular Manner on their Sove|reign, who has placed them in tho&s;e proper Situa|tions, by which their Virtues become &s;o beneficial to all Her Subjects. It is the Anniver&s;ary of the Birth-day of this Glorious Queen, which naturally led me into this Field of Contemplation, and in|&s;tead of joining in the publick Exultations that are made on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, to entertain my Thoughts with the more &s;erious Plea&s;ure of ruminating upon the Glories of Her Reign.</P>
<P>While I behold Her &s;urrounded with Triumphs, and adorned with all the Pro&s;perity and Succe&s;s which Heaven ever &s;hed on a Mortal, and &s;till con|&s;idering her &s;elf as &s;uch, tho' the Per&s;on appears to me exceedinggreat that has the&s;e ju&s;t Honours paid to her; yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;he appears much great er in that &s;he receives them with &s;uch a glo|rious Humilility, and &s;hows &s;he has no further Re|gard for them, than as they ari&s;e from the&s;e great
<PB N="81" REF="88">
Events which have made her Subjects happy. For my own Part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, when I &s;ee private Virtues in &s;o high a Degree of Perfection, I am not a&s;toni&s;hed at any extraordinary Succe&s;s that attends them, but look upon publick Triumphs as the natural Con&s;equences of religious Retire|ments.</P>

<P>Having received &s;undry Complaints again&s;t the&s;e invi&s;ible Workmen, I ordered the proper Officer of my Court to ferret them out of their re&s;pective Caves, and bring them before me, which was Ye|&s;terday executed accordingly.</P>

The Per&s;on who appeared again&s;t them was a Merchant, who had by him a great Magazine of Wines that he had laid in before the War: But the&s;e Gentlemen (as he &s;aid) had &s;o vitiated the Nation's Palate, that no Man could believe his to be <HI>French,</HI> becau&s;e it did not ta&s;t like what they &s;old for &s;uch. As a Man never pleads better than where his own Per&s;onal Intere&s;t is concern'd, he exhibited to the Court with great Eloquence, That this new Corporation of Druggi&s;ts had inflamed the Bills of Mortality, and puzzled the College of Phy&s;icians with Di&s;ea&s;es, for which they neither knew a Name or Cure. He accu&s;ed &s;ome of gi|ving all their Cu&s;tomers Colicks and Megrims; and mentioned one who had boa&s;ted, he had a Tun of Claret by him, that in a Fortnight's Time &s;hould give the Gout to a Dozen of the healthful|e&s;t Men in the City, provided that their Con&s;titu|tions were prepared for it by Wealth and Idlene&s;s. He then enlarged, with a great Show of Rea&s;on, upon the Prejudice which the&s;e Mixtures and Compo&s;itions had done to the Brains of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Nation; as is too vi&s;ible (&s;aid he) from many late Pamphlets, Speeches and Sermons, as well as from the ordinary Conver&s;ations of the Youth of this Age. He then quoted an ingenious Per&s;on, who would undertake to know by a Man's Wri|tings, the Wine he mo&s;t delighted in; and on that Occa&s;ion named a certain Satyri&s;t, whom he had di&s;covered to be the Author of a Lampoon, by the manife&s;t Ta&s;t of the Sloe, which &s;how'd it &s;elf in it by much Roughne&s;s, and little Spirit.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t Place, he a&s;cribed to the unnatural Tumults and Fermentations which the&s;e Mixtures rai&s;e in our Blood; the Divi&s;ions, Heats and Ani|mo&s;ities, that reign among us; and in particular, a&s;&s;erted mo&s;t of the modern Enthu&s;ia&s;ms and Agitations to be nothing el&s;e but the Effects of adulterated <HI>Port.</HI></P>

The Council for the Brewers had a Face &s;o ex|tremely inflamed and illuminated with Carbun|cles, that I did not wonder to &s;ee him an Advo|cate for the&s;e Sophi&s;tications. His Rhetorick was likewi&s;e &s;uch as I &s;hould have expected from the common Draught, which I found he often drank to a great Exce&s;s. Indeed, I was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed at his Figure and Parts, that I ordered him to give me a Ta&s;t of his u&s;ual Liquor; which I had no &s;ooner drank, but I found a Pimple ri&s;ing in my F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ehead; and felt &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible Decay in my Under&s;tanding, that I would not proceed in the Trial till the Fume of it was entirely di&s;&s;ipa|ted.</P>
<P>This notable Advocate had little to &s;ay in the Defence of his C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ents, but that they were under a Nece&s;&s;ity of making Claret if they would keep open their Doors, it being the Nature of Man|kind to love every Thing that is prohibited. He further pretended to rea&s;on, That it might be as profitable to the Nation to make <HI>French</HI> Wine as <HI>French</HI> Hats; and concluded with the great Ad|vantage that this had already brought to Part of the Kingdom. Upon which he informed the Court, That the Lands in <HI>Hereford&s;hire</HI> were rai|&s;ed Two Years Purcha&s;e &s;ince the Beginning of the War.</P>
<P>When I had &s;ent out my Summons to the&s;e Peo|ple, I gave at the &s;ame Time Orders to each of them to bring the &s;everal Ingredients he made u&s;e of in di&s;tinct Phials, which they had done ac|cordingly, and ranged them into two Rows on each Side of the Court. The Workmen were drawn up in Ranks behind them. The Merchant informed me, That in one Row of Phials were the &s;everal Colours they dealt in, and in the other the Ta&s;ts. He then &s;howed me on the Right Hand one who went by the Name of <HI>Tom. Tintoret,</HI> who (as he told me) was the greate&s;t Ma&s;ter in his Colouring of any Vintner in <HI>London.</HI> To give me
<PB N="85" REF="92">
a Proof of his Art, he took a Gla&s;s of fair Water; and by the Infu&s;ion of Three Drops out of one of his Phials, converted it into a mo&s;t beautiful pale <HI>Burgundy.</HI> Two more of the &s;ame Kind heighten|ed it into a perfect <HI>Languedoc:</HI> From thence it pa&s;|&s;ed into a florid <HI>Hermitage:</HI> And after having gone through Two or Three other Changes, by the Ad|dition of a &s;ingle Drop, ended in a very deep <HI>Pontack.</HI> This ingenious Vertuo&s;o &s;eeing me very much &s;urpri&s;ed at his Art, told me, That he had not an Opportunity of &s;howing it in Perfection, having only made u&s;e of Water for the Ground-Work of his Colouring: But that if I were to &s;ee an Operation upon Liquors of &s;tronger Bodies, the Art would appear to a much greater Advan|tage. He added, That he doubted not but it would plea&s;e my Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Cyder of one Apple take only a Vermilion, when another, with a le&s;s Quantity of the &s;ame Infu&s;ion, would ri&s;e into a dark Purple, according to the different Texture of Parts in the Liquor. He informed me al&s;o, That he could hit the different Shades and Degrees of Red, as they appear in the Pink and the Ro&s;e, the Clove and the Carnation, as he had <HI>Rheni&s;h</HI> or <HI>Mo&s;elle, Perry</HI> or <HI>White Port,</HI> to work in.</P>
<P>I was &s;o &s;atisfied with the Ingenuity of this Vertuo&s;o, that, after having advi&s;ed him to quit &s;o di&s;hone&s;t a Profe&s;&s;ion, I promi&s;ed him, in Con|&s;ideration of his great Genius, to recommend him as a Partner to a Friend of mine, who has heaped up great Riches, and is a Scarlet Dyer.</P>
<P>The Arti&s;ts on my other Hand were ordered in the Second Place to make &s;ome Experiments of their Skill before me: Upon which the famous <HI>Harry Sippet</HI> &s;tept out, and asked me, What I would be plea&s;ed to drink? At the &s;ame Time he filled out Three or Four white Liquors in a Gla&s;s, and told me, That it &s;hould be what I plea&s;ed to tall for; adding very learnedly, That the Liquor
<PB N="86" REF="93">
before him was as the naked Sub&s;tance or Fir&s;t Matter of his Compound, to which he and his Friend; who &s;tood over-again&s;t him, could give what Accidents or Form they plea&s;ed. Finding him &s;o great a Philo&s;opher, I de&s;ired he would convey into it the Qualities and E&s;&s;ence of right <HI>Bourdeaux.</HI> Coming, coming, Sir, (&s;aid he) with the Air of a Drawer; and after having ca&s;t his Eye on the &s;everal Ta&s;ts and Flavours that &s;tood before him, he took up a little Cruit that was filled with a kind of Inky Juice, and pour|ing &s;ome of it out into the Gla&s;s of White-Wine, pre&s;ented it to me, and told me, This was the Wine over which mo&s;t of the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the la&s;t Term had been di&s;patched. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I looked upon that &s;ooty Drug which he held up in his Cruit as the Quinte&s;&s;ence of <HI>Engli&s;h Bour|deaux,</HI> and therefore de&s;ired him to give me a Gla&s;s of it by it &s;elf, which he did with great Un|willingne&s;s. My Cat at that Time &s;at by me upon the Elbow of my Chair; and as I did not care for making the Experiment upon my &s;elf, I reached it to her to &s;ip of it, which had like to have co&s;t her her Life; for notwith&s;tanding it flung her at fir&s;t into freaki&s;h Tricks, quite con|trary to her u&s;ual Gravity, in le&s;s than a quarter of an Hour &s;he fell into Convul&s;ions; and had it not been a Creature more tenacious of Life than any other, would certainly have died under the Operation.</P>
<P>I was &s;o incen&s;ed by the Tortures of my inno|cent Dome&s;tick, and the unworthy Dealings of the&s;e Men, that I told them, if each of them had as many Lives as the injured Creature before them, they de&s;erved to forfeit them for the per|nicious Arts which they u&s;ed for their Profit. I therefore bid them look upon them&s;elves as no better than as a kind of A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins and Murderers within the Law. However, &s;ince they had dealt &s;o clearly with me, and laid before me their

<P>For my own Part, I have re&s;olved hereafter to be very careful in my Liquors, and have agreed with a Friend of mine in the Army, upon their next March, to &s;ecure me Two Hog&s;heads of the be&s;t Stomach Wine in the Cellars of <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> for the good of my Lucubrations, and the Comfort of my old Age.</P>

<P>AFter having applied my Mind with more than ordinary Attention to my Studies, it is my u&s;ual Cu&s;tom to relax and unbend it in the Conver&s;ation of &s;uch as are rather ea&s;y than &s;hi|ning Companions. This I find particularly ne|ce&s;&s;ary for me before I retire to Re&s;t, in order to draw my Slumbers upon me by Degrees, and fall a&s;leep in&s;en&s;ibly. This is the particular U&s;e I make of a Set of heavy hone&s;t Men, with whom I have pa&s;&s;ed many Hours with much Indolence, though not with great Plea&s;ure. Their Conver|&s;ation is a kind of Preparative for Sleep: It takes the Mind down from its Ab&s;tractions, leads it in|to the familiar Traces of Thought, and lulls it into
<PB N="88" REF="95">
that State of Tranquility, which is the Condition of a thinking Man when he is but half awake. After this, my Reader will not be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear the Account which I am about to give of a Club of my own Contemporaries, among whom I pa&s;s Two or Three Hours every Evening. This I look upon as taking my fir&s;t Nap before I go to Bed. The Truth of it is, I &s;hould think my &s;elf unju&s;t to Po&s;terity, as well as to the Society at the <HI>Trumpet,</HI> of which I am a Member, did not I in &s;ome Part of my Writings give an Account of the Per&s;ons among whom I have pa&s;&s;ed almo&s;t a Sixth Part of my Time for the&s;e la&s;t Forty Years. Our Club con&s;i&s;ted originally of Fifteen; but partly by the Severity of the Law in arbitrary Times, and partly by the natural Effects of old Age, we are at pre&s;ent reduced to a Third Part of that Number: In which however we have this Con&s;olation, That the be&s;t Company is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of Five Per&s;ons. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, be&s;ides the aforementioned Benefit which I meet with in the Conver&s;ation of this &s;elect Society, I am not the le&s;s plea&s;ed with the Company, in that I find my &s;elf the greate&s;t Wit among them, and am heard as their Oracle in all Points of Learning and Difficulty.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Jeoffrey Notch,</HI> who is the olde&s;t of the Club, has been in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Right Hand Chair Time out of Mind, and is the only Man among us that has the Liberty of &s;tirring the Fire. This our Foreman is a Gentleman of an ancient Family, that came to a great E&s;tate &s;ome Years before he had Di&s;cretion, and run it out in Hounds, Hor|&s;es, and Cock-fighting; for which Rea&s;on he looks upon him&s;elf as an hone&s;t worthy Gentle|man who has had Misfortunes in the World, and calls every thriving Man a pitiful Up&s;tart.</P>
<P>Major <HI>Matchlock</HI> is the next Senior, who &s;erved in the la&s;t Civil Wars, and has all the Battles by Heart. He does not think any Action in <HI>Europe</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="96">
worth talking of &s;ince the Fight of <HI>Mar&s;ton-Moor;</HI> and every Night tells us of his having been knock'd off his Hor&s;e at the Ri&s;ing of the <HI>London</HI> 'Prentices; for which he is in great E&s;teem among&s;t us.</P>
<P>Hone&s;t old <HI>Dick Reptile</HI> is the Third of our So|ciety: He is a good natured indolent Man, who &s;peaks little him&s;elf, but laughs at our Jokes, and brings his young Nephew along with him, a Youth of Eighteen Years old, to &s;how him good Company, and give him a Ta&s;t of the World. This young Fellow &s;its generally &s;ilent; but when|ever he opens his Mouth, or laughs at any Thing that pa&s;&s;es, he is con&s;tantly told by his Uncle, after a jocular Manner, <Q REND="inline">"Ay, ay, <HI>Jack,</HI> you young Men think us Fools; but we old Men know you are.'</Q></P>
<P>The greate&s;t Wit of our Company, next to my &s;elf, is a Bencher of the neighbouring Inn, who in his Youth frequented the Ordinaries about <HI>Cha|ring-Cro&s;s,</HI> and pretends to have been intimate with <HI>Jack Ogle.</HI> He has about Ten Di&s;tichs of <HI>Hudibras</HI> without Book, and never leaves the Club till he has applied them all. If any modern Wit be mentioned, or any Town Frolick &s;poken of, he &s;hakes his Head at the Dulne&s;s of the pre|&s;ent Age, and tells us a Story of <HI>Jack Ogle.</HI></P>
<P>For my own Part, I am e&s;teemed among them, becau&s;e they &s;ee I am &s;omething re&s;pected by others, though at the &s;ame Time I under&s;tand by their Behaviour, that I am con&s;idered by them as a Man of a great deal of Learning, but no Know|ledge of the World; in&s;omuch that the Major &s;ometimes, in the Height of his Military Pride, calls me the Philo&s;opher: And Sir <HI>Jeoffrey</HI> no lon|ger ago than la&s;t Night, upon a Di&s;pute what Day of the Month it was then in <HI>Holland,</HI> pulled his Pipe out of his Mouth, and cried, What does the Scholar &s;ay to it?</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="97">
Our Club meets preci&s;ely at Six a Clock in the Evening; but I did not come la&s;t Night till Half an Hour after Seven, by which Means I e&s;caped the Battle of <HI>Na&s;eby,</HI> which the Major u&s;ually be|gins at about Three Quarters after Six; I found al&s;o, That my good Friend, the Bencher, had al|ready &s;pent Three of his Di&s;tichs, and only wait|ing an Opportunity to hear a Sermon &s;poken of, that he might introduce the Couplet where <HI>a-Stick</HI> rhimes to <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tick.</HI> At my Entrance in|to the Room, they were naming a red Petticoat and a Cloak, by which I found that the Ben|cher had been diverting them with a Story of <HI>Jack Ogle.</HI></P>
<P>I had no &s;ooner taken my Seat, but Sir <HI>Jeoffrey,</HI> to &s;how his good Will towards me, gave me a Pipe of his own Tobacco, and &s;tirred up the Fire. I lock upon it as a Point of Morality, to be obliged by tho&s;e who endeavour to oblige me; and there|fore in Requital for his Kindne&s;s, and to &s;et the Conver&s;ation a going, I took the be&s;t Occa&s;ion I could, to put him upon telling us the Story of old <HI>Gantlett,</HI> which he always does with very parti|cular Concern. He traced up his De&s;cent on both Sides for &s;everal Generations, de&s;cribing his Diet and Manner of Life, with his &s;everal Battles, and particularly that in which he fell. This <HI>Gantlett</HI> was a Game-Cock, upon who&s;e Head the Knight in his Youth had won Five Hundred Pounds, and lo&s;t Two Thou&s;and. This naturally &s;et the Major upon the Account of <HI>Edge-hill</HI> Fight, and ended in a Duel of <HI>Jack Ogle</HI>'s</P>
<P>Old <HI>Reptile</HI> was extremely attentive to all that was &s;aid, tho' it was the &s;ame he had heard every Night for the&s;e Twenty Years, and upon all Oc|ca&s;ions, winked upon his Nephew to mind what pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This may &s;uffice to give the World a Ta&s;t of our innocent Conver&s;ation, which we &s;pun out till about Ten of the Clock, when my Maid came
<PB N="91" REF="98">
with a Lanthorn to light me Home. I could not but reflect with my &s;elf as I was going out upon the talkative Humour of old Men, and the little Figure which that Part of Life makes in one who cannot employ this natural Propen&s;ity in Di&s;cour|&s;es which would make him venerable. I mu&s;t own, it makes me very melancholy in Company, when I hear a young Man begin a Story; and have often ob&s;erv'd, That one of a Quarter of an Hour long in a Man of Five and twenty, gathers Circum&s;tances every Time he tells it, till it grows into a long <HI>Canterbury</HI> Tale of two Hours by that Time he is Three&s;core.</P>
<P>The only Way of avoiding &s;uch a trifling and frivolous old Age, is, to lay up in our Way to it &s;uch Stores of Knowledge and Ob&s;ervation as may make us u&s;eful and agreeable in our declining Years. The Mind of Man in a long Life will become a Magazine of Wi&s;dom or Folly, and will con&s;equently di&s;charge it &s;elf in &s;omething im|pertinent or improving. For which Rea&s;on, as there is nothing more ridiculous than an old tri|fling Story-Teller, &s;o there is nothing more vene|rable than one who has turned his Experience to the Entertainment and Advantage of Mankind.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we who are in the la&s;t Stage of Life, and are apt to indulge our &s;elves in Talk, ought to con&s;ider, if what we &s;peak be worth being heard, and endeavour to make our Di&s;cour&s;e like that of <HI>Na&s;tor,</HI> which Homer compares to the Flowing of Honey for its Sweetne&s;s.</P>
<P>I am afraid I &s;hall be thought guilty of this Exce&s;s I am &s;peaking of, when I cannot conclude without ob&s;erving, that <HI>Milton</HI> certainly thought of this Pa&s;&s;age in Homer when in his De&s;cription of an eloquent Spirit, he &s;ays, <HI>His Tongue drop'd Manna.</HI></P>

<P>SIlence is &s;ometimes more &s;ignificant and &s;u|blime than the mo&s;t noble and mo&s;t expre&s;|&s;ive Eloquence, and is on many Occa&s;ions the In|dication of a great Mind. Several Authors have treated of Silence as a Part of Duty and Di&s;cre|tion, but none of them have con&s;idered it in this Light. Homer compares the Noi&s;e and Clamour of the <HI>Trojans</HI> advancing towards the Enemy, to the Cackling of Cranes when they invade an Army of Pigmies. On the contrary, he makes his Countrymen and Favourites, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> move forward in a regular determined March, and in the Depth of Silence. I find in the Accounts which are given us of &s;ome of the more <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> Nations, where the Inhabitants are di&s;po&s;ed by their Con&s;titutions and Climates to higher Strains of Thought, and more elevated Raptures than what we feel in the <HI>Northern</HI> Regions of the World, That Silence is a Religious Exerci&s;e among them. For when their publick Devotions are in the greate&s;t Fervour, and their Hearts lifted up as high as Words can rai&s;e them, there are cer|tain Su&s;pen&s;ions of Sound and Motion for a Time, in which the Mind is left to it &s;elf, and &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;well with &s;uch &s;ecret Conceptions as are too big for Utterance. I have my &s;elf been wonder|fully delighted with a Ma&s;ter-piece of Mu&s;ick, when in the very Tumult and Ferment of their Harmony, all the Voices and In&s;truments have
<PB N="93" REF="100">
&s;topped &s;hort on a &s;udden, and after a little Pau&s;e recovered them&s;elves again as it were, and renew|ed the Concert in all its Parts. Methoughts this &s;hort Interval of Silence has had more Mufick in it than any the &s;ame Space of Time before or af|ter it. There are Two In&s;tances of Silence in the Two greate&s;t Poets that ever wrote, which have &s;omething in them as &s;ublime as any of the Speeches in their whole Works. The Fir&s;t is that of <HI>Ajax,</HI> in the Eleventh Book of the <HI>Ody&s;|&s;y. Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> who had been the Rival of this great Man in his Life, as well as the Occa&s;ion of his Death, upon meeting his Shade in the Region of departed Heroes, makes his Submi&s;&s;ion to him with an Humility next to Adoration, which the other pa&s;&s;es over with dumb &s;ullen Maje&s;ty, and &s;uch a Silence, as (to u&s;e the Words of <HI>Longinus</HI>) had more Greatne&s;s in it than any Thing he could have &s;poken.</P>
<P>The next In&s;tance I &s;hall mention is in <HI>Virgil,</HI> where the Poet, doubtle&s;s, imitates this Silence of <HI>Ajax</HI> in that of <HI>Dido;</HI> though I do not know that any of his Commentators have taken Notice of it. <HI>Aeneas</HI> finding among the Shades of de|&s;pairing Lovers, the Gho&s;t of her who had lately died for him, with the Wound &s;till fre&s;h upon her, addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to her with expanded Arms, Floods of Tears, and the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Profe&s;|&s;ions of his own Innocence as to what had hap|pen'd; all which <HI>Dido</HI> receives with the Dignity and Di&s;dain of a re&s;enting Lover, and an injured Queen; and is &s;o far from vouch&s;afing him an An&s;wer, that &s;he does not give him a &s;ingle Look. The Poet repre&s;ents her as turning away her Face from him while he &s;poke to her; and after ha|ving kept her Eyes for &s;ome Time upon the Ground, as one that heard and contemned his Prote&s;tations, flying from him into the Grove of Myrtle, and into the Arms of another, who&s;e Fi|delity had de&s;erved her Love.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="101">
I have often thought our Writers of Tragedy have been very defective in this Particular, and that they might have given great Beauty to their Works, by certain Stops and Pau&s;es in the Re|pre&s;entation of &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ions, as it is not in the Power of Language to expre&s;s. There is &s;ome|thing like this in the la&s;t Act of <HI>Venice Pre&s;erv'd,</HI> where <HI>Pierre</HI> is brought to an infamous Execu|tion, and begs of his Friend, as a Reparation for pa&s;t Injuries, and the only Favour he could do him, to re&s;cue him from the Ignominy of the Wheel by &s;tabbing him. As he is going to make this dreadful Reque&s;t, he is not able to commu|nicate it, but withdraws his Face from his Friend's Ear, and bur&s;ts into Tears. The melan|choly Silence that follows hereupon, and conti|nues till he has recovered him&s;elf enough to re|veal his Mind to his Friend, rai&s;es in the Specta|tors a Grief that is inexpre&s;&s;ible, and an Idea of &s;uch a complicated Di&s;tre&s;s in the Actor, as Words cannot utter. It would look as ridiculous to many Readers to give Rules and Directions for proper Silences, as for <HI>Penning a Whi&s;per:</HI> But it is certain, that in the Extremity of mo&s;t Pa&s;&s;ions, particularly Surpri&s;e, Admiration, A&s;toni&s;hment, nay, Rage it &s;elf; there is nothing more graceful than to &s;ee the Play &s;tand &s;till for a few Moments, and the Audience fixed in an agreeable Su&s;pence, during the Silence of a skilful Actor.</P>
<P>But Silence never &s;hows it &s;elf to &s;o great an Advantage, as when it is made the Reply to Ca|lumny and Defamation, provided that we give no ju&s;t Occa&s;ion for them. We might produce an Example of it in the Behaviour of one in whom it appeared in all its Maje&s;ty, and one, who&s;e Si|lence, as well as his Per&s;on, was altogether Di|vine. When one con&s;iders this Subject only in its Sublimity, this great In&s;tance could not but occur to me; and &s;ince I only make U&s;e of it to &s;how the highe&s;t Example of it, I hope I do not offend

To forbear replying to an unju&s;t Reproach, and overlook it with a generous, or (if po&s;&s;ible) with an entire Neglect of it, is one of the mo&s;t heroick Acts of a great Mind: And I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, when I reflect upon the Behaviour of &s;ome of the greate&s;t Men in Antiquity, I do not &s;o much admire them that they de&s;erved the Prai&s;e of the whole Age they lived in, as becau&s;e they con|temned the Envy and Detraction of it.</P>

<P>I WAS awakened very early this Morning by the di&s;tant Crowing of a Cock, which I thought had the fine&s;t Pipe I ever heard.

Upon Delivery of this Petition, the worthy Gentleman who pre&s;ented it, told me the Cu|&s;toms of many wi&s;e Nations of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> through which he had travelled; That nothing was more frequent than to &s;ee a Dervees lay out a whole Year's Income in the Redemption of Larks or Linets that had unhappily fallen into the Hands of Bird-Catchers: That it was al&s;o u&s;ual to run between a Dog and a Bull to keep them from hurting one another, or to lo&s;e the U&s;e of a Limb in parting a Couple of furious Ma&s;tiffs. He then in&s;i&s;ted upon the Ingratitude and Di&s;in|genuity of treating in this Manner a nece&s;&s;ary and Dome&s;tick Animal, that has made the whole Hou&s;e keep good Hours, and called up the Cook-Maid for five Years together. What would a <HI>Turk</HI> &s;ay, continued he, &s;hould he hear, that it is a common Entertainment in a Nation which pretends to be one of the mo&s;t ci|vilized of <HI>Europe,</HI> to tie an innocent Animal to a Stake, and put him to an ignominious Death, who has perhaps been the Guardian and Prove|ditor of a poor Family, as long as he was able to get Eggs for his Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I thought what this Gentleman &s;aid was very rea&s;onable; and have often wondered, that we do not lay a&s;ide a Cu&s;tom which makes us appear barbarous to Nations much more rude and unpo|li&s;hed than our &s;elves. Some <HI>French</HI> Writers have repre&s;ented this Diver&s;ion of the common People much to our Di&s;advantage, and imputed it to natural Fiercene&s;s and Cruelty of Temper; as they do &s;ome other Entertainments peculiar to our Nation: I mean tho&s;e elegant Diver&s;ions of Bull-baiting and Prize-fighting, with the like ingenious Recreations of the Bear-Garden. I wi&s;h I knew how to an&s;wer this Reproach which is ca&s;t upon us, and excu&s;e the Death of &s;o many innocent Cocks, Bulls, Dogs, and
<PB N="100" REF="107">
Bears, as have been &s;et together by the Ears, or died untimely Deaths, only to make us Sport.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid, That the&s;e are the Entertain|ments of common People. It is true; but they are the Entertainments of no other common People. Be&s;ides, I am afraid there is a Tincture of the &s;ame &s;avage Spirit in the Diver&s;ions of tho&s;e of higher Rank, and more refined Reli&s;h. <HI>Rapine</HI> ob&s;erves, That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Theatre very much delights in Blood&s;hed, which he likewi&s;e repre&s;ents as an Indication of our Tempers. I mu&s;t own, there is &s;omething very horrid in the publick Executions of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tragedy. Stab|bing and Poi&s;oning, which are performed behind the Scenes in other Nations, mu&s;t be done openly among us, to gratify the Audience.</P>
<P>When poor <HI>Sandford</HI> was upon the Stage, I have &s;een him groaning upon a Wheel, &s;tuck with Daggers, impaled alive, calling his Execu|tioners, with a dying Voice, Cruel Dogs and Villains! And all this to plea&s;e his judicious Spectators, who were wonderfully delighted with &s;eeing a Man in Torment &s;o well acted. The Truth of it is, the Politene&s;s of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage, in Regard to <HI>Decorum,</HI> is very extraordinary. We act Murders to &s;how our Intrepidity, and Adulteries to &s;how our Gallantry: Both of them are frequent in our mo&s;t taking Plays, with this Difference only, That the Fir&s;t are done in the Sight of the Audience, and the other wrought up to &s;uch an Height upon the Stage, that they are almo&s;t put in Execution before the Actors can get behind the Scenes.</P>
<P>I would not have it thought, that there is ju&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ground for tho&s;e Con&s;equences which our Ene|mies draw again&s;t us from the&s;e Practi&s;es; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> methinks one would be &s;orry for any Manner o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Occa&s;ion for &s;uch Mi&s;repre&s;entations of us.

<P>SEveral Letters which I have lately received give me Information, That &s;ome well-di&s;|po&s;ed Per&s;ons have taken Offence at my u&s;ing the Word Free-Thinker as a Term of Reproach. To &s;et therefore this Matter in a clear Light, I mu&s;t declare, That no one can have a greater Veneration than my &s;elf for the Free-Thinkers of Antiquity, who acted the &s;ame Part in tho&s;e Times, as the great Men of the Reformation did in &s;everal Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> by exerting them|&s;elves
<PB N="102" REF="109">
again&s;t the Idolatry and Super&s;tition of the Times in which they lived. It was by this noble Impul&s;e that <HI>Socrates</HI> and his Di&s;ciples, as well as all the Philo&s;ophers of Note in <HI>Greece,</HI> and <HI>Cicero, Seneca,</HI> with all the Learned Men of <HI>Rome,</HI> endeavoured to enlighten their Contem|poraries amid&s;t the Darkne&s;s and Ignorance in which the World was then &s;unk and buried. The great Points which the&s;e Free-Thinkers en|deavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h and inculcate into the Minds of Men, was, the Formation of the Uni|ver&s;e, the Superintendency of Providence, the Perfection of the Divine Nature, the Immorta|lity of the Soul, and the future State of Rewards and Puni&s;hments. They all complied with the Religion of their Country, as much as po&s;&s;ible, in &s;uch Particulars as did not contradict and per|vert the&s;e great and fundamental Doctrines of Mankind. On the contrary, the Per&s;ons who now &s;et up for Free-Thinkers, are &s;uch as endea|vour by a little Tra&s;h of Words and Sophi&s;try, to weaken and de&s;troy tho&s;e very Principles, for the Vindication of which, Freedom of Thought at fir&s;t became laudable and heroick. The&s;e Apo&s;tates, from Rea&s;on and good Sen&s;e, can look at the glorious Frame of Nature, with|out paying an Adoration to him that rai&s;ed it; can con&s;ider the great Revolutions in the Univer&s;e, without lifting up their Minds to that Superior Power which hath the Direction of it; can pre&s;ume to cen&s;ure the Deity in his Ways to|wards Men; can level Mankind with the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h; can extingui&s;h in their own Minds all the plea&s;ing Hopes of a future State, and lull them&s;elves into a &s;tupid Security again&s;t the Terrors of it. If one were to take the Word Prie&s;tcraft out of the Mouths of the&s;e &s;hallow Mon&s;ters, they would be immediately &s;truck dumb. It is by the Help of this &s;ingle Term that they endeavour to di&s;appoint the good
<PB N="103" REF="110">
Works of the mo&s;t Learned and Venerable Order of Men, and harden the Hearts of the Igno|rant again&s;t the very Light of Nature, and the common received Notions of Mankind. We ought not to treat &s;uch Mi&s;creants as the&s;e upon the Foot of fair Di&s;putants, but to pour out Con|tempt upon them, and &s;peak of them with Scorn and Infamy, as the Pe&s;ts of Society, the Revilers of Humane Nature, and the Bla&s;phemers of a Being, whom a good Man would rather die than hear di&s;honoured. <HI>Cicero,</HI> after having men|tioned the great Heroes of Knowledge that re|commended this Divine Doctrine of the Immor|tality of the Soul, calls tho&s;e &s;mall Pretenders to Wi&s;dom who declared again&s;t it, certain <HI>Minute</HI> Philo&s;ophers, u&s;ing a Diminutive even of the Word Little, to expre&s;s the de&s;picable Opinion he had of them. The Contempt he throws up|on them in another Pa&s;&s;age is yet more remarka|ble, where, to &s;how the mean Thoughts he entertains of them, he declares, he would rather be in the Wrong with <HI>Plato,</HI> than in the Right with &s;uch Company. There is indeed nothing in the World &s;o ridiculous as one of the&s;e grave Philo&s;ophical Free-Thinkers, that hath neither Pa&s;&s;ions nor Appetites to gratify, no Heats of Blood nor Vigour of Con&s;titution that can turn his Sy&s;tems of Infidelity to his Advantage, or rai&s;e Plea&s;ures out of them which are incon|&s;i&s;tent with the Belief of an Hereafter. One that has neither Wit, Gallantry, Mirth, or Youth, to indulge by the&s;e Notions, but only a poor, joyle&s;s uncomfortable Vanity of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing him&s;elf from the re&s;t of Mankind, is rather to be regarded as a Mi&s;chievous Luna|tick, than a mi&s;taken Philo&s;opher. A cha&s;t In|fidel, a &s;peculative Libertine, is an Animal that I &s;hould not believe to be in Nature, did I not &s;ometimes meet with this Species of Men, that plead for the Indulgence of their Pa&s;&s;ions in the
<PB N="104" REF="111">
mid&s;t of a &s;evere &s;tudious Life, and talk a|gain&s;t the Immortality of the Soul over a Di&s;h of Coffee.</P>
<P>I would fain ask a <HI>Minute</HI> Philo&s;opher, What Good he propo&s;es to Mankind by the publi&s;hing of his Doctrines? Will they make a Man a bet|ter Citizen, or Father of a Family; a more en|dearing Husband, Friend, or Son? Will they en|large his publick or private Virtues, or correct any of his Frailties or Vices? What is there ei|ther joyful or glorious in &s;uch Opinions? Do they either refre&s;h or enlarge our Thoughts? Do they contribute to the Happine&s;s, or rai&s;e the Dignity of Humane Nature? The only Good that I have ever heard pretended to, is, That they bani&s;h Terrors, and &s;et the Mind at Ea&s;e. But who&s;e Terrors do they bani&s;h? It is certain, if there were any Strength in their Arguments, they would give great Di&s;turbance to Minds that are influenc'd by Virtue, Honour, and Mora|lity, and take from us the only Comforts and Supports of Affliction, Sickne&s;s, and Old Age. The Minds therefore which they &s;et at Ea&s;e, are only tho&s;e of impenitent Criminals and Male|factors, and which, to the Good of Mankind, &s;hould be in perpetual Terror and Alarm.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, nothing is more u&s;ual than for a Free-Thinker, in Proportion as the In&s;olence of Sceptici&s;m is abated in him by Years and Know|ledge, or humbled and beaten down by Sorrow or Sickne&s;s, to reconcile him&s;elf to the general Conceptions of rea&s;onable Creatures; &s;o that we frequently &s;ee the Apo&s;tates turning from their Revolt toward the End of their Lives, and employing the Refu&s;e of their Parts in promoting tho&s;e Truths which they had before endeavoured to invalidate.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of a Gentleman in <HI>France</HI> is very well known, who was &s;o zealous a Promoter of
<PB N="105" REF="112">
Infidelity, that he had got together a &s;elect Com|pany of Di&s;ciples, and travelled into all Parts of the Kingdom to make Converts. In the Mid&s;t of his fanta&s;tical Succe&s;s he fell &s;ick, and was reclaimed to &s;uch a Sen&s;e of his Condition, that after he had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome Time in great Agonies and Horrors of Mind, he begged tho&s;e who had the Care of burying him, to dre&s;s his Body in the Habit of a Capuchin, that the Devil might not run away with it. And to do further Ju&s;tice upon him&s;elf, de&s;ired 'em to tie an Halter about his Neck, as a Mark of that ignominious Puni&s;hment, which in his own Thoughts he had &s;o ju&s;tly de&s;erved.</P>
<P>I would not have Per&s;ecution &s;o far di&s;graced, as to wi&s;h the&s;e Vermin might be animadverted on by any Legal Penalties; tho' I think it would be highly rea&s;onable, that tho&s;e few of them who die in the Profe&s;&s;ions of their Infidelity, &s;hould have &s;uch Tokens of Infamy fixed upon them, as might di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e Bodies which are given up by the Owners to Oblivion and Putrefaction, from tho&s;e which re&s;t in Hope, and &s;hall ri&s;e in Glory. But at the &s;ame Time that I am again&s;t doing them the Honour of the Notice of our Laws, which ought not to &s;up|po&s;e there are &s;uch Criminals in Being, I have often wondered, how they can be tolerated in any mixed Conver&s;ations while they are vent|ing the&s;e ab&s;urd Opinions; and &s;hould think, that if on any &s;uch Occa&s;ion, half a Dozen of the mo&s;t robur&s;t Chri&s;tians in the Company would lead one of the&s;e Gentlemen to a Pump, or convey him into a Blanket, they would do very good Service both to Church and State. I do not know how the Laws &s;tand in this Parti|cular; but I hope, whatever Knocks, Bangs or Thumps, might be given with &s;uch an hone&s;t Intention, would not be con&s;trued as a Breach of the Peace. I dare &s;ay, they would not be

returned by the Per&s;on who receives them; for whatever the&s;e Fools may &s;ay in the Vanity of their Hearts, they are too wi&s;e to ri&s;que their Lives upon the Uncertainty of their Opinions.</P>
<P>When I was a young Man about this Town, I frequented the Ordinary of the <HI>Black-Hor&s;e</HI> in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> where the Per&s;on that u&s;ually pre&s;ided at the Table was a rough old-fa&s;hioned Gentle|man, who, according to the Cu&s;tom of tho&s;e Times, had been the Major and Preacher of a Regiment. It happened one Day that a noi&s;y young Officer, bred in <HI>France,</HI> was venting &s;ome new-frangled Notions, and &s;peaking, in the Gaiety of his Humour, again&s;t the Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence. The Major at fir&s;t only de&s;ired him to talk more re&s;pectfully of one for whom all the Company had an Honour; but finding him run on in his Extravagance, began to repri|mand him after a more &s;erious Manner. Young Man, &s;aid he, do not abu&s;e your Benefactor whil&s;t you are eating his Bread. Con&s;ider who&s;e Air you breathe, who&s;e Pre&s;ence you are in, and who it is that gave you the Power of that very Speech which you make u&s;e of to his Di&s;honour. The young Fellow, who thought to turn Mat|ters into a Je&s;t, asked him, if he was going to preach? But at the &s;ame Time de&s;ired him to take Care what he &s;aid when he &s;poke to a Man of Honour. A Man of Honour, &s;ays the Major, Thou art an Infidel and a Bla&s;phemer, and I &s;hall u&s;e thee as &s;uch. In &s;hort, the Quarrel ran &s;o high, that the Major was de&s;ired to walk out. Upon their coming into the Garden, the old Fellow advi&s;ed his Antagoni&s;t to con&s;ider the Place into which one Pa&s;s might drive him; but finding him grow upon him to a Degree of Scurrility, as believing the Advice proceeded from Fear; Sirrah, &s;ays he, If a Thunderbolt does not &s;trike the dead before I come at thee, I &s;hall not fail to cha&s;ti&s;e thee for thy Profane|ne&s;s

to thy Maker, and thy Sawcine&s;s to his Ser|vant. Upon this he drew his Sword, and cried out with a loud Voice, <HI>The Sword of the Lord and of Gideon;</HI> which &s;o terrified his Antagoni&s;t, that he was immediately di&s;armed, and thrown upon his Knees. In this Po&s;ture he begged his Life; but the Major refu&s;ed to grant it, before he had asked Pardon for his Offence in a &s;hort extemporary Prayer which the old Gentleman dictated to him upon the Spot, and which his Pro&s;elyte repeated after him in the Pre&s;ence of the whole Ordinary, that were now gathered about him in the Garden.</P>

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of <HI>Tom. Varni&s;h.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BECAUSE I have a profe&s;&s;ed Aver&s;ion to long Beginnings of Stories, I will go into this at once, by telling you, That there dwells near the <HI>Royal-Exchange</HI> as happy a Couple as ever enter'd into Wedlock. The&s;e live in that mutual Confidence of each other, which renders the Satisfactions of Marriage even greater than tho&s;e of Friend&s;hip, and makes Wife and Hu&s;|band the deare&s;t Appellations of Humane Life. Mr. <HI>Ballance</HI> is a Merchant of good Con&s;idera|tion, and under&s;tands the World not from Spe|culation, but Practice. His Wife is the Daugh|ter of an hone&s;t Hou&s;e, ever bred in a Family-Way; and has, from a natural good Under&s;tand|ng, and great Innocence, a Freedom which
<PB N="108" REF="115">
Men of Sen&s;e know to be the certain Sign of Virtue, and Fools take to be an Encouragement to Vice.</P>
<P><HI>Tom. Varni&s;h,</HI> a young Gentleman of the <HI>Middle-Temple,</HI> by the Bounty of a good Father who was &s;o obliging as to die, and leave him in his Twenty fourth Year, be&s;ides a good E&s;tate, a large Sum, which lay in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Bal|lance,</HI> had by this Means an Intimacy at his Hou&s;e; and being one of tho&s;e hard Students who read Plays for Improvement in the Law, took his Rules of Life from thence. Upon mature Deliberation, he conceived it very proper, that he, as a Man of Wit and Plea&s;ure of the Town, &s;hould have an Intrigue with his Merchant's Wife. He no &s;ooner thought of this Adventure, but he began it by an amorous Epi&s;tle to the Lady, and a faithful Promi&s;e to wait upon her, at a certain Hour the next Evening, when he knew her Husband was to be ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Letter was no &s;ooner received, but it was communicated to the Husband, and produced no other Effect in him, than that he joined with his Wife to rai&s;e all the Mirth they could out of this fanta&s;tical Piece of Gallantry. They were &s;o little concerned at this dangerous Man of Mode, that they plotted Ways to perplex him without hurting him. <HI>Varni&s;h</HI> comes exactly at his Hour; and the Lady's well acted Confu&s;ion at his En|trance, gave him Opportunity to repeat &s;ome Couplets very fit for the Occa&s;ion with very much Grace and Spirit. His Theatrical Manner of making Love was interrupted by an Alarm of the Husband's coming; and the Wife, in a per|&s;onated Terror, be&s;eeched him, If he had any Value for the Honour of a Woman that loved him, he would jump out of the Window. He did &s;o, and fell upon Feather-Beds placed on purpo&s;e to receive him.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="116">
It is not to be conceived how great the Joy of an amorous Man is when he has &s;uffered for his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and is never the wor&s;e for it. <HI>Varni&s;h</HI> the next Day writ a mo&s;t elegant Billet, where|in he &s;aid all that Imagination could form upon the Occa&s;ion. He violently prote&s;ted, going out of the Window was no Way terrible, but as it was going from her; with &s;everal other kind Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, which procured him a Second A&s;&s;igna|tion. Upon his &s;econd Vi&s;it, he was conveyed by a faithful Maid into her Bed-Chamber, and left there to expect the Arrival of her Mi&s;tre&s;s. But the Wench, according to her In&s;tructions, ran in again to him, and locked the Door after her to keep out her Ma&s;ter. She had ju&s;t Time enough to convey the Lover into a Che&s;t be|fore &s;he admitted the Husband and his Wife into the Room.</P>
<P>You may be &s;ure that Trunk was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be open'd; but upon her Husband's ordering it, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, &s;he had taken all the Care imaginable in packing up the Things with her own Hand, and he might &s;end the Trunk aboard as &s;oon as he thought fit. The ea&s;ie Husband believed his Wife, and the good Couple went to Bed; <HI>Varni&s;h</HI> having the Hap|pine&s;s to pa&s;s the Night in his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Bed-Chamber without Mole&s;tation. The Morning aro&s;e, but our Lover was not well &s;ituated to ob|&s;erve her Blu&s;hes; &s;o that all we know of his Sentiments on this Occa&s;ion, is, That he heard <HI>Ballance</HI> ask for the Key, and &s;ay, he would him&s;elf go with this Che&s;t, and have it opened before the Captain of the Ship, for the greater Safety of &s;o valuable a Lading.</P>
<P>The Goods were hoi&s;ted away, and Mr. <HI>Bal|lance</HI> marching by his Che&s;t with great Care and Diligence, omitted nothing that might give his Pa&s;&s;enger Perplexity. But to con&s;ummate all, he delivered the Che&s;t, with &s;trict Charge,
<PB N="110" REF="117">
in ca&s;e they were in Danger of being taken, to throw it over-board, for there were Letters in it, the Matter of which might be of great Service to the Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> It is not thought advi&s;able to proceed further in this Account, Mr. <HI>Varni&s;h</HI> being ju&s;t returned from his Travels, and willing to con|ceal the Occa&s;ion of his fir&s;t applying him&s;elf to the Languages.</P>

<P><HI>DICK Reptile</HI> and I &s;at this Evening later than the re&s;t of the Club; and as &s;ome Men are better Company when only with one Friend, others when there is a large Number, I found <HI>Dick</HI> to be of the former Kind. He was bewailing to me in very ju&s;t Terms, the Offences which he frequently met with in the Abu&s;e of Speech: Some u&s;e Ten Times more Words than they need, &s;ome put in Words quite foreign to their Purpo&s;e, and others adorn their Di&s;cour&s;es with Oaths and Bla&s;phemies by Way of Tropes and Figures. What my good Friend &s;tarted, dwelt upon me after I came Home this Evening, and led me into an Enquiry with my &s;elf, Whence &s;hould ari&s;e &s;uch &s;trange Excre&s;cencies in Di&s;|cour&s;e? Whereas it mu&s;t be obvious to all rea|&s;onable Beings, That the &s;ooner a Man &s;peaks his Mind, the more complai&s;ant he is to the Man with whom he talks: But upon mature Delibe|ration, I am come to this Re&s;olution, That for One Man who &s;peaks to be under&s;tood, there are Ten who talk only to be admired.</P>
<P>The ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> had little independent Sylla|bles called Expletives, which they brought into their Di&s;cour&s;es both in Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e, for no other Purpo&s;e but for the better Grace and Sound of their Sentences and Periods. I know no Ex|ample but this which can authori&s;e the U&s;e of
<PB N="113" REF="120">
more Words than are nece&s;&s;ary. But whether it be from this Freedom taken by that wi&s;e Nation, or however it ari&s;es, <HI>Dick Reptile</HI> hit upon a very ju&s;t and common Cau&s;e of Offence in the Generality of the People of all Orders. We have one here in our Lane who &s;peaks nothing without quoting an Authority; for it is always with him, So and &s;o, <HI>as the Man &s;aid.</HI> He asked me this Morning, How I did? <HI>as the Man &s;aid;</HI> and hoped I would come now and then to &s;ee him, <HI>as the Man &s;aid.</HI> I am acquainted with another, who never deli|vers him&s;elf upon any Subject, but he cries. He only &s;peaks his <HI>poor Judgment;</HI> this is his hum|ble Opinion; or as for his Part, if he might pre|&s;ume to offer any Thing on that Subject. But of all the Per&s;ons who add Elegancies and Superflui|ties to their Di&s;cour&s;es, tho&s;e who de&s;erve the foremo&s;t Rank, are the Swearers; and the Lump of the&s;e may, I think, be very aptly divided into the common Di&s;tinction of High and Low. Dulne&s;s and Barrenne&s;s of Thought is the Original of it in both the&s;e Sects, and they differ only in Con|&s;titution: The Low is generally a phlegmatick, and the High a cholerick Coxcomb. The Man of Phlegm is &s;en&s;ible of the Emptine&s;s of his Di&s;cour&s;e, and will tell you, That <HI>P&s;ackins,</HI> &s;uch a Thing is true: Or if you warm him a little, he may run into Pa&s;&s;ion, and cry, <HI>Odsbodikins,</HI> you do not &s;ay right. But the High affects a Sublimity in Dulne&s;s, and invokes Hell and Dam|nation at the Breaking of a Gla&s;s, or the Slow|ne&s;s of a Drawer.</P>
<P>I was the other Day trudging along <HI>Fleet&s;treet</HI> on Foot, and an old Army-Friend came up with me. We were both going towards <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and finding the Streets were &s;o crowded that we could not keep together, we re&s;olved to club for a Coach. This Gentleman I knew to be the Fir&s;t of the Order of the Cholerick. I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, (were there no Crime in it) nothing could
<PB N="114" REF="121">
be more diverting than the Impertinence of the High Juror: For whether there is Remedy or not again&s;t what offends him, &s;till he is to &s;how he is offended; and he mu&s;t &s;ure not omit to be magnificently pa&s;&s;ionate, by falling on all Things in his Way. We were &s;topped by a Train of Coaches at <HI>Temple-Bar.</HI> What the Devil! (&s;ays my Companion) cannot you drive on Coachman? D&mdash;n you all, for a Set of Sons of Whores, you will &s;top here to be paid by the Hour! There is not &s;uch a Set of confounded Dogs as the Coachmen unhang'd! But the&s;e ra&s;cally Cits&mdash;'Ounds, why &s;hould not there be a Tax to make the&s;e Dogs widen their Gates? Oh! but the Hell-hounds move at la&s;t. Ay, &s;aid I, I knew you wou'd make 'em whip on if once they heard you&mdash;No, &s;ays he; but would it not fret a Man to the De|vil, to pay for being carried &s;lower than he can walk. Lookee, there is for ever a Stop at this Hole by St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s Church. Blood, you Dog!&mdash;Harkee, Sirrah,&mdash;Why, and be d&mdash;n'd to you, do not you drive over that Fellow?&mdash;Thunder, Furies, and Damnation! I'll cut your Ears off, you Fellow before there.&mdash;Come hither, you Dog you, and let me ring your Neck round your Shoulders. We had a Repetition of the &s;ame Eloquence at the <HI>Cockpit,</HI> and the Turning into <HI>Palace-Yard.</HI></P>
<P>This gave me a perfect Image of the In&s;ignifi|cancy of the Creatures who practi&s;e this Enor|mity; and made me conclude, That it is ever Want of Sen&s;e makes a Man guilty in this Kind. It was excellently well &s;aid, That this Folly had no Temptation to excu&s;e it, no Man being born of a Swearing Con&s;titution. In a Word, a few rumbling Words and Con&s;onants clapped toge|ther, without any Sen&s;e, will make an accom|pli&s;hed Swearer: And it is needle&s;s to dwell long upon this Blu&s;tring Impertinence, which is already bani&s;hed out of the Society of well-bred

<P>IT is an Argument of a clear and worthy. Spi|rit in a Man, to be able to di&s;engage him&s;elf from the Opinions of others, &s;o far as not to let the Deference due to the Sen&s;e of Mankind in|&s;nare him to act again&s;t the Dictates of his own Rea&s;on. But the Generality of the World are &s;o far from walking by any &s;uch Maxim, that it is almo&s;t a &s;tanding Rule to do as others do, or be ridiculous. I have heard my old Friend Mr. <HI>Hart</HI> &s;peak it as an Ob&s;ervation among the Players, That it is impo&s;&s;ible to act with Grace, except the Actor has forgot that he is before an Audience. Till he has arrived at that, his Motion, his Air, his every Step and Ge&s;ture, has &s;omething in them which di&s;covers he is under a Re&s;traint for Fear of being ill received; or if he con&s;iders him&s;elf as in the Pre&s;ence of tho&s;e who approve his Behaviour, you &s;ee an Affectation of that Plea&s;ure run through his whole Carriage. It is as common in Life, as upon the Stage, to behold a Man in the mo&s;t indifferent Action betray a Sen&s;e he has of doing what he is about gracefully. Some have &s;uch an immoderate Reli&s;h for Ap|plau&s;e, that they expect it for Things, which in them&s;elves are &s;o frivolous, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, without this Affectation, to make them appear worthy either of Blame or Prai&s;e. There is <HI>Will Glare,</HI> &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately intent upon being admired,
<PB N="118" REF="125">
that when you &s;ee him in publick Places, every Mu&s;cle of his Face di&s;covers his Thoughts are fixed upon the Con&s;ideration of what Figure he makes. He will often fall into a mu&s;ing Po&s;ture to attract Ob&s;ervation, and is then obtruding him&s;elf upon the Company when he pretends to be withdrawn from it. Such little Arts are the certain and infallible Tokens of a &s;uperficial Mind, as the avoiding Ob&s;ervation is the Sign of a great and &s;ublime one. It is therefore extreme|ly difficult for a Man to judge even of his own Actions, without forming to him&s;elf an Idea of what he &s;hould act, were it in his Power to exe|cute all his De&s;ires without the Ob&s;ervation of the re&s;t of the World. There is an Allegorical Fable in <HI>Plato,</HI> which &s;eems to admoni&s;h us, That we are very little acquainted with our &s;elves, while we know our Actions are to pa&s;s the Cen|&s;ures of others; but had we the Power to accom|pli&s;h all our Wi&s;hes unob&s;erved, we &s;hould then ea&s;ily inform our &s;elves how far we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Real and Intrin&s;ick Virtue. The Fable I was go|ing to mention, is that of <HI>Gyges,</HI> who is &s;aid to have had an inchanted Ring, which had in it a miraculous Quality, making him who wore it vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible, as he turned it to or from his Body. The U&s;e <HI>Gyges</HI> made of his occa&s;ional In|vi&s;ibility, was, by the Advantage of it, to vio|late a Queen, and murder a King. <HI>Tully</HI> takes Notice of this Allegory, and &s;ays very hand&s;om|ly, That a Man of Honour who had &s;uch a Ring, would act ju&s;t in the &s;ame Manner as he would do without it. It is indeed no &s;mall Pitch of Virtue under the Temptation of Impunity, and the Hopes of accompli&s;hing all a Man's De&s;ires, not to tran&s;gre&s;s the Rules of Ju&s;tice and Virtue; but this is rather not being an ill Man, than be|ing po&s;itively a good one; and it &s;eems wonder|ful, that &s;o great a Soul as that of <HI>Tully,</HI> &s;hould not form to him&s;elf a Thou&s;and worthy Actions
<PB N="119" REF="126">
which a virtuous Mind would be prompted to by the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a Secret. There are cer|tainly &s;ome Part of Mankind who are Guardian Beings to the other. <HI>Sallu&s;t</HI> could &s;ay of <HI>Cato, That he had rather be than appear good;</HI> but in|deed, this Eulogium ro&s;e no higher than (as I ju&s;t now hinted) to an Inoffen&s;ivene&s;s, rather than an active Virtue. Had it occurred to the noble Ora|tor to repre&s;ent, in his Language, the glorious Plea&s;ures of a Man &s;ecretly employed in Benefi|cence and Genero&s;ity, it would certainly have made a more charming Page than any he has now left behind him. How might a Man, fur|ni&s;hed with <HI>Gyges</HI>'s Secret, employ it in bringing together di&s;tant Friends, laying Snares for crea|ting Good-will in the room of groundle&s;s Hatred; in removing the Pangs of an unju&s;t Jealou&s;y, the Shyne&s;s of an imperfect Reconciliation, and the Tremor of an awful Love? Such a one could give Confidence to ba&s;hful Merit, and Confu&s;ion to over-bearing Impudence.</P>
<P>Certain it is, That &s;ecret Kindne&s;&s;es done to Mankind, are as beautiful as &s;ecret Injuries are dete&s;table. To be invi&s;ibly good, is as God-like, as to be invi&s;ibly ill, Diabolical. As degenerate as we are apt to &s;ay the Age we live in is, there are &s;till among&s;t us Men of illu&s;trious Minds, who enjoy all the Plea&s;ures of good Actions, except that of being commended for them. There happens among others very worthy In&s;tan|ces of a publick Spirit, one of which I am obli|ged to di&s;cover, becau&s;e I know not otherwi&s;e how to obey the Commands of the Benefactor. A Citizen of <HI>London</HI> has given Directions to Mr. <HI>Rainer,</HI> the Writing Ma&s;ter of <HI>Paul</HI>'s School, to educate at his Charge Ten Boys (who &s;hall be nominated by me) in Writing and Accompts, till they &s;hall be fit for any Trade. I de&s;ire there|fore &s;uch as know any proper Objects for re|ceiving this Bounty, to give Notice thereof to
<PB N="120" REF="127">
Mr. <HI>Morphew,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Lillie,</HI> and they &s;hall, if properly qualified, have In&s;tructions accordingly.</P>
<P>Actions of this Kind have in them &s;omething &s;o tran&s;cendent, that it is an Injury to applaud them, and a Diminution of that Merit which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;hunning our Approbation. We &s;hall therefore leave them to enjoy that glorious Ob|&s;curity, and &s;ilently admire their Virtue, who can contemn the mo&s;t delicious of Humane Plea|&s;ures, that of receiving due Prai&s;e. Such Cele|&s;tial Di&s;po&s;itions very ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pend the Di&s;|covery of their Benefactions, till they come where their Actions cannot be mi&s;interpreted, and receive their fir&s;t Congratulations in the Com|pany of Angels.</P>

<P>WHEN I reflect upon the many Nights I have &s;at up for &s;ome Months la&s;t pa&s;t in the greate&s;t Anxiety for the Good of my Neigh|bours and Contemporaries, it is no &s;mall Di&s;cou|ragement to me, to &s;ee how &s;low a Progre&s;s I make in the Reformation of the World. But in|deed I mu&s;t do my Female Readers the Ju&s;tice to own, that their tender Hearts are much more &s;u&s;ceptible of good Impre&s;&s;ions, than the Minds of the other Sex. Bu&s;ine&s;s and Ambition take up Men's Thoughts too much to leave Room for Philo&s;ophy: But if you &s;peak to Women in a Style and Manner proper to approach them, they never fail to improve by your Coun&s;el. I &s;hall therefore for the future turn my Thoughts more particularly to their Service, and &s;tudy the be&s;t Methods to adorn their Per&s;ons, and inform their Minds in the ju&s;te&s;t Methods to make them what
<PB N="122" REF="129">
Nature de&s;igned them, the mo&s;t beauteous Ob|jects of our Eyes, and the mo&s;t agreeable Com|panions of our Lives. But when I &s;ay this, I mu&s;t not omit at the &s;ame Time to look into their Errors and Mi&s;takes, that being the readie&s;t Way to the intended End of adorning and in|&s;tructing them. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, That the very Inadvertencies of this Sex are owing to the other; for if Men were not Flatterers, Wo|men could not fall into that general Cau&s;e of all their Follies, and our Misfortunes, their Love of Flattery. Were the Commendation of the&s;e a|greeable Creatures built upon its proper Founda|tion, the higher we rai&s;ed their Opinion of them|&s;elves, the greater would be the Advantage to our Sex; but all the Topick of Prai&s;e is drawn from very &s;en&s;ele&s;s and extravagant Idea's we pretend we have of their Beauty and Perfection. Thus when a young Man falls in Love with a young Woman, from that Moment &s;he is no more Mrs. <HI>Alice</HI> &s;uch a one, born of &s;uch a Fa|ther, and educated by &s;uch a Mother, but from the fir&s;t Minute that he ca&s;t his Eye upon her with De&s;ire, he conceives a Doubt in his Mind, What Heavenly Power gave &s;o unexpected a Blow to an Heart that was ever before untouched. But who can re&s;i&s;t Fate and De&s;tiny, which are lodged in Mrs. <HI>Alice</HI>'s Eyes? After which he de|&s;ires Orders accordingly, Whether he is to live or breath; the Smile or Frown of his Godde&s;s is the only Thing that can now either &s;ave or de|&s;troy him. By this Means, the well-humoured Girl, that would have romped with him before &s;he received this Declaration, a&s;&s;umes a State &s;uitable to the Maje&s;ty he has given her, and treats him as the Va&s;&s;al he calls him&s;elf. The Girl's Head is immediately turned by having the Power of Life and Death, and takes Care to &s;uit every Motion and Air to her new Sovereignty. After he has placed him&s;elf at this Di&s;tance, he
<PB N="123" REF="130">
mu&s;t never hope to recover his former Familiarity, till &s;he has had the Addre&s;&s;es of another, and found them le&s;s &s;incere.</P>
<P>If the Application to Women were ju&s;tly turn|ed, the Addre&s;s of Flattery, tho' it implied at the &s;ame Time an Admonition, would be much more likely to &s;ucceed. Should a captivated Lover, in a Billet, let his Mi&s;tre&s;s know, That her Piety to her Parents, her Gentlene&s;s of Behaviour, her prudent Oeconomy with re&s;pect to her own lit|tle Affairs in a Virgin Condition, had improved the Pa&s;&s;ion which her Beauty had in&s;pired him with, into &s;o &s;ettled an E&s;teem for her, that of all Women breathing he wi&s;hed her his Wifes tho' his commending her for Qualities &s;he knew &s;he had as a Virgin, would make her believe he expected from her an an&s;werable Conduct in the Character of a Matron: I will an&s;wer for it, his Suit would be carried on with le&s;s Perplexity.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of this, the Generality of our young Women, taking all their Notions of Life from gay Writings, or Letters of Love, con&s;ider them|&s;elves as Godde&s;&s;es, Nymphs, and Shepherde&s;|&s;es.</P>
<P>By this Romantick Sen&s;e of Things, all the na|tural Relations and Duties of Life are forgotten, and our Female Part of Mankind are bred and treated, as if they were de&s;igned to inhabit the happy Fields of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> rather than be Wives and Mothers in old <HI>England.</HI> It is indeed long &s;ince I had the Happine&s;s to conver&s;e familiarly with this Sex, and therefore have been fearful of falling into the Error which reclu&s;e Men are very &s;ubject to, that of giving fal&s;e Repre&s;enta|tions of the World from which they have retired, by imaginary Schemes drawn from their own Re|flections. An old Man cannot ea&s;ily gain Admit|tance into the Dre&s;&s;ing-room of Ladies; I therefore thought it Time well &s;pent, to turn over <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and u&s;e all my occult Art, to give my old Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">|nelian
<PB N="124" REF="131">
Ring the &s;ame Force with that of <HI>Gyges,</HI> which I have lately &s;poken of. By the Help of this, I went unob&s;erved to a Friend's Hou&s;e of mine, and followed the Chamber-maid invi&s;ibly about Twelve of the Clock into the Bed-chamber of the beauteous <HI>Flavia,</HI> his Fine Daughter, ju&s;t before &s;he got up.</P>
<P>I drew the Curtains, and being wrapped up in the Safety of my old Age, could with much Plea&s;ure, without Pa&s;&s;ion, behold her &s;leeping with <HI>Waller</HI>'s Poems, and a Letter fixed in that Part of him, where every Woman thinks her &s;elf de&s;cribed. The Light fla&s;hing upon her Face, awakened her: She opened her Eyes, and her Lips too, repeating that Piece of fal&s;e Wit in that admired Poet;</P>
<Q><L>Such <HI>Helen</HI> was, And who can blame the Boy,</L>
<L>That in &s;o bright a Flame con&s;um'd his <HI>Troy?</HI></L></Q>
<P>This &s;he pronounced with a mo&s;t bewitching Sweetne&s;s; but after it fetched a Sigh, that me|thought had more De&s;ire than Langui&s;hment, then took out her Letter, and read aloud, for the Plea&s;ure, I &s;uppo&s;e, of hearing &s;oft Words in Prai&s;e of her &s;elf, the following Epi&s;tle:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Sat near you at the Opera la&s;t Night; but knew no Entertainment from the vain Show and Noi&s;e about me, while I waited wholly intent upon the Motion of your Bright Eyes, in Hopes of a Glance, that might re&s;tore me to the Plea&s;ures of Sight and Hearing in the mid&s;t of Beauty and Harmony. It is &s;aid, the Hell of the Accur&s;ed in the next Life, ari&s;es from an Incapacity to partake the Joys of the Ble&s;&s;ed, though they were to be admitted to them. Such I am &s;ure was my Condition all this Evening; and if you, my Deity, cannot have &s;o much Mercy, as to make me by your Influence capable of ta&s;ting
<PB N="125" REF="132">
the Satisfactions of Life, my Being is ended, which con&s;i&s;ted only in your Favour.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The Letter was hardly read over, when &s;he ru&s;h'd out of Bed in her Wrapping-Gown, and con&s;ulted her Gla&s;s for the Truth of his Pa&s;&s;ion. She rai&s;ed her Head, and turned it to a Profile, repeating the la&s;t Lines, <HI>My Being is ended, which con&s;i&s;ted only in your Favour.</HI> The Godde&s;s imme|diately called her Maid, and fell to dre&s;&s;ing that mi&s;chievous Face of hers, without any Manner of Con&s;ideration for the Mortal who had offered up his Petition. Nay, it was &s;o far otherwi&s;e, that the whole Time of her Woman's combing her Hair was &s;pent in Di&s;cour&s;e of the Imper|tinence of his Pa&s;&s;ion, and ended, in declaring a Re&s;olution, if &s;he ever had him, to make him wait. She al&s;o frankly told the Favourite Gyp&s;y that was prating to her, that her pa&s;&s;ionate Lo|ver had put it out of her Power to be civil to him, if &s;he were inclined to it; for (&s;aid &s;he) if I am thus Coele&s;tial to my Lover, he will cer|tainly &s;o far think him&s;elf di&s;appointed, as I grow into the Familiarity and Form of a mortal Woman.</P>
<P>I came away as I went in, without &s;taying for other Remarks than what confirmed me in the Opinion, That it is from the Notions the Men in&s;pire them with, that the Women are &s;o fanta|&s;tical in the Value of them&s;elves. This ima|ginary Pre-eminence which is given to the Fair Sex, is not only form'd from the Addre&s;&s;es of People of Condition; but it is the Fa&s;hion and Humour of all Orders to go regularly out of their Wits, as &s;oon as they begin to make Love. I know at this Time Three Godde&s;&s;es in the <HI>New-Exchange;</HI> and there are Two Shepherde&s;&s;es that &s;ell Gloves in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall.</HI></P>

<P>HAving a Daughter about Nine Years of Age, I would endeavour &s;he might have Education; I mean &s;uch as may be u&s;eful, as working well, and a good Deportment.

<P>The&s;e <HI>Whetters</HI> are a People I have con&s;idered with much Pains, aad find them to differ from a Sect I have heretofore &s;poken of, called <HI>Snuff-Takers,</HI> only in the Expedition they take in de|&s;troying their Brains: The <HI>Whetter</HI> is obliged to refre&s;h him&s;elf every Moment with a Liquor, as the <HI>Snuff Taker</HI> with a Powder. As for their Harmony in the Evening, I have nothing to ob|ject, provided they remove to <HI>Wapping</HI> or the <HI>Bridge-Foot,</HI> where it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that their Vociferations will annoy the Studious, the Bu&s;ie, or the Contemplative. I once had Lodg|ings in <HI>Grays-Inn,</HI> where we had two hard Stu|dents, who learned to play upon the Hautboy; and I had a Couple of Chamber-Fellows over my Head not le&s;s diligent in the Practice of Back-Sword and Single-Rapier. I remember the&s;e Gentlemen were a&s;&s;igned by the Benchers the Two Hou&s;es at the End of the Terras-Walk, as the only Places &s;it for their Meditations. Such Students as will let none improve but them|&s;elves, ought indeed to have their proper Di|&s;tances from Societies.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen of loud Mirth above-men|tioned I take to be, in the Quality of their Crime, the &s;ame as Eves-Droppers; for they who will be in your Company whether you will or no, are to as great a Degree Offen|ders, as they who hearken to what pa&s;&s;es with|out being of your Company at all. The ancient Puni&s;hment for the latter, when I fir&s;t came to
<PB N="134" REF="141">
this Town, was the Blanket, which I humbly conceive may be as ju&s;tly applied to him that bawls, as to him that li&s;tens. It is therefore provided for the future, That (except in the long Vacation) no Retainers to the Law, with Dulcimer, Violin, or any other In&s;trument, in any Tavern within a Furlong of an Inn of Court, &s;hall &s;ing any Tune, or pretended Tune what&s;o|ever, upon Pain of the Blanker, to be admini|&s;tred according to the Di&s;cretion of all &s;uch peaceable People as &s;hall be within the Annoy|ance. And it is further directed, That all Clerks who &s;hall offend in this Kind &s;hall forfeit their Indentures, and be turned over as A&s;&s;i&s;tants to the Clerks of Pari&s;hes within the Bills of Mortality, who are hereby empowered to de|mand them accordingly.</P>
<P>I am not to omit the Receipt of the following Letter, with a Nightcap, from my Valentine; which Nightcap I find was fini&s;hed in the Year 1588, and is too finely wrought to be of any mo|dern Stitching. Its Antiquity will better appear by my Valentine's own Words.</P>

<P>ALL Per&s;ons who employ them&s;elves in Pub|lick, are &s;till interrupted in the Cour&s;e of their Affairs: And it &s;eems, the admired Cavalier <HI>Nicolini</HI> him&s;elf is commanded by the Ladies, who at pre&s;ent employ their Time with great A&s;&s;iduity in the Care of the Nation, to put off his Day till he &s;hall receive their Commands, and Notice that they are at Lei&s;ure for Diver&s;ions. In the mean Time it is not to be expre&s;&s;ed, how many cold Chickens the Fair Ones have eaten &s;ince this Day Seven-night for the Good of their Country. This great Occa&s;ion has given Birth to many Di&s;coveries of high Moment for the Conduct of Life. There is a Toa&s;t of my Ac|quaintance told me, She had now found out, that it was Day before Nine in the Morning; and I am very confident, if the Affair holds many Days longer, the Ancient Hours of Eating will be revived among us, many having by it been made acquainted with the Luxury of Hunger and Thir&s;t.</P>
<P>There appears, methinks, &s;omething very vene|rable in all A&s;&s;emblies: And I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I en|vied all who had Youth and Health enough to make their Appearance there, that they had the Happine&s;s of being a whole Day in the be&s;t Company in the World. During the Adjourn|ments of that awful Court, a Neighbour of mine was telling me, That it gave him a Notion of the ancient Grandeur of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ho&s;pita|lity,
<PB N="137" REF="144">
to &s;ee <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall</HI> a Dining-Room. There is a Chearfulne&s;s at &s;uch Repa&s;ts, which is very delightful to Tempers which are &s;o happy as to be clear of Spleen and Vapour; for to the Jovial to &s;ee others plea&s;ed, is the greate&s;t of all Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>But &s;ince Age and Infirmities forbid my Ap|pearance at &s;uch publick Places, the next Hap|pine&s;s is to make the be&s;t U&s;e of Privacy, and acquit my &s;elf of the Demands of my Corre&s;|pondents. The following Letter is what has given me no &s;mall Inquietude, it being an Ac|cu&s;ation of Partiality, and Di&s;regard to Merit, in the Per&s;on of a Vertuo&s;o, who is the mo&s;t elo|quent of all Men upon &s;mall Occa&s;ions, and is the more to be admired for his prodigious Ferti|lity of Invention, which never appears but upon Subjects which others would have thought bar|ren. But in Con&s;ideration of his uncommon Talents, I am contented to let him be the Hero of my next Two Days, by in&s;erting his Friend's Recommendation of him at large.</P>

<P>I Am ju&s;t come out of the Country, and up|on peru&s;ing your late Lucubrations, I find <HI>Charles Lillie</HI> to be the Darling of your Affe|ctions, that you have give him a Place, and taken no &s;mall Pains to e&s;tabli&s;h him in the World; and at the &s;ame Time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ave pa&s;&s;ed by his Name-&s;ake at this End of the Town, as if he was a Citizen defunct, and one of no U&s;e in a Commonwealth. I mu&s;t own, his Cir|cum&s;tances are &s;o good, and &s;o well known, that he does not &s;tand in Need of having his Fame publi&s;hed to the World; but being of an ambitious Spirit, and an a&s;piring Soul, he would be rather proud of the Honour, than de|&s;irous of the Profit, which might re&s;ult from your Recommendation. He is a Per&s;on of a
<PB N="138" REF="145">
particular Genius, the Fir&s;t that brought Toys in Fa&s;hion, and Bawbles to Perfection. He is admirably well ver&s;ed in Screws, Springs, and Hinges, and deeply read in Knives, Combs or Sci&s;&s;ars, Buttons or Buckles. He is a perfect Ma&s;ter of Words, which uttered with a &s;mooth voluble Tongue, flow into a mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive Eloquence; in&s;omuch that I have known a Gentleman of Di&s;tinction find &s;everal ingenious Faults with a Toy of his, and &s;hew his utmo&s;t Di&s;like to it, as being either u&s;ele&s;s, or ill con|trived; but when the Orator behind the Counter had harangued upon it for an Hour and a half, di&s;play'd its hidden Beauties, and revealed its &s;ecret Perfections, he has wondered how he had been able to &s;pend &s;o great a Part of his Life without &s;o important an Uten&s;il. I won't pretend to furni&s;h out an Inventory of all the valuable Commodities that are to be found at his Shop.</P>
<P>I &s;hall content my &s;elf with giving an Ac|count of what I think mo&s;t curious. <HI>Imprimis,</HI> his Pocket-Books are very neat, and well con|trived, not for keeping <HI>Bank</HI> Bills or Gold|&s;miths Notes, I confe&s;s; but they are admira|ble for regi&s;tring the Lodgings of <HI>Madona</HI>'s, and for pre&s;erving Letters from Ladies of Quality. His Whips and Spurs are &s;o nice, that they'll make one that buys them ride a Fox-hunting, tho' before he hated Noi&s;e and early Ri&s;ing, and was afraid of breaking his Neck. His Seals are curiou&s;ly fancied, and exqui&s;itely well cut, and of great U&s;e to encourage young Gentlemen to write a good Hand. <HI>Ned Puzzle|po&s;t</HI> had been ill u&s;ed by his Writing-Ma&s;ter, and writ a Sort of a <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> or downright <HI>Scrawlian:</HI> However, upon his buying a Seal of my Friend, he is &s;o much improved by con|tinual Writing, that it is believed in a &s;hort Time one may be able to read his Letters, and
<PB N="139" REF="146">
find out his Meaning, without gue&s;&s;ing. His Pi&s;tols and Fu&s;ees are &s;o very good, that they are fit to be laid up among the fine&s;t <HI>China.</HI> Then his Tweezer-Ca&s;es are incomparable: You &s;hall have one not much bigger than your Finger, with 17 &s;everal In&s;truments in it, all nece&s;&s;ary every Hour of the Day, during the whole Cour&s;e of a Man's Life. But if this Vertuo&s;o excels in one Thing more than ano|ther, 'tis in Canes: He has &s;pent his mo&s;t &s;e|lect Hours in the Knowledge of them, and is arrived at that Perfection, that he is able to hold forth upon Canes longer than upon any one Subject in the World. Indeed his Canes are &s;o finely clouded, and &s;o well made up, either with Gold or Amber-Heads, that I am of the Opinion 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for a Gentleman to walk, talk, &s;it, or &s;tand as he &s;hould do, without one of them. He knows the Value of a Cane, by knowing the Value of the Buyer's E&s;tate. Sir <HI>Timothy Shallow</HI> has Two Thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> and <HI>Tom. Empty</HI> One. They both at &s;everal Times bought a Cane of <HI>Charles:</HI> Sir <HI>Timothy</HI>'s co&s;t Ten Guinea's, and <HI>Tom. Empty</HI>'s Five. Upon comparing them, they were perfectly alike. Sir <HI>Timothy</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed there &s;hould be no Dif|ference in the Canes, and &s;o much in the Price, comes to <HI>Charles.</HI> Damn it, <HI>Charles,</HI> &s;ays he, you have &s;old me a Cane here for Ten Pieces, and the very &s;ame to <HI>Tom. Empty</HI> for Five. Lord, Sir <HI>Timothy,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Charles,</HI> I am concerned that you, whom I took to under|&s;tand Canes better than any Baronet in Town, &s;hould be &s;o over&s;een: Why, Sir <HI>Timothy,</HI> yours is a true <HI>Jambee,</HI> and Squire <HI>Empty</HI>'s only a plain Dragon.</P>
<P>This Vertuo&s;o has a Parcel of <HI>Jambees</HI> now growing in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> where he keeps a Man on purpo&s;e to look after them, which will
<PB N="140" REF="147">
be the fine&s;t that ever landed in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and will be &s;it to cut about Two Years hence. Any Gentleman may &s;ub&s;cribe for as many as he plea&s;es. Sub&s;criptions will be taken in at his Shop at Ten Guinea's each Joint. They that &s;ub&s;cribe for Six, &s;hall have a Dragon <HI>Gratis.</HI> This is all I have to &s;ay at pre&s;ent concerning <HI>Charles</HI>'s Curio&s;ities; and hope it may be &s;uf|ficient to prevail with you to take him into your Con&s;ideration, which if you comply with, you will oblige,</P>

<P>I Was this Afternoon &s;urpri&s;ed with a Vi&s;it from my Si&s;ter <HI>Jenny,</HI> after an Ab&s;ence of &s;ome Time. She had, methought, in her Manner and Air, &s;omething that was a little below that of the Women of fir&s;t Breeding and Quality, but at the &s;ame Time above the Simplicity and Familiarity of her u&s;ual Deportment. As &s;oon as &s;he was &s;eated, &s;he began to talk to me of the odd Place
<PB N="141" REF="148">
I lived in, and begged of me to remove out of the Lane where I have been &s;o long acquainted; for (&s;aid &s;he) it does &s;o &s;poil one's Hor&s;es, that I mu&s;t beg your Pardon if you &s;ee me much &s;eldom|er, when I am to make &s;o great a Journey with a &s;ingle Pair, and make Vi&s;its and get Home the &s;ame Night. I under&s;tood her pretty well, but would not; therefore de&s;ired her to pay off her Coach, for I had a great deal to talk to her. She very pertly told me, She came in her own Chariot. Why, &s;aid I, is your Husband in Town? And has he &s;et up an Equipage? No, an&s;wered &s;he, but I have received 500 <HI>l.</HI> by his Order; and his Letters, which came at the &s;ame Time, bad me want for nothing that was nece&s;&s;ary. I was heartily concerned at her Folly, who&s;e Affairs render her but ju&s;t able to bear &s;uch an Expence. However I con&s;idered, that according to the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Cu&s;tom of treating Women, there is no other Method to be u&s;ed in removing any of their Faults and Errors, but conducting their Minds from one Humour to another, with as much Ce|remony as we lead their Per&s;ons from one Place to another. I therefore di&s;&s;embled my Concern, and in Compliance with her, as a Lady that was to u&s;e her Feet no more, I begged of her, after a &s;hort Vi&s;it, to let me per&s;uade her not to &s;tay out till it was late, for fear of catching Cold as &s;he went into her Coach in the Dampne&s;s of the Evening. The <HI>Malapert</HI> knew well enough I laughed at her, but was not ill plea&s;ed with the Certainty of her Power over her Husband, who, &s;he knew, would &s;upport her in any Humour he was able, rather than pa&s;s through the Torment of an Expo&s;tulation, to gain&s;ay any Thing &s;he had a Mind to.

<P>I Am at pre&s;ent under very much Concern at the &s;plendid Appearance I &s;aw my Si&s;ter make in an Equipage which &s;he has &s;et up in your Ab&s;ence. I beg of you not to indulge her in this Vanity; and de&s;ire you to con&s;i|der, the World is &s;o whim&s;ical, that though it will value you for being happy, it will hate you for appearing &s;o. The Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Wi&s;dom and Virtue (the only &s;olid Di&s;tinctions of Life) is allowed much more ea&s;ily than that of Wealth and Quality. Be&s;ides which, I mu&s;t intreat you to weigh with your &s;elf, What it is that People aim at in &s;etting them&s;elves out to Show in gay Equipages, and moderate Fortunes? You are not by this Means a better Man than your Neighbour is; but your Hor&s;es are better than his are. And will you &s;uffer Care and Inquietude, to have it &s;aid as you pa&s;s by, Tho&s;e are very pretty punch Nags? Nay, when you have arrived at this, there are a Hundred worth|le&s;s Fellows who are &s;till Four Hor&s;es happier than you are. Remember, dear Brother, there is a certain Mode&s;ty in the Enjoyment of mo|derate Wealth, which to tran&s;gre&s;s, expo&s;es Men to the utmo&s;t Deri&s;ion; and as there is nothing but Meanne&s;s of Spirit can move a Man to value him&s;elf upon what can be purcha&s;ed with Mo|ney, &s;o he that &s;hows an Ambition that Way, and cannot arrive at it, is more emphatically guilty of that Meanne&s;s.

<P>IN a Nation of Liberty, there is hardly a Per|&s;on in the whole Ma&s;s of the People more ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary than a Cen&s;or. It is allowed, that I have no Authority for a&s;&s;uming this impor|tant Appellation, and that I am Cen&s;or of the&s;e Nations, ju&s;t as one is cho&s;en King at the Game of Que&s;tions and Commands: But if, in the Exe|cution of this fanta&s;tical Dignity, I ob&s;erve upon Things which do not fall within the Cognizance of real Authority, I hope it will be granted, that an idle Man could not be more u&s;efully employed. Among all the Irregularities of which I have ta|ken Notice, I know none &s;o proper to be pre&s;ent|ed to the World by a Cen&s;or, as that of the gene|ral Expence and Affectation in Equipage. I have lately hinted, that this Extravagance mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily get Footing where we have no &s;umptuary Laws, and where every Man may be dre&s;&s;ed, at|tended, and carried, in what Manner he plea&s;es. But my Tenderne&s;s to my Fellow Subjects will not permit me to let this Enormity go unob|&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="153">
As the Matter now &s;tands, every Man takes it in his Head, that he has a Liberty to &s;pend his Money as he plea&s;es. Thus, in Spight of all Order, Ju&s;tice, and Decorum, we the greater Number of the Queen's loyal Subjects, for no Rea&s;on in the World but becau&s;e we want Money, do not &s;hare alike in the Divi&s;ion of Her Maje&s;ty's High-Road. The Hor&s;es and Slaves of the Rich take up the whole Street, while we Peripateticks are very glad to watch an Opportunity to whisk cro&s;s a Pa&s;|&s;age, very thankful that we are not run over for interrupting the Machine, that carries in it a Per|&s;on neither more hand&s;ome, wi&s;e, or valiant than the Meane&s;t of us. For this Rea&s;on, were I to propo&s;e a Tax, it &s;hould certainly be upon Coaches and Chairs: For no Man living can a&s;|&s;ign a Rea&s;on, why one Man &s;hould have half a Street to carry him at his Ea&s;e, and perhaps only in Pur&s;uit of Plea&s;ures, when as good a Man as him&s;elf wants Room for his own Per&s;on to pa&s;s upon the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and urgent Occa&s;ion. Till &s;uch an Acknowledgment is made to the Pub|lick, I &s;hall take upon me to ve&s;t certain Rights in the Scavengers of the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> to take the Hor&s;es and Servants of all &s;uch as do not become or de&s;erve &s;uch Di&s;tinctions into their peculiar Cu&s;tody. The Offenders them|&s;elves I &s;hall allow &s;afe Conduct to their Places of Abode in the Carts of the &s;aid Scavengers, but their Hor&s;es &s;hall be mounted by their Footmen, and &s;ent into the Service Abroad: And I take this Opportunity in the fir&s;t Place to recruit the Regiment of my good old Friend the brave and hone&s;t <HI>Sylvius,</HI> that they be as well taught as they are fed. It is to me mo&s;t miraculous, &s;o unrea|&s;onable an U&s;urpation as this I am &s;peaking of &s;hould &s;o long have been tolerated. We hang a poor Fellow for taking any trifle from us on the Road, and bear with the Rich for robbing us of the Road it &s;elf. Such a Tax as this, would be of
<PB N="147" REF="154">
great Satisfaction to us who walk on Foot; and &s;ince the Di&s;tinction of riding in a Coach is not to be appointed according to a Man's Merit or Ser|vice to their Country, nor that Liberty given as a Reward for &s;ome eminent Virtue, we &s;hould be highly contented to &s;ee them pay &s;omething for the In&s;ult they do us in the State they take upon them while they are drawn by us.</P>
<P>'Till they have made us &s;ome Reparation of this Kind, we the Peripateticks of <HI>Great Britain</HI> can|not think our &s;elves well treated, while every one that is able is allowed to &s;et up an Equipage.</P>
<P>As for my Part, I cannot but admire how Per|&s;ons, con&s;cious to them&s;elves of no Manner of Superiority above others, can out of meer Pride or Lazine&s;s expo&s;e them&s;elves at this Rate to pub|lick View, and put us all upon pronouncing tho&s;e Three terrible Syllables, Who is that? When it comes to that Que&s;tion, our Method is to con&s;i|der the Mien and Air of the Pa&s;&s;enger, and com|fort our &s;elves for being dirty to the Ankles, by laughing at his Figure and Appearance who over|looks us. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, were it not for the &s;o|lid Inju&s;tice of the Thing, there is nothing could afford a di&s;cerning Eye greater Occa&s;ion for Mirth, than this licentious Huddle of Qualities and Characters in the Equipages about this Town. The Over&s;eers of the Highway and Con&s;tables have &s;o little Skill or Power to rectify this Mat+ter, that you may often &s;ee the Equipage of a Fel|low whom all the Town knows to de&s;erve hang|ing, make a Stop that &s;hall interrupt the Lord High Chancellor and all the Judges in their Way to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>For the better under&s;tanding of Things and Per|&s;ons in this general Confu&s;ion, I have given Di|rections to all the Coach-Makers and Coach-Painters in Town, to bring me in Li&s;ts of their &s;everal Cu&s;tomers; and doubt not, but with com|paring the Orders of each Man, in the placing his
<PB N="148" REF="155">
Arms on the Doors of his Chariot, as well as the Words, Devices and Cyphers to be fix'd upon them, to make a Collection which &s;hall let us into the Nature, if not the Hi&s;tory, of Mankind, more u&s;efully than the Curio&s;ities of any Medal|li&s;t in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But this Evil of Vanity in our Figure, with many others, proceeds from a certain Gaie|ty of Heart, which has crept into Men's very Thoughts and Complexions. The Pa&s;&s;ions and Adventures of Hero's, when they enter the Li&s;ts for the Tournament in Romances, are not more ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable by their Palfreys and their Armour, than the &s;ecret Springs and Affections of the &s;everal Pretenders to Show among&s;t us are known by their Equipages in ordinary Life. The young Bridegroom with his gilded Cupids, and winged Angels, has &s;ome Excu&s;e in the Joy of his Heart to launch out into &s;omething that may be &s;ignificant of his pre&s;ent Happine&s;s: But to &s;ee Men, for no Rea&s;on upon Earth but that they are rich, a&s;cend Triumphant Chariots, and ride thro' the People, has at the Bottom nothing el&s;e in it but an in&s;olent Tran&s;port, ari&s;ing only from the Di&s;tinction of Fortune.</P>
<P>It is therefore high Time that I call in &s;uch Coaches as are in their Embelli&s;hments improper for the Character of their Owners. But if I find I am not obeyed herein, and that I cannot pull down the&s;e Equipages already erected, I &s;hall take upon me to prevent the Growth of this Evil for the future, by enquiring into the Preten&s;ions of the Per&s;ons who &s;hall hereafter attempt to make publick Entries with Ornaments and Decorations of their own Appointment. If a Man, who be|lieved he had the hand&s;ome&s;t Leg in this King|dom, &s;hould take a Fancy to adorn &s;o de&s;erving a Limb with a blue Garter, he would ju&s;tly be puni&s;hed for offending again&s;t the Mo&s;t Noble Order: And, I think, the general Pro&s;titution
<PB N="149" REF="156">
of Equipage and Retinue is as de&s;tructive to all Di&s;tinction, as the Impertinence of one Man, if permitted, would certainly be to that illu&s;trious Fraternity.</P>

<P>THIS Evening was allotted for taking into Con&s;ideration a late Reque&s;t of two indul|gent Parents, touching the Care of a young Daughter, whom they de&s;ign to &s;end to a Board|ing-School, or keep at Home, according to my Determination; but I am diverted from that Sub|ject by Letters which I have received from &s;eve|ral Ladies, complaining of a certain Sect of pro|fe&s;&s;ed Enemies to the Repo&s;e of the Fair Sex, cal|led Oglers. The&s;e are, it &s;eems, Gentlemen who look with deep Attention on one Object at the
<PB N="150" REF="157">
Play-hou&s;es, and are ever &s;taring all round them in Churches. It is urged by my Corre&s;pondents, that they do all that is po&s;&s;ible to keep their Eyes off the&s;e In&s;narers; but that, by what Power they know not, both their Diver&s;ions and Devo|tions are interrupted by them in &s;uch a Manner, as that they cannot attend either, without &s;tealing Looks at the Per&s;ons who&s;e Eyes are fixed upon them. By this Means, my Petitioners &s;ay, they find them&s;elves grow in&s;en&s;ibly le&s;s offended, and in Time enamoured, of the&s;e their Enemies. What is required of me on this Occa&s;ion, is, That as I love and &s;tudy to pre&s;erve the better Part of Man|kind, the Females, I would give them &s;ome Ac|count of this dangerous Way of A&s;&s;ault, again&s;t which there is &s;o little Defence, that it lays Am|bu&s;h for the Sight it &s;elf, and makes them &s;ee|ingly, knowingly, willingly, and forcibly go on to their own Captivity.</P>
<P>This Repre&s;entation of the pre&s;ent State of Af|fairs between the Two Sexes gave me very much Alarm; and I had no more to do, but to recollect what I had &s;een at any one A&s;&s;embly for &s;ome Years la&s;t pa&s;t, to be convinced of the Truth and Ju&s;tice of this Remon&s;trance. If there be not a Stop put to this evil Art, all the Modes of Addre&s;s, and the elegant Embelli&s;hments of Life, which ari&s;e out of the noble Pa&s;&s;ion of Love, will of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity decay. Who would be at the Trouble of Rhetorick, or &s;tudy the <HI>Bon Mien,</HI> when his Intro|duction is &s;o much ea&s;ier obtained, by a &s;udden Reverence in a downca&s;t Look at the meeting the Eye of a Fair Lady, and beginning again to ogle her as &s;oon as &s;he glances another Way? I remem|ber very well, when I was la&s;t at an Opera, I could perceive the Eyes of the whole Audience la&s;t into particular cro&s;s Angles one upon ano|ther, without any Manner of Regard to the Stage, though King <HI>Latinus</HI> was him&s;elf pre&s;ent when I made that Ob&s;ervation. It was then very plea|&s;ant
<PB N="151" REF="158">
to look into the Hearts of the whole Com|pany; for the Balls of Sight are &s;o form'd, that one Man's Eyes are Spectacles to another to read his Heart with. The mo&s;t ordinary Beholder can take Notice of any violent Agitation in the Mind, any plea&s;ing Tran&s;port, or any inward Grief, in the Per&s;on he looks at; but one of the&s;e Oglers can &s;ee a &s;tudied Indifference, a concealed Love, or a &s;mother'd Re&s;entment, in the very Glances that are made to hide tho&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions of Thought. The Naturali&s;ts tell us, That the Rattle Snake will fix him&s;elf under a Tree where he &s;ees a Squirrel playing; and when he has once got the Exchange of a Glance from the pretty Wan|ton, will give it &s;uch a &s;udden Stroke on its Ima|gination, that though it may play from Bough to Bough, and &s;trive to avert its Eyes from it for &s;ome Time, yet it comes nearer and nearer by little In|tervals of looking another Way, 'till it drops into the Jaws of the Animal, which it knew gazed at it for no other Rea&s;on but to ruin it. I did not believe this Piece of Philo&s;ophy 'till that Night I was ju&s;t now &s;peaking of; but I then &s;aw the &s;ame Thing pa&s;s between an Ogler and a Coquer. <HI>Mirtillo,</HI> the mo&s;t learned of the former, had for &s;ome Time di&s;continued to vi&s;it <HI>Flavia,</HI> no le&s;s eminent among the latter. They indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided all Places where they might probably meet, but Chance brought them together to the Playhou&s;e, and &s;eated them in a direct Line over|again&s;t each other, &s;he in a Front Box, he in the Pit next the Stage. As &s;oon as <HI>Flavia</HI> had recei|ved the Looks of the whole Crowd below her with that Air of In&s;en&s;ibility, which is nece&s;&s;ary at the fir&s;t Entrance, &s;he began to look round her and &s;aw the Vagabond <HI>Mirtillo,</HI> who had &s;o long ab&s;ented him&s;elf from her Circle; and when &s;he fir&s;t di&s;cover'd him, &s;he looked upon him with that Glance, which, in the Language of Oglers, is call'd the <HI>Scornful,</HI> but immediately turn'd her
<PB N="152" REF="159">
Ob&s;ervation another Way, and returned upon him with the <HI>Indifferent.</HI> This gave <HI>Mirtillo</HI> no &s;mall Re&s;entment; but he u&s;ed her accordingly. He took Care to be ready for her next Glance. She found his Eyes full in the Indolent, with his Lips crumpled up in the Po&s;ture of one Whi&s;tling. Her Anger at this U&s;age immediately appeared in every Mu&s;cle of her Face; and after many Emo|tions, which gli&s;ten'd in her Eyes, &s;he ca&s;t them round the whole Hou&s;e, and gave 'em Softne&s;&s;es in the Face of every Man &s;he had ever &s;een before. After &s;he thought &s;he had reduced all &s;he &s;aw to her Obedience, the Play began and ended their Dialogue. As &s;oon as the fir&s;t Act was over, &s;he &s;tood up with a Vi&s;age full of di&s;&s;embled Alacrity and Plea&s;ure, with which &s;he overlooked the Au|dience, and at la&s;t came to him; He was then placed in a Side-way, with his Hat &s;louching over his Eyes, and gazing at a Wench in the Side-Box, as talking of that Gip&s;y to the Gentle|man who &s;ate by him. But as &s;he was fixed upon him, he turned &s;uddenly with a full Face upon her, and with all the Re&s;pect imaginable, made her the mo&s;t ob&s;equious Bow in the Pre&s;ence of the whole Theatre. This gave her a Plea&s;ure not to be concealed, and &s;he made him the Recovering or Second Courte&s;y, with a Smile that &s;poke a per|fect Reconciliation. Between the en&s;uing Acts, they talked to each other with Ge&s;tures and Glan|ces &s;o &s;ignificant, that they ridiculed the whole Hou&s;e in this &s;ilent Speech, and made an Appoint|ment that <HI>Mirtillo</HI> &s;hould lead her to her Coach.</P>
<P>The peculiar Language of one Eye, as it differs from another, as much as the Tone of one Voice from another, and the Fa&s;cination or Enchant|ment which is lodged in the Optick Nerves of the Per&s;ons concerned in the&s;e Dialogues, is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, too nice a Subject for one who is not an Adept in the&s;e Speculations; but I &s;hall, for the Good and Safety of the Fair Sex, call my

On the contrary, I &s;hall conceal the true Meaning of the Looks of Ladies, and indulge in them all the Art they can acquire in the Management of their Glances: All which is but too little again&s;t Creatures who tri|umph in Fal&s;hood, and begin to for&s;wear with their Eyes, when their Tongues can be no longer believed.</P>

<P>AMong the various Sets of Corre&s;pondents who apply to me for Advice, and &s;end up their Ca&s;es from all Parts of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> there are none who are more importunate with me, and whom I am more inclined to an&s;wer, than the <HI>Complainers.</HI> One of them dates his Letter to me from the Banks of a purling Stream, where he u&s;ed to ruminate in Solitude upon the Divine <HI>Clari&s;&s;a,</HI> and where he is now looking about for a Convenient Leap, which he tells me he is re|&s;olved to take, unle&s;s I &s;upport him under the Lo&s;s of that charming perjured Woman. Poor <HI>Lavinia</HI> pre&s;&s;es as much for Con&s;olation on the other Side, and is reduced to &s;uch an Extremity of De&s;pair by the Incon&s;tancy of <HI>Philander,</HI> that &s;he tells me &s;he writes her Letter with her Pen in one Hand, and her Garter in the other. A Gentleman of an ancient Family in <HI>Norfolk</HI> is al|mo&s;t out of his Wits upon Account of a Grey|hound, that after having been his in&s;eparable Companion for Ten Years, is at la&s;t run mad.

In &s;hort, there is &s;carce a Calamity in humane Life that has not produced me a Letter.</P>
<P>It is indeed wonderful to con&s;ider, how Men are able to rai&s;e Affliction to them&s;elves out of every Thing. Lands and Hou&s;es, Sheep and Oxen, can convey Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery into the Hearts of rea&s;onable Creatures. Nay, I have known a Muff, a Scarf, or a Tippet, become a &s;olid Ble&s;|&s;ing or Misfortune. A Lap-Dog has broke the Hearts of Thou&s;ands. <HI>Flavia,</HI> who had buried Five Children, and Two Husbands, was never able to get over the Lo&s;s of her Parrat. How of|ten has a Divine Creature been thrown into a Fit by a Neglect at a Ball or an A&s;&s;embly? <HI>Mop&s;a</HI> has kept her Chamber ever &s;ince the la&s;t Ma&s;que|rade, and is in greater Danger of her Life upon being left out of it, than <HI>Clarinda</HI> from the vio|lent Cold which &s;he caught at it. Nor are the&s;e dear Creatures the only Sufferers by &s;uch imagi|nary Calamities: Many an Author has been de|jected at the Cen&s;ure of one whom he ever looked upon as an Idiot; and many a Hero ca&s;t into a Fit of Melancholy, becau&s;e the Rabble have not hooted at him as he pa&s;&s;ed through the Streets. <HI>Theron</HI> places all his Happine&s;s in a Running Hor&s;e, <HI>Suffenus</HI> in a Gilded Chariot, <HI>Fulvius</HI> in a Blue String, and <HI>Florio</HI> in a Tulip Root. It would be endle&s;s to enumerate the many fanta&s;tical Afflictions that di&s;turb Mankind; but as a Mi&s;ery is not to be mea&s;ured from the Nature of the Evil, but from the Temper of the Sufferer, I &s;hall pre&s;ent my Readers, who are unhappy either in Reality or Imagination, with an Allegory, for which I am indebted to the great Father and Prince of Poets.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="163">
As I was &s;itting after Dinner in my Elbow-Chair, I took up <HI>Homer,</HI> and dipped into that famous Speech of <HI>Achilles</HI> to <HI>Priam,</HI> in which he tells him, That <HI>Jupiter</HI> has by him Two great Ve&s;&s;els, the one filled with Ble&s;&s;ings, and the other with Misfortunes; out of which he mingles a Compo&s;ition for every Man that comes into the World. This Pa&s;&s;age &s;o exceedingly plea&s;ed me, that as I fell in&s;en&s;ibly into my Afternoon's Slum|ber, it wrought my Imagination into the follow|ing Dream.</P>
<P>When <HI>Jupiter</HI> took into his Hands the Govern|ment of the World, the &s;everal Parts of Nature, with the Pre&s;iding Deities, did Homage to him. One pre&s;ented him with a Mountain of Winds, another with a Magazine of Hail, and a third with a Pile of Thunder-bolts. The Stars offer'd up their Influences; the Ocean gave in his Tri|dent, the Earth her Fruits, and the Sun his Sea|&s;ons. Among the &s;everal Deities who came to make their Court on this Occa&s;ion, the De&s;tinies advanced with two great Tuns carried before them, one of which they fixed at the Right Hand of <HI>Jupiter</HI> as he &s;ate upon his Throne, and the other on his Left. The fir&s;t was filled with all the Ble&s;&s;ings, and the other with all the Calami|ties of Humane Life. <HI>Jupiter,</HI> in the Beginning of his Reign, finding the World much more in|nocent than it is in this Iron Age, poured very plentifully out of the Tun that &s;tood at his Right Hand; but as Mankind degenerated, and became unworthy of his Ble&s;&s;ings, he &s;et abroach the other Ve&s;&s;el, that filled the World with Pain and Poverty, Battles and Di&s;tempers, Jealou&s;y and Fal&s;hood, intoxicating Plea&s;ures and untimely Deaths.</P>
<P>He was at length &s;o very much incen&s;ed at the great Depravation of Humane Nature, and the repeated Provocations which he received from all Parts of the Earth, that having re&s;olved to de|&s;troy
<PB N="157" REF="164">
the whole Species, except <HI>Deucalion</HI> and <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> he commanded the De&s;tinies to gather up the Ble&s;&s;ings which he had thrown away upon the Sons of Men, and lay them up till the World &s;hould be inhabited by a more virtuous and de&s;er|ving Race of Mortals.</P>
<P>The Three Si&s;ters immediately repaired to the Earth, in Search of the &s;everal Ble&s;&s;ings that had been &s;catter'd on it; but found the Task which was enjoined them, to be much more difficult than they had imagin'd. The fir&s;t Places they re&s;orted to, as the mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed in; were Cities, Palaces, and Courts; but in&s;tead of meet|ing with what they looked for here, they found nothing but Envy, Repining, Unea&s;ine&s;s, and the like bitter Ingredients, of the Left-Hand Ve&s;&s;el. Whereas, to their great Surprize, they di&s;covered Content, Chearfulne&s;s, Health, Innocence, and other the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial Ble&s;&s;ings of Life, in Cottages, Shades, and Solitudes.</P>
<P>There was another Circum&s;tance no le&s;s unex|pected than the former, and which gave them very great Perplexity in the Di&s;charge of the Tru&s;t which <HI>Jupiter</HI> had committed to them. They ob&s;erved, that &s;everal Ble&s;&s;ings had dege|nerated into Calamities, and that &s;everal Calami|ties had improved into Ble&s;&s;ings, according as they fell into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wi&s;e or fooli&s;h Men. They often found Power, with &s;o much In&s;olence and Impatience cleaving to it, that it became a Misfortune to the Per&s;on on whom it was conferred. Youth had often Di&s;tempers growing about it, wor&s;e than the Infirmities of old Age: Wealth was often united to &s;uch a &s;ordid Avarice, as made it the mo&s;t uncomforta|ble and painful Kind of Poverty. On the contra|ry, they often found Pain made glorious by For|titude, Poverty lo&s;t in Content, Deformity beau|tified with Virtue. In a Word, the Ble&s;&s;ings were often like good Fruits planted in a bad Soil, that
<PB N="158" REF="165">
by Degrees fall off from their natural Reli&s;h, into Ta&s;ts altogether in&s;ipid or unwhol&s;ome; and the Calamities, like har&s;h Fruits, cultivated in a good Soil, and enriched by proper Grafts and Inocula|tions, till they &s;well with generous and delightful Juices.</P>
<P>There was &s;till a Third Circum&s;tance that oc|ca&s;ioned as great a Surprize to the Three Si&s;ters as either of the foregoing, when they di&s;covered &s;everal Ble&s;&s;ings and Calamities which had never been in either of the Tuns that &s;tood by the Throne of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and were neverthele&s;s as great Occa&s;ions of Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery as any there. The&s;e were that &s;purious Crop of Ble&s;&s;ings and Calamities which were never &s;own by the Hand of the Deity, but grow of them&s;elves out of the Fancies and Di&s;po&s;itions of Humane Creatures. Such are Dre&s;s, Titles, Place, Equipage, fal&s;e Shame and groundle&s;s Fear, with the like vain Imaginations that &s;hoot up in trifling, weak, and irre&s;olute Minds.</P>
<P>The De&s;tinies finding them&s;elves in &s;o great a Perplexity, concluded, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to execute the Commands that had been given them according to their fir&s;t Intention; for which Rea&s;on they agreed to throw all the Ble&s;|&s;ings and Calamities together into one large Ve&s;|&s;el, and in that Manner offer them up at the Feet of <HI>Jupiter.</HI></P>
<P>This was performed accordingly, the elde&s;t Si|&s;ter pre&s;enting her &s;elf before the Ve&s;&s;el, and in|troducing it with an Apology for what they had done.</P>
<Q>O <HI>Jupiter!</HI> (&s;ays &s;he) we have gathered to|gether all the Good and Evil, the Comforts and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Humane Life, which we thus pre|&s;ent before thee in one promi&s;cuous Heap. We be&s;eech thee that thou thy &s;elf wilt &s;ort them out for the future, as in thy Wi&s;dom thou &s;halt

think fit. For we acknowledge, that there is none be&s;ide thee that can judge what will occa|&s;ion Grief or Joy in the Heart of a Humane Creature, and what will prove a Ble&s;&s;ing or a Calamity to the Per&s;on on whom it is be|&s;towed.</Q>

<P>REading is to the Mind, what Exerci&s;e is to the Body. As by the one, Health is pre&s;er|ved, &s;trenthened and invigorated; by the other, Virtue (which is the Health of the Mind) is kept alive, cheri&s;hed and confirmed. But as Exerci&s;e becomes tedious and painful when we make u&s;e of it only as the Means of Health, &s;o Reading is apt to grow unea&s;y and burden&s;ome, when we apply our &s;elves to it only for our Improvement in Vir|tue. For this Rea&s;on, the Virtue which we ga|ther from a Fable, or an Allegory, is like the Health we get by Hunting; as we are engaged in an agreeable Pur&s;uit that draws us on with Plea&s;ure, and makes us in&s;en&s;ible of the Fatigues that ac|company it.</P>
<P>After this Preface, I &s;hall &s;et down a very beautiful Allegorical Fable out of the great Poet whom I mentioned in my la&s;t Paper, and whom it is very difficult to lay a&s;ide when one is enga|ged in the reading of him. And this I particularly de&s;ign for the U&s;e of &s;everal of my Fair Corre&s;pon|dents, who in their Letters have complained to
<PB N="160" REF="167">
me, that they have lo&s;t the Affections of their Husbands, and de&s;ire my Advice how to recover them.</P>
<P><HI>Juno,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Homer,</HI> &s;eeing her <HI>Jupiter</HI> &s;eated on the Top of Mount <HI>Ida,</HI> and knowing that he had conceived an Aver&s;ion to her, began to &s;tudy how &s;he &s;hould regain his Affections, and make her &s;elf amiable to him. With this Thought &s;he immedi|ately retired into her Chamber, where &s;he bathed her &s;elf in <HI>Ambro&s;ia,</HI> which gave her Per&s;on all its Beauty, and diffu&s;ed &s;o divine an Odor, as re|fre&s;h'd all Nature, and &s;weeten'd both Heaven and Earth. She let her immortal Tre&s;&s;es flow in the mo&s;t graceful Manner, and took a particular Care to dre&s;s her &s;elf in &s;everal Ornaments, which the Poet de&s;cribes at length, and which the Godde&s;s cho&s;e out as the mo&s;t proper to &s;et off her Per&s;on to the be&s;t Advantage. In the next Place, &s;he made a Vi&s;it to <HI>Venus,</HI> the Deity who pre&s;ides over Love, and begged of her, as a par|ticular Favour, that &s;he would lend her for a while tho&s;e Charms with which &s;he &s;ubdued the Hearts both of Gods and Men. For, &s;ays the Godde&s;s, I would make u&s;e of them to reconcile the Two Deities, who took Care of me in my Infancy, and who, at pre&s;ent, are at &s;o great a Variance, that they are e&s;tranged from each other's Bed. <HI>Venus</HI> was proud of an Opportunity of obliging &s;o great a Godde&s;s, and therefore made her a Pre&s;ent of the <HI>Ce&s;tus</HI> which &s;he u&s;ed to wear about her own Wa&s;t, with Advice to hide it in her Bo&s;om till &s;he had accompli&s;hed her In|tention. This <HI>Ce&s;tus</HI> was a fine Party-coloured Girdie, which, as <HI>Homer</HI> tells us, had all the At|tractions of the Sex wrought into it. The Four principal Figures in the Embroidery were Love, De&s;i e, Fondne&s;s of Speech, and Conver&s;ation, filled with that Sweetne&s;s and Complacency, which, &s;ays the Poet, in&s;en&s;ibly &s;teal away the Hearts of the wi&s;e&s;t Men.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="168">
<HI>Juno,</HI> after having made the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Prepa|rations, came as by Accident into the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> who is &s;aid to have been as much infla|med with her Beauty, as when he fir&s;t &s;tole to her Embraces without the Con&s;ent of their Parents. <HI>Juno,</HI> to cover her real Thoughts, told him as &s;he had told <HI>Venus,</HI> That &s;he was going to make a Vi&s;it to <HI>Oceanus</HI> and <HI>Tethys.</HI> He prevailed upon her to &s;tay with him, prote&s;ting to her, that &s;he appeared more amiable in his Eye, than ever any Mortal, Godde&s;s, or even her &s;elf, had appeared to him till that Day. The Poet then repre&s;ents him in &s;o great an Ardour, that (without going up to the Hou&s;e which had been built by the Hands of <HI>Vulcan</HI> according to <HI>Juno</HI>'s Direction) he threw a Golden Cloud over their Heads as they &s;ate upon the Top of Mount <HI>Ida,</HI> while the Earth beneath them &s;prung up in Lotus's, Saf|frons, Hyacinths, and a Bed of the &s;ofte&s;t Flowers for their Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>This clo&s;e Tran&s;lation of one of the fine&s;t Pa&s;|&s;ages in <HI>Homer,</HI> may &s;ugge&s;t abundance of In&s;tru|ction to a Woman who has a Mind to pre&s;erve or recal the Affection of her Husband. The Care of the Per&s;on, and the Dre&s;s, with the particular Blandi&s;hments woven in the <HI>Ce&s;tus,</HI> are &s;o plainly recommended by this Fable, and &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary in every Female who de&s;ires to plea&s;e, that they need no further Explanation. The Di&s;|cretion likewi&s;e in covering all Matrimonial Quar|rels from the Knowledge of others, is taught in the pretended Vi&s;it to <HI>Tethys,</HI> in the Speech where <HI>Juno</HI> addre&s;&s;es her &s;elf to <HI>Venus;</HI> as the cha&s;t and prudent Management of a Wife's Charms is inti|mated by the &s;ame Pretence for her appearing be|fore <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and by the Concealment of the <HI>Ce&s;tus</HI> in her Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave this Tale to the Con&s;ideration of &s;uch good Hou&s;ewives who are never well dre&s;|&s;ed but when they are Abroad, and think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="162" REF="169">
to appear more agreeable to all Men living than their Husbands: As al&s;o to tho&s;e prudent Ladies, who to avoid the Appearance of being over-fond, entertain their Husbands with Indiffe|rence, Aver&s;ion, &s;ullen Silence, or exa&s;perating Language.</P>

<P>Upon my coming Home la&s;t Night, I found a very hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent of Wine left for me, as a Ta&s;t <HI>of</HI> 216 <HI>Hog&s;heads which are to be put to Sale at</HI> 20 l. <HI>a Hog&s;head, at</HI> Garraway's <HI>Coffee-hou&s;e in</HI> Ex|change-Alley, <HI>on the</HI> 22<HI>d In&s;tant, at</HI> 3 <HI>in the After|noon, and to be ta&s;ted in Major</HI> Long<HI>'s Vaults from the</HI> 20<HI>th In&s;tant till the Time of Sale.</HI> This having been &s;ent to me with a De&s;ire that I would give my Judgment upon it, I immediately impannel|led a Jury of Men of nice Palates and &s;trong Heads, who being all of them very &s;crupulous, and unwilling to proceed ra&s;hly in a Matter of &s;o great Importance, refus'd to bring in their Ver|dict till Three in the Morning; at which Time the Foreman pronounc'd, as well as he was able, Extra&mdash;a&mdash;ordinary <HI>French</HI> Claret. For my own Part, as I love to con&s;ult my Pillow in all Points of Moment, I &s;lept upon it before I would give my Sentence, and this Morning confirmed the Verdict.</P>
<P>Having mentioned this Tribute of Wine, I mu&s;t give Notice to my Corre&s;pondents for the future, who &s;hall apply to me on this Occa&s;ion, That as I &s;hall decide nothing unadvi&s;edly in Matters of this Nature, I cannot pretend to give Judgment of a right good Liquor, without examining at lea&s;t Three Dozen Bottles of it. I mu&s;t at the &s;ame Time do my &s;elf the Ju&s;tice to let the World know, that I have re&s;i&s;ted great Temptations in this Kind; as it is well known to a Butcher in <HI>Clare-Market,</HI> who endeavoured to corrupt me with a Dozen and half of Marrow-Bones. I had

likewi&s;e a Bribe &s;ent me by a Fi&s;hmonger, con|&s;i&s;ting of a Collar of Brawn, and a Joll of Sal|mon; but not finding them excellent in their Kinds, I had the Integrity to eat them both up, without &s;peaking one Word of them. However, for the future, I &s;hall have an Eye to the Diet of this great City, and will recommend the be&s;t and mo&s;t whole&s;ome Food to them, if I receive the&s;e proper and re&s;pectful Notices from the Sel|lers, that it may not be &s;aid hereafter, my Rea|ders were better taught than fed.</P>

<P>HAVING intimated in my la&s;t Paper, that I de&s;ign to take under my In&s;pection the Diet of this great City, I &s;hall begin with a ve|ry earne&s;t and &s;erious Exhortation to all my well|di&s;po&s;ed Readers, that they would return to the Food of their Forefathers, and reconcile them|&s;elves to Beef and Mutton. This was the Diet which bred that hardy Race of Mortals who won the Fields of <HI>Cre&s;&s;y</HI> and <HI>Agincourt.</HI> I need not go up &s;o high as the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Guy</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who is well known to have eaten up a Dun Cow of his own killing. The Renown'd King <HI>Arthur</HI> is generally looked upon as the fir&s;t who ever &s;at down to a whole roa&s;ted Ox, (which was certainly the be&s;t Way to pre&s;erve the Gravy) and it is further added, that he and his Knights &s;at about it at his Round Table, and u&s;ually
<PB N="164" REF="171">
con&s;umed it to the very Bones before they would enter upon any Debate of Moment. The Black Prince was a profe&s;&s;ed Lover of the Bris|ket; not to mention the Hi&s;tory of the Surloin, or the In&s;titution of the Order of Beef-Eaters, which are all &s;o many evident and undeniable Marks of the great Re&s;pect which our Warlike Predece&s;&s;ors have paid to this excellent Food. The Tables of the ancient Gentry of this Nation were cover'd thrice a Day with hot Roa&s;t-Beef; and I am credibly informed, by an Antiquary who has &s;earched the Regi&s;ters, in which the Bills of Fare of the Court are recorded, that in|&s;tead of Tea and Bread and Butter, which have prevailed of late Years, the Maids of Honour in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time were allowed Three Rumps of Beef for their Breakfa&s;t. Mutton has likewi&s;e been in great Repute among our valiant Countrymen, but was formerly ob&s;erved to be the Food rather of Men of nice and delicate Ap|petites, than tho&s;e of &s;trong and robu&s;t Con&s;titu|tions. For which Rea&s;on, even to this Day, we u&s;e the Word Sheep-Biter as a Term of Reproach, as we do Beef-Eater in a re&s;pectful and honoura|ble Sen&s;e. As for the Fle&s;h of Lamb, Veal, Chicken, and other Animals under Age, they were the Invention of &s;ickly and degenerate Pa|lates, according to that whole&s;ome Remark of <HI>Daniel</HI> the Hi&s;torian, who takes Notice, That in all Taxes upon Provi&s;ions, during the Reigns of &s;everal of our Kings, there is nothing mentioned be&s;ides the Fle&s;h of &s;uch Fowl and Cattle as were arrived at their full Growth, and were ma|ture for Slaughter. The Common People of this Kingdom do &s;till keep up the Ta&s;te of their Ance&s;tors; and it is to this that we in a great Mea&s;ure owe the unparallelled Victories that have been gained in this Reign: For I would de&s;ire my Reader to con&s;ider, what Work our Country|men would have made at <HI>Blenheim</HI> and <HI>Ramil|lies,</HI>
<PB N="165" REF="172">
if they had been fed with Fricacies and Ra|gou&s;ts.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, we at pre&s;ent &s;ee the florid Complexion, the &s;trong Limb, and the hale Con&s;titution, are to be found chiefly among the meaner Sort of People, or in the wild Gentry, who have been educated among the Woods or Mountains. Whereas many great Families are in&s;en&s;ibly fallen off from the Athletick Con&s;ti|tution of their Progenitors, and are dwindled away into a pale, &s;ickly, &s;pindle-legged Gene|ration of Valetudinarians.</P>
<P>I may perhaps be thought extravagant in my Notion; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am apt to impute the Di&s;honours that &s;ometimes happen in great families to the inflaming kind of Diet which is &s;o much in Fa&s;hion. Many Di&s;hes can excite De&s;ire without giving Strength, and heat the Body without nouri&s;hing it; as Phy&s;icians ob|&s;erve, That the poore&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;pirited Blood is mo&s;t &s;ubject to Fevers. I look upon a <HI>French</HI> Ragou&s;t to be as pernicious to the Stomach as a Gla&s;s of Spirits; and when I have &s;een a young Lady &s;wallow all the In&s;tigations of high Soups, &s;ea&s;oned Sauces, and forced Meats, I have won|dered at the De&s;pair or tedious Sighing of her Lovers.</P>
<P>The Rules among the&s;e fal&s;e Delicates, are to be as Contradictory as they can be to Nature.</P>
<P>Without expecting the Return of Hunger, they eat for an Appetite, and prepare Di&s;hes not to al|lay, but to excite it.</P>
<P>They admit of nothing at their Tables in its natural Form, or without &s;ome Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>They are to eat every Thing before it comes in Sea&s;on, and to leave it off as &s;oon as it is good to be eaten.</P>
<P>They are not to approve any Thing that is agreeable to ordinary Palates; and nothing is to
<PB N="166" REF="173">
gratify their Sen&s;es, but what would offend tho&s;e of their Inferiors.</P>
<P>I remember I was la&s;t Summer invited to a Friend's Hou&s;e, who is a great Admirer of the <HI>French</HI> Cookery, and (as the Phra&s;e is) <HI>eats well.</HI> At our fitting down, I found the Table covered with a great Variety of Unknown Di&s;hes. I was mightily at a Lo&s;s to learn what they were, and therefore did not know where to help my &s;elf. That which &s;tood before me, I took to be a roa&s;ted Porcupine, however did not care for ask|ing Que&s;tions; and have &s;ince been informed, that it was only a larded Turkey. I afterwards pa&s;&s;ed my Eye over &s;everal Ha&s;hes, which I do not know the Names of to this Day; and hearing that they were Delicacies, did not think fit to meddle with them.</P>
<P>Among other Dainties, I &s;aw &s;omething like a Phea&s;ant, and therefore de&s;ired to be helped to a Wing of it; but to my great Surprize, my Friend told me it was a Rabbet, which is a &s;ort of Meat I never cared for. At la&s;t I di&s;covered, with &s;ome Joy, a Pig at the lower End of the Table, and begged a Gentleman that was near it to cut me a Piece of it. Upon which the Gentleman of the Hou&s;e &s;aid, with great Civility, I am &s;ure you will like the Pig, for it was whipped to Death. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I heard him with Horror, and could not eat of an Animal that had died &s;o tra|gical a Death. I was now in great Hunger and Confu&s;ion, when, methought, I &s;melled the a|greeable Savour of Roa&s;t Beef, but could not tell from which Di&s;h it aro&s;e, though I did not que|&s;tion but it lay di&s;gui&s;ed in one of them. Upon turning my Head, I &s;aw a noble Sirloin on the Side-Table &s;moaking in the mo&s;t delicious Man|ner. I had Recour&s;e to it more than once, and could not &s;ee, without &s;ome Indignation, that &s;ub&s;tantial <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Di&s;h bani&s;hed in &s;o igno|minious

<P>IT has often been a &s;olid Grief to me, when I have reflected on this glorious Nation, which is the Scene of publick Happine&s;s and Liberty, that there are &s;till Crowds of private Tyrants, again&s;t whom there neither is any Law now in Being, nor can there be invented any by the Wit of Man. The&s;e cruel Men are ill-natured Husbands. The Commerce in the Conjugal State is &s;o delicate, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;cribe Rules for the Conduct of it, &s;o as to fit Ten Thou&s;and name|le&s;s Plea&s;ures and Di&s;quietudes which ari&s;e to People in that Condition. But it is in this as in &s;ome other nice Ca&s;es, where touching upon the Malady tenderly, is half Way to the Cure; and there are &s;ome Faults which need only to be ob&s;erved to be amended. I am put into this Way of thinking by a late Conver&s;ation which I am going to give an Account of.</P>
<P>I made a Vi&s;it the other Day to a Family for which I have a great Honour, and found the Fa|ther, the Mother, and Two or Three of the younger Children, drop off de&s;ignedly to leave me alone with the elde&s;t Daughter, who was but a Vi&s;itant there as well as my &s;elf, and is the Wife of a Gentleman of a very fair Character in the World. As &s;oon as we were alone, I &s;aw her Eyes fall of Tears, and methought &s;he had much to &s;ay to me, for which &s;he wanted En|couragement. Madam, &s;aid I, you know I wi&s;h you all as well as any Friend you have: Speak freely what I &s;ee you are oppre&s;&s;ed with, and
<PB N="169" REF="176">
you may be &s;ure, if I cannot relieve your Di|&s;tre&s;s, you may at lea&s;t reap &s;o much pre&s;ent Ad|vantage, as &s;afely to give your &s;elf the Ea&s;e of uttering it. She immediately a&s;&s;umed the mo&s;t becoming Compo&s;ure of Countenance, and &s;poke as follows: <Q REND="inline">'It is an Aggravation of Affliction in a married Life, that there is a Sort of Guilt in communicating it: For which Rea|&s;on it is, that a Lady of your and my Ac|quaintance, in&s;tead of &s;peaking to you her &s;elf, de&s;ired me the next Time I &s;aw you, as you are a profe&s;&s;ed Friend to our Sex, to turn your Thoughts upon the reciprocal Complai&s;ance which is the Duty of a married State.' <P>'My Friend was neither in Fortune, Birth or Education, below the Gentleman whom &s;he has married. Her Per&s;on, her Age, and her Character, are al&s;o &s;uch as he can make no Ex|ception to. But &s;o it is, that from the Moment the Marriage-Ceremony was over, the Ob&s;e|quiou&s;ne&s;s of a Lover was turned into the Haughtine&s;s of a Ma&s;ter. All the kind En|deavours which &s;he u&s;es to plea&s;e him, are at be&s;t but &s;o many In&s;tances of her Duty. This In&s;olence takes away that &s;ecret Satisfaction, which does not only excite to Virtue, but al&s;o rewards it. It abates the Fire of a free and generous Love, and imbitters all the Plea&s;ures of a &s;ocial Life. The young Lady &s;poke all this with &s;uch an Air of Re&s;entment, as di&s;covered how nearly &s;he was concerned in the Di&s;tre&s;s.'</P></Q></P>
<P>When I ob&s;erved &s;he had done &s;peaking, Ma|dam, &s;aid I, the Affliction you mention is the greate&s;t that can happen in Humane Life, and I know but one Con&s;olation in it, if that be a Con|&s;olation, that the Calamity is a pretty general one. There is nothing &s;o common as for Men to enter into Marriage, without &s;o much as expect|ing to be happy in it. They &s;eem to propo&s;e to
<PB N="170" REF="177">
them&s;elves a few Holidays in the Beginning of it; after which they are to return at be&s;t to the u&s;ual Cour&s;e of their Life; and for ought they know, to con&s;tant Mi&s;ery and Unea&s;ine&s;s. From this fal&s;e Sen&s;e of the State they are going into, proceeds the immediate Coldne&s;s and Indiffe|rence, or Hatred and Aver&s;ion, which attend ordinary Marriages, or rather Bargains to coha|bit. Our Conver&s;ation was here interrupted by Company which came in upon us.</P>
<P>The Humour of affecting a &s;uperior Carriage, generally ri&s;es from a fal&s;e Notion of the Weak|ne&s;s of a Female Under&s;tanding in general, or an over-weaning Opinion that we have of our own: For when it proceeds from a natural Rug|gedne&s;s and Brutality of Temper, it is altoge|ther incorrigible, and not to be amended by Ad|monition. Sir <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> as I remember, lays it down as a Maxim, That no Marriage can be happy in which the Wife has no Opinion of her Husband's Wi&s;dom; but without Offence to &s;o great an Authority, I may venture to &s;ay, That a &s;ullen-wife Man is as bad as a good-na|tured Fool. Knowledge, &s;oftened with Compla|cency and good Breeding, will make a Man equal|ly beloved and re&s;pected; but when joined with a &s;evere, di&s;tant and un&s;ociable Temper, it creates rather Fear than Love. I who am a Batchelor, have no other Notion of Conjugal Tenderne&s;s, out what I learn from Books, and &s;hall there|fore produce Three Letters of <HI>Pliny,</HI> who was not only one of the greate&s;t, but the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">arned Men in the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. At the &s;ame Time I am very much a&s;hamed, that on &s;uch Occa&s;ions I am obliged to have Re|cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e to Heathen Authors, and &s;hall appeal to my Readers, if they would not think it a Mark of a narrow Education in a Man of Qua|lity to write &s;uch pa&s;&s;ionate Letters to any Wo|man but a Mi&s;tre&s;s.

<P>I Never was &s;o much offended at Bu&s;ine&s;s, as when it hindered me from going with you into the Country, or following you thither: For I more particularly wi&s;h to be with you at pre&s;ent, that I might be &s;en&s;ible of the Pro|gre&s;s you make in the Recovery of your Strength and Health; as al&s;o of the Enter|tainment and Diver&s;ions you can meet with in your Retirement. Believe me, it is an anxious State of Mind to live in Ignorance of what happens to tho&s;e whom we pa&s;&s;ionately love. I am not only in Pain for your Ab&s;ence, but al|&s;o for your Indi&s;po&s;ition.

<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive how much I lan|gui&s;h for you in your Ab&s;ence; the tender Love I bear you, is the chief Cau&s;e of this my Unea&s;ine&s;s, which is &s;till the more in&s;upporta|ble, becau&s;e Ab&s;ence is wholly a new Thing to us. I lie awake mo&s;t Part of the Night in thinking of you, and &s;everal Times of the Day go as naturally to your Apartment, as if you were there to receive me; but when I mi&s;s you, I come away dejected, out of Humour, and like a Man that had &s;uffered a Repul&s;e. There is but one Part of the Day in which I am relieved from this Anxiety, and that is when I am engaged in Publick Affairs.</P>

<P>I Have received the following Letter upon the Subject of my la&s;t Paper. The Writer of it tells me, I there &s;poke of Marriage as one that knows it only by Speculation, and for that Rea|&s;on he &s;ends me his Sen&s;e of it, as drawn from Experience.</P>

<P>I Have read your Paper of this Day, and think you have done the Nuptial State a great deal of Ju&s;tice in the Authority you give us of <HI>Pliny,</HI> who&s;e Letters to his Wife you have there tran|&s;lated: But give me Leave to tell you, That it is impo&s;&s;ible for you, that are a Batchelor, to have &s;o ju&s;t a Notion of this Way of Life, as
<PB N="174" REF="181">
to touch the Affections of your Readers in a Particular, wherein every Man's own Heart &s;ugge&s;ts more than the nice&s;t Ob&s;erver can form to him&s;elf without Experience. I therefore, who am an old married Man, have &s;at down to give you an Account of the Matter from my own Knowledge, and the Ob&s;ervations which I have made upon the Conduct of others in that mo&s;t agreeable or wretched Condition.</P>
<P>It is very commonly ob&s;erved, That the mo&s;t &s;mart Pangs whech we meet with are in the Beginning of Wedlock, which proceed from Ignorance of each others Humour, and Want of Prudence to make Allowances for a Change from the mo&s;t careful Re&s;pect, to the mo&s;t un|bounded Familiarity. Hence it ari&s;es, That Trifles are commonly Occa&s;ions of the greate&s;t Anxiety; for Contradiction being a Thing wholly unu&s;ual between a new married Couple, the &s;malle&s;t In&s;tance of it is taken for the highe&s;t Injury; and it very &s;eldom happens, that the Man is &s;low enough in a&s;&s;uming the Character of an Husband, or the Woman quick enough in conde&s;cending to that of a Wife. It imme|diately follows, That they think they have all the Time of their Court&s;hip been talking in Masks to each other, and therefore begin to act like di&s;appointed People. <HI>Philander</HI> finds <HI>Delia</HI> ill-natur'd and impertinent; and <HI>Delia, Philander</HI> &s;urly and incon&s;tant.</P>
<P>I have known a fond Couple quarrel in the very Honey-moon about cutting up a Tart: Nay, I could name Two, who after having had Seven Children, fell out and parted Beds upon the boiling of a Leg of Mutton. My very next Neighbours have not &s;poke to one another the&s;e Three Days, becau&s;e they differ'd in their Opi|nions, whether the Clock &s;hould &s;tand by the Window, or over the Chimney. It may &s;eem &s;trange to you, who are not a married Man,
<PB N="175" REF="182">
when I tell you, how the lea&s;t Trifle can &s;trike a Woman dumb for a Week together. But if you ever enter into this State, you will find, that the Soft Sex as often expre&s;s their Anger by an ob&s;tinate Silence, as by an ungovernable Cla|mour.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e indeed who begin this Cour&s;e of Life without Jars at their &s;etting out, arrive with|in few Months at a Pitch of Benevolence and Affection, of which the mo&s;t perfect Friend|&s;hip is but a feint Re&s;emblance. As in the un|fortunate Marriage, the mo&s;t minute and in|different Things are Objects of the &s;harpe&s;t Re|&s;entment; &s;o in an happy One, they are Occa|&s;ions of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Satisfaction. For what does not oblige in one we love? What does not offend in one we di&s;like? For the&s;e Rea&s;ons I take it for a Rule, That in Marriage, the chief Bu&s;ine&s;s is to acquire a Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in Favour of each other. They &s;hould con&s;i+der one another's Words and Actions with a &s;ecret Indulgence: There &s;hould be always an inward Fondne&s;s pleading for each other, &s;uch as may add new Beauties to every Thing that is excellent, give Charms to what is indiffe|rent, and cover every Thing that is defective. For want of this kind Propen&s;ity and Bia&s;s of Mind, the married Pair often take Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">as ill of each other, which no one el&s;e would take Notice of in either of them.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t unhappy Circum&s;tance of all is, where each Party is always laying up Fuel for Di&s;&s;ention, and gathering together a Maga|zine of Provocations to exa&s;perate each other with when they are out of Humour. The&s;e People in common Di&s;cour&s;e make no Scruple to let tho&s;e who are by know they are quarrelling with one another, and think they are di&s;creet enough, if they conceal from the Company the Matters which they are hinting at.

a Week ago, I was entertained for a whole Dinner with a my&s;terious Conver&s;ation of this Nature; out of which I could learn no more, than that the Husband and Wife were angry at one another. We had no &s;ooner &s;ate down, but &s;ays the Gentleman of the Hou&s;e, in order to rai&s;e Di&s;cour&s;e, I thought <HI>Margarita</HI> &s;ung extremely well la&s;t Night. Upon this, &s;ays the Lady, looking as pale as A&s;hes, I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he had Cherry-coloured Ribands on. No, an|&s;wered the Husband, with a Flu&s;h in his Face, but &s;he had Laced Shoes. I look upon it, that a Stander-by on &s;uch Occa&s;ions has as much Rea&s;on to be out of Countenance as ei|ther of the Combatants. To turn off my Con|fu&s;ion, and &s;eem regardle&s;s of what had pa&s;&s;ed, I de&s;ired the Servant who attended to give me the Vinegar, which unluckily created a new Dialogue of Hints; for as far as I could gather by the &s;ub&s;equent Di&s;cour&s;e, they had di&s;&s;ented the Day before about the Preference of Elder to Wine-Vinegar. In the Mid&s;t of their Di&s;|cour&s;e, there appeared a Di&s;h of Chickens and Sparagra&s;s, when the Husband &s;eemed di&s;|po&s;ed to lay a&s;ide all Di&s;putes; and looking upon her with a great deal of good Nature, &s;aid, Pray, my Dear, will you help my Friend to a Wing of the Fowl that lies next you, for I think it looks extremely well. The Lady, in&s;tead of an&s;wering him, addre&s;&s;ing her &s;elf to me, Pray, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, do you in <HI>Surrey</HI> reckon the white or the black-legged Fowls the be&s;t? I found the Husband changed Co|lour at the Que&s;tion; and before I could an|&s;wer, asked me, Whether we did not call Hops Broom in our Country? I quickly found, they did not ask Que&s;tions &s;o much out of Curio&s;ity as Anger: For which Rea&s;on I thought fit to keep my Opinion to my &s;elf, and, as an ho|ne&s;t Man ought, (when he &s;ees Two Friends in
<PB N="177" REF="184">
Warmth with each other) I took the fir&s;t Op|portunity I could to leave them by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Sir, I have laid before you only &s;mall Incidents, which are &s;eemingly frivial; but take it from a Man who am very well ex|perienced in this State, they are principally Evils of this Nature which make Marriages un|happy. At the &s;ame Time, that I may do Ju&s;tice to this excellent In&s;titution, I mu&s;t own to you, there are un&s;peakable Plea&s;ures which are as little regarded in the Computation of the Advantages of Marriage, as the others are in the u&s;ual Survey that is made of its Mis|fortunes.</P>
<P><HI>Lovemore</HI> and his Wife live together in the happy Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of each other's Hearts, and by that Means have no indifferent Moments, but their whole Life is one continued Scene of Delight. Their Pa&s;&s;ion for each other commu|nicates a certain Satisfaction, like that which they them&s;elves are in, to all that approach them. When &s;he enters the Place where he is, you &s;ee a Plea&s;ure which he cannot conceal, nor he or any one el&s;e de&s;cribe. In &s;o con&s;um|mate an Affection, the very Pre&s;ence of the Per&s;on beloved, has the Effect of the mo&s;t a+greeable Conver&s;ation. Whether they have Matter to talk of or not, they enjoy the Plea|&s;ures of Society, and at the &s;ame Time the Free|dom of Solitude. Their ordinary Life is to be preferred to the happie&s;t Moments of other Lovers. In a Word, they have each of them great Merit, live in the E&s;teem of all who know them, and &s;eem but to comply with the Opinions of their Friends, in the ju&s;t Value they have for each other.</P>

her Time in making her &s;elf look more ad|vantagiou&s;ly what &s;he really is, but endeavours to be as much another Creature as &s;he po&s;&s;ibly can. Whether this happens, becau&s;e they &s;tay &s;o long, and attend their Work &s;o diligently, that they forget the Faces and Per&s;ons which they fir&s;t &s;ate down with, or whatever it is, they &s;el|dom ri&s;e from the Toilet the &s;ame Women they appeared when they began to dre&s;s. What Jewel can the Charming <HI>Cleora</HI> place in her Ears, that can plea&s;e her Beholders &s;o much as her Eyes? The Clu&s;ter of Diamonds upon the Brea&s;t can add no Beauty to the fair Che&s;t of Ivory which &s;upports it. It may indeed tempt a Man to &s;teal a Woman, but never to love her. Let <HI>Thale&s;tris</HI> change her &s;elf into a Motly Party-coloured Animal: The Pearl Neck-lace, the Flowered Stomacher, the Artificial No&s;egay, and Shaded Furbelow, may be of U&s;e to attract the Eye of the Beholder, and turn it from the Im|perfections of her Features and Shape. But if Ladies will take my Word for it, (and as they dre&s;s to plea&s;e Men, they ought to con&s;ult our Fancy rather than their own in this Particular) I can a&s;&s; re them, there is nothing touches our Imagination &s;o much as a beautiful Woman in a plain Dre&s;s. There might be more agreeable Ornaments found in our own Manufacture, than any that ri&s;e out of the Looms of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>This, I know, is a very har&s;h Doctrine to Wo|man-kind, who are carried away with every Thing that is &s;howy, and with what delights the Eye, more than any other Species of Living Creatures what&s;oever. Were the Minds of the Sex laid open, we &s;hould find the chief Idea in one to be a Tippet, in another a Muff, in a Third a Fan, and in a Fourth a Fardingal. The Me|mory of an old Vi&s;iting-Lady is &s;o filled with Gloves, Silks, and Ribands, that I can look upon it as nothing el&s;e but a Toy-&s;hop. A Matron of
<PB N="180" REF="187">
my Acqaintance complaining of her Daughter's Vanity, was ob&s;erving, that &s;he had all of a &s;ud|den held up her Head higher than ordinary, and taken an Air that &s;howed a &s;ecret Satisfaction in her &s;elf, mixed with a Scorn of others. I did not know, &s;ays my Friend, what to make of the Carriage of this Fanta&s;tical Girl, till I was in|formed by her elder Si&s;ter, that &s;he had a Pair of &s;triped Garters on. This odd Turn of Mind often makes the Sex unhappy, and di&s;po&s;es them to be &s;truck with every Thing that makes a Show, however trifling and &s;uperficial.</P>
<P>Many a Lady has fetched a Sigh at the To&s;s of a Wig, and been ruined by the Tapping of a Snuff box. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe all the Execution that was done by the Shoulder-Knot while that Fa&s;hion prevailed, or to reckon up all the Virgins that have fallen a Sacrifice to a Pair of fringed Gloves. A &s;incere Heart has not made half &s;o many Conque&s;ts as an open Wa&s;t|coat; and I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee an able Head make &s;o good a Figure in a Woman's Company as a Pair of Red Heels. A <HI>Grecian</HI> Hero, when he was asked whether he could play upon the Lute, thought he had made a very good Reply when he an&s;wered, No, but I can make a great City of a little One. Notwith&s;tanding his boa&s;ted Wi&s;dom, I appeal to the Heart of any Toa&s;t in Town, whether &s;he would not think the Luta|nist preferable to the State&s;man. I do not &s;peak this out of any Aver&s;ion that I have to the Sex: On the contrary, I have always had a Tender|ne&s;s for them; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it troubles me very much, to &s;ee the Generality of them place their Affections on improper Objects, and give up all the Plea&s;ures of Life for Gugaws and Trifles.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Margery Bicker&s;taff,</HI> my great Aunt, had a Thou&s;and Pounds to her Portion, which our Fa|mily was de&s;irous of keeping among them&s;elves,
<PB N="181" REF="188">
and therefore u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible Means to turn off her Thoughts from Marriage. The Method they took, was, in any Time of Danger to throw a new Gown or Petticoat in her Way. When &s;he was about Twenty five Years of Age, &s;he fell in Love with a Man of an agreeable Temper, and equal Fortune, and would certainly have married him, had not my Grandfather, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> dre&s;&s;ed her up in a Suit of flowered Sattin; upon which, &s;he &s;et &s;o immoderate a Value upon her &s;elf, that the Lover was contemned and di&s;carded. In the Fortieth Year of her Age, &s;he was again &s;mitten, but very luckily transferred her Pa&s;|&s;ion to a Tippet, which was pre&s;ented to her by another Relation who was in the Plot. This, with a white Sar&s;enet Hood, kept her &s;afe in the Family till Fifty. About Sixty, which gene|rally produces a Kind of latter Spring in amo|rous Con&s;titutions, my Aunt <HI>Margery</HI> had again a Colt's-Tooth in her Head, and would certainly have eloped from the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, had not her Brother <HI>Simon,</HI> who was a wi&s;e Man, and a Scho|lar, advi&s;ed to dre&s;s her in Cherry-coloured Ri|bands, which was the only Expedient that could have been found out by the Wit of Man to pre|&s;erve the Thou&s;and Pounds in our Family, Part of which I enjoy at this Time.</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e puts me in Mind of an Hu|mori&s;t mentioned by <HI>Horace,</HI> called <HI>Eutrapelus,</HI> who, when he de&s;igned to do a Man a Mi&s;chief, made him a Pre&s;ent of a gay Suit; and brings to my Memory another Pa&s;&s;age of the &s;ame Author, when he de&s;cribes the mo&s;t ornamental Dre&s;s that a Woman can appear in with Two Words, <HI>Simplex Munditiis,</HI> which I have quoted for the Benefit of my Female Readers.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>March 29.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>A Man who confines his Speculations to the Time pre&s;ent, has but a very narrow Pro|vince to employ his Thoughts in. For this Rea|&s;on, Per&s;ons of &s;tudious and contemplative Na|tures often entertain them&s;elves with the Hi&s;tory of pa&s;t Ages, or rai&s;e Schemes and Conjectures upon Futurity. For my own Part, I love to range through that Half of Eternity which is &s;till to come, rather than look on that which is already run out; becau&s;e I know I have a real Share and Intere&s;t in the one, whereas all that was tran&s;|acted in the other, can be only Matter of Cu|rio&s;ity to me.</P>
<P>Upon this Account, I have been always very much delighted with meditating on the Soul's Immortality, and in reading the &s;everal Notions which the wi&s;e&s;t of Men, both ancient and mo|dern, have entertained on that Subject. What the Opinions of the greate&s;t Philo&s;ophers have been, I have &s;everal times hinted at, and &s;hall give an Account of them from Time to Time as Occa&s;ion requires. It may likewi&s;e be worth while to con&s;ider, what Men of the mo&s;t exalted Genius, and elevated Imagination, have thought of this Matter. Among the&s;e, <HI>Homer</HI> &s;tands up as a Prodigy of Mankind, that looks down upon the re&s;t of Humane Creatures as a Species beneath him. Since he is the mo&s;t ancient Hea|then
<PB N="183" REF="190">
Author, we may gue&s;s from his Relation, what were the common Opinions in his Time concerning the State of the Soul after Death.</P>
<P><HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> he tells us, made a Voyage to the Re|gions of the Dead, in order to con&s;ult <HI>Tire&s;ias</HI> how he &s;hould return to his own Country, and recommend him&s;elf to the Favour of the Gods. The Poet &s;carce introduces a &s;ingle Per&s;on, who doth not &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome u&s;eful Precept to his Rea|der, and de&s;igns his De&s;cription of the Dead for the Amendment of the Living.</P>
<P><HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> after having made a very plenteous Sa|crifice, &s;ate him down by the Pool of Holy Blood, which attracted a prodigious A&s;&s;embly of Gho&s;ts of all Ages and Conditions, that hovered about the Hero, and fea&s;ted upon the Steams of his Oblation. The fir&s;t he knew, was the Shade of <HI>Elpenor,</HI> who, to &s;how the Activity of a Spirit a|bove that of Body, is repre&s;ented as arrived there long before <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Winds and Seas had contributed all their Force to ha&s;ten his Voyage thither. This <HI>Elpenor,</HI> to in&s;pire the Reader with a Dete&s;tation of Drunkenne&s;s, and at the &s;ame Time with a religious Care of doing proper Honours to the Dead, de&s;cribes him&s;elf as having broken his Neck in a Debauch of Wine; and begs <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> that for the Repo&s;e of his Soul, he would build a Monument over him, and per|form Funeral Rites to his Memory. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> with great Sorrow of Heart promi&s;es to fulfil his Re|que&s;t, and is immediately diverted to an Object much more moving than the former. The Gho&s;t of his own Mother <HI>Anticlea,</HI> whom he &s;till thought living, appears to him among the Multi|tude of Shades that &s;urrounded him, and &s;its down at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from him by the Lake of Blood, without &s;peaking to him, or knowing who he was. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> was exceedingly troubled at the Sight, and could not forbear weeping as he look'd upon her: But being all along &s;et forth as
<PB N="184" REF="191">
a Pattern of con&s;ummate Wi&s;dom, he makes his Affection give Way to Prudence; and therefore, upon his &s;eeing <HI>Tire&s;ias,</HI> does not reveal him&s;elf to his Mother, till he had con&s;ulted that great Prophet, who was the Occa&s;ion of this his De|&s;cent into the Empire of the Dead. <HI>Tire&s;ias</HI> ha|ving cautioned him to keep him&s;elf and his Com|panions free from the Guilt of Sacrilege, and to pay his Devotions to all the Gods, promi&s;es him a &s;afe Return to his Kingdom and Family, and a happy old Age in the Enjoyment of them.</P>
<P>The Poet having thus with great Art kept the Curio&s;ity of the Reader in Su&s;pence, repre&s;ents his wi&s;e Man, after the Di&s;patch of his Bu&s;ine&s;s with <HI>Tire&s;ias,</HI> as yielding him&s;elf up to the Calls of natural Affection, and making him&s;elf known to his Mother. Her Eyes are no &s;ooner opened, but &s;he cries out in Tears, <HI>Oh my Son!</HI> and en|quires into the Occa&s;ions that brought him thi|ther, and the Fortune that attended him.</P>
<P><HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> on the other Hand de&s;ires to know, what the Sickne&s;s was that had &s;ent her into tho&s;e Regions, and the Condition in which &s;he had left his Father, his Son, and more particu|larly his Wife. She tells him, they were all Three incon&s;olable for his Ab&s;ence; <HI>and as for my &s;elf,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>That was the Sickne&s;s of which I died. My Impatience for your Return, my Anxiety for your Welfare, and my Fondne&s;s for my Dear</HI> Uly&s;&s;es, <HI>were the only Di&s;tempers that prey'd upon my Life, and &s;eparated my Soul from my Body. Uly&s;&s;es</HI> was melted with the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions of Ten|derne&s;s, and Thrice endeavoured to catch the Apparition in his Arms, that he might hold his Mother to his Bo&s;om and weep over her.</P>
<P>This gives the Poet Occa&s;ion to de&s;cribe the Notion the Heathens at that Time had of an un|bodied Soul, in the Excu&s;e which the Mother makes for &s;eeming to withdraw her &s;elf from her Son's Embraces. <HI>The Soul,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>is compo&s;ed</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="192">
<HI>neither of Bones, Fle&s;h, nor Sinews, but leaves be|hind her all tho&s;e Incumbrances of Mortality to be con&s;umed on the Funeral Pile. As &s;oon as &s;he has thus ca&s;t her Burthen, &s;he makes her E&s;cape, and flies away from it like a Dream.</HI></P>
<P>When this melancholy Conver&s;ation is at an End, the Poet draws up to View as charming a Vi&s;ion as could enter into Man's Imagination. He de&s;cribes the next who appeared to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> to have been the Shades of the fine&s;t Women that had ever lived upon the Earth, and who had ei|ther been the Daughters of Kings, the Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of Gods, or Mothers of Heroes, &s;uch as <HI>Antiope, Alemena, Leda, Ariadne, Iphimedia, Eri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hyle,</HI> and &s;everal others, of whom he gives a Catalogue, with a &s;hort Hi&s;tory of their Adventures. The beautiful A&s;&s;embly of Apparitions were all ga|thered together about the Blood: Each of them, &s;ays <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> (as a gentle Satyr upon Female Va|nity) <HI>giving me an Account of her Birth and Fa|mily.</HI> This Scene of extraordinary Women, &s;eems to have been de&s;igned by the Poet as a Lecture of Mortality to the whole Sex, and to put them in Mind of what they mu&s;t expect, notwith&s;tand|ing the greate&s;t Perfections, and highe&s;t Honours, they can arrive at.</P>
<P>The Circle of Beauties at length di&s;appeared, and was &s;ucceeded by the Shades of &s;everal <HI>Gre|cian</HI> Heroes who had been engaged with <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in the Siege of <HI>Troy.</HI> The fir&s;t that approached was <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> the Generali&s;&s;imo of that great Expedition, who at the Appearance of his old Friend wept very bitterly, and without &s;aying any Thing to him, endeavoured to gra&s;p him by the Hand. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> who was much moved at the Sight, pour'd out a Flood of Tears, and ask'd him the Occa&s;ion of his Death, which <HI>Agamem|non</HI> related to him in all its Tragical Circum&s;tan|ces; how he was murthered at a Banquet by the Contrivance of his own Wife, in Confederacy
<PB N="186" REF="193">
with her Adulterer: From whence he takes Oc+ca&s;ion to reproach the whole Sex, after a Man+ner which would be inexcu&s;able in a Man who had not been &s;o great a Sufferer by them. <HI>My Wife</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>has di&s;graced all the Women that &s;hall ever be born into the World, even tho&s;e who hereafter &s;hall be innocent: Take Care how you grow too fond of your Wife. Never tell her all you know. If you reveal &s;ome Things to her, be &s;ure you keep others concealed from her. You indeed have nothing to fear from your</HI> Penelope, <HI>&s;he will not u&s;e you as my Wife has treated me; however, take Care how you tru&s;t a Woman.</HI> The Poet, in this and other In&s;tances, according to the Sy&s;tem of many Hea|then as well as Chri&s;tian Philo&s;ophers, &s;hows, how Anger, Revenge, and other Habits which the Soul had contracted in the Body, &s;ub&s;i&s;t and grow in it under its State of Separation.</P>
<P>I am extremely plea&s;ed with the Companions which the Poet in the next De&s;cription a&s;&s;igns to <HI>Achilles. Achilles</HI> (&s;ays the Hero) <HI>came up to me with</HI> Patroclus <HI>and</HI> Antilochus. By which we may &s;ee that it was <HI>Homer</HI>'s Opinion, and proba|bly that of the Age he lived in, that the Friend|&s;hips which are made among the Living, will likewi&s;e continue among the Dead. <HI>Achilles</HI> en|quires after the Welfare of his Son, and of his Father, with a Fiercene&s;s of the &s;ame Character that <HI>Homer</HI> has every where expre&s;&s;ed in the Actions of his Life. The Pa&s;&s;age relating to his Son is &s;o extremely beautiful, that I mu&s;t not omit it. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> after having de&s;cribed him as wi&s;e in Council, and active in War, and mentioned the Foes whom he had &s;lain in Battle, adds an Ob&s;ervation that he him&s;elf had made of his Be|haviour whil&s;t he lay in the Wooden Hor&s;e. <HI>Mo&s;t of the Generals</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>that were with us, either wept or trembled: As for your Son, I neither &s;aw him wipe a Tear from his Cheeks, or change his Countenance. On the contrary, he would often lay</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="194">
<HI>his Hand upon his Sword, or gra&s;p his Spear, as impatient to employ them again&s;t the</HI> Trojans. He then informs his Father of the great Honour and Rewards which he had purcha&s;ed before <HI>Troy,</HI> and of his Return from it without a Wound. The Shade of <HI>Achilles,</HI> &s;ays the Poet, was &s;o plea&s;ed with the Account he received of his Son, that he enquired no further, but &s;talked away with more than ordinary Maje&s;ty over the green Meadow that lay before them.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Circum&s;tance of a decea&s;ed Father's rejoicing in the Behaviour of his Son, is very finely contrived by <HI>Homer,</HI> as an Incentive to Virtue, and made u&s;e of by none that I know be&s;ides him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The De&s;cription of <HI>Ajax,</HI> which follows, and his refu&s;ing to &s;peak to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> who had won the Armour of <HI>Achilles</HI> from him, and by that Means occa&s;ioned his Death, is admired by every one that reads it. When <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> relates the Sullen|ne&s;s of his Deportment, and con&s;iders the Great|ne&s;s of the Hero, he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with ge|nerous and noble Sentiments. <HI>Oh! that I had never gained a Prize which co&s;t the Life of &s;o brave a Man as</HI> Ajax! <HI>Who, for the Beauty of his Per&s;on, and Greatne&s;s of his Actions, was inferior to none but the Divine</HI> Achilles. The &s;ame noble Con|de&s;cen&s;ion, which never dwells but in truly great Minds, and &s;uch as <HI>Homer</HI> would repre&s;ent that of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to have been, di&s;covers it &s;elf likewi&s;e in the Speech which he made to the Gho&s;t of <HI>Ajax</HI> on that Occa&s;ion. <HI>Oh</HI> Ajax! &s;ays he, <HI>Will you keep your Re&s;entments even after Death? What De&s;tructions hath this fatal Armour brought upon the</HI> Greeks, <HI>by robbing them of you, who were their Bulwark and Defence?</HI> Achilles <HI>is not more bitter|ly lamented among us than you. Impute not then your Death to any one but</HI> Jupiter, <HI>who out of his Anger to the</HI> Greeks, <HI>took you away from among them: Let me entreat you to approach me; re&s;train</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="195">
<HI>the Fiercene&s;s of your Wrath, and the Greatne&s;s of your Soul, and bear what I have to &s;ay to you. Ajax,</HI> without making a Reply, turned his Back upon him, and retired into a Crowd of Gho&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> after all the&s;e Vi&s;ions, took a View of tho&s;e impious Wretches who lay in Tortures for the Crimes they had committed upon the Earth, whom he de&s;cribes under all the Varieties of Pain, as &s;o many Marks of Divine Vengeance, to deter others from following their Example. He then tells us, That notwith&s;tanding he had a great Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Hero's that lived in the Ages before him, the Gho&s;ts began to ga|ther about him in &s;uch prodigious Multitudes, and with &s;uch a Confu&s;ion of Voices, that his Heart trembled as he &s;aw him&s;elf amid&s;t &s;o great a Scene of Horrors. He adds, That he was afraid le&s;t &s;ome hideous Spectre &s;hould ap|pear to him, that might terrify him to Di&s;traction; and therefore withdrew in Time.</P>
<P>I que&s;tion not but my Reader will be plea&s;ed with this De&s;cription of a future State, repre|&s;ented by &s;uch a noble and fruitful Imagination, that had nothing to direct it be&s;ides the Light of Nature, and the Opinions of a dark and ig|norant Age.</P>

<P>I Have heard of a very valuable Picture, where|in all the Painters of the Age in which it was drawn, are repre&s;ented &s;itting together in a Cir|cle,
<PB N="189" REF="196">
and joining in a Con&s;ort of Mu&s;ick. Each of them plays upon &s;uch a particular In&s;trument as is the mo&s;t &s;uitable to his Character, and ex|pre&s;&s;es that Style and Manner of Painting which is peculiar to him. The famous Cupola-Painter of tho&s;e Times, to &s;how the Grandeur and Bold|ne&s;s of his Figures, hath a Horn in his Mouth, which he &s;eems to wind with great Strength and Force. On the contrary, an eminent Arti&s;t, who wrought up his Pictures with the greate&s;t Accu|racy, and gave them all tho&s;e delicate Touches which are apt to plea&s;e the nice&s;t Eye, is repre|&s;ented as tuning a Theorbo. The &s;ame Kind of Humour runs through the whole Piece.</P>
<P>I have often from this Hint imagined to my &s;elf, that different Talents in Di&s;cour&s;e might be &s;hadowed out after the &s;ame Manner by different Kinds of Mu&s;ick; and that the &s;everal conver&s;a|ble Parts of Mankind in this great City, might be ca&s;t into proper Characters and Divi&s;ions, as they re&s;emble &s;everal In&s;truments that are in U&s;e among the Ma&s;ters of Harmony. Of the&s;e therefore in their Order, and Fir&s;t of the Drum.</P>
<P>Your Drums are the Blu&s;terers in Conver&s;ation, that with a loud Laugh, unnatural Mirth, and a Torrent of Noi&s;e, domineer in publick A&s;&s;em|blies, over-bear Men of Sen&s;e, &s;tun their Com|panions, and fill the Place they are in with a rat|ling Sound, that hath &s;eldom any Wit, Humour, or good Breeding in it. The Drum notwith|&s;tanding, by this boi&s;terous Vivacity, is very proper to impo&s;e upon the Ignorant; and in Conver&s;ation with Ladies, who are not of the fine&s;t Ta&s;t, often pa&s;&s;es for a Man of Mirth and Wit, and for wonderful plea&s;ant Company. I need not ob&s;erve, that the Emptine&s;s of the Drum very much contributes to its Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Lute is a Character directly oppo&s;ite to the Drum, that &s;ounds very finely by it &s;elf, or
<PB N="190" REF="197">
in a very &s;mall Con&s;ort. Its Notes are exqui&s;ite|ly &s;weet, and very low, ea&s;ily drowned in a Multitude of In&s;truments, and even lo&s;t among a few, unle&s;s you give a particular Attention to it. A Lute is &s;eldom heard in a Company of more then Five, whereas a Drum will &s;how it &s;elf to Advantage in an A&s;&s;embly of Five hun|dred. The Lutani&s;ts therefore are Men of a fine Genius, uncommon Reflection, great Affability, and e&s;teemed chiefly by Per&s;ons of a good Ta&s;t, who are the only proper Judges of &s;o delightful and &s;oft a Melody.</P>
<P>The Trumpet is an In&s;trument that has in it no Compa&s;s of Mu&s;ick, or Variety of Sound, but is notwith&s;tanding very agreeable, &s;o long as it keeps within its Pitch. It has not above Four or Five Notes, which are however very plea&s;ing, and capable of exqui&s;ite Turns and Modulations. The Gentlemen who fall under this Denomina|tion, are your Men of the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable Edu|cation and refined Breeding, who have learned a certain Smoothne&s;s of Di&s;cour&s;e, and Sprightli|ne&s;s of Air, from the polite Company they have kept; but at the &s;ame Time have &s;hallow Parts, weak Judgments, and a &s;hort Reach of Under|&s;tanding: A Playhou&s;e, a Drawing-Room, a Ball, a Vi&s;iting-Day, or a Ring at <HI>Hide-Park,</HI> are the few Notes they are Ma&s;ters of, which they touch upon in all Conver&s;ations. The Trumpet how|ever is a nece&s;&s;ary In&s;trument about a Court, and a proper Enlivener of a Con&s;ort, tho' of no great Harmony by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Violins are the lively, forward, importunate Wits, that di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by the Flou|ri&s;hes of Imagination, Sharpne&s;s of Repartee, Glances of Satyr, and bear away the upper Part in every Con&s;ort. I cannot however but ob&s;erve, That when a Man is not di&s;pos'd to hear Mu&s;ick, there is not a more di&s;agreeable Sound in Har|mony than that of a Violin.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="198">
There is another Mu&s;ical In&s;trument, which is more frequent in this Nation than any other; I mean your Ba&s;s-Viol, which grumbles in the Bottom of the Con&s;ort, and with a &s;urly Ma&s;cu|line Sound &s;trengthens the Harmony, and tem|pers the Sweetne&s;s of the &s;everal In&s;truments that play along with it. The Ba&s;s-Viol is an In|&s;trument of a quiet different Nature to the Trum|pet, and may &s;ignifie Men of rough Sen&s;e, and un|poli&s;h'd Parts, who do not love to hear them&s;elves talk, but &s;ometimes break out with an agreeable Bluntle&s;s, unexpected Wit, and &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ly Plea&s;antries, to the no &s;mall Diver&s;ion of their Friends and Companions. In &s;hort, I look upon every &s;en|&s;ible true-born <HI>Britain</HI> to be naturally a Ba&s;s-Viol.</P>
<P>As for your Rural Wits, who talk with great Eloquence and Alacrity of Foxes, Hounds, Hor|&s;es, Quick&s;et Hedges, and Six-Bar Gates, double Ditches, and broken Necks, I am in Doubt, whether I &s;hould give them a Place in the con|ver&s;able World. However, if they will content them&s;elves with being rai&s;ed to the Dignity of Hunting-Horns, I &s;hall de&s;ire for the future that they may be known by that Name.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not here omit the Bagpipe Species, that will entertain you from Morning to Night with the Repetition of a few Notes, which are play'd over and over, with the perpetual Humming of a Drone running underneath them. The&s;e are your dull, heavy, tedious Story Tellers, the Load and Burthen of Conver&s;ations, that &s;et up for Men of Importance, by knowing &s;ecret Hi&s;tory, and giving an Account of Tran&s;actions, that whether they ever pa&s;&s;ed in the World or not, doth not &s;ignify an Halfpenny to its In&s;truction, or its Wel|fare. Some have ob&s;erved, That the <HI>Northern</HI> Parts of this I&s;land are more particularly fruitful in Bagpipes.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="199">
There are &s;o very few Per&s;ons who are Ma&s;ters in every Kind of Conver&s;ation, and can talk on all Subjects, that I don't know whether we &s;hould make a di&s;tinct Species of them: Never|thele&s;s, that my Scheme may not be defective, for the Sake of tho&s;e few who are endowed with &s;uch extraordinary Talents, I &s;hall allow them to be Harp&s;icords, a Kind of Mu&s;ick which every one knows is a Con&s;ort by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>As for your Pa&s;&s;ing-Bells, who look upon Mirth as Criminal, and talk of nothing but what is melancholy in it &s;elf, and mortifying to Hu|mane Nature, I &s;hall not mention them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall likewi&s;e pa&s;s over in Silence all the Rabble of Mankind, that crowd our Streets, Cof|fee-hou&s;es, Fea&s;ts, and publick Tables. I can|not call their Di&s;cour&s;e Conver&s;ation, but rather &s;omething that is practi&s;ed in Imitation of it. For which Rea&s;on, if I would de&s;cribe them by any Mu&s;ical In&s;trument, it &s;hould be by tho&s;e modern Inventions of the Bladder and String, Tongs and Key, Marrow-Bone and Cleaver.</P>
<P>My Reader will doubtle&s;s ob&s;erve, That I have only touched here upon Male In&s;truments, ha|ving re&s;erved my Female Con&s;ort to another Oc|ca&s;ion. If he has a Mind to know where the&s;e &s;everal Characters are to be met with, I could direct him to a whole Club of Drums; not to mention another of Bagpipes, which I have be|fore given &s;ome Account of in my De&s;cription of our Nightly Meetings in <HI>Sheer-Lane.</HI> The Lutes may often be met with in Couples upon the Banks of a Chry&s;tal Stream, or in the Retreats of &s;hady Woods and flowry Meadows; which for different Rea&s;ons are likewi&s;e the great Re|&s;ort of your Hunting-Horns. Ba&s;s-Viols are fre|quently to be found over a Gla&s;s of &s;tale Beer and a Pipe of Tobacco; whereas tho&s;e who &s;et up for Violins, &s;eldom fail to make their Appea|rance at <HI>Will</HI>'s once every Evening. You may

meet with a Trumpet any where on the other Side of <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>That we may draw &s;omething for our Advan|tage in Life out of the foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e, I mu&s;t entreat my Reader to make a narrow Search into his Life and Conver&s;ation, and upon his lea|ving any Company, to examine him&s;elf &s;eri|ou&s;ly, whether he has behaved him&s;elf in it like a Drum or a Trumpet, a Violin or a Ba&s;s-Viol; and accordingly endeavour to mend his Mu&s;ick for the future. For my own Part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was a Drum for many Years; nay, and a very noi&s;y one, till having poli&s;hed my &s;elf a little in good Company, I threw as much of the Trum|pet into my Conver&s;ation as was po&s;&s;ible for a Man of an impetuous Temper, by which Mixture of different Mu&s;icks, I look upon my &s;elf, during the Cour&s;e of many Years, to have re&s;embled a Tabor and Pipe. I have &s;ince very much endea|voured at the Sweetne&s;s of the Lute; but in Spight of all my Re&s;olutions, I mu&s;t confe&s;s with great Confu&s;ion, that I find my &s;elf daily degenerating into a Bagpipe; whether it be the Effect of my old Age, or of the Company I keep, I know not. All that I can do, is to keep a Watch over my Conver&s;ation, and to &s;ilence the Drone as &s;oon as I find it begin to hum in my Di&s;cour&s;e, being determined ra|ther to hear the Notes of others, than to play out of Time, and incroach upon their Parts in the Con&s;ort by the Noi&s;e of &s;o tire&s;ome an In|&s;trument.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Paper with a Letter which I received la&s;t Night from a Friend of mine, who knows very well my Notions upon this Subject, and invites me to pa&s;s the Even|ing at his Hou&s;e, with a &s;elect Company of Friends, in the following Words:</P>

<P>WE have already examined <HI>Homer</HI>'s De|&s;cription of a Future State, and the Con|dition in which he hath placed the Souls of the Decea&s;ed. I &s;hall in this Paper make &s;ome Ob|&s;ervations on the Account which <HI>Virgil</HI> hath gi|ven us of the &s;ame Subject, who, be&s;ides a Great|ne&s;s of Genius, had all the Lights of Philo&s;ophy and Humane Learning to a&s;&s;i&s;t and guide him in his Di&s;coveries.</P>
<P><HI>Aeneas</HI> is repre&s;ented as de&s;cending into the Empire of Death, with a Prophete&s;s by his Side, who in&s;tructs him in the Secrets of tho&s;e lower Regions.</P>
<P>Upon the Confines of the Dead, and before the very Gates of this infernal World, <HI>Virgil</HI> de&s;cribes &s;everal Inhabitants, who&s;e Natures are wonder|fully &s;uited to the Situation of the Place, as be|ing either the Occa&s;ions or Re&s;emblances of
<PB N="195" REF="202">
Death. Of the fir&s;t Kind are the Shadows of Sickne&s;s, Old Age, Fear, Famine, and Poverty; (Apparitions very terrible to behold) with &s;eve|ral others, as Toil, War, Contention, and Di&s;|cord, which contribute all of them to people this common Receptacle of humane Souls. As this was likewi&s;e a very proper Re&s;idence for every Thing that re&s;embles Death, the Poet tells us, That Sleep, whom he repre&s;ents as a near Relation to Death, has likewi&s;e his Habitation in the&s;e Quarters, and de&s;cribes in them a huge gloomy Elm-Tree, which &s;eems a very proper Ornament for the Place, and is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an innumerable Swarm of Dreams, that hang in Clu&s;ters under every Leaf of it. He then gives us a Li&s;t of imaginary Per&s;ons, who very natu|rally lie within the Shadow of the Dream-Tree, as being of the &s;ame Kind of Make in them|&s;elves, and the Materials or (to u&s;e <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>'s Phra&s;e) the Stuff of which Dreams are made. Such are the Shades of the Giant with a Hun|dred Hands, and of his Brother with Three Bo|dies; of the double-&s;hap'd <HI>Centaur,</HI> and <HI>Sylla;</HI> the <HI>Gorgon</HI> with Snakey Hair; the <HI>Harpy</HI> with a Woman's Face and Lion's Talons; the Seven|headed <HI>Hydra;</HI> and the <HI>Chimaera,</HI> which breaths forth a Flame, and is a Compound of Three Animals. The&s;e &s;everal mix'd Natures, the Creatures of Imagination, are not only introdu|ced with great Art after the Dreams, but as they are planted at the very Entrance, and with|in the very Gates of tho&s;e Regions, do probably denote the wild Deliriums and Extravagancies of Fancy, which the Soul u&s;ually falls into when &s;he is ju&s;t upon the Verge of Death.</P>
<P>Thus far <HI>Aeneas</HI> travels in an Allegory. The re&s;t of the De&s;cription is drawn with great Ex|actne&s;s, according to the Religion of the Hea|thens, and the Opinions of the <HI>Platonick</HI> Philo|&s;ophy. I &s;hall not trouble my Reader with a com|mon
<PB N="196" REF="203">
dull Story, that gives an Account why the Heathens fir&s;t of all &s;uppo&s;ed a Ferryman in Hell, and his Name to be <HI>Charon;</HI> but mu&s;t not pa&s;s over in Silence the Point of Doctrine which <HI>Vir|gil</HI> hath very much in&s;i&s;ted upon in this Book, That the Souls of tho&s;e who are unburied, are not permitted to go over into their re&s;pective Places of Re&s;t, till they have wandered a Hun|dred Years upon the Banks of <HI>Styx.</HI> This was probably an Invention of the Heathen Prie&s;t|hood, to make the People extremely careful of performing proper Rights and Ceremonies to the Memory of the Dead. I &s;hall not however, with the infamous Scribblers of the Age, take an Oc|ca&s;ion from &s;uch a Circum&s;tance, to run into Declamations again&s;t Prie&s;tcraft, but rather look upon it even in this Light as a Religious Artifice, to rai&s;e in the Minds of Men an E&s;teem for the Memory of their Forefathers, and a De&s;ire to recommend them&s;elves to that of Po&s;terity; as al&s;o to excite in them an Ambition of imitating the Virtues of the Decea&s;ed, and to keep alive in their Thoughts the Sen&s;e of the Soul's Immor|tality. In a Word, we may &s;ay in Defence of the &s;evere Opinions relating to the Shades of unburied Per&s;ons, what hath been &s;aid by &s;ome of our Divines in regard to the rigid Doctrines concerning the Souls of &s;uch who die without being initiated into our Religion, That &s;uppo&s;ing they &s;hould be erroneous, they can do no Hurt to the Dead, and will have a good Effect upon the Living, in making them cautious of neg|lecting &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary Solemnities.</P>
<P><HI>Charon</HI> is no &s;ooner appeas'd, and the Triple|headed Dog laid a&s;leep, but <HI>Aeneas</HI> makes his Entrance into the Dominions of <HI>Pluto.</HI> There are Three Kinds of Per&s;ons de&s;cribed, as being &s;ituated on the Borders; and I can give no Rea|&s;on for their being &s;tationed there in &s;o particular a Manner, but becau&s;e they none of them &s;eem
<PB N="197" REF="204">
to have had a proper Right to a Place among the Dead, as not having run out the whole Thread of their Days, and fini&s;hed the Term of Life that had been allotted them upon Earth. The Fir&s;t of the&s;e are the Souls of Infants, who are &s;natched away by untimely Ends: The Second, are of tho&s;e who are put to Death wrongfully, and by an unju&s;t Sentence; and the Third, of tho&s;e who grew weary of their Lives, and laid violent Hands upon them&s;elves. As for the Second of the&s;e, <HI>Virgil</HI> adds with great Beauty, That <HI>Mi|nos,</HI> the Judge of the Dead, is employed in giving them a Rehearing, and a&s;&s;igning them their &s;everal Quarters &s;uitable to the Parts they acted in Life. The Poet, after having mentioned the Souls of tho&s;e unhappy Men who de&s;troyed them&s;elves, breaks out into a fine Exclamation; <HI>Oh! how gladly,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>would they now endure Life with all its Mi&s;eries! But the De&s;tinies forbid their Return to Earth, and the Waters of</HI> Styx <HI>&s;ur|round them with Nine Streams that are unpa&s;&s;able.</HI> It is very remarkable, that <HI>Virgil,</HI> notwith&s;tand|ing Self-murther was &s;o frequent among the Heathens, and had been practi&s;ed by &s;ome of the greate&s;t Men in the very Age before him, hath here repre&s;ented it as &s;o heinous a Crime. But in this Particular he was guided by the Doctrines of his great Ma&s;ter <HI>Plato,</HI> who &s;ays on this Sub|ject, That a Man is placed in his Station of Life like a Soldier in his proper Po&s;t, which he is not to quit whatever may happen, until he is called off by his Commander who planted him in it.</P>
<P>There is another Point in the Platonick Philo|&s;ophy, which <HI>Virgil</HI> has made the Ground-work of the greate&s;t Part in the Piece we are now exa|mining, having with wonderful Art and Beauty materializ'd (if I may &s;o call it) a Scheme of ab|&s;tracted Notions, and cloathed the mo&s;t nice re|fined Conceptions of Philo&s;ophy in Sen&s;ible Ima|ges,
<PB N="198" REF="205">
and Poetical Repre&s;entations. The Plato|ni&s;ts tell us, That the Soul, during her Re&s;i|dence in the Body, contracts many virtuous and vicious Habits, &s;o as to become a beneficient, mild, charitable, or an angry, malicious, re|vengeful Being: A Sub&s;tance inflam'd with Lu&s;t, Avarice, and Pride; or, on the contrary, bright|en'd with pure, generous, and humble Di&s;po&s;i|tions: That the&s;e and the like Habits of Virtue and Vice growing into the very E&s;&s;ence of the Soul, &s;urvive and gather Strength in her after her Di&s;&s;olution: That the Torments of a vicious Soul in a future State ari&s;e principally from tho&s;e importunate Pa&s;&s;ions which are not capable of being gratified without a Body; and that on the contrary, the Happine&s;s of virtuous Minds very much con&s;i&s;ts in their being employed in &s;ublime Speculatins, innocent Diver&s;ions, &s;ociable Af|fections, and all the Exta&s;ies of Pa&s;&s;ion and Rap|ture which are agreeable to rea&s;onable Na|tures, and of which they gained a Reli&s;h in this Life.</P>
<P>Upon this Foundation, the Poet rai&s;es that beautiful De&s;cription of the &s;ecret Haunts and Walks, which he tells us are inhabited by de|cea&s;ed Lovers.</P>
<P>Not far from hence, &s;ays he, lies a great Wa&s;t of Plains, that are called the Fields of Melan|choly. In the&s;e there grows a Forre&s;t of Myrtle, divided into many &s;hady Retirements and cover|ed Walks, and inhabited by the Souls of tho&s;e who pined away with Love. The Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ays he, continues with them after Death. He then gives a Li&s;t of this langui&s;hing Tribe, in which his own <HI>Dido</HI> makes the principal Figure, and is de&s;crib'd as living in this &s;oft Romantick Scene, with the Shade of her fir&s;t Husband <HI>Sy|chaeus.</HI></P>
<P>The Poet in the next Place mentions another Plain that was peopled with the Gho&s;ts of War|riors
<PB N="199" REF="206">
as &s;till delighting in each other's Com|pany, and plea&s;ed with the Exerci&s;e of Arms. He there repre&s;ents the <HI>Graecian</HI> Generals and common Soldiers who peri&s;hed in the Siege of <HI>Troy</HI> as drawn up in Squadrons, and terrified at the Approach of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> which renewed in them tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions of Fear they had before re|ceived in Battle with the <HI>Trojans.</HI> He afterwards likewi&s;e, upon the &s;ame Notion, gives a View of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Heroes who lived in former Ages, amid&s;t a vi&s;ionary Scene of Chariots and Arms, flowry Meadows, &s;hining Spears, and generous Steeds, which he tells us were their Plea&s;ures upon Earth, and now make up their Happine&s;s in <HI>Ely&s;ium.</HI> For the &s;ame Rea&s;on al&s;o, he men|tions others as &s;inging Paeans, and Songs of Tri|umph, amid&s;t a beautiful Grove of Laurel. The Chief of the Con&s;ort was the Poet <HI>Mu&s;aeus,</HI> who &s;tood inclo&s;ed with a Circle of Admirers, and ro&s;e by the Head and Shoulders above the Throng of Shades that &s;urrounded him. The Habita|tions of unhappy Spirits, to &s;hew the Duration of their Torments, and the de&s;perate Condition they are in, are repre&s;ented as guarded by a Fury, moated round with a Lake of Fire, &s;treng|thened with Towers of Iron, encompa&s;&s;ed with a triple Wall, and fortified with Pillars of Ada|mant, which all the Gods together are not able to heave from their Foundations. The Noi&s;e of Stripes, the Clank of Chains, and the Groans of the Tortured, &s;trike the poius <HI>Aeneas</HI> with a kind of Horror. The Poet afterwards divides the Criminals into two Cla&s;&s;es: The fir&s;t and blacke&s;t Catalogue con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch as were guil|ty of Outrages again&s;t the Gods; and the next, of &s;uch who were convicted of Inju&s;tice between Man and Man: The greate&s;t Number of whom, &s;ays the Poet, are tho&s;e who followed the Dictates of Avarice.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="207">
It was an Opinion of the Platoni&s;ts, That the Souls of Men having contracted in the Body great Stains and Pollutions of Vice and Ignorance, there were &s;everal Purgations and Clean&s;ings ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be pa&s;&s;ed through both here and here|after, in order to refine and purify them.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil,</HI> to give this Thought likewi&s;e a Cloath|ing of Poetry, de&s;cribes &s;ome Spirits as bleaching in the Winds, others as clean&s;ing under great Falls of Waters, and others as purging in Fire to recover the primitive Beauty and Purity of their Natures.</P>
<P>It was likewi&s;e an Opinion of the &s;ame Sect of Philo&s;ophers, That the Souls of all Men exi&s;t in a &s;eparate State, long before their Union with their Bodies; and that upon their Immer&s;ion in|to Fle&s;h, they forget every Thing which pa&s;&s;ed in the State of Pre-exi&s;tence; &s;o that what we here call Knowledge, is nothing el&s;e but Memory, or the Recovery of tho&s;e Things which we knew before.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this Scheme, <HI>Virgil</HI> gives us a View of &s;everal Souls, who, to prepare them|&s;elves for living upon Earth, flock about the Banks of the River <HI>Lethe,</HI> and &s;will them&s;elves with the Waters of Oblivion.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Scheme gives him an Opportunity of making a noble Compliment to his Countrymen, where <HI>Anchi&s;es</HI> is repre&s;ented taking a Survey of the long Train of Heroes that are to de&s;cend from him, and giving his Son <HI>Aeneas</HI> an Account of all the Glories of his Race.</P>
<P>I need not mention the Revolution of the Pla|tonick Year, which is but ju&s;t touched upon in this Book; and as I have con&s;ulted no Authors Thoughts in this Explication, &s;hall be very well plea&s;ed, if it can make the noble&s;t Piece of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Poet more agreeable to my female Readers, when they think &s;it to look in|to <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Tran&s;lation of it.</P>

<P>THere lived &s;ome Years &s;ince within my Neighbourhood a very grave Per&s;on, an Uphol&s;terer, who &s;eemed a Man of more than ordinary Application to Bu&s;ine&s;s. He was a very early Ri&s;er, and was often abroad Two or Three Hours before any of his Neighbours. He had a particular Carefulne&s;s in the knitting of his Brows, and a kind of Impatience in all his Motions, that plainly di&s;covered he was always intent on Matters of Importance. Upon my Enquiry in|to his Life and Conver&s;ation, I found him to be the greate&s;t New&s;monger in our Quarter; that he ro&s;e before Day to read the <HI>Po&s;t-Man;</HI> and that he would take Two or Three Turns to the other End of the Town before his Neighbours were up, to &s;ee if there were any <HI>Dutch</HI> Mails come in. He had a Wife and &s;everal Children; but was much more inqui&s;itive to know what pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Poland</HI> than in his own Family, and was in greater Pain and Anxiety of Mind for King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s Welfare than that of his neare&s;t Rela|tions. He looked extremely thin in a Dearth of News, and never enjoyed him&s;elf in a We&s;terly Wind. This indefatigable kind of Life was the Ruin of his Shop; for about the Time that his Favourite Prince left the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> he broke and di&s;appeared.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="209">
This Man and his Affairs had been long out of my Mind, till about Three Days ago, as I was walking in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park, I heard &s;ome body at a Di&s;tance hemming after me: And who &s;hould it be but my old Neighbour the Uphol&s;terer? I &s;aw he was reduced to extreme Poverty, by certain &s;habby Superfluities in his Dre&s;s: For notwith&s;tand|ing that it was a very &s;ultry Day for the Time of the Year, he wore a loo&s;e great Coat and a Muff, with a long Campaign-Wig out of Curl; to which he had added the Ornament of a Pair of black Garters buckled under the Knee. Upon his coming up to me, I was going to enquire into his pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances; but was pre|vented by his asking me, with a Whi&s;per, Whe|ther the la&s;t Letters brought any Accounts that one might rely upon from <HI>Bender?</HI> I told him, None that I heard of; and asked him, Whether he had yet married his elde&s;t Daughter? He told me, No. But pray, &s;ays he, tell me &s;incerely, What are your Thoughts of the King of <HI>Sweden?</HI> For tho' his Wife and Children were &s;tarving, I found his chief Concern at pre&s;ent was for this great Monarch. I told him, That I looked upon him as one of the fir&s;t Heroes of the Age. But pray, &s;ays he, do you think there is any Thing in the Story of his Wound? And finding me &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the Que&s;tion, Nay, &s;ays he, I only pro|po&s;e it to you. I an&s;wered, That I thought there was no Rea&s;on to doubt of it. But why in the Heel. &s;ays he, more than in any other Part of the Body? Becau&s;e, &s;ays I, the Bullet chanced to light there.</P>
<P>This extraordinary Dialogue was no &s; one ended, but he began to launch out into a long Di&s;&s;ertation upon the Affairs of the <HI>North;</HI> and after having &s;pent &s;ome Time on them, he told me, He was in a great Perplexity how to recon|cile the <HI>Supplement</HI> with the <HI>Engli&s;h-Po&s;t,</HI> and had been ju&s;t now examining what the other Papers
<PB N="203" REF="210">
&s;ay upon the &s;ame Subject. The <HI>Daily Courant,</HI> &s;ays he, has the&s;e Words, <HI>We have Advices from very good Hands, That a certain Prince has &s;ome Matters of great Importance under Con&s;ideration.</HI> This is very my&s;terious; but the <HI>Po&s;t-Boy</HI> leaves us more in the Dark, for he tells us, <HI>That there are private Intimations of Mea&s;ures taken by a certain Prince, which Time will bring to Light.</HI> Now the <HI>Po&s;t-Man,</HI> &s;ays he, who u&s;es to be very clear, refers to the &s;ame News in the&s;e Words; <HI>The late Conduct of a certain Prince affords great Matter of Speculation.</HI> This certain Prince, &s;ays the Uphol&s;terer, whom they are all &s;o cautious of naming, I take to be&mdash;Upon which, tho' there was no Body near us, he whi&s;pered &s;omething in my Ear, which I did not hear, or think worth my while to make him repeat.</P>
<P>We were now got to the upper End of the <HI>Mall,</HI> where were Three or Four very odd Fel|lows &s;itting together upon the Bench. The&s;e I found were all of them Politicians, who u&s;ed to Sun them&s;elves in that Place every Day about Dinner-Time. Ob&s;erving them to be Curio&s;ities in their Kind, and my Friend's Acquaintance, I &s;at down among them.</P>
<P>The chief Politician of the Bench was a great A&s;&s;erter of Paradoxes. He told us, with a &s;eem|ing Concern, That by &s;ome News he had lately read from <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> it appeared to him that there was a Storm gathering in the Black Sea, which might in Time do Hurt to the Naval Forces of this Nation. To this he added, That for his Part, he could not wi&s;h to &s;ee the Turk driven out of <HI>Europe,</HI> which he believed could not but be prejudicial to our Woollen Manufacture. He then told us, That he looked upon tho&s;e extraor|dinary Revolutions which had lately happened in the&s;e Parts of the World, to have ri&s;en chiefly from Two Per&s;ons who were not much talked of; and tho&s;e, &s;ays he, are Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI> and
<PB N="204" REF="211">
the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Mirandola.</HI> He back'd his A&s;|&s;ertions with &s;o many broken Hints, and &s;uch a Show of Depth and Wi&s;dom, that we gave our &s;elves up to his Opinions.</P>
<P>The Di&s;cour&s;e at length fell upon a Point which &s;eldom e&s;capes a Knot of true-born <HI>Engli&s;h|men,</HI> Whether in Ca&s;e of a Religious War, the Prote&s;tants would not be too &s;trong for the Pa|pi&s;ts? This we unanimou&s;ly determined on the Prote&s;tant Side. One who &s;at on my Right Hand, and, as I found by his Di&s;cour&s;e, had been in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> a&s;&s;ured us, That it would be a very ea&s;ie Matter for the Prote&s;tants to beat the Pope at Sea; and added, That whenever &s;uch a War does break out, it mu&s;t turn to the Good of the <HI>Leeward</HI> I&s;lands. Upon this, one who &s;at at the End of the Bench, and, as I afterwards found, was the Geographer of the Company, &s;aid, That in ca&s;e the Papi&s;ts &s;hould drive the Prote&s;tants from the&s;e Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> when the wor&s;t came to the wor&s;t, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to beat them out of <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Greenland,</HI> provided the Nor|thern Crowns hold together, and the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;cavy</HI> &s;tand Neuter.</P>
<P>He further told us for our Comfort, That there were va&s;t Tracts of Land about the Pole, in|habited neither by Prote&s;tants nor Papi&s;ts, and of greater Extent than all the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Do|minions in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>When we had fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed this Point, my Friend the Uphol&s;terer began to exert him&s;elf upon the pre&s;ent Negotiations of Peace, in which he depo&s;ed Princes, &s;ettled the Bounds of King|doms, and ballanced the Power of <HI>Europe,</HI> with great Ju&s;tice and Impartiality.</P>
<P>I at length took my Leave of the Company, and was going away; but had not been gone Thirty Yards, before the Uphol&s;terer hemm'd again after me. Upon his advancing towards me, with a Whi&s;per, I expected to hear &s;ome &s;ecret
<PB N="205" REF="212">
Piece of News, which he had not thought fit to communicate to the Bench; but in&s;tead of that, he de&s;ired me in my Ear to lend him Half a Crown. In Compa&s;&s;ion to &s;o needy a State&s;man, and to di&s;&s;ipate the Confu&s;ion I found he was in, I told him, if he plea&s;ed, I would give him Five Shillings, to receive Five Pounds of him when the Great Turk was driven out of <HI>Con&s;t intinople;</HI> which he very readily accepted, but not before he had laid down to me the Impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch an Event, as the Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> now &s;tand.</P>
<P>This Paper I de&s;ign for the particular Benefit of tho&s;e worthy Citizens who live more in a Coffee-hou&s;e than in their Shops, and who&s;e Thoughts are &s;o taken up with the Affairs of the Allies, that they forget their Cu&s;tomers.</P>

<P>WE have already de&s;cribed out of <HI>Homer</HI> the Voyage of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to the Infernal Shades, with the &s;everal Adventures that attended it. If we look into the beautiful Romance publi&s;hed not many Years &s;ince by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cam|bray,</HI> we may &s;ee the Son of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> bound on the &s;ame Expedition, and after the &s;ame Manner making his Di&s;coveries among the Regions of the Dead. The Story of <HI>Telemachus</HI> is formed altogether in the Spirit of <HI>Homer,</HI> and will give an unlearned Reader a Notion of that great Poet's Manner of Writing, more than any Tran&s;lation of him can po&s;&s;ibly do. As it was written for
<PB N="206" REF="213">
the In&s;truction of a young Prince, who may one Day &s;it upon the Throne of <HI>France,</HI> the Author took Care to &s;uit the &s;everal Parts of his Story, and particularly the De&s;cription we are now en|tring upon, to the Character and Quality of his Pupil. For which Rea&s;on, he in&s;i&s;ts very much on the Mi&s;ery of bad, and the Happine&s;s of good Kings, in the Account he hath given of Puni&s;h|ments and Rewards in the other World.</P>
<P>We may however ob&s;erve, notwith&s;tanding the Endeavours of this great and learned Author, to copy after the Style and Sentiments of <HI>Homer,</HI> that there is a certain Tincture of Chri&s;tianity running through the whole Relation. The Prelate in &s;everal Places mixes him&s;elf with the Poet; &s;o that his future State puts me in Mind of <HI>Michael Angelo</HI>'s La&s;t Judgment, where <HI>Charon</HI> and his Boat are repre&s;ented as bearing a Part in the dreadful Solemnities of that great Day.</P>
<P><HI>Telemachus,</HI> after having pa&s;&s;ed through the dark Avenues of Death in the Retinue of <HI>Mer|cury,</HI> who every Day delivers up a certain Tale of Gho&s;ts to the Ferryman of <HI>Styx,</HI> is admitted into the Infernal Bark. Among the Companions of his Voyage, is the Shade of <HI>Nabopharzon,</HI> a King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and Tyrant of all the <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> Among the Ceremonies and Pomps of his Funeral, there were Four Slaves &s;acrificed, according to the Cu|&s;tom of the Country, in order to attend him a|mong the Shades. The Author having de&s;cribed this Tyrant in the mo&s;t odious Colours of Pride, In&s;olence, and Cruelty, tells us, That his Four Slaves, in&s;tead of &s;erving him after Death, were perpetually in&s;ulting him with Reproaches and Affronts for his pa&s;t U&s;age; That they &s;purn'd him as he lay upon the Ground, and forc'd him to &s;how his Face, which he would fain have co|vered, as lying under all the Confu&s;ions of Guilt and Infamy; and in &s;hort, that they kept him
<PB N="207" REF="214">
bound in a Chain, in order to drag him before the Tribunal of the Dead.</P>
<P><HI>Telemachus,</HI> upon looking out of the Bark, &s;ees all the Strand covered with an innumerable Mul|titude of Shades, who, upon his jumping a&s;hore, immediately vani&s;hed. He then pur&s;ues his Cour&s;e to the Palace of <HI>Pluto,</HI> who is de&s;cribed as &s;eated on his Throne in terrible Maje&s;ty, with <HI>Pro&s;erpine</HI> by his Side. At the Foot of his Throne was the pale hideous Spectre, who, by the Gha&s;tline&s;s of his Vi&s;age, and the Nature of the Apparitions that &s;urrounded him, di&s;covers him|&s;elf to be Death. His Attendants are, Melan|choly, Di&s;tru&s;t, Revenge, Hatred, Avarice, De|&s;pair, Ambition, Envy, Impiety, with frightful Dreams, and waking Cares, which are all drawn very naturally in proper Actions and Po&s;tures. The Author, with great Beauty, places near his frightful Dreams an A&s;&s;embly of Phantoms, which are often employed to terrify the Living, by appearing in the Shape and Likene&s;s of the Dead.</P>
<P>The young Hero in the next Place takes a Survey of the different Kinds of Criminals that lay in Torture among Clouds of Sulphur, and Torrents of Fire. The Fir&s;t of the&s;e were &s;uch as had been guilty of Impieties, which every one hath an Horror for: To which is added, a Catalogue of &s;uch Offenders that &s;carce appear to be faulty in the Eyes of the Vulgar. Among the&s;e, &s;ays the Author, are malicious Criticks, that have endeavoured to ca&s;t a Blemi&s;h upon the Perfections of others; with whom he likewi&s;e places &s;uch as have often hurt the Reputation of the Innocent, by pa&s;&s;ing a ra&s;h Judgment on their Actions, without knowing the Occa&s;ion of them. The&s;e Crimes, &s;ays he, are more &s;e|verely puni&s;hed after Death, becau&s;e they gene|rally meet with Impunity upon Earth.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="215">
<HI>Telemachus,</HI> after having taken a Survey of &s;e|veral other Wretches in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, arrives at that Region of Torments in which wicked Kings are puni&s;hed. The e are very fine Strokes of Imagination in the De&s;cription which he gives of this unhappy Multitude. He tells us, That on one Side of them there &s;tood a re|venge&s;ul Fury, thundering in their Ears ince&s;&s;ant Repetitions of all the Crimes they had commit|ted upon Earth, with the Aggravations of Am|bition, Vanity, Hardne&s;s of Heart, and all tho&s;e &s;ecret Affections of Mind that enter into the Compo&s;ition of a Tyrant. At the &s;ame Time, &s;he holds up to them a large Mirror, in which every one &s;ees him&s;elf repre&s;ented in the natural Horror and Deformity of his Character. On the other Side of them &s;tands another Fury, that with an in&s;ulting Deri&s;ion, repeats to them all the Prai&s;es that their Flatterers had be&s;towed upon them while they &s;at upon their re&s;pective Thrones. She too, &s;ays the Author, pre&s;ents a Mirror before their Eyes, in which every one &s;ees him&s;elf adorn'd with all tho&s;e Beauties and Perfections in which they had been drawn by the Vanity of their own Hearts, and the Flattery of others. To puni&s;h them for the Wantonne&s;s of the Cruelty which they formerly exerci&s;ed, they are now delivered up to be treated according to the Fancy and Caprice of &s;everal Slaves, who have here an Opportunity of tyrannizing in their Turns.</P>
<P>The Author having given us a De&s;cription of the&s;e gha&s;tly Spectres, who, &s;ays he, are always calling upon Death, and are placed under the Di&s;tillation of that burning Vengeance which falls upon them Drop by Drop, and is never to be exhau&s;ted, leads us into a plea&s;ing Scene of Groves, filled with the Melody of Birds, and the Odours of a Thou&s;and different Plants. The&s;e Groves are repre&s;ented as ri&s;ing among a great
<PB N="209" REF="216">
many flowry Meadows, and watered with Streams that diffu&s;e a perpetual Fre&s;hne&s;s, in the mid&s;t of an eternal Day, and a never-fading Spring. This, &s;ays the Author, was the Habitation of tho&s;e good Princes who were Friends of the Gods, and Parents of the People. Among the&s;e, <HI>Telemachus</HI> conver&s;es with the Shade of one of his Ance&s;tors, who makes a mo&s;t agreeable Re|lation of the Joys of <HI>Ely&s;ium,</HI> and the Nature of its Inhabitants. The Re&s;idence of <HI>Se&s;o&s;tris</HI> a|mong the&s;e happy Shades, with his Character and pre&s;ent Employment, is drawn in a very lively Manner, and with a great Elevation of Thought.</P>
<P>The De&s;cription of that pure and gentle Light which overflows the&s;e happy Regions, and cloaths the Spirits of the&s;e virtuous Per&s;ons, hath &s;omething in it of that Enthu&s;ia&s;m which this Author was accu&s;ed of by his Enemies in the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> but however it may look in Religion, it makes a very beautiful Figure in Poetry.</P>
<P>The Rays of the Sun, &s;ays he, are Darkne&s;s in Compari&s;on with this Light, which rather de|&s;erves the Name of Glory, than that of Light. It pierces the thicke&s;t Bodies, in the &s;ame Man|ner as the Sun Beams pa&s;s through Chry&s;tal: It &s;trengthens the Sight in&s;tead of dazzling it; and nouri&s;hes in the mo&s;t inward Rece&s;&s;es of the Mind, a perpetual Serenity that is not to be ex|pre&s;s'd. It enters and incorporates it &s;elf with the very Sub&s;tance of the Soul: The Spirits of the Ble&s;&s;ed feel it in all their Sen&s;es, and in all their Perceptions. It produces a certain Source of Peace and Joy that ari&s;es in them for ever, running through all the Faculties, and refre&s;h|ing all the De&s;ires of the Soul. External Plea|&s;ures and Delights, with all their Charms and Allurements, are regarded with the utmo&s;t In|difference
<PB N="210" REF="217">
and Neglect by the&s;e happy Spirits who have this great Principle of Plea&s;ure with|in them, drawing the whole Mind to its &s;elf, calling off their Attention from the mo&s;t de|lightful Objects, and giving them all the Tran|&s;ports of Inebriation, without the Confu&s;ion and the Folly of it.</P>
<P>I have here only mentioned &s;ome Ma&s;ter-Touches of this admirable Piece, becau&s;e the Original it &s;elf is under&s;tood by the greater Part of my Readers. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I take a parti|cular Delight in the&s;e Pro&s;pects of Futurity, whether grounded upon the probable Sugge&s;tions of a fine Imagination, or the more &s;evere Con|clu&s;ions of Philo&s;ophy; as a Man loves to hear all the Di&s;coveries or Conjectures relating to a Foreign Country which he is, at &s;ome Time, to inhabit. Pro&s;pects of this Nature lighten the Burden of any pre&s;ent Evil, and refre&s;h us under the wor&s;t and lowe&s;t Circum&s;tances of Mortality. They extingui&s;h in us both the Fear and Envy of Humane Grandeur. In&s;olence &s;hrinks its Head, Power di&s;appears; Pain, Po|verty, and Death, fly before them. In &s;hort, the Mind that is habituated to the lively Sen&s;e of an Hereafter, can hope for what is the mo&s;t terrifying to the Generality of Mankind, and re|joice in what is the mo&s;t afflicting.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>April 10.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Was la&s;t Night in an A&s;&s;embly of very Fine Women. How I came among them, is of no great Importance to the Reader. I &s;hall only let him know, that I was betrayed into &s;o good Com|pany by the Device of an old Friend, who had promi&s;ed to give &s;ome of his Female Acquain|tance a Sight of Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff.</HI> Upon hearing my Name mentioned, a Lady who &s;at by me told me, they had brought together a Female Con&s;ort for my Entertainment. You mu&s;t know, &s;ays &s;he, that we all of us look upon our &s;elves to be Mu|&s;ical In&s;truments, though we do not yet know of what Kind, which we hope to learn from you, if you will give us Leave to play before you. This was followed by a general Laugh, which I always look upon as a nece&s;&s;ary Flouri&s;h in the Opening of a Female Con&s;ort. They then &s;truck up toge|ther, and play'd a whole Hour upon Two Grounds, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Trial,</HI> and the <HI>Opera.</HI> I could not but ob&s;erve, that &s;everal of their Notes were more &s;oft, and &s;everal more &s;harp, than any that ever I heard in a Male Con&s;ort; though I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, there was not any Regard to Time, nor any of tho&s;e Re&s;ts and Pau&s;es which are frequent in the Harmony of the other Sex. Be&s;ides, that the Mu&s;ick was generally full, and no particular In|&s;trument permitted to play long by its &s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;eemed &s;o very well plea&s;ed with what every one &s;aid, and &s;miled with &s;o much Complai&s;ance
<PB N="212" REF="219">
at all their pretty Fancies, that though I did not put one Word into their Di&s;cour&s;e, I have the Vanity to think, they looked upon me as very agreeable Company. I then told 'em, That if I were to draw the Picture of &s;o many charming Mu&s;icians, it &s;hould be like one I had &s;een of the Mu&s;es, with their &s;everal In&s;truments in their Hands. Upon which the Lady Kettle-Drum to&s;|&s;ed back her Head, and cry'd, A very pretty Si|mile! The Con&s;ort again revived; in which, with Nods, Smiles, and Approbations, I bore the Part rather of one who beats the Time, than of a Per|former.</P>
<P>I was no &s;ooner retired to my Lodgings, but I ran over in my Thoughts the &s;everal Characters of this Fair A&s;&s;embly, which I &s;hall give &s;ome Account of, becau&s;e they are various in their Kind, and may each of them &s;tand as a Sample of a whole Species.</P>
<P>The Per&s;on who plea&s;ed me mo&s;t was a Flute, an In&s;trument that, without any great Compa&s;s, hath &s;omething exqui&s;itely &s;weet and &s;oft in its Sound: It lulls and &s;ooths the Ear, and fills it with &s;uch a gentle Kind of Melody, as keeps the Mind awake without &s;tartling it, and rai&s;es a mo&s;t agreeable Pa&s;&s;ion between Tran&s;port and Indo|lence. In &s;hort, the Mu&s;ick of the Flute is the Conver&s;ation of a mild and amiable Woman, that has nothing in it very elevated, or at the &s;ame Time any Thing mean or trivial.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that the Hautboy is the mo&s;t perfect of the Flute-Species, which, with all the Sweetne&s;s of the Sound, hath a great Strength and Variety of Notes; though at the &s;ame Time I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the Hautboy in one Sex is as &s;carce as the Harp&s;icord in the other.</P>
<P>By the Side of the Flute there &s;at a Flageolet, for &s;o I mu&s;t call a certain young Lady, who fancying her &s;elf a Wit, de&s;pi&s;ed the Mu&s;ick of the Flute as low and in&s;ipid, and would be enter|taining
<PB N="213" REF="220">
the Company with tart ill-natured Ob&s;er|vations, pert Fancies, and little Turns, which &s;he imagined to be full of Life and Spirit. The Fla|geolet therefore doth not differ from the Flute &s;o much in the Compa&s;s of its Notes, as in the Shril|ne&s;s and Sharpne&s;s of the Sound. We mu&s;t how|ever take Notice, that the Flageolets among their own Sex are more valued and e&s;teemed than the Flutes.</P>
<P>There chanced to be a Coquet in the Con&s;ort, that with a great many skitti&s;h Notes, affected Squeaks, and &s;tudied Incon&s;i&s;tencies, di&s;tingui&s;h'd her &s;elf from the re&s;t of the Company. She did not &s;peak a Word during the whole <HI>Trial;</HI> but I thought &s;he would never have done upon the <HI>Opera.</HI> One while &s;he would break out upon, <HI>That hideous King!</HI> Then upon the charming Black-moor! Then, <HI>Oh that dear Lion!</HI> Then would hum over Two or Three Notes; then run to the Window to &s;ee what Coach was coming. The Coquet therefore I mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h by that Mu&s;ical In&s;trument which is commonly known by the Name of a Kit, that is more jiggi&s;h than the Fiddle it &s;elf, and never &s;ounds but to a Dance.</P>
<P>The Fourth Per&s;on who bore a Part in the Con|ver&s;ation was a Prude, who &s;tuck to the Trial, and was &s;ilent upon the whole Opera. The Gravi|ty of her Cen&s;ures, and Compo&s;ure of her Voice, which were often attended with &s;upercilious Ca&s;ts of the Eye, and a &s;eeming Contempt for the Lightne&s;s of the Conver&s;ation, put me in Mind of that ancient &s;erious Matron-like In&s;trument the Virginal.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over in Silence a <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> Hornpipe, by which I would &s;ignify a young Country Lady, who with a great deal of Mirth and Innocence diverted the Company very agree|ably; and, if I am not mi&s;taken, by that Time the Wildne&s;s of her Notes is a little &s;oftened,
<PB N="214" REF="221">
and the Redundancy of her Mu&s;ick re&s;trained by Conver&s;ation and good Company, will be im|proved into one of the mo&s;t amiable Flutes about the Town. Your Romps and Boarding-School Girls fall likewi&s;e under this Denomination.</P>
<P>On the Right-Hand of the Hornpipe &s;at a <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Harp, an In&s;trument which very much delights in the Tunes of old Hi&s;torical Ballads, and in ce|lebrating the Renown'd Actions and Exploits of ancient <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Heroes. By this In&s;trument I therefore would de&s;cribe a certain Lady, who is one of tho&s;e Female Hi&s;torians that upon all Oc|ca&s;ions enters into Pedigrees and De&s;cents, and finds her &s;elf related, by &s;ome Off-&s;hoot or other, to almo&s;t every great Family in <HI>England:</HI> For which Rea&s;on &s;he jarrs and is out of Tune very often in Conver&s;ation, for the Company's Want of due Attention and Re&s;pect to her.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t &s;onorous Part of our Con&s;ort was a She-Drum, or (as the Vulgar call it) a Kettle-Drum, who accompanied her Di&s;cour&s;e with Motions of the Body, To&s;&s;es of the Head, and Brandi&s;hes of the Fan. Her Mu&s;ick was loud, bold, and ma&s;culine. Every Thump &s;he gave, alarmed the Company, and very often &s;et &s;ome Body or other in it a Blu&s;hing.</P>
<P>The la&s;t I &s;hall mention was a certain Roman|tick In&s;trument called a <HI>Dulcimer,</HI> who talked of nothing but &s;hady Woods, flowry Meadows, purling Streams, Larks and Nightingals, with all the Beauties of the Spring, and the Plea&s;ures of a Country Life. This In&s;trument hath a fine melancholy Sweetne&s;s in it, and goes very well with the Flute.</P>
<P>I think mo&s;t of the conver&s;able Part of Wo|mankind may be found under one of the forego|ing Divi&s;ions; but it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the Generality of that Sex, notwith&s;tanding they have naturally a great Genius for being talkative, are not Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of more than one Note; with which
<PB N="215" REF="222">
however, by frequent Repetition, they make a greater Sound than tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the whole Gammut, as may be ob&s;erved in your La|rums or Hou&s;hold Scolds, and in your Ca&s;tanets or impertinent Tittle-Tattles, who have no other Variety in their Di&s;cour&s;e but that of talking &s;lower or fa&s;ter.</P>
<P>Upon communicating this Scheme of Mu&s;ick to an old Friend of mine, who was formerly a Man of Gallantry and a Rover, he told me, That he believed he had been in Love with every In|&s;trument in my Con&s;ort. The fir&s;t that &s;mit him was a Hornpipe, who lived near his Father's Hou&s;e in the Country; but upon his failing to meet her at an A&s;&s;ize, according to Appointment, &s;he ca&s;t him off. His next Pa&s;&s;ion was for a Ket|tle-Drum, whom he fell in Love with at a Play; but when he became acquainted with her, not finding the Softne&s;s of her Sex in her Conver&s;a|tion, he grew cool to her; though at the &s;ame Time he could not deny, but that &s;he behaved her &s;elf very much like a Gentlewoman. His Third Mi&s;tre&s;s was a Dulcimer, who he found took great Delight in &s;ighing and langui&s;hing, but would go no further than the Preface of Matri|mony; &s;o that &s;he would never let a Lover have any more of her than her Heart, which, after ha|ving won, he was forced to leave her, as de&s;pair|ing of any further Succe&s;s. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;ays my Friend, I have often con&s;idered her with a great deal of Admiration; and I find her Plea|&s;ure is &s;o much in this fir&s;t Step of an Amour, that her Life will pa&s;s away in Dream, Solitude, and Soliloquy, till her Decay of Charms makes her &s;natch at the wor&s;t Man that ever pretended to her. In the next Place, &s;ays my Friend, I fell in Love with a Kit, who led me &s;uch a Dance through all the Varieties of a familiar, cold, fond, and indifferent Behaviour, that the World began to grow cen&s;orious, though without any Cau&s;e.

<P><HI>TOm Folio</HI> is a Broker in Learning, employed to get together good Editions, and &s;tock the Libraries of great Men. There is not a Sale of Books begins till <HI>Tom Folio</HI> is &s;een at the Door. There is not an Auction where his Name is not heard, and that too in the very Nick of Time, in the Critical Moment, before the la&s;t deci&s;ive Stroke of the Hammer. There is not a Sub&s;crip|tion goes forward, in which <HI>Tom</HI> is not privy to the fir&s;t rough Draught of the Propo&s;als; nor a Catalogue printed, that doth not come to him wet from the Pre&s;s. He is an univer&s;al Scholar, &s;o far as the Title-Page of all Authors, knows the Manu&s;cripts in which they were di&s;covered, the Editions through which they have pa&s;&s;ed, with the Prai&s;es or Cen&s;ures which they have received from the &s;everal Members of the Learned World. He has a greater E&s;teem for <HI>Aldus</HI> and <HI>Elzevir,</HI> than for <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Horace.</HI> If you talk of <HI>Hero|dotus,</HI> he breaks out into a Panegyrick upon <HI>Harry Stephans.</HI> He thinks he gives you an Ac|count of an Author, when he tells you the Sub|ject he treats of, the Name of the Editor, and the Year in which it was printed. Or if you draw him into further Particulars, he cries up the Good|ne&s;s of the Paper, extols the Diligence of the Corrector, and is tran&s;ported with the Beauty of the Letter. This he looks upon to be &s;ound Learning and &s;ub&s;tantial Critici&s;m. As for tho&s;e
<PB N="218" REF="225">
who talk of the Finene&s;s of Style, and the Ju&s;t|ne&s;s of Thought, or de&s;cribe the Brightne&s;s of any particular Pa&s;&s;ages; nay, though they write them&s;elves in the Genius and Spirit of the Author they admire, <HI>Tom</HI> looks upon them as Men of &s;u|perficial Learning, and fla&s;hy Parts.</P>
<P>I had Ye&s;terday Morning a Vi&s;it from this learned Idiot, (for that is the Light in which I con&s;ider every Pedant) when I di&s;covered in him &s;ome little Touches of the Coxcomb, which I had not before ob&s;erv'd. Being very full of the Fi|gure which he makes in the Republick of Letters, and wonderfully &s;atisfied with his great Stock of Knowledge, he gave me broad Intimations, that he did not <HI>believe</HI> in all Points as his Forefathers had done. He then communicated to me a Thought of a certain Author upon a Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Account of the Dead, which I made the Subject of a late Paper. This Thought hath ta|ken very much among Men of <HI>Tom</HI>'s Pitch and Under&s;tanding, though univer&s;ally exploded by all that know how to con&s;true <HI>Virgil,</HI> or have any Reli&s;h of Antiquity. Not to trouble my Reader with it, I found upon the whole, that <HI>Tom</HI> did not believe a future State of Rewards and Puni&s;h|ments, becau&s;e <HI>Aeneas,</HI> at his leaving the Empire of the Dead, pa&s;&s;ed through the Gate of Ivory, and not through that of Horn. Knowing that <HI>Tom</HI> had not Sen&s;e enough to give up an Opinion which he had once received, that he might avoid wrangling, I told him, That <HI>Virgil</HI> po&s;&s;ibly had his Over&s;ights as well as another Author.

in the Third <HI>Georgick,</HI> where you may find a Semicolon turned up&s;ide down. Perhaps, &s;aid I, the&s;e were not <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Thoughts, but tho&s;e of the Tran&s;criber. I do not de&s;ign it, &s;ays <HI>Tom,</HI> as a Reflection on <HI>Virgil:</HI> On the contrary, I know that all the Manu&s;cripts <HI>reclaim</HI> again&s;t &s;uch a Punctuation. Oh! Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> &s;ays he, what would a Man give to &s;ee one Simile of <HI>Virgil</HI> writ in his own Hand? I asked him which was the Simile he meant; but was an&s;wered, Any Simile in <HI>Virgil.</HI> He then told me all the &s;ecret Hi&s;tory in the Commonwealth of Learning; of Modern Pieces that had the Names of ancient Authors an|nex'd to them; of all the Books that were now writing or printing in the &s;everal Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> of many Amendments which are made, and not yet publi&s;hed; and a Thou&s;and other Particulars, which I would not have my Memory burthen'd with for a Vatican.</P>
<P>At length, being fully per&s;uaded that I tho|roughly admired him, and looked upon him as a Prodigy of Learning, he took his Leave. I know &s;everal of <HI>Tom</HI>'s Cla&s;s who are profe&s;&s;ed Admirers of <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> without under&s;tanding a Word of <HI>Italian;</HI> and one in particular, that carries a <HI>Pa&s;tor-Fido</HI> in his Pocket, in which I am &s;ure he is acquaint|ed with no other Beauty but the Clearne&s;s of the Character.</P>
<P>There is another Kind of Pedant, who, with all <HI>Tom Folio</HI>'s Impertinencies, hath greater Super|&s;tructures and Embelli&s;hments of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> and is &s;till more in&s;upportable than the other, in the &s;ame Degree as he is more learned. Of this Kind very often are Editors, Commentators, In|terpreters, Scholia&s;ts, and Criticks; and in &s;hort, all Men of deep Learning without common Sen&s;e. The&s;e Per&s;ons &s;et a greater Value on them&s;elves for having found out the Meaning of a Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Greek,</HI> than upon the Author for having written it; nay, will allow the Pa&s;&s;age it &s;elf not to have
<PB N="220" REF="227">
any Beauty in it, at the &s;ame Time that they would be con&s;idered as the greate&s;t Men of the Age for having interpreted it. They will look with Con|tempt upon the mo&s;t beautiful Poems that have been compo&s;ed by any of their Contemporaries; but will lock them&s;elves up in their Studies for a Twelvemonth together, to correct, publi&s;h, and expound, &s;uch Trifles of Antiquity as a modern Author would be contemn'd for. Men of the &s;tricte&s;t Morals, &s;evere&s;t Lives, and the grave&s;t Profe&s;&s;ions, will write Volumes upon an idle Son|net that is originally in <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latin;</HI> give Edi|tions of the mo&s;t immoral Authors, and &s;pin out whole Pages upon the various Readings of a lewd Expre&s;&s;ion. All that can be &s;aid in Excu&s;e for them, is, That their Works &s;ufficiently &s;how they have no Ta&s;t of their Authors; and that what they do in this Kind, is out of their great Learn|ing, and not out of any Levity or La&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s of Temper.</P>

<P>THE Wits of this I&s;land, for above Fifty Years pa&s;t, in&s;tead of correcting the Vices of the Age, have done all they could to inflame them. Marriage has been one of the common Topicks of Ridicule that every Stage-Scribbler hath found his Account in; for whenever there is an Occa&s;ion for a Clap, an impertinent Je&s;t upon Matrimony is &s;ure to rai&s;e it. This hath been attended with very pernicious Con&s;equences. Many a Country 'Squire, upon his &s;etting up for a Man of the Town, has gone Home in the Gaiety of his Heart and beat his Wife. A kind Husband hath been looked upon as a Clown, and a good Wife as a Dome&s;tick Animal, unfit for the Company or Conver&s;ation of the <HI>Beau Monde.</HI> In &s;hort, Sepa|rate Beds, Silent Tables, and Solitary Homes, have been introduced by your Men of Wit and Plea&s;ure of the Age.</P>
<P>As I &s;hall always make it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;tem the Torrents of Prejudice and Vice, I &s;hall take particular Care to put an hone&s;t Father of a Fa|mily in Countenance, and endeavour to remove all the Evils out of that State of Life, which is either the mo&s;t happy, or mo&s;t mi&s;erable, that a Man can be placed in. In order to this, let us, if you plea&s;e, con&s;ider the Wits and well-bred Per|&s;ons of former Times. I have &s;hown in another Paper, That <HI>Pliny,</HI> who was a Man of the great|e&s;t
<PB N="222" REF="229">
Genius, as well as of the Fir&s;t Quality of his Age, did not think it below nim to be a kind Husband, and to treat his Wife as a Friend, Com|panion and Coun&s;ellor. I &s;hall give the like In|&s;tance of another, who in all Re&s;pects was a much greater Man than <HI>Pliny,</HI> and hath written a whole Book of Letters to his Wife. They are not &s;o full of Turns as tho&s;e tran&s;lated out of the former Author, who writes very much like a Modern, but are full of that beautiful Simplicity which is altogether natural, and is the di&s;tingui&s;hing Cha|racter of the be&s;t ancient Writers. The Author I am &s;peaking of, is <HI>Cicero;</HI> who, in the follow|ing Pa&s;&s;ages which I have taken out of his Let|ters, &s;hows, that he did not think it incon&s;i&s;tent with the Politene&s;s of his Manners, or the Great|ne&s;s of his Wi&s;dom, to &s;tand upon Record in his Dome&s;tick Character.</P>
<P>The&s;e Letters were written at a Time when he was bani&s;h'd from his Country, by a Faction that then prevail'd at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<P>A Common Civility to an impertinent Fellow often draws upon one a great many unfore|&s;een Troubles; and if one doth not take particu|lar Care, will be interpreted by him as an Over|ture of Friend&s;hip and Intimacy. This I was very &s;en&s;ible of this Morning. About Two Hours be|fore
<PB N="228" REF="235">
Day, I heard a great Rapping at my Door, which continued &s;ome Time, till my Maid could get her &s;elf ready to go down and &s;ee what was the Occa&s;ion of it. She then brought me up Word, That there was a Gentleman who &s;eemed very much in Ha&s;te, and &s;aid he mu&s;t needs &s;peak with me. By the De&s;cription &s;he gave me of him, and by his Voice, which I could hear as I lay in my Bed, I fancied him to be my old Acquaintance the Uphol&s;terer, whom I met the other Day in St. <HI>James</HI>'s-<HI>Park.</HI> For which Rea&s;on, I bid her tell the Gentleman, whoever he was, That I was indi&s;po&s;ed, that I could &s;ee no Body, and that, if he had any Thing to &s;ay to me, I de&s;ired he would leave it in Writing. My Maid, after having delivered her Me&s;&s;age, told me, That the Gentle|man &s;aid he would &s;tay at the next Coffee-hou&s;e till I was &s;tirring, and bid her be &s;ure to tell me, That the <HI>French</HI> were driven from the <HI>Scarp,</HI> and that <HI>Douay</HI> was inve&s;ted. He gave her the Name of another Town, which I found &s;he had drop|ped by the Way.</P>
<P>As much as I love to be informed of the Suc|ce&s;s of my brave Countrymen, I do not care for hearing of a Victory before Day, and was there|fore very much out of Humour at this un&s;ea&s;ona|ble Vi&s;it. I had no &s;ooner recovered my Temper, and was falling a&s;leep, but I was immediately &s;tartled by a Second Rap; and upon my Maid's opening the Door, heard the &s;ame Voice ask her, If her Ma&s;ter was yet up? and at the &s;ame Time bid her tell me, That he was come on Purpo&s;e to talk with me about a Piece of Home-News that every Body in Town will be full of Two Hours hence. I ordered my Maid as &s;oon as &s;he came into the Room, without hearing her Me&s;&s;age, to tell the Gentleman, That whatever his News is, I would rather hear it Two Hours hence than now; and that I per&s;i&s;ted in my Re&s;olution not to &s;peak with any Body that Morning. The
<PB N="229" REF="236">
Wench delivered my An&s;wer pre&s;ently, and &s;hut the Door. It was impo&s;&s;ible for me to compo&s;e my &s;elf to Sleep after Two &s;uch unexpected Alarms; for which Rea&s;on I put on my Clothes in a very peevi&s;h Humour. I took &s;everal Turns about my Chamber, reflecting with a great deal of Anger and Contempt on the&s;e Volunteers in Politicks, that undergo all the Pain, Watchful|ne&s;s, and Di&s;quiet of a Fir&s;t Mini&s;ter, without turning it to the Advantage either of them&s;elves or their Country; and yet it is &s;urpri&s;ing to con|&s;ider how numerous this Species of Men is. There is nothing more frequent than to find a Taylor breaking his Re&s;t on the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> and to &s;ee a Clu&s;ter of Porters &s;itting upon the Mini&s;try. Our Streets &s;warm with Politicians, and there is &s;carce a Shop which is not held by a State&s;man. As I was mu&s;ing after this Manner, I heard the Uphol&s;terer at the Door delivering a Letter to my Maid, and begging her, in a very great Hurry, to give it to her Ma&s;ter as &s;oon as ever he was awake, which I opened, and found as follows:</P>

<P>I Was walking Two or Three Days ago in a very plea&s;ing Retirement, and amu&s;ing my &s;elf with the Reading of that ancient and beauti|ful
<PB N="233" REF="240">
Allegory, called, <HI>The Table of Cebes.</HI> I was at la&s;t &s;o tired with my Walk, that I &s;at down to re&s;t my &s;elf upon a Bench that &s;tood in the Mid&s;t of an agreeable Shade. The Mu&s;ick of the Birds, that filled all the Trees about me, lull'd me a&s;leep before I was aware of it; which was fol|lowed by a Dream, that I impute in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure to the foregoing Author, who had made an Impre&s;&s;ion upon my Imagination, and put me into his own Way of Thinking.</P>
<P>I fancied my &s;elf among the <HI>Alpes,</HI> and, as it is natural in a Dream, &s;eemed every Moment to bound from one Summit to another, till at la&s;t, after having made this Airy Progre&s;s over the Tops of &s;everal Mountains, I arrived at the very Centre of tho&s;e broken Rocks and Precipices. I here, methought, faw a prodigious Circuit of Hills, that reached above the Clouds, and encom|pa&s;&s;ed a large Space of Ground, which I had a great Curio&s;ity to look into. I thereupon conti|nued my former Way of travelling through a great Variety of Winter Scenes, till I had gained the Top of the&s;e white Mountains, which &s;eem|ed another <HI>Alpes</HI> of Snow. I looked down from hence into a &s;pacious Plain, which was &s;urround|ed on all Sides by this Mound of Hills, and which pre&s;ented me with the mo&s;t agreeable Pro&s;pect I had ever &s;een. There was a greater Variety of Colours in the Embroidery of the Meadows, a more lively Green in the Leaves and Gra&s;s, a brighter Chry&s;tal in the Streams, than what I ever met with in any other Region. The Light it &s;elf had &s;omething more &s;hining and glorious in it than that of which the Day is made in other Places. I was wonderfully a&s;toni&s;hed at the Di&s;|covery of &s;uch a Paradi&s;e amid&s;t the Wildne&s;s of tho&s;e cold, hoary Landskips which lay about it; but found at length, that this happy Region was inhabited by the Godde&s;s of <HI>Liberty;</HI> who&s;e Pre|&s;ence &s;oftened the Rigours of the Climate, en|riched
<PB N="234" REF="241">
the Barrenne&s;s of the Soil, and more than &s;upplied the Ab&s;ence of the Sun. The Place was covered with a wonderful Profu&s;ion of Flowers, that without being di&s;po&s;ed into regular Borders and Parterres, grew promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and had a greater Beauty in their natural Luxuriancy and Di&s;order, than they could have received from the Checks and Re&s;traints of Art. There was a Ri|ver that aro&s;e out of the South Side of the Moun|tain, that by an infinite Number of Turns and Windings, &s;eemed to vi&s;it every Plant, and che|ri&s;h the &s;everal Beauties of the Spring, with which the Fields abounded. After having run to and fro in a wonderful Variety of Meanders, as unwilling to leave &s;o charming a Place, it at la&s;t throws it &s;elf into the Hollow of a Moun|tain, from whence it pa&s;&s;es under a long Range of Rocks, and at length ri&s;es in that Part of the <HI>Alpes</HI> where the Inhabitants think it the Fir&s;t Source of the <HI>Rhone.</HI> This River, after having made its Progre&s;s through tho&s;e free Nations, &s;tagnates in a huge Lake at the leaving of them, and no &s;ooner enters into the Regions of Slavery, but runs through them with an incredible Rapi|dity, and takes its &s;horte&s;t Way to the Sea.</P>
<P>I de&s;cended into the happy Fields that lay be|neath me, and in the mid&s;t of them, beheld the Godde&s;s fitting upon a Throne. She had no|thing to enclo&s;e her but the Bounds of her own Dominions, and nothing over her Head but the Heavens. Every Glance of her Eye ca&s;t a Track of Light where it fell, that revived the Spring, and made all Things &s;mile about her. My Heart grew chearful at the Sight of her, and as &s;he look|ed upon me, I found a certain Confidence grow|ing in me, and &s;uch an inward Re&s;olution as I never felt before that Time.</P>
<P>On the Left Hand of the Godde&s;s &s;at the Ge|nius of a Commonwealth, with the Cap of Li|berty on her Head, and in her Hand a Wand
<PB N="235" REF="242">
like that with which a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizen u&s;ed to give his Slaves their Freedom. There was &s;omething mean and vulgar, but at the &s;ame Time exceed|ing bold and daring, in her Air; her Eyes were full of Fire, but had in them &s;uch Ca&s;ts of Fierce|ne&s;s and Cruelty, as made her appear to me ra|ther dreadful than amiable. On her Shoulders &s;he wore a Mantle, on which there was wrought a great Confu&s;ion of Figures. As it flew in the Wind, I could not di&s;cern the particular De&s;ign of them, but &s;aw Wounds in the Bodies of &s;ome, and Agonies in the Faces of others; and over one Part of it could read in Letters of Blood, <HI>The Ides of March.</HI></P>
<P>On the Right Hand of the Godde&s;s was the Genius of Monarchy. She was cloathed in the white&s;t Ermin, and wore a Crown of the pure&s;t Gold upon her Head. In her Hand &s;he held a Scepter like that which is born by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Monarchs. A Couple of tame Lions lay crouch|ing at her Feet: Her Countenance had in it a very great Maje&s;ty without any Mixture of Ter|ror: Her Voice was like the Voice of an Angel, filled with &s;o much Sweetne&s;s, and accompanied with &s;uch an Air of Conde&s;cention, as tempered the Awfulne&s;s of her Appearance, and equally in|&s;pired Love and Veneration into the Hearts of all that beheld her.</P>
<P>In the Train of the Godde&s;s of <HI>Liberty</HI> were the &s;everal Arts and Sciences, who all of them flouri&s;hed underneath her Eye. One of them in particular made a greater Figure than any of the re&s;t, who held a Thunderbolt in her Hand, which had the Power of melting, piercing, or breaking every Thing that &s;tood in its Way. The Name of this Godde&s;s was <HI>Eloquence.</HI></P>
<P>There were Two other dependent Godde&s;&s;es, who made a very con&s;picuous Figure in this bli&s;s|ful Region. The Fir&s;t of them was &s;eated upon an Hill, that had every Plant growing out of it,
<PB N="236" REF="243">
which the Soil was in its own Nature capable of producing. The Other was &s;eated in a little I&s;land, that was covered with Groves of Spices, Olives, and Orange-Trees; and in a Word, with the Products of every Foreign Clime. The Name of the Fir&s;t was <HI>Plenty,</HI> of the Second <HI>Commerce.</HI> The Fir&s;t leaned her Right Arm upon a Plough, and under her Left held a huge Horn, out of which &s;he poured a whole Autumn of Fruits. The Other wore a ro&s;tral Crown upon her Head, and kept her Eyes fixed upon a Com|pa&s;s.</P>
<P>I was wonderfully plea&s;ed in ranging through this delightful Place, and the more &s;o, becau&s;e it was not incumbered with Fences and Enclo|&s;ures; till at length, methoughts, I &s;prung from the Ground, and pitched upon the Top of an Hill, that pre&s;ented &s;everal Objects to my Sight which I had not before taken Notice of. The Winds that pa&s;s'd over this flowry Plain, and through the Tops of the Trees which were full of Blo&s;&s;oms, blew upon me in &s;uch a continued Breeze of Sweets, that I was wonderfully charm|ed with my Situation. I here &s;aw all the inner Declivities of that great Circuit of Mountains, who&s;e Out&s;ide was covered with Snow, over|grown with huge Forre&s;ts of Fir-Trees, which indeed are very frequently found in other Parts of the <HI>Alpes.</HI> The&s;e Trees were inhabited by Storks, that came thither in great Flights from very di&s;tant Quarters of the World. Methoughts, I was plea&s;ed in my Dream to &s;ee what became of the&s;e Birds, when, upon leaving the Places to which they make an annual Vi&s;it, they ri&s;e in great Flocks &s;o high till they are out of Sight; and for that Rea&s;on have been thought by &s;ome modern Philo&s;ophers to take a Flight to the Moon. But my Eyes were &s;oon diverted from this Pro&s;pect, when I ob&s;erved Two great Gaps that led thro' this Circuit of Mountains, where
<PB N="237" REF="244">
Guards and Watches were po&s;ted Day and Night. Upon Examination I found, that there were Two formidable Enemies encamped before each of the&s;e Avenues, who kept the Place in a perpetual Alarm, and watched all Opportunities of inva|ding it.</P>
<P><HI>Tyranny</HI> was at the Head of one of the&s;e Armies, dre&s;&s;ed in an Ea&s;tern Habit, and gra&s;ping in her Hand an Iron Scepter. Behind her was <HI>Barbarity,</HI> with the Garb and Complexion of an <HI>Aethiopian; Ignorance</HI> with a Turbant upon her Head; and <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> holding up a bloody Flag, embroide|red with Flower-de-Luces. The&s;e were followed by <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion, Poverty, Famine, Torture,</HI> and a dreadful Train of Appearances, that made me tremble to behold them. Among the Baggage of this Army, I could di&s;cover Racks, Wheels, Chains, and Gibbets, with all the In&s;truments Art could invent to make humane Nature mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Before the other Avenue I &s;aw <HI>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> dre&s;&s;ed in a Garment not unlike the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Ca&s;|&s;ock, and leading up an whole Army of Mon&s;ters, &s;uch as <HI>Clamour,</HI> with a hoar&s;e Voice and a Hun|dred Tongues; <HI>Confu&s;ion,</HI> with a mi&s;hapen Body and a Thou&s;and Heads; <HI>Impudence,</HI> with a Fore|head of Bra&s;s; and <HI>Rapine,</HI> with Hands of Iron. The Tumult, Noi&s;e, and Uproar in this Quarter, were &s;o very great, that they di&s;turbed my Ima|gination more than is con&s;i&s;tent with Sleep, and by that Means awaked me.</P>

<P>IN my younger Years I u&s;ed many Endeavours to get a Place at Court, and indeed conti|nued my Pur&s;uits till I arrived at my <HI>Grand Cli|macterick:</HI> But at length altogether de&s;pairing of Succe&s;s, whether it were for Want of Capacity, Friends, or due Application, I at la&s;t re&s;olved to erect a new Office, and for my Encouragement, to place my &s;elf in it. For this Rea&s;on, I took upon me the Title and Dignity of <HI>Cen&s;or</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> re&s;erving to my &s;elf all &s;uch Perqui&s;ites, Profits, and Emoluments, as &s;hould ari&s;e out of the Di&s;charge of the &s;aid Office. The&s;e in Truth have not been incon&s;iderable; for, be&s;ides tho&s;e Weekly Contributions which I receive from <HI>John Morphew,</HI> and tho&s;e annual Sub&s;criptions which I propo&s;e to my &s;elf from the mo&s;t ele|gant Part of this great I&s;land, I daily live in a very comfortable Affluence of Wine, Stale Beer, <HI>Hungary</HI> Water, Beef, Books, and Marrow-Bones, which I receive from many well-di&s;po&s;ed Citi|zens; not to mention the Forfeitures which ac|crue to me from the &s;everal Offenders that ap|pear before me on Court-Days.</P>
<P>Having now enjoyed this Office for the Space of a Twelvemonth, I &s;hall do what all good Of|ficers ought to do, take a Survey of my Beha|viour, and con&s;ider carefully, whether I have di&s;charged my Duty, and acted up to the Chara|cter with which I am inve&s;ted. For my Dire+ction
<PB N="239" REF="246">
in this Particular, I have made a narrow Search into the Nature of the old <HI>Roman Cen&s;ors,</HI> whom I mu&s;t always regard, not only as my Predece&s;&s;ors, but as my Patterns in this great Employment; and have &s;everal Times asked my own Heart with great Impartiality, Whether <HI>Cato</HI> will not bear a more venerable Figure among Po&s;terity than <HI>Bicker&s;taff.</HI></P>
<P>I find the Duty of the <HI>Roman Cen&s;or</HI> was Two|fold. The fir&s;t Part of it con&s;i&s;ted in making frequent Reviews of the People, in ca&s;ting up their Numbers, ranging them under their &s;eve|ral Tribes, di&s;po&s;ing them into proper Cla&s;&s;es, and &s;ubdividing them into their re&s;pective Cen|turies.</P>
<P>In Compliance with this Part of the Office, I have taken many curious Surveys of this great City. I have collected into particular Bodies the <HI>Dappers</HI> and the <HI>Smarts,</HI> the <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Affected Rakes,</HI> the <HI>Pretty Fellows</HI> and the <HI>very pretty Fel|lows.</HI> I have likewi&s;e drawn out in &s;everal di|&s;tinct Parties your <HI>Pedants</HI> and <HI>Men of Fire,</HI> your <HI>Game&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Politicians.</HI> I have &s;eparated <HI>Cits</HI> from <HI>Citizens, Free-Thinkers</HI> from <HI>Philo&s;ophers, Wits</HI> from <HI>Snuff-Takers,</HI> and <HI>Duelli&s;ts</HI> from <HI>Men of Honour.</HI> I have likewi&s;e made a Calculation of <HI>E&s;quires,</HI> not only con&s;idering the &s;everal di&s;tinct Swarms of them that are &s;ettled in the different Parts of this Town, but al&s;o that more rugged Species that inhabit the Fields and Woods, and are often found in Pot-hou&s;es, and upon Hay|cocks.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s the Soft Sex over in Silence, having not yet reduced them into any tolerable Order; as likewi&s;e the &s;ofter Tribe of Lovers, which will co&s;t me a great deal of Time, before I &s;hall be able to ca&s;t them into their &s;everal Centuries and Sub-divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Second Part of the <HI>Roman Cen&s;or</HI>'s Office was to look into the Manners of the People, and
<PB N="240" REF="247">
to check any growing Luxury, whether in Diet, Dre&s;s, or Building. This Duty likewi&s;e I have endeavoured to di&s;charge, by tho&s;e whole&s;ome Precepts which I have given my Countrymen in regard to Beef and Mutton, and the &s;evere Cen&s;ures which I have pa&s;&s;ed upon Ragouts and Frigacies. There is not, as I am informed, a Pair of Red Heols to be &s;een within Ten Miles of <HI>London,</HI> which I may likewi&s;e a&s;cribe, with|out Vanity, to the becoming Zeal which I ex|pre&s;&s;ed in that Particular. I mu&s;t own, my Suc|ce&s;s with the Petticoat is not &s;o great: But as I have not yet done with it, I hope I &s;hall in a little Time put an effectual Stop to that grow|ing Evil. As for the Article of Building, I in|tend hereafter to enlarge upon it, having lately ob&s;erved &s;everal Ware-hou&s;es, nay private Shops, that &s;tand upon <HI>Corinthian</HI> Pillars, and whole Rows of Tin Pots &s;howing them&s;elves, in order to their Sale, through a Sa&s;h-Window.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e followed the Example of the <HI>Roman</HI> Cen&s;ors, in puni&s;hing Offences accord|ing to the Quality of the Offender. It was u&s;ual for them to expel a Senator who had been guilty of great Immoralities out of the Senate-Hou&s;e, by omitting his Name when they called over the Li&s;t of his Brethren. In the &s;ame Manner, to remove effectually &s;everal worthle&s;s Men who &s;tand po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great Honours, I have made frequent Draughts of dead Men out of the vi|cious Part of the Nobility, and given them up to the new Society of Upholders, with the nece&s;|&s;ary Orders for their Interrment. As the <HI>Roman Cen&s;ors</HI> u&s;ed to puni&s;h the Knights or Gentlemen of <HI>Rome,</HI> by taking away their Hor&s;es from them, I have &s;ei&s;ed the Canes of many Crimi|nals of Figure, whom I had ju&s;t Rea&s;on to animadvert upon. As for the Offenders among the Common People of <HI>Rome,</HI> they were gene|rally cha&s;ti&s;ed, by being thrown out of a higher
<PB N="241" REF="248">
Tribe, and placed in one which was not &s;o ho|nourable. My Reader cannot but think I have had an Eye to this Puni&s;hment, when I have de|graded one Species of Men into Bombs, Squibs, and Crackers, and another into Drums, Ba&s;s-Viols, and Bagpipes; not to mention whole Packs of Delinquents whom I have &s;hut up in Kennels, and the new Ho&s;pital which I am at pre&s;ent erecting, for the Reception of tho&s;e my Countrymen who give me but little Hopes of their Amendment, on the Borders of <HI>Moor-Fields.</HI> I &s;hall only ob&s;erve upon this la&s;t Particular. That &s;ince &s;ome late Surveys I have taken of this I&s;land, I &s;hall think it nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge the Plan of the Buildings which I de&s;ign in this Quarter.</P>
<P>When my great Predece&s;&s;or <HI>Cato</HI> the Elder &s;tood for the Cen&s;or&s;hip of <HI>Rome,</HI> there were &s;e|veral other Competitors who offered them&s;elves; and to get an Intere&s;t among the People, gave them great Promi&s;es of the mild and gentle Treat|ment which they would u&s;e towards them in that Office. <HI>Cato</HI> on the contrary told them, he pre&s;ented him&s;elf as a Candidate, becau&s;e he knew the Age was &s;unk in Immorality and Cor|ruption; and that if they would give him their Votes, he would promi&s;e them to make u&s;e of &s;uch a Strictne&s;s and Severity of Di&s;cipline as &s;hould recover them out of it. The <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians, upon this Occa&s;ion, very much cele|brate the Publick-Spiritedne&s;s of that People, who cho&s;e <HI>Cato</HI> for their Cen&s;or, notwith&s;tand|ing his Method of recommending him&s;elf. I may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure extol my own Country|men upon the &s;ame Account, who, without any Rr&s;pect to Party, or any Application from my &s;elf, have made &s;uch generous Sub&s;criptions for the Cen&s;or of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as will give e Mag|nificence to my old Age, and which I e&s;teem more than I would any Po&s;t in <HI>Europe</HI> of an Hundred
<PB N="242" REF="249">
Times the Value. I &s;hall only add, That upon looking into my Catalogue of Sub&s;cribers, which I intend to print Alphabetically in the Front of my Lucubrations, I find the Names of the great|e&s;t Beauties and Wits in the whole I&s;land of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which I only mention for the Be|nefit of any of them who have not yet &s;ub&s;cribed, it being my De&s;ign to clo&s;e the Sub&s;cription in a very &s;hort Time.</P>

<P>I Ye&s;terday came hither about Two Hours be|fore the Company generally make their Ap|pearance, with a De&s;ign to read over all the News-Papers; but upon my &s;itting down, I was acco&s;ted by <HI>Ned Softly,</HI> who &s;aw me from a Corner in the other End of the Room, where I found he had been writing &s;omething. Mr. <HI>Bicker|&s;taff,</HI> &s;ays he, I ob&s;erve by a late Paper of yours, that you and I are ju&s;t of a Humour; for you mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t know, of all Impertinencies, there is no|thing which I &s;o much hate as News. I never read a <HI>Gazette</HI> in my Life; and never trouble
<PB N="243" REF="250">
my Head about our Armies, whether they win or lo&s;e, or in what Part of the World they he encamped. Without giving me Time to reply, he drew a Paper of Ver&s;es out of his Pocket, telling me, That he had &s;omething which would entertain me more agreeably, and that he would de&s;ire my Judgment upon every Line, for that we had Time enough before us till the Company came in.</P>
<P><HI>Ned Softly</HI> is a very pretty Poet, and a great Admirer of ea&s;y Lines. <HI>Waller</HI> is his Favourite: And as that admirable Writer has the be&s;t and wor&s;t Ver&s;es of any among our great <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets, <HI>Ned Softly</HI> has got all the bad Ones with|out Book, which he repeats upon Occa&s;ion, to &s;how his Reading, and garni&s;h his Conver&s;ation. <HI>Ned</HI> is indeed a true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader, incapable of reli&s;hing the great and ma&s;terly Strokes of this Art; but wonderfully plea&s;ed with the little <HI>Gothick</HI> Ornaments of Epigrammatical Conceits, Turns, Points, and Quibbles, which are &s;o fre|quent in the mo&s;t admired of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets, and practi&s;ed by tho&s;e who want Genius and Strength to repre&s;ent, after the Manner of the Ancients, Simplicity in its natural Beauty and Perfection.</P>
<P>Finding my &s;elf unavoidably engaged in &s;uch a Conver&s;ation, I was re&s;olved to turn my Pain into a Plea&s;ure, and to divert my &s;elf as well as I could with &s;o very odd a Fellow. You mu&s;t under&s;tand, &s;ays <HI>Ned,</HI> that the Sonnet I am go ng to read to you was written upon a Lady, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> &s;hewed me &s;ome Ver&s;es of her own making, and is perhaps the be&s;t Poet of our Age.

<L>For ah! it wounds me like his Dart.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Why, &s;ays I, this is a little No&s;egay of Con|ceits, a very Lump of Salt: Every Ver&s;e hath &s;omething in it that piques; and then the Dart in the la&s;t Line is certainly as pretty a Sting in the Tail of an Epigram (for &s;o I think your Criticks call it) as ever entered into the Thought of a Poet. Dear Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> &s;ays he, &s;haking me by the Hand, every Body knows you to be a Judge of the&s;e Things; and to tell you truly, I read over <HI>Ro&s;common</HI>'s Tran&s;lation of <HI>Horace</HI>'s <HI>Art of Poetry</HI> Three &s;everal Times, before I &s;at down to write the Sonnet which I have &s;hown you.

<Q><L>When dre&s;s'd in Lawrel Wreaths you &s;hine.</L></Q>
<P>That is, &s;ays he, when have your Garland on; when you are Writing Ver&s;es. To which I replied, I know your Meaning: A Metaphor! The &s;ame, &s;aid he, and went on.</P>
<Q><L>And tune your &s;oft melodious Notes.</L></Q>
<P>Pray ob&s;erve the Gliding of that Ver&s;e; there is &s;carce a Con&s;onant in it: I took Care to make it run upon Liquids. Give me your Opinion of

it. Truly, &s;aid I, I think it as good as the former. I am very glad to hear you &s;ay &s;o, &s;ays he; but mind the next.</P>
<Q><L>You &s;eem a Si&s;ter of the Nine.</L></Q>
<P>That is, &s;ays he, you &s;eem a Si&s;ter of the Mu&s;es; for if you look into ancient Authors, you will find it was their Opinion, that there were Nine of them. I remember it very well, &s;aid I; but pray proceed.</P>
<Q><L>Or <HI>Phoebus</HI> &s;elf in Petticoats.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Phoebus,</HI> &s;ays he, was the God of Poetry. The&s;e little In&s;tances, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> &s;how a Gentleman's Reading. Then to take off from the Air of Learning, which <HI>Phoebus</HI> and the Mu&s;es have given to this fir&s;t Stanza, you may ob&s;erve, how it falls all of a &s;udden into the Familiar; <HI>in Petticoats!</HI></P>
<Q><L>Or <HI>Phoebus</HI> &s;elf in Petticoats.</L></Q>
<P>Let us now, &s;ays I, enter upon the Second Stanza. I find the Fir&s;t Line is &s;till a Continua|tion of the Metaphor.</P>
<Q><L>I fancy, when your Song you &s;ing,</L></Q>
<P>It is very right, &s;ays he; but pray ob&s;erve the Turn of Words in tho&s;e Two Lines. I was a whole Hour in adju&s;ting of them, and have &s;till a Doubt upon me, Whether in the Second Line it &s;hould be, <HI>Your Song you &s;ing;</HI> or, <HI>You &s;ing your Song?</HI> You &s;hall hear them both:<Q><L>I fancy, when your Song you &s;ing,</L>
<L>(Your Song you &s;ing with &s;o much Art.)</L></Q>
OR,
<Q><L>I fancy, when your Song you &s;ing,</L>
<L>You &s;ing your Song with &s;o much Art.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="253">
Truly, &s;aid I, the Turn is &s;o natural either Way, that you have made me almo&s;t giddy with it. Dear Sir, &s;aid he, gra&s;ping me by the Hand, you have a great deal of Patience; but pray what do you think of the next Ver&s;e?</P>
<Q><L>Your Pen was pluck'd from Cupid's Wing.</L></Q>
<P>Think! &s;ays I; I think you have made <HI>Cupid</HI> look like a little Goo&s;e. That was my Meaning, &s;ays he; I think the Ridicule is well enough hit off But we now come to the la&s;t, which &s;ums up the whole Matter:</P>
<Q><L>For Ah! it wounds me like his Dart.</L></Q>
<P>Pray how do you like that <HI>Ah!</HI> Doth it not make a pretty Figure in that Place? <HI>Ah!</HI> It looks as if I felt the Dart, and cried out at being pricked with it.</P>
<Q><L>For Ah! it wounds me like his Dart.</L></Q>
<P>My Friend <HI>Dick Ea&s;y,</HI> continued he, a&s;&s;ured me, he would rather have written that <HI>Ah!</HI> than to have been the Author of the <HI>Aeneid.</HI> He in|deed objected, that I made <HI>Mira</HI>'s Pen like a Quill in one of the Lines, and like a Dart in the other.

He was going to embrace me for the Hint; but half a Dozen Criticks coming into the Room, who&s;e Faces he did not like, he conveyed the Sonnet into his Pocket, and whi&s;pered me in the Ear, he would &s;how it me again as &s;oon as his Man had written it over fair.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment <DATE>April 26.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE lately been looking over the many Pacquets of Letters which I have received from all Quarters of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as well as from Foreign Countries, &s;ince my entring upon the Office of <HI>Cen&s;or,</HI> and indeed am very much &s;ur|prized to &s;ee &s;o great a Number of them, and plea&s;ed to think that I have &s;o far encrea&s;ed the Revenue of the <HI>Po&s;t-Office.</HI> As this Collection will grow daily, I have dige&s;ted it into &s;everal Bundles, and made proper Endor&s;ements on each particular Letter, it being my De&s;ign, when I lay down the Work that I am now engaged in, to erect a Paper Office, and give it to the Publick.</P>
<P>I could not but make &s;everal Ob&s;ervations upon reading over the Letters of my Corre&s;pondents: As fir&s;t of all, on the different Ta&s;ts that reign in the different Parts of this City. I find, by the Approbations which are given me, That I am &s;eldom famous on the &s;ame Days on both Sides of <HI>Temple-Bar;</HI> and that when I am in the great|e&s;t Repute within the Liberties, I dwindle at the Court End of the Town. Sometimes I &s;ink in both the&s;e Places at the &s;ame Time; but for my Comfort, my Name hath then been up in the Di&s;tricts of <HI>Wapping</HI> and <HI>Rotherhithe.</HI> Some of
<PB N="248" REF="255">
my Corre&s;pondents de&s;ire me to be always &s;e|rious, and others to be always merry. Some of them entreat me to go to Bed and fall into a Dream, and like me better when I am a&s;leep than when I am awake: Others advi&s;e me to fit all Night upon the Stars, and be more fre|quent in my A&s;trological Ob&s;ervations; for that a Vi&s;ion is not properly a Lucubration. Some of my Readers thank me for filling my Paper with the Flowers of Antiquity, others de&s;ire News from <HI>Flanders.</HI> Some approve my Critici&s;ms on the Dead, and others my Cen&s;ures on the Living. For this Rea&s;on, I once re&s;olved in the new Edi|tion of my Works, to range my &s;everal Pa|pers under di&s;tinct Heads, according as their principal De&s;ign was to benefit and in&s;truct the different Capacities of my Readers, and to follow the Example of &s;ome very great Au|thors, by writing at the Head of each Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>Ad Aulam, Ad Academiam, Ad Populum, Ad Clerum.</HI></P>
<P>There is no Particular in which my Corre&s;pon|dents of all Ages, Conditions, Sexes, and Com|plexions, univer&s;ally agree, except only in their Thir&s;t after Scandal. It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive how many have recommended their Neighbours to me upon this Account, or how unmercifully I have been abu&s;ed by &s;everal unknown Hands, for not publi&s;hing the &s;ecret Hi&s;tories of Cuckol|dom that I have received from almo&s;t every Street in Town.</P>
<P>It would indeed be very dangerous for me to read over the many Prai&s;es and Eulogiums which come Po&s;t to me from all the Corners of the Nation, were they not mixed with many Checks, Reprimands, Scurrilities, and Re|proaches, which &s;everal of my good-natured Countrymen cannot forbear &s;ending me, though it often co&s;ts them Two-pence or a Groat before they can convey them to my Hands: So that
<PB N="249" REF="256">
&s;ometimes when I am put into the be&s;t Humour in the World, after having read a Panegyrick upon my Performance, and looked upon my &s;elf as a Benefactor to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, the next Letter perhaps I open, begins with, <HI>You old Do|ting Scoundrel&mdash;Are not you a &s;ad Dog&mdash;Sirrah, you de&s;erve to have your No&s;e &s;lit.</HI> And the like ingenious Conceits. The&s;e little Mortifications are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;urpa&s;s that Pride and Vanity which naturally ari&s;e in the Mind of a received Author, and enable me to bear the Reputation which my courteous Readers be&s;tow upon me, without becoming a Coxcomb by it. It was for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, that when a <HI>Roman</HI> Gene|ral entered the City in the Pomp of a Triumph, the Commonwealth allowed of &s;everal little Drawbacks to his Reputation, by conniving at &s;uch of the Rabble as repeated Libels and Lam|poons upon him within his Hearing, and by that Means engaged his Thoughts upon his Weakne&s;s and Imperfections, as well as on the Merits that advanced him to &s;o great Honours. The Con|queror however was not the le&s;s e&s;teemed for being a Man in &s;ome Particulars, becau&s;e he ap|peared as a God in others.</P>
<P>There is another Circum&s;tance in which my Countrymen have dealt very perver&s;ely with me; and that is, in Searching not only into my own Life, but al&s;o into the Lives of my Ance&s;tors. If there has been a Blot in my Family for the&s;e Ten Generations, it hath been di&s;covered by &s;ome or other of my Corre&s;pondents. In &s;hort, I find the ancient Family of the <HI>Bicker&s;taffs</HI> has &s;uffered very much through the Malice and Prejudice of my Enemies. Some of them twit me in the Teeth with the Conduct of my Aunt <HI>Margery:</HI> Nay, there are &s;ome who have been &s;o di&s;inge|nuous, as to throw <HI>Maud</HI> the Milk-Maid into my Di&s;h, notwith&s;tanding I my &s;elf was the fir&s;t who di&s;covered that Alliance. I reap however
<PB N="250" REF="257">
many Benefits from the Malice of the&s;e my Ene|mies, as they let me &s;ee my own Faults, and give me a View of my &s;elf in the wor&s;t Light; as they hinder me from being blown up by Flattery and Self-Conceit: as they make me keep a watchful Eye over my own Actions, and at the &s;ame Time make me cautious how I talk of others, and par|ticularly of my Friends and Relations, or value my &s;elf upon the Antiquity of my Family.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t formidable Part of my Corre&s;pon|dents are tho&s;e who&s;e Letters are filled with Threats and Menaces. I have been treated &s;o often after this Manner, that not thinking it &s;uf|ficient to fence well, in which I am now arrived at the utmo&s;t Perfection, and carry Pi&s;tols about me, which I have always tuck'd within my Gir|dle; I &s;everal Months &s;ince made my Will, &s;et|tled my E&s;tate, and took Leave of my Friends, looking upon my &s;elf as no better than a dead Man. Nay, I went &s;o far as to write a long Let|ter to the mo&s;t intimate Acquaintance I have in the World, under the Character of a departed Per&s;on, giving him an Account of what brought me to that untimely End, and of the Fortitude with which I met it. This Letter being too long for the pre&s;ent Paper, I intend to print it by it &s;elf very &s;uddenly; and at the &s;ame Time I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I took my Hint of it from the Be|haviour of an old Soldier in the Civil Wars, who was Corporal of a Company in a Regiment of Foot, about the &s;ame Time that I my &s;elf was a Cadet in the King's Army.</P>
<P>This Gentleman was taken by the Enemy; and the Two Parties were upon &s;uch Terms at that Time, that we did not treat each other as Pri&s;oners of War, but as Traitors and Rebels. The poor Corporal being condemned to die, wrote a Letter to his Wife when under Sentence of Exe|cution. He writ on the <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> and was to be executed on the <HI>Friday:</HI> But con&s;idering that the
<PB N="251" REF="258">
Letter would not come to his Wife's Hands till <HI>Saturday,</HI> the Day after Execution, and being at that Time more &s;crupulous than ordinary in &s;peaking exact Truth, he formed his Letter ra|ther according to the Po&s;ture of his Affairs when &s;he &s;hould read it, than as they &s;tood when he &s;ent it: Though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, there is a certain Perplexity in the Style of it, which the Reader will ea&s;ily pardon, con&s;idering his Cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<LETTER>

Before the Arrival of the next Po&s;t, that would have &s;et all Things clear, his Wife was married to a Second Husband, who lived in the peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her; and the Cor|poral, who was a Man of plain Under&s;tanding, did not care to &s;tir in the Matter, as knowing that &s;he had the News of his Death under his own Hand, which &s;he might have produced upon Occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>IT has always been my Endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h between Realities and Appearances, and to &s;e|parate true Merit from the Pretence to it. As it &s;hall ever be my Study to make Di&s;coveries of this Nature in Humane Life, and to &s;ettle the proper Di&s;tinctions between the Virtues and Per|fections of Mankind, and tho&s;e fal&s;e Colours and Re&s;emblances of them that &s;hine alike in the Eyes of the Vulgar; &s;o I &s;hall be more particu|larly careful to &s;earch into the various Merits and Pretences of the learned World. This is the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e there &s;eems to be a ge|neral Combination among the Pedants to extol one another's Labours, and cry up one another's Parts; while Men of Sen&s;e, either through that Mode&s;ty which is natural to them, or the Scorn they have for &s;uch trifling Commendations, en|joy their Stock of Knowledge like a hidden Trea|&s;ure, with Satisfaction and Silence. Pedantry in|deed in Learning is like Hypocri&s;y in Religion, a Form of Knowledge without the Power of it, that attracts the Eyes of the Common People, breaks out in Noi&s;e and Show, and finds its Re|ward not from any inward Plea&s;ure that attends it, but from the Prai&s;es and Approbations which it receives from Men.</P>
<P>Of this &s;hallow Species there is not a more im|portunate, empty, and conceited Animal, than that which is generally known by the Name of a Critick. This, in the common Acceptation of the Word, is one that, without entering into
<PB N="253" REF="260">
the Sen&s;e and Soul of an Author, has a few ge|neral Rules, which, like mechanical In&s;tru|ments, he applies to the Works of every Writer, and as they quadrate with them, pronounces the Author perfect or defective. He is Ma&s;ter of a certain Set of Words, as Unity, Style, Fire, Flegm, Ea&s;y, Natural, Turn, Sentiment, and the like; which he varies, compounds, divides, and throws together, in every Part of his Di&s;cour&s;e, without any Thought or Meaning. The Marks you may know him by are, an elevated Eye, and dogmatical Brow, a po&s;itive Voice, and a Contempt for every Thing that comes out, whe|ther he has read it or not. He dwells altogether in Generals. He prai&s;es or di&s;prai&s;es in the Lump. He &s;hakes his Head very frequently at the Pedantry of Univer&s;ities, and bur&s;ts into Laughter when you mention an Author that is not known at <HI>Will</HI>'s. He hath formed his Judg|ment upon <HI>Homer, Horace,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> not from their own Works, but from tho&s;e of <HI>Rapin</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;&s;u.</HI> He knows his own Strength &s;o well, that he never dares prai&s;e any Thing in which he has not a <HI>French</HI> Author for his Voucher.</P>
<P>With the&s;e extraordinary Talents and Accom|pli&s;hments, Sir <HI>Timothy Tittle</HI> puts Men in Vogue, or condemns them to Ob&s;curity, and &s;its as Judge of Life and Death upon every Author that ap|pears in Publick. It is impo&s;&s;ible to repre&s;ent the Pangs, Agonies, and Convul&s;ions, which Sir <HI>Ti|mothy</HI> expre&s;&s;es in every Feature of his Face, and Mu&s;cle of his Body, upon the reading of a bad Poet.</P>
<P>About a Week ago I was engaged at a Friend's of mine in an agreeable Conver&s;ation with his Wife and Daughters, when in the Height of our Mirth, Sir <HI>Timothy,</HI> who makes Love to my Friend's elde&s;t Daughter, came in among&s;t us puffing and blowing as if he had been very much out of Breath. He immediately called for a
<PB N="254" REF="261">
Chair, and de&s;ired Leave to &s;it down, without any further Ceremony. I ask'd him, Where he had been? Whether he was out of Order? He only replied, That he was quite &s;pent, and fell a cur&s;ing in Soliloquy. I could hear him cry, <HI>A Wicked Rogue&mdash;An execrable Wretch&mdash;Wat there ever &s;uch a Mon&s;ter&mdash;</HI>The young Ladies upon this began to be affrighted, and asked, Whether any one had hurt him? He an&s;wered nothing, but &s;till talked to him&s;elf. <HI>To lay the fir&s;t Scene,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>in St.</HI> James<HI>'s</HI> Park, <HI>and the la&s;t in</HI> Northampton&s;hire! Is that all, &s;ays I? Then I &s;uppo&s;e you have been at the Rehear&s;al of a Play this Morning. <HI>Been!</HI> &s;ays he; I have been at <HI>Northampton,</HI> in the <HI>Park,</HI> in a Lady's Bed Chamber, in a Dining-Room, every where; the Rogue has led me &s;uch a Dance&mdash;Tho' I could &s;carce forbear laughing at his Di&s;cour&s;e, I told him I was glad it was no wor&s;e, and that he was only Metaphorically weary. In &s;hort, Sir, &s;ays he, the Author has not ob&s;erved a &s;ingle Unity in his whole Play; the Scene &s;hifts in every Dialogue; the Villain has hurried me up and down at &s;uch a Rate, that I am tired off my Legs. I could not but ob&s;erve with &s;ome Plea|&s;ure, that the young Lady whom he made Love to, conceived a very ju&s;t Aver&s;ion towards him, upon &s;eeing him &s;o very pa&s;&s;ionate in Trifles. And as &s;he had that natural Sen&s;e which makes her a better Judge than a Thou&s;and Criticks, &s;he began to rally him upon this fooli&s;h Humour. For my Part, &s;ays &s;he, I never knew a Play take that was written up to your Rules, as you call them. How Madam! &s;ays he, Is that your Opi|nion? I am &s;ure you have a better Ta&s;t. It is a pretty Kind of Magick, &s;ays &s;he, the Poets have, to tran&s;port an Audience from Place to Place without the Help of a Coach and Hor&s;es. I could travel round the World at &s;uch a Rate. 'Tis &s;uch an Entertainment as an Enchantre&s;s finds
<PB N="255" REF="262">
when &s;he fancies her &s;elf in a Wood, or upon a Mountain, at a Fea&s;t, or a Solemnity; though at the &s;ame Time &s;he has never &s;tirred out of her Cottage. Your Simile, Madam, &s;ays Sir <HI>Timo|thy,</HI> is by no Means ju&s;t. Pray, &s;ays &s;he, let my Similies pa&s;s without a Critici&s;m. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, continued &s;he, (for I found &s;he was re|&s;olved to exa&s;perate him) I laughed very heartily at the la&s;t new Comedy which you found &s;o much Fault with. But Madam, &s;ays he, you ought not to have laughed; and I defy any one to &s;how me a &s;ingle Rule that you could laugh by. Ought not to laugh! &s;ays &s;he: Pray who &s;hould hinder me. Madam, &s;ays he, there are &s;uch People in the World as <HI>Rapin, Dacier,</HI> and &s;everal others, that ought to have &s;poiled your Mirth. I have heard, &s;ays the young Lady, That your great Criticks are always very bad Poets: I fancy there is as much Difference be|tween the Works of one and the other, as there is between the Carriage of a Dancing Ma&s;ter and a Gentleman. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, continued &s;he, I would not be troubled with &s;o fine a Judg|ment as yours is; for I find you feel more Vexa|tion in a bad Comedy, than I do in a deep Tra|gedy. Madam, &s;ays Sir <HI>Timothy,</HI> That is not my Fault, they &s;hould learn the Art of Writing. For my Part, &s;ays the young Lady, I &s;hould think the greate&s;t Art in your Writers of Come|dies is to plea&s;e. To plea&s;e! &s;ays Sir <HI>Timothy,</HI> and immediately fell a laughing. Truly, &s;ays &s;he, that is my Opinion. Upon this, he com|po&s;ed his Countenance, looked upon his Watch, and took his Leave.</P>
<P>I hear that Sir <HI>Timothy</HI> has not been at my Friend's Hou&s;e &s;ince this notable Conference, to the great Satisfaction of the young Lady, who by this Means has got rid of a very impertinent Fop.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="263">
I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I could not but ob&s;erve, with a great deal of Surprize, how this Gentleman, by his ill Nature, Folly, and Affectation, hath made him&s;elf capable of &s;uffering &s;o many ima|ginary Pains, and looking with &s;uch a &s;en&s;e|le&s;s Severity upon the common Diver&s;ions of Life.</P>

<P>THE World is &s;o overgrown with Singula|rities in Behaviour, and Method of Living, that I have no &s;ooner laid before Mankind the Ab&s;urdity of one Species of Men, but there &s;tarts up to my View &s;ome new Sect of Impertinents that had before e&s;caped Notice. This Afternoon, as I was talking with fine Mrs. <HI>Sprightly</HI>'s Por|ter, and de&s;iring Admittance upon an extraordi|nary Occa&s;ion, it was my Fate to be &s;py'd by <HI>Tom Modely</HI> riding by in his Chariot. He did me the Honour to &s;top, and asked, What I did there of a <HI>Monday?</HI> I an&s;wered, That I had Bu&s;ine&s;s of Importance, which I wanted to communicate to the Lady of the Hou&s;e. <HI>Tom</HI> is one of tho&s;e Fools who look upon Knowledge of the Fa&s;hion to be the only Liberal Science; and was &s;o rough as to tell me, That a well-bred Man would as &s;oon call upon a Lady (who keeps a Day) at Mid|night, as on any Day but that on which &s;he pro|fe&s;&s;es being at Home. There are Rules and De|corums which are never to be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed by
<PB N="257" REF="264">
tho&s;e who under&s;tand the World; and he who offends in that Kind, ought not to take it ill if he is turned away, even when he &s;ees the Per&s;on look out at her Window whom he enquires for. Nay, &s;aid he, my Lady <HI>Dimple</HI> is &s;o po&s;itive in this Rule, that &s;he takes it for a Piece of good Breeding and Di&s;tinction to deny her &s;elf with her own Mouth. Mrs. <HI>Comma,</HI> the great Scho|lar, in&s;i&s;ts upon it; and I my &s;elf have heard her a&s;&s;ert, That a Lord's Porter, or a Lady's Woman, cannot be &s;aid to lie in that Ca&s;e, becau&s;e they act by In&s;truction; and their Words are no more their own, than tho&s;e of a Puppet.</P>
<P>He was going on with this Ribaldry, when on a &s;udden he looked on his Watch, and &s;aid, ho had Twenty Vi&s;its to make, and drove away without further Ceremony. I was then at Lei|&s;ure to reflect upon the Ta&s;tle&s;s Manner of Life, which a Set of idle Fellows lead in this Town, and &s;pend Youth it &s;elf with le&s;s Spirit, than other Men do their old Age. The&s;e Expletives in Humane Society, tho' they are in them&s;elves wholly in&s;ignificant, become of &s;ome Con&s;idera|tion when they are mixed with others. I am very much at a Lo&s;s how to define, or under what Character, Di&s;tinction, or Denomination, to place them, except you give me Leave to call them the Order of the <HI>In&s;ipids.</HI> This Order is in its Extent like that of the Je&s;uits, and you &s;ee of them in every Way of Life, and in every Profe&s;&s;ion. <HI>Tom Modely</HI> has long appeared to me at the Head of this Species. By being habi|tually in the be&s;t Company, he knows perfectly well when a Coat is well cut, or a Periwig well mounted. As &s;oon as you enter the Place where he is, he tells the next Man to him who is your Taylor, and judges of you more from the Choice of your Periwig-maker than of your Friend. His Bu&s;ine&s;s in this World was to be well dre&s;&s;ed; and the greate&s;t Circum&s;tance that is to be recor|ded
<PB N="258" REF="265">
in his Annals is, That he wears Twenty Shirts a Week. Thus, without ever &s;peaking Rea&s;on among the Men, or Pa&s;&s;ion among the Women, he is every where well received; and without any one Man's E&s;teem, he has every Man's In|dulgence.</P>
<P>This Order has produced great Numbers of tolerable Copiers in Painting, good Rhimers in Poetry, and harmle&s;s Projectors in Politicks. You may &s;ee them at fir&s;t Sight grow acquainted by Sympathy, in&s;omuch that one who had not &s;tu|died Nature, and did not know the true Cau&s;e of their &s;udden Familiarities, would think that they had &s;ome &s;ecret Intimation of each other, like the Free Ma&s;ons. The other Day at <HI>Will</HI>'s, I heard <HI>Modely,</HI> and a Critick of the &s;ame Or|der, &s;how their equal Talents with great Delight. The Learned In&s;ipid was commending <HI>Racine</HI>'s Turns; the Genteel In&s;ipid, <HI>Devillier</HI>'s Curls.</P>
<P>The&s;e Creatures, when they are not forced into any particular Employment, for want of Idea's in their own Imaginations, are the con&s;tant Plague of all they meet with by Enquiries for News and Scandal, which makes them the He|roes of Vi&s;iting Days, where they help the De|&s;ign of the Meeting, which is to pa&s;s away that odious Thing called Time, in Di&s;cour&s;es too trivial to rai&s;e any Reflections which may put well-bred Per&s;ons to the Trouble of Think|ing.</P>

<P>I was looking out of my Parlour-Window this Morning, and receiving the Honours which <HI>Mar|gery,</HI> the Milk-maid to our Lane, was doing me, by dancing before my Door with the Plate of half her Cu&s;tomers on her Head, when Mr. <HI>Clay|ton,</HI> the Author of <HI>Ar&s;inoe,</HI> made me a Vi&s;it, and de&s;ired me to in&s;ert the following Adverti&s;ement in my en&s;uing Paper.</P>

<P>When I granted his Reque&s;t, I made one to him, which was, That the Performers &s;hould put their In&s;truments in Tune before the Audience came in; for that I thought the Re&s;entment of the Ea&s;tern Prince, who, according to the old Story, took <HI>Tuning</HI> for <HI>Playing,</HI> to be very ju&s;t and natural. He was &s;o civil, as not only to pro|mi&s;e that Favour, but al&s;o to a&s;&s;ure me, that he would order the Heels of the Performers to be muffled in Cotton, that the Arti&s;ts in &s;o polite an Age as ours, may not intermix with their Harmony a Cu&s;tom which &s;o nearly re&s;embles the Stamping Dances of the <HI>We&s;t-Indians</HI> or <HI>Hot|tentots.</HI></P>

read. As the rude and untaught Multitude are no Way wrought upon more effectually than by &s;eeing publick Puni&s;hments and Executions; &s;o Men of Letters and Education feel their Huma|nity mo&s;t forcibly exerci&s;ed, when they attend the Ob&s;equies of Men who had arrived at any Perfection in Liberal Accompli&s;hments. Thea|trical Action is to be e&s;teemed as &s;uch, except it be objected, that we cannot call that an Art which cannot be attained by Art. Voice, Sta|ture, Motion, and other Gifts, mu&s;t be very bountifully be&s;towed by Nature, or Labour and Indu&s;try will but pu&s;h the unhappy Endeavourer, in that Way, the further off his Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Such an Actor as Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> ought to be re|corded with the &s;ame Re&s;pect as <HI>Ro&s;cius</HI> among the <HI>Romans.</HI> The greate&s;t Orator has thought fit to quote his Judgment, and celebrate his Life. <HI>Ro&s;cius</HI> was the Example to all that would form them&s;elves into proper and winning Behaviour. His Action was &s;o well adapted to the Sentiments he expre&s;&s;ed, that the Youth of <HI>Rome</HI> thought they wanted only to be virtuous to be as graceful in their Appearance as <HI>Ro&s;cius.</HI> The Imagination took a lovely Impre&s;&s;ion of what was great and good; and they who never thought of &s;etting up for the Arts of Imitation, became them&s;elves imitable Characters.</P>
<P>There is no Humane Inventions &s;o aptly cal|culated for the forming a Free-born People as that of a Theatre. <HI>Tully</HI> reports, That the ce|lebrated Player of whom I am &s;peaking u&s;ed fre|quently to &s;ay, <HI>The Perfection of an Actor is only to become what he is doing.</HI> Young Men, who are too unattentive to receive Lectures, are irre|&s;i&s;tibly taken with Performances. Hence it is, that I extremely lament the little Reli&s;h the Gentry of this Nation have at pre&s;ent for the ju&s;t and noble Repre&s;entations in &s;ome of our Tragedies. The Opera's, which are of late in|troduced,
<PB N="262" REF="269">
can leave no Trace behind them that can be of Service beyond the pre&s;ent Moment. To &s;ing and to dance, are Accompli&s;hments very few have any Thoughts of practi&s;ing; but to &s;peak ju&s;tly, and move gracefully, is what every Man thinks he does perform, or wi&s;hes he did.</P>
<P>I have hardly a Notion, that any Performer of Antiquity could &s;urpa&s;s the Action of Mr. <HI>Better|ton</HI> in any of the Occa&s;ions in which he has appear'd on our Stage. The wonderful Agony which he ap|peared in, when he examined the Circum&s;tance of the Handkerchief in <HI>Othello;</HI> the Mixture of Love that intruded upon his Mind upon the in|nocent An&s;wers <HI>De&s;demona</HI> makes, betrayed in his Ge&s;ture &s;uch a Variety and Vici&s;&s;itude of Pa&s;|&s;ions, as would admoni&s;h a Man to be afraid of his own Heart, and perfectly convince him, that it is to &s;tab it, to admit that wor&s;t of Daggers, Jea|lou&s;y. Whoever reads in his Clo&s;et this admira|ble Scene, will find that he cannot, except he has as warm an Imagination as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> him|&s;elf, find any but dry, incoherent, and broken Sentences: But a Reader that has &s;een <HI>Bettterton</HI> act it, ob&s;erves there could not be a Word added; that longer Speech had been unnatu|ral, nay impo&s;&s;ible, in <HI>Othello</HI>'s Circum&s;tances. The charming Pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ame Tragedy, where he tells the Manner of winning the Af|fection of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, was urged with &s;o moving and graceful an Energy, that while I walked in the Cloy&s;ters, I thought of him with the &s;ame Concern as if I waited for the Remains of a Per&s;on who had in real Life done all that I had &s;een him repre&s;ent.

<P>The Mention I have here made of Mr. <HI>Better|ton,</HI> for whom I had, as long as I have known any Thing, a very great E&s;teem and Gratitude for the Plea&s;ure he gave me, can do him no Good; but it may po&s;&s;ibly be of Service to the unhappy Woman he has left behind him, to have it known, that this great Tragedian was never in a Scene half &s;o moving, as the Circum&s;tances of his Af|fairs created at his Departure. His Wife, after the Cohabitation of Forty Years in the &s;tricte&s;t Amity, has long pined away with a Sen&s;e of his Decay, as well in his Per&s;on as his little Fortune; and in Proportion to that, &s;he has her&s;elf de|cayed both in her Health and Rea&s;on. Her Husband's Death, added to her Age and Infirmi|ties, would certainly have determined her Life, but that the Greatne&s;s of her Di&s;tre&s;s has been her Relief, by a pre&s;ent Depravation of her
<PB N="264" REF="271">
Sen&s;es. This Ab&s;ence of Rea&s;on is her be&s;t De|fence again&s;t Age, Sorrow, Poverty, and Sick|ne&s;s. I dwell upon this Account &s;o di&s;tinctly, in Obedience to a certain great Spirit, who hides her Name, and has by Letter applied to me to re|commend to her &s;ome Object of Compa&s;&s;ion, from whom &s;he may be concealed.</P>
<P>This, I think, is a proper Occa&s;ion for exerting &s;uch heroick Genero&s;ity; and as there is an inge|nuous Shame in tho&s;e who have known better Fortune to be reduced to receive Obligations, as well as a becoming Pain in the truly Generous to receive Thanks in this Ca&s;e, both tho&s;e Deli|cacies are pre&s;erved; for the Per&s;on obliged is as incapable of knowing her Benefactre&s;s, as her Benefactre&s;s is unwilling to be known by her.</P>

<P>NEver was Man &s;o much teazed, or &s;uffered half the Unea&s;ine&s;s, as I have done this Evening, between a Couple of Fellows with whom I was unfortunately engaged to &s;up, where there were al&s;o &s;everal others in Company. One of them is the mo&s;t invincibly impudent, and the other as incorrigibly ab&s;urd. Upon hearing my Name, the Man of Audacity, as he calls him&s;elf, began to a&s;&s;ume an aukward Way of Re&s;erve, by Way of Ridicule upon me as a Cen&s;or, and &s;aid, He mu&s;t have a Care of his Behaviour, for there would Notes be writ upon all that &s;hould pa&s;s. The Man of Freedom and Ea&s;e (for &s;uch the other thinks him&s;elf) asked me, Whether my Si&s;ter <HI>Jenny</HI> was breeding or not? After they had done with me, they were impertinent to a very &s;mart, but well-bred Man, who &s;tood his Ground very well, and let the Company &s;ee they ought, but could not be out of Countenance. I look upon &s;uch a Defence as a real good Action; for while he received their Fire, there was a mo|de&s;t and worthy young Gentleman &s;at &s;ecure by him, and a Lady of the Family at the &s;ame Time, guarded again&s;t the nau&s;eous Familiarity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">f the one, and the more painful Mirth of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ther. This Conver&s;ation, where there were Thou&s;and Things &s;aid not worth repeating, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ade me con&s;ider with my &s;elf, How 'tis that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">en of the&s;e di&s;agreeable Characters often go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">eat Lengths in the World, and &s;eldom fail of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">t&s;tripping Men of Merit; nay, &s;ucceed &s;o
<PB N="266" REF="273">
well, that with a Load of Imperfections on their Heads, they go on in Oppo&s;ition to general Di&s;|e&s;teem, while they who are every Way their Superiors, langui&s;h away their Days, tho' po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of the Approbation and Good-will of all who know them.</P>
<P>If we would examine into the Secret Springs of Action in the Impudent and the Ab&s;urd, we &s;hall find, tho' they bear a great Re&s;emblance in their Behaviour, that they move upon very diffe|rent Principles. The Impudent are pre&s;&s;ing, tho' they know they are di&s;agreeable; the Ab&s;urd are importunate, becau&s;e they think they are ac|ceptable, Impudence is a Vice, and Ab&s;urdity a Folly. Sir <HI>Francis Bacon</HI> talks very agreeably upon the Subject of Impudence. He takes No|tice, That the Orator being asked, What was the Fir&s;t, Second, and Third Requi&s;ite, to make a fine Speaker? Still an&s;wered, <HI>Action.</HI> This, &s;aid he, is the very outward Form of Speaking, and yet it is what with the Generality has more Force than the mo&s;t con&s;ummate Abilities. Im|pudence is to the re&s;t to Mankind of the &s;ame U&s;e which Action is to Orators.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Gro&s;s of Men are governed more by Appearances than Realities, and the Im|pudent Man in his Air and Behaviour undertakes for him&s;elf that he has Ability and Merit, while the Mode&s;t or Diffident gives him&s;elf up as one who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of neither. For this Rea&s;on, Men of Front carry Things before 'em with little Oppo&s;ition, and make &s;o skilful an U&s;e of their Talent, that they can grow out of Humour like Men of Con&s;equence, and be &s;owr, and make their Di&s;&s;atisfaction do them the &s;ame Service as De&s;ert. This Way of Thinking has often furni|&s;hed me with an Apology for great Men who confer Favours on the Impudent. In carrying on the Government of Mankind, they are not to con&s;ider what Men they them&s;elves approve in
<PB N="267" REF="274">
their Clo&s;ets and private Conver&s;ations, but what Men will extend them&s;elves furthe&s;t, and more generally pa&s;s upon the World for &s;uch as their Patrons want in &s;uch and &s;uch Statious, and con|&s;equently take &s;o much Work off the Hands of tho&s;e who employ them.</P>
<P>Far be it that I &s;hould attempt to le&s;&s;en the Acceptance which Men of this Character meet with in the World; but I humbly propo&s;e only, that they who have Merit of a different Kind, would accompli&s;h them&s;elves in &s;ome Degree with this Quality of which I am now treating. Nay, I allow the&s;e Gentlemen to pre&s;s as for|ward as they plea&s;e in the Advancement of their Intere&s;ts and Fortunes, but not to intrude upon others in Conver&s;ation al&s;o: Let them do what they can with the Rich and the Great, as far as they are &s;uffered, but let them not interrupt the Ea&s;y and Agreeable. They may be u&s;eful as Ser|vants in Ambition, but never as A&s;&s;ociates in Plea&s;ure. However, as I would &s;till drive at &s;omething in&s;tructive in every Lucubration, I mu&s;t recommend it to all Men who feel in them|&s;elves an Impul&s;e towards attempting laudable Actions, to acquire &s;uch a Degree of A&s;&s;urance, as never to lo&s;e the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them&s;elves in publick or private, &s;o far as to be incapable of acting with a due Decorum on any Occa&s;ion they are call'd to. It is a mean Want of Fortitude in a good Man, not to be able to do a virtuous Action with as much Confidence as an impudent Fel|low does an ill One. There is no Way of mend|ing &s;uch fal&s;e Mode&s;ty, but by laying it down for a Rule, That there is nothing &s;hameful but what is criminal.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits, an Order who&s;e In&s;titution is per|fectly calculated for making a Progre&s;s in the World, take Care to accompli&s;h their Di&s;ciples for it, by breaking them of all impertinent Ba&s;h|fulne&s;s, and accu&s;toming them to a ready Per|formance
<PB N="268" REF="275">
of all indifferent Things. I remember in my Travels, when I was once at a publick Exer|ci&s;e in one of their Schools, a young Man made a mo&s;t admirable Speech, with all the Beauty of Action, Cadence of Voice, and Force of Argument imaginable, in Defence of the Love of Glory. We were all enamoured with the Grace of the Youth, as he came down from the Desk, where he &s;poke, to pre&s;ent a Copy of his Speech to the Head of the Society. The Principal received it in a very obliging Manner, and bid him go to the Market-Place and fetch a Joint of Meat, for he &s;hould dine with him. He bowed, and in a Trice the Orator returned, full of the Sen&s;e of Glory in this Obedience, and with the be&s;t Shoulder of Mutton in the Market.</P>
<P>This Treatment capacitates them for every Scene of Life. I therefore recommend it to the Con&s;ideration of all who have the In&s;truction of Youth, Which of the Two is the more inexcu|&s;able, he who does every Thing by the meer Force of his Impudence, or who performs no|thing through the Oppre&s;&s;ion of his Mode&s;ty? In a Word, it is a Weakne&s;s not to be able to at|tempt what a Man thinks he ought, and there is no Mode&s;ty but in Self-Denial.</P>

<P>THE Summer Sea&s;on now approaching, &s;e|veral of our Family have invited me to pa&s;s away a Month or Two in the Country, and in|deed nothing could be more agreeable to me than &s;uch a Rece&s;s, did I not con&s;ider that I am by Two Quarts a wor&s;e Companion than when I was la&s;t among my Relations: And I am admo|ni&s;hed by &s;ome of our Club, who have lately vi|&s;ited <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> that they drink at a greater Rate than they did at that Time. As every Soil does not produce every Fruit or Tree, &s;o every Vice is not the Growth of every Kind of Life; and I have, ever &s;ince I could think, been a&s;to|ni&s;hed, that Drinking &s;hould be the Vice of the Country. If it were po&s;&s;ible to add to all our Sen&s;es, as we do to that of Sight, by Per&s;pe|ctives, we &s;hould methinks more particularly labour to improve them in the mid&s;t of the Va|riety of beauteous Objects which Nature has pro|duced to entertain us in the Country; and do we in that Place de&s;troy the U&s;e of what Organs we have? As for my Part, I cannot but lament the De&s;truction that has been made of the Wild Bea&s;ts of the Field, when I &s;ee large Tracts of Earth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Men who take no Advantage
<PB N="271" REF="278">
of their being rational, but lead meer Animal Lives, making it their whole Endeavour to kill in them&s;elves all they have above Bea&s;ts; to wit, the U&s;e of Rea&s;on, and Ta&s;t of Society. It is frequently boa&s;ted in the Writings of Orators and Poets, That it is to Eloquence and Poe&s;y we owe that we are drawn out of Woods and Solitudes into Towns and Cities, and from a wild and &s;avage Being become acquainted with the Laws of Humanity and Civility. If we are obliged to the&s;e Arts for &s;o great Service, I could wi&s;h they were employed to give us a Second Turn; that as they have brought us to dwell in Society, (a Ble&s;&s;ing which no other Creatures know) &s;o they would per&s;wade us, now they have &s;ettled us, to lay out all our Thoughts in &s;urpa&s;&s;ing each other in tho&s;e Faculties in which only we excel other Creatures. But it is at pre|&s;ent &s;o far otherwi&s;e, that the Contention &s;eems to be, who &s;hall be mo&s;t eminent in Performan|ces wherein Bea&s;ts enjoy greater Abilities than we have. I'll undertake, were the Butler and Swineherd, at any true E&s;quire's in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to keep and compare Accounts of what Wa&s;h is drank up in &s;o many Hours in the Parlour and the Pig&s;ty, it would appear, the Gentleman of the Hou&s;e gives much more to his Friends than his Hogs.</P>
<P>This, with many other Evils, ari&s;es from the Error in Men's Judgments, and not making true Di&s;tinctions between Per&s;ons and Things. It is u&s;ually thought, That a few Sheets of Parch|ment, made before a Male and Female of weal|thy Hou&s;es come together, give the Heirs and De&s;cendants of that Marriage Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lands and Tenements; but the Truth is, there is no Man who can be &s;aid to be Proprietor of an E&s;tate, but he who knows how to enjoy it. Nay, it &s;hall never be allowed, that the Land is not a Wa&s;te, when the Ma&s;ter is uncultivated. There|fore,
<PB N="272" REF="279">
to avoid Confu&s;ion, it is to be noted, that a Pea&s;ant with a great E&s;tate is but an Incum|bent, and that he mu&s;t be a Gentleman to be a Landlord. A Landlord enjoys what he has with his Heart, an Incumbent with his Stomach. Gluttony, Drunkenne&s;s, and Riot, are the Enter|tainments of an Incumbent; Benevolence, Ci|vility, Social and Humane Virtues, the Accom|pli&s;hments of a Landlord. Who, that has any Pa&s;&s;ion for his native Country, does not think it wor&s;e than conquered, when &s;o large Diver&s;ions of it are in the Hands of Salvages, that know no U&s;e of Property but to be Tyrants; or Liber|ty, but to be unmannerly? A Gentleman in a Country Life enjoys Paradi&s;e with a Temper fit for it; a Clown is cur&s;ed in it with all the cut|ting and unruly Pa&s;&s;ions Man could be torment|ed with when he was expelled from it.</P>
<P>There is no Character more de&s;ervedly e&s;teem|ed than that of a Country Gentleman, who un|der&s;tands the Station in which Heaven and Na|ture have plac'd him. He is Father to his Te|nants, and Patron to his Neighbours, and is more &s;uperior to tho&s;e of lower Fortune by his Bene|volence than his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. He ju&s;tly divides his Time between Solitude and Company, &s;o as to u&s;e the one for the other. His Life is &s;pent in the good Offices of an Advocate, a Referee, a Companion, a Mediator, and a Friend. His Coun&s;el and Knowledge are a Guard to the Sim|plicity and Innocence of tho&s;e of lower Talents, and the Entertainment and Happine&s;s of tho&s;e of equal. When a Man in a Country Life has this Turn, as it is to be hoped Thou&s;ands have, he lives in a more happy Condition than any is de&s;cribed in the Pa&s;toral De&s;criptions of Poets, or the vain-glorious Solitudes recorded by Philo|&s;ophers.</P>
<P>To a Thinking Man it would &s;eem prodigious, that the very Situation in a Country Life does
<PB N="273" REF="280">
not incline Men to a Scorn of the mean Gratifi|cations &s;ome take in it. To &s;tand by a Stream, naturally lulls the Mind into Compo&s;ure and Re|verence; to walk in Shades, diver&s;ifies that Plea|&s;ure; and a bright Sun&s;hine makes a Man con|&s;ider all Nature in Gladne&s;s, and him&s;elf the happie&s;t Being in it, as he is the mo&s;t con&s;cious of her Gifts and Enjoyments. It would be the mo&s;t impertinent Piece of Pedantry imaginable to form our Plea&s;ures by Imitation of others. I will not therefore mention <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Laelius,</HI> who are generally produced on this Subject as Authorities for the Charms of a Rural Life. He that does not feel the Force of agreeable Views and Situations in his own Mind, will hardly ar|rive at the Satisfactions they bring from the Re|flexions of others. However, they who have a Ta&s;t that Way, are more particularly inflamed with De&s;ire when they &s;ee others in the Enjoy|ment of it, e&s;pecially when Men carry into the Country a Knowledge of the World as well as of Nature. The Lei&s;ure of &s;uch Per&s;ons is en|dear'd and refin'd by Reflexion upon Cares and Inquietudes. The Ab&s;ence of pa&s;t Labours dou|bles pre&s;ent Plea&s;ures, which is &s;till augmented, if the Per&s;on in Solitude has the Happine&s;s of be|ing addicted to Letters. My Cou&s;in <HI>Frank Bicker|&s;taff</HI> gives me a very good Notion of this &s;ort of Felicity in the following Letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Write this to communicate to you the Hap|pine&s;s I have in the Neighbourhood and Conver&s;ation of the noble Lord, who&s;e Health you enquired after in your la&s;t. I have bought that little Hovel which borders upon his Royal|ty; but am &s;o far from being oppre&s;&s;ed by his Greatne&s;s, that I who know no Envy, and he who is above Pride, mutually recommend our

&s;elves to each other by the Difference of our For|tunes. He e&s;teems me for being &s;o well plea&s;ed with a little, and I admire him for enjoying &s;o hand&s;omely a great deal. He has not the little Ta&s;t of ob&s;erving the Colour of a Tulip, or the Edging of a Leaf of Box, but rejoices in open Views, the Regularity of this Plantation, and the Wildne&s;s of another as well as the Fall of a River, the Ri&s;ing of a Promontory, and all other Objects fit to entertain a Mind like his, that has been long ver&s;ed in great and pu|blick Amu&s;ements. The Make of the Soul is as much &s;een in Lei&s;ure as in Bu&s;ine&s;s. He has long lived in Courts, and been admired in A&s;|&s;emblies, &s;o that he has added to Experience a mo&s;t charming Eloquence; by which he com|municates to me the Idea's of my own Mind upon the Objects we meet with, &s;o agreeably, that with his Company in the Fields, I at once enjoy the Country, and a Landskip of it. He is now altering the Cour&s;e of Canals and Ri|vulets, in which he has an Eye to his Neigh|bour's Satisfaction, as well as his own. He often makes me Pre&s;ents by turning the Water into my Grounds, and &s;ends me Fi&s;h by their own Streams. To avoid my Thanks, he makes Nature the In&s;trument of his Bounty, and does all good Offices &s;o much with the Air of a Com|panion, that his Frankne&s;s hides his own Con|de&s;cen&s;ion, as well as my Gratitude. Leave the World to it &s;elf, and come &s;ee us.</P>

<P>HAving this Morning &s;pent &s;ome Time in read|ing on the Subject of the Vici&s;&s;itude of hu|mane Life, I laid a&s;ide my Book, and began to ruminate on the Di&s;cour&s;e which rai&s;ed in me tho&s;e Reflections. I believed it a very good Of|fice to the World, to &s;it down and &s;how others the Road in which I am experienced by my Wan|drings and Errors. This is <HI>Seneca</HI>'s Way of Thinking, and he had half convinced me, how dangerous it is to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ue Happine&s;s and Tran|quility to fix our Minds upon any Thing which is in the Power of Fortune. It is excu&s;able only in Animals who have not the U&s;e of Rea&s;on, to be catched by Hooks and Baits. Wealth, Glory, and Power, which the ordinary People look up at with Admiration, the Learned and Wi&s;e know to be only &s;o many Snares laid to en&s;lave them. There is nothing further to be &s;ought for with Earne&s;tne&s;s, than what will cloath and feed us. If we pamper our &s;elves in our Diet, or give our Imaginations a Loo&s;e in our De&s;ires, the Body will no longer obey the Mind. Let us think no further than to defend our &s;elves again&s;t Hunger, Thir&s;t, and Cold. We are to remember, that every Thing el&s;e is de&s;picable, and not worth our Care. To want little is true Grandeur, and very
<PB N="276" REF="283">
few Things are great to a great Mind. Tho&s;e who form their Thoughts in this Manner, and ab|&s;tract them&s;elves from the World, are out of the Way of Fortune, and can look with Contempt both on her Favours and her Frowns. At the &s;ame Time, they who &s;eparate them&s;elves from the im|mediate Commerce with the bu&s;y Part of Man|kind, are &s;till beneficial to them, while by their Studies and Writings they recommend to them the &s;mall Value which ought to be put upon what they pur&s;ue with &s;o much Labour and Di&s;quiet. Whil&s;t &s;uch Men are thought the mo&s;t idle, they are the mo&s;t u&s;efully employed. They have all Things, both Humane and Divine, under Con&s;i|deration. To be perfectly free from the In&s;ults of Fortune, we &s;hould arm our &s;elves with their Reflections. We &s;hould learn, That none but in|tellectual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are what we can properly call our own. All Things from without are but bor|rowed. What Fortune gives us, is not ours; and whatever &s;he gives, &s;he can take away.</P>
<P>It is a common Imputation to <HI>Seneca,</HI> that tho' he declaimed with &s;o much Strength of Rea&s;on, and a Stoical Contempt of Riches and Power, he was at the &s;ame Time one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t powerful Men in <HI>Rome.</HI> I know no In&s;tance of his being in&s;olent in that Fortune, and can there|fore read his Thoughts on tho&s;e Subjects with the more Deference. I will not give Philo&s;ophy &s;o poor a Look, as to &s;ay it cannot live in Courts; but I am of Opinion, that it is there in the great|e&s;t Eminence, when amid&s;t the Affluence of All the World can be&s;tow, and the Add e&s;&s;es of a Crowd who follow him for that Rea&s;on, a Man can think both of him&s;elf and tho&s;e about him ab&s;tracted from the&s;e Circum&s;tances. Such a Phi|lo&s;opher is as much above an Anchorite, as a wi&s;e Matron, who pa&s;&s;es through the World with Inno|cence, is preferable to the Nun who locks her &s;elf up from it.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="284">
Full of the&s;e Thoughts I left my Lodgings, and took a Walk to the Court End of the Town; and the Hurry and Bu&s;y Faces I met with about <HI>White|hall,</HI> made me form to my &s;elf Ideas of the dif|ferent Pro&s;pects of all I &s;aw, from the Turn and Ca&s;t of their Countenances. All, methought, had the &s;ame Thing in View, but pro&s;ecuted their Hopes with a different Air: Some &s;howed an un|becoming Eagerne&s;s, &s;ome a &s;urly Impatience, &s;ome a winning Deference, but the Generality a &s;ervile Complai&s;ance.</P>
<P>I could not but ob&s;erve, as I roved about the Offices, That all who were &s;till but in Expecta|tion, murmured at Fortune; and all who had ob|tained their Wi&s;hes, immediately began to &s;ay, there was no &s;uch Being. Each believed it an Act of blind Chance that any other Man was prefer|red, but owed only to Service and Merit what he had obtained him&s;elf. It is the Fault of &s;tudious Men to appear in publick with too contemplative a Carriage; and I began to ob&s;erve, that my Fi|gure, Age, and Dre&s;s, made me particular: For which Rea&s;on I thought it better to remove a &s;tu|dious Countenance from among bu&s;y ones, and take a Turn with a Friend in the <HI>Privy-Garden.</HI></P>
<P>When my Friend was alone with me there, <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> &s;aid he, I know you came Abroad only to Moralize and make Ob&s;ervations, and I will car|ry you hard by, where you &s;hall &s;ee all that you have your &s;elf con&s;idered or read in Authors, or collected from Experience, concerning blind For|tune and irre&s;i&s;tible De&s;tiny, illu&s;trated in real Per&s;ons and proper Mechani&s;ms. The Graces, the Mu&s;es, the Fates, all the Beings which have a good or ill Influence upon Humane Life, are, you'l &s;ay, very ju&s;tly figured in the Per&s;ons of Women; and where I am carrying you, you'l &s;ee enough of that Sex together, in an Employment which will have &s;o important an Effect upon tho&s;e who are to receive their Manufacture, as will
<PB N="278" REF="285">
make them be re&s;pectively called Deities or Fu|ries, as their Labour &s;hall prove di&s;advantagious or &s;ucce&s;sful to their Votaries. Without waiting for my An&s;wer, he carried me to an Apartment contiguous to the <HI>Banqueting-Hou&s;e,</HI> where there were placed at Two long Tables a large Company of young Women, in decent and agreeable Ha|bits, making up Tickets for the Lottery appoint|ed by the Government. There walk'd between the Tables a Per&s;on who pre&s;ided over the Work. This Gentlewoman &s;eemed an Emblem of For|tune, &s;he commanded as if unconcerned in their Bu&s;ine&s;s; and though every Thing was performed by her Direction, &s;he did not vi&s;ibly interpo&s;e in Particulars. She &s;eemed in Pain at our near Ap|proach to her, and mo&s;t to approve us, when we made her no Advances. Her Height, her Mein, her Ge&s;ture, her Shape, and her Countenance, had &s;omething that &s;poke both Familiarity and Dignity. She therefore appeared to me not only a Picture of Fortune, but of Fortune as I liked her; which made me break out in the following Words:</P>

<P>IT has happened to be for &s;ome Days the De|liberation at the Learned'&s;t Board in this Hou&s;e, whence Honour and Title had its fir&s;t Original. <HI>Timoleon,</HI> who is very particular in his Opinions, but is thought particular for no other Cau&s;e but that he acts again&s;t depraved Cu&s;tom, by the Rules of Nature and Rea&s;on, in a very hand&s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e gave the Company to under|&s;tand,
<PB N="280" REF="287">
That in tho&s;e Ages which fir&s;t degenera|ted from Simplicity of Life, and Natural Ju&s;tice, the Wi&s;e among them thought it nece&s;&s;ary to in|&s;pire Men with the Love of Virtue, by giving them who adhered to the Intere&s;ts of Innocence and Truth, &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing Name to rai&s;e them above the common Level of Mankind. This Way of fixing Appellations of Credit upon emi|nent Merit, was what gave Being to Titles and Terms of Honour. Such a Name, continued he, without the Qualities which &s;hould give a Man Pretence to be exalted above others, does but turn him to Je&s;t and Ridicule. Should one &s;ee another cudgelled, or &s;curvily treated, Do you think a Man &s;o u&s;ed would take it kindly to be called <HI>Hector,</HI> or <HI>Alexander?</HI> Every Thing mu&s;t bear a Proportion with the outward Value that is &s;et upon it; or in&s;tead of being long had in Venera|tion, that very Term of E&s;teem will become a Word of Reproach. When <HI>Timoleon</HI> had done &s;peaking, <HI>Urbanus</HI> pur&s;ued the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, by giving an Account of the Manner in which the <HI>Indian</HI> Kings, who were lately in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> did Honour to the Per&s;on where they lodged. They were placed, &s;aid he, in an hand&s;ome Apart|ment, at an Uphol&s;terer's in <HI>King-&s;treet, Covent-Garden.</HI> The Man of the Hou&s;e, it &s;eems, had been very ob&s;ervant of them, and ready in their Service. The&s;e ju&s;t and generous Princes, who act according to the Dictates of natural Ju&s;tice, thought it proper to confer &s;ome Dignity upon their Landlord before they left his Hou&s;e. One of them had been &s;ick during his Re&s;idence there, and having never before been in a Bed, had a very great Veneration for him who made that Engine of Repo&s;e, &s;o u&s;eful and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in his Di&s;t re&s;s. It was con&s;ulted among the Four Princes' by what Name to dignify his great Me|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> and Services. The Emperor of the <HI>Mohocks,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd the other Three Kings, &s;tood up, and in that
<PB N="281" REF="288">
Po&s;ture recounted the Civilities they had recei|ved, and particularly repeated the Care which was taken of their Sick Brother. This, in their Imagination, who are u&s;ed to know the Injuries of Weather, and the Vici&s;&s;itudes of Cold and Heat, gave them very great Impre&s;&s;ions of a skil|ful Uphol&s;terer, who&s;e Furniture was &s;o well con|trived for their Protection on &s;uch Occa&s;ions. It is with the&s;e le&s;s in&s;tructed (I will not &s;ay le&s;s knowing) People, the Manner of doing Honour, to impo&s;e &s;ome Name &s;ignificant of the Qualities of the Per&s;on they di&s;tingui&s;h, and the good Of|fices received from him. It was therefore re&s;ol|ved, to call their Landlord <HI>Cadaroque,</HI> which is the Name of the &s;tronge&s;t Fort in their Part of the World. When they had agreed upon the Name, they &s;ent for their Landlord, and as he entered into their Pre&s;ence, the Emperor of the <HI>Mohocks</HI> taking him by the Hand, called him <HI>Ca|daroque.</HI> After which the other Three Princes re|peated the &s;ame Word and Ceremony.</P>
<P><HI>Timoleon</HI> appeared much &s;atisfied with this Ac|count, and having a Philo&s;ophick Turn, began to argue again&s;t the Modes and Manners of tho&s;e Nations which we e&s;teem polite, and expre&s;s him&s;elf with Di&s;dain at our unu&s;ual Method of cal|ling &s;uch as are Strangers to our Innovations, bar|barous. I have, &s;ays he, &s;o great a Deference for the Di&s;tinction given by the&s;e Princes, that <HI>Cada|roque</HI> &s;hall be my Uphol&s;terer.&mdash;He was go|ing on, but the intended Di&s;cour&s;e was interrup|ted by <HI>Minucio</HI> who &s;at near him, a &s;mall Philo|&s;opher, who is al&s;o &s;omewhat of a Politician; one of tho&s;e who &s;ets up for Knowledge by Doubt|ing, and has no other Way of making him&s;elf con&s;iderable, but by contradicting all he hears &s;aid. He has, be&s;ides much Doubt and Spirit of Contradiction, a con&s;tant Su&s;picion as to State-Affairs. This accompli&s;h'd Gentleman, with a very awful Brow, and a Countenance full of
<PB N="282" REF="289">
Weight, told <HI>Timoleon,</HI> That it was a great Mis|fortune Men of Letters &s;eldom looked into the Bottom of Things. Will any Man, continued he, per&s;wade me, that this was not from the Begin|ning to the End a concerted Affair? Who can convince the World, that Four Kings &s;hall come over here, and lie at the Two Crowns and Cu&s;hi|on, and one of them fall &s;ick, and the Place be called <HI>King-&s;treet,</HI> and all this by meer Accident? No, no: To a Man of very &s;mall Penetration, it appears, that <HI>Tee Yee Neen He Ga Row,</HI> Emperor of the <HI>Mohocks,</HI> was prepared for this Adventure beforehand. I do not care to contradict any Gentleman in his Di&s;cour&s;e; but I mu&s;t &s;ay, how|ever, <HI>Sa Ga Yeath Rua Geth Ton,</HI> and <HI>E Tow Oh Koam,</HI> might be &s;urpri&s;ed in this Matter; never|thele&s;s, <HI>He Nec Yeth Taw No Row</HI> knew it before he &s;et Foot on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Shore.</P>
<P><HI>Timoleon</HI> looked &s;tedfa&s;tly at him for &s;ome Time, then &s;haked his Head, paid for his Tea, and marched off. Several others who &s;at round him, were in their Turns attacked by this ready Di&s;putant. A Gentleman who was at &s;ome Di|&s;tance, happened in Di&s;cour&s;e to &s;ay it was Four Miles to <HI>Hammer&s;mith.</HI> I mu&s;t beg your Pardon, &s;ays <HI>Minucio,</HI> when we &s;ay a Place is &s;o far off, we do not mean exactly from the very Spot of Earth we are in, but from the Town where we are; &s;o that you mu&s;t begin your Account from the End of <HI>Piccadilly;</HI> and if you do &s;o, I'll lay any Man Ten to One, it is not above Three good Miles off. Another, about <HI>Minucio</HI>'s Level of Under&s;tanding, began to take him up in this im|portant Argument, and maintained, That con&s;i|dering the Way from <HI>Pimlico</HI> at the End of <HI>St. James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> and the Cro&s;&s;ing from <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> by <HI>Earl</HI>'s-<HI>Court,</HI> he would &s;tand to it, that it was full Four Miles. But <HI>Minucio</HI> replied with great Vehemence, and &s;eemed &s;o much to have the bet|ter of the Di&s;pute, that this Adver&s;ary quitted the
<PB N="283" REF="290">
Field, as well as the other. I &s;at till I &s;aw the Table almo&s;t all vani&s;hed, where, for Want of Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>Minucio</HI> asked me, How I did? To which I an&s;wered, Very well. That's very much, &s;aid he; I a&s;&s;ure you, you look paler than ordinary. Nay, thought I, if he won't allow me to know whether I am well or not, there's no &s;taying for me neither. Upon which I took my Leave, pon|dering as I went Home at this &s;trange Poverty of Imagination, which makes Men run into the Fault of giving Contradiction. They want in their Minds Entertainment for them&s;elves or their Company, and therefore build all they &s;peak up|on what is &s;tarted by others; and &s;ince they can|not improve that Foundation, they &s;trive to de|&s;troy it. The only Way of dealing with the&s;e People is, to an&s;wer in Mono&s;yllables, or by Way of Que&s;tion. When one of them tells you a Thing that he thinks extraordinary, I go no fur|ther than, Say you &s;o, Sir? Indeed! Heyday! Or, Is it come to that! The&s;e little Rules, which appear but &s;illy in the Repetition, have brought me with great Tranquility to this Age. And I have made it an Ob&s;ervation, that as A&s;&s;ent is more agreeable than Flattery, &s;o Contradiction is more odious than Calumny.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>May 15.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN a Man is in a &s;erious Mood, and ponders upon his own Make, with a Re|tro&s;pect to the Actions of his Life, and the many fatal Mi&s;carriages in it, which he owes to ungo|verned Pa&s;&s;ions, he is then apt to &s;ay to him&s;elf, That Experience has guarded him again&s;t &s;uch Errors for the future: But Nature often recurs in Spite of his be&s;t Re&s;olutions, and it is to the very End of our Days a Struggle between our Rea&s;on and our Temper, which &s;hall have the Empire over us. Hewever, this is very much to be help|ed by Circum&s;pection, and a con&s;tant Alarm again&s;t the fir&s;t On&s;ets of Pa&s;&s;ion. As this is in general a nece&s;&s;ary Care to make a Man's Life ea&s;y and agreeable to him&s;elf, &s;o it is more parti|cularly the Duty of &s;uch as are engaged in Friend|&s;hip and more near Commerce with others. Tho&s;e who have their Joys, have al&s;o their Griefs in Proportion, and none can extremely exalt or depre&s;s Friends, but Friends. The har&s;h Things which come from the re&s;t of the World, are re|ceived and repul&s;ed with that Spirit which every hone&s;t Man bears for his own Vindication; but Unkindne&s;s in Words or Actions among Friends, affect us at the fir&s;t In&s;tant in the inmo&s;t Rece&s;|&s;es of our Souls. Indifferent People, if I may &s;o &s;ay, can wound us only in heterogeneous Parts, maim us in our Legs or Arms; but the Friend can
<PB N="285" REF="292">
make no Pa&s;s but at the Heart it &s;elf. On the other Side, the mo&s;t impotent A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the meer well Wi&s;hes of a Friend, gives a Man Con|&s;tancy and Courage again&s;t the mo&s;t prevailing Force of his Enemies. It is here only a Man en|joys and &s;uffers to the Quick. For this Rea&s;on, the mo&s;t gentle Behaviour is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to maintain Friend&s;hip in any Degree above the com|mon Level of Acquaintance. But there is a Re|lation of Life much more near than the mo&s;t &s;trict and &s;acred Friend&s;hip, that is to &s;ay, Marriage. This Union is of too clo&s;e and delicate a Nature to be ea&s;ily conceived by tho&s;e who do not know that Condition by Experience. Here a Man &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;often his Pa&s;&s;ions; if not for his own Ea&s;e, in Compliance to a Creature formed with a Mind of a quite different Make from his own. I am &s;ure, I do not mean it an Injury to Women, when I &s;ay there is a Sort of Sex in Souls. I am tender of offending them, and know it is hard not to do it on this Subject; but I mu&s;t go on to &s;ay, That the Soul of a Man and that of a Woman, are made very unlike, according to the Employments for which they are de&s;igned. The Ladies will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, I &s;ay, our Minds have different, not &s;uperior Qualities to theirs. The Virtues have re&s;pectively a Ma&s;culine and a Feminine Ca&s;t. What we call in Men Wi&s;dom, is in Women Pru|dence. It is a Partiality to call one greater than the other. A prudent Woman is in the &s;ame Cla&s;s of Honour as a wi&s;e Man, and the Scandals in the Way of both are equally dangerous. But to make this State any Thing but a Burthen, and not hang a Weight upon our very Beings, it is very proper each of the Couple &s;hould frequent|ly remember, that there are many Things which grow out of their very Natures that are pardonable, nay becoming, when con&s;idered as &s;uch, but without that Reflection mu&s;t give the quicke&s;t Pain and Vexation. To manage well a
<PB N="286" REF="293">
great Family, is as worthy an In&s;tance of Capacity, as to execute a great Employment; and for the Generality, as Women perform the con&s;iderable Part of their Duties, as well as Men do theirs; &s;o in their common Behaviour, tho&s;e of ordinary Genius are not more trivial than the common Rate of Men; and in my Opinion, the playing of a Fan is every whit as good an Entertainment as the beating a Snuff-Box.</P>
<P>But however I have rambled in this Libertine Manner of Writing by way of E&s;&s;ay, I now &s;at down with an Intention to repre&s;ent to my Rea|ders, how pernicious, how &s;udden, and how fatal Surprizes of Pa&s;&s;ion are to the Mind of Man; and that in the more intimate Commerces of Life they are mo&s;t liable to ari&s;e, even in our mo&s;t &s;edate and indolent Hours. Occurrences of this Kind have had very terrible Effects; and when one reflects upon 'em, we cannot but tremble to con&s;ider what we are capable of being wrought up to again&s;t all the Ties of Nature, Love, Honour, Rea&s;on, and Religion, tho' the Man who breaks thro' them all, had, an Hour before he did &s;o, a lively and virtu|ous Sen&s;e of their Dictates. When unhappy Ca|ta&s;trophe's make up Part of the Hi&s;tory of Princes, and Per&s;ons who act in high Spheres, or are re|pre&s;ented in the moving Language, and well wrought Scenes of Tragedians, they do not fail of &s;triking us with Terror; but then they affect us only in a tran&s;ient Manner, and pa&s;s thro' our Ima|ginations, as Incidents in which our Fortunes are too humble to be concerned, or which Writers form for the O&s;tentation of their own Force; or, at mo&s;t, as Things fit rather to exerci&s;e the Pow|ers of our Minds, than to create new Habits in them. In&s;tead of &s;uch high Pa&s;&s;ages, I was think|ing it would be of great U&s;e (if any Body could hit it) to lay before the World &s;uch Adventures as befall Per&s;ons not exalted above the common Level. This, methought, would better prevail
<PB N="287" REF="294">
upon the ordinary Race of Men, who are &s;o pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with outward Appearances, that they mi|&s;take Fortune for Nature, and believe nothing can relate to them that does not happen to &s;uch as live and look like them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The unhappy End of a Gentleman who&s;e Story an Acquaintance of mine was ju&s;t now telling me, would be very proper for this End if it could be related with all the Circum&s;tances as I heard it this Evening; for it touched me &s;o much, that I cannot forbear entring upon it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> a young Gentleman of a good E&s;tate near <HI>Dublin</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> married a Lady of Youth, Beauty, and Mode&s;ty, and lived with her in gene|ral with much Ea&s;e and Tranquility; but was in his &s;ecret Temper impatient of Rebuke: She is apt to fall into little Sallies of Pa&s;&s;ion, yet as &s;ud|denly recalled by her own Reflection on her Fault, and the Con&s;ideration of her Husband's Temper. It happened, as he, his Wife, and her Si&s;ter, were at Supper together about Two Months ago, that in the Mid&s;t of a carele&s;s and familiar Conver&s;a|tion, the Si&s;ters fell into a little Warmth and Con|tradiction. He, who was one of that Sort of Men who are never unconcerned at what pa&s;&s;es before them, fell into an outragious Pa&s;&s;ion on the Side of the Si&s;ter. The Per&s;on about whom they di&s;puted was &s;o near, that they were under no Re&s;traint from running into vain Repetitions of pa&s;t Heats: On which Occa&s;ion all the Aggravations of Anger and Di&s;ta&s;t boiled up, and were repeated with the Bitterne&s;s of exa&s;perated Lovers. The Wife ob|&s;erving her Husband extremely moved, began to turn it off, and rally him for interpo&s;ing between Two People who from their Infancy had been an|gry and plea&s;ed with each other every Half Hour. But it de&s;cended deeper into his Thoughts, and they broke up with a &s;ullen Silence. The Wife immediately retired to her Chamber, whither her Husband &s;oon after followed. When they were
<PB N="288" REF="295">
in Bed, he &s;oon di&s;&s;embled a Sleep, and &s;he, plea|&s;ed that his Thoughts were compo&s;ed, fell into a real one. Their Apartment was very di&s;tant from the re&s;t of their Family, in a lonely Country Hou&s;e. He now &s;aw his Opportunity, and with a Dagger he had brought to Bed with him, &s;tabbed his Wife in the Side. She awaked in the highe&s;t Terrour; but immediately imagined it was a Blow de&s;ign'd for her Husband by Ruffians, began to gra&s;p him, and &s;trove to awake and rouze him to defend him|&s;elf. He &s;till pretended him&s;elf &s;leeping, and gave her a &s;econd Wound.</P>
<P>She now drew open the Curtains, and by the Help of Moon-light &s;aw his Hand lifted up to &s;tab her. The Horror di&s;armed her from further Struggling; and he enraged anew at being di&s;co|vered, fixed his Poniard in her Bo&s;om. As &s;oon as he believed he had di&s;patched her, he attempt|ed to e&s;cape out of the Window: But &s;he, &s;till alive, called to him not to hurt him&s;elf; for &s;he might live. He was &s;o &s;tung with the in&s;upport|able Reflection upon her Goodne&s;s and his own Villany, that he jumped to the Bed, and wounded her all over with as much Rage as if every Blow was provoked by new Aggravations. In this Fury of Mind he fled away. His Wife had &s;till Strength to go to her Si&s;ter's Apartment, and give her an Account of this wonderful Tragedy; but died the next Day. Some Weeks after, an Officer of Ju&s;tice, in attempting to &s;eize the Criminal, fired upon him, as did the Criminal upon the Officer. Both their Balls took Place, and both immediately expired.</P>

them in their future Lives, they are all promi&s;|cuou&s;ly in&s;tructed the &s;ame Way; and <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> mu&s;t be thrummed by a Boy as well before he goes to an Apprentice&s;hip as to the Univer|sity. This ridiculous Way of treating the Under|aged of this I&s;land has very often rai&s;ed both my Spleen and Mirth, but I think never both at once &s;o much as to Day. A good Mother of our Neighbourhood made me a Vi&s;it with her Son and Heir, a Lad &s;omewhat above Five Foot, and wants but little of the Height and Strength of a good Mu&s;quetier in any Regiment in the Service. Her Bu&s;ine&s;s was to de&s;ire I would examine him, for he was far gone in a Book, the fir&s;t Letters of which &s;he often &s;aw in my Papers. The Youth produced it, and I found it was my Friend <HI>Ho|race.</HI> It was very ea&s;y to turn to the Place the Boy was learning in, which was the Fifth Ode of the Fir&s;t Book of <HI>Pyrrha.</HI> I read it over aloud, as well becau&s;e I am always delighted when I turn to the beautiful Parts of that Author, as al&s;o to gain Time for con&s;idering a little how to keep up the Mother's Plea&s;ure in her Child, which I thought Barbarity to interrupt. In the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Place I asked him, Who this &s;ame <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> was? He an&s;wered very readily, She was the Wife of <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> one of <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Captains I lifted up my Hands. The Mother courte&s;ies&mdash;Nay, &s;ays &s;he,&mdash;I knew you would &s;tand in Admiration.&mdash;I a&s;&s;ure you, continued &s;he, for all he looks &s;o tall, he is but very young Pray ask him &s;ome more, never &s;pare him. Win that I took the Liberty to ask him, What was the Character of this Gentlewoman? He read the Three fir&s;t Ver&s;es:</P>
<Q><L>Quis multa gracilis te Puer in ro&s;a</L>
<L>Perfu&s;us liquidis urget Odoribus</L>
<L>Grate, Pyrrha, &s;ub Antro?</L></Q>
<P><PB N="291" REF="298">
And very gravely told me, She lived at the Sign of the <HI>Ro&s;e</HI> in a Cellar. I took Care to be very much a&s;toni&s;hed at the Lad's Improvements; but withal advi&s;ed her, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to take him from School, for he could learn no more there. This very &s;illy Dialogue was a lively Image of the impertinent Method u&s;ed in breeding Boys without Genius or Spirit, to the reading Things for which their Heads were never framed. But this is the natural Effect of a certain Vanity in the Minds of Parents, who are wonderfully de|lighted with the Thought of breeding their Chil|dren to Accompli&s;hments, which they believe no|thing but Want of the &s;ame Care in their own Fathers prevented them from being Ma&s;ters of. Thus it is, that the Part of Life mo&s;t fir for Im|provement, is generally 'employed in a Method again&s;t the Bent of Nature; and a Lad of &s;uch Parts as are fit for an Occupation, where there can be no Calls out of the beaten Path, is Two or Three Years of his Time wholly taken up in knowing how well <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Mi&s;tre&s;s became &s;uch a Dre&s;s; how &s;uch a Nymph for her Cruelty was changed into &s;uch an Animal; and how it is made generous in <HI>Aeneas</HI> to put <HI>Turnus</HI> to Death. Gallantries that can no more come within the Oc|currences of the Lives of ordinary Men, than they can be reli&s;hed by their Imaginations. How|ever, &s;till the Humour goes on from one Genera|tion to another; and the Pa&s;try-Cook here in the Lane the other Night told me, He would not yet take away his Son from his Learning, but has re&s;olved, as &s;oon as he had a little Smattering in the Greek, to put him Apprentice to a Soap-boyl|er. The&s;e wrong Beginnings determine our Suc|ce&s;s in the World; and when our Thoughts are originally fal&s;ly bia&s;&s;ed, their Agility and Force do but carry us the further out of our Way in Proportion to our Speed. But we are half Way our Journey when we have got into the right
<PB N="292" REF="299">
Road. If all our Days were u&s;efully employed, and we did not &s;et out impertinently, we &s;hould not have &s;o many grote&s;que Prore&s;&s;ors in all the Arts of Life, but every Man would be in a pro|per and becoming Method of di&s;tingui&s;hing or entertaining him&s;elf &s;uitably to what Nature de|&s;igned him. As they go on now, our Parents do not only force us upon what is again&s;t our Ta|lents, but our Teachers are al&s;o as injudicious in what they put us to learn. I have hardly ever &s;ince &s;uffered &s;o much by the Charms of any Beauty, as I did before I had a Sen&s;e of Pa&s;&s;ion, for not apprehending that the Smile of <HI>Lalage</HI> was what plea&s;ed <HI>Horace;</HI> and I verily believe, the Stripes I &s;uffered about <HI>Digito male p rtinaci,</HI> has given that irreconcilable Aver&s;ion, which I &s;hall carry to my Grave, again&s;t Coquets.</P>
<P>As for the elegant Writer of whom I am talk|ing, his Excellencies are to be ob&s;erved as they relate to the different Concerns of his Life; and he is always to be looked upon as a Lover, a Cour|tier, or a Man of Wit. His admirable Odes have numberle&s;s In&s;tances of his Merit in each of the&s;e Characters. His Epi&s;tles and Satyrs are full of proper Notices for the Conduct of Life in a Court; and what we call Good Breeding, mo&s;t agreeably intermixed with his Morality. His Addre&s;&s;es to the Per&s;ons who favoured him are &s;o inimitably engaging, that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> complained of him for &s;o &s;eldom writing to him, and asked him, Whether he was afraid Po&s;terity &s;hould read their Names together? Now for the Generality of Men to &s;pend much Time in &s;uch Writings, is as plea|&s;ant a Folly as any he ridicules. Whatever the Crowd of Scholars may pretend, if their Way of Life, or their own Imaginations, do not lead then to a Ta&s;t of him, they may read, nay write, Fifty Volumes upon him, and be ju&s;t as they were when they began. I remember to have heard a great Painter &s;ay, There are certain Faces for
<PB N="293" REF="300">
certain Painters, as well as certain Subjects for certain Poets. This is as true in the Choice of Studies, and no one will ever reli&s;h an Author thoroughly well, who would not have been fit Company for that Author had they lived at the &s;ame Time. All others are Mechanicks in Learn|ing, and take the Sentiments of Writers like Waiting-Servants, who report what pa&s;&s;ed at their Ma&s;ters Table; but deba&s;e every Thought and Expre&s;&s;ion, for want of the Air with which they were uttered.</P>

<P>THE Learned <HI>Scotus,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h the Race of Mankind, gives every Individual of that Species what he calls a Seity, &s;omething peculiar to him&s;elf, which makes him different from all other Per&s;ons in the World. This Particularity renders him either venerable or ridiculous, ac|cording as he u&s;es his Talents, which always grow out into Faults, or improve into Virtues. In the Office I have undertaken, you are to ob&s;erve, That I have hitherto pre&s;ented only the more in&s;ignifi|cant and lazy Part of Mankind under the Deno|mination of Dead Men, together with the De|grees towards Non-Exi&s;tence, in which others can neither be &s;aid to live or be defunct, but are only Animals meerly dre&s;&s;ed up like Men, and differ from each other but as Flies do by a little Co|louring
<PB N="294" REF="301">
or Fluttering of their Wings. Now as our Di&s;cour&s;es heretofore have chiefly regarded the Indolent Part of the Species, it remains that we do Ju&s;tice al&s;o upon the impertinently Active and Enterprizing. Such as the&s;e I &s;hall take par|ticular Care to place in &s;afe Cu&s;tody, and have u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible Diligence to run up my Edifice in <HI>Moorfields</HI> for that Service.</P>
<P>We who are adept in A&s;trology, can impute it to &s;everal Cau&s;es in the Planets, That this Quarter of our great City is the Region of &s;uch Per&s;ons as either never had, or have lo&s;t, the U&s;e of Rea&s;on. It has indeed been Time out of Mind the Recep|tacle of Fools as well as Madmen. The Care and Information of the former I a&s;&s;ign to other learned Men, who have for that End taken up their Ha|bitation in tho&s;e Parts; as, among others, to the famous Dr. <HI>Trotter,</HI> and my ingenious Friend Dr. <HI>Langham.</HI> The&s;e oraculous Proficients are Day and Night employed in deep Searches, for the Direction of &s;uch as run a&s;tray after their lo&s;t Goods: But at pre&s;ent they are more parti|cularly &s;erviceable to their Country, in foretelling the Fate of &s;uch as have Chances in the Publick Lottery. Dr. <HI>Langham</HI> &s;hows a peculiar Genero|&s;ity on this Occa&s;ion, taking only one Half-Crown for a Prediction, Eighteen Pence of which to be paid out of the Prizes; which Method the Doctor is willing to comply with in Favour of every Ad|venturer in the whole Lottery. Leaving there|fore the whole Generation of &s;uch Enquirers to &s;uch <HI>Litcrati</HI> as I have now mentioned, we are to proceed towards Peopling our Hou&s;e, which we have erected with the greate&s;t Co&s;t and Care imaginable.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary in this Place to premi&s;e, That the Superiority and Force of Mind which is born with Men of great Genius; and which, when it falls in with a noble Imagination, is called Poeti|cal Fury, does not come under my Con&s;ideration:
<PB N="295" REF="302">
but the Pretence to &s;uch an Impul&s;e without na|tural Warmth, &s;hall be allowed a fit Object of this Charity; and all the Volumes written by &s;uch Hands, &s;hall be from Time to Time placed in proper Order upon the Rails of the unhou&s;ed Book&s;ellers within the Di&s;trict of the College, (who have long inhabited this Quarter) in the &s;ame Manner as they are al eady di&s;po&s;ed &s;oon after their Publication. I promi&s;e my &s;elf from the&s;e Writings my be&s;t Opiates for tho&s;e Patients, who&s;e high Imaginations, and hot Spirits, have waked them into Di&s;traction. Their boiling Tem|pers are not to be wrought upon by my Gruels and Julips, but mu&s;t ever be employed, or appear to be &s;o, or their Recovery will be impracticable. I &s;hall therefore make U&s;e of &s;uch Poets as pre|&s;erve &s;o con&s;tant a Mediocrity, as never to elevate the Mind into Joy, or depre&s;s it into Sadne&s;s, yet at the &s;ame Time keep the Faculties of the Rea|ders in Su&s;pence, tho' they introduce no Idea's of their own. By this Means, a di&s;ordered Mind, like a broken Limb, will recover its Strength by the &s;ole Benefit of being out of U&s;e, and lying without Motion. But as Reading is not an Enter|tainment that can take up the full Time of my Patients, I have now in Pen&s;ion a proportionable Number of Story-Tellers, who are by Turns to walk about the Galleries of the Hou&s;e, and by their Narrations &s;econd the Labours of my pretty good Poets. There are among the&s;e Story-Tel|lers &s;ome that have &s;o earne&s;t Countenances, and weighty Brows, that they will draw a Madman, even when his Fit is ju&s;t coming on, into a Whi&s;|per, and by the Force of Shrugs, Nods, and bu&s;y Ge&s;tures, make him &s;tand amazed &s;o long as that we may have Time to give him his Broth without Danger.</P>
<P>But as Fortune has the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Men's Minds, a Phy&s;ician may cure all the &s;ick People of ordi|nary Degree in the whole Town and never come
<PB N="296" REF="303">
into Reputation. I &s;hall therefore begin with Per&s;ons of Condition; and the fir&s;t I &s;hall under|take, &s;hall be the Lady <HI>Fidget,</HI> the general Vi&s;itant, and <HI>Will Voluble,</HI> the fine Talker. The&s;e Per&s;ons &s;hall be fir&s;t locked up, for the Peace of all whom the one vi&s;its, and all whom the other talks to.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;ion which fir&s;t touched the Brain of both the&s;e Per&s;ons, was Envy; and has had &s;uch wondrous Effects, that to this, Lady <HI>Fidget</HI> owes that &s;he is &s;o courteous; to this, <HI>Will Voluble</HI> that he is eloquent. <HI>Fidget</HI> has a re&s;tle&s;s Torment in hearing of any one's Pro&s;perity, and cannot know any Quiet till &s;he vi&s;its her, and is Eye-Witne&s;s of &s;omething that le&s;&s;ens it. Thus her Life is a continual Search after what does not concern her, and her Companions &s;peak kindly even of the Ab&s;ent and the Unfortunate, to teaze her. She was the fir&s;t that vi&s;ited <HI>Flavia</HI> after the Small-pox, and has never &s;een her &s;ince becau&s;e &s;he is not altered. Call a young Woman hand|&s;ome in her Company, and &s;he tells you, It is pity &s;he has no Fortune: Say &s;he is rich, and &s;he is as &s;orry that &s;he is &s;illy. With all this ill Nature, <HI>Fidget</HI> is her &s;elf young, rich, and hand&s;ome; but lo&s;es the Plea&s;ure of all tho&s;e Qualities, becau&s;e &s;he has them in common with others.</P>
<P>To make up her Mi&s;ery, &s;he is well-bred, &s;he hears Commendations till &s;he is ready to faint for Want of venting her &s;elf in Contradictions. This Madne&s;s is not expre&s;&s;ed by the Voice; but is ut|tered in the Eyes and Features: Its fir&s;t Symp|tom is upon beholding an agreeable Object, a &s;udden Approbation immediately checked with Di&s;like.</P>
<P>This Lady I &s;hall take the Liberty to conduct into a Bed of Straw and Darkne&s;s, and have &s;ome Hopes, that after long Ab&s;ence from the Light, the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing at all may reconcile her to what &s;he &s;hall &s;ee, tho' it proves to be never &s;o agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="304">
My Phy&s;ical Remarks on the Di&s;traction of Envy in other Per&s;ons, and particularly in <HI>Will Voluble,</HI> is interrupted by a Vi&s;it from Mr. <HI>Kidney,</HI> with Advices which will being Matter of new Di&s;turbance to many po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this Sort of Di&s;order, which I &s;hall publi&s;h to bring out the Symptoms more kindly, and lay the Di&s;temper more open to my View.</P>

The Enemy march|ed this Morning from their Left, and are encamp|ed with their Right at <HI>Oi&s;y,</HI> and their Left to|wards <HI>Aeras,</HI> and, according to our Advices, will pa&s;s the <HI>Scarp</HI> to Morrow and enter on the Plains

<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Villars</HI> cannot yet go without Crut|ches, and 'tis believed will have much Difficulty to ride. He and the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> are to com|mand the <HI>French</HI> Army, the re&s;t of the Mare&s;chals being only to a&s;&s;i&s;t in Council.</P>

<P>IN the Di&s;tribution of the Apartments in the New <HI>Bedlam,</HI> proper Regard is had to the different Sexes, and the Lodgings accommodated accordingly. Among other Nece&s;&s;aries, as I have thought fit to appoint Story-Tellers to &s;ooth the Men, &s;o I have allowed Tale-Bearers to indulge the Intervals of my Female Patients. But before I enter upon di&s;po&s;ing of the Main of the great Body that wants my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, it is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the Humane Race ab&s;tracted from all other Di&s;tinctions and Con&s;iderations except that of Sex. This will lead us to a nearer View of their Excellencies and Imperfections, which are to be accounted the one or the other, as they are &s;uitable to the De&s;ign for which the Per&s;ons &s;o defective or accompli&s;hed came into the World.</P>
<P>To make this Enquiry aright, we mu&s;t &s;peak of the Life of People of Condition, and the pro|portionable Applications to tho&s;e below them will be ea&s;ily made, &s;o as to value the whole Spe|cies by the &s;ame Rule. We will begin with the Woman, and behold her as a Virgin in her Fa|ther's Hou&s;e. This State of her Life is infinitely more delightful than that of her Brother at the &s;ame Age. While &s;he is entertained with learn|ing melodious Airs at her Spinet, is led round a Room in the mo&s;t complai&s;ant Manner to a Fid|dle, or is entertained with Applau&s;es of her Beauty and Perfection in the ordinary Conver&s;a|tion &s;he meets with, the young Man is under the Dictates of a rigid Schoolma&s;ter or In&s;tructor.
<PB N="300" REF="307">
contradicted in every Word he &s;peaks, and curb|ed in all the Inclinations he di&s;covers. Mrs. <HI>Eli|zabeth</HI> is the Object of De&s;ire and Admiration looked upon with Delight, courted with all the Powers of Eloquence and Addre&s;s, approached with a certain Wor&s;hip, and defended with a cer|tain Loyalty. This is her Ca&s;e as to the World: In her Dome&s;tick Character, &s;he is the Compa|nion, the Friend, and Confident of her Mother, and the Object of a Plea&s;ure &s;omething like the Love between Angels, to her Father. Her Youth, her Beauty, her Air, are by him looked upon with an ineffable Tran&s;port beyond any other Joy in this Life, with as much Purity as can be met with in the next.</P>
<P>Her Brother <HI>William,</HI> at the &s;ame Years, is but in the Rudiments of tho&s;e Acqui&s;itions which mu&s;t gain him E&s;teem in the World. Hi Heart beats for Applau&s;e among Men, yet is he fearful of every Step towards it. If he propo&s;es to him|&s;elf to make a Figure in the World, his Youth is damped with a Pro&s;pect of Difficulties, Dangers, and Di&s;honours; and an Oppo&s;ition in all gene|rous Attempts, whether they regard his Love or his Ambition.</P>

He is now in all Things to act for others as well as him&s;elf. He is to have Indu&s;try and Frugality in his private Affairs, and Integrity and Addre&s;&s;es in Publick. To the&s;e Qualities, he mu&s;t add a Cou|rage and Re&s;olution to &s;upport his other Abilities, le&s;t he be interrupted in the Pro&s;ecution of his ju&s;t Endeavours, in which the Honour and In|tere&s;t

<P>This little Sketch may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure give an Idea of the different Parts which the Sexes have to act, and the advantagious as well as in|convenient Terms on which they are to enter upon their &s;everal Parts of Life.

In &s;hort, I &s;hall take it for a Maxim, That a Woman who re&s;igns the Purpo&s;e of being plea&s;ing, and the Man who gives up the Thoughts of being wi&s;e, do equally quit their Claim to the true Cau&s;es of Living; and are to be allowed the Diet and Di&s;cipline of my charitable Structure to reduce them to Rea|&s;on.</P>
<P>On the other Side, the Woman who hopes to plea&s;e by Mothods which &s;hould make her odious, and the Man who would be thought wi&s;e by a Behaviour that renders him ridiculous, are to be taken into Cu&s;tody for their fal&s;e Indu&s;try, as Ju&s;tly as they ought for their Negligence.</P>

<P>THIS Evening, after a little Ea&s;e from the raging Pain cau&s;ed by &s;o &s;mall an Organ as an aking Tooth, under which I had behaved my &s;elf &s;o ill as to have broke Two Pipes and my Spectacles, I began to reflect with Admiration on tho&s;e Heroick Spirits, which in the Conduct of their Lives &s;eem to live &s;o much above the Con|dition of our Make, as not only under the Ago|nies of Pain to forbear any intemperate Word or Ge&s;ture, but al&s;o in their general and ordinary Behaviour to re&s;i&s;t the Impul&s;es of their very Blood and Con&s;titution. This Watch over a Man's &s;elf, and the Command of his Temper, I take to be the greate&s;t of Humane Perfections, and is the Effect of a &s;trong and re&s;olute Mind. It is not only the mo&s;t expedient Practice for
<PB N="303" REF="310">
carrying on our own De&s;igns, but is al&s;o very de|&s;ervedly the mo&s;t amiable Quality in the Sight of others. It is a winning Deference to Mankind, which creates an immediate Imitation of it &s;elf wherever it appears, and prevails upon all (who have to do with a Per&s;on endued with it) either through Shame or Emulation. I do not know how to expre&s;s this Habit of Mind, except you will let me call it Equanimity. It is a Virtue, which is nece&s;&s;ary at every Hour, in every Place, and in all Conver&s;ations, and is the Effect of a regular and exact Prudence. He that will look back upon all the Acquaintances he has had in his whole Life, will find, he has &s;een more Men capable of the greate&s;t Employments and Perfor|mances, than &s;uch as could in the general Bent of their Carriage act otherwi&s;e than according to their own Complexion and Humour. But the Indulgence of our &s;elves in wholly giving Way to our natural Propen&s;ity, is &s;o unju&s;t and improper a Licence, that when People take it up, there is very little Difference, with Relation to their Friends and Families, whether they are good or ill-natured Men: For he that errs by being wrought upon by what we call the Sweetne&s;s of his Temper, is as guilty as he that offends thro' the Perver&s;ene&s;s of it.</P>
<P>It is not therefore to be regarded what Men are in them&s;elves, but what they are in their Actions. <HI>Eucrates</HI> is the be&s;t-natured of all Men; but that natural Softne&s;s has Effects quite con|trary to it &s;elf, and for Want of due Bounds to his Benevolence, while he has a Will to be a Friend to all, he has the Power of being &s;uch to none. His con&s;tant Inclination to plea&s;e, makes him never fail of doing &s;o; tho' (without being capable of Fal&s;hood) he is a Friend only to tho&s;e who are pre&s;ent; for the &s;ame Humour which makes him the be&s;t Companion, renders him the wor&s;t Corre&s;pondent. It is a melancholy Thing
<PB N="304" REF="311">
to con&s;ider, that the mo&s;t engaging Sort of Men in Conver&s;ation are frequently the mo&s;t tyranni|cal in Power, and lea&s;t to be depended upon in Friend&s;hip. It is certain this is not to be imputed to their own Di&s;po&s;ition; but he that is to be led by others, has only good Luck if he is not the wor&s;t, though in him&s;elf the be&s;t Man living. For this Rea&s;on, we are no more wholly to in|dulge our good, than our ill Di&s;po&s;itions. I re|member a crafty old Cit, one Day &s;peaking of a well-natured young Fellow who &s;et up with a good Stock in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"I will, &s;ays he, lay no more Money in his Hands, for he never de|nied me any Thing."</Q> This was a very ba&s;e, but with him a prudential Rea&s;on for breaking off Commerce: And this Acquaintance of mine car|ried this Way of Judging &s;o far, that he has often told me, he never cared to deal with a Man he liked, for that our Affections mu&s;t never enter into our Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>When we look round us in this populous City, and con&s;ider how Credit and E&s;teem are lodged, you find Men have a great Share of the former, without the lea&s;t Portion of the latter. He who knows him&s;elf for a Bea&s;t of Prey, looks upon others in the &s;ame Light, and we are &s;o apt to judge of others by our &s;elves, that the Man who has no Mercy, is as careful as po&s;&s;ible never to want it. Hence it is, that in many In&s;tances Men gain Credit by the very contrary Methods by which they do E&s;teem; for wary Traders think every Affection of the Mind a Key to their Ca&s;h.</P>
<P>But what led me into this Di&s;cour&s;e, was my Impatience of Pain; and I have, to my great Di&s;grace, &s;een an In&s;tance of the contrary Car|riage in &s;o high a Degree, that I am out of Countenance that I ever read <HI>Seneca.</HI> When I look upon the Conduct of others in &s;uch Occur|rences, as well as behold their Equanimity in the
<PB N="305" REF="312">
general Tenour of their Life, it very much abates the Self-Love, which is &s;eldom well governed by any Sort of Men, and lea&s;t of all by us Au|thors.</P>
<P>The Fortitude of a Man who brings his Will to the Obedience of his Rea&s;on, is con&s;picuous, and carries with it a Dignity in the lowe&s;t State imaginable. Poor <HI>Martius,</HI> who now lies lan|gui&s;hing in the mo&s;t violent Fever, di&s;covers in the fainte&s;t Moments of his Di&s;temper &s;uch a Greatne&s;s of Mind, that a perfect Stranger who &s;hould now behold him, would indeed &s;ee an Object of Pity, but at the &s;ame Time that it was lately an Object of Veneration. His gal|lant Spirit re&s;igns, but re&s;igns with an Air that &s;peaks a Re&s;olution which could yield to nothing but Fate it &s;elf. This is Conque&s;t in the Philo|&s;ophick Sen&s;e; but the Empire over our &s;elves is, methinks, no le&s;s laudable in common Life, where the whole Tenour of a Man's Carriage is in Sub&s;ervience to his own Rea&s;on, and Confor|mity both to the good Sen&s;e and Inclination of other Men.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;taeus</HI> is in my Opinion a perfect Ma&s;ter of him&s;elf in all Circum&s;tances. He has all the Spirit that Man can have, and yet is as regular in his Behaviour as a meer Machine. He is &s;en|&s;ible of every Pa&s;&s;ion, but ruffled by none. In Conver&s;ation, he frequently &s;eems to be le&s;s knowing to be more obliging, and chu&s;es to be on a Level with others rather than oppre&s;s with the Superiority of his Genius. In Friend&s;hip, he is kind without Profe&s;&s;ion. In Bu&s;ine&s;s, ex|peditious without O&s;tentation. With the greate&s;t Softne&s;s and Benevolence imaginable, he is im|partial in Spight of all Importunity, even that of his own good Nature. He is ever clear in his Judgment; but in Complai&s;ance to his Com|pany, &s;peaks with Doubt, and never &s;hows Con|fidence in Argument, but to &s;upport the Sen&s;e of
<PB N="306" REF="313">
another. Were &s;uch an Equality of Mind the general Endeavour of all Men, How &s;weet would be the Plea&s;ures of Conver&s;ation? He that is loud would then under&s;tand, that we ought to call a Con&s;table, and know, that &s;poiling good Company is the mo&s;t heinous Way of breaking the Peace. We &s;hould then be relieved from the&s;e Zealots in Society, who take upon them to be angry for all the Company, and quarrel with the Waiters to &s;how they have no Re&s;pect for any Body el&s;e in the Room. To be in a Rage before you, is in a Kind being angry with you. You may as well &s;tand naked before Company, as to u&s;e &s;uch Familiarities; and to be carele&s;s of what you &s;ay, is the mo&s;t clowni&s;h Way of being undre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>THE ingenious Mr. <HI>Penkethman;</HI> the Come|dian, has lately left here a Paper or Ticket, to which is affixed a &s;mall Silver Medal, which is to entitle the Bearer to &s;ee One and twenty Plays at his Theatre for a Guinea. <HI>Greenwith</HI> is the Place where, it &s;eems, he has erected h s Hou&s;e; and his Time of Action is to be &s;o contri|ved, that it is to fall in with going and returning with the Tide. Be&s;ides, that the Bearer of this Ticket may carry down with him a particular Set of Company to the Play, &s;triking off for each Per&s;on &s;o introduced one of his Twenty one Times of Admittance. In this Warrant of his, he has made me an high Compliment in a face|tious Di&s;tich, by Way of Dedication of his En|deavours, and de&s;ires I would recommend them to the World. I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, I have not for &s;ome Time &s;een a properer Choice than he has made of a Patron: Who more fit to publi&s;h his Work than a Noveli&s;t? Who to recommend it than a Cen&s;or? This Honour done me, has made me turn my Thoughts upon the Nature of Dedi|cations in general, and the Abu&s;e of that Cu|&s;tom, as well by a long Practice of my Predece&s;|&s;ors, as the continued Folly of my contemporary Authors.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="316">
In ancient Times, it was the Cu&s;tom to ad|dre&s;s their Works to &s;ome eminent for their Merit to Mankind, or particular Patronage of the Wri|ters them&s;elves, or Knowledge in the Matter of which they treated. Under the&s;e Regards, it was a memorable Honour to both Parties, and a very agreeable Record of their Commerce with each other. The&s;e Applications were never &s;tuf|fed with impertinent Prai&s;es, but were the native Product of their E&s;teem, which was implicitly re|ceived, or generally known to be due to the Patron of the Week: But vain Flouri&s;hes came into the World, with other barbarous Embelli&s;hments; and the Enumeration of Titles, and great Actions, in the Patrons them&s;elves, or their Sires, are as foreign to the Matter in Hand as the Ornaments are in a <HI>Gothick</HI> Building. This is clapping to|gether Per&s;ons which have no Manner of Alli|ance, and can for that Rea&s;on have no other Ef|fect than making both Parties ju&s;tly ridiculous. What Pretence is there in Nature for me to write to a great Man, and tell him, My Lord, becau&s;e your Grace is a Duke, your Grace's Father before you was an Earl, his Lord&s;hip's Father was a Baron, and his Lord&s;hip's Father both a wi&s;e and a rich Man; I <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff</HI> am obliged, and could not po&s;&s;ibly forbear addre&s;&s;ing to you the following Treati&s;e. Though this is the plain Expo&s;ition of all I could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay to him with a good Con&s;cience, yet the &s;illy Cu&s;tom has &s;o univer&s;ally prevailed, that my Lord Duke and I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be particular Friends from this Time forward, or el&s;e I have ju&s;t Room for be|ing di&s;obliged, and may turn my Panegyrick in|to a Libel. But to carry this Affair &s;till more Home; were it granted that Prai&s;es in Dedications were proper Topicks, What is it that gives a Man Authority to commend, or what makes it a Favour to me that he does commend me? It is certain, that there is no Prai&s;e valuable but from
<PB N="310" REF="317">
the Prai&s;e-worthy. Were it otherwi&s;e, Blame might be as much in the &s;ame Hands. Were the Good and Evil of Fame laid upon a Level among Mankind, the Judge on the Bench, and the Cri|minal at the Bar, would differ only in their Sta|tions; and if one's Word is to pa&s;s as much as the other's, their Reputation would be much alike to the Jury. <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;peaking of the Death of <HI>Martial,</HI> expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with great Gratitude to him for the Honours done him in the Writings of that Author; but he begins it with an Ac|count of his Character, whsch only made the Applau&s;e valuable. He indeed in the &s;ame Epi|&s;tle &s;ays, It is Sign we have left off doing Things which de&s;erve Prai&s;e, when we think Commendation impertinent. This is a&s;&s;erted with a ju&s;t Regard to the Per&s;ons who&s;e good Opinion we wi&s;h for; otherwi&s;e Reputation would be valued according to the Number of Voices a Man has for it, which are not always to be in&s;ured on the more virtuous Side. But how|ever we pretend to model the&s;e nice Affairs, true Glory will never attend any Thing but Truth; and there is &s;omething &s;o peculiar in it, that the very &s;elf-&s;ame Action done by different Men can|not merit the &s;ame Degree of Applau&s;e. The <HI>Roman,</HI> who was &s;urprized in the Enemy's Camp before he had accompli&s;hed his De&s;ign, and thru&s;t his bare Arm into a flaming Pile, telling the General, There were many as determined as him&s;elf who (again&s;t Sen&s;e of Danger) had con|&s;pired his Death, wrought in the very Enemy an Admiration of his Fortitude, and a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion with Applau&s;e. But the condemned Slave who repre&s;ented him in the Theatre, and con&s;umed his Arm in the &s;ame Manner, with the &s;ame Re|&s;olution, did not rai&s;e in the Spectators a great Idea of his Virtue, but of him whom imitated in an Action no Way differing from that of the real <HI>Scaevola,</HI> but in the Motive to it.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="318">
Thus true Glory is in&s;eparable from true Merit, and whatever you call Men, they are are no more than what they are in them&s;elves; but a Roman|tcik Sen&s;e has crept into the Minds of the Gene|rality, who will ever mi&s;take Words and Appear|ances for Per&s;ons and Things.</P>
<P>The Simplicity of the Ancients was as con&s;pi|cuous in the Addre&s;s of their Writings, as in any other Monuments they have left behind them. <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> were much more high Words of Re&s;pect, when added to Occa&s;ions fit for their Characters to appear in, than any Appellations which have ever been &s;ince thought of. The lat|ter of the&s;e great Men had a very plea&s;ant Way of dealing with Applications of this Kind. When he received Pieces of Poetry which he thought had Worth in them, he rewarded the Writer; but where he thought them empty, he generally returned the Compliment made him with &s;ome Ver&s;es of his own.</P>
<P>This latter Method I have at pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion to imitate. A Female Author has dedicated a Piece to me, wherein &s;he would make my Name (as &s;he has others) the Introduction of whatever is to follow in her Book; and has &s;poke &s;ome Panegyrical Things which I know not how to return, for Want of better Acquaintance with the Lady, and con&s;equently being out of a Capacity of giving her Prai&s;e or Blame. All therefore that is left for me, according to the foregoing Rules, is to lay the Picture of a good and evil Woman be|fore her Eyes, which are but meet Words if they do not concern her. Now you are to ob&s;erve, the Way in a Dedication is to make all the re&s;t of the World as little like the Per&s;on we addre&s;s to as po&s;&s;ible, according to the following Epi&s;tle:</P>

<P>WHEN we look into the delightful Hi&s;tory of the mo&s;t ingenious <HI>Don Quixot</HI> of the <HI>Mancha,</HI> and con&s;ider the Exerci&s;es and Manner of Life of that renowned Gentleman, we cannot but admire the exqui&s;ite Genius and di&s;cerning Spirit of <HI>Michael Cervantes,</HI> who has not only painted his Adventurer with great Ma&s;tery in the con&s;picuous Parts of his Story, which relate to Love and Honour, but al&s;o intimated in his ordi|nary Life, Oeconomy and Furniture, the infalli|ble Symptoms he gave of his growing Phren&s;y, before he declared him&s;elf a Knight-Errant. His Hall was furni&s;hed with old Launces, Halbards, and Morrions; his Food, Lentils; his Dre&s;s, amorous. He &s;lept moderately, ro&s;e early, and &s;pent his Time in Hunting. When by Watchful|ne&s;s and Exerci&s;e he was thus qualified for the Hard&s;hips of his intended Peregrinations, he had nothing more to do but to fall hard to &s;tudy; and before he &s;hould apply him&s;elf to the Practi|cal Part, get into the Methods of making Love and War by reading Books of Knighthood. As for rai&s;ing tender Pa&s;&s;ion in him, <HI>Cervantes</HI> re|ports, That he was wonderfully delighted with a &s;mooth intricate Sentence; and when they li&s;tened at his Study-Door, they could frequently hear him read aloud, <HI>The Rea&s;on of the Unrea&s;o|nablene&s;s, which again&s;t my Rea&s;on is wrought, doth &s;o weaken my Rea&s;on, as with all Rea&s;on I do ju&s;tly complain on your Beauty.</HI> Again, he would pau&s;e till he came to another charming Sentence,
<PB N="313" REF="320">
and with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Accent imaginable be loud at a new Paragraph: <HI>The high Heavens, which, with your Divinity, do fortify you divinely with the Stars, make you De&s;ervere&s;s of the De|&s;erts that your Greatne&s;s de&s;erves.</HI> With the&s;e, and other &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages, <HI>(&s;ay's my Author)</HI> the poor Gentleman grew di&s;tracted, and was break|ing his Brains Day and Night to under&s;tand and unravel their Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>As much as the Ca&s;e of this di&s;tempered Knight is received by all the Readers of his Hi&s;tory as the mo&s;t incurable and ridiculous of all Phren|&s;ies, it is very certain we have Crowds among us far gone in as vi&s;ible a Madne&s;s as his, though they are not ob&s;erved to be in that Condition. As great and u&s;eful Di&s;coveries are &s;ometimes made by accidental and &s;mall Beginnings, I came to the Knowledge of the mo&s;t Epidemick Ill of this Sort, by falling into a Coffee-hou&s;e where I &s;aw my Friend the Uphol&s;terer, who&s;e Crack to|wards Politicks I have heretofore mention'd.

As the Winter ingro&s;&s;es with us near a dou|ble Portion of the Year, (the Three delightful Vici&s;&s;itudes being crowded almo&s;t within the Space of Six Months) there is nothing upon which I have be&s;towed &s;o much Study and Ex|pence, as in contriving Means to &s;often the Se|verity of it, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to e&s;tabli&s;h Twelve chearful Months about my Habitation. In order to this, the Charges I have been at in building and furni&s;hing a Green-Hou&s;e, will, perhaps, be thought &s;omewhat extravagant by a great many Gentlemen who&s;e Revenues ex|ceed mine. But when I con&s;ider, that all Men of any Life and Spirit have their Inclinations to gratify, and when I compute the Sums laid out by the Generality of the Men of Plea&s;ure (in the Number of which I always rank my &s;elf) in riotous Eating and Drinking, in Equi|page and Apparel, upon Wenching, Gaming, Racing and Hunting; I find, upon the Bal|lance, that the indulging of my Humour comes at a rea&s;onable Rate.</P>
<P>Since I communicate to you all Incidents &s;e|rious and trifling, even to the Death of a But|terfly, that fall out within the Compa&s;s of my little Empire, you will not, I hope, be ill plea|&s;ed with the Draught I now &s;end you of my little Winter Paradi&s;e, and with an Account of my Way of amu&s;ing my &s;elf and others in it.</P>
<P>The younger <HI>Pliny,</HI> you know, writes a long Letter to his Friend <HI>Gallus,</HI> in which he gives him a very particular Plan of the Situation, the Conveniencies, and the Agreeablene&s;s of his Villa. In my la&s;t, you may remember, I pro|mi&s;ed you &s;omething of this Kind. Had <HI>Pliny</HI> lived in a Northern Climate, I doubt not but we &s;hould have found a very compleat Oran|gery among&s;t his Epi&s;tles; and I, probably, &s;hould have copied his Model, in&s;tead of Build|ing
<PB N="320" REF="327">
after my own Fancy, and you had been re|ferred to him for the Hi&s;tory of my late Ex|ploits in Architecture: By which Means my Performances would have made a better Figure, at lea&s;t in Writing, than they are like to make at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Area of my Green-hou&s;e is a Hundred Paces long, Fifty broad, and the Roof Thirty Foot high. The Wall toward the North is of &s;olid Stone. On the South Side, and at both the Ends, the Stone-work ri&s;es but Three Foot from the Ground, excepting the Pila&s;ters, pla|ced at convenient Di&s;tances to &s;trengthen and beautify the Building. The intermediate Spaces are filled up with large Sa&s;hes of the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t tran&s;parent Gla&s;s. The Middle Sa&s;h (which is wider than any of the other) &s;erves for the Entrance, to which you mount by Six ea&s;y Steps, and de&s;cend on the In&s;ide by as many. This opens and &s;huts with greater Ea&s;e, keeps the Wind out better, and is at the &s;ame Time more uniform than Folding-Doors.</P>
<P>In the Middle of the Roof there runs a Ciel|ing Thirty Foot broad from one End to the other. This is enlivened by a Ma&s;terly Pencil, with all the Variety of Rural Scenes and Pro|&s;pects, which he has peopled with the whole Tribe of Silvan Deities. Their Characters and their Stories are &s;o well expre&s;&s;ed, that the whole &s;eems a Collection of all the mo&s;t beau|tiful Fables of the ancient Poets tran&s;lated into Colours. The remaining Spaces of the Roof, Ten Foot on each Side of the Cieling, are of the cleare&s;t Gla&s;s, to let in the Sky and Clouds from above. The Building points full Ea&s;t and <HI>We&s;t,</HI> &s;o that I enjoy the Sun while he is about the Horizon. His Rays are improved through the Gla&s;s, and I receive through it what is de|&s;irable in a Winter-Sky, without the coar&s;e Allay of the Sea&s;on, which is a Kind of &s;ifting
<PB N="321" REF="328">
or &s;training the Weather. My Greens and Flowers are as &s;en&s;ible as I am of this Benefit: They flouri&s;h and look chearful as in the Spring, while their Fellow-Creatures abroad are &s;tar|ved to Death. I mu&s;t add, that a moderate Expence of Fire, over and above the Contribu|tions I receive from the Sun, &s;erves to keep this large Room in a due Temperature; it be|ing &s;heltered from the cold Winds by a Hill on the North, and a Wood on the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Shell, you &s;ee, is both agreeable and con|venient; and now you &s;hall judge, whether I have laid out the Floor to Advantage. There goes through the whole Length of it a &s;pacious Walk of the fine&s;t Gravel, made to bind and unite &s;o firmly, that it &s;eems one continued Stone; with this Advantage, that it is ea&s;ier to the Foot, and better for walking, than if it were what it &s;eems to be. At each End of the Walk, on the one and on the other Side of it, lies a &s;quare Plot of Gra&s;s of the fine&s;t Turf, and brighte&s;t Verdure. What Ground remains on both Sides, between the&s;e little &s;mooth Fields of Green, is flagged with large Quarries of white Marble, where the blue Veins trace out &s;uch a Variety of irregular Windings thro' the clear Surface, that the&s;e bright Plains &s;eem full of Rivulets and Streaming Meanders. This to my Eye, that delights in Simplicity, is inexpre&s;&s;ibly more beautiful, than the che|quered Floors which are &s;o generally admired by others. Upon the Right and upon the Left, along the Gravel Walk, I have ranged inter|changeably the Bay, the Mirtle, the Orange and the Lemon Trees, intermixed with painted Hollies, Silver Firs, and Pyramids of Yew; all &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that every Tree receives an additio|nal Beauty from its Situation; be&s;ides the Har|mony that ri&s;es from the Di&s;po&s;ition of the whole, no Shade cuts too &s;trongly, or breaks in

<P>The Borders of the Four Gra&s;s-Plots are gar+ni&s;hed with Pots of Flowers: Tho&s;e Delicacie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Nature recreate Two Sen&s;es at once, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> leve &s;uch delightful and gentle Impre&s;&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon the Brain, that I cannot help thinking them of equal Force with the &s;ofte&s;t Airs o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mu&s;ick, toward the &s;moothing of our Tem|pers.

<P>The North Wall would have been but a tire|&s;ome Wa&s;te to the Eye, if I had not diver&s;ified it with the mo&s;t lively Ornaments, &s;uitable to the Place. To this Intent, I have been at the Expence to lead over Arches from a neighbour|ing Hill a plentiful Store of Spring-Water, which a beautiful <HI>Naiade,</HI> placed as high as is po&s;&s;ible in the Center of the Wall, pours out from an Urn. This, by a Fall of above Twen|ty Foot, makes a mo&s;t delightful Ca&s;cade into a Ba&s;in, that opens wide within the Marble-Floor on that Side. At a rea&s;onable Di&s;tance, on either Hand of the Ca&s;cade, the Wall is hollowed into Two &s;preding Scallops, each of which receives a Couch of green Velvet, and forms at the &s;ame Time a Canopy over them. Next to them come Two large Aviaries, which are likewi&s;e let into the Stone. The&s;e are &s;ucceeded by Two Grotto's, &s;et off with all the plea&s;ing Rudene&s;s of Shells and Mo&s;s, and cragged Stones, imitating in Miniature Rocks and Precipices, the mo&s;t dreadful and gigantick Works of Nature. After the Grotto's, you have Two Niches, the one inhabited by <HI>Ceres,</HI>
<PB N="323" REF="330">
with her Sickle and Sheaf of Wheat; and the other by <HI>Pomona,</HI> who, with a Countenance full of good Cheer, pours a bounteous Autumn of Fruits out of her Horn. La&s;t of all come Two Colonies of Bees, who&s;e Stations lying Ea&s;t and We&s;t, the one is &s;aluted by the Ri|&s;ing, the other by the Setting Sun. The&s;e, all of them being placed at proportioned Intervals, furni&s;h out the whole Length of the Wall; and the Spaces that lie between are painted in Fre&s;co, by the &s;ame Hand that has enriched my Cieling.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, you &s;ee my whole Contrivance to elude the Rigour of the Year, to bring a Nor|thern Climate nearer the Sun, and to exempt my &s;elf from the common Fate of my Coun|trymen. I mu&s;t detain you a little longer, to tell you, That I never enter this delicious Re|tirement, but my Spirits are revived, and a &s;weet Complacency diffu&s;es it &s;elf over my whole Mind. And how can it be otherwi&s;e, with a Con&s;cience void of Offence, where the Mu&s;ick of Falling Waters, the Symphony of Birds, the gentle Humming of Bees, the Breath of Flowers, the fine Imagery of Painting and Sculpture: In a Word, the Beauties and the Charms of Nature and of Art court all my Faculties, refre&s;h the Fibres of the Brain, and &s;mooth every Avenue of Thought.

they them&s;elves were &s;unk in Plea&s;ures and Luxury, &s;upported at the Expence of tho&s;e very Per&s;ons whom they treated with a Negligence, as if they did not know whether they dealt with them or not. This is a very heavy Accu&s;ation, both of me and &s;uch as the Man aggrieved ac|cu&s;es me of tolerating. For this Rea&s;on, I re|&s;olved to take this Matter into Con&s;ideration, and upon very little Meditation could call to my Memory many In&s;tances which made this Com|plaint far from being groundle&s;s. The Root of this Evil does not always proceed from Inju&s;tice in the Men of Figure, but often from a fal&s;e Grandeur which they take upon them in being unacquainted with their own Bu&s;ine&s;s, not con|&s;idering how mean a Part they act when their Names and Characters are &s;ubjected to the little Arts of their Servants and Dependants. The Over&s;eers of the Poor are a People who have no great Reputation for the Di&s;charge of their Tru&s;t, but are much le&s;s &s;candalous than the Over&s;eers of the Rich. Ask a young Fellow of a great E&s;tate, Who was that odd Fellow &s;poke to him in a publick Place? He an&s;wers, One that does any Bu&s;ine&s;s. It is, with many, a natural Con&s;e|quence of being a Man of Fortune, that they are not to under&s;tand the Di&s;po&s;al of it; and they long to come to their E&s;tates, only to put them|&s;elves under new Guardian&s;hip. Nay, I have known a young Fellow who was regularly bred an Attorney, and was a very expert one till he had an E&s;tate fallen to him. The Moment that happened, he who could before prove the next Land he ca&s;t his Eye upon his own, and was &s;o &s;harp, that a Man at fir&s;t Sight would give him a &s;mall Sum for a general Receipt, whether he owed him any Thing or not: Such a one, I &s;ay, have I &s;een, upon coming to an E&s;tate, forget all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Diffidence of Mankind, and become the mo&s;t manageable Thing breathing.

to them, and think every Thing lo&s;t that pa&s;&s;es un|ob&s;erved; but others find a &s;olid Delight in &s;tealing by the Crowd, and modelling their Life after &s;uch a Manner, as is as much above the Approbation as the Practice of the Vulgar. Life being too &s;hort to give In&s;tances great enough of true Friend&s;hip or Good-Will, &s;ome Sages have thought it pious to pre&s;erve a certain Reverence for the Manes of their decea&s;ed Friends, and have withdrawn them&s;elves from the re&s;t of the World at certain Sea&s;ons, to commemorate in their own Thoughts &s;uch of their Acquaintance who have gone before them out of this Life: And indeed, when we are advanced in Years, there is not a more plea&s;ing Entertainment, than to recollect in a gloomy Moment the many we have parted with that have been dear and agree|able to us, and to ca&s;t a melancholy Thought or Two after tho&s;e with whom, perhaps, we have indulged our &s;elves in whole Nights of Mirth and Jollity. With &s;uch Inclinations in my Heart I went to my Clo&s;et ye&s;terday in the Evening and re&s;olved to be &s;orrowful; upon which Occa|&s;ion, I could not but look with Di&s;dain upon my &s;elf, that though all the Rea&s;ons which I had to lament the Lo&s;s of many of my Friends are now as forcible as at the Moment of their Departure, yet did not my Heart &s;well with the &s;ame Sor|row which I felt at that Time; but I could, without Tears, reflect upon many plea&s;ing Ad|ventures I have had with &s;ome who have long been blended with common Earth. Though it is by the Benefit of Nature that Length of Time thus blots out the Violence of Afflictions; yet with Tempers too much given to Plea&s;ure, it is almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to revive the old Places of Grief in our Memory, and ponder Step by Step on pa&s;t Life, to lead the Mind into that Sobriety of Thought which poi&s;es the Heart, and makes it beat with due Time, without being quickened

with De&s;ire, or retarded with De&s;pair, from its proper and equal Motion. When we wind up a Clock that is out of Order, to make it go well for the future, we do not immediately &s;et the Hand to the pre&s;ent In&s;tant, but we make it &s;trike the Round of all its Hours, before it can recover the Regularity of its Time. Such, thought I, &s;hall be my Method this Evening; and &s;ince it is that Day of the Year which I dedicate to the Memory of &s;uch in another Life as I much delighted in when living, an Hour or Two &s;hall be &s;acred to Sorrow and their Memory, while I run over all the melancholy Circum&s;tances of this Kind which have occurred to me in my whole Life.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Sen&s;e of Sorrow I ever knew was upon the Death of my Father, at which Time I was not quite Five Years of Age; but was rather amazed at what all the Hou&s;e meant, than po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with a real Under&s;tanding why no Body was willing to play with me. I remember I went into the Room where his Body lay, and my Mo|ther &s;ate weeping alone by it. I had my Battle|dore in my Hand, and fell a beating the Coffin, and calling Papa; for I know not how I had &s;ome &s;light Idea that he was locked up there. My Mother catched me in her Arms, and tran&s;|ported beyond all Patience of the &s;ilent Grief &s;he was before in, &s;he almo&s;t &s;mothered me in her Embrace, and told me in a Flood of Tears, Papa could not hear me, and would play with me no more, for they were going to put him un|der Ground, whence he could never come to us again. She was a very beautiful Woman, of a noble Spirit, and there was a Dignity in her Grief amid&s;t all the Wildne&s;s of her Tran&s;port, which, methought, &s;truck me with an In&s;tinct of Sorrow, which, before I was &s;en&s;ible of what it was to grieve, &s;eized my very Soul, and has made Pity the Weakne&s;s of my Heart ever &s;ince. The Mind in Infancy is, methinks, like the Body
<PB N="332" REF="339">
in Embrio, and receives Impre&s;&s;ions &s;o forcible, that they are as hard to be removed by Rea&s;on, as any Mark with which a Child is born is to be taken away by any future Application. Hence it is, that Good-Nature in me is no Merit; but having been &s;o frequently over-whelmed with her Tears before I knew the Cau&s;e of any Af|fliction, or could draw Defences from my own Judgment, I imbibed Commi&s;eration, Remor&s;e, and an unmanly Gentlene&s;s of Mind, which has &s;ince in&s;nared me into Ten Thou&s;and Calamities, and from whence I can reap no Advantage, ex|cept it be, that in &s;uch an Humour as I am now in, I can the better indulge my &s;elf, in the Soft|ne&s;&s;es of Humanity, and enjoy that &s;weet An|xiety which ari&s;es from the Memory of pa&s;t Af|flictions.</P>
<P>We that are very old, are better able to re|member Things which befel us in our di&s;tant Youth, than the Pa&s;&s;ages of later Days. For this Rea&s;on it is, that the Companions of my &s;trong and vigorous Years pre&s;ent them&s;elves more im|mediately to me in this Office of Sorrow. Un|timely or unhappy Deaths are what we are mo&s;t apt to lament, &s;o little are we able to make it in|different when a Thing happens, though we know it mu&s;t happen. Thus we groan under Life, and bewail tho&s;e who are relieved from it. Every Object that returns to our Imagination rai&s;es different Pa&s;&s;ions, according to the Circum|&s;tance of their Departure. Who can have lived in an Army, and in a &s;erious Hour reflect upon the many gay and agreeable Men that might long have flouri&s;hed in the Arts of Peace, and not join with the Imprecations of the Father|le&s;s and Widow on the Tyrant to who&s;e Ambi|tion they fell Sacrifices? But gallant Men, who are cut off by the Sword, move rather our Vene|ration than our Pity, and we gather Relief enough from their own Contempt of Death, to
<PB N="333" REF="340">
make it no Evil, which was approached with &s;o much Chearfulne&s;s, and attended with &s;o much Honour. But when we turn our Thoughts from the great Parts of Life on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, and in&s;tead of lamenting tho&s;e who &s;tood ready to give Death to tho&s;e from whom they had the Fortune to receive it; I &s;ay, when we let our Thoughts wander from &s;uch noble Objects, and con&s;ider the Havock which is made among the Tender and the Innocent, Pity enters with an unmixed Softne&s;s, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all our Souls at once.</P>
<P>Here (were there Words to expre&s;s &s;uch Senti|ments with proper Tenderne&s;s) I &s;hould record the Beauty, Innocence, and untimely Death, of the fir&s;t Object my Eyes ever beheld with Love. The beauteous Virgin! How ignorantly did &s;he charm, how carele&s;ly excel? Oh Death! Thou ha&s;t Right to the Bold, to the Ambitious, to the High, and to the Haughty; but why this Cruel|ty to the Humble, to the Meek, to the Un|di&s;cerning, to the Thoughtle&s;s? Nor Age, nor Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor Di&s;tre&s;s, can era&s;e the dear Image from my Imagination. In the &s;ame Week, I &s;aw her dre&s;&s;ed for a Ball, and in a Shrowd. How ill did the Habit of Death become the Prerty Trifler? I &s;till behold the &s;miling Earth&mdash;A large Train of Di&s;a&s;ters were coming on to my Memory, when my Servant knocked at my Clo&s;er Door, and interrupted me with a Letter, attended with a Hamper of Wine, of the &s;ame Sort with that which is to be put to Sale on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> next at <HI>Garraway</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e. Upon the Receipt of it, I &s;ent for Three of my Friends. We are &s;o intimate, that we can be Company in whatever State of Mind we meet, and can enter|tain each other without expecting always to re|joice. The Wine we found to be generous and warming, but with &s;uch an Heat as moved us rather to be chearful than frolick&s;ome. It re|vived

the Spirits without firing the Blood. We commended it till Two of the Clock this Morn|ing, and having to Day met a little before Din|ner, we found, that though we drank Two Bottles a Man, we had much more Rea&s;on to recollect than forget what had pa&s;&s;ed the Night before.</P>

<P>THE Town grows &s;o very empty, that the greater Number of my gay Character are fled out of my Sight into the Country. My <HI>Beaus</HI> are now Shepherds, and my <HI>Belles</HI> Wood Nymphs.

<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be imagined by &s;evere Men, that I am too frequent in the Mention of the Theatrical Repre&s;entations; But who is not ex|ce&s;&s;ive in the Di&s;cour&s;e of what he extremely likes? <HI>Eugenio</HI> can lead you to a Gallery of fine Pictures, which Collection he is always increa|&s;ing: <HI>Cra&s;&s;us</HI> through Woods and Forre&s;ts, to which he de&s;igns to add the neighbouring Coun|ties. The&s;e are great and noble In&s;tances of their Magnificence. The Players are my Pi|ctures, and their Scenes my Territories. By com|municating the Plea&s;ure I take in them, it may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure add to Men's Gratifications this Way, as viewing the Choice and Wealth of <HI>En|genio</HI> and <HI>Cra&s;&s;us</HI> augments the Enjoyments of tho&s;e whom they entertain, with a Pro&s;pect of &s;uch Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions as would not otherwi&s;e fall with|in the Reach of their Fortunes.</P>
<P>It is a very good Office one Man does another when he tells him the Manner of his being plea|&s;ed; and I have often thought, that a Com|ment upon the Capacities of the Players would very much improve the Delight that Way, and impart it to tho&s;e who otherwi&s;e have no Sen&s;e of it.</P>

<P>WHEN Men look into their own Bo&s;oms, and con&s;ider the generous Seeds which are there planted, that might, if rightly cultiva|ted, ennoble their Lives, and make their Virtue venerable to Futurity; How can they, without Tears, reflect on the univer&s;al Degeneracy from that publick Spirit, which ought to be the fir&s;t and principal Motive of all their Actions? In the <HI>Graecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Nations, they were wi&s;e enough to keep up this great Incentive, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to be in the Fa&s;hion without be|ing a Patriot. All Gallantry had its fir&s;t Source from hence; and to want a Warmth for the Pu|blick Welfare, was a Defect &s;o &s;candalous, that he who was guilty of it had no Pretence to Ho|nour or Manhood. What makes the Depravity among us in this Behalf the more vexatious and irk&s;ome to reflect upon, is, that the Contempt of Life is carried as far among&s;t us, as it could be in tho&s;e memorable People; and we want only a proper Application of the Qualities which are frequent among us to be as worthy as they. There is hardly a Man to be found who will not light upon any Occa&s;ion which he thinks may taint his own Honour. Were this Motive as &s;trong in every Thing that regards the Publick, as it is in this our private Ca&s;e, no Man would

But it is &s;o far otherwi&s;e, that there cannot at pre&s;ent be a more ridiculous Ani|mal than one who &s;eems to regard the Good of others. He in Civil Life who&s;e Thoughts turn upon Schemes which may be of general Benefit, without further Reflection, is call'd a Projector; and the Man who&s;e Mind &s;eems intent upon glo|rious Atchievements, a Knight Errant. The Ri|dicule among us runs &s;trong again&s;t laudable Actions. Nay, in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Things and the common Regards of Life, Negligence of the Publick is an Epidemick Vice. The Brewer in his Exci&s;e, the Merchant in his Cu|&s;toms, and for ought we know the Soldier in his Mu&s;ter-Rolls, think never the wor&s;e of them|&s;elves for being guilty of their re&s;pective Fraud towards the Publick. This Evil is come to &s;uch a phanta&s;tical Height, that he is a Man of a pub+lick Spirit, and heroically affected to his Coun+try, who can go &s;o far as even to turn U&s;ure with all he has in her Funds.

This ef|faces not only the Practice, but the very Appro|bation of Honour and Virtue; and has had &s;uch an Effect, that to &s;peak freely, the very Sen&s;e of Publick Good has no longer a Part even in our Conver&s;ations. Can then the mo&s;t generous Mo|tive of Life, the Good of others, be &s;o ea&s;ily bani&s;h'd the Brea&s;t of Man? Is it po&s;&s;ible to draw all our Pa&s;&s;ions inward?

This certainly is the Te&s;t of Merit; and the fir&s;t Foundation for de&s;erving Good Will, is having it your &s;elf.

<P>THere are certain Occa&s;ions of Life which give propitious Omens of the future good Conduct of it, as well as others which explain our pre&s;ent inward State, according to our Beha|viour in them. Of the latter Sort are Funerals; of the former, Weddings. The Manner of our Carriage when we lo&s;e a Friend, &s;hows very much our Temper, in the Humility of our Words and Actions, and a general Sen&s;e of our de&s;titute Condition, which runs through all our Deport|ment. This gives a &s;olemn Te&s;timony of the ge|nerous Affection we bore our Friends, when we
<PB N="344" REF="351">
&s;eem to di&s;reli&s;h every Thing now we can no more enjoy them, or &s;ee them partake in our En|joyments. It is very proper and humane to put our &s;elves as it were in their Livery after their Decea&s;e, and wear a Habit un&s;uitable to Pro&s;perity, while tho&s;e we loved and honoured are mouldring in the Grave. As this is laudable on the &s;orrowful Side; &s;o on the other, Incidents of Succe&s;s may no le&s;s ju&s;tly be repre&s;ented and acknowledged in our outward Figure and Carriage. Of all &s;uch Occa&s;ions, that great Change of a Single Life into Marriage is the mo&s;t important, as it is the Source of all Relations, and from whence all other Friend&s;hip and Commerce do principally ari&s;e. The general Intent of both Sexes is to di&s;|po&s;e of them&s;elves happily and honourably in this State; and as all the good Qualities we have are exerted to make our Way into it, &s;o the be&s;t Ap|pearance, with Regard to their Minds, their Per|&s;ons, and their Fortunes, at the fir&s;t Entrance in|to it, is a Due to each other in the married Pair, as well as a Compliment to the re&s;t of the World. It was an In&s;truction of a wi&s;e Law-giver. That unmarried Women &s;hould wear &s;uch loo&s;e Habits, which, in the flowing of their Garb, &s;hould incite their Beholders to a De&s;ire of their Per&s;ons; and that the ordinary Motion of their Bodies might di&s;play the Figure and Shape of their Limbs in &s;uch a Manner, as at once to pre&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t Decency, and rai&s;e the warme&s;t Inclina|tions.</P>
<P>This was the Oeconomy of the Legi&s;lator for the Increa&s;e of People, and at the &s;ame Time for the Pre&s;ervation of the Genial Bed. She who was the Admiration of all who beheld her while unmarried, was to bid adieu to the Plea&s;ure of &s;hining in the Eyes of many, as &s;oon as &s;he took upon her the wedded Condition. However, there was a Fe&s;tival of Life allowed the New|married, a Sort of intermediate State between
<PB N="345" REF="352">
Celibacy and Matrimony, which continued cer|tain Days. During that Time, Entertainments, Equipages, and other Circum&s;tances of Rejoi|cing, were encouraged, and they were permitted to exceed the common Mode of Living, that the Bride and Bridegroom might learn from &s;uch Free|doms of Conver&s;ation to run into a general Con|duct to each other, made out of their pa&s;t and future State, &s;o to temper the Cares of the Man and the Wife with the Gieties of the Lover and Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e wi&s;e Ages the Dignity of Life was kept up, and on the Celebration of &s;uch Solem|nities there were no impertinent Whi&s;pers and &s;en&s;ele&s;s Interpretations put upon the unaffected Chearfulne&s;s or accidental Seriou&s;ne&s;s of the Bride; but Men turn'd their Thoughts upon the general Reflections, upon what I&s;&s;ue might probably be expected from &s;uch a Couple in the &s;ucceeding Cour&s;e of their Life, and felicitated them accor|dingly upon &s;uch Pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I cannot from any ancient Ma|nu&s;cripts, Sculptures, or Medals, deduce the Ri&s;e of our celebrated Cu&s;tom of throwing the Stock|ing; but have a faint Memory of an Account a Friend gave me of an original Picture in the Pa|lace of <HI>Aldobrandini</HI> in <HI>Rome.</HI> This &s;eems to &s;how a Sen&s;e of this Affair very different from what is u&s;ual among us. It is a <HI>Grecian</HI> Wed|ding, and the Figures repre&s;ented are, a Per&s;on offering Sacrifice, a beautiful Dam&s;el dancing, and another playing on the Harp. The Bride is placed in her Bed, the Bridegroom &s;its at the Feet of it, with an A&s;pect which intimates, his Thoughts were not only entertained with the Joys with which he was &s;urrounded, but al&s;o with a noble Gratitude, and Divine Plea&s;ure in the Offering, which was then made to the Gods to invoke their influence on his new Condition. There appears in the Face of the Woman a Mixture of Fear,
<PB N="346" REF="353">
Hope, and Mode&s;ty; in the Bridegroom, a well|governed Rapture. As you &s;ee in great Spirits, Grief which di&s;covers it &s;elf the more by for|bearing Tears and Complaints, you may ob&s;erve al&s;o the highe&s;t Joy is too big for Utterance, the Tongue being of all the Organs the lea&s;t capable of expre&s;&s;ing &s;uch a Circum&s;tance. The Nuptial Torch, the Bower, the Marriage Song, are all Particulars which we meet with in the Allu&s;ions of the ancient Writers; and in every one of them &s;omething is to be ob&s;erved, which denotes their Indu&s;try to aggrandize and adorn this Occa&s;ion above all others.</P>
<P>With us all Order and Decency in this Point is perverted, by the in&s;ipid Mirth of certain Ani|mals we u&s;ually call Wags. The&s;e are a Species of all Men the mo&s;t in&s;upportable. One can|not without &s;ome Reflection &s;ay, whether their flat Mirth provokes us more to Pity or to Scorn; but if one con&s;iders with how great Affectation they utter their frigid Conceits, Commi&s;eration imme|diately changes it &s;elf into Contempt.</P>
<P>A Wag is the la&s;t Order even of Pretenders to Wit and good Humour.

pleas'd with him&s;elf. The Wag's Gaiety con&s;i&s;ts in a certain profe&s;&s;ed ill Breeding, as if it were an Excu&s;e for committing a Fault, that a Man knows he does &s;o. Tho' all publick Places are full of Per&s;ons of this Order, yet, becau&s;e I will not allow Impertinence and Affectation to get the better of native Innocence and Simplicity of Man|ners, I have, in Spite of &s;uch little Di&s;turbers of publick Entertainments, per&s;waded my Brother <HI>Tranquillus</HI> and his Wife my Si&s;ter <HI>Jenny,</HI> in Fa|vour of Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> to be at the Play to Morrow Evening.</P>
<P>They, as they have &s;o much good Sen&s;e as to act naturally, without Regard to the Ob&s;ervation of others, will not, I hope, be di&s;compo&s;ed if any of the Fry of Wags &s;hould take upon them to make them&s;elves merry upon the Occa&s;ion of their coming, as they intend, in their Wedding Clothes. My Brother is a plain, worthy, and hone&s;t Man, and as it is natural for Men of that Turn to be mightily taken with &s;prightly and airy Women, my Si&s;ter has a Vivacity which may perhaps give Hopes to Impertinents, but will be e&s;teemed the Effect of Innocence among wife Men. They de&s;ign to &s;it with me in the Box, which the Hou&s;e have been &s;o complai&s;ant to offer me whenever I think fit to come thither in my publick Character.</P>
<P>I do not in the lea&s;t doubt, but the true Figure of Conjugal Affection will appear in their Looks and Ge&s;tures. My Si&s;ter does not affect to be gor|geous in her Dre&s;s, and thinks the Happine&s;s of a Wife is more vi&s;ible in a chearful Look than a gay Apparel. It is a hard Task to &s;peak of Per|&s;ons &s;o nearly related to one with Decency, but I may &s;ay, all who &s;hall be at the Play will allow him to have the Mien of a worthy <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gen|tleman; her, that of a notable and de&s;erving Wife.</P>

<P>There is no Calamity in Life that falls heavier upon humane Nature than a Di&s;appointment in Love, e&s;pecially when it happens between Two Per&s;ons who&s;e Hearts are mutually engaged to each other. It is this Di&s;tre&s;s which has given Occa&s;ion to &s;ome of the fine&s;t Tragedies that were ever written, and daily fills the World with Me|lancholy, Di&s;content, Phren&s;y, Sickne&s;s, De&s;pair, and Death. I have often admired at the Barba|rity of Parents, who &s;o frequently interpo&s;e their Authority in this grand Article of Life. I would fain ask <HI>Silvia</HI>'s Father, Whether he thinks he can be&s;tow a greater Favour on his Daughter, than to put her in a Way to live happily? Whe|ther a Man of <HI>Philander</HI>'s Character, with 500<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> is not more likely to contribute to that End, than many a young Fellow whom he may have in his Thoughts with &s;o many Thou|&s;ands? Whether he can make Amends to his Daughter by any Increa&s;e of Riches, for the Lo&s;s

of that Happine&s;s &s;he propo&s;es to her &s;elf in her <HI>Philander?</HI> Or whether a Father &s;hould com|pound with his Daughter to be mi&s;erable, though &s;he were to get 20000 <HI>l.</HI> by the Bargain: I &s;up|po&s;e he would have her reflect with E&s;teem on his Memory after his Death: And does he think this a proper Method to make her do &s;o, when, as of|ten as &s;he thinks on the Lo&s;s of her <HI>Philander,</HI> &s;he mu&s;t at the &s;ame Time remember him as the cruel Cau&s;e of it? Any tran&s;ientill Humour is &s;oon forgotten; but the Reflection of &s;uch a Cruelty mu&s;t continue to rai&s;e Re&s;entments as long as Life it &s;elf; and by this one Piece of Barbarity, an indulgent Father lo&s;es the Merit of all his pa&s;t Kindne&s;&s;es. It is not impo&s;&s;ible but &s;he may de|ceive her &s;elf in the Happine&s;s which &s;he propo|&s;es from <HI>Philander;</HI> but as in &s;uch a Ca&s;e &s;he can have no one to blame but her &s;elf, &s;he will bear the Di&s;appointment with greater Patience; but if &s;he never makes the Experiment, however happy &s;he may be with another, &s;he will &s;till think &s;he might have been happier with <HI>Philan|der.</HI> There is a kind of Sympathy in Souls that fits them for each other; and we may be a&s;&s;ured, when we &s;ee Two Per&s;onsengaged in the Warmths of a mutual Affectation, that there are certain Qua|lities in both their Minds which bear a Re&s;em|blance to one another. A generous and con&s;tant Pa&s;&s;ion in an agreeable Lover, where there is not too great a Di&s;parity in other Circum&s;tances, is the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing that can befal the Per&s;on be|loved; and if overlooked in one, may perhaps never be found in another. I &s;hall conclude this with a celebrated In&s;tance of a Father's Indul|gence in this Particular, which, though carried to an Extravagance, has &s;omething in it &s;o tender and amiable, as may ju&s;tly reproach the Hardne&s;s of Temper that is to be met with in many a <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Father.</P>

<P>AS it has been the Endeavour of the&s;e our Labours to extirpate from among the polite or bu&s;y Part of Mankind, all &s;uch as are either prejudicial or in&s;ignificant to Society; &s;o it ought to be no le&s;s our Study to &s;upply the Havock we have made by an exact Care of the growing Ge|neration. But when we begin to inculcate pro|per Precepts to the Children of this I&s;land, except we could take them out of their Nur&s;es Arms, we &s;ee an Amendment is almo&s;t impracticable; for we find the whole Species of our Youth and grown Men is incorrigibly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with Va|nity, Pride, or Ambition, according to the re|&s;pective Pur&s;uits to which they turn them&s;elves: By which Means the World is infatuated with the Love of Appearance in&s;tead of Things. Thus the vain Man takes Prai&s;e for Honour, the proud Man Ceremony for Re&s;pect, the ambitious Man Power for Glory. The&s;e three Characters are in|deed of very near Re&s;emblance, but differently received by Mankind. Vanity makes Men ridi|culous; Pride, odious; and Ambition, terrible. The Foundation of all which is, That they are grounded upon Fal&s;hood: For if Men, in&s;tead of &s;tudying to appear con&s;iderable, were in their own Hearts Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the Requi&s;ites for E&s;teem, the Acceptance they otherwi&s;e unfortunately aim at would be as in&s;eparable from them, as Appro|bation
<PB N="353" REF="360">
is from Truth it &s;elf. By this Means they would have &s;ome Rule to walk by; and they may ever be a&s;&s;ured, that a good Cau&s;e of Action will certainly receive a &s;uitable Effect. It may be an u&s;eful Hint in &s;uch Ca&s;es for a Man to ask of him&s;elf, Whether he really is what he has a Mind to be thought? If he is, he need not give him&s;elf much further Anxiety. What will the World &s;ay? is the common Que&s;tion in Matters of Dif|ficulty; as if the Terror lay wholly in the Sen&s;e which others, and not we our &s;elves, &s;hall have of our Actions. From this one Source ari&s;e all the Impo&s;tors in every Art and Profe&s;&s;ion, in all Pla|ces, among all Per&s;ons in Conver&s;ation, as well as in Bu&s;ine&s;s. Hence it is, that a vain Fellow takes twice as much Pains to be ridiculous, as would make him &s;incerely agreeable.</P>
<P>Can any one be better fa&s;hioned, better bred, or has any one more good Nature, than <HI>Dama&s;ip|pus?</HI> But the whole Scope of his Looks and Acti|ons tends &s;o immediately to gain the good Opi|nion of all he conver&s;es with, that he lo&s;es it for that only Rea&s;on. As it is the Nature of Vanity to impo&s;e fal&s;e Shews for Truths, &s;o does it al&s;o turn Real Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions into Imaginary Ones. <HI>Da|ma&s;ippus,</HI> by a&s;&s;uming to him&s;elf what he has not, robs him&s;elf of what he has.</P>
<P>There is nothing more nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h Reputation, than to &s;u&s;pend the Enjoyment of it. He that cannot bear the Sen&s;e of Merit with Si|lence, mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity de&s;troy it: For Fame being the general Mi&s;tre&s;s of Mankind, whoever gives it to him&s;elf, in&s;ults all to whom he relates any Circum&s;tances to his own Advantage. He is con&s;idered as an open Ravi&s;her of that Beauty, for whom all others pine in Silence. But &s;ome Minds are &s;o incapable of any Temperance in this Particular, that on every Second in their Di&s;|cour&s;e you may ob&s;erve an Earne&s;tne&s;s in their Eyes, which &s;hows they wait for your Approba|tion,
<PB N="354" REF="361">
and perhaps the next In&s;tant ca&s;t an Eye on a Gla&s;s to &s;ee how they like them&s;elves. Walk|ing the other Day in a neighbouring Inn of Court, I &s;aw a more happy and more graceful Orator than I ever before had heard, or read of. A Youth, of about Nineteen Years of Age, was in an <HI>In|dian</HI> Night-Gown and Laced-Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> pleading a Cau&s;e before a Gla&s;s: The young Fellow had a very good Air, and &s;eemed to hold his Brief in his Hand rather to help his Action, than that he wanted Notes for his further Information. When I fir&s;t began to ob&s;erve him, I feared he would &s;oon be alarmed; but he was &s;o zealous for his Client, and &s;o favourably received by the Court, that he went on with great Fluency to inform the Bench, That he humbly hoped they would not let the Merit of the Cau&s;e &s;uffer by the Youth and Inexperience of the Pleader; that in all Things he &s;ubmitted to their Candour; and mode&s;tly de&s;i|red they would not conclude, but that Strength of Argument and Force of Rea&s;on may be con|&s;i&s;tent with Grace of Action and Comeline&s;s of Per&s;on.</P>
<P>To me, who &s;ee People every Day in the mid&s;t of Crowds (whom&s;oever they &s;eem to addre&s;s to) talk only to them&s;elves and of them&s;elves, this Orator was not &s;o extravagant a Man as perhaps another would have thought him; but I took Part in his Succe&s;s, and was very glad to find he had in his Favour Judgment and Co&s;ts without any Manner of Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Effects of Pride and Vanity are of Con&s;e|quence only to the Proud and the Vain, and tend to no further Ill than what is Per&s;onal to them|&s;elves, in preventing their Progre&s;s in any Thing that is worthy and laudable, and creating Envy in&s;tead of Emulation of &s;uperior Virtue. The&s;e ill Qualities are to be found only in &s;uch as have &s;o little Minds, as to circum&s;cribe their Thoughts and De&s;igns within what properly relates to the
<PB N="355" REF="362">
Value which they think due to their dear and amiable &s;elves: But Ambition, which is the Third great Impediment to Honour and Virtue, is a Fault of &s;uch as think them&s;elves born for moving in an higher Orb, and prefer being Powerful and Mi&s;chievous to being Virtuous and Ob&s;cure. The Parent of this Mi&s;chief in Life, &s;o far as to regu|late it into Schemes, and make it po&s;&s;e&s;s a Man's whole Heart, without his believing him&s;elf a Dae|mon, was <HI>Machiavil.</HI> He fir&s;t taught, That a Man mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily appear weak to be hone&s;t. Hence it gains upon the Imagination, that a great is not &s;o de&s;picable as a little Villain; and Men are in|&s;en&s;ibly led to a Belief, that the Aggravation of Crimes is the Diminution of them. Hence the Impiety of thinking one Thing and &s;peaking ano|ther. In Pur&s;uance of this empty and un&s;atisfy|ing Dream, to betray, to undermine, to kill in them&s;elves all natural Sentiments of Love to Friends or Country, is the willing Practice of &s;uch as are thir&s;ty of Power, for any other Rea&s;on than that of being u&s;eful and acceptable to Mankind.</P>

<P>HAving lately turned my Thoughts upon the Con&s;ideration of the Behaviour of Parents to Children in the great Affair of Marriage, I took much Delight in turning over a Bundle of Let|ters which a Gentleman's Steward in the Country had &s;ent me &s;ome Time ago. This Parcel is a Collection of Letters written by the Children of the Family (to which he belongs) to their Fa|ther, and contain all the little Pa&s;&s;ages of their Lives, and the new Idea's they received as their Years advanced. There is in them an Account of their Diver&s;ions as well as their Exerci&s;es; and what I thought very remarkable, is, That Two Sons of the Family, who now make con&s;iderable Figures in the World, gave Omens of that Sort of Character which they now bear, in the fir&s;t Ru|diments of Thought which they &s;how in their
<PB N="366" REF="373">
Letters. Were one to point out a Method of Edu|cation, one could not, methinks, frame one more plea&s;ing or improving than this; where the Children get an Habit of communicating their Thoughts and Inclinations to their be&s;t Friend with &s;o much Freedom, that he can form Schemes for their future Life and Conduct from an Ob|&s;ervation of their Tempers, and by that Means be early enough in chu&s;ing their Way of Life, to make them forward in &s;ome Art or Science at an Age when others have not determined what Pro|fe&s;&s;ion to follow. As to the Per&s;ons concerned in this Packet I am &s;peaking of, they have given great Proofs of the Force of this Conduct of their Fa|ther in the Effect it has had upon their Lives and Manners. The elder, who is a Scholar, &s;howed from his Infancy a Propen&s;ity to polite Studies, and has made a &s;uitable Progre&s;s in Literature; but his Learning is &s;o well woven into his Mind, that from the Impre&s;&s;ions of it, he &s;eems rather to have contracted an Habit of Life, than Manner of Di&s;cour&s;e. To his Books he &s;eems to owe a good Oeconomy in his Affairs, and a Compla|cency in his Manners, though in others that Way of Education has commonly a quite different Ef|fect. The Epi&s;tles of the other Son are full of Accounts of what he thought mo&s;t remarkable in his Reading. He &s;ends his Father for News the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t noble Story he had read. I ob&s;erve, he is particularly touched with the Conduct of <HI>Codrus,</HI> who plotted his own Death, becau&s;e the Oracle had &s;aid, If he were not killed, the Enemy &s;hould prevail over his Country. Many other Incidents in his little Letters give Omens of a Soul capable of generous Undertakings; and what makes it the more particular, is, That this Gentleman had, in the pre&s;ent War, the Honour and Happine&s;s of doing an Action for which only it was worth coming into the World. Their Father is the mo&s;t intimate Friend they have, and they always con|&s;ult
<PB N="367" REF="374">
him rather than any other, when any Error has happened in their Conduct through Youth and Inadvertency. The Behaviour of this Gentle|man to his Sons, has made his Life pa&s;s away with the Plea&s;ures of a &s;econd Youth; for as the Vexations which Men receive from their Children ha&s;ten the Approach of Age, and double the Force of Years; &s;o the Comforts which they reap from them, are Balm to all other Sorrows, and di&s;ap|point the Injuries of Time. Parents of Children repeat their Lives in their Offspring, and their Concern for them is &s;o near, that they feel all their Sufferings and Enjoyments as much as if they re|garded their own proper Per&s;ons. But it is gene|rally &s;o far otherwi&s;e, that the common Race of 'Squires in this Kingdom u&s;e their Sons as Per|&s;ons that are waiting only for their Funerals, and Spies upon their Health and Happine&s;s; as in|deed they are by their own making them &s;uch. In Ca&s;es where a Man takes the Liberty after this Manner to reprehend others, it is commonly &s;aid, Let him look at Home. I am &s;orry to own it; but there is one Branch of the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Bicker|&s;taffs,</HI> who have been as erroneous in their Con|duct this Way as any other Family what&s;oever. The Head of this Branch is now in Town, and has brought up with him his Son and Daughter (who are all the Children he has) in order to be put &s;ome Way into the World, and &s;ee Fa&s;hions. They are both very ill-bred Cubs, and having li|ved together from their Infancy without Know|ledge of the Di&s;tinctions and Decencies that are proper to be paid to each other's Sex, they &s;quab|ble like two Brothers. The Father is one of tho&s;e who knows no better than that all Plea&s;ure is De|bauchery, and imagines, when he &s;ees a Man become his E&s;tate, that he will certainly &s;pend it. This Branch are a People who never had among them one Man eminent either for Good or Ill; however, have all along kept their Heads ju&s;t
<PB N="368" REF="375">
above Water, not by a prudent and regular Oeco|nomy, but by Expedients in the Matches they have made into their Hou&s;e. When one of the Family has, in the Pur&s;uit of Foxes, and in the Entertainment of Clowns, ran out the Third Part of the Value of his E&s;tate, &s;uch a Spendthri&s;t has dre&s;&s;ed up his elde&s;t Son, and married what they call a Good Fortune, who has &s;upported the Fa|ther as a Tyrant over them, during his Life, in the &s;ame Hou&s;e or Neighbourhood. The Son in Succe&s;&s;ion has ju&s;t taken the &s;ame Method to keep up his Dignity, till the Mortgages he has eat and drank him&s;elf into, have reduced him to the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;acrificing his Son al&s;o, in Imitation of his Progenitor. This had been for many Genera|tions the whole that had happened in the Family of <HI>Sam. Bicker&s;taff,</HI> till the Time of my pre&s;ent Cou&s;in <HI>Samuel,</HI> the Father of the young People we have ju&s;t now &s;poken of.</P>
<P><HI>Samuel Bicker&s;taff</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> is &s;o happy, as that by &s;everal Legacies from di&s;tant Relations, Deaths of Maiden Si&s;ters, and other In&s;tances of good Fortune, he has, be&s;ides his real E&s;tate, a great Sum of ready Money. His Son at the &s;ame Time knows he has a good Fortune, which the Father cannot alienate, though he &s;trives to make him believe he depends only on his Will for Main|tenance. <HI>Tom</HI> is now in his Nineteenth Year, Mrs. <HI>Mary</HI> in her Fifteenth. Cou&s;in <HI>Samuel,</HI> who under&s;tands no one Point of good Behaviour as it regards all the re&s;t of the World, is an exact Cri|tick in the Dre&s;s, the Motion, the Looks and Ge&s;tures of his Children. What adds to their Mi&s;ery, is, That he is exce&s;&s;ively fond of them, and the greate&s;t Part of their Time is &s;pent in the Pre&s;ence of this nice Ob&s;erver. Their Life is one continued Con&s;traint. The Girl never turns her Head, but &s;he is warned not to follow the proud Minxes of the Town. The Boy is not to turn Fop, or be quarrel&s;om; at the &s;ame Time not to

take an Affront. I had the good Fortune to dine with him to day, and heard his fatherly Table-Talk as we &s;at at Dinner, which, if my Memory does not fail me, for the Benefit of the World, I &s;hall &s;et down as he &s;poke it, which was much as follows, and may be of great U&s;e to tho&s;e Pa|rents who &s;eem to make it a Rule, That their Children's Turn to enjoy the World is not to com|mence, till they them&s;elves have left it.</P>
<Q>Now, <HI>Tom,</HI> I have bought you Chambers in the Inns of Court. I allow you to take a Walk once or twice a Day round the Garden. If you mind your Bu&s;ine&s;s, you need not &s;tudy to be as great a Lawyer as <HI>Cook</HI> upon <HI>Littleton.</HI> I have that that will keep you; but be &s;ure you keep an exact Account of your Linen. Write down what you give out to your Land|re&s;s, and what &s;he brings Home again. Go as little as po&s;&s;ible to t'other End of the Town; but if you do, come Home early. I believe I was as &s;harp as you for your Ears, and I had my Hat &s;natched off my Head coming Home late at a Stop by St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s Church, and I don't know from that Day to this who took it. I do not care if you learn to fence a lit|tle, for I would not have you be made a Fool of. Let me have an Account of every Thing every Po&s;t; I am willing to be at that Charge, and I think you need not &s;pare your Pains. As for you, Daughter <HI>Molly,</HI> don't mind one Word that is &s;aid to you in <HI>London,</HI> for it is only for your Money.</Q>
