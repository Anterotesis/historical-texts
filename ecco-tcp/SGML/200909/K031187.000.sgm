<L>WHERE <HI>Hermus'</HI> Waters wa&s;h the <HI>Lydian</HI> Strand,</L>
<L>The pow'rful <HI>Crae&s;us</HI> &s;tretch'd his wide Command,</L>
<L>A Warriour King, who&s;e willing Subjects bow'd</L>
<L>To &s;ceptred Worth, &s;uperior to the Croud.</L>
<L N="5">Va&s;t was his Wealth, for Conque&s;t &s;well'd his Store;</L>
<L>Nor what enrich'd the Prince, had left the People poor.</L>
<L>Two Sons he had, alike in outward Mien,</L>
<L>The tender Pledges of a dying Queen.</L>
<L>But &s;peechle&s;s one ne'er taught his Sire to melt</L>
<L N="10">With li&s;ping Eloquence by Parents felt;</L>
<L>And mimic Art in vain Expedients &s;ought,</L>
<L>To form the Tongue, and free th' impri&s;on'd Thought.</L>
<L>Yet blooming <HI>Atys</HI> well that Lo&s;s &s;upply'd,</L>
<L><HI>Atys</HI> the People's Hope, and Monarch's Pride.</L>
<L N="15">His beauteous Soul thro' every Feature glow'd,</L>
<L>And from his Lips &s;uch &s;oft Per&s;ua&s;ion flow'd,</L>
<L>As Nature had withheld the Brother's Share,</L>
<L>Only to pour a double Portion there.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3">But vain tho&s;e Graces, &s;ince conceal'd from View</L>
<L N="20">They droop in Shades, and wither where they grew.</L>
<L>For one dread Night, as o'er the weary King</L>
<L>The drow&s;y God had &s;tretch'd his leaden Wing,</L>
<L>He &s;eem'd, he knew not where, in Wars engag'd,</L>
<L>And, whil&s;t around the doubtful Battle rag'd,</L>
<L N="25">Saw from &s;ome ho&s;tile Hand unerring Part</L>

<L>Which Heav'n foretels, and Fate has &s;aid &s;hall come?</L>
<L N="35">"And yet perhaps the Gods the&s;e Dreams in&s;pire,</L>
<L>"To &s;ave the guiltle&s;s Son, and warn the Sire.</L>
<L>"Too fond of Arms I've wander'd far a&s;tray,</L>
<L>"While Youth and blind Ambition led the Way.</L>
<L>"And ravag'd Countries may perhaps demand</L>
<L N="40">"This bleeding Sacrifice for Wrongs &s;u&s;tain'd.</L>
<L>"Then hear me, Gods, propitious, while I &s;wear</L>
<L>"Peace, only Peace, &s;hall be my future Care.</L>
<L>"O wou'd your Powers but &s;ave my darling Boy,</L>
<L>"No more this Brea&s;t &s;hall glow, this Arm de&s;troy!</L>
<L N="45"><PB N="3" REF="4">"Nor e'er &s;hall <HI>Atys</HI> the dire Sport pur&s;ue,</L>

<L>"Untaught to feel th' in&s;atiate Lu&s;t of Prai&s;e.</L>
<L>He &s;pake, and cautious far away remov'd</L>
<L N="50">From <HI>Atys,</HI> what next <HI>Atys</HI> mo&s;t he lov'd,</L>
<L>The Pomp of War: No Falchions guard the Gate,</L>

<L N="65">Unhappy Sire! but vainly we oppo&s;e</L>
<L>Weak human Caution, when the Gods are Foes;</L>
<L>Thy Story's Sequel mu&s;t too &s;urely prove,</L>

<L>Nor yet &s;hall <HI>Atys</HI> thwart thy fond De&s;igns:</L>
<L N="70">He moves implicit as his Sire inclines.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5">On every Look his eager Duty hung,</L>
<L>And read his Wi&s;hes, e'er they reach'd his Tongue.</L>
<L>With Smiles he &s;trips his Helmet's plumy Pride,</L>
<L>With Smiles he lays his u&s;ele&s;s Spear a&s;ide;</L>
<L N="75">Nor lets one Sigh confe&s;s a latent Care,</L>
<L>Re&s;erving all his Griefs for his <HI>Adra&s;tus'</HI> Ear.</L>
<L><HI>Adra&s;tus</HI> early did his Soul approve,</L>

<L N="80">An exil'd Wand'rer from a cruel Home.</L>
<L>For, yet a Boy, his inadvertent Lance</L>
<L>An Infant Brother &s;lew, the Crime of Chance.</L>
<L>In vain he wept, no Expiation knew,</L>
<L>And loaded with a Father's Cur&s;e withdrew.</L>
<L N="85">But not in vain the Gods &s;uch Ills di&s;pence,</L>

<L>If hence we learn to feel another's Pain,</L>
<L>And from our own Misfortunes grow humane.</L>
<L>This young <HI>Adra&s;tus</HI> found, and hence confe&s;s'd</L>
<L N="90">That mild Benevolence, that warm'd his Brea&s;t.</L>
<L>Hence too his Fortune &s;tretch'd a bolder Wing,</L>
<L>And plac'd her Wand'rer near the <HI>Lydian</HI> King.</L>
<L>There long the favour'd Youth exalted &s;hone,</L>
<L>Dear to the Sire, but dearer to the Son.</L>
<L N="95">And pow'rful Sympathy their Hearts had join'd</L>
<L>In &s;tronger Ties, than Gratitude can bind.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6">With him did <HI>Atys</HI> every Sport pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>That Health demands, and earlier Ages knew.</L>
<L>At Morn, at Eve, at &s;ultry Noon, with him</L>
<L N="100">He rov'd the &s;unny Lawn, he &s;wam the Stream;</L>
