<DIV2 N="30" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<P>RAMBLE having never &s;een Bridget but once or twice acci|dentally at Lady Da&s;hit's, her face was not well-known to him; &s;he was &s;en|&s;ible of this, and being di&s;carded from her place as an accomplice with Tom, was driven to her &s;hifts. Knowing &s;he could not get another without a cha|racter, and that &s;he was not likely to
<PB N="4" REF="3">obtain, being rather a pretty young woman, and not more than twenty years of age; a &s;cheme came into her head, which, if &s;he could effect, &s;he thought might turn out as well if not better, than being a party concerned in marrying her mi&s;tre&s;s to Tom, Mr. Dangle's valet. This was, to dre&s;s her&s;elf up &s;mart, and make an appli|cation to Ramble for protection, under the pretence of being a young woman, the daughter of a ruined trade&s;man, turned out of doors, not having a place to fly to; and that po&s;&s;ibly Ramble, who was a man of gallantry and for|tune, and without attachment, might be taken with her appearance, and grant her that protection &s;he wanted,
<PB N="5" REF="4">which was to live with him as his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urdity of the &s;cheme mu&s;t be evident to every per&s;on of common &s;en&s;e. She might be di&s;covered, and if not at fir&s;t, mo&s;t likely would in the end, through Flint, the Colonel's &s;ervant. This thought &s;truck her, but tho&s;e who are &s;et upon a &s;cheme, &s;el|dom are deterred from it by little difficulties: &s;he &s;aid to her&s;elf, the Colonel is certainly not on &s;uch fami|liar terms with his &s;ervant, as to let him into the &s;ecret of his amours, and &s;hould he be tempted to catch at the bait, &s;he flattered her&s;elf &s;he was mi&s;|tre&s;s of tho&s;e charms, that, if the mat|ter
<PB N="6" REF="5"><HI>was</HI> afterwards di&s;covered, &s;he &s;hould be able to di&s;arm his anger, and keep him notwith&s;tanding. He can|not be &s;o ignorant, thought &s;he, as to expect <HI>that</HI> in a mi&s;tre&s;s, which he would look for in a wife. And where &s;uch an object is thrown in his way, many little circum&s;tances are over|looked, that would be thought un|&s;urmountable crimes, if that object was &s;tudied and &s;ought for.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, he who is acquainted with the world, mu&s;t know, that tho&s;e who lay &s;chemes to take in the unwary, &s;eldom plan the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o well as to put it out of the reach of detection. There is &s;omething unthought of and
<PB N="7" REF="6">unguarded again&s;t, that interferes and defeats it. Bridget mu&s;t have had but a poor in&s;ight into things, if &s;he could any way &s;uppo&s;e &s;he &s;hould have been able to have carried her point with Lady Da&s;hit; but, as &s;he <HI>did</HI> &s;uppo&s;e it, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the tran&s;|action in the light we have now view|ed it; that it was a de&s;perate attack, and as de&s;perately managed, and ended as tho&s;e &s;chemes generally do, in the overthrow and ruin of the &s;chemer.</P>
<P>Her de&s;ign on Colonel Ramble was not le&s;s ab&s;urd or impracticable. How|ever, &s;aid &s;he, nothing venture, no|thing have. She followed the Colo|nel's method of introducing him&s;elf
<PB N="8" REF="7">to Mi&s;s Trevor, by a note, and wrote him the following:</P>
<P><Q>An unfortunate young woman, under twenty, without a friend or a home, the daughter of a re&s;pectable trade&s;man thrown into pri&s;on for debt, wi&s;hes for an interview with Colonel Ramble. She tru&s;ts her ap|pearance will plead in her favour, and procure her that protection under his roof, which &s;he is ambitious to merit. The Colonel need only name the hour of his being alone, and &s;he will wait on him.&mdash;The bearer waits his an&s;wers.</Q></P>
<P>Ramble &s;ent for the bearer of the
<PB N="9" REF="8">letter up, and a&s;ked him &s;ome que&s;tions; but he being only a common porter, could give no other kind of informa|tion, than, that he was ordered to de|liver the letter and bring an an&s;wer. The Colonel wrote one in the following line: <Q>Colonel Ramble will be alone to-morrow morning at eleven.</Q></P>
<P>Ramble's general good opinion of mankind led him to put the be&s;t con|&s;tructions on this note, and, therefore, waited her coming with impatience, determining to relieve her, if relief was in his power. Bridget dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf up &s;martly and gayly, very much un|becoming the &s;uitor Ramble expected to meet with, but in that kind of wan|ton
<PB N="10" REF="9">attire, that be&s;poke her own wi&s;hes, and would leave, as &s;he thought, very little to explain. When &s;he fir&s;t entered the room, he received her with tenderne&s;s. She bur&s;t into affected tears, and thus addre&s;&s;ed him.&mdash; <Q>You &s;ee, Sir, before you, an innocent, help|le&s;s maid, deprived of her parents by the cruelty of creditors, her bed &s;old from under her, turned into the wide world without a friend to a&s;&s;i&s;t, induced from nece&s;&s;ity to &s;eek the protection of a &s;tranger. Your hu|manity is too well known, to make any feeble apologies of mine nece&s;|&s;ary. You are, I under&s;tand, a &s;ingle man, without attachment, and I am yet un&s;ullied and uncorrupted; and if
<PB N="11" REF="10">you can meet that &s;ociety in me, which gentlemen generally look for in women le&s;s innocent that my&s;elf, you will find me attentive, a&s;&s;duous, and dutiful.</Q></P>
<P>Such an addre&s;s Ramble little ex|pected; however, he de&s;ired her to be &s;eated, made &s;ome enquiries re&s;pecting her family and connexions; and finding when &s;he was off her guard, and inter|rogated on points &s;he was not prepared for, that &s;he he&s;itated, prevaricated, and was confu&s;ed; he began to call his recollection to his aid; looked her full in the face, examined her countenance, and thought he di&s;covered in her a re|&s;emblance of Bridget, Lady Da&s;hit's
<PB N="12" REF="11">woman.&mdash;He was not, however, certain of this, and, being very unwilling to tax her with it, if it &s;hould not be &s;o, and thus wound the feelings of one, apparently too much already wounded; began with a&s;king her, if &s;he did not know Lady Da&s;hit? Bridget's con|&s;cience immediately &s;truck her, and her countenance betrayed her guilt. Ramble now ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and &s;aid, <Q>I &s;ee but too plain, <HI>who</HI> you are, and <HI>what</HI> you are; you are, or were Lady Da&s;hit's woman; and I am &s;orry the detection in one iniqui|tous piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, has not de|terred you from attempting another. Your de&s;ign upon me I am at a lo&s;s to unravel, and happy it is for you, that
<PB N="13" REF="12">I have not got to the bottom of it. Be a&s;&s;ured, as humane as I am, I can &s;et my face again&s;t an impo&s;tor, and go great lengths to puni&s;h one. Many a per&s;on has been hanged for le&s;s offences than you have com|mitted, and, po&s;&s;ibly, it may be an ill-judged lenity to &s;uffer you to e&s;cape.</Q></P>
<P>Bridget, now a good deal frightened, bur&s;t into real tears; threw her&s;elf on her knees before him, wrung her hands, and implored his mercy. <Q>Mercy, (cried he, a&s;toni&s;hed) would, I fear, be ill-applied to one of your ca&s;t.&mdash; However, you are, as it were, &s;elf|convicted, and I hope, If I am &s;ilent
<PB N="14" REF="13">in this matter, my &s;ilence will not be abu&s;ed. Ri&s;e, and leave me, and let this lenity of mine be a caution to you, how you behave in future. You are young enough to reform, and for your own &s;ake I hope you will.</Q> Upon this he rung the bell, and Flint entered the room with his hand to his cap, &s;aluting. <Q>Flint, (&s;aid Ramble) I pre&s;ume you know this lady, take her under your e&s;cort, and conduct her down.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Fait, a I do, your honour, (returned Flint) and little Flint will take as much care of her as your honour would your own dear &s;elf.</Q> Flint then took her by the arm, put it under his, and the left the room together.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">Ramble's reflections on this bu&s;ine&s;s, were tho&s;e natural to every benevolent mind; that Bridget might not be de&s;|perately wicked, that &s;he might &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome good principles; but, that being a woman of intrigue, tho&s;e prin|ciples are often lo&s;t in the back ground; that an enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit often out|&s;trips our rea&s;on, leads us into wild acts, that, at a quiet moment we cannot but condemn; and, that whil&s;t &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition is endeavouring to improve its &s;ituation, it often mi&s;&s;es its mark, and undoes it&s;elf, like a man who too eager in &s;triking, often mi&s;&s;es his blow, lo&s;es his equilibrium, and otherthrows him&s;elf by his impetuou&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>RAMBLE now received a letter from Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, &s;aying, that they &s;hould leave London for Paris the next morning, but wi&s;hed him not to follow them for a day or two, le&s;t they &s;hould be detained at Dover, waiting for a fair wind; and, if it &s;o happened, they &s;hould there meet; &s;he &s;aid, the only per&s;on that was to go with them, was Brutus, the black. On receiving this intelligence, he prepared al&s;o for his journey; and the fourth day after he had received Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe's letter, with his valent and Flint, he took his way to Dover. On coming there,
<PB N="17" REF="16">he enquired what pa&s;&s;engers had lately pa&s;&s;ed for Calais, and found Ra&s;pe had &s;ailed two days before. All apprehen|&s;ions of falling in his way being over, he took the fir&s;t packet that &s;ailed, and, as Ra&s;pe travelled not very fa&s;t, was in Paris almo&s;t as &s;oon as him. His re|&s;olution at that time was not &s;o firmly &s;ettled at at pre&s;ent, and Paris was in commotion; but, as their &s;tay there would be but &s;hort, it was of no great moment.</P>
<P>Ra&s;pe, no &s;ooner arrived in Paris, than he placed his daughter in a con|vent; for, though his intent was to &s;tay there only a few days, he thought a convent the &s;afe&s;t place; this &s;he was
<PB N="18" REF="17">unacquainted with till &s;he arrived at Pa|ris, and of cour&s;e could not give Ram|ble intelligence of it; nor had &s;he an opportunity of &s;ending a line to the coffee-hou&s;e as propo&s;ed, as at the con|vent paper and pens were forbidden her.</P>
<P>To avoid in&s;ult, Ra&s;pe had put a Na|tional cockade into his hat as &s;oon as he &s;et his foot on French ground; and, on his arrival at Mr. Engli&s;h's; this gentleman took notice of the cockade, and &s;aid, <Q>I &s;ee you are already a vo|lunteer in our &s;ervice.</Q>&mdash;<Q>No vo|lunteer, (replied he) but nece&s;&s;ity has no law; my motive was to avoid danger. I dont' wi&s;h to be knocked
<PB N="19" REF="18">of the head.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Indeed, (replied Mr, Engli&s;h,) there is no medium in the people here;&mdash;they're either all one thing or all t'other. A few months &s;ince they were all &s;laves; now they are all free.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Wi&s;h to to be thought &s;o, (&s;aid Ra&s;pe) not &s;o in reality. From being &s;laves to others they are now &s;laves to them|&s;elves. Where's you daughter; en|quired Mr. Engli&s;h, I hope we &s;hall have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her. There's too much liberty, in this country for her (returned Ra&s;pe) We've a little of it in England, but that little was too much for her.&mdash; Liberty may do very well for our &s;ex&mdash;it ill agrees with her's.</Q>
<PB N="20" REF="19">"Where is Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe," (&s;aid Mr. Engli&s;h). <Q>That's a &s;ecret; (return|ed Ra&s;pe) I &s;carce know my&s;elf. I am afraid of lo&s;ing her in this wild country&mdash;the people are all wild here. I have placed her in a con|vent&mdash;liberty's a good thing, but abu&s;ed liberty, a bad one.</Q> Mr. Engli&s;h having been called out, re|turned, and &s;aid, <Q>he was &s;orry to be the me&s;&s;enger of ill news, but &s;everal of the mob without doors have been enquiring, whether he had not a per|&s;on in his hou&s;e, who had enriched him&s;elf at the expence of the free|dom and liberty of men: alluding, he pre&s;umed, to the traffic Mr. Ra&s;pe carried on.</Q>&mdash;Ra&s;pe, ex|pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="21" REF="20">&s;igns of fear, Mr. Engli&s;h went on. <Q>I would not have you be alarm|ed; only be cautious, and whil&s;t you continue at Paris, be &s;een as little abroad as po&s;&s;ible, or I would not an&s;wer for the con&s;equences.</Q> Ra&s;pe now more alarmed than ever, &s;aid, <Q>he dreaded the fury of a mob; yet could not be &s;hut up; he &s;aid his very fears would betray him, and wi&s;hed he had a di&s;gui&s;e.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Why, (replied Mr. Engli&s;h) as your per&s;on has been de&s;cribed, a di&s;gui&s;e would not be ami&s;s.</Q> If the floor had been burn|ing under him, Ra&s;pe could not be more re&s;tle&s;s. He could not &s;tay one in&s;tant in a place, but jumped about as if he had been on burning
<PB N="22" REF="21">coals. Mr. Engli&s;h told him he had put the populace off their &s;cent, by &s;aying, that he left Paris ye&s;terday; but &s;till recommended &s;ome kind of di&s;gui&s;e; &s;aid there was a <HI>Perukier</HI> in the next &s;treet, famous for making wigs that would give any character you like, make an old man of a young one, or a young man of an old one. Ra&s;pe, rejoiced at this, and determined to go to him immediately, and a&s;ked if the coa&s;t was clear; and being told it was, begged Mr. Engli&s;h would let his &s;er|vant &s;hew him the way. He accord|ingly put on his great coat, &s;lipped out of the back door, and &s;et off.</P>
<P>On Ramble's arrival, he put up at
<PB N="23" REF="22">at a hotel. He and his valet had ridden in a po&s;t-chai&s;e; Flint rode on hor&s;eback; and as they travelled very fa&s;t, and Flint was unu&s;ed to their paved roads, he found him&s;elf uncom|monly fatigued. <Q>I don't know how, (&s;aid he to his fellow-&s;ervant) the French roads may agree with an Engli&s;hman, but, arrah by my &s;houl, they &s;hake an Iri&s;hman all to &s;hivers. I havn't a &s;ound bone in my &s;kin, and the&s;e damn'd little galloways, are &s;o u&s;ed to &s;ay their prayers at every cro&s;s they pa&s;&s;ed, that it was as much as he could do to keep them on their legs.</Q>&mdash;<Q>You're an old &s;oldier, (&s;aid the valet), and &s;hould not mind a little difficulty. There's good
<PB N="24" REF="23">eating and drinking here, and this merry country will &s;oon bring you round again.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I have been taught from a child, (&s;aid Flint) to con&s;ider the French as an enemy; and as a &s;oldier, even learnt it with my exer|ci&s;e: but &s;uch is the heart of Flint, that as a change in their &s;entiments made England their friend, he now calls them brothers, and wants but and opportunity of doing them a bro|therly act.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Well, (&s;aid the valet) I mu&s;t go &s;ee for my ma&s;ter; do you take care of the baggage.</Q> Flint &s;et down upon it, and a girl pa&s;&s;ing the room, <Q>Come here, my &s;weet honey, (&s;aid Flint) and rub my back.</Q><Q>&mdash;What ails your back, (&s;aid the
<PB N="25" REF="24">girl.</Q> <Q>What ails my back, my dear?</Q> returned Flint. <Q>It has got the infection of your country;&mdash;fits and convul&s;ions.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Stiff, I &s;uppo&s;e, (&s;aid &s;he) with your journey?</Q> <Q>Fait and you may &s;ay that, (replied he,) very &s;tiff, indeed; and pulling her upon his knee, I wi&s;h you would rub it, and &s;upple it.</Q> <Q>Lord, fellow, (cried the girl,) let me alone, or I'll &s;lap your face.</Q> <Q>Any thing, my dear wench, (returned he,) to di|vert the pain from my back. Your cur&s;ed French pavements have al|mo&s;t &s;haken me to pieces. Shew me to your bed, I want to lie down.</Q> Struggling, however, &s;he got from "him, and left him to his reflections.</P>

<P>RASPE having found his way to the peruquier's, was &s;hewn into a room, where there was a variety of wigs, hanging on blocks, re&s;embling different characters. Bag, bods, ties, majors, and brigadiers. Ra&s;pe told the peruquier that he wanted to be di&s;|gui&s;ed, and a&s;ked him whether he could furni&s;h him with a wig that would totally change his appearance? <Q> Certainly, (&s;aid the peruquier) I have made it my &s;tudy for many years; have of late, converted abb&eacute;s, into generals, and generals into abb&eacute;s, and made gentlemen of &s;hopkeepers; turned co|quets
<PB N="27" REF="26">into prudes, and widows into virgins; nay, Sir, I have done more. I have out&s;tripped Time. To &s;erve a purpo&s;e, I have made boys to look like men in years, and old men of &s;e|venty to re&s;emble boys of twenty.</Q> <Q>Change of character (ob&s;erved Ra&s;pe) is no new thing here. A&s;hamed, I pre|&s;ume, to wear their own faces?</Q> <Q>Not a&s;hamed, &s;ir, replied the peruquier we, are a&s;hamed of nothing; Paris has long give law to fa&s;hion. Our modes change as often as the moon. We are now &s;hifting characters. An ari&s;tocrate takes that of a patriot; a fi&s;h woman that of a &s;oldier; a prie&s;t that of a &s;tate&s;man; and &s;o on. Our profe&s;&s;ion has hitherto been what you Engli&s;h|men
<PB N="28" REF="27">call a <HI>Tory:</HI> we bear the king's arms. In future we'll be <HI>Whigs,</HI> the application &s;uits a peruquier be&s;t. Once King&mdash;now country.</Q></P>
<P>Ra&s;pe de&s;ire he'd &s;hew hima variety; the peruquier now called a boy, and bade him bring the gentleman a hand|looking-gla&s;s and a &s;punge, and take down the <HI>Spani&s;h Admiral.</HI> <Q>You will be &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;ir, &s;aid he to Ra&s;pe, at the effect produced by a wig and a piece of charcoal.</Q> The boy gave the gla&s;s to Ra&s;pe, and the &s;punge to his ma&s;ter. Ra&s;pe looking about, &s;aid he hoped he &s;hould not be &s;een; and on being told all was private, a large black Ramilee was put upon him,
<PB N="29" REF="28">and the tail &s;uffered to hang over his &s;houlder; and with the charcoal the peruquier painted on his lip a pair of mu&s;tachios. Ra&s;pe looked in the gla&s;s and &s;eeing that he cut too fierce a figure, took off the wig and &s;aid it would not do, for he hated fighting. Spunge and water being given, the mu&s;tachios were taken off. "Mu&s;t be a prie&s;t then," (&s;aid the peruquier).&mdash;A <HI>bi&s;hop's</HI> full-bottomed grey was handed down, and put on Ra&s;pe as before, who on examining him&s;elf again, &s;aid <Q>That would not do, for he was apt to &s;wear.</Q> <Q>Bring then the <HI>Judge</HI></Q> (&s;aid the peruquier to the boy.)" This was tried, and Ra&s;pe &s;aid <Q>It was equally bad, he not being grave enough for
<PB N="30" REF="29">a judge.</Q> <Q>Reach down <HI>Independence</HI> then&mdash;</Q> (&s;aid the peruquier,) the wig was brought; this was a bag-wig, curls <HI>l'ailes de pigeon,</HI> and cocked up be|hind fanta&s;tically. The boy brought with him al&s;o a black puritanical head of hair. <Q>The&s;e are, (&s;aid the peruquier,) my &s;pecimen-wigs, if either of them plea&s;e, I can make you one in twelve hours.</Q>&mdash;Now &s;ir, (con|tinued he, taking the bag-wig) <Q>if any thing will &s;uit you, it will be this. I call it an independent bag. It is independence here that makes a man re&s;pectable. I don't mean independ|ence from money, but independence from determination; a re&s;olution to throw off all &s;ubordination and con|troul.
<PB N="31" REF="30">It is this which has made all our great men</Q> (naming mo&s;t of the leading men in the revolution.) <Q>By fortune and character, they were in|&s;ignificant, poor as rats, trifling as harlequin, but having flown from all authority, and our&s;tretched the law, they became great men; and this is the wig they wear.</Q> (Puts the wig on Ra&s;pe as before, who, frightened at his own figure, cries <Q>Lord! lord! this independence is the devil;</Q> and tore off the wig.&mdash;"Perhaps this, (&s;aid the peruquier, taking from the boy the black head of hair) <Q>Perhaps this will plea&s;e you better; the&s;e are the locks worn by tho&s;e who deplore the depravity of the times, execrate the
<PB N="32" REF="31">pre&s;ent licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the people, and wi&s;h to hide them&s;elves from the world.</Q> This being tried like the rest, gave equal di&s;atisfaction, Ra&s;pe &s;aid <Q>he liked none of them; loved his own &s;cratch be&s;t; would run every ri&s;k; would not venture on an a&s;&s;umed character, but would get out of Paris as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</Q> <Q>Well &s;ir, (&s;aid the peruquier), if none of my di&s;gui&s;e's plea&s;e you, and you wi&s;h to leave Paris, turn your coat. They are all turn-coats here&mdash;do this, and you may pa&s;s among the croud un|noticed.</Q></P>
<P>Ra&s;pe was &s;orry for having given him &s;o much trouble, and ob&s;erved, that

<P>RAMBLE going into an Engli&s;h coffee-hou&s;e at Paris, was not a little plea&s;ed with a kind of alternate dialogue that &s;truck his ear, in a man|ner very different from what was de|&s;inged by it, but conveying a very &s;ati|rical meaning. He had no friend with him, and not mixing with other par|ties then in conver&s;ation, had little to do, but to li&s;ten to what came from them, and &s;uch words as he heard at one ta|ble added to tho&s;e which came from
<PB N="34" REF="33">another, &s;o corre&s;ponded, as to form a dialogue of them&s;elves, &s;omething in the manner of the cro&s;s-reading of a new&s;paper, where the line of one co|lumn read on in the line of the adjoin|ing, frequently produces a &s;en&s;e dif|ferent from what the writer meant. It is difficult to explain this to the eye, but I will attempt in, that the reader, if po&s;&s;ible, may be as well entertained as he was. Conceive then three differ|ent tables in a public room, two Italians in conver&s;ation at one, two Engli&s;h|men reading the Engli&s;h new&s;papers at tanother, and two Dutchmen &s;moking at the third; and &s;uppo&s;e the following dialogue to take place between them, interrupted only occa&s;ionally by the
<PB N="35" REF="34">waiter, an&s;wering to their call and bringing them what they called for.</P>

This is my plai&s;ter for every &s;ore; it is &s;uch an emollient, that by an appli|cation to the brea&s;t, it &s;oftens the mo&s;t tyrannic heart, and by applying it to wounds of the head, it will re|cover a deranged one, and will heal even a love-&s;ick mind: it is al&s;o a

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>RAMBLE not finding a letter at the Engli&s;h Coffee-hou&s;e as he
<PB N="48" REF="47">expected, did not know what to make of it. He was well convinced of Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe's attachment to him, and her inclination to acquaint him with the &s;teps they took; of cour&s;e conceived &s;uch letter, if &s;ent, had mi&s;carried: or that &s;he was, &s;ome way or other, pre|vented from &s;ending one.</P>
<P>He enquired at the po&s;t-office, and at all the trading coffee-hou&s;es in the city, where there was a likelihood of his hearing of Mr. Ra&s;pe: had &s;ent to all the auberges, and hotels, and en|quired of every Valet de Place that he could hear of, but without effect.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was in this perplexity, running about from one room of his
<PB N="49" REF="48">hotel to another, he was acco&s;ted by an impertinent fellow, an Engli&s;hman, who lived at Paris upon his wits, and who intruded him&s;elf upon him with <Q>I ap|prehend, Sir, you are in &s;ome diffi|culty; I &s;hall be happy to re|lieve you.</Q> Being dre&s;&s;ed like a cox|comb, Ramble looked down on him with a degree of contempt, but recol|lecting that he might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ome knowledge of the arrivals, he replied, <Q>I am, 'tis true, Sir, a little embarra&s;&s;ed, and if I thought you could furni&s;h me with what I want, I would accept your kind offer.&mdash;I pre&s;ume, by your appearance, you are in a happy &s;tate of affluence and enjoyment, and po&s;|&s;e&s;s
<PB N="50" REF="49">that which many of our country|men &s;earch for far and wide.</Q> <Q>Damn it, I am in a hobble here,</Q> &s;aid Lackit a&s;ide, for that was the &s;tranger's name, who by the by, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;pirits, effron|tery, <HI>&s;ang froid,</HI> impudence,&mdash;every thing but money; then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Ramble&mdash; <Q>You mean, I pre|&s;ume, Happine&s;s.&mdash;Why, Sir, I am pretty well as to that; I have a good e&s;tate, but that's neither here nor there;&mdash;and I have a long pur&s;e,&mdash;but there's nothing in that, you know. It is not land or money that con&s;ti|tutes happine&s;s&mdash;I have it and I have it not&mdash;hah? Friend, you under&s;tand me?&mdash;I know every body here, and every body knows me;&mdash;and as I am
<PB N="51" REF="50">informed you are but ju&s;t arrived, I &s;hould be gland (<HI>&s;trutting about</HI>) to know &s;omething of <HI>you.</HI></Q> At this he turned upon his heel and ob&s;erved to him&s;elf, that what he &s;aid, was a good turn-off. Ramble told him, he neither wanted his pur&s;e nor his land; he want|ed merely a little information, and as, by his own account, he was acquainted with every one, po&s;&s;ibly he might be able to tell him of the late arrivals at Paris. He was in &s;earch of a party, whom he knew not where to find.&mdash;"Male or female?" retorts Lackit. "Both," returns Ramble. <Q>Egad, that's an hermaphrodite! Here are plenty of hermaphrodites in this coun|try, women with the martial &s;pirit
<PB N="52" REF="51">of men, and men with all the effemi|nacy of women. Times are however a good deal altered, <HI>petit-maitres</HI> have dropped their in&s;ignificance, and co|quets thrown off their airs, and both &s;exes &s;eem now to be animated with one enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;oul! You have no|thing to dread here, believe me, but from our own countrymen. If you value your quiet and your pur&s;e, don't mix with them. I &s;peak this <HI>entre nous,</HI> as a friend, I love my country, and I adore and Engli&s;hman, but I hate a &s;hark of any nation. Here are a number of the&s;e, who follow a &s;lave-&s;hip for blood, and run as to a fire, to enjoy the di&s;tre&s;s and con|fu&s;ion, and profit by any thing that
<PB N="53" REF="52">may fall in their way. Before you make any acquaintance, a&s;k <HI>me.</HI> I know but every one. If you are di&s;|po&s;ed for an intrigue, I can a&s;&s;i&s;t you, married or &s;ingle, demireps, reps, or no reps. I have a univer&s;al know|ledge of the women.</Q> <Q>You &s;ee'm to confound all &s;tates, Sir, (ob&s;erved Ramble) and make little or no di&s;tinc|tion. The married ladies &s;urely pay a little more regard to character, and don't &s;ubject them&s;elve's to the tongue of the calumniator.</Q> <Q>Sir</Q> (retorts Lackit, &s;taring in Ramble's face, with a vacant countenance) <Q>you &s;eem little ac|quainted with the world; married wo|men are &s;ooner to be had now then &s;ingle ones. The men have changed
<PB N="54" REF="53">their &s;y&s;tem, feel them&s;elves &s;afer in a connexion with married women, and conceive the enjoyment to be greater. Stolen plea&s;ures, they fay, are &s;weet, and cuckoldom now is become the ze&s;t of the gay world; the women court it, the men wink at it, and con|&s;ider it as a relief from a tire&s;ome drudgery. Many a family has pined for an her; barren &s;oils have been made prolific by new dre&s;&s;ing; the &s;tate is benefited by an increa&s;e of population; of cour&s;e the man of gallantry becomes a u&s;eful member of &s;ociety, and cuckoldom is growing into credit. It is particularly &s;o here, and I under&s;tand they are a getting into it in England.</Q> Ramble could
<PB N="55" REF="54">not but allow the character to be ju&s;t, tho' he held the remarker in contempt. It was a &s;ubject he did not reli&s;h, there|fore turned the converfation, by &s;aying, <Q>as you profe&s;s to know every one, po&s;|bly you may be able to inform me of a late arrival here.</Q> <Q>Certainly I can, (returned he) there is not an ar|rival of any note, but I am made ac|quainted with it, within an hour of their entering Paris.</Q> <Q>Have you heard then of &s;uch a per&s;on as Mr. Ra&s;pe, (&s;ays Ramble) and Engli&s;h mer|chant lately arrived here with his daughter?</Q> <Q>Is he in the &s;lave|trade?</Q> a&s;ks Lackit. "He is," re|plies Ramble. "<HI>Heard</HI> of him?" re|turns Lackit, <Q>yes, almo&s;t all Paris
<PB N="56" REF="55">has heard of him ere this.&mdash;Had it not been for <HI>me,</HI> he would have made his <HI>exit &agrave; la lanterne.</HI> Report &s;ays, he was at an Engli&s;h merchant's in this city, and it being &s;oon buzz'd about that he was an enemy to Liberty and the Rights of Man, the <HI>Sans Culottes</HI> &s;oon gathered round the hou&s;e, and would have torn him from it; but I being well with all ranks, pu&s;hed into the crowd and &s;aved him, ab&s;olutely by dint of lying.</Q> <Q>I don't think I could lie (&s;ays Ramble) to &s;ave any man.</Q> <Q>Oh, Sir, mi&s;|take me not, a gentleman never lies; he may amu&s;e to deceive, and deceive to amu&s;e; he may practi&s;e the <HI>ars di&s;&s;imulandi,</HI> but he never <HI>lies.</HI> With
<PB N="57" REF="56">all my faults, I am bold to &s;ay, I never told a direct lie but in a good cau&s;e; and it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim with me that a beneficial fal&s;ity is prefera|ble to a de&s;tructive truth. Be&s;ides, your friend is an Engli&s;hman, and En|gli&s;hmen will not be very punctilious where a countryman's life is to be &s;aved. Sir, as I have told you be|fore, I love my country and all that belongs to it; <HI>Vive la Nation!</HI> whether France or England. I got between the foremo&s;t of the mob and the door, &s;wore till I was black in the face, that he had left that hou&s;e the even|ing before; that I &s;aw him get into a po&s;t-chai&s;e and order the po&s;tillions to make the be&s;t of their way to the
<PB N="58" REF="57">fir&s;t &s;tage in the road to Lyons.</Q> <Q>And <HI>did</HI> you?</Q> &s;ays Ramble. <Q><HI>Did</HI> I? (retorts Lackit) No; certainly I did <HI>not.</HI>&mdash;It was all a humbug. The French are ea&s;ily humbugged.&mdash; Brun&s;wick has humbugged 'em, <HI>Mon|&s;ieur</HI> has done the &s;ame; Louis has humbugged them, and <HI>I</HI> have hum|bugged them.</Q> Then to&s;&s;ing him&s;elf about, roared out the burden of the old Engli&s;h &s;ong,</P>
<Q>"Sing tantarara humbug!"</Q>
<P><Q>I only told them &s;o (continued he), to pacify them; it an&s;wered the pur|po&s;e. I threw my pur&s;e among them, and away they went.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="58">Ramble's philanthropy was awakened at this recital. Tho&s;e who are free&s;t from guile, are mo&s;t ea&s;ily beguiled. He told Lackit that the gentleman who&s;e life he had &s;aved (for he believed him implictly) was a particular friend of his, and in who&s;e welfare, he was more than commonly intere&s;ted, and begged to know what were the contents of his pur&s;e. The very thought of get|ting &s;ome money from Ramble, rai&s;ed Lackit's &s;pirits and his art of addre&s;s; he cried <Q>Oh!&mdash;nothing, nothing,&mdash; Some 40 or 50 <HI>Louis d'ors;</HI> but that you know, my dear Sir, is nothing, a mere tri&s;le in competition with the life of a countryman. Had it con|tained
<PB N="60" REF="59">ten times the &s;um, they would have had it&mdash;they would indeed.&mdash; Money is no object to <HI>me,</HI> when I have it my power to do a good office. I could tell you of many &s;uch gifts&mdash; but what I give away, is nothing to any one.</Q></P>
<P>Ramble's generous heart was now rou&s;ed; he drew his pur&s;ed from his pocked, &s;aid, he believed it might con|tain &s;omething about the &s;um Lackit had given to the populace, and begged he might re-imbur&s;e him. Lackit eyed the pur&s;e with as much eagerne&s;s, as would a pickpocket watching an op|portunity to &s;teal it; but at the &s;ame time refu&s;ed to accept any return, with
<PB N="61" REF="60">a "Po&s;itively <HI>not,</HI>" and on Ramble's urging him to take it, &s;aying it was a &s;um Mr. Ra&s;pe, in fact, owed him, and would repay him with thanks, if he knew the circum&s;tance&mdash;therefore in&s;i&s;ting on it, that he might di&s;charge that debt for him. <Q>Sir, (&s;aid Lackit) if you knew my heart and my liberal &s;pirit, you would not offer me &s;uch and affront. Of what value is money, but for &s;uch purpo&s;es?</Q> <Q>I beg your pardon, (cries Ramble) I would not affront any man; much le&s;s one who has done my friend &s;o kind an office,</Q> and was in the act of returning the pur&s;e to his pocket. This Lackit did not mean he &s;hould do, and finding he had voer&s;hot his marks, told him, it would certainly
<PB N="62" REF="61">be an affront at any other time, than a time of commotion, when nothing was to be had without drawing one's pur&s;e|&s;trings; and as it might enable him to perform &s;ome &s;uch good office at an|other time, he would accept it; &s;aying however that he would take it on no other conditions, than that he would a&s;k his friend Ra&s;pe for it again, in who&s;e &s;ervice it was expended, and whom he was given to under&s;tand, was a wealthy man; and that he would al&s;o do him the honour to take part of a bottle of Burgundy with him. The&s;e conditions being a&s;&s;ented to, Lackit, who had not been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much ca&s;h for a great length of time, threw the pur&s;e up from his hand, and catching it, put it into his
<PB N="63" REF="62">pocket, with a <Q>May you be as well laid out as the la&s;t!</Q></P>
<P>Ramble a&s;ked Lackit to tell him where this Engli&s;h merchant lived, who had received Mr. Ra&s;pe. Lackit &s;aid he would conduct him there in the even|ing; at pre&s;ent he mu&s;t claim his pro|mi&s;e to drink a gla&s;s with him. He had a few Engli&s;h friends in the hou&s;e who would be happy to join them, and if he was di&s;po&s;ed to trifle away the morning with a little hazard, he would find the party a plea&s;ant one.</P>
<P>Lackit being now in ca&s;h, was in hopes to take Ramble in for another fifty at the hazard-table; but Ramble,
<PB N="64" REF="63">who&s;e thoughts were wholly on Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, begged to be excu&s;ed joining his party that day and took his leave, &s;ay|ing to him&s;elf, when alone, <Q>He has probably humbugged <HI>me;</HI></Q> yet con|&s;oled him&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that too often with the over-cautious has a fear of being over-reached or deceived, pre|vented their doing many a good and generous action.</P>

<P>RAMBLE &s;ent for Flint, and a&s;ked him if he knew any thing of Lackit that was in the hou&s;e. <Q>Does your honour maen (&s;aid Flint) a fellow in a tin&s;elled coat, who&s;e tongue runs like a jack-daw?</Q> <Q>I fancy we mean the &s;ame per&s;on (replied Ramble), he is an Engli&s;hman, and I am &s;orry to &s;ay that of a countryman, but it &s;trikes me, that he has robbed me of 50l.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Blood and tunder! (cries Flint, rai&s;ing his &s;tick) I'll find him out and give him a &s;ound bating.</Q> <Q>That (returns Ramble) will not re&s;tore me my money; be&s;ides, 'tis not here,
<PB N="66" REF="65">Flint, as it is in Ireland, where a man may drub a ra&s;cal unnoticed.</Q> <Q>Par|don me, your honour, (&s;ays Flint,) they take plea&s;ure here in drubbing any thing that wears the appearance of a jontleman. The poorer a man is in this country, I' my faith, the richer he is, at lea&s;t the more he is thought of, and the more power he has; the whole city is governed by men who have no breeches to their back&s;ides<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Sans Culottes.</NOTE> and who&s;e greate&s;t badge of di&s;tinction, is not having a coat to their back.&mdash;<HI>Do,</HI> your honour, let little Flint give this rogue a bit of a bating; it will cool his courage, and
<PB N="67" REF="66">do him a great deal of good.</Q> <Q>No, no, (returns Ramble) it is better, I believe to leave him to the &s;courge of his own reflection.</Q> <Q>Fait, and you may that too (replies Flint), the word of command is in his own brea&s;t; it is there given di&s;tinctly, and he mu&s;t be a bad &s;oldier who has been well drilled, that does not attend to it; his own court-martial will try him, and if found guilty, that &s;tout little drummer, Con&s;cience, will not &s;pare his la&s;hes, but lay them on heavy.</Q> <Q>Flint (returned Ramble) you are as good a philo&s;opher as a &s;oldier; but go, I would have you make &s;ome enquiries about him, find him out, tell him you belong
<PB N="68" REF="67">to me, and beg him to make you ac quainted with the place where Mr. Ra&s;pe fir&s;t lodged, when he came to Paris.</Q> He then told Flint the manner he had introduced him&s;elf and the &s;tory he had told of the mob; the narrow e&s;cape Ra&s;pe had, and his throw|ing his pur&s;e among the populace. Flint's anger was rou&s;ed; he told his ma&s;ter, that, if report &s;poke truth, he was one of tho&s;e who got his livelihood by &s;ucking the brains of others, and was &s;orry to find his honour had at all con|tributed to feed him. <Q>By St. Patrick! (roars he out) he's an arrant teef&mdash; The deel burn me&mdash;if he <HI>did</HI> trow his pur&s;e to the mob, but there was not a tirteener in it. By the great G-d,
<PB N="69" REF="68">(continued he) I'll ferret him out&mdash; If I find it a lie, and if I don't get the pur&s;e again, I'll make him repent of what he has done&mdash;he &s;hall remember little Flint as long as he lives.</Q> Say|ing this he &s;aluted, wheeled about, and left his ma&s;ter, brandi&s;hing his cudgel as he went out.</P>
<P>Ramble went to the Engli&s;h coffe-hou&s;e to make &s;ome enquiries into this affair him&s;elf, and learned part of Lackit's &s;tory to be ju&s;t, but that Ra&s;pe's e&s;cape was owing to him was as fal&s;e as the re&s;t was true. The lo&s;s of his money; did not much trouble him; could he have got the intelligence he wi&s;hed, he would have given twice the &s;um. He
<PB N="70" REF="69">ob&s;erved that though Lackit might not tell a direct lie, that fa&s;hionable <HI>ars di&s;&s;imulandi</HI> in which he was well ver&s;ed, went very near it. Entering the coffe-hou&s;e to return to his hotel, after it was dark, Chance, as in London, befriended him.</P>
<P>Rafpe's petulance of temper had brought him into a &s;quabble in the &s;treet. Brutus, the black, who always followed his ma&s;ter, hearing &s;ome Sa|voyards playing and &s;inging the follow|ing &s;ong in the next &s;treet, was running to li&s;ten to them.</P>

<P>Ra&s;pe, incen&s;ed at his fellow, called him back with anger, and &s;truck him on the head with his cane; the poor black roared out, and a gentleman who &s;tood at the door of a coffee-hou&s;e and &s;aw it, went up to him, and &s;aid <Q>You &s;eem, Sir, to forget where you are.&mdash; No man dare &s;trike his &s;ervant here&mdash;
<PB N="73" REF="72">a levelling principle has taken place among us, and for every blow a man gives, he &s;tands a chance of receiving three.</Q> <Q>Peace, fellow! (replies Ra&s;pe with warmth) or I'll level <HI>you.</HI></Q> The gentleman told him, that being an old man, was the only excu&s;e for his petulance. "Here are &s;ome ladies, con|tinued he; had they &s;een you, you would have repented of your ra&s;hne&s;s." The&s;e ladies were four fi&s;h-women, who though in petticoats were armed as mu&s;queteers, patrolling the &s;treets, and fifth beating a drum before them. <Q>Here (cried this gentleman, laughing,) are the National Guard.</Q> <Q>Cur&s;e the Na|tional Guard!</Q> replied Ra&s;pe angrily. The women hearing this, &s;eized him and
<PB N="74" REF="73">cried, Take him to the guard-hou&s;e. Ra&s;pe contending with them, bellowed out, <Q>Off, you harridans, or I'll be the death of you!</Q> and called Brutus to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. A mob was now collected, and the people laughed at the incident. The women having relea&s;ed him, Ra&s;pe a&s;ked them who they were; they an|&s;wered, The king's body guard. <Q>What pretence (continued he) have you to take <HI>me?</HI></Q> <Q>Pretence, hah! (cried one of the women) That's plea&s;ant tryly&mdash;we took the Ba&s;tille without pretence&mdash;we took the king without pretence&mdash;of cour&s;e, can want no pretence for taking <HI>you.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Ramble coming up at this time with
<PB N="75" REF="74">an acquaintance &s;aid, <Q>Sure I mu&s;t know that man!&mdash;It is he whom I have been &s;eeking; a&s;k him where he lodges.</Q> The gentleman did &s;o; but Ra&s;pe would not tell him; Ramble who was then in his uniform, &s;tepped forward, and &s;aid to the women, <Q>I mu&s;t take this gentleman's part; (then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Ra&s;pe) I am &s;orry to &s;ee you, Sir, in &s;uch an em|barra&s;&s;ment.</Q> Ra&s;pe, looking full in his face, &s;aid with &s;ternne&s;s <Q>I think I know <HI>you</HI>&mdash;it won't do&mdash;you have lo&s;t your aim. I have lodged her in a con|vent.</Q> Even this was a piece of happy intelligence to Ramble; he offered to get Ra&s;pe relea&s;ed, but he, Ra&s;pe, &s;aid, <Q>I won't be relea&s;ed by you&mdash;I'd rather
<PB N="76" REF="75">be in cu&s;tody a month.</Q> Ramble the addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the women, &s;aid it was only a little fracas, the effect of anger; that he was well acquainted with the gentleman, and continued. <Q>I am an Engli&s;h officer&mdash; you have done your duty, and may relea&s;e him.</Q> Ra&s;pe thinking a little money might in|duce them to do it, took out of his pocket a tobacco-box, in which was a little bit of dirty paper, folded up in two or three ca&s;e equally dirty, and unfold|ing them with great care, one after the other, till he came to the inner piece, &s;aid, <Q>here is &s;ome of your current coin, your a&s;&s;ignats&mdash;which an Engli&s;hman would'nt deign to &s;toop for.</Q> The women not liking the money, which
<PB N="77" REF="76">they &s;aid would not pa&s;s, cried, <Q>away with them!</Q> and attempted to drag them forward; re&s;i&s;tance being made, the drum was beat, and they called out "Guards! guards!" Two &s;oldiers within hearing, with bayonets fixed, ran to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the colonel finding the matter grew rather &s;erious, &s;aid to one of the &s;oldiers, <Q>Money has been of|fered to relea&s;e them; if you won't take money, take my word&mdash;I am a brother &s;oldier, and a gentleman, and will undertake they &s;hall appear at the guard-hou&s;e to-morrow morning.</Q> 
<Q>Soldier! (&s;aid the fellow) what of that?&mdash;You are not one of us, and though you may be a gentleman, I &s;han't believe you the &s;ooner&mdash;we
<PB N="78" REF="77">are all gentlemen here&mdash;we know no di&s;tinction.</Q> On which one of the &s;oldier laid hold of Ra&s;pe, and the women, of the black. Ra&s;pe, &s;truggling, a&s;ked their authority, and on being told, the National A&s;&s;embly, damn'd their National A&s;&s;embly. This was enough&mdash; it was <HI>leze-nation,</HI> high trea&s;on, in the eyes of the&s;e women, and they cried out, one and all, <HI>&agrave; la lanterne!</HI>&mdash;hang him&mdash; <HI>&agrave; la lanterne!</HI> The &s;oldiers and women then dragged them off, but the colonel a&s;&s;ured Ra&s;pe he would be at the guard|room as &s;oon as him. The mob &s;eemed to enjoy this piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, and Brutus, though a pri&s;oner, no le&s;s &s;o; for he was heard to &s;ay in going off,
<PB N="79" REF="78">hugging him&s;elf, <Q>Ma&s;&s;a no better as poor negro now!</Q></P>
<P>I cannot help making an ob&s;ervation here, on the hale con&s;titution of the French women. It is a fact, that a body of the fi&s;h-women, that is tho&s;e who &s;ell fi&s;h in Paris, and who are of a &s;tamp with our Billing&s;gate-ladies, did take up arms again&s;t their king; we know the lower cla&s;s of women al&s;o are employed in very laborious offices, &s;uch as carry|ing of loads, ploughing of the land, &amp;c. Though they are not apparently &s;tronger than the common women of other coun|tries, they undoubtedly are; and though they are effeminate in their per&s;ons, they are ma&s;culine in their ideas. This
<PB N="80" REF="79">remark, it is &s;aid, holds good only with the lower order of women; but we find the &s;ame &s;trength of con&s;titution in all orders. A lying-in woman of di&s;tinc|tion in France will be up the third day after delivery, and &s;leep with her hu&s;|band the ninth day, whereas an Engli&s;hwoman requires a month to recover her. What this ari&s;es from, I will not take upon me to &s;ay. It does not appear to be climate or mode of living; for if an Engli&s;hwoman lives twenty years in France, &s;he is never fit to go abroad after lying-in till nearly the expiration of a month; but a Frenchwoman, though a long time re&s;ident in England, is ge|nerally able to get about in nine days. It mu&s;t be owing to con&s;titution and to
<PB N="81" REF="80">&s;tamina. We find this al&s;o in their men. An apothecary of my acquaint|ance formerly a&s;&s;ured me (he told it as fact, and he is a man of too much vera|city to be doubted) that he had a patient in London, a Frenchman, at the ad|vanced age of 96, who was regularly three or four times a-year, injured in his health by a connexion with women of the town: That on being once &s;ent for to cure him of the &s;ame complaint, he found an old man with him, and, of cour&s;e, entered not into the &s;ubject till that per&s;on was gone. When alone, his patient ob&s;erved, he was glad nothing was &s;aid before that old gentleman, for it was his &s;on. On talking over the matter, the apothecary noticing a fine
<PB N="82" REF="81">healthy young woman waiting on him as a &s;ervant, &s;aid he wondered he was not more cautious, when he had &s;uffered &s;o much, and advi&s;ed him, &s;miling, to make his addre&s;&s;es to that healthy wench that attended him. <Q>Oh, (returns his patient, to&s;&s;ing his head) <HI>elle e&s;t mon pain quotidien.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It was certainly an awkward time for all parties to be at Paris during the com|motions that there took place; other|wi&s;e this change of things would have rendered it more agreeable. There was ever a kind of &s;ettled enmity between the French and Engli&s;h, which this re|volution has done away; but &s;till they cannot forget their ancient prejudices;
<PB N="83" REF="82">as a proof of it, the following laughable &s;tory is told. A French gentleman, lately in company with an Engli&s;hman, was boa&s;ting of the advantages ari&s;ing from the local &s;ituation of his country over England, by its having a variety of ports in <HI>Le Manche,</HI> meaning the Engli&s;h channel, which a Frenchmen will never call by that name, <Q>by which means, (&s;aid he) in time of war, we have an opportunity of watching and check|ing the motions of your fleet there. For example, <HI>Nous avons Bre&s;t, un port de mer, vis-&agrave;-vis Plymouth; nous aurions tant&ocirc;t Cherburg, au autre port de mer, vis-&agrave;-vis Port&s;mouth; et aurions au&s;&s;i Dunquerque, un port de mer, vis-&agrave;-vis la Thames.</HI></Q> <Q>Yes, Sir, (replied
<PB N="84" REF="83">the Engli&s;hman) and the more ports you have in our channel the better; for, when we want a man of war or two, we have not far to fetch them.</Q></P>

<P>RAMBLE went to his lodgings, put on his &s;word, and walked away to the guard-room, where he was intro|duced to the officer on guard. <Q>I waited on you (&s;aid Ramble) in be|half of a countryman of mine, who from an accidental di&s;pute in the &s;treet, has been brought here by the night-guard.</Q> <Q>I am glad (&s;aid the officer) to find it was only a di&s;pute.
<PB N="85" REF="84">It has been happily adju&s;ted; he and his &s;ervant are relea&s;ed, and are gone home.</Q> Ramble could not help ob|&s;erving, that a police was too &s;trict that enjoined the taking gentlemen into cu&s;tody for offences &s;o &s;light. <Q>The times (replied the officer) make it nece&s;&s;ary.</Q> <Q>This (returned Ram|ble) is one of the baneful effects of your revolution, an unbounded licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s of the people, followed up by as de&s;potic mea&s;ures as the revo|lution was de&s;igned to overthrow.</Q> The officer did not like this, and re|que&s;ted him to be a little more guarded in his expre&s;&s;ion. <Q>I am a French &s;oldier, (&s;aid he) and I &s;ee by your dre&s;s, you are an officer in the &s;er|vice
<PB N="86" REF="85">of the Engli&s;h.</Q> <Q>I am, (re|turned Ramble) and as we both &s;erve a free country, I &s;hould hope we are both of the &s;ame way of thinking&mdash;of cour&s;e it is a little out of character to call upon me to guard my tongue, when it is the privilege of a freeman to &s;peak his mind&mdash;I &s;ay again, your National A&s;&s;embly is far more tyran|nical than ever the monarch was.</Q> On the officer's &s;aying he did not &s;ee in what; Ramble went on, <Q>I could mention a thou&s;and in&s;tances. France was once a free country, and if time and wicked mea&s;ures had contrived to en&s;lave her, it would have been better to have reformed the old con|&s;titution than to have overthrown it,
<PB N="87" REF="86">and rai&s;ed a wor&s;e upon its ruins." Wor&s;e (retorts the officer) do you call it? Are we not now free?</Q> <Q>Far from it, (returns Ramble) you are greater &s;laves now than ever. Your clergy are &s;laves, your nobility are &s;laves, your king is a &s;lave, and your army, which &s;hould be the &s;upport of the con&s;titution, are the greater &s;laves of all.</Q> Ramble was not a man apt to give offence, he was rather the re|ver&s;e, but having always di&s;liked the French revolution, and being drawn into this &s;ubject rather unexpectedly, he could not but give way to his &s;pirit, and therefore &s;poke as he thought. The officer on guard, partaking rather of his national warmth, cried out with indig|nation,
<PB N="88" REF="87"><Q>This is not to be borne&mdash;army, &s;laves!&mdash;Con&s;ider, Sir, where you are, and who you are talking to.</Q> Ramble having now gone too far to retract, and his profe&s;&s;ion not &s;uffering him to eat his words, replied, <Q>I mean not to be per&s;onal, Sir, but I repeat, that your army are the greate&s;t &s;laves of the whole. There was a time when the French army was com|manded by gentlemen, men of family and fortune; your officers now are &s;hopkeepers, and manufacturers, men who from birth and education, can have no ideas of true honour; of cour&s;e the whole army is now dwin|dled into mercenary hirelings, who have betrayed their king, and broke
<PB N="89" REF="88">their oaths for a little extra-pay, and who are &s;laves to a wrong-headed &s;et of men, void of patrioti&s;m, who, whil&s;t they were tumbling their mo|narch from his throne, have &s;acrificed only their &s;hoe-buckles to their coun|try; an army that waits only the ra&s;h order of &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly to lay their country in blood.</Q> The French officer, who was one of the Paris militia and a trade&s;man, was now &s;tung to the quick. <Q>Having a command in that army, I mu&s;t (retorts he with anger) give the lie to that a&s;&s;ertion; and if you &s;ay one word more, I'll call the guard.</Q> Ramble taking him by the button of his coat, and with an eye that &s;poke the highe&s;t re&s;entment, replied,
<PB N="90" REF="89"><Q>Giving me the lie, Sir, is the &s;tronge&s;t proof of my a&s;&s;ertion. It is a proof of your low breeding ang the dunghill you &s;prung from.</Q> Saying this, he &s;hook him, as it were, from him. The officer called out "Guard!" but Ramble &s;top|ped his mouth, and cried <Q>Peace, rep|tile! &mdash;Call the guard at your peril. You wear the French uniform&mdash;if you have the &s;pirit of a &s;oldier, draw your &s;word in defence of your charac|ter. If you call the guard (continues he, drawing his own &s;word) I'll cut your throat.</Q> The officer drew his &s;word, and they exchanged a few thru&s;ts; but the Frenchman &s;oon declared, by his manner, that he was little acquainted with the u&s;e of it. Ramble &s;eeing this
<PB N="91" REF="90">&s;corned to take advantage of him, and cried out, <Q>Hold, Sir,&mdash;you had better put up your &s;word than lo&s;e your life&mdash;I &s;ee you are not ma&s;ter of it. What do you mean by that, coward?</Q> &s;aid the officer, in a great rage. <Q>Cow|ard! (retorts Ramble)&mdash; Advance then.</Q> Now they fought with &s;ome earne&s;tne&s;s, but Ramble &s;oon di&s;armed him, and the Frenchman finding him|&s;elf at Ramble's mercy, was &s;ilent; when Ramble &s;poke to him thus, and left him: <Q>The language you have held, would ju&s;tify me in delivering you over to the fi&s;hwomen.&mdash;How|ever, keep your council, be your own friend, and remember&mdash;you met with an Engli&s;h &s;oldier, who had more

He has often plea&s;ed him&s;elf with am|bitious reveries, and has often been di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed by the force of imagination. Some per&s;ons have called this vapour|ing a madne&s;s, others <HI>di&s;trait,</HI> but tho&s;e who &s;o rea&s;on, don't know him. He is at times a very plea&s;ant fellow; and as rational as any man in the world, but at others, is not to be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his
<PB N="95" REF="94">opinion. Having worked up his ideas to a certain pitch, he &s;ees things which no one el&s;e &s;ees, and realizes all the va|pours of his fancy. His reverie can only be &s;napped, like the fiddle-&s;tring over-wound; and I have known him, (&s;aid Ramble) break from his company with great abruptne&s;s, tell them he had bu&s;ine&s;s of the utmo&s;t importance&mdash;fly to the other end of the town, as if his well-being depended on being there to a quarter of an hour, and nothing could undeceive him, but tumbling over a lamplighter's ladder that &s;tood in his way. This, and this only, could convince him he had nothing to do. Not long &s;ince he courted a widow, in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;hewing her his country-hou&s;e, hired
<PB N="96" REF="95">a po&s;t-chai&s;e for the purpo&s;e, and when he had got forty miles from town, was &s;o taken up with his lady, that he had near|ly lo&s;t his way. It was with difficulty he could direct the driver up one lane down another; now to the right, then to the left. The hor&s;es nearly knocked up, and the lad's patience exhau&s;ted, he had almo&s;t lo&s;t him&s;elf. <Q>The de'el's in't, (cried he) if we don't &s;ee he hou&s;e pre&s;ently.</Q> And, on the lad's &s;aying to him&s;elf, with a degree of vexation, (though loud enough to be heard) <Q>I don't believe you have a hou&s;e to &s;ee;</Q> it brought him to him&s;elf, with a <Q>upon my con&s;cience, my lad, I believe you are right&mdash;turn about, and go back to the fir&s;t inn.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>ON Ramble's return to his hotel, Flint flew into his room, with the very pur&s;e he had given to Lackit. <Q>There it is, and plea&s;e your honour, (&s;aid Flint, throwing it down upon the table); but how much money it contains, I know not, not having taken the liberty to open it: 'tis pretty heavy and pretty full, and I hope your honour will find your&s;elf repaid with intere&s;t.</Q> Ramble a&s;toni&s;hed, exclaimed, "How is this!" <Q>Fait, and you &s;ay that too, (returns Flint) how is this! I tell your honour how it was. There is a room in this
<PB N="98" REF="97">hou&s;e, called the Gambling-room, where gentlemen and no gentlemen, but per&s;ons of all de&s;criptions are welcome to go in and lo&s;e their mo|ney. Having enquired this Mai&s;ter Lackit's character, and finding him only to be a &s;harper, I thought my|&s;elf a better man than him, and was determined to be one of the com|pany. There were many in the room &s;haking their elbows, and throwing out &s;ome little bits of bones out of a box, making a damned noi&s;e with their tongues; &s;o, your honour, d'ye &s;ee, &s;ome had their pur&s;es in their hands, &s;ome on the table, and that teef, that robbed your honour, trew his pur&s;e down on the table with as
<PB N="99" REF="98">much contempt, as if it contained only counters, and cried out, The be&s;t of tree trows for all it holds. I &s;natched up the pur&s;e, your honour, clapt it in my pocket, and told the jontleman, with this leave, that as he &s;eemed to &s;et no value on it, I would re&s;tore it to its right owner. It occa&s;ioned a great hubbub, and had I not &s;tood on my guard, in this manner, your honour, (brandi&s;hing his cudgel about) the enemy would have clo&s;ed in, and I &s;hould have been overpowered. I bawled out, however, &s;o as to be heard: Jontlemen, I am a &s;oldier, and not to be intimidated. The pur&s;e I have taken, belongs to my mai&s;ter, and was taken from him under fal&s;e
<PB N="100" REF="99">colours; and if I don't make this ap|pear to your &s;atisfaction, you may tear the cockade from my hat, and treat me as you plea&s;e. Upon this, your honour, I told them the &s;tory, and it turning out a lie that Mr. Ra&s;pe's e&s;cape was owing to Mai&s;ter Lackit, they were one and all again&s;t him, and I made the be&s;t of my way off with flying colours.</Q> Ramble &s;miled at the &s;tory, and ob&s;erved, that as he had won the prize, he might keep it, but recommended it to him to count the contents, and if Lackit had been lucky and added to the fifty guineas, to return him all that was over. This Flint promi&s;ed to do, &s;aying, <Q>Money ill got would never trive.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="100">Ramble now proceeded in &s;earch of Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe. He had enquired at all the nunneries in Paris except two, and the Ur&s;ulines was one of the&s;e. On knocking at the gate of the convent, the portre&s;s a&s;ked his will; he told her that he was in &s;earch of a young lady, who&s;e father had &s;aid, he had placed her at a convent; but not having mentioned which, he had enquired at mo&s;t of them. He &s;aid &s;he was but ju&s;t brought there and from London, and that her name was Ra&s;pe. The portre&s;s told him, there was no young lady of that name, but that there was one, that in &s;ome re|&s;pect an&s;wered to the de&s;cription, but her name was Simp&s;on. <Q>Plea&s;e to enquire (&s;aid Ramble) whether her
<PB N="102" REF="101">father is not from Liverpool; if &s;he &s;ays yes, tell her there is a gentleman at the gate that wi&s;hes to &s;peak with her.</Q> She went, made the enquiry, and returned; &s;aid the young lady was from Liverpool, and begged him to come in. He was now admitted into the parlour, and Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe &s;oon waited on him, attended by two &s;i&s;ters of the fraternity. He told the ladies he had a me&s;&s;age to this young lady from her relations in England, and a&s;ked if he might be indulged with leave to com|municate it in private. He was told, that if ten minutes would be &s;ufficient, he might command it. On this the nuns retired, and Ramble acquainted her with the trouble he had met with in
<PB N="103" REF="102">finding her out; that he believed he &s;hould never have done it, had not he met with her father accidentally, who told him with an angry triumph, that he put her out of his reach by lodging her in a convent. Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe replied, that nothing but her being there placed, un|known to her as &s;oon as &s;he arrived at Paris, and the &s;trict orders the ladies of that hou&s;e had received never to tru&s;t her with a pen and ink, prevented her from writing to him. She wi&s;hed he could contrive to get her from that place; but in ca&s;e he &s;hould not be able, he mu&s;t follow her to Florence which would be the end of their journey for &s;ome time. <Q>Can you (&s;aid he) any way get without the walls?</Q> <Q>Impo&s;|&s;ible,
<PB N="104" REF="103">(returned &s;he) my father has given a &s;trict charge that I &s;hould &s;ee no one nor be left alone. It was won|derful that you gained admittance, and more &s;o, that we are left together; but the ladies are too much u&s;ed to &s;uch interdictions to pay much re|gard to them.</Q> Ramble then a&s;ked, whether a good bribe to the portre&s;s, would not bring that woman into their mea&s;ures; &s;he was &s;ure, &s;he &s;aid, to the contrary. At this time, &s;he heard the noi&s;e of thunder. <Q>Ble&s;s me (&s;aid &s;he) how it thunders! You mu&s;t wait till the &s;torm is over. If it continues, I &s;hall be called to chapel; for they always go to prayers when it thunders much. Should I not be able to &s;ee
<PB N="105" REF="104">you again whil&s;t at Paris, where &s;hall I write to you? We &s;hall not be long here.</Q> <Q>At the Engli&s;h coffeehou&s;e. (replied the colonel.) I have found out your father's lodgings, and &s;hall have intelligence when you quit Paris.</Q> The &s;torm &s;eemed to gather, for great peals of thunder were heard, and the chapel-bell rung <Q>That's our &s;ummons (&s;aid Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe) to chapel. I &s;hall pre&s;ently be called.</Q> Ramble then gave her a letter, and &s;he gave him her hand to ki&s;s. The two nuns now returned to take her to chapel, and told Ramble there was a violent &s;torm, and hoped he would not venture out till it was over; &s;aid it was cu&s;tomary for them to attend prayers on &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions,
<PB N="106" REF="105">and hoped he would excu&s;e them. In&s;tead of abating, the &s;torm &s;eemed to increa&s;e, the thunder roll|ed and the lightning fla&s;hed, and hav|ing &s;truck one corner of the tower, part of it fell. This &s;o frightened the ladies, who imagined the whole build|ing was coming down, that the gates, were opened, and they all ran into the &s;treet, &s;creaming as for life. It was a lucky opportunity for Ramble and Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe. She flew to the parlour, where he was, and the gates being open, fled with him from the convent. Ramble took her to his lodgings, collected his baggage, and &s;et off with her that even|ing for Ver&s;ailles, and the next day &s;ent for a prie&s;t and was married to her.
<PB N="107" REF="106">The knot being now tied, their alarm in a great mea&s;ure cea&s;ed. He conti|nued at this place till he had equipped her with nece&s;&s;aries. He had &s;ent his valet and Flint on to Lyons, in their way to Italy, in order al&s;o to elude any &s;earch; nay, indeed, he &s;aid &s;he &s;hould not be di&s;appointed in &s;eeing that part of the world; for before he returned to England, he would take her to Naples, and &s;hew her every thing in their way that was worth &s;eeing.</P>
<P>The report in Paris that the tower of the Ur&s;ulines had been &s;truck with lightning, that the building had fallen, and that the nuns had taken refuge in the town, &s;oon reached Ra&s;pe: he flew to
<PB N="108" REF="107">the place with the anxiety of a parent, but was much more alarmed when his daughter could not be found: his fears fir&s;t led him to think &s;he mu&s;t have been buried in the ruins, but the por|tre&s;s a&s;&s;uring him, that &s;he &s;aw her afterwards in the parlour, a little quieted him. He roared and &s;tamped like a madman, and being told a gentleman with a cockade in his hat had been to pay her a vi&s;it that morning, and had not le&s;t the convent when the accident happened, he was convinced this was Ramble, and that he had in the general confu&s;ion carried her off. His bu&s;ine&s;s now was, if po&s;&s;ible, to find out where they were, and to trace them. This he knew not how to do. However his
<PB N="109" REF="108">friend Mr. Engli&s;h advi&s;ed him to &s;end to the city gates, and a&s;k the guard, what po&s;t-carriages had pa&s;&s;ed out of the city that evening. Intelligence was the next morning brought him, that a per&s;on, de&s;cribed to be Flint by his dre&s;s, was &s;ufficiently remarkable to be noticed, had gone the Lyons' road in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, with &s;ome other per&s;ons. This induced him to pur&s;ue that road; and being more confirmed at every po&s;t|hou&s;e they came to, he followed them quite to Lyons; where he overtook them, but was more unhappy at the di&s;|appointment in not meeting with his daughter, than perhaps he would have been, had he found her in the arms of her lover. He tried every means to
<PB N="110" REF="109">bring over Flint and his fellow-&s;ervant to his intere&s;t, but without effect. Large &s;ums of money were offered them, but they were not to be corrupted. He did not, however, lo&s;e &s;ight of them, but appointed a per&s;on to watch their motions, and follow them where-ever they went. Flint, will all his cunning, was not up to this, and it was by this means Ra&s;pe at la&s;t di&s;covered his daughter; for waiting at Lyons for or|ders from their ma&s;ter which way to proceed, their route was traced from city to city all through Italy, and Ra&s;pe with his &s;lave Brutus joined them where they met; but this was not till they reached Naples, Ramble and his lady having taken another route.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN they reached Naples, Ram|ble was a&s;toni&s;hed to hear from Flint, that Ra&s;pe was in that city. He almo&s;t doubted his veracity; but on Flint's a&s;&s;uring him, that he met and conver&s;ed with Brutus, he could not but believe it. Flint was among the multitude &s;tanding to hear one of tho&s;e &s;treet orators, who harangue the people in the &s;treets, in order to get money from them, &s;omething in the way of our mountebanks in England: In England they &s;ell medicines; in Naples, cruci|fixes.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="111">The following relation is from a gentleman who travelled in that part of the world, and who, a&s;&s;ured me, was pre&s;ent at the harangue. A large clu&s;ter of men, women, and children, were entertained to the highe&s;t degree, and made exceedingly happy, by a poor fellow that was ma&s;ked and played on the guitar; he a&s;&s;embled the crowd by his &s;ongs and his mu&s;ic, and by a thou&s;and merry &s;tories he told them, with infinite drollery. The old women &s;at li&s;tening with their di&s;taffs, &s;pinning coar&s;e flax, and wetting their thread with their &s;pittle; their grand-children &s;prawling at their feet, and amu&s;ed with the twi&s;ting of the &s;pindle. The men and their wives, they youth and their mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es
<PB N="113" REF="112">&s;at in a circle, with their eyes fixed on the mu&s;ician, who kept them laughing for a great part of the evening, with his &s;tories, which he enlivened oc|ca&s;ionally, with tunes on the guitar. At la&s;t, when the company were mo&s;t nu|merous and at the highe&s;t pitch of good humour, he &s;uddenly pulled off his ma&s;k, laid down his guitar, and open|ed a little box that &s;tood before him, and addre&s;&s;ed his audience thus: <Q>La|dies and gentlemen, there is a time for all things; we have had je&s;ting enough, innocent mirth is excellent for the body, but other things are re|qui&s;ite for the health of the &s;oul. I will now, with your permi&s;&s;ion, my honourable ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es,
<PB N="114" REF="113">entertain you with &s;omething &s;erious, of infinitely greater importance than fiddling and &s;inging; &s;omething for which all of you will have rea&s;on to ble&s;s me as long as you live.</Q> He &s;hook out of a bag a great number of leaden crucifixes. "I am ju&s;t come," continued he, <Q>my fellow citizens, from the holy hou&s;e of Loretto, on purpo&s;e to furni&s;h you with the&s;e jewels, more precious than all the gold of Peru, and all the pearls of the ocean. Now, my beloved bre|thren and &s;i&s;ters, you are afraid, I &s;ee, that I &s;hall demand a price for the&s;e &s;acred cro&s;&s;es, far above your abili|ties, and &s;omething corre&s;pondent with their value, by way of indem|nification
<PB N="115" REF="114">for the fatigue and expence of the long journey I have made, on your account, all the way from the habitation of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin, to this thrice renowned city of Naples, the riches and liberality of who&s;e in|habitants are celebrated all over the globe. No, my generous Neapoli|tans, I <HI>do</HI> not wi&s;h to take the ad|vantage of your pious and liberal di&s;|po&s;itions. I will not a&s;k for the&s;e invaluable crucifixes, (all of which, let me inform you, have touched the foot of the holy image of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin, which was formed by the hands of St. Luke, and moreover each of them has been taken in the <HI>&s;anti&s;&s;imo &s;codella,</HI> the &s;acred por|ringer,
<PB N="116" REF="115">in which the virgin made the pap for the infant Je&s;us). I will not, I &s;ay, demand an ounce of gold, nor a&s;k a crown of &s;ilver; my regard for you is &s;uch, that I &s;hall let you have them for a penny a piece.</Q> This mor&s;el of eloquence, no doubt, was a great pennyworth; and when we recol|lect the &s;ums &s;ome men are paid for their oratory in England, though it &s;el|dom produces &s;o pathetic a &s;pecimen, we mu&s;t conclude, then, eloquence is a much &s;carcer and dearer commodity in England than in Italy.</P>
<P>It was at &s;uch a &s;treet harangue, as I have ob&s;erved, that Flint met with Brutus. Ramble finding Ra&s;pe there|fore
<PB N="117" REF="116">at Naples, endeavoured to make the be&s;t of it, and &s;aid he would now take &s;ome pains to bring about a recon|ciliation. He wrote to Mr. Ra&s;pe, &s;aid as things had turned out, he was not unhappy at finding him at Naples, that he had loved his daughter from the moment he &s;aw her, that he loved her for her per&s;onal qualities, and not for any appendage of fortune, that might follow her; that &s;he was now his wife; that he was a gentleman both by birth and education, and not a beggar; that he was the object of his daughter's choice, waved any claim upon her &s;up|po&s;ed fortune; was convinced he could maintain her well upon his own; and would pledge him&s;elf to make her hap|py.
<PB N="118" REF="117">Mrs. Ramble wrote al&s;o to her father, &s;aid every thing in her power to obtain his pardon, exculpate her hu&s;|band for any unbecoming or unhand|&s;ome conduct, took the blame if there was any; upon her&s;elf; &s;aid no woman on earth could be happier than &s;he &s;hould, with her father's forgivene&s;s; and with his leave they would throw them|&s;elves at his feet. Ra&s;pe was of too irra&s;cible a di&s;po&s;ition to li&s;ten to any terms. Revenged he would be of the &s;educer; as he called it, of his child; and hearing there was a certain de&s;cription of men in mo&s;t Italian cities, who, for a premium, would lye wait for, and di&s;patch any one we wi&s;hed to be rid of, was determined to find out one of
<PB N="119" REF="118">the&s;e men, and try to effect it. He made his Black acquainted with this re&s;olution, who though according to a received opinion, that negroes have not that fellow-feeling which we naturally feel, &s;huddered at the idea. Ra&s;pe, however, worked him up to be faithful in this bu&s;ine&s;s, by fair promi&s;es and future rewards, and he according to his ma&s;ter's orders looked out for a man of this &s;tamp. Such men are in Italy not difficult to be met with, and Brutus having found one, introduced him to his ma&s;ter, and left them together. He was a man with a downca&s;t look, with murder written in his countenance.</P>
<P>"What is your name, friend?" &s;aid
<PB N="120" REF="119">Ra&s;pe. "I have no name," an&s;wered the fellow. <Q>What are you called then?</Q> returned Ra&s;pe. "Bravo," replied he. "And what is your pro|fe&s;&s;ion?" &s;ays Ra&s;pe. "A murderer," retorts he, and with a &s;ternne&s;s that made even the unfeeling old man trem|ble.</P>
<P>Ra&s;pe, however, collected him&s;elf, and &s;miling replied, <Q>A very honourable profe&s;&s;ion!</Q> <Q>You need not &s;neer; (&s;aid Bravo) as times go, it is a pro|fe&s;&s;ion equally <HI>honourable,</HI> with many truly called &s;o. There's your <HI>ac|coucheurs,</HI> I believe they are called in your country, men-midwives. How many murders do they commit, hired
<PB N="121" REF="120">for it as we are, de&s;troying infants in the birth; and yet (continued he with a &s;neer) accoucheurs are men of <HI>honourable</HI> profe&s;&s;ion! There are your medical practitioners, that learn experience at the expence of other men's lives.&mdash;What are they but murderers? And yet phy&s;ic (&s;neering) is an <HI>honourable</HI> profe&s;&s;ion! Then, again, there are your lawyers, the greate&s;t murderers of all.

So again, your &s;lave-trade merchants,
<PB N="122" REF="121">that deal in human fle&s;h....</Q> He was going on, but Ra&s;pe feeling the force of his rea&s;oning, cried, <Q>No more of your remarks.&mdash;Are you not afraid of detection?</Q> <Q>Not much for that, (replied the Bravo) every profe&s;&s;ion has its ri&s;ks, and we are well paid for ours. Tho&s;e who employ us are equally criminal, of cour&s;e are al|ways hu&s;h, le&s;t they &s;hould betray them&s;elves. Be&s;ides, our bu&s;ine&s;s is generally done in the dark, and a dead man tells no tales. The laws al&s;o of this country favour us; for if a man is under pro&s;ecution, there are &s;o many courts to go through, and &s;o many loop-holes in each part of the proce&s;s; that it mu&s;t be a very
<PB N="123" REF="122">extraordinary ca&s;e indeed, if we can|not &s;lip through &s;ome of them.&mdash;But what is your bu&s;ine&s;s with me?</Q> Ra&s;pe a&s;ked him in confidence, whether he might rely on him. Bravo looking &s;ternly and &s;tedfa&s;tly in his face, and &s;lapping his brea&s;t, cried, <HI>"Honour!"</HI> "I want a man's throat cut," &s;aid Ra&s;pe. "I'll do it," returns the fel|low &s;martly, &s;lapping his brea&s;t again. His price was a&s;ked, and being told 50 pi&s;toles, half in hand, Ra&s;pe gave him the money. "You have a black," &s;aid the fellow. <Q>I have (returned Ra&s;pe) What then?</Q> <Q>The&s;e are men (re|plied he) of no con&s;cience. You mu&s;t order him to &s;hew me the man, and a&s;&s;i&s;t me.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="123">Ra&s;pe told him he would, and bid him be with him again an hour hence; but before he left him, &s;aid, he hoped he &s;hould not be deceived; that what he undertook would be effectually done; and that no qualms of con&s;cience or human feelings would prevent it. <Q>None, (&s;aid the fellow, warmly). If we had either one or the other, we could not live by our profe&s;&s;ion. I'll give you an in&s;tance (continued he); a gentleman hired me the other day to cut a man's throat&mdash;I did it&mdash;and had 50 pi&s;toles. His father offered me the next day one hundred, to cut my employer's throat, and generou&s;ly paid me before hand. I did it."&mdash;Did it! (&s;ays Ra&s;pe) as how?"&mdash;
<PB N="125" REF="124">When I returned to my fir&s;t employer (replied he) to receive my money, he was &s;o plea&s;ed with my expedition, that he gave me twenty more. I thanked him&mdash;he was going to leave me,&mdash;but I &s;topped him&mdash;told him, I had received a hundred for cutting his throat&mdash;he &s;tarted&mdash;&s;aid he would give me the like &s;um for hone&s;tly acquainting him with it, and was going to give me the money; but I told him, as I ever acted upon ho|nour, and had received my reward, I mu&s;t perform the deed; &s;o without further ceremony, I whipped out my knife, &s;eized him by the throat, as I may do you, (&s;eizing Ra&s;pe by the collar) and was through his heart in

<P>RAMBLE was invited by Prince Caraccioli to a mu&s;ical piece he had got up for the entertainment of his friends at his own private theatre; and it was found out that Ramble and his lady meant to be pre&s;ent. This was the
<PB N="127" REF="126">evening in which it was &s;ettled that the horrid deed was to be done. Ra&s;pe had brought over Brutus to his purpo&s;e, and the plan was accordingly laid. Brutus and Bravo met for this purpo&s;e, &s;ome days prior to the time fixed. Bravo a&s;ked him, if he had received his ma&s;|ter's orders to a&s;&s;i&s;t him? Brutus &s;aid, he was to &s;hew him the colonel, as he went to the opera. "Aye," (replied the Bravo, taking the black by the hand and looking &s;ternly in his face) <Q>and murder him!</Q> <Q>Me no murder colonel, (&s;aid Brutus), colonel is good man.</Q> <Q>And is not your ma&s;ter a bad one (a&s;ked the fellow) to think of &s;uch a thing?</Q> <Q>Ma&s;&s;a bad man indeed!</Q> replied Brutus. <Q>You
<PB N="128" REF="127">cannot love your ma&s;ter?</Q> &s;aid the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. <Q>Me no lo&s;e Ma&s;&s;a, (returned the other) Ma&s;&s;a beat poor negro&mdash; u&s;e poor negro ill.</Q> <Q>Is there any harm in killing a man (a&s;ks the Bravo) who wi&s;hes to kill another?</Q> Brutus replied, <Q>Colonel no killee Ma&s;&s;a&mdash; Ma&s;&s;a killee colonel.</Q> <Q>Now &s;up|po&s;e (continued the Bravo) in&s;tead of killing the colonel, for which your ma&s;ter would give me fifty pieces, &s;uppo&s;e we were to kill your ma&s;ter? He de&s;erves death for meditating the death of another.</Q> It was not the principle of retaliation that induced this fellow to this determination, but the &s;ight of a great box of money in Ra&s;pe's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, when he was with him.
<PB N="129" REF="128"><Q>Though Ma&s;&s;a be bad man and beat poor negro, (&s;aid Brutus, trembling) Me no kille Ma&s;&s;a&mdash;poor negro no bad man.</Q> <Q>Did you &s;ee (&s;aid the fellow) what a quantity of money he has?</Q> Brutus hugged him&s;elf at this thought, and an&s;wered "Yeas." <Q>Let me into his room at night (&s;aid the Bravo) I'll kill him&mdash;you &s;han't be concerned in it, and yet you &s;hall have half that great bag of money. What I do with money?</Q> a&s;ked Brutus. <Q>Carry you to your own country,</Q> &s;aid the Bravo. This won over the black at once. The idea of going back to his own country over&s;et him. He agreed to the mea&s;ure, and it was &s;ettled, that on that very evening
<PB N="130" REF="129">at twelve o'clock at night, when he was to way-lay the colonel on his return from the theatre, that Brutus &s;hould admit him to his ma&s;ter's chamber, when he was a&s;leep; for Ra&s;pe always went to bed early, &s;carce was up later than ten o'clock. <Q>All the difference (&s;aid the Bravo) well be, that he will fall by the dagger that he would plunge into the brea&s;t of his &s;on-in-law.</Q> Brutus pro|mi&s;ed to admit him, but &s;aid <Q>Mind, I no hand in it.</Q> <Q>Not the lea&s;t (returned the Bravo). It will only be the old one outwitted.</Q> Brutus was plea&s;ed with this, and replied <Q>Then Ma&s;&s;a be outwitted indeed!&mdash;No beat poor negro again.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="130">This dreadful piece of bu&s;ine&s;s would certainly have taken place, but Provi|dence interpo&s;ed to prevent it. Pre|de&s;tination is a doctrine exploded by &s;en&s;ible men; but too many in&s;tances occur in the&s;e volumes, not to &s;hew that what <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be, <HI>will</HI> be. The timely di&s;covery of the plan laid for lady Da&s;hit; the colonel's meeting with Ra&s;pe at the attorney's; his meeting him again al&s;o at Paris; the e&s;cape of Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe from the convent of the Ur&s;u|lines; the overthrow of the &s;cheme laid for the colonel's life, and that al&s;o medi|tating the death of Ra&s;pe: One would be led to think that the&s;e events were &s;tudied, and not the effects of chance. Chance, did I &s;ay? What is chance but
<PB N="132" REF="131">an interpo&s;ition of Providence, tending to a purpo&s;e &s;hort-&s;ighted man is unac|quainted with? What is luck in a lot|tery or at gaming? He mu&s;t be an ob&s;tinate rea&s;oner, that will not allow it mu&s;t be more than mere accident, that &s;hall beggar one man and enrich another. If this be attributed to luck, and luck be no other than good fortune, brought about by chance, the &s;ame may be &s;aid of all the fortuitous events of life. Philo&s;ophers, however, will allow the interpo&s;ition of Providence in <HI>great</HI> events, denying it only in <HI>&s;mall</HI> ones; but the&s;e mu&s;t be the philo&s;ophers of a Pagan age; they cannot be Chri&s;tians, when the Deity has declared, that not a &s;parrow falls to the ground without

<P>Flint met Brutus a day or two after his conference with Bravo. The people had flocked into the &s;treet after dark, to &s;ee the effect of an irruption of Ve&s;u|vius, then pouring forth its liquid tor|rents of fire. Brutus and Flint were among the re&s;t, and the negro's mind, di&s;turbed with the project he had en|gaged in, was almo&s;t panic &s;truck at the blazing of the mountain, which put him in mind of the puni&s;hment awaiting upon wickedne&s;s. <Q>Hah! honey (&s;aid Flint to Brutus, in meeting with him) look at that fire, and tremble.</Q> Brutus in fact <HI>did</HI> tremble, and that not
<PB N="134" REF="133">a little, and told Flint that he was &s;orry he had left Paris "Why?" &s;aid Flint. <Q>Noting, (replied Brutus, &s;ighing,) Oh poor Ma&s;&s;a!</Q> and on &s;aying this, he looked about him as one deranged in mind. "Is your mai&s;ter dead?" &s;aid Flint. <Q>Not dead yet, (cried Brutus) going to be dead, (and here he &s;hed tears) Ma&s;&s;a would killee me. Me no killee Ma&s;&s;a.</Q> <Q>Kill your Mai&s;ter, (returned Flint) certainly not.&mdash;I hope you have no &s;uch thoughts&mdash;if you have, a &s;ure as you do it, the devils will chuck you into that fire.</Q> Brutus &s;till trembling, cried, <Q>Me no killee Ma&s;&s;a,&mdash;Bravo come and killee him.</Q> Flint appre|hending &s;omething in the&s;e words of
<PB N="135" REF="134">the poor black, and finding him in &s;uch a &s;ituation as to be led almo&s;t to any thing; told him he would take him to the colonel, and the colonel &s;hould be his friend. <Q>No go to the colonel, (cried he) colonel hang me.</Q> <Q>Phu, non&s;en&s;e!</Q> &s;aid Flint, and took him with him.</P>
<P>Flint having brought him to his ma&s;|ter, Brutus opened to him the horrid &s;cheme, and Ramble thought he could not do a better thing than get the black to admit him privately into his ma&s;ter's room, and &s;eize the villain at the mo|ment he was going to perpetrate the deed; thinking by this he &s;hould not only apprehend the murderer, and bring
<PB N="136" REF="135">him to ju&s;tice, but that the fear of de|tection, and the gratitude he mu&s;t feel for this act of the colonel in &s;aving his life, would be the be&s;t means that could be devi&s;ed to bring Ra&s;pe round; for all the conce&s;&s;ions he could make, or any arguments he could u&s;e would not effect it. He, therefore, determined not to go to the opera that evening, but propo&s;ed to Brutus, that if he would admit him into his ma&s;ter's chamber a little before twelve, he would there wait till the Bravo came, and they lay hold of him, and a&s;&s;ured the black that if he did the bu&s;ine&s;s properly, he would not only reward him, but purcha&s;e his freedom.</P>

<P>RAMBLE was now as happy as his heart could wi&s;h. He had reached the &s;ummit of his ambition, that of ob|taining the woman he loved, and had little doubt, but a reconciliation with her father would take place, and every other difference be made up. <Q>We are now married (&s;aid he to his wife) and he cannot take you from me, and my bu&s;ine&s;s now &s;hall be to find &s;ome method of bringing about a recon|ciliation.</Q> The &s;tory he had heard from Brutus, did not alarm him; he had contrived to turn it to his advantage. They had received a very polite invita|tion
<PB N="138" REF="137">from Prince Caraccioli to continue &s;ome weeks with him, and this was the more extraordinary as the fa&s;hionable world at Naples, though they keep &s;plen|did equipages, and a large hall of &s;er|vants, are by no means ho&s;pitable. They vi&s;it, keep up a great deal of eti|quette, but a man may as well break his neck as his fa&s;t, in one of their hou&s;es. Their &s;ervants are generally married men, are paid by the week, and live at home with their own families, attending their ma&s;ter only at certain hours of the day; and at night when the family go to re&s;t, out of an e&s;tabli&s;hment of twen|ty &s;ervants there &s;hall not be one man that &s;leeps in the hou&s;e, and the ma&s;ter after a certain hour &s;hall have to wait
<PB N="139" REF="138">upon him&s;elf. An ingenious friend of mine, relates the following &s;tory of a lady at Paris, where the cu&s;tom of vi&s;it|ing is much the &s;ame as at Naples; and will give the reader an in&s;ight into the nature of fa&s;hionable intercour&s;e. We are apeing the manners of the French, and are very near them in all their points of etiquette, and a very little time will give us the following &s;cene in London.</P>
<P>A young widow of quality and great fortune, who&s;e hou&s;e was the rendez|vous of all the <HI>beaux e&s;prits</HI> of Paris, was at her toilet one day in high con|&s;ultation with a general officer and two priggi&s;h abb&eacute;s, concerning a head-dre&s;s
<PB N="140" REF="139">&s;he had invented, and meant to e&s;tabli&s;h as a fa&s;hion. She was one of tho&s;e ladies who felt her own con&s;equence, talked loud, &s;aid a great deal, and &s;poke upon all occa&s;ions very deci&s;ively. The&s;e gentlemen having pa&s;&s;ed many encomiums on her &s;martne&s;s, ta&s;te, and elegance, &s;he was in the highe&s;t &s;pirits, and &s;wung round from her gla&s;s, exult|ing with <HI>"Allons mes enfans, &agrave; la gloire."</HI> At this moment her &s;ervant entered, and informed her that Madame la Com|te&s;&s;e had accepted her invitation to din|ner, and would do her&s;elf the honour of waiting on her. This unexpected intelligence almo&s;t petrified her. Her &s;pirits &s;unk, and &s;he was &s;carce able to &s;peak. Had notice been brought her
<PB N="141" REF="140">of the death of her father, or an only child, &s;he could not have been more damped, and with the accents of de&s;pair and &s;taring eyes, drawled out <Q>E&s;t&mdash;il <HI>po-&s;i-ble,</HI> qu'on pui&s;&s;e &egrave;-tre &s;i b&ecirc;te!</Q> She examined the &s;ervant particularly, <Q>Are you &s;ure &s;he &s;aid that &s;he'd <HI>come?</HI></Q> <Q>Very &s;ure, madam,</Q> replied the fel|low. Fre&s;h exclamations followed. "Did you invite her for this day?" &s;aid the general. <Q>Undoubtedly I did, (re|turned the lady) that mark of polite|ne&s;s could be no longer delayed; and what then? She is connected with &s;ome of my relations in the we&s;t, has been in town a week, and I could do no le&s;s; but I could not &s;uppo&s;e &s;he was vulgar enough to accept the in|vitation.
<PB N="142" REF="141">She has, I find; and the horrid woman, with a rudene&s;s and ignorance of life without example, &s;ends me word &s;he'll <HI>come.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>That &s;he &s;hould have mi&s;under&s;tood your lady&s;hip's kindne&s;s &s;o prodigi|ou&s;ly (&s;aid one of the abbe's) is &s;hock|ing.</Q> <Q>Shocking, (returned the lady) it is a <HI>barbarous</HI> return of civility, and will teach me to be more upon my guard in future. As &s;oon as I heard &s;he was in town, I left my name at her door, &s;he returned my vi&s;it the next day, and having charged my Swi&s;s never to let her in, I have not &s;een her. <HI>Cela e&s;t tout &s;imple</HI> you know <HI>&amp; &s;elon les regles,</HI> for the wo|man
<PB N="143" REF="142">is old enough to be my mother, and, of cour&s;e, we mu&s;t be intoler|able to each other. Had &s;he had any ideas of good breeding, &s;he mu&s;t have &s;een that my invitation was merely a matter of polite ceremony, and, of cour&s;e, &s;hould as politely have refu&s;ed it, as when we pre&s;s a friend to take a di&s;h of chocolate, we never expect it to be accepted. Had we thus under&s;tood each other, we might have vi&s;ited for years, dined and &s;upped together, and been on the mo&s;t agreeable footing imaginable; but this in&s;tance of <HI>gro&s;s&icirc;&egrave;ret&eacute;,</HI> mu&s;t put an end to all future connexion. &mdash;Well&mdash;there is no remedy.

<P><PB N="144" REF="143">Now the reader mu&s;t be told that the counte&s;s accepted the invitation to dinner, not out of re&s;pect, or any de|&s;ire to dine with that lady, but <HI>par pure malice,</HI> and purpo&s;ely to plague <HI>her</HI> whom &s;he hated. However, &s;he made &s;hift to &s;hew &s;eeming good &s;pirits and good humour, by a continued grin the whole time &s;he was with her, and all the next day complained that her face ached with the di&s;tortion.

<HEAD>CHAP. XLII.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole country of Naples is a &s;cene of hypocri&s;y, accompanied with &s;uper&s;tition. It infects all orders of men, not only the upper cla&s;s, but the lower; the gentry, the army, and the church. The military of Naples are as full of &s;uper&s;tition as the monks are of hypocri&s;y.&mdash;The following laughable &s;tory happened whil&s;t Ramble was at Naples, and Flint was a party in it. A capuchin friar, a man of infamous character, who had formerly been one of the banditti in Silicy, and who, tired of a life of danger, fled from that i&s;land, took the cowl, and became a
<PB N="146" REF="145">monk of St. Francis, of one of the con|vents in Naples; and to make &s;ome at|tonement for his pa&s;t life, with the hopes of getting again into credit, he put on the ma&s;k of hypocri&s;y, &s;ubmitted to &s;e|verer penance than the re&s;t of his fra|ternity, wore a larger cordon, and put on the &s;anctified countenance of a &s;aint. But he was an old &s;inner, and his fle&s;h had not left off warring again&s;t the &s;pirit. He therefore was on the look out for a wench in a &s;nug corner, where he might carry on his amours unno|ticed by the brotherhood. There are not wanting females of that de&s;cription in every capital, much le&s;s in the capi|tal of Naples; he &s;oon fixed his eye on a lady, who lodged on a ground floor in
<PB N="147" REF="146">an ob&s;cure part of the city, paid his ad|dre&s;&s;es to her, and was admitted as an occa&s;ional lover. The monks of St. Francis carry no money; but as the females of ea&s;y virtue in Naples, are not without their &s;uper&s;tition; by ad|mitting this monk, &s;he hoped to do away her offences, and by parcelling out her favours to this man among others, &s;he was in hopes, by partaking of his &s;anctity, &s;he &s;hould le&s;&s;en her &s;ins. This lady told him, that &s;he was in keeping by a corporal of the life-guards, which was a Spani&s;h regiment, that he was a very jealous pa&s;&s;ionate man; but that if he was not afraid of the re&s;entment of one of &s;ix feet two inches high, with a &s;pada of uncommon length, and who,
<PB N="148" REF="147">when angered, was as furious as a tyger, &s;he &s;hould be glad to receive him now and then in her keeper's ab&s;ence; that he frequently attended the king, after the opera, to Portici, and when he was out on duty, &s;he would let him know.</P>
<P>The monk, with all the impatience of a pa&s;&s;ionate lover, waited her &s;ummons. At la&s;t it came, and he hied to her lodgings. Matters were &s;oon adju&s;ted, and the parties were in bed. It &s;o hap|pened that the life-guard-man de&s;erted from duty that night, and unexpectedly returned home; finding the door locked, he knocked hard, he thundered. <Q>Lord! (&s;aid &s;he to the monk), Vengioza is returned; he knocks at the door;
<PB N="149" REF="148">&s;hould he find us together, he will certainly be the death of us both.</Q> The capuchin, more alarmed for an apprehended lo&s;s of &s;anctity, than fear of death or drubbing, jumped out of bed, gathered up his cloaths, and crept under it. It was &s;o near the ground, that it was with difficulty he could &s;queeze beneath it. He was no &s;ooner concealed, than madam ro&s;e and let her <HI>cara &s;po&s;a</HI> in; he made a great noi&s;e at being kept at the door &s;o long, and bid her &s;trike a light. Now the monk's heart fainted within him. At every &s;troke of the flint, his &s;pirits &s;unk; but the artful minx, in &s;earching for the tinder-box, which was under the bed, threw &s;ome of the water from the cham|ber-pot
<PB N="150" REF="149">into it. The tinder would not kindle. She &s;aid it was wet. The monk's &s;pirits revived, and &s;he de&s;ired her lover to go and light the candle at the lamp in the next &s;treet. There are no public lamps in the &s;treets of Naples, but this was a lamp burning under an image of the virgin. No&mdash;he would rather go to bed in the dark. Down went the capuchin's &s;pirits again. He kept a brandy bottle al&s;o under the bed, and trying to reach it, very nearly caught hold of the monk's head. The lady, however, relieved the capuchin from this fright, by reaching it her&s;elf. She and Vengioza were now within the &s;heets, and the weight of the two &s;o pre&s;&s;ed down the &s;acking, as almo&s;t to
<PB N="151" REF="150">&s;tifle the prie&s;t below, who began to con&s;ider how he &s;hould e&s;cape. Fir&s;t he thought of &s;queezing from his confine|ment, &s;eizing the &s;pada, which his rival had laid with his cloaths on the chair, and demanding capitulation for him&s;elf and the lady. No; that might lead to a di&s;covery. Whil&s;t he was con&s;ider|ing how to act, his rival &s;nored; all his fears, of cour&s;e, vani&s;hed. With &s;ome difficulty he edged him&s;elf by little and little from under the bed, dre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf in the &s;oldier's cloaths, le&s;t he &s;hould be di&s;covered in the &s;treets &s;o late in the night, and left his own garments on the chair in the room of tho&s;e he took. He &s;allied thus boldly out, and madam was not unhappy he was gone.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="151">When without the hou&s;e, he began to con&s;ider how he &s;hould repay his rival for the fright he had put him into; at la&s;t the thought &s;truck him, that he would go to the guard-room and tell the officer on guard, that if he was di&s;po&s;ed to have &s;ome mirth at the expence of a capuchin, he could now give him an op|portunity. The capuchins being gene|rally very &s;evere on the conduct of the military men at Naples, the officer was happy in the idea of a retaliation. The monk was not di&s;covered in his new dre&s;s, as the &s;oldier who&s;e cloaths he had on, wore a wig, and that wig cover|ed the monk's bare head. It happened that Flint, who had been &s;hut out of his lodgings, had taken him&s;elf to the guard|room
<PB N="153" REF="152">with the officers permi&s;&s;ion, to wait the return of day, and as Flint was a &s;oldier, he was readily admitted. The monk a&s;&s;ured the officer, that he had traced a capuchin friar into the hou&s;e of a woman of ill fame, that he li&s;tened at the window, and knew they were in bed together; and that if he would go with him, he would conduct him to the place. Flint &s;eemed to enjoy the idea; they took a lantern, and the officer, Flint, the monk, and two or three of the guard, ha&s;ted to the place of ren|dezvous. Flint ob&s;erved, how happy he &s;hould be, if they could pop in upon them whil&s;t the monk was upon his kness, &s;aying his prayers. Having reached the hou&s;e, they thundered at the door,
<PB N="154" REF="153">and demanded admittance in the king's name. The &s;oldier within, apprehen|&s;ive it might be the guard come to &s;eize him for running from his duty, &s;oon occupied the place the capuchin had left, but not before he had &s;crambled up his cloaths, as he thought, which he took under the bed with him. Thus &s;ecure, the lady opened the door, and was told by the officer, that he demand|ed the body of a capuchin friar, that was in her room. Knowing the monk had e&s;caped &s;ome time before, &s;he a&s;|&s;ured him, no capuchin was there. "Look under the bed," &s;aid the monk, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be there concealed. He accordingly took the lantern, and di&s;covering him. <Q>You may always
<PB N="155" REF="154">find a fox, (&s;aid he) by his &s;mell. Fah&mdash;how he &s;tinks, one may &s;cent him a mile off.</Q> <Q>By my &s;houl and you may &s;ay that too, (&s;ays Flint). He &s;mells &s;tronger than a pole-cat. Give me the lantern&mdash;I'll &s;oon ferret him from his ambu&s;cade.</Q> The monk now began to pull out the cowl, and the tunic <Q><HI>Ecce &s;ignum,</HI> (&s;aid he) fir&s;t the rags, then the friar.</Q> <Q>You'll have &s;ome trouble (&s;aid Flint) to di&s;lodge him; let us lay a train and blow the enemy up, battery and all.</Q> The monk having pulled out the cloaths and the cordon, next drew out the &s;inner. The lady in all this bu&s;tle was raving round the room, <Q><HI>Ah mio Dio, Siamo
<PB N="156" REF="155">perduti, Siamo perduti</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Siamo perduto</HI> means&mdash;Oh my G-d! I am ruined, I am ruined.</NOTE>.</Q> <Q><HI>Charmed</HI> as you have been, (cried Flint) you mu&s;t find &s;ome other prie&s;t to per|form<HI>duty</HI> now.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;oldier, who conceived this to have been a judgment on him, for vi&s;it|ing his girl on a day of ab&s;tinence, and not bowing to the crucifix in his way to Portici, &s;tood trembling and mute before them. At la&s;t he broke &s;ilence, with a&s;&s;uring them he was no capuchin. The officer ob&s;erved, that he merited ca&s;tigation for denying his order, and Flint took up the cordon, which as I have noticed, was a heavy one, and
<PB N="157" REF="156">&s;wearing by St. Patrick, &s;aid he would give him a dozen for belying his colours. Vengioza, in &s;tupid amazement, took it all patiently, was dre&s;&s;ed by them in the capuchin's garments, his hands tied behind him, and thus conducted to the guard-room, prote&s;ting all the way that he was no capuchin, and receiving &s;tripes as he went, as the officer &s;aid by the order of St. Francis, Flint called it running the gauntlet.</P>
<P>The monk dreading a di&s;covery at the guard-room, excu&s;ed him&s;elf to the officer, &s;aid he was &s;orry that he could not accompany them, as he had to mount guard early, and recommended it to him to take good care of the prie&s;t.&mdash;
<PB N="158" REF="157">Having left the company, he &s;tole into his own convent, and having a &s;econd &s;uit of mona&s;tic cloaths, put them on, and carried the &s;uit of regimentals he wore and laid them down at the gate of a capuchin convent far di&s;tant from his own, with a view that when the matter came out, it might not be traced to him.</P>
<P>The life-guard-man, when brought to the guard-room, was known by &s;ome of his comrades, underwent their ridicule, and for ab&s;enting him&s;elf from duty without leave, was &s;entenced by a court-martial to be flogged. This &s;o exa&s;pe|rated the whole Spani&s;h regiment to which he belonged, that they determined
<PB N="159" REF="158">to be revenged of the capuchin; and it being &s;hortly after di&s;covered who the author of this deep-concerted plan was, a riot en&s;ued, &s;everal of the fra|ternity were &s;tiletto'd, and had not the inqui&s;ition taken it up, brought the monk to trial, and ordered him flagel|lation in the public &s;treets, an in&s;urrec|tion might have been the con&s;equence.

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE Prince, as I have ob&s;erved, propo&s;ing to entertain his friends with a mu&s;ical piece, at his private theatre, ordered Squallini his chapel-ma&s;ter to put one up, that is, prepare &s;ome piece for the purpo&s;e. It was at a time when there were no female per|formers at Naples; but that his highne&s;s might not be di&s;appointed, he applied to three gentlemen, who&s;e wives &s;ung very well, and reque&s;ted of them to let their ladies perform the women's parts, which would be but &s;hort; and as no one would be admitted but the prince's particular friends, and his highne&s;s
<PB N="161" REF="160">would con&s;ider it as a favour done to him, he hoped they would have no ob|jection. They did not chu&s;e to give him an immediate an&s;wer, but propo&s;ed giving him the meeting, and talking the matter further over; &s;aying, that if they liked the piece, they &s;hould have no objection, and having a&s;ked their wives, they con&s;ented upon the &s;ame terms. The names of the&s;e gentlemen were, Bavelli, Torriano, and Napioni. On being met for the purpo&s;e, Bavelli a&s;ked Squallini the &s;ubject-matter of his piece. <Q>What &s;ignifies the &s;ubject? (&s;aid he) your eyes and ears will &s;oon tell you, when the piece is performed.</Q> Na|pioni in&s;i&s;ted on knowing, for he had given his con&s;ent conditionally, and it
<PB N="162" REF="161">was nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould know what characters the women were to perform, maids, wives, or widows. Squallini told them they were all to be married ladies, and to appear with their hu&s;|bands. <Q>Then I am &s;ure (&s;ays Napi|oni, who was a very jealous man) I &s;hall not like it for one. Many im|proper liberties are taken with <HI>un|married</HI> women on the &s;tage; and if &s;o, I don't know what may happen to <HI>married</HI> ones.</Q> <Q>None (&s;aid Tor|riano, laughing) but what they are very well acquainted with.</Q> <Q> Be a&s;&s;ured (replied Squallini) the &s;tricte&s;t decorum will be ob&s;erved. It is a heavenly &s;ubject, and the &s;cene lies among the Gods and Godde&s;&s;es. It
<PB N="163" REF="162">is that of the Cele&s;tial Deities de|&s;cending upon earth to congratulate mankind on the return of Freedom. Tho&s;e nations that have emerged from de&s;poti&s;m, as England, France, Holland, and the like, are exhibited as triumphant; tho&s;e who continue &s;till enthralled as Spain, Turkey, Italy, and &s;o on, are &s;hewn in &s;ubjec|tion.</Q> <Q>A very high-flown &s;ubject indeed, (&s;ays Bavelli) and are your &s;ongs equal to the &s;ubject?</Q> <Q>Quite &s;o, (an&s;wered Squallini) I would give the public a &s;pecimen of a duet be|tween an angel of light and an angel of darkne&s;s;&mdash;But I &s;hall be obliged to leave it out, Pluto having &s;ent the latter on an emba&s;&s;y to Spain to
<PB N="164" REF="163">in&s;tigate them to make war with Germany, that he may be revenged of them for aboli&s;hing the inqui&s;i|tion.</Q> This occa&s;ioned a broad laugh. But Napioni a&s;ked what parts their three wives were to act? <Q>Juno, Pro&s;erpine, and Venus, (an&s;wered Squallini) as the wives of Jupiter, Pluto, and Vulcan.</Q> The&s;e fellows, ob&s;erved Napioni, are all very liquori&s;h dogs, and he &s;hould not like to tru&s;t his wife with either of them. <Q>What! not in heaven?</Q> &s;ays Bavelli. <Q>No not in heaven (an&s;wered Napioni)&mdash; I have heard of Jupiter's ravi&s;hing Io in a cloud.</Q> <Q>Don't be alarmed, gentlemen, (&s;aid Squallini) there's no harm to be feared. Their &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="165" REF="164">hu&s;bands are all opera-&s;ingers. Be|&s;ides it will be all in public.</Q> <Q>What of that? (retorts Napioni). The more public they &s;ay, the more private. Many an intrigue has been carried on in public. Jupiter violated Da|nae's honour in form of a &s;hower of gold; Leda in the &s;hape of a &s;wan; and Europa in that of a bull. I may in future have a parcel of &s;atyrs in|&s;tead of children.&mdash;Horns, my good friend, have frightened many a man.</Q> <Q>Well, Squallini, (&s;aid Torriano) you are welcome to the u&s;e of <HI>my</HI> wife. You &s;hall have the command of her for one night, and according to the Engli&s;h proverb, as &s;he <HI>can</HI> &s;ing, if &s;he <HI>won't</HI> &s;ing, I give you full power to <HI>make</HI>
<PB N="166" REF="165">her &s;ing.</Q> <Q>I have given my con&s;ent (&s;ays Bavelli) and &s;hall not retract, nor do I &s;uppo&s;e my friend Napioni will.</Q> <Q>Pardon me (replies Napi|oni) you can only an&s;wer for your|&s;elf.</Q> <Q>Sure (&s;aid Squallini) Napi|oni, you are not jealous?</Q> <Q>Cer|tainly not (returns Napioni)&mdash;but as you will naturally introduce an en|tertainment for your deities, and the nectar ambro&s;ial will be going about, I don't know what may be the con|&s;equence. Should my wife get a &s;ip of this nectar between her lips, her mouth may water for it for ever after. For ma&s;ter Pluto, I can't &s;ay much again&s;t <HI>him;</HI> but as to Jupiter and Vulcan, there are not wickeder
<PB N="167" REF="166">ra&s;cals in all the &s;kies.</Q> <Q>Well, (&s;aid Bavelli) the majority is again&s;t you. Two to one always carry it; &s;o you mu&s;t &s;ubmit.</Q> <Q>Mu&s;t! (re|turns Napioni),&mdash;If I mu&s;t, I mu&s;t; but take notice, Squallini, teach your gods to be well behaved; I &s;hall be pre&s;ent, and if I &s;ee them proceed to the lea&s;t earthly liberty, I'll put an end to the entertainment at once. I'll take her away in the mid&s;t of it.</Q>&mdash;<Q>You would not &s;urely (&s;ays Torriano) interrupt the performance?</Q> <Q>You would be the laugh and ridicule of the whole audience.</Q> <Q>No matter for that (returns Napioni). Every man &s;hould be the guardian, not only of his wife's honour, but his own.</Q>
<PB N="168" REF="167">After this altercation, it was &s;ettled that the ladies were to perform the parts a&s;&s;igned them, and the piece was to be performed. Colonel Ramble and his wife, were not pre&s;ent at the repre&s;en|tation. The colonel had bu&s;ine&s;s of greater moment on his hands, as the following chapter will &s;hew.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="44" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>THE important day being now ar|rived, when the minds of all parties were bu&s;y in their re&s;pective cares; when Ra&s;pe was anxious for the death of Ramble, Bravo for the death of Ra&s;pe, and Ramble and Brutus for the
<PB N="169" REF="168">life of Ra&s;pe. The evening being come, Ramble went to Mr. Ra&s;pe's lodgings, between eleven and twelve at night, armed with a pair of loaded pi&s;tols, and was admitted by Brutus into the apartments. His ma&s;ter, who&s;e di&s;turbed imagination made him very unhappy, went to his bed an hour &s;ooner than u&s;ual, leaving &s;trict orders with Brutus to &s;it up, and come and wake him as &s;oon as he learned that the deed was done. Ra&s;pe had two rooms, his bedchamber was the inner one, and ju&s;t at the door entering into the inner chamber was a window with a rece&s;s, before which a curtain was let down, &s;o that a per&s;on could &s;tand concealed very well behind this curtain; nor could
<PB N="170" REF="169">any one approach the inner chamber door, but that per&s;on could lay hold of him. The colonel was let in here a few minutes before twelve, and took his &s;tand behind the window-curtain I have de&s;cribed.&mdash;Ra&s;pe was then a&s;leep.&mdash; After continuing there concealed &s;ome minutes, he looked at his watch, and found it wanted but five minutes of the time.</P>
<P>Brutus, who &s;lept always on the floor by his ma&s;ter's bed, did not &s;o now&mdash; he was more upon the look-out. Ra&s;pe who had laid down in a morning gown, wanted no waking; his thoughts were &s;ufficient monitors; he to&s;&s;ed and flung about, and was heard to &s;ay, Dreadful
<PB N="171" REF="170">&s;lumbers!&mdash;no quiet &s;leep, when the mind's in agitation!&mdash;hope the bu&s;ine&s;s will be done effectually! The clock &s;trikes twelve. Ra&s;pe ri&s;es from his bed, comes into the outer room, and &s;hud|ders.&mdash; Hark! &s;aid he, This is the hour of bu&s;ine&s;s. My heart fails me, I'll to my bed again. He no &s;ooner re-entered his room, but the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, led in by Brutus, and armed with a dagger, came into the other room. "Tread &s;oftly," fays Brutus. "Which is his bed-room?" a&s;ks the fellow. "Dare," an&s;wered Brutus, pointing to it. "Is he a&s;leep?" &s;aid the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, [all this was in an under voice]. <Q>Yes, (replied Brutus) &s;noring as a hog.</Q> <Q>Know you where the money is?</Q> &s;ays the fellow. "Yes,"
<PB N="172" REF="171">an&s;wered Brutus. <Q>Well then, (re|turned the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in) we'll &s;ecure <HI>him</HI> fir&s;t&mdash;then the bag.</Q> The fellow now took out the dagger from his bo&s;om, and pa&s;&s;ing the curtain to go into the cham|ber, Ramble &s;tarted on him, &s;eized him by the wri&s;t that held the dagger, and pre&s;enting a pi&s;tol to his brea&s;t, &s;aid "Villain! I have thee." They &s;truggled, the colonel threw him down, wre&s;ted the dagger from him, and &s;tood over him with the dagger at his brea&s;t. Ra&s;pe hearing the noi&s;e, jumped from his bed, came to the door, and &s;eeing Ramble and the fellow under him, was &s;truck motionle&s;s. Brutus on the other hand was as much &s;urprized; but his &s;urprize was joy. After a pau&s;e, Ra&s;pe
<PB N="173" REF="172">advancing to Brutus, cried <Q>Satan! ha&s;t thou betrayed me?</Q> Ramble an|&s;wered for him <Q>No, Sir&mdash;he has not betray'd you, but &s;aved your life;</Q> and bidding Brutus call in the guard from without, with Ramble had brought with him, added, <Q>Con&s;ider this, Sir, as the mo&s;t fortunate hour of your life, prevented in the execution of a horrid crime, and &s;aved from the de&s;truction that awaited you in this world, and the mi&s;eries of a future one.</Q> Brutus now brought in two armed men; whom he ordered to bind the arms of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and take him to the inqui&s;itor-general, &s;aying he would &s;oon follow them. The man being bound and taken off, Brutus fri&s;ked,
<PB N="174" REF="173">rejoicing and crying. <Q>Brutus be &s;o glad!&mdash;no killee Ma&s;&s;a now!</Q>&mdash;and went after them. "Peace, varlet!" roar'd out Ra&s;pe; but Ramble checked him, with <Q>Be not angry with your &s;lave, to him you owe your life; had he not a heart that &s;hudders at the thought of vice, I &s;hould have been your victim, and you would have lived a martyr to remor&s;e. If you &s;till thir&s;t for my blood, take this dagger, and drink your fill&mdash;having &s;aved the life of the father of her who is next my heart, I can re&s;ign my own&mdash;but know that in the mo|ment you deprive me of exi&s;tence, you kill him who has &s;aved you, make your daughter a widow, bring her
<PB N="175" REF="174">with &s;orrow to the grave, and leave her unborn babe an orphan.</Q> It is not in the power of words to de&s;cribe the &s;ituation of Ra&s;pe's mind. The terror of the act he was about to perpetrate, the uncommon genero&s;ity, of the colo|nel, the love he bore his daughter, with the dread of impending ju&s;tice, cau&s;ed &s;uch a conflict of &s;oul within him, as would have unman'd the hardie&s;t vil|lain. He &s;elt the force of Ramble's words, became &s;en&s;ible of his own ra&s;h|ne&s;s, and &s;mitten with the &s;incere&s;t com|punction, held out the dagger he had taken from Ramble, blubbered like a child, and with broken accents cried, <Q>Whatever animo&s;ity I might have had&mdash;it drops with this weapon; [and
<PB N="176" REF="175">here he dropped it]. You have taught me, colonel, that anger de|prives a man of rea&s;on, and leads him often to &s;uch acts, as in a moment of reflection he would tremble at&mdash;Lead me to my child&mdash;I'll beg <HI>her</HI> forgive|ne&s;s, and implore her kind intere&s;t with you, to forget the wrong I meant to do you, and blot the remembrance of it from us all.</Q></P>
<P>Ra&s;pe was now reconciled to his daughter. They returned to England in harmony together. He gave her a fortune of 20,000l. and, at his death, left her near a hundred thou&s;and more, to her and her heirs; but in ca&s;e her hu&s;|band &s;urvived her, he was to have the in|tere&s;t
<PB N="177" REF="176">only for his life, and the principal at his death to be divided among his next of kin. They lived many years happily, but had no i&s;&s;ue. The colonel &s;urvived her, but never married again.</P>
<P>The reader may wi&s;h to know what be|came of Mi&s;s Trevor and Lady Da&s;hit. The former married well, and the latter fearful of a &s;econd &s;nare being laid for her, gave the idea of marriage up, and died a widow.</P>
