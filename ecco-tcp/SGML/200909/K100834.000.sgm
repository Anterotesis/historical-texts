<HEAD>OF THE PLAN and CONDUCT OF THE FAERIE QUEENE. SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the works of Homer and of Ari&s;to|tle began to be re&s;tored
and &s;tudied in Italy, when the pure and uncorrupted &s;ources of antient
poe&s;y and antient critici&s;m were opened, and literature in general &s;eemed
emerging from the depths of Gothic ignorance and barbarity, it might have been
expected, that, in&s;tead of the ro|mantic &s;pecies of poetical compo&s;ition
introduced by the provencal bards, a new and more legitimate ta&s;te of writing
would have &s;ucceeded; that unnatural events, the machinations of imaginary
beings, and adventures entertaining only as they were improba|ble, would have
given place to ju&s;tne&s;s of thought and de&s;ign, and to that decorum which
nature dictat|ed, and which the example and the precept of anti|quity had
authori&s;ed. But it was a long time before &s;uch a change as this was
effected; and we find A|rio&s;to, many years after the revival of letters,
reject|ing <PB N="2" REF="5"> truth for magic, and chu&s;ing rather to follow
the irregular and ridiculous excur&s;ions of Boiardo, than the propriety and
uniformity of the great Graecian and Roman Epic models. Nor was the &s;tate of
cri|tici&s;m le&s;s generally and effectually influenced than that of poe&s;y
by the re&s;toration of antient learning: Beni, one of the mo&s;t celebrated
critics of the &s;ix|teenth century, was &s;till &s;o infatuated with a love of
the old provencal vein, that he ventured to write a regular di&s;&s;ertation,
in which he compares Ario&s;to with Homer. Tri&s;&s;ino, indeed, who was nearly
con|temporary with Ario&s;to, had ta&s;te and boldne&s;s enough to publi&s;h a
poem written in profe&s;t imitation of the Iliad; but this attempt met with
little regard or ap|plau&s;e, for that very rea&s;on on which its real merit
was founded; it was rejected as an in&s;ipid and unen|tertaining performance,
having few devils or enchant|ments to recommend it. To Tri&s;&s;ino &s;ucceeded
Ta&s;&s;o, who, in his Gieru&s;aleme Liberata, took the antients for his
guides; but was, at the &s;ame time, too &s;en&s;ible of the prevailing ta&s;te
for ideal beings, and romantic de&s;cription, to omit them entirely; though he
was well acquainted with, and fully con|vinced of the excellencies of Homer and
Virgil, yet he &s;till kept the old provencal poets in his eye; like his own
Rinaldo, who after he had gaz'd on the dia|mond &s;hield of truth, and while he
was departing from Armida, and her enchanted gardens, could not help looking
back upon them with &s;ome remains of fondne&s;s. Nor did Ta&s;&s;o's poem,
though compos'd, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on a cla&s;&s;ical and uniform plan, gain
its author (in his own country at lea&s;t) any high|er <PB N="3" REF="6">
&s;hare of prai&s;e and reputation upon that account: Ario&s;to, with all his
extravagancies, was &s;till pre|ferred; and the &s;uperiority of the Orlando
Furio&s;o to the Gieru&s;aleme Liberata was at length e&s;tabli&s;h'd by a
formal decree of the Academicians della Cru&s;ca, who held a &s;olemn court of
enquiry concerning the merit of both poems.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this bad ta&s;te, Spen&s;er began to write his
FAERIE QUEENE; which, after the prac|tice of Ario&s;to, was to con&s;i&s;t of
allegories, enchant|ments, and romantic adventures, carried on by fairy
knights, giants, magicians, and fictitious beings. It may indeed be urged, as
an in&s;tance of Spen&s;er's weak and undi&s;cerning judgment, that he cho&s;e
to follow Ario&s;to rather than Ta&s;&s;o, the plan and conduct of who&s;e poem
was much more regular and legitimate than that of his rival. To this objection
it may be an&s;wered, in defence of our author, that he was rea|&s;onably
induced to follow that poem which was mo&s;t celebrated and popular: for tho'
the French critics in general gave the preference to Ta&s;&s;o, yet in Italy
the parti&s;ans, on the &s;ide of Ario&s;to, were by far the mo&s;t numerous,
and con&s;equently in England; for Italy, in the age of queen Elizabeth, gave
laws to our i&s;land in all matters of ta&s;te, as France has done ever
&s;ince. It mu&s;t, however, be confe&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time, that
Spen&s;er was in &s;ome mea&s;ure in|fluenced, from the natural bia&s;s of his
mind, to pre|fer that plan, which would admit of the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive range
for his unbounded imagination. What this plan is, and how it is conducted, we
&s;hall now proceed to examine.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Spen&s;er's letter
to Sir W. Raleigh, &amp;c.</NOTE>The poet &s;uppo&s;es, that the FAERIE QUEENE
held a magnificent fea&s;t, (according to annual cu&s;tom) which la&s;ted
twelve days; on each of which re&s;pec|tively, twelve &s;everal complaints are
preferred before her: accordingly, in order to redre&s;s the injuries which
were the occa&s;ion of the&s;e &s;everal complaints, &s;he &s;ends out twelve
different knights, each of which, in the particular adventure allotted to him,
proves an example of &s;ome particular virtue, as of Holine&s;s, Temperance,
Ju&s;tice, Cha&s;tity, &amp;c. and has one com|plete book a&s;&s;igned to him,
of which he is the hero. But, be&s;ides the&s;e twelve knights, &s;everally
exempli|fying twelve moral virtues, there is one principal knight, or general
hero, viz. PRINCE ARTHUR; who repre&s;ents Magnificence; a virtue which is
&s;uppo&s;ed to be the perfection of all the re&s;t; who a&s;&s;i&s;ts in
eve|ry book, the end of who&s;e actions is to find out GLO|RIANA, or Glory, and
in who&s;e per&s;on the poet in|tends to pourtray, 
<Q REND="inline">"THE IMAGE OF A BRAVE KNIGHT PERFECTED IN THE
TWELVE PRIVATE MORAL VIRTUES."</Q></P>
<P>It is evident, that our author, in e&s;tabli&s;hing one hero, who
&s;eeking and attaining one grand end, viz. GLORIANA, or Glory, &s;hould
exemplify one grand character, viz. that of a brave knight perfected in the
twelve private moral virtues, had the practice of Virgil and Homer in his eye.
But tho' he was &s;en&s;ible of the importance and expediency of a unity of the
hero and of his de&s;ign, yet he does not, at the &s;ame time, &s;eem convinced
of the nece&s;&s;ity of that unity of action, by which this de&s;ign &s;hould
be properly accompli&s;hed; nor &s;ufficiently acquainted with the method of
pro|ceeding <PB N="5" REF="8"> made u&s;e of by the two great originals
above|mentioned, in conducting their re&s;pective heroes to the one grand end
propo&s;ed. It may be a&s;ked, with great propriety, how does ARTHUR execute
this one grand ultimate de&s;ign? It may be an&s;wered, with no le&s;s
plau&s;ibility, that by a&s;&s;i&s;ting each patron of the twelve virtues
re&s;pectively, in his allotted defence or patronage of each, ARTHUR approaches
&s;till nearer and nearer to Glory, 'till at la&s;t he obtains it, and &s;o
con&s;ummates the intended grand de&s;ign. But &s;urely to a&s;&s;i&s;t only is
not &s;ufficient to gain this end, or com|plete the propo&s;ed character. The
poet ought to have made his ARTHUR the principal agent in the re|dre&s;s of
each particular wrong, which aro&s;e from the various violation of Holine&s;s,
Temperance, Ju&s;tice, Cha&s;tity, &amp;c. If the hero had thus, in his own
per|&s;on, exerted him&s;elf in the &s;ervice of all the twelve virtues, he
might have been de&s;ervedly &s;tiled the per|fect pattern of them all, and
con&s;equently would then have completed the propo&s;ed grand end, viz. the
attainment of Glory. At pre&s;ent he is only a &s;ubordinate, or rather
acce&s;&s;ory character; the diffi|culties and ob&s;tacles which he &s;hould
have &s;urmount|ed in order to gain the propo&s;ed end, are done to his hand,
and removed by others; it is not he who con|quers the dragon in the fir&s;t
book, (to in&s;tance in no other) or who quells the magician Bu&s;irane in the
third; the&s;e are atchievements executed by St. George and by Britomart. In
&s;hort, the twelve &s;everal knights, or patrons, do too much for ARTHUR to do
any thing, or at lea&s;t what may rea&s;onably be expected from the plan of the
poet; while we are attending to <PB N="6" REF="9"> the de&s;ign of the hero of
the book, we forget that of the hero of the poem. Mr. Dryden remarks, 
<Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t do Spen&s;er that ju&s;tice to
ob&s;erve, that mag|nanimity [magnificence] which is the true cha|racter of
PRINCE ARTHUR, &s;hines throughout the whole poem; and &s;uccours the re&s;t
when they are in di&s;tre&s;s."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dedication
to Juvenal.</BIBL></NOTE></Q> If the magnanimity of PRINCE AR|THUR did in
reality &s;hine throughout the whole poem with a &s;teady and &s;uperior
lu&s;tre, our author would &s;tand excu&s;ed; but at pre&s;ent it breaks forth
but &s;eldom, in dim and interrupted fla&s;hes; it is not like the pervading
&s;pirit of Virgil, which 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;<HI>Agitat molem, &amp; magno &s;e corpore
mi&s;cet.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Aen. vi. ver.
727.</BIBL></NOTE></L></Q> And to 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;uccour the re&s;t when they are in
di&s;tre&s;s,"</Q> is a circum&s;tance of too little importance in the hero of
a poem: "to &s;uccour" is, in fact, a &s;ervice to be perform'd in the cau&s;e
of the hero, by &s;ome dependent and inferior chief, the bu&s;ine&s;s of a Gyas
or a Cloanthus, a Mne&s;theus, or a Sere&s;tus.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, and in general, it mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved, that
Spen&s;er's adventures, which are the &s;ub|ject of each &s;ingle book, have no
mutual dependance upon each other, and con&s;equenly do not contribute to
con&s;titute one legitimate poem; and Mr. Hughes, not con&s;idering this, has
advanced a remark in com|mendation of Spen&s;er, which may mo&s;t properly be
turned to his cen&s;ure. 
<Q REND="inline">"If we con&s;ider the fir&s;t book as an entire
work of it&s;elf, we &s;hall find it to be no irregular contrivance: there is
one principal action, which is completed in the twelfth Canto, and the 
<PB N="7" REF="10"> &s;everal incidents are proper, as they tend either to
ob&s;truct or promote it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Remarks on the Fairy
Queen. Hughes's edit. of Spen&s;er's works, vol. 1.</BIBL></NOTE></Q> As the
heroic poem is required to be one WHOLE, compounded of many various parts
depending upon, and relative to each other; &s;o it is expedient, that not one
of tho&s;e parts &s;hould be &s;o regularly contriv'd, and &s;o completely
fini&s;hed, as to become a WHOLE of it&s;elf. For the mind being thus once
&s;atisfied in arriving at the completion of an orderly &s;eries of events,
acquie&s;ces in that &s;atis|faction, and its attention and curio&s;ity are
diverted from pur&s;uing, with due vigour, the final and general cata&s;trophe;
whereas while each part is left imperfect, I mean, incomplete, if disjoined or
&s;eparated from the re&s;t, the mind &s;till de&s;irous and eager of
gratify|ing its expectations, is irre&s;i&s;tibly and imperceptibly drawn on
from part to part, till it receives a full and ultimate &s;atisfaction from the
accompli&s;hment of one great event, which all tho&s;e parts, following and
il|lu&s;trating each other, contributed to produce.</P>
<P>Our author was probably aware, that by con&s;ti|tuting twelve
&s;everal adventures for twelve &s;everal knights, a want of continuity and
general concatena|tion of facts would be laid to his charge; and upon this
account, I &s;uppo&s;e, he &s;ometimes begins a &s;tory in one book, the
completion of which he defers, not without much interruption, to &s;ome future
and di|&s;tant book; a proceeding, which unavoidably occa|&s;ions much
confu&s;ion to the reader. And it &s;eems to be for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that,
after one of the twelve knights has fulfilled the adventure of his book, he
in|troduces <PB N="8" REF="11"> him, in the next book; acting, perhaps, in an
inferior light, and degraded to &s;ome le&s;s dangerous adventure; a conduct
which de&s;troys that repo&s;e which the mind feels after having accompanied a
hero, thro' various di&s;tre&s;&s;es and difficulties, to &s;ucce&s;s and
victory. Be&s;ides, when we view the hero entering upon an in|ferior attempt,
our former admiration is dimini&s;h|ed; having &s;een him once nobly and
deci&s;ively conquer, we become &s;o warmly intere&s;ted in his ho|nour, that
we look upon his engagement in any po|&s;terior enterpri&s;e (however
&s;ucce&s;sfully) which is le&s;s arduous than that of which we had ju&s;t
before hail'd him the conqueror, as derogatory to that glory which he had
ju&s;t acquired by &s;uch a conque&s;t. Spen&s;er, per|haps, would have
embara&s;&s;ed him&s;elf and the reader le&s;s, had he made every book one
entire detached poem, without any the lea&s;t reference to the re&s;t. Thus he
would have written twelve di&s;tinct poems, in all of which, he might have
completed the pattern of a particular virtue in twelve knights re&s;pectively;
at pre&s;ent, he has remarkably failed in endeavouring to repre&s;ent all the
virtues completed in the character of one. The poet mu&s;t either have
e&s;tabli&s;hed TWELVE KNIGHTS without an ARTHUR, or an ARTHUR without TWELVE
KNIGHTS. Upon &s;uppo&s;ition that Spen&s;er was re&s;olved to characteri&s;e
the twelve moral virtues, the former plan, perhaps, would have been be&s;t: the
latter mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily want &s;implicity, as it is an action
con&s;i&s;ting of twelve actions, all equally great, and unconnected between
them&s;elves; and not an action con&s;i&s;ting of one uninterrupted and
coherent chain of incidents tending to the accompli&s;h|ment of one
de&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12">It has been ob&s;erv'd before, that our author
endea|voured to expre&s;s the character of a knight perfected in the twelve
moral virtues, by repre&s;enting him as a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the &s;ervice or
defence of each, till at la&s;t he becomes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all: this plan,
however, in|judicious, he certainly was obliged to ob&s;erve; but in the third
book, which is &s;tiled the legend of Cha|&s;tity, PRINCE ARTHUR doth not &s;o
much as lend his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the protection or vindication of that
virtue; he appears indeed, but not as an auxiliary in the adventure of the
book.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, however, be confe&s;&s;ed, that there is &s;ome|thing
artificial in the poet's manner of varying from hi&s;torical preci&s;ion; a
conduct which may be be&s;t il|lu&s;trated from his own words. 
<Q REND="inline">"But becau&s;e the be|ginning of the whole work
&s;eemeth abrupt, and as depending upon other antecedents, it needs that ye
know the occa&s;ion of the&s;e three knights &s;everal adventures. For the
method of a poet hi&s;torical, is not &s;uch as of an hi&s;toriographer. For an
hi&s;to|riographer di&s;cour&s;eth of affairs orderly, as they were done,
accounting as well the times as the action; but a poet thru&s;teth into the
midde&s;t, even where it mo&s;t concerneth him, and there re|cour&s;ing to the
things forepa&s;t, and divining of things to come, maketh a plea&s;ing
analy&s;is of all. The beginning therefore of my hi&s;tory, were it to be told
by an hi&s;toriographer, &s;hould be in the twelfth book, which is the la&s;t;
where I devi&s;e, that the FAERIE QUEENE held her annual fea&s;t twelve days;
upon which twelve &s;everal days, the occa&s;ion of twelve &s;everal adventures
hap|pened: <PB N="10" REF="13"> which being undertaken by twelve &s;everal
knights, are, in the&s;e twelve books, &s;everally hand|led and
di&s;cour&s;ed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Letter to Sir W. Raleigh.</BIBL>
It appears, from this quotation, that Spen&s;er had fini&s;hed but three books,
when this letter was writ|ten.</NOTE>"</Q> Thus according to this plan the
reader would have been agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed, in the la&s;t book, when he
came to di&s;cover, that all the adventures which he had ju&s;t gone through,
were un|dertaken at the command of the FAERIE QUEENE, and that all the knights
had &s;everally &s;et forward to the execution of them from her annual
birth-day fe&s;ti|val; but Spen&s;er, in mo&s;t of his books, has
inju|diciou&s;ly fore&s;talled the fir&s;t of the&s;e particulars; which
certainly &s;hould have been concealed till the la&s;t book, not only to have
prevented a needle&s;s repe|tition of the &s;ame thing, but that he might
likewi&s;e &s;ecure an opportunity to him&s;elf of amu&s;ing the read|er's mind
with a circum&s;tance new and unexpected.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the plan and conduct of our author, in the
poem before us, is highly excep|tionable, yet I am apt to think, that the
FAERIE QUEENE is not, upon the whole, &s;o confu&s;ed and irregular as the
Orlando Furio&s;o. Though there is no general unity in the former, yet if we
con&s;ider every book or adventure as a &s;eparate poem, we &s;hall meet with
&s;o many di&s;tinct, however imperfect, uni|ties, by which means the reader is
le&s;s bewildered, than by that general indige&s;ted medley of which the former
totally con&s;i&s;ts, and in which we meet with neither partial, nor
univer&s;al unity.

<PB N="11" REF="14"> The very idea of celebrating the MADNESS of an hero,
carries with it &s;omewhat extravagant and ab&s;urd. Or|lando doth not make his
appearance till b. 8. where he is placed in a &s;ituation not very heroic; he
is fir&s;t di&s;covered to us in bed, de&s;iring to &s;leep. His ulti|mate
de&s;ign is to find Angelica, but his pur&s;uit of her is broken off in b. 30;
after which there are &s;ixteen more books to come, and in which Angelica
di&s;appears. Other heroes are likewi&s;e engaged in the &s;ame pur&s;uit.
After reading the fir&s;t &s;tanza of b. 1. one would be inclined to think,
that the &s;ubject of the poem was the expedition of the Moors into France,
under their emperor Agramante, to fight again&s;t Charlemayne; but this matter
is the lea&s;t part of the poem. In fact, many of the knights perform exploits
equal, if not &s;uperior to tho&s;e of Orlando; and particularly Rogero, with a
grand atchievement of wholn the poem is clo&s;ed, viz. his killing Rodo|mont;
but this event is not the completion of a &s;tory carried on principally
through the whole work. The author pa&s;&s;es from one incident to another, and
from region to region (whether it be from England to the He&s;perides, or from
the earth to the moon) with &s;uch incredible &s;wiftne&s;s and rapidity, that
one would think he was mounted upon his own winged &s;teed Ippogrifo. He begins
a tale of a knight in Europe, and &s;uddenly breaks it off to re&s;ume the
unfini&s;hed cata&s;trophe of another in A&s;ia. The imagination of the reader
is not &s;o much involv'd in, as it is oppre&s;&s;ed with the mul|tiplicity of
&s;tories, in the relation of each of which the poet is at the &s;ame time
equally engaged. To reme|dy this inconvenience, it was thought proper to affix,
<PB N="12" REF="15"> in &s;ome of the editions, marginal hints, informing the
reader in what book and &s;tanza the poet would recom|mence &s;ome interrupted
epi&s;ode; an expedient not more inartificial than that which the fir&s;t
painters were obliged to make u&s;e of, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t their want of
&s;kill, who having drawn the figure of a man, a bird, or a quadruped, found it
nece&s;&s;ary to write under|neath the name of the kind to which the thing
repre|&s;ented belonged. However, this method has been the means of giving the
reader a clear comprehen&s;ion of Ario&s;to's tales, which otherwi&s;e he could
not have obtained without much difficulty. This poet is &s;el|dom read twice in
order; that is, by pa&s;&s;ing from the fir&s;t canto to the &s;econd, and from
the &s;econd to the re&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; but by per&s;uing (without any
regard to the order of the books, or the &s;tanzas) the different &s;tories,
which though all &s;omewhere fini&s;h'd, yet are, at pre&s;ent, &s;o mutually
interwoven, that the incidents of one are perpetually cla&s;hing with tho&s;e
of another. The ingenious Abb&eacute; Du Bos 
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Reflexions, &amp;c. c.
34.</BIBL></NOTE> ob&s;erves hap|pily enough, that 
<Q REND="inline">"Homer is a geometrician in compari&s;on of
Ario&s;to:"</Q> And, indeed, his mi&s;|cellaneous matter cannot be better

<HEAD>SECT. II. Of Spen&s;er's Imitations from old Romances.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough Spen&s;er formed his FAERIE QUEENE upon the fanciful plan
of Ario&s;to, as I remark|ed in the preceding &s;ection, yet it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed, that the adventures of Spen&s;er's knights are a more exact and
immediate copy of tho&s;e which we meet with in old romances, or books of
chivalry, than they are of tho&s;e of which the Orlando Furio&s;o con&s;i&s;ts.
Ario&s;to's knights exhibit very &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;tances of their prowe&s;s,
and atchieve many heroic actions; but our author's knights are more
particularly engaged in revenging injuries, and doing ju&s;tice to the
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; which was the proper bu&s;ine&s;s, and ultimate end of the
antient knight-errantry. And thus though many of Spen&s;er's incidents and
expedients are to be found in Ario&s;to, &s;uch as that of blowing a horn, at
the &s;ound <PB N="14" REF="17"> of which the gates of a ca&s;tle fly open, of
the vani&s;h|ing of an enchanted palace or garden, after &s;ome knight has
de&s;troyed the enchanter, and the like, yet the&s;e are not more peculiarly
the property of Ario|&s;to, than they are common to all antient romances in
general. Spen&s;er's fir&s;t book is, indeed, a regular and preci&s;e imitation
of &s;uch a &s;eries of action as we frequently meet with in books of chivalry:
For in|&s;tance, a king's daughter applies to a knight, that he would relieve
her father and mother, who are clo&s;ely confined to their ca&s;tle, upon
account of a va&s;t and terrible dragon, that had ravaged their country, and
perpetually laid in wait to de&s;troy them. The knight &s;ets forward with the
lady, encounters a mon&s;ter in the way, is plotted again&s;t by an enchanter,
and after &s;urmounting a variety of difficulties and ob&s;tacles, arrives at
the country which is the &s;cene of the dra|gon's deva&s;tations, kills him,
and is pre&s;ented to the king and queen, whom he has ju&s;t delivered;
mar|ries their daughter, but is &s;oon obliged to leave her, on account of
fulfilling a former vow. It may be likewi&s;e ob&s;erved, that the
circum&s;tance of each of Spen&s;er's twelve knights, &s;etting out from one
place, by a different way, to perform a different adventure, exactly
re&s;embles that of the &s;even knights proceed|ing forwards to their &s;everal
expeditions, in the well-known romance, entitled the Seven Champions of
Chri&s;tendom. In fact, the&s;e miraculous books were highly fa&s;hionable, and
that chivalry, which was the &s;ubject of them, was &s;till practiced, in the
age of queen Elizabeth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Holling&s;head's
Chronicles, vol. iii. p. 1315.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18">Among others, there is one romance which
Spen|&s;er &s;eems more particularly to have made u&s;e of: It is entitled
MORTE ARTHUR, <HI>The Lyf of Kyng Arthur, of his noble Knyghtes of the round
table, and in thende the dolorous deth of them all.</HI> This was tran&s;lated

has copied from this book the circum&s;tances of his birth and education with
much exactne&s;s. Spen&s;er in|forms us that Sir Tri&s;tram was born in
Cornwall, &amp;c.

<P>Which is agreeable to what is &s;aid in the romance. After mention
being made of Tri&s;tram's having learn|ed <PB N="17" REF="20"> the language of
France, courtly behaviour, and &s;kill in chivalry, we have the following
pa&s;&s;age. 
<Q REND="inline">"As he growed in might and &s;trength, he laboured

varied from this de&s;cription; though there is one circum&s;tance in

<L>So dreadfully his hundred tongues did bray,</L> 
<BIBL>5. 12. 41.</BIBL></Q> By what has been hitherto &s;aid,
perhaps the reader may not be per&s;uaded, that Spen&s;er, in his BLATANT
BEAST, had the QUESTING BEAST of our romance in his eye; but the poet has
him&s;elf taken care to in|form us of this: for we learn, from the romance,
that certain knights of the round table were de&s;tined to pur&s;ue the
QUESTING BEAST perpetually without &s;ucce&s;s: which Spen&s;er hints at in
the&s;e lines. 
<Q> 
<L>Albe that long time after Calidore,</L> 
<L>The good Sir Pelleas him tooke in hand,</L>

<P>As Spen&s;er has copied many other fictions from MORTE ARTHUR, I
apprehend that he drew this from thence, and not from Geoffrey of Monmouth; not
to mention, that Spen&s;er's circum&s;tances tally more exactly with tho&s;e in
the romance.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="24">There is great rea&s;on to conclude, not only
from what has already been mention'd concerning Spen&s;er's imitations from
this romantic hi&s;tory of king Arthur and his knights, but from &s;ome
circum|&s;tances which I &s;hall now produce, that it was a favo|rite and
reigning romance about the age of queen Elizabeth; or at lea&s;t one very well
known and much read at that time. Spen&s;er in the Shepherd's Calen|dar has the
following pa&s;&s;age.

<P>Upon the words LADIES OF THE LAKE, E. K. the old commentator on
the pa&s;torals has the follow|ing remark. 
<Q REND="inline">"LADIES OF THE LAKE be nymphes: for it was an old
opinion among the antient Hea|thens, that of every &s;pring and fountaine was a
godde&s;&s;e the &s;overaine; which opinion &s;tucke in the minds of men not
many years &s;ince by meanes of certain fine fablers, or loo&s;e lyers; &s;uch

lee&s;ing of the LADIES OF THE LAKE."</Q> The&s;e fine fablers or loo&s;e
lyers, are the authors of the romance above-mention'd, viz. MORTE ARTHUR, where
many miracles are brought about, and much enchantment is carried on by the
means and interpo&s;ition of the LADY OF THE LAKE. Now <PB N="22" REF="25"> it
&s;hould be ob&s;erved, that the LADY OF THE LAKE was introduc'd to make part
of queen Elizabeth's en|tertainment at Kenelworth; as an evidence of which I
&s;hall produce a pa&s;&s;age from an antient book entit|led 
<Q REND="inline">"A letter, wherein part of the entertainment

deliver'd her, by concealing her in that lake; from which confinement the queen
is after|wards &s;uppos'd to deliver her, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Without expatiating upon the nature of &s;uch a royal

(and con&s;equently the romance which &s;upply'd this fiction) was a very
po|pular character in the reign of queen Elizabeth; and we may add, that it is
not improbable that Spen&s;er might allude in the above-cited ver&s;es to
&s;ome of the circum&s;tances in this part of the queen's entertainment; for
queen Eli&s;abeth, the Fayre Eli&s;a, is the lady whom the LADIES OF LAKE are

exhibited upon other occa&s;ions. Nor is it improper to remark in this place
that Ben. John&s;on has introduced her, together with king Arthur and Mer|lin,
in an entertainment before the court of James I. called PRINCE HENRIES
BARRIERS.</P>
<P>The above antient letter acquaints us, that the queen was
entertain'd with a &s;ong from this romance, which is another proof of it's
popularity at that time. 
<Q REND="inline">"A min&s;trall came forth with a &s;ollem &s;ong

<P>This is the &s;ong above hinted at, where mention is made of king

&s;hew'd &s;ome particular feats of activity before the queen, is &s;aid to be

written SANGREAL, or <HI>St. grale</HI> in MORTE AR|THUR, and is there &s;aid
to have been brought into England by Jo&s;eph of Arimathea. Many of king
Arthur's knights are there repre&s;ented as going in que&s;t, or in &s;earch of

<Q> 
<L>"What for weary, and what for faint</L> 
<L>"Sir Bevis was neere attaint:</L> 
<L>"The dragon followed on Bevis &s;o hard,</L>

<L>"Then was he glad without faile,</L> 
<L>"And re&s;ted awhile for his availe,</L> 
<L>"And drank of the water of his fill,</L> 
<L>"And then he leapt out of the well,</L> 
<L>"And with Morglay, his brand</L> 
<L>"A&s;&s;ailed the Dragon, I under&s;tand:</L>

which the Dragon &s;trikes the knight with &s;uch violence, that he falls into
a &s;woon, and tumbles as it were lifele&s;s into the well, by who&s;e
&s;overeign virtue he is reviv'd. 
<Q> 
<L>"When Bevis was at the ground</L> 
<L>"The water made him whole and &s;ound,</L> 
<L>"And quenched all the venim away,</L> 
<L>"This well &s;aved Bevis that day.</L></Q></P>

<L><PB N="36" REF="39">"He was as whole as any man,</L> 
<L>"And ever as fre&s;h as when he began.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>It may be ob&s;erv'd, that this poem of Sir Bevis is
written in that &s;hort mea&s;ure, which was frequently &s;ung to the harp in
queen Elizabeth's time: a cu&s;tom which de&s;cended from the antient bards.
The author of the arte of Engli&s;h poe&s;ie, printed 1589, thus &s;peaks of
it. 
<Q REND="inline">"So on the other &s;ide doth the
over-bu&s;ie and too &s;peedy returne of one manner of tune, too much annoy,
and, as it were, glut the eare, unle&s;s it be in &s;mall and popular

they have none other audience than boyes, or country fellowes, that pa&s;&s;e
by them in the &s;treete; or el&s;e by blind harpers, or &s;uch like
taverne-min&s;trels, that give a fit of mirth for a groat; and their matters
being, for the mo&s;t part, &s;tories of old time; as, the tale of Sir Topas,
the Reportes of Bevis of Southampton, Guy of Warwicke, Adam Bell, and Clymme of
the Clough, and &s;uch other old romances or hi&s;toricall Rhymes, made
purpo&s;ely for re|creation of the common people at Chri&s;tma&s;&s;e diners,
and bri|deales; and in tavernes, and alehou&s;es, and &s;uch other places of
ba&s;e re&s;ort: al&s;o they be us'd in carols and rounds, and &s;uch light or
la&s;civious poemes, which are commonly more commodiou&s;ly uttered by the&s;e
buffoons and VICES in plays, than by any other per&s;on: &s;uch were the rimes
of Skelton (u&s;urping the name of a poet laureate) being in deede but a rude
rayling rimer, and all his doings ridiculous; he u&s;ed both &s;hort
di&s;taunces and &s;hort mea&s;ures, plea&s;ing only the popular eare; in our
courtly MAKER we bani&s;h them utterly." 
<BIBL>B. ii. c. 9.</BIBL></Q> Hence it appears, that
Chaucer was, at that time, &s;ung to the harp; for the tale, or rime, of Sir
Thopas is a poem of Chaucer now extant: &s;o the Italians, at pre&s;ent, &s;ing
Ta&s;&s;o and Ario&s;to. Adam Bell and Clym of the Clough were two famous
archers: the former of which is, on that account, alluded to by
Shake&s;peare.</P> 
<P>The &s;ame author, in another place, &s;peaks of this kind
of enter|tainment, by which one would think that it was not always confin'd to
&s;uch a vulgar audience.

<P><PB N="38" REF="41">As to Spen&s;er's original and genealogy of
the Fairy nation, I am induc'd to believe, that part of it was &s;upply'd by
his own inexhau&s;tible imagination, and part by &s;ome fabulous hi&s;tory. He
tells us, B. ii. c. 10. S. 70. that man, as fir&s;t made by Prometheus, was
called ELFE, who wandring through the world, at la&s;t arriv'd at the gardens
of Adonis, where he found a female, whom he called FAY; that the i&s;&s;ue of
the&s;e two were called Fairies, who &s;oon grew to be a mighty people, and
conquer'd all nations. That their elde&s;t &s;on Elfin govern'd America, and
the next to him, named Elfinan, founded the city of Cleopo|lis, which was
enclos'd with a golden wall by Elfiline. That his &s;on Elfine overcome the
Gobbelines; but that, of all Fairies, Elfant was mo&s;t renowned, who built
Panthea of Cry&s;tall.&mdash;To the&s;e &s;ucceeded Elfar, who kill'd two
brethren-giants; and to him Elfinor, who built a bridge of gla&s;s over the
&s;ea, the &s;ound of which was like thunder. At length Elficleos rul'd the
Fairy land with much wi&s;dom, and highly en|creas'd its honour: he left two
&s;ons, the elde&s;t of which, fair Elferon, died an immature death, and
who&s;e place was &s;upply'd by the mighty Oberon, who&s;e wide memorial
(continues our author) &s;till re|mains, and who dying, left Tanaquil to
&s;ucceed him by will, who is likewi&s;e called Glorian, or GLORIANA.</P>
<P>In the circum&s;tance of Elfinel, who overcame the Gobbelines, he
plainly alludes to the faction of the Guelfes and Gibbelines in Italy; and his
friend and commentator E. K. remarks,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Eclogue,
June.</BIBL></NOTE> that our Elfes and <PB N="39" REF="42"> Goblins were
deriv'd from tho&s;e two parties Guelfes and Gibelines. But in the latter part
of this relation, under the fictitious names of the&s;e ideal beings, he has
adumbrated &s;ome of our Engli&s;h princes. Elficleos is king Henry VII,
who&s;e elde&s;t &s;on Arthur died at &s;ixteen years of age; and who&s;e
younge&s;t &s;on Oberon, that is, Henry VIII, &s;ucceeded to the crown,

queen Mary, who reigned between Henry VIII. and queen Elizabeth, but that he
pa&s;&s;es immediately from Oberon to Tanaquill, or GLORI|ANA, i. e. queen
Elizabeth, who was excluded from her right by tho&s;e two intermediate reigns.

<P>And the reader may ob&s;erve, that there is much ad|dre&s;s and
art in the poet's manner of making this o|mi&s;&s;ion. There is &s;o much
confu&s;ion in Spen&s;er's <PB N="40" REF="43"> &s;eries of this fairy people,
that it is difficult to deter|mine, whether or no he has here allegori&s;ed any
o|ther Engli&s;h reign. However in Elfant who laid the foundation of Cleopolis,
he may &s;ignify king Lud, as it appears, by another place, that Cleopolis is
London, 
<Q> 
<L>Till now, &s;aid then the knight, I weened well,</L> 
<L>That great Cleopolis where I have been,</L> 
<L>In which the faire&s;t FAERIE QUEENE doth dwell.</L></Q></P>
<P>The faire&s;t FAERIE QUEENE is queen Elizabeth: and by the lines
that immediately follow, it &s;hould &s;eem that Panthea is the queen's palace,

<P>But this idea of the cry&s;tall tower, and of the gold|en wall,
and bridge of gla&s;s, &amp;c. mention'd above, &s;eem to be &s;ome romantic
tradition. As to his FAE|RIE QUEENE, the notion of &s;uch a per&s;onage was
very common; Chaucer in his Rime of Sir Thopas &s;peaks of her, together with a
fairy land; and Shake|&s;pere who was univer&s;ally conver&s;ant in popular
&s;u|per&s;tition, has introduc'd her in his Mid&s;ummer|night's Dream. She was
&s;uppos'd to have held her court in the highe&s;t magnificence in the days of

<HEAD>SECT. III. Of Spen&s;er's u&s;e and abu&s;e of antient
hi&s;tory and mythology.</HEAD>
<P>AS Spen&s;er &s;ought to produce &s;urpri&s;e by extra|vagant
incidents, and fanta&s;tic de&s;criptions, the mythology of the antients
afforded matter no le&s;s co|pious than &s;uitable for &s;uch a de&s;ign. He
has ac|cordingly adopted &s;ome of their mo&s;t romantic fic|tions, in many of
which he has departed from the re|ceived tradition, as his purpo&s;e and
&s;ubject required. And, indeed, with regard to our author's
mi&s;repre|&s;entation of the fables of antiquity, it may be ob|&s;erved, that
from tho&s;e arguments which are pro|duced <PB N="45" REF="48"> again&s;t his
fidelity, new ones may be drawn in favour of his fancy. Spen&s;er's native
force of in|vention would not permit him to pur&s;ue the letter of pre&s;cribed
fiction with tame regularity and &s;cru|pulous exactne&s;s. In many particulars
he varies from antiquity merely that he may introduce new beauties, and
frequently mentions one or two circum|&s;tances of antient fable, not &s;o much
with a de&s;ign of adorning his poem with them, as of taking an oppor|tunity
from them, of rai&s;ing a new fiction of his own. He &s;ometimes, indeed,
mi&s;repre&s;ents the&s;e matters through ha&s;te; his allu&s;ions to antient
hi&s;tory are likewi&s;e very frequent, which in many in&s;tances he has not
&s;crupled to violate, with equal freedom, and for the &s;ame rea&s;ons.

<P>Ovid 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Met. ii. v. 760.</BIBL></NOTE> tells
us, that Envy was found eating the fle&s;h of vipers, which is not much unlike
Spen&s;er's picture. But our author has heighten'd this circum|&s;tance to a
mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting degree; for he adds, that the poy&s;on ran about her jaw.
This is, perhaps, one of the mo&s;t loath&s;om ideas that Spen&s;er has given
us, though he paints very &s;trongly (as Jortin ob&s;erves) B. i. i. 20.

31. and 7. 7. 40. In reality, the &s;trength of our author's imagination could
not be &s;uppre&s;s'd or kept in on any &s;ubject, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure it
is owing to the fullne&s;s of his &s;tanza, and the frequency of his rhymes,
that he has de&s;crib'd the&s;e di&s;agreeable ob|jects &s;o minutely. But to
return to his Envy. This per&s;onage is again introduc'd, 5. 12. 29. chawing a

<Q> 
<L>Then from her mouth the gobbet &s;he does take</L>

<L>The cur&s;ed &s;erpent, tho' &s;he hungrily</L> 
<L>Ear&s;t chaw'd thereon, yet was not all &s;o dead,</L>

<L>And as he pa&s;t before withouten dread,</L> 
<L>Bit him behind, that long the mark was to be read.</L></Q></P>
<P>It may be urg'd, that Spen&s;er drew the thought of her throwing
the Snake at him, from Alecto's attack upon Amata.

<P>But Spen&s;er's application of this thought, is &s;urely a much
greater effort of invention than the thought it&s;elf. The malignity both of
Envy, and of her Snake, <PB N="49" REF="52"> could not have been expre&s;t is
more &s;ignificant &s;trokes; tho' the &s;nake was her con&s;tant food, yet
&s;he was tempted to deprive her&s;elf of &s;u&s;tenance, that &s;he might
ca&s;t it at him; and tho' the &s;nake by being thus con|&s;tantly fed upon was
almo&s;t dead, yet it's natural ma|lignity enabled it to bite him violently.

<P>Among the&s;e per&s;onages, Milton's de&s;cription of Phonos, or

<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that this little poem of Milton, as containing
a council, con&s;piracy, and attempt of Sa|tan, may look'd upon as an early
prelu&s;ion of his ge|nius to the &s;ubject of the paradi&s;e lo&s;t.

<L>And in the mid&s;t thereof a &s;ilver &s;eat</L> 
<L>With a thick arbour, &amp;c.</L> 
<L>Next thereunto did growe a goodly tree.</L></Q></P>
<P>On this tree, he adds, grew golden apples; and that from this
likewi&s;e &s;prung the tree of the He&s;perides; but the&s;e circum&s;tances,
as al&s;o that of Pro&s;erpina's garden, &amp;c. is, I think, not to be
ju&s;tified from an|tient writers. He afterwards informs us, that the gold|en
apples by which Acontius won Cydippe, and that which Ate threw among the Gods,
were gather'd from <PB N="56" REF="59"> this tree: but the&s;e, as we learn
from many pa&s;&s;ages in the Cla&s;&s;ics, were the produce of the He&s;perian
tree abovemention'd. He then tells us, that the branches of this tree
over&s;pread the river Cocytus, in which Tantalus was plung'd up to the chin,
who was perpe|tually catching at its fruit, in which he copies Ho|mer, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure; who acquaints us, that many trees of delicious fruit wav'd
over the lake in which Tantalus was plac'd; but it does not appear, from him,
that Tantalus was fix'd in Cocytus, but in &s;ome lake peculiarly appropriated
to his puni&s;hment. 
<Q> 
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line">.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>Spen&s;er has al&s;o made another u&s;e of Cocytus, viz. that the
&s;hores of Cocytus perpetually re&s;ounded with the &s;hrieks of damned
gho&s;ts, who underwent an ever|la&s;ting puni&s;hment by being dipt in its
waters. Co|cytus, indeed, &s;ays antient fable, mu&s;t be pa&s;t, before there
is any po&s;&s;ibility of arriving at the infernal re|gions; but we do not
find, that it was a puni&s;hment allotted to any of the gho&s;ts, to be thus
plung'd into its waves; nor that this circum&s;tance was the cau&s;e of the
cries which echoed around its banks.</P>
<P>What he has invented of Cocytus, exhibits a fine image: he
&s;uppo&s;es, that when Sir Guyon came to this river, 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;He clomb up to the bank</L> 
<L>And looking downe &s;awe many damned wights</L> 
<L>In tho&s;e &s;ad waves; which direfull deadly &s;tanke,</L> 
<L><PB N="57" REF="60">Plonged continually of cruel

<BIBL>St. 57.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The antients tell us, that the golden apple, for which the
godde&s;&s;es &s;trove on mount Ida, was pluck'd in the garden of the
He&s;perides; but Spen&s;er's allego|ri&s;ing imagination feigns, that it grew
in hell. He might probably receive the hint of this tree with the golden apples
from Homer's mention of various trees which grew in hell, near the lake of
Tantalus, hinted at above; but the &s;ilver &s;tool beneath it is en|tirely his
own, which Mammon per&s;uades the knight to &s;eat him&s;elf upon, and is A NEW

was a name for Diana, viz. 
<Q>

<BIBL>v. 305.</BIBL></Q> She was a Cretan nymph, and the daughter
of Jupi|ter and Charme, whom Virgil has introduced, in his Ceiris, as the
nur&s;e of Scylla, and from whom our <PB N="61" REF="64"> author has copied his
Glauce, Britomart's nur&s;e, in the Canto mentioned above. She was called
Dictyn|na, becau&s;e &s;he invented nets for hunting, which be|ing al&s;o one
of Diana's names, Britomartis and Dia|na were look'd upon as the &s;ame.
Callimachus &s;peaks of her as one of the nymphs of Diana's train, but
ob&s;erves, that &s;he was called by the Cydonians, Dic|tynna. He has left us
the hi&s;tory of Britomartis in his hymn to Diana.

we may venture to affirm, that the fullne&s;s and &s;ignificancy of Spen&s;er's

<P>Dryden, I think, &s;omewhere remarks, that rhyme often helped him
to a thought; an ob&s;ervation, which, probably, Spen&s;er's experience had
likewi&s;e &s;upplied him with: Spen&s;er, however, mu&s;t have found more

We find in many pa&s;&s;ages of our author the orthography violated, when the
rhyme without &s;uch an expedient would be very exact; thus BITE when made to
rhyme with DELIGHT is &s;ome|times &s;pelt BIGHT, as if the eye could be

oc|cur often in Harrington's Ario&s;to, and more particu|larly of the word

<P>Hughes, not con&s;idering our author's cu&s;tom of

accuracy.</P>
<P>It is indeed &s;urpri&s;ing, upon the whole, that our author

and Chaucer's pieces made their appear|ance before it. It is divided into
twenty parts (PASSUS, as he &s;tyles them;) and con&s;i&s;ts of many di&s;tinct
vi&s;ions, which have no mutual dependance upon each other; &s;o that the poem
is not a regular and uniform whole, con&s;i&s;ting of one action or de&s;ign.
The author &s;eems to have intended it as a &s;atire on almo&s;t every
occupation of life, but more particularly on the clergy; in cen&s;uring whom,
Wickliff had led the way not many years before. This piece abounds with humour,
&s;pirit, and imagination; all which are dre&s;t to great di&s;advantage in a
very uncouth ver&s;ification, and ob&s;olete language. It &s;eems to be written
without rhyme, an ornament which the poet has endeavour'd to &s;upply, by
making every ver&s;e to con&s;i&s;t of words beginning with the &s;ame letter.
This practice has contributed not a little to render his poem ob&s;cure and
per|plex'd, exclu&s;ive of its ob&s;olete &s;tyle; for to introduce his
allitera|tion, he mu&s;t have been often nece&s;&s;arily compell'd to depart
from the natural and more obvious way of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf. The learned
Dr. Hickes ob&s;erves, that this alliterative ver&s;ification was drawn by
Langland from the practice of the Saxon poets, and that the&s;e vi&s;ions
abound with many Saxoni&s;ms.

manife&s;tly made u&s;e of for &s;ome of his plots. Tho&s;e who have undertaken
to point out the books from whence Shake&s;pere borrow'd his plots, have not, I
think, been able to di&s;cover the &s;ource from whence he drew the &s;tory of
his MERCHANT of VE|NICE; which, in all probability, is founded upon the
following antient ballad, which I met with in a large collection.</P> 
<P>A SONG, &s;hewing the crueltie of Gernutus a JEWE, who lending
to a marchant an hundred crownes, would have a pound of his fle&s;he, becau&s;e

premis'd, that the cunning and rapacious Jew is repre&s;ented, in our ballad,
to have lent an eminent merchant of Venice an hundred crowns, upon a bond, in
which promi&s;e of payment is made within a year and a day; under the
forfeiture of a pound of the merchant's fle&s;h, in ca&s;e of non-payment; that
the merchant, on account of his &s;hips being de|tain'd by adver&s;e winds, was
unable to perform his contract at the time appointed; that the affair was
referr'd to a judge; that the friends of the merchant offer'd ten thou&s;and
crowns to ab&s;olve him, but that the Jew ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in his
demand of the forfeited pound of fle&s;h.

</LG></Q> After which follows a moral exhortation,
re&s;ulting from the &s;ubject.</P> 
<P>It may be objected, that this ballad might have been written
after, and copied from, Shake&s;pere's play. But if that had been the ca&s;e,
it is mo&s;t likely that the author would have pre&s;erved Shake&s;pere's name
of Shylock for the Jew; and nothing is more likely, than that Shake&s;pere in
copying from this ballad, &s;hould alter the name from Gernutus to one more
Jewi&s;h; and by the alteration of the name his imitation was the better
di&s;gui&s;ed. Another argument (which would have appeared much more
convincing, had the whole &s;ong been tran&s;crib'd, but which perhaps will be
allowed from this extract) is, that our ballad has the air of a narrative
written before Shake&s;pere's play; I mean, that, if it had been written after
the play, it would have been much more full and circum&s;tantial: At pre&s;ent,
it has too much the nakedne&s;s of an original. Be&s;ides, the fir&s;t &s;tanza
informs us, that the &s;tory was taken from &s;ome Italian novel. Thus much
therefore is certain, that is, Shake&s;pere either copied from that Italian
novel, or from this ballad: Now we have no tran&s;lation, I pre&s;ume, of
&s;uch a novel into Engli&s;h; if then it be granted that Shake&s;pere
generally took his Italian &s;tories from their Engli&s;h tran&s;lations, and
that the arguments above, concerning the prior antiquity of this ballad are
true, it will follow that Shake|&s;pere copied from this ballad.</P> 
<P>I &s;hall only add, that it appears from S. Go&s;&s;on's
Schoole of Abu&s;e, printed 1579; that the character of a cruell and covetous
Jewe had been exhibited with good applau&s;e before Shake&s;pere's Shylock
appear'd. The author is commending &s;ome plays, and among the re&s;t, 
<Q REND="inline">"The JEWE and Ptolome &s;hewne at the bull;

<P><PB N="95" REF="98">Our author's di&s;approbation of this practice
may be made to appear more fully from his own words, <PB N="96" REF="99"> where

intro|duce, and accordingly they will generally be found at the end of his
lines. Thus the poverty of our tongue (or rather the unfrequency of identical
termi|nations in it) often compelled him for the &s;ake of rhyme, to coin new
Engli&s;h words, &s;uch as damni|fy'd, unmercify'd, wonderment, warriment,
unruli|ment, habitaunce, hazardrie, &amp;c. &amp;c. To this cau&s;e his many
latini&s;ms may likewi&s;e be attributed, which, like the re&s;t, are
&s;ub&s;tituted to make out the nece&s;&s;ary jingle.</P>

that the language of his age was ra|ther &s;trengthened and dignified, than
debas'd or di&s;|guis'd by &s;uch a practice. In truth, the affectation of
Spen&s;er in this point, is by no means &s;o &s;triking and vi&s;ible as
John&s;on has in&s;inuated; nor is our author &s;o ob&s;olete in his &s;tyle,

we may frequently read him with as much facility, as we can the &s;ame number

given us this minute and particular enumeration of various trees, has incurred
a &s;maller &s;hare of cen&s;ure than &s;ome of the Roman authors mentioned
above. In &s;ome of them, indeed, &s;uch a de&s;cription will be found
&s;uperfluous and im|pertinent; but, upon this occa&s;ion, it is highly
con|&s;i&s;tent, and, indeed, expedient, that the poet &s;hould dwell, for
&s;ome time, on the beauty of this grove, in de&s;cribing its variety of trees,
as that circum&s;tance tends to draw the red-cro&s;s knight and his compa|nion
farther and farther into the &s;hade, 'till at length <PB N="102" REF="105">
they are imperceptibly invited to the cave of error, which &s;tood in the

But notwith&s;tanding this may be affirm'd, in com|mendation of Spen&s;er, yet
I am apt to think, that the impropriety of introducing &s;uch a de&s;cription,
would not have appear'd a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to our poet, why he &s;hould
not have admitted it; for his judgment was &s;o greatly overwhelm'd by his
imagination, that he could never neglect the opportunity of a good
de|&s;cription, whenever it pre&s;ented it&s;elf. The reader will excu&s;e my
producing another pa&s;&s;age from Chaucer, in which he ridicules, with no
le&s;s humour than judg|ment, the particular detail of trees, and of the
circum|&s;tances which follow'd upon their being fell'd, given us by one of the

their being immediately derived from Chaucer. Thus here are &s;everal old old

property of him, than they are of Lidgate, of Gower, and of the au|thor of
Piers Plowman; &s;o that it would be difficult in &s;ome ca&s;es to a&s;certain

large&s;t draughts from Chaucer, 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;The well of Engli&s;h undefilde.</L></Q></P>
<P>I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ection without a wi&s;h, that this
neglected author whom Spen&s;er propo&s;ed in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, as the pattern
of his language, and to whom he is not a little indebted for many noble
&s;trokes of poetry &s;hould be more univer&s;ally and attentively &s;tudied.
Chau|cer &s;eems to be regarded rather as an old poet, than as a good one, and
that he wrote Engli&s;h ver&s;es four hundred years ago &s;eems more frequently
to be urged in his commendation, than that he wrote four hun|dred years ago
with ta&s;te and judgment. We look upon his poems rather as venerable relics,
than as fini&s;h'd patterns; as pieces calculated rather to gratify the
antiquarian than the critic. When I &s;ate down to read Chaucer with the
curio&s;ity of knowing how the fir&s;t Engli&s;h poet wrote, I left him with
the &s;atisfaction of having found what later and more refin'd ages could
hardly equal in true humour, pathos, or &s;ublimity. It mu&s;t 
<PB N="142" REF="145"> be confe&s;t that his uncouth or rather unfamiliar
lan|guage has deterr'd many from peru&s;ing him; but at the &s;ame time it
mu&s;t be allowed, that nothing has more contributed to his being little looked
into, than the convenient opportunity of reading him with faci|lity in modern
imitations. Thus when tran&s;lation (for &s;uch may imitations from Chaucer be
call'd) be|comes &s;ub&s;tituted as the means of attaining the knowledge of any
difficult and antient author, the original not only begins to be neglected and
excluded as le&s;s ea&s;y, but al&s;o to be de&s;pi&s;ed as le&s;s ornamental
and elegant. And thus tho' Mr. Pope's tran&s;lation of Homer is perhaps the
be&s;t that ever was made of any author, yet it has &s;o far indulg'd the
lazine&s;s or illi|teracy of many readers, as to tempt them to acquie&s;ce in
the knowledge of Homer acquir'd by it, as &s;uffici|ent; and thus many have
preferr'd that tran&s;lation to the Graecian text, in proportion as the former
contains more frequent and more &s;hining metaphors, more lively
de&s;criptions, and in general appears to be more full, elaborate, and
various.</P>

mon&s;trous and unnatural bea&s;t, imitated, or ra|ther vyed with Ario&s;to,
who has repre&s;ented avarice and jealou&s;y under the picture of two hideous

alike, enters the palace as well the cottage, but vents his rage in a more
particular manner again&s;t the clergy, &s;paring not even the pope him&s;elf.
She is at la&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed to be bound by Leo the tenth, as Jealou&s;y is
&s;uppo&s;ed to be driven to her den by Renaldo. It is not improbable, that
Ario&s;to, in adumbrating the&s;e violent pa&s;&s;ions under the figure of
bea&s;ts, form'd of many unnatural combinations, might have an eye to the

<P>I had almo&s;t forget to take notice, that our author, in his

of Amazons.</P>
<P>But although Spen&s;er appears to have imitated, and
con&s;equently to have admir'd Ario&s;to, from a &s;urvey of the preceding
in&s;tances; and to have been ambi|tious of rivalling the Orlando Furio&s;o, in
compo&s;ing a poem upon a kindred and &s;imilar plan; yet it may be affirmed,
that they were both of a genius entirely different. Spen&s;er, amid&s;t all his
ab&s;urdities, abounds with beautiful and &s;ublime repre&s;entations; while
A|rio&s;to's &s;trokes of true poetry bear a very &s;ignal di&s;|proportion, in
their number, to his &s;allies of roman|tic imagination: he gives us the
grote&s;que for the graceful, and extravagance for maje&s;ty: he frequent|ly
moves our laughter and &s;urpri&s;e by the whim&s;ical figures of a Callot, but
&s;eldom awakens our admira|tion by the ju&s;t portraits of a Raphael. To
confe&s;s the truth, Ario&s;to's vein is &s;o far different from Spen|&s;er's,
that it is ab&s;olutely comic, and infinitely better &s;uited to &s;cenes of
humour, than to &s;erious and &s;o|lemn de&s;cription; he &s;o greatly excels
in painting the familiar manners, that what are call'd his tales, are, by far,
the mo&s;t &s;hining pa&s;&s;ages in his poem. Many of <PB N="158" REF="161">

<HEAD>SECT. VII. Of Spen&s;er's Inaccuracies.</HEAD>
<P>FEW poets will appear to have written with greater rapidity than
Spen&s;er. Hurried on by the vehe|mence of imagination he frequently cannot
find time to attend to the niceties of con&s;truction, or to &s;tand &s;till
and revi&s;e what he has before written, in order to prevent contradiction,
incon&s;i&s;tency, or repetition. Hence it is, that he not only fails in the
connection of &s;ingle words, but of circum&s;tances, and not only violates the
rules of grammar, but tho&s;e of truth, probability and propriety. He was more
&s;ollicitous about giving bold than exact touches to his figures, and was &s;o
earne&s;tly intent of forming what was great, that he forgot to produce that
which was correct. So that if, with the&s;e inaccuracies, we con&s;ider the
irregu|larity of Spen&s;er's plan in general, we may venture to conclude, that
no poet ever &s;hewed more imagi|gination with le&s;s judgement, than the
author of the FAERIE QUEENE. It may be looked upon as a very officious piece of
ill-nature to draw together the&s;e in|ferior and &s;ubordinate faults, and

<L>Aread, prince Arthur&mdash;</L></Q> </P>
<P>Arthur and Una have been hitherto repre&s;ented as entire
&s;trangers to each other; and it does not appear how Una became acquainted
with the name of this new knight.</P>
<Q><BIBL>B. i. C. viii. S. xliii, &amp;c.</BIBL></Q>
<P>It is unnatural, that the red-cro&s;&s;e knight &s;hould be &s;o
&s;uddenly reconcil'd to Una, after he had for&s;aken her for her &s;uppo&s;ed
infidelity and impurity. The poet &s;hould certainly have expre&s;s'd an
eclairci&s;&s;e|ment between them.</P>
<Q><BIBL>B. vi. C. xi. S. li.</BIBL> </Q>
<P>It was an in&s;tance of Sir Calidore's courage, to re|&s;tore to
Coridon his flocks; but not of his courte&s;ie, to carry away his love
Pa&s;torella. The poet &s;hould have manag'd the character of his PATRON OF
COUR|TESIE with more art.</P>
<P>As Spen&s;er has drawn the character of his hero prince Arthur
from hi&s;tory, he has limited him&s;elf to a particular period of time, in
which all the events of his poem, however fictitious or imaginary, are
&s;up|po&s;ed to have happen'd: upon this account all di&s;co|veries made
&s;ince that particular period of time, are <PB N="173" REF="176"> improperly
&s;pecified; and the mention of them may be ju&s;tly term'd an anachroni&s;m.
Our author has been guilty of one or two faults of this kind, which we &s;hall
lay before the reader. 
<Q> 
<L>And evermore their hideous ordinance,</L> 
<L>Upon the bulwarkes cruelly did play.</L> 
<BIBL>2. 11. 14.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Spen&s;er &s;hould have &s;par'd this circum&s;tance of fire-arms.
Ario&s;to was more cautious in this matter; for tho' he has &s;uppos'd the
u&s;e of them upon a par|ticular occa&s;ion in the age of Charlemagne; yet,
not|with&s;tanding, he hints, that they were &s;oon after|wards de&s;troy'd,
and that the u&s;e of them was not re|viv'd till many years after; and as the
invention, &s;o the revival of them is attributed to the devil. C. 11. S. 22.
It has been ob&s;erv'd, that Milton copied the invention of fire-arms from
Ario&s;to; and it may fur|ther be ob&s;erv'd, that Milton, in the &s;peech
which one of the evil angels makes upon them, 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;They &s;hall fear we have di&s;arm'd</L> 
<L>The thunderer of his only dreaded bolt,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Par. L. 6. 490.</BIBL></NOTE></L></Q> has copied from
him&s;elf, in one of his latin epigrams.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>There are other &s;trokes likewi&s;e in Milton's le&s;&s;er
poems, which he has transferr'd into his GREAT WORK. Thus in SAMSON
Agoni&s;tes, 
<Q>

&s;ighs,</L> 
<L>And amorous reproaches, to win from me</L>

<L>THRICE I deluded her.&mdash;</L> 
<BIBL>v. 392.</BIBL></Q> This form he has exactly repeated in
PARADISE LOST. 
<Q> 
<L>THRICE HE ASSAY'D, and THRICE, in &s;pite of &s;corn,</L>

Greek Tragedies, founded upon the&s;e &s;tories made an early, and
con&s;equently a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion upon Milton. In his fir&s;t elegy to
Diodatus, written before he was arriv'd at his twentieth year, he
particulari&s;es them, where (as in the lines ju&s;t cited) he is &s;peaking of
tragedy in general.

<P>It has been before remark'd, that Milton takes all
opportunities of illu&s;trating the power of mu&s;ic, and of expre&s;&s;ing his
extreme fond|ne&s;s for it: The&s;e ver&s;es, in COMUS, relating to that

<BIBL>14. 476.</BIBL></Q> But &s;hall we &s;u&s;pect Milton
of plagiari&s;m becau&s;e the Roman poet wrote FIRST? was it not NATURAL for
either poet in expre&s;&s;ing the force of mu&s;ic in the ISLE OF SICILY, to
mention it's influence on two mo&s;t implacable objects, which the SITUATION of
the Mu&s;i|cian, in both ca&s;es, &s;ugge&s;ted?</P> 
<P>The fable of the garden of the He&s;perides &s;eems to have
affected the imagination of Milton in a very particular manner, as his

di&s;tin|gui&s;hed a lu&s;tre in the PARADISE LOST, di&s;cover'd it&s;elf in
&s;ome of his mo&s;t early productions. In the juvenile poems we meet with

Venus, 4. 10. all which, though, in general, the &s;ame, his invention has
diver&s;ified with many new circum&s;tances; as it has likewi&s;e his Mornings:
and perhaps we meet with no poet who has more re|quently, or more minutely, at
the &s;ame time, de|lineated the Morning, than Spen&s;er. He has intro|duced
two hi&s;torical genealogies of future kings and princes of England, 3. 3. and,
2. 10. be&s;ide two or three other &s;horter &s;ketches of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory.
He often repeatedly introduces his allegorical figures, which he &s;ometimes
de&s;cribes with very little variation from his fir&s;t repre&s;entation;
particularly, DISDAIN, FEAR, ENVY, and DANGER. In this poem we like|wi&s;e meet

&s;ame point, than this. That which appears a lucky cor|rection or alteration
to one commentator, is rejected by another, as ab&s;olutely improbable and

dictated by the different manner of conceiving things, which nature has

confe&s;s that <HI>alive</HI> is &s;uperfluous, but Spen&s;er has run into many
other &s;uperfluities on account of the frequency of his rhyme. Mr. Upton
propo&s;es likewi&s;e to write Earth [<HI>His Mother Earth</HI>] with an

confe&s;s'd, that this is &s;uch an ab&s;urd mixture as Spen|&s;er was very
likely to have fallen into; and we have numberle&s;s in&s;tances of this fault,
in his account of the rivers which attended the marriage of Thames and Medway,

is the &s;pecies of the Drop&s;y &s;o call'd, the <HI>dry Drop&s;y</HI> or
<HI>Tympanites</HI>; which Spen&s;er has inaccurately confounded with the other
&s;pecies of the Drop&s;y, which may not improperly be <PB N="210" REF="213">
&s;aid to <HI>flow through the fle&s;h</HI>; not con&s;idering the

objected to the following words, DRY <HI>Drops.</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>And with DRY DROPS congealed in her eye.</L> 
<BIBL>2. 1. 49.</BIBL></Q> By the way, it will be difficult

<L>Pardon the error of <HI>enraged</HI> wight.</L> 
<BIBL>S. 41.</BIBL></Q> But becau&s;e the Paynim is angry, doth
it nece&s;&s;arily follow, that the Elfin knight &s;hould not be &s;o too? He
certainly has rea&s;on to be enraged and angry after <PB N="211" REF="214">
that bitter taunt, which provokes him to throw down his gauntlet, as a
challenge. It is &s;urely wrong to alter the text, when there is neither

Mr. Upton thus reads the la&s;t line, 
<Q> 
<L>Both tho&s;e AND TH' lawrel garlands to the victor

garlands are metaphorically u&s;ed, and put in appo&s;ition with Due&s;&s;a,
and Sans foy his &s;hield. It may be urg'd, as another objection to Mr. Upton's
alteration, that Spen&s;er never cuts off the vowel in THE before a

<HEAD>SECT. X. Of Spen&s;er's Allegorical Character.</HEAD>
<P>IN reading the works of an author who lived in a remote age, it is
nece&s;&s;ary, that we &s;hould look back upon the cu&s;toms and manners which
prevailed in his age; that we &s;hould place our&s;elves in his &s;i|tuation,
and circum&s;tances; that &s;o we may be the bet|ter enabled to judge and
di&s;cern how his turn of thinking, and manner of compo&s;ing were bia&s;s'd,
in|fluenc'd, and, as it were, tinctur'd, by very familiar and reigning
appearances, which are utterly different from tho&s;e with which we are at
pre&s;ent &s;urrounded. For want of this caution, too many readers view the
knights and dam&s;els, the turnaments and enchant|ments of Spen&s;er with
modern eyes, never con&s;ider|ing that the encounters of Chivalry
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted in our author's age, as has been before hinted<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Sect. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>; that ro|mances were
then mo&s;t eagerly and univer&s;ally read; and that thus, Spen&s;er from the
fa&s;hion of his age, was naturally di&s;pos'd to undertake a recital of
chivalrous atchievements, and to become, in &s;hort, a ROMANTIC POET.</P>
<P>Nor is it &s;ufficiently con&s;ider'd, that a prevalent practice
of Spen&s;er's age contributed in a very con&s;i|derable <PB N="218" REF="221">
degree to make him an ALLEGORICAL POET. It &s;hould be remember'd that, in the
age of which we are &s;peaking, allegory was the &s;ubject and foun|dation of
public &s;hews and &s;pectacles, which were then exhibited with a magnificence
&s;uperior to that of former times; that the vices and virtues per&s;onify'd,
and repre&s;ented by living actors, di&s;tingui&s;h'd with their re&s;pective
emblematical types, were generally in|troduc'd to con&s;titute PAGEANTRIES,
which were then the principal entertainments, and &s;hewn not only in private,
and upon the &s;tage, but very frequently in the open &s;treets, for
&s;olemni&s;ing any public occa&s;ion. As a proof of what is here advanc'd, I

Spen&s;er's manner of allegorizing &s;eems to have rather re&s;ulted from
&s;ome of the &s;pectacles ju&s;t mention'd, than from what he had red in

the like. Ario&s;to gives us but few of the&s;e &s;ymbolical beings, in
compari&s;on of Spen&s;er; and tho&s;e which he has given us, are by no means
drawn with that fullne&s;s and di&s;tinctne&s;s with which they are painted by
the latter. And that Spen&s;er painted the&s;e figures &s;o fully and
di&s;tinctly, may we not rea&s;onably attribute it, to his being frequently
ha|bituated to the &s;ight of the&s;e &s;ymbolical beings, di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd

<P>As a more convincing argument in confirmation of what has been
a&s;&s;erted upon this head, it may be re|mark'd, that Spen&s;er denominates
his mo&s;t exqui&s;ite groupe of allegorical figures, the MASKE OF CUPID; thus,
without recurring to conjecture, his own words indubitably demon&s;trate, that
he had &s;ometimes repre|&s;entations of this &s;ort in his eye: he tells us,

<P>In&s;tead of entering into an examination of Spen&s;er's manner of
allegori&s;ing, and of the conduct of his allegories in particular, which has
been done with an equally judicious and ingenious di&s;cernment by Mr.
Spen&s;e;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Polymet. B. 10. D. 4.</BIBL> To
Mr. Spen&s;e's examination it may be added, that our author frequently
introduces an allegory, under which no meaning is couch'd; viz. 2. 9. 21. ALMA
is the mind, and her CASTLE the body. The tongue is the porter of this
ca&s;tle, the no&s;e the Portcullis, and the mouth the porch, about the
in&s;ide of which are placed twice &s;ixteen warders clad in white, which are
the teeth; the&s;e ALMA pa&s;&s;es by, who ri&s;e up, and do obey&s;ance to
her. St. 26. But how can the teeth be &s;aid to ri&s;e up and bow to the mind?
Spen&s;er here forgot that he was allegori&s;ing, and &s;peaks as if he was
de&s;cribing (without any latent meaning) a real queen, with twice &s;ixteen
real warders, who, as &s;uch, might, with no improprie|ty, be &s;aid to ri&s;e
and bow to their queen. Many in&s;tances of his confounding allegory with
reality, occur through this whole Canto, and the two next; particularly, where
he is de&s;cribing the kitchen of this ca&s;tle, which is the belly, he gives
us a formal de&s;cription of &s;uch a kitchen, as was to be &s;een in his time
in ca&s;tles, and great hou&s;es, by no means expre&s;&s;ive of the thing
intended. Again, the occult meaning of his bringing Scudamore to the hou&s;e of
CARE, 4. 5. 32. cla&s;hes with what he had before told us. By this allego|ry of
Scudamore coming to CARE's hou&s;e, it &s;hould be UNDER|STOOD, that 
<Q REND="inline">"Scudamore, from a happy, pa&s;s'd into a
mi&s;erable &s;tate."</Q> For we may rea&s;onable &s;uppo&s;e, that before he
came to CARE's hou&s;e, he was unacquainted with CARE; whereas the poet had
before repre&s;ented him as involv'd in extreme mi&s;ery. It would be tedious,
by an allegation of particular examples, to de|mon&s;trate, how frequently his
allegories are mere de&s;criptions; and that, taken in their literal &s;en&s;e,
they have an improper, or no &s;ig|nification, veil'd under them. I &s;hall,
however, mention one. The BLATANT BEAST is &s;aid to break into the
mona&s;teries, to rob their chancels, ca&s;t down the de&s;ks of the monks,
deface the altars, and de&s;troy the images found in their churches. By the
BLATANT BEAST is under&s;tood Scandal, and by the havock ju&s;t mentioned as
effected by it, is implied the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of religious hou&s;es and
popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition. But how can this be properly &s;aid to have been
brought about by &s;candal? and how could Spen&s;er, in parti|lar, &s;ay this,
who was, as it appears by his pa&s;torals, a friend to the reformation, as was
his heroine Queen Elizabeth?</NOTE> I &s;hall mention one capital fault
committed by the poet in this point, which does not immediately fall under the
rules of critici&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="226"> 
<Q REND="inline">"Painters, &s;ays a French writer, ought to employ
their allegories in religious pictures, with much greater re&s;erve than in

HOPE &s;upporting a dying per&s;on, and RELIGION in deep affliction at the feet
of a decea&s;ed prelate. But I am of opinion, that arti&s;ts who treat of the
mira|cles and dogmas of our religion, are allowed no kind of allegorical
compo&s;ition.&mdash;The facts whereon our religion is built, and the doctrine

only; that the painters here condemned are &s;uppo&s;ed to adapt human allegory

allegory. Such a practice as this, is not only to con|found &s;acred and

<P>One Machabree, a French poet, wrote a de&s;cription, in
ver&s;e, of a proce&s;&s;ion painted on the walls of St. Innocent's cloi&s;ter
at Pa|ris, called the DANCE OF DEATH. This piece was tran&s;lated by Lydgate,

richly painted the Dance of Machabray, or DANCE of DEATH, commonly called the

into Engli&s;h by John Lidgate, Monk of Bury, and with the picture of Death
leading all e&s;tates, painted round the cloy&s;ter."</Q> pag. 264. This
picture is a wood|cut, and prefixed to the poem we are &s;peaking of, in
Tottell's edi|tion of Lydgate, 1555; and is, I &s;uppo&s;e, an exact
repre&s;entation of what was painted in St. Paul's cloi&s;ters. It was
afterwards en|graved by Hollar, in Dugdale's Mona&s;t. vol, 3. p. 368. In all
probability, this painting at St. Paul's, or that (which was the &s;ame) at St.
Innocent's, gave Hans Holbein the hint for compo&s;ing his famous piece, call'd
the DANCE OF DEATH, now to be &s;een in the town-hou&s;e at Ba&s;il.</P> 
<P>It is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, that the wood-cuts, from whence
Hol|lar engraved his exqui&s;ite &s;ett of prints, entitled the DANCE OF DEATH,
were executed by Holbein: but I am apt to think this a mi&s;take, which aro&s;e
from confounding Holbein's picture, above|mentioned, with the&s;e wood-cuts.
For it will appear, that Hol|bein's manner of cutting in wood, is entirely
different from that in which the&s;e are fini&s;hed, by comparing them with
Holbein's &s;crip|tural wood-cuts (in one of which his name is engraved at full
length) in&s;erted in archbi&s;hop Cranmer's catechi&s;m, an. 1548. In the cuts
of this catechi&s;m there is a delicacy of handling, by no means to be found in
tho&s;e of the DANCE OF DEATH; which, however, have an inimitable
expre&s;&s;ion, and are mo&s;t probably the work of Albert Durer. I am not
ignorant, that Rubens, who had copied this DANCE OF DEATH, recommended them to
Sandrart, as the performance of Holbein: of which Sandrart him&s;elf informs
us. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Sic memini,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;I al&s;o
well remember, that, in the year 1627, when Paul Rubens came to Utrecht to
vi&s;it Handor&s;t, being e&s;corted, both coming from, and returning to
Am&s;terdam, by &s;everal arti&s;ts, as we were in the boat, the conver&s;ation
fell upon Holbein's book of cuts, repre&s;enting the DANCE OF DEATH; that
Rubens gave them the highe&s;t encomiums, ad|vi&s;ing me, who was then a young
man, to &s;et the highe&s;t value upon them, informing me, at the &s;ame time,
that he, in his youth, had copied them."

&s;tiled the&s;e prints Holbein's, in familiar conver&s;ation, it was but
calling them by the name which the world had given them, and which they
generally went by. In another place Sandrart evidently confounds the&s;e
wood-cuts with Holbein's picture at Ba&s;il. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Sed in foro, &amp;c.</HI> But in the

poets, to which <PB N="232" REF="235"> his language entitled him, rather than
his ima|gination; for though he is a very unaminated writer, yet he made very
con&s;iderable improvements in the original &s;tate of our Engli&s;h
ver&s;ification, by writing in &s;o polite a &s;tyle; and it ought not to be
denied, that Lydgate is the fir&s;t Engli&s;h poet, who can be red without
he&s;itation and difficulty. To Lydgate &s;ucceeded John Harding, who wrote a
Chro|nicle, in ver&s;e, of all our Engli&s;h kings, from Brutus to the reign of
king Edward IV. in which he liv'd. This piece is often commended, and quoted by
&s;ome of our be&s;t antiquaries. But his merit, as an hi&s;to|rian, naturally
excludes him from that which he &s;hould arrogate as a poet: accuracy in
collecting, and fideli|ty in relating events, may be, perhaps, ju&s;tly allow'd
him, but not the lea&s;t effort of invention. So that, from the &s;pecimen
produced by Harding at this time, there was &s;ome rea&s;on to pre&s;age, that
poe&s;y was re|lap&s;ing into its primaeval barbari&s;m; and that the
rudene&s;s of Robert of Glouce&s;ter, would be rein&s;tated 
<PB N="233" REF="236"> in the place of Chaucer's ta&s;te, judgement, and
imagination.</P>
<P>However in the reign of Henry VII. ample amends were made for this
interval of darkne&s;s by Stephen Hawes, a name generally unknown, and not
menti|oned by any Engli&s;h compiler of the lives of Engli&s;h poets, but by
the accurate Wood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Fa&s;t. Oxon.</BIBL></NOTE>.
This author I look upon to be the re&s;torer of invention in our poetry,
who&s;e &s;treams had flow'd in a current &s;till more polluted and
&s;luggi&s;h, ever &s;ince the time of Chaucer. He not only reviv'd, but highly
improved the an|tient allegoric vein, which the rhyming chronicle of the la&s;t
mentioned poet had (as I before hinted) now totally expelled. In&s;tead of that
dryne&s;s and har&s;h|ne&s;s of de&s;cription which are &s;o remarkably
di&s;gu&s;ting in his predece&s;&s;ors, we are by this author often
enter|tained with the fullne&s;s and luxuriancy of Spen&s;er-Hawes refin'd
Lydgate's ver&s;ification, and gave it, what it wanted, &s;entiment and
invention; added new graces to the &s;even-lined &s;tanza, which Gower and
Chaucer fir&s;t introduced into our tongue from the Italian; and, to &s;um up
all, was the fir&s;t of our poets, who taught fertile fancy, and high-wrought
fiction to wear the garb of per&s;picuous and harmonious numbers. The title of
his poem is almo&s;t as univer&s;ally un|known as his name, and is as follows.

lu&s;tre in this i&s;land; and this age is perhaps the fir&s;t which England
ever &s;aw, that may with pro|priety be &s;tyled cla&s;&s;ical; as it was
dignify'd with the great names of Sir Thomas More, Colet, dean of St. Paul's,
Cheke, A&s;cham, together with many more illu&s;trious rivals in genius and
erudition Nor is it the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable honour of this age, that
Era&s;|mus was now entertained and patronized in England; and that the Greek
language, in which are repo&s;ited the trea&s;ures of true learning now began
to be taught and admir'd. In this age flouri&s;h'd John Skelton, who
notwith&s;tanding the great and new lights with which he was &s;urrounded,
contributed not the lea&s;t &s;hare of improvement to what his ance&s;tors had
left him; nor do I perceive that his ver&s;ification is in any degree more
poli&s;h'd than that of his immediate predece&s;&s;or, Hawes. His be&s;t pieces
are written in the allegorical manner, and are, his CROWNE of LAU|RELL, and
BOWGE OF COURT. But the genius of this author &s;eems little better qualify'd
for pic|ture&s;que, than for &s;atyrical poetry; in the former, he wants
invention, grace, and dignity; in the lat|ter, wit, and good manners.</P>

literature, were I here to omit the mention of two Scotti&s;h poets, who
flouri&s;h'd a|bout this time, Sir David Lynde&s;ay, and William Dunbar; the
former of which, in his DREAM, and other pieces, and the latter in his GOLDEN
TERCE, or SHIELD, and in THE THISTLE AND ROSE, has di&s;cover'd a genuine

done, in one volume, and to have prefix'd this INDUC|TION as a general preface

<P>Not many years before the FAERIE QUEENE was written, viz. 1548,
Gelli publi&s;hed his Circe, which is declar'd in the Preface to be founded
upon the Dia|logue of Plutarch, mention'd by Mr. Jortin. Circe &s;oon became a
very popular book, and was tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h (as likewi&s;e into
other languages) in the Year 1557, by one Henry Iden; &s;o that, probably,
Spen&s;er had red it; and might be induc'd to con&s;ult that Dialogue, from its

harmonious with|out a full pau&s;e after the third foot. Thus,

<P>As the name of G. GASCOINE has been frequently mention'd
in the cour&s;e of this work, it may not be, perhaps, improper to give the
reader &s;ome further knowledge of him. His works were print|ed An. 1576, with
this title, 
<Q REND="inline">"A hundreth &s;undrie flowres, bounde up
in one &s;mall poe&s;ie; gather'd, partly by tran&s;lation, in the fyne and

partely by invention, out of our own fruitefull orchardes in Englande; yielding
&s;undrie &s;weet &s;avours of tragi|call, comicall, and morall di&s;cour&s;es,
both plea&s;aunt and profita|ble to the well-&s;mellyng no&s;es of learned
readers."</Q> This was follow'd by another edition, An. 1587. This author was
well e&s;teem'd by his cotemporary writers, as appears by their te&s;timo|nies
of him; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that he has much exceeded all the poets
of his age, in &s;moothne&s;s and harmony of ver&s;ification. Would it not
extend this note too far, as a &s;pecimen of his talent for love-ver&s;es, I
would produce his Ode, 
<Q REND="inline">"In prai&s;e of Lady Bridges, now Ladie

&s;urpriz'd to di&s;cover a delicacy, rarely, if ever, to be found in that
early &s;tate of our poetry.</P> 
<P>But the reader will, probably, be &s;till more entertain'd
with &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in JOCASTA, a Tragedie, (before mention'd) written ten
years before the Poem ju&s;t quoted, and acted at Gray's Inn, 1566, in which he
will not only perceive the &s;trength and harmony, but likewi&s;e the poetical
&s;pirit of Spen&s;er, who did not publi&s;h any one of his pieces till
fourteen years afterwards. The &s;tory is taken, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure
tran&s;lated, from the PHOENISSAE of Euripides; it is written in blank ver&s;e,
with choru&s;&s;es (none of which are copied from tho&s;e in the PHOENISSAE);

<P>In the age of the poet, tape&s;try was the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable
furniture of halls and &s;tate-rooms; as it was when Milton wrote his Comus,
who mentions tape&s;try as a circum&s;tance of grandeur.

and propriety both expre&s;&s;ions and de&s;criptions mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
lo&s;e, when the ob|jects, or cu&s;toms, or manners, to which they allude, are

<P>He &s;eems here to have intended a &s;atirical &s;troke again&s;t
the Puritans, who were a prevailing party in the age of Queen Elizabeth; and,
indeed, our au|thor, from his profe&s;&s;ion, had &s;ome rea&s;on to declare
him&s;elf their enemy, as poetry was what they parti|cularly &s;tigmatiz'd, and
bitterly inveigh'd again&s;t. In the year 1579, one Stephen Go&s;&s;on wrote a
pamphlet, with this title, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Schoole of Abu&s;e, containing a plea&s;aunt

of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t ridiculous treati&s;e of this &s;ort was that
written many years afterwards by W. Prynne; as a &s;pecimen of which, I &s;hall

<P>This extravagant and ab&s;urd &s;pirit of puritanical
enthu&s;ia&s;m, proved at la&s;t, in its effects, as perni|cious to polite

country: while every &s;pecies of elegance was repre&s;ented, by the&s;e
au&s;tere and melancholy zealots, as damnable luxury, and every degree of
decent adoration, as popi&s;h idolatry. In &s;hort, it is not &s;ufficiently
con&s;ider'd, what a rapid and national progre&s;s we were, at that time,
making in knowledge, and how &s;udden a &s;top was put to it, by the inundation

<P>It may not, perhaps, be impertinent to remark here, that Milton,
who was inclin'd to puritani&s;m, had good rea&s;on to think, that the
publication of his Sam&s;on Agoni&s;tes, would be very offen&s;ive to his
brethren, who held poetry, and particularly that of the dramatic kind, in
&s;uch abhorrence. And, upon this account, it is probable, that, in order to
excu&s;e him|&s;elf for having engag'd in this pro&s;crib'd and forbid|den
&s;pecies of writing, he thought it expedient to pre|fix to his play a formal
DEFENCE OF TRAGEDY, in which he endeavours to prove, that &s;ome of the
grave&s;t writers did not &s;cruple to illu&s;trate their di&s;|cour&s;es from
the works of tragic poets, and that many of the wi&s;e&s;t philo&s;ophers, and

ground in all the Northern climate. Into this gar|den none but old men were

&s;ilence attended upon the black darkne&s;s.&mdash;But &s;weet &s;leep did not

expatiates.</P>

they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;leep with their eyes open. Neither dares he
&s;ay that the porter and traveller are yet taking a nap, but only that they
have a good mind to't. And after all, we find none but the good woman who had
lo&s;t her child (and &s;he indeed is fa&s;t) a&s;leep, unle&s;s the dogs may
likewi&s;e be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o, becau&s;e they had left off barking. And
the&s;e methinks were &s;carce worthy to be taken notice of in an heroic poem,
except we may believe that in the old time, or that in Greek, they bark
heroically."</Q> Our critic here unfortunately &s;ets on upon a
&s;up|po&s;ition ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, viz. that 
<Q REND="inline">"the poet is repre&s;enting all the world as
fa&s;t a&s;leep,"</Q> &s;o that every argument which he draws from this
&s;uppo&s;ition mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall to the ground. Apol|lonius u&s;hers
in his night-piece by telling us, 
<Q REND="inline">"night cover'd the earth with her
&s;hade,"</Q> and afterwards &s;elects &s;uch objects and circum&s;tances the
repo&s;e and tranquillity of which produce the mo&s;t &s;triking contra&s;t to,
and con&s;equently mo&s;t &s;trongly exaggerate the di&s;traction and
inquietude of Medea. Hence he tells us that the mariner was contemplating with
calm attention the con&s;tellations of Helice and Orion; or, that now it was
the time, according to Virgil's tran&s;lation, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>cum medio volvuntur &s;ydera
lap&s;u:</HI></Q> or that it was a &s;till, and con&s;equently a &s;ilent
night, that even the traveller and door-keeper (whom he &s;ingles out, as their
employment implies watching and wakefullne&s;s) were now about to fall
a&s;leep; that even the mother (whom we might expect to find awake) had now
forgot her dead babes in &s;lumber; that the dogs had cea&s;ed barking thro'
the city, a circum&s;tance highly natural and picture&s;que of a &s;till night;
that every &s;ound, &amp;c. but, that amid&s;t this &s;ituation of things Medea
could not &s;leep. But what can we expect from a critic who confe&s;&s;es
him&s;elf to be &s;truck with this choice repre&s;en|tation of the night in
Dryden's conque&s;t of Mexico? 
<Q> 
<L>All things are hu&s;ht, as Nature's &s;elf lay dead;</L> 
<L>The mountains &s;eem to nod their drow&s;y head:</L> 
<L>The little birds in dreams their &s;ongs repeat,</L> 
<L>And &s;leeping flowers beneath the night-dew &s;weat.</L> 
<L>Ev'n Lu&s;t and Envy &s;leep.&mdash;</L></Q></P> 
<P>The&s;e lines are no bad burle&s;que; but it is their
misfortune, that they are written without the lea&s;t intention of producing a
&s;mile. Nor are Mr. Rymer's &s;entiments upon them a wor&s;e &s;pecimen of
burle&s;que critici&s;m, which however are dictated with the mo&s;t &s;erious
and unaffected gravity.</P> 
<Q> 
<P>In this de&s;cription, four lines yield greater variety of
matter, and more choice thoughts than twice the number of any other language.
Here is &s;omething more fortunate than the bolde&s;t fancy has yet reached,
and &s;omething more ju&s;t, than the &s;evere&s;t rea&s;on has ob|&s;erved.
Here are the flights of Statius and Marino temper'd with a more di&s;cerning
judgment, and the judgment of Virgil and Ta&s;&s;o animated with a more
&s;prightly wit. Nothing has been &s;aid &s;o ex|pre&s;&s;ive and &s;o home in
any other language as the fir&s;t ver&s;e in this de&s;cription. The &s;econd
is Statius improv'd. 
<Q> 
<L><HI>Et &s;imulant fe&s;&s;os curvata cacumina
&s;omnos,</HI></L></Q></P> 
<P>Saith Statius, where <HI>&s;imulant</HI> is a bold word in
compari&s;on of our Engli&s;h word <HI>&s;eem,</HI> being of an active
&s;ignification; and <HI>ca|cumina</HI> may as well be taken for the tops of
Trees, as the tops of Mountains, which doubtful meaning does not &s;o well
content the reader, as the certainty.</P> 
<P>In the third ver&s;e, 'tis not &s;aid that the birds &s;leep,
but what is more new, and more poetical, their &s;leep is imply'd, by their
dreams. Somewhat like to the fourth we have in Marino.</P> 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;<HI>E languidetti i fiori</HI></L> 
<L><HI>Giaceano a l'herba genitrice in &s;eno.</HI></L> 
<BIBL>Adonis, Cant. 20.</BIBL></Q> 
<P>Which is a pretty image, but has not &s;o near a re&s;emblance
with truth, nor can &s;o generally be apply'd to all flowers. Our author here
dares not &s;ay directly that the flowers &s;leep, which might &s;ound a little
har&s;h, but &s;lurs it over in the <HI>participle,</HI> as taken for granted,
and affirms only that they &s;weat, which the night-dew makes very ea&s;ie.</P>

<P>In the la&s;t half-ver&s;e, we may &s;ee how far our author
has out|done Apollonius. 'Twas no &s;uch &s;trange thing in the &s;orrowful
woman when &s;he had &s;pent her tears, for &s;leep to clo&s;e her eyes: but
here we have the mo&s;t raging and watchful pa&s;&s;ions lu&s;t and envy. And
the&s;e too in&s;tead of the lu&s;tful and the envious, for the greater force
and empha&s;is, in the ab&s;tract.</P> 
<P>Some may object, That the third ver&s;e does contradict the
fir&s;t. How can all things be hu&s;h'd, if birds in dreams repeat their
&s;ongs? Is not this like the indi&s;cretion of Marino? who &s;ays, That the
winds and all things are hu&s;ht, and the &s;eas &s;o fa&s;t a&s;leep, that
they &s;nore. Cant. 20.</P> 
<P>It may be an&s;wer'd, That in this place 'tis not the poet
that &s;peaks, but another per&s;on; and that the poet here truly repre&s;ents
the nature of man, who&s;e fir&s;t thoughts break out in bold and more general
terms, which by the &s;econd thoughts are more correct and limited. As if one
&s;hould &s;ay, all things are &s;ilent, or a&s;leep how|ever; if there is any
noi&s;e, 'tis &s;till but the effect of &s;leep, as the dreams of birds,
&amp;c. This compari&s;on might be much further im|prov'd to our advantage, and
more ob&s;ervations made, which are left to the readers ingenuity.

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the clo&s;e of this work, it may not be perhaps im|proper to
&s;ubjoin an apology for the manner in which I have conducted it.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t it may be objected in general, that the&s;e
ob&s;ervations would have been rendered more u&s;eful and <PB N="310" REF="313"> convenient had they been printed together with Spen&s;er's text,
arrang'd in their re&s;pective places; at lea&s;t it may be urged that &s;uch a
plan would have prevented much unnece&s;&s;ary tran&s;cription. But I was
di&s;&s;uaded from &s;uch a procedure by two rea&s;ons; the fir&s;t is, The
ob&s;ervations, (the la&s;t &s;ection excepted) as they now &s;tand, reduced to
general heads, appear to be &s;o many di&s;tinct e&s;&s;ays on Spen&s;er; and
thus methodized, are intended to form a kind of &s;y&s;tematical critci&s;m on
the FAERIE QUEENE. The &s;econd is, that a formal edition of this poem with
notes, would have been impertinent, as &s;uch a work is at pre&s;ent expected
from the hands of two learned and ingenious critics.</P>
<P>As to particular ejections, too many, I am &s;en&s;i|ble, mu&s;t
occur; one of which will probably be, that I have been more diligent in
pointing out the faults than the beauties of this author. That I have been
deficient in encomiums on particular pa&s;&s;ages, did not proceed from a want
of perceiving or acknowledging beauties, but from a per&s;ua&s;ion, that
nothing is more ab&s;urd or u&s;ele&s;s than the panegyrical comments of
tho&s;e, who critici&s;e from the imagination, rather than from the judgement,
who exert their admiration in&s;tead of their rea&s;on, and di&s;cover more of
enthu&s;ia&s;m than di&s;cernment. And this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, (it will
however mo&s;t commonly) be the ca&s;e of tho&s;e, who undertake to point out
beauties; which, as they will naturally approve them&s;elves to the reader by
their own force, &s;o no rea&s;on can often be given why they plea&s;e. The
&s;ame cannot always be &s;aid of faults, which I have <PB N="311" REF="314">
frequently di&s;played without palliation;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See more
particularly Sect. 1.</NOTE> it being my chief aim, together with that of
particular illu&s;tration, to give an impartial e&s;timate of the merit of this
origi|nal genius.</P>
<P>I cannot take my final leave of the reader without acknowledging
that this ta&s;k has been peculiarly de|lightful to me; tho' the bu&s;ine&s;s
of critici&s;m is gene|rally laborious and dry, yet it has here more frequently
amu&s;ed than fatigu'd my attention, in it's exerci&s;es upon an author who
makes &s;uch perpetual and power|ful appeals to the fancy. The plea&s;ure which
Spen&s;er received in compo&s;ing the FAERIE QUEENE mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be
&s;hared by it's commentator; and the critic, on this occa&s;ion, may venture
to exclaim with the poet, 
<Q> 
<L>The waies thro' which my weary &s;teppes I guide</L> 
<L>In this DELIGHTFULL LAND OF FAERY,</L> 
<L>Are &s;o exceeding &s;pacious and wide,</L> 
<L>And &s;prinkled with &s;uch &s;weet varietie</L> 
<L>Of all that plea&s;ant is to ear or eye,</L> 
<L>That I nigh ravi&s;ht with rare thoughts delight,</L> 
<L>My tedious travel do forgett thereby,</L> 
<L>And when I gin to feel decay of might,</L> 
<L>It &s;trength to me &s;upplies, and cheares my dulled
&s;pright.</L>
