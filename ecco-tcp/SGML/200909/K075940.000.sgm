<P>NOtwith&s;tanding the following work, a few additions excepted, hath lain by the author at lea&s;t fifteen years, it is very far from being &s;o perfect, as he could have wi&s;hed: any new lights therefore, and information, he will be glad to receive, through the hands of
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
his book&s;eller. In many things he fears he may have pa&s;&s;ed wrong judgments; and in &s;ome points, he hath not had all the means of information, which he could have de&s;ired: for as he hath taken nothing upon tru&s;t, with regard to the characters of ma&s;ters, he &s;ome|times wanted the opportunity he wi&s;hed for, of con&s;ulting their works.</P>
<P>Since his work was printed, the author hath &s;een a <HI>Dictionary of en|gravers, ancient and modern, in three volumes, publi&s;hed by F. BASAN, engraver at Paris;</HI> which &s;eems to be accurate; and might in &s;ome points have been of &s;ervice to him. It contains a very numerous catalogue of engra|vers, the more eminent of whom only
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
are taken notice of in the following pages. Of modern prints the author hath purpo&s;ely &s;aid little; declining generally to give his opinion of living arti&s;ts.</P>
<P>He thought it nece&s;&s;ary to introduce his work by a few ob&s;ervations on the principles of painting, as far as tho&s;e principles can be applied to prints. As the&s;e ob&s;ervations are not always new, he hath endeavoured, at lea&s;t, to make them conci&s;e.</P>
<P>In his account of arti&s;ts he hath paid &s;ome attention to chronology; but has, in many ca&s;es, purpo&s;ely neglected it, with a view of bringing tho&s;e ma&s;ters toge|ther, who&s;e manners are alike.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5">The chapter containing critici&s;ms on particular prints, is an addition to his original plan. He was advi&s;ed to in|&s;ert &s;omething of this kind, as an illu|&s;tration of his principles.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER I.</HI> The principles of Painting con&s;idered, &s;o far as they relate to Prints.</HEAD>
<P>A Painting, or picture, is di|&s;tingui&s;hed from a print only by the colouring, and the manner of execution. In other re&s;pects, the
<PB N="2" REF="12">
foundation of beauty is the &s;ame in both; and we con&s;ider a print, as we do a picture, in a double light, with regard to a <HI>whole,</HI> and with regard to its <HI>parts.</HI> It may have an agree|able effect as a <HI>whole,</HI> and yet be very culpable in its <HI>parts.</HI> It may be likewi&s;e the rever&s;e. A man may make a good appearance upon the <HI>whole;</HI> tho' his <HI>limbs,</HI> examined &s;e|parately, may be wanting in exact proportion. His <HI>limbs,</HI> on the other hand, may be exactly formed, and yet his <HI>per&s;on,</HI> upon the <HI>whole,</HI> di&s;|gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>To make a print agreeable as a <HI>whole,</HI> a ju&s;t ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e rules is nece&s;&s;ary, which relate to <HI>de&s;ign, di&s;po&s;ition, keeping,</HI> and the <HI>di&s;tribu|tion
<PB N="3" REF="13">
of light:</HI> to make it agreeable in its <HI>parts,</HI> of tho&s;e which relate to <HI>drawing, expre&s;&s;ion, grace,</HI> and <HI>per|&s;pective.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> (a term, which painters &s;ometimes u&s;e in a more limited &s;en&s;e) I mean the general conduct of the piece as a repre&s;entation of &s;uch a particular &s;tory. It an&s;wers, in an hi&s;torical relation of a fact, to a ju|dicious choice of circum&s;tances, and includes a <HI>proper time, proper charac|ters,</HI> the <HI>mo&s;t affecting manner of in|troducing tho&s;e characters,</HI> and <HI>proper appendages.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to a <HI>proper time,</HI> the painter is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by good old dra|matic
<PB N="4" REF="14">
rules; which inform him, that <HI>one</HI> point of time only &s;hould be taken &mdash; the mo&s;t affecting in the action; and that no other part of the &s;tory &s;hould interfere with it. Thus <HI>in the death of</HI> ANANIAS, if the in&s;tant of his falling down be cho|&s;en, no anachroni&s;m &s;hould be intro|duced; every part of the piece &s;hould corre&s;pond; each character &s;hould be under the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of a&s;toni&s;hment, and horror; tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions being yet unallayed by any cooler pa&s;&s;ions &s;ucceding.</P>
<P>With regard to <HI>characters,</HI> the painter mu&s;t &s;uit them to his <HI>piece</HI> by attending to hi&s;torical truth, if his &s;ubject be hi&s;tory; or to heathen mythology, if it be fabulous.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="15">He mu&s;t farther <HI>introduce them pro|perly.</HI> They &s;hould be ordered in &s;uch an advantageous manner, that the principal figures, tho&s;e which are mo&s;t concerned in the action, &s;hould catch the eye <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and en|gage it <HI>mo&s;t.</HI> This is an e&s;&s;ential ingredient in a well-told &s;tory. In the fir&s;t place, they &s;hould be the lea&s;t embarra&s;&s;ed of the group. This alone gives them di&s;tinction. But they may be farther di&s;tingui&s;h|ed, &s;ometimes by a <HI>broad light;</HI> &s;ome|times, tho' but rarely, and when the &s;ubject requires it, by a <HI>&s;trong &s;ha|dow,</HI> in the mid&s;t of a light; &s;ome|times by a remarkable <HI>action,</HI> or <HI>ex|pre&s;&s;ion;</HI> and &s;ometimes by a combi|nation of two or three of the&s;e modes of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="16">The la&s;t thing included in <HI>de&s;ign</HI> is the u&s;e of <HI>proper appendages.</HI> By <HI>appendages</HI> are meant animals, land|&s;kip, buildings, and in general, what ever is introduced into the piece by way of ornament. Every thing of this kind &s;hould corre&s;pond with the &s;ubject, and rank in a proper &s;ubor|dination to it. BASSAN would &s;ome|times paint a &s;cripture-&s;tory; and his method was, to croud his fore|ground with cattle, well painted in|deed, but wholly foreign to his &s;ub|ject; while you &s;eek for his princi|pal figures, and at length perhaps with difficulty find them in &s;ome re|mote corner of his picture. We often &s;ee a land&s;kip well adorned with a &s;tory in miniature. The <HI>land|&s;kip</HI> here is principal; but at the
<PB N="7" REF="17">
&s;ame time the figures, which tell the &s;tory, tho' &s;ubordinate to the land|&s;kip, are the <HI>principal figures.</HI> BAS|SAN'S practice was different. In his pictures neither the <HI>land&s;kip,</HI> nor the <HI>&s;tory</HI> is principal. His cattle are the ornament of his pieces. To intro|duce a &s;tory then is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>When all the&s;e rules are ob&s;erved, when a proper point of time is cho&s;en; when characters corre&s;ponding with the &s;ubject are introduced, and the&s;e ordered &s;o judiciou&s;ly as to point out the &s;tory in the &s;tronge&s;t manner; and la&s;tly, when all the appendages, and under-parts of the piece are &s;uitable, and &s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;ub|ject, then the &s;tory is well told, and of cour&s;e the de&s;ign is perfect.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="18">The &s;econd thing to be con&s;idered with regard to a <HI>whole,</HI> is <HI>di&s;po&s;ition.</HI> By this word is meant the art of grouping the figures, and of combi|ning the &s;everal parts of a picture. <HI>De&s;ign</HI> con&s;iders how each part, <HI>&s;eparately taken,</HI> concurs in produ|cing a <HI>whole</HI>&mdash;a <HI>whole,</HI> ari&s;ing from the <HI>unity of the &s;ubject,</HI> not the <HI>effect of the object.</HI> For the figures in a piece may be &s;o ordered, as to tell the &s;tory in an affecting manner, which is as far as <HI>de&s;ign</HI> goes, and yet may want that agreable <HI>com|bination,</HI> which is nece&s;&s;ary to plea&s;e the eye. To produce &s;uch a com|bination is the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>di&s;po&s;ition.</HI> In the cartoon of St. PAUL <HI>preaching at Athens,</HI> the <HI>de&s;ign</HI> is perfect; and
<PB N="9" REF="19">
the characters, in particular, are &s;o ordered, as to tell the &s;tory in a very affecting manner: yet the &s;everal parts of the picture are far from being agreably combined. If RUBENS had had the <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of the materials of this picture, and the management of the lights, it's effect as a <HI>whole</HI> had been very different.</P>
<P>Having thus di&s;tingui&s;hed between <HI>de&s;ign</HI> and <HI>di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> I &s;hall explain the latter a little farther.</P>
<P>It is an obvious principle, that one object at a time is enough to en|gage either the &s;en&s;es or the intellect. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>unity</HI> or a <HI>whole</HI> in painting. The eye, upon a complex view, mu&s;t be able to
<PB N="10" REF="20">
comprehend the picture as <HI>one ob|ject,</HI> or it cannot be &s;atisfyed. It may be plea&s;ed indeed by feeding on the parts &s;eparately; but a picture, which can plea&s;e no otherwi&s;e; is as poor a production, as a machine, the &s;prings and wheels of which are fi|ni&s;hed with nicety, but are unable to act in concert, and effect the intended movement.</P>
<P>Now <HI>di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> or the art of group|ing and combining the figures, and &s;everal parts of a picture is an e&s;&s;en|tial, which contributes greatly to pro|duce a <HI>whole</HI> in painting. When the parts are &s;cattered, they have no de|pendance on each other; they are &s;till only parts: but by an agreeable
<PB N="11" REF="21">
grouping, they are ma&s;&s;ed together, and become a <HI>whole.</HI></P>
<P>In di&s;po&s;ing figures great artifice is nece&s;&s;ary to make each group open it&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;et off advantageou&s;ly the &s;everal figures, of which it is compo&s;ed. The <HI>action</HI> at lea&s;t of each figure &s;hould appear.</P>
<P>No group can be agreeable with|out <HI>contra&s;t.</HI> By <HI>contra&s;t</HI> is meant the oppo&s;ition of one part to another. A &s;amene&s;s in attitude, action, or expre&s;&s;ion, among figures in the &s;ame group, will always di&s;gu&s;t the eye. In the cartoon of St. PAUL <HI>preaching at Athens,</HI> the contra&s;t among the figures is incomparably fine; and the
<PB N="12" REF="22">
want of it, <HI>in the death of</HI> ANANIAS, makes the group of the apo&s;tles a di&s;agreeable one.</P>
<P>Nor indeeed is <HI>contra&s;t</HI> required only among the <HI>figures</HI> of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> group, but al&s;o among the <HI>groups them&s;elves,</HI> and among <HI>all the parts,</HI> of which the piece is compo&s;ed. In the <HI>beautiful gate of the temple,</HI> the figures of the principal group are very well contra&s;ted; but the ad|joining group is di&s;po&s;ed almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner; which, together with the formal pillars, introduce a di&s;agreable regularity into the pic|ture.</P>
<P>The judicious painter, however, whether he group, combine, or con|tra&s;t,
<PB N="13" REF="23">
will always avoid the <HI>appear|ance</HI> of <HI>artifice.</HI> The &s;everal parts of his picture will be &s;o &s;uited to each other, that his art will &s;eem the re&s;ult of chance. In the <HI>&s;acrifice at Ly&s;tra,</HI> the head of the ox is bowed down, with a de&s;ign, no doubt, to group the figures around it more harmoniou&s;ly; but their action is &s;o well &s;uited to the po&s;ture of the ox, and the whole managed with &s;o much 'judgment, that altho' the fi|gures are di&s;po&s;ed with the utmo&s;t art, they appear with all the ea&s;e of nature. The remaining part of the group is an in&s;tance of the rever&s;e, in which a number of heads appear manife&s;tly &s;tuck in to fill up vacui|ties.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="24">But farther, as a <HI>whole,</HI> or <HI>unity,</HI> is an e&s;&s;ential of beauty, <HI>that di&s;po|&s;ition</HI> is certainly the mo&s;t perfect, which admits but of <HI>one</HI> group. All &s;ubjects, however, will not allow this <HI>clo&s;e</HI> ob&s;ervance of unity. When this is the ca&s;e, the &s;everal groups mu&s;t again be combined, chiefly by a proper di&s;tribution of light, &s;o as con&s;titute a <HI>whole.</HI></P>
<P>But as the <HI>whole</HI> will &s;oon be lo&s;t, if the con&s;tituent <HI>parts</HI> become <HI>nume|rous,</HI> it follows, that <HI>many</HI> groups mu&s;t not be admitted. Judicious painters have thought <HI>three</HI> the ut|mo&s;t number, that can be allowed. Some &s;ubjects indeed, as battles, and triumphs, nece&s;&s;arily require a great number of figures, and of cour&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="25">
various combinations of groups. In the management of <HI>&s;uch</HI> &s;ubjects, the greate&s;t art is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve a <HI>whole.</HI> Confu&s;ion in the figures mu&s;t be expre&s;&s;ed without confu&s;ion in the picture. A writer &s;hould treat his &s;ubject <HI>clearly,</HI> tho' he write upon <HI>ob&s;curity.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to <HI>di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> I &s;hall only add, that the <HI>&s;hape</HI> or <HI>form</HI> of the group &s;hould al&s;o be con&s;idered. The <HI>triangular</HI> form MICHAEL ANGELO thought the mo&s;t beautiful. And indeed there is a lightne&s;s in it, which no other form can receive. The group of the apo&s;tles, in the cartoon of <HI>giving the keys,</HI> and the &s;ame group, in the <HI>death of Ananias,</HI> are both ex|ceedingly heavy, and this heavine&s;s
<PB N="16" REF="26">
ari&s;es from nothing more than from the form of a parallelogram, within the lines of which the&s;e groups are contained. The triangular form too is capable of the mo&s;t variety: for the vertical angle of a group &s;o di&s;|po&s;ed may either be acute, or obtu&s;e, in any degree. Or a <HI>&s;egment</HI> only of a triangle may be taken, which &s;till increa&s;es the variety. The cartoons afford few in&s;tances of beauty in the <HI>forms</HI> of <HI>groups.</HI> In the works of Salvator Ro&s;a we frequently find them.</P>
<P>The painter, when he hath cho&s;en his &s;ubject, &s;hould always &s;cetch out &s;ome beautiful form of grouping, which may be&s;t &s;uit it; within which bounds he &s;hould, as nearly as may
<PB N="17" REF="27">
be, without affectation, confine his figures. What I mean, is, that the <HI>form</HI> of the group &s;hould never be left at random.</P>
<P>A third thing to be con&s;idered in a picture, with regard to a <HI>whole,</HI> is <HI>keeping.</HI> This word implies the dif|ferent degrees of &s;trength and faint|ne&s;s, which objects receive from near|ne&s;s and di&s;tance. A nice ob&s;ervance of the gradual fading of light and &s;hade contributes greatly towards the production of a <HI>whole.</HI> Without it, the di&s;tant parts, in&s;tead of being connected with the objects at hand, appear like foreign objects, wildly in|troduced, and unconnected. Dimi|ni&s;hed in <HI>&s;ize</HI> only, they put you in
<PB N="18" REF="28">
mind of Lilliput and Brobdignag uni|ted in one &s;cene. <HI>Keeping</HI> is generally found in great perfection in DELLA BELLA'S prints; and the want of it as con&s;picuou&s;ly in TEMPESTA'S.</P>
<P>Nearly allied to <HI>keeping</HI> is the doc|trine of <HI>harmony,</HI> which equally con|tributes towards the production of a <HI>whole.</HI> In <HI>painting,</HI> the practice of this doctrine has amazing force. A judicious arrangement of according tints will &s;trike even the unpracticed eye. The <HI>effect</HI> of every picture, in a great mea&s;ure, depends on one principal and ma&s;ter-tint, which pre|vails over the whole. Sometimes the purple tint is cho&s;en: &s;ometimes the mellow, brown one; and in &s;ome &s;ubjects the greeni&s;h hue is mo&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="29">
proper. Of this ruling tint, whatever it is, every object in the picture &s;hould in a degree participate. This theory is founded on principles of truth, and produces a fine effect from the <HI>harmony,</HI> in which it unites every object.&mdash;But altho' <HI>harmony</HI> &s;hews its effect chiefly in <HI>painting,</HI> yet in &s;ome mea&s;ure the effect of <HI>prints</HI> may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by it. Unle&s;s they are har|monized by the &s;ame <HI>tone of &s;hadow,</HI> if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, there will always appear a great deficiency in them. By the &s;ame <HI>tone of &s;hadow,</HI> I mean not only the <HI>&s;ame manner</HI> of execution, but an <HI>uniform</HI> degree of &s;trength. We often meet with hard touches in a print, which, &s;tanding alone, are unharmonious; but when every contiguous part is touched up
<PB N="20" REF="30">
to that <HI>tone,</HI> the <HI>whole</HI> is in uni&s;on. &mdash;<HI>Keeping</HI> then proportions a proper degree of &s;trength to the near and di&s;tant parts, in re&s;pect to <HI>each other. Harmony</HI> goes a &s;tep farther, and keeps each part quiet, with re&s;pect to it&s;elf, and the <HI>whole.</HI> I &s;hall only add, that in &s;cetches, and rough etchings no <HI>harmony</HI> is expected: it is enough, if <HI>keeping</HI> be ob&s;erved. <HI>Harmony</HI> is looked for only in fini&s;hed compo&s;itions.

in the colouring may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;upply its place in painting; but a print has no &s;uccidaneum.

<P>The general rule, which regards the di&s;tribution of <HI>light,</HI> is, that it &s;hould be &s;pread in <HI>large ma&s;&s;es.</HI> This gives us the idea of a <HI>whole.</HI> Every grand object catches the light only upon one large &s;urface. Where the light is &s;potted, we have the idea of &s;everal objects; or at lea&s;t of an in|coherent

one, if the object be &s;ingle; which the eye &s;urveys with difficulty. It is thus in painting. When we &s;ee, upon a <HI>comprehen&s;ive</HI> view, <HI>large ma&s;&s;es</HI> of light and &s;hade, we have, of cour&s;e, the idea of a <HI>whole</HI> &mdash; of <HI>unity</HI> in that picture. But where the light is &s;cattered, we have the idea of &s;everal objects, or at lea&s;t of one broken and confu&s;ed. TITIAN'S known illu&s;tration of this point by a bunch of grapes is beautiful, and explanatory. When the light falls upon the <HI>whole bunch</HI> together (one &s;ide being illumined, and the other dark) we have the repre&s;entation of tho&s;e large ma&s;&s;es, which con&s;titute a <HI>whole.</HI> But when the grapes are &s;tripped from the bunch, and &s;cat|tered upon a table (the light &s;hining

<P>To this &s;ummary of the rules, which relate to the <HI>whole</HI> of a picture, and to its <HI>parts,</HI> I &s;hall ju&s;t add a few ob&s;ervations upon <HI>execution;</HI> which relates equally to both.</P>
<P>By <HI>execution</HI> is meant that manner of working, by which each arti&s;t produces his effect. Arti&s;ts may dif|fer in their <HI>execution</HI> or <HI>manner,</HI> and yet all excel. CALLOT, for in&s;tance, u&s;es a &s;trong, firm &s;troke; SALVA|TOR, a &s;light, and loo&s;e one; while REMBRANDT executes in a manner different from them both, by &s;cratches &s;eemingly at random.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="42">Every arti&s;t is in &s;ome degree a <HI>manneri&s;t;</HI> that is, he executes in a <HI>manner</HI> peculiar to him&s;elf. But the word <HI>manneri&s;t</HI> has generally a clo&s;er &s;en&s;e. Nature &s;hould be the &s;tand|ard of imitation; and every object &s;hould be executed, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, in <HI>her manner.</HI> Thus SAL|VATOR'S figures, DU JARDIN'S ani|mals, and WATERLO'S land&s;kips, are all &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the cha|racter of nature. Other ma&s;ters again, deviating from this &s;tandard, in&s;tead of nature, have recour&s;e only to their own ideas. They have gotten a general idea of a man, a hor&s;e, or a tree; and to the&s;e ideas they apply upon all occa&s;ions. In|&s;tead therefore of repre&s;enting that endle&s;s variety, which nature exhi|bits
<PB REF="43">

<PB N="33" REF="44">
on every &s;ubject, a &s;amene&s;s runs through all their performances. Every figure, and every tree bears the &s;ame &s;tamp. Such arti&s;ts are <HI>properly</HI> called <HI>manneri&s;ts.</HI> TEMPEST, CALLOT, and TESTA are all <HI>manneri&s;ts</HI> of this kind. Their ideas are plainly no copies from nature. PERELLE'S land&s;kips too are mere tran&s;cripts of imagina|tion. &mdash; The arti&s;t however, who copies nature, if he make a bad choice (as REMBRANDT often did) is le&s;s agreable, than the <HI>manneri&s;t,</HI> who gives us his own elevated ideas, touched with &s;pirit and character, tho' not with exact truth. He is the true arti&s;t, who copies nature; but, where he finds her mean, elevates her from his own ideas of beauty. Such was SALVATOR.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="45">By the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and <HI>freedom</HI> of <HI>execution,</HI> we mean &s;omething, which it is diffi|cult to explain. A certain heavine&s;s always follows, when the arti&s;t is not &s;ure of his &s;troke, and cannot execute his idea with preci&s;ion. The rever&s;e is the ca&s;e, when he is certain of it, and gives it boldly. I know not how to explain better what is meant by <HI>&s;pirit.</HI> Mere <HI>freedom</HI> a quick execution will give; but unle&s;s that <HI>freedom</HI> be attended with preci&s;ion, the &s;troke, however free, will be &s;o un|meaning as to lo&s;e its effect.</P>
<P>To the&s;e ob&s;ervations, it may not be improper to add a &s;hort compa|rative view of the <HI>peculiar</HI> excellences of pictures, and prints, which will
<PB REF="46">

<PB N="35" REF="47">
&s;hew us in what points the picture has the advantage.</P>
<P>In <HI>de&s;ign</HI> and <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> the effects of both are equal. The print exhi|bits them with as much force and meaning as the picture.</P>
<P>In <HI>keeping</HI> the picture has the ad|vantage. The <HI>hazine&s;s</HI> of di&s;tance can|not well be expre&s;&s;ed by any thing, but the <HI>hue of nature,</HI> which the pencil is very able to give. The print <HI>endeavours</HI> to pre&s;erve this hazi|ne&s;s; and to give the idea: but the idea is very imperfect. It is little more than an aid to memory. We know the appearance exi&s;ts in nature; and the print furni&s;hes an hint to re|collect it.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="48">In the <HI>di&s;tribution of light</HI> the com|pari&s;on runs very wide. Here the painter avails him&s;elf of a thou&s;and varied tints, which a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this bu&s;ine&s;s; and by which he can har|monize his gradations from light to &s;hade with an almo&s;t infinite variety. An harmonious colouring has in it&s;elf indeed the effect of a proper di&s;tri|bution of light. The engraver, in the mean time, is left to work out his effect with two materials only, plain white and black.&mdash;In the print however you can more ea&s;ily trace the <HI>principles</HI> of light and &s;hade. The pencil is the implement of deception; and it requires the eye of a ma&s;ter to di&s;tingui&s;h between the effect of light, and the mere effect of colour: but in the print, even the unpracti&s;ed
<PB N="37" REF="49">
eye can readily catch the ma&s;s; and follow the di&s;tribution of it through all its variety of middle tints. &mdash; One thing more may be added on this head: If the picture have no harmony in its colouring, the tints being all at di&s;cord among them&s;elves, which is very often the ca&s;e in the works of reputable painters, a good print from &s;uch a picture, is more beautiful than the picture it&s;elf. It pre&s;erves what is valuable, (upon a &s;uppo&s;ition there is any thing valuable in it,) and removes what is offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>Thus the compari&s;on runs with regard to tho&s;e e&s;&s;entials, which re|late to a <HI>whole:</HI> with regard to <HI>drawing, expre&s;&s;ion, grace,</HI> and <HI>per|&s;pective,</HI> we can pur&s;ue it only in the
<PB N="38" REF="50">
two former: in the two latter, the picture and the print &s;eem to have equal advantages. &mdash; With regard to <HI>per&s;pective</HI> indeed, the lines of the print verging all to one point, may mark the <HI>principles</HI> of it more &s;trong|ly.</P>
<P><HI>Drawing,</HI> in a <HI>picture,</HI> is effected by the contiguity of two different colours: in a <HI>print</HI> by a po&s;itive line. In the <HI>picture,</HI> therefore, <HI>drawing</HI> has more of nature in it, and more of effect: but the &s;tudent in anatomy finds more preci&s;ion in the print; and can more ea&s;ily trace the line, and follow it in all its windings through light and &s;hade. &mdash; In met|zotinto indeed the compari&s;on fails; in which &s;pecies of prints, drawing
<PB N="39" REF="51">
is effected nearly as it is in paint|ing.</P>
<P>With regard to <HI>expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> the painter glories in his many advantages. The pa&s;&s;ions receive their force almo&s;t as much from <HI>colour,</HI> as from the emo|tion of feature. Nay lines, without colour, have frequently an effect very oppo&s;ite to what is intended. Vio|lent expre&s;&s;ions, when lineal only, become often grote&s;que. The com|plexion &s;hould &s;upport the di&s;tortion. The bloated eyes of immoderate grief degenerate into coar&s;e features, unle&s;s the pencil add tho&s;e high-blown touches, which mark the pa&s;&s;ion. A&s;k the engraver, why he could not give the dying &s;aint of DOMINICHINO
<PB N="40" REF="52">
his true expre&s;&s;ion?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JAC FREII'S copy of DOMINICHINO'S St. <HI>Jerome.</HI></NOTE> Why he gave him that gha&s;tly horror, in&s;tead of the &s;erene langour of the original? The engraver may with ju&s;tice &s;ay, he went as far as lines could go; but he wanted DOMINICHINO'S pen|cil to give tho&s;e pallid touches, which alone could make his lines expre&s;|&s;ive. &mdash; Age al&s;o, and &s;ex, the bloom of youth, and the wan cheek of &s;ickne&s;s, are equally indebted, in repre&s;entation, for their mo&s;t charac|teri&s;tic marks, to the pencil. &mdash; In <HI>portrait,</HI> the different hues of hair, and complexion; &mdash; in <HI>animal-life</HI> the various dies of furrs, and plu|mage
<PB N="41" REF="53">
&mdash; in <HI>land&s;kip,</HI> the peculiar tints of &s;ea&s;ons; of morning, and evening; the light azure of a &s;ummer's &s;ky; the &s;ultry glow of noon; the blui&s;h, or purple tinge, which the moun|tain a&s;&s;umes, as it recedes, or ap|proaches; the grey mo&s;s upon the ruin; the variegated greens, and mellow browns of foliage, and broken ground; in &s;hort, the colours of every part of nature, have all ama|zing force in &s;trengthning the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of objects. &mdash; In the room of all this, the deficient print has only to offer mere form, and the grada|tions of &s;imple light. Hence the &s;weet touches of the pencil of CLAUDE, mark his pictures with the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of nature, and render them invaluable; while
<PB N="42" REF="54">
his prints are the dirty &s;hapes of &s;omething, which he could not ex|pre&s;s.</P>
<P>The idea al&s;o of <HI>di&s;tant magnitude</HI> the print gives only very imperfectly. It is expre&s;&s;ed chiefly by colour. Air, which is naturally blue, is the me|dium, through which we &s;ee; and every object participates of this blue|ne&s;s. When the di&s;tance is &s;mall, the tinge is imperceptible: as it increa&s;es, the tinge grows &s;tronger; and when the object is very remote, it entirely lo&s;es its natural colour, and becomes blue. And indeed this is &s;o familiar a criterion of di&s;tance, at lea&s;t, with tho&s;e, who live in mountainous countries, that if the object be vi&s;ible at all, after it has
<PB N="43" REF="55">
received the full <HI>ether-tinge,</HI> if I may &s;o &s;peak, the &s;ight immediately judges it to be very large. The eye ranging over the plains of Egypt, and catching the blue point of a pyramid, from the colour concludes the di&s;tance; and is &s;truck with the magnitude of an object, which, through &s;uch a &s;pace, can exhibit form. &mdash;Here the print fails: this criterion of di&s;tant magnitude, it is unable to give.</P>
<P>The print equally fails, when the medium it&s;elf receives a foreign tinge from a &s;trength of colour behind it. The idea of horrour impre&s;&s;ed by an expan&s;e of air glowing, in the night, with di&s;tant fire, cannot be rai&s;ed by black and white. VANDERVELDE has
<PB N="45" REF="56">
contrived to give us a good idea of the dreadful glare of a fleet in flames: but it were ridiculous for an engraver to attempt &s;uch a &s;ub|ject; becau&s;e he cannot expre&s;s that idea, which principally illu&s;trates his &s;tory.</P>
<P><HI>Tran&s;parency</HI> is another thing which the print is very unable to expre&s;s. It is the united tinge of two colours, one behind the other, each of which, in part, di&s;covers it&s;elf &s;ingly. If you employ one colour only, you have the idea of opaquene&s;s. A fine carnation is a white tran&s;parent &s;kin, &s;pread over a multitude of &s;mall blood ve&s;&s;els, which blu&s;h through it. When the breath departs, the&s;e little fountains of life flow no longer; the
<PB N="46" REF="57">
bloom fades; and livid palene&s;s, the colour of death, &s;ucceeds. &mdash; The happy pencil can mark both the&s;e effects. It can &s;pread the glow of health over the cheek of beauty; and it can with equal facility expre&s;s the cold, wan tint of human clay. The print can expre&s;s neither; repre|&s;enting, in the &s;ame dry manner, the bright tran&s;parency of the one, and the inert opaquene&s;s of the other.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the print fails in the expre&s;|&s;ion of <HI>poli&s;hed bodies;</HI> which are in|debted for their chief lu&s;tre to <HI>reflected colours.</HI> The print indeed goes far|ther here, than in the ca&s;e of tran|&s;parency. In this it can do very
<PB N="46" REF="58">
little: in <HI>poli&s;hed bodies,</HI> it can at lea&s;t give <HI>reflected &s;hapes.</HI> It can &s;hew the <HI>forms</HI> of hanging woods upon the edges of the lake; tho' it is unable to give the kindred tinge. But in many ca&s;es the <HI>poli&s;hed</HI> body receives the <HI>tinge,</HI> without the <HI>&s;hape.</HI> Here the engraver is wholly deficient: he knows not how to &s;tain the gleaming &s;ilver with the purple liquor it con|tains; nor is he able to give the hero's armour its highe&s;t poli&s;h from the tinge of the crim&s;on ve&s;t, which covers it.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle word upon the &s;ubject of <HI>execution,</HI> &s;hall conclude the&s;e re|marks. Here the advantage lies wholly on the &s;ide of painting. <HI>That</HI> manner, which can be&s;t give the idea
<PB N="47" REF="59">
of the &s;urface of an object, is the be&s;t; and the lines of the fine&s;t engraving are har&s;h in compari&s;on of the &s;mooth flow of the pencil. <HI>Metzotinto,</HI> tho' deficient in &s;ome re&s;pects, is certainly in others the happye&s;t manner of ex|ecution; and the ancient <HI>wooden print,</HI> in which the middle tint is u&s;ed, is undoubtedly in point of execution, beyond either etching or engraving.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER II.</HI> Ob&s;ervations on the different Kinds of Prints.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are three kinds of prints, <HI>engravings, etchings,</HI> and <HI>met|zotintos.</HI> The characteri&s;tic of the fir&s;t is <HI>&s;trength;</HI> of the &s;econd <HI>free|dom;</HI> and of the third, <HI>&s;oftne&s;s.</HI> All

the&s;e however may in &s;ome degree be found in each.</P>
<P>From the &s;hape of the engraver's tool, each &s;troke is an angular inci|&s;ion; which form mu&s;t of cour&s;e give the line &s;trength, and firmne&s;s, if it be not very tender. From &s;uch a line al&s;o, as it is a deliberate one, correctne&s;s may be expected; but no great freedom: for it is a laboured line, ploughed through the metal, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, in a degree, want ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Unlimited <HI>freedom,</HI> on the other hand, is the characteri&s;tic of <HI>etching.</HI> The needle, gliding along the &s;ur|face of the copper, meets no re&s;i&s;t|ance, and ea&s;ily takes any turn, the

Etching in|deed is mere drawing; and may be practi&s;ed with the &s;ame facility. &mdash; But as <HI>aqua-fortis</HI> bites in an <HI>equable</HI> manner, it cannot give the lines that &s;trength, which they re|ceive from a pointed graver, cut|ting into the copper.

<P>As engraving therefore and etch|ing have their re&s;pective advantages, and deficiencies, arti&s;ts have endea|voured to unite their powers, and correct the faults of each, by join|ing the <HI>freedom</HI> of the one, with the <HI>&s;trength</HI> of the other. In mo&s;t of our modern prints, the plate is fir&s;t etched, and afterwards &s;trength|ened, and fini&s;hed by the engraver. And when this is <HI>well</HI> done, it has a happy effect. That flatne&s;s, which is the con&s;equence of an equable &s;trength of &s;hade, is taken off; and the print gains a new effect by the relief given to tho&s;e parts, which
<PB N="53" REF="64">
<HI>hang</HI> (in the painter's language) upon the parts behind to them. &mdash; But great art is nece&s;&s;ary in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s. We &s;ee many a print, which wanted only a <HI>few</HI> touches, when it appeared in its etched proof, re|ceive afterwards &s;o <HI>many,</HI> as to become laboured, heavy, and di&s;gu&s;tful.</P>
<P>It is a rare thing to meet with a print <HI>entirely engraved,</HI> which is free from &s;tiffne&s;s. A celebrated ma&s;ter of our own indeed hath found the art of giving freedom to the &s;troke of a graver; and hath di&s;played great force of execution upon works by no means worthy of him: as if he were determined to &s;hew the world he could &s;tamp a value upon any thing. &mdash; But &s;uch arti&s;ts are
<PB N="54" REF="65">
rarely found. <HI>Mere engravers,</HI> in general, are little better than <HI>mere mechanics.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>etching,</HI> we have a greater va|riety of excellent prints. The ca&s;e is, it is &s;o much the &s;ame as draw|ing, that we have the very works them&s;elves of the mo&s;t celebrated ma&s;ters; many of whom have left behind them prints in this way; which, however &s;light and incor|rect, will always have &s;omething <HI>ma&s;terly,</HI> and of cour&s;e <HI>beautiful</HI> in them.</P>
<P>In the mu&s;cling of human figures of any con&s;iderable &s;ize, <HI>engraving</HI> hath undoubtedly the advantage of <HI>etching.</HI> The &s;oft and delicate tran|&s;itions,
<PB N="55" REF="66">
from light to &s;hade, which are there required, cannot be &s;o well expre&s;&s;ed by the needle: and in general, <HI>large prints</HI> require a &s;trength, which <HI>etching</HI> cannot give, and are therefore fit objects of <HI>engraving.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Etching,</HI> on the other hand, is more particularly adapted to &s;cetches, and &s;light de&s;igns; which, if executed by an engraver, would entirely lo&s;e their freedom; and with it their beauty. Land&s;kip too, in general, is the object of <HI>etching.</HI> The foli|age of trees, ruins, &s;ky, and indeed every part of land&s;kip requires the utmo&s;t freedom. In fini&s;hing an <HI>etched</HI> land&s;kip with the <HI>tool</HI> (as it is called) too much care cannot be taken to prevent heavine&s;s. We re|marked
<PB N="56" REF="67">
before the nicety of touch|ing upon an etched plate; but in land&s;kip the bu&s;ine&s;s is peculiarly delicate. The fore-grounds may re|quire a few &s;trong touches, and the boles of &s;uch trees as are placed upon them; and here and there a few harmonizing &s;trokes will add to the effect; but if the engraver ven|tures much farther, he has good luck, if he do no mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>An <HI>engraved</HI> plate, unle&s;s it be cut very &s;lightly, will ca&s;t off five hundred good impre&s;&s;ions. An <HI>etched</HI> one will not give above two hun|dred; unle&s;s it be eaten very deep, and then it may perhaps give three hundred. After that, the plate mu&s;t
<PB REF="68">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="57" REF="69">
be retouched, or the impre&s;&s;ions will be faint.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the common method of en|graving on <HI>copper,</HI> we have prints en|graved on pewter, and on wood. The pewter plate gives a coar&s;ene&s;s and dirtine&s;s to the print, which is di&s;a|greable. But engraving upon wood is capable of great beauty. Of this &s;pecies of engraving more &s;hall el&s;e|where be &s;aid.</P>
<P>Metzotinto is very different from either <HI>engraving</HI> or <HI>etching.</HI> In the&s;e you make the <HI>&s;hades;</HI> in <HI>metzotinto,</HI> the <HI>lights.</HI></P>
<P>Since the time of its invention by
<PB N="58" REF="70">
Prince RUPERT, as is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, the art of &s;craping <HI>met|zotintos</HI> is greatly more improved than either of its &s;i&s;ter-arts. Some of the earlie&s;t <HI>etchings</HI> are perhaps the be&s;t; and <HI>engraving,</HI> &s;ince the times of GOLTZIUS and MULLER, hath not perhaps made any very great advances. But <HI>metzotinto,</HI> compared with its original &s;tate, is, at this day, almo&s;t a new art. If we exa|mine &s;ome of the modern pieces of workman&s;hip in this way, the <HI>Jewi&s;h Rabbi,</HI> the portrait of <HI>Mrs.</HI> LAS|CELLES, <HI>with a child on her knee,</HI> Mr. GARRICK <HI>between Tragedy and Comedy,</HI> and &s;everal other prints by &s;ome of our be&s;t metzotinto-&s;cra|pers, they almo&s;t as much exceed the works of WHITE and SMITH; as

<PB N="59" REF="73">
tho&s;e ma&s;ters did BECKET and SIMONS. As to Prince RUPERT'S works, I never &s;aw any, which were <HI>certainly</HI> known to be his; but I make no doubt they were executed in the &s;ame black, har&s;h, di&s;agreable man|ner, which appears &s;o &s;trong in the ma&s;ters, who &s;ucceeded. The inven|tion however was noble; and the early ma&s;ters have the credit of it: but the truth is, the ingenious me|chanic hath been called in to the painter's aid, and hath invented a manner of <HI>laying ground,</HI> wholly un|known to the earlier ma&s;ters: and they who are acquainted with <HI>met|zotinto,</HI> know the <HI>ground</HI> to be a very capital con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="74">The characteri&s;tic of <HI>metzotinto</HI> is <HI>&s;oftne&s;s,</HI> which adapts it chiefly to portrait, or hi&s;tory with a few fi|gures, and the&s;e not too &s;mall. No|thing, except paint, can expre&s;s fle&s;h more naturally, or the flowing of hair, or the folds of drapery, or the catching lights of armour. In en|graving and etching we mu&s;t get over the prejudices of cro&s;s lines, which exi&s;t on no natural bodies: but <HI>metzotinto</HI> gives us the &s;tronge&s;t re|pre&s;entation of a <HI>&s;urface.</HI> If how|ever the figures are two crowded, it wants &s;trength to detach the &s;eve|ral parts with a proper relief: and if they are very &s;mall, it wants pre|ci&s;ion, which can only be given by an outline; or, as in painting, by a different tint. The unevenne&s;s of the
<PB N="61" REF="75">
ground will occa&s;ion bad drawing, and aukwardne&s;s &mdash; in the extremi|ties e&s;pecially. Some inferior arti&s;ts have endeavoured to remedy this by terminating their figures with an engraved, or etched line: but they have tryed the experiment with bad &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;trength of the line, and the &s;oftne&s;s of the ground, accord ill together. I &s;peak not here of &s;uch a judicious mixture of <HI>etching</HI> and <HI>metzotinto,</HI> as WHITE formerly u&s;ed, and &s;uch as our be&s;t metzo|tinto-&s;crapers at pre&s;ent u&s;e, to give a &s;trength to particular parts; I &s;peak only of a har&s;h, and injudicious lineal termination.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="76"><HI>Metzotinto</HI> excells each of the other &s;pecies of prints in its capacity of receiving the mo&s;t beautiful effects of light and &s;hade: as it can the mo&s;t happily unite them by blend|ing them together. &mdash; Of this REM|BRANDT &s;eems to have been aware. He had probably &s;een &s;ome of the fir&s;t metzotintos; and admiring the effect, endeavoured to produce it in etching by a variety of inter&s;ecting &s;cratches.</P>
<P>You cannot well ca&s;t off more than an hundred good impre&s;&s;ions from a metzotinto plate. The rub|bing of the hand &s;oon wears it &s;mooth. And yet by con&s;tantly re|pairing it, it may be made to give
<PB N="63" REF="77">
four or five hundred with tolerable &s;trength. The fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions are not always the be&s;t. They are too black and har&s;h. You will com|monly have the be&s;t impre&s;&s;ions from the fiftieth to the &s;eventieth: the har&s;h edges will be &s;oftened down; and yet there will be &s;pirit and &s;trength enough left.</P>

<HEAD>MASTERS IN HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>ALBERT DURER, tho' not the inventor, was one of the fir&s;t improvers of the art of engraving. He was a German painter; and at the &s;ame time a Man of letters, and
<PB N="66" REF="79">
a philo&s;opher. It may be added in his prai&s;e, that he was an intimate friend of the great Era&s;mus; who revi&s;ed, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;ome of the pieces which he publi&s;hed. He was a man of bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o; and for many years was the leading magi&s;trate of Nuremburgh. &mdash; His prints, con&s;i|dered as the fir&s;t efforts of a new art, have great merit. Nay, we may add, that it is a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee a new art, in its fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, carried to &s;uch a length. In &s;ome of tho&s;e prints, which he executed on cop|per, the engraving is elegant to a great degree. His <HI>Hell-&s;cene</HI> parti|cularly, which was engraved in the year 1513, is as high-fini&s;hed a print as ever was engraved, and as hap|pily fini&s;hed. The labour he has
<PB N="67" REF="80">
be&s;towed upon it, has it's full effect. In his wooden prints too we are &s;ur|prized to &s;ee, in &s;o early a ma&s;ter, &s;o much meaning, and relief; the heads &s;o well marked; and every part &s;o well executed. &mdash; This arti&s;t &s;eems to have under&s;tood very well the principles of de&s;ign. His com|po&s;ition too is often plea&s;ing; and his drawing generally good: but he knows very little of the management of light; and &s;till le&s;s of grace: and yet his ideas are purer, and more elegant, than we could have &s;up|po&s;ed from the aukward archetypes, which his country and education af|forded. In a word, he was certainly a Man of a very exten&s;ive genius; and, as <HI>Va&s;ari</HI> remarks, would have been an extraordinary arti&s;t, if he
<PB N="68" REF="81">
had had an Italian, in&s;tead of a Ger|man education. His prints are very numerous. They were much admi|red in his own life-time, and eagerly bought up; which put his wife, who was a teizing woman, upon urging him to &s;pend more time upon en|graving, than he was inclined to do. He was very rich, and cho&s;e rather to practice his art as an amu&s;ement, than as a bu&s;ine&s;s. He died in the year 1527.</P>
<P>The immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and imi|tators of ALBERT DURER were LUCAS VAN LEIDEN, ALDGRAVE, PENS, HISBEN, and &s;ome others of le&s;s note. Their works are very much in their ma&s;ter's &s;tyle; and were the admiration of an age, which
<PB N="69" REF="82">
had &s;een nothing better. The be&s;t of ALDGRAVE'S works are two or three &s;mall pieces of the &s;tory of Lot.</P>
<P>GOLTZIUS flouri&s;hed a little after the death of the&s;e ma&s;ters; and car|ried engraving to a great height. He was a native of Germany, where he learned his art; but travelling afterwards into Italy, he there im|proved his ideas. You plainly di&s;|cover in him, a mixture of the Fle|mi&s;h and Italian &s;chools. His forms have &s;ometimes a degree of elegance in them; but, in general the Dutch ma&s;ter predominates. GOLTZIUS is often happy in <HI>de&s;ign</HI> and <HI>di&s;po&s;i|tion;</HI> and fails mo&s;t in the <HI>di&s;tribu|tion of light.</HI> But his chief excellence
<PB N="70" REF="83">
lies in <HI>execution.</HI> He engraves with a noble, firm, expre&s;&s;ive line, which hath &s;carce been excelled by any &s;ucceeding ma&s;ters. There is a va|riety too in his manner, which is very plea&s;ing. His print of <HI>the cir|cumci&s;ion</HI> is one of the be&s;t of his works. The &s;tory is well told, the groups agreably di&s;po&s;ed; and the execution admirable; but the figures are Dutch; and the whole, through the want of a proper di&s;tribution of &s;hade, is only a glaring ma&s;s.</P>
<P>MULLER ingraved very much in the &s;tyle of GOLTZIUS; and yet with a &s;till bolder, and firmer &s;troke. We have no where greater ma&s;ter|pieces in execution, than the works of this arti&s;t exhibit. The <HI>bapti&s;m
<PB N="71" REF="84">
of</HI> JOHN is perhaps the mo&s;t beauti|ful &s;pecimen of bold engraving, that is extant.</P>
<P>ABRAHAM BLOEMART was a Dutch ma&s;ter al&s;o, and contempo|rary with GOLTZIUS. We are not informed what particular means of improvement he had; but it is cer|tain he de&s;igned in a more elegant ta&s;te, than any of his countrymen. His figures are often graceful; ex|cepting only, that he gives them &s;ometimes an affected twi&s;t; which is &s;till more con&s;picuous in the fin|gers: an affectation which we &s;ometimes al&s;o find in the prints of GOLTZIUS. &mdash; The <HI>re&s;urrection of</HI> LAZARUS is one of BLOEMART'S ma&s;ter pieces; in which are many
<PB N="72" REF="85">
faults, and many beauties; both very characteric.</P>
<P>While the Dutch ma&s;ters were thus carrying the art of engraving to &s;o great an height, it was intro|duced into Italy by ANDREA MAN|TEGNA; to whom the Italians a&s;|cribe the invention of it. The paint|ings of this ma&s;ter, tho' they abound in noble pa&s;&s;ages, are formal and di&s;agreable. We have a &s;pecimen of them at Hampton-Court in the triumph of JULIUS CAESAR.&mdash;His prints, which are &s;aid to have been engraved on tin-plates, are tran&s;|&s;cripts from the &s;ame ideas. We &s;ee in them the cha&s;te, correct out|line, and noble &s;implicity of the Ro|man &s;chool: but we are to expect
<PB N="73" REF="86">
nothing more; not the lea&s;t attempt towards an agreable <HI>whole.</HI> &mdash; And indeed we &s;hall perhaps find in ge|neral, that the ma&s;ters of the Roman &s;chool were more &s;tudious of tho&s;e e&s;&s;entials of painting, which regard the <HI>parts;</HI> and the Flemi&s;h ma&s;ters of tho&s;e, which regard the <HI>whole.</HI> The former therefore drew better <HI>figures;</HI> the latter made better <HI>pic|tures.</HI></P>
<P>MANTEGNA was &s;ucceeded by PARMIGIANO and PALMA, both ma&s;ters of great reputation. PAR|MIGIANO having formed the mo&s;t accurate ta&s;te upon a thorough &s;tudy of the works of RAPHAEL and MICHAEL ANGELO, publi&s;hed many of his figures, rather than de&s;igns
<PB N="74" REF="87">
engraved on wood, which abounded with every kind of beauty; if we may form a judgment of them from the few which we &s;ometimes meet with. Whither PARMIGIANO in|vented the art of engraving upon wood, does not certainly appear. His pretentions to the invention of etching are le&s;s di&s;putable. In this way he publi&s;hed many &s;light pieces, which do him great credit. In the mid&s;t of his labours, he was inter|rupted by a knavi&s;h engraver, who pillaged him of all his plates. Una|ble to bear the lo&s;s, he fore&s;wore his art, and abandoned him&s;elf to chymi&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="88">PALMA was too much employed as a painter to have much lei&s;ure for etching. He hath left however &s;e|veral prints behind him, which are remarkable for the delicacy of the drawing, and the freedom of the execution. He etches in a very loo&s;e but ma&s;terly manner. His prints are &s;carce; and indeed we &s;eldom meet with any, that de&s;erve more than the name of &s;cetches.</P>
<P>FRANCIS PARIA &s;eems to have copied the manner of PALMA with great &s;ucce&s;s. But his prints are &s;till more &s;carce than his ma&s;ter's; nor have we a &s;ufficient number of them to enable us to form a judgment of his merit.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="89">But the great improver of the art of engraving upon wood, and who at once carried it to a degree of per|fection, which hath not &s;ince been exceeded was ANDREA ANDREANI of Mantua. The works of this ma|&s;ter are remarkable for the free|dom, &s;trength, and &s;pirit of the execution; the elegant correctne&s;s of the drawing; and in general for their effect. Few prints come &s;o near the idea of painting. They have a force, which a pointed tool upon copper cannot reach; and the wa&s;h, of which the middle tint is compo&s;ed, adds all the &s;oftne&s;s of drawing. The works of this ma&s;ter indeed are &s;eldom &s;een in perfection. They are &s;carce; and when we do meet with them, it is a chance if
<PB N="77" REF="90">
the impre&s;&s;ions be good: and very much of the beauty of the&s;e prints depends on the goodne&s;s of the im|pre&s;&s;ion. For often the outline is left hard, the middle tint being lo&s;t; and &s;ometimes the middle tint is left without it's proper termination.</P>
<P>Among the ancient Italian ma&s;ters, we cannot omit MARK ANTONIO, and AUGUSTIN of Venice. They are both celebrated; and have hand|ed down to us many engravings from the works of RAPHAEL: but their <HI>antiquity,</HI> not their <HI>merit,</HI> &s;eems to have recommended them. Their execution is har&s;h, and formal to the la&s;t degree; and if their prints give us any idea of the works of RAPHAEL, we may well wonder,
<PB N="78" REF="91">
as PICART ob&s;erves, how that ma&s;ter got his reputation.</P>
<P>FREDERIC BAROCCHI was born at Urbin, where the genius of RA|PHAEL in&s;pired him. In his early youth he travelled to Rome: and giving him&s;elf up to inten&s;e &s;tudy, he acquired a great name in paint|ing. At his lei&s;ure hours he etched a few prints from his own de&s;igns, which are highly fini&s;hed, and exe|cuted with great &s;oftne&s;s and deli|cacy. The <HI>Salutation</HI> is his capital performance; of which we &s;eldom meet with any impre&s;&s;ions, but tho&s;e taken from the retouched plate, which are very har&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="92">ANTHONY TEMPESTA was a na|tive of Florence, but re&s;ided chiefly at Rome; where he was much em|ployed as a painter by GREGORY XIII. &mdash; His prints are very numerous; all from his own de&s;igns. Battles and huntings are the &s;ubjects, in which he mo&s;t delighted. His merit lies in expre&s;&s;ion, and drawing; in the grandeur of his ideas, and an imagination exceedingly fertile. His figures are often elegant, and grace|ful; and his heads marked with un|common &s;pirit, and correctne&s;s. His hor&s;es, tho' fle&s;hy and ill-drawn, and evidently never copied from nature, are however noble animals; and di&s;|play an endle&s;s variety of beautiful ac|tions. &mdash; His imperfections, at the &s;ame time, are very glaring. His
<PB N="80" REF="93">
compo&s;ition is generally bad. Here and there you have a good group; &s;eldom an agreeable whole. He had not the art of pre&s;erving his back|grounds tender; &s;o that we are not to expect any effect of keeping. His execution is har&s;h; and he is totally ignorant of the di&s;tribution of light. &mdash; But notwith&s;tanding all his faults, &s;uch is his merit upon the whole, that, as &s;tudies at lea&s;t, his prints de&s;erve a much higher rank in the cabinets of connoi&s;&s;eurs, than they generally find.</P>
<P>AUGUSTIN CARRACHE has left a few etchings, which are admired for the delicacy of the drawing, and the freedom of the execution. But there is great flatne&s;s in them, and
<PB N="77" REF="94">
want of &s;trength. Etchings indeed in this &s;tyle are rather meant as &s;cetches, than fini&s;hed prints.</P>
<P>GUIDO'S etchings, mo&s;t of which are &s;mall, are e&s;teemed for the &s;im|plicity of the de&s;ign; the elegance and correctne&s;s of the outline; and that grace, for which this ma&s;ter is &s;o remarkable. The extremities of his figures are particularly touched with great accuracy. But we have the &s;ame &s;piritle&s;s flatne&s;s in the works of GUIDO, which we find in tho&s;e of his ma&s;ter CARRACHE, ac|companied at the &s;ame time with le&s;s freedom.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="95">CANTARINI copied the manner of GUIDO, as PARIA did that of PALMA; and &s;o happily, that it is often difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h the works of the&s;e two ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>CALLOT was little acquainted with any of the grand principles of paint|ing: of compo&s;ition, and the ma|nagement of light he was totally ig|norant. But tho' he could not make a picture, he was admirably &s;killed in drawing a figure. His attitudes are generally graceful, when they are not affected; his expre&s;&s;ion &s;trong; his drawing correct; and his execu|tion ma&s;terly, tho' rather laboured. His <HI>Fair</HI> is a good epitome of his works. Con&s;idered as a <HI>whole,</HI> it is a confu&s;ed jumble of ideas; but the
<PB N="79" REF="96">
<HI>parts,</HI> &s;eparately examined, appear the work of a ma&s;ter. The &s;ame character may be given of his mo&s;t famous work, the <HI>Mi&s;eries of war;</HI> in which there is more expre&s;&s;ion both in action and feature, than was ever perhaps &s;hewn in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s. And yet I know not whether his <HI>Beggars</HI> be not the more capital performance. In the <HI>Mi&s;eries of war,</HI> he aims at compo&s;ition, in which he rarely &s;ucceeds: <HI>His Beg|gars</HI> are detached figures, in which lay his &s;trength. &mdash; I &s;hall only add, that a vein of drollery and humour runs through all his de&s;igns; which &s;ometimes, when he chu&s;es to indulge it freely, as in the <HI>Temptation of St.</HI> ANTHONY, di&s;plays it&s;elf in a very facetious manner.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="97">COUNT GAUDE contracted a friend&s;hip at Rome with ADAM ELSHAMER, from who&s;e de&s;igns he engraved a few prints. GAUDE was a young nobleman upon his travels; and never practi&s;ed engraving as a profe&s;&s;ion. This would call for in|dulgence, if his prints had le&s;s merit; but in their way they are beautiful; tho' on the whole, formal, and un|plea&s;ant. They are highly fini&s;hed, but void of all freedom. Moon|lights, and torch-lights are the &s;ub|jects he chiefly chu&s;es; and his great excellence lies in pre&s;erving the effects of the&s;e different lights. His prints are generally &s;mall. I know only one, the <HI>Flight into Egypt,</HI> of a larger &s;ize.</P>
<P>SALVATOR ROSA <HI>painted</HI> land&s;kip more than hi&s;tory; but his <HI>prints</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="98">
are chiefly hi&s;torical. He was bred a painter; and perfectly under&s;tood his art; if we except only the <HI>ma|nagement of light,</HI> of which he &s;eems to have been ignorant. The capital land&s;kip of this ma&s;ter at Chi&s;wick is a noble picture. The contrivance, the compo&s;ition, the di&s;tances, the figures, and all the parts, and appen|dages of it are fine: but in point of light it might perhaps have been improved, if the middle ground, where the figures of the &s;econd di&s;tance &s;tand, had been thrown into &s;un|&s;hine. &mdash; In <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> and generally in <HI>compo&s;ition,</HI> SALVATOR is very great. His figures, which he drew in ex|qui&s;ite ta&s;te, are graceful, and nobly expre&s;&s;ive, beautifully grouped, and varied into the mo&s;t agreeable atti|tudes. With regard indeed to the
<PB N="82" REF="99">
legs of his figures, it mu&s;t be owned, he is a <HI>manneri&s;t.</HI> They are well drawn; but all ca&s;t in one mould. There is a &s;tiffne&s;s too in the backs of his extended hands: the palms are beautiful.

<P><PB N="83" REF="100">SALVATOR was a man of genius, and of learning; both which he has found frequent opportunities of di&s;|playing in his works.

<P>REMBRANDT'S excellency, as a painter, lay in colouring, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;uch perfection, that it almo&s;t &s;creens every fault in his pic|tures. His prints, deprived of this palliative, have only his inferior qua|lifications to recommend them. The&s;e are expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;kill in the ma|nagement of light, execution, and &s;ometimes compo&s;ition. I mention them in the order in which he &s;eems to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them. His expre&s;|&s;ion has mo&s;t force in the character of age. He marks as &s;trongly as the hand of Time it&s;elf. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es too in a great degree, that inferior
<PB N="85" REF="102">
kind of expre&s;&s;ion, which gives its proper, and characteri&s;tic touch to drapery, fur, metal, and every object he repre&s;ents. &mdash; His management of light con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in making a very &s;trong contra&s;t; which has often a good effect: and yet in many of his prints there is no effect at all; which gives us rea&s;on to think, he either had no principles; or publi&s;hed &s;uch prints before his principles were a&s;|certained. &mdash; His execution is pecu|liar to him&s;elf. It is rough, or neat, as he meant a &s;cetch, or a fini&s;hed piece; but always free, and ma&s;terly. It produces it's effect by &s;trokes in|ter&s;ected in every direction; and comes nearer the idea of painting, than the execution of any other ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="103">Never painter was more at a lo&s;s than REMBRANDT, for an idea of that &s;pecies of grace, which is nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;upport an elevated character. While he keeps within the &s;phere of his genius, and contents him&s;elf with low &s;ubjects, he de&s;erves any prai&s;e. But when he attempts beauty, or dignity, it were goodnatured to &s;uppo&s;e, he means only burle&s;que and charicature. He is a &s;trong contra&s;t to SALVATOR. The one drew all his ideas from nature, as &s;he appears with the utmo&s;t grace and elegance. The other caught her in her meane&s;t images; and transferred tho&s;e images into the highe&s;t cha|racters. Hence SALVATOR exalts banditti into heroes: REMBRANDT degrades patriarchs into beggars.
<PB N="87" REF="104">
REMBRANDT indeed &s;eems to have affected awkwardne&s;s. He was a man of humour; and would laugh at tho&s;e arti&s;ts who &s;tudied the an|tique. "I'll &s;hew you my antiques," he would cry; and then he would carry his friends into a room furni&s;h|ed with head-dre&s;&s;es, draperies, hou&s;|hold-&s;tuff, and in&s;truments of all kinds:
<Q>The&s;e, he would add, are worth all your antiques.</Q></P>
<P>His be&s;t etching is that, which goes by the name of the <HI>hundred-guildres-print;</HI> which is in &s;uch e&s;teem, that I have known twenty guineas given for a good impre&s;&s;ion of it.

de&s;cribed; but the principal figure is ridiculou&s;ly mean.</P>
<P>REMBRANDT is &s;aid to have left behind him near three hundred prints; none of which are dated be|fore M,DC,XXVIII; none after M,DC,LIX. They were in &s;uch e&s;teem, even in his own life-time, that he is &s;aid to have retouched &s;ome of them four, or five times.</P>
<P>PETER TESTA &s;tudied upon a plan very different from that either of SAL|VATOR or REMBRANDT. Tho&s;e ma&s;ters drew their ideas from nature: TESTA, from what he e&s;teemed a &s;uperior model &mdash; the antique. Smit with the love of painting, this arti&s;t travelled to Rome in the habit of a

pilgrim, de&s;titute of all the means of improvement, but what mere genius furni&s;hed. He had not even inte|re&s;t to procure a recommendation; nor had he any addre&s;s to &s;ub&s;titute in it's room. The works of &s;culp|ture fell mo&s;t obviou&s;ly in his way; and to tho&s;e he applied him&s;elf with &s;o much indu&s;try, copying them over, and again, that he is &s;aid to have gotten them all by heart. Thus qua|lified he took up the pencil. But he &s;oon found the &s;chool, in which he had &s;tudied, a very in&s;ufficient one to form a painter.

<P><PB N="90" REF="107">His prints are very valuable. We are &s;eldom indeed to expect a cohe|rency of de&s;ign in any of them.

<P>ROMAN LE HOOGHE is inimita|ble in execution. Perhaps no ma&s;ter etches in a freer and more &s;pirited manner: there is a richne&s;s in it likewi&s;e, which we &s;eldom meet with.

<P>MELLAN was a whim&s;ical en|graver. He &s;hadowed entirely with parallel lines, which he winds round the mu&s;cles of his figures, and the folds of his draperies, with great variety, and beauty. His manner is &s;oft and delicate, but void of &s;trength and effect. His compo&s;itions of cour&s;e make no <HI>whole,</HI> tho' his &s;in|gle figures are often elegant.

<P>LE CLERC was an excellent en|graver; but chiefly in the petite &s;tile. He immortalized ALEXANDER, and LEWIS XIV. in miniature. His genius &s;eldom exceeds the dimen|&s;ions of &s;ix inches. Within tho&s;e limits he can draw up twenty thou|&s;and men with great dexterity. No arti&s;t except CALLOT and DELLA BELLA could touch a &s;mall figure with &s;o much &s;pirit.

<P>JAC. FREII is an admirable en|graver. He unites in a great de|gree &s;trength, and &s;oftne&s;s; and comes as near the force of painting, as an engraver can well do. He employed him&s;elf chiefly in copying; and has given us the &s;tronge&s;t ideas of the works of &s;everal of the mo&s;t emi|nent ma&s;ters. He pre&s;erves the draw|ing, and expre&s;&s;ion of his original; and often perhaps improves the effect.

<P>LE BAS etches in a clear, di|&s;tinct, free manner; and has done great honour to the works of TE|NIERS, WOVERMAN, and BERG|HEM, from whom he chiefly copied. The be&s;t of his works are after BERG|HEM.</P>

forcing him from home, his incli|nations led him to Rome. His manner of travelling thither was whim&s;ical. He joined him&s;elf to a blind beggar, whom he agreed to lead for half his alms. At Rome, he applied to painting, and made a much greater proficiency than could have been expected from his di&s;&s;ipa|ted life. He publi&s;hed a large col|lection of &s;tatues, and other antiqui|ties, which are etched in a very ma|&s;terly manner. The drawing is often incorrect; but the attitudes are well cho&s;en, and the execution &s;pirited. Many of them &s;eem to have been done ha&s;tily; but there are marks of ge|nius in them all.</P>

<P>FRAN.

<P>Among the ma&s;ters in portrait REMBRANDT may take the lead. His heads are admirable copies from nature; and perhaps the be&s;t of his works. There is infinite expre&s;&s;ion in them and character.</P>
<P>VAN ULIET followed REM|BRANDT'S manner, which he hath in many things excelled. Some of his heads nothing can exceed. The force, which he gives to every fea|ture, the roundne&s;s of the mu&s;cle, the &s;pirit of the execution, the &s;trength of the character, and the effect of the whole, are all admirable.</P>

<P>Among the imitators of REM|BRANDT, we &s;hould not forget our countryman WORLIDGE; who has very ingeniou&s;ly followed the man|ner of that ma&s;ter; and &s;ometimes improved upon him. No man un|der&s;tood the drawing of an head bet|ter.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="144">Many of VAN DYKE'S etchings do him great credit. They are chiefly to be found in a collection of the por|traits of eminent arti&s;ts, which VAN DYKE was at the expence of get|ting engraved. Several of the&s;e he etched him&s;elf. They are done &s;lightly: but bear the character of a ma&s;ter. LUKE VOSTERMAN is one of the be&s;t.

<P>R. WHITE was the principal en|graver of portraits in CHARLES IId's reign; but his works are mi&s;erable performances. They are &s;aid to be good likene&s;&s;es: they may be &s;o; but they are wretched prints.</P>
<P>BECKET and SIMONS are names, which &s;carce de&s;erve to be mentioned. They were both metzotinto-&s;cra|pers, of note, only becau&s;e they were the be&s;t of their time.</P>
<P>WHITE, the metzotinto &s;craper, &s;on of the engraver, was an arti&s;t of great merit. He copied after Sir

GODFREY KNELLER; whom he teized &s;o much with his proofs, that it is &s;aid Sir GODFREY forbad him his hou&s;e. His metzotinto's are very beautiful. BAPTISTE, WING, STUR|GES, and HOOPER are all admirable prints. He him&s;elf u&s;ed to &s;ay, that old and young PARR were the be&s;t portraits he ever &s;craped. His manner was peculiar, at the time he u&s;ed it: tho' it hath &s;ince been adopted by other ma&s;ters. He fir&s;t etched his plate, and then &s;craped it.

<PB N="132" REF="149">
that the be&s;t of the&s;e metzotintos are inferior to what we have &s;een done by the ma&s;ters of the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>MELLAN'S portraits are the mo&s;t indifferent of his works. They want &s;trength, &s;pirit, and effect.</P>

<P>J. LUTMA'S heads are executed in the &s;ame way: we are told, with a chi&s;&s;el and mallet. They are infe|rior to MORIN'S; but are not with|out merit.</P>
<P>EDM. MARMION etched a few portraits in the manner of VAN|DYKE, and probably from him; in which there is great ea&s;e and free|dom. He has put his name only to one of them.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="157">DREVET'S portraits are neat and elegant; but laboured to the la&s;t de|gree. They are copied from RI|GAUD, and other French ma&s;ters; and abound in all that flutter, and licentious drapery, &s;o oppo&s;ite to the &s;imple and cha&s;te ideas of true ta&s;te. DREVET chiefly excells in copying RIGAUD'S frippery, lace, &s;ilk, fur, velvet, and other ornamental parts of dre&s;s.</P>
<P>RICHARDSON hath left us &s;everal heads, which he etched for Mr. POPE, and others of his friends. They are &s;light; but &s;hew the &s;pirit of a ma&s;ter. Mr. POPE'S profile is the be&s;t.</P>
<P>VERTUE was an excellent anti|quarian;
<PB N="135" REF="158">
but no arti&s;t. He copied with painful exactne&s;s; in a dry, di&s;|agreeable manner, without force, or freedom. In his whole collection of heads we can &s;carce pick out half a dozen, which are good.</P>
<P>Such an arti&s;t, in metzotinto, was FABER. He has publi&s;hed nothing extremely bad; and yet few things worth collecting. <HI>Mrs.</HI> COLLIER is one of his be&s;t prints; and a very good one. She is leaning again&s;t a pillar, on the ba&s;e of which is en|graved the &s;tory of the golden apple.</P>
<P>HOUBRAKEN is a genius; and has given us, in his collection of Engli&s;h portraits, &s;ome pieces of engraving at lea&s;t equal to any thing of the kind.

<P>Our countryman FRY has left be|hind him a few very beautiful heads in metzotinto. They are all copied from nature; have great &s;oftne&s;s, and &s;pirit; but want &s;trength. Metzo|tinto is not adapted to works &s;o large, as the heads he has publi&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>MASTERS IN ANIMAL LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>BERGHEM has a genius truly pa&s;|toral; and brings before us the mo&s;t agreeable &s;cenes of rural life. The &s;implicity of Arcadian manners is no where better de&s;cribed than in his works. We have a large collection of prints from his de&s;igns; many etched by him&s;elf, and many by o|ther ma&s;ters. Tho&s;e by him&s;elf are &s;light, but ma&s;terly. His execution is inimitable. His cattle, which are always the di&s;tingui&s;hing part of his pieces, are well-drawn, admirably characterized, and generally well-grouped. Few painters excelled more in compo&s;ition than BERGHEM; and
<PB N="138" REF="162">
yet we have more beautiful in&s;tances of it in the prints etched by others, than in tho&s;e by him&s;elf. Among his own etchings a few &s;mall plates of &s;heep, and goats are exceedingly valued.</P>
<P>J. VISSCHER never appears to more advantage, than when he copies BERGHEM. His excellent drawing, and the freedom of his execution give a great value to his prints, which have more the air of originals, than of copies. He is a ma&s;ter both in etching, and engraving. His &s;lighte&s;t etchings, tho' copies only, are the works of a ma&s;ter; and when he touches with a graver, he knows how to add &s;trength and firmne&s;s, without de&s;troying freedom and &s;pirit. He

might be &s;aid to have done every thing well, if he had not failed in the di&s;tribution of light: it is more than probable, he has not attended to the effect of it in many of the paintings, which he has copied.</P>
<P>HONDIUS, a native of Rotterdam, pa&s;&s;ed the greater part of his life in England. He painted animals chief|ly; was free in his manner; extrava|gant in his colouring; incorrect in his drawing; ignorant of the effect of light; but amazingly great in ex|pre&s;&s;ion. His prints therefore are better, than his pictures. They po&s;|&s;e&s;s his chief excellency without his defects. They are executed indeed with great &s;pirit; and afford &s;uch &s;trong in&s;tances of animal fury, as we meet
<PB N="140" REF="165">
with no where, but in nature it&s;elf. His <HI>hunted wolf</HI> is an admirable print.</P>
<P>DU JARDIN under&s;tood the ana|tomy of dome&s;tic animals perhaps better than any other ma&s;ter. His drawing is admirably correct; and yet the freedom of the ma&s;ter is pre|&s;erved. He copied nature &s;trictly, tho' not &s;ervilely; and hath given us not only the form, but the charac|teri&s;tic peculiarities of each animal. He never indeed, like HONDIUS, animates his creation with the vio|lence of &s;avage fury. His genius takes a milder turn. All is quietne&s;s, and repo&s;e. His dogs, after their exerci&s;e, are &s;tretched at their ea&s;e;
<PB REF="166">

and the languor of a meridian &s;un prevails commonly through all his pieces. His compo&s;ition is beautiful; and his execution, tho' neat, is &s;pi|rited.&mdash;His works, when bound to|gether, make a volume of about 50 leaves; among which there is &s;carce one bad print.</P>
<P>REUBENS'S huntings are undoubt|edly &s;uperior, upon the whole, to any thing of the kind we have. There is more invention in them, and a grander &s;tyle of compo&s;ition than we find any where el&s;e. I cla&s;s them under his name, becau&s;e they are en|graved by &s;everal ma&s;ters. But all their engravings are poor. They re|&s;emble the paintings they are copied from, as a &s;hadow does the object,
<PB N="142" REF="168">
which projects it. There is &s;ome|thing of the <HI>&s;hape;</HI> but all the <HI>fini&s;h|ing</HI> is lo&s;t. And indeed there is no doubt, but the awkwardne&s;&s;es, the patch-work, and the grote&s;que cha|racters, which every where appear in tho&s;e prints, are in the originals bold fore-&s;hortnings, grand effects of light, and noble in&s;tances of ex|pre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But it is as difficult to co|py the flights of REUBENS, as to tran&s;late tho&s;e of HOMER. The &s;pi|rit of each ma&s;ter evaporates in the proce&s;s.</P>
<P>WOVERMAN'S compo&s;ition is ge|nerally crouded with little ornaments. There is no &s;implicity in his works. He wanted a cha&s;te judgment to cor|rect his exuberance.&mdash;VISSCHER was
<PB N="143" REF="169">
the fir&s;t who engraved prints from this arti&s;t. He cho&s;e only a few good de&s;igns; and executed them ma&s;ter|ly.&mdash;MOYREAU undertook him next, and hath publi&s;hed a large collection. He hath fini&s;hed them highly; but with more &s;oftne&s;s than &s;pirit. His prints however have a neat appear|ance, and exhibit a variety of plea|&s;ing repre&s;entations; cavalcades, marches, huntings, and encamp|ments.</P>
<P>ROSA of TIVOLI etched in a very fini&s;hed manner. No one out-did him in compo&s;ition, and execution: He is very &s;kilful too in the manage|ment of light. His de&s;igns are all pa&s;toral; and yet there is often a mixture of the heroic &s;tyle in his

compo&s;ition, which is very plea&s;ing. His prints are &s;carce; and, were they not &s;o, would be valuable.</P>
<P>STEPHEN DE LA BELLA may be mentioned among the ma&s;ters in ani|mal life; tho' few of his works in this way de&s;erve any other prai&s;e, than what ari&s;es from the elegance of the execution. In general, his animals are neither well drawn, nor ju&s;tly characterized. The be&s;t of his works in animal life are &s;ome heads of camels and dromedaries.</P>
<P>ANTHONY TEMPESTA hath etch|ed &s;everal plates of &s;ingle hor&s;es, and of huntings. He hath given great expre&s;&s;ion to his animals; but his compo&s;ition is more than ordinarily
<PB N="145" REF="171">
bad in the&s;e prints: nor is there in any of them the lea&s;t effect of light.</P>
<P>J. FYT hath etched a few animals; in which you di&s;cover the drawing, and &s;omething of that inimitable &s;trength and &s;pirit, with which this ma&s;ter painted. But he has only done a few detached things in this way; nothing to &s;hew his &s;kill in compo|&s;ition, and the management of light, both which he well under&s;tood.</P>
<P>In curious collections we meet with a few of CUYP'S etchings. The <HI>pic|tures</HI> of this ma&s;ter excell in colour|ing, compo&s;ition, drawing, and the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of character. His <HI>prints</HI> have all the&s;e excellencies, except the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>PETER DE LAER hath left us &s;e|veral
<PB N="146" REF="172">
&s;mall etchings of hor&s;es, and other animals, well characterized, and executed in a bold and ma&s;terly manner. Many of them are &s;ingle figures; but when he compo&s;es, his compo&s;ition is generally good, and his di&s;tribution of light &s;eldom much ami&s;s; often very plea&s;ing: his drawing too is commonly good.</P>
<P>PETER STOOP came from Li&s;bon with queen Catherine; and was ad|mired in England, till WYCK'S &s;u|perior excellence in painting eclip&s;ed him. He hath etched a book of hor|&s;es, which are very much valued; as there is in general, accuracy in the drawing, nature in the characters, and &s;pirit in the execution.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="173">REMBRANDT'S lions, which are etched in his u&s;ual &s;tyle, are worthy the notice of a connoi&s;&s;eur.</P>
<P>BLOTELING'S lions are highly fi|ni&s;hed; but with more neatne&s;s than &s;pirit.</P>
<P>PAUL POTTER etched &s;everal plates of cows and hor&s;es in a ma&s;ter|ly manner. His manner indeed is better than his drawing; which, in his &s;heep e&s;pecially, is but very indif|ferent: neither does he characterize them with any accuracy.</P>
<P>BARLOW'S etchings are numerous. His illu&s;tration of E&s;op is his greate&s;t work. There is &s;omething plea&s;ing in the compo&s;ition, and manner of this ma&s;ter, tho' neither is excellent.

His drawing too is very indifferent; nor does he characterize any animal ju&s;tly. His birds in general are bet|ter than his bea&s;ts.</P>

<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this account with RI|DINGER, who is one of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters in animal life. He is &s;till living; but as he is &s;o capital in this way, he mu&s;t not be omitted. This arti&s;t has marked the characters of animals, e&s;pecially of the more &s;a|vage kind, with &s;urprizing expre&s;&s;i|on. His works may be con&s;idered as natural hi&s;tory. He carries us into the fore&s;t among bears, and tygers; and, with the exactne&s;s of a natura|li&s;t, de&s;cribes their forms, haunts, and manner of living.&mdash;His compo|&s;ition is generally beautiful, and his di&s;tribution of light good; &s;o that he commonly produces an agreeable whole. His land&s;kip too is picture&s;que
<PB N="150" REF="177">
and romantic, and well adapted to the &s;ubjects he treats. &mdash; On the other hand, his manner is laboured and wants freedom. His human fi|gures are &s;eldom drawn with ta&s;te. His hor&s;es are ill-characterized, and wor&s;e drawn; and indeed his draw|ing, in general, is but &s;lovenly.&mdash; The prints of this ma&s;ter are often real hi&s;tory, and repre&s;ent the por|traits of particular animals, which had been taken in hunting. We have &s;ometimes too the &s;tory of the chace, in high-dutch, at the bot|tom of the print. The idea of hi&s;|torical truth adds a reli&s;h to the en|tertainment; and we &s;urvey the ani|mal with new plea&s;ure, which has given diver&s;ion to a German prince for nine hours together.&mdash;The pro|ductions
<PB N="151" REF="178">
of RIDINGER are very nu|merous; and the greater part of them good. His huntings in general, and different methods of catching animals, are the lea&s;t picture&s;que of any of his works. But he meant them rather as didactic prints, than as pictures. Many of his fables are beautiful, par|ticularly the 3d, the 7th, the 8th, and the 10th. I cannot forbear ad|ding a particular encomium upon a book of the heads of wolves, and foxes.&mdash;His mo&s;t capital prints are two large uprights; one repre&s;enting bears devouring a deer; the other wild-boars repo&s;ing in a fore&s;t.</P>

<P>SADLER'S land&s;kips have &s;ome merit in compo&s;ition: they are pic|ture&s;que and romantic; but the man|ner is dry and di&s;agreeable, the light is ill-di&s;tributed, the di&s;tances ill-kept; and the figures bad.&mdash;There were three engravers of this name; but none of them eminent. JOHN engraved a &s;et of prints for the bible; and many other &s;mall plates in the hi&s;torical way; in which we &s;ome|times find a graceful figure, and to|lerable drawing; but on the whole, no great merit. EGIDIUS was the engraver of land&s;kips, and is the per|&s;on here criticized. RALPH chiefly
<PB N="153" REF="180">
copied the de&s;igns of BASSAN; and engraved in the dry di&s;agreeable man|ner of his brother.</P>
<P>REMBRANDT'S land&s;kips have ve|ry little to recommend them, be&s;ides their effect; which is often &s;urpri|zing. One of the mo&s;t admired of them goes under the name of <HI>The three trees.</HI></P>
<P>GASPER POUSSIN etched a few land&s;kips in a very loo&s;e, but ma&s;ter|ly manner. It is a pity we have not more of his works.</P>
<P>ABRAHAM BLOEMART under&s;tood the beauty of compo&s;ition, as well in land&s;kip, as in hi&s;tory. His prints have little force, through the want of a proper di&s;tribution of light. Nei|ther
<PB N="154" REF="181">
is there much freedom in the ex|ecution; but there is generally great elegance in the de&s;ign, and great &s;im|plicity.</P>
<P>HOLLAR gives us views of parti|cular places, which he copies with great truth, unornamented, as he found them. If we are &s;atisfied with exact repre&s;entations, we have them no where better than in HOLLAR'S works: but if we expect pictures, we mu&s;t &s;eek them el&s;ewhere. HOL|LAR was an antiquarian, and a draught&s;man; but &s;eems to have been unacquainted with any one prin|ciple of painting. Stiffne&s;s to the la&s;t degree is his characteri&s;tic, and a pain|ful exactne&s;s, utterly void of all ta&s;te. His larger views are mere plans. In

&s;ome of his &s;maller, at the expence of infinite pains, &s;omething of an ef|fect is &s;ometimes produced. But in general, we con&s;ider him as a repo|&s;itory of curio&s;ities, a record of an|tiquated dre&s;&s;es, aboli&s;hed ceremonies, and edifices now in ruins.</P>
<P>STEPHEN DE LA BELLA'S land|&s;kips have little to recommend them, be&s;ides their neatne&s;s, and keeping. There is no great beauty in his com|po&s;ition; and the foliage of his trees re&s;embles bits of &s;punge. I &s;peak chiefly of his larger works; for which his manner is not calculated. His great neatne&s;s qualifies him better for miniature.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="184">BOLSWERT'S land&s;kips after REU|BENS are compo&s;ed in a very grand &s;tyle. Such a painter and &s;uch an engraver could not fail of producing &s;omething great. There is little va|riety in them; nor any of the more minute beauties ari&s;ing from contra&s;ts, catching lights, and &s;uch little ele|gancies; but every thing is &s;imple, and great. The print, which goes by the name of <HI>The waggon,</HI> is par|ticularly, and de&s;ervedly admired. Of the&s;e prints you generally meet with good impre&s;&s;ions, as the plates are engraved with great &s;trength.</P>
<P>NEULANT hath etched a &s;mall book of the ruins of Rome, in which there is great &s;implicity, and &s;ome &s;kill in compo&s;ition, and the di&s;|tribution
<PB N="157" REF="185">
of light: but the execution is har&s;h and di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>We have a few land&s;kips by an earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> in an elegant, loo&s;e manner. One of them, in which is is a Spaniard &s;tanding on the fore|ground, is marked <HI>G.</HI> and <HI>J. &s;culp&s;e|runt:</HI> another <HI>J. G.</HI></P>
<P>WATERLO is a name beyond any other in land&s;kip. His &s;ubjects are perfectly rural. Simplicity is their characteri&s;tic. We find no great va|riety in them, nor &s;tretch of fancy. He &s;elects a few &s;triking objects. A coppice, a corner of a fore&s;t, a wind|ing-road, or a &s;tragling village is ge|nerally the extent of his view: nor does he always introduce an off&s;kip.
<PB N="158" REF="186">
His compo&s;ition is generally good, and his light often well di&s;tributed; but his chief merit lies in execution, in which he is a con&s;ummate ma&s;ter. Every object, that he touches, has the character of nature: but he par|ticularly excells in the foliage of trees.&mdash;It is a difficult matter to meet with the works of this ma&s;ter in perfection: the original plates are all retouched, and greatly injured.</P>
<P>SWANEVELT painted land&s;kip at Rome, where he obtained the name of <HI>the hermit,</HI> from his &s;olitary walks among the ruins of TIVOLI, and FRESCATI. He etched in the man|ner of WATERLO; but with le&s;s freedom. His trees, in particular, will bear no compari&s;on with tho&s;e
<PB N="159" REF="187">
of that ma&s;ter. And yet, upon the whole, his works have great merit. We &s;hould think them excellent, if the idea of WATERLO'S &s;uperiority in the &s;ame &s;tyle of etching did not con&s;tantly recur.</P>
<P>JAMES ROUSSEAU was the di&s;ci|ple of SWANEVELT. He was a French prote&s;tant, and fled into Eng|land from the per&s;ecution of Lewis XIV. Here he was patronized by the duke of MONTAGUE, who&s;e palace, now the <HI>Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum,</HI> he contributed to adorn with his paint|ings; &s;ome of which are very good. The few etchings he hath left are very beautiful. He under&s;tood com|po&s;ition, and the di&s;tribution of light; and there is a fine ta&s;te in his land|&s;kips,
<PB N="160" REF="188">
if we except perhaps only that his horizon is often taken too high. Neither can his per&s;pective, at all times, bear a critical examination; and what is wor&s;e, it is often pedanti|cally introduced. His figures are good in them&s;elves, and generally well placed.&mdash;His manner is rather dry and formal.&mdash;ROUSSEAU, it may be added, was an excellent man. Having e&s;caped the rage of per&s;ecu|tion him&s;elf, he made it his &s;tudy to le&s;&s;en the &s;ufferings of his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed brethren by di&s;tributing among them the greate&s;t part of his gains. Such an anecdote in the life of a painter, &s;hould not be omitted even in &s;o &s;hort a review as this.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="189">J. LUTMA hath etched a few &s;mall land&s;kips in a ma&s;terly manner, which di&s;cover &s;ome &s;kill in compo&s;ition, and the management of light.</P>
<P>ISRAEL SYLVESTRE has given us &s;mall views (&s;ome indeed of a larger &s;ize) of mo&s;t of the capital ruins, churches, bridges, and ca&s;tles in Italy and France. They are ex|ceedingly neat, and touched with great &s;pirit. This ma&s;ter can give beauty even to the out-lines of a mo|dern building; and, what is more, he gives it, without injuring the truth: in&s;omuch that I have &s;een a gentleman ju&s;t come from his travels, pick out many of SYLVESTRE'S views, one by one, tho' he had never &s;een them before, merely from his ac|quaintance
<PB N="162" REF="190">
with the buildings. To his prai&s;e it may be farther added, that in general he forms his view in|to an agreeable whole; and if his light is not always well di&s;tributed, there are &s;o many beauties in his ex|ecution, that the eye cannot find fault. His works are very numerous, and few of them are bad. In trees he excels lea&s;t.</P>
<P>The etchings of CLAUDE LORRAIN are below his character. We &s;ome|times find good compo&s;ition in them; but little el&s;e. His execution is bad: there is a dirtine&s;s in it, which is di&s;gu&s;ting: his trees are heavy; his lights &s;eldom well-ma&s;&s;ed; and his di&s;tances only &s;ometimes ob&s;erved.&mdash; The truth is, CLAUDE'S talents lay
<PB N="163" REF="191">
upon his pallet; and he could do no|thing without it.</P>
<P>PERELLE has great merit. His fancy is exceedingly fruitful; and &s;upplies him with a richne&s;s, and va|riety in his views, which nature &s;el|dom exhibits. It is indeed too ex|uberant; for he often confounds the eye with too great a luxuriancy. His manner is his own; and it is hard to &s;ay, whether it excells mo&s;t in richne&s;s, &s;trength, elegance, or free|dom. His trees are particularly beau|tiful; the foliage is loo&s;e, and the ramification ea&s;y and graceful. And yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that PERELLE is rather a manneri&s;t, than a co|pier of nature. His views are all ideal; his trees are of one family;
<PB N="164" REF="192">
and his light, tho' generally well di&s;tributed, is &s;ometimes affected: it is introduced as a &s;pot; and is not properly melted into the neighbour|ing &s;hade by a middle tint. Catch|ing lights, u&s;ed &s;paringly, are beau|tiful: PERELLE affects them.&mdash; The&s;e remarks are made principally upon the works of <HI>old</HI> PERELLE, as he is called. There were three en|gravers of this name; the grandfa|ther, the father, and the &s;on. They all engraved in the &s;ame &s;tyle; but the juniors, in&s;tead of improving the the family-ta&s;te, degenerated. The grandfather is the be&s;t, and the grand|&s;on the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>OVERBECK etched a book of Ro|man ruins; which are in general,
<PB N="165" REF="193">
good. They are pretty large, and highly fini&s;hed. His manner is free, his light often well di&s;tributed, and his compo&s;ition agreeable.</P>
<P>GENOEL'S land&s;kips are rather free &s;cetches, than fini&s;hed prints. In that light they are beautiful. No effect is aimed at: but the free man|ner, in which they are touched, is plea&s;ing; and the compo&s;ition is in general good, tho' often crouded.</P>
<P>BOTH'S ta&s;te in land&s;kip is elegant. His ideas are grand; his compo&s;ition beautiful; and his execution bold, and ma&s;terly. His light too is com|monly well di&s;tributed; and his fi|gures are excellent. We regret only, that we have &s;o few of his works.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="194">MARCO RICCI'S works, which are numerous, have little merit. His human figures indeed are good, and his trees tolerable; but he produces no effect, his manner is di&s;gu&s;ting, his cattle ill-drawn, and his di&s;tan|ces ill-pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>ZEEMAN was a Dutch painter; and excelled in &s;ea-coa&s;ts, beaches, and di&s;tant land; which he common|ly ornamented with &s;kiffs, and fi&s;h|ing-boats. His execution is neat, and his di&s;tances well kept. Of the di&s;tribution of light he knows no|thing; and the fore-grounds of ma|ny of his prints are for that rea&s;on particularly bad. But his figures are good, and his &s;kiffs admirable. In his <HI>&s;ea-pieces</HI> he introduces larger ve&s;|&s;els;
<PB N="167" REF="195">
but his prints in this &s;tyle are commonly awkward; and di&s;agree|able.</P>
<P>VANDIEST left behind him a few rough &s;cetches, which are executed with great freedom.</P>
<P>GOUPY very happily caught the manner of SALVATOR; and in &s;ome things excelled him. There is a rich|ne&s;s in his execution, and a &s;pirit in his trees, which SALVATOR wants. But his figures are bad. Very gro&s;s in&s;tances not only of indelicacy of out|line, but even of bad drawing, may be found in his print of PORSENNA, and in that of DIANA. Land&s;kip is his &s;ort; and his be&s;t prints are tho&s;e, which go under the titles of the <HI>La|trones,</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="196">
the <HI>Augurs, Tobit, Hagar,</HI> and its companion.</P>
<P>Our celebrated countryman HO|GARTH cannot properly be omitted in a catalogue of engravers; and yet he ranks in none of the foregoing cla&s;&s;es. With this apology I &s;hall in|troduce him here.</P>
<P>The works of this ma&s;ter abound in true humour; and &s;atyr, which is generally well-directed: they are admirable moral le&s;&s;ons, and a fund of entertainment &s;uited to every ta&s;te; a circum&s;tance, which &s;hews them to be ju&s;t copies of nature. We may con&s;ider them too as valuable repo&s;i|tories of the manners, cu&s;toms, and dre&s;&s;es of the pre&s;ent age. What a fund of entertainment would a col|lection
<PB N="169" REF="197">
of this kind afford, drawn from every period of the hi&s;tory of Britain?&mdash;How far the works of HO|GARTH will bear a <HI>critical examinati|on,</HI> may be the &s;ubject of a little more enquiry.</P>
<P>In <HI>de&s;ign</HI> HOGARTH was &s;eldom at a lo&s;s. His invention was fertile; and his judgment accurate. An im|proper incident is rarely introduced; a proper one rarely omitted. No one could tell a &s;tory better; or make it, in all its circum&s;tances, more intelli|gible. His genius, however, it mu&s;t be owned, was &s;uited only to <HI>low,</HI> or <HI>familiar</HI> &s;ubjects. It never &s;oared above <HI>common</HI> life: to &s;ubjects natu|rally &s;ublime: or which from anti|quity, or other accidents borrowed dignity, he could not ri&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="198">In <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> we &s;ee little in him to admire. In many of his prints the deficiency is &s;o great as plainly to &s;hew a want of all principles; it makes us ready to believe, that when we do meet with a beautiful group, it is the effect of chance. In one of his minor works, the <HI>Idle 'prentice,</HI> we &s;eldom &s;ee a croud more beautifully managed, than in the la&s;t print. If the &s;he|riff's officers had not been placed in a line, and had been brought a little lower in the picture, &s;o as to have formed a pyramid with the cart, the compo&s;ition had been unexceptiona|ble: and yet the fir&s;t print of this work is &s;uch a &s;triking in&s;tance of di&s;agreeable compo&s;ition, that it is amazing, how an arti&s;t, who had any idea of beautiful forms, could
<PB N="171" REF="199">
&s;uffer &s;o unma&s;terly a performance to leave his hands.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>di&s;tribution of light</HI> HO|GARTH had as little knowledge as of <HI>compo&s;ition.</HI> In &s;ome of his pieces we &s;ee a good effect; as in the <HI>Exe|cution</HI> ju&s;t mentioned; in which if the figures at the right and left cor|ners, had been <HI>kept down</HI> a little, the light would have been beautifully di&s;tributed on the foreground, and a fine &s;econdary light &s;pread over part of the croud: but at the &s;ame time there is &s;o obvious a deficiency in point of effect, in mo&s;t of his prints, that it is very evident he had no prin|ciples.</P>
<P>Neither was HOGARTH a ma&s;ter in <HI>drawing.</HI> Of the mu&s;cles and ana|tomy of the head and hands he had
<PB N="172" REF="200">
perfect knowledge; but his trunks are often badly moulded, and his limbs ill &s;et on. I tax him with plain bad drawing, I &s;peak not of the ni|ceties of anatomy, and elegance of out-line: of the&s;e indeed he knew nothing; nor were they of u&s;e in that mode of de&s;ign, which he cultivated: and yet his figures upon the whole are in&s;pired with &s;o much life, and meaning, that the eye is kept in good-humour, in &s;pite of its inclina|tion to find fault.</P>
<P>The author of the <HI>Analy&s;is of beau|ty,</HI> it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, would have given us more in&s;tances of <HI>grace,</HI> than we find in the works of HOGARTH; which &s;hews &s;trongly that theory and practice are not always united. Many opportunities his &s;ubjects naturally
<PB N="173" REF="201">
afford of introducing graceful atti|tudes; and yet we have very few ex|amples of them. With in&s;tances of picture&s;que grace his works abound.</P>
<P>But of his <HI>expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> in which the force of his genius lay, we cannot &s;peak in terms too high. In every mode of it he was truely ex|cellent. The pa&s;&s;ions he thoroughly under&s;tood; and all the effects which they produce in every part of the hu|man frame: he had the happy art al&s;o of conveying his ideas with the &s;ame preci&s;ion, with which he con|ceived them.&mdash; He was excellent too in expre&s;&s;ing any humourous oddity, which we often &s;ee &s;tamped upon the human face. All his heads are ca&s;t in the very mould of nature. Hence that endle&s;s variety, which is di&s;|played
<PB N="174" REF="202">
through his works; and hence it is that the difference ari&s;es between <HI>his</HI> heads, and the affected charica|turas of <HI>tho&s;e ma&s;ters,</HI> who have &s;ometimes amu&s;ed them&s;elves with patching together an a&s;&s;emblage of features from their own ideas. Such are SPANIOLET'S; which, tho' ad|mirably executed, appear plainly to have no archetypes in nature. HO|GARTH'S, on the other hand, are collections of natural curio&s;ities. The <HI>Oxford-heads,</HI> the <HI>phy&s;icians-arms,</HI> and &s;ome of his other pieces, are expre&s;ly of this humourous kind. They are truly comic; tho' ill-na|tured effu&s;ions of mirth: more en|tertaining than SPANIOLET'S, as they are pure nature; but le&s;s inno|cent, as they contain ill-directed ridi|cule.&mdash;But
<PB N="175" REF="203">
the &s;pecies of expre&s;&s;ion, in which this ma&s;ter perhaps mo&s;t excels, is that happy art of catching tho&s;e peculiarities of air, and ge&s;ture, which the ridiculous part of every profe&s;&s;ion contract from their peculi|ar &s;ituation; and which for that rea|&s;on become characteri&s;tic of the whole. His coun&s;ellors, his under|takers, his lawyers, his u&s;urers are all con&s;picuous at &s;ight. In a word, almo&s;t every profe&s;&s;ion may &s;ee in his works that particular &s;pecies of affec|tation, which they &s;hould mo&s;t en|deavour to avoid.</P>
<P>The <HI>execution</HI> of this ma&s;ter is well &s;uited to his &s;ubjects, and manner of treating them. He etches with great &s;pirit; and never gives one unnece&s;&s;ary &s;troke. For my&s;elf, I greatly more
<PB N="176" REF="204">
value the works of his own needle; than tho&s;e high-fini&s;hed prints, on which he employed other engravers. For as the production of an effect is not his talent; and as this is the chief excellence of high-fini&s;hing, his own rough manner is certainly preferable, in which we have mo&s;t of the force, and &s;pirit of his expre&s;&s;ion. The <HI>man|ner</HI> in none of his works plea&s;es me &s;o well, as in a &s;mall print of a cor|ner of a play-hou&s;e. There is more &s;pirit in a work of this kind, &s;truck off at once, warm from the imagi|nation, than in all the cold correct|ne&s;s of an elaborate engraving. If all his works had been executed in this &s;tyle, with a few improve|ments in the compo&s;ition, and the management of light, they would
<PB N="177" REF="205">
certainly have been a much more valuable collection of prints than they are. The <HI>rake's progre&s;s,</HI> and &s;ome of his other works, are both etched and engraved by him&s;elf: they are well done; but it is plain he meant them as furniture. As works de&s;igned for a critick's eye, they would certainly have been better without the engraving, except a few touches in a very few places. The want of effect too would have been le&s;s con&s;picuous, which in his high|e&s;t fini&s;hed prints is di&s;agreeably &s;triking.</P>

<HEAD>THE RESURRECTION OF LA|ZARUS, BY BLOEMART.</HEAD>
<P>WITH regard to <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> this print has great merit. The point of time is very judiciou&s;ly cho|&s;en. It is a point between the fir&s;t command, <HI>Lazarus come forth;</HI> and
<PB N="180" REF="207">
the &s;econd, <HI>Loo&s;e him, and let him go.</HI> The fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment of the two &s;i&s;ters is now over. The predomi|nant pa&s;&s;ion is gratitude; which is di&s;covering it&s;elf in prai&s;e. One of the attendents is telling the yet &s;tu|pified man, "That is your &s;i&s;ter." He him&s;elf, collecting his &s;cattered ideas, directs his gratitude to Chri&s;t. Je&s;us directs it farther, to heaven. So far the de&s;ign is good. But what are tho&s;e idle figures on the right hand, and on the left? &s;ome of them &s;eem no way concerned in the action. Two of the principal of them are introduced as grave-diggers; but even in that capacity they were unwanted; for <HI>the place,</HI> we are told, <HI>was a cave, and a &s;tone rolled upon the mouth.</HI> When a painter is employed on a
<PB N="181" REF="208">
barren &s;ubject, he mu&s;t make up his groups as he is able: but there is no barrenne&s;s here: and the painter might with propriety have introdu|ced in the room of the grave-diggers, &s;ome of the Phari&s;aical party malig|ning the action. Such we are told were on the &s;pot. They are figures of con&s;equence in the &s;tory; and ought not to have been &s;hoved back, as they are, among the appendages of the piece.</P>
<P>The <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> is almo&s;t faultle&s;s. The principal group is finely di&s;po&s;ed. It's form is nearly that of a right-an|gled triangle. The hand of Chri&s;t is the apex. The kneeling figure, and the dark figure looking up make the two other angles. The group
<PB N="182" REF="209">
opens in a beautiful manner, and di&s;|covers every part. It is equally beau|tiful, when con&s;idered, as combined with the figures on the left. It then forms an ea&s;y inclined plane, of which the highe&s;t figure is the apex, and the dark figure ju&s;t mentioned, on the left of Lazarus is the angle at the ba&s;e. Such combinations of trian|gular forms have a fine effect.</P>
<P>The <HI>light</HI> is very ill-di&s;tributed, tho' the figures are di&s;po&s;ed to receive the mo&s;t beautiful effect of it. The whole is one glare. It had been bet|ter, if all the figures on the elevated ground, on the right, had been in &s;trong &s;hadow. The extended arm, the head, and &s;houlder of the grave-digger might have received catching
<PB N="183" REF="210">
lights. A little more light might have been thrown upon the principal figure; and a little le&s;s upon the fi|gure kneeling. The remaining fi|gures, on the left, &s;hould have been kept down. Thus the light would have centered &s;trongly upon the ca|pital group, and would have faded gradually away.</P>
<P>The &s;ingle figures are in general good. The principal one indeed is not &s;o capital as might be wi&s;hed. The character is not quite plea&s;ing; the right arm is aukwardly introdu|ced, if not ill-drawn; and the whole di&s;agreably incumbered with drape|ry.&mdash;Lazarus is very fine: the draw|ing, the expre&s;&s;ion, and grace of the figure are all good.&mdash;The figure
<PB N="184" REF="211">
kneeling is not very graceful; but it contra&s;ts with the group.&mdash;The grave-diggers are both admirable fi|gures. It is a pity, they &s;hould be incumbrances only.</P>
<P>The <HI>drawing</HI> is good; yet there &s;eems to be &s;omething ami&s;s in the pectoral mu&s;cles of the grave-digger on the right. The hands too, in general, of all the figures, are con|&s;trained and aukward. Few of them are in natural action.</P>
<P>The <HI>manner</HI> is &s;trong, di&s;tinct, and expre&s;&s;ive. It is mere engraving, without any etching. The drapery of the kneeling figure is particularly well touched: as are al&s;o the head, and leg of LAZARUS; and the grave-digger on the left.</P>

<P>The <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> is agreeable. The contrivance of the groups, falling one into another, is very plea&s;ing: And yet the form would have been more beautiful, if a ladder, with a figure upon it, a piece of loo&s;e drapery, a &s;tandard, or &s;ome other object had been placed on the left &s;ide of the cro&s;s, to have filled up that formal vacancy, in the &s;hape of a right-an|gle, and to have made the pyramid more compleat.

<P>The <HI>de&s;ign</HI> &s;eems to be perfect. The God is introduced in the middle of the piece, holding an ivy-crown, and &s;upported by his train, in all the pomp of unwieldy maje&s;ty.

hard by a mountain, dedicated to lewdne&s;s, nymphs and &s;atyrs. &mdash; In the heavens are repre&s;ented the <HI>Moon</HI> and <HI>Stars</HI> pu&s;hing back the <HI>Sun;</HI> to &s;hew that the actions, of which this night was a witne&s;s, dreaded the ap|proach of light.</P>
<P>The <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> has le&s;s merit; yet is not unplea&s;ing. The <HI>whole</HI> group, on the left of SILENUS, and the <HI>&s;e|veral parts</HI> of it, are happily di&s;po|&s;ed. The group of dancers, on the other &s;ide, is crouded, and ill-&s;hapen. It is di&s;agreeable too for want of con|tra&s;t. The two principal figures, each &s;tanding on one leg, appear di&s;|gu&s;ting counter-parts. The <HI>whole</HI> (I &s;peak only of the terre&s;trial groups) is di&s;po&s;ed in the form of an ea&s;y in|clined
<PB N="192" REF="219">
plane; which partakes as lit|tle as po&s;&s;ible of the pyramidal form. It might perhaps have had a better effect, if an elegant canopy had been holden over SILENUS, which would have been no improper appendage; and, by bringing the apex of the pyramid over the principal figure, would hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> given more variety to the whole. The &s;amene&s;s too in the di&s;|po&s;ition of the etherial and the ter|re&s;trial figures, which is rather di&s;|plea&s;ing, would have been prevented by this &s;light alteration.</P>
<P>The <HI>light,</HI> with regard to <HI>particu|lar figures</HI> is very beautiful. But &s;uch a light, at be&s;t, gives you only the idea of a picture examined by a can|dle. Every figure, as you hold the

The upper part is inlightened by one &s;un, and the lower part by another; the direction of the light being different in each.&mdash; Should we endeavour to amend it, it might be better perhaps to leave out the Sun; and to repre&s;ent him, by his &s;ymbols, as <HI>approaching</HI> only. The &s;ky-figures would of cour&s;e re|ceive catching lights, and might be left nearly as they are. The figure of <HI>Rain</HI> under the <HI>Moon</HI> &s;hould be in &s;hadow. The bear too, and the li|on's head &s;hould be <HI>kept down.</HI> Thus there would be nothing glaring in the cele&s;tial figures. For SILENUS, and
<PB N="194" REF="221">
his train, they might be enlightened by a very &s;trong torch-light; which might be carried by the dancing fi|gures. The light would then fall nearly as it does, upon the principal group. The other figures &s;hould be <HI>brought down</HI> to a middle tint. This kind of light would naturally produce a gloom in the back-ground; but there is no occa&s;ion to make it dark, as more torch-light might be &s;uppo|&s;ed.</P>
<P>With regard to the figures taken &s;eparately, they are conceived with &s;uch cla&s;&s;ical purity, and &s;implicity of ta&s;te, &s;o elegant in the drawing, &s;o graceful in every attitude, and at the &s;ame time marked with &s;uch man|ly expre&s;&s;ion, that if I were obliged to fix upon any print as an example

of all the beauties, of which &s;ingle figures are capable of receiving, I &s;hould be tempted to give the prefe|rence to this: tho' at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be owned, that &s;ome of them give you too much the idea of mar|ble.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;triking in&s;tances of fine <HI>drawing</HI> are &s;een in the principal fi|gure; in the legs of the figure that &s;upports him; and in tho&s;e of the fi|gure dancing with the pipes; in the man and woman behind the centaur; in the figure in the clouds, with his right hand over his knee; in the A|pollo; and particularly in that bold, fore-&s;hortened figure of the &s;ign Ca|pricorn.</P>
<P>In&s;tances of <HI>expre&s;&s;ion</HI> we have in the unweildine&s;s of SILENUS. He

appears &s;o dead a weight, &s;o totally unela&s;tic, that every part of him, which is not &s;upported, &s;inks with its own gravity. The &s;en&s;ibility too with which his bloated body, like a quagmire, feels every touch, is &s;trong|ly expre&s;&s;ed in his countenance. The figure, which &s;upports him, expre&s;|&s;es in every mu&s;cle the labour of the action. The dancing figures, if we except that with the thyr&s;us, are all &s;trongly characterized. The pu&s;hing figures in the &s;ky are marked with great expre&s;&s;ion; and above all the threatning Capricorn, who is repre|&s;ented in the act of drawing a bow.</P>
<P>With regard to <HI>grace,</HI> every figure, at lea&s;t every capital one, is agreeable; if we except only that figure, which lies kicking its legs upon the ground.
<PB N="197" REF="224">
But we have the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tances of grace in the figure dancing with the pipes, in the man and woman behind the centaur, (which, it is not im|probable, might be de&s;igned for BAC|CHUS and ARIADNE) and in the boy lying on the ground.</P>

In&s;tead of the country-taylor, who took mea&s;ure of him for his father's mourn|ing, he is now attended by French-barbers, French-taylors, poets, mil|liners, jockies, bullies, and the whole
<PB N="219" REF="246">
retinue of a fine gentleman.&mdash;The <HI>expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> in this print, is wonder|fully great. The dauntle&s;s front of the bully; the keen eye, and ela&s;ti|city of the fencing-ma&s;ter, and the &s;impering importance of the dancing-ma&s;ter are admirably expre&s;&s;ed. The la&s;t is perhaps rather a little outr&egrave;; and it may be added, but very indif|ferently drawn. The architect is a &s;trong copy from nature.&mdash;The <HI>com|po&s;ition</HI> &s;eems to be entirely &s;ub&s;er|vient to the expre&s;&s;ion. It appears, as if HOGARTH had &s;cetched in his memorandum-book all the charac|ters, which he has here introduced; but was at a lo&s;s how to group them; and cho&s;e rather to introduce them in detached figures, as he had &s;cetch|ed them, than to lo&s;e any part of the
<PB N="220" REF="247">
expre&s;&s;ion by combining them.&mdash;The <HI>light</HI> is very ill di&s;tributed. It is &s;pread indi&s;criminately over the print; and de&s;troys the <HI>whole.</HI>&mdash;We have no in&s;tance of <HI>grace</HI> in any of the fi|gures. The principal figure is very deficient. There is no contra&s;t in the limbs; which is always attended with a degree of ungracefulne&s;s.&mdash; The <HI>execution</HI> is very good. It is ela|borate, and yet free.&mdash;The &s;atyr on operas, tho' it may be well-directed, is forced and unnatural.</P>
<P>The third plate carries us &s;till deeper in the hi&s;tory. We meet our hero engaged in one of his evening-amu&s;ements. This print, on the whole, is no very extraordinary ef|fort of genius.&mdash;The <HI>de&s;ign</HI> is good;
<PB N="221" REF="248">
and may be a very exact de&s;cription of the humours of a brothel.&mdash;The <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> too is not ami&s;s. But we have few of tho&s;e ma&s;terly &s;trokes, which di&s;tingui&s;h the works of HO|GARTH. The whole is plain hi&s;tory. The lady &s;etting the world on fire, is the be&s;t thought: and there is &s;ome humour in furni&s;hing the room with a &s;et of Cae&s;ars; and not placing them in order.&mdash;The <HI>light</HI> is ill-managed. By a few alterations, which are ob|vious, particularly by throwing the lady dre&s;&s;ing, into the &s;hade, the di&s;po&s;ition of it might have been to|lerable. But &s;till we &s;hould have had an ab&s;urdity to an&s;wer, whence comes it? Here is light in abun|dance; but no vi&s;ible &s;ource.&mdash;<HI>Ex|pre&s;&s;ion</HI> we have very little through
<PB N="222" REF="249">
the whole print. The principal fi|gure is the be&s;t. The ladies have all the air of their profe&s;&s;ion; but no variety of character. HOGARTH'S women are, in general, very inferior to his men. For which rea&s;on I pre|fer the <HI>rake's progre&s;s</HI> to the <HI>harlot's.</HI> The female-face indeed has &s;eldom &s;trength of feature enough to admit the &s;trong markings of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Very di&s;agreeable accidents often befall gentlemen of plea&s;ure. An event of this kind is recorded in the fourth print; which is now before us. Our hero going, in full dre&s;s, to pay his compliments at court, on St. Da|vid's-day, was acco&s;ted in the rude manner, which is here repre&s;ented. &mdash;The <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> is good. The form
<PB N="223" REF="250">
of the group, made up of the figures in action, the chair, and the lamp-lighter, is plea&s;ing. Only here we have an opportunity of remarking, that a group is di&s;gu&s;ting, when the extremities of it are heavy. A group in &s;ome re&s;pect &s;hould re&s;emble a tree. The heavier part of the foliage, (the <HI>cup,</HI> as the land&s;kip-painter calls it) is always near the middle: the out|&s;ide-branches, which are relieved by the &s;ky, are light and airy. An in|attention to this rule has given a heavine&s;s to the group before us. The two bailiffs, the woman, and the chairman are all huddled together in that part of the group, which &s;hould have been the lighte&s;t; while the middle part, where the hand holds the door, wants &s;trength and
<PB N="224" REF="251">
con&s;i&s;tence. It may be added too, that the four heads, in the form of a diamond, make an unplea&s;ing &s;hape. All regular figures &s;hould &s;tudiou&s;ly be avoided.&mdash;The <HI>light</HI> would have been well di&s;tributed, if the bailiff holding the arre&s;t, and the chairman, had been a little lighter, and the wo|man darker. The glare of the white apron is di&s;agreeable.&mdash;We have, in this print, &s;ome beautiful in&s;tances of <HI>expre&s;&s;ion.</HI> The &s;urprize and ter|ror of the poor gentleman is appa|rent in every limb, as far as is con|&s;i&s;tent with the fear of di&s;compo&s;ing his dre&s;s. The in&s;olence of power in one of the bailiffs, and the un|feeling heart in the other, which can je&s;t with mi&s;ery, are &s;trongly marked. The &s;elf-importance too of the hone&s;t
<PB N="225" REF="252">
Cambrian is not ill-portrayed; who is chiefly introduced to &s;ettle the chronology of the &s;tory.&mdash;In point of <HI>grace,</HI> we have nothing &s;triking. HOGARTH might have introduced a degree of it in the female figure; at lea&s;t he might have contrived to vary the di&s;agreeable, and heavy form of her drapery.&mdash;The <HI>per&s;pective</HI> is good, and makes an agreeable &s;hape. &mdash;I cannot leave this print without remarking the <HI>falling ban-box.</HI> Such repre&s;entations of quick motion are very ab&s;urd; and every moment the ab&s;urdity grows &s;tronger. You can|not deceive the eye. The falling bo|dy <HI>mu&s;t</HI> appear <HI>not</HI> to fall. Objects of that kind are beyond the power of repre&s;entation.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="253">Difficulties croud &s;o fa&s;t upon our hero, that at the age of twenty-five, which he &s;eems to have attained in the fifth plate, we find him driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of marrying a woman, whom he dete&s;ts, for her fortune. The <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> here is very good; and yet we have a di&s;agreeable regu|larity in the climax of the three fi|gures, the maid, the bride, and the bride-groom.&mdash;The <HI>light</HI> is not ill-di&s;tributed. The principal figure too is <HI>graceful;</HI> and there is &s;trong <HI>ex|pre&s;&s;ion</HI> in the &s;eeming tranquility of his features. He hides his contempt of the object before him, as well as he can; and yet he cannot do it. She too has as much meaning, as can appear through the deformity of her features. The clergyman's face we
<PB N="227" REF="254">
are well acquainted with, and al&s;o his wig; tho' we cannot pretend to &s;ay, where we have &s;een either. The clerk too is an admirable fellow. &mdash; The <HI>per&s;pective</HI> is well under&s;tood; but the church is too &s;mall; and the wooden po&s;t, which &s;eems to have no u&s;e, divides the picture very di&s;|agreeably.&mdash;The creed lo&s;t, the com|mandments broken, and the poor's-box ob&s;tructed by a cobweb, are all excellent &s;trokes of &s;atyrical humour.</P>
<P>The fortune, which our adventurer has ju&s;t received, enables him to make one pu&s;h more at the gaming-table. He is exhibited in the &s;ixth print, venting cur&s;es on his folly for having lo&s;t his la&s;t &s;take. &mdash; This is upon the whole perhaps the be&s;t print
<PB N="228" REF="255">
of the &s;et. The horrid &s;cene it de&s;cribes, was never more inimitably drawn. The <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> is artful, and natural. If the &s;hape of the whole be not quite plea&s;ing, the figures are &s;o well grouped, and with &s;o much ea&s;e and variety, that you cannot take of|fence.&mdash;In point of light, it is more culpable. There is not &s;hade enough among the figures to balance the glare. If the neck-cloth, and weep|ers of the gentleman in mourning had been removed, and his hands thrown into &s;hade, even that alone would have improved the effect.&mdash; The <HI>expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> in almo&s;t every figure, is admirable; and the whole is a &s;trong repre&s;entation of the human mind in a &s;torm. Three &s;tages of that &s;pecies of madne&s;s, which at|attends
<PB N="229" REF="256">
gaming, are here de&s;cribed. On the fir&s;t &s;hock, all is inward di&s;|may. The ruined game&s;ter is re|pre&s;ented leaning again&s;t a wall, with his arms acro&s;s, lo&s;t in an agony of horror. Perhaps never pa&s;|&s;ion was de&s;cribed with &s;o much force. In a &s;hort time this horrible gloom bur&s;ts into a &s;torm of fury: he tears in pieces what comes next him; and kneeling down, invokes cur&s;es upon him&s;elf. He next at|tacks others; every one in his turn whom he imagines to have been in|&s;trumental in his ruin.&mdash;The eager joy of the winning game&s;ters, the attention of the u&s;urer, the vehe|mence of the watchman, and the profound reverie of the high-wayman are all admirably marked. There is
<PB N="230" REF="257">
great coolne&s;s too expre&s;&s;ed in the lit|tle we &s;ee of the fat gentleman at the end of the table. The figure oppo&s;ing the mad-man is bad: it has a drunken appearance; and drunken|ne&s;s is not the vice of a gaming-table.&mdash;The principal figure is <HI>ill drawn.</HI> The <HI>per&s;pective</HI> is formal; and the <HI>execution</HI> but indifferent: in heightening his expre&s;&s;ion HO|GARTH has lo&s;t his &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh plate, which gives us the view of a jail, has very little in it. Many of the circum&s;tances, which may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to in|crea&s;e the mi&s;ery of a confined debt|or, are well contrived; but the fruit|ful genius of HOGARTH, I &s;hould think, might have treated the &s;ub|ject
<PB N="231" REF="258">
in a more copious manner. The epi&s;ode of the fainting woman might have given way to many cir|cum&s;tances more proper to the occa|&s;ion. This is the &s;ame woman, whom the rake di&s;cards in the fir&s;t print; by whom he is re&s;cued in the fourth; who is pre&s;ent at his mar|riage; who follows him into jail; and la&s;tly to Bedlam. The thought is rather unnatural, and the moral certainly culpable. &mdash; The <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> is bad. The group of the woman fainting, is a round heavy ma&s;s: and the other group is very ill &s;hapen. The <HI>light</HI> could not be wor&s;e ma|naged; and, as the groups are con|trived, can hardly be improved.&mdash;In the principal figure there is great <HI>expre&s;&s;ion;</HI> and the fainting &s;cene is
<PB N="232" REF="259">
well de&s;cribed.&mdash;A &s;cheme to pay off the national debt by a man who cannot pay his own; and the at|tempt of a &s;illy rake to retrieve his affairs by a work of genius, are admirable &s;trokes of humour.</P>
<P>The eighth plate brings the fortunes of our hero to a conclu&s;ion. It is a very expre&s;&s;ive repre&s;entation of the mo&s;t horrid &s;cene, which human nature can exhibit. &mdash; The <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> is not bad. The group, in which the lunatic is chained, is well managed; and if it had been carried a little further towards the middle of the picture, and the two women, (who &s;eem very odly introduced) had been removed, both the compo&s;ition, and the di&s;tri|bution of light had been good. &mdash;
<PB N="233" REF="260">
The <HI>drawing</HI> of the principal fi|gure is a more accurate piece of ana|tomy, than I &s;hould have expect|ed from HOGARTH. The <HI>expre&s;|&s;ion</HI> of this figure is rather un|meaning; and very inferior to the &s;trong characters of all the other lunatics. The fertile genius of the arti&s;t has introduced as many of the cau&s;es of madne&s;s, as he could well have collected; tho' there is a little tautology. There are two religioni&s;ts, and two a&s;tronomers. Yet there is vari|ety in each; and &s;trong <HI>expre&s;|&s;ion</HI> in all the characters. The &s;elf-&s;atisfaction, and conviction of him, who has di&s;covered the lon|gitude, the mock maje&s;ty of the monarch, the moody melancholy
<PB N="234" REF="261">
of the lover, and the &s;uper&s;titious horror of the popi&s;h devot&eacute;e are all admirable.&mdash;The <HI>per&s;pective</HI> is &s;imple and proper.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">CAUTIONS IN COLLECTING PRINTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE collector of prints may be fir&s;t cautioned again&s;t indulg|ing a de&s;ire to become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>all</HI> the works of any ma&s;ter. There are no ma&s;ters who&s;e works in the
<PB N="236" REF="263">
<HI>gro&s;s</HI> de&s;erve notice. No man is equal to him&s;elf in all his compo&s;itions. I have known a collector of REM|BRANDT ready to give any price for a print or two, which he wanted to compleat his collection; tho' it had been to REMBRANDT'S credit, if tho&s;e prints had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. There is no doubt, but if one third of the works of this ma&s;ter &s;hould be tried by the rules of ju&s;t critici&s;m, they would appear of little value. The great prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> it is &s;aid, was a collector of this kind, and piqued him&s;elf upon having in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>all the works of all the ma&s;ters.</HI> His col|lection was bulky, and co&s;t four&s;core thou&s;and pounds; but when &s;ifted, could not, at that time of day, be worth &s;o many hundreds.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="264">The collector of prints may &s;e|condly be cautioned again&s;t a &s;uper|&s;titious veneration for names. A true judge leaves the <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> out of the que&s;tion, and only examines the <HI>work.</HI> But with a little genius no|thing &s;ways like a great name. It carries a wonderful force; covers glaring faults, and creates imaginary beauties. That &s;pecies of critici&s;m is certainly ju&s;t, which examines the different manners of different ma&s;|ters, with a view to di&s;cover in how many ways a good effect may be pro|duced, and which produces the be&s;t. But to be curious in finding out a ma&s;ter, in order <HI>there</HI> to re&s;t the judgment, is a kind of critici&s;m very paultry, and illiberal. It is judging of the work by the ma&s;ter, in&s;tead
<PB N="238" REF="265">
of judging of the ma&s;ter by the work. Hence it is, that &s;uch vile prints as the <HI>Woman in the cauldron,</HI> and <HI>Mount Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> obtain credit among con|noi&s;&s;eurs. If you a&s;k wherein their beauty con&s;i&s;ts? you are informed, they are engraved by MARK ANTO|NIO: and if that do not &s;atisfy you, you are further a&s;&s;ured, they are after RAPHAEL. This ab&s;urd ta&s;te rai&s;ed an hone&s;t indignation in that ingenious arti&s;t PICART; who hav|ing &s;hewn the world, by his excel|lent imitations, how ridiculous it is to pay a blind veneration to <HI>names,</HI> tells us, that he had compared &s;ome of the engravings of the antient ma&s;|ters with the original pictures, and found them very bad copies. He &s;peaks of the &s;tiffne&s;s, which in ge|neral
<PB N="239" REF="266">
runs through them &mdash; of the hair of children, which re&s;embles pot-hooks &mdash; and of the ignorance of tho&s;e engravers in anatomy, draw|ing, and the di&s;tribution of light.</P>
<P>A third caution, which may be of u&s;e in collecting prints, is, not to rate their value by their <HI>&s;carcene&s;s.</HI> Scarcene&s;s will make a <HI>valuable</HI> print <HI>more</HI> valuable: but to make &s;carce|ne&s;s the &s;tandard of a prints value, is to mi&s;take an accident, for merit. This folly is founded in vanity; and ari&s;es from a de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing what no body el&s;e can po&s;&s;e&s;s. The want of <HI>real</HI> merit is made up by <HI>imagina|ry;</HI> and the object is intended to be <HI>kept,</HI> not <HI>looked at.</HI> Yet ab&s;urd as this fal&s;e ta&s;te is, nothing is more
<PB N="240" REF="267">
common; and a trifling genius may be found, who will give ten guineas for HOLLAR'S &s;hells, which valued according to their real merit, the &s;carcity of them being added to the account are not worth more than as many &s;hil|lings. &mdash; In&s;tances in abundance might be collected of the prevalence of this folly. LE CLERC, in his print of <HI>Alexander's Triumph,</HI> had given a profile of that prince. The print was &s;hewn to the duke of Or|leans, who was plea&s;ed with it on the whole, but ju&s;tly enough objec|ted to the &s;ide-face. The ob&s;equi|ous arti&s;t era&s;ed it, and engraved a full one. A few impre&s;&s;ions had been taken from the plate in its fir&s;t &s;tate, which &s;ell among the cu|rious
<PB N="241" REF="268">
for ten times the price of the impre&s;&s;ions taken after the face was al|tered.&mdash;CALLOT once plea&s;ed with a little plate of his own etching, made an hole in it, through which he drew a ribbon, and wore it at his button. The impre&s;&s;ions after the hole was made, are very &s;carce, and amazingly valuable.&mdash;VANDYKE etched a print of the holy family, in which St. John was repre&s;ented lay|ing his hand upon the virgin's &s;houl|der. The print, before it was pub|li&s;hed, was &s;hewn among his critical friends, &s;ome of whom thought the action of St. John too familiar. The painter was convinced, and removed the hand. But he was mi&s;taken, when he thought he added value to his print by the alteration. The im|pre&s;&s;ions, which got abroad with
<PB N="242" REF="269">
the hand upon the &s;houlder, would buy up all the re&s;t, three times over, in any auction in London.&mdash;Many of REMBRANDT'S prints receive in|finite value from little accidental al|terations of this kind. A few im|pre&s;&s;ions were taken from one plate, before a dog was introduced; from another, before a white hor&s;e-tail was turned into a black one; from a third, before a &s;ign-po&s;t was in&s;ert|ed at an ale-hou&s;e door: and all the &s;carce prints from the&s;e plates, tho' altered for the better, are the prints of value: the re&s;t are common and cheap.&mdash;I &s;hall conclude the&s;e in|&s;tances with a &s;tory of a late cele|brated collector of pictures. He was &s;hewing his collection with great &s;a|tisfaction; and after expatiating up|on many noble works by GUIDO,
<PB N="243" REF="270">
MARRATTI, and other ma&s;ters, he turned &s;uddenly to the gentleman, whom he attended; and, "Now, Sir, &s;aid he, I'll &s;hew you a real curio&s;i|ty: there is a WOVERMAN without a hor&s;e in it."&mdash;The circum&s;tance, it is true, was uncommon; but was unluckily that very circum&s;tance, which made the picture of little value.</P>
<P>Let the collector of prints be cau|tioned, fourthly, to beware of buy|ing copies for originals. Mo&s;t of the works of the capital ma&s;ters have been copied; and many of them &s;o well, that if a per&s;on be not ver&s;ed in prints, he may ea&s;ily be deceived. Were the copies really as good as the originals, the name would &s;ig|nify
<PB N="244" REF="271">
nothing: but, like tran&s;lations, they nece&s;&s;arily fall &s;hort of the &s;pi|rit of the original; and contract a &s;tiffne&s;s from the fear of erring. When &s;een apart, they look well; but when compared with the origi|nals, the difference ea&s;ily appears. Thus CALLOT<HI>'s beggars</HI> have been &s;o well copied, that the difference be|tween the originals and the copies would not immediately &s;trike you; but when you compare them, it is obvious. There is a plain want of freedom; the characters are le&s;s &s;trongly marked; and the extremi|ties are le&s;s accurately touched.&mdash;It is a difficult matter to give rules to a&s;|&s;i&s;t in di&s;tingui&s;hing the copy from the original. In mo&s;t ca&s;es the en|graver's name, or his mark (which
<PB N="245" REF="272">
&s;hould be well known) will be a &s;uf|ficient direction. The&s;e the copyi&s;t is &s;eldom hardy enough to forge. But in anonymous prints it is matter of more difficulty. All that can be done is, to attend carefully to the <HI>freedom</HI> of the <HI>manner,</HI> in the <HI>ex|tremities</HI> e&s;pecially, in which the copyi&s;t is more liable to fail. When you are pretty well acquainted with the <HI>manner</HI> of a ma&s;ter, you cannot well be deceived. When you are not, your be&s;t way is to be directed by tho&s;e who are.</P>
<P>The la&s;t caution I &s;hall give to the collector of prints, is, to take care he purcha&s;e not bad impre&s;&s;ions.&mdash; There are three things which make an impre&s;&s;ion bad. &mdash;The fir&s;t is, it's
<PB N="246" REF="273">
being <HI>ill taken off.</HI> Some prints &s;eem to have received the force of the roller at intervals. The impre&s;&s;i|on is double; and gives that glimmer|ing appearance, which illudes the eye.&mdash;A &s;econd thing, which makes an impre&s;&s;ion bad, is <HI>a worn plate.</HI> There is as much difference between the fir&s;t and the la&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame plate, as between two different prints. The <HI>effect</HI> is wholly lo&s;t in a faint impre&s;&s;ion; and you have nothing left but a vapid de&s;ign without &s;pirit, and without force. In metzotinto e&s;pecially a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion is de&s;ireable. For the &s;pirit of a metzotinto quickly eva|porates; without which it is the mo&s;t in&s;ipid of all prints. In en|graving and etching there will be
<PB N="247" REF="274">
always here and there a dark touch, which long pre&s;erves an appearance of &s;pirit: but metzotinto is a flat &s;urface; and when it begins to wear, it wears <HI>all over.</HI> Too ma|ny of the works of all the great ma&s;ters, which are commonly hawk|ed about at auctions, or &s;old in &s;hops, are in this wretched &s;tate. It is difficult to meet with a good impre&s;&s;ion. The SALVATORS, REM|BRANDTS, and WATERLOS, which we meet with now, except here and there, in &s;ome choice collection, are &s;eldom better than mere rever&s;es. You &s;ee the form of the print; but the elegant, and ma&s;terly touches are gone; back-grounds and fore-grounds are jumbled together by the confu&s;ion of all di&s;tance; and you
<PB N="248" REF="275">
have rather the &s;hadow of a print left, than the print it&s;elf. &mdash;The la&s;t thing which makes a bad impre&s;&s;i|on, is <HI>retouching a worn plate.</HI> Sometimes this is performed by the ma&s;ter him&s;elf; and then the &s;pirit of the impre&s;&s;ion may be &s;till pre&s;er|ved. But mo&s;t commonly the re|touching part is done by &s;ome bungler, into who&s;e hands the plate has fallen; and then it is mo&s;t exe|crable. In a <HI>worn</HI> plate, at lea&s;t what you have is good: you have the remains of &s;omething excellent; and if you are ver&s;ed in the works of the ma&s;ter, your imagination may be agreeably exerci&s;ed in making out what is lo&s;t. But when the plate has gone through the hands of a bungler, who has worked it over
<PB N="249" REF="276">
with his infamous &s;cratches, the idea of the ma&s;ter is lo&s;t; and you have nothing left, but &s;trong, har&s;h, and unmeaning lines upon a faint ground; which is the mo&s;t di&s;agree|able compound, with which the eye can be pre&s;ented. Such prints, and many &s;uch there are, though offer|ed us under the name of REM|BRANDT, or WATERLO, are of lit|tle value. Tho&s;e ma&s;ters would not have owned &s;uch works.&mdash;Yet, as we are often obliged to take up with &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions, as we can get; let us rather chu&s;e the <HI>faint</HI> impre&s;&s;ion, than the <HI>retouched</HI> one.</P>
