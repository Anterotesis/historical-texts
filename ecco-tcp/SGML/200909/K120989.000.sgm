<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the art of Painting is not unju&s;tly ranked in the humble cla&s;s of imitative arts cannot be denied; but, were this its only claim to the attention of mankind, it would hardly be allowed the privilege of being called the &s;i&s;ter of Poetry, and it is therefore evident that the rank, thus a&s;&s;igned to it, can refer only to the mechanical part, the <HI>language,</HI> as it may be termed, of the <HI>art;</HI> the <HI>means,</HI> and not the <HI>end;</HI> which bear nearly the &s;ame affinity to the genius and e&s;&s;ence of painting, as the &s;kill of the writing-ma&s;ter does to the mu&s;e of the poet. The various powers of paint|ing, like Ae&s;op's di&s;h of tongues, may, ac|cording to the management of them, be|come
<PB N="ii" REF="4">come the in&s;truments of the be&s;t or of the wor&s;t purpo&s;es. Painting addre&s;&s;es it&s;elf to our noble&s;t faculties, and makes the highe&s;t preten&s;ions: it is able to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions, delight the imagination, and correct the heart.</P>
<P>It may, with &s;ome, become a &s;ubject of doubt, whether the le&s;&s;ons of virtue are better enforced by the exhibition of grand and rare events, or the more humble and familiar circum&s;tances of daily life: but a little reflection will a&s;certain, that, though the former may fill the mind for a while with tumult and a&s;toni&s;hment, they, for the mo&s;t part, leave untouched the affections of the heart, which the latter are calculated to enchain with irre&s;i&s;tible intere&s;t, and, by that channel, to diffu&s;e in&s;truction more widely through the various ranks of &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5">The author of the Rambler has ob&s;erved, that the downfal of kingdoms and revolu|tions of empires afford few le&s;&s;ons applica|ble to private life, the comfort or wretched|ne&s;s of which flows from the right or wrong management of things, which are made con&s;iderable only by their frequency; that the mi&s;chievous con&s;equences of irre|gular de&s;ires and predominant pa&s;&s;ions are be&s;t di&s;covered in tho&s;e &s;cenes, which are le|velled to the general &s;urface of the world, and which &s;hew, in natural and familiar in&s;tances, by what means mi&s;ery pur&s;ues guilt, that virtue is the highe&s;t proof of under&s;tanding, and that vice is the natural con&s;equence of narrow thoughts, that it begins in mi&s;take and ends in infamy.</P>
<P>The following &s;eries of de&s;igns has been con&s;tructed for the entertainment of young minds, <Q>ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="iv" REF="6">not fixed by principles, and therefore following the current of fancy,</Q> to whom the familiar objects, which it pre|&s;ents, may be productive of greater good than the &s;olemnities of more &s;tately exam|ples. And it may be hoped, that, by di&s;|playing with circum&s;pection the natural contingencies of life, they will be &s;een in future with le&s;s hazard by the incautious and unexperienced, encourage to virtue, and warn from the delu&s;ive path of vice, which invariably leads to mi&s;ery.</P>

<P>IT is the purpo&s;e, as we have already ob&s;erved, of the following &s;eries of Pictures, to place in the &s;tronge&s;t light the probable con&s;equences of GOOD and BAD CONDUCT merely in this life. No|thing &s;o fully impre&s;&s;es the mind as EXAMPLE; and therefore two characters are cho&s;en from a large cla&s;s of &s;ociety, in order to render the moral more exten&s;ively u&s;eful. But, though the characters are thus &s;elected from one order of the community, the
<PB N="6" REF="8">moral is not confined to that order; for every per&s;on, in any other &s;tate, may apply the le&s;&s;on at home, learn to avoid &s;uch conduct as nece&s;&s;arily leads to the lo&s;s of fortune and reputation, and, on the other hand, to act upon &s;uch principles as tend to rai&s;e the e&s;teem of mankind, and, con&s;equently, to procure their favour and protection. The exam|ples, held forth in this work, con&s;i&s;t of two FEMALE SERVANTS, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to live in the hou&s;e of a young unmarried man of fortune. They are con|ceived to be of an equal age, and upon a level with re&s;pect to &s;ituation, talents, and per&s;onal attrac|tions. One, however, acts uniformly from motives of prudence, delicacy, and virtue; the other is carele&s;s, di&s;&s;ipated, and inclined to immoral gratifi|cations. The progre&s;s of their conduct, and the fi|nal re&s;ult, illu&s;trate that homely, but important, axiom in morals, <Q>"HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY."</Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t picture unfolds, in &s;ome degree, the characters of the heroines of this graphic drama. The GOOD SERVANT is indu&s;triou&s;ly employed in the proper duties of her &s;tation. The circum&s;tances, in which &s;he is placed, manife&s;t order and economy, and di&s;play her natural di&s;po&s;ition. The almanack implies that her time is always properly a&s;&s;igned to her re&s;pective duties. The introduction of the ant and the gra&s;shopper is &s;ymbolical of the two cha|racters;
<PB N="7" REF="9">which are al&s;o indicated by the picture over the door, repre&s;enting the parable of the wi&s;e and fooli&s;h virgins.&mdash;The BAD SERVANT, a giddy wan|ton girl, in&s;tead of minding her work, is playing; and the confu&s;ion and di&s;order, with which &s;he is &s;urrounded, afford an unpromi&s;ing &s;pecimen of her future behaviour. The &s;cheme of the lottery, above her head, &s;hews that her mind is filled with fooli&s;h hopes of fortuitous pro&s;perity, and that &s;he is not likely to adopt the proper means for &s;ecuring a &s;itu|ation of permanent comfort and re&s;pectability. She is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a <HI>coquette</HI> in her cla&s;s; con&s;equently, all the men-&s;ervants, who are toying with her, e|qually &s;hare in her favours, and naturally take liber|ties, where they meet with encouragement. The prudent old hou&s;ekeeper, from a convenient &s;ta|tion, ob&s;erves the whole, and expre&s;&s;es a compa&s;|&s;ionate foreboding of the melancholy effects likely to re&s;ult from &s;uch heedle&s;s proceedings. Hence may be inferred how nece&s;&s;ary it is to check the fir&s;t tendency to immoral pur&s;uits, le&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould be rendered &s;tronger by indulgence, till they lead the profligate to the la&s;t exce&s;&s;es of vice and infamy.</P>

<P>THE next &s;cene of our moral drama exhibits the heroines of the piece acting according to the qualities, which form the di&s;tingui&s;hing features of their re&s;pective characters. The hou&s;ekeeper, be|nevolent from nature, and wi&s;e from experience, an|xious to direct the unwary &s;ervant towards the paths of virtue, and to confirm the well-di&s;po&s;ed girl in tho&s;e good intentions which appear to guide her conduct,
<PB N="10" REF="11">is delivering &s;uch exhortations as ob&s;ervation and a knowledge of the &s;nares, that over&s;pread life, natu|rally enforce. The girls are &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the hou&s;ekeeper's room, called thither for the purpo&s;e of li&s;tening, undi&s;turbed by the ridicule of the male|&s;ervants, to the le&s;&s;ons of experience. And here we &s;ee a con&s;picuous proof of the feelings, that are likely to influence their future lives.&mdash;The amiable girl is meekly lending an attentive ear to the remarks of the &s;age and benevolent hou&s;ekeeper, as if &s;he hoped to derive from the di&s;cour&s;e &s;uch a plan of behaviour, as may &s;ecure the approbation of her own con&s;cience, and lead her through a life of innocence and tranquillity.&mdash;The other girl, compelled to at|tend to a lecture repugnant to her feelings, can hardly pre&s;erve even the outward marks of deco|rum, but &s;hews, by a li&s;tle&s;s yawn, that &s;he is deaf to all admonition, which may contradict the pa&s;&s;ions &s;he is inclined to indulge, though mi&s;ery and ruin &s;hould be the inevitable con&s;equences. Her hand, indeed, &s;eems to be lifted towards her mouth, as if to conceal the effect of a di&s;cour&s;e which &s;he thinks tedious; but the manner of the action &s;hews, that it is rather the re&s;ult of habit than dictated by any regard to civility. The di&s;order of her dre&s;s, in perfect oppo&s;ition to the near attire of her fellow-&s;ervant, and the negligence of her attitude, contri|bute to develop the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of her character; while the pocket-gla&s;s, which &s;he has carele&s;&s;ly
<PB N="11" REF="12">dropped, completes the portrait of vanity and folly. &mdash; The china-clo&s;et, the books on the &s;helf, the de|cayed finery of the chairs, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be di&s;carded from better apartments, all indicate, as we &s;aid, the room of the hou&s;ekeeper; a place, where advice could be given with the lea&s;t chance of interruption.</P>

<P>THE &s;cene now repre&s;ented may be con&s;idered as the natural con&s;equence of what appeared in the two former pictures, relative to the character of the bad &s;ervant. Wholly devoted to the impul&s;e of unruly pa&s;&s;ions, &s;he no longer guards her door from the inva&s;ions of the midnight libertine; but, being now become the &s;lave of appetite, meditates only the means of gratifying it. Her bed-room is
<PB N="14" REF="14">in di&s;order, and her clothes &s;cattered around in care|le&s;s negligence. The decorations of her apparel manife&s;t the corruptne&s;s of her ta&s;te and the irregu|larity of her de&s;ires; and the papers, which &s;he has cho&s;en as ornaments to her room, or rather as in|centives to her mi&s;guided imagination, demon&s;trate her thoughts to have been more employed on &s;uch fallacious artifices as &s;he thinks may add allurements to her per&s;on, than on the &s;olid attainments, which may make her a de&s;irable companion for life. A|mong&s;t the&s;e we likewi&s;e di&s;cover the portrait of one, whom &s;he admired as a man of &s;pirit. Devo|ted to loo&s;e novels or idle love-letters, &s;he appears to have endangered the hou&s;e by her nocturnal &s;tu|dies, as is evidently &s;een by the &s;moke of a candle again&s;t the wall. Her garters di&s;play a love-motto, and the hat of her lover, in the corner, denotes that he is familiar to her apartment; where he is now conceived to be a con&s;tant vi&s;itor when the re&s;t of the family have retired to repo&s;e. The pride and folly of her character is &s;till farther ob&s;ervable in the name of <HI>Eliza,</HI> appended to one of her letters dropped upon the pillow; and which, taught by &s;ome of her &s;illy romances, &s;he has cho&s;en as a more elegant appellation, and one more &s;uitable to her ambitious hopes, than the vulgar name of <HI>Betty,</HI> by which &s;he imagines her&s;elf degraded in her do|me&s;tic &s;ituation. After this general appearance of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and &s;en&s;uality, it is no wonder to find,
<PB N="15" REF="15">that her lover is &s;tealing into her apartment; or that, in waiting for him, &s;he &s;inks into &s;lumbers, over which the images of her waking fancy &s;till appear to pre&s;ide.</P>

<P>WE have here a &s;triking and intere&s;ting con|tra&s;t to the &s;ubject of the la&s;t &s;cene.

<PB N="18" REF="17">of religion, there is no appearance of gloomy me|lancholy or frantic enthu&s;ia&s;m. Her con&s;cience is wholly exempt from <Q>the compunctious vi&s;itings of nature;</Q> and, as her life is pure, her devotion is &s;imple. The mild radiance of the &s;ilver moon, which appears through the window, gives a plea&s;ing &s;olemnity to the &s;cene, and is &s;ymbolical of the cha&s;tity that marks the character of our good girl. The &s;tate of the room &s;hews the regularity of her manners; the &s;ampler, worked by her&s;elf, contain|ing the <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> the <HI>twelve good rules</HI> of King Charles the Fir&s;t; a paper, inculcating the <HI>duty of &s;ervants</HI> to their employers; the <HI>Prayer-book;</HI> and the <HI>Young Man's be&s;t Companion;</HI> all tend to &s;hew, that her feelings take a moral direction in every pur&s;uit; and the print of <HI>connubial happine&s;s</HI> indicates a well-regulated di&s;po&s;ition to &s;upport the proper duties of a wife, when it &s;hall plea&s;e Provi|dence to place her in that &s;ituation. Finally, the bolting of the door &s;hews that &s;he is prepared a|gain&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of the midnight libertine, who might rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to inhabit a man&s;ion, where temptation and encouragement were &s;o gro&s;&s;ly held forth in the conduct of her profligate fellow|&s;ervant.

<P>HITHERTO our young wanton, however mi&s;guided her de&s;ires may have been, howe|ver unfortunate the tendency of her conduct, has &s;ound nothing to check the indulgence of her wi&s;hes, or the &s;ucce&s;s of her youthful projects. We are now come to a period, where the &s;cale begins to turn again&s;t her, and where in&s;truction a&s;&s;umes a graver tone. The bitterne&s;s of &s;orrow, which &s;uc|ceeds
<PB N="22" REF="20">immoral plea&s;ures, now forces it&s;elf on her heart. She perceives at once the fatal delu&s;ion of tho&s;e dazzling allurements, which, glittering for a moment, and gaudy, like the colours of the rainbow, like tho&s;e, are vani&s;hed and di&s;&s;olved in tears.</P>

<BIBL>LOVE's VICTIMS.</BIBL></Q>
<P>The irregularities of this thoughtle&s;s girl having been detected by the vigilance of the attentive hou&s;ekeeper, &s;he is now di&s;carded with ju&s;t di&s;|grace, and turned out upon a world, ever more in|clined to in&s;ult than pity the victims of imprudence; and &s;he has thus, by her own mi&s;conduct, totally forfeited the protection of a re&s;pectable and friendly man&s;ion, which might otherwi&s;e have been her con&s;tant &s;helter and comfort through the whole cour&s;e of her life. On which-ever &s;ide &s;he <HI>here</HI> ca&s;ts her eye, the objects it meets may be readily con|&s;trued into omens of her future fate; on one, is pre|&s;ented a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing in&s;tance of want and wretchedne&s;s; and, on the other, a &s;cene of the mo&s;t brutal de|pravity. As &s;he pa&s;&s;es along, &s;he is &s;tung by the in&s;ulting &s;coffs and jeerings of her very a&s;&s;ociates, on whom &s;he has lavi&s;hed the unguarded dower of innocence; and who, untouched with pity for the degraded &s;ituation, to which they have contributed to
<PB N="23" REF="21">reduce her, now crowd the window to mock her &s;orrows. She has the mortification to find that the only per&s;ons, who &s;till regard her with compa&s;&s;ion, are tho&s;e whom &s;he before con&s;idered as enemies to her happine&s;s, or, at be&s;t, as ill-natured &s;pies on her conduct. Happy for her, (but &s;he now per|ceives it too late,) if &s;he had been warned by tho&s;e &s;alutary reproofs, of which the intent and effort were to recall her from error, re&s;cue her from danger, and avert the evil which has now fallen on her head.</P>
<P>With the little &s;tock of her remaining apparel, and the more weighty evidence of her pa&s;t mi&s;con|duct, &s;he takes a melancholy, &s;olitary leave of her late happy abode, to which &s;he dares not look back. &mdash; The amiable girl, &s;o lately her companion, has attended her to the door, and expre&s;&s;es for her that compa&s;&s;ion, which the view of mi&s;ery, however merited, always excites in a tender and feeling mind. Con&s;cious of her unavailing regret, &s;he hides her &s;orrows on the neck of her revered protectre&s;s and guardian, who &s;tretches out her hand to be&s;tow on the parting &s;teps of the wretched wanderer a la&s;t and fruitle&s;s benediction.</P>

Her ma&s;ter, a gentleman in the bloom of youth, recommended by an agreeable per&s;on, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a fortune capable of &s;upporting her in luxury and &s;plendor, if &s;he could be wrought to li&s;ten to his licentious

The di&s;order, that appears in her dre&s;s, &s;hews that he has been rude in his attacks; but, finding that he was repelled with all the firm|ne&s;s of virtuous indignation, he has recour&s;e to the milder expedient of per&s;ua&s;ion, and has even been induced, by the eagerne&s;s of his wi&s;hes, to the conde&s;cen&s;ion of kneeling, in order to &s;often and &s;ubdue her mode&s;t re&s;olutions. All his efforts however are in vain, and produce no other effect than to make her turn weeping out of the room, at the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being &s;ubject to &s;uch an in|dignity becau&s;e &s;he is in a &s;ervile &s;ituation, and therefore &s;uppo&s;ed incapable of a high &s;en&s;e of ho|nour. This conduct, were the mind altogether depraved, might be expected to excite a &s;pirit of re&s;entment in her ma&s;ter, that would have ended in the lo&s;s of her place, if her own delicacy did not induce her to withdraw from a &s;cene of &s;uch an in&s;ult: but her ma&s;ter, though betrayed by tem|porary pa&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as the di&s;&s;ipation of modern manners is too apt to &s;timulate and encourage, is a man of &s;en&s;e and feeling, and therefore is likely, on reflection, to view our heroine with &s;entiments of re&s;pect and a nobler admiration. &mdash; Here, as in the foregoing &s;cenes, the embelli&s;hments of the
<PB N="27" REF="24">room bear clo&s;e analogy to characters and events, and tend to illu&s;trate the main de&s;ign. Cupid, on the chimney-piece, is di&s;charging an arrow, the point of which is directed to the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, while he is in his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;tate of liber|tine entreaty. In another part, Cupid is &s;een a&s;tride upon a lion, expre&s;&s;ive of the power of <HI>love</HI> over <HI>&s;trength.</HI> The Janus-head &s;hews, in front, the face of Cupid, and, behind, that of a &s;atyr; implying that love is too often u&s;ed as the di&s;gui&s;e to a pa&s;|&s;ion of a much gro&s;&s;er nature. The allegorical picture above, repre&s;enting Time di&s;covering Truth, is to be con&s;idered as an au&s;picious omen of the recompen&s;e that waits on virtue.</P>

<P>FROM the engaging &s;cene of an unaffected and genuine mode&s;ty, which the &s;olicitations of youth, wealth, and per&s;ua&s;ion, were unable to van|qui&s;h, we now turn our eyes to a picture of a totally different nature. Here the ra&s;h and deluded wan|ton, elevated, as &s;he fal&s;ely conceives, to the height of good fortune, encouraged and care&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e, who&s;e pre&s;ent gratifications are intere&s;ted in &s;eclu|ding
<PB N="30" REF="26">her entirely from reputation and virtue, aban|dons her&s;elf, amid&s;t the mo&s;t profligate of either &s;ex, to the wilde&s;t tumults of riot and debauchery. That no galling remor&s;e may &s;teal in to fru&s;trate the indulgence of licentious pa&s;&s;ion, &s;en&s;e and re|flection are previou&s;ly drowned in intoxicating li|quors, while the various luxuries of the table (now overturned before them) &s;hew that every means, prodigality could devi&s;e, has been eagerly employed to &s;creen this abode of revelry from the painful return of rea&s;on and recollection, which, like the golden beam of day, lighting the vault of the dead, would but have &s;erved to di&s;cover the hideous ob|jects it contains. We &s;ee our heroine be&s;towing the di&s;ordered care&s;&s;es of intoxication on her pa|ramour, who is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the apparatus of a highwayman, and who is on the eve of paying the forfeit of his depredations on the public. She lifts an ill-poi&s;ed bumper over his head, and drinks to his fortunate e&s;cape from the perils which are now evidently impending, while one of her fe|male companions, equally depraved and abandoned as her&s;elf, in a fit of drunken jealou&s;y, threatens to tear her, by violence, from the arms of this favorite de&s;perado. In the mean time, the noi&s;y roar of their di&s;orderly mirth has attracted the ob|&s;ervation of the con&s;table of the night, who, at|tended by watchmen, link-boys, and a mob of various de&s;cription, has forced his way into the
<PB N="31" REF="27">riotous a&s;&s;embly, to the no &s;mall con&s;ternation and di&s;may of tho&s;e few in it, who are &s;till able to form a competent judgement of their own danger. One of the&s;e is &s;een hiding him&s;elf under the table, in order to watch a convenient opportunity of e&s;ca|ping, and another attempts to get up the chimney, with the &s;ame intent. The landlady of the hou&s;e appears alarmed for the credit of her man&s;ion, in which &s;he fears, not without rea&s;on, that her own may be eventually implicated. Fear however is by no means the predominant expre&s;&s;ion of the company. Several are re&s;olute in re&s;i&s;tance of the lawful guardians of the night, and threaten to fire on tho&s;e who attempt to &s;eize them. One, &s;till awake to the u&s;ual employment of his more &s;ober thoughts, is bu&s;ied in &s;ecuring to him&s;elf the de&s;erted &s;takes of the gaming-table; while another, under pre|tence of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the female combatant, whom we have mentioned, is attentive to the opportunity of purloining her watch and trinkets from her &s;ide: ju&s;t emblems of the friend&s;hip of &s;uch profligates, who&s;e union is cemented only by con&s;piracies of mi&s;chief. The remaining gue&s;ts appear totally lo&s;t in the delirium of drunkenne&s;s, and one, more ea|&s;ily vanqui&s;hed and more unfortunate than the re&s;t, is lying in &s;en&s;ele&s;s intoxication on the floor, while a pi&s;tol, on the lock of which the candle has ju&s;t fallen, threatens him with in&s;tant de&s;truction.</P>

<P>TO relieve the mind from the painful emotions naturally ari&s;ing from the la&s;t di&s;orderly &s;cene, we are here pre&s;ented with an earne&s;t of the happi|ne&s;s which our GOOD SERVANT is going to receive, as a reward for the virtue &s;he has pre&s;erved from the contagion of example and the &s;nares of tempta|tion. Her ma&s;ter has found it impo&s;&s;ible to efface the impre&s;&s;ion of her per&s;onal attractions; and, as
<PB N="34" REF="30">the uniform propriety of her conduct has added e&s;|teem to his love, after an ineffectual conte&s;t, main|tained by his pride and the prejudices connected with the &s;uperiority of his fortune and rank, he has at la&s;t determined not to "barter happine&s;s for &s;tate," but to rai&s;e the object of his de&s;ires to a &s;ituation, to which her virtues give her a ju&s;t claim, and which her many excellent qualities may rea&s;onably be expected to adorn. To obviate therefore all &s;u&s;picion of any di&s;honourable artifice, which his former libertine a&s;&s;aults might induce her to appre|hend, he has called her into his library, and has or|dered the venerable hou&s;ekeeper to attend as a wit|ne&s;s of his formal offer of his hand in marriage. Young, hand&s;ome, and wealthy, it is natural to conceive that our heroine mu&s;t have looked upon her ma&s;ter with feelings of regard, though re&s;train|ed by humility, re&s;ulting from reflection on the di&s;|parity of their conditions; and &s;uch a &s;entiment tends to enhance the merit of her former re&s;i&s;tance. Nor is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the licentious advances, he made towards her, have excited an unconquera|ble re&s;entment, &s;ince they have been &s;ucceeded by re&s;pect and the ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of her real value. The various emotions of &s;urprize, mode&s;ty, plea&s;ure, and gratitude, operate &s;o forcibly, that &s;he throws her&s;elf upon her knees; but is rai&s;ed by her ma&s;ter, who ki&s;&s;es her trembling hand with ec&s;ta&s;y, while the friendly hou&s;ekeeper is in an attitude of pious
<PB N="35" REF="31">acknowledgement to heaven for thus recompen&s;ing that goodne&s;s, which her maternal care and con|&s;tant admonitions had contributed to direct and confirm. &mdash; The ornamental part of this plate is &s;till &s;ubordinate and acce&s;&s;ory to the object generally in view. Several pictures adorn the room. That fir&s;t entitled to our notice is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fa|mous work of GUIDO; the &s;ubject of which is, LIBERALITY rewarding MODESTY. The next re|pre&s;ents the triumph of love over a &s;atyr; by which we are of cour&s;e to under&s;tand, that the impul&s;e of a brutal inclination has given way to a refined &s;enti|ment of virtuous tenderne&s;s. Another picture re|pre&s;ents a wedding, and, near it, is one of an allego|rical kind, exhibiting the SEASONS dancing in a ring, while TIME is acting as mu&s;ician; implying the continued happine&s;s that is to be expected from an union of hearts, in which no &s;ordid views of in|tere&s;t have had the lea&s;t &s;hare. The next picture is partly hid behind the door, to &s;ignify the awful my&s;tery that veils a future &s;tate; but, as the &s;ubject is an angelic ho&s;t, we are to infer, that bli&s;s in ano|ther life is to be the final lot of tho&s;e who conduct them&s;elves properly through the pre&s;ent. The pic|ture of a &s;torm is placed behind the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, to indicate the &s;truggles he &s;uffered, while pride was contending with love in his heart; but the mental tempe&s;t has now pa&s;&s;ed away, as we &s;ee far|ther exemplified by the picture of a calm on the

<P>THE &s;cenes, which we have hitherto contem|plated, have progre&s;&s;ively led us to one of the mo&s;t affecting nature, in which we at length be|hold the unhappy victim of vice and delu&s;ion arrived
<PB N="38" REF="35">at a cata&s;trophe as mi&s;erable as the tenor of her life has been erroneous: &s;uch indeed as is the natu|ral effect of the conduct we have before witne&s;&s;ed, and &s;uch as on a moment's recollection we &s;hall perceive to be more immediately the con&s;equence of the unhappy &s;tate of riot and debauchery in which we la&s;t left her.</P>
<P>The &s;plendor of vanity, the intemperance of laughter, the feveri&s;h triumph of pre&s;umption and heedle&s;s arrogance, are cea&s;ed. While the wanton flew headlong and irrevocably through the paths which plea&s;ure has &s;trewed with blo&s;&s;oms torn rude|ly from the &s;talk, &s;he was not aware that poverty and di&s;ea&s;e lurked on her way; they have a&s;&s;ailed her, they have &s;eized her, they have laden her with angui&s;h, which &s;he was equally unprepared and una|ble to &s;upport, and the &s;ufferings of a di&s;tempered frame are at la&s;t about to be clo&s;ed in death.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;cene exhibits the poor friendle&s;s pro&s;titute in the agonies of expiring life, de&s;titute of every means of relief, and wanting all tho&s;e con&s;o|lations and &s;upports, which in this awful period at|tend the virtuous. An outca&s;t from &s;ociety, which &s;he has di&s;honoured; bani&s;hed from that humanity and benevolence, who&s;e protection &s;he has forfeited; to whom in this hour of extreme nece&s;&s;ity does &s;he con&s;ign her&s;elf, to watch the painful moments of
<PB N="39" REF="36">her di&s;&s;olution? The mini&s;ter of this charge, <Q>fit watch in &s;uch a night,</Q> is before us. A wretch, in whom, hardened by being a continual witne&s;s of &s;uch &s;cenes of mi&s;ery, every ve&s;tige of feeling ap|pears to be finally extingui&s;hed. Callous to the an|gui&s;h &s;he was hired to relieve, in&s;tead of attending to the pitiable object of her care, a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly inqui|ring her wants, or admini&s;tering comfort to her la&s;t moments, her only &s;olicitude appears to have been habitually directed to her&s;elf. Her body &s;weltering and bloated with gluttony, the dram and cordial "&s;tanding rubrick" on her cheek, this mi&s;creant, wholly inebriated, &s;nores over the exhau&s;ted flaggon, while the lamentable victim of more fatal imprudence, dropping the phial of unavailing medicine, expires unnoticed at her feet. &mdash; Such is inevitably the mi|&s;erable exit of tho&s;e, whom a di&s;graceful and an ill|&s;pent life leaves di&s;regarded and forlorn in death.</P>
<P>In a gloomy chamber, near who&s;e door a rope, &s;u&s;pended from the roof, reminds us of &s;ome former &s;ufferer, who has &s;ought relief in &s;uicide, we be|hold our unfortunate heroine, lying on a ruined floor, with no other bed than a little &s;traw, while the fragments of a wretched meal and the tattered remnants of her former gaiety, a faded feather, hat, and cloak, are &s;trewed on the ground around her, and at her &s;ide a poor little innocent, ignorant of its pitiable &s;ituation, embraces with filial tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="40" REF="37">his cold and lifele&s;s mother, on who&s;e ear the la&s;t &s;ounds that vibrated, were the cries of this her now de&s;titute and helple&s;s orphan.</P>
<P>From objects, the one &s;o affecting, the other &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting, we &s;hould &s;hrink at once with terror, if our attention were not more plea&s;ingly drawn to the engaging and now doubly-intere&s;ting appearance of the former amiable friend and companion, who, though too late to afford the relief that would have gratified her tender heart, has &s;ought out the gloo|my retreat of poverty and &s;hame; and, overcome with grief at the &s;ight which pre&s;ents it&s;elf to her, wipes from her eyes the tears that fall for the &s;uffer|ings of a fellow-creature; <Q>"Tears, from &s;weet Virtue's &s;ource, benevolent to all."</Q></P>
<P>Prepared to offer every means of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he has filled her frugal pur&s;e with the &s;avings of her own indu&s;try, and the larger bounty which her en|treaties, ever the ready advocates of di&s;tre&s;s, have obtained from the worthy and benevolent hou&s;e|keeper. In the hurry of taking her pur&s;e from her pocket, &s;he has dropped her <HI>hou&s;ewife;</HI> which be|ing ob&s;erved by the little me&s;&s;enger of gluttony, ju&s;t returning to the old nur&s;e with a fre&s;h &s;upply of her favourite cordial, accu&s;tomed to watch the op|portunities of knavery, he is artfully employed in
<PB N="41" REF="38">drawing it, by means of a crooked &s;tick, towards the door, behind which he hides him&s;elf during the commi&s;&s;ion of the theft. A melancholy pre|&s;age of that ruinous cour&s;e of life, which mu&s;t bring him to the mo&s;t fatal and di&s;graceful end.&mdash;The principal intention of the &s;cene, exhibited to us in this picture, may be more forcibly impre&s;&s;ed by the following lines:</P>

<P>AS in the la&s;t &s;cene was ended the life of one, the di&s;a&s;trous heroine of the&s;e de&s;igns, in the pre&s;ent, the other, the <HI>good girl,</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have received a reward acquired by virtuous per&s;everance in her duty, and is become the wife of
<PB N="44" REF="40">a man, in whom the &s;trict propriety of her beha|viour has changed illicit de&s;ire into re&s;pect and love; and we are thus arrived at the conclu&s;ion of our moral drama. The hand of the wealthy and gene|rous ma&s;ter atones for the indi&s;cretion which had &s;erved to prove the virtues of this child of mode&s;|ty; and &s;he is, in the bloom of life, rai&s;ed to a &s;tate of affluence, and placed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that promi&s;es the utmo&s;t happine&s;s in this world. After mutual faith plighted at the altar, the ena|moured bridegroom conducts her to his carriage, and her old friend and guardian, the benevolent hou&s;ekeeper, enjoys the heartfelt &s;atisfaction of &s;ee|ing her pious admonitions thus &s;ingularly recom|pen&s;ed.</P>
<P>While, on one &s;ide of this picture, &s;o bright a pro&s;pect opens it&s;elf before us, on the other, we &s;ee the la&s;t &s;ad offices paid to the remains of the once gay, healthy, and beautiful wanton. The clergy|man, &s;till intere&s;ted in the happine&s;s of the young couple, who&s;e hands he has joined, advances to per|form the &s;olemn rites: but his &s;acred character is not &s;ufficient to in&s;pire in the attendants of the fu|neral that decency which the occa&s;ion &s;urely de|mands. The co&s;&s;in is &s;urrounded by the former comrades of the decea&s;ed, among&s;t which the drunken nur&s;e, who was pre&s;ent at her la&s;t mo|ments, is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame intemperance
<PB N="45" REF="41">that before marked her character; to the indulgence of which all times and all circum&s;tances are, under various pretences, made equally &s;ub&s;ervient. To tho&s;e of a lighter or more licentious turn of think|ing, who are inclined to look rather with compa&s;|&s;ion than cen&s;ure on her who&s;e follies are now laid for ever in the du&s;t, it will afford &s;ome con&s;olation, that all &s;orrow, all &s;uffering, all pain, and all re|mor&s;e, are here clo&s;ed in the peaceful grave; but a reflecting mind, endued with real &s;en&s;ibility, will not forbear to &s;igh on recollecting that a youth of hopeful promi&s;e, a temper &s;uited to hilarity, and a health calculated to &s;weeten toil and render virtuous indu&s;try delightful, were all wa&s;ted with thankle&s;s profu&s;ion in the gradual de&s;truction of every bodily and mental con&s;olation, and life at la&s;t ha&s;tily cut off in mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>How &s;trikingly contra&s;ted is the fate of the&s;e two girls, of whom we are now going to take leave! Both &s;tarted in the race of life with equal preten|&s;ions to hope and &s;ucce&s;s. The one, by a placid and even cour&s;e, has reached a goal, to which pru|dence directed and virtue led her; the other, di&s;|daining the bridle of in&s;truction, flung her&s;elf mad|ly on precipices and quick&s;ands, in which &s;he is at la&s;t fallen and overwhelmed.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="42">The &s;everal incidental circum&s;tances introduced into this picture, though not immediately dependent on the principal &s;ubject, mu&s;t not be wholly pa&s;&s;ed over without notice. On the wall of the church we perceive a fragment of a broken monument, which was formerly placed there in the vain pre&s;umption of perpetuating the memory of its now-forgotten object; its boa&s;t being rendered ineffectual by the ravages of time or accident, which have &s;wept away the name of him whom it was intended to im|mortalize. In the corner of the picture, a chim|ney-&s;weeper, carele&s;&s;ly in&s;ulting over the dead with a triumph which he knows mu&s;t now be &s;uf|fered with impunity, is &s;eated on the tomb of a &s;tately warrior, who&s;e rank once in&s;pired awe, and who&s;e looks &s;truck terror into the hearts of all be|holders. What greater humiliation of mortal vani|ty, or what greater proof can be exhibited that every man's be&s;t monument is found in his vir|tues, and that di&s;tinctions cea&s;e to be regarded with reverence, when they are no longer u&s;eful to the world.

<P>It may perhaps &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome a|pology for repre&s;enting an union between per&s;ons of unequal rank as the &s;pecimen of a reward, which
<PB N="47" REF="43">&s;hould excite others to imitation. In the view of a general rule, it cannot be doubted that, from the many favourable co-incidences of manners, con|nections, and opinions, which ari&s;e from a &s;imila|rity of education in &s;imilar &s;tations, the mo&s;t fre|quent chances of happine&s;s will be found in a part|ner of equal rank; but it will &s;urely be allowed that virtue and merit may be found equally in the lower as in the higher cla&s;&s;es of life, and that the&s;e endow|ments will generally meet with their reward. In an in&s;tance like the pre&s;ent, a virtuous young woman, who&s;e amiable di&s;po&s;ition and qualities have been demon&s;trated in every part of her conduct, is &s;uffi|ciently proved to be a valuable acqui&s;ition to any rank; and it will &s;carcely be denied that no fortui|tous difference of manners or deportment can &s;o far &s;uper&s;ede her real virtues as to become a bar to the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of dome&s;tic connubial happine&s;s. A &s;hort review of the &s;cenes, in which &s;he has been &s;hewn, will &s;erve to evince this truth: &mdash; in the fir&s;t &s;tage of this work, &s;he is repre&s;ented as careful and indu&s;trious; in the &s;econd, &s;he meekly, humbly, and with a due &s;en&s;e of its value, receives whole|&s;ome in&s;truction and admonition; in the fourth, &s;he &s;hews innocence and piety; in the fifth, a tender and compa&s;&s;ionate heart; in the &s;ixth, inflexible cha&s;|tity; in the eighth, gratitude, mode&s;ty, and humili|ty; and, in the ninth, &s;he appears benevolent, charitable, and forgiving.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="44">Surely the que&s;tion may with &s;afety be a&s;ked, whether &s;uch a character does not de&s;erve a reward, at lea&s;t equal to that with which &s;he is crowned in this our GRAPHIC and (we tru&s;t we &s;hall again be allowed &s;o to call it) our MORAL DRAMA.</P>
