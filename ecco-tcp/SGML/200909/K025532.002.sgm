<HEAD>LETTER LI. Lady Loui&s;a G. to Lady Jane S.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE kept faith with my father, and given Sir George Revel another hearing. He has ju&s;t left me.</P>
<P>I believe the &s;illy man thought to dazzle me by the finery of his per&s;on, for he was mo&s;t &s;umptuou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed; that timidity and em|bara&s;&s;ment, which a real lover would have felt in his predicament, he did not even affect, for he approached me with a gay complacent air, and in a kind of raillying tone opened the con|ver&s;ation, as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">I hope, Lady Loui&s;a, I have now the honor to approach you in a more favorable moment, than when we la&s;t met at the Opera; I flatter my&s;elf I am indebted to your voluntary good will for this happine&s;s, and that I am not too pre&s;umptuous in &s;uppo&s;ing your &s;entiments have changed in my favor.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own to you I felt my heart ri&s;e again&s;t him for the manner even more than the mat|ter of this &s;peech, and I had &s;o &s;trong a pro|pen&s;ity to humble his &s;elf-a&s;&s;urance, as well as to &s;horten a di&s;agreeable conver&s;ation, that I immediately replied to him in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>Sir George Revel, if you want that generous indignation which naturally revolts from every favor that is extorted from the be&s;tower, I am &s;orry to di&s;cover that the only valuable attri|bute, which belongs to pride, is that which you do not po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>I perceive, Madam, by this &s;ample of your &s;everity, that whatever pride I may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion for it all; &s;ome pride I mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have had, or I could never have a&s;pired to addre&s;s the fine&s;t woman in the world, with a &s;pirit the mo&s;t implacable.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then you was to wa&s;te no more
<PB N="3" REF="4">
time upon that implacable &s;pirit; for though you may not be inclined to con&s;ult my repo&s;e, yet it is to be pre&s;umed you have &s;ome con&s;i|deration for your own.</P>
<P>All the con&s;ideration in life for both, my adorable Lady Loui&s;a: for your's in the fir&s;t place, to who&s;e enjoyments I am prepared to dedicate every thing that fortune can purcha&s;e or plea&s;ure be&s;tow; to my own in the &s;econd degree, becau&s;e you are all that I de&s;ire on earth, and without you I mu&s;t be mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>You are ma&s;ter of my time, Sir George; I mu&s;t hear whatever you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, you took a very early oppor|tunity of telling me this interview was extorted from you; you did not &s;uffer me to indulge the hope that you had been a&s;&s;enting to it: you let me know betimes that I am not the object of your pre&s;ent inclinations, and your eyes directed me to find out my rival; but &s;o mean a rival is not worth my notice; whil&s;t I am looking up to Lady Loui&s;a I cannot pay attention to the worm that is crawling in the du&s;t; I mu&s;t believe that my devotion and a&s;&s;iduities will in the end prevail, and as no in|ferior beauty can &s;atisfy my ambition, whil&s;t I
<PB N="4" REF="5">
have fortune and preten&s;ions to a&s;pire to your Lady&s;hip, I &s;hall per&s;evere in &s;pite of all re|pul&s;es to adore you.</P>
<P>You have again taken upon you, without any licence, to point out an imaginary rival, which, as a creature merely of your own brain, you have my free leave to de&s;cribe as you plea&s;e; but believe me, Sir George Revel, it is very po&s;&s;ible for me to decline the honor of your addre&s;&s;es, and yet be without the plea of any other attachment.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, I am under no difficulty to account for your prejudices again&s;t me; I know how apt we are to contract the habits and opi|nions of tho&s;e we live with; I cannot forget that your Lady&s;hip has a mother, who di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed me from her doors; I can recollect whom &s;he employed in that honorable office, and I mu&s;t not wonder if the mother's favorite is the daughter's pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Your in&s;inuations, I now replied, &s;avour &s;o &s;trongly of a purpo&s;ed in&s;ult, that they would warrant me in an immediate di&s;avowal of any further intercour&s;e or conver&s;ation with you; but the character of my mother is not to be glanced at even in the &s;lighte&s;t manner, with|out
<PB N="5" REF="6">
a full inve&s;tigation of the fal&s;ehoods upon which you ground tho&s;e in&s;inuations.</P>
<P>Fal&s;ehoods do you call them! is it not noto|rious to all the world&mdash;?</P>
<P>What, I demanded, what is notorious to all the world?</P>
<P>The partiality of Lady G. to her creature Arundel.</P>
<P>I now ro&s;e from my &s;eat, and, whil&s;t my heart &s;welled with indignation&mdash;I will not con&s;ent, &s;aid I, to hold any further di&s;cour&s;e with the defamer of my mother; and as it is for her &s;ake only that I have endured this interview, &s;o I now prote&s;t that until you have atoned to her, until I &s;ee her in this very hou&s;e, re&s;tored to her family, and hear from her own lips that &s;he is heartily and &s;incerely reconciled to you, and joins her authority with my father's for compelling me to another conference, (which I think will not ha&s;tily happen) no force nor per&s;ua&s;ion, not a thou&s;and deaths, if it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;uffer them, &s;hall prevail with me to commit my&s;elf to your company any more.</P>
<P>With the&s;e words I abruptly left him to his meditations, and retiring to my chamber, gave
<PB N="6" REF="7">
a vent to my full heart; and, having in part di&s;charged the burthen by the relief of tears, I re&s;ort to this con&s;olatory ta&s;k, and pour forth the &s;orrows of my &s;oul into the ear of a friend.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LII. Arundel to Charles Mortlake.</HEAD>
<P>I AM &s;etting out for Arundel-hou&s;e, from which I &s;hall write to you, and give you an account of the works going on at the Par|&s;onage.</P>
<P>As I know you have full occupation for the pre&s;ent at Cambridge, and mu&s;t have &s;ome time to prepare your&s;elf and take leave of your friends, I wi&s;h you not to think of coming into Kent, till you hear from me that things are in &s;ome &s;tate of readine&s;s for your reception.</P>
<P>Alas, my dear Charles, I blu&s;h when I re|collect the vain and idle hope, which like a
<PB N="7" REF="8">
cloud has &s;hrunk from my embrace: the po&s;t|&s;cript of my la&s;t letter, if you have it to refer to, will explain to you what I mean. That vi&s;ion did not appear at Lady Treville's; there was no angel form for my &s;ight, no angel voice for my ear; the phantom, which in my dream I &s;aw, which with my hands I handled, and which in my imagination I care&s;&s;ed, whil&s;t tears of love and tenderne&s;s fell from her melt|ing eyes, is vani&s;hed into air.</P>
<P>Nor is this all;&mdash;&s;uch things might pa&s;s away, and yet hope might be left behind; in|&s;tead of which, de&s;pair &s;upplies her place; for I hear with horror that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of my peace hath been permitted to renew his vi&s;its.</P>
<P>The daemons of Ambition, Avarice and Re|venge have &s;eized the father's heart, and he is driving an ingenuous mind upon the precipice of ruin; a noble nature will be &s;acrificed by the &s;entence of an arbitrary parent.</P>
<P>My heart bleeds with &s;orrow.&mdash;Why &s;hould I di&s;gui&s;e the truth?&mdash;It burns with indig|nation.</P>
<P>Shall I repent of the cha&s;ti&s;ement, which I gave Lord G.? I di&s;dain &s;uch meanne&s;s. I will rather glory in the &s;hare I had, when the
<PB N="8" REF="9">
temple of this Dagon was tumbled to the ground, though my hopes are cru&s;hed beneath its ruins in the fall.</P>
<P>I will re&s;ort to the country, and there I will &s;trive to &s;olace an aching heart by the placid occupation of embelli&s;hing a beautiful &s;pot, in which it hath been my happy chance to plant a virtuous and beloved friend.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIII. Lady Jane S. to Lady Loui&s;a G.</HEAD>
<P>THOU art made for love, my &s;weet Loui&s;a, and love is made for thee, and &s;till you make bad work between you. What are you puzzling about? Do not you &s;ee that Arun|del doats upon you? Do not you know that you doat upon him? What do you want to know more? Shall fathers and mothers, and aunts and cou&s;ins, &s;it in council upon my af|fections? Will they bear the mi&s;ery of my di&s;appointment? Shall they direct the motions of my heart? You have compromi&s;ed with
<PB N="9" REF="10">
your father, &s;o would not I: you have pro|mi&s;ed not to communicate with the man you love, &s;o would not I: you have con&s;ented to receive the &s;tale addre&s;&s;es of the man you ab|hor; I would not do it, if it was to &s;ave the whole &s;pecies.</P>
<P>How much to be preferred is my pride and my poverty, before your wealth and your hu|mility!</P>
<P>Thank Heaven, Scotland is &s;till the land of matrimonial liberty. I love my brother&mdash;my God, how I love him! He is my la&s;t &s;upport in life, my be&s;t, my only friend; but was he to attempt to check the tide of my affections, he might as well turn the current of the winds, &s;tem the flow of the ocean, or beat back the emanation of the &s;un, and whelm the world in darkne&s;s by the breath of his mouth.</P>
<P>That Sir George Revel is my aver&s;ion; I never &s;aw him, but no matter; 'tis enough for me that he had the cowardly principle to draw his &s;word upon an unarmed man: had he the wealth of the world, and all the outward graces that ever centered in the human form, I would <HI>whi&s;tle him down the wind.</HI> Though I am a beggar, recollect I am a beggar en|nobled
<PB N="10" REF="11">
by the blood of Scotti&s;h kings: I'll marry honor in rags, but I'll have no com|merce with a mi&s;creant, though in a robe of &s;tate.</P>
<P>I much doubt, my dear Loui&s;a, if at this moment I have a fair Scotti&s;h pound, which I can truly call my own, and independantly command to be&s;tow where I will; the clothes that cover and the meal that feeds me, are my brother's; but as I &s;hare his pur&s;e, I &s;hare his blood; I will do no wrong to either, nor &s;hall any one do wrong to me. I can defend my own honor, I am competent al&s;o to make my own choice: my hero will &s;upport me with his life, but he will never think of overruling me by his will.</P>
<P>Arundel is a noble fellow; the man, who feared not to provoke the father whil&s;t he ad|mired the daughter, is a man to my heart's content, and I know no authority, which na|ture has given to a parent, that can oblige me to adopt his re&s;entments, when they &s;pring from meanne&s;s, or prevent me from admiring that principle, which is founded in honor.</P>
<P>Your Arundel is the nephew of my Arun|del, of that glorious creature, who perhaps at
<PB N="11" REF="12">
this moment is bleeding in his country's &s;er|vice, and, with my gallant hero by his &s;ide, vollying the Briti&s;h thunder on our enemies, and has he not an hereditary claim upon my heart? Ah! my dear Loui&s;a, had you my &s;pirit of rebellion added to your propen&s;ity to the tender pa&s;&s;ion, all this combu&s;tion would have been avoided, and one re&s;olute &s;tep &s;trait forwards would have &s;aved thou&s;ands, which you have now to take through crooked paths and round-about roads before you &s;hall arrive weary and jaded at the end of your journey.</P>
<P>If Love a&s;&s;ails me, which he has not yet thought fit to do to any &s;erious porpo&s;e, I will make a &s;hort battle of it; he &s;hall not wa&s;te my &s;trength with manoeuvres, for I will put the affair to i&s;&s;ue at once. 'Tis to this re&s;o|lution I am now indebted for having brought a love-&s;uit to its conclu&s;ion, which might el&s;e have been as tedious as a &s;uit in Chancery; for my gentleman was one of tho&s;e pruden|tial, worldly-minded dealers, who wait for bet|ter times, and look &s;o clo&s;ely to what is called the main chance, as to let all other chances go by them without thinking them worth atten|tion. I am &s;peaking of Sir Adam Crichton,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
whom you remember dancing after me all la&s;t winter in London, and a pretty dance I led him. Fortune threw him in my way again at Edinborough: and being a per&s;on, whom few women could look upon with indifference, I confe&s;s I was not di&s;plea&s;ed to find him renew his addre&s;&s;es with more ardor than at the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Many days had not pa&s;&s;ed in this manner, when Sir Adam took his opportunity of mak|ing certain honorable propo&s;als to me, declar|ing, in all <HI>due phra&s;e and empha&s;is</HI> proper to a lover, that his fate depended on my an&s;wer, he could not &s;urvive a refu&s;al; the happine&s;s of his life, nay, his very life it&s;elf, was in this moment to be decided, he trembled for the i&s;&s;ue, yet he flattered him&s;elf I was too noble to have encouraged him to hope, only to plunge him in di&s;appointment and de&s;pair. Whil&s;t this rhap&s;ody was going on he kept his eyes fixt upon me, and as I was certainly not di&s;|plea&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o hand&s;ome a lover at my feet, he no &s;ooner perceived the impre&s;&s;ion he had made on a &s;oft &s;illy heart, which never learnt to play the hypocrite, than catching me in his arms, as if already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his prize,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
he rapturou&s;ly exclaimed&mdash;My life, my &s;oul! Oh let me hope that &s;mile con&s;ents! Oh &s;uf|fer your tran&s;ported lover thus to welcome the au&s;picious omen, thus to &s;eal our happy union with a fond embrace!&mdash;</P>
<P>A thought now &s;truck me (naturally enough, you will &s;ay, as my lover was a Scotti&s;h man) that in the mid&s;t of the&s;e raptures he might po&s;&s;ibly be in a mi&s;take as to his own di&s;inte|re&s;tedne&s;s; for, as a vulgar error had gone out in our country, that I was to inherit my aunt Selkirk's fortune, it was not impo&s;&s;ible but this worthy gentleman might have fallen into the trap, which one or two of his predece&s;&s;ors had &s;tumbled over in time pa&s;t, and therefore I thought it be&s;t to make a clear field before we proceeded to further action, by removing all &s;uch &s;tumbling-blocks out of his way.</P>
<P>A few words &s;ufficed to a&s;&s;ure him that I was to all intents and purpo&s;es a compleat beggar, and until Jupiter &s;ent another golden &s;hower from the &s;kies, likely &s;o to remain to the end of my days. As Sir Adam was a wi&s;e and prudent man in the main, though his ideas had been a little &s;ubtilized ju&s;t now by the heat of his imagination, I believe he would have been
<PB N="14" REF="15">
heartily glad to have di&s;pen&s;ed with all the rap|tures of his late embrace, had he even cla&s;ped the godde&s;s Venus in his arms; and though it was life or death with him but a minute before, whil&s;t my aunt Selkirk was behind the cur|tain, yet now it was pretty clear there were &s;ome things dearer to him than life it&s;elf; and if I had not &s;miled quite &s;o tenderly upon him, he would have &s;truggled hard to &s;urvive the di&s;appointment of his hopes: in &s;hort, at that moment I much doubt if he would not rather have taken my aunt Selkirk her&s;elf in his arms, for the next embrace, than poor needy Lady Jane.</P>
<P>Figure to your&s;elf &s;ome greedy contractor, in the very moment of driving his bargain with the mini&s;ter for the plunder of the pub|lic, pre&s;ented by that mini&s;ter with an order for refunding the peculations he had ama&s;&s;ed, and you may form &s;ome idea of Sir Adam's countenance at this in&s;tant.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t take &s;ome credit to my&s;elf for re&s;i&s;t|ing a certain malicious impul&s;e, which tempt|ed me to indulge a little raillery at his ex|pence; but charity prevailed over contempt, and, as I &s;aw enough to convince me I was
<PB N="15" REF="16">
in company with a very &s;ordid fellow, me|thought the &s;ooner I was rid of &s;uch &s;ociety the better.</P>
<P>I &s;u&s;pect, my good Sir Adam, &s;aid I, we are both in a mi&s;take ju&s;t now; you in &s;uppo&s;ing me not &s;o poor as I really am, I in believing you more di&s;intere&s;ted than in fact you are: let us therefore content our&s;elves with the di&s;|covery we have mutually made of each other's di&s;po&s;ition: I am &s;atisfied you could have lik|ed me, if it had been your intere&s;t &s;o to do; you are &s;atisfied I could have liked you, if you had not preferred your intere&s;t. Thus then the account &s;tands between us&mdash;You have offered marriage, and taken an embrace by way of earne&s;t and in pledge of faith: take your offer back again, I relea&s;e you from it; and as for the embrace, much good may it do you, let it pa&s;s! my aunt Selkirk is in the fault of that; therefore you may return it to her the fir&s;t time you meet, or to any other rich old dowager like her, who&s;e money-bags may tempt you to be&s;tow it on their owner.&mdash;Exit Sir Adam: he is off, good man! <HI>My life! my &s;oul! my idol!</HI>&mdash;all tho&s;e charming words are vani&s;hed into air, and your poor

<HEAD>LETTER LIV. Lady Loui&s;a G. to the Counte&s;s of G.</HEAD>
<P>ALAS, my deare&s;t mother, to what extre|mities have I been driven &s;ince our la&s;t unhappy parting!</P>
<P>My father, though dive&s;ted of his office, and no longer courting parliamentary &s;upport, is not dive&s;ted of his partiality for Sir George Revel: he re&s;ents my behavior to him in a very high degree, and hath again broke out
<PB N="18" REF="19">
into the bittere&s;t invectives again&s;t you and Mr. Arundel, for being in a combination again&s;t him, and even hinted (with indigna|tion I repeat it to you), that you engaged Mr. Arundel in a preconcerted quarrel with Sir George, that by di&s;patching him out of the way you might make an opening for your favorite, as he calls that gentleman, to carry on a de&s;ign, which he pretends to believe you had formed of marrying him to me.</P>
<P>Inveterate again&s;t him for the &s;peech he made in parliament, of which the town yet rings with applau&s;e, he keeps no mea&s;ures in his re&s;entment, but throws out certain in&s;inua|tions, which no one, who had not bidden fare|well to truth and delicacy, could have &s;ugge&s;t|ed, and which with ju&s;t abhorrence I forbear to mention.</P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion, he drove me to the painful al|ternative, either to admit Sir George Revel to renew his addre&s;&s;es, or to be excluded from any farther corre&s;pondence or communication with you. I &s;ubmitted to receive the vi&s;its of that odious man again, for this is temporizing only;&mdash;but if I would con&s;ent to his propo&s;als, and clo&s;e with the full wi&s;hes of my deluded
<PB N="19" REF="20">
father, then I might effect a reconciliation in my family, then I might re&s;tore a bani&s;hed mother to her home, his arms &s;hould be open to receive you, and all be peace and harmony again.</P>
<P>The &s;elf-fame day pre&s;ented me with the &s;ight of my unwelcome vi&s;itor Sir George: abject as he is to &s;ue to me, who had before di&s;carded him, &s;till he could not &s;o keep down his proud &s;pirit as tamely to endure the &s;lights I put upon him. At la&s;t he gave a loo&s;e to his audacious tongue, charging me with hav|ing attached my heart to &s;ome more happy ri|val, and pre&s;uming to &s;ay I had contracted that attachment by copying your Lady&s;hip in your prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for a certain favorite, plainly pointing at Mr. Arundel.</P>
<P>This in&s;olent in&s;inuation &s;tung me to the quick, and, whil&s;t my blood boiled with indig|nation, I declared to him no force &s;hould pre|vail over me to admit the man into my pre|&s;ence, who dared to revile the character of my mother. It was on your account, I plainly told him, that I then &s;uffered his vi&s;it, and until he had completely atoned to you for his calumnious in&s;inuation, till I &s;aw you again
<PB N="20" REF="21">
rein&s;tated in your family, and received from your lips an a&s;&s;urance of reconciliation, I would never &s;ee him more, whatever I might undergo from the di&s;plea&s;ure of my father.</P>
<P>With this denunciation I abruptly left him; and here the matter re&s;ts at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>And now, my beloved, my indulgent mo|ther, what remains but that I open all my heart to you? Amid&s;t all the fal&s;ehoods this calumniator uttered, &s;till I mu&s;t acknowledge he is fatally too right in one conjecture.&mdash;Ah! Madam, it is my hard fate to love and to de&s;pair: a &s;ecret pa&s;&s;ion preys upon my heart, my health &s;inks under it. Would you know the real &s;ource of all tho&s;e &s;trange vici&s;|&s;itudes, tho&s;e incoherencies, by which my &s;pirits have been agitated for &s;ome time pa&s;t, date your account of them from the very hour in which I fir&s;t encountered the all-conquer|ing eyes of Arundel.</P>

<P>SOME bu&s;ine&s;s having occurred, which may probably detain me a day or two from town, I beg leave to report to your Lord&s;hip the event of my expedition into Kent.</P>
<P>On my arrival at the hou&s;e which Lady G. had inhabited, I was informed by a &s;ervant, that &s;he had ju&s;t left it to return no more: I de&s;ired to know to what place &s;he had remov|ed; he could not tell where his Lady was gone, he had been paid his wages and was di&s;charged. Perceiving he was a clowni&s;h country fellow, I offered him money if he would inform me of the truth; he per&s;i&s;ted in the &s;ame an&s;wer: I a&s;ked him who accompa|nied his Lady on her journey; a maid-&s;ervant was in the po&s;t-chai&s;e with her, and one man attended on hor&s;eback; nobody el&s;e was of the party. Did he know any body who could inform me where &s;he was gone, as I had bu&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="32" REF="33">
of importance; he knew nobody who could give me that information; he was &s;ure none of his fellow-&s;ervants had been in the &s;e|cret, el&s;e he &s;hould have known it from them: upon recollection, he &s;aid perhaps the gentle|man, for whom he had a letter, might be able to tell: upon a&s;king the name of the gentle|man for whom he had the letter, he &s;aid it was Arundel, and that he had the letter then in his charge, which he was ordered to carry to Arun|del-hou&s;e and deliver with his own hands.</P>
<P>A thought then &s;truck me to a&s;k him if he knew the per&s;on of Mr. Arundel, and the fel|low &s;aying he did not, I thought it an allowa|ble fraud in &s;uch a ca&s;e to tell him, that was very true, el&s;e he would have known he was now &s;peaking to that very per&s;on, for I was Mr. Arundel and had come purpo&s;ely to en|quire for the letter, which I was in expectation of; upon which I &s;lipped a few pieces into his hand and got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the letter.</P>
<P>As there &s;eems &s;ome my&s;tery in this corre|&s;pondence with your Lady and Mr. Arundel, knowing the terms your Lord&s;hip is upon with that ingrateful gentleman, I hope I &s;hall not incur your di&s;plea&s;ure by the means I took for

<P>It does not become me to be officious in matters of family concern, and I hope your Lord&s;hip will believe I am the la&s;t per&s;on to offend your delicacy in that re&s;pect; but I cannot avoid a remark upon the time, which Mr. Arundel cho&s;e for going into the country, neither is it to be overlooked that her Lady|&s;hip cho&s;e a re&s;idence within a few miles of this gentleman's hou&s;e: Is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that he is not in the &s;ecret of this &s;udden mea|&s;ure, which had it been the mea&s;ure of any other per&s;on than of Lady G.

natural &s;implicity, as will not &s;uffer me to doubt of his veracity.</P>

<P>IT is clear to me, me dear Sir George, that this letter you intercepted is only one of a number, that have pa&s;&s;ed between Arundel and my wife to the &s;ame wicked and in&s;idious pur|po&s;es: the prejudices their cabal has pro|duced in my daughter's mind are too &s;tubborn to give way to gentle efforts; the&s;e have been tried to no purpo&s;e, and it is now time to take more lively mea&s;ures for bringing her to a &s;en&s;e of her own happine&s;s as well as of her duty to me.</P>
<P>I &s;ay to you in confidence, that my &s;u&s;pi|cions of Arundel go to all po&s;&s;ible lengths: I believe he has been a traitor to me and the &s;e|ducer of my wife's honor: What el&s;e could be the purport of that &s;ecret corre&s;pondence, which was carried on to the very moment of Lady G.'s flight out of England? What could provoke her to that flight, except to pur&s;ue her &s;candalous commerce with more &s;ecurity

<P>The cur&s;e of it is, that this letter, which you have &s;topt, di&s;clo&s;es nothing of their con|nection, which can criminate him with my wife. I in&s;ert a copy of it for your peru&s;al.</P>

<P>This is the letter; a delicate method her Lady&s;hip takes of teaching him to cajole her hu&s;band: how you &s;tand with her is pretty clear, and duely con&s;iderate &s;he &s;eems to be of the &s;afety of her favorite.

<P>BY a confe&s;&s;ion with difficulty obtained from Lady G.'s &s;ervant it appears, that an a&s;&s;ignation was made, and a meeting had in con&s;equence within a certain grove at the bot|tom of her garden, where there is a &s;mall plea|&s;ure-hou&s;e, conveniently equipt for the pur|po&s;e. The per&s;on of Mr. Arundel, though he had attempted to di&s;gui&s;e it, was known to her lady&s;hip's London &s;ervant, and from her my informer was certified as to his identity; that he did actually come to the place appointed, was admitted to your Lady in the plea&s;ure-hou&s;e, and was there alone with her for the &s;pace of an hour, to the&s;e facts he was him&s;elf a witne&s;s.

<P>I am aware this charge cannot be imparted to her without its coming to the knowledge of Mr. Arundel; her Lady&s;hip will probably put that out of que&s;tion; but let the guilty tremble; I fear not his re&s;entment; my part in the bu&s;ine&s;s I am ready to avow; as the inve&s;tigator of truth, I am fearle&s;s as to con&s;equences; in the character of your Lord|&s;hip's friend, and in hope of being honored with a &s;till nearer name, I am not only pre|pared, but forward to face the wor&s;t of dan|gers, that can re&s;ult from the rage and de&s;pe|ration of a detected villain.

<P>HOW &s;hall I expre&s;s my thanks to you for developing this dark and infamous affair? At length the horrid truth comes out; and the world, which with its u&s;ual misjudging malignity has hitherto &s;tampt my behavior to Lady G. with the fal&s;e character of cruelty, will now of force acknowledge the ju&s;tice of my re&s;entment, and at the &s;ame time admire the mildne&s;s of it, if once the infamy of that woman becomes public: but whether I &s;hould carry the matter to that length or not, is with me a very &s;erious que&s;tion. I have had too much experience of the world's way of judging in the&s;e affairs, not to be aware that the hu&s;band always makes a very contemp|tible figure on the occa&s;ion. People are very willing to find excu&s;es in his conduct for the offending party, and with this view take great pains to &s;crape together all the dirty &s;tories

they can collect on the &s;core of retaliation: in the mean time the broad &s;hame &s;tares him in the face and every body <HI>hoots the cuckold as he pa&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Now this is a degree of ignominy, which I cannot &s;tand, neither is it to be pre&s;umed that I can have &s;o &s;trictly &s;quared my actions by the rule of moral purity, as to &s;ay that no breach of nuptial fidelity has occurred on my part; this falls to the lot of few men to boa&s;t of, and &s;ome things, I am &s;en&s;ible, have pa&s;&s;ed with me of too public a nature to be controverted. Lady G. to do her ju&s;tice, has been a very di&s;creet and prudent woman, this affair only excepted; &s;he has been altogether &s;o quiet and unofficious in her high &s;tation, that &s;he has made no enemies, and many friends: on the contrary, I have been long held up to the public in an unpopular point of view, and am now recently &s;tript of that power and place which would el&s;e be &s;ome protection to me; &s;tript by the very hands of that political phaenomenon, who is the author of my &s;hame, and the object of the world's unbounded flattery, who at this very moment is con&s;picuou&s;ly the favorite of fame and for|tune.

<P>The&s;e are among&s;t the con&s;equences which I fore&s;ee would en&s;ue, if we were to make the affair public; and therefore as the &s;ecret is known only to you, with you I would wi&s;h it to re&s;t for the pre&s;ent at lea&s;t, and until I am compelled to draw it forth in my own de|fence.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXX. Arundel to Charles Mortlake.</HEAD>
<P>I AM delighted to hear of your holiday at Arundel. Ye&s;terday in the forenoon, as I was walking to the Admiralty upon enquiry after my uncle, ju&s;t as I was entering the court, a large old tumbril of a coach with &s;ix hor&s;es and three po&s;tilions was driving to the gate; two &s;ailors were &s;eated on the box, in
<PB N="62" REF="63">
&s;carlet jackets, and upon the roof two more in flowered cotton wai&s;tcoats with long &s;ilk handkerchiefs round their necks, loo&s;e and fluttering in the wind. I made one of a mul|titude, which &s;oon collected round the gate, and immediately heard a cry of <HI>Captain Arun|del for ever!</HI> echoed by three cheers from the fellows aloft.</P>
<P>My heart bounded with joy and I darted through the throng to the coach-door, which no &s;ooner opened, than out bolted my uncle John, and in an in&s;tant I &s;prung into the hero's arms. With rapture I beheld him &s;afe, &s;ound, and in health; he was accompanied by the young Earl of S. (the Captain of his brave frigate), an old &s;eaman with a wrapper round his head, and two noble boys in mid|&s;hipmen's uniform. As &s;oon as we got into the hall, which was a work of &s;ome time, my uncle pre&s;ented me to Lord S. crying out to me, Here, Frank, I pre&s;ent you to a noble officer, who is an honor to the navy of Bri|tain;&mdash;then turning to Lord S. he added, My Lord, I beg you will love this boy for my &s;ake. We embraced, and if Lord S. felt the &s;ame emotions as I did, our friend&s;hip is
<PB N="63" REF="64">
e&s;tabli&s;hed for life. My uncle then demanded if Sir Francis was alive and well? Alive, I told him he was, but little more: he &s;hook his head, and cried, The wor&s;e luck, repeat|ing it more than once.&mdash;I told him in few words my &s;ituation with Sir Francis, &s;inking however the cata&s;trophe of my cou&s;in.&mdash;This &s;eemed to plea&s;e him much, and he &s;aid, If you are upon &s;uch terms, all's well! Go home and leave us to do our bu&s;ine&s;s here; tell my brother I &s;hall come to dinner and bring my friend Lord S. with me: the&s;e young&s;ters mu&s;t &s;cout away to their fathers and mothers, naming two noble families, which it &s;eems they belonged to.</P>
<P>Immediately I left the place, and ha&s;tening back to Gro&s;venor &s;quare, informed my uncle of my happy rencontre. The gallant old Ge|neral, though in a very feeble &s;tate, would be carried into the eating-parlour to receive his vi&s;itors at dinner-time; and thanks be to God! one day of true enjoyment was added to his life; for his &s;en&s;es &s;eemed to brighten with the plea&s;ure, and we pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours together of &s;o &s;uperior a &s;ort, that even &s;ick|ne&s;s and infirmity could not da&s;h his joys.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65">He in&s;i&s;ted with my uncle, that both him|&s;elf and Lord S. &s;hould take up their lodging in his hou&s;e; this was readily accepted by him, and at la&s;t agreed to by his Lord&s;hip al&s;o; and this morning I attended upon them both to the King's levee, where I was witne&s;s to the very gracious reception which my &s;overeign gave to the&s;e de&s;erving officers. My uncle John, who&s;e athletic figure is more formed for the quarter-deck than the court, attracted every body's eyes, and, con&s;idering it was a fir&s;t performance, acquitted him&s;elf to admi|ration. You mu&s;t picture to your&s;elf a rough and martial figure above &s;ix feet high, his head bald to the crown, and a few grey curling locks in his neck, with a deep cut acro&s;s his fore|head, over which he wears a black patch; and to this you mu&s;t affix a face, which defies <HI>the winds of heaven,</HI> let them <HI>vi&s;it</HI> it as <HI>rough|ly</HI> as they may; and &s;uch is my uncle John; a maje&s;tic figure on his proper element, but rather uncouth in a courtly circle. When the royal hand was &s;tretched out for the cu&s;tom|ary ceremonial, the zealous hero fell on his knees, and &s;eizing it with more good-will than grace, &s;aluted it with a &s;mack, not quite
<PB N="65" REF="66">
&s;o loud as the morning gun, yet &s;mart enough to &s;urprize the delicate nerves of the well-bred per&s;onages there a&s;&s;embled.

In the dialogue of the &s;cene, the hero's mo|de&s;ty was no le&s;s con&s;picuous than his ardor had been in the action of it; that counte|nance, which the enemies of his country could not compel to change its hue, now coloured at the gracious prai&s;es of his &s;overeign, and was over&s;pread with blu&s;hes, that would not have di&s;graced the maiden cheek, when fir&s;t pre&s;ented to the &s;alute of maje&s;ty; and my ears tingled whil&s;t I heard him utter the&s;e words, in reply to the many gracious &s;peeches that had been made to him:&mdash;Sir, your Ma|je&s;ty's goodne&s;s over-rates my &s;mall de&s;erts; the humble&s;t of your &s;ubjects has no honor to boa&s;t of, but the honor of commanding a &s;hip's company in perfect di&s;cipline, and bravely officered; and I had been the mo&s;t abject of beings, if the gallant &s;upport I received from the Earl of S. my noble col|league,
<PB N="66" REF="67">
had not in&s;pired me to emulate his valor, and jointly exert my&s;elf in the &s;ervice of the mo&s;t gracious &s;overeign on earth.&mdash;I did not lo&s;e the look with which this was received; it was more than words could have uttered, it would have repaid the triumphs of a Rodney or the di&s;coveries of a Cook.</P>
<P>It was now in turn for the brave Earl of S. to receive tho&s;e prai&s;es, which the father of his people and the patron of merit knows &s;o well to be&s;tow. I never &s;aw a finer per&s;on than this young nobleman, fa&s;hioned as if he had lived all his days in a court, yet with all the manli|ne&s;s that marks the hero, he &s;eems formed for conque&s;ts over both the &s;exes: he is of the noble&s;t blood in Scotland, though the fortune of his hou&s;e, by a variety of events in time pa&s;t, has been &s;o impaired as to leave him a very &s;canty inheritance for the &s;upport of his dig|nity. He has &s;erved under my uncle from the time he went fir&s;t to &s;ea, and &s;eems to bear him all the duty and affection of a &s;on; he was promoted to a &s;loop for his gallantry in boarding an enemy's &s;hip, when he was my uncle's fir&s;t lieutenant, and this cruize was the fir&s;t he had taken in the capacity of po&s;t-cap|tain;
<PB N="67" REF="68">
the rich capture he has now made will re&s;tore the &s;plendor of his family, and furni&s;h him the means of genero&s;ity to an only &s;i&s;ter, to whom he is mo&s;t affectionately devoted: he talks of her in raptures, and &s;eems to rejoice in his good fortune only as he may &s;hare it with her. Lady Jane S. is now on her road out of Scotland and he expects her hourly; Sir Francis tells me &s;he is a mo&s;t lovely girl, the very image of his Lord&s;hip, and, what endears her to me more than all, the friend of my adored Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>In&s;olent!&mdash;to dare to call her <HI>my Loui&s;a</HI>; and yet, believe me, I would not barter the hope that now brightens in my pro&s;pect for all the trea&s;ures of the world.&mdash;Hear me only and then judge.</P>
<P>La&s;t night Lord S. and I went to Lady Treville's: my good uncle John, having per|formed his court ceremonies to his heart's content, was &s;o exhilarated on the occa&s;ion, and made &s;uch frequent libations to his Ma|je&s;ty's health, to the navy of Old England, and a &s;tring of &s;ea-toa&s;ts, which he is humo|rou&s;ly expert in, together with all the manual accompaniments thereunto belonging, that

though he could not drive my Lord and me beyond the verge of &s;obriety, he fairly pu&s;hed us to the utmo&s;t edge of it, &s;o that I went to the good old Lady's animated at lea&s;t, if not elevated; and finding a party a&s;&s;embled ac|cording to cu&s;tom for a little concert, whom &s;hould my eyes encounter, ready &s;eated at the harp&s;ichord, but the Cecilia, the &s;aint of har|mony and my &s;oul's idol, my divine Loui&s;a? A lover's &s;ight hath the rapidity of lightning; my eyes in&s;tantaneou&s;ly caught her charming form, and every other object became invi&s;ible to me.&mdash;Oh Charles, Charles! &s;uch a glowing blu&s;h mounted in her cheeks, &s;uch a gleam of &s;un&s;hine darted from her eyes, and I &s;aw my &s;ilent welcome in a &s;mile of &s;o much &s;weet|ne&s;s, (let me not boa&s;t too much if I pre&s;ume to &s;ay) of &s;o much love, that I was tran&s;ported out of my&s;elf: wild as I was and out of all government of di&s;cretion, I flew to the en|chanting object of my adoration with an enthu|&s;ia&s;m, that obeyed no forms, and &s;hould cer|tainly have dropt upon my knee at her feet, if &s;he had not been more quick to fore&s;ee and prevent my de&s;ign, than I was to execute it&mdash;<HI>Mr. Arundel!</HI> &s;he cried, in that tone of alarm,
<PB N="69" REF="70">
which to the ear of &s;en&s;ibility communicates a volume in a word: it was enough; I recollect|ed my&s;elf in the in&s;tant, and her glove having fallen from her lap, or more probably &s;he having de&s;ignedly dropt it, the attitude I had devoted to other purpo&s;es was very aptly ap|plied to a more ordinary act of common polite|ne&s;s. Enough however had pa&s;&s;ed to throw her into a confu&s;ion, that whil&s;t it made me blu&s;h for what &s;he &s;uffered, perfectly enchanted me with the lovely manner of it.&mdash;Oh Charles, there was a magic in it, that was irrre&s;i&s;tibly charming; &s;he rallied me with &s;uch eyes, &s;he recovered her&s;elf with &s;o much exqui&s;ite ad|dre&s;s, and intuitively di&s;covering all that was pa&s;&s;ing in my mind, and no le&s;s quick in di&s;|cerning the elevation of my &s;pirits, with an archne&s;s in her look and tittering at the &s;ame time, &s;he &s;aid to me half aloud&mdash;You have been dining, Mr. Arundel!&mdash;Then addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Lord S. &s;he added&mdash;I think your Lord&s;hip ki&s;&s;ed hands to-day.&mdash;Yes, Madam, &s;aid he, and I expected to have &s;een Arundel repeat the ceremony to-night.&mdash;To &s;o fair a &s;overeign, I replied, the adoration of the heart is the fitter &s;ervice, and I &s;tand corrected.&mdash;
<PB N="70" REF="71">
Well, well, returned &s;he, if you are a loyal &s;ubject, let me have a proof of your obedience by taking up your in&s;trument at the word of command and gratifying this good company with the &s;ound of it. Upon the word I flew to my po&s;t, the charmer of all ears as well as eyes &s;elected the very &s;ong, &s;he fir&s;t performed at Spring Grove, and whi&s;pering me as &s;he ar|ranged it on her de&s;k, &s;aid, This &s;ong is be|come a great favorite with me; I hope you will not like it the le&s;s for being an old ac|quaintance;&mdash;but harkye, Mr. Arundel, added &s;he, do not leave me in the pa&s;&s;ages, for I am &s;o fluttered I &s;carce know how to attempt it.&mdash;By Heaven! I murmured in her ear, by Heaven you are an angel, you have the beauty of an angel and the forbearance of one, or you would order me out of the room.&mdash;No, no, &s;he an&s;wered, we cannot part from you; you have a plea for your good &s;pirits; I give you joy of your happine&s;s, you cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s more than I wi&s;h you.&mdash;But hu&s;h!&mdash;not another word; &s;o begin.</P>
<P>If I was ever vain enough to approve of my own performance, it was at this moment; I &s;upported her till I found &s;he had the full
<PB N="71" REF="72">
command of her voice, and then I only gave &s;uch occa&s;ional aids as added to its brilliancy: nothing could exceed the &s;tile in which &s;he &s;ung; every body was charmed, every ear was fea&s;ted, every eye &s;eemed to gaze upon her with delight; it was a circle of friends in per|fect good-humour with each other&mdash;of harmo|ny in every &s;en&s;e of the word; not a glance of envy, not a &s;cowl of jealou&s;y to cloud the &s;un|&s;hine of the &s;oul; I never knew a moment of &s;uch heart-felt rapture.</P>
<P>When the &s;ong was over, Lady Loui&s;a beckoned Lord S. to her, and with a &s;mile, in which benevolence and beauty contended for the pre-eminence, told him &s;he had a little ballad written by a Scotti&s;h mu&s;e, a dear friend of his and her's, adapted al&s;o to a Scotti&s;h tune, which &s;he would give him for the &s;ake of the author; and then turning to me bade me take up my violin and make out an extem|porary accompaniment to the old air of Ro&s;|line Ca&s;tle; &s;he then began a little plaintive ballad, which Lady Jane S. had written, be|ginning with the words&mdash;

Which, though &s;he addre&s;&s;ed to Maria, I have a &s;hrewd &s;u&s;picion was a &s;ub&s;titution of her own in place of Loui&s;a.

<P>A &s;udden tremor &s;eized me, fearing I had offended; but, oh my dear Charles, &s;he cheared me with &s;uch a look, how was it that I did not run delirious at the &s;ight of it?

It &s;hall be quite a private party.&mdash;Ten thou&s;and thanks to my good Lady Treville, replied Lady Loui&s;a; I need not &s;ay how happy it would make me, but it is impo&s;&s;ible: I am ab&s;ent from home upon &s;ufferance, and perhaps, added &s;he, turning her intelligent and &s;oft eyes upon me, I have

already too far tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed upon a forbidden plea&s;ure; I mu&s;t be gone this in&s;tant.&mdash;The&s;e words were uttered with a &s;igh, which opened all my fate upon me and da&s;hed my joys at once into &s;adne&s;s.</P>
<P>De&s;perate however again&s;t all appearances, I followed her out of the room, and offered my hand to conduct her down the &s;tairs; &s;he ac|cepted it mo&s;t complacently, nay, &s;he even &s;eemed to have expected it, and in&s;tead of &s;peaking to her &s;ervants, turned with me into the eating parlour, which opened to the hall. Ah Lady Loui&s;a! &s;aid I as we entered, I am &s;hocked to think that I am the interdicted ob|ject, which expels you from &s;ociety; &s;uffer me, I be&s;eech you, this in&s;tant to leave the hou&s;e.&mdash;Not for the world, &s;he replied; but, without wa&s;ting more words upon a &s;ubject, which I mu&s;t not enlarge upon, permit me to a&s;k you if you have &s;een my mother, for I under&s;tand you have been in her neighbourhood.&mdash;I told her I had not.&mdash;Could I tell where &s;he was gone?&mdash;I a&s;&s;ured her I could not; I under|&s;tood it was out of England, but I could form no gue&s;s at the place; and I was &s;orry to per|ceive by her que&s;tion that it was equally a

and I then concluded by telling her I had re|ceived an an&s;wer to this note, in which Lady G. acquie&s;ced in the propriety of tho&s;e motives, and informed me that &s;he was going out of England without telling me where.&mdash;I am glad you have told me this, &s;he replied, be|cau&s;e I think it not impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hall hear the &s;tory differently &s;tated, and I am deter|mined to believe nothing to the contrary of what you have told me; and now, concluded &s;he, I am afraid I mu&s;t take leave of you. Oh, Lady Loui&s;a, I exclaimed, and at the &s;ame time pre&s;&s;ed her unre&s;i&s;ting hand, may I hope I have not offended you?&mdash;Heavens, Mr. Arundel, offended me! where was your ob&s;ervation, if you could &s;u&s;pect it?&mdash;I know you are all goodne&s;s, conde&s;cen&s;ion, gentle|ne&s;s; but the &s;udden joy of &s;eeing you was too much for me; you conquer every &s;en&s;e at once; you are mi&s;tre&s;s over every heart.&mdash;And yet there is but one, Mr. Arundel, on which I wi&s;h to leave a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;The look &s;he gave me pointed the application, I had been in&s;en&s;ible could I have mi&s;&s;ed it; again I pre&s;&s;ed my lips upon her hand, and with faultering voice replied&mdash;Am I too pre|&s;umptuous,

<P>So &s;aying, &s;he turned ha&s;tily away, and &s;ee|ing me about to follow her to the door, &s;he bade me &s;tay where I was till &s;he was gone, and taking hold of Mrs. Courtenhall's arm ha&s;tened out of the room, be&s;towing on me a look at parting, that &s;aid Farewell in a lan|guage, that no eyes can &s;peak &s;o eloquently as hers.</P>
<P>I rejoined the company up &s;tairs, who were too delicate to make the lea&s;t remark upon my ab&s;ence, and after a little more mu&s;ic our party di&s;per&s;ed, leaving nobody but Lord S. and my&s;elf with Lady Treville, who was ju&s;t telling his Lord&s;hip, that &s;he hoped his &s;i&s;ter would accept of an apartment in her hou&s;e upon her arrival in town, and that &s;he had written a letter for that purpo&s;e to be given to her at Hatfield, where &s;he would change hor&s;es; when our attention being called off by

<P>As Sir Francis had a well-regulated family of &s;ervants, and lived in a &s;tile very &s;uitable to his fortune, our friend has very little trouble with his dome&s;tic arrangements; the works he is carrying on at the Par&s;onage Hou&s;e &s;eem to be his principal occupation at pre&s;ent, and for the pre&s;ent he turns a deaf ear to all projects for the embelli&s;hment of his own domain.&mdash;It is the fir&s;t object with me, (he &s;aid this morning, as we were walking in the park) to make Mortlake happy in his &s;ituation; as for this old man&s;ion and its premi&s;&s;es, I will do no|thing more than keep it in its pre&s;ent good repair, till the time may come that I may con|&s;ult a better ta&s;te than my own for the im|provement of it. Then pau&s;ing for a few mo|ments, with a &s;igh he exclaimed&mdash;But what are the&s;e pre&s;umptuous hopes, which I in|dulge? Ah, Lady Jane, I delude my&s;elf; I do but <HI>walk in a vain &s;hadow:</HI> all the favors of fortune are but lo&s;t upon me; I cannot enjoy them; Was ever man &s;o courted by pro&s;pe|rity?

and my brother, who were walking together arm in arm towards the river&mdash;How am I honored in calling one uncle, and the other friend? Carry your eye up to that hou&s;e, which hangs over the river they are going to: Is it not a charming &s;pot? and how ought I to be ble&s;t in the friend which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it! What a delightful &s;en&s;ation do I feel when I contemplate that habitation, and &s;ay within my&s;elf, in that a&s;ylum I have placed the friend of my heart, the gentle&s;t, kinde&s;t, be&s;t of hu|man beings! Oh, Lady Jane, if ever there was a faultle&s;s creature, Mortlake is the man.&mdash;This methinks is ble&s;&s;ing enough for any one per&s;on's &s;hare in life; but, as if fortune woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> never be weary of her favors to me, &s;he has added to her other gifts the happine&s;s and ho|nor, which I am this moment enjoying with a friend as amiable as &s;he is noble, in who&s;e heart I do not de&s;pair at humble di&s;tance to participate with my Loui&s;a her&s;elf&mdash;I give you his own flattering words, my dear, though I ought to blu&s;h for my a&s;&s;urance.

<P>He and the old Captain were at that in&s;tant very bu&s;ily employed upon the launch of a new boat, ju&s;t arrived from London: the&s;e heroes, who had &s;o lately triumphed over the flag of Spain, were &s;tript to their &s;hirts and oc|cupied in the humble office of tallowing the bottom of a wherry; and &s;o ardent were they both in their ta&s;k, that I doubt if the very odour of their work was not grateful to their no&s;trils: a country fellow was &s;tanding by them, gaping with &s;urprize, but totally out of employment. As the weather is &s;upremely fine, we propo&s;e to go upon the Medway this evening, and under &s;uch command, I &s;hould not tremble to encounter Scylla and Charybdis in all their poetical terrors.</P>
<P>Mortlake was &s;tanding on the oppo&s;ite bank, upon a terrace in his garden which butts again&s;t the river: at the end of this ter|race
<PB N="88" REF="89">
there is a landing-place, where a little boat, which &s;erves to ferry him over the wa|ter, was moored to the &s;hore; and as we ap|proached, we heard the old Captain roaring out to the Doctor, as he calls him, to pu&s;h his boat acro&s;s the &s;tream, and take the lady on board, for that I was coming to vi&s;it him. Upon this &s;ummons he came over; where|upon Arundel and I &s;tept into the boat, and though our worthy ferryman &s;eemed to me to acquit him&s;elf very expertly, yet this old &s;on of the ocean kept jibing and jeering at him, in his &s;ea language, every inch of the way, &s;tanding all the while in his &s;hirt, with the &s;leeves tuck'd up to his elbows, no hat upon his head, and his bald pate &s;hining in the &s;un, a tremendous ga&s;h acro&s;s his forehead plai&s;|tered over with a huge black patch, and of &s;o gigantic a form, that it is no wonder he is terrible to his enemies, when I declare even I, who doat upon him, could not &s;urvey his figure without trembling. Mr. Mort|lake, who delights in his humour, kept up the water language with a great deal of plea&s;antry, till he landed us at the foot of the &s;tairs which lead to his terrace: here, in &s;tepping out of
<PB N="89" REF="90">
the boat, which was rather un&s;teady, my foot &s;lipt, and I &s;hould certainly have had a very ugly fall upon the edge of the boat backwards, if Mortlake had not with great addre&s;s caught me in his arms. My dear brother, who&s;e eyes were upon me, gave a loud &s;hriek; but when he &s;aw me &s;afe, he called out to my pre&s;erver&mdash;Well handled, my brave fellow! keep hold of what you've got; you de&s;erve her for your pains.&mdash;Whether it was this raillery of my brother's, or the alarm of my danger, or what el&s;e I know not, but he had no &s;ooner &s;et me on my feet, than the colour went from his cheeks, his whole frame trembled, and if he had not &s;quatted down upon the &s;teps, I think verily he would have fainted. I con|fe&s;s to you I was very much touched with his &s;en&s;ibility, and &s;o was Arundel.&mdash;Lord S. ran down to the river-&s;ide, and cried out,&mdash;My dear Mortlake, I hope you are not hurt.&mdash;By this time he was recovering, and having a&s;&s;ured my brother that no harm had befallen either of us, we walked up the garden lawn to the hou&s;e. We entered the library by a gla&s;s door, and in my life I was never &s;o enchanted with the elegant &s;implicity and proportion of
<PB N="90" REF="91">
a room before. By the preparations for the books, it &s;hould &s;eem the collection is con&s;i|derable, and I am told they are very well &s;e|lected; in &s;hort, they are worthy both of the giver and receiver. Nobody can be&s;tow with &s;uch a grace as Arundel; nobody can apply them to better purpo&s;e than Mortlake. We went over the hou&s;e, and I am charmed with every part of it; the bed-rooms, a dre&s;&s;ing-room and drawing-room, are yet unfur|ni&s;hed, and Mr. Arundel &s;aid, he had drawn me thither on purpo&s;e to avail him&s;elf of my ta&s;te in the choice of the papers and cottons, of which he laid before me a variety of pat|terns. Help us out, I be&s;eech you, Lady Jane, &s;aid he, for we college drones are but &s;orry judges in the&s;e matters.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I &s;ate down to examine a large par|cel of the&s;e &s;amples, one of the workmen called Mr. Arundel out of the room; and how it was I know not, but I confe&s;s to you, my dear Loui&s;a, I felt a little queeri&s;h ju&s;t now, finding my&s;elf alone with a very hand&s;ome and a very young man, in the awkward office of chu&s;ing beds and curtains, whil&s;t he was folding and unfolding and hovering about
<PB N="91" REF="92">
me; &s;o I fairly threw the work a&s;ide for the time, and told him I would wait till Mr. Arundel returned. Mortlake, who&s;e &s;en&s;ibi|lity nothing can e&s;cape, and who perhaps had not quite recovered his former agitation, now blu&s;hed like &s;carlet, and I have no doubt I looked &s;illy enough, for I confe&s;s my bro|ther's words, though probably &s;poken in mere plea&s;antry, without meaning, had put my heart into no &s;mall flutter. In this &s;ituation we both &s;tood &s;ilent for a time, and irre&s;olute what to &s;ay or do next. On the&s;e occa&s;ions a woman generally is the fir&s;t to find her tongue, and I began to talk of the e&s;cape I had had, and to thank him for his care and protection of me, which I was afraid had oc|ca&s;ioned him &s;ome pain or hurt, which he did not own to.&mdash;He a&s;&s;ured me that he felt no pain but what aro&s;e from my danger, and even the apprehen&s;ion of any harm befalling me, was more than he could bear.&mdash;But we mu&s;t not tru&s;t you to the boat any more, added he, and I will de&s;ire Arundel to &s;end for his carriage to take you home by the road. I had now recovered from my embara&s;&s;ment, and calling him back as he was going out of
<PB N="92" REF="93">
the room, declared again&s;t the carriage, tell|ing him we &s;hould never hear an end of the old Captain's raillery, if we gave the cau&s;e up &s;o cowardly: be&s;ides, added I, it would be|tray a want of confidence in my conductor, which would be very ingrateful in me to do. 'Tis your conductor, replied he, who wants confidence in him&s;elf, when he has &s;uch a trea&s;ure in his charge.&mdash;Nay, an&s;wered I, but what will my brother &s;ay to that, if you de&s;ert a &s;tation which he commanded you to keep; won't there be &s;omething like mutiny in that?&mdash;Ah Madam, he replied, if Lord S. pro|motes me to an honor &s;o infinitely above my merits, how ought an humble man to act in &s;uch a ca&s;e?&mdash;I dare &s;ay, &s;aid I, Lord S. is too good a judge of merit, not to know that humility is one of the &s;ure&s;t marks which be|long to it.&mdash;Mr. Arundel now returned, and put a &s;top to a conver&s;ation that was growing rather &s;erious. We now pa&s;&s;ed a few minutes longer in the hou&s;e, took a walk round the garden, and repa&s;&s;ing the river, found a car|riage in waiting for us on the park &s;ide and &s;o returned to the hou&s;e together.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94">Immediately on my arrival, a &s;ervant gave me the following letter, which completely ve|rifies your prediction.</P>

<P>Lady Jane S. pre&s;ents her compliments to Sir Adam Crichton, and begs leave to decline the honor of any further corre&s;pon|dence with him upon the &s;ubject, which his letter alludes to.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This I di&s;patched by his &s;ervant, and hoped to hear no more of my lover; when behold, in le&s;s than the &s;pace of half an hour, a &s;ervant announced him to Mr. Arundel, who &s;eemed much &s;urprized at the name of a vi&s;itor, to whom he was a perfect &s;tranger;
<PB N="95" REF="96">
but as there was no he&s;itation to be made, in point of politene&s;s, about receiving him, or|ders were given to &s;hew Sir Adam Crichton into the room. Lord S. had ju&s;t time to whi&s;per a few words to Mr. Arundel, when the gentleman made his entrance into the room where we were all a&s;&s;embled; the old Captain and Mortlake being ju&s;t then en|gaged at the backgammon table, and paying little attention to what was going forward. As &s;oon as Sir Adam had made his apologies to Mr. Arundel, which he performed with a great deal of civil circumlocution, he a&s;ked leave to &s;peak with me alone; upon which my brother demanded, if he had not had an an&s;wer from Lady Jane already? he acknow|ledged to have received a &s;hort note; but hoped I would yet indulge him with an op|portunity of explaining him&s;elf. Upon this Arundel and Mortlake ro&s;e up, and were preparing to leave the room; but as I was re&s;olute again&s;t any conver&s;ation with him, I reque&s;ted them to &s;tay, for that Sir Adam and I had no private bu&s;ine&s;s whatever. Lord S. now addre&s;&s;ed him in a &s;erious tone as fol|lows:&mdash;Sir Adam Crichton, you have heard

my &s;i&s;ter's re&s;olution; and therefore I mu&s;t on her behalf in&s;i&s;t upon it, that you do not pre&s;s her with another word upon the &s;ubject: upon the&s;e conditions, if you chu&s;e to honor us with your company, I think I may an&s;wer for my friend Mr. Arundel, that all civilities will be paid to Sir Adam Crichton in his hou&s;e.&mdash;Certainly, if Sir Adam will do me that honor, &s;aid Mr. Arundel, yet coolly enough.&mdash;The old Captain, who did not under&s;tand a word of all this, was bawling out to Mortlake to re&s;ume his game at backgammon; but in vain, I never &s;aw &s;o re&s;tle&s;s a creature, he was in all parts of the room by turns, and never quiet in any. Ob&s;erving this, the Com|mander grew out of patience, and being to|tally in the dark, and not over quick at &s;ee|ing into the cau&s;es and rea&s;ons of things, vo|ciferated &s;till louder, crying out, Come, come, Doctor, bear a hand; where the plague art capering to? What the dickens is all this to thee? Don't run away from the game, when I have a gammon in my tables?</P>
<P>During this a perfect &s;ilence had reigned in our quarter, whil&s;t Sir Adam's eyes had gone a progre&s;s round the room, &s;ometimes look|ing

inqui&s;itively at my brother, then piteou&s;ly at me, then enviou&s;ly at Arundel, honoring me, as I believe, with a &s;u&s;picion that he had &s;pied out a rival; and very naturally con|cluding, from the &s;uperiority he there beheld, that his cau&s;e mu&s;t be hopele&s;s, he ro&s;e at length from his chair without uttering a word, made a very awkward bow and de|parted.</P>
<P>Mr. Arundel followed him to the hall door, performing all the rights of ho&s;pitality with great politene&s;s, when the Baronet as he was parting took courage and &s;aid&mdash;I perceive, Sir, you are the happy man; to which your friend made reply&mdash;I am indeed, Sir, every body mu&s;t be happy in the &s;ociety of Lady Jane S.&mdash;There's a declaration for you?

<HEAD>LETTER LXXIII. Lady Jane S. to Lady Loui&s;a G.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE had a lecture from Lady Tre|ville this morning: Do you know, my dear Jane, &s;ays &s;he, that you are making poor Mortlake mo&s;t compleatly in love with you? now this I mu&s;t chide you for, becau&s;e, take notice, though it may be &s;port to you, it is death to him.</P>
<P>But perhaps I do not mean to let him die.</P>
<P>Then what do you mean, you giddy crea|ture?</P>
<P>Any thing rather than incur your di&s;plea|&s;ure and give you ju&s;t occa&s;ion for chiding me; which, if I was capable of playing the coquette with &s;o excellent a creature, I &s;hould richly de&s;erve.</P>
<P>The Lord be good unto me! my dear girl, why, he is a par&s;on.</P>
<P>Very true; and Sir Adam Crichton is a Ba|ronet, and I am an Earl's daughter, and yet I
<PB N="100" REF="101">
can de&s;pi&s;e the man of money and admire the man of merit.</P>
<P>Well to be &s;ure this is mighty fine and ro|mantic, but you are je&s;ting with me all this while.</P>
<P>Pardon me, my dear Lady, you have taken the very way to make me &s;erious; for if you are founded in your ob&s;ervation, and I have really made the impre&s;&s;ion upon Mortlake's heart which you &s;u&s;pect, I have not that trivial mind to revolt from his profe&s;&s;ion, or &s;light a virtuous man becau&s;e devoted to the &s;ervice of his God. Shall the colour of a man's cloaths, or the cut of his hair di&s;gu&s;t my vani|ty, and decide again&s;t a character, in which every perfection of heart and head, every ex|cellence of mind and per&s;on apparently unite? If I am to con&s;ult my eye, where can it re&s;t upon a finer per&s;on than Mortlake's? if I am to be guided by my judgment, can it direct me to a worthier choice?</P>
<P>But a par&s;on's wife, my dear&mdash;Only think of Lady Jane S. young, noble, blooming, beauteous, the admiration of the whole town, the pattern of all elegance and the &s;oul of all &s;ocieties&mdash;a par&s;on's wife.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">And why not? If Lady Jane prefers tran|quillity to di&s;&s;ipation, &s;olid happine&s;s to fleeting plea&s;ures; if Lady Jane prefers the ble&s;&s;ings of the poor to the admiration of the town; Lady Jane will not regret that &s;he is no longer the &s;oul of tho&s;e &s;ocieties, which her &s;oul can|not approve; and though &s;he does not mean to le&s;&s;en her attentions to elegance, yet as a pat|tern of it &s;he would not wi&s;h to be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed, whil&s;t there are &s;o many nobler patterns for her emulation.</P>
<P>But your family, my dear child, your noble, I may &s;ay, your royal blood!&mdash;then above all, the Earl your brother! he will now expect to e&s;tabli&s;h you in &s;ome great connection; you &s;aw with what indignity he &s;purned at the al|liance of Sir Adam Crichton; what will he &s;ay to that of Mortlake?</P>
<P>You mi&s;take my brother's motives for treat|ing Sir Adam's propo&s;als with contempt; the man, not his alliance, is contemptible: my bro|ther will not &s;eek out matches of intere&s;t or am|bition for me; he is too honorable to wi&s;h to en&s;lave my affections, and he knows my &s;pirit too well to attempt it; the authority he holds with me is of my giving, not of his exacting;
<PB N="102" REF="103">
it &s;prings from the love I bear him, from the opinion I entertain of his judgment and the re|verence I pay to his virtues; but neither he, nor any creature living or that ever did live, &s;hall pre&s;cribe to me in that important choice, which is to decide the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of my fu|ture days; much le&s;s will I be &s;wayed from my judgment by the de&s;picable pride of fa|mily, the &s;ordid lure of intere&s;t, or &s;illy cry of fa&s;hion, which looks no further than the &s;ur|face of the man, and cannot &s;ee the light of the &s;oul, if the body be habited in black.</P>
<P>Now then we are agreed, concluded the old lady; I have played a little harmle&s;s artifice upon you, and have touched methinks upon every point that could probe the feelings of a woman of di&s;tinction, circum&s;tanced as you are. Had I found you tender in any part, and &s;hrinking from the touch, I had trembled for your danger; but you have even bettered my very be&s;t opinion, and are more than ever dear to me.&mdash;And now, changing her tone and countenance in a moment, &s;he began to railly me about the &s;implicity of my dre&s;s, which &s;he &s;aid was all &s;ubtlety and contrivance, that I might not awe a mode&s;t lover by appearances
<PB N="103" REF="104">
&mdash;and there in truth &s;he was not out of her gue&s;s&mdash;I am &s;ure, &s;he &s;aid, this white linen &s;urplice and ve&s;tal hood, with all their cha&s;te accompaniments are levelled at the par&s;onage; but you are mi&s;taken, child, in their effect; in&s;tead of hiding they enhance your charms; Lady Jane in her court dre&s;s is only a fine wo|man, in this &s;aint-like habit &s;he is &s;omething more, and though a heathen prie&s;t in the &s;pirit of enthu&s;ia&s;m might prevail upon him&s;elf to &s;acrifice you as a victim at the altar, no Chri&s;|tian prie&s;t will ever venture to approach &s;o &s;piritualized a being with the carnal ideas of love. My life upon it, the humble Mortlake will not dare to approach you any otherwi&s;e than on his knees.&mdash;And if he does approach me on his knees, my dear lady, I replied, he will not find me &s;o &s;piritualized as you &s;eem to make me: I have hitherto kept love at a di&s;|tance, or at be&s;t played with him as a child with her kitten; when Sir Adam knelt at my feet I could have gone on with my needle and not pricked my fingers; I could have counted the buttons upon his coat, or numbered every curl in his hair, he might have moulded my hand between his till he was weary without
<PB N="104" REF="105">
putting my pul&s;e out of its pace; but oh Hea|vens! if a finger of this charming fellow does but touch my glove, it &s;ets my heart into a flutter, and when he caught me in his arms as I was falling into the river, how did I wi&s;h he would have taken my brother at his word and held me there for life!</P>
<P>Heyday, heyday! &s;he cried, &s;tark &s;taring mad already; why this is next kin to love at fir&s;t &s;ight.&mdash;Well, well, &s;uch things may have been, but they are too long pa&s;t for me to re|member them. However &s;ince it is &s;o, you have no time to throw away, chu&s;e your papers and your printed cottons, and &s;et the uphol|&s;terer to work as fa&s;t you can, before he has done his job, you will be ready for your's, or I am mi&s;taken.&mdash;But come, my dear, let us go down to breakfa&s;t; too much love upon an empty &s;tomach is not good for the con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>This learned dialogue had kept our tongues &s;o long in motion, that when we came into the breakfa&s;t room we found the gentlemen wait|ing for us, and were &s;aluted by the old Cap|tain with a whi&s;tle to the tune of the boat&s;wain, when he pipes all hands to the me&s;s. As I

was about to &s;eat my&s;elf at the table where I was to officiate, Mortlake ran with a chair for me, though a man with more ob&s;ervation and le&s;s zeal might ea&s;ily have found out there was no want of it; I am afraid I had already &s;ate down, but you know a lady may have a pre|ference for &s;uch a trifle as an odd chair, and &s;o to make &s;hort of a trifle, I quitted my own and took his. Immediately my wicked bro|ther cried out&mdash;Mortlake, there is promotion for you, Jane has &s;hifted her flag, and you have nothing to do but take po&s;t by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.&mdash;I can only &s;ay he did not avail him&s;elf of the hint; but having full employment in com|bating my own embara&s;&s;ment I cannot give any account how Mortlake di&s;po&s;ed of his.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t my brother drew me out into the garden, and during our walk we had the following conver&s;ation:</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf, my dear Jane, now you have di&s;carded your unworthy lover you mean to &s;upply the vacancy in your heart with one more de&s;erving.</P>
<P>Ah, brother! love you know is like <HI>death, the nece&s;&s;ary end, it will come when it will come.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="107">And have you no hints and intimations of his approach at pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>Humph! that is a trapping que&s;tion me|thinks; do you &s;py out any &s;uch?</P>
<P>Why to &s;ay the truth I &s;u&s;pect you have a little inclination to cro&s;s the water.</P>
<P>Aye, but you &s;ee I &s;tumbled in the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>True, but it was only to fall into a young man's arms; it was &s;o that William the Nor|man &s;tumbled upon Engli&s;h ground at his landing, but remember it was a lucky omen, for he conquered and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;oil he fell on.</P>
<P>And did you mean to make a ca&s;e in point, when you bid my pre&s;erver keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what he had &s;aved?</P>
<P>Upon my honor, Jane, if you can &s;ee your happine&s;s in humble life, my pride will never &s;tand in the way of it; &s;o you can but dwell with content, whether it is in a palace or a par&s;onage I &s;hall equally rejoice.&mdash;Perhaps I &s;hould not have &s;aid quite &s;o much awhile ago, but &s;ince I have now fortune &s;ufficient to make you affluent with the man of your choice, be his condition what it may, if that man's

<P>There &s;poke my brother! I exclaimed, and at the &s;ame time cla&s;ped him in my arms&mdash;this it is to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;oul of a hero. But now deal freely with me, my dear Archibald, I added; and as my heart is open, all its warmth and all its weakne&s;s as well known to you as the features of my face, have you &s;een any thing in me, have you di&s;covered any thing in Mortlake, which &s;eems to threaten future di&s;content between us? Have you any alarm for our happine&s;s? What is there in my&s;elf to correct, what in him to di&s;approve and guard my&s;elf again&s;t?</P>
<P>I will an&s;wer you &s;incerely; and for your&s;elf fir&s;t&mdash;If I did not know you as I do, I might &s;uppo&s;e your character was ill adapted to the &s;ober line of life, in which he moves; I might

Though his &s;pirit is gentle, it is as highly empa&s;&s;ioned and as warm, my &s;weet Jane, even as your own: his &s;oul is all benevolence, his religion is phi|lanthropy, active, liberal, tolerating, untainted by hypocri&s;y, and not clouded by gloom, but lively, gay and &s;ocial.

<P>ALAS! that mine &s;hould be the de&s;tiny to bla&s;t the happine&s;s of tho&s;e I love, to put to hazard, perhaps, (Oh horror beyond thought!) to de&s;troy a life far dearer to me than my own.</P>
<P>Arundel hath been repre&s;ented to me as the vile&s;t of men, mu&s;t I add! as the &s;educer, the violator of my mother's honor. The cir|cum&s;tances, reported to me by my father, ori|ginate from Sir George Revel, and are &s;imply the&s;e:&mdash;</P>
<P>A note from my mother to Arundel, written at the in&s;tant of her departure, was intercepted by Sir George Revel on the &s;pot, who arrived at her hou&s;e ju&s;t after &s;he had left it, and found means to get this letter out of the &s;er|vant's hands, who was entru&s;ted to deliver it.</P>
<P>This letter I &s;aw in her own hand-writing, and read it my&s;elf&mdash;It is little el&s;e than a &s;hort
<PB N="118" REF="119">
adieu; &s;he wi&s;hes him not to aggravate Lord G.; &s;he conjures him to avoid fre&s;h di&s;&s;en|&s;ions with Sir George Revel, but &s;he plainly hints at intelligence heretofore imparted to him by her&s;elf with re&s;pect to me&mdash;This is the whole of it, and this alone would have been an attack, I could ea&s;ily enough have put by in &s;ilence, had it not been followed by other cir|cum&s;tances, fabricated by the very father of lies, the author of all mi&s;chief; for that wretch, Sir George Revel, pretends he has a depo&s;ition of the &s;ervant, from whom he got the letter, charging my guiltle&s;s mother with a criminal a&s;&s;ignation, and meeting with Arundel in a certain building within a grove, adjoining to her garden, and a&s;&s;erting that of this meeting he was an eye-witne&s;s.</P>
<P>Such is my per&s;ua&s;ion of the purity and honor of the parties concerned, that had I no other grounds for di&s;believing this abomi|nable and malicious fiction, I could not harbour a &s;u&s;picion to their prejudice; but when I call to mind the zeal with which &s;he recommends my union with Arundel, and the prayers &s;he offers up for its &s;ucce&s;s, is it in nature to &s;up|po&s;e this accu&s;ation can be true? Is there a

parent living &s;o devoid of con&s;cience? If to the di&s;grace of human nature &s;uch a mon&s;ter does exi&s;t, it cannot be my mother. Another circum&s;tance there is, which &s;tamps the horrid tale with fal&s;ehood; the informer has di&s;ap|peared, and as the whole charge re&s;ts upon the hear&s;ay evidence and veracity of Sir George Revel, who does not deny that he con|nived at the fellow's e&s;cape by promi&s;e pre|viou&s;ly engaged, we are left to conclude that either no &s;uch informer exi&s;ts, and the entire &s;tory is a malicious fabrication of Sir George's, or el&s;e that there is &s;uch gro&s;s and palpable &s;ubornation in the ca&s;e, that the fugitive, con|&s;cious of his perjury, dares not abide the &s;crutiny, nor meet the accu&s;ed face to face.</P>
<P>But all this while, glaring as the&s;e circum|&s;tances are, my father credits, or pretends to credit, the tale, and the reputation of my in|nocent mother is to be bla&s;ted through the world, whenever he thinks fit to appeal to it, and divert the public odium from him&s;elf to her. Can this be &s;uffered? rather let me a&s;k, Can it be prevented otherwi&s;e than by appeal|ing to Arundel? And yet what horrors ago|nize my heart, when I reflect upon the dan|ger
<PB N="120" REF="121">
of that mea&s;ure! Alas, my friend, this di&s;appointed, de&s;perate man thir&s;ts for his blood; my fatal preference dooms him to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in's &s;word; I am the murderer of Arun|del.</P>
<P>This is the diabolical plot, which that wretch has been hatching in his journey into Kent; Heaven forbid I &s;hould &s;ay my father is an ac|complice in it, truth compels me to own that he is the willing dupe of it. To what pur|po&s;e then &s;hould I be &s;ilent towards you, or you towards Arundel? for if it comes not to his ears through my channel, it will through my father, who affects to credit it; it will be char|ged upon him by that mon&s;ter, who avows it and provokes me to reveal it.</P>
<P>Were any one but my&s;elf the reporter of it to Arundel, how would he be a&s;&s;ured of my entire rejection and abhorrence of the fal&s;e|hood? Silence might give him a &s;u&s;picion that I was ba&s;e enough to doubt, whereas I am prepared to give him full, compleat and unequivocal proof of confidence, by making common cau&s;e with him, and throwing my|&s;elf re&s;olutely into the arms of the very man whom they accu&s;e: yes, Arundel, be this my

<P>Can the daughter wed with the corrupter of the mother? this is their language. My na|ture &s;hudders at the thought&mdash;Be this the te&s;t then of my confidence in Arundel! I will &s;take my &s;oul upon his truth: Can I depo&s;e more &s;trongly to his innocence? Oaths may be given for purpo&s;es, friends have been perjured for friends; but who ever drew &s;uch horrors on their head, as I now invoke on mine upon the i&s;&s;ue of this fal&s;ehood? Glaring as hell it|&s;elf mu&s;t be the lie, that I would at &s;uch peril refute.</P>
<P>Exert your&s;elf for a friend, who&s;e heart is rent with agonies; con&s;ult your noble bro|ther; devi&s;e &s;ome means for preventing the ef|fu&s;ion of blood, dearer than that which flows from my afflicted heart; &s;ay to Arundel that I am ready to e&s;cape with him to that a&s;y|lum of fond fugitives, which till now I ne|ver

<P>OUR noble friend, Lord S. has had two fruitle&s;s interviews with Sir George Re|vel. He will not, nay I am per&s;uaded he cannot, produce the informer; he is him&s;elf the author and contriver of the calumny.</P>

<P>It was demanded of Sir George, if he would accompany my friend to the hou&s;e of Lord G. recapitulate the charge in his pre|&s;ence, as he pretends to have heard it from the mouth of the informer, meet the evidence which Lord S. was provided with for refuting the fal&s;ehood of the charge, and upon that proof acknowledge him&s;elf to have been mi&s;|informed and deceived.&mdash;He would accede to no one particular of this propo&s;ition; he abided in his belief, he retraced no one item

of what he had &s;aid, he would not produce the informer, he repented not of having inter|cepted the letter, but repented only of having ever in time pa&s;t made an apology to a man, whom it would have been a merit to have &s;ent out of the world, before he had com|mitted &s;uch crimes as render him unfit to re|main in it.</P>

<P>IT is as I predicted; ju&s;tice hath &s;truck the blow: the affair is over, and Sir George Revel, de&s;perately wounded in two places, can &s;carce be &s;aid to &s;urvive.</P>
<P>The &s;pot our &s;econds made choice of for our meeting was about a mile from the Au|&s;trian barrier, in the center of a &s;mall grove, not above a hundred paces from the road-&s;ide, where we left our carriages in waiting, with a &s;ervant in each, none but our re&s;pective &s;e|conds and &s;urgeons accompanying us to the ground.</P>
<P>It was between five and &s;ix in the morning when Lord S. and my&s;elf arrived upon the ground; and in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour Sir George appeared, with his friend in the Au&s;trian uniform, and a foreign regimental &s;urgeon.</P>
<P>When we were within a few paces of each

other he &s;topt, and I took off my hat to him, which he returned in like manner with his, throwing it, however, behind him to &s;ome di&s;|tance at the &s;ame time. Seeing him do this, I took for granted he was getting him&s;elf ready to &s;et to without lo&s;s of time, and there|upon began to &s;trip my&s;elf to a linen wai&s;t|coat; when addre&s;&s;ing me by my name, he cried out&mdash;Hold a moment with your leave; I de&s;ire the true grounds of my quarrel with you may be under&s;tood: you are a ra&s;h, pre|&s;umptuous young man; and it is to cha&s;ti&s;e your arrogance in a&s;piring to be my rival with Lady Loui&s;a, that I come hither: as for your connection with Lady G.

<P>As &s;oon as he &s;aid this, I called upon my friend Lord S. to take notice of his words and remember them. I &s;peak them for that very purpo&s;e, replied he; his Lord&s;hip is welcome to make what u&s;e of them he &s;ees fit: I take away no lady's reputation; I di&s;|dain it.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">Certify what you now &s;ay, and give it me under your hand, I exclaimed, and I am &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>No, Sir, an&s;wered he, it is for the vin|dication of my own character, it is for the honor of truth, I &s;ay this, not for your &s;ati&s;|faction: I have made one apology too many already, and you &s;hall never have another from me: I am not come &s;o far to make a childi&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s of it; I am determined to correct your in&s;olence, and a&s;&s;ert my own &s;u|perior claim to Lady Loui&s;a; &s;light mea&s;ures won't &s;erve me: your temerity has cho&s;en a weapon I am ma&s;ter of; that, and only that, &s;hall now decide upon our lives and our pre|ten&s;ions.</P>
<P>Having &s;o &s;aid, he threw off his coat and wai&s;tcoat, and both drawing our &s;words at the &s;ame in&s;tant, we advanced upon each other as men determined to conquer or to die.</P>
<P>He did him&s;elf no more than ju&s;tice i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> what he &s;aid; he was indeed a ma&s;ter of his weapon, and, having &s;ome advantage of the higher ground, pre&s;&s;ed upon me &s;o fiercely, and at the &s;ame time kept &s;o &s;trong a guard, that I found it nece&s;&s;ary to give back for a
<PB N="137" REF="138">
while, and wait his on&s;et on the defen&s;ive. In this way I continued to foil him &s;o fre|quently, that he began to lo&s;e his temper; which Sir John Macarthy More ob&s;erving, called to him to fight more coolly; for which he was taken up pretty &s;martly by my friend the Earl of S. who warned him to be &s;ilent. At this moment, with a vehement oath, he made a home-thru&s;t at my brea&s;t, which I contrived to pa&s;s over my &s;houlder, and in the in&s;tant pu&s;hed my &s;word through his body, clo&s;ing in upon him with the &s;ame motion: he reeled with the blow, and in falling caught hold with his left hand and pulled me to the ground upon him: I held fa&s;t of his right wri&s;t, &s;o that he could not u&s;e his &s;word, which he &s;truggled to recover from my gripe. In the &s;ame moment I heard the cla&s;hing of &s;words over my back as I laid upon the body of my antagoni&s;t, and found our &s;econds were engaged; I &s;prung upon my legs, and quitting hold of Sir George, whom I believed to be expiring, ex|tricated my &s;word from his body, and ru&s;hed between them. His &s;urgeon now ran up to him, thinking him to be dying; but he
<PB N="138" REF="139">
rai&s;ing him&s;elf nimbly on his legs, called out to him to be gone, and I had by this time parted our &s;econds: Sir George Revel once more attacked me with the fury of a de&s;perate man in his la&s;t moments; his countenance was horrible, he yelled with agony and fought like one that was frantic, whil&s;t the blood &s;pouted from his wound; &s;till there was di&s;|cretion in his madne&s;s, for his art had not de|&s;erted him to the la&s;t, and his attack for a &s;hort time was more dangerous than ever: I com|manded my&s;elf &s;o far as to &s;pare him upon two or three openings, for I wi&s;hed not to give him another wound; but &s;elf-pre&s;ervation put me upon other mea&s;ures, and coming &s;uddenly within his guard I lodged my point in his right brea&s;t, pa&s;&s;ing it clear through the fle&s;h of his &s;word arm and pinning it as it were to his ribs; his weapon dropt from his hand, and he fell backwards on the ground at his length, crying out, he was killed.</P>
<P>His &s;econd ran to him and &s;upported him till the &s;urgeon came up: he di&s;charged great|ly from the mouth, and then clo&s;ing his eyes fell back and as I thought in that moment expired. I intreated, I implored Sir John not
<PB N="139" REF="140">
to think of renewing any di&s;agreement with my friend, and that more blood might not be &s;pilt upon a quarrel that, by the evidence of the dying man, which he him&s;elf had heard him deliver, might have been atoned for with|out the&s;e fatal con&s;equences. I called upon Mr. L * * *, my &s;urgeon, and reque&s;ted him to give his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the dying man; this he very readily complied with, and the foreign &s;urgeon &s;oon di&s;covering how much more ex|pert he was than him&s;elf, re&s;igned the chief part of the work to him, and acted rather as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant than principal, applauding him in very high terms all the while. The opera|tion was indeed like magic; the &s;luices were &s;taunched, the wounds were bound up, and a reviving cordial was admini&s;tered almo&s;t at the &s;ame in&s;tant: the wounded man opened his eyes, and gave &s;igns of coming to his &s;en&s;es.&mdash;I conjure you, Sir, cried Mr. L. on your life do not attempt to &s;peak, or &s;tir; be perfectly quiet, and I am not out of hope to &s;ave you.</P>
<P>My chai&s;e let down at the back and had conveniencies to &s;erve as a litter, which my friendly &s;urgeon had contrived for me in Lon|don:
<PB N="140" REF="141">
on the mattra&s;s we laid Sir George Revel, and &s;o conveyed him through the little grove to the chai&s;e in waiting, our valets a&s;|&s;i&s;ting us in carrying him. Whil&s;t this was in operation we di&s;covered a good deal of blood on the &s;leeve of Lord S.'s right arm, and upon examination found it proceeded from a &s;light puncture in the fle&s;h. This al&s;o my &s;urgeon dre&s;&s;ed upon the &s;pot; and now Sir John Ma|carthy More, perceiving that his &s;word had wounded him in the &s;cuffle, gallantly cried out&mdash;The great God forbid that I &s;hould draw blood from the veins of a Briti&s;h officer whil&s;t I have life: give me your hand, my &s;weet boy, and may you live to fight your country's bat|tles and conquer like a brave fellow as you are; for by my faith and &s;oul you have ene|mies enough and to &s;pare (the devil fire them all) without my turning again&s;t you.&mdash;Lord S. readily &s;hook hands with him, and thus to my great &s;atisfaction a reconciliation took place between them.</P>
<P>When we had placed Sir George Revel in the chai&s;e, we had two miles to the next vil|lage, and the &s;urgeons &s;eemed to think it doubtful if he could bear the carriage &s;o far.
<PB N="141" REF="142">
There was a hou&s;e within &s;ight, at the bottom of one of the avenues in the grove, where we fought, which by its &s;ituation and appearance &s;eemed to belong to the owner of the place, and as it was &s;o near at hand Mr. L. advi&s;ed us to apply for admi&s;&s;ion there, as no time was to be lo&s;t. Sir John Macarthy More im|mediately mounted one of our &s;ervants hor&s;es, and in a few minutes returned to tell us, that he had &s;ucceeded in obtaining a reception for the wounded gentleman and his &s;urgeons, but that the lady of the hou&s;e recommended it to me and my &s;econd to get within the barrier as fa&s;t as we could.</P>
<P>As Sir George's danger was &s;o pre&s;&s;ing and his &s;urgeon very anxiou&s;ly &s;olicited the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of Mr. L. I con&s;ented to relea&s;e him upon his a&s;&s;uring me that no harm could be|fall Lord S. who&s;e wound was perfectly &s;afe and would want no dre&s;&s;ing till the next morn|ing, when at farthe&s;t he would not fail to be with us; having appointed therefore our place of meeting in the town of &mdash;, Lord S. and I drove off in Sir George Revel's chai&s;e, leav|ing him in mine to the care of the &s;urgeons
<PB N="142" REF="143">
and his friend Sir John, who &s;lowly proceeded with him down the avenue towards the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Being now &s;afely lodged at O&s;tend, and by the ble&s;&s;ing of Providence unhurt, except by my anxiety for Sir George, I &s;end this to you by expre&s;s, hoping that it will &s;et your mind entirely at re&s;t, e&s;pecially as I can a&s;&s;ure you Lord S. is in no manner of danger from the wound in his arm, which though &s;light pre|vents him for the pre&s;ent from u&s;ing his pen: we &s;hall wait the event of a day or two, and then &s;et out for England.</P>

&s;ince the receipt of Arundel's letter in|clo&s;ed in your's, words cannot utter: my agonies were &s;uch as to alarm and melt my father's heart; his care of me has been tender in the extreme; he endeavoured to delude me out of my apprehen&s;ions, but in vain, the op|pre&s;&s;ion that weighed down his own &s;pirits was too vi&s;ible to e&s;cape my notice; it &s;ufficiently informed me what was pa&s;&s;ing in his own mind; the dreadful bu&s;ine&s;s in operation hung upon his con&s;cience: in his heart I am &s;ure he acquitted my mother even before the con|fe&s;&s;ion of Sir George Revel put her innocence out of doubt.</P>
<P>You will &s;tart when I tell you, that in the angui&s;h of my &s;oul I di&s;gui&s;ed not any of its mo&s;t &s;ecret affections, but avowed my love for Arundel openly and without re&s;erve in his hearing&mdash;and he heard it not with patience only, but with pity, with complacence&mdash;I de|voted my&s;elf by the mo&s;t &s;olemn vows to me|lancholy, to de&s;pair, to death it&s;elf, if Arundel &s;urvived not the impending conflict. I ex|po&s;ed to my father's &s;ight the letter I had received from him, and I made no &s;cruple to declare the offer I had de&s;perately tendered
<PB N="149" REF="150">
him of a clande&s;tine marriage: the horror which my father felt at this propo&s;al was con|verted into admiration, when he peru&s;ed the letter, wherein Arundel &s;o honorably declines the offer.&mdash;This man, cried he, compels me to admire him.&mdash;The&s;e words were as a &s;ignal to my eager &s;pirit to break forth; the torrent of my pa&s;&s;ion forced its way; I wept, entreat|ed, threw my&s;elf before his feet upon my knees, and called aloud on Heaven for its protection to Arundel, for its vengeance upon his mur|derer.&mdash;In this in&s;tant arrived a letter from your brother to my father, which announced the completion of my prayers; the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice was triumphant, innocence was re&s;cued from danger, guilt devoted to death; Heaven's hand was vi&s;ible; my grateful heart was over|powered by the vouch&s;afement, it pau&s;ed in reverence of the awful pre&s;ence; I &s;unk upon the floor and fainted in the effort of adora|tion.</P>
<P>And now, my Jane, do you demand of me if I &s;ympathize with you in pity and ap|plau&s;e of your heroic brother? Oh! from my &s;oul I love him.&mdash;May victory attend him ever! May &s;ame crown him with laurels,
<PB N="150" REF="151">
fortune enrich him with &s;poils! and for the generous blood he &s;hed for Arundel, it is as dear to me as <HI>the drops that fell from my &s;ad heart, the fountain of my life is not more pre|cious.</HI></P>
<P>Dear to me al&s;o is that other thunderbolt of war, that boi&s;terous &s;on of the ocean, brave old uncle John; nature has made him of pre|cious materials, though of rough workman|&s;hip; in antient time, I am told, our &s;ea officers were in general &s;uch as Captain Arundel is now; the modern cla&s;s, of which your noble Archibald is a bright example, are more courtly and no le&s;s courageous.</P>
<P>As for that piece of human excellence, who, being your Mortlake, is mine al&s;o, he &s;eems born to put complainers out of countenance and &s;hew the world how pure a man may be. That you have gained a trea&s;ure in his heart I can well believe, that he will meet a ble&s;&s;ing in your arms I am perfectly a&s;&s;ured: how the world may think fit to comment upon your choice will little concern you, when you have turned your back upon its vain and fooli&s;h opinions; if I thought that choice would be le&s;s happy for its being humble, I &s;hould
<PB N="151" REF="152">
think you had made a &s;acrifice to the pa&s;|&s;ion of the moment, but I know your nature is &s;uperior to ambition, envy, avarice and every &s;ordid propen&s;ity; I join with your be|loved Earl in every trait and de&s;cription of your character, and &s;ub&s;cribe my warme&s;t wi&s;hes to his for your &s;peedy union. Your's is a &s;pirit of activity and fire, it does not deal in delay; convinced of his love for you (and how indeed &s;hould that be doubted?) you mu&s;t di&s;|&s;ipate his timid diffidence, and conde&s;cend to copy the example of a &s;pirit far le&s;s heroic than your own, that of your poor trembling Loui&s;a, whom fear made bold, and love in|&s;pired with re&s;olution to offer her free heart to Arundel. You are now as it were alone with Mortlake, every hour you have him in your eye, opportunity courts you, and the time is your own: are, there no &s;eque&s;tered walks, no &s;hady groves,
<Q>No haunts propitious to the voice of love?</Q>
Sure they would &s;pring &s;pontaneou&s;ly where Arundel inhabits. Where is the &s;pot, in which you met him honoring my poor re&s;emblance with his flattering contemplation? that &s;pot
<PB N="152" REF="153">

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXIII. Lady Jane S. to Lady Loui&s;a G.</HEAD>
<P>BEGIN your temple without lo&s;s of time: Mortlake and I have con&s;ecrated the &s;pot to love, and nothing is wanting for the cere|mony of laying the foundation-&s;tone but the pre&s;ence of the patrone&s;s.</P>
<P>Let us rear our fane according to the cha&s;te &s;implicity of antient Greece; let us keep the e&s;tabli&s;hed orders to the purity of their text, without any modern interpolations, and, to make them corre&s;pond to the characters of the happy pair, who&s;e union they record, let the manly &s;olidity of the Doric &s;upport the female elegance of the Ionic.</P>
<P>Give your favorite painter an ample and unbroken area for the di&s;play of his genius; and, as the temple is to be &s;acred to connubial love, let him take the fable of <HI>P&s;yche</HI> and her various labours for his &s;ubject, con&s;ummating the whole with a magnificent compo&s;ition of

the wedding ceremony. Remember I bargain for a dome, as well for the painter's lights, as for the &s;olemnity of the edifice; and in a &s;a|cri&s;ty apart from the fane let me have the pourtrait of my Loui&s;a, &s;imple, unadorned, Caecilia-like, breathing harmony and in&s;piring love. I recollect &s;ome lines addre&s;&s;ed to the celebrated arti&s;t we are &s;peaking of, by a hu&s;|band as in&s;tructions for the pourtrait of his wife, which, till Arundel &s;upplies you with better, may &s;erve the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, with the &s;imple tran&s;po&s;ition of a name&mdash;

<L>And animate the canva&s;s with her eyes;</L>

<L>Catch her dear image from a hu&s;band's heart,</L>
<L>And draw her pure and faultle&s;s as thy art.</L></Q>
To confe&s;s the truth to you, I had once begun to think that there was no &s;uch thing as love in my nature: I had been often flattered by young men and &s;ometimes plea&s;ed, but I never liked any one well enough to &s;uffer pain for
<PB N="155" REF="156">
his &s;ake; no admirer ever broke my re&s;t by night, or &s;poiled one meal in the day by over-occupation of my thoughts: now Mortlake on the contrary ab&s;olutely &s;tarved me into a liking for him; a wild cat would have been tamed by the di&s;cipline he gave me; I &s;hould have died of mere inanition in a few days, if I had not made him &s;en&s;ible of my ca&s;e: but how to do this has been the ta&s;k; for the creature has none of that forward intuition, which many of our fa&s;hionable &s;parks have in &s;uch prematu|rity, that they pretend to &s;py out a lady's ma|lady before &s;he &s;ickens: he is &s;o humble, &s;o diffident of his own &s;kill, that I de&s;paired of making him even under&s;tand the &s;ymptoms; how then, my dear Loui&s;a, could I expect a cure?</P>
<P>Some days went over my head before I could fairly talk down this &s;ame empty title of mine, which &s;tood like a proud porter at the door of his lips and never let a word make its pa&s;&s;age, that did not pay the tax which form and ceremony exact: at la&s;t with much pains and labour I got a tack to my title, and he began occa&s;ionally to &s;ay&mdash;<HI>Dear Lady Jane: on that hint I &s;pake,</HI> and I kept more than pace with his
<PB N="156" REF="157">
familiarity by repaying him with&mdash;<HI>My dear Mr. Mortlake.</HI></P>
<P>I had a kind of commi&s;&s;ion going on at the par&s;onage, and we held frequent councils there in affairs of ta&s;te; we rambled together all over the garden, though it was not always to &s;uper|intend the works that we went thither; &s;ome|times the boat, in&s;tead of carrying us acro&s;s the &s;tream, wafted us down to new &s;cenes, where the pro&s;pect tempted us to moor our ve&s;&s;el and make excur&s;ions into the country; here our talk became tender and confidential; we interchanged the &s;tories of our lives, which, though not marked with extraordinary inci|dents, drew our hearts nearer to each other, and began to throw re&s;erve a&s;ide: wherever &s;hade and &s;olitude invited us to a temporary repo&s;e, I was commodiou&s;ly weary and we &s;ate down together to re&s;t our&s;elves: nature has a thou&s;and mode&s;t methods of explaining her&s;elf in the&s;e intere&s;ting &s;ituations; the verie&s;t no|vice in love will fall upon them in&s;tinctively, and there wants no comment to the language of the eyes: certain it is we lo&s;t no ground by the&s;e baiting-places, and it is my opinion we &s;hould have made a tedious journey of it with|out them.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158">I am now coming to the con&s;ecrated &s;pot, where your future temple is to ari&s;e; there is a hanging grove, which flanks the current of the &s;ilver Medway; here the bank is &s;teep and lofty, and there is a kind of rough alcove &s;haped out of the cliff, wherein is a matted bench, which &s;ome of Arundel's predece&s;&s;ors have maliciou&s;ly embowered with flowering &s;hrubs, which &s;o invitingly &s;urround it as to make it a perfect love-trap. From this very &s;eat your Arundel, I make no doubt, was re|turning, when we &s;urpri&s;ed him within a few yards of it, though we did not at that time di&s;cover it; but as he has not yet put up a board in the &s;uburban &s;tile to warn unwary in|truders again&s;t men-traps and pits, which the foot of curio&s;ity may fall into, poor Mortlake and my&s;elf, as any other unde&s;igning &s;ouls might have done, wandered heedle&s;sly into the mid&s;t of it, thinking no harm, and behold there we were caught! The river glided &s;ilent|ly at our feet, the breeze wafted odours and the birds chaunted their own fe&s;tive hymeneals around us.</P>
<P>This is a delicious retreat, &s;aid Mortlake, you &s;eem weary with your walk; the &s;un is
<PB N="158" REF="159">
hot, will you re&s;t your&s;elf in this &s;hady &s;eat?&mdash;I &s;aw my danger, but I am of a family, you know, not much given to fear, &s;o I accepted the challenge, and entered in <HI>nothing doubting:</HI> I &s;ate down on the matted bench, whil&s;t Mort|lake re&s;pectfully continued on his feet; 'twas an awkward arrangement, and methought we did not conver&s;e with ea&s;e in our different at|titudes; it was &s;elfi&s;h withal, &s;o I invited him to &s;it down be&s;ide me; now this &s;piteful bench was rather &s;tinted in its mea&s;ure for two &s;itters, unle&s;s they were very clo&s;e friends indeed; in making room for him we were tumbled toge|ther I know not how, and I &s;aw his cheeks &s;uffu&s;ed with blu&s;hes: to divert his emba|ra&s;&s;ment, and perhaps in &s;ome degree to re|lieve my own, I began with an affected air of indifference to &s;tart a conver&s;ation about his affairs at the par&s;onage; they &s;eemed to have &s;lipt his memory, I am not &s;ure he ju&s;t then knew whereabouts the par&s;onage &s;tood: I talked about the di&s;po&s;al of the furniture, which he had referred to my ta&s;te, and began to fit the chambers one by one; I might as well have talked to him of the chambers of
<PB N="159" REF="160">
King Solomon, his ideas could not &s;tir a &s;tep beyond the matted bench.</P>
<P>Why you are lo&s;t, my friend, cried I; What are you meditating upon? He &s;ighed and turned his eyes fondly upon me. I had my an|&s;wer without the co&s;t of a word. Ah, Mort|lake, &s;aid I, you have &s;omething at your heart, which you will not confide to me.&mdash;It is not fit I &s;hould, he replied: &s;end me for ever from your &s;ight, but pity me and for|give.&mdash;He was &s;ilent; his agitation affected me, it communicated it&s;elf to my heart, I could not &s;peak to him: he ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and &s;eemed he&s;itating if he &s;hould not leave me; I gave him a look, 'twas not a di&s;|couraging one, and he &s;ate down once more by my &s;ide&mdash;You do not treat me with your na|tural &s;incerity, I &s;aid, you do not hold me worthy of your thoughts.&mdash;Ah, Madam, he replied, the thoughts I entertain of your Lady|&s;hip are &s;uch as my tongue cannot find words expre&s;&s;ive enough to give utterance to; I know too well my own unworthine&s;s to di&s;|cour&s;e on &s;uch a &s;ubject, and I re&s;pect your delicacy too much to attempt it; meditation,

<P>If you only flatter me with your eyes, I an|&s;wered, &s;uch flattery will not be &s;erious to either of us; but if your heart approves of me, I tru&s;t you do not think me proud, mercenary or ambitious. Of the&s;e bad qualities I hope I have acquitted my&s;elf in part at lea&s;t, to your conviction, for Sir Adam Crichton is ex|tremely rich, and I am very poor; he is noble withal as far as birth can ennoble him: Do you think then my ambition a&s;pires yet higher? You think rightly; it a&s;pires to character, to under&s;tanding, to the true affections of a vir|tuous heart, on which I may repo&s;e my hap|pine&s;s; and that once found, what is the world to me?&mdash;Lovelie&s;t and be&s;t of all Hea|ven's works! he rapturou&s;ly exclaimed, and dropping on his knee cla&s;ped both my hands in his; Oh pardon me, he cried, I know not what I do; my pa&s;&s;ion is my ma&s;ter; you are too noble to de&s;pi&s;e an humble creature at

Come then, come hither with thine Arundel, here interchange your vows, and on the twice-con&s;ecrated ground erect the altar of connubial Love!</P>
<P>And now have I not obeyed the in&s;truc|tions in your la&s;t intere&s;ting letter? Your com|mands have precipitated my advances; but let me tell you with what joy I &s;ee your pro&s;|pect brighten, as your father relents; the courage, truth and genero&s;ity of Arundel mu&s;t triumph at la&s;t; may your next meet|ing be &s;peedy and propitious!

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXIV. Arundel to Charles Mortlake.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>London.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH Lord S. will be the bearer of this, who will give you the particulars of what has pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the date of my la&s;t letter to my uncle, I cannot excu&s;e my&s;elf from writing to you, as it is probable I may be detained in town &s;ome days to come, and I have &s;omething more to &s;ay than can well be conveyed by word of mouth.</P>
<P>My return to England was retarded by the anxious de&s;ire I had to wait the event of Sir George Revel's wounds: I thought his ca&s;e without hope, but I have now left him in a promi&s;ing way to find his cure from the hand of time and the great &s;kill of Mr. L. who has con&s;ented to &s;tay with him &s;ome time longer.</P>
<P>By one of the mo&s;t extraordinary incidents chance ever produced (if indeed it ought to be a&s;cribed to chance) it &s;o happened that the hou&s;e in the wood, to which he was conveyed
<PB N="164" REF="165">
from the ground we engaged on, was the very hou&s;e, to which that virtuous exile Lady G. had retired. I have not &s;een her nor had any corre&s;pondence with her by letter, but I learn from Sir John Macarthy More, that an old lady, the widow of a certain Baron Polberg, who was an intimate of her father's, is the pre|&s;ent owner of that hou&s;e and a &s;mall e&s;tate, which lies about it: with this lady &s;he has kept up an occa&s;ional corre&s;pondence and done her many friendly offices &s;ince the death of the Baron; to this retirement &s;he betook her&s;elf in her di&s;tre&s;s, and with this old lady &s;he boards, living in the &s;tricte&s;t privacy, and totally &s;eque&s;tered from all other &s;ociety.</P>
<P>When Sir George Revel was brought in wounded and expiring, &s;he generou&s;ly exerted her&s;elf for his relief, and, &s;uperior to all mo|tives of re&s;entment, furni&s;hed him with every thing her care and a&s;&s;iduity could contribute towards his comfort and accommodation. It is to the credit of human nature that Sir George was not in&s;en&s;ible to the&s;e acts of benignity, and in token of his repentance &s;eized the fir&s;t moments in his power for dictating a full re|cantation of the charge he had laid again&s;t
<PB N="165" REF="166">
her; this he addre&s;&s;ed to Lady Loui&s;a, and tran&s;mitted to me by the hands of Sir John Macarthy More, accompanied with a note, of which the following is a copy.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Sir George Revel tran&s;mits to Mr. Arun|del a paper addre&s;&s;ed to Lady Loui&s;a G. which he de&s;ires him to peru&s;e for his own &s;atisfaction before he pre&s;ents it to that lady; he hopes this acknowledgment, with the pain and danger he is now &s;uffering, will atone for all injuries.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>With this pacquet Sir John delivered me a verbal me&s;&s;age from Lady G. de&s;iring me to ha&s;ten my return to England, and a&s;&s;uring me every thing in her power &s;hould be done for the recovery of Sir George Revel; having made a &s;uitable reply to this me&s;&s;age, and writ|ten an an&s;wer to Sir George's note, Lord S. and I &s;et out on our return.</P>
<P>Upon our arrival in London Lord S. was &s;o good as to call upon Lord G. to explain to him the purport of the paper I was charged with from Sir George Revel, and to know from his Lord&s;hip if I was to have the honor of delivering this paper to Lady Loui&s;a with my own hands, or not. Lord G. &s;aid he could
<PB N="166" REF="167">
hardly &s;uppo&s;e a vi&s;it in his hou&s;e would be very agreeable to me: to which my friend re|plied, that as the whole of a very infamous proceeding again&s;t me jointly with Lady G. was now laid open, to his Lord&s;hip's full and perfect &s;atisfaction, he mu&s;t take the liberty to remark, it was but rea&s;onable for me to ex|pect &s;ome &s;uch acknowledgment on his part, might a&s;&s;ure me of his &s;u&s;picions being done away, and quiet my mind on a &s;ubject, which had expo&s;ed me to &s;o much unmerited danger and di&s;turbance. Lord G. very rea|dily admitted that &s;uch an acknowledgment was due to me, and that if I required it as an act of ju&s;tice, as &s;uch he could have no ob|jection to comply with it; but he doubted if Lady Loui&s;a was well enough to leave her chamber. An hour was then appointed for my coming, and Lord S. returned to me with this report.</P>
<P>I was punctual to the time, and was imme|diately admitted to his Lord&s;hip; who re|ceived me courteou&s;ly, but with a good deal of embara&s;&s;ment in his manner. He was alone, and apologized for Lady Loui&s;a, who was too ill to leave her chamber. I delivered
<PB N="167" REF="168">
Sir George Revel's pacquet into his hands, tell|ing him it had been &s;ent to me under a flying &s;eal, and &s;hewing him Sir George's note, wherein he de&s;ires me to peru&s;e it, and deli|ver it to its addre&s;s. He was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that &s;uch a depo&s;ition to the truth could not fail to be con&s;idered by him as a full and compleat exculpation of the parties, whom that unhappy man had &s;o unju&s;tly accu&s;ed. It was a foul tran&s;action, of which he &s;hould &s;ay the le&s;s, as the guilty per&s;on had &s;o dearly atoned for it. With re&s;pect to his Lady's conduct, he confe&s;&s;ed that her ha&s;ty e&s;cape out of England, and the &s;ecrecy &s;he ob&s;erved on that occa&s;ion, had been &s;taggering cir|cum&s;tances in his opinion; and he owned it put his credulity to &s;ome &s;tretch to believe that the choice of a &s;pot &s;o near her re&s;idence, and the conveying the wounded man to the very hou&s;e it&s;elf, were merely the effects of chance.&mdash;In an&s;wer to this, I a&s;&s;ured his Lord&s;hip in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that I was never once con&s;ulted in the choice of the ground, which was pointed out to Lord S. by Sir George's &s;econd, who was a foreign offi|cer,
<PB N="168" REF="169">
and well acquainted with the country; that for my own part, I had not the mo&s;t di&s;|tant gue&s;s at the place Lady G. had cho&s;en for her re&s;idence, before this event happened; and that neither my&s;elf, nor Lord S. on my behalf, had ever &s;een Lady G. entered her hou&s;e, or corre&s;ponded with her, &s;ince my leaving England till the pre&s;ent moment; and though the incident he alluded to was indeed a very extraordinary one, yet I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to his Lord&s;hip, that Providence oftentimes takes means as extraordinary for the vindi|cation of innocence and the detection of guilt. In this light I regarded the meeting of Sir George Revel and his much-injured Lady, who&s;e humanity, extending it&s;elf even to her wor&s;t enemy in his di&s;tre&s;s, wrought a happy change in that enemy's heart, by turning it to repentance, and drawing forth a confe&s;&s;ion mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable for her ju&s;tification and his Lord&s;hip's repo&s;e. Sen&s;ible that no one, who had &s;o abu&s;ed your confidence, I added, could with any face a&s;pire to your Lord&s;hip's alli|ance, Sir George Revel has very properly under&s;tood his &s;ituation, by withdrawing all
<PB N="169" REF="170">
preten&s;ions to Lady Loui&s;a, which is the pur|port of the letter I have had the honor to de|liver to you.</P>
<P>Mr. Arundel, he replied, whatever terms you and I may be upon now or hereafter, yet on this occa&s;ion I de&s;ire you will once for all receive my full and unre&s;erved declaration, that I give perfect credit to your veracity and honor; and I rejoice withal that you are re|turned in &s;afety and unhurt.&mdash;For this I thanked him, and declared my&s;elf perfectly &s;atisfied.&mdash;He then demanded if I was leaving town; and upon my &s;aying I had &s;ome bu&s;i|ne&s;s at the Admiralty on my uncle's account, which might detain me a day or two, he was plea&s;ed to an&s;wer, that he was glad of it, and hoped it was a promotion to a flag, which his gallant &s;ervices &s;o richly merited. This was al&s;o very courteous on his part, and I ex|pre&s;&s;ed my &s;en&s;ibility for his kind expre&s;&s;ions, informing him that I had &s;trong rea&s;on to be|lieve that promotion would take place.</P>
<P>Lord G. now took up the pacquet I had delivered to him, and ob&s;erved, that as I had apprized him of the contents, the matter did not &s;o pre&s;s but that I might make my own op|portunity
<PB N="170" REF="171">
for giving them in per&s;on to Lady Loui&s;a; and to confe&s;s the truth, &s;ays he, I have u&s;ed a little deceit in not informing her of this meeting, fearing that her &s;pirits were not in a proper &s;tate to undergo the agitation it would give her: I will therefore inform her of your arrival, and &s;he &s;hall let you know when &s;he is prepared to expect you.</P>
<P>I reque&s;ted him not to return Sir George's letter to me, but to give it to Lady Loui&s;a in my ab&s;ence, as it would be a more delicate time for her to peru&s;e it at her lei&s;ure; and I gave him my mo&s;t grateful thanks for the confidence he repo&s;ed in me, by allowing me to hope for the happine&s;s of paying my re|&s;pects to Lady Loui&s;a in per&s;on.</P>
<P>He very hand&s;omely replied, that he did not think he &s;hould ever repent of any confi|dence he repo&s;ed in me, having received &s;o &s;trong a proof of my very honorable con|duct towards his daughter, in an affair which &s;he had confided to him, and for which he held him&s;elf very &s;eriou&s;ly indebted to me.</P>
<P>I &s;tared with a&s;toni&s;hment at the&s;e words, which &s;eemed &s;o evidently to apply to a cer|tain propo&s;al I thought my&s;elf bound to de|cline,
<PB N="171" REF="172">
but which I could not have believed Lady Loui&s;a would have had the re&s;olution to di&s;clo&s;e to her father; and I own I augured very inau&s;piciou&s;ly from her &s;o doing; but the behavior of Lord G. was either very arti|ficial, or mo&s;t extremely encouraging, for we parted with &s;miles of complacency, and a promi&s;e on his &s;ide that I &s;hould very &s;oon hear from Lady Loui&s;a when &s;he would re|ceive my vi&s;it.</P>
<P>What can this my&s;terious behaviour por|tend? What am I to expect from this vi&s;it, &s;anctioned as it is by the authority of her father? Hath my declining her propo&s;al been &s;o mi&s;under&s;tood in its motives, as to have ex|cited her re&s;entment again&s;t me, and brought her to de&s;pi&s;e me for my want of &s;pirit? That would be hard indeed; I ought not &s;o to judge of her; and yet how el&s;e can I ac|count for her di&s;clo&s;ing it to her father, but as a peace-offering on her part, and a thorough renunciation of me for ever? Oh! Charles, my heart is tortured by &s;u&s;pen&s;e: I am in agony till my fate is decided.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXV. Sir George Revel to Lady Loui&s;a G.</HEAD>
<P>PROVIDENCE having &s;o directed it, that I &s;hould owe the little hopes I have of life to the humanity of the per&s;on whom I have mo&s;t cruelly injured, I eagerly embrace the fir&s;t return of my &s;en&s;es to exonerate a guilty con&s;cience, by confe&s;&s;ing to your La|dy&s;hip, that the &s;tories which you have heard reported from the evidence of Lady G.'s &s;er|vant, are fal&s;ehoods, fabricated for the di&s;in|genuous purpo&s;e of detaching your affections from my late antagoni&s;t Mr. Arundel, to who&s;e innocence this acknowledgment is no le&s;s due than to your noble and virtuous parent.</P>
<P>This declaration is entirely voluntary, and I freely made it on the field before we began the duel, which has ju&s;tly proved &s;o fatal to me. Mr. Arundel would then have acquitted me, if I would have con&s;ented to what I am
<PB N="173" REF="174">
now doing; but jealou&s;y and re&s;entment had hardened my heart again&s;t a rival happier and more worthy than my&s;elf, and my pa&s;&s;ion would not &s;uffer me to li&s;ten to the plea of ju&s;tice: pre&s;uming on my &s;kill, I meditated to de&s;troy him, but the hand of Heaven turn|ed my purpo&s;e again&s;t my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I now lie expiring, as I believe, on the bed which your mother's charity affords me, with one wound through my body and two others in my brea&s;t and arm, the agony of which is not half &s;o racking as tho&s;e remor&s;eful horrors that afflict my mind. Tortured in my exit out of this world, and trembling for my entrance into the next, tho&s;e horrors would be in&s;upportable, had not the &s;ame injured excellence, who&s;e hand reaches the cordial to my lips, admini&s;tered the like cordial to my &s;oul, by a&s;&s;uring me of her forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>Le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected by any one that Mr. Arundel had a hand in appointing me to this &s;pot, as knowing it to be the place of Lady G.'s re&s;idence, I do &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you, that he had no voice in the appointment, and that the place of our meeting was pitched upon by my &s;econd Sir John Macarthy More,
<PB N="174" REF="175">
from his knowledge of the &s;pot, and acceded to by the Earl of S. on the behalf of Mr. Arundel, without any privity or &s;ugge&s;tion on his part.</P>
<P>If what &s;eems &s;o impo&s;&s;ible to my expecta|tions, &s;hould neverthele&s;s come to pa&s;s, and by the favor of Heaven I &s;hould in cour&s;e of time recover from this deplorable &s;ituation, it will be long before I &s;hall revi&s;it England. Many years mu&s;t elap&s;e and long ab&s;ence from the &s;cene of my di&s;grace mu&s;t intervene, before the wounds of my mind can be healed after the&s;e in my body have found their cure: bani&s;h from your memory therefore the very name of Revel, and give your father my Lord G. to under&s;tand that the defamer of his wife is too &s;en&s;ible of his own demerit, what|ever he may think of it, ever to a&s;pire to be the hu&s;band of his daughter; and though the ungenerous wound I once gave Arundel is, I tru&s;t, atoned for by the&s;e I have received from him, yet the injury I have attempted to do him in your thoughts, and the ju&s;tice due to a virtuous and elevated character, compel me in con&s;cience to declare, that the man whom I had devoted to death, as being loved by

you, is of all men living the only one who truly merits that mo&s;t happy di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>I dictate this to my friend Sir John Macar|thy More, and &s;ign it with my own hand in pre&s;ence of your noble mother and Mr. L. who is known to you; a very honorable man, to who&s;e &s;kill and humanity I am infinitely indebted: they are privy to the contents, and will witne&s;s the authenticity of them.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXVI. Lady Jane S. to Lady Loui&s;a G.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now give my dear Loui&s;a the conclu&s;ion of my life, character and beha|vior; then recommend my&s;elf to your prayers and prepare for execution.</P>
<P>My brother came down to Arundel-hou&s;e this day before dinner. If I was writing a novel and not a hi&s;tory, I would give you a pathetic de&s;cription of our meeting and em|braces, in which I would float my page with <HI>a flood of tears,</HI> that &s;hould almo&s;t threaten a &s;econd deluge.</P>
<P>Though my lover and I had come to a perfect under&s;tanding with each other, I had re&s;erved my&s;elf for the arrival of my brother, without letting the old Captain into the &s;e|cret; and as for his di&s;covering it by the vir|tue of his own &s;agacity in love affairs, there was not a chance on the tables; I never &s;aw a creature &s;o commodiou&s;ly blind, deaf and incurious in my days.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="178">Some &s;i&s;ters, in my dependant &s;ituation, would have been in a fine puzzle how to break a matter of this &s;ort to &s;ome brothers, on whom their dependance re&s;ted; but I had no &s;uch difficulties to encounter with mine, and if I had, &s;till I &s;hould have taken no other method than I did, which was naturally to tell him in a very few words that Mortlake and I had agreed upon a marriage.</P>
<P>Very well, &s;aid my brother, you have done right to plea&s;e your&s;elf; and upon my &s;oul, Jane, I give you credit for a good eye; for I don't know a finer young fellow in all Eng|land.</P>
<P>Pooh! replied I, don't be ridiculous; do you think I chu&s;e by the eye?&mdash;No, no, re|turned he, Mortlake is a very hone&s;t, worthy lad withal, and one I &s;hall be proud to call my brother-in-law. May I die, if I think you could have cho&s;en better in the three king|doms; &s;o there's an end of that; the next thing is to &s;et you up in the world with &s;ome|thing to live comfortably upon, and we mu&s;t go to the Spani&s;h dollars for that; the Dons, many thanks to 'em, have provided you with a dower.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="179">Hold there, my dear generous brother, I replied, you and I &s;hall not agree upon that bargain; I mu&s;t not forget, if you do, that the Earl of S. will require more to maintain him than the par&s;on's wife, and &s;uch I intend to be to all intents and purpo&s;es.&mdash;But the brats, &s;aid he, mu&s;t have &s;omething to main|tain them, and there'll be no &s;carcity of them, Jane; I can't carry them all out to &s;ea with me.&mdash;Well, replied I, the girls cannot be poorer than their mother was, and if the boys are but as brave as their uncle, they'll fight through the world I warrant 'em.&mdash;Aye, and conquer it too I hope, he cried, before they have done with it: but all this is nothing to the purpo&s;e; I &s;hall &s;ay no more to you upon this &s;ubject; brother Mortlake and I will &s;et|tle that affair between our&s;elves. You have nothing to do but marry as fa&s;t as you can, for Captain Arundel and I &s;hall be bru&s;hing out again very &s;peedily, and I would fain &s;ee my dear &s;i&s;ter &s;afe moored before I loo&s;e the fore&s;ail.&mdash;So &s;aying, the noble youth tenderly embraced me, when before my heart could give a vent to the grateful &s;en&s;ations with which it glowed, the call of the old Captain
<PB N="179" REF="180">
broke up our conference, and &s;ummoned us to the dinner-room.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o pointedly engaging in the manner with which my brother took Mortlake by the hand, when he joined the company, that it told more to my feelings than a volume of fine &s;peeches could have ex|pre&s;&s;ed: I remarked the effect it had upon Mortlake, and I am &s;ure his feelings &s;ympa|thized with mine; joy gli&s;tened in his eyes; all pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence, but where's the poet that can find words for what that &s;ilence ut|tered? Oh! how I dete&s;t a chattering fine-&s;poken &s;entamentali&s;t: give me the mute elo|quence of the heart; that only is the genuine language of love and benevolence.</P>
<P>After dinner Lady Treville, knowing that all things were well under&s;tood between my brother and me from a hint I had given her, and loving at her heart, as you well know, a little good-natured mi&s;chief, began to que&s;|tion Mortlake how his preparations went on at the par&s;onage, ob&s;erving that it was much too good a hou&s;e for a &s;ingle man, and that it would now behove him to look out for a wife.&mdash;This was hint enough for my brother,
<PB N="180" REF="181">
who immediately clo&s;ed in with it by &s;aying he would an&s;wer for Mortlake that he would take a wife of his recommending; upon which the old Captain loudly declared that he would venture a wager he named the lady, for that it could be none other than the gunner's daughter, which it &s;eems is a cant phra&s;e for a dozen la&s;hes at the gun.</P>
<P>It is what I &s;hould have well de&s;erved for my pre&s;umption, &s;aid this amiable young man, (his face covered with blu&s;hes) if ambition had any &s;hare in my affections, or if I could have been daring enough to have grounded a hope upon that charming conde&s;cen&s;ion, which though I could not chu&s;e but admire, I was not &s;o bold as to approach.&mdash;What is the man talking about? cried the rough old &s;eaman, I can't make out a word that he is &s;aying.&mdash;I don't know how you &s;hould, &s;aid Lady Treville, for he is talking about love.&mdash;No, no, an&s;wered he, that hook won't hold, my Lady; I know too much of love to believe that; love is a damn'd noi&s;y, quarrel&s;ome companion; the Doctor there is as meek as Mo&s;es; love is all talk and blu&s;ter, &s;torm and tempe&s;t; I have been in love my&s;elf, and it
<PB N="181" REF="182">
always &s;ets me a &s;wearing, becau&s;e, do you &s;ee, it throws me out of my cour&s;e and puts me upon t'other tack; now Mortlake keeps on his way fair and ea&s;y; nobody &s;hall make me believe he is in love.&mdash;Perhaps &s;ome of the company may be of a different opinion, re|plied &s;he; for in&s;tance there is Lady Jane; I'll refer the ca&s;e to her.&mdash;With all my heart, cried the captain, Lady Jane knows bet|ter things; I'll be judged by Lady Jane.&mdash;Agreed, an&s;wered the good lady, who &s;o fit to decide upon Mortlake's pa&s;&s;ion, as &s;he who in&s;pires it?&mdash;Come, my dear Jane, added my brother, give &s;entence upon your friend.&mdash;My &s;entence, I replied, will be pa&s;&s;ed upon my&s;elf, for if he does not love, I am of all women mo&s;t mi&s;erable.&mdash;Mortlake was &s;itting next to me; he &s;prung from his chair, &s;eized my hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it to his lips with an animation that even &s;tartled me&mdash;Then I take Heaven to witne&s;s, he cried, that my &s;oul doats upon you; my heart beats with love that cannot be uttered; I do but live whil&s;t you approve of me, and every moment of my life &s;hall be de|voted to gratitude and love for the un&s;peak|able ble&s;&s;ing you have be&s;towed upon me.&mdash;
<PB N="182" REF="183">
That's right, cried the hearty old Commander, the man's as mad as a March-hare, I give it up, I give it up; I don't &s;ay but what he is in love now, but I will &s;tand to what I did &s;ay, that he was not in love before. Egad! Mort|lake, thou art an hone&s;t fellow, a lad after my own heart; if you could be in love with that charming creature and in your &s;en&s;es at the &s;ame time, I would not own you for a man: I told you all I knew what love was, and here's my lady would have per&s;uaded me out of my &s;en&s;es: by the Lord Harry but I'll make the dollars jump for this! My dear, dear boy, he cried, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to my brother, I hope all this is to your good liking.&mdash;To my very heart's content, replied my be|loved brother.&mdash;Then about &s;he goes! roared out the old blade, a health to the happy cou|ple! Harkye, Mortlake, do it ju&s;tice, and I will &s;tock your cellars for your life to come. Damn it, Archey! you and I took the Dons in the nick of time; aye, boy, and we'll have another bru&s;h among&s;t them; thank God, we need not go far to find an enemy. Come, wheel it about! (taking a full gla&s;s in his hand) my dear, dear Lady Jane, you mu&s;t let

me love you like a child of my own, like my own dear Archibald, like my own boy Frank, (why the plague is not he here at this mo|ment?)

<P>This is but coar&s;e &s;tuff, you will &s;ay, but it is hone&s;t, and has &s;erved to hurry me out of all my embarra&s;&s;ments, and now I have no|thing to encounter but the eyes of Arundel&mdash;Oh &s;end him to us, with the fires of love and joy &s;parkling in their brighte&s;t lu&s;tre! but if you would compleat the wi&s;h, come with him your&s;elf, then where in all the world &s;hall there be found a circle of &s;uch happine&s;s as our's?</P>
<P>The grotto awaits you: Mortlake and I do not fail to vi&s;it it, and this evening I rambled thither by my&s;elf; I had not long repo&s;ed my&s;elf in this enchanted &s;pot, before the &s;elf|&s;ame &s;ybil, who acco&s;ted me under the tree of

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXVII. Charles Mortlake to Arundel.</HEAD>
<P>THAT partiality, which you pronounced upon in its infancy, has exceeded your warme&s;t predictions: Lady Jane has verified the character you gave her, and tho&s;e atten|tions, which I thought could only be the effect of a little female vanity, I now perceive &s;prung &s;incerely from the heart. Could I &s;uppo&s;e that &s;o much beauty, youth and vivacity, &s;uch high preten&s;ions as &s;he derives from rank, fa|mily and condition, could ever conde&s;cend to the humble lot in which I am placed, and bid

adieu to all the plea&s;ures, all the pride of life? I mu&s;t have had an unrea&s;onable &s;hare of pre|&s;umption to have thought of her any other|wi&s;e than I did: but after you and her brother had left us I confe&s;s to you there were open|ings enough in her behaviour to have in&s;pired a man of le&s;s diffidence than my&s;elf with very flattering hopes. Our walks were longer and more frequent, &s;he was indu&s;trious to find out the mo&s;t &s;olitary places, and our conver&s;ations became more &s;erious and particular: for a time indeed our mutual anxiety in your ab|&s;ence allowed of no reflections but upon the dreadful errand you were engaged in; we did little el&s;e but mingle &s;ighs and &s;orrows, and neither party was qualified to act the comforter to the other: as &s;oon as the joyful tidings of your &s;afety arrived, though qualified with &s;ome little terrors for her beloved brother, our &s;pi|rits revived, and as this was followed by further accounts, which &s;et her mind at ea&s;e about Lord S. our happine&s;s was without alloy.</P>
<P>Anxious as I was to know my fate, I am &s;atisfied I &s;hould never have found re&s;olution to declare my&s;elf, had not her encouragement, con&s;piring with a mo&s;t tempting opportunity,

in a manner extorted it from me. It was then very awkwardly brought out with &s;o much trepidation and terror, that it is my wonder how &s;he could under&s;tand me; but her gene|rous heart di&s;dained to make &s;port of my weakne&s;s, and &s;he had too much pity for my painful &s;truggles to indulge her&s;elf in prolong|ing them: in &s;hort, my dear Arundel, I am confounded by my own good fortune, and &s;carce believe the ble&s;&s;ing I am po&s;&s;e&s;t of: the gallant Earl of S. has ratified his &s;i&s;ter's hum|ble choice with a liberality, which we found it difficult to reduce within the bounds of mo|deration; Lady Jane is &s;urely the mo&s;t di&s;in|tere&s;ted as well as the mo&s;t amiable of Hea|ven's creatures; &s;he &s;ays my income is affluence &s;he has never been accu&s;tomed to; &s;he has laid down a plan for our dome&s;tic oeconomy with the greate&s;t preci&s;ion, and formed her little e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ervants upon the &s;cale of our moderate circum&s;tances with every attention to our future comfort and content.

Is there no hope of her complying with the wi&s;hes of Lady Jane? Alas! I fear it is in vain to think of it.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXVIII. Arundel to Charles Mortlake.</HEAD>
<P>SOON after I had di&s;patched my la&s;t letter, which left me in the utmo&s;t anxiety of mind, I was &s;urpri&s;ed with a vi&s;it from Lord G. I was alone and had fallen into &s;uch a gloomy train of thoughts, that I could not meet the &s;ight of him without the greate&s;t tre|pidation, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as I was with the idea that he was come to pronounce &s;entence upon my hopes; but when he drew forth a letter from his pocket, and told me he was commi&s;&s;ioned by Lady Loui&s;a to pre&s;ent it to me, methought I &s;hould have fainted at the in&s;tant; it &s;eemed as if the &s;mile with which he delivered it was put on by malice to give a keener in&s;ult to my feelings, and holding it unopened in my trem|bling hand&mdash;My Lord, &s;aid I, if this letter, which you have given me, contains the fatal &s;entence, which mu&s;t extingui&s;h the faint hope that hardly glimmers in my brea&s;t, I do be|&s;eech
<PB N="190" REF="191">
you let me hear it from your lips, and &s;pare me the agony of a peru&s;al, which will throw me into &s;uch a &s;ituation, as the bittere&s;t enemy could not contemplate without pain and pity: if my offences again&s;t you and my pre&s;umption in a&s;piring to Lady Loui&s;a's fa|vor, de&s;erve the puni&s;hment of a contemptu|ous refu&s;al, for the honor of humanity do not aggravate that puni&s;hment by taking on your|&s;elf the office of a tormentor, and fea&s;ting your eyes with the agonies you inflict.&mdash;Upon my word, Mr. Arundel, replied he, I am not privy to the contents of that letter; I have &s;imply the honor of being her Lady&s;hip's me&s;&s;enger; but I am free to confe&s;s to you that it is an honor I &s;hould have declined, if I could have &s;uppo&s;ed my&s;elf the bearer of any unwelcome news to you, for I come hither with a heart very thoroughly di&s;po&s;ed to make peace, and if you will break the &s;eal of my commi&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall be very much mi&s;taken if it does not tally with my wi&s;hes.&mdash;I opened the letter, and immediately ca&s;t my eye upon the&s;e tran&s;|porting words&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Welcome, my beloved Arundel! I wel|come you with a tran&s;port of joy which I

am privileged to expre&s;s to you. My fa|ther, who is your convert, will be the bearer of this; you triumph every way, and my fond heart is the ea&s;ie&s;t of your conque&s;ts; de&s;pi&s;e it not however, but come to me without delay; I die to &s;ee you; Heaven be prai&s;ed for its protection of my Arundel!

</LETTER>
<P>My tran&s;port overpowered me; I could not &s;peak; I could not re&s;train my tears; I threw my&s;elf at the feet of Lord G. He rai&s;ed me in his arms and tenderly embraced me&mdash;Thus let us &s;eal our peace for ever, he cried; hence|forth let us be &s;on and father! Loui&s;a is your own.&mdash;He would &s;carce &s;uffer me to make him any reply, much le&s;s to endeavor at ex|pre&s;&s;ing all my &s;en&s;ibility on this tran&s;porting occa&s;ion: I dare &s;ay, he cried, Loui&s;a's letter is a very eager &s;ummons, and you are no le&s;s eager to obey it; and yet I am di&s;po&s;ed to tre&s;|pa&s;s on your attention for a very few minutes, whil&s;t I account to you for the &s;udden revolu|tion which you di&s;cover in my mind towards
<PB N="192" REF="193">
you; and for this you are in the fir&s;t place in|debted to Loui&s;a's honorable &s;incerity, in con|fe&s;&s;ing to me that &s;he had gone the length of offering you a clande&s;tine marriage; I own to you this was a &s;tep, which I never apprehended &s;he would take, having pa&s;&s;ed her word to me again&s;t it, but when no other means appeared to her of preventing your duel with Sir George Revel, in the extremity of her di&s;tre&s;s no won|der if duty, and even honor it&s;elf, could not hold out again&s;t a &s;uperior pa&s;&s;ion, and if any means appeared lawful to pre&s;erve a life &s;o dear and &s;o invaluable to her: I therefore ac|quit her, but at the &s;ame time I very highly re&s;pect you for the noble manner in which you declined her propo&s;al; but when I further under&s;tood that Sir George Revel had revoked his charge, of which I was fir&s;t informed by Lord S. and read the letter you brought to Loui&s;a, which by &s;o full a confe&s;&s;ion on his part entirely does away every &s;hadow of &s;u&s;|picion that could remain in my mind, with what ju&s;tice could I any longer hold out again&s;t you, or pretend to exerci&s;e that right in Loui&s;a to your disfavor, which I owed &s;ingly to your honor and forbearance? No, Mr. Arundel,
<PB N="193" REF="194">
even though you had been without excu&s;e for your public oppo&s;ition to me, which to my &s;hame I mu&s;t own is not the ca&s;e, yet under &s;uch circum&s;tances, injured as you had been by the fal&s;e&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t accu&s;ations, a&s;&s;aulted both in life and reputation by an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in whom I blu&s;h to think was fo&s;tered and adopted by me, unexceptionable in your family, fortune and character, ma&s;ter of the affections of my daughter in the mo&s;t honorable manner, and backed with the mo&s;t zealous approbation of her mother, what &s;ort of man, or rather mon|&s;ter, mu&s;t I have been to have oppo&s;ed my&s;elf to &s;uch preten&s;ions? You have therefore free and unre&s;erved acce&s;s to my Loui&s;a; write to her, vi&s;it her, pur&s;ue the dictates of your af|fection; I cannot doubt your honor, my con|fidence in you is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon proof, and, as you are in ab&s;olute po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the daugh|ter's heart, I tru&s;t you will not refu&s;e to be received into the father's.</P>
<P>No, my Lord, I replied, it is a tender which I accept with gratitude and will endeavor to de&s;erve, but I am &s;o confounded with my good fortune, that I am in the &s;tate of a man, who is ha&s;tily awakened from a dream, the impre&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="194" REF="195">
of which he cannot &s;peedily &s;hake off, nor recover &s;en&s;es enough to di&s;cern the objects that &s;urround him; I &s;carce believe my hap|pine&s;s to be real.</P>
<P>Tru&s;t me, Arundel, he replied, you will find no friend &s;o zealous as a converted ene|my; and now he began to make enquiries about my &s;tay in town, and whether I would accom|pany Lady Loui&s;a and him to Spring Grove. To this I an&s;wered, that I mu&s;t go down to Arundel Hou&s;e, to take leave of my uncle John and Lord S. who would &s;oon be ordered out to &s;ea, and who were there waiting with Lady Jane S. and old Lady Treville, in hour|ly expectation of my return.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip admitted the &s;ufficiency of my plea, and with a kind of &s;lyne&s;s in his manner, a&s;ked what was to become of Lady Jane when her brother went to &s;ea: I &s;miled at this and &s;aid, I doubted if I was at liberty to an&s;wer his que&s;tion. Come, come, &s;aid he, your &s;ecret is not worth keeping; &s;he is going to be married out of hand to your friend Mortlake; you think your&s;elf mighty cunning, but for once I am beforehand with you.&mdash;Then &s;aid I, Lady Loui&s;a is a tell-tale;
<PB N="195" REF="196">
I have ju&s;t received a letter from Mortlake, and &s;he, I &s;uppo&s;e, has had one from the bride-elect.&mdash;She has &s;o, replied he, and a &s;trong de|mand upon her at the &s;ame time, on the &s;core of an old promi&s;e, to be pre&s;ent at her wedding; but how is this to be performed? A country par&s;onage is &s;eldom very capacious, though I am told you have made this quite elegant; and as for Arundel Hou&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e you would not admit Loui&s;a and me into that for the world.&mdash;My Lord, an&s;wered I, you are de|termined to overpower me with your kindne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion.&mdash;I would willingly try if you will have better luck in your own hou&s;e, Arundel, than you have had in mine: hither|to I think you are indebted to me for no|thing but a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, duels, and calumnious charges: let us &s;ee if we cannot repair the&s;e mi&s;carriages by a peaceful meeting, and a plea&s;ant party at Arundel Hou&s;e: make me known to your gallant uncle; let me be ac|quainted with this lucky friend of your's, who is carrying off one of the fine&s;t and livelie&s;t young women of the age in the face of all the fine men of rank, fortune, and fa&s;hion, who
<PB N="196" REF="197">
would never think of taking orders to make their way with a hand&s;ome girl of high di&s;|tinction. Who in the name of wonder would &s;uppo&s;e the church to be the road to preferr|ment of that &s;ort?</P>
<P>I cannot wonder at your Lord&s;hip's que&s;|tion, as you are not acquainted with the per&s;on and qualities of my friend Mortlake, and per|haps take mea&s;ure of Lady Jane by the gene|ral &s;tandard of her contemporaries: but if you will fulfil the hopes you have given me, by honoring me with your company at Arundel Hou&s;e, I do not doubt but a very &s;hort ac|quaintance with the object of her Lady&s;hip's choice will convince you of the &s;uperior good &s;en&s;e &s;he has &s;hewn in making it.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays he, let us go and try our joint intere&s;t with Loui&s;a, to per&s;uade her to this journey; if &s;he acquits her&s;elf well as bride|maid, it will be a good kind of rehear&s;al be|fore &s;he performs as principal; but remember I condition for the violin; give me mu&s;ic and I will not interrupt your love; feed my ears well and I &s;hall not quarrel with you for the re&s;t of your entertainment; you are but a young
<PB N="197" REF="198">
hou&s;ekeeper, and I condition again&s;t being f&ecirc;ted; po&s;tpone that till Loui&s;a pre&s;ides at your table, and then we &s;hall know whom to blame, if the e&s;tabli&s;hment is not according to form and order.</P>
<P>Now therefore, Mortlake, announce this to your &s;oul's better part, tell it to the whole worthy circle, let them &s;hare in the felicity of your friend; I &s;hall follow this letter clo&s;e at the heels, yet I write, becau&s;e even moments &s;hould be anticipated, when they are charged with tidings of &s;uch joy. Whi&s;per my good hou&s;ekeeper in the ear, and let her &s;et her brooms and mops in motion; pre&s;s forward the works at your own hou&s;e with vigour, and incen&s;e the chamber that is de&s;tined to re|ceive you to the arms of your beloved.&mdash;Oh Charles, Charles! what will become of you and me! can we outlive our tran&s;ports? We have not lowered our con&s;titutions to that cold blood, which the &s;tale hackneyed &s;en&s;uali&s;ts of this voluptuous town reduce them&s;elves to; we never wa&s;ted nature's genial fount, never un&s;trung her bow, nor to the loathed embrace of harlots pro&s;tituted our manly vigour; even our hearts will offer up their maiden oblations
<PB N="198" REF="199">
to the re&s;pective godde&s;&s;es of their idolatry: we never loved before; hereafter we &s;hall ne|ver cea&s;e to love.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;end down expre&s;s the be&s;t Piano|forte I can purcha&s;e; I am determined al&s;o to hang the late Lady Arundel's dre&s;&s;ing-room and bed-chamber afre&s;h for my divine Loui&s;a to repo&s;e in; for this purpo&s;e I &s;hall di&s;patch a &s;mall &s;quadron of nimble arti&s;ts from hence, who will decorate it in a trice; the bed, to which tho&s;e heavenly, tho&s;e enchanting limbs are to be committed, &s;hall not be quite unwor|thy of the jewel it enca&s;es; I will keep it &s;acred and untouched till &s;he revi&s;its again; I will kneel to it, as before a con&s;ecrated altar, and there I will offer up my prayers to Heaven for ble&s;|&s;ings multiplied upon her head.&mdash;Oh, Heaven and Earth! what raptures have I been now receiving! &s;he loves me, Charles, beyond the power of love to &s;peak of. Lord G. (for which kind act may my grateful lips ever ble&s;s and prai&s;e him!) &s;ent me up alone to her chamber; I found her all impatience, ec&s;tacy and love; &s;he &s;prung with open arms to my embrace; pa&s;&s;ion like her's di&s;dains re&s;erve, a &s;oul &s;o noble &s;purns at all the petty forms of
<PB N="199" REF="200">
coy di&s;&s;imulation; words had di&s;graced her feeling, tears were her better eloquence and tran&s;ports my more flattering welcome. How long I held her in my arms, let tho&s;e, who could have numbered moments &s;o employed, declare; I cannot gue&s;s at time, in which my &s;en&s;es were entranced: upon her unre&s;i&s;ting lips I &s;ealed my gratitude, I left my &s;oul.&mdash;At length &s;he murmured out&mdash;Oh, Arundel! no more! &s;upport me to my chair: I bore her in my arms; the nerves of Love are &s;trong <HI>as the Nemaean lion's nerves</HI>; I placed her on the &s;eat, then threw my&s;elf upon my knees, and with my arms around her wai&s;t &s;upported my almo&s;t lifele&s;s charmer, hanging her &s;weet head and drooping like a lily. When her &s;pirits had in &s;ome degree &s;ub&s;ided, and &s;he began to recover, &s;he drew forth a locket richly &s;et, containing her own miniature, to which &s;he had affixed a ribband, and began to fa&s;ten it round my neck; I &s;uffered her to complete her work, then cla&s;ping her hands and pre&s;&s;ing them with the pre&s;ent they con|tained to my grateful lips, &s;mothered them with ki&s;&s;es.&mdash;I now gently &s;olicited to know when I might be ble&s;t with the divine original.
<PB N="200" REF="201">
&mdash;This day, this hour, this in&s;tant, &s;he repli|ed; but now contain your&s;elf; be prudent for my &s;ake; if it be po&s;&s;ible, I love you but too well. Come, talk to me of &s;ome more quiet &s;ubject; but not a word of your affair beyond &s;ea; my heart cannot bear it; tell me about Mortlake and my charming Jane; dear girl, how I adore her! There is a heart, my Arun|del! I am &s;ure the object of her choice de|&s;erves her; I know he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every manly, virtuous, and engaging quality, be|cau&s;e he is your cho&s;en friend; I therefore boldly pronounce him worthy of his happi|ne&s;s; but why do I anticipate a plea&s;ure I am &s;o &s;oon to enjoy? I am coming down to vi&s;it you: &s;hall I be welcome, Arundel? I think you will not turn me from your doors.&mdash;But I might ramble thus for ever, and I have al|ready &s;aid enough to &s;atisfy you of my hap|pine&s;s.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXIX. The Counte&s;s to the Earl of G.</HEAD>
<P>AS the &s;olitude, to which your di&s;carded wife has retreated, is by an extraordinary chance now become known to you, I think that you &s;hould al&s;o know the motives for my coming hither.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t our wi&s;hes for the di&s;po&s;al of our daughter in marriage were &s;o oppo&s;ite to each other, and you &s;u&s;pected me of taking an ac|tive part again&s;t Sir George Revel, there ap|peared to me no &s;tep &s;o likely to remove tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions, as totally to &s;eclude my&s;elf from all communication with my family.</P>
<P>When I thus broke from the deare&s;t tie in nature, and &s;acrificed to your repo&s;e the ten|der affections of a mother, I fondly thought I might e&s;cape your cen&s;ure, though I did not flatter my&s;elf with the hopes of your approba|tion: but I was not &s;uffered to remain in quiet oblivion; even in this &s;olitude I was &s;till to be the mark and butt of malice; a new accu&s;ation
<PB N="202" REF="203">
was &s;tarted again&s;t me by an unhappy man, who has dearly atoned for his inju&s;tice. I took my accu&s;er into my hou&s;e covered with wounds, and at the la&s;t ga&s;p of life: the com|punctions of a guilty con&s;cience, the terrors of impending death, and gratitude for my un|merited attentions, con&s;pired to produce that confe&s;&s;ion, which I hope has reached your hand, and brought &s;uch conviction with it as you can no longer with&s;tand.</P>
<P>I have now a claim upon your ju&s;tice for re&s;toring me to my family, from which you cruelly expelled me, and if this is in your me|ditation to do, I mu&s;t plainly tell you, that &s;o long as you per&s;i&s;t in excluding Mr. Arun|del, you exclude me. If I am innocent, can he be guilty? The &s;ame atonement is due to both, and I reject every offer of reconcile|ment which does not include him. Hu&s;bands have been known to pardon guilty wives, and many have received a penitent offender into their family again, but pardon is not &s;o readily extended to the partner of their guilt, and no man lives who would contaminate his blood by marrying the daughter to the &s;edu|cer of the mother. Let this then be the te&s;t
<PB N="203" REF="204">
of my innocence, and your compleat per&s;ua&s;ion of it: be&s;tow your daughter upon the man &s;he loves; by one generous act you will give happine&s;s to your child, bring a ble&s;&s;ing on your&s;elf, make a friend of him whom you have injuriou&s;ly treated, and heal the wounded heart of a wife, who returns to <HI>you on the&s;e con|ditions, or returns no more.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XC. The Earl to the Counte&s;s of G.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE received your letter, and you are obeyed: Mr. Arundel has this day ob|tained my full con&s;ent and approbation for as &s;peedy a marriage with our daughter as cir|cum&s;tances will admit; his conduct has been, in all re&s;pects, that of a man of perfect honor; and in making this &s;acrifice of my private re|&s;entments, I have done no more than I ought to do upon conviction of my being the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;or, with this aggravation of the affront
<PB N="204" REF="205">
I put upon him, that I then regarded him in the light of a dependant.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf you will not doubt that an acknowledgment like this can only be the re|&s;ult of a &s;trict &s;elf-examination, and to this I am now indebted for a &s;erenity of mind and temper, which I never before experienced.</P>
<P>The &s;avage attack Sir George Revel made upon Mr. Arundel, in con&s;equence of what pa&s;&s;ed at Spring Grove, and the unju&s;t grounds of that bloody rencontre, which took place between them, wherein your reputation was traiterou&s;ly attempted, could not fail to open my eyes to the real character of the man whom I &s;o zealou&s;ly and blindly abetted. The dread|ful cha&s;ti&s;ement his guilt has received from the hand of Arundel, the very extraordinary inci|dent of his being carried at the point of death to your hou&s;e, and the confe&s;&s;ion which the terrors of his &s;ituation in that cri&s;is extorted from his con&s;cience, are all events combined, as it &s;hould &s;eem, by the very hand of Hea|ven, and the reflections they have awakened in my mind have effectually turned it to the truth. I now &s;ee your innocence, I feel your &s;ufferings, and I dete&s;t my&s;elf for the cruel
<PB N="205" REF="206">
wrongs I have done you. As the character of Sir George Revel &s;inks upon the review, that of Arundel ri&s;es in my e&s;teem: Can I then re|fu&s;e my daughter to &s;uch a man, &s;upported too by &s;uch an advocate as your&s;elf, and beloved by Loui&s;a to a degree beyond example? Could I have held out again&s;t her love, again&s;t your &s;olicitation, and again&s;t his merits, I had been indeed obdurate: add to this, that &s;uch is now his e&s;tabli&s;hment in point of fortune, reputa|tion and preten&s;ions of all &s;orts, that I &s;hall be found to have con&s;ulted our daughter's inte|re&s;t in this match not le&s;s than her happine&s;s: his family is of the noble&s;t in the kingdom, and the be&s;t recommendation I can give of my own is, that it has in times pa&s;t branched from the root of the Arundels.</P>
<P>All this while here is the gallant Earl of S. his friend and &s;econd, who in point of pedi|gree would not vail his bonnet to the Bour|bons, &s;ees his &s;i&s;ter Lady Jane be&s;tow her&s;elf upon a country par&s;on, and applauds her choice: young Mortlake, Arundel's intimate, is the happy man; he is &s;ettled in Arundel's own pari&s;h, who has e&s;tabli&s;hed him there in a very good living, and fitted up a par&s;onage-hou&s;e
<PB N="206" REF="207">
for him and Lady Jane, which I hear is one of the mo&s;t elegant things upon a mode|rate &s;cale in all England. This young bride-elect has been &s;ome time with her brother living at Arundel Hou&s;e, and there &s;he com|menced her acquaintance with Mortlake, who has the character of a mo&s;t amiable and ex|cellent young man. Loui&s;a and I are to be pre&s;ent at the wedding, which is to take place in a few days, and we &s;hall be enter|tained in Mr. Arundel's hou&s;e: he is &s;etting out for the country directly, and we &s;hall go down a day or two before the wedding, and immediately after the ceremony &s;et out for Spring Grove, where Arundel has promi&s;ed to accompany us: his uncle John and Lord S. are to &s;et out at the &s;ame time to take com|mand of their &s;hips; and thus we &s;hall leave the bride and bridegroom to them&s;elves, which I think is very well planned for their comfort and repo&s;e.</P>
<P>I need not attempt to tell you how very much our dear ardent girl is in love with this engaging young man; you know her di&s;|po&s;ition well, and can paint it to your&s;elf: much le&s;s can I de&s;cribe to you her agonies,
<PB N="207" REF="208">
whil&s;t he was ab&s;ent upon that dreadful er|rand; Heaven forbid I &s;hould ever behold her &s;uch a &s;pectacle again! nothing you can con|ceive will exceed it. Sure no human crea|ture ever loved as &s;he does. I think two more perfect creatures were never ca&s;t in human mould: I contemplate their forms with wonder and delight, and I declare to you I find a &s;ympathetic kind of likene&s;s in their features, which &s;eems to mark them out as de&s;tined for each other. It was a tran&s;port to behold them kneeling before me, her hand in his, and both their countenances animated with joy and gratitude: I ble&s;&s;ed them in your name as well as my own; I rai&s;ed them and embraced them in my arms; then taking our child by the hand, I de&s;ired Arundel to receive her as a pledge of future friend&s;hip, never to cea&s;e between us. I de&s;cribed her to him as &s;he is, a creature formed in the ex|treme of all that is generous in nature, ardent in affection and benevolent in &s;oul; I be|&s;eeched of him to guard a &s;pirit &s;o open and defencele&s;s from the dangers of a crafty and de&s;igning world; to cheri&s;h her with his love and coun&s;el her with his under&s;tanding. To
<PB N="208" REF="209">
her I &s;aid in few words&mdash;Daughter, I have be&s;towed you upon the man of your heart; remember what is due to his honor, to your own, to mine, to your ab&s;ent mother's.</P>
<P>In this moment I experienced a new de|light, &s;uperior to any I had ever known, the delight of giving happine&s;s to a beloved child. The gratitude of the&s;e young people was a pa&s;&s;ion, that like their love defies de&s;cription. And now have I de&s;erved your pardon? can you withhold from me that pity and forgive|ne&s;s you be&s;towed on Revel? will you not re|turn to me? In the mean time, as you have made Arundel's marriage a previous condi|tion, I &s;hall expedite it without much regard to the tardy proceedings of the law. I may promi&s;e my&s;elf not to be oppo&s;ed by Loui&s;a in this, for I think of all Love's votaries &s;he is the true&s;t.

<HEAD>LETTER XCI. Lady Loui&s;a to the Counte&s;s of G.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Arundel Hou&s;e.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM happy in confirming to my deare&s;t mother the happy tidings which my father &s;ent by the conveyance of Davi&s;on; every thing which has &s;ince occurred convinces me of the entire revolution which his mind has undergone with re&s;pect to you and Mr. Arun|del; at the &s;ame time nothing can exceed his tenderne&s;s and kindne&s;s to me.</P>
<P>We arrived at the place, whence this is dated, ye&s;terday in the forenoon: Mr. Arun|del met us on hor&s;eback about three miles from the hou&s;e, and conducted us through his grounds and a fine avenue cut through a noble wood by a private road. This is really a grand place: the park is bold and romantic, the river quite delightful, and the hou&s;e far beyond what I expected from the owner's ac|count of it. It is old and irregular, but very capacious, and contains &s;ome noble apart|ments,
<PB N="211" REF="212">
which are more &s;triking to me than all our modern elegance. My father is in rap|tures, particularly with a collection of family portraits in the hall and gallery, many of which are by Vandyke and other capital ma&s;|ters, which you know are quite his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nothing ever equalled the re&s;pectful and cordial reception Arundel gave my father; when he met our coach he di&s;mounted from his hor&s;e, came up to the window and wel|comed us with the mo&s;t grateful tran&s;ports: we pre&s;ented him our hands, both which he &s;aluted in the manner &s;o peculiarly his own; my father's with a filial devotion, mine with a lover's ardour.</P>
<P>Upon our entering the hall he embraced my father in pre&s;ence of the company, who had there arranged them&s;elves to receive us: &s;omething he &s;aid, which I lo&s;t in my hurry of &s;pirits, but I heard the words&mdash;You have made this a joyful hou&s;e, my Lord.&mdash;Lady Jane S. Lady Treville, and my ever honored Lord S. met us in the hall: if I &s;ay that I flew into the arms of my beloved Jane, I &s;carce exceed the truth; my father &s;econded me with a gallantry that quite charmed me&mdash;
<PB N="212" REF="213">
I ever admired you, Lady Jane, henceforward I adore you, were the words with which he addre&s;&s;ed her.&mdash;To the gallant Earl I whi&s;|pered in a murmuring voice&mdash;Oh! my Lord S. my heart is too full to thank you: may Heaven reward your generous friend&s;hip!&mdash;All the world mu&s;t love Arundel, he replied; you alone de&s;erve him.&mdash;We were now u&s;her|ed into a &s;tately old room, fitted with Nor|way oak and hung with pictures, where the maje&s;tic figure of the brave John Arundel pre&s;ented it&s;elf to our awe-&s;truck eyes, like one of the colo&s;&s;al heroes of ancient days, or it might be John of Gaunt him&s;elf. As Arun|del was leading me by the hand to pre&s;ent me to him, I prote&s;t my knees knocked together and my heart trembled within me, for his gi|gantic &s;tature and martial air, with a tremen|dous ga&s;h acro&s;s his forehead, which has no hair to &s;helter it, would be too terrible to ap|proach, if Nature had not thrown a gleam of benevolence over his countenance, which &s;eems to &s;ay to the pigmies of creation&mdash;Come near! I will not harm you.&mdash;He took my quivering hands in his, rai&s;ed them to his lips, whil&s;t he &s;tooped to ki&s;s them, and
<PB N="213" REF="214">
whil&s;t the <HI>big tears cour&s;ed one another</HI> down his manly cheek&mdash;God Almighty ble&s;s you, my dear Lady, he exclaimed, you are a lovely creature; by the Lord, nephew Francis, &s;he is as beautiful as an angel!&mdash;Pardon my va|nity, my dear mother, for repeating his words; I give them to you as characteri&s;tic of the man, and tell you things naturally as they pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>One in&s;tance of Arundel's elegant attention to me I mu&s;t not omit: upon entering the apartment appropriated to my u&s;e, I perceived it had been newly furni&s;hed for the occa&s;ion with &s;ilk hangings, di&s;po&s;ed in a mo&s;t brilliant and &s;triking ta&s;te, after a fa&s;hion which was new to me, being drawn up in folds &s;omething like the draperies of a tent; the bed in parti|lar was one of the mo&s;t beautiful things I have ever &s;een. In my anti-room and on my dre&s;&s;ing-table there was every thing for u&s;e and ornament that art and nature could &s;upply, not forgetting a profu&s;ion of the &s;weete&s;t flowers, which he knows I am &s;o fond of: over the chimney he had hung a mo&s;t enchanting Saint Cecilia, divinely con|ceived
<PB N="214" REF="215">
and executed by our Romney; a ma&s;|ter-piece of modern art.</P>
<P>After trifling a little at my looking-gla&s;s, and a few repairs, which a du&s;ty journey had made nece&s;&s;ary, I came down to the com|pany, and in a few minutes after Mortlake entered the room: Jane's lovely face was &s;carlet on the occa&s;ion; Arundel flew to him, as much to relieve his mode&s;t embarra&s;&s;ment as to pre&s;ent him to Lord G. and me, which he did with that graceful &s;weetne&s;s in&s;eparable from his minute&s;t actions, but on this occa&s;ion it was peculiarly con&s;picuous; not a word was uttered by him or me, when we were pre&s;ented to each other, but the fir&s;t view I caught of his face opened all the character of his mind: it is a countenance of the mo&s;t touching ca&s;t; it cannot be called an unempa&s;|&s;ioned humility that prevails in it, and yet there is &s;uch a &s;weet and almo&s;t feminine &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in his eyes, that you would think no injuries could rou&s;e him; it is in truth the emanation of an angel's mind, and when he &s;miles it is benevolence it&s;elf; his mouth and teeth are exqui&s;ite, I cannot prai&s;e them more than by
<PB N="215" REF="216">
telling you they are a counterpart of Arun|del's; his voice &s;oft, tender, and melodious, and an expre&s;&s;ion in his features as various and changeable as can well be imagined. In &s;hort, I give Jane all the credit in the world, for he is elegantly and indeed very finely formed in his per&s;on, of a manly make and becoming &s;tature; and when his eyes glanced upon her I was well convinced they were no idle engines in the hands of Love.</P>
<P>That gay &s;oul old Lady Treville did the honors of the table at dinner, which was admirably well &s;erved and attended: I never &s;aw my father in &s;uch &s;pirits; he was in rap|tures with the old Captain, whom for the fu|ture we are to call by a higher title, for after the cloth was removed, and a health or two was gone round, Arundel pre&s;ented him with a paper, which announced his promo|tion to a Rear admiral's flag, and at the &s;ame time appointed him to take command of a &s;quadron fitting for immediate &s;ervice, in which the Earl of S. is to have a line-of-battle &s;hip under his old commander. The old lady at the head of the table, with the gallantry of a Frenchwoman, threw her glove
<PB N="216" REF="217">
to the Admiral, and bid him tackle that to his flag, and beware how he parted with the favors of a lady. It was a fair challenge, and the veteran did not flinch it, for he &s;tart|ed from his &s;eat, marched to the head of the table, &s;aluted the old lady and the younger ones in turn, then &s;at down in great &s;tate, and with a loud voice jovially cried out&mdash;Now let the enemies of Great Britain keep their di&s;|tance, for by the Lord I am invincible;&mdash;then turning to Lord S. exclaimed&mdash;What &s;ay you, my brave Archibald? which was accompa|nied with a hearty &s;hake of the hand, and other &s;ea ceremonies and endearments, which I cannot explain. In &s;hort he is the life and &s;oul of our circle, but it requires a proper &s;hare of nerves to reli&s;h his conver&s;ation, for he talks as loud as if he was in a &s;torm, and his laugh is a perfect feu-de-joie; he has a thou&s;and &s;ea-tricks which he practi&s;es upon Lord S. and a &s;et of jokes ready made for the occa&s;ion that I dare &s;ay have a great deal of humour in their own language, but to me were perfectly unintelligible. Arundel ma|nages him with great addre&s;s, but Lord G. is &s;o devoted to him, that he only &s;tudies how to
<PB N="217" REF="218">
plea&s;e him and indulge his humour. He doats upon Jane and calls her daughter, and in truth has proved him&s;elf a father to her noble brother: his genero&s;ity to the betrothed couple has already &s;hewn it&s;elf in a great cargo of wines and various articles of hou&s;e-keeping, which has made its appearance at the par&s;onage.</P>
<P>The afternoon being delicious, we made a little excur&s;ion on the Medway in a four-oared wherry, rowed by the Admiral's and Lord S.'s &s;ervants, who are of the amphibious &s;ort, and as it &s;hould &s;eem part of their crew. The Admiral took the helm and kept roaring to them all the way from behind us, not without a due proportion of &s;uch phra&s;es as had novelty at lea&s;t to recommend them. We cut through the water at a prodigious rate, and as we pa&s;&s;ed under Mortlake's ter|race it was with joy I &s;urveyed the charming &s;pot, where my fair friend is de&s;tined to re&s;ide with one of the mo&s;t amiable of men. We did not land, but returned the more expedi|tiou&s;ly, as Arundel was impatient to give my father his promi&s;ed treat of a little mu&s;ic. To-morrow morning we intend to devote to a
<PB N="218" REF="219">
more particular view of that delicious &s;pot, which Arundel has embelli&s;hed with &s;o much fondne&s;s and with &s;uch elegance of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Upon our return to the hou&s;e we found a room prepared for our mu&s;ic, with an ad|mirable piano-forte, new for the occa&s;ion, and put in excellent tune and order by a man &s;ent down from the maker for the purpo&s;e: an elegant &s;ervice of ices and other refre&s;hments was &s;et out. The room, the in&s;trument, Arundel's delightful accompaniment, the joy of heart I then felt, the &s;ight of faces &s;o dear to me, their flattering applau&s;es and my un|common flow of health and &s;pirits, all con&s;pired to call out my &s;mall powers to their be&s;t advan|tage: Arundel was Orpheus him&s;elf, his very eyes were melodious, nothing but harmony was to be di&s;covered in his countenance. We took care to &s;elect my father's favorites, and we had the &s;atisfaction to give him plea&s;ure and content by every thing we undertook.</P>
<P>When we retired to our apartments for the night, Arundel took the candles from the &s;er|vant, who was waiting in the hall to light me to my chamber, and a&s;ked me if he might not be honored by that office. My father &s;eeing
<PB N="219" REF="220">
this, cried out&mdash;By all means, by all means, my girl, keep him to his duty. Whereupon I permitted it, and he walked before me into my dre&s;&s;ing-room, from which my &s;ervant in|&s;tantly retired, and I found my&s;elf alone with him.&mdash;I cannot behave &s;o ill to you in your own hou&s;e, I &s;aid, as not to a&s;k you to &s;it down.&mdash;He immediately threw him&s;elf at my feet&mdash;In what words &s;hall I thank you, my &s;oul's idol, for this happy day? Was ever man &s;o honored or &s;o ble&s;t? Oh! my Loui&s;a, how &s;hall I de&s;erve this goodne&s;s? My heart over|flows with love and gratitude.&mdash;I tenderly be|&s;eeched him to ari&s;e; I rai&s;ed him from the ground&mdash;Arundel, I replied, my heart is &s;o entirely your's, you po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o wholly every thought, every movement in my mind, and my confidence in you is &s;o unbounded, that I keep no re&s;erve before you: know then there does not live a creature &s;o devoted as I am to my Arundel; for you alone I live; your's only I am and ever will be; you are the unrivalled ma&s;ter of my affections.</P>
<P>Ah, my beloved mother, do you tremble for your fond empa&s;&s;ioned daughter? Trem|ble not, I be&s;eech you; his delicacy did not
<PB N="220" REF="221">
permit him to &s;tay another minute: May all good angels watch over you, he cried! may your dreams be happy! Farewell! I mu&s;t attend upon your father.</P>
<P>I have now given you a circum&s;tantial jour|nal of our fir&s;t day. The next morning when we met at breakfa&s;t Mortlake attended to con|duct us to the par&s;onage; the weather was divinely fine, and Arundel and I had had a little walk in the garden, where we had amu&s;ed our&s;elves with projecting alterations and improvements: the carriages attended at the door to convey us to the river-&s;ide, and we ferried over the &s;tream to a landing-place at the foot of Mortlake's terrace, which brought us by a regular a&s;cent up a very beautiful &s;awn to the hou&s;e, which we entered by a gla&s;s door, that opens into a library, elegantly fitted and compleatly furni&s;hed with books, which I under&s;tand is a very fine collection: this is ab&s;olutely a mo&s;t enchanting room, and not the le&s;s &s;o in my eyes for containing a half-length portrait of Arundel over the chimney, admi|rably painted by Gain&s;borough. There are upon the &s;ame floor an eating-parlour, draw|ing-room, and a little dre&s;&s;ing-room for the
<PB N="221" REF="222">
ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e; above &s;tairs are four bed-chambers and two dre&s;&s;ing-rooms; Jane's apartment, which &s;he is to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of to-morrow (this being the eve of her wedding-day) is furni&s;hed with great ta&s;te and &s;impli|city; her dre&s;&s;ing-table di&s;played &s;ome elegant tokens of her brother's liberality, and my fa|ther having very kindly de&s;ired I would pro|vide my&s;elf with &s;ome wedding token for my friend, and given me a very hand&s;ome &s;um for the purpo&s;e, I left upon the table an en|amelled watch, with chain and trinkers, of the be&s;t pattern and workman&s;hip I could pur|cha&s;e in London, which the dear girl flattered me by accepting in the mo&s;t gracious manner: Mortlake &s;eemed extremely plea&s;ed with it, and my Arundel above mea&s;ure. This happy couple are compleatly e&s;tabli&s;hed by the libe|rality of their friends; they have a &s;mall but &s;eemingly well-cho&s;en family of hou&s;e-&s;ervants, and are &s;tocked with every thing without doors as well as within, which can be nece&s;&s;ary for their comfort; every thing in and about the hou&s;e was fini&s;hed at Arundel's expence; their plate, linen and equipage were given them by Lord S. and the Admiral has &s;tored their cel|lars;
<PB N="222" REF="223">
they have a very neat and mode&s;t po&s;t-chai&s;e with a pair of hor&s;es, and Jane, who is an admirable rider, has a favorite mare for the &s;ide-&s;addle, which her beloved purcha&s;ed in the neighbourhood. All the&s;e things we &s;aw, not omitting the minute&s;t article; judge with what tran&s;port I &s;urveyed this prelude to their happine&s;s, but you can have no idea of the effect it had upon my father. Oh! my dear Madam, he is a new man, and he &s;eems as if he was tran&s;planted into a new world.&mdash;Where have I been, he cries, all this while, and what have I been doing? This is happine&s;s; this is the true ambition; what a phantom have I been following!&mdash;He ob&s;erved to me in a whi&s;per, that this was the very hou&s;e in the world to charm you above all the palaces of the great. Oh that &s;he was here pre&s;ent! added he, and then he declared to me, that as &s;oon as he was ble&s;&s;ed with your &s;ociety again, he would retire to the country, new model his family by reducing the &s;cale, and di&s;po&s;e of his hou&s;e in town, and, if you approved of it, of his villa al&s;o: he is charmed with Mort|lake, and applauds Lady Jane to the &s;kies. As we were walking down the garden towards
<PB N="223" REF="224">
the river, on our return, he drew me a&s;ide to expre&s;s how delighted he was with the &s;cene of happine&s;s he had been &s;urveying, and what joy it gave him to reflect that I &s;hould have &s;uch an amiable couple for my near neighbours and in&s;eparable friends; he then a&s;ked me if I ap|proved of his reque&s;ting Mortlake to come to Spring Grove to perform a ceremony for me and Arundel, which he hoped would take place in a few days. I &s;aid that I &s;uppo&s;ed Arundel would &s;ettle that with his friend.&mdash;No, no, he replied, you may depend upon it he will not entrench upon the lady's prerogative in that particular, but there can be no doubt of its being a mo&s;t acceptable choice to him, and therefore with your leave I will make the reque&s;t both to Mortlake and Lady Jane, the fir&s;t opportunity I have of &s;peaking to them a|part; I hope they will not much regret the trou|ble of a &s;hort journey upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion: but upon &s;econd thoughts, added he, perhaps it is a compliment that in the fir&s;t place &s;hould be offered to Sir Jo&s;eph Arundel, though I &s;u&s;pect there is not the greate&s;t harmony in that quarter; however I will con&s;ult with Arundel before I take any &s;tep in the matter:
<PB N="224" REF="225">
indeed if my old tutor the Dean had been now living, I know not how I could have pa&s;&s;ed him over, but his death leaves me free from any other obligations, and by the way, Loui&s;a, I have now a donative to di&s;po&s;e of, which his decea&s;e has vacated, that would exactly fit this amiable young man, and being one of tho&s;e douceurs in the church, which are not attended with the cure of &s;ouls, it can in no ca&s;e detach him from his re&s;idence here. What &s;ay you to this, my dear? you have all been making wedding pre&s;ents, may I not throw in mine among&s;t the re&s;t? Had I been in office I mu&s;t have attended to the demands of intere&s;t, now it is in my power to indulge the impul&s;e of friend&s;hip.&mdash;Is not this a mo&s;t plea&s;ing in&s;tance of a mind awakened to its genuine &s;en&s;ibility? Can I give you a better proof of a temper happily reformed? Oh! my beloved mother, Providence will repay your &s;ufferings; there is happine&s;s yet in &s;tore for you; the hour, I hope, is approaching fa&s;t, when I &s;hall pre&s;s you to my grateful heart and feel the pre&s;&s;ure of your fond protecting arms: with what ten|derne&s;s did my Arundel talk of you this morning, as we conver&s;ed together in our
<PB N="225" REF="226">
walk before breakfa&s;t! It is not in my power to convey to you the one half of what he &s;aid with any ju&s;tice to his &s;entiments, and if I could repeat his words, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to repeat his manner, which is &s;o peculiarly his own. I mu&s;t not however omit to tell you, that among&s;t other kindne&s;&s;es he offered to bring me to you as &s;oon as we were married for the purpo&s;e of e&s;corting you home, and I &s;hould add that my father has &s;ignified his in|tention of coming to you in per&s;on, as &s;oon as that event has taken place: tell me, therefore, if it will be agreeable to you that Arundel and I &s;hould accompany him on the journey; be a&s;&s;ured it will afford us unfeigned plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now bring my journal to a conclu|&s;ion, becau&s;e I make a point of dating from this place, and our departure is fixt for to|morrow immediately after the wedding, that we may reach Spring Grove before night. Arundel goes with us, and my father brought his coach that we might have his company by the way: when our ceremony has taken place we &s;hall &s;et off for Arundel Hou&s;e.&mdash;Oh Hea|vens! my dear mother, my heart palpitates with alarms, which I cannot de&s;cribe; yet Arundel is tender, there is mercy in his eyes;
<PB N="226" REF="227">
I love, I doat upon him to di&s;traction; why &s;hould I dread what I &s;o much de&s;ire? why am I in the&s;e terrors?</P>
<P>You know my friend Jane, among&s;t a thou|&s;and other <HI>agremens,</HI> has a talent for poetry; you have &s;een &s;ome &s;pecimens of her ver&s;es: when I was in Mortlake's library this morning, as my father was expatiating upon the charms of retirement and tranquillity in &s;uch a de|lightful &s;pot, Mortlake &s;ecretly put into my hand a copy of the following little poem ad|dre&s;&s;ed to Solitude, which with great difficulty he had per&s;uaded Jane to let him tran&s;cribe.&mdash;I give the&s;e lines to your Lady&s;hip, &s;aid he, a&s;&s;ured that you will prize them for the &s;ake of the beloved author.&mdash;I &s;end them to you, my dear mother, as I think the general &s;enti|ment is of that moral and contemplative ca&s;t, that will harmonize with your feelings in your pre&s;ent &s;olitude.</P>

<P>I HEAR, with equal &s;hame and horror, that you, my &s;on (alas! that I mu&s;t call you &s;uch) have killed a noble gentleman, Sir George Revel, in a duel; your going into a foreign country to evade the laws, which ob|tain in your own, mark the deliberation of the act, and &s;how how unworthy you are to be a member of that legi&s;lative body, who &s;hould jointly and &s;everally protect the peace and or|der of the &s;tate, from which you have made your&s;elf a voluntary outlaw.</P>
<P>I hear withal that your quarrel with the decea&s;ed, who&s;e blood is upon your con&s;cience, aro&s;e from a vain competition you entered into with him for the favor of a certain noble heire&s;s: great indeed mu&s;t have been your pre&s;umption, and only to be equalled by your ab&s;urdity (give me leave to &s;ay) when you could a&s;pire to the daughter of the Earl of G.
<PB N="230" REF="231">
whom you repaid for patronizing you in po|verty by a mo&s;t virulent oppo&s;ition to him, when by the wheel of fortune you had been thrown into Parliament.</P>
<P>What notions mu&s;t you have entertained of your own con&s;equence, when you could pro|po&s;e your&s;elf as a rival to Sir George Revel; and where mu&s;t have been your &s;en&s;es, when the way you took to recommend your&s;elf to the daughter was by offering in&s;ults to the fa|ther?</P>
<P>The bloody triumph you have had may be matter of exultation to you, and your uncle John and other ferocious companions, who make war their trade, and glory in the &s;laugh|ter of their fellow-creatures; but to me, who am a preacher of peace, it is horrible in the extreme, and it becomes my melancholy duty as a parent to make an effort, however hope|le&s;s, for awakening your con&s;cience to a &s;en&s;e of the&s;e enormities, be&s;eeching Heaven to turn your heart to repentance and avert the judg|ment, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e overtake you.</P>

<P>THAT I have been compelled into a duel with Sir George Revel is true, but that I have his blood upon my con&s;cience is not a fact, as that gentleman is out of danger from his wounds; neither will I believe, were I at liberty to explain all the motives, which nece&s;|&s;itated me to meet his &s;word, that even you would condemn me for the con&s;equences, had they been as fatal as you &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Surely, Sir, it is the part of every one who judges another to hear before he condemns, and I humbly conceive that paternal ju&s;tice is not &s;ingly exempt from that obligation; yet I have repeatedly fallen under your &s;entence upon information only; I &s;hall therefore be &s;ilent from appeal, and leave my character to &s;peak for it&s;elf: when you are di&s;po&s;ed to think more favorably of me, it &s;hall be from convic|tion

<P>THOUGH I am your younger brother, and under&s;tand my&s;elf well enough to know I can't argue with you in the way of learning, yet I believe I know a little of what is called common &s;en&s;e, and I hope I am not totally ignorant of what is called common ju&s;|tice, though I am as you &s;ay one of tho&s;e <HI>fero|cious</HI> people, who make <HI>war their trade.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XCVI. Lady Loui&s;a G. to the Counte&s;s of G.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Spring Grove.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY was the au&s;picious day that united Lady Jane to her beloved Mortlake, and tran&s;ported me to this place with my beloved Arundel. We all attended the happy couple to the altar, where the cere|mony was performed by a neighbouring clergy|man, an old friend of the hou&s;e of Arundel. Jane deported her&s;elf with all the fortitude and compo&s;ure in the world, and made her re&s;pon|&s;es audibly and firmly: not quite &s;o her e&s;pou&s;|ed; and as for poor me, I trembled mo&s;t in|continently, and whenever my eye caught a glimp&s;e of Arundel, there were no bounds to my tremor. Awful as the ceremony is in it|&s;elf, and more particularly &s;o as it appeared to me when deciding upon the fate of a beloved friend, yet, to my &s;hame, I confe&s;s I was more than once mo&s;t &s;adly put to it to keep my
<PB N="238" REF="239">
countenance, when the old Admiral roared out the re&s;pon&s;es &s;o much above the key-note of the clerk, and the re&s;t of us, who made up the congregation, that I and even Arundel him|&s;elf were forced to cram our handkerchiefs into our mouths, e&s;pecially as the good man was not always very correct, and occa&s;ionally took &s;ome &s;mall liberties with the text, parti|cularly where the mini&s;ter repeated&mdash;<HI>Be unto them a tower of &s;trength</HI>&mdash;the Admiral &s;ung out in a voice of thunder, as if he was upon his own quarter-deck, <HI>From the face of all our enemies</HI>&mdash;at which moment I am per&s;uaded he had a &s;ide-way hit at the French and Spani|ards, for his voice was not only particularly exalted, but there was an energy in his tone, which convinces me he had them in his thoughts: he had a large folio prayer-book &s;pread before him and a huge pair of &s;pec|tacles on his no&s;e, which made him as irre|&s;i&s;tible to the &s;ight as to the hearing.</P>
<P>After the ceremony was over we repaired to the par&s;onage, where an elegant little col|lation was &s;et out in the library, and here with tears of joy I embraced and congratulat|ed my beloved Lady Jane Mortlake: Lord S.
<PB N="239" REF="240">
and the Admiral were &s;etting off for London as well as our&s;elves, &s;o that we all parted from the bride and bridegroom at the &s;ame moment. Alas! the fortitude, which my poor Jane had exerted at the altar, here for|&s;ook her at the moment, when &s;he found her|&s;elf, perhaps, for the la&s;t time (which Heaven avert!) in the arms of her beloved brother.&mdash;Oh, my dear, dear Archibald, &s;he cried, may the God of all mercies pre&s;erve thee from death, and give thee victory in battle! Go, my hero! go to certain conque&s;t, and let not my fond weakne&s;s unman thee; thy &s;i&s;ter &s;hall pray for thee, Mortlake &s;hall put up his prayers to that gracious Being, who&s;e ble&s;&s;|ing is upon us in this moment of our union, and who will not refu&s;e the petitions of his faith|ful &s;ervant&mdash;And oh, my father and my friend, &s;he added, (throwing her arms round the neck of the gallant Admiral, who &s;tooped to em|brace her) may you return with fre&s;h laurels, to the joy of your friends here pre&s;ent, and to the glory of your country! She now threw her&s;elf down on the couch, whil&s;t tears &s;uch as heroes &s;hed fell from the eyes of the de|parting warriors.&mdash;Let us &s;eize this moment
<PB N="240" REF="241">
and be gone, &s;aid my father; Mr. Mortlake, we beg you will &s;tay with your lady, and take no further notice of us.&mdash;The word was in&s;tant|ly obeyed by all; Arundel took my hand, the Admiral put his arm under the Earl's, and my father led the way: we threw our&s;elves with|out ceremony into our re&s;pective carriages, and were whirled away with a rapidity, which tho&s;e who have not travelled po&s;t in England have no idea of.</P>
<P>Thus is grief compounded in our brighte&s;t joys, and the cup of ble&s;&s;ing is for ever da&s;hed with tears.&mdash;My father fir&s;t broke &s;ilence, by de&s;iring us to take our own conver&s;ation with|out regarding him, as he &s;hould amu&s;e him&s;elf with his own thoughts and reflections upon the &s;cenes he had left behind, without interrupt|ing us in our di&s;cour&s;e: Con&s;ider your&s;elves, my dear children, &s;aid he, as man and wife elect, talk over your own little projects, follow your own inclinations, your endearments, your fondne&s;&s;es to each other, as if nobody was pre&s;ent, or at mo&s;t an old nur&s;e, who will only drop a &s;alt tear over your care&s;&s;es, and chuckle at the happine&s;s of her beloved bantling.</P>
<P>Having &s;o &s;aid, he took the hand of Arundel
<PB N="241" REF="242">
and drew him to that &s;ide of the coach where I was &s;eated by my&s;elf, &s;tretching him|&s;elf over the back &s;eat at the &s;ame time, in an attitude as if he was going to &s;leep.&mdash;My &s;weet Loui&s;a, &s;ays Arundel, &s;ince your father is no longer pre&s;ent, I mu&s;t give &s;ome vent to my heart, by telling you how deeply it is affected by his goodne&s;s to us both; the honor he has done me by this vi&s;it, the confidence he repo&s;es in me on all occa&s;ions, and the happine&s;s he has &s;howered upon me in ble&s;&s;ing me with all my &s;oul holds dear on this &s;ide heaven, have rai&s;ed emotions in my heart, that I &s;hall never be in a capacity of doing ju&s;tice to; you, my charmer, mu&s;t find occa&s;ion for telling him how truly I revere and love him; I know no other way of expre&s;&s;ing my gratitude to him, but by my everla&s;ting devotion to his lovely daughter.</P>
<P>My father took my hand, and joining it to Arundel's, tenderly pronounced a ble&s;&s;ing up|on us, and as my head reclined on Arundel's &s;houlder, contemplated us with a look of infi|nite &s;en&s;ibility and affection. We then by de|grees fell into di&s;cour&s;e upon the happy event of the morning, and of Jane's &s;olemn and com|po&s;ed
<PB N="242" REF="243">
behaviour at the altar, with which my father was greatly &s;truck, but owned that the Admiral's re&s;pon&s;es put his mu&s;cles to the trial: he demanded of me, if I thought I could &s;tand the office as heroically as &s;he did; I &s;hook my head and Arundel &s;miled upon me; he then began to prai&s;e her to the &s;kies for her noble qualities, and declared he was never more affected than by her manner of parting from her brother; my father was no le&s;s warm in his encomiums upon Mortlake, which made Arundel's fine eyes gli&s;ten with delight: we talked over their whole e&s;tabli&s;hment, and my father was in raptures whil&s;t he expatiated on the Paradi&s;e, as he called it, in which they were placed, &s;aying to Arundel with a &s;mile&mdash;The only fault I can find with you, &s;on Arun|del, is, that you are too rich.&mdash;This put me in mind of Jane's addre&s;s to Solitude, which I &s;ent you in my la&s;t letter, and having a copy in my pocket-book, I made Arundel read the lines aloud; by &s;uch an audience the beloved author was &s;ure to be applauded.</P>
<P>We next amu&s;ed our&s;elves with planning projects of improvements at Arundel Hou&s;e,
<PB N="243" REF="244">
in which I &s;tiffly contended for the antient lares, which to my ta&s;te were infinitely more venerable than all the extravagancies of mo|dern foppery in brick and plai&s;ter; &s;ome|thing I allowed might be admitted without violating their prerogative, but &s;till I thought the line was to be followed which they point|ed out, and in this Arundel agreed with me. My father ob&s;erved that he &s;eemed to be very well e&s;tabli&s;hed in point of &s;ervants, and for his part he could not &s;ee any occa&s;ion he had to encrea&s;e them: Arundel acknowledged that he did not think it could add to our happi|ne&s;s to be encumbered with a very numerous &s;uite of idlers, and &s;eemed to apply to me for my opinion in the matter. I told him that my notions of dome&s;tic oeconomy had been formed upon your le&s;&s;ons and in&s;tructions repeatedly im|printed on my thoughts, and confirmed by what little judgment and experience I could boa&s;t of, &s;o that I was at no lo&s;s to expre&s;s my&s;elf with|out he&s;itation on the &s;ubject. I &s;et out by &s;aying, that as I wi&s;hed to acquit my&s;elf as became the mi&s;tre&s;s of his family, it was the fir&s;t point with me to have my hou&s;ehold upon &s;uch a &s;cale as I could compleatly &s;uperintend and
<PB N="244" REF="245">
manage; if I had a parcel of &s;uperfluous and idle people about me, how could I undertake for this? I would wi&s;h my hu&s;band in the fir&s;t place to take an exact computation of his in|come, clear and unencumbered as it came into his hands; upon that computation I would have him lay down his general &s;cale of ex|pence, and regulate every article of it, as far as could be done upon previous calculation; upon this there ought to be a con&s;iderable balance for contingencies of various &s;orts, &s;uch as building, improving, bounties, and a long li&s;t of unfore&s;een demands upon his ta&s;te or charity. Beyond this income, be it what it may, I would on no account &s;uffer my expences to go; wherever they threa|tened to exceed it, the reform mu&s;t be im|mediate and effectual; for there could be no peace in my mind while his fortune was dimini&s;hing, and the greater that fortune was, the greater would be my &s;elf reproach for &s;o inexcu&s;able a wa&s;te of it. That mere parade I dete&s;ted from my heart, and next to gaming I held electioneering as a mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable and &s;en&s;ele&s;s profu&s;ion of property. That I took the opportunity now to &s;ay in the mo&s;t
<PB N="245" REF="246">
peremptory manner, and I hoped my fa|ther, who heard me &s;ay it, would not di&s;|commend me for it, that I would ab&s;olutely not con&s;ent to accept a &s;ingle diamond from the hands of Arundel.&mdash;Here Arundel &s;tared, and my father nodded a&s;&s;ent with a &s;mile of ap|probation.&mdash;As for plate, I perceived he had enough of it, and equipage to plea&s;e me mu&s;t be as &s;imple and unpretending as po&s;&s;ible. I wi&s;hed to rival no lady, pure or impure, in the &s;plendor of her carriage. I was too proud to pique my&s;elf upon &s;uch di&s;tinctions, for the merit of which I was to re&s;ort to Long-acre. The chief part of our time, money and atten|tion would, I hoped, be addre&s;&s;ed to the country, and there I &s;hould wi&s;h to be carry|ing on a con&s;tant and gradual improvement, rather than a rapid and expen&s;ive one; not only as it would be a la&s;ting plea&s;ure to us, who were occupied in it, but as it would give a more permanent employment to our labo|rious poor; of them I &s;hould be ambitious of collecting a colony about me, lodged in com|fortable cottages within my eye, and not driven into holes and corners of the earth to make room for my un&s;ocial and tyrannical
<PB N="246" REF="247">
ideas of monopolizing a whole country for what is fal&s;ely called ornament and pro&s;pect; their habitations would be the be&s;t ornament of my pro&s;pect, their population my pride, and the contemplation of their comforts my reward.&mdash;Here Arundel in an ec&s;tacy of joy threw his arms round my neck and &s;mothered me with ki&s;&s;es. My father clapt his hands as it were involuntarily together, and ex|claimed aloud, That's right, my dear Arun|del, &s;he challenges your love.&mdash;The&s;e tender and encouraging care&s;&s;es prompted me to pro|ceed yet further, and I re&s;umed my di&s;cour&s;e in &s;ub&s;tance as follows:&mdash;Regularity in hours is e&s;&s;ential to the good order and comfort of a family; in the country there is no excu&s;e for not conforming to it, neither can I by any means approve of tho&s;e fine people, who adopt their London hours in their country hou&s;es, putting their neighbours who vi&s;it them either out of their own habits and cu&s;|toms, or (which is wor&s;e) teaching them to copy bad examples, and &s;o corrupting the &s;implicity of manners, &s;o well becoming their condition and fortune. This is a thing that I abominate; it is founded in affectation of
<PB N="247" REF="248">
high life; the very people who adopt it &s;uffer by it; it is un&s;ocial, in&s;ulting and ridiculous in the extreme. No one can contend that it is a better di&s;tribution of a day in &s;ummer (which is generally the &s;ea&s;on when the rich retire into the country) to ri&s;e in the hear of the forenoon, take our exerci&s;e in the mid|day, and dedicate the refre&s;hing hours of evening to the indolence and luxury of the table. Surely &s;uch an arrangement of hours is the rever&s;e of every thing that plea&s;ure would teach us, were we to con&s;ult no other guide; but there are a thou&s;and other rea|&s;ons again&s;t it, which are aggravations of its ab&s;urdity. As for my table, I would cau|tiou&s;ly avoid that overbearing &s;plendor, which &s;eems more calculated to di&s;play my own con&s;equence, than to contribute to the com|fort of my gue&s;ts. I would wi&s;h to do no|thing that &s;hould pique my neighbours of inferior fortune into emulation, or provoke their envy: I would keep an uniform table, in which comfort &s;hould be chiefly con&s;idered and elegance by no means overlooked; all &s;hould be welcome, and &s;et dinners as much a po&s;&s;ible avoided: my &s;upreme &s;ocial delight
<PB N="248" REF="249">
would be to engage &s;uch a party of amiable and entertaining people within my own family circle as would make the hours, that we pa&s;&s;ed within doors, both lively and improv|ing; men and women of elegant minds, peo|ple of talents, eminent arti&s;ts, re&s;pectable fo|reigners, plea&s;ant and good-natured compa|nions, who have the faculty of exhilarating our convivial hours, are tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ociety I &s;hould covet, and the happy ca&s;e with which we have at la&s;t learnt to live with each other under the &s;ame roof, would leave me &s;till at my lei&s;ure for all the demands which the care of my family might have upon me in the mean time. Upon this &s;y&s;tem I do not &s;ee any opening in a man of fortune's time for the in&s;ipid di&s;&s;ipations of a li&s;tle&s;s life, for the de&s;perate re&s;ource of gaming, for the perpe|tual hurry of journies from place to place, for the whim of a racehor&s;e, or even the din of a pack of hounds. What an endle&s;s fund of amu&s;ing occupation is there in a dome&s;tic farm! Whil&s;t my hu&s;band &s;uperintended the more intere&s;ting concerns of &s;tock and culti|vation, I could find perpetual employment in the &s;maller departments; and I think there is
<PB N="249" REF="250">
nothing would give me &s;uch health and plea|&s;ure as to be &s;o engaged. I &s;hould regret the day, when I was to quit my dairy for London and the drawing-room&mdash;And now methinks I mu&s;t have pretty well wearied you both with my reveries.</P>
<P>They were &s;o polite as to a&s;&s;ure me they were by no means tired of li&s;tening to me; and Arundel, with an air of the greate&s;t &s;ince|rity, prote&s;ted, that he had &s;et down every word in his memory, and would faithfully adhere to it, by adopting my &s;y&s;tem with the &s;tricte&s;t conformity to every rule.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear mother, our time in&s;en&s;ibly pa&s;&s;ed away, whil&s;t we were rapidly approach|ing to our journey's end, which &s;et us &s;afely down at Spring Grove before the darkne&s;s overtook us, where, after a night of happy re|po&s;e, in which the events of the day were compounded into a dream, wherein my hap|pine&s;s was painted afre&s;h in all the wild and glowing colours of romantic fancy, I aro&s;e to execute this plea&s;ing ta&s;k, and then to realize the vi&s;ions of the night by flying into the arms of love and Arundel.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XCVIII. Lady Jane Mortlake to Lady Loui&s;a G.</HEAD>
<P>IN the maideni&s;h &s;implicity of my heart I promi&s;ed you a long letter, but I mu&s;t break my word with you. Out of all the many injunctions which you laid upon me, I can obey one only, and that is&mdash;literally to write and no more. I know my dear Loui&s;a
<PB N="254" REF="255">
will be in a pet with me, but I will leave it to time to apologize for my indolence; before many days come to an end you may have &s;ympathetic motives for acquitting me.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure Mr. Mortlake will obey the call of his friend and come to you at Spring Grove, when the happy day is fixt; but I rather think I mu&s;t forego the undertaking, e&s;pecially as you will come down to Arundel Hou&s;e on the day of your marriage, and to that re&s;olution I would advi&s;e you to adhere.</P>
<P>But is this the languid &s;tile I &s;hould u&s;e to my Loui&s;a? No, I will not clo&s;e my letter till I a&s;&s;ure you, gratefully a&s;&s;ure you, every pro&s;|pect of happine&s;s opens upon me&mdash;exce&s;s of it you know, my dear, will overpower the &s;pi|rits, and even force us to put on the very &s;ymptoms of &s;orrow. I am charmed with every thing about me; external comforts &s;ur|round me in abundance;
<Q>But I have that within which pa&s;&s;eth &s;hew.</Q>
The&s;e are but the &s;ymphonies (if I may &s;o call them) the accompaniments of that &s;uperior &s;train of harmony, which breathes in every look, action, and endearing movement of my

beloved Mortlake; &s;uch a heavenly temper beams upon me, &s;uch a gay, &s;erene and placid mind, affections &s;o inexpre&s;&s;ibly tender, &s;uch love, &s;uch ardour; oh, my Loui&s;a, what a trea|&s;ure am I ble&s;&s;ed with in this ine&s;timable man! As for his under&s;tanding, it &s;eems to me like an exhau&s;tle&s;s mine of the pure&s;t ore; he and your matchle&s;s Arundel have not mi&s;pent the early morning of their life in di&s;&s;ipation and intemperance, but with a prudent foreca&s;t have been &s;toring up re&s;ources for the even|ing of their day, for the night, wherein no one can work.</P>
<P>In a very few days I hope I &s;hall begin to apportion out my time upon &s;y&s;tem, and regu|late both my little family and my&s;elf: I do not mean to engro&s;s my hu&s;band's hours &s;o entirely, as not to leave him a part of the day in which his library &s;hall be unapproachable by me; I &s;hould be unpardonable were I to break in upon duties of &s;o &s;erious a nature as belong to his function, and to which he is &s;o con&s;cientiou&s;ly devoted; his &s;tudies therefore have a claim upon him which I &s;hall hold as &s;acred, and tho&s;e hours I &s;hall pa&s;s in my do|me&s;tic employments, and, when they do not

<HEAD>LETTER XCIX. Sir Jo&s;eph Arundel to the Earl of G.</HEAD>
<P>THE re&s;pect, with which I have ever looked up to your Lord&s;hip, and the elevated rank in which you &s;tand, would never have permitted me to think of an alliance with your family but as the mo&s;t improbable of all events, had not your letter informed me that an union between your amiable noble daughter and my
<PB N="257" REF="258">
&s;on is likely &s;oon to take place, under the &s;anction of your con&s;ent and good liking.</P>
<P>My Lord, I am at a lo&s;s what words to u&s;e upon this occa&s;ion: I cannot deny that I have &s;een &s;ome particulars of Mr. Arundel's con|duct with an eye of di&s;plea&s;ure, and I have given him my fatherly reproof accordingly: of this &s;ort have been his deportment in Par|liament, and his duel with Sir George Revel; I confe&s;s I wrote har&s;hly to him on tho&s;e to|pics; but I will not be ob&s;tinate again&s;t convic|tion; I may have been mi&s;informed, nay more than that, I may have erred in judgment; but my intentions have been &s;incere. You are plea&s;ed to take his defence very warmly upon your&s;elf, and your words mu&s;t ever have the greate&s;t weight with me; &s;tronger proof can|not be given of the confidence you have in him than that you have thought him worthy of being honored with the hand of Lady Lou|i&s;a, your only child: this is a te&s;timony as honorable to him as it is unexpected by me, and above all hope of mine.</P>
<P>My Lord, I am a &s;eque&s;tered man and move in a very private &s;phere; a title indeed has de&s;cended upon me, but it has de&s;cended empty; it did not plea&s;e my brother Francis,
<PB N="258" REF="259">
living or dying, to take any notice of me, and I am given to under&s;tand by my brother John, that no part of his &s;poils are likely to be be|&s;towed on me: the&s;e accumulations center in my &s;on; his fortune is ample and independant, and therefore as he does not want my help, I the le&s;s wonder at the contempt he &s;hews for my opinion or advice: it is from your Lord|&s;hip I learn the honor and happine&s;s which await him.</P>
<P>But though I have thus detached my&s;elf from the world and all its ambition, yet I am a man, and have the feelings of a man, and con&s;i&s;tently with tho&s;e feelings it will be im|po&s;&s;ible for me to pre&s;ent my neglected per&s;on at the haughty doors of that unbrotherly man|&s;ion, who&s;e owner never permitted me to enter them, nor gave me the welcome I had a right to expect. This I flatter my&s;elf will appear &s;o natural to your Lord&s;hip, that you will al|low it a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for my &s;eeming omi&s;|&s;ion, if I do not pay that re&s;pect to Lady Lou|i&s;a in her married &s;tate, which as your Lord|&s;hip's daughter I have ever entertained for her.</P>

<P>I HAVE received your &s;ummons and &s;hall fly to obey it with every ardent wi&s;h, with every anxious prayer for your happine&s;s; it is my lot to have been the object of the marriage ceremony before I have been the performer of it in right of my function; may the com|mencement be au&s;picious!</P>
<P>My dear Arundel, it is now the fir&s;t time in my remembrance, that whil&s;t writing to you I have pau&s;ed upon my pen, and found that my mind would not furni&s;h words to &s;upply it. The fact is, my imagination is locked up by repletion, &s;o many grateful thoughts throng and pre&s;s upon it at the &s;ame moment, that language cannot extricate them: you have &s;howered down benefits upon your friend &s;o fa&s;t, that though I am in no danger of forget|ing them, I am in no capacity of particulariz|ing them.

<P>There was a my&s;tery in old times, which the &s;uper&s;tition of the initiated keep &s;acred from

<P>I find my&s;elf with a companion, in who&s;e &s;ociety no hour of the day can be heavy; her lively genius gives a novelty to every &s;ubject, and we mutually in&s;truct each other: &s;he tells me of the world as it is, I inform her of the world as it hath been. It gives me inexpre&s;|&s;ible delight to find that her &s;pirits are not damped by retirement and the t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te of a hu&s;band, on the contrary their gaiety en|crea&s;es every day, and I may truly &s;ay we have <HI>never waked but to a joyful morning:</HI> the tem|porary depre&s;&s;ion &s;he felt upon parting from her beloved brother is long &s;ince at an end, and her buoyant mind ri&s;es &s;uperior to tho&s;e gloomy and un&s;ocial thoughts, which deal in melancholy predictions and feed their &s;pleen with horrors of their own painting; &s;he on the contrary &s;ees all futurity in its brighte&s;t light, and by the force of a &s;anguine fancy meets her gallant hero returning with fre&s;h laurels to her arms, and fea&s;ts upon the idea.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263">As for me, who by one of the mo&s;t rapid tran&s;itions of fortune am of a &s;udden tran&s;|planted from college rooms and the twentieth part of a bed-maker's attendance to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of an elegant hou&s;e and a family of &s;er|vants, what &s;hould I have done without her help? Things, which no time would have brought to my under&s;tanding, &s;he &s;ees and comprehends in a moment; it is incredible with what facility &s;he arranges her dome&s;tic matters, and though every order is given with the mo&s;t perfect &s;weetne&s;s of temper, yet there is no trifling with her commands; the &s;tricte&s;t obedience is exacted and of cour&s;e obtained. The machine, now put in motion by her guid|ing hand, goes on mechanically and with cor|rect regularity, and for my part I &s;hall be to|tally out of employ, unle&s;s I keep &s;ome little land in my hands, which my lovely friend ad|vi&s;es me to do. She is accomptant-general of my finances, and has furni&s;hed her&s;elf with a huge vellum book, and all the apparatus of a clerk, which I &s;hould never have thought of, and &s;uffered accordingly: &s;he &s;ays our in|come will amply &s;uffice for our e&s;tabli&s;hment, and leave &s;ome loo&s;e money for unfore&s;een

occa&s;ions on the balance; but I had no op|portunity of talking with you about the very kind offer, which Lord G. made me of a do|native of &pound;. 300 <HI>per annum,</HI> that has lately elap&s;ed: I was really &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed with bounty from all hands, that I did not know what an|&s;wer to make him, when I ought in gratitude to have &s;aid a great deal; I mu&s;t rely upon you to help me out, by telling him what an awkward animal I am, when my friends con|found me with their goodne&s;s, and at the &s;ame time be &s;ure to &s;ay in the mo&s;t &s;incere and na|tural way to his Lord&s;hip, that I mu&s;t believe he has a number of expectants, who look up to him for favors, and who&s;e long attendance has given them far better claims upon his pa|tronage than I can pretend to; if therefore he has any one of the&s;e in his eye, I be&s;eech him to pa&s;s me over, and my gratitude will &s;till be paid to his good wi&s;hes. But if on the con|trary his de&s;ire to do a grace to you in the per&s;on of your friend, prevails again&s;t all other claims, I then beg of him to add a further grace to his bounty by be&s;towing it upon her, from whom I derive every preten|&s;ion and to whom I owe every ble&s;&s;ing in

life, and let her, by who&s;e hand I am rai&s;ed, and on who&s;e &s;miles I live, appropriate to her private pur&s;e, that which to me would be a &s;uperfluity. In God's name what am I? what right have I to be thus care&s;&s;ed by fortune? I already &s;ink under the ble&s;&s;ings I enjoy; my own unworthine&s;s flies in my face and I trem|ble for the trials which pro&s;perity may expo&s;e me to. I am determined, Arundel, to humble my&s;elf even below what I am by nature; there is nobody but your&s;elf and my deare&s;t Lady Jane to whom I dare give a vent to the hap|pine&s;s of my heart, for fear my exultation &s;hould be mi&s;taken for in&s;ult; to my country neighbours, and particulary to my brethren of the cloth, I am re&s;olved nothing &s;hall e&s;cape me to provoke their ill opinion of me as a man intoxicated by good fortune, or to put them upon enquiring how I merited what has befallen me: in &s;hort, my dear friend, I have called my&s;elf to a &s;trict account, and find I have no chance for pre&s;erving the favor of Providence, but to humble my&s;elf with double diligence before God and man, and to pray for &s;upport under the mo&s;t dangerous of all trials, the trial of unmerited pro&s;perity.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="266">Lady Jane was de&s;irous upon her wedding-day to give &s;ome little bounty to the poor of the pari&s;h, and con&s;ulted me upon it; I &s;hew|ed her a little book, in which I had minuted down the particulars of all the needy families, the number, ages and &s;ex of their children, with the occupation, condition and nece&s;&s;ities of their parents; I had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee &s;he was very much plea&s;ed by this account, which &s;he con&s;idered as an in&s;tance of my at|tention to the duties of a pari&s;h prie&s;t; &s;he was at the trouble of copying my li&s;t, and has begun her vi&s;itation in con&s;equence of it.

<P>Arundel, I repeat to you my re&s;olution of never quitting the flock, which you have put under my care: I will not make your bounty a &s;tepping-&s;tone to my ambition, and of this I took an early opportunity to appri&s;e Lady Jane, without which explanation I thought it would have been di&s;honourable to have enter|ed into engagements with her: I need not &s;ay

that her noble and di&s;intere&s;ted nature approv|ed of my re&s;olution.</P>

perfectly re&s;tore it; di&s;&s;ipation would but open all its wounds.</P>
<P>Let me not deceive you, nor give occa&s;ion for future di&s;content, when you find your&s;elf betrayed by pity into a &s;tep, which you have cau&s;e to repent of. It is enough for me to know my&s;elf acquitted in your thoughts, to hear that my beloved child is happy, and now and then to find my&s;elf in the kind remem|brance of tho&s;e who are dear to me. Place me in &s;ome quiet retreat, where I may pa&s;s my days in that ob&s;curity for which nature de&s;igned me, and if ever that happy period &s;hall arrive, when your heart is &s;ated with worldly plea&s;ures and pur&s;uits, turn to my &s;o|litude, &s;eek your humble friend, and my arms &s;hall be open to receive and welcome you to purer and more peaceful &s;cenes than tho&s;e you leave behind you.</P>

<P>I thank you for your kind attention to me in &s;ending Davi&s;on; he is a good creature and has been of great u&s;e and comfort to me; the money he brought with him is &s;o much more than my occa&s;ions call for, that I &s;hall have no demand to make upon the credit you have given me at O&s;tend: this &s;upply in the mean time has enabled me to &s;hew &s;ome little marks of my gratitude to Madame Polberg, which have been very &s;ea&s;onable to the worthy crea|ture, and have added much to the few com|forts left for her in this life.

You have flattered me with the hopes of coming to me after the wedding, unle&s;s I prevented you by &s;etting out upon Davi&s;on's arrival: this I was &s;trongly tempted to do, that I might prevent your trouble; but great as was my joy when I received &s;uch in&s;tances of your returning kindne&s;s, my health and &s;pi|rits were &s;till unequal to the undertaking, for to &s;ay the truth I am far from well; a low fe|ver hangs about me, and I take little re&s;t or nouri&s;hment: come to me therefore, my dear Lord, and repay your&s;elf by a double piece of charity, for I think you may be able to do Madame Polberg a &s;ervice with the Imperial mini&s;ter, by &s;tating the ca&s;e of the Baron, as it came under your cognizance, and it is to be hoped that your te&s;timony will a&s;&s;i&s;t her &s;uit

for obtaining ju&s;tice. Thus you &s;hall at once receive the widow's ble&s;&s;ing, and the grateful thanks of your devoted wife.

<HEAD>LETTER CII. The Counte&s;s to Lady Loui&s;a G.</HEAD>
<P>ALL joy to my beloved child! Your mo|ther, who fled to this &s;olitary dwelling with no better hope, than to &s;ecrete her&s;elf from calumny and unkindne&s;s, has found it a &s;cene of bu&s;y revolutions, &s;elected as it were by Providence to perform its wonders in, and by the mo&s;t extraordinary coincidence of chances to bring the accu&s;er face to face with the accu&s;ed, and extort confe&s;&s;ion from a guil|ty heart under the terrors of impending death.</P>
<P>What unexpected happine&s;s has followed the di&s;covery of that wicked plot! How much beyond all hope was the pre&s;ervation of that
<PB N="273" REF="274">
de&s;perate man, the lea&s;t of who&s;e wounds &s;eemed to take away all chance of life! How adorable was the divine Grace, which in&s;pired him with repentance, and moved him to make atonement for his crimes by a clear, compleat and explicit confe&s;&s;ion! Who could have be|lieved that your father's heart would have been &s;o converted from its re&s;entment, and turned upon the &s;udden with &s;uch benignity towards Arundel! What remained for you but to wa&s;te your life in bewailing his obduracy, or el&s;e to have &s;unk your character by precipi|tating your&s;elf into a clande&s;tine marriage again&s;t the prote&s;t of your parent? Haple&s;s al|ternative! and yet where was your hope but in the choice of the&s;e difficulties?&mdash;When be|hold at once, in the mo&s;t unexpected moment, the hand of Heaven is laid upon your father's heart, the quickening touch revives that con|&s;cience, which &s;eemed dead within him, the regenerate &s;pirit of mercy in&s;pires him with new feelings, peace and reconciliation take place, Arundel is adopted, my prayers are granted and my child is ble&s;t.</P>
<P>Now, Loui&s;a, I conjure you by your gra|titude to that beneficent Power, which has
<PB N="274" REF="275">
brought the&s;e mighty things to pa&s;s, let the&s;e reflections never fade in your mind: remem|ber what it is you owe, a debt that your whole life can never overpay. Be dutiful, affectionate and tender to your father; remember what he has done for you; call to mind what daggers he has drawn from your bo&s;om, and &s;trike not a thorn, though the &s;lighte&s;t and lea&s;t painful, into his: cheri&s;h him in his age, pity him in his infirmities, &s;ooth him in tho&s;e li&s;tle&s;s hours, when life becomes a load: let him be ever welcome to your doors, open your arms to receive him, though he bring no mirth or gaiety with him, and make allowances for the dullne&s;s of that evening, which is too apt to clo&s;e the day, that has been &s;acrificed to am|bition; though his mind may decay let not your charity lo&s;e its vigour, and let the daugh|ter's ho&s;pitality be the parent's a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>In my letter to your father I took the liberty of hinting to him how ble&s;t I &s;hould be if he could detach his mind from worldly pur&s;uits, and take this opportunity of his re|ce&s;s from office to &s;eek tranquillity in the country: let me entreat you to co-operate with my wi&s;hes, and as your influence is
<PB N="275" REF="276">
great, to exert it for his happine&s;s. Grant for a moment that he was rein&s;tated in his former po&s;t, what can he gain by it? not any new acce&s;&s;ion of dignity; for what is that honor, of who&s;e in&s;tability he has had &s;uch recent ex|perience? and if he &s;eeks it without obtain|ing it, a fruitle&s;s pur&s;uit does but &s;ink his character and di&s;grace his politics. On the contrary, if he avails him&s;elf of his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from public affairs, and without impatience or repining takes up the re&s;pectable character of an independant nobleman, all mankind will give him credit for the di&s;inte&s;tedne&s;s of his pa&s;t &s;ervices, and not impute them to the greedine&s;s of power, but to a patriot zeal for his country's good.</P>
<P>As for your own conduct in a married &s;tate, the le&s;&s;ons which I &s;hould have repeated have been &s;o faithfully remembered by you, and &s;o aptly applied, that you have antici|pated all I had to &s;ay on that &s;ubject: tho&s;e rules are now become your own, and I tru&s;t you will never want per&s;everance in following what your rea&s;on adopts.</P>
<P>In Mr. Mortlake and Lady Jane you will have the be&s;t neighbours in the world, and I
<PB N="276" REF="277">
flatter my&s;elf they will both contribute to your happine&s;s and them&s;elves enjoy it. The &s;pecimen you &s;ent me of her poetry plea&s;ed me much, and the &s;ubject &s;till better than the execution of it. I beg you will pre&s;ent to them my mo&s;t cordial congratulations.</P>
<P>Mr. Arundel has &s;o long commanded every good and zealous wi&s;h of my heart, that it would be but idle ceremony to repeat them now: as the hu&s;band of my Loui&s;a he will have my warme&s;t affection; but I mu&s;t be|&s;eech both him and you not to think of coming hither, as you kindly offered: no, my dear, that is a &s;acrifice I will by no means allow you to make; and le&s;t what I have &s;aid may not be &s;ufficient to divert you from it, remember that I po&s;itively forbid it. As my health is &s;omewhat impaired, I think it not improbable I &s;hall try a winter in the &s;outh of France, to which I am advi&s;ed, and have the offer of all nece&s;&s;ary pa&s;&s;ports for the purpo&s;e. Let me hope I &s;hall then return to you with better &s;pirits, and a more e&s;ta|bli&s;hed &s;tate of health.</P>
<P>Sir George Revel is gone to Bareges, from which place he has written me a letter full of
<PB N="277" REF="278">
acknowledgments; and I am well plea&s;ed to hear that he advances in his recovery. It will be long before he returns to England.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot a circum&s;tance, which I &s;hould more properly have mentioned in my letter to your father; but I de&s;ire you will tell him, that upon ob&s;erving what you &s;ay to him and Mr. Arundel about diamonds, I &s;hall be extremely happy, with his approbation, to transfer my jewels to you, and I do earne&s;tly reque&s;t he will con&s;ent to my de&s;ire.

<P>I DISPATCH my &s;ervant Le Maitre with the joyful intelligence of our beloved daugh|ter's marriage, on which event I congratulate with you mo&s;t cordially and mo&s;t affection|ately.</P>
<P>The week that Arundel has pa&s;&s;ed here en|dears him to me above mea&s;ure: never did I contemplate a character more truly amiable, and I flatter my&s;elf I am now received into his heart: he did not give him&s;elf &s;o wholly up to lover like dalliances as to exclude me from his attentions, but on the contrary I had many hours in private with him, and in the&s;e friendly conferences he opened to me the whole &s;tate of his affairs, and it was with plea|&s;ure I found him perfect ma&s;ter of them, and thoroughly di&s;po&s;ed to confine him&s;elf to &s;uch a &s;cheme of living, as will for ever &s;ecure him from exceeding them: I mu&s;t do Loui&s;a the
<PB N="282" REF="283">
ju&s;tice to &s;ay that it is her plan, or rather your's, which he has adopted in its full extent; &s;o &s;olid an under&s;tanding as his will never depart from rules &s;o e&s;&s;ential to dome&s;tic comfort, and &s;o conformable to right rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The bride and bridegroom &s;et off in their po&s;t-chai&s;e for Arundel Hou&s;e &s;oon after the ceremony was over, but I reque&s;ted Mr. Mort|lake and Lady Jane to pa&s;s the day with me, which they very charitably con&s;ented to, and great comfort they afford me thereby, for they are lovely people.</P>
<P>I am now a &s;olitary being upon earth till your friendly and forgiving heart &s;hall receive me once again and for ever; to that virtuous, that ble&s;&s;ed a&s;ylum I am ha&s;tening, impatient to atone to you for all your cruel &s;ufferings, and to approve my&s;elf a fond and faithful hu&s;band for the re&s;t of our days.</P>
<P>Every thing in your letter (except the ac|count of your health, which heavily afflicts me) meets my perfect approbation: believe me on my word, Loui&s;a, I have taken a la&s;t leave of all the vanity and ambition of this world, and devote my&s;elf to you and tho&s;e endearing ties,
<PB N="283" REF="284">
which wrap our hearts together. I have at la&s;t got &s;ight of tranquillity, and made ac|quaintance with true happine&s;s and peace of heart; &s;hall I forfeit their acquaintance? Ne|ver. The reform you point out I have already put in motion, and my agent has in&s;tructions to &s;et my hou&s;e in town to &s;ale; the &s;ame &s;hall be done by this villa, if you recommend it, but as it was once a favorite with you, I po&s;t|pone its &s;entence till you give final judgment upon it: I have no holdings towards it; com|pared to the &s;uperior claim of my hereditary re&s;idence it is but as a mi&s;tre&s;s to a lawful wife, and I &s;hall throw it off without a &s;igh. Upon a clo&s;e review of my dome&s;tics I find a parcel of &s;poilt puppies fit for little el&s;e but furni&s;hing the hall of a Mini&s;ter's hou&s;e, and I have accordingly bequeathed them to the public, not chu&s;ing to annex &s;uch lumber to a &s;ober family upon a country e&s;tabli&s;hment; we will have no &s;uch fellows about us. Arun|del's &s;ervants have been all drilled by the late general and are in perfect di&s;cipline; they are not a numerous corps but they are well train|ed, and move with the regularity of machines. I offered him our town hou&s;e, if he had been
<PB N="284" REF="285">
di&s;po&s;ed to have exchanged it for his own, but he &s;ays it is too large and &s;tately and will have nothing to do with it. You would be charmed with the mode&s;t &s;implicity of their equipages; he is fond of hor&s;es, but does not &s;eem to have that pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;table, which young men of his age are &s;o apt to have; his ruling pa&s;&s;ion is that which &s;ympathizes with our Loui&s;a's; a mutual love po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them wholly; as for our dear doating girl, though you well know and have often trembled for the uncommon &s;en&s;ibility of her heart, and its pronene&s;s to the tendere&s;t of all affections, &s;till you can form no gue&s;s at the exce&s;&s;ive fond|ne&s;s every look, each word and every action expre&s;s for the beloved of her &s;oul: I can &s;peak only of what I have &s;een, and doubtle&s;s &s;he has put &s;ome check upon her&s;elf in my company; what I have not &s;een can be only matter of conjecture, and as her darling's &s;en|&s;ations &s;eem to the full as quick as her own, I am apt to think for both their &s;akes I have not married them an hour too &s;oon, though our deeds are far from completed. Arundel would not take a guinea from my hands upon the marriage, as he knew I did not over-abound
<PB N="285" REF="286">
in ca&s;h: I forced a thou&s;and pounds upon Loui&s;a, out of which &s;he bought a few, and but a few, articles of apparel; as for pin|money &s;he rejected the idea with abhorrence. The rents of the e&s;tate, which with the barony of G. go to Loui&s;a in ca&s;e I die without heir male, I have turned over to Arundel, and the reform I have made, and &s;hall further make, in my e&s;tabli&s;hment, will more than an&s;wer to that defalcation of my income; &s;o that you and I &s;hall be more than rich enough for all the dignified enjoyments of life, and liberally provided for the charities of it; as for the&s;e beloved creatures, I only fear they will be wealthy to a &s;urfeit.</P>
<P>I am only waiting for news of their &s;afe ar|rival, and then I &s;hall &s;et out by the way of Margate and O&s;tend, between which there is a pacquet-boat that pa&s;&s;es under the Emperor's colours: I &s;hall have no one but a &s;ervant with me, as I am prepared to find you in a very &s;mall hou&s;e, and be&s;eech you not to hurry your &s;pirits about preparations for me; the humble&s;t diet and the meane&s;t lodging will be preferable to all earthly &s;plendors in my e&s;ti|mation, if you greet me with the &s;mile of ap|probation
<PB N="286" REF="287">
and forgivene&s;s, and if I am &s;o ble&s;t as to find you recovering of that indi&s;po&s;ition you complain of, and which has rai&s;ed a thou|&s;and anxious alarms in my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Le Maitre has orders to meet me at O&s;tend with an account of your health and what other commands you may plea&s;e to give him. In obedience to your wi&s;hes I have &s;earched out &s;ome papers relative to Baron Polberg's nego|tiation in England, which I flatter my&s;elf will be of u&s;e to the widow's cau&s;e: the Imperial prime mini&s;ter is a very noble gentleman, and a lover of ju&s;tice; I don't de&s;pair of rendering Madame Polberg &s;ome &s;ervices, if her ca&s;e is rightly &s;tated.</P>

Had I been told before I married Arundel, that my love for him would admit of an increa&s;e, I &s;hould have &s;purned at the idea, now I find it had been truly &s;aid, for he is ten times dearer to me than ever; &s;urely my affection is of a &s;ofter quality, the fires that love had lighted in my heart now melt it, and whil&s;t my eyes dwell on his engaging form, the tears in&s;tinctively flow from them, and though I &s;mile, I weep: he is now out of the room giving &s;ome orders to his &s;ervants, el&s;e I could not write &s;o compo&s;edly as I do.

<P>This unfore&s;een journey will oblige me to throw &s;ome trouble on your dear hu&s;band, to whom I &s;hall take the liberty of addre&s;&s;ing certain powers and commi&s;&s;ions for the re|gulation of my affairs at home, particularly as to the &s;ale of my hou&s;e in Gro&s;venor Square, and al&s;o of my villa at Spring Grove, both which we have jointly determined to di&s;po&s;e of: I mu&s;t likewi&s;e de&s;ire him to forward the pre&s;entation to Mr. Mortlake's donative, which I left in the hands of my worthy agent, Mr. Green of Lincoln's Inn.</P>
<P>This is the compleate&s;t &s;olitude that can

well be imagined; it is early morning, and yet I have had the melancholy curio&s;ity to vi&s;it the ever memorable &s;pot in the center of the adjoining wood, where your beloved hu&s;band, like Heaven's avenging mini&s;ter, &s;truck pride and calumny to the ground. It was a &s;cene to call forth all the feelings of my heart; con|&s;cience did not pa&s;s it over lightly; I humbled my&s;elf to the earth, and poured forth my thank&s;givings to that merciful Being, who has vouch&s;afed to &s;hower &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings on his unde&s;erving creature.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Candid and friendly Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THESE Letters, which I have pre&s;ented to thee, hoping they may &s;erve to amu&s;e an hour or two of thy lei&s;ure, have been collected and arranged by me with &s;ome pains in the &s;eries as they now &s;tand, but when the principal cor|re&s;pondents were married, and the two brides became neighbours, letter-writing no longer was their concern; they had other bu&s;ine&s;s upon their hands: but though I cannot for this rea&s;on gra|tify thy curio&s;ity with their epi&s;tolary corre&s;pon|dence, yet if what thou ha&s;t read of their pa&s;t &s;tory &s;hould intere&s;t thee to be told of their &s;uc|ceeding pro&s;perity in the married &s;tate, I have the plea&s;ure to inform thee that their dome&s;tic happine&s;s has known no interruption.</P>
<P>Arundel and his charming Lady are as much in love with each other as ever; they have &s;trict|ly adhered to that rational plan they &s;et out with, and are beloved and ble&s;&s;ed by all their neighbours, rich and poor; by gradual improve|ments
<PB N="297" REF="298">
they have beautified their place to a very high degree, from the &s;uperfluities of their income: Loui&s;a's gardens, flower-hou&s;es, dairy and poul|try are the admiration of the whole neighbour|hood; Arundel's farm-hou&s;es, cottages, woods and grounds are the talk of the country, and happy are tho&s;e tenants and laborers who live under him. He is a very re&s;pectable mem|ber of Parliament, but no parti&s;an; upon all great que&s;tions he is &s;ure to be found in his place and nobody is better heard in the Hou&s;e, but as to taking office I believe there are few things he is more adver&s;e to. Lady Loui&s;a has brought him four fine children, and if I am rightly in|formed his family con&s;i&s;ts of two boys and two girls.</P>
<P>The Reverend Mr. Mortlake and Lady Jane are wedded to their delicious retirement, and if there is happine&s;s on earth, this amiable couple is in the enjoyment of it. The harmony of their friend&s;hip with the hou&s;e of Arundel has gone on without check or abatement, for the hateful &s;pirit of envy cannot &s;ow di&s;cord in &s;uch hearts as they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of: they are adored by their pari&s;h|ioners, and beloved by all who know them. Lady
<PB N="298" REF="299">
Jane is the happy mother of five beautiful chil|dren, who, with the little Arundels, make a charming group of playfellows.</P>
<P>The Earl and Counte&s;s of G. after pa&s;&s;ing a winter in the &s;outh of France, came home the be&s;t of friends, and are retired to their country &s;eat, where they con&s;tantly re&s;ide, except when they make a vi&s;it to their beloved connections at Arun|del Hou&s;e. The mind of that amiable Lady being healed of all its &s;orrows, &s;he has recovered her health and &s;pirits, and Lord G. declares he has at la&s;t di&s;covered wherein true happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Admiral John Arundel having fought the good fight, has laid him&s;elf up for the peace in a &s;nug little tenement within a few miles of his nephew, which he has fitted up as near as po&s;&s;ible to the model of his &s;hip's cabin, where he enjoys him&s;elf after his own humour: it is a joyful holiday to all the children when he comes over to Arundel Hou&s;e, as there is no &s;uch playfellow in the world as uncle John.</P>
<P>The gallant Earl of S. having cleared his pa|ternal e&s;tate from encumbrances and put it into good condition with part of the &s;um he gained by
<PB N="299" REF="300">
his captures, has married a Mi&s;s Dormer, who is a very amiable and accompli&s;hed lady; &s;he is neice to old Lady Treville and the Hon. Mrs. Dormer, and will inherit their forturnes, which are very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Sir Jo&s;eph Arundel has paid the debt of na|ture, but not before he had &s;een his errors, and reconciled him&s;elf to his worthy &s;on by a vi&s;it to Arundel Hou&s;e, where he was received with great kindne&s;s and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Sir George Revel is at la&s;t returned to Eng|land not more perfectly healed of his wounds than by them; he is in all re&s;pects a reformed man, and has married a lady of a noble Huguonot fa|mily in the &s;outh of France, who promi&s;es to make him an excellent wife, and to whom he &s;eems very truly attached.</P>
<P>And now, kind Reader, if thou wilt allow a &s;pare corner on thy &s;helf for the&s;e little volumes and not throw them by with di&s;dain, I hope they will repay thy courte&s;y &s;ome rainy evening, when a trifling book may take its turn for want of bet|ter company; or peradventure they may give thee a lift up a hill, or through the &s;ands, when thy chai&s;e is &s;lowly dragged by a pair of weary po&s;t-hor&s;es,
<PB N="300" REF="301">
hor&s;es, and thy mind without &s;omething to feed upon would perchance be as weary as the bea&s;ts that draw thee. At any time, or in any temper, though they may only lull thee into a placid nap, &s;o they amu&s;e thy fancy and not offend thy morals, tru&s;t me there does not live a man, who will more truly rejoice to plea&s;e thee than</P>
