<HEAD>ANSWERS FOR JOHN and WILLIAM CUNINGHAMS and Company, brewers in Gla&s;gow; JAMES HOTCHKIS and Company, brewers in Edin|burgh; and JAMES GRAHAM vintner in Gla&s;gow; for them|&s;elves, and as tru&s;tees for the other creditors of WILLIAM M'GREGOR late tenant in the lands of Parkhall, and others: TO The PETITION of ROBERT HAMILTON of Wi&s;haw.</HEAD>
<P>THE general que&s;tion at i&s;&s;ue between Mr Hamilton of Wi&s;haw, and the other creditors of M'Gregor, in the proce&s;s of multiple poinding, pre&s;ently depending in this Court, is, Whether the various tacks which Wi|&s;haw had granted to M'Gregor of &s;undry farms for a long cour&s;e of years, adjudged by Wi&s;haw him&s;elf as a creditor of M'Gre|gor's, were al&s;o adjudgeable by M'Gregor's other creditors, &s;o as to bring them in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with Wi&s;haw, the&s;e being within year and day of Wi&s;haw's adjudication?</P>
<P>IT was objected on the part of Wi&s;haw, That as &s;ome of the&s;e tacks, particularly that of Ea&s;ter-Park and Birkenhill, though granted to M'Gregor and his heirs for a term of no le&s;s than 57 years, excluded a&s;&s;ignees and &s;ub-tenants, except by the &s;pecial con&s;ent of the proprietor, &s;uch tacks were not adjudgeable.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="2">IT was on the other hand contended for the creditors, That however effectual &s;uch clau&s;es might be to exclude voluntary a&s;&s;ig|nees, they could not be effectual to exclude the legal diligence of creditors by adjudication, e&s;pecially in tacks &s;uch as the&s;e, for &s;uch a long term of years, granted to the lea&s;ee and his heirs, in which there could be no <HI>dilectio per&s;onarum.</HI> 2dly, That whatever &s;hould be the judgment of the law upon this point, the tack of Ea&s;ter-Park and Birkenhill was attended with &s;uch &s;pecial circum|&s;tances as ought to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the other lea&s;es containing the like clau&s;e; in &s;o far as it was thereby conditioned, that M'Gregor &s;hould be at liberty to &s;ub&s;et tho&s;e parts of the lands which lay on the &s;outh &s;ide of the toll-road, during the fir&s;t nine|teen years of the lea&s;e; and in &s;o far as it was thereby al&s;o con|ditioned, that Wi&s;haw &s;hould be at liberty to make void &s;aid tack at the term of Martinmas 1799, upon his making payment to M'Gregor of <HI>L.</HI> 70: 5: 2 Sterling. 3dly, As Wi&s;haw had &s;tated certain objections to the adjudications of the other creditors found|ed upon an alledged <HI>pluris petitio,</HI> and had thereupon prevailed in obtaining the whole of the&s;e other adjudications, that of James Graham only excepted, to be voided <HI>in totum,</HI> the creditors upon their part &s;tated certain objections to Wi&s;haw's adjudication, as &s;ufficient to void it al&s;o <HI>in totum,</HI> whereby the other creditors and he would be &s;o far in <HI>pari ca&s;u.</HI></P>
<P>THE re&s;ult of all which was, that the Lord Auchinleck Ordina|ry, by &s;everal interlocutors &s;tated in the reclaiming petition for both parties, &s;u&s;tained the objection pleaded for Wi&s;haw, founded upon that clau&s;e of the tack of Ea&s;ter-Park and Birkenhill, ex|cluding a&s;&s;ignees and &s;ub-tenants; and found &s;aid &s;eclu&s;ion effec|tual, not only again&s;t voluntary a&s;&s;ignees, but al&s;o again&s;t legal a&s;&s;ignees by adjudication; and con&s;equently that the creditors of M'Gregor, by their adjudication of the tack of Ea&s;ter-Park and Birkenhill, can take nothing, and have no title to compete with Wi&s;haw.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, As Graham's adjudication was free from the objection of the <HI>pluris petitio,</HI> and does, <HI>inter alia,</HI> adjudge the tack of Ea&s;ter-Park and Birkenhill, his Lord&s;hip found the &s;ame effectual to carry &s;o much of the lands of &s;aid tack as M'Gregor was at liberty to &s;ub&s;et; and that it was equally effectual to carry the &s;um of
<PB N="3" REF="3"><HI>L.</HI> 70, which by &s;aid tack Wi&s;haw was bound to pay to M'Gre|gor in the event of his taking advantage of the breach thereby al|lowed to him. 3dly, His Lord&s;hip repelled the objections &s;tated by the other creditors to Wi&s;haw's adjudication. The fir&s;t and la&s;t of the&s;e points was &s;ubmitted to your Lord&s;hip's review by a re|claiming petition at the in&s;tance of the other creditors, and which, with the an&s;wers thereto made on the part of Wi&s;haw, is hitherto unadvi&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT Wi&s;haw, not &s;atisfied with the advantage thereby gained over the other creditors, at lea&s;t equally onerous, has, along&s;t with his an&s;wers to the creditors petition, preferred a reclaiming peti|tion upon his part, praying an alteration of tho&s;e interlocutors whereby Graham's adjudication is found effectual to carry the a|fore&s;aid tack of Ea&s;ter-Park and Birkenhill, <HI>quoad</HI> &s;uch part of the lands therein contained as M'Gregor was empowered to &s;ub&s;et, as al&s;o to carry the <HI>L.</HI> 70 which Wi&s;haw was bound to pay to M'Gregor in the event of his taking advantage of the breach in the tack thereby allowed; which counter-petition being appoint|ed to be an&s;wered, the following an&s;wers are humbly &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>AND in the entry it is proper to ob&s;erve, That, if the creditors &s;hall prevail by judgment of your Lord&s;hips in having it found, that the clau&s;e in all or any of the tacks granted to M'Gregor by Wi&s;haw, excluding a&s;&s;ignees or &s;ub-tenants, does only exclude vo|luntary a&s;&s;ignations, but not the legal diligence of creditors by ad|judication, that will of cour&s;e &s;uper&s;ede any judgment upon the points &s;tated in Wi&s;haw's reclaiming petition: But uncertain, as the creditors are, what the judgment of the Court may be upon that capital point, they will confine what they are now humbly to offer in &s;upport of the Lord Ordinary's judgment, upon the other two points complained of by Wi&s;haw.</P>
<P>IN the more early periods of the law, tacks were e&s;teemed mere per&s;onal contracts, and therefore, however effectual again&s;t the granter and his heirs, were not binding upon third parties, &s;ingu|lar &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the lands; and viewing them in that light, were &s;o &s;trictly interpreted, as to exclude either a&s;&s;ignees or &s;ub-tenants, without any expre&s;s covenant to that purpo&s;e: But when tacks were by &s;tatute rendered real rights, as the rigour and &s;everity of
<PB N="4" REF="4">the law in other particulars was gradually abated, and as it is now an e&s;tabli&s;hed law that lea&s;es may be granted to &s;ub&s;i&s;t for any gi|ven length of time, it is adver&s;e to every principle of ju&s;tice, that any beneficial e&s;tate &s;hould be placed beyond the reach of lawful creditors, though this mu&s;t be the unavoidable con&s;equence of the doctrine here maintained on the part of Wi&s;haw. The granting an a&s;&s;ignment or &s;ub-tack does not annul the principal tack; &s;o that if this tack, however beneficial, was not to be adjudgeable, M'Gre|gor would be intitled to hold the &s;ame, and laugh at his creditors.</P>
<P>IN a tack of this endurance, which is nearly equal to a perpe|tuity, there could be no <HI>dilectio per&s;onarum,</HI> the heirs of the lea&s;ee being equally unknown to the lea&s;or as any other per&s;ons. And if the creditors are well advi&s;ed, this &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>dilectio per&s;onarum,</HI> in the choice of a particular per&s;on, is the only &s;olid principle upon which the exclu&s;ion of a&s;&s;ignees or &s;ub-tenants can be ju&s;tified. The &s;eclu&s;ion of a&s;&s;ignees and &s;ub-tenants, by a clau&s;e in the tack it&s;elf, cannot operate more &s;trongly than the exclu&s;ion by force of the law: So that as, in the one ca&s;e, the diligence of creditors by adjudication was not under&s;tood to be excluded, no good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned why, in the other ca&s;e, the expre&s;&s;ing what would be implied, &s;uppo&s;ing the tack had contained no &s;uch clau&s;e, &s;hould produce &s;o much a &s;tronger effect. Such is plainly the import of the clau&s;e re&s;pecting &s;ub&s;ets, which could only be granted by the voluntary act and deed of M'Gregor; and there is equal rea&s;on that the &s;ame con&s;truction &s;hould take place with regard to a&s;&s;ign|ments, the clau&s;e being one and the &s;ame as to both.</P>
<P>AND when to this is added the faculty or power of &s;ub&s;etting, allowed by this tack, of &s;o large a part of this farm, for a term of no le&s;s than 19 years, it furni&s;hes a &s;trong handle, that the clau&s;e &s;ecluding a&s;&s;ignees and &s;ub-tenants, was only meant to exclude voluntary not legal a&s;&s;ignees.</P>
<P>SUCH is plainly the import of the clau&s;e with re&s;pect to &s;ub&s;ets. If M'Gregor had granted a &s;ub&s;et for a term of 19 years of that part of the farm which he was &s;pecially authori&s;ed to &s;ub&s;et, there cannot be a doubt that the &s;ame mu&s;t have been effectual, and con&s;equently, that the benefit ari&s;ing to M'Gregor by that &s;ub&s;et mu&s;t have been adjudgeable by his creditors, as the law will
<PB N="5" REF="5">never permit any beneficial right belonging to a debtor to be placed without the reach of his lawful creditors. It is true that M'Gregor has not in this ca&s;e granted &s;uch &s;ub&s;et, but by con|tracting debts he has done what is equivalent, as the law will ad|judge every right that was in him, or that he had power to grant, in payment to his creditors. If M'Gregor had granted a &s;ub&s;et of the&s;e lands to his creditors, with power to them to apply the &s;urplus-rent over and above a ju&s;t proportion of the total tack-duty, in &s;ati&s;|faction of the debts due by him to his creditors, a &s;ub&s;et in the&s;e terms would not have been challengeable by Wi&s;haw; or if he had granted &s;uch &s;ub&s;et to any third per&s;on for an advanced rent, his lawful creditors mu&s;t have been intitled to have taken the be|nefit thereof for payment of their debts; and there is no other me|thod known in the law by which this could be obtained but by adjudication of his intere&s;t in the tack it&s;elf, and &s;ub-lea&s;e, in &s;o far as he had power to &s;ub&s;et.</P>
<P>WISHAW is indeed plea&s;ed to contend, That the tack being <HI>uni|cum quid,</HI> for which one tack-duty is paid <HI>in cumulo,</HI> the creditors cannot be allowed to adjudge part of the tack for which no parti|cular rent had been fixed by agreement between him and M'Gre|gor, and that he cannot be obliged to &s;ubmit to the divi&s;ion of the rent by the conjectural e&s;timation of witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT was this to be the con&s;equence of the power and liberty to &s;ub&s;et this part of the farm, Wi&s;haw would have him&s;elf only to blame for granting the lea&s;e in tho&s;e terms, which he ought to have fore&s;een might be productive of &s;uch con&s;equences. There is no difficulty in a&s;certaining what part of the total rent corre|&s;ponds to the different parts of this farm. This mu&s;t have been in the view of parties, when liberty was granted to M'Gregor to &s;ub|&s;et a certain part thereof. The &s;ub&s;et behoved to a&s;certain a rent or tack-duty payable by the &s;ub-lea&s;ee for that part of the ground allowed to be &s;ub&s;et. And as Wi&s;haw could not have demanded from the &s;ub-tenant more than the tack-duty payable by the &s;ub|&s;et, it is plain, that the divi&s;ion of the rents corre&s;ponding to the grounds retained or &s;ub&s;et, mu&s;t have been in the view of parties.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6">And as Wi&s;haw has him&s;elf adjudged this tack, it demon|&s;trates his own &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding of the matter, <HI>viz.</HI> That the clau&s;e, &s;ecluding a&s;&s;ignees and &s;ub-tenants without the con|&s;ent of him the proprietor, intended no more but an exclu&s;ion of voluntar a&s;&s;ignees. The adjudication which he him&s;elf took, can bear no other con&s;truction. That is his only title in this compe|tition; and if it was adjudgeable at his in&s;tance, it mu&s;t be e|qually competent at the in&s;tance of M'Gregor's other creditors, e&s;pecially as to that part of the farm which M'Gregor was em|powered to &s;ub&s;et.</P>
<P>WISHAW is indeed plea&s;ed to content, That there is a mate|rial difference between a power to a&s;&s;ign and to &s;ub&s;et, in this re&s;pect, that an a&s;&s;ignation denudes the principal tack&s;man of the lea&s;e altogether, and ve&s;ts the right wholly in the a&s;&s;ignee; where|as a &s;ub&s;et does not denude the principal tack&s;man, who remains &s;till liable for the total rent.</P>
<P>THE creditors cannot agree to this di&s;tinction; becau&s;e, how|ever true it may be that an a&s;&s;ignation transfers the whole right to the a&s;&s;ignee, it will not from thence follow, that the cedent is thereby liberated from his original obligation for payment of the rent or tack-duty. The ma&s;ter may thereby have the &s;uper|added &s;ecurity of the a&s;&s;ignee's being al&s;o bound for payment of the rent, but which can never liberate the original tack&s;man from the obligation which he had came under to make good the rent during the whole years of the lea&s;e; &s;o that, in this re&s;pect, the a&s;&s;ignee and &s;ub-tenant are in <HI>pari ca&s;u.</HI></P>
<P>IF A, by minute of &s;ale, &s;hall di&s;pone lands to B, his heirs and a&s;&s;igns, whereby B is taken per&s;onally bound in payment of a certain reddendo or duty, though B is at liberty to alienate the &s;ubject, and will no doubt &s;tipulate relief from the di&s;ponee of the reddendo payable to his author A, that will never liberate B, the fir&s;t di&s;ponee, from the per&s;onal obligation he had come under from being liable to A, in payment of the reddendo for which he was per&s;onally bound. And no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why a different rule &s;hould obtain with re&s;pect to a lea&s;e con|taining a power to a&s;&s;ign, as the granting &s;uch a&s;&s;ignation can|not liberate the original lea&s;ee from the obligation which he had
<PB N="7" REF="7">come under to pay the rent or tack-duty during the whole years of the lea&s;e. The a&s;&s;ignee may be bound to relieve him thereof at the hands of the lea&s;or; but he mu&s;t &s;till remain bound to the heritor for payment of the rent, in terms of his per&s;onal ob|gation.</P>
<P>THE power and faculty of &s;ub&s;etting &s;o large a part of the farm demon&s;trates this propo&s;ition, That there was here no <HI>dilectio per|&s;onarum,</HI> when M'Gregor was at liberty to &s;ub&s;et to any per&s;on he thought proper; and as the granting &s;uch a &s;ub&s;et mu&s;t, in the nature of things, have required a divi&s;ion of the rent payable for the lands &s;ub&s;et, from the total rent or tack-duty, the adjudica|tions taken again&s;t M'Gregor mu&s;t be effectual to carry his inter|e&s;t both in the tack and &s;ub&s;et, &s;o far as regards the lands which he was empowered to &s;ub&s;et: And thus far the Lord Ordinary's interlocutor falls to be affirmed.</P>
<P>THE other point determined by the Lord Ordinary's interlocu|tors, <HI>viz.</HI> That the adjudications deduced again&s;t M'Gregor were equally effectual to carry the <HI>L.</HI> 70 Sterling which Wi&s;haw was bound to pay to M'Gregor, in the event of his taking advantage of the breach allowed by the tack, depends upon the &s;ame princi|ples, and mu&s;t be governed by the &s;ame rules, <HI>viz.</HI> That as every beneficial right or intere&s;t competent to a debtor mu&s;t, in &s;ome &s;hape or other, be attachable by his creditors; and as, by the a|fore&s;aid agreement, <HI>L.</HI> 70 Sterling was a&s;certained to be the ju&s;t value of the &s;ubjects therein mentioned, for the remaining years of the lea&s;e, in ca&s;e Wi&s;haw &s;hould take advantage of the breach allowed of by the tack; it would be a cruel ca&s;e, if this &s;um, the agreed value of the tack for the remaining years thereof, &s;hould be pocketted up by Wi&s;haw, in exclu&s;ion of the other creditors ad|judgers.</P>
<P>THIS &s;um was the agreed e&s;timation or value of the tack for the remaining years of the lea&s;e after the 1799. It cannot be of le&s;s value now, in the 1770, when Wi&s;haw means to rea&s;&s;ume the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion 29 years before the term &s;pecified in the breach. That may be a ju&s;t con&s;ideration for enlarging the premium to be paid, but can never ju&s;tify the attempt that is made to pocket up that &s;um, in exclu&s;ion of the other creditors.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8">FOR though it is true that Wi&s;haw does not now claim the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e farms, in right of the &s;tipulated breach, but in virtue of his adjudication, if by means thereof he is to reap that advantage at &s;o much an earlier period than would have been the ca&s;e if M'Gregor had continued in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, ju&s;tice requires that he &s;hould make good to M'Gregor and his creditors the <HI>L.</HI> 70 Ster|ling, however &s;hort of the &s;ums expended by M'Gregor in the im|provement of the&s;e gounds.</P>
<P>AND therefore, to conclude upon this point al&s;o, it is hoped your Lord&s;hips will be of opinion with the Lord Ordinary, that the tack of tho&s;e lands, &s;o far as M'Gregor had power to &s;ub&s;et the &s;ame, is carried by their adjudications preferably to or <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with Wi&s;haw's adjudication, if the &s;ame &s;hall be &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>In re&s;pect whereof, it is hoped your Lord&s;hips will not only af|firm the Lord Ordinarys interlocutor's &s;o far as complained of by Wi&s;haw, but will alter the &s;ame &s;o far as complained of by the creditors.</HI> ALEX. LOCKHART.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
