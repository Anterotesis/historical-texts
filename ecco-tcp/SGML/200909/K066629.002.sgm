<HEAD>LECTURE XIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Duties owing to particular per&s;ons&mdash; duty of children to parents&mdash;re&s;pect and obedience&mdash;in what the former con&s;i&s;ts&mdash;in what the latter&mdash;&s;uccour|ing a parent&mdash;brotherly affection&mdash; obedience to law&mdash;founded on the ad|vantages of &s;ociety.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">FROM the two grand principles of "loving our neighbour as our|&s;elves; and of doing to others, as we would have them do to us," which re|gulate our &s;ocial intercour&s;e in general, we proceed to tho&s;e more confined du|ties, which ari&s;e from particular relati|ons, connections, and &s;tations in life.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e, we are fir&s;t taught, as indeed the order of nature directs, to con&s;ider the great duty of children to parents.</P>
<P>The two points to be in&s;i&s;ted on, are re&s;pect and obedience. Both the&s;e &s;hould naturally &s;pring from love; to which parents have the highe&s;t claim. And indeed parents, in general, behave to their children, in a manner both to de&s;erve and to obtain their love.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">But if the kindne&s;s of the parent be not &s;uch as to work upon the affections of the child, yet &s;till the parent has a title to re&s;pect and obedience, on the principle of duty; a principle, which the voice of nature dictates; which rea&s;on inculcates; which human laws, and human cu&s;toms all join to inforce; and which the word of God &s;trictly commands.</P>
<P>The child will &s;hew re&s;pect to his pa|rent, by treating him, at all times with deference. He will con&s;ult his parent's inclination; and &s;hew a readine&s;s in a thou&s;and namele&s;s trifles, to conform him&s;elf to it. He will never peevi&s;hly contradict his parent; and when he of|fers a contrary opinion, he will offer it mode&s;tly. Re&s;pect will teach him al&s;o, not only to put the be&s;t colouring upon the infirmities of his parent; but even
<PB N="5" REF="6">
if tho&s;e infirmities be great, it will &s;of|ten and &s;creen them, as much as po&s;&s;i|ble, from the public eye.</P>
<P>Obedience goes a &s;tep further, and &s;uppo&s;es a po&s;itive command. In things unlawful indeed, the parental authority cannot bind: but this is a ca&s;e that rarely happens. The great danger is on the other &s;ide, that children, through ob&s;tinacy, or &s;ullene&s;s, &s;hould refu&s;e their parents lawful commands; to the ob&s;ervance of all which, however in|convenient to them&s;elves, they are tied by various motives; and above all, by the command of God; who in his &s;acred denunciations again&s;t &s;in, ranks di&s;obe|dience to parents among the wor&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> i. 30.</NOTE></P>
<P>They are farther bound, not only to obey the commands of their parents;
<PB N="6" REF="7">
but to obey them chearfully. He does but half his duty, who does it not from his heart.</P>
<P>There remains &s;till a third part of filial duty, which peculiarly belongs to children, when grown up. This the catechi&s;m calls &s;uccouring, or admini&s;|tring to the nece&s;&s;ities of the parent; either in the way of managing his affairs, when he is le&s;s able to manage them him&s;elf; or in &s;upplying his wants, &s;hould he need a&s;&s;i&s;tance in that way. And this the child &s;hould do, on the united principles of love, duty, and gra|titude. The hypocritical jew would &s;ometimes evade this duty, by dedicat|ing to &s;acred u&s;es, what &s;hould have been expended in a&s;&s;i&s;ting his parent. Our Saviour &s;harply rebukes this per|ver&s;ion of duty; and gives him to un|der&s;tand, that no pretence of &s;erving
<PB N="7" REF="8">
God, can cover the neglect of a&s;&s;i&s;ting a parent. And if no pretence of &s;erving God can do it, &s;urely every other pre|tence mu&s;t &s;till be more unnatural.</P>
<P>Under this head al&s;o we may con&s;ider that attention, and love, which are due to other relations, e&s;pecially that mutual affection, which &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t between brothers. The name of brother expre&s;|&s;es the highe&s;t degree of tenderne&s;s; and is generally u&s;ed in &s;cripture, as a term of peculiar endearment, to call men to the practice of &s;ocial virtue. It reminds them of every kindne&s;s, which man can &s;hew to man. If then, we ought to treat all mankind with the affection of brothers, in what light mu&s;t they ap|pear, who being really &s;uch, are ever at variance with each other; continually doing &s;piteful actions, and &s;hewing upon every occa&s;ion, not only a want of bro|therly
<PB N="8" REF="9">
kindne&s;s; but even of common regard?</P>
<P>The next part of our duty, is "to honour and obey the king, and all that are put in authority under him."</P>
<P>By the "king, and all that are put in authority under him," is meant the various parts of the government we live under, of which the king is the head: and the meaning of the precept is, that we ought to live in dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to legal authority.</P>
<P>Government and &s;ociety are united. We cannot have one without the other; and we &s;ubmit to the inconveniences, for the &s;ake of the advantages.</P>
<P>The end of &s;ociety is mutual &s;afety and convenience. Without it, even
<PB N="9" REF="10">
&s;afety could in no degree be obtained: the good would become a prey to the bad: nay the very human &s;pecies to the bea&s;ts of the field.</P>
<P>Still le&s;s could we obtain the conve|niences of life; which cannot be had without the labour of many. If every man depended upon him&s;elf for what he enjoyed, how de&s;titute would be the &s;ituation of human affairs!</P>
<P>But even &s;afety and convenience are not the only fruits of &s;ociety. Man, living merely by him&s;elf, would be an ignorant, unpoli&s;hed &s;avage. It is the intercour&s;e of &s;ociety, which cultivates the human mind. One man's know|ledge, and experience is built upon ano|ther's; and &s;o the great edifice of &s;cience, and poli&s;hed life, is reared.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">To enjoy the&s;e advantages, therefore, men joined in &s;ociety; and hence it be|came nece&s;&s;ary, that government &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed. Magi&s;trates were crea|ted; laws made; taxes &s;ubmitted to; and every one, in&s;tead of righting him|&s;elf (except in mere &s;elf-defence) is in|joined to appeal to the laws he lives un|der, as the be&s;t &s;ecurity of his life and property.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Duty to our teachers, and in&s;tructors&mdash; ari&s;ing from the great importance of knowledge, and religion&mdash;and the great nece&s;&s;ity of gaining habits of at|tention, and of virtue in our youth &mdash;analogy of youth and manhood to this world and the next.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13">WE are next injoined "to &s;ubmit our&s;elves to all our governors, teachers, &s;piritual pa&s;tors, and ma&s;ters." Here another &s;pecies of government is pointed out. The laws of &s;ociety are meant to govern our riper years: the in&s;tructions of our teachers, &s;piritual pa&s;tors, and ma&s;ters are meant to guide our youth,</P>
<P>By our "teachers, &s;piritual pa&s;tors, and ma&s;ters," are meant all tho&s;e, who have the care of our education, and of our in&s;truction in religion; whom we are to obey, and li&s;ten to with humility, and attention, as the means of our advancement in know|ledge, and religion. The in&s;tructions we receive from them, are unque&s;tiona|bly &s;ubject to our own judgment in fu|ture life; for by his own judgment
<PB N="14" REF="14">
every man mu&s;t &s;tand, or fall. But, during our youth, it is highly proper for us to pay a dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their in&s;tructions, as we cannot yet be &s;uppo&s;ed to have formed any judgment of our own. At that early age, it &s;hould be our endeavour to acquire knowledge; and afterwards unpreju|diced to form our opinions.</P>
<P>The duty which young people owe to their in&s;tructors, cannot be &s;hewn bet|ter, than in the effect, which the in|&s;tructions they receive, have upon them. They would do well, therefore, to con|&s;ider the advantages of an early atten|tion to the&s;e two things, both of great importance, knowledge and religion.</P>
<P>The great u&s;e of knowledge in all its various branches (to which the learned languages are generally con&s;idered as an
<PB N="15" REF="15">
introduction) is to free the mind from the prejudices of ignorance; and to give it ju&s;ter, and more enlarged concepti|ons, than are the mere growth of rude nature. By reading, you add the ex|perience of others to your own. It is the improvement of the mind chiefly, that makes the difference between man and man; and gives one man, a real &s;uperiority over another.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the mind mu&s;t be employed. The lower orders of men have their at|tention much ingro&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e em|ployments, in which the nece&s;&s;ities of life engage them: and it is happy that they have. Labour &s;tands in the room of education; and fills up tho&s;e vacan|cies of mind, which in a &s;tate of idle|ne&s;s would be ingro&s;&s;ed by vice. And if they, who have more lei&s;ure, do not &s;ub&s;titute &s;omething in the room of this,
<PB N="16" REF="16">
their minds al&s;o will become the prey of vice; and the more &s;o, as they have the means to indulge it more in their power. A vacant mind is exactly that hou&s;e mentioned in the go&s;pel, which the de|vil found empty. In he entered; and taking with him &s;even other &s;pirits more wicked than him&s;elf, they took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is an undoubted truth, that one vice indulged, introduces others; and that each &s;ucceeding vice becomes more depraved.&mdash;If then the mind mu&s;t be employed, what can fill up its vacuities more rationally than the acqui&s;ition of knowledge? Let us there|fore thank God for the opportunities he hath afforded us; and not turn into a cur&s;e tho&s;e means of lei&s;ure, which might become &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>But however nece&s;&s;ary to us know|ledge may be, religion, we know, is
<PB N="17" REF="17">
infinitely more &s;o. The one adorns a man, and gives him, it is true, &s;uperi|ority, and rank in life: but the other is ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of youth, health, and abundance, the world is apt to appear a very gay, and plea&s;ing &s;cene; it en|gages our de&s;ires; and in a degree &s;a|tisfies them al&s;o. But it is wi&s;dom to con&s;ider, that a time will come, when youth, health, and fortune will all fail us; and if di&s;appointment, and vexa|tion do not &s;our our ta&s;te for plea&s;ure, at lea&s;t &s;ickne&s;s and infirmities will de|&s;troy it. In the&s;e gloomy &s;ea&s;ons, and above all, at the approach of death, what will become of us without religi|on? When this world fails, where &s;hall we fly, if we expect no refuge in another? Without holy hope in God, and re&s;ignation to his will, and tru&s;t in
<PB N="18" REF="18">
him for deliverance, what is there that can &s;ecure us again&s;t the evils of life?</P>
<P>The great utility therefore of know|ledge and religion being thus apparent, it is highly incumbent upon us to pay a &s;tudious attention to them in our youth. If we do not, it is more than probable, that we &s;hall never do it; that we &s;hall grow old in ignorance, by neglecting the one; and old in vice, by neglecting the other.</P>
<P>For improvement in knowledge, youth is certainly the fitte&s;t &s;ea&s;on. The mind is then ready to receive any im|pre&s;&s;ion. It is free from all that care, and attention, which, in riper age, the affairs of life bring with them. The memory too is then &s;tronger; and bet|ter able to acquire the rudiments of knowledge; and as the mind is then
<PB N="19" REF="19">
void of ideas, it is more &s;uited to tho&s;e parts of learning, which are conver&s;ant in words. Be&s;ides, there is &s;ometimes in youth a mode&s;ty, and ductility, which in advanced years, if tho&s;e years e&s;pecially have been left a prey to igno|rance, become &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, and pre|judice; and the&s;e effectually bar up all the inlets to knowledge.&mdash;But, above all, unle&s;s habits of attention, and ap|plication are early gained, we &s;hall &s;carce acquire them afterwards.&mdash;The incon&s;iderate youth &s;eldom reflects up|on this; nor knows his lo&s;s, till he knows al&s;o, that it cannot be retrieved.</P>
<P>Nor is youth more the &s;ea&s;on to ac|quire knowledge, than to form religious habits. It is a great point to get habit on the &s;ide of virtue. It will make every thing &s;mooth, and ea&s;y. The earlie&s;t principles are generally the mo&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="20">
la&s;ting; and tho&s;e of a religious ca&s;t are &s;eldom wholly lo&s;t. Though the temptations of the world may, now and then, draw the well-principled youth a&s;ide; yet his principles being continu|ally at war with his practice, there is hope, that in the end the better part may overcome the wor&s;e, and bring on a reformation. Whereas he, who has &s;uffered habits of vice to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his youth, has little chance of being brought back to a &s;en&s;e of religion. In a common cour&s;e of things it can rarely happen. Some calamity mu&s;t rou&s;e him. He mu&s;t be awakened by a &s;torm, or &s;leep for ever.&mdash;How much better is it then to make that ea&s;y to us, which we know is be&s;t? And to form tho&s;e habits now, which hereafter we &s;hall wi&s;h we had formed?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="21">There are, who would re&s;train youth from imbibing any religious principles, till they can judge for them&s;elves; le&s;t they &s;hould imbibe prejudice for truth. But why &s;hould not the &s;ame caution be u&s;ed in &s;cience al&s;o; and the minds of youth left void of all impre&s;&s;ions? The experiment, I fear, in both ca&s;es would be dangerous. If the mind were left uncultivated during &s;o long a period, though nothing el&s;e &s;hould find entrance, vice certainly would: and it would make the larger &s;hoots, as the &s;oil would be vacant. A boy had better receive knowledge and religion mixed with error, than none at all. For when the mind is &s;et a think|ing, it may depo&s;it its prejudices by de|grees, and get right at la&s;t: but in a &s;tate of &s;tagnation it will infallibly be|come foul.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="22">To conclude, our youth bears the &s;ame proportion to our more advanced life, as this world does to the next. In this life we mu&s;t form, and cultivate tho&s;e habits of virtue, which mu&s;t quali|fy us for a better &s;tate. If we neglect them here, and contract habits of an op|po&s;ite kind, in&s;tead of gaining that ex|alted &s;tate, which is promi&s;ed to our improvement, we &s;hall of cour&s;e &s;ink into that &s;tate, which is adapted to the habits we have formed.</P>
<P>Exactly thus is youth introductory to manhood; to which it is properly &s;peaking a &s;tate of preparation. During this &s;ea&s;on we mu&s;t qualify our&s;elves for the parts we are to act hereafter. In manhood we bear the fruit, which has in youth been planted. If we have &s;auntered away our youth, we mu&s;t ex|pect to be ignorant men. If indolence
<PB N="23" REF="23">
and inattention have taken an early po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of us, they will probably in|crea&s;e, as we advance in life; and make us a burden to our&s;elves, and u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ociety. If again, we &s;uffer our&s;elves to be mi&s;led by vicious inclinations, they will daily get new &s;trength, and end in di&s;&s;olute lives. But if we culti|vate our minds in our youth, attain habits of attention and indu&s;try, of vir|tue, and &s;obriety, we &s;hall find our|&s;elves well prepared to act our future parts in life; and, what above all things ought to be our care, by gaining this command over our&s;elves, we &s;hall be more able, as we get forward in the world, to re&s;i&s;t every new temptation, as it ari&s;es.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Behaviour to &s;uperiors&mdash;the word betters explained&mdash;probable rea&s;ons for God's appointing various di&s;tinctions among men&mdash;happine&s;s and mi&s;ery not con|nected with &s;tation.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="27" REF="25">WE are next injoined "to order our&s;elves lowly and reverently, to all our betters."</P>
<P>By our betters are meant they who are in a &s;uperior &s;tation of life to our own; and by "ordering our&s;elves low|ly and reverently towards them," is meant paying them that re&s;pect, which is due to their &s;tation.</P>
<P>The word betters indeed includes two kinds of per&s;ons, to whom our re&s;pect is due&mdash;tho&s;e, who have a natural claim to it; and tho&s;e who have an acquired one; that is, a claim ari&s;ing from &s;ome particular &s;ituation in life.</P>
<P>Among the fir&s;t, are all our &s;uperior relations; not only parents; but all other relations, who are in a line above
<PB N="28" REF="26">
us. All the&s;e have a natural claim to our re&s;pect.&mdash;There is a re&s;pect al&s;o due from youth to age; which is always becoming; and tends to keep youth within the bounds of mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>To others, re&s;pect is due from tho&s;e particular &s;tations, which ari&s;e from &s;o|ciety and government. Fear God, &s;ays the text; and it adds, "honour the king."</P>
<P>It is due al&s;o from many other &s;ituati|ons in life. Employments, honours, and even wealth will exact it; and all may ju&s;tly exact it, in a proper degree.</P>
<P>But it may here perhaps be inquired, why God &s;hould permit this latter di&s;|tinction among men? That &s;ome &s;hould have more authority than others, we can ea&s;ily &s;ee, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in
<PB N="29" REF="27">
government; but among men, who are all born equal, why &s;hould the goods of life be di&s;tributed in &s;o unequal a pro|portion?</P>
<P>To this inquiry, it may be an&s;wered, that, in the fir&s;t place, we &s;ee nothing in this, but what is common in all the works of God. A gradation is every where ob&s;ervable. Beauty, &s;trength; &s;wiftne&s;s, and other qualities, are varied through the creation in numberle&s;s de|grees. In the &s;ame manner likewi&s;e are varied the gifts of fortune, as they are called. Why therefore &s;hould one man's being richer than another, &s;ur|prize us more than his being &s;tronger than another, or more prudent?</P>
<P>Though we can but very inadequately trace the wi&s;dom of God in his works, yet very wi&s;e rea&s;ons appear for this
<PB N="30" REF="28">
variety in the gifts of fortune. It &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary both in a civil, and in a moral light.</P>
<P>In a civil light, it is the nece&s;&s;a|ry accompaniment of various employ|ments; on which depend all the advan|tages of &s;ociety. Like the &s;tones of a regular building, &s;ome mu&s;t range higher, and &s;ome lower; &s;ome mu&s;t &s;upport, and others be &s;upported; &s;ome will form the &s;trength of the building, and others its ornament; but all unite in producing one regular, and propor|tioned whole. If then different employ|ments are nece&s;&s;ary, of cour&s;e different degrees of wealth, honour, and con&s;e|quence mu&s;t follow; a variety of di&s;|tinctions, and obligations; in &s;hort, different ranks, and a &s;ubordination mu&s;t take place.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="29">Again in a moral light, the di&s;pro|portion of wealth, and other worldly adjuncts gives a range to the more ex|ten&s;ive exerci&s;e of virtue. Some virtues could but faintly exi&s;t upon the plan of an equality. If &s;ome did not abound, there were little room for temperance: if &s;ome did not &s;uffer need, there were as little for patience. Other virtues again could hardly exi&s;t at all. Who could practi&s;e genero&s;ity, where there was no object of it? Who, humility, where all ambitious de&s;ires were ex|cluded?</P>
<P>Since then providence, in &s;cattering the&s;e various gifts, propo&s;es ultimately the good of man, it is our duty to ac|quie&s;ce in this order, and "to behave our&s;elves lowly, and reverently" (not with &s;ervility, but with a decent re|&s;pect) "to all our &s;uperiors."</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="30">Before I conclude this &s;ubject, it may be proper to ob&s;erve, in vindication of the ways of providence, that we are not to &s;uppo&s;e happine&s;s and mi&s;ery nece&s;&s;arily connected with riches and poverty. Each condition hath its particular &s;ources both of plea&s;ure and pain, unknown to the other. Tho&s;e in elevated &s;tations have a thou&s;and latent pangs, of which their inferiors have no idea: while their inferiors again have as many plea&s;ures, which the others cannot ta&s;te. I &s;peak only of &s;uch modes of happine&s;s or mi|&s;ery as ari&s;e immediately from different &s;tations. Of mi&s;ery, indeed, from a variety of other cau&s;es, all men of every &s;tation are equal heirs; either when God lays his hand upon us in &s;ickne&s;s, or misfortune; or when, by our own follies and vices, we become the mini|&s;ters of our own di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="31">Who then would build his happine&s;s upon an elevated &s;tation? Or who would envy the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch happi|ne&s;s in another? We know not with what various di&s;tre&s;&s;es that &s;tation, which is the object of our envy, may be at|tended.&mdash;Be&s;ides, as we are accountable for all we po&s;&s;e&s;s, it may be happy for us, that we po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o little. The means of happine&s;s, as far as &s;tation can procure them, are commonly in our own power, if we are not wanting to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Let each of us then do his duty in that &s;tation which providence has a&s;|&s;igned him; ever remembering, that the next world will &s;oon de&s;troy all earthly di&s;tinctions.&mdash;One di&s;tinction only will remain among the &s;ons of men at that time&mdash;the di&s;tinction between good and bad; and this di&s;tinction it is worth all our pains and all our ambition to acquire.</P>

<P><PB N="37" REF="33">WE are next in&s;tructed "to hurt nobody by word, or deed&mdash;to be true and ju&s;t in all our dealings&mdash;to bear no malice nor hatred in our hearts &mdash;to keep our hands from picking and &s;tealing&mdash;our tongues from evil-&s;peak|ing, lying, and &s;landering."</P>
<P>The duties comprehended in the&s;e words are a little tran&s;po&s;ed. What &s;hould cla&s;s under one head is brought under another. "To hurt nobody by word, or deed," is the general propo&s;i|tion. The under parts &s;hould follow: Fir&s;t, "to keep the tongue from evil-&s;peaking, lying, and &s;landering;" which is, "to hurt nobody by word." Se|condly, "to be true and ju&s;t in all our dealings;" and "to keep our hands from picking and &s;tealing;" which is, "to hurt nobody by deed." As to the
<PB N="38" REF="34">
injunction, "to bear no malice nor hatred in our hearts," it belongs pro|perly to neither of the&s;e heads; but is a di&s;tinct one by it&s;elf. The duties being thus &s;eparated, I &s;hall proceed to explain them.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, of injuring our neighbour by our "words." This may be done, we find, in three ways; by "evil-&s;peak|ing, by lying, and by &s;landering."</P>
<P>By "evil-&s;peaking" is meant &s;peak|ing ill of our neighbour; but upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that this ill is the truth. In &s;ome circum&s;tances it is certainly right to &s;peak ill of our neighbour; as when we are called upon in a court of ju&s;tice to give our evidence; or, when we can &s;et any one right in his opinion of a per&s;on, in whom he is about to put an improper confidence. Nor can there
<PB N="39" REF="35">
be any harm in &s;peaking of a bad action, which has been determined in a court of ju&s;tice, or is otherwi&s;e become notorious.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, it is highly di&s;allowable to &s;peak wantonly of the characters of others from common fame; becau&s;e, in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, we find that &s;tories, which have no better foun|dation, are mi&s;repre&s;ented. They are perhaps only half-told&mdash;they have been heard through the medium of malice, or envy&mdash;&s;ome favourable circum&s;tance hath been omitted&mdash;&s;ome foreign cir|cum&s;tance hath been added&mdash;&s;ome trif|ling circum&s;tance hath been exaggerated &mdash;the motive, the provocation, or per|haps the reparation, hath been conceal|ed&mdash;in &s;hort, the repre&s;entation of the fact is, &s;ome way or other, totally dif|ferent from the fact it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="36">But even, when we have the be&s;t evidence of a bad action, with all its circum&s;tances before us, we &s;urely indulge a very ill-natured plea&s;ure in &s;preading the &s;hame of an offending brother. We can do no good; and we may do harm: we may weaken his good re&s;olutions by expo&s;ing him: we may harden him again&s;t the world. Perhaps it may be his fir&s;t bad action. Perhaps nobody is privy to it but our|&s;elves, Let us give him at lea&s;t one trial. Let us not ca&s;t the fir&s;t &s;tone. Which of our lives could &s;tand &s;o &s;trict a &s;crutiny? He only who is without &s;in him&s;elf can have any excu&s;e for treat|ing his brother with &s;everity.</P>
<P>Let us next con&s;ider "lying;" which is an intention to deceive by fal&s;ehood in our words.&mdash;To warn us again&s;t ly|ing, we &s;hould do well to con&s;ider the
<PB N="41" REF="37">
folly, the meanne&s;s, and the wickedne&s;s of it.</P>
<P>The folly of lying con&s;i&s;ts in its defeating its own purpo&s;e. A habit of lying is generally in the end detect|ed; and, after a detection, the liar, in|&s;tead of deceiving, will not even be be|lieved, when he happens to &s;peak the truth. Nay, every &s;ingle lie is attended with &s;uch a variety of circum&s;tances, which lead to a detection, that it is of|ten di&s;covered. The u&s;e generally made of a lie is to cover a fault; but as the end is &s;eldom an&s;wered, we only aggra|vate what we wi&s;h to conceal. In point even of prudence, an hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion would &s;erve us better.</P>
<P>The meanne&s;s of lying ari&s;es from the cowardice which it implies. We dare not boldly and nobly &s;peak the
<PB N="42" REF="38">
truth; but have recour&s;e to low &s;ub|terfuges, which always argue a &s;ordid, and di&s;ingenuous mind. Hence it is, that in the fa&s;hionable world, the word liar is always con&s;idered as a term of pe|culiar reproach.</P>
<P>The wickedne&s;s of lying con&s;i&s;ts in its perverting one of the greate&s;t ble&s;|&s;ings of God, the u&s;e of &s;peech, in making that a mi&s;chief to mankind, which was intended for a benefit. Truth is the great bond of &s;ociety. Fal&s;hood, of cour&s;e, tends to its di&s;&s;olution. If one man may lye, why not another? And if there is no mutual tru&s;t among men, there is an end of all intercour&s;e and dealing.</P>
<P>An equivocation is nearly related to a lye. It is an intention to deceive un|der words of a double meaning; or
<PB N="43" REF="39">
words, which, literally &s;peaking, are true, and is equally criminal with the mo&s;t downright breach of truth. When St. Peter a&s;ked Sapphira (in the 5th chap|ter of the Acts) "whether her hu&s;band had &s;old the land for &s;o much?" She an&s;wered, he had: and literally &s;he &s;poke the truth: for he had &s;old it for that &s;um, included in a larger. But having an intention to deceive, we we find the apo&s;tle con&s;idered the equi|vocation as a lye.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it is the intention to deceive, which is criminal: the mode of decep|tion, like the vehicle in which poi&s;on is conveyed, is of no con&s;equence. A nod, or &s;ign, may convey a lye as effectually, as the mo&s;t deceitful language.</P>
<P>Under the head of lying may be men|tioned a breach of promi&s;e. While a re|&s;olution
<PB N="44" REF="40">
remains in our own brea&s;ts, it is &s;ubject to our own review: but when we make another per&s;on a party with us, an engagement is made; and every en|gagement, though only of the lighte&s;t kind, &s;hould be punctually ob&s;erved. If we have added to this engagement a &s;olemn promi&s;e, the obligation is &s;o much the &s;tronger; and he who does not think him&s;elf bound by &s;uch an obligation, has no preten&s;ions to the character of an hone&s;t man. A breach of promi&s;e is &s;till wor&s;e than a lye. A lye is, &s;imply a breach of truth: but a breach of promi&s;e, is a breach both of truth and tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Forgetfulne&s;s is a weak excu&s;e. It only &s;hews how little we are affected by &s;o &s;olemn an engagement. Should we forget to call for a &s;um of money, of which we were in want, at an appointed
<PB N="45" REF="41">
time? Or do we think a &s;olemn pro|mi&s;e of le&s;s value, than a &s;um of mo|ney?</P>
<P>Having con&s;idered evil-&s;peaking and lying, let us next con&s;ider &s;landering. By &s;landering we mean, injuring our neighbour's character by fal&s;hood. Here we &s;till ri&s;e higher in the &s;cale of inju|rious words. Slandering our neighbour is the greate&s;t injury, which words can do him; and is, therefore, wor&s;e than either evil-&s;peaking, or lying. The mi&s;|chief of this &s;in depends on the value of our characters. All men, unle&s;s they be pa&s;t feeling, de&s;ire naturally to be thought well of by their fellow-crea|tures; a good character is one of the principal means of being &s;erviceable ei|ther to our&s;elves, or others; and among numbers, the very bread they eat, de|pends upon it. What aggravated inju|ry,
<PB N="46" REF="42">
therefore, do we bring upon every man, who&s;e name we &s;lander? And, what is &s;till wor&s;e, the injury is irrepa|rable. If you defraud a man; re&s;tore what you took, and the injury is re|paired. But, if you &s;lander him, it is not in your power to &s;hut up all the ears, and all the mouths, to which your tale may have acce&s;s. The evil &s;preads, like the winged &s;eeds of &s;ome noxious plants, which &s;catter mi&s;chief on a breath of air, and di&s;per&s;e it on every &s;ide, and beyond prevention.</P>
<P>Before we conclude this &s;ubject, it may ju&s;t be mentioned, that a &s;lander may be &s;pread, as a lye may be told, in various ways. We may do it by an in|&s;inuation, as well as in a direct manner; we may &s;pread it in a &s;ecret; or propa|gate it under the colour of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="43">I may add al&s;o, that it is a &s;pecies of &s;lander, and often a very malignant one, to le&s;&s;en the merits, or exaggerate the failings of others; as it is likewi&s;e to omit defending a mi&s;repre&s;ented character; or to let others bear the blame of our offences.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XVIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Injurious actions&mdash;law and ju&s;tice diffe|rent things&mdash;illu&s;trated by &s;everal in|&s;tances&mdash;malice and hatred ari&s;ing from the re&s;entment of injuries&mdash;ari|&s;ing from envy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="51" REF="45">HAVING thus con&s;idered injurious words, let us next con&s;ider inju|rious actions. On this head we are in|joined "to keep our hands from picking and &s;tealing, and to be true and ju&s;t in all our dealings."</P>
<P>As to theft, it is a crime of &s;o odious, and vile a nature, that one would ima|gine no per&s;on, who hath had the lea&s;t tincture of a virtuous education, even though driven to nece&s;&s;ity, could be led into it.&mdash;I &s;hall not, therefore, enter into a di&s;&s;ua&s;ive from this crime; but go on with the explanation of the other part of the injunction, and &s;ee what it is to be true and ju&s;t in all our deal|ings.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice is even &s;till more, if po&s;&s;ible, the &s;upport of &s;ociety, than truth: in|a&s;much
<PB N="52" REF="46">
as a man may be more injurious by his actions, than by his words. It is for this rea&s;on, that the whole force of human law is bent to re&s;train inju&s;tice; and the happine&s;s of every &s;ociety will increa&s;e, in proportion to this re&s;traint.</P>
<P>We very much err, however, if we &s;uppo&s;e, that every thing within the bounds of law is ju&s;tice. The law was intended only for bad men; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to make the me&s;hes of it &s;o &s;trait, but that many very great enormi|ties will e&s;cape. The well meaning man, therefore, knowing, that the law was not made for him, con&s;ults a better guide&mdash;his own con&s;cience, informed by religion. And, indeed, the great difference between the good and the bad man con&s;i&s;ts in this: the good man will do nothing, but what his con&s;cience
<PB N="53" REF="47">
will allow: the bad man will do any thing, which the law cannot reach.</P>
<P>It would, indeed, be endle&s;s to de|&s;cribe the various ways, in which a man may be di&s;hone&s;t within the limits of law. They are as various, as our in|tercour&s;e with mankind. Some of the mo&s;t obvious of them I &s;hall cur&s;orily mention.</P>
<P>In matters of commerce the knave has many opportunities. The different qualities of the &s;ame commodity&mdash;the different modes of adulteration&mdash;the &s;pe|cious arts of vending&mdash;the frequent ig|norance in purcha&s;ing; and a variety of other circum&s;tances, open an endle&s;s field to the ingenuity of fraud. The hone&s;t fair-dealer, in the mean time, has only one rule, which is, that all arts, however common in bu&s;ine&s;s, which
<PB N="54" REF="48">
are intended to deceive, are utterly un|lawful. It may be added, upon this head, that if any one, con&s;cious of hav|ing been a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, is de&s;irous of re|pairing his fault, re&s;titution is by all means nece&s;&s;ary: till that be done, he continues in a cour&s;e of inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Again, in matters of contract, a man has many opportunities of being di&s;ho|ne&s;t within the bounds of law. He may be &s;trict in ob&s;erving the letter of an agreement, when the equitable meaning requires a laxer interpretation: or, he can take the laxer interpretation, when it &s;erves his purpo&s;e; and at the loop|hole of &s;ome ambiguous expre&s;&s;ion, ex|clude the literal meaning, though it be undoubtedly the true one.</P>
<P>The &s;ame iniquity appears in with|holding from another his ju&s;t right;
<PB N="55" REF="49">
or in putting him to expence, in re|covering it. The movements of the law are &s;low; and in many ca&s;es cannot be otherwi&s;e: but he who takes the ad|vantage of this to injure his neighbour, proves him&s;elf an undoubted knave.</P>
<P>It is a &s;pecies of the &s;ame kind of in|ju&s;tice to withhold a debt, when we have ability to pay; or to run into debt, when we have not that ability. The former can proceed only from a bad di&s;po&s;ition: the latter, from &s;uffering our de&s;ires to exceed our &s;tation. Some are excu&s;ed, on this head, as men of generous principles, which they cannot confine. But what is their genero&s;ity? They a&s;&s;i&s;t one man by injuring another. And what good ari&s;es to &s;ociety from hence? Such per&s;ons cannot act on principle; and we need not he&s;itate to rank them with tho&s;e, who run into
<PB N="56" REF="50">
debt to gratify their own &s;elfi&s;h inclina|tions. One man de&s;ires the elegancies of life; another de&s;ires what he thinks an equal good, the reputation of gene|ro&s;ity.</P>
<P>Oppre&s;&s;ion is another &s;pecies of in|ju&s;tice; by which, in a thou&s;and ways, under the cover of law, we may take the advantage of the &s;uperiority of our power, either to cru&s;h an inferior, or humble him to our de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Ingratitude is another. A loan, we know, claims a legal return. And is the obligation le&s;s, if, in&s;tead of a loan, you receive a kindne&s;s? The law, in|deed, &s;ays nothing on this point of im|morality; but an hone&s;t con&s;cience will be very loud in the condemnation of it.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="51">We may be unju&s;t al&s;o in our re&s;ent|ment; by carrying it beyond what rea|&s;on and religion pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>But it would be endle&s;s to de&s;cribe the various ways, in which inju&s;tice di&s;|covers it&s;elf. In truth, almo&s;t every omi&s;&s;ion of duty may be re&s;olved into inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The next precept is, "to bear no malice, nor hatred in our hearts."</P>
<P>The malice and hatred of our hearts ari&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, from injurious treatment; and &s;urely no man, when he is injured, can at fir&s;t help feeling that he is &s;o. But Chri&s;tianity requires, that we &s;hould &s;ubdue the&s;e feelings, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; "and not &s;uffer the &s;un to go down upon our wrath."Va|rious are the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, which
<PB N="58" REF="52">
inculcate the forgivene&s;s of injuries. In|deed, no point is more laboured than this; and with rea&s;on, becau&s;e no tem|per is more productive of evil, both to our&s;elves and others, than a malicious one. The &s;en&s;ations of a mind burning with revenge, are beyond de&s;cription: and as we are at the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons very un|able to judge coolly; and of cour&s;e, liable to carry our re&s;entment too far, the con&s;equence is, that, in our rage, we may do a thou&s;and things, which can never be atoned for; and of which we may repent as long as we live.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, one act draws on another; and retaliation keeps the quarrel alive. The go&s;pel, therefore, ever gracious, and kind to man, in all its precepts, injoins us to check all the&s;e violent emo|tions; and to leave our cau&s;e in the hands of God. "Vengeance is mine,
<PB N="59" REF="53">
I will repay, &s;aith the Lord:" and he, who, in oppo&s;ition to this precept, takes vengeance into his own hands, and che|ri&s;hes the malice and hatred of his heart, may a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf, that he has not yet learned to be a Chri&s;tian. The&s;e precepts, perhaps, may not entirely agree with modern principles of honour: but let the man of honour &s;ee to that. The maxims of the world cannot change the truth of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Nay, even in recovering our ju&s;t right, or in pur&s;uing a criminal to ju&s;|tice, we &s;hould take care, that it be not done in the &s;pirit of retaliation and re|venge. If the&s;e be our motives, though we make the law our in&s;trument, we are equally guilty.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides injurious treatment, the malice and hatred of our hearts
<PB N="60" REF="54">
have often another &s;ource, and that is envy: and thus in the litany, "envy, malice, and hatred," are all joined to|gether with great propriety. The emo|tions of envy are generally cooler, and le&s;s violent, than tho&s;e which ari&s;e from the re&s;entment of injury; &s;o that envy is &s;eldom &s;o mi&s;chievous in its effects as revenge: but with regard to our&s;elves, it is altogether as bad, and full as de|&s;tructive of the &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity. What is the religion of that man, who in&s;tead of thanking heaven for the ble&s;|&s;ings he receives, is fretting him&s;elf continually with a di&s;agreeable compa|ri&s;on between him&s;elf and &s;ome other? He cannot enjoy what he has, becau&s;e another has more wealth, a fairer fame, or perhaps more merit, than him&s;elf. He is mi&s;erable, becau&s;e others are happy.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="55">But to omit the wickedne&s;s of envy, how ab&s;urd and fooli&s;h is it, in a world where we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily expect much real mi&s;ery, to be perniciou&s;ly inventive in producing it?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, what ignorance! We &s;ee only the glaring out&s;ide of things. Un|der all that envied glare, many un&s;een di&s;tre&s;&s;es may lurk, from which our &s;tation may be free: for our merciful creator &s;eems to have be&s;towed happi|ne&s;s, as far as &s;tation is concerned, with great equality among all his creatures.</P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion, therefore, let it be the great object of our attention, and the &s;ubject of our prayers, to rid our minds of all this cur&s;ed intru&s;ion of evil thoughts&mdash;whether they proceed from malice, or from an envious temper. Let all our malicious thoughts &s;often
<PB N="62" REF="56">
into charity and benevolence; and let us "forgive one another, as God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, has forgiven us." As for our envious thoughts, as far as they re|late to externals, let them &s;ub&s;ide in humility, acquie&s;cence, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God. And when we are tempted to envy the good qualities of others, let us &s;purn &s;o ba&s;e a concep|tion, and change it into a generous e|mulation&mdash;into an endeavour to rai&s;e our&s;elves to an equality with our rival, not to depre&s;s him to a level with us.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Duties owing to our&s;elves&mdash;temperance &mdash;&s;obriety&mdash;cha&s;tity&mdash;rules for pre|&s;erving the purity of our thoughts, words, and actions.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="65" REF="58">THUS far the duties we have con|&s;idered, come mo&s;t properly un|der the head of tho&s;e which we owe to our neighbour; what follows, relates rather to our&s;elves. On this head, we are in&s;tructed "to keep our bodies in temperance, &s;oberne&s;s, and cha&s;tity."</P>
<P>Though our &s;ouls &s;hould be our great concern, yet, as they are nearly con|nected with our bodies, and as the im|purity of the one contaminates the other, a great degree of moral attention is, of cour&s;e, due to our bodies al&s;o.</P>
<P>As our fir&s;t &s;tation is in this world, to which our bodies particularly belong, they are formed with &s;uch appetites, as are requi&s;ite to our commodious liv|ing in it; and the rule given us is, "to u&s;e the world &s;o as not to abu&s;e it." St.
<PB N="66" REF="59">
Paul, by a beautiful allu&s;ion, calls our bodies the "temples of the Holy Gho&s;t:" by which he means to impre&s;s us with a &s;trong idea of their dignity; and to deter us from deba&s;ing by low plea&s;ures, what &s;hould be the &s;eat of &s;o much purity. To youth the&s;e cautions are above mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e their pa&s;&s;ions and appetites are &s;trong; their rea&s;on and judgement weak. They are prone to plea&s;ure, and void of re|flection. How, therefore, the&s;e young adventurers in life may be&s;t &s;teer their cour&s;e, and u&s;e this &s;inful world &s;o as not to abu&s;e it, is a con&s;ideration well worth their attention. Let us then &s;ee under what regulations their appetites &s;hould be re&s;trained.</P>
<P>By keeping our bodies in temperance is meant avoiding exce&s;s in eating, with regard both to the quantity and quality
<PB N="67" REF="60">
of our food. We &s;hould neither eat more than our &s;tomachs can well bear; nor be nice and delicate in our eating.</P>
<P>To pre&s;erve the body in health is the end of eating; and they who regulate them&s;elves merely by this end, who eat without choice or di&s;tinction, paying no regard to the plea&s;ure of eating, ob&s;erve perhaps the be&s;t rule of temperance. They go rather indeed beyond tempe|rance, and may be called ab&s;temious. A man may be temperate, and yet al|low him&s;elf a little more indulgence. Great care, however, is here nece&s;&s;ary; and the more, as perhaps no preci&s;e rule can be affixed, after we have pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t great limit, and let the palate loo&s;e among variety.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&mdash; Nam variae res,</L>

mu&s;t be our guide, which &s;hould be con&s;tantly kept awake by con&s;ider|ing the many bad con&s;equences, which attend a breach of temperance.&mdash;Young men, in the full vigour of health, do not con&s;ider the&s;e things; but as age comes on, and different maladies begin to appear, they may perhaps re|pent, they did not, a little earlier, practi&s;e the rules of temperance.</P>
<P>In a moral and religious light, the con&s;equences of intemperance are &s;till wor&s;e. To enjoy a comfortable meal, when it comes before us, is allowable: but he who &s;uffers his mind to dwell upon the plea&s;ures of eating, and makes
<PB N="69" REF="62">
them the employment of his thoughts, has at lea&s;t opened one &s;ource of mental corruption.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&mdash; Corpus onu&s;tum</L>

<P>After all, he who would mo&s;t per|fectly enjoy the plea&s;ures of the table, &s;uch as they are, mu&s;t look for them within the rules of temperance. The palate accu&s;tomed to &s;atiety hath lo&s;t its tone; and the greate&s;t &s;en&s;uali&s;ts have been brought to confe&s;s, that the coar&s;e&s;t fare, with an appetite kept in order by temperance, affords a more delicious repa&s;t, than the mo&s;t luxurious meal without it.</P>
<P>As temperance relates chiefly to eat|ing, &s;oberne&s;s or &s;obriety relates pro|perly

to drinking. And here the &s;ame ob&s;ervations recur. The &s;tricte&s;t, and perhaps the be&s;t rule, is merely to &s;a|tisfy the end of drinking. But if a little more indulgence be taken, it ought to be taken with the greate&s;t cir|cum&s;pection.</P>
<P>With regard to youth indeed, I &s;hould be inclined to great &s;trictne&s;s on this head. In eating, if they eat of pro|per and &s;imple food, they cannot ea&s;ily err. Their growing limbs, and &s;trong exerci&s;e, require larger &s;upplies than full-grown bodies, which mu&s;t be kept in order by a more rigid temperance. But if more indulgence be allowed them in eating, le&s;s, &s;urely, &s;hould in drink|ing. With &s;trong liquors of every kind they have nothing to do; and if they &s;hould totally ab&s;tain on this head, it were &s;o much the better. The languor

<BIBL>Hor. Sat.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> requires perhaps, now and then, &s;ome aids; but the &s;pi|rits of youth want no recruits: a little re&s;t is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>As to the bad con&s;equences derived from exce&s;&s;ive drinking, be&s;ides filling the blood with bloated and vicious hu|mours, and debauching the purity of the mind, as in the ca&s;e of intemperate eating, it is attended with this peculiar evil, the lo&s;s of our &s;en&s;es. Hence fol|low frequent inconveniences and morti|fications. We expo&s;e our follies&mdash;we betray our &s;ecrets&mdash;we are often impo|&s;ed upon&mdash;we quarrel with our friends &mdash;we lay our&s;elves open to our enemies; and, in &s;hort, make our&s;elves the ob|jects
<PB N="72" REF="65">
of contempt, and the topics of ri|dicule to all our acquaintance.&mdash;Nor is it only the act of intoxication which de|prives us of our rea&s;on during the pre|valence of it; the habit of drunkenne&s;s &s;oon be&s;ots and impairs the under&s;tand|ing, and renders us at all times le&s;s fit for the offices of life.</P>
<P>We are next injoined "to keep our bodies in cha&s;tity." "Flee youthful lu&s;ts," &s;ays the apo&s;tle, "which war a|gain&s;t the &s;oul." And there is &s;urely nothing which carries on a war again&s;t the &s;oul more &s;ucce&s;sfully. Wherever we have a catalogue in &s;cripture (and we have many &s;uch catalogues) of tho&s;e &s;ins, which in a peculiar manner de|bauch the mind, the&s;e youthful lu&s;ts have always, under &s;ome denomination, a place among them.&mdash;To keep our|&s;elves free from all contagion of this
<PB N="73" REF="66">
kind, let us endeavour to pre&s;erve a purity in our thoughts&mdash;our words&mdash; and our actions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, let us pre&s;erve a purity in our thoughts. The&s;e dark rece&s;&s;es, which the eye of the world cannot reach, are the receptacles of the&s;e youthful lu&s;ts. Here they find their fir&s;t encourage|ment. The entrance of &s;uch impure ideas perhaps we cannot always prevent. We may always however prevent che|ri&s;hing them: we may always prevent their making an impre&s;&s;ion upon us: the devil may be ca&s;t out, as &s;oon as di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Let us always keep in mind, that even into the&s;e dark abodes the eye of heaven can penetrate: that every thought of our hearts is open to that God, before whom we mu&s;t one day
<PB N="74" REF="67">
&s;tand; and that however &s;ecretly we may indulge the&s;e impure ideas, at the great day of account, they will certainly appear in an awful detail again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Let us remember again, that if our bodies be the temples of the Holy Gho&s;t, our minds are the very &s;anctua|ries of tho&s;e temples: and if there be any weight in the apo&s;tle's argument a|gain&s;t polluting our bodies, it urges with double force again&s;t polluting our minds.</P>
<P>But above all other con&s;iderations, it behoves us mo&s;t to keep our thoughts pure, becau&s;e they are the fountains from which our words and actions flow. "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth &s;peaketh." Ob&s;cene words and actions are only bad thoughts ma|tured; and &s;pring as naturally from
<PB N="75" REF="68">
them, as the plant from its &s;eed. It is the &s;ame vicious depravity carried a &s;tep farther; and only &s;hews a more confirmed, and a more mi&s;chievous de|gree of guilt. While we keep our im|purities in our thoughts, they debauch only our&s;elves: bad enough, it is true. But when we proceed to words and ac|tions, we let our impurities loo&s;e: we &s;pread the contagion, and become the corrupters of others.</P>
<P>Let it be our fir&s;t care, therefore, to keep our thoughts pure. If we do this, our words and actions will be pure of cour&s;e. And that we may be the bet|ter enabled to do it, let us u&s;e &s;uch helps as rea&s;on and religion pre&s;cribe. Let us avoid all company, and all books, that have a tendency to corrupt our minds; and every thing that can inflame our pa&s;&s;ions. He who allows
<PB N="76" REF="69">
him&s;elf in the&s;e things, holds a parley with vice; which will infallibly de|bauch him in the end, if he do not take the alarm in time, and break off &s;uch dalliance.</P>
<P>One thing ought to be our particular care, and that is, never to be unem|ployed. Ingenious amu&s;ements are of great u&s;e in filling up the vacuities of our time. Idle we &s;hould never be. A vacant mind is an invitation to vice.</P>

<P>Covetou&s;ne&s;s the &s;ource of wickedne&s;s and mi&s;ery&mdash;a de&s;iring frame of mind &mdash;covetou&s;ne&s;s con&s;i&s;tent with prodi|gality&mdash;particularly to be re&s;trained in youth&mdash;duties of each &s;tation&mdash; an active, u&s;eful life recommended&mdash; the proper motive to &s;uch a life.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="79" REF="71">WE are forbidden, next, "to co|vet, or de&s;ire other men's goods."</P>
<P>There are two great paths of vice, into which bad men commonly &s;trike; that of unlawful plea&s;ure, and that of unlawful gain.&mdash;The path of unlawful plea&s;ure we have ju&s;t examined; and have &s;een the danger of obeying the head&s;trong impul&s;e of our appetites.&mdash; We have con&s;idered al&s;o an immoderate love of gain, and have &s;een di&s;hone&s;ty and fraud in a variety of &s;hapes. But we have yet viewed them only as they relate to &s;ociety. We have viewed only the outward action. The rule before us, "We mu&s;t not covet, nor de&s;ire other men's goods," comes a &s;tep nearer home, and con&s;iders the motive which governs the action.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="72">Covetou&s;ne&s;s, or the love of money, is called in &s;cripture "the root of all evil:" and it is called &s;o for two rea|&s;ons; becau&s;e it makes us wicked, and becau&s;e it makes us mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it makes us wicked. When it once gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, it will let no good principle flouri&s;h near it. Mo&s;t vices have their fits; and when the violence of the pa&s;&s;ion is &s;pent, there is &s;ome interval of calm. The vicious appetite cannot always run riot. It is fatigued at lea&s;t by its own impetuo&s;ity: and it is po&s;&s;ible, that in this moment of tranquillity, a whi&s;per from virtue may be heard. But in ava|rice, there is rarely intermi&s;&s;ion. It hangs, like a dead weight upon the &s;oul, always pulling it to earth. We might as well expect to &s;ee a plant
<PB N="81" REF="73">
grow upon a flint, as a virtue in the heart of a mi&s;er.</P>
<P>It makes us mi&s;erable as well as wic|ked. The cares and the fears of ava|rice are proverbial; and it mu&s;t needs be that he, who depends for happine&s;s on what is liable to a thou&s;and acci|dents, mu&s;t of cour&s;e feel as many di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and almo&s;t as many di&s;ap|pointments. The good man depends for happine&s;s on &s;omething more per|manent; and if his worldly affairs go ill, his great dependance is &s;till left.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Saeviat, atq. novos moveat fortuna tumultus;</L>
<L>Quantum hinc imminuet?&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>Hor. Sat.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> But as wealth is the only god which the covetous man wor&s;hips, (for "covet|ou&s;ne&s;s," we are told, "is idolatry,") a di&s;appointment here, is a di&s;appoint|ment
<PB N="82" REF="74">
indeed. Be he ever &s;o pro&s;pe|rous, his wealth cannot &s;ecure him a|gain&s;t the evils of mortality; again&s;t that time, when he mu&s;t give up all he values; when his bargains of advantage will be over, and nothing left but tears and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>But even a de&s;iring frame of mind, tho it be not carried to &s;uch a length, is always productive of mi&s;ery. It can|not be otherwi&s;e. While we &s;uffer our|&s;elves to be continually in que&s;t of what we have not, it is impo&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould be happy with what we have. In a word, to abridge our wants as much as po&s;&s;ible, not to increa&s;e them, is the true&s;t happine&s;s.</P>
<P>We are much mi&s;taken, however, if we think the man who hoards up his money, is the only covetous man. The
<PB N="83" REF="75">
prodigal, though he differ in his end, may be as avaritious in his means.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Alieni appetens, &s;ui profu&s;us.</L>
<BIBL>Sal. de Catil.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> The former denies him&s;elf every comfort; the latter gra&s;ps at every plea&s;ure. Both characters are equally bad in different extremes. The mi&s;er is more dete&s;t|able in the eyes of the world, becau&s;e he enters into none of its joys; but it is a que&s;tion, which is more wretched in him&s;elf, or more pernicious to &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P>As covetou&s;ne&s;s is e&s;teemed the vice of age, every appearance of it among young per&s;ons ought particularly to be di&s;couraged; becau&s;e, if it gets ground at this early period, nobody can tell how far it may not afterwards proceed. And yet, on the other &s;ide, there may
<PB N="84" REF="76">
be great danger of encouraging the op|po&s;ite extreme. As it is certainly right, under proper re&s;trictions, both to &s;ave our money, and to &s;pend it, it would be highly u&s;eful to fix the due bounds on each &s;ide. But nothing is more difficult than to rai&s;e the&s;e nice limits between extremes. Every man's ca&s;e, in a thou&s;and circum&s;tances, differs from his neighbour's: and as no rule can be fixed for all; every man, of cour&s;e, in the&s;e di&s;qui&s;itions, mu&s;t be left to his own con&s;cience. We are all indeed very ready to give our opinions how others ought to act. We can adju&s;t with great nicety, what is proper for them to do; and point out their mi&s;takes with much preci&s;ion: while nothing is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to us, but to act as properly as as we can our&s;elves; ob&s;erving as ju&s;t a mean as po&s;&s;ible between prodigality and avarice; and applying, in all our
<PB N="85" REF="77">
difficulties, to the word of God, where the&s;e great land-marks of morality are the mo&s;t accurately fixed.</P>
<P>We have now taken a view of what is prohibited in our commerce with mankind: let us next &s;ee what is in|joined. (We are &s;till proceeding with tho&s;e duties, which we owe to our&s;elves.) In&s;tead of &s;pending our fortune there|fore in unlawful plea&s;ure, or increa&s;ing it by unlawful gain; we are required "to learn, and labour truly (that is ho|ne&s;tly) to get our own living, and to do our duty in that &s;tate of life, unto which it &s;hall plea&s;e God to call us."&mdash;The&s;e words will be &s;ufficiently explained by con&s;idering, fir&s;t, that we all have &s;ome &s;tation in life&mdash;&s;ome particular duties to di&s;charge; and &s;econdly, in what manner we ought to di&s;charge them.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="78">Fir&s;t, that man was not born to be idle, may be inferred from the active &s;pirit, that appears in every part of na|ture. Every thing is alive; every thing contributes to the general good: even the very inanimate parts of the creation, plants, &s;tones, metals, cannot be called totally inactive; but bear their part likewi&s;e in the general u&s;efulne&s;s. If then every part, even of inanimate na|ture, be thus employed, &s;urely we can|not &s;uppo&s;e it was the intention of the almighty father, that man, who is the mo&s;t capable of employing him&s;elf pro|perly, &s;hould be the only creature with|out employment.</P>
<P>Again, that man was born for active life, is plain from the nece&s;&s;ity of la|bour. If it had not been nece&s;&s;ary, God would not originally have impo&s;ed it. But without it, the body would become
<PB N="87" REF="79">
enervated, and the mind corrupted. Idle|ne&s;s therefore is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the ori|gin, both of di&s;ea&s;e and vice. So that if labour, and employment, either of body, or mind, had no u&s;e, but what re&s;pected our&s;elves, they would be highly proper: but they have farther u&s;e.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of them is plain, from the want that all men have of the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of others. If &s;o, this a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be mutual; every man &s;hould contribute his part. We have already &s;een, that it is proper, there &s;hould be different &s;tations in the world,&mdash;that &s;ome &s;hould be placed high in life, and others low. The lowe&s;t, we know, cannot be exempt from labour; and the highe&s;t ought not: though their labour, according to their &s;tation, will be of a different kind. Some, we &s;ee, "mu&s;t la|bour
<PB N="88" REF="80">
(as the catechi&s;m phra&s;es it) to get their own living; and others &s;hould do their duty in that &s;tate of life, whatever that &s;tate is, unto which it hath plea&s;ed God to call them." All are a&s;&s;i&s;ted: all &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t. God di&s;tributes, we read, various talents among men; to &s;ome he gives five talents, to others two, and to others one: but it is ex|pected, we find, that notwith&s;tanding this inequality, each &s;hould employ the talent that is given, to the be&s;t advan|tage: and he, who received five talents, was under the &s;ame obligation of im|proving them, as he who had received only one; and would, if he had hid his talents in the earth, have been puni&s;hed, in proportion to the abu&s;e. Every man, even in the highe&s;t &s;tation, may find a proper employment, both for his time and fortune, if he plea&s;e: and he may a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf, that God, by placing
<PB N="89" REF="81">
him in that &s;tation, never meant to ex|empt him from the common obligations of &s;ociety, and give him a licence to &s;pend his life in ea&s;e and plea&s;ure. God meant a&s;&s;uredly, that he &s;hould bear his part in the general commerce of life,&mdash; that he &s;hould con&s;ider him&s;elf not as an individual, but as a member of the com|munity; the intere&s;ts of which he is under an obligation to &s;upport, with all his power;&mdash;and that his elevated &s;ta|tion gives him no other pre-eminence, than that of being the more exten&s;ively u&s;eful.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;een, that we have all &s;ome &s;tation in life to &s;upport&mdash;&s;ome particular duties to di&s;charge; let us now &s;ee in what manner we ought to di&s;|charge them.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="82">We have an ea&s;y rule given us in &s;cripture, on this head; that all our duties in life &s;hould be performed "as to the Lord, and not unto man:" that is, we &s;hould con&s;ider our &s;tations in life, as tru&s;ts repo&s;ed in us by our maker; and as &s;uch &s;hould di&s;charge the duties of them. What, though no worldly tru&s;t be repo&s;ed? What, though we are accountable to nobody upon earth? Can we therefore &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves in reality le&s;s accountable? Can we &s;up|po&s;e, that God, for no rea&s;on that we can divine, has &s;ingled us out, and given us a large proportion of the things of this world, (while others around us are in need), for no other purpo&s;e than to &s;quander it away upon our&s;elves? To God undoubtedly we are accountable for every ble&s;&s;ing we enjoy. What mean, in &s;cripture, the talents given, and the
<PB N="91" REF="83">
u&s;e a&s;&s;igned; but the con&s;cientious di&s;|charge of the duties of life, according to the advantages, with which they are attended?</P>
<P>It matters not whether the&s;e advan|tages be an inheritance, or an acqui&s;i|tion: &s;till they are the gift of God. Agreeably to their rank in life, it is true, all men &s;hould live: human di|&s;tinctions require it; and in doing this properly, every one around will be be|nefited. Utility &s;hould be con&s;idered in all our expences. Even the very amu&s;ements of a man of fortune &s;hould be founded in it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it is the con&s;tant injunction of &s;cripture, in whatever &s;tation we are placed, to con&s;ider our&s;elves as God's &s;ervants; and as acting immediately under his eye; not expecting our reward
<PB N="92" REF="84">
among men; but from our great ma&s;ter who is in heaven. This &s;anctifies, in a manner, all our actions: it places the little difficulties of our &s;tation in the light of God's appointments; and turns the mo&s;t common duties of life into acts of religion.</P>

<P>Bad company&mdash;meaning of the phra&s;e&mdash; different cla&s;&s;es of bad company&mdash;ill-cho&s;en company&mdash;what is meant by keeping bad company&mdash;the danger of it from our aptne&s;s to imitate and catch the manners of others&mdash;from the great power and force of cu&s;tom &mdash;from our own bad inclinations.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="95" REF="86">WE have now gone through our duty to God, our neighbour, and our&s;elves; and &s;hould proceed, in the order pointed out in the catechi&s;m, to con&s;ider the lord's prayer: but it will not, perhaps, be ami&s;s to &s;tep a little a&s;ide, and but a little, for the &s;ake of one le&s;&s;on on a &s;ubject, which to youth is very important; and without the ob&s;ervance of which, every &s;tation will be attended with its peculiar dan|ger: the le&s;&s;on I mean re&s;pects the danger of keeping bad company.</P>
<P>"Evil communication, &s;ays the text, corrupts good manners." The a&s;&s;ertion is general: and no doubt all people &s;uffer from &s;uch communication; but above all, the minds of youth will &s;uf|fer; which are yet unformed, unprin|cipled,
<PB N="96" REF="87">
unfurni&s;hed; and ready to re|ceive any impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But before we con&s;ider the danger of keeping bad company, let us fir&s;t &s;ee the meaning of the phra&s;e.</P>
<P>In the phra&s;e of the world, good company means fa&s;hionable people. Their &s;tations in life, not their morals are con&s;idered: and he, who a&s;&s;ociates with &s;uch, though they &s;et him the ex|ample of breaking every commandment of the decalogue, is &s;till &s;aid to keep good company.&mdash;I &s;hould wi&s;h you to fix another meaning to the expre&s;&s;ion; and to con&s;ider vice in the &s;ame dete&s;ta|ble light, in whatever company it is found; nay, to con&s;ider all company in which it is found, be their &s;tation what it will, as bad company.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="88">The three following cla&s;&s;es will per|haps include the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e, who de&s;erve this appellation.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t, I &s;hould rank all who endeavour to de&s;troy the principles of chri&s;tianity&mdash;who je&s;t upon &s;cripture&mdash; talk bla&s;phemy&mdash;and treat revelation with contempt.</P>
<P>A &s;econd cla&s;s of bad company are tho&s;e, who have a tendency to de&s;troy in us the principles of common hone&s;ty and integrity. Under this head, we may rank game&s;ters of every denomina|tion; and the low, and infamous cha|racters of every profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A third cla&s;s of bad company, and &s;uch as are commonly mo&s;t dangerous to youth, includes the long catalogue of men of plea&s;ure. In whatever way
<PB N="98" REF="89">
they follow the call of appetite, they have equally a tendency to corrupt the purity of the mind.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e three cla&s;&s;es, whom we may call bad company, there are others who come under the denomination of ill-cho&s;en company: trifling, in&s;ipid cha|racters of every kind; who follow no bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;are led by no ideas of im|provement&mdash;but &s;pend their time in di&s;&s;ipation and folly&mdash;who&s;e highe&s;t prai&s;e it is, that they are only not vi|cious.&mdash;With none of the&s;e, a &s;erious man would wi&s;h his &s;on to keep com|pany.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked what is meant by keep|ing bad company? The world abounds with characters of this kind: they meet us in every place; and if we keep com|pany
<PB N="99" REF="90">
at all, it is impo&s;&s;ible to avoid keeping company with &s;uch per&s;ons.</P>
<P>It is true, if we were determined never to have any commerce with bad men, we mu&s;t, as the apo&s;tle remarks, "altogether go out of the world." By keeping bad company, therefore is not meant a ca&s;ual intercour&s;e with them, on occa&s;ion of bu&s;ine&s;s; or as they acci|dentally fall in our way; but having an inclination to con&s;ort with them&mdash;com|plying with that inclination&mdash;&s;eeking their company, when we might avoid it&mdash;entering into their parties&mdash;and mak|ing them the companions of our choice. Mixing with them occa&s;ionally, cannot be avoided.</P>
<P>The danger of keeping bad company, ari&s;es principally from our aptne&s;s to imitate and catch the manners and &s;en|timents
<PB N="100" REF="91">
of others&mdash;from the power of cu&s;tom&mdash;from our own bad inclinations &mdash;and from the pains taken by the bad to corrupt us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this &s;ubject treated more at large in an anony|mous pamphlet, on the employment of time.</NOTE></P>
<P>In our earlie&s;t youth, the contagion of manners is ob&s;ervable. In the boy, yet incapable of having any thing in&s;tilled into him, we ea&s;ily di&s;cover from his fir&s;t actions, and rude attempts at language, the kind of per&s;ons, with whom he has been brought up: we &s;ee the early &s;pring of a civilized education; or the fir&s;t wild &s;hoots of ru&s;ticity.</P>
<P>As he enters farther into life, his be|haviour, manners, and conver&s;ation, all take their ca&s;t from the company he keeps. Ob&s;erve the pea&s;ant, and the man of education; the difference is
<PB N="101" REF="92">
&s;triking. And yet God hath be&s;towed equal talents on each. The only diffe|rence is, they have been thrown into different &s;cenes of life; and have had commerce with per&s;ons of different &s;tations.</P>
<P>Nor are manners and behaviour more ea&s;ily caught; than opinions, and prin|ciples. In childhood and youth, we naturally adopt the &s;entiments of tho&s;e about us. And as we advance in life, how few of us think for our&s;elves? How many of us are &s;atisfied with tak|ing our opinions at &s;econd hand?</P>
<P>The great power, and force of cu&s;tom forms another argument again&s;t keeping bad company. However &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;|po&s;ed we may be; and however &s;hocked at the fir&s;t approaches of vice; this &s;hocking appearance goes off, upon an
<PB N="102" REF="93">
intimacy with it. Cu&s;tom will &s;oon render the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tful thing fami|liar. And this is indeed a kind provi|&s;ion of nature, to render labour, and toil, and danger, which are the lot of man, more ea&s;y to him. The raw &s;ol|dier, who trembles at the fir&s;t encoun|ter, becomes a hardy veteran in a few campaigns. Habit renders danger fa|miliar, and of cour&s;e indifferent to him.</P>
<P>But habit, which is intended for our good, may, like other kind appoint|ments of nature, be converted into a mi&s;chief. The well-di&s;po&s;ed youth, en|tering fir&s;t into bad company, is &s;hocked at what he hears, and what he &s;ees. The good principles, which he had im|bibed, ring in his ears an alarming le&s;&s;on again&s;t the wickedne&s;s of his com|panions. But, alas! this &s;en&s;ibility is but of a day's continuance.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Ridicule one of the chief arts of cor|ruption&mdash;bad company injures our characters, as well as manners&mdash;pre|&s;umption the forerunner of ruin&mdash; the advantages of good company e|qual to the di&s;advantages of bad&mdash; cautions in forming intimacies.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="107" REF="97">THESE arguments again&s;t keeping bad company, will &s;till receive additional &s;trength; if we con&s;ider far|ther, the great pains taken by the bad to corrupt others. It is a very true, but lamentable fact, in the hi&s;tory of human nature, that bad men take more pains to corrupt their own &s;pecies, than virtuous men do to reform them. Hence tho&s;e &s;pecious arts, that &s;how of friend|&s;hip, that appearance of di&s;intere&s;tne&s;s, with which the profligate &s;educer en|deavours to lure the unwary youth; and at the &s;ame time, yielding to his incli|nations, &s;eems to follow rather than to lead him. Many are the arts of the&s;e corrupters; but their principal art is ridicule. By this they endeavour to laugh out of countenance all the better principles of their wavering pro&s;elyte; and make him think contemptibly of
<PB N="108" REF="98">
tho&s;e, whom he formerly re&s;pected: by this they &s;tifle the ingenuous blu&s;h; and finally de&s;troy all &s;en&s;e of &s;hame. Their cau&s;e is below argument. They aim not therefore at rea&s;oning. Raillery is the weapon they employ; and who is there, that hath the &s;teadine&s;s to hear per&s;ons and things, whatever reverence he may have had for them, the &s;ubject of continual ridicule, without lo&s;ing that reverence by degrees?</P>
<P>Having thus con&s;idered what prin|cipally makes bad company dangerous, I &s;hall ju&s;t add, that even were your morals in no danger from &s;uch inter|cour&s;e, your characters would infallibly &s;uffer. The world will always judge of you by your companions: and no|body will &s;uppo&s;e, that a youth of virtuous principles him&s;elf, can po&s;&s;ibly form a connection with a profligate.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="99">In reply to the danger &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from bad company, perhaps the youth may &s;ay, he is &s;o firm in his own opinions, &s;o &s;teady in his principles, that he thinks him&s;elf &s;ecure; and need not re&s;train him&s;elf from the mo&s;t un|re&s;erved conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Alas! this &s;ecurity is the very brink of the precipice: nor hath vice in her whole train a more dangerous enemy to you, than pre&s;umption. Caution, ever awake to danger, is a guard again&s;t it. But &s;ecurity lays every guard a&s;leep. "Let him who thinketh, he &s;tandeth," &s;aith the apo&s;tle, "take heed, le&s;t he fall." Even an apo&s;tle him&s;elf did fall, by thinking, that he &s;tood &s;ecure. "Though I &s;hould die with thee," &s;aid St. Peter to his ma&s;ter, "yet will I not deny thee." That very night, notwith|&s;tanding this boa&s;ted &s;ecurity, he re|peated
<PB N="110" REF="100">
the crime three &s;everal times. And can we &s;uppo&s;e, that pre&s;umption, which occa&s;ioned an apo&s;tle's fall, &s;hall not ruin an unexperienced youth? The &s;tory is recorded for our in&s;truction; and &s;hould be a &s;tanding le&s;&s;on again&s;t pre&s;uming upon our own &s;trength.</P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion, &s;uch as the dangers are, which ari&s;e from bad company, &s;uch are the advantages, which accrue from good. We imitate, and catch the manners, and &s;entiments of good men, as we do of bad. Cu&s;tom, which ren|ders vice le&s;s a deformity, renders vir|tue more lovely. Good examples have a force beyond in&s;truction, and warm us into emulation beyond precept: while the countenance and conver&s;ation of virtuous men encourage, and draw out into action every kindred di&s;po&s;ition of our hearts.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="101">Be&s;ides, as a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame often prevents our doing a right thing in bad company; it operates in the &s;ame way in preventing our doing a wrong one in good. Our character becomes a pledge; and we cannot, without a kind of di&s;|honour, draw back.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible, indeed, for a youth, yet unfurni&s;hed with knowledge, (which fits him for good company) to chu&s;e his companions as he plea&s;es. A youth mu&s;t have &s;omething peculiarly attrac|tive, to qualify him for the acquain|tance of men of e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation. What he has to do, is, at all events, to avoid bad company; and to endea|vour, by improving his mind and mo|rals, to qualify him&s;elf for the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Happy is that youth, who, upon his entrance into the world, can chu&s;e
<PB N="112" REF="102">
his company with di&s;cretion. There is often in vice, a gayety, an unre&s;erve, a freedom of manners, which are apt at &s;ight to engage the unwary: while vir|tue, on the other hand, is often mode&s;t, re&s;erved, diffident, backward, and ea&s;ily di&s;concerted. That freedom of man|ners, however engaging, may cover a very corrupt heart: and this awkward|ne&s;s, however unplea&s;ing, may veil a thou&s;and virtues. Suffer not your mind therefore, to be ea&s;ily either engaged, or di&s;gu&s;ted at fir&s;t &s;ight. Form your inti|macies with re&s;erve: and if drawn un|awares into an acquaintance you di&s;ap|prove, immediately retreat. Open not your hearts to every profe&s;&s;ion of friend|&s;hip. They, who&s;e friend&s;hip is worth accepting, are, as you ought to be, re&s;erved in offering it. Chu&s;e your companions, not merely for the &s;ake of a few outward accompli&s;hments&mdash;for
<PB N="113" REF="103">
the idle plea&s;ure of &s;pending an agree|able hour; but mark their di&s;po&s;ition to virtue or vice; and, as much as po&s;|&s;ible, chu&s;e tho&s;e for your companions, whom you &s;ee others re&s;pect: always re|membering, that upon the choice of your company depends in a great mea|&s;ure, the &s;ucce&s;s of all you have learned; the hopes of your friends; your future characters in life; and, what you ought above all other things to value, the pu|rity of your hearts.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="117" REF="105">BEFORE we enter upon the lord's prayer, which falls next under our examination, it may be proper to con|&s;ider prayer in general&mdash;the object, the advantages, and the qualifications of it; together with &s;ome of the mo&s;t popular objections, which are made to it.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the infinite di&s;tance between God and man&mdash;between that being, whom the heaven of heavens can|not contain; and man, with all the weakne&s;&s;es of mortality about him; it may at fir&s;t appear matter of a&s;toni&s;h|ment, that we are allowed any commu|nication with &s;o great a being. The di&s;tinctions, which worldly policy, and worldly pride, make among mankind, &mdash;among creatures of the &s;ame rank, cannot but rai&s;e our ideas &s;till higher of the goodne&s;s of God! When we &s;ee
<PB N="118" REF="106">
man treating his fellow-creatures with petulance, and di&s;dain, upon the vile di&s;tinctions of &s;tation, family, and for|tune; what a le&s;&s;on to us is the good|ne&s;s of God! Merciful, mild, and conde&s;cending to our weakne&s;&s;es, he li&s;tens to, and grants, the petitions of his meane&s;t creatures.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t great object of prayer is the prai&s;e of God. The works of crea|tion naturally rai&s;e it: and the good|ne&s;s of God, in continuing to us that being, which we cannot our&s;elves pre|&s;erve; and the comforts which we can|not our&s;elves procure; brings it home to our feelings. It is a duty, which every rational creature owes to his crea|tor. It is al&s;o one of the be&s;t &s;ources of our happine&s;s. Simple prai&s;e, which con&s;i&s;ts merely in extolling excellence, is a plea&s;ing theme. But when it is
<PB N="119" REF="107">
excited by gratitude, it flows with &s;till greater plea&s;ure. Gratitude has a ten|dency to improve that happy di&s;po&s;ition of mind, which feels every enjoyment that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>A &s;econd object of prayer is, to &s;o|licit the pardon of our &s;ins. God not only permits, but even injoins us to to do it: and he has appointed penitent prayer, as one of the means of obtaining pardon. It mu&s;t ever be accompanied by confe&s;&s;ion; as confe&s;&s;ing a fault is one of the fir&s;t &s;teps towards amending it. In this humiliating employment, we have not only to deplore our own &s;infulne&s;s; but the lo&s;t condition of human nature. Without being truly &s;en&s;ible of this, we can neither acknow|ledge the means, which God hath u&s;ed to obviate it; nor be grateful for them.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="108">After thanking God for his pa&s;t goodne&s;s, and endeavouring to make our&s;elves as worthy as we can of fu|ture favours; it is the next object of prayer, to petition a &s;upply of our wants. Among them the principal is, that of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's holy &s;pi|rit. It is the con&s;tant doctrine of &s;crip|ture, that, however nece&s;&s;ary our own endeavours are, to make us virtuous; they are not &s;ufficient alone to do it. Our own feelings and imperfections, in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, mu&s;t convince us that this is the ca&s;e. To counteract the depravity of nature, God hath pro|mi&s;ed us the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his holy &s;pirit: and earne&s;t prayer is the means he hath appointed for the attain|ment of that end. We are permitted al&s;o to pray for our temporal wants. This is indeed the nice&s;t and mo&s;t de|licate part of prayer. Too thankful
<PB N="121" REF="109">
for pa&s;t mercies we cannot be: too earne&s;t in &s;oliciting the pardon of our &s;ins, and God's &s;piritual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we cannot be: but &s;o &s;hort &s;ighted are we, that in begging a &s;upply of our temporal wants, we may ea&s;ily err. But on the&s;e heads, I &s;hall be more full, in the explanation of the Lord's prayer.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides prai&s;ing God for his mercies; a&s;king pardon for our &s;ins; and beg|ing a &s;upply of our wants, which are the primary objects of prayer; there are other great advantages, which are clo&s;ely connected with it.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e the fir&s;t, is to pre&s;erve in our minds a &s;en&s;e of God, and of our de|pendence upon him. When we prai&s;e God, we are naturally impre&s;&s;ed with an idea of his perfections; and when we beg the forgivene&s;s of our &s;ins, and a
<PB N="122" REF="110">
&s;upply of our wants; we are as naturally reminded, that we are weak and &s;inful creatures: that we are continually un|der the eye of an all-powerful Being; and are in hourly need of his protection, and favour. And if our prayers be con&s;tant, uniform, and fervent; the&s;e great truths will be impre&s;&s;ed upon our minds, and become the leading princi|ples of our lives.</P>
<P>Prayer is calculated al&s;o to impre&s;s us with a &s;en&s;e of our duty; and to keep us &s;teady in the practice of it. A virtuous wi&s;h is a &s;tep towards virtue. A fervent prayer is &s;till a nearer ad|vance. To pray ardently for an in|crea&s;e of virtue, even in a natural way, mu&s;t increa&s;e it: and to pray frequently, mu&s;t tend to pre&s;erve it. Indeed, in the whole circle of chri&s;tian duties, perhaps there is not one, which has a
<PB N="123" REF="111">
greater effect in forming the heart, than rational devotion.</P>
<P>After the advantages of prayer, let us con&s;ider the qualifications of it: or, what concomitant circum&s;tances are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make it an acceptable &s;ervice to God. It &s;hould be founded in faith; and accompanied with humility, &s;in|cerity, re&s;olutions of amendment, and charity. It &s;hould al&s;o be offered up in the name, and through the merits of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It &s;hould fir&s;t be founded in faith. It is obvious to common &s;en&s;e, that "he who cometh to God, mu&s;t believe that he is; and that he is a rewarder of them, who diligently &s;eek him:" other|wi&s;e, why &s;hould we come to him at all? We ought therefore to tru&s;t his promi&s;es, and put up our prayers in the
<PB N="124" REF="112">
full a&s;&s;urance of being heard. Even men, when their word is plighted, expect this confidence. And &s;hall we ap|proach God with le&s;s confidence, than we do man?</P>
<P>Secondly, our prayers mu&s;t be ac|companied with humility. Humility is expected, even when we a&s;k a favour of our fellow-creatures. What humi|liation then is due to God, from whom we have every thing to a&s;k; and be|fore whom we have not the &s;malle&s;t merits to plead? An humble heart is in it&s;elf a plea&s;ing &s;acrifice to God. The humility of the publican was half his prayer.</P>
<P>They &s;hould be accompanied al&s;o with &s;incerity. Mere lip-&s;ervice can never plea&s;e God. It is a mockery of him. Indeed, if our minds are thorough|ly
<PB N="125" REF="113">
impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of God's pow|er and goodne&s;s; and of our own weak|ne&s;s and dependence; our prayers will of cour&s;e be &s;incere: we &s;hall find it le&s;s difficult to check the idle wander|ings of our thoughts: we &s;hall confe&s;s our &s;ins with an heartfelt contrition; and prai&s;e God with unfeigned thank|fulne&s;s. I &s;hall ju&s;t add, that as we &s;hould guard, on one hand, again&s;t an unanimate coldne&s;s, and in&s;en&s;ibility; &s;o ought we, on the other, to avoid all irrational fervour, in our devotions. The effu&s;ions of a heated imagination, cannot be a plea&s;ing &s;acrifice to an all-wi&s;e God.</P>
<P>But &s;incere prayer is of little value in the &s;ight of God, if it be not accom|panied with &s;teady re&s;olutions of a|mendment. If the heart be not im|proved, devotion is dead. Its fruit is
<PB N="126" REF="114">
lo&s;t. To implore pardon for our &s;ins, and not endeavour to avoid them; is &s;hewing our&s;elves to be ju&s;t &s;o much in earne&s;t, as to own we are in the wrong; without attempting to get right.</P>
<P>One thing more is nece&s;&s;ary to make our devotions acceptable to God; they &s;hould be offered up in the &s;pirit of charity. He who begs forgivene&s;s at God's hands, in an unforgiving temper, may as well omit his prayers. He had better omit them. To his uncharitable temper, he only adds a new offence&mdash; that of an unworthy prayer. It is the con&s;tant language of &s;cripture, that "with the &s;ame mea&s;ure with which we mete, it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to us again. Give, and it &s;hall be given unto you. Forgive, and ye &s;hall be forgiven."</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="115">But no human qualifications alone can carry up our prayers to the throne of grace. We mu&s;t have other merits, be&s;ides our own, to make them accep|table in the &s;ight of God&mdash;the all-&s;uffi|cient merits of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer. He is the great mediator between God and man. A holy life makes his me|rits, ours. All our prayers therefore &s;hould be offered up in his name, and through his mo&s;t powerful mediation.</P>
<P>But in the Lord's prayer, no mention is made of the merits of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It is true; nor could there. When that prayer was compo&s;ed, the great atonement was not made. How could it then be pleaded? But we are told, it ought to be pleaded, as &s;oon as it was made. "Hitherto," &s;aid our Saviour to his di&s;ciples, a little before his pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="128" REF="116">
"have ye a&s;ked nothing in my name: but what&s;oever you &s;hall a&s;k the Father in my name, he will give it you."</P>
<P>When all the&s;e qualifications are u|nited; when our prayers are founded in faith&mdash;when they are accompanied with humility, &s;incerity, re&s;olutions of amendment, and charity&mdash;and la&s;tly, when they are offered up in the name, and through the merits of Chri&s;t; we may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that they will be acceptable in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>I &s;hall ju&s;t add, on this &s;ubject, that be&s;ides formal prayers, either public or private, a devout mind will find many opportunities of exerci&s;ing it&s;elf, in the mid&s;t even of bu&s;ine&s;s and plea&s;ure. An ejaculation of prai&s;e, a &s;ingle petition, rai&s;ed from the heart, in one devout thought, unaccompanied by any exter|nal
<PB N="129" REF="117">
act, will unque&s;tionably find its way to heaven. This is literally having God in all our thoughts; and making our lives a continual prayer.</P>
<P>As rea&s;onable a duty, however, as prayer is, objections have been made to it.</P>
<P>Prai&s;e, it hath been &s;aid, is an ab&s;urd homage: as if the Almighty Father could be plea&s;ed with the empty prai&s;es of a poor in&s;ignificant race of creatures. We are to do all, it &s;eems, to the glory of God. What glory can God receive from our doings? Doth his name in any re&s;pect depend upon the breath of man?</P>
<P>To this objection we an&s;wer, that if the real exaltation of God's glory, or if any addition to his happine&s;s, be &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="130" REF="118">
to be the intention of prai&s;e; the idea indeed were very ab&s;urd. But certainly with regard to man; no em|ployment can be more adapted to his nature, or in it&s;elf more rational, than to prai&s;e his creator. It reminds him of all tho&s;e great attributes, which, as he prai&s;es them, he learns to imitate. It reminds him of that infinite wi&s;dom and power, on which he ought always to depend. It reminds him of that ten|derne&s;s, and indulgence, which he has &s;o often experienced, and which he ought ever to prai&s;e.</P>
<P>When we are ordered therefore to do every thing for the glory of God, the expre&s;&s;ion is merely adapted to common acceptation; and alludes to the glory of earthly princes, which good &s;ubjects advance by obeying the laws. The highe&s;t glory therefore, according to
<PB N="131" REF="119">
our ideas, which God can receive from his creatures, ari&s;es from their obe|dience to his commands.</P>
<P>But it is ab&s;urd, replies the objector, to inform God of our wants: nay &s;uch information amounts almo&s;t to a denial of his omni&s;cience.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly, if it were the intention of the petitioner to inform God; but this never enters into the idea of a prayer. God hath injoined us to pray for a &s;upply of our wants, as a mean of receiving it. In what manner prayer is efficacious to this purpo&s;e, it is not for us to inquire. One thing is very ob|vious, that dependant creatures ought always to be reminded of their depend|ent &s;tate; and of that Being, from who&s;e bounty they receive every thing they enjoy. And nothing &s;urely can
<PB N="132" REF="120">
be better calculated than prayer, to pro|mote this wi&s;e end.</P>
<P>But is not prayer an ab&s;urd attempt to alter the &s;tated cour&s;e of things? And is it not high pre&s;umption to ima|gine, that God will alter it for the &s;ake of our petitions?</P>
<P>The objection is founded in igno|rance. Do we know what is the &s;tated cour&s;e of things? Do we know whe|ther there even exi&s;ts what the objector calls a &s;tated cour&s;e? Or whether God may not re&s;erve all events, as far as free agents are concerned, in a mutable con|dition, dependant on circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>In whatever way our prayers are ef|ficacious, it is not our part to inquire. We have the Almighty's expre&s;s com|mand for this intercour&s;e with him; and
<PB N="133" REF="121">
therefore we ought with thankfulne&s;s to comply. He who gave the command, knows be&s;t how to make the compliance with it effectual.</P>

<P>Occa&s;ion on which the Lord's prayer was compo&s;ed&mdash;general idea of it&mdash; divi&s;ion into five parts&mdash;the fir&s;t con|tains an addre&s;s of prai&s;e&mdash;explana|tion of the word Father, when ap|plied to God&mdash;of the word heaven&mdash; The &s;econd part contains a petition for the general good of mankind&mdash; meaning of hallowing God's name&mdash; thy kingdom come&mdash;thy will be done.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="137" REF="123">HAVING thus con&s;idered prayer in general, let us now con&s;ider the Lord's prayer.</P>
<P>This prayer was compo&s;ed by our Saviour, upon a reque&s;t which his di&s;|ciples made him; to "teach them to pray, as John taught his di&s;ciples." Much of the &s;ub&s;tance of it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been taken from the Jewi&s;h forms, then in u&s;e; from which our Saviour, as it appears, &s;electing proper parts, adapted them to his own pur|po&s;e. This mode of compo&s;ing a prayer was agreeable to his u&s;ual practice; which was to give as little offence as po&s;&s;ible to the prejudices of men. In forming a prayer, therefore, he cho&s;e rather to take in part what he found already e&s;tabli&s;hed, than to compo&s;e one entirely anew.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="124">This prayer was not only intended as a form of prayer in it&s;elf, but al&s;o as a model to &s;hew us how to fa&s;hion our prayers. We have the great lines of rational devotion marked out; to which we may adapt our own exigencies. This &s;eems implied in the introduction; "After this manner pray ye." As if our Saviour had &s;aid, The preci&s;e form of words here given you, needs not al|ways be adhered to: but let it be your general direction.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t part contains an invocation of prai&s;e. "Our father which art in heaven."</P>
<P>The Jews, as far as appears, were not allowed the u&s;e of this addre&s;s to God. At lea&s;t they had no idea of it in a chri&s;|tian &s;en&s;e. They were taught rather to addre&s;s him by &s;ome &s;uch awful title, as the "lord Jehovah&mdash;the lord of ho&s;ts&mdash;or the lord who taketh venge|ance." His power, rather than his good|ne&s;s, was the leading character under which they acknowledged him. But the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation allows us to addre&s;s the deity under the tender name of father. "We have received the &s;pi|rit of adoption, whereby we cry abba, father. The &s;pirit it&s;elf beareth witne&s;s
<PB N="141" REF="127">
with our &s;pirit, that we are the children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chri&s;t." Under the gracious appella|tion of father, we not only acknowledge God as the creator, and pre&s;erver of the world; but hope from him, as a child expects from his parent, the &s;upply of our wants, a&s;&s;i&s;tance in our difficulties, indulgence to our failings, and pardon for our faults: and the&s;e kindne&s;&s;es in a greater degree, proportioned to his greater goodne&s;s, and power.</P>
<P>By the word heaven, the Jewi&s;h lan|guage frequently under&s;tands pre-emi|nence. A city exalted to heaven, means only a city rai&s;ed to an extraordinary height of power. When we addre&s;s God therefore in heaven, we are not taught to conceive him as &s;tationed in any par|ticular place of abode: God is pre&s;ent,
<PB N="142" REF="128">
we know, on earth, as well as in heaven; every where, as well as any where. When we addre&s;s our&s;elves therefore to God in heaven, we mean only to addre&s;s our&s;elves to that God, who is omnipo|tent, and &s;upreme.</P>

<P>After the invocation, the prayer be|gins, in the &s;pirit of chri&s;tian benevo|lence, with a petition for the general good of mankind: "Hallowed be thy name&mdash;thy kingdom come&mdash;thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven."</P>
<P>God's name is hallowed, or religiou&s;ly honoured, when his creatures have ju&s;t &s;entiments of him. When we pray therefore, that God's name may be hal|lowed; we pray, that mankind may have their minds impre&s;&s;ed with ju&s;t ideas of
<PB N="143" REF="129">
his wi&s;dom, power, ju&s;tice, and other attributes. In a word, we pray, that all mankind may love, and fear him, as their great benefactor, and judge,&mdash;and that, in the &s;cripture language, "they may &s;anctify the Lord God in their hearts."</P>
<P>We farther pray, that mankind may not only have ju&s;t &s;entiments of the deity; but may be partakers al&s;o with us in the purity of religion. "Thy kingdom come."</P>
<P>By kingdom, in the new te&s;tament, or the "kingdom of heaven," is gene|rally meant the chri&s;tian religion. When John the bapti&s;t preached, &s;aying, "the kingdom of heaven is at hand;" he meant the go&s;pel, or the chri&s;tian reli|gion, is about to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. When we pray, therefore, that "God's king|dom
<PB N="144" REF="130">
may come;" we pray, that the chri&s;tian religion, in its full purity and perfection, may be e&s;tabli&s;hed through|out the world; as what mu&s;t be mo&s;t conducive to the happine&s;s of it. This is yet, we &s;ee, far from being the ca&s;e. Great part of the world never heard of chri&s;tianity. Great part of it, though they have heard of Chri&s;t, yet acknow|ledge him not. A large portion even of the chri&s;tian world deba&s;e chri&s;tianity almo&s;t into heatheni&s;m: and great num|bers, even where we &s;uppo&s;e chri&s;tianity purely profe&s;&s;ed, deny the power of it, by leading wicked lives. Great rea&s;on therefore have we to pray, that God's "kingdom may come."&mdash;We have ground to hope, from many parts of the prophetic writings, that at length "the fulne&s;s of the gentiles &s;hall come in." And for this event we devoutly pray; "when the day &s;tar &s;hall ari&s;e to all the
<PB N="145" REF="131">
world; and the people, which &s;it in darkne&s;s, &s;hall &s;ee a great light:" when the whole race of mankind &s;hall join in the p&s;almi&s;t's triumphant &s;ong, "the Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice: yea the multitude of the i&s;les &s;hall be glad thereof."</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of men's having ju&s;t notions of God, and a true religion to direct them; we pray, that their lives may be an&s;werable to &s;uch advantages; and that God may be obeyed by man|kind on earth, as far as human frailty will permit, as he is by the angels in heaven: "Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven."&mdash;Angelic obedience we conceive to be perfect: human obe|dience, we know, is very defective.

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER praying for the general good of mankind; we are in|&s;tructed to pray for the &s;upply of our own wants. The&s;e are of two kinds, temporal and &s;piritual.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, we are allowed to pray for temporal things. "Give us this day our daily bread," is all we are allowed: and it cannot po&s;&s;ibly, by any mode of inter|pretation, extend to more, than the nece&s;|&s;aries of life. It is a common analogy in language, to make &s;ome principal thing &s;tand for many of the &s;ame kind. Thus the word faith often &s;tands for the whole of religion; tho it is only a part. And thus the word bread, in the pa&s;|&s;age before us, &s;tands for all the nece&s;|&s;aries of life; of which it is the princi|pal. For the nece&s;&s;aries of life then we
<PB N="150" REF="135">
are allowed to pray; but not for the &s;uperfluities of it. We mu&s;t pray in general terms; but mu&s;t not particula|rize. For &s;piritual things, we are at full liberty; becau&s;e here we cannot err: but with regard to temporal, &s;o circum&s;cribed is all our knowledge, that if we go farther, we may run into error; and in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, ask for things, which may prove our ruin. The apo&s;tle warns us again&s;t tho&s;e, "who a&s;k ami&s;s, that they may con&s;ume it upon their lu&s;ts."</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;ingular in the repetition of the words, this day, and daily; as if human nature, &s;o apt to err on this &s;ubject, were doubly cautioned not to be &s;olicitous to lay up a great &s;tore for the future: but, to be &s;ati&s;|fied with a moderate provi&s;ion; and that we &s;hould not &s;eem to form in our

hearts, that wicked wi&s;h of placing our|&s;elves in a &s;tate independent of God. "Thou fool, this night &s;hall thy &s;oul be required of thee;" is a dreadful &s;en|tence upon record again&s;t &s;uch folly.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART IV.</HEAD>
<P>Being permitted, with the&s;e re&s;trictons, to pray for temporal things; we are al|lowed a larger &s;cope with regard to &s;pi|ritual. On this head, we have two things to pray for&mdash;that God would pardon our pa&s;t &s;ins; and a&s;&s;i&s;t us in avoiding &s;in for the future. Both the&s;e reque&s;ts are contained in the following words: "Forgive us our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as we forgive them that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="137">Fir&s;t then, we are to beg of God for|givene&s;s of our pa&s;t &s;ins; and a chri&s;|tian knows, upon what conditions only they will be forgiven. Without a tho|rough repentance of them&mdash;&s;uch a re|pentance, as ends in a reformed life, we know, it is in vain to expect forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>Something more al&s;o is required. We are in&s;tructed to approach the throne of God in a forgiving temper towards o|thers; when we petition forgivene&s;s for our&s;elves: agreeably to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, in which we are told, "that unle&s;s we forgive others, our heavenly father will not forgive us;" and that, "when we come to the altar, and there remember that we are at en|mity with our neighbour; we mu&s;t fir&s;t be reconciled to him, before we pre&s;ume to offer our gift: that is, before we make our &s;upplication to God. The forgive|ne&s;s
<PB N="153" REF="138">
of others, therefore, we &s;ee, tho not the ab&s;olute condition of our own for|givene&s;s, is however a nece&s;&s;ary quali|fication. Tho alone, it cannot obtain our pardon; yet, at the &s;ame time, our pardon cannot be obtained without it. Nay, whoever u&s;es the Lord's prayer in an unforgiving temper; in&s;tead of begging a ble&s;&s;ing, begs a cur&s;e. He begs that God "will forgive him, as he forgives others;" that is, he propo&s;es his own uncharitable temper as the only rule, by which he wi&s;hes him&s;elf to be judged.</P>
<P>Having thus prayed, that God would forgive our pa&s;t &s;ins; we next beg his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in avoiding &s;in for the future. It hath already been ob&s;erved, that in this prayer, no mention is made of the merits of Chri&s;t; as the great atonement was not then offered. We may ob&s;erve
<PB N="154" REF="139">
al&s;o, that no mention is made of the Holy Spirit of God; which was not then promi&s;ed. And yet even then, we &s;ee, men were ordered to pray for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God; to lead them out of temptation, and deliver them from evil. In what way God a&s;&s;i&s;ted his faithful &s;ervants under the old di&s;pen&s;ation; or how that mode of divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance dif|fered from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance now afforded us under the di&s;pen&s;ation of grace; is a que&s;tion of very little importance. Cer|tain it is, that God always did a&s;&s;i&s;t his &s;ervants; and never left him&s;elf without a witne&s;s of his goodne&s;s in the moral, as well as in the natural world. But though this prayer was compo&s;ed before the &s;pirit of truth was promi&s;ed; and when man, of cour&s;e, could not u&s;e the petition for God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance in that &s;en&s;e, in which it was afterwards u&s;ed by chri&s;tians; yet the chri&s;tian &s;en&s;e
<PB N="155" REF="140">
ought certainly to be the &s;en&s;e in which it &s;hould now be u&s;ed. When we pray therefore for God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance to "deli|ver us from evil;" we pray for it in that way, in which God hath graciou&s;ly pro|mi&s;ed it in the go&s;pel; that is, through his Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>The mode of expre&s;&s;ion is rather &s;in|gular in the phra&s;e, "Lead us not into temptation." It immediately occurs, how can God lead us into temptation? God, St. James tells us, "tempteth no man."</P>
<P>But the phra&s;e, according to the jewi&s;h idiom, means no more, than that God would lead us out of temptation: that he would not &s;uffer us, in the &s;crip|ture-language, to be "tempted above our &s;trength; but that he would, with the temptation, make a way to e&s;cape." The purport of the petition therefore is,
<PB N="156" REF="141">
that he would graciou&s;ly conduct us through all the moral difficulties of this life; and that finally, having pa&s;&s;ed our pilgrimage here upon earth, he would take us to him&s;elf, &s;afe from all our dangers; and grant us peace in a happy immortality.</P>
<P>Surrounded by dangers, and difficul|ties of every kind, great rea&s;on have we for the&s;e petitions. Every object around us&mdash;every period of age&mdash;every &s;tation of life&mdash;every temper of mind&mdash;our pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;our appetites&mdash;our imagina|tion&mdash;our very rea&s;on&mdash;all con&s;pire in furni&s;hing abundant matter either to mi&s;lead or to &s;educe us. The poor are tempted to di&s;hone&s;ty, and to repine at God: the rich are tempted by wanton|ne&s;s to forget him. The life of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and the life of lei&s;ure, abound equally with temptations. The man of
<PB N="157" REF="142">
commerce with the world, finds them in company: nor can the reclu&s;e avoid them in &s;olitude. Thus &s;urrounded by temptations, human power is in&s;ufficient to carry us &s;afely through them. To heaven therefore we mu&s;t pray for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. "With God all things are po&s;&s;ible." His power co-operating with our endeavours, will enable us to meet our adver&s;ary on &s;uperior ground. "It can lead us out of temptation; and de|liver us from evil."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART V.</HEAD>
<P>Having thus put up our petitions to God, we conclude with an a&s;&s;urance of our firme&s;t confidence in him. Faith, we know, is one of the greate&s;t requi|&s;ites of prayer. If we do not believe that God is able to grant our petitions, it is idle to make them. We pray there|fore
<PB N="158" REF="143">
to God&mdash;becau&s;e, "his is the king|dom, the power, and the glory, for ever, and ever." He is the &s;upreme di&s;po&s;er of all events: and his power, like his goodne&s;s, is above conception. We have the firme&s;t confidence there|fore, that he is both able and willing to grant all our rea&s;onable petitions.</P>
<P>The whole prayer then, according to this explanation, may be thus para|phra&s;ed:</P>
<P>O thou beneficent Being, our crea|tor, pre&s;erver, and father, have mercy upon the whole race of mankind. May we all have ju&s;t &s;entiments of thee. May thy true religion be e&s;tabli&s;hed throughout the world; and may men feel its influence; live &s;uitably to its precepts; and emulate, in their obe|dience, the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits of heaven.&mdash;

Grant us &s;uch a &s;hare of this world's good, as thou &s;ee&s;t mo&s;t proper for us. We a&s;k not for wealth, or power. Grant us the nece&s;&s;aries of life&mdash;the re&s;t we &s;ubmit to thee: and may we never, through the influence of the world, for|get our dependence upon thee&mdash;Grant, O Lord, that we may make our&s;elves proper objects of thy mercy and forgive|ne&s;s.

<P>The Jews were burdened with a hea|vy load of the&s;e po&s;itive duties. One may almo&s;t &s;ay, the &s;pirit of the Mo&s;aic law con&s;i&s;ted in them. In ceremonies al&s;o con&s;i&s;ted entirely the religion of the heathens.

<P><PB N="164" REF="148">Never was any &s;y&s;tem of religion &s;o free from the burden of ceremonies as chri&s;tianity; never was any religion &s;o purely addre&s;&s;ed to the heart. The two &s;acraments, of bapti&s;m, and the Lord's &s;upper, are the only ceremonies ordain|ed by Chri&s;t; both certainly very ap|po&s;ite&mdash;bapti&s;m, as an outward te&s;timo|ny of our entrance into the chri&s;tian religion; and the Lord's &s;upper, as an outward te&s;timony of our continuance in it.

<P><PB N="165" REF="149">With regard to the nature of a &s;acra|ment in general, it is fir&s;t a&s;ked, how many &s;acraments Chri&s;t hath ordained?</P>
<P>The an&s;wer is, Two only, as gene|rally nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation; viz. bapti&s;m, and the &s;upper of the Lord.</P>
<P>This que&s;tion points chiefly at the papi&s;ts, who hold &s;even &s;acraments&mdash; bapti&s;m, the Lord's &s;upper, confirma|tion, matrimony, penance, orders, and extreme unction. Now as the word &s;acrament is no where defined in &s;crip|ture; we have no objection to a dozen &s;acraments, in&s;tead of &s;even, if the pa|pi&s;ts chu&s;e it: all we contend for, is, that none of them &s;hould be placed upon an equal footing with bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper; which, accor|ding to our definition of a &s;acrament,
<PB N="166" REF="150">
are the only two that are ordained by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The word &s;acrament originally im|plied the oath which &s;oldiers took to their leader; and under this idea it was fir&s;t adopted into the language of reli|gion. But its meaning, in the earlier ages, was very indefinite: and we find it u&s;ed among the writers of the fir&s;t centuries, to expre&s;s any thing my&s;te|rious in religion. By degrees, it ob|tained a clo&s;er acceptation; and among prote&s;tants was, at length, confined merely to bapti&s;m, and the Lord's &s;up|per. However, &s;till unfortunately, the old idea of a my&s;tery in &s;ome degree cleaves to it; and has been of prejudice to one of the&s;e rites e&s;pecially; which in it&s;elf &s;eems to be as &s;imple, as it is &s;ig|nificant.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="151">We define a &s;acrament to be an out|ward, and vi&s;ible &s;ign of an inward and &s;piritual grace; ordained by Chri&s;t him|&s;elf as a means, whereby we receive the &s;ame, and a pledge to a&s;&s;ure us there|of.</P>
<P>In a &s;acrament, there mu&s;t fir&s;t be an outward, vi&s;ible &s;ign of an inward and &s;piritual grace; that is, a &s;en&s;ible repre|&s;entation of &s;ome benefit received.</P>
<P>A &s;acrament mu&s;t, &s;econdly, be di&s;|tingui&s;hed from other ceremonies, by being ordained by Chri&s;t. Common ceremonies the church may decree, and abrogate at plea&s;ure. They are u&s;eful merely for the &s;ake of order; and un|der different circum&s;tances, different ceremonies may take place. But a &s;a|crament, as ordained by Chri&s;t, is of perpetual obligation.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="152">La&s;tly, a &s;acrament is a means where|by we receive the grace of God, and a pledge to a&s;&s;ure us thereof.&mdash;The go|&s;pel, we know, is a gracious covenant between God and man. On our part, the conditions are faith, and obedience. On God's part, the forgivene&s;s of our &s;ins, and eternal life. Now the &s;acra|ments of bapti&s;m, and the Lord's &s;up|per, are the appointed means, whereby we receive, or declare our acceptance of the&s;e conditions; and our re&s;olution of ob&s;erving them. And on God's part, they are a kind of pledge, and &s;ecurity, that the&s;e gracious conditions &s;hall be performed. Seals, and &s;ignatures, are vi&s;ible &s;igns, which have in all ages been thought nece&s;&s;ary in the execution of a covenant: they are nece&s;&s;ary to re|duce into a formal act, what would otherwi&s;e be only an intention of the mind. In conformity to human ideas,
<PB N="169" REF="153">
God thought fit to appoint circumci&s;ion, as a ratification of the Jewi&s;h covenant. St. Paul mentions it under the idea of a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 11.</NOTE> &s;eal, by which that covenant was confirmed.&mdash;Under the &s;ame idea, the two &s;acraments were appointed; and may be con&s;idered, on God's part, as his &s;eals to the covenant of grace: or, (as it is here phra&s;ed) pledges to a&s;&s;ure us thereof.</P>
<P>A &s;acrament, in general, being thus defined, the &s;acrament of bapti&s;m is next con&s;idered; in which, if we con&s;i|der the inward grace, we &s;hall &s;ee how aptly the &s;ign repre&s;ents it.&mdash;The in|ward grace, or thing &s;ignified, we are told, is "a death unto &s;in, and a new birth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s:" by which is

meant that great renovation of nature, that purity of heart, which the chri&s;tian religion is intended to produce. And &s;urely there cannot be a more &s;ignifi|cant &s;ign of this than water, on account of its clean&s;ing nature. As water re|fre&s;hes the body, and purifies it from all contracted filth; it aptly repre&s;ents that renovation of nature, which clean|&s;es the &s;oul from the impurities of &s;in. Water indeed, among the ancients, was more adapted to the thing &s;ignified, than it is at pre&s;ent among us. They u&s;ed immer&s;ion in bapti&s;ing: &s;o that the child being dipped into the water, and rai&s;ed out again; bapti&s;m with them was more &s;ignificant of a new birth un|to righteou&s;ne&s;s. But though we, in the&s;e colder climates, think immer&s;ion an un&s;afe practice; yet the original meaning is &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>

<P>The primitive church was extremely &s;trict on this head. In tho&s;e times, be|fore chri&s;tianity was e&s;tabli&s;hed, when adults offered them&s;elves to bapti&s;m, no one was admitted, till he had given a very &s;atisfactory evidence of his repen|tance; and till, on good grounds, he could profe&s;s his faith in Chri&s;t: and it was afterwards expected from him, that he &s;hould prove his faith, and repen|tance, by a regular obedience, during the future part of his life.</P>

<P>Whether infants &s;hould be admitted to bapti&s;m, or whether that &s;acrament &s;hould be deferred till years of di&s;cre|tion; is a que&s;tion in the chri&s;tian church, which hath been agitated with &s;ome animo&s;ity.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Sacrament of the Lord's &s;upper&mdash;its end&mdash;&s;ignificancy of its &s;ymbols&mdash; the words "verily and indeed taken" explained&mdash;frame of mind requi&s;ite on receiving it&mdash;other ends in the &s;a|crament, be&s;ides tho&s;e propo&s;ed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="177" REF="159">HAVING thus con&s;idered the &s;a|crament of bapti&s;m, the cate|chi&s;m proceeds la&s;tly to the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion is an inquiry into the original of the in&s;titution: "Why was the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper ordained?"</P>
<P>It was ordained, we are informed,&mdash; "for the continual remembrance of the &s;acrifice of the death of Chri&s;t; and of the benefits which we receive thereby."</P>
<P>In examining a &s;acrament in general, we have already &s;een, that both bap|ti&s;m, and the Lord's &s;upper, were ori|ginally in&s;tituted as the "means of re|ceiving the grace of God; and as pledges to a&s;&s;ure us thereof."</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="160">But be&s;ides the&s;e primary ends, they have each a &s;econdary one; in repre|&s;enting the two mo&s;t important truths of religion; which gives them more force, and influence. Bapti&s;m, we have &s;een, repre&s;ents that renovation of our &s;inful nature, which the go&s;pel was in|tended to introduce: and the peculiar end, which the Lord's &s;upper had in view, was the &s;acrifice of the death of Chri&s;t; with all the benefits which ari&s;e from it&mdash;the remi&s;&s;ion of our &s;ins&mdash;and the reconciliation of the world to God. "This do," &s;aid our Saviour, (allud|ing to the pa&s;&s;over, which the Lord's &s;upper was de&s;igned to &s;uper&s;ede) not as hitherto, in memory of your deliver|ance from Egypt; but in memory of that greater deliverance, of which the other was only a type: "Do it in re|membrance of me."</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="161">The outward part, or &s;ign of the Lord's &s;upper, is "bread and wine"&mdash; the things &s;ignified are the "body and blood of Chri&s;t."&mdash;In examining the &s;acrament of bapti&s;m, I endeavoured to &s;hew, how very apt a &s;ymbol water is in that ceremony. Bread and wine al&s;o are &s;ymbols equally apt in repre|&s;enting the body and blood of Chri&s;t: and in the u&s;e of the&s;e particular &s;ym|bols, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that our Saviour had an eye to the Jewi&s;h pa&s;&s;over; in which it was a cu&s;tom to drink wine, and to eat bread. He might have in&s;tituted any other apt &s;ymbols for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; but it was his u&s;ual practice, through the whole &s;y&s;tem of his in&s;titution, to make it, in every part, as familiar as po&s;&s;i|ble: and for this rea&s;on he &s;eems to have cho&s;en &s;uch &s;ymbols as were then in u&s;e; that he might give as little of|fence,
<PB N="180" REF="162">
as po&s;&s;ible, in a matter of indif|ference.</P>
<P>As our Saviour, in the in&s;titution of his &s;upper, ordered both the bread and the wine to be received; it is certainly a great error in papi&s;ts, to deny the cup to the laity. They &s;ay indeed, that, as both fle&s;h and blood are united in the &s;ub&s;tance of the human body; &s;o are they in the &s;acramental bread; which, according to them, is changed, or, as they phra&s;e it, tran&s;ub&s;tantiated into the real body of Chri&s;t. If they have no other rea&s;on, why do they ad|mini&s;ter wine to the clergy? The cler|gy might participate equally of both in the bread.&mdash;But the plain truth is, they are de&s;irous, by this invention, to add an air of my&s;tery to the &s;acrament, and a &s;uper&s;titious reverence to the prie&s;t; as if he, being endowed with &s;ome pe|culiar
<PB N="181" REF="163">
holine&s;s, might be allowed the u&s;e of both.</P>
<P>There is a difficulty in this part of the catechi&s;m, which &s;hould not be pa&s;&s;ed over. We are told, that "the body and blood of Chri&s;t are verily, and indeed taken, and received by the faithful in the Lord's &s;upper." This expre&s;&s;ion &s;ounds very like the popi&s;h doctrine, ju&s;t mentioned, of tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation. The true &s;en&s;e of the words undoubtedly is, that the faithful be|liever only, verily and indeed receives the benefit of the &s;acrament: but the expre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be allowed to be inac|curate, as it is capable of an interpre|tation &s;o entirely oppo&s;ite to that which the church of England hath always profe&s;&s;ed.&mdash;I would not willingly &s;up|po&s;e, as &s;ome have done, that the com|pilers of the catechi&s;m meant to manage
<PB N="182" REF="164">
the affair of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation with the papi&s;ts. It is one thing to &s;hew a libe|rality of &s;entiment in matters of indif|ference; and another to &s;peak timidly, and ambiguou&s;ly, where e&s;&s;entials are concerned.</P>
<P>It is next a&s;ked, What benefits we receive from the Lord's &s;upper? To which it is an&s;wered, "The &s;trength|ening and refre&s;hing of our &s;ouls by the body and blood of Chri&s;t, as our bodies are by the bread and wine." As our bodies are &s;trengthened and refre&s;h|ed, in a natural way, by bread and wine; &s;o &s;hould our &s;ouls be, in a &s;pi|ritual way, by a devout commemoration of the pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t. By gratefully remembering what he &s;uffered for us, we &s;hould be excited to a greater ab|horrence of &s;in, which was the cau&s;e of his &s;ufferings. Every time we partake
<PB N="183" REF="165">
of this &s;acrament, like faithful &s;oldiers, we take a fre&s;h oath to our leader; and &s;hould be animated anew, by his ex|ample, to per&s;evere in the &s;piritual con|flict, in which, under him, we are en|gaged.</P>
<P>It is la&s;tly a&s;ked, "What is required of them, who come to the Lord's &s;up|per?" To which we an&s;wer, "That we &s;hould examine our&s;elves, whether we repent us truly of our former &s;ins&mdash; &s;tedfa&s;tly purpo&s;ing to lead a new life&mdash; have a lively faith in God's mercy through Chri&s;t&mdash;with a thankful re|membrance of his death; and to be in charity with all men."</P>
<P>That pious frame of mind is here, in very few words, pointed out; which a Chri&s;tian ought to cheri&s;h, and culti|vate in him&s;elf at all times; but e&s;pe|cially,
<PB N="184" REF="166">
upon the performance of any &s;olemn act of religion. Very little in|deed is &s;aid in &s;cripture, of any particu|lar frame of mind, which &s;hould accom|pany the performance of this duty; but it may ea&s;ily be inferred from the nature of the duty it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, "we &s;hould repent us truly of our former &s;ins; &s;tedfa&s;tly purpo&s;ing to lead a new life." He who performs a religious exerci&s;e, without being earne&s;t in this point; adds only a phari&s;aical hypocricy to his other &s;ins. Unle&s;s he &s;eriou&s;ly re&s;olve to lead a good life, he had better be all of a piece; and not pretend, by receiving the &s;acrament, to a piety which he does not feel.</P>
<P>The&s;e "&s;tedfa&s;t purpo&s;es of leading a new life," form a very becoming ex|erci&s;e
<PB N="185" REF="167">
to chri&s;tians. The lives even of the be&s;t of men afford only a mortify|ing retro&s;pect. Though they may have conquered &s;ome of their wor&s;t propen|&s;ities; yet the triumphs of &s;in over them, at the various periods of their lives, will always be remembered with &s;or|row; and may always be remembered with advantage; keeping them on their guard for the future, and &s;trengthening them more and more in all their good re&s;olutions of obedience.&mdash;And when can the&s;e meditions ari&s;e more properly, than when we are performing a rite, in&s;tituted on purpo&s;e to commemorate the great atonement for &s;in?</P>
<P>To our repentance, and re&s;olutions of obedience, we are required to add "a lively faith in God's mercy through Chri&s;t; with a thankful remembrance of his death." We &s;hould impre&s;s our|&s;elves
<PB N="186" REF="168">
with the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of humility &mdash;totally rejecting every idea of our own merit&mdash;hoping for God's favour only through the merits of our great Redeemer&mdash;and with hearts full of gra|titude, tru&s;ting only to his all-&s;ufficient &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, we are required, at the cele|bration of this great rite, to be "in charity with all men." It commemo|rates the greate&s;t in&s;tance of love that can be conceived; and &s;hould therefore rai&s;e in us corre&s;pondent affections. It &s;hould excite in us that con&s;tant flow of benevolence, in which the &s;pirit of religion con&s;i&s;ts; and without which indeed we can have no religion at all. Love is the very di&s;tingui&s;hing badge of chri&s;tianity: "By this," &s;aid our great Ma&s;ter, "&s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples."</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="169">One &s;pecies of charity &s;hould, at this time, never be forgotten; and that is, the forgivene&s;s of others. No ac|ceptable gift can be offered at this al|tar, but in the &s;pirit of reconciliation. &mdash;Hence it was, that the ancient chri&s;|tians in&s;tituted, at the celebration of the Lord's &s;upper, what they called love-fea&s;ts. They thought, they could not give a better in&s;tance of their being in perfect charity with each other; than by joining, all ranks together, in one common meal.&mdash;By degrees, in|deed, this well-meant cu&s;tom degene|rated; and it may not be ami&s;s to ob|&s;erve here, that the pa&s;&s;ages <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi.</NOTE> in which the&s;e enormities are rebuked, have been variou&s;ly mi&s;con&s;trued; and have fright|ened many well-meaning per&s;ons from the &s;acrament. Whereas what the a|po&s;tle here &s;ays, hath no other relation
<PB N="188" REF="170">
to this rite, than as it was attended by a particular abu&s;e in receiving it: and as this is a mode of abu&s;e, which doth not now exi&s;t; the apo&s;tle's reproof &s;eems not to affect the chri&s;tians of this age.</P>
<P>What the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 305.</NOTE> primary, and what the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 311</NOTE> &s;econdary ends in the two &s;acraments were, I have endeavoured to explain. But there might be others.</P>
<P>God might intend them as trials of our faith. The divine truths of the go&s;pel &s;peak for them&s;elves: but the performance of a po&s;itive duty re&s;ts only on faith.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;titutions are al&s;o &s;trong ar|guments for the truth of chri&s;tianity. We trace the ob&s;ervance of them into
<PB N="189" REF="171">
the very earlie&s;t times of the go&s;pel. We can trace no other origin, than what the &s;criptures give us. The&s;e rites therefore greatly tend to corrobo|rate the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>God al&s;o, who knows what is in man, might conde&s;cend &s;o far to his weakne&s;s, as to give him the&s;e external badges of religion, to keep the &s;pirit of it more alive. And it is indeed pro|bable, that nothing has contributed more than the&s;e ceremonies to pre&s;erve a &s;en&s;e of religion among mankind. It is a melancholy proof of this, that no contentions in the chri&s;tian church have been more violent, nor carried on with more acrimony, and unchri&s;tian zeal, than the contentions about bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper; as if the very e&s;&s;ence of religion con&s;i&s;ted in this or that mode of ob&s;erving the&s;e rites.&mdash; But this is the abu&s;e of them.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="172">Let us be better taught: let us re|ceive the&s;e &s;acraments, for the gracious purpo&s;es for which our Lord injoined them, with gratitude, and with reve|rence. But let us not lay a greater &s;tre&s;s upon them than our Lord intend|ed. Heaven, we doubt not, may be gained, when there have been the means of receiving neither the one &s;acrament nor the other. But unle&s;s our affec|tions are right, and our lives an&s;wer|able to them; we can never plea&s;e God, though we perform the externals of re|ligion with ever &s;o much exactne&s;s. We may err in our notions about the &s;acraments: the world has long been divided on the&s;e &s;ubjects; and a gra|cious God, it may be hoped, will par|don our errors. But in matters of prac|tice, we have no apology for error. The great lines of our duty are drawn &s;o &s;trong, that a deviation here, is not error, but guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="173">Let us then, to conclude from the whole, make it our principal care to purify our hearts in the &s;ight of God. Let us be&s;eech him to increa&s;e the in|fluence of his Holy Spirit within us, that our faith may be of that kind, "which worketh by love;" that all our affections, and from them our ac|tions may flow in a &s;teady cour&s;e of obedience; that each day may correct the la&s;t by a &s;incere repentance of our mi&s;takes in life; and that we may con|tinue gradually to approach nearer the idea of chri&s;tian perfection. Let us do this, di&s;claiming, after all, any merits of our own; and not tru&s;ting in out|ward ob&s;ervances; but tru&s;ting in the merits of Chri&s;t to make up our defi|ciencies; and we need not fear our ac|ceptance with God.</P>
