<HEAD>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HOGARTH.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. HARRISON.</BYLINE>
<P>THAT truly original genius, the celebrated WILLIAM HOGARTH, was born in London, in 1697. After re|ceiving a tolerable education, he was apprenticed to an en|graver of arms and cyphers on plate, u&s;ually called a &s;ilver engraver; but the powerful impul&s;e of genius directed his &s;tudies to painting.</P>
<P>Much of his early life was pa&s;t in ob&s;curity. He chiefly employed his talents, in de&s;igning and engraving for the book|&s;ellers; who were then much wor&s;e patrons of the arts than they have &s;ince proved. He al&s;o painted family pictures and portraits; in all which performances he evinced more ability, than he acquired reward.</P>
<P>But his originality, in the mean time, was maturing to per|fection. He pur&s;ued Nature through her infinity; and con|templated her not through the opticks of imitation, but with his own &s;edulous and critical eye. Whenever he beheld a re|markable countenance, or witne&s;&s;ed any &s;triking occurrence, he was accu&s;tomed, by the immediate u&s;e of his pencil, to pre|&s;erve it's remembrance.</P>
<P>In 1730, he married the only daughter of Sir James Thorn|hill. This union was, indeed, a &s;tolen one. But the growing reputation of Hogarth at length effected a reconciliation with his father-in-law; and his Harlot's Progre&s;s, publi&s;hed in 1731, announced to the publick the rich acqui&s;ition of a Comick Painter.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">His merit now became con&s;picuous; and his pencil acquired, at every exertion, additional reputation. His Marriage A-la-mode, produced in 1745, gave ri&s;e to the celebrated comedy of the Clande&s;tine Marriage.</P>
<P>In 1753, he wrote his Analy&s;is of Beauty. In this work, he proves, by a variety of examples, that "a curve is the line of beauty, and that round &s;welling figures are mo&s;t plea&s;ing to the eye." An opinion which has been confirmed by &s;ub&s;equent writers.</P>
<P>The clo&s;e of his life was embittered by a &s;atirical conten|tion with Churchill, and Mr. Wilkes. Hogarth caricatured Churchill, and Churchill &s;ampooned Hogarth. "Never," &s;ays Lord Orford, "did two angry men, of their abilities, throw mud with le&s;s dexterity."</P>
<P>He was now vi&s;ibly declining in health; and died, Octo|ber 25, 1764.</P>
<P>This great arti&s;t has the glory of forming a &s;chool; and the ma&s;ter remains unrivalled by his &s;cholars. He paints to the under&s;tanding, and the heart; and his pictures may &s;erve as annals of the manners of the age. He is, in Painting, what Fielding is in Romance, or Moliere in Comedy.</P>
<P>Hogarth was buried at Chi&s;wick; and the following Epi|taph, written by his friend Garrick, is engraved on a neat pyramidical monument&mdash;
<Q><L>"Farewel, great Painter of Mankind,</L>
<L>Who reach'd the noble&s;t point of Art;</L>
<L>Who&s;e Pictur'd Morals charm the Mind,</L>
<L>And through the Eye correct the Heart.</L>
<L>If Genius fire thee, Reader, &s;tay;</L>
<L>If Nature touch thee, drop a tear:</L>
<L>If neither move thee, turn away,</L>
<L>For Hogarth's honour'd du&s;t lies here."</L></Q></P>
<P>When the Memorial on which the&s;e elegant lines are in|&s;cribed &s;hall have long been crumbled into du&s;t, the Works of Hogarth will be admired, if the love of merit then exi&s;ts in the world.</P>
<P>With the De&s;cription of &s;ome Print from the&s;e ine&s;timable Works, as well as a faithful Copy of the Print it&s;elf, we &s;hall commence our re&s;pective Numbers.</P>

<HEAD>PLATE I. THE FELLOW-'PRENTICES AT THEIR LOOMS.</HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;ign of this Series of Prints is of the fir&s;t import|ance to youth in a commercial nation. They are called INDUSTRY and IDLENESS: "exemplified," to u&s;e Hogarth's
<PB N="5" REF="7">own words, "in the conduct of Two Fellow-'Prentices; where the one, by taking good cour&s;es, and pur&s;uing points for which he was put apprentice, becomes a valuable man, and an ornament to his country&mdash;the other, by giving way to idle|ne&s;s, naturally falls into poverty, and ends fatally, as is ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t print." He adds that, "le&s;t any print &s;hould be mi&s;taken, the de&s;cription of each is engraved."</P>
<P>The quotations from Scripture applied to the different &s;cenes, are &s;aid to have been &s;elected by Hogarth's friend, the Rev. Mr. Arnold King. The pa&s;&s;ages for this Fir&s;t Plate are&mdash;</P>

<P>This intere&s;ting hi&s;tory, to u&s;e the language of the drama, opens with a &s;cene, which pre&s;ents to the &s;pectator our two heroes, the fellow-apprentices, &s;eated in the looms of their ma|&s;ter, a re&s;pectable &s;ilk-manufacturer of Spitalfields. One of them, who is depicted with an ingenuous and plea&s;ing counte|nance, appears diligently and attentively employed in weaving; while the other, who&s;e features expre&s;s an abject groveling mind, while his dre&s;s denotes neligence and &s;loth, &s;its fa&s;t a&s;leep, in a &s;eeming &s;tate of intoxication. This idea is con|firmed by the tankard and tobacco-pipe: and his ruling pa&s;|&s;ions are farther developed, by the ballad of <HI>"Moll Flanders,"</HI> &amp;c. on the wall; by the torn pamphlet of <HI>"The Prentices Guide;"</HI> and by the kitten's apparently familiar acquaintance with the unemployed &s;huttle, which has dropped from his hand, and &s;erves the animal for a plaything. The Ma&s;ter, who is &s;een entering, expre&s;&s;es an inclination to correct the idle apprentice with his uplifted cane; but &s;eems re&s;trained by reflecting on the little good to be expected from any cha&s;ti&s;ement of a lad in whom vicious habits are &s;o deeply rooted. The di&s;po&s;ition of the good youth is contra&s;ted with that of his fellow-apprentice, by the choice of tho&s;e excellent old ballads, <HI>"Turn again, Whit|tington,"</HI> and <HI>"The Valiant 'Prentice;"</HI> as well as by the clean and perfect &s;tate in which he has pre&s;erved his copy of <HI>"The 'Prentices Guide."</HI></P>

<HEAD>LAWS OF LAUGHING.</HEAD>
<P>LAUGHING is that noble faculty which di&s;tingui&s;hes man from bea&s;t, &s;ince it &s;hews the rationality of the &s;oul, which can be moved independent of the &s;en&s;es. It is the mark of rea&s;on, the badge of good-humour, and the &s;ign of mirth. Shak&s;peare &s;ays&mdash;
<PB N="6" REF="8">
<Q><L>"The man who hath not Mu&s;ick in him&s;elf,</L>
<L>And is not mov'd with concord of &s;weet &s;ounds,</L>
<L>Is fit for trea&s;ons, &s;tratagems, and &s;poils."</L></Q></P>
<P>And we may with great truth apply the &s;ame remark to&mdash;
<Q><L>The man who has not Mirth within him&s;elf,</L>
<L>And can't be mov'd to laughter by a joke.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is &s;aid of the Roman Ca&s;&s;ius, that&mdash;
<Q><L>"He &s;eldom &s;mil'd; or &s;mil'd in &s;uch a &s;ort,</L>
<L>As if he &s;corn'd him&s;elf, that could be mov'd</L>
<L>To &s;mile at any thing."</L></Q></P>
<P>Now this fellow Ca&s;&s;ius always lived a melancholy life, and at la&s;t died a murderer; but the man who lives laughing, ge|nerally dies in his bed, as an hone&s;t man ought.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to laughing, we &s;hould con&s;ider three things: fir&s;t, who laughs; &s;econdly, who is laughed at; and, thirdly, what the laughing is about.</P>
<P>When a man tells a merry tale, he &s;hould laugh inwardly, and enjoy the joke in his mind more than in his countenance; for he who laughs aloud at his own joke is in the court of Comus con&s;idered as a &s;ool.</P>
<P>When a merry &s;tory is ended, you may be allowed to make a little noi&s;e in laughing, as it &s;hews your approbation of what was meant for your entertainment; but never break into the middle of a &s;tory by loud laughter, &s;uch interruptions being very di&s;agreeable to the company, as well as to the &s;peaker; and all the merry ammunition &s;hould be pre&s;erved for the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Laughing not only increa&s;es the good-humour of &s;ociety, and promotes &s;ocial enjoyment, but it is of infinite &s;ervice to the health, and has &s;ometimes &s;aved the lives of &s;ick per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The famous Doctor Radcliffe was once &s;ent for into the country by a gentleman who was dangerou&s;ly ill of a quin&s;ey; and &s;oon perceiving that no application would be of &s;ervice, he de&s;ired the cook to make a large ha&s;ty-pudding, and let his &s;ervant bring it up. While the cook was engaged in this bu|&s;ine&s;s, he took his man a&s;ide, and in&s;tructed him. The man accordingly brought up the pudding in great order, and &s;et it on the table in full view of the patient. "Come, John," &s;aid the doctor, "you love ha&s;ty-pudding; eat &s;ome with me, for I believe you came out without your breakfa&s;t." Both then fell to with their &s;poons; but John's going twice to his mouth to his ma&s;ter's once, the doctor took occa&s;ion to quarrel with him, by dabbing a &s;poonful of hot pudding in his face. John threw another at his ma&s;ter; who, apparently in a violent pa&s;|&s;ion, quitted his &s;poon, took the ha&s;ty-pudding up by handfuls, and threw it at his man, who battled him again in the &s;ame
<PB N="7" REF="9">manner, till they were both all over in a woeful pickle. The gentleman, having a full view of this comical combat, was &s;o delighted at it, that he bur&s;t into a mo&s;t immoderate fit of laughter, which broke the quin&s;ey, and compleatly cured him.</P>
<P>"Laugh, and be fat," is a common &s;aying; therefore I would recommend laughing to the con&s;umptive, ill-conditioned, and &s;plenetick, as the certain cure of their di&s;orders. When we are laughed at, we &s;hould never be angry, as that &s;erves only to increa&s;e the laughter of tho&s;e who jeer us. The only way is, to retort je&s;t for je&s;t, and joke for joke: and, when a &s;tory is told to expo&s;e any of our follies, we &s;hould not only take the hint to amend them, but endeavour, at the &s;ame time, to expo&s;e, by an appo&s;ite &s;tory, &s;ome folly peculiar to the per|&s;on who attempted to expo&s;e us, that he may likewi&s;e come in for his &s;hare of improvement. Thus laughing will be of mutual benefit, and good-humour and in&s;truction go hand in hand. Be&s;ides, a retort has great force: &s;ince it not only takes away the &s;ting of a former je&s;t, but e&s;tabli&s;hes our reputation for a ready turn of wit.</P>
<P>Thus, when the pay of a certain regiment in France had been kept back for a long time, and one of the officers being greatly pre&s;&s;ed for money, and much di&s;contented, went to the colonel, &s;aying&mdash;"Three words with you, Sir&mdash;money or di&s;|charge." The latter immediately replied&mdash;"Four with you, Sir&mdash;neither one nor t'other."</P>
<P>But as we may not always be able to parry the &s;arca&s;ms of wit with &s;ucce&s;s, we &s;hould endeavour to gain &s;uch an a&s;cen|dancy over our pa&s;&s;ions, as to be always in a good humour with our&s;elves. The tranquillity of our own minds will prove the be&s;t de&s;ence again&s;t the wor&s;t attacks.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the&s;e remarks with a &s;hort &s;tory, which every reader may apply as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>When gods and godde&s;&s;es made frequent vi&s;its to mankind, a beautiful and young roving divinity went into a nation of hunch-back people. On entering the capital, he was &s;ur|rounded by a multitude of the inhabitants, who derided him mo&s;t unmercifully for having what they deemed &s;o odious a form; and would have proceeded to &s;till greater violence, had not one, wi&s;er than the re&s;t, &s;uddenly cried out&mdash;"My friends and countrymen, con&s;ider well what you are doing! Let us not in&s;ult this unhappy piece of deformi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y. If Heaven has lavi&s;hed on us all the gifts of beauty; if it has adorned our backs with a noble mountain of fle&s;h; let us be filled with gratitude, repair to our temples, and return thanks to the immortal Gods!" This is the hi&s;tory of human vanity; for, to &s;ucceed in any country, we mu&s;t carry the hunch of the nation into which we travel.</P>

<HEAD>PLEASURES OF BEING IN DEBT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY ARTHUR MURPHY, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<P>I Hope you will not refu&s;e place to a corre&s;pondent, who means to &s;hew the futility of a maxim, which has gained credit with mo&s;t people, though extremely ill-grounded, as I think I can fairly evince, from an experimental knowledge of mankind.</P>
<P>You undoubtedly recollect that Ovid has, in one of his Ele|gies, the following lines&mdash;
<Q><L>"Donec eris felix multos numerabis Amicos;</L>
<L>Tempora &s;i fuerint nubila, folus eris."</L></Q></P>
<P>Now, it is &s;o far from being true, that a man is &s;urrounded with friends in pro&s;perity, and is left de&s;titute under his mis|fortunes, that I will undertake to prove the very rever&s;e: in doing this, I flatter my&s;elf, I &s;hall &s;erve the purpo&s;es of virtue, and vindicate the dignity of human nature.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, then, that I came to this town, a few years &s;ince, with intent to read the law, having ju&s;t fortune enough to &s;upport me in my &s;tudies, until I might fix my&s;elf in a tole|rable road of bu&s;ine&s;s. For this purpo&s;e I lodged in one of the Inns of Court; and the oeconomy which I was obliged to ob&s;erve rendering it impo&s;&s;ible for me to go much into com|pany, I &s;oon found out that I led a very muzzy &s;ort of a life. I therefore &s;hifted the &s;cene; and, though in a &s;hort time, I found means to run out my little fortune, I cannot &s;ay that I was relinqui&s;hed by the world on this account. It is true that &s;ome of my acquaintance totally de&s;erted me; but it was the occa&s;ion, at the &s;ame time, that others were more earne&s;tly attached than they would otherwi&s;e have been. I remember the la&s;t word my aunt in the country &s;aid to me, was&mdash;"Bob, wherever you go, be &s;ure to make friends for your&s;elf." This advice, I will venture to &s;ay, I have had the addre&s;s to conform to, with great &s;ucce&s;s, as will appear from the &s;equel.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the friend&s;hips of the world are leagues in debauch|ery and intemperance, made in the drawing of a cork, and often ended in the &s;ame manner. <HI>"Out of &s;ight out of mind,"</HI> is cer|tainly true, with regard to the generality of connections: but the impre&s;&s;ions I have made on the minds of my friends are not &s;o ea&s;ily effaced; on the contrary, when it happens that I am &s;eldom &s;een by them, they are known to be in very great &s;olicitude about me, are con&s;tantly very earne&s;t in their en|quiries after me, and the di&s;cour&s;e they u&s;ually have with each other is&mdash;"Have you &s;een our old friend lately? I can't think what's become of him; I hope he is not gone out of
<PB N="9" REF="11">town&mdash;I have not &s;een him for a long time&mdash;Faith, I am very unea&s;y about him&mdash;I wi&s;h to God he would &s;ee and &s;ettle his affairs&mdash;He's a very carele&s;s young fellow&mdash;a great deal too wild&mdash;throws away his money like dirt&mdash;I have called upon him morning after morning, but all to no purpo&s;e&mdash;I'd give a bottle of wine I could meet with him&mdash;I'd rather that than my dinner&mdash;I never longed &s;o much to &s;ee any body."</P>
<P>The&s;e are the general expre&s;&s;ions of anxiety, which my friends expre&s;s on my account; and there are &s;ome of them who are not content to re&s;t here&mdash;words co&s;t nothing; they carry the thing to &s;uch a length as to employ a couple of fellows, who are daily in all quarters of the town, hunting and prying about for me. As there are few in&s;tances of &s;uch earne&s;t friend&s;hip in the world, I am &s;en&s;ible what I have &s;aid may have a romantick appearance; and the reader may &s;ug|ge&s;t to him&s;elf, that I am entertaining him all this while with a novel; but, I mu&s;t take leave to a&s;&s;ure you that every word is literally true; and, what may perhaps rai&s;e your idea &s;till higher, not one of all the&s;e people has ever got a &s;hilling by me; and, I verily believe, few of them ever will. Having &s;aid thus much in the prai&s;e of the&s;e my well-wi&s;hers, it will naturally be de&s;ired of me, to inform the world who and what they are, who are in &s;uch concern about a &s;tranger. Not to keep you any longer in &s;u&s;pence, I will now tell you, that I have experienced all this genero&s;ity from my Creditors.</P>
<P>By this it will appear that the plea&s;ure of being in debt, though very common in life, is very little under&s;tood by the generality of tho&s;e who addict them&s;elves to this gratification. The art, in all the&s;e ca&s;es, is to refine upon the occurrences and di&s;appointments to which our &s;tate is liable; and, for my part, the plea&s;ure ju&s;t mentioned is one of the mo&s;t valuable enjoyments of my life. My morning levee is as great as any nobleman's; whereas, in the days that I could &s;ay I was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a competence, I never had any vi&s;itor whatever, except a laundre&s;s to make my bed in the Temple. But now the ca&s;e is perfectly altered: there is a con&s;tant crowd of atten|dants about my doors; and, to tho&s;e that are admitted, I have the plea&s;ure of making as many promi&s;es as a mini&s;ter of &s;tate, be&s;ides a lo&s;ty pride in keeping them much after the &s;ame fa&s;hion. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, it will now and then happen, that they who be&s;t know how to make their court, and have the art of taking a pliant hour, &s;ometimes prevail upon me to appoint a day for the completion of their wi&s;hes. As things of con&s;equence cannot be done in a violent hurry, the day agreed upon is generally very di&s;tant, may be from &s;ix to nine or twelve months; during which &s;pace of time, it is ob&s;erv|able,
<PB N="10" REF="12">that their good-nature never &s;uffers the lea&s;t abatement, but they remain as &s;olicitous as ever, frequently expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t tender regard for my welfare. "My dear Sir, do take a little care of your&s;elf&mdash;It goes to my very heart to hear you cough &s;o hard&mdash;Why, you'll not live three months at this rate&mdash;Be advi&s;ed by me, and put a &s;tocking about your neck to-night, and take &s;omething to &s;weat you a little and ea&s;e your che&s;t. You &s;hould not drink &s;o much&mdash;Con&s;ider, it im|pairs both con&s;titution and pur&s;e&mdash;You know it's for your good I &s;peak&mdash;You'd be a great lo&s;s to your friends&mdash;Take up a little: fle&s;h and blood can't hold it always."</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, am I beloved; and that for no other rea&s;on, but my addre&s;s in making friends for my&s;elf: and I am &s;o clo&s;ely watched by the&s;e generous creatures, that it is totally out of my power to take any wrong &s;tep, that might be detrimental to my affairs. Of this I had a convincing proof about a year ago, when the interpo&s;ition of my taylor hindered me from committing a very incon&s;iderate action. I was going with a friend to take a trip to Paris, by which expedient I mu&s;t cer|tainly have been drained of all my ready-money; but the vi|gilance of my friend contrived to have me &s;topped as I was ju&s;t &s;tepping into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, and I was thence conducted to a generous bailiff's hou&s;e in Gray's Inn Lane, for the &s;um of three hundred pounds. Here I remained confined till my pa&s;&s;ion for travel was perfectly cooled; and when I was at length re&s;tored to my liberty, my above-mentioned friends, took particular care not to leave me a &s;ingle &s;hilling, for fear I &s;hould have the &s;ame unhappy turn a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>While I thus enjoy the a&s;&s;iduity and benevolence of &s;uch a number, who are kind enough to intere&s;t them&s;elves in my af|fairs, I mu&s;t own there is a &s;pecies of Creditors who are an exception to the general rule; for though all tho&s;e of whom I have hitherto been &s;peaking, are upon every occa&s;ion highly plea&s;ed to meet me, this la&s;t cla&s;s dete&s;t the very &s;ight of me. As I am not con&s;cious that I have ever done any thing to in|cur their di&s;plea&s;ure to &s;o great a degree, their aver&s;ion &s;hocks me the more; and, notwith&s;tanding all the pains I have taken to &s;often them by politene&s;s, they &s;till remain inexorable. Whenever I do not pay them what is due to them, I en|deavour to put them off with the hand&s;ome&s;t apology in my power: but it is all to no purpo&s;e; I have run too far in ar|rears, and they are not by any means to be &s;atisfied. As I &s;hould be glad if you would give them a word of advice, I will ju&s;t hint to you that the perfonages whom I mean are no other than Gentlemen's Servants. The cry among them all is&mdash; "What can a poor &s;erving-man do, if he is robbed of his
<PB N="11" REF="13">vales by &s;uch &s;coundrels?" They are all very unwilling to let me run farther in their debt; and therefore it is, I can hardly get any thing out of their hands. If I call for beer at table, they are &s;ure not to hear me till their ma&s;ter orders them to &s;erve the gentleman; then I receive the leavings of the tan|kard ju&s;t out of the hands of the mo&s;t capacious &s;wallow in the company. In &s;hort, the peevi&s;hne&s;s of the&s;e my Creditors is a great di&s;count upon my happine&s;s; and, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, there is no kind of plea&s;ure in being in debt to them. However, I mu&s;t endeavour to bear this inconvenience; and, if you will be plea&s;ed to in&s;ert this letter, I &s;hall be proud to get into your books; and &s;hall have the farther plea&s;ure of being indebted to you for this act of civility, which will always oblige me to be your mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant, and &s;incere well-wi&s;her,</P>

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS FOR SERVANTS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DEAN SWIFT.</BYLINE>
<P>WHEN your ma&s;ter or lady calls a &s;ervant by name, if that &s;ervant be not in the way, none of you are to an&s;wer, for then there will be no end of your drudgery: and ma&s;ters them&s;elves allow, that if a &s;ervant comes when he is called it is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>When you have done a fault, be always pert and in&s;olent, and behave your&s;elf as if you were the injured per&s;on; this will immediately put your ma&s;ter or lady off their mettle.</P>
<P>If you &s;ee your ma&s;ter wronged by any of your fellow-&s;er|vants, be &s;ure to conceal it, for fear of being called a tell-tale: however, there is one exception in ca&s;e of a favourite &s;ervant, who is ju&s;tly hated by the whole family; who therefore are bound in prudence to lay all the faults they can upon the favourite.</P>
<P>The cook, the butler, the groom, the market-man, and every other &s;ervant who is concerned in the expences of the family, &s;hould act as if the whole of his ma&s;ter's e&s;tate ought to be applied to that &s;ervant's particular bu&s;ine&s;s. For in|&s;tance, if the cook computes his ma&s;ter's e&s;tate to be a thou|&s;and pounds a year, he rea&s;onably concludes, that a thou&s;and pounds a year will afford meat enough, and therefore he need not be &s;paring; the butler makes the &s;ame judgment, &s;o may the groom and the coachman; and thus every branch of expence will be filled to your ma&s;ter's honour.</P>
<P>When you are child before company, (which with &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to our ma&s;ters and ladies is an unmannerly practice) it often happens that &s;ome &s;tranger will have the good-nature to
<PB N="12" REF="14">drop a word in your excu&s;e; in &s;uch a ca&s;e you will have a good title to ju&s;tify your&s;elf, and may righty conclude, that, whenever he chides you afterwards on other occa&s;ions, he may be in the wrong; in which opinion you will be the better confirmed by &s;tating the ca&s;e to your fellow &s;ervants in your own way, who will certainly decide in your favour: there|fore, as I have &s;aid before, whenever you are chidden, com|plain as if you were injured.</P>
<P>It often happens, that &s;ervants &s;ent on me&s;&s;ages are apt to &s;tay out &s;omewhat longer than the me&s;&s;age requires, perhaps two, four, &s;ix, or eight hours, or &s;ome &s;uch trifle; for the temptation to be &s;ure was great, and fle&s;h and blood cannot always re&s;i&s;t: when you return, the ma&s;ter &s;torms, the lady &s;colds; &s;trip|ping, cudgelling, and turning off, is the word. But here you ought to be provided with a &s;ett of excu&s;es, enough to &s;erve on all occa&s;ions: for in&s;tance, your uncle came four|&s;core miles to town this morning on purpo&s;e to &s;ee you, and goes back by break of day to-morrow; a brother-&s;ervant, that borrowed money of you when he was out of place, was run|ning away to Ireland; you were taking leave of an old fel|low-&s;ervant, who was &s;hipping for Barbadoes; your father &s;ent a cow to you to &s;ell, and you could not get a chapman till nine at night; you were taking leave of a dear cou&s;in, who is to be hanged next Saturday; you wrenched your foot again&s;t a &s;tone, and were forced to &s;tay three hours in a &s;hop, before you could &s;tir a &s;tep; &s;ome na&s;tine&s;s was thrown on you out of a garret-window, and you were a&s;hamed to come home before you were cleaned, and the &s;mell went off; you were pre&s;&s;ed for the &s;ea-&s;ervice, and carried before a ju&s;tice of peace, who kept you three hours before he examined you, and you got off with much ado; a bailiff by mi&s;take &s;eized you for a debtor, and kept you the whole evening in a &s;punging-hou&s;e: you were told your ma&s;ter had gone to a tavern, and came to &s;ome mi&s;chance, and your grief was &s;o great that you enquired for his honour in an hundred taverns between Pall Mall and Temple Bar.</P>
<P>Take all trade&s;men's parts again&s;t your ma&s;ter; and when you are &s;ent to buy any thing, never offer to cheapen it, but generou&s;ly pay the full demand. This is highly to your ma&s;ter's honour; and may be &s;ome &s;hillings in your pocket; and you are to con&s;ider, if your ma&s;ter hath paid too much, he can better afford the lo&s;s than a poor trade&s;man.</P>
<P>Never &s;ubmit to &s;tir a finger in any bu&s;ine&s;s, but that for which you was particularly hired. For example, if the groom be drunk, or ab&s;ent, and the butler be ordered to &s;hut the &s;table door, the an&s;wer is ready, "An plea&s;e your honour, I
<PB N="13" REF="15">don't under&s;tand hor&s;es:" If a corner of the hanging wants a &s;ingle nail to fa&s;ten it, and the footman be directed to tack it up, he may &s;ay he doth not under&s;tand that &s;ort of work, but his honour may &s;end for the uphol&s;terer.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ters and ladies are u&s;ually quarrelling with the &s;ervants for not &s;hutting the doors after them: for neither ma&s;ters nor ladies con&s;ider, that tho&s;e doors mu&s;t be open before they can be &s;hut, and that the labour is double to open and &s;hut the doors; therefore the be&s;t, the &s;horte&s;t, and ea&s;ie&s;t way, is to do neither. But if you are &s;o often teazed to &s;hut the door, that you cannot ea&s;ily forget it, then give the door &s;uch a clap as you go out, as will &s;hake the whole room, and make every thing rattle in it, to put your ma&s;ter and lady in mind that you ob&s;erve their directions.</P>
<P>If you find your&s;elf to grow into favour with your ma&s;ter or lady, take &s;ome opportunity, in a very mild way, to give them warning; and when they a&s;k the rea&s;on, and &s;eem loth to part with you, an&s;wer that you would rather live with them than any body el&s;e, but a poor &s;ervant is not to be blamed if he &s;trives to better him&s;elf; that &s;ervice is no inheritance; that your work is great, and your wages very &s;mall. Upon which, if your ma&s;ter hath any genero&s;ity, he will add five or ten &s;hil|lings a quarter rather than let you go; but if you are baulked, and have no mind to go off, get &s;ome fellow-&s;ervant to tell your ma&s;ter that he hath prevailed upon you to &s;tay.</P>
<P>Whatever good bits you can pilfer in the day, &s;ave them to junket with your fellow-&s;ervants at night; and take in the butler, provided he will give you drink.</P>
<P>Write your own name, and your &s;weetheart's, with the &s;moak of a candle, on the roof of the kitchen, or the &s;ervants-hall, to &s;hew your learning.</P>
<P>If you are a young &s;ightly fellow, whenever you whi&s;per your mi&s;tre&s;s at the table, run your no&s;e full in her cheek; or, if your breath be good, breathe full in her face: this I have known to have had very good con&s;equences in &s;ome families.</P>
<P>Never come till you have been called three or four times; for none but dogs will come at the fir&s;t whi&s;tle: and when the ma&s;ter calls, "Who's there?" no &s;ervant is bound to come; for Who's There is nobody's name.</P>
<P>When you have broken all your earthen drinking ve&s;&s;els below &s;tairs, (which is u&s;ually done in a week) the copper|pot will do as well; it can boil milk, heat porridge, hold &s;mall-beer, or in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity &s;erve for a jordan: therefore apply it indifferently to all the&s;e u&s;es; but never wa&s;h or &s;cour it, for fear of taking off the tin.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">Although you are allowed knives for the &s;ervants-hall at meals, yet you ought to &s;pare them, and make u&s;e only of your ma&s;ter's.</P>
<P>Let it be a con&s;tant rule, that no chair, &s;tool, or table, in the &s;ervants-hall, or the kitchen, &s;hall have above three legs, which hath been the ancient and con&s;tant practice in all the families I ever knew, and is &s;aid to be founded upon two rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, to &s;hew that &s;ervants are ever in a tottering condition; &s;econdly, it was thought a point of humility, that the &s;ervants chairs and tables &s;hould have at lea&s;t one leg fewer than tho&s;e of their ma&s;ters. I grant there hath been an exception to this rule with regard to the cook, who by old cu&s;tom was allowed an ea&s;y-chair to &s;leep in after dinner; and yet I have &s;eldom &s;een them with above three legs. Now this epidemical lamene&s;s of &s;ervants chairs is by philo&s;ophers im|puted to two cau&s;es, which are ob&s;erved to make the greate&s;t revolutions in &s;tates and empires; I mean, love and war. A &s;tool, a chair, or a table, is the fir&s;t weapon taken up in a general romping or &s;kirmi&s;h; and after a peace, the chairs, if they be not very &s;trong, are apt to &s;uffer in the conduct of an amour, the cook being u&s;ually fat and heavy, and the butler a little in drink.</P>
<P>I could never enduce to &s;ee maid-&s;ervants &s;o ungenteel as to walk the &s;treets with their petticoats pinned up; it is a fooli&s;h excu&s;e, to alledge their-petticoats will be dirty, when they have &s;o ea&s;y a remedy as to walk three or four times down a clean pair of &s;tairs after they come home.</P>
<P>When you &s;top to tattle with &s;ome crony &s;ervant in the &s;ame &s;treet, leave your own &s;treet-door open, that you may get in without knocking when you come back; otherwi&s;e your mi&s;tre&s;s may know you are gone out, and you mu&s;t be chidden.</P>
<P>I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly exhort you all to unanimity and con|cord; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;take me not; you may quarrel with each other as much as you plea&s;e, only always bear in mind, that you have a common enemy, which is your ma&s;ter and lady, and you have a common cau&s;e to defend. Believe an old practitioner; whoever, out of malice to a fellow-&s;ervant, carries a tale to his ma&s;ter, &s;hall be ruined by a general confederacy again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The general place of rendezvous for all the &s;ervants, both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> winter and &s;ummer, is the kitchen; there the grand affairs of the family ought to be con&s;ulted; whether they concern the &s;table, the dairy, the pantry, the laundry, the cellar, the nur&s;ery, the dining-room, or my lady's chamber: there, as in your own proper element, you can laugh, and &s;quall, and romp, in full &s;ecurity.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">When any &s;ervant comes home drunk, and cannot appear, you mu&s;t all join in telling your ma&s;ter, that he is gone to bed &s;ick; upon which your lady will be &s;o good-natured as to order &s;ome comfortable thing for the poor man or maid.</P>
<P>When your ma&s;ter or lady go abroad together to dinner, or on a vi&s;it for the evening, you need leave only one &s;ervant in the hou&s;e, unle&s;s you have a black-guard boy to an&s;wer at the door, and attend the children, if there be any. Who is to &s;tay at home is to be determined by &s;hort and long cuts, and the &s;tayer at home may be comforted by a vi&s;it from a &s;weet|heart, without danger of being caught together. The&s;e op|portunities mu&s;t never be mi&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e they come but &s;ome|times; and all is &s;afe enough while there is a &s;ervant in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When your ma&s;ter or lady comes home, and wants a &s;er|vant who happens to be abroad, your an&s;wer mu&s;t be, that he had but ju&s;t that minute &s;tept out, being &s;ent for by a cou&s;in who was dying.</P>
<P>If your ma&s;ter calls you by name, and you happen to an&s;wer at the fourth call, you need not hurry your&s;elf; and if you be chidden for &s;taying, you may lawfully &s;ay, you came no &s;ooner becau&s;e you did not know what you were called for.</P>
<P>When you are chidden for a fault, as you go out of the room and down &s;tairs, mutter loud enough to be plainly heard; this will make him believe you are innocent.</P>
<P>Whoever comes to vi&s;it your ma&s;ter or lady when they are abroad, never burden your memory with the per&s;on's name, for indeed you have too many other things to remember: be|&s;ides, it is a porter's bu&s;ine&s;s, and your ma&s;ter's fault he does not keep one, and who can remember names? and you will certainly mi&s;take them, and you can neither write nor read.</P>
<P>If it be po&s;&s;ible, never tell a lye to your ma&s;ter or lady, un|le&s;s you have &s;ome hopes that they cannot find it out in le&s;s than half an hour. When a &s;ervant is turned off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll his faults mu&s;t be told, although mo&s;t of them were never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">own by his ma&s;ter or lady; and all mi&s;chiefs done by others charge to him. [In&s;tance them.] And when they a&s;k any of you, why you never acquainted them before? the an&s;wer is, "Sir," or "Madam, really I was afraid it would make you angry; and be&s;ides, perhaps, you might think it was malice in me." Where there are little ma&s;ters and mi&s;&s;es in a hou&s;e, they are u&s;ually great impediments to the diver&s;ions of the &s;ervants; the only remedy is to bride them with Goody Goodies, that they may not tell tales to papa and mamma.</P>
<P>I advi&s;e you of the &s;ervant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, who&s;e ma&s;ters live in the country, and who expect vales, always to &s;tand rank and file
<PB N="16" REF="18">when a &s;tranger is taking his leave; &s;o that he mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity pa&s;s between you, and he mu&s;t have more confidence, or le&s;s money than u&s;ual, if any of you let him e&s;cape; and ac|cording as he behaves him&s;elf, remember to treat him the next time he comes.</P>
<P>If you are &s;ent with ready-money to buy any thing at a &s;hop, and happen at that time to be out of pocket, &s;ink the money, and take up the goods on your ma&s;ter's account. This is for the honour of your ma&s;ter and your&s;elf; for he becomes a man of credit at your recommendation.</P>
<P>When your lady &s;ends for you up to her chamber to give you any orders, be &s;ure to &s;tand at the door, and keep it open, fiddling with the lock all the while &s;he is talking to you, and keep the button in your hand, for fear you &s;hould forget to &s;hut the door after you.</P>
<P>If your ma&s;ter or lady happen once in their lives to accu&s;e you wrongfully, you are a happy &s;ervant; for you have no|thing more to do, than for every fault you commit while you are in their &s;ervice to put them in mind of that fal&s;e accu&s;ation, and prote&s;t your&s;elf equally innocent in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>When you have a mind to leave your ma&s;ter, and are too ba&s;hful to break the matter for fear of offending him, the be&s;t way is to grow rude and &s;aucy of a &s;udden, and beyond your u&s;ual behaviour, till he finds it nece&s;&s;ary to turn you off; and when you are gone, to revenge your&s;elf, give him and his lady &s;uch a character to all your brother &s;ervants who are out of place, that none will venture to offer their &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Some nice ladies, who are afraid of catching cold, having ob&s;erved that the maids and fellows below-&s;tairs often forget to &s;hut the door after them, as they come in, or go out into the back-yards, have contrived that a pulley and a rope, with a large piece of lead at the end, &s;hould be &s;o fixed, as to make the door &s;hut of it&s;elf, and require a &s;trong hand to open it, which is an immen&s;e toil to &s;ervants, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s may force them to go in and out fifty times in a morning: but ingenuity can do much; for prudent &s;ervants have found out an effectual remedy again&s;t this in&s;upportable grievance, by tying up the pulley in &s;uch a manner, that the weight of lead &s;hall have no effect; however, as to my own part, I would rather chu&s;e to keep the door always open by laying a heavy &s;tone at the bot|tom of it.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants candle&s;ticks are generally broken, for nothing can la&s;t for ever. But you may find out many expedients; you may conveniently &s;tick your candle in a bottle, or with a lump of butter again&s;t the wain&s;cot, in a powder-horn, or in an old &s;hoe, or in a cleft-&s;tick, or in the barrel of a pi&s;tol,
<PB N="17" REF="19">or upon it's own grea&s;e on a table, in a coffee-cup, or a drink|ing gla&s;s, a horn-cann, a tea-pot, a twi&s;ted napkin, a mu&s;tard-pot, an inkhorn, a marrow-bone, a piece of dough, or you may cut a hole in the loaf and &s;tick it there.</P>
<P>When you invi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the neighbouring &s;ervants to junket with you at home in an evening, teach them a peculiar way of tap|ping or &s;craping at the kitchen-window, which you may hear, but not your ma&s;ter or lady, whom you mu&s;t take care not to di&s;turb or frighten at &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable hours.</P>
<P>Lay all faults upon a lap-dog, or favourite cat, a monkey, a parrot, a child, or on the &s;ervant who was la&s;t turned off; by this rule you will excu&s;e your&s;elf, do no hurt to any body el&s;e, and &s;ave your ma&s;ter or lady from the trouble and vexation of chiding.</P>
<P>When you want proper in&s;truments for any work you are about, u&s;e all expedients you can invent, rather than leave your work undone. For in&s;tance, if the poker be out of the way, or broken, &s;tir the fire with the tongs; if the tongs be not at hand, u&s;e the muzzle of the bellows, the wrong end of the fire-&s;hovel, the handle of the fire-bru&s;h, the end of a mop, or your ma&s;ter's cane. If you want paper to &s;inge a fowl, tear the fir&s;t book you &s;ee about the hou&s;e. Wipe your &s;hoes, for want of a clout, with the bottom of a curtain, or a dama&s;k napkin. Strip your livery-lace for garters. If the butler wants a jordan, he may u&s;e the great &s;ilver cup.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal ways of putting out candles, and you ought to be in&s;tructed in them all: you may run the candle-end again&s;t the wain&s;cot, which puts the &s;nuff out immediate|ly; you may lay it on the ground, and tread the &s;nuff out with your foot; you may hold it up&s;ide-down, until it is choaked with it's own grea&s;e; or cram it into the &s;ocket of the candle&s;tick; you may whirl it round in your hand till it goes out; when you go to bed, after you have made water, you may dip the candle-end into the chamber-pot; you may &s;pit on your finger and thumb, and pinch the &s;nuff till it goes out. The cook may run the candle's no&s;e into the meal-tub, or the groom into a ve&s;&s;el of oats, or a lock of hay, or a heap of litter; the hou&s;e-maid may put out her candle by running it again&s;t a looking-gla&s;s, which nothing cleans &s;o well as candle-&s;nuff; but the quicke&s;t and be&s;t of all methods is, to blow it out with your breath, which leaves the candle clear, and readier to be lighted.</P>
<P>There is nothing &s;o pernicious in a family as a tell-tale, again&s;t whom it mu&s;t be the principal bu&s;ine&s;s of you all to unite: whatever office he &s;erves in, take all opportunities to &s;poil the bu&s;ine&s;s he is about, and to cro&s;s him in every thing.
<PB N="18" REF="20">For in&s;tance, if the butler be a tell-tale, break his gla&s;&s;es when|ever he leaves the pantry-door open; or lock the cat or the ma&s;tiff in it, who will do as well; or mi&s;lay a fork or a &s;poon, &s;o as he may never find it. If it be the cook, whenever &s;he turns her back, throw a lump of &s;oot, or a handful of &s;alt, in the pot, or &s;moaking coals into the dripping-pan, or daub the roa&s;t-meat with the back of the chimney, or hide the key of the jack. If a footman be &s;u&s;pected, let the cook daub the back of his new livery; or when he is going up with a di&s;h of &s;oup, let her follow him &s;oftly with a ladle-full, and dribble it all the way up &s;tairs to the dining-room, and then let the hou&s;e-maid make &s;uch a noi&s;e that her lady may hear it. The waiting-maid is very likely to be guilty of this fault in hopes to ingratiate her&s;elf: in this ca&s;e, the laundre&s;s mu&s;t be &s;ure to tear her &s;mocks in the wa&s;hing, and yet wa&s;h them but half; and, when &s;he complains, tell all the hou&s;e that &s;he &s;weats &s;o much, and her fle&s;h is &s;o na&s;ty, that &s;he &s;ouls a &s;mock more in one hour, than the kitchen-maid doth in a week.</P>

<HEAD>SPEECH OF LAWYER BRIEF.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS, AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE are a &s;et of men in the world, of &s;uch a tedious, tire&s;ome, trifling, trouble&s;ome habitude, temper, and di&s;po&s;ition of mind, that they perplex, confound, entangle, and puzzle, every circum&s;tance in every cau&s;e which they under|take, protect, defend, and ju&s;tify. In&s;tead of coming to the point, matter, bu&s;ine&s;s, or debate, they deviate, vary, waver, and fly off therefrom. When we expect truth, &s;atisfaction, conviction, and deci&s;ion, we find, perceive, ob&s;erve, and re|mark, nothing but uncertainty, ambiguity, doubtfulne&s;s, and difficulty. This, my lord, I humbly apprehend, conceive, think, pre&s;ume, and furmi&s;e, is owing to tediou&s;ne&s;s and pro|lixity; the nature, genius, and extent of which, I &s;hall con|&s;ider, weigh, examine, explicate, and &s;crutinize. In the fir&s;t place, then, I &s;hall &s;hew, prove, and demon&s;trate, the nature of tediou&s;ne&s;s and prolixity, by &s;hewing, proving, and demon|&s;trating, that there is nothing &s;o unnatural; for the bu&s;ine&s;s of a tongue, utterance, &s;peech, or language, is to come to the point, argument, contemplation, or que&s;tion, at once, point-blank, &s;lap-da&s;h, and conci&s;ely, without any prevarication, equi|vocation, retardation, or circumbendibus what&s;oever. And now, in the &s;econd, &s;ucceeding, following place, point, and preliminary, I come to promulgate the genius of tediou&s;ne&s;s and prolixity; which is done, effected, performed, and brought about, by mani&s;e&s;ting that they have no genius at all: and &s;o
<PB N="19" REF="21">far from any men of genius making u&s;e of them, none but your egregious, ab&s;urd, ridiculous dolts, dunderheads, and block|heads, ever admit, acknowledge, receive, or embrace, any &s;uch notions, ideas, maxims, principles, or tenets. Thirdly, my lord, I beg leave, according to order, form, &s;eries, and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, to animadvert upon the extent of tediou&s;ne&s;s and pro|lixity; and this is managed by demon&s;trating that it is infinite and without bounds, and con&s;equently can have no extent at all. And now, my lord, I will open the cau&s;e, &s;pring, origin, fountain, ri&s;e, and foundation, of the&s;e vices, which is Tauto|logy; which is the &s;peaking, &s;aying, delivering, uttering, pro|nouncing, divulging, declaring, remarking, ob&s;erving, repeat|ing, or expre&s;&s;ing, the &s;ame identical, individual thing, an hun|dred, and an hundred, and an hundred, and an hundred, and an hundred hundred hundred times over. And now, my lord, I beg leave, pardon, permi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ufferance, to lay down only &s;ix and fifty particulars: every particular, my lord, &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of only &s;eventy-two divi&s;ions; every divi&s;ion &s;hall comprehend, contain, and con&s;i&s;t of only eighty-two &s;ub-divi&s;ions; every &s;ub-divi&s;ion &s;hall be concluded with the &s;ix and fortieth article; and every article &s;hall con&s;ume, expend, and co&s;t, no more than an hour and an half.</P>

<HEAD>PLATE II. THE INDUSTRIOUS 'PRENTICE PERFORMING THE DUTY OF A CHRISTIAN.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH this print may &s;eem, to a cur&s;ory ob&s;erver, le&s;s &s;triking and important than any of the whole &s;eries, it is in fact of the very fir&s;t con&s;equence. It is, by attending the publick wor&s;hip of the Supreme Being, with becoming piety, that virtue is &s;trengthened; and it is by the neglect of this duty, that vice gains ground of it's victim. From this &s;cene Tom Idle is excluded. With him it was no favourite place; for, during the hours of devotion, it will in the next print be &s;een that he was far differently employed.</P>
<P>The indu&s;trious youth, Francis Goodchild, is in this print repre&s;ented at Spitalfields church, a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the performance of divine wor&s;hip; and he is honoured with the company of Mi&s;s We&s;t, his ma&s;ter's daughter, in the &s;ame pew, to whom his features bear a not very di&s;tant re&s;emblance. They have both a &s;weet placidity of countenance. Piety and &s;implicity are manife&s;t in their deportment; and they &s;eem, at fir&s;t &s;ight, evidently made for each other.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;olemnity of the place, Hogarth has contrived to give us &s;ome ludicrous figures, without any vio|lent departure from nature. The fat grote&s;que female in the upper corner; the man near her, accompanying the organ with his deep-toned vocal exertions; and him beneath, "be|tween &s;leeping and waking," who joins in the &s;onorous chorus;
<PB REF="29">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="26" REF="31">are all, though ludicrous, &s;uch characters as every &s;pectator mu&s;t recognize. The pew-opener, with her keys, is al&s;o hap|pily &s;ketched, aiding the &s;olemn vociferations.</P>
<P>The rules of per&s;pective are, in this print, purpo&s;ely violated, to give an idea of a crouded congregation; but the figures, in general, are &s;o minute, that their merits are imperceptible. Where they are vi&s;ible, character is to be traced in each.</P>
<P>On a &s;light examination of this print, we felt a little in|clined to cen&s;ure Hogarth for neglecting to pre&s;ent us with the worthy Mr. We&s;t attending divine wor&s;hip with his family, and thus &s;trengthening the moral effect. But we &s;oon di&s;|covered that this, far from being an error, was a merit beyond vulgar view, &s;ince the ab&s;ence of the ma&s;ter the better ac|counts for that of his vicious apprentice.</P>
<P>The motto of this print is from the Royal P&s;almi&s;t.</P>

<P>TO be, or not to be&mdash;a Taylor? That is the que&s;tion.

Forbid it, Heaven! I am a man; and a man of con&s;equence too, for no man is a man without me.

Yes! law, divinity, and phy&s;ick too, all &s;tand indebted to me for their impor|tance: I am, therefore, not only a man, but a man of im|portance. What would our &s;ailors do, tho&s;e brave fellows to whom we chiefly owe the &s;afety of our country it&s;elf, with|out jackets and trow&s;ers? why, they would be as bare-bottomed as &s;o many Moun&s;eers, and then we &s;hould &s;ee that they had no more bottom neither.

A taylor, then, is not only a man, but a man of valour, &s;ince he trims them all. At court, who would be introduced into the royal pre&s;ence, without my preparing them for a good reception? Does it &s;ignify one far|thing what is within, provided as how I have the management of the out&s;ide. In courting, too, as well as at court, are not ninety-nine women out of every hundred, more governed in their choice by my part of the object, than any other con&s;ider|ation whatever. "A good <HI>coat,</HI>" as the old &s;ong <HI>&s;hould</HI> &s;ay, "and a light pair of breeches, go through the world." If a man has no credit with his taylor, he has none el&s;ewhere; nobody will admit a man of merit out at elbows into his hou&s;e; no|body will &s;peak to genius cloathed with rags in the &s;treet. But let me have the dre&s;&s;ing of the vile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t ra&s;cal in the univer&s;e, and &s;ee if he is not welcomed like a prince in every fa&s;hionable circle. Is it not dre&s;s that makes him a gentleman? Is it not me that regulates the fa&s;hions? I, therefore, mu&s;t be a gentleman, as well as a man of fa&s;hion. Can any man, who is not well cloathed by me, cloath the be&s;t &s;tory in the world &s;o as to be reckoned wit in polite company? And will not the mo&s;t threadbare joke, uttered by one whom I have thus qualified, convul&s;e the very &s;ame circle with laughter. I am, therefore, the maker of wit; and mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be a man of wit. Shall I, then, who can do all the&s;e great things, be ca&s;t off, and de&s;pi&s;ed, like an old garment, the in&s;tant I quit my &s;hop-board? Shall I, who am not only a man, but a man of con&s;equence; not only a man of con&s;equence, but a man of importance; not only a man of importance, but a man of va|lour; not only a man of valour, but a gentleman; not only a gentleman, but a man of wit; be bawled after, by every &s;habby, ragged ra&s;cal, whenever I fetch a walk with Mrs. Snip, my daughter Dolly, or &s;ome favourite girl&mdash;"Look! there goes Snip, the taylor; the ninth part of a man!" and, when I mount my nag, ju&s;t to take an airing in the du&s;t of Hyde Park, like my cu&s;tomers, &s;ee every one turning &s;inger-po&s;t, and hear them cry, "Twig the taylor riding to Brentford!" while a wag &s;lily contrives to make a &s;lip of paper re&s;embling a mea&s;ure dangle from my pocket? Shall I, who know &s;o well how to live, and how to live well too, be thus made weary of my life, or even of my livelihood, by a &s;et of ragamu&s;&s;ios? Poets and philo&s;ophers prate that a bare bodkin will <HI>quiet us;</HI> a bare breech! I was going to &s;ay. It might quiet us, but would it quiet the devil? He, I am told, will not be cheated out of his own, like a poor taylor by his bad cu&s;tomers: and I &s;hould
<PB N="28" REF="33">chu&s;e, &s;ince I am obliged to give long credit, to have as long allowed me as po&s;&s;ible. They may talk of &s;huffling off life, but I had rather &s;huffle through life. Con&s;cience, they &s;ay, makes cowards of us all: but a taylor has no con&s;cience; ergo, a taylor is no coward. Shall I, who am a man of &s;o many functions, &s;ubmit to be thus treated, without reply? No if they could cut me as &s;mall as cabbage, put me in the fire like my goo&s;e, freeze me into the coldne&s;s of my favourite cu|cumbers, or &s;end me to hell it&s;elf, I will &s;peak&mdash;while I am a man.

<HEAD>HUMOROUS ESSAY ON ERRORS OF THE PRESS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ORIGINALLY SENT TO A MORNING PAPER.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY CALEB WHITEFOORD, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. EDITOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE you and your corre&s;pondents are &s;o laudably employed in watching over the welfare of the &s;tate, keeping a jealous eye on our mini&s;ters, and pointing out the <HI>errors</HI> of government, I wi&s;h, (if you could but find time for it) that you would pay &s;ome little attention to your own <HI>errors.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps it will appear the highe&s;t degree of pre&s;umption to offer advice to a per&s;on in <HI>your</HI> eminent &s;tation; <HI>one</HI> who every day (Sundays excepted) dictates to mini&s;ters, and coun&s;els kings; <HI>one</HI> who is read and admired in every part of the Briti&s;h dominions.</P>
<P>It is for this very rea&s;on, Sir, that I think it incumbent on me to tell you of your <HI>mi&s;takes;</HI> for you cannot &s;ay with <HI>Job,</HI> <Q><HI>Albeit that I have erred, mine</HI> ERROR <HI>remaineth with</HI> MY|SELF.</Q> No, Mr. Editor, <HI>your</HI> errors circulate far and wide; they mi&s;repre&s;ent many, and mi&s;lead more; in &s;hort, the errors I mean, are <HI>errors of the pre&s;s,</HI> or, as my <HI>learned</HI> friend <HI>Sir James Hodges</HI> expre&s;&s;es them, in <HI>one</HI> Engli&s;h-Latin-&s;ingular-plural word, <HI>erratums.</HI></P>
<P>Of all errata, the mo&s;t <HI>harmle&s;s</HI> are tho&s;e which make &s;tark|&s;taring <HI>non&s;en&s;e.</HI> The&s;e are never imputed to the writer, but are corrected by the reader, in his own mind, as he goes along; but the <HI>dangerous</HI> ones are tho&s;e which make a kind of half-&s;en&s;e, and pa&s;s current as the &s;en&s;e of the <HI>author,</HI> until the
<PB N="29" REF="34">day following, when your li&s;t of errata transfers the blame from the writer to the printer. However, I mu&s;t &s;ay that printers (with all their profe&s;&s;ions of candour) are as little apt to acknowledge <HI>their</HI> errors as the re&s;t of mankind: for not one erratum in ten is ever acknowledged; and, indeed, I &s;up|po&s;e they very &s;eldom would, unle&s;s at the particular de&s;ire of the writer.</P>
<P>As I have &s;aid much about the <HI>errors of the pre&s;s,</HI> it may naturally be expected that I &s;hould produce &s;ome proofs of what I have a&s;&s;erted. This I am enabled to do, having paid particular attention to them for &s;ome time pa&s;t, and having looked more &s;harply after them, than the promotions civil or military, the prices of corn or of &s;tocks, the li&s;t of &s;hips or bankrupts, or of tho&s;e paragraphs which inform who is dead, who is married, or who is hanged.</P>
<P>But now for the particulars of the charge&mdash;I have known you throw an injurious reflection on all the crowned heads in Europe at one &s;troke; for, in&s;tead of <HI>potentates,</HI> you have called them <HI>potatoes,</HI> as if they had been <HI>mere vegetables.</HI> As to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, you talk of <HI>him</HI> in a different &s;tile; for, in|&s;tead of the <HI>Hero</HI> of Pru&s;&s;ia, you have made him the <HI>Nero.</HI> Next day comes your apology, or <HI>erratum,</HI> which &s;ometimes, in&s;tead of mending matters, makes things wor&s;e; and, like an arch-tinker, in &s;topping one hole makes two: as, I remember, my old friend Alderman Faulkner of Dublin, corrected an error in <HI>his</HI> Journal, "Erratum in our la&s;t, for <HI>his</HI> Grace the <HI>Dutche&s;s</HI> of Dor&s;et, read <HI>her</HI> Grace the <HI>Duke</HI> of Dor&s;et." Indeed, a blunder &s;eems to be &s;omething of the nature of a <HI>bog.</HI> the more you &s;truggle, the deeper you get into it. But, to proceed. You have, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, u&s;ed the <HI>Doge</HI> of Genoa extremely ill, and never have made him the lea&s;t apo|logy for omitting the la&s;t letter in his title; though, if you <HI>had</HI> de&s;ired your readers, next day, in&s;tead of <HI>Dog</HI> to read <HI>Doge,</HI> I do confe&s;s that it would have been no great reparation.</P>
<P>I remember the Iri&s;h parliament, &s;ome time ago, were of|fended at &s;omething in your paper; and took up the matter &s;o <HI>warmly,</HI> that they ordered the paper to be burnt. Now, whe|ther <HI>you,</HI> Mr. Editor, have taken umbrage al&s;o and like-<HI>wi&s;e,</HI> or whether it proceeds from negligence, I know not; but cer|tain it is, that &s;everal unlucky mi&s;takes have happened relative to that re&s;pectable body. At their fir&s;t meeting, you told us, (in&s;tead of a <HI>bili</HI>) that a motion would be made for leave to bringin a <HI>bull;</HI> and, afterwards, another motion, that the or|der of the <HI>Dey</HI> be read, as if it was an a&s;&s;embly on the coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary</HI>&mdash;You told us, one day, that <HI>Lord</HI>&mdash;, of the kingdom of Ireland, had been &s;afely delivered of a daughter;
<PB N="30" REF="35">and we were all very anxious on my lord's account, till the day following, when you delivered his lord&s;hip of the burden, and brought the child into the world a more natural way.</P>
<P>In a late &s;cuffle under the Piazza, Covent Garden, you in|formed us that an Iri&s;h officer had got a <HI>confu&s;ion</HI> in his head; and you made no apology afterwards, thinking, I &s;uppo&s;e, there was no occa&s;ion for any, as you were right to a <HI>t.</HI></P>
<P>Not long ago you adverti&s;ed a &s;peedy cure for <HI>raptures;</HI> and I am afraid it gave &s;ome wicked batchelor occa&s;ion to &s;coff at the holy &s;tate of matrimony; for, as the devil would have it, (I mean one of <HI>your</HI> devils) the very next adverti&s;ement to it was from a gentleman who wanted a wife, and over it was printed MATRIMONY in capitals; con&s;equently, it appeared, that <HI>matrimony</HI> was the mo&s;t &s;peedy and effectual cure for <HI>raptures,</HI> though of ever &s;o long &s;tanding, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have known you adverti&s;e, in&s;tead of a <HI>never</HI>-failing re|medy, an <HI>ever</HI>-failing remedy: now, Sir, though this might be &s;trictly true, "yet I hold it not proper that it &s;hould be &s;o &s;et down," as I &s;uppo&s;e the quack-doctor paid you his money for conveying a very different &s;en&s;e to the publick. In a receipt lately publi&s;hed for the cure of the plague, in&s;tead of <HI>rue,</HI> you put <HI>rice;</HI> and &s;o made a <HI>pudding</HI> of it; and in adver|ti&s;ing a cour&s;e of lectures, you turned a <HI>&s;yllabus</HI> into a <HI>&s;yllabub;</HI> and called the perpetual <HI>motion</HI> a perpetual <HI>notion.</HI></P>
<P>I wi&s;h you would be a little more cautious in adverti&s;ing <HI>Salivation not nece&s;&s;ary;</HI> for it happened, by omitting the <HI>i</HI> in &s;alivation, you gave great offence to &s;ome very good chri&s;tians in my neigbourhood; and al&s;o gave occa&s;ion to &s;ome wicked <HI>pun&s;ters</HI> to ob&s;erve, that it was not the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> time an <HI>eye</HI> had been lo&s;t in &s;alivation; nay, that &s;ome people had been &s;o un|lucky as to lo&s;e a <HI>couple.</HI></P>
<P>There is another adverti&s;ement which frequently occurs, beginning with&mdash;<HI>"Whereas &s;everal evil-minded per&s;ons, &amp;c."</HI> &mdash;One day you made it evil-minded <HI>par&s;ons,</HI> which was ex|tremely unlucky; for, in the&s;e times of <HI>infidelity,</HI> people are too apt to &s;coff at the clergy, and indeed at all &s;erious &s;ubjects: as to my&s;elf, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I am particularly hurt at tho&s;e <HI>impertinent levities</HI> with which &s;ome people indulge them&s;elves, being a per&s;on of a &s;erious turn of mind, and of a di&s;po&s;ition rather &s;aturnine and grave.</P>
<P>It too often happens, Mr. Editor, that "what &s;hould be <HI>grave</HI> you turn to <HI>farce.</HI>" I remember, in your paper, a &s;en|&s;ible pathetick letter, &s;igned a <HI>Citizen;</HI> he laments the <HI>internal</HI> &s;tate of this country, and <HI>you</HI> made it the <HI>infernal</HI> &s;tate; when he exclaimed, &s;ad <HI>rever&s;e!</HI> you made him cry our, &s;ad <HI>reverie:</HI> he di&s;approved of all <HI>national</HI> reflections, you made him di&s;ap|prove
<PB N="31" REF="36">of all <HI>rational</HI> reflections; and, talking of the <HI>fate</HI> of empires, you made him &s;ay the <HI>fat</HI> of empires. Now, as there are &s;o many &s;tanding jokes about citizens being fond of <HI>fat</HI>&mdash; whether turtle fat or veni&s;on fat&mdash;this unlucky mi&s;take quite &s;poiled the letter, di&s;obliged my friend the <HI>Citizen,</HI> and "all the fat was in the fire." And here I cannot help taking notice of a paragraph &s;ome time &s;ince, containing an account of the election of a a worthy alderman for a certain ward, when in|&s;tead of &s;aying he was <HI>duly</HI> elected, you &s;ay he was <HI>dully</HI> elected, and thereby afforded a handle for breaking &s;ome common|place je&s;ts on that re&s;pectable body of men the Court of Alder|men. Another time, in the account of an entertainment given by a worthy alderman to the deputy and common-coun|cil of his ward, where they <HI>dined</HI> on the turtle, you &s;aid they <HI>died</HI> on the turtle; as if they had all eat till they choaked or bur&s;t; whereas, on the contrary, it was extremely remarkable, that none either over-eat them&s;elves, or caught a &s;urfeit that day.</P>
<P>From &s;everal articles, Mr. Editor, one would be apt to con|clude, that you were no great <HI>geographer;</HI> for you tell us of cor&s;airs fitted out from <HI>Turin,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Tunis;</HI> and that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> had revolted again&s;t the Spaniards, in&s;tead of the <HI>Chi|le&s;e:</HI> now, though the&s;e two nations are on different &s;ides of the globe, I &s;uppo&s;e you thought they were near neighbours, being within an <HI>ell</HI> of each other. La&s;t year, when the Ru&s;|&s;ian fleet took the I&s;le of <HI>Lemnos,</HI> you told us that part of the &s;quadron remained at the I&s;le of <HI>Candy,</HI> and the re&s;t were going to attack the I&s;le of <HI>Lemons:</HI> you &s;uppo&s;ed, no doubt, that <HI>Candy</HI> was a &s;ugar i&s;land, and that they were going to the I&s;le of <HI>Lemons</HI> for fruit, and &s;o between them to &s;upply the fleet&mdash; pro bono publico&mdash;with <HI>punch.</HI></P>
<P>You have &s;ometimes treated the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> very injuriou&s;ly, by calling them <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians;</HI> and one day you told us the com|bined armies of the Turks and Tartars (in&s;tead of a <HI>Kam</HI>) was commanded by a <HI>Ram;</HI> as if they had been a parcel of &s;heep: and when it was expected the two armies were coming to <HI>Action,</HI> you &s;aid they were coming to <HI>Acton;</HI> and, as there was a con&s;iderable fall of Stocks at that time, I have rea&s;on to think it was owing to the above report, or to &s;ome other equally alarming.</P>
<P>I trembled for you during the whole time of the congre&s;s at <HI>Fockzany;</HI> it is a tickli&s;h word in the hands of a carele&s;s com|po&s;itor, and one does not know what terrible work he might make of it. Apropos, it is not long &s;ince you adverti&s;ed a view of the canal of <HI>Venice,</HI> and you made it the canal of <HI>Ve|nus:</HI> and, in the account of a hou&s;ebreaking, in&s;tead of the
<PB N="32" REF="37">rogues broke in at the <HI>window,</HI> you &s;aid they broke in at the <HI>widow.</HI></P>
<P>When you informed us that a certain lady was gone to pa&s;s the holiday: at her country-&s;eat near <HI>Corydon,</HI> every reader &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;ome <HI>&s;candal</HI> was meant, till the next day, when we learned that there was no Corydon in the ca&s;e, and that her lady&s;hip was only gone to her country-&s;eat hear <HI>Croydon.</HI></P>
<P>One day you told us, that &s;ome Engli&s;h lord (who&s;e name I have forgot) was arrived at Naples with his <HI>tabor;</HI> travelling with a <HI>tabor</HI> &s;eemed to be an odd kind of conceit; but his lord|&s;hip <HI>(apparement)</HI> was &s;oud of mu&s;ick, though the tabor and pipe &s;eemed more adapted to a <HI>lugged bear</HI> than a lord on his travels: thus <HI>we</HI> rea&s;oned till the <HI>erratum</HI> of the next day de|&s;ired us, for <HI>tabor</HI> to read <HI>t&uuml;tor.</HI></P>
<P>If your compo&s;itors are bad geographers, they are at lea&s;t as bad <HI>arithmeticians:</HI> wherever &s;ums occur, they are &s;ure to make a bad <HI>figure.</HI> I remember, at difierent times la&s;t year, they made the <HI>compul&s;atory</HI> India loan 14,000, 140,000 and &s;ometimes 14,000,000: in &s;hort, they have no adequate ideas of figures; and as to <HI>cyphers,</HI> they con&s;ider them as <HI>mere no|things,</HI> and that adding or taking away two or three of them from a &s;um makes no difference at all.</P>
<P>I have known you turn a matter of <HI>bear&s;ay,</HI> into a matter of <HI>here&s;y; Damon,</HI> into a <HI>Daemon;</HI> a <HI>delicious</HI> girl into a <HI>deli|rious</HI> girl; the comick <HI>mu&s;e,</HI> into a comick <HI>mou&s;e;</HI> a Jewi&s;h <HI>Rabbi,</HI> into a Jewi&s;h <HI>Rabbit;</HI> and when a corre&s;pondent, la|menting the corruption of the times, exclaimed&mdash;<HI>"O Mores!"</HI> you made him cry&mdash;<HI>"O Mo&s;es!"</HI></P>
<P>You &s;hould con&s;ider, Mr. Editor, that there is a material difference between acting with the utmo&s;t <HI>lenity,</HI> and utmo&s;t <HI>Levity;</HI> between <HI>factious</HI> and <HI>facetious; fellow</HI> and <HI>felon; im|prudent</HI> and <HI>impudent; re&s;olution</HI> and <HI>revolution; Runney mead</HI> and <HI>running mad; loud profe&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>lewd profe&s;&s;ions; words</HI> and <HI>works; &s;ouring</HI> and <HI>roaring; Thavies Inn</HI> and <HI>Thieves Inn; minutes</HI> and <HI>minuets; rubies</HI> and <HI>bubbies;</HI> a <HI>tube</HI> and a <HI>tub;</HI> all of which words I have ob&s;erved you, Sir, at times, u&s;e <HI>indi&s;criminately.</HI></P>
<P>I know you will &s;ay, that people ought to con&s;ider the con&s;tant hurry which attends the publication of a daily paper; that your paper is in &s;o <HI>great</HI> reque&s;t, and people are &s;o eager to get it, <HI>"with all it's imperfections on it's head,"</HI> that you really have not time to be more correct. Ah, Mr. Editor! it would be well for mankind if reformation, like charity, were always to begin at <HI>home;</HI> and that people would try to mend <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> in&s;tead of be&s;towing &s;o much fruitle&s;s and thankle&s;s pains in admoni&s;hing their neighbours. You, Sir, have be|&s;towed
<PB N="33" REF="38">much time and labour, and oil, floods of ink, and reams of paper, in advi&s;ing mini&s;ters of &s;tate, and correcting the mea&s;ures of government; and, after all, I dare &s;ay <HI>you your&s;elf</HI> will allow that they are at this moment not one bit better or wi&s;er than when you fir&s;t undertook to mend them.</P>
<P>Therefore take an old man's advice; &s;et a pattern to thy brother editors; leave for a while the care of the &s;tate to tho&s;e who are <HI>paid</HI> for it&mdash;look at home; begin a reformation <HI>there,</HI> and <HI>"correct thy&s;elf for the example of others."</HI> I am,</P>

<HEAD>CURIOUS CRITIQUE ON ROUSSEAU, WITH A PROPHECY FOUND IN AN OLD MANUSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been remarked, that a bad book ought as much to be guarded again&s;t as a bad companion. There certainly is nothing more true, and yet the mo&s;t dangerous are daily pub|li&s;hed uncen&s;ured; and a mean, ignorant, and mercenary, or unprincipled publi&s;her, may &s;pead poi&s;on daily more detri|mental than ar&s;enick. Some books, like men, acquire great reputation by &s;ome brilliant points, while the general tendency, like the general character, is never inve&s;tigated.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="39">In no in&s;tance is this more remarkable than in the writings of the celebrated Rou&s;&s;eau. The annals of literature never ex|hibited to the world a more paradoxical, whim&s;ical, ingenious, eloquent, weak, and dangerous author.</P>
<P>This author's works have been much read, whi&s;e few have examined the truth of his pictures, or analized the con&s;i&s;tency or tendency of his doctrines. In the preface to his novel, he &s;ays&mdash;"Cha&s;te girls never read romances; and the girl who reads four pages of this is undone."</P>
<P>Yet no books are more called for at Circulating Libraries than romances, and none more than his. With &s;uch &s;enti|ments he gives his book to the world, and then pre&s;umes to write on education.</P>
<P>The following fragment, which I lately met with, &s;aid to be &s;ound among &s;ome old manu&s;cripts, it is believed, will convey, in a &s;trong and true light, what is &s;aid of his writings; and may, perhaps, lead &s;ome people to think when they read.</P>

<HEAD>HUMOROUS ANECDOTE OF HOGARTH AND A NOBLEMAN.</HEAD>
<P>IN the early part of Hogarth's life, a nobleman, who was uncommonly ugly and deformed, came to fit to him for his picture. It was executed with a &s;kill that did honour to the arti&s;t's abilities; but the likene&s;s was rigidly ob&s;erved, without even the nece&s;&s;ary attention to compliment or flattery. The peer, di&s;gu&s;ted at this counter-part of his dear &s;elf, never once thought of paying for a reflector that would only in&s;ult him with his deformities. Some time was &s;uffered to elap&s;e before the arti&s;t applied for his money; but afterwards many applications were made by him (who had then no need of a banker) for payment, without &s;ucce&s;s. The painter, how|ever,
<PB N="39" REF="44">at la&s;t hit upon an expedient, which he knew mu&s;t alarm the nobleman's pride, and by that means an&s;wer his purpo&s;e. It was couched in the following card&mdash;</P>
<P>"Mr. HOGARTH's dutiful re&s;pects to Lord &mdash;, finding that he does not mean to have the picture which was drawn for him, is informed again of Mr. Hogarth's nece&s;&s;ity for the money; if, therefore, his Lord&s;hip does not &s;end for it in three days, it will be di&s;po&s;ed of, with the addition of a tail, and &s;ome other little appendages, to Mr. Hare, the fa|mous wild-bea&s;t man; Mr. Hogarth having given that gen|tleman a conditional promi&s;e of it for an exhibition of pic|tures, on his Lord&s;hip's refu&s;al."</P>
<P>This intimation had the de&s;ired effect: the picture was &s;ent for home, and committed to the flames.</P>

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF A MOST AWEFUL CHANGE, IN A YOUNG LADY OF EIGHTEEN. ADDRESSED TO A FRIEND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall rouze your tendere&s;t feelings, when I inform you that you will no more behold the lovely and beloved Mi&s;s Single|hand. She departed her &s;tate of trial on Sunday la&s;t, in the eighteenth year of her age.</P>
<P>That which brought her to her pre&s;ent &s;ituation has long preyed on her vitals. On the day ju&s;t mentioned, the con|queror came with irre&s;i&s;tible authority, as a king of terrors indeed, but in his milde&s;t form, and laid his victorious hand on her about ten o'clock in the morning; from which time till night &s;he held a &s;tate of uncertain exi&s;tence: at la&s;t, about midnight, that amiable countenance, which u&s;ed to glow with &s;weet mode&s;ty, was &s;hrouded in darkne&s;s, and the &s;poiler tri|umphed over beauties which were once the de&s;ire or the envy of both &s;exes.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t attack of her di&s;order was at a review in the Park; where Colonel Scarlet, who&s;e manly and polite addre&s;s is &s;o well known, commanded the regiment near which &s;he &s;tood. A &s;weetly-painful palpitation on a &s;udden &s;eized her till then peaceful bo&s;om: but this gave her little alarm, ignorant as &s;he was of the nature of her malady, and by no means expect|ing the con&s;equences which it has now produced. When &s;he came home, &s;he felt anxiety and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s; yet it did not ap|pear that &s;he had caught cold. She was fond of &s;olitude, and
<PB N="40" REF="45">apt to tremble and change colour: &s;he complained, but that only when alone, of an unea&s;ine&s;s in her brea&s;t; was ob&s;erved to lean her cheek on her hand, and frequently to wipe the trickling tear which accompanied the involuntary half-broken &s;igh.</P>
<P>Some of her friends were apprehen&s;ive for her &s;en&s;es; and, indeed, &s;everal of her actions appeared de&s;titute of that pru|dence, good-&s;en&s;e, and gaiety, for which &s;he was before re|markable. To &s;tudy long at her looking-gla&s;s; to be angry with her head-dre&s;s; to talk to her&s;elf, like one delirious, of groves and fountains, &s;oldiers, parents, and wrinkled old age, with a thou&s;and other incoherent &s;ubjects; were circum&s;tances very &s;u&s;picious, indeed. But, whatever her di&s;order was, &s;he was very &s;hy of giving any intimation which might lead to a di&s;covery of it.</P>
<P>It is proper you &s;hould know, that Colonel Scarlet was by this time pretty intimate at her father's, and from him was learned what chiefly led her friends to a knowledge of her complaint. They endeavoured to admini&s;ter &s;uch remedies as were calculated to remove her di&s;ea&s;e, but in vain; it evi|dently increa&s;ed. A jaunt into the country, a round of ele|gant amu&s;ements, &s;olitude, or company, &s;eemed each to feed her complaint, rather than remove it. The attention of the colonel to her &s;ituation, at this time, was exceedingly diligent and tender; be profe&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t concern for her welfare, and intere&s;ted him&s;elf in all that was done for her: his coun|try-feat, his coach, and his fortune, were all at her &s;ervice; and he &s;eemed willing to give even him&s;elf for her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of things, and as the la&s;t re&s;ource&mdash;all other advice proving ineffectual&mdash;recour&s;e was had to a cler|gyman. He &s;poke to her very &s;eriou&s;ly concerning the change of &s;tate before her; enquired into the &s;ituation of her mind, with re&s;pect to the approaching awful period; informed her of the new birth to be expected, the remedy again&s;t &s;in, and the &s;ociety and comfort of the bli&s;sful man&s;ions, quoting &s;everal texts to the purpo&s;e. He gave her many &s;uitable exhortations to love her lord with all her heart, and obey his will; and di|rected her concerning the endowment of wordly goods, and &s;uch other &s;ubjects as are common on the&s;e occa&s;ions. Dur|ing all which exhortations &s;he &s;eemed in great agitation, and made an&s;wer with a faltering tongue; hope and tear, &s;hame, joy, and trembling apprehen&s;ion, alternately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Her father gave her up with great compo&s;ure, but her mother not without many tears. The colonel, who was pre|&s;ent, and much intere&s;ted in all that pa&s;&s;ed, gave her &s;everal
<PB N="41" REF="46">tokens of his high e&s;teem and good wi&s;hes, which &s;he ac|cepted with down-ca&s;t eyes and a &s;carcely audible voice. The &s;pectators &s;eemed to think her exceedingly well prepared, and whi&s;pered to each other about her uprightne&s;s, faith, virtue, con&s;tancy, and a thou&s;and other amiable qualifications for a &s;tate of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>When this &s;cene was over, &s;he appeared &s;omewhat more compo&s;ed, and ta&s;ted a little, and but a little, refre&s;hment. She &s;eemed to have forebodings of her fate, and expected that night to commence her &s;tate of la&s;ting mi&s;ery or bli&s;s.</P>
<P>Some of her young female acquaintance helped her to un|dre&s;s, and endeavoured to con&s;ole her. They told her, that it was what they mu&s;t all come to; that they doubted not &s;he would be happy; and &s;ympathetically wi&s;hed, that their time was al&s;o come. This afforded but little allay to her anxious expectation; &s;he expre&s;&s;ed great backwardne&s;s to depart, and trembled to think what torments &s;he might ere long endure. Then, turning her thoughts to the brighter &s;cenes, &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed her hope, that however &s;harp the &s;truggles of nature might be, &s;he &s;hould neverthele&s;s experience all beyond them to be delight and joy. Taking, therefore, an affectionate fare|wel of her young companions, &s;he compo&s;ed her&s;elf to meet her de&s;tiny; and, with a groan, was received into the bo&s;om of her lord.</P>

<HEAD>LOVE-LETTER, FROM AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY TO A WIDOW WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH I never, Madam, had the happine&s;s to &s;ee you&mdash;no, not &s;o much as in a picture&mdash;and con&s;e|quently can no more tell what complexion you are of than one who lives in the remote&s;t parts of China, I am neverthe|le&s;s mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately in love with you; and this affection has taken &s;uch deep root in my heart, that, on my con&s;cience! I could die a martyr for you with as much chearfulne&s;s as thou&s;ands have done for their religion, who were as ignorant of the truth for which they died as I am of your lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>This declaration, Madam, may &s;urprize you; but you will cea&s;e to wonder, when I have acquainted you what it was that not only gave birth to my pa&s;&s;ion, but has effectually confirmed it. La&s;t week, having occa&s;ion to ride into Surry, about &s;ome particular bu&s;ine&s;s, I noticed, not far from the road, a mo&s;t magnificent &s;eat. My curio&s;ity was in&s;tantane|ou&s;ly rai&s;ed to know the owner of &s;o beautiful a pile; and,
<PB N="42" REF="47">being informed that it belongs to your lady&s;hip, I began that very moment to have a very &s;trong inclination for you. When, therefore, I was farther a&s;&s;ured that &s;ome two thou|&s;and acres of the be&s;t ground in England appertained to this noble fabrick, together with a fine park, delightful gardens, variety of fi&s;h-ponds, and other de&s;irable conveniences, I then fell up to the ears in love, and re&s;olved to enli&s;t my&s;elf among the number of your humble &s;ervants and &s;incere admirers.</P>
<P>"The owner of &s;o many fine things," &s;aid I to my&s;elf, "mu&s;t needs be the fine&s;t women in the world. What though &s;he be old&mdash;her trees are green! What though &s;he may have lo&s;t the lilies and the ro&s;es in her cheeks&mdash;&s;he has enough left in her gardens! What though &s;he &s;hould be barren&mdash;her fields are &s;ufficiently fruitful."</P>
<P>With the&s;e thoughts in my head, I alighted from my hor&s;e, and at once became &s;o enamoured of your lady&s;hip, that I told my pa&s;&s;ion to every tree in your park: and, by the bye, they are the talle&s;t, &s;traighte&s;t, lovelie&s;t, fine&s;t &s;haped-trees, I ever beheld in my life.</P>
<P>I now appeal to your lady&s;hip, whether any lover was ever influenced by more &s;olid motives than your devoted humble &s;ervant. Tho&s;e who are wholly captivated by beauty, will infallibly find their pa&s;&s;ion decay with the tran&s;itory charm which at fir&s;t attracted their regard; and tho&s;e who pretend to admire a woman merely for the qualities of her mind, mu&s;t con&s;ider her &s;oul as ab&s;tracted from her body: but he who loves not a woman in the fle&s;h, as well as in the &s;pirit, is only fit, in my opinion, to make love to a &s;pectre; whereas my pa&s;&s;ion, the &s;incerity of which you cannot po&s;&s;ibly doubt is built on the &s;ame foundation with your hou&s;e, grows with your trees, and will daily increa&s;e with your e&s;tate.</P>
<P>For any thing I know to the contrary, you may be the hand&s;ome&s;t woman in the kingdom; but, whether you are &s;o or not, &s;ignifies little, while you have fortune enough to &s;ix my affection. I am a &s;oldier my profe&s;&s;ion; and, as I have fought for pay, by Heaven's ble&s;&s;ing! I mean to love for money.</P>
<P>All your other &s;uitors would &s;peak the &s;ame language, if they were equally hone&s;t; and, &s;hould you favour this blunt addre&s;s, by making choice of me, I can add, for your com|fort, that you will be the fir&s;t woman on record, from the creation to the pre&s;ent hour, who ever loved a man for telling her the truth.</P>

<HEAD>THE WIDOW's ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH, Sir, I have never had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing you, and my fancy cannot po&s;&s;ibly form an idea of your per&s;on, from the ingenuous frankne&s;s of your epi&s;tle, and the
<PB N="43" REF="48">matchle&s;s impudence of your addre&s;s, I am equally inclined to love and to de&s;pi&s;e you. That you could die a martyr for me, with as much chearfulne&s;s as thou&s;ands have done for their religion, I can by no means believe; for, in the next world, I have neither a hou&s;e, nor a tree, that I can call my own; and, were &s;uch a tragi-comical event to take place, I much que&s;tion whether I &s;hould have the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on to wi&s;h it otherwi&s;e. This declaration, Sir, may &s;urprize you: but you will cea&s;e to wonder, when I tell you, that I have no very favourable opinion of a &s;oldier. My la&s;t hu&s;band was an of|ficer in the army, young, hand&s;ome, intelligent, and ble&s;t with every requi&s;ite, &s;ave one, to render me perfectly happy.&mdash;"Save one!" you will reply; "What could that be?"&mdash;CONSTANCY, Sir; the ba&s;is of felicity in a conjugal &s;tate. He loved the women indi&s;criminately; me, apparently, more than the re&s;t, becau&s;e it was more to his intere&s;t. My per|&s;onal property became his the moment we were married; but my real e&s;tate, with which you are &s;o much enamoured, he could not touch without my con&s;ent. This kept him in good humour; for he well knew, that if he di&s;plea&s;ed me, I &s;hould at my decea&s;e bequeath the whole to a poor relation, and leave him the pill of di&s;appointment, to carry off the dregs of in|&s;olence. Thus happily fortified again&s;t the tyranny of his na|tural di&s;po&s;ition, I lived in tolerable ea&s;e with him for the &s;pace of three years; when a lingering intermittent brought on a con&s;umption, which &s;oon clo&s;ed the career of his life, and made me an inheritor of liberty at large. This &s;udden re|ver&s;ion of my fate, from &s;ubjection to freedom, was the grand de&s;ideratum of my wi&s;hes; and, as I have known a depri|vation of liberty, I &s;hall now &s;et the higher value on that ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing. In&s;tead, therefore, of giving you the encouragement you &s;olicit, I mu&s;t tell you frankly, that hav|ing known the joys of matrimony, as well as it's inconveni|ences, I am not inclined to purcha&s;e a moment's plea&s;ure with an age of pain. I am now my own mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;ubject to no controul; and above the cen&s;ure of the impertinent. What|ever may be your opinion of me, after the peru&s;al of this let|ter, be a&s;&s;ured it is not in your power, however &s;pecious your arguments, or captivating your per&s;on may be, to di&s;turb for one moment the tranquillity of her who, having known the duplicity and incon&s;tancy of one, will never entru&s;t to another that happine&s;s which &s;he now finds in her own bo&s;om.

<HEAD>SIR SIMON AND HODGE; OR, THE ADDITIONAL WRINKLE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. HARRISON.</BYLINE>
<L>AS Hodge, one day, was &s;welt'ring in the &s;un,</L>
<L>A dry old dog, yet a true child of fun;</L>
<L>Sir Simon came, to &s;ee his man &s;o blithe,</L>
<L>Panting beneath the labour of his &s;cythe:</L>
<L>For Hodge had ri&s;en ere the early dawn,</L>
<L>'Twas now high noon, nor yet clean &s;hav'd the lawn.</L>
<L>Much had he done, which he was pleas'd to view,</L>
<L>But curs'd the little that remain'd to do.</L>
<L>His arms were weary, and his aged back</L>
<L>Seem'd ev'ry &s;inew, at each bend, to crack;</L>
<L>At ev'ry &s;troke, the drops of &s;weat fa&s;t pace</L>
<L>Down the rough furrows of his time-plough'd face.</L>
<L>And &s;till he &s;tops, though he can &s;carcely &s;tand,</L>
<L>To &s;weep his dewy forehead with his hand;</L>
<L>With frequent rubbings whets his ling'ring blade,</L>
<L>And &s;ighs for ev'ning, and the fre&s;h'ning &s;hade.</L>
<L>Now old Sir Simon was as queer a &s;oul,</L>
<L>As Hodge him&s;elf, but nothing like &s;o droll:</L>
<L>He had &s;ome wit, and thought that he had more,</L>
<L>As many a greater wit has done before;</L>
<L>And many another, we may well maintain,</L>
<L>Has done &s;o &s;ince, and will do &s;o again.</L>
<L>"Hodge," &s;ays Sir Simon, "you can't well be dry,</L>
<L>For you are wet enough, I &s;ee, to fry;</L>
<L>Now had you been but dry enough to burn,</L>
<L>A jug of ale had done you no ill-turn!"</L>
<L>Hodge &s;mil'd at very mention of the nappy;</L>
<L>But, at the &s;ight, was wondrou&s;ly more happy:</L>
<L>For now Sir Simon, having had his joke,</L>
<L>Drew the full pitcher from beneath his cloak.</L>
<L>Hodge &s;eiz'd, with eager hand, the foaming prize;</L>
<L>And, heav'n-ward rai&s;ing both his grateful eyes,</L>
<L>Fa&s;t down his throat the welcome liquor pours,</L>
<L>Nor heeds his ma&s;ter, loudly though he roars&mdash;</L>
<L>"Stop, Hodge! why, Hodge; zounds! Hodge, why don't you &s;top?</L>
<L>I'm thir&s;ty too; zounds! Hodge, leave me a drop!"</L>
<L>Sir Simon bawl'd as loud as he could bawl,</L>
<L>But Hodge ne'er &s;topp'd, till he had &s;wallow'd all.</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="50">As flowly, now, he panting gains his breath,</L>
<L>That &s;eem'd awhile o'ermatch'd by &s;truggling death&mdash;</L>
<L>"Hodge," &s;ays Sir Simon, "pry'thee can&s;t not hear?</L>
<L>Why, zounds! I bade thee not drink all the beer!</L>
<L>Deuce take thy throat, mine's hoar&s;e with &s;o much bawl;</L>
<L>I've half a mind to ram down jug and all.</L>
<L>I told thee I was dry as well as thee;</L>
<L>But not a drop, plague take thee, 's left for me!"</L>
<L>Hodge now affected wonderful &s;urprize,</L>
<L>And like a pig's ju&s;t &s;tuck appear'd his eyes&mdash;</L>
<L>"Lord, Sir," &s;ays Hodge, &s;eemingly va&s;t contrite,</L>
<L>Though bent by trick to pacify the knight&mdash;</L>
<L>"I&s;e be main &s;orry thus to give offence;</L>
<L>But, to a per&s;on of your wor&s;hip's &s;en&s;e,</L>
<L>I&s;e need not &s;ay, for that would be ab&s;urd,</L>
<L>While a man drinks he ne'er can hear one word."&mdash;</L>
<L>"Not hear while drinking?" &s;traight Sir Simon cries,</L>
<L>Fill'd, in his turn, with a &s;tuck pig's &s;urprize;</L>
<L>"Why, &s;ure&mdash;why, &s;ure, Hodge&mdash;that can never be!</L>
<L>Egad, I'll fetch another jug, and &s;ee."</L>
<L>Away the knight, with his be&s;t &s;peed, then went,</L>
<L>To find the truth, as told by Hodge, intent;</L>
<L>And Hodge, mean time, contriv'd the means to make</L>
<L>Sir Simon, what he &s;aid, for Go&s;pel take.</L>
<L>"Now, Hodge," the knight, returning, cried, "we'll try</L>
<L>If what you tell me truth be, or a lye.</L>
<L>I'll drink, and you mu&s;t bellow&mdash;"Stop, &s;top, &s;top!</L>
<L>Do, pray, Sir," you may add, "leave me a drop."</L>
<L>This, when I hear, I certainly will do;</L>
<L>So, as I drink, remember, Hodge, bawl you."</L>
<L>Sir Simon heav'd the pitcher to his head;</L>
<L>Hodge op'd his mouth, but not a word he &s;aid:</L>
<L>Yet gap'd &s;o wide, there &s;eem'd abundant fear</L>
<L>The fellow meant to tear from ear to ear.</L>
<L>"This truth, &s;o &s;trange," to Hodge Sir Simon cried,</L>
<L>"I ne'er would have believ'd, had I not tried.</L>
<L>Thus, Hodge, it is, though life wears fa&s;t away,</L>
<L>Wi&s;er and wi&s;er, we grow ev'ry day!</L>
<L>This time thou had&s;t, I fairly own, mo&s;t brains,</L>
<L>So freely take the liquor for thy pains."</L>
<L>Hodge thus got paid for playing off his wit;</L>
<L>And pleas'd his ma&s;ter was, though he was bit:</L>
<L>Convine'd that he had gain'd a wrinkle more,</L>
<L>No matter where&mdash;than e'er he had before.</L>

<HEAD>PLATE III. THE IDLE 'PRENTICE AT PLAY IN THE CHURCH-YARD DURING DIVINE SERVICE.</HEAD>
<P>IN this admirable Print, a fine contra&s;t is afforded to the preceding one. Here, while the virtuous and indu&s;trious youth is performing the duty of a pious Chri&s;tian, his indolent and vicious fellow-apprentice lies &s;tretched on a tomb-&s;tone, and gambling with the vile&s;t a&s;&s;ociates. They are playing at hu&s;tle-cap; and Tom Idle is in the act of cheating, by a concealment of &s;ome of the half pence under the broad brim of his hat.</P>
<P>A Shoe-black, di&s;tingui&s;hed by his &s;tool, ba&s;ket, and bru&s;hes, challenges the fraud; and their pro&s;ligate Companion, with a black patch over his eye, is re&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ting on fair play.</P>
<P>So deeply are they engaged in the di&s;pute, that the Beadle, &s;ummoned by the noi&s;e of their quarrel, approaches unperceived to cha&s;ti&s;e them with his cane. The fir&s;t intimation of the Beadle's pre&s;ence is obviou&s;ly &s;ignified by a &s;mart application of the rattan on the culprit's back.</P>
<P>That the filthie&s;t and mo&s;t &s;lothful wretches are under the nece&s;&s;ity of continually employing their hands, however re|luctantly, is manife&s;t in the active &s;earch of the Shoe-black beneath his rags, as well as the &s;imilar diligence of the Lad with his hat &s;cratched more than half off his head, who are both evidently infe&s;ted by an enemy that compels them to be bu&s;y with their &s;ingers.</P>

<P>The fatality of a&s;&s;ociating with &s;uch mi&s;creants will be abundantly demon&s;trated in the &s;ucceeding &s;eries; where the fellow with a black patch over one eye, fir&s;t encountered at a &s;ort of gaming-table in a church-yard, leads Tom Idle, a not unwilling votary, into the depths of iniquity, and then, like the arch-betrayer of mankind, compleatly abandons him.</P>

<HEAD>PROFESSIONAL SPEECHES AT A BRUISING MATCH.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. HARRISON.</BYLINE>
<P>AS I was a few days ago cro&s;&s;ing Moorfields, I perceived a large crowd of people gathered together, making a noi&s;e to the full as confu&s;ed, and generally &s;peaking to the full as unintelligible, as could po&s;&s;ibly be heard at the famous building of the Tower of Babel.</P>
<P>I am naturally aver&s;e to &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies: but, as I was at a lo&s;s to know with certainty from what cau&s;e it originated, curio&s;ity prompted me to vi&s;it the &s;cene of action; where I beheld one of the mo&s;t &s;tubborn battles, between a coalheaver and a carman, that perhaps ever was &s;een, at the trifling ex|pence of a tolerable handkerchief, and an old memorandum-book of no u&s;e to any one but the right-owner.</P>
<P>What &s;truck me mo&s;t forcibly, during this conflict, was the jargon which flew about on the occa&s;ion; and in which, as the company probably con&s;i&s;ted of almo&s;t every different &s;pecies of artificers and labourers, I thought I could di&s;cover &s;triking traits of their re&s;pective profe&s;&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS TO THE GOOD PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>AND really a good &s;ort of people ye are, when ye are plea&s;ed. The ta&s;k is not difficult to bring ye into good|humour, neither; but I defy all the arti&s;ts in Europe to keep you &s;o.</P>
<P>Ye love to find fault; nay, to make faults: and, if you cannot quarrel with your neighbours, you will fall out with your&s;elves; like the greyhound, who u&s;ed to grow angry at his own tail.</P>
<P>You may &s;ay that I am guilty of inju&s;tice; and that ye are affable, humane, friendly, charitable, &s;ocial, &s;weet-tempered,
<PB N="53" REF="61">&s;elf-denying, beings: if every per&s;on was to draw his own picture, the pen-and-ink portrait would appear &s;o; but I, who have looked upon life for above twenty years, as an uncon|cerned &s;pectator of all the fanta&s;ticalne&s;s with which mankind have fatigued them&s;elves&mdash;to me ye appear &s;elfi&s;h, &s;tubborn, querulous, conceited, di&s;contented, exi&s;tences; and ever en|joy more than ye de&s;erve, yet are daily wi&s;hing for more en|joyments, and to do le&s;s to de&s;erve them.</P>
<P>I dined ye&s;terday at Mr. Fineer's; and his elde&s;t &s;on being introduced, according to the ancient family cu&s;tom of &s;hew|ing the vi&s;itors how much wit the heir has, one of the gue&s;ts addre&s;&s;ed his papa with&mdash;"I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, you will bring ma&s;|ter up to your bu&s;ine&s;s."&mdash;"Bring him up to be a hangman, rather!" was the parent's an&s;wer. "No, no; he &s;hall never be brought up to work all his life-time for nothing, as I have done." And yet this per&s;on has gained, by his own indu&s;try and &s;ucce&s;s in trade, upwards of four thou&s;and pounds. But thus it is; we covet to enjoy &s;till more than we do, and want &s;till to do le&s;s for it.</P>
<P>Epictetus &s;ays, mankind are di&s;&s;atisfied; Senecca &s;ays, they are di&s;contented: and this is what, both before and &s;ince Se|neca, every per&s;on has been &s;aying, who could &s;ay any thing.</P>
<P>With your leave, good people, I &s;hall pre&s;ent you with a couple of characters: as it is common for tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves to be arti&s;ts, to exhibit &s;pecimens of their perform|ances, I offer the&s;e with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and tell me, if you plea&s;e, how you like them.</P>
<P>They are &s;ketches of a Farmer and a Hop-planter.</P>
<P>In the harve&s;t &s;ea&s;on, that particular month of Providence's bounty, when all the animal creation appears chearfully in|du&s;trious, and we may even fancy approaching Winter to bear a &s;mile on his weather-worn wrinkles, when he views the &s;tore that is gathering in to comfort him while he vi&s;its us; yet, even then, congratulate the Farmer on the noble pro&s;pect of his well-covered acres, he will &s;hake his head; and, be|tween a &s;igh and a grunt, he will an&s;wer you with&mdash;"Ah, but the &s;traw is &s;hort!"</P>
<P>If the &s;traw is long, then he will tell you there is no &s;ub|&s;tance in the grain.</P>
<P>If there is but an indifferent crop, he laments that it will not pay the expence of hou&s;ing and thre&s;hing.</P>
<P>If a plentiful crop, then he grumbles, corn will be &s;o cheap, it will not be worth carrying to market.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t &s;o the Hop-planter: he ri&s;es, lifts up the &s;a&s;h, and looks over the horizon; if the morning happens to be cloudy, he
<PB N="54" REF="62">pulls down the window with an oath, &s;aying&mdash;"It will rain to-day, and all the blo&s;&s;oms will be wa&s;hed off!"</P>
<P>If there &s;hould be a plea&s;ant air abroad, then the poles will be all blown down.</P>
<P>If the &s;un &s;hines, "O Lord! the plants will be burned up."</P>
<P>If it is a clo&s;e, dry day, without much &s;un&s;hine, or wind, then he wi&s;hes for rain to de&s;troy the vermin, or el&s;e they will eat all the buds up.</P>
<P>The reader, who neither owns hop-grounds, nor rents corn|lands, will wonder how the&s;e per&s;ons can be &s;o di&s;contented. Yet it is an even bett, that tho&s;e who &s;eem to be amazed at &s;uch grumblers, are as di&s;&s;atisfied them&s;elves: the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;temper may be different, but the di&s;ea&s;e is the &s;ame in almo&s;t all.</P>
<P>Half the cure is &s;uppo&s;ed to be performed when the phy&s;i|cian knows, the patient's di&s;order. Indeed, my good people, neighbours, countrymen, and choice &s;pirits, I do know, bon&acirc; fide, that you are di&s;ordered, and know that you di&s;order is; nay, would pre&s;cribe for you, but imagine my medicines will be thrown away.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e I order you a few grains of &s;elf-knowledge, half a drachm of patience, and a &s;cruple of &s;elf-denial, mixed up with a tea-&s;poonful of the &s;yrup of humanity, will any of you take &s;uch an electuary? Ye might ta&s;te it, indeed, for the novelty's &s;ake; but I will bett a handful of integrity, again&s;t all court ceremonies, that ye &s;pit it out again.</P>
<P>Folly has thrown your heads into hy&s;tericks; and I will &s;ay opinion again&s;t common-&s;en&s;e, which are the greate&s;t odds that can be offered, not one man in many dozens knows what is the matter with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>La&s;t week I called on an old acquaintance: his lady told me her &s;pou&s;e was di&s;turbed and di&s;ordered at &s;omething, &s;he could not tell for what; and that &s;he was happy at my calling, be|cau&s;e &s;he hoped I would get him into &s;pirits again.</P>
<P>I went to him into his &s;tudy; there he &s;at, di&s;contented as an undone game&s;ter. I took him by the hand, and enquired if he was ill. He replied that, thank God, he enjoyed as good a &s;tate of health as any man in the world. I de&s;ired to know if his affairs were any way complicated, which might make him unea&s;y. His reply was&mdash;"Sir, I do not owe any per&s;on a &s;hilling; and my income greatly exceeds my out-&s;ets."&mdash; "I hope, Sir, no words have happened betwixt your lady and you?"&mdash;"There is not a better woman breathing, Sir; and we live in continued harmony."&mdash;"How does your daughter, Sir?"&mdash;"Married, Sir, and as happy as I am."&mdash;"Your &s;on at college?"&mdash;"My &s;on, Sir, contributes to my happine&s;s; I
<PB N="55" REF="63">hear every body prai&s;e him."&mdash;"What then, Sir, can you be unea&s;y about?"&mdash;"See there, Sir!" my friend replied, rai&s;|ing his voice at the &s;ame time, and pulling &s;ome printed papers out of his pocket. "There, Sir! read there! There is the Gazetteer, and the General, and the Ledger, and the He|rald, and the Chronicle, and the Morning Po&s;t. Who can enjoy them&s;elves when we read &s;uch terrible accounts as they give us; not only of the government, but al&s;o of them|&s;elves; Mercy upon us! but we are a bought-and-&s;old nation!"</P>
<P>With &s;ome difficulty I per&s;uaded him to come into company again, and once more be him&s;elf; and leave the &s;tudy of poli|ticks alone to tho&s;e who loved to be impo&s;ed on.</P>
<P>I told him, all that a man of &s;en&s;e ought to do, was to con|form to the laws of God and his country; to take things as they were; u&s;e them as they &s;hould be; act with as much in|tegrity to mankind as the cu&s;toms of the world would &s;uffer; and, independent and contented, enjoy the plea&s;ures of dome&s;|tick &s;ociety, and wait with patience for that awful, that all-intere&s;ting event, when empire breaks his &s;ceptre, and beauty cea&s;es to be amiable, when faction is di&s;&s;ipated, the phantom of pride vani&s;hed, and all the worldly di&s;tinctions are buried in a death-bed di&s;&s;olution.</P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER OF A. HARE, ESQ. A VERY EXTRAORDINARY COUNTRY GENTLEMAN.</HEAD>
<P>PERMIT this letter to inform you, that there is coming up to town by the Norwich coach, one who has lived mo&s;t part of his time in our neighbourhood; if, indeed, he is not a native of this county: but of that I cannot be po&s;itive, neither is it very material, as I can, notwith&s;tanding, give you a &s;ufficient account of him for your conduct re&s;pecting the re|ception and treatment which it will be proper to give him, having furni&s;hed him &mdash; for he never was in town before&mdash;with a direction to your hou&s;e. His conduct in time pa&s;t has been, though not totally irreprehen&s;ible, as innocent, at lea&s;t, as that of mo&s;t others. Some few complaints I have heard of his depredations in the gardens, if not in the orchards, of his neighbours; but yet they have been ready to acknowledge, at the &s;ame time, they believe he thought no harm. It is true, he was rather wild in his youth, but never extravagant or gay in dre&s;s. Living wholly in the country, he has no notion of the amu&s;ements of the town; but, being remarkably light of foot, has not been able entirely to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from field di|ver&s;ions;
<PB N="56" REF="64">nor yet has he indulged him&s;elf in them. Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions he has been much &s;ought; and, when he has been only ju&s;t &s;een, or, as it were, had in view, it is &s;urpriz|ing how the re&s;t of the company have exulted; and much has been, in the words of the poet, on other joyous occa&s;ions, "the clamour of men, of boys, and dogs." But, though every body el&s;e has appeared highly delighted, I have rea&s;on to believe he never enjoyed peace of mind at &s;uch riotous doings; for he has always endeavoured to leave them as &s;oon as he could, and &s;ometimes he has &s;tolen away, and left them at a fault for want of his company. But how forcible is unprofitable com|pany! At other times, a more &s;elect party have compelled him to take the lead, and go greater lengths than he approved: which has &s;till been attended with unea&s;ine&s;s of mind, and frequently has he been turned: but lately, on an occa&s;ion of that &s;ort, he received &s;o &s;evere a check in the mid&s;t of his ca|reer, that it entirely put a &s;top to his progre&s;s in that way; and, to tell you the truth, is the cau&s;e of his leaving the coun|try at this time. Though much altered in that re&s;pect, I believe he is &s;till what may be called hare-brained, which I &s;uppo&s;e you will di&s;cover before he has been long in your company. Unaccu&s;tomed to being frequently in much com|pany, as well as naturally timid and &s;hy, even in the country, it is not to be expected he will ever be capable of entertaining a very large company; but a few &s;elect friends, I believe, will be very well &s;atisfied with what they can obtain from him, or pick out of him. And, let me tell you, however unlikely it may &s;eem, he will bear a roa&s;ting as well as mo&s;t; only take this information along with you, as he is a mere ru&s;tick, and has indulged his appetite in the country without &s;cruple, though with &s;trict temperance, it may not be ami&s;s to fill his belly with pudding, and perhaps a gla&s;s of wine may not be ill-be&s;towed, before you try that experiment upon him. Of the family of the Hares you have doubtle&s;s heard. I have &s;ome notion, one of them attained to con&s;iderable dignity in the national church; but the &s;ubject of this letter, though of the &s;ame name, is not of that family, but of one more ancient; nor did ever one of the&s;e profe&s;s with them: not but that I lately read an account in the new&s;papers of one of this family, who went to a place of publick wor&s;hip in time of &s;ervice, but I believe with no more devotion than &s;ome others whom I have heard called Thorough Churchmen, from their going, as it is mo&s;t likely he did, in at one door and out at the other. Though this family cannot boa&s;t of places or pen&s;ions from the court, they have not been totally di&s;regarded by the le|gi&s;lature.
<PB N="57" REF="65">The nobility and gentry having put it out of the power, as far as acts of parliament, with united a&s;&s;ociations to enforce them, can do it, of the &s;mall vulgar, to exerci&s;e their mercile&s;s tempers upon them; as they were too apt to do, if they could only extort from them a meal's meat by it, and &s;ometimes merely for the diver&s;ion of following them from place to place: and yet, I believe, if they were to &s;peak all the truth, we &s;hould find them&s;elves more frequently injured, and more wantonly per&s;ecuted, by their profe&s;&s;ed protectors, than any other men; and, may I not add, perhaps they are not alone in that predicament. But, as this letter is not intended to be a vehicle for political or di&s;affected reflections on men and mea&s;ures, I &s;hall conclude with wi&s;hing the &s;ubject of it may arrive &s;afe at your hou&s;e, and give your wife and your|&s;elf as much &s;atisfaction as it gives me plea&s;ure to have &s;uch an opportunity of &s;ub&s;cribing my&s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>SPECIMEN OF BEAU NASH'S MANNER OF TELLING A STORY.</HEAD>
<P>I Will tell you &s;omething to that purpo&s;e&mdash;that, I fancy, will make you laugh. A covetous old par&s;on, as rich as the devil, &s;craped a fre&s;h acquaintance with me &s;everal years ago at Bath. I knew him when he and I were &s;tudents at Oxford, where we both &s;tudied damnationly hard; but that is neither here nor there. Well, very well. I entertained him at my hou&s;e in John's Court&mdash;no, my hou&s;e in John's Court was not built then&mdash;but I entertained him with all that the city could afford; the rooms, the mu&s;ick, and every thing in the 'world. On his leaving Bath, he pre&s;&s;ed me very bard to return the vi&s;it; and de&s;ired me to let him have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing me at his hou&s;e in Devon&s;hire. About &s;ix months after, I happened to be in that neighbourhood; and was re&s;olved to &s;ee my old friend, from whom I expected a very warm reception. Well, I knocks at his door: when an old queer creature of a maid came to the door, and denied him. I &s;u&s;pected, however, that he was at home; and, going into the parlour, what &s;hould I &s;ee but the par&s;on's legs up the chimney, where he had thru&s;t him&s;elf to avoid entertaining me. This was very well. "My dear," &s;ays I to the maid, "it is very cold, extreme cold, indeed; and, I am afraid, I have got a touch of my ague: light me the fire, if you plea&s;e."&mdash;"La, Sir!" &s;ays the maid, who was a mode&s;t creature, to be &s;ure, "the chimney &s;mokes mon&s;trou&s;ly; you would not bear the
<PB N="58" REF="66">room for three minutes together." By the greate&s;t good luck there was a bundle of &s;traw on the hearth, and I called for a candle. The candle came. "Well, good woman," &s;ays I, "&s;ince you will not light me a fire, I will light one for my|&s;elf:" and in a moment the &s;traw was all in a blaze. This quickly unkennelled the old fox: there he &s;tood in an old ru&s;ty night-gown, ble&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, and looking like&mdash;a&mdash;hem&mdash; egad!</P>

<HEAD>THE SPEAKING DOG. A PERSIAN STORY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH.</HEAD>
<P>A King of Per&s;ia, who was in the &s;ixty-third year of his age, grew &s;o doating fond of one of his concubines, a fair Circa&s;&s;ian, named Roxana, that he obliged him&s;elf, by a &s;olemn oath, never to refu&s;e her any thing &s;he &s;hould reque&s;t of him. The lady made her advantage of this monarch's weakne&s;s; and every day, by &s;ome new and extravagant de|mand, took occa&s;ion to gratify her ambition, her avarice, or her revenge. During the career of her power, a certain Eu|ropean merchant, who had &s;old her &s;ome jewels, in order to engage her intere&s;t and protection at court, made her a pre|&s;ent of a beautiful little dog, which had been taught to dance, and play a thou&s;and antick tricks. In a &s;hort time, Roxana became as fond of her dog as the king was of her; only &s;he lamented, that the little creature was not endowed with &s;peech, and could not, therefore, make a proper reply to tho&s;e endear|ing expre&s;&s;ions &s;he u&s;ed as often as &s;he care&s;&s;ed him. One of her eunuchs then pre&s;ent, told her &s;he need not grieve on this account; for he knew a philo&s;opher, named Hali, then living in the &s;uburbs of I&s;pahan, who could teach her dog to &s;peak the Per&s;ian language as articulately as he &s;poke it him&s;elf:
<PB N="59" REF="67">that he had learned this art from a Grecian &s;age, who had not only given &s;peech to dogs, and other animals of his country, but had rendered them as learned and knowing as tho&s;e great men among the ancients who had been bred in the &s;chools of Athens. Hali was immediately &s;ent for, made acquainted with this bu&s;ine&s;s, and required to attend the next morning to give the dog his fir&s;t le&s;&s;on. It was in vain for the poor man to remon&s;trate again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch an undertaking; he was an&s;wered, it was the king's command, and mu&s;t not be di&s;puted: that, if he performed what was enjoined him in the &s;pace of thirty days, he &s;hould be amply rewarded; if he failed, he &s;hould lo&s;e his head.</P>
<P>Hali, we may imagine, con&s;idered the king's command as the artifice of his enemies, and as a trap which they had laid for his life. He communicated his di&s;tre&s;s to his elde&s;t &s;on, a youth of nineteen, who had a ready wit, and excellent parts, which had been well cultivated and improved by his wi&s;e fa|ther's in&s;tructions. He had, be&s;ides, a mo&s;t engaging manner of addre&s;s, a great &s;weetne&s;s of temper, and a beautiful per&s;on. Mirza&mdash;for that was the young man's name&mdash;bur&s;t into tears when he heard the king's orders; but, immediately recovering him&s;elf, he told his father that he had thought of a certain method to divert the danger which threatened their family.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e he de&s;ired Hali to pre&s;ent him the next morning to the chief eunuch as his daughter, and as a per&s;on well in&s;tructed in her father's art, and who would engage, at the hazard of her own life, as well as his; to execute the king's injunction, and thereby merit his grace and favour. Hali looked upon his &s;on with amazement; and per&s;uading him&s;elf that he &s;poke by the in&s;piration of the Prophet, who had taken their hou&s;e under his protection, he made no diffi|culty of complying with young Mirza's reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Accordingly, next morning, Mirza, di&s;gui&s;ed in a virgin's habit, was conducted to the chief eunuch, and by him led into Roxana's apartment; where he performed his part &s;o well, that, before the month expired, it was reported all over the &s;eraglio, that the philo&s;opher's daughter had taught the little dog not only to &s;peak, but to &s;peak like a wi&s;e man, and an|&s;wer pertinently to every que&s;tion. The king would needs be a&s;&s;ured of the truth of this prodigy. He made a vi&s;it to his favourite; &s;he confirmed the report; and the dog being pre|&s;ented to him, was commanded to give a proof of his ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ra|ordinary talents, by an&s;wering re&s;pectfully whatever the king &s;hould be plea&s;ed to a&s;k him.</P>
<P>The monarch &s;eated him&s;elf on a &s;opha; and, taking the dog in his arms, gently &s;troked his head&mdash;(and he &s;troked it,
<PB N="60" REF="68">and &s;he &s;troked it; and &s;he &s;troked it, and he &s;troked it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have tran&s;lated this parenthe&s;is word for word.

The gentlemen who are le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ned in the doctrine of in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">endoes may probably di&s;cover the author's meaning.</NOTE>)&mdash; and then he propo&s;ed this que&s;tion: "Say, thou pretty ani|mal, who am I?" After a &s;hort &s;ilence, Roxana entreated the king to tell her if he was not highly delighted with the an&s;wer which the little bea&s;t had made him, and whether he could ever have believed the thing if he had not heard it. The king prote&s;ted he had not heard a word; at which Roxana &s;eemed much concerned; and, looking earne&s;tly in the king's face, demanded again, if his maje&s;ty had not heard the dog an&s;wer him in the words following&mdash;"You are the &s;on of the &s;un, the lieutenant of the prophets, and the king of kings; you are dreaded by your enemies, adored by your &s;ubjects, and pa&s;&s;ionately beloved by my fair mi&s;tre&s;s."</P>
<P>The King of Per&s;ia ro&s;e up amazed and confounded; but, &s;till in&s;i&s;ting he did not hear the dog &s;peak, Roxana lifted up her hands, and thus addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Mahomet&mdash;"Thou me&s;|&s;enger of God, protect and defend the king; increa&s;e his ho|nour, lengthen his life, pre&s;erve his under&s;tanding, and open his ears; and, O never&mdash;never let him feel the infirmities of old age!" Then the dog being ordered to &s;peak a little louder, &s;he begged the king to make a &s;econd trial, which he did with great &s;ucce&s;s; for he now declared he heard the little creature di&s;tinctly utter every word, ju&s;t as Roxana had before repeated.</P>
<P>This occa&s;ioned an univer&s;al joy in the &s;eraglio. Nothing was talked of for &s;ome days but the &s;peaking dog. His an|&s;wer to the king was written in letters of gold, and pre&s;erved in the archives of the empire. The pretended daughter of Hali was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a noble reward, and her father was &s;oon afterwards promoted to one of the be&s;t governments in Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>The author of this tale concludes it with the following re|flection.</P>
<P>Old age very &s;eldom proves a ble&s;&s;ing to great men, e&s;pe|cially to the&s;e who have any &s;hare in the government of the world. The Per&s;ian monarch, who ruled &s;o many nations, and e&s;teemed him&s;elf a favourite of the gods, and the fir&s;t man in the univer&s;e, was not permitted the u&s;e of his eyes or his ears. He was the dupe of his &s;lave, and the je&s;t of his whole court; but no one dur&s;t tell him &s;o, and he died with|out knowing it.</P>

<HEAD>THE RIVAL ORATORS.</HEAD>
<P>ONE Sunday during la&s;t &s;ummer, while the weather was extremely hot, the windows of a certain pari&s;h church in the dioce&s;e of Glouce&s;ter were &s;et open to admit more air, while the congregation was a&s;&s;embled for divine &s;ervice.

<HEAD>PLATE IV. THE INDUSTRIOUS 'PRENTICE A FAVOURITE, AND EN|TRUSTED BY HIS MASTER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Print exhibits the con&s;equence re&s;ulting from the practice of virtue and piety, in the confidence and e&s;teem which it naturally in&s;pires.</P>
<P>While Tom Idle's depravity leads him to become the profli|gate a&s;&s;ociate of abject and vicious wretches, who prepare his mind for the commi&s;&s;ion of higher crimes; the virtuous incli|nations of his fellow-apprentice, Francis Goodchild, introduce him to the confidential friend&s;hip of his re&s;pectable ma&s;ter, and lead him onward to opulence and fame. He appears, in this Print, as pre&s;iding over the counting-hou&s;e, and entru&s;ted with the management of the entire bu&s;ine&s;s. The day-book is in his hands; the pur&s;e and keys are committed to his care; and the amiable familiarity with which his ma&s;ter leans on his &s;houlder, bearing a placid &s;mile on his intelligent countenance, demon&s;trates the entire &s;atisfaction with which he confides in this favourite youth, who&s;e a&s;pect and attitude &s;peak equally his evident de&s;ert. The union of the gloves, though laying as by accident, are finely figurative of the exi&s;ting friend&s;hip, and point to the future partner&s;hip of the parties; while the emblematical head-piece on the top of the London Almanack, ingeniou&s;ly pre&s;ents, under the form of an ANGEL, the Indu&s;trious Youth <HI>taking</HI> TIME <HI>by the Forelock.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A CURE FOR VULGAR PREJUDICES AGAINST DRESS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. HARRISON.</BYLINE>
<P>THE ab&s;urd prejudices of the Vulgar are in nothing more con&s;picuous than in their affected contempt of Dre&s;s, to which &s;o many thou&s;ands of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed owe their entire &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>In Spitalfields, for example, a few years ago, till every por|ter's knot began to cover a pig-tail, when any per&s;on of tole|rable decency happened to pa&s;s through one of the many popu|lous &s;treets of that di&s;trict with his hair queued, he was in|&s;ulted by myriads of men, women, and children, &s;warming at the doors and windows, with&mdash;"Look at his tail!"&mdash;"Only &s;ee there!"&mdash;"La, what a tail our cat has got!"&mdash;"Well, I wi&s;h I had but a tail!"&mdash;and a hundred &s;uch &s;peeches; till he happily got into the &s;omewhat more civilized regions of Whitechapel, Shoreditch, or Bethnal Green, where he was only liable to occa&s;ional attacks from &s;tragglers: the poor thoughtle&s;s wretches never once con&s;idering, that they &s;hould perhaps the next day be obliged to quit their habitations, and &s;olicit charity from the per&s;on they were then in&s;ulting, for want of that very employ, which the fa&s;hion they thus rudely di&s;|couraged was in &s;ome mea&s;ure calculated to promote; with the additional di&s;advantage of having &s;teeled one, who might otherwi&s;e have felt for their di&s;tre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, again&s;t Spitalfields weavers in general, by the indignities &s;o univer&s;ally received in
<PB N="75" REF="86">that quarter, and which mu&s;t &s;till be green in his remem|brance.</P>
<P>Chairmen, Hackney-coachmen, and Watermen, have al&s;o a large &s;hare of this di&s;po&s;ition, though they all owe much of their &s;upport to cau&s;es which could not exi&s;t without dre&s;s, the nece&s;&s;ary concomitant of vi&s;its and parties of plea&s;ure: and, with re&s;pect to the la&s;t cla&s;s of beings, in particular, it is ab&s;o|lutely impo&s;&s;ible, at pre&s;ent, for any well-dre&s;&s;ed per&s;on to walk on the &s;outhern banks of the Thames, or on the oppo|&s;ite &s;hore highter than London Bridge, without many &s;aluta|tions in what is emphatically &s;tiled Water Language, as pro|mulged in the neighbouring univer&s;ity of Billing&s;gate. Indeed, from that famous &s;eminary, abu&s;e is &s;o plentifully di&s;&s;eminated among all the &s;tall-keepers and ba&s;ket-carriers in our markets and publick &s;treets, and their re&s;pective connections, that it bids fair for becoming, what philo&s;ophers have long wanted, a univer&s;al dialect: nor can this univer&s;ality be at all won|dered at, by tho&s;e who con&s;ider that the venders of &s;prats, oy&s;ters, and other fi&s;h, in the winter&mdash;the &s;ea&s;on when they take their academical degrees&mdash;are retailers of &s;trawberries, cherries, goo&s;eberries, cucumbers, cabbages, and other fruits and vegetables, in the &s;ummer; and that they carry all their original learning, va&s;tly improved by practice, into every new pro&s;e&s;&s;ion, which is more than can be &s;aid of many profe&s;&s;ors in other arts and &s;ciences.</P>
<P>But though the &s;everal re&s;pectable per&s;onages included in the cla&s;&s;es ju&s;t mentioned, have powers of &s;peech at lea&s;t equal to tho&s;e of any other callings or profe&s;&s;ions whatever, calculated to expre&s;s their antipa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to what they chu&s;e to con&s;ider as &s;omething more than &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r&s;iuous attention to dre&s;s; there are other tribes nearly as well qualified in the&s;e re&s;pects, from their con&s;tant intercour&s;e with tho&s;e proficients, and who have the ad|ditional advantage of being abundantly better furni&s;hed, gene|rally &s;peaking, from the nature of their occupations, with imple|ments capable of giving the mo&s;t convincing proofs of their aver|&s;ion to any thing like gaiety, or even decency, in apparel. It is true that a ba&s;ket-woman may knock a lady down, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> even a gentleman, by running wilfully again&s;t them; or &s;he may con|tent her&s;elf with only carrying off the head-dre&s;s of the former, or hat and wig of the latter, to take their chance in the clean|line&s;s of the &s;treet&mdash;a barrow-girl may di&s;po&s;e the handles of her barrow, and a chairman his poles, &s;o as to throw down any per&s;on who&s;e dre&s;s gives them offence; or, at lea&s;t, tear a gown, a cloak, or the &s;kirt of a coat&mdash;and a coachman, and a waterman, mo&s;t of my readers have probably had frequent opportunities of ob&s;erving, know perfectly well how to &s;pla&s;h,
<PB N="76" REF="87">in the exerci&s;e of their re&s;pective vocations, any &s;imilar of|fender who happens to be pa&s;&s;ing by them; the one by making his hor&s;es &s;uddenly plunge in a full kenned, and the other by a dextrous manoeuvre with his oars. But the&s;e contrivances, excellent as they all undoubtedly are, and highly to the credit of the &s;everal ingenious inventors, as well as to the excellent police which encourages, by not di&s;couraging, &s;uch laudable endeavours to increa&s;e the con&s;umption of our manufactures, are of little or no con&s;equence, when compared with the very &s;uperior exertions of lamplighters, link-boys, chimney-&s;weepers, &s;cavengers, du&s;t-men, butchers, porters, and a variety of others; who are armed at all points to burn, oil, black, cover with mud, blind, brui&s;e, and maim: &s;o that all genteel per&s;ons, who never fail to excite their attention, may e&s;teem them&s;elves extremely fortunate, if they walk in the publick &s;treets for ten minutes without meeting with &s;ome accident, as it is called, either in per&s;on or dre&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e gentry, in what &s;eems to have become a part of their pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fe&s;&s;ions, is indeed mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hingly great: and the proofs they &s;o abundantly give &s;eldom fail to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et with univer&s;al approbation from the &s;urrounding &s;pectators, who cordially join in the laugh which practices of this kind com|monly in&s;pire; not always con&s;idering at who&s;e expence &s;ome future mirth of the &s;ame kind may chance to be furni&s;hed. So natural is it for man to enjoy the pre&s;ent; without any retro|&s;pect of the pa&s;t, or much concern about the future.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance, however, &s;ome time &s;ince came to my knowledge&mdash;for I was, unfortunately, not a &s;pectator of the tran&s;action&mdash;where a very laudable de&s;ign of this nature was not taken in &s;uch good part as u&s;ual, by the per&s;on on whom the intended favour was conferred. To &s;ay the truth, the gentleman, who turned out the hero in the bu&s;ine&s;s to which I allude, appears to have been rather too conver&s;ant in certain arts of the vulgar; though few, I apprehend, will greatly blame his conduct on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, when they have heard the whole &s;tory, which I &s;hall now endeavour to relate.</P>
<P>A gentleman from the We&s;t-end of the town, who not only approved of putting on clean &s;tockings, but who was de&s;irous to pre&s;erve them &s;o as much as po&s;&s;ible while they were on, was one dirty day ha&s;tening to his banker's, in Cornhill, with a very con&s;iderable &s;um in his pockets. At the north-ea&s;t corner of St. Paul's Church Yard, exactly in the cro&s;&s;ing to Cheap&s;ide, &s;tood a &s;eavenger's cart, attended by three or four begrimed myrmidons, who had wilfully blocked up the way, and waited the approach of a fit object for their mirth. The gentleman's white &s;ilk &s;tockings, and his evident caution in
<PB N="77" REF="88">walking, in&s;tantly attracted their notice: they accordingly &s;et him down as a proper in&s;trument, and made the u&s;ual di&s;po|&s;ition to receive him; &s;preading a large bed of mud acro&s;s the way, and wai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing his approach with their &s;coops and be&s;oms; while one went forward to the hor&s;es, that he might either ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k them, or make them &s;pring forward among the filth, as occa&s;ion &s;erved, &s;o as to produce the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous effect. A &s;ingle ha&s;tly glance of the gentleman's eye, however, &s;oon in|formed him what they meant to be at; and, in order to avoid them he kept to the left, intending to cro&s;s by the end of Newgate&mdash;formerly called Blowbladder&mdash;Street. But the game was in view, and they re&s;olved not to lo&s;e their &s;port: one of the fellows, therefore, running round the cart, where he had clearly no other bu&s;ine&s;s, met the gentleman as he pa&s;&s;ed the top of Paterno&s;ter Row; and fixed the dirty &s;coop with &s;o much adroitne&s;s, that it not only made an ample &s;pot on his &s;tooking, but very nearly threw him down. It was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that the gentleman's &s;pirit enabled him to bear for a moment this in&s;olent attack: but he wi&s;ely con&s;i|dered, that he had more property about him than he &s;hould chu&s;e to lo&s;e; that he had but a little way to go; and, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to have fini&s;hed, had they been more di&s;po&s;ed to work than they evidently were, before he &s;hould return. He therefore ha&s;tened on, without appearing to regard the univer&s;al roar of laughter again&s;t him; and, hav|ing di&s;patched his bu&s;ine&s;s, was back in about twenty minutes, at one trunk-maker's, the corner of St. Paul's, froin whence he was about to cro&s;s by the other's. The fellow, who had before met with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s and applau&s;e, had ob&s;erved him returning, and was re&s;olved to have a &s;troke at the other &s;tock|ing. He accordingly placed him&s;elf at the edge of the pave|ment, with his back towards Cheap&s;ide; ready to turn round the in&s;tant the gentleman &s;hould come up, with &s;uch an appli|cation of the muddy implement in his hand as could not well fail effectually to do the bu&s;ine&s;s. Thus &s;tationed, his grim features wore the a&s;pect of va&s;t &s;elf-complacency, and tho&s;e of his companions grinned their approbation. The gentleman had expected &s;ome &s;imilar arrangement; and, having deter|mined on the part which it would be proper for him to act, took no pains to avoid the a&s;&s;ailant, but went fairly into his clutches. The fellow, however, had very little time to con|gratulate him&s;elf on the good effect of his &s;tratagem: for the gentleman, being fully prepared, in&s;tantly fa&s;tened on his collar, and with a &s;ingle blow felled him to the earth. The others now came round; and, with the ulmo&s;t liberality&mdash;of abu&s;e, were about to convince him that four men are more than a
<PB N="78" REF="89">match for one: but the temporary &s;toppage had in the mean time formed a crowd; and, &s;everal per&s;ons of genteel appear|ance being among them, the gentleman addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to one in particular, and entreated him to depo&s;it his hat, coat, and watch, at the trunk-maker's, and to &s;ee that he had no foul play, as he had determined to fight the blackguard who had in&s;ulted him in his own way. This propo&s;al gave univer&s;al &s;atisfaction: for even the aggre&s;&s;or him&s;elf, little as he reli&s;hed the &s;pecimen he had received from his antagoni&s;t, entertained no &s;ort of doubt that his own &s;uperior &s;trength and &s;kill, joined to a pretty exten&s;ive practice, would &s;oon enable him to repay with intere&s;t the blow under which he &s;till &s;marted; and, at any rate, it was no &s;mall honour to box with a gentle|man &mdash;while, on the contrary, any thing like a refu&s;al to ac|cept &s;uch a challenge would brand him with all the infamy of an eternal imputation of cowardice among his companions; nor, perhaps, after all, &s;ave him from a drubbing fully equal to what he &s;hould receive in fair fighting. Which of the&s;e rea|&s;ons operated mo&s;t powerfully, or whether all of them acted in concert, it is not by any means ea&s;y to decide: however, he lo&s;t no time, in what bear-garden phra&s;eology denominates <HI>pecling,</HI> and in a few minutes he was quite <HI>unca&s;ed;</HI> in more refined language, &s;tripped to the &s;kin.</P>
<P>The ring was formed, and the combatants took their &s;tations. The gentleman waited coolly to receive the fellow, who ad|vanced with great fury: but the former dextrou&s;ly avoided a mo&s;t tremendous blow; and, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, nimbly dart|ing forward, gave his antagoni&s;t a mo&s;t &s;evere &s;troke under the ribs, which drove him breathle&s;s to the ground. He ro&s;e again, and was again treated preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner, with the addition of a deep cut in his &s;kull, received from a large &s;tone on which he this &s;econd time fell. He was now a&s;ked if he had enough; and loud were the plaudits of the mob, in prai&s;e of the gentleman's prowe&s;s, which all declared they had never &s;een exceeded. The fellow, however, was by no means &s;atisfied; for he had not once &s;truck his antagoni&s;t, and he confided that a &s;ingle blow from his powerful arm could not fail to terminate the conte&s;t: that blow, there|fore, he determined in his own mind to give; and approached for this purpo&s;e with much caution, not forgetting to pay par|ticular attention to the protection of his own ribs, which had been twice &s;o &s;everely handled exactly in the &s;ame place. The gentleman &s;aw what was pa&s;&s;ing, and took his mea&s;ures accord|ingly: he was round the fellow in a moment; and, darting a blow, from which he in&s;tantaneou&s;ly recoiled, hit him exactly between the eyes, with a violence which made them both
<PB N="79" REF="90">&s;well to an enormous &s;ize, and brought a torrent of blood from his no&s;trils. He was now wild with angui&s;h and di&s;appoint|ment; and, though he could hardly &s;tand&mdash;for the blow had made him &s;tagger, though he was kept from quite falling&mdash;he ru&s;hed on with prodigious force and fury. But extreme pa&s;|&s;ion had now thrown him quite off his guard; and another &s;mart application to his ribs again beat him to the earth, from whence he appeared in no condition &s;peedily to ari&s;e without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Indeed, it was for &s;ome time doubted that he would ever again recover. The gentleman, however, who had as much humanity as courage, de&s;ired a &s;urgeon might be &s;ent for before he quitted the &s;pot; ob&s;erving, that it was his wi&s;h only to cure, not to kill; the fellow who had want only in&s;ulted him. The mob felt that the gentleman's heart was good; and, with their u&s;ual attachment to what they think right, they idolized his genero&s;ity, as well as his courage, and would almo&s;t to a man have now lo&s;t their lives in his defence. What a pity that minds &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed &s;hould be ever mi&s;led! what a pity that they do not always di&s;cover what is ju&s;t! Had the gen|tleman been incapable of at fir&s;t taking his own part, the very &s;ame per&s;ons might have &s;een him treated with every indignity, and indeed cruelty, with the utmo&s;t unconcern; or even, per|haps, with a thoughtle&s;s appearance of brutal &s;atisfaction!</P>
<P>The poor wretch being at length &s;ufficiently recovered to &s;tand on his legs, he begged to &s;hake hands with the gentle|man; and acknowledged he was &s;orry that he had ill-treated a better man than him&s;elf. The tears gu&s;hed from the gen|tleman's eyes, at hearing this manly confe&s;&s;ion: he gave the poor fellow his hand, and with it a guinea; telling his com|panions, at the &s;ame time, that they all de&s;erved cha&s;ti&s;ement, but that he hoped they would profit by what they had &s;een, without the experience of a &s;imilar fate, which mu&s;t doubtle&s;s &s;ome time or other attend all who pur&s;ue &s;uch di&s;graceful prac|tices. They then &s;everally prote&s;ted that they were &s;orry for what they had done: and, though they evidently did not de&s;erve any reward, he generou&s;ly gave half a crown among them, which they declared they would &s;pend in drinking his honour's health; and I dare venture to add, that they mo&s;t religiou&s;ly kept their word.</P>
<P>It happened, &s;ome time after, that the &s;ame gentle|man&mdash;who&s;e extreme neatne&s;s was very apt to give the filthy &s;uch offence as his &s;ize and appearance were not calculated to prevent them from re&s;enting in their way&mdash;was pa&s;&s;ing down Fi&s;h-Street Hill, when a tall chimney-&s;weeper, with his two lads, literally bru&s;hed by him on each &s;ide, and &s;oiled his coat mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly. This was an in&s;ult not to be borne; he &s;eized
<PB N="80" REF="91">the bigge&s;t immediately, and complimented him with ju&s;t &s;uch another blow as he had formerly given the &s;cavenger. The fel|low ro&s;e, pretended the injury was quite accidental, and in&s;i&s;ted on receiving &s;ome &s;atisfaction for the a&s;&s;ault. A crowd gathered round; and the gentleman, as before, offered the aggre&s;&s;or battle. The challenge was accepted, and the &s;weep &s;tripped in what is called <HI>buff,</HI> but which did not, in this ca&s;e at lea&s;t, give any great idea of that colour. The ring was now formed, and the com|bat was about to commence; when a fellow ru&s;hed in, &s;tripped for the fight, &s;wearing heartily that the gentleman &s;hould not le&s;&s;en him&s;elf by engaging in &s;uch a conte&s;t, for that he him|&s;elf would fight any man who offended him. He gave no time for parley; but in&s;tantly attacked the chimney-&s;weeper, and to it they went thoroughly in earne&s;t. In a few mi|nutes, Victory declared her&s;elf again&s;t the chimney-&s;weeper, who&s;e eyes were in a fair way for emulating the colour of his cloth; and the gentleman &s;oon recognized, in his pre&s;ent cham|pion, the &s;cavenger whom he had a few months before &s;o &s;everely drubbed.</P>
<P>"There, you dog!" cried the exulting victor, to the di&s;com|fited &s;weep, "down on your marrow-bones, and thank me for your life! By the Lord Harry, if you had fought with that gentleman, you would now have been in the other country: for he licked me, a little while ago, twice as much as I have beat you. So, you dog, I have &s;aved your bacon, and you ought at lea&s;t to give me a guinea."</P>
<P>"Well," cried the gentleman, "my old friend, you are fairly entitled to the guinea, and you &s;hall have it."</P>
<P>He accordingly gave him that &s;um, de&s;iring him to afford the poor devil he had beaten a draught of beer out of it: and away the combatants jogged cordially together, to the next publick-hou&s;e; where they related pretty fairly what had happened&mdash; to the great edification of many of their a&s;&s;embled brethren, who have &s;ince been con&s;iderably more cautious of wantonly giving offence to gentlemen, though &s;ome of the mo&s;t mean and da&s;tardly &s;till occa&s;ionally gratify the native malevolence of their di&s;po&s;itions by making their dirty attacks on ladies. However, as no per&s;on who de&s;erves the name of a gentleman &mdash;or, indeed, of a man&mdash;can tamely &s;ee any female thus in&s;ulted, it is hoped that &s;uch practices, as we become more poli&s;hed and accompli&s;hed, will &s;oon totally decline, and render unnece&s;&s;ary the admini&s;tration of a remedy which, though rough, is not &s;o dangerous as the timid are apt to &s;uppo&s;e, and which, when pro|perly applied, never fails to give at lea&s;t a temporary relief, and &s;eldom to effect a compleat and la&s;ting cure, in that &s;trange malady, &s;o peculiar to the vulgar&mdash;a loathing of decency in dre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>STORY OF A DISABLED VETERAN. SUPPOSED TO BE TOLD BY HIMSELF.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. GOLDSMITH.</BYLINE>
<P>AS for my misfortunes, ma&s;ter, I cannot pretend to have gone through any more than other folks; for except the lo&s;s of my limb, and my being obliged to beg, I don't know any rea&s;on, thank Heaven, that I have to complain. There is Bill Tibbs, of our regiment, he has lo&s;t <HI>both</HI> his legs, and an eye to boot; but, thank Heaven, it is not &s;o bad with me yet. I was born in Shrop&s;hire; my father was a labourer, and died when I was five years old: &s;o I was put upon the pari&s;h. As he had been a wandering &s;ort of a man, the pari&s;hioners were not able to tell to what pari&s;h I belonged, or where I was born; &s;o they &s;ent me to another pari&s;h, and that pari&s;h &s;ent me to a third. I thought in my heart, they kept &s;ending me about &s;o long, that they would not let me be born in any pa|ri&s;h at all; but at la&s;t, however, they fixed me. I had &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition to be a &s;cholar, and was re&s;olved at lea&s;t to know my letters; but the ma&s;ter of the workhou&s;e put me to bu&s;ine&s;s as &s;oon as I was able to handle a mallet; and here I lived an ea&s;y kind of life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and bad my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true, I was not &s;uffered to &s;tir out of the hou&s;e; for fear, as they &s;aid, I &s;hould run away. But what of that! I had the liberty of the whole hou&s;e, and the yard before the door; and that was enough for me. I was then bound out to a farmer; where I was up both early and late, but I eat and drank well, and liked my bu&s;ine&s;s well enough, till he died, when I was obliged to provide for my&s;elf; &s;o I was re&s;olved to go and &s;eek my fortune. In this manner I went from town to town; worked when I could get employment, and &s;tarved when I could get none: when, happening one day to go through a field belonging to a ju&s;tice of peace, I &s;pied a hare cro&s;&s;ing the path ju&s;t before me, and I believe the devil put it into my head to fling my &s;tick at it. Well! what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bringing it away in triumph, when the ju&s;tice him&s;elf met me. He called me a poacher, and a villain; and, collaring me, de&s;ired I would give an account of my&s;elf. I fell on my knees, begged his wor&s;hip's pardon, and began to give a full account of all I knew of my breed, &s;eed, and gene|ration; but though I gave a very good account, the ju&s;tice would not believe a &s;yllable I had to &s;ay: &s;o I was indicted at the &s;e&s;&s;ions; found guilty of being poor, and &s;ent up to Lon|don to Newgate, in order to be tran&s;ported as a vagabond.
<PB N="82" REF="93">People may &s;ay this and that of being in jail; but, for my part, I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in, in all my life. I had my belly-full to eat and drink, and did no work at all. This kind of life was too good to la&s;t for ever; &s;o I was taken out of pri&s;on after five months, put on board a &s;hip, and &s;ent off to the plantations. We had but an indifferent pa&s;&s;age; for, being all confined in the hold, more than a hundred died for want of &s;weet air; and tho&s;e that re|mained were &s;ickly enough, God knows! When we came a&s;hore, we were &s;old to the planters, and I was bound for &s;even years more. As I was no &s;cholar&mdash;for I did not know my letters&mdash;I was obliged to work among the negroes; and I &s;erved out my time as in duty bound to do. When my time was expired, I worked my pa&s;&s;age home; and glad I was to &s;ee Old England again&mdash;becau&s;e I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I &s;hould be indicted for a vagabond once more; &s;o did not much care to go down into the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobs when I could get them. I was very happy in this manner for &s;ome time; till one even|ing, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then de&s;ired me to &s;tand. They belonged to a pre&s;s-gang; I was carried before the ju&s;tice; and, as I could give no account of my&s;elf, I had my choice left whether to go on board a man of war, or li&s;t for a &s;oldier. I cho&s;e the latter; and in this po&s;t of a gentleman I &s;erved two campaigns in Flanders, was at the battles of Val and Fontenoy, and received but one wound through the brea&s;t here; but the doctor of our regiment &s;oon made me well again. When the peace came on, I was di&s;|charged; and as I could not work, becau&s;e my wound was &s;ometimes trouble&s;ome, I li&s;ted for a landman in the Ea&s;t India Company's &s;ervice. I here fought the French in &s;ix pitched battles; and, I verily believe, that if I could read or write, our captain would have made me a corporal. But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion; for I &s;oon fell &s;ick, and &s;o got leave to return home again, with forty pounds in my pocket. This was at the beginning of the late war; and I hoped to be &s;et on &s;hore, and to have the plea&s;ure of &s;pending my money: but the government wanted men; and &s;o I was pre&s;&s;ed for a &s;ailor before ever I could &s;et a foot on &s;hore. The boat&s;wain found me, as he &s;aid, an ob&s;tinate fellow. He &s;wore that he knew that I under&s;tood my bu&s;ine&s;s well, but that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hammed Abram merely to be idle: but, God knows, I knew nothing of &s;ea bu&s;ine&s;s; and he beat me without con&s;idering what he was about. I had &s;till, however, my forty pounds, and that was &s;ome comfort to me under every beating; and the money I might have had to this day, but that our &s;hip was taken by the French, and &s;o I lo&s;t all. Our crew was carried
<PB N="83" REF="94">into Bre&s;t, and many of them died becau&s;e they were not u&s;ed to live in a jail; but for my part it was nothing to me, for I was &s;ea&s;oned. One night, as I was &s;leeping on the bed of boards, with a warm blanket about me&mdash;for I always love to lie well&mdash; I was awakened by the boat&s;wain, who had a dark-lanthorn in his hand. "Jack," &s;ay he to me, "will you knock out the French &s;entries brains?"&mdash;"I don't care," &s;ays I, &s;triving to keep my&s;elf awake, "it I lend a hand!"&mdash;"Then follow me," &s;ays he; and I hope we &s;hall do their bu&s;ine&s;s." So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the cloaths I had, about my middle, and went with him to fight the Frenchmen. I hate the French, becau&s;e they are all &s;laves, and wear wooden|&s;hoes. Though we had no arms, one Engli&s;hman is able to beat five French at any time: &s;o we went down to the door where both &s;entries were po&s;ted; and, ru&s;hing upon them, &s;eized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence nine of us ran together to the quay; and, &s;eizing the fir&s;t boat we met, got &s;afe out of the harbour, and put to &s;ea. We had not been here three days, before we were taken up by the Dor&s;et privateer; who were glad of &s;o many good hands, and we con&s;ented to run our chance. In three days we fell in with the Pompadour privateer, of forty guns, while we had but twenty-three; &s;o to it we went, yard-arm, and yard-arm. The fight la&s;ted for three hours; and I verily believe we &s;hould have taken the Frenchman, had we but had &s;ome more men left behind; but, unfortunately, we lo&s;t all our men ju&s;t as we were going to get the victory. I was once more in the power of the French, and I believe it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to Bre&s;t; but, by good for|tune, we were retaken by the Viper. I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you, that in that engagement I was wounded in two places; I lo&s;t four fingers of the left-hand, and my leg was &s;hot off. If I had had the good fortune to have lo&s;t my leg, and the u&s;e of my hand, on board a king's &s;hip, and not on board a privateer, I &s;hould have been entitled to cloathing and maintenance during the re&s;t of my life; but that was not my chance. One man is born with a &s;ilver &s;poon in his mouth, and another with a wooden-ladle. However, ble&s;&s;ed be God, I enjoy good health; and will for ever love Liberty and Old England. Liberty, Property, and Old England, for ever!</P>

<HEAD>GRADATION FROM A GREENHORN TO A BLOOD. EXTRACTED FROM THE ADVENTURER.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the characters of men have, perhaps, been e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame in all ages, yet their external ap|pearance
<PB N="84" REF="95">has changed with other peculiarities of time and place, and they have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by different names as new modes of expre&s;&s;ion have prevailed: a periodical writer, there|fore, who catches the picture of evane&s;cent life, and &s;hews the deformity of follies which in a few years will be &s;o changed as not to be known, &s;hould be careful to expre&s;s the character when he de&s;cribes the appearance, and to connect it with the name by which it then happens to be called. You have fre|quently u&s;ed the terms. Buck and Blood, and have given &s;ome account of the characters which are thus denominated; but you have not con&s;idered them as the la&s;t &s;tages of a regular progre&s;&s;ion, nor taken any notice of tho&s;e which precede them. Their dependence upon each other is, indeed, &s;o little known, that many &s;uppo&s;e them to be di&s;tinct and collateral cla&s;&s;es, formed by per&s;ons of oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, ta&s;tes, capacities, and di&s;po&s;itions: the &s;cale, however, con&s;i&s;ts of eight degrees; Greenhorn, Jemmy, Je&s;&s;amy, Smart, Hone&s;t Fellow, Joyous Spirit, Buck, and Blood. As I have my&s;elf pa&s;&s;ed through the whole &s;eries, I &s;hall explain each &s;tation by a &s;hort account of my life, remarking the periods when my character changed it's denomination, and the particular incidents by which the change was produced.</P>
<P>My father was a wealthy farmer in York&s;hire; and when I was near eighteen years of age, he brought me to London, and put me apprentice to a con&s;iderable &s;hopkeeper in the city. There was an aukward mode&s;t &s;implicity in my manner, and a reverence of religion and virtue in my conver&s;ation. The novelty of the &s;cene that was now placed before me, in which there were innumerable objects that I never conceived to exi&s;t, rendered me attentive and credulous: peculiarities which, without a provincial accent, a &s;louch in my gait, a long lank head of hair, and an unfa&s;hionable &s;uit of drab-coloured cloth, would have denominated me a Greenhorn; or, in other words, a country put very green.</P>
<P>Green, then, I continued, even in externals, near two years; and in this &s;tate I was the object of univer&s;al contempt and de|ri&s;ion: but being at length wearied with merriment and in&s;ult, I was very &s;edulous to a&s;&s;ume the manners and appearance of tho&s;e who, in the &s;ame &s;tation, were better treated. I had already improved greatly in my &s;peech; and my father having allowed me thirty pounds a year, for apparel and pocket|money, the greater part of which I had &s;aved, I be&s;poke a &s;uit of cloaths of an eminent city-taylor, with &s;everal wai&s;tcoats and breeches, and two frocks for a change; I cut off my hair, and procured a brown bob periwig of Wilding, ju&s;t of the &s;ame colour, with a &s;ingle row of curls round the bottom, which I
<PB N="85" REF="96">wore very nicely combed, and without powder: my hat, which had been cocked with great exactne&s;s in an equilateral triangle, I di&s;carded, and purcha&s;ed one of a more fa&s;hionable &s;ize, the &s;ore corner of which projected near two inches father than tho&s;e on each &s;ide, and was moulded into the &s;hape of a &s;pout: I al&s;o furni&s;hed my&s;elf with a change of white-thread &s;tockings, took care that my pumps were varni&s;hed every morning with the new German blacking-ball; and when I went out, carried in my hand a little &s;witch, which, as it had been long append<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt to the character that I had ju&s;t a&s;&s;umed, has taken the &s;ame name, and is called a Jemmy.</P>
<P>I &s;oon perceived the advantage of this transformation. My manner had not, indeed, kept pace with my dre&s;s; I was &s;till mode&s;t and diffident, temperate and &s;ober, and con&s;equently &s;till &s;ubject to ridicule: but I was now admitted into com|pany from which I had before been excluded by the ru&s;ticity of my appearance; I was raillied and encouraged by turns; and I was in&s;tructed both by precept and example. Some of|fers were made of carrying me to a hou&s;e of private entertain|ment, which then I ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed; but I &s;oon found the way into the play-hou&s;e, to &s;ee the two la&s;t acts and the farce: here I learned that by breaches of cha&s;tity no man was thought to incur either guilt or &s;hame; but that, on the contrary, they were e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the character of a fine gentleman. I &s;oon copied the original, which I found to be univer&s;ally ad|mired, in my morals; and made &s;ome farther approaches to it in my dre&s;s: I &s;uffered my hair to grow long enough to comb back over the foretop of my wig; which, when I &s;allied forth to my evening amu&s;ement, I changed to a queue. I tied the collar of my &s;hirt with half an ell of black ribband, which ap|peared under my neckcloth; the fore-corner of my hat was con&s;iderably elevated and &s;hortened, &s;o that it no longer re|&s;embled a &s;pout, but the corner of a minced pye; my wai&s;tcoat was edged with a narrow lace, my &s;tockings were &s;ilk, and I never appeared without a pair of clean gloves. My addre&s;s, from it's native ma&s;culine plainne&s;s, was converted to an exce&s;s of &s;oftne&s;s and civility, e&s;pecially when I &s;poke to the ladies. I had before made &s;ome progre&s;s in learning to &s;wear; I had proceeded by fegs, faith, pox, plague, 'pon my life, 'pon my &s;oul, rat it, and zookers, to zanns and the devil. I now ad|vanced to by Jove, 'fore ged, ged's cur&s;e it, and demme: but I &s;till uttered the&s;e interjections in a tremulous tone, and my pronounciation was feminine and vicious. I was &s;en&s;ible of my defects, and therefore applied with great diligence to re|move them. I frequently practi&s;ed alone, but it was a long time before I could &s;wear &s;o much to my own &s;atisfaction in
<PB N="86" REF="97">company, as by my&s;elf. My labour, however, was not with|out it's reward; it recommended me to the notice of the la|dies, and procured me the gentle appellation of Je&s;&s;amy.</P>
<P>I now learned, among other Grown Gentlemen, to dance, which greatly enlarged my acquaintance. I entered into a &s;ub&s;cription for country-dances, once a week at a tavern, where each gentleman engaged to bring a partner: at the &s;ame time, I made con&s;iderable advances in &s;wearing. I could pronounce damme with a tolerable air and accent, give the vowel it's full &s;ound, and look with confidence in the face of the per&s;on to whom I &s;poke. About this time, my father's elde&s;t brother died, and left me an e&s;tate of near five hundred pounds per an|num. I now bought out the remainder of my time; and this &s;udden acce&s;&s;ion of wealth and independence gave me immedi|ately an air of greater confidence and freedom. I laid out near one hundred and fifty pounds in cloaths, though I was obliged to go into mourning: I employed a court-taylor to make them up; I exchanged my queue for a bag; I put on a &s;word, which, in appearance at lea&s;t, was a Toledo; and in proportion as I knew my dre&s;s to be elegant, I was le&s;s &s;olici|tous to be neat. My acquaintance now increa&s;ed every hour; I was attended, flattered, and care&s;&s;ed; was often invited to entertainments, fupped every night at a tavern, and went home in a chair; was taken notice of in publick places, and was univer&s;ally confe&s;&s;ed to be improved into a Smart.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome intervals in which I found it nece&s;&s;ary to ab&s;tain from wenching; and in the&s;e, at whatever ri&s;que, I applied my&s;elf to the bottle: a habit of drinking came in&s;en&s;ibly upon me, and I was &s;oon able to walk home with a bottle and a pint. I had learned a &s;ufficient number of fa&s;hionable toa&s;ts, and had got by heart &s;everal toping, and &s;everal bawdy &s;ongs, &s;ome of which I ventured to roar out with a friend hanging on my arm as we &s;coured the &s;treet after our nocturnal revel. I now laboured with indefatigable indu&s;try to increa&s;e tho&s;e ac|qui&s;itions: I enlarged my &s;tock of healths; made great pro|gre&s;s in &s;inging, joking, and &s;tory-telling; &s;wore well; could make a company of &s;taunch topers drunk; always collected the reckoning, and was the la&s;t man that departed. My face began to be covered with red pimples, and my eyes to be weak; I became daily more negligent of my dre&s;s, and more blunt in my manner; I profe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf a foe to &s;tarters and milk&s;ops, declared that there was no enjoyment equal to that of a bottle and a friend, and &s;oon gained the apellation of an Hone&s;t Fellow.</P>
<P>By this di&s;tinction I was animated to attempt yet greater excellence; I learned &s;everal feats of mimickry of the under
<PB N="87" REF="98">players, could take off known characters, tell a &s;taring &s;tory. and humbug with &s;o much &s;kill as &s;ometimes to take-in a knowing one. I was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in the practice of the&s;e arts, to which, indeed, I applied my&s;elf with unwearied diligence and a&s;&s;iduity, that I kept my company roaring with applau&s;e, till their voices &s;unk by degrees, and they were no longer able either to hear or to &s;ee. I had now a&s;cended another &s;cale in the climax; and was acknowledged by all who knew me, to be a Joyous Spirit.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e topicks of merriment were exhau&s;ted, and I had repeated my tricks, my &s;tories, my jokes and my &s;ongs, till they grew in&s;ipid, I became mi&s;chievous; and was continu|ally devi&s;ing and executing Frolicks, to the un&s;peakable delight of my companions, and the injury of others, For many of them I was pro&s;ecuted, and frequently obliged to pay large damages: but I bore all the&s;e lo&s;es with an air of jovial indif|ference. I pu&s;hed on in my career; I was more de&s;perate in proportion as I had le&s;s to lo&s;e; and being deterred from no mi&s;chief by the dread of it's con&s;equences, I was &s;aid to run at all, and was complimented by the name of a Buck.</P>
<P>My e&s;tate was at length mortgaged for more than it was worth; creditors were importunate; I became neglectful of my|&s;elf and others; I made a de&s;perate effort at the gaming-table, and lo&s;t the la&s;t &s;um that I could rai&s;e; my e&s;tate was &s;eized by the mortgagee; I learned to pack cards, and to cog a die; became a bully to whores; pa&s;&s;ed my nights in a brothel, the &s;treet, or the watch-hou&s;e; was utterly in &s;en&s;ible of &s;hame; and lived upon the town as a bea&s;t of prey in a fore&s;t. Thus I reached the &s;ummit of modern glory; and had ju&s;t acquired the character of a blood, when I was arre&s;ted for an old debt of three hundred pounds, and thrown into the King's Bench Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e characters, Sir, though they are di&s;tinct, yet do not at all differ, otherwi&s;e than as &s;hades of the &s;ame colour; and, though they are &s;tages of a regular progre&s;&s;ion, yet the whole progre&s;s is not made by every individual: &s;ome are &s;o &s;oon initi|ated in the my&s;teries of the town, that they are never publickly known in their Green-horn &s;tate; others &s;ix long in the Jem|myhood, others are Je&s;&s;amys at four&s;core, and &s;ome &s;tagnate in each of the higher &s;tages for life. But I reque&s;t that they may never hereafter be confounded, either by you or your cor|re&s;pondents. Of the Blood, your brother adventurer, Mr. Wildgoo&s;e, though he a&s;&s;umes the character, does not &s;eem to have a ju&s;t and preci&s;e idea as di&s;tinct from the Buck, in which cla&s;s he &s;hould be placed, and will probably die; for he &s;eems determined to &s;hoot him&s;elf ju&s;t at the time when
<PB N="88" REF="99">his circum&s;tances will enable him to a&s;&s;ume the higher di&s;|tinctions.</P>
<P>But the retro&s;pect upon life, which this letter has made ne|ce&s;&s;ary, covers me with confu&s;ion, and aggravates de&s;pair. I cannot but reflect that, among all the&s;e characters, I have never a&s;&s;umed that of a Man. Man is a Rea&s;onable Being; which he cea&s;es to be, who di&s;gui&s;es his body with ridiculous fopperies, or degrades his mind by dete&s;table brutality. The&s;e thoughts would have been of great u&s;e to me if they had occur|red &s;even years ago. If they are of u&s;e to you, I hope you will &s;end me a &s;mall gratuity for my labour, to alleviate the mi&s;ery of hunger and nakedne&s;s: but, dear Sir, let your bounty be &s;peedy, le&s;t I peri&s;h before it arrive.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GOOD PEOPLE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have heard my drum, and now it is my turn. It is a common &s;aying, that the king cannot make a gentle|man: but, look you, he that uttered it fir&s;t, whether herald to Tom Thumb, or Jack the Giant-Killer, lyed in his throat; for whoever can be&s;tow arms, can make a gentleman. Now, &s;imple as I &s;tand here, the king has be&s;towed arms on me, wherefore I am a gentleman; and, if it is my good will and plea&s;ure, I can tran&s;late a &s;core or two of you to the &s;ame ho|nour. And what can you do better? You are now a pack of dirty, meagre, ragamuffin &s;coundrels; &s;laves to your ma&s;ters, drudges to your wives, and the property of gin-&s;hops, ale|hou&s;es, pawn-brokers, and exci&s;emen: whereas, take but this piece of gold, and handle this brown mu&s;ket, your debts are di&s;charged, the king's your pay-ma&s;ter, your wives may hang them&s;elves, and you may live at free quarter upon other peo|ple's. To make &s;hort of my &s;tory, you become as good gen|tlemen as I am: and, on the &s;trength of your &s;word, may take the wall of a better man when you plea&s;e. But, perhaps, you have no great &s;tomach for fighting; you may fancy the Spaniards &s;ea&s;on their oglios with Engli&s;hmen's ears, and &s;o|forth. Never fear! threatened folks live longe&s;t. And I my|&s;elf have been in the &s;ervice, man and boy, the&s;e five and twenty years, and never once looked an enemy in the face. Lord help you! if Chel&s;ea College was to be filled with none but &s;uch as had lo&s;t their eyes, ears, or no&s;es, in the field of battle, the income might, in time, be turned over to Green|wich

The Power above, to whom we owe our being, has taken us into his protection and favour; and has determined that not a hair of our heads &s;hall fall to the ground. Nay, if we &s;eem to be in danger, he makes it his bu&s;ine&s;s to deliver us; and if our enemies plot our de&s;truction, he never fails to confound them. Oh! but the wags make them&s;elves merry with mu&s;ters and reviews, powder and cockades, and &s;o-forth. Why let them; they pay dear enough for their jokes, God knows! And, if they have wit and common &s;en&s;e on their &s;ide, we have abu&s;e and Billing&s;gate on ours: among friends, a whole legion of Gar|reteers, gentlemen, who indite curiou&s;ly, are bound, by their articles, to defend us; to defend us from being di&s;banded in time of peace, and from being employed in time of war; nay, more, to pen chronicles of our exploits, and take their Bible oaths that a cockle-&s;hell is a Spani&s;h pi&s;tole.</P>
<P>But, good people&mdash;gentlemen I would call you; but, as I &s;aid before, you mu&s;t fir&s;t bear arms&mdash;not to lead you beyond your depth, fleece or be fleeced is the word! and, whether it is be&s;t to be the &s;heep or the &s;hearer, judge for your&s;elves.

<HEAD>PLATE V. THE IDLE 'PRENTICE TURNED AWAY, AND SENT TO SEA.</HEAD>
<P>THE good Mr. We&s;t, wearied with the vain expectation of &s;eeing any amendment in his vicious apprentice, Thomas Idle, and finding, on the contrary, that he grew &s;till wor&s;e and wor&s;e; as a la&s;t effort to &s;ave the youth from total de&s;truction, by dividing him from his profligate companions, he procured him to be &s;ent on board a man of war. The di&s;|cipline of the navy; he well knew, mu&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure cor|rect indolent habits; and he hoped that the youth might yet be made a u&s;eful member of &s;ociety. This print accordingly pre|&s;ents our unpromi&s;ing hero, in the &s;hip's boat, accompanied by his mourning mother, who&s;e dre&s;s denotes her widowhood; and gives ri&s;e to the reflection, that &s;he is thus re&s;igning her la&s;t hope, the once fondly cheri&s;hed &s;olace and &s;upport of her de|clining years!</P>
<P>In the mean time, while the waterman is rowing coolly along, and &s;moking the pipe of indifference, with all a Dutch|man's frigidity, one man in the boat &s;arca&s;tically points to a pirate hanging in chains on a gibbet, as an emblem of Tom's future de&s;tiny; and the other, with an elevated cat-o'-nine-tails, di&s;played in a menacing way to the culprit, be&s;peaks the pre|vious cha&s;ti&s;ement he may expect at &s;ea. The&s;e hints he receives without emotion; and, to evince his equal talent for raillery, di&s;plays two fingers held up as horns, and calls the married man's attention to Cuckold's Point, which at that in|&s;tant

<HEAD>SERMON ON THE WORD MALT. PREACHED BY THE REV. MR. DODD, IN A HOLLOW TREE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Rev. Mr. Dodd, a very worthy mini&s;ter, who lived a few miles from Cambridge, had rendered him&s;elf ob|noxious to many of the Cantabs by frequently preaching again&s;t drunkenne&s;s; &s;everal of whom meeting him on a jour|ney, they determined to make him preach in a hollow tree which was near the road-&s;ide. Accordingly, addre&s;&s;ing him with great apparent politene&s;s, they a&s;ked him if he had not lately preached much again&s;t drunkenne&s;s. On his replying in the affirmative, they in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould now preach from a text of their chu&s;ing. In vain did he remon&s;trate on the un|rea&s;onablene&s;s of expecting him to give them a di&s;cour&s;e with|out &s;tudy, and in &s;uch a place; they were determined to take no denial, and the word MALT was given him by way of text: on which he immediately delivered him&s;elf as follows&mdash;</P>
<P>"BELOVED, let me crave your attention&mdash;I am a little man, come at a &s;hort warning, to preach a &s;hort &s;ermon from a &s;mall &s;ubject, in an unworthy pulpit, to a &s;mall congregation. Beloved, my text is MALT: I cannot divide it into words, it being but one; nor into &s;yllables, it being but one: I mu&s;t, therefore, of nece&s;&s;ity, divide it into letters, which I find to be the&s;e four, M&mdash;A&mdash;L&mdash;T.</P>
<P>"M, my beloved, is Moral&mdash;A, is Allegorical&mdash;L, is Li|teral&mdash;T, is Theological. The Moral is &s;et forth to teach you drunkards good-manners; therefore, M, Ma&s;ters&mdash;A, All of you&mdash;L, Li&s;ten&mdash;T, to my Text. The Allegorical is when
<PB N="99" REF="113">one thing is &s;poken, and another thing is meant. The thing &s;poken of is Malt: the thing meant, is the juice of Mait; which you Cantabs make&mdash;M, your Ma&s;ter&mdash;A, your A ppa|rel &mdash;L, your Liberty&mdash;and T, your Tru&s;t. The Literal is, according to the Letter&mdash;M, Much&mdash;A, Ale&mdash;L, Little&mdash;T, Tru&s;t. The Theological is according to the effects that it works; and the&s;e I find to be of two kinds: fir&s;t, in this world; &s;econdly, in the world to come. The effects that it works in this world are, in &s;ome&mdash;M, Murder&mdash;in others, A, Adultery &mdash;in all, L, Loo&s;ene&s;s of Life&mdash;and, in &s;ome, T, Trea&s;on. The effects that it works in the world to come&mdash;are, M, Mi|&s;ery&mdash;A, Angui&s;h&mdash;L, Lamentation&mdash;and T, Torment. And &s;o much for this time and text.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall improve this: fir&s;t, by way of exhortation&mdash;M, Ma&s;ters&mdash;A, All of you&mdash;L, Leave off&mdash;T, Tipling; or, &s;e|condly, by way of excommunication&mdash;M, Ma&s;ters&mdash;A, All of you&mdash;L, Look for&mdash;T, Torment. Thirdly, by way of cau|tion, take this: A drunkard is the annoyance of mode&s;ty, the &s;poil of civility, the de&s;truction of rea&s;on, the brewer's agent, the alehou&s;e benefactor, his wife's &s;orrow, his children's trou|ble, his own &s;hame, his neighbour's &s;coff, a walking &s;will-bowl, the picture of a bea&s;t, and the mon&s;ter of a man.</P>
<P>"Now to," &amp;c.</P>
<P>He then concluded in the u&s;ual form; and the young men, plea&s;ed with his ingenuity, not only &s;incerely thanked him, but ab&s;olutely profited more by this &s;hort and whim&s;ical &s;ermon, than by any &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e they had ever heard.</P>

<HEAD>PROPOSED HOSPITAL FOR DECAYED AUTHORS.</HEAD>
<P>I Sit down to write in behalf of a &s;et of gentlemen in this town, called Authors; who&s;e appearance in publick, for many prudent rea&s;ons, being &s;eldom, and their habitations far above the common level with the re&s;t of mankind, they pa&s;s unnoticed by the generality of the world, and are looked upon by others as a name without a being,</P>
<P>From whence this want of re&s;pect for &s;o con&s;iderable a body of men proceeds, I will not take upon me to &s;ay; but, certain it is, that many worthy wits by profe&s;&s;ion are &s;tarving in gar|rets, while the gravitation of dulne&s;s daily brings hundreds to and from the Exchange, and the neighbouring alleys, in their chariots.</P>
<P>What a &s;ad reflection it is, that the mo&s;t beautiful ode in Horace will not rai&s;e &s;ixpence in the city, when an ordinary
<PB N="100" REF="114">knowledge of the multiplication-table will accumulate e&s;tates I This unaccountable humour in the nation, of preferring the writings of the Bank directors to tho&s;e of the &s;ons of Parna&s;&s;us, has reduced many a fine poetical genius to darn his own &s;tock|ings.</P>
<P>A friend of mine, who accidentally became acquainted with two or three of the&s;e great men, who nobly defy poverty for the &s;ake of exhibiting their extraordinary talents, took me one day to vi&s;it them in their occupation. We were led by the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e where they lodged, a book&s;eller by trade, up a very hand&s;ome pair of &s;tairs, where I imagined we &s;hould have been introduced to the literati on the fir&s;t floor; but, how great was my &s;urprize, to be conducted up two or three &s;tories more, and then up a ladder into a cock-loft! where eight or nine of the&s;e illu&s;trious &s;pirits were amu&s;ing them&s;elves with compo&s;itions of various &s;orts: not, as our guide &s;eemed to in&s;inuate, for the lucre of porter and pudding, but from the noble motive of benefiting mankind by their lucubrations. I mu&s;t own, their un&s;uitable &s;ituation made me feel &s;ome concern for them, though they &s;eemed to have very little for them&s;elves. But my attention to their deplorable circum&s;tances was inter|rupted by a mi&s;take, that my ignorance of their trade led me into; for, after the fir&s;t introductory &s;alutations were over, they fell again to their former employments, without taking any farther notice of us; and, as I was very attentive, out of curio&s;ity, I heard one of them call &s;oftly acro&s;s the table to an|other who &s;at oppo&s;ite to him&mdash;"Pr'ythee, Matt. Prior, lend me thy &s;imile of the bird's-ne&s;t."</P>
<P>On my expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome &s;urprize at the name of Matt. Prior, my friend whi&s;pered me, that every one of the gentlemen per|&s;onated &s;ome poet of note, and imitated, as well as they were able, his &s;tile; and that &s;uch compo&s;itions were publi&s;hed under the titles of Remains, Po&s;thumous Works, &amp;c. I can|not &s;ay, but my indignation began to be kindled at a proceed|ing &s;o injurious to the decea&s;ed, had not an object of a different nature excited my laughter; for while the&s;e deputy harmoni&s;ts were coupling their rhimes together, an old woman of a ve|nerable a&s;pect mounted the ladder, and informed the company that the milk-porridge was ready: the pens were in&s;tantly &s;luck behind their ears, the ink remained in peace, and the &s;ound of beams, purling &s;treams, loves, doves, and groves, was heard no more.</P>
<P>I imagined, as &s;oon as the vi&s;it was over, that my acquaint|ance with the&s;e &s;ons of the Mu&s;es would be &s;o too: but I very &s;oon after found my error; for, as I was walking in St. James's Park the next Sunday, I ob&s;erved three gentlemen in ru&s;ty phi|lo&s;ophical
<PB N="101" REF="115">black coats, bra&s;s-hilted &s;words, and tye-wigs, ri&s;ing up from one of the benches to meet me. When they were come a little nearer, I perceived one of them to be my old friend the &s;imile-lender, the worthy repre&s;entative of Matt. Prior, who acco&s;ted me with the mo&s;t obliging conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>As our conver&s;ation, during my &s;tay in the Park, was pretty long, I &s;hall not trouble you with a particular account of it, any farther than to acquaint you that it began with animad|verting on the damned ta&s;te of the town, as they called it; and concluded with their borrowing half a crown apiece of me. Such is the condition of many a great &s;oul in this kingdom; who, magnanimou&s;ly &s;corning to engro&s;s, to pound in a mor|tar, or live like any other vile mechanick, has rather cho&s;e to confine him&s;elf &s;ix days in &s;even, feeling the inward call of a poetical &s;pirit, than breathe the &s;ame air with the illiterate mul|titude! As many hundreds, therefore, are led into great in|conveniences, not by their own faults, but by this writing devil that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them, I think it would be a charity altogether worthy of the pre&s;ent publick &s;pirit, to found an ho&s;pital for nece&s;&s;itous authors; &s;uch, I mean, as are not quite furious; for tho&s;e, of cour&s;e, will be admitted into that founded by the late Dean of St. Patrick's for lunaticks; and, as no &s;cheme of this &s;ort has hitherto been laid before the publick, I beg leave to in&s;ert the following in your Mi&s;eellany.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing to be con&s;idered is a proper &s;pot to build an ho&s;pital on; for which I think Tothill Fields would be very convenient, as they lie contiguous to the banks of the fertile Thames, who&s;e &s;treams have been the &s;ubject of &s;o many fine compo&s;itions, and may &s;erve to recal, even in old age, the ideas of their former rapture. The &s;tructure &s;hould be of the old Gothick collegiate architecture, containing about two hun|dred apartments; not regular and uniform, but of different &s;izes, &amp;c. according to the different geniu&s;es and di&s;po&s;itions of tho&s;e that are to be admitted.</P>
<P>In this point, too, the &s;ituation of the chambers ought to be ob&s;erved; for in&s;tance, the compilers of vade-mecums, abridgement-makers, &amp;c. &s;hould be &s;tationed in the cellars under-ground; the ode-writers, next to the &s;ky-light; the tran&s;lators, on the ground-floor; and the epick and dramatick authors, on the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;tories. In the mid&s;t of the whole I would have a large hall, where the whole &s;ociety &s;hould meet three times a day, to be provided at every meal with di&s;hes adapted to their con&s;titutions; for care mu&s;t be had, that the gentlemen who &s;oar "above the vi&s;ible diurnal &s;phere," do not eat of beef, or any other meat that is &s;ubject to clog the intellects; but be fed, as Pindar and the bards of old were, with food that elates and puts the fancy on the wing.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="116">This college &s;hould be governed by a pre&s;ident and twelve directors; all of whom &s;hould have been book&s;ellers in London for the &s;pace of &s;even years before the time they are elected &s;uch, that they may be thereby qualified to judge properly of the preten&s;ions of the candidates to this charity. Every can|didate mu&s;t have the recommendation of one or more of the di|rectors, and a certificate under the hands and &s;eals of four of the company of Stationers, that he has been mu&s;e-rid for ten years, in &s;uch a manner as to be entirely incapacitated for any other vocation in life. If the&s;e things &s;eem clear, the per&s;on &s;hall be admitted without farther trouble, except he is proved to be worth money; for a rich man mu&s;t be as incapable to enter this ho&s;pital "as the kingdom of heaven."</P>
<P>We next come to the choice of proper &s;ervants and attend|ants. Now, as there are in the three kingdoms innumerable footmen and chambermaids, who &s;pend be&s;t part of their time with Lee and Otway, and daily condemn Fate for having placed people of their uncommon talents in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as to be &s;ubject to be called every moment from the heroick com|pany of Alexander and Roxana, and &s;ent to conver&s;e, much again&s;t their inclination, with the dregs of the people; I would have &s;uch as are di&s;po&s;ed to live retired, and to have frequent opportunities of conver&s;ing not only with dead poets, but living wits, come and offer their &s;ervice to the ho&s;pital, where they &s;hall be furni&s;hed with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for life, and be allowed, after the little labour that &s;hall be required of them is over, &s;tated hours for their favourite &s;tudies.</P>
<P>When the&s;e things are all &s;ettled, and a hand&s;ome &s;ub&s;crip|tion is opened, the legi&s;lature, no doubt, will give encourage|ment to &s;o noble, u&s;eful, and charitable a foundation, by e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the lands and funds rai&s;ed for it's &s;upport by parlia|mentary authority; and, if it would not be looked on as pre|&s;umption to give a hint to &s;o wi&s;e and augu&s;t an a&s;&s;embly, a tax might be laid, which would bring in va&s;t &s;ums annually, and at the &s;ame time be no burden to the indu&s;trious &s;ubject, but tend, on the contrary, to promote every branch of trade in the nation.</P>
<P>The tax I mean, &s;hould be laid on that unprofitable commo|dity which abounds &s;o much in the&s;e kingdoms, commonly called Scribbling. There &s;hould be in every pari&s;h an in&s;pec|tor into this manufactory&mdash;the par&s;on, for in&s;tance&mdash;who &s;hould take his rounds once a week, like the exci&s;eman, to vi|&s;it tho&s;e who are dealers, and receive the limited duty: and, in order to obviate any fraud, very large penalties might be laid on all &s;uch as &s;hould clande&s;tinely make ver&s;e or pro&s;e, or a mixture of both, which I think is mo&s;t in reque&s;t at pre&s;ent,
<PB N="103" REF="117">without previou&s;ly acquainting the eccle&s;ia&s;tical officer, or at lea&s;t informing him immediately after. This expence would hinder many an attorney's clerk and apprentice from Philising away his time, and keep him from being reduced at la&s;t to the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Should it be objected by the proprietors of other periodical mi&s;cellanies, that &s;uch tax would deprive them of many inge|nious performances, both in ver&s;e and pro&s;e; the grievances may be redre&s;&s;ed by applying to the directors, and compound|ing with them at &s;o much a year for all their authors in a lump, as tho&s;e people do with commi&s;&s;ioners of turnpikes who live near the gate.</P>
<P>Having thrown together the&s;e loo&s;e thoughts, I leave the publick to improve my project, and &s;hall be happy to &s;ub&s;cribe my mite for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an in&s;titution.</P>

<HEAD>THE CHOICE SPIRIT.</HEAD>
<P>THAT a trade&s;man has no bu&s;ine&s;s with humour, unle&s;s, perhaps, in the way of his dealing, or with writing, un|le&s;s in his &s;hop-book, is a truth which I believe nobody will di&s;pute with me. I am &s;o unfortunate, however, as to have a nephew who, not contented with being a grocer, is in dan|ger of ab&s;olute ruin by his ambition of being a Wit; and hav|ing for&s;aken his counter for <HI>Comus's Court,</HI> and dignified him|&s;elf with the appellation of a <HI>Choice Spirit,</HI> is on the point of becoming a bankrupt. In&s;tead of di&s;tributing his &s;hop|bills as he ought, he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tes a dozen in the morning, by &s;crib|bling &s;hreds of his non&s;en&s;e on the backs of them; and, a few days &s;ince, affronted an alderman, his be&s;t cu&s;tomer, by &s;end|ing him a pound of prunes wrapped up in a ballad he had ju&s;t written, called, <HI>The Citizen outwitted, or a Bob for the Man|&s;ion-hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>He is, likewi&s;e, a regular frequenter of the play-hou&s;es; and, being acquainted with every underling of each theatre, is at an annual expence of ten pounds in tickets for their re|&s;pective benefits. They generally adjourn together from the play to the tavern; and there is hardly a watchman, within a mile of Covent Garden, but has had his head, or his lantern, broke by one or other of the ingenious fraternity.</P>
<P>I turned into his &s;hop this morning, and had no &s;ooner &s;et my foot on the thre&s;hold, than he leaped over the counter, threw him&s;elf into an attitude, as he calls it; and a&s;ked me, in the words of &s;ome play that I remember to have &s;een formerly, whether I was <HI>a &s;pirit of health, or a goblin damn'd?</HI> I told him he was an undutiful young dog, for daring to acco&s;t his
<PB N="104" REF="118">uncle in that irreverent manner; and bade him &s;peak like a Chri&s;tian, and a rea&s;onable per&s;on. In&s;tead of being &s;en&s;ible of my rebuke, he took off his wig; and, having very delibe|rately given it two or three twirls on his fi&s;t, and pitching it on his head again, &s;aid, I was a dry old quiz, and &s;hould cer|tainly afford them much entertainment at the club, to which he had the impudence to invite me: at the &s;ame time, he thru&s;t a card into my hand, containing a bill of fare for the evening's entertainment; and, as a farther inducement, a&s;&s;ured me that Mr. Twi&s;ter him&s;elf would be in the chair; that he was a wonderful creature, and &s;o prodigiou&s;ly droll, that though he had heard him &s;ing the &s;ame &s;ongs, and repeat the &s;ame &s;tories, a thou&s;and times, he could &s;till attend to him with as much plea&s;ure as at fir&s;t. I ca&s;t my eye over the li&s;t, and can re|collect the following items&mdash;
<Q>"To all true Lovers of Fun and Jocularity.</Q></P>
<P>"Mr. Twi&s;ter will this evening take off a cat worried by two bull-dogs; ditto, making love in a gutter; the knife-grinder and his wheel; High-Dutch &s;quabble; and a hog in a &s;laughter-hou&s;e."</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured him that, &s;o far from having any reli&s;h for the&s;e dete&s;table noi&s;es, the more they re&s;embled the originals, the le&s;s I &s;hould like them: and, if I could ever be fool enough to go, &s;hould at lea&s;t be wi&s;e enough to &s;top my ears till I came out again.</P>
<P>Having lamented my deplorable want of ta&s;te, by the eleva|tion of his eye-brows, and a &s;ignificant &s;hrug of his &s;houlders, he thru&s;t his fore-finger again&s;t the in&s;ide of his cheek, and plucking it out of his mouth with a jerk, made a noi&s;e that very much re&s;embled the drawing of a cork. I found that, by this &s;ignal, he meant to a&s;k me if I cho&s;e a whet? I gave my con&s;ent, by a &s;ulky kind of nod, and walked into the back room, as much a&s;hamed of my nephew as he ought to have been of him&s;elf. While he was gone to fetch a pint of Moun|tain from the other &s;ide of the &s;treet, I had an opportunity to minute down a few of the articles of which the litter of his apartment con&s;i&s;ted; and have &s;elected the&s;e, as the mo&s;t material, from among them&mdash;</P>
<P>On one of the &s;conces by the chimney, a &s;mart grizzle bob|wig, well oiled and powdered, feather topped, and bag-fronted.</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENTS ON THE CAT-ORGAN. ADDRESSED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Need not inform per&s;ons of your infinite experience and erudition, that the Cat-Organ, as it has hitherto been made u&s;e of, was no more than what followeth, viz. A plain harp&s;ichord; which, in&s;tead of having &s;trings and jacks, con|&s;i&s;ts of Cats of different &s;izes, included in boxes, who&s;e voices expre&s;s every note in the gamut, which is extorted from the impri&s;oned animals by placing their tails in grooves, which are properly &s;queezed by the impre&s;&s;ion of the organi&s;t's fingers on the keys. This in&s;trument, unimproved as it was, I have often heard with incredible delight, but e&s;pecially in the grand and plaintive. This delight grew upon me every time I was pre&s;ent at it's performance. At length I &s;hut my&s;elf up for &s;e|ven years, to &s;tudy &s;ome additions and improvements, which I have at length accompli&s;hed, agreeable to my warme&s;t wi&s;hes; and which I with all due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion now lay before you.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, then, it is univer&s;ally known and acknow|ledged, that the&s;e animals, at the time of their amours, are the mo&s;t mu&s;ical creatures in nature; I would therefore recom|mend it to all and &s;ingular Cat-Organi&s;ts, to have a mo&s;t e&s;pe|cial
<PB N="107" REF="121">regard to the time of caterwauling, particularly if they have anything very augu&s;t or affecting to exhibit.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is al&s;o very well known that the be&s;t voices are improved by ca&s;tration; I therefore never have le&s;s than eight geldings in my treble clef. And here I cannot help informing you of an experiment I lately made on an Italian boar-cat, and and Engli&s;h one of the &s;ame gender; and I &s;olemnly prote&s;t that, after the operation, my country animal had every whit as delicate, piercing, and comprehen&s;ive a tone, as the foreigner: and I make no &s;ort of doubt that &s;ome of our harmonious Eng|li&s;hmen would &s;hine with an equal lu&s;tre, if they had the &s;ame advantages as the Italians. This may be worth the con&s;idera|tion of people in power: for, if this experiment had been tried with &s;ucce&s;s, how many thou&s;and pounds would it have &s;aved this nation!</P>
<P>Thirdly. Of the Forte and Piano. I mu&s;t not omit to tell you, gentlemen, that my Cat-Organ re&s;embles a double harp|&s;ichord; for, as that has two rows of keys, &s;o mine has two layers of Cats, both of a le&s;&s;er &s;ize, and who&s;e tails are &s;queezed by a much le&s;s pre&s;&s;ure; that is, by nothing but the bare ex|tremity of the key. But the lower row, on which I play forte, or loudly, contains an harmonious &s;ociety of banging grimalkins; and who&s;e tails are &s;everely pricked by bra&s;s pins, in&s;erted at the end of the key for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Of the Shake. There was one enormous defect in this in&s;trument, before I took it in hand, and that was in the &s;hake; the imperfection of which gave me great offence. But, as it is now managed, it has the mo&s;t ravi&s;hing effect in the world. There are between all the keys little wires fixed almo&s;t imperceptibly; the&s;e go underneath till they reach each pu&s;s's throat: at the extremity of the&s;e wires are placed hori|zontally wrens quills, about the length of a quarter of an inch. When the arti&s;t, therefore, has a mind to form his &s;hake, he touches the wires, which &s;oon &s;end the quills in a tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, up to the Cat's throat, and cau&s;es the mo&s;t gur|gling, warbling, &s;haking, quaking, trembling, murmuring &s;ound, in the world.</P>
<P>Fifthly. Of the Staccato, and an infallible method of keep|ing the four-footed performers under proper regulations.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t intolerable deficiency of the old Cat-Organ was as follows: &s;ome of the Cats were apt to continue their mew after the proper note was expre&s;&s;ed, to the great confu&s;ion of the tune, and vexation of the organi&s;t. This I have entirely cured; and, I think, I can play the mo&s;t perfect &s;taccato in the world. I have underneath my in&s;trument a treddle, like that of a &s;pinning-wheel, which I work with my foot: this
<PB N="108" REF="122">treddle actuates a certain number of forceps or pincers, which open and &s;hut, at my plea&s;ure, upon the no&s;es and chins of all the Cats; and if any of them over-act their part, I tip St. Dun&s;tan upon Mrs. Pu&s;s, and &s;he is obliged of nece&s;&s;ity to be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Sixthly. Of the education of Cats for the Organ. My pre|dece&s;&s;ors were egregiou&s;ly out in this article, as well as many others; which, whatever it may appear to the incredulous or incurious, is a matter of importance. With regard to their diet, milk and flummery, fried mice and fi&s;h, have the be&s;t ef|fect; I mean, for the trebles and tenors: as for the ba&s;es, I have fed them with good &s;ucce&s;s on bullock's liver, hog's har&s;let's, and &s;ometimes with viands of a much le&s;s delicate nature. As for exerci&s;e, moderate mou&s;ing, and being well tugged and hauled about by the children, will very well &s;uffice.</P>
<P>Mr. Collier, in his E&s;&s;ay on Mu&s;ick, &s;ays&mdash;that he makes no doubt that there might be a warlike in&s;trument contrived, of &s;uch an hideous &s;ound, that in&s;tead of in&s;piring men with cou|rage, it would &s;trike the mo&s;t undaunted with di&s;may. This may be effected by the above-mentioned in&s;trument: for though the Cat-Organ, when accurately in tune, is incomparably me|lodious, yet it may be &s;o managed, as to utter &s;hrieks very lit|tle inferior to the cries of the infernals them&s;elves. Happy that in&s;trument, where terror and tran&s;port, ornament and utility, are &s;o exqui&s;itely blended! which, by it's per&s;ua&s;ive harmony, can at one time draw St. Cecilia from the &s;pheres; and, at another, with proper alteration, would frighten away the devil him&s;elf in propri&acirc; per&s;on&acirc;!</P>

<HEAD>THE WOODEN SWORD. A POPISH MIRACLE.</HEAD>

<P>ONE Richard Middleton, a private &s;oldier, attending di|vine &s;ervice with the re&s;t of the regiment, at a church in Gla&s;gow, in&s;tead of pulling out a bible, like his brother &s;oldiers, in order to &s;earch for the text, &s;pread a pack of cards before him. This &s;ingular behaviour did not long pa&s;s unno|ticed, either by the mini&s;ter, or the &s;erjeant of the company to which he belonged: the latter, in particular, commanded him to put up his cards; and, on his refu&s;al, conducted him, after divine &s;ervice, before the chief magi&s;trate, to whom he preferred a formal complaint of Richard's irreverend behaviour. "Well, &s;oldier," &s;aid the magi&s;trate, "what excu&s;e have you to offer for this &s;trange and &s;candalous behaviour?

<HEAD>TYTHE IN KIND; OR, THE SOW'S REVENGE ON THE PARSON. A TALE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. FISHER.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>NOT far from London liv'd a boor,</L>
<L>Who fed three dozen hogs, or more;</L>
<L>Alike remote from care and &s;trife,</L>
<L>He crack'd his joke, and lov'd his wife.</L>
<L>Madge, like all women, fond of &s;way,</L>
<L>Was pleas'd whene'er &s;he had her way;</L>
<L>And wives will think I deal in fiction,</L>
<L>But &s;eldom met with contradiction:</L>
<L><PB N="115" REF="129">Then, &s;tubborn as the &s;wine &s;he fed,</L>
<L>She neither would be driven nor led;</L>
<L>And Goodman Hodge, who knew her whim,</L>
<L>Was kind, nor row'd again&s;t the &s;tream.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Subdu'd by Nature's primal law,</L>
<L>Young &s;ows are ever in the &s;traw:</L>
<L>Each week, &s;o genial Fate decreed,</L>
<L>Produc'd a new and numerous breed.</L>
<L>Whene'er they came, &s;edate and kind,</L>
<L>The vicar was not far behind;</L>
<L>Of pigs the worth and prime he knew,</L>
<L>And, par&s;on like, would have his due.</L>
<L>He watch'd the hour with anxious ken;</L>
<L>His heart grew warm at number ten:</L>
<L>The younger pigs he vow'd the &s;weeter,</L>
<L>And &s;carce allow'd them time to litter.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One morn, with &s;mile and bow polite,</L>
<L>From Hodge he claim'd his cu&s;tom'd right;</L>
<L>But fir&s;t enquir'd, in accents mild,</L>
<L>How far'd the darling wife and child;</L>
<L>How apples, pears, and turnips grew,</L>
<L>And if the ale were old or new.</L>
<L>Hodge, who from cu&s;tom took the hint,</L>
<L>Knew 'twas in vain a prie&s;t to &s;tint;</L>
<L>And, while his rev'rence took his &s;wig,</L>
<L>Hodge &s;tepp'd a&s;ide, and brought the pig.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Humph!" cried the par&s;on, "let us &s;ee</L>
<L>This offering to the church and me:</L>
<L>I fear, my friend, 'twill never do;</L>
<L>Methinks 'tis lean, and &s;ickly too.</L>
<L>Time out of mind 't has been confe&s;s'd,</L>
<L>Par&s;ons &s;hould ever claim the be&s;t."</L>
<L>This &s;aid, he ey'd it o'er and o'er;</L>
<L>Stamp'd, &s;et his wig, and all but &s;wore.</L>
<L>"Such pig for me! why, man alive,</L>

<L>Think you for this I preach and pray?</L>
<L>Hence! bring me better tythes, I &s;ay"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hodge heard; and, and tho' by nature warm,</L>
<L>Replied&mdash; "Kind Sir, I meant no harm:</L>
<L>Since what I proffer you refu&s;e,</L>
<L>The &s;tye is open, pick and chu&s;e."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pleas'd with the offer, in he goes&mdash;</L>
<L>His heart with exultation glows;</L>
<L>He rolls his eyes, his lip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he licks,</L>
<L>And &s;carce can tell on when to fix:</L>
<L><PB N="116" REF="130">At length he cries&mdash;"Heav'n &s;ave the king!</L>
<L>This rogue in black is ju&s;t the thing!</L>
<L>Hence &s;hall I gain a rich regale!"</L>
<L>Nor more; but &s;eiz'd it by the tail.</L>
<L>Loud &s;queak'd the pig; the &s;ow was near&mdash;</L>
<L>The piercing &s;ound a&s;&s;ail'd her ear:</L>
<L>Eager to &s;ave her darling young,</L>
<L>Fierce on the bending prie&s;t &s;he &s;prung;</L>

<L>A foe &s;o de&s;p'rate clo&s;e behind:</L>
<L>On Hodge, on Madge, he calls for aid;</L>
<L>But both were deaf to all he &s;aid.</L>
<L>The &s;cene a numerous circle draws,</L>
<L>Who hail the &s;ow with loud applau&s;e:</L>

<L>"Tythe!" cried the par&s;on&mdash;"Tythe, dy'e &s;ay?</L>
<L>See here&mdash;one half is rent away!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The ca&s;e, 'tis true, was mo&s;t forlorn;</L>
<L>His gown, his wig, his breech was torn:</L>
<L>And what the milde&s;t prie&s;t might ruffle,</L>
<L>The pig was lo&s;t amid the &s;cuffle.</L>
<L>"Give, give me which you plea&s;e!" he cried:</L>
<L>"Nay, pick and chu&s;e." &s;till Hodge replied.</L>
<L>"Chu&s;e! hone&s;t friend; alas! but how?</L>
<L>Heav'n &s;hield me from your murd'ring &s;ow.</L>
<L>When tythes invite, in &s;pite of foes,</L>

<L>But who that dreadful &s;tye would enter?</L>
<L>Yet, while there's hope the prize to win,</L>
<L>By Heav'n! to leave it were a &s;in."</L>
<L>This &s;aid, he arms his brea&s;t with rage,</L>
<L>And half re&s;olves the foe t'engage.</L>
<L>Spite of the par&s;on's angry mood,</L>
<L>The fearle&s;s &s;ow collected &s;tood;</L>

</LG>
<LG>

<L>"Ye &s;wains, &s;upport your injur'd prie&s;t;</L>
<L>Secure the pig, and &s;hare the fea&s;t."</L>
<L>Staunch to his friend, was ev'ry &s;wain;</L>
<L>Strange tho' it &s;eem, the bribe was vain:</L>

<P>The re&s;idence of the&s;e re&s;pectable citizens is &s;ituated near the Monument; part of which &s;tately column, as well as the fir&s;t lines of the In&s;cription, is &s;ufficiently vi&s;ible. The point of time, is the morning after the happy nuptials, while the newly married pair are at breakfa&s;t. The cavalcade of drummers, butchers with marrow-bones and cleavers, the man with the ba&s;s-viol, &amp;c. form the then u&s;ual concert on &s;uch occa&s;ions, and which is not remarkably figurative of the harmony that ought to follow the ceremony it pretends to celebrate. The wretched cripple in the corner, who is adding to the Hymeneal mu&s;ick, by vociferating the ballad of Je&s;&s;e, or the Happy Pair, repre&s;ents a well known beggar, of that period, commonly called Philip in the Tub; and who, within the memory of &s;ome per|&s;ons &s;till living, is recollected to have been a u&s;ual attendant at

<P>PERCEIVING you particularly de&s;irous to know how I pa&s;s my time in Pembroke&s;hire, I here pre&s;ent you with particulars of my proceedings in a progre&s;s I lately made to a gentleman's hou&s;e, purely to procure a plan of it.</P>
<P>I proceeded in a party of plea&s;ure with Mr. Pratt of Pickton Ca&s;tle, Mr. Powell of Penally, and Pugh of Purley, to go and dine with Mr. Pritchard of Po&s;tmain; which was readily agreed to, and &s;oon put in practice. However, I thought it a proper precaution to po&s;t away a per&s;on privately to Mr. Pritchard's, that he might provide for us; and we proceeded after him. The town where Mr. Pritchard lives is a poor, pitiful, paltry place, though his hou&s;e is in the prettie&s;t part of it, and is a prince's palace to the re&s;t. His parlour is of a lofty pitch, and full of pictures of the prime pencils; he hath a pomp|ous portico, or pavilion, prettily paved, leading to the parterre; from whence you have a prodigious pro&s;pect, particularly point|ing towards Percilly Hill, where he propagates a parcel of Por|tugue&s;e
<PB N="123" REF="140">and Poli&s;h poultry. The name of his hou&s;e is Praw|fenden, which puzzled me mo&s;t plaguily to pronounce proper|ly. He received us very politely, and pre&s;ented us with a plen|tiful dinner. At the upper-end of the table was a pike, with fried perch and plai&s;e; at the lower end pickled pork, pea&s;e, and par&s;nips; in the middle a pigeon-pye, with puff-pa&s;te; on the one &s;ide a potatoe-pudding; and on the other &s;ide pigs petty|toes. The &s;econd cour&s;e was a di&s;h of phea&s;ants, with poults and plovers, and a plate of pre&s;erved pine and pippins; another with pickled podd pepper; another with prawns; another with pargamon for a provocative; with a-pyramid pears, peaches, plums, pippins, philberts, and pi&s;lachi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. After din|ner, there was a profu&s;ion of port and punch, which proved too powerful for poor Mr. Peters, the par&s;on of the pari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; for it plea&s;ed his palate, and he poured it down by pints, which made him prate in a pedantick and pragmatical manner. This di&s;plea&s;ed Mr. Price the parliament-man, a profound politician; but he per&s;i&s;ted, and made it a prolix preamble, which proved his principles prejudiced and pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tial again&s;t the pre&s;ent people in power. Mr. Price, who is a potent party-man, called him a Popi&s;h par&s;on; and &s;aid, he prayed privately in his heart for the Pretender; and that he was a pre&s;umptuous prie&s;t, for preaching &s;uch &s;tuff publickly. The par&s;on puffed his pipe pa&s;&s;ively for &s;ome time, becau&s;e Mr. Price was his patron; but, at length, lo&s;ing all patience, he plucked off Mr. Price's perriwig, and was preparing to pu&s;h it with the point of the poker into the fire; upon which Mr. Price, perceiving a pew|ter pi&s;s-pot in the pa&s;&s;age, pre&s;ented the par&s;on with the con|tents in his phizz, and gave him a pat on the pate, the percu&s;|&s;ion of which pro&s;trated him plump on the pavement, and rai&s;ed a protuberance on his pericranium. This put a period to our proceedings, and patched up a peace; for the par&s;on was in a piteous plight, and had prudence enough to be pre|vailed upon to cry&mdash; <HI>"Peccavi!"</HI> with a&mdash; <HI>"Parce, precor!"</HI> and in a plaintive po&s;ture to petition for pardon. Mr. Price, who was proud of his performance, pulled him out of the puddle, and prote&s;ted he was prodigiou&s;ly &s;orry for what had pa&s;&s;ed in his pa&s;&s;ion, which partly proceeded from the provocation, pro|duced by &s;ome of his prepo&s;terous propo&s;itions, which he prayed him never to pre&s;ume to advance again in his pre&s;ence. Mr. Pugh, who practi&s;ed phy&s;ick, pre&s;cribed phlebotomy and a poultice to the par&s;on, but he preferred wetted brown-paper to any plai&s;ter; and then placed him&s;elf in a proper po&s;ition, that the power of the fire might penetrate his po&s;teriors, and dry his purple plu&s;h-breeches. This pother was &s;ucceeded by poli|ticks; as Mr. Pulteney, the patriot's patent for the peerage,
<PB N="124" REF="141">the Kings of Poland and Pru&s;&s;ia, Prague, the Palatines, Pan|dours, and par izans, Port&s;mouth pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ades, and the pre&s;umption of the privateers picking up prizes in our very ports, with places and pen&s;ions, pains and penalties. Next came on plays and poetry, the picture of Mr. Pope petched on a pro&s;ti|&s;tute, the price of the play-hou&s;es, the pit, pantomimes, prudes, the pox, the primate of Ireland, printers, paupers, pre|ferments, pick-pockets, pen&s;ioners, pointers, puppies, and the pranks of that prig the poet lauret's progeny, though his papa is the perfect pattern of paternal piety. To be brief, I prophe&s;y you perceive I am prolix. We parted at la&s;t, but had great difficulty to procure a pa&s;&s;age from Mr. Pritcuard: for he had placed a padlock on the &s;table-door on purpo&s;e to prevent us, and pretended his &s;ervant was gone out with the key; but, find|ing us peremptory, the key was produced, and we were per|mitted to go. We pricked our palfreys a good pace, although it was as dark as pitch; which put me in pain, becau&s;e I was purblind, le&s;t we &s;hould ride plumb again&s;t the po&s;ts, which are prefixed to keep hor&s;e-pa&s;&s;engers from going the path that is pitched with pebbles.</P>
<P>Mr. Price, who was our pilot, had a very providential e&s;cape, for his pad fell a prancing, and would no pa&s;s one &s;tep farther; which provoked him much, for he piques him&s;elf on his hor&s;e|man&s;hip. I propo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to him to di&s;mount, which he did; and, peeping and peering about, found he was upon the point of a perpendicular precipice, from which he might probably have pitched pate forward, had not his ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e plunged in that parti|cular manner. This put us all into a palpitation, and we plod|ded on the re&s;t of the progre&s;&s;ion, <HI>pian piano,</HI> as the Italians &s;ay, or <HI>pazz &agrave; pazz,</HI> as the French phra&s;e has it. I &s;hall po&s;tpone other particulars, till I have the plea&s;ure of pa&s;&s;ing a day with you at Putney, which &s;hall be as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. I am, Sir, your mo&s;t humble Servant,</P>

<HEAD>SCHEME FOR A WHISTLING ACADEMY.</HEAD>
<P>WE have often compa&s;&s;ionated the great unea&s;ine&s;s num|bers of young gentlemen at this day labour under, for want of knowing how to &s;pend their time; which &s;eems to hang heavy on their hands, being de&s;titute of a proper employ|ment. To &s;ee &s;o many di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mortals &s;auntering about from coffee-hou&s;e to coffee-hou&s;e, or from ale-hou&s;e to ale|hou&s;e, tiring them&s;elves, and tho&s;e about them, mu&s;t certainly
<PB N="125" REF="142">afford a melancholy pro&s;pect to every good natured man living. Read, they cannot; to think, is a ta&s;k more difficult. Unable, therefore, to be one moment alone, they run into any &s;ort of company that fir&s;t occurs; talking, without &s;en&s;e; laughing, without wit; and by this means become the ridicule of all their acquaintance. In this wretched &s;tate, de&s;pi&s;ed by men, and made the laughing-&s;tock of women, they have recour&s;e to the bottle. With this they regale; and in a &s;hort time be|come the mo&s;t whim&s;ical, impertinen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and rattle-headed, fel|lows in the world.</P>
<P>If this &s;pecies of mortals did not think them&s;elves too wi&s;e, and too happy, to &s;tand in need of advice, or to wi&s;h a change in their condition, it would certainly be worth while to con|&s;ider, if &s;ome ea&s;y accompli&s;hment, &s;uited to their capacities, might not be found out; the learning and practice of which might &s;erve to render them &s;upportable to them&s;elves, and not altogether in&s;upportable to tho&s;e who are &s;o unhappy as to fall into their bad company.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer both the&s;e good purpo&s;es, I can think of nothing &s;o likely as their learning to <HI>whi&s;tle.</HI> It is an attainment per|fectly &s;uited to their genius; equal to their abilities; and, in all likelihood, &s;uperior to any of their accompli&s;hments. I would, therefore, teach the&s;e untutored gentlemen to apply them&s;elves in&s;tantly to the making at lea&s;t one acqui&s;ition, that may rai&s;e them to a level with &s;omething in the animal creation. If they could but <HI>whi&s;tle</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll, they might be able to conver&s;e with the blackbird and thru&s;h, almo&s;t on an equality: an advantage they &s;eldom enjoy in human conver&s;ation; unle&s;s a pro&s;titute, a hor&s;e, or the cut of a coat, &amp;c. happen to be the &s;ubject. Be&s;ides their endeavouring to attain an accompli&s;hent, that may &s;erve as an innocent amu&s;ement, in the mid&s;t of a world where &s;o many pernicious ones abound, will be an in&s;tance of their &s;ingular virtue, and &s;upply the want of thought, which want they &s;eem to labour under, in the mo&s;t ea&s;y or natural way.</P>
<P>How happy had it been for young Hazard, if in&s;tead of at|tempting what he is by no means equal to, namely, the art of gaming, he had applied him&s;elf to the attainment of this amu&s;ing &s;cience! He might then, with a merry heart, have been <HI>whi&s;tling</HI> for his diver&s;ion; whereas now, he may, in bitter|ne&s;s of &s;oul, go <HI>whi&s;tle</HI> for his e&s;tate!</P>
<P>If &s;ome of tho&s;e creatures, al&s;o, who call them&s;elves poets, were wi&s;e enough to apply their talents to <HI>whi&s;tling,</HI> they might fairly pretend to &s;ome &s;ort of harmony; but now they are not only de&s;titute of that, but of every thing el&s;e that might atone for the want of it.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="143">The de&s;cription of Cymon, in that beautiful tale of Mr. Dryden, has ever been e&s;teemed a natural and agreeable pic|ture. There is &s;omething in him &s;o unde&s;igning, that one is a&s;|&s;ured he mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an hone&s;t heart; and cannot help conceiving an affection for him, merely in &s;eeing him walk, and hearing him <HI>whi&s;tle</HI>&mdash;
<Q><L>"He trudg'd along, unknowing what he &s;ought;</L>
<L>And <HI>whi&s;tled</HI> as he went, for want of thought."</L></Q></P>
<P>How harmle&s;s is his employment! how inoffen&s;ive his be|haviour! Now, I &s;hould be heartily glad to &s;ee any of our &s;auntering fellows make &s;o unexceptionable a figure as this ho|ne&s;t clown. But the&s;e gentlemen's want of thought generally leads them into a thou&s;and impertinences; and, in&s;tead of learning to <HI>whi&s;tle,</HI> they are frequently making ridiculous pre|ten&s;ions to ta&s;te, learning, or politicks: and there is not a coffee|hou&s;e in London but will furni&s;h us with melancholy in&s;tances of this &s;trange mi&s;application of talents.</P>
<P>To prevent &s;uch fatal mi&s;takes for the future, I humbly pro|po&s;e that a WHISTLING ACADEMY be founded, for the u&s;e of &s;uch gentry, &amp;c. whether young or old, as &s;hall be judged pro|perly qualified to be admitted members of this new mu&s;ical &s;o|ciety; contributions for which will no doubt be chearfully and liberally made by the innumerable per&s;ons of re&s;pectability who are at pre&s;ent continually pe&s;tered by the impertinence of &s;uch coxcombs.</P>

<HEAD>HEREDITARY DISEASE OF A MENDICANT.</HEAD>
<P>DINING lately with a convivial party, a few miles from town, the following adventure happened.</P>
<P>The cloth being removed, and the gla&s;s beginning to circu|late, a man very &s;lovenly as well as raggedly dre&s;&s;ed, introduced him&s;elf cap in hand to the company. Surprized at the con|duct of our ho&s;t, in permitting &s;uch a per&s;on to intrude him&s;elf, we were about to call in the landlord for an explanation; when the man undertook to apologize for him&s;elf, and excul|pate.
<PB N="128" REF="145">the people of the hou&s;e, who he declared had not &s;een him enter.</P>
<P>The &s;ingular impudence of the fellow, added to the peculiar &s;tile of his addre&s;s, &s;o &s;uperior to that of the vulgar, excited our curio&s;ity; and we were anxious to be informed of the motives that could induce a per&s;on of his athletick form, and youthful appearance, to &s;ubmit to the humiliating and precarious pro|fe&s;&s;ion of a common beggar.</P>
<P>"An hereditary di&s;order, gentlemen," replied he, "which has brought &s;everal of our family to their graves, even before they arrived at my age.

<HEAD>INFALLIBLE PRESERVATIVE AGAINST DUELLING.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. HARRISON.</BYLINE>
<P>THE practice of duelling has of late become &s;o frequent, that mo&s;t per&s;ons who have any brains to lo&s;e, think it not at all unlikely, if they mix much in what is called polite

<P>A few years ago, when duelling was much le&s;s fa&s;hionable than at pre&s;ent, I happened to be at a coffee-hou&s;e, where two young fellows, both en&s;igns in the army, &s;at di&s;cour&s;ing of their preced|ing night's pretended amours, in a &s;tile of &s;uch gro&s;&s;ne&s;s, and in tones of &s;uch vociferation, that the company in general was greatly &s;candalized; and a very decent young woman, in par|ticular, who officiated in the bar, and for who&s;e ear it was evi|dent their loo&s;e conver&s;ation was peculiarly intended, blu&s;hed &s;o immoderately, and was &s;o greatly confu&s;ed, that her &s;ituation pained me more than I can ea&s;ily de&s;cribe. I waited a &s;hort time, in expectation that &s;ome man of &s;pirit would interfere, for I am my&s;elf naturally aver&s;e to quarrelling; but, to my &s;urprize, though I could perceive the eye, of the whole room were occa&s;ion|ally on the two &s;triplings, and mo&s;t of them with looks of di&s;|gu&s;t, when either of the obnoxious parties looked round for ap|plau&s;e, which they very often &s;eemed to do, many of the company were mean enough to a&s;&s;ume a &s;ort of grin of approcation, and the re&s;t, to a man, ha&s;tily turned away their heads. This uni|ver&s;al cowardice arouzed me. I felt my&s;elf bold, and a glow of con&s;cious &s;uperiority animated my cheek. I ro&s;e from my &s;eat, and took my &s;tation at the fire; facing about to the youths who &s;at oppo&s;ite, and eyeing them with contempt. The in|crea&s;ed &s;ternne&s;s of my vi&s;age &s;oon attracted their attention; it had, probably, not plea&s;ed them before: and one of them, after whi&s;pering the other, had the audacity to addre&s;s me with &mdash;"Sir, I &s;hall look as &s;ulky as you do, if you continue to &s;tand before the fire."&mdash;"Sir," replied I, "you are an imper|tinent &s;coundrel! and, having gro&s;sly infulted the whole room
<PB N="130" REF="147">with impunity, you are, I &s;uppo&s;e, beginning to offend every one individually."</P>
<P>In an in&s;tant the heroes were both on their legs; and a &s;cene of confu&s;ion and altercation enfued, ea&s;y to conceive, but impo&s;&s;ible to be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was in&s;i&s;ted by the companion of him who had affronted me, that I &s;hould &s;ubmit to a&s;k pardon of the gentleman whom I had denominated a &s;coundrel, or meet him the next day in Hyde Park. He appealed, with great vehemence, to the com|pany, if the word &s;coundrel was proper to be u&s;ed by a gentle|man, or if any man of honour could tamely put up with the application of it to him&s;elf. The extorted an&s;wer was almo&s;t univer&s;ally&mdash;"Certainly not!" And it &s;eemed the general opinion that the difference could only be accommodated in one of the ways propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Elated with his &s;ucce&s;s, he turned to me with great &s;erocity, and demanded to know whether I cho&s;e to make the nece&s;&s;ary conce&s;&s;ions, or to meet his friend in the field.</P>
<P>"I alike de&s;pi&s;e," ha&s;tily returned I, "your friend, and your&s;elf: and &s;o far am I from acceding to your propo&s;als, or being convinced that I have be&s;towed an improper appellation on your infamous companion, that I repeat, he is a ba&s;e &s;coun|drel, and that you are as &s;habby a ra&s;cal as him&s;elf!"</P>
<P>His &s;word was now out in a moment: and, though I was unarmed, the da&s;tardly villain actually made a lunge at me; &s;wearing bitterly that he would run me through the body, if I did not immediately entreat his forgivene&s;s. But I &s;natched, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, the poker from the fire, and with a &s;ingle &s;troke &s;hivered his &s;word: at the &s;ame moment driving him to the wall, by thru&s;ting the red-hot weapon clo&s;e to his face, which appeared evidently pale with fear, notwith&s;tanding the rubicund reflection of the poker. In the mean time, his com|panion was not idle: but, having likewi&s;e drawn, he was ad|vancing to &s;alute me <HI>&agrave; po&s;teriori;</HI> when the company, per|ceiving I was more likely to quiet the young &s;parks than they had at fir&s;t dared to hope, very manfully interpo&s;ed, and pre|vented the attack in my rear.</P>
<P>Having obliged the young gentleman to a&s;k my pardon, in|&s;tend of my a&s;king his, under pain of a more intimate acquain|tance with the &s;till red poker, I turned to the other, who had by this time been compelled to deliver up his weapon, and ex|acted from him a &s;imilar apology. He, however, continued ob&s;tinately to refu&s;e, though every body was now clamorous again&s;t him, till a &s;light application of the poker to his chin convinced him that I was not to be trifled with, and he al&s;o acknowledged the impropriety of his behaviour.</P>
<P>As I was di&s;gu&s;ted with the profu&s;ion of compliments which
<PB N="131" REF="148">were now be&s;towed on my &s;pirited conduct by the company, I &s;oon quitted the room: and was the next day informed, by a friend, who happened to &s;tep in a &s;hort time after my depar|eure, that the di&s;comfited champions, and all the company, joined very cordially together in cen&s;uring the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of my behaviour, particularly my total di&s;regard to good manners in the choice of my expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Thus ended a bu&s;ine&s;s, which &s;eemed to threaten &s;omething more &s;erious; for though the young gentlemen prote&s;ted ve|hemently that they would have their revenge whenever they &s;hould meet with me, they took great care to avoid vi&s;iting every place where it was likely I might be found. Yet the&s;e youths were &s;aid to have actually &s;een &s;ervice, and to have each killed his man; certain it is, that they had for a long time over-awed the company which u&s;ually frequented the coffee-hou&s;e where I accidentally encountered them, and had totally driven away no incon&s;iderable number of cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P>It would fill a volume of no contemptible &s;ize, to recount minutely the various &s;kirmi&s;hes in which I have at different times been engaged; and yet, if I know my&s;elf, I am as much di&s;po&s;ed to treat every one with civility, and as &s;tudious in avoiding all occa&s;ions of offence, as any per&s;on living.</P>
<P>Indeed, I am not unwilling to believe that I am con&s;titu|tionally what the world calls a coward: for I really have never been able to di&s;cover in my&s;elf the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation which &s;ome men of &s;pirit &s;eem to feel in taking a waiter by the no&s;e or ears, or kicking a footman's po&s;terios, for accidentally treading on my toes, running again&s;t me on entering or quit|ting a room, when I have chanced to &s;tand in their way, or any &s;imilar offence. I may, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, have been prompted to u&s;e very intemperate language; but I have u&s;ually been afterwards weak enough to think, that my re&s;entment was even then more than adequate to the crime.</P>
<P>But, it will be &s;aid&mdash;"What has this to do with duelling? There is no danger, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, of being challenged by a waiter or footman!" I am afraid, however, that the &s;ame ira&s;cible &s;pirit which leads a gentleman to delight in tweaking the no&s;e of the former, or kicking the breech of the latter, will &s;ometimes make him &s;o far forget him&s;elf as to take a "wrong pig by the ear."</P>
<P>The inference is plain: A man of &s;pirit&mdash;that is, one who has long enjoyed the &s;upreme felicity of &s;eeing every one ap|proach him with fear and trembling&mdash;&s;uddenly finding a &s;trong oppo&s;ition to his high behe&s;ts, ventures to try the force of per|&s;onal threats: he challenges his antagoni&s;t; and, borne up by that enthu&s;ia&s;m which is always denominated courage, though it &s;hould &s;ometimes have a very different appellation, he goes
<PB N="132" REF="149">to the field, where he pronably leaves an exi&s;tence which has too long been offen&s;ive to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>So far duelling may be &s;aid to be rather &s;erviceable than pre|judicial to mankind; and, if it always happened that the ag|gre&s;&s;or was not the &s;urvivor, the practice would be much le&s;s liable to objection. But for this material property, I believe, it's warme&s;t advocates have not attempted to contend.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, however, avoid entering into the rationality of the cu&s;tom; of that, every one who has common under&s;tanding is perhaps full as able to judge as my&s;elf, and any arguments would be thrown away on per&s;ons of inferior capacity.</P>
<P>I have already given &s;ome rea&s;ons for the &s;u&s;picion I have ever entertained, that I am my&s;elf naturally a coward: I really never enjoyed per&s;onal conte&s;ts; for though, when a lad, I had now and then manual &s;truggles for &s;upetiority, and was always for|tunate enough to prove the victor, I never engaged but with reluctance.</P>
<P>This antipathy, however, to deci&s;ions by combat, has never prevented me from giving my &s;entiments freely on any &s;ubject, in whatever company I have fallen; and, though I am not wholly unacquainted with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he art of verbal retreat, it is perhaps the only &s;pecies of defence I have ever been afraid of adopt|ing.</P>
<P>That I have, from the various di&s;putations in which I have been engaged, received at lea&s;t twenty challenges, and more than twice as many menaces, will not be greatly wondered at by tho&s;e who know life, when I inform them, that I have now and then &s;at for a whole hour together with young &s;unaltern offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, both of the army and navy; game&s;ters of all the diffe|rent &s;pecies; fortune-hunters; men of gallantry; great wits; led captains; and politicians. Indeed, I doubt not, that many young men of the town, who a&s;&s;ociate con&s;tantly with &s;uch companions, have at half my age had at lea&s;t double the num|ber.</P>
<P>In extricating my&s;elf from the&s;e difficulties, I have never once had occa&s;ion to apply for redre&s;s to the laws of my coun|try; though, as they certainly are as well calculated to pre|&s;erve the weak, the infirm, the aged, and the meek, from the per&s;onal in&s;ults of the &s;touter, the younger, and more turbulent, as human &s;agacity can po&s;&s;ibly contrive, I &s;hould by no means have felt my&s;elf degraded by appealing to tho&s;e in&s;titutions, which were planned by our progenitors when national bravery was not at it's lowe&s;t ebb, with much le&s;s folly and ab&s;urdity than &s;eems to be generally imagined by their abundantly wi&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, had no quicker and equally efficacious remedies pre|&s;ented them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="150">I have con&s;tantly found, that the mo&s;t boi&s;terous heroes have been &s;oon tranquilized, when they were once thoroughly convinced that a man would not <HI>fight fair:</HI> for though, after po&s;itively refu&s;ing a challenge. I have been often violently threatened with per&s;onal cha&s;ti&s;ement, on my giving the parties to under&s;tand that I was not very delicate in my choice of weapons, their menaces, which I always treated with the mo&s;t re&s;olute defiance, were &s;eldom attempted to be put in execu|tion. Once, indeed, a young Hibernian rai&s;ed his cane, which was intended to &s;alute my head or &s;houlders; but, on my &s;eiz|ing a candle&s;tick which &s;tood before me, he thought proper to defer the di&s;charge of his anger, till he met with one who was le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to make him a &s;uitable return.</P>
<P>If this method be invariably pur&s;ued, with becoming re&s;olu|tion, it will, I apprehend, prove to others, as it has long done to me, an infallible pre&s;ervative again&s;t duelling.</P>

<HEAD>IN A LETTER FROM FARMER TRUEMAN'S TOWZER, TO SQUIRE HEAVISIDE'S PONTO.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR PONTO,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Went home with Philis, the par&s;on's &s;peckled bitch, la&s;t Tue&s;day; and, to my great amazement, I heard the doc|tor declare, that there is actually a &s;cheme on foot to tax us poor dogs; the con&s;equence of which will be, that three parts in four of our &s;pecies will be knocked on the head. I profe&s;s I am not in any dread for my&s;elf, nor for you, my dear Ponto; for our u&s;efulne&s;s will pre&s;erve us, &s;ince men, though they are by far the mo&s;t ungrateful of all other ani|mals, &s;eldom chu&s;e to de&s;troy what is of real benefit to them|&s;elves. I am not, therefore, alarmed out of any &s;elfi&s;h view: no, it is a noble &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m that inflames me; and, though I &s;ay it, there is not a dog in the nation that will fight more de&s;perately, or bark louder, in a good cau&s;e, than your old friend Towzer. Let your &s;neaking puppies follow low mercenary views; let them wag their tails at every &s;coundrel, and nuzzle in dunghills for hall a bone; I am a Briti&s;h ma&s;tiff, and &s;corn &s;uch paltry actions. I will venture to &s;ay, that almighty Love it&s;elf cannot make me do a little thing; and though I like a pretty bitch as well as another dog, yet it is not in the power of the mo&s;t charming of that bewitching &s;ex, either by day to make me kill a neighbour's &s;heep, or by night to de&s;ert my po&s;t, and leave my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e unguarded.
<PB N="134" REF="151">"But why all the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions of hone&s;ty to me," my Ponto will &s;ay, "who have had long experience of Towzer's worth and imtegrity?" True; but at this conjuncture it is highly requi&s;ite thou &s;houlde&s;t think the be&s;t of me, &s;ince I am about to engage thee in an affair, the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and importance of which cannot be too &s;trictly at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ended to; and the greater opinion thou ha&s;t of the propo&s;er, with the more alacrity wilt thou enter on the affair.</P>
<P>One mu&s;t be a &s;tupid dog indeed, not to know that, not|with&s;tanding our almo&s;t innumerable taxes, the mini&s;try want money damnably. Therefore this act will certainly take place, unle&s;s we can &s;tart &s;ome other &s;cheme, from which more cole may be expected.

<P>Thy intimacy with Mi&s;s Biddy's lap-dog will forward thee in the way that I &s;hall chalk out to thee. Thou mu&s;t engage Shock to communicate my propo&s;als to his fair mi&s;tre&s;s, and at the &s;ame time back them with his intere&s;t; and if &s;he &s;tands our friend, we have nothing to fear; for Sir Nathan Nimbletongue, the member for the county, is her &s;lave; and &s;he has a pair of eyes that would dazzle a Roman &s;enate into blindne&s;s to the common cau&s;e, and corrupt the integrity of a Cato.

<P N="1">1. The family of the Sad Dogs has ever been reckoned, without controver&s;y, the mo&s;t ancient and mo&s;t numerous of any in the kingdom; if, therefore, they were taxed at the ea&s;y rate of one &s;hilling per head, they would bring in to the government annually at lea&s;t four hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lazy Dogs are tho&s;e expletives of Nature, which &s;eem only formed to devour her works, and prevent her from being burden&s;ome to her&s;elf with her own exuberancy; and would, at &s;ixpence a head, produce the &s;ame &s;um at lea&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>THE KING'S COUSIN AND COUNSELLOR. AN ANECDOTE OF GEORGE II. AND THE EARL OF CHES|TERFIELD.</HEAD>
<P>SOON after the late Earl of Che&s;terfield was made a mem|ber of the Cabinet, a place of great tru&s;t became vacant, to which the Earl and the Duke of Dor&s;et recommended two very different per&s;ons. His Maje&s;ty contended for his own recommendation with much warmth; and, finding he was not likely to &s;ucceed, he left the council-chamber in great anger, prote&s;ting that he would be obeyed. The king being retired, a violent conte&s;t en&s;ued; but at length it was carried again&s;t him, le&s;t he &s;hould expect the &s;ame implicit obedience on other occa&s;ions, when it might ri&s;e into a dangerous pre|cedent. The difficulty now was, who &s;hould wait on the king, in his pre&s;ent humour, with the grant of the office for his &s;ignature; a ta&s;k which fell to the lot of Lord Che&s;ter|field. As his Lord&s;hip expected to find the king very little di&s;po&s;ed to execute the bu&s;ine&s;s, he prudently took care not to incen&s;e him by abruptly making the reque&s;t; but a&s;ked, in accents of great humility, with who&s;e name his Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to have the blanks filled up. "With the Devil's!" an&s;wered the king, with all the vehemence of pa&s;&s;ion. "And will your Maje&s;ty," coolly replied the Earl, "permit the in|&s;trument to run, as u&s;ual&mdash;<HI>"Our tru&s;ty and well-beloved Cou&s;in and Coun&s;ellor?"</HI> The King, laughing very heartily, immediately put his hand to the appointment, and related to every body the &s;ucce&s;s with which the noble Earl's wit had attacked his ill-humour.</P>

<L>Her temper neither new nor &s;trange,</L>

<L>She had a va&s;t contempt for &s;pou&s;e;</L>

<P>WHILE the preceding print repre&s;ents the good youth rewarded by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a virtuous woman, in the pre&s;ent appears the &s;ad contra&s;t of his profligate fellow-apprentice a&s;&s;ociated with one of tho&s;e wretched outca&s;ts of &s;ociety, who di&s;grace not only their &s;ex, but human nature. With this loath&s;ome being, the tenant of a mi&s;erable garret, he is now &s;een in bed. He may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have de&s;erted from the &s;ea-&s;ervice, in con&s;equence of the &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement to which his idlene&s;s, his vices, and perhaps his cowardice&mdash;for the mo&s;t profligate are by no means the mo&s;t brave&mdash;have there continually &s;ubjected him. The mode of life which he has &s;ub&s;equently pur&s;ued, is &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated by the pi&s;tols and other implements of the robber's trade; as well as by the watches and trinkets which form his booty, or rather that of the artful pro&s;titute with whom he has formed the illicit connection. This wretch, who&s;e filthy and di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate is implied by the gallipot and phials on the mantle-piece, &s;urveys with compo&s;ure a rich ear-ring, part of the precious &s;poil; while her paramour, con&s;cious of the guilt by which it was obtained, and in momentary dread of pur&s;uing ju&s;tice, &s;tarts up, petrified with horror, on the falling of &s;ome loo&s;e bricks down the crazy chimney, over which a cat was pa&s;&s;ing,

His joys are not her joys, nor his griefs her griefs!</P>
<P>Though this print is by no means crouded with objects, every tittle it contains is de&s;criptive of the wretchedne&s;s, and di&s;order attendant on vicious life. The precaution of continual apprehen&s;ion, has occa&s;ioned them to barricade the door with planks &s;loping from the floor; the &s;hattered pla&s;ter demon&s;trates the wretchedne&s;s of the place; the broken-down bed&s;tead is not without meaning; the hoop, hung over the bed's-head, &s;arca&s;tically conveys to the imagination what filthy beings may be occa&s;ionally covered with a fa&s;hionable article of dre&s;s; and the dram-bottle with a broken gla&s;s, the jug and pipe both likewi&s;e broken, and the fractured ba&s;on on the mantle-&s;helf, all a&s;&s;i&s;t to di&s;play the con&s;equences of indolence and ebriety.

<HEAD>THE MODERN MAN OF HONOUR.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who attack the fundamental laws of virtue and morality, urge the uncertainty of them, and alledge their variations in different countries, and even in different ages in the &s;ame countries. "Morality," &s;ay they, "is local, and con&s;equently an imaginary thing; &s;ince what is rejected in one climate as a vice, is practi&s;ed in another as a virtue." And, according to them, the voice of nature &s;peaks as many different languages as there are nations in the world.</P>
<P>The dangers and ill con&s;equences of this doctrine are ob|vious; but, &s;urely, the fal&s;ity of it is not le&s;s &s;o: and the mo&s;t charitable opinion one can entertain of tho&s;e who propagate it is, that they mi&s;take fa&s;hion and cu&s;tom for nature and rea&s;on. The invariable laws of ju&s;tice and morality are the fir&s;t and univer&s;al emanations of human rea&s;on, while unprejudiced and uncorrupted; and we may as well &s;ay that &s;ickne&s;s is the na|tural &s;tate of the body, as that inju&s;tice and immorality are the natural &s;ituation of the mind. We contract mo&s;t of the di&s;|tempers of the one by the irregularity of our appetites, and of the other by yielding to the impetuo&s;ity of our pa&s;&s;ions; but, in both ca&s;es, rea&s;on, when con&s;ulted, &s;peaks a different lan|guage.</P>
<P>I admit, that the prevailing cu&s;toms and fa&s;hions of mo&s;t countries are not founded on rea&s;on; and, on the contrary, are too frequently repugnant to it: but then the rea&s;onable people of tho&s;e countries contemn and abhor them, though it may be they too wittingly comply with, or at lea&s;t have not courage openly enough to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>The people of rank and di&s;tinction, in every country, are properly called the people of fa&s;hion; becau&s;e, in truth, they &s;ettle the fa&s;hion. In&s;tead of &s;ubjecting them&s;elves to the laws, they take mea&s;ure of their own appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, and then make laws to fit them; which laws, though neither &s;ounded in ju&s;tice, nor enacted by a legal authority, too often prevail over and in&s;ult both ju&s;tice and authority. This is fa&s;hion!</P>
<P>In this light I have often con&s;idered the word Honour in it's fa&s;hionable acceptation in this country; and mu&s;t confe&s;s, that, were that the univer&s;al meaning of it throughout this kingdom, it would very much confirm the doctrine I endea|vour to confute; and would be &s;o contrary to that honour which rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, and common-&s;en&s;e, point out, that I &s;hould not wonder if it inclined people to call in que&s;tion the very exi&s;tence of honour it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The character of a Man of Honour, as received in the <HI>beau monde,</HI> is &s;omething &s;o very &s;ingular, that it de&s;erves a particu|lar
<PB N="148" REF="168">examination; and, though ea&s;ier ob&s;erved than de&s;cribed, I &s;hall endeavour to give my readers a de&s;cription of it, illu&s;|trated with &s;ome original pieces, which have luckily fallen into my hands.</P>
<P>A Man of Honour is one who peremptorily affirms him&s;elf to be &s;o; and who will cut any body's throat that que&s;tions it, though on the be&s;t grounds: he is infinitely above the re&s;traints which the laws of God or man lay on vulgar minds, and knows no other ties than tho&s;e of Honour; of which word he is to be the &s;ole expounder. He mu&s;t &s;trictly adhere to a party denomination, though he may be utterly regardle&s;s of it's principles. His expence &s;hould exceed his income con&s;ide|rably; not for the nece&s;&s;aries, but for the &s;uperfluities of life; that the debts he contracts may do him Honour. There &s;hould be a haughtine&s;s and in&s;olence in his deportment, which is &s;up|po&s;ed to re&s;ult from con&s;cious Honour. If he be cholerick, and wrong-headed into the bargain, with a good deal of animal courage, he acquires the glorious character of a man of nice and jealous Honour: and, if all the&s;e qualifications are duly &s;ea&s;oned with the genteele&s;t vices, the Man of Honour is compleat; any thing his wife, children, &s;ervants, or trade&s;men, may think to the contrary, notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Belville is allowed to be a man of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate Ho|nour that this or any other age ever produced. The men are proud of his acquaintance, and the women of his protection; his party glories in being countenanced by him, and his Ho|nour is frequently quoted as a &s;anction for their conduct. But &s;ome original letters, which I &s;hall give my readers, will let them more intimately into the particulars of &s;o &s;hining a cha|racter, than mere de&s;cription would do.</P>

<P>It appears, from the&s;e authentick pieces, that Mr. Belville, filled with the noble&s;t &s;entiments of Honour, paid all debts but his ju&s;t ones, kept his word &s;crupulou&s;ly in the flagitious &s;ale of his con&s;cience to a mini&s;ter; was ready to protect, at the expence of his friend's life, his friend's wife, whom, by the op|portunities that friend&s;hip had given him, he had corrupted: and puni&s;hed truth with death, when it intimated, however ju&s;tly, the want of it in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This per&s;on of refined Honour, con&s;cious of his own merit and virtue, is a mo&s;t unmerciful cen&s;or of the le&s;&s;er vices and failings of others; and lavi&s;hly be&s;tows the epithets of Scoun|drel and Ra&s;cal on all tho&s;e who, in a &s;ubordinate rank of life, &s;eem to a&s;pire to any genteel degree of immorality. An auk|ward country gentleman, who &s;ells his &s;ilent vote cheap, is with him a &s;ad dog. The indu&s;trious trade&s;men are a pack of cheating ra&s;cals, who &s;hould be better regulated, and not &s;uffered to impo&s;e on people of condition; and &s;ervants are a parcel of idle &s;coundrels, that ought to be u&s;ed ill, and not paid their wages, in order to check their in&s;olence.</P>
<P>It is not to be imagined how pernicious the example of &s;uch a creature is to &s;ociety: he is admired, and con&s;equently imi|tated; he not only immediately corrupts his own circle of ac|quaintance, but the contagion &s;preads it&s;elf to infinity; as circles in water produce one another, though gradually le&s;s marked out, in proportion as they are remoter from the cau&s;e of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>To &s;uch practice, and &s;uch examples in higher life, may ju&s;tly be imputed the general corruption and immorality which prevail through this kingdom; but when &s;uch is the force of fa&s;hion, and when the examples of people of the fir&s;t rank in a country are &s;o prevalent as to dignify vice and immorality, in &s;pite of all laws, divine and human, how popular might they make virtue, if they would exert their power in it's cau&s;e? And how mu&s;t they, in their cooler moments, reproach them|&s;elves, when they come to reflect that, by their fatal examples, they have beggared, corrupted, and, it may be, en&s;laved, a whole nation!</P>

<HEAD>THE PLURALIST'S DINNER; OR, THE CURATE A MATCH FOR THE DEAN.</HEAD>
<P>A Dean of Canterbury, remarkable for holding a great number of church-preferments, travelling &s;lowly in his chariot to that city, was overtaken by a poor par&s;on, who had procured the loan of a good hor&s;e. The par&s;on, <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> bowed mo&s;t re&s;pectfully to the dean; who, de&s;iring him to &s;top, begged he would call at the Mermaid at Roche&s;ter; and order him a dinner, to be ready at a certain hour. The par&s;on ac|cordingly called on the ho&s;t, and told him that he would be honoured with a vi&s;it at &s;uch a time, and mu&s;t provide a good dinner. "For how many, and plea&s;e your honour?" &s;ays Boniface.</P>
<P>"Why," replies the par&s;on, "I can't well &s;ay how many per&s;ons the whole company will con&s;i&s;t of; for I only &s;aw the Dean of Canterbury, the Canon of Winche&s;ter, the Provo&s;t of Litchfield, the Rector of Orpington, the Vicar of Romney, and one of the King's Chaplains."</P>
<P>The par&s;on then proceeded to his own home, which was within a few miles; and the landlord began to make ample provi&s;ion for the numerous gue&s;ts he expected to entertain. Accordingly, when the Dean arrived, a large table was &s;pread, and the cloth laid. "How's this!" cries his reverence; "you have &s;hewn me the wrong room!

<P>"And plea&s;ure your honour," replied the landlord, "Par|&s;on Singlechurch called about an hour and a half ago, and told me I mu&s;t provide for your honour, and the Canon of Win|che&s;ter, and the Provo&s;t of Litchfield, and the Rector of Or|pington, and one of the King's Chaplains too, and I don't know how many more; and &s;o I thought, and plea&s;e your ho|nour, I'd get enough."</P>

<HEAD>SPOILED CHILDREN. A MIRROR FOR MOTHERS.</HEAD>
<P>I Am engaged in a vi&s;it at a friend's hou&s;e in the country, where I promi&s;ed my&s;elf much &s;atisfaction. I have, how|ever, been greatly di&s;appointed in my expectations; for, on my arrival, I found a hou&s;e full of children, who are <HI>humoured</HI> beyond mea&s;ure, and indeed ab&s;olutely &s;poiled, by the ridicu|lous
<PB N="152" REF="172">indulgence of a fond mother. This unlucky circum|&s;tance has &s;ubjected me to many inconveniences; and, as I am a man of a grave re&s;erved di&s;po&s;ition, has been a perpetual &s;ource of embarra&s;&s;ment and perplexity.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day of my vi&s;it, in the mid&s;t of dinner, the elde&s;t boy, who is eight years old, whipped off my perriwig with great dexterity, and received the applau&s;e of the table for his humour and &s;pirit. This lad, when he has reached his four|teenth year, and is big enough to lie without the maid, is to be &s;ent to a &s;chool in the neighbourhood, which has no other merit than that of being but &s;even miles off. Six of the chil|dren are permitted to &s;it at table, who entirely monopolize the wings of fowls, and the mo&s;t delicate mor&s;els of every di&s;h, becau&s;e the mother has di&s;covered that her children have not <HI>&s;trong</HI> &s;tomachs.</P>
<P>In the morning, before my friend is up, I generally take a turn on the gravel-walk, where I could wi&s;h to enjoy my own thoughts without interruption; but I am here in&s;tantly at|tended by my little tormentors, who follow me backwards and forwards; and play at what they call <HI>Running after the Gentle|man.</HI> My whip, which was a pre&s;ent from an old friend, has been la&s;hed to pieces by one of the boys who is fond of hor&s;es, and the handle is turned into a hobby-hor&s;e. The main-&s;pring of my repeating-watch has been broke in the nur&s;ery; which, at the mother's reque&s;t, I had lent to the younge&s;t boy, who was ju&s;t breeched, and who cried to wear it.</P>
<P>The mother's attention to the children entirely de&s;troys all conver&s;ation: and once, as an amu&s;ement for the evenings, we attempted to begin reading <HI>Tom Jones;</HI> but were interrupted, in the &s;econd page, by little <HI>Sammy,</HI> who is &s;uffered to whip his top in the parlour. I am known to be troubled with vio|lent head-aches; notwith&s;tanding which, another of the boys, without notice given, or any regard paid to the company, is permitted to break out into the brayings of an a&s;s, for which the &s;trength of his lungs is commended; and a little mi&s;s, at breakfa&s;t, is allowed to drink up all the cream, and put her &s;ingers into the &s;ugar-di&s;h, becau&s;e &s;he was once <HI>&s;ickly.</HI> I am teazed with familiarities, which I can only repay with a frown; and pe&s;tered with the petulance of ludicrous prattle, in which I am unqualified to join. It is whi&s;pered in the family, that I am a mighty good &s;ort of a man, but that I cannot <HI>talk to children.</HI> Nor am I the only per&s;on who &s;uffers from this folly: a neighbouring clergyman, of great merit and mode&s;ty, and much acquainted in the family, has received hints to for|bear coming to the hou&s;e, becau&s;e little <HI>Sukey</HI> always cries

<P>Mrs. Qualm, my friend's wife, the mother of this hopeful offspring, is perpetually breeding; or rather her whole exi&s;tence is &s;pent in a &s;eries of great-bellies, lyings-in, vi&s;itings, church|ings, and chri&s;tenings. Every tran&s;action of her life is dated from her &s;everal pregnancies. The grandmother, and the man-midwife, a &s;erious, &s;en&s;ible man, con&s;tantly re&s;ide in the hou&s;e, to be always ready on the&s;e &s;olemn occa&s;ions. She boa&s;ts, that no family has ever &s;ent out more numerous adver|ti&s;ements for nur&s;es <HI>with a fine brea&s;t of milk.</HI> As her long|ings have of late been in the vegetable way, the garden is cultivated for this purpo&s;e alone, and totally filled with forward peas, and melon-gla&s;&s;es, in hopes that &s;he may luckily long for what is at hand. She pre&s;erves, to the utmo&s;t the preroga|tive of frequent pregnancy; and, con&s;cious of the dignity and importance of being often <HI>big,</HI> exerts an ab&s;olute authority over her hu&s;band. He was once a keen fox-hunter, but has long ago dropped his hounds; his wife having remon&s;trated, that his early ri&s;ing di&s;turbed the family un&s;ea&s;onably, and having dreamed that he broke his leg in leaping a ditch.</P>
<P>I revere Mrs. Qualm as the mother, and only wi&s;h I could recommend her as the manager, of children. I hope this letter may fall into her hands, to convince her how ab&s;urd it is to &s;uppo&s;e, that others can be as much intere&s;ted in her own children as her&s;elf. I would teach her, that what I complain of as matter of inconvenience, may one day prove to her a &s;e|vere trial; and that early licentiou&s;ne&s;s will, at la&s;t, mock that parental affection from who&s;e mi&s;taken indulgence it aro&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>HUMOROUS DESCRIPTION OF A CITIZEN AND HIS FAMILY AT VAUXHALL.</HEAD>
<P>I Was greatly diverted, la&s;t Saturday evening, at Vauxhall, with the &s;hrewd remarks of an hone&s;t citizen, who&s;e wife and two daughters had prevailed on him to carry them to the Garden. As I thought there was &s;omething curious in their behaviour, I went into the next box to them, where I had an opportunity of &s;eeing and over-hearing every thing that pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>After &s;ome talk&mdash;" Come, come," &s;aid the old don, "it is time, I think, to go to &s;upper." To this the ladies readily a&s;&s;ented; and one of the Mi&s;&s;es &s;aid&mdash;" Do let us have a chick, papa."&mdash;" Zounds!" &s;aid the father, "they are half a crown a-piece, and no bigger than a &s;parrow." Here the old lady took him up&mdash;" You are &s;o &s;tingy, Mr. Ro&s;e, there is no bear|ing you. When one is out upon plea&s;ure, I love to appear like &s;omebody: and what &s;ignifies a few &s;hillings once and away, when a body is about it?" This reproof &s;o effectually &s;ilenced the old gentleman, that the younge&s;t Mi&s;s had the courage to put in a word for &s;ome ham likewi&s;e. The waiter was called, and di&s;patched by the old lady with an order for a chicken and a plate of ham. When it was brought, our ho|ne&s;t cit twirled the di&s;h about three or four times, and &s;urveyed it with a very &s;ettled countenance; then, taking up a &s;lice of ham, and dangling it to and fro on the end of his fork, a&s;ked the waiter, how much there was of it. "A &s;hilling's worth, Sir," &s;aid the fellow.&mdash;" Pr'ythee," &s;aid the don, "how much do&s;t think it weighs?"&mdash;" An ounce."&mdash;" A &s;hilling an ounce! that is &s;ixteen &s;hillings per pound!&mdash;A rea&s;onable pro|fit, truly!&mdash;Let me &s;ee&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e, now, the whole ham weighs thirty pounds; at a &s;hilling per ounce, that is &s;ixteen &s;hillings per pound: why, your ma&s;ter makes exactly twenty-four pounds of every ham; and, if he buys them at the be&s;t hand, and &s;alts them and cures them him&s;elf, they don't &s;tand him in ten &s;hillings a-piece." The old lady bade him hold his non&s;en&s;e, declared her&s;elf a&s;hamed for him, and a&s;ked him if people mu&s;t not live: the, taking a coloured handkerchief from her own neck, &s;he tucked it into his &s;hirt-collar, "whence it hung like a bid," and helped him to a leg of the chicken. The old gen|tleman, at every bit he put into his mouth, amu&s;ed him&s;elf with &s;aying&mdash;" There goes two-pence&mdash;There goes three-pence&mdash; There goes a groat. Zounds! a man at the&s;e places &s;hould not have a &s;wallow &s;o wide as a tom-tit."</P>
<P>This &s;canty repa&s;t, we may imagine, was &s;oon di&s;patched; and it was with much difficulty our citizen was prevailed on
<PB N="155" REF="175">to &s;uffer a plate of beef to be ordered. This, too, was no le&s;s admired, and underwent the &s;ame comments with the ham. At length, when only a very &s;mall bit was left, as they &s;ay, for manners, in the di&s;h, our don took a piece of an old new&s;paper out of his pocket; and, gravely wrapping up the meat in it, placed it carefully in his letter-ca&s;e. "I'll keep thee as a curio&s;ity to my dying day; and I'll &s;hew thee to my neighbour Hor&s;eman, and a&s;k him if he can make as much of his &s;teaks." Then rubbing his hands, and &s;hrugging up his &s;houlders&mdash; "Why, now," &s;ays he, "to-morrow night I may eat as much cold beef as I can &s;tuff in any tavern in London, and pay nothing for it." A di&s;h of tarts, chee&s;e-cakes, and cu&s;tards, next made their appearance, at the reque&s;t of the young ladies, who paid no &s;ort of regard to the &s;ather's remon|&s;trance, that they were four times as dear as at the pa&s;try|cook's.</P>
<P>Supper being ended, Madam put her &s;pou&s;e in mind to call for wine. "We mu&s;t have &s;ome wine, my dear, or we &s;hall not be looked upon, you know."&mdash;"Well, well," &s;ays the don, "that's right enough. But do they &s;ell their liquor too by the ounce?&mdash;Here, drawer, what wine have you got?" The fellow, who by this time began to &s;moke his gue&s;ts, an&s;wered &mdash; "We have exceeding good French wine of all &s;orts, and plea&s;e your honour. Would your honour have a bottle of Champagne, or Burgundy, or Claret, or&mdash;?"&mdash; "No, no, none of your wi&s;hy-wa&s;hy outlandi&s;h rot-gut for me!" inter|rupted the citizen. "A tankard of the Alderman beats all the red Claret wine in the French king's cellar.&mdash;But, come, bring us a bottle of &s;ound old Port: and, d'ye hear? let it be good."</P>
<P>While the waiter was gone, the good man mo&s;t &s;adly lament|ed, that he could not have his pipe; which the wife would not allow, becau&s;e, &s;he &s;aid, it was ungenteel to &s;moke, where any ladies were in company. When the wine came, our citizen gravely took up the bottle; and, holding it above his head&mdash; "Aye, aye," &s;aid he, "the bottom has had a good kick!&mdash;And mind how confoundedly it is pinched on the &s;ides.&mdash;Not above five gills, I warrant. An old &s;oldier at the Jeru&s;alem would beat two of them. But let us &s;ee how it is brewed." He then poured out a gla&s;s; and, after holding it up before the candle, &s;melling to it, &s;ipping it twice or thrice, and &s;macking his lips, drank it off: but, declaring that &s;econd thoughts were be&s;t, he filled another bumper; and to&s;&s;ing that off, after &s;ome pau&s;e, with a very important air, ventured to pronounce it drinkable. The ladies, having al&s;o drank a gla&s;s round, affirmed it was very good, and felt warm in the &s;tomach: and even the old
<PB N="156" REF="176">gentleman relaxed into &s;uch good humour by the time the bottle was emptied, that, out of his own free will and motion, he mo&s;t generou&s;ly called for another pint, but charged the waiter to pick out an hone&s;t one.</P>
<P>While the gla&s;s was thus circulating, the family amu&s;ed them&s;elves with making ob&s;ervations on the Garden. The citizen expre&s;&s;ed his wonder at the number of lamps; and &s;aid, it mu&s;t co&s;t a great deal of money every night to light them all: the elde&s;t Mi&s;s declared that, for her part, &s;he liked the dark walk be&s;t of all, becau&s;e it was &s;olentary; little Mi&s;s thought the la&s;t &s;ong mighty pretty, and &s;aid &s;he would buy it, if &s;he could but carry home the tune: and the old lady ob|&s;erved, that there was a great deal of good company indeed; but the gentlemen were &s;o rude, that they perfectly put her out of countenance by &s;taring at her through their &s;py-gla&s;&s;es. In a word, the tarts, the chee&s;e-cakes, the beef, the chicken, the ounce of ham, and every thing, &s;eemed to have been quite for|got, till the di&s;mal moment approached, when the reckoning was called for. As this &s;olemn bu&s;ine&s;s concerns only the gen|tlemen, the ladies kept a profound &s;ilence; and, when the terri|ble account was brought, they left the payma&s;ter undi&s;turbed, to enjoy the mi&s;ery by him&s;elf: only the old lady had the har|dine&s;s to &s;quint at the &s;um-total, and declared it was pretty rea|&s;onable con&s;idering!</P>
<P>Our citizen bore his misfortunes with a tolerable degree of patience. He &s;hook his head as he run-over every article, and &s;wore he would never buy meat by the ounce again. At length, when he had carefully &s;ummed up every figure, he bade the drawer bring change for &s;ixpence: then pulling out a leathern pur&s;e from a &s;nug pocket in the in&s;ide of his wai&s;tcoat, he drew out &s;lowly, piece by piece, thirteen &s;hillings; which he regu|larly placed in two rows on the table. When the change was brought, after counting it very carefully, he laid down four half|pence in the &s;ame exact order; then calling the waiter&mdash; "There," &s;ays he, "there's your damage&mdash;thirteen and two|pence.&mdash;And, hearkye, there's three-pence over for your&s;elf." The remaining penny he put into his coat-pocket; and, chinking it&mdash;"This," &s;ays, he, "will &s;erve me to-morrow to buy a paper of tobacco."</P>
<P>The family now prepared them&s;elves for going; and, as there were &s;ome &s;light drops of rain, Madam buttoned up the old gentleman's coat, that he might not &s;poil his laced wai&s;tcoat; and made him flap his hat, over which &s;he tied his pocket-hand|kerchief, to &s;ave his wig: and as the coat it&s;elf, &s;he &s;aid, had never been worn but three Sundays, &s;he even parted with her own cardinal, and &s;pread it, the wrong &s;ide out, over his &s;houl|ders.
<PB N="157" REF="177">In the&s;e accoutrements he &s;allied forth, accompaned by his wife with her upper-petticoat thrown over her head, and his daughters with the &s;kirts of their gowns turned up, and their heads muffled up in coloured handkerchiefs. I followed them quite out of the garden: and, as they were waiting for their hack to draw up, the younge&s;t Mi&s;s a&s;ked&mdash;"When &s;hall we come again, papa?"&mdash;"Come again!" &s;aid he, "what a pox would you ruin me? Once in one's life is enough; and I think I have done very hand&s;ome. Why, it would not have co&s;t me above four-pence-halfpenny to have &s;pent my evening at Sot's Hole; and what with the cur&s;ed coach-hire, and all together, here's almo&s;t a pound gone, and nothing to &s;hew for it!"&mdash;"Fie, Mr. Ro&s;e! I'm quite a&s;hamed for you," replies the old lady. "You are always grudging me and your girls the lea&s;t bit of plea&s;ure; and you cannot help grumbling, if we do but go to Little Horn&s;ey to drink tea. I am &s;ure, now they are women grown up, they ought to &s;ee a little of the world; and they &s;hall!" The old don was not willing to pur&s;ue the argument any farther; and, the coach coming up, he was glad to put an end to the di&s;pute, by &s;aying&mdash;"Come, come, let us make ha&s;te, wife, or we &s;hall not get home time enough to have my be&s;t wig combed out again; and to-morrow, you know, is Sunday."</P>

<P>CIBBER was engaged in a paper war with Pope; and be|ing told one day that Pope intended to pro&s;ecute him for making too free with his character, Cibber happened to be in a peevi&s;h temper, and replied&mdash;"He may ki&s;s my ar&s;e!" On this, one of his friends, who were all on the banter, ob|&s;erved, that it was not language for a gentleman, and that he was &s;ure that Cibber would not dare &s;ay &s;o to Pope's face.&mdash;"By God, Sir," &s;ays Colley, "I would tell him &s;o, or any puppy that &s;hould take his part!"&mdash;This a&s;&s;ertion was what they were fi&s;hing for, as they now perceived that he was in a right cue to be worked up to any pitch. And &s;o it proved; for, before they parted, they provoked him to a bett of one hun|dred guineas, that he would bid Pope ki&s;s his ar&s;e in the pub|lick play-hou&s;e; bid the company he &s;at with ki&s;s his ar&s;e, let them be who they would; bid box, pit, and gallery, &s;eparately, ki&s;s his ar&s;e likewi&s;e; and, in conclu&s;ion, bid the whole hou&s;e ki&s;s his ar&s;e all together. This mad wager &s;oon got wind; and it was generally known that Pope was to be at the play the next night. When the time came, the hou&s;e was crouded. Now, as it was the beginning of term, the &s;olicitor and attor|ney-general
<PB N="158" REF="178">were both in the &s;tage-box, according to an an|cient cu&s;tom; and who &s;hould be perched plump between them, but Alexander the Little. Well, Colley had bought the collar, and he was re&s;olved to go through with it: &s;o ju&s;t as the la&s;t mu&s;ick was playing, and the curtain ready to be drawn up, he rang the bell, and pu&s;hed boldly on the &s;tage. Cibber bowed, the hou&s;e clapped; he bowed again: all was atten|tion; and thus he began&mdash;"Ladies and gentlemen, I have a &s;tory to tell you; to which, if you do not honour me with an in|dulgent hearing, I &s;hall lo&s;e one hundred guineas." On this a univer&s;al clap en&s;ued, and a general cry of&mdash;"The &s;tory! The &s;tory!" He then proceeded thus&mdash;"You mu&s;t know, ladies and gentlemen, that there lived in this city an hone&s;t old tren|cher-maker, who had &s;aved a very con&s;iderable fortune; and, having two &s;ons, called Kill 'em All and Ki&s;s my Ar&s;e, he left all his landed e&s;tate to his elde&s;t &s;on Kill 'em All, and all his bu|&s;ine&s;s and &s;tock in trade to his younge&s;t &s;on Ki&s;s my Ar&s;e. Now it happened, ladies and gentlemen, that Kill 'em All in a few years prodigally &s;pent his patrimony; and, what does he do, but &s;et up his bu&s;ine&s;s of trencher-making directly under the no&s;e of his brother Ki&s;s my Ar&s;e. It is an old &s;aying, that two of a trade can never agree, and I am &s;ure it is a true one; for no &s;ooner was this oppo&s;ition began, than the two brothers began to hate the &s;ight of each other; &s;o that if they both chanced to be at the play on the &s;ame night, you would &s;ee Kill 'em All in the pit, and Ki&s;s my Ar&s;e in the gallery; or el&s;e Kill 'em All in the gallery, and Ki&s;s my Ar&s;e in the pit. Indeed, &s;ometimes you might &s;ee Kill 'em All in the pit, or gallery, and Ki&s;s my Ar&s;e in the boxes. By and by, they got into a paper war; but, as neither of them could write them|&s;elves, they employed &s;cribblers on each &s;ide to do it for them; &s;o Kill 'em All cho&s;e your humble &s;ervant, and Ki&s;s my Ar&s;e Mr. Pope," bowing to him. "Soon after the commence|ment of the paper war, they went to law with each other about defamation. Kill 'em All cho&s;e for coun&s;el the Solici|tor-General, and Ki&s;s my Ar&s;e Mr. Attorney-General: no, I mi&s;take; Kill 'em All cho&s;e the Attorney-General, and Ki&s;s my Ar&s;e Mr. Solicitor;" bowing occa&s;ionally to both. "At la&s;t, by the interpo&s;ition of friends, they agreed to &s;ubmit to an arbitration; and then it was finally &s;ettled, that, to obviate all &s;ub&s;equent di&s;putes, Kill 'em All's trenchers &s;hould for the future be made all &s;quare, and tho&s;e of Ki&s;s my Ar&s;e all round."</P>
<P>This piece of humour was received with great applau&s;e, and Cibber fairly won his wager.</P>

<BYLINE>BY MR. JOHN MARTIN.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>ONCE on a time, as I've heard &s;ay</L>
<L>&mdash;I neither know the year nor day&mdash;</L>
<L>The rain di&s;till'd from many a cloud,</L>
<L>The night was dark, the wind blew loud;</L>
<L>A country &s;quire, without a guide,</L>
<L>Where roads were bad, and heath was wide,</L>
<L>Attended by his &s;ervant Jerry,</L>
<L>Was travelling tow'rds the town of Bury.</L>
<L>The &s;quire had ne'er been bred in courts,</L>
<L>And yet was held, as fame reports,</L>
<L>Though he to wit made no pretence,</L>
<L>A &s;quire of more than common &s;en&s;e.</L>
<L>Jerry, who courage could not boa&s;t,</L>
<L>Thought every &s;heep he &s;aw a gho&s;t;</L>
<L>And mo&s;t devoutly pray'd he might</L>
<L>E&s;cape the terrors of that night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As they approach'd the common's &s;ide,</L>
<L>A pea&s;ant's cottage they e&s;pied;</L>
<L>There riding up, our weary &s;quire,</L>
<L>Held it mo&s;t prudent to enquire,</L>
<L>Being nothing le&s;s than wet to &s;kin,</L>
<L>Where he might find a whole&s;ome inn.</L>
<L>"No inns there are," replied the clown,</L>

<L>You'll find free entertainment there,</L>

<L>The ma&s;ter, with his wife and &s;ons,</L>
<L>De&s;cend the hall, and bid him enter;</L>
<L>Give him dry cloaths, and beg he'll venture</L>
<L>To take a gla&s;s of Coniack brandy!</L>
<L>And he, who hated words to bandy,</L>
<L>In idle, compliment'ry &s;peeches,</L>
<L>The brandy took, and eke the breeches.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The liquor drank, the garments chang'd,</L>

<L>"A di&s;h of coffee, and a toa&s;t!"</L>
<L>The mi&s;tre&s;s &s;mil'd: th' enraptur'd ho&s;t</L>

<HEAD>PLATE VIII. THE INDUSTRIOUS 'PRENTICE GROWN RICH, AND SHERIFF OF LONDON.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the pur&s;uits of Thomas Idle, the vicious Appren|tice, are conducting him to ignominy and di&s;grace, Francis Goodchild, by per&s;everance in virtuous and indu&s;tri|ous habits, acquires opulence and fame, which render him an object of his fellow-citizens notice, and elevate him to the honour of being cho&s;en Sheriff of London.</P>

<P>While the cooks are bu&s;ily engaged, in bringing new &s;upplies for the mouth, the mu&s;icians, in an elevated gallery, are &s;till more actively employed in regaling the citizens ear.</P>

<P>In the mid&s;t of fe&s;tive &s;cene, however, Hogarth has intro|duced, at the right corner of the Print, a moro&s;e Beadle, with all the con&s;equential in&s;olence of a beggar in office, holding up and reading a letter, directed to Francis Goodchild, E&s;q.

<HEAD>THE ART OF EAR-TICKLING.</HEAD>
<P>HUMAN nature, though every where the &s;ame, is &s;o &s;eem|ingly diver&s;ified by the various habits and cu&s;toms of dif|ferent countries, and &s;o blended with the early impre&s;&s;ions we receive from our education, that they are often confounded to|gether, and mi&s;taken for one another. This makes us look with a&s;toni&s;hment upon all cu&s;toms that are extremely different from our own, and hardly allow tho&s;e nations to be of the &s;ame nature with our&s;elves, if they are unlike us in their man|ners; whereas, all human actions may be traced up to the&s;e two great motives, the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure and the avoidance of pain; and, upon a &s;trict examination, we &s;hall often find that tho&s;e cu&s;toms which at fir&s;t view &s;eem the mo&s;t different from our own, have in reality a great analogy with them.</P>
<P>What more particularly &s;ugge&s;ted this thought to me, was an account which a gentleman, who was lately returned from China, gave, in a company where I happened to be pre&s;ent, of a plea&s;ure held in high e&s;teem, and extremely practi&s;ed by that luxurious nation. He told us that the Tickling of the Ears was one of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations known in China; and that the delight admini&s;tered to the whole frame, through this organ, could by an able and &s;kilful Tickler be rai&s;ed to whatever degree of exta&s;y the patient &s;hould de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The company, &s;truck with this novelty, expre&s;&s;ed their &s;ur|prize, as is u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions, fir&s;t by a &s;illy &s;ilence, and then by many &s;illy que&s;tions. The account, too, coming &s;o far as from China, rai&s;ed both their wonder and their curio&s;ity, much more than if it had come from any European country, and opened a larger field for pertinent que&s;tions. Among others, the gentleman was a&s;ked, whether the Chine&s;e ears and fingers had the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to ours; to which having an&s;wered in the affirmative, he went on thus: "I peceive I have excited your curio&s;ity &s;o much by mentioning a cu&s;tom unknown to you here, that I believe it will not be di&s;agreeable if I give you a particular account of it.</P>
<P>"This plea&s;ure, &s;trange as it may &s;eem to you, is in China reckoned almo&s;t equal to any that the &s;en&s;es afford. There is not an ear in the whole country untickled; and the Ticklers have, in their turn, others who tickle them; in&s;omuch that there is a circulation of Tickling throughout that va&s;t empire. And if by chance there be &s;ome few unhappy enough not to find Ticklers, or &s;ome Ticklers clum&s;y enough not to find bu&s;ine&s;s, they comfort them&s;elves at lea&s;t with &s;elf-titillation.</P>
<P>"This profe&s;&s;ion is one of the mo&s;t lucrative and con&s;ider|able ones in China, the mo&s;t eminent performers being either
<PB N="172" REF="195">hand&s;omely requited in money, or &s;till better rewarded by the credit and influence it gives them with the party tickled; in&s;omuch that a man's fortune is made as &s;oon as he gets to be Tickler to any con&s;iderable Mandarine.</P>
<P>"The Emperor, as in ju&s;tice he ought, enjoys this plea|&s;ure in it's highe&s;t perfection; and all the con&s;iderable people contend for the honour and advantage of this employment, the per&s;on who &s;ucceeds the be&s;t in it being always the fir&s;t favourite and chief di&s;pen&s;er of his imperial power. The principal Mandarines are allowed to try their hands upon his Maje&s;ty's &s;acred ears; and, according to their dexterity and agility, com|monly ri&s;e to the po&s;ts of fir&s;t mini&s;ters. His wives, too, are admitted to try their &s;kill; and &s;he, among them, who holds him by the ear, is teckoned to have the &s;ure&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting hold. His pre&s;ent imperial Maje&s;ty's ears, as I am informed, are by no means of a delicate texture, and con&s;equently not quick of &s;en&s;ation; &s;o that it has proved extremely difficult to nick the tone of them: the lighte&s;t and fine&s;t hands have urterly failed; and many have mi&s;carried who, from either fear or re&s;pect, did not treat the royal ears &s;o roughly as was nece&s;&s;ary. He began his reign under the hands of a bungling operator, who for his clum&s;ine&s;s he &s;oon di&s;miffed; he was afterwards attempted by a more &s;kilful Tickler, but he &s;ometimes failed too; and, not being able to hit the humour of his maje&s;ty's ears, his own have often &s;uffered for it.</P>
<P>"In this publick di&s;tre&s;s, and while maje&s;ty laboured under the privation of auricular joys, the Empre&s;s, who by long ac|quaintance, and frequent little trials, judged pretty well of the texture of the royal ear, re&s;olved to undertake it; and &s;uc|ceeded perfectly, by means of a much &s;tronger friction than others dur&s;t either attempt or could imagine would plea&s;e.</P>
<P>"In the mean time, the &s;kilful Mandarine, far from being di&s;couraged by the ill &s;ucce&s;s he had &s;ometimes met with in his attempts upon the Emperor's ears, re&s;olved to make him&s;elf amends upon his imperial con&s;ort's: he tried, and he pre|vailed; he tickled her maje&s;ty's ear with &s;uch perfection, that as the Emperor would tru&s;t his ear to none but the Empre&s;s, &s;he would tru&s;t her's to none but this light-fingered Mandarine, who by the&s;e means attained to unbounded and uncontrouled power, and governed ear by ear.</P>
<P>"But as all the Mandarines have their Ear-Ticklers too, with the &s;ame degree of influence over them, and as this Man|darine was particularly remarkable for his extreme &s;en&s;ibility in tho&s;e parts, it is hard to &s;ay from what original titillation the imperial power now flows."</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of the gentleman's &s;tory was attended with
<PB N="173" REF="196">the u&s;ual interjections of wonder and &s;urprize from the com|pany: &s;ome called it &s;trange, &s;ome odd, and &s;ome very comi|cal; and tho&s;e who thought it the mo&s;t improbable, I found by their que&s;tions were the mo&s;t de&s;irous to believe it. I ob|&s;erved, too, that while the &s;tory la&s;ted, they were mo&s;t of them trying the experiment upon their own ears, but without any vi&s;ible effect that I could perceive.</P>
<P>Soon afterwards, the company broke up, and I went home; where I could not help reflecting, with &s;ome degree of wonder, on the wonder of the re&s;t; becau&s;e I could &s;ee nothing extra|ordinary in the power which the ear exerci&s;ed in China, when I con&s;idered the exten&s;ive influence of that important organ in Europe. Here, as in China, it is the &s;ource of both plea&s;ure and power; the manner of applying it is only different. Here the titillation is vocal; there it is manual: but the effects are the &s;ame; and, by the bye, European ears are not always un|acquainted, neither, with manual applications.</P>
<P>To make out the analogy I hinted at, between the Chine&s;e and our&s;elves in this particular, I will offer to my readers &s;ome in&s;tances of the &s;en&s;ibility and prevalency of the ears of Great Britain.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h ears &s;eem to be as greedy and &s;en&s;ible of titil|lation, as the Chine&s;e can po&s;&s;ibly be; nor is the profe&s;&s;ion of an Ear-Tickler here any ways inferior or le&s;s lucrative. There are three &s;orts: the Private Tickler, the Publick Tickler, and the Self-Tickler.</P>
<P>Flatrery is of of all methods the &s;ure&s;t to produce that vi|bration of the air which affects the auditory nerves with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite titillation: and, according to the thinner or thicker texture of tho&s;e organs, the flattery mu&s;t be more or le&s;s &s;trong. This is the immediate province of the Private Tickler, and his great &s;kill con&s;i&s;ts in tuning his flattery to the ear of his patient: it were endle&s;s to give in&s;tances of the in|fluence and advantages of tho&s;e arti&s;ts who excel in this way.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of a Publick Tickler is to modulate his voice, di&s;po&s;e his matter, and enforce his arguments, in &s;uch a man|ner as to excite a plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation in the ears of a number or a&s;&s;embly of people: this is the mo&s;t difficult branch of the profe&s;&s;ion, and that in which the fewe&s;t excel; but to the few who do, it is the mo&s;t lucrative, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. The bar has at pre&s;ent few proficients of this &s;ort; the pulpit none: the ladder, alone, &s;eems not to decline.</P>
<P>The Self-Tickler is as unhappy as contemptible: for, hav|ing none of the talents nece&s;&s;ary for tickling of others, and con&s;equently not worth being tickled by others neither, he is reduced to tickle him&s;elf; his own ears alone receive any titil|lation
<PB N="174" REF="197">from his own efforts. I know an eminent performer of this kind, who, by being nearly related to a &s;kilful publick Tickler, would fain &s;et up for the bu&s;ine&s;s him&s;elf; but has met with &s;uch repeated di&s;couragements, that he is reduced to the mortifying re&s;ource of &s;elf-titillation, in which he commit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mo&s;t horrid exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the proofs above-mentioned of the influence of the ear in this country, many of our mo&s;t common phra&s;es and ex|pre&s;&s;ions &mdash;from whence the genius of a people may always be collected&mdash;demon&s;trate, that the ear is reckoned the principal and mo&s;t predominant part of our whole mechani&s;m. To have the ear of one's prince, is under&s;tood by every body, to mean the having a good &s;hare of his authority, if not the whole; which plainly hints how that influence is acquired.</P>
<P>To have the ear of the fir&s;t mini&s;ter, is the next, if not an equal, advantage; I am therefore not &s;urprized, that &s;o con|&s;iderable a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hould be &s;o frequently attempted, and &s;o eagerly &s;olicited, as we may always ob&s;erve it is. But I mu&s;t caution the per&s;on who would make his fortune in this way, to confine his attempt &s;trictly to the ear in the &s;ingular number; a de&s;ign upon the ears, in the plural, of a fir&s;t mini&s;ter, being for the mo&s;t part rather difficult and dangerous, however ju&s;t.</P>
<P>To give ear to a per&s;on, implies giving credit, being con|vinced, and being guided by that per&s;on; and all this by the &s;ucce&s;s of his endeavours upon that prevailing organ.</P>
<P>To lend an ear is &s;omething le&s;s, but &s;till intimates a will|ingne&s;s and tendency in the lender to be prevailed upon by a little more tickling of that part. Thus, the lending of an ear is a &s;ure pre&s;age of &s;ucce&s;s to a &s;kilful Tickler. For example, a per&s;on who lends an ear to a mini&s;ter &s;eldom fails of putting them both in his power &s;oon afterwards; and when a fine wo|man lends an ear to a lover, &s;he &s;hews a di&s;po&s;ition at lea&s;t to farther and future titillation.</P>
<P>To be deaf and &s;top one's ears, are common and known ex|pre&s;&s;ions to &s;ignify a total refu&s;al and rejection of a per&s;on or propo&s;ition; in which ca&s;e I have often ob&s;erved the manual application to &s;ucceed by a &s;trong vellication or vigorous per|cu&s;&s;ion of the outward membranes of the ear.</P>
<P>There cannot be a &s;tronger in&s;tance of the great value that has always been &s;et upon the&s;e parts, than the con&s;tant manner of expre&s;&s;ing the utmo&s;t and mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire people can have for any thing, by &s;aying they would give their ears for it: a price &s;o great, that it is &s;eldom either paid or required; wit|ne&s;s the numbers of people actually wearing their ears &s;till, who in ju&s;tice have long &s;ince forfeited them.</P>
<P>Over head and ears, would be a manife&s;t pleona&s;mus, the head being higher than the ears, were not the ears reckoned
<PB N="175" REF="198">&s;o much more valuable than all the re&s;t of the head, as to make it a true climax.</P>
<P>It were unnece&s;&s;ary to mention, as farther proofs of the im|portance and dignity of tho&s;e organs, that pulling, boxing, or cutting off the ears, are the highe&s;t in&s;ults that cholerick men of honour can either give or receive: which &s;hews that the ear is the &s;eat of honour, as well as of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The anatomi&s;ts have di&s;covered that there is an intimate corre&s;pondence between the palm of the hand and the ear, and that a previous application to the hand communicates it&s;elf in|&s;tantly, by the force and velocity of attraction, to the ear, and agreeably prepares that part to receive and admit of titillation. I mu&s;t &s;ay, too, that I have known this practi&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s upon very con&s;iderable per&s;ons of both &s;exes.</P>
<P>Having thus demon&s;trated, by many in&s;tances, that the ear is the mo&s;t material part in the whole mechani&s;m of our &s;truc|ture, and that it is both the &s;eat and &s;ource of honour, power, plea&s;ure, and pain; I cannot conclude without an earne&s;t ex|hortation to all my country-folks, of what&s;oever rank or &s;ex, to take the utmo&s;t care of their ears. Guard your ears, O ye princes, for your power is lodged in your ears!&mdash;Guard your ears, ye nobles, for your honour lies in your ears!&mdash;Guard your ears, ye fair, if you would guard your virtue!&mdash;And guard your ears, all my fellow-&s;ubjects, if you would guard your liberties and properties!</P>

<HEAD>THE NINE LIVES OF A CAT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY BONNEL THRONTON, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<P>"HE has as many Lives as a Cat," &s;aid a gentleman the other day in company, &s;peaking of his friend, who had run through a perpetual cour&s;e of riot and debauchery, and had ju&s;t recovered from a violent fever occa&s;ioned by his intem|perance. The thought &s;truck me, that too many, indeed, &s;eem to be as regardle&s;s of their pre&s;ent exi&s;tence as if they imagined they could die more than once. I pur&s;ued my thought &s;till farther; and concluded, that the greate&s;t part of mankind, were they even po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of as many Lives, we will &s;ay, as a Cat, would be indifferent to them all; at lea&s;t, they would wantonly throw away the eight, however careful and &s;tudious &s;ome of them might be to pre&s;erve the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a man, then, to have as many Lives as a Cat: let us &s;ee what glorious u&s;e he would make of this extraordinary privilege. Mu&s;t it not be a great incitement to him to ha|zard them repeatedly upon honourable and virtuous occa&s;ions? I grant it: and it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be granted to me, that they
<PB N="176" REF="199">would equally be lavi&s;hed away upon trivial, di&s;honourable, and wicked occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Alexander, had he had nine times Nine Lives to lo&s;e, would have ri&s;qued every jot of them to conquer as many worlds. Let me a&s;k, whether the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, or the Marquis of Granby, would not as chearfully run the &s;ame hazard? But would&mdash; and &mdash; (O that Engli&s;hmen could not fill the blanks up!) have done the &s;ame? Perhaps they might have ventured &s;ome portion of their precious Lives; perhaps they might have poured out &s;ome part of the vapid mixture, drop by drop, &s;till careful of the la&s;t dregs: they, perhaps, like the mi&s;er who plays for gain, might have been tempted to &s;take a little of their fortune; but could never have been prevailed on, like the bold and generous game&s;ter, to throw for, the whole. They, in fine, would &s;carcely have &s;et (to borrow an expre&s;&s;ion of Shake&s;peare) "even one of their Nine Lives on the hazard of the die."</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, let us take a view of the&s;e brethren of the blade, to whom the one Life, which is &s;paringly be&s;towed on us mortals, &s;eems &s;carce worth the having. I &s;uppo&s;e it to appear &s;o to them, from their readine&s;s to re&s;ign it them&s;elves, or to take it away from others, upon any occa&s;ion; or, if you will, (in the Hibernian phra&s;e) upon no occa&s;ion at all. One in&s;tance &s;hall &s;erve for all. Suppo&s;e there are eighteen Lives between us: I tread upon your toe; &s;atisfaction is demanded, and is honourably given by your firing at my brains, which are mi&s;&s;ed. We have Lives enough to &s;pare; and you have a no&s;e le&s;t for me to pull: I handle it; in con&s;equence, I fire at your brains, and cannot hit them. What, then, is to be done? Why, nothing is to be done: only you are to kick me; that is all. I turn about, draw my &s;word; and, like men of ho|nour, we mu&s;t each of us lo&s;e one of our Nine Lives before we part friends. I am, indeed, &s;en&s;ible, that the punctilios of nice honour would induce the profe&s;&s;ors of it to a&s;k this gen|man-like que&s;tion before the engagement&mdash;"Pray, Sir, how many Lives have you to lo&s;e?" And there is no doubt, upon a di&s;parity, that the &s;econds would take care that the princi|pals &s;hould be &s;o far upon an equality, that the longe&s;t-to-be-liver &s;hould be fir&s;t put to death, as often as was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, till the combatants were in that re&s;pect at par.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, undoubtedly, be allowed me, where the antago|ni&s;ts are equal, or made equal by the foregoing method, that one or other of the parties would Nine times kill, or Nine times be killed, provided he has rea&s;on to cry out, with Othello&mdash;
<Q><L>"Though all his hairs were Lives,</L>
<L>My great revenge has &s;tomach for them all!"</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="200">The bravery of a man fighting a duel with him&s;elf, without &s;econd or antagoni&s;t, vulgarly called &s;elf-murder, is frequently manife&s;ted even in our pre&s;ent &s;tate of exi&s;tence, where we have but one Life to lo&s;e. It mu&s;t therefore be granted, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of our Lives being multiplied to Nine, that &s;ui|cide would become a general fa&s;hion among us; though, in eight in&s;tances out of Nine, it would betray a meanne&s;s of &s;pirit. We &s;hould never be induced to believe a man was tired of him&s;elf in real earne&s;t, though he had got rid of him&s;elf ever &s;o often, except he fairly &s;ent him&s;elf out of the world for the Ninth and la&s;t time.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, that a man of quality has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad a run of ill-luck at the hazard-table, to be &s;ure he would &s;hoot him&s;elf through the head directly. Upon his reviving, he tries his fortune a &s;econd time; and is reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of running him&s;elf through the heart. After his recovery, he is obliged repeatedly to make u&s;e of the &s;ame, or other methods, that the lo&s;&s;es of his Lives may be even with the lo&s;&s;es of his e&s;tate. Would not this unha&s;ty behaviour &s;hew a love for his precious Lives, &s;ince he would not put an end to all Nine of them directly, one after another?</P>
<P>To prove &s;uch behaviour to be quite mean and vulgar, let us farther &s;uppo&s;e that a cobler jerks his awl up between the third and fourth rib&mdash;(I kill my heroes with the &s;ame preci&s;ion as is u&s;ed by Homer)&mdash;a barber takes a clean &s;troke ju&s;t under the chin; a taylor "makes his quietus with a bare bodkin:" I &s;hall have my &s;hoes heel-pieced, my beard &s;haved, and my doublet mended, notwith&s;tanding. The allu&s;ion is too obvi|ous about the end and the la&s;t: but I hope to be indulged on this &s;ubject in con&s;idering my taylor, not without propriety, as only the Ninth part of a man.</P>
<P>Many, many in&s;tances, might be thought of, to evince that a man, endowed with the Lives of a Cat, would get quit of the incumbrance of &s;upernumerary ones as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. Take a lover, for example: without a metaphor, he would be &s;o much enamoured as, literally, to die many times for the &s;ame or &s;ome other mi&s;tre&s;s. We will &s;uppo&s;e (what is mere &s;uppo&s;ition) a con&s;tant enamorato&mdash;upon the lea&s;t flight or in|difference, &s;uch as a frown, or a box on the ear, my &s;wain hur|ries away to Ro&s;amond's Pond: after drowning, he ri&s;es up to|lerably cooled. On another occa&s;ion, he &s;urveys the trees in the Dark Walk at Vauxhall, picks out a &s;tout branch, and with the lei&s;ure of your true lover's melancholy unties his garters; at the la&s;t he tucks him&s;elf up, and dangles till a hap|py pair comes in his way, and he is cut down. The lady, after all this proof of his affection, is &s;till &s;tony hearted. He dies,
<PB N="178" REF="201">and dies on, for her; and, having put him&s;elf out of eight of his exi&s;tences, can he be blamed if he re&s;erves the precious one &s;till remaining for a beauty, or a fortune, or a woman of quality&mdash;or his maid?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e again, (for there can be no end of &s;uch-like &s;uppo|&s;itions) that I am an author: my works, indeed, I flatter my|&s;elf, will live after me; but, though I had all the Lives of a Cat, through each of them I might lead the life of a dog. My garret (we will &s;ay) has in&s;pired me to &s;oar &s;o high as to attempt a &s;ublime ode, or epick poem. I am let down by it's want of &s;ale. The beam acro&s;s my chamber is very inviting; and, at lea&s;t, the bed-cords are remaining. I am afterwards lowered to humble pro&s;e. My publi&s;her will not afford me &s;mall-beer; and I chu&s;e to have my fill of water by a plunge into the River Thames. After &s;inking and &s;oaring for eight times alternate|ly, I at la&s;t &s;it down contented in a gaol, to &s;upply copy, &s;crap by &s;crap, as the printer's little imp calls for it; &s;ince, as the proverb has it, "he mu&s;t needs go whom the Devil drives."</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay very little of the bold methods which bucks and bloods would take delight in to &s;horten their Lives, were they ever &s;o many; for the&s;e are obvious, and continually practi&s;ed, even in the pre&s;ent narrow &s;pace of their exi&s;tence. How often would a choice &s;pirit, for example, be literally dead drunk; Would he &s;cruple to lay his Lives down one after the other, under the table, as long as he could be certain he &s;hould ri&s;e up, and &s;tand upon his legs again? The debauchee of every character would, doubtle&s;s, be as ha&s;ty to get rid of his load of Lives, as he is at pre&s;ent neglectful in pre&s;erving his &s;ingle one.</P>
<P>Upon this principle of each individual enjoying a multipli|city of Lives, let us farther con&s;ider, how a nation, or &s;ociety, or community of them, might exi&s;t. It may, I know, be urged, that Fielding him&s;elf, and all the &s;itting aldermen put together, would not be &s;ufficient to &s;upport the police. A man, you will &s;ay, would ri&s;que being hanged eight different times for eight different capital offences, re&s;olving to be very hone&s;t afterwards for the remainder of his Lives. Granted. But in &s;uch a ca&s;e, it is mo&s;t probable, that the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;la|ture would direct that a convict &s;hould be &s;entenced to be hanged, like a Cat, till he were dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead!</P>
<P>I went to bed, after having written thus far, reflecting, that no man &s;hould be entitled to a &s;econd exi&s;tence&mdash;I mean in our mortal &s;tate&mdash;without having made a proper u&s;e of the fir&s;t. This reflection was &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon my
<PB N="179" REF="202">mind, that T'was able to employ the &s;ucceeding morning in &s;et|ting down the particulars of a dream occa&s;ioned by it.</P>
<P>I imagined that every one was indulged with a privilege, after death, of having his exi&s;tence renewed; but with this re&s;triction, that he could prove that he had not forfeited his former Life by not &s;etting a proper value on it. I accordingly conceived my&s;elf in a &s;ort of court of claims; where a number of us were brought by Death, in order to be examined about our preten&s;ions to be revivified. The &s;ight of the crowd &s;truck me with horror: &s;ome appeared to be covered with blains and blotches; &s;ome quite emaciated; and &s;ome with bloated carca&s;es. One bore the marks of a tight knot under the left ear; another had his &s;cull &s;hattered to pieces; and an|other had a great ga&s;h in his &s;ide. Milton's de&s;cription of a lazar-hou&s;e falls far &s;hort of what I then thought I &s;aw.</P>
<P>Truth and Ju&s;tice were the examinants; and the candidates for a new life underwent a &s;trict &s;crutiny. The fir&s;t that I ob|&s;erved was called before them, &s;tepped up with a bold air, and claimed a new exi&s;tence on account of his having died for his country. The plea was not approved of; for a common &s;ol|dier, who had fallen in the &s;ame battle, depo&s;ed that he him|&s;elf &s;hot him in an engagement where the enemy was inferior, at the in&s;tant that this commander had ordered a retreat. The &s;oldier was directly rein&s;tated into Life.</P>
<P>A jolly per&s;onage was next examined; and he pretended that he was accidentally choaked by a turtle-fin; though the new&s;|papers had fal&s;ely attributed his death to an apoplectick &s;it. It being proved upon him that he had dined the day before, and eat heartily upon turbot and veni&s;on, and that he had drank plentifully of old hock and claret, the court <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecreed that he died of a &s;urfeit, and refu&s;ed to indulge him in any more good living.</P>
<P>A mere &s;keleton crawled up next, and declared that he only wi&s;hed to be made alive again for the &s;ervice of the fair &s;ex. From his examination it was manife&s;t that he had &s;pent his life in and about Covent-Garden. He was adjudged, upon his own plea, unfit to exi&s;t again.</P>
<P>The next was an old decrepid figure, &s;eemingly worn down with age and cares. His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uit for the renewal of his Life was, in compa&s;&s;ion to him, rejected; becau&s;e it plainly appeared that he had already dragged out a mo&s;t mi&s;erable one, and had actually died of want in the mid&s;t of abundance. His &s;on put in a petition for his re-exi&s;tence at the very &s;ame time; &s;etting forth, that he was reduced, by the mean &s;pirit of his father, to die an untimely death at Tyburn. The compa&s;&s;ion of the court in not &s;uffering him to live again was al&s;o extended to
<PB N="180" REF="203">the young gentleman, on account of his tender years; there being little doubt but that he would come to the &s;ame untimely end, let his Lives be renewed ever &s;o often.</P>
<P>A blunt young fellow, not le&s;s than &s;ix feet high, next in|&s;i&s;ted upon being re&s;tored to Life. Another of the &s;ame make, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, in&s;i&s;ted upon the like. They had each of them, in the honourable way, put each other to death. It was determined, upon hearing both parties &s;eparately, that neither of them &s;hould run the ri&s;que of being put to death again, as neither of them would allow that the other de&s;erved to live.</P>
<P>A horrid &s;pectacle next pre&s;ented it&s;elf: he mo&s;t earne&s;tly reque&s;ted to enjoy again that being which, he confe&s;&s;ed, he had ra&s;hly and de&s;perately got rid of. His reque&s;t was not grant|ed; becau&s;e it was certain that the &s;ame would be repeated upon the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, in imagination, even &s;ome ladies of quality, who wi&s;hed to have their beauty renewed, together with their Lives: mo&s;t of them had died at publick places, where they went for the recovery of their health.</P>
<P>My dream was put an end to all of a &s;udden, by being my|&s;elf &s;ummoned up to give a rea&s;on why I &s;hould be glad to exi&s;t again. I pleaded guilty; and awaked, upon &s;entence being pro|nounced, that I &s;hould &s;tarve again as an author.</P>

<HEAD>A MODERN JUSTICE OF PEACE. DRAWN FROM THE LIFE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"Pray &s;end me the Ax re Latin to Augu&s;tus Peas."</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MY motto is a true and genuine &s;pecimen of the profound learning of a modern Ju&s;tice; and to whom Shak|&s;peare's Shallow was not fit to hold a candle: it was an order from one of that learned body to his book&s;eller, to &s;end him the acts relating to a Ju&s;tice of Peace; and doth &s;ufficiently di&s;play his capacity of judging of the laws, and deciding the diffe|rences and di&s;putes among his Maje&s;ty's good &s;ubjects. And there can be, I think, no doubt, but as &s;oon as he got the Ax, he hewed the laws with wonderful &s;kill and ability. How many &s;uch wor&s;hipful magi&s;trates there are in the kingdom, I can|not pretend to &s;ay; but whoever will look back for thirty years pa&s;t, will confe&s;s, that there hath, within that time, been a very extraordinary alteration in the general ju&s;tice&s;hip of this kingdom.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of honour and fortune, in their &s;everal counties, u&s;ed to be appointed, and thought it no di&s;grace to act as
<PB N="181" REF="204">Ju&s;tices: but &s;ince faction hath &s;hed it's baneful infl&uacute;ence, and every thing hath been carried by the current of corruption; &s;ince party-zeal, and a ready &s;ub&s;erviency to mini&s;terial mea|&s;ures, have been thought the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary qualifications for a magi&s;trate; and &s;ince a lower &s;et of people, as being pro|pere&s;t for &s;uch &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;es, have been advanced to the &s;eat of ju&s;tice, gentlemen of honour and fortune have, in general, not caring for &s;uch work, or &s;uch company, declined acting.

<P>Methought John made out the mittimus, and the con&s;table carried off the bacon-friers, and the re&s;t of the company were &s;ent away; and while I was wondering what his wor&s;hip could mean by committing the man and his wife for frying bacon, the &s;cene changed, and a court of judicature, with all it's for|malities, pre&s;ented it&s;elf: the judge was &s;itting on the bench,
<PB N="183" REF="206">and a numerous body of black gowns, and others, attending; and Mr. Augu&s;tus Peas came into court, and &s;eated him&s;elf not far from his Lord&s;hip; when the trial of Thomas and Mary Blabtruth, for frying bacon, was called. "For frying bacon!" quoth the judge. "What is the meaning of this? I never heard that frying bacon was a crime, or again&s;t law, before! Who committed the&s;e per&s;ons?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I committed them, my lord; it is again&s;t law, and a high mi&s;dammer.</P>

<P>Here is the book, my lord, and here is the place! Giving the book to his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>The Judge, having ca&s;t his eye upon the page, bur&s;t out into a loud laugh; and, with much ado for laughing, acquainted the court, that the law, which Mr. Augu&s;tus had taken to be again&s;t frying bacon, was that again&s;t firing a beacon; which put the whole court into &s;uch a loud "Ha, ha!" as awaked me.</P>

<HEAD>CURIOUS INVESTIGATION OF THE RIGHT TO EAT. FOUNDED ON PAINE'S RIGHTS OF MAN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SIR BROOKE BOOTHBY, BART.</BYLINE>
<P>WHETHER from timidity or prudence, the author of "Rights of Man" has not carried his principles to their fair extent. He has left untouched a thou&s;and rights nece&s;&s;a|rily flowing from the impre&s;criptible and unalienable equality of man in &s;ociety. The right to <HI>eat,</HI> for example, is at lea&s;t as natural and impre&s;criptible as the right to legi&s;late; it is &s;omewhat more nece&s;&s;ary, and of as ancient and divine origi|nal; and when dre&s;&s;ed out in a philo&s;ophical uniform, makes, in my opinion, ju&s;t as good a figure. Man is an organized entity who&s;e vitality con&s;i&s;ts in the action and re-action of &s;olid and fluid parts according to the laws of animal motion, which re|quire to be frequently &s;upplied and renewed by the ad&s;citition of elements taken into the mouth, ma&s;ticated by the teeth, in|gurgitated by the gullet, received into the &s;tomach; and there, by trituration, fermentation, and the re&s;t of the chemico-me|chanical proce&s;s of dige&s;tion, prepared and a&s;&s;imilated for the purpo&s;e of continuing animality; and without which, by the natural and impre&s;criptible laws of animation, life mu&s;t cea&s;e; the right therefore to <HI>eat</HI> is "one of tho&s;e natural rights which appertain to man in right of his exi&s;tance;" "one of tho&s;e
<PB N="184" REF="207">which he mu&s;t retain in &s;ociety, becau&s;e the power to execute it is as perfect in the individual as the right it&s;elf. It is al&s;o as ancient and of as divine original as that greate&s;t of all truths the unity or equality of man," and certainly as "advan|tageous to cultivate."&mdash;"And God &s;aid, Behold I have given you every herb bearing &s;eed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree on the which there is the fruit of a tree yielding &s;eed: to you it &s;hall be for meat."&mdash;" Here we are got at the origin of man, and the origin of his rights: how the world has been governed from that day to this is no concern of ours; every civil right grows out of a natural right, and <HI>can|not invade</HI> tho&s;e natural rights in which the power to execute is as perfect as the right it&s;elf." Hence it follows, that the man who appropriates to him&s;elf a greater quantity of the food given by God equally to all, than is nece&s;&s;ary for his own con&s;ump|tion, acts in defiance of the natural impre&s;criptible equal rights of man; and that he who goes into the kitchen or larder of this invader of his natural rights, and &s;eizes upon what he wants, acts in &s;trict conformity to tho&s;e rights which <HI>&s;ociety cannot invade;</HI> and as to the laws again&s;t theft or burglary, they are not only in contradiction with the unalienable equal rights of man, but were made by men who having cea&s;ed to be, have no longer any authority in directing how the government of the world &s;hall be organized or admini&s;tered. It is the liv|ing and not the dead that are to be accomodated; the rights of the living cannot be willed away by the manu&s;cript authority of the dead!</P>

<HEAD>EPISTLE FROM COMMON HONESTY TO COMMON SENSE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>LOVING KINSMAN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;evere treatment I have con&s;tantly met with, and the univer&s;al &s;corn and contempt &s;o manife&s;tly &s;hewn me by all ranks and degrees of men, have &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affected my con|&s;titution, that I once thought of nothing le&s;s than making a total exit from this ungrateful world. But the kind reception which you&mdash;who are well known to be a collateral branch of our family&mdash;have lately met with, has &s;omewhat rai&s;ed my drooping &s;pirits, and encouraged me to &s;hew my head once more; though I am &s;o worn to a &s;keleton, that the few of my friends and acquaintance who are yet living, I believe, will hardly know me again.</P>
<P>When I &s;peak of my own &s;ufferings, you may, perhaps, be moved with &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion, as you reflect on the difficulties you have met with, and the &s;everities you have undergone, though no way comparable to what has become almo&s;t habi|tual to me.</P>
<P>You have, indeed, for &s;ome years, been under a &s;ort of pro|&s;cription from courts and mini&s;terial employments: but, at the &s;ame time, you have enjoyed a comfortable retreat with the few patriots who have renounced all preferments to adhere to you, and have not for&s;aken your cau&s;e in the wor&s;t of times: while I have not been only rendered incapable of publick tru&s;t; but, &s;uch has been the malice of my enemies, that I am even denied the happine&s;s of private &s;ociety, like a criminal branded with infamy. It is become &s;candalous, according to the pre|&s;ent mode, to be &s;een in my company, or to entertain the lea&s;t corre&s;pondence with me; though, God knows, I have always led a blamele&s;s, inoffen&s;ive life, and am &s;o univer&s;ally hated and de&s;pi&s;ed only becau&s;e I cannot help people to &s;upport the reigning luxury and extravagance, and grow rich all on a &s;ud|den, without either merit or laudable endeavours.</P>
<P>You know the misfortunes which be&s;el our family at a cer|tain time; and the deplorable condition I was left in, without any countenance or &s;upport, at an age when it could hardly be expected I &s;hould &s;hift for my&s;elf. However, I thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to endeavour getting into &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s for my imme|diate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and applied my&s;elf to a very eminent trade&s;|man in the city, reque&s;ting to be taken into his &s;ervice: but, to my great grief, this fir&s;t attempt proved un&s;ucce&s;sful. He told me, I could not be of any u&s;e to him in the retail way; that there was no in&s;tance of &s;uch a one as my&s;elf ever being behind a counter; and, in &s;hort, that he would not advi&s;e me
<PB N="196" REF="222">to think of being any way concerned in trade, for that I &s;hould not find any dealer fond of employing me, e&s;pecially as I was a foreigner, and not free of the city. However, in com|pa&s;&s;ion to my wants, the trade&s;man had good-nature enough to give me a letter of recommendation to a noted attorney of his acquaintance; who, as he a&s;&s;ured me, very much wanted my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and mu&s;t therefore be glad to entertain me on ho|nourable terms.</P>
<P>This &s;eeming friend&s;hip gave me &s;ome hopes; and I imme|diately went with my credentials as directed, being determined to apply my&s;elf wholly to that learned profe&s;&s;ion. I was &s;oon introduced; but, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible concern, met with a cold reception. He &s;at lolling in a great elbow-chair, and an|&s;wered me with a yawning&mdash;"What is your name, Sir?"&mdash; "Common Hone&s;ty, Sir," I replied. "Com&mdash;mon Hon&mdash;e&s;ty!" cries he, yawning again; "I have read the letter you brought, but am &s;ure Common Sen&s;e never fent you hither: I cannot, by any means, receive you into my hou&s;e; you can be of no manner of u&s;e to me in my branch of bu&s;i|ne&s;s: all the imaginary &s;ervices you may do, will never bear the expence of your maintenance, for I cannot employ you in one cau&s;e in twenty; if I &s;hould, I might be in danger of lo&s;ing many clients, who would naturally &s;u&s;pect your betray|ing their &s;ecrets; and if they were once to know I have any dealings with you, it would bla&s;t my character. Be&s;ides," adds he, "young man, were I minded to bear with all the&s;e inconveniences, at the reque&s;t of my friend who recommended you to me, you would never find the practice of the law turn to any account for your&s;elf: you are &s;o odious among tho&s;e of our profe&s;&s;ion, that it is a great que&s;tion with me whether you would ever be admitted as an attorney; but if you &s;hould, how will you live? Who the Devil do you think will employ you? Mo&s;t people will be afraid of tru&s;ting their bu&s;ine&s;s in your hands. Therefore, I would advi&s;e you to turn your thoughts to &s;ome other profe&s;&s;ion; and, if you can do nothing better, get your&s;elf ordained: you &s;urely cannot be obnoxious to the clergy; they will, at lea&s;t, give you &s;uch outward counte|nance, that you will never want a rea&s;onable &s;upport and maintenance."</P>
<P>Finding this &s;olid rea&s;oning would bear no contradiction, and being thoroughly convinced I had mi&s;taken my&s;elf greatly in this &s;econd attempt, I maturely con&s;idered the whole&s;ome advice given me, and began to form &s;ome method of putting it in execution; and, in effect &s;oon thought of a per&s;on I ima|gined very proper for my purpo&s;e: and who &s;hould this be, but a certain Right Reverend; who, when young, had great
<PB N="197" REF="223">obligations to our family, in recommending him to his fir&s;t preferment in the church; the remembrance of which, I hoped, would e&s;tabli&s;h me in his favour.</P>
<P>I attended him one morning early, and waited an hour be|fore I could be-admitted to an audience; when, my patience being almo&s;t worn out, on a &s;udden the word was given for the &s;tranger to come in to my lord. I immediately entered, and paid my re&s;pects to his lord&s;hip in a mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive man|ner. "How do you do, young man?" &s;ays the prelate: "I have not &s;een you a great while; I thought you was dend, or gone abroad. And pray what has brought you hither now?" I gave him the be&s;t account I could of my pa&s;t misfortunes, and pre&s;ent unhappy ca&s;e; and, while I was employing all my rhetorick to move his pity and compa&s;&s;ion, his lord&s;hip was reading, which inattention to my reque&s;t gave me little hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. At la&s;t, he &s;uddenly laid down his book, and turned up his head towards the cieling&mdash;for I remarked he could not look me in the face, and therefore I inferred he was a&s;hamed to &s;ee me&mdash;and then &s;poke thus&mdash;" You talk of the obliga|tions I have had to your family; I know of none: &s;ome little civilities, indeed, pa&s;&s;ed between me and them at college, when your father officiou&s;ly thru&s;t him&s;elf upon me as a tutor, and to direct me in my fir&s;t &s;etting out in the world: but if I had tru&s;ted to his judgment, under&s;tanding, or credit, I might have remained at college &s;till." And then he declared, he knew of no obligations he had to any one belonging to me; &s;o that he could not, in any &s;ort, intermeddle in my affairs, which he thought very incompatible with his &s;tation, and might be a hin|drance to his farther advancement; and wi&s;hed me to provide for my&s;elf in the be&s;t manner I could: "For," added he, "you may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, you will have no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from me."</P>
<P>From the example of this Right Reverend, and the di&s;cour&s;e I had with others of what pa&s;&s;ed at this interview, I was per|fectly &s;atisfied that, for the want of intere&s;t at court, which I knew my&s;elf to be wholly unprovided of, there were little hopes of preferment in this road, even if I &s;hould get ordained: the utmo&s;t to be expected was &s;ome poor Wel&s;h living, or a &s;tarving curacy in town. The&s;e re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lections, and the experi|ence I had, &s;oon weaned me of all thoughts of dedicating my|&s;elf to the &s;ervice of the church.</P>
<P>Having now tried: three different methods for my advance|ment, which I found impracticable, I knew not well what pro|ject next to fall on. In this &s;tate of uncertainty my wants daily increa&s;ed, which brought me almo&s;t to de&s;pair. How|ever, I walked out one morning and by accident met with a recruiting-&s;erjeant. I bethought my&s;elf the army refu&s;ed no|thing;
<PB N="198" REF="224">and therefore, &s;ince I could do no better, was deter|mined to li&s;t for a &s;oldier. I called the &s;erjeant a&s;ide, and of|fered my&s;elf to his di&s;po&s;al; telling him, at the &s;ame time, as is u&s;ual in like ca&s;es, my name and place of birth. The &s;er|jeant, in&s;tead of greedily embracing the offer, &s;tood &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, &s;cratching his forehead; and at la&s;t &s;aid&mdash;" I am afraid, my lad, you will never learn the military dicipline, or make any figure in the field: and, &s;hould you li&s;t in our regi|ment; you will be very trouble&s;ome, both on march, and in quarters; for no comrade will care to me&s;s with you. How|ever, as our captain is in great want of men, I will venture to introduce you."</P>
<P>We went away directly to the captain's quarters; where the &s;erjeant having told our bu&s;ine&s;s, and I having an&s;wered the &s;ame que&s;tions as before, our noble captain &s;hook his head, and &s;aid, I might perhaps be fit for &s;ea-&s;ervice, but that I was not of a proper &s;ize for his company; and then demanded of the &s;erjeant where he picked me up, and how he came ac|quainted with me. The &s;erjeant replied, with great truth, that he never &s;aw or heard of me before in his life, and acci|dentally met me a little while ago. "Send him packing then," cries the captain: "this fellow would make a mutiny in the regiment; be&s;ides, I know all his family are di&s;affected to the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment in church and &s;tate, and therefore I would not take him on any con&s;ideration."</P>
<P>My evil genius &s;till pur&s;uing me, I had recour&s;e to another expedient. I remembered my father, in his life-time, had a place in the Trea&s;ury, which he enjoyed till the death of his patron, a great man who pre&s;ided at that board, by which means I had &s;ome little in&s;ight into the bu&s;ine&s;s of that office; and therefore I had no more wit than to fancy I might be u&s;e|ful to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. I made, indeed, but a plain appearance as to dre&s;s; however, I re&s;olved to equip my&s;elf in the be&s;t man|ner I could, attend next morning at his levee, and try my for|tune once more.</P>
<P>On my arrival at his door, whether I was de&s;pi&s;ed for not being a beau, or for not coming in a coach, or whether I was taken for a Scotch lord ju&s;t come to town with my own wants and my ance&s;tors merits, I cannot &s;ay; but, to my great &s;ur-prize, Abraham Bra&s;s, the porter, told me his ma&s;ter was not at home. This I knew to be fal&s;e, and therefore would have gone in notwith&s;tanding, but Abraham &s;hut the door in my face.</P>
<P>I could not imagine the cau&s;e of this treatment, being &s;ure the fellow did not know me; however, having time to recol|lect my&s;elf a little, till opportunity offered, by opening the door
<PB N="199" REF="225">for &s;omebody's going out, I acco&s;ted Abraham very courte|ou&s;ly&mdash; "Sir," &s;ays I, "you have in&s;ulted me without any provocation; I mu&s;t de&s;ire to be admitted:" and told him my name, and the bu&s;ine&s;s I had with his ma&s;ter; who, I knew, often valued him&s;elf on his intimacy with my family. But, alas! I only made bad wor&s;e; he fell furiou&s;ly upon me in the mo&s;t opprobrious language imaginable; called me all the ra&s;|cals and &s;coundrels he could think on; &s;wore I &s;hould never enter the doors while he was porter, and that I only came there with &s;ome wicked de&s;ign on his per&s;on, or to rob the hou&s;e; and that, if I did not in&s;tantly depart and be gone, he would charge a con&s;table with me, and &s;wear the peace again&s;t me.</P>
<P>On this outrage I thought it proper to retire &s;ome di&s;tance from the door, where I took the opportunity, as &s;everal well-dre&s;&s;ed gentlemen were going in, to tell them my ca&s;e, with the abu&s;e I met with from Abraham; begging of them to ac|quaint his honour with the behaviour of his &s;ervant. But not a &s;ingle word could I get out of one of them: &s;ome &s;hook their heads, and others &s;tarted from me as if I had been in|fected. At la&s;t, a grave, elderly gentleman, with a bundle of papers in his hands, going into the great man's, &s;topped a little to hear my complaints, and was &s;o kind as to open his mouth. "I have," &s;ays he, "Sir, &s;ome &s;mall knowledge of your family, with whom I was acquainted before I came into a publick employment: but what bu&s;ine&s;s have you here? Complaining of Abraham Bra&s;s's behaviour will be to no pur|po&s;e: he knows his ma&s;ter's mind, to whom he ought to be civil, and whom he may be rude to; and, depend upon it, you are &s;o univer&s;ally hated by the whole family, who&s;e inte|re&s;t it is that you &s;hould never come within the&s;e doors, that you are not &s;afe in &s;taying longer &s;o near them, le&s;t a wor&s;e evil befal you: nay, I do not know, if it were &s;u&s;pected I now &s;peak to you in &s;o friendly a manner, but it might be as much as my place is worth; therefore I advi&s;e you to make off as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>By this time, kin&s;man, you may &s;uppo&s;e I was in a very melancholy condition: when I happened to meet with a coun|try gentleman; who, without any he&s;itation, on the fir&s;t re|pre&s;entation of my circum&s;tances, took me into his &s;ervice, and entertained me at his country-&s;eat with great kindne&s;s and humanity. He entru&s;ted me with the management of all his affairs, and advi&s;ed with me on the mo&s;t important tran&s;actions of his life. In this &s;ituation, I looked back on the mi&s;ery of my former condition with joy and &s;atisfaction, changed for the pre&s;ent; and, being arrived at the bounds of my ambition,
<PB N="200" REF="226">peace and content, de&s;pi&s;ed all worldly greatne&s;s with the &s;pirit of a philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>But as nothing in this world is permanent, the devil put it into my lady's head to live in town; and that my ma&s;ter might not oppo&s;e her de&s;ign, from the expences attending the re|moval; &s;he per&s;uaded him to offer him&s;elf as a candidate for the late election in a neighbouring borough, from the &s;ucce&s;s of which &s;he imagined great preferments would be had for the whole family. The &s;cheme was re&s;olved on; and I was pre|&s;ently di&s;patched away to the place of election, as one my ma&s;ter con&s;ided in, to make timely intere&s;t, he intending to follow me in a few days. I &s;et out on this errand with no very good will, foreboding my own de&s;truction in the event: and when I came to my journey's end, I met with as little &s;ucce&s;s. The electors, one and all, took a mortal antipathy to me at fir&s;t &s;ight; and, in&s;tead of &s;ecuring their friend&s;hip, I made every one of them my enemy: and, on my ma&s;ter's ar|rival, they in&s;i&s;ted I &s;hould be forthwith di&s;charged, or he mu&s;t not expect one vote there. My ma&s;ter's eagerne&s;s to &s;ucceed in this election tempted him to comply. Immediately I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, with a private intimation that, though I was u&s;ele&s;s in an election, yet if I went to town; and waited with patience, I &s;hould be taken in again for the management of my ma&s;ter's private affairs. I knew no remedy but &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. I went off as privately as I could; and, &s;oon after my ma&s;ter's arrival in town, I waited on him in hopes of what I expected being performed. But never was a man &s;o changed as my ma&s;ter: he told me, to my great grief and &s;urprize, that he had no farther &s;ervice for me of any kind, being now engaged to take other mea&s;ures than when he lived retired in the coun|try; that he was firmly re&s;olved never again to be under the re&s;traint of any other &s;ervant; that his election co&s;t him a deal of money for a double return, and all would be lo&s;t if he did not play his cards well; and, being under a &s;olemn en|gagement never to have any the lea&s;t corre&s;pondence with me, he concluded with forbidding me his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Having thus, loving kin&s;man, tried all rea&s;onable methods of getting a livelihood, and having at pre&s;ent no means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, my application, which is the la&s;t I &s;hall make, is to you; and, finding you have &s;et up a new work, my humble reque&s;t is to be taken into your &s;ervice.</P>
<P>There has formerly been a &s;trict union and friend&s;hip be|twixt the two branches of our family, Common Sen&s;e and Common Hone&s;ty; though I own yours to be of &s;uperior rank and dignity, having &s;upplied the world with many kings and queens. But, though we have not arrived to that honour,
<PB N="201" REF="227">you have found us u&s;eful in our &s;tation; and it can be proved by many in&s;tances in hi&s;tory, that Common Sen&s;e never flouri&s;hed, or made any con&s;iderable figure, without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of Common Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>I know the difficulties of my own condition, and how hard it is, un&s;upported, to make my way through the world: but as we have &s;o often contributed to your &s;upport, and none of your ance&s;tors ever met with any material check or misfortune while our branch of the family was countenanced by them; therefore, as we fell, &s;o I hope we &s;hall ri&s;e together.</P>
<P>I do not &s;u&s;pect you will ever write for the mini&s;try, in which ca&s;e I know I &s;hall be entirely u&s;ele&s;s to you; the only favour I a&s;k is &s;ome employment under you in the mean time, which will be gratefully acknowledged by your affectionate kin&s;man,</P>

<HEAD>THE STRANGE ADVENTURES OF MONSIEUR DE JARDIN.</HEAD>
<P>THE Count De Montalto &s;ent Mon&s;ieur De Jardin, one of his gentlemen, to Naples, with five hundred pi&s;toles, to buy hor&s;es; and, being arrived there, as he was &s;tanding the next evening in the gate of the inn, throwing his pur&s;e of gold from one hand to the other, he was ob&s;erved by a young courtezan, who wanted neither wit nor beauty: the next morning &s;he &s;ent one of her &s;pies privately to enquire who the object of her attention was, his bu&s;ine&s;s, and what other cir|cum&s;tances related to him, or could be of advantage to her de&s;ign. Being informed of particulars whereon to found her plot, &s;he di&s;patched one of her emi&s;&s;aries, a cunning gip&s;ey, to acquaint him, that a lady of quality, and a relation of his, entreated the favour of a vi&s;it. The crafty decoy hovered at a di&s;tance, till De Jardin came out; who, as was his cu&s;tom, &s;tanding at the gate alone, &s;he, with a mode&s;ty as counterfeit as her innocence, a&s;ked if Mon&s;ieur De Jardin was within. "Yes, my &s;weet girl," &s;ays he, "I am the per&s;on."&mdash;" Sig|nior," &s;ays &s;he, "my lady commands me to let you know &s;he has the honour to be related to you; and, if it is not too great a conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;he begs you would &s;pare half an hour from your more important affairs, and be&s;tow it on her." De Jardin was not much &s;urprized at &s;o obliging an invitation; for, though he knew of none of his relations, who either to bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the title of lady, or even lived in Naples; yet, pre&s;uming on the comeline&s;s of his per&s;on and good mien, he imagined it was &s;ome lady of quality who was enamoured of him, and
<PB N="202" REF="228">with this pretence courted an opportunity to di&s;cover her pa&s;&s;ion. "Madam," &s;ays he, "I could wi&s;h my&s;elf worthy of &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing as I now receive; and, &s;ince a ready &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to your lady's commands is the be&s;t proof I can give of my zeal and affection to her &s;ervice, I will this very minute pay my re&s;pects to her." De Jardin, without going into his lodging, went directly along with his guide; who led him through &s;everal cro&s;s &s;treets and bye-ways, till they came to the hou&s;e, which in the front appeared fair and reputable: at the door a per&s;on attended, who conducted De Jardin into a room richly furni&s;hed both for plea&s;ure and ta&s;te. As &s;oon as the lady was acquainted that Mon&s;ieur de Jardin was be|low, &s;he de&s;cended with a portly and maje&s;tick grace; which, le&s;t it &s;hould &s;trike too great an awe upon her kin&s;man, &s;he &s;weetened with an affectionate familiarity and re&s;pect. The wily courtezan &s;pread her net &s;o well, that his dull eye could not di&s;cover the lea&s;t deceit; &s;he di&s;played his pedi|gree with &s;o much artifice, that his ob&s;cure family was now derived from one of the mo&s;t noble hou&s;es of all Italy, of which &s;he had the honour to be no incon&s;iderable branch; all which his pride and folly ea&s;ily credited. Variety of di&s;|cour&s;e, with mutual congratulations for &s;o happy an inter|view, had now &s;pent a good part of the evening; when the lady was whi&s;pered in the ear that &s;upper was ready. She ordered it to be brought in; and though it was &s;plendid and elegant, &s;he courteou&s;ly pretended to excu&s;e it as not good enough for &s;o worthy a gue&s;t. Supper being over, De Jar|din recollecting it grew late, and that he was a &s;tranger to the &s;treets, was ready with a long harangue of thanks to take leave of &s;o honourable a kin&s;woman. A profu&s;ion of compli|ments were mutually exchanged; when, taking him by the hand, "Nay, cou&s;in," &s;ays &s;he, "though I am &s;en&s;ible your reception has not been equal to your merit, yet I flatter my|&s;elf that my hou&s;e can afford you better accommodations than your inn; and if you rob me of your company to-night, you have not that e&s;teem for me I am &s;o ambitious of." De Jar|din, who&s;e better genius was ab&s;ent, accepted the invitation.</P>
<P>It &s;oon grew bed-time, and De Jardin was attended to his apartment by the lady and two of her &s;ervants; who, after a &s;olemn "Good night!" withdrew. As he was &s;tepping into bed, the wine he had drank began to rumble in his &s;to|mach; for it had been phy&s;ically prepared for that purpo&s;e: he therefore a&s;ked one of the &s;ervants for a nece&s;&s;ary conve|nience, and was directed into a little room adjoining: his bu|&s;ine&s;s required ha&s;te. Boldly &s;tepping in, a board, which lay purpo&s;ely loo&s;e, gave way, and down he fell to the bottom of
<PB N="203" REF="229">the privy. As &s;oon as he had recovered him&s;elf from the fright&mdash;for hurt he received none, except from what was tran&s;acting above&mdash;he cried out for help; but nobody an|&s;wered, though he heard his kin&s;woman's voice very merry and loud: they were too bu&s;y in ran&s;acking his pockets, where they found the prize they wanted, with bulk unbroken. In this di&s;tre&s;s, he di&s;covered a wall which communicated with the &s;treet; this he endeavoured to &s;cale, but with repeat|ed &s;lips mired him&s;elf over head and ears. At la&s;t, however, he &s;ucceeded, and found him&s;elf in the middle of the &s;treet. By the light of the moon he gue&s;&s;ed at the hou&s;e, and rung &s;o loud a peal at the door, that a grim fellow opened a window, and a&s;ked what drunken knave gave that unmannerly alarm? "I am, Sir," &s;ays he, "the lady's cou&s;in."&mdash;"Sirrah," &s;ays he, "you are an impudent liar! I know no &s;uch per&s;on. Be gone in time, or you will too late repent this &s;aucy af|front." The approach of the watch at this in&s;tant forced De Jardin to break off the dialogue, and &s;ecure him&s;elf. As he was looking for a place of &s;helter, he &s;pied an open bulk, where in the day-time a cobler and an herbwoman kept their &s;hop; into which he crept as far as he could, to conceal him&s;elf till the watch was gone by. Three fellows, who that night de&s;igned to rob the tomb of a cardinal who had lately been buried in the great church, having hid their tools in this bulk, now came for them. De Jardin, hearing men talk, lay clo&s;e; but one of them groping for the implements, and often complaining of a horrible &s;mell, at la&s;t catched De Jardin by the leg. The &s;urprize was equal on both &s;ides; however, the fellow had the courage to pull him out, and examine what &s;ort of a creature lay concealed there. De Jardin's &s;hirt was &s;o offen&s;ive, that they forced him to &s;trip; for, con&s;idering he might be of u&s;e to them in their pre&s;ent de&s;ign, and had po&s;|&s;ibly overheard &s;ome of their di&s;cour&s;e, they compelled him to go along with them. Notwith&s;tanding he was now as naked as he was born, yet the filth was thick cru&s;ted upon his &s;kin, and the &s;mell &s;o noi&s;ome, they could not endure it. For this one of them thought of a proper remedy: hard by, there was a deep well, with a long chain and a bucket at the end of it; hither they brought De Jardin, put him into the bucket, let him down into the well, and told him that, as &s;oon as he had wa&s;hed him&s;elf clean, he mu&s;t &s;hake the chain, and they would draw him up. While they &s;tayed for De Jardin, the watch came, it being very hot, to refre&s;h them&s;elves with water, the only beverage that could be had at that hour. His companions were now forced to run and hide; and the watch laid down their cloaks and halberts, and drew up the bucket. De Jar|din
<PB N="204" REF="230">with a &s;udden &s;pring leaped a&s;hore, which &s;truck &s;uch a panick upon them, that they fled, leaving the pillage of the field, their cloaks and halberts, to De Jardin and his com|rades. Having now joined company again, they went di|rectly to the cardinal's tomb, and rai&s;ed up the heavy marble: but a di&s;pute aro&s;e who &s;hould go in. De Jardin would not. "No," &s;ays one of them; "wont you? but you &s;hall: what did we bring you here for el&s;e?" They &s;oon forced De Jardin to de&s;cend; and he reached them out the mitre and cro&s;ier, and pulled off the cardinal's gold fringe gloves, which were richly embroidered. He had heard them men|tion a diamond-ring of great value; and this he &s;lipt off, and put upon his own finger, to &s;ecure &s;omething in ca&s;e of the wor&s;t. They &s;till bade him look for the ring: he told them he could find none; and they mu&s;t come in, if they either &s;u&s;pected his honour or hone&s;ty, and look for it them&s;elves. "I am &s;ure," &s;aid one, "it was &s;aid he had a very rich ring; feel upon the other hand." As they were thus argu|ing the ca&s;e, they heard a &s;udden noi&s;e in the church; which they &s;u&s;pected might be &s;ome of the officers: this frightened them &s;o, that away they ran, and let the &s;tone fall down, leav|ing poor De Jardin entombed with the dead cardinal. This was a misfortune a thou&s;and times wor&s;e than any that had yet befallen him: it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to rai&s;e up the &s;tone, and if he made a noi&s;e to di&s;cover him&s;elf, he would certainly be executed for &s;acrilege and robbing the dead; and to lie there and &s;tarve, or be poi&s;oned with the &s;tench of the corrupt|ing body, was &s;till more dreadful. It happened that the noi&s;e which frightened his companions proceeded from &s;ome per|&s;ons then breaking into the church upon the &s;ame de&s;ign: when they came to the tomb, they rai&s;ed up the marble, &s;trongly under-propped it, and began, like the others, to di&s;pute who &s;hould de&s;cend. "What," &s;ays one of them, a bold fellow, "are you afraid the dead cardinal &s;hould bite you? Let me come!"</P>
<P>As he was letting him&s;elf down, De Jardin catched fa&s;t hold of his legs; the fellow, frightened out of his wits, cried out, "Help! help! the cardinal has catched me by the legs!" and, &s;truggling, got out, and followed his compa|nions; who, every &s;tep they made, expected the cardinal would &s;eize them. This gave De Jardin an opportunity of e&s;caping. He immediately quitted the church by the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me way he had entered it; and, cloathed with one of the watch|men's cloaks, walked about till morning. When it was light, he enquired out his inn; where he borrowed &s;ome cloaths, and gave a terrible detail of his misfortunes&mdash;but not
<PB N="205" REF="231">a word of the ring. That evening he left Naples, and &s;et forward for France, without purcha&s;ing a &s;ingle hor&s;e; and, though he had lo&s;t his money and cloaths, he was in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a ring, the value of which at lea&s;t balanced the account.</P>

<HEAD>THE ARCHBISHOP'S LUCK. AN ODD ADVENTURE.</HEAD>
<P>AN archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, making a tour into the country, &s;topped at an inn for refre&s;hment. Being at the window, he ob&s;erved at a di&s;tance, in a &s;olitary wood, a well-dre&s;&s;ed man alone, talking, and acting a kind of part. The prelate's curio&s;ity was excited to know what the &s;tranger was about; and, accordingly, he &s;ent &s;ome of his &s;ervants to ob&s;erve him, and hear what he was rehear&s;ing: but they bringing him back an an&s;wer no way &s;atisfactory, his Grace re&s;olved to go him&s;elf. He accordingly repaired to the wood, ordering his attendants to remain at a di&s;tance. He addre&s;&s;ed the &s;tranger very politely, and was an&s;wered with the &s;ame civility. A conver&s;ation having been once entered into, though not with|out interruptions by an occa&s;ional &s;oliloquy, his Grace a&s;ked what he was about. "I am at play," he replied. "At play!" &s;aid the prelate; "and with whom? You are all alone."&mdash;"I own," &s;aid he, "Sir, you do not perceive my an|tagoni&s;t; but I am playing with God!"&mdash;His lord&s;hip thinking the man out of his mind, replied&mdash;"This is a very extraordinary party: and pray at what game, Sir, are you playing?"&mdash;"At che&s;s, Sir." The archbi&s;hop &s;miled; but the man &s;eeming peaceable, he was willing to amu&s;e him&s;elf with a few more que&s;tions. "And do you play for any thing, Sir?"&mdash;"Cer|tainly." &mdash;"You cannot have any great chance, as your ad|ver&s;ary mu&s;t be &s;o &s;uperior to you."&mdash;"He does not take any advantage, but plays merely like a man."&mdash;"Pray, Sir, when you win or lo&s;e, how do you &s;ettle your accounts?"&mdash;"Very exactly and punctually, I promi&s;e you."&mdash;"Indeed! Pray how. &s;tands your game?" The &s;tranger, after muttering &s;omething to him&s;elf, &s;aid&mdash;"I have ju&s;t lo&s;t it."&mdash;"And how much have you lo&s;t?"&mdash;"Fifty guineas."&mdash;"That is a great &s;um; how do you intend paying it? Does God take your money?" &mdash;"No; the poor are his trea&s;urers: he always &s;ends &s;ome worthy per&s;on to receive the debt; and you are, at pre&s;ent, the pur&s;e-bearer." Saying this, he pulled out his pur&s;e; and, reckoning fifty guineas, put them into his Grace's hand, and re|tired, &s;aying he &s;hould play no more that day.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="232">The prelate was quite fa&s;cinated; he did not know what to make of this extraordinary adventure: he viewed the money; found all the guineas good; recalled what had pa&s;&s;ed; and be|gan to think there mu&s;t be &s;omething more in this man than he had di&s;covered. However, he continued his j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urney, and applied the money to the u&s;e of the poor, as had been di|rected.</P>
<P>On his return, he &s;topped at the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me inn; and, perceiving the &s;ame per&s;on again in the wood, in his former &s;ituation, he re&s;olved to have a little farther conver&s;ation with him; and went alone to the &s;pot where he was. The &s;tranger was a comely man; and the prelate could not help viewing him with a kind of religious veneration: thinking, by this time, that he was in&s;pired to do good in this uncommon manner. The prelate acco&s;ted him as an old acquaintance, and familiarly a&s;ked him how the chance had &s;tood &s;ince they had fir&s;t met. "Sometimes for me, and &s;ometimes again&s;t me; I have both lo&s;t and won."&mdash;"And are you at play now?"&mdash;"Yes, Sir; we have played &s;everal games to-day."&mdash;"And who wins?" &mdash;"Why, Sir, at pre&s;ent, the advantage is on my &s;ide; the game is ju&s;t over; I have a &s;ine &s;troke; check mate, there it is."&mdash;"And pray, Sir, how much have you won?"&mdash;"Five hundred guineas."&mdash;"That is a hand&s;ome &s;um; but how are you to be paid?"&mdash;"I pay and receive in the like manner: he always &s;ends me &s;ome good rich man when I win; and you, my Lord, are the per&s;on. God is remarkably punctual on the&s;e occa&s;ions."</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop had received a con&s;iderable &s;um that very day; the &s;tranger knew it; and, producing a pi&s;tol, by way of receipt, the prelate found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of giving up his ca&s;h, and by this time di&s;covered the divine in&s;pired game&s;ter to be nothing more or le&s;s than a thief.

One Sunday, in particular, being engaged in the afternoon to play &s;everal airs on the Welch harp, on which in&s;trument, as well as the violin, he was an excellent performer, he delivered the following incomparable &s;ermon to his different pari&s;hioners; which, for brevity, method, point, and moral, we recommend to the attentive peru&s;al of every &s;in|cere chri&s;tian throughout his Maje&s;ty's dominions.</P>

<L>THERE liv'd, as Fame reports, in days of yore,</L>
<L>At lea&s;t &s;ome fifty years ago, or more,</L>
<L>A plea&s;ant wight on town yclep'd Tom King;</L>
<L>A fellow that was clever at a joke;</L>
<L>Expert in all the arts to teaze and <HI>&s;moke;</HI></L>
<L>In &s;hort, for &s;trokes of humour, quite <HI>the thing.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To many a jovial club this King was known,</L>
<L>With whom his active wit unrivall'd &s;hone&mdash;</L>
<L>Choice Spirit, grave Free Ma&s;on, Buck, and Blood,</L>
<L>Would croud his &s;tories and <HI>Bon Mots</HI> to hear;</L>
<L>And none a di&s;appointment e'er could fear,</L>
<L>His humour flow'd in &s;uch a copious flood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To him a frolick was a high delight&mdash;</L>
<L>A frolick he would hunt for day and night,</L>
<L>Carele&s;s how Prudence on the &s;port might frown;</L>
<L>If e'er a plea&s;ant mi&s;chief &s;prang to view,</L>
<L>At once o'er hedge and ditch away he flew;</L>
<L>Nor left the game till he had run it down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One night, our hero, rambling with a friend,</L>
<L>Near fam'd St. Giles's chanc'd his cour&s;e to bend,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t by that &s;pot the Seven Dials hight:</L>
<L>'Twas &s;ilence all around, and clear the coa&s;t;</L>
<L>The watch, as u&s;ual, dozing on his po&s;t;</L>
<L>And &s;carce a lamp di&s;play'd a twinkling light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Around this place there liv'd the num'rous clans</L>
<L>Of hone&s;t, plodding, foreign Artizans,</L>
<L>Known at that time by name of Refugees&mdash;</L>
<L>The rod of Per&s;ecution from their home</L>
<L>Compell'd the inoffen&s;ive race to roam;</L>
<L>And here they lighted, like a &s;warm of bees.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well! our two friends were &s;aunt'ing through the &s;treet,</L>
<L>In hopes &s;ome food for humour &s;oon to meet:</L>
<L>When, in a window near, a light they view;</L>
<L>And, though a dim and melancholy ray,</L>
<L>It &s;eem'd the prologue to &s;ome merry play;</L>
<L>So tow'rds the gloomy dome our hero-drew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="210" REF="236">
<L>Straight at the door he gave a thund'ring knock&mdash;</L>
<L>The time, we may &s;uppo&s;e, near two o'clock.</L>
<L>"I'll a&s;k," &s;ays King, "if Thom&s;on lodges here."</L>
<L>"Thom&s;on!" cries t'other, "who the devil's ne?"&mdash;</L>
<L>"I know not," King replies; "but want to &s;ee</L>

<L>After &s;ome time, a little Frenchman came&mdash;</L>
<L>One hand di&s;play'd a ru&s;hlight's trembling flame,</L>
<L>The other held the thing they call <HI>culotte;</HI></L>
<L>An old &s;trip'd woollen night-cap grac'd his head,</L>
<L>A tatter'd wai&s;tcoat o'er one &s;houlder &s;pread&mdash;</L>
<L>Scarce half awake, he heav'd a yawning note.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Though thus untimely rouz'd, he courteous &s;mil'd;</L>
<L>And &s;oon addre&s;s'd our wag in accents mild,</L>
<L>Bending his head politely to his knee&mdash;</L>
<L>"Pray, Sare, vat vant you, dat you come &s;o late?</L>
<L>I beg your pardon, Sare, to make you vait:</L>
<L>Pray, tell me, Sare, vat your commands vid me?"</L>

<L>"Sir," replied King, "I merely thought to know,</L>

<L>But, really, I di&s;turb'd your &s;leep, I fear&mdash;</L>

<L>Our wag begg'd pardon, and tow'rds home he &s;ped,</L>
<L>While the poor Frenchman crawl'd again to bed:</L>
<L>But King re&s;olv'd, not thus to drop the je&s;t;</L>
<L>So the next night, with more of whim than grace,</L>
<L>Again he made a vi&s;it to the place,</L>
<L>To break once more the poor old Frenchman's re&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He knock'd&mdash;but waited longer than before;</L>
<L>No foot&s;tep &s;eem'd approaching to the door:</L>
<L>Our Frenchman lay in &s;uch a &s;leep profound.</L>
<L>King, with the knocker, thunder'd then again,</L>
<L>Firm on his po&s;t determin'd to remain;</L>

<P>HITHERTO, &s;ince the fir&s;t Print, we have not &s;een the two Apprentices together. Their pur&s;uits widely varied, and they have been alternately pre&s;ented with a mo&s;t forcible contra&s;t to each other. The intere&s;t is wonderfully heightened, on this melancholy interview. The victim of Vice, originating in idlene&s;s, a trembling culprit at the bar of Ju&s;tice; while his fellow-apprentice, as the reward of indu&s;try and virtue, having attained to the dignity of Alderman of London, is con&s;equently a Magi&s;trate, and has the &s;evere but nece&s;&s;ary duty to perform, of committing for trial the companion of his early days, who is impeached of robbery and murder by the profligate one-eyed a&s;&s;ociate with whom he commenced acquaintance, by gambling on a tomb&s;tone during divine &s;ervice. This wretch, who has turned evidence, is &s;wearing with the utmo&s;t audacity and un|concern, to criminate his accomplice; yet contrives, at the &s;ame time, to do what the vulgar denominate <HI>"cheating the devil,"</HI> by taking the book with his left-hand. This impo&s;ition the priggi&s;h admini&s;terer of the oath, with a pen &s;tuck behind his ear, is prevented from regarding by the application of a piece of money placed in the dexter palm, which he holds &s;lily behind for that purpo&s;e.

<P>The attitude of the worthy Alderman, while the Mittimus is making out by his Clerk, which is to place his late fellow-apprentice under the care of the Keeper of Newgate, is a noble di&s;play of dignified &s;uffering.

<HEAD>THE ART OF KICKING.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I took on me the province of a publick writer, I was re&s;olved, to the be&s;t of my poor capacity, to make my works entertaining as well as in&s;tructive to my readers; in order to which, I judged it would be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary not to dwell too long on the &s;ubject. Man, as well as woman, delights in variety; and the mind, as well as the palate, mu&s;t have change of diet. The <HI>"quicquid agunt homines,"</HI> is, in|deed, a large field for wit and &s;atire to exerci&s;e them&s;elves on; but often, of late, when I had cho&s;en my &s;ubject, and &s;at down with a de&s;ign of communicating my thoughts on it, I found, on recollection, that I had been anticipated by &s;ome other au|thors who had lived before me.</P>
<P>The Spectator, of moral and facetious memory, reformed the periwigs, the canes, and the &s;word-knots, of the fops; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, he tripped up their red heels, if I may be allowed that expre&s;|&s;ion. As to the fair-&s;ex, he handled them from head to foot; not a part about a fine lady was left untouched. In a word, whenever I take up the Spectator, I am ready every minute to break out into the &s;ame exclamation that a poet of Ga&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oigny uttered on reading over a beautiful ode of Horace. "<HI>D</HI>&mdash;n
<PB N="219" REF="248">the&s;e ancients!" &s;ays he, "they have &s;tolen all my fine thoughts!"</P>
<P>Writers of &s;uch univer&s;al talents may draw &s;omething that is u&s;eful and entertaining from the mo&s;t barren &s;ubject in na|ture. The Spectator, before-mentioned, has been very learned on dancing. We have had writers, of but a &s;econd or third cla&s;s in fame, who have had their excellence: a Baronet of North Britain has publi&s;hed a large quarto on the Art of Fencing; and a Baronet of Worce&s;ter&s;hire has obliged the world with a treati&s;e of immen&s;e erudition on the Gymna&s;tick Science, or the Art of Wre&s;tling.</P>
<P>But no people come up to the Germans in their indefatigable indu&s;try for &s;earching antiquity. What immen&s;e volumes of ancient learning have they re&s;cued from the cobwebs and ob|livion! How have they worked through the ru&s;t, of time, to make di&s;coveries for the improvement of mankind! And with what infinite labour have they collected the valuable fragments &s;cattered in different authors, on &s;ubjects of high importance to the learned world!</P>
<P>I have my&s;elf &s;een a hi&s;tory written by one of the German literati, entitled&mdash;"De Veterum Lucernis et Candelabris&mdash;Of the Lamps and Candle&s;ticks of the Ancients." It is certain, we &s;hould be groping in the dark in &s;earch of many things be|longing to antiquity, had they not held lights to us. Another, who was as bright a genius as the former, was twenty years in compiling a treati&s;e&mdash;"De Chirothecis et Ocreis&mdash;On Gloves and Boots."</P>
<P>I have been credibly informed by travellers, that there is a large folio manu&s;cript in the Elector Palatine's library&mdash;"De Mi&s;eriis Ambulantium&mdash;On the Mi&s;ery of Walking on Foot;" in which there is a phy&s;ical di&s;&s;ertation on Corns. There are &s;everal volumes&mdash;"De Veterum Cultellis et Furcis&mdash;Of the Knives and Forks of the Ancients," written by one Vander|hackle, enriched with cuts; an art that has contributed very much to illu&s;trate German wit. What need I mention the great Bamboozlebergius, who has made a collection&mdash;"De Mendaciis Antiquorum&mdash;Of the Lies of the Ancients?" which work, we hear, is &s;hortly to be printed in Engli&s;h, for the im|provement and edification of the youth of this kingdom, a cer|tain great man having taken upon him to patronize it; &s;o that I hope every per&s;on in employment will be obliged to &s;ub&s;cribe, under pain of being ca&s;hiered.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e been informed, that there has been for &s;everal years, in the publick library at Rati&s;bon, a mo&s;t curious ma|nu&s;cript&mdash;"De Colophis et Caleationibus Veterum&mdash;Of the Kicks and Cuffs of the Ancients," written by the learned
<PB N="220" REF="249">Vanhoofius; and that a copy of this work was &s;ome years ago tran&s;mitted into England, to be laid up in the Royal Library of St. James's: that it was carefully revi&s;ed and collated by the late learned Doctor Bentley, who has amended an error in the title; for he has proved, that the &s;ub&s;tantive Colophis mu&s;t have been an interpolation of the tran&s;criber; and, of con&s;e|quence, the true reading is&mdash;"De Calcationibus Veterum;" which he tran&s;lates thus&mdash;"Of the Kicks on the Ar&s;e of the Ancients." This &s;hews how learning mu&s;t have &s;uffered through the ignorance of tran&s;cribers, were it not for the ac|curacy of &s;uch judicious criticks.</P>
<P>To confe&s;s the plain truth, I had a de&s;ign of writing &s;ome|thing on this &s;ubject my&s;elf; and have already been at no &s;mall pains in looking over the Cotton and Bodleian libraries. I do not know but it will be very well worth while to take a jour|ney to Rome, on purpo&s;e to con&s;ult that of the Vatican: but I am a little too much confined at pre&s;ent; I therefore beg the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the learned of both our univer&s;ities, and I hope they will be &s;o good as to communicate whatever di&s;coveries they may have made on this &s;ubject in the cour&s;e of their read|ing; and, as I &s;hould be glad to enrich this work with the choice&s;t flowers of antiquity, I intend to publi&s;h them here. It is a &s;ubject, if well handled, that mu&s;t give great &s;atisfaction to the curious; nay, I could wi&s;h the world was but well in|formed of &s;ome late truths concerning Kicking: I fancy it would contribute towards curing the &s;pleen of the whole na|tion.</P>
<P>The &s;tage is the repre&s;entation of the world; and, certainly, a man may know the humours and inclinations of the people by what is liked or di&s;liked on the &s;tage; and I have often ob|&s;erved a Kicking to be the mo&s;t diverting &s;cene in a modern comedy. We have had &s;everal poets of our own nation who have &s;ucceeded very well this way. There is a Kicking be|twixt Sir Harry Wildair and Alderman Smuggler, in the comedy called the Trip to the Jubilee; which is allowed by the able&s;t criticks to be a ma&s;ter-piece of good writing: there is al&s;o a Kicking in the old Old Batchelor, and another in the Squire of Al&s;atia, which are excellently well penned.</P>
<P>Hitherto, indeed, the&s;e Kickings have been only the &s;upport and ornament of the comick &s;cene: I wi&s;h, with all my heart, &s;ome poet of a &s;ublime genius would venture to write a Kick|ing in a tragedy. I am well per&s;uaded, if an author were to introduce a king Kicking the fir&s;t-mini&s;ter, it would have a very good effect: &s;uch an incident mu&s;t certainly give great plea&s;ure to the audience, and contribute very much to the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the play.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="250">But, to come nearer to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e: I have taken no &s;mall pains in examining authors, to find out when this cu&s;tom of Kicking fir&s;t began in the world. I am &s;orry that the writers of hi&s;tory have not been a little more particular in a matter of &s;o great importance to mankind.</P>
<P>Some of the Roman Emperors&mdash;&s;uch as Nero, Domitian, and Caligula&mdash;were given to Kicking: &s;o, indeed, was our Harry the Eighth; he made nothing of Kicking the Hou&s;e of Commons. There is a box on the ear recorded of Queen Elizabeth: it was a &s;udden &s;ally of jealous love; it was but a kind of <HI>aigre douceur;</HI> and it does not appear that it was the fa&s;hion of her court. The action of Kicking might be thought a little too robu&s;t for the delicacy of her &s;ex; it might have ex|po&s;ed the royal legs, <HI>et coetera,</HI> to the &s;neers of the young fel|lows of the court; therefore, &s;he mode&s;tly turned it into a box on the ear.</P>
<P>As no man can account how fa&s;hions ri&s;e and fall, who knows but the practice of Kicking on every trifling occa&s;ion may be|come a fa&s;hion in this kingdom? One of the greate&s;t wits of our nation has placed the &s;eat of honour in a certain part of the body that I do not well know how to de&s;cribe. It is the part which we mu&s;t not name in well-bred company; yet happy is the fair maid who &s;hall ri&s;e with that part uppermo&s;t in a morn|ing; good luck &s;hall attend her; her lover &s;hall be kind, and all the wi&s;hes of that day &s;hall be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s: but, if I mu&s;t de&s;cribe it &s;till plainer, it is the part where &s;chool|boys are puni&s;hed for fal&s;e concords, and for playing truant. If it &s;hould, I &s;ay, become a fa&s;hion, you would &s;ee a fellow at court, who had ju&s;t received a mo&s;t gracious Kick on that part, return as proud as a citizen from being knighted: and why may not the honour of knighthood be conferred this way, as well as by the &s;word? And, indeed, why might not all titles be conferred this way?</P>
<P>Again, if you &s;hould happen to &s;ee a crowd of &s;laves runn|ing to the levee of &s;ome court favourite in a morning, and any body &s;hould a&s;k, how comes this man to be &s;o courted, or &s;o followed; the natural an&s;wer in this ca&s;e would be&mdash;"He has been lately Kicked into preferment."</P>
<P>It might be turned to excellent u&s;e towards carrying on the de&s;igns of mini&s;ters of &s;tate, in ca&s;e they &s;hould happen to be pur&s;uing mea&s;ures apparently de&s;tructive to the liberties of their country; for, in this ca&s;e, they mu&s;t, for their own &s;afety, be obliged to bribe the repre&s;entatives of the people; and, as they would certainly bribe with the people's money, not with their own, and as I &s;hould think it a very right thing to &s;ave the publick money, I &s;hould for that rea&s;on humbly propo&s;e, that
<PB N="222" REF="251">Kicking might be introduced into publick bu&s;ine&s;s, in&s;tead of bribing. I do not doubt that it might an&s;wer the &s;ame pur|po&s;es; for I am firmly of opinion, that whoever will take a bribe, will take a Kicking.</P>
<P>I believe, &s;ome examples may be brought where it has been made u&s;e of with &s;ucce&s;s: men, I &s;ay, have been Kicked as well as bribed into mea&s;ures again&s;t their country; and, there|fore, it is not at all improbable but it may, &s;ome time or other, become a method of carrying on &s;tate-affairs. If we &s;hould live to &s;ee that day, young princes, in&s;tead of riding, fencing, and dancing, would have proper ma&s;ters provided to in&s;truct them in Kicking; and, as he that undertook to eat a &s;word began by eating a dagger, &s;o a young adept &s;hould begin by Kicking his hat, before he was put to Kick a man.</P>
<P>As to the young nobility and gentry, in&s;tead of wa&s;ting their youth in &s;tudying to under&s;tand Horace and Virgil, they might be in&s;tructed to take a Kicking with a good grace; by which means you would &s;ee a polite nobility, a valiant gentry, a mo&s;t pious dignified clergy, and a court that would be a con&s;tellation of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious per&s;onages of the kingdom.</P>
<P>There is a court of honour in all the countries of Europe. In France, the mare&s;chals or generals pre&s;ide in it. In Eng|land, the judge of the court of honour is hereditary in the fa|mily of the fir&s;t duke of the kingdom. I &s;hould think that the ceremonial of Kicking a man into a title, or a great employ|ment, might be &s;ettled by the judges of the&s;e courts of honour. If I might be worthy of advi&s;ing in matters of &s;o high a nature, I &s;hould think it would be too great a fatigue for the prince him&s;elf to Kick the whole court, e&s;pecially in countries where the court is numerous. I am therefore of opinion, that no|body &s;hould have the honour of being Kicked by the &s;overeign, except the fir&s;t mini&s;ter, the principal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, the pre&s;ident of his councils, and &s;ome few others the great officers of the crown; but the&s;e might Kick tho&s;e next in employment under them, who might Kick the next; and &s;o it might gra|dually de&s;cend, till there &s;hould not be a man in any employ|ment in the kingdom but what might be Kicked.</P>
<P>It is not yet, indeed, become a cu&s;tom in any part of Eu|rope; the more is the pity! for I think it would be a truly royal exerci&s;e for a prince to divert him&s;elf with Kicking two or three of his mini&s;ters every morning: it would contribute to the pre&s;ervation of his own health, as well as to mending the manners of his court; and I believe it would have become a fa&s;hion &s;ome where or other, were it not that the young no|bility of all nations travel to France, and are apt to retain im|pre&s;&s;ions of what they &s;ee there. The barbarity of a French
<PB N="223" REF="252">education will not &s;uffer a gentleman to take a Kick from any per&s;on, be he ever &s;o great, without &s;ome terrible con&s;e|quences: but I hope that, in this nation, we may live to get the better of tho&s;e prejudices; which may have this good con|&s;equence, it may introduce an elegance and politene&s;s of man|ners not known in the world, except among the ancient Goths and modern Hottentots.</P>
<P>I may &s;ay, without vanity, that we are not &s;uch barbarians, but there may be found among us &s;ome great men who can pocket up a Kick or a cuff with as good an air as they could a bribe; and as to tho&s;e &s;plendid agitations of choler, which are apt to break out into "Rogue!" and "Ra&s;cal!" I am cre|dibly informed, &s;ome very &s;tately per&s;ons are &s;o u&s;ed to them, that they receive them with the &s;ame countenance as&mdash;"Sir, I ki&s;s your hands!" This &s;hews we are well di&s;po&s;ed for a re|formation of manners; yet I fear it will not grow into general imitation, unle&s;s the court &s;hould &s;et the example, which I am afraid will not happen: but if we &s;hould live to &s;ee that day, the placemen mu&s;t of cour&s;e all fall into it; and I think it would be plea&s;ant enough, when a great employment became vacant, to &s;ee a parcel of impudent fellows, in lace and embroi|dery, pre&s;&s;ing and elbowing to be Kicked.</P>
<P>If the common people, who are not fond of new fa&s;hions at their fir&s;t ri&s;e, &s;hould di&s;cover any di&s;like of coming into it, why might not a Standing Army be employed to Kick the whole nation?</P>

<P>SETTING a&s;ide all hou&s;hold work, which I do very well if I plea&s;e, I can tell lyes of my ma&s;ter and mi&s;tru&s;s; and, when I am &s;ent of an arrand, let it be for what it will in the grocery way, allways go to the chandler's-&s;hop; where the good old woman that keeps it, commonly keeps a dram of that that's good, and is as eager to know the &s;ecrets of the family as I am to tell them.</P>
<P>Secondly. I can take a lump of fre&s;h-butter&mdash;if it is not quite &s;o good for a &s;arvant's &s;tomach as it &s;hould be&mdash;and flounce it into the grea&s;e-tubb&mdash;or the in&s;ide &s;at of a &s;urloin of beef&mdash;with as much dexterity as any girl in the kingdom, tho&s;e an I &s;ay it; where many other &s;arvants, to their &s;hame be it &s;poken, would give it away to a dog, or a poor par&s;on; which, I think, is no &s;ign of their &s;avingne&s;s; becau&s;e, if they rightly con&s;ider, the revenues of the grea&s;e-tubb, when properly ma|naged,
<PB N="224" REF="253">would bring them three of four good gownds to their backs in a year.</P>
<P>Thirdly. I am very quick of hearing when nobody calls; and if any body does, e&s;pecially my ma&s;ter or mi&s;trus, I am &s;o deaf I cannot hear them, till they have almo&s;t tore their winpipes with calling. This is a &s;overign vartue in a &s;arvant; for, when a ma&s;ter or mi&s;trus thinks a &s;arvant's deaf, they are apt to talk about their &s;ecrets with le&s;s &s;u&s;picion; and, &s;ometimes, they may call one another Dog and Bitch, upon the pre&s;umption that the &s;arvant cannot hear them.</P>
<P>Fourthly. When there is any rea&s;on to imagine my mi&s;trus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> going to have a new gownd, I can tell her &s;uch a &s;tory, that I a'n't in the lea&s;t afeard of getting the old one for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Fifthly. If my ma&s;ter &s;hould come home late, and in liquor, I can help him up to bed: and, in ca&s;e my mi&s;trus is out of town, &s;uppo&s;ing he &s;hould be incapable of undre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, I can pull off his cloaths; and, if required, can go to bed to him as well as my mi&s;trus.</P>
<P>Sixthly. If my mi&s;trus &s;hould be a breeding woman, and apt to lye-inn during the time, I can &s;ide with the nur&s;e, and make as much wa&s;te as her&s;elf; play up old goo&s;eberry with the pots and &s;aucepans; and nock the pewter and bra&s;&s;es about with as much con&s;ideration, as if they co&s;t nothing at all.</P>
<P>Seventhly. During her lying-inn, I can trump up a &s;tory about my ma&s;ter's going to lewd women. This, you know, may have it's effect; for, if a mi&s;trus takes on in &s;uch a &s;ituation, and frets much about it, who knows but &s;he may die? and then I &s;tand a chance to marry my ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Eighthly. If there is a cru&s;t of bread harder than ordinary, I always carry it to my ma&s;ter's table; for ma&s;ters and mi&s;tru&s;&s;es may eat it, becau&s;e they know their &s;arvants won't.</P>
<P>Ninthly. If there is any kind of greens for dinner&mdash;as there commonly is&mdash;I always take care to &s;end the out&s;ide leaves to ma&s;ter's table, and detach the be&s;t part in a cullender, over &s;ome hot water, till they have done: for why &s;hould not &s;arvants know what's good as well as their ma&s;ters and mi&s;tru&s;&s;es?</P>

When a man lives, as I did, unmarried till he is &s;ixty-one, he had better never marry at all. There are more ways by which a woman may torment her hu&s;band be&s;ides being jealous of him. To give you &s;ome idea of my &s;ituation, take the general outlines of my hi&s;tory. The earlie&s;t part of my life I &s;pent at college in the &s;tudy of phy&s;ick; and, I don't know why, acquired the character of an odd learned fellow. When I arrived at the age of forty, a vacancy happened in the neighbourhood of my birth, and I was invited by my uncle to take upon me the infirmities of all the folks within the circle of twenty miles. Before I &s;et out, I ordered the college-barber to make me what the wags called a Lion, or a Pomp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y; literally, nothing more than a good phy&s;ical wig; under the &s;hadow of which, by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a hand&s;ome cane, properly applied to the immoveable mu&s;cles of my face, and a few very &s;ignificant &s;hrugs and &s;olemn nods, I &s;oon acquired the reputation of an eminent phy&s;ician. Fees came in apace; &s;o that, in the cour&s;e of twenty years, I had &s;aved up more money than I really knew what to do with. Whether it was my learning, my per&s;on, or my money, I can't &s;ay; but a lady of the neighbourhood took a va&s;t liking to &s;omething belonging to me. I was not &s;o blind but I &s;aw the conque&s;t; for &s;he would often come and &s;pend a week to|gether with me: in &s;hort, I married her&mdash;I was pa&s;t the years of di&s;cretion, and &s;o I married her. O what a conde&s;cen&s;ion! A lady of her rank, family, and fa&s;hion in life! As for age, indeed, &s;he was but &s;ix years younger than my&s;elf; and for for|tune, if &s;he ever had any, &s;he had &s;pent it; and yet I was &s;uch a fool, as to be convinced &s;he was conferring the greate&s;t obli|gation in the world upon me.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e take upon her the management of my fa|mily, than adieu for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver to all order, peace, and comfort. She began with di&s;charging poor Jonas, becau&s;e he made &s;o queer a figure in a long qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> and white &s;tockings, which &s;he in|&s;i&s;ted upon his wearing, though the poor follow could not but laugh at him&s;elf. The &s;ame day, with Jonas, my old wig was di&s;carded: it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed it rather grew the wor&s;e for wear. From long acquaintance, it had contracted &s;uch a con|nection and familiarity, that it no longer kept that re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">al di&s;tance from each &s;ide of my face which had at fir&s;t &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;ned it; I had, however, &s;till contiued it in &s;er|vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. purely from this reflection, that the older it grew, the lo&s;s
<PB N="226" REF="255">occa&s;ion it had for combing. A new wig has been immedi|ately put on the &s;hocks, with a feathered top and forked tail; &s;ince the arrival of which, I am never &s;uffered to &s;tir out, let the occa&s;ion be ever &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, before it is combed and pow|dered. Our prig of a new footman is &s;o long in twi&s;ting, and turning, and tickling it up, that a &s;core of patients have ex|pired, and the fees have been lo&s;t, ere I was able to &s;et out to re|lieve them</P>
<P>My &s;nuff-coloured &s;uit had been rein&s;tated every other year from a pattern that was left in the hands of an hone&s;t taylor on the neighbouring heath. He, poor fellow, was likewi&s;e forbid the hou&s;e; becau&s;e, according to my directions, he made my cloaths ea&s;y. A more fa&s;hionable operator was charged with preparing a new &s;uit with gold button-holes: he made them to &s;it &s;o exactly, that I dare not bring my hands to meet before me, for fear of laying open my &s;pinal bone.</P>
<P>My hat is not to be &s;lapped any more, even though the &s;un &s;hine full in my face.</P>
<P>I am no longer &s;uffered to wa&s;h my face, according to cu&s;tom, every morning, at the pump in my back-yard, though nothing was more refre&s;hing; nor any thing more handy than the towel, which revolved on a roller at the back of the kitchen|door.</P>
<P>On my return home the other day from vi&s;iting a patient, I found the maid had &s;et my &s;tudy to rights, as &s;he called it; but the con&s;u&s;ion which the regularity has occa&s;ioned is almo&s;t in|conceivable. My toe-pin, my &s;hoeing-horn, and tobacco-&s;topper, are lo&s;t for ever; my papers are di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch or|der, that I know not where to recur to any thing I want</P>
<P>Two pair of old Manche&s;ter velvet breeches, which I left on the back of a chair, have di&s;appeared; and in&s;tead of the ea&s;y &s;lippers which I had made out of an old pair of &s;hoes, by cutting the &s;traps off, I found a new pair of red leather, adorned with white &s;titches round the edges, and made &s;o neat that, I can't bear to walk in them</P>
<P>My woollen night-cap is condemned, in company with my brown ho&s;e, to the vile purpo&s;e of rubbing the grates and &s;enders; and my wife in&s;i&s;ts that I wear one of linen, flounced on all &s;ides, adorned with a black ribband which, tying toge|ther the aperture within an inch and a half of the top, care|le&s;sly &s;lows down on the &s;ide. I took &s;uch a violent cold the fir&s;t night, that it brought a defluxion of humours into my right eye, which very nearly deprived me of &s;ight</P>
<P>The &s;tair-ca&s;e and floors are all waxed: it &s;aves the expence of mops, indeed; but I have &s;uch falls, that I have almo&s;t di&s;lo|cated every joint about me.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="256">My neck is &s;tretched out in &s;uch a manner, that I am appre|hen&s;ive of having my throat out with the pa&s;teboard.</P>
<P>When I remon&s;trate on any of tho&s;e articles, &s;he &s;tops my mouth by a ki&s;s, and &s;ays&mdash;"My dear angel! we mu&s;t have &s;ome little regard to appearances."</P>
<P>She is, as I told you, but &s;ix years younger than my&s;elf; yet &s;he dre&s;&s;es, dances, and drives about, as if &s;he was but five-and-twenty.</P>
<P>This, however, and much more, I could bear; I de&s;erve it: I am contented &s;he &s;hall con&s;ume &s;ix-and-thirty yards more than my old maid He&s;ter in the &s;pinning of her gown; &s;he may play a &s;hilling a fi&s;h at quadrille; &s;he may do&mdash;aye, &s;he may do what &s;he plea&s;es, let me have but my &s;tudy to my&s;elf; let my night-cap and &s;lippers he re&s;tored, and I will &s;ubmit to wear the new coat and the wig every Sunday.</P>
<P>P. S. I long to take poor Jonas again: he u&s;ed always to ride before me; and, drunk or &s;ober, he knew the &s;horte&s;t way all over the country. What &s;ignifies whether one's foot|man wears a wig or his own hair? 'Tis true, he never blacked either my boots or his own.</P>

<P>AS you are now tenant at will in a very hand&s;ome HOUSE, are capable of furni&s;hing it in the polite&s;t manner, and of ruling it by the &s;tricte&s;t maxims of oeconomy and decorum, permit a friend to give a few cur&s;ory hints, in an affair of &s;o much importance.</P>
<P>The Building, as you mu&s;t be convinced, is compo&s;ed of &s;ome of the fine&s;t materials that were ever beheld; and is of cour&s;e extremely liable to di&s;cover every &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and &s;pot that may affect it.

<P>On the top &s;tands an eminent Turret, furni&s;hed with a Room of a globular form; which, I ob&s;erve, has two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y&s;ial Windows in the front. The&s;e are &s;o con&s;tructed, and to be ex|ceedingly u&s;eful: they command an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect; and if always kept clean and bright, will prove a very great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to your Hou&s;e.

<PB N="228" REF="257">by a proper centinel, and by no means &s;uffered to &s;tand open; as you will otherwi&s;e be perpetually crouded with Vi&s;itors, and perhaps with many di&s;agreable ones. However, let the&s;e u&s;eful Portals never be &s;hut again&s;t the advi&s;ing Friend, the in&s;tructing Parent, or the &s;upplicating Orphan. There is a &s;ingle Gate in the front, by which all your company is di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, and this &s;hould in general be barred clo&s;e: it, is, indeed, &s;o very publick, that you can hardly let out any Vi&s;itor pri|vately; and you mu&s;t be very careful that no &s;u&s;picious cha|racter be &s;een to quit it, le&s;t you draw a &s;candal on your Hou&s;e. Whatever Company, therefore, may have forced their way into the Side-Portals, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to lay the &s;trict|e&s;t injunctions of vigilance on the Two able Porters, who &s;tand con&s;tantly before the ivory Palli&s;adoes, in a livery of the deepe&s;t &s;carlet. I have &s;een &s;ome Ladies paint the Two Pan|nels, ju&s;t below the Windows of their Hou&s;es; but I advi&s;e you to avoid that cu&s;tom, as the natural colours far exceed every decoration of art.</P>
<P>This part of the Edifice is &s;upported by a Pillar of Corinthian Marble, the ba&s;e of which is ornamented with a pair of Ala|ba&s;ter Semi-Globes; and over the&s;e it will be very proper to draw a fine lawn curtain.</P>
<P>Beneath the&s;e is the Great Hall, in which you have a &s;mall Clo&s;et of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip: this, I &s;uppo&s;e, is the place of your &s;ecret retirement, open to none but your&s;elf, and &s;ome approved friends: I advi&s;e you to keep this always clean; to furni&s;h it well; to make it a little library of the be&s;t practical authors; and to vi&s;it it frequently, e&s;pecially when you return from church, or leave a circle of acquaintance whom you have met at the tea-table.</P>
<P>Let the out&s;ide of your Hall not appear like a hor&s;e hung round with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;eutcheons, nor be like a coach of &s;tate da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bed over with tin&s;el and colourings; but let it be plain and near, to convince the world that it is kept more for u&s;e than or|nament.</P>
<P>You are &s;en&s;ible, Mi&s;s, that Time effaces the beauty, and demoli&s;hes the &s;trength, of the noble&s;t &s;tructures; and, there|fore, do not be alarmed on finding yours &s;ubject to the like change. Doubtle&s;s, it has often wanted repairs, though you have lived in it no longer; which is a plain intimation that the Hou&s;e mu&s;t in a few years fall. You may, indeed, &s;oon be turned out; the Landlord may give you warning, or he may not; and, as all this is quite uncertain, be perpetually pre|pared, and then you need never be afraid of quitting it.</P>
<P>One thing I mu&s;t not forget to ob&s;erve: when you have once left your Hou&s;e, no other human being will ever inhabit
<PB N="229" REF="258">it, but it will be wa&s;te and in ruins; yet the Proprietor has pro|mi&s;ed &s;ome time or other to rebuild it, for your reception, in a more durable manner. But though it will then be con&s;tructed with the &s;ame materials, they are to be &s;o refined and modified by the Great Architect, that the edifice will not be in future liable to any accident or decay; and, as it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary that your Habitation be reared in &s;ome other place, I hear|tily wi&s;h it may be &s;ituated in a finer country, under a milder climate, and on a &s;pot not expo&s;ed to tho&s;e pitile&s;s &s;torms, which injure, and too often de&s;troy, the be&s;t contrived Build|ings in this &s;ublunary abode&mdash;&s;ince you mu&s;t then take it for a term which will never expire!</P>
