<P>THE School for LOVERS, A COMEDY.</P>
<P>As it is Acted at the THEATRE ROYAL in <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI></P>
<P>By WILLIAM WHITEHEAD, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> POET LAUREAT.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Comedy is formed on a plan of Mon&s;ieur de Fontenelle's, never intended for the &s;tage, and printed in the eighth volume of his works, under the title of Le Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>The &s;cene of that piece is laid in Greece, and the embarra&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances depend on &s;ome peculiarities in the cu&s;toms of that coun|try. Slaves likewi&s;e, as is u&s;ual in the Grecian Comedy, act as confidantes to the principal per&s;onages. The Author, therefore, hopes he may be excu&s;ed for having made the &s;tory Engli&s;h, and his own; for having introduced a new character, and endeavoured to heighten tho&s;e he found already &s;ketched out. The delicacy of the &s;entiments in Philonoe and Eudamidas, he has inviolably adhered to, wherever he could in&s;ert them properly, in his Caelia and Sir John Dorilant; and would willingly flatter him&s;elf, that he has made great and not contemptible additions to their characters, as well as to the others.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who will give them&s;elves the trouble to read both pieces, will &s;ee where the Author is, or is not indebted to that elegant French Writer.</P>

<P>But Sir! what can po&s;&s;ibly have alarmed you thus? You &s;ee me quite unconcerned. I only tell you in a plain &s;imple narrative manner &mdash; (this plaguy thread) &mdash; and merely by way of conver|&s;ation, that you are in love with Caelia; and where is the mighty harm in all this?</P>

<P>Why that <HI>too</HI> is true&mdash;but&mdash;you are in love with Caelia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ble&s;s me, madam, what can I &s;ay to you? If it had not been for my attendance upon you, I had never known Caelia or her mother either, though they are both my relations. The mother has &s;ince indeed put &s;ome kind of confidence in me; &s;he is a widow you know&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And wants con&s;olation! The poor orphan too her daughter! Well, charity is an excellent virtue. I never con&s;idered it in that light before. You are va&s;tly charitable, Mr. Modely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to talk with you.&mdash;If you will not do me ju&s;tice, do it to your&s;elf at lea&s;t. Is there any compari&s;on betwixt you and Caelia? Could any man of &s;en&s;e he&s;itate a moment? She has yet no character. One does not know what &s;he is, or what &s;he will be; a chit, a green girl of fourteen or fifteen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Seventeen at lea&s;t.&mdash;(I cannot undo this knot.)&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let her be &s;eventeen. Would any man of
<PB N="3" REF="10">
judgment attach him&s;elf to a girl of that age? O' my &s;oul, if one was to make love to her, &s;he would hardly under&s;tand what one meant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Girls are not quite &s;o ignorant as you may ima|gine, Mr. Modely; Caelia will under&s;tand you, take my word for it, and does under&s;tand you. As to your men of judgment and &s;en&s;e, here is my brother now; I take him to be full as rea&s;onable as your&s;elf, and &s;omewhat older; and yet with all his philo&s;ophy, he has brought him&s;elf to a de|termination at la&s;t, to fulfill the father's will, and marry this green girl. I am &s;orry to tell you &s;o, Mr. Modely, but he will certainly marry her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let him marry her. I &s;hould perhaps do it my|&s;elf, if I was in his place. He was an intimate friend of her father's. She is a great fortune, and was given to him by will. But do you imagine, my dear Araminta, that if he was left to his own choice, without any bias, he would not rather have a woman nearer his own years? He might al|mo&s;t be her father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true. But you will find it difficult to per&s;uade me, that youth in a woman is &s;o in&s;ur|mountable an objection. I fancy, Mr. Modely, it may be got over. Suppo&s;e I leave you to think of it.&mdash;(I cannot get this right.)&mdash;

<P>Unea&s;y!&mdash;I unea&s;y!&mdash; What does the man mean? I was a little concerned indeed to give you unea&s;ine&s;s by informing you of my brother's in|tended marriage with Caelia. But&mdash;(this &s;huttle bends &s;o abominably.)</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quick eyes indeed! I thought my cunning here had been a ma&s;ter piece. The girl cannot have told &s;ure! and the mother is entirely on my &s;ide. They certainly were tho&s;e inqui&s;itive eyes &s;he &s;peaks of, which have found out this &s;ecret. Well, I mu&s;t be more cautious for the future, and act the lover to Araminta ten times &s;tronger than ever. One would not give her up till one was &s;ure of &s;uc|ceeding in the other place.</P>

<P>You may be ea&s;y on that head. We have the garden to our&s;elves. The widow and her daughter are ju&s;t gone in, and Sir John is bu&s;y with his &s;teward.</P>

<P>On &s;eeing me and Araminta? I hope I have no jealou&s;ies there too. However I am glad Caelia knows I am in the garden, becau&s;e it may probably induce her to fall in my way, by chance you know, and give me an opportunity of talking to her.</P>

<P>That might not be quite &s;o expedient. I think Araminta the fine&s;t woman, and Caelia the prettie&s;t girl I know. Now they are both good fortunes, and one of them I am re&s;olved to have, but which &mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Your great wi&s;dom has not yet determined. Thou art undoubtedly the vaine&s;t fellow living.&mdash; I thought you brought me down here now to your wedding?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Egad I thought &s;o too, but this plaguy little ru&s;tic has di&s;concerted all my &s;chemes. Sir John, you know, by her father's will, may marry her if he plea&s;es, and &s;he forfeits her e&s;tate if &s;he marries any one el&s;e. Now I am contriving to bring it about, that I may get her, and her fortune too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very likely bu&s;ine&s;s, truly. So you mode&s;tly expect that Sir John Dorilant &s;hould give up his mi&s;tre&s;s, and then throw her fortune into the bat|gain, as an additional reward to the obliging man who has &s;educed her from him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="14">
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hum! why I don't expect quite that. But you know, Belmour, he is a man of honour, and would not force her inclinations tho' he loved her to di&s;|traction. &mdash;Come, come, he is quite a different creature from what you and I are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak for your&s;elf, good Sir; yet why &s;hould you imagine that her inclinations are not as likely to fix upon him as you? He has a good per&s;on, and is &s;carce older than your&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That &s;hews your ignorance; I am ten years younger than he is. My dre&s;s and the company I keep, give a youth and vivacity to me, which he mu&s;t always want. An't I a man of the town? O that town, Belmour! Could I but have met the&s;e ladies there, I had done the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were they never there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.&mdash;Sir Harry Beverley, the father of this girl, lived always in the country, and divided his time between his books and his hounds. His wife and daughter &s;eldom mixed with people of their own rank, but at a hor&s;e-race, or a rural vi&s;it. And &s;ee the effects! The girl, tho' &s;he is naturally genteel, has an air of &s;implicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does not want &s;en&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no!&mdash;She has a devili&s;h deal of that kind of &s;en&s;e, which is acquired by early reading. I have heard her talk occa&s;ionally, like a queen in a tragedy, or at lea&s;t like a &s;entimental lady in a comedy,
<PB N="8" REF="15">
much above your mi&s;&s;es of thirty in town, I a&s;&s;ure you.&mdash;As to the mother&mdash;But &s;he is a charac|ter, and explains her&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I have read her. But pray how came it to pa&s;s, that the father, who was of a different way of thinking in regard to party, &s;hould have left Sir John guardian to his daughter, with the addi|tional clau&s;e too, of her being obliged to marry him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is &s;omewhat &s;urprizing. But the truth of the ca&s;e was, they were thoroughly acquainted, and each con&s;idered party as the foible of the other. Sir Harry thought a good hu&s;band his daughter's be&s;t &s;ecurity for happine&s;s, and he knew it was im|po&s;&s;ible Sir John Dorilant &s;hould prove a bad one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet this pro&s;pect of happine&s;s would you de&s;troy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; I only &s;ee farther than Sir Harry did, and would increa&s;e that happine&s;s, by giving her a better hu&s;band.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! your humble &s;ervant, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be&s;ides, the mother is entirely in my intere&s;t, and by the by has a hankering after Sir John her&s;elf. <Q>He is a &s;ober man, and &s;hould have a woman of di&s;cretion for his wife, not a hoydening girl.</Q>&mdash; 'Egad, Belmour, &s;uppo&s;e you attacked the widow?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are va&s;tly kind to Sir John, and would ea&s;e him I find of both his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. But &s;uppo&s;e this man of honour &s;hould be fool enough to re&s;ign his mi&s;tre&s;s, may not another kind of honour oblige him to run you through the body for de&s;erting his &s;i&s;ter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not &s;o very obliging perhaps neither. It would be merely for my own &s;ake, for then would I have the appearance of the mo&s;t obedient &s;ympathetic wife in the univer&s;e, and yet be as de&s;potic in my govern|ment as an ea&s;tern monarch. And when I grew tired, as I probably &s;hould do, of a want of contradiction, why, I &s;hould find an ea&s;y remedy for that too&mdash; I could break your heart in about a month.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't trifle with me, 'tis your &s;erious advice I want; give it me hone&s;tly as a friend, and ten|derly as a &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I have done it, fifty times. What can I &s;ay more? If you will have it again you mu&s;t. This then it is in plain terms.&mdash;But you are &s;ure you are heartily in love with her?</P>

<SP>

<P>Well then, that we will take for granted; and now you want to know what is right and proper for you to do in the ca&s;e. Why, was I in your place, I &s;hould make but &s;hort work with it. She knows the circum&s;tances of her father's will, therefore, would I go immediately to her, tell her how my heart &s;tood inclined, and hope &s;he had no objections to comply, with what it is not in her power to refu&s;e.</P>

<P>You would not have me talk thus abruptly to her?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAMINTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I would. It will &s;ave a world of trouble. She will blu&s;h perhaps at fir&s;t, and look a little aukward, (and by the by &s;o will you too); but if &s;he is the girl I take her for, after a little irre&s;olute ge&s;ture, and about five minutes conver&s;ation, &s;he will drop you a curte&s;y with the demure humility of a Ve&s;tal, and tell you it &s;hall be as you and her mama plea&s;es.</P>

<P>CAELIA in love with me! Egad the thing is not impo&s;&s;ible; my friend Modely may have been a little mi&s;taken. Sir John was very &s;erious when he told me of it; and though I prote&s;ted to him that I had never made the lea&s;t advances, he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his opinion.&mdash;The girl mu&s;t have have told him &s;o her&s;elf.&mdash;Let me recollect a little. &mdash;She is always extremely civil to me; but that indeed &s;he is to every body.&mdash;I do not remember any thing particular in her looks; but I &s;hall watch them more narrowly the next time I &s;ee her.&mdash;She is very hand&s;ome; and yet in my opi|nion, notwith&s;tanding Modely's infidelity, Ara|minta is much the finer woman.&mdash;Suppo&s;e&mdash; No, that will not do.</P>

<P>So, &s;o, Mr. Belmour, I imagined I &s;hould find you here; this is the lover's corner. We have all had our reveries in it. But why don't you talk louder, man? You ought, at lea&s;t, to give me my revenge in that. My &s;oliloquies, you know, are ea&s;ily over-heard.</P>

<SPEAKER>MODELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my honour, no, if we mu&s;t be &s;erious: it may be a mi&s;take, but not intended on my &s;ide, I can a&s;&s;ure you. Come, come, if the girl really likes you, take her. If I &s;hould prove the happy man, give me joy, and there's an end of it.</P>

<P>Your lady&s;hip mu&s;t fir&s;t let me into the &s;ecret. I am ab&s;olutely in a wood with regard to the whole affair. What is all this of Caelia and Belmour?</P>

<P>Nothing, nothing at all; an errant dilemma of the fooli&s;h man's own making, which his imper|tinent &s;i&s;ter will immediately clear up to him, and then all mu&s;t out.</P>

<P>But how came Belmour ever to be mentioned in the ca&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Dear, dear, he never was mentioned. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I was &s;o provoked with Sir John's un|natural behaviour, that I could not help telling him that Caelia had a lover, and in the hou&s;e too. Your &s;ituation with regard to Araminta made him never dream of you, and con&s;equently all his &s;u&s;picions turned on Belmour.</P>

<P>Why, then, madam, to &s;peak with reverence, I &s;hould hope your lady&s;hip would &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping me as concealed as po&s;&s;ible. It is the young lady's pa&s;&s;ion, not mine, which mu&s;t have the principal influence. Sir John Dorilant's pecu|liarity of temper is &s;uch&mdash;</P>

<P>Not in the lea&s;t, madam, I have no blame to ca&s;t upon you for any part of your conduct. Your youth and inexperience, joined to the goodne&s;s of your heart, are &s;ufficient apologies for any &s;hadow of indi&s;cretion which might appear in your behavi|our.

<PB N="59" REF="66">
it is your happine&s;s, not my own, which is the ob|ject of my anxiety.</P>
<P>Your father's will is but too clear in its inten|tions. But the purity of his heart never meant to promote my felicity at the expence of yours.

<P>But I beg pardon; and will only add one cau|tion, which my duty demands of me, as your guardian, your protector, and your father's friend. &mdash;You have been a witne&s;s of Modely's tran&s;acti|ons with my &s;i&s;ter. Have a care therefore, Caelia; be &s;ure of his firm attachment before you let your own hurry you into a compliance.

<P>YOU find, Mr. Belmour, that I have &s;een your partialities, and like a woman of ho|nour I have confe&s;&s;ed my own. Your behaviour to your friend is generous beyond compari&s;on, and I could almo&s;t join in the little &s;tratagem you pro|po&s;e, merely to &s;ee if he de&s;erves it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELMOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, madam, you mi&s;take him utterly. Vanity is his ruling vice; an idle affectation of &s;uc|ce&s;s among the ladies, which makes fools admire, and boys envy him, is the ma&s;ter pa&s;&s;ion of his giddy heart. The &s;evere checks he has met with to-day, have &s;ufficiently opened his under&s;tanding; and the real po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one valuable woman, whom he dreads to lo&s;e, will &s;oon convince him how de|&s;picable his folly has made him.</P>
