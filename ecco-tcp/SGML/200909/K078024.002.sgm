<P>The Papilio Iris is e&s;teemed among the beautiful, and placed with the rare of the <HI>Engli&s;h Lepidoptera.</HI> The cur&s;ory reader may not perceive that &s;uperiority, particularly as many of the minute In&s;ects infinitely excel in real beauty and richne&s;s of colouring; but the &s;cien|tific
<PB N="4" REF="4">
will be ever ready to give it the fir&s;t place as a Briti&s;h Papilio, and to tho&s;e a figure of the Caterpillar and Chry&s;alis will be an ac|ceptable acqui&s;ition. It derives the title of Purple High Flyer, as it very rarely de&s;cends to the ground; except in &s;ome few in&s;tances, it has never been taken but in the mo&s;t elevated &s;ituations, and even tho&s;e in&s;tances have been after a &s;trong wind, or heavy rain: The tops of the loftie&s;t fore&s;t trees afford it an a&s;ylum, and in the Caterpillar and Chry&s;alis &s;tate, it is pre&s;erved from the wanton cruelty of man, by the almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible height of its habitation. They feed on the Sallow, <HI>&s;alix caprea,</HI> and the Caterpillars are obtained by beating the branches of the tree with a pole twenty or thirty feet in length; it is then but a nece&s;&s;ary precaution to cover the ground beneath with large &s;heets to a certain di&s;tance, or the in&s;ects which fall, will be lo&s;t among the herbage.</P>
<P>It is in Caterpillar about <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June;</HI> it pa&s;&s;es to the Chry&s;alis &s;tate, and in <HI>July</HI> or <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> is a Papilio.</P>
<P>The great difficulty and trouble to rear the Caterpillars, when found; and greater difficulty to take the Fly, has &s;tamped a valuable con&s;i|deration on it, and particularly &s;o when fine, and a high price is but e&s;teemed an adequate compen&s;ation for it if in good pre&s;ervation. The male is &s;maller, but more beautiful than the female; the upper &s;ide of the wings of the female not being enriched with that vivid change of purple which the male po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in &s;uch an eminent degree; but the under&s;ide of the female is far richer in the various teints of colour than the male: they are both beautifully &s;potted, mottled, and waved with brown, black, white, and orange. The Chry&s;alis is of a very delicate texture, much re&s;embling thin white paper, and is tinged in &s;everal parts with a very lively purple hue which it borrows from the wings of the enclo&s;ed in&s;ect, and bears the characteri&s;tic mark of a Papilio, by being &s;u&s;pended from the tail, with the head downward.</P>

<P>Many &s;pecies of the <HI>Cimex</HI> genus differ &s;o materially in their ge|neral form, that very nice attention is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;criminate the &s;pecies which evidently belong to this exten&s;ive family. The external appearance of the Hou&s;e, or Scarlet Bug, cannot intimate the con|nection to the &s;ame genus with this &s;lender bodied in&s;ect; but &s;o they are arranged by Linnaeus, and &s;o they will appear on a proper in&s;pec|tion of tho&s;e parts which con&s;titute their generic character.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;pecies is common, and may be taken during great part of the warm &s;ea&s;ons. We have an In&s;ect of the &s;ame genus <HI>(Cimex Lacu&s;tris)</HI> which has frequently attracted notice by the va|riety and activity of its motions, when &s;porting on the &s;urface of &s;tagnant pools, or other &s;tanding water: It appears to fly, or &s;kim the &s;urface, but its wings are not often expanded, the lightne&s;s of its body
<PB N="6" REF="7">
and length of its legs, permitting it to dart with great velocity in any direction, and when it alights, it cau&s;es only a gentle tremulous motion beneath it. Its habits have much affinity to the generality of aquatic in&s;ects, and being con&s;tantly found on that element, would almo&s;t determine it to be of that race; but it is rather amphibious, and very rarely de&s;cends beneath the &s;urface. It will at intervals re&s;t for &s;everal minutes motionle&s;s on the water, its &s;ix legs are then ex|panded, and the tar&s;i of the feet only touch the &s;urface; but the <HI>Cimex Stagnorum</HI> is remarkable for the regularity and carefulne&s;s of all its actions; it rarely runs, but treads the water, &s;low, and ever appears to apprehend danger; it frequently pau&s;es &s;uddenly, and if it then perceives any thing di&s;agreeable, retires. Aquatic In&s;ects are generally &s;upplied at &s;everal parts of their body with an oily matter that the water can|not penetrate, and the legs of this In&s;ect is apparently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that property.</P>

The larva is not unlike the adult in&s;ect, though its body js longer and tapering, and it hath no &s;hells to defend it if in danger; its &s;ecurity therefore depends on its feet, which are rather longer, or at lea&s;t appear longer, than in the after-&s;tate; all the &s;pecies, whether as the larva or the adult, commonly feed on gra&s;s, but they as frequently are taken on the plantain, thi&s;tle and ro&s;e, or any other plant, whether wild or cultivated. They fa&s;ten them&s;elves to the leaves of any plant that is near when they enter the Chry&s;alis &s;tate, and its appearance is then as if it were tied to the leaf by threads which pa&s;s each other in tran&s;|ver&s;e directions; they remain only a few days in the Chry&s;alis, as it undergoes but little change. May, June, and July, or later if the weather &s;hould prove fine, is the time to find them; many of the &s;pecies are &s;o numerous in almo&s;t every &s;ituation, that collectors give little trouble to obtain them, or at lea&s;t &s;earch for &s;uch only as are mo&s;t uncommon.</P>

As Lepidopterous In&s;ects are not provided with any weapons, defen&s;ive or offen&s;ive, it will encounter the large&s;t, gra&s;p them in its claws, and tear them to pieces.

<P>The very &s;ingular manner in which this Caterpillar con&s;tructs its web, de&s;erves particular notice: previous to its transformation from the <HI>Larva</HI> to the <HI>Aurelia,</HI> it quits the tender plants which afford nou|ri&s;hment, and retires to tho&s;e, better calculated for its protection, in its defencele&s;s &s;tate; its choice is generally the Scirpus Lacu&s;tris <HI>(Bull Ru&s;h),</HI> or the &s;toute&s;t plant that is near, if its leaves are ru&s;hy and &s;trong. Its fir&s;t proce&s;s is to make a deep inci&s;ion acro&s;s the leaf, which it effects with little labour, as its mouth is well armed for the purpo&s;e; the upper part of the leaf being thus deprived of its &s;upport, in&s;tantly becomes dependent; the Caterpillar embraces the two &s;ur|faces of the fractured leaf, and weaves its web between.

<P>The Genus <HI>Tipula,</HI> compri&s;es an exten&s;ive family of the Dipterous Order, or of &s;uch In&s;ects as are furni&s;hed with two Wings only. Our large&s;t Species are <HI>Tip.</HI> Rivo&s;a, Crocata, Lunata, &amp;c. the mo&s;t com|mon is <HI>T.</HI> Oleracea, generally known by the trivial appellations, <HI>Long Legs, Old Father,</HI> &amp;c. It is, as are al&s;o the other Species, perfectly harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive; yet their &s;ingular form, and more particularly the extraordinary di&s;proportion of their legs, operates frequently to their di&s;advantage with the ignorant, who readily &s;uppo&s;e they have to avoid, the &s;ecreted &s;ting, of whatever appears aukward or uncommon.</P>
<P>Our &s;maller Species are infinitely more numerous, and many of them are not de&s;cribed, being &s;o very minute as to remain unnoticed. The <HI>Tipula Plumo&s;a,</HI> Plate XXII, differs materially in its general appear|ance from the larger kinds.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="37">We rarely find a &s;pecimen of the larger kinds of Tipula with the legs complete; the lo&s;s of one or two of tho&s;e members do not materially retard the bri&s;kne&s;s of its motions, but it cannot fly after &s;uffering a total amputation, though it will then live a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>The Tipula Rivo&s;a being entangled by two of its legs in the &s;nare of a large &s;pider [ARANEA DIADEMA], at fir&s;t endeavoured to di&s;|engage them by force, but this rather added to its calamity, and a third leg was attracted by the glutinous matter on the threads; the &s;pider approached, and the creature accelerated its e&s;cape by leaving its legs in the web. It is very common to ob&s;erve the broken limbs of the <HI>Tipulae</HI> in the &s;nares of this &s;pecies of &s;pider.</P>
<P>The Larvae of many Tipulae, more e&s;pecially the very minute &s;orts, are found in &s;tanding water, but the larger, generally feed on the roots of gra&s;s, and may be found by turning up the light &s;urface of the earth. The Tipula Rivo&s;a is taken in May and June, the Tipula Crocata in June and July; the latter is ob&s;erved in the flower-garden or orchard.</P>

<P>The Genus <HI>Aranea</HI> includes a va&s;t, if not endle&s;s variety of &s;pecies, and though the greate&s;t di&s;&s;imilarity may be ob&s;erved as to &s;ize, pro|portion, or colouring, of many individual kinds, yet the rapaciou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="34" REF="40">
common to the family, is apparent in all. Our dome&s;tic Spiders are plain in their colours, and &s;eldom attain a very extraordinary &s;ize; the gardens are infe&s;ted by &s;pecies &s;omewhat larger, and more lively in their marks and teints, but if we wi&s;h to trace the ju&s;t gradations of the beauty, or &s;ize, of tho&s;e dete&s;table creatures, the fore&s;ts abound; and will afford the highe&s;t gratification to the enquiries of the naturali&s;t. We have Spiders purely white, or white &s;tained with a lovely green; yellow, marked with a vivid red; purples &s;haded with the riche&s;t hues, and the brighte&s;t browns, be&s;pangled with the utmo&s;t elegance and &s;ymmetry: Yet under tho&s;e rich adornments which nature has &s;o pro|fu&s;ely be&s;towed on this complication of beauty, and ferocity, we di&s;|cover inherent qualities, which, in larger animals, would become formidable, and though we feel confident of our &s;uperiority over the in&s;idious art of &s;uch a contemptible creature, yet the mind is &s;u&s;cepti|ble of an inward abhorrence at its touch, which neither the expan&s;ion of philo&s;ophy, or ignorance of its di&s;po&s;ition, will &s;ometimes &s;uppre&s;s. It is probable, that <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> in his de&s;cription of the Spider, felt this &s;ympathy of the human mind,
<Q><L>"&mdash;To heedle&s;s flies the window proves</L>
<L>A con&s;tant death; where, gloomily retired,</L>
<L>The villain Spider lives, cunning and fierce,</L>
<L>Mixture abhorr'd! Amid a mangled heap</L>
<L>Of carca&s;es, in eager watch he &s;its,</L>
<L>O'er-looking all his waving &s;nares around.</L>
<L>Near the dire cell, the dreadle&s;s wanderer oft</L>
<L>Pa&s;&s;es, as oft the ruffian &s;hews his front;</L>
<L>The prey at la&s;t en&s;nar'd, he dreadful darts</L>
<L>With rapid glide along the leaning line;</L>
<L>And fixing in the wretch his cruel fangs,</L>
<L>Strikes backward grimly pleas'd: the flutt'ring wing,</L>
<L>And &s;hriller found declare extreme di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>And a&s;k the helping ho&s;pitable hand."</L></Q></P>
<P>Early in the &s;pring we find the ne&s;ts of Spiders in the crevices of old walls, trees, and other ob&s;cure places. They are enclo&s;ed in webs of a white, yellow, or grey colour, varying according to the
<PB N="35" REF="41">
&s;pecies; immediately that the warmth of the &s;un has hatched them, they di&s;per&s;e, it being no longer nece&s;&s;ary to live in &s;ocieties, which indeed, would deprive &s;ome of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>In February we took a ne&s;t of minute yellowi&s;h eggs, which proved to be the infant offspring of the A. Diadema, they &s;carcely exceeded the &s;ize of a pin's head when hatched, and were of a bright yellow colour; at fir&s;t their food was the common hou&s;e fly, but their increa&s;e in bulk was &s;o rapid that it was nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy many, to pre&s;erve a few; we therefore &s;elected four &s;pecimens, which being fed in &s;eparate gla&s;&s;es, and on different in&s;ects, exhibited each a di&s;tinct degree of &s;trength, and colour. One &s;pecimen de&s;troyed thirty of the common hou&s;e fly in a day; it then appeared much enlarged, and the colours were almo&s;t black, except the &s;pots of white, which &s;parkled with infinite lu&s;tre; but being confined a week without a fre&s;h &s;upply, its colours were con&s;iderably faded; another week of ab&s;tinence reduced its colours to a pale uniform brown, the body was much wa&s;ted, and the creature became perfectly ravenous. It devoured a va&s;t quantity of food, and recovered much of its former colours a few hours after.</P>
<P>Our large&s;t Spiders are incomparable for their &s;ize, or venomous qualities, to the productions of America, or of the ea&s;tern countries; in Germany they are far &s;uperior in &s;ize to our &s;pecimens, but in Surinam they are infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, Spiders of tho&s;e parts being often found with legs as thick as a goo&s;e-quill, and three or four inches in length, which with difficulty &s;upport a body as large as a pullet's egg. Their &s;nares are commonly extended from one branch of a tree to another, covering the &s;pace of twenty or thirty feet, and is &s;uffi|ciently &s;trong to entangle the large&s;t in&s;ects. A. Seba has figured a Spider of this de&s;cription, as de&s;cending from an arm of a tree, into the ne&s;t of a &s;mall &s;pecies of Humming Bird, to &s;uck the blood of the parent, and eggs.</P>
<P>"The eyes of the Spider are a very beautiful micro&s;copic object, viewed either as tran&s;parent or opake; they have generally eight, two on the top of the head, that look directly upwards; two in the front, a little below the foregoing, to di&s;cover what pa&s;&s;es before it; and on each &s;ide a couple more, one whereof points &s;ideways forward, the other &s;ideways backward; &s;o that it can &s;ee almo&s;t all around it. They are immoveable, and &s;eem to be formed of a hard, tran&s;parent, horny &s;ub|&s;tance. The number of eyes is not the &s;ame in all the &s;pecies of the
<PB N="36" REF="42">
Spider. They have eight legs, with &s;ix joints, thickly be&s;et with hairs, and terminating in two crooked moveable claws, which have little teeth like a &s;aw; at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the&s;e claws, but placed higher up, is another, &s;omewhat like a cock's &s;pur, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which it adheres to it's webs; but the weapon wherewith it &s;eizes and kills its prey is a pair of &s;harp crooked claws, or forceps, placed in the fore-part of the head. They can open or extend the&s;e pincers as occa&s;ion may require; when undi&s;turbed they &s;uffer them to lie one upon another. Mr. <HI>Lewenhoeck</HI> &s;ays, that each of the&s;e claws has a &s;mall aperture, or &s;lit, through which he &s;uppo&s;es a poi&s;onous juice is injected into the wound it makes.</P>
<P>"The exuvia of the Spider, which may be found in cobwebs, be|ing tran&s;parent, is an excellent object; and the fangs, or forceps, may be ea&s;ier &s;eparated from it, and examined with more exactne&s;s than in a living Spider. The contexture of the Spider's web, and their man|ner of weaving them, have been di&s;covered by the micro&s;cope. The Spider is &s;upplied with a large quantity of glutinous matter within it's body, and five dugs, or teats, for &s;pinning it into thread. This &s;ub&s;tance, when examined accurately, will be found twi&s;ted into many coils, of an agate colour, and which, from its tenacity, may be ea&s;ily drawn out into threads. The five teats are placed near the extremity of its tail; from the&s;e the afore&s;aid &s;ub&s;tance proceeds; it adheres to any thing it is pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t, and being drawn out, hardens in the air. The Spider can contract or dilate at plea&s;ure the orifices through which the threads are drawn. The threads unite at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the body, &s;o that tho&s;e which appear to us &s;o fine and &s;ingle, are notwith&s;tanding compo&s;ed of five joined together, and the&s;e are many times doubled when the web is in formation."</P>

<P>A very elegant, though common Species of the Sphinx <HI>Genus:</HI> it is taken in the months June and July. After the In&s;ect dies, the colour of the thorax and abdomen, except the yellow bands, is en|tirely black, or black with a very faint glo&s;s of a reddi&s;h blue: but is an exceedingly brilliant dark purple, while the creature is alive; and the yellow belts on the alternate divi&s;ions of the body, glitter in the &s;un&s;hine with the effulgence of molten gold. The legs are yet more beautiful, as the purple, though paler, is of a livelier lu&s;tre; and every joint is deeply fringed with the &s;ame golden colour as that on the body.
<PB N="42" REF="50">
The wings, which are perfectly tran&s;parent, except at the apex, are delicately veined, and ribbed with black lines. The fan tail is expanded or contracted at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>If the creature bur&s;ts from it's chry&s;alis in the morning, it is gene|rally ob&s;erved &s;porting among the leaves of the neare&s;t plants about noon; and this is commonly the time the male is &s;een &s;eeking its mate.</P>
<P>It's very &s;ingular appearance before the opaque micro&s;cope, induced us to give the magnified figure, together with the Caterpillar, Chry|&s;alis, and Sphinx, of the natural &s;ize.</P>

<P>The Female depo&s;its her eggs in the crevices of &s;uch twigs as are hollow; and a peculiar in&s;tinct almo&s;t invariably directs her to the &s;talks of the currant trees: which are not only ea&s;y of acce&s;s, but afford grateful nouri&s;hment to the young brood. Immediately that the Caterpillar is enlarged from the egg, it perforates the &s;talk, and, hav|ing entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the inner channel, it feeds on the &s;oft &s;ub&s;tance which is abundant within. Thus it is &s;ecured by nature, with a de|fence again&s;t many depredators, to which all Caterpillars, except in|ternal feeders, are expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It changes to a Chry&s;alis within the &s;talk.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time before the In&s;ect bur&s;ts forth, the Chry&s;alis is pro|truded through the outer bark, preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner as the Chry&s;alis of the <HI>Sp.

<P>The <HI>Sp.

<P><HI>Cicada Spumaria</HI> is not only common in this country, but is abun|dant in every part of Europe. It frequents mo&s;t plants, but tho&s;e e&s;pecially which exhale much moi&s;ture.

<P>"The CUCKOW-SPIT, or FROTH-WORM, is often found hid in that frothy matter which we find on the &s;urface of plants. It has an oblong, obtu&s;e body; and a large head, with &s;mall eyes. The ex|ternal Wings, for it hath four, are of a du&s;ky brown colour, marked with two white &s;pots: the head is black. The &s;pume in which it is found wallowing, is all of its own formation, and very much re&s;embles frothy &s;pittle. It proceeds from the vent of the animal, and other parts of the body; and, if it be wiped away, a new quantity will be quickly &s;een ejected from the little animal's body. Within this &s;pume, it is &s;een in time to acquire four tubercles on its back, wherein the wings are enclo&s;ed: the&s;e bur&s;ting, from a reptile it becomes a winged animal."</P>
<P>The colour of the winged In&s;ect is found to vary from a deep cho|colate, to a very pale brown. It is taken in July and Augu&s;t.</P>

<P>This elegant &s;pecies of the <HI>Noctua</HI> divi&s;ion of Moths, appears to be not only a nonde&s;cript, but altogether unknown before; even to the be&s;t practical entymologi&s;ts: That an in&s;ect of &s;uch magnitude &s;hould have been unnoticed by <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> or <HI>Fabricius,</HI> is not very &s;ingular, as &s;everal nonde&s;cripts of a &s;imilar, and many of an inferior,

<P>We have &s;ought every information which our connection would permit; and from the re&s;ult we &s;carcely he&s;itate to pronounce the in&s;ect of a nonde&s;cript &s;pecies, and our &s;pecimen to be perfectly unique; at lea&s;t it is a newly-di&s;covered acqui&s;ition to many &s;cientific entymologi&s;ts.</P>
<P>The original, whence the figure has been copied, is in the collec|tion of the author; it was taken in a lane leading immediately from the wood at <HI>Tottenham,</HI> the la&s;t week in June, 1793. It was di&s;|covered in the evening, on a blade of gra&s;s; and, from its wet ap|pearance, as well as exqui&s;ite pre&s;ervation, it had certainly ju&s;t emerged from its chry&s;alis.</P>
<P>The Caterpillar may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be an underground feeder, and to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the roots of gra&s;s, &amp;c. or one of that kind which comes only above the &s;urface of the earth in the night.</P>

<P>The male is &s;maller than the female; they &s;ecrete them&s;elves be|neath the &s;urface of the earth, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the roots of gra&s;s, or herbage in general: are &s;ometimes found by turning up the mould, or may be ob&s;erved crawling among the gra&s;s. Come forth in April, or May.</P>

<P>This &s;pecies is found in every part of Europe, though very &s;carce; and in England it is extremely rare.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="115">And it is no le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed for the very &s;ingular &s;tructure and length of its antennae, than for its rarity; that part which forms one of the mo&s;t certain characteri&s;tics of almo&s;t every tribe of In&s;ects, con&s;titutes the mo&s;t prominent character in this.</P>
<P>Of its u&s;e, we are altogether ignorant, as the various opinions that have been given by former writers are now obliterated; &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed that they were the organs of hearing, or &s;mell; and others have imagined that they were &s;u&s;ceptible of the lea&s;t motion in the ambient fluid in which they move.</P>
<P>Geoffroy di&s;covered the organs of hearing in &s;everal amphibious animals, viz. in the toad, frog, viper, &s;ome other &s;erpents, lizard, water-&s;alamander, and &s;kate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires Etrangers de l'Acad. de Paris, 1755.</NOTE>; and many of the mo&s;t eminent ana|tomi&s;ts of the pre&s;ent time have di&s;covered by their re&s;earches into the animal kingdom, tho&s;e organs in different creatures. Profe&s;|&s;or Camper, in 1763, publi&s;hed remarks on the organs of hearing in fi&s;hes, in the Harlem Tran&s;actions <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the Year 1763, &amp;c.</NOTE>: Mr. Hunter has de&s;cribed others in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. lxxii.</NOTE>; and Dr. Monro has de|&s;cribed and figured great variety of them in his large work on the &s;tructure and phy&s;iology of fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Probably, induced by tho&s;e di&s;coveries profe&s;&s;or Fabricius endea|voured to a&s;certain the organs of hearing in In&s;ects al&s;o; and about nine years ago publi&s;hed an account of this intere&s;ting di&s;covery in the New Copenhagen Tran&s;actions <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 375.</NOTE>, with figures of tho&s;e organs in the crab and lob&s;ter: he found the external orifice of the organ in the&s;e animals to be placed between the long and the &s;hort antennae, the cochlea, &amp;c. being lodged in the upper part, which Linnaeus calls the thorax, near the ba&s;e of the &s;errated projection at its apex; we mu&s;t therefore conclude that the antennae of In&s;ects are appropriated for &s;ome other purpo&s;es than tho&s;e it is at pre&s;ent &s;u&s;pected they an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The Cerambyx Aedilis, Fabricius informs us, lives in the trunks of trees; its horns are moveable, as it can either direct them forward, or &s;upport them in an erect po&s;ition; and when it &s;leeps, it reclines them along its back; it al&s;o reclines them when it walks quick, or has to pa&s;s through a narrow track, as the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance from any thing in its way, would be very liable to injure, or break them off.</P>
