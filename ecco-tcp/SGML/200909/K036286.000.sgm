<HEAD>AN EXAMINATION OF THE AGE OF REASON, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the former writings of <HI>Thomas Paine</HI> abound with indications of original conception and profound thought, of comprehen&s;ion and &s;a|gacity, far beyond the vigour of vulgar minds, no man, I pre&s;ume, of character for intelligence and integrity will venture to deny. To the authority of venal &s;ycophants, and all the retainers of cor|rupt and wicked &s;y&s;tems, whether in <HI>politics</HI> or <HI>religion,</HI> no competency can be allowed in a deci|&s;ion upon this &s;ubject: but, on the contrary, the virulence of their abu&s;e is in it&s;elf no unequivocal &s;ymptom of extraordinary merit: ju&s;t as the &s;creams and tumult of the feathered tribe prove &s;ome bird of nobler pre&s;ence and more ample pi|nion to be approaching. The work, which I have undertaken to examine, is entitled to particular re&s;pect from the circum&s;tances of it's compo&s;ition.
<PB N="2" REF="5">It is the effu&s;ion of a pregnant intellect, &s;obered by the meditations of a &s;olitary pri&s;on, not unat|tended probably by &s;ome apprehen&s;ions of &s;uch a cata&s;trophe, as a cri&s;is of things &s;o novel and event|ful, may daily and hourly be expected to produce. The reflections therefore of &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, from &s;o popular a name, on a &s;ubject of &s;uch univer|&s;al intere&s;t, is &s;ecure, we may pre&s;ume, of con&s;ider|able attention in this country, from tho&s;e who are occupied in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of their <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>religious creed:</HI> a number, which has certainly in|crea&s;ed of late with &s;urpri&s;ing rapidity, and will, I hope and believe, go on encrea&s;ing with an ac|celerated progre&s;s. On this account, I conceived my&s;elf not unlikely to &s;erve the cau&s;e of revealed truth by an examination of a dei&s;tical pamphlet, which &s;eemed &s;o fair a candidate for exten&s;ive cir|culation: and I felt the more inclination to this talk, not from an arrogant per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;uperior knowledge and abilities, but from a clear con|viction, that <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> CANNOT be vindicated adequately and con&s;i&s;tently again&s;t <HI>Dei&s;m</HI> by any &s;lave of <HI>&s;y&s;tems</HI> and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hments;</HI> well aware in the mean time, that all my zeal for <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> will not &s;creen me from the malice of tho&s;e, who love <HI>church-emoluments</HI> better than <HI>&s;cripture-truth;</HI> becau&s;e an opportunity will ari&s;e of expo&s;ing the trumpery and non&s;en&s;e of <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tics.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">The time is come, when all our opinions mu&s;t be tried at the touch&s;tone of &s;evere enquiry: and, if the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations cannot &s;upport them&s;elves again&s;t the batteries of their a&s;&s;ailants, in the e&s;timation of capable and di&s;in|tere&s;ted judges, the out-po&s;ts mu&s;t be abandoned; and a retreat &s;ecured to the fortre&s;&s;es of <HI>dei&s;m,</HI> al|ready occupied by the patriarchs of old, and the illu&s;trious philo&s;ophers of later times. The &s;way of <HI>creeds</HI> and <HI>councils,</HI> of <HI>hierarchies</HI> and <HI>churches,</HI> whether <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> or <HI>Popi&s;h,</HI> over the bodies and con&s;ciences of men, is dimini&s;hing apace: and the temple of revelation, deprived of the mouldering props, which prie&s;tcraft, and tyranny, and &s;uper&s;ti|tion had framed for it's &s;upport, mu&s;t repo&s;e &s;olely on it's proper ba&s;is, the adamant of TRUTH.</P>
<P>After premi&s;ing a &s;hort introduction, explana|tory of his motives to this work, our ingenuous author delivers his creed:</P>
<P><Q>I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happine&s;s beyond this life.</Q></P>
<P>I join the writer in a&s;&s;ent to the&s;e articles of faith. That <HI>Creed</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tian Churches,</HI> which acknowledges <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> al&s;o to be <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> to be God, is a fundamental violation
<PB N="4" REF="7">of all theology; a doctrine, alike unknown to the <HI>Heathens</HI> and the <HI>Jews,</HI> and contemplated with abhorrence by the followers of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> from it's fir&s;t propagation to this very day: a doctrine, incon|&s;i&s;tent with the plaine&s;t declarations of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf and his apo&s;tles; a doctrine, which no human te&s;timony whatever could render credible; a doctrine, which will happily prove a mill-&s;tone of de&s;truction to all <HI>political</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hments of <HI>chri&s;tianity.</HI></P>
<P>Our author thus proceeds in his confe&s;&s;ion: <Q>I believe the equality of man, and I believe that religious duties con&s;i&s;t in doing ju&s;tice, loving mercy, and endeavouring to make our fellow-creatures happy.</Q></P>
<P>All diver&s;ity of <HI>civil privileges</HI> and <HI>titular di&s;|tinctions;</HI> all inequality, but the tran&s;ient and ca|&s;ual inequality produced by per&s;onal exertion, public benefit, or private worth, is de&s;titute of even the &s;hadow of &s;upport from nature or revela|tion. We are all children of one common father: and <HI>Je&s;us</HI> of <HI>Nazareth</HI> allowed no pre-eminence among his di&s;ciples, but that of mutual &s;ubjection, conde&s;cending &s;ervice, profound humility, and &s;elf-aba&s;ement
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matthew, xx. 25&mdash;29. Romans, xii. 2. Ephe&s;ians, v. 21. 2 Peter, v. 5.</NOTE>; of which lowly virtues he pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="5" REF="8">him&s;elf as a complete example. It requires but a trivial portion of &s;agacity to di&s;cover, that certain orders and de&s;criptions of frail creatures, encompa&s;&s;ed with every inducement to be corrupt <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> and plentifully furni&s;hed with every means of corrupting <HI>others,</HI> cannot be peculiarly calculated to promote the general happine&s;s of mankind; and this happine&s;s we are compelled to regard as the prime object of the divine ad|mini&s;tration. It was a beautiful &s;entiment of Plato
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dial. v. de Republic&acirc;.&mdash;</NOTE>, that <Q>the affairs of &s;tates would never be well conducted, 'till philo&s;ophers were kings, or kings philo&s;ophers.</Q> He, who vindicates corruption in &s;ociety, and di&s;countenances a pro|gre&s;s to all perfection, of which humanity is capable, from the &s;tale topic of the inevitable depravity of human beings, di&s;courages every effort for virtu|ous pre-eminence, degrades the dignity of our nature, libels his &s;pecies, and thwarts the mea|&s;ures of divine government. <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> at lea&s;t might be expected to be&s;tow &s;ome readine&s;s in their attempts of conforming to the injunctions of their divine teachers, by &s;triving to be <HI>perfect</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Philippians, iii. 12. 2 Tim. iii. 17.</NOTE>, <HI>and thoroughly furni&s;hed unto all good works</HI> by <Q>leaving the principles of the doctrine of Chri&s;t, and go|ing on unto <HI>perfection</HI>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hebrews, vi. 1.</NOTE>.</Q> In our pre&s;ent &s;tate of embarra&s;&s;ment and degradation from a thou&s;and
<PB N="6" REF="9">cau&s;es, it were pre&s;umptuous ignorance, border|ing on profanene&s;s, to pre&s;cribe a limit to the ca|pacities of mortality, either in moral or intel|lectual exertion. He at lea&s;t cannot be deemed <HI>unfriendly</HI> to his &s;pecies, or contemptuous to the divinity, who thinks re&s;pectably of the workman|&s;hip of God, of the rational image of his Creator.</P>
<P>Again: <Q>I do not believe in the creed profe&s;&s;ed by the Jewi&s;h church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turki&s;h church, by the Prote&s;tant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.</Q></P>
<P>This too may be conceded, if by <Q>the creed of the Prote&s;tant church,</Q> be meant that mon|&s;trous farrago of ab&s;urdities and contradictions, concentrated with mo&s;t ingenious and compre|hen&s;ive brevity, in the <HI>creeds</HI> denominated the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Nicene;</HI> which, without the expe|dient of repeating backwards, would

<PB N="7" REF="10">found indeed in the <HI>liturgies</HI> of <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed churches,</HI> but are certainly not "written in the book of life."</P>
<P><Q>All national in&s;titutions of churches, whe|ther Jewi&s;h, Chri&s;tian, or Turki&s;h, appear to me no other than human inventions &s;et up to terrify and en&s;lave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.</Q></P>
<P>A ju&s;t remark, conci&s;ely and pregnantly ex|pre&s;&s;ed. <HI>National churches</HI> are that <HI>hay and &s;tubble</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Corinthians, iii. 12.</NOTE> which might be removed without difficulty or confu&s;ion, from the fabric of religion, by the gentle hand of reformation, but which the infa|tuation of <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tics</HI> will leave to be de&s;troyed <HI>by fire</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">ver&s;e, 13.</NOTE>. <HI>National churches</HI> are that incru&s;tation, which has enveloped, by gradual concretion, the diamond of <HI>chri&s;tianity;</HI> nor can, I fear, the ge|nuine lu&s;tre be re&s;tored, but by &s;uch violent efforts as the &s;eparation of &s;ub&s;tances &s;o long and clo&s;ely connected mu&s;t inevitably require.</P>
<P>Nor can I forbear the quotation of another pa|ragraph, replete with manly &s;en&s;e and dignified mo|rality, conveyed in &s;imple but energetic language;
<PB N="8" REF="11">though not immediately pertinent to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, which I have in view; e&s;pecially as fewer occa|&s;ions of approbation and coincidence will be pre|&s;ented in our progre&s;s through the pamphlet.</P>
<P><Q>It is impo&s;&s;ible to calculate the moral mi&s;chief, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, that mental lying has pro|duced in &s;ociety. When a man has &s;o far cor|rupted and pro&s;tituted the cha&s;tity of his mind, as to &s;ub&s;cribe his profe&s;&s;ional belief to things he does not believe, he has prepared him&s;elf for the commi&s;&s;ion of every other crime. He takes up the trade of a prie&s;t for the &s;ake of gain, and in order to <HI>qualify</HI> him&s;elf for that trade, he begins with a perjury. Can we conceive any thing more de&s;tructive to morality than this?</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e very rational and important ob&s;ervations are applicable in the fulle&s;t latitude to the <HI>&s;ub&s;crip|tions</HI> exacted from young men at our <HI>Univer&s;ities</HI> for <HI>degrees,</HI> and for the candidates for the mini&s;try in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> It is a mo&s;t &s;hocking reflection to every lover of truth and hone&s;ty, that a requi&s;ition to acknowledge a multitudinous ma&s;s of <HI>theological</HI> and <HI>political</HI> propo&s;itions, deno|minated <HI>articles of religion,</HI> which many have never read, and which they, who read, cannot under|&s;tand; that an a&s;&s;ent, I &s;ay, to &s;uch a mon&s;trous
<PB N="9" REF="12">and unintelligible hodge podge of &s;chola&s;tic reve|ries &s;hould be made an indi&s;pen&s;able condition to the privilege of preaching the <HI>truths</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI> The &s;implicity and &s;incerity of the go&s;pel cannot fail of furtherance and &s;upport, beyond all contro|ver&s;y, from tho&s;e, who begin their godly functions in &s;uch trifling with veracity and the &s;olemnity of oaths! who thus bind them&s;elves to the belief of certain tenets manufactured and impo&s;ed by others; and thereby preclude them&s;elves (in addition to the indirect impediment in the way of acquiring truth, interpo&s;ed by this unequivocal declaration of indifference to her intere&s;ts) from pur&s;uing their theological enquiries beyond the limits a&s;&s;igned by <HI>councils</HI> and <HI>parliaments</HI> in former days, by an ex|pre&s;s obligation not to exceed the knowledge of their forefathers, nor to di&s;pute their opinions, whether true or fal&s;e. I cannot my&s;elf conceive a ca&s;e more palpably immoral and indefen&s;ible: nor can we be &s;urpri&s;ed at a plenteous harve&s;t of <HI>unbelievers</HI> in a vineyard cultivated by labourers of this complexion.</P>
<P><Q>Every national church or religion has e&s;tabli&s;h|ed it&s;elf by pretending &s;ome &s;pecial mi&s;&s;ion from God communicated to certain individuals. The Jews have their Mo&s;es; the Chri&s;tians their Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their apo&s;tles and &s;aints; and the Turks
<PB N="10" REF="13">their Mahomet; as if the way to God was not open to every man alike.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;tatement is frivolous and erroneous in the extreme. The &s;y&s;tem of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> pro|ceeds upon the very &s;uppo&s;ition here in&s;tituted, that "the way to God <HI>is</HI> open to every man alike;" as might be proved by many pa&s;&s;ages in the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Scriptures. What the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> maintain in behalf of their re&s;pective &s;y&s;|tems, is: that their founders delivered to man|kind rational &s;entiments of the Divine nature, of his exi&s;tence, and his providential government of the world, at a time, when ignorance and deprava|tion, with re&s;pect to the&s;e fundamental canons of religious rectitude, were almo&s;t univer&s;ally predo|minant. With relation to the writings of the <HI>Jews,</HI> it is altogether undeniable, and is a truth of the ut|mo&s;t weight and magnitude, that our accumulated di&s;coveries in &s;cience and philo&s;ophy, and all our progre&s;s in other parts of knowledge, has not en|abled the wi&s;e&s;t of the moderns to excel the noble &s;entiments conveyed in the didactics and devo|tional compo&s;itions of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament;</HI> com|po&s;itions, many of which exi&s;ted, without di&s;pute, before the earlie&s;t writings of heathen antiquity, and at a period, when even tho&s;e illu&s;trious in|&s;tructors of mankind, the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> were
<PB N="11" REF="14">barbarous and unknown. It would gratify me much, I confe&s;s, to be informed in what manner the contemners of the <HI>Jews</HI> and of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> &s;y&s;|tem account for this &s;ingular <HI>phoenomenon:</HI> which indeed might be &s;tated with abundantly more full|ne&s;s and cogency, if it were nece&s;&s;ary on this oc|ca&s;ion. Will <HI>Thomas Paine</HI> the <HI>dei&s;t,</HI> or any of our modern <HI>athei&s;ts,</HI> undertake the &s;olution of this difficulty?&mdash;Be&s;ides, let any man compare the &s;im|ple morality and the noble precepts of the Go&s;pel, as they relate to the attributes of God and the du|ties of humanity, with the mon&s;trous theology, with the &s;ubtleties and the contradictory &s;chemes of contemporary morali&s;ts, among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Ro|mans;</HI> (who neverthele&s;s had, in all probability, profited mediately or immediately by the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;y&s;tem, which could not exi&s;t without diffu&s;ing &s;ome influence through the neighbourhood) and reflect at the &s;ame time, that a perfect manual of morality may be collected from a few pages in the go&s;pel, but mu&s;t be picked in <HI>Pagan</HI> writers from a multitude of di&s;cordant volumes, and a ma&s;s of incoherency and ab&s;urdity: and then conde&s;cend to furni&s;h us with an explanation of what mu&s;t be allowed on all hands a &s;urpri&s;ing fact; namely, the exi&s;tence of &s;uch &s;uperior intelligence in a <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> carpenter at <HI>Nazareth.</HI> So then, though we con|cede to <HI>Mr Paine,</HI> that "the way to God was open
<PB N="12" REF="15">to every man alike," we affirm of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> di&s;pen&s;ations, that <HI>they</HI> only were <HI>this way</HI> to any man de&s;irous of entertaining rational no|tions of God and human duty. Without the illu|mination, which has been di&s;tributed through the world from the&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations, <HI>Thomas Paine,</HI> and other <HI>dei&s;ts</HI> of our own and &s;ucceeding ages, who fancy them&s;elves &s;o very philo&s;ophical and intelli|gent in their theology, would have known full as little of the matter, to &s;peak with moderation, as much wi&s;er heads than their's, among the illu&s;tri|ous nations of antiquity, deprived of the&s;e advan|tages, &s;o much contemned and &s;o ungratefully en|joyed. The natural inference from the&s;e indubit|able po&s;itions is clearly, <HI>&s;ome</HI> degree of &s;upernatu|ral communication, which we &s;tile <HI>Revelation,</HI> to the founders of <HI>Judai&s;m</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tianity, Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> and the denial of &s;uch communica|tion leaves a problem, I apprehend, of much more arduous &s;olution; but which we may now expect the wonderful di&s;ciples of modern rea&s;on to ex|plain in a way, that will leave no further difficul|ties on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><Q>As it is nece&s;&s;ary to affix right ideas to words, I will, before I proceed further into the &s;ubject, offer &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the word <HI>revelation.</HI> Revelation, when applied to religion, means
<PB N="13" REF="16">&s;omething communicated <HI>immediately</HI> from God to man.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No one will deny or di&s;pute the power of the Almighty to make &s;uch a communication if he plea&s;es. But admitting for the &s;ake of a ca&s;e, that &s;omething has been revealed to a certain per&s;on, and not revealed to any other per&s;on, it is revelation to that per&s;on only. When he tells it to a &s;econd per&s;on, a &s;econd to a third, a third to a fourth, and &s;o on, it cea&s;es to be a revelation to all tho&s;e per&s;ons. It is revelation to the fir&s;t per&s;on only, and <HI>hear&s;ay</HI> to every other; and con&s;equently, they are not obliged to believe it.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;tatement al&s;o is inaccurate, fallacious, and inconclu&s;ive. Let us &s;ee, if we can exhibit a rational and unexceptionable repre&s;entation of the point in que&s;tion. A revelation is made to one per&s;on in the fir&s;t in&s;tance; <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> for example. He communicates this revelation to a <HI>&s;econd</HI> party, his countrymen, the children of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> But does he expect them to believe this me&s;&s;age on a mere a&s;&s;ertion, &s;o that their a&s;&s;ent may be &s;tiled a <HI>hear&s;ay</HI> revelation? No &s;uch thing. He delivers his credentials with the me&s;&s;age, and &s;anctions his preten&s;ions by &s;ome di&s;play of
<PB N="14" REF="17">&s;upernatural agency. Whether &s;uch di&s;play were in reality made in the ca&s;e before us, is not now the que&s;tion: I am only exhibiting the propo&s;ition in it's proper form, and &s;tating the fact, as it exi&s;ts, whether authentically or otherwi&s;e, in the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> hi&s;tory: and hence, I think, it is abundantly ma|nife&s;t, that <HI>Mr Paine's</HI> notions of the character and condition of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> revela|tions are &s;o confu&s;ed, as to render his account al|together un&s;uitable to the purpo&s;e in view, and mo&s;t effectually impertinent. And this an&s;wer, I ap|prehend, will &s;erve for all contained in the &s;uc|ceeding paragraphs, which are al&s;o wholly foreign to the &s;ubject; a mere inapplicable figment of our author's bewildered imagination.</P>
<P><Q>It is a contradiction in terms and ideas to call any thing a revelation that comes to us at &s;econd hand, either verbally or in writing.

Now, if it &s;hould be rejoined to the&s;e allegations, (and nothing el&s;e di&s;coverable by me can be rejoined) that <HI>miracles,</HI> if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> really per|formed them, would not have failed to overpower their prejudices and animo&s;ity; I reply <HI>fir&s;t;</HI> that the <HI>Jews,</HI> who admitted the po&s;&s;ibility of working miracles by a confederacy with evil &s;pirits, and a &s;kill in magical operations
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is manife&s;t from <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> as well as various pa&s;&s;ages of the <HI>New-Te&s;tament.</HI></NOTE>, would much more ea&s;ily take refuge in that popular &s;olution, than &s;urrender their emoluments, their vices, and their religious profe&s;&s;ions, entwined as the&s;e were with great intellectual depravity; than offer up &s;uch co&s;tly &s;acrifices to the name and authority of a dete&s;ted Cen&s;or. And, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> daily expe|rience
<PB N="31" REF="34">pre&s;ents us with innumerable in&s;tances of a per&s;everance in vice and folly, which, the unhappy victims of this tyranny are in their own minds fully a&s;&s;ured, will as inevitably terminate in wretched|ne&s;s and de&s;truction, as if the evidence of &s;uch an i&s;&s;ue were a&s;certained by a <HI>miracle.</HI></P>
<P>But the &s;ubject before us admits of further illu&s;|tration from the example of <HI>Mr. Paine</HI> him&s;elf. In this country, where his oppo&s;ition to the corrup|tions of government has rai&s;ed him &s;o many ad|ver&s;aries, and &s;uch a &s;warm of unprincipled hire|lings have exerted them&s;elves in blackening his character and in mi&s;repre&s;enting all the tran&s;ac|tions and incidents of his life; will it not be a mo&s;t difficult, nay, an impo&s;&s;ible ta&s;k, for po&s;terity, after a lap&s;e of 1700 years, if &s;uch a wreck of modern literature, as that of the ancient, &s;hould intervene, to identify the real circum&s;tances, moral and civil, of the man? And would a true hi&s;torian, &s;uch as the <HI>evangelists,</HI> be credited at that future period again&s;t &s;uch a predominant incredulity, without large and weighty acce&s;&s;ions of collateral atte&s;ta|tion? And how tran&s;cendently extraordinary, I had almo&s;t &s;aid <HI>miraculous,</HI> will it be e&s;teemed, by candid and rea&s;onable minds, that a writer, who&s;e object was, a melioration of condition to the com|mon people, and their deliverance from oppre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="32" REF="35">poverty, and wretchedne&s;s, to the numberle&s;s ble&s;|&s;ings of upright and equal government, &s;hould be reviled, per&s;ecuted, and burned in e&s;&s;igy, with every circum&s;tance of in&s;ult and execration, by the&s;e very objects of his benevolent intentions, in every corner of the kingdom?</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we find no difficulty in declar|ing, that what has a&s;toni&s;hed <HI>Mr. Paine</HI> &s;o long, &s;hould a&s;toni&s;h him no longer: as no &s;pecies of rea&s;oning is more common and more legitimate, than that which proves the truth of a circum&s;tance from the evidence of corrupt and intere&s;ted wit|ne&s;&s;es, who a&s;&s;ert it to be fal&s;e. The very denial of &s;uch a people as the <HI>Jews</HI> is no mean pre&s;ump|tion in favour of the character of <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> Indeed, <HI>Mr. Paine</HI> pleads this cau&s;e with &s;o much ability in our favour and again&s;t him&s;elf, that I &s;hould be unpardonable in with-holding the next paragraph, replete with cogency and good &s;en&s;e, from the notice of the reader.</P>
<P><Q>That &s;uch a per&s;on as Je&s;us Chri&s;t exi&s;ted, and that he was crucified, which was the mode of execution at that day, are hi&s;torical relations &s;trictly within the limits of probability. He preached mo&s;t excellent morality, and the equa|lity of man; but he preached al&s;o again&s;t the
<PB N="33" REF="36">corruptions and avarice of the Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts; and this brought upon him the hatred and ven|geance of the whole order of the prie&s;t-hood.</Q></P>
<P>In the following pages, from p. 13 to p. 21, <HI>Mr. Paine</HI> enters into what he calls <Q>a bold in|ve&s;tigation, and which, he apprehends, will alarm many.</Q> Upon this topic of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion our au|thor fancies him&s;elf, no doubt, extremely eloquent; and, in&s;tead of plain &s;en&s;ible <HI>Thomas Paine,</HI> he commences a tumid and hypertragical declaimer. A mo&s;t formidable and pompous repre&s;entation is exhibited of the <HI>devil;</HI> with a detail of the battles, the transformations, the impri&s;onment, and other &s;trange adventures of his <HI>Satanic</HI> maje&s;ty. All this, I grant, may &s;well into a &s;erious difficulty with good <HI>churchmen</HI> and puritanical fanatics, but to my&s;elf, and others of the &s;ame orthodox &s;tandard, occa&s;ion no embarra&s;&s;ment at all, being received with exactly the degree of credit vouch&s;afed them by <HI>Thomas Paine</HI> him&s;elf. The whole fable of the <HI>Devil</HI> and his angels, with all it's terrific appen|dages, has been gratuitou&s;ly fabricated by the &s;ons of &s;uper&s;tition from one or two emblematical pa&s;|&s;ages in the <HI>Revelations,</HI> where the author has de|lineated future characters and events under the gui&s;e of the&s;e fictitious per&s;onages. No legiti|mate rules of interpretation, and no circum&s;tances
<PB N="34" REF="37">of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> or <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> &s;y&s;tems, make it nece&s;|&s;ary for us to regard the <HI>Devil,</HI> or <HI>Satan,</HI> in any other light than that of an <HI>allegorical character.</HI> This mode of <HI>per&s;onification</HI> was perfectly &s;uited to the ta&s;te of the <HI>orientals;</HI> who delighted in &s;peak|ing, not only in &s;triking metaphors, but by <HI>actions;</HI> and who&s;e compo&s;itions are a ti&s;&s;ue of figurative and emblematical expre&s;&s;ion. The origin of evil, moral and natural, is a problem, which has exer|ci&s;ed the ingenuity of man, &s;ince the creation of the world; and the <HI>Hebrews</HI> relieved the di&s;tre&s;s of mind, re&s;ulting from the&s;e di&s;qui&s;itions, by per|&s;onifying the <HI>evil principle</HI> under the denomina|tion of <HI>Satan,</HI> or the <HI>enemy.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> al&s;o had recour&s;e to a &s;imilar contrivance for their &s;atisfac|tion on this point; and employed <HI>Ate,</HI> the <HI>Furies,</HI> and other malignant deities, as convenient &s;ub&s;ti|tutes for <HI>the origin of evil</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Homer's Iliad, xix. 87, 91.</NOTE>.

<P><Q>The&s;e books, beginning with Gene&s;is and ending with Revelations (which by the bye is a book of riddles that requires a Revelation to explain it) are, we are told, the word of God.</Q></P>
<P>The vindicator, who occupies him&s;elf in the confutation of &s;uch un&s;upported and dogmatical a&s;&s;ertions, is not much more excu&s;able, than the <HI>ignoramus,</HI> who has the audacity to produce them. I thus expre&s;s my&s;elf with unre&s;erved cen&s;ure, upon a probability of the highe&s;t kind, that <HI>Mr. Paine</HI> never &s;tudied the <HI>apocalyp&s;e</HI> with an expre&s;s view of deciding upon the authenticity of that &s;in|gular compo&s;ition.

<PB N="36" REF="39">&s;uch incomparable &s;kill and clearne&s;s by <HI>Jo&s;eph Mede,</HI> carry with them to every di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate exa|miner, it will then be proper and &s;ea&s;onable to di&s;|cu&s;s the allegations of our dei&s;t. But that the random fiction of a di&s;tempered brain &s;hould be marked with &s;uch characters of truth, as are found on the face of the <HI>apocalyp&s;e,</HI> is to me perfectly inconceivable.</P>
<P><Q>When the church mythologi&s;ts e&s;tabli&s;hed their &s;y&s;tem, they collected all the writings they could find, and managed them as they plea&s;ed. It is a matter altogether of uncertainty to us whether &s;uch of the writings as now appear, under the name of the Old and the New Te&s;ta|ment, are in the &s;ame &s;tate in which tho&s;e col|lectors &s;ay they found them; or whether they added, altered, abridged, or dre&s;&s;ed them up.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Be this as it may, they decided by <HI>vote</HI> which of the books out of the collection they had made, &s;hould be the WORD OF GOD, and which &s;hould not. They rejected &s;everal; they voted others to be doubtful, &s;uch as the books called the Apocrypha; and tho&s;e books which had a majority of votes, were voted to be the word of God. Had they voted otherwi&s;e, all the peo|ple, &s;ince calling them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, had be|lieved
<PB N="37" REF="40">otherwi&s;e; for the belief of the one comes from the vote of the other. Who the people were that did all this, we know nothing of; they called them&s;elves by the general name of the church; and this is all we know of the matter.</Q></P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this undige&s;ted and inaccurate &s;tate|ment of the ca&s;e, I ob&s;erve, as follows: It is mo&s;t certain, and ought not to be di&s;&s;embled, that <HI>all</HI> the books of the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Testaments</HI> have not come confirmed to us by the &s;ame degree of evi|dence. They may be properly di&s;tributed into two cla&s;&s;es, Books of <HI>Fact,</HI> and Books of <HI>Opinion.</HI> Under the former cla&s;s I would compri&s;e from <HI>Ge|ne&s;is</HI> to the book of <HI>Job,</HI> with the <HI>Go&s;pels</HI> and <HI>Acts</HI> of the <HI>Apostles;</HI> and under the latter, to make the large&s;t conce&s;&s;ion to this argument, the <HI>Hagio|grapha</HI> and <HI>Prophets,</HI> i. e. all the remainder of the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> with the <HI>Epistles</HI> and <HI>Apocalyp&s;e</HI> of the <HI>New.</HI> Now, that we may wave all di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the evidences and importance of the latter col|lection, the <HI>Christian</HI> and <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;y&s;tems need no &s;upport beyond the authenticity of the <HI>historic</HI> cla&s;s: and I a&s;&s;ert in the fulle&s;t confidence, and appeal to a multitude of publications in behalf of this a&s;&s;ertion, that no hi&s;tory whatever, taking it's antiquity into con&s;ideration, has more claims to be
<PB N="38" REF="41">received as genuine, than the hi&s;tories in que&s;tion. And what need of circum&s;tantial detail in repelling the objections of men, who really know ju&s;t nothing of the &s;ubject, and &s;atisfy their <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>philo|&s;ophy</HI> by peremptory a&s;&s;everation only, unillumi|nated by one &s;ingle ray of information on the topic in di&s;pute
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have long had in contemplation a work relative to the authen|ticity of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> &s;imilar to my <HI>Evidences of Chri&s;tianity;</HI> which I hope &s;ome day to execute.</NOTE>?

<P>I agree with <HI>Thomas Paine,</HI> that <Q>the account of the creation, with which the book of Gene&s;is

<P><Q>If we permit our&s;elves to conceive right ideas of things, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily affix the idea, not only of unchangeablene&s;s, but of the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of any change taking place, by any means or accident whatever, in that which we would honour with the name of the word of God; and therefore the word of God cannot exi&s;t in any written or human language.</Q></P>
<P>What can be more frivolous, and more unwor|thy of a man of &s;en&s;e? A revelation, we &s;up|po&s;e, is fir&s;t conveyed to a particular per&s;on; he propo&s;es it with the proofs of his mi&s;&s;ion to others; they tran&s;mit the &s;ame by tradition and written records to their po&s;terity. It is acknowledged, that no &s;ucceeding evidence to future generations can &s;trictly authorize that mo&s;t indubitable con|viction of the fir&s;t immediate profe&s;&s;or; but even <HI>their</HI> evidence may approximate to certainty be|yond any a&s;&s;ignable limits, &s;o as to amount to a &s;pecies of per&s;ua&s;ion, from a concurrence of corroborating particulars, which is morally irre|&s;i&s;tible. Who, even at this day, can be a&s;&s;ured, that <HI>Michael Angelo</HI> planned the fabric of <HI>St. Peter's</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> or <HI>Sir Chri&s;topher Wren, St. Paul's</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="49">in <HI>London,</HI> with a &s;atisfaction equal to that of the contemporaries of the&s;e tran&s;actions? And yet, what man in his &s;en&s;es entertains the lea&s;t doubt of the&s;e re&s;pective facts? And &s;o it <HI>may be</HI> with re&s;pect to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> revelations; and &s;o it <HI>is,</HI> notwith&s;tanding any arguments of <HI>Mr. Paine.</HI> A few mi&s;takes of copyi&s;ts and prin|ters make no more alteration in the <HI>general</HI> effect of this argument, than a new &s;tone, or pinnacle repaired, will be deemed to aboli&s;h the preten&s;ions of the primary architect to his &s;tructure.</P>
<P><Q>I now go on to the book called the New Te&s;tament. The <HI>new</HI> Te&s;tament! that is, the <HI>new</HI> Will, as if there could be two wills of the Creator.</Q></P>
<P>Scarcely a &s;ingle <HI>Christian</HI> can be found, I be|lieve, &s;o totally ignorant and untutored, as not to know, that the <HI>New Covenant</HI> is the proper title of this book. Mo&s;t completely ridiculous then does <HI>Mr. Paine</HI> make him&s;elf by his &s;erious con|te&s;t with vulgar and exploded errors. A plain demon&s;tration this, how little of what is new and important <HI>he</HI> has to bring forward on the&s;e long agitated di&s;qui&s;itions.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="50">From p. 33 to 36, not an <HI>iota</HI> of remark is to be di&s;covered, that does not di&s;grace the meane&s;t under&s;tanding: and no objection, that a &s;chool-boy could not confute. My countrymen mu&s;t be degenerated into a <HI>&s;wini&s;h multitude</HI> indeed, to find any nutriment in &s;uch a me&s;s of pigs-meat, as the&s;e wretched caterers <HI>David Andrews</HI> and <HI>Thomas Paine</HI> have provided for them. But what better can be expected from <HI>zeal</HI> without <HI>knowledge?</HI> Nothing indeed, but dogmati&s;m, mi&s;|repre&s;entation, non&s;en&s;e, and ob&s;curity. In &s;hort, to employ our author's own words in p. 38. <Q>I become &s;o tired with examining into the in|con&s;i&s;tencies and ab&s;urdities of <HI>Thomas Paine's</HI> effu&s;ion, that I ha&s;ten to the conclu&s;ion of it, in order to proceed,</Q> but on very unpromi&s;ing &s;peculation of &s;ucce&s;s, "to &s;omething better."</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t true, as our author a&s;&s;erts in p. 40, <Q>The church has &s;et up a &s;y&s;tem of religion very contradictory to the character of the per&s;on who&s;e name it bears. It has &s;et up a religion of pomp and of revenue in pretended imita|tion of a per&s;on who&s;e life was humility and poverty:</Q> yet, according to the &s;tale but ju&s;t maxim, who&s;e dictates <HI>Mr. Paine</HI> has &s;o ince&s;|&s;antly and egregiou&s;ly violated in this crude production; <Q><HI>ab abu&s;u ad u&s;um non valet con&s;e|quentia:</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="51"><HI>quentia:</HI></Q> the&s;e <HI>corruptions</HI> are not chargeable on the &s;pirit of <HI>true chri&s;tianity:</HI> the argument will not infer from <HI>perverted revelation</HI> to <HI>no revela|tion</HI> at all. No: there are, we tru&s;t, &s;uch things in being, as <HI>truth, philo&s;ophy,</HI> and <HI>revealed religion,</HI> in &s;pite of <HI>lying Chroniclers, imaginary &s;y&s;tem|mongers,</HI> and <HI>meretricious theologians.</HI></P>
<P>Your notion of <HI>redemption,</HI> upon which you &s;o largely expatiate and &s;o tragically declaim in the following pages, is the notion derived probably from your <HI>quaker</HI> father and the good fraternity, among whom you received your education: but is not the notion of the &s;criptures. Our doc|trine is, that God created man pure and upright, with a capacity of conforming him&s;elf in all re&s;|pects to the injunctions of the divine will
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So <HI>Solomon.</HI> <Q>Lo! this only have I found; that God hath made man upright, but they have &s;ought out many inventors.</Q> Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, vii. 29.</NOTE>: that life without ce&s;&s;ation was the propo&s;ed reward of unfailing obedience; and death the puni&s;hment of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Man deviated from the line of rec|titude, by li&s;tening to the &s;eductions of wayward appetite; and became ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to the penalty denounced again&s;t &s;in. His heavenly father, who in the mid&s;t of judgement remembers mercy, and
<PB N="49" REF="52">delights, through the whole conduct of his pro|vidential admini&s;trations to mankind, in educing good from evil, renews his covenant with his fallen creatures; promi&s;es to rever&s;e this &s;entence of death, and to re-e&s;tabli&s;h him in his claim to immortality by means of another di&s;pen&s;ation at a future &s;ea&s;on, which appeared to divine wi&s;dom the be&s;t calculated for it's promulgation. Ac|cordingly, in the fulne&s;s of time, after a prepara|tory &s;y&s;tem, who&s;e chief object was the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a belief in one God, in oppo&s;ition to the corruptions of idol-wor&s;hip; <HI>Je&s;us</HI> of <HI>Nazareth</HI> was commi&s;&s;ioned to preach in <HI>Judea</HI> the terms of acceptance with the Almighty. The&s;e were, a belief and practice of the doctrines, which this apo&s;tle preached, and confirmed by miracles: the doctrines of unbounded mercy on the part of God upon repentance and reformation, and of univer|&s;al undi&s;tingui&s;hing benevolence on the part of man to all his brethren of the human race: prin|ciples e&s;&s;ential in them&s;elves to the virtue and happine&s;s of mankind; and therefore required as the conditions of divine favour, by this &s;y&s;tem of revelation. Thus was the ine&s;timable privilege of immortality again indulged to the world; and <HI>Je&s;us</HI> him&s;elf was propounded as the <HI>voucher</HI> of this truth. Hence manife&s;tly appears the rea|&s;on,
<PB N="50" REF="53">why, he did not <Q>die of a fever, or of the &s;mall-pox, of old age
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 36, of <HI>Mr. Paine's</HI> Pamphlet.</NOTE>,</Q> or in any private cu&s;tomary manner; but by a public exhibition of death upon a cro&s;s: that he, who&s;e re&s;urrection had been previou&s;ly appointed by him&s;elf for the te&s;t and demon&s;tration of the whole <HI>chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem</HI> as it related to the de&s;truction of death and the gift of immortality, might be &s;hown to the world unequivocally and indubitably <HI>dead</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Remark, xliii. in my evidences of <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI> Had <HI>Je&s;us</HI> died in any of the ways pointed out by the wi&s;dom of <HI>Mr. Paine,</HI> we &s;hould have been called upon to clear the &s;u&s;picions of collu&s;ion and impo&s;ture from the privacy of that event.</NOTE>. This may be regarded as a brief ab&s;tract of the <HI>evangelical</HI> &s;cheme of redemption according to my conception of it; a &s;cheme, which admits of abundant illu&s;tration and e&s;tabli&s;hment from a multiplicity of con&s;iderations, conformable alike to rea&s;on, philo&s;ophy, and experience: but nei|ther does the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion permit, nor the weight of <HI>Mr. Paine's</HI> objections require, a more copious di&s;play or a more &s;crupulous corrobo|ration of our creed.</P>
<P>In page 46, you &s;ay, <Q>Je&s;us Chri&s;t could &s;peak but one language, which was Hebrew,</Q> with as much confidence, as if you had been per&s;onally ac|quainted
<PB N="51" REF="54">with him. Now my opinion is, that the inhabitants of <HI>Judea,</HI> and the greater part of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire, under&s;tood <HI>Greek</HI> al&s;o as well and generally as the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> but what claim have tho&s;e, who decide without know|ledge, to any &s;atisfaction on this point? My wi&s;h is to excite in the dei&s;tical lovers of truth a de&s;ire to examine for them&s;elves; a &s;ober e&s;timate of their own acquirements; and a mode&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion, that the di&s;ciples of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> may have <HI>&s;ome</HI> rea&s;ons, not wholly puerile and inefficient, for their attachment to their religion: and I recommend, in the mean time, to the con&s;ideration of the <HI>athei&s;t</HI> (if &s;uch men really exi&s;t; which I doubt exceedingly) what <HI>Mr. Paine</HI> advances in the 48th and following pages, and at the conclu&s;ion of his pamphlet. I know not, whether <HI>Mr. Paine's</HI> remarks on the languages of the ancients
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 65, and the following.</NOTE> can be thought worthy of any ani|madver&s;ion as we pa&s;s. I ob&s;erve, however, that as all men have not that docility and humility of mind, which is e&s;&s;ential to an acceptance of <HI>Chri&s;ti|anity,</HI> but wrap them&s;elves up in a cloak of igno|rance and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency; &s;o neither have all that &s;en&s;ibility of perception, and that elegance of ta&s;te, which is nece&s;&s;ary to a reli&s;h of the inimitable beau|ties of ancient compo&s;ition. I may be, for exam|ple, a delicate bird, delighting in &s;trawberries and
<PB N="52" REF="55">the choice&s;t fruits: <HI>Thomas Paine,</HI> a crow; who prefers a fea&s;t on carrion and putre&s;cence. The genius and faculties of men are diver&s;ified with in finite &s;hades of texture: and it &s;eems to be the duty of every individual to pro&s;ecute that branch of literature, with peculiar devotion, for which na|ture has peculiarly fitted him. Poetical in&s;pira|tion and the powers of eloquence were not given by God without &s;ome wi&s;e intention, with re&s;pect both to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or and mankind at large. <Q>Nec tua laudabis &s;tudia aut aliena reprendes:</Q> is a &s;en&s;ible and valuable maxim of an <HI>Augu&s;tan</HI> poet. The compo&s;itions of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Ro|mans</HI> &s;tand as yet unrivalled in the univer&s;e; and their admirers are much confirmed in their attach|ment, when they perceive their cen&s;urers to be tho&s;e, who know little, or nothing, of the &s;ubject them&s;elves, and &s;cruple not to incur an imputa|tion of mo&s;t contemptible impertinence for &s;o ir|rational an interpo&s;ition of their judgement. Be|&s;ides, I have not yet di&s;covered, that the be&s;t phi|lologi&s;ts are generally inferior in any <HI>other</HI> branch of knowledge to the wi&s;e-acres, who undervalue the&s;e attainments, merely becau&s;e they have not the means of acqui&s;ition. Have the cultivators of the languages more natural powers therefore than other men? By no means: but their youth
<PB N="53" REF="56">has been happily exerci&s;ed in tho&s;e pur&s;uits, in which youth can only be occupied, very generally &s;peaking, with complete efficiency. In all that <HI>Mr. Paine</HI> has &s;aid on this &s;ubject, I di&s;cern little more than a collection of ignorance, mi&s;concep|tion, effrontery, and in&s;ipidity.</P>
<P><Q>The event that &s;erved more than any other, to break the fir&s;t link in this long chain of de&s;|potic ignorance, is that known by the name of the reformation by Luther. From that time, though it does not appear to have made any part of the intention of Luther, or of tho&s;e who are called reformers, the Sciences began to re|vive, and Liberality, their natural a&s;&s;ociate, be|gan to appear.</Q></P>
<P>The reformation aro&s;e from an in&s;ight into the corruptions and ab&s;urdities of Popery, in con&s;e|quence of a freedom of enquiry already commen|cing, and a &s;teady conviction of &s;ervility, di&s;|graceful to a rational being, in a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the under&s;tanding to the arbitrary dictates of a &s;piri|tual u&s;urper. The reformation, therefore, by <HI>Lu|ther</HI> was only one circum&s;tance in the recovery of the natural right of man, to think and determine for him&s;elf. But the benefits of the reformation were momentous and exten&s;ive; and particularly
<PB N="54" REF="57">by removing tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions of per&s;onal dan|ger, which debarred all progre&s;s to true philo&s;o|phy in countries, where the <HI>Papal</HI> domination was e&s;tabli&s;hed. And &s;urely it forms no mean pre|&s;umption in favour of the rea&s;onablene&s;s of reve|lation, that the re&s;toration of &s;cience and the recti|fication of religion &s;hould be congenial and con|temporary; that the beams of knowledge &s;hould di&s;pel the damps and darkne&s;s of ignorant &s;uper&s;ti|tion, but contribute illumination and vigour to the &s;incere go&s;pel of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> The mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed mathematicians and philo&s;ophers of our own country, <HI>Bacon, Boyle, Newton, Locke, Barrow,</HI> and <HI>Hartley,</HI> have been the firme&s;t believers of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> revelation: and not pa&s;&s;ive educational believers merely, accepting with implicit acqui|e&s;cence the traditionary creeds of their teachers; but &s;trenuous a&s;&s;ertors and mo&s;t able vindicators of the authority, the importance, and the rationality of the <HI>go&s;pel.</HI> I would recommend to the notice of <HI>Thomas Paine</HI> the following pa&s;&s;age in the life of <HI>Emlyn</HI>

<P><HI>Mr. Paine</HI> de&s;cants with a tolerable &s;hare of merriment, in page 109, on the &s;tory of <HI>Jonah</HI> and the <HI>Whale;</HI> which my own &s;tomach al&s;o feels an equal indi&s;po&s;ition to ingurgitate. It is not un|like a tale, that I lately heard; which many will think not inferior to that before us in &s;ymptoms of credibility. A little black-boy, a favourite with the &s;hip's company, as he was carele&s;sly &s;itting with his bread and chee&s;e, &s;uddenly fell overboard; and was in&s;tantly &s;wallowed by an immen&s;e &s;hark. Some &s;ailors, witne&s;&s;es of this cata&s;trophe, ex|claimed: "Cae&s;ar is devoured by a &s;hark." The captain immediately commanded a hook to be baited with a huge piece of beef; which the mon&s;|ter &s;eized at once with the utmo&s;t rapacity. He was drawn with difficulty upon deck; his tail cut off to prevent mi&s;chief; and the mo&s;t trembling precaution u&s;ed in opening his &s;tomach for fear of wounding it's ine&s;timable contents. But how great was their admiration and delight to di&s;cover little <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> perched on a tubercle of the purte|nance, di&s;patching his bread and chee&s;e in perfect compo&s;ure and &s;ecurity!</P>
<P>I have now fini&s;hed my remarks on this pamph|let of <HI>Thomas Paine;</HI> which have been extended
<PB N="56" REF="59">thus far, more in deference to the de&s;erved cele|brity of the name, than the powers of the di&s;putant: nor am I con&s;cious to my&s;elf of eluding any diffi|culty, or &s;hrinking from the terrors of a &s;ingle ar|gument, in the cour&s;e of this examination. To the be&s;t of my ability, a conci&s;e an&s;wer to every objec|tion, not completely puerile, has been &s;pecifically given, or is virtually included in this &s;eries of ob|&s;ervations. Nor, in conclu&s;ion, will I di&s;&s;emble one of my mo&s;t urgent inducements to this publi|cation to have been, an ambition to declare to my fellow-citizens in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved manner, that one in the mid&s;t of a general obloquy on reform|ers, as infidels and athei&s;ts, is indeed a zealous ad|vocate for <HI>Chri&s;tianity;</HI> but, as becomes the di&s;ci|ple of a <HI>lowly</HI> and pacific ma&s;ter, with as warm an enthu&s;ia&s;m for the univer&s;al equality and the una|lienable rights of man, as ever actuated the brea&s;t even of the "hallowed MILTON." The more perilous the times, with the more animation will a genuine votary of a crucified Saviour, who "looks for a better country, that is, a heavenly
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hebrews, xi. 16.</NOTE>," feel him&s;elf impelled to a bold and open profe&s;|&s;ion of the practical principles of his religion; the principles of LOVE and PEACE and LIBERTY, without di&s;tinction, to the whole human race.
