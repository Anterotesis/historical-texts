<HEAD><HI>TO WILLIAM LOCK, <ABBR>ESQ</ABBR> OF</HI> NORBURY-PARK, <HI>in</HI> SURREY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following e&s;&s;ays, and poem, I beg leave to in&s;cribe to you. Indeed I do little more, than return your own: for the be&s;t remarks, and ob&s;ervations in them, are yours. Such as may be cavilled at, I am per&s;uaded, mu&s;t be mine.</P>
<P>A publi&s;hed work is certainly a fair object of critici&s;m: but I think, my dear &s;ir, we picture&s;que people are a little mi&s;under&s;tood with regard to our <HI>general intention.</HI> I have
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
&s;everal times been &s;urprized at finding us repre&s;ented, as &s;uppo&s;ing, <HI>all beauty</HI> to con&s;i&s;t in <HI>picture&s;que beauty</HI>&mdash;and the face of nature to be examined <HI>only by the rules of painting.</HI> Whereas, in fact, we always &s;peak a different language. We &s;peak of the grand &s;cenes of nature, tho unintere&s;ting in a <HI>picture&s;que light,</HI> as having a &s;trong effect on the imagination&mdash; often a &s;tronger, than when they are pro|perly di&s;po&s;ed for the pencil. We every where make a di&s;tinction between &s;cenes, that are <HI>beautiful,</HI> and <HI>amu&s;ing;</HI> and &s;cenes that are <HI>picture&s;que.</HI> We examine, and admire both. Even artificial objects we admire, whether in a grand, or in a humble &s;tile, tho unconnected with picture&s;que beauty&mdash;the palace, and the cottage&mdash;the improved garden-&s;cene, and the neat home&s;tall. Works of tillage al&s;o afford us equal delight&mdash;the plough, the mower, the reaper, the hay-field, and the harve&s;t-wane. In a word, we reverence, and admire the works of God; and look with benevolence, and plea&s;ure, on the works of men.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="4">In what then do we offend? At the expence of no other &s;pecies of beauty, we merely en|deavour to illu&s;trate, and recommend <HI>one</HI> &s;pecies more; which, tho among the mo&s;t intere&s;ting, hath never yet, &s;o far as I know, been made the &s;et object of inve&s;tigation. From &s;cenes indeed of the <HI>picture&s;que kind</HI> we exclude the appendages of tillage, and in general the works of men; which too often introduce preci&s;ene&s;s, and formality. But ex|cluding artificial objects from one &s;pecies of beauty, is not degrading them from all. We leave then the general admirer of the beauties of nature to his own pur&s;uits; nay we admire them with him: all we de&s;ire, is, that he would leave us as quietly in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>Under this apology, my dear &s;ir, I have ventured, in the following e&s;&s;ays, to inlarge a little both on our theory, and practice. In the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay (that we may be fairly under|&s;tood) the <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic</HI> is marked,
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
of <HI>&s;uch beautiful objects,</HI> as are &s;uited to the pencil. In the &s;econd, the mode of amu&s;e|ment is pointed out, that may ari&s;e from viewing the &s;cenes of nature in a picture&s;que light: and in the third, a few rules are given for &s;ketching land&s;cape after nature. I have practi&s;ed drawing as an amu&s;ement, and re|laxation, for many years; and here offer the re&s;ult of my experience. Some readine&s;s in <HI>execution</HI> indeed, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, is nece&s;&s;ary, before the&s;e rules can be of much &s;ervice. They mean to take the young arti&s;t up, where the drawing-ma&s;ter leaves him.&mdash;I have only to add farther, that as &s;everal of the rules, and principles here laid down, have been touched in different picture&s;que works, which I have given the public, I have endeavoured not to repeat my&s;elf: and where I could not throw new light on a &s;ubject, I have ha&s;tened over it:&mdash;only in a work of this kind, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to bring all my principles together.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="6">With regard to the poem, annexed to the&s;e e&s;&s;ays, &s;omething more &s;hould be &s;aid. As that &s;mall part of the public, who per&s;onally know me; and that &s;till &s;maller part, whom I have the honour to call my friends, may think me guilty of pre&s;umption in attempting a work of this kind, I beg leave to give the following hi&s;tory of it.</P>
<P>Several years ago, I amu&s;ed my&s;elf with writing a few lines in ver&s;e on land&s;cape-painting; and afterwards &s;ent them, as a frag|ment (for they were not fini&s;hed) to amu&s;e a friend.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edward For&s;ter <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of Waltham&s;tow.</NOTE> I had no other purpo&s;e. My friend told me, he could not &s;ay much for my <HI>poetry;</HI> but as my <HI>rules,</HI> he thought, were good, he wi&s;hed me to fini&s;h my frag|ment; and if I &s;hould not like it as a <HI>poem,</HI> I might turn it into an <HI>e&s;&s;ay in pro&s;e.</HI>&mdash;As this was only what I expected, I was not di&s;ap|pointed; tho not encouraged to proceed. So
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
I troubled my head no farther with my ver&s;es.</P>
<P>Some time after, another friend,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. Mr. Ma&s;on.</NOTE> finding fault with my mode of de&s;cribing the lakes, and mountains of Cumberland, and We&s;tmore|land, as too poetical, I told him the fate of my fragment; lamenting the hard&s;hip of my ca&s;e&mdash;when I wrote ver&s;e, one friend called it pro&s;e; and when I wrote pro&s;e, another friend called it ver&s;e. In his next letter he de&s;ired to &s;ee my ver&s;es; and being plea&s;ed with the &s;ubject, he offered, if I would fini&s;h my poem (however carele&s;sly as to metrical exactne&s;s) he would adju&s;t the ver&s;ification. But he found, he had engaged in a more arduous affair, than he expected. My rules, and tecnical terms were &s;tubborn, and would not ea&s;ily glide into ver&s;e; and I was as &s;tub|born, as they, and would not relinqui&s;h the &s;cientific part for the poetry. My friend's
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
good-nature therefore generally gave way, and &s;uffered many lines to &s;tand, and many altera|tions to be made, which his own good ta&s;te could not approve.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Extract of a letter from Mr. Ma&s;on.</P>
<Q>&mdash;I have in&s;erted con&s;cientiou&s;ly every word, and phra&s;e, you have altered; except the awkward word <HI>clump,</HI> which I have uniformly di&s;carded, whenever it offered it&s;elf to me in my Engli&s;h garden, which you may imagine it did frequently: in it's &s;tead I have always u&s;ed <HI>tuft.</HI> I have ventured therefore to in&s;ert it adjectively; and I hope, I &s;hall be forgiven.

<HEAD>EXPLANATION OF THE <HI>PRINTS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TWO facing page 19. It is the intention of the&s;e two prints to illu&s;trate how very adver&s;e the idea of <HI>&s;moothne&s;s</HI> is to the <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> of land&s;cape. In the &s;econd of them the <HI>great lines</HI> of the land&s;cape are exactly the &s;ame as in the fir&s;t; only they are <HI>more broken.</HI></P>
<P>Two facing p. 75. The fir&s;t of the&s;e prints is meant to illu&s;trate the idea of <HI>&s;imple illumi|nation.</HI> The light falls &s;trongly on <HI>various</HI> parts; as indeed it often does in nature. But, as it is the painter's bu&s;ine&s;s to take nature in her mo&s;t beautiful form, he chu&s;es to throw his light more into a <HI>ma&s;s,</HI> as re|pre&s;ented in the &s;econd print, which exhi|bits the <HI>&s;ame land&s;cape,</HI> only better inlight|ened. When we merely take the <HI>lines</HI> of a land&s;cape from nature; and <HI>inlighten</HI> it
<PB N="ii" REF="11">
(as we mu&s;t often do) from our own ta&s;te, and judgment, the ma&s;&s;ing of the light mu&s;t be well attended to, as one of the great &s;ources of beauty. It mu&s;t not be &s;cattered in &s;pots; but mu&s;t be brought more together, as on the rocky &s;ide of the hill in the &s;econd print: and yet it mu&s;t graduate al&s;o in different parts; &s;o as not to appear affected.</P>
<P>One print facing p. 77. The idea of <HI>gradation</HI> is here farther illu&s;trated; according to the explanation in p. 76. &mdash; The in&s;cription is that admired one of Caecilia Metella, the daughter of Metellus, and the wife of Cra&s;&s;us; in which, with &s;o much elegant, and tender &s;implicity, her name is divided between her father, and her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>One facing p. 79. This print exemplifies a <HI>&s;imple mode</HI> of <HI>tinting</HI> a drawing, as explained in the text. The colouring of this print (which is done by hand) has added a little to the expence of the book: but it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to compleat the &s;cheme. &mdash;It was coloured by a relation of mine; Mr. Gilpin, drawing-ma&s;ter at Paddington-green; who in all the copies I have &s;een, has illu&s;trated my ideas very &s;atisfactorily; and who, as far as the recommendation of a partial kin&s;man may go, de&s;erves mine.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY I. ON PICTURESQUE BEAUTY.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB REF="14">ESSAY I.</HEAD>
<P>DISPUTES about beauty might perhaps be involved in le&s;s confu&s;ion, if a di&s;tinction were e&s;tabli&s;hed, which certainly exi&s;ts, between &s;uch objects as are <HI>beautiful,</HI> and &s;uch as are <HI>picture&s;que</HI>&mdash;between tho&s;e, which plea&s;e the eye in their <HI>natural &s;tate;</HI> and tho&s;e, which plea&s;e from &s;ome quality, capable of being <HI>illu&s;trated in painting.</HI></P>
<P>Ideas of beauty vary with the object, and with the eye of the &s;pectator. Tho&s;e arti|ficial forms appear generally the mo&s;t beau|tiful, with which we have been the mo&s;t conver&s;ant. Thus the &s;tone-ma&s;on &s;ees beau|ties in a well-jointed wall, which e&s;cape the architect, who &s;urveys the building under a different idea. And thus the painter, who
<PB N="4" REF="15">
compares his object with the rules of his art, &s;ees it in a different light from the man of general ta&s;te, who &s;urveys it only as &s;imply beautiful.</P>
<P>As this difference therefore between the <HI>beau|tiful,</HI> and the <HI>picture&s;que</HI> appears really to exi&s;t, and mu&s;t depend on &s;ome peculiar con&s;truction of the object; it may be worth while to ex|amine, what that peculiar con&s;truction is. We inquire not into the <HI>general &s;ources of beauty,</HI> either in nature, or in repre&s;entation. This would lead into a nice, and &s;cientific di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, in which it is not our purpo&s;e to engage. The que&s;tion &s;imply is, <HI>What is that quality in objects, which particularly marks them as picture&s;que?</HI></P>
<P>In examining the <HI>real object,</HI> we &s;hall find, one &s;ource of beauty ari&s;es from that &s;pecies of elegance, which we call <HI>&s;moothne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>neatne&s;s;</HI> for the terms are nearly &s;ynonymous. The higher the marble is poli&s;hed, the brighter the &s;ilver is rubbed, and the more the maho|gany &s;hines, the more each is con&s;idered as an object of beauty: as if the eye delighted in gliding &s;moothly over a &s;urface.</P>
<P>In the cla&s;s of larger objects the &s;ame idea prevails. In a pile of building we wi&s;h to
<PB N="5" REF="16">
&s;ee neatne&s;s in every part added to the elegance of the architecture. And if we examine a piece of improved plea&s;ure-ground, every thing rough, and &s;lovenly offends.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, enumerating the properties of beauty, con&s;iders <HI>&s;moothne&s;s</HI> as one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential. "A very con&s;iderable part of the effect of beauty, &s;ays he, is owing to this quality: indeed the mo&s;t con&s;iderable: for take any beautiful object, and give it a broken, and rugged &s;urface, and however well-formed it may be in other re&s;pects, it plea&s;es no longer. Whereas, let it want ever &s;o many of the other con&s;tituents, if it want not this, it becomes more plea&s;ing, than almo&s;t all the others without it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon the &s;ublime and beautiful, p. 213.</NOTE>&mdash; How far Mr. Burke may be right in making &s;moothne&s;s the <HI>mo&s;t con&s;iderable</HI> &s;ource of beauty, I rather doubt<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Burke is probably not very accurate in what he farther &s;ays on the connection between <HI>beauty,</HI> and <HI>diminutives.</HI> &mdash;Beauty excites love; and a loved object is generally characterized by diminutives. But it does not follow, that all objects characterized by diminutives, tho they may be &s;o
<PB N="6" REF="17">becau&s;e they are loved, are therefore beautiful. We often love them for their moral qualities; their affections; their gentlene&s;s; or their docility. Beauty, no doubt, awakens love; but it al&s;o excites admiration, and re&s;pect. This com|bination forms the &s;entiment, which prevails, when we look at the Apollo of Belvidere, and the Niobe. No man of nice di&s;cernment would characterize the&s;e &s;tatues by diminu|tives. &mdash;There is then a beauty, between which and dimi|nutives there is no relation; but which, on the contrary, excludes them: and in the de&s;cription of figures, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that &s;pecies of beauty, we &s;eek for terms, which recommend them more to our <HI>admiration,</HI> than our <HI>love.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="16"></NOTE>. A con&s;iderable one it cer|tainly is.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="17">Thus then, we &s;uppo&s;e, the matter &s;tands with regard to <HI>beautiful objects in general.</HI> But in <HI>picture&s;que repre&s;entation</HI> it &s;eems &s;omewhat odd, yet we &s;hall perhaps find it equally true, that the rever&s;e of this is the ca&s;e; and that the ideas of <HI>neat</HI> and <HI>&s;mooth,</HI> in&s;tead of being picture&s;que, in fact di&s;qualify the object, in which they re&s;ide, from any pre|ten&s;ions to <HI>picture&s;que beauty.</HI>&mdash;Nay farther, we do not &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>roughne&s;s</HI> forms the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential point of difference between the <HI>beautiful,</HI> and the <HI>picture&s;que;</HI> as it &s;eems to be that particular quality, which makes objects chiefly plea&s;ing in paint|ing.&mdash;I u&s;e the general term <HI>roughne&s;s;</HI> but properly &s;peaking roughne&s;s relates only to
<PB N="7" REF="18">
the &s;urfaces of bodies: when we &s;peak of their delineation, we u&s;e the word <HI>ruggedne&s;s.</HI> Both ideas however equally enter into the picture&s;que; and both are ob&s;ervable in the &s;maller, as well as in the larger parts of nature&mdash;in the outline, and bark of a tree, as in the rude &s;ummit, and craggy &s;ides of a mountain.</P>
<P>Let us then examine our theory by an ap|peal to experience; and try how far the&s;e qualities enter into the idea of <HI>picture&s;que beauty;</HI> and how far they mark that dif|ference among objects, which is the ground of our inquiry.</P>
<P>A piece of Palladian architecture may be elegant in the la&s;t degree. The proportion of it's parts&mdash;the propriety of it's ornaments&mdash;and the &s;ymmetry of the whole, may be highly plea|&s;ing. But if we introduce it in a picture, it immediately becomes a formal object, and cea&s;es to plea&s;e. Should we wi&s;h to give it picture&s;que beauty, we mu&s;t u&s;e the mallet, in&s;tead of the chi&s;&s;el: we mu&s;t beat down one half of it, deface the other, and throw the mutilated members around in heaps. In &s;hort, from a <HI>&s;mooth</HI> building we mu&s;t turn it into a
<PB N="8" REF="19">
<HI>rough</HI> ruin. No painter, who had the choice of the two objects, would he&s;itate a moment.</P>
<P>Again, why does an elegant piece of garden-ground make no figure on canvas? The &s;hape is plea&s;ing; the combination of the objects, harmonious; and the winding of the walk in the very line of beauty. All this is true; but the <HI>&s;moothne&s;s</HI> of the whole, tho right, and as it &s;hould be in nature, offends in picture. Turn the lawn into a piece of broken ground: plant rugged oaks in&s;tead of flowering &s;hrubs: break the edges of the walk: give it the rude|ne&s;s of a road: mark it with wheel-tracks; and &s;catter around a few &s;tones, and bru&s;h-wood; in a word, in&s;tead of making the whole <HI>&s;mooth,</HI> make it <HI>rough;</HI> and you make it al&s;o <HI>picture&s;que.</HI> All the other ingredients of beauty it already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>You &s;it for your picture. The ma&s;ter, at your de&s;ire, paints your head combed &s;mooth, and powdered from the barber's hand. This may give it a more &s;triking likene&s;s, as it is more the re&s;emblance of the real object. But is it therefore a more plea&s;ing picture? I fear not. Leave Reynolds to him&s;elf, and he will make it picture&s;que: he will throw the hair di&s;hevelled about your &s;houlders. Virgil would
<PB N="9" REF="20">
have done the &s;ame. It was his u&s;ual practice in all his portraits. In his figure of A&s;canius, we have the <HI>fu&s;os crines;</HI> and in his portrait of Venus, which is highly fini&s;hed in every part, the arti&s;t has given her hair, <Q>&mdash; diffundere ventis.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The roughne&s;s, which Virgil gives the hair of Venus, and A&s;canius, we may &s;uppo&s;e to be of a different kind from the &s;qualid roughne&s;s, which he attributes to Charon:
<Q><L>Portitor has horrendus aquas, et flumina &s;ervat</L>
<L>Terribili &s;qualore Charon, cui plurima mento</L>
<L>Canities inculta jacet. &mdash;</L></Q>
Charon's roughne&s;s is, in it's kind, picture&s;que al&s;o; but the roughne&s;s here intended, and which can only be introduced in elegant figures, is of that kind, which is merely oppo&s;ed to hair in nice order. In de&s;cribing Venus, Virgil probably thought hair, when <HI>&s;treaming in the wind,</HI> both beautiful, and picture&s;que, from it's undulating form, and varied tints; and from a kind of life, which it a&s;&s;umes in motion; tho perhaps it's chief recommendation to him, at the moment, was, that it was a feature of the character, which Venus was then a&s;&s;uming.</P></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>That lovely face of youth &s;miling with all it's &s;weet, dimpling charms, how attractive is it in life! how beautiful in repre&s;entation! It is one of tho&s;e objects, that plea&s;e, as many do, both in nature, and on canvas. But
<PB N="10" REF="21">
would you &s;ee the human face in it's highe&s;t form of <HI>picture&s;que beauty,</HI> examine that pa|triarchal head. What is it, which gives that dignity of character; that force of expre&s;&s;ion; tho&s;e lines of wi&s;dom, and experience; that energetic meaning, &s;o far beyond the ro&s;y hue, or even the bewitching &s;mile of youth? What is it, but the forehead furrowed with wrinkles? the prominent cheek-bone, catching the light? the mu&s;cles of the cheek &s;trongly marked, and lo&s;ing them&s;elves in the &s;haggy beard? and, above all, the au&s;tere brow, projecting over the eye&mdash;that feature which particularly &s;truck Homer in his idea of Jupiter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is much more probable, that the poet copied <HI>forms</HI> from the &s;culptor, who mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand them better, from having &s;tudied them more; than that the &s;culptor &s;hould copy them from the poet. Arti&s;ts however have taken advan|tage of the pre-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the world for Homer to &s;ecure approbation to their works by acknowledging them to be re|flected images of his conceptions. So Phidias a&s;&s;ured his countrymen, that he had taken his Jupiter from the de&s;cription of that god in the fir&s;t book of Homer. The fact is, none of the features contained in that image, except the brow, can be rendered by &s;culpture. But he knew what advantage &s;uch ideas, as his art could expre&s;s, would receive from being con|nected in the mind of the &s;pectator with tho&s;e furni&s;hed by poetry; and from the ju&s;t partiality of men for &s;uch a

<PB N="11" REF="22">
he had probably &s;een finely repre&s;ented in &s;ome &s;tatue? in a word, what is it, but the <HI>rough</HI> touches of age?</P>
<P>As an object of the mixed kind, partaking both of the <HI>beautiful,</HI> and the <HI>picture&s;que,</HI> we admire the human figure al&s;o. The lines, and &s;urface of a beautiful human form are &s;o in|finitely varied; the lights and &s;hades, which it receives, are &s;o exqui&s;itely tender in &s;ome parts, and yet &s;o round, and bold in others; it's proportions are &s;o ju&s;t; and it's limbs &s;o fitted to receive all the beauties of grace, and contra&s;t; that even the face, in which the charms of intelligence, and &s;en&s;ibility re&s;ide, is almo&s;t lo&s;t in the compari&s;on. But altho the human form, in a quie&s;cent &s;tate, is thus
<PB N="12" REF="23">
beautiful; yet the more it's <HI>&s;mooth &s;urface is ruffled,</HI> if I may &s;o &s;peak, the more pictu|re&s;que it appears. When it is agitated by pa&s;&s;ion, and it's mu&s;cles &s;woln by &s;trong ex|ertion, the whole frame is &s;hewn to the mo&s;t advantage.&mdash;But when we &s;peak of mu&s;cles &s;woln by exertion, we mean only natural exer|tions, not an affected di&s;play of anatomy, in which the mu&s;cles, tho ju&s;tly placed, may &s;till be overcharged.</P>
<P>It is true, we are better plea&s;ed with the u&s;ual repre&s;entations we meet with of the human form in a quie&s;cent &s;tate, than in an agitated one: but this is merely owing to our &s;eldom &s;eeing it naturally repre&s;ented in &s;trong action. Even among the be&s;t ma&s;ters we &s;ee little knowledge of anatomy. One will inflate the mu&s;cles violently to produce &s;ome trifling effect: another will &s;carce &s;well them in the production of a laboured one. The eye &s;oon learns to &s;ee a defect, tho unable to remedy it. But when the anatomy is perfectly ju&s;t, the human body will always be more picture&s;que in action, than at re&s;t. The great difficulty indeed of repre&s;enting &s;trong mu&s;cular motion, &s;eems to have &s;truck the ancient ma&s;ters of &s;culpture: for it is certainly much harder to
<PB N="13" REF="24">
model from a figure in &s;trong, momentary action, which mu&s;t, as it were, be &s;hot flying; than from one, &s;itting, or &s;tanding, which the arti&s;t may copy at lei&s;ure. Amid&s;t the variety of &s;tatues tran&s;mitted from their hands, we have only three, or four in very &s;pirited ac|tion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Tho there are only perhaps two or three of the fir&s;t an|tique &s;tatues in <HI>very &s;pirited</HI> action&mdash;the Laocoon, the fighting gladiator, and the boxers&mdash;yet there are &s;everal others, which are <HI>in action</HI>&mdash;the Apollo Belvidere&mdash;Michael Angelo's Tor&s;o&mdash; Arria and Paetus&mdash;the Pietas militaris, &s;ometimes called the Ajax, of which the Pa&s;quin at Rome is a part, and of which there is a repetition more intire, tho &s;till much mutilated, at Florence&mdash;the Alexander, and Bucephalus; and perhaps &s;ome others, which occur not to my memory. The paucity however of them, even if a longer catalogue could be produced, I think, &s;hews that the ancient &s;culptors con&s;idered the repre&s;entation of <HI>&s;pirited action</HI> as an atchievement. The moderns have been le&s;s daring in attempting it. But I believe connoi&s;&s;eurs univer&s;ally give the preference to tho&s;e &s;tatues, in which the great ma&s;ters have &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully exhibited animated action.</P></NOTE>
Yet when we &s;ee an effect of this kind well executed, our admiration is greatly in|crea&s;ed. Who does not admire the Laocoon more than the Antinous?</P>
<P>Animal life, as well as human, is, in gene|ral, beautiful both in nature, and on canvas. We admire the hor&s;e, as a <HI>real object;</HI> the elegance of his form; the &s;tateline&s;s of his
<PB N="14" REF="25">
tread; the &s;pirit of all his motions; and the glo&s;&s;ine&s;s of his coat. We admire him al&s;o in <HI>repre&s;entation.</HI> But as an object of pictu|re&s;que beauty, we admire more the worn-out cart-hor&s;e, the cow, the goat, or the a&s;s; who&s;e harder lines, and rougher coats, exhibit more the graces of the pencil. For the truth of this we may examine Berghem's pictures: we may examine the &s;mart touch of Ro&s;a of Tivoli. The lion with his rough mane; the bri&s;tly boar; and the ruffled plumage of the eagle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The idea of the <HI>ruffled plumage of the eagle</HI> is taken from the celebrated eagle of Pindar, in his fir&s;t Pythian ode; which has exerci&s;ed the pens of &s;everal poets; and is equally poetical, and picture&s;que. He is introduced as an in&s;tance of the power of mu&s;ic. In Gray's ode on the progre&s;s of poe&s;y we have the following picture of him.
<Q><L>Perching on the &s;ceptered hand</L>
<L>Of Jove, thy magic lulls the feathered king</L>
<L>With ruffled plumes, and flagging wing:</L>
<L>Quenched in dark clouds of &s;lumber lie</L>
<L>The terror of his beak, and lightening of his eye.</L></Q>
Aken&s;ide's picture of him, in his hymn to the Naiads, is rather a little &s;tiffly painted.
<Q><L>&mdash; With &s;lackened wings,</L>
<L>While now the &s;olemn concert breathes around,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="26">Incumbent on the &s;ceptre of his lord</L>

<L>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and &s;atiate with the melting tone;</L>
<L>Sovereign of birds. &mdash;</L></Q>
We&s;t's picture, e&s;pecially the two la&s;t lines, is a very good one.
<Q><L>The bird's fierce monarch drops his vengeful ire,</L>
<L>Perched on the &s;ceptre of th' Olympian king,</L>
<L>The thrilling power of harmony he feels</L>
<L>And indolently hangs his flagging wing;</L>
<L>While gentle &s;leep his clo&s;ing eyelid &s;eals,</L>
<L>And o'er his heaving limbs, in loo&s;e array,</L>
<L>To every balmy gale the ruffling feathers play.</L></Q></P>
<PB N="14" REF="25"></NOTE>, are all objects of this kind. Smooth-coated
<PB N="15" REF="26">
animals could not produce &s;o pictu|re&s;que an effect.</P>
<P>But when the painter thus prefers the cart-hor&s;e, the cow, or the a&s;s to other objects <HI>more beautiful in them&s;elves,</HI> he does not cer|tainly recommend his art to tho&s;e, who&s;e love of beauty makes them anxiou&s;ly &s;eek, by what means it's fleeting forms may be fixed.</P>
<P>Sugge&s;tions of this kind are ungrateful. The art of painting allows you all you wi&s;h. You de&s;ire to have a beautiful object painted&mdash; your hor&s;e, for in&s;tance, led out of the &s;table
<PB N="16" REF="27">
in all his pampered beauty. The art of paint|ing is ready to accommodate you. You have the beautiful form you admired in nature ex|actly transferred to canvas. Be then &s;atisfied. The art of painting has given you what you wanted. It is no injury to the beauty of your Arabian, if the painter think he could have given the graces of his art more forcibly to your cart-hor&s;e.</P>
<P>But does it not depreciate his art, if he give up a beautiful form, for one le&s;s beautiful, merely becau&s;e he could have given it <HI>the graces of his art more forcibly</HI>&mdash;becau&s;e it's &s;harp lines afford him a greater facility of execu|tion? Is the &s;mart touch of a pencil the grand de&s;ideratum of painting? Does he di&s;|cover nothing in <HI>picture&s;que objects,</HI> but qualities, which admit of being <HI>rendered with &s;pirit?</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould not vindicate him, if he did. At the &s;ame time, a free execution is &s;o very fa&s;cinating a part of painting, that we need not wonder, if the arti&s;t lay a great &s;tre&s;s upon it.&mdash;It is not however intirely owing, as &s;ome imagine, to the difficulty of ma&s;ter|ing an elegant line, that he prefers a rough one. In part indeed this may be the ca&s;e;
<PB N="17" REF="28">
for if an elegant line be not delicately hit off, it is the mo&s;t in&s;ipid of all lines: whereas in the de&s;cription of a rough object, an error in delineation is not ea&s;ily &s;een. However this is not the whole of the matter. A free, bold touch is in it&s;elf plea&s;ing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A &s;troke may be called <HI>free,</HI> when there is no appearance of con&s;traint. It is <HI>bold,</HI> when a part is given for the whole, which it cannot fail of &s;ugge&s;ting. This is the laconi&s;m of genius. But &s;ometimes it may be free, and yet &s;ugge&s;t only how ea&s;ily a line, which means nothing, may be executed. Such a &s;troke is not <HI>bold,</HI> but <HI>impudent.</HI></P></NOTE> In elegant figures indeed there mu&s;t be a delicate outline&mdash;at lea&s;t a line true to nature: yet the &s;urfaces even of &s;uch figures may be touched with freedom; and in the appen|dages of the compo&s;ition there mu&s;t be a mixture of rougher objects, or there will be a want of contra&s;t. In land&s;cape univer&s;ally the rougher objects are admired; which give the free&s;t &s;cope to execution. If the pencil be timid, or he&s;itating, little beauty re&s;ults. The execution then only is plea&s;ing, when the hand firm, and yet deci&s;ive, freely touches the characteri&s;tic parts of each object.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="29">If indeed, either in literary, or in pic|ture&s;que compo&s;ition you endeavour to draw the reader, or the &s;pectator from the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> to the <HI>mode of executing</HI> it, your affectation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Language, like light, is a medium; and the true phi|lo&s;ophic &s;tile, like light from a north-window, exhibits objects clearly, and di&s;tinctly, without &s;oliciting attention to it&s;elf.

At the &s;ame time, if &s;ome care, and pains be not be&s;towed on the <HI>execution,</HI> your &s;lovenline&s;s di&s;gu&s;ts, as much.

the angel on a &s;ign-po&s;t, are very different beings; but the whole of the difference con|&s;i&s;ts in an artful application of lines, &s;urfaces, and colours.</P>
<P>It is not however merely for the &s;ake of his <HI>execution,</HI> that the arti&s;t values a rough object. He finds it in many other re&s;pects accommodated to his art. In the fir&s;t place, his <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> requires it. If the hi&s;tory-painter threw all his draperies &s;mooth over his figures, his groups, and combinations would be very awkward. And in <HI>land&s;cape-painting</HI> &s;mooth objects would produce no compo&s;ition at all. In a mountain-&s;cene what compo&s;ition could ari&s;e from the corner of a &s;mooth knoll coming forward on one &s;ide, inter&s;ected by a &s;mooth knoll on the other; with a &s;mooth plain perhaps in the middle, and a &s;mooth mountain in the di&s;tance. The very idea is di&s;gu&s;ting. Picture&s;que compo|&s;ition con&s;i&s;ts in uniting in one whole a variety of parts; and the&s;e parts can only be obtained from rough objects. If the &s;mooth moun|tains, and plains were broken by different objects, the compo&s;ition might be good, on a &s;uppo&s;ition the great lines of it were &s;o before.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="33"><HI>Variety</HI> too is equally nece&s;&s;ary in his com|po&s;ition: &s;o is <HI>contra&s;t.</HI> Both the&s;e he finds in rough objects; and neither of them in &s;mooth. Variety indeed, in &s;ome degree, he may find in the outline of a &s;mooth object: but by no means enough to &s;atisfy the eye, without including the &s;urface al&s;o.</P>
<P>From <HI>rough</HI> objects al&s;o he &s;eeks the <HI>effect of light and &s;hade,</HI> which they are as well di&s;po&s;ed to produce, as they are the beauty of compo&s;ition. One uniform light, or one uniform &s;hade produces no effect. It is the various &s;urfaces of objects, &s;ometimes turn|ing to the light in one way, and &s;ometimes in another, that give the painter his choice of opportunities in ma&s;&s;ing, and graduating both his lights, and &s;hades.&mdash;The <HI>richne&s;s</HI> al&s;o of the light depends on the breaks, and little rece&s;&s;es, which it finds on the &s;urfaces of bodies. What the painter calls <HI>richne&s;s</HI> on a &s;urface, is only a variety of little parts; on which the light &s;hining, &s;hews all it's &s;mall inequalities, and roughne&s;&s;es; and in the painter's language, <HI>inriches</HI> it.&mdash;The beauty al&s;o of <HI>catching lights</HI> ari&s;es from the roughne&s;s of objects. What the painter calls a <HI>catching light</HI> is a &s;trong touch of light
<PB N="21" REF="34">
on &s;ome prominent part of a &s;urface, while the re&s;t is in &s;hadow. A &s;mooth &s;urface has no &s;uch prominences.</P>
<P>In <HI>colouring</HI> al&s;o, <HI>rough</HI> objects give the painter another advantage. Smooth bodies are commonly as uniform in their colour, as they are in their &s;urface. In glo&s;&s;y objects, tho &s;mooth, the colouring may &s;ometimes vary. In general however it is otherwi&s;e; in the objects of land&s;cape, particularly. The &s;mooth &s;ide of a hill is generally of one uniform colour; while the fractured rock pre&s;ents it's grey &s;urface, adorned with patches of green&s;ward running down it's guttered &s;ides; and the broken ground is every where varied with an okery tint, a grey gravel, or a leaden-coloured clay: &s;o that in fact the rich colours of the ground ari&s;e generally from it's broken &s;urface.</P>
<P>From &s;uch rea&s;oning then we infer, that it is not merely for the &s;ake of his <HI>execution,</HI> that the painter prefers <HI>rough</HI> objects to <HI>&s;mooth.</HI> The very e&s;&s;ence of his art requires it.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="35">As picture&s;que beauty therefore &s;o greatly depends on <HI>rough</HI> objects, are we to exclude every idea of <HI>&s;moothne&s;s</HI> from mixing with it? Are we &s;truck with no plea&s;ing image, when the lake is &s;pread upon the canvas; the <HI>mar|moreum aequor,</HI> pure, limpid, &s;mooth, as the poli&s;hed mirror?</P>
<P>We acknowledge it to be picture&s;que: but we mu&s;t at the &s;ame time recollect, that, in fact, the &s;moothne&s;s of the lake is more in <HI>reality,</HI> than in <HI>appearance.</HI> Were it &s;pread upon the canvas in one &s;imple hue, it would certainly be a dull, fatiguing object. But to the eye it appears broken by &s;hades of various kinds; by the undulations of the water; or by reflections from all the rough objects in it's neighbourhood.</P>
<P>It is thus too in other glo&s;&s;y bodies. Tho the hor&s;e, in a <HI>rough</HI> &s;tate, as we have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, or worn down with labour, is more adapted to the pencil, than when his &s;ides &s;hine with bru&s;hing, and high-feeding; yet in this latter &s;tate al&s;o he is certainly a pictu|re&s;que object. But it is not his &s;mooth, and &s;hining coat, that makes him &s;o. It is the apparent interruption of that &s;moothne&s;s by a variety of &s;hades, and colours, which produces
<PB N="23" REF="36">
the effect. Such a play of mu&s;cles appears, every where, through the finene&s;s of his &s;kin, gently &s;welling, and &s;inking into each other&mdash; he is all over &s;o <HI>lubricus a&s;pici,</HI> the reflections of light are &s;o continually &s;hifting upon him, and playing into each other, that the eye never con&s;iders the &s;moothne&s;s of the &s;urface; but is amu&s;ed with gliding up, and down, among the&s;e endle&s;s tran&s;itions, which in &s;ome degree, &s;upply the room of <HI>roughne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>It is thus too in the plumage of birds. Nothing can be &s;ofter, nothing &s;moother to the touch; and yet it is certainly picture&s;que. But it is not the &s;moothne&s;s of the &s;urface, which produces the effect&mdash;it is not this we admire: it is the breaking of the colours: it is the bright green, or purple, changing perhaps into a rich azure, or velvet black; from thence taking a &s;emitint; and &s;o on through all the varieties of colour. Or if the colour be not changeable, it is the harmony we admire in the&s;e elegant little touches of na|ture's pencil. The &s;moothne&s;s of the &s;urface is only the ground of the colours. In it&s;elf we admire it no more, than we do the &s;mooth|ne&s;s of the canvas, which receives the colours of the picture. Even the plumage of the &s;wan,
<PB N="24" REF="37">
which to the inaccurate ob&s;erver appears only of one &s;imple hue, is in fact varied with a thou&s;and &s;oft &s;hadows, and brilliant touches, at once di&s;coverable to the picture&s;que eye.</P>
<P>Thus too a piece of poli&s;hed marble may be picture&s;que; but it is only, when the poli&s;h brings out beautiful veins, which in <HI>appearance</HI> break the &s;urface by a variety of lines, and colours. Let the marble be perfectly white, and the effect vani&s;hes. Thus al&s;o a mirror may have picture&s;que beauty; but it is only from it's reflections. In an unreflecting &s;tate, it is in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>In &s;tatuary we &s;ometimes &s;ee an inferior arti&s;t give his marble a glo&s;s, thinking to atone for his bad workman&s;hip by his excellent poli&s;h. The effect &s;hews in how &s;mall a degree &s;moothne&s;s enters into the idea of the picture&s;que. When the light plays on the &s;hining coat of a pampered hor&s;e, it plays among the lines, and mu&s;cles of nature; and is therefore founded in truth. But the poli&s;h of marble-fle&s;h is unnatural<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>On all human fle&s;h held between the eye and the light, there is a degree of poli&s;h. I &s;peak not here of &s;uch a poli&s;h
<PB N="25" REF="38">as this, which wrought marble always, in a degree, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, as well as human fle&s;h; but of the highe&s;t poli&s;h, which can be given to marble; and which has always a very bad effect. If I wanted an example, the bu&s;t of arch-bi&s;hop Boulter in We&s;t|min&s;ter-abbey would afford a very glaring one.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="37"></NOTE>. The lights
<PB N="25" REF="38">
therefore are fal&s;e; and &s;moothne&s;s being here one of the chief qualities to admire, we are di&s;gu&s;ted; and &s;ay, it makes bad, wor&s;e.</P>
<P>After all, we mean not to a&s;&s;ert, that even a &s;imple &s;mooth &s;urface is in no &s;ituation pic|ture&s;que. In <HI>contra&s;t</HI> it certainly may be: nay in contra&s;t it is often nece&s;&s;ary. The beauty of an old head is greatly improved by the &s;moothne&s;s of the bald pate; and the rougher parts of the rock mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;et off with the &s;moother. But the point lies here: to make an object in a peculiar man|ner picture&s;que, there <HI>mu&s;t be</HI> a proportion of <HI>roughne&s;s;</HI> &s;o much at lea&s;t, as to make an oppo&s;ition; which in an object &s;imply beau|tiful, is unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Some quibbling opponent may throw out, that wherever there is &s;moothne&s;s, there mu&s;t al&s;o be roughne&s;s. The &s;moothe&s;t plain con|&s;i&s;ts of many rougher parts; and the roughe&s;t rock of many &s;moother; and there is &s;uch a variety of degrees in both, that it is hard to
<PB N="26" REF="39">
&s;ay, where you have the preci&s;e ideas of <HI>rough,</HI> and <HI>&s;mooth.</HI></P>
<P>To this it is enough, that the province of the picture&s;que eye is to <HI>&s;urvey nature;</HI> not to <HI>anatomize matter.</HI> It throws it's glances around in the broad-ca&s;t &s;tile. It comprehends an exten&s;ive tract at each &s;weep. It examines <HI>parts,</HI> but never de&s;cends to <HI>particles.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus from a variety of examples en|deavoured to &s;hew, that <HI>roughne&s;s</HI> either <HI>real,</HI> or <HI>apparent,</HI> forms an e&s;&s;ential difference be|tween the <HI>beautiful,</HI> and the <HI>picture&s;que;</HI> it may be expected, that we &s;hould point out the rea&s;on of this difference. It is obvious enough, why the painter prefers <HI>rough</HI> objects to <HI>&s;mooth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 19, &amp;c.</NOTE>: but it is not &s;o obvious, why the quality of <HI>roughne&s;s</HI> &s;hould make an <HI>e&s;&s;ential difference</HI> between the objects of <HI>nature,</HI> and the objects of <HI>artificial repre&s;entation.</HI></P>
<P>To this que&s;tion, we might an&s;wer, that the picture&s;que eye abhors art; and delights &s;olely in nature: and that as art abounds with <HI>regularity,</HI> which is only another name
<PB N="27" REF="40">
for <HI>&s;moothne&s;s;</HI> and the images of nature with <HI>irregularity,</HI> which is only another name for <HI>roughne&s;s,</HI> we have here a &s;olution of our que&s;tion.</P>
<P>But is this &s;olution &s;atisfactory? I fear not. Tho art often abounds with regularity, it does not follow, that all art mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily do &s;o. The picture&s;que eye, it is true, finds it's <HI>chief</HI> objects in nature; but it delights al&s;o in the images of art, if they are marked with the characteri&s;tics, which it requires. <HI>A painter's nature</HI> is whatever he <HI>imitates;</HI> whether the object be what is commonly called natural, or artificial. Is there a greater ornament of land&s;cape, than the ruins of a ca&s;tle? What painter rejects it, becau&s;e it is artificial?&mdash;What beautiful effects does Vandervelt produce from &s;hipping? In the hands of &s;uch a ma&s;ter it furni&s;hes almo&s;t as beautiful forms, as any in the whole circle of picture&s;que objects?&mdash;And what could the hi&s;tory-painter do, without his draperies to combine, contra&s;t, and harmonize his figures?

greatly to embelli&s;h his pictures with plea&s;ing &s;hapes.</P>
<P>Shall we then &s;eek the &s;olution of our que&s;tion in the great foundation of picture&s;que beauty? in the <HI>happy union of &s;implicity and variety;</HI> to which the <HI>rough</HI> ideas e&s;&s;entially contribute. An extended plain is a &s;imple object. It is the continuation only of one uniform idea. But the mere <HI>&s;implicity</HI> of a plain produces no beauty. Break the &s;ur|face of it, as you did your plea&s;ure-ground; add trees, rocks, and declivities; that is, give it <HI>roughne&s;s,</HI> and you give it al&s;o <HI>variety.</HI> Thus by inriching the <HI>parts</HI> of a united <HI>whole</HI> with <HI>roughne&s;s,</HI> you obtain the combined idea of <HI>&s;implicity,</HI> and <HI>variety;</HI> from whence re&s;ults the picture&s;que.&mdash;Is this a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to our que&s;tion?</P>
<P>By no means. <HI>Simplicity and variety</HI> are &s;ources of the <HI>beautiful,</HI> as well as of the <HI>picture&s;que.</HI> Why does the architect break the front of his pile with ornaments? Is it not to add variety to &s;mplicity? Even the very black-&s;mith acknowledges this prin|ciple by forming ringlets, and bulbous circles on his tongs, and pokers. In nature it is the &s;ame; and your plain will ju&s;t as much
<PB N="29" REF="42">
be improved <HI>in reality</HI> by breaking it, as <HI>upon canvas.</HI>&mdash;In a garden-&s;cene the idea is dif|ferent. There every object is of the neat, and elegant kind. What is otherwi&s;e, is in|harmonious, and <HI>roughne&s;s</HI> would be di&s;order.</P>
<P>Shall we then change our ground; and &s;eek an an&s;wer to our que&s;tion in the nature of the art of painting? As it is an art <HI>&s;trictly imi|tative,</HI> tho&s;e objects will of cour&s;e appear mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly to the picture&s;que eye, which are the mo&s;t ea&s;ily imitated. The &s;tronger the features are, the &s;tronger will be the effect of imitation; and as rough objects have the &s;tronge&s;t features, they will con&s;e|quently, when repre&s;ented, appear to mo&s;t advantage.&mdash;Is this an&s;wer more &s;atisfactory?</P>
<P>Very little, in truth. Every painter, knows that a &s;mooth object may be as ea&s;ily, and as well imitated, as a rough one.</P>
<P>Shall we then take an oppo&s;ite ground, and &s;ay ju&s;t the rever&s;e (as men pre&s;&s;ed with dif|ficulties will &s;ay any thing) that painting is <HI>not</HI> an art <HI>&s;trictly imitative,</HI> but rather <HI>deceptive</HI> &mdash;that by an a&s;&s;emblage of colours, and a peculiar art in &s;preading them, the painter gives a &s;emblance of nature at a proper di&s;|tance; which at hand, is quite another thing
<PB N="30" REF="43">
&mdash;that tho&s;e objects, which we call picture&s;que, are only &s;uch as are more adapted to this art &mdash;and that as this art is mo&s;t concealed in rough touches, rough objects are of cour&s;e the mo&s;t picture&s;que.&mdash;Have we now at|tained a &s;atisfactory account of the matter?</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as much &s;o, as before. Many painters of note did not u&s;e the rough &s;tile of painting; and yet their pictures are as admirable, as the pictures of tho&s;e, who did: nor are rough objects le&s;s picture&s;que on their canvas, than on the canvas of others: that is, they paint rough objects &s;moothly.</P>
<P>Thus foiled, &s;hall we in the true &s;pirit of inquiry, per&s;i&s;t; or hone&s;tly give up the cau&s;e, and own we cannot &s;earch out the &s;ource of this difference? I am afraid this is the truth, whatever airs of dogmatizing we may a&s;&s;ume. Inquiries into <HI>principles</HI> rarely end in &s;atisfac|tion. Could we even gain &s;atisfaction in our pre&s;ent que&s;tion, new doubts would ari&s;e. The very fir&s;t principles of our art would be que&s;|tioned. Difficulties would &s;tart up <HI>ve&s;tibulum ante ip&s;um.</HI> We &s;hould be a&s;ked, What is beauty? What is ta&s;te?&mdash;Let us &s;tep a&s;ide a moment, and li&s;ten to the debates of the learned on the&s;e heads. They will at lea&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="44">
&s;hew us, that however we may wi&s;h to &s;ix <HI>principles,</HI> our inquiries are &s;eldom &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>One philo&s;opher will tell us, that ta&s;te is only the improvement of our own ideas. Every man has naturally his proportion of ta&s;te. The &s;eeds of it are innate. All depends on culti|vation.</P>
<P>Another philo&s;opher following the analogy of nature, ob&s;erves, that as all mens faces are different, we may well &s;uppo&s;e their minds to be &s;o likewi&s;e. He rejects the idea there|fore of innate ta&s;te; and in the room of this makes <HI>utility</HI> the &s;tandard both of ta&s;te, and beauty.</P>
<P>Another philo&s;opher thinks the idea of <HI>utility</HI> as ab&s;urd, as the la&s;t did that of <HI>innate ta&s;te.</HI> What, cries he, can I not admire the beauty of a re&s;plendent &s;un-&s;et, till I have inve&s;tigated the <HI>utility</HI> of that peculiar radiance in the at|mo&s;phere? He then wi&s;hes we had a little le&s;s philo&s;ophy among&s;t us, and a little more common &s;en&s;e. <HI>Common &s;en&s;e</HI> is de&s;pi&s;ed like other common things: but, in his opinion, if we made <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> the criterion in matters of art, as well as &s;cience, we &s;hould be nearer the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="45">A fourth philo&s;opher apprehends <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> to be our &s;tandard only in the ordinary affairs of life. The bounty of nature has furni&s;hed us with various other &s;en&s;es &s;uited to the objects, among which we conver&s;e: and with regard to matters of ta&s;te, it has &s;upplied us with what, he doubts not, we all feel within our|&s;elves, <HI>a &s;en&s;e of beauty.</HI></P>
<P>Pooh! &s;ays another learned inquirer, what is a <HI>&s;en&s;e of beauty? Sen&s;e</HI> is a vague idea, and &s;o is <HI>beauty;</HI> and it is impo&s;&s;ible that any thing determined can re&s;ult from terms &s;o inaccurate. But if we lay a&s;ide a <HI>&s;en&s;e of beauty,</HI> and adopt <HI>proportion,</HI> we &s;hall all be right. <HI>Proportion</HI> is the great principle of ta&s;te, and beauty. We admit it both in lines, and colours; and indeed refer all our ideas of the elegant kind to it's &s;tandard.</P>
<P>True, &s;ays an admirer of the antique; but this proportion mu&s;t have a rule, or we gain nothing: and a <HI>rule of proportion</HI> there cer|tainly is: but we may inquire after it in vain. The &s;ecret is lo&s;t. The ancients had it. They well knew the principles of beauty; and had that unerring rule, which in all things adju&s;ted their ta&s;te. We &s;ee it even in their &s;lighte&s;t va&s;es. In <HI>their</HI> works, proportion, tho varied
<PB N="33" REF="46">
through a thou&s;and lines, is &s;till the &s;ame; and if we could only di&s;cover their <HI>principles of proportion,</HI> we &s;hould have the arcanum of this &s;cience; and might &s;ettle all our di&s;putes about ta&s;te with great ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus, in our inquiries into <HI>fir&s;t principles,</HI> we go on, without end, and without &s;atis|faction. The human under&s;tanding is unequal to the &s;earch. In philo&s;ophy we inquire for them in vain&mdash;in phy&s;ics&mdash;in metaphy&s;ics&mdash;in morals. Even in the polite arts, where the &s;ubject, one &s;hould imagine, is le&s;s recondite, the inquiry, we find, is equally vague. We are puzzled, and bewildered; but not informed. All is uncertainty; a &s;trife of words; the old conte&s;t, <Q>Empedocles, an Stertinii deliret acumen?</Q></P>
<P>In a word, if <HI>a cau&s;e be &s;ufficiently under&s;tood,</HI> it may &s;ugge&s;t u&s;eful di&s;coveries. But if it be <HI>not &s;o</HI> (and where is our certainty in the&s;e di&s;qui&s;itions) it will unque&s;tionably <HI>mi&s;lead.</HI></P>

<P>Tho I read now but little, yet I have read with great attention the e&s;&s;ay, which you was &s;o good to put into my hands, on the difference between the <HI>beautiful,</HI> and the <HI>picture&s;que;</HI> and I may truly &s;ay, I have re|ceived from it much plea&s;ure, and improve|ment.</P>
<P>Without oppo&s;ing any of your &s;entiments, it has &s;ugge&s;ted an idea, that may be worth con&s;ideration&mdash;whether the epithet <HI>picture&s;que</HI> is not applicable to the excellences of the inferior &s;chools, rather than to the higher.
<PB N="35" REF="48">
The works of Michael Angelo, Raphael, &amp;c. appear to me to have nothing of it; whereas Reubens, and the Venetian painters may almo&s;t be &s;aid to have nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Perhaps <HI>picture&s;que</HI> is &s;omewhat &s;ynonymous to the word <HI>ta&s;te;</HI> which we &s;hould think im|properly applied to Homer, or Milton, but very well to Pope, or Prior. I &s;u&s;pect that the application of the&s;e words are to excellences of an inferior order; and which are incompatible with the grand &s;tile.</P>
<P>You are certainly right in &s;aying, that va|riety of tints and forms is picture&s;que; but it mu&s;t be remembred, on the other hand, that the rever&s;e of this&mdash;(uniformity of colour, and a long continuation of lines,) produces gran|deur.</P>
<P>I had an intention of pointing out the pa&s;&s;ages, that particularly &s;truck me; but I was afraid to u&s;e my eyes &s;o much.</P>
<P>The e&s;&s;ay has lain upon my table; and I think no day has pa&s;&s;ed without my looking at it, reading a little at a time.

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am much obliged to you for looking over my e&s;&s;ay at a time, when the complaint in your eyes mu&s;t have made an intru&s;ion of this kind trouble&s;ome. But as the &s;ubject was rather novel, I wi&s;hed much for your &s;anction; and you have given it me in as flattering a manner, as I could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>With regard to the term <HI>picture&s;que,</HI> I have always my&s;elf u&s;ed it merely to denote <HI>&s;uch objects, as are proper &s;ubjects for painting:</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="52">
&s;o that, according to <HI>my definition,</HI> one of the cartoons, and a flower-piece are equally pic|turesque.</P>
<P>I think however I under&s;tand your idea of extending the term to what may be called <HI>ta&s;te in painting</HI>&mdash;or the art of fa&s;cinating the eye by &s;plendid colouring, and artificial com|binations; which the inferior &s;chools valued; and the dignity of the higher perhaps de&s;pi&s;ed. But I have &s;een &s;o little of the higher &s;chools, that I &s;hould be very ill able to carry the &s;ub|ject farther by illu&s;trating a di&s;qui&s;ition of this kind. Except the cartoons, I never &s;aw a picture of Raphael's, that an&s;wered my idea; and of the original works of Michael Angelo I have little conception.</P>
<P>But tho I am unable, through ignorance, to appreciate fully the grandeur of the Roman &s;chool, I have at lea&s;t the plea&s;ure to find I have always held as a principle your idea of the production of greatne&s;s by <HI>uniformity of colour, and a long continuation of line:</HI> and when I &s;peak of <HI>variety,</HI> I certainly do not mean to confound it's effects with tho&s;e of <HI>grandeur.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY II. ON PICTURESQUE TRAVEL.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB N="41" REF="54">ESSAY II.</HEAD>
<P>ENOUGH has been &s;aid to &s;hew the difficulty of <HI>a&s;&s;igning cau&s;es:</HI> let us then take another cour&s;e, and amu&s;e our&s;elves with <HI>&s;earching after effects.</HI> This is the general intention of picture&s;que travel. We mean not to bring it into competition with any of the more u&s;eful ends of travelling: but as many travel without any end at all, amu&s;ing them|&s;elves without being able to give a rea&s;on why they are amu&s;ed, we offer an end, which may po&s;&s;ibly engage &s;ome vacant minds; and may indeed afford a rational amu&s;ement to &s;uch as travel for more important purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>In treating of picture&s;que travel, we may con&s;ider fir&s;t it's <HI>object;</HI> and &s;econdly it's &s;ources of <HI>amu&s;ement.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="55">It's <HI>object</HI> is beauty of every kind, which either art, or nature can produce: but it is chiefly that &s;pecies of <HI>picture&s;que beauty,</HI> which we have endeavoured to characterize in the preceding e&s;&s;ay. This great object we pur&s;ue through the &s;cenery of nature; and examine it by the rules of painting. We &s;eek it among all the ingredients of land&s;cape&mdash;trees&mdash;rocks &mdash;broken-grounds&mdash;woods&mdash;rivers&mdash;lakes&mdash; plains&mdash;vallies&mdash;mountains&mdash;and di&s;tances. The&s;e objects <HI>in them&s;elves</HI> produce infinite variety. No two rocks, or trees are exactly the &s;ame. They are varied, a &s;econd time, by <HI>combination;</HI> and almo&s;t as much, a third time, by different <HI>lights, and &s;hades,</HI> and other aerial effects. Sometimes we find among them the exhibition of <HI>a whole;</HI> but oftener we find only beautiful <HI>parts.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As &s;ome of the&s;e topics have been occa&s;ionally men|tioned in other picture&s;que works, which the author has given the public, they are here touched very &s;lightly: only the &s;ub|ject required they &s;hould be brought together.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>That we may examine picture&s;que objects with more ea&s;e, it may be u&s;eful to cla&s;s them into the <HI>&s;ublime,</HI> and the <HI>beautiful;</HI> tho, in fact, this di&s;tinction is rather inaccurate.
<PB N="43" REF="56">
<HI>Sublimity alone</HI> cannot make an object <HI>pic|ture&s;que.</HI> However grand the mountain, or the rock may be, it has no claim to this epithet, unle&s;s it's form, it's colour, or it's accompaniments have <HI>&s;ome degree of beauty.</HI> Nothing can be more &s;ublime, than the ocean: but wholly unaccompanied, it has little of the picture&s;que. When we talk therefore of a &s;ublime object, we always under&s;tand, that it is al&s;o beautiful: and we call it &s;ublime, or beautiful, only as the ideas of &s;ublimity, or of &s;imple beauty prevail.</P>
<P>The <HI>curious,</HI> and <HI>fanta&s;tic</HI> forms of nature are by no means the favourite objects of the lovers of land&s;cape. There may be beauty in a <HI>curious</HI> object; and &s;o far it may be picture&s;que: but we cannot admire it merely for the &s;ake of it's curio&s;ity. The <HI>lu&s;us naturae</HI> is the naturali&s;t's province, not the painter's. The &s;piry pinnacles of the mountain, and the ca&s;tle-like arrangement of the rock, give no peculiar plea&s;ure to the picture&s;que eye. It is fond of the &s;implicity of nature; and &s;ees mo&s;t beauty in her <HI>mo&s;t u&s;ual</HI> forms. The <HI>Giant's cau&s;eway</HI> in Ireland may &s;trike it as a novelty; but the lake of Killarney attracts it's attention. It would range with &s;upreme
<PB N="44" REF="57">
delight among the &s;weet vales of Switzerland; but would view only with a tran&s;ient glance, the Glaciers of Savoy. Scenes of this kind, as unu&s;ual, may plea&s;e <HI>once;</HI> but the great works of nature, in her &s;imple&s;t and pure&s;t &s;tile, open inexhau&s;ted &s;prings of amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>But it is not only the <HI>form,</HI> and the <HI>com|po&s;ition</HI> of the objects of land&s;cape, which the picture&s;que eye examines; it connects them with the atmo&s;phere, and &s;eeks for all tho&s;e various effects, which are produced from that va&s;t, and wonderful &s;torehou&s;e of nature. Nor is there in travelling a greater plea&s;ure, than when a &s;cene of grandeur bur&s;ts unexpectedly upon the eye, accompanied with &s;ome acci|dental circum&s;tance of the atmo&s;phere, which harmonizes with it, and gives it double value.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the <HI>inanimate</HI> face of nature, it's <HI>living forms</HI> fall under the picture&s;que eye, in the cour&s;e of travel; and are often objects of great attention. The anatomical &s;tudy of figures is not attended to: we regard them merely as the ornament of &s;cenes. In the human figure we contemplate neither <HI>exactne&s;s of form;</HI> nor <HI>expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> any farther than it is &s;hewn in <HI>action:</HI> we merely con&s;ider general &s;hapes, dre&s;&s;es, groups, and occupations; which
<PB N="45" REF="58">
we often find <HI>ca&s;ually</HI> in greater variety, and beauty, than any &s;election can procure.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner animals are the objects of our attention, whether we find them in the park, the fore&s;t, or the field. Here too we con&s;ider little more, than their general forms, actions, and combinations. Nor is the pic|ture&s;que eye &s;o fa&s;tidious as to de&s;pi&s;e even le&s;s con&s;iderable objects. A flight of birds has often a plea&s;ing effect. In &s;hort, every form of life, and being has it's u&s;e as a picture&s;que object, till it become too &s;mall for attention.</P>
<P>But the picture&s;que eye is not merely re&s;|tricted to nature. It ranges through the limits of art. The picture, the &s;tatue, and the gar|den are all the objects of it's attention. In the embelli&s;hed plea&s;ure-ground particularly, tho all is neat, and elegant&mdash;far too neat and elegant for the u&s;e of the pencil; yet, if it be well laid out, it exhibits the <HI>lines,</HI> and <HI>principles</HI> of land&s;cape; and is well worth the &s;tudy of the picture&s;que traveller. Nothing is wanting, but what his imagination can &s;upply&mdash;a change from &s;mooth to rough.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 8.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="59">But among all the objects of art, the pictu|re&s;que eye is perhaps mo&s;t inqui&s;itive after the elegant relics of ancient architecture; the ruined tower, the Gothic arch, the remains of ca&s;tles, and abbeys. The&s;e are the riche&s;t legacies of art. They are con&s;ecrated by time; and al|mo&s;t de&s;erve the veneration we pay to the works of nature it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus univer&s;al are the objects of picture&s;que travel. We pur&s;ue <HI>beauty</HI> in every &s;hape; through nature, through art; and all it's various arrangements in form, and colour; admiring it in the grande&s;t objects, and not rejecting it in the humble&s;t.</P>
<P>From the <HI>objects</HI> of picture&s;que travel, we con&s;ider it's <HI>&s;ources of amu&s;ement</HI>&mdash;or in what way the mind is gratified by the&s;e objects.</P>
<P>We might begin in moral &s;tile; and con&s;ider the objects of nature in a higher light, than merely as amu&s;ement. We might ob&s;erve, that a &s;earch after beauty &s;hould naturally lead the mind to the great origin of all beauty; to the <Q>&mdash; fir&s;t good, fir&s;t perfect, and fir&s;t fair.</Q>
<PB N="47" REF="60">
But tho in theory this &s;eems a natural climax, we in&s;i&s;t the le&s;s upon it, as in fact we have &s;carce ground to hope, that every admirer of <HI>picture&s;que beauty,</HI> is an admirer al&s;o of the <HI>beauty of virtue;</HI> and that every lover of nature reflects, that
<Q><L>Nature is but a name for an <HI>effect,</HI></L>
<L>Who&s;e <HI>cau&s;e</HI> is God. &mdash;</L></Q>
If however the admirer of nature can turn his amu&s;ements to a higher purpo&s;e; if it's great &s;cenes can in&s;pire him with religious awe; or it's tranquil &s;cenes with that compla|cency of mind, which is &s;o nearly allied to benevolence, it is certainly the better. <HI>Appo|nat lucro.</HI> It is &s;o much into the bargain: for we dare not <HI>promi&s;e</HI> him more from pictu|re&s;que travel, than a rational, and agreeable amu&s;ement. Yet even this may be of &s;ome u&s;e in an age teeming with licentious plea&s;ure; and may in this light at lea&s;t be con&s;idered as having a moral tendency.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ource of amu&s;ement to the pictu|re&s;que traveller, is the <HI>pur&s;uit</HI> of his object&mdash; the expectation of new &s;cenes continually open|ing, and ari&s;ing to his view. We &s;uppo&s;e the country to have been unexplored. Under this circum&s;tance the mind is kept con&s;tantly in an
<PB N="48" REF="61">
agreeable &s;u&s;pence. The love of novelty is the foundation of this plea&s;ure. Every di&s;tant ho|rizon promi&s;es &s;omething new; and with this plea&s;ing expectation we follow nature through all her walks. We pur&s;ue her from hill to dale; and hunt after tho&s;e various beauties, with which &s;he every where abounds.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ures of the cha&s;e are univer&s;al. A hare &s;tarted before dogs is enough to &s;et a whole country in an uproar. The plough, and the &s;pade are de&s;erted. Care is left be|hind; and every human faculty is dilated with joy.</P>
<P>And &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e it a greater plea&s;ure to the &s;port&s;man to pur&s;ue a trivial animal, than it is to the man of ta&s;te to pur&s;ue the beauties of nature? to follow her through all her rece&s;&s;es? to obtain a &s;udden glance, as &s;he flits pa&s;t him in &s;ome airy &s;hape? to trace her through the mazes of the cover? to wind after her along the vale? or along the reaches of the river?</P>
<P>After the pur&s;uit we are gratified with the <HI>attainment</HI> of the object. Our amu&s;ement, on this head, ari&s;es from the employment of the mind in examining the beautiful &s;cenes we have found. Sometimes we examine them under the idea of a <HI>whole:</HI> we admire the com|po&s;ition,
<PB N="49" REF="62">
the colouring, and the light, in one <HI>comprehen&s;ive view.</HI> When we are fortunate enough to fall in with &s;cenes of this kind, we are highly delighted. But as we have le&s;s frequent opportunities of being thus gratified, we are more commonly employed in analyzing the <HI>parts of &s;cenes;</HI> which may be exqui&s;itely beautiful, tho unable to produce a whole. We examine what would amend the compo&s;ition; how little is wanting to reduce it to the rules of our art; what a trifling circum&s;tance &s;ometimes forms the limit between beauty, and deformity. Or we com|pare the objects before us with other objects of the &s;ame kind:&mdash;or perhaps we compare them with the imitations of art. From all the&s;e operations of the mind re&s;ults great amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>But it is not from this <HI>&s;cientifical</HI> employ|ment, that we derive our chief plea&s;ure. We are mo&s;t delighted, when &s;ome grand &s;cene, tho perhaps of incorrect compo&s;ition, ri&s;ing before the eye, &s;trikes us beyond the power of thought&mdash;when the <HI>vox faucibus haeret;</HI> and every mental operation is &s;u&s;pended. In this pau&s;e of intellect; this <HI>deliquium</HI> of the &s;oul, an enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure over&s;preads
<PB N="50" REF="63">
it, previous to any examination by the rules of art. The general idea of the &s;cene makes an impre&s;&s;ion, before any appeal is made to the judgment. We rather <HI>feel,</HI> than <HI>&s;urvey</HI> it.</P>
<P>This high delight is generally indeed pro|duced by the &s;cenes of nature; yet &s;ometimes by artificial objects. Here and there a capital picture will rai&s;e the&s;e emotions: but oftener the rough &s;ketch of a capital ma&s;ter. This has &s;ometimes an a&s;toni&s;hing effect on the mind; giving the imagination an opening into all tho&s;e glowing ideas, which in&s;pired the arti&s;t; and which the imagination <HI>only</HI> can tran&s;late. In general however the works of art affect us coolly; and allow the eye to cri|ticize at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>Having gained by a minute examination of incidents a compleat idea of an object, our next amu&s;ement ari&s;es from inlarging, and correcting our general &s;tock of ideas. The variety of nature is &s;uch, that <HI>new objects,</HI> and new combinations of them, are continually adding &s;omething to our fund, and inlarging our collection: while the <HI>&s;ame kind of object</HI> occurring frequently, is &s;een under various &s;hapes; and makes us, if I may &s;o &s;peak, more learned in nature. We get it more by heart.
<PB N="51" REF="64">
He who has &s;een only one oak-tree, has no compleat idea of an oak in general: but he who has examined thou&s;ands of oak-trees, mu&s;t have &s;een that beautiful plant in all it's va|rieties; and obtains a full, and compleat idea of it.</P>
<P>From this correct knowledge of objects ari&s;es another amu&s;ement; that of repre&s;enting, by a few &s;trokes in a &s;ketch, tho&s;e ideas, which have made the mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ion upon us. A few &s;cratches, like a &s;hort-hand &s;crawl of our own, legible at lea&s;t to our&s;elves, will &s;erve to rai&s;e in our minds the remembrance of the beauties they humbly repre&s;ent; and recal to our memory even the &s;plendid colouring, and force of light, which exi&s;ted in the real &s;cene. Some naturali&s;ts &s;uppo&s;e, the act of rumina|ting, in animals, to be attended with more plea&s;ure, than the act of gro&s;&s;er ma&s;tication. It may be &s;o in travelling al&s;o. There may be more plea&s;ure in recollecting, and record|ing, from a few tran&s;ient lines, the &s;cenes we have admired, than in the pre&s;ent enjoyment of them. If the &s;cenes indeed have <HI>peculiar greatne&s;s,</HI> this &s;econdary plea&s;ure cannot be at|tended with tho&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;tic feelings, which accompanied the real exhibition. But, in
<PB N="52" REF="65">
general, tho it may be a calmer &s;pecies of plea|&s;ure, it is more uniform, and uninterrupted. It flatters us too with the idea of a &s;ort of creation of our own; and it is unallayed with that fatigue, which is often a con&s;iderable abatement to the plea&s;ures of traver&s;ing the wild, and &s;avage parts of nature.&mdash;After we have amu&s;ed <HI>our&s;elves</HI> with our &s;ketches, if we can, in any degree, contribute to the amu&s;ement of others al&s;o, the plea&s;ure is &s;urely &s;o much inhanced.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another amu&s;ement ari&s;ing from the correct knowledge of objects; and that is the power of creating, and repre&s;enting <HI>&s;cenes of fancy;</HI> which is &s;till more a work of creation, than copying from nature. The imagination becomes a camera ob&s;cura, only with this difference, that the camera repre&s;ents objects as they really are; while the imagi|nation, impre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenes, and cha&s;tened by rules of art, forms it's pictures, not only from the mo&s;t admirable parts of nature; but in the be&s;t ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Some arti&s;ts, when they give their imagi|nation play, let it loo&s;e among uncommon &s;cenes&mdash;&s;uch as perhaps never exi&s;ted: whereas the nearer they approach the &s;imple &s;tandard
<PB N="53" REF="66">
of nature, in it's mo&s;t beautiful forms, the more admirable their fictions will appear. It is thus in writing romances. The correct ta&s;te cannot bear tho&s;e unnatural &s;ituations, in which heroes, and heroines are often placed: whereas a &s;tory, <HI>naturally,</HI> and of cour&s;e <HI>af|fectingly</HI> told, either with a pen, or a pencil, tho known to be a fiction, is con&s;idered as a tran&s;cript from nature; and takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart. The <HI>marvellous</HI> di&s;gu&s;ts the &s;ober imagination; which is gratified only with the pure characters of nature.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Beauty be&s;t is taught</L>
<L>By tho&s;e, the favoured few, whom heaven has lent</L>
<L>The power to &s;eize, &s;elect, and reunite</L>
<L>Her lovelie&s;t features; and of the&s;e to form</L>
<L>One archetype compleat, of &s;overeign grace.</L>
<L>Here nature &s;ees her faire&s;t forms more fair;</L>
<L>Owns them as hers, yet owns her&s;elf excelled</L>
<L>By what her&s;elf produced.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>But if we are unable to embody our ideas even in a humble &s;ketch, yet &s;till a &s;trong <HI>impre&s;&s;ion of nature</HI> will enable us to judge of the <HI>works of art.</HI> Nature is the archetype. The &s;tronger therefore the impre&s;&s;ion, the better the judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="67">We are, in &s;ome degree, al&s;o amu&s;ed by the very vi&s;ions of fancy it&s;elf. Often, when &s;lumber has half-clo&s;ed the eye, and &s;hut out all the objects of &s;en&s;e, e&s;pecially after the enjoyment of &s;ome &s;plendid &s;cene; the ima|gination, active, and alert, collects it's &s;cat|tered ideas, tran&s;po&s;es, combines, and &s;hifts them into a thou&s;and forms, producing &s;uch exqui&s;ite &s;cenes, &s;uch &s;ublime arrangements, &s;uch glow, and harmony of colouring, &s;uch brilliant lights, &s;uch depth, and clearne&s;s of &s;hadow, as equally foil de&s;cription, and every attempt of artificial colouring.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be objected to the plea&s;ure|able circum&s;tances, which are thus &s;aid to attend picture&s;que travel, that we meet as many di&s;gu&s;ting, as plea&s;ing objects; and the man of ta&s;te therefore will be as often offended, as amu&s;ed.</P>
<P>But this is not the ca&s;e. There are few parts of nature, which do not yield a picture&s;que eye &s;ome amu&s;ement.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Believe the mu&s;e,</L>

<L>The &s;eeds of grace are &s;own, profu&s;ely &s;own,</L>
<L>Even where we lea&s;t may hope.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>It is true, when &s;ome large tract of barren country <HI>interrupts</HI> our expectation, wound up in que&s;t of any particular &s;cene of grandeur, or beauty, we are apt to be a little peevi&s;h; and to expre&s;s our di&s;content in ha&s;ty ex|aggerated phra&s;e. But when there is no di&s;appointment in the ca&s;e, even &s;cenes the mo&s;t barren of beauty, will furni&s;h amu&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>Perhaps no part of England comes more under this de&s;cription, than that tract of bar|ren country, through which the great military road pa&s;&s;es from Newca&s;tle to Carli&s;le. It is a wa&s;te, with little interruption, through a &s;pace of forty miles. But even here, we have always &s;omething to amu&s;e the eye. The interchangeable patches of heath, and green-&s;ward make an agreeable variety. Often too on the&s;e va&s;t tracts of inter&s;ecting grounds we &s;ee beautiful lights, &s;oftening off along the &s;ides of hills: and often we &s;ee them adorned with cattle, flocks of &s;heep, heath-cocks, grous, plover, and flights of other wild-fowl. A group of cattle, &s;tanding in
<PB N="56" REF="69">
the &s;hade on the edge of a dark hill, and relieved by a lighter di&s;tance beyond them, will often make a compleat picture without any other accompaniment. In many other &s;ituations al&s;o we find them wonderfully plea&s;ing; and capable of making pictures amid&s;t all the deficiences of land&s;cape. Even a winding road it&s;elf is an object of beauty; while the richne&s;s of the heath on each &s;ide, with the little hillocs, and crumbling earth give many an excellent le&s;&s;on for a fore|ground. When we have no opportunity of examining the <HI>grand &s;cenery</HI> of nature, we have every where at lea&s;t the means of ob|&s;erving with what a <HI>multiplicity of parts,</HI> and yet with what <HI>general &s;implicity,</HI> &s;he covers every &s;urface.</P>
<P>But if we let the <HI>imagination</HI> loo&s;e, even &s;cenes like the&s;e, admini&s;ter great amu&s;ement. The imagination can plant hills; can form rivers&punc; and lakes in vallies; can build ca&s;tles, and abbeys; and if it find no other amu&s;e|ment, can dilate it&s;elf in va&s;t ideas of &s;pace.</P>
<P>But altho the picture&s;que traveller is &s;eldom di&s;appointed with <HI>pure nature,</HI> however rude,
<PB N="57" REF="70">
yet we cannot deny, but he is often offended with the productions of art. He is di&s;gu&s;ted with the formal &s;eparations of property&mdash;with hou&s;es, and towns, the haunts of men, which have much oftener a bad effect in land&s;cape, than a good one. He is frequently di&s;gu&s;ted al&s;o, when art aims more at beauty, than &s;he ought. How flat, and in&s;ipid is often the garden-&s;cene! how puerile, and ab&s;urd! the banks of the river how &s;mooth, and par|rallel! the lawn, and it's boundaries, how unlike nature! Even in the capital collec|tion of pictures, how &s;eldom does he find <HI>de&s;ign, compo&s;ition, expre&s;&s;ion, character,</HI> or <HI>har|mony</HI> either in <HI>light,</HI> or <HI>colouring!</HI> and how often does he drag through &s;aloons, and rooms of &s;tate, only to hear a catalogue of the names of ma&s;ters!</P>
<P>The more refined our ta&s;te grows from the <HI>&s;tudy of nature,</HI> the more in&s;ipid are the <HI>works of art.</HI> Few of it's efforts plea&s;e.

<HEAD>ESSAY III. ON THE ART OF SKETCHING LANDSCAPE.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB N="61" REF="73">ESSAY III.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>art of &s;ketching</HI> is to the picture&s;que traveller, what the art of writing is to the &s;cholar. Each is equally nece&s;&s;ary to fix, and communicate it's re&s;pective ideas.</P>
<P>Sketches <HI>are</HI> either taken from the <HI>imagi|nation,</HI> or from <HI>nature.</HI>&mdash;When the <HI>imaginary &s;ketch</HI> proceeds from the hands of a ma&s;ter, it is very valuable. It is his fir&s;t conception; which is commonly the &s;tronge&s;t, and the mo&s;t brilliant. The imagination of a painter, really great in his profe&s;&s;ion, is a magazine abound|ing with all the elegant forms, and &s;triking effects, which are to be found in nature. The&s;e, like a magician, he calls up at plea&s;ure with a wave of his hand; bringing before the eye, &s;ometimes a &s;cene from hi&s;tory, or ro|mance;
<PB N="62" REF="74">
and &s;ometimes from the inanimate parts of nature. And in the&s;e happy moments, when the enthu&s;ia&s;m of his art is upon him, he often produces from the glow of his imagi|nation, with a few bold &s;trokes, &s;uch wonder|ful effu&s;ions of genius, as the more &s;ober, and correct productions of his pencil cannot equal.</P>
<P>It will always however be under&s;tood, that &s;uch &s;ketches mu&s;t be <HI>examined</HI> al&s;o by an eye <HI>learned in the art,</HI> and accu&s;tomed to pictu|re&s;que ideas&mdash;an eye, that can take up the half-formed images, as the ma&s;ter leaves them; give them a new creation; and make up all that is not expre&s;&s;ed from it's own &s;tore-hou&s;e. &mdash;I &s;hall however dwell no longer on <HI>ima|ginary &s;ketching,</HI> as it hath but little relation to my pre&s;ent &s;ubject. Let me only add, that altho this e&s;&s;ay is meant chiefly to a&s;&s;i&s;t the picture&s;que traveller in taking <HI>views from nature,</HI> the method recommended, as far as it relates to <HI>execution,</HI> may equally be applied to <HI>imaginary &s;ketches.</HI></P>
<P>Your intention in taking <HI>views from nature,</HI> may either be to <HI>fix them in your own memory</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="75">
&mdash;or to <HI>convey, in &s;ome degree, your ideas to others.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to the former, when you meet a &s;cene you wi&s;h to &s;ketch, your fir&s;t con&s;i|deration is to get it in the be&s;t point of view. A few paces to the right, or left, make a great difference. The ground, which folds awkwardly here, appears to fold more ea&s;ily there: and that long blank curtain of the ca&s;tle, which is &s;o unplea&s;ing a circum&s;tance, as you &s;tand on one &s;ide, is agreeably broken by a buttre&s;s on another.</P>
<P>Having thus fixed your point of view, your next con&s;ideration, is, how to reduce it properly within the compa&s;s of your paper: for the &s;cale of <HI>nature</HI> being &s;o very different from <HI>your</HI> &s;cale, it is a matter of difficulty, without &s;ome experience, to make them coin|cide. If the land&s;cape before you is exten&s;ive, take care you do not include too much: it may perhaps be divided more commodiou&s;ly into two &s;ketches.&mdash;When you have fixed the portion of it, you mean to take, fix next on two or three principal points, which you may ju&s;t mark on your paper. This will en|able you the more ea&s;ily to a&s;certain the re|lative &s;ituation of the &s;everal objects.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="76">In &s;ketching, black-lead is the fir&s;t in&s;tru|ment commonly u&s;ed. Nothing glides &s;o volubly over paper, and executes an idea &s;o quickly.&mdash;It has be&s;ides, another advantage; it's grey tint corre&s;ponds better with a wa&s;h, than black, or red chalk, or any other pa&s;tile. &mdash;It admits al&s;o of ea&s;y correction.</P>
<P>The virtue of the&s;e ha&s;ty, black-lead &s;ketches con&s;i&s;ts in catching readily the <HI>cha|racteri&s;tic features</HI> of a &s;cene. Light and &s;hade are not attended to. It is enough if you expre&s;s <HI>general &s;hapes;</HI> and the relations, which the &s;everal inter&s;ections of a country bear to each other. A few lines drawn on the &s;pot, will do this. "Half a word, &s;ays Mr. Gray, fixed on, or near the &s;pot, is worth all our recollected ideas. When we tru&s;t to the picture, that objects draw of them&s;elves on the mind, we deceive our&s;elves. Without accurate, and particular ob&s;ervation, it is but ill-drawn at fir&s;t: the outlines are &s;oon blur|red: the colours, every day grow fainter; and at la&s;t, when we would produce it to any body, we are obliged to &s;upply it's defects
<PB N="65" REF="77">
with a few &s;trokes of our own imagination."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter to Mr. Palgrave, p. 272, 4to.</NOTE>&mdash; What Mr. Gray &s;ays, relates chiefly to <HI>verbal</HI> de&s;cription: but in <HI>lineal</HI> de&s;cription it is equally true. The leading ideas mu&s;t be fixed on the &s;pot: if left to the memory, they &s;oon evaporate.</P>
<P>The lines of black-lead, and indeed of any <HI>one</HI> in&s;trument, are &s;ubject to the great incon|venience of <HI>confounding di&s;tances.</HI> If there are two, or three di&s;tances in the land&s;cape, as each of them is expre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>&s;ame kind</HI> of line, the eye forgets the di&s;tinction, even in half a day's travelling; and all is confu&s;ion. To remedy this, a few written references, made on the &s;pot, are nece&s;&s;ary, if the land|&s;cape be at all complicated. The traveller &s;hould be accurate in this point, as the &s;pirit of his view depends much on the proper ob|&s;ervance of di&s;tances.&mdash;At his fir&s;t lei&s;ure however he will review his &s;ketch; add a few &s;trokes with a pen, to mark the near grounds; and by a &s;light wa&s;h of Indian ink, throw in a few general lights, and &s;hades, to keep all fixed, and in it's place.&mdash;A &s;ketch
<PB N="66" REF="78">
need not be carried farther, when it is in|tended merely to <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t our own memory.</HI></P>
<P>But when a &s;ketch is intended <HI>to convey, in &s;ome degree, our ideas to others,</HI> it is nece&s;|&s;ary, that it &s;hould be &s;omewhat more adorned. To <HI>us</HI> the &s;cene, familiar to our recollection, may be &s;ugge&s;ted by a few rough &s;trokes: but if you wi&s;h to rai&s;e the idea, <HI>where none exi&s;ted before,</HI> and to do it <HI>agreeably,</HI> there &s;hould be &s;ome <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> in your &s;ketch&mdash;a degree of <HI>correctne&s;s, and expre&s;&s;ion</HI> in the out-line&mdash; and &s;ome <HI>effect of light.</HI> A little <HI>ornament</HI> al&s;o from figures, and other circum&s;tances may be introduced. In &s;hort, it &s;hould be &s;o far dre&s;&s;ed, as to give &s;ome idea of a picture. I call this an <HI>adorned &s;ketch;</HI> and &s;hould &s;ketch nothing, that was not <HI>capable</HI> of being thus dre&s;&s;ed. An unpicture&s;que a&s;|&s;emblage of objects; and, in general, all untractable &s;ubjects, if it be nece&s;&s;ary to re|pre&s;ent them, may be given as plans, rather than as pictures.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I &s;hould advi&s;e the tra|veller by no means to work his <HI>adorned &s;ketch</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="79">
upon his <HI>original one.</HI> His fir&s;t &s;ketch is the &s;tandard, to which, in the ab&s;ence of nature, he mu&s;t at lea&s;t recur for his <HI>general ideas.</HI> By going over it again, the original ideas may be lo&s;t, and the whole thrown into con|fu&s;ion. Great ma&s;ters therefore always &s;et a high value on their &s;ketches from nature. On the &s;ame principle the picture&s;que tra|veller pre&s;erves his original &s;ketch, tho in it&s;elf of little value, to keep him within proper bounds.</P>
<P>This matter being &s;ettled, and the <HI>adorned &s;ketch</HI> begun anew, the fir&s;t point is to fix the <HI>compo&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>compo&s;ition,</HI> you &s;ay, is already fixed by the <HI>original &s;ketch.</HI></P>
<P>It is true: but &s;till it may admit many little alterations, by which the forms of objects may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted; and yet the re&s;em|blance not disfigured: as the &s;ame piece of mu&s;ic, performed by different ma&s;ters, and graced variou&s;ly by each, may yet con|tinue &s;till the &s;ame. We mu&s;t ever recol|lect that nature is mo&s;t defective in com|po&s;ition; and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be a little a&s;&s;i&s;ted. Her ideas are too va&s;t for picture&s;que u&s;e, without the re&s;traint of rules. Liberties however with
<PB N="68" REF="80">
truth mu&s;t be taken with caution: tho at the &s;ame time a di&s;tinction may be made between an <HI>object,</HI> and a <HI>&s;cene.</HI> If I give the &s;triking features of the <HI>ca&s;tle,</HI> or <HI>abbey,</HI> which is my <HI>object,</HI> I may be allowed &s;ome little liberty in bringing appendages (which are not e&s;&s;ential features) within the rules of my art. But in a <HI>&s;cene,</HI> the whole view becomes the portrait; and if I flatter here, I mu&s;t flatter with de|licacy.</P>
<P>But whether I repre&s;ent an <HI>object,</HI> or a <HI>&s;cene,</HI> I hold my&s;elf at perfect liberty, in the fir&s;t place, to di&s;po&s;e the <HI>foreground</HI> as I plea&s;e; re&s;trained only by the analogy of the country. I take up a tree here, and plant it there. I pare a knoll, or make an addition to it. I remove a piece of paling&mdash;a cottage&mdash;a wall&mdash; or any removeable object, which I di&s;like. In &s;hort, I do not &s;o much mean to exact a liberty of introducing what does not exi&s;t; as of making a few of tho&s;e &s;imple variations, of which all ground is ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible, and which time it&s;elf indeed is continually making. All this my art exacts:</P>
<Q><L>She rules the foreground; &s;he can &s;well, or &s;ink</L>
<L>It's &s;urface; here her leafy &s;kreen oppo&s;e,</L>
<L>And there withdraw; here part the varying greens,</L>

<L>As be&s;t befits the genius of the &s;cene.</L></Q>
<P>The foreground indeed is a mere &s;pot, compa|red with the exten&s;ion of the di&s;tance: in it&s;elf it is of trivial con&s;equence; and cannot well be called a <HI>feature of the &s;cene.</HI> And yet, tho &s;o little e&s;&s;ential in <HI>giving a likene&s;s,</HI> it is more &s;o than any other part in <HI>forming a compo|&s;ition.</HI> It re&s;embles tho&s;e deep tones in mu&s;ic, which give a value to all the lighter parts; and harmonize the whole.</P>
<P>As the foreground therefore is of &s;o much con&s;equence, <HI>begin</HI> your <HI>adorned &s;ketch</HI> with fixing this very material part. It is ea&s;ier to a&s;certain the &s;ituation of your foreground, as it lies &s;o near the bottom of your paper, than any other part; and this will tend to regulate every thing el&s;e. In your rough &s;ketch it has probably been inaccurately thrown in. You could not &s;o ea&s;ily a&s;cer|tain it, till you had gotten all your land&s;cape together. You might have carried it too high on your paper; or have brought it too low. As you have now the general &s;cheme of your land&s;cape before you, you may adju&s;t it properly; and give it it's due proportion. &mdash;I &s;hall add only, on the &s;ubject of fore|grounds,
<PB N="70" REF="82">
that you need not be very nice in fini&s;hing them, even when you mean to <HI>adorn</HI> your &s;ketches. In a fini&s;hed picture the fore|ground is a matter of great nicety: but in a &s;ketch little more is nece&s;&s;ary, than to produce the effect you de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Having fixed your foreground, you con&s;ider in the &s;ame way, tho with more caution, the other parts of your <HI>compo&s;ition.</HI> In a <HI>ha&s;ty tran&s;cript</HI> from nature, it is &s;ufficient to take the lines of the country ju&s;t as you find them: but in your <HI>adorned &s;ketch</HI> you mu&s;t grace them a little, where they run fal&s;e. You mu&s;t contrive to hide offen&s;ive parts with wood; to cover &s;uch as are too bald, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;hes; and to remove little objects, which in nature pu&s;h them&s;elves too much in &s;ight, and &s;erve only to introduce too many parts into your <HI>compo&s;ition.</HI> In this happy adju&s;t|ment the grand merit of your &s;ketch con&s;i&s;ts. No beauty of light, colouring, or execution can atone for the want of <HI>compo&s;ition.</HI> It is the foundation of all picture&s;que beauty. No finery of dre&s;s can &s;et off a per&s;on, who&s;e figure is awkward, and uncouth.</P>
<P>Having thus <HI>dige&s;ted the compo&s;ition</HI> of your <HI>adorned &s;ketch,</HI> which is done with black-lead,
<PB N="71" REF="83">
you proceed to give a &s;tronger outline to the foreground, and nearer parts. Some indeed u&s;e no outline, but what they freely work with a bru&s;h on their black-lead &s;ketch. This comes neare&s;t the idea of painting; and as it is the mo&s;t free, it is perhaps al&s;o the mo&s;t excellent method: but as a black-lead outline is but a feeble termination, it re|quires a greater force in the wa&s;h to produce an effect; and of cour&s;e more the hand of a ma&s;ter. The hand of a ma&s;ter indeed pro|duces an effect with the rude&s;t materials: but the&s;e precepts aim only at giving a few in|&s;tructions to the tyroes of the art; and &s;uch will perhaps make their out-line the mo&s;t effectually with a pen. As the pen is more determined than black-lead, it leaves le&s;s to the bru&s;h, which I think the more difficult in&s;trument.&mdash;Indian ink, (which may be heightened, or lowered to any degree of &s;trength, or weakne&s;s, &s;o as to touch both the nearer, and more di&s;tant grounds,) is the be&s;t ink you can u&s;e. You may give a &s;troke with it &s;o light as to confine even a remote di&s;tance; tho &s;uch a di&s;tance is perhaps be&s;t left in black-lead.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="84">But when we &s;peak of an <HI>out-line,</HI> we do not mean a <HI>&s;imple contour;</HI> which, (however nece&s;&s;ary in a correct figure,) would in land|&s;cape be formal. It is enough to mark with a few free touches of the pen, here and there, &s;ome of the breaks, and roughne&s;&s;es, in which the richne&s;s of an object con&s;i&s;ts. But you mu&s;t fir&s;t determine the &s;ituation of your lights, that you may mark the&s;e touches on the &s;hadowy &s;ide.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e free touches with a pen the chief characteri&s;tic is <HI>expre&s;&s;ion;</HI> or the art of giving each object, that peculiar touch, whether &s;mooth, or rough, which be&s;t expre&s;&s;es it's form. The art of painting, in it's highe&s;t perfection, cannot give the richne&s;s of nature. When we examine any natural form, we find the multiplicity of it's parts beyond the highe&s;t fini&s;hing: and indeed generally an attempt at the highe&s;t fini&s;hing would end in &s;tiffne&s;s. The painter is obliged therefore to deceive the eye by &s;ome natural tint, or expre&s;&s;ive touch, from which the imagination takes it's cue. How often do we &s;ee in the land&s;capes of Claude the full effect of di&s;tance; which, when examined clo&s;ely, con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;imple da&s;h, tinged with the hue of nature,
<PB N="73" REF="85">
intermixed with a few expre&s;&s;ive touches?&mdash; If then the&s;e expre&s;&s;ive touches are nece&s;&s;ary, where the ma&s;ter carries on the deception both in form, and colour; how nece&s;&s;ary mu&s;t they be in mere &s;ketches, in which colour, the great vehicle of deception, is removed?&mdash;The art however of giving tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ive marks with a pen, which impre&s;s ideas, is no common one. The inferior arti&s;t may give them by chance: but the ma&s;ter only gives them with preci&s;ion.&mdash;Yet a &s;ketch may have it's u&s;e, and even it's merit, without the&s;e &s;trokes of genius.</P>
<P>As the difficulty of u&s;ing the pen is &s;uch, it may perhaps be objected, that it is an improper in&s;trument for a tyro. It lo&s;es it's grace, if it have not a ready, and off-hand execution.</P>
<P>It is true: but what other in&s;trument &s;hall we put into his hands, that will do better? His black-lead, his bru&s;h, whatever he touches, will be unma&s;terly. But my chief rea&s;on for putting a pen into his hands, is, that without a pen it will be difficult for him to pre&s;erve his outline, and di&s;tances. His touches with a pen may be unma&s;terly, we allow: but &s;till they will pre&s;erve <HI>keeping</HI> in his land&s;cape,
<PB N="74" REF="86">
without which the whole will be a blot of confu&s;ion.&mdash;Nor is it perhaps &s;o difficult to obtain &s;ome little freedom with a pen. I have &s;een a&s;&s;iduity, attended with but little genius, make a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the u&s;e of this in&s;trument; and produce an effect by no means di&s;plea&s;ing.&mdash;If the drawing be large, I &s;hould recommend a reed-pen, which runs more freely over paper.</P>
<P>When the out-line is thus drawn, it re|mains to add light, and &s;hade. In this ope|ration the effect of a <HI>wa&s;h</HI> is much better, than of lines hatched with a pen. A bru&s;h will do more in one &s;troke, and generally more effectually, than a pen can do in twenty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I have &s;eldom &s;een any drawings etched with a pen, that plea&s;ed me.

Indian ink; and perhaps a little bi&s;tre, or burnt umber. With the former we give that greyi&s;h tinge, which belongs to the &s;ky, and di&s;tant objects; and with the latter (mixed more, or le&s;s with Indian ink) tho&s;e warm touches, which belong to the foreground. Indian ink however alone makes a good wa&s;h both for the foreground, and di&s;tance.</P>
<P>But mere <HI>light and &s;hade</HI> are not &s;ufficient: &s;omething of <HI>effect</HI> al&s;o &s;hould be aimed at in the <HI>adorned &s;ketch.</HI> Mere light and &s;hade propo&s;e only the <HI>&s;imple illumination</HI> of objects. <HI>Effect,</HI> by balancing <HI>large ma&s;&s;es</HI> of each, gives the whole a greater force.&mdash;Now tho in the exhibitions of nature, we commonly find only the <HI>&s;imple illumination</HI> of objects; yet as we often do meet with <HI>grand effects</HI> al&s;o, we have &s;ufficient authority to u&s;e them: for under the&s;e circum&s;tances we &s;ee nature in her be&s;t attire, in which it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to de&s;cribe her.</P>
<P>As to giving rules for the production of effect, the &s;ubject admits only the <HI>mo&s;t gene|ral.</HI> There mu&s;t be a &s;trong oppo&s;ition of light and &s;hade; in which the &s;ky, as well as the land&s;cape, mu&s;t combine. But in what
<PB N="76" REF="90">
way this oppo&s;ition mu&s;t be varied&mdash;where the full tone of &s;hade mu&s;t prevail&mdash;where the full effu&s;ion of light&mdash;or where the various degrees of each&mdash;depends intirely on the cir|cum&s;tance of the <HI>compo&s;ition.</HI> All you can do, is to examine your drawing (yet in it's naked out-line) with care; and endeavour to find out where the force of the light will have the be&s;t effect. But this depends more on <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> than on <HI>rule.</HI></P>
<P>One thing both in light and &s;hade &s;hould be ob&s;erved, e&s;pecially in the former&mdash;and that is <HI>gradation;</HI> which gives a force beyond what a glaring di&s;play of light can give. The effect of light, which falls on the &s;tone, produced as an illu&s;tration of this idea, would not be &s;o great, unle&s;s it <HI>graduated</HI> into &s;hade. &mdash;In the following &s;tanza Mr. Gray has with great beauty, and propriety, illu&s;trated the vici&s;&s;itudes of life by the principles of picture&s;que effect.</P>

<L>And, blended, form with artful &s;trife,</L>
<L>The &s;trength, and harmony of life.</L></Q>
<P><PB REF="91"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="92">I may farther add, that the production of an <HI>effect</HI> is particularly nece&s;&s;ary in <HI>drawing.</HI> In <HI>painting,</HI> colour in &s;ome degree makes up the deficency: but in &s;imple clair-ob&s;cure there is no &s;uccedaneum. It's force depends on effect; the virtue of which is &s;uch, that it will give a value even to a barren &s;ubject. Like &s;triking the chords of a mu&s;ical in&s;tru|ment, it will produce harmony, without any richne&s;s of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>It is farther to be ob&s;erved, that when objects <HI>are in &s;hadow,</HI> the light, (as it is then a reflected one,) falls on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide to that, on which it falls, when they are in|lightened.</P>
<P>In <HI>adorning your &s;ketch,</HI> a figure, or two may be introduced with propriety. By figures I mean moving objects, as waggons, and boats, as well as cattle, and men. But they &s;hould be introduced &s;paringly. In profu&s;ion they are affected. Their chief u&s;e is, to mark a road&mdash;to break a piece of foreground&mdash;to point out the horizon in a &s;ea-view&mdash;or to carry off the di&s;tance of retiring water by the contra&s;t of a dark &s;ail, not quite &s;o di&s;tant, placed before it. But in figures thus de&s;igned for the ornament of a &s;ketch, a few &s;light
<PB N="78" REF="93">
touches are &s;ufficient. Attempts at fini&s;hing offend.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the preceding e&s;&s;ay.</NOTE></P>
<P>Among trees, little di&s;tinction need be made, unle&s;s you introduce the pine, or the cypre&s;s, or &s;ome other &s;ingular form. The oak, the a&s;h, and the elm, which bear a di&s;tant re&s;em|blance to each other, may all be characterized alike. In a &s;ketch, it is enough to mark <HI>a tree.</HI> One di&s;tinction indeed is often nece&s;&s;ary even in &s;ketches; and that is, between full-leaved trees, and tho&s;e of &s;traggling ramification. In compo&s;ition we have often occa&s;ion for both, and therefore the hand &s;hould be u&s;ed readily to execute either. If we have a general idea of the oak, for in&s;tance, as a light tree; and of the beech as a heavy one, it is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>It adds, I think, to the beauty of a &s;ketch to &s;tain the paper &s;lightly with a reddi&s;h, or yellowi&s;h tinge; the u&s;e of which is to give a more plea&s;ing tint to the ground of the drawing by taking away the glare of the paper. It adds al&s;o, if it be not too &s;trong, a degree of harmony to the rawne&s;s of black, and white.
<PB REF="94">

<PB N="79" REF="95">
This tinge may be laid on, either before, or after the drawing is made. In general, I &s;hould prefer the latter method; becau&s;e, while the drawing is yet on white paper, you may correct it with a &s;ponge, dipt in water; which will, in a good degree, efface Indian ink. But if you rub out any part, <HI>after</HI> the drawing is &s;tained, you cannot ea&s;ily lay the &s;tain again upon the rubbed part without the appearance of a patch.</P>
<P>Some chu&s;e rather to add a little colour to their &s;ketches. My in&s;tructions attempt not the art of mixing a variety of tints; and fini&s;hing a drawing from nature; which is generally executed in colours from the begin|ning, without any u&s;e of Indian ink; except as a grey tint, uniting with other colours. This indeed, when cha&s;tly executed, (which is not often the ca&s;e) exceeds in beauty every other &s;pecies of drawing. It is however be|yond my &s;kill to give any in&s;truction for this mode of drawing. All I mean, is only to offer a mode&s;t way of tinting a &s;ketch already fini&s;h|ed in Indian ink. By the addition of a little colour I mean only to give &s;ome di&s;tinction
<PB N="80" REF="96">
to objects; and introduce rather a gayer &s;tile into a land&s;cape.</P>
<P>When you have fini&s;hed your &s;ketch there|fore with Indian ink, as far as you propo&s;e, tinge the whole over with &s;ome light horizon hue. It may be the ro&s;y tint of morning; or the more ruddy one of evening; or it may incline more to a yellowi&s;h, or a greyi&s;h ca&s;t. As a &s;pecimen an evening hue is given. The fir&s;t tint you &s;pread over your drawing, is compo&s;ed of light red, and oker, which make an orange. It may incline to one, or the other, as you chu&s;e. In this example it in|clines rather to the former. By wa&s;hing this tint over your <HI>whole drawing,</HI> you lay a foun|dation for harmony. When this wa&s;h is nearly dry, repeat it in the horizon; &s;oftening it off into the &s;ky, as you a&s;cend.&mdash;Take next a purple tint, compo&s;ed of lake, and blue, inclining rather to the former; and with this, when your fir&s;t wa&s;h is dry, form your clouds; and then &s;pread it, as you did the fir&s;t tint, over your <HI>whole drawing,</HI> except where you leave the horizon-tint. This &s;till &s;trengthens the idea of harmony. Your &s;ky, and di&s;tance are now fini&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="97">You proceed next to your <HI>middle,</HI> and <HI>fore|grounds;</HI> in both which you di&s;tingui&s;h between the <HI>&s;oil,</HI> and the vegetation. Wa&s;h the <HI>middle grounds</HI> with a little umber. This will be &s;ufficient for the <HI>&s;oil.</HI> The <HI>&s;oil</HI> of the <HI>fore|ground</HI> you may go over with a little light red. The <HI>vegetation</HI> of each may be wa&s;hed with a green, compo&s;ed of blue, and oker; adding a little more oker as you proceed nearer the eye; and on the neare&s;t grounds a little burnt terra Sienna. This is &s;ufficient for the <HI>middle grounds.</HI> The <HI>foreground</HI> may farther want a little heightening both in the <HI>&s;oil,</HI> and <HI>vegeta|tion.</HI> In the <HI>&s;oil</HI> it may be given in the lights with burnt terra Sienna; mixing in the &s;hadows a little lake: and in the <HI>vegetation</HI> with gall|&s;tone; touched in places, and occa&s;ionally varied, with a little burnt terra Sienna.</P>
<P>Trees on the foreground are con&s;idered as a part of it; and their foliage may be co|loured like the vegetation in their neigh|bourhood. Their &s;tems may be touched with burnt terra Sienna.&mdash;Trees, in middle di&s;tances are darker than the lawns, on which they &s;tand. They mu&s;t therefore be touched twice over with the tint, which is given only once to the lawn.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="98">If you repre&s;ent clouds with bright edges, the edges mu&s;t be left in the fir&s;t orange; while the tint over the other part of the horizon is repeated, as was mentioned before.</P>
<P>A lowering, cloudy &s;ky is repre&s;ented by, what is called, a grey tint, compo&s;ed of lake, blue, and oker. As the &s;hadow deepens, the tint &s;hould incline more to blue.</P>
<P>The &s;everal tints mentioned in the above proce&s;s, may perhaps the mo&s;t ea&s;ily be mixed before you begin; e&s;pecially if your drawing be large. Rub the raw colours in little &s;aucers: keep them clean, and di&s;tinct; and from them, mix your tints in other little ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, that the <HI>&s;trength of the colouring</HI> you give your &s;ketch, mu&s;t depend on the height, to which you have carried the Indian ink <HI>fini&s;hing.</HI> If it be only a &s;light &s;ketch, it will bear only a light wa&s;h of colour.</P>
<P>This mode however of tinting a drawing, even when you tint it as high as the&s;e in&s;truc|tions reach, is by no means calculated to produce any great effect of colouring: but it is at lea&s;t &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve harmony. <HI>This</HI> you may pre&s;erve: an <HI>effect of colouring</HI> you cannot ea&s;ily attain. It is &s;omething how|ever
<PB N="83" REF="99">
to avoid a di&s;agreeable exce&s;s; and there is nothing &s;urely &s;o di&s;agreeable to a correct eye as a tinted drawing (&s;uch as we often &s;ee) in which greens, and blues, and reds, and yellows are daubed without any attention to harmony. It is to the picture&s;que eye, what a di&s;cord of har&s;h notes is to a mu&s;ical ear.</P>
<P>But the advocate for the&s;e glaring tints may perhaps &s;ay, he does not make his &s;ky more blue than nature; nor his gra&s;s, and trees more green.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;o: but unle&s;s he could work up his drawing with the fini&s;hing of nature, he will find the effect very unequal. Nature mixes a variety of &s;emitints with her brighte&s;t colours: and tho the eye cannot readily &s;epa|rate them, they have a general cha&s;tizing effect; and keep the &s;everal tints of land&s;cape within proper bounds, which a glare of deep colours cannot do. Be&s;ides, this cha&s;tizing hue is produced in nature by numberle&s;s little &s;hadows, beyond the attention of art, which &s;he throws on leaves, and piles of gra&s;s, and every other minute object; all which, tho not ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed in <HI>particulars,</HI> tells <HI>in the whole,</HI> and is continually cha&s;tening the hues of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="100">Before I conclude the&s;e remarks on &s;ketch|ing, it may be u&s;eful to add a few words, and but a few, on per&s;pective. The nicer parts of it contain many difficulties; and are of little u&s;e in common land&s;cape: but as a building, now and then, occurs, which requires &s;ome little knowledge of per&s;pective, the &s;ubject &s;hould not be left wholly un|touched.</P>
<P>If a building &s;tand exactly in front, none of it's lines can go off in per&s;pective: but if it &s;tand with a corner to the eye, as picture&s;que buildings commonly do, it's lines will appear to recede. In what manner they recede, the following mechanical method may explain.</P>
<P>Hold horizontally between your eye, and the building you draw, a flat ruler, till you &s;ee only the edge of it. Where it cuts the <HI>neare&s;t perpendicular</HI> of the building, which you have already ju&s;t traced on your paper, make a <HI>mark;</HI> and draw a &s;light line through that part, parallel with the bottom of your paper. This is called the <HI>horizontal line,</HI> and regulates the whole per&s;pective. Ob&s;erve next the angle, which the uppermo&s;t of the&s;e reced|ing
<PB REF="101">
<FIGURE>

<PB N="85" REF="102">
lines makes with the <HI>neare&s;t perpendicular</HI> of the building; and continue that receding line till it meet the <HI>horizontal line.</HI> From the point, where it inter&s;ects, draw another line to the bottom of the <HI>neare&s;t perpendicular.</HI> This gives you the per&s;pective of the ba&s;e. In the &s;ame manner all the lines, which recede, on both &s;ides, of the building; as well above, as below the <HI>horizontal line</HI>&mdash;windows, doors, and projections of every kind, (on the &s;ame plane)&mdash;are regulated. The points on the <HI>horizontal line,</HI> in which the&s;e receding lines unite, are called <HI>points of &s;ight.</HI></P>
<P>After all, however, from the mode of &s;ketching here recommended (which is as far as I &s;hould wi&s;h to recommend drawing land&s;cape to tho&s;e, who draw only for amu&s;e|ment) no great degree of accuracy can be expected. General ideas only mu&s;t be looked for; not the peculiarities of portrait. It admits the winding river&mdash;the &s;hooting pro|montory &mdash;the ca&s;tle&mdash;the abbey&mdash;the flat di&s;|tance &mdash;and the mountain melting into the horizon. It admits too the relation, which all the&s;e parts bear to each other. But it
<PB N="86" REF="103">
de&s;cends not to the minutiae of objects. The fringed bank of the river&mdash;the Gothic ornaments of the abbey&mdash;the cha&s;ms, and frac|tures of the rock, and ca&s;tle&mdash;and every little object along the vale, it pretends not to delineate with exactne&s;s. All this is the pro|vince of the fini&s;hed drawing, and the pic|ture; in which the arti&s;t conveys an idea of each minute feature of the country he <HI>delineates,</HI> or <HI>imagines.</HI> But <HI>high fini&s;hing,</HI> as I have before ob&s;erved, belongs only to a ma&s;ter, who can give <HI>expre&s;&s;ive touches.</HI> The di&s;ciple, whom I am in&s;tructing, and whom I in&s;truct only from my own experience, mu&s;t have humbler views; and can hardly expect to plea&s;e, if he go farther than a &s;ketch, <HI>adorned</HI> as hath been here de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Many gentlemen, who draw for amu&s;e|ment, employ their lei&s;ure on human figures, animal life, portrait, perhaps hi&s;tory. Here and there a man of genius makes &s;ome pro|ficiency in the&s;e difficult branches of the art: but I have rarely &s;een any, who do. Di&s;|torted faces, and di&s;located limbs, I have &s;een in abundance: and no wonder; for the &s;cience of anatomy, <HI>even</HI> as it regards painting, is with difficulty attained; and few who have

&s;tudied it their whole lives, have acquired perfection.</P>
<P>Others again, who draw for amu&s;ement, go &s;o far as to handle the pallet.

Painting is both a &s;cience, and an art; and if &s;o very few attain perfection, who &s;pend a life-time on it, what can be expected from tho&s;e, who &s;pend only their lei&s;ure? The very few gentlemen-arti&s;ts, who excel in <HI>paint|ing,</HI> &s;carce afford encouragement for common practice.</P>
<P>But the <HI>art of &s;ketching land&s;cape</HI> is attainable by a man of bu&s;ine&s;s; and it is certainly more u&s;eful; and, I &s;hould imagine, more amu&s;ing, to attain <HI>&s;ome degree</HI> of excellence in an in|ferior branch, than to be a mere bungler in a &s;uperior. Even if you &s;hould not excel in <HI>execution</HI> (which indeed you can hardly ex|pect) you may at lea&s;t by bringing home the delineation of a fine country, dignify an in|different
<PB N="88" REF="105">
s;ketch. You may plea&s;e your&s;elf by admini&s;tring &s;trongly to recollection: and you may plea&s;e others by conveying your ideas more di&s;tinctly in an ordinary &s;ketch, than in the be&s;t language.</P>

<LIST>
<ITEM>Line 1 INTRODUCTION, and addre&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 26 A clo&s;e attention to the various &s;cenes of nature recommended; and to the &s;e|veral circum&s;tances, under which they appear.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 78 A facility al&s;o in copying the different <HI>parts</HI> of nature &s;hould be attained, before the young arti&s;t attempts a <HI>whole.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 90 This proce&s;s will al&s;o be a kind of <HI>te&s;t.</HI> No one can make any progre&s;s, who&s;e ima|gination is not fired with the &s;cenes of nature.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 107 On a &s;uppo&s;ition, that the arti&s;t is enamoured with his &s;ubject; and is well ver&s;ed in copying the parts of nature, he begins
<PB N="ii" REF="107">
to combine, and form tho&s;e parts into the &s;ubjects of land&s;cape. He pays his fir&s;t attention to <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> or to the bringing together of &s;uch objects, as are &s;uited to his &s;ubject; not mixing trivial objects with grand &s;cenes; but pre&s;erving the <HI>character</HI> of his &s;ubject, whatever it may be.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 133 The different parts of his land&s;cape mu&s;t next be &s;tudiou&s;ly arranged, and put together in a picture&s;que manner. This is the work of <HI>di&s;po&s;ition;</HI> or, as it is &s;ometimes called, <HI>compo&s;ition.</HI> No rules can be given for this arrangement, but the experience of a nice eye: for tho nature &s;eldom pre&s;ents a compleat compo&s;ition, yet we every where &s;ee in her works beautiful arrangements of parts; which we ought to &s;tudy with great attention.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 149 In general, a land&s;cape is compo&s;ed of three parts&mdash;a foreground&mdash;a middle ground&mdash; and a di&s;tance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 153 Yet this is not a univer&s;al rule. A <HI>balance of parts</HI> however there &s;hould always be; tho &s;ometimes tho&s;e parts may be few.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 166 It is a great error in land&s;cape-painters, to lo&s;e the <HI>&s;implicity</HI> of a whole, under the idea of giving <HI>variety.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="iii" REF="108">Line 172 Some <HI>particular &s;cene,</HI> therefore, or <HI>leading &s;ubject</HI> &s;hould always be cho&s;en; to which the parts &s;hould be &s;ub&s;ervient.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 195 In balancing a land&s;cape, a &s;pacious fore|ground will admit a &s;mall thread of di&s;|tance: but the rever&s;e is a bad propor|tion. In every land&s;cape there <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be a con&s;iderable foreground.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 206 This theory is illu&s;trated by the view of a <HI>di&s;proportioned di&s;tance.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 233 An objection an&s;wered, why va&s;t di&s;tances, tho un&s;upported by foregrounds, may plea&s;e <HI>in nature,</HI> and yet offend <HI>in repre|&s;entation.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 256 But tho the &s;everal parts of land&s;cape may be <HI>well ballanced,</HI> and adju&s;ted; yet &s;till without <HI>contra&s;t in the parts,</HI> there will be a great deficiency. At the &s;ame time this contra&s;t mu&s;t be ea&s;y, and natural.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 276 Such pictures, as are painted from fancy, are the mo&s;t plea&s;ing efforts of genius. But if an untoward &s;ubject be given, the arti&s;t, mu&s;t endeavour to conceal, and vary the unaccommodating parts. The foreground he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> claim as his own.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 298 But if nature be the &s;ource of all beauty, it may be objected, that imaginary views can have little merit. The objection has weight, if the imaginary view be not
<PB N="iv" REF="109">
formed from the &s;elected parts of nature; but if it be, it is nature &s;till.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 312 The arti&s;t having thus adju&s;ted his forms, and di&s;po&s;ition; conceives next the be&s;t effect of light; and when he has thus laid the foundation of his picture, proceeds to colouring.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 325 The author avoids giving rules for colouring, which are learned chiefly by practice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 331 He ju&s;t touches on the theory of colours.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 352 Arti&s;ts, with equally good effect, &s;ometimes blend them on their pallet; and &s;ome|times &s;pread them raw on their canvas.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 362 In colouring, the &s;ky gives the ruling tint to the land&s;cape: and the hue of the whole, whether rich, or &s;ober, mu&s;t be harmo|nious.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 406 A predominancy of &s;hade has the be&s;t effect.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 439 But light, tho it &s;hould not be &s;cattered, &s;hould not be collected, as it were, into a focus.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 444 The effect of <HI>gradation</HI> illu&s;trated by the co|louring of cattle.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 463 Of the di&s;po&s;ition of light.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 488 Of the <HI>general harmony</HI> of the whole.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 499 A method propo&s;ed of examining a picture with regard to it's <HI>general harmony.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 511 The &s;cientific part being clo&s;ed, all that can be &s;aid with regard to <HI>execution,</HI> is, that, as there are various modes of it, every
<PB N="v" REF="110">
arti&s;t ought to adopt his own, or el&s;e he becomes a &s;ervile imitator. On the whole, the bold free method recommended; which aims at giving the <HI>character</HI> of objects, rather than the <HI>minute detail.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 545 Rules given with regard to figures. Hi&s;tory in miniature, introduced in land&s;cape, condemned. Figures &s;hould be &s;uited to the &s;cene.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 600 Rules to be ob&s;erved, in the introduction of birds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 625 An exhibition is the true&s;t te&s;t of excellence; where the picture receives it's &s;tamp, and value not from the airs of coxcombs; but from the judgment of men of ta&s;te, and &s;cience.</ITEM>

<L>THAT Art, which gives the practis'd pencil pow'r</L>
<L>To rival Nature's graces; to combine</L>
<L>In one harmonious whole her &s;catter'd charms,</L>
<L>And o'er them fling appropriate force of light,</L>

<L>Her aid, and give that free colloquial flow,</L>
<L>Which be&s;t befits the plain preceptive &s;ong.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To thee, thus aided, let me dare to &s;ing,</L>
<L>Judicious LOCKE; who from great Nature's realms <MILESTONE N="10"></L>
<L>Ha&s;t cull'd her lovelie&s;t features, and arrang'd</L>
<L>In thy rich mem'ry's &s;torehou&s;e: Thou, who&s;e glance,</L>
<L>Practis'd in truth and &s;ymmetry, can trace</L>
<L>In every latent touch, each Ma&s;ter's hand,</L>

<L>The plaudit, which, if Nature fir&s;t approve,</L>
<L>Then, and then only, thou wilt deign to yield.<MILESTONE N="25"></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fir&s;t to the youthful arti&s;t I addre&s;s</L>
<L>This leading precept: Let not inborn pride,</L>
<L>Pre&s;uming on thy own inventive powers,</L>
<L>Mi&s;lead thine eye from Nature. She mu&s;t reign</L>
<L>Great architype in all: Trace then with care <MILESTONE N="30"></L>
<L>Her varied walks; ob&s;erve how &s;he upheaves</L>
<L>The mountain's tow'ring brow; on its rough &s;ides</L>
<L>How broad the &s;hadow falls, what different hues</L>
<L>Inve&s;t its glimm'ring &s;urface. Next &s;urvey</L>
<L>The di&s;tant lake; &s;o &s;een, a &s;hining &s;pot:<MILESTONE N="35"></L>
<L>But when approaching nearer, how it flings</L>
<L>Its &s;weeping curves around the &s;hooting cliffs.</L>
<L>Mark every &s;hade its Proteus &s;hape a&s;&s;umes</L>
<L>From motion and from re&s;t; and how the forms</L>
<L>Of tufted woods, and beetling rocks, and tow'rs <MILESTONE N="40"></L>
<L>Of ruin'd ca&s;tles, from the &s;mooth expan&s;e,</L>
<L>Shade an&s;w'ring &s;hade, inverted meet the eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From mountains hie thee to the fore&s;t-&s;cene.</L>
<L>Remark the form, the foliage of each tree,</L>
<L>And what its leading feature: View the oak; <MILESTONE N="45"></L>
<L>Its ma&s;&s;y limbs, its maje&s;ty of &s;hade;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="114">The pendent birch; the beech of many a &s;tem;</L>
<L>The lighter a&s;h; and all their changeful hues</L>
<L>In &s;pring or autumn, ru&s;&s;et, green, or grey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next wander by the river's mazy bank:<MILESTONE N="50"></L>
<L>See where it dimpling glides; or bri&s;kly where</L>
<L>Its whirling eddies &s;parkle round the rock;</L>
<L>Or where, with headlong rage, it da&s;hes down</L>
<L>Some fractur'd cha&s;m, till all its fury &s;pent,</L>
<L>It &s;inks to &s;leep, a &s;ilent &s;tagnant pool,<MILESTONE N="55"></L>
<L>Dark, tho' tran&s;lucent, from the mantling &s;hade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now give thy view more ample range: explore</L>
<L>The va&s;t expan&s;e of ocean; &s;ee, when calm,</L>
<L>What Iris-hues of purple, green, and gold,</L>
<L>Play on its gla&s;&s;y &s;urface; and when vext <MILESTONE N="60"></L>
<L>With &s;torms, what depth of billowy &s;hade, with light</L>
<L>Of curling foam contra&s;ted. View the cliffs;</L>
<L>The lonely beacon, and the di&s;tant coa&s;t,</L>
<L>In mi&s;ts array'd, ju&s;t heaving into &s;ight</L>
<L>Above the dim horizon; where the &s;ail <MILESTONE N="65"></L>
<L>Appears con&s;picuous in the lengthen'd gleam.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With &s;tudious eye examine next the arch</L>
<L>Etherial; mark each &s;loating cloud; its form,</L>
<L>Its varied colour; and what ma&s;s of &s;hade</L>
<L>It gives the &s;cene below, pregnant with change <MILESTONE N="70"></L>
<L>Perpetual, from the morning's purple dawn,</L>
<L>Till the la&s;t glimm'ring ray of ru&s;&s;et eve.</L>
<L>Mark how the &s;un-beam, &s;teep'd in morning-dew,</L>
<L>Beneath each jutting promontory flings</L>
<L>A darker &s;hade; while brighten'd with the ray <MILESTONE N="75"></L>
<L>Of &s;ultry noon, not yet entirely quench'd,</L>
<L>The evening-&s;hadow le&s;s opaquely falls.</L>

<L>A <HI>whole,</HI> till every <HI>part</HI> be well conceived.</L>
<L>The tongue that awes a &s;enate with its force,</L>
<L>Once li&s;p'd in &s;yllables, or e'er it pour'd</L>
<L>Its glowing periods, warm with patriot-fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length matur'd, &s;tand forth for hone&s;t Fame <MILESTONE N="85"></L>
<L>A candidate. Some noble theme &s;elect</L>
<L>From Nature's choice&s;t &s;cenes; and &s;ketch that theme</L>
<L>With firm, but ea&s;y line; then if my &s;ong</L>

<HEAD>NOTES ON THE FOREGOING POEM.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Line 34 SOME perhaps may object to the word <HI>glimmering:</HI> but whoever has ob&s;erved the playing lights, and colours, which often inve&s;t the &s;ummits of mountains, will not think the epithet improper.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 45 <HI>What it's leading feature;</HI> that is, the <HI>par|ticular character</HI> of the tree. The dif|ferent &s;hape of the leaves, and the dif|ferent mode of &s;preading it's branches, give every tree, a <HI>di&s;tinct form,</HI> or <HI>character.</HI> At a little di&s;tance you ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h the oak from the a&s;h; and the a&s;h from the beech. It is this <HI>general form,</HI> not any <HI>particular detail,</HI> which the arti&s;t is in&s;tructed to get by heart. The &s;ame remark holds with
<PB N="26" REF="136">
regard to other parts of nature. The&s;e <HI>general forms</HI> may be called the <HI>painter's alphabet.</HI> By the&s;e he learns to read her works; and al&s;o to make them intelli|gible to others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 61 <HI>With light of curling foam contra&s;ted.</HI> The progre&s;s of each wave is this. Beneath the frothy curl, when it ri&s;es between the eye, and the light, the colour is pale green, which brightens from the ba&s;e towards the &s;ummit. When a wave &s;ub&s;ides, the &s;ummit falling into the ba&s;e, extends, and rai&s;es it; and the &s;ides running off from the centre, that part of the water which meets the &s;uc|ceeding wave, &s;prings upward from the &s;hock; the top forms into foam, and rolling over falls down the &s;ide, which has been &s;hocked; pre&s;enting if the water be much agitated, the idea of a ca&s;cade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 77 <HI>The evening-&s;hadow le&s;s opaquely falls.</HI> It is not often ob&s;erved by land&s;cape-painters, tho it certainly de&s;erves ob&s;ervation, that the morning-&s;hadows are darker than tho&s;e of the evening.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 101 <HI>If the big thought &s;eem more than art can paint.</HI> It is always a &s;ign of genius to be di&s;|&s;atisfied with our own efforts; and to conceive more than we can expre&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="27" REF="137">Line 146 <HI>De&s;ign pre&s;ents the general &s;ubject, di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> &amp;c. Some writers on the art of painting have varied this divi&s;ion. But it &s;eems mo&s;t proper, I think, to give the &s;e|lection of the elements of land&s;cape&mdash; the a&s;&s;embling of rocks, mountains, ca|taracts, and other objects to <HI>de&s;ign:</HI> while <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> is properly employed in the local arrangement of them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 149 The <HI>general</HI> compo&s;ition of a land&s;cape con|&s;i&s;ts of three parts&mdash;the foreground&mdash;the &s;econd ground&mdash;and the di&s;tance. No rule can be given for proportioning the&s;e parts to each other. There are ten thou&s;and beautiful proportions; from which the eye of ta&s;te mu&s;t &s;elect a good one. The foreground mu&s;t always be con&s;iderable&mdash;in &s;ome ca&s;es, ample. It is the very ba&s;is, and foundation of the whole.&mdash;Nor is it a bad rule, I think, that &s;ome part of the foreground &s;hould be the highe&s;t part of the picture. In rocky, and mountainous views this is ea&s;y, and has generally a good effect. And &s;ometimes even when a country is more level, a tree on the foreground, carried higher than the re&s;t of the land|&s;cape, an&s;wers the end. At the &s;ame time in many &s;pecies of land&s;cape this
<PB N="28" REF="138">
rule cannot ea&s;ily be adapted: nor is it by any means e&s;&s;ential.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 164 <HI>Waterlo, like thine.</HI> The &s;ubjects of this ma&s;ter &s;eldom went beyond &s;ome little fore&s;t-view. He has etched a great num|ber of prints in this &s;tile of land&s;cape; which for the beauty of the trees in par|ticular, are much admired.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 173 <HI>Land&s;capes, that knew no leading &s;ubject.</HI> There is not a rule in land&s;cape-painting more neglected; or that ought more to be ob|&s;erved, than what relates to a <HI>leading-&s;ubject.</HI> By the leading &s;ubject, we mean, what <HI>characterizes the &s;cene.</HI> We often &s;ee a land&s;cape, which comes under no denomination. Is it the &s;cenery about a ruin? Is it a lake-&s;cene? Is it a river-&s;cene? No: but it is a jumble of all together. Some leading &s;ubject there|fore is required in every land&s;cape, which forms it's character; and to which the painter
<Q><L>&mdash; is confined by rules,</L>
<L>As fixed, and rigid as the tragic bard.</L></Q>
when the land&s;cape takes it's character from a ruin, or other object on the foreground, the <HI>di&s;tance</HI> introduced, is merely an ap|pendage; and mu&s;t plainly appear to be an under-part; not interfering with the
<PB N="29" REF="139">
&s;ubject of the piece. But mo&s;t commonly the &s;cene, or leading-&s;ubject of the pic|ture, occupies the middle di&s;tance. In this ca&s;e, the <HI>foreground</HI> becomes the appendage; and without any &s;triking object to attract the eye, mu&s;t plainly &s;hew, that it is intended only to intro|duce the leading-&s;ubject with more ad|vantage.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 190 Thus, in a fore&s;t-&s;cene, the woods and lawns are the leading-&s;ubject. If the piece will admit it, a hill, or a lake, may be admit|ted in <HI>remote di&s;tance:</HI> but they mu&s;t be introduced, only as the epi&s;odes in a poem, to &s;et off the main &s;ubject. They mu&s;t not interfere with it; but be <HI>far removed.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 197 <HI>And tho a glance.</HI> It is certain, in fact, that a con&s;iderable foreground, with a glance of di&s;tance, will make a better picture, than a wide di&s;tance, &s;et off only with a meagre foreground: and yet I doubt whether an adequate rea&s;on can be given; unle&s;s it be founded on what hath already been advanced, that we con&s;ider the fore|ground as the <HI>ba&s;is, and foundation of the whole picture.</HI> So that if it is not con&s;i|derable in all circum&s;tances, and exten&s;ive in &s;ome, there &s;eems a defect.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="30" REF="140">Line 280 <HI>A novel whole.</HI> The imaginary-view, formed on a judicious &s;election, and arrangement of the parts of nature, has a better chance of making a good picture, than a view taken in the whole from any natural &s;cene. Not only the lines, and objects of the na|tural &s;cene rarely admit a happy compo&s;i|tion; but the <HI>character</HI> of it is &s;eldom throughout pre&s;erved. Whether it be <HI>&s;u|blime,</HI> or <HI>beautiful,</HI> there is generally &s;ome|thing mixed with it of a nature un&s;uitable to it. All this the exhibition of fancy rec|tifies, when in the hands of a ma&s;ter. Nor does he claim any thing, but what the poet, and he are equally allowed. Where is the &s;tory in real life, on which the poet can form either an epic, or a drama, unle&s;s heightened by his imagina|tion? At the &s;ame time he mu&s;t take care, that all his imaginary additions are founded in nature, or his work will di&s;|gu&s;t. Such al&s;o mu&s;t be the painter's care. But under this re&s;triction, he cer|tainly may bring together a more <HI>con&s;i&s;tent whole,</HI> culled from the <HI>various parts</HI> of nature, than nature her&s;elf exhibits in <HI>any one &s;cene.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 314 <HI>Trace thy lines with pencil free.</HI> The ma&s;ter is di&s;covered even in his chalk, or black-lead lines&mdash;&s;o free, firm, and intelligent.
<PB N="31" REF="141">
We often admire the&s;e fir&s;t, rude touches. The &s;tory of the two old ma&s;ters will be remembred, who left cards of compli|ments to each other, on which only the &s;imple outline of a figure was drawn by one, and corrected by the other; but with &s;uch a &s;uperior elegance in each, that the &s;ignature of names could not have marked them more deci&s;ively.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 318 <HI>Fir&s;t &s;ketch a &s;light cartoon.</HI> It is the practice indeed of the generality of painters, when they have any great de&s;ign to execute, to make a &s;light &s;ketch, &s;ometimes on paper, and &s;ometimes on canvas. And the&s;e &s;ketches are often greatly &s;uperior to the principal picture, which has been laboured, and fini&s;hed with the exacte&s;t care. King William on hor&s;e-back at Hampton court, by &s;ir Godfrey Kneller, is a &s;triking example of this remark. The picture is highly fini&s;hed; but is a tame, and unma&s;terly performance. At Houghton-hall I have &s;een the original &s;ketch of this picture; which I &s;hould have valued, not only greatly beyond the picture it&s;elf, but beyond any thing I ever &s;aw from the pencil of &s;ir Godfrey.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 331 <HI>One truth &s;he gives,</HI> &amp;c. From the&s;e three virgin colours, <HI>red, blue,</HI> and <HI>yellow,</HI> all the tints of nature are compo&s;ed. Greens
<PB N="32" REF="142">
of various hues, are compo&s;ed of blue, and yellow: orange, of red, and yellow: purple and violet, of red, and blue. The tints of the rainbow &s;eem to be compo&s;ed al&s;o of the&s;e colours. They lie in order thus: violet&mdash;<HI>red</HI>&mdash;orange&mdash;<HI>yellow</HI>&mdash;green &mdash;<HI>blue</HI>&mdash;violet&mdash;<HI>red:</HI> in which a&s;&s;ortment we ob&s;erve that orange comes between <HI>red,</HI> and <HI>yellow;</HI> that is, it is compo&s;ed of tho&s;e colours melting into each other. Green is in the &s;ame way compo&s;ed of <HI>yellow</HI> and <HI>blue;</HI> and violet, or purple of <HI>blue,</HI> and <HI>red.</HI>&mdash;Nay even browns of all kinds may, in a degree, be effected by a mixture of the&s;e original colours: &s;o may grey; and even a kind of black, tho not a perfect one.&mdash;As all pigments how|ever are deficient, and cannot approach the rainbow colours, which are the pure&s;t we know, the painter mu&s;t often, even in his &s;plendid tints, call in different reds, blues, and yellows. Thus as vermilion, tho an excellent red on many occa&s;ions, cannot give the ro&s;y, crim&s;on hue, he mu&s;t often call in lake. Nor will he find any yellow, or blue, that will an&s;wer every purpo&s;e. In the tribe of browns he will be &s;till more at a lo&s;s; and mu&s;t have recour&s;e to different earths.&mdash;In oil-painting one of the fine&s;t earths is known,
<PB N="33" REF="143">
at the colour-&s;hops, by the name of <HI>ca&s;tle-earth,</HI> or <HI>Vandyke's-brown;</HI> as it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been u&s;ed by that ma&s;ter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 336 <HI>And is by her rejected.</HI> Scarce any natural object, but &s;now, is purely white. The chalk-cliff is generally in a degree di&s;co|loured. The petals of the &s;now-drop indeed, and of &s;ome other flowers, are purely white: but &s;eldom any of the larger parts of nature.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 358 <HI>Keep in view that harmony,</HI> &amp;c. Tho it will be nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e other colours, be&s;ides <HI>yellow, red,</HI> and <HI>blue,</HI> this union &s;hould however &s;till be kept in view, as the leading principle of harmony. A mix|ture indeed of the&s;e three will produce nearly the colour you want: but the more colours are mixed, the muddier they grow. It will give more clearne&s;s therefore, and brightne&s;s to your colouring, to u&s;e &s;imple pigments, of which there are great abun|dance in the painter's di&s;pen&s;atory.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 361 This mode of colouring is the mo&s;t difficult to attain, as it is the mo&s;t &s;cientific. It includes a perfect knowledge of the effects of colours in all their various agreements, and oppo&s;itions. When attained, it is the mo&s;t ea&s;y in practice. The arti&s;t, who blends his colours on his pallet, depends more on his eye, than on his
<PB N="34" REF="144">
knowledge. He works out his effect by a more laboured proce&s;s; and yet he may produce a good picture in the end.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 380 Nobody was better acquainted with the effects of &s;ky, nor &s;tudied them with more at|tention, than the younger Vanderveldt. Not many years ago, an old Thames-wa|terman was alive, who remembred him well; and had often carried him out in his boat, both up and down the river, to &s;tudy the appearances of the &s;ky. The old man u&s;ed to &s;ay, they went out in all kinds of weather, fair, and foul; and Mr. Vanderveldt took with him large &s;heets of blue paper, which he would mark all over with black, and white. The arti&s;t ea&s;ily &s;ees the intention of this proce&s;s. The&s;e expeditions Vanderveldt called, in his Dutch manner of &s;peaking, <HI>going a &s;koying.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 401 The mo&s;t remarkable in&s;tance of ingenious colouring I ever heard of, is in Guido's St. Michael. The whole picture is com|po&s;ed of blue, red, and black; by means of which colours the ideas of heaven and hell are blended together in a very extra|ordinary manner; and the effect exceed|ingly &s;ublime; while both harmony, and cha&s;tene&s;s are pre&s;erved in the highe&s;t degree.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="35" REF="145">Line 406 <HI>Let &s;hade predominate.</HI> As a <HI>general rule,</HI> the half-tints &s;hould have more extent than the lights; and the &s;hadows &s;hould equal both put together.&mdash;Yet why a predo|minancy of &s;hade &s;hould plea&s;e the eye more than a predominancy of light, would perhaps be difficult to explain. I can ea&s;ily conceive, that a <HI>balance</HI> of light and &s;hade may be founded in &s;ome kind of rea&s;on; but am at a lo&s;s to give a rea&s;on for a predominancy of either. The fact however is undoubted; and we mu&s;t &s;kreen our ignorance of the principle, as well as we can.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 440 This rule re&s;pects an <HI>affected di&s;play of light.</HI> If it be introduced as a focus, &s;o as not to fall <HI>naturally</HI> on the &s;everal objects it touches, it di&s;gu&s;ts. Rembrandt, I doubt, is &s;ometimes chargeable with this fault. He is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be a ma&s;ter of this part of painting; and we often &s;ee very beautiful lights in his pictures, and prints: but as in many of them we &s;ee the rever&s;e, he appears to have had no fixed principle. Indeed, few parts of painting are &s;o much neglected, &s;o ea&s;ily tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, and &s;o little under&s;tood, as the di&s;tribution of light.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 444 <HI>Oppo&s;ition,</HI> and <HI>gradation</HI> are the two grand means of producing effect by light. In
<PB N="36" REF="146">
the picture ju&s;t given (l. 424. &amp;c.) of the evening-ray, the effect is produced by <HI>oppo&s;ition.</HI> Beautiful effects too of the &s;ame kind ari&s;e often from <HI>catching lights.</HI> &mdash;The power of producing effect by <HI>gradation,</HI> is not le&s;s forcible. Indeed, without a degree of <HI>gradation, oppo&s;ition</HI> it&s;elf would be mute. In the picture ju&s;t given of the evening-ray, the grand part of the effect, no doubt, ari&s;es from the <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> between the gloom, and the light: but in part it ari&s;es al&s;o from the <HI>gradation</HI> of the light, till it reach it's point. It ju&s;t tips
<Q><L>The tufted groves; but all it's &s;plendor pours</L>
<L>On yonder ca&s;tled cliff. &mdash;</L></Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 447 The colours of animals often &s;trongly illu&s;trate the idea of <HI>gradation.</HI> When they &s;often into each other, from light to dark, or from one colour into another, the mixture is very picture&s;que. It is as much the rever&s;e, when white and black, or white, and red, are patched over the animal in blotches, without any intermediate tints. Dome&s;tic cattle, cows, dogs, &s;wine, goats, and cats, are often di&s;agreeably patched: tho we &s;ometimes &s;ee them plea&s;ingly coloured with a graduating tint. Wild animals, in general, are more uniformly
<PB N="37" REF="147">
coloured, than tame. Except the zebra, and two or three of the &s;potted race, I recollect none which are not, more or le&s;s, tinted in this graduating manner. The tiger, the panther, and other varie|gated animals have their beauty: but the zebra, I think, is rather a curious, than a picture&s;que animal. It's &s;treaked &s;ides injure it both in point of colour, and in the delineation of it's form.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 467 <HI>But rarely &s;pread it on the di&s;tant &s;cene.</HI> In general perhaps a land&s;cape is be&s;t in|lightened, when the light falls on the middle parts of the picture; and the foreground is in &s;hadow. This throws a kind of natural retiring hue throughout the land&s;cape: and tho the <HI>di&s;tance be in &s;hadow,</HI> yet that &s;hadow is &s;o faint, that the retiring hue is &s;till pre&s;erved. This however is only a general rule. In hi&s;to|ry-painting the light is properly thrown upon the figures on the foreground; which are the <HI>capital part</HI> of the picture. In land&s;cape the middle grounds commonly form <HI>the &s;cene,</HI> or the <HI>capital part;</HI> and the foreground is litttle more, than an appendage. Sometimes however it hap|pens, that a ruin, or &s;ome other capital object on the foreground, makes the <HI>prin|cipal part of the &s;cene.</HI> When that is the
<PB N="38" REF="148">
ca&s;e, it &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed by light; unle&s;s it be &s;o &s;ituated as to receive more di&s;tinction from &s;hade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 482 <HI>A fiercer &s;plendor opens to our view all his terrific features.</HI> It is very amu&s;ing, in mountainous countries, to ob&s;erve the appearance, which the &s;ame mountain often makes under different circum&s;tan|ces. When it is inve&s;ted with light mi&s;ts; or even when it is not illumined, we &s;ee it's whole &s;ummit perhaps under one grey tint. But as it receives the &s;un, e&s;pecially an evening-&s;un, we &s;ee a va|riety of fractures, and cha&s;ms gradually opening, of which we di&s;covered not the lea&s;t appearance before.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 488 Tho the objects may le&s;&s;en in due proportion, which is called <HI>keeping;</HI> tho the gra|duating hue of retiring objects, or the <HI>aerial per&s;pective,</HI> may be ju&s;t; and tho the light may be di&s;tributed according to the rules of art; yet &s;till there may not be that general re&s;ult of harmony, which denotes the picture <HI>one object:</HI> and as the eye may be mi&s;led, when it has the <HI>&s;everal parts</HI> before it, the be&s;t way of examining it as a <HI>perfect whole,</HI> is to examine it in &s;uch a light, as will not admit the inve&s;tigation of <HI>parts.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="39" REF="149">Line 529 <HI>Others,</HI> &amp;c. Some painters copy exactly what they &s;ee. In this there is more mechani|cal preci&s;ion, than genius. Others take a <HI>general, comprehen&s;ive view</HI> of their ob|ject; and marking ju&s;t the <HI>characteri&s;tic points,</HI> lead the &s;pectator, if he be a man of ta&s;te, and genius likewi&s;e, into a truer knowledge of it, than the copier can do, with all his painful exactne&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 563 <HI>Why then degrade,</HI> &amp;c. If by bringing the figures forward on the foreground, you give room for <HI>character,</HI> and <HI>expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> you put them out of place as <HI>appendages,</HI> for which they were intended.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 581 <HI>Oft &s;lowly winding,</HI> &amp;c. The machine it&s;elf here de&s;cribed is picture&s;que: and when it is &s;een in <HI>winding motion,</HI> or (in other words) when half of it is &s;een in per|&s;pective, it receives additional beauty from contra&s;t. In the &s;ame manner a cavalcade, or an army on it's march, may be con&s;idered as <HI>one object;</HI> and derive beauty from the &s;ame &s;ource. Mr. Gray has given us a very picture&s;que view of this kind, in de&s;cribing the march of Edward I;
<Q><L>As down the &s;teep of Snowdon's &s;haggy &s;ide</L>
<L>He wound with toil&s;ome march his long array.</L>

Through a pa&s;&s;age in the mountain we &s;ee the troops winding round at a great di&s;tance. Among tho&s;e nearer the eye, we di&s;tingui&s;h the hor&s;e and foot; and on the foreground, the action, and ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the principal commanders. The ancients &s;eem to have known very little of that &s;ource of the picture&s;que, which ari&s;es from per&s;pective: every thing is in|troduced in front before the eye: and among the early painters we &s;ee very lit|tle more attention paid to it. Raphael is far from making a full u&s;e of the know|ledge of it; and I believe Julio Romano makes &s;till le&s;s. I do not remember meeting any where with a more picture&s;que de&s;cription of a line of march, than in Vaillant's travels into the interior parts of Africa. He was pa&s;&s;ing with a numerous caravan, along the borders of Caffraria. I fir&s;t, &s;ays he, made the people of the hord, which accompanied me, &s;et out with their cat|tle: and a little after my cattle followed; cows, &s;heep, and goats; with all the women of the hord, mounted on oxen with their children. My waggons, with the re&s;t of my people, clo&s;ed the rear. I my&s;elf, mounted on hor&s;eback, rode backwards, and forewards. This caravan
<PB N="41" REF="151">
on it's march, exhibited often a &s;ingu|lar, and amu&s;ing &s;pectacle. The turns it was obliged to make in following the windings of the woods, and rocks, con|tinually gave it new forms. Sometimes it intirely di&s;appeared: then &s;uddenly, at a di&s;tance, from the &s;ummit of a hill, I again di&s;covered my vanguard &s;lowly ad|vancing perhaps towards a di&s;tant moun|tain: while the main body, following the track, were ju&s;t below me.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 595 This rule indeed applies to all other objects: but as the &s;hip is &s;o large a machine, and at the &s;ame time &s;o complicated a one, it's <HI>character</HI> is le&s;s obvious, than that of mo&s;t other objects. It is much better therefore, where a ve&s;&s;el is nece&s;|&s;ary, to put in a few touches for a &s;kiff; than to in&s;ert &s;ome di&s;agreeable form for a &s;hip, to which it has no Re&s;emblance. At the &s;ame time, it is not at all nece&s;|&s;ary to make your &s;hip &s;o accurate, that a &s;eaman could find no fault with it. It is the &s;ame in figures: as appendages of land&s;cape there is no nece&s;&s;ity to have them exactly accurate; but if they have not the <HI>general form,</HI> and <HI>character</HI> of what they repre&s;ent, the land&s;cape is better without them.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="42" REF="152">Line 603 <HI>They &s;eem,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Rapid motion</HI> alone, and that <HI>near the eye,</HI> is here cen&s;ured. We &s;hould be careful not to narrow too much the circum&s;cribed &s;phere of art. There is an art of &s;eeing, as well as of painting. The eye mu&s;t in part enter into the deception. The art of painting mu&s;t, in &s;ome degree, be con&s;idered as an act of convention. General forms only are imi|tated, and much is to be &s;upplied by the imagination of the &s;pectator.&mdash;It is thus in drama. How ab&s;urdly would the &s;pectator act, if in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the illu&s;ion of the &s;tage, he &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on being deceived, without being a party in the deception?&mdash;if he refu&s;ed to believe, that the light he &s;aw, was the &s;un; or the &s;cene before him, the Roman ca|pital, becau&s;e he knew the one was a candle-light, and the other, a painted cloth?

<ITEM>Line 636 Guido's air, no doubt, is often very plea&s;ing. He is thought to have excelled in ima|gining the angelic character; and, as if aware of this &s;uperiority, was fond of painting angels. After all, however, they, who&s;e ta&s;te is formed on the &s;implicity

of the antique, think <HI>Guido's air,</HI> in ge|neral &s;omewhat theatrical.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 638 <HI>Skilful they,</HI> &amp;c. The greate&s;t ob&s;truction to the progre&s;s of art ari&s;es from the pre|judices of conceited judges; who, in fact, know le&s;s about the matter, than they, who know nothing: ina&s;much as truth is le&s;s obvious to error, than it is to ignorance. Till they can be prevailed on to return upon their &s;teps, and look for that criterion in nature, which they &s;eek in the half-peri&s;hed works of great names; the painter will be di&s;couraged from pur&s;uing knowledge in tho&s;e paths, where Raphael, and Titian found it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Line 639 <HI>What if the&s;e compare,</HI> &amp;c. Bruyere ob&s;erves, that the inferior critic judges only by <HI>compari&s;on.</HI> In one &s;en&s;e all judgment mu&s;t be formed on compari&s;on. But Bruyere, who is &s;peaking of poetry means, that the inferior critic has no &s;cale of judging of a work of art, but by comparing it with &s;ome other work of the &s;ame kind. He judges of Virgil by a compari&s;on with Homer; and of Spencer by comparing him with Ta&s;&s;o. By &s;uch critici&s;m he may indeed arrive at certain truths; but he will never form that ma&s;terly judgment, which he might do by comparing the work before him
<PB N="44" REF="154">
with the great archetypes of nature, and the &s;olid rules of his art.&mdash;What Bruyere &s;ays of the critic in poetry, is very applicable to the critic in painting. The inferior critic, who has travelled, and &s;een the works of many great ma&s;ters, &s;uppo&s;es he has trea&s;ured up from them the ideas of perfection; and in&s;tead of judging of a picture by the rules of painting, and it's agreement with nature, he judges of it by the arbitrary ideas he has conceived; and the&s;e too very pro|bably much injured in the conception. From this comparative mode of criti|cizing, the art receives no advancement. All we gain, is, that one arti&s;t paints better than another.</ITEM>
