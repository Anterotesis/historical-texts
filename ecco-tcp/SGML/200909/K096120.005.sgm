<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE TUNGUSIANS, &amp;c. From STELLER, KRATSCHENINIKAFF, MULLER, COOKE, and Others.</HEAD>
<P>DR. PALLAS not having travelled &s;o far north in Siberia, as to explore the countries of the Tungu&s;ians, Youkaguirians, T&s;chouckt&s;ches, Koraiks, Kurilians, Kamt&s;chadales, and the Ea&s;tern i&s;landers, which are al&s;o parts of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire; I will &s;up|ply the deficiency from <HI>Steller, Muller, Cooke,</HI> and others, who have treated upon the &s;ubject. <HI>Steller, Muller,</HI> and <HI>Krat&s;cheninikaff,</HI> have furni&s;hed us with the be&s;t accounts we have at pre&s;ent; but other travel|lers, though not literary men, have given &s;ome ac|counts, equally true and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">Of the different nations which occupy this country, the Youkaguirians are &s;imilar, in language and manners, to the Jakutes; the T&s;choukt&s;ches re&s;emble the peo|ple of the northern i&s;les; the Kurilians, and the people of Kam&s;chatka, are like tho&s;e of the Ea&s;tern i&s;lands; and the Koraiks, re&s;emble the T&s;choukt&s;ches, and Kamt&s;chadales. But as much as any of the&s;e parti|cipate in language, and way of living, there is &s;till a characteri&s;tic difference. We will &s;peak fir&s;t of the Tungu&s;ians.</P>
<P><HI>Tungus,</HI> in Tartar, implies a hog; and the Tartars probably gave them this name, by way of contempt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and to expre&s;s their natural filthine&s;s. Their de&s;arts extend, ea&s;tward, from the Jeni&s;ei, beyond the Lena, as far as the Amur, and the ea&s;tern &s;ea. From &s;outh to north, they inhabit the country, from the 53d degree of north latitude, to the 65th. As they are a peace|able people, they admit various, other nations to live among them, particularly the Ea&s;tjaiks, Samojedes and Jakutes. Some of this tribe belong to the Chine&s;e, and wander about the river Amur, and the di&s;trict of the Mand&s;hours. Their country, in general, is mar&s;hy, and inter&s;per&s;ed with mountains and fore&s;ts, except about the Amur; and the climate is &s;o cold, that they can clear the land but in very few places.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;tjaiks of the Jeni&s;ei, gave the Ru&s;&s;ians no|tice of the&s;e people, in 1607. Many expeditions were
<PB N="5" REF="5">
&s;ent again&s;t them; but they were not wholly &s;ubdued, till 1657.</P>
<P>The Tungu&s;e, like all other ea&s;tern nations, divide them&s;elves into races; each race compo&s;ed of &s;everal di&s;tingui&s;hed families, known by the name of their founders. Tho&s;e who can prove their origin, in a direct line from the founder of the family, are e&s;teemed noble, and called <HI>Oterikan.</HI> From the&s;e nobles, they elect their &s;ai&s;sans, or chiefs, who are confirmed by the go|vernment of Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>In 1766, they were numbered in order to be taxed; and were found to con&s;i&s;t of 117 races, which all together compri&s;ed 29,647 boys, or males, that paid tribute, be|&s;ides, about 1,700 tents, or families, that roamed beyond their own de&s;arts, into neighbouring territories; and there are al&s;o many yet unrolled; of cour&s;e, we may &s;ay, that the Tungu&s;ians form one of the mo&s;t numerous nations of Siberia: for if we add three to each family, for their wives and children, it makes up the number of tho&s;e regi&s;tered only, near one hundred and twenty thou&s;and people.</P>
<P>The Tungu&s;e are of a middling &s;tature, and well-made; their faces not &s;o flat as the Kalmucks: they have a fre&s;h complexion; &s;mall, &s;harp eyes; &s;mall, thin no&s;e; lank, black hair, and very little beard; &s;ome men have none at all. Their &s;en&s;es of &s;eeing and hear|ing,
<PB N="6" REF="6">
are &s;o acute, as to be wonderful; but their organs of feeling and &s;melling, are le&s;s acute than ours; and their voice is rather hoar&s;e. Their young women are well-made, plea&s;ing figures, very &s;prightly and mode&s;t; but their old women are frightfully ugly, full of wrinkles, &s;moke and filth, with eyes as red as fire. We &s;eldom &s;ee a white-headed man or woman, even in the mo&s;t advanced, old age; they are vigorous, &s;traight and upright, and &s;o full of vivacity, that a &s;tranger would not &s;uppo&s;e them old.</P>
<P>In con&s;titution they are &s;anguine, and in temper frank; always appearing as they are. Lying is, to them, &s;o ab&s;urd a thing, that they are never guilty of it; of cour&s;e, they are never &s;u&s;picious, nor are they obliged to affirm any thing upon oath. Theft and fraud are held &s;o very infamous among them, that on the &s;malle&s;t reflection, or reproach, of that kind, a chal|lenge en&s;ues, and they immediately proceed to fight, with bows and arrows. Content with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, they want no other, keeping to the manners and cu&s;toms of their ance&s;tors, and never forming any no|vel &s;cheme. Not anxious for the morrow, they chear|fully divide the la&s;t mor&s;el with the fir&s;t comer; and the gaiety of conver&s;ation, is never lo&s;t in the poverty of the ho&s;t. Though they are often obliged to fa&s;t many days without food, they are never di&s;pirited. The only ca&s;e in which they look forward, is in mar|riage; and in this they are &s;o prudent, as &s;eldom to be
<PB N="7" REF="7">
unhappy; for, added to the provi&s;ion they make, they are &s;o indifferent to the world, that they are neither nice or delicate in love-matters; nor are they inclined to libertini&s;m. Within their &s;phere of knowledge, they are attentive, diligent, and of good capacity; learning foreign languages with care and expedition; and almo&s;t acquainted with every tree and &s;tone within the tracts they are accu&s;tomed to. They are good hor&s;e|men, good hunters, and dextrous at the bow. They will track their game, by the pre&s;&s;ure of the gra&s;s, or mo&s;s, and even by marks on the ground, though &s;o light as not to be di&s;covered by others. They are re|&s;olute, and daring, to a great degree; great numbers fall in duels; and they will, unarmed, attack a bear, if they meet one; yet, re&s;olute as they are, they cannot calmly &s;uffer extreme indigence, wounds, lo&s;s of friends or fortune. But with all this, &s;ociety has no charms with them; they go &s;ingly to hunt, and when they chance to meet in the va&s;t de&s;arts, they feel no &s;ocial plea&s;ure; and, when relations part, they do it without regret. The rich, as in every other country, have a greater number of wants and cares, than tho&s;e who are poorer, and are le&s;s liberal and generous; however, the wealthy are all ready to pay tribute, for &s;uch as are old and infirm; and this is done in &s;kins, or furs.</P>
<P>Their language is a dialect of the Mand&s;hourian, ea&s;y to pronounce, and not unplea&s;ing to the ear. It con|tains but few letters, and is written in characters ea&s;ier
<PB N="8" REF="8">
drawn than penned; but the Ru&s;&s;ian Tungu&s;e have neither &s;chools, nor books; their learning being con|fined merely to tradition. In a ca&s;e of di&s;pute, they will rather &s;ubmit it to arbitration, or fight it out with arrows, than refer it to a magi&s;trate, or <HI>Darouga,</HI> and be judged by laws they are unacquainted with. Duel|ling is forbidden; for which rea&s;on numbers di&s;appear, without any one being able to tell what is become of them. As a proof of their good order, there is not a &s;ingle Tungu&s;ian, among the criminals, employed in the mines of Nert&s;chint&s;koi.</P>
<P>When <HI>Valdeyak,</HI> or man-&s;laughter, is the con&s;equence of a quarrel, it is not a capital offence; the killer is, however, flogged on the back with &s;ticks, and obliged to maintain the family of the per&s;on killed; yet he is never reproached, but con&s;idered as the braver for it. A certain number of &s;trokes is the puni&s;hment of theft, and an obligation to re&s;tore the thing &s;tolen, or its value, and the thief is ignominious for the re&s;t of his life. For rape, or &s;eduction, the men only are puni&s;hed. The gallant is forced to purcha&s;e his fair one, at a certain &s;um, or be flogged. If a man, in poor circum&s;tances, deflowers a girl, either rich or hand&s;ome, the relations will often privily &s;hoot him, and put him to death. Married people are allowed to decide their dome&s;tic quarrels by fighting; but if either is wounded, the per&s;on giving the wound is whipped. If a married couple find they cannot live happily
<PB N="9" REF="9">
together, they &s;eparate. Tungu&s;ian women are not more exact in conjugal fidelity than the men; of cour&s;e, gallantries and intrigues pa&s;s often unnoticed.</P>
<P>All accidental marks, and defects of the covered part of the body, and a redundancy of hair, are attri|buted to the influence of devils; and though either is &s;eldom the lot of a Tungu&s;e girl, yet, where it hap|pens, it is the cau&s;e of irony, and there are examiners into the&s;e defects, who pronounce a &s;entence of di|vorce accordingly.</P>
<P>In matters of litigation, which is not often, oaths are enjoined, of which there are three kinds. In one, the accu&s;ed per&s;on takes a knife in his hand, brandi&s;hes it towards the &s;un, and pronounces the&s;e words: <Q>If I am guilty, may the &s;un &s;end di&s;ea&s;e into my body, as mortal as a &s;tab of this knife would be!</Q> In an|other, the criminal is forced to climb up a &s;acred mountain, repeating, as he mounts, <Q>May I die, if I am guilty; or, may I lo&s;e my children and my cat|tle; or, I renounce for ever, all &s;ucce&s;s in hunting and fi&s;hing, if I am guilty!</Q> But the &s;tricte&s;t oath, is, when the accu&s;ed is made to drink &s;ome blood of a dog, who&s;e throat they have cut, and impaled near a fire, and burnt; the per&s;on taking the oath, &s;catters pieces of his fle&s;h about, &s;aying: <Q>What I &s;ay, is as true as that I drink this blood; if I lye, may I peri&s;h, burn, or be dried up, like this dog!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">The Tungu&s;e live by pa&s;turage, hunting and fi&s;hing; the rein-deer furni&s;hes them, as it does the Lapland|ers, with every nece&s;&s;ary of life. The opulent have flocks, 1000, or more, in number; the poor, about 20. Such being their manner of life, they &s;eldom remain in the &s;ame place, longer than three days, wandering in large bodies; and when they traver&s;e their immea|&s;urable wilds, they &s;eparate &s;o much from each other, that one would &s;uppo&s;e, they were di&s;tinct families. Independent of their flocks, their wealth is but &s;mall; con&s;i&s;ting only of their cloaths, huts, dogs, and in&s;tru|ments for hunting and fi&s;hing; and all the&s;e are not worth five rubles. Their poverty, however, gives them no concern; for, having but few wants, they have fewer cares.</P>
<P>Every race has a certain di&s;trict to fi&s;h in, called, a <HI>Boa.</HI> Their boats are a kind of wherries <HI>(Yaou),</HI> made of very light wood, covered with birch, &s;ewed toge|ther. They are flat at bottom, brought to a point at each end, and are of various lengths. Their breadth is from one foot and an half to two feet and an half; and though they are &s;trong enough to carry four or five men, &s;ome will weigh no more than 30lb. the large&s;t not above 50lb. In the&s;e tickli&s;h ve&s;&s;els, they will cro&s;s the mo&s;t rapid rivers, and venture out, at a great di&s;tance, from &s;hore, on the Baikal, with one oar only, made with a kind of &s;hovel at each end, with which they &s;trike the water alternately. They fi&s;h with a
<PB REF="11">

<PB N="11" REF="12">
three-hooked prong; the prongs three inches long, and one inch apart; this is fa&s;tened to one end of a line, &s;even feet long, the other end fixed to the boat. The following is their manner of fi&s;hing: they row about in the night to the &s;teep, &s;andy &s;teps of the &s;hore, and having &s;et fire to &s;ome deal chips, lie down on their faces, to watch the fi&s;h; and they are &s;o expert at this bu&s;ine&s;s, that a fi&s;h, once &s;een, &s;eldom e&s;capes the hook (See the Plate).</P>
<P>Their methods of hunting, and catching animals, are &s;o various, and the number of gins, &s;nares, and &s;elf-&s;hooting bows, &s;o great, that it is dangerous to travel in the&s;e parts, without a Tungu&s;ian guide, acquainted with the marks where &s;nares are laid. As the&s;e people commonly hunt alone, they are expo&s;ed to various ac|cidents, and often lo&s;e their lives by a fall from &s;ome cliff, or by heavy &s;tones, from the mountains, rolling down on them. Some are carried away in cro&s;&s;ing rivers, in the rapidity of the &s;tream, and others torn to pieces by wild bea&s;ts. Should an unfortunate &s;port&s;|man chance to break a limb, and fall down between two rocks, &s;o that he cannot di&s;engage him&s;elf, he lin|gers, till Death, by hunger, relieves him, with but one hope, that of a wild bea&s;t's putting a &s;peedier end to his &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>None of the Tungu&s;e occupy them&s;elves in any han|dicraft work: a black&s;mith is the only exception; and
<PB N="12" REF="13">
his bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on in &s;o &s;mall a &s;cale, that he can carry all his materials in a bag under his arm. Their women are employed in dome&s;tic offices; in making of cloaths, dying, tanning, and drying of fi&s;h. They are expert, al&s;o, at dre&s;&s;ing furs, and making &s;hammoy leather; but their great excellence is, in &s;taining white furs, and embroidering their cloaths with goat's hair, and thread; made of the nerves of animals.</P>
<P>Their arans, or huts, are made of 20 poles, about 14 feet high, formed into a cone, joined at top by hooks, and &s;preading over a &s;pace, at bottom, from 14 to 17 feet in diameter. The in&s;ide is hung with birch-bark, boiled, and &s;ewed together, like linen, and fringed within, with &s;lips of the &s;ame bark. The fire-place is in the middle, and the &s;moke i&s;&s;ues out at top. They leave a &s;pace on one &s;ide, to enter, and cover it with a birch-bark curtain; &s;o that their jurts, or huts, re&s;emble a &s;oldier's tent. In winter, they remove their tents, under &s;ome hill, for &s;helter; but, in &s;ummer, they are erected near the water-edge.</P>
<P>Their furniture con&s;i&s;ts only of a &s;mall, iron kettle, wooden, or bark ve&s;&s;els, leathern bottles, a cradle, a pair of &s;now-&s;cates, a &s;ledge, drawn by dogs of the Pomeranian breed, boxes, covered with &s;kins and em|broidered, &s;pades to dig up roots, about one foot and a half long, a little bent, and pointed with iron, and a few implements for hunting and fi&s;hing. Their omko,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
or cradles, are boxes about 18 inches deep, made of birch-bark, and lined with &s;kins, without a cover. At one end, the bottom and &s;ides form an obtu&s;e angle, &s;omewhat like an armed chair, in which the child is &s;upported by a back-board, through which a hole is made to prevent it from hurting its head; and a &s;mall idol is hung over the child's head, as a tutelary ge|nius. Every cradle has a leather &s;trap, by which it hangs at the mother's back, is hung to the &s;addle of a hor&s;e, or &s;u&s;pended in the tent or on &s;ome tree.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the Tungu&s;e is much like that of the Jakutes, but very different from that of mo&s;t other ea&s;tern nations, which, according to Mr. <HI>Fi&s;cher,</HI> Pro|fe&s;&s;or of the Academy of Sciences at Peter&s;burg, who was among that people &s;ome time, con&s;i&s;ts of a fur-habit, which they wear next the &s;kin, &s;hort trow&s;ers, and long &s;tockings, or boots, for they an&s;wer both pur|po&s;es, drawn up tight and &s;mooth to the leg, and fa&s;ten|ened to the trow&s;ers. The&s;e &s;tockings are &s;oled and em|broidered, ornamented with gla&s;s beads, and fringed. They fa&s;ten their breeches with a &s;tring, which runs through the wai&s;tband, to which is tied, in part, a &s;mall leather apron, cut into a great many &s;lips, like fringe. The coat-&s;leeves are clo&s;e, the &s;kirts reach no lower than the knees, the borders are edged with fur, and the collars are embroidered, two inches broad, and fringed with a white hair, about four inches deep. Sometimes, the &s;eams are covered with gla&s;s beads, &s;triped with
<PB N="14" REF="15">
blue and white paint. They wear no girdle, but fa&s;ten their pipes and tobacco-pouch, flint, &s;teel and knife, to the wai&s;tband of their trow&s;ers. Under their coat they wear a wai&s;tcoat, that does not clo&s;e en|tirely on the brea&s;t, but fa&s;tens with thongs: and, to defend their bo&s;oms from the cold, they wear, in win|ter, a kind of brea&s;t-plate, neatly ornamented with gla&s;s beads, and covered with long dyed hair, or goat's &s;kin, four inches broad, and &s;even or eight long. This hangs round the neck, and reaches to the &s;tomach. Some wear, over this brea&s;t-plate, in hopes of good fortune, an iron idol, repre&s;enting a human figure, or that of a bea&s;t, or bird. In winter, they wear, over over the&s;e, &s;tockings, or boots, bu&s;kins that reach half way the leg, made of white rein-deer &s;kin. To give them a &s;avage appearance, they trim their cloaths with fur; and many fix large tufts of black, white, or red hair, 15 or 16 inches long, at their hips, and delight in &s;eeing them float in the air. In &s;ummer, they go bare-headed; but, in winter, wear a cap made of the &s;kin of the head of &s;ome horned animal, a rein-deer, goat, &amp;c. and &s;o contrive it, that the ears and horns of the animal being left on, are &s;et erect on the head. They tie their hair clo&s;e behind, and let it hang down loo&s;e on the back; and where they tie their hair, they have a bunch of beads (The women dre&s;s exactly like the men). Many of the men mark their faces with blue dots, in irregular figures; as do the Americans, and Greenlanders. This ornament is e&s;teemed a beauty;
<PB N="15" REF="16">
and mothers imprint them on their children, by draw|ing a thread, blacked with &s;oot and &s;pittle, under the <HI>epidermis,</HI> which at fir&s;t inflames the part, but leaves an indelible, blue mark. In &s;ummer, as a protection from the flies, they hang a bunch of hor&s;e-hair over their &s;houlders; and every one carries the &s;oft, &s;hining &s;kin, taken from a drake's head, with which they wipe the &s;mall flies from their eyes. (See Pl. p. 125, Vol. 4.)</P>
<P>The youth, of both &s;exes, when well dre&s;&s;ed, make a hand&s;ome appearance; and their ea&s;y carriage and manners, and open and chearful countenance, add not a little to their figure. Such of this people as lead a &s;hepherd-life, dre&s;s &s;till better, and &s;have their heads, as do the Mongols, leaving a lock of hair on the crown, which they braid into a tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Tungu&s;e are not delicate in their eating. All kinds of animals, even carnivorous ones, dead car|ca&s;es, if not too much putrified, wea&s;els, mice, all come alike to them; and they &s;earch for and eat, a variety of bulbous roots, as onions, lilies, and &s;uch roots as are &s;tored up by the mice of this country. They make provi&s;ion, for the winter, of fi&s;h frozen, dried or &s;moked, and fle&s;h, prepared in a &s;imilar manner; and &s;tow it away in pits, dug under ground, or &s;mall huts, like pigeon-hou&s;es, built on the top of the &s;tump of a tree, 13 or 14 feet from the ground, as do the Lap|landers, that it may be out of the reach of wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">They do not eat raw meat, like the Samojedes; but they boil it in water, without &s;alt; or roa&s;t it, on a wooden &s;pit. They have a di&s;h, called <HI>Sillo,</HI> made of fle&s;h and wild roots; a kind of blood-pudding, called <HI>Schiloukta,</HI> made in the gut of an animal, without cleaning it; and as to fat and &s;uet, they will eat it un|dre&s;&s;ed, as it comes from the animal it&s;elf. But the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tful of all their viands, are, the <HI>Silama,</HI> and <HI>Oed&eacute;gal:</HI> the&s;e are the after-births of women; which, when roa&s;ted, is called <HI>Silama,</HI> when boiled, <HI>Oed&eacute;gal.</HI> This is a delicacy re&s;erved for the father: the woman, her&s;elf, ta&s;tes of it; but none are invited to partake of it, but their be&s;t friend. Water is their common drink; but, in &s;pring, they drink the &s;ap of birch-trees, or infu&s;ions of certain herbs, ro&s;e-leaves, and goo&s;eberry-leaves. In &s;ummer, they chew <HI>Niouta,</HI> which is the gum of the larch, in order to keep their mouth moi&s;t; and &s;ometimes they chew and &s;moke tobacco, but never to intoxication. They, like other Tartars, di&s;till a &s;pirit from &s;our milk; but never drink it in &s;uch quan|tities as to inebriate; for their life is a &s;tate of &s;obriety.</P>
<P>They are not great tatlers; but the little they &s;ay, is hone&s;t, and &s;poken from the heart. They are al|ways chearful and contented, and not ea&s;ily provoked. If any one per&s;on is in want of any thing, and another has it, he a&s;ks for it without re&s;erve; and where the per&s;on a&s;ked, has it to give, it is never refu&s;ed; of
<PB N="17" REF="18">
cour&s;e, a refu&s;al gives no offence. They cannot boa&s;t of refinement, or delicacy of &s;entiment; but they are warm in their attachments. When young folks meet, after years of ab&s;ence, it is without emotion; and, when friends part, perhaps never to meet again, it is appa|rently without regret. But it is otherwi&s;e, with per|&s;ons advanced in life; they will, if meeting a friend after a long ab&s;ence, fly into his arms with &s;uch tran&s;|port, as to change colour, and be black in the face; and, in this exta&s;y, will &s;ometimes ki&s;s. The women, however, have more &s;en&s;ibility than the men; they are mi&s;erable at the death of their hu&s;bands; and it is &s;ome|times with difficulty that a young widow is prevented from de&s;troying her&s;elf. Their fondling terms are, <HI>Niki, Outa, Amenikan, Omimikan, Kattoun;</HI> in Engli&s;h, friend, child, little papa, little mama, good old man. Terms of anger are, <HI>Bouni,</HI> and <HI>T&s;schilkour;</HI> that is, thief, and devil.</P>
<P>They can fa&s;t for a long time, a day or two toge|ther; but when they do eat, will do it voraciou&s;ly. They have, however, no fixed hours for meals; but take their food, when they are hungry, &s;quatting on the ground.</P>
<P>Cleanline&s;s is not one of their virtues. They clean each other's head, and &s;wallow the vermin; and parents clean their children's no&s;es, by &s;ucking them. They never wa&s;h them&s;elves, nor clean their di&s;hes. If even
<PB N="18" REF="19">
they wipe them, it is with the fir&s;t piece of fir that comes to hand. It is natural to conceive, that people, in &s;uch a &s;tate of nature, will not be very nice with re&s;pect to decency. Children often go about naked; even adults, of both &s;exes, will &s;it round a fire, naked, all but their trow&s;ers, and will often go abroad &s;o; but marriageable girls are &s;eldom &s;een without &s;ome covering. Wrong as this may appear to be, to a civilized people, cu&s;tom renders it innocent; and, as every adult is married, the con&s;equences are not &s;o bad, as might otherwi&s;e be expected.</P>
<P>Polygamy is allowed among them; &s;ome having five wives, but the generality have but one. Being eager to be their own ma&s;ter, boys marry at 15, and girls before 12. They purcha&s;e their wives, and the price is from 20 to 200 head of cattle; and the bride, as a dowry, brings with her a fourth of the value of the price given for her. When the marriage-contract is made, they cohabit without ceremony; and, on going into their new hou&s;e, make an entertainment for their friends. Their diver&s;ions, on this occa&s;ion, con&s;i&s;t in &s;inging ditties, and relating &s;trange adventures. They have both love-&s;ongs, and &s;ongs of the chace; and they dance, to the &s;ound of the <HI>Kour,</HI> a kind of violin made of a board, and three &s;trings. The men amu&s;e them&s;elves with running races, activity on hor&s;eback, and &s;hooting at a mark.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">The life of the&s;e nomades, is perfectly natural, tem|perate, and independent; de&s;pi&s;ing all luxury, ta&s;te, and refinement. Money they have none; but a little coined iron. Their happine&s;s is confined to good health, a number of children, and living to an advanced old age. Few Tungu&s;ian women, however, have &s;eldom more than four children; owing, probably, to their laborious manner of living, and &s;uckling their children, till they are four years of age. They bring forth with ea&s;e, and, in a few days after, return to their employ; but are not reckoned pure, till after four weeks. The general names of boys are, <HI>Sch&eacute;minga Ourkoundou Lawinka Atounga;</HI> tho&s;e of girls, <HI>Alan|mour, Oyok, Jounguilbi:</HI> and the&s;e names are given, by friends, without any ceremony.</P>
<P>De&s;irous as they are of living to a good old age, they &s;eldom pa&s;s &s;eventy. Sore and inflamed eyes, from their &s;moky huts, are the attendant of old age; but they are free from other di&s;orders, except that of the &s;curvy. The &s;mall-pox has appeared among them, and committed great ravage; but this is &s;eldom. Their prie&s;ts are their phy&s;icians; and their cures, &s;imples, &s;acrifice, and magic. Of their witches, I have &s;poken before.</P>
<P>On the &s;pot where a man dies, there is he buried, except he has expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to the contrary; and the

body is interred, dre&s;&s;ed in his u&s;ual cloaths, with &s;ome tobacco-pipes, and &s;undry uten&s;ils, arms, &amp;c. but prie&s;ts, and &s;ome others, de&s;ire not to be buried at all, but expo&s;ed to the air. In this ca&s;e, they are covered in the coffin, with &s;tones and boughs, and are hung up near the place, where the body of &s;ome &s;chaman has been placed, being all of that &s;ect. After the inter|ment, each one brings provi&s;ion, and drink, to the de|cea&s;ed, and places it on the grave; and this rite, they call, <HI>Schitourap.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF KAMTSCHATKA, From BHERING, PAWLOUTZKY, STELLER, KRATSCHENINIKAFF, KING, and Others.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Country, Climate, Productions, and Animals.</HEAD>
<P>KAMTSCHATKA is a penin&s;ula, formed by a chain of rocky and barren mountains, running to the &s;outh &s;outh-we&s;t of that part of the continent of Si|beria, inhabited by the Koraiks: is bounded by the Ea&s;tern ocean, the gulph of Pen&s;chin&s;koi, and the &s;ea of Oghotzk, between 52 and 61 degrees of north la|titude, and extending to the 174th degree of longitude. The &s;oil is &s;tony, &s;o de&s;titute of the &s;malle&s;t piece of fertile land, and &s;o cold, even in &s;ummer-time, that it will not of it&s;elf produce feed for cattle; nor is it fit
<PB N="23" REF="24">
for cultivation. To an European it would be deemed uninhabitable; yet it is the place to which Ru&s;&s;ia tran&s;|ports its greate&s;t criminals.</P>
<P>In 1690, the Ru&s;&s;ians fir&s;t heard there was &s;uch a place; &s;ix years afterwards, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. In 1727, an expedition to this place was undertaken by <HI>Bhering,</HI> but not completed till 1741. Major <HI>Paw|lout&s;ky,</HI> at the head of a detachment, traver&s;ed great part of this country, and conquered it in 1738; &s;ince which time it has been vi&s;ited by others.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Steller,</HI> who re&s;ided &s;ome time in this country, and &s;eems to have taken great pains to gain information on this &s;ubject, is per&s;uaded, that the true Kamt&s;cha|dales are a people of great antiquity, and have, for many ages, inhabited this penin&s;ula; and that they are originally de&s;cended from the Mongols; for they have no tradition of having migrated from any other coun|try, they believing them&s;elves created, and placed on this very &s;pot, by their god Koutkou; that they are the mo&s;t favoured of all his creatures, the mo&s;t for|tunate of beings; and that their country is &s;uperior to all others, affording means of gratification, far beyond what are any where el&s;e to be met with.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians have a few &s;ettlements in this penin&s;ula, which they call O&s;trogs. The&s;e are no other than a building, &s;urrounded by a palli&s;ado, but &s;ufficient to
<PB N="24" REF="25">
protect their trade, and guard the bani&s;hed criminals. To the&s;e places they are obliged to &s;end the nece&s;&s;aries of life, from great di&s;tances, by hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Kamt&s;chatka is plentifully furni&s;hed with rivers; but none are navigable, except one; and this will carry ve&s;&s;els 150 miles up from its mouth.</P>
<P>The natural &s;everity of the climate, mu&s;t be in due proportion to the general &s;terility of the &s;oil; of which it is probably the cau&s;e. In May, 1779, the whole face of it was covered with &s;now, from &s;ix to eight feet deep. On the 6th, Captain <HI>King</HI> &s;ays, it &s;nowed, with the wind at north-ea&s;t; on the 8th of May, at noon, the thermometer &s;tood at 32&deg;; on the 12th, the &s;now melted; and, in the beginning of June, the low lands were clear. On the 15th of June, the thermometer had never ri&s;en higher than 58&deg;; nor the barometer than 30&deg; 4&prime;. In Augu&s;t, all &s;orts of vegetation &s;eemed to be in its be&s;t &s;tate of perfection. In September, the weather is changeable, but not &s;evere; the greate&s;t height of the thermometer was 65&deg;, the lowe&s;t, 40&deg;; the barometer's greate&s;t height, 30&deg;; its lowe&s;t, 29&deg; 3&prime; In the beginning of October, the tops of the hills begin to be covered again with &s;now. Their &s;ummer, then, ought to be con&s;idered from the middle of June to the middle of September. October may be con&s;idered as an autumnal month; and, from thence to the end of May, winter: no &s;pring.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">Thunder and lightening is here not very common; but their winter is very &s;evere, and they have often dreadful hurricanes of wind and &s;now. Major <HI>Bekm,</HI> who was the Ru&s;&s;ian governor of Kamt&s;chatka, in 1779, &s;ays, That the winter of that year was &s;o cold and inclement, that all intercour&s;e between the inha|bitants was entirely &s;topped; every one being afraid to &s;tir out, even from one hou&s;e to another, for fear of being fro&s;t-bitten. This extreme cold, in &s;o low a la|titude, can only be accounted for, from its being &s;ituated to the ea&s;t of &s;uch an immen&s;e uncultivated tract of country; and from the prevalence of the we&s;t|erly winds, blowing over &s;o exten&s;ive and cold a con|tinent. The extraordinary violence, and impetuo&s;ity of the winds, is attributed to the &s;ubterraneous fires, the &s;ulphureous exhalations, and the general volcanic di&s;po&s;ition of the country.</P>
<P>This penin&s;ula abounds in volcanoes; three of which have, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, been &s;ubject to eruptions. One of the&s;e, in the beginning of 1739, vomited forth, from its &s;ummit, &s;uch a whirlwind of flames, as to re|duce the neighbouring fore&s;ts to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>Their country is &s;aid to contain numerous &s;prings of hot water. <HI>Krat&s;cheninikaff</HI> &s;ays, There are very extra-ordinary pits, or wells, at the bottom of which the water is &s;een to boil, as in a cauldron, with prodigious force and impetuo&s;ity; at the &s;ame time, a dreadful
<PB N="26" REF="27">
noi&s;e i&s;&s;ues out of them, and &s;o thick a vapour, that a man cannot be &s;een through it.</P>
<P>On the banks of their navigable rivers, &s;ays the &s;ame author, is found plenty of roots and berries, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;upply the want of corn. Near the head of this river, corn would grow, as well as in other places of the &s;ame latitude. Several trials of &s;ummer-corn have been made, in which both barley and oats have &s;ucceeded. Vegetables have al&s;o been tried; but the mo&s;t &s;ucculent plants, produce only leaves and &s;talks. Cabbages and lettuce never come to per|fection; and peas will bloom till late in harve&s;t, and not bear. Turneps and radi&s;hes thrive well; and the gra&s;s, e&s;pecially near the rivers and lakes, runs up near &s;ix feet high, and grows &s;o fa&s;t, that it is &s;ometimes cut three times in a &s;ummer. Cattle, in &s;uch places, are, therefore, large and fat, and give plenty of milk all the year. Places, where the gra&s;s grows, are not &s;o much covered with &s;now, as the bogs and &s;wamps. There is plenty of wood in this country, fit for build|ing hou&s;es and &s;hipping. Mr. <HI>King,</HI> who was there in May, 1779, &s;ays, he travelled over the &s;now, to a well-wooded f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at, where the &s;now was thawed, but the trees were ju&s;t budding, and the verdure of the whole &s;cene was &s;trongly contra&s;ted with the &s;ides of the &s;urround|ing hills, &s;till covered with &s;now; that the &s;oil appeared capable of producing all common vegetables, and ye he did not &s;ee the &s;malle&s;t &s;pot cultivated, nor were
<PB N="27" REF="28">
any of the inhabitants po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any kind of cattle. Yet, in another place, he &s;ays. If I may judge of the &s;oil, by what I &s;aw of its vegetation, I &s;hould not he&s;itate in pronouncing it barren in the extreme. Neither in the bay, nor in the country I traver&s;ed, nor in any of our hunting expeditions, did I ever meet with the &s;malle&s;t &s;pot of ground, that re&s;embled what is called, in England, a good green turf, or that &s;eemed as if it could be turned to any advantage, either in the way of pa&s;turage, or other mode of cultivation. The face of the country, in general, was covered with &s;tunted trees, having a bottom of mo&s;s, mixed with low, weak heath. The whole bore a more &s;triking re&s;emblance to Newfoundland, than to any other part of the world I had ever &s;een. However, he admits, in one place, that he &s;aw three or four &s;tacks of &s;weet and very fine-looking hay.</P>
<P>Of the trees, &s;ays Captain <HI>King,</HI> which fell under my notice, the principal was, the birch, the poplar, the alder (with the bark of which they &s;tain their leather), many &s;pecies of willow, and a kind of dwarf cedar, or pine, which yields a good e&s;&s;ence for beer. The birch the natives tap, and drink the juice, without mix|ture, or preparation; it it plea&s;ant and refre&s;hing, but &s;omewhat purgative. Birch-bark they convert into ve&s;&s;els, for all dome&s;tic purpo&s;es; and of the wood they make their &s;ledges and canoes. <HI>Krat&s;cheninikaff</HI> &s;ays, They convert the young bark of the birch into food,
<PB N="28" REF="29">
&s;tripping it off whil&s;t green, drying it in &s;lips, like vermicelli, and &s;tewing it with caviar. He &s;ays, there are al&s;o firs and larches, the &s;ervice-tree <HI>(padus &s;oliis annuis),</HI> and two &s;pecies of the white thorn, one bearing a red, and the other a black berry.</P>
<P>Of the &s;hrub kind, there are junipers, the mountain-a&s;h, wild ru&s;hes, ra&s;berries, and a variety of other berries, which the natives gather and boil into a thick jam, without &s;ugar. The&s;e are u&s;ed as &s;auce for dried fi&s;h, and are likewi&s;e eat in puddings.</P>
<P>In a wild &s;tate, &s;ays Captain <HI>King,</HI> we met with &s;e|veral, whole&s;ome vegetables, &s;uch as celery, angelica, chervil, garlick and onions, turneps, and turnep-ra|di&s;hes. They have a plant, peculiar to this country, that bears a dark red, &s;ingle flower, like a narci&s;&s;us, the root a bulbous one, which they collect in Augu&s;t, dry in the &s;un, and lay up for u&s;e. When roa&s;ted on embers, it &s;upplies the place of bread. After being baked in an oven, and pounded, it becomes an ex|cellent &s;ub&s;titute for flour, being mixed with all their &s;oups, &amp;c.</P>
<P>They have another plant, called, <HI>&s;weet gra&s;s;</HI> the botanical de&s;cription of which is, <HI>Heracleum Sibericum &s;oliis pinnatis, &s;oliolis quinis, intermediis &s;e&s;&s;ilibus, corol|lulis uniformibus.</HI> Hort. Up&s;al. 65. The time, &s;ays Captain <HI>King,</HI> when I took notice of it, was in May.
<PB N="29" REF="30">
It was about a foot and a half high, had much the ap|pearance of &s;edge, and was covered with a white down, like hoar fro&s;t, which might be rubbed off, and ta&s;ted &s;weet as &s;ugar, but was hot and pungent. The &s;talk is hollow, and con&s;i&s;ts of three or four joints, from each of which ari&s;e large leaves, and, when at its full growth, is &s;ix feet high.</P>
<P>They &s;crape off the down of this plant, lay the &s;talks in heaps to &s;weat, and, on their growing dry again, being put into mats, they will yield a &s;weet &s;accherine powder, which ex&s;udes from the hollow of the &s;talk, but in the proportion of four ounces of powder to 36 pounds of &s;talks; from which powder they di&s;till a &s;pirit.</P>
<P>They have, al&s;o, three other plants; one is a kind of ranunculus, of the gra&s;s of which they make a &s;ort of matting, which &s;erves for &s;acks, bed-cloaths, curtains, &amp;c. Another, which re&s;embles <HI>cyperoides,</HI> is carded, like wool, and of which they make cloths and wadding. The other, is of the common nettle; of the flax of which they make their nets.</P>
<P>Their animals &s;upply them with variety of &s;kins; &s;uch as the common fox, the <HI>Zibeline,</HI> or &s;able, the <HI>I&s;atis,</HI> or arctic fox, the varying hare, the mountain-rat, or earle&s;s marmout, the wea&s;el, the <HI>wolvene,</HI> or glutton, the <HI>argali,</HI> or wild &s;heep, rein-deer, bears, wolves, and dogs.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31">The fox <HI>(Canis vulpes),</HI> is the mo&s;t general object of the chace; as they are found, in great numbers, and of a variety of colours; &s;ome of a dark che&s;nut, &s;ome &s;triped with dark-coloured bars; &s;ome with black bel|lies, and the re&s;t of the body a light che&s;nut; &s;ome of a dark brown, &s;ome black, others of a &s;tone colour, and &s;ome few quite white. Their furs are thick and fine, and &s;uperior to tho&s;e of Siberia, or America. A variety of engines are contrived to catch this animal, which is as crafty here as in other countries. Some traps are calculated to fall on them, &s;ome to catch them by the feet, and others by the head. They &s;ometimes lay poi|&s;on for them, (the <HI>nux vomica</HI>): before the Ru&s;&s;ians came among them, they u&s;ed bows and arrows; but now every one is provided with a rifled-barrelled gun.</P>
<P>The mountain-rat is a beautiful, little animal, of a bright &s;hining colour, varying in hue, like the plumage of birds. It lives on roots and berries, is con&s;iderabiy le&s;s than a &s;quirrel, and eats, as does a &s;quirrel, erect on its hind legs, holding its food in its fore-paws. But</P>
<P>The &s;kin of the glutton is held here in the highe&s;t e&s;timation. The women adorn their hair with its parts, which are white; and a Kamt&s;chadale con&s;iders him&s;elf richly attired, when he has any of this fur about him. They have a &s;uper&s;titious notion, that angels are clad in the &s;kins of the&s;e animals. It is &s;aid, this creature is ea&s;ily tamed, and taught a number of plea&s;ant tricks.
<PB N="31" REF="32">
<HI>Krat&s;cheninikaff</HI> relates, that this &s;mall animal frequently de&s;troys deer, and the wild mountain-&s;heep; that they &s;catter mo&s;s, and bark, which the&s;e animals are fond of, at the bottoms of trees; and whil&s;t they are picking it up, drop &s;uddenly upon them, and fa&s;tening behind the head, &s;uck out their eyes.</P>
<P>The <HI>argali,</HI> or wild mountain-&s;heep <HI>(Capra ammon),</HI> an animal unknown, except in Cor&s;ica and Sardinia, is here in great plenty. Its &s;kin re&s;embles the deer's; but, in gait and appearance, it is more like a goat. It has two large, twi&s;ted horns, &s;ometimes weighing from 25 to 30 pounds, which, in running, it re&s;ts upon its back. The&s;e creatures are exceedingly nimble and &s;wift, haunt the mo&s;t craggy and mountainous parts, and make their way among the &s;teepe&s;t rocks, with an a&s;toni&s;hing agility. The natives work their horns into &s;poons, cups and platters; and have one frequently hanging at their girdles, to drink out of, when hunting. This animal is of the &s;heep-kind, and its fle&s;h is well-flavoured.</P>
<P>They have another remarkable animal, about the &s;ize of a &s;heep, called, a <HI>Kangaroo;</HI> re&s;embling, in ta&s;te, the fle&s;h of a hare, but better flavoured. Its body is formed like a goo&s;e, large&s;t behind, and growing taper to the head which re&s;embles that of a fawn; it has lips, and ears which it throws back, like a hare; in the upper jaw, it has &s;ix large teeth, in the under one, only two; its neck is &s;hort and &s;mall, near to which are the
<PB N="32" REF="33">
fore-feet, which have five toes, each with nails, like a cat. The fore-legs are kept clo&s;e to the brea&s;t, and &s;eem, like tho&s;e of the mole, to be u&s;ed only for dig|ging; they are &s;mall, and not more than eight inches long, having no knee-joint, but the hind legs have the cu&s;tomary joints of animals, and are 22 inches long. It has a tail tapering to the end, as long as its whole body, which it carries like a grey-hound; and the whole animal is covered with a &s;hort fur, of a dark mou&s;e, or grey-colour. It &s;its up on its hinder legs, like a hare in her form, and does not run, like other quadrupeds, but leaps, like a hare, or deer.</P>
<P>The dogs of this country are &s;omething like the Pomeranian, only a great deal larger, and the hair &s;omewhat coar&s;er. They are of various colours; but the generality, are of a dirty, cream colour. They yoke the&s;e dogs to &s;ledges, and thus travel on the &s;now. Towards the end of May, they are all turned loo&s;e, and left to provide for them&s;elves, through|out the &s;ummer, being &s;ure to return to their re&s;pective homes, when the &s;now begins to fall. Their food, in winter, is the head, entrails, and back bones of the &s;almon, which are put a&s;ide, and dried for that pur|po&s;e. Five dogs are yoked to a &s;ledge, two and two, with a leader; and, as a &s;ledge carries but one per&s;on, the number of them is very great. Captain <HI>King</HI>'s party took up 139. They never u&s;e the female for draught, but dogs that are cut. Whelps are trained to this

bu&s;ine&s;s, by tying them to &s;takes, with tight, leather thongs, made to &s;tretch; and having their food placed at a proper di&s;tance, out of their reach; &s;o that, by con|&s;tantly pulling and drawing, in order to reach their victuals, they acquire both &s;trength of limbs, and a habit of drawing.</P>
<P>The &s;ledge is a kind of half moon, or cre&s;cent, made of light, tough wood, bound together with wicker-work, the horns of the cre&s;cent upright, the circular part fixed by four legs, about two feet high, on two flat pieces of wood, like a Laplander's &s;now-&s;cates, five or &s;ix inches broad, extending a foot, at each end, beyond the body of the &s;ledge: the&s;e are turned up before, in the manner of a &s;cate, and &s;hod with bone. The body is about four-feet and a half long, and a foot wide, the hollow part of the cre&s;cent is covered with a fur, the fore-part ornamented with leather thongs, and ta&s;&s;els of coloured cloth; and the wood-work often &s;tained with red and blue. In front, is a cro&s;s bar, to which the harne&s;s is fixed, and on which are links of iron, and &s;mall bells, the jingling of which encourages the dogs. The per&s;on riding in this &s;ledge, &s;its &s;ide|ways, re&s;ting his feet on the lower part, and carries his provi&s;ions, &amp;c. wrapped up in a bundle behind him. Each dog has a collar, to which the reins are fa&s;tened; but the&s;e are of little u&s;e in governing them; the rider depends on the obedience of the dogs to his voice; for this purpo&s;e, the leader is &s;o well trained up, and with
<PB N="34" REF="35">
&s;uch a particular degree of care and attention, that one has been valued at 40 rubles, or 10 pounds Engli&s;h. The driver has a crooked &s;tick, which an&s;wers the end both of whip and reins; as, by &s;triking it into the &s;now, he can moderate their &s;peed, or &s;top them entirely; and, when they are lazy, or inattentive to his voice, he throws the &s;tick at them. The leader immediately picks it up, returns it to the driver, and ha&s;tens on. Should the driver lo&s;e his &s;tick, the dogs will in&s;tantly perceive it; and, unle&s;s their leader be of the mo&s;t &s;ober and re&s;olute kind, will immediately run a-head full &s;peed, and never &s;top till they are quite &s;pent; but as that is the ca&s;e &s;oon, it generally happens, that the carriage is either overturned, da&s;hed to pieces again&s;t &s;ome tree, or hurried down a precipice, and all buried in the &s;now. The accounts Captain <HI>King</HI> received, of the &s;peed, and extraordinary patience of hunger and fatigue of the&s;e dogs, would be &s;carcely credible, if they were not &s;upported by the be&s;t authority. Though fed only on the offal of &s;tinking and dead fi&s;h, they are deprived of this wretched food, a day before they &s;et out on a journey; and never &s;uffered to eat, but at the end of it. It is not unu&s;ual for them to continue thus fa&s;t|ing two whole days; in which time they will perform a journey of 120 miles. Travelling parties, &s;ays <HI>Kra&s;|chininikaff,</HI> are often overtaken with dreadful &s;torms of &s;now; on the approach of which they drive, with the utmo&s;t precipitation, into the neare&s;t wood, and are there obliged to &s;tay, till the tempe&s;t, which frequently
<PB N="35" REF="36">
la&s;ts &s;ix or &s;even days, is over, the dogs remaining all this time quiet and inoffen&s;ive, except that &s;ometimes, when pre&s;t by hunger, they will devour their reins, and other, leather parts of their harne&s;s. All the time the &s;ledges are preparing, the dogs howl, with a melancholy noi&s;e; but, as &s;oon as they are yoked, and ready to &s;et out, they change to a light, chearful yelping, which cea&s;es, the in&s;tant they &s;et off.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to travel in the&s;e &s;ledges; for, un|le&s;s a man keeps the exacte&s;t balance, he is liable to be over-turned every moment. In going down hill, they unyoke all the dogs, but one; and, in going up hill, the rider walks. When the &s;now is very &s;oft and ten|der, the rider quits the &s;ledge, and makes a path for it, by going before, with his &s;now-&s;hoes, &s;uch as the Laplanders and Ea&s;tjaiks u&s;e, thus pre&s;&s;ing the &s;now down. This is laborious work; but he has no al|ternative.</P>
<P>When they take &s;helter in a wood, from &s;torms, and this &s;torm is likely to la&s;t long, a Kamt&s;chadale will wrap him&s;elf up in his fur, and creep under the &s;now, where he lies as warm as in his hut. It is difficult to per&s;wade them to make a fire to warm them&s;elves, or dre&s;s their food; all the people of this climate, bear cold &s;o well, that they will &s;leep as &s;ound in the open air, as others do in warm beds.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">The coa&s;ts and bays of this country, are frequented by almo&s;t every kind of northern &s;ea-fowl, and, among the re&s;t, &s;ea-eagles, of beautiful plumage, and called <HI>a-an-gitche,</HI> from their &s;ingular and plea&s;ing cry, con|&s;i&s;ting of three di&s;tinct notes (according to mu&s;ic, <HI>f,</HI> on the fir&s;t &s;pace below, <HI>a, c,</HI> repeated), ri&s;ing, at equal in|tervals above each other. Whil&s;t on the &s;ubject of birds, I mu&s;t not omit the di&s;gu&s;ting mode of feeding of the arctic gull, which has procured it the name of the para&s;ite. This bird, which is &s;omewhat larger than the common gull, pur&s;ues the latter kind, whenever it meets it; the gull, after flying for &s;ome time, with loud &s;creams, and evident marks of great terror, drops its dung, which its pur&s;uer immediately darts at, and catches, before it falls into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>In the woods, are many eagles, of a prodigious &s;ize, and a great number of hawks, falcons, and bu&s;tards. Here are, al&s;o, woodcocks, &s;nipes, and two &s;orts of grow&s;e, or moor-ga ne; and, in the &s;ea, &s;eals, &s;ea-otters and whales, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Indeed, there is &s;uch plenty of fi&s;h of all kinds, that it may be con&s;idered as their &s;taple article of food. Fi&s;h may be here called the &s;taff of life, with more propriety than bread is in other countries. The whole they convert to various u&s;es: of the &s;kin they make &s;oles to their &s;hoes, and &s;traps and thongs; the fle&s;h they eat, &s;toring the fat for kitchen-u&s;e, and
<PB N="37" REF="38">
for their lamps. With their whi&s;kers, they &s;ew the &s;eams of their canoes, and make nets for large fi&s;h, and &s;hoe their &s;ledges with the jaw-bones. The other bones are worked up into knives, and other in&s;truments. Their inte&s;tines they clean, blow, and dry like blad|ders, to &s;tore their oil and fat in; and of the nerves, and veins, which are &s;trong, and &s;lip readily, they make excellent &s;nares; &s;o that every part has its u&s;e.</P>
<P>They catch quantities of flat fi&s;h, trout, herrings and cod; but the &s;almon-fi&s;hing is what the natives mo&s;t depend on for their winter-provi&s;ions; and the coa&s;ts abound here with all the different &s;pecies.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the inhabitants, their habitations, and employments.</HEAD>
<P>HISTORY is unacquainted with the origin of this people; and they, them&s;elves, know nothing of it; nor of any events that have happened in their na|tion. I believe it will be admitted, that, from this quarter of the world, the we&s;tern parts of North Ame|rica were peopled; e&s;pecially, when we come to give an account of the people on the coa&s;t oppo&s;ite to the mo&s;t ea&s;tern part of A&s;ia; for Captain <HI>King</HI> has proved, beyond a doubt, that the two great continents, in
<PB N="38" REF="39">
one part of Bhering's &s;treights, in latitude 66&deg;, are not more than 13 leagues a&s;under; and that, in this narrow &s;treight, are &s;everal i&s;lands. A great &s;imilarity is ob&s;ervable in the appearance of the two countries. Both are de&s;titute of wood. The &s;hores are low, with mountains ri&s;ing to a great height. Farther up the country, the depth of water, in the mid-way, between them, is 29 fathoms, gradually decrea&s;ing towards either continent, &s;o that it &s;eems as if they were divided by &s;ome violent concu&s;&s;ion of the earth; and the &s;treights between them being crowded with i&s;lands, favour the &s;ame idea. But to return to the Kamt&s;chadales, who, to judge of them by their language, figure, and man|ner, would be taken for a &s;eparate people, bearing &s;ome little relation to the i&s;landers in their neighbourhood. The&s;e, and other circum&s;tances, are a &s;trong proof of the antiquity of this people, who are as wild as the country it&s;elf. Few of them have any fixed habitations, but wander, with their herds of rein-deer, from place to place. They are divided into three nations; the Kamt|&s;chadales, Koriaks, and Kurilians. The Koraiks in|habit the northern parts, and round the Ea&s;tern ocean, almo&s;t to Anadir; and the Kurilians inhabit the i&s;lands in the Ea&s;tern &s;ea, reaching as far as tho&s;e of Japan.</P>
<P>They are of &s;mall &s;tature, &s;warthy, black hair, large heads, long, flat faces, &s;harp no&s;es, &s;mall eyes, &s;inking in; &s;mall, thin eye-brows, hanging bellies, &s;hort legs,
<PB N="39" REF="40">
and their arms &s;mall and &s;lender. They are &s;tout walkers, regardle&s;s of change of weather, and indiffer|ent to their manner of living. The women have black eyes, and eye-brows, a delicate &s;kin, lovely complexion, pretty hands, &s;mall feet, and are tole|rably well-made.</P>
<P>The antient dre&s;s of both &s;exes, differed from the pre&s;ent fa&s;hions, which have been introduced by the Ru&s;&s;ians. Men and women dre&s;s nearly alike: they wear a &s;hirt, loo&s;e breeches, like the Dutch, which fa&s;ten below the knee, with &s;tockings of &s;kin, the hair outwards, and a kind of &s;hoe, or bu&s;kin, laced round the leg. Their upper garment is a fur frock, like a carter's frock, that reaches almo&s;t to the knees, the hairy &s;ide of the &s;kin inwards. It has &s;leeves that clo&s;e at the wri&s;t, is bordered with dog's hair, and has a tip|pet of long dog's hair round the neck, which they can turn up again&s;t the face, to keep it warm. This frock, or &s;chube, has al&s;o a hood, which they occa&s;ionally pull over their heads. The women tie a handkerchief over their heads, that comes down low on the forehead, the knot behind, and the ends hanging down before on each &s;ide. The upper robe of the man is tied round his wai&s;t, with a girdle. Till the Ru&s;&s;ians came among them, they went almo&s;t naked; wearing only a fur-gir|dle, hand&s;omely embroidered, with a bag before, and an apron behind; and, at pre&s;ent, when at home, they often &s;it in this undre&s;s. Formerly, they wore bonnets
<PB N="40" REF="41">
made of bird's feathers, exactly like tho&s;e on the op|po&s;ite &s;hore of America, ea&s;t of Kamt&s;chatka; but they now dre&s;s, as do the Ru&s;&s;ians among them. They wear gloves con&s;tantly, even in the night-time. Formerly, they braided their hnir, in the Tartar fa&s;hion; now, they divide it on the top of the head, plait it at the neck, and adorn it with ribbands, gla&s;s beads, &amp;c. Some dre&s;s entirely in the Ru&s;&s;ian mode, wear cloaths of dif|ferent kinds, cloaths with buttons, and boots; and the women, when dre&s;&s;ed out, wear &s;ilk &s;hifts, with ruffles, &s;lippers, and a &s;ilk hankerchief round the head, imi|tating a curtain; which dre&s;s co&s;ts, at Kamt&s;chatka, at lea&s;t a hundred &s;ables, or fox-&s;kins, each &s;kin equal to a ruble, which the hu&s;band procures in the be&s;t manner he can. The Ru&s;&s;ians, in Kamt&s;chatka, wear the European dre&s;s; and the uniform of the troops quartered here, is dark green, faced with red. For|merly, they never wa&s;hed them&s;elves; now, they paint their faces, red and white. Their white paint is made of rotten wood, and Ru&s;&s;ian gla&s;s, calcined <HI>(Selenites);</HI> their red, of a &s;ea-weed <HI>(Sertularia),</HI> boiled in &s;eal's fat. With this, they rub their cheeks, till they are very red.</P>
<P>The Kuriles are better able to buy good cloaths than the Kamt&s;chadales; for the former can purcha&s;e, for one &s;ea-beaver, as much as the latter can for twenty foxes; and, one beaver, co&s;ts a Kurilian no more trou|ble in catching him, than five foxes do a Kamt&s;chadale;
<PB REF="42">

<PB N="41" REF="43">
for the latter mu&s;t be a good hunter, that catches more than 10 foxes in a winter; whereas, a Kurilian thinks him&s;elf unlucky, if he does not catch three beavers in the &s;ea&s;on; be&s;ides the numbers that are ca&s;t on &s;hore, by &s;torms.</P>
<P>Time immemorial, the Kamt&s;chadales have lived in fixed habitations, or villages. They formerly fortified the&s;e, by entrenchments, pali&s;adoes, and ramparts of earth; and, of cour&s;e, the Ru&s;&s;ians have given the&s;e villages the name of <HI>O&s;trog,</HI> or redoubt; but they are not &s;uffered to intrench them&s;elves now, though their villages are yet &s;o called. Every family has a winter, and a &s;ummer-hou&s;e. The <HI>Jourt,</HI> or winter-hou&s;e, is thus formed. They dig a hole in the ground, about five feet deep, the breadth and length proportioned to the number of inhabitants. In the middle of this hole, they erect four wooden pillars; over the&s;e, they lay balks, on which they form the roof, or cieling, leaving, in the middle, a &s;quare opening, which &s;erves them for window, chimney, and door: this done, they cover the building with gra&s;s and earth, &s;o that it re&s;embles, on the out&s;ide, a round hillock; but within, it is an oblong &s;quare, with the fire-place in one of the long &s;ides. Between the pillars and the walls of their hut, three parts round, they fix broad platforms, made of boards, rai&s;ed about &s;ix inches from the ground, like a taylor's &s;hop-board, on which each of the family lies &s;eparate|ly, having fir&s;t covered them with mats; on that &s;ide
<PB N="42" REF="44">
oppo&s;ite the fire, there are no benches, this place being left for their kitchen-furniture. The walls are adorn|ed with gra&s;s and mats. The&s;e huts are entered at the hole above, between the pillars, by an ill-formed lad|der, a kind of balk, with &s;teps cut in it; and, it being nearly over the fire-place, for the convenience of letting out the &s;moke, when they are heating their huts, the &s;teps of the ladder are &s;ometimes &s;o hot, and the &s;moke &s;o thick, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for any but a native to go up and down, without being burnt, or &s;uffocated; yet, a Kamt&s;chadale finds no difficulty in this, but fixes his toes on the &s;teps of the ladder, and mounts like a &s;quirrel; nor do the women he&s;itate to go through this &s;moke, with their children on their &s;houlders, though there is another opening, through which the women are allowed to pa&s;s; but if any <HI>man</HI> &s;hould pre&s;ume to do the &s;ame, he would be laughed at. Here they live all the winter. At their fea&s;ts and entertainments, the hotter the jourts are made, for the reception of the gue&s;ts, the greater the compliment. They betake them|&s;elves to the jourts, the middle of October, and continue in them till the middle of May. Five or &s;ix families live in one jourt; but each family has a &s;ummer-tent to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Balagans,</HI> or &s;ummer hou&s;es, are built with laths, like pidgeon-hou&s;es, rai&s;ed about 14 feet from the ground, on nine po&s;ts, fixed into the earth in three rows; &s;ome in circular form, and others in an an|gular.
<PB N="43" REF="45">
The balks inclining to each other at the top, give them a conical appearance. The walls, and roof are covered with wood, and thatched with long gra&s;s. The&s;e huts are very &s;mall, and many of them being built clo&s;e together, boards of communication, like bridges, are laid acro&s;s, one to the other; and fre|quently they fix boards round the&s;e tents, in which they &s;it abroad, in fine weather. The&s;e rai&s;ed huts have two doors each, in the &s;ides, oppo&s;ite to each other; are rai&s;ed thus high, to defend them from the plunder of wild bea&s;ts; and, to prevent the inconvenience of the damp ground, which is very moi&s;t in &s;ummer-time. As the&s;e huts are not very &s;trong, a bri&s;ker wind than u&s;ual &s;hakes them to and fro; but, notwith&s;tanding this precaution, of rai&s;ing their magazines &s;o much above ground, bears, in harve&s;t-time, will often make a &s;hift to climb up, and plunder them. Underneath the&s;e huts, they tie their dogs.</P>
<P>They have, al&s;o, other hou&s;es, called <HI>I&s;bas,</HI> or log-hou&s;es. The&s;e are rai&s;ed with long timbers, piled hori|zontally, the ends being let into one another, and the &s;eams caulked with mo&s;s. The roof is &s;loping, like that of our common cottages, and thatched with coar&s;e gra&s;s, or ru&s;hes. The in&s;ide con&s;i&s;ts of three apart|ments. At one end is the entry, a room that runs the whole width, and height of the hou&s;e; and holds their &s;ledges, harne&s;s, and bulky, hou&s;hold goods. This communicates with the middle, and be&s;t apartment,
<PB N="44" REF="46">
furni&s;hed with broad benches, or platforms, for eating and &s;leeping on. Out of this is a door into the kitch|en; one half of which is taken up by the fire-place, &s;o contrived, by being let into the wall that &s;eparates the kitchen from the middle room, as to warm them both. Over the&s;e two rooms are two lofts, to which they a&s;|cend by a ladder in the entry. Each room has two &s;mall windows, of talc, or fi&s;h-&s;kin, to let in the light The beams, and boards of the cieling, are dubbed with a hatchet (planes they have none), and, from the effects of the &s;moke, are black and &s;hining, as jet.</P>
<P>The governor's hou&s;e is built with logs, as above, and thatched, but much larger; con&s;i&s;ts of three hand&s;ome rooms, neatly papered, the windows of talc. The town of Bolcheret&s;k, where he re&s;ides, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal rows of low buildings, each con&s;i&s;ting of five or &s;ix dwellings, be&s;ides a well-looking church, a court-room, and barracks for the &s;oldiers. The inhabitants of this town, altogether, amount to between 5 and 600. The governor, Major <HI>Behm,</HI> lived here, with his wife and family.</P>
<P>The &s;outhern Kamt&s;chadales commonly build their villages (which &s;hall not, however, con&s;i&s;t of more than 20 or 30 huts), in thick woods, and other places, na|turally &s;trong, and not more than 15 miles from the &s;ea. Their &s;ummer-habitations are near the mouths of rivers; but tho&s;e upon the Perichin&s;ka &s;ea, and the
<PB N="45" REF="47">
Ea&s;tern ocean, build their villages very near the &s;hore. They con&s;ider the river, near their village, as the in|heritance of their tribe.</P>
<P>Before the arrival of the Ru&s;&s;ians, they u&s;ed &s;tones, and bones, in&s;tead of metals; out of which they made their hatchets, &s;pears, arrows, needles, and lances. Hatchets were made of the bones of whales and rein-deer; and &s;ometimes of agate and flint. They were &s;haped like a wedge, and fa&s;tened to crooked handles. With the&s;e they hollowed out their canoes, boats, di&s;hes, and troughs, which, with cans of birch-bark, con&s;ti|tuted the whole of their furniture; but with &s;o much trouble and time, that a canoe would take three years to make it, and a large boat one year. On this account, a large canoe, or trough, was held in great e&s;timation; and, a village in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a one, &s;et the highe&s;t value on it. In the&s;e bowls, they dre&s;s their victuals, and heat their broth, by throwing red-hot &s;tones into it.</P>
<P>Their knives were made of a greeni&s;h mountain-chry&s;tal, &s;harp pointed, &s;haped like a lancet, and &s;tuck into a wooden handle. Of &s;uch cry&s;tals were made the points of their arrows, &s;pears, and lancets, which la&s;t they now u&s;e to let blood. Needles were formed of &s;able-bones; and, with the&s;e, they u&s;ed to embroider very curiou&s;ly; but now, the Ru&s;&s;ians have furni&s;hed them with u&s;eful materials of all kinds.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48">Notwith&s;tanding they imitate the Ru&s;&s;ians, in a great degree, they have a number of peculiar cu&s;toms, &s;ome of which are very extraordinary, and which will always be retained, from the nature, and the inclemency of the weather. They prefer procuring of fire, by friction, to the u&s;e of flints and &s;punk. To procure fire, they make a &s;mall hole in a piece of dry wood, in which they turn a &s;tick, &s;o rapidly, between their hands, that it takes fire. The E&s;kimaux Indians, on the Labrador coa&s;t, do the &s;ame; and is a proof of their former communication. Pounded hay &s;erves them for tinder. As &s;ome of them delight in war, the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants are prohibited from &s;elling them any war|like in&s;truments; but they are ingenious enough to make &s;pears and arrows, out of the iron pots and ket|tles which they purcha&s;e; and they are &s;o dextrous, that, when the eye of a needle breaks, they will make a new one, and &s;o repeat it, till nothing remains but the point.</P>
<P>In former times, they never ate till they were hungry; but now, they have regular meals. As what they eat, is always cold, they have very fine teeth. The fle&s;h of land, and the larger, &s;ea-animals, is boiled, in troughs; the broth they drink out of ladles and bowls, and the meat they take out upon boards, and eat with their hands. They divide their fi&s;h into &s;ix parts: the &s;ides, and tail, are hung up to dry; the back, and the inner part of the belly, are prepared apart, and generally
<PB N="47" REF="49">
dried over the fire; the head is laid to &s;our, in pits, then eaten like &s;alt-fi&s;h, and much e&s;teemed, though it &s;tinks intolerably; the ribs, and fle&s;h upon them, are hung up and dried, and then pounded for u&s;e; the larger bones are dried, and given to the dogs.</P>
<P>Their &s;econd favourite food is caviar, or the roes of fi&s;h, which they dry in the air; and never take a jour|ney, or go a hunting, without it; and, if a Kamt|&s;chadale has a pound of this, he can &s;ub&s;i&s;t a great while, without any other provi&s;ion; for, every birch, and alder-tree, furni&s;hes him with bark, which, with his dried caviar, makes him an agreeable meal; but they cannot eat either &s;eparately, for the caviar &s;ticks to the teeth, like glue, and it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;wallow the bark, chew it ever &s;o long.</P>
<P>They have a third diet, called <HI>Chupriki,</HI> thus pre|pared. In their huts, over the fire-place, they make a bridge, of &s;takes, on which they lay a heap of &s;hell-fi&s;h, which there remains, till the hut is as warm as a bag|nio. It is there &s;moked and roa&s;ted, and has a very agreeable ta&s;te, and may be reckoned the be&s;t of all their cooking; for the whole juice, and fat, being prepared with a gradual heat, and kept in by the &s;kin, this &s;kin, when the fi&s;h is done, is &s;tripped off, and the guts taken out, and &s;pread, on mats, to dry.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50">They have al&s;o another di&s;h, called <HI>Huigul,</HI> which is, fi&s;h laid in pits to &s;our and putrify; and, though the &s;tench is intolerable, the Kamt&s;chadales e&s;teem it a perfume. This fi&s;h rots &s;o much, often in the&s;e pits, that it cannot be taken out but by ladles; in which ca&s;e, it is given to their dogs.</P>
<P>There is a principal di&s;h at all their fea&s;ts, called <HI>Selaga,</HI> made by pounding all &s;orts of roots and berries together, with the addition of caviar, and whale's and &s;eal's fat.</P>
<P>Before the conque&s;t of the Ru&s;&s;ians, they &s;eldom drank any thing but water, except at fe&s;tivals, when they drank water in which mu&s;hrooms had been &s;teeped. Now they drink &s;pirits as fa&s;t as the Ru&s;&s;ians. After dinner, they drink water; and, at night, &s;et a ve&s;&s;el by their bed-&s;ide, with the addition of &s;now, or ice, to keep it cool, and always drink it up before morning. In winter, they frequently amu&s;e them&s;elves, by throw|ing hands-full of &s;now into their mouths.</P>
<P>They eat and drink amazing quantities. Notwith|&s;tanding they are poor, they are very ho&s;pitable; but their ho&s;pitality is original. The ho&s;t, to do the honours of his hou&s;e, heats his winter-hut to a con&s;iderable de|gree, and, by never cea&s;ing to pre&s;s his gue&s;t to &s;tuff down his &s;hocking food, forces him ro &s;wallow &s;uch a quantity of it, that he mu&s;t vomit; and, the more he
<PB N="49" REF="51">
vomits, the more is he pre&s;&s;ed to eat. When a man has done &s;uch ju&s;tice to his friend's entertainment, he has &s;ecured to him&s;elf every &s;ervice it is in the power of his entertainer to do him. To be a little more par|ticular on this &s;ubject: When any man &s;eeks the friend|&s;hip of another, he invites him to his hut, and, for his entertainment, dre&s;&s;es as much of his be&s;t victuals, as might &s;erve ten people. As &s;oon as the &s;tranger comes into the hut, which is made hot for his re|ception, both he and the ho&s;t &s;trip them&s;elves naked, then great plenty of victuals is &s;et before the gue&s;t, and, whil&s;t he is eating, the ho&s;t throws water upon red-hot &s;tones, until he makes the hut in&s;upportably hot. The &s;tranger endeavours all he can to bear this ex|ce&s;&s;ive heat, and to eat up all the victuals; whil&s;t the ho&s;t is &s;till endeavouring to oblige him to complain of the heat, and beg to be excu&s;ed from eating all up. It is reckoned an affront to the ho&s;t, not to be able to accompli&s;h this; and a niggardline&s;s in the ho&s;t, not to urge his friend till he complies. During this operation, the ho&s;t eats nothing him&s;elf, and may go out of the hut to cool him&s;elf; but the &s;tranger is not &s;uffered to &s;tir, till he acknowledges him&s;elf overcome. At the&s;e fea&s;ts, they gorge to &s;uch a degree, as not to be able to bear the &s;ight of food for three days afterwards; and are &s;carce able to move.</P>
<P>When the &s;tranger has gorged him&s;elf to the full, and can no longer endure the heat, he purcha&s;es leave
<PB N="50" REF="52">
to retire, with pre&s;ents of dogs, cloaths, and other things This, however, is con&s;idered as no injury; for he expects, in turn, to treat his friend in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>In their banquets, they treat their friends much in the &s;ame way; except that they do not torment them with heat, nor expect any pre&s;ents. When they enter|tain with the fat of &s;eals, or whales, they cut it out in &s;lices, and the ho&s;t kneeling before his company, with one of the&s;e &s;lices in one hand, and a knife in the other, thru&s;ts the fat into their mouths, crying, in a &s;urly tone, <HI>Ta na;</HI> and, with his knife, cuts off all that hangs out of their mouths, after they are crammed as full as they can hold; &s;o do the Ea&s;tjaiks. <HI>(See the plates of the Ea&s;tjaiks).</HI></P>
<P>To kill a bear is to perform an heroic deed. On this occa&s;ion, the hunter, proud of his atchievement, invites his friends to a fea&s;t, which con&s;i&s;ts of pieces of lard, cut from the bear, and handed round among the gue&s;ts; each of whom gra&s;ps it in his hand, takes a bite, and pa&s;&s;es it to his next neighbour.</P>
<P>Part of their employment is, to make boats, and &s;ledges. Their boats are made of poplar-wood; but, the Kurilians, not having any wood, make u&s;e of what is thrown on &s;hore by the &s;ea. The Koraiks make their boats of the &s;kins of &s;ea-animals, &s;ewed together
<PB N="51" REF="53">
with whale's beards, and caulked with mo&s;s, or nettles, beaten &s;mall.</P>
<P>The&s;e boats hold two per&s;ons; one &s;its in the prow, the other in the &s;tern: they pu&s;h, again&s;t the &s;tream, with poles, but, when the current is &s;trong, this is &s;o trouble&s;ome, that they can &s;carcely advance two feet in ten minutes; notwith&s;tanding this, they will pu&s;h the&s;e boats, full loaded, 15 miles, and even twice the di&s;tance, when the &s;tream is not very &s;trong. The larger boats carry 30 or 40 puds; when goods are not heavy, they lay them on a float, or bridge, re&s;ting on two boats, joined together.</P>
<P>The men pa&s;s the greate&s;t part of their time in de|bauchery and idlene&s;s. If they pur&s;ue any employ|ment; it is hunting, fi&s;hing, and looking a little after their hou&s;hold affairs. The chace furni&s;hes them with game, but is always attended with danger. They are expert fi&s;hers, and are well acquainted with all the pro|per &s;ea&s;ons for it. Their nets are made with nettle-flax. At times, the men are al&s;o employed in build|ing huts, forming different uten&s;ils, and making bows and arrows. They cut gra&s;s for mats; and, contrary to the cu&s;tom of all other nations, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the kitchen belongs to the men; and they a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, not from &s;elfi&s;h motives, but from friend&s;hip. Bears they kill chiefly with a gun; and, there is &s;uch a na|tural affection in the&s;e animals, that, if they fire at a
<PB N="52" REF="54">
young cub, when the mother is near, and the cub drops, the dam will become enraged to a degree little &s;hort of madne&s;s, and, if &s;he gets &s;ight of her enemy, will only quit her revenge with her life. They never, therefore, fire at a cub, if its mother be near. If the dam be &s;hot, the cub will not leave her &s;ide, even after &s;he has been dead a long time; but continue about her, &s;hew|ing, by a variety of affecting actions and ge&s;tures, marks of the deepe&s;t affliction; and thus become an ea&s;y prey to the hunters.</P>
<P>Nor is their &s;agacity le&s;s extraordinary. In order to catch the bareens, which are too &s;wift of foot for them, they will have recour&s;e to the following &s;tratagem. The&s;e animals keep together in large herds, frequent|ing mo&s;tly the low grounds, and brow&s;ing at the feet of rocks and precipices. The bear hunts them by &s;cent, till in &s;ight, when he advances warily, keeping above them, and concealing him&s;elf among the rocks, as he makes his approaches, till he gets immediately over them, and nigh enough for his purpo&s;e. He then be|gins to pu&s;h down, with his paws, pieces of the rock, among the herd below; and, when he finds he has wounded one, &s;o as not to be able to e&s;cape, he pur&s;ues him, overtakes, and devours him.</P>
<P>From this digre&s;&s;ion, I will proceed to the employ|ment of women; which is, in tanning, converting net|tles into thread, mats and ba&s;kets, drying fi&s;h, and pre|paring
<PB N="53" REF="55">
i&s;ingla&s;s, roots and berries. To tan &s;kins, they &s;crape off the hair, rub it with fat and fi&s;h-roe, and &s;queeze it in, by twi&s;ting it in their arms. They make &s;hammoy leather of rein-deer &s;kins, by fermenting it with the bark of the alder-tree, and a decoction of the &s;ame bark. The Kamt&s;chadale women are excellent &s;emp&s;tre&s;&s;es, and embroider admirably with nettle-thread, and the tendons of animals. The women look al&s;o after the rein-deer and dogs. Women al&s;o are the only taylors, and &s;hoe-makers; it is a di&s;grace for the men to do any thing of the kind. They are al&s;o employed in dying &s;kins, in comforting, and curing the &s;ick.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of their manners, cu&s;toms, genius, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Kamt&s;chadales imitate the Ru&s;|&s;ians in a great degree, they have, as I &s;aid, a number of cu&s;toms peculiar to them&s;elves. They &s;leep quite naked, on mats, and their outer garments, cover|ing them&s;elves with their cloaths. They are a dirty, lazy people; and, &s;o carele&s;s, that they often find them|&s;elves expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t extreme indigence. They eat out of the &s;ame ve&s;&s;els with their dogs, and without cleaning them. They are commonly covered with
<PB N="54" REF="56">
vermin; and, like the Tungu&s;e, amu&s;e them&s;elves with catching and eating them. They let their nails grow to their natural length, which are always full of na&s;ti|ne&s;s. Be&s;ides painting of them&s;elves, the women en|deavour to add to their beauty, by pla&s;tering on their faces, the thin cawl, or &s;kin, which covers the entrails of the bear. Some of the&s;e ladies affect a mode&s;ty, wear veils, and turn away their eyes from &s;trange men. Tho&s;e that have not natural hair &s;ufficient, wear fal&s;e locks; and they will often put on to the amount of ten pounds weight, &s;o that their heads &s;hall look like a hay-cock.</P>
<P>They have a lively imagination, a &s;trong memory, and &s;uch a genius for imitation, that they copy, with ea&s;e, whatever they &s;ee. Their &s;ongs and tales are full of wit and plea&s;antry; they are great mimics, take off the way of &s;peaking, and motions of &s;trangers, and turn them into ridicule. They pay little regard to the cu&s;toms of their ance&s;tors; but, when they change, it is generally for the wor&s;e, and are more apt to follow bad examples than good. They &s;eldom give them&s;elves the trouble to reflect; and forget their faults too &s;oon to improve the future regulation of their conduct, for which they have no manner of concern. Their curi|o&s;ity is unbounded; in&s;omuch, that dreams are matters of &s;uch moment, as to claim all their attention. Love is their predominant pa&s;&s;ion, and good-nature, their chief characteri&s;tic. The&s;e form a &s;trange contra&s;t to
<PB N="55" REF="57">
their negligence and in&s;en&s;ibility, which makes them not only indifferent to the plea&s;ures of life, but even to life it&s;elf. Poverty gives them no concern; and nothing but hunger can call them to the chace; and then they &s;eldom go &s;o far, but they can return, at night, to the arms of their women. They care not how their food is dre&s;&s;ed, &s;o they have enough to fill their bellies; nor of what quality their liquor is of, &s;o as it does but intox|icate: in &s;hort, they are given to &s;en&s;uality. They talk, with regret, of the happy times of their ance&s;tors; who could walk up to the ancles, in the overflowing of a drunken debauch; whil&s;t, in their days, they can &s;carcely wet the &s;oles of their feet. Their immoderate lu&s;t proceeds even to be&s;tiality; and the men, con|trary to the cu&s;tom of other Ea&s;tern nations, make them&s;elves the voluntary &s;laves of the women, to gra|tify their la&s;civious de&s;ires, Pedera&s;ty is practi&s;ed al|mo&s;t publicly. The women too, are as much addicted to a profligate libertini&s;m, as the men; and not only indulge with their own nation, and expect &s;uch a return for every &s;ervice they do to &s;trangers, but al&s;o pur&s;ue unnatural means, to gratify their pa&s;&s;ions. <HI>Steller,</HI> who was among them a long time, attributes this in&s;a|tiable lu&s;t, to their daily u&s;e of half-rotten fi&s;h, fi&s;h-roe, rancid fat and onions; but, e&s;pecially, to their exce&s;&s;ive indolence.</P>
<P>They are remarkable for their cowardice, boa&s;ting, and &s;lavi&s;hne&s;s to people who u&s;e them hard; and, for
<PB N="56" REF="58">
their ob&s;tinacy, and contempt, of tho&s;e who treat them with gentlene&s;s.</P>
<P>They have a very confu&s;ed notion of honour and &s;hame. Kind treatment has no effect upon them; therefore, to render them more civilized, le&s;s knavi&s;h, and more &s;erviceable than they naturally are, they mu&s;t be treated with &s;everity. Plea&s;ure and inaction are their only objects; of cour&s;e, they &s;teal nothing but women and dogs, which formerly were the con|tinual cau&s;es of national war. They are cowardly, and ba&s;e, to an extreme; gratifying their revenge, only by the darke&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ecret means. The lea&s;t ap|prehen&s;ion of danger, drives them to de&s;pair; and, as they have no hope of futurity, they fly to &s;uicide as a relief, not only from pre&s;ent, but even from imaginary, evil. Not only tho&s;e who are confined for offences, but &s;uch as are di&s;contented with their lot, prefer a voluntary death to an unea&s;y life, and the pains of di&s;ea&s;e. The ancient people of the north, &s;ays <HI>Aelian,</HI> u&s;ed to kill men, when they became, through old age, a burthen to them&s;elves and &s;ociety; and children will &s;trangle their aged parents, at their own reque&s;t, as do the E&s;kimaux Indians, which we have &s;een. But the Kamt&s;chadales will di&s;patch them&s;elves, when any di&s;|ea&s;e has rendered them infirm. They want courage to bear great pain, and always &s;eek relief in &s;uicide. If a woman brings forth twins, they commonly kill one of them (and, perhaps, throw them to their dogs); like|wi&s;e
<PB N="57" REF="59">
every weak child, and &s;uch as are born with any defect. If a woman finds her pregnancy an incon|venience to her, &s;he endeavours to effect a mi&s;car|riage, that &s;he may more ea&s;ily renew the indulgence of her de&s;ires. The &s;ick, and malefactors, meet the mo&s;t terrible death, without any emotion.</P>
<P>In their &s;ocial life, the men &s;ecure the affections of the women, by rough and free care&s;&s;es, by little a&s;&s;i|duities, and by acts of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience. But the men, among them&s;elves, take no manner of notice of one another, either by bowing, &s;haking hands, or other &s;alutations. Their abu&s;ive words are, <HI>Ko&s;cha, Koaughwit&s;ch, Kana, Kaikt&s;chit&s;ch;</HI> that is, dog, hanged villain, devil; and accu&s;ations of prepo&s;terous lu&s;ts.</P>
<P>Their diver&s;ions con&s;i&s;t of fea&s;ts, at which they eat and drink, &s;ing, whi&s;tle through a pipe made of a cab|bage-&s;talk, dance, and tell &s;tories. Singing is the mo&s;t favourite amu&s;ement of the women. Their voices are agreeable, and their &s;ongs are either national, or com|po&s;ed <HI>extempore.</HI> The exploits of their gods, and he|roes, and the adventures which their ance&s;tors, and them&s;elves, have met with in hunting, are the &s;ubjects of their tales, and fabulous &s;tories; and their dances, like tho&s;e of the Ea&s;tjaiks, are pantomimic. Their bear-dance, is an exact counterpart of every attitude and ge&s;ture, peculiar to this animal, through its various
<PB N="58" REF="60">
po&s;itions; and this is the foundation, and ground-work, of all their other dances.</P>
<P>When a Kamt&s;chadale re&s;olves to marry, he looks about for a bride, in &s;ome of the neighbouring villages, &s;eldom in his own; and, when he finds one to his mind, he di&s;covers his inclination to her parents, de&s;ir|ing that he may have the liberty of &s;erving them for &s;ome time. This permi&s;&s;ion he readily obtains; and, during his &s;ervice, &s;hews an uncommon zeal in &s;erving them. The time of his &s;ervice expired, he de&s;ires the liberty of &s;eizing his bride, which, if he plea&s;ed her parents, in his &s;ervice, is granted; if di&s;approved of, he is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, with &s;ome &s;mall reward. To <HI>catch a girl,</HI> is their term for marriage; and, when he has obtained liberty to &s;eize her, he &s;eeks every opportunity of find|ing her alone, or with few people; for, during this time, all the women of the village are obliged to protect her; be&s;ides, &s;he has two or three different coats, and is &s;o &s;watned round with fi&s;h-nets and &s;traps, that &s;he has &s;carce more motion than a &s;tatue. If the bride|groom happens to find her alone, or with few in com|pany, he throws him&s;elf upon her, and begins to tear off her cloaths; for, to &s;trip the bride naked, is the marriage-ceremony. This is not always an ea&s;y ta&s;k; for, though &s;he is able to make but little re&s;i&s;tance her|&s;elf, yet, if any women are about her, they all fall on the bridegroom, without mercy, beating, and dragging him by the hair, &s;cratching his face, and u&s;ing every
<PB REF="61">
<FIGURE>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="59" REF="62">
method they can think off, to prevent him accompli&s;h|ing his de&s;ign. If the bridegroom is &s;o happy as to obtain his wi&s;h, he immediately runs from her, and the bride, as a proof of being conquered, calls him back, with a &s;oft and tender voice; and thus the mar|riage is concluded. This victory is &s;eldom attained at once; but, &s;ometimes, the conte&s;t will la&s;t a whole year; and, after every attempt, the bridegroom is ob|liged to take time to recover &s;trength, and to heal the wounds he has received. There is an in&s;tance of one, who after having per&s;evered for &s;even years, in&s;tead of obtaining his bride, was rendered a cripple; the women having u&s;ed him very barbarou&s;ly.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the ceremony is over, he is at liberty, next night, to go to her bed; and, the day following, carries her off to his own village. After &s;ome time, the bride and bridegroom, return to the bride's rela|tions, where the marriage-fea&s;t is celebrated in the fol|lowing manner, of which the writer of this account was an eye-witne&s;s, in 1739.</P>
<P>The bridegroom, his friends, and wife, vi&s;ited the father-in-law, in three boats. All the women were in the boats, and the men, being naked, pu&s;hed them along with poles. About one hundred paces from the village, to which they were going, they landed, began to &s;ing, and u&s;ed conjurations, with tow fa&s;tened in a rod, muttering &s;omething over a dried fi&s;h's head,
<PB N="60" REF="63">
which they wrapped in the tow, and gave to an old woman to hold. The conjuration being over, they put on the bride a &s;heep-&s;kin coat, and tied four images about her. Thus loaded, &s;he had &s;ome difficulty to move. They then returned to their boats, and came up to the village, where they landed, a &s;econd time; at this landing-place, a boy of the village met them, and taking the bride by the hand, led her along, all the women following.</P>
<P>When the bride came to the hut, they tied a &s;trap round her, by which &s;he was let down the ladder, the old woman who carried the fi&s;h's head, going before her. This head, &s;he laid down at the foot of the lad|der, where it was trodden on by the bride and bride|groom, and all the people pre&s;ent, and then thrown into the fire.</P>
<P>All the &s;trangers took their places, having fir&s;t &s;tripped the bride of her &s;uperfluous ornaments. The bride|groom heated the hut, dre&s;&s;ed the victuals, which they had brought with them, and entertained the inhabitants of the village. The next day, the ma&s;ter of the hut entertained the &s;trangers, winh great abundance, who at the third day departed; the bride and bridegroom remaining to work &s;ome time with their father. The &s;uperfluous parts of the bride's dre&s;s were di&s;tributed among her relations, who were obliged to return her pre&s;ents of far greater value.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64">The&s;e ceremonies only relate to a fir&s;t marriage; for, in the marriage of a widow, the man and woman's agreement is &s;ufficient, but he mu&s;t not take her to him&s;elf, before her &s;ins are taken away. This can only be done by &s;ome &s;tranger's lying with her once; but as this taking off of &s;in is con&s;idered by the Kamt&s;cha|dales as very di&s;honourable for the man, it was formerly difficult to find one to undertake it; &s;o that the poor widows were at a great lo&s;s, befure the Ru&s;&s;ians came among&s;t them, &s;ince which, they have been at no great want of &s;trangers, to take away their &s;ins.</P>
<P>Marriage is forbidden only between father and daugh|ter, mother and &s;on; a &s;on-in-law may marry his mo|ther-in-law, and a father-in-law his daughter-in-law, and fir&s;t cou&s;ins marry frequently. Their divorce is ea&s;y, con&s;i&s;ting only in &s;eparating beds. In &s;uch ca&s;e, the man immediately marries again; and the woman accepts another hu&s;band, without any further ce|remony.</P>
<P>A Kamt&s;chadale has two or three wives, with whom he &s;leeps by turns. Sometimes he keeps them all in one hut, and &s;ometimes in different ones. With every maid he marries, he is obliged to to go through the above-mentioned ceremonies. Though the&s;e peo|ple are fond of women, they are not &s;o jealous as the Koraiks. Nor are the women more jealous; for, even their wives, will live with one hu&s;band in great
<PB N="62" REF="65">
harmony, even though he &s;hould al&s;o keep con|cubines.</P>
<P>Like the Bra&s;ilians, and Americans, and the ancient Thracians, they &s;et no great value on the virginity of their brides; and hence proceeds the genero&s;ity with which the Kamt&s;chadale girls be&s;tow their favours on the Ru&s;&s;ians, having no rea&s;on to fear any reproaches on this head from their future hu&s;bands. The Ko&s;&s;acks, and &s;oldiers of the garri&s;ons, had formerly little &s;era|glios at their &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Though many women do all they can to di&s;qualify them&s;elves from breeding, there are &s;ome who ar|dently wi&s;h to be mothers, and, to that end, u&s;e &s;uper|&s;titious means. Some &s;wallow &s;piders; others, call in the aid of magicians, who perform a great many ridi|culous ceremonies to render them fruitful. The women are not very fruitful: they have, commonly, very ea&s;y births; for, in a quarter of an hour afterwards, they will appear abroad, about their ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, and without any change of countenance. They have no profe&s;&s;ed midwives; the mother, or neare&s;t relation, performing the office. Some friend, who calls in to &s;ee them, gives a name to the child, the mo&s;t common of which are, <HI>Ro&s;ko, Pickengour, Aphaka.</HI> They have a very tender, but ill-directed affection for their children; who, &s;o far from being obedient to them, treat them with har&s;hne&s;s and cruelty.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="66">The Kamt&s;chadales are, in general, &s;trong and healthy. Some of them are maimed, from accidents in travelling, or falling from high rocks. The &s;curvy, ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, foul humours, the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, pleuri&s;y, mortifications, jaundice, and inflammations of the eyes, are their common di&s;orders. For the &s;curvy, they eat wild berries, and raw fi&s;h. The venereal di&s;ea&s;e was among them, before the arrival of the Ru&s;&s;ians. Inflamed eyes proceeds from the dazzling whitene&s;s of the &s;now. They formerly inoculated their children for the &s;mall-pox, by &s;cratching the face with a fi&s;h-bone, dipped in variolous matter; but, as this di&s;temper has made no appearance for a number of years, they dropped this &s;alutary practice, when, in 1758, it was unluckily brought there by a &s;oldier, who had a long time been cured of it; and, this &s;courge of the human race, then raged &s;o dreadfully, as to &s;weep away two-thirds of the nation.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, they think are inflicted upon them by the &s;pirits that inhabit particular groves, if they ig|norantly happen to cut down a tree there. Their chief remedies con&s;i&s;t in charms and conjurations, though they neglect not more &s;pecific remedies. They very thankfully acknowledge, that they owe the little ad|vancement they have made in phy&s;ic and &s;urgery to the bears; that, by remarking with what herbs the&s;e animals rub the wounds they receive, and what they have recour&s;e to when &s;ick and languid, they have
<PB N="64" REF="67">
become acquainted with mo&s;t of the &s;imples in u&s;e among them.</P>
<P>When bitten, by a dog, or a wolf, they lay the brui&s;ed leaves of the <HI>Ulmaria</HI> upon the wound, drinking a decoction of them at the &s;ame time. The leaves and &s;talks, pounded, they u&s;e in brui&s;es; and u&s;e the de|coction for the belly-ach, tooth-ach, and &s;curvy. In the jaundice, they take the roots of the <HI>Iris &s;ylve&s;tris,</HI> clean them, beat them in warm water, &s;queeze out the juice, and u&s;e it as a cly&s;ter, two or three times a-day; this purges and relieves. If, after &s;ome time, it does not cure, they repeat it. They let blood, by rai&s;ing the &s;kin, with wooden pincers, and piercing it with a chry&s;tal lancet. In pains of the back, they rub the part afflicted, before a fire, with the root of <HI>cicuta,</HI> being careful not to touch the loins, which, they &s;ay, would occa&s;ion &s;pa&s;ms. In pains of the joints, they place a pyramid of birch fungus over it, &s;et it on fire, and let it burn till it comes to the &s;kin, which then cracks, and leaves a wound that di&s;charges a good deal of matter. The root of the <HI>anemonides,</HI> or ranunculus, is made u&s;e of to poi&s;on their enemies; and they, al&s;o, poi&s;on their arrows with it.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of burying their dead, they bind a &s;trap round the neck of the corp&s;e, draw it out, and leave it near the hut, to be devoured by their dogs; under a notion that, &s;uch as are eaten by dogs, will drive with
<PB N="65" REF="68">
fine dogs in the other world; and, by leaving them near the hut, they &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e evil &s;pirits, whom they imagine were the cau&s;e of its death, &s;eeing the dead body, may be &s;atisfied with the mi&s;chief they have done. However, they generally remove to &s;ome other place, when any one has died in the hut, and leave the body in it.</P>
<P>All the cloaths of the decea&s;ed, they throw away; from an opinion, that any one wearing them, will come to an untimely end. After the decea&s;e of any one, they u&s;e the following purification: going to the wood, they cut a few rods, of which they make a ring, and creeping through it twice, they carry it to the wood, and throw it towards the wood. Tho&s;e who dragged out the body, are obliged to catch two birds, of &s;ome &s;ort or other, one of which they burn, and eat the other with the whole family. This purification is performed on the &s;ame day; for, before this, they dare not enter any one's hut, but their own; nor will any one enter theirs. In commemoration of the dead, the whole fa|mily dines upon a fi&s;h; the fins of which they burn in the fire.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of their learning, language, religion, government, trade, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Kamt&s;chadales have no knowledge, but what they acquire in their narrow circle of life, and in pur&s;uance of the impul&s;es of nature. They have neither letters, nor hieroglyphics. Their language is national and peculiar; though inclining to that of the Mongols; and, as it adopts no foreign term, is very difficult to learn. They endeavour to give every thing &s;uch a name, as will expre&s;s the property of it; but if they do not under&s;tand the thing thoroughly them|&s;elves, they take a name from &s;ome foreign language, which, perhaps, has no relation to the thing it&s;elf. Thus, for example, they call a prie&s;t, <HI>Bogbog;</HI> becau&s;e, probably, they heard him u&s;e the word bog-bog, God. Bread, they call <HI>Brigh&s;atin Aug&s;h,</HI> that is, Ru&s;&s;ian root.</P>
<P>Probably, the Kamt&s;chadales, and the Mongols, might formerly have been one and the &s;ame people; for, as the Chine&s;e Mongols have, &s;o have the Kamt&s;cha|dales, many words ending in <HI>ong, ing, &s;ang, chin, cha, ching, k&s;i,</HI> and <HI>k&s;ung.</HI></P>
<P>They are ignorant of the cau&s;es of eclip&s;es; but, when they happen, they carry fire out of their huts, and pray the luminary eclip&s;ed, to &s;hine as before.
<PB N="67" REF="70">
They know only three con&s;tellations; viz. the Great Bear, the Pleiades, and the three &s;tars in Orion. They count by tens, and are &s;uch poor arithmeticians, that they cannot arrive at that number, without u&s;ing their fingers.</P>
<P>It is very diverting to &s;ee them attempt to count above ten; for, having reckoned the fingers of both hands, they cla&s;p them together, which &s;ignifies ten; then, they begin with their toes, and count to 20; after which, they are confounded, and cry, <HI>Metcha?</HI> that is, "Where &s;hall I take more?" They reckon ten months in the year, &s;ome longer, and &s;ome &s;horter; and divide them, by the order of particular occur|rences; as the month, <HI>Koakouai&s;ch,</HI> is, that when the cuckoo is fir&s;t heard, and &s;o on. They divide our year into two; &s;o that winter is one year, and &s;ummer an|other. The &s;ummer-year begins in May; and the winter, in November. They do not di&s;tingui&s;h the days by any particular appellation, nor form them into weeks, or months; but mark their epochs, by &s;ome one moveable event; as the raging of the &s;mall pox, the arrival of the Ru&s;&s;ians, the great rebellion, and the like.</P>
<P>Like all other barbarous nations, the Kamt&s;chadales have no notions of a Deity; but what are ab&s;urd, ri|diculous, and &s;hocking to a humanized mind. Their ancient, national religion, is Schamani&s;m; their idolatrous
<PB N="68" REF="71">
wor&s;hip, like that of the Jakutes. They call their god, <HI>Kutchu,</HI> but pay him no religious wor&s;hip; and, the only u&s;e they make of his name, is to divert them&s;elves with it; they relate &s;uch &s;candalous &s;tories of him, as one would be a&s;hamed to repeat. Among other things, they reproach him with having made &s;o many &s;teep hills, &s;o many &s;mall and rapid rivers, &s;o much rain, and &s;o many &s;torms; and, in all their troubles, they up|braid and bla&s;pheme him. However, they celebrate always three days in the month of November, hence called, the month of purification, after their &s;ummer, or harve&s;t-labour, is over. They con&s;ider it as a &s;in, to do any work, or make any vi&s;its, before the&s;e holi|days; the breach of which they never &s;uffer to pa&s;s, without expiation. From hence, we may &s;ee, that the ance&s;tors of the&s;e people, were accu&s;tomed to offer up the fir&s;t-fruits of their &s;ummer-labours to God; and, at the &s;ame time, make merry with one another. Their ceremonies, in the celebration of their holidays, are &s;illy to the extreme, and con&s;i&s;t of many ridiculous antics.</P>
<P>They erect a pillar on a large wide plain, which they bind round with rags. Whenever they pa&s;s this pillar, they throw a piece of fi&s;h, or &s;ome other victuals, at it, and near it never gather any berries, or kill any bea&s;t, or bird. This offering, they think, pre&s;erves their lives, which, otherwi&s;e, would be &s;hortened; however, they offer nothing of any u&s;e to them&s;elves; only the
<PB N="69" REF="72">
fins and tails of fi&s;h, or &s;uch things as they would be obliged to throw away. In this all the people of A&s;ia agree, offering, to their idols, only &s;uch things as are u&s;ele&s;s to them&s;elves. Be&s;ides the&s;e pillars, &s;everal other places are e&s;teemed &s;acred; &s;uch as burning and &s;moking mountains, hot &s;prings, and &s;ome particular woods, which they imagine are inhabited by devils, the chief of whom they call, <HI>Kanna.</HI> The world, they be|lieve, is eternal, and the &s;oul immortal; and, that it &s;hall be again joined to the body, and live eternally, &s;ubject to fatigues and troubles, as in this pre&s;ent life; with this difference only, that they &s;hall have greater plenty of every nece&s;&s;ary. Even the &s;malle&s;t animal, they imagine, will ri&s;e again, and dwell under the earth. They conceive the earth to be flat, and that, under it, there is a firmament, like ours; and, under that firmament, another earth, in which, when we have &s;ummer, they have winter, and, when we have winter, they have &s;ummer. With regard to future rewards and puni&s;hments, they believe, that, in the other world, the rich will be poor, and the poor rich.</P>
<P>Their notions of vice and virtue are equally extra|vagant. They believe every thing lawful that gra|tifies their pa&s;&s;ions; and conceive, that only to be a &s;in, from which they apprehend danger and ruin: &s;o that, they neither reckon murder, &s;elf-murder, adultery, oppre&s;&s;ion, or the like, any wickedne&s;s; on the con|trary, they look on it as a mortal &s;in, to &s;ave any one
<PB N="70" REF="73">
that is drowning; becau&s;e, according to their notions, who ever &s;aves him, will be &s;oon drowned him&s;elf. They account it al&s;o a &s;in, to bathe in, or drink hot water; or to go up to the burning mountains. They have, be&s;ides the&s;e, innumerable, ab&s;urd cu&s;toms; &s;uch as, &s;craping the &s;now from their feet with a knife, or whetting their hatchets upon the road. It may, how|ever, be &s;aid, that they are not the only people who have ridiculous &s;uper&s;titions.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above-mentioned gods, they pay a reli|gious regard to &s;everal animals, from whom they ap|prehend danger. They often fire at the holes of &s;ables and foxes. When fi&s;hing, they intreat the whales, or &s;ea-hor&s;es, not to overturn their boats; and, in hunt|ing, be&s;eech the bears and wolves not to hurt them.</P>
<P>They fill almo&s;t every place in heaven and earth, with different &s;pirits; and offer them &s;acrifices, upon every occa&s;ion. Some carry little idols about them, or fix them up in their huts; but, with regard to God, they not only neglect, as I have &s;aid, to wor&s;hip him, but, in ca&s;e of troubles and misfortunes, cur&s;e and bla&s;pheme him.</P>
<P>Every old woman is looked on as a witch, and an interpreter of dreams; and there are magicians, who pretend to conjure, and are called, <HI>Gui&s;pahas.</HI> In their conjurations, they whi&s;per to the fins of fi&s;h, and &s;ome
<PB N="71" REF="74">
other things; by which they think to cure di&s;ea&s;es, avert misfortunes, and foretell futurity. They are, in general, great ob&s;ervers of dreams, which they relate to each other in the morning, as &s;oon as they awake; judging, from thence, of their future good, or bad fortune; and &s;ome of the&s;e dreams have their inter|pretations fixed and &s;ettled. Be&s;ides this, they pretend to chiromancy, and to foretel a man's fate, by the lines of his hand.</P>
<P>All this ignorance, and &s;uper&s;tition, will, however, be &s;oon rooted out from among them. Their &s;trong bent to imitation, has led them to embrace chri&s;tianity; &s;o that, at pre&s;ent, there are few who are not con|verted. Chapels of wor&s;hip are built in almo&s;t every village, and &s;chools erected, to which the Kamt&s;chadales &s;end their children, with great plea&s;ure. But, as the people neither fear, nor love God, and the very idea of a Providence appearing to them ridiculous, they make no better chri&s;tians than they were idolaters; all their actions concentering in &s;en&s;uality, and having no con|ception of a paradi&s;e, de&s;titute of an indulgence of their pre&s;ent de&s;ires. The &s;chools, however, will teach their ri&s;ing generation better principles; there is little doubt, but the chri&s;tian religion, being there tran&s;|planted, will ri&s;e and flouri&s;h in that remote corner of the world, as it hath done in more &s;outhern climes.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="75">What &s;hall be &s;aid of their government? Their &s;o|cieties are di&s;tributed into families: each family has a &s;eparate o&s;tro&s;chok, or hamlet, con&s;i&s;ting of a few &s;mall hou&s;es, and &s;ituated, in general, near &s;ome river. When a young man marries, he removes into the hamlet to which his wife belongs. When a village becomes too populous, they &s;eparate, and form a new village, but always on the &s;ame river. The olde&s;t of the&s;e vil|lages, the &s;tock of collateral hamlets, enjoys &s;ome pre|rogatives, as pretending to have been the abode of one of the &s;ons of the founder of the Kamt&s;chadale nation, who mu&s;t be a de&s;cendant of their god, Kutchu. They pay a deference to old men of the villages; but their authority is very circum&s;cribed. They have no pu|ni&s;hment, but for theft, and murder. The fingers of a thief are burnt, that he may be known and dete&s;ted; a murderer is delivered into the hands of tho&s;e whom he has injured, who may, and often do, make him &s;uffer the mo&s;t cruel torments.</P>
<P>Formerly, whole villages were often in a &s;tate of warfare; which aro&s;e from their frequent attempts to carry off the women from one another's hamlet; and, though they had no ambition of encrea&s;ing their power, or enlarging their territories, before the Ru&s;&s;ian con|que&s;t, they had &s;uch frequent quarrels, that &s;eldom a year pa&s;&s;ed, without one village, or other, being en|tirely ruined.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="76">Their wars were carried on, more by &s;tratagem than bravery; for, being naturally cowards, they never at|tack but from nece&s;&s;ity. Their &s;elf-murder ari&s;es more from fear of encountering misfortunes, than daring to die. When they do attack, it is in this manner: they &s;teal into the enemy's village by night, and &s;urpri&s;e them; which is ea&s;ily done, as they keep no watch. Thus a &s;mall party may de&s;troy a large village; hav|ing nothing more to do, than to &s;ecure the mouth of a hut, &s;uffer none to come out but one at a time, and, of cour&s;e, knock down that one, or oblige him to &s;ub|mit and be bound. In their former wars with the Koraiks, when a village was blockaded, and they had no hope of di&s;lodging the enemy, it was common for the men, fir&s;t to kill all the women in the place, and then them&s;elves; knowing, that were they to &s;urrender, they would not meet a better fate. The bow and ar|row, the pike, and the club, were all their offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive arms. Their quivers are made of the larch-wood, glued round with birch-bark; their bow-&s;trings, of the blood-ve&s;&s;els of the whale: their arrows are about four feet long, pointed with bone, and are very dangerous, being all poi&s;oned; &s;o that a per&s;on wounded by them, generally dies in 24 hours, unle&s;s the poi&s;on is &s;ucked out. They have al&s;o coats of mail, made of mats, or &s;eal-&s;kin, cut into thongs, and plaited together. The&s;e are worn on the left &s;ide, tied, with thongs, upon the right. Behind, is fixed a high board, to defend their heads; and another before, to guard the heart.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77">It is remarkable, that when they march, two never go a-brea&s;t, but follow each other in the &s;ame path; which, by u&s;e, becomes very deep and narrow; &s;o that, it is impo&s;&s;ible for one that is not u&s;ed to it, to walk therein, for they always &s;et one foot &s;trait before the other, in walking.</P>
<P>Their con&s;tant ho&s;tilities furni&s;hed opportunities of a&s;piring to the dignity of <HI>Toyons,</HI> or chiefs of parties; but their pre&s;ent &s;ituation has made a change; the po|litical relation in which they &s;tand, is almo&s;t the &s;ame with that of the other Siberians. They have Ru&s;&s;ian over&s;eers; and are obliged to give ho&s;tages, for greater &s;ecurity. Every tributary-male mu&s;t furni&s;h a &s;able-&s;kin, or &s;ome other, of equal value. The Ru&s;&s;ians have divided them, according to the o&s;trogs, where they pay their tribute; and, according to this divi&s;ion, there are about 3000 natives, including men, women, and children; but were the number three times as great, the inhabitants would be but few, for &s;uch an extent of ground; and &s;till fewer, if we con&s;ider, that, in the mo&s;t northern o&s;trogs, the Koraiks, belonging to them, are included in the number.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians have five forts in this country; and near the &s;ame number at Ingiga, which, though to the north of the penin&s;ula, are under the governor of Kamt|&s;chatka. In the&s;e &s;orts, are about four hundred Ru&s;&s;ians and Co&s;&s;acks; and, be&s;ides this, there are &s;ome few
<PB N="75" REF="78">
Ru&s;&s;ian traders, emigrants and exiles. In &s;ome of the o&s;trogs, or hamlets, are but 20 or 30 natives. Captain <HI>King</HI> pa&s;&s;ed four exten&s;ive o&s;trogs, and did not find a &s;ingle inhabitant in them; &s;o thinly are they &s;cattered: &s;o that, in the pre&s;ent, dimini&s;hed &s;tate of the natives, with fre&s;h &s;upplies of Ru&s;&s;ians and Co&s;&s;acks perpetually, pouring in and intermixing with the natives by mar|riage, it is probable, that in le&s;s than half a century, there will be very few of them left.</P>
<P>The governor of this country, in 1779, re&s;igned that command the &s;ame year, and left the place; and was &s;ucceeded by Captain <HI>Shmaleff.</HI> The Ru&s;&s;ian govern|ment is here mild and equitable, but a military one. The natives are permitted to chu&s;e their own ma|gi&s;trates, from among them&s;elves; in the way, and with the &s;ame power, they ever had. One of the&s;e, under the title of <HI>Toyon,</HI> pre&s;ides over each o&s;trog, and is the referee in all differences; impo&s;es fines, and in|flicts puni&s;hments, for all crimes. This Toyon has the appointment of an officer, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and act under him.</P>
<P>By an edict of the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s, no crime what|ever can be puni&s;hed with death; but, in ca&s;es of mur|der, the puni&s;hment of the knout is inflicted, with &s;uch &s;everity, that the offender generally dies under it. The Greek religion is here introduced, and mi&s;&s;ion|aries &s;ettled.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="79">It is to this place, that many criminals are tran&s;ported, from different parts of the empire; and, without doubt, it is the mo&s;t horrid place of exile of all the va&s;t em|pire of Ru&s;&s;ia. Captain <HI>King</HI> met there with a cele|brated exile, the Ho&s;podin Iva&s;kin; a gentleman of a con&s;iderable family in Ru&s;&s;ia. His father was a general in the Empre&s;s's &s;ervice; and he, him&s;elf, having re|ceived his education partly in France, and partly in Germany, had been page to the empre&s;s Elizabeth, and an en&s;ign in her guards. At the age of 16 he was knouted, had his no&s;e &s;lit, and was bani&s;hed, fir&s;t to Siberia, and afterwards to Kamt&s;chatka, where he had now lived 31 years. He was a very tall, thin man, with a face furrowed all over with deep wrinkles, and bore, in his whole figure, the &s;tronge&s;t marks of old age, though he had &s;carcely reached his 54th year. No one ever knew the cau&s;e of his bani&s;hment; but they took it for granted, that it mu&s;t have been for &s;ome|thing very notorious, particularly as two or three go|vernors of Kamt&s;chatka have endeavoured to get him recalled, &s;ince the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s's reign; but, far from &s;ucceeding in this, they have not been able to get the place of his bani&s;hment changed. He told Captain <HI>King,</HI> that, for 20 years, he had not ta&s;ted bread, nor had been allowed &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of any kind whatever; but that, during this period, he had lived among the Kamt&s;chadales, on what his own activity, and toil, in the chace, had furni&s;hed; that, afterwards, he had a &s;mall pen&s;ion granted; and that, &s;ince Major <HI>Behm</HI> was
<PB N="77" REF="80">
governor, his &s;ituation had been mended: that he had procured his pen&s;ion to be encrea&s;ed to 100 rubles yearly, which is half the pay of an en&s;ign, in this place. This gentleman had forgotten both the French and German, &s;o totally, as not to under&s;tand what was &s;aid to him, in either of the&s;e languages.</P>
<P>The trade of this country, formerly, was confined to procuring the nece&s;&s;aries of life; bartering with the Koraiks for &s;ables, fox and white dog-&s;kins, for deer-&s;kins, cloaths, and other hides. It is a cu&s;tom here, among the natives, that, when one wants a thing an|other has, he goes freely to vi&s;it him, makes known his wants, and, though a &s;tranger, the other will ac|commodate him.</P>
<P>The commerce with the Ru&s;&s;ians, as far as con|cerns the exports, is entirely confined to furs, and car|ried on by a company of merchants, in&s;tituted by the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s. The&s;e are bought with money; &s;o that there is a great circulation of &s;pecie in the country. Articles of importation are, European manufactures, Engli&s;h, Dutch, Siberian, and Chine&s;e. They con&s;i&s;t of coar&s;e woollen and linen cloths, yarn &s;tockings, bon|nets, and gloves; thin Per&s;ian &s;ilks, cottons, Nankeens, &s;ilk and cotton handkerchiefs; bra&s;s, coppers, and pans; iron &s;toves, files, guns and gun-powder, hardware, &s;uch as hatchets, bills, knives, &amp;c. looking-gla&s;&s;es, flour, &s;ugar, leather boots, &amp;c. and the&s;e &s;ell for treble the
<PB N="78" REF="81">
price they might have been bought for in England: and, though the merchants have &s;o large a profit on the&s;e imported goods, they have &s;till a larger on the furs at Kiachta, on the frontiers of China, which is the great market for them. The be&s;t &s;ea-otter &s;kins &s;ell gene|rally in Kamt&s;chatka, for about 30 rubles each; a ruble about 4s. 6d. Engli&s;h. The Chine&s;e merchants at Kiachta purcha&s;e them at more than double that price, and &s;ell them again at Peking, at a great advance; where a farther, profitable trade is made with &s;ome of them, at Japan. If, therefore, a &s;kin is worth 30 ru|bles at Kamt&s;chatka, to be fir&s;t tran&s;ported to Okot&s;k, thence to be conveyed, by land, to Kiachta, a di&s;tance of 1,364 miles; thence on to Peking, 760 miles more; and, after this, to be tran&s;ported to Japan; what a prodigious advantageous trade might be carried on, between Kamt&s;chatka and Japan, which is but a fort|night's, or, at mo&s;t, three weeks &s;ail from it?</P>
<P>The duties ari&s;ing from the exports and imports, amount, annually, to about 10,000 rubles. There are &s;ix ve&s;&s;els, of 40 to 50 tons burthen, employed by the Empre&s;s, between Okot&s;k and Bolchere&s;k, two ports in Kamt&s;chatka, in tran&s;porting &s;tores and provi&s;ions. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are about 14 ve&s;&s;els, employed by the merchants in the fur-trade, among the Ea&s;tern i&s;lands, where the trade is chiefly carried on. Indeed, the whole &s;ea, between Kamt&s;chatka and America, is covered with i&s;lands.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE KORAIKS AND TSCHOUKTSCHES.</HEAD>
<P>THE Koraiks inhabit the northern coa&s;t of the gulph, Penchin&s;koi; and the mo&s;t northern part of Kamt&s;chatka, to the river Anadir. Their country extends, we&s;tward, from the river Olomon, to the Indian ocean. They are a nomade and &s;hepherd-peo|ple; and the country they wander over is rude, mar&s;hy, full of &s;mall rocks, and, in many places, de&s;titute of fore&s;ts.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e people are, however, &s;ettled, in the northern part of Kamt&s;chatka, on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, and have a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the Kamt&s;chadales. Their dre&s;s and habitations are of the &s;ame kind; they are tributary to the Ru&s;&s;ians, and are under the di&s;trict of the Ingiga. The Koraik women make lines upon their
<PB N="80" REF="83">
faces, as do the Tungu&s;e, live on the &s;ame kind of food as the Kamt&s;chadales, and dre&s;s it equally as na&s;tily.</P>
<P>The wandering Koraiks are employed wholly in breeding and pa&s;turing deer, of which they po&s;&s;e&s;s great numbers. A chief will have a herd of four or five thou&s;and. Their &s;ledges are drawn by rein-deer, not by dogs; nnd though, when not wanted, will pa&s;ture with others, yet, when called, will in&s;tantly quit the herd, and attend upon their ma&s;ter. The&s;e two nations of the Koraiks, &s;peak different dialects; but neither of them bear the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to the Kamt|&s;chadale.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this &s;avage people is enveloped in the thicke&s;t darkne&s;s, having no knowledge of it them|&s;elves; they are without the lea&s;t education, quite un|informed, and were not known before the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;ubdued them. There is nothing more probable, than that all the&s;e different nations are colonies from Ame|rica. Before the Ru&s;&s;ians came among them, riches alone conferred prerogative; but now they are under the &s;ame laws and regulations with other Siberians, pay their tribute in furs, but are not more numerous than the Kamt&s;chadales.</P>
<P>Hunting and fi&s;hing are the chief employ of the&s;e people; not &s;pending their time in the kitchen, as do

They keep their huts exceedingly hot, and the women, whil&s;t in them, go quite naked. They travel, in winter, in &s;ledges, &s;omething like the Laplanders, managing the deer with leather reins, to which is tied a comb, &s;o that, by pulling the rein, it pricks the neck of the rein-deer, and &s;purs him on. They &s;ometimes put two a-brea&s;t, and will travel 100 miles a-day. They never kill a deer, eating only &s;uch as die by accident, or di&s;|ea&s;e; and, to this, their numerous herds are owing.

are, &s;ays Captain <HI>King,</HI> a &s;tout, well-made, bold, war-like race of people, formidable neighbours to the Ko|raiks. The Ru&s;&s;ians have many years endeavoured to bring them under their dominion; and, after lo&s;ing a great many men in their different expeditions for this purpo&s;e, have not been able to effect it. As they lie in latitude 66&deg;, the climate is cold, the &s;oil mar&s;hy, abounding in rocks, barren, bare of woods, and ex|tremely wild and &s;avage. The &s;ummer la&s;ts only a few months; but, in this &s;ea&s;on, the days are very long, as, for &s;everal weeks, the &s;un does not &s;et at all. The winter extends through the greate&s;t part of the year; and, during this melancholy &s;ea&s;on, it is almo&s;t one continual night.

The hi&s;tory and &s;trength of this people is yet unknown; but, by a probable com|putation, they are e&s;timated at 3,500 males, capable of bearing arms. Captain <HI>Cook</HI> &s;ays, they are certainly a di&s;tinct nation from the Americans on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t; though the &s;treight that &s;eparates the two con|tinents, is but 13 leagues wide; for the Americans on that coa&s;t, at lea&s;t &s;uch as he had &s;een, were rather low of &s;tature, with round, chubby faces, and high cheek bones; whereas, the T&s;choukt&s;ches, on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of A&s;ia, have long vi&s;ages, and are &s;tout and well-made. Their dre&s;s (he &s;peaks only of the men) con&s;i&s;ts of a cap, a frock, a pair of breeches, a pair of

boots, and a pair of glove all made of well-dre&s;&s;ed leather, or the &s;kins of deer, dogs, or &s;eals; &s;ome with the hair, or fur on, others without it. Their caps are made to fit the head, very clo&s;e; and, over the&s;e caps, they wear hoods of dog-&s;kin, large enough to cover both head and &s;houlders. Their hair is black, but is cut clo&s;e to the head; and none have any beard.</P>
<P>Such as came down to the coa&s;t, when Captain <HI>Cook</HI> approached the &s;hore, were armed with bows and &s;pears, or &s;pontoons; and, as the la&s;t were of iron, or &s;teel, he is per&s;uaded, they were of European, or A&s;iatic workman&s;hip; and that they get them by trading with the Ru&s;&s;ians; the &s;taves of the&s;e &s;pears were carved, and inlaid with bra&s;s and white metal. Their arrows were pointed with bone, or &s;tone; &s;ome few of them had barbs.

<P><PB N="86" REF="89">We found the village, continues he, where we land|ed, compo&s;ed both of &s;ummer and winter-habitations; the latter are exactly like a vault, the floor of which is &s;unk a little below the &s;urface of the earth. One of them, which I examined, was of an oval form, about 20 feet long, and 12, or more, high. The framing was compo&s;ed of wood, and the ribs of whales, di&s;po&s;ed in a judicious manner, and bound together with &s;maller materials of the &s;ame kind. Over this framing, was laid a covering of &s;trong, coar&s;e gra&s;s, and that again covered with earth; &s;o that the out&s;ide of the hou&s;e looked like a little hillock, &s;upported by a &s;tone wall, three or four feet high, built round the two &s;ides, and at one end; and, at the other end, the earth is rai&s;ed, &s;loping, to walk up to the entrance, which is by a hole in the top of the roof, over the built end. The floor was boarded, and under it a kind of cellar, in which I &s;aw nothing but water; probably, the floor is &s;o contrived, to keep the hou&s;e dry, from the draining of the land. At the end of each hou&s;e, was a vaulted room, appa|rently a &s;tore-room, communicating with the hou&s;e, by a dark pa&s;&s;age, and, with the air, by a hole in the roof, which is on a level with the ground we walk on; but they cannot be &s;aid to be wholly under ground, as one reached to the edge of the hill, along which they were made, and which was built up with &s;tone.

<P><PB N="87" REF="90">Their &s;ummer-huts are pretty large and circular; be|ing brought to a point, at top. The framing is of &s;light poles, or bones, covered with the &s;kins of &s;ea-animals. In the in&s;ide, there is a fire-place, ju&s;t within the door; and, near this, lie generally &s;ome few, dirty ve&s;&s;els, made of wood, or leather. Their bed-places are clo&s;e to the &s;ide, and take up about half the circuit. Some privacy is probably ob&s;erved; as they have &s;everal partitions, made with &s;kins. Their bed and bedding are made of deer-&s;kins, and are generally very dry and clean.</P>
<P>About their habitations, are erected &s;everal &s;tages, ten or twelve feet high, compo&s;ed of fi&s;h-bones, in which they dry their fi&s;h, out of the reach of their dogs, of which they have a great many of the fox-kind, large, with long, &s;oft hair, like wool.

<P>They neither eat raw fle&s;h, nor fi&s;h, &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI> but dre&s;s their food by hanging it in the &s;moke. Sau&s;ages are their favourite di&s;h; which they dre&s;s, by &s;moking. They have numerous herds of rein-deer, but never milk the female, of cour&s;e, like the Koriaks, want butter and chee&s;e; nor will they kill a rein-deer, for food, without the utmo&s;t regret; but eat &s;uch as die naturally; game, of all kinds, &s;ea animals, whales ca&s;t on &s;hore

We never found the whole herd a&s;leep, &s;ome being always on the watch; the&s;e, on the approach of the boat would wake tho&s;e next them, and the alarm being thus gradually communicated, the whole herd would be awake pre|&s;ently. But they were &s;eldom in a hurry to get away, till after they had been once fired at; then they would tumble one over the other into the &s;ea, in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; and if we did not, at the fir&s;t di&s;charge, kill tho&s;e we fired at, we generally lo&s;t them, though mor|tally wounded.

The dam, when in the water, holds the young one between her fore-fins. This animal &s;eems to &s;hed its teeth, for the large&s;t and the olde&s;t of them had not tu&s;ks more than &s;ix inches in length.

<P>The&s;e animals are of the kind with tho&s;e Lord <HI>Mul|grave</HI> met with in his voyage to the north pole. Their fle&s;h is fi&s;hy; but infinitely &s;uperior to the &s;ea-hor&s;e. But, to return to the T&s;choukt&s;ches.</P>
<P>The manners and cu&s;toms of this people re&s;emble much tho&s;e of the i&s;landers of the&s;e latitudes. Several families often live together in the &s;ame pit, having their apartments &s;eparated by upright poles. The habitation is commonly full of &s;moke; and, is &s;o hot, that the women &s;it always, &s;tark naked, even in the coole&s;t part. Every divi&s;ion has its particular lamp of fi&s;h-oil, and a wick of mo&s;s. Their beds are only low benches, co|vered with furs; and they are, by con&s;titution; &s;o in|ured to the cold, that the flame of a lamp is always &s;ufficient to warm them in the open air. When they travel, they are drawn in &s;ledges, by rein-deer. Their canoes are made of the ribs of whales, covered with &s;eal-&s;kins; and, after the manner of the Greenlanders and E&s;quimaux, &s;it in them, as in a pur&s;e, drawn clo&s;e round their body. They are about 12 feet long, nar|row, and flat-bottomed.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="96">With re&s;pect to their ferocity, they are naturally as revengeful and dangerous, as the Tungu&s;e, their neigh|bours, are mild and gentle. Twenty T&s;choukt&s;ches never he&s;itate a moment about attacking 50 Koraiks; and, had it not been for the Ru&s;&s;ian forts, or o&s;trogs, the former would long ago have exterminated the whole Koraik nation; nay, the very o&s;trogs built in their neighbourhood, are in continual danger.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding their characteri&s;tic of ferocity and cruelty, they are very ho&s;pitable, not compelling their gue&s;ts, indeed, to gorge them&s;elves, but will kill a rein-deer for their entertainment, which they never do for them&s;elves. After the manner of the Koraiks, they offer to their gue&s;ts the mo&s;t inchanting beauties at their di&s;po&s;al, to make the night agreeable to them; and the&s;e fair ones never forget that charming piece of gal|lantry, of pre&s;enting a cup of their urine to &s;uch as ac|cept their favours.</P>
<P>Their manner of taking wives, of educating their children, their rejoicings, and their interments, are exactly the &s;ame as among the Koriaks. Like them, they are of the Schamane religion. Their ideas of virtue and vice are exceedingly confu&s;ed. It is held cri|minal to thieve, or murder, in a family, or race, to which a per&s;on belongs; but the&s;e crimes, committed el&s;ewhere, are not only allowed, but held honourable and glorious. They have a bad opinion of a young girl,
<PB N="93" REF="97">
who has never acquitted her&s;elf cleverly in &s;ome theft; and, without &s;uch te&s;timony of her dexterity and ad|dre&s;s, &s;he will &s;carcely find a hu&s;band: and robberies committed on the circumjacent families, are con&s;idered as heroic acts. They &s;wear to the truth of a thing in the name of the &s;un; and, when conquered by their enemies, give their prie&s;ts as ho&s;tages, and pledges of their obedience.</P>
<P>They live, in families, according to their races; but have no formal &s;uperior. They obey the mo&s;t wealthy and &s;agacious among them, pre&s;erving, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t perfect independence, and the right of following each his own particular inclination. They think little of death, bear the troubles in&s;eparable to human life, with great reluctance; of cour&s;e, are very indifferent as to exi&s;tence, and ready to terminate their &s;ufferings by &s;uicide; a circum&s;tance that has thrown great ob&s;tacles in the way of their &s;ubjection.</P>

the Kuriles. According to <HI>Spanberg,</HI> they are 22 in number, not reckoning the &s;mall ones. The mo&s;t northern is called Shoom&s;ka, and is not more three leagues from the continent. The next to the &s;outh, is called Paramou&s;ir; is much larger than Shoom&s;ka, and inhabited by its own natives; their ance&s;tors, ac|cording to a tradition among them, having come from an i&s;land rather more to the &s;outh, called Onecutan. Tho&s;e two i&s;lands were fir&s;t vi&s;ited by the Ru&s;&s;ians, in 1713, and then brought under &s;ubjection. The others in order are at pre&s;ent made tributary; and the pa&s;tor of Paratounca, in Kamt&s;chatka, is their mi&s;&s;ionary, and vi&s;its them once in three years. The mo&s;t &s;outhern i&s;land, is Nadeeg&s;da, and repre&s;ented by the Ru&s;&s;ians, who trade to it, as inhabited by a race of men remark|ably hairy, and who live in a &s;tate of entire independ|ence. <HI>Spanberg</HI> places this i&s;land in 43&deg; 50&prime;, N. lati|tude, and mentions his having watered here; and, that this watering-party brought off eight of the natives, of whom he relates the following circum&s;tances: That their bodies were covered all over with hair; that &s;ome of them had &s;ilver rings, pendant from their ears; that they wore a loo&s;e, &s;triped, &s;ilk gown, reaching to their ancles; that &s;eeing a live cock on deck, they fell on their knees before it; and, likewi&s;e, before the pre|&s;ents that were brought to them, clo&s;ing, and &s;tretch|ing forth their hands, and bowing their heads, at the &s;ame time, to the ground; and that, excepting the pe|culiarity of their hairine&s;s, they re&s;embled the other

Kurile i&s;landers, and &s;poke the &s;ame language. The journal of the &s;hip Ca&s;hicom, which fir&s;t di&s;covered this i&s;land, and called it Je&s;o, &s;peaks of the people being covered with hair. Such a man was, if I recol|lect right, exhibited &s;ome time &s;ince in London; but not from this part of the world.</P>
<P>A trade of barter is carried on between Matmai and the Kurile i&s;lands, in which, for furs, dried fi&s;h, and oil, they get &s;ilk, cotton, iron, and Japane&s;e articles of furniture. The inhabitants of as many of the i&s;lands as are under the dominion of Ru&s;&s;ia, are converted to chri&s;tianity; and, probably, the time is not very far di&s;tant, when a friendly and profitable intercour&s;e be|tween Kamt&s;chatka, and this whole chain of i&s;lands, will be brought about, which will open a communication with Japan it&s;elf; a very de&s;ireable and advantageous thing to the Ru&s;&s;iaas.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands are all mountainous; and, in &s;everal are volcanoes and hot-&s;prings, as in Kamt&s;chatka. On &s;ome of them are fore&s;ts, on others, none; but the climate of the whole is temperate. They &s;eem to have been formed by a chain of mountains, beginning at Kamt&s;chatka, and ending at Niphon, who&s;e vallies, being &s;unk into the &s;ea, have left their &s;ummits, above water, of various magnitudes. The neare&s;t to Kamt|&s;chatka, is Shoom&s;ka, only three leagues from it; and, the furthe&s;t i&s;land of the chain, called Matmai, is only
<PB N="96" REF="100">
eight leagues from Japan, and about the &s;ame di&s;tance from the we&s;tern continent of China.</P>
<P>The chief of the&s;e i&s;lands are inhabited, but many &s;mall ones are de&s;ert and uninhabited; and they differ in &s;ituation, and natural con&s;titution; the more north|ern ones have fore&s;ts of laryx and pines; the more &s;outhward, produce canes, bulru&s;hes, bamboos, vines, &amp;c. In &s;ome of them are bears, foxes, and <HI>jovis mu|&s;imon</HI> of <HI>Pallas.</HI> They are not very populous; for, all the i&s;lands, &s;ubject to Ru&s;&s;ia, in 1766, were enrolled at no more than 262 males. They are a friendly, ho&s;|pitable, generous, humane, race of people; excelling the Kamt&s;chadales, not le&s;s in the formation of their bodies, than in the docility and quickne&s;s of their un|der&s;tandings. Their language is agreeable to the ear, and they &s;peak and pronounce it &s;lowly. Their habi|tations are dug in the earth, like the Kamt&s;chadales, only neater; are wain&s;coted and furni&s;hed with Japan goods. Their food con&s;i&s;ts of amphibious and &s;ea-animals, and all kinds of game, fowls, fi&s;h, fruits, wild roots, and &s;ea-cabbages, a &s;pecies of the <HI>fuci,</HI> and al&s;o &s;weetmeats from Japan.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the northern i&s;landers re&s;embles that of the Tungu&s;e. It is made of &s;wan-&s;kin, and other aqua|tic fowls. They cut their hair clo&s;e to the head, and wear hats, woven of reeds. The &s;outhern Kurilians love a thick beard, let their hair grow, and &s;tain their
<PB N="97" REF="101">
lips black. The&s;e dre&s;s like the Chine&s;e, and wear a Japan fabre, &s;lung in a girdle over their robe; but wear no breeches. The women dre&s;s like the men, but &s;tain their lips blacker, and mark their faces, hands and arms, with black figures. Fond of foreign fa&s;hions, they adopt them, and mix them with their more natural dre&s;s. Priding them&s;elves in a variety of colours, they get their cloaths from Japan; but are very dirty and &s;lovenly.</P>
<P>Their manner of taking a wife, is much like that of the Kamt&s;chadales. The lover does all he can to ob|tain the la&s;t favour; this done, he carries her off. If &s;he proves unfaithful, the hu&s;band challenges the gallant; and, in their duels, each &s;trikes his anta|goni&s;t three blows, by turns. The women have diffi|cult labours; the midwife names the child, without ceremony. The &s;outhern i&s;lands bury their dead; but the northern ones, cover &s;uch as die, in the winter, with &s;traw, and leave them. They have a particular veneration for old men; and, when any i&s;landers make a vi&s;it to &s;ome neighbouring i&s;le, the inhabitants take up their arms, and dre&s;s to receive them. They treat them like friends; &s;alute them, by bending the knee, embrace, and ki&s;s. Some of them have &s;o much &s;en|&s;ibility, at the&s;e friendly interviews, as to &s;hed tears. After the fir&s;t &s;alutations, the olde&s;t in company makes a &s;peech, in which he relates his adventures, and what has happened to him, and his friend, &s;ince the la&s;t vi&s;it;
<PB N="98" REF="102">
all the company &s;tanding up, during the recital, and li&s;tening with the profounde&s;t attention. This orator having fini&s;hed, he to whom the vi&s;it is paid, makes a &s;peech in his turn, and every one declares he is much intere&s;ted in all that hath happened to the re&s;t. After the&s;e a&s;&s;urances of reciprocal friend&s;hip, an entertain|ment takes place, but filthy enough; they &s;ing, dance, and tell tales. Their expre&s;&s;ions are tender, mode&s;t, and becoming; and, as they hate lies and fraud, they always &s;peak the truth, with the utmo&s;t fidelity.</P>

<P>AMERICA, we have ob&s;erved, is &s;eparated from the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Siberia, and continent of A&s;ia, by a &s;treight; in which are many i&s;lands, of various mag|nitude; the&s;e al&s;o are under the dominion of Ru&s;&s;ia.

<P><PB N="99" REF="104">The&s;e i&s;lands are &s;uppo&s;ed to extend from the penin|&s;ula of Kamt&s;chatka, to the continent of America, in the direction we&s;t &s;outh-we&s;t, to ea&s;t north-ea&s;t, from about 56 degrees north latitude to 61; one of the large&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands, is Koumandir&s;koi, lying about 63 leagues ea&s;t of the mouth of the river Kamt&s;chatka; and is about 60 miles in length. The land Oumnakis about 63 leagues in circuit, and Ounala&s;hka, is larger than this.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e i&s;lands are &s;o near the coa&s;t of Siberia, that the T&s;choukt&s;ches venture over in their little ca|noes; and the neare&s;t, to the American coa&s;t, is &s;up|po&s;ed to be the i&s;land of Kadyak. All the&s;e i&s;lands are alike, with re&s;pect to &s;oil: they are &s;tony, mountain|ous, boggy, wild, and uncultivated. In their produce they differ, according to their &s;ituation and climate. Some are covered with fore&s;ts, and abound with fore&s;t-game. The more &s;outhern are bare of wood; but abound in foxes, and other animals, that love an open country. The &s;ea-otter, <HI>Mu&s;tela Lutris,</HI> &s;ea-lion, <HI>Phoca Leonina,</HI> &s;ea-bear, <HI>Phoca Ur&s;ina,</HI> &s;eals, and other amphi|bious animals, are found on their &s;hores; and the &s;ea throws up &s;ea-cabbages, mu&s;cles, a variety of &s;hell-fi&s;h, and a quantity of floating timber.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e i&s;lands are inhabited, others not; and tho&s;e which are, but thinly; &s;ome having but two or three families, and &s;ome not exceeding 100. The
<PB N="100" REF="105">
Ru&s;&s;ians have no &s;ettlement on any of them; but, in 1766, enrolled the inhabitants of all they vi&s;ited, and could make no more than 367 tributary-males in the whole.</P>
<P>Two Ru&s;&s;ian ve&s;&s;els make the voyage of &s;ome of the&s;e i&s;lands once a year, and collect a tribute from all they vi&s;it. The different i&s;landers &s;eem to be about as much di&s;tingui&s;hable from each other, as the different Tartar tribes in Siberia; and their language varys but little. The natives of Kadiak, call them&s;elves <HI>Kana|guil,</HI> not unlike <HI>Karalit,</HI> the name of the Greenlanders, and the E&s;quimaux Indians.</P>
<P>Of Ounala&s;kka, we &s;hall &s;peak more particularly.&mdash; The inhabitants of the&s;e i&s;lands, in general, are &s;tout and robu&s;t, but active. Their faces are flat, and their &s;kins fair. They have lank, black hair, and but little beard. They have a good &s;hare of plain, natural un|der&s;tanding; and their children learn foreign languages with great facility. They &s;eem cold and indifferent in all their actions; but, rou&s;e them, and they are fu|rious and revengful, without any regard to con&s;equences. The lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion, drives them to de&s;pair; and, the lea&s;t affliction, to &s;elf-murder. Though free and independent, they are neither fraudulent nor perfidious. They will offer their wives to tho&s;e who behave friendly to them; but, whoever &s;hall pre&s;ume to offer violence to a woman, is &s;ure to pay the forfeit of his life.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="106">There is &s;uch a perfect equality among them, that they have no chief, or &s;uperior, nor any law, or pu|ni&s;hment. They enjoy life, without any bitter recol|lection of the pa&s;t, or any anxious &s;olicitude for the future. They live in a &s;ociety of families, called a race, mutually defending each other. If &s;trangers, of a neigh|bouring i&s;le, come to vi&s;it them in &s;mall companies, they are amicably received; but, if in larger bands, they are repul&s;ed with arms, the inhabitants of the &s;ame i&s;land con&s;idering that i&s;land as their own. They have no knowledge of letters, are ignorant of their own hi&s;tory, totally void of education, or any kind of infor|mation, but what immediately re&s;pects their way of life. To give a &s;pecimen of their language: <HI>Aga&iuml;ya,</HI> &s;ig|nifies the &s;un; <HI>Touguilag,</HI> the moon; <HI>Tana,</HI> the water; <HI>Kat&s;chik,</HI> the wind; <HI>Kiguenag,</HI> fire; <HI>Ta&iuml;yagha,</HI> man; <HI>Ayagout,</HI> woman; <HI>Yaga,</HI> wood.</P>
<P>They have no connexion with any i&s;land but their own; and have no dome&s;tic animals, not even dogs. Game they kill with &s;nares and arrows, and fi&s;h, by inclo&s;ing parts of rivers, and catching it in ba&s;kets. The women are employed in this bu&s;ine&s;s, equally with the men, and partake of all their labours. The Sibe|rian women &s;urpa&s;s the&s;e in tanning; but the&s;e &s;urpa&s;s the Siberians in embroidery. They dre&s;s in furs; and &s;ince the arrival of the Ru&s;&s;ians among them, wear the wor&s;t, and barter away the be&s;t, for &s;hreds and remnants of cloth, thread, needles, beads, and other trifles.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="107">The&s;e happy people are &s;o contented with their lot, that the ma&s;ter of a tolerably good pit, thinks him&s;elf the fir&s;t man in the world, provided he has a good number of women, a &s;trong canoe, and &s;uch cloaths as would be con&s;idered as hand&s;ome in no other place. Yet the&s;e haughty i&s;landers do not po&s;&s;e&s;s the lea&s;t ar|ticle, that would have any value with an European; nay, they &s;carce enjoy &s;o much authority, as to make their children, in the lea&s;t, obedient.</P>
<P>Their arms and moveables are a perfect picture of the infancy of the world. The bow and arrow, the dart, the lance, and the &s;ling, the club, and the &s;hield, are all their weapons; and they can throw a javelin, three feet long, to the di&s;tance of 30 fathoms, equal to a Greenlander.</P>
<P>Their <HI>baidars,</HI> or boats, are &s;everal fathoms long, and will carry from five to 40 per&s;ons. They are badly made, and with much trouble, being con&s;tructed of floating timber, hewn with &s;harp &s;tones, or of the ribs of a whale, covered with &s;ea-hor&s;e &s;kin. Their com|mon canoes hold no more than two per&s;ons, and &s;el|dom weigh more than about 25lb.</P>
<P>Their habitations are like the Kamt&s;chadales, only larger. Their beds are mats, or furs; and they light their pits with lamps, &s;u&s;pended from the roof. A whole village, or &s;everal families, will live in a &s;ingle pit, to

the number of from 50 to 300 per&s;ons; and a &s;tranger, fir&s;t entering them, by a hole in the roof, mu&s;t con|ceive he is de&s;cending into hell. A gloomy darkne&s;s, a thick &s;moke, a heat, often in&s;upportable; the pale light of &s;tinking tapers, a number of beings, all wild and naked, having nothing human but the figure; a great abundance of vermin; food, the mo&s;t mi&s;erable and di&s;gu&s;tful, a con&s;tant noi&s;e and din, a horrible &s;tench, wor&s;e than that of Styx. All the&s;e together form the picture pre&s;ented to a &s;tranger de&s;cending into the&s;e &s;ubterranean caverns: but they have &s;ummer-huts al&s;o, like the Kamt&s;chatdales, abounding al&s;o with inhabitants. Many of them pa&s;s their whole life in holes of rocks, or in natural caverns which they find.</P>
<P>Their furniture is as &s;imple as their hou&s;es; troughs, made of drift wood, &s;hells, hollowed &s;tones, ba&s;kets, bark and leather-ve&s;&s;els, &s;traw mats, &s;harp &s;tone-hatchets and knives, uten&s;ils of bone; and, where the Ru&s;&s;ians u&s;ually land, &s;ome few &s;killets and boilers.</P>
<P>Per&s;uaded that Nature never meant to conceal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir &s;hape, they go always naked within their huts, as well adults as children. Indeed their huts are kept &s;o hot, that dre&s;s would be burthen&s;ome. In this ea&s;y negli|gence the two &s;exes conver&s;e together; and whenever they are abroad, they throw of all their dre&s;s as &s;oon as it becomes inconvenient. Some, however, wear a
<PB N="104" REF="109">
fur, or leather-apron; and many, like our forefathers, hide their nakedne&s;s only with a leaf; not &s;o much for decency, as &s;ecurity again&s;t injury.</P>
<P>In many of the i&s;les, both &s;exes ornament their faces, arms and hands, by &s;taining them, with the figures of birds, bea&s;ts and flowers; by pricking the &s;kin till it bleeds, and rubbing the part with a black powder. Many bore their ears with a number of holes, through which pa&s;s gaudy feathers, &s;trings of beads, and other ornaments. As a great quantity of hair is by them e&s;teemed ugly, the men pluck out the greate&s;t part of their beards by the roots; the women cut their hair before, and tie up the re&s;t, on the crown, in a tre&s;s. Some men &s;have their heads clo&s;e, with &s;harp &s;tones, and others leave a round ton&s;ure. The gene|rality are &s;o filthy, as never to wa&s;h them&s;elves; and, with their na&s;tine&s;s, and copper complexion, are truly ugly. Tho&s;e who do wa&s;h, wa&s;h with their own water, and then with &s;pring-water; and the&s;e have a good &s;kin, and look fre&s;h and well. Both men and women, throughout the i&s;les, make two deep inci&s;ions, when young, in the lower lip, and a hole in the cartilaginous &s;eparation of the no&s;trils; and, when they mean to dre&s;s, fix, in the&s;e inci&s;ions in the lip, two &s;lender teeth, turned upwards, and &s;moothly poli&s;hed, about two inches long; through the hole in their no&s;e, they pa&s;s a little bone of a bird, in order to &s;well out the no&s;trils. Some, that wi&s;h to be &s;marter than ordi|nary,
<PB N="105" REF="110">
will make a third inci&s;ion in the lip, and fix &s;ome coloured &s;tone in it.</P>
<P>When they wear a dre&s;s, it is a frock, like that of the Koraiks, reaching to the knees, made of the belly-&s;kin of various water-fowl. Tho&s;e of the women are made of &s;kins, with the fur inwards, and worn next the &s;kin, the out&s;ide &s;tained with a red earth; and this is all their dre&s;s, except, in &s;ummer, they will &s;ometimes wear a wooden hat, &s;cooped out in the &s;hape of a duck's beak, about 18 inches long, from the fore part to the hind; the&s;e they paint with coloured earths, decorate the edges with feathers, the crown with a bunch of &s;ea-lion's hair, eight or ten inches long, and &s;urround them with gla&s;s, lead, and bunches of feathers, &s;o as to re|&s;emble a Roman helmet. Some on the top place an image of a man &s;itting, about an inch high, tolerably well covered in &s;tone. Other i&s;landers wear conical caps, made of &s;kin, and embroidered, with broad fringes of hair, and the &s;ides and borders ornamented with feathers, and embroidered with the &s;inews of animals, hair, and gla&s;s beads, which they get from the Ru&s;&s;ians. Others will &s;kin a water-fowl, in &s;uch a manner, that the neck, wings and tail, &s;hall remain with the &s;kin; and, in drying them, keep the head and neck erect, and the whole in a good &s;hape, and put their head into the body of the bird: the&s;e caps are worn by women, and are the hand&s;ome&s;t part of their dre&s;s. They vary the&s;e caps in a number of ways, but all equally orna|mented.
<PB N="106" REF="111">
Their be&s;t garments are made of the belly-&s;kins of different fowls, &s;haped like &s;hifts, and reaching to their heels; the borders prettily embroidered, two inches broad; and, a quantity of &s;tripes of fine furs, &s;ix or eight inches long, tied all round it; at bottom, there is a furbelow, &s;ix inches broad, made of a number of &s;trait &s;lips of &s;kin.</P>
<P>Their food is agreeable to what the i&s;lands produce. They eat whales, &s;ea-hor&s;es, porpoi&s;es, &s;ea-otters, &s;ea-bears, &s;ea-lions, bea&s;ts of prey, and other game; all &s;orts of fowl, birds of prey, and others, and all kind of fi&s;h; in &s;hort, except in&s;ects, and their fellow-creatures, nothing comes ami&s;s to them, either in the animal or vegetable kingdom; and they will eat them half-rot|ten. Salt is unknown to them. Generally &s;peaking, they eat all their food raw; &s;o that, the blood of the fle&s;h they devour, runs out of their mouths, through the inci&s;ions in the lower lip. What they <HI>do</HI> dre&s;s, is either warmed in the flame of their &s;tinking lamps, by &s;tick|ing it on large &s;kewers, and turning it round in that flame; or, by &s;tewing it between two &s;tones, hollowed out for a pan and its cover; the joints being cemented with clay; after thus dre&s;&s;ing it, they &s;et it by till it is cold. Their drink is water; and, if they have not fre&s;h at hand, they will drink &s;ea-water. As a treat, they will gulp down the blubber of whales, porpoi&s;es, or other fi&s;h. They are not fond of &s;pirituous liquors; but, from the Ru&s;&s;ians, many of them have learnt to take &s;nuff.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="112">Every family or village has a certain extent of &s;ea-coa&s;t appropriated to their &s;ole u&s;e, from which they collect for food any fi&s;h, or dead animals that may be ca&s;t a&s;hore; nor does any &s;tranger pre&s;ume to invade this territory; if he does, he is in danger of being &s;hot, or knocked on the head.</P>
<P>Simple and natural as the life of the&s;e i&s;landers is, it does no great credit to the &s;tate of nature, as the na|tives are but a &s;mall degree above the level of the brute creation. They are of a &s;erious turn, very laco|nic in their conver&s;ation, rude, and uncivilized; but at the &s;ame time, from carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, generous and ho&s;pita|ble. They have no id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of &s;ubordination or decorum, but every one follows his own propen&s;ities; eating when they are hungry, and even performing the evacuations of nature whil&s;t they are eating. Children almo&s;t fill the pit, in which they live with their ordure; and grown per&s;ons &s;eldom go further than the roof; of cour&s;e the &s;tench is intolerable. In times of &s;carcity they will fa&s;t &s;everal days together. At home they go quite naked, practi&s;e propagation as their inclination leads them, whether in public or out, without any re|&s;erve; and the women are delivered in the pre&s;ence of any one that may chance to be with them, without the lea&s;t privacy. Their beds are mats, and their cloaths are their only covering.</P>
<P>Their matrimonial connexions &s;carce de&s;erve the name of marriage. A boy, old enough to hunt or
<PB N="108" REF="113">
catch fi&s;h, takes home one or two girls or women, and they live together in the &s;ame pit, without any previ|ous contract. A man generally &s;elects his fir&s;t wives him&s;elf; but if he is a &s;tout fellow, and a good hunt&s;|man or fi&s;herman, maidens, de&s;erted women, widows, and wives di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from their hu&s;bands, will offer them&s;elves to them; &s;o that many will have four, five, or &s;ix wives. Where a hou&s;ehold has been thus form|ed, there is generally a gang of old men, women, and children. All are welcome, and employed according to their &s;trength; but when times are not pro&s;perous with &s;uch a family, they di&s;per&s;e as ea&s;ily as they form. The men go to &s;eek provi&s;ions el&s;ewhere; women take to other men, and carry their children with them; and this without di&s;order or di&s;pute; for the women are as independent and free as the men. Men will &s;ometimes truck away their wives and children; and &s;uch wives and children will &s;ometimes return to their original home: and in this pure &s;tate of nature, we &s;ee fewer di&s;agreeable con&s;equences than under more regular in|&s;titutions.</P>
<P>Ignorant of the exclu&s;ive right of a married &s;tate, the&s;e i&s;landers know no jealou&s;y, but leave their wives in a perfect freedom of promi&s;cuous intercour&s;e with other men. As they engage in wedlock with no other motive than to have an a&s;&s;i&s;tance in gaining a liveli|hood, they are not &s;ubject to exce&s;&s;ive libertini&s;m. They neither envy any man's plea&s;ure, or good for|tune;
<PB N="109" REF="114">
and, as buxom women are preferred to maidens, girls are &s;uffered to grow up in perfect liberty, totally uncon&s;trained by either virtue or mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>Women have ea&s;y labours; frequently bathe their children in cold &s;ea-water; and, whenever a child cries, it is plunged under water, even in the colde&s;t weather, till it is &s;ilent. They &s;uckle their infants but a &s;hort time, feeding them with raw and gro&s;s meat; and, to make them &s;quat down on their heels, often tie their feet together, and place them in that at|titude.</P>
<P>But, &s;avage as they are, they are not in&s;en&s;ible, but will &s;eek to &s;often the rubs of life by various amu&s;e|ments. They make no fe&s;tivals either at their nup|tials, the birth of their children, or their religious exer|ci&s;es; yet they pa&s;s the whole month of December in vi&s;iting, not only their neighbours, but the adjacent i&s;les. A &s;ucce&s;sful chace, a vi&s;it from an unexpected friend, or the carca&s;e of a whale thrown on the coa&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> will cau&s;e a rejoicing. On this latter occa&s;ion, that of a whale being ca&s;t a&s;hore, it becomes the property of the whole i&s;land; the people a&s;&s;emble from all parts, expre&s;s the mo&s;t extravagant joy, perform idolatrous wor&s;hip round the animal; then &s;trip them&s;elves naked, and proceed to cut up and divide the prey. This done, they put on their be&s;t cloaths, &s;well out their no&s;trils, decorate their lips with crooked bones, and devour all
<PB N="110" REF="115">
the parts that are eatable with demon&s;trations of ex|ce&s;&s;ive tran&s;port. At the&s;e celebrations they beat a kind of kettle drum, &s;ing, dance, tell &s;tories, and indulge their amorous propen&s;ities. This drum is the only mu&s;ical in&s;trument they have; and they dance, and beat it in proce&s;&s;ion before their vi&s;itors. Their dances are regular, but backwards and forwards; &s;everal per&s;ons make a long &s;tring, and perform a number of leaps and ge&s;ticulations. They have at this time al&s;o ma&s;|querades, concealing their faces with wooden ma&s;ks, repre&s;enting the form of various animals. The men attend the&s;e quite naked, except a &s;mall apron or pur&s;e worn before; but the women ate cloathed. Having danced enough, they break their drums and ma&s;ks; couches are then brought, the women are courted, and the ho&s;t of the entertainment furni&s;hes &s;uch of his gue&s;ts with ladies as brought none with them. When their vi&s;itors are leaving them, the parting is cold; the ho&s;t neither conducting them on their way, nor the gue&s;ts expre&s;&s;ing any thanks for the kind reception they have met with.</P>
<P>They are pagans, and their faith is Schamani&s;m, as is indeed that of all the Ea&s;tern Siberians; though le&s;s &s;en&s;ual than the&s;e i&s;landers. They have no di&s;tinct idea of gods, their influence on mankind, nor of a fu|ture &s;tate. They have neither fe&s;tivals, nor any de|gree of wor&s;hip. Their magic prie&s;ts are like tho&s;e of Kamt&s;chatka,, who pretend to be related to, and con|nected
<PB N="111" REF="116">
with &s;pirits, and boa&s;t of knowing the pa&s;t and the future.</P>
<P>Like other Schamanders, they inter with the dead &s;undry uten&s;ils, to enable them to begin the other world with. They &s;uppo&s;e the volcanoes, the &s;moking rocks of their i&s;land, and &s;undry great caverns, to be the abode of their &s;pirits, and to the&s;e objects their prayers are addre&s;&s;ed; but they have in their habita|tions certain &s;mall idols, which they rub with blood and grea&s;e, as their food. They are terrified at gho&s;ts and &s;pectres; and it is with great reluctance that they inhabit the huts of any decea&s;ed per&s;on; of cour&s;e, left &s;uch huts &s;hould be u&s;ele&s;s, they carry the &s;ick out of them, and &s;uffer them to die in the open air. They bury their poor in their cloaths, wrapping them up in mat, with certain uten&s;ils and implements of hunting; but the rich they dre&s;s in their be&s;t garments, place them in a little canoe, hang it to a kind of gallows, and thus &s;uffer it to rot in the air.</P>
<P>They have generally a good con&s;titution, and pre|&s;erve it to a very advanced age. The &s;mall-pox is un|known to them; and the &s;curvy, itch, fevers, and many other di&s;tempers, are &s;eldom met with. Their teeth continue firm and white even to old age; and if any one finds him&s;elf unwell, he keeps a perfect regi|men for a few days, and is perfectly recovered. For the head-ach they open a vein in the head with a &s;harp
<PB N="112" REF="117">
flint, and dre&s;s their wounds with healing herbs, which their country affords. They have little fear of pain; and as they make glue by a preparation of the blood of animals, if they have no &s;uch blood at hand, they will, without he&s;itation, &s;trike them&s;elves on the no&s;e with their fi&s;t, and attain from them&s;elves as much as they have occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ian troops and merchants, Co&s;&s;acks, and others, who frequent the&s;e i&s;lands, lead but a trouble|&s;ome life. They embark at Kamt&s;chat&s;ka, vi&s;it differ|ent places, and &s;eldom perform the voyage in le&s;s than a year. At the&s;e times they receive the tribute, bar|ter with the natives a variety of &s;mall merchandize, beads, and trinkets for furs. The Ru&s;&s;ians them&s;elves are &s;uffered to hunt when there, and the Tartars will attend them on the occa&s;ion. The Ru&s;&s;ians have their own barracks on &s;hore; never lodge with the natives, nor tru&s;t them&s;elves alone with them; for though the i&s;landers generally treat them with curte&s;y, yet, if any &s;u&s;picion is broad, they re&s;olve on de&s;troying every fo|reigner, and that without reflection.</P>
<P><HI>Oonalah&s;ka.</HI>&mdash;Of all the groupes of i&s;lands in the north-&s;ea, that, of which Oonalah&s;ka is one, is by far the great|e&s;t, and this i&s;land the principal of them all. This group extends 40 leagues from Oonalah&s;ka to F. N. F. The Ru&s;&s;ians have a &s;ettlement on this i&s;land, which at pre&s;ent con&s;i&s;ts only of a dwelling-hou&s;e and two &s;tore-hou&s;es. Be&s;ides the Ru&s;&s;ians re&s;ident here, are a
<PB N="113" REF="118">
number of Kamt&s;chadales; and &s;ome of the natives, as &s;ervants, or &s;laves, to the former. The&s;e all live in the &s;ame hou&s;e; the Ru&s;&s;ians at the upper end, the Kamt&s;chadales in the middle, and the natives at the lower end; where is fixed a large boiler for preparing their food, which con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of what the &s;ea pro|duces, with the addition of wild roots and berries. There are Ru&s;&s;ians &s;ettled on all the principal i&s;lands, between Oonala&s;hka and Kamt&s;chatka, for the &s;ole pur|po&s;e of collecting furs. Their great object is the &s;ea-beaver, or otter: they have frequented Oonala&s;hka, &s;ince the year 1762. The latitude of Samganoodka, the principal haven of Oonala&s;hka, and where Captain <HI>Cooke</HI> lay, in October, 1778, is 53&deg; 5 min. N. the lon|gitude, 193&deg; 30 min. W.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians here &s;ettled, are obliged to put up with the food of the country; but Captain <HI>Cooke</HI> &s;ays, he got &s;ome whale's fle&s;h of their dre&s;&s;ing, and it was very palatable; and they treated him with a kind of pan-pudding, made of &s;almon-roe, beat up very fine, and fried, which is a good &s;uccedaneum for bread, which they &s;eldom can procure. As to liquor they have none, but the juice of berries, which they &s;ip at meals. As the i&s;land &s;upplies them with food, &s;o does it with clothes, which con&s;i&s;t chiefly of &s;kins. Their upper garment is made like our waggoner's frock, and reaches to their knees. Be&s;ides this, they wear a wai&s;tcoat, or two, a pair of breeches, a fur cap, and a pair of boots,
<PB N="114" REF="119">
the &s;oles and upper leathers of which, are made of Ru&s;&s;ian leather, but the legs of &s;trong gut.</P>
<P>The natives are, to all appearance, peaceable and in|offen&s;ive, and hone&s;t to the extreme; perhaps, made &s;o from &s;trict di&s;cipline. They have their own chiefs on each i&s;land, and &s;eem to enjoy liberty and property unmole&s;ted. They are low of &s;tature, but plump and well-&s;haped, with &s;hort necks, chubby faces, black eyes, &s;mall hands, and long, &s;trait, black hair, which the men wear loo&s;e behind, and cut before; but the women tie up in a bunch.</P>
<P>Both &s;exes wear the &s;ame kind of cloaths; the differ|ence is only in the materials. The woman's frock is made of &s;eal-&s;kin, like a carter's frock; that of the men, is made of the &s;kin of birds: both reach below the knee. This is the whole dre&s;s of the women: but the men wear, over their frock, another, made of gut, which repels water, and has a hood over it, that draws over the head. Some wear boots; and, all of them, a kind of oval-&s;nouted cap, made of wood, with a rim, to admit the head. The&s;e caps are dyed with green, and other colours; and, round the upper part of the rim, are &s;tuck the long bri&s;tles of &s;ome &s;ea-animal: on which are &s;trung gla&s;s beads; and, in the front, is a &s;mall image, or two, made of bone.</P>
<P><PB REF="120"><FIGURE>

<P><PB N="115" REF="121">They u&s;e no paint; but, the women puncture their faces &s;lightly; and, both men and women, bore the under lip, in which they fix pieces of &s;tone. At Oonala&s;hka, indeed, it is an ornament only u&s;ed by the women. Some fix beads to the upper lip; and, all of them, hang ornaments in their ears.</P>
<P>Their food con&s;i&s;ts of fi&s;h, &s;ea-animals, birds, roots, berries, and &s;ea-weeds. They dry large quantities of fi&s;h in &s;ummer; which they lay up, in &s;mall huts, for winter-u&s;e; and, probably, they pre&s;erve roots and berries for the &s;ame time of &s;carcity. Every thing is eaten almo&s;t raw: boiling and roa&s;ting are their only means of cookery. Some have got little bra&s;s kettles; and, tho&s;e who have not, make one of a flat &s;tone, with &s;ides of clay, not unlike a rai&s;ed pye. I was once pre|&s;ent, &s;ays Captain <HI>Cooke,</HI> when the chief of Oonala&s;hka made his dinner of the raw head of a large halibut, ju&s;t caught. Before any was given to the chief, two of his &s;ervants eat the gills, without any other preparation than &s;queezing out the &s;lime. This done, one of them cut off the head of the fi&s;h, took it to the &s;ea, and wa&s;hed it, then came with it, and &s;at down by the chief; fir&s;t pulling up &s;ome gra&s;s, upon a part of which the head was laid, and the re&s;t was &s;trewed before the chief. He then cut large pieces of the cheeks, and laid the&s;e within the reach of the great man, who &s;wallowed them with as much &s;atisfaction as we &s;hould do raw oy&s;ters. When he had done, the remains of the head were cut
<PB N="116" REF="122">
in pieces, and given to the attendants, who tore off the meat with their teeth, and gnawed the bones, like &s;o many dogs.</P>
<P>As the&s;e people u&s;e no paint, they are not &s;o dirty in their per&s;ons as the &s;avages that do; but they are equally lou&s;y, and filthy in their hou&s;es. They live in a pit, as do the Kamt&s;chadales; generally an oblong &s;quare, about 50 feet by 20. Over this pit is rai&s;ed a wooden roof, fir&s;t covered with gra&s;s, and then with earth; &s;o that, without, it has the appearance of a dunghill. In the middle of this roof, towards each end, is left a &s;quare hole; one to admit the light, and the other for an entrance; as, by this hole, they de&s;cend into the hut by a po&s;t, with &s;teps into it. Round the &s;ides and ends of the huts, the families (for &s;everal lodge in one hou&s;e) have their &s;eparate apartments, where they &s;leep, and &s;it at work, not on benches, but in a kind of concave trench, dug all round the in&s;ide, and covered with mats; &s;o, that this part is kept tolerably decent, but the middle of the hut, common to all, is far otherwi&s;e. For, although it is covered with dry gra&s;s, it is a rece&s;s liable for all kinds of filth; and the place for the urine-trough, the &s;tench of which is not mended, by raw hides, or leather, being con&s;tantly &s;teeped in it. Behind, and over the trench, are placed the few effects they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; &s;uch as their cloaths, mats, and &s;kins.</P>
<P><PB REF="123"><FIGURE>

<P><PB N="117" REF="124">Their furniture con&s;i&s;ts of bowls, &s;poons, buckets, cans, matted ba&s;kets, and, perhaps, a Ru&s;&s;ian kettle, or pot. All the&s;e uten&s;ils are very neatly made, and well formed; and, yet they have no other tools, than a &s;mall piece of iron, fitted into a crooked, wooden handle, re&s;embling an adze, and a knife. There are few, if any of them, that do not take &s;nuff, chew and &s;moke tobacco&mdash;a luxury that bids fair to keep them poor.</P>
<P>They did not &s;eem, continues Captain <HI>Cooke,</HI> to covet any other iron in&s;truments than needles to &s;ew their canoes, and make and embroider their clothes. For thread, they u&s;e the &s;inews of animals. They are ex|cellent makers of ba&s;kets and mats, which are not only beautiful, but &s;trong; in &s;hort, there is &s;uch a neat|ne&s;s and perfection in mo&s;t of their workman&s;hip, that &s;hews, they neither want ingenuity, or per|&s;everance.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es are lighted, and heated, by lamps; having no fire-places. The&s;e lamps are made of a flat &s;tone, hollowed out like a plate, about the &s;ize of one, filled with oil, and the wick is a piece of dried gra&s;s; over the&s;e, they occa&s;ionally &s;it, and warm them&s;elves. Fire is produced, both by colli&s;ion and attrition; the former, by &s;triking two &s;tones again&s;t each other, on one of which brim&s;tone is rubbed; the other, by two
<PB N="118" REF="125">
pieces of wood, as among the Kamt&s;chadales, Green|landers, and E&s;kimaux Indians.</P>
<P>No &s;uch thing as a weapon is to be &s;een among them; having, probably, been di&s;armed by the Ru&s;|&s;ians: nor have they any large canoes; probably, like|wi&s;e, a political prohibition. Their canoes are built after the manner of the Greenlanders: they are about 12 feet long, a foot and a half broad in the middle, and 12 or 14 inches deep. They will occa&s;ionally carry two per&s;ons, one of whom is &s;tretched at full length in the canoe, and the other &s;its in the &s;eat, or round hole, which is nearly in the middle. Round this hole, is a rim, or hoop of wood, about which is &s;ewed gut-&s;kin, that can be drawn together, or opened, like a pur&s;e. The man &s;eats him&s;elf in this place, draws the &s;kin tight round his body, over his gut-frock, and brings the ends of the pur&s;e-&s;kin over the &s;houlder, to keep it in its place. The &s;leeves of his frock are tied round his wri&s;t; and, it being clo&s;e round his neck, and the hood drawn over his head, and the&s;e confined by his cap, the water can &s;carcely penetrate either to his body, or into the canoe: if it &s;hould, it is taken out of the canoe with a &s;ponge. They will put their canoes on, at the rate of &s;even miles an hour, by &s;triking the water with a quick, regular motion, on each &s;ide the canoe, with a double-bladed paddle, which they hold, with both hands, in the middle.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="126">Their fi&s;hing and hunting-implements lie ready on their canoes for u&s;e, &s;trapped on, for &s;afety; and differ little from tho&s;e u&s;ed by the Greenlanders.</P>
<P>Fi&s;hes common to other northern &s;eas are found here, north of 60&deg;. Small fi&s;h is not to be met with; but the whales are more numerous. Sea-hor&s;es are &s;een in prodigious numbers about the ice; and the &s;ea-otter is an animal peculiar to this &s;ea.</P>
<P>The few land-birds we &s;aw, &s;ays Captain <HI>Cooke,</HI> are the &s;ame with tho&s;e in Europe; but, there are many others, I had not an opportunity of knowing. Sea and water-fowls are not met with here in &s;uch numbers, nor in &s;uch variety, as in the northern parts of the At|lantic ocean.</P>
<P>There are no deer in Oonala&s;hka, or any other of the&s;e i&s;lands; not have they any dome&s;tic animals, not even dogs. Hence it is evident, that the &s;ea and rivers &s;upply the inhabitants chiefly with food. They are ob|liged, al&s;o, to the &s;ea for wood; I mean drift-wood; for, not a &s;tick grows on any of the i&s;lands, nor on the adjacent coa&s;ts of the continent.</P>
<P>There are a great variety of plants at Oonala&s;hka; and, mo&s;t of them were in bloom, the latter end of June. Several of them are &s;uch as we find in Europe; and, in many parts of America, particularly in New|foundland.
<PB N="120" REF="127">
Berries there are of various kinds; &s;uch as bramble-berries, cranberries, hurtle-berries, heath-berries, &amp;c. and, al&s;o, a brown berry, &s;omewhat the ta&s;te of a &s;loe, from which brandy might be di&s;tilled. Of culinary plants, they have wild pur&s;lane, pea-tops, a kind of &s;curvy-gra&s;s, cre&s;&s;es, and &s;ome others, all very palatable. On the low grounds, is plenty of gra&s;s, which grows very thick and long, and in which ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tle might &s;ub&s;i&s;t at Oonala&s;hka, the whole year, without being hou&s;ed; and the &s;oil, in many places, &s;eems capable of producing grain, roots and vegetables, but none is cultivated.</P>
<P>The people of Oonala&s;hka bury their dead on the &s;ummit of hills, and rai&s;e a little hillock over the grave. In a walk, &s;ays Captain <HI>Cooke,</HI> into the country, one of the natives, who attended me, pointed out &s;everal; and, one in particular, by the &s;ide of the road, over which was rai&s;ed a heap of &s;tones; and, I ob&s;erved, that, every one who pa&s;&s;ed, added a &s;tone to the number.</P>
<P>They are remarkably chearful and friendly among each other. The Ru&s;&s;ians keep up a re&s;erve among them; and have no connexion with their women, merely becau&s;e they are not chri&s;tians. The venereal di&s;ea&s;e is general among&s;t them; and they are &s;ubject to cancers, which tho&s;e who are afflicted with, take great pains to conceal. They do not appear to be long-lived; Captain <HI>Cooke</HI> &s;aw none, &s;eemingly, more advanced in life, than between 50 and 60.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="128">The natives of Oonala&s;hka, and tho&s;e on the north|we&s;t &s;ide of America, re&s;emble the Greenlanders and E&s;kimaux, not only in various particulars of per&s;on, dre&s;s, weapons, canoes, and the like, but in their lan|guage, which warrants this judgment, that there is great rea&s;on to believe the&s;e nations are of the &s;ame extraction.

<HEAD>OF THE SCHAMANE RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING had occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the pagan re|ligion of the Siberians and Ea&s;tern I&s;landers, and having entered but &s;lightly into the doctrines of Scha|mani&s;m, my reader will probably not be di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;ome further account of it; I will therefore lay before him the great outlines of it, without de&s;cending to the minutiae.</P>
<P>The &s;everal pagan nations that inhabit the Ru&s;&s;ian empire, are di&s;tingui&s;hed as the profe&s;&s;ors of three re|ligions: the Schamane, that of Lama, and that of the Bramins. The la&s;t is the faith of only a &s;mall number
<PB N="122" REF="129">
of Indians found in this empire; the former is by far the mo&s;t numerous, branching out into the different &s;ects of Finns, Tartars, Samojedes, Ea&s;tjaiks, Man|&s;hours, Mongols, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Schamane idolatry is one of the mo&s;t ancient that exi&s;ts; it is the &s;ource or origin of the Lama, the Bramine, and various, other, pagan &s;ects. This ido|latrous &s;ect is without much order or connexion, and is full of ab&s;urdity; but I will endeavour to throw it into the be&s;t general &s;y&s;tem I can, without entering into the various diver&s;ities, as followed by different &s;ects.</P>
<P>Among all the Schamanes, women are held much in|ferior to men; and are thought to have been created merely for &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, to people the world, and look after dome&s;tic affairs; of cour&s;e, are treated with great &s;everity and contempt. They are &s;carce allowed the common prerogatives of humanity; are held as impure, and reprobated by the gods; are con&s;idered as noxious during the period of their &s;exual revolutions; and in child-birth are &s;uppo&s;ed dangerous and fatal both to men and animals. They are prohibited the wor&s;hip of idols; and are thought to defile every thing they touch. They are con&s;idered as articles of mer|chandize; and a woman delivered of twins or a de|formed child, is thought to have had commerce with the devil.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="130">Yet, notwith&s;tanding this univer&s;al contempt of the female &s;ex, they admit the women to be prie&s;te&s;&s;es, and a&s;cribe to them equal pre-eminence and power with their prie&s;ts, and reverence &s;uch women as much. Both prie&s;ts and prie&s;te&s;&s;es are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the laity no otherwi&s;e than by their peculiar manner, and a little more knowledge of the ceremonies of their faith. Some are enthu&s;ia&s;ts, &s;ome impo&s;tors, but the greate&s;t number are a compound of both.</P>
<P>Their dre&s;s has been already de&s;cribed, and a plate given to repre&s;ent it. (See that of Tungu&s;e Sorcery.) The drum is the principal implement of their magic; and they pretend to beat it in &s;uch a manner, as to make &s;pirits appear and di&s;appear at plea&s;ure. This drum has been particularly de&s;cribed when we treated of Lapland. If it was cu&s;tomary for prie&s;ts of anti|quity to follow armies to war, it is po&s;&s;ible that the u&s;e of the drum in regiments might have originated in this religious tabor.</P>
<P>The principles and notions of the Schamanes are im|perfect, ob&s;cure, confu&s;ed, and contradictory; but they all agree in e&s;&s;entials. They all believe a univer&s;al God, the creator of all things; that he loves his crea|tion; knows every thing, and is all-powerful; but pays no attention to the particular actions of man, being too great for them to offend him, and to do any thing meritorious in his &s;ight. Of cour&s;e, as he neither pu|ni&s;hes
<PB N="124" REF="131">
nor rewards, it is u&s;ele&s;s to love him, and there is no rea&s;on to fear him.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e heathens think that God is invi&s;ible; that he has a human figure, and that he dwells in the &s;un or the &s;ky; whil&s;t others take the &s;un it&s;elf to be God.</P>
<P>Different nations have different divinities, with dif|ferent influences; but they are all &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ubordinate to the controul of the Great Creator. Some of the&s;e deities are beneficent per&s;ons, &s;ome maleficent. Of the latter, <HI>Scha&iuml;tan</HI> is the head of all the re&s;t; they con&s;ider him as the mo&s;t powerful being, after the &s;upreme God; repre&s;ent him as violently wicked, but think it po&s;&s;ible to appea&s;e him; and that the Schamans, or prie&s;ts, are particularly in his favour. They hold evil to be a &s;elf-exi&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance, di&s;tingui&s;hed by a variety of names; but all their notions, on this head, are confu&s;ed, and unconnected. The&s;e evil &s;pirits are &s;uppo&s;ed to be lords of the earth, lords of iron, &s;pirits of the moun|tains, demons of the fore&s;ts, gods of in&s;ects, and to dwell in the water, under the earth, in volcanoes and in fore&s;ts.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e different deities, they addre&s;s a certain wor&s;hip to the manes of their ance&s;tors, of the &s;ettlers of colonies, heroes, and all the prie&s;ts and prie&s;te&s;&s;es of Schamani&s;m; attributing to the&s;e demi-gods, a perfect
<PB N="125" REF="132">
knowledge of every thing below, and a power to pro|cure happine&s;s, or &s;uccour, to their applicants and votaries.</P>
<P>The notions they have of the world, and the uni|ver&s;e, are confined within the narrow bounds of that knowledge they are able to acquire in the de&s;arts. They conceive the world to be eternal; and, that future life, is but a continuation of the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Man, according to them, is compo&s;ed of body and &s;oul; is free, and his actions arbitrary; and, as the gods are indifferent to the actions of man, he is at liberty to act as he plea&s;es. Health, a thriving flock, a numerous progeny, and a frequent enjoyment of &s;en&s;ual embraces, con&s;titute their &s;upreme felicity; misfortunes, and the want of the&s;e enjoyments, are their greate&s;t evils.</P>
<P>All the profe&s;&s;ors of Schamani&s;m, believe an exi&s;tence after death; but have &s;uch uncomfortable ideas of that &s;tate, as to dread it. They &s;uppo&s;e death to be a change of the pre&s;ent life, into a &s;ubterraneous one, of the &s;ame kind; but purely intellectual and &s;piritual, though gloomy and melancholy. They attribute a &s;oul to every animal; and, though they are convinced, that every thing rots by di&s;&s;olution, they bury, with the dead, implements for his u&s;e in the other world. The more ea&s;tern Siberians, the Kurilians, and Kamt&s;cha|dales, maintain, like the Mahomedans, that the future
<PB N="126" REF="133">
life, though a continuation of the pre&s;ent, will be more perfect, and their enjoyments greater; that they &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s more wealth and finer women; of cour&s;e, they meet death with ardor, and often put an end to their exi&s;tence here, with the utmo&s;t coolne&s;s.</P>
<P>The ceremonies of their wor&s;hip differ, according to the different nations; but all con&s;i&s;t in prayers, the wor&s;hip of the beneficent divinities, &s;acrificing offerings, magic rites, and &s;uper&s;titious mummery. The ado|rations, both public and private, prove, that many of the&s;e nations fear the gods, and &s;everal di&s;cover a &s;in|cere devotion. All their prayers are very laconic. The laity, by &s;hort, but devout invocations, pray for a &s;up|ply of what they want. The &s;upplicant turns his face to the &s;un, to a mountain, a river, or an idol; and invokes them, as do the Roman Catholics, with great fervency, calling on every &s;aint by his proper name.</P>
<P>Their magic ceremonies are de&s;igned to appea&s;e ma|lignant &s;pirits; and are &s;o ab&s;urd, and contain &s;o much vi&s;ible impo&s;ture, that we cannot allow the&s;e people that indulgent pity we owe to men under the guidance of ignorant and deluded prie&s;ts. The laity have hone&s;t and good de&s;igns, in their idol-wor&s;hip; but, the prie&s;ts, impo&s;e on their &s;implicity; and, we find, that fraud and fanatici&s;m, are not incompatible in the hu|man mind.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="134">But, in &s;pite of all that ob&s;curity and confu&s;ion, which prevail in the religion of the Schamans, and its mythology, we cannot but di&s;cover, through them, the general notions of natural religion, as well as various ceremonies of Mo&s;aic law. The &s;acred fire, the ob|lations, the adorations, the opinions with re&s;pect to women, with many other articles of Schamane faith, &s;eem to be borrowed from the ceremonial of Judai&s;m. The chief cau&s;es that contribute to perpetuate their errors, are, the &s;en&s;uality and materiali&s;m of all their opinions; their wild and vagabond way of life; their extreme poverty, and, of cour&s;e, their total want of education. All the&s;e ob&s;tacles, in conjunction, are a bar to their improvements; but if, in a future pe|riod, the&s;e, or the greate&s;t part of them, &s;hould be re|moved; there is every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, from their tractable and excellent di&s;po&s;ition, they may be in|duced to &s;hake off their errors; and, that the chri&s;tian religion, will be tran&s;planted into the&s;e, the remote&s;t regions of the earth.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF LITTLE RUSSIA. From <HI>Perry, Hanway, King, Wraxall, Coxe,</HI> and others.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING treated largely of the wide, extended and uncivilized parts of this va&s;t empire, it is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould give my readers &s;ome account of that part which is called Little Ru&s;&s;ia; and which includes the kingdoms of Mo&s;cow and A&s;tracan; parts into which, within the&s;e 50 years, European manners have been introduced: and, in doing this, I will re&s;ume that &s;y&s;tem I had adopted in the fir&s;t volume of this work; but which the celebrated journal of <HI>Pallas</HI> in|duced me to drop, whil&s;t &s;peaking of Siberia and Tartary.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="129" REF="136">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Country, Climate, and Productions.</HEAD>
<P>THE country compri&s;ed under the name of Ru&s;&s;ia, or the Ru&s;&s;ias, is of greater extent than all the re&s;t of Europe; or, than was the Roman em|pire, in the zenith of its power. It &s;tretches from the Baltic, and Sweden, on the we&s;t, beyond Kamt&s;chatka, and the Oriental I&s;les, 5,000 miles, and upwards, ea&s;t|ward, to the mo&s;t we&s;tern &s;hore of the American con|tinent; which, as I have already ob&s;erved, is divided from the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Siberia, by a &s;treight of only 13 leagues in breadth. On the north, it is bounded by the Frozen Ocean; and extends, on the &s;outh-ea&s;t, to China and Per&s;ia. The greate&s;t part of this em|pire lies in A&s;ia; of this, we have already treated; I &s;hall, therefore, confine my&s;elf now to that part which lies in Europe.</P>
<P>Little Ru&s;&s;ia then extends from the 47th degree of north-latitude, to the 70th, or further north, but is &s;carce habitable nearer the pole; and, from the 21&s;t degree of longitude to the 70th, reckoning from the meridian of London. In the &s;outhern provinces, the longe&s;t day does not exceed fifteen hours and a half; whereas, in the mo&s;t northern, the &s;un does not &s;et, in &s;ummer-time, for the &s;pace of two months together; and here, during the winter, which generally continues
<PB N="130" REF="137">
&s;even months, the whole country is covered with &s;now, a yard or two deep, and the rivers are all frozen up. It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, therefore, that where the cli|mate is &s;o various, there mu&s;t be as great a diver&s;ity of &s;oil.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>King,</HI> who re&s;ided eleven years in Ru&s;&s;ia, &s;ays, that the cold, at Peter&s;burgh, which is in the latitude of 60&deg;, is, during the months of December, January, and February, u&s;ually, by <HI>Fahrenheit</HI>'s thermometer, from eight to 15, and 20 degrees below 0; that is, from 40 to 52 degrees below the freezing point; that the inhabitants have very little comfort in their winter-days, and &s;pend mo&s;t of their time by the fire-&s;ide; for, though the &s;un may be a little above the horizon, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wo or three hours, it is &s;eldom &s;een, on account of the thick fogs, which &s;o darken the air, that it may be rather called dawn, than day-light. The cold weather begins in Augu&s;t; and, every one is wrapped in furs till May following. The ice, in their rivers, is a yard thick. It is difficult, &s;ays Dr. <HI>King,</HI> for an inhabitant of a temperate clime, to have any idea of their cold. When a per&s;on walks out, in winter, the cold makes the eyes water; and, that water, freezes on the eye-la&s;hes, &s;o as to hang in i&s;icles. The&s;e i&s;icles may be &s;een hanging at the chin of their pea&s;ants, who wear their beards, like a lump of ice; but, even in this &s;tate, the icy beard defends the glands of the throat, which the &s;oldiers, who wear no beards, are obliged to
<PB N="131" REF="138">
guard, by tying a handkerchief under the chin. All the parts of the face are liable to be frozen, though the per&s;on &s;o frozen is not him&s;elf &s;en&s;ible of it; but is commonly appri&s;ed of it by tho&s;e who meet him, and advi&s;ed to rub his face with &s;now, which is their mode of thawing it, for the part frozen always turns white; &s;hould this be omitted, and the per&s;on &s;o frozen pproach a fire, or dip his ears, no&s;e, or chin, in warm water, the frozen part will in&s;tantly mortify, and drop off. In &s;evere winters, birds have been &s;o be|numbed, as to be unable to fly; and carters &s;itting in their loaded carriages, have been found frozen to death. When the thermometer has been at 25 degrees below 0, boiling water thrown up into the air, and &s;pread by an engine, has fallen to the ground in ice. But, notwith|&s;tanding this &s;everity of the cold, the inhabitants have &s;uch various means to guard again&s;t it, that they &s;uffer much le&s;s from it, than might be expected. Mr. <HI>Coxe</HI> &s;ays, that, when he was there, in January, the mercury in <HI>Fahrenheit</HI>'s thermometer, fell to 63 below the freez|ing point, and yet it did not detain him at home; he walked out, as u&s;ual, with no other precaution than his peli&s;&s;e, fur-boots and cap; and, as the &s;un &s;hone bright, he found it by no means unplea&s;ant. The com|mon people continued at their work, as u&s;ual; and the drivers plied in the &s;treets, with their &s;ledges, &s;eem|ingly unaffected with the fro&s;t; their beards were in|cru&s;ted with ice, and the hor&s;es covered with i&s;icles. The people did not, during this extreme cold, add to
<PB N="132" REF="139">
their ordinary cloathing. They are careful to pre&s;erve their extremities, by covering their legs, hands, and head, with fur; but leave their necks quite bare, and their brea&s;ts only covered with a coar&s;e &s;hirt. During this time, continues Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> many women were em|ployed in wa&s;hing in the river, making holes in the ice with a hatchet, dipping their linen into the water with their bare hands, and beating it with flat &s;ticks. The ice formed again, almo&s;t as &s;oon as they broke it; and, yet they would &s;tand hours at this work&mdash;a proof that the human body may be brought to endure all extremes.</P>
<P>Coachmen and &s;ervants, waiting for their ma&s;ters, have been killed by the fro&s;t: to guard, as much as po&s;&s;ible, again&s;t this, great fires, of whole trees, piled up, are made, in the court yards of the palace, and mo&s;t frequented parts of the town, to warm the air. The rain that falls in this country yearly, exceeds that which falls in England, in the proportion of 22 to 19.</P>
<P>Ru&s;&s;ia is, in general, a flat country, except in the north. From Peter&s;burgh to Pekin in China, through Independant Tartary, &s;carce a mountain is to be &s;een; and, from Peter&s;burgh to the north of France, by Dantzic, Hamburgh, and Am&s;terdam, there is not the &s;malle&s;t hill.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="140">The mo&s;t con&s;iderable rivers are, 1&s;t, the Wolga, which, after traver&s;ing the greate&s;t part of Mu&s;covy, in a cour&s;e of 3000 miles, empties it&s;elf into the Ca&s;pian &s;ea. It is, in mo&s;t places, &s;o &s;hallow, that ve&s;&s;els, drawing above five feet water, can &s;carcely float, except in flood-times, when the large&s;t flat-bottomed ve&s;&s;els, even car|rying 600 tuns, find &s;ufficient water. The &s;tream, in common, does not run more than one mile an hour; but, in flood-time, it will run three miles. The water-men, who navigate this river, do it by warping. They have three boats to carry out the&s;e warps, which they take in forwards, and thus get on again&s;t the &s;tream, when the wind is not with them, 30 miles a-day. Their barges are &s;o large as to carry from 150 to 200 men. In all its long cour&s;e, it has not a cataract to interrupt the navigation; and, by it, the city of Mo&s;|cow has a communication not only with all the &s;outh|ern parts of Ru&s;&s;ia, but even into Per&s;ia, Georgia, Tartary, and all the countries bordering on the Ca&s;|pian &s;ea.</P>
<P>The Don is another great river; divides the ea&s;tern part of Ru&s;&s;ia from A&s;ia; and, in its cour&s;e ea&s;twards, approaches &s;o near the Wolga, that it was intended to cut a canal between the two; and it would have been done, but for the interruption of the Tartars. This river runs near 400 miles, and empties it&s;elf into the &s;ea of A&s;oph. The Dnieper, which is likewi&s;e one of the large&s;t rivers in Europe, has thirteen cataracts
<PB N="134" REF="141">
within a &s;mall di&s;tance; ri&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ar the &s;ource of the Wolga, in the fore&s;t of the Volken&s;ki (a fore&s;t of 150 mile in length, and that reaches almo&s;t to the gates of Mo&s;cow), about 100 miles from Smolen&s;ko; &s;eparates the Ukraine from Poland, and di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Black Sea. By the acqui&s;ition of the province of Mohilef, it is included within the Ru&s;&s;ian territories. The northern, and north-ea&s;tern provinces, are, in a manner, de&s;art; but, the re&s;t of the country abounds with fore&s;ts.</P>
<P>The principal cities are, Peter&s;burgh, Mo&s;cow, No|vogorod, Twer, Smolen&s;ko, Kiova, Riga, Archangel, Ca&s;an, and A&s;trachan. Of &s;ome of the&s;e I have already &s;poken.</P>
<P>Ru&s;&s;ia being, for the mo&s;t part, a level country, and extremely well watered by lakes and rivers, is abund|antly fruitful. The communication of one part of the empire with another, is laid open, by roads and navi|gable canals; &s;o that, the northern parts, which wanted corn and fruits, &s;o plentiful in the &s;outh, are now &s;up|plied with both. In the &s;pring of the year, as &s;oon as the &s;now is gone, which generally lies on the ground three months, the warm weather &s;ucceeds, every thing looks green, and the tulips, lilies of the valley, and many other fine flowers and herbs, &s;pring up &s;pontaneou&s;ly, without culture; and vegetation is very quick, in all its branches. The &s;hortne&s;s of the &s;ummer does not
<PB N="135" REF="142">
allow the grain time to ripen well; but the pea&s;ants contrive to dry it, in the following way: they con&s;truct a wooden building, &s;omething like the &s;hell of a cot|tage, without windows; under this building is a large hollow, on which a fire being made, the new cut corn, in ear, is laid on the floor, till dry; after this, it is hung on frames, in the open air, and then thre&s;hed. Pa&s;tures and meadows are very prolific; but they have no fruits, except &s;trawberries and ra&s;berries: as to the finer fruits, &s;uch as pines, apricots, grapes, pears, and cherries, they cannot be obtained, but in hot-hou&s;es. They have, however, excellent melons, pomegranates, and pines, from A&s;trachan. Grapes are brought, from A&s;trachan, to the Empre&s;s, every three days; a di&s;tance not le&s;s than 1500 miles. They are pre&s;erved in &s;and, and carried between two hor&s;es, &s;upported in the manner of a litter, and are 21 days on their journey.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;es have a &s;aying, That they are very rich in fi&s;h and bread; and, it may be added, they have good &s;tore of hor&s;es, cattle, and wild game. Provi&s;ions are &s;o cheap, that good beef may be bought for three farthings a pound; mutton and pork in proportion; and bread, at about one &s;ixth part of the u&s;ual price in England. The broad-tailed &s;heep are brought from A&s;trachan; and are, in flavour, &s;omething like ve|ni&s;on.</P>
<P>On account of the &s;evere cold in this country, not only water-fowl, cranes, &s;wans, ducks, gee&s;e, &s;nipes, &amp;c.
<PB N="136" REF="143">
but almo&s;t all &s;orts of land-birds, fly to the &s;outhward, in winter, in infinite numbers; and back again in the &s;pring, when the &s;now di&s;appears; which, in the lati|tude of Mo&s;cow, is not till about the end of April.</P>
<P>Their hor&s;es are not of a large breed; but, like tho&s;e of Scotland, hardy and &s;erviceable; and are &s;eldom &s;hod, either in &s;ummer or winter. They have grey|hounds, but no hounds. Their wild bea&s;ts are, bears, foxes, boars, elks, deer, wolves, wild hor&s;es, and wild &s;heep. Captain <HI>Perry</HI> &s;ays, he ate part of a wild &s;heep, which was pur&s;ued into a river by a wolf, and he thought it more tender and palatable than tame mutton. They have, al&s;o, martens, &s;ables, ermines, and two kinds of hares, one of which turns white in the winter, and changes again in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>There is no country, in Europe, better &s;tocked with bees; and their woods, accordingly, afford great plenty of honey; and the wealthy burn nothing but wax-candles. The woods, and gardens, about Mo&s;cow, are full of &s;inging-birds; but there being few in the neigh|bourhood of Peter&s;burgh, government purcha&s;ed as many as came to &s;ix or &s;even hundred pounds, and let them fly into the woods about that capital, where, it is &s;aid, they have multiplied exceedingly.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the mines of this country, they have been treated of fully, when de&s;cribing Tartary and Siberia.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the People, and chief Cities.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING can be more erroneous, than the different accounts of the population of this em|pire. <HI>Voltaire</HI> tells us, that, by a li&s;t, taken in 1747, of all the males that paid the poll-tax, including boys and old men, the number amounted to near &s;even mil|lions; and, if we reckon three times this number, for females, and per&s;ons not regi&s;tered, it will make about 20 millions; and, to the&s;e add, 350,000 &s;oldiers, and 200,000 nobility and clergy, and foreigners, exempted from the poll-tax, and the number will be about 20 millions and a half; which, with the conquered Tar|tars, may be e&s;timated at 24 millions. But Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> in a much better calculation, in 1764, thinks, they may &s;urely be &s;tated at near 23 millions.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians are, generally &s;peaking, a per&s;onable people, rather Dutch-built, and inclined to be cor|pulent; at lea&s;t, this is what they admire: they are hardy, vigorous, and patient of labour. Their com|plexions differ from tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h, or Scots; but the women think an addition of red paint, heightens their beauty. Their eye-&s;ight &s;eems to be defective; perhaps owing to the &s;now. The army po&s;&s;e&s;s a great &s;hare of pa&s;&s;ive and active valour; will live hard, and &s;ubmit to the &s;tricte&s;t di&s;cipline. The temper of the
<PB N="138" REF="145">
Ru&s;&s;ians, however, has not been much admired: they are held to have good parts, but to be very deceitful, and not to have a proper &s;en&s;e of &s;hame. Captain <HI>Perry,</HI> who was &s;ome time in that country, in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, &s;ays, that the foreigners there u&s;ed to &s;ay, That if you wi&s;h to know whether a Ru&s;s is an hone&s;t man, look in the palm of his hand, and, if you don't find hair grow there, never tru&s;t him. When they flatter and &s;ooth, and profe&s;s, with oaths and a&s;&s;e|verations, a great re&s;pect for you, be well upon your guard, for they mean to betray you; and &s;o far are they wanting, continues he, in a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, that they hold it a commendable quality, to be a &s;harper; and &s;ay, that &s;uch a man, under&s;tands the world, and will thrive: but, of an hone&s;t man, they &s;ay, <HI>Un cloup nemeit &s;hiet;</HI> he is a blockhead, and knows not how to live. And, &s;o little regard have they for their word, and &s;o void of any notion of real honour, that they have not a word, in their language, to expre&s;s it. The czar, Peter, took a great deal of pains to inculcate proper principles into them; and they do not now, de|&s;erve &s;o &s;evere a character. Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> who was there very lately, &s;ays, even the pea&s;ants, in their common intercour&s;e, are remarkably polite to each other. They take off their caps at meeting, bow ceremoniou&s;ly, and frequently and u&s;ually exchange a &s;alute. They ac|company their ordinary di&s;cour&s;e with much action, and innumerable ge&s;tures; and are exceedingly &s;ervile in their expre&s;&s;ions of deference to their &s;uperiors. In
<PB N="139" REF="146">
acco&s;ting a per&s;on of con&s;equence, they pro&s;trate them|&s;elves, and even touch the ground with their heads&mdash; a kind of ea&s;tern homage. They are greedy, however, of money; and almo&s;t always demand previous pay|ment, for any article they &s;ell; and they &s;eem, in ge|neral, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> much inclined to thieving. It was found nece&s;&s;ary to place a guard by the carriage, at night, where we &s;topped, or every article in it would have di&s;appeared before morning.</P>
<P>Among the better cla&s;s of people, continues Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> nothing can exceed their ho&s;pitality. We could never pay a morning-vi&s;it to any nobleman, without being detained to dinner. The principal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, keep open tables, and are highly obliged to per&s;ons who re&s;ort to them, without ceremony. Their tables are &s;erved with great profu&s;ion and ta&s;te. They will, at the &s;ame time, have &s;terlet (a kind of &s;turgeon from the Wolga), veal from Archangel, mutton from A&s;trachan, beef from the Ukraine, and phea&s;ants from Hungary and Bohemia; and their common wines are, claret, burgundy, champaigne; and Engli&s;h beer, and porter, in perfection. Though they have adopted the delicacies of French cookery, they de&s;pi&s;e not the &s;olid joints of the Engli&s;h. Before dinner, even in the hou&s;es of per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, a &s;mall table is &s;pread, in a corner of the drawing-room, covered with plates of caviare, dried and pickled herrings, &s;moked ham, or tongue, bread, butter and chee&s;e; with bottles of dif|ferent
<PB N="140" REF="147">
<HI>liqueurs;</HI> a little of which is generally ta&s;ted be|fore dinner. Their u&s;ual hour of dining is three; their entertainments are regulated according to the French ceremonial; the wine being circulated, during meals; and, the di&s;hes are no &s;ooner removed, than the com|pany retire into another room, and are &s;erved with coffee, gentlemen as well as ladies.</P>
<P>Drunkenne&s;s is &s;o common among the lower cla&s;s of people, that it is &s;carcely e&s;teemed a vice. Captain <HI>Perry</HI> &s;ays, that, if we ride through Mo&s;cow on a holiday, we &s;hall &s;ee both prie&s;ts and people drunk upon the ground; and, if you go to help one up, he will &s;ay, by way of excu&s;e, It is holiday-time. Nay, he &s;ays further, that their women of quality are &s;o little a&s;hamed of drinking to exce&s;s, that they will acknow|ledge their having been drunk, and return thanks to their friends who made them &s;o. This was, however, near a century ago; Mr. <HI>Coxe</HI> &s;ays now, that, among per&s;ons of rank, they never deviate from the &s;tricte&s;t &s;obriety.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wraxall</HI> tells us (and he travelled there in 1774), That the females in this country are all forced, and brought forward in de&s;pite of nature; that, during the winter-months, they are con&s;tantly in apartments heated by &s;toves to a great degree, from which they enter, upon a ha&s;ty, but hot &s;ummer, of two or three months. The con&s;equence of this, added to their
<PB N="141" REF="148">
warm baths, of which they are very fond, is, that they want, like every other artificial production, the ge|nuine flavor, which nature only can give; that charm|ing firmne&s;s, and ela&s;ticity of fle&s;h, &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ibly re|qui&s;ite to con&s;titute beauty. The ladies e&s;teemed as beauties here, are ponderous and ma&s;&s;y; and loveli|ne&s;s &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in a woman's weighing near 200 lb. In giving a de&s;cription of &s;ome of the principal cities, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the people again, of cour&s;e will drop the &s;ubject for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Peter&s;burgh, the capital of the empire, was founded by Peter the Great, in the beginning of this century, and has amazingly increa&s;ed in &s;ize within the&s;e fifty years. At the death of Peter, it did not contain above 80,000 inhabitants, and now the Ru&s;&s;ians a&s;&s;ert that there are 500,000; but this, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> is an exaggeration. The number, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> is about 130,000; and the city is, perhaps, the only one in Eu|rope where there are more births than deaths.</P>
<P>Peter&s;burgh lies in 60 degrees N. latitude, and is built at the mouth of the river Neva, on &s;everal i&s;lands, which were once nothing more than mar&s;hy &s;pots of mud, over-run with reeds, as indeed is all the country round; but the immortal founder, who&s;e undertakings in every thing carried a magnificence of idea in them, converted a mi&s;erable bog into a fine city; for Peter&s;burgh is the &s;oul of commerce in all

the&s;e northern parts; it is the foundation on which all the Ru&s;&s;ian naval force has been erected; is &s;o well fortified, as to be impregnable; and the port on which their nur&s;ery of &s;ailors mo&s;t depends. But, notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e capital circum&s;tances, it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged very deficient, as a receptacle of the men of war of a great empire; for the depth of water; the fre&s;hne&s;s of it; the docks, yards, every thing at Pe|ter&s;burgh are again&s;t the u&s;e of it for that purpo&s;e. Indeed it is, at pre&s;ent, but an exten&s;ive outline, which will require future ages to complete. It &s;tands on a prodigious extent of ground; but, as the hou&s;es in many places do not join, and great &s;paces are uncover|ed, it's real &s;ize cannot be a&s;certained. The hou&s;es, like tho&s;e of Am&s;terdam, are all built upon piles; and, indeed, the place very much re&s;embles the cities in Hol|land; the &s;treets being very broad, as broad as the high-&s;treet in Oxford; with canals running through many of them, and &s;everal planted, on each &s;ide the canal, with trees. Though there are &s;ome errors in the plan, there are al&s;o &s;ome regular and well-built &s;treets, chiefly paved; but many of them floored with timber, which, in accidents of fire, carry the communication rapidly. The hou&s;es are very large, and the palaces of the nobility exceed, in &s;ize, tho&s;e of any other city. The public buildings are &s;o numerous, as to con&s;titute a fifth or &s;ixth part of the whole capital: and the hou&s;es of the nobility are mo&s;tly va&s;t piles of building, and furni&s;hed in the &s;ame elegant &s;tyle as at Paris or

London. They are chiefly of brick, ornamented with a white &s;tucco, which has led travellers to &s;uppo&s;e they are built of &s;tone. Mr. <HI>Coxe</HI> &s;ays there are but two &s;tone buildings in all Peter&s;burgh; one is the church of St. I&s;aac, not fini&s;hed, and the other a palace, building by the Empre&s;s, on the banks of the Neva, with hewn granite, and marble columns.</P>
<P>This palace of the Empre&s;s is an amazing &s;tructure. Indeed all the capital hou&s;es are rather great than beau|tiful; the &s;ize is all that &s;trike us; and they are &s;tuck &s;o thick with ornaments, as to leave us &s;carce room to judge of their proportion. The Italian architecture is mixed with the Dutch; and the whole forms but very inelegant buildings, in which true ta&s;te is &s;acrificed to &s;plendor. If the eye does not &s;crutinize into the &s;e|rate parts of the buildings, but takes in only the &s;treets at large, the city may be pronounced a very fine one. Many of the hou&s;es are erected with wood, the &s;ides con&s;i&s;ting of &s;quare-&s;ided pieces of timber, laid upon each other. The roofs are thin, deal &s;pars, laid pretty thick, and lined with laths, covered with turf, or bark. The hou&s;es are &s;eldom more than one &s;tory high; and tho&s;e of the common people con&s;i&s;t of but one room; but the public buildings have throughout a very hand|&s;ome appearance, and are, like every thing el&s;e, on a larger &s;cale than el&s;ewhere. The churches have gene|rally a large cupola, encircled with four &s;maller ones, and covered with gilt copper, which has a fine effect in the &s;un&s;hine.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="152">The river Neva, which runs through the city, is in mo&s;t places broader than the Thames at London; is deep, rapid, and as clear as cry&s;tal. Its banks exhibit the mo&s;t grand and lively &s;cenes; they are lined on each &s;ide with a continued range of hand&s;ome build|ings, and it has one of the fine&s;t walks in the world; not a quay, but a parade, a mile long, which is &s;till to be continued further in length. It is embanked by a para|pet-wall, and has a pavement of hewn granite. Over the river is a bridge of pontoons; but a Ru&s;&s;ian pea|&s;ant has projected the &s;ublime plan of throwing a wooden bridge, of a &s;ingle arch, acro&s;s it, where the river is only 680 feet wide, and which is to be built with all expedition; it is to be roofed over, and to tower 168 feet from the water. The road is not to be carried over the arch, but to hang to, or be &s;u&s;pended in the middle, below it. The e&s;timate for building this bridge is 60,000l. &s;terling. The bridge is upon the &s;ame principle with that of Schaffhau&s;en, excepting that the mechani&s;m is more complicated, and that the road is not &s;o level; the a&s;cent of the road of the bridge at Schaffhau&s;en being barely four-tenths of an inch to a foot. The per&s;on, who&s;e name is <HI>Kulibin,</HI> who projected this bridge, is merely a Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ant; has a long beard, and wears the common dre&s;s of his country; he receives, however, a pen&s;ion from the empre&s;s, and is encouraged to follow the bent of his mechanical genius, which is truly uncommon. Though rather foreign to our &s;ubject, it may not be unenter|taining

to our readers to have the following account of a repeating-watch that he made. It is about the &s;ize of an egg; within, is repre&s;ented the tomb of our Saviour, with the &s;tone at the entrance, and the cen|tinels on duty; &s;uddenly, the &s;tone is removed, the centinels fall down, the angels appear, the women enter the &s;epulchre, and the &s;ame chant is heard which is per|formed on Ea&s;ter Eve.&mdash;This watch is depo&s;ited in the Academy of Sciences at Peter&s;burgh.</P>
<P>One of the noble&s;t monuments paid to the veneration of the founder of this city, is the eque&s;trian &s;tatue of that monarch, ca&s;t in bronze, by that celebrated French &s;tatuary, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Falconet,</HI> at the expence of the Em|pre&s;s, and erected in the area before the palace. A de&s;cription of it, being a wonderful undertaking, can|not di&s;plea&s;e our readers: The pede&s;tal on which it &s;tands, is a &s;tupendous ma&s;s of reddi&s;h granite, which was di&s;covered, half buried, in the mid&s;t of a mora&s;s, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the city. The mora&s;s was drained, to get it out; and a road was cut, through a fore&s;t, to pa&s;s it. After it was reduced, it weighed 1500 tons. It was drawn, with 40 men &s;eated on the top of it, by a windla&s;s, and large friction balls, placed in grooves, and fixed on each &s;ide of the road, to the banks of the river; on which it was conveyed, in a ve&s;|&s;el con&s;tructed purpo&s;ely to receive it, to the place where it now &s;tands. At its ba&s;e, it is 42 feet long, 36 at the top, 21 thick, and 17 high&mdash;a bulk greatly
<PB N="146" REF="154">
&s;urpa&s;&s;ing, in weight, the mo&s;t boa&s;ted monuments of Roman grandeur. The &s;tatue is of colo&s;&s;al &s;ize; and repre&s;ents the monarch in the attitude of mounting a precipice, the &s;ummit of which he has nearly attained. He is crowned with laurel; in a loo&s;e, A&s;iatic ve&s;t, and &s;itting on a bear-&s;kin hou&s;ing; his right hand &s;tretched as in the act of ble&s;&s;ing his people, and his left hold|ing the reins. The hor&s;e is rearing on his hind legs; and his tail, which is full and flowing, &s;lightly touches a bronze &s;erpent, artfully contrived to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;upport|ing the va&s;t weight of the &s;tatue, in due equilibrium. It was erected in 1782; and its erection attended with great &s;olemnity. A proclamation was offered, at the time, to pardon all criminals, under &s;entence of death; all de&s;erters, who &s;hould return to their duty, within a limited time; and all convicts, condemned to hard la|bour, provided they had not been guilty of murder.</P>
<P>In 1706, <HI>Peter</HI> began the foundation of the fortre&s;s. Its walls are of brick, and &s;trengthened with five re|gular ba&s;tions; they encircle a &s;mall i&s;land, of about half a mile in circumference, formed by the Great and Little Neva. Within the walls are barracks for a &s;mall garri|&s;on, &s;everal wards u&s;ed as a common jail, and dungeons for the confinement of &s;tate-pri&s;oners. In the fortre&s;s, is a &s;mall ar&s;enal, which, among other military &s;tores, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ains &s;ome antient cannon, ca&s;t in the middle of the 16th century. In a &s;eparate building of the fortre&s;s, is the mint. The gold and &s;ilver are &s;ent from the mines
<PB N="147" REF="155">
of Siberia; and the &s;eparation is performed in this laboratory. Large quantities of Dutch dollars are melted down here, for the purpo&s;e of coining into rubles; as half the duties are di&s;charged in that money, by all foreign merchants, excepting the Engli&s;h, who are exempted, by treaty; but as the&s;e, and the gold and &s;ilver obtained from the mines of Siberia, are, by no means, &s;ufficient for the money in circulation, a con|&s;iderable quantity of both the&s;e metals is annually im|ported. There is here a very ingenious and &s;imple piece of mechani&s;m&mdash;a machine for &s;tamping the coin; which mu&s;t not be omitted, becau&s;e it was an invention of her pre&s;ent maje&s;ty. Within the fortre&s;s, is a four-oared boat, called, <HI>The Little Grand&s;ire;</HI> which is &s;e|cured, with great veneration, in a brick building, con|&s;tructed for that purpo&s;e; and pre&s;erved, as a memorial to future ages, of its being the origin of the Ru&s;&s;ian fleet. Adjacent to the fortre&s;s, &s;tands a wooden hovel, dignified, by its having &s;erved for the habitation of <HI>Peter the Great,</HI> while the fortre&s;s was con&s;tructing. It &s;till exi&s;ts in its original &s;tate, and &s;tands under a brick building, purpo&s;ely erected to pre&s;erve it from de&s;|truction. Near this hou&s;e is another four-oared boat, the work of <HI>Peter</HI>'s own hands.</P>
<P>The cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, is in a different &s;tate of architecture, from that u&s;ually employed in the con&s;truction of churches for the &s;ervice of the Greek religion. In&s;tead of domes, it has a &s;pire of copper,
<PB N="148" REF="156">
gilt; the highe&s;t part of which ri&s;es above 240 feet from the ground. Its interior decorations of paintings, &amp;c. are in an elegant and modern &s;tile. In this cathedral, are depo&s;ited the remains of <HI>Peter the Great;</HI> and of all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;overeigns (excepting the late, unfortunate <HI>Peter the Third</HI>), who are ranged in coffins, &s;ide by &s;ide; but have not, any of them, marble monuments erected to their memories, bearing only in&s;criptions in the Ru&s;|&s;ian tongue on their tombs, which are &s;haped like &s;quare coffins. Devotion has not been wanting, to add her magnificence, and to erect places of wor&s;hip, in almo&s;t every part.</P>
<P>The market upon the Neva, is too remarkable to be omitted.&mdash;At the conclu&s;ion of the long fa&s;t, which clo&s;es on the 24th of December, O. S. the Ru&s;&s;ians lay in their provi&s;ions, for the remaining part of the winter: for this purpo&s;e, an annual market, or fair, which la&s;ts three days, is held upon the river, near the fortre&s;s. A long &s;treet, above a mile in length, is lined, on each &s;ide, with an immen&s;e &s;tore of provi&s;ions, &s;uf|ficient for the &s;upply of the capital, for the next three months. Many thou&s;and raw carca&s;es of oxen, &s;heep, hogs, pigs, together with gee&s;e, fowls, and every &s;pecies of frozen food, are expo&s;ed for &s;ale. The larger qua|drupedes are grouped, in various circles, upright, their hind legs fixed in the &s;now, with their heads and fore-legs turned towards each other. The&s;e tower above the re&s;t, and occupy the hindermo&s;t row; next to
<PB N="149" REF="157">
them &s;ucceeds a regular &s;eries of animals, de&s;cending gradually to the &s;malle&s;t; intermixed with poultry and game, hanging in fe&s;toons, and garni&s;hed with heaps of fi&s;h, butter and eggs. The mo&s;t di&s;tant quarters help to &s;upply this va&s;t &s;tore of provi&s;ions; and the fine&s;t veal has been &s;ent, by land-carriage, as far as from Archangel. Beef is &s;old at one penny the Ru&s;&s;ian pound, that is, fourteen ounces and an half Engli&s;h, pork at five farthings, and mutton at three halfpence; a goo&s;e for ten pence, a pig for eight pence, and all other articles in proportion. In order to ren|der their frozen food fit for dre&s;&s;ing, it is fir&s;t thawed in cold water.</P>
<P>The court of Peter&s;burgh has long enjoyed the re|putation of being one of the mo&s;t brilliant in Europe. Rich cloaths are &s;till the pa&s;&s;ion of the Ru&s;&s;ians; and, though &s;umptuary laws have been often talked of, and &s;et on foot, they have never properly been carried into execution. Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> who, with Lord <HI>Herbert,</HI> was pre&s;ented to the Empre&s;s, on the birth-day of the Grand Duke, who is next heir to the throne, and when a brilliant court was a&s;&s;embled, gives us the following account of it. At the entrance of the drawing-room, &s;tood two centinels of the foot-guards; their uniform, was a green coat, with red cuffs and cape, white wai&s;t|coat and breeches: they had &s;ilver helmets, fa&s;tened under the chin with &s;ilver cla&s;ps, and ornamented with an ample plume of red, yellow, black, and white fea|thers.
<PB N="150" REF="158">
Within the drawing-room, at the doors of the pa&s;&s;age leading to her maje&s;ty's apartments, were two &s;oldiers of the knights body-guard; a corps more &s;umptuou&s;ly accoutred than any in Europe. They wore ca&s;ques, like tho&s;e of the ancients, with a rich plumage of black feathers; and their whole dre&s;s was in the &s;ame &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le; chains, and broad plates of &s;olid &s;ilver, were braided over their uniforms, &s;o as to wear the appearance of a coat of mail; and their boots were richly ornamented with the &s;ame metal.</P>
<P>In the drawing-room were a numerous a&s;&s;embly of foreign mini&s;ters, Ru&s;&s;ian nobility, and officers, in their different uniforms, waiting the arrival of the Empre&s;s, who was attending divine &s;ervice in the chapel. There, amid a prodigious concour&s;e of nobles, &s;tood the Empre&s;s foremo&s;t by her&s;elf, behind a railing; the only di&s;tinc|tion by which her place was marked. Immediately next to her, &s;tood the Great Duke and Duche&s;s; and, behind, an indi&s;criminate throng of courtiers. The Empre&s;s bowed, and frequently cro&s;&s;ed her&s;elf, agree|able to the forms of the Greek church. When &s;he left the chapel, &s;he was preceded by the chief officers of her hou&s;hold, the mi&s;tre&s;s of the robes, her maids of honour, and other ladies of the bed-chamber, advanc|ing two by two. Her maje&s;ty followed, with &s;low and &s;olemn pace, walking with great pomp, and bowing, continually, to the right and left. She &s;topped at the entrance of the drawing-room, and &s;poke, with great
<PB N="151" REF="159">
affability, to the foreign mini&s;ters, whil&s;t they ki&s;&s;ed her hand. Her dre&s;s was a robe, with a &s;hort train; and a ve&s;t, with &s;leeves reaching to the wri&s;t, like a polone&s;e. The ve&s;t was of gold brocade, and the robe of light, green &s;ilk. Her hair was dre&s;&s;ed low, and lightly powdered; &s;he wore a cap &s;et thick with diamonds, and had on a great deal of rouge.</P>
<P>In the evening was a ball at court, which is always held on the third day. The Great Duke and Dutche&s;s opened it with a minuet; after which, the&s;e great per|&s;onages danced a minuet each with the principal nobi|lity; the Duke with a lady, and the Dutche&s;s with a gen|tleman: &s;everal other couples dancing minuets in dif|ferent parts of the circle. The&s;e minuets were &s;uc|ceeded by Poli&s;h dances; and the&s;e, by Engli&s;h country-dances. During the latter, the Empre&s;s came in, more richly apparelled than in the morning, and wearing a crown of diamonds upon her head.</P>
<P>On her maje&s;ty's appearance, the ball was &s;u&s;pended; and, the principal people paid their re&s;pects to the Empre&s;s. This done, &s;he a&s;cended an elevated &s;eat, and the dancing was re&s;umed. After this, &s;he withdrew to an inner room to cards, and played at Macao, at an Imperial, or two-pound a game, with the foreign mi|ni&s;ters. Her maje&s;ty retired about 10, and all was over.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="160">The Empre&s;s has a drawing-room every Sunday morning, about 12. The richne&s;s and &s;plendor of the Ru&s;&s;ian court &s;urpa&s;&s;es all the ideas which the mo&s;t ela|borate de&s;criptions can &s;ugge&s;t; retaining many traces of ancient A&s;iatic pomp, blended with European re|finement. An immen&s;e retinue of courtiers always precede, and follow, the Empre&s;s; the co&s;tline&s;s and glare of their apparel, and a profu&s;ion of precious &s;tones, create a &s;plendor, of which the magnificence of other courts can give only a faint idea. The court-dre&s;s of the men is in the French fa&s;hion: that of the ladies, is a gown and petticoat, with a &s;mall hoop; the gown has long hanging &s;leeves, and a &s;hort train, and is of a different colour from the petticoat. The ladies wore, in 1777, very lofty head-dre&s;&s;es, and were not &s;paring of rouge. The men wear diamonds, as well as the women. Their buttons, buckles, &s;word-hilts, and epaulets, are compo&s;ed of &s;everal rows of pearls; and a diamond &s;tar is &s;carce a di&s;tinction. This pa&s;&s;ion for jewels &s;eems to pervade the lower cla&s;s of people; for, even private families abound with them; and the wife of a common, Ru&s;&s;ian burgher, will appear, with a head-dre&s;s, or girdle of pearls and other pre|cious &s;tones, worth two or three hundred pounds.</P>
<P>At certain times, the Empre&s;s dines in public. On the 2d of December, &s;he gives an entertainment to the officers of the regiment, of which &s;he, as &s;overeign, is the colonel. At this time &s;he is dre&s;&s;ed in the uniform
<PB N="153" REF="161">
of the regiment, in a habit re&s;embling a riding-dre&s;s. They &s;it with her, and &s;he is very attentive to them. At another time, &s;he dines with the knights of the &s;e|veral orders, and is then habited like them. At the&s;e public dinners, &s;he hands each per&s;on, pre&s;ent, a gla&s;s of wine, who, after a low obei&s;ance, drinks it off. At the conclu&s;ion of this ceremony, which is generally about one o'clock, her maje&s;ty leads the way, into an adjoin|ing apartment. She takes her place in the middle of the table, and the officers are ranged on each &s;ide, ac|cording to their re&s;pective ranks. Her maje&s;ty, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, conde&s;cends to help the &s;oup her&s;elf, and pays, throughout, the greate&s;t attention to her gue&s;ts. After the repa&s;t, which u&s;ually la&s;ts about an hour, her maje&s;ty ri&s;es from table, and withdraws.</P>
<P>The Empre&s;s, on days of high ceremony, generally wears a crown of diamonds, of immen&s;e value; and appears with the ribbands of the order of St. Andrew and Merit, flung both over the &s;ame &s;houlder, with the collars of their orders, and the two &s;tars emblazoned, one above the other, upon her ve&s;t.</P>
<P>The palace of Peterhof, &s;ituated about 20 miles from the capital, has gardens, which are celebrated for their ta&s;te and elegance, and are the frequent &s;cenes of the mo&s;t &s;plendid entertainments. They have, from their number of <HI>jet d' eaus,</HI> &amp;c. been compared to tho&s;e of Ver&s;ailles: and indeed, in one re&s;pect, they are far &s;u|perior;
<PB N="154" REF="162">
for, tho&s;e of the latter only play, upon par|ticular occa&s;ions, while tho&s;e of Peterhof are perpe|tual. In the garden is an elegant pavilion, con&s;tructed by order of the Empre&s;s, when &s;he was Great Dutche&s;s. It contains eighteen apartments, each furni&s;hed in dif|ferent ta&s;tes; namely, the Greek, Turki&s;h, Chine&s;e, &amp;c. and is &s;ituated in the middle of a thick wood. Its approaches being circular, we have not the lea&s;t glimp&s;e, until we arrive at it; and, as it generally cau&s;es an emo|tion of &s;urprize, it has, for that rea&s;on, received the appellation of <HI>Ha!</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not detain the reader, with a de&s;cription of the &s;ilver dolphins, and gilded &s;tatues, which are &s;cattered in great profu&s;ion; but there are &s;ome few particulars, which, as they may afford entertainment, I mu&s;t not omit. The&s;e are, two gladiators, placed in a ba&s;on of water: they are repre&s;ented, not with the antient weapons, a &s;word and buckler, but with the more mo|dern in&s;truments of war, a brace of pi&s;tols; which, as they point to each other in threatening attitudes, the water gu&s;hes impetuou&s;ly from the barrels.</P>
<P>Among the numerous buildings the garden contains, is one erected by Peter I. and by him called <HI>Monplai&s;ir,</HI> the name by which it is now di&s;tingui&s;hed. He con|con&s;tructed this &s;mall hou&s;e, clo&s;e to the gulf of Fin|land, from a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that the air from the water, was the mo&s;t whole&s;ome for his con&s;titution. It is
<PB N="155" REF="163">
brick, of one &s;tory, and roofed with iron; the windows reach from the ground to the top, which, added to the length and lowne&s;s of the building, gives it the appear|ance of a green-hou&s;e. The habitable part, con&s;i&s;ts of a hall, and &s;ix &s;mall rooms; all furni&s;hed in the neate&s;t and plaine&s;t manner. The mantle-pieces are orna|mented with curious, old porcelain, which he greatly prized, as being brought into Ru&s;&s;ia, when the commu|nication was fir&s;t open with China. The bed-room is &s;mall, white-wa&s;hed, and the floor covered with a co|loured &s;ail-cloth. It contains a barrack-bed&s;tead, with|out curtains.

<P>The mountain of &s;ledges, or, as &s;ome travellers term it, the Flying Mountain, in the gardens of Peterhof, is a mo&s;t extraordinary building, and merits particular ob&s;ervation; and for which I &s;hall quote Mr. <HI>Coxe.</HI> &mdash; It &s;tands in the middle of an oblong area, enclo&s;ed by an open colonade, with a flat roof; is railed in, for the convenience of holding &s;pectators. The circumference of this colonade is, at lea&s;t, half a mile. In the mid|dle of the area, &s;tands the Flying Mountain, &s;tretching, nearly, from one end to the other. It is a wooden building, &s;upported upon pillars, repre&s;enting an un|even &s;urface of ground, or a mountain, compo&s;ed of three princpal a&s;cents, gradually dimini&s;hing in height, with an intermediate &s;pace, to re&s;emble vallies; from
<PB N="156" REF="164">
top to bottom, is a floored way, in which three pa|rallel grooves are formed. It is thus u&s;ed, a &s;mall carriage, containing one per&s;on, being placed in the center groove upon the highe&s;t point, goes with great rapidity down one hill; the velocity which it requires, in its de&s;cent, carries it up a &s;econd, and it continues to move, in a &s;imilar manner, until it arrives at the bot|tom of the area, where it rolls, for a con&s;iderable way, on the level &s;urface, and &s;tops before it attains the boundary. It is then placed in one of the &s;ide-grooves, and drawn up, by means of a cord, fixed to a windla&s;s. At the top of the mountain, is a hand&s;ome apartment, for the accommodation of the court, and principal no|bility. There is al&s;o room for many thou&s;and &s;pectators within the colonade, and upon its roof; but her pre&s;ent maje&s;ty does not &s;eem &s;o fond of this diver&s;ion, as the late empre&s;s. The&s;e elegant gardens are frequently illuminated in the mo&s;t &s;uperb manner.</P>
<P>The winter-palace at Peter&s;burgh, is built of brick, &s;tuccoed white, and was erected by the late empre&s;s, Elizabeth; it is very large, and very heavy. It is not yet quite fini&s;hed, like almo&s;t every thing el&s;e in Ru&s;&s;ia. The &s;ituation is very lively; on the banks of the Neva, and in the center of the town. Contiguous to it, is a &s;mall palace, built by the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s, called, <HI>The Hermitage,</HI> communicating with the palace, by means of a covered gallery. When her maje&s;ty re&s;ides in this part of the building, &s;he is in retreat, and there is
<PB N="157" REF="165">
no drawing-room, or court; from this it takes its ap|pellation; but bears no other re&s;emblance to a her|mitage, except in its name; the apartments being ex|tremely &s;pacious, and decorated in a &s;uperb &s;tile of regal magnificence. To this favourite &s;pot, the Em|pre&s;s u&s;ually repairs for an hour or two every day; and, on a Thur&s;day evening, gives a private ball and &s;upper to the principal per&s;ons who form her court; foreign mini&s;ters, and foreign noblemen, being &s;eldom invited. At this entertainment, all ceremony is &s;aid to be ba|ni&s;hed, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with that re&s;pect which is paid to a great &s;overeign. The attendance of &s;ervants is excluded, while the &s;upper, and various refre&s;hments, are pre&s;ented on &s;mall tables, which ri&s;e through trap-doors. There are two galleries of paintings, which have been lately purcha&s;ed, at an immen&s;e expence, in Italy.</P>
<P>A winter, and &s;ummer-garden, compri&s;ed within the &s;cite of the building, are &s;ingular curio&s;ities, and &s;uch as do not, perhaps, occur in any other palace in Eu|rope. The &s;ummer-garden, in the true A&s;iatick &s;tile, occupies the whole level top of the edifice. The winter-garden is entirely roofed, and &s;urrounded with gla&s;s-frames; it is an high and &s;pacious hot-hou&s;e, laid out in gravel-walks, ornamented with parterres of flow|ers, orange-trees, and other &s;hrubs; and peopled with &s;everal birds of &s;undry &s;orts, and various climates, flit|ting from tree to tree. This exhibits a mo&s;t plea&s;ing
<PB N="158" REF="166">
effect; and is wonderfully delightful, when contra&s;ted with the di&s;mal and dreary winter-&s;ea&s;on, in Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>Before I quit Peter&s;burgh, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that, from its low and mar&s;hy &s;ituation, it is much &s;ubject to inundations; which have, occa&s;ionally, ri&s;en &s;o high, as to threaten the town with a total &s;ubmer&s;ion. The&s;e floods are chiefly occa&s;ioned by a we&s;t, or &s;outh-we&s;t wind; which, blowing directly from the gulph, ob&s;tructs the current of the Neva, and cau&s;es a va&s;t accumulation of its waters; but the&s;e floods become le&s;s and le&s;s alarming, from the gradual rai&s;ing of the ground, by buildings, and other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>In the evening of the 9th of September, 1777, a mo&s;t violent &s;torm of wind, blowing at fir&s;t S. W. and after|wards W. rai&s;ed the Neva, and its various branches, to &s;o great a height, that, at five in the morning, the waters poured over the banks, and &s;uddenly overflow|ed the town, and va&s;t numbers of the people were drowned. The torrent ro&s;e, in &s;everal &s;treets, to the depth of four-feet-and-an-half, and over-turned, by its rapidity, various buildings and bridges. About &s;even, the wind &s;hifting to N. W. the flood fell as &s;uddenly; and, at mid-day, mo&s;t of the &s;treets, which, in the morning, could only be pa&s;&s;ed in boats, became dry. For a &s;hort time, the river ro&s;e ten feet &s;even inches above its ordinary level.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="167">About 20 miles from Peter&s;burgh, by water, lies the i&s;land Retu&s;ari, a long &s;lip of land, near 10 miles in circumference, and containing at pre&s;ent about 30,000 inhabitants, including the &s;ailors and garri&s;on; the former amounting to 12,000, the latter to 1,500 men. On the &s;outh-ea&s;tern extremity of this i&s;land is built the town of Cron&s;tadt, defended, towards the &s;ea, by wooden piers, projecting into the water; and, towards the land, by ramparts and ba&s;tions. It is a very &s;trag|gling place, and occupies, like all Ru&s;&s;ian towns, a larger &s;pace of ground than the number of dwellings &s;eem to require. This i&s;land was fortified for the &s;ecu|rity of the Ru&s;&s;ian fleet; for, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land, is the only pa&s;&s;age, for &s;hips of burthen, up to Peter&s;burgh, through a narrow channel.</P>
<P>It was in the fortre&s;s of Cron&s;tadt that <HI>Peter III.</HI> hoped to have &s;ecured him&s;elf at the time of the late revo|lution; but the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s, anticipating his inten|tion, had &s;ecured it; and <HI>Peter,</HI> not having the cou|rage to attempt to land, returned back to Oranien|baum, where re&s;igning all power into her hands, this mighty revolution was effected in a few hours, almo&s;t without any confu&s;ion or uproar. <HI>Peter</HI> was then &s;e|cured within the citadel; and on the ninth day con&s;e|quent to his &s;eizure, it was reported he had a di&s;order in his bowels, and, &s;oon after, his death was an|nounced.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="168">Mo&s;cow, of which I have already treated very fully in the &s;econd volume, is, in rank, the &s;econd city of this empire, though it was formerly the fir&s;t. It is &s;ituated in 55 degrees, 45 minutes, and 45 &s;econds of northern latitude. Here the chief nobles, who do not belong to the court of the Empre&s;s, re&s;ide; and here &s;upport a large number of retainers. They love to gratify their ta&s;te for a ruder, and more expen&s;ive mag|nificence, in the ancient &s;tyle of feudal grandeur; and are not, as at Peter&s;burgh, eclip&s;ed by the &s;uperior &s;plendor of the court.</P>
<P>There is a &s;ort of &s;avage and barbarous grandeur in their ta&s;te, which here appears in the edifices and pro|ductions of Athenian &s;culpture or architecture. The Empre&s;s has begun to erect a palace, which is de&s;igned to be two or three Engli&s;h miles in circumference. The city it&s;elf is an immen&s;e aggregate of villages; and the Mu&s;covite lords commonly go near forty of our miles to make morning vi&s;its to each other. From the windings of the river, and from many eminences which are covered with groves of fine, tall trees; and from nu|merous gardens and lawns that open to the water, the city has a mo&s;t plea&s;ing, airy appearance. In &s;hort, ac|cording to <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> it is a finer city than Peter&s;burgh.</P>
<P>Novogorod is one of the mo&s;t ancient cities in Ru&s;|&s;ia; and no place ever filled the mind with more me|lancholy ideas of fallen grandeur. <HI>Richard Chancellor,</HI>

who pa&s;&s;ed through it in 1554, in his way to Mo&s;cow, &s;ays, that, though in maje&s;ty, it is inferior to Mo&s;cow, in greatne&s;s it exceeds it. The commodiou&s;ne&s;s of the river makes it much frequented by merchants, and more famous than Mo&s;cow it&s;elf. In its mo&s;t flouri&s;hing condition, it contained at lea&s;t 400,000 &s;ouls; at pre|&s;ent, it contains &s;carcely 7000.</P>
<P>In 1570, under the reign of Ivan II. Novogorod experienced a downfall, from which it has never reco|vered; that monarch having di&s;covered a &s;ecret corre&s;|pondence between &s;ome of the principal inhabitants, and the king of Poland, relative to a &s;urrender of the city into his hands, inflicted the mo&s;t inhuman ven|geance upon them. During the &s;pace of five weeks, which the Court of Inquiry continued, upwards of 500, daily, fell victims to incen&s;ed de&s;poti&s;m. This bar|barous tran&s;action, and the &s;avage ferocity with which it was executed, equals, if not &s;urpa&s;&s;es, in cruelty, the ma&s;&s;acre at Stockholm, under Chri&s;tian II.</P>
<P>Although the &s;plendor of this once flouri&s;hing court, received a very con&s;iderable diminution by this horrid cata&s;trophe, and the &s;ub&s;equent oppre&s;&s;ions which the town experienced under that &s;anguinary prince, yet it was not totally ob&s;cured, until the foundation of Peter&s;burgh, to which favourite capital <HI>Peter the Great</HI> transferred all the commerce of the Baltic, which before centered in Novogorod. In 1611, the Swedes took it
<PB N="162" REF="170">
by &s;torm, but afterwards &s;urrendered it to the Mu&s;|covites. The town &s;tretches on both &s;ides of the Wolkof, a river of con&s;iderable depth and rapidity, and &s;omewhat broader than the Thames at Wind&s;or. This river &s;eparates the town into two divi&s;ions; which are united, by means of a bridge, partly wooden, and partly brick. The fir&s;t divi&s;ion, excepting the gover|nor's hou&s;e, differs only from the common villages, by a va&s;t number of brick churches and convents, which &s;tand melancholy monuments of its former magni|ficence; while half-cultivated fields, enclo&s;ed within high palli&s;adoes, and large &s;paces, covered with net|tles, atte&s;t its pre&s;ent de&s;olate condition. Towards its extremity, is erected a manufactory, at the Empre&s;s's expence, for ropes and &s;ails. The oppo&s;ite divi&s;ion, denominated, the quarter of St. Sophia, comprehends the fortre&s;s; which is of an irregularly oval form, and &s;urrounded with a high, brick wall, &s;trengthened with round and &s;quare towers. The fortre&s;s contains, the cathedral of St. Sophia, the old, archiepi&s;copal man|&s;ion, with its &s;tair-ca&s;e on the out&s;ide, part of a new palace, not yet fini&s;hed; and a few other brick build|ings; but, the remaining &s;pace, is a wa&s;te, over&s;pread with weeds and nettles, and covered with ruins.</P>
<P>The cathedral is, probably, one of the mo&s;t antient churches in Ru&s;&s;ia. It was begun in 1044 and com|pleted in 1051. It is a high, &s;quare building, with a gilded cupola, and four tin domes. In the in&s;ide of
<PB N="163" REF="171">
this cathedral, to which we enter through a pair of brazen gates, ornamented with various &s;criptural hi&s;to|ries, in alto-relievo, are 12 ma&s;&s;y pillars, white-wa&s;hed, which, as well as the walls, are thickly covered with the repre&s;entations of our Saviour, the Virgin Mary, and various other &s;aints. Some of the&s;e paintings are of very high antiquity. Several princes of the ducal fa|mily of Ru&s;&s;ia, are interred within this cathedral; the mo&s;t ancient of who&s;e &s;epulchres are of carved wood, gilt and &s;ilvered, and &s;urrounded with iron rails; the others are, of brick and mortar. Within the &s;anctu|ary, the walls are covered with curious, Mo&s;aic compart|ments, of coar&s;e workman&s;hip, and &s;eemingly very ancient.</P>

<P>Mo&s;cow is afflicted with very frequent and dreadful fires. The account of that in May, 1752, is immen&s;e; they mention 13,000 hou&s;es, which is hardly credible: and, what is remarkable, that fire, in two hour's time, was carried to the extent of two Engli&s;h miles. But, by a decree of the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;enate, the wood-hou&s;es are now limited to certain quarters of the city; and, in all other places, they were ordered to be rebuilt with brick and &s;tone. There is a very con&s;iderable manufacture at Mo&s;cow, of various hemp-fabricks, which employs &s;ome thou&s;ands of looms, and many thou&s;ands of peo|ple. This city is almo&s;t in the centre of the mo&s;t cul|tivated parts of the empire; and is, therefore, inde|pendent of various other advantages it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, better &s;ituated for the metropolis of the empire, than Peter&s;|burgh. Founding that city, and making it the &s;eat of foreign commerce and naval power, was an admirable
<PB N="165" REF="173">
exertion of genius; but, the &s;eat of government, &s;hould always have been at Mo&s;cow.&mdash;For any further par|ticulars, I mu&s;t refer my readers to the beginning of the &s;econd volume.</P>
<P>Kiovia, or Kiof, the capital of the Ukraine, is al&s;o one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cities of Ru&s;&s;ia; a place well-known in the hi&s;tory of that empire; which, though, compared to its former grandeur, it has been reduced to a low &s;tate, by many revolutions, yet it has now recovered all tho&s;e ancient blows, and is well built, of brick and &s;tone. The &s;treets are wide, &s;trait, and well-paved. It has a bi&s;hop, a noble cathedral (much of it lately rebuilt), and 11 other churches. It has 40,000 inhabitants, and is &s;trongly fortified. The Nieper is here a noble river, has &s;everal larger rivers falling into it, after wa&s;hing &s;ome of the riche&s;t provinces of Po|land; and enables this town to carry on a very con&s;i|derable commerce. It is the grand magazine of all the commodities of the Ukraine; particularly hemp and flax, which, in this fine province, are rai&s;ed in greater quantities, and of a better quality, than in any other part of Europe. The Ukraine is the riche&s;t pro|vince in the Ru&s;&s;ian empire; and lies between the Nieper and the Don. It is, on an average, 250 miles long, from ea&s;t to we&s;t; and 140 broad, from north to &s;outh. Part uf it was formerly a province of Poland; and, the re&s;t, an independent &s;overeignty, under a Tartar prince: but the whole, now, is a mere
<PB N="166" REF="174">
province of Ru&s;&s;ia, inhabited by Circa&s;&s;ian traders; and is much the riche&s;t acqui&s;ition the Crown has made.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the Ukraine are not va&s;&s;als, but chiefly little freehold-farmers, and are the be&s;t hu&s;band|men in all Ru&s;&s;ia. Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> &s;ays, he thinks he never &s;aw &s;uch deep ploughing, as the&s;e pea&s;ants give their grounds; he mea&s;ured nine inches perpendicular, after a plough drawn by four oxen. Their ploughs are very well con&s;tructed, and are made wholly of iron, without wheels. They have very noble crops of cab|bages, of a red &s;ort, that grow to the weight of 25 or 30lb. with which they feed their cattle. An acre of them will winter four or five large oxen. They have al&s;o whole fields of potatoes, which yield from 12 to 1500 bu&s;hels per acre; numbers of them, as large as the body of a quart bottle: they plant them, as we do, in &s;lices. They grow al&s;o tobacco. In &s;hort, it is this di&s;trict which rai&s;es nine-tenths of the hemp and flax which we import, at &s;uch a va&s;t expence, from Ru&s;&s;ia. The &s;oil is a very rich, deep mould, between a loam and a dry clay; but without any of that tenacious thick|ne&s;s, &s;o di&s;agreeable in &s;tirring in our clay-lands in England.</P>
<P>Riga is another, and the next con&s;iderable place of trade to Peter&s;burgh. It is the metropolis of Livonia, and &s;tands very advantageou&s;ly for commerce, about 10
<PB N="167" REF="175">
miles from the mouth of the river Duna, in the Baltic &s;ea; which river extending a great way into Poland and Ru&s;&s;ia, brings down immen&s;e quantities of commodities, which are there exported. More than 800 &s;ail of &s;hips are loaded here, in a year, from 150 to 400 tons bur|then, half of them Engli&s;h. This province was taken from the Swedes, in 1710; and, of all the Ru&s;&s;ian conque&s;ts, it is one of the greate&s;t, on account of its products, ports, and &s;ituation. It is nearly a &s;quare of 200 miles every way, and contains better than 25 millions of acres, and near 12 millions of people. Half the lands are under profitable cultivation; and its an|nual product is e&s;timated at 13 millions &s;teriing.</P>
<P>Riga it&s;elf is inve&s;ted with deep, barren &s;ands, and has nothing agreeable about it. It is &s;urrounded with for|tifications; the hou&s;es are all high, the &s;treets very narrow, ill paved, and very dirty; and contains about 16,000 inhabitants. But the bridge over the river is one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular and &s;urpri&s;ing in Europe. It is 900 paces long, and far exceeds the bridge at Rouen. It con&s;i&s;ts of tran&s;ver&s;e beams of timber, jointed together, and ri&s;es and falls with the tide. It is erected in &s;pring always, when the river is free from ice; and removed in November, before the fro&s;t &s;ets in.</P>
<P>Ru&s;&s;ian Finland is a province of Ru&s;&s;ia which for|merly belonged to the Swedes, and which they are now contending for. This province retains mo&s;t of its
<PB N="168" REF="176">
ancient privileges; its own civil and criminal courts of ju&s;tice: but their puni&s;hments do not extend to death. The pea&s;ants &s;peak the Fin language; but the inhabit|ants of the towns, Swedi&s;h and German: the Lutheran religion is the e&s;tabli&s;hed one; but, the Greek church, has been lately introduced. It is &s;o un-peopled, un-cultivated, and un-fertile, that 40 Engli&s;h miles of land have been lately &s;old for 400<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling.</P>
<P>Wiburgh is the capital of this province, is a fortified town, and contains about 9,000 people; but the exports of the place, in planks, tallow, pitch and tar, load an|nually 100 &s;ail of &s;hips, the greater part of which are Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Archangel is another port of the Ru&s;&s;ians, on the North Sea. It is a &s;mall town, almo&s;t on the mouth of the Duiria, about 300 miles from Peter&s;burgh, where the river, which is very broad and deep, forms an ex|cellent harbour. It was formerly the re&s;idence of the Briti&s;h factors, till they removed to Peter&s;burgh. In tho&s;e days, it was not uncommon to &s;ee 4 or 500 &s;ail of &s;hips in the harbour, at one time; but the trade be|ing transferred to Peter&s;burgh, it is now a poor place, of very little re&s;ort; and the buildings contain nothing worthy of notice. They have a cathedral, and an arch|bi&s;hop of the Greek church; but every thing looks on the decline.</P>

<P>AMONG their various amu&s;ements, that of their ma&s;querades, and illuminations, in the gardens at Peterhof, de&s;erve to be particularly noticed. They are given, by the Empre&s;s, upon a great occa&s;ion; and convey a mo&s;t exten&s;ive proof of the &s;plendor and magnificence of the Ru&s;&s;ian court.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="178">The ma&s;querade is rather a <HI>bal par&eacute; en domino;</HI> as there are very few or no fancy-dre&s;&s;es, nor is any cha|racter &s;upported.

<P>The illuminations in the garden, are far beyond any &s;een el&s;ewhere; for in this, as well as in fire-works, the Ru&s;&s;ians excel every nation in Europe. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, two prodigious arcades of fire are extended in front of the palace; the canal, which reaches to the gulph of Finland, has been illuminated on both &s;ides, the view terminating by a rock, lighted in the in&s;ide, and affording a mo&s;t beautiful effect; from either &s;ide of the canal, long, arched walks, illuminated; and, beyond the&s;e, in the woods, hanging fe&s;toons of lamps, differently coloured. All the <HI>jets d' eaux</HI> play|ing; artificial ca&s;cades, with the water tumbling from one declivity to another, and, under each, lights, &s;o artfully di&s;po&s;ed, as, at once, to amu&s;e and &s;urpri&s;e the &s;pectator: be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;ummer-hou&s;es, pyramids, and temples of flame; and, beyond all, the Imperial yatchts, appearing in the &s;ame brilliant and dazzling ornaments.</P>
<P>Two or three times, in the winter, there are ma&s;que|rades at the court at Peter&s;burgh, to which per&s;ons of
<PB N="171" REF="179">
all ranks are admitted. A magnificent &s;uite of 20 apart|ments is opened upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, all hand&s;omely illuminated. From 7 to 8000 tickets are di&s;tributed; and Mr. <HI>Coxe</HI> &s;ays, that at one, at which he was, he &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that number were actually pre&s;ent. One of the apartments, a large, oblong room, the &s;ame in which the common balls at court are held, has a &s;pace in the middle, enclo&s;ed with a low railing, appropriat|ed to the nobility who dance. A mo&s;t elegant &s;aloon, of an oval form, nearly as big as the rotunda at Rane|lagh, but without any &s;upport in the middle, is allotted for the dances of the burghers, and other per&s;ons, who have not been pre&s;ented at court. The remaining rooms, in which tea, and other refre&s;hments, are &s;erved, are filled with card-tables. About &s;even the Empre&s;s u&s;ually makes her appearance, at the head of a &s;uperb quadrille, con&s;i&s;ting of eight ladies, led by as many gentlemen. Her Maje&s;ty, and her attendants, are al|ways, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, mo&s;t &s;umptuou&s;ly appa|relled; and, as u&s;ual, with a profu&s;e decoration of dia|monds. The Empre&s;s, after walking round the &s;aloon two or three times, &s;its down to cards in an adjoining room, where the company flock in crouds, without di&s;tinction, and arrange them&s;elves, as they can find admittance, round the table, at a re&s;pectful di&s;tance. About eleven the Empre&s;s u&s;ually withdraws.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, when the court is out of town, there are &s;carce any public &s;pectacles at Peter&s;|burgh, except at the Imperial palace, where a French
<PB N="172" REF="180">
and Ru&s;&s;ian comedy are performed generally once a week. The &s;eats are adju&s;ted by rank, and no money is paid for admittance, as it is the Empre&s;s's own amu&s;ement, and limited to people of condition. Box|ing-matches are very favorite diver&s;ions among the common people; they generally a&s;&s;emble, 3 or 400, and divide them&s;elves into two parties, each of which chu&s;es a chief, who calls out the combatants, and pits them again&s;t each other. They do not &s;trip, as with us, and have on thick, leathern gloves; from the &s;tiff|ne&s;s of the leather, they can &s;carcely double their fi&s;ts, &s;o that many of them &s;trike open-handed. Their atti|tudes are very different from tho&s;e u&s;ed by boxers in England; they advance the left foot and &s;ide; &s;tretch the left arm towards the adver&s;ary, in order to repel his blows, and keep the right arm &s;winging at &s;ome di&s;tance from the other. They generally &s;trike, in a circular direction, at the face and head, never attack the brea&s;t or &s;ides, and &s;eem to have no notion of aim|ing a blow directly forward. When any combatant fells his antagoni&s;t to the ground, he is declared victor, and the conte&s;t between that pair immediately cea&s;es. Their mode of fighting prevents any mi&s;chief from its exertion; nor do we, therefore, &s;eldom &s;ee any of tho&s;e fractures and contu&s;ions, in which boxing-matches in England &s;o frequently terminate.</P>
<P>The tournament is a favourite diver&s;ion in Ru&s;&s;ia. I &s;hall de&s;cribe one from Mr. <HI>Coxe</HI>'s Travels, at which he was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="181">"His Imperial Highne&s;s the Great Duke, who two or three times in a week takes this diver&s;ion, and eleven of his nobles, dre&s;&s;ed in uniforms of buff and gold, and armed with a lance, &s;word and pi&s;tols, were a&s;&s;embled at nine o'clock, although it was as yet du&s;k. The Great Duke drew them up by pairs; and, upon the &s;ound of the trumpet, he and the knights imme|diately mounted their hor&s;es, and retired in due order without the rails. Two rings were &s;u&s;pended on oppo|&s;ite &s;ides of the wall, on each &s;ide of the manage. At each corner was a Moor's head, of pa&s;teboard; or an apple, fixed upon a pole; and, between them, two heads, with a &s;quib in their mouths: the&s;e were all placed upon &s;tands, almo&s;t as high as a man on hor&s;e|back, and at &s;ome paces from the wall: at each end was al&s;o a helmet of pa&s;teboard, rai&s;ed upon a &s;tand, about a foot from the ground, and about four from the wall. The two judges, with Lord Herbert and my|&s;elf, who were the only &s;pectators, took our &s;tation on the out&s;ide of the rail. Upon a &s;econd &s;ignal from the trumpet, two knights entered at oppo&s;ite ends of the manage. A band of mu&s;ic played a quick air, while each knight, galloping his hor&s;e to the right, and making a vault, &s;aluted with their lances at the &s;ame time; then, continuing their cour&s;e round the manage, each ran with his lance, fir&s;t at the rings &s;u&s;pended from the walls, and next at the Moor's head; after which they deli|vered their lances, as they went on, to their &s;ervants on foot. The knights then drew their pi&s;tols, and, each
<PB N="174" REF="182">
making a &s;econd vault round the other's head, di&s;|charged them, in order to &s;et fire to the &s;quib; then pur&s;uing their cour&s;e round the manage, they drew their &s;words, and, making a third vault round the apple, endeavoured to &s;trike it to the ground. They fini&s;hed their career by &s;tooping down as they galloped by, thru&s;ting their &s;words through the helmets; then poi&s;ing them in the air, they met in the middle, and, riding towards the judge, &s;aluted him; related the at|tempts in which they had &s;ucceeded, and demanded their prizes. The prize was about four &s;hillings for each atchievement; and an equal value was paid for every failure. The whole was performed on a conti|nued gallop, and always to the right. In running at the ring, the head, or the helmet, it is e&s;teemed ho|norable to put the hor&s;e into full career, which increa&s;es the difficulty. The judge, having be&s;towed the re|wards, and taken the forfeits, ordered the two knights to retire. The trumpets again &s;ounding, two others made their appearance, and performed the &s;ame man|oeuvres. This exerci&s;e was repeated twice by each pair of knights; the whole troop then entered at the &s;ame time, marched, charged, formed, drew, re|turned their &s;words, and di&s;mounted, by word of com|mand from the Great Duke. At the conclu&s;ion they adjourned to the fire, chocolate was brought in, and, after a &s;hort conver&s;ation, the Great Duke bowed, and retired."</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="183">Hawking, and cour&s;ing with greyhounds, is al&s;o very much a favourite amu&s;ement of the Ru&s;&s;ians. Before the days of <HI>Peter the Great,</HI> they were barbarous, ig|norant, and very much addicted to drunkenne&s;s. No fewer than 4,000 brandy-&s;hops have been reckoned in Mo&s;cow. Not only the common people, but many of the boyars, or nobles, lived in a continual &s;tate of idle|ne&s;s and intoxication; and the mo&s;t complete objects of mi&s;ery and barbarity pre&s;ented them&s;elves in the &s;treets; while the court of Mo&s;cow was by far the mo&s;t &s;plendid of any upon the globe. The Ru&s;&s;ians, before the time of <HI>Peter,,</HI> had no places of public diver&s;ion; and they entertained a &s;overeign contempt for all im|provements of the mind. At pre&s;ent, a French or Engli&s;h gentleman, though a fine day does not tempt him to take a walk, and he has few rural &s;cenes to en|chant his eyes, may make a &s;hift to live as comfortably and &s;ociably in Ru&s;&s;ia, as in mo&s;t other parts of Eu|rope; and, if he lives genteely at Peter&s;burgh, he is &s;ure to get ea&s;ily into the be&s;t of company.</P>
<P>The &s;toves they make u&s;e of diffu&s;e a more equal and genial warmth than our grates and chimnies. Their polite a&s;&s;emblies have, &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s, been put under proper regulations; and few of their ancient u&s;ages remain, but &s;uch as are of public utility, and adapted to the nature of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="184">The Czarina and grandees, according to Captain <HI>Perry</HI>'s account, dre&s;&s;ed after the mo&s;t &s;uperb, A&s;iatic manner; and their magnificence exceeded every idea that can be conceived, from modern examples: and the <HI>Earl of Carli&s;le,</HI> in the account of his emba&s;&s;y, &s;ays, That he could &s;ee nothing but gold and precious &s;tones in the robes of the Czar, and his courtiers. The ma|nufactures, however, of the&s;e, and all other luxuries, were carried on by Italians, Germans, and other fo|reigners.</P>
<P><HI>Peter,</HI> who &s;aw the bulk of his &s;ubjects, at his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, little better than bea&s;ts of burthen, to &s;upport the pomp of the court, forced his great men to lay a&s;ide their long robes, which hung down to the mid|dle of the &s;mall of their legs, and was gathered, and laid in plaits upon their hips, little differing from women's petticoats; and appear after the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion. To compell this, he adopted different methods; one of which, from its oddity, I &s;hall mention. He had cloaths, made according to the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion, hung up at all the gates of the city of Mo&s;cow, and i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, that all per&s;ons (excepting the common pea&s;ants, who brought goods and provi&s;ions into the city), &s;hould have their cloaths according to tho&s;e pat|terns: and, in di&s;obedience to it, &s;hould either pay a fine of twenty pence Engli&s;h, or be compelled to kneel down at the gates of the city, and have their coats cut off even with the ground, when they knelt; in con|&s;equence
<PB N="177" REF="185">
of which, many hundreds coats were cut; and, as it was done in good humour, it occa&s;ioned mirth among the people, and &s;oon broke the cu&s;tom of their wearing long coats. The women, but more particularly the ladies about court, were al&s;o ordered to reform the fa&s;hion of their cloaths; and a reformation of <HI>Peter</HI>'s, in another point, the &s;ooner reconciled them to this.</P>
<P>It had been an invariable cu&s;tom in Ru&s;&s;ia, at all entertainments, for the women not to be admitted into the &s;ight or conver&s;ation of men; and, the very hou&s;es of per&s;ons of any quality, or fa&s;hion, were built with an entrance for the women apart; and they u&s;ed to be kept up &s;eparate by them&s;elves. But the Czar, being not only willing to introduce Engli&s;h habits, but to make them more particularly plea&s;ing to the Ru&s;s ladies, made an order that, from thence-forward, at all weddings, and at other public entertainments, the women, as well as the men, &s;hould be invited, but in an Engli&s;h-fa&s;hioned dre&s;s; and that they &s;hould then be entertained in the &s;ame room with the men.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances did the reform in their manners of dre&s;s take place; which has improved, with time; &s;o that people of di&s;tinction now dre&s;s, as nearly as the climate will admit, after the Engli&s;h and French manner.

In &s;ummer, the men will often wear coats and &s;hirts only, and trow&s;ers, but always &s;wathe their legs. Their hair they &s;uffer to hang down over the forehead, and cut it &s;hort in the poll. Their caps, or hats, are round, with very high crowns, lined with fur, and cover their ears and neck, as well as their heads. They wear &s;a&s;hes round their wai&s;t; and double gloves, one of woollen, and the other of leather, which take in the hand without any di&s;tinction, except the thumb; and the&s;e are al&s;o an e&s;&s;ential part of their cloathing.

<P>It had been the manner of the Ru&s;&s;ians to wear long beards; but <HI>Peter,</HI> de&s;irous of making them like other Europeans, levied a tax upon his &s;ubjects, excepting only the prie&s;ts, for the wearing of their beards; but, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e rigorous edicts, i&s;&s;ued by <HI>Peter,</HI> the men, among the lower cla&s;s, univer&s;ally wear the beard.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Wraxall</HI> &s;ays, He was a &s;pectator of one of their cu&s;toms, which not a little &s;urpri&s;ed him; that of a promi&s;cuous bathing of more than 200 per&s;ons of both &s;exes. There are &s;everal of the&s;e public bathing-places in Peter&s;burgh; where every one pays a few copecs, or halfpence, for admittance; and bathe, once or twice a-week. There are, indeed, &s;eparate places for the men and women; but they &s;eem quite regard|le&s;s of this di&s;tinction, and &s;it, or bathe, promi&s;cuou&s;ly, quite naked. They go fir&s;t into a room, heated to &s;uch a degree, that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to breathe in it; and, after &s;taying in this room, till they are in a &s;trong per&s;piration, either plunge into the cold water of the

river Neva, or throw a quantity of cold water over them, from little buckets, kept for the purpo&s;e.&mdash; This may harden a Ru&s;&s;ian con&s;titution, but would ill agree with an Engli&s;h one.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Coxe</HI> is more particular in de&s;cribing the&s;e baths, which are general all over Ru&s;&s;ia. The common bath|ing-hou&s;es are wooden buildings, of one room, clo&s;e to &s;ome river, with &s;mall windows, like cottage-windows. This room, within, is provided with ranges of broad benches, placed, like &s;teps, one above another, almo&s;t to the cieling. An old woman is generally the attend|ant of this room. On the&s;e benches, you will &s;ee num|bers of per&s;ons naked; &s;ome lying on the benches, &s;ome &s;itting, others &s;tanding; &s;ome wa&s;hing their bodies with &s;oap, others rubbing them&s;elves with &s;mall branches of oak-leaves, tied together like a rod; &s;ome pouring hot water on their heads, others cold water; whil&s;t the woman, having made a fire under an arch of granite-&s;tone, about four feet high, &s;prinkles water over this arch, when it is &s;ufficiently heated, and the vapour ari&s;ing therefrom, heats the room almo&s;t beyond bear|ing. Some, exhau&s;ted thus by the heat, go out and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd in the open air, or throw them&s;elves into the river, to cool them. When a per&s;on goes &s;ingly to one of the&s;e baths, this old woman, having heated the room, &s;trips the bather, lays him on the bench, and lathers him with &s;oap, from head to foot, then wa&s;hes him, and dries him with napkins. This operation, renders
<PB N="181" REF="190">
the body in&s;en&s;ible to cold, even in the colde&s;t weather; and communicates a glow of warmth, that continues the whole night.</P>
<P>In the month of December I was witne&s;s, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> to a very &s;ingular entertainment, given to the public, by a Ru&s;&s;ian, who had acquired a large for|tune by farming, four years only, and vending &s;pirituous liquors. On &s;urrendering his contract, he gave, as a proof of his gratitude to the lower cla&s;s of people, by whom he had enriched him&s;elf, a fea&s;t, in the garden of the &s;ummer-palace, which was announced by hand-bills, di&s;tributed through the city. A large, &s;emi-cir|cular table, was covered with all kinds of provi&s;ions, piled in different &s;hapes, and in the greate&s;t profu&s;ion. Large &s;lices of bread and caviare, dried &s;turgeon, carp, and other fi&s;h, were ranged to a great height, in the form of pent-hou&s;es and pyramids, and garni&s;hed with craw-fi&s;h, onions and pickles. In different parts of the garden, were rows of ca&s;ks, full of &s;pirituous liquors; and &s;till larger ve&s;&s;els, of wines, beer, and quas. Among the decorations, was the repre&s;entation of an immen&s;e whale in pa&s;teboard, covered with cloth, and gold and &s;ilver brocade, and filled within with bread, dried fi&s;h, and other provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>All &s;orts of games and diver&s;ions were exhibited for the amu&s;ement of the populace. At the extremity of the grounds, was a large &s;quare of ice, well &s;wept, for
<PB N="182" REF="191">
the &s;caters; near which, were two machines, like the &s;winging vehicles at Bartholomew-fair. One of the&s;e machines con&s;i&s;ted of two cro&s;s beams, fixed horizontally to a pole, in the center, by means of a pivot; from the ends, hung four &s;ledges, in which the people &s;eated them&s;elves, and were turned round with great velocity; the other had four wooden hor&s;es, &s;u&s;pended from the beams, and their riders were whirled round, in the like manner, as their rivals in the &s;ledges. Beyond the&s;e, were two ice-hills, &s;uch as I have de&s;cribed below, and for the &s;ame diver&s;ion. Two poles, above 20 feet high, were al&s;o erected, with colours flying; and, at the top of each, was placed a piece of money, as a prize for tho&s;e who could &s;warm up and &s;eize it. The poles being rubbed with oil, &s;oon froze, in this &s;evere climate; and, of cour&s;e, many and tedious were the attempts of the various competitors, in this &s;lipping a&s;cent to fame. The &s;cene was lively and gay; for above 40,000 per&s;ons, of both &s;exes, were a&s;&s;embled on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It had been pre-concerted, that, on the firing of a rocket, the people were to drink a gla&s;s of &s;pirituous liquor; and, upon the di&s;charge of a &s;econd, to begin the repa&s;t. But the impatience of the populace anti|cipated the nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;econd &s;ignal; and the whole multitude was &s;oon, and at once, in motion. The whale was the chief object of contention; within a few minutes, it was entirely dive&s;ted of its gaudy trappings,
<PB N="183" REF="192">
which became the &s;poils of its &s;ucce&s;sful invaders. They had no &s;ooner flea'd it of its drapery, and &s;ecured the fragments of rich brocades, than they rent him into a thou&s;and pieces, in order to &s;eize the provi&s;ions with which its in&s;ide were &s;tored. The remaining people, who were too numerous to be all engaged about the whale, were bu&s;y in uncovering the pent-hou&s;es, and pulling down the pyramids, in conveying provender with one hand to their mouths, and the other to their pockets. Others crowded round the ca&s;ks and hog&s;heads, and, with great wooden ladles, lapped ince&s;&s;antly wine, beer, and &s;pirits. The confu&s;ion and riot which &s;oon &s;ucceeded, is better conceived than de&s;cribed. The evening was clo&s;ed with a &s;uperb illumination of the gardens, and a magnificent fire-work.</P>
<P>But, the con&s;equences of this fea&s;t, were dreadful. The cold had &s;uddenly increa&s;ed with &s;uch violence, that <HI>Fahrenheit</HI>'s thermometer, which, at mid-day, &s;tood only at 4, &s;unk, towards the clo&s;e of the evening, to 15 below the freezing point; con&s;equently, many intox|icated per&s;ons were frozen to death; not a few fell a &s;acrifice to drunken quarrels; and others, were robbed and murdered, in the more retired parts of the city, as they were returning home late. From a compari&s;on of the various reports, at lea&s;t 400 per&s;ons lo&s;t their lives, on this melancholy occa&s;ion. Murders u&s;ed to be frequent in Peter&s;burgh; but the police is now &s;o well regulated, that we &s;eldom hear of one. Among
<PB N="184" REF="193">
other parts of the police, no apothecary dares &s;ell a me|dicine, unle&s;s a regular pre&s;cription is brought him, &s;igned by a phy&s;ician&mdash;a law very beneficial to the faculty, and not without its u&s;e. Another regulation here, not without its advantages, though trouble&s;ome, is, that no &s;tranger can quit the capital, to pa&s;s the frontiers, without having been fir&s;t adverti&s;ed in all the public papers, for 10 days preceding his departure, let his bu&s;ine&s;s, or his affairs, be ever &s;o urgent. Peter&s;burgh, however, being no thoroughfare, the in|convenience is not &s;o great as one would &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more lively and diver&s;ified than the winter-&s;cenes upon the Neva. Many carriages and &s;ledges, and numberle&s;s foot &mdash; pa&s;&s;engers, perpetually cro&s;&s;ing it, afford a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of moving ob|jects; and the ice is al&s;o covered with different groupes of people, di&s;per&s;ed, or gathered together, and variou&s;ly employed, as fancy leads them. In one part, we &s;ee &s;everal long areas, railed off, for the purpo&s;e of &s;cat|ing; a little further, an enclo&s;ure, wherein a nobleman is training his hor&s;es, and teaching them the various evolutions of the managed. In another part, the crowd are &s;pectators of what is called a &s;ledge-race. The cour&s;e is an oblong &s;pace, about the length of a mile, and &s;ufficiently broad to turn a carriage. It can hardly be called a race, for there is only a &s;ingle &s;ledge, drawn by two hor&s;es; and, the whole art of the driver, con|&s;i&s;ts in making the &s;haft-hor&s;e trot as fa&s;t as he can, whil&s;t the other is pu&s;hed into a gallop.</P>

<P><PB N="185" REF="195">The ice-hills I have mentioned, are exceedingly common, and afford a perpetual fund of amu&s;ement to the populace. They are in imitation of the Flying-Mountain, at the palace of Peterhof; and are con|&s;tructed in the following manner:&mdash;A &s;caffolding is rai&s;ed upon the river, about 30 feet high, with a land|ing-place on the top, the a&s;cent to which is by a lad|der. From this top, a &s;loping plain of boards, about four yards broad, and 30 yards long, de&s;cends to the &s;urface to the river, &s;upported by &s;trong uprights, or poles, gradually decrea&s;ing in height; and its &s;ides de|fended by a parapet of planks. On the&s;e boards are laid &s;quare pieces of ice, about four inches thick, which, being fir&s;t &s;moothed with an axe, and laid clo&s;e to each other, are then &s;prinkled with water. By the&s;e means they unite, and adhering to the boards, immediately form an inclined plain of pure ice. From the bottom of this plain, the &s;now is cleared away, for the length of 200 yards, and the breadth of four yards. The level end of the river, and the &s;ides of this cour&s;e, as well as the &s;ides and top of the &s;caffolding, are orna|mented with firs and pines. Each per&s;on being pro|vided with a &s;ledge, re&s;embling our butcher's tray, mounts the ladder, and, when on the top of the &s;caf|fold, &s;eats him&s;elf in this &s;ledge, or tray, at the upper end of the inclined plane, down which he &s;lides with con&s;iderable rapidity, poi&s;ing it as he goes down; when the velocity acquired by the de&s;cent, carries it on above 100 yards, on the level ice below. At the end of this
<PB N="186" REF="196">
cour&s;e, there is a &s;imilar ice-hill, nearly parallel to to the former, which begins where the other ends; &s;o that the per&s;on immediately mounts again, and glides down as on the fir&s;t, and &s;o on; and this diver&s;ion he continues, as long as he plea&s;es. The difficulty of this pa&s;time con&s;i&s;ts in &s;teering and balancing the &s;ledge, as it is hurried down the inclined plane; for, if the per&s;on in it, does not &s;it &s;teady, but totters, through inad|vertency, or fear, he is liable to be overthrown, and runs no &s;mall ri&s;que of breaking his limbs, if not his neck&punc; The boys, al&s;o, will &s;cate down this hill, on one &s;cate; and are better able to poi&s;e them&s;elves on one leg, than on two. The&s;e ice-hills exhibit a plea&s;ing appearance on the river, as well from the trees with which they are or|namented, as from the moving objects, which, at par|ticular times of the day, are &s;liding down, without in|termi&s;&s;ion.</P>

They u&s;ually rai&s;e the whole hou&s;e, without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a &s;aw; the axe, or hatchet, being their chief in&s;trument. They fini&s;h the &s;hell and roof of the hou&s;e, before they cut out the windows, which are merely openings, a few inches &s;quare, clo&s;ed with &s;liding &s;hut|ters; and the door is generally &s;o low, as not to admit a middle-&s;ized man, without &s;tooping. Sometimes, though rarely, the&s;e cottages con&s;i&s;t of two &s;tories; in which ca&s;e, they make the lower apartment a kind of &s;tore-room, and live in the upper, mounting to it by a ladder. In the villages, the &s;cite of the hou&s;es is ge|nerally an oblong &s;quare, &s;urrounding an area, enclo&s;ed with a high, wooden wall, with a penthou&s;e roof; the whole re&s;embling a large barn. In one angle of this enclo&s;ure, &s;tands the hou&s;e, fronting the &s;treet, with the &s;tair-ca&s;e (where there are two &s;tories) on the out&s;ide, the door opening underneath the penthou&s;e roof.</P>

<P>The backwardne&s;s of the Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ants, in all the mechanical arts, when compared with tho&s;e of other nations, is vi&s;ible to every one. Near Peter&s;burgh, they are &s;omewhat better furni&s;hed with the conveniences of life, and their cottages are rather better con&s;tructed; but &s;till, their progre&s;s towards civilization, is very in|con&s;iderable. I will mention one in&s;tance, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> becau&s;e it will &s;hew, into what a wretched &s;tate of ig|norance, the common cla&s;s of people are &s;till plunged. In many families, the father marries the &s;on, whil&s;t a

boy of &s;even, eight or nine years old, to a girl of a more advanced age; in order, as it is &s;aid, to procure able-bodied women for dome&s;tic &s;ervices. He cohabits with this per&s;on, now become his daughter-in-law, and fre|quently has &s;everal children by her; &s;o that, in &s;ome cottages, there are two mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of a family; one, the pea&s;ant's real wife, who is old enough to be his mother; and the other, nominally, the &s;on's wife; but, in reality, the father's concubine.</P>
<P>Certain pea&s;ants, called <HI>Yam&s;hics,</HI> are obliged to fur|ni&s;h hor&s;es, at a fixed rate, for travelling, and are allowed particular privileges for &s;o doing; namely, exemptions from the poll-tax, or &s;erving as &s;oldiers: but, not|with&s;tanding the&s;e immunities, the price for each hor&s;e, being but from one halfpenny Engli&s;h to three half-pence, for each ver&s;t, or three-quarters of a mile, they produce their hor&s;es with great reluctance. The in&s;tant a traveller demands a fre&s;h &s;upply of hor&s;es, the Yam|&s;hics a&s;&s;emble, in crowds, and frequently wrangle and quarrel to &s;uch a degree, as to afford great amu&s;ement to one not impatient to &s;et off. An hour is often &s;pent in &s;uch di&s;putes; and the po&s;t-ma&s;ter is frequently ob|liged to &s;ettle them, by obliging the Yam&s;hics to draw lots, who &s;hall furni&s;h the hor&s;es. The only mode of travelling with comfort, is, by having a Ru&s;s &s;oldier with you, which can be procured with the pa&s;s-port. This &s;oldier, immediately on his arrival at the po&s;t-hou&s;e, in&s;tead of attending to the arguments of the
<PB N="191" REF="201">
Yam&s;hics, or waiting for the mediation of the po&s;t-ma&s;ter, &s;ummarily decides the bu&s;ine&s;s, by the <HI>argu|mentum baculinum,</HI> or, the powerful interpo&s;ition of the cudgel.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants act in capacity of coachmen and po&s;|tilions. They always harne&s;s four hor&s;es a-brea&s;t; and, commonly, put eight, and &s;ometimes ten to a carriage; the &s;tages being generally from 20 to 30 miles long, and the roads extremely bad. They &s;eldom u&s;e either boots, or &s;addles; and have no kind of &s;tirrup, but a rope, doubled, and thrown acro&s;s the hor&s;e's back. Each hor&s;e is equipped with a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">affle-bridle, &s;eldom put into the mouth, but hanging loo&s;e under it. Their general method of driving, is by &s;tarts and bounds, not an even pace, &s;eldom trotting their hor&s;es, but often galloping them, even in the wor&s;t roads; and as often checking their &s;peed on the mo&s;t level ground. A common piece of rope &s;erves them for a whip, as they urge their hor&s;es on, hooting and whi&s;tling, like cat-calls. The intervals of the&s;e noi&s;es are filled with &s;ing|ing, to which the natives have a great propen&s;ity. No &s;ooner are the po&s;tilions mounted, but they will begin to warble an air, and often continue it, without inter|mi&s;&s;ion, for hours: nay, they will, occa&s;ionally, &s;ing in parts, and in a kind of mu&s;ical dialogue, chanting, as it were, their common conver&s;ation. Thus, the po&s;tilions <HI>&s;ing</HI> from the beginning to the end of a &s;tage; the &s;oldiers <HI>&s;ing,</HI> during their march; the countrymen

The words of the &s;ongs are mo&s;tly in pro&s;e, and often <HI>extem|pore,</HI> according to the immediate invention, or recol|lection of the &s;inger; perhaps an ancient legend, the hi&s;tory of an enormous giant, a declaration of love, a dialogue between a lover and his mi&s;tre&s;s, a murder, or a beautiful girl; &s;ometimes, they are merely letters and &s;yllables, taken from &s;ome old accidence, metri|cally arranged, but &s;eldom in rhyme, and adapted to this general air: the&s;e latter words are chiefly u&s;ed by mothers, in &s;inging to their children; while boors, at the &s;ame time, perform their national dance to the &s;ame tune, accompanied with in&s;trumental mu&s;ic. The &s;ub|ject of the &s;ong &s;hall al&s;o, frequently, allude to the for|mer adventures of the &s;inger, or his pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and, the pea&s;ants will adapt the topics of their common
<PB N="193" REF="203">
di&s;cour&s;e, and their di&s;putes with each other, to this general air, which, altogether, forms an extraordinary effect, and leads one to &s;uppo&s;e that they chaunt their ordinary conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>In their common intercour&s;e, the pea&s;ants are, as I have ob&s;erved, very polite to each other. In higher life, the gentlemen bow very low, and the ladies incline their heads, in&s;tead of curte&s;ying. Sometimes, the gen|tlemen ki&s;s the ladies hands, as a mark of re&s;pect; and, if the parties are well-acquainted, or of equal con|dition, or if the lady is di&s;po&s;ed to pay a compliment, &s;he will &s;alute the gentleman's cheek, whil&s;t he is ki&s;&s;ing her hand; and, frequently, whil&s;t &s;he &s;toops to touch his cheek, he takes that opportunity of &s;aluting her. If the gentleman is a per&s;on of very high rank, the lady offers fir&s;t to ki&s;s his hand, which he prevents, by &s;a|luting her cheek. Men, particularly relations, exchange &s;alutes in this manner, each ki&s;&s;ing the other's hand at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and afterwards their cheeks.</P>
<P>In their u&s;ual mode of addre&s;s, the Ru&s;&s;ians never prefix any title, or appellation of re&s;pect, to their names; but per&s;ons of all ranks, even tho&s;e of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, call each other by their chri&s;tian names; to which they add a patronymick. The&s;e patronymicks are formed, in &s;ome ca&s;es, by adding <HI>Vitch</HI> (&s;imilar to our <HI>Fitz)</HI> to the chri&s;tian name of the father; in others, by <HI>of,</HI> or <HI>Ef.</HI> The former is applied only to

<P>Great families are di&s;tingui&s;hed, in general, by a &s;ur|name; as tho&s;e of Romanof, Galitzin, Sheremetof, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of the nobility are furni&s;hed with great elegance; and, their &s;uites of apartments, where they receive company, are uncommonly &s;plendid.</P>
<P>Their grounds are prettily laid out, in the &s;tile of our parks, with gentle &s;lopes, &s;pacious lawns, &s;cattered plantations, and water, fringed with wood; mo&s;t of the Ru&s;&s;ian nobles having Engli&s;h gardeners, and re&s;ign|ing them&s;elves implicitly to their direction.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h merchants live in a very &s;ocial, and even &s;plendid manner. Be&s;ides con&s;tant meetings at their re&s;pective hou&s;es, they have, once a fortnight, a re|gular a&s;&s;embly, in a hou&s;e hired for the purpo&s;e, to which they obligingly invite all their countrymen, who happen to be at Peter&s;burgh, and, occa&s;ionally, &s;ome Ru&s;&s;ian ladies.

<P><PB N="195" REF="205">The great road from Mo&s;cow to Peter&s;burgh is con|tinued, during a &s;pace of 500 miles, almo&s;t in a &s;traight line, cut through a fore&s;t, and is extremely tedious; on each &s;ide, the trees are cleared away, to the breadth of 40 or 50 paces; and, the whole way lies chiefly through endle&s;s tracts of wood, only broken by villages, round which, to a &s;mall di&s;tance, the grounds are open and cultivated. This road is of a uniform breadth, and formed in the following manner. Trunks of trees are laid hand&s;omely in rows, parallel to each other, and are bound down in the centre, and at each end, by long poles, or beams, fa&s;tened into the ground with wooden pegs; the&s;e trunks are &s;ometimes covered with boards, like a flooring, and &s;ometimes with layers of boughs, &s;trewed over with &s;and, or earth. <HI>Hanway</HI> has made a calculation, and &s;ays, that 100 miles of &s;uch road, takes up 2,100,000 trees. Whil&s;t the road is new, it is remarkably good; but as the trunks de|cay, or &s;ink, or as the &s;and, or ground, is wa&s;hed off, as is the ca&s;e often for miles together, it is full of holes and ridges, and, of cour&s;e, very rough to travel on.

of a much greater extent than that of the Romans, would be as powerful al&s;o; but the common ideas, of its being all a de&s;art, we have already &s;een carried too far. In Siberia there are rich meadows, 100 miles &s;quare. It is very badly peopled, taking the whole to|gether; but many of the provinces are very populous, much of the territory in a good &s;tate of culture, and the appearance of it, in many parts, flouri&s;hing; to this may be added, the great increa&s;e of people, con|&s;tantly gaining by the reception and encouragement given to foreigners to &s;ettle, who flock here in whole troops. This encouragement, which the Empre&s;s al|ways grants, con&s;i&s;ts in &s;everal very important articles. All the expences of the journey, or voyage, from their native country, are borne by her; &s;he feeds, and &s;up|ports them, by the way. On their arrival at the ter|ritory appointed them to cultivate, which has always been part of the crown lands, every family has a cot|tage erected at her expence, to which they contribute la|bour. They are next furni&s;hed with implements ne|ce&s;&s;ary for cultivation, and one year's provi&s;ion for the whole family; and they are exempted from all taxes, for five years. Thus, &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Czarina, to the year 1770, upwards of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and per&s;ons, Germans, Poles, and Greeks from Turkey, have &s;ettled in Ru&s;&s;ia. From the courts of Germany, &s;hip-loads at a time; and, from Poland and Turkey, whole towns, and di&s;tricts; and, as all the promi&s;es that have been made to them (and even more),
<PB N="201" REF="212">
have been inviolably kept, and fre&s;h &s;ettlers are con|tinually pouring in, there is no doubt but, by this time, &s;he has upwards of 1,200,000 new &s;ubjects, which mu&s;t annually encrea&s;e the trade, revenues, and power, of this country.</P>
<P>The product, or manufactures of Ru&s;&s;ia, which con|&s;titutes its commerce with other nations, is pot-a&s;h, wood-a&s;h, Ru&s;&s;ia leather, furs, linen, thread, flax, hemp, &s;eal-&s;kins, train-oil, ro&s;in, pitch, tar, caviare, tallow, honey, wax, i&s;ingla&s;s for glue and &s;hip win|dows, &s;oap, feathers, mu&s;k, rhubarb, and other drugs; al&s;o, ma&s;ts, timber, plank and firs. To the&s;e articles of trade, may be added, the produce of their iron and copper mines; and the raw &s;ilk they bring from China, to which place they carry on a trade by land, in caravans, carrying out furs, and bringing back tea, &s;ilk, cottons, gold, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Ru&s;&s;ia has made great &s;trides in the improvement of her commerce, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, enjoying &s;ome advantages beyond any other nation. The number and greatne&s;s of her rivers opens a communication almo&s;t to every part of the globe; but particularly within her own extended dominions. As to timber, hemp and iron, which are the in&s;trumental cau&s;es of trade, no country in the world produces a greater quantity; which is a natural con&s;equence of the cheapne&s;s of land and labour.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="213">It &s;eems to be a maxim, e&s;tabli&s;hed in all countries where commerce has made any progre&s;s, that the value of exports mu&s;t exceed that of the imports; otherwi&s;e, the balance mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be paid in money. Again&s;t this, the Ru&s;&s;ians, though they have both &s;ilver and gold mines, and of cour&s;e bullion &s;hould be con|&s;idered as a commodity, have taken the precaution to make it next to death, to export their coin; nor can any plate, or bullion, be carried out of the country, but by expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion. In its commerce with England, the balance of trade is greatly again&s;t us.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books of Peter&s;burgh and Cron|&s;tadt, contain the following accounts for 1788:

forming a balance of nearly five millions in their favour.</P>
<P>There is an Engli&s;h factory at Peter&s;burgh, which was, in the reign of <HI>Mary I.</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed at Archangel, but removed to Peter&s;burg, &s;oon after its foundation, and half the trade of that city is in the hands of the Engli&s;h; yet the Ru&s;&s;ian trade, in the Baltic, is car|ried on al&s;o at Riga, Revel, Narva, and Wiburgh. From Riga, a con&s;iderable quantity of corn is export|ed, by the Engli&s;h, Swedes, and Dutch.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="214">Though the Engli&s;h engro&s;s &s;o much of the Ru&s;&s;ian trade, it is but ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve, that there are no monopolies, or exclu&s;ive privileges, a&s;&s;umed by the Ru&s;&s;ia company; nor any rule of conduct e&s;tabli&s;hed, which has the lea&s;t appearance of bringing di&s;credit to this nation; for any natural-born &s;ubject may, for 5<HI>l.</HI> take his freedom of the company, go into Ru&s;&s;ia, and e&s;tabli&s;h a hou&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, under the protection of the Briti&s;h Crown, and may &s;end Ru&s;&s;ian goods into Eng|land, paying the legal duties.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h having opened a trade with the Per|&s;ians, acro&s;s the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, in which they were inter|rupted in 1747, the Ru&s;&s;ians pur&s;ued their track, with per&s;everance. The Ca&s;pian &s;ea, I have had occa&s;ion to mention before: I will only ob&s;erve, now, that it is about 680 miles long, and 260 miles broad, has no tide, but one &s;mall i&s;land in it, uninhabited; that its water is &s;alt, and that, on account of its numberle&s;s &s;hal|lows, it is navigable only by ve&s;&s;els drawing from &s;even to ten feet water. The Ru&s;&s;ian ports, on this &s;ea, are, Gurjef, at the mouth of the Jaik; and Ki&s;lar, on the ea&s;tern coa&s;ts. The havens, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, be|long to Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>The principal commodities exported by the Ru&s;&s;ians to Per&s;ia, are, Engli&s;h, Dutch, French, and Siberian cloths; vitriol, &s;oap, allum, &s;ugar, Ru&s;&s;ia leather, needles, coar&s;e, Ru&s;&s;ia linen, velvets, gla&s;s-ware, paper,
<PB N="204" REF="215">
furs, &s;kins, tea, provi&s;ions, furniture, iron, bra&s;s, tin, lead, hardware, watches, &amp;c. and tho&s;e imported are, raw and manufactured &s;ilks, Bucharian lamb-&s;kins, rice, dried fruits, &s;pices, drugs, &s;affron, &s;alt, &s;ulphur, and naptha; al&s;o, gold and &s;ilver in bars, gold-du&s;t, pre|cious &s;tones, and pearls.</P>
<P>With the Bucharians, who inhabit the &s;outh-we&s;tern part of Independent Tartary, and who are a very com|mercial people (their caravans travelling through the whole continent of A&s;ia, trafficking with Thibet, China, India, and Per&s;ia), the Ru&s;&s;ians trade largely; but the Chine&s;e trade, carried on at Kiachta, as we have &s;een, and &s;ituated on the frontiers of the Chine&s;e and Ru&s;|&s;ian empires, is by far the mo&s;t important of all Ru&s;&s;ia's A&s;iatic commerce; the gro&s;s amount of this trade, in exports and imports, reaching to near 800,000<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling, <HI>per annum.</HI></P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians carry on al&s;o a commerce with the Turks upon the Black Sea, which, in times of peace, is very con&s;iderable. Their great wi&s;h is to e&s;tabli&s;h an intercour&s;e with the parts of the Mediterranean, through the Dardanelles. This trade, as the Ru&s;&s;ians had not till lately any port on the Black Sea, was car|ried on by the Greeks, Armenians, and Turks. The imports were, Greek wines, rai&s;ins, dried figs, almonds, oil, rice, &s;affron, painted linens, and cottons; the ex|ports, hides and leather, coar&s;e linen, hard-ware, ca|viare,
<PB N="205" REF="216">
&amp;c. The&s;e Greek and Armenian merchants, re|turning to Con&s;tantinople, &s;upplied the ports of the &s;ea of Azof, and the Euxine, with Ru&s;&s;ian and European commodities.</P>
<P>The mines of Siberia have been already treated of; to &s;peak more, would be needle&s;s. I will then take notice of the new canal of Vi&s;hnei-Volo&s;hof, cut by <HI>Peter,</HI> and improved by the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s, which opens a communication between the Ca&s;pian &s;ea and the Baltic. Indeed, there is no kingdom on the globe, wherein the inland-navigation is carried through &s;uch an extent of country as in Ru&s;&s;ia; for it is po&s;&s;ible to convey goods, by water, 4,472 miles from the fron|tiers of China to Peter&s;burgh, with an interruption only of about 60 miles; and from A&s;trachan to the &s;ame capital, through a tract of 1,434 miles, without once landing them. A plan was al&s;o &s;et on foot, to open a communication al&s;o with the Black Sea, by means of a canal; and Captain <HI>Perry,</HI> an Engli&s;h engineer, was actually employed for the purpo&s;e. The canal was begun, and the length of a mile and a half cut, but it then dropped, from an idea, that it was not practicable. The pre&s;ent Empre&s;s, however, revived it; and em|ployed Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Lovitz</HI> to undertake it. He took a level of the ground, and traced out the canal, which required to be only five miles long. The great diffi|culty, was how to procure a &s;ufficient &s;upply of water. However, it again fell to the ground, Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Lovitz</HI> being wantonly murdered, by the rebel <HI>Pugatchef.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of their Learning, In&s;titutions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO the Ru&s;&s;ians have made but an in|con&s;iderable appearance in the republic of let|ters; but the late in&s;titutions of academies, and other learned &s;eminaries, have given ri&s;e to a number of &s;ci|entific papers, which have been very favourably re|ceived all over Europe; and are the be&s;t te&s;t of their growing eminence in arts and &s;ciences. Three colleges were founded by <HI>Peter I.</HI> at Mo&s;cow; one for cla&s;&s;ical learning and philo&s;ophy, one for mathematics, and a third for navigation and a&s;tronomy: to the&s;e he added a di&s;pen&s;ary. Lately, a univer&s;ity has been there found|ed; and the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s has founded one at Peter&s;burgh, with 23 profe&s;&s;ors; and two &s;eminaries, where youth are taught Greek, Latin, Ru&s;s, German, Italian, French and Tartar; hi&s;tory, geography, mathe|matics, architecture, fortification, artillery, algebra, drawing, painting, mu&s;ic, fencing, dancing, reading and writing.</P>
<P>The Imperial Academy of Sciences at Peter&s;burgh, owes its in&s;titution to <HI>Peter I. Catharine I.</HI> &s;ettled a fund of 5000<HI>l.</HI> a-year on it, and 15 per&s;ons, men emi|nent for learning and talents, were appointed profe&s;&s;ors, and the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s has largely encouraged it.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="218">An Academy of Arts is al&s;o here e&s;tabli&s;hed, with a revenue of 12,000<HI>l,</HI> a-year, which brings up 300 &s;cho|lars, from the age of &s;ix to eighteen. They are cloathed, fed and lodged, at the expence of the Crown; are in|&s;tructed in reading, writing, arithmetic, drawing, French, and German. At 14, they may chu&s;e any of the fol|lowing arts; painting, architecture, engraving, carv|ing, watch-making, turning, ca&s;ting &s;tatues, gilding, and making artificial gems. Prizes are annually di&s;tri|buted to the be&s;t proficients; and 12 of tho&s;e who have obtained four prizes, are &s;ent abroad, for four years, at the expence of the Crown.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o, at Peter&s;burgh, a free Oeconomical Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture, well endowed; and, in the true &s;pirit of this in&s;titution, &s;everal young men are annually &s;ent to England, to learn hu&s;bandry. Here is al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed a mode of making experiments in agriculture, as &s;ingular in its kind, as it is prai&s;e-worthy and political. At a place called Sophi&s;k, is a farm of about 1000 acres, which is provided with dwelling-hou&s;es, and other nece&s;&s;ary buidings. Here, a clergyman of learning and abilities, who &s;tudied hu&s;bandry many years in England, is &s;et|tled; and, under him, as a&s;&s;i&s;tants, &s;everal young men, who have been educated in England. Every &s;pecies of hu&s;bandry is to be introduced; and lectures on the theory and practice given. From each &s;eminary of the empire, two children of prie&s;ts, who are likely to &s;uc|ceed
<PB N="208" REF="219">
their fathers in their benefices, are to be placed, in this rural e&s;tabli&s;hment, to learn farming, &s;o as to be able to teach their pari&s;hioners. Any nobleman, de&s;irous to improve his tenants, may &s;end a young man al&s;o to this &s;chool to learn.</P>
<P>In Peter&s;burgh, al&s;o, there are two &s;eminaries for the education of the nobility: one for boys, called, <HI>Corps de Cadets;</HI> the other for girls, called, <HI>Le Couvent des Demoi&s;elles nobles.</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t, the number of per&s;ons re&s;iding in the hou&s;e, including the cadets, is 2000: the annual in|come is 30,000<HI>l.</HI> for the reception of 600 &s;cholars. In 1778, there were 480 nobles, and 64 boys of inferior rank, bred up to be tutors to noblemen's children. The nobles are dre&s;&s;ed in uniform, and are intended for the army; they are received at &s;ix, and remain 15, years, and are taught French, German, and all military ac|compli&s;hments. In the &s;ummer, they are encamped, for &s;ix weeks, near the town, are reviewed, and taught all the manoeuvres of war. Some are annually &s;e|lected, according to their merit, to travel into foreign countries. The boys are all brought up in the har|die&s;t manner, not clad in furs, even in winter, nor too much indulged with warmth. They are habituated to all kinds of exerci&s;es, and particularly to running and leaping. At the further end of a large hall, &s;tands a leather hor&s;e, &s;ome parts of which are &s;ix feet high.
<PB N="209" REF="220">
This they leap over in every direction, &s;pring on its head, vault upon its back, turn them&s;elves round upon it, poi&s;e them&s;elves upon their hands, with their head upon the &s;addle, and their feet in the air; and then throw them&s;elves on their feet upon the ground. Once or twice, in the winter, the&s;e cadets are permitted to give a ma&s;querade and ball, to the principal nobility; and, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, &s;ome of the young ladies, from the female &s;eminary, are invited as partners to the bigger boys.</P>
<P>The female &s;eminary is a large building, erected for a nunnery. It was opened, on its pre&s;ent plan, in 1764; and is endowed, by the Empre&s;s, with a revenue of 16,000<HI>l.</HI> a-year. It receives 250 nobles, and 280 trade&s;men's daughters. The girls are admitted at five years of age, and kept till 18. The&s;e two cla&s;&s;es are differently taught, according to their rank. The whole &s;ociety is taught reading, writing, accounts, and nee|dle-work. The young ladies learn hi&s;tory, geography, French, German, Italian, dancing, mu&s;ic, and draw|ing. The other girls are employed in hou&s;hold-affairs. They prepare, and wa&s;h their own linen; are taught to make bread, and the art of cookery. Once a-year, 100 poor women dine in their hall, and are attended by the olde&s;t ladies of the &s;eminary; to each of whom, the&s;e ladies give a piece of &s;ilver coin, and a few yards of linen, to teach them to admini&s;ter to the wants of others. Within their walls, they have a theatre, where the&s;e
<PB N="210" REF="221">
young folks act plays; and, at certain times, are per|mitted to invite their friends, and &s;ome few of the ca|dets, to a ball and &s;upper.</P>
<P>Backward, however, as the Ru&s;&s;ians are in learn|ing, this country can boa&s;t the earlie&s;t hi&s;torian of the north; for, at a period when Poland, Sweden, and Denmark, were unlettered, when even the annali&s;ts of Iceland were mute, a monk of a convent at Kiof, was compiling a hi&s;tory of Ru&s;&s;ia; he died in 1115, and, &s;ince him, there have been some eminent writers in hi&s;tory, and the different &s;ciences. But, in order to &s;pread a ta&s;te for literature among her &s;ubjects, <HI>Catharine</HI> appointed in 1768, a committee, to order and &s;uper|intend tran&s;lations of the cla&s;&s;ics, and the be&s;t modern authors, into the Ru&s;&s;ian tongue; and allowed 1000<HI>l.</HI> a-year, towards defraying the expence of the undertak|ing. In con&s;equence of this, 83 books were tran&s;lated, before 1778; tran&s;lations were then making of 78 more, and 63 were propo&s;ed to be tran&s;lated.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to cla&s;&s;ical literature, the Greek lan|guage is yet taught in very few &s;chools, is &s;carcely known to the laity, and is a rare qualification even among the regular clergy. Latin is more common, being under|&s;tood by many of the regular clergy, and not unfre|quently cultivated by per&s;ons of improved education. Many of the cla&s;&s;ics have been tran&s;lated, by natives, into the Ru&s;&s;ian tongue. Several editions of the mo&s;t
<PB N="211" REF="222">
approved Greek and Roman authors, have been pub|li&s;hed at Mo&s;cow and Peter&s;burgh; but the editors have been chiefly foreigners, encouraged to it by the Ru&s;&s;ian nobility. The archbi&s;hops, however, of Mo&s;cow and Kher&s;on, are men of profound learning, and good, Greek &s;cholars.</P>
<P>The common language of Ru&s;&s;ia is a mixture of the Poli&s;h with the Schlavonian; their prie&s;ts, and learned men, &s;peak, what is called, modern Greek, which tho&s;e who are well acquainted with the ancient Greek, may very well under&s;tand. The forms of the Ru&s;s letters, have al&s;o a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the old Greek alphabet.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of their Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THE e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of Ru&s;&s;ia is that of the Greek church, which is a kind of reform from the Romi&s;h church. They di&s;claim image-wor&s;hip; but yet have a number of pictures of &s;aints in their churches and hou&s;es, to which they pay veneration; but only, as they &s;ay, under the idea of mediators. They deny the Pope's &s;upremacy, yet ob&s;erve a num|ber of fa&s;ts and lents. They oblige their bi&s;hops, but not their prie&s;ts, to celibacy, who have no fixed in|come
<PB N="212" REF="223">
for their &s;upport, but depend on the voluntary contributions of their flocks. Nunneries and mona&s;te|ries were once very frequent; but many are now abo|li&s;hed, and the abu&s;es of tho&s;e that remain very much removed. No man can become a monk, till he is turned of 30; nor any female a nun, till &s;he is 50 years of age; and not even then, but with the expre&s;s per|mi&s;&s;ion of their &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>The head of their church was a patriarch, who&s;e au|thority and juri&s;diction, the Ru&s;&s;ians relate, were derived from the patriarch of the Greek church, who for|merly re&s;ided at Con&s;tantinople, and afterwards at the i&s;le of Scio; to whom they had long paid their &s;pi|ritual &s;ubjection, as the Roman Catholics to the Pope, and u&s;ed to &s;end pre&s;ents annually; and who being, at length, pre&s;&s;ed and driven from thence by the Turks, <HI>Hieronymo,</HI> the then Great Patriarch, being invited and encouraged by the Czar, did, in 1558, come to Mo&s;|cow, and there re&s;ign his patriarchal &s;ee to the metro|politan of Mo&s;cow, as &s;upreme bi&s;hop, and pa&s;tor, of the Greek church. This Patriarch of Mo&s;cow, was afterwards in very high e&s;teem with the people; and bore, with the Czar, a kind of &s;overeignty in the em|pire: for he was not only &s;upreme judge, in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, but had a power to reform, by his own au|thority, whatever he thought prejudicial to good mo|rals; and could pa&s;s &s;entence of death, without ac|quainting the court with it; former Czars having or|dered
<PB N="213" REF="224">
&s;uch &s;entences to be put into execution, without the lea&s;t demur, or he&s;itation.</P>
<P>But on the death of the eleventh Patriarch, in 1699, who was a very old man, and who happened to die &s;oon after <HI>Peter I.</HI> returned from his travels, he refu&s;ed to have any other Patriarch elected, and took upon him|&s;elf to be the &s;ole head and governor of his church, giving only to the Metropolitan of Razan, the admi|ni&s;tration of eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs; who was, in matters of moment, to apply to the Czar for directions. This tran&s;action chagrined the clergy; and, it coming to <HI>Peter</HI>'s ears, that a bi&s;hop had talked a little too freely again&s;t this new authority of his, his maje&s;ty ordered him to be formally degraded; but the other bi&s;hops remon&s;trating again&s;t this order, and &s;aying, among other things, that they, being all bi&s;hops and but of equal rank, could not do it, unle&s;s a new Patriarch, or &s;upreme, was fir&s;t elected; the Czar created a new bi|&s;hop on purpo&s;e, and ordered him to do it; and, ac|cordingly, the mitre was taken from the head of this contumacious bi&s;hop, by the one new created.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters of their churches, whom they call <HI>Popes,</HI> and <HI>Proto popes</HI> (or prie&s;ts, and arch-prie&s;ts), never preach to the people, &s;ays <HI>Perry,</HI> who wrote the beginning of this century; &s;ome few only excepted, who preach before the Czar, in the cathedral church, on great holidays. The height of the learning which the
<PB N="214" REF="225">
common clergy can be &s;aid to be ma&s;ters of, or, in|deed, that is required of them as a qualification for holy orders, is, that they can chant, or read over di&s;|tinctly, the &s;ervice of the church, have a good, clear voice, a fair character, and can repeat <HI>Ho&s;pidi Pomilio,</HI> that is, "Lord, have mercy upon us," 12 or 15 times in a breath. Nor did they much regard from whence they took their prie&s;ts; but, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their univer&s;ities, there is a reform in this, as in other things.</P>
<P>Of all their &s;aints, the Ru&s;&s;ians hold St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> mo&s;t in e&s;teem; and often &s;peak of him as a god. If you a&s;k them, on cro&s;&s;ing a lake, how far it is to &s;uch a place, they will tell you, that if it plea&s;es St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> to &s;end them a fair wind, they &s;hall get there by &s;uch a time.</P>
<P>There is no great difference between the Ru&s;s reli|gion, and that of the Papi&s;ts, with re&s;pect, as I have ob&s;erved, to their holding &s;aints in adoration, and keep|ing of holidays; in their belief, that it is in the power of the prie&s;t to forgive &s;ins; and in the point of damn|ing, or inveighing again&s;t all people, of any other re|ligion than their own. They oblige the clergy to marry one wife, agreeable to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s direction, but no more; and if &s;he dies, he can officiate no longer than one year afterwards, but u&s;ually retires to a mona&s;tery for bread. On this account it is, that prie&s;ts in Ru&s;&s;ia u&s;e
<PB N="215" REF="226">
their wives better than any men in the country. They admini&s;ter the &s;acrament, in both kinds, to the laity, as well as the clergy; and though they pray for the dead, they believe, if a man receives the prie&s;t's ble&s;|&s;ing before he dies, and has a certificate for St. <HI>Ni|cholas,</HI> that he departed in the true chri&s;tian faith (which certificate is put between his fingers, when laid in his grave), that he &s;hall be admitted into heaven. They differ al&s;o from the Papi&s;ts, and the reformed churches, concerning the Holy Trinity: they &s;ay, the Holy Gho&s;t proceeds from the Father only, not from Father and Son; and &s;o much reverence his de&s;cent in the form of a dove, that very few of them will eat a pigeon. One of the &s;tronge&s;t and hotte&s;t di&s;putes they have among them, about any difference in point of re|ligion, is the manner of holding their fingers when they cro&s;s them&s;elves; one of their Patriarchs having enjoined, that laymen &s;hould only cro&s;s them&s;elves with two fingers; whereas, there is an ob&s;tinate &s;ect among them, that will do it with three.</P>
<P>From a general opinion, that no man can be &s;aved, but tho&s;e who profe&s;s the Greek religion, it is reckoned a great merit, in men of opulence and rank, to bring over pro&s;elytes to the Ru&s;&s;ian faith; nor is a man ac|counted a chri&s;tian, till he has been re-baptized. In this ceremony, he is to &s;pit three times over his left &s;houlder, &s;ays <HI>Perry,</HI> and repeat the&s;e words, after the prie&s;t: <Q>Cur&s;ed are my parents, that brought me up
<PB N="216" REF="227">
in the religion that I have been taught; I &s;pit upon them, and upon their religion.</Q> Thus do they di&s;|pute for trifles, whil&s;t they neglect the &s;olid things of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Like the Roman Catholics, they have al&s;o their mi|racles, and tho&s;e equally as ridiculous. For the amu&s;e|ment of my readers, I will relate one or two of them. There are 72 mona&s;teries, belonging to the di&s;trict of the city of Novogorod; the chief of which is dedicated to the famous St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> of whom the Ru&s;&s;ians relate this &s;tory.&mdash;That he (being guided by the vi&s;ion of an angel), came, about 700 years ago, from the mouth of the river Tyber, on the coa&s;t of Italy, round through the Great Ocean up the Baltick, and by way of the Lodoga &s;ea, and river Volcoff, to the city of Novo|gorod, in four days, upon a mill-&s;tone; and, by this miracle, occa&s;ioned the thorough conver&s;ion of the country to the chri&s;tian faith.&mdash;In the month of June, they have a proce&s;&s;ion about the city, in commemo|ration of the day of St. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s arrival; a mona&s;tery is built on the &s;pot where he landed, and the mill-&s;tone on which he floated, is &s;till to be &s;een, placed upon one edge, in the church belonging to this mona&s;tery, near which the body of St. <HI>Anthony</HI> is buried, in a &s;tone-coffin: and the Ru&s;&s;ians affirm, as an undeniable te&s;ti|mony of the truth of this miracle, that God has pre|&s;erved his body from corruption; and they generally expo&s;e it to the view of &s;uch per&s;ons as humbly come to pay their devotions at his tomb.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="228">In the di&s;trict of Novogorod al&s;o, by the river Tiffin, which falls into the Lodoga &s;ea, there is a mona&s;tery, dedicated to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin; of which they relate the following miracle: <HI>viz.</HI> That the church, which is now &s;tanding within the walls of the mona&s;tery, was originally built on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river; and that the place where it now &s;tands, which is a hard, gravelly bank, for &s;everal miles above and below it, was then a mere bog; but that the Mother of God came through the air, in 24 hours, from Con&s;tanti|nople, and, in the night, removed the &s;aid church, over the river, into the &s;aid bog, which immediately became hard ground; and that &s;he did this, in order to be wor&s;hipped by the people on that &s;ide of the river to which &s;he removed the church.</P>
<P>Carved images are forbidden in their churches, agreeable to the law of Mo&s;es, which forbids the wor|&s;hip of any graven image; but pictures of their &s;aints, they &s;ay, are no images, and are approved by God; and tell the following &s;tory, as a confirmation.&mdash;That a painter, trying to paint a likene&s;s of our Saviour, and finding, that what he painted at one time, did not agree with the likene&s;s he had given at another, was exceed|ingly unea&s;y; that our Saviour, accordingly, took com|pa&s;&s;ion on him, appeared, and called the painter to him, a&s;ked him for his pocket-handkerchief, laid it on his face, and returned it to the painter, &s;aying, he would, when &s;pread, find his picture upon it.&mdash;That,
<PB N="218" REF="229">
from this original, the Ru&s;s painters copy the like|ne&s;s of our Saviour, with great exactne&s;s; and, of cour&s;e, it benefits the limner's trade, in this country.</P>
<P>One more, and I have done.&mdash;They repre&s;ent the Virgin Mary with three hands, and on the following account. In the kingdom of Ca&s;an, a painter had been drawing the Virgin, with our Saviour in her arms, and had &s;o di&s;po&s;ed the picture, as to &s;hew both her hands; but having left it, and returning to fini&s;h it, in&s;tead of two hands, he found three. Conceiving it to be a trick, he rubbed out the additional one, and having fini&s;hed it, locked it up, and put the key in his pocket; but returning, the &s;econd morning, he found a third hand painted again, as before; on which he cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed: but, after a little reflection, &s;till looked on it as a trick put upon him, rubbed it out a &s;econd time, and &s;ecured the room tho|roughly. Coming again the third morning, he found the third hand painted again; and going to efface it, the Virgin her&s;elf appeared, bade him forbear, and told him, it was her will to be drawn with three hands; which the Ru&s;&s;ians, to this day follow, and call her the <HI>Cazan&s;ky Boagaroditza,</HI> or Cazan&s;ky mother of God.</P>
<P>The churches I have already &s;poken of, except that they have no &s;eats, the Greek ceremonial requiring all per&s;ons to &s;tand. But I mu&s;t not forget their bells, which form no incon&s;iderable part of their divine wor|&s;hip;
<PB N="219" REF="230">
as the length, or &s;hortne&s;s of their peals, a&s;cer|tains the greater or le&s;&s;er &s;anctity of the day. They are hung in belfries, detached from the church; do not &s;wing, like our bells, but are fixed immoveably to the beams, and are rung by a rope tied to the clapper, and pulled &s;ideways. Some of the&s;e bells are of &s;tupendous &s;ize. One, in the tower of St. Ivan's church, at Mo&s;|cow, weighs 3,551 Ru&s;&s;ian puds, or 127,836 Engli&s;h pounds. It has always been e&s;teemed a meritorious act of religion, to pre&s;ent a church with bells; and the piety of the donor has been mea&s;ured, by their mag|nitude. According to this mode of e&s;timation, <HI>Boris Gudonof,</HI> who gave a bell to the cathedral of Mo&s;cow, that weighed 288,000lb. was the mo&s;t pious &s;overeign of Ru&s;&s;ia, till he was &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by the Empre&s;s <HI>Anne,</HI> at who&s;e expence a bell was ca&s;t, that weighs 443,772lb. and which exceeds, in &s;ize, every bell in the known world. Its value, at 3<HI>s.</HI> a lb. is 65,681&pound;. a va&s;t &s;um&mdash; but every one, ambitious to contribute towards it, threw &s;ome gold or &s;ilver into the furnaces, which were four in number; and the&s;e furnaces having cocks, let off the metal into the mould. Its height is 19 feet, its circumference at the bottom 21 yards 11 inches, its greate&s;t thickne&s;s 23 inches. This bell was hung to a beam in a pit; but the beam having been burnt in a great fire which happened at Mo&s;cow, gave way, and the bell fell, and a piece broke out of it, large enough to admit two per&s;ons a-brea&s;t, without &s;tooping. Its diameter, at bottom, is 22 feet, 4&frac34; inches; at top, 7 feet, 4&frac34; inches.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="231">To give my readers &s;ome idea of the ceremonial of the Greek church, I will lay before them a de&s;cription, from <HI>Coxe,</HI> who was pre&s;ent, at Mo&s;cow, when the Archbi&s;hop performed the &s;ervice, one Sunday morn|ing. On his entrance, the chori&s;ters &s;ung a hymn, taken from P&s;alm cxiii. ver&s;e 3, which they fini&s;hed as he approached the &s;hrine, or &s;anctuary. Having then &s;aid a &s;hort prayer, he placed him&s;elf on a rai&s;ed &s;eat in the middle of the church <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bi&s;hops, alone, have the privilege of robing in the middle of the church; the common prie&s;ts, put on their ve&s;tments, in the &s;hrine, or &s;anctuary.</NOTE>, and taking off his man|dyas, or common garment, the attendant prie&s;ts ki&s;&s;ed his hand, whil&s;t they delivered to him the different parts of his co&s;tly, pontifical ve&s;tments, which, in receiving, he rai&s;ed to his lips, to ki&s;s the cro&s;s embroidered on them, before he put them on. He al&s;o placed, on his head, a crown, richly ornamented with pearls and pre|cious &s;tones. His dre&s;s was &s;imilar to the Imperial robe, formerly worn by the Greek emperors of Con|&s;tantinople, and which they permitted the &s;upreme dig|natories of the church to wear, during divine &s;ervice; and the &s;ame attire &s;till continues, to di&s;tingui&s;h the hierarchy of the Greek church e&s;tabli&s;hed in Ru&s;&s;ia, from the lower orders. The archbi&s;hop being robed, repaired to the &s;anctuary, and &s;oon after began the &s;er|vice, part of which was performed in the Sclavonian tongue, by the different prie&s;ts, and part by the arch|bi&s;hop
<PB N="221" REF="232">
in the Greek language, which he pronounced according to the accent of the modern Greeks. In conformity to the rules of the church, no organ, or other mu&s;ical in&s;trument, was introduced; but the vocal harmony, which con&s;i&s;ted in hymns, was exceed|ingly plea&s;ing. Lighted tapers, and incen&s;e, &s;eemed no le&s;s e&s;&s;ential parts of their wor&s;hip, than among the Roman Catholics. Towards the conclu&s;ion of the pray|ers, the archbi&s;hop, and clergy, retired within the &s;anctuary, to receive the communion; the folding-doors that enclo&s;e that place, were immediately &s;hut, and none of the laity, at that time, partook of this rite; but a &s;tranger is permitted to view the whole, through a &s;ide-door. The communicants &s;tood through the ce|remony, and the wine was, according to u&s;ual cu&s;tom, mixed with warm water; the bread, cut into &s;mall pieces, was put into the wine; and the elements, of both kinds, were given, at the &s;ame time, in a &s;poon.</P>
<P>The whole &s;ervice la&s;ted about an hour; and the archbi&s;hop, having pronounced the final benediction, again &s;eated him&s;elf in the middle of the church, and unrobed.</P>
<P>On the 6th of January, old &s;tile, they have an an|nual ceremony, of a religious nature, that of ble&s;&s;ing the waters. This u&s;ed to be held upon the Neva; on which occa&s;ion, the &s;overeign attended in per&s;on upon

the ice, and all the regiments of guards were drawn out, in great &s;olemnity. Its pomp, though &s;till &s;plen|did, is now much dimini&s;hed.&mdash;The principal circum|&s;tances are as follow:</P>
<P>On the frozen &s;urface of a &s;mall canal, between the Admiralty and the Palace, is erected an octagon pavi|lion of wood, painted green, and ornamented with boughs of fir, open at the &s;ide, and crowned by a dome, &s;upported by eight pillars. On the top is the figure of St. John, with the cro&s;s; and four paintings, repre|&s;enting &s;ome of our Saviour's miracles: on the out&s;ide, a carved image of the Holy-Spirit, under the emblem of a dove, was &s;u&s;pended, as is u&s;ual in the &s;anctuaries of the Greek churches. The floor of this edifice is carpeted, excepting a &s;quare vacancy in the middle, in which an opening in the ice is cut, and a ladder let down into the water. The pavilion is enclo&s;ed by pal|li&s;ades, adorned with fir-twigs; and the intermediate &s;pace al&s;o carpeted. From one of the windows of the Palace, a &s;caffold is erected, to the extremity of the canal, and lined with red cloth. At a time appointed, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> who was pre&s;ent on one of the&s;e occa&s;ions, the Empre&s;s appeared at this window, and the arch|bi&s;hop, who was to perform the benediction, pa&s;&s;ed, at the head of a numerous proce&s;&s;ion, along the &s;caffold|ing, into the octagon, round which were drawn up a few &s;oldiers of each regiment quartered at Peter&s;burg: after having pronounced a few prayers, he de&s;cended
<PB N="223" REF="234">
the ladder, plunged a cro&s;s into the water, and then &s;prinkled the colours of each regiment. At the con|clu&s;ion of this ceremony, the archbi&s;hop retired, and the people ru&s;hed, in crowds, into the octagon, drank the water with eagerne&s;s, &s;prinkled it upon their clothes, and carried home &s;ome of it, to purify their hou&s;es.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of their Con&s;titution, Government, Laws, Revenue, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE government of Ru&s;&s;ia is the mo&s;t ab&s;olute in Europe: there is not even the appearance of the lea&s;t barrier between the people, and the will of the &s;overeign. All ranks are equally &s;laves to the Crown, not &s;ubjects; and their puni&s;hments &s;hew the &s;pirit of the legi&s;lature. The greate&s;t nobility are liable to be &s;eized for the mo&s;t trifling offence, and bani&s;hed to Siberia, their e&s;tates confi&s;cated, and their families ru|ined; or they are liable to &s;uffer the knout, that is, to be whipped to death; or undergo other violent puni&s;h|ments, &s;uch as having their tongues cut out, to be hung up by the ribs, and many other inflictions of bar|barity, which &s;hew the cruelty of de&s;poti&s;m, without having its good effect. The &s;ecret court of chancery, which is a tribunal compo&s;ed of a few mini&s;ters cho&s;en by the &s;overeign, leaves the lives and fortunes of all fa|milies
<PB N="224" REF="235">
at his mercy; and the nobles of Ru&s;&s;ia, thus brought under the yoke of the mo&s;t dreadful &s;lavery, do not fail to retaliate on the people, who are &s;laves to the nobles, as well as to the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>The inhabitants, in general, may be divided into four orders.&mdash;1. That of the nobles, and gentry; 2. That of the clergy; 3. That of the merchants, and trade&s;men; and, 4. That of the pea&s;ants.&mdash;The fir&s;t three, include almo&s;t all the free &s;ubjects of the em|pire; the latter, all the va&s;&s;als, or &s;laves.</P>
<P>The nobles, and gentry, are the &s;ole per&s;ons who, in the &s;pirit of feudal de&s;poti&s;m, have a right to po&s;&s;e&s;s land; but, in&s;tead of appearing them&s;elves, according to the tenure of that &s;y&s;tem, at the head of their retainers, are now only expected to &s;erve in the army, and are obliged to furni&s;h recruits, in proportion to their e&s;tates.</P>
<P>In Ru&s;&s;ia, as in oriental governments, there is little di&s;tinction of rank among the nobility, excepting what is derived from the &s;ervice of the &s;overeign. No family of rank derives any &s;olid benefit from hereditary de&s;cent. The importance of a noble hou&s;e, of immen&s;e property and official honours, is almo&s;t annihilated, on the death of the chief; becau&s;e, the property he leaves behind him, is equally divided among his &s;ons; and becau&s;e, titles, though hereditary, do not, independent of the
<PB N="225" REF="236">
favour of the Crown, add any weight to the wearer: tho&s;e of prince, count, or baron, conveying, in them|&s;elves, little di&s;tinction, unle&s;s accompanied with &s;ome high, civil, or military employ. According to the &s;y&s;tem introduced by <HI>Peter I.</HI> but which has been abu&s;ed &s;ince his time, every per&s;on takes precedence from his military &s;tation; and he mu&s;t ri&s;e, in re|gular gradation, from a corporal to a field-officer: yet this is rather eluded, gentlemens' &s;ons being made cor|porals in their infancy. And although the law of <HI>Peter I.</HI> which compelled every gentleman to &s;erve in the army, on pain of degradation, is now overlooked, yet no one, under the rank of a major, let his fortune be ever &s;o large, is permitted to drive more than two hor&s;es; under that of brigadier, more than four. A nobleman of the highe&s;t fortune and di&s;tinction, who has never been in the army, is not allowed, but by e&s;|pecial favour of the Crown, to u&s;e a carriage in the capital, drawn by more than one hor&s;e; though a mer|chant may have two. There are various methods, how|ever, of conferring military rank, and the privileges attendant on it. The high-chamberlain, <HI>ranks</HI> as major-general; &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, as officers; and, contributors to the foundling-ho&s;pital at Mo&s;cow, as lieutenants.</P>
<P>The&s;e regulations, and the ea&s;y acqui&s;ition of mili|tary rank, has induced Mr. <HI>Schloetzer,</HI> a German &s;ettled in Ru&s;&s;ia, to expre&s;s him&s;elf, with &s;ome humour, in
<PB N="226" REF="237">
the following manner:&mdash;<Q>A nobleman is here no|thing; his &s;ituation in the army, alone, marks the value of his exi&s;tence. A phy&s;ician has the <HI>rank</HI> of major, and dares, as a &s;taff-officer, put four hor&s;es to his carriage, whil&s;t others can only drive two. An apothecary, in the Imperial &s;ervice, has the <HI>rank</HI> of a captain; his apprentices, that of en&s;igns; and the two &s;urgeons of the di&s;trict, have the rank of lieute|nants.</Q>&mdash;But, however ridiculous the&s;e promotions may appear, they are founded on principles of the &s;ound|e&s;t policy; for, as by a decree of <HI>Peter the Great,</HI> every officer is noble during life, and the children of a &s;taff-officer, are cla&s;&s;ed among the nobility; any in&s;titution tending to increa&s;e the number of this order of men, who alone are entitled to po&s;&s;e&s;s land, mu&s;t be beneficial to &s;ociety. On their own e&s;tates, the nobles, and gen|try are almo&s;t uncontroled.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of the church, the &s;overeign is the head; the eccle&s;ia&s;tic authority being con&s;igned to a tribunal, called, the Sacred Synod; which is compo&s;ed of the &s;overeign as pre&s;ident, the metropolitan archbi&s;hop, the vice-pre&s;ident, and a number of coun&s;ellors and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The clergy are divided into regular and &s;ecular; the fir&s;t are monks, the &s;econd, pari&s;h-prie&s;ts. The prin|cipal wealth of the church, was centered in the mo|na&s;teries, which had e&s;tates to the amount of 400,000&pound;.
<PB N="227" REF="238">
a-year; and, like all other landholders, enjoyed un|controuled authority over their pea&s;ants, who held un|der them. But the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s has annexed the&s;e church-lands to the Crown, and given annual pen&s;ions to the hierarchy, the dignified clergy, and the monks. The archbi&s;hops, and bi&s;hops, receive about 1000&pound;. a year; and the &s;ubordinate eecle&s;ia&s;tics, in pro|portion.</P>
<P>All the dignitaries of the church are cho&s;en from the order of monks. The&s;e are archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops, archi-mandrites, or abbots, and igoomens, or priors. There are 33 archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops; and, through|out Ru&s;&s;ia, 159 mona&s;teries, governed by 58 archi|mandrites; and 99 ignoomens, and 67 nunneries. There are 2,677 monks, and 1,299 nuns. Other prie&s;ts, and eccle&s;ia&s;tics, belonging to the nunneries and cathedrals, are, in number, 1,537.</P>
<P>The papas, popes, or pari&s;h-prie&s;ts, in Ru&s;&s;ia, are generally the very refu&s;e of the people; many of them cannot even read. The&s;e deliver the &s;ervice from me|mory; a chapter of the New Te&s;tament, or part of a homily, which they repeat every Friday and Sunday. Be&s;ides the &s;urplice-fees, which, in the poore&s;t be|nefice, amounts to 4&pound;. a-year; and, in the mo&s;t pro|fitable, to but 24&pound;. They have only a wooden hou&s;e, &s;carcely &s;uperior to that of the meane&s;t of their pari&s;h|ioners; and a &s;mall portion of lands, which they cul|tivate
<PB N="228" REF="239">
u&s;ually with their own hands; whil&s;t the highe&s;t dignity to which they can ever attain, while they con|tinue married, is that of proto-pope of a cathedral, who&s;e income &s;carcely exceeds 20&pound;. a-year.&mdash;No wonder, then, they are &s;o illiterate, when they have &s;o little encou|ragement to be otherwi&s;e! The Empre&s;s has, to make amends for this, had a number of &s;ermons, inculcating the moral duties, printed in the Ru&s;&s;ian language; and the&s;e are di&s;tributed among the parochial cler|gy, and occa&s;ionally read by them, in time of divine &s;ervice. The children of the &s;ecular clergy are all free, and are u&s;ually brought up for orders, or employed in the &s;ervice of the church.</P>
<P>All the clergy wear long beards, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the laity, by &s;uffering their hair to &s;tream, for a con&s;iderable length, over their &s;houlders, without being tied, or curled. Their dre&s;s is a &s;quare bonnet, and a long robe, of a black, or dark colour, reaching to their ancles. The clergy do not mix with the polite world, being men of low breeding, and extremely ignorant; and, the dignitaries of the church, &s;eclude them&s;elves, from choice.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third cla&s;s, are tho&s;e between the nobles and the pea&s;ants, the mercantile part of the people. The&s;e are exempted from the poll-tax, and from being draughted for either army or navy (on condition of their paying one <HI>per cent.</HI> of their capital employed in trade, to the
<PB N="229" REF="240">
Crown), two &s;ituations con&s;idered, in this country, as indubitable marks of &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>It is a circum&s;tance worthy of remark, that the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants, and trade&s;men, &s;eldom keep any book of account, as few of them can either read or write, and are unacquainted with the knowledge of figures. Their manner of reckoning, is by a kind of machine, with &s;everal rows of wires, on which beads are &s;trung. The beads on the fir&s;t row, &s;tand for units; tho&s;e on the &s;econd, for tens; and &s;o on: and, by this machine, they can add, &s;ubtract, multiply, and divide, with facility and exactne&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth order of &s;ubjects, are the pea&s;ants; which, except tho&s;e of Finland and Carelia, the Uk|raine, and a few others, are all va&s;&s;als, or &s;laves. The&s;e may be divided into pea&s;ants of the Crown, and pea|&s;ants of individuals.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the Crown inhabit the Imperial deme&s;nes, and are about a &s;ixth part of the whole. They are un|der the juri&s;diction of the Imperial bailiffs; and, though liable to great exactions from the&s;e petty tyrants, yet, being under the protection of the Crown, are much more &s;ecure of their property, than the pea&s;ants of in|dividuals. Many of the&s;e have been made free, and have enrolled them&s;elves among the merchants and traders. But,</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="241">The pea&s;ants belonging to individuals, are, the pri|vate property of the land-holders, as much as are their implements of hu&s;bandry, or herds of cattle; and the value of an e&s;tate is e&s;timated, as in Poland, by its number of boors, and not by its number of acres. With re&s;pect to the lord's own demands upon his pea&s;ants, he is re&s;trained by no law, either in the exaction of any &s;um, or in the mode of employing them. He is ab&s;o|lute ma&s;ter of their time and labour: &s;ome he employs in agriculture; a few he makes his menial &s;ervants, and perhaps without wages; and, from others, he exacts an annual payment. Each va&s;&s;al is rated according to the arbitrary will of his ma&s;ter. Some pay four or five &s;hillings a-year; others, engaged in trade, contribute in proportion to their profits. A ma&s;on &s;hall pay 6&pound;. a-year; a &s;mith, 12&pound;.; and &s;ome, as high as 20&pound;. The capital they may acquire by trade, is liable to be &s;eized, and there can be no redre&s;s; for, according to an old, feudal law, a &s;lave cannot in&s;titute a proce&s;s again&s;t his ma&s;ter. Some of the Ru&s;&s;ian nobility will &s;end their va&s;&s;als to Mo&s;cow, or Peter&s;burgh, to learn trades, and then employ them, on return, on their own e&s;tates, let them out for hire, &s;ell them at an advanced price, or receive from them an annual compen&s;ation, for a permi&s;&s;ion to carry on their trades for their own advantage.</P>

not to death; but, by the new code of laws now enacted, this enormous power of the lords is re|&s;trained. A pea&s;ant may, however, obtain his liberty three ways. 1. By manumi&s;&s;ion; which, on the death of his ma&s;ter, is frequently granted to his dome&s;tics; 2, by purcha&s;e; and, 3, by &s;erving in the army, or navy: a pea&s;ant being free, from the moment of his en|rollment, and continuing &s;o when di&s;charged. A law is now pa&s;t, to oblige every nobleman, who&s;e e&s;tate con|&s;i&s;ts of a certain number of families, to enfranchi&s;e one of the mo&s;t indu&s;trious families yearly; when &s;o &s;et free, he has a farm a&s;&s;igned him, and the Empre&s;s makes him a pre&s;ent of &s;ome implements; and, after three years, he is obliged to pay his old ma&s;ter a good rent for that farm. This is done to induce the land-holders to take rent for their land, in&s;tead of &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The va&s;t empire of Ru&s;&s;ia was di&s;tributed into nine exten&s;ive governments. Each government was &s;ub|divided into provinces; and each province, into di&s;tricts, or circles. Over each government, was appointed a governor; over the provinces, a waywode, and his officers, who formed a chancery; and over the di&s;tricts, an inferior waywode, or a kind of ju&s;tice of peace. This mode of governing was found defective, and the Empre&s;s has e&s;tabli&s;hed a new one; the heads of which are as follow:</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="243">The nine exten&s;ive governments, are di&s;tributed into a larger number, each containing from 3 to 400,000 people.

<P>In &s;hort, Ru&s;&s;ia, with re&s;pect to the va&s;t ma&s;s of its people, is now nearly in the &s;ame &s;tate in which the greate&s;t part of Europe was plunged in the 11th and 12th centuries; when the feudal &s;y&s;tem was gradually de|clining; when the unbounded authority of the land|holders over their &s;laves, was beginning to be counter-balanced by the introduction of an intermediate order of merchants; when new towns were continually erect|ing, and endowed with increa&s;ing immunities; and when the Crown began to give freedom to many of its va&s;|fals. The completion of the&s;e plans have, in a few centuries, brought Europe to its pre&s;ent &s;tate; and, as the legi&s;lature of Ru&s;&s;ia, has now the hi&s;tory of other nations to refer to, it is not to be doubted, but this country, under a wi&s;e in&s;titution, will reach the per|fection of European &s;tates, in a much &s;horter period.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="244">The revenues of Ru&s;&s;ia, be&s;ides the impo&s;ts paid by the Ukraine, and the provinces conquered from Swe|den, chiefly ari&s;e from the poll-tax, the duties of im|port and export, an exci&s;e upon &s;alt, the crown and church-lands, the mint, the &s;ale of &s;pirituous liquors, &amp;c. which, in the whole, amount to about 6,144,968&pound;. &s;ter|ling, which, at the acce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Peter the Great,</HI> did not exceed one million. Much of the revenue ari&s;es from monopolies; the whole trade to China, belongs to the Crown; &s;o does that of rhubarb, pot-a&s;hes, and &s;pices, hemp, iron, beer, and brandy. Of this revenue, the expences of army and navy amount to about 3,072,485&pound;. tho&s;e of the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, to 2,272,483&pound;. and the remainder, or 800,000&pound;. is appropriated to the privy-pur&s;e of the Empre&s;s. But though this 800,000&pound;. is equal to 2,400,000&pound;. Engli&s;h, it is difficult to conceive, how &s;he is able to maintain the magnificence of her court, the number of public in&s;titutions, the numerous buildings (which, in time of peace, ri&s;e to 200,000&pound;. yearly), which are rai&s;ed at her expence, the liberality with which &s;he encourages the arts and &s;ciences, the many purcha&s;es &s;he is continually making, all over Europe, and the immen&s;e di&s;tinctions which &s;he confers on the mo&s;t favoured of her &s;ubjects;&mdash;and yet the &s;tate is free from debt.</P>
<P>The &s;tanding army of Ru&s;&s;ia, is computed at near 250,000 regular men; be&s;ides which, the Empre&s;s can always a&s;&s;emble a body of 40 or 50,000 Kalmucks,
<PB N="234" REF="245">
Co&s;&s;acks, and other irregular troops; and as excellent a train of artlllery as any in the world. The regulars con&s;i&s;t chiefly of infantry, except about 60,000 hor&s;e; and include all tho&s;e who wear uniforms, and are train|ed to European di&s;cipline. When properly di&s;ciplined, they are very excellent &s;oldiers; being brave, &s;teady, obedient, patient of fatigue and hard&s;hip, and &s;carcely ever guilty of de&s;ertion.</P>
<P>They are &s;o naturally fearle&s;s, &s;ays Captain <HI>Perry,</HI> as not to be di&s;couraged at death. I have &s;een, &s;ays he, &s;everal of them walk to execution, with chains on their legs, and wax tapers burning in their hands, and as they pa&s;&s;ed the crowds, bow to them, and &s;ay, <HI>Pro&s;tee Brats,</HI> that is, "Adieu, brothers!" and the people make the like reply to them, bidding them adieu! and have laid down their heads on the blocks, and re&s;igned their lives with a &s;teady countenance. This natural fearle&s;sne&s;s, their being con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to the ex|tremes of heat and cold, and their cu&s;tom of bathing once or twice a-week, through their lives, as I have de&s;cribed, makes them fit to encounter any thing; &s;o that it is &s;aid, let the Ru&s;&s;ians have but good officers, and they will not fail to make good &s;oldiers. The uni|form is green, turned up with red, white wai&s;tcoats and breeches. The troops, in general, are rai&s;ed at little or no expence; and, whil&s;t in their own country, &s;ub|&s;i&s;t&punc; chiefly on provi&s;ions furni&s;hed them by the country-people, according to their internal valuation.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="246">If we judge from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Ru&s;&s;ian army, we may look for great &s;ucce&s;s in any war. The men may be all called veterans. It has not any neigh|bours, to whom it is not much &s;uperior in force. Poland is at its mercy. Pru&s;&s;ia is not equal to her, and will never be able to make another &s;tand again&s;t her; the Ru&s;&s;ian army being now more powerful, more numerous, and with an artillery inferior to none&mdash;an advantage &s;he never had before. Poland behind her, three-fourths of it ab&s;olutely in her power to winter in, in a Turki&s;h war, in&s;tead of falling back to Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Ru&s;&s;ian navy, promi&s;es al&s;o well to the empire: full of hands, and full of &s;hips, new ones every day launching at Peter&s;burgh, and all the old ones repairing. She has many &s;hip-carpenters at Tanais, on the Black Sea, and will be there extremely formidable. Ru&s;&s;ia produces every article nece&s;&s;ary for the con&s;truction and equipment of &s;hips, which are chiefly built at Cron&s;tadt, Peter&s;burgh, and Archangel. Manufactures of cordage, and &s;ail-cloth, are e&s;tabli&s;hed in different parts of the empire; and the magazines of Peter&s;burgh and Archangel, are always plentifully &s;tored with large quantities of both the&s;e articles. In 1778, the navy of this country con&s;i&s;ted of 38 &s;hips of the line, 15 frigates, 4 prames, and 109 gallies. At Cron|&s;tadt, there is an Imperial ho&s;pital for &s;ailors, and an academy for marines, and officers of the navy. This, in 1778, contained 370 cadets, who are cloathed, main|tained,
<PB N="236" REF="247">
and taught at the expence of the Crown. They are admitted at the age of five, and are &s;uffered to re|main there till 17. They learn accounts, mathematics, drawing, fortification, and navigation; and have ma&s;|ters in the French, German, Engli&s;h, and Swedi&s;h languages. They are trained to naval affairs, and make an annual crui&s;e on the Baltic, as far as Revel.</P>
<P>Indeed, what gives great weight to the naval &s;trength of Ru&s;&s;ia, is the number of her gallies, which carry from 100 to 300 men, &s;ix or eight only of which are &s;ailors. Rowing is, to the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers, what &s;wim|ming was to the Romans. Every foot-&s;oldier learns to handle the oar, at the &s;ame time as the mu&s;quet; by which means, without maritime commerce, and with|out embargoes, the Ru&s;&s;ians have always crews ready for their gallies. The&s;e, &s;ays Count <HI>Alzarotti,</HI> are here the proper things. Be there never &s;o little water, there is always enough for them; they glide between the little i&s;lands and the rocks, and can land any where. They are all armed with two pieces of cannon on the prow, and furni&s;hed with chace and &s;wivel-guns on the &s;ides. An army of 30,000 men is tran&s;ported in them with ea&s;e. They ca&s;t anchor every night, and land where it is lea&s;t expected. When di&s;embarked, they draw them up on land, range them in a circle, with their prows and artillery pointed outwards, and thus they have a fortified camp pre&s;ently. They leave five or
<PB N="237" REF="248">
&s;ix battalions to guard it; and, with the re&s;t of their troops, over-run the country, and lay it under contri|bution. The expedition ended, they re-embark, and begin again, in other quarters; and &s;ometimes they tran&s;port the&s;e ve&s;&s;els from one water to another, over a &s;teep of land, as was practi&s;ed by the ancients. The&s;e gallies are built at Peter&s;burgh, of a &s;pecies of oak, which is at lea&s;t two &s;ummers on the road before it ar|rives. It comes ready cut by the carpenters in the province of Ca&s;an, brought all the way by water.</P>
<P>Could Ru&s;&s;ia obtain a free pa&s;&s;age from the Black Sea, through the Dardanelles, into the Mediterraneax, which &s;he aims at, with Azoph and the Crimea in her hands, as it is, &s;he would then have a free navigation from all parts of the empire, by means of the rivers Tanais and Donetz, down to Azoph; that port would then be the grand magazine of all the commodities of the empire, where her &s;hips would load for di&s;tributing them through all the fouthern countries of Europe, and on the coa&s;t of Africa; at the &s;ame time that Peter&s;|burgh &s;ent them to all the northern ones. This trade would give them a new export, perhaps of more con|&s;equence than all the others put together, that of corn. The fine&s;t territories of Europe for hu&s;bandry, are &s;aid to be the tracts on the north of the Black Sea, includ|ing the province of the Ukraine. At pre&s;ent, the&s;e countries have no vent for &s;uch a product, and, there|fore, rai&s;e no more than for their own con&s;umption; but
<PB N="238" REF="249">
open the Dardanelles to them, and this territory would be much better for &s;upplying the be&s;t corn-markets in Europe, than tho&s;e which at pre&s;ent &s;upply them, and would gain the exclu&s;ive trade likewi&s;e of &s;erving them with naval &s;tores.</P>
<P>The Turks will never &s;ubmit to a Ru&s;&s;ian navi|gation, through the heart of Con&s;tantinople (which would be an overthrow of their empire); unle&s;s they were fir&s;t reduced to the la&s;t extremity. This will de|pend on the naval force of the two empires in the Black Sea.</P>
<P>Though capital puni&s;hments, except in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on, in this country, are apparently &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, they are not &s;o, in fact; for, though the criminal laws do not, <HI>literally,</HI> &s;entence malefactors to death, they &s;till con&s;ign many to that doom, through the medium of puni&s;hments; in &s;ome circum&s;tances, almo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, if not profe&s;&s;edly, fatal; which mock with the hopes of life, but, in reality, protract the horrors of death, and embitter, with delay, an even which rea&s;on wi&s;hes to be in&s;tantaneous: for, when we con&s;ider, that many felons expire under the infliction of the knout; that &s;e|veral are exhau&s;ted, by the fatigue of a long journey, to the remote&s;t regions of Siberia, a di&s;tance of 4,776 miles; and that the forlorn remnant peri&s;h, in general, prematurely, from the unwhol&s;omene&s;s of the mines; it will be difficult to view the doom of the&s;e unhappy
<PB N="239" REF="250">
outca&s;ts, in any other light, than that of a lingering execution.</P>
<P>According to the pre&s;ent penal laws, offenders are puni&s;hed in the following manner. Per&s;ons convicted of high-trea&s;on, are either beheaded, or impri&s;oned for life. Felons, after receiving the knout, having their no&s;trils torn, and their faces marked, are condemned, for life, to work in the mines of Ner&s;hink: petty of|fenders are either whipped with a kind of cat-o-nine tails, tran&s;ported into Siberia as coloni&s;ts, or &s;entenced to hard labour for a &s;tated period. Among the co|loni&s;ts, are included pea&s;ants, arbitrarily con&s;igned to bani&s;hment by their ma&s;ters, who are empowered to inflict this puni&s;hment, a&s;&s;igning only the cau&s;e of the offence.</P>
<P>All the&s;e per&s;ons, felons and others, are tran&s;ported, in &s;pring and autumn, from different parts of the Ru&s;|&s;ian dominions. They travel part of the way by water, and part by land; are chained in pairs, and fa&s;tened to a long rope: at night they are carried to different cot|tages, and guarded by the &s;oldiers who conduct them. When the whole troop arrive at Tobol&s;koi, the go|vernor a&s;&s;igns the coloni&s;ts who have been bred to han|dicraft trades, to different ma&s;ters in the town; others, he di&s;po&s;es of as va&s;&s;als, in the neighbouring country: the remainder of the coloni&s;ts go on to Irkut&s;kaja, where they are di&s;po&s;ed of by the governor, in the &s;ame
<PB N="240" REF="251">
manner. The felons then proceed, alone, to the di&s;|trict of Ner&s;hinkaja, where they are condemned to work in the &s;ilver mines, or at the different forges.</P>
<P>The knout, or knoot, is a thong about the thick|ne&s;s of a crown-piece, and about three-quarters of an inch broad, and rendered extremely hard, by a pecu|liar kind of preparation; it is tied to a thick, plaited whip, which is fa&s;tened, by an iron ring, like a flail, to a &s;hort, wooden handle. The executioner, before every &s;troke, recedes a few paces, drawing back his hand which holds the knoot, then bounding forwards, applies the fiat end of the thong, with con&s;iderable force, to the naked back of the criminal, in a perpen|dicular line, reaching &s;ix or &s;even inches from the col|lar to the wai&s;t. He begins by hitting the right &s;houl|der, and continues his &s;trokes, parallel to each other, quite to the left &s;houlder; nor does he cea&s;e, till he has given the number of la&s;hes, agreeable to the &s;en|tence, from one to three hundred, or more. The reader may judge of the great force which a &s;kilful ex|ecutioner can give to this in&s;trument, when he is told, that if he receives a private order, he can di&s;patch the criminal, by &s;triking him two or three blows upon the ribs. There are other ingenious contrivances to puni&s;h criminals, far wor&s;e than death; but as I tru&s;t the feeling of an Engli&s;h reader, will rather be excu&s;ed the relation of them.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="252">I will clo&s;e this &s;ubject, with &s;ome account of the pirates that infe&s;t the larger rivers, which is attributed to the &s;everities of the ma&s;ters of fi&s;heries to their va&s;|&s;als, near the mouths of the Jaik and the Wolga. When|ever they are warmly pur&s;ued, and di&s;tre&s;ted for &s;up|port, they run their ve&s;&s;els a&s;hore, turn Mahomedans, and put them&s;elves under the protection of the Per|&s;ians. The&s;e robbers often go in gangs of 30, 40, and &s;ometimes 80 per&s;ons, in row-boats, which carry from 20 to 30 hands; they equip them&s;elves with fire-arms, and their general practice is, to board immediately; for where a fierce re&s;i&s;tance is apprehended, they &s;eldom attack. Few of the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants tran&s;port any cargoes of value down the Wolga, without a convoy. The &s;oldiers who are &s;ent after them, are ordered to take them alive, from an apprehen&s;ion, that a latitude to kill, might, through the &s;trong temptation to plunder, in a &s;oldier's brea&s;t, &s;ubject the innocent to &s;uffer for the guilty.</P>
<P>The Armenians are generally intrepid, and fight bravely in defence of their property; but the Bour|lacks, who navigate the Wolga, are &s;o extremely inti|midated by the&s;e robbers, that, as &s;oon as they appear, they are panic-&s;truck. They &s;ubmit immediately; and the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el, or the merchant, being thus at their mercy, is happy to e&s;cape with life; if he attempts to defend him&s;elf, and is conquered, he may be &s;ure of being barbarou&s;ly murdered.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="253">As the cruelties of the&s;e men are very great, &s;o is their puni&s;hment, when taken. A float is built, in &s;ize according to the number of delinquents, and a gallows erected on it, to contain a &s;ufficient number of iron hooks, on which they are hung up alive by the ribs. The float is launched into the &s;tream, with labels over their heads, &s;ignifying their crimes, and orders are given, to all towns and villages, on the borders of the river, on pain of death, not only to afford no relief to any of the&s;e wretches, but to pu&s;h off the float, &s;hould it land near them. Sometimes, their partners in wickedne&s;s meet them, and, if there are any &s;igns of life, take them down, or &s;hoot them dead; but, if they are caught in the&s;e acts of illegal mercy, they are hung up, without the ceremony of a trial.&mdash;They tell of one of the&s;e mi&s;creants, who had the fortune to di&s;engage him|&s;elf from the hook, and though naked, and trembling with pain and lo&s;s of blood, got a&s;hore. The fir&s;t ob|ject he &s;aw, who could afford him any relief, was a poor &s;hepherd, who&s;e brains he beat out with a &s;tone, and then took his cloaths.&mdash;The&s;e malefactors &s;ometimes hang thus three or four days, and &s;ometimes five days alive. The pain generally produces a raging fever, or phrenzy, which carries them off, imploring the relief of water, with the mo&s;t horrid imprecations.</P>

<P>AS the Chine&s;e are at &s;o great a di&s;tance from us, and are &s;o very unwilling to admit foreigners among them, the be&s;t accounts of them we can col|lect, are from tho&s;e Je&s;uit mi&s;&s;ionaries who dwelt among them, and who traver&s;ed the whole empire, in order to make converts to chri&s;tianity. And, though the ac|counts we have received, from the&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries, have
<PB N="244" REF="256">
been written &s;ome years, yet, as the Chine&s;e are &s;o bigoted to their ancient cu&s;toms, and &s;o prejudiced in favour of what their ance&s;tors did, that the &s;ame u&s;ages, manners, &amp;c. which were prevalent in China 4000 years ago, have not been changed with time, but have con|tinued exactly the &s;ame for 40 centuries; we may rely on the faith of the&s;e men, and believe, that no alte|ration has taken place, within the la&s;t 50 or 60 years. As the per&s;ons employed, by the &s;everal India-com|panies in Europe, never penetrate further than into the &s;uburbs of Canton, we can learn very little from them.</P>
<P>Great Tartary and China are now united, and make but one mighty empire, comprending all the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the continent of A&s;ia. Chine&s;e Tartary is bound|ed on the north by Siberia, a va&s;t tract of country be|longing to the Ru&s;&s;ians, as we have &s;een in the &s;econd, third, and fourth volumes, of this work; on the ea&s;t, by the gulph of Kamt&s;chatka, another country of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire; and, on the we&s;t, by the country of the Kalmucks, e&s;tabli&s;hed between the Ca&s;ghar and the Ca&s;pian &s;ea. On the &s;outh, it is united to China, &s;eparated only by the famous wall, and, with this, makes but one empire; China extending to the Chine&s;e, or Great, South Sea.</P>
<P>This celebrated wall, of which &s;o many travellers have &s;poken, divides Chine&s;e Tartary from China, and
<PB N="245" REF="257">
was built 220 years before the birth of Chri&s;t. It was erected to defend China from that part of Tartary which is now become a branch of the empire; of cour&s;e, this a&s;toni&s;hing barrier, is become almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s. There is nothing in the whole world equal to this work, which is continued for 1200 miles, through three, great provinces, not only carried through low lands and vallies, but al&s;o over hills, and up the &s;teep brows of the highe&s;t mountains. One-third part of the able-bodied men in China, were employed in building it; and the workmen were enjoined, under pain of death, to place the materials of it &s;o clo&s;e, that the lea&s;t en|trance might not be left for any in&s;trument of iron. Its &s;olidity, therefore, has pre&s;erved it to this day en|tire. <HI>Verbie&s;t</HI> had the curio&s;ity to take the altitude of one of tho&s;e mountains over which it extends, and found it was 1,030 feet above the level of the &s;pot where he &s;tood; &s;o that it is built in places, which &s;eem inac|ce&s;&s;ible, and is &s;trengthened with a &s;eries of forts. The beginning of this wall, is a large, &s;tone bulwark, rai&s;ed in the &s;ea, to the ea&s;t of Peking, and reaches to the mountains near the city of Kin, on the yellow river; and, between the&s;e two places, it meets with no inter|ruption, except to the north of the city of Suen, in the province of Pe-tcheli, where it is intercepted by a ridge of hideous and inacce&s;&s;ible mountains, to which it is clo&s;ely united; and by the river Hoang-ho, which pa&s;&s;es through it, in its cour&s;e to the &s;ea. As to other rivers, of inferior &s;ize, arches have been con&s;tructed,
<PB N="246" REF="258">
like tho&s;e of a bridge, thro' which they find a pa&s;&s;age. It has no kind of &s;upport, but what is u&s;ually given to common walls, and is almo&s;t of the &s;ame form. The foundation con&s;i&s;ts of large blocks of &s;quare &s;tones, laid in mortar; but all the re&s;t is of brick. It is, through its whole length, wide enough for five or &s;ix hor&s;emen to travel a-brea&s;t, with ea&s;e; and, at the top, flat, and well paved with cut &s;tone. It is built like the walls of the common cities of the empire, terraced, and ca&s;ed with brick; and is from 20 to 25 feet high, with &s;quare towers, at the di&s;tance of two bow-&s;hots from each other, and embra&s;ures, at equal di&s;tances; and where it ri&s;es over a rock, or mountain, there is an a&s;cent, by ea&s;y, &s;tone-&s;tairs. Mr. <HI>Bell,</HI> who accompanied Captain <HI>I&s;mailof,</HI> in his emba&s;&s;y to Peking, in 1719, tells us, this wall was begun, and completely fini&s;hed, in the &s;hort &s;pace of five years; and, it is reported, that the labourers &s;tood &s;o clo&s;e for many miles, that they could hand the materials to one another. The whole is &s;o &s;trong, and well built, that it &s;carcely needs any repairs; and, in &s;uch a dry climate, may remain in he &s;ame condition for many ages. The gates of this wall are all &s;trongly fortified.</P>
<P>Before I proceed in the de&s;cription of this empire, I will give my readers a &s;hort account of the great revo|lution which happened in that part of the world, about 150 years ago, which united China with many Tartar kingdoms, and which &s;eated a Tartar prince upon the
<PB N="247" REF="259">
throne, and by who&s;e de&s;cendants it has been govern|ed ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>A king of Niuche, one of the little Tartar kingdoms, north-ea&s;t of China, complained of &s;ome abu&s;es put upon his people, by the Chine&s;e merchants; which not being redre&s;&s;ed, he re&s;olved to make repri&s;als; and, accordingly, invaded the province of Leo-tong, which lies without the great Chine&s;e wall. The Emperor &s;ent an army again&s;t the Tartar prince, and the war con|tinued &s;ome time, with various &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In the mean time, there happened a famine in &s;ome provinces of China, and the people, unable to pay the u&s;ual taxes, rebelled, under one <HI>Ly-cungz,</HI> their leader; and, to oppo&s;e this man, a great army was rai&s;ed; but this army de&s;erted to the rebels, who advanced to the city of Peking, and having a corre&s;pondence with the Emperor's eunuchs, who had then a principal &s;hare in the admini&s;tration, were treacherou&s;ly admitted with|in the walls, and had ab&s;olutely entered the palace-gates, before the Emperor had notice of their approach. The unfortunate prince, finding him&s;elf betrayed, re|&s;olved to break through the rebels, with 600 of his guards then about him, or peri&s;h in the attempt; but the&s;e, al&s;o, ba&s;ely abandoning him, he retired into a garden, with his only daughter, and having fir&s;t written a letter to <HI>Ly-cungz,</HI> advi&s;ing him to &s;pare his &s;ub|jects, he fir&s;t &s;tabbed his daughter, and then hanged

him&s;elf. The Empre&s;s, the governor of the city, and many more of the court, of both &s;exes, either to pre|vent the barbarous u&s;age they expected from the re|bels, or in compliment to the Emperor, cho&s;e to dye with him, and became their own executioners. The u&s;urper immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne, and exerci&s;ed all manner of cruelties on the poor citizens of Peking.</P>
<P>The u&s;urper then left a garri&s;on in Peking, and marched again&s;t the Chine&s;e general &s;ent out again&s;t the Tartar prince, carrying that general's father with him; and, having laid &s;iege to a town where that ge|neral had &s;hut him&s;elf up, he threatened to put his father to death, in the mo&s;t cruel manner he could in|vent, unle&s;s he &s;urrendered; and &s;oon after put his threats into execution. This general, who&s;e name was <HI>U&s;angucy,</HI> provoked by his father's death, and the de&s;truction of his prince, made pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce with the Tartars, and craved their a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the u&s;urper. Accord|ingly, they marched again&s;t him, with their united forces; but he fled back to Peking, where, having burnt and plundered his people, with the &s;poils, he retired into the province of Xen&s;i.</P>
<P>The citizens of Peking having &s;uffered much from the u&s;urper, con&s;idered the Tartars as their deliverers; and <HI>U&s;angucy</HI> leaving them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Peking, whil&s;t he pur&s;ued the rebel <HI>Ly-cungz,</HI> and the re&s;t of

The de&s;cendants of this man, have continued on the throne to the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>Great Tartary, with China, as now united, extends from 21 degrees north-latitude, to 55 degrees; &s;o that, the whole length, from north to &s;outh, is 34 degrees, or 2,040 Engli&s;h miles. If we extend it to 60 degrees north, as &s;ome do, and take in the i&s;land of Haynam in the &s;outh, which lies in 18 degrees of latitude, it makes the length of the empire 2,520 miles. In breadth, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, in mo&s;t places, it is 1,000 miles; and, con&s;equently, its circumference mu&s;t be 7,000 miles, and upwards.</P>
<P>China then is &s;o exten&s;ive, that all its provinces, of which there are 15, cannot enjoy the &s;ame temperature; their climate, and the nature of their &s;oil, varies, the nearer to, or more remote they are from the &s;outh. Severe cold is felt at Peking, whil&s;t the &s;outhern pro|vinces are expo&s;ed to exce&s;&s;ive heat. <HI>Mande&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oe</HI> &s;ays,

<P>The principal mountains of China, are in the north|ern and we&s;tern parts of the empire; and the latter are rendered fruitful, by the labour and indu&s;try of the in|habitants; but the former, being bleak and rocky, are uncultivated. Some are covered with fore&s;ts of tall, &s;trait trees, of every &s;pecies, fit for building, and &s;hip-timber; and very enormous trunks are &s;ometimes re|moved, to the di&s;tance of 300 leagues, by land and water-carriage, for public works. Other mountains are rich with quick&s;ilver, iron, tin, copper, gold, and &s;ilver; but the wi&s;dom and prudence of early dyna&s;ties, prevented the latter mines from being opened, le&s;t the people &s;hould be induced to neglect the natural riches of their &s;oil, by applying to other labours than tho&s;e of agriculture.</P>
<P>Super&s;titious natives relate &s;ome &s;ingular and extra|ordinary phenomena of their mountains. There are &s;everal, they &s;ay, which produce nothing but u&s;eful and &s;alutary herbs, and where nothing el&s;e will grow. They a&s;&s;ure us, that others have the property of render|ing tho&s;e immortal who retire to them; that a moun|tain
<PB N="251" REF="263">
of Chen&s;i, which has the figure of a large cock, crows &s;ometimes &s;o loud, that it may be heard at the di&s;tance of three leagues; that another, in the province of Fo-kien, trembles at the approach of a &s;torm, and &s;hakes to and fro, like a tree, agitated by the wind. But the Chine&s;e admire, above all others, a moun|tain of Fo-kien; the whole of which is an idol, or &s;tatue of the god, <HI>Fo.</HI> This colo&s;&s;us is of &s;o mon&s;trous a &s;ize, that each of its eyes is &s;everal miles in circum|ference, and its no&s;e &s;everal leagues in extent. It is very extraordinary, that the Chine&s;e, who con&s;ider a flat no&s;e as a beauty, &s;hould have given their favourite idol one of &s;o prodigious a length. But it evidently appears, that the &s;hape of this mountain is not the work of art. There are &s;ome mountains, however, that have been &s;haped by labour. Such are tho&s;e of the five hor&s;es heads, from their re&s;embling &s;uch. Some have very deep and &s;pacious caverns, excavated; and others are pierced through, for a great length. In that of the province of Fo-kien, near the city of Hen-goa, is a hand&s;ome terrace, &s;ix feet wide, 12 miles long, at the foot of two hills, paved all the way with broad &s;tones, and planted on each &s;ide with &s;hady trees, and benches to re&s;t on. There are many of the&s;e cau&s;eways, cut in the &s;ame manner; &s;ome between, others by the &s;ides of the mountains, with horrid precipices above and below: and others have &s;teps cut into the rock, from the bot|tom to the top.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="264">There are not wanting, in this country, volcanoes, or burning mountains; the mo&s;t remarkable, is that called Lino-&s;ing, which is very high, and vomits fire, cinders, and a&s;hes, and &s;ometimes torrents of &s;ulphur, and other minerals.</P>
<P>Though the gold mines here are not &s;uffered to be opened, the Chine&s;e carry on a good traffick in gold, having plenty of gold-&s;and wa&s;hed down, by torrents, from the&s;e mountains, in rainy &s;ea&s;ons, and caught by fleeces, and other &s;trainers, laid a-cro&s;s the water; or found among the &s;and and mud, of their rivers. Mul|titudes of people live wholly by this bu&s;ine&s;s of gather|ing gold, which is &s;o pure as to need no refining. As gold is not here coined, it is &s;old, like other mer|chandi&s;e; the Emperor is the only per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es any quantity of gold-plate. They have &s;ome few lead mines, but this mineral is very &s;carce.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides common copper, the Chine&s;e have another kind, which they call <HI>Pe-tang,</HI> or white copper; it is known in England, under the name of <HI>Tut-a-neg,</HI> and is &s;o pure and fine, that it approaches near to &s;ilver. A number of experiments have been made of it at Peking, which &s;ufficiently prove, that this copper does not owe its whitene&s;s to any mixture. Different works are made of it: but, to render it malleable, they mix it with a little zinc; and, to add to its colour, with a about a fifth part of &s;ilver. They have al&s;o a yellow copper, re&s;embling gold.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="265">On the &s;ea-coa&s;t, there are found many &s;alt-pits, the &s;alt of which is conveyed over all the empire; and the province of Kian-nan &s;upplies &s;uch a quantity, as to bring in 32 millions of ta&euml;ls (each ta&euml;l 6<HI>s.</HI> Engli&s;h), or 9,600,000&pound;. into the Emperor's trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>In &s;everal parts of the province of Honan, there is found a &s;ort of &s;alt-earth, which, being boiled and chry|&s;talized, makes a very good, white &s;alt; and, in &s;ome places, the ground, after rain, &s;pews up a kind of froth, which is made into an excellent &s;oap. The pro|vince of Quang&s;i, is famed for a yellow earth, which, taken internally, is an antidote to poi&s;on; and, by out|ward application, heals the bite of venemous creatures. There is here, al&s;o, a kind of earth, of a fine, ver|milion colour, and another of a beautiful white, which the ladies u&s;e as co&s;metics and rouge. The &s;ame pro|vince furni&s;hes, al&s;o, that valuable clay, in great abundance, of which the porcelain is made.</P>
<P>Quarries of marble, and coal-mines, are &s;o abundant in every province of the empire, that there is, perhaps, no country in the world where it is &s;o plentiful; but they make not much u&s;e of the marble in their public buildings. Here are al&s;o to be found, in many places, lapis lazuli; and the mo&s;t beautiful rock-chry&s;tal in the world, of which they make &s;eals, buttons, and a variety of toys. The province of Yun-nan furni&s;hes real rubies, but they are very &s;mall: the neighbouring
<PB N="254" REF="266">
kingdom of Laos, however, has a mine full of preciou&s; &s;tones, from which rubies are dug, &s;ometimes as large as a walnut. Emeralds are al&s;o found there. The king of Laos has one in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, equal in &s;ize to an orange; but many are w&s;hed down the current, by a river that cro&s;&s;es this mountain, that weigh a quarter, or a third part of an ounce.</P>
<P>In various channels made by torrents, and in rivers flowing at the bottom of mountains, are found certain &s;onorous &s;tones, re&s;embling tho&s;e pebbles which are found in the &s;treams, that ru&s;h down through the clefts of mountains. This &s;tone is called <HI>Yu;</HI> large ones are very rare. The bigge&s;t yet found, was only three feet long, and about 22 inches broad.</P>
<P>Five di&s;tinct properties are remarked in this &s;tone; hardne&s;s, weight, colour, grain, and &s;ound. Beautiful <HI>Yu</HI> are &s;o hard, that, when cut and poli&s;hed like agate, the be&s;t tempered &s;teel glides upon them, without making any impre&s;&s;ion. The more careful Nature has been in their formation, the more difficult it is to cut them; but, the harder they are, the better poli&s;h they receive.</P>
<P>The weight of the <HI>Yu</HI> is proportionable to its hard|ne&s;s. An unpoli&s;hed block, in the Emperor's palace, which, to all appearance, one man can lift, it mea&s;ur|ing no more than 30 inches by 6, cannot be moved, but
<PB N="255" REF="267">
by four men. It is of an irregular figure, and has a green colour; but the mo&s;t e&s;teemed colour, is that of whey; though there are &s;ome of a bright blue, azure, indigo, citron-yellow, orange, logwood-red, pale green, &s;ea-green, deep green, cinder-grey, &amp;c. and &s;ome vari|egated, in veins and &s;hades. The hardie&s;t and heavie&s;t, have always the fine&s;t grain. The <HI>Yu</HI> emits &s;parks, when &s;truck with &s;teel, and re&s;embles agate.</P>
<P>But the rare&s;t quality of this &s;tone, is its &s;inging, or &s;ounding when &s;truck, and yielding an excellent tone. Various &s;tones yield various &s;ounds, according to their grain and hardne&s;s. Very hard &s;tones are exceedingly &s;onorous; &s;ome &s;oft ones, emit a very &s;weet &s;ound; and there are others, as light as a pumice-&s;tone, which give a very agreeable &s;ound. Of the&s;e &s;tones, the Chine&s;e make mu&s;ical in&s;truments.</P>
<P>The chemi&s;ts and naturali&s;ts of Europe have never yet attempted to find out whether &s;ome of our &s;tones may not have the &s;ame properties. The Romans were certainly acquainted with a &s;onorous &s;tone, for <HI>Pliny,</HI> when &s;peaking of curious &s;tones, ob&s;erves, that the &s;tone called <HI>Calcophonas,</HI> or brazen &s;ound, is black; and that, according to the etymology of its name, &s;ent forth, when &s;truck, a &s;ound like that of bra&s;s. His words are: <HI>Calcophonas nigra e&s;t; &s;ed illi&s;a, aeris tinnitum reddit.</HI> lib. xxxvii. &s;ect. 56.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="268">The Chine&s;e tell us, that this &s;tone was known in their country, &s;o early as 206 years before the Xtian era; and was then the mo&s;t valuable pre&s;ent that could be made to the Emperor. The mu&s;ical in&s;trument made in China of this &s;tone, is called <HI>king.</HI> Such an in&s;tru|ment was brought to France, and the late Duke of <HI>Chaulnes</HI> took great pains to &s;earch into the nature of the &s;tone: the re&s;ult of his enquiries is, that it is a &s;pecies of black marble; this &s;tone, re&s;embling ex|ternally what we call touch-&s;tone. He accordingly had a <HI>king</HI> made of the black marble of Flanders, and it was almo&s;t as &s;onorous as that from China; but the &s;tone Yu, of which the Chine&s;e form their mo&s;t beautiful <HI>king,</HI> is nothing more than a kind of agate.</P>
<P>Among a number of lakes, one of which is 80 leagues in circumference, and another, in the province of Kiang-&s;i, 100 leagues in length, &s;ubject, like the &s;ea, to &s;torms and tempe&s;ts; I &s;ay, among the&s;e, and an in|finity of great and &s;mall rivers, that water this va&s;t em|pire, there are two particularly celebrated. The fir&s;t is the Yang-t&s;e-Kiang; or Son of the Sea. It ri&s;es in Yun-nen; and, after flowing through an extent of 400 leagues, and watering four provinces, empties it&s;elf into the Ea&s;tern &s;ea, forming an i&s;land at its mouth, from the &s;and it throws up. The Chine&s;e have a pro|verb, viz.&mdash;<Q>The &s;ea hath no bounds, and Kiang no bottom.</Q>&mdash;Before Nanking, and at the di&s;tance
<PB N="257" REF="269">
of 30 leagues from its mouth, it is half a league wide. Its navigation is dangerous; and a number of ve&s;&s;els are lo&s;t in it almo&s;t every day. It flows with great ra|pidity, from &s;everal i&s;lands in its cour&s;e; produces a multitude of reeds, from 10 to 12 feet high, which &s;erves the provinces, through which it pa&s;&s;es, with fuel; but when &s;welled with torrents, carries away the greater part of the&s;e i&s;lands, and forms others, from their wrecks.</P>
<P>The other great river is, the Hoang-ho, or yellow river; &s;o called, from the yellowne&s;s of its water, oc|ca&s;ioned, in time of rain, by the yellow clay and &s;and wa&s;hed into it. This ri&s;es in the mountains which bor|der the province of Te-tchuen on the we&s;t; and, after a cour&s;e of near 600 leagues, a-cro&s;s Tartary and China, di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Ea&s;tern &s;ea, not far from the mouth of the Kiang. It is very broad and rapid, but &s;o &s;hallow, as &s;carce to be navigable; yet often overflows its banks, and drowns whole villages. Precautions are taken to prevent this, by dikes; but the&s;e do not entirely free the neighbourhood from fear of inundation. The inhabitants of the province of Honan, to avert this evil, have &s;urrounded mo&s;t of their cities, at the di&s;tance of three furlongs, with &s;trong ramparts of earth, faced with turf.</P>
<P>The ingenuity which the Chine&s;e di&s;play in turning the happy &s;ituation of their lakes and rivers to the
<PB N="258" REF="270">
be&s;t advantage, is the admiration of all Europe. One of their chief works for the convenience of trade, is the celebrated Royal canal, 600 leagues in length, reach|ing from Canton to Peking, and forming a commu|nication between all the &s;outhern and northern pro|vinces. Its navigation being no where interrupted, but by the mountain Meiling, where pa&s;&s;engers are obliged to travel ten or twelve leagues over land; but, if they will go &s;ome way round, through the provinces of Quang-&s;i and Hou-quang, they need not quit their barks at all. It may readily be conceived, what im|men&s;e labour it mu&s;t have co&s;t, to form a commu|nication between &s;o many rivers, and how many ob|&s;tacles mu&s;t have occurred, in a canal of &s;o va&s;t an extent, in the cour&s;e of which they have overcome the re&s;i&s;tance of Nature, with dikes, moles, &amp;c. In this principal canal, a number of others end, which &s;tretch out into the country, and form a communication be|tween the cities, towns, and villages, as they pa&s;s. The patience and per&s;everance of the Chine&s;e, in the&s;e u&s;e|ful undertakings, have &s;urmounted ob&s;tacles, that would have di&s;couraged any other people. Such, for ex|ample, is part of a canal from Chao king to Ning-po. Near the&s;e cities, there are two canals, the waters of which do not communicate; one being 12 feet above the level of the other. To render this place pa&s;&s;able for boats, for they have not yet the art of making flood-gates, as in Europe; they have con&s;tructed a dou|ble glacis of large &s;tones, or rather two inclined planes,
<PB N="259" REF="271">
which unite in an acute angle at their upper extremity, like the ridge of a barn, and extend, on each &s;ide, to the &s;urface of the water. If the bark is in the lower canal, they draw it up the plane of the fir&s;t glacis, by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of &s;everal cap&s;tans, till it reaches the angle; when, by its own weight, it &s;lides down the &s;econd glacis, into the water of the higher canal, with the velocity of an arrow; and, it is wonderful, that the&s;e barks, which are generally very long and heavy laden, never bur&s;t a&s;un|der, when balanced in the air, on the edge of this acute angle. They are indeed con&s;tructed for the purpo&s;e, and no &s;uch accident ever happens.</P>
<P>Though their &s;kill in navigation is but poor, yet, as there is &s;carce a city, or a village, throughout the em|pire, e&s;pecially in the &s;outhern provinces, but what en|joys the convenience of a navigable river, dike, canal, or arm of the &s;ea; wherever there is a town upon the &s;hore, there is another of boats upon the water; and &s;ome ports are &s;o blocked up with ve&s;&s;els, that it will take &s;everal hours to get cro&s;s them, to land. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els are made as commodious as hou&s;es; and there are many born here, and die in them; and, on board, they keep hogs, poultry, dogs, and other dome&s;tic ani|mals, as if they were on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, there are a prodigious number of floats of timber, perpetually going up and down the rivers and canals, which carry whole villages of people
<PB N="260" REF="272">
on them. This timber is cut chiefly in the province of Su-chuen, adjoining to India, on the we&s;t. The&s;e floats are &s;ome of them a mile in length, ri&s;ing two or three feet above the water, on which the people build little wooden huts, or cabins, at equal di&s;tances, where they live, till they have di&s;po&s;ed of the timber on which they are built. Great quantities of it are thus con|veyed as far as Peking, being above 300 leagues from the place where it is cut.</P>
<P>The Emperor has 9,999 large ve&s;&s;els in his &s;ervice, in the &s;outhern provinces. <HI>Magaillans</HI> &s;ays, they affect this number, becau&s;e 9, with them, &s;ounds very pom|pous. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els <HI>(Kieou)</HI> are as large as &s;hips, from 100 to 1000 tons burden, and yet they work them with great dexterity, with a few hands. They are flat-bot|tomed, the head and &s;tern &s;quare, but the fore-part not quite &s;o broad as the &s;tern, and the &s;tern open in the middle, to the end, that the rudder, which they &s;hut up as in a chamber, may be defended from the waves. They have a main-ma&s;t, and a fore-ma&s;t. The fore-ma&s;t has a yard, and a &s;quare &s;ail; but the &s;ail of the main-ma&s;t is narrow at top, like a &s;loop's &s;ail. Their ma&s;ts are not pieced, as ours are, and &s;et one on the head of the other, but are one &s;ingle tree, prodigou&s;ly high and thick, and &s;trongly &s;iezed by two &s;ide-beams, that &s;trengthen it wonderfully. Their &s;ails are made of a thick matt, &s;trengthened with laths, or &s;plit cane, at about two feet di&s;tance. Upon the deck they build
<PB N="261" REF="273">
little rooms, or cabins, from one end to the other, rai&s;ed about &s;even or eight feet high, painted and gilded within and without, and &s;o very neat and commodious, as to make the longe&s;t voyage tolerable. The mandarins, or great officers of &s;tate, often travel together in this man|ner, and no where &s;pend their hours more agreeably; for here they vi&s;it each other without ceremony, and play, and pa&s;s away their time, as if they were of one family; which freedoms are never taken, by ma|gi&s;trates, on &s;hore. All &s;hips carry frightful images of their gods, and have altars, and lamps burning before them.</P>
<P>The canals are often lined, on each &s;ide, to the depth of 10 or 12 feet, with fine, &s;quare, free-&s;tone; and, in &s;ome places, with grey marble. Some have banks, 20 or 25 feet high, on each &s;ide, &s;o as to require a great number of engines to rai&s;e the water into the fields over them. Some are cut more than ten leagues in a &s;traight line. The canal, north-we&s;t of the city of Hang-tcheou, is lined on each &s;ide with free-&s;tone, with a &s;tone cau&s;eway on the top; and hou&s;es are built on each bank, as clo&s;e together as tho&s;e in a &s;treet, and are as full of people; and both &s;ides of the canal are covered with barks. A number of &s;tone-bridges are thrown over the&s;e canals, of from three to &s;even arches; the middle one, always high enough to let a bark pa&s;s, without taking down the ma&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="274"><HI>Nieuhoff</HI> &s;ays, the &s;hips of the Emperor, and gover|nors of provinces, lie in the water like ca&s;tles; and are divided into apartments for all the u&s;es of &s;tate and con|venience, and are very well furni&s;hed. The windows and doors are made, like grates, with thin, tran&s;parent oy&s;ter-&s;hells, in&s;tead of gla&s;s; or el&s;e fine linen, or &s;ilk, &s;pread with clear wax, ornamented with flowers. Galleries are made without, and the in&s;ide is painted with all manner of curious colours. The timber-work is &s;o well jointed with oakum, that there is &s;carce any appearance of iron-work.&mdash;I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the&s;e barks again, when I mention their modes of travelling.&mdash;The &s;hips which carry fi&s;h, called <HI>Saull,</HI> and the Emperor's &s;ilks, to court, are 365 in number, finely gilt, within and without, and painted red; and all other ve&s;&s;els &s;trike &s;ail to the&s;e. In the province of Nanking, there is a multitude of plea&s;ure-boats, richly gilt and painted, and more like hou&s;es than &s;hips, in which many of the Chine&s;e &s;pend their e&s;tates; and there is &s;uch a va&s;t number of ve&s;&s;els in Fo-kien, that <HI>Nieuhoff</HI> &s;ays, the inhabitants offered the Emperor, when he was going to war with the Japane&s;e, to make him a bridge of boats, which &s;hould reach from China to Japan (two day's &s;ail). Indeed, there is &s;uch a con|tinual and uninterrupted plying of boats, from one place to another, over all the &s;outhern provinces, and navigable rivers, and the&s;e &s;o numerous, that the country re&s;embles &s;o many Venices, where all the ways and &s;treets are canals.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="275">But, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ailing on their rivers and canals, is exceedingly plea&s;ant in general, it is &s;ome|times very dangerous, from the &s;everal, rapid torrents they have to pa&s;s. <HI>Le Comte</HI> tells us, he was once on &s;uch a &s;tream, when the ve&s;&s;el was whirled round with an incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, for a con&s;iderable time, and at la&s;t da&s;hed upon a rock. That in the province of Fo-kien, for eight or ten days &s;ail, ve&s;&s;els are in continual danger of peri&s;hing; for there are &s;o many cataracts, and rocky &s;traights, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible for the boats to pa&s;s through, without being da&s;hed to pieces, on one &s;ide or other. Every day, almo&s;t, &s;ome ve&s;&s;el or other is &s;hipwrecked in the&s;e torrents; but they have often the good fortune to &s;plit near the &s;hores, and the pa&s;&s;engers are &s;aved, though &s;ometimes the ve&s;&s;el is da&s;hed to pieces, and the crew buried in a moment. They are u&s;ually under &s;ail, or tugged with ropes; but, on great rivers, and in cro&s;&s;ing lakes, oars are made u&s;e of. The Chine&s;e, continues <HI>Le Comte,</HI> who was often in their perilous voyages, have a knack of &s;ailing, in rapid torrents, which is wonderful and incredible. They, in a manner, force Nature, and make a voyage without any dread, which other nations would even look at with horror. In &s;ome of their rivers, the cataracts are continually broken by a thou&s;and points of rocks, that &s;carce leave breadth enough for the pa&s;&s;age of a bark. Nothing but turnings and windings, water-falls, and contrary currents, that da&s;h one again&s;t another, and hurry a boat, like an arrow from a bow. You are
<PB N="264" REF="276">
always within two feet of &s;helves; and, if you avoid one, you fall upon another, and from that to a third; yet the pilot, with a &s;kill not &s;ufficiently to be admired, e&s;capes &s;hipwreck every moment. There is no people in the world capable of undertaking &s;uch voyages, but the Chine&s;e; who are not di&s;couraged at the daily wrecks that happen, and who, if they carried double the num|ber of men, fifteen in&s;tead of eight, would avoid many of the&s;e calamities; but they would rather hazard their effects and their lives, than be at a trifling charge, more than they thought ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Their barks, however, are con&s;tructed accordingly. They are divided into five or &s;ix apartments; &s;o that, if they touch upon a rock, and make a breach in one, the others are water-tight, and keep them a-float till they can &s;top the hole; and, to moderate the rapidity of the motion, in places where the water is not too deep, they check the velocity of the ve&s;&s;el, by thru&s;ting a pole to the bottom, and bearing again&s;t it; &s;o that, when the torrent is even and uniform, let it be as rapid as it will, the boat flows as &s;lowly as on the calme&s;t channel: but when it winds in and out, they have recour&s;e to a double rudder, made in the fa&s;hion of an oar, 40 or 50 feet long, which the mariners manage with &s;uch &s;kill and dexterity, to drive their ve&s;&s;el on, or turn it right, as they would have it, to fall ju&s;t into the &s;tream, to &s;hun one rock without da&s;hing on another, to cut a
<PB N="265" REF="277">
current, or pur&s;ue the fall of the water, without dip|ping headlong into it.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e have had &s;tout &s;hips from all anti|quity; which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, accounts for their ad|dre&s;s in navigation. They boa&s;t the invention of the mariner's compa&s;s, though they have made very little improvement in it. As they have never been expo&s;ed to the nece&s;&s;ity of fighting naval battles, except on the river Kiang, round and near their own coa&s;ts, or in the neighbourhood of the i&s;les of Japan, they are bad &s;ailors, in an open &s;ea. Of ve&s;&s;els de&s;tined for &s;ea-engagements, they have &s;everal kinds. Tho&s;e belong|ing to the port of Canton, are much larger than tho&s;e employed on the coa&s;ts of Fo-kien; the latter are built only of fir, whereas, the ve&s;&s;els at Canton, are con|&s;tructed of iron-wood. In naval battles, they are found to be much &s;tronger and more u&s;eful, though they are heavy, and &s;low &s;ailors. But the&s;e ve&s;&s;els la&s;t a long time, and worms never pierce them. They have fa&s;t &s;ailing ve&s;&s;els, for pur&s;uing pirates, and carrying di&s;patches, that draw from &s;ix to &s;even feet water, and no weather prevents them from putting to &s;ea. They have others, to open the waves, that draw only three or four feet water; the&s;e have a &s;harp prow, a helm, a &s;ail, and four oars, and will carry from 30 to 50 &s;ol|diers. The&s;e, they &s;ay, fear neither wind nor billows. The anchors are made of iron-wood.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="278">They have al&s;o other ve&s;&s;els, to run among &s;and-banks, con&s;tructed with a flat bottom, for gliding along the coa&s;ts of the northern &s;ea, where there is little depth of water; but their be&s;t ve&s;&s;els, the &s;wifte&s;t and lighte&s;t for &s;ailing, are the hawk's-bill ve&s;&s;els, the prow and poop of which are built in the &s;ame manner, &s;o as that they can advance, or retreat, without putting about; and the decks are defended, on each &s;ide, by a kind of parapet, made of bamboo, which &s;helters the rowers, and the &s;oldiers, from the weapons of the enemy.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are armed with cannon. Each &s;hip has a captain, as ours have, but his bu&s;ine&s;s is only to keep the crew in awe, and victual them. In &s;ea-en|gagements, the &s;oldiers will place a pair of corks under their arms, throw them&s;elves into the &s;ea, and, with their &s;cymitars, attack their enemy, as actively as if on land.<HI>&mdash;(The plate repre&s;ents an attack by pyrates, in one of their large canals.)&mdash;</HI>But, with all this adroitne&s;s and courage, it may ea&s;ily be perceived, that a whole fleet of &s;uch armed barks, would not be able to &s;tand an attack from only a few of our European &s;hips of war. And if, at the clo&s;e of this naval account of the Chine&s;e, we may hazard a reflection&mdash;fifty years hence may put them on another &s;y&s;tem of naval war, when they will, probably, have &s;uch powerful neighbours as the Engli&s;h colonies in New Zealand may hereafter prove to them.</P>

<HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Productions.</HEAD>
<P>ALL travellers agree in their accounts of the fer|tility of China, and of the extent and beauty of its plains; neither enclo&s;ures, hedges, or ditches, are &s;een in them; &s;carce even a &s;ingle tree; &s;o careful is the hu&s;bandman not to lo&s;e an inch of his land. The northern plains, produce wheat; the &s;outhern, being low and watery, rice. In many places, the ground yields two crops a-year; and in the interval, between the harve&s;ts, the people will &s;ow &s;everal &s;orts of pul&s;e, and other &s;mall grain; and yet, famines are frequent in this country: and why? becau&s;e, in times of &s;carcity, the Chine&s;e, from their &s;ituation, can receive no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from their neighbours, and are often under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upplying them.</P>
<P>Their neighbours on the north are the Mongol, or Mogul Tartars, tributaries indeed to China; but a people &s;o extremely lazy, &s;owing millet only for their own u&s;e, and living principally on fle&s;h.</P>
<P>On the north-ea&s;t, the province of Leao-tong is very fertile, but too far from Peking to &s;end its provi&s;ions there. Be&s;ides, all carriage is impracticable, but in winter, when provi&s;ion is tran&s;ported frozen.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="281">Korea does not &s;upply China with corn; and as to Japan, on the ea&s;t, though only three or four days &s;ail from the continent, no Chine&s;e ve&s;&s;el ever yet attempted to go there for provi&s;ions; the Japane&s;e either having nothing to &s;pare, or foreign merchants meeting there with too many in&s;ults.</P>
<P>The other i&s;lands, &s;o far from being able to &s;upply China, are often in want of a &s;upply them&s;elves. What prevents famines in Europe, is the facility with which one country can be &s;upplied from another; but China is de&s;titute of this advantage. Situated, alone, in the extremity of A&s;ia, &s;urrounded by barbarous nations, it mu&s;t procure, from its own &s;oil, &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment for its numerous inhabitants, or a famine will en&s;ue. To avert this calamity, is the con&s;tant, grand object of its publlc mini&s;ters. Granaries and magazines are erected in every province, and in mo&s;t of the prin|cipal cities, for the relief of the people, in times of &s;carcity.</P>
<P>China, in its va&s;t extent, contains almo&s;t every &s;pe|cies of tree known in Europe, and, in the mountains, in the province of Tche-kiang, grow pines, &s;o large, that 40 men may be inclo&s;ed in their trunks: but I &s;hall only de&s;cribe &s;uch trees as are peculiar to this country.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="282">One is the tallow-tree, the &s;ize of our cherry-tree. Its branches are crooked, its leaves &s;haped like a heart, and of a bright, red colour. It has a &s;mooth bark, a &s;hort trunk, and its top is round and bu&s;hy. The fruit is contained in a rind, which, when ripe, and opened, divides into three parts, like a che&s;nut, and about the &s;ize of a walnut. It is the pulp with which the&s;e ker|nels are covered, that has the properties of tallow, and of which candles are made. Not having the art of pu|rifying it, as we do our tallow, it has a di&s;agreeable &s;mell, produces a thick &s;moke, and a faint light; but they mix it with lin&s;eed-oil, which &s;oftens and &s;weetens it.</P>
<P>The next is their wax-tree, which produces a white wax, almo&s;t equal in quality to bees-wax. This wax is depo&s;ited by a &s;mall worm that buries it&s;elf in the bark, and forms there a kind of comb, much &s;maller than a honey-comb. There are two trees in this country, and two only, that afford food to this in&s;ect; and, of cour&s;e, two only from which they can gather wax. One thrives be&s;t in dry, &s;andy &s;oils; the other, in moi&s;t, watry places. The fir&s;t being of a &s;hrubby kind, thrives in the wor&s;t of &s;oils, and will grow in any cli|mate. Walls may be covered with it, 10 or 12 feet high; and hedges made of it, in the open fields. The in&s;ect that frequents this tree, does not naturally attach it&s;elf to it, but mu&s;t be placed there. This operation is not difficult; and the tree once &s;tocked, always retains
<PB N="270" REF="283">
them. At the approach of winter, &s;mall tumours are ob&s;erved in the bark, which increa&s;e, till they are as large as walnuts. The&s;e are &s;o many ne&s;ts filled with the eggs of the in&s;ect, which are called <HI>Pe-la-tching.</HI> When the tree &s;hoots forth its blo&s;&s;oms in &s;pring, it gives life to the in&s;ects that cover it. This is the &s;ea|&s;on to depo&s;it ne&s;ts on tho&s;e trees that have none; which is thus done: &s;mall bundles of &s;traw are made, on each of which &s;even or eight ne&s;ts are placed; the&s;e bundles are tied to the branches, &s;o as to place the ne&s;ts imme|diately on the bark. When the in&s;ects are hatched, they run upon the branches, di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves over the leaves, and perforate the bark, under which they retire; but always come forth, at the proper &s;ea&s;on for making their wax.</P>
<P>About the middle of June, this wax makes its ap|pearance; fir&s;t, like the fine filaments of &s;oft wool, ri&s;ing from the bark, and enclo&s;ing the body of the in&s;ect; by degrees, the&s;e filaments become a kind of down, and &s;o, thicker and thicker, during the &s;ummer-heats, till it forms a cru&s;t, defending the animal from heat, rain, and ants. This cru&s;t is the wax, which is gathered before the hoar-fro&s;ts come, in September. The Chine&s;e &s;ay, if the wax was left too long on the tree, the in&s;ects would not make their ne&s;ts. The wax is white and bright, and pre&s;erves its tran&s;parency, to the depth of an inch. If an ounce of it is added to a pound of oil, it forms a wax, little inferior to bee's-wax.
<PB N="271" REF="284">
It is u&s;ed, al&s;o, to heal wounds, prevent &s;woon|ings, and allay palpitations of the heart.</P>
<P>The next curious tree they have, is their <HI>T&s;i-chu,</HI> or varni&s;h-tree, who&s;e bark and leaves re&s;emble tho&s;e of the a&s;h, but bears neither fruit nor flowers. It &s;eldom grows higher than about 15 feet; or larger in the trunk, than about two feet, or two feet and an half in girth. The varni&s;h procured from this tree, is a kind of gum, di&s;tilled only in &s;ummer-nights, from inci&s;ions made in the bark, drop by drop, into &s;mall &s;hells, placed to receive it in. A thou&s;and trees, in one night, will yield about 20 pounds of varni&s;h.</P>
<P>This varni&s;h is not extracted by the owner of the trees, but by merchants, who purcha&s;e a grove of them for the &s;ea&s;on, at the rate of three-pence a foot. One workman is &s;ufficient for 50 feet of timber, and his pay is, an ounce of &s;ilver per month. Whil&s;t this varni&s;h flows, it exhales a malignant vapour, the bad effects of which is prevented, by the workmen anointing their faces and hands with rape-oil, in which a quantity of tho&s;e fle&s;hy filaments are boiled, that are found in hog's lard, and which do not melt. After eating, they wa&s;h their whole bodies with a decoction of che&s;nut-tree bark, mixed with certain drugs; and, when at work near the trees, put their heads in a &s;ail-cloth bag, in which there are two holes for their eyes, and cover their bodies with a doe-&s;kin apron, tied round their
<PB N="272" REF="285">
necks and wai&s;ts; with boots of the &s;ame on their legs, and coverings on their arms. Without this precaution, a collector of varni&s;h would be puni&s;hed for his ra&s;h|ne&s;s. He would be &s;oon afflicted, as with a univer&s;al lepro&s;y, and would fall a &s;acrifice to the di&s;temper, if not relieved by tho&s;e remedies that are &s;ometimes ap|plied, with &s;ucce&s;s, in &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>
<P>When the varni&s;h is collected, it is put into &s;mall ca&s;ks, clo&s;ely &s;topped; a pound of it, newly made, co&s;ts him about 20<HI>d.</HI> &s;terling, and he &s;ells it at a profit of <HI>cent. per cent.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the lu&s;tre and beauty this varni&s;h gives to many of the Chine&s;e manufactures, it has the property of pre&s;erving the wood from dampne&s;s and worms. It often happens, that the glo&s;s of varni&s;hed tables, and other furniture, is in&s;en&s;ibly de&s;troyed by tea, and other warm liquors; but the &s;ecret of re&s;toring to this varni&s;h its &s;hining, black colour, &s;ays a Chine&s;e author, is to expo&s;e it, for one night, to a white, hoar-fro&s;t; or to cover it, &s;ome time, with &s;now;&mdash;a method any of our readers, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch varni&s;hed wood, may readily try.</P>
<P>A fourth tree peculiar to this country is, the <HI>Tie-ly-mou,</HI> or iron-wood, which grows to the height of our large oaks. Of this wood, the Chine&s;e make their anchors,
<PB N="273" REF="286">
as I have ob&s;erved before, it being exceedingly hard, and &s;o heavy as to &s;ink in water.</P>
<P>A fifth is, the <HI>Nan-mou,</HI> or Chine&s;e cedar. This tree is one of the talle&s;t they have; its branches &s;hoot up vertically, grow from the bark only to a certain height, and terminate in a bu&s;h, or tufted top. Though called a cedar, its leaves are not like the cedar of Lebanon. Its wood here is con&s;idered as not liable to decay. All the palace-pillars, beams and doors, are made of this timber.</P>
<P>The <HI>T&s;e-tan,</HI> or ro&s;e-wood, is the next uncommon tree, and the mo&s;t beautiful and valuable wood the Chine&s;e have. It is of a black colour, inclining to red, &s;haped and variegated with delicate veins, which re&s;emble painting: we have &s;een this wood in England.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tchang,</HI> or camphire tree, is al&s;o a production of China. Some of them are above 100 cubits high, and &s;o large in the trunk, that 20 per&s;ons cannot en|clo&s;e them. When old, the bodies of the&s;e trees will emit &s;parks of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e; but their flame is &s;o &s;ubtle, as not to injure even the hair of tho&s;e who are near it. Com|mon camphire, at Peking, is only one penny Engli&s;h per ounce, but it is inferior to that of Borneo. The camphire is obtained from this tree, by chopping the branches very &s;mall, &s;teeping them for three days in
<PB N="274" REF="287">
&s;pring-water, and afterwards boiling them, &s;tirring them with a willow-&s;tick. When they perceive the &s;ap of this chopped wood adhere to the &s;tick, in the form of white fro&s;t, they &s;train it, and throw away the dregs. Next morning this decoction will coagulate, and form a &s;olid ma&s;s, which is afterwards purified by another proce&s;s.</P>
<P>They have another tree, called the <HI>Siang,</HI> which grows as tall as our che&s;nut-trees, and bears a fruit which dyers u&s;e as a &s;ub&s;titute for the gall-nut. It grows in barren and mountainous countries.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o a kind of pine-tree, called <HI>Keou-ouai,</HI> which grows in Tartary. Its wood is very hard, &s;oon petrifies, and is converted into hones to &s;harpen tools; but its &s;ap is poi&s;onous, and if any drops &s;purt on the &s;kin of the woodman, it rai&s;es incurable bli&s;ters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tcha-k&eacute;</HI> is another uncommon tree, that grows in the northern coa&s;ts of China. It has no bark, and will, when green, burn as readily as the drie&s;t wood. It makes very good charcoal, that burns free, without either &s;mell or &s;moke.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tchu-kou,</HI> or paper-tree, is of great value to the Chine&s;e, the inner rind furni&s;hing them with the greate&s;t part of their paper. When its branches are broken, the bark peels off, in form of long ribbands. It is a kind
<PB N="275" REF="288">
of &s;ycamore, and &s;omething like the wild mulberry, but bears fruit like the fig, being full of milk, and adher|ing to the branches without a &s;talk. It grows on the mountains, in a rocky &s;oil. The paper is made of the bark.</P>
<P>In the province of Quang-&s;i, they have a tree, which, in&s;tead of pith, contains a &s;oft pulp, yielding a kind of flour; and the bread made of it, is &s;aid to be ex|ceedingly good.</P>
<P>The <HI>T&s;e &s;ong-yuen-pe,</HI> or juniper-cypre&s;s, is one of the &s;ingularities of nature, partaking of the properties both of the juniper and cypre&s;s, in leaves and branches; &s;ome re&s;embling the juniper, others, the cypre&s;s. When the tree is young, its leaves are like tho&s;e of the for|mer; when old, like tho&s;e of the latter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bamboo</HI> we are acquainted with. It is a kind of reed, which grows to the height and &s;ize of large trees. Although the trunk is hollow, and divided at certain &s;paces by knots, it is very &s;trong, and capable of &s;u&s;taining enormous weight. The&s;e reeds are u&s;ed as pipes to convey water. Split and divided into thin &s;lips, they weave them into mats; and paper is made from a pa&s;te procured from them, by brui&s;ing them, and &s;teeping them in water; and canoes, or wherries, are al&s;o built with them. In &s;ome parts of China, there are whole fore&s;ts of them.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="289">The cotton-&s;hrub is one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful in all China. On the &s;ame day that hu&s;bandmen get in their harve&s;t, they &s;ow cotton in the &s;ame field, merely raking the earth over the &s;eeds. As &s;oon as the land is moi&s;t|ened with rain, or dew, a &s;hrub grows up, about two feet high, the flowers of which appear about the middle of Augu&s;t, generally yellow, but &s;ometimes red; to this flower &s;ucceeds a button, in the &s;hape of a pod, about the &s;ize of a nut. Forty days after the appearance of the flower, the pod opens, and yields three or four wrappings of cotton, extremely white, and of the &s;ame figure as the cod of a &s;ilk-worm. They are fixed to the bottom of the open pod, and contain &s;eeds for the fol|lowing year.</P>
<P>With the milky juice di&s;tilled from inci&s;ions in the &s;tem of the <HI>Kon-chu</HI> &s;hrub, they lay on their gold leaf in gilding. It is &s;tronger than our &s;ize; and with the pith of another &s;hrub, called <HI>Tong-t&s;ao,</HI> a kind of cane, re&s;embling our alder-tree, they make their artificial flowers, fruits, and butterflies.</P>
<P>Betel and tobacco is rai&s;ed here, in great abundance. The betel leaf they chew continually, as &s;trengthening the gums, expelling bile, comforting the brain, and a pre&s;ervative again&s;t a&s;thmas. This &s;hrubs grows like ivy, and twines round other trees. They have al&s;o &s;ugar-canes in great quantities, and &s;ome &s;pice-trees. Ginger grows wild, which makes a very plea&s;ant &s;weet-meat, when pre&s;erved green.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="290">But of all their trees and &s;hrubs, that which merits mo&s;t our attention, is the tea-plant, called, by them, <HI>Tcha,</HI> or <HI>Tha.</HI> Of this there are two &s;orts; the <HI>Song-lo,</HI> or what we call Singlo, or green tea; and the <HI>Vou-y-tcha,</HI> or Bohea.</P>
<P>The tea-plant is cultivated in the fields, almo&s;t like vines, and is cropped at a certain height, to prevent it from growing too tall. But we mu&s;t not confound with real tea, every thing which the Chine&s;e call <HI>Tcha.</HI> What is &s;old in the province of Canton, as a delicate tea, is merely a kind of mo&s;s, which grows on the rocks, near the city of Mang-ing-hien. If this com|modity is adulterated, even in China, can we flatter our&s;elves with having pure and genuine tea in Europe? Perhaps we ta&s;te nothing el&s;e, like many of the Chine&s;e, than mo&s;s from the rocks of Mang-ing-hien.</P>
<P>When the tea-leaves have been collected, they are expo&s;ed to the &s;team of boiling water, after which they are put upon plates of copper, and held over the fire, till they become dry and &s;hivelled, &s;uch as we receive them in Europe. Common tea is pre&s;erved in narrow-mouthed, earthen ve&s;&s;els; but that u&s;ed by the wealthy, is enclo&s;ed in porcelain va&s;es, or in leaden and tin ca|ni&s;ters, covered with fine bamboo-mats. The Chine&s;e, and people of Japan, generally keep their tea a year before they u&s;e it; having, as they &s;ay, when new, a narcotic quality. When they drink it, they infu&s;e it
<PB N="278" REF="291">
in hot water, as we do, but drink it without any mix|ture, and even without &s;ugar.</P>
<P>The tea-&s;hrub &s;eems to be a &s;pecies of the myrtle, &s;eldom grows beyond the &s;ize of a ro&s;e-bu&s;h, loves a gravelly &s;oil, and is u&s;ually planted in rows, upon little hills, three or four feet di&s;tance from each other; its leaves are about an inch and a half long, narrow, ta|pering to a point, and indented, like our ro&s;e, or &s;weet-briar leaves, and its flowers are much like tho&s;e of the latter. The &s;hrub is an ever-green, and bears a &s;mall fruit, which contains round, blacki&s;h &s;eeds, about the &s;ize of a large pea, but &s;carce one in a hundred comes to perfection. By the&s;e &s;eeds the plant is propagated, nine or ten being put into a hole together, and the plants thence ari&s;ing, are tran&s;planted into proper ground.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e know nothing of Imperial tea, and &s;e|veral other names which, in Europe, &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h the goodne&s;s and price of this fa&s;hionable commodity. In truth, though there are &s;everal kinds of tea, they are the product of the &s;ame plant; only differing in colour, fragrancy, &amp;c. according to the difference of the &s;oil, choice of leaves, time of gathering, and mode of pre|paration. The <HI>Vou-y,</HI> Bohi, or Bohea, is &s;o called from its black colour: this differs from the <HI>Song-lo,</HI> Singlo, or Green tea, by its being gathered &s;ix or &s;even weeks &s;ooner, when the plant is in full bloom, and the leaves
<PB N="279" REF="292">
full of juice; whereas the other, by being left &s;o much the longer on the tree, lo&s;es a great part of its juice, and contracts a different colour, ta&s;te, and virtue, being more rough to the palate, and more raking to the &s;tomach. The green tea is mo&s;t u&s;ed in China: the bottom leaves of the tree are generally coar&s;er than the upper leaves, and will not fetch &s;o good a price; but the be&s;t of tea, in China, will not &s;ell for more than 9<HI>d.</HI> a-pound Engli&s;h, the wor&s;t, 3<HI>d.</HI> Bohea tea, if good, &s;hould be all of a dark colour, cri&s;p, dry, and with a fine &s;mell; green tea &s;hould have a blui&s;h ca&s;t, none of the leaves browni&s;h, and &s;hould be al&s;o cri&s;p and fragrant.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e have many flowering-trees, unknown to us, one of which I will mention for its curio&s;ity.&mdash; This is the <HI>Out-om-chu,</HI> very much re&s;embling our &s;y|camore. The leaves are between eight or nine inches diameter, growing to a &s;talk a foot long; it is extreme|ly tufted, and laden with clu&s;ters of flowers, &s;o very thick that the &s;un cannot pierce it with its rays. Though the tree is large, the fruit is very &s;mall, and is produced in the following manner. About the month of Augu&s;t, there &s;prings out from the tops of the branches, little bunches of leaves different from the other, being whiter and &s;ofter, though equally as broad. The&s;e are a &s;ub|&s;titute for flowers, and on the borders, or edges of each of the&s;e leaves, grow three or four &s;mall grains, or kernels, the &s;ize of peas, inclo&s;ing a white &s;ub&s;tance,
<PB N="280" REF="293">
of a very plea&s;ant ta&s;te, like that of a ha&s;le-nut, not ripe.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all the fruits common to Europe, they have &s;ome peculiar ones of their own. They have no good kinds of cherries; and, excepting grapes and pome|granates, the fruits they have, in common with us, are much inferior. They have &s;everal kinds of olives, different from ours; and their manner of gathering them is curious and convenient.&mdash;They bore a hole in the trunk of the tree, put &s;ome &s;alt into it, and &s;top it up; and, at the end of a few days, all the fruit drops of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Oranges, lemons and citrons, are very common. They have many &s;pecies, be&s;ides tho&s;e tran&s;planted into Portugal; they have one &s;ort, no larger than a billiard-ball, which is mo&s;t valued, and &s;ent as pre|&s;ents to India; and a fine &s;pecies of melons. Apricots grow wild; and as to vines, they are con&s;idered as bu&s;hes encumbering the ground, and are generally rooted up, to give place to other things, no wine being here made. Great quantities are rai&s;ed in the pro|vince of Pe-tch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">li; but the fruit is dried, to make rai&s;ins of.</P>
<P>The &s;imples and medicinal plants of China, form one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive branches of its na|tural hi&s;tory; but as it is not my intention to give a
<PB N="281" REF="294">
Chine&s;e herbal, I will only mention the rhubarb and the gin&s;eng.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tai-hoang,</HI> or rhubarb, grows in &s;everal pro|vinces of the empire. Its &s;tem is hollow, re&s;embles a &s;mall bamboo, or Chine&s;e cane, and is very brittle; it ri&s;es to the height of three or four feet, and is of a du&s;ky, violet colour; in the month of March, it &s;hoots forth long, thick leaves, very rough to the touch, and the&s;e leaves, ranged four by four, on the &s;ame &s;talk, form a calix. The flowers are yellow, and &s;ometimes violet; and, in June, it produces a &s;mall, black &s;eed, the &s;ize of a grain of millet, which is gathered in Sep|tember. Tho&s;e rhubarb roots are reckoned be&s;t, that are heavie&s;t and mo&s;t variegated with veins. Some druggi&s;ts will di&s;gui&s;e their old, decayed rhubarb, by giving it a yellow tincture; but, by handling it, the cheat is di&s;covered, as the powder they u&s;e for this pur|po&s;e will &s;tick to the fingers. Rhapontic is often mixed with rhubarb, by tho&s;e who &s;end it to Europe; but this impo&s;ition may likewi&s;e be di&s;covered; the true rhu|barb being u&s;ually in roundi&s;h pieces, and its internal grain, or &s;treaks, running tran&s;ver&s;ely, whereas rha|pontic is in longi&s;h pieces, with its &s;treaks running lengthways; be&s;ides, rhapontic, being chewed, leaves a clammine&s;s in the mouth, which rhubarb does not. It is &s;old cheap in China; a pound of the be&s;t co&s;ts only two-pence.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="295">But the mo&s;t e&s;teemed and valuable of all the plants in China, is the gin&s;eng, which the Manchew Tartars call, the Queen of plants. The Chine&s;e phy&s;icians &s;peak of it with a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and enumerate its wonderful properties without end. The root of the gin&s;eng is white and tough, its &s;tem &s;mooth, round, and of a deep, red colour; its height, in proportion to its vigor. From the extremity of the &s;talk, proceed a number of branches, like radii from a center; each branch has five leaves, finely jagged, or indented, of a dark, green colour, above, and a &s;hining, whiti&s;h green, underneath; and, on the upper &s;ide, they are be&s;et with &s;mall, whiti&s;h hairs; from the center of the&s;e branches, ri&s;es a &s;econd &s;tem, without leaves, and bearing a bunch of round berries, of a beautiful, red colour, but not fit to eat. <HI>Jartoux,</HI> who. &s;aw &s;uch a bunch, counted 24 berries, containing a white pulp, and two rough &s;tones, like lentil &s;tones. The pedicles on which the berries grow, ri&s;e from the &s;ame center, and &s;preading, like the radii of a center, make the clu&s;ter of a circular form. This plant dies every year, and its age may be known by the number of &s;tems it has &s;hot forth, of which there are always &s;ome marks left on the root.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e never &s;ow the &s;eed, becau&s;e it never has been known to grow. This probably gave ri&s;e to the Tartar fable; that a bird eats the &s;eed, when put into the earth, or when it drops, but not being able to dige&s;t
<PB N="283" REF="296">
it; voids it with its dung, after it has been purified in its &s;tomach, and that it &s;prings up in the place where it is dropped. It is far more probable, that the germ of this plant is &s;low in opening, and that the hu&s;k which contains it, remains long in the earth before it &s;ends forth any root.</P>
<P>This plant has at all times been the principal riches of Ea&s;tern Tartary, where it grows; being never found, but between the 39th and 47th degrees of northern la|titude, and between the 10th and 20th of ea&s;tern lon|gitude, from the meridian of Peking. All that extent of country is occupied by a long chain of mountains, covered with almo&s;t impenetrable fore&s;ts. It is on the declivity of the&s;e frightful mountains, and in the fo|re&s;ts, in the neighbourhood of fi&s;&s;ures made by floods below rocks, at the roots of trees, and in the middle of herbs of every &s;pecies, that this valuable plant is found. It never grows el&s;ewhere. It delights in the &s;hade, and &s;eems every where de&s;irous of &s;heltering it&s;elf from the &s;un; of cour&s;e, it is naturally an enemy to heat.</P>
<P>No private per&s;on is allowed to gather it. It belongs to the Emperor; and he &s;ends, annually, 10,000 &s;ol|diers into Tartary, to collect it; and this army of her|bali&s;ts, &s;pread them&s;elves over the ground methodically, and do their bu&s;ine&s;s with great arrangement. They &s;uffer many hard&s;hips upon this expedition; carrying
<PB N="284" REF="297">
with them neither tents nor beds, but a quantity of baked millet, as provi&s;ion. The&s;e men &s;leep in the open air, and are thus employed &s;ix months in every year.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e phy&s;icians, &s;ays <HI>Jartoux,</HI> have written whole volumes on the virtues of this root, and introduce it into almo&s;t all the remedies they pre&s;cribe to the Great. Notwith&s;tanding the great quantities of it pro|cured from Tartary, it is always very dear in China; one ounce of this root, even at Peking, co&s;ts &s;even or eight ounces of &s;ilver.</P>
<P><HI>Lafitau,</HI> a Je&s;uit mi&s;&s;ionary, di&s;covered this root in Canada, in the mountains, not far from Montreal. The Indians called it <HI>Garent-oguen,</HI> which &s;ignifies, <HI>legs and thighs of things &s;eparated;</HI> and the Chine&s;e name, <HI>Gin|&s;eng,</HI> implies, <HI>man's thigh,</HI> the root re&s;embling, but badly, the &s;hape of a man, downwards. <HI>Lafitau</HI>'s Ga|rent-oguen an&s;wers <HI>Jartoux</HI>'s de&s;cription of the Gin&s;eng exactly, and leaves it beyond a doubt, but that they are one and the &s;ame plant; which <HI>Lafitau</HI> conceives to be a &s;pecies of Mandragora, or Mandrake, and to be the Mandragora of <HI>Theophra&s;tus,</HI> which was known to the ancients, and lo&s;t &s;ince their time <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such naturali&s;ts as wi&s;h to know more of this root, and the conjectures above concerning it, may peru&s;e the <HI>Abb&egrave; Gro&s;ier's General De&s;cription of China.</HI></NOTE>. None of it
<PB N="285" REF="298">
is found at Quebec; but it is known to every one at Montreal, being &s;old there by the Iroquois Indians at a great price. It is to be met with, in abundance, towards the &s;outh, round Montreal, in the neighbour|hood of Lake Huron, and in the country of the Iro|quoi&s;e, which is &s;imilar to Tartary. <HI>Lafitau</HI> makes the following reflection, on the &s;imilarity of the Chine&s;e and Canadian names&mdash;That the &s;ame &s;ignification could not have been affixed to the Chine&s;e word, and to that of the Iroquoi&s;e, without a communication of ideas; and, con&s;equently, of per&s;ons: of cour&s;e, it confirmed him in the opinion that he had before entertained, and &s;ince corroborated by the la&s;t voyage of Captain <HI>Cooke;</HI> that America and A&s;ia formed only one continent, and that they were originally united, either by Tartary, or to the north of China.</P>
<P>Before I clo&s;e my ob&s;ervations on the drugs of China, I mu&s;t not omit one, the compo&s;ition of which will, doubtle&s;s, appear as &s;ingular, as the numerous pro|perties a&s;cribed to it. It is called <HI>Ngo-kia,</HI> from the city Ngo-hien, in the province of Canton; where there is a natural well, 70 feet deep; and which, as the Chine&s;e &s;ay, has a communication with &s;ome &s;ubter|ranean lake, or other large re&s;ervoir. The water drawn from it, is very clear, and much heavier than common, and, if mixed with muddy water, purifies it, and ren|ders it limpid, by precipitating all its impurities to the
<PB N="286" REF="299">
bottom of the ve&s;&s;el. This water is employed in making the Ngo-kia, a kind of glue, procured from the &s;kin of a black a&s;s. The animal is killed and flayed, and the &s;kin &s;teeped for five days in water drawn from this well. After which, it is &s;craped and cleaned, cut into &s;mall pieces, and boiled, over a &s;low fire, in the &s;ame kind of water, till reduced to a jelly, which is then &s;trained, whil&s;t warm, through a cloth. When this glue is cool, it is formed into &s;quare cakes, on which the Chine&s;e imprint characters, their coats of arms, or the &s;igns of their &s;hops.</P>
<P>This well is the only one of the kind in China. It is always &s;hut, and &s;ealed by the governor of the place, with his own &s;eal, till the cu&s;tomary day of mak|ing the Emperor's glue. The operation continues from the autumnal harve&s;t till March; during which time, merchants treat for the purcha&s;e of the glue, with tho&s;e who guard the well, and with the people who make it.</P>
<P>As this drug is much &s;ought after, and the quantity made at Ngo-hien, not &s;ufficient to &s;upply the whole empire, there are not wanting per&s;ons who counterfeit it, and make a &s;purious kind, from the &s;kins of hor&s;es, mules, camels, and &s;ometimes even from old boots. A number of virtues are a&s;cribed to this drug. They a&s;&s;ure us, that it di&s;&s;olves phlegm, facilitates the play

and ela&s;ticity of the lungs, removes difficulty of breath|ing, comforts the brea&s;t, increa&s;es the blood, &s;tops dy|&s;enteries, promotes urine, and &s;trengthens children in the womb.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of their Agriculture and Animals.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;poken of the national productions of this country, I cannot more opportunely &s;peak of Chine&s;e agriculture: their gardening I will defer, till I treat of their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Several of the Chine&s;e emperors have thought it worthy their royal care, to promote and teach their &s;ubjects hu&s;bandry; particularly the Emperor <HI>Ven,</HI> who held the plough him&s;elf: and his Empre&s;s planted mul|berry-trees, and bred &s;ilk-worms in the palace, to &s;et their &s;ubjects a good example. All the cloaths that the Empre&s;s wore, were of her own making; and a fea&s;t was in&s;tituted, and is continued to this day, when the governors of the &s;everal towns and provinces, a&s;&s;emble the pea&s;ants about the vernal equinox, and march before them in proce&s;&s;ion, with garlands, mu&s;ic and &s;tream|ers, and the in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry carried before them.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="301">On the 15th day of the fir&s;t moon in every year; which corre&s;ponds to the beginning of March, the Tribunal of Ceremonies announces the return of &s;pring to the Emperor, by a memorial, pointing out every thing he is to do on this fe&s;tival. He fir&s;t names 12 of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious per&s;ons in his court to accompany him, and to hold the plough, after he has performed his part of the ceremony. Among the&s;e, are always three princes of the blood, and nine pre&s;idents of &s;u|preme courts. If they are too old, or infirm, for this ta&s;k, proxies are appointed, by the Emperor, to act for them.</P>
<P>This fea&s;t is preceded by the &s;acrifice of a bullock, which the &s;overeign offers to the <HI>Chang-ti,</HI> or Supreme Being, throwing him&s;elf pro&s;trate on the earth, or knock|ing his head nine times again&s;t the ground. He, and his &s;uite, prepare them&s;elves for this duty, by three days fa&s;ting and continence. Others are appointed on the evening before the ceremony, to go and pro&s;trate them&s;elves at the &s;epulchre of his ance&s;tors, and to acquaint them what he is going to do the day fol|lowing.</P>
<P>The &s;acrifice being performed, and plenty being prayed for, in favour of his people, by the Emperor, under the title of Sovereign Pontiff, in an open place without the city; he lays a&s;ide his royal robes, takes the plough in his hand, to which two oxen are yoked,
<PB N="289" REF="302">
magnificently cloathed, and turns up &s;everal furrows. Forty labourers are &s;elected to yoke the&s;e oxen, and prepare the &s;eeds, which the Emperor afterwards &s;ows; namely, wheat, rice, millet, and beans. The&s;e are brought to the &s;pot in &s;umptuous boxes, by per&s;ons of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed rank. Having plowed two or three furrows, the whole length of the field, the Em|peror quits the plough, and the princes do the &s;ame after him; and, after them, the nine pre&s;idents, the &s;ame. This done, the Emperor &s;ows a little of each of the &s;eeds above-mentioned; and is followed, al&s;o, by his &s;uite. Four pieces of cotton-cloth, proper for making dre&s;&s;es, are then di&s;tributed to each of the 40 labourers, as pre&s;ents; and, an equal quantity, to 40 other per&s;ons, more advanced in years, &s;pectators of the ceremony: and the whole concludes, with the mo&s;t active ploughmen pre&s;ent, fini&s;hing what the Em|peror began.</P>
<P>Agriculture is the principal, and almo&s;t the only re|&s;ource of the Chine&s;e; and they con&s;ider it as the fir&s;t and mo&s;t honourable of all profe&s;&s;ions, it being that from which &s;ociety derives the greate&s;t benefit. The hu&s;bandman, in China, enjoys many great privileges, and ranks before the mechanic, or the merchant; and the magi&s;trates, and grandees, are, for the mo&s;t part, the &s;ons of &s;imple hu&s;bandmen, who&s;e merit has rai&s;ed them to the fir&s;t dignities of the empire.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="303">The people are permitted to employ part of every crop in brewing beer, and di&s;tilling &s;pirits; but if the harve&s;t is a bad one, they are prohibited from this, by an order from admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>They have an idea that, as the &s;trength, or power of a &s;tate, ri&s;es from its wealth, and the wealth of a &s;tate ari&s;es in proportion to its population; the be&s;t method of augmenting the number of people, is to extend the cultivation to the utmo&s;t. Philo&s;ophers have rea&s;oned in the &s;ame manner, from the &s;uperintendence of Pro|vidence, and the univer&s;al ob&s;ervation, of Providence keeping up an equilibrium. Turn five or &s;ix couple of rats into a barn, with a &s;carcity of corn, and they will not breed in the &s;ame proportion as they would do, if that barn was better &s;tocked with grain: Providence never &s;ending mouths, where there is no meat. So one man and one woman might have 20 children; but, in land where provi&s;ions are not rai&s;ed in an adequate proportion to &s;uch an increa&s;e in the &s;pecies, men do not multiply as they otherwi&s;e would. In Switzerland, and in China, where they cultivate the hills to their tops, the lands &s;warm with inhabitants. In the former, the country is &s;o full, that they are enabled to lend out their &s;oldiers to other countries; and in China, where there is greater extent of territory, but not more than four times as large as Great-Britain, there are more than 20 times as many inhabitants. The people of England, whether from this way of rea&s;oning or not, are now
<PB N="291" REF="304">
inclo&s;ing their wa&s;tes, cutting canals, and thus extend|ing not only commerce, but cultivation; and there is little doubt, but if they go on in the &s;ame manner, that in another century, the number of inhabitants will be doubled, and the people then living, from an in|crea&s;e of national wealth, will find them&s;elves free from any internal debt.&mdash;This is a prophecy of mine, which I leave to the world; and which I tru&s;t, on the <HI>data</HI> here laid down, will be fulfilled.&mdash;But to return to the agriculture of the Chine&s;e.</P>
<P>The country, as I have ob&s;erved, like others, has its plains and its mountains: but all the plains are culti|vated; neither hedge nor ditch is to be &s;een, and but few trees; &s;o covetous are they of their ground. Pro|vinces in the north, and north-we&s;t, produce bread, corn, barley, millet, tobacco, peas that are always green; black and yellow peas, which they give to hor&s;es in&s;tead of oats, and &s;ome rice. Tho&s;e of the &s;outh produce more rice, becau&s;e the land is low and watry. In provinces where the plains are mingled with mountains, &s;ome of them mu&s;t needs be barren; but the greate&s;t part have good &s;oil, and they cultivate them to the very edge of the precipices.</P>
<P>It is a delightful pro&s;pect to &s;ee, in &s;ome places, plains, to the extent of three or four leagues, &s;urrounded with hills and mountains, cut into terraces from the bottom to the top, each terrace ri&s;ing one above an|other,
<PB N="292" REF="305">
&s;ometimes, to the number of 20 or 30; every one being three or four feet high. The&s;e mountains are not, in general, rocky, as in Europe; the &s;oil being light and porous, and ea&s;ily cut; and &s;o deep in &s;everal provinces, that one may dig three or four feet before the rock appears. Where the mountains are rocky, the Chine&s;e loo&s;en the &s;tones, and make little walls of them, to &s;upport the terraces; then level the good &s;oil, and &s;ow it with grain.</P>
<P>Hu&s;bandmen divide into plots, that which is of the &s;ame level; and that which has greater inequalities, is &s;eparated into &s;tories, in the form of an amphitheatre; and, as the rice will not flouri&s;h without water, they &s;ink re&s;ervoirs, at proper di&s;tances, to catch the rain|water de&s;cending from the mountains; never complain|ing of the pains and labour they take, either in conduct|ing the water according to its natural bent, from the re&s;ervoirs above to tho&s;e below; or from the lower ones to the higher, by hydraulic machines that rai&s;e the water; &s;o that the hu&s;bandmen is almo&s;t certain to reap a harve&s;t proportionable to his indu&s;try and his labour; and the traveller receives a deal of plea&s;ure, in pa&s;&s;ing through the&s;e delightful fields and vallies, wherein the &s;cenes are agreeably diver&s;ified by the different di&s;po|&s;ition of the mountains that &s;urround them; and finds him&s;elf, every hour, plea&s;antly &s;urpri&s;ed by a new land|&s;cape, that perpetually appears in view, in a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of verdant amphitheatres, which open to his eye, one after another, in his journey.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="306">The Chine&s;e have no meadows, national or artificial; and have not the lea&s;t conception of fallowing; never permitting their lands to lie the &s;malle&s;t time idle. They would con&s;ider meadows, as lands in a &s;tate of nature. All their land, &s;uch as an Engli&s;h farmer would lay down in meadow, they &s;ow with grain; affirming, that a crop of wheat, or barley, will yield as much &s;traw for the nouri&s;hment of cattle, as it would have produced hay, be&s;ides the additional grain for the main|tenance of man; but of which, in plentiful &s;ea&s;ons, they &s;pare &s;ome for the animal creation. Such is the &s;y&s;tem, from one end of the empire to the other, con|firmed by the experience of 4,000 years, among&s;t a people the mo&s;t attentive to their intere&s;t, of any nation in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Without meadows, they breed and maintain a great number of hor&s;es, buffaloes, and other animals, nece&s;|&s;ary for labour, for &s;u&s;tenance, and manure. The&s;e are fed, &s;ome with &s;traw, others with roots, beans, and grain of every kind. It is true, they have fewer hor&s;es, and horned cattle, in proportion, than we have; yet they do not find it nece&s;&s;ary to have more.</P>
<P>In their rice countries, the &s;oil is &s;o light, that they plough with a &s;ingle buffalo, or heifer. After plough|ing, they clean the land from weeds, and, if it is to be &s;own with rice, let in the water, and moi&s;ten the earth, till it is quite a pulp, or hotch-potch. The rice is fir&s;t
<PB N="294" REF="307">
&s;owed in little beds, or plots, and, when &s;ix or eight inches high, tran&s;planted into the fields; when the ground is tilled, in rows, as we do our beans. The&s;e plantations they continually &s;upply with water, till the rice ripens; then, the water being dried up, it is cut and thre&s;hed, often in the field where it grows. Rice has an ear the mo&s;t like bearded barley of any European grain, and grows u&s;ually four feet, &s;ome|times &s;ix feet high.</P>
<P>In order to make rice grow the better, in places where they &s;ow it, they bury balls of hog's hair, or any other hair, even human hair; and tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to &s;have the men, are very careful in &s;aving the hair they &s;have off; for they &s;ell it to the farmers of the&s;e low countries, at a halfpenny, Engli&s;h, per pound. It is conveyed in bags, and barks are often loaded with this, and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>For wheat and barley, they grub up the gra&s;s and roots, and having burnt all together with &s;traw, and &s;ifted the earth fine, they &s;ow it with &s;eed, in drills, as &s;ome of our farmers do. Rice-land requires no dre&s;&s;ing. Water is &s;ufficient: and, for other grain, they u&s;e a&s;hes, and all &s;orts of dung, even human dung.</P>
<P>The mountains, and va&s;t fore&s;ts of China, abound with wild animals of every &s;pecies, &s;uch as the rhino|ceros, elephants, &s;erpents, tygers, bears, wolves, foxes,
<PB N="295" REF="308">
buffaloes, camels, hor&s;es, wild mules, &amp;c. but no lions; &s;ome beavers, &s;ables, and ermines, are met with in the northern provinces, but much inferior to tho&s;e caught in Siberia.</P>
<P>A kind of tyger is &s;een in China, which has a body like a dog, but no tail; he is remarkably &s;wift and fero|cious. If any one meets this animal, and to e&s;cape from his fury, climbs up a tree, he immediately &s;ends forth a loud yell, and &s;everal others join him, who, all together, dig up the earth round the roots of &s;uch tree, and over|turn it. But the Chine&s;e have lately found out a me|thod of de&s;troying them: a certain number of people a&s;&s;emble towards evening, and rai&s;e a circle of &s;trong pales, in which they &s;hut them&s;elves up; then, imi|tating the yell of the animal, they draw all tho&s;e in the neighbourhood round them, and, whil&s;t the&s;e fero|cious bea&s;ts are digging up the earth, to overturn the palli&s;ade, the men within di&s;patch them with their bows and arrows.</P>
<P>Camels are found in the north-ea&s;t part of China, both wild and dome&s;tic. They have a &s;pecies of camel, no larger than a hor&s;e, with two bunches on his back, having a head like a &s;heep, a long neck, and hanging ears; he chews the cud, endures cold without pain, &s;heds his hair, and becomes quite naked in &s;ummer: he can bear a burthen of 3,000 Chine&s;e pounds in weight, and can travel 50 Engli&s;h miles a-day. By
<PB N="296" REF="309">
natural in&s;tinct, he fore&s;ees an approaching &s;torm, and di&s;covers &s;prings in the earth. By digging where a camel beats with his foot, one is certain of finding water below; and, when camels flock together with loud cries, and bury their no&s;es in the &s;and, it is a &s;ure &s;ign the wind is about to blow; of cour&s;e, they &s;eem or|dained for travelling the &s;andy de&s;arts. There are others that, from their &s;wiftne&s;s, can travel 200 miles a-day.</P>
<P>China abounds in &s;everal &s;pecies of apes, &s;ome equal in height to a common-&s;ized man; they walk on their hind legs, and all their actions have a &s;imilar confor|mity to ours.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t beautiful quadruped they have, is a &s;tag, about the &s;ize of a common dog, which are bought at a very great price, and kept as curio&s;ities. They have, al&s;o, &s;tags of an enormous &s;ize, called hor&s;e-&s;tags. But their mu&s;k-deer is, of all animals, that which they mo&s;t pride them&s;elves in, being met with no where el&s;e. It is here very common, has no horns, and its hair almo&s;t black. The bag which con|tains its mu&s;k, is formed of a very thin membrane, co|vered with &s;oft hair. The fle&s;h is &s;erved up at the mo&s;t delicate tables. This animal lives on the fle&s;h of &s;erpents; which, though of an enormous &s;ize, they find no difficulty in killing: for a &s;erpent, at a certain di&s;tance, is immediately overcome by the effluvia of its
<PB N="297" REF="310">
mu&s;k, and rendered &s;en&s;ele&s;s and immoveable. The pea&s;ants, convinced of this, when they go into the mountains for coals or wood, take a little of this mu&s;k with them, as the be&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t &s;erpents; for, &s;hould they lie down to &s;leep, no &s;erpent can approach them.</P>
<P>In the fore&s;ts of Chine&s;e Tartary, there are flying foxes, and flying rats, &s;imilar to the flying &s;quirrels I have de&s;cribed in Tartary. But a much more extra|ordinary rat, called the <HI>Fen-chou,</HI> is found upon the coa&s;ts of the northern &s;ea, which is almo&s;t always fro|zen. This animal is formed like a rat, but as large as an elephant. It dwells in ob&s;cure caverns, and care|fully &s;huns the light. The ivory it produces, is as white as that of the elephant. Another kind, of a le&s;s &s;ize, but as large as a buffalo, burrows in the earth like a mole, flies from the light, and remains almo&s;t always &s;hut up in &s;ubterranean retreats.&mdash;The account I have given of the&s;e rats, is extracted from a printed col|lection of Ob&s;ervations, written by the celebrated Em|peror <HI>Kang-hi.</HI></P>
<P>Chine&s;e hor&s;es have neither the &s;trength, the beau|ty, nor the &s;wiftne&s;s of ours; and the inhabitants have not the art of breaking them in properly. They ca&s;|trate them, to make them gentle; but they are &s;o timid, that they will fly at the neighing of a Tartar hor&s;e;
<PB N="298" REF="311">
be&s;ides, as they are not &s;hod, their hoofs are &s;oon gone, and they are u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Game is &s;o common, that the &s;quares, or markets, of Peking, in winter-time, are &s;upplied with different heaps of wild fowl, and animals of the chace, frozen &s;tiff, and thus perfectly &s;ecure again&s;t all putrefaction. Prodigious quantities of deer, elks, &s;tags, wild boars, goats, foxes, rabbits, cats, &s;quirrels, and wild rats; gee&s;e, ducks, partridges, phea&s;ants, and quails, are &s;een there, with &s;everal other kinds of game, not to be met with in Europe.</P>
<P>China has birds of every kind, and every &s;pecies, and parrots inferior to none, either in the variety, or beauty of their plumage, or in the facility of learning to talk. But the mo&s;t beautiful bird of China, is the phea&s;ant, many of which have been brought to Eng|land. It is called the <HI>Kin-ki,</HI> or golden fowl. Its body is proportioned with wonderful elegance, and the bril|liancy of its plumage, &s;eems to be the utmo&s;t effort of the pencil of Nature. The &s;hades of its wings and tail, are a mixture of bright red and yellow, and a beautiful plume waves over its head. Its fle&s;h is more delicate than that of our phea&s;ants.</P>
<P>Their manner of catching water-fowl in China, as well as in India, is very curious. When the fowler &s;pies his game, he wades into the water, as high as his
<PB N="299" REF="312">
chin, covering his head with a pot full of holes, to give him air and &s;ight. This pot is covered over with fea|thers, to deceive the game; &s;o that, when he draws near them, by either &s;wimming or walking, they are not in the lea&s;t frightened. The fowler then lays hold of them by the feet, draws them down under water, and the re&s;t of the fowls thinking their companions have only dived, are not in the lea&s;t di&s;turbed, but keep &s;wimming about the place, till mo&s;t of them are taken in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>The butterflies found in the province of Canton, are &s;o much prized as to be &s;ent to court. They are larger than any European ones, and their wings much broader. They begin to flutter about in the evening, like bats; and &s;eem nearly as large, in the extent of their wings. Their colours are wonderfully variegated, and have an extraordinary brilliancy.</P>
<P>As to in&s;ects; they have, at times, &s;uch &s;warms of locu&s;ts, as to become a plague, and de&s;troy the fruits of the earth. One &s;ees, &s;ays a Chine&s;e author, &s;uch prodigious multitudes of them, that they darken the &s;ky, and are &s;o clo&s;e, that their wings &s;eem to touch each other. Their numbers are &s;o great, that, on lift|ing up your eyes, you would imagine you &s;aw, over your head, high, green mountains; and the noi&s;e they make, in flying, is like the beating of a drum.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="313">The &s;ame author ob&s;erves, that this incredible quan|tity of locu&s;ts never appears, but when great floods are followed by a very dry year; it being his opinion, that the &s;pawn of fi&s;h left on the ground, and afterwards hatched by the heat of the &s;un, produces this va&s;t mul|titude of in&s;ects, which, in a &s;hort time, de&s;troys the hopes of a plentiful crop.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to fi&s;h, they have the greater part of &s;uch as have been &s;een in Europe. But they have one, which they call <HI>Tcho-kio-yu,</HI> or the fi&s;h in armour; be|cau&s;e, its body is defended by &s;harp &s;cales, ranged in &s;traight lines, and laid one over the other, like tiles on a roof. Its fle&s;h is white, and ta&s;tes like veal; and it generally weighs 40 pounds. The gold and &s;ilver fi&s;h we have in England, are originally from China.</P>
<P>The mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;peak of another fi&s;h, the figure of which is as &s;ingular, as it is frightful and di&s;gu&s;ting. It is called <HI>Hai &s;eng,</HI> and generally makes a di&s;h at every entertainment. It is u&s;ually &s;een floating, and looks like a &s;hapele&s;s lump of inanimate matter; it has neither mouth nor bones, and dies on being pre&s;&s;ed: but the mo&s;t &s;ingular of all Chine&s;e fi&s;hes, is the <HI>Pimou-yu.</HI> This appears to be but half a fi&s;h, being flat, like the &s;ole of a &s;hoe, having but one eye, and one of its &s;ides without any &s;cales, or fins. This fi&s;h cannot &s;wim, but when it unites it&s;elf to a companion; and the two fi&s;hes, joined, appear to be but one.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="314">They have, al&s;o, a &s;alt-water fi&s;h, with a round head, and its mouth like the beak of a falcon. It has eight legs round its head, but has neither &s;cales, tail, nor bone. <HI>Monkden,</HI> in his <HI>Geography,</HI> &s;ays, it has two tufts of a beard, which re&s;emble two bunches of cord; and that, during a &s;torm, or when the waves of the &s;ea are too much agitated, it extends this beard, u&s;ing it as cords to attach it&s;elf to the bottom of the &s;ea, or to the rocks. The name <HI>Niomer&eacute;,</HI> which the Mantchew Tartars give it, implies, <HI>a moored bark.</HI></P>
<P>Great numbers of whales are met with here, every year, towards the north-ea&s;t, on the coa&s;ts of Korea; and, in many of their bodies, are found darts and har|poons, of the French and Dutch, from whom they have e&s;caped in the northern extremities of Europe; which &s;eems to indicate the exi&s;tence of a pa&s;&s;age from thence into tho&s;e &s;eas, to the north of America.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e, fertile in contrivance, have two me|thods of fi&s;hing, which are curious. The one is prac|ti&s;ed in the night, by moon-&s;hine. They take two long, &s;traight boats, and nail a board, about two feet broad, painted white, and varni&s;hed on the &s;ides, from one end of each boat to the other: this plank &s;lopes outwards, and almo&s;t touches the &s;urface of the water. In order to catch fi&s;h, they turn the face of this plank towards the moon, that its reflection may add to the brightne&s;s of the board; when the fi&s;h playing, and mi&s;taking the
<PB N="302" REF="315">
colour of the board for that of the water, leap up to it, and often fall upon it, or into the boat; &s;o that fi&s;hermen almo&s;t, without pains, fill a &s;mall bark with fi&s;h, in a very little time.</P>
<P>The other method is more &s;urpri&s;ing. As Europeans, and others, train up hawks to fly at game, and catch birds, the Chine&s;e train up cormorants to catch fi&s;h. One fi&s;herman can ea&s;ily look after a hundred of the&s;e birds. He keeps them perched on the &s;ides of his boat, waiting patiently for orders, till they reach the place where he means to fi&s;h; and then, at the fir&s;t &s;ignal, each takes its flight, and flies the way a&s;&s;igned it. It is plea&s;ant to &s;ee them divide among them, the whole breadth of the river, or the lake. They &s;eek up and down, &s;wim, dive, come up again, and hover over the water, till they perceive their prey; when they in|&s;tantly dart upon it, &s;eize it with their beak, and bring it to their ma&s;ter. When the fi&s;h is too big, they help one another; one taking it by the tail, and another by the head, and &s;o carry it to the boat, where the men hold out long oars, or &s;trong canes, for them to perch on; nor will they quit the fi&s;h, till they are &s;ent in &s;earch of others, which they will repeat 100 times. When they are weary, the fi&s;hermen &s;uffer them to re&s;t, but give them nothing to eat till the fi&s;hing is over; during which employ, the throat of each cor|morant is tied with a &s;mall cord, le&s;t they &s;hould
<PB N="303" REF="316">
&s;wallow the &s;mall fi&s;h, and prevent their having any inclination to return. But when the fi&s;hing is over, they untie the cord, and let them fill their bellies.</P>
<P>In the province of Quang-tong, a prodigious num|ber of tame ducks are rai&s;ed, by hatching their eggs in ovens, and dung-hills; but it does not appear that they derived this cu&s;tom from Egypt. They load a great number of &s;mall barks with them, and carry them, in flocks, to feed on the &s;ea-&s;hore, where, at low water, the&s;e birds find &s;hrimps, oy&s;ters, and other kinds of &s;hell-fi&s;h. The&s;e &s;mall fleets generally &s;ail in company, and the ducks &s;oon mix together on the &s;hore; but, when night approaches, they are collected toge|ther, by only beating on a ba&s;on, as &s;warms of bees are collected. At this noi&s;e, they immediately form them&s;elves into different flocks, and each returns to the ve&s;&s;el it belongs to.</P>
<P>Such flocks of ducks are thus rendered u&s;eful on the rice-grounds; and the ma&s;ter of a flock, like the owner of a &s;tock of &s;heep in England, &s;hall be paid for the &s;ervice they do to the land. At certain periods in the growth of rice, it is nece&s;&s;ary to clear the ground of vermin. The ma&s;ter of &s;uch a flock of ducks is ap|plied to, and he will conduct his whole flock into the rice-ground he is employed to clear; where they will, in a few hours, devour all the frogs and in&s;ects as would
<PB N="304" REF="317">
injure the crop; and he then, by a call, or whi&s;tle, takes them back to his boat. Such boats as are em|ployed for this purpo&s;e, are flat-bottomed, and have three or four apartments, above each other; on the uppermo&s;t, the ducks hatch their eggs; on the lower, they &s;it with their brood. The drake, at the call of a whi&s;tle, drives the young ones into the water, and goes before them, to &s;hew them the way. A piece of board is fa&s;tened to the &s;ide, which &s;erves as a bridge for the ducklings to go out and in by; and the old ducks are &s;o well trained, that, on the ma&s;ter of the boat wind|ing a whi&s;tle, the whole flock will follow him. On their return from the grounds, the old ducks divide into two parts; one guards the &s;ide, le&s;t any &s;trange duck &s;hould enter with their own tribe; the other guards the rear, to &s;ee that none is left behind: and, when all are embarked, the old guardians enter, and take their proper po&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the People, Cities, Towns and Gardens, of China.</HEAD>
<P>CHINA abounds in great cities; a traveller no &s;ooner has left one, but he enters another; there are reckoned to be 4402 that are walled in, which are divided into three cla&s;&s;es, as to &s;ize; of the fir&s;t are 160, many of which are three or four leagues in circumference. In the provinces of Xen-&s;i, and Xang-&s;i, their villages are &s;urrounded with walls and ditches, and have iron-gates which are &s;hut every night, and guarded in the day-time by the country people, as well again&s;t the in&s;ults of the &s;oldiers, as the depredations of robbers.</P>
<P>The cities are divided into two cla&s;&s;es, civil and mili|tary: the fir&s;t contains 2045, the re&s;t 2357, and the&s;e are &s;ub-divided into cla&s;&s;es, according to their &s;ize. Sol|diers are quartered in &s;ome of the military ones, and a certain quantity of land a&s;&s;igned them in the neighbour|hood for their &s;upport. The frontiers, and &s;ea-coa&s;ts, are defended by 439 ca&s;tles, well fortified, and kept in order. Along the &s;ame coa&s;ts are 2920 towns, many of which are equal in extent, and population, to &s;everal of the walled cities; and as to the towns and villages, in the interior part of the country, they are almo&s;t innu|merable, and the greater part of them are rich, commer|cial and populous.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="319">The public in&s;titutions corre&s;pond with the extent of the empire. There are 1145 royal lodging-places for the u&s;e of the mandarines, governors of provinces, officers of the court, and couriers that travel at the ex|pence of the crown. The towers, triumphial arches, and other monuments erected in honour of good kings, or illu&s;trious heroes, are in number 1159. The virtues of women being equally here renowned as tho&s;e of men, 208 monuments are to be &s;een con&s;ecrated to the memo|ry of as many females, who by their mode&s;ty, virtue, and attention to the duties of their &s;ex, have merited the e&s;teem and veneration of their fellow-citizens. Two hundred and twenty celebrated libraries are con&s;tantly open to the <HI>literati,</HI> and men of genius; and the &s;chools, or colleges, e&s;tabli&s;hed by <HI>Confucius</HI> and others, founded in honour of him, are multiplied as much as cities and towns.</P>
<P>Every principal city has a palace for the viceroy, go|vernor, or mandarin; a public lodging place, or inn, for tho&s;e who travel on the king's account; and every metropo|lis has a &s;tately, high tower, nine &s;tories high, and another of &s;even, erected chiefly for ornament; being to be &s;een at a great di&s;tance, and from their tops, affording an ex|ten&s;ive pro&s;pect of the adjacent country. <HI>Du Halde</HI> mentions &s;ome of the&s;e, 12 or 13 &s;tories high, every one le&s;&s;ening the over other, with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ymmetry, and all adorned with fine painting, carving, gilding, and al&s;o, with bells round the top of the upper &s;tory, hung by a chain &s;o long, that the lea&s;t wind &s;ets them a tinkling,
<PB N="307" REF="320">
the mu&s;ick of which when it blows hard is uncouth, yet not di&s;agreeable. The&s;e towers are &s;imilar to the por|celain towers at Nanking, a model of which is erected in Kew-gardens near London.</P>
<P>The cities are generally &s;quare, or an oblong &s;quare, with great, high walls, towers, &amp;c. and one or more &s;tately gate at each front; two great &s;treets which cro&s;s one another in the middle of the town, divided in four quarters, and the gates &s;tand due ea&s;t and we&s;t; the other &s;treets run in a direct line, from one to its oppo&s;ite and are inter&s;ected with lanes, running parallel to each other, and adorned with &s;pacious piazzas, temples, and other public buildings. Other cities are perfectly round, others oval, but within, of the &s;ame uniform &s;ymmetry; the far greate&s;t part of them are well &s;upplied with water from rivers, or artificial canals, which run through them, branching into the principal parts of the town, and fur|ni&s;hing fountains, ca&s;cades, &amp;c. in &s;treets, hou&s;es, gar|dens, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The buildings they be&s;tow mo&s;t on, and are whim&s;i|cally extravagant in, are their temples, which they rear to a con&s;iderable height, adorned with every thing curious, and filled with an incredible number of idols, before which hang lamps continually burning: they reckon about 480 of the&s;e temples, of the fir&s;t rank, be&s;ides a prodigious number of others, which are &s;erved in the whole with 350,000 bonzas, or prie&s;ts. Of bridges there
<PB N="308" REF="321">
are a va&s;t; number one of the mo&s;t celebrated, is that over the river <HI>Saffrang,</HI> which joins two mountains toge|ther, and is 400 cubits long, and 500 high, and all of one &s;ingle arch, whence travellers call it the flying bridge There is another at the city of Chang-chew, at the place where the two great rivers of Kiang and Kan meet. This is built upon 130 barges, chained to one another, yet, &s;o as to open a way in any part of it, to let ve&s;&s;els pa&s;s. There are many &s;uch bridges over the country. A third &s;ort is built on pillars without any arch, &s;ome of con&s;iderable length and breadth, particularly that in the province of Fo-kien, which &s;tands on 300 pillars, and is 660 perches long, and one and a half broad, curiou&s;ly built, and adorned with parapets, and great variety of &s;culpture and imagery. Others are built with arches as with us, but of great length, breadth, and beauty: that at Oxu the capital of Fo-kien, con&s;i&s;ts of 100 arches, and above 150 fathoms in length.</P>
<P>Their triumphal arches con&s;i&s;t of three great arches, made of marble, the middle arch higher then the other two, &s;upported by four columns, &s;ometimes round, but oftener &s;quare, of one &s;ingle &s;tone; the frieze is adorned with in&s;criptions, beautiful figures, and &s;culpture, with knots and flowers finely carved, and birds flying as it were from the &s;tone. <HI>Le Comte</HI> con&s;iders the&s;e as their ma&s;ter-pieces in architecture.</P>
<P>Having de&s;cribed the cities in general, I will give my readers a de&s;cription of the three principal ones, Peking,
<PB N="309" REF="322">
Nanking, and Canton, which will enable him to form a good idea of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Peking is the metropolis of the empire, and where the court is held; it is &s;ituated in about the fortieth degree of north latitude in a very fertile plain, 20 leagues from the great wall.</P>
<P><HI>Amiot,</HI> who was at Peking, in 1777, &s;peaks thus of the climate. "From many experiments that I made, I am convinced that the water, air, and earth, for the &s;pace of &s;even, or eight, leagues round, equally abound with nitre. In this year there was a longer continuance of hot wea|ther, then was generally ob&s;erved before. In the months of June and July, <HI>Reaumur</HI>'s thermometer, continually ro&s;e from the 26th, to the 33d degree above Zero; and on the third of July, the thermometer ro&s;e at three in the afternoon, to 34 degrees. Ice, at this time of the year, when fir&s;t taken from the ice-hou&s;e, di&s;&s;olves with diffi|culty, and is tran&s;ported from place to place, during the greate&s;t heats of &s;ummer, in open wheel-barrows, with as little precaution as if it were flints or bricks, and leaves no other traces behind on the &s;and, then a few drops that fall here and there, which convinces me, that the ice be|ing &s;o long in di&s;&s;olving, is owing to its being impregnated with &s;o great a number of nitrous particles; which pre|&s;erves it along time in a &s;tate of congelation. A number of people at this, and other &s;ea&s;ons, are employed by the Emperor to give fre&s;h water, <HI>gratis,</HI> to all who a&s;k for it.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="323">Every kind of water at Peking, whether taken from &s;prings or rivers, has a very &s;ingular quality; it leaves a kind of tartar in tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els in which it has been kept, and in tho&s;e in which it has been boiled. That the air at Peking, is impregnated with nitre, appears from the fol|lowing rea&s;ons. 1. Notwith&s;tanding the variety of unwhole|&s;ome food which the people eat, and all the filth, and in|convenience re&s;ulting from low, damp, and confined lodg|ings, the plague never makes its appearance in the pro|vince of Petcheli, and the people are &s;eldom attacked by any of tho&s;e epidemical di&s;orders, &s;o common in Europe. 2. Provi&s;ions may be kept a long time at Peking without being &s;ubject to putrefaction. Rai&s;ins are eaten there fre&s;h 'till May; apples and pears 'till Mid&s;ummer; wild-boars, &s;tags, deer, roebucks, rabbits, hares, phea&s;ants, ducks, gee&s;e, and all kind of game, brought from Tartary to Peking, in the winter, will keep without &s;alt for two or three months, tho' they are expo&s;ed every day in the markets, and carried about from their hou&s;es to the mar|ket and back, 'till they are &s;old; nay, this may be done 'till the end of March. 3. Whole fields in the neighbour|ing of Peking, may be &s;een covered with a nitrous &s;alt, every morning at &s;un-ri&s;e. 4. The earth is frozen in winter, to the depth of two or three feet, and does not be|come &s;oft before the end of March. This is the rea&s;on, that the fro&s;t will kill plants at Peking, which <HI>Linnaeus</HI> rai&s;ed in Sweden, tho' 20 degrees further to the north.</P>

out of it, they permitted them to build a new one adjoin|ing, which new with the old one, makes an irregular figure con&s;iderable longer then it is broad, &s;o that Peking, is indeed two cities joined in one, as London and We&s;t|min&s;ter is with us. One is called the Tartar city, the other the Chine&s;e city, but the latter is by far the mo&s;t populous. They are both together &s;ix leagues in circum|ference, reckoning 3600 paces to a league. <HI>Le Comte</HI> mea&s;ured them by the Emperor's order, and he thinks them to be four times as big as Paris. But as the hou&s;es in Peking, are but one &s;tory high, and tho&s;e at Paris five, Peking may not have more inhabitants than Paris, e&s;peci|ally if we con&s;ider that the &s;treets are wide, and that the Emperor's palace is of va&s;t extent, containing parks, gardens, canals, &amp;c. yet he &s;eems to be of opinion, that the inhabitants mu&s;t be more numerous, as 20 Chine&s;e will live in as little room as 10 Europeans.</P>
<P>The height, and enormous thickne&s;s of the walls of the old Tartar city, excite admiration; they hide the whole town by their height, and are &s;o thick, that 12 hor&s;emen may readily ride on them abrea&s;t. They have &s;pacious, &s;quare towers rai&s;ed on them, about a bow-&s;hot di&s;tant from each other, and large enough to contain bodies of re&s;erve, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>The city has four gates, lofty and well arched, that at a di&s;tance make a great &s;hew. Over them are large pa|vilion-roofed
<PB N="312" REF="326">
towers, divided into nine &s;tories, each ha|ving &s;everal port holes. The lower &s;tory forms a large hall for the u&s;e of the &s;oldiers, and others who quit guard and tho&s;e appointed to relieve them, and before each gate is a &s;pace of more than 360 feet, large enough for 500 men to be drawn up; a kind of redoubt &s;ur|rounded by a &s;emi-circular wall, equal in thickne&s;s and height, to the city-walls. The arches, or gate-ways, are built of marble, but the re&s;t of the walls of brick. The great road which ends here, is commanded by a pa|vilion-roofed tower, like the gates, &s;o that as the can|non of the former can batter the hou&s;es of the city, tho&s;e of the latter can &s;weep the adjacent country. The Chine&s;e city is, al&s;o, walled round, and has &s;even gates, and a large &s;uburb at every gate.</P>
<P>The &s;treets of Peking, are &s;traight, and a league in length, the principal of them, 120 feet wide, and bor|dered with &s;hops. Tho&s;e in which they &s;ell &s;ilks and china-ware, generally take up the whole &s;treet, and make a very plea&s;ing appearance, and that which renders it more &s;o, is the cu&s;tom trade&s;men have, of fixing up a long board in front of their &s;hops, about 20 feet high, painted and gilt, on which are written the names of the goods they &s;ell. The&s;e being placed on each &s;ide of the &s;treet, almo&s;t at equal di&s;tances, in mo&s;t of the cities in China, and having pendants, and &s;treamers on the top, make a very agreeable &s;hew. They have no &s;igns, but the name of every trade&s;man, is written in large letters over
<PB N="313" REF="327">
his door. Was it not for this, the &s;treets would look mean, notwith&s;tanding their length and breadth, the hou&s;es being &s;o low and mean in front.</P>
<P>All the great &s;treets are drawn by a line from one gate to another, and have &s;everal <HI>corps de garde.</HI> Night and day, the &s;oldiers with their &s;words, by their &s;ides, and whips in their hands, are ready to correct tho&s;e who make any di&s;turbance, and they are authori&s;ed to take into cu&s;tody &s;uch as re&s;i&s;t, or create any quarrels.</P>
<P>The little &s;treets that open into the greater, have lat|tice-gates at the end, which does not prevent &s;eeing all that pa&s;s along, and the&s;e are guarded al&s;o. The lattice-gates are &s;hut at night, and are &s;eldom opened but to per|&s;ons known, who carry a lanthorn in their hand, and who give a good rea&s;on for coming out, &s;uch as fetching a phy&s;ician, &amp;c. In all Chine&s;e cities, there are very large bells; at Peking, there are &s;even, one, according to <HI>Magail|lans,</HI> weighs 120,000 <HI>lb.</HI> is 13&frac12; feet in diameter, and 42 round, and 12&frac12; high, be&s;ides the ear which is three feet more. Tho' they exceed ours in &s;ize, they are inferior in &s;ound, having wooden clappers on the out&s;ide, in form of mallets, that make but a dull noi&s;e. The&s;e bells are almo&s;t in form of a cylinder, near as wide at top as at bottom; but their thickne&s;s le&s;&s;ens gradually from the bottom to the top; the metal is brittle, ill ca&s;t, and full of knots; but its &s;ound which is prodigiou&s;ly loud, and &s;trong, has a mo&s;t awful effect in the night, by its rever|berating
<PB N="314" REF="328">
round the walls, and by the echo of the &s;urround|ing country; one of the&s;e bells is admired for the beau|tiful characters with which it is covered, being as neat, and perfect, as if traced out by the fine&s;t writer, or formed of wax, by a &s;tamp. <HI>Rougement</HI> tells us, that two of the&s;e bells were rai&s;ed to the top of a tower, 130 French feet high by 200 men, only, under the direction of <HI>Verbie&s;t,</HI> a mi&s;&s;ionary, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the Chine&s;e, who imagined it would require &s;everal thou&s;and men, and that two years afterwards he rai&s;ed another, with only 120 young men. By a &s;troke on the&s;e bells the five watches of the night are di&s;tingui&s;hed; on the commencement of the fir&s;t, they give one &s;troke, which is repeated every minute, for two hours, 'till the &s;econd watch; they then give two &s;trokes, repeating them at certain intervals, 'till the third watch, and &s;o on, increa&s;ing the number of &s;trokes, according to the watch. The bells are hung in towers built for that pupo&s;e, and begin to &s;ound at &s;even, or eight in the evening. They make u&s;e of enormous drums for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, 40 feet in circumference.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fir&s;t &s;troke is given by the watch, on the bells, a &s;oldier, or two, comes and goes from one <HI>corps de garde,</HI> to the other, and as they pa&s;s, they play continu|ally on a &s;ort of rattle. They do not &s;uffer any per&s;on to go about at night, and examine even tho&s;e who are &s;ent on the Emperor's bu&s;ine&s;s; if their an&s;wers are equivocal, they take them to the guard-hou&s;e, where the per&s;on commanding mu&s;t an&s;wer every call of the centinel on
<PB N="315" REF="329">
duty. By this beautiful order, which is ob&s;erved with the greate&s;t &s;trictne&s;s, peace, &s;ilence and &s;afety, reigns through|out the city. The governor is obliged to walk round the towers, and often comes when he is lea&s;t expected; and the officers on guard at the walls, and at the gates, where they beat the watches on great drums of bra&s;s, &s;end &s;ubalterns to examine their re&s;pective quarters; the lea&s;t neglect is puni&s;hed the next day, and the officer broken.</P>
<P>This exact di&s;cipline, which prevents all nocturnal a&s;&s;emblies, will no doubt appear very extraordinary with us, and will not plea&s;e our per&s;ons of fa&s;hion; but is it not the duty of the chief per&s;ons of a &s;tate, to prefer good or|der, and public &s;afety, to diver&s;ions and amu&s;ement, which give ri&s;e to a variety of attempts again&s;t the property and lives of the inhabitants? Nothing appears more agreeable to rea&s;on, &s;ince the Tartars, a people without learning, lately come from the mid&s;t of woods, and fore&s;ts, not en|lightened by chri&s;tianity, are governed by the&s;e principles, and by this prudent vigilance cut off the root of the many crimes, which are but too common in &s;tates, not &s;o well regulated.</P>
<P>This regulation is expen&s;ive to the &s;tate, for part of the &s;oldiers are kept entirely to take care of the &s;treets; they are called infantry, and their pay is large; be&s;ides their watching, night and day, it is their duty to &s;ee that every per&s;on cleans before his own hou&s;e, that the &s;treets are &s;wept every day, and watered night and morning in dry
<PB N="316" REF="330">
weather, and the dirt taken away after rain: and as the &s;treets are wide, it is their duty, al&s;o, to keep the middle of the &s;treet clean them&s;elves, for the covenience of pa&s;|&s;engers. As the town is not paved, when the dirt is re|moved, they level it, or dry it, after it has been turned and mixed with other earth; &s;o that two hours after rain, every one may walk clean in all parts.</P>
<P>But if the &s;treets are kept &s;o quiet at night, there is noi&s;e enough in the day; it is a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee the im|men&s;e concour&s;e of people that fill them, and the con|fu&s;ion cau&s;ed by the prodigious number of hor&s;es, mules, a&s;&s;es, camels, carts, waggons, and chairs, which cro&s;s and meet each other, without reckoning the crowds of one or two hundred men, in different parts of the &s;treets, li&s;tening to fortune-tellers, jugglers, ma&s;ters of infinite dexterity, ballad-&s;ingers, and a thou&s;and mountebanks, and buffoons, who read and relate &s;tories to promote laughter, and di&s;tribute medicines, the wonderful effects of which they di&s;play with all the eloquence peculiar to them,&mdash;I &s;ay crowds of men, for not a woman is &s;een in the &s;treets.</P>
<P>As all the riches, and merchandize, of the empire are continually pouring into this city; the number of &s;trangers that re&s;ort here, is immen&s;e. They are carried in chairs, or ride on hor&s;eback, chiefly the latter; but they are al|ways attended by a guide acquainted with the &s;treets, and who knows the hou&s;es of the nobility, and principal peo|ple;
<PB N="317" REF="331">
they are al&s;o, provided with a book containing an account of the different quarters, &s;quares, remarkable places, and re&s;idence of public officers. In &s;ummer-time, temporary &s;hops are built in the &s;treets which add to the confu&s;ion, where per&s;ons are &s;erved with ice-water; and every where we find eating-hou&s;es, and places of refre&s;h|ment for tea, and fruits: hackney hor&s;es, and chairs, are always at hand, for there are no coaches, and for 12, or 15 pence a hor&s;e, or mule, may be hired for the whole day. From the continual croud in the &s;treets, the owner of &s;uch hor&s;e, leads his bea&s;t by the bridle, to make way.</P>
<P>Added to all this, people of di&s;tinction oblige all their dependants to follow them. A mandarin of the fir&s;t rank, is always accompanied in his walks by his whole tribunal, and to augment his equipages, each of the inferior man|darins in his &s;uite, is generally attended by &s;everal do|me&s;tics. The nobility of the court, and princes of the blood, never appear in public without being &s;urrounded by a large body of cavalry, and as their attendance is re|quired at the palace every day, their train alone is &s;uffi|cient to crowd the city, and create confu&s;ion. It is very &s;ingular as I have ob&s;erved, that in all this prodigious concour&s;e no women are ever &s;een; hence we may judge of the population of China, as the number of females here, as well as every where el&s;e, is greater than that of the other &s;ex.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="332">Another addition to the general crowd, is that but few artificers, &s;uch as &s;miths, taylors, carpenters, &amp;c. work but in the hou&s;es of their employers, and of cour&s;e are all day about the &s;treets &s;eeking for employment. Mul|titudes of country people re&s;ort here daily to market, and no river coming up clo&s;e to the city, all manner of goods are brought to Peking, by land-carriage, which fills the &s;treets with waggons, bea&s;ts of burden, and their drivers, in&s;omuch, that, morning and evening, the gates are &s;o thronged, that a man may wait &s;ome hours before he can go by; and yet in all this bu&s;tle, very few accidents hap|pen; the police is &s;o judicious, as to keep all quiet. The city is divided into four quarters and the&s;e four into le&s;&s;er div&s;ions; every ten hou&s;es has an officer like our con&s;table, who pre&s;ides over the other nine, and informs the magi&s;|rate if any thing happens. And, the governor of Peking, has juri&s;diction not only over the &s;oldiers, but over all the citizens, and every thing that relates to the civil govern|ment, and the public &s;ecurity. If any robbery is com|mitted in the night, the neighbourhood is obliged to make it good, and in every family the ma&s;ter is account|able for his children, and his &s;ervants. The &s;treets are patrolled at night by the foot-guards, and the hor&s;e go their rounds upon the walls.</P>
<P>An immen&s;e number of barbers are perpetually walk|ing the &s;treets, with a kind of little bell, to give notice of their approach, to &s;uch as want their &s;ervice. They carry on their &s;houlders, a &s;tool, a ba&s;on, a kettle and
<PB N="319" REF="333">
fire, with a towel and comb-ca&s;e, and will, when called, &s;have the head in an in&s;tant, either in the &s;treet, porch, or the middle of a &s;quare. The&s;e men &s;have, &s;et the eye|brows in order, clean the ears with proper in&s;truments, &s;tretch out the arms, rub the &s;houlders, and do all this for the value of three farthings Engli&s;h, which they re|ceive very gratefully, and then ring their bell for other cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there is &s;carce any invention to which the Chine&s;e have not recour&s;e, to find means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, for as there is not a &s;pot in the empire that lies untilled, &s;o there is not a per&s;on, man or woman, tho' never &s;o old, deaf or blind, but what may gain a livelihood. A great many families in Peking, gain a living by &s;elling matches, others have no other bu&s;ine&s;s, but picking up, in the &s;treets, little rags of &s;ilk, woollen, cotton or linen, and the feathers of fowls, bones of dogs, and bits of paper, which they wa&s;h and &s;ell again.</P>
<P>Strict watch is kept in the day-time here, and in every city, to ob&s;erve tho&s;e who enter; for this purpo&s;e, a &s;trong guard is placed at every gate. The air, the looks, &amp;c. of all pa&s;&s;engers are carefully examined, and if their appearance is doubtful, they are carried before a mandarin. This is to prevent the entry of foreigners among&s;t them, for being bigotted to their ancient u&s;ages; they &s;uppo&s;e that by the admi&s;&s;ion of foreigners, an alteration of man|ners, cu&s;toms, and ceremonies, might in proce&s;s of time,
<PB N="320" REF="334">
re&s;ult from &s;uch an intercour&s;e, and give birth to quar|rels, party-di&s;putes, and &s;edition, and at la&s;t, end in an overthrow of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>None but military people are permitted to wear arms&punc; in public, and the&s;e only, in time of war, guard, or review, of cour&s;e little mi&s;chief is done, by occa&s;ional quarrels. If two men quarrelling, have &s;ticks in their hands, they will lay them a&s;ide, and fight the matter out with their fi&s;ts; but they oftener go before a mandarin and beg him to &s;ettle it. He hears the ca&s;e with great gravity, and according to the merits of it, orders the aggre&s;&s;or, or both of them, to receive a &s;ound ba&s;tinadoing. Pro&s;titutes are not &s;uffered to remain within the walls of any city; but they may re&s;ide in the &s;uburbs, provided they do not keep a hou&s;e of their own. Certain per&s;ons are au|thori&s;ed to lodge them, but tho&s;e per&s;ons mu&s;t watch their conduct, and is re&s;pon&s;ible and puni&s;hable for any noi&s;e or quarrel in his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Every city of China, and &s;ometimes, even an ordinary town, enjoys the advantages of an e&s;tabli&s;hment lately introduced into Paris. This is an office called <HI>Tong-pou,</HI> where money may be borrowed upon pledges. No pre|liminaries are nece&s;&s;ary, the tran&s;action is an inviolable &s;ecret, and the borrower may remain unknown. Tho&s;e who belong to the office, take only a de&s;cription of the borrower, or his per&s;on, &s;o as to be able to give an ac|count of what they do to the Police. If he borrows a
<PB N="321" REF="335">
&s;um &s;eemingly too large for his &s;ituation in life, the&s;e office-keepers will &s;et a per&s;on to follow him home. But, unle&s;s connivance is proved, the office never &s;u&s;tains a lo&s;s. The u&s;ual intere&s;t of money is 30 <HI>per cent.;</HI> and, at this rate, money may be borrowed of the Tong-pou.</P>
<P>However indu&s;trious and temperate the&s;e people are, the prodigious number of inhabitants in populous cities, occa&s;ions a great deal of mi&s;ery. Some of the cities are &s;o poor, that they cannot &s;upply their inhabitants with the common nece&s;&s;aries of life; for which rea&s;on, they expo&s;e their children often in the &s;treets, e&s;pecially when mothers fall &s;ick, or want milk to &s;uckle them. Thus are the&s;e little innocents, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, condemned to death, as &s;oon as they begin to live. This is common in great cities, &s;uch as Canton and Peking; but, in other places, &s;uch in&s;tances are few; and government &s;o far winks at it, as to employ as much vigilance in carrying them away in the morning, as it be&s;tows on their educa|tion, which encourages the practice. This has inclined the mi&s;&s;ionaries, in populous places, to educate &s;everal catechi&s;ts, who divide the whole city, and walk out every morning to bapti&s;e a multitude of dying children; and have prevailed on many of the infidel-midwives to permit chri&s;tian women to follow them to the hou&s;es they are called to; for it &s;ometimes happens, that a Chine&s;e, not being in a condition to bring up a large family, &s;hall engage the midwife, to &s;tifle a female infant in a ba&s;on of water,
<PB N="322" REF="336">
as &s;oon as born; on which occa&s;ions, the&s;e chri&s;tian midwives take care to baptize them fir&s;t. Poor families will al&s;o, when their infants die, lay them in the roads and &s;treets, or throw them in the river, to &s;ave the expence of burying them. It is the &s;ame mi&s;ery that produces a va&s;t number of &s;laves, or rather per&s;ons who &s;ell them&s;elves to their employers. A man will &s;ometimes &s;ell his &s;on, and &s;ometimes him&s;elf and wife, at a very moderate price; but, if he can, he is contented to &s;ell his chil|dren only.</P>
<P>The Emperor's palace &s;tands in the middle of the Tar|tar city, is an oblong &s;quare, two miles in length, and one in breadth, and an a&s;&s;emblage of va&s;t buildings, ex|ten&s;ive courts, and magnificent gardens, &s;hup up, on all &s;ides, by a double wall: the &s;pace between the two walls, occupied by hou&s;es belonging to the officers of the court, eunuchs, and different tribunals, &s;ome of whom have the care of providing nece&s;&s;aries for the Emperor's u&s;e, and &s;ome for determining di&s;putes, and puni&s;hing faults committed by the dome&s;tics of the palace.</P>
<P>Within the inner wall are nine, va&s;t courts, and the arched ways through which one enters them, are erected with marble, and have each a large, &s;quare, Gothic build|ing over them. The offices on each &s;ide the courts are but mean. The Emperor's apartment, which is at the end of the furthe&s;t court, is built on a &s;quare platform rai&s;ed with earth, and ca&s;ed with marble, and con&s;i&s;ts, like all other

Chine&s;e hou&s;es, of one &s;tory, the roof of which is &s;upport|ed by large, marble columns, and covered with glazed, yellow tiles, that glitter in the &s;un, like gold. The white marble &s;teps, by which the&s;e &s;tate-rooms are a&s;cended, the carved-work, varni&s;h, painting, and gilding, with which they are adorned, give them a very magnificent ap|pearance, and &s;uitable to the grandeur of that monarch to whom they belong; but &s;till as <HI>Le Comte</HI> ob&s;erves, there is not that contrivance and uniformity, in which the beauty of our buildings con&s;i&s;ts, and of cour&s;e, the irregularity of the whole mu&s;t offend the eye of any one &s;killed in archi|tecture.</P>
<P>The inner palace-court, at the end of which this plat|form is rai&s;ed, is, 350 feet in length, and 50 broad; an immen&s;e gallery runs round it, in which are magazines, containing rich effects, the Emperor's private property; for the public trea&s;ury is entru&s;ted to a &s;overeign tribunal. One of the&s;e magazines is filled with plate; another, with rich furs; a third, with dre&s;&s;es lined with valuable furs, which the Emperor &s;ometimes gives, in pre&s;ents to his of|ficers. A fourth, is a depo&s;itory of jewels, pieces of curious marble, and pearls, fi&s;hed up in Tartary; a fifth is full of wardrobes, and trunks of &s;ilk &s;tuffs u&s;ed by the Emperor, and his family, and the re&s;t are filled with bows and ar|rows, and other armour, taken from the enemy, or pre|&s;ented by princes.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="338">The platform, on which the Emperor's apartments are built is 15 feet high, with a balu&s;trade <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound it of white marble, and the apartments, being in the center, leave a broad terrace paved with marble round them.</P>
<P>The hall of audience is in the middle front of the&s;e apart|ments, 130 feet &s;quare, the cieling is carved-work, japan|ned green, and charged with gilded dragons, the pillars within that &s;upport the roof, are &s;even feet in circumfe|rence at bottom, encru&s;ted with a kind of pa&s;te, and japan|ned with red; the pavement-floor is covered with an ordi|nary carpet imitating the Turkey, and the walls are whited, but de&s;titute of ornament.</P>
<P>The throne &s;tands in the middle of this hall, and con&s;i&s;ts of a lofty alcove, very neat, but not magnificent, with the word <HI>Ching</HI> painted over it, which implies <HI>Holy,</HI> in Latin, <HI>Eximius,</HI> or in Engli&s;h, "wi&s;e&s;t, or mo&s;t perfect," On the terrace before the hall, are placed great and ma&s;&s;y ve&s;&s;els of bra&s;s, in which perfumes are burnt during the time of audience, and candle&s;ticks made in the &s;hape of birds, large enough to hold wax flambeaus, which at this time are lighted. The private apartments I can give no account of, &s;trangers not being permitted to &s;ee them, nor any of the natives, but women, and eunuchs: in the gardens of the palace are two great &s;heets of water, with a marble bridge thrown over them.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="339">The palaces of the royal family are very neat within, extremely capacious, and built at great expence, but in a &s;imilar form with the Emperor's; a row of courts, adorned with buildings on the &s;ides, and in front, at the end of the inner court, a hall japanned, and rai&s;ed on a platform, three or four feet high, railed round, ca&s;ed with great blocks of hewn &s;tone, and paved with large, &s;quare tiles. The tribunals of the &s;overeign juridictions, are al&s;o, of va&s;t extent, but ill built and wor&s;e repaired, and no ways adequate to the greatne&s;s of the empire.</P>
<P>The &s;eraglio in the court of Peking, contains a col|lection of the mo&s;t beautiful virgins in the empire. The&s;e the vice-roys, and governors of the &s;everal provinces, make the Emperor pre&s;ents of, who indeed u&s;es them no better than &s;laves, for they are &s;o numerous, that many of them are &s;carcely known to him.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of Peking, and even the palaces of the principal mandarins, are built on the &s;urface of the ground, &s;upported with wooden pillars, without any foun|dation. They are but one &s;tory high (except in mer|chants hou&s;es, where they have a &s;econd, as a warehou&s;e), and, of cour&s;e, take up a great extent of ground, having &s;everal, open courts within their walls. The people have &s;uch a regard to privacy, that no windows are made towards the &s;treet, or to look towards their neighbours; and ju&s;t within their great gate, or portal, &s;tands a wall, or &s;creen, to prevent &s;trangers looking in, when the gate is
<PB N="326" REF="340">
opened. When you have pa&s;&s;ed this &s;creen, there are little allies, right and left, by which you pa&s;s into the &s;e|veral courts, with buildings round them.</P>
<P>Their rooms are very plain, nothing being &s;tudied but u&s;efulne&s;s. Tho&s;e that are opulent, add ornaments of Japan-work, &s;culpture, and gilding. The greate&s;t part of the hou&s;es in cities are covered with tiles; all the roofs of the rooms are &s;upported by pillars, 10 feet high, on &s;tone ba&s;es, and beams from one to another; and, the magni|ficence of them, con&s;i&s;ts in the thickne&s;s of the beams and pillars, the excellency of the timber, and the carving on the gates. They have no other &s;tairs than what are before the door, which are a few &s;teps from the ground; but, along the &s;ide of the hou&s;e, is a clo&s;e gallery, &s;ix or &s;even feet wide, and ca&s;ed with beautiful free-&s;tone.</P>
<P>Common hou&s;es are built with unburnt brick. In &s;ome places, they are made with tempered earth; and, in others, the walls are made with hurdles, covered with lime and earth: but tho&s;e of the gentry, are made of poli&s;hed bricks, very curiou&s;ly carved. In country-towns, the hou&s;es are chiefly of earth, very low, and the roofs almo&s;t flat, compo&s;ed of reeds covered with earth.</P>
<P>Their entertainments are made in a &s;ort of hall, or ban|queting-hou&s;e, at the entrance of their hou&s;es, and have no other ornament, than a &s;ingle order of columns, painted and varni&s;hed, to &s;upport the roof; and the roofs are often
<PB N="327" REF="341">
open to the tiles, without a cieling. Round this hall are &s;everal places, partitioned off, with a table and benches, to hold four per&s;ons in each, like our coffee-hou&s;es in London; for, let the company be ever &s;o numerous, not more than four at any time dine at one table, and often but one per&s;on. The furniture of this hall is merely benches and tables, and &s;ome large lanthorns, made of painted &s;ilk, &s;u&s;pended from the roof. Their rooms have no looking-gla&s;&s;es, hangings, or fine chairs; and their beds, which are one of their principal ornaments, are &s;carce ever &s;een by &s;trangers. Tho&s;e of the rich, in winter, have curtains of double &s;atin; and, in &s;ummer, of white taf|fety, painted with flowers, birds, and trees, the po&s;ts gilt, painted and carved, with worked, &s;atin coverlids. The beds of the common people are made of plain linen, and plain mattra&s;&s;es, &s;tuffed with cotton; and, in the northern pro|vinces, the poor &s;leep on benches, built up with bricks, and kept warm by &s;toves on the out&s;ide, like our hot-walls. On the&s;e they &s;leep, &s;ome on the bare bricks, &s;ome on mattra&s;&s;es; and, in the day-time, here they &s;it and work, and dre&s;s their food, having little or no furniture.</P>
<P>They always &s;leep bare-headed; and, tho' their heads are &s;haven, they have but little covering. Their apart|ments are damp, being on the ground-floor, and generally between court-yard and garden, they are &s;ubject to many di&s;orders, ari&s;ing from ob&s;tructions. A kind of deafne&s;s is &s;o common, that a Chine&s;e, in his 40th or 50th year, is &s;eldom free from it; and perhaps it is in con&s;equence
<PB N="328" REF="342">
of this impediment to &s;ound, that their mu&s;ic plea&s;es them infinitely beyond ours; and they had rather hear a drum, a ring of bells, or the jingling of a few, bra&s;s ba|&s;ons, than any concert of European in&s;truments. With tho&s;e who can afford furniture, it con&s;i&s;ts of tables, cabi|nets, &s;creens, chairs, and abundance of porcelain va&s;es; the whole is covered with that beautiful varni&s;h which we cannot imitate, and prettily ornamented with painted figures. The hall is the only place where vi&s;itors are re|ceived, they being admitted into no other part of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The city of Nanking is the capital of the province of Kiang-Nan, and &s;ituated in latitude 32 N. was former|ly the re&s;idence of the Emperor, and by far the large&s;t and mo&s;t populous city of all China. A French mi&s;&s;ion|ary, lately arrived from that Country, &s;peaks of it as follows. "We arrived at Nanking on the 2d of June, "I was very de&s;irous of &s;eeing that city, which is reckon|ed to be the large&s;t in the world. The &s;uburbs, through which we pa&s;&s;ed, are very long, but not populous. The hou&s;es &s;tand at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, having reeds, pools of water, or plantations of bamboo, be|tween them. We took a view of it from the fifth &s;tory of the porcelain tower, which commands an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect; but it did not appear to us to be above two thirds as large as Paris. We could not reconcile this wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the accounts generally given of its immen&s;e extent; but next morning explained the matter. We had tra|velled
<PB N="329" REF="343">
a full league from Nanking, when we perceived, on a &s;udden, the walls of a city ri&s;ing amid&s;t mountains, and appearing as if cemented to the rocks. The&s;e were the walls of Nanking, which, leaving the city where it now &s;tands, have, as it were, retired thither to inclo&s;e a &s;pace of 15 or 16 leagues, 12 or 13 of which are not inhabited.</P>
<P>Nanking has lo&s;t much of its ancient &s;plendor. It had formerly a magnificent palace, but no remains of it are left. A third part of the city is de&s;erted, but the re&s;t is well inhabited. Some parts of it are extremely populous, and full of bu&s;ine&s;s; the &s;treets are not &s;o broad as tho&s;e of Peking, but are very beautiful, well paved in the middle, with large, marble &s;labs, and, on the &s;ides, with variety of pebble and other &s;tones, curiou&s;ly inlaid and bordered with &s;hops. The breadth and dept of the river, on which the city &s;tands, render its port very commo|dious, being here two leagues wide; but it is now grown into di&s;u&s;e. Here re&s;ides a mandarin, or gover|nor, and the Tartars have a numerous garri&s;on, com|manded by a general of their own nation. The city has &s;till, &s;ome beautiful gates, &s;ome few temples, and that famous, octagon, porcelain tower, of which, I &s;aid, there is an exact model in Kew-gardens; it is 200 feet high, and 80 wide at bottom, is in good condition, and has &s;tood near 400 years. It con&s;i&s;ts of nine, &s;imilar &s;tories, le&s;&s;ening in &s;ize, as the column ri&s;es, &s;o as to form a pyramid. Between each &s;tory is a penthou&s;e all
<PB N="330" REF="344">
round, covered with green, varni&s;hed tiles, growing le&s;s and le&s;s, like the tower it&s;elf; and decrea&s;ing in breadth, as it increa&s;es in heighth. On the top is a cupola, thirty feet higher than the eighth &s;tory, with a large golden ball above; and the whole is ca&s;ed with China-ware, glazed and painted, and &s;o joined, as to &s;eem one piece of China. There is al&s;o a bell in Nanking, 11 feet high, and &s;even in diameter, that weighs 50,000lb.</P>
<P>Of the city and environs of Canton, I &s;hall &s;ay a little more, as being the place to which the Engli&s;h go, and of cour&s;e could receive better information re&s;pecting it.</P>
<P>Canton lies in N. latitude 23 degrees 3 minutes, and of cour&s;e, is very hot, being very nearly under the tropic of Cancer. It is &s;ituated on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the large river Ta, about 50 miles from its mouth, and is &s;aid to be the be&s;t harbour in China: indeed, it is that to which all European nations re&s;ort. On the land-&s;ide it is de|fended by three forts, and two, high walls, about five miles in circuit, with very plea&s;ant walks round it; it has al&s;o two, &s;trong water-ca&s;tles, in the middle of the river Ta. From the tops of &s;ome adjacent hills, on which forts are built, we have a fine pro&s;pect of the country, beautifully &s;cattered with mountains, little hills and val|lies, all green; and the&s;e diver&s;ified with &s;mall towns, villages, high towers, temples, the &s;eats of mandarins, and other, great men, which are delightfully watered with lakes and canals, covered with numberle&s;s boats and

junks, &s;ailing too and fro, through the mo&s;t fertile places of the country.</P>
<P>One begins, &s;ays <HI>Premare,</HI> to have an idea of China, on entering the river Canton. Both &s;ides of it pre&s;ent large fields of rice, which re&s;emble green meadows, and extend beyond the reach of &s;ight; they are inter&s;ected by an infinite number of &s;mall canals, in &s;uch manner, that the barks which pa&s;s and repa&s;s in them, &s;eem, at a di&s;tance, to &s;ail along the gra&s;s, the water that carries them being concealed from the eye. Farther in land the country appears covered with trees, and cultivated along the vallies, and the whole &s;cene is inter&s;per&s;ed with villages, rural &s;eats, and &s;uch a variety of delight|ful pro&s;pects, that one is never tired of viewing them, and regrets to be obliged to pa&s;s them &s;o quickly.</P>
<P>From the Engli&s;h factory at Canton, to Wampo, where the &s;hips lie, it is about &s;ix miles by water, on the river Ta; and in the way there, the eye is delighted, not only with green and fruitful fields, and boats pa&s;&s;ing and re-pa&s;&s;ing; but with a number of villages and lofty pagodas and &s;teeples. One of the&s;e pagodas is &s;ituated clo&s;e to the river, and is called the half-way-hou&s;e. <HI>(See the plate of Wampo.)</HI></P>
<P>The city is entered by &s;even, iron gates, within each of which is a guard-hou&s;e. No European is allowed to enter there, if known. The &s;oldiers that keep guard, are armed with &s;pears, darts, &s;words, and match-lock
<PB N="332" REF="347">
guns; but mo&s;t of them with bows and arrows, which they e&s;teem more than any other military weapon.</P>
<P>Canton is compo&s;ed, as it were, of three different cities, &s;o united that the &s;ame gates &s;erve to go out from one, and enter another. The&s;e three cities form a regular &s;quare; the &s;treets are long and narrow, and paved with broad &s;tone, and ornamented from &s;pace to &s;pace with triumphal arches; &s;ome of them are covered; the&s;e contain the riche&s;t &s;hops. The hou&s;es are like tho&s;e of Peking, &s;ome of which are hung with paper, or pieces of white taffety, on which are written, in Chine&s;e charac|ters, religious and moral &s;entences. They have no chim|nies, but, in their &s;tead, place a &s;hallow, iron pot filled with charcoal, in the middle of the room, in winter, which is &s;uffocating to people unaccu&s;tomed to it. In their kitchens they have a copper, built in brick-work, much about the height of our Engli&s;h &s;toves. The windows are made of cane, or rattan. In winter, they cut oy&s;ter-&s;hells into diamond-&s;hape, and &s;et them in wooden frames, but the&s;e afford only a dull light.</P>
<P>The &s;hops of tho&s;e that deal in &s;ilk, are very neat, make a fine &s;how, and are all in one place; for trade&s;|men, or dealers in any kind of goods, herd together in the &s;ame &s;treet. On this account you may hear the En|gli&s;h &s;ailors talking of the &s;treets of Canton, as if they were &s;peaking of London, or &s;ome other Engli&s;h city. The &s;treet where the China-&s;hops are, they call China-Row;
<PB N="333" REF="348">
that where cloaths are &s;old, Monmouth-Street; and that narrow &s;treet, where men's caps, &s;hoes, &amp;c. are expo&s;ed to &s;ale, Mandarin-cap-alley; and a narrow pa&s;&s;age, clo&s;e to the city-wall, where lapidary and gla&s;s-work is &s;old, is called Stone-cutter's-alley; and &s;o of many others. The &s;hops have counters, drawers, and divi&s;ions, much like our own, and there are few of the merchants, but who have a per&s;on that can &s;peak broken Engli&s;h or Portugue&s;e; &s;o that French, Dutch, and Danes, are obliged to &s;peak either the one or the other, when they traffic with them.</P>
<P>There are a great number of market-places for fi&s;h, fle&s;h, poultry, vegetables, and all kinds of provi&s;ions. Every thing is &s;old cheap. Fi&s;hmongers keep their fi&s;h alive in ci&s;terns. Dogs, cats, frogs, and rats, are here &s;old as provi&s;ions. Indeed, the Chine&s;e have good appetites, for they will eat any &s;ort of meat, that which dies in a ditch, equally as hearty as that killed by a butcher. Dogs and cats are commonly brought to mar|ket alive, in ba&s;kets, are generally young and fat, and kept very clean. Rats, &s;ome of which are of a mon|&s;trous &s;ize, are very fat, and generally hung up with the &s;kins on, by nails on the po&s;ts of the market-place. Frogs, which are the greate&s;t dainty here, are &s;old at a great price. They are black, and loath&s;ome to a Eu|ropean eye, but the Chine&s;e &s;ay, they have a very fine ta&s;te. The rats, they &s;ay, eat well; and &s;nake-broth was in reputation here, long before it was known to
<PB N="334" REF="349">
us. Frogs are &s;trung upon a rod, in the &s;ame manner as we &s;tring fi&s;h in England.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;treets, one is almo&s;t &s;uffocated by the &s;tench of the hou&s;es on each &s;ide, and particularly a &s;treet about a mile above the Engli&s;h factory, where there is nothing but cook-&s;hops. They have large hogs roa&s;ted whole, and numbers of dogs, cats, and rats, upon the &s;pits, and the cooks them&s;elves, with their uten&s;ils, have &s;uch a dirty appearance, that the &s;ight, or &s;mell may almo&s;t &s;atisfy the keene&s;t European appetite. They &s;end about their victuals for &s;ale, by <HI>Cowlies,</HI> or porters.</P>
<P>The common people, &s;ays <HI>Lockyer,</HI> eat four times a day, and are &s;uch gluttons, that, if they are in the mid|dle of their bu&s;ine&s;s, will leave it, and run to their victuals at the u&s;ual hour. Rice is their u&s;ual diet, which they cram into their mouths &s;o greedily, with their chop-&s;ticks (which are a &s;ub&s;titute for fork and &s;poon) that it would probably choak them, if they did not wa&s;h it down every now and then, with a cup of &s;am&s;hue, &s;tanding by them. Some of them will eat &s;ix pint-ba&s;ons of rice at one meal.</P>
<P>People of condition are here carried about in chairs. The &s;treets are continually crowded, e&s;pecially with por|ters, who are all loaded, and have, for the mo&s;t part, their heads, legs, and feet bare. There is no conve|nience in this city for conveying goods from one part to another, but on men's &s;houlders.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="350">In the &s;treets of Canton, we often meet with blind beggars, a di&s;ea&s;e which &s;ome imagine is the con&s;equence of their living &s;o much upon rice; or it may be owing to the hot winds which blow here at certain &s;ea&s;ons; they are, indeed, mi&s;erable objects, and commonly go naked, excepting a trow&s;er, or cloth round their wai&s;t; their &s;kins are as black as Malays, and &s;ometimes &s;o parched, &s;potted, and full of running &s;ores and ulcers, that they truly &s;tink alive. They go &s;ometimes in companies, and are &s;ure to follow and plague Europeans, becau&s;e they get from one foreigner, more, &s;ometimes, than from a dozen of their own countrymen. They hold out a coar&s;e China ba&s;on, and will not leave you until you put &s;ome|thing into it; nay, if you are not upon your guard, they will run again&s;t you, with their dirty hands, and di&s;ea&s;ed bodies. The common &s;ailors give them u&s;ually a bit of tin, in order to &s;ave their money, and avoid coming in contact with the&s;e mo&s;t wretched of creatures. The Chine&s;e them&s;elves are very uncharitable; they never give money to a beggar, but put them off with a &s;mall hand|ful of rice.</P>
<P>There are a great many, private walks about the &s;kirts of the town, where tho&s;e of the better &s;ort have their hou&s;es, and which are little frequented by Europeans, who&s;e bu&s;i|ne&s;s is chiefly in the trading part of the city, where there are only &s;hops and warehou&s;es. Few of the Chine&s;e keep their families in the hou&s;es where they do bu&s;ine&s;s, but,
<PB N="336" REF="351">
either in the city, in the more remote &s;uburbs, or further up the country.</P>
<P>As the women in China are kept &s;o very private, that many have made voyages there, and never &s;een a woman, but of the lowe&s;t rank; it is natural for them to pry into the mo&s;t retired and unfrequented places, where there is a probability of the womens being lea&s;t upon their guard; and in &s;uch rambles, a European's curio&s;ity is &s;el|dom entirely di&s;appointed. Sometimes they pop in on a parcel of young boys and girls, attended by their nur&s;es; but when this happens, they are all &s;o frighted at the &s;ight of a <HI>Fanquy,</HI> as they call foreigners, that they will &s;cream out, and run into their hou&s;es, and by their noi&s;e&punc; alarm the whole &s;treet. Their hou&s;es having no windows to the &s;treet, and having a &s;creen of &s;plit cane before the door, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee them; though they can ea&s;ily &s;ee any per&s;on without, through the lattice-work of the &s;creen.</P>
<P>Now and then, on turning a corner, or on entering a private &s;treet, &s;uddenly, we find our&s;elves in a company of young ladies, conver&s;ing or playing together; but they no &s;ooner &s;ee us, than they &s;et up a &s;cream, and run for &s;helter into their apartments, as if the devil him&s;elf was cha&s;ing them.</P>
<P>"However," &s;ays an Engli&s;hman, who has been of|ten at Canton, <Q>the&s;e accidental interviews made us very
<PB N="337" REF="352">
happy; for we frequently &s;aw &s;ome charming crea|tures, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all de&s;cription, and who&s;e beauty, mo&s;t Europeans, who have been there, are intirely ignorant of. Indeed we could only be happy in the glance of one or two &s;uch, in a &s;treet, for the &s;cream|ing of one caught out of doors, immediately alarmed the re&s;t of the ladies, and baffled our curio&s;ity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sometimes, indeed, we met them at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from their hou&s;es, and, as their feet are &s;o little, that they cannot walk or run, but rather trip, or hobble along, and are often obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t them|&s;elves by laying hold of the wall, as they move along; it gave us an opportunity to gaze on them attentively, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, that they &s;eemed &s;o affrighted, and walked &s;o awkwardly, that I was fain to retire, le&s;t I &s;hould have made them &s;tumble and fall, for which I &s;hould certainly have been bamboo'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The complexion of the ladies is exceeding fair, and their hair of the fine&s;t black, dre&s;&s;ed up with gold and &s;ilver bodkins, and adorned with flowers. Their &s;hape is exqui&s;itely fine, and their dre&s;s the mo&s;t becoming, natural, ea&s;y, and &s;plendid, I ever &s;aw.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Before we left Canton, they were &s;o familiarized to our vi&s;its, that the young boys would frequently come, or were &s;ent, to &s;alute us; but if we offered to ap|proach the hou&s;es, where their mothers, or nur&s;es
<PB N="338" REF="353">
waited their return, they pre&s;ently ran from us, and &s;hut the door.</Q></P>
<P>It is reckoned, that there are, in the city and &s;uburbs, 1,200,000 people, and you will &s;carce find a day in the whole year, but there are 5000 trading ve&s;&s;els lying be|fore the town.</P>
<P>Few days pa&s;s in Canton, but there are proce&s;&s;ions. When a mandarin of note pa&s;&s;es in the &s;treet, or in the highway, he moves in great &s;tate; either on hor&s;eback, or in a large chair, carried by five men: if he is a Tar|tar, or mandarin of war, he is on hor&s;eback; if a Chi|ne&s;e, and of the civil order, he is carried in a chair. Se|veral flags are borne before him, and large lacquered peels, painted black and red, with large, golden charac|ters, expre&s;&s;ing his titles and dignities. Clo&s;e to the mandarin, are carried &s;everal umbrellas, to keep off the heat of the &s;un. In the front are a number of men with high-crowned hats, with two large phea&s;ant-feathers in each, who make a hideous noi&s;e, crying ince&s;&s;antly <HI>Ho-ot!</HI> to warn every one to go off the &s;treets, or &s;tand a&s;ide till the mandarin pa&s;&s;es by. Next to them, are fel|lows with &s;mall chains in their hands, ready to throw over any ones head, and drag them by the neck, that do not obey the call, or &s;tand a&s;ide, to let the mandarin pa&s;s. After the&s;e a number of executioners follow, with en&s;igns of puni&s;hment in their hands; &s;uch as, a &s;word, ax, &amp;c. wearing caps like a &s;ugar-loaf. Several of them have
<PB REF="354">

<PB N="339" REF="355">
large pieces of lacquered wood, painted black, which they drag after them, and with which they bamboo, or ba&s;ti|nado a delinquent. The criminal is thrown on his face, and the bamboo-men give him as many blows on the breech, as his wor&s;hip, the mandarin is plea&s;ed to order.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h factory is &s;ituated in one of the be&s;t &s;treets in the town, where all foreigners re&s;ide. It is very large, has a number of courts, halls, and warehou&s;es; with convenient rooms to lodge a great number of peo|ple. One large gate opens to the &s;treet, and another to the water, where our boats load and unload. At each gate, a centinel is kept day and night. There is al&s;o a petty officer appointed, to &s;ee the centinels duly relieved, and the porters, or <HI>cowlies,</HI> do their duty; to take an ac|count of all goods, that come in or go out of the factory; to prepare rooms for the officers and people, when they come to re&s;ide &s;ome little time in the factory; to enter|tain the officers and men, and, in a word, to &s;ee that every thing is kept in proper order; for all the officers and men are allowed a certain time to re&s;ide, and do bu|&s;ine&s;s, at Canton, according to their &s;tation, which they do by turns: and, in the factory, often &s;ixty per&s;ons are entertained at once.</P>
<P>The temples, and places of public wor&s;hip, are the mo&s;t magnificent buildings at Canton; they are well &s;tocked with images, to which the people pay profound adoration, by falling down on their knees before them, wringing
<PB N="340" REF="356">
their hands and beating their foreheads again&s;t the ground. The&s;e temples, or jo&s;s-hou&s;es, are generally one &s;tory high, and are very numerous; they are decorated with a great number of artificial flowers, embroidered hangings, curtains, and fringes. One of them, &s;ituated in the &s;kirt of the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;uburbs, makes a &s;plen|did appearance: it is four &s;tories high, has a fine cupola, with many out-hou&s;es and galleries. This was formerly a palace belonging to the Wang-tai, or king of the pro|vince of Canton, before the Tartars conquered China, and who was then an independant prince. Before the principal gate of the temple are two large images, one on each &s;ide, about 12 feet high, with &s;pears and lances in their hands, &s;omewhat re&s;embling tho&s;e in Guildhall, London: this gate leads into a fine, large, paved court, and we enter the temple which fronts it, by free-&s;tone &s;teps. The lower part of the temple is built with fine hewn &s;tone, but the upper part is timber. In the lower hall, there are a number of images of all &s;izes, and of diffe|rent dignities, all finely gilt, and kept exceedingly clean, by the prie&s;ts. Le&s;&s;er images are placed in the corners of the hall, and one of a larger &s;ize in the middle. The center god &s;its in a lazy po&s;ture, with his heels drawn up to his breech, almo&s;t naked, particularly his brea&s;t and belly, and leaning on a large cu&s;hion: he is ten times larger than an ordinary man, very corpulent, and of a merry countenance, and gilt all over: models of this, in China-ware, have often been brought to England. Up|&s;tairs
<PB N="341" REF="357">
there are al&s;o many images of men and women, who have been deified for their brave and virtuous actions.</P>
<P>The rooms of this cathedral, or temple, are large and &s;pacious, but very old, and much out of repair. It is &s;urrounded with canals and gardens, but for want of proper care, the water is &s;tagnated, and over-grown with weeds and ruins.</P>
<P>Though Canton is but 24 degrees from the equator, and is &s;corching hot in &s;ummer, yet, about the months of December and January, it is &s;ubject to high winds, and very heavy rains. The &s;udden alteration, the climate and temperature of the air then undergoes, is very &s;ur|pri&s;ing. At this time, the people of China take to their winter-dre&s;s, which is lined with furs, or quilted cotton. In&s;tead of wearing fans, which are u&s;ed by men, women, and children, in hot weather, they keep a live quail in their hands, to keep them warm, and have the long &s;leeves of their gowns down, to cover their hands. Thus equipped, they walk &s;o &s;tiff, and &s;hove up their &s;houl|ders &s;o much, that one would think they were freezing to death.</P>
<P>The &s;treets of Canton, in the time of tho&s;e violent &s;torms, called the <HI>Typhones,</HI> are over-flowed with water, and it is often &s;o deep, that in many places it will float a &s;mall boat. Common people then pa&s;s from &s;treet to &s;treet, by wading through the water, but tho&s;e of the bet|ter
<PB N="342" REF="358">
cla&s;s, are carried in chairs, or on men's backs. Their umbrellas are now u&s;ed to &s;hade them from the &s;un, which ju&s;t before were u&s;ed to keep off the rain.</P>
<P>The river Ta, at Canton, is &s;omewhat broader than the Thames at London; but the crowds of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els that ply the Ta, are va&s;tly more numerous. For the &s;pace of four or five miles oppo&s;ite the city, is an exten|&s;ive, wooden town of large ve&s;&s;els and boats, &s;towed &s;o clo&s;e, as &s;carce to leave room for a boat to pa&s;s. They are generally drawn up in ranks, with a narrow pa&s;&s;age left, for ve&s;&s;els to pa&s;s and re-pa&s;s. Some of them are large ve&s;&s;els, of 8 or 900 tons burthen, called junks in which they perform their foreign voyages. Here are al&s;o an incredible number of &s;mall boats, in which poor families live all their life-time; begetting, and bringing up children without ever putting a foot on &s;hore: in the&s;e they keep hogs, dogs, cats, gee&s;e, and other dome&s;tic animals, both for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and &s;ale. We have nothing &s;imilar to this in Europe; but people in China are &s;o ex|ceedingly numerous, that va&s;t numbers of families are obliged to betake them&s;elves to boats on the river, for want of room, or means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence on the land, where almo&s;t every habitable &s;pot is occupied. The&s;e boats are very conveniently built, with arched covers, and tilts, made of &s;olid wood, or with bamboo, or cajan leaves, &s;o high, that people can walk upright under them. They manage them very nimbly, having a &s;culling oar at the
<PB N="343" REF="359">
&s;tern, with which they pu&s;h them on very fa&s;t, and pa&s;s each other with ea&s;e and &s;afety.</P>
<P>The large &s;ampans, for in-land carriage, are generally &s;teered with &s;culls, for were they to u&s;e oars, there would not be room on the river for half their number. They have all long, bamboo poles, for pu&s;hing up along &s;hore. The&s;e boats are employed in carrying goods and pa&s;&s;en|gers up and down the rivers and canals.</P>
<P>The &s;maller boats are employed in catching fi&s;h with nets; which they barter for cloaths, fle&s;h, rice, and other nece&s;&s;aries. The owners of the&s;e boats, are always at home, as they carry their hou&s;es along with them, but mi&s;erably poor: their children are numerous, and, in &s;ummer, go quite naked. They are much tanned, con|tinually crawling about the boat, and have all of them calaba&s;h &s;hells tied on their backs, to buoy them up, and &s;ave them from drowning, &s;hould they chance to fall over-board, which often happens. Their beds are fixed below the deck on which they live, and which, being made of boards, and jointed, can be occa&s;ionally re|moved. In the hinder part of the boat, is a place where a &s;tove is fixed to dre&s;s their food, and another apart|ment for keeping their live animals, which they have in great numbers, and which, when they want room, they hang in ba&s;kets, on the out&s;ide of the boat.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="360">The&s;e boats come crowding about the European &s;hips, at Wampo, e&s;pecially at dinner-time, begging victuals from the people on board, in return for which, they of|fer to wa&s;h their linen, and do other menial offices.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e boats have &s;mart, young girls on board of them, which induces the &s;ailors to employ them; and it is among the&s;e mi&s;erable wretches, that European &s;ailors, taking advantage of their nece&s;&s;ities, bargain with a father or mother, for the favours of their daughter. But this traffic mu&s;t be carried on very &s;ecretly, le&s;t it &s;hould be ob&s;erved by the petty mandarins, who are ap|pointed to vi&s;it often, and keep order and di&s;cipline in this floating world. The&s;e mandarins are continually going up and down the rivers, &s;earching &s;uch boats as they have any rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect. Should any European be caught in them, with a young woman, he, together with the people of the boat, mu&s;t undergo the cha&s;ti&s;e|ment of the bamboo, or bribe the mandarin with a dol|lar or two, to let them pa&s;s. There are &s;ome of the&s;e boats called <HI>loblob</HI> boats, well &s;tocked with a number of beautiful, young women, of different ages, to whom every body, Chine&s;e or European, may have acce&s;s at any time. Though the&s;e boats are under the juri&s;diction of the mandarins, and equally liable to puni&s;hment, with the others; yet there is &s;o good an under&s;tanding between the mandarins, and the proprietors of the&s;e boats, that they deal pretty exten&s;ively, and with great &s;afety; only, when they di&s;cern a European, who has a large &s;um of
<PB N="345" REF="361">
money about him, they lay their heads together to make the mo&s;t of him. It is &s;aid, the mandarins them&s;elves are no &s;trangers to the&s;e boats, particularly when there are any fre&s;h goods embarked. Pimps are numerous. If a European wants to &s;ee a lady of plea&s;ure, it is only &s;peak|ing to the&s;e fellows, who will immediately conduct you in a &s;mall &s;ampan, to a place where your wi&s;hes may be gratified. The&s;e enterpri&s;es, however, are not always executed without danger.</P>
<P>At the entrance of the bay of Canton, is the celebrated Portugueze port, called Macao, in latitude 22 degrees, 12 minutes. The town is built on the point of a &s;mall i&s;land, which commands a good road, and &s;afe &s;helter for &s;hipping. The Portugue&s;e obtained this port, as a reward for &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance they gave again&s;t a celebrated pirate, who had laid &s;iege to the capital of this large pro|vince; but they &s;ubmit to the Chine&s;e, pay their cu&s;toms to the Emperor, and obey his mandarins. They have, however, a governor of their own, and pay the Emperor annually, a tribute of 100,000 ducats, for the liberty of choo&s;ing their own magi&s;trates, exerci&s;ing their religion, and living according to their own laws. Their hou&s;es are built after the European manner, and the city is de|fended by three forts, well planted with artillery.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that the Portugue&s;e here hold their Sunday on the &s;ame day the Spaniards, on the Philippine I&s;lands, do their Saturday. This difference of days, which
<PB N="346" REF="362">
is general through the week, ari&s;es from the different routes the&s;e nations take, in going to their &s;everal &s;ettle|ments. The Portugue&s;e, in going to Macao, &s;ail ea&s;t|ward; whereas the Spaniards, in going to the Philippine I&s;les, from America, &s;ail to the we&s;t.</P>
<P>Four leagues from Canton, is the famous village of Fo-chan, the large&s;t and mo&s;t populous in the world. It is called a village, not having a governor, nor being en|clo&s;ed with walls; yet it contains more hou&s;es and inhabi|tants, than even Canton it&s;elf. It is reckoned to be three leagues in circumference.</P>
<P>North-ea&s;t of Canton, in the province of Fo-kien, the Port, called Emouy, from the i&s;land that forms it. It is &s;o large, that &s;everal thou&s;and ve&s;&s;els may ride at anchor in it, and the depth of water is &s;o great, that the large&s;t &s;hips may lie clo&s;e to the &s;hore without danger. It u&s;ed to be much frequented by European ve&s;&s;els; but all the trade is now removed to Canton. There is, how|ever, a garri&s;on of 6 or 7000 men, commanded by a Chine&s;e general. Three leagues from it, is a &s;mall i&s;land, with a natural arch in the middle, which can be &s;een through, and it is hence called the <HI>perforated i&s;land.</HI> The i&s;le of Emouy is particularly celebrated for the magnificence of its principal pagoda, con&s;ecrated to the deity Fo.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="363">The mo&s;t ea&s;terly port on the continent of China, is Nimpo. This is a city of the fir&s;t magnitude, very po|pulous, and beautified with many triumphal arches. It is but two days &s;ail from Japan, with which i&s;land, they carry on a great trade.</P>
