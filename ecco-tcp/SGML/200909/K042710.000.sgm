<P>THE dinner-hour of per&s;ons of fa&s;hion having almo&s;t jo&s;tled the &s;upper-hour of our an|ce&s;tors out of its place, the fir&s;t act of a play is either very thinly attended, or con&s;iderably inter|rupted by the clattering of box-doors and &s;eats, while the hou&s;e is filling; for which rea&s;on it has been thought nece&s;&s;ary, of late years, at the Hay-Market Theatre, to perform a &s;hort piece previous to that which is meant as the principal attraction: tho&s;e already upon the acting li&s;t having been &s;ome time in u&s;e, Mr. Colman (then junior) de&s;i|red me to point out &s;uch as might occur, &s;uitable to the purpo&s;e. I mentioned <HI>The Fatal Extrava|gance,</HI> written by Jo&s;eph Mitchell; (<HI>Vide</HI> BIOGRA|PHIA DRAMATICA, 1782, <HI>V. II. P.</HI> 119.) which, on looking over it, he was plea&s;ed to approve of; ex|cepting that he thought the cata&s;trophe too tragick for a petite-piece. I, therefore, made &s;uch altera|tions in it as he conceived to be wanting; in doing which, I availed my&s;elf of his very judicious ad|vice, and adopted &s;everal energetick expre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="4" REF="4">dropt, during the rehear&s;als, from his mouth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pen.</P>
<P>The concluding lines, <Q>"Hence may the Game&s;ter learn, ere yet too late," &amp;c.</Q> are entirely Mr. Colman's.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could particularize every word &s;ugge&s;t|ed by him; for tho' I have not, as Ben. Jon&s;on, to our lo&s;s, too-&s;crupulou&s;ly did (as it is &s;uppo&s;ed) by Shak&s;peare, <HI>"rather cho&s;en to put weaker (and no doubt le&s;&s;e plea&s;ing) of mine own,"</HI> yet would I not <HI>"defraud &s;o happy a Genius of his right, by my lothed u&s;urpation."</HI> See Jon&s;on's Addre&s;s <HI>"To the Readers."</HI> prefixed to the 4to edit. of his <HI>"Sejanus."</HI> 1605.</P>
<P>The piece, as altered and called <HI>The Prodigal,</HI> has been excellently performed twelve times at Mr. Colman's Theatre, with di&s;tingui&s;hed appro|bation; &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;ages, now printed, were omitted in the reprefentation: but, what would have been thought tedious and heavy on the &s;tage, it is hoped will not be found &s;o in the clo&s;et.</P>
