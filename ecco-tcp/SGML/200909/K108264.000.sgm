<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Hear ye now, O hou&s;e of David, is it a &s;mall thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God al&s;o? Therefore the Lord him&s;elf &s;hall give you a &s;ign, Behold, a virgin &s;hall conceive, and bear a &s;on, and &s;hall call his name Immanuel. Butter and honey &s;hall he eat, that he may know to refu&s;e the evil, and choo&s;e the good. For before the child &s;hall know to refu&s;e the evil, and choo&s;e the good, the land that thou abhorre&s;t &s;hall be for&s;aken of both her kings.</Q>

<P>THIS text has in all ages of Chri&s;tianity been e&s;teemed a clear and certain predic|tion of the miraculous birth of Chri&s;t; and therefore the&s;e remarks upon it would have been &s;uperfluous, had not a learned and ingenious gentleman lately attempted to prove a contrary

doctrine <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Critical Di&s;&s;ertation on I&s;aiah vii. 13, 14, 15, 16.</NOTE>; viz. <Q>That the prophet <HI>(in this text)</HI> had no reference to the Me&s;&s;iah <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 44.</NOTE>.</Q> That <Q>the words of I&s;aiah prove only that a young woman &s;hould conceive and bring forth a &s;on, without in|timating any thing miraculous in her conception,</Q> &amp;c. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 21.</NOTE> That <Q>from the mo&s;t careful and impartial examination, the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>(here tran&s;lated a virgin)</HI> doth not appear to &s;ignify &s;trictly a virgin;</Q> but that <Q>it &s;eems to mean a young woman in gene|ral, without &s;pecifying particularly, whether &s;he is a virgin or not <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 23.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>This writer is not &s;ingular in his notions, for the authors of the Critical Review have publicly pro|fe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the &s;ame opinion concerning this prophecy (&s;ee N^o 136, fo. 349.)&mdash; <Q>The mo&s;t obvious and natural explication <HI>(&s;ay they)</HI> is this which Dr. W&mdash;ms <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The author of a Concordance to the Greek Te&s;tament.</NOTE> has adopted,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I do not find that they have objected to a &s;ingle part of the Doctor's work; and therefore this pub|lic declaration certainly makes them parties to the whole: nay, perhaps I may &s;ay with ju&s;tice, that they are more concerned in publi&s;hing the&s;e notions to the world, even than the <HI>anonymous author</HI> him|&s;elf; for in&s;tead of giving a &s;hort extracted ac|count
<PB N="5" REF="6">
of the work as u&s;ual, they &s;eem to have co|pied the whole, almo&s;t at length, &s;carcely omitting a &s;ingle circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Now I mu&s;t acknowledge, in ju&s;tice to Dr. W&mdash;ms, that I think he has &s;et forth his hypo|the&s;is to all the advantage that it is capable of; neverthele&s;s, he does not make it appear that the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> in any other place of the Old Te&s;ta|ment where it occurs, mu&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> &s;ignify a young woman that was <HI>not</HI> a virgin; without which proof the common acceptation of the &s;ign pro|mi&s;ed by I&s;aiah cannot with ju&s;tice be rejected; e&s;pecially as a virgin did afterwards conceive, and bear a &s;on; a miracle which never happened before or &s;ince the birth of Chri&s;t! therefore it was cer|tainly a &s;ign worthy of that great and wonderful event; and, from that time to this, has by all Chri&s;tians (except the author of the Critical Di&s;&s;er|tation and the authors of the Critical Review <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. W&mdash;ms has &s;ince informed me of <HI>one other wri|ter</HI> of the &s;ame opinion concerning this pa&s;&s;age; (viz. the author of <HI>"The A&s;&s;embly's Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith examined,"</HI> printed in 1651.) but at the &s;ame time he acknowledges that this authority was not known, even to him&s;elf, until <HI>"&s;everal months after the Di&s;&s;ertation was publi&s;hed:"</HI> and he declares concerning his own &s;entiments of the pa&s;&s;age, that he apprehended them <HI>"altogether new,"</HI> when he wrote, <Q>for <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> I did not then know that any Chri&s;|tian writer had &s;o explained it.</Q></NOTE>)
<PB N="6" REF="7">
been e&s;teemed the completion of the &s;aid pro|phecy.</P>
<P>Dr. W&mdash;ms ob&s;erves that the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> occurs only &s;even times in all; and therefore, I hope, it will not take up too much of my readers time, if I attempt to examine the context of the&s;e &s;everal places, in order to a&s;certain the true &s;en&s;e of the word.</P>
<P>The text wherein the &s;ignification of this word is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t doubtful, is in Prov. xxx. 19. where Solomon mentions four things that were too hard for him; in which number (according to the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation) he includes <Q>the way of a man with a maid.</Q>
The &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age is very different according to the Syriac ver&s;ion, wherein <GAP DESC="foreign"> is rendered <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>in his youth,</HI> viz. the way of a man <HI>"in his youth,"</HI> and not <HI>"with a maid,"</HI> as in the Engli&s;h ver&s;ion. Like|wi&s;e the Latin vulgate, as well as the old Latin ver&s;ion of St. Jerome, conform in &s;ome degree to the Syriac, though not intirely; for they con&s;true it <HI>in adole&s;centia</HI> (not in adole&s;centia <HI>ejus</HI>) which is &s;ufficiently clear without having recour&s;e to Dr. Kennicott's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his &s;ermon preached before the univer&s;ity of Ox|ford in 1765.&mdash;Note 8, page 46.</NOTE> expedient of &s;uppo&s;ing a corruption in the pre&s;ent Heb. text to enable him to read <Q>in his youth;</Q> as if it had been wrote originally <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">Neverthele&s;s, it appears to me that the common Engli&s;h tran&s;lation of this pa&s;&s;age is to be preferred, and that the word mu&s;t here nece&s;&s;arily &s;ignify a <HI>maid</HI> or <HI>virgin:</HI> for the writer &s;eems to allude to the &s;ecret artifices and allurements u&s;ed by a man in order to &s;educe a virgin; &s;uch <HI>artifices</HI> as are hinted at in Exodus xxii. 16. (&mdash;<Q>And if a man <HI>entice</HI> a <HI>maid,</HI></Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) &amp;c.) therefore a word &s;ignifying merely a young woman, or one that was not e&s;teemed a virgin, would not have been &s;o &s;uit|able to the context of either of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages. The <HI>way</HI> of a harlot was too well-known in former days, (as well as the pre&s;ent) to be e&s;teemed a my&s;tery; and much le&s;s a my&s;tery to Solomon, who had <Q>three&s;core queens, <HI>four&s;core concubines,</HI> and vir|gins without number.</Q> (See Canticles vi. 8.) But it is not at all unnatural to &s;uppo&s;e that this ea&s;tern monarch, with all his wi&s;dom, might &s;ometimes be perplexed with doubts and jealou&s;ies concerning the virtue and private conduct of &s;ome of tho&s;e females (as well virgins as others) with re&s;pect to other men: this, it &s;eems, was by him e&s;teemed as diffi|cult to be traced as the way of a &s;hip in the &s;ea, an eagle in the air, &amp;c. By the &s;in of the adulte|rous woman (to which the preceding &s;imilies allude as being equally uninve&s;tigable <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Such</HI> is the way of an adulterous woman; &s;he eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and &s;aith, I have done no wicked|ne&s;s. Prov. xxx. 20.</NOTE>) Solomon repre|&s;ents
<PB N="8" REF="9">
the great difficulty of detecting the incon&s;tancy of any particular per&s;ons in the two former cla&s;&s;es; I mean his queens and concubines; and he would not find it le&s;s difficult (for &s;ome time at lea&s;t) to trace out the <HI>way</HI> (or behaviour) of private admi|rers towards the third cla&s;s of his women, that were e&s;teemed <HI>virgins</HI> in the eyes of the world.</P>
<P>In confirmation of this I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the &s;trictne&s;s of the law of Mo&s;es rendered the ob|&s;ervance of &s;ecrecy ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to offenders in this way: for, if a man was found guilty of <HI>&s;e|ducing a virgin</HI> (&s;ee Exodus xxii. 16.) he was obli|ged not only to pay a heavy fine to the young wo|man's father, and to take her for his wife, but was likewi&s;e deprived of an indulgence, which, of all others, &s;eemed mo&s;t agreeable to the libidinous di&s;po&s;ition of the Jews at that time; and was al|lowed them by Mo&s;es only on account <HI>of the hard|ne&s;s of their hearts;</HI> (&s;ee Matthew xix. 8.) I mean <HI>the giving a bill of divorce;</HI> for, in this ca&s;e (when a man was obliged to marry one whom he had &s;e|duced) he might <HI>not put her away all his days.</HI> (See Deut. xxii. 28.)&mdash;A puni&s;hment of greater morti|fication to the Jews than any other, which the learned Philo (though him&s;elf a Jew) candidly ac|knowledges <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Fol. 789. Paris Edition, 1640.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">This certainly was a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for &s;ecrecy on the man's part; &s;o that, whether <HI>his way</HI> (or behaviour) <HI>with a maid</HI> was really criminal, or only imprudent (for either of them may be implied in the text) he would, as much as po&s;&s;ible, conceal it from the world, and render it as <HI>uninve&s;tigable</HI> as the other things mentioned in the text to be too wonderful for Solomon; at lea&s;t his be&s;t endea|vours would not be wanting to make it &s;o.</P>
<P>Neither can we &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ame earne&s;t en|deavours would be wanting on the young woman's part to conceal her di&s;grace from her friends as long as &s;he could. But the rea&s;ons for &s;ecrecy are far more obvious in the ca&s;e of e&s;pou&s;ed virgins; for, according to the law of Mo&s;es (Deut. xxii. 23, 24.) if a man was ba&s;e enough to &s;educe one of the&s;e, an ignominious death was to be the immediate and dreadful con&s;equence of a di&s;covery; when both parties mu&s;t &s;hare the &s;ame wretched fate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxii. 23, 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Now if all that I have &s;aid &s;hall not be thought &s;ufficient to prove that <GAP DESC="foreign"> in this pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ignify a maid or virgin, I have never|thele&s;s the &s;atisfaction of ob&s;erving that the author of the objections, in page 20, allows it to be <Q>a very ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;age;</Q> and profe&s;&s;es to <Q>lay no &s;tre&s;s upon it;</Q> and therefore, I think, I may &s;afely conclude, at lea&s;t, that it is incapable of
<PB N="10" REF="11">
proving any thing again&s;t the true &s;en&s;e of the word in the other pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>The &s;ame author ob&s;erves in page 19, that "other <HI>four places are ab&s;olutely uncertain;</HI>" but they appear in a very different light to me.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t of the&s;e places (Gene&s;is xxiv. 43.) the word is applied to Rebekah before her mar|riage, who in the &s;ame chapter is &s;aid expre&s;ly to be a <HI>virgin</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) <Q>neither had any man known her.</Q> (See 16th ver&s;e.)</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place (Exodus ii. 8.) it is applied to Mo&s;es's &s;i&s;ter, who watched her infant brother during the time of his being expo&s;ed in the little ark of bulru&s;hes.</P>
<P>Now it does not appear that Mo&s;es had any other &s;i&s;ter be&s;ides Miriam the prophete&s;s; (&s;ee Numb. xxvi. 59. and Exodus xv. 20.) and why her cha&s;|tity &s;hould be called in que&s;tion (e&s;pecially &s;o early in life) I know not!</P>
<P>In the third place (P&s;alm lxviii. 25.) this word with the context expre&s;&s;es the dam&s;els playing with timbrels in the &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ions of the &s;anctuary; who, had they been dam&s;els &s;u&s;pected of having <HI>"wrought folly in I&s;rael,"</HI> (Deut. xxii. 21. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&mdash;<Q>that &s;he die: becau&s;e &s;he <HI>hath wrought folly in I&s;rael,</HI> to play the whore in her father's hou&s;e: &s;o &s;halt thou put evil away from among you.</Q></NOTE>) they, &s;urely, would not have been permitted to join in this divine &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">The la&s;t of the&s;e four places, which the Doctor thinks <HI>"ab&s;olutely uncertain,"</HI> is Canticles i. 3. where the &s;ame word is applied to the virgins that waited on Solomon's &s;pou&s;e. But this uncertainty is ea&s;ily removed by the other pa&s;&s;age in Canticles (chap. vi. ver. 8.) where the &s;ame word is happily applied to the &s;ame per&s;ons; who mu&s;t be under|&s;tood to be virgins, becau&s;e (as Dr. W&mdash;ms him|&s;elf acknowledges in page 29 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&mdash; <Q>I &s;hall here add further, that <GAP DESC="foreign"> occurs only &s;even times in all; one of which has the appearance of <HI>being deci&s;ive in the ca&s;e,</HI> namely, Canticles vi. 8. where virgins <HI>are di&s;tingui&s;hed from queens and concubines.</HI> But this di&s;tinction is no proof at all, becau&s;e, the &s;ame; in|deed, a &s;tronger di&s;tinction is made, Ezek. xliv. 22. in favour of <GAP DESC="foreign">.</Q></NOTE>) they <Q>are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from queens and concubines.</Q></P>
<P>This one would &s;uppo&s;e to be an in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacle to the Doctor's argument; but he pa&s;&s;es very &s;lightly over the difficulty, and contents him|&s;elf with informing us, that <Q><HI>this di&s;tinction</HI> is no proof at all, becau&s;e, the &s;ame; indeed, a &s;tronger di&s;tinction is made, Ezek. <HI>xliv. 22.</HI> in favour of <GAP DESC="foreign">.</Q></P>
<P>Now I hope the Doctor will excu&s;e my want of di&s;cernment in not being able to di&s;cover <HI>the weight of this rea&s;on</HI> again&s;t &s;o &s;trong a proof, as the di&s;|tinction in que&s;tion; becau&s;e, if <GAP DESC="foreign"> is proved,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
ever &s;o clearly, to &s;ignify &s;trictly <HI>a virgin</HI> (and in|deed I know no rea&s;on why any per&s;on &s;hould doubt of it) yet it is no argument why the other may not <HI>likewi&s;e &s;ignify the &s;ame thing;</HI> for the word <HI>maid,</HI> by having this &s;ignification in Engli&s;h, does not oblige us to give a different &s;ignification to the Engli&s;h word <HI>virgin:</HI> therefore I think I may &s;afely conclude in the Doctor's own words, that this la&s;t text <Q>has the appearance of being deci&s;ive in the ca&s;e;</Q> (&s;ee page 29.) and that the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> cannot &s;ignify a young woman that is not a virgin, becau&s;e, by the &s;ame word in the plural number (according to the author's own ob&s;ervation) <Q>vir|gins <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The ingenious author of the new tran&s;lation of Solo|mon's Song ob&s;erves in his annotations, p. 69, that <Q>the Jewi&s;h maidens before marriage were under &s;uch &s;trict confinement, and &s;o rarely &s;uffered to appear in public, that the very name for a virgin in Hebrew is <GAP DESC="foreign"> hidden.</Q></P>
<P>This word is well explained by the learned Stockins, p. 820.</P>

<P><PB N="13" REF="14">I propo&s;e now to examine whether we may &s;afely acquie&s;ce with the author of the Critical Di&s;&s;erta|tion, fo. 44. and the authors of the Critical Review (No 136, fo. 359.) in their opinion, that I&s;aiah in his prophecy concerning Immanuel, in the &s;eventh chapter, 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th ver&s;es, <Q>had no reference to the Me&s;&s;iah.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. W&mdash;ms objects (in page 9.) that the 16th ver&s;e of the &s;eventh chapter of I&s;aiah <Q>cannot, in any &s;en&s;e, be applied to the Me&s;&s;iah.</Q> The words of this text, according to the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation, are as follows: <Q>For before <HI>the child &s;hall</HI> know to refu&s;e the evil, and choo&s;e the good, the land that thou abhorre&s;t &s;hall be for&s;aken of both her kings.</Q></P>
<P>This ver&s;e &s;eems to be the principal cau&s;e of his objections again&s;t the common interpretation of the two preceding ver&s;es.</P>
<P>Now, though I do not think with him that the&s;e three ver&s;es <HI>mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, relate</HI> to the &s;ame per|&s;on; yet I apprehend there is a great probability
<PB N="14" REF="15">
that <HI>they may;</HI> and that the 16th ver&s;e may rea&s;on|ably be accounted for, even when applied to the Me&s;&s;iah.

Thus far he favours the explication which I propo&s;e to give of this pa&s;&s;age; but then he &s;uppo&s;es that <HI>the land which Ahaz vexed</HI> &s;ignifies the land of Judah <HI>only.</HI> <Q><HI>The prophet meant</HI> to &s;ay, according to this au|thor (&s;ays the Doctor) that the land <HI>of Judah,</HI> which Ahaz by his idolatry and wickedne&s;s had brought into trouble and difficulty, &s;hould be delivered from <HI>both the&s;e kings:</HI></Q> (fo. 35.) by which the Doctor refers to <HI>Re&s;in</HI> king of Syria, and <HI>Pekah</HI> the &s;on of Remaliah king of I&s;rael, who at that time were confederate again&s;t <HI>Judah,</HI> and <Q>went up towards Jeru&s;alem to war again&s;t it.</Q> See the fir&s;t part of the &s;ame chapter.&mdash;The Doctor repeats the &s;ame thing in page 37&mdash;viz.&mdash;the land <HI>(of Ju|dah)</HI> which thou (Ahaz) vexe&s;t, &amp;c.

<P>Now the difficulty cea&s;es, if it be admitted that the <HI>land which Ahaz vexed</HI> &s;ignified the land or in|heritance of the twelve tribes of I&s;rael, including Judah; which con&s;truction the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e times will enable it to bear.</P>
<P>Ahaz had interrupted the &s;acrifices of atonement u&s;ually offered up for <HI>all I&s;rael</HI> in the temple at Jeru&s;alem, which was common to Jews and I&s;rae|lites; and therefore might truly be &s;aid to <HI>vex</HI> the land of I&s;rael, as well as Judah: for he not only <HI>"&s;acrificed unto the gods of Dama&s;cus"</HI> (2 Chron. xxviii. 23.) but he <Q>cut in pieces the ve&s;&s;els of the hou&s;e of God, and <HI>&s;hut up the doors of the hou&s;e of the Lord</HI></Q> (24th ver&s;e).

<P>He likewi&s;e <Q>&s;ent to <HI>all I&s;rael</HI> and Judah, and wrote letters al&s;o to Ephraim and Mana&s;&s;eh, that they &s;hould come to the hou&s;e of the Lord at Jeru&s;alem, to keep the pa&s;&s;over unto the Lord God <HI>of I&s;rael.</HI></Q> 2 Chron. xxx. 1.

<P>When I fir&s;t wrote this opinion, and communi|cated the MS. to Dr. W&mdash;ms, I apprehended that the thought was intirely new;&mdash;&s;o little am I ac|quainted with the republic of letters, for want of lei&s;ure and opportunity to read! I mu&s;t therefore

acknowledge my&s;elf obliged to Dr. W&mdash;ms for his information, that the learned Mr. Mann, in his di&s;&s;ertation De anno natali Chri&s;ti, <Q>appears to be of the &s;ame opinion.</Q> I had likewi&s;e the &s;atisfac|tion, afterwards, to be informed by another gen|tleman (a worthy friend of mine) that the &s;ame in|terpretation is recommended in the Univer&s;al Hi&s;t. vol.

<P>Now, that the opinion of the learned author may more clearly be under&s;tood, I will &s;et down at length the whole that he wrote upon the text in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the &s;ubject of I&s;aiah's me&s;|&s;age to Ahaz, he adds&mdash; <Q>Here the king, whe|ther out of re&s;pect or de&s;pondency and unbelief, &mdash;refu&s;ing to a&s;k the promi&s;ed &s;ign, the prophet a&s;&s;ured him from the Lord, that&mdash;before <HI>that time</HI> came, a virgin &s;hould conceive and bear a &s;on, and call his name Himmanuel, or God with us; and &s;o on.</Q> (K).</P>
<P>Upon this opinion he further explains him&s;elf in the following note:</P>
<P><Q>(K) This we take to be a much more natural &s;en&s;e of that prophecy than to &s;uppo&s;e, as &s;ome have done, that &s;uch a miraculous child was really born in Ahaz's time, to a&s;&s;ure him of the promi&s;ed deliverance; for as there is not the lea&s;t mention of &s;uch an extraordinary birth, &s;o neither do we &s;ee that there was any nece&s;&s;ity for
<PB N="22" REF="23">
it, in order to convince the de&s;ponding king, who could not be ignorant of that prophecy of Jacob, that the &s;ceptre &s;hould not depart from Judah, till Shiloh was come, much le&s;s, that he was to &s;pring of the lineage of David. But what &s;taggered Ahaz's faith, and made him fear that the regal power was going to depart from his family, was, that his two enemies had combined to &s;et a &s;tranger on his throne. All, therefore, that was wanting to di&s;pel his pre&s;ent fears about it, was for the prophet to a&s;&s;ure him from God, that this Shiloh, promi&s;ed to Judah and David, who was to fore-run the total exci&s;ion of the Jewi&s;h polity, was to be born in a miraculous manner and with a divine character, and other remarkable circum&s;tances, &s;uch as, he might be ea&s;ily &s;atisfied, had not as yet happened in his kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As for that part of the prophecy which is com|monly urged on the other &s;ide, namely, <Q>Before this wonderful child &s;hall know good from evil, the land which thou abhorre&s;t &s;hall be for&s;aken of both her kings:</Q> We think, that if it be rightly un|der&s;tood, it will rather confirm our &s;en&s;e of the prophecy, and that the words ought to be thus rendered. For (or rather, as the particle <HI>chi</HI> &s;eems to import here, nay) before this child can know good from evil, this land, which thou (not abhorre&s;t, as our ver&s;ion renders it, but) art &s;o
<PB N="23" REF="24">
&s;olicitous about, or give&s;t up for lo&s;t, &s;hall be bereaved of both her kings; by which, we think, ought to be under&s;tood, not the kings of Syria and I&s;rael, for the former could not be called her (Canaan's) king; and the latter had but a &s;hare in it at be&s;t; <HI>but the kings of I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> as it really was before the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah.</Q></P>
<P>In order to confirm this opinion, I have annexed to the&s;e remarks two di&s;tinct di&s;&s;ertations: one on the prophecy of I&s;aiah vii. 8. (&mdash;<Q>and within three&s;core and five years &s;hall Ephraim be bro|ken that it be not a people</Q>); and the other on the famous prophecy of Jacob, concerning the &s;ceptre of Judah.</P>
<P>In the former I &s;hew, that the <HI>regal government</HI> of the <HI>hou&s;e of I&s;rael,</HI> as a &s;eparate &s;tate from Ju|dah, was put an end to not a great many years after I&s;aiah's prophecy.</P>
<P>In the latter (I hope) I have proved that the re|gal government of the hou&s;e of Judah (I mean only the temporal or worldly kingdom of Judah) cea&s;ed preci&s;ely at the time limited by I&s;aiah in the prophecy now before us. So that, I flatter my&s;elf, it will appear upon the whole, that the land of I&s;|rael, including Judah (being the land which Ahaz <HI>vexed</HI>) was for&s;aken of <HI>"both her kings,"</HI> or regal governments, before the child Immanuel could <HI>"know to refu&s;e the evil and choo&s;e the good."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">For Herod the Great, on a careful examination (I believe) will be found to have been the la&s;t king of <HI>the whole land</HI> of <HI>I&s;rael and Judah,</HI> which Ahaz <HI>vexed;</HI> and it is remarkable, that Chri&s;t, the true Immanuel, <HI>was a young child in the arms of his mother</HI> at the time of this monarch's death; &s;oon after which, Jo&s;eph, the hu&s;band of the ble&s;&s;ed vir|gin, was warned by an angel of the Lord in Egypt, &s;aying, <Q>Ari&s;e, and take THE YOUNG CHILD and his mother, and go into the <HI>land of I&s;rael</HI></Q> (not the land of <HI>Judah</HI> only) <Q>for they are <HI>dead</HI> which &s;ought the <HI>young child</HI>'s life.</Q> Matth. ii. 20.</P>
<P>But Dr. W&mdash;ms in a note (page 32.) ob&s;erves, that the child Immanuel <Q>could not be Chri&s;t, <HI>be|cau&s;e</HI> he is never called the king of Judah.</Q> And he thinks that Nathaniel, when he called him <HI>the king of I&s;rael,</HI> <Q><HI>laboured</HI> under the &s;ame mi&s;take with all his countrymen, who expected a tem|poral Me&s;&s;iah.</Q> The Doctor ob&s;erves in the &s;ame note, that <HI>"Chri&s;t is king of the whole earth;"</HI> which he &s;eems to a&s;&s;ign as a rea&s;on, why <Q>he is never called the king of Judah.</Q></P>
<P>And indeed it does not appear that the Doctor had any other foundation for his cen&s;ure of Natha|niel; though this argument is &s;o far from being conclu&s;ive in favour of the Doctor's opinion, that it rather proves the contrary; for he that is king of <HI>the whole earth</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, in a general &s;en&s;e, be king of I&s;rael and Judah; the&s;e titles
<PB N="25" REF="26">
being mo&s;t certainly included in the former, even &s;uppo&s;ing the peculiar &s;ceptre of each kingdom to be departed.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the argument (&s;uch as it is) is ad|mitted and approved by the Critical Reviewers! for they quote the Doctor's words at length (&s;ee N^o 136, fo. 356.) without offering any thing to ju&s;|tify Nathaniel from the charge of <HI>labouring under a mi&s;take.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;hall therefore be my bu&s;ine&s;s to prove, that the mi&s;take does <HI>not re&s;t with Nathaniel.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;t is in a peculiar manner eternal king of Judah and I&s;rael, as well as king of the whole earth, and <HI>heir of all things.</HI> (Heb. i. 2.) The angel Ga|briel te&s;tified that Chri&s;t &s;hould <HI>reign over the hou&s;e of Jacob (which is I&s;rael)</HI> for ever. See St. Luke i. 32. And the wi&s;e men of the Ea&s;t <HI>went to Je|ru&s;alem</HI> and inquired, <Q>Where is he that <HI>is born king of the Jews?</HI> for we have &s;een his &s;tar in the Ea&s;t, and come</Q> (that is, to Jeru&s;alem, the capital of his kingdom) <HI>"to wor&s;hip him."</HI> See Matth. ii. 1, 2. Therefore the Doctor's objection that the child Immanuel could not be Chri&s;t, <HI>be|cau&s;e he is never called the king of Judah,</HI> &s;eems to be intirely groundle&s;s; for the dominion of the land of Immanuel (mentioned in the eighth chapter of I&s;aiah) may mo&s;t certainly be attributed with more propriety to the Me&s;&s;iah, who <HI>was king</HI> and <HI>&s;hep|herd
<PB N="26" REF="27">
of I&s;rael</HI> (&s;ee Ezek. xxxvii. 24. al&s;o xxxiv. 23, 24.) than to any &s;on of I&s;aiah whatever.</P>
<P>Dr. W&mdash;ms may, perhaps, &s;uppo&s;e, that the king|doms of I&s;rael and Judah could not belong to Chri&s;t, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to accept of any temporal go|vernment, and withdrew him&s;elf when he perceived that the people would come, and take him by force to <HI>make him a king;</HI> (&s;ee John vi. 15.) and further, becau&s;e he even declared that his kingdom was not of this world. See chap. xviii. 36. But all this &s;eems to relate only to the manner of his govern|ment, which, in general, was merely &s;piritual. He was neverthele&s;s <HI>king of I&s;rael,</HI> being &s;ent in a par|ticular manner to the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;|rael; (&s;ee Matth. xv. 24.) and, for a time, Jeru&s;a|lem was <HI>the &s;eat of his kingdom,</HI> when he went up to the fea&s;t; and a very great multitude &s;pread their garments in the way (a greater mark of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion than is ever paid to temporal princes) and others cut down branches from the trees, and &s;trawed them in the way (&s;ee Matth. xxi. 8.) and cried, <HI>Ho&s;anna, Ble&s;&s;ed is the</HI> KING OF ISRAEL that cometh in the name of the Lord. John xii. 13.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t did not tell the multitude that they <Q><HI>la|boured</HI> under a mi&s;take</Q> in calling him KING OF ISRAEL; on the contrary it appears, that he ap|proved of the voice of the people; which could not have been the ca&s;e, had he not been really <HI>king of I&s;rael:</HI> for when the phari&s;ees &s;aid unto him,

But though Chri&s;t profe&s;&s;ed that his kingdom was not of this world, yet there was no worldly man hardy enough to re&s;i&s;t or oppo&s;e his will, when he was plea&s;ed to exert his divine authority over them; for <Q>he ca&s;t out them that &s;old and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money|changers, and the &s;eats of them that &s;old doves; and <HI>would not &s;uffer</HI> that any man &s;hould carry any ve&s;&s;el through the temple.</Q> Mark xi. 15, 16.</P>

<P>The Doctor animadverts &s;everely on the opinion of tho&s;e who &s;ay, that the pa&s;&s;age contains two di&s;|tinct prophecies;&mdash;viz. that the ver&s;es 14 and 15 relate to Chri&s;t, but the 16th to I&s;aiah's &s;on. <Q>Is not this <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> very unnatural? and, if I am not mi&s;taken, very unu&s;ual?</Q></P>
<P>But the authors of the old commentary on the Bible, commonly called A&s;&s;emblies Annotations, were of a very different opinion.</P>
<P>They ob&s;erve on this very text, that <Q><HI>it is an u&s;ual thing</HI> in Scripture, with our prophet I&s;aiah e&s;pecially, by way of allu&s;ion, to apply the &s;ame words and phra&s;es unto divers &s;ubjects, where occa&s;ion is to &s;peak of them together:</Q> and therefore they were of opinion, that the child men|tioned in the 16th ver&s;e was <Q>no other, in all like|lihood, than Shearja&s;hub, the prophet's child, whom, to this purpo&s;e, God hath commanded him to take along with him.</Q> How far this was

an u&s;ual thing with I&s;aiah, may be &s;een even in prophecies which were delivered on the &s;ame occa|&s;ion as the text in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>For the further illu&s;tration of this point, I have added to my book a &s;hort di&s;&s;ertation on the nature and &s;tyle of prophetical writings, &s;hewing, that abrupt tran&s;itions from one &s;ubject to another are frequently found therein; and that the Holy Scrip|tures afford many examples of prophecies, which are blended and interwoven with other &s;ubjects that are intirely different, both as to the matter and the time of accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not expect to find all prophecies unat|tended with difficulties: neverthele&s;s, there are no difficulties in the &s;eventh chapter of I&s;aiah &s;o great as tho&s;e, that are occa&s;ioned by Dr. W&mdash;ms's in|terpretation of it. <Q>This prophecy (&s;ays he) as I take it, relates to <HI>one per&s;on only,</HI> and that <HI>was the &s;on of a young woman then pre&s;ent;</HI> which &s;on was afterwards to be born.</Q> See page 4.</P>

<P>He informs us, that <Q>the birth of Je&s;us Chri&s;t was on this wi&s;e: When as his mother Mary was e&s;pou&s;ed to Jo&s;eph, before they came toge|ther, &s;he was found with <HI>child of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Then Jo&s;eph her hu&s;band, being a ju&s;t man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.

<P>For if this were true, that <GAP DESC="foreign"> doth not &s;ig|nify a virgin, in what &s;en&s;e could the text be e&s;teemed <HI>remarkably &s;uitable</HI> to the miraculous con|ception of a VIRGIN by the HOLY GHOST? and in what manner could the <HI>accommodation of it</HI> to that <HI>&s;ingular event</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;acred hi&s;torian <Q>BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION?</Q> (See page 40.)</P>

Rezin and Pekah are both particularly mentioned in the 7th chapter, wherein the extraordinary birth of the <HI>child Immanuel</HI> is given as a &s;ign.

<P>Now, in one re&s;pect, the Dr. is right, viz. that the pa&s;&s;age, with regard to the people of I&s;rael, <Q>is a declaration of an event long pa&s;t:</Q> neverthele&s;s he has not a&s;&s;igned any rea&s;on why the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age may not, <HI>likewi&s;e,</HI> contain a prophecy <HI>of a future event,</HI> by being intended, like many other prophe|cies, to bear a double application.</P>

<PB N="27" REF="71">
between two di&s;tinct per&s;ons, who are both men|tioned in this la&s;t (the 7th) ver&s;e; viz. "the Lord (<GAP DESC="foreign">) the Redeemer of I&s;rael," and <Q>his <HI>Holy One,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) whom man <HI>de&s;pi&s;eth,</HI></Q> and who is al&s;o called <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the former part of this chapter. Now it is remarkable, that the people of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> or tribes of <HI>Jacob,</HI> are likewi&s;e di&s;tinctly mentioned in the &s;ame prophecy; &s;o that the per&s;on, to whom the Lord &s;aid, <HI>"Thou art my &s;ervant, O I&s;rael,"</HI> (&s;ee 3d ver&s;e) cannot mean any other per&s;on be&s;ides the Me&s;&s;iah him&s;elf; he alone being the true <Q>light to lighten the Gentiles, <HI>and</HI> the glory of his people <HI>ISRAEL.</HI></Q> For though the <HI>Jewi&s;h Religion</HI> was for many ages the only true religion, yet the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were not induced, univer&s;ally, to acknowledge the truth of the Holy Scriptures by becoming pro&s;elytes to <HI>Judai&s;m,</HI> but by being <HI>converts to Chri&s;t,</HI> by whom alone they have been <HI>enlightened</HI> according to the Scriptures. If all the&s;e things be con&s;idered, they will (I doubt not) afford &s;ufficient proof, that the text quoted by St. Matthew from Ho&s;ea xi. 1.

<P>If all this be con&s;idered, I think, the fitne&s;s of St. Matthew's appeal to the prophets, concerning the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, cannot be called in que&s;tion, unle&s;s, like the <HI>Critical Reviewers</HI> (fol. 357.) we &s;hould believe from Dr. W&mdash;ms's <HI>bare word,</HI> that <GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;ignifies a <HI>Nazorite,</HI> which interpretation would, indeed, render it impo&s;&s;ible <Q><HI>to reconcile Matthew</HI> ii. 23. <HI>with any particular prophecy</HI> now extant in the Old Te&s;tament,</Q> according to the Doctor's a&s;&s;ertion in page 38.</P>
<P>For the Dr. informs us in the following page (39) that <HI>"the word is not</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>a Nazarene, but</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>a Nazorite:"</HI> neverthele&s;s it is certain,
<PB N="33" REF="77">
that both the&s;e words &s;ignify the <HI>&s;ame thing,</HI> viz. <HI>a Nazarene</HI> (or inhabitant of <HI>Nazareth</HI>); and like|wi&s;e, that neither of them can &s;ignify a <HI>Nazarite,</HI> or (as he &s;pells it) <HI>Nazorite.</HI></P>
<P>For the Hebrew word <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>&s;eparatus,</HI> from whence the&s;e la&s;t (<HI>Nazarite</HI> or <HI>Nazorite</HI>) are derived, is no where in Scripture rendered <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <GAP DESC="foreign">, but is di&s;tingui&s;hed from them by an <HI>iota</HI> in the &s;econd &s;yllable, viz. <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>a Nazarite,</HI> Judges xiii. 5. and <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Nazarites,</HI> Lamentations iv. 7.

<P>The latter, however, may indeed be con&s;idered as a &s;ign, or type, of the <HI>great and la&s;t day;</HI> and the accompli&s;hment of the prophecies concerning it is undoubtedly a &s;ure pledge of <HI>God's future</HI> judgment:

<P>THE accompli&s;hment of I&s;aiah's prophecy (in confirmation of which he required Ahaz to a&s;k a &s;ign) was not <Q>an event near at hand,</Q> as Dr. W&mdash;ms &s;uppo&s;es; for no le&s;s a term than &s;ixty-five years was allowed for the accompli&s;hment of one of the circum&s;tances con|tained in it; viz.&mdash; <Q><HI>within three&s;core and five years</HI> &s;hall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.</Q> I&s;aiah vii. 8.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the king, or regal government of Ephraim (or I&s;rael, for Ephraim in this text &s;eems to be put for the ten tribes of I&s;rael, as &s;eparated
<PB N="4" REF="82">
from Judah) la&s;ted no longer than about twenty-one years after the prophecy was delivered; for <HI>"in the ninth year of Ho&s;hea"</HI> (the &s;ixth of Heze|kiah) <Q>the king of A&s;&s;yria took Samaria, and car|ried I&s;rael away into A&s;&s;yria,</Q> (2 Kings xvii. 6.) therefore commentators have generally found it very difficult to account for the number of <HI>&s;ixty-five years</HI> mentioned in this prophecy.</P>
<P>A very learned and ju&s;tly e&s;teemed author <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Newton on the Prophecies.</NOTE>, in order to &s;olve the difficulty, has applied &s;everal texts in the &s;econd book of Kings to an imaginary cap|tivity or carrying away by E&s;arhaddon, which, if the context be carefully con&s;idered, will be found to relate, undoubtedly, to the <HI>real</HI> captivity under Salmana&s;&s;er. We under&s;tand, indeed, from Ezra iv. 2. that the adver&s;aries of Benjamin and Judah (the Samaritans) dated the time of their &s;ettlement in the cities of Samaria from <Q>the days of E&s;ar|haddon king of A&s;&s;ur, which <HI>(as they &s;aid)</HI> brought us up hither.</Q> But there is no nece&s;&s;ity to &s;uppo&s;e, that E&s;arhaddon carried any people away into captivity from thence, nor any evidence to &s;upport &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition. Was it not po&s;&s;ible for E&s;arhaddon to plant fre&s;h colonies in the land of I&s;rael, where it was too thinly inhabited by the former colonies, without having carried away any of the inhabitants into captivity? Surely it was not
<PB N="5" REF="83">
only po&s;&s;ible, but mo&s;t probable, that this was really the ca&s;e; notwith&s;tanding that &s;everal other learned men, be&s;ides Bp. Newton, have thought otherwi&s;e; and particularly Fr. Junius, quoted by Dr. Sim&s;on in his Chronicon Catholicum (pars 3tia, p. 69.) But the Doctor him&s;elf &s;ufficiently accounts for the pa&s;&s;ages in Ezra (ch. iv. 2 and 10.); &s;o that there is no nece&s;&s;ity to &s;uppo&s;e another captivity un|der E&s;arhaddon:&mdash; <Q>Quanquam enim Salmana&s;ar illam coloniam primus deduxerit, tamen cum plu|rimi incolarum &agrave; feris, &amp; fort&egrave; pe&s;tilenti&acirc; (&s;ic enim ait Jo&s;ephus libro nono) extincti e&s;&s;ent, po&s;|tea plures ab A&s;arhaddone illuc mi&s;&s;os fui&s;&s;e <HI>veri|&s;imile e&s;t.</HI></Q> And he likewi&s;e quotes Nicholaus Bra|bantinus to the &s;ame purpo&s;e:&mdash; <Q>Leones enim va&s;taverunt magnam partem populi quem Salma|na&s;&s;ar mi&s;erat: propter quod i&s;te A&s;arhaddon mi|&s;it alios loco ip&s;orum, &amp; cum iis unum de &s;acerdo|tibus captivis, qui doceret eos colere Dominum.</Q></P>
<P>The prophet does not &s;ay, that <HI>Ephraim &s;hall be broken from a kingdom in &s;ixty-five years,</HI> but that within &s;uch a time he &s;hall be <HI>broken from a people;</HI> therefore it is plain that the prophecy could not be accompli&s;hed by the captivity of Ephraim, and the de&s;truction of the <HI>regal government</HI> of Samaria by Salmana&s;&s;ar; becau&s;e Ephraim, or the children of I&s;rael, might be &s;till called <HI>a people,</HI> or nation, even after their removal into a &s;trange country, for they could not be &s;aid to <HI>"be broken from a people,"</HI>

<P>It appears from the hi&s;tory of Tobit, that this really came to pa&s;s; for he &s;peaks of the frequent &s;laughter made of <HI>the people</HI> of <HI>his nation</HI> by Sen|nacherib, chap. i. 17, 18, <Q>for in his wrath he &s;lew many.</Q> And even in the reign of E&s;arhad|don, about <HI>&s;ixty-five years</HI> after I&s;aiah's prophecy, notwith&s;tanding that Achiarcharus, Tobit's nephew, was appointed over all the king's affairs (21&s;t ver&s;e) we find an in&s;tance recorded of the continuation of this per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>For when Tobit was told (chap. ii. 3.) that one of his nation was &s;trangled, and ca&s;t out in the market-place, he remembered (6th ver&s;e) <Q><HI>that prophecy of Amos,</HI> as he &s;aid (&s;ee Amos viii. 10.)

<P>So we need not doubt but that, by this and other &s;uch heavy judgments of God, the captives of the ten tribes of I&s;rael would be &s;o much reduced in number within the <HI>term of three&s;core and five years</HI> mentioned by I&s;aiah, that Ephraim might well be &s;aid to <HI>be broken from a people;</HI> for we read in Deut. xxviii. 61, 62. <Q>Al&s;o every &s;ickne&s;s and every plague which is not written in the book of this law, them will the Lord bring upon thee, until thou be de&s;troyed.

<P>The completion of I&s;aiah's prophecy concerning Ephraim is very apparent, even in another way; for though &s;ome of Ephraim, and of all the other tribes, were afterwards &s;ettled in Judaea and other places; though we read of <HI>a remnant of I&s;rael</HI> (&s;ee 2 Chron. xxxiv. 9.) that contributed to the repair|ing of the temple in the reign of Jo&s;iah king of Judah, long after the completion of <HI>the &s;ixty-five years</HI> limited by I&s;aiah; and though Mana&s;&s;eh and Ephraim are expre&s;ly mentioned on the &s;ame occa|&s;ion; neverthele&s;s, this remnant of Ephraim, or I&s;|rael, could have no preten&s;ions, as before, to be e&s;teemed a &s;eparate people or nation from Judah, becau&s;e they were once more become &s;ubject to the laws and regal government of <HI>the tribe of Judah,</HI> of which the authority exerci&s;ed among them by Jo&s;iah is a &s;ufficient proof; and therefore, notwith|&s;tanding that on &s;ome particular occa&s;ions they were di&s;tingui&s;hed by their tribes, yet, as a body or nation, they were generally afterwards e&s;teemed a <HI>part of the tribe of Judah;</HI> which accounts for the expre&s;&s;ion of the hi&s;torian (2 Kings xvii. 18.) <HI>"There was none left but the tribe of Judah only;"</HI> that is, there was none left but part of the tribes of Levi, Benjamin, and &s;uch individuals of the other tribes as lived in (or might have e&s;caped into) the inheritance of Judah, and con&s;equently were

all con&s;idered as the proper &s;ubjects of <HI>the kingdom of Judah,</HI> and have ever &s;ince borne <HI>the name of that tribe,</HI> viz. <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Jews.</HI> Thus the title of <HI>Jews</HI> became general about this time to all the other tribes, as well as Judah; for the kingdom <HI>of I&s;rael</HI> was never afterwards re&s;tored in a &s;eparate &s;tate from Judah; and therefore after the captivity by Salmana&s;&s;ar, <HI>the land which Ahaz vexed</HI> might be &s;aid to <HI>"be for&s;aken of"</HI> one of <HI>"her kings,"</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"For before the child &s;hall know to refu&s;e the evil, and choo&s;e the good, the land that thou abhorre&s;t &s;hall be for&s;aken of BOTH HER KINGS."

<P>And I believe the Jews them&s;elves will not deny, that the &s;aid reigns include a part of the continuation of the &s;ceptre in Judah, as promi&s;ed by the patriarch Jacob: therefore, I pre&s;ume, it will not be nece&s;&s;ary for me to examine the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tories further back, than the time when the &s;ceptre was tran&s;lated into the family of Antipater; &s;o that I propo&s;e to begin this Di&s;&s;ertation where I left off in the la&s;t; viz. with the reign of Herod the Great.</P>

<P>But king Herod's claim of relation&s;hip did not depend upon this &s;ingle circum&s;tance of his being de&s;cended from the Idumaeans. His connections with the Jews were far greater than any other Idumaean could ever boa&s;t of! His father Antipater, though an Idumaean, was a per&s;on of &s;uch tru&s;t and e&s;teem among the Jews, that he held the greate&s;t offices under their kings.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="95">He &s;erved under their king Alexander <HI>as governor of Idumaea,</HI> (Antiq. book xiv. chap. 2. p. 469.) &mdash;under their king and high-prie&s;t Hyrcanus as <HI>governor of Judaea it&s;elf, and commander in chief of the Jewi&s;h army.</HI> And afterwards he &s;erved under Cae&s;ar al&s;o, as <HI>procurator of Judae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> See the xivth and xvth chapters of the &s;ame book.</P>

<P><PB N="7" REF="96">If all the&s;e circum&s;tances are con&s;idered, it will not be ea&s;y to prove, that the <HI>&s;on</HI> of &s;uch a per&s;on ought to be accounted a foreigner to the Jews. Herod was born a &s;ubject of the kingdom of the Jews, and publickly profe&s;&s;ed their religion, laws, and cu&s;toms, notwith&s;tanding that he frequently offended again&s;t them all: and if he did not think him&s;elf, in reality, intitled to be e&s;teemed one of that nation, he neverthele&s;s omitted no proper oppor|tunity of claiming relation&s;hip.

<P>There are many other in&s;tances in Jo&s;ephus of Herod's expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in this manner: and indeed the &s;ingular circum&s;tances of this monarch's connections with the Jews rendered his claim of relation&s;hip &s;o ju&s;t, that it could not be di&s;puted, although he was not de&s;cended of any of the twelve tribes.

<P>For the &s;aid prophecy does not (I apprehend) &s;o much relate to the de&s;cent or genealogy of the in|dividuals that were to rule in Judah, as to the par|ticular pre-eminence of that whole tribe, from which the &s;ceptre (the &s;ign of its being a di&s;tinct kingdom)

own confe&s;&s;ion, yet he was mo&s;t certainly the pro|phet promi&s;ed by <HI>Malachi</HI> under the prophetical appellation of <HI>Elijah,</HI> which denoted the excellency of his &s;piritual mi&s;&s;ion; for the angel Gabriel told his father Zacharias in the temple, that John &s;hould go before the Lord in the <HI>"&s;pirit and power of Elias."</HI> See St. Luke i. 17. And afterwards Chri&s;t him&s;elf bore witne&s;s of him&mdash; <Q><HI>if ye will receive it,</HI> this is Elias <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See al&s;o Matthew xvii. 10&mdash;13.</NOTE> which was for to come;</Q> (Matt. xi. 14.) and in the &s;ame chapter he calls him <Q>a prophet, yea, and more than a prophet;</Q> he being the Lord's me&s;&s;enger promi&s;ed by Malachi iii. 1. to prepare his way before him.</P>
<P>John was likewi&s;e a lawgiver (<GAP DESC="foreign">) as well as a prophet and me&s;&s;enger; for <Q><HI>there went out to him</HI> Jeru&s;alem and all Judea, and all the region round <HI>about Jordan.</HI></Q> Matth. iii. 5.

The&s;e te&s;timonies of the Evangeli&s;ts in favour of John are confirmed in no &s;mall degree even by the <HI>Jewi&s;h hi&s;torian</HI> Jo&s;ephus, who calls him <Q><GAP DESC="foreign">, a good man</Q> &mdash;for indeed his life and conver&s;a|tion

<P>In the 5th chapter (31&s;t ver&s;e) of the &s;ame Evan|geli&s;t we read, that this remarkable te&s;timony was afterwards referred to by Chri&s;t him&s;elf. <Q>If I bear witne&s;s of my&s;elf (&s;aid Chri&s;t) my witne&s;s is not true.

<P>The mercy of God, therefore, is apparent in this conde&s;cen&s;ion; and though our Lord him&s;elf de|clared, that he received not <HI>"te&s;timony from man;"</HI> yet he added&mdash;<HI>"but the&s;e things"</HI> (relating to John's te&s;timony) <HI>"I &s;ay, that ye might be &s;aved."</HI></P>
<P>He then gives a mo&s;t lively and comprehen&s;ive (though &s;hort) de&s;cription of the holy character of this his harbinger. <HI>"He was"</HI> (&s;ays our Lord) <HI>"a burning, and a &s;hining light;"</HI>&mdash;and he re|minds the Jews, that they formerly te&s;tified a very particular approbation of this holy per&s;on: <Q>and ye were willing</Q> (&s;ays he) <Q>for a &s;ea&s;on <HI>to rejoice in his light.</HI> But I have greater witne&s;s than that of <HI>John:</HI> for <HI>the works</HI> which the Father hath given me to fini&s;h, the &s;ame works that I do, <HI>bear witne&s;s</HI> of me, that the Father hath &s;ent me. <HI>And the Father him&s;elf,</HI> which hath &s;ent me, hath borne witne&s;s of me.

<PB N="32" REF="121">
the Scriptures,</HI> for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which te&s;tify of me.</Q> Thus Chri&s;t pointed out to the Jews three inconte&s;tible indications of the truth of his holy doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The te&s;timony of John the Bapti&s;t, with which he <HI>indulged</HI> them, though the &s;ame might be e&s;teemed unnece&s;&s;ary for the cau&s;e of him, who "<HI>receives not te&s;timony</HI> from man."</P>
<P N="2">2dly. His own <HI>mighty works,</HI> daily wrought among them, which, as he &s;aid, <Q><HI>bear witne&s;s</HI> of me, that the Father hath &s;ent me.</Q></P>
<P>And 3dly. The <HI>witne&s;s of the Father him&s;elf,</HI> though (as Chri&s;t expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Jews) <Q>Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor &s;een his &s;hape;</Q> but he &s;eems plainly to direct them to that <HI>witne&s;s of God,</HI> which has in all ages been apparent in the accompli&s;hment of the <HI>word of the Lord by his prophets.</HI></P>
<P>Even the unbelieving Jews them&s;elves pretended to believe <HI>the Scriptures,</HI> and acknowledged them to be <HI>the word of God;</HI> and therefore Chri&s;t referred them to the Scriptures, as being <HI>the witne&s;s</HI> of the Father him&s;elf. <HI>"Search the Scriptures,"</HI> &amp;c. But they wilfully neglected to make a right u&s;e of &s;uch ample te&s;timony; and were, therefore, inex|cu&s;able. "Do not think" (&s;aid Chri&s;t) <Q>that I will accu&s;e you to the Father: there is one that accu&s;eth you, <HI>even Mo&s;es in whom ye tru&s;t.</HI> For had ye believed Mo&s;es, ye would have believed
<PB N="33" REF="122">
me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not <HI>his writings,</HI> how &s;hall ye believe my words?</Q></P>
<P>In the very next chapter (vi. 1, 2.) the Evan|geli&s;t relates the accompli&s;hment of one of the circum&s;tances of Jacob's prophecy, as recorded by Mo&s;es; viz.&mdash; <Q>and unto him &s;hall the gathering of the people be.</Q></P>
<P>"After the&s;e things" (&s;ays St. John) <Q>Je&s;us went over the &s;ea of Galilee, which is the &s;ea of Tibe|rias, and A GREAT MULTITUDE FOLLOWED HIM, <HI>becau&s;e they &s;aw his miracles,</HI></Q> &amp;c. And again (14th and 15th ver&s;es) "then tho&s;e men" (the five thou&s;and per&s;ons, who were fed by Chri&s;t with five barley loaves and two &s;mall fi&s;hes) <Q>when they had &s;een the miracle that Je&s;us did, &s;aid, This is of a truth that prophet <HI>that &s;hould come into</HI> the world. When Je&s;us therefore perceived that they would come and <HI>take him by force, to make him a king</HI></Q> (for they could not po&s;&s;ibly give him a greater proof of their &s;incerity in <HI>gathering to him</HI> as the true Shiloh) <Q>he departed again into a mountain him|&s;elf alone.</Q></P>
<P>The people of I&s;rael (as Mr. Mann ob&s;erves in his learned treati&s;e de Anno Natali Chri&s;ti, p. 4.) were not the only people that were to be <HI>gathered</HI> unto Shiloh; not one nation only is pointed at in the prophecy, <HI>but many nations.</HI> The patriarch's words were not <GAP DESC="foreign"> the gathering <HI>of this people,</HI> or nation, but in the plural number <GAP DESC="foreign"> the gathering <HI>of the nations;</HI> which has been
<PB N="34" REF="123">
apparently fulfilled: for the nations have at dif|ferent times almo&s;t univer&s;ally &s;ubmitted to the faith of our Lord Je&s;us, the true Shiloh; notwith|&s;tanding that many have &s;ince fallen back into gro&s;s ignorance, &s;uper&s;tition, and unbelief<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have a dreadful example of this in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the once enlightened Grecian empire, of the greate&s;t part of A&s;ia, and of almo&s;t the whole va&s;t continent of Africa. Nay, the greate&s;t part even of Europe it&s;elf hath long &s;ince re&s;umed the veil of its former darkne&s;s, and the &s;hadow of death: for the &s;uper&s;titious vanities of Rome bear too great a re&s;emblance to the old Heathen idolatries; and the multitude of Athei&s;ts, Dei&s;ts, and of tho&s;e who neglect Chri&s;t's holy &s;acraments, is an alarming indication of a <HI>falling off</HI> even among our&s;elves.</NOTE>. The <HI>gather|ing of the people</HI> to impo&s;tors does not at all affect the certainty of the &s;ign given by the patriarch Jacob in <HI>the gathering of the people</HI> to Shiloh.</P>

<P>Even the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> hi&s;torian Jo&s;ephus gives ample te&s;timony of the pronene&s;s of his countrymen to error and fal&s;e doctrine, and that they were ea&s;ily led away by impo&s;tors and deceivers. He relates a very remarkable in&s;tance of it, in their being led out by an Egyptian to the mount of Olives; from whence he had undertaken to &s;hew them a won|derful &s;pectacle, viz. that the walls of Jeru&s;alem &s;hould fall at his command <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Antiq. book xx. chap. 6. p. 695.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;piritual blindne&s;s continued even after <HI>the abomination of de&s;olation,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the apparent judgment of God upon them, in the de|&s;truction of their great (and once holy) city: for they have (as readily &s;ince that time, as before) acknowledged the incredible preten&s;ions of &s;everal impo&s;tors, who have at different times &s;et them&s;elves up for the true Me&s;&s;iah. For in&s;tance, the infamous Barchocheba (<GAP DESC="foreign"> or, <HI>Son of a Star</HI>) in the reign of the emperor Adrian, was gladly received, and zealou&s;ly &s;upported among the Jews, until an immen&s;e &s;laughter of his mi&s;erable adherents plainly demon&s;trated that he was more properly intitled Bar|chozba

<HEAD><PB REF="127">AN ANSWER TO Some of the principal Arguments u&s;ed by Dr. W&mdash;MS in Defence of his Critical Di&s;&s;er|tation on ISAIAH vii. 13, 14, 15, 16, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE pointed out to Dr. W&mdash;ms &s;everal mi&s;takes in his Critical Di&s;&s;ertation on I&s;aiah vii. 13, 14, 15, 16; yet he hath not thought proper to acknowledge one of them, though he has laboured to di&s;prove &s;everal. Some of the principal arguments which the Doctor has advanced in favour of his hypothe&s;is are con&s;idered in the following pages.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to a defence of my remarks, it may be nece&s;&s;ary for me to examine a very im|portant que&s;tion concerning the interpretation of Scripture prophecies, notwith&s;tanding that Dr. W&mdash;ms apprehends the &s;ame to be <Q>&s;ufficiently <HI>and even</HI> conclu&s;ively decided already;</Q> viz. Whether any "allegorical meanings, and double &s;en&s;es of "Scripture prophecies are to be allowed?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="128"><Q>It is impo&s;&s;ible (&s;ays the Dr.) to determine when any prophecy is fulfilled, if it has more than one &s;ingle &s;en&s;e. If it has two (&s;ays he) it may have two hundred, and all of them equally ju&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>For the confirmation of this &s;entiment, he refers me to Dr. George Ben&s;on's preface to the fir&s;t volume of his paraphra&s;e and notes on St. Paul's Epi&s;tles, and to Dr. Sykes's Connexion of natural and revealed Religion, page 217, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e I have examined with as much care, I be|lieve, as is nece&s;&s;ary, and find, that the third objection to Dr. George Ben&s;on's hypothe&s;is, quoted even in his own Introduction, p. xxxiv. obliges him to make &s;uch large conce&s;&s;ions concerning types and figures, that&mdash;notwith&s;tanding his great zeal again&s;t double fen&s;es, his denying of them &s;eems a mere di&s;agree|ment in terms, and not in effect, from the general received opinion.</P>
<P>In his an&s;wer to the &s;aid objection, he allows, p. xxxv. <Q>That, wherever the <HI>law</HI> or the <HI>Prophets</HI> have declared, that the rites and ceremonies of <HI>the Mo&s;aic con&s;titution</HI> were intended to point out a moral obligation, or to prefigure the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> or &s;omething in the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, there that moral intention, or prophetic prefiguration, is the one, true &s;en&s;e of the text, &amp;c.</Q> See the Doctor's an&s;wer at length in p. xxxv.</P>
<P>Here he plainly allows of a direct application, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to the antitype; which he calls <Q>the
<PB N="5" REF="129">
one true &s;en&s;e of the text.</Q> &mdash;But how (as a rea|&s;onable man) he can po&s;&s;ibly avoid acknowledging the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of this his conce&s;&s;ion, I leave all candid readers to judge: for if there is an allegorical &s;en&s;e alluding to the antitype (which he calls "a <HI>moral intention</HI> or <HI>prophetic prefiguration</HI>") there mu&s;t certainly be, likewi&s;e, a <HI>literal &s;en&s;e</HI> ap|plicable <HI>to the type it&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed the Doctor has in that place refined his argument to &s;o &s;mall a thread, that it becomes almo&s;t imperceptible.</P>
<P>The next objection quoted by Dr. Ben&s;on, is as follows. &mdash; Object. IV. <Q>Are not many pa&s;|&s;ages in the New Te&s;tament taken from the Old Te&s;tament, and u&s;ed in a quite different &s;en&s;e from what they have, as they &s;tand in the original writer? and mu&s;t not the&s;e be called double &s;en&s;es of the words of &s;acred Scripture?</Q></P>
<P>To this the Doctor an&s;wers, &mdash; <Q>It is acknowledged, that our Lord, and his Apo&s;tles and Evangeli&s;ts, have taken &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages from the Old Te&s;tament; and u&s;ed them in a very different &s;en&s;e from what they have, as connected with the place from whence they were taken.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But that will not prove a double &s;en&s;e of the words. I may quote a pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil, Herodotus</HI> or <HI>Livy,</HI> to expre&s;s my pre&s;ent meaning, and in quite another &s;en&s;e from what it has in tho&s;e antient authors. But that will not
<PB N="6" REF="130">
prove that tho&s;e antient authors intended their words &s;hould be under&s;tood in two &s;en&s;es. In the original intention they had only one meaning. In <HI>my accommodation of them,</HI> they have only one meaning. And though the &s;ame words may have different ideas affixed to them; and be u&s;ed, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;peakers, or writers, in various &s;en&s;es; yet that does not prove that, in the original in|tention, they had more than one &s;ignification.</Q></P>
<P>Now I readily allow, that Dr. Ben&s;on's idea of <HI>an accommodation</HI> is certainly true in &s;uch ca&s;es as he has &s;uppo&s;ed, viz. in quotations from <HI>Homer or Virgil, &amp;c.</HI> <Q>To expre&s;s a pre&s;ent meaning in quite another &s;en&s;e from what it has in tho&s;e antient authors.</Q> And I as readily a&s;&s;ent to a part of Dr. W&mdash;ms quotation in page 41 of his Critical Di&s;&s;ertation from a very learned author, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. GREGORY SHARPE.&mdash;See his &s;econd argument in Defence of Chri&s;tianity taken from the ancient prophecies, page 349.</P>
<P>The &s;entence which immediately follows the above extract, ought by no means to be omitted when the author's &s;entiments on this head are quoted, viz.</P>
<P><Q>But indeed to an attentive mind the difference will appear very great between the citations from prophane authors and the prophets.</Q></P></NOTE> viz. that when <Q>pa&s;&s;ages in the Grecian poets are cited, or alluded to, in the writings of the New,</Q> or Old
<PB N="7" REF="131">
"Te&s;tament," the &s;ame <Q>are not to be con&s;idered as prophecies.</Q> For indeed they cannot other|wi&s;e be e&s;teemed than as <Q>a mere accommodation of phra&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>But when the <HI>word of the Lord by his prophets,</HI> or (as St. Matthew warily expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf) <Q>that which was <HI>&s;poken of the Lord</HI> by <HI>the prophet,</HI></Q> is cited by an evangeli&s;t, and declared <HI>to be fulfilled;</HI> the idea of "a <HI>mere accommodation</HI>" becomes highly improper, not only in a grammatical, but al&s;o in a religious &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Therefore, in an&s;wer to all that has been &s;aid in favour of <HI>accommodations,</HI> I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the <HI>fulfilling</HI> of proverbs and phra&s;es, or of quotations from poets and hi&s;torians, by <HI>a &s;imilarity of circum|&s;tances,</HI> is &s;o widely different from <HI>the fulfilling of a prophecy,</HI> that the true meaning of the word <HI>fulfill,</HI> when applied to the latter, cannot ju&s;tly be a&s;certained by &s;uch a compari&s;on.</P>
<P>The word of <HI>a prophet</HI> (e&s;pecially the word of the LORD by a PROPHET) implies a <HI>foretelling</HI> or pro|mi&s;e of future things, which mu&s;t in due time be <HI>fulfilled;</HI> as <Q>all things mu&s;t <HI>be fulfilled</HI> (&s;aid our Lord) which were written in the law of Mo&s;es, and in the prophets, and in the P&s;alms concerning me.</Q> Luke xxiv. 44.</P>
<P>Therefore when we are told, that <HI>"the word which was &s;poken of the Lord by the prophet" is fulfilled,</HI> we
<PB N="8" REF="132">
cannot, either with grammatical, or religious pro|priety (as I have before ob&s;erved) under&s;tand any other <HI>fulfilling or accompli&s;hment</HI> than that which was originally intended by the holy &s;pirit to be pre|figured.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e we cannot allow, that a &s;cripture prophecy is <HI>accommodated</HI> <Q>to a particular &s;en&s;e, to which it originally had no reference<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 40. Crit. Di&s;&s;ert.</NOTE>,</Q> unle&s;s we allow likewi&s;e that &s;uch <HI>an accommodation</HI> is ab&s;olutely a <HI>perver&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>primary</HI> &s;en&s;e of the prophet: for readers would not only be thereby perplexed and mi&s;led with re&s;pect to the true accompli&s;hment ori|ginally and &s;ingly intended by the words of the pro|phet &s;o cited, but would al&s;o be naturally led to con|ceive, that the matters, related by the evangeli&s;t, were intentionally prefigured or foretold thereby, which would be a deception of no &s;mall di&s;credit to the evangeli&s;t, if his compari&s;on had really no other relation to the prophecy than that <Q><HI>of a</HI> &s;imiliarity of circum&s;tances.</Q></P>
<P>So that &s;uch a mi&s;application of &s;cripture pro|phecy cannot otherwi&s;e be con&s;idered than as a de|ception leading to a <HI>double mi&s;con&s;truction</HI> as above; which would be as little &s;uitable to the te&s;timony of an evangeli&s;t <HI>"by way of illu&s;tration,"</HI> as to the original &s;en&s;e of the prophet, whatever Dr. Ben&s;on
<PB N="9" REF="133">
may think of it, or Dr. W&mdash;ms either. See his Remarks, p. 40.</P>
<P>If all this be duly con&s;idered, I think no one can rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that an evangeli&s;t would attempt to <HI>mi&s;lead</HI> his readers by declaring a prophecy to be accompli&s;hed <HI>or fulfilled</HI> in <Q>a particular &s;en&s;e to which it <HI>originally had no reference.</HI></Q> See Cri|tical Di&s;&s;ert. p. 40.</P>
<P>Dr. Ben&s;on in page xxii. of his introduction in|forms us, that <Q>if the iid and xvith P&s;alms can be &s;hown quite throughout to agree to king David, then they ought to be interpreted of him. But if (as &s;ome judicious per&s;ons have thought) there be in them &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, which are not applicable to king David, then they &s;hould be interpreted wholly concerning the Me&s;&s;iah; to whom they do, in every part, very well agree.</Q></P>
<P>Now I am of the &s;ame opinion with Dr. Ben&s;on that the&s;e two P&s;alms are undoubtedly to be inter|preted of the Me&s;&s;iah, and I do not at all contend for the application of them to David.</P>
<P>I only object, therefore, to the Doctor's rule of interpretation, which he has applied to the &s;aid P&s;alms; becau&s;e I think it will be liable, in a great variety of applications, to mi&s;lead and perplex tho&s;e per&s;ons, who may happen to adopt it.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance; the lxxiid P&s;alm, of which he &s;peaks in the &s;ame page, is undoubtedly a prophecy of Chri&s;t's kingdom, as Dr. Ben&s;on interprets it; yet
<PB N="10" REF="134">
his rule &s;eems to lead him into a real difficulty con|cerning it; becau&s;e he is thereby obliged to deny the lea&s;t reference to king Solomon; when it plainly appears by the title of the P&s;alm (<GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>"To So|lomon"</HI>) that the p&s;almi&s;t ab&s;olutely addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf <HI>to Solomon,</HI> who in the beginning of his reign was manife&s;tly a type of the &s;piritual Solomon or Shiloh (<GAP DESC="foreign"> or <GAP DESC="foreign">) the prince <HI>of "peace</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"> I&s;aiah ix.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Indeed the Doctor's rule can by no means be ad|mitted, if we con&s;ider the nature and general &s;tyle of prophetical writings, and the abrupt tran&s;itions fre|quently found therein; of which I have given am|ple and undeniable proofs from the viith, viiith, and ixth chapters of I&s;aiah. See the &s;econd part of my remarks on the Critical Di&s;&s;ertation.</P>
<P>The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, and many others of the &s;ame kind, very much confirm what I have wrote (Part II. p. 23) concerning the pa&s;&s;age quoted by St. Matthew from Ho&s;ea; (viz. <Q>out of Egypt have I called my &s;on</Q>)
and, I think, mu&s;t prove to all con&s;iderate people, that Dr. Sykes (the other cham|pion for accommodations to whom Dr. W&mdash;ms has referred me) has been much too precipitate in decla|ring (pages 230 and 231 of his Connexion of natural and revealed Religion) <Q>that the prophet (in this text) is not &s;peaking of <HI>any future event:</HI></Q> and that the
<PB N="11" REF="135">
term <Q>fulfilled, cannot imply a prophecy of our Sa|viour's going into Egypt, or coming from thence:</Q> &amp;c.&mdash;The &s;ame ob&s;ervation may with ju&s;tice be made concerning Dr. W&mdash;ms, who boldly a&s;ks (page 40.)&mdash;"How can it be &s;aid, that any thing is ful|filled "which was not &s;poken to be fulfilled? as in chap. ii. 15. (Matthew) <Q>or not &s;poken by a pro|phet, in the &s;en&s;e in which it is cited by an evan|geli&s;t?</Q> Al&s;o the Doctor declares in page 39&mdash; concerning this pa&s;&s;age, that it <Q>could not be ful|filled <HI>when the</HI> child Je&s;us <HI>came out of</HI> Egypt.</Q></P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions I mu&s;t ob&s;erve in the fir&s;t place, that they cannot by any means be proved. And &s;econdly, that it is mo&s;t rea&s;onable to believe this text of Ho&s;ea to be a prophecy of Chri&s;t; be|cau&s;e the &s;tyle and con&s;truction of the &s;entence it&s;elf is &s;o peculiarly adapted to the <HI>&s;ingle per&s;on</HI> of the Me&s;&s;iah, that the Seventy have thought them&s;elves obliged to leave the <HI>literal &s;en&s;e</HI> of the original, in order to render it more &s;uitable in their tran&s;lation to <HI>the people</HI> of I&s;rael: all which I have before parti|cularly noted.</P>
<P>But there are &s;till other rea&s;ons to be given in fa|vour of it.</P>
<P>Though the people of I&s;rael are here &s;poken of in &s;uch a manner, that Dr. W&mdash;ms thinks he has &s;ufficient rea&s;on to intitle it <Q>a declaration of an event long pa&s;t;</Q> yet St. Matthew expre&s;ly quotes it as a prophecy, viz. as <Q>that which was &s;poken of
<PB N="12" REF="136">
the Lord by the prophet;</Q> which expre&s;&s;ion could not with any propriety be u&s;ed, if the words of the prophet were merely an <HI>hi&s;torical relation;</HI> for they could not, in that ca&s;e, be &s;aid to be <Q>&s;poken of the Lord.</Q></P>
<P>Thus it plainly appears, that there is not the lea&s;t room to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>an accommodation.</HI></P>
<P>So that, notwith&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid by Dr. Sykes, Dr. G. Ben&s;on, and Dr. W&mdash;ms, again&s;t double &s;en&s;es, it mu&s;t unavoidably be allowed, that the <Q><HI>declaration (in this place)</HI> of an event long pa&s;t,</Q> prefigured <HI>an event to come;</HI> and con&s;e|quently that <HI>this &s;ingle text</HI> affords an indi&s;putable proof of the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of double &s;en&s;es in the Scrip|tures.</P>
<P>Though &s;ome Chri&s;tians have run into errors by turning every thing into allegory, double &s;en&s;es, pa|rables and types, whether they were really &s;o or not; yet this is no ju&s;t argument why we &s;hould indi&s;crimi|nately reject all con&s;tructions of this kind.</P>
<P>And though I contend for double &s;en&s;es in &s;ome ca&s;es, yet I am as aver&s;e to an unnece&s;&s;ary multipli|cation of them as Dr. W&mdash;ms can be; and there|fore reject and prote&s;t again&s;t the Doctor's propo&s;i|tion (in page of his MS reply to my remarks) that if a prophecy <Q>has two <HI>(&s;en&s;es)</HI> it may have two hundred; and all of them equally ju&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>fulfilling of a prophecy</HI> (as I have before ob|&s;erved) mu&s;t mean the <HI>only true accompli&s;hment, or
<PB N="13" REF="137">
completion of it;</HI> &s;o that it cannot ju&s;tly be extended, or applied to any further circum&s;tances, than tho&s;e particularly and originally intended; therefore, when an evangeli&s;t has declared a prophecy <HI>to be fulfilled,</HI> though he may have convinced us that the prophet's words referred to are capable of bearing <HI>a double &s;en&s;e</HI> (viz. one literal, and one allegorical or prefi|gurative, which he him&s;elf points out) yet, at the &s;ame time, he manife&s;tly excludes the other 198 &s;en&s;es, notwith&s;tanding that Dr. W&mdash;ms thinks <HI>"all of them equally ju&s;t."</HI> For after a declaration is made <HI>(of indi&s;putable authority)</HI> that a prophecy <HI>is fulfilled,</HI> it would be, not only impertinent, but pre&s;umptuous, to look for <HI>a further accompli&s;h|ment.</HI></P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary, however, for me to ob&s;erve, that the <HI>fulfilling of &s;ome particular prophecies</HI> includes a con&s;iderable length of time, as well as a variety of circum&s;tances and places.</P>
<P>Of this, I propo&s;e to give one remarkable in|&s;tance, which will afford me, at the &s;ame time, a proper opportunity of &s;peaking more particularly to Dr. Sykes.</P>
<P>The Doctor, in his Connexion of natural and re|vealed Religion, chap. x. p. 229, affirms, <Q>that our Saviour, and his apo&s;tles, applied the term <HI>to ful|fill,</HI> when there was only a &s;imilitude of circum|&s;tances: and (that) they cited the words of the Old Te&s;tament, and made u&s;e of that term, upon
<PB N="14" REF="138">
the application of them, where they did not de|&s;ign to expre&s;s the <HI>accompli&s;hment</HI> of a <HI>prophecy.</HI></Q> <Q>You have (&s;ays the Doctor) <HI>an in&s;tance very clear</HI> in Matthew xiii. 14, 15. where our Saviour gives the rea&s;on why he &s;poke to the people in parables: <HI>becau&s;e,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>they &s;eeing &s;ee not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they under|&s;tand.</HI> And in them is <HI>fulfilled the prophecy of E&s;aias, which &s;aith, by hearing ye &s;hall hear, and &s;hall not under&s;tand, and &s;eeing ye &s;hall &s;ee, and &s;hall not perceive. For this peoples heart is</HI> waxed gro&s;s, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have clo&s;ed: le&s;t at any time they &s;hould &s;ee with their eyes and hear with their ears, and &s;hould under&s;tand with their hearts, and &s;hould be converted, and I &s;hould heal them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Our Saviour (&s;ays the Doctor) applies the&s;e words to the Jews in Judea, and St. Paul, many years afterwards, applies the very &s;ame prophecy to the Jews at Rome.</Q> <Q>This &s;hews (continues he) that, though the term <HI>fulfill,</HI> when applied to an <HI>event foretold, does</HI> &s;ignify the accompli&s;hment of <HI>a real prophecy;</HI> yet it was u&s;ed in ca&s;es where there was no accompli&s;hment of a prediction, but only a <HI>&s;imilitude of circum|&s;tances;</HI> and con&s;equently, the application of the words of a prophet to a certain particular event, by w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h they are &s;aid to <HI>be fulfilled,</HI> does not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a double &s;en&s;e of prophecy,
<PB N="15" REF="139">
or that &s;uch a <HI>particular event</HI> was foretold:</Q> <Q>But the real meaning of the word mu&s;t be deter|mined by other circum&s;tances; &s;uch as, whether the prophet is &s;peaking of a future event or not, or, in &s;hort, by tho&s;e means by which one knows whether the words are prophetic or not.</Q></P>
<P>But before all this rea&s;oning of Dr. Sykes be admitted, we ought carefully to examine the foun|dation or proof on which it is built.</P>
<P>This he calls <HI>"an in&s;tance very clear;"</HI> but I hope to convince my readers, that it is <HI>no in&s;tance at all of this matter,</HI> and con&s;equently that the Doc|tor's conclu&s;ion thereupon is unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Were not the Jews one people, and de&s;cended from the &s;ame &s;tock, whether they lived at Jeru&s;a|lem or Rome?</P>
<P>If this be granted (and I think the mo&s;t zealous advocates for Dr. Sykes will not deny it) it mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be allowed likewi&s;e, that this remarkable prophecy of E&s;aias concerning them, (viz. <Q>by hearing ye &s;hall hear, and &s;hall not under&s;tand,</Q> &amp;c. I&s;aiah vi. 10.) was <HI>manife&s;tly fulfilled</HI> when the Jews rejected the doctrine of Chri&s;t, whether preached by him&s;elf at one time, or by his apo&s;tles at other different times.</P>
<P>So I think I may &s;afely conclude that the two <HI>dif|ferent applications</HI> quoted by Dr. Sykes of this &s;ame prophecy, were not occa&s;ioned, as he &s;uppo&s;es, by a
<PB N="16" REF="140">
mere <HI>"&s;imilitude of circum&s;tances,"</HI> but by a <HI>direct accompli&s;hment</HI> of <HI>the prediction</HI> in <HI>both ca&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Now as this example cannot any longer &s;erve the cau&s;e in favour of which it was quoted by Dr. Sykes; I hope it will not be e&s;teemed an im|proper example of a very <HI>different argument,</HI> and therefore I &s;hall beg leave to claim it on my &s;ide of the que&s;tion, as <HI>"an in&s;tance very clear"</HI> of the truth of the ob&s;ervation which I made above, viz. that the <HI>fulfilling</HI> of &s;ome particular prophecies includes a con&s;iderable length of time, as well as a variety of circum&s;tances and places.</P>
<P>However, I mu&s;t not leave this text without coming to a further explanation with Dr. W&mdash;ms concerning it, becau&s;e he has brought a very heavy accu&s;ation again&s;t me concerning the parallel account given by St. Mark, chap. iv. 11, 12.</P>
<P>He charges me with <HI>reflecting</HI> <Q>&s;everely on the character of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us,</Q> by &s;aying, <Q>that he taught in parables, le&s;t they &s;hould under&s;tand and be &s;aved.</Q> "Our Saviour" (&s;ays the Doctor) <Q>gave a very different rea&s;on for his conduct; and Mr. S&mdash; &s;hould have rendered the pa&s;&s;age Mark iv. 12. agreeable to the evangeli&s;t's words in the 33d ver&s;e of the &s;ame chapter: <GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;hould be there tran&s;lated <HI>if per|adventure,</HI> as it is in 2d. Timothy ii. 25.</Q> &mdash; However, I am not at all con&s;cious (I thank God)
<PB N="17" REF="141">
of having in the lea&s;t re&s;pect offended again&s;t the character of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord.</P>
<P>Neither do I know of any <HI>&s;evere reflection</HI> in this ca&s;e, except the Doctor's <HI>own charge</HI> again&s;t my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Whatever &s;en&s;e the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> may bear in other places, yet in the parallel places of St. Matthew and Mark above-mentioned, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be con&s;trued <HI>"le&s;t"</HI>&mdash;or to that effect: for, as the &s;en&s;e of the context mu&s;t confirm the true meaning of any particular word, it will be found, upon ex|amination, that the Doctor's &s;en&s;e of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages cannot po&s;&s;ibly be admitted.</P>
<P>The words of Chri&s;t, according to the te&s;timony of both the&s;e evangeli&s;ts, point out the material di&s;tinction, which he then made between tho&s;e that were true believers, and the reprobate Jews, whom our Lord called, "them that are without" (&s;ee Mark iv. 11.) to the former it was <Q>given to know the my&s;tery of the kingdom of God,</Q> Matthew xiii. 11. Mark iv. 11. But to the latter, &s;ays St. Matthew, <HI>"it is not given."</HI></P>
<P>Now this nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinction is entirely lo&s;t by Dr. W&mdash;ms's interpretation, becau&s;e there is no &s;uch di&s;tinction made in the 33d ver&s;e of the fourth chapter of St. Mark, the &s;en&s;e of which the Doctor propo&s;es to adopt; for the evangeli&s;t is there &s;peaking of Chri&s;t's preaching in general to the whole multitude, including tho&s;e to whom <Q>it
<PB N="18" REF="142">
was given to know,</Q> as well as tho&s;e to whom it was "not given;" and this is certain, becau&s;e in the very next ver&s;e (the 34th) we read, that afterwards, <Q><HI>when they were alone,</HI> he expounded all things to his di&s;ciples.</Q></P>
<P>Now it might very well be &s;aid of Chri&s;t's preaching to the whole multitude of good and bad together, that <Q>with many &s;uch parables &s;pake he the word unto them, as they <HI>were able to hear it;</HI></Q> becau&s;e Chri&s;t ob&s;erved this &s;ame method, even when he taught his di&s;ciples alone; and at la&s;t de|clared to them, &s;oon before his pa&s;&s;ion, <Q>I have yet many things to &s;ay unto you, but ye <HI>cannot bear them now.</HI></Q> John xvi. 12.</P>
<P>But when the <HI>reprobate</HI> Jews are &s;poken of <HI>&s;eparately and di&s;tinctly</HI> from tho&s;e to <HI>whom it</HI> was <HI>"given to know,"</HI> it cannot be under&s;tood that the word was &s;poken <Q><HI>unto them as they</HI> were able to hear it.</Q></P>
<P>Becau&s;e, it is apparent, that they <HI>were never able to hear it, or bear it</HI>&mdash;according to the true &s;en&s;e of the&s;e phra&s;es; which imply &s;uch a comprehen&s;ion of the doctrine, as may produce an a&s;&s;ent or belief; otherwi&s;e the prophecy of I&s;aiah, which Chri&s;t then referred to, could not have been fulfilled. <Q>Be|cau&s;e <HI>&s;eeing, they &s;ee not</HI> (&s;aid our Lord) and hearing, <HI>they hear not,</HI> neither do <HI>they under|&s;tand.</HI></Q> (Which is very different from being &s;poken to, as Dr. W&mdash;ms would have it, <Q>as they
<PB N="19" REF="143">
<HI>were able to</HI> hear.</Q>) <Q>And in them (continued our Lord) is fulfilled the prophecy of E&s;aias, which &s;aith, by hearing ye &s;hall hear, and <HI>&s;hall not under&s;tand,</HI> and &s;eeing, ye &s;hall &s;ee, and <HI>&s;hall not perceive.</HI></Q> (Therefore it is plain that St. Mark's expre&s;&s;ion, chap. iv. 33. cannot be applied to the&s;e, when di&s;tinctly &s;poken of from the re&s;t of the congregation.) "For this people's heart" (&s;aid I&s;aiah) <Q>is waxed gro&s;s, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes <HI>they have clo&s;ed, le&s;t</HI> at any time they &s;hould &s;ee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and &s;hould under&s;tand with their heart, and &s;hould be converted, and I &s;hould heal them</Q> (&s;aid our Lord).

Martin likewi&s;e explains this to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. <Q>Ce&s;t a dire que Dieu &s;e cache a ceux qui l'ayant pu trouver ne &s;e &s;ont pas mis en etat de le chercher, &amp; qu'il livre a leurs prejuges &amp; a leur tenebres ceux qui ont ferme les yeux a la verit&eacute;.</Q></P></NOTE> in their condem|nation,
<PB N="20" REF="144">
they having rendered them&s;elves unworthy of a clearer revelation by their unwillingne&s;s to be converted. They rejected &s;uch evidence as Chri&s;t was plea&s;ed to give them, which would have been amply &s;ufficient, had they not <HI>not wilfully &s;hut their eyes again&s;t it;</HI> for St. John &s;ays, chap. iii. 19. <Q>this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their works are evil.</Q></P>
<P>Therefore they were <HI>ju&s;tly e&s;teemed unworthy</HI> <Q>to know the my&s;teries of the kingdom of heaven.</Q> For, "who&s;oever hath" (&s;aid our Lord) <Q>to him &s;hall be given, and he &s;hall have more abundance: but who&s;oever <HI>hath not,</HI> from him <HI>&s;hall be taken away,</HI> even <HI>that he hath.</HI> THEREFORE, <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;peak I to them in parables, becau&s;e they &s;eeing, &s;ee not,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The words <GAP DESC="foreign">, "THEREFORE," plainly refer to the foregoing &s;entence, viz. <Q><HI>but who&s;oever</HI> hath not &mdash; <HI>from him</HI> &s;hall be taken away,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that the &s;cope and tenor of the argument would be entirely de&s;troyed if Dr. W&mdash;ms's &s;en&s;e of the parallel pa&s;&s;age in St. Mark were to be admitted.&mdash; For Chri&s;t plainly intended to &s;hew, that the unbe|lieving Jews would lo&s;e even what little knowledge they had; &s;o far would they be from under&s;tanding or receiving his parables. And the event plainly proved this; for they fell from bad to wor&s;e, untill
<PB N="21" REF="145">
the total de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, when <HI>the abo|mination of de&s;olation</HI> (&s;poken of by Daniel) was accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>St. Mark does not, indeed, expre&s;s the very words of the prophet I&s;aiah, nor mention the quotation made of them by Chri&s;t, but he plainly delivers the <HI>full &s;en&s;e of them,</HI> as they were really <HI>fulfilled</HI> in the unbelieving Jews, viz.</P>
<P>"Unto you" (&s;aid Chri&s;t to his di&s;ciples) <Q>it is given to know the my&s;tery of the kingdom of God, but unto <HI>them that are without,</HI> all the&s;e things are done in parables: THAT &s;eeing they may &s;ee, <HI>and not perceive,</HI> and hearing they may hear, and <HI>not under&s;tand,</HI> LEST at any time they &s;hould be converted, and their &s;ins &s;hould be forgiven them.</Q></P>
<P>The particle <GAP DESC="foreign"> ("THAT") followed by verbs in the &s;ubjunctive mood (<GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c.) cannot po&s;&s;ibly be made &s;en&s;e of, if the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> ("LEST") is tran&s;lated,&mdash;<HI>"if peradventure";</HI> becau&s;e the negative <GAP DESC="foreign"> (viz. <GAP DESC="foreign">, and <GAP DESC="foreign">, "may <HI>not &s;ee,</HI> and <HI>may not under&s;tand</HI>") ab&s;olutely leads to a different &s;en&s;e from that propo&s;ed by Dr. W&mdash;ms.</P>
<P>So that it is mo&s;t rea&s;onable to conclude with Dr. Hammond, that the&s;e words <GAP DESC="foreign"> <Q>that &s;eeing,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>note the obduration of the I&s;ra|elites, which fell on them from God's de&s;ertion; as a puni&s;hment of their not making u&s;e of the
<PB N="22" REF="146">
talents, which he had given them, and &s;o this ver&s;e is an&s;werable, and parallel to Matthew xiii. 15, or the end of that place in I&s;aiah recited, and &s;et down at large in St. Matthew; but here &mdash;(and &s;o al&s;o in Luke viii. 10. and John xii. 40.) <HI>epitomized and &s;ummed up, <GAP DESC="foreign">, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;ee,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The word <GAP DESC="foreign">, therefore, cannot in ei|ther of the&s;e places be con&s;trued <HI>"if peradventure,"</HI> without de&s;troying the propriety of our Lord's quota|tion from I&s;aiah, delivered at length by St. Mat|thew, and <HI>epitomized by St. Mark</HI> as above; for the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, in the original prophecy, is properly rendered <GAP DESC="foreign"> in the Syriac, and LEST in the Engli&s;h tran&s;lations, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly bear any other &s;en&s;e agreeable to the context; becau&s;e the prophet plainly foretold, that the Jews would <HI>wilfully &s;hut their eyes</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) <Q>LEST they &s;hould &s;ee with their eyes.</Q></P>
<P>Now, men do not u&s;ually <HI>&s;hut their eyes</HI> in order <HI>to &s;ee therewith,</HI> or (according to Dr. W&mdash;ms's interpretation of <GAP DESC="foreign">) <HI>"if peradventure"</HI> they may &s;ee with their eyes; but rather, that they may <HI>not &s;ee,</HI> or, according to the propriety of the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation of <GAP DESC="foreign">, <Q>LEST <HI>they &s;hould &s;ee</HI> with their eyes,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The clo&s;ing of the eyes, in this place, is indeed a mere figurative expre&s;&s;ion for the in&s;en&s;ibility and wicked ob&s;tinacy of the Jews; yet the &s;ame rea&s;on|ing
<PB N="23" REF="147">
holds good, notwith&s;tanding this con&s;ideration, and &s;ufficiently proves, that the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> mu&s;t be con&s;trued <HI>negatively,</HI> and not, as Dr. W&mdash;ms propo&s;es, "if <HI>peradventure.</HI>"</P>
<P>By this example we learn that &s;ome parables were not only difficult to tho&s;e reprobate unbelievers, whom St. Mark calls <HI>"them that are without,"</HI> but al&s;o, even to the true di&s;ciples them&s;elves; who, by mi&s;under&s;tanding the parable of the &s;ower, and by de&s;iring an explanation of it (&s;ee 10th ver&s;e) occa&s;ioned this remarkable an&s;wer of our Lord, the purport of which is recorded in the two texts con|&s;idered above.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, there were very many ca&s;es, wherein the teaching by parables and types was (not only the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t prudent, but al&s;o) the &s;horte&s;t and cleare&s;t method of conveying a true idea of the propo&s;ed doctrine, as being very &s;uitable to the genius and cu&s;toms of the Ea&s;tern nations in general, and of the Jews in particular; and al&s;o becau&s;e the types and figures them&s;elves would make a very deep impre&s;&s;ion on the memory, and by their well known characters clearly illu&s;trate the allegorical meaning.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e now to recon&s;ider the principal &s;ubject of my remarks, viz. the prophecy of I&s;aiah con|cerning the birth of Immanuel.</P>
<P>Dr. W&mdash;ms has a&s;&s;erted (page 44.) <Q>that the evangeli&s;t only alludes to the pa&s;&s;age in I&s;aiah,
<PB N="24" REF="148">
becau&s;e it was <HI>remarkably &s;uitable</HI> to the matter which he was relating.</Q></P>
<P>This occa&s;ioned my que&s;tion to the Doctor, viz. <Q>If <GAP DESC="foreign"> does not &s;ignify a virgin, in what &s;en&s;e can the text be e&s;teemed <HI>remarkably &s;uitable</HI> to the miraculous conception <HI>of a virgin</HI> by the Holy Gho&s;t? And in what manner could the <HI>accom|modation of it</HI> to that &s;ingular event a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;acred hi&s;torian (as he &s;uppo&s;es) <HI>by way of illu&s;tration?</HI></Q> See Part I. page 39.</P>
<P>I afterwards ob&s;erve, that the Doctor <Q>has taken great pains to make the text <HI>remarkably un&s;uitable,</HI> by in&s;inuating that <GAP DESC="foreign"> the YOUNG WOMAN (as he con&s;trues it) &s;poken of in the text, was &s;o far from being a <HI>virgin,</HI> that &s;he was <HI>with child,</HI> even at the time when &s;he was pointed at (as he devi&s;es in p. 31.) by the prophet.</Q></P>
<P>To which the Doctor replies, <Q>had St. Matthew alluded to the birth of this child, it would have been <HI>very un&s;uitable.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now this conce&s;&s;ion is &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e, becau&s;e the Doctor's in&s;inuation, that the evangeli&s;t alluded only <HI>"to the name Immanuel,"</HI> and not to the other circum&s;tances related by the prophet, mu&s;t appear entirely groundle&s;s, when we con&s;ider the words of St. Matthew.</P>
<P>For though the evangeli&s;t interpreted the name <HI>Immanuel,</HI> yet this does not prove, that he referred
<PB N="25" REF="149">
merely to <HI>this name,</HI> but rather, that no other per&s;on but the Me&s;&s;iah him&s;elf could properly be intitled, <HI>"God with us;"</HI> and con&s;equently that he e&s;teemed the words of I&s;aiah to be really a prophecy, and &s;uch a one as could not be <HI>fulfilled,</HI> except in Chri&s;t alone, who was truly <HI>"God with us."</HI> But farther&mdash;The evangeli&s;t's manner of introducing the quotation very clearly &s;hews, that <HI>this name</HI> was not the only thing he intended to allude to.</P>
<P>For he &s;ays&mdash; <Q>NOW ALL THIS WAS DONE&mdash; (<GAP DESC="foreign">) that it might <HI>be fulfilled</HI> which was &s;poken <HI>of the Lord by the prophet,</HI> behold A VIRGIN <HI>&s;hall be with child,</HI> and &s;hall <HI>bring forth a &s;on,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The words "ALL THIS WAS DONE" mu&s;t refer to the relation before given, concerning the miraculous conception of <HI>the virgin Mary</HI> by the Holy Gho&s;t, and therefore the prophecy of I&s;aiah, that A VIRGIN &s;hould <HI>conceive,</HI> and <HI>bear a &s;on, was &s;uitable,</HI> not in <HI>the name only</HI> (as Doctor W&mdash;ms has in&s;inuated) <HI>but</HI> in <HI>the whole quotation.</HI></P>
<P>Another objection is made, <Q>that the birth of a child from a virgin is a fact of &s;uch a nature, as not to admit of proof.</Q> "It is a fact" (&s;ays the Doctor) <Q><HI>which in the</HI> very nature of it can|not be a &s;ign to <HI>any</HI> per&s;on <HI>but the mother.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the Scriptures inform us that <HI>this &s;ign</HI> was clearly proved (i. e. the wonderful event that <HI>a
<PB N="26" REF="150">
virgin had conceived,</HI> was known with ab&s;olute cer|tainty) even <HI>before</HI> the birth of the Me&s;&s;iah; and this, not merely by the te&s;timony <HI>of the mother,</HI> but by other very &s;ufficient authorities; which rendered the &s;ign as apparent and indubitable, as any other &s;ign that was ever given, even the mo&s;t &s;elf-evi|dent.</P>
<P>For after the angel Gabriel had revealed to the virgin Mary, that &s;he (although a virgin) &s;hould "conceive and bring forth a &s;on;" St. Luke i. 31.) the &s;ame thing was confirmed to her by her cou&s;in Elizabeth in the hill country of Judea.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;&s;ed is &s;he that believed" (&s;aid Elizabeth filled with the Holy Gho&s;t) <Q>for there &s;hall be a per|formance of tho&s;e things which were told her from the Lord.</Q> Luke i. 45.</P>
<P>See the whole &s;alutation, and the te&s;timony of John the Bapti&s;t, though him&s;elf at that time only a babe in the womb; which clearly proves that the ab&s;olute knowledge of the fact was not confined to the <HI>virgin mother alone.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards an angel was &s;ent from God to pre|vent Jo&s;eph from putting away his e&s;pou&s;ed wife on account of her being with child; and the angel in|formed him before the time, that &s;he &s;hould <Q>bring forth a &s;on;</Q> and, that he might the more effec|tually convince him of his wife's purity and virtue, he a&s;&s;ured him, &s;aying, <Q>that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> (Matt. i. 20.)</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="151">Therefore, though <Q>the birth of a child from a virgin</Q> is by Dr. W&mdash;ms e&s;teemed <Q>a fact of &s;uch a nature as not to admit of proof;</Q> yet no|thing is impo&s;&s;ible with God, who was plea&s;ed to give the&s;e indubitable proofs of the long promi&s;ed &s;ign, even whil&s;t the child Je&s;us was in the womb, which mu&s;t entirely obviate the Doctor's objection, that <HI>"this cannot be a &s;ign to any per&s;on but the mother."</HI></P>
<P>In the fulne&s;s of time the &s;ign was manife&s;ted in the mo&s;t extraordinary manner.</P>
<P>An angel, accompanied with a multitude of the heavenly ho&s;t, proclaimed the wonderful birth to the &s;hepherds in the field; and a &s;tar pointed out to the ea&s;tern &s;trangers the place where the young child lay.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly this wonderful circum&s;tance, that A VIRGIN HAD BROUGHT FORTH A SON, would, in a little time, be as well known to <HI>the hou&s;e of David,</HI> as the&s;e miraculous manife&s;tations and confirmations of the &s;aid &s;upernatural birth; e&s;pecially as the family of Jo&s;eph, the ble&s;&s;ed virgin's hu&s;band, was <HI>the chief branch of that royal &s;tock,</HI> lineally de&s;cended from Zorobabel, and &s;o from the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another difficulty with Dr. W&mdash;ms. <Q>I cannot perceive (&s;ays he) <HI>what event</HI> the birth of Immanuel could be a &s;ign of, unle&s;s it <HI>could be a &s;ign of it&s;elf?</HI></Q></P>
<P>But is it really po&s;&s;ible, that Dr. W&mdash;ms <Q>can|not perceive,</Q> that the miraculous birth of the
<PB N="28" REF="152">
true Immanuel was a &s;ign of &s;omething more than that event it&s;elf?</P>
<P>Was it not a &s;ign to all tho&s;e, who then waited for <HI>"the con&s;olation and redemption of I&s;rael,"</HI> (Luke ii. 25.) that the <HI>kingdom of God</HI> was <HI>nigh at hand?</HI> (Matthew xii. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"But if I ca&s;t out devils by the Spirit of God, then <HI>the kingdom</HI> of <HI>God is come</HI> unto you."</NOTE> Luke x. 9.11. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"And &s;ay unto them, the kingdom of God <HI>is come</HI> nigh unto you.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding be ye &s;ure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you."</NOTE>.)</P>
<P>Was it not a &s;ign to <HI>Jo&s;eph, and others of the hou&s;e of David,</HI> that a child, &s;o born, mu&s;t be the long promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah of the <HI>&s;eed of David,</HI> to whom <HI>the kingdom was to be re&s;tored,</HI> and in whom (according to I&s;aiah's promi&s;e to his cotemporaries of <HI>the hou&s;e of David</HI>) it was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed for ever? See I&s;aiah ix. 6, 7. 2 Sam. vii. 16.</P>
<P>But, I find, it is in vain that I urge to Dr. W&mdash;ms the accompli&s;hment of the &s;everal pro|phecies concerning the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <Q>kingdom of David</Q> in Chri&s;t; for the Doctor &s;till &s;eems to per&s;i&s;t in his former notion that Nathaniel <Q>la|boured under a mi&s;take</Q> in calling Chri&s;t <Q>king of I&s;rael.</Q></P>
<P>He hopes to evade the point by alledging, that <Q>not only Nathaniel and the di&s;ciples, but the whole Jewi&s;h nation did actually labour under a
<PB N="29" REF="153">
great mi&s;take about <HI>the nature</HI> of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>Thus he would lead me to a very different que&s;|tion; but I am aware, that though the di&s;ciples did, for &s;ome time, <HI>"labour under a mi&s;take,"</HI> as the Doctor ob&s;erves, concerning <Q>the nature of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom;</Q> yet there was <HI>not the lea&s;t mi&s;take,</HI> in tho&s;e who truly believed, concerning the main point in que&s;tion, viz. whether or not the Me&s;&s;iah <HI>was really a king?</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding that our Lord rejected all the temporal authority of a worldly king, and declared, that his kingdom was not of this world, he was neverthele&s;s really a king, <HI>"king of I&s;rael"</HI> (as Nathaniel called him) and king of Judah, or (which is the &s;ame thing) <HI>"king of the Jews;"</HI> for even Pilate him&s;elf &s;eemed convinced of Chri&s;t's ju&s;t right to the title of <HI>king,</HI> though, like a thorough-paced time &s;erver, he preferred his own temporal in|tere&s;t to all other con&s;iderations, and delivered up THE KING OF KINGS (Rev. xvii. 14.) to be &s;lain, know|ing him to be A KING; for his an&s;wer to the chief prie&s;ts, concerning the title intended to be affixed to the cro&s;s, plainly &s;hews, that he was con&s;cious of this.</P>
<P>Dr. W&mdash;ms charges me with having <Q>brought a va&s;t number of texts to prove, not (my) a&s;&s;ertion, that Je&s;us was ever called the king of Judah, but the truth of (his) a&s;&s;ertion,</Q> &amp;c. concerning the
<PB N="30" REF="154">
mi&s;take of Nathaniel. And he &s;ays, <Q>this will be evident to every one who con&s;ults the pa&s;&s;ages cited by me.</Q></P>
<P>But if the Doctor will plea&s;e once more to con|&s;ult the pa&s;&s;ages him&s;elf, he will find, that &s;everal among them are prophecies which were ab&s;olutely fulfilled in our Lord Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Therefore, I hope, he will not venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the prophets likewi&s;e <HI>"laboured under a mi&s;take,"</HI> when they proclaimed the&s;e titles of the glorious Me&s;&s;iah; or that the di&s;ciples, and all other Chri&s;|tians even to this day &s;till "labour <HI>under a mi&s;take</HI>" in applying them to Chri&s;t, in whom alone they were, or could be fulfilled.</P>
<P><Q>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; &s;hout O daughter of Jeru&s;alem: behold THY KING <HI>cometh unto thee:</HI></Q> the prophet then proceeds to de&s;cribe <HI>this coming of</HI> THE KING <HI>of Zion and Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &s;o as exactly to corre&s;pond with the evangeli&s;t's account (Luke xix. 37, 38.) of Chri&s;t's publick entry into Jeru&s;alem, when <Q>the whole multitude of the di&s;|ciples began to rejoice and prai&s;e God with a loud voice, for all the <HI>mighty works</HI> that they had &s;een: &s;aying, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed be</HI> THE KING <HI>that cometh</HI> in the <HI>name of the Lord,</HI></Q> &amp;c. For he was certainly <HI>a king</HI> even when he rode upon the a&s;s, which is proved by the continuation of Zechariah's prophecy (ix. 9.) whereby he points out the character and appearance of <HI>the king of Zion and Jeru&s;alem</HI> mentioned in the
<PB N="31" REF="155">
beginning of the &s;ame ver&s;e; "he is ju&s;t" (&s;aid the prophet) <Q>and having &s;alvation, lowly, and riding upon an a&s;s, and upon a colt the foal of an a&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>So the prophet Micah declared, that out of <HI>Beth|lehem Ephratah</HI> &s;hould <Q>he come forth that is to be <HI>ruler in I&s;rael,</HI> who&s;e goings forth have been from of old from everla&s;ting.</Q> (chap. v. 2.)</P>
<P>The event proved the truth of the prophet's words, as well as of the evangeli&s;t's citation (Matt. ii. 5 and 6.) for the holy one that was born at <HI>Bethlehem</HI> was afterwards undoubtedly <HI>"ruler in I&s;rael,"</HI> be|fore the di&s;&s;olution of that people from an united na|tion: of which (be&s;ides the power of his teaching and his mighty works) his publick entry into Jeru|&s;alem, and the authority &s;hewn by him in clearing the temple, are remarkable proofs.</P>
<P>That Chri&s;t was "a <HI>ruler in I&s;rael</HI>" is implied in the preceding words of the &s;ame prophet (Micah v. 1.) <Q>they &s;hall <HI>&s;mite the judge of I&s;rael</HI> with a rod upon the cheek.</Q> A <HI>ruler</HI> and a <HI>judge</HI> are &s;yno|nymous terms; and it is certain that Chri&s;t pro|nounced <HI>judgment</HI> again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael</HI> for their impeni|tence and want of faith&mdash;condemning them (with re&s;pect to their <HI>temporal e&s;tate</HI>) to a horrid de&s;truction and de&s;olation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Matthew, chap. xxiv.</NOTE>: and as all this was mo&s;t punctu|ally fulfilled <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Jo&s;ephus's account of the Jewi&s;h War.</NOTE> upon them, it is certain likewi&s;e, that
<PB N="32" REF="156">
the &s;ame <HI>"judge of I&s;rael"</HI> whom they &s;mote upon the cheek, will <HI>one day judge them,</HI> al&s;o, in their <HI>eter|nal &s;tate,</HI> as well as all their unhappy de&s;cendants who per&s;i&s;t in the &s;ame unbelief.</P>
<P>If the&s;e prophecies were really <HI>fulfilled</HI> in Je&s;us, they mo&s;t certainly prove, that the Me&s;&s;iah was (as he ever will be) A KING, and con&s;equently that his di&s;ciples were not mi&s;taken in calling him &s;o, how|&s;oever they might mi&s;under&s;tand the <HI>nature</HI> of his kingdom.</P>
<P>Therefore the Doctor's reply upon this point can|not well be e&s;teemed a proof of any thing more than of his own great unwillingne&s;s to acknowledge, that he him&s;elf (in&s;tead of Nathaniel) <HI>labours under a mi&s;take.</HI></P>
<P>Another remarkable excu&s;e, which the Doctor has offered in behalf of his hypothe&s;is, de&s;erves par|ticular notice.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to my remarks on Canticles vi. 8. (con|cerning the particular di&s;tinction there made of vir|gins from queens and concubines) the Doctor replies, that <Q><HI>Hebrew poetry is not &s;o well under&s;tood</HI> as to enable (me) to determine that <GAP DESC="foreign"> in Canticles vi. 8. is not u&s;ed in &s;tead of <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>for the &s;ake of metre.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This unexpected turn of thought may, perhaps, be e&s;teemed ingenious, but it is far from &s;atisfactory; for if criticks were allowed to &s;ub&s;titute the &s;en&s;e of one word for another, whenever their arguments are
<PB N="33" REF="157">
reduced to that nece&s;&s;ity, it would be but a vain ta&s;k to di&s;pute with them; and a confu&s;ion of lan|guage, like that of the builders of Babel, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ucceed their perver&s;ion of words.</P>
<P>In Engli&s;h poetry the Doctor may produce as many in&s;tances of &s;uch &s;ub&s;titutions as he plea&s;es, and he may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that I &s;hall never think it worth my while to attempt a confutation of them.</P>
<P>But when &s;uch refined critici&s;ms are applied to any part of Holy Scripture, I think, they ought not by any means to be admitted, unle&s;s the authors of them &s;hall be able to prove, that it is more ju&s;tifi|able to adapt the Scriptures to our own private opi|nions, than our opinions to the Scriptures.</P>
