<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY work on the &s;ubject of Topography, founded on au|thentic records, and executed with accuracy and fidelity, has a natural claim upon the patronage of that particular place or di&s;trict, of which it treats. The following may in &s;ome degree boa&s;t of more exten&s;ive preten&s;ions, two con&s;iderations making an Hi&s;tory of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne of general and national im|portance: its &s;ituation, not far from the borders of Scotland, which rendered it one of the principal frontier towns during the ho&s;tilities with the &s;i&s;ter kingdom; and, &s;ince that unhappy time, its exten&s;ive coal trade.</P>
<P>The olde&s;t printed account of that place, is, a &s;mall book in quarto, con&s;i&s;ting of thirty-four pages, and intitled, "Chorogra|phia, or a Survey of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, &amp;c. Newca&s;tle printed by S. B. 1649. S. P. D. dilectis Burgen&s;ibus et probis Hominibus Novi Ca&s;tri &s;uper Tinam. W. G."</P>
<P>The la&s;t letters &s;tand for the initials of William Grey, of whom I have not been able to recover any particulars. &mdash; The Greys of Backworth in Northumberland are &s;aid to be of the &s;ame family. This work, an imperfect outline, but which is extremely &s;carce, was reprinted in the Harleian Mi&s;cellanies, vol. iii. in 1745, with &s;ome additional remarks.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5">Another &s;mall quarto volume on the &s;ame &s;ubject, very rarely to be met with, is intitled, "England's Greivance di&s;covered in relation to the Coal Trade; with the map of the river of Tyne, and &s;ituation of the town and corporation of Newca&s;tle, &amp;c. by Ralph Gardiner of Chriton (Chirton) in the county of Northum|berland, Gent. London, 1655." It is dedicated to the Lord Protector Cromwell, con&s;i&s;ts of two hundred and eleven pages, and is ornamented with the heads of &s;everal kings and queens of England. The author appears to have been a mo&s;t pointed enemy to the magi&s;trates of Newca&s;tle <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>The mayor and corporation of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, in their an&s;wer to the com|plaint of Ralph Gardiner to the committee appointed for trade, &amp;c. 1653 (a MS. which I have read), expre&s;sly &s;ay that that writer "broke the goale of Newca&s;tle la&s;t &s;ummer, being there impri&s;oned for divers great &s;ums of money, and again impri&s;oned at the &s;uit of the &s;heriff of the &s;aid town;" and to this they attribute his malicious charge.</P>
<P>The MS. Life of Alderman Barnes, which I &s;hall often have occa&s;ion to cite, in a note, p. 420, informs us, that, "upon &s;ome methods agreed on for reformation of man|ners in the town, according to that clau&s;e in the charter, which impowers them to make be laws, there was one Gardiner writ a malicious invective again&s;t the government of Newca&s;tle; but he got his reward, being afterwards at York hanged for coyning."</P>
<P>Chirton, where he lived, is a village ea&s;t of Newca&s;tle, near the town of Sheilds. "He was," &s;ays Bourne, "a bitter enemy to this town, and did all the mi&s;chief to it that lay in his power, as appears in every page of his book, in which are numbers of fal&s;ities."</P></NOTE>. From each of the&s;e curious tracts I have adopted in the &s;ub&s;equent collections what|ever I thought worthy of being pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>With regard to MS. authorities, I &s;hall con&s;tantly refer my readers to the great national repo&s;itories&mdash;the Heralds' and Aug|mentation Offices, the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, the Rolls' Chapel, and the Tower of London.</P>
<P>The Bodleian library at Oxford, the public library, and tho&s;e of Trinity and Bennet Colleges in the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, were open to my in&s;pection.</P>
<P>I found a very copious &s;ource of unedited materials in the archives of the corporation of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Permi&s;&s;ion was granted to me in the mo&s;t liberal manner by the late John Baker, E&s;q. alderman of that town, during his la&s;t mayoralty, to in&s;pect all the records, with liberty at the &s;ame time to make what extracts I thought proper.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="6">My honoured patron, the Duke of Northumberland, conde|&s;cended to allow me the liberty of peru&s;ing and extracting what|ever I found to my purpo&s;e from many of the valuable records of his illu&s;trious hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I was indulged with the free u&s;e of a MS. collection, intitled, "An Ab&s;tract in order of Time of the Charters and other Records concerning the Town of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne."</P>
<P>It appears to have belonged to &s;ome former recorder or town-clerk, but comes no lower down than the fifth year of the reign of King Charles the Fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I cite this under the name of "the Aubone MS." it having belonged to the late Mr. Aubone, &s;ecretary to the Trinity-Hou&s;e. A copy of it, taken by Mr. Aubone's permi&s;&s;ion, is pre&s;erved in the library of John Era&s;mus Blackett, E&s;q. alderman of New|ca&s;tle <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">That gentleman u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavours, but without &s;ucce&s;s, to obtain for me a &s;ight of the Milbank MS. &s;o often quoted by Bourne.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have derived very con&s;iderable information from a MS. in folio, which I call "the Murray MS." having received the loan of it from a gentleman <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Mr. George Parker.</NOTE> to whom it was bequeathed by the late Mr. James Murray, attorney at law <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Mr. Murray &s;erved his clerk&s;hip to Mr. Ord, attorney at law in Newca&s;tle.&mdash;He was afterwards in the town-clerk's office.&mdash;The MS. devolved to him on the death of Mr. Ord. I have &s;ome rea&s;ons for thinking that the greate&s;t part of this collection was made by Sir Robert Shaftoe, on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> recorder of Newca&s;tle. Mr. Murray died in 1779. See In&s;criptions in St. Andrew's church-yard, in the following work.</NOTE>. It is written in various hands, and evidently at different periods; &s;o that probably it has al&s;o been the property of &s;ome former recorder or town-clerk.</P>
<P>I was favoured with the peru&s;al of a curious MS. by the pre|&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, John Medley, E&s;q. alderman of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne. It is intitled, "A Catalogue of all the Mayors and She|riffs of his Maje&s;ty's Towne and Countye of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, with their Coats of Armes and the Reignes of the &s;everal
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
Kinges and Queens of this Land, with certain Briefs of Chronicles that happened in their &s;everal Reigns &s;ince Anno Domini 1432." I call this throughout the following work "the Carr MS." as it appears to have owed its pre&s;ervation to one of that family.&mdash; The &s;ub&s;equent in&s;cription is &s;tamped in golden letters on the binding: "Robert Carre, E&s;q. St. Helen Auckland 1730;" with the family arms: viz. gules, on a chevron argent three mullets fable. This is doubtle&s;s the identical MS. mentioned by Bourne in page 121 of his Hi&s;tory of Newca&s;tle<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Introduction to the fir&s;t volume of the Archaeologia, p. 25, notes, it is &s;aid that Mr. El&s;tob, &s;on of Ralph El&s;tob, merchant at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, who was born in 1673, fellow of Univer&s;ity College, Oxford, and died rector of the united pari&s;hes of St. Swithin and St. Mary Botham in London, 1714, collected for an Hi&s;tory of New|ca&s;tle; but what is become of the MS. is not known.</P>
<P>For this collection I made every inquiry, but in vain.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have occa&s;ionally made con&s;iderable u&s;e of a MS. "Life of Ambro&s;e Barnes, merchant and &s;ometime alderman of New|ca&s;tle." It is in folio, clo&s;ely written, with a dedication to Sir Theodore Talbot. It contains &s;everal curious anecdotes; but the writer, whoever he was, appears to have been deeply tinctured both with religious and political fanatici&s;m.</P>
<P>The dedication, &s;igned with the initials M. R. is dated June 19th, 1716.</P>
<P>From Bourne's Hi&s;tory of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, a thin folio volume, which was publi&s;hed three years after the death of the author, A. D. 1736, a circum&s;tance which both apologizes and accounts for the various contradictions with which it abounds, I have &s;elected whatever I thought authentic and intere&s;ting to my &s;ubject <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Newca&s;tle Courant for November 20th, 1731, are in&s;erted Mr. Bourne's propo&s;als for publi&s;hing this work by &s;ub&s;cription: He had adverti&s;ed for materials in the &s;ame Courant for September 18th, 1731.</P>
<P>The po&s;thumous work was adverti&s;ed ibid. April 24th, 1736, to be delivered to the &s;ub&s;cribers on the 3d of May following.</P>
<P>Mr. Bourne, after a very lingering illne&s;s, died about four o'clock in the afternoon of February 16th, 1733.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="8">George Allan, E&s;q. F. S. A. of Darlington in the county of Durham, favoured me, in the mo&s;t liberal and polite manner, with the loan of &s;everal volumes of MSS. copied from original records remaining in the church of Durham, and which had been bequeathed to him by the indefatigable tran&s;criber, the Rev. Mr. Randall, late of that city, with liberty of making &s;uch ex|tracts as I &s;hould think proper. I cite the&s;e pa&s;&s;im by the title of "Randall's MSS. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Hunter of Durham, often mentioned with re&s;pect by the learned Mr. Hor&s;ley, in his Britannia Romana, tran&s;cribed a great number of records, relating to Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, from the archives of the church of Durham, (as I gather from Randall's MSS.) and &s;old a copy of Bourne's Hi&s;tory afore&s;aid, with the&s;e tran&s;cripts interleaved, to Mr. Akenhead, book&s;eller at Newca&s;tle, for five guineas, in 1740. This collection was the ground-work of Mr. Akenhead's engaging in the de&s;ign to publi&s;h an Hi&s;tory of Newca&s;tle, for which he gave out propo&s;als, not long after the above purcha&s;e. This intended work was, however, never publi&s;hed, nor could I by any means procure a &s;ight of the interleaved copy of Bourne's Hi&s;tory; but I have every rea&s;on to think that I found tran&s;cripts of the &s;ame records in Randall's MSS. Mr. Akenhead's propo&s;als for printing by &s;ub&s;cription a Hi&s;tory of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne in two volumes in quarto, were publi&s;hed in the Newca&s;tle Journal &s;ome time in the year 1750.</P></NOTE>"</P>
<P>I &s;elected &s;ome very intere&s;ting materials from the MS. collec|tions of the late George Grey, of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, E&s;q. barri&s;ter at law: all of which, together with his library, had been &s;old by his executors to Mr. Robert Harri&s;on, formerly of that town, of whom they were purcha&s;ed (with &s;everal notes, extracts, and references to books, concerning the &s;ame place, which he him&s;elf had made and collected in the cour&s;e of his very exten&s;ive reading), for the u&s;e of the following work.</P>
<P>Vicinity and other circum&s;tances once tempted me to hope that, in the cour&s;e of my progre&s;s in it, I &s;hould have profited much by his judicious ob&s;ervations; but from the circum&s;tance of his removing to the &s;outh of England, and of my leaving the north before his return, my expectations on that head were en|tirely fru&s;trated.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="9">Sir Matthew White Ridley, Bart. governor of the Merchants' Company, indulged me in the polite&s;t manner with the liberty of in&s;pecting the records of that &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Alexander Adams, E&s;q. &s;teward of the Ho&s;tmen's Company, did me a &s;imilar favour with re&s;pect to tho&s;e of that fraternity.</P>
<P>I am indebted to John Era&s;mus Blackett, E&s;q. for the loan of a curious MS. collection of pedigrees, &amp;c. which formerly be|longed to the Calverley family, and to their late mo&s;t re&s;pectable repre&s;entative, Sir Walter Blackett, Bart.</P>
<P>I owe the peru&s;al of Dr. Elli&s;on's MS. collections, with many other attentions, to the kindne&s;s of his grand&s;on the Rev. Natha|niel Elli&s;on, M. A. vicar of Bolam in Northumberland, and lec|turer of St. Andrew's in Newca&s;tle upon Tyne.</P>
<P>The late George Stephen&s;on, E&s;q. procured me leave to in&s;pect the old books and other records of the Trinity-Hou&s;e of that town.</P>
<P>Liberty to examine and collect notes from the pari&s;h regi&s;ters was granted me in the mo&s;t friendly manner by the &s;everal clergy and keepers of the regi&s;ters in Newca&s;tle and Gate&s;head<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">I mu&s;t not omit to mention that a collection of neat drawings of monuments, arms, &amp;c. in the &s;everal churches of Newca&s;tle, was purcha&s;ed of Mr. Lambert, formerly clerk to the recorder of Newca&s;tle, for the u&s;e of this work; and had the copies of the in&s;crip|tions on the monuments been as accurate as they ought to have been, they would have anticipated a great deal of my mo&s;t ungrateful labour.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I owe acknowledgments for permi&s;&s;ion to in&s;pect &s;everal antient MSS. curious deeds, &amp;c. to Thomas A&s;tle, E&s;q. F. R. S. and S. A. keeper of the records in the Tower of London; to John Topham, E&s;q. F. R. S. and S. A. of the State Paper Office; to Craven Ord, E&s;q. F. R. S. and S. A. of the Exchequer; to John Caley, E&s;q. keeper of the records in the Augmentation Office.</P>
<P>For various communications in the cour&s;e of the following work, I &s;tand indebted to Charles Coombe, M. D. F. R. S. and S. A.; to the Rev. Mr. Penneck, F. R. S.; the Rev. Mr.
<PB N="ix" REF="10">
Southcote, and the Rev. Mr. A&s;cough, of the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum; to Mrs Adair, formerly Mi&s;s Shaftoe, of Benwell Lodge, in the county of Northumberland; to Hugh Hornby, E&s;q. alder|man of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne; to John David&s;on, E&s;q. clerk of the peace for the county of Northumberland; to Nathaniel Clayton, E&s;q. town-clerk, and Nathaniel Pun&s;hon, E&s;q. under-&s;heriff of Newca&s;tle; to Jonathan Airey, E&s;q. to Thomas David&s;on, E&s;q. to Ja&s;per Harri&s;on, E&s;q. to Mr. George Ander&s;on, architect; to the late Mr. Davi&s;on, and to Mr. Rutter, attorneys at law in Newca&s;tle; to Robert Page, E&s;q. deputy comptroller of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e of that place; to Mr. Ralph Beilby, and Mr. Richard Fi&s;her, of the &s;ame town.</P>
<P>To the &s;everal &s;tewards of the incorporated companies of Newca&s;tle, I was obliged for the liberty of &s;earching in their re&s;pective archives for their ordinaries and other antient writings<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><P>I &s;hall ju&s;t barely mention, that the late Rev. Mr. James Murray, a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter in Newca&s;tle, undertook, &s;ome time before his death, to compile a hi&s;tory of that town; but, having no means of procuring any other information on the &s;ubject than was to be obtained from printed books, his de&s;ign came to nothing.</P>
<P>From motives of delicacy I contented my&s;elf with this account of his MS. from tho&s;e who peru&s;ed it, declining, for very obvious rea&s;on, to read a line of it my&s;elf.</P>
<P>There is a brief hi&s;tory of Newca&s;tle included in Wallis's Hi&s;tory of Northumberland, and in Hutchin&s;on's View of the &s;ame county.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>After pleading, in excu&s;e for the rough and unpoli&s;hed &s;tyle of the following collections, the rudene&s;s of my materials, deduced from the records of barbarous ages, corrupted in many places by the ignorance and inattention of former tran|&s;cribers, I &s;hall conclude in the language of the learned pre|late, Dr. White Kennet:</P>
<P>"If the pre&s;ent age be too much immer&s;ed in plea&s;ures to take any reli&s;h, or to make any u&s;e of the&s;e di&s;coveries, I then appeal to po&s;terity: for I believe the times will come,
<PB N="x" REF="11">
when per&s;ons of better inclination will ari&s;e, who will be glad to find any collections of this nature, and to &s;upply the defects and carry on the continuation of it.&mdash;I am under no concern to vindicate it from the &s;lights and ridicule that may be ca&s;t upon it by idle, witty (his Lord&s;hip might have added, ignorant) people, who think all hi&s;tory to be &s;craps, and all antiquity to be ru&s;t and rubbi&s;h." Or in that of the great Camden, in the preface to the Latin edition of his Britannia:</P>
<P>"Si qui &s;int, qui in urbe &s;ua ho&s;pites, in patria &s;ua pere|grini, et cognitione &s;emper pueri e&s;&s;e velint, &s;ibi per me pla|ceant, &s;ibi dormiant, non ego illis haec con&s;crip&s;i, non illis vigilavi."</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ANCIENT FORTIFICATIONS, STREETS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The olde&s;t <HI>Plan</HI> I have &s;een of Newca&s;tle is that in Speed's Map of Northumber|land. See a fac-&s;imile copy of this in a corner of the new plan that accompanies this work. It was de&s;cribed by William Mathew, who is mentioned in an inqui&s;ition 18th James I. in the account of the ca&s;tle, about the year 1610.</P>
<P>A. D. 1723, a Plan of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, dedicated to Matthew Feather&s;tone|haugh, mayor, the aldermen, &s;heriff, and common council of that town, was publi&s;hed in two &s;heets, with twenty-&s;ix views of publick buildings, by James Corbridge.</P>
<P>The plan prefixed to Bourne's Hi&s;tory, publi&s;hed in 1736, is without any engraver's name, and &s;eems only a copy of the above, with additions and improvements.</P>
<P>Gough, in his Briti&s;h Topography, Vol. II. p. 57, tells us, he was informed, that "a very correct plan (of Newca&s;tle) was taken &s;oon after the rebellion, by order, and at the expence, of the late Duke of Cumberland, and is now in the hands of Mr. Thomp&s;on, who drew it." I inquired of Mr. Thomp&s;on's &s;on, but could neither learn of him whether ever &s;uch a plan had been taken, nor into who&s;e hands it had fallen.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t correct plan of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, and Gate&s;head, taken from an actual &s;urvey, fini&s;hed in the year 1770, engraved in two &s;heets by J. Ellis, was publi&s;hed by Charles Hutton, mathematician.</P>
<P>Thore&s;by, in his Ducatus Leoden&s;is, p. 497, mentions a <HI>Pro&s;pect</HI> he had of Newca&s;tle, drawn by Mr. William Lodge, of Leeds, who was born in 1649, and died 1689.</P>
<P>A &s;outh pro&s;pect of the town of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, taken from the top of Gate&s;head-Church-&s;teeple, by Samuel Buck, was engraved and publi&s;hed in the month of April, 1724.</P>
<P>A large north-ea&s;t view of Newca&s;tle was publi&s;hed by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, 1715.</P>
<P>Grey, in his Chorographia, p. 27, tells us, that Camden makes Newca&s;tle upon Tyne 22 grad. 30 min. longitude&mdash;54 grad. 57 min. latitude: and that Hues makes it 23 grad. 10 min. longitude&mdash;55 grad. 20 min. latitude.</P>
<P>According to Dr. Hutton's plan, it &s;tands preci&s;ely in 55 degrees of north latitude, and about 1&deg; 17&prime; longitude we&s;t from London.</P></NOTE>, CHURCHES, MONASTERIES, BRIDGES, AND OTHER PUBLICK EDIFICES, IN NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE.</HEAD>
<P>HARDYNG, in his Chronicle, informs us that Newca&s;tle upon Tyne was inclo&s;ed with a wall during the reign of William Rufus <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>See Hi&s;tory of Newca&s;tle, as a borough town, under that reign: His words are;
<Q><L>"The towne to builde, and walle as did append,</L>
<L>He gave theim ground and golde ful great to &s;pend,</L>
<L><HI>To builde it well, and wall it all aboute, &amp;c.</HI>"</L></Q>
That part of the wall near St. Andrew's-Church, which is of a more antique fa&s;hion than the re&s;t, may perhaps be a &s;pecimen of the earlie&s;t and original walls of Newca&s;tle&mdash;it extends from New-Gate to Ever-Tower.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="21">In a charter of King John to that town, dated January 28th, 1216, expre&s;s mention occurs of the walls thereof<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;tory of the Merchants Adventurers.&mdash;The words are; "Et quod nullus eorum qui fuerit infra gildam &s;uam mercatoriam placitet extra muros Novi Ca&s;tri."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a grant from the King to the Black-Friars of Newca&s;tle, dated Sept. 18th, 1280, the we&s;t part of the pre&s;ent wall of that town, near the hou&s;e of that order, is called the New-Wall <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>To have a pa&s;&s;age into their garden.&mdash;The words are; "Quod per medium novum murum circumagentem villam predictam, quem per medium gardini predictorum fratrum fieri oportebit, &amp;c." See afterwards in the account of that hou&s;e. The wall appears to have been fini&s;hed a year or two afterwards, by the &s;ub&s;equent extract from the Aubone MS. "A. D. 1283, 11th Ed. I. Upon a writ of ad quod damnum, inquiry was made before the mayor and bailiffs of Newca&s;tle, whether there were, between the town-wall and the hou&s;e of the friars preachers there, a place called the King's-Place. And it was found that there was &s;uch a place, purcha&s;ed the la&s;t year of the i&s;&s;ues and profits of the murage, upon part of which the wall was built, and part left for nece&s;&s;ary carriages unto it, which is called the void place, and is nece&s;&s;ary for the defence thereof."</P>
<P>Among the writings pre&s;erved in the hutch, or common trea&s;ury of Newca&s;tle, A. D. 1565, was one intitled, "A grant for building the walls of the town." The original is now lo&s;t, and the date has not been tran&s;mitted.</P></NOTE>.</P>

Hereupon he was raun&s;omed for a great &s;um, and returning home he beganne to make a waulle on the ripe of Tyne ryver, from Sand-Hille to Pandon-Gate, and beyond that to the tower agayne the Augu&s;tine-Freres."&mdash;He afterwards &s;ays, the walls were not en|tirely fini&s;hed till Edward the Third's time.&mdash;Indeed he &s;peaks merely from the report of others, who plainly appear to have known nothing of the matter.&mdash;He adds, "The &s;trength and magnificens of the waulling of this towne far pa&s;&s;ith al the waulles of the cities of England, and mo&s;t of the townes of Europe."</P>

<P>October 21&s;t, 1695, there is an order for entirely taking off the above &s;alaries.</P>
<P>Sept. 17, 1745, there is an order of common council to build up all the gates leading into the town, except Sand-Gate, New-Gate, the gates upon Tyne-Bridge, and the Water-Gates, &s;igned by Matthew Ridley, mayor.&mdash;This was done for the &s;ecurity of the town again&s;t the rebels.</P></NOTE>, and round towers in them, which were wont to be defended, in times of ho&s;tility with the Scots, by the particular wards appropriated to them.</P>
<P>There was a turret, or tower, fifty-two yards to the &s;outh of the Clo&s;e-Gate, adjoining to the river Tyne <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">There is an order of common council, March 22d, 1648, that "the peeres at the Clo&s;e-Gate &s;hould be repaired."</NOTE>&mdash;part of it is &s;till remaining. &mdash;It has been made u&s;e of, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, as a meeting-hou&s;e for the companies of hou&s;e-carpenters and &s;ail-makers.</P>

From the Clo&s;e-Gate there are an hundred and forty &s;teps, on the top of the wall, as it mounts a very &s;teep hill to White-Friar-Tower, at the di&s;tance of &s;ixty-nine yards and one foot.&mdash;The common name of the&s;e, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Break-Neck-Stairs, is of very obvious etymology.</P>

<P>John de Denton was a bailiff of Newca&s;tle in 1339. This tower may probably have been built by him, or &s;ome of his family, who might al&s;o have had great property in the lane called Denton-Chare.</P>
<P>Ralph Nevil, Lord of Raby, was created Earl of We&s;tmoreland, in the 21&s;t year of the reign of Richard the Second.</P>

<P>Bourne &s;uppo&s;es this po&s;tern in the wall to have been an outlet to the (White) Friars, that they might walk to the Forth and the neighbouring fields, and that it might be of u&s;e to the ca&s;tle in times of ho&s;tility with the Scots. He imagines al&s;o this to have been the gate out at which the town&s;men in the reign of Edward III. to the number of three hun|dred valiant men, i&s;&s;ued, and came &s;uddenly, in the night, upon a great army of the Scots, which lay in the we&s;t part of the town; and rai&s;ed and put them to flight, taking Earl Murray pri&s;oner in his tent, &amp;c.

His account proceeds as follows: "From Sand-Gate to Clo&s;e Gate&mdash;From Sand-Gate to the Broad-Chare, 143 yards 2 feet.&mdash;From the Broad-Chair to Trinity-Chair, 68 yards.&mdash;From Trinity-Chair to Sand-Hill-Corner, 198 yards.&mdash;From Sand-Hill-Corner to the Bridge-End, 132 yards.&mdash;From the Bridge-End to the Mayor's Hou&s;e, 252 yards.&mdash;And from the Mayor's Hou&s;e to the Clo&s;e-Gate, 117 yards and 2 feet,&mdash;making the circumference, in all, two miles, two hundred and ninety-three yards, and two feet.</P>
<P>Bourne makes the whole circumference two miles and an hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix yards.</P>
<P>According to Hutton's plan, the circuit of the wall now &s;tanding, from the Clo&s;e-Gate to Sand-Gate, is 2740 yards, or one mile and an half, and an hundred yards.</P>
<P>A pa&s;&s;age, leading from the Sand-Hill to the Key-Side, &s;till retains the name of the Water-Gate.&mdash;Mention of it occurs in the common-council books, Augu&s;t 24th, 1649, where it is called "the Windowes-Gate." Leland, who vi&s;ited Newca&s;tle in the time of Henry VIII. tells us, there were "a &s;trong wardyd gate at Gate&s;hed, a &s;trong warde and towre on Tyne-Bridge, and a gate at the Bridge-End"&mdash;<HI>i. e.</HI> that end next the town.</P>

<P>THE proofs that a Roman bridge <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><P>Bourne tells us, "The bridge is of great antiquity, undoubtedly as old as the times of the Romans: there mu&s;t have been a communication between this and the other &s;ide of the river, and therefore there was a nece&s;&s;ity for it."&mdash;The ingenious Mr. Hor&s;ley, p. 104, &s;ays, "I think there are &s;ome certain and vi&s;ible remains of a military way on Gate&s;head-Fell, pointing directly towards the part where, I &s;uppo&s;e, the &s;tation has been at New|ca&s;tle, and coming, as I apprehend, from Che&s;ter-le-Street. Dr. Hunter a&s;&s;ured me he had al&s;o ob&s;erved vi&s;ible remains of &s;uch a way. And it is the common opinion that there has been a military way from Che&s;ter-le-Street to Newca&s;tle. This way tends towards the place where the bridge now is. There mu&s;t then have been a bridge in the Roman times over the river Tyne, near the place where the pre&s;ent bridge &s;tands." Thus far from Bourne.&mdash;Hor&s;ley's words are, p. 399, Romana Britannia&mdash;"That Dr. Hunter in|formed him, that "he had ob&s;erved a military way going off from Watling-Street, near Binche&s;ter, which he (Dr. H.) &s;uppo&s;ed went to Che&s;ter-on-the-Street, between Durham and Newca&s;tle; he traced it to Bran&s;peth-Park, but could find it no farther." He adds, p. 391, "That the name of Che&s;ter-on-the-Street does not a little confirm the opinion, that there has been a Roman &s;ettlement there of &s;ome kind or other, and that a military way has pa&s;&s;ed from Newca&s;tle to it."&mdash;He adds farther on this &s;ubject, p. 451, "The gardener at Cou&s;ins'-Hou&s;e told me, that he had ob&s;erved, when he wrought thereabouts, the military way from Newca&s;tle to Che&s;ter-le-&s;treet, and that it lay to the we&s;t of the pre|&s;ent highway, through the Fell. And Dr. Hunter was po&s;itive that he had ob&s;erved the &s;ame way upon this Fell: as al&s;o &s;ome remaining tracks of a via vicinalis beyond Che&s;ter, between Binche&s;ter and Brancepeth-Ca&s;tle (as I remember) pointing towards Che&s;ter, which he therefore concluded mu&s;t have gone that way."</P>

<P>An ancient Itinerary, di&s;covered &s;ince they wrote, &s;eems to confirm their account beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><P>The Itinerary of Richard of Cirence&s;ter, di&s;covered and fir&s;t printed by Mr. Bertram in Sweden. We trace, on the ancient map, delineated in this very valuable acqui&s;ition to Engli&s;h antiquartes, the Roman great road, leading &s;traight from Cataract, in York|&s;hire, to Binche&s;ter, in the county of Durham, where it branches out into two different iters, one of which &s;tretches towards Falkirk, in Scotland, by way of Ebche&s;ter, Cor|bridge, &amp;c. while the other, pa&s;&s;ing through Che&s;ter-in-the-Street, terminates at the Roman wall at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne.</P>
<P>At Corbridge the remains of a Roman bridge are &s;till vi&s;ible.</P>

Some have &s;uppo&s;ed that there was one of tho&s;e inns at Gate&s;head, called, at that time, from the &s;ign of a goat's head, "Caprae Caput."&mdash;But &s;ee account of "Gate&s;head."</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="62">The Emperor Aelius Hadrian, who connected the forts erected by Agricola, by rai&s;ing the great vallum, that in this part of the i&s;land extended nearly from &s;ea to &s;ea, was probably the fir&s;t that built a bridge at this place; from which circum&s;tance, the &s;tation it led to from the Roman road was afterwards called "Pons Aelii," an appellation plainly derived, as were tho&s;e of others of his publick works, from the name of his own family <NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot"><P>"Thus," &s;ays Pennant, "Jeru&s;alem was &s;tyled Aelia Capitolina," and the games he in&s;tituted at Pincum in Mae&s;ia, "Aeliana Pincen&s;ia."

<P>Two coins appear to have been &s;truck upon the building of two bridges by this Em|peror: one is doubtle&s;s to be referred to that at Rome: may not the other have been in|tended to commemorate the work we are now con&s;idering? One of the bridges marked on the&s;e coins has &s;even, the other five arches. The Tyber being a very incon&s;iderable river, when compared with the Tyne, we mu&s;t therefore claim that with &s;even arches&mdash; e&s;pecially as we find a view of the Pons Aelius at Rome in Pirane&s;i's Collection, without the modern ornaments, where it is repre&s;ented as con&s;i&s;ting of exactly five arches. See Vaillant, tom. i. p. 68, where, &s;peaking of the coins of Hadrian, he thus de&s;cribes one of them: "Sine epigraphe Pons Aelius cum &s;eptem fornicibus &s;ub eo plurimae figurae;"&mdash; and the other, p. 194, as follows: "Sine epigraphe Pons Aelius cum quinque forni|cibus."&mdash;(Edition of Paris, 1692, quarto.)</P>

This, I imagine, has been for the building of keys, and e&s;pecially for the repairing of the Bi&s;hop's part of the bridge, which is a further proof that the bridge, which was the original one, was wood."

<P>About the year 1559, the very marvellous event related by Bourne, and others, concerning Mr. Ander&s;on's ring, dropped by accident over this bridge, as he was fingering it, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened. The part of the &s;tory, which &s;ome have ventured to doubt the truth of, is, that this identical ring was brought back again, after &s;ome time, in a fi&s;h bought in Newca&s;tle market, by a &s;ervant of the above merchant, and mo&s;t unexpectedly re&s;tored to its owner <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>In the parchment fragment before mentioned, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;toler out of the archives of the corporation of Newca&s;tle, at the riot there in 1740, is entered, by an after in&s;ertion, an account of what is there called "Sir Francis Ander&s;on's ring," under the year 1559.</P>
<P>Yet the writer of Vox Pi&s;cis, or the Book Fi&s;h, publi&s;hed in 1627, tells us, p. 13, that this event "fell out in our memorie," to a "citizen of Newca&s;tle, who&s;e name I take to be M. Ander&s;on."&mdash;He does not mention the kind of fi&s;h in which the ring was found.</P>
<P>In Grey's Chorographia, M. Ander&s;on is &s;tyled an alderman, and the fi&s;h called a &s;almon, which, &s;ome &s;ay, is incapable of &s;wallowing any thing &s;o large as a ring. See a &s;tory &s;imilar to this in Herodotus, lib. iii. c. 41.&mdash;In Littlebury's tran&s;lation of that work, it is in vol. i. p. 272.</P>
<P>There is another of the &s;ame kind related in the Engli&s;h Morery, or Collier's Diction|ary, in verbo "Kentigern."</P>
<P>Fuller, in his Worthies, takes notice of this event, referring, in the margin, to the Vox Pi&s;cis.</P>
<P>Bourne tells us, p. 132, "This gentleman, from who&s;e finger the ring fell, was mayor of Newca&s;tle, and was ance&s;tor of the pre&s;ent Mr. Abraham Ander&s;on, merchant, on the Sand-Hill: the &s;aid Francis Ander&s;on made over his e&s;tate to his &s;on, Henry Ander&s;on, who was the father of the &s;aid Abraham's grandfather." He adds, "On the in&s;ide of the ring, ju&s;t under the &s;ignet, is the picture of a &s;almon, in commemoration of the fi&s;h and the tran&s;action; on the one &s;ide of which is the letter F. and on the other, the letter A. in commemoration of the per&s;on," calling it, at the &s;ame time, "A curio&s;ity &s;o great, that not only the whole kingdom cannot &s;hew the like of it, but the whole world be&s;ide."</P>

<P>In the MS.

<Q><L>"O ba&s;e mault,</L>
<L>Thou did&s;t the fault,</L>

<P>THIS hou&s;e, anciently con&s;i&s;ting of an ho&s;pital and chapel, was founded in the reign of Henry the Second, by one A&s;elack of Killing|howe <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><P>Bourne, p. 31.&mdash;"Ego A&s;elack de Killinghowe fundavi ho&s;pitale Sanctae Mariae Vir|ginis &amp; capellam &s;uper terram meam in Novo Ca&s;tello &s;uper Tynam et ibi po&s;ui duos fratres regulares et unum capellanum ad &s;erviendum Deo et pauperibus: reddidi meip|&s;um Deo &amp; beatae Mariae, &amp; fratribus eju&s;dem ho&s;pitalis ibidem Deo &s;ervientibus ad ho&s;|pitandum pauperes et egenos clericos &amp; peregrinos tran&s;euntes pro &s;alute animae patris mei matris meae &amp; omnium pertinentium &amp; pro &s;alute animarum omnium ho&s;pitalis benefactorum.&mdash;Lib.

<P>The words above, "&s;uper terram meam fundavi," &s;eem plainly to infer that he rai&s;ed the &s;tructure from the ground, although Bourne, on the authority of the MS. he &s;o often cites, and which he calls "Liber Cartarum," &s;tyles A&s;elack the &s;econd founder. Having found in Cambden's Britannia, a Lord Walter de Bolbeck conveying lands to the church of Winche&s;ter, A.

What Tanner, in his Notitia Mona&s;tica, has recorded concerning the different foundations of this hou&s;e, being only a tran&s;cript of Bourne's very confu&s;ed account, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow the fortune of its original.</P></NOTE>, who not only rai&s;ed the fabric, but gave the ground al&s;o upon which it was erected, and placed therein two friars regular, and

Hence a new order of religious was intro|duced, who being de&s;titute of fixed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and of con&s;equence obliged to rely on their own merits with the people, might re&s;tore re&s;pect to the mona&s;tic in&s;titution, and recover the honour of the church."&mdash;This order, one and the fir&s;t of the four, is &s;aid to have been founded by St. Dominic, a native of Cologna, in Spain, A. D. 1198. Pope Innocent III. approved it in 1215, and it was confirmed by a bull of Pope Honorius the Third, in 1216. By &s;ome they are reported to have come into England, A.

Between the village of Walker, <HI>i. e.</HI> the town by the wall, and Byker-Hill, the Wall of Severus, with its fo&s;s, are &s;till plainly di&s;tingui&s;hable: the &s;ite of the wall at pre&s;ent is covered with bru&s;h|wood and &s;tunted trees. Dr. Stukeley has pre&s;erved in his Iter Boreale a view of the appearance of the Roman Wall, between Byker-Hill Mill and Newca&s;tle, when he wrote. From this mill to the Smith's &s;hop near the fir&s;t mile-&s;tone on the Shields road, the &s;ite of the wall and hollow of the fo&s;s, running parallel with the pre&s;ent turnpike way, are yet clearly di&s;cernible.</P>

the line of the town-wall, a little to the north of the We&s;t-Gate, where Hor&s;eley &s;uppo&s;es a very &s;mall turn has been made in it, in order to come up to the north rampart of the &s;tation<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hor&s;eley thus determines the boundaries and &s;ituation of the &s;tation of Pons Aelii: "I hinted before that there was a traditionary account of the wall's pa&s;&s;ing through St. George's Porch, near the north-we&s;t corner of St. Nicholas' church. But it is certain that the line of the wall lies a little to the north of this end of the church, and I think has not touched this porch, though it comes near it. And therefore I conjecture that the wall which has pa&s;&s;ed through this porch mu&s;t have been the ea&s;t rampart of the &s;tation; for the &s;uppo&s;ition will reconcile the&s;e &s;eemingly different accounts: and if a line be erected perpendicular to that of Severus' Wall, &s;o as to pa&s;s through that porch, and be continued along the brow of the hill, at the head of the &s;ide, till it meet the line of Ha|drian's Vallum, near the ca&s;t end of Belygate, and not far from the Ca&s;tle, this line &s;eems to an&s;wer &s;o well in all re&s;pects, that I cannot much doubt its having been the ea&s;tern limits of the ancient &s;tation: for this brings the &s;tation near to the Ca&s;tle, which probably has been built a little more to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, in order to bring it nearer to the top of a &s;teep hill. And fixing the ea&s;tern boundary of the &s;tation here, leaves a plain and level area for the &s;tation it&s;elf, and without it, a de&s;cent towards the &s;outh and the river, for the town to &s;tand upon, which might extend it&s;elf to the bridge, &s;uppo&s;ing the ancient bridge to have been near the &s;ame place where the pre&s;ent one &s;tands. From which bridge the ancient town and &s;tation might probably take the name of Pons Aelii. This ea&s;tern boundary of the &s;tation mu&s;t at that time have been nearer the river than it is now; &s;ince it is certain, that the river formerly flowed farther up towards this part of the town. The po&s;ition of the ea&s;tern rampart of the &s;tation being thus determined, the other boundaries may be al&s;o defined; for the di&s;tance here between the lines of the walls &s;eems to be about 6 charms, and it is not much to be que&s;tioned, but the two walls here (as in other ca&s;es they frequently did) have fallen in with the northern and &s;outhern ramparts of the &s;tation; &s;o that the&s;e 6 chains have been the breadth of the &s;tation. And if we &s;uppo&s;e the &s;tation to have been of a middle &s;ize, we mu&s;t make it a &s;quare, and allow 6 chains for the length of it. If at this di&s;tance another line be drawn equal and parallel to the former, and between the lines of the wall, it will be the we&s;tern boundary of the &s;tation, as the two re&s;pective parts of the two walls make the northern and &s;outhern limits. And upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, a line drawn from the &s;cot of the Fle&s;h Market to Barly Gate, near the ea&s;t end of it, will be the ea&s;tern limits of the ancient &s;tation. That part of the vallum which reaches from Baily-Gate to Mr. Ord's hou&s;e, will be the &s;outhern limit, and a line drawn from hence to that part of the line of Severus' Wall, which is about 30 yards ea&s;t from the end of Ro&s;emary-Lane, mu&s;t be the we&s;tern boundary, and the part of Severus' Wall included between this and the foot of the Fle&s;h-Market, remains for the line of the northern rampart," page 133.</NOTE> at Newca&s;tle, and to get to a &s;ufficient di&s;tance from Hadrian's Vallum.</P>

From this outer wall were four gates: the great gate and three po&s;terns. On the north &s;ide of the ca&s;tle is the main gate, now called the Black-Gate. It has had two portculli&s;es, one without the gate, as may be &s;till &s;een, and another within it at a little di&s;tance from it, the ruins of which were to be &s;een a few years ago.

<P>I know not which is the hou&s;e, which, Bourne &s;ays, was anciently the county-gaol, and underneath which, he adds, "It is reported there is a vault which leads to the ca&s;tle."&mdash; "There is indeed a large door," he continues, "&s;till to be &s;een, which was perhaps the entrance into it: and Mr. George Grey, the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, told me that it was cer|tainly &s;o becau&s;e he had put down through his own &s;loot a bailiff's rod, to the very end, and could find no bottom."</P>
<P>I know not on what authority Bourne re&s;ts his information when he tells us that the ca&s;tle-gate (I &s;uppo&s;e he means the Black-Gate) was begun to be built by one George Hayroy, but was fini&s;hed by one John Pickle, who kept a tavern in it.</P></NOTE> in

<P>Lord Dacre, warden of the marches, had intere&s;ted him&s;elf in fa|vour of the priore&s;s and the claim of the abbot; but numerous prece|dents, found in the bi&s;hop's regi&s;ters, fully e&s;tabli&s;hed the ju&s;tice of the epi&s;copal preten&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>CHANCEL OF ST. NICHOLAS.</HEAD>
<P>THE holy table or altar, which in the primitive and in the late re|forming times was made of wood, in the middle corrupted times was generally compo&s;ed of &s;tone, "as more corre&s;ponding with the import of an altar, whereon the &s;acrifice of the ma&s;s was and is &s;till offered up in the Roman church <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Staveley on Churches, p. 207.</NOTE>."</P>

<HEAD>FONT.</HEAD>
<P>IN primitive times the rite of bapti&s;m was performed in rivers and fountains.

He four times &s;erved the office of mayor, in which &s;tation, in the year 1745, he rendered e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to his country; averting, by his prudence and activity, the attack meditated again&s;t this town, by the enemies of the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick, and thereby materially checking the progre&s;s of their arms. He was unanimou&s;ly elected by his fellow burge&s;&s;es to repre&s;ent them in five &s;ucce&s;&s;ive par|liaments, and retired from that &s;ituation when the declining &s;tate of his health rendered him incapable of con&s;cientiou&s;ly fulfilling the duties of it. He lived re&s;pected and beloved, and died unfeignedly lamented, April 6, 1778. Aged 66."</P>
<P>"The ba&s;e of the monument is formed by a medallion, on which the town of Newca&s;tle is repre&s;ented by a female figure, crowned with turrets, having a &s;hield by her, bearing the arms of the town; near her is an urn, from which are &s;een i&s;&s;uing &s;almon, the peculiar attribute of the river Tyne, attacked by Rebellion, who, treading on the crown and &s;ceptre (en&s;igns of royalty), bears in one hand the torch of &s;edi|tion,

in the other the &s;word of de&s;truction: in an attitude of &s;uppli|cation &s;he inclines her&s;elf towards an armed figure, who protects her with his &s;hield, and with a &s;word in his right hand re&s;i&s;ts the figure of Rebellion; on the &s;hield are repre&s;ented the arms of the family of Ridley; the helmet is ornamented with a bull, which is the cre&s;t. As a fini&s;hing, under the medallion two cornucopias are introduced, repre&s;enting the general effect of plenty (attendant on the care of active magi&s;trates), connected by a civic crown, the reward among&s;t the Romans of civil virtue. The figure is placed again&s;t an obeli&s;k of white marble, eight feet high, on the top of which is a very elegant urn, bearing the family arms emblazoned; and on the foot of it is engraved the motto, "Con&s;tans Fidei." The whole is relieved by a ground of dove-coloured marble.</P>
<P>"We feel it a ju&s;tice we owe to the &s;uperior abilities of the arti&s;t, to add, that this elegant monument was executed by John Bacon, E&s;q. of the Royal Academy, who&s;e natural genius, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by foreign travel, has rai&s;ed him decidedly to the fir&s;t rank in his profe&s;&s;ion, and has enabled the pre&s;ent day to vie with the mo&s;t celebrated ages of antiquity in works of &s;culpture.

<P>"There are three chapels more belonging to the town, which are not parochial, viz. one belonging to St. Thomas' Ho&s;pital, another to the Trinity-Hou&s;e, and another to a &s;chool in Sandgate.

(See al&s;o lecturers of the other churches.) "The &s;alaries were not one and the &s;ame, but added and increa&s;ed as the town thought fit. Upon this fir&s;t &s;ettlement they had tho&s;e &s;alaries out of the town for preaching in the forenoon, and the pari&s;h did contribute for their preaching in the afternoons. Some time after the town of Newca&s;tle made an addition to the former &s;alaries, and gave them an allowance for preaching both forenoon and after|noon; upon which augmentation the pari&s;hes gave no farther contribution. In this &s;tate have the lecture&s;hips continued ever &s;ince, with an alteration &s;till of &s;alaries, more or le&s;s as there was occa&s;ion, and at the will and plea&s;ure of the patrons.

<P>"John Simp&s;on, hoa&s;tman, and Jane his wife, their burial place. In this grave of theirs was buried their elde&s;t &s;on, Ander&s;on, &s;o called as being a de&s;cendant of the worthy and loyal family of the Ander&s;ons of Braidley, who &s;uffered &s;o much in the time of the civil wars in defence of their king and country. He died May 17th, anno 1730, in the 21&s;t year of his age. He was a youth of fine parts, and good learning, a great deal of &s;weetne&s;s of temper and &s;trict religion."</P>
<P>"There is," &s;ays Bourne, "in this part of the church a very large &s;tone, in&s;culped with bra&s;s, of which &s;everal years ago no more could be read than hic tumulatus dono Dei datus mitis clero&mdash;promotor eccle&s;iarum. My authority imagines this to be the burial place of Robert Rhodes. He &s;ays the picture upon the &s;tone was very like that of Roger Thorn|ton; all the difference is, that the gown of this picture is not &s;o deep as that of Thornton's.&mdash;He conjectures it to be the burial place of Ro|bert Rhodes, becau&s;e of the words promotor eccle&s;iarum. Lib. All Hall. The words promotor eccle&s;iarum are not now to be found. However," continues Bourne, "had they been there &s;till, I think they are but a weak argument to prove that Robert Rhodes was buried here, when it is con&s;idered that he founded a chantry in St. Nicholas', that his own &s;oul and his wife's might be prayed for. For people were generally buried in the &s;ame church, and near the very place, where they erected a chantry or an altar. But whoever it is, this, I think, may be &s;afely concluded from the grandeur of the grave-&s;tone, that he was &s;ome wealthy per&s;on, and, from his being promotor eccle&s;iarum, that he was al&s;o religious.</P>
<P>"The effigies is very tall, and is &s;urrounded with very curious pictures of the &s;aints and &s;ome other things: but the bra&s;s is now tearing off, and going very fa&s;t into ruin. It is a pity (he adds) there &s;hould not be more care taken of it, as it is an ornament to the church, and the monument of its benefactor. The promotors of churches &s;hould be always remembered with the mo&s;t grateful re&s;pect, that they may be &s;hining lights to the mo&s;t di&s;tant ages."</P>

Yet there occurs in Madox's Formulare An|glicanum, a record, dated July 13th, 1466, which mentions fi&s;h-ponds at that time in this place.&mdash;It is a lea&s;e from John Roke&s;burgh, prior of the Black-Friars in Newca&s;tle, and the brethren thereof, to William Hays, of a certain great clo&s;e of theirs, built round with a &s;tone wall, for the term of his life, at the yearly rent of 25 &s;hillings, and allowing him to fix a &s;mall leaden pipe, of a bore large enough to admit a wheaten &s;traw, to their aqueduct, running in and through that clo&s;e, to their mona&s;tery, in order to &s;upply his fi&s;h-ponds with water, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It appears by the common-council books, July 5th, 1647, that certain referees, for bringing water to Sand-Gate, were appointed to view the conduit at Warden's Clo&s;e, and take &s;ome wa&s;hers with them to view the water, and report. There is an order ibid. dated July 30th, 1647, to bring water into the town of Newca&s;tle, from the Warden's Clo&s;e, "there having bene formerly time out of the memory of man a conduit of water att the north end of the Warden's Clo&s;e, which water had its cour&s;e and pa&s;&s;age into the War|den's Clo&s;e, and from thence thro' the Black-Friars, and &s;oe came into this towne."&mdash;" Of late years the free pa&s;&s;age and conduit hath bene &s;topped."&mdash;</P>
<P>Bourne, &s;peaking of Shoulder of Mutton Clo&s;e, which he &s;uppo&s;es anciently to have been part of the Warden's Clo&s;e, &s;ays, "There is in it a ci&s;tern of water which a friend of his imagined &s;upplied the Black Friars;" and adds, "the well belonging to this mona&s;tery may proceed from it."&mdash;Mr. Bertram Ander&s;on and Mr. Fawcus, &s;enior, informed me that they remembered a re&s;ervoir in the Shoulder of Mutton Clo&s;e, from whence a pipe con|ducted through the Town-Wall to the Friars, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The publick fountains, which at Newca&s;tle are of a particular con&s;truction, having each a &s;mall &s;quare re&s;ervoir before them for retaining the water for the u&s;e of hor&s;es, or for common dome&s;tic purpo&s;es, are called pants.</P>
<P>Dr. Thomas Hen&s;haw, in Skinner's Etymology, in verbo, tells us that pond was an|ciently pronounced pand, which Skinner derives, with great probability, from the Anglo-Saxon, pyndan, to inclo&s;e or &s;hut up. I am inclined to &s;uppo&s;e that pant is no more than pand, by a very &s;mall corruption, meaning a little re&s;ervoir or pond.

<P>Bourne tells us, al&s;o, that "&s;ome have imagined it to be called &s;o from a per&s;on of that name, who was its builder, or a benefactor to it."

"is the olde&s;t church in town, becau&s;e it is next the Barras, which hath been the ancient barracado of the town." It appears by the following quotation from Hearne's edition of the Chronicon of Whetham&s;tede, vol. ii. p. 532, that barriers for the defence of a town were erected in different parts of it: and indeed what would it avail to have it barricaded only in one place? "John de Cella," &s;ays that writer, "made abbot of St. Albans A. D. 1195, and who died A.

There is a reference from the word barreras, ex|plaining it by repagula, barriers. There were &s;uch erections al&s;o about Newca&s;tle.&mdash;See Froi&s;art's Chronicle&mdash;Battle of Otterbourn.&mdash;See al&s;o before in the account of Ever-Tower-Ward, where mention occurs of the barriers beyond Gallow-Gate, without New-Gate, "as men go to the gallows."</P></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>GATESHEAD IN THE COUNTY OF DURHAM.</HEAD>
<P>BEDE, in his Church Hi&s;tory, mentions a place which he calls "Caprae Caput," which has generally been &s;uppo&s;ed to mean Gate&s;|head&mdash;qua&s;i the goat's head, from the Romans having an inn <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><P>Hearne, in the preface to his Collection of curious Di&s;cour&s;es, p. 28, 29, &s;peaking of Antoninus' "ad An&s;am," has the&s;e words: "Though this place grew to be eminent and large at la&s;t, yet at fir&s;t it was only one diver&s;orium, or inn, on which there was the &s;ign of the An&s;a, by which name, for that rea&s;on, the whole &s;tation it&s;elf was called afterwards, a thing not uncommon to &s;everal other places, both in ancient as well as more modern times."</P>
<P>Dr. Stukeley, in his Iter Boreale, p. 69, &s;peaking of Gate&s;head, &s;ays, "I gue&s;s this was a fortified town in the times of the Romans, where a ferry was for pa&s;&s;age northward; but by rea&s;on of the buildings no traces of it are left. I &s;aw &s;everal Roman &s;tones here, the recipient parts of their hand-mills."</P>
<P>The doctor &s;uppo&s;ed that Gate&s;head was the Gabrocentum of the Notitia, where the &s;econd cohort of the Thracians were in garri&s;on, as its name in Briti&s;h imports "goat's head, I &s;uppo&s;e, from the &s;ign of &s;ome inn." He adds, "A goat's head &s;till &s;tands upon the &s;ign of the Golden Lion."</P>
<P>"Caput loci," according to Kennet's Glo&s;&s;ary to his Parochial Antiquities, &s;ignifies the end of a place&mdash;"ad caput villae," at the end of the town. Quaere, May not "Gate&s;heved" mean barely "the end of the road?" there having been di&s;covered no traces of a Roman road carried northwards from Newca&s;tle.</P>
<P>If Bede confounded "gate," via, with "goat," capra, which was anciently, and is &s;till, in the vulgar language of the north, pronounced "gate," he would naturally latinize it by "caprae caput," in&s;tead of "viae caput." It is ob&s;ervable, that in the dialect of the common people in the north of England, the way leading through a town is &s;till called "the Town-Gate."</P></NOTE> at this

<P>In the year 1226 mention occurs of an ho&s;pital <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><P>There is &s;aid to have been a mona&s;tery at Gate&s;head, A. D. 653, if the place called in Bede's Church Hi&s;tory "Caprae Caput," mu&s;t be under&s;tood to mean Gate&s;head, of which one Uttanus was then abbot: but of the foundation, continuance, and de&s;truction of this very ancient hou&s;e, no other memorials have been pre&s;erved. Tanner, in his Notitia Mona&s;tica, cites on this occa&s;ion Bede, lib. iii. cap. 21. See al&s;o Leland's Col|lectanea, vol. ii. p. 140. "Uttan pre&s;byter' inlu&s;tris et abbatis mona&s;terii quod vocatur ad Caprae Caput." Sic Beda &s;cribit: addit autem annotator ejus Doctor Smith in loco: "Caprae Caput hodie Gate&s;head ubi nulla remanent antiqui mona&s;terii Uttani ve&s;tigia. Recentioris quidem pulcherrimam videmus capellam, vix adhuc ruinis &s;uccumbentem. Traditio e&s;t cellam fui&s;&s;e &s;anctimonialium Novoca&s;tren&s;ium, licet ejus hi&s;toriam apud auctores vix inveneris." The place which Dr. Smith alludes to, and which &s;till re|mains, I take to have been the chapel of the ho&s;pital of the Trinity, if it was not the original chapel of that of St. Edmund. The pre&s;ent chapel of St. Edmund's ho&s;pital <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Plate, intitled "Statues of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Charles II. and Jame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE>, which is &s;ituated half a mile farther to the &s;outh, is of the very poore&s;t &s;tyle of architecture, and probably was erected after the obtaining of King James's charter to refound the ho&s;pital. St. Edmund's ho&s;pital, as &s;hewn before, was among the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the nuns of Newca&s;tle, and thence the tradition mentioned by Doctor Smith may have had its ri&s;e. This beautiful old chapel, from the &s;tyle of its architecture, cannot, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, be older than the reign of King Henry the Third: and it is ob&s;ervable, that the long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lips of windows are &s;imilar to tho&s;e at the end of the church of Tinmouth mona&s;tery, and tho&s;e in the Temple church in London.</P>

Some &s;teps at the ea&s;t end, leading to the altar, are &s;till re|maining: near them is a grave &s;tone, on which is cut a cro&s;s, &s;imilar to that in the jamb of the church door at Jarrow: it has al&s;o the marks of an inlaid border about it, but the bra&s;s is gone. The arches of the windows (except tho&s;e of the ea&s;t and we&s;t ends, which are entirely pointed) are round within, and pointed on the out&s;ide. A remarkable orna|ment is mounted on its ea&s;t end, on a &s;lender rod, being a &s;mall circle chequered by &s;everal bars cro&s;&s;ing each other at right angles."</P>
<P>This author is mi&s;taken in the account he gives of this place having been &s;et on fire. The Catholic chapel, which, out of a mi&s;guided zeal, was &s;et on fire on that occa&s;ion, was in a man&s;ion-hou&s;e adjoining to this ruinous chapel, the ruins of which man&s;ion-hou&s;e are &s;een in his view.&mdash;He very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that the entrance, which is through a low, &s;quare, &s;tone gate, decorated with pila&s;ters, is &s;eemingly of modern con&s;truction. &mdash;The &s;ite of the hou&s;e, he adds, with its offices and gardens, occupied about two acres and a half of land.&mdash;Towards the ea&s;t end of it are the ruins of a man&s;ion, which, from the &s;tyle of its architecture, &s;eems to have been built &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution of the mona&s;tery, perhaps out of its materials. This probably was Mr. Riddle's hou&s;e, alluded to by Bourne.&mdash;The gateway is probably of the &s;ame age. Gro&s;e al&s;o confounds the very an|cient mona&s;tery of Uttan and St. Edmund's ho&s;pital with this ruin. The former un|doubtedly peri&s;hed in tho&s;e depredations of the Barbarians, when all the religious hou&s;es in Northumberland were de&s;troyed.</P></NOTE> at Gate&s;head,

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX, P. 52. (No. 2.)</HI> An Act for enlarging the terms and powers of two acts of the twelfth and nineteenth years of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's reign, made for building a temporary bridge, and completing a new &s;tone bridge, over the river Tyne, between the town of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne and Gate&s;|head, in the county of Durham, and making the avenues to and the pa&s;&s;ages over the &s;ame more commodious; and for removing and preventing nui&s;ances and annoyances in the &s;treets, lanes, or avenues leading to the &s;aid new &s;tone bridge, within the town of Gate&s;head, in the county of Durham.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS an act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed in the twelfth year of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's reign, for building a temporary bridge over the river Tyne, between the town of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne and Gate&s;head, in the county of Durham, which temporary bridge was to have continuance from the twenty-fourth day of June one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-two, for the term of &s;even years; and in the nineteenth year of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's reign, another act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed, whereby the &s;aid tempo|rary bridge was continued for the further term of three years, and divers per&s;ons therein named were appointed tru&s;tees for putting the &s;aid la&s;t-mentioned act into execution, and were enabled to complete the new &s;tone bridge over the &s;aid river, and to make the avenues to, and the pa&s;&s;age over, the &s;aid new &s;tone bridge more commodious; and it was thereby enacted, that for and towards rai&s;ing money for the purpo&s;es of the &s;aid act, it &s;hould be lawful for the &s;aid tru&s;tees to take and receive &s;uch and the &s;ame tolls for the pa&s;&s;age of cattle, carriages, and other things over the &s;aid new &s;tone bridge, as by the &s;aid fir&s;t-mentioned act were authorized to be taken on the &s;aid temporary bridge, until the expiration of twelve years, to be computed from the twenty-fourth day of June one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-nine, or until &s;uch &s;ooner time as the &s;everal purpo&s;es of the &s;aid act of the nineteenth year of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's reign &s;hould be carried into execution, and the money borrowed upon the credit thereof, with intere&s;t, &s;hould be repayed; and it was provided and declared, by the &s;aid la&s;t-mentioned act, that the improvement of the avenues to the &s;aid new &s;tone bridge &s;hould end at the me&s;&s;uages and premi&s;es, then late Oliphant's, at the &s;outh abutment of the &s;aid new &s;tone bridge:</P>
<P>And whereas the &s;aid tru&s;tees have duly put the &s;aid act in execution, and have, by the money ari&s;ing from the &s;aid tolls and borrowed on the credit thereof, made and opened &s;uch avenues, and completed &s;uch other works within the limits pre&s;cribed by the &s;aid la&s;t-mentioned act, as were adjudged nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety and accommodation of the public; but the &s;outh avenue to the &s;aid new &s;tone bridge, beyond the premi&s;es late Oliphant's, in the town of Gate&s;head afore&s;aid, is inconvenient and dangerous to pa&s;&s;en|gers, by rea&s;on of the great declivity of the &s;treet there, called the Bottlebank, over which the high road leading from the city of Durham to the &s;aid bridge lies, though the &s;ame is capable of being rendered both &s;afe and commodious:</P>
<P>And whereas it will be of great public utility to effect the improvement of the &s;aid &s;outh avenue to the &s;aid bridge; but in regard that the &s;aid tru&s;tees appointed by the &s;aid act of the nineteenth year of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's reign, are thereby re&s;trained from making any improvement beyond the &s;aid premi&s;es late Oliphant's, and &s;uch intended improvements of the &s;aid &s;outh avenue cannot be effectually made, unle&s;s the &s;aid tolls are further continued, and the terms and powers of both the &s;aid acts enlarged: May it therefore plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, that it may be enacted, and be it enacted, by the King's mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the lords &s;piritual and

<P><PB N="602" REF="637">Draiton, in the 29th &s;ong of his Polyolbion, thus introduces a poetical de&s;cription of the Roman Wall:
<Q><L>"But Picts-Wall all this while, as though he had been lo&s;t,</L>

<L>Comparing our de&s;cents, which &s;hall appeare to be</L>
<L>Mere up&s;tarts, ba&s;ely borne; for when I was in hand,</L>

<L>Who for the Devil's worke the vulgar dare avow,</L>

<L>Where many a reverent booke can tell you of my man,</L>
<L>And when I fir&s;t decayed, Severus going on</L>
<L>What Adrian built of turfe, he builded new of &s;tone;</L>

<P>During my re&s;idence at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, prompted by an ardour of curio&s;ity bordering on enthu&s;ia&s;m, I occa&s;ionally made &s;everal excur&s;ions to examine the &s;till re|maining ve&s;tiges of tho&s;e &s;tupendous works, rai&s;ed here by a people who were ju&s;tly &s;tyled the conquerors of the world, for the great purpo&s;e of protecting in their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions

<P>Hadrian's <HI>Vallum,</HI> as it is al&s;o called, appears to have been a <HI>turf</HI> wall, with a deep fo&s;s or ditch accompa|nying it on the north &s;ide. There was another, called by Hor&s;ley the South Agger, at the di&s;tance of about five paces to the &s;outh of it, as al&s;o another and larger agger on the north &s;ide of the ditch, which the &s;ame writer &s;uppo&s;es to have been the military way to this work, as it had been before to the pretentura of &s;tations. The&s;e four works, it is very ob&s;ervable, keep all the way a con&s;tant regular paralleli&s;m one to another. The &s;ame writer acknowledges, that there is no determining with certainty what was the ori|ginal height of this mud wall and its aggers; of which he conjectures the &s;outhern one to have been for an inner defence in ca&s;e they &s;hould be beaten from the principal work, or to protect the &s;oldiers again&s;t any &s;udden attack from the provincial Britons.&mdash;See Britannia Romana, p. 117.</P>
