<HEAD>WHITE's JOURNAL OF A VOYAGE TO <HI>NEW SOUTH WALES.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P><MILESTONE N="1787" UNIT="year"><MILESTONE N="March" UNIT="month"> I THIS day left London, charged with di&s;patches from the Secretary of State's office, and from the Admiralty, relative to the embarkation of that part of the marines and convicts intended for Botany Bay; and on the evening of the &s;eventh, after travelling two days of the mo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant rain I ever remember, arrived at Plymouth, where the Charlotte and Friend&s;hip tran&s;ports were in readine&s;s to receive them.</P>
<P>General Collins, commander in chief at that port, lo&s;t no time in carrying the orders I had brought into execu|tion: &s;o that on the morning of the ninth, the detachment of marines were on board, with all the baggage. But the
<PB N="2" REF="18">next day being u&s;hered in with a very heavy gale of wind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1787. March.</NOTE> made it impracticable to remove the convicts from on board the Dunkirk pri&s;on-&s;hip, where they were confined. So violent was the gale, that his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Druid, of thirty-two guns, was forced to cut away her main-ma&s;t to prevent her driving on &s;hore.</P>
<P>The weather being moderate the following day, the con|victs were put on board the tran&s;ports, and placed in the different apartments allotted for them; all &s;ecured in irons, except the women. In the evening, as there was but little wind, we were towed by the boats belonging to the guard&s;hips out of the Hamaoze, where the Dunkirk lay, into Plymouth Sound. When this duty was completed, the boats returned; and the wind now fre&s;hening &s;o as to enable us to clear the land, we proceeded to Spithead, where we arrived the &s;eventeenth, and anchored on the Mother Bank, among the re&s;t of the tran&s;ports and victuallers intended for the &s;ame expedition, under the conduct of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Sirius. As &s;oon as the &s;hip came to anchor, I vi&s;ited all the other tran&s;ports, and was really &s;urpri&s;ed to find the convicts on board them &s;o very healthy. When I got on board the Alexander, I found there a medi|cal
<PB N="3" REF="19">gentleman from Port&s;mouth, among who&s;e acquaintance I had not the honour to be numbered. He &s;carcely gave me time to get upon the quarter-deck, before he thus addre&s;&s;ed me&mdash;<Q>I am very glad you are arrived, Sir; for your people have got a <HI>malignant</HI> di&s;ea&s;e among them of a mo&s;t dangerous kind; and it will be nece&s;&s;ary, for their pre&s;ervation, to get them immediately relanded!</Q> Sur|pri&s;ed at &s;uch a &s;alutation, and alarmed at the purport of it, I reque&s;ted of my a&s;&s;i&s;tant, Mr. Balmain, an intelligent young man, whom I had appointed to this &s;hip for the voyage, to let me &s;ee the people who were ill. "Sir," re|turned Mr. Balmain, taking me a&s;ide, <Q>you will not find things by any means &s;o bad as this gentleman repre&s;ents them to be: they are made much wor&s;e by him than they really are. Unlike a per&s;on wi&s;hing to admini&s;ter comfort to tho&s;e who are afflicted, either in body or in mind, he has publicly declared before the poor creatures who are ill, that they mu&s;t inevitably fall a &s;acrifice to the malignant di&s;order with which they are afflicted;&mdash; the malignity of which appears to me to exi&s;t only in his own imagination. I did not, however,</Q> continued Mr. Bal|main, <Q>think proper to contradict the gentleman; &s;uppo&s;ing,
<PB N="4" REF="20">from the con&s;equence he a&s;&s;umed, and the ea&s;e with which he had given his opinion, or more properly his <HI>directions,</HI> that he was &s;ome per&s;on appointed by the Secretary of State to officiate for you till your arrival. When you go among the people you will be better able to judge of the propriety of what I have &s;aid.</Q> Mr. Balmain had no &s;ooner concluded than I went between decks, and found every thing ju&s;t as he had repre&s;ented it to be. There were &s;everal in bed with &s;light inflammatory complaints; &s;ome there were who kept their bed to avoid the inconvenience of the cold, which was at this time very piercing, and who&s;e wretched clothing was but a poor defence again&s;t the rigour of it; others were confined to their bed through the effects of long impri&s;onment, a weakened habit, and low|ne&s;s of &s;pirits; which was not a little added to by the de|claration of the medical gentleman above mentioned, whom they concluded to be the principal &s;urgeon to the expedi|tion. However, on my undeceiving them in that point, and at the &s;ame time confirming what Mr. Balmain had from the fir&s;t told them, viz. <HI>that their complaints were neither malig|nant nor dangerous,</HI> their fears abated. To this I added, that I would immediately give orders for &s;uch as were in
<PB N="5" REF="21">want of clothing, to be &s;upplied with what was needful; a power delegated to me by Captain Phillip, together with the liberty of giving &s;uch other directions as I thought would tend to the recovery or pre&s;ervation of their health. And further, as they had been nearly four months on board, and during that time had been kept upon &s;alt provi&s;ions, I would endeavour to get fre&s;h for them while in port. This &s;hort conver&s;ation had &s;o &s;udden an effect on tho&s;e I addre&s;&s;ed, and was of &s;o oppo&s;ite a tendency to that of the gentleman alluded to, that before we got from between decks, I had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee &s;everal of them put on &s;uch clothes as they had, and look a little cheerful. I then pointed out to Lieutenant John&s;on, commanding officer of the marines on board, and to the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip, the nece&s;&s;ity there was of admitting the convicts upon the deck, one half at a time, during the cour&s;e of the day; in order that they might breathe a purer air, as nothing would conduce more to the pre&s;erva|tion of their health. To this the&s;e gentlemen readily a&s;&s;ent|ed; adding, that they had no objection to the whole num|ber coming upon deck at once, if I thought it nece&s;&s;ary, as they were not apprehen&s;ive of any danger from the indul|gence. On returning to the quarter-deck, I found my new
<PB N="6" REF="22">medical acquaintance &s;till there; and before I could give &s;ome directions to Mr. Balmain, as I was about to do, he thus once more addre&s;&s;ed me&mdash;<Q>I &s;uppo&s;e you are now convinced of the dangerous di&s;ea&s;e that prevails among the&s;e people, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of having them landed, in order to get rid of it.</Q> Not a little hurt at the ab&s;urd part the gentleman had acted, and at his repeated importu|nity, I replied with &s;ome warmth, <Q>that I was very &s;orry to differ &s;o e&s;&s;entially in opinion from him, as to be obliged to tell him that there was not <HI>the lea&s;t appearance</HI> of malignity in the di&s;ea&s;e under which the convicts labour|ed, but that it wholly proceeded from the cold; and was nearly &s;imilar to a complaint then prevalent, even among the better &s;ort of people, in and about Port&s;mouth.</Q> Notwith&s;tanding this, he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted &s;o much in the pro|priety of their being landed, and the nece&s;&s;ity there was for an application to the Secretary of State upon the occa&s;ion, that I could no longer keep my temper; and I freely told him, <Q>that the idea of landing them was as improper as it was ab&s;urd. And, in order to make him perfectly ea&s;y on that head, I a&s;&s;ured him, that when any di&s;ea&s;e ren|dered it nece&s;&s;ary to call in medical aid, he might re&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="23">&s;atisfied I would not trouble <HI>him;</HI> but would apply to Doctor Lind, Phy&s;ician to the Royal Ho&s;pital at Ha&s;ler, a gentleman as eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed for his profe&s;|&s;ional abilities as his other amiable qualities; or el&s;e to &s;ome of the &s;urgeons of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips in Port&s;mouth harbour, or at Spithead, mo&s;t of whom I had the plea|&s;ure of knowing, and on who&s;e medical knowledge I was certain I could depend.</Q> This peremptory declaration had the de&s;ired effect. The gentleman took his leave, to my great &s;atisfaction, and thereby gave me an opportunity of writing by that evening's po&s;t, to inform the Secretary of State, and Captain Phillip, of the real &s;tate of the &s;ick; and at the &s;ame time to urge the nece&s;&s;ity of having fre&s;h pro|vi&s;ions &s;erved to the whole of the convicts while in port, as well as a little wine for tho&s;e who were ill. Fre&s;h provi|&s;ions I dwelt mo&s;t on, as being not only needful for the recovery of the &s;ick, but otherwi&s;e e&s;&s;ential, in order to prevent any of them commencing &s;o long and tedious a voyage as they had before them with a &s;corbutic taint; a con&s;equence that would mo&s;t likely attend their living upon &s;alt food; and which, added to their needful confinement and great numbers, would, in all probability, prove fatal
<PB N="8" REF="24">to them, and thereby defeat the intention of Govern|ment.</P>
<P>The return of the po&s;t brough me an an&s;wer; and like|wi&s;e an order to the contractor for &s;upplying the marines and convicts daily with fre&s;h beef and vegetables, while in port. A &s;imilar order I found had been given long before my arrival; but, by &s;ome &s;trange mi&s;take or other, had not been complied with. The &s;alutary effect of this change of diet, with the addition of &s;ome wine and other nece&s;&s;aries ordered for the &s;ick, through the humanity of Lord Sydney, manife&s;ted it&s;elf &s;o &s;uddenly, that in the &s;pace of a fort|night, on comparing my li&s;t of &s;ick with that of a &s;urgeon belonging to one of the guard&s;hips, allowing for the di&s;pro|portion of numbers, mine did not exceed his. And yet, not|with&s;tanding this, which is a well known fact, the report of a mo&s;t malignant di&s;ea&s;e &s;till prevailed: and &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly was the report promulgated and kept alive by &s;ome evil-minded people, who either wi&s;hed to throw an odium on the humane promoters of the plan, or to give unea&s;ine&s;s to the friends and relations of tho&s;e engaged in the expedition, that letters from all quarters were pouring in upon us, commi&s;erating our &s;tate. The new&s;papers were daily filled with alarming
<PB N="9" REF="25">accounts of the fatality that prevailed among us; and the rumour became general, notwith&s;tanding every &s;tep was taken to remove the&s;e fears, by a&s;&s;urances (which were &s;trictly true) that the whole fleet was in as good a &s;tate of health, and as few in it would be found to be ill, at that cold &s;ea&s;on of the year, as even in the mo&s;t healthy &s;ituation on &s;hore. The cleare&s;t te&s;timony that there was more ma|lignity in the report than in the di&s;ea&s;e, may be deduced from the very incon&s;iderable number that have died &s;ince we left England; which I may &s;afely venture to &s;ay is much le&s;s than ever was known in &s;o long a voyage (the numbers being proportionate), even though not labouring under the di&s;advantages we were &s;ubject to, and the crowded &s;tate we were in.</P>
<P>During the ab&s;ence of Captain Phillip, I mentioned to Captain Hunter of the Sirius, that I thought whitewa&s;hing with quick lime the parts of the &s;hips where the convicts were confined, would be the means of correcting and preventing that unwhole&s;ome dampne&s;s which u&s;ually ap|peared on the beams and &s;ides of the &s;hips, and was occa|&s;ioned by the breath of the people. Captain Hunter agreed with me on the propriety of the &s;tep: and with that oblig|ing
<PB N="10" REF="26"><MILESTONE N="May" UNIT="month"> willingne&s;s which marks his character, made the nece&s;|&s;ary application to commi&s;&s;ioner Martin; who, on his part, as readily ordered the proper materials. The proce&s;s was accordingly &s;oon fini&s;hed; and fully an&s;wered the purpo&s;e intended.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>May 12. His Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Hyaena joined us this day, and put her&s;elf under the command of Captain Phillip, who had in&s;tructions to take her with him as far as he &s;hould think needful. In the evening the Sirius made the &s;ignal to weigh, and attempted to get down to St. Helen's; but the wind &s;hifting, and &s;everal of the convoy not getting under way, through &s;ome irregularity in the &s;eamen, &s;he was obliged to anchor. When this was done, Captain Phillip &s;ent Lieutenant King on board the &s;hips which had occa&s;ioned the detention, who &s;oon adju&s;ted the difficulties that had ari&s;en; as they were found to proceed more from intoxication than from any nautical cau&s;es.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>13th. This morning the Sirius and her convoy weighed again, with an intention of going through St. Helen's; but the wind being fair for the Needles, we run through them, with a plea&s;ant breeze. The Charlotte, Captain Gilbert, on board of which I was, &s;ailing very heavy, the
<PB N="11" REF="27">Hyaena took us in tow, until &s;he brought us ahead of the Sirius, and then ca&s;t us off.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>15th. An accident of a &s;ingular nature happened to-day. Corporal Baker of the marines, on laying a loaded mu&s;quet down, which he had ju&s;t taken out of the arms che&s;t, was wounded by it in the inner ankle of the right foot. The bones, after being a good deal &s;hattered, turned the ball; which taking another direction, had &s;till force enough left to go through a harne&s;s-ca&s;k full of beef, at &s;ome di&s;tance, and, after that, to kill two gee&s;e that were on the other &s;ide of it. Extraordinary as this incident may appear, it is no le&s;s true. The corporal being a young man, and in a good habit of body, I had the plea&s;ure, contrary to the general expectation, of &s;eeing him return to his duty in three months, with the perfect u&s;e of the wounded joint.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>20th. A di&s;covery of a futile &s;cheme, formed by the convicts on board the Scarborough, was made by one of that body, who had been recommended to Captain Hunter previous to our &s;ailing. They had laid a plan for making them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the &s;hip; but being prevented by this di&s;covery, two of the ringleaders were carried on board the Sirius, where they were puni&s;hed; and afterwards put on
<PB N="12" REF="28"><MILESTONE N="June" UNIT="month"> board the Prince of Wales tran&s;port, from which time they behaved very well. Being now near one hundred leagues to the we&s;tward of Scilly, and all well, Captain Phillip found it no longer nece&s;&s;ary to keep the Hyaena with him; there|fore, having committed his letters to the care of the Hon. Captain De Courcey, he in the cour&s;e of this day &s;ent her back.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>28th. Departed this life, I&s;mael Coleman, a convict, who, worn out by lowne&s;s of &s;pirits and debility, brought on by long and clo&s;e confinement, re&s;igned his breath without a pang.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>30th. In the forenoon pa&s;&s;ed to the &s;outhward of Ma|deira, and &s;aw &s;ome turtle of the hawks-bill kind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>June 2d. Saw and pa&s;&s;ed the Salvages. The&s;e i&s;lands are not laid down in any of the charts we had on board, except a &s;mall one, by Hamilton Moore, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;econd mate. They lie, by our ob&s;ervation, in lat. 30&deg;. 10&prime;. N. long. 15&deg;. 9&prime;. W.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>3d. This evening, after &s;eeing many &s;mall fi&s;h in our way from the Salvages, we arrived at Teneriffe, and an|chored in Santa Cruz road, about a mile to the N. E. of the town of that name, in &s;ixteen fathom water; &s;ome of the
<PB N="13" REF="29">&s;hips came to in twenty fathom. We were vi&s;ited the &s;ame night, as is the cu&s;tom of the port, by the harbour ma&s;ter, and gained permi&s;&s;ion to water, and procure &s;uch refre&s;h|ments as the i&s;land afforded. The marines were now &s;erved with wine in lieu of &s;pirits; a pound of fre&s;h beef was like|wi&s;e daily di&s;tributed to them as well as to the convicts; to|gether with a pound of rice in&s;tead of bread, and &s;uch vege|tables as could be procured. Of the latter indeed the por|tion was rather &s;canty, little be&s;ides onions being to be got; and &s;till le&s;s of fruit, it being too early in the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>4th. Captain Phillip, as governor of his Maje&s;ty's ter|ritories in New South Wales, and commander in chief of the expedition, accompanied by twenty of the principal officers, paid his re&s;pects to the Marquis de Brancifort, governor of this and the other Canary i&s;lands. We were received by his Excellency with great politene&s;s and cor|diality; and after the ceremony of introduction was over, he entered into familiar conver&s;ation with Captain Phillip on general topics. In per&s;on the Marquis is genteel; he is rather above the middle &s;ize, but cannot boa&s;t of much <HI>embonpoint;</HI> his countenance is animated; his deportment ea&s;y and graceful; and both his appearance and manners
<PB N="14" REF="30">perfectly corre&s;pond with the idea univer&s;ally entertained of the dignity of a grandee of Spain. This accompli&s;hed nobleman, as I have been informed, is not a Spaniard by birth, but a Sicilian; and de&s;cended from &s;ome of the princes of that i&s;land. On this ance&s;try and de&s;cent, it is vi&s;ible that he prides him&s;elf not a little. The people he is placed over will have it, that he carries him&s;elf with too much &s;tateline&s;s to be long a favourite there; they cannot, however, help acknowledging that he pre&s;erves a degree of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, moderation, and ju&s;tice, in his conduct to|wards them, that is not to be objected to.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>6th. A convict, named James Clark, died of a drop&s;y; he had been tapped ten days before, and di&s;charged twelve quarts of water.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>8th. During the night, while the people were bu&s;ily employed in taking in water on board the Alexander, a &s;ervice in which &s;ome of the convicts a&s;&s;i&s;ted, one of them, of the name of Powel, found means to drop him&s;elf unper|ceived into a &s;mall boat that lay along-&s;ide; and under cover of the night to ca&s;t her off without di&s;covery. He then drifted to a Dutch Ea&s;t Indiaman that had ju&s;t come to an anchor, to the crew of which he told a plau&s;ible &s;tory,
<PB N="15" REF="31">and entreated to be taken on board; but, though they much wanted men, they would have nothing to do with him. Having committed him&s;elf again to the waves, he was driven by the wind and the current, in the cour&s;e of the night, to a &s;mall i&s;land lying to leeward of the &s;hips, where he was the next morning taken. The boat and oars, which he could not conceal, led to a di&s;covery; otherwi&s;e he would probably have effected his e&s;cape. When brought back by the party &s;ent after him, Captain Phillip ordered him into irons, in which &s;tate he remained for &s;ome time; but at length, by an artful petition he got written for him, he &s;o wrought on the governor's humanity, as to procure a relea&s;e from his confinement.</P>
<P>As you approach the i&s;land of Teneriffe, and even when you are near to it, the appearance from the &s;ea conveys no very favourable idea of its fertility; one rugged, barren hill or mountain terminating in another, until it forms the famous <HI>Peak.</HI> The town of Santa Cruz is large and populous, but very irregular and ill built; &s;ome of the private hou&s;es, however, are &s;pacious, convenient, and well con&s;tructed. Although this town is not con&s;idered as the capital, Laguna enjoying that pre-eminence, yet I can|not
<PB N="16" REF="32">help thinking it ought to be &s;o; not only from its being more frequented by &s;hips of various nations, and having a greater &s;hare of trade than any other port in the Canaries, but on account of its being the re&s;idence of the governor-general.</P>
<P>Among other &s;teps for its improvement, the Marquis &s;et on foot a contribution, and from the produce of it has cau&s;ed to be built an elegant and commodious mole, or pier, about the center of the town. To this pier, water of an ex|cellent quality is conveyed by pipes; &s;o that boats may come along-&s;ide, and by applying a ho&s;e to the cocks placed there for this purpo&s;e, fill the ca&s;ks without the u&s;ual trouble and fatigue. The landing or &s;hipping of goods is likewi&s;e, by means of this pier, rendered both convenient and expe|ditious. In &s;hort, I think I may &s;afely recommend this port as a very good one for &s;hips undertaking long voyages to water at, and refre&s;h their crews; more e&s;pecially in the time of the fruit &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>About four or five miles, inland, from Santa Cruz, &s;tands the city of Laguna; &s;o called from a lake near which it is &s;ituated. This lake, during the winter, or in rainy weather, is full of &s;tagnant water, that in a little time
<PB N="17" REF="33">becomes putrid, and, in very dry hot weather, is to|tally exhaled. I have before ob&s;erved, that Laguna is con&s;idered as the capital of the i&s;land, and added my rea|&s;ons for thinking this an ill-judged di&s;tinction. The road from Santa Cruz to it is a pretty &s;teep a&s;cent, until you ap|proach the town, which is &s;ituated at the extremity, or rather on a corner, of a plain three or four miles long. This city has two churches, one of them richly ornamented; and &s;everal convents both of friars and nuns. It has like|wi&s;e three ho&s;pitals; two of which were originally in&s;tituted for the wi&s;e, but ineffectual, purpo&s;e of eradicating the <HI>lues venerea;</HI> a di&s;ea&s;e that has long been, and &s;till continues to be, very common in this i&s;land. I was however informed, that per&s;ons afflicted with other di&s;orders are now received into the&s;e two charitable in&s;titutions; and that the third is appropriated to the reception of foundlings. Be&s;ides the foregoing, there are &s;ome other public, as well as private buildings, that tend to improve the appearance of the town. There is very little trade carried on at Laguna, it being rather the retired re&s;idence of the gentry of the i&s;land, and of the merchants of Santa Cruz, which is the principal &s;eat of commerce.

<PB N="18" REF="34">&s;uch as the corrigedor, lieutenant of the police, &amp;c. and a judge who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to regulate commercial affairs. An office of inqui&s;ition, with the proper officers, delegated from, and &s;ubject to, the tribunal of the holy office held at Grand Canary, is be&s;ides e&s;tabli&s;hed here.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent natives of this i&s;land &s;eem to have in them very little of the &s;tock from whence they &s;prung; intermar|riages with the Spaniards have nearly obliterated all traces of the original &s;tamina: they are of a middle &s;tature, in|clining to be &s;lender, and of a dark complexion, with large animated black eyes. The pea&s;ants in general are wretch|edly clothed; when they do appear better, they are habited in the Spani&s;h fa&s;hion. The men, in a genteeler line, dre&s;s very gaily, and are &s;eldom &s;een without long &s;words. It is remarked, that few of them walk with dignity and ea&s;e; which may be attributed to the long cloaks they u&s;ually wear, except on particular occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The women wear veils: tho&s;e worn by the lower ranks are of black &s;tuff, tho&s;e of the higher, of black &s;ilk; and &s;uch among the latter as have any claim to beauty, are far from being over careful in concealing their faces by them. The young ladies, &s;ome of whom I &s;aw that were
<PB N="19" REF="35">really pretty, wear their fine long black hair plaited, and fa&s;tened with a comb, or a ribbon, on the top of the head.</P>
<P>The common people, and in this they re&s;emble the inha|bitants of mo&s;t of the i&s;lands in the Pacific Ocean lately di&s;|covered, have a &s;trong &s;pice of furacity in them; they are be&s;ides lazy; and the mo&s;t importunate beggars in the world: I ob&s;erved likewi&s;e, that the itch was &s;o common among them, and had attained &s;uch a degree of virulence, that one would almo&s;t be led to believe it was <HI>epidemic</HI> there.</P>
<P>Some of the women are &s;o abandoned and &s;hamele&s;s, that it would be doing an inju&s;tice to the pro&s;titutes met with in the &s;treets of London, to &s;ay they are like them. The fe|males of every degree are &s;aid to be of an amorous con&s;titu|tion, and addicted to intrigue; for which no hou&s;es could be better adapted than tho&s;e in Teneriffe.</P>
<P>The manufactures carried on here are very few, and the product of them little more than &s;ufficient for their own con&s;umption. They con&s;i&s;t of taffeties, gauze, coar&s;e linens, blankets, a little &s;ilk, and curious garters. The principal dependance of the inhabitants is on their wine (their &s;taple commodity), oil, corn, and every kind of &s;tock for &s;hipping.
<PB N="20" REF="36">With the&s;e the i&s;land abounds; and, in their &s;ea&s;on, pro|duces not only the tropical fruits, but the vegetable produc|tions of the European gardens, in the greate&s;t plenty. Te|neriffe enjoys an agreeable and healthful mediocrity of climate. Indeed I know of none better adapted for the re&s;toration of a valetudinarian; as, by going into the mountains, he may graduate the air, and chu&s;e that &s;tate of it which be&s;t &s;uits his complaint. But although the inhabitants are thus healthy, and have &s;o little occa&s;ion for medical aid, they loudly com|plain of the want of knowledge in the profe&s;&s;ional gentlemen of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent governor has e&s;tabli&s;hed a manufactory of &s;ilk and woollen goods in the &s;uburbs of Santa Cruz, which is carried on by poor children, old and infirm people, and by abandoned females, with a view to reclaiming them: an in&s;titution that will ever do honour both to his excellency, and to tho&s;e who have liberally aided him in &s;o laudable a &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Like the inhabitants of mo&s;t catholic countries, the people of this i&s;land are very profu&s;e in decorating their churches, and even their dwelling-hou&s;es, on the fe&s;tivals held in honour of their &s;aints. This being <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti,</HI> a
<PB N="21" REF="37">day of much &s;olemnity and parade, I went on &s;hore with Lieutenant Ball of the Supply to &s;ee the proce&s;&s;ion incident to the occa&s;ion. Before we landed we formed a re&s;olution to avoid, as much as lay in our power, giving offence even to the mo&s;t zealous devotee. But we found this was not to be done. When we arrived at the church, from whence the proce&s;&s;ion commenced, the Ho&s;t was ju&s;t making its appear|ance; a circum&s;tance that is announced by ringing of bells, and firing of guns. As it pa&s;&s;ed by us we fell on our knees, as we ob&s;erved tho&s;e around us to do; but it unfortunately happening, that the &s;pot we knelt upon con&s;i&s;ted of &s;and intermixed with &s;mall rough pebbles, the po&s;ture we were in &s;oon became &s;o exceedingly painful, that, in order to pro|cure a momentary ea&s;e, we only let one knee remain on the ground. This heretical act did not e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of one of the holy fathers, all of whom were intent on the exact performance of every ceremonious etiquette. It procured for us a frown from him, and treatment that was not of the mo&s;t civil kind; &s;o that, in order to pacify him, we again dropped on both knees. He did not, however, pa&s;s on, without exhi|biting &s;trong marks of ill-nature and re&s;entment in his coun|tenance, at this trivial and unintended breach of re&s;pectful
<PB N="22" REF="38">attention to the religious rights of the country. The pro|ce&s;&s;ion, in which the governor and all the principal inhabi|tants joined, having pa&s;&s;ed through mo&s;t of the &s;treets, returned, with the &s;ame &s;olemnity, to the church it had &s;et out from; which was richly ornamented, and &s;plendidly illuminated with large wax tapers, upon the occa&s;ion. During our &s;tay here, his excellency the governor entertained Captain Phillip and all the officers belonging to the expedi|tion with a very elegant dinner.</P>
<P>Before we &s;ailed from the Motherbank, a <HI>&s;poratic</HI> di&s;ea&s;e had appeared among the marines and convicts. On its fir&s;t appearance it re&s;embled the mumps, or &s;wellings of the chaps; and as that di&s;temper &s;ometimes terminates in a tran&s;lation of the inflammation to the te&s;ticles, &s;o this complaint (after the &s;welling and induration of the jaws had &s;ub&s;ided, which u&s;ually happened on the &s;ixth or &s;eventh day) never in one in&s;tance failed to fix on tho&s;e parts; and that in &s;o very ob&s;tinate a manner, as not to give way to the treatment generally found effectual in &s;imilar inflammations. One of the convicts, thus affected, was &s;eized with an intermitting fever: between the paroxy&s;m I gave him an emetic; which had &s;uch a &s;udden and wonderful effect on this &s;trange com|plaint,
<PB N="23" REF="39">that I was induced to repeat it; and I found it effectual in this, as well as in all &s;ub&s;equent ca&s;es. As &s;oon as we got to &s;ea, the motion of the &s;hip acted on all tho&s;e who were affected, to the number of &s;eventeen, in a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing and extraordinary manner. Indeed it was &s;o &s;ud|den, that it was like a <HI>placebo.</HI> I could never account, with any &s;atisfaction to my&s;elf, for the origin of this uncommon di&s;ea&s;e, though much acquainted with tho&s;e incident to &s;eamen; nor did I ever &s;ee or hear of any that re&s;embled it. The mo&s;t &s;teady and prudent of the mariners, even tho&s;e who had their wives on board, were equally affected with tho&s;e who led more irregular lives. At fir&s;t I attributed it to the verdigrea&s;e that might gather on the copper uten&s;ils wherein the provi&s;ions were cooked; but I am now fully per&s;uaded that this was not the &s;ource from which it pro|ceeded; for at the very time it was mo&s;t prevalent, and at|tended with the greate&s;t degree of inveteracy, the coppers were cleaned, and made as bright as they could be, every day, under my own in&s;pection. Another proof, and a very &s;trong one, that it did not proceed from the before-mentioned cau&s;e is, that the provi&s;ions &s;till continued to be dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame coppers, when the &s;malle&s;t trace of the di&s;ea&s;e was no
<PB N="24" REF="40">longer to be perceived; which was the ca&s;e after being four or five days at &s;ea.</P>

<P>9th, P.

<P>10th. This morning the fleet got under way with a light breeze, which carried us out of Santa Cruz, but left us two days becalmed between Teneriffe and the Grand Canary.

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>18th. Early this morning the Sirius threw out the Sup|ply's &s;ignal to make &s;ail, and look out ahead. She imme|diately obeyed, and at eight o'clock made the &s;ignal for &s;eeing land; which was repeated by the Sirius to the con|voy. At eleven we pa&s;&s;ed the I&s;le of Sal, in lat. 16&deg; 38&prime; N. long. 22&deg; 5&prime; W., and in the evening Bonavi&s;ta; two of the Cape de Verd i&s;lands, a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands &s;o called from a cape of that name &s;ituated oppo&s;ite to them on the continent of Africa. We pa&s;&s;ed the latter i&s;land &s;o clo&s;e, that we &s;aw the breakers which endangered Captain Cook's &s;hip in his la&s;t voyage. It blew at the time pretty fre&s;h, and was &s;o hazy, that we could make no other ob&s;ervation, than that the land was high, and the &s;hore (what we could per|ceive of it through the haze, for the horizon line did not exceed two miles) had a white appearance, as if &s;and or chalk cliffs. At &s;ix in the evening, the Sirius made a &s;ignal for the convoy to ob&s;erve a clo&s;e order of &s;ailing, and to &s;horten &s;ail for the night; and at twelve, running under an ea&s;y &s;ail,

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>19th. At day break we made fail, the Supply being a|head on the look-out. At eight o'clock &s;he made the &s;ig|nal for &s;eeing land; which proved to be the i&s;le of Mayo, another of the Cape de Verd i&s;lands, lying in lat. 15&deg; 10&prime; N. long. 23&deg; W. The Sirius now made the &s;ignal to prepare to anchor; which was followed by one, that the boats from the victuallers and tran&s;ports may land, as &s;oon as the &s;hips came to an anchor, without a&s;king permi&s;&s;ion as at Teneriffe. We ran down the ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, clo&s;e in with the &s;hore, on which we could perceive a high &s;urf, or rather the &s;ea, breaking violently among the rocks. The haze &s;till con|tinued &s;o thick that we could only ob&s;erve the &s;hore to be rough, craggy, and bold; and that &s;everal parts of the i&s;land &s;eemed high and mountainous. At twelve, through the haze, &s;aw the i&s;land of Saint Jago, the principal of the Cape de Verd i&s;lands, lying in lat. 14&deg; 54&prime; N. long. 23&deg; 29&prime; W. Half after one, the Sirius leading into Port Praya Bay, on a &s;udden brought to, as we imagined, to wait for the &s;tern|mo&s;t &s;hips, which, as they all came up, likewi&s;e brought to,
<PB N="27" REF="43">on the out&s;ide of the entrance into the bay. After the pre|parations which had been made for anchoring, and the di&s;|po&s;ition &s;hown by the Sirius to run in, we were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee her, at two o'clock, throw out the &s;ignal for the convoy to keep nearer the commanding officer; then make &s;ail and bear away, &s;teering &s;outh-we&s;t. At &s;ix in the evening we lo&s;t &s;ight of the i&s;land, running with a &s;mart top-gallant, and &s;teering &s;ail, breeze at north-ea&s;t. A &s;mall Portugueze brig lay at anchor in Por Praya, which was the only ve&s;&s;el of any kind at that time there. This bay is rendered memorable by the action that took place there, on the 16th of April 1781, between Commodore John&s;tone and Mon&s;ieur Suffrein; in giving an account of which, the French admiral (in a letter &s;aid to be written by him) humorou&s;ly thus ob&s;erves: <Q>In leading into the bay, I was &s;ome time at a lo&s;s to di&s;tingui&s;h which was the commodore's &s;hip: but on getting more in, I at length &s;aw his pendant blu&s;hing through a fore&s;t of ma&s;ts; the Romney being &s;ecurely placed in &s;hore of the merchant &s;hips and &s;maller men of war.</Q></P>
<P>The entrance into this bay appeared to be about a mile, between two bluff points, which makes it &s;ecure from every
<PB N="28" REF="44">wind, except a &s;outherly one; and when that prevails, a very high &s;ea tumbles into it. On an eminence, in the cen|ter of the bay, &s;tands a fort, where the Portugueze colours were di&s;played. Many people appeared on the batteries, look|ing at the &s;hips; which were probably more in number than had been &s;een there &s;ince the memorable 16th of April. The appearance of the town and the i&s;land, from the di&s;tant view we had, gave us no very favourable opinion of them. The face of the country &s;eemed to be &s;terile in the extreme. The lifele&s;s brown of the I&s;le of Mayo, de&s;cribed by Cap|tain Cook, may very well be applied to this i&s;land; for as far as my eye or gla&s;s could reach, not the &s;malle&s;t trace of vegetation or verdure was to be perceived, except at the we&s;t end of the fort, on the left &s;ide of the bay, where a few trees of the cocoa nut or palm kind appeared. But not|with&s;tanding the &s;terile picture it exhibits when viewed from the &s;ea, geographers, and tho&s;e who have been on &s;hore, de&s;cribe it to be, in many places, well cultivated and very fertile; producing &s;ugar canes, a little wine, &s;ome cotton, Indian corn, cocoa nuts, and oranges, with all the other tropi|cal fruits in great plenty; and point it out as a place where &s;hips, bound on long voyages, may be conveniently &s;upplied
<PB N="29" REF="45">with water, and other nece&s;&s;aries; &s;uch as fowls, goats, and hogs; all which are to be purcha&s;ed at a very ea&s;y rate.</P>
<P>20th. This evening, &s;tanding to the &s;outhward with all &s;ail; the wind moderate; the air warm and damp, with haze; the Sirius made the Alexander's &s;ignal, who had dropped con&s;iderably a&s;tern, and reprimanded the ma&s;ter for hoi&s;ting out a boat without permi&s;&s;ion. The two following days the weather was moderately warm, with &s;ome fla&s;hes of light|ning.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>23d. The weather became exceedingly dark, warm, and clo&s;e, with heavy rain; a temperature of the atmo&s;phere very common on approaching the equator, and very much to be dreaded, as the health is greatly endangered thereby. Every attention was therefore paid to the people on board the Charlotte, and every exertion u&s;ed to keep her clean and whole&s;ome between decks. My fir&s;t care was to keep the men, as far as was con&s;i&s;tent with a regular di&s;charge of their duty, out of the rain; and I never &s;uffered the con|victs to come upon deck when it rained, as they had neither linen nor clothing &s;ufficient to make them&s;elves dry and comfortable after getting wet: a line of conduct which cannot be too &s;trictly ob&s;erved, and enforced, in tho&s;e lati|tudes.
<PB N="30" REF="46">To this, and to the frequent u&s;e of oil of tar, which was u&s;ed three times a week, and oftener if found nece&s;&s;ary, I attribute, in a great degree, the uncommon good health we enjoyed. I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h oil of tar was in more gene|ral u&s;e throughout his Maje&s;ty's navy than it is. If it were, I am certain that the advantage accruing from it to the health of &s;eamen, that truly u&s;eful and valuable cla&s;s of the commu|nity, and for who&s;e pre&s;ervation too much cannot be done, would &s;oon manife&s;t it&s;elf. This efficacious remedy won|derfully re&s;i&s;ts putrefaction, de&s;troys vermin and in&s;ects of every kind; wherever it is applied overcomes all di&s;|agreeable &s;mells; and is in it&s;elf both agreeable and whole|&s;ome.</P>
<P>In the evening it became calm, with di&s;tant peals of thunder, and the mo&s;t vivid fla&s;hes of lightning I ever remember. The weather was now &s;o immoderately hot, that the female con|victs, perfectly overcome with it, frequently fainted away; and the&s;e faintings generally terminated in fits. And yet, notwith&s;tanding the enervating effects of the atmo&s;pheric heat, and the inconveniences they &s;uffered from it; &s;o pre|dominant was the warmth of their con&s;titutions, or the de|pravity of their hearts, that the hatches over the place
<PB N="31" REF="47">where they were confined could not be &s;uffered to lay off, during the night, without a promi&s;cuous intercour&s;e imme|diately taking place between them and the &s;eamen and ma|rines. What little wind there was, which was only at intervals, continuing adver&s;e, and the health of the&s;e wretches being &s;till endangered by the heat, Captain Phillip, though anxious to prevent as much as po&s;&s;ible this intercour&s;e, gave an order, on my repre&s;enting the nece&s;&s;ity of it, that a grating &s;hould be cut, &s;o as to admit a &s;mall wind &s;ail being let down among them. In &s;ome of the other &s;hips, the de&s;ire of the women to be with the men was &s;o uncontrol|lable, that neither &s;hame (but indeed of this they had long lo&s;t &s;ight), nor the fear of puni&s;hment, could deter them from making their way through the bulk heads to the apart|ments a&s;&s;igned the &s;eamen.</P>

They were, as we conjectured, in pur&s;uit of &s;ome wounded fi&s;h; and &s;o very intent were they on the object of their chace, that they pa&s;&s;ed through the fleet, and clo&s;e to &s;ome of the &s;hips, without &s;howing any di&s;po&s;ition to avoid them. The &s;ailors and mariners compared them to a nu|merous pack of hounds, &s;couring through watery ground; and indeed, when the rays of the &s;un beamed upon them, I know not what they re&s;embled more. The weather being moderate, I went round the &s;hips, and was really &s;urpri&s;ed, con&s;idering the damp and unfavourable weather we had had, to find the people look &s;o well, and to be in &s;o good a &s;tate of health.</P>

<P>The wind continuing adver&s;e, and the fleet making little progre&s;s in their voyage, Captain Phillip put the officers, &s;ea|men, marines, and convicts to an allowance of three pints of water per day (not including a quart allowed each man a day for boiling pea&s;e and oatmeal); a quantity &s;carcely &s;ufficient to &s;upply that wa&s;te of animal &s;pirits the body mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily undergo, in the torrid zone, from a con&s;tant and violent per&s;piration, and a diet con&s;i&s;ting of &s;alt provi&s;ions. Nece&s;&s;ity, however, has no law in this in&s;tance as well as in every other; and I am fully per&s;uaded the commander acted upon this occa&s;ion from the be&s;t of motives, and for the good of the whole. Were it by any means po&s;&s;ible, people &s;ubject to long voyages &s;hould never be put to a &s;hort allowance of water; for I am &s;atisfied that a liberal u&s;e of it (when freed from the foul air, and made &s;weet by a ma|chine now in u&s;e on board his Maje&s;ty's navy) will tend to prevent a &s;corbutic habit, as much, if not more, than any thing we are acquainted with. My own ex|perience in the navy has convinced me, that when &s;cor|butic
<PB N="35" REF="51">patients are re&s;trained in the u&s;e of water (which I believe is never the ca&s;e but through ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity), and they have nothing to live on but the &s;hip's provi&s;ion, the &s;urgeon's nece&s;&s;aries being ill-cho&s;en and very inadequate to the wi&s;e and &s;alutary purpo&s;es for which go|vernment intended them, all the anti&s;eptics and anti&s;corbu|tics we know of will avail very little in a di&s;ea&s;e &s;o much to be guarded again&s;t, and dreaded, by &s;eamen. In one of his Ma|je&s;ty's &s;hips, I was liberally &s;upplied with that powerful anti|&s;corbutic, e&s;&s;ence of malt; we had al&s;o &s;our krout; and be|&s;ides the&s;e, every remedy that could be compri&s;ed in the &s;mall compa&s;s of a medicine che&s;t; yet, when nece&s;&s;ity forced us to a &s;hort allowance of water, although, aware of the con&s;equence, I freely admini&s;tered the e&s;&s;ence, &amp;c. as a pre|&s;ervative, the &s;curvy made its appearance with &s;uch ha&s;ty and rapid &s;trides, that all attempts to check it proved fruitle&s;s, until good fortune threw a &s;hip in our way, who &s;pared us a &s;ufficient quantity of water to &s;erve the &s;ick with as much as they could u&s;e, and to increa&s;e the &s;hip's allowance to the &s;eamen. This fortunate and very &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply, added to the free u&s;e of the e&s;&s;ence of malt, &amp;c. which I had before
<PB N="36" REF="52">&s;trictly adhered to, made in a few days &s;o &s;udden a change for the better in the poor fellows, who had been covered with ulcers and livid blotches, that every per&s;on on board was &s;urpri&s;ed at it: and, in a fortnight after, when we got into port, there was not a man in the &s;hip, though, at the time we received the water, the gums of &s;ome of them were formed into &s;uch a fungus as nearly to envelope the teeth, but what had every appearance of health.</P>

<P>7th. Dark, cloudy, unplea&s;ant, &s;ultry weather; the wind fouth by ea&s;t. We &s;aw many fi&s;h, and caught two bonitoes. The boat&s;wain &s;truck, with a pair of grains, out of the cabin window, a mo&s;t beautiful fi&s;h, about ten pounds weight. In &s;hape it a good deal re&s;embled a &s;almon, with this differ|ence, that its tail was more forked. It was in colour of a lovely yellow; and when fir&s;t taken out of the water, it had two beautiful &s;tripes of green on each &s;ide, which, &s;ome minutes after, changed to a delightful blue, and &s;o continued. In the internal formation of this fi&s;h I ob&s;erved nothing particular, except that its heart was larger, and its re&s;pirations con|tracted and dilated longer, than I had ever &s;een before in any aquatic animal, a tortoi&s;e not excepted. As we were at a lo&s;s

In order to avoid being devoured by their pur&s;uers, they frequently &s;ought for &s;helter in the &s;hips; but much oftener flew with &s;uch force again&s;t their &s;ides as to drop lifele&s;s into the water. We caught three fine bonitoes, and thereby rid the poor flying fi&s;h, who&s;e wings &s;eemed to excite the enmity of all the larger finny race, of three formidable enemies.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>9th and 10th. Caught a great number of fi&s;h, as did the Alexander, who was near us. At night, in the wake of the &s;hip the &s;ea appeared quite luminous; a phaenomenon we attributed to the &s;pawn of the fi&s;h which &s;urrounded us on all &s;ides.</P>

<P>14th. About five in the evening we cro&s;&s;ed the equator, without any wi&s;h or inclination being &s;hewn by the &s;eamen
<PB N="38" REF="54">to ob&s;erve the ceremony u&s;ually practi&s;ed in pa&s;&s;ing under it. The longitude was 26&deg; 37&prime; W. the wind at ea&s;t, the weather moderate and clear. In lat. 1&deg; 24&prime; S. long. 26&deg; 22&prime; W. the boat&s;wain caught &s;ixteen fine bonitoes, which proved a very &s;ea&s;onable and acceptable &s;upply. At night the &s;ea, all around the &s;hip, exhibited a mo&s;t delightful &s;ight. This appearance was occa&s;ioned by the gambols of an incredible number of various kinds of fi&s;h, who &s;ported about us, and who&s;e &s;udden turnings cau&s;ed an emanation, which re&s;em|bled fla&s;hes of lightning darting in quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. What I before &s;poke of as the &s;pawn, I am now fully convinced were rather the fi&s;h them&s;elves, turning up their white bellies at &s;ome little di&s;tance below the &s;urface of the water, and the&s;e &s;udden evolutions were what gave the &s;ea the luminous appearance ob&s;erved on it before. I can the more readily affirm this to be the cau&s;e, as, one evening, when we had immen&s;e quantities about us, I carefully at|tended to them till it became dark, and was fully &s;atisfied, from the ob&s;ervations I was then able to make, that it was the fi&s;h, and not the &s;pawn, which occa&s;ioned the appear|ance; for there was not an officer or per&s;on on board but what was able very plainly to perceive their frolic&s;ome turn|ings
<PB N="39" REF="55">and windings. Indeed, &s;ome of them came &s;o near the &s;urface, that we frequently attempted to &s;trike them with a pair of grains.</P>

<P>18th. Being informed that &s;everal of the mariners and convicts on board the Alexander were &s;uddenly taken ill, I immediately vi&s;ited that &s;hip, and found that the illne&s;s complained of was wholly occa&s;ioned by the bilge water, which had by &s;ome means or other ri&s;en to &s;o great a height, that the pannels of the cabin, and the buttons on the clothes of the officers, were turned nearly black, by the noxious effluvia. When the hatches were taken off, the &s;tench was &s;o powerful, that it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to &s;tand over them. How it could have got to this height is very &s;trange; for I well know, that Captain Phillip gave &s;trict orders (which orders I my&s;elf delivered) to the ma&s;ters of the tran&s;ports to pump the &s;hips out daily, in order to keep them &s;weet and whole&s;ome; and it was added, that if the &s;hips did not make water enough for that purpo&s;e, they were to employ the convicts in throwing water into the well, and pumping it out again, until it became clear and untinged. The people's health, however, being endangered by the circum|&s;tance, I found a repre&s;entation upon the &s;ubject to Captain
<PB N="40" REF="56">Phillip needful; and accordingly went on board the Sirius for that purpo&s;e. Captain Phillip, who upon every occa&s;ion &s;howed great humanity and attention to the people, with the mo&s;t obliging readine&s;s &s;ent Mr. King, one of his lieu|tenants, on board the Alexander with me, in order to exa|mine into the &s;tate of the &s;hip; charging him, at the &s;ame time, with the mo&s;t po&s;itive and pointed in&s;tructions to the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip in&s;tantly to &s;et about &s;weetening and purifying her. This commi&s;&s;ion Mr. King executed with great propriety and expedition; and by the directions he gave, &s;uch effectual means were made u&s;e of, that the evil was &s;oon corrected: and not long after all the people, who, &s;uffering from the effects of it, were under Mr. Balmain, my a&s;&s;i&s;tant's, care, got quite rid of the complaint. I now returned to the Sirius, and &s;olicited an increa&s;e of water; which Captain Phillip with equal readine&s;s complied with; and as we had by this time got into a regular &s;outh-ea&s;t trade wind, our allowance &s;erved tolerably well; every man having three quarts a day.</P>

<P>22d. The weather moderate and cloudy, in lat 9&deg; 6&prime; S. long. 26&deg; 4&prime; W. we &s;aw a noddy and two pintado birds. At night, the commanding officer of marines having re|ceived

<P>26th. In latitude 15&deg; 18&prime; &s;outh, the Sirius made the &s;ignal for the longitude by lunar ob&s;ervation, which was found to be 29&deg; 34&prime; W. Strong breezes and cloudy weather. The Borrowdale victualler carried away her foretop-gallant-ma&s;t. This evening we ob&s;erved &s;ome flying fi&s;h, very different from tho&s;e we had before &s;een. They had wings on both the head and tail, and when in the act of flying, were &s;aid by our people to re&s;emble a double-headed &s;hot. About &s;ix o'clock the Alexander brought to, and hoi&s;ted out a boat in order to pick up a man who had fallen over board from the &s;panker boom; but, as he &s;unk before the boat could reach him, the attempt proved ineffectual.</P>

<P>30th. The Supply hailed us, and acquainted me, that a female convict, on board the Prince of Wales, had met with an accident which endangered her life. It being then nearly dark, and the &s;hips making quick way through the water, it was judged imprudent to hoi&s;t a boat out. Lieutenant Ball, of the Supply, therefore promi&s;ed to &s;end a boat early

<P>2d. Early in the morning pa&s;&s;ed and &s;poke a Portu|gueze brig &s;teering the &s;ame cour&s;e with us, which was to the coa&s;t of Brazil.

At eight in the morning &s;aw a ganet, which are &s;eldom &s;een out of &s;oundings. Being now in expectation of &s;oon &s;eeing land, the commodore made the Supply's &s;ignal to look out ahead; and the Alexander's and Prince of Wales's to take their &s;tation in the order of &s;ail|ing, being too far ahead. At three in the afternoon the Supply made the &s;ignal for &s;eeing land, which was repeated by the commodore to the convoy.

He then made the &s;ignal for the &s;hips to bring to, with their heads to the fouthward, about &s;ix miles from the &s;hore, Rio de Janeiro Sugar Loaf bearing we&s;t half north, di&s;tant about &s;ix leagues.

<P>4th. This morning, &s;tanding in for the harbour, the wind headed us; which obliged us to tack, and &s;tand out to &s;ea a little, in order to prevent our falling to leeward of the port, which it would have been no ea&s;y matter to have regained.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>5th. Still calm. This morning a boat came along&s;ide, in which were three Portugueze and &s;ix &s;laves; from whom we purcha&s;ed &s;ome oranges, plantains, and bread. In trafficking with the&s;e people, we di&s;covered, that one Thomas Barret, a convict, had, with great ingenuity and addre&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome quarter dollars which he, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two others, had
<PB N="45" REF="61">coined out of old buckles, buttons belonging to the marines, and pewter &s;poons, during their pa&s;&s;age from Teneriffe. The impre&s;&s;ion, milling, character, in a word, the whole was &s;o inimitably executed, that had their metal been a little better, the fraud, I am convinced, would have pa&s;&s;ed unde|tected. A &s;trict and careful &s;earch was made for the appa|ratus wherewith this was done, but in vain; not the &s;malle&s;t trace or ve&s;tige of any thing of the kind was to be found among them. How they managed this bu&s;ine&s;s without di&s;covery, or how they could effect it at all, is a matter of inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e to me; as they never were &s;uffered to come near a fire; and a centinel was con&s;tantly placed over their hatchway, which, one would imagine, rendered it impo&s;|&s;ible for either fire or fu&s;ed metal to be conveyed into their apartments. Be&s;ides, hardly ten minutes ever elap&s;ed, without an officer of &s;ome degree or other going down among them. The adroitne&s;s, therefore, with which they mu&s;t have managed, in order to complete a bu&s;ine&s;s that required &s;o complicated a proce&s;s, gave me a high opinion of their ingenuity, cunning, caution, and addre&s;s; and I could not help wi&s;hing that the&s;e qualities had been employed to more laudable purpo&s;es. The officers of marines, the ma&s;ter of
<PB N="46" REF="62">the &s;hip, and my&s;elf, fully explained to the injured Portu|gueze, what villians they were who had impo&s;ed upon them. We were not without apprehen&s;ions that they might entertain an unfavourable opinion of Engli&s;hmen in ge|neral from the conduct of the&s;e ra&s;cals; we therefore thought it nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint them, that the perpetrators of the fraud were felons doomed to tran&s;portation by the laws of their country, for having committed &s;imilar offences there.</P>
<P>About one o'clock a gentle breeze from the ea&s;t carried us within about a mile of the bar; where, at nine o'clock, we anchored in &s;ixteen fathom water. The calms had baffled the Supply &s;o much, that &s;he had only dropped her anchor a little while before us.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>6th. Early this morning, it being quite calm, the com|modore di&s;patched an officer to the viceroy, who met with a courteous reception, and about eleven o'clock returned with the boat nearly full of fruit and vegetables, &s;ent as pre&s;ents to the commodore from &s;ome of his old friends and acquaintance. Some years ago Captain Phillip was on this coa&s;t, commander of a Portugueze man of war. During that time he performed &s;everal gallant acts, which, aided by
<PB N="47" REF="63">his other amiable qualities, rendered him extremely popular here, and recommended him to the notice of the court of Li&s;bon. Shortly after, his own country having a claim to his &s;ervices, on the breaking out of a war, he declined a command offered him by the Portugueze, and returned to the Engli&s;h navy; where he &s;erved &s;ome time as lieutenant (a rank he had held before he had engaged in the &s;ervice of Portugal) on board the Alexander, under the command of that brave and exemplary character, Lord Longford.</P>
<P>About two o'clock we got under way, with a gentle &s;ea|breeze, which ran us into the harbour. In pa&s;&s;ing Santa Cruz fort, the commodore &s;aluted it with thirteen guns, which was returned with an equal number. This day a Portugueze &s;hip &s;ailed for Li&s;bon, which gave us an oppor|tunity of writing &s;hort letters to our friends in England.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>8th. In the forenoon, the commodore, attended by mo&s;t of the officers on the expedition, paid the viceroy a vi&s;it of ceremony. On our landing, we were received by an officer and a friar, who conducted us to the palace. As we pa&s;&s;ed the guard on duty there, the colours were laid at the feet of the commodore; than which nothing could have been a higher token of re&s;pect. We then proceeded up &s;tairs into
<PB N="48" REF="64">a large anti-chamber, crowded with officers, &s;oldiers, and do|me&s;tics. Here we were received by &s;everal officers belonging to the hou&s;ehold, and the &s;urgeon-general to the army, who &s;poke good Engli&s;h, having acquired his profe&s;&s;ional know|ledge in London. A few minutes after our arrival, a curtain, which hung over the door of the pre&s;ence-chamber, was drawn a&s;ide; and on our entrance we were individually in|troduced to the viceroy by the commodore. The ceremony being ended, and a &s;hort conver&s;ation having taken place, we were u&s;hered into another &s;pacious room, where we all &s;at down. I could not help remarking that the viceroy placed him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as to have his back turned on mo&s;t of the officers. I was told afterwards that he apo|logized for this; but I did not hear him, though very near. Neither the room we were now in, nor that into which we were fir&s;t introduced, exhibited any marks of magnificence or elegance. I acknowledge, that for my own part I was exceedingly di&s;appointed. From the parade without, &s;uch as the number of guards, &amp;c. I was led to &s;uppo&s;e that we &s;hould find every thing within the palace proportionably magnificent and princely. But this was by no means the ca&s;e. The only furniture I &s;aw in the room we were in,
<PB N="49" REF="65">except chairs, were &s;ix card tables, and portraits of two of the &s;overeigns of Portugal; one of which was that of King Seba&s;tian the Fir&s;t, the other of her pre&s;ent maje&s;ty; the former placed in the centre, the latter at the upper end of the room. The viceroy appeared to be of a middle age, &s;omewhere between forty and fifty, &s;tout and corpulent, with a &s;trong ca&s;t or defect in both his eyes. He &s;eemed to be a per&s;on of few words, but at the &s;ame time civil and attentive. I could not, however, help ob&s;erving the very great differ|ence there was between his excellency's manner and addre&s;s, and that of the elegant and accompli&s;hed Marquis de Bran|cifort.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>9th. The contract being &s;ettled, the commi&s;&s;ary &s;up|plied the troops and convicts with rice (in lieu of bread), with fre&s;h beef, vegetables, and oranges; which &s;oon re|moved every &s;ymptom of the &s;curvy prevalent among them.</P>

<P>11th. The commodore ordered &s;ix female convicts, who had behaved well, to be removed from the Friend&s;hip into the Charlotte; and at the &s;ame time an equal number, who&s;e conduct was more exceptionable, to be returned to the Friend&s;hip in their &s;tead. The commodore's view was (a matter not ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed) to &s;eparate tho&s;e who&s;e de|cent
<PB N="50" REF="66">behaviour entitled them to &s;ome favour from tho&s;e who were totally abandoned and obdurate.</P>

<P>13th. Cornelius Connell, a private in the marines, was, according to the &s;entence of a court martial, puni&s;hed with a hundred la&s;hes, for having an improper intercour&s;e with &s;ome of the female convicts, contrary to orders. Thomas Jones was al&s;o &s;entenced to receive three hundred la&s;hes, for attempting to make a centinel betray his tru&s;t, in &s;uffering him to go among the women; but in con&s;ideration of the good character he bore previous to this circum&s;tance, the court recommended him to the clemency of the commanding officer; and, in con&s;equence thereof, he was forgiven. John Jones and James Reiley, privates, accu&s;ed of &s;imilar offences to that of Connell's, were acquitted for want of evidence, there being no witne&s;&s;es to &s;upport the charge except convicts, who&s;e te&s;timony could not be admitted.</P>

<P>15th. This being a day of great parade and gaiety with the Portugueze, the inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro, arrayed in their be&s;t and riche&s;t attire, as their cu&s;tom is on regale days, began to &s;how them&s;elves, during the forenoon, be|tween the city and the church of St. Gloria, which is about a mile di&s;tant, and &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing ground near the &s;ea.
<PB N="51" REF="67">Per&s;ons of all ranks, as well in carriages as eque&s;trians and pede&s;trians, joined in the crowd; but what was the purpo&s;e of this cavalcade, or to what circum&s;tances it owed its origin, I am &s;till at a lo&s;s to know. Gloria church, which is rather neat than rich, was decorated with various flowers (in the di&s;po&s;al of which &s;ome ta&s;te was di&s;played), and mo&s;t brilliantly illuminated. I ob&s;erved that the multitude ge|nerally &s;topped here, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and employed them&s;elves in &s;ome religious ceremonies, &s;uch as praying and &s;inging hymns, before they returned to the city. This kind of parade was continued the whole day; the better &s;ort of peo|ple, however, made their appearance only in the afternoon. Returning with the re&s;t of the crowd, after it was dark, to the town, I perceived a &s;mall church, in one of the bye &s;treets, richly ornamented and elegantly illuminated. As I &s;aw men, women, and children, &s;truggling for entrance, I joined in the throng out of mere curio&s;ity, and with no little difficulty made my way in; but all the &s;atisfaction I reaped from being thus &s;queezed and jo&s;tled was, &s;eeing &s;uch as could gain admi&s;&s;ion fall on their knees, and praying with more fervor, to appearance, than real devotion. On one &s;ide of the church &s;tood a &s;habby ill-looking fellow,
<PB N="52" REF="68">&s;elling to the multitude con&s;ecrated beads; as did another, on the out&s;ide of the door. I own I could not help re|&s;embling them to mountebanks vending and di&s;tributing their no&s;trums. There were many more of the&s;e religious hawkers in the &s;treets; from &s;ome of whom, as I &s;aw it was the cu&s;tom, I purcha&s;ed a few of their beads. At a little di&s;tance from the door of the church was erected a &s;tage, on which was placed a band of vocal and in&s;trumental per|formers, who exerted them&s;elves with might and main to plea&s;e the &s;urrounding audience. I cannot, however, &s;ay that they &s;ucceeded in plea&s;ing me. About ten o'clock a di&s;play of fireworks and rockets, of which the Portugueze &s;eem to be very fond, concluded the entertainments of the day. Some intrigues, I have rea&s;on to believe, followed. I was led to this conclu&s;ion from &s;eeing many well-dre&s;&s;ed women in the crowd quite unattended; and this was the only time, during my &s;tay in the country, that I ever &s;aw any circum&s;tances which could warrant my forming &s;uch an opinion. I know it has been a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome writers, that the women of Rio de Janeiro are not uncen&s;urable in this point. They have affirmed, that as &s;oon as it became dark, the generality of them expo&s;ed them&s;elves at their doors
<PB N="53" REF="69">and windows, di&s;tingui&s;hing, by pre&s;ents of no&s;egays and flowers, tho&s;e on whom they had no objection to be&s;tow their favours; a di&s;tinction in which &s;trangers &s;hared as well as their acquaintance. That this might have been the ca&s;e I will not take upon me to deny; and, impre&s;&s;ed with the idea, on my fir&s;t arrival, I con&s;idered every woman as a proper object of gallantry; but a month's re&s;idence among them convinced me that this imputed turn for intrigue is chiefly confined to the lower cla&s;s, and that, in general, the higher ranks are as unde&s;erving of the imputation as the females of any other country.</P>
<P>The popularity of our commodore with the viceroy and principal inhabitants here, procured for the officers the liberty of going wherever they plea&s;ed. It has always been the cu&s;tom, for a &s;oldier to follow every foreign officer that landed at this port; and it was &s;carcely ever di&s;pen&s;ed with. It was, however, unknown to us; and this unaccu&s;|tomed liberty gave us an opportunity of in&s;pecting more minutely into the manners and di&s;po&s;ition of the women as well as the men.</P>

<P>21&s;t. This being the Prince of Brazil's birth-day, the commodore, with mo&s;t of his officers, went to court, to
<PB N="54" REF="70">compliment the viceroy on the occa&s;ion. As &s;oon as we landed, we were received by an officer, who conducted us to the pre&s;ence-chamber; where his excellency &s;tood under a canopy of &s;tate, receiving the compliments of the officers of the garri&s;on, the principal inhabitants, and &s;uch foreign|ers as were in the place. After having paid our re&s;pects, we withdrew, as did every other per&s;on, except the principal officers of &s;tate, &s;ome general and law officers, and tho&s;e of the governor's hou&s;ehold. The Sirius and one of the forts fired royal &s;alutes. The court was brilliant, if a place where a female does not appear can be &s;aid to be brilliant; but this, I was informed, is always the ca&s;e here. Tho&s;e gentlemen who appeared in the circle were richly and elegantly dre&s;&s;|ed. The officers of the army and of the militia were parti|cularly &s;o, and that in a &s;tile and fa&s;hion which did no &s;mall credit to their ta&s;te. The viceroy wore a &s;carlet coat trimmed with very broad rich gold lace; and his hair, according to his u&s;ual mode of wearing it, in a remarkable long queue, with very little powder; an article of dre&s;s to which I ob|&s;erved the Portugueze were not very partial; while, on the contrary, they were profu&s;e in the u&s;e of pomatum. The day ended without any other demon&s;trations of joy. As the
<PB N="55" REF="71"><MILESTONE N="September" UNIT="month"> Portugueze &s;eemed fond of fireworks and illuminations, and never fail to exhibit them on every religious fe&s;tival, we were not a little di&s;appointed in finding them omitted on the birth-day of their prince.</P>

<P>31&s;t. James Baker, a private marine, received two hun|dred la&s;hes, agreeable to the &s;entence of a court-martial, for endeavouring to get pa&s;&s;ed on &s;hore, by means of one of the &s;eamen, a &s;purious dollar, knowing it to be &s;o; and one he had undoubtedly got from &s;ome of the convicts, as it was of a &s;imilar ba&s;e metal to tho&s;e which they had coined dur|ing the pa&s;&s;age, and had attempted to put off on our fir&s;t arrival at this port.</P>

<P>September 1&s;t. Having now procured every thing at Rio de Janeiro that we &s;tood in need of, and thoroughly reco|vered and refre&s;hed our people, the commodore, with &s;uch officers of the fleet as could be &s;pared from duty, waited on the viceroy to take leave, and to return our acknowledgments for the indulgence and attention &s;hown us; which, I think we may &s;ay, we experienced in a greater extent and latitude than any foreigners had ever before done. On our landing, the &s;ame officer who had attended us upon every other pub|lic occa&s;ion, conducted us to the pre&s;ence-chamber. As we
<PB N="56" REF="72">pa&s;&s;ed, every military and public honour was paid to the commodore; the colours were laid at his feet, as they hitherto had been whenever he landed in his public cha|racter; a token of re&s;pect that is never be&s;towed on any per&s;on but the governor him&s;elf. When we arrived at the palace, an officer of the hou&s;ehold, who was waiting to re|ceive us, conducted us through a mo&s;t delightful rece&s;s, hung round with bird-cages, who&s;e inhabitants &s;eemed to vie with each other, both in the melody of their notes and the beauty of their plumage. The pa&s;&s;age we walked through was adorned on each &s;ide with odoriferous flowers, and aromatic &s;hrubs; which, while they charmed the eye, &s;pread a delightful fragrance around. This pa&s;&s;age led to a private room, on the out&s;ide of the door of which we were received by the viceroy, who &s;tood uncovered, and noticed each per&s;on &s;eparately in the mo&s;t friendly and polite man|ner. His excellency preceded us into the room, and having reque&s;ted all of us to be &s;eated, placed him&s;elf by the commodore, in a po&s;ition that fronted us. In return for our thanks and acknowledgments, he &s;aid, <Q>it gave him infinite plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction to find that the place had afforded us the &s;upplies we &s;tood in need of:</Q> to this he
<PB N="57" REF="73">added, <Q>that the attention of the inhabitants, which we were good enough to notice, was much &s;hort of his wi&s;hes.</Q> We then aro&s;e and took our leave; but not before his ex|cellency had expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of hearing from the commo|dore, with an account of his &s;ucce&s;s in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the new colony. He concluded with &s;aying, <Q>that he hoped, nay did not doubt, from the character the En|gli&s;h bore for genero&s;ity of di&s;po&s;ition, but that tho&s;e who had &s;o cheerfully engaged in a &s;ervice, &s;trange and uncer|tain in it&s;elf, would meet with an adequate reward&mdash;a recompence that every one mu&s;t allow they ju&s;tly merited.</Q> The room in which the governor received us was that wherein he u&s;ually &s;at in his retired moments. It was fur|ni&s;hed and painted in a neat and elegant &s;tile; the roof di&s;playing well-executed repre&s;entations of all the tropical fruits, and the mo&s;t beautiful birds of the country. The walls were hung round with prints, chiefly on religious &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Rio de Janeiro is &s;aid to derive its name from being di&s;|covered on St. Januarius's day. It is the capital of the Portugueze &s;ettlements in South America, and is &s;ituated on
<PB N="58" REF="74">the we&s;t &s;ide of a river, or, more properly (in my opinion), of a bay. Except that part which fronts the water, the city is &s;urrounded by high mountains, of the mo&s;t romantic form the imagination can fa&s;hion to it&s;elf any idea of. The plan on which it is built has &s;ome claim to merit. The principal &s;treet, called Strait Street, runs from the viceroy's palace, which is near the &s;outh-ea&s;t end of the town, to the north-we&s;t extremity, where it is terminated by a large convent belonging to the Benedictine friars, &s;ituated on an eminence. The &s;treet is broad, well built, and has in it a great number of hand&s;ome &s;hops. All the others are much inferior to this, being in general only wide enough to admit two carriages to pa&s;s each other in the centre. The pave|ment for foot-pa&s;&s;engers (except in Strait Street, which is without any) is &s;o very un&s;ociably narrow, that two per&s;ons cannot walk with convenience together. The hou&s;es are commonly two, and &s;ometimes three &s;tories high; of which, even though inhabited by the mo&s;t wealthy and re&s;pectable families, the lower part is always appropriated to &s;hops, and to the u&s;e of the &s;ervants and &s;laves (who are here extremely numerous), the family rather chu&s;ing to re&s;ide in the upper
<PB N="59" REF="75">part, that they might live in a le&s;s confined air. To every hou&s;e there is a balcony, with lattice-work before it; and the &s;ame before all the windows.</P>
<P>The churches are very numerous, elegant, and richly de|corated; &s;ome of them are built and ornamented in a modern &s;tile, and that in a manner which proclaims the genius, ta&s;te, and judgment of the architects and arti&s;ts. Two or three of the hand&s;ome&s;t are at this time either un|fini&s;hed or repairing; and they appear to go on but very &s;lowly, notwith&s;tanding large &s;ums are con&s;tantly collecting for their completion. As they are erected or repaired by charitable contributions, public proce&s;&s;ions are frequently made for that purpo&s;e; and the mendicant friars, belong|ing to them, likewi&s;e exert them&s;elves in their line. At the&s;e proce&s;&s;ions, which are not unfrequent, per&s;ons of every age and de&s;cription a&s;&s;i&s;t. They u&s;ually take place after it is dark, when tho&s;e who join in it are dre&s;&s;ed in a kind of cloak adapted to religious purpo&s;es, and carry a lanthorn fixed at the end of a pole of a convenient length: &s;o that upon the&s;e occa&s;ions you &s;ometimes &s;ee three or four hun|dred moving lights in the &s;treets at the &s;ame time; which has an uncommon and a plea&s;ing effect. Con&s;iderable &s;ums
<PB N="60" REF="76">are collected by this mode. At the corner of every &s;treet, about ten feet from the ground, is placed the image of a &s;aint, which is the object of the common people's adoration.</P>
<P>The town is well &s;upplied with water from the neigh|bouring mountains; which is conveyed over a deep valley by an aqueduct formed of arches of a &s;tupendous height, and from thence di&s;tributed by pipes to many parts of the city. The principal fountain is clo&s;e to the &s;ea, in a kind of &s;quare, near the palace; where &s;hips water at a good wharf, nearly in the &s;ame manner as at Teneriffe, and with equal expedition and convenience. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the fountain are cocks, from which the people in the neighbourhood are &s;upplied. This convenient and capital watering place is &s;o near the palace, that when di&s;putes or contentions ari&s;e between the boats crews of different &s;hips, the &s;laves, &amp;c. they are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and adju&s;ted by the &s;ol|diers on guard; who, in the Portugueze &s;ervice, have great power, and often treat the people with no little &s;everity.</P>
<P>While we &s;taid at this place, we made &s;everal &s;hort ex|cur&s;ions into the country; but did not go near the mines, as we knew the attempt would not only prove hazardous, but ineffectual: and as the liberty and indulgence granted
<PB N="61" REF="77">us was on the commodore's account, we never extended our trips beyond a few miles, le&s;t our doing &s;o &s;hould appear &s;u&s;picious, and reflect di&s;credit on him; we con&s;idering him in &s;ome degree re&s;pon&s;ible for our conduct. As far as we did go, we experienced the &s;ame polite and attentive beha|viour we met with from the inhabitants of the city. Never was more di&s;tingui&s;hed urbanity &s;hown to &s;trangers, than was &s;hown to us by every rank.</P>
<P>From its complicated &s;tate, I could learn but few parti|culars relative to the government of Brazil. The viceroy is inve&s;ted with great power and authority, &s;ubject in &s;ome ca&s;es to an appeal to the court of Li&s;bon; but, like a wi&s;e and prudent ruler, he &s;eldom exerts it, unle&s;s in in&s;tances where &s;ound judgment and true policy render it expedient and nece&s;&s;ary. He is a man of little parade, and appears not to be very fond of pomp and grandeur, except on public days, when it is not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with. When he goes abroad for amu&s;ement, or to take the air, his guard con&s;i&s;ts only of &s;even dragoons; but on public occa&s;ions he makes his appearance in a grander &s;tile. I once &s;aw him go in &s;tate to one of the courts of ju&s;tice; and, though it was &s;ituated not a hundred yards from his palace, he was at|tended
<PB N="62" REF="78">by a troop of hor&s;e. His &s;tate carriage is tolerably neat, but by no means elegant or &s;uperb; it was drawn by four hor&s;es irregularly mottled.</P>
<P>Carriages are pretty common at this place; there is &s;carcely a family of re&s;pectability without one. They are mo&s;tly of the chai&s;e kind, and drawn in general by mules, which are found to an&s;wer better than hor&s;es, being more indefatigable and &s;urer footed; con&s;equently better calcu|lated to a&s;cend their &s;teep hills and mountains.</P>
<P>The military force of Brazil con&s;i&s;ts of a troop of hor&s;e, which &s;erve as guards for the viceroy, twelve regiments of regulars from Europe, and &s;ix rai&s;ed in the country: the&s;e la&s;t enli&s;t men of a mixed colour, which the former are by no means &s;uffered to do. Be&s;ides the foregoing, there are twelve regiments of militia always embodied. This whole force, regulars and militia, except tho&s;e on out-po&s;ts and other needful duties, appear early in the morning, on every fir&s;t day of the month, before the palace, where they un|dergo a general mu&s;ter, and review of arms and nece&s;&s;aries. The private men, although they are con&s;idered as per&s;ons of great con&s;equence by the populace, are, on the other hand, equally &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and obedient to their officers. This &s;trict
<PB N="63" REF="79">di&s;cipline and regularity, as the city is in a great mea&s;ure under military orders, renders the inhabitants extremely civil and polite to the officers, who, in return, &s;tudy to be on the mo&s;t agreeable and happy terms with them.</P>
<P>A captain's guard (independent of the cavalry, who are always in readine&s;s to attend the viceroy) is mounted every day at the palace. Whenever Commodore Phillip pa&s;&s;ed, which he did as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible, the guard was turned out, with colours, &amp;c. and, as I before ob&s;erved, the &s;ame mark of honour paid to him as to the governor. To ob|viate this trouble and ceremony, he mo&s;t frequently landed and embarked at the north-we&s;t &s;ide of the town, where his boat con&s;tantly waited for him.</P>
<P>On both &s;ides of the river which forms the bay or har|bour, the country is picture&s;que and beautiful to a degree, abounding with the mo&s;t luxuriant flowers and aromatic &s;hrubs. Birds of a lovely and rich plumage are &s;een hop|ping from tree to tree in great numbers; together with an endle&s;s variety of in&s;ects, who&s;e exqui&s;ite beauty and gaudy colours exceed all de&s;cription. There is little appearance of cultivation in the parts we vi&s;ited; the land &s;eemed chiefly pa&s;turage. The cattle here are &s;mall, and when killed do
<PB N="64" REF="80">not produce &s;uch beef as is to be met with in England: it is not, however, by any means &s;o bad as repre&s;ented by &s;ome travellers to be; on the contrary, I have &s;een and eat here tolerably good, &s;weet, and well-ta&s;ted beef. I never &s;aw any mutton: they have indeed a few &s;heep, but they are &s;mall, thin, and lean. The gardens furni&s;h mo&s;t &s;orts of European productions, &s;uch as cabbages, lettuce, par&s;ley, leeks, white radi&s;hes, beans, pea&s;e, kidney beans, turnips, water melons, excellent pumpkins, and pine-apples of a &s;mall and indifferent kind. The country likewi&s;e pro|duces, in the mo&s;t unbounded degree, limes, acid and &s;weet lemons, oranges of an immen&s;e &s;ize and exqui&s;ite flavour, plantains, bananas, yams, cocoa-nuts, ca&s;hoo apples and nuts, and &s;ome mangos. For the u&s;e of the &s;laves and poorer &s;ort of people, the capado is cultivated in great plenty; but this cannot be done through a want of corn for bread, as I never &s;aw finer flour than at this place, which is plentiful, and remarkably cheap.</P>
<P>Brazil, particularly towards the northern parts, furni&s;hes a number of excellent drugs. In the &s;hops of the druggi&s;ts and apothecaries of Rio de Janeiro, of which there are many, hippo, oil of ca&s;tor, bal&s;am capiva, with mo&s;t of the valu|able
<PB N="65" REF="81">gums, and all of an excellent quality, are to be found; but they are &s;old at a much dearer rate than could po&s;&s;ibly have been conceived or expected in a country of which they are the natural produce.</P>
<P>The riches of this country, ari&s;ing from the mines, are certainly very great. To go near, or to get a &s;ight of the&s;e inexhau&s;tible trea&s;uries, is impo&s;&s;ible, as every pa&s;s leading to them is &s;trongly guarded; and even a per&s;on taken on the road, unle&s;s he be able to give a clear and unequivocal account of him&s;elf and his bu&s;ine&s;s, is impri&s;oned, and per|haps compelled ever after to work in tho&s;e &s;ubterraneous cavities, which avarice, or an ill-timed and fatal curio&s;ity, may have prompted him to approach. The&s;e circum&s;tances made a trial to &s;ee them without permi&s;&s;ion (and that per|mi&s;&s;ion I under&s;tand has never been granted the mo&s;t fa|voured foreigners) too dangerous to be attempted.</P>
<P>In addition to the above &s;ource of wealth, the country produces excellent tobacco, and likewi&s;e &s;ugar canes, from which the inhabitants make good &s;ugar, and draw a &s;pirit called <HI>aquadente.</HI> This &s;pirit, by proper management, and being kept till it is of a proper age, becomes tolerable rum. As it is &s;old very cheap, the commodore purcha&s;ed a
<PB N="66" REF="82">hundred pipes of it for the u&s;e of the garri&s;on when arrived at New South Wales. Precious and valuable &s;tones are al&s;o found here. Indeed they are &s;o very plenty, that a certain quantity only is &s;uffered to be collected annually. At the jewellers and lapidaries, of which occupation there are many in Rio, I &s;aw &s;ome valuable diamonds, and a great number of excellent topazes, with many other &s;orts of &s;tones of inferior value. Several topazes were purcha&s;ed by my&s;elf and others; but we cho&s;e to buy them wrought, in order to avoid impo&s;ition, which is not unfrequent when the &s;tones are &s;old in a rough &s;tate. One of the principal &s;treets of this city is nearly occupied by jewellers and the workers of the&s;e &s;tones; and I ob&s;erved that per&s;ons of a &s;imilar profe&s;&s;ion generally re&s;ided in the &s;ame &s;treet.</P>
<P>The manufactures here are very few, and tho&s;e by no means exten&s;ive. All kinds of European goods &s;ell at an immoderate price, notwith&s;tanding the &s;hops are well &s;tored with them.</P>
<P>The Brazil, or native Indians, are very adroit at making elegant cotton hammocks of various dyes and forms. It was formerly the cu&s;tom for the principal people of Rio to be carried about in the&s;e hammocks; but that fa&s;hion is &s;uc|ceeded by the u&s;e of &s;edan chairs, which are now very com|mon
<PB N="67" REF="83">among them; but they are of a more clum&s;y form than tho&s;e u&s;ed in England. The chair is &s;u&s;pended from an aukward piece of wood, borne on the &s;houlders of two &s;laves, and elevated &s;ufficiently to be clear of the inequalities of the &s;treet. In carrying, the foremo&s;t &s;lave takes the pavement, and the other the &s;treet, one keeping a little be|fore the other; &s;o that the chair is moved forward in a &s;idelong direction, and very unlike the procedure of the London chairmen. The&s;e fellows, who get on at a great rate, never take the wall of the foot-pa&s;&s;engers, nor incom|mode them in the &s;malle&s;t degree.</P>
<P>The inhabitants in general are a plea&s;ant, cheerful people, inclining more to corpulency than tho&s;e of Portugal; and, as far as we could judge, very favourably inclined to the Engli&s;h. The men are &s;trait and well-proportioned. They do not accu&s;tom them&s;elves to high living, nor indulge much in the juice of the grape.</P>
<P>The women, when young, are remarkably thin, pale, and delicately &s;haped; but, after marriage, they generally in|cline to be lu&s;ty, without lo&s;ing that con&s;titutional pale, or rather &s;allow appearance. They have regular and better teeth than are u&s;ually ob&s;ervable in warm climates, where
<PB N="68" REF="84">&s;weet productions are plentiful. They have likewi&s;e the mo&s;t lovely, piercing, dark eyes; in the captivating u&s;e of which they are by no means un&s;killed. Upon the whole, the women of this country are very engaging; and rendered more &s;o by their free, ea&s;y, and unre&s;trained manner. Both &s;exes are extremely fond of &s;uffering their hair, which is black, to grow to a prodigious length. The ladies wear it plaited, and tied up in a kind of club, or large lump; a mode of hair-dre&s;&s;ing that does not &s;eem to corre&s;pond with their delicate and feminine appearance. Cu&s;tom, however, reconciles us to the mo&s;t <HI>outr&eacute;</HI> fa&s;hions; and what we thought unbecoming, the Portugueze con&s;idered as highly ornamental. I was one day at a gentleman's hou&s;e, to whom I expre&s;&s;ed my wonder at the prodigious quantity of hair worn by the ladies; adding, that I did not conceive it po&s;|&s;ible for it to be all of their own growth. The gentleman a&s;&s;ured me that it was; and, in order to convince me that it was &s;o, he called his wife, and untied her hair, which, notwith&s;tanding it was in plaits, dragged at lea&s;t two inches upon the floor as &s;he walked along. I offered my &s;ervice to tie it up again; which was politely accepted, and con|&s;idered as a compliment by both. It has been &s;aid that
<PB N="69" REF="85">the Portugueze are a jealous people; a di&s;po&s;ition I never could perceive among any of tho&s;e with whom I had the plea&s;ure of forming an acquaintance; on the contrary, they &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of, and plea&s;ed with, every kind of attention paid to their wives or daughters.</P>
<P>The current coin here is the &s;ame as that in Portugal, but &s;ilver as well as gold is coined at this place, where they have an e&s;tabli&s;hed mint. The pieces of gold are of various &s;izes, and have marked on them the number of thou&s;and rees they are worth. The mo&s;t common coin is a 4000 ree piece, which pa&s;&s;es for &pound;. 1.2.6, though not &s;o heavy as an Engli&s;h guinea. The &s;ilver pieces, called petacks, value two &s;hillings, are al&s;o marked with the number of rees they are worth. You get ten of the&s;e in exchange for a guinea; and for a Spani&s;h dollar two petacks, five vintins and a half, which is about four &s;hillings and eight-pence. Here, as in Portugal, they have five, ten, and twenty thou&s;and ree pieces. A ree is a nominal coin; twenty make a vintin, value about three half-pence; eight vintins make one &s;hil|ling; a petack is worth two &s;hillings, and of the&s;e there are &s;ome double pieces, value four &s;hillings &s;terling.</P>
<P>One morning, as I attended Mr. Il de Fon&s;o, &s;urgeon ge|neral
<PB N="70" REF="86">to the army, and a man of ingenuity and abilities in his profe&s;&s;ion, to a large public ho&s;pital, a &s;oldier was brought in with a wound in his left &s;ide. The in&s;trument had penetrated the abdomen, without injuring the inte&s;|tines; and from its form and nature the wound mu&s;t have been inflicted with the point of a knife, or a &s;tiletto. The patient, after being dre&s;&s;ed, acquainted us, that the preced|ing night he had had &s;ome words with another man about a woman; who, notwith&s;tanding blows had not pa&s;&s;ed, &s;tab|bed him with &s;ome &s;harp in&s;trument, of what kind he could not &s;ee, as it was then dark, and afterwards made his e&s;cape. This account led me to believe that a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations were not unfrequent in Brazil; but Mr. Il de Fon&s;o a&s;&s;ured me to the contrary; telling me that &s;uch in&s;tances &s;eldom happened, except among the negroes, who&s;e vindictive and treacherous di&s;po&s;itions led them wonderful lengths to gratify their revenge, whenever night and a convenient opportunity con&s;pired, at once to aid and to conceal their horrid acts.</P>
<P>While we remained here, the weather being cool and favourable, I prevailed on the &s;urgeon who was about to amputate a limb, to allow me to take it off according to
<PB N="71" REF="87">Allen&s;on's method. During the operation I could plainly &s;ee, that he and his pupils did not &s;eem much plea&s;ed with it; and he afterwards told me it was impo&s;&s;ible it could ever an&s;wer. A very &s;hort &s;pace of time, however, made them of a different opinion; and in eighteen days after, when we &s;ailed, I had the &s;atisfaction to leave the patient with his &s;tump nearly cicatrized, to the no &s;mall joy of the &s;urgeon, who &s;aid, that if the man had died, he &s;hould have been heavily cen&s;ured for making him the &s;ubject of experi|ments. The circum&s;tance of a man's leg being cut off, and almo&s;t healed in as many days as it generally takes weeks, &s;oon became known, and added very much to the e&s;tima|tion in which the people of this place held Engli&s;h &s;urgeons. Whenever I vi&s;ited the ho&s;pital afterwards, the objects of pity with which it was filled, u&s;ed to crowd around me in &s;uch a manner, and in &s;uch numbers, for my advice, that I found it difficult to get from them. And they now would readily have &s;ubmitted to any operation I &s;hould have propo&s;ed; but as I &s;aw the &s;urgeon did not much approve of my inter|ference, I gave up all ideas of it.</P>
<P>The harbour of Rio de Janeiro lies in 22&deg; 54&prime; &s;outh lati|tude, and 43&deg; 19&prime; we&s;t longitude, about eighteen or twenty
<PB N="72" REF="88">leagues to the we&s;tward of Cape Frio. The entrance is good, and cannot be mi&s;taken, on account of a remarkable hill, re&s;embling a &s;ugar loaf, that is on the left hand &s;ide; and &s;ome i&s;lands before it, one of which is oblong, and does not, at &s;ome di&s;tance, look unlike a thatched hou&s;e: they lie from the mouth of the harbour S. by W. about two leagues. Ships going in may run on either &s;ide. The bar, over which we carried &s;even fathom water, is not more than three|fourths of a mile acro&s;s, and well defended by forts. The &s;tronge&s;t is called Santa Cruz, built on a rock, on the &s;tar|board &s;ide as you run in, from which every &s;hot fired at &s;hips pa&s;&s;ing mu&s;t take effect. The other, named Fort Lozia, is &s;maller, and built on an i&s;land or rock, on the larboard &s;ide, a little higher up, and lying contiguous to the main land. The tide in the harbour rarely ebbs and flows more than &s;even feet; however, &s;hips, if po&s;&s;ible, never anchor in this narrow pa&s;s between the forts, as the bottom is foul, and the tide runs with con&s;iderable rapidity. All danger in going in, or running out, may be avoided by keeping the mid channel, or a little bordering on the &s;tarboard &s;hore. After Santa Cruz fort is pa&s;&s;ed, the cour&s;e is nearly N. by W. and N. N. W.; but, as I before ob&s;erved, the eye is the be&s;t
<PB N="73" REF="89">pilot. When you get within a mile of a &s;trong fortified i&s;land which lies before the town (only &s;eparated by a nar|row pa&s;s), called the I&s;le of Cobras, you are then in the great road; where we anchored in fifteen fathom water; or, &s;hould you have occa&s;ion to get nearer the town, you may run round this i&s;land, on the north &s;ide, and anchor above it, before the convent of Benedictine friars at the N. W. end of the city, before &s;poken of.</P>
<P>The city and harbour are &s;trongly defended and fortified, but with very little judgment or regularity. The hills are very high, and &s;o is the coa&s;t, which has &s;uch &s;trange, romantic, and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible terminations, that nature of her own accord, without the aid of military &s;kill, &s;eems di&s;po&s;ed to defend them. Taking every thing into the account, I think it one of the be&s;t harbours I have ever &s;een; and, upon the whole, better calculated to &s;upply the wants of people who have long been at &s;ea, and &s;tand in need of refre&s;hment, than any part of the world, every thing being &s;o remarkably cheap. Beef may be purcha&s;ed at &s;even farthings per pound; hogs, turkeys, and ducks, both Engli&s;h and Mu&s;covy, were equally rea&s;onable. Fowls were dearer, but &s;till &s;old at a lower rate than in England. Fi&s;h
<PB N="74" REF="90">was not very plentiful, but I was told, that at other &s;ea&s;ons they have a mo&s;t excellent market for that article. Their market for vegetables, however, abounded with fruit, roots, and garden &s;tuff, of every kind, notwith&s;tanding it was not the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for fruit, it then being too early in the &s;pring to expect abundance. Oranges, which we had in the greate&s;t plenty, co&s;t only five-pence the hundred.</P>
<P>On a hill, about half a mile S. E. of the city, &s;tands a con|vent, named Convento de Santa There&s;a; the nuns of which, amounting to about forty, are not allowed to unveil when they come to the grate: and on a plain between this con|vent and the city, &s;tands another, called Convento A. de Juda, a very large building, governed by an abbe&s;s and &s;e|veral nuns, all under the direction of a bi&s;hop. Here about &s;eventy young ladies are placed to be educated, who are &s;ubject to all the re&s;trictions of a mona&s;tic life, only they are permitted to be frequently at the grate, and that unveiled. But what is &s;ingular, the nuns of this convent, when they arrive at a proper age, are allowed either to take a hu&s;band, or to take the veil, ju&s;t as their inclination leads. They are not however &s;uffered to quit the convent on any other terms than that of marriage; to which the con&s;ent and approba|tion
<PB N="75" REF="91">of the bi&s;hop is always nece&s;&s;ary. If they do not get a hu&s;band early in life, it is common for them to take the veil. Many of the&s;e young ladies were very agreeable both in per&s;on and di&s;po&s;ition; and by frequently conver&s;ing with them at the grate, we formed as tender an inter|cour&s;e with them as the bolts and bars between us would admit of. My&s;elf, and two other gentlemen belonging to the fleet, &s;ingled out three of tho&s;e who appeared to be the mo&s;t free and lively, to whom we attached our&s;elves during our &s;tay, making them &s;uch pre&s;ents as we thought would prove mo&s;t acceptable, and receiving more valuable ones in return. The&s;e little attentions were viewed by them in &s;o favourable a light, that when we took a la&s;t farewel they gave us many evident proofs of their concern and regret. Indeed every circum&s;tance while we continued at this charming place (except there being no inns or coffee-hou&s;es, where a &s;tranger could refre&s;h him&s;elf, or be accommodated when he cho&s;e to &s;tay a night or two on &s;hore) con&s;pired to make us plea&s;ed and delighted with it; and I can truly &s;ay, that I left it with reluctance, which I believe was the ca&s;e with many of my companions.</P>

<P>16th. Commodore Phillip, attended by mo&s;t of the officers of the fleet, paid a complimentary vi&s;it to his excel|lency
<PB N="80" REF="96">Mynheer Van Graaf, the Dutch governor, by whom we were received with extreme civility and politene&s;s. A few hours after we had taken leave, he called on the commodore at his lodgings, to return his vi&s;it; and the next day re|turned the vi&s;it of &s;uch officers, re&s;iding on &s;hore, as had paid their re&s;pects to him.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this &s;tudied politene&s;s, &s;everal days elap&s;ed before the commodore could obtain a categorical an|&s;wer to the requi&s;ition he had made for the &s;upplies he &s;tood in need of for the expedition: and had it not been for the judicious per&s;everance Commodore Phillip ob&s;erved, in urg|ing his particular &s;ituation, and the uncommon exigency of the &s;ervice he was engaged in; it was believed the governor, fi&s;cal, and council, would have &s;heltered their refu&s;al under the pretence that a great &s;carcity had prevailed in the Cape colony the preceding &s;ea&s;on, particularly of wheat and corn, which were the articles we &s;tood mo&s;t in want of. This idea they wi&s;hed to impre&s;s us with; but, as ju&s;t ob&s;erved, the commodore's &s;agacity and indu&s;trious zeal for the &s;ervice &s;ubdued and got over the &s;upinene&s;s &s;hown by the governor, &amp;c. and procured permi&s;&s;ion for the contractor to &s;upply us with as much &s;tock, corn, and other nece&s;&s;aries, as we could
<PB N="81" REF="97">&s;tow. It is, however, much to be lamented that the quantity we could find room for fell very &s;hort of what we ought to have taken in; as the only &s;pare room we had, was what had been occa&s;ioned by the con&s;umption of provi&s;ions, &amp;c. &s;ince we left Rio de Janeiro, and the removal of twenty female convicts from the Friend&s;hip into the Charlotte, the Lady Pen|rhyn, and the Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>After the &s;upplies had been granted, his excellency Governor Graaf invited the commodore, and many of the officers of the expedition, to a very hand&s;ome dinner at his town re&s;idence. The hou&s;e at which we were entertained, is delightfully &s;ituated, nearly in the centre of an exten&s;ive garden, the property of the Dutch Ea&s;t India company, u&s;efully planted, and at the &s;ame time elegantly laid out. The governor's family make what u&s;e they plea&s;e of the produce of the garden, which is various and abundant; but the original intention of the company in appropriating &s;o exten&s;ive a piece of ground to this purpo&s;e was, that their ho&s;pital, which is generally pretty full when their &s;hips arrive after long voyages, may be well &s;upplied with fruits and vegeta|bles, and likewi&s;e that their &s;hips may receive a &s;imilar &s;upply.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="98">This garden is as public as St. James's park; and, for its hand&s;ome, plea&s;ant, and well-&s;haded walks, is much fre|quented by per&s;ons of every de&s;cription, but particularly by the fa&s;hionable and gay. There are many other agreeable walks about Cape Town, but none to be compared with the&s;e. At the upper end of the principal of them is a &s;mall &s;pace walled in for the purpo&s;e of confining &s;ome large o&s;triches, and a few deer. A little to the right of this is a &s;mall menagery, in which the company have half a dozen wild animals, and about the &s;ame number of curious birds.</P>
<P>As you approach the Cape of Good Hope, a very re|markable mountain may, in clear weather, be di&s;covered at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; it is called the Table Land, from its flat &s;urface, which re&s;embles that piece of furniture. Mr. Dawes, lieutenant of marines on board the Sirius, an ingenious and accurate ob&s;erver, who has undertaken during the voyage the a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations; accompanied by Me&s;&s;rs. Fowell and Waterhou&s;e, mid&s;hipmen of the Sirius; Lieutenant De Witt, of the Dutch navy; and my&s;elf, went to the top of this mountain; an undertaking which we found to be of a far more &s;erious nature than we at fir&s;t were aware of. For my own part, I &s;uffered &s;o much from heat
<PB N="83" REF="99">and thir&s;t, that had not the fear of &s;hame urged me on, my companions being determined to accompli&s;h it at all events, I &s;hould mo&s;t certainly have given it up, before I reached the top. During this &s;ultry and fatiguing expedition, I found great benefit, towards alleviating my thir&s;t, by keep|ing a &s;mall pebble in my mouth; and &s;ometimes by chewing ru&s;hes, which we met with in our way. But, when we had reached the &s;ummit, the delightful and exten&s;ive pro&s;pect we there enjoyed, the weather being uncommonly fine, fully atoned for the trouble, fatigue, and every &s;uffering, we had undergone. From this elevation we could overlook all the country about the Cape.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we got to the top, our fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s was to look out for water; but all we could find was &s;ome &s;tagnant rain, which lay in the hollow of the &s;tones. Our thir&s;t, however, was &s;o intolerable, that the di&s;covery even of this gave us inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure; and, notwith&s;tanding we all per&s;pired mo&s;t violently, and were &s;en&s;ible of the danger and impropriety of drinking a quantity of bad water in &s;uch a &s;ituation, yet we could not refrain. As for my own part, it was utterly out of my power to li&s;ten at that time to the dictates of prudence; and I believe it was equally difficult
<PB N="84" REF="100">to my companions, if I might judge from the avidity with which they drank out of the little pools, lying on the ground at full length, that being the only po&s;ture in which it was to be obtained.</P>
<P>The regularity of the &s;treets of the town, which inter&s;ect each other at right angles; the buildings, gardens, ca&s;tle, and forts; with twenty-three &s;hips then at anchor in the bay; all which appeared directly underneath us; was a &s;ight beautiful and plea&s;ing beyond de&s;cription. The per|pendicular height of this land is 1857 feet from the &s;urface of the water. On the top of it we gathered &s;everal &s;pecies of heath, &s;ome wild celery, a few &s;hrubs, and &s;ome non-de&s;cript plants; we found al&s;o &s;ome little &s;tones of a fine poli&s;h and &s;ingular whitene&s;s.</P>
<P>In our de&s;cent, which proved nearly as difficult and trou|ble&s;ome as going up, we &s;aw &s;ome runaway negroes, round a fire, on the clift of a &s;tupendous rock, where it was en|tirely out of the power of their owners to get at them. To look at their &s;ituation, one would think it beyond the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of human ingenuity to devi&s;e a way to reach it. Here they remain all day in perfect &s;ecurity, and during the night make frequent excur&s;ions to the town and the parts
<PB N="85" REF="101">adjacent, committing great depredations on the inhabitants. The whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the&s;e fugitives depends on this precarious method: and even this method would prove in|&s;ufficient, were it not for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they receive from tho&s;e who were once their fellow &s;laves. Nor is it always that they &s;ucceed in the depredatory trips, which nece&s;&s;ity thus urges them to take; they are often betrayed by their quondam friends; and when this happens, as the Dutch are not famed for their lenity in puni&s;hing crimes, they are made horrid examples of. But neither the fear of pu|ni&s;hment, nor hunger, thir&s;t, cold, and wretchedne&s;s, to which they are often unavailably expo&s;ed, can deter them from making Table Land their place of refuge from what they con&s;ider to be greater evils. Scarcely a day pa&s;&s;es but a &s;moke may be &s;een from &s;ome of the&s;e inacce&s;&s;ible re|treats.</P>
<P>In the mild or &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, which commences in Sep|tember, and continues till March, the Table Land is &s;ome|times &s;uddenly capped with a white cloud, by &s;ome called the <HI>&s;preading of the Table-cloth.</HI> When this cloud &s;eems to roll down the &s;teep face of the mountain, it is an unerring indication of an approaching gale of wind from the &s;outh-ea&s;t;
<PB N="86" REF="102">which generally blows with great violence, and &s;ome|times continues a day or more, but in common is of &s;hort duration. On the fir&s;t appearance of this cloud, the &s;hips in Table Bay begin to prepare for it, by &s;triking yards and top-ma&s;ts, and making every thing as &s;nug as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>A little to the we&s;tward of the Table Land, divided by a &s;mall valley, &s;tands, on the right hand &s;ide of Table Bay, a round hill, called the Sugar Loaf; and by many the Lion's Head, as there is a continuance from it contiguous to the &s;ea, called the Lion's Rump; and when you take a general view of the whole, it very much re&s;embles that animal with his head erect. The Sugar Loaf or Lion's Head, and the Lion's Rump, have each a flag-&s;taff on them, by which the approach of &s;hips is made known to the governor, par|ticularizing their number, nation, and the quarter from which they come. To the ea&s;tward, &s;eparated by a &s;mall cha&s;m from the Table Land, &s;tands Charles's Mount, well known by the appellation of the Devil's Tower; and &s;o called from the violent gu&s;ts of wind &s;uppo&s;ed to i&s;&s;ue from it, when it partakes of the cap that covers the Table Land; though the&s;e gu&s;ts are nothing more than a degree of force the wind acquires in coming through the cha&s;m. When
<PB N="87" REF="103">this phaenomenon appears in the morning, which is by no means &s;o frequent as in the evening, the &s;ailors have a &s;aying, as the Devil's Tower is almo&s;t contiguous to the Table Land, that the old gentleman is going to breakfa&s;t; if in the middle of the day, that he is going to dinner; and if in the evening, that the cloth is &s;pread for &s;upper.</P>
<P>The foregoing high lands form a kind of amphitheatre about the Table Valley, where the Cape Town &s;tands. From the &s;hipping the town appears plea&s;antly &s;ituated, but at the &s;ame time &s;mall; a deception that ari&s;es from its being built in a valley with &s;uch &s;tupendous mountains directly behind it. On landing, however, you are &s;urpri&s;ed, and agreeably di&s;appointed, to find it not only exten&s;ive, but well built, and in a good &s;tile; the &s;treets &s;pacious, and inter&s;ecting each other at right angles with great preci&s;ion. This exact|ne&s;s in the formation of the &s;treets, when viewed from the Table Land, is ob&s;erved to be very great. The hou&s;es in ge|neral are built of &s;tone, cemented together with a glutinous kind of earth which &s;erves as mortar, and afterwards neatly pla&s;tered, and whitewa&s;hed, with lime. As to their height, they do not in common exceed two &s;tories, on account of the violence of the wind, which at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons of the year
<PB N="88" REF="104">blows with great &s;trength and fury; indeed &s;ometimes &s;o violently as to &s;hake the hou&s;es to the very foundation. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, thatch has been u&s;ually preferred to tiles or &s;hingles; but the bad effects that have proceeded from this mode when fires happen, has induced the inhabi|tants in all their new buildings to give the preference to &s;lates and tiles. The lower parts of the hou&s;es, according to the cu&s;tom of the Dutch nation, are not only uncommonly neat and clean in appearance, but they are really &s;o; and the furniture is rather rich than elegant. But this is by no means the ca&s;e with the bed-rooms or upper apartments; which are more barely and wor&s;e furni&s;hed than any I ever beheld: and the &s;treets &s;eem to be much upon a par with them, they being rough, uneven, and unpaved. I was, however, upon the whole, extremely well plea&s;ed with the town. Many of the hou&s;es have a &s;pace flagged before the door, and others have trees planted before them, which form a plea&s;ant &s;hade, and give plea&s;ing novelty to the &s;treets.</P>
<P>The only landing-place is at the ea&s;t end of the town, where there is a wooden quay running &s;ome paces into the &s;ea, with &s;everal cranes on it, for the convenience of loading and unloading the &s;coots that come along &s;ide. To
<PB N="89" REF="105">this place excellent water is conveyed by pipes, which makes the watering of &s;hips both ea&s;y and expeditious.</P>
<P>Clo&s;e to this quay, on the left hand, &s;tands the ca&s;tle and principal fortre&s;s; a &s;trong exten&s;ive work, having excellent accommodations for the troops, and for many of the civil officers belonging to the company. Within the gates, the company have their principal &s;tores; which are &s;pa|cious as well as convenient. This fort covers and defends the ea&s;t part of the town and harbour, as Am&s;terdam fort does the we&s;t part. The latter, which has been built &s;ince commo|dore John&s;tone's expedition, and whereon both French and Dutch judgment have been united to render it effectual and &s;trong, is admirably planned and calculated to annoy and hara&s;s &s;hips coming into the bay. Some &s;maller de|tached fortifications extend along the coa&s;t, both to the ea&s;t and we&s;t, and make landing, which was not the ca&s;e before the late war, hazardous and difficult. In a word, Cape Town is at this time fortified with &s;trength, regularity, and judgment.</P>
<P>There are two churches here; one large, plain, and unadorned, for the Calvini&s;ts, the prevailing &s;ect; and a &s;maller one for the Lutherans.</P>
<P>The ho&s;pital, which is large and exten&s;ive, is &s;ituated
<PB N="90" REF="106">at the upper end of the town, clo&s;e to the company's garden. It is an honour to that commercial body, and no &s;mall orna|ment to the town. The only objection that can be made to it as a building, is its &s;ituation: had it been erected on an eminence, and a little detached from the town, which might ea&s;ily have been done, no fault could have been found with it. As it is, the convale&s;cents have free acce&s;s to the com|pany's gardens, where they reap the benefit of a whole&s;ome pure air, perfumed with the exhalations of a great variety of rich fruit trees, aromatic &s;hrubs, and odorous plants and flowers; and likewi&s;e have the u&s;e of every production of it, as before ob&s;erved; advantages that compen&s;ate, in a great mea&s;ure, for the flat &s;ituation of the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are all exceedingly fond of gardens, which they keep in mo&s;t excellent order. The doing this is very little trouble to them, the climate and &s;oil being mo&s;t benign and friendly to vegetation. Among the many which afforded me delight, I mu&s;t not forget that belonging to Coloned Gordon, commander in chief of the Dutch troops at the Cape; where not only the ta&s;te and inge|nuity of the gardener, but the &s;kill and knowledge of the botani&s;t, are at once manife&s;t. The colonel is a man of &s;cience, of an active and well-cultivated genius, and who
<PB N="91" REF="107">appropriates tho&s;e hours he can &s;pare from his military duties (in which he is &s;aid to excel), to a peru&s;al of the book of nature, and re&s;earches after u&s;eful knowledge. The&s;e pur&s;uits tend not only to this amu&s;ement, but to his honour; and they will, doubtle&s;s, at &s;ome time or other, further conduce to the advancement of natural hi&s;tory, and to the honour of his country; as it is &s;aid he intends to publi&s;h the ob&s;ervations and remarks which have been the re&s;ult of his re&s;earches. Tho&s;e he has made on the Hotten|tots, Caffres, and the countries they inhabit, will doubt|le&s;sly be valuable; he having made him&s;elf better acquainted with the &s;ubject, and penetrated farther into the interior parts, than any traveller or naturali&s;t that has hitherto vi&s;ited the Cape. It is to be lamented, that he has &s;o long withheld from the world the gratification and improvement, which mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly mu&s;t be derived from the ob&s;ervations of a per&s;on &s;o well and &s;o exten&s;ively informed. His polite attention and civility, during our &s;tay at the Cape, claim our mo&s;t grateful acknowledgments.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides their ho&s;pital, the Dutch Ea&s;t India company have &s;everal other public buildings, which tend to improve the appearance of the town. The two principal of the&s;e
<PB N="92" REF="108">are, the &s;tables, and a hou&s;e for their &s;laves. The former is a hand&s;ome range of buildings, capable of containing an incredible number of hor&s;es. Tho&s;e they have at the Cape are &s;mall, &s;pirited, and full of life. The latter is a building of con&s;iderable extent, where the &s;laves, both male and female, have &s;eparate apartments, in a very comfortable &s;tile, to re&s;ide in after the fatigues and toil of the day; which undoubtedly is great, but by no means equal, in my opinion, to that endured by the &s;laves in our own colonies. How|ever &s;evere and cruel the Dutch may be con&s;idered in other re&s;pects, they certainly treat their &s;laves with great humanity and kindne&s;s; which, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, I &s;carcely ever &s;aw done in the We&s;t Indies, during a re&s;idence there of three years. On the contrary, I have frequently been witne&s;s to the in|fliction of the mo&s;t brutal, cruel, and wanton puni&s;hments on the&s;e poor creatures, who are the &s;ource and immediate &s;up|port of the &s;plendour of the Creoles. The bare retro&s;pect of the cruelties I have &s;een exerci&s;ed there, excites a kind of hor|ror that chills my blood. At the Cape, there are &s;everal officers placed over the &s;laves, who have commodious apart|ments, and treat them humanely.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t week after our arrival at this place, the militia,
<PB N="93" REF="109">con&s;i&s;ting both of hor&s;e and foot, were embodied, and held their annual meeting: I &s;ay annual, as that is the u&s;ual period; but this was the fir&s;t time of their a&s;&s;embling &s;ince the conclu&s;ion of the war in 1783. The Cape militia differ from the Engli&s;h, in not receiving pay, or wearing regimentals. In fact they &s;hould rather be called volunteers, who turn out for the protection of their own property, and are not &s;ubject to &s;trict military di&s;cipline. Mo&s;t of them wore blue coats, with white metal buttons, aukwardly long, and in the cut and &s;hape of which uniformity had not been attended to. Neither was it vi&s;ible in the other parts of their dre&s;s or accoutrements; &s;ome wore powder, others none; &s;o that, upon the whole, they made a very unmilitary appearance. The officers are cho&s;en annually from among them&s;elves. Some of the&s;e, indeed, I ob&s;erved to be very well dre&s;&s;ed. Neglect, non-attendance, and every other breach of their military rules, is puni&s;hed by fine or forfeiture, and not corporally. At this burle&s;que on the profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;oldier, I could not help ob&s;erving, that many of them had either got intoxicated that morning, or were not recovered from their overnight's debauch; notwith&s;tanding which they marched to the field, and went through their evolutions
<PB N="94" REF="110">with a &s;teadine&s;s and regularity that was really a&s;toni&s;hing, con&s;idering the &s;tate they were in: but it is &s;aid, and I believe with &s;ome truth, that a Dutchman, when half drunk, is more capable of performing every kind of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, than if he were perfectly &s;ober. After the&s;e annual exhibitions, the members of the corps meet their wives, daughters, &amp;c. (who take care to be pre&s;ent, that they may be witne&s;&s;es of their military &s;kill and atchievements) at &s;ome friend's hou&s;e, where they crown the night in dancing, of which they are uncommonly fond. To danc|ing are added &s;ub&s;tantial &s;uppers, and potent libations; in which they indulge not only upon this, but on all other occa&s;ions. A Dutch &s;upper to me, at fir&s;t, was a matter of wonder, as I could never &s;ee any kind of differ|ence, either in the quality or quantity, between them and their dinners, which were always abundant, and con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of heavy food.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the Cape, though in their per&s;ons large, &s;lout, and athletic, have not all that phlegm about them which is the characteri&s;tic of Dutchmen in general. The phy&s;ical influence of climate may in &s;ome degree account for this; for it is well known that in all
<PB N="95" REF="111">&s;outhern latitudes the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the people are more gay, and that they are more inclined to luxury and amu&s;ements of every kind, than the inhabitants of the northern hemi&s;phere.</P>
<P>The ladies at the Cape are lively, good natured, fami|liar, and gay. They re&s;emble the women of England more than any foreigners I have ever &s;een. Engli&s;h fa&s;hions prevail among them (the female part of the governor's family excepted, who imitate the French), notwith&s;tanding their intercour&s;e with France is now by far greater than with England. The habits and cu&s;toms of the women of this place are extremely contra&s;ted to tho&s;e of the inhabit|ants of Rio de Janeiro. Among the latter a great deal of re&s;erve and mode&s;ty is apparent between the &s;exes in public. Tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ay tender and civil things to a lady, mu&s;t do it by &s;tealth, or breathe their &s;oft &s;ighs through the lattice-work of a window, or the grates of a convent. But at the Cape, if you wi&s;h to be a favourite with the fair, as the cu&s;tom is, you mu&s;t in your own defence (if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion) <HI>grapple</HI> the lady, and paw her in a manner that does not partake in the lea&s;t of gentlene&s;s. Such a rough and uncouth
<PB N="96" REF="112">conduct, together with a ki&s;s ravi&s;hed now and then in the mo&s;t public manner and &s;ituations, is not only plea&s;ing to the fair one, but even to her parents, if pre&s;ent; and is con&s;idered by all parties as an act of the greate&s;t gal|lantry and gaiety. In fact, the Dutch ladies here, from a peculiar gay turn, admit of liberties that may be thought reprehen&s;ible in England; but perhaps as &s;eldom over&s;tep the bounds of virtue, as the women of other countries.</P>
<P>During my re&s;idence on &s;hore, whenever I heard of any Hottentots being in town, I made a point of endea|vouring to get a &s;ight of them, in order to &s;ee whether their manners and appearance corre&s;ponded with the de&s;cription given of them by travellers; &s;uch as being be&s;meared with grea&s;e, and decorated with the &s;tinking entrails of animals; on which they likewi&s;e, when pre&s;&s;ed by hunger, are &s;aid to feed.</P>
<P>I &s;aw many of the men, without being able to make any other remarks on them, than that they were thin, of rather a low &s;tature, but formed for activity: and further, that their hair, which was &s;hort and woolly, as well as their whole bodies, was bedaubed with &s;ome unctuous or grea&s;y &s;ub&s;tance, which was very offen&s;ive.
<PB N="97" REF="113">They were of a dark brown colour, had a flat no&s;e, thick lips, large full eyes, and were ornamented with ivory rings, and wore narrow &s;trips of the &s;kin of &s;ome animal, devoid of its hair, around their neck, legs, and arms. The only female of that nation I could get a &s;ight of, was during a little excur&s;ion in the environs of Cape Town: walking one evening with a Dutch getleman, to &s;ee a garden about a mile from the town, I accidentally met one of the&s;e ladies, who was equally as offen&s;ive as the male I had met.</P>
<P>The heavy draft work about the Cape is mo&s;tly performed by oxen; which are here brought to an uncommon degree of u&s;efulne&s;s and docility. It is not uncommon to &s;ee fourteen, &s;ixteen, and &s;ometimes eighteen, in one of their teams; when the roads are heavy, they &s;ometimes, though rarely, yoke twenty; all which the Hottentots, Malayes, and Cape &s;laves, have in the mo&s;t perfect &s;ubjection and obedience. One of the&s;e fellows places him&s;elf on the fore part of the waggon, or, when loaded, on the top of the load, and with a tremendous long whip, which, from its &s;ize, he is obliged to hold in both his hands, manages the&s;e creatures with inexpre&s;&s;ible addre&s;s. I have often
<PB N="98" REF="114">&s;een the driver, when he has found expedition needful, make them keep whatever pace he thought proper; either trot or gallop (a gait performed or kept up with diffi|culty by European oxen), and that with as much ea&s;e as if he was driving hor&s;es. This immen&s;e whip, the only thing with which they guide the team, the drivers u&s;e &s;o dexterou&s;ly, that they make them turn a corner with the utmo&s;t nicety; hitting even the leading pair, in whatever part they plea&s;e. The blows thus given mu&s;t inflict intolerable pain, or the&s;e &s;low animals could never be brought to go with the velocity they do at the Cape. The&s;e &s;ooty charioteers likewi&s;e manage hor&s;es with the &s;ame dexterity. To &s;ee one of them driving three, four, five, and &s;ometimes &s;ix pair, in hand, with one of the&s;e long whips, as I have often done with great &s;urpri&s;e, would make the mo&s;t complete ma&s;ter of the whip in England cut a de&s;picable figure. Carriages are not very numerous at the Cape, as the inhabitants in general travel in covered waggons, which better &s;uit the roughne&s;s of the country. The governor and &s;ome few of the principal people keep coaches, which are a good deal in the Engli&s;h &s;tile, and always drawn by &s;ix hor&s;es. The only chariot

<P>13th. About half pa&s;t one o'clock we &s;ailed from the Cape of Good Hope. A &s;mall American &s;hip had arrived during the forenoon, bound on a trading voyage to China, with &s;everal pa&s;&s;engers on board. We learnt from her, that the Hartwell Ea&s;t Indiaman had been lo&s;t, by bordering too clo&s;e on the i&s;land of Bonavi&s;ta, in order to land &s;ome recruits, who had mutinied, and occa&s;ioned great di&s;order and confu&s;ion in the &s;hip. It gave us plea&s;ure to hear from
<PB N="100" REF="116">the carpenter of the Hartwell, who was on board the American &s;hip, that no lives were lo&s;t by the accident. The principal part of the crew, we found, had got to Madeira, on their return to England. Abrea&s;t of Penguin I&s;land, about three o'clock, we pa&s;&s;ed a large Dutch &s;hip from Holland, bound to the Cape, with troops on board. A little before it was dark, we &s;poke the Kent whaler, from London, who had been four months out. She with our&s;elves was endeavouring to get to the ea&s;tward. On our fir&s;t di&s;covering her, as &s;he &s;eemed de&s;irous of joining or &s;peaking to the fleet, we were in hopes of her being from England, probably to us; or at lea&s;t that we might get letters by her; but our &s;u&s;pen&s;e on the&s;e points, a &s;u&s;pen&s;e only to be conceived by per&s;ons on long voyages, was &s;oon put an end to by hearing &s;he had been &s;o many months out. A few days before we left the Cape, &s;ome of the officers of the expe|dition received letters from England by the Ranger Ea&s;t India packet, Captain Buchanan, who had put in to water, and &s;top a leak; both of which being &s;oon accompli&s;hed, &s;he proceeded on her voyage.</P>

It gives me plea&s;ure to be able to add, that we only lo&s;t one per&s;on by this di&s;ea&s;e, violent and dangerous as it was; and that was Daniel Cre&s;&s;well, one of the troops intended for the garri&s;on; who was &s;eized on the 19th of November, and died the 30th of the &s;ame month, the eleventh day of his illne&s;s.

<PB N="107" REF="123">appearance and de&s;cription of Van Diernan's Land: indeed &s;uch as may prove extremely u&s;eful to &s;hips coming this way, and fully &s;ufficient to enable them to avoid all danger if the weather be clear. For my own part, I &s;ee no hazard that attends making this land by day (&s;uch an attempt by night would be very incautious and ab&s;urd), as nature has been very particular in pointing out where it lies, by rocks which jutt out of the &s;ea, like &s;o many beacons. I believe a convoy was never conducted with more care, or made the land with greater accuracy and certainty, than this. Indeed, ability and experienced nautical knowledge were never more fully evinced on all occa&s;ions than by Captain Hunter; who, I may venture to pronounce, without much ri&s;k of having my veracity called in que&s;tion, one of the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous and accurate ob&s;ervers, and able navigators, the pre&s;ent day furni&s;hes. His appointment to this expedition by Lord Howe is &s;trongly marked with that prudence and wi&s;dom which are known to govern his Lord|&s;hip's conduct. Captian Hunter has a pretty turn for draw|ing, which will enable him, no doubt, to give &s;uch a de&s;cription of this coa&s;t as will do credit to him&s;elf, and be of &s;ingular advantage, as well to tho&s;e who&s;e lot it may
<PB N="108" REF="124">to vi&s;it, hereafter, this exten&s;ive coa&s;t, as to navigation at large. The a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lieutenant Bradley, fir&s;t of the Sirius, (who likewi&s;e is an officer of more than common abilities), as a navigator in conducting a convoy in a track &s;o little known, mu&s;t have been plea&s;ing to Captain Hun|ter.</P>
<P>As we run in with the land, which is pretty high, we were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, &s;ome &s;mall patches of &s;now. The haze being di&s;per&s;ed, by a gentle breeze at N. N. W. we could ob&s;erve, and hear, as we were not more than &s;ix or &s;even miles from the &s;hore, the &s;urf beating high and loudly again&s;t &s;ome uneven rocks which jutted out, in &s;trange projections, into the &s;ea. This part of the coa&s;t, as far as we could &s;ee, is bold, irregular, and craggy; and very few trees, or appearance of verdure, to be &s;een. At four in the afternoon, being about &s;ix or eight miles to the ea&s;tward of the ea&s;tward-mo&s;t rock, called the Mew&s;tone (there being &s;everal others which we di&s;tinctly &s;aw), bearing N. N. W. we di&s;covered to the we&s;tward of them &s;ome eminences, which probably might be i&s;lands; or, if not, &s;ome land running a con&s;i|derable way into the &s;ea. For my own part I am inclined
<PB N="109" REF="125">to believe the latter to be the ca&s;e; though the di&s;tance was too great to hazard a conclu&s;ive opinion upon it, as a large &s;moke was &s;een clo&s;e to the innermo&s;t height.</P>
<P>About &s;even, &s;teering to the ea&s;tward, along &s;hore, nearly at the di&s;tance of four miles, being well in with the we&s;tward-mo&s;t point of a very large bay, called Storm Bay, laid down in lat. 44&deg; 3&prime; S. and long. 146&deg; E. we di&s;covered Swilly bearing S. E. &frac12; S. and a little to the ea&s;tward of it a &s;mall rock ri&s;ing out of the &s;ea, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the Eddy&s;tone, from its re&s;emblance to the Eddy|&s;tone light-hou&s;e off Plymouth, which was very per|ceptible at the di&s;tance we were then from it. Our being clo&s;e in with the land, prevented us from &s;eeing either of the&s;e before, as they lie at lea&s;t &s;ix or &s;even leagues out to &s;ea. From the S. W. cape, which lies in lat. 43&deg; 39&prime; S. and long. 145&deg; 50&prime; E. to the S. E. cape, which is admitted to be Ta&s;man's South Cape, is about the di&s;tance of fifteen or &s;ixteen leagues. As we got to the ea&s;tward, we &s;aw many trees, mo&s;tly of a dwarf or &s;tunted kind, with a whiti&s;h bark, and perfectly leafle&s;s. This part of the country &s;till continued to be a rough, rugged, uneven tract, with very little appearance of fertility.
<PB N="110" REF="126">Some &s;mall patches of verdure were di&s;covered about Storm Bay, and the trees &s;eemed to increa&s;e in number and &s;ize. Between eight and nine at night, we &s;aw a large fire on the ea&s;t point of land which forms this bay, made by the natives; none of whom could we &s;ee during the day, though clo&s;e in with the &s;hore: nor did we perceive any other indication of its being inhabited, but this fire, and the &s;moke mentioned to be &s;een on our fir&s;t falling in with the land. The di&s;tance between the &s;moke and the fire was eight leagues, a &s;pace that would &s;urely have exhibited &s;ome other proofs of populo&s;ity had it been thickly peopled.</P>
<P>About 10 o'clock, off Storm Bay, the weather moderately plea&s;ant, the &s;hip was taken aback. The Lady Penrhyn was then under our lee quarter, which obliged us to tack; after which we immediately wore, brought the &s;hip to the wind on the other tack, and &s;tood to &s;ea with the re&s;t of the &s;hips. The wind was then at N. E. which ju&s;t enabled us to weather Swilly and the Eddy&s;tone. As we got to &s;ea the wind increa&s;ed moderately.</P>

<P>8th. The wind and weather variable; could perceive no|thing of the land. I went on board the Fi&s;hburne, to &s;ee
<PB N="111" REF="127">the boat&s;wain, who, on the fir&s;t night of the new year, having probably drank more grog than he ought, and the &s;hip labouring much, had fallen from the top-&s;ail yard; by which he brui&s;ed him&s;elf in a dreadful manner. The man being highly &s;corbutic, the parts &s;oon mortified, and he died about half an hour after I got on board. The ma&s;ter of the &s;hip &s;howed evident marks of great concern for this <HI>invaluable</HI> man, as he termed him. He declared to me, that &s;ooner than venture again on &s;o long a voyage without a &s;urgeon, he would put to &s;ea with le&s;s than half his complement of men; for he was &s;trongly of opinion, that if the poor fellow had received immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance he would have recovered. I &s;hould have &s;een him &s;ooner, but was prevented by my own indifferent &s;tate of health. How owners of &s;hips can think of &s;ending them through &s;uch a variety of climates, and a voyage of &s;o great a length, without a &s;urgeon, is to me a matter of &s;urpri&s;e. The Lady Penrhyn, owned by Alderman Curtis, was the only mer|chant &s;hip in our fleet that had a &s;urgeon. What the others will do on their return, Heaven only knows; but this I well know, that they would never have reached

<P>10th. The wind variable, and weather dark and gloomy, with a very trouble&s;ome high &s;ea. About two o'clock P. M. we had one of the mo&s;t &s;udden gu&s;ts of wind I ever remember to have known. In an in&s;tant it &s;plit our main|&s;ail; and but for the activity &s;hewn by the &s;ailors, in let|ting fly the &s;heets, and lowering the top-&s;ails, the ma&s;ts mu&s;t have gone over the &s;ide. The Prince of Wales, who was clo&s;e to us, had her main yard carried away in the &s;lings. Fortunately for us the &s;quall was of &s;hort dura|tion, otherwi&s;e the &s;hips mu&s;t have &s;uffered con&s;iderably from the uncommon cro&s;s &s;ea that was running; which

We &s;aw a whale, &s;everal &s;eals, and many large oceanous birds, which we frequently fired at, without their betraying the &s;malle&s;t &s;ymptom of fear either at the report, or at the balls, which frequently dropped clo&s;e to them. A conclu&s;ion may be drawn from hence, that they had never been hara&s;&s;ed with fire arms before; if they had, they would undoubtedly have &s;hown &s;ome fear; a &s;en&s;ation they &s;eemed to be totally unacquainted with.

<P>19th. In the evening we &s;aw the land over Red Point, bearing W. by N. the extremes of the land from S. S. W. to N. We were then about three leagues from the &s;hore; and finding it unlikely to get in that night, Captain Hunter made the &s;ignal for the convoy to come within hail; when he acquainted them, that the entrance into Botany Bay bore N.

<P>20th. At four in the morning the Sirius and convoy made &s;ail, and at eight o'clock anchored in eight fathom water; Cape Banks E. S. E. Point Solander S. S. E. and the entrance of the bay, between the&s;e two lands, W. S. W. We found here the Supply tender, which had arrived the 18th, and the Alexander, Scarborough, and Friend&s;hip tran&s;ports, who had only arrived the day before. To fee all the &s;hips &s;afe in their de&s;tined port, without ever having, by any accident, been one hour &s;eparated; and all the people in as good health as could be expected or hoped for, after &s;o long a voyage, was a &s;ight truly plea&s;ing, and at which every heart mu&s;t rejoice. As we &s;ailed into the bay, &s;ome of the natives were on the &s;hore, looking with &s;eeming attention at &s;uch large moving bodies coming among&s;t them. In the evening the boats were permitted to land on the north &s;ide, in order to get water and gra&s;s for the little &s;tock we had remaining. An officer's guard was placed there to prevent the &s;eamen from &s;traggling, or having any improper inter|cour&s;e with the natives. Captain Hunter, after anchoring, waited on the governor, on board the Supply; who, with &s;everal other officers, landed. As they rowed along the &s;hore, &s;ome of the natives followed the boat; but on her
<PB N="115" REF="131">putting in for the &s;nore, they ran into the woods. Some of the gentlemen, however, before they returned on board, ob|tained an interview with them; during which they &s;howed &s;ome di&s;tru&s;t, but, upon the whole, were civilly inclined. The boats &s;ent to haul the &s;eine returned, having had tolerable &s;ucce&s;s. The fi&s;h they caught were bream, mullet, large rays, be&s;ides many other &s;maller &s;pecies.</P>

<P>21&s;t. The governor, Captain Hunter, and the two ma&s;ters of the men of war, with a party of marines, &s;et off this morning, in two rigged long boats, to examine Port Jack&s;on, a harbour lying a little to the northward, which was di&s;covered by Captain Cook.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>23d. The party returned this evening, full of prai&s;es on the extent and excellence of the harbour, as well as the &s;uperiority of the ground, water, and &s;ituation, to that of Botany Bay; which, I own, does not, in my opinion, by any means merit the commendations be&s;towed on it by the much-lamented Cook, and others, who&s;e names and judg|ments are no le&s;s admired and e&s;teemed. During his excel|lency's ab&s;ence the lieutenant governor had i&s;&s;ued his orders to land all the artificers that could be found among the con|victs, and a party of others, to clear the ground for the in|tended
<PB N="116" REF="132">town, to dig &s;awpits, and to perform every thing that was e&s;&s;ential towards the works purpo&s;ed to be carried on. Although the &s;pot fixed on for the town was the mo&s;t eligible that could be cho&s;en, yet I think it would never have an&s;wered; the ground around it being &s;andy, poor, and &s;wampy, and but very indifferently &s;upplied with water. The fine meadows talked of in Captain Cook's voyage, I could never &s;ee, though I took &s;ome pains to find them out; nor have I ever heard of a per&s;on that has &s;een any parts re&s;embling them. While the people were employed on &s;hore, the natives came &s;everal times among them, and behaved with a kind of cautious friend&s;hip. One evening, while the &s;eine was hauling, &s;ome of them were pre&s;ent, and expre&s;&s;ed great &s;urpri&s;e at what they &s;aw; giving a &s;hout expre&s;&s;ive of a&s;toni&s;hment and joy, when they per|ceived the quantity that was caught. No &s;ooner were the fi&s;h out of the water, than they began to lay hold of them, as if they had a right to them, or that they were their own; upon which the officer of the boat, I think very properly, re&s;trained them; giving, however, to each of them a part. They did not at fir&s;t &s;eem very well plea&s;ed with this mode of procedure, but on ob&s;erving
<PB N="117" REF="133">with what ju&s;tice the fi&s;h was di&s;tributed, they appeared content.</P>
<P>While we remained at Botany Bay, as I was one morning on board the Supply, we &s;aw twenty-nine of the natives on the beach, looking towards the &s;hipping; upon which Lieutenants Ball and King, Mr. Dawes, and my|&s;elf, went on &s;hore, landing at the place where they were. They were friendly and pacific, though each of them was arm|ed with a &s;pear or long dart, and had a &s;tick, with a &s;hell at the end, u&s;ed by them in throwing their weapons. Be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;ome few had &s;hields made of the bark of the cork tree, of a plain appearance, but &s;ufficient to ward off or turn their own weapons, &s;ome of which were pointed and barbed with the bones of fi&s;h, fa&s;tened on with &s;ome kind of adhe&s;ive gum. One of the mo&s;t friendly, and who appeared to be the mo&s;t confident, on &s;igns being made to him, &s;tuck the end of his &s;hield in the &s;and, but could not be prevailed upon to throw his &s;pear at it. Finding he declined it, I fired a pi&s;tol ball through it. The explo&s;ion frightened him, as well as his companions, a little; but they &s;oon got over it, and on my putting the pi&s;tol into my pocket, he took up the &s;hield, and appeared to be much
<PB N="118" REF="134">&s;urpri&s;ed at finding it perforated. He then, by &s;igns and ge&s;tures, &s;eemed to a&s;k if the pi&s;tol would make a hole through him; and on being made &s;en&s;ible that it would, he &s;howed not the &s;malle&s;t &s;igns of fear; on the contrary he endeavoured, as we con&s;trued his motions, to impre&s;s us with an idea of the &s;uperiority of his own arms, which he applied to his brea&s;t, and by &s;taggering, and a &s;how of falling, &s;eemed to wi&s;h us to under&s;tand that the force and effect of them was mortal, and not to be re&s;i&s;ted. How|ever, I am well convinced that they know and dread the &s;uperiority of our arms, notwith&s;tanding this &s;how of indif|ference; as they, on all occa&s;ions, have di&s;covered a di&s;like to a mu&s;quet: and &s;o very &s;oon did they make them&s;elves acquainted with the nature of our military dre&s;s, that, from the fir&s;t, they carefully avoided a &s;oldier, or any per&s;on wearing a red coat, which they &s;eem to have marked as a fighting ve&s;ture. Many of their warriors, or di&s;tingui&s;hed men, we ob&s;erved to be painted in &s;tripes, acro&s;s the brea&s;t and back, which at &s;ome little di&s;tance appears not unlike our &s;oldiers cro&s;s belts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>24th. The boats were employed in getting water and gra&s;s for the live &s;tock; as the governor, finding Port Jack|&s;on
<PB N="119" REF="135">more &s;uited to his wi&s;hes, had determined to remove to that place, and form the &s;ettlement there. While the&s;e preparations were making, every per&s;on in the fleet were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee, in this part of the world, two large &s;hips plying hard in the offing to get into the bay. It was &s;een, in the evening, that they had French colours flying; but the wind blowing pretty &s;trong out of the bay, they were unable to get in; and the weather becoming thick and hazy, we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>25th. Nothing of the &s;trange &s;hips to be &s;een. The governor, with a detachment of marines, &s;ailed in the Supply tender for Port Jack&s;on; leaving in&s;tructions with Captain Hunter to follow him with all the tran&s;ports and victuallers, as &s;oon as the wind and weather would permit.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>26th. We again de&s;cried the French &s;hips &s;tanding in for the bay, with a leading wind; upon which Captain Hunter &s;ent his fir&s;t lieutenant on board the commanding officer's &s;hip, which was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a broad pendant, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in coming in. 'Soon after the lieutenants were returned to the Sirius, Captain Clonnard, the French commodore's captain (who during the late war commanded
<PB N="120" REF="136">the Artois, taken by the Bienfai&s;ant, Captain Macbride), wait|ed on Captain Hunter, and informed him, that the &s;hips were the A&s;trolabe and the Bou&s;&s;ale, which &s;ailed from France in the year 1786, under the command of Me&s;&s;ieurs de la Perou&s;e, and De Langle. He further acquainted him, that having touched at Navigator's I&s;les, they had had the misfor|tune to lo&s;e Captain De Langle, the &s;econd in command, with ten other officers, and two boats crews, all of whom were cut off by the natives of tho&s;e i&s;lands, who appeared to be numerous and warlike. This accident induced them to put into this port, in order to build &s;ome boats, which they had in frames. It al&s;o had afforded room for the promotion of Mon&s;ieur Clonnard, who, on their leaving France, was only the commodore's fir&s;t lieutenant.</P>
<P>At ten o'clock the Sirius, with all the &s;hips, weighed, and in the evening anchored in Port Jack&s;on, with a few trifling damages done to &s;ome of them, who had run foul of each other in working out of Botany Bay. Port Jack&s;on I believe to be, without exception, the fine&s;t and mo&s;t exten|&s;ive harbour in the univer&s;e, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t &s;ecure; being &s;afe from all the winds that blow. It is divided into a great number of coves, to which his
<PB N="121" REF="137">excellency has given different names. That on which the town is to be built, is called Sydney Cove. It is one of the &s;malle&s;t in the harbour, but the mo&s;t convenient, as &s;hips of the greate&s;t burden can with ea&s;e go into it, and heave out clo&s;e to the &s;hore. Trincomal&eacute;, acknowledged to be one of the be&s;t harbours in the world, is by no means to be compared to it. In a word, Port Jack&s;on would afford &s;uffi|cient and &s;a&s;e anchorage for all the navies of Europe. The Supply had arrived the day before, and the governor, with every per&s;on that could be &s;pared from the &s;hip, were on &s;hore, clearning the ground for the encampment. In the evening, when all the &s;hips had anchored, the Engli&s;h colours were di&s;played; and at the foot of the flag-&s;taff his Maje&s;ty's health, and &s;ucce&s;s to the &s;ettlement, was drank by the governor, many of the principal officers, and private men, who were pre&s;ent upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>27th. A number of convicts from the different tran&s;|ports were landed to a&s;&s;i&s;t in clearing the ground for the encampment. His excellency marked the outlines, and as much as po&s;&s;ible to prevent irregularity, and to keep the convicts from &s;traggling, the provo&s;t mar&s;hal, aided by the patrole, had orders to take into cu&s;tody all convicts that
<PB N="122" REF="138">&s;hould be found without the lines, and to leave them in charge of the main or quarter guard. The boats &s;ent this day to fi&s;h were &s;ucce&s;sful. Some of the natives came into the little bay or cove where the &s;eine was hauled, and behaved very friendly. Indeed they carried their civility &s;o far, although a people that appeared to be aver&s;e to work, as to a&s;&s;i&s;t in dragging it a&s;hore. For this kind office they were liberally rewarded with fi&s;h, which &s;eemed to plea&s;e them, and give general &s;atisfaction.</P>

<P>29th. A convenient place for the cattle being found, the few that remained were landed. The frame and materials for the governor's hou&s;e, con&s;tructed by Smith in St. George's Fields, were likewi&s;e &s;ent on &s;hore, and &s;ome preparations made for erecting it. This day Captain Hunter and Lieutenant Bradley began to take a &s;urvey of the harbour. In the cour&s;e of the la&s;t week, all the marines, their wives and children, together with all the convicts, male and female, were landed. The laboratory and &s;ick tents were erected, and, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, were &s;oon filled with patients afflicted with the true camp dy&s;entery and the &s;curvy. More piti|able objects were perhaps never &s;een. Not a comfort or convenience could be got for them, be&s;ides the very few we
<PB N="123" REF="139"><MILESTONE N="February" UNIT="month"> had with us. His excellency &s;eeing the &s;tate the&s;e poor ob|jects were in, ordered a piece of ground to be inclo&s;ed, for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing vegetables for them. The &s;eeds that wee &s;own upon this occa&s;ion, on fir&s;t appearing above ground, looked promi&s;ing and well, but &s;oon after withered away; which was not indeed extraordinary, as they were not &s;own at a proper &s;ea&s;on of the year. The &s;ick have increa&s;ed &s;ince our landing to &s;uch a degree, that a &s;pot for a general ho&s;pital has been marked out, and arti|ficers already employed on it. A proper &s;pot, contiguous to the ho&s;pital, has been cho&s;en, to rai&s;e &s;uch vegetables as can be produced at this &s;ea&s;on of the year; and where a permanent garden for the u&s;e of the ho&s;pital is to be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

This refu&s;al obliged them to return; and when they came back they were real objects of pity. Con&s;cious of the puni&s;hment that awaited &s;o imprudent and improper an experiment, they had &s;tayed out as long as the cravings of nature would per|mit, and were nearly half &s;tarved. A woman named Ann Smith, and a man, have never &s;ince been heard of. They are &s;uppo&s;ed to have mi&s;&s;ed their way as they returned, and to have peri&s;hed for want. As the French commodore had given his honour that he would not admit any of them on
<PB N="126" REF="142">board, it cannot be thought he would take them. The convict, it is true, was a Frenchman, named Peter Paris, and it is po&s;&s;ible, on that account, he might have been con|cealed through pity, by his countrymen, and carried off without the knowledge of the commanding officer. At the very time the party from hence were gone by land to Botany Bay, Captain Clonnard came round in a boat, on a vi&s;it of ceremony from Mon&s;ieur de la Peyrou&s;e to the governor. He brought with him &s;ome di&s;patches, which he reque&s;ted might be forwarded to the French amba&s;&s;ador at the court of London, by the fir&s;t tran&s;ports that &s;ailed for England. The captain &s;tayed all night, and returned the next morn|ing. This day, for the fir&s;t time, a Kangaroo was &s;hot and brought into camp. Some of the natives pa&s;&s;ed pretty clo&s;e to the Sirius, without &s;eeming to expre&s;s, by their counte|nance or actions, either fear, curio&s;ity, or &s;urpri&s;e. During the cour&s;e of this week fourteen marriages were &s;olemnized. The criminal court, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix officers of his Maje&s;|ty's forces by land or &s;ea, with the judge advocate, &s;at for the fir&s;t time; before whom &s;everal convicts were tried for petty larceny. Some of them were acquitted, others &s;entenced to receive corporal puni&s;hment, and one or two were, by

<P>A <HI>New Holland Ca&s;&s;owary</HI> was brought into camp. This bird &s;tands &s;even feet high, mea&s;uring from the ground to the upper part of the head, and, in every re&s;pect, is much larger than the <HI>common Ca&s;&s;owary</HI> of all authors, and differs &s;o much therefrom, in its form, as to clearly prove it a new &s;pecies. The colour of the plumage is greatly &s;imilar, con&s;i&s;ting of a mixture of dirty brown and grey; on the belly it was &s;omewhat whiter; and the remarkable &s;tructure of the feathers, in having two quills with their webs ari&s;ing out of one &s;haft, is &s;een in this as well as the common &s;ort. It differs materially in wanting the horny appendage on the top of the head. The head and beak
<PB N="130" REF="147">are much more like tho&s;e of the o&s;trich than the common Ca&s;&s;owary, both in &s;hape and &s;ize. Upon the upper part of the head the feathers, with which it is but thinly covered, are very &s;mall, looking more like hair than fea|thers, and in having the neck pretty well clothed with them, except the chin and throat, which are &s;o thinly covered, that the &s;kin, which is there of a purpli&s;h colour, may be &s;een clearly. The &s;mall wings are exceedingly &s;hort, which form a ridiculous contra&s;t with the body, as they are even le&s;s than tho&s;e of the Ca&s;&s;owary: they have no large quills in them, being only covered with the &s;mall feathers that grow all over the body. Another &s;ingu|larity al&s;o pre&s;ents it&s;elf in this &s;pecies, which is in re&s;pect to the legs. As to the back part of them, the whole length is indented, or &s;awed, in a remarkable manner. The toes are three in number, the middle one long, the other two &s;hort, with &s;trong claws, not unlike the &s;ame part of the common &s;pecies. On examining the vi&s;cera, they differed from that of every other &s;pecies of the fea|thered kind which I had ever &s;een; particularly in having no gizzard, or &s;econd &s;tomach; and the liver was &s;o very &s;mall, that it did not exceed in &s;ize that of a black|bird.
<PB N="131" REF="148"><MILESTONE N="March" UNIT="month"> To this liver was joined a large gall-bladder, well di&s;tended with bile. The crop, or &s;tomach, was filled with at lea&s;t &s;ix or &s;even pounds of gra&s;s, flowers, and a few berries and &s;eeds. The inte&s;tinal canal was at lea&s;t &s;ix yards long, very wide, and of a regular cylindrical &s;hape from the opening of the &s;tomach to the vent. The heart and lungs were &s;eparated by a diaphragm or midriff, and bore a tolerable proportion to the &s;ize of the bird. The fle&s;h of this bird was very good, and ta&s;ted not unlike young tender beef.</P>
<P>This bird is &s;uppo&s;ed to be not uncommon in <HI>New Holland,</HI> as it has been frequently &s;een by our Settlers both at <HI>Botany Bay</HI> and <HI>Port Jack&s;on,</HI> but is exceedingly &s;hy, and runs fa&s;ter than a greyhound.

<P>March 9th. The governor, with two long boats manned and armed, returned from Broken Bay, &s;ituated a little to the northward, which he had been exploring for &s;everal days. It affords good &s;helter for &s;hipping, and the entrance is bold;
<PB N="132" REF="149">it cannot, however, be compared to Port Jack&s;on. While he was there, he &s;aw a great many of the natives, &s;ome of whom he thinks he had ob&s;erved before, either at Botany Bay or in the neighbourhood of Port Jack&s;on. One of the females happened to fall in love with his great coat; and to obtain it, &s;he u&s;ed a variety of means. Fir&s;t, &s;he danced, and played a number of antic tricks; but finding this mode ineffectual, &s;he had recour&s;e to tears, which &s;he &s;hed plenti|fully. This expedient not an&s;wering, &s;he cea&s;ed from weeping, and appeared as cheerful as any of the party around her. From this little incident it may be &s;een that they are not a people devoid of art. At Broken Bay many of the females, young and old, had the fir&s;t joint of the little finger, on their left hand, cut off. As this was the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who were married, or appeared to be &s;o from their having young children, as well as with tho&s;e who were too young for a connection of that nature, it was not po&s;&s;ible to ac|count for the cau&s;e of &s;uch an amputation. Thefts and depre|dations on one another have become &s;o very frequent and glaring among the convicts, that &s;carcely a day pa&s;&s;es without &s;ome of the&s;e mi&s;erable delinquents being puni&s;hed. So hardened in wickedne&s;s and depravity are many of them, that they &s;eem
<PB N="133" REF="150">in&s;en&s;ible to the fear of corporal puni&s;hment, or even death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The principal bu&s;ine&s;s going forward at pre&s;ent is erecting cabbage-tree huts for the officers, &s;oldiers, and convicts; &s;ome &s;tore-hou&s;es, &amp;c.; and a very good ho&s;pital; all which in the completion will co&s;t a great deal of time and trouble, as the timber of this country is very unfit for the purpo&s;e of building. Nor do I know any one purpo&s;e for which it will an&s;wer, except for fire-wood; and for that it is excellent: but, in other re&s;pects, it is the wor&s;t wood that any country or climate ever produced; although &s;ome of the trees, when &s;tanding, appear fit for any u&s;e whatever, ma&s;ts for &s;hipping not excepted. Strange as it may be ima|gined, no wood in this country, though &s;awed ever &s;o thin, and dried ever &s;o well, will float. Repeated trials have only &s;erved to convince me that, immediately on immer&s;ion, it &s;inks to the bottom like a &s;tone.</P>
<P>The &s;tone of this country is excellent for building, could any kind of cement be found to keep it together. There is not any lime-&s;tone (I believe) in New South Wales. The governor, notwith&s;tanding that he had collected together all the &s;hells which could be found, for the purpo&s;e of
<PB N="134" REF="151">obtaining from them the lime nece&s;&s;ary to the con&s;truction of a hou&s;e for his own re&s;idence, did not procure even a fourth part of the quantity which was wanted. The foun|dation &s;tone of a private hou&s;e for him has been laid; and a plate of copper, with the following in&s;cription engraved on it, is to be placed in the wall:
<Q>ARTHUR PHILLIP, ESQ. Captain General in and over his Maje&s;ty's Territory of New South Wales, and its Dependencies; Arrived in this Country on the 18th Day of January, 1788, with the fir&s;t Settlers; And on the 15th Day of May, in the &s;ame Year, the fir&s;t of the&s;e Stones was laid.</Q></P>
<P>The Supply tender returned from Norfolk I&s;land; where, with great difficulty and danger, the &s;tores &s;ent with Lieu|tenant King were landed, on account of the rockyne&s;s of its &s;hore, and the violence of the &s;urf that almo&s;t continually beats upon it. In her pa&s;&s;age there &s;he fell in with an
<PB N="135" REF="152">i&s;land, in lat. 31&deg; 36&prime; S. long. 159&deg; 4&prime; E. never before di&s;|covered, to which Lieutenant Ball, who commanded the Supply on this occa&s;ion, gave the name of Lord Howe's I&s;land. On her return to this port &s;he &s;topped at it, and found the landing nearly, if not quite, as difficult as at Norfolk I&s;land. The &s;hore in many places was covered with excellent turtle, eighteen of which were brought here, and proved a &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply to the convicts afflicted with the &s;curvy, many of whom were in a deplorable &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The &s;malle&s;t turtle brought from Lord Howe's I&s;land did not weigh le&s;s than 150lb. They al&s;o found on it, in great plenty, a kind of fowl, re&s;embling much the Guinea fowl in &s;hape and &s;ize, but widely different in colour; they being in general all white, with a red fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance ri&s;ing, like a cock's comb, from the head, and not unlike a piece of &s;ealing-wax. The&s;e not being birds of flight, nor in the lea&s;t wild, the &s;ailors availing them&s;elves of their gentlene&s;s and inability to take wing from their pur&s;uits, ea&s;ily &s;truck them down with &s;ticks. There were al&s;o many birds of the dove kind, as tame as the former, and caught with equal facility. Some of them were brought alive to this place. Be&s;ides the&s;e, the &s;hore abounded with &s;ea

His excellency, attended by Lieutenant Ball of the navy, Lieutenant George John&s;ton of the marines, the judge advocate, my&s;elf, three &s;oldiers, and two &s;eamen, landed in Manly Cove (&s;o called from the manly conduct of the natives when the governor fir&s;t vi&s;ited it), on the north &s;ide of the entrance into Port Jack&s;on harbour, in order to trace to its &s;ource a river, which had been di&s;covered a few days before. We, however, found this impracticable, owing to a thicket and &s;wamp which ran along the &s;ide of it. The governor, anxious to acquire all the knowledge of the coun|try in his power, forded the river in two places, and more than up to our wai&s;ts in water, in hopes of being able to avoid the thicket and &s;wamp; but, notwith&s;tanding all his per&s;everance, we were at length obliged to return, and to proceed along the &s;ea &s;hore, a mile or two to the northward.

<PB N="137" REF="155">At the end of this we fell in with a &s;mall &s;alt-water lagoon, on which we found nine birds, that, whil&s;t &s;wimming, mo&s;t perfectly re&s;embled the <HI>rara avis</HI> of the ancients&mdash;a <HI>black</HI> &s;wan. We di&s;charged &s;everal &s;hot at them, but the di&s;tance was too great for execution. Our frequent firing, however, cau&s;ed them to take wing, and they flew towards the &s;ea, which was very near, in the order that wild gee&s;e generally pre&s;erve; the one before the other. Had we not rai&s;ed them, we &s;hould certainly have concluded that they were black &s;wans; but their flight gave us an opportunity of &s;eeing &s;ome white feathers, which terminated the tip of each wing; in every other part they were perfectly black. Their &s;ize appeared not equal to that of an European &s;wan, but the &s;hape exactly corre&s;ponded, except about the wings, which &s;eemed rather &s;mall for the body. We not long after di&s;covered the great brown King's Fi&s;her, of which a plate is annexed. This bird has been di&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>Latham</HI> in his <HI>General Synop&s;is of Birds,</HI> vol. ii. p. 603, nearly to the following purport:&mdash;The length eighteen inches; the bill black above, and white beneath; the feathers of the head narrow, and pretty long, &s;o as to form a kind of cre&s;t. They are of a brown colour, &s;treaked with paler brown; the
<PB N="138" REF="156">back and wings in general brown; the lower part of the back and rump pale blue-green; the outer edges of the quills blue; within and the tips black. On the wing covert is a patel of glo&s;&s;y blue-green: the tail is barred with ferru|ginous, and &s;teel-black, glo&s;&s;ed with purple; the end, for one inch, white; the under part of the body is white, tran&s;|ver&s;ely &s;treaked with du&s;ky lines; legs yellow, claws black.</P>
<P>This bird is not uncommon in many i&s;lands of the <HI>South Seas,</HI> being pretty frequent at <HI>New Guinea,</HI> from whence the &s;pecimen came from which Mr. <HI>Latham</HI> took his de|&s;cription: it is al&s;o an inhabitant of <HI>New Holland,</HI> from whence &s;everal have been &s;ent over to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>We rounded this lagoon, and proceeded four or five miles we&s;tward, along the banks of a &s;mall fre&s;h-water river, which emptied it&s;elf into it, and had for its &s;ource only a &s;wamp, or boggy ground. After we had pa&s;&s;ed this &s;wamp, we got into an immen&s;e wood, the trees of which were very high and large, and a con&s;iderable di&s;tance apart, with little under or bru&s;h wood. The ground was not very good, although it produced a luxuriant coat of a kind of &s;our gra&s;s growing in tufts or bu&s;hes, which, at &s;ome di&s;|tance, had the appearance of meadow land, and might be

Here we pitched our tents (without which the governor never travelled) for the night, near a &s;wamp, out of which we were &s;upplied with water, not, indeed, either of the be&s;t or cleare&s;t kind. The night being cold, and a heavy dew falling, we kept up a large fire before the tents, which, though in one re&s;pect an excellent precaution, far from cha&s;ing away, &s;eemed to allure the mu&s;quitos, which tormented us inexpre&s;&s;ibly during the whole night. We this day di&s;covered the Bank&s;ian Cockatoo. This &s;pecies was fir&s;t de&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>Latham,</HI> in his &s;eventh volume or &s;upplement to the <HI>Ge|neral Synop&s;is of Birds,</HI> and the one in the plate annexed differs from that in &s;ome few particulars.&mdash;In Mr. <HI>Latham</HI>'s figure the general colour is du&s;ky black, the fea|thers of the head longer than the re&s;t, forming a cre&s;t; and each of tho&s;e on the head, back of the neck, and major part of the wings, have a &s;pot of buff-colour at the tips; the under parts of the body barred with narrow bars of buff-colour; the tail is black at the bottom and ends of the feathers, but the middle of a fine red, barred irregu|larly with black.&mdash;In our &s;pecimen, the general colour of the bird is olive, or ru&s;ty black; the head feathers pretty
<PB N="140" REF="159">long, and about the &s;ides of the head and top of it is a mixture of fine yellow; but none of the feathers are marked with buff at the tips, nor is the under part of the body cro&s;&s;ed with buff-colour. In the tail it differs &s;carcely at all from Mr. <HI>Latham</HI>'s figure.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds have been met with in &s;everal parts of <HI>New Holland.</HI></P>
<P>We likewi&s;e &s;aw &s;everal Blue-bellied Parrots. This is a very beautiful bird; and Mr. <HI>Latham,</HI> who&s;e leave we have to copy the account of it, from his <HI>Syn.</HI> vol. i. p. 213, N^o 14. B. de&s;cribes it thus: <Q>The length is fifteen inches; the bill is reddi&s;h; orbits black; head and throat dark blue, with a mixture of lighter blue feathers; back part of the head green; towards the throat yellow green; back and wings green; prime quills du&s;ky, barred with yellow; brea&s;t red, mixed with yellow; belly of a fine blue; thighs green and yellow; tail cuneiform; the two middle feathers green; the others the &s;ame, but bright yellow on the outer edges; legs du&s;ky.</Q></P>
<P>This bird is a very common &s;pecies in various parts of <HI>New Holland,</HI> and in great plenty both at <HI>Botany Bay</HI> and <HI>Port Jack&s;on.</HI> It is found to differ much in plumage,

<P>16th. We pur&s;ued our route we&s;tward, proceeding many miles inland, without being able to trace, by a &s;ingle ve&s;tige, that the natives had been recently in tho&s;e parts. We &s;aw, however, &s;ome proofs of their ingenuity, in various figures cut on the &s;mooth &s;urface of &s;ome large &s;tones. They con|&s;i&s;ted chiefly of repre&s;entations of them&s;elves in different attitudes, of their canoes, of &s;everal &s;orts of fi&s;h and animals; and, con&s;idering the rudene&s;s of the in&s;truments with which the figures mu&s;t have been executed, they &s;eemed to ex|hibit tolerably &s;trong likene&s;&s;es. On the &s;tones, where the natives had been thus exerci&s;ing their abilities in &s;culpture, were &s;everal weather-beaten &s;hells. The country all around this place was rather high and rocky; and the &s;oil arid, parched, and inho&s;pitable.</P>
<P>In the evening, after a long and fatiguing march, we fell in with the north-we&s;t branch of Port Jack&s;on harbour. Here the two &s;eamen, overcome with fatigue, and having their &s;hoes torn from their feet through the ruggedne&s;s of the road along which we had travelled, could proceed no further. This circum&s;tance induced the governor to con&s;ign them to
<PB N="142" REF="161">the care of Lieutenant Ball, and a marine, &s;upplying them with provi&s;ions &s;ufficient to la&s;t them till they reached the &s;hips.

About four o'clock in the afternoon we came to a &s;teep valley, where the flow|ing of the tide cea&s;ed, and a fre&s;h-water &s;tream commenced. Here, in the mo&s;t de&s;ert, wild, and &s;olitary &s;eclu&s;ion that the imagination can form any idea of, we took up our abode for the night; dre&s;&s;ed our provi&s;ions, wa&s;hed our &s;hirts and &s;tockings, and turned our inconvenient &s;ituation to the be&s;t advantage in our power. Saw this day the Anomalous Hornbill, of which a plate is annexed. This bird is &s;o very &s;ingular in its &s;everal characteri&s;tics, that it can &s;carcely be &s;aid to which of the pre&s;ent known genera to refer it. In the <HI>bill</HI> it &s;eems mo&s;t allied to the <HI>hornbill,</HI> but the <HI>legs</HI> are tho&s;e of a <HI>toucan,</HI> and the <HI>tongue</HI> is more like that of a <HI>crow</HI> than any other: it mu&s;t therefore be left to future ornitho|logi&s;ts to determine the point, re&s;ting here &s;atisfied with de&s;cribing its external appearance.</P>

<P>This &s;ingular bird was met with at <HI>New Holland,</HI> from whence three or four &s;pecimens have found their way to England, but whether it is a numerous &s;pecies has not been mentioned.</P>
<P>The next morning we hid our tents and the remains of our provi&s;ions, and with only a little rum, and a &s;mall quantity of bread, made a forced march into the country, to the we&s;tward, of about fourteen miles, without being able to &s;ucceed in the object of our &s;earch, which was for good land well watered. Indeed, the land here, although covered with an endle&s;s wood, was better than the parts which we had already explored. Finding it, however, very unlikely that we &s;hould be able to penetrate through this immen&s;e fore&s;t, and circum&s;tanced as we were, it was
<PB N="144" REF="164">thought more prudent to return. We, accordingly, after an expeditious walk, reached the &s;tream from whence we had &s;et out in the morning, and taking up the tents and provi&s;ions which we had left, proceeded a little farther down, to the flowing of the tide, and there pitched our tents for the night; during which it rained very heavily, with thunder and lightning. The Wattled Bee-eater, of which a plate is annexed, fell in our way during the cour&s;e of the day. This bird is the &s;ize of a <HI>mi&s;&s;el thru&s;h,</HI> but much larger in proportion; its total length being about fourteen inches. The feathers on the upper part of the head, longer than the re&s;t, give the appearance of a cre&s;t; tho&s;e of the un|der part are &s;mooth; the plumage for the mo&s;t part is brown, the feathers long and pointed, and each feather has a &s;treak of white down the middle; under the eye, on each &s;ide, is a kind of <HI>wattle,</HI> of an orange colour; the middle of the belly is yellow; the tail is wedge-&s;haped, &s;imilar to that of the <HI>magpie,</HI> and the feathers tipped with white; the bill and legs are brown.</P>
<P>This bird &s;eems to be peculiar to <HI>New Holland,</HI> and is un|doubtedly a &s;pecies which has not hitherto been de&s;cribed.</P>

Some places along the &s;hore, where the tide had flowed &s;o as to ob&s;truct our pa&s;&s;age, we were obliged to ford; and, at times, we were under the nece&s;&s;ity of climbing heights nearly inacce&s;&s;ible. At length, after undergoing much fatigue, we were agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed, and cheered, with the &s;ight of two boats, &s;ent by Captain Hunter to meet us, and ju&s;t then coming up with the tide. By them we learnt, that Lieutenant Ball, with his enfeebled party, had arrived &s;afe at the &s;hip the day after they had quitted us. We all went on board the boats, and fell down the river till we got to a plea&s;ant little cove, where we dined, with great &s;atisfaction and comfort, upon the welcome provi&s;ions which were &s;ent in the boats by the governor's &s;teward. After having refre&s;hed our&s;elves, we again embarked, and about &s;ix o'clock in the evening arrived in Sydney Cove.</P>
<P>We were likewi&s;e able, during this excur&s;ion, to take one of the Gold-winged Pigeons, of which a plate is annexed. This bird is a curious and &s;ingular &s;pecies, remarkable for having mo&s;t of the feathers of the wing marked with a brilliant &s;pot of golden yellow, changing, in various reflections of light, to green and copper-bronze; and, when the wing is clo&s;ed,
<PB N="146" REF="168">forming two bars of the &s;ame acro&s;s it. The general colour of the bird otherwi&s;e is brown, changing to vinaceous red on the brea&s;t, in the manner of our dome&s;tic &s;pecies. The fore part of the head and chin are buff colour, with a &s;treak of browni&s;h red pa&s;&s;ing on each &s;ide through the eye. The quills and tail are darker than the re&s;t of the plumage, but all the feathers of the la&s;t, except the two middle ones, incline to lead colour, with a bar of black near the tip. The bill and legs are of a dull red.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies is a native of <HI>New South Wales,</HI> &s;everal of them having been &s;ent from <HI>Port Jack&s;on.</HI></P>

<P>22d. On the morning of this day the governor, accom|panied by the &s;ame party, with the addition of Lieutenant Cre&s;&s;well of the marines and &s;ix privates, landed at the head of the harbour, with an intention of penetrating into the country we&s;tward, as far as &s;even days provi&s;ions would admit of; every individual carrying his own allowance of bread, beef, rum, and water. The &s;oldiers, be&s;ide their own provi&s;ions, carried a camp kettle, and two tents, with their poles, &amp;c. Thus equipped, with the additional weight of &s;pare &s;hoes, &s;hirts, trow&s;ers, together with a great coat, or Scotch plaid, for the purpo&s;e of &s;leeping in, as

<PB N="147" REF="170">the nights were cold we proceeded on our de&s;tination. We likewi&s;e took with us a &s;mall hand hatchet, in order to mark the trees as we went on; tho&s;e marks (called in America <HI>blazing</HI>) being the only guide to direct us in our return. The country was &s;o rugged as to render it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to explore our way by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the compa&s;s.</P>
<P>In this manner we proceeded for a mile or two, through a part well covered with enormous trees, free from under|wood. We then reached a thicket of bru&s;h-wood, which we found &s;o impervious, as to oblige us to return nearly to the place from whence we had &s;et out in the morning. Here we encamped, near &s;ome &s;tagnant water, for the night, during which it thundered, lightened, and rained. About eleven o'clock the governor was &s;uddenly attacked with a mo&s;t violent complaint in his &s;ide and loins, brought on by cold and fatigue, not having perfectly gotten the better of the la&s;t expedition. The next morning being fine, his excellency, who was rather better, though &s;till in pain, would not relinqui&s;h the object of his pur&s;uit; and therefore we proceeded, and &s;oon got round the wood or thicket which had hara&s;&s;ed us &s;o much the day before.
<PB N="148" REF="171">After we had pa&s;&s;ed it, we fell in with an hitherto unper|ceived branch of Port Jack&s;on harbour, along the bank of which the gra&s;s was tolerably rich and &s;ucculent, and in height nearly up to the middle, inter&s;per&s;ed with a plant much re&s;embling the indigo. We followed this branch we&s;tward for a few miles, until we came to a &s;mall fre&s;h water &s;tream that emptied it&s;elf into it. Here we took up, our quarters for the night, as our halts were always regulated by fre&s;h water, an e&s;&s;ential point by no means to be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and not very abundant, or frequently to be met with, in this country. We made a kettle of excellent &s;oup out of a white cockatoo and two crows which I had &s;hot, as we came along. The land all around us was &s;imilar to that which we had pa&s;&s;ed. At night we had thunder, lightning, and rain. The governor, though not free from pain, was rather recovering.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>24th. As &s;oon as the dew, which is remarkably heavy in this country, was off the ground, we proceeded to trace the river, or &s;mall arm of the &s;ea. The banks of it were now plea&s;ant, the trees immen&s;ely large, and at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other; and the land around us flat, and rather low, but well covered with the kind of gra&s;s ju&s;t
<PB N="149" REF="172">mentioned. Here the tide cea&s;ed to flow; and all further progre&s;s for boats was &s;topped by a flat &s;pace of large broad &s;tones, over which a fre&s;h water &s;tream ran. Ju&s;t above this flat, clo&s;e to the water-&s;ide, we di&s;covered a quarry of &s;lates; from which we expected to derive great advantage in re&s;pect to covering our hou&s;es, &s;tores, &amp;c. it being a material beyond conception difficult to be procured in this country; but on trial it was found of no u&s;e, as it proved to be of a crumbling and rotten nature. On this fre&s;h water &s;tream, as well as on the &s;alt, we &s;aw a great many ducks and teal; three of which we &s;hot in the cour&s;e of the day, be&s;ides two crows, and &s;ome loraquets. About four in the after|noon, being near the head of the &s;tream, and &s;omewhat apprehen&s;ive of rain, we pitched our tents, before the gra&s;s became wet; a circum&s;tance which would have proved very uncomfortable during the night. Here we had our ducks picked, &s;tuffed with &s;ome &s;lices of &s;alt beef, and roa&s;ted; and never did a repa&s;t &s;eem more delicious; the &s;alt beef, &s;erving as a palatable &s;ub&s;titute for the want of &s;alt, gave it an agreeable reli&s;h. The evening cleared up, and the night proved dry. During the latter, we heard a noi&s;e which not a little &s;urpri&s;ed us, on acoount of its re&s;emblance
<PB N="150" REF="173">to the human voice. What it proceeded from we could not di&s;cover; but I am of opinion that it was made by a bird, or &s;ome animal. The country round us was by no means &s;o good, or the gra&s;s &s;o abundant, as that which we had pa&s;&s;ed. The water, though neither clear, nor in any great quantity, was neither of a bad quality nor ill-ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>The next day, after having &s;owed &s;ome &s;eeds, we pur&s;ued our route for three or four miles we&s;t, where we met with a mean hut, belonging to &s;ome of the natives, but could not perceive the &s;malle&s;t trace of their having been there lately. Clo&s;e to this hut we &s;aw a Kangaroo, which had come to drink at an adjacent pool of &s;tagnated water, but we could not get within &s;hot of it. A little farther on, we fell in with three huts, as de&s;erted as the former, and a &s;wamp, not unlike the American rice grounds. Near this we &s;aw a tree in flames, without the lea&s;t appearance of any natives; from which we &s;u&s;pected that it had been &s;et on fire by lightning. This circum&s;tance was fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted by Lieutenant Ball; who had remarked, as well as my&s;elf, that every part of the country, though the mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible and rocky, appeared as if, at certain times of the year, it had been all on fire. Indeed in
<PB N="151" REF="174">many parts we met with very large trees, the trunks of which and branches were evidently rent, and demoli&s;hed by lightning. Clo&s;e by the burning tree we &s;aw three kangaroos. Though by this time very much fatigued, we proceeded about two miles farther on, in hopes of finding &s;ome good water, but without effect; and about half pa&s;t four o'clock we took up our quarters near a &s;tagnant pool. The ground was &s;o very dry and parched, that it was with &s;ome difficulty we could drive either our tent pegs or poles into it. The country about this &s;pot was much clearer of underwood than that which we had pa&s;&s;ed during the day. The trees around us were immen&s;ely large, and the tops of them filled with loraquets and paroquets of exqui&s;ite beauty, which chattered to &s;uch a degree, that we could &s;carcely hear each other &s;peak. We fired &s;everal times at them, but the trees were &s;o very high that we killed but few.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>26th. We &s;till directed our cour&s;e we&s;tward, and pa&s;&s;ed another tree on fire; and others which were hollow, and perforated by a &s;mall hole at the bottom, in which the natives &s;eemed to have &s;nared &s;ome animal. It was certainly done by the natives, as the trees where the&s;e
<PB N="152" REF="175">holes or perforations were, had in general many knotches cut, for the purpo&s;e of getting to the top of them. After this we cro&s;&s;ed a water-cour&s;e; which &s;hews, that at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons the rain is very heavy here, notwith&s;tanding that there was, at pre&s;ent, but little water in it. Beyond the cha&s;m, we came to a plea&s;ant hill, the top of which was tolerably clear of trees, and perfectly free from underwood. His excellency gave it the name of <HI>Belle Ve&uuml;e.</HI> From the top of this hill we &s;aw a chain of hills or mountains, which appeared to be thirty or forty miles di&s;tant, running in a north and &s;outh direction. The northernmo&s;t being con&s;picuou&s;ly higher than any of the re&s;t, the governor called it <HI>Richmond Hill;</HI> the next, or tho&s;e in the centre, <HI>Lan&s;down Hills;</HI> and tho&s;e to the &s;outhward, which are by much the lowe&s;t, <HI>Carmarthen Hills.</HI></P>
<P>In a valley below <HI>Belle Ve&uuml;e,</HI> we &s;aw a fire, and by it found &s;ome chewed root of a &s;aline ta&s;te, which &s;hewed that the natives had recently been there. The country hereabout was plea&s;ant to the eye, well wooded, and covered with long &s;our gra&s;s, growing in tufts. At the bottom of this valley or flat, we cro&s;&s;ed another water-cour&s;e, and
<PB N="153" REF="176">a&s;cended a hill, where the wood was &s;o very thick as to ob&s;truct our view. Here, finding our provi&s;ions to run &s;hort, our return was concluded on, though with great reluctance; as it was our wi&s;h, and had been our deter|mination, to reach the hills before us if it had been po&s;&s;ible. In our way back, which we ea&s;ily di&s;covered by the marks made in the trees, we &s;aw a hollow tree on fire, the &s;moke i&s;&s;uing out of the top part as through a chimney. On coming near, and minutely examining it, we found that it had been &s;et on fire by the natives; for there was &s;ome dry gra&s;s lighted and put into the hole wherein we had &s;uppo&s;ed they u&s;ed to &s;nare or take the animal before alluded to. In the evening, where we pitched our tents, we &s;hot two crows and &s;ome loraquets, for &s;upper. The night was fine and clear; during which we often heard, as before, a &s;ound like the human voice, and, from its continuance on one &s;pot, we concluded it to proceed from a bird perched on &s;ome of the trees near us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>27th. We now found our&s;elves obliged to make a forced march back, as our provi&s;ions were quite exhau&s;ted; a circum&s;tance rather alarming, in ca&s;e of lo&s;ing our way; which, however, we met with no difficulty in di&s;covering,
<PB N="154" REF="177">by the marked trees. By our calculation we had penetrated into the country, to the we&s;tward, not le&s;s than thirty-two, or thirty-three miles. This day we &s;aw the dung of an animal as large as that of a hor&s;e, but it was more like the excrement of a hog, intermixed with gra&s;s. When we got as far back as the arm or branch of the &s;ea which forms the upper part of Port Jack&s;on harbour, we &s;aw many ducks, but could not get within &s;hot of any of them. It was now growing late; and the governor being appre|hen&s;ive that the boats which he had ordered to attend daily, might be, for that day, returning before we could reach them, he &s;ent Lieutenants John&s;ton and Cre&s;&s;well, with a marine, a-head, in order to &s;ecure &s;uch provi&s;ions as might have been &s;ent up; and to give directions for the boats to come for us the next morning, as it then appeared very unlikely that all the party, who were, without excep|tion, much fatigued, could be there &s;oon enough to &s;ave the tide down. Tho&s;e gentlemen accordingly went forward, and were &s;o fortunate as to be ju&s;t in time; and they returned to us with a &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply of bread, beef, rum, and wine. As &s;oon as they had joined us, we encamped for the night, on a &s;pot about the di&s;tance of a
<PB N="155" REF="178">mile from the place where the boats were to take us up in the morning. His excellency was again indi&s;po&s;ed, occa|&s;ioned by a return of his complaint, which had been brought on by a fall into a hollow place in the ground, that being concealed by the long gra&s;s, he was unable to di&s;cern. We pa&s;&s;ed the next day in examining different inlets in the upper part of the harbour. We &s;aw there &s;ome of the natives, who, in their canoes, came along-&s;ide of the boat, to receive &s;ome trifles which the governor held out to them. In the evening we returned to Sydney Cove.</P>

William Ayres, a convict, who was in a &s;tate of convale&s;cence, and to whom I had given permi&s;&s;ion to go a little way into the country, for the purpo&s;e of gathering a few herbs wherewith to make tea, was, after night, brought to the ho&s;pital, with one of the &s;pears u&s;ed by the natives &s;ticking in his loins.

<P>25th. The Supply arrived from Lord Howe's I&s;land without a &s;ingle turtle, the object for which &s;he was &s;ent: a dreadful di&s;appointment to tho&s;e who were langui&s;hing under the &s;curvy; many of whom are &s;ince dead, and there
<PB N="158" REF="182">is great rea&s;on to fear that &s;everal others will &s;oon &s;hare the &s;ame fate.

And even then I am apprehen&s;ive that there will not be a &s;ufficiency pro|duced, &s;uch are the labour and difficulty which attend the clearing of the ground. It will &s;carcely be credited, when I declare that I have known twelve men employed for five days, in grubbing up one tree; and when this has been effected, the timber (as already ob&s;erved) has been only fit for fire|wood; &s;o that in con&s;equence of the great labour in clearing of the ground, and the weak &s;tate of the people; to which may be added the &s;carcity of tools, mo&s;t of tho&s;e we had being either worn out by the hardne&s;s of the timber, or lo&s;t in the woods among the gra&s;s, through the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the convicts; the pro&s;pect before us is not of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing kind.

The &s;urgeon had his gun with him, the effects of which he let the old man &s;ee, by &s;hooting a bird, which fell at his feet.

<P>30th. Captain Campbell of the marines, who had been up the harbour to procure &s;ome ru&s;hes for thatch, brought to the ho&s;pital the bodies of William Okey and Samuel Davis, two ru&s;h-cutters, whom he had found murdered by the natives in a &s;hocking manner. Okey was transfixed through the brea&s;t with one of their &s;pears which with great difficulty and force was pulled out. He had two other &s;pears &s;ticking in him to a depth which mu&s;t have proved mortal. His &s;kull was divided and comminuted &s;o much that his brains ea&s;ily found a pa&s;&s;age through. His eyes were out, but the&s;e might have been picked away by birds. Davis was a youth, and had only &s;ome trifling marks of violence about him. This lad could not have been many hours dead; for when Captain Campbell found him, which was among &s;ome mangrove-trees, and at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the place where the other man lay, he was not &s;tiff, nor very cold; nor was he perfectly &s;o when brought to the ho&s;pital. From the&s;e circum&s;tances we have been led to think that while they were di&s;patching Okey, he had crept to the

What was the motive or cau&s;e of this me|lancholy cata&s;trophe we have not been able to di&s;cover; but from the civility &s;hewn, on all occa&s;ions, to the officers, by the natives, whenever any of them were met, I am &s;trongly inclined to think that they mu&s;t have been provoked and injured by the convicts. We this day caught a Yellow-eared Flycatcher (&s;ee annexed plate). This bird is a native of <HI>New Holland,</HI> the &s;ize of a martin, and nearly &s;even inches in length; the bill is broad at the bottom, and of a pale colour; the legs du&s;ky; the plumage is mo&s;tly brown, mottled with paler brown; the edges of the wing feathers yellowi&s;h; the under part of the body white, inclining to du&s;ky about the chin and throat; the tail is pretty long, and, when &s;pread, &s;eems hollowed out at the tip; beneath the eye, on each &s;ide, is an irre|gular &s;treak, growing wider, and fini&s;hing on the ears, of a yellow or gold colour.</P>
<P>Early the next morning the governor, lieutenants G. John&s;ton and Kellow, my&s;elf, &s;ix &s;oldiers, and two armed convicts, whom we took as guides, went to the place where
<PB N="162" REF="187">the murder had been committed, in hopes, by &s;ome means or other, to be able to find out, either the actual perpe|trators, or tho&s;e concerned. As mo&s;t of their clothes, and all their working tools were carried off, we expected that the&s;e might furni&s;h us with &s;ome clue; but in this we were di&s;appointed. We could not ob&s;erve a &s;ingle trace of the natives ever having been there. We then cro&s;&s;ed the country to Botany Bay, &s;till flattering our&s;elves that we might be able to di&s;cover, among a tribe at that place, &s;ome proof that they had been concerned; as the governor was re&s;olved, on whom&s;oever he found any of the tools or clothing, to &s;hew them his di&s;plea&s;ure, and, by every means in his power, endeavour to convince them of his motives for &s;uch a procedure. In our route we &s;aw &s;everal kangaroos, and &s;hot a very fine teal. A little before &s;un-&s;et, after a long and fatiguing march, we arrived at Botany Bay. When we approached the bay, we &s;aw eleven canoes, with two per&s;ons in each, fi&s;hing; mo&s;t of them had a fire in their canoe, a convenience which they &s;eldom go without at any time or &s;ea&s;on, but particularly at this, as the weather was very cold. Here we pitched our tents, for (as I have before ob&s;erved) we
<PB N="163" REF="188">never travel without them, and kindled large fires both in front and rear; &s;till, however, the cold was &s;o very inten&s;e that we could &s;carcely clo&s;e our eyes during the night. In the morning the gra&s;s was quite white with a hoar fro&s;t, &s;o as to crackle under our feet. After breakfa&s;t we vi&s;ited the grave of the French abb&eacute;, who died whil&s;t the Count de Peyrou&s;e was here. It was truly humble indeed, being di&s;tingui&s;hed only by a common head-&s;tone, &s;tuck &s;lightly into the loo&s;e earth which covered it. Again&s;t a tree, ju&s;t above it, was nailed a board, with the following in&s;cription on it:
<Q>HIC JACET LE RECEVEUR EX F. F. MINORIBUS GALLIA SACERDOS PHYSICUS IN CIRCUMNAVIGATIONE MUNDI DUCE D. DE LA PEYROUSE. OBIIT DIE 17th FEBR. ANNO 1788.</Q>
As the painting on the board could not be permanent, Go|vernor Phillip had the in&s;cription engraved on a plate of copper, and nailed to the &s;ame tree; and at &s;ome future day he intends to have a hand&s;ome head-&s;tone placed at
<PB N="164" REF="189">the grave. We cut down &s;ome trees which &s;tood be|tween that on which the in&s;cription is fixed and the &s;hore, as they prevented per&s;ons pa&s;&s;ing in boats from &s;eeing it.</P>
<P>Between this and the harbour's mouth, we found forty-nine canoes hauled upon the beach, but not a native to be &s;een. After we had pa&s;&s;ed them, we fell in with an Indian path; and, as it took a turn towards the camp, we followed it about two miles; when on a &s;udden, in a valley or little bay, to the northward of Botany Bay, we were &s;urpri&s;ed at hearing the &s;ound of voices, which we in&s;tantly found to proceed from a great number of the natives, &s;itting behind a rock, who appeared to be equally a&s;toni&s;hed with our&s;elves; as, from the &s;ilence we ob&s;erved, they had not perceived us till we were within twenty yards of them. Every one of them, as they got up, armed him&s;elf with a long &s;pear, the &s;hort &s;tick before de&s;cribed, u&s;ed in throwing it, a &s;hield made of bark, and either a large club, pointed at one end, or a &s;tone hatchet. At fir&s;t they &s;eemed rather ho&s;tilely inclined, and made &s;igns, with apparent tokens of anger, for us to return; but when they &s;aw the governor ad|vance
<PB N="165" REF="190">towards them, unarmed, and with his hands opened wide (a &s;ignal we had ob&s;erved among them of amity and peace), they, with great confidence, came up to him, and received from him &s;ome trifles which he had in his pocket, &s;uch as fi&s;h-hooks, beads, and a looking-gla&s;s. As there appeared not to be le&s;s than three hundred of them in this bay, all armed, the &s;oldiers were ordered to fix their bayonets, and to ob&s;erve a clo&s;e, well connected, order of march, as they de&s;cended the hill. The&s;e people (as already mentioned) &s;eem to di&s;like red coats, and tho&s;e who carry arms; but, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, they &s;hewed very little fear or di&s;tru&s;t; on the contrary they, in a few minutes, mixed with us, and conducted us to a very fine &s;tream of water, out of which &s;ome of them drank, to &s;hew that it was good. The women and children kept at &s;ome di&s;tance, one or two more forward than the re&s;t excepted, who came to the governor for &s;ome pre&s;ents. While he was di&s;tributing his gifts, the women danced (an exerci&s;e every de&s;cription of people in this country &s;eem fond of), and threw them&s;elves into &s;ome not very decent attitudes.</P>
<P>The men in general had their &s;kins &s;meared all over
<PB N="166" REF="191">with grea&s;e, or &s;ome &s;tinking, oily &s;ub&s;tance; &s;ome wore a &s;mall &s;tick, or fi&s;h-bone, fixed cro&s;s-ways, in the di|vi&s;ion of the no&s;e, which had a very &s;trange appearance; others were painted in a variety of ways, and had their hair ornamented with the teeth of fi&s;h, fa&s;tened on by gum, and the &s;kin of the kangaroo. As they conducted us to the water, a toad&s;tool was picked up by one of our company, which &s;ome of the natives perceiving, they made &s;igns for us to throw it away, as not being good to eat. Soon after I gathered &s;ome wood-&s;orrel, which grew in our way, but none of them endeavoured to prevent me from eating it; on the contrary, if a conclu&s;ion may be drawn from the &s;igns which they made relative to the toad&s;tool, they &s;hewed, by their looks, that there was nothing hurtful in it.</P>
<P>We halted but a &s;hort time with them, as it was growing late, and we had a long way to walk. Before we parted from them, the governor gave them two &s;mall hand-axes, in exchange for &s;ome of their &s;tone axes and two of their &s;pears. As we a&s;cended a hill, after our de|parture from them, eight of them followed us until we had nearly reached the top, where one of tho&s;e who had
<PB N="167" REF="192">been mo&s;t familiar with us made &s;igns for us to &s;top; which we readily complying with, he ran to the &s;um|mit, and made a &s;trange kind of hallooing, holding at the &s;ame time his hands open above his head. As &s;oon as we came up to him, we di&s;covered another large body of them in a bay, about half a mile below us. Our new friend &s;eemed anxious to carry us down to them; but it not being in our way, we declined his offer. Seeing us take another direction, he halted, and opened his hands, in order, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, to put us in mind that he had received no|thing from us; upon which we pre&s;ented him with a bird, the only thing we had, with which he returned, to appear|ance, fully content and &s;atisfied. We now proceeded to|wards the camp, where we arrived about &s;un-&s;et.</P>
<P>This was the greate&s;t number of the natives we had ever &s;een together &s;ince our coming among them. What could be the cau&s;e of their a&s;&s;embling in &s;uch numbers gave ri&s;e to a variety of conjectures. Some thought they were going to war among them&s;elves, as they had with them a tempo|rary &s;tore of half-&s;tinking fi&s;h and fern-root, the latter of which they u&s;e for bread. This we remarked, as &s;everal of them were eating it at the time we were among them.
<PB N="168" REF="193">Others conjectured that &s;ome of them had been concerned in the murder of our men, notwith&s;tanding we did not meet with the &s;malle&s;t trace to countenance &s;uch an opi|nion, and that fearing we &s;hould revenge it, they had formed this convention, in order to defend them&s;elves again&s;t us. Others imagined that the a&s;&s;emblage might be occa&s;ioned by a burial, a marriage, or &s;ome religious meeting.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tabuan Parrot,</HI> one of which was ob&s;erved here, and of which a plate is annexed, is a bird about eighteen inches in length, and bigger than the Scarlet Lory. The head, neck, and under parts, are of a fine &s;carlet; the upper parts of the body and wings are of a beautiful green; acro&s;s the upper part of the wing coverts is an oblique bar of yellowi&s;h green, more glo&s;&s;y than the re&s;t; the lower part of the back and rump is blue; there is al&s;o a &s;mall patch of blue at the lower part of the neck be|hind, between a &s;carlet and green, dividing tho&s;e colours; the tail is pretty long, and of an olive brown colour; the bill is reddi&s;h; the legs deep brown, nearly black.</P>
<P>The <HI>Female</HI> is mo&s;tly green; the head, neck, and under parts olive brown; belly red; rump blue; tail, on the upper &s;urface, green; beneath, du&s;ky.</P>

<P>June 4th. This being the anniver&s;ary of his Maje&s;ty's birth-day, and the fir&s;t celebration of it in New South Wales, his excellency ordered the Sirius and Supply to fire twenty-one guns at &s;un-ri&s;e, at one o'clock, and at &s;un-&s;et. Im|mediately after the King's &s;hips had cea&s;ed firing, at one o'clock, the Borrowdale, Friend&s;hip, Fi&s;hburne, Golden Grove, and Prince of Wales, fired five guns each. The battalion was under arms at twelve, and fired three vollies, &s;ucceeded by three cheers. After this ceremony had taken place, the lieutenant-governor, with all the officers of the &s;ettlement, civil and military, paid their re&s;pects to his excellency, at his hou&s;e. At two o'clock they all met there again to dinner, during which the band of mu&s;ick
<PB N="170" REF="197"><MILESTONE N="June" UNIT="month"> played "God &s;ave the King," and &s;everal excellent marches. After the cloth was removed, his Maje&s;ty's health was drank with three cheers. The Prince of Wales, the Queen and royal family, the Cumberland family, and his Royal Highne&s;s Prince William Henry, &s;ucceeded. His Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters were next given; who, it was ob&s;erved, may be <HI>Pitted</HI> again&s;t any that ever conducted the affairs of Great Britain.</P>
<P>When all the public toa&s;ts had gone round, the governor nominated the di&s;trict which he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, <HI>Cumberland County;</HI> and gave it &s;uch an extent of boundary as to make it the large&s;t county in the whole world. His excellency &s;aid, that he had intended to have named the town, and laid the fir&s;t &s;tone, on this au&s;picious day; but the unexpected difficulties which he had met with, in clearing the ground, and from a want of artificers, had rendered it impo&s;&s;ible; he therefore put it off till a future day. Its name, however, we under&s;tand, is to be ALBION. The day was pa&s;&s;ed in cheerfulne&s;s and good-humour; but it was a little damped by our perceiving that the governor was in great pain, from a return of his complaint. Though his countenance too plainly indicated
<PB N="171" REF="198">the torture which he &s;uffered, he took every method in his power to conceal it, le&s;t it &s;hould break in upon the fe&s;tivity and harmony of the day. His excellency or|dered every &s;oldier a pint of porter, be&s;ides his allow|ance of grog; and every convict half a pint of &s;pirits, made into grog, that they all may drink his Maje&s;ty's health; and, as it was a day of general rejoicing and fe&s;tivity, he likewi&s;e made it a day of forgivene&s;s; remitting the remainder of the puni&s;hment to which the &s;ailors of the Sirius were &s;ubject, and pardoning Lovel, Sideway, Hall, and Gordon, who had been confined on a little &s;terile i&s;land, or rather rock, &s;ituated in the harbour, until a place of bani&s;hment could be found. This act of lenity and mercy, added to many others which the governor had &s;hewn, it is to be hoped will work &s;ome change on the minds of the&s;e men. Indeed &s;ome good may be expected from Hall and Gordon, who, &s;ince their &s;entence, have appeared penitent; but from Lovel and Sideway very little change for the better can be expected, becau&s;e they &s;eem &s;o truly abandoned and incorrigible. At night every per&s;on attended an immen&s;e bonfire that was lighted for the occa&s;ion; after which the principal officers of the &s;ettlement, and of
<PB N="172" REF="199">the men of war, &s;upped at the governor's, where they termi|nated the day in plea&s;antry, good humour and cheerfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>The next morning we were a&s;toni&s;hed at the number of thefts which had been committed, during the general fe&s;ti|vity, by the villanous part of the convicts, on one another, and on &s;ome of the officers, who&s;e &s;ervants did not keep a &s;trict look-out after their marqu&eacute;es. Availing them&s;elves thus of the particular circum&s;tances of the day, is a &s;trong in&s;tance of their unabated depravity and want of principle. Scarcely a day pa&s;&s;es without an example being made of &s;ome one or other of the&s;e wretches; but it &s;eems to have no manner of effect upon them.</P>

<P>10th. John A&s;cott and Patrick Burn, two convicts, were brought before the criminal court, and pro&s;ecuted by Lieutenant G. William Maxwell of the Sirius, and Mr. Kelter the Ma&s;ter of the &s;ame &s;hip, for having, a few nights before, in a riotous manner, with many more of the con|victs, attacked &s;ome &s;eamen belonging to the men of war, and behaving in an in&s;olent and contemptuous manner to them. After a long and judicious hearing, the pri&s;oners were acquitted, as the charge brought again&s;t them was by no means &s;ub&s;tantiated.</P>

<P>26th. About four in the afternoon a &s;light &s;hock of an earthquake was felt at Sidney Cove, and its environs. This incident had &s;o wonderful an effect on Edward Corbett, a convict, who had eloped about three weeks before, on a di&s;covery being made of his having &s;tolen a frock, that he returned and gave him&s;elf up to ju&s;tice. A few days ante|cedent to his return, he had been outlawed; and was &s;up|po&s;ed to have driven off with him four cows, the only animals of this kind in the colony. This, however, he declared him&s;elf innocent of; but confe&s;&s;ed his having com|mitted the theft laid to his charge. The &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch was made, but in vain, after the cows. It is probable that they have &s;trayed &s;o far off in this endle&s;s wild, as to be irrecoverably lo&s;t. Previou&s;ly to the return of Corbett he mu&s;t have &s;uffered very &s;everely from hunger; his eyes were &s;unk into his head, and his whole appearance &s;hewed that he had been half &s;tarved. While he was ab&s;ent, he &s;ays, he frequently fell in with the natives, who, though they never treated him ill, did not &s;eem to like his com|pany. He informed us, that in a bay adjacent to that where the governor and his party had met with &s;o many of the natives, he &s;aw the head of one of the convicts lying near
<PB N="174" REF="201">the place where the body had been burnt in a large fire. This, in all likelihood, was Burn, who was carried off at the time Ayres was wounded, as he has not been heard of &s;ince.</P>
<P>The natives of this country, though their mode of &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting &s;eems to be &s;o very &s;canty and precarious, are, I am convinced, not cannibals. One of their graves, which I &s;aw opened, the only one I have met with, contained a body which had evidently been burned, as &s;mall pieces of the bones lay in the bottom of it. The grave was neatly made, and well covered with earth and boughs of trees.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pennantian Parrot</HI> (of which &s;ee plate annexed) was about this time fir&s;t noticed. The general colour of the body, in the <HI>male,</HI> is crim&s;on; the feathers of the back black in their middle; the chin and throat blue; the wings blue, with a bar of a paler colour down the middle of them; the tail is long, and blue al&s;o, and all but the two middle feathers have the ends very pale.</P>
<P>The <HI>female</HI> differs, in having the upper parts of the neck and body of a greeni&s;h colour; the top of the head red, and a patch of the &s;ame under each eye; the chin and

<P>24th. The governor revoked the decree by which Corbett was outlawed, and he was tried by the criminal court, &s;imply for the theft he had committed, and &s;entenced to be hanged. Samuel Payton, a convict, likewi&s;e received the &s;ame &s;entence, for feloniou&s;ly entering the marqu&eacute;e of Lieu|tenant Fuzer, on the night of the fourth of June, and &s;teal|ing from thence &s;ome &s;hirts, &s;tockings, and combs. His trial had been put off to the pre&s;ent time, on account of a wound in his head, which he had received from Captain Lieu|tenant Meredith, who, on his return from the bonfire, found Payton in his marqu&eacute;e. When brought to the ho&s;pital, in con&s;equence of the wound which he had received, he was perfectly &s;en&s;ele&s;s. During the time he remained under my care, I frequently admoni&s;hed him to think of the perilous &s;ituation he then &s;tood in, and to make known the accom|plices whom he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have; but he firmly and uniformly denied his guilt; and di&s;claimed his having any
<PB N="176" REF="205">knowledge of, or concern in, robbing Lieutenant Fuzer. He further &s;aid, that he did not recollect how he came to Captain Lieutenant Meredith's tent, or any circum&s;tance relative to it. However, &s;ince he received his &s;entence, he has confe&s;&s;ed that he robbed Lieutenant Fuzer; and gave him information where to find the articles he had been robbed of: he at the &s;ame time acknowledged that he entered Mr. Meredith's marqu&eacute;e with an intention to rob him, doubting not but he &s;hould be able to make his e&s;cape undi&s;covered, as every one &s;eemed &s;o fully engaged on the plea&s;ures of the day.</P>
<P>When he and Corbett were brought to the fatal tree, they (particularly Payton) addre&s;&s;ed the convicts in a pathetic, eloquent, and well-directed &s;peech. He acknowledged the ju&s;tice of his &s;entence; a &s;entence, which (he &s;aid) he had long de&s;erved. He added, that he hoped and tru&s;ted that the ignominious death he was about to &s;uffer, would &s;erve as a caution and warning to tho&s;e who &s;aw and heard him. They both prayed mo&s;t fervently, begging forgivene&s;s of an offended GOD. They likewi&s;e hoped, that tho&s;e whom they had injured, would not only forgive them, as they them&s;elves did all mankind, but offer up their prayers to
<PB N="177" REF="206">a merciful REDEEMER that, though &s;o great &s;inners, they might be received into that bli&s;s, which the good and vir|tuous only can either de&s;erve or expect. They were now turned off; and in the agonizing moments of the &s;eparation of the &s;oul from the body &s;eemed to embrace each other. The execution of the&s;e unhappy youths, the elde&s;t of whom was not twenty-four years of age, which &s;eemed to make a greater impre&s;&s;ion on the convicts than any circum&s;tance had done &s;ince their landing, will induce them, it is to be hoped, to change their conduct, and to adopt a better mode of life than, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, they have hitherto pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>The principal bu&s;ine&s;s now going forward, is the erecting huts for the marines and convicts, with the cabbage-tree. We have been here nearly &s;ix months, and four officers only as yet got huts: when the re&s;t will be provided with them &s;eems uncertain; but this I well know, that living in tents, as the rainy &s;ea&s;on has commenced, is truly uncomfortable, and likely to give a &s;evere trial to the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t robu&s;t con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The trees of this country are immen&s;ely large, and clear of branches to an amazing height. While &s;tanding, many
<PB N="178" REF="207">of them look fair and good to the eye, and appear &s;ufficient to make a ma&s;t for the large&s;t &s;hip; but, when cut down, they are &s;carcely convertible to any u&s;e whatever. At the heart they are full of veins, through which an amazing quantity of an a&s;tringent red gum i&s;&s;ues. This gum I have found very &s;erviceable in an ob&s;tinate dy&s;entery that raged at our fir&s;t landing, and &s;till continues to do &s;o, though with le&s;s ob&s;tinacy and violence. When the&s;e trees are &s;awed, and any way expo&s;ed to the &s;un, the gum melts, or gets &s;o very brittle, that the wood falls to pieces, and appears as if the pieces had been joined together with this &s;ub&s;tance. How any kind of hou&s;es, except tho&s;e built of the cabbage tree, can be rai&s;ed up, the timber being &s;o exceedingly bad, it is impo&s;&s;ible to determine.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid that the &s;tone of this country is well calculated for building, could any kind of cement be found to keep them together. As for lime-&s;tone, we have not yet di&s;covered any in the country; and the &s;hells collected for that purpo&s;e have been but incon&s;iderable. From Captain Cook's account, one would be led to &s;uppo&s;e that oy&s;ter and cockle &s;hells might be procured in &s;uch quantities, as to make a &s;ufficiency of lime, for the
<PB N="179" REF="208">purpo&s;e of con&s;tructing at lea&s;t a few public buildings; but this is by no means the ca&s;e. That great navigator, notwith&s;tanding his u&s;ual accuracy and candour, was certainly too lavi&s;h of his prai&s;es on Botany Bay.</P>
<P>The peculiarity I have mentioned relative to the wood of this place is &s;trange. There are only three kinds of it, and neither of them will float on the water. We have found another re&s;in here, not unlike the bal&s;am Tolu in &s;mell and effect, but differing widely in colour, being of a clear yellow, which exudes from the tree. This, however, is not to be met with in &s;uch quantities as the red gum before mentioned, nor do I think that its medicinal virtues are by any means &s;o powerful. A kind of earth has been di&s;covered which makes good bricks, but we &s;till are in want of a cement for them as well as for the &s;tone.</P>
<P>What animals we have yet met with have been mo&s;tly of the Opo&s;&s;um kind. The Kangaroo, &s;o very accurately delineated by Captain Cook, is certainly of that cla&s;s, and the large&s;t animal &s;een in the country. One has been brought into camp which weighed a hundred and forty-nine pounds. See plate annexed. The conformation of this animal is peculiarly &s;ingular. Its hinder parts have great mu&s;cular
<PB N="180" REF="209">power, and are, perhaps, beyond all parallel, out of proportion, when compared with the fore parts. As it goes, it jumps on its two hind legs, from twenty to twenty-eight feet, and keeps the two fore ones clo&s;e to the brea&s;t; the&s;e are &s;mall and &s;hort, and it &s;eems to u&s;e them much like a &s;quirrel. The tail of the&s;e animals is thick and long; they keep it extended, and it &s;erves as a kind of counterpoi&s;e to the head, which they carry erect, when bounding at full &s;peed. The velocity of a Kangaroo as far out&s;trips that of a greyhound, as that animal exceeds in &s;wiftne&s;s a common dog. It is a very timid, &s;hy, and inoffen&s;ive creature, evidently of the granivorous kind. Upon our fir&s;t di&s;covering one of them, as it does not u&s;e its fore feet to a&s;&s;i&s;t it in running, or rather jumping, many were of opinion that the tail, which is immen&s;ely large and long, was made u&s;e of by them in the act of progre&s;&s;ion; but this is by no means the ca&s;e. Had it been u&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, the hair would probably have been worn away from the part which, of cour&s;e, mu&s;t be applied to the ground. The tail, from its &s;ize and weight, &s;eems to &s;erve it for a weapon both of defence and offence; for it does not appear that nature has provided it with any other. Its mouth and head,
<PB N="181" REF="210">even when full grown, are too &s;mall for it to do much execution with the teeth; nor is the conformation of either at all calculated for the purpo&s;e. Indeed, its fore feet, which it u&s;es, as a &s;quirrel or monkey, to handle any thing with, and which a&s;&s;i&s;t it in lying down, are too &s;mall, and out of proportion, as are all the &s;uperior parts, to admit of its either po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing or exerting much &s;trength. It has been reported by &s;ome convicts who were out one day, accompanied by a large Newfoundland dog, that the latter &s;eized a very large Kangaroo, but could not pre&s;erve its hold. They ob&s;erved that the animal effected its e&s;cape by the defen&s;ive u&s;e it made of its tail, with which it &s;truck its a&s;&s;ailant in a mo&s;t tremendous manner. The blows were applied with &s;uch force and efficacy, that the dog was brui&s;ed, in many places, till the blood flowed. They ob&s;erved that the Kangaroo did not &s;eem to make any u&s;e of either its teeth or fore feet, but fairly beat off the dog with its tail, and e&s;caped before the convicts, though at no great di&s;tance, could get up to &s;ecure it.</P>
<P>The female has a pouch or pocket, like the Opo&s;&s;um, in which &s;he carries her young. Some have been &s;hot with a young one, not larger than a walnut, &s;ticking to a teat
<PB N="182" REF="211">in this pocket. Others, with young ones not bigger than a rat: one of which, mo&s;t perfectly formed, with every mark and di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of the Kangaroo, I have &s;ent to Mr. Wil&s;on, of Gower Street, Bedford Square.</P>
<P>There is a peculiar formation in the generative parts of this animal. Of its natural hi&s;tory we at pre&s;ent know little; and therefore as we are &s;o unacquainted with its habits, haunts, and cu&s;toms, to attempt particular and accurate de&s;criptions of it might beget error, which time, or a fuller knowledge of its properties, would directly contradict. As to mere conjectures (and &s;uch too often are impo&s;ed upon the public for inconte&s;tible facts), it cannot be improper to &s;uppre&s;s them.</P>
<P>Every animal in this country partakes, in a great mea&s;ure, of the nature of the Kangaroo. We have the Kangaroo Opo&s;&s;um, the Kangaroo Rat, &amp;c. In fact every quadruped that we have &s;een, except the flying &s;quirrel, and a &s;potted creature, nearly the &s;ize of a Martin, re&s;embles the Kangaroo in the formation of the fore legs and feet, which bear no proportion to the length of the hind legs.</P>
<P>The &s;carcity of boats will prevent our being &s;o well &s;upplied with fi&s;h, as otherwi&s;e might be expected. Fi&s;h
<PB N="183" REF="212">is far from abounding at the cold &s;ea&s;on of the year; but, in the &s;ummer, judging from the latter end of the la&s;t, we have every rea&s;on to conclude that the little bays and coves in the harbour are well &s;tored with them. The fi&s;h caught here are, in general, excellent; but &s;everal of them, like the animals in &s;ome degree re&s;embling the Kangaroo, partake of the properties of the &s;hark. The land, the gra&s;s, the trees, the animals, the birds, and the fi&s;h, in their different &s;pecies, approach by &s;trong &s;hades of &s;imilitude to each other. A certain likene&s;s runs through the whole.</P>

<P>July 8th. A party of the natives came to the place where the Sirius's boat had been to haul the &s;eine, and having beaten the crew, took from them by force a part of the fi&s;h which they had caught. It is a great misfortune to us that we cannot find proper wood in this place wherewith to build a boat; particularly as fi&s;h is not only &s;o very plentiful in the &s;ummer, but the only change from &s;alt provi&s;ions which we can procure, there being neither wild nor dome&s;tic animals fit for food. Here, where no other animal nouri&s;hment is to be procured, the Kangaroo is con&s;idered as a dainty; but in any other country I am &s;ure that &s;uch food would be thrown to
<PB N="184" REF="213"><MILESTONE N="July" UNIT="month"> the dogs; for it has very little or no fat about it, and, when &s;kinned, the fle&s;h bears &s;ome likene&s;s to that of a fox or lean dog.</P>
<P>A few days &s;ince a civil court of juri&s;diction (which con&s;i&s;ted of the judge advocate, the Reverend Mr. John&s;on, and my&s;elf), was convened, by his excellency, to hear a complaint made again&s;t Duncan Sinclair, ma&s;ter of the Alexander tran&s;port, by Henry Coble and Su&s;annah his wife (the Norwich convicts who &s;o much excited the public attention), for the non-delivery of a parcel &s;ent on board the Alexander, by Mrs. Jack&s;on of Somer&s;et Street, containing wearing apparel, books, and other things, for the u&s;e of the &s;aid Henry Coble, his wife, and child, value twenty pounds. The parcel was proved (and this even by the acknowledgment of the ma&s;ter) to have been received on board; and it likewi&s;e appeared in evidence that, on moving it from one part of the &s;hip to another, the package had broken, and the books had fallen out, which books the convict &s;aid had been delivered to him. The court, after deducting five pounds (the value of the books received), gave a verdict in favour of the couple, in who&s;e cau&s;e the world had &s;eemed &s;o much to intere&s;t
<PB N="185" REF="214">and in con&s;equence of the authority unto them granted by Act of Parliament, in &s;uch ca&s;es made and provided, they adjudged the ma&s;ter of the tran&s;port fully to com|pen&s;ate the lo&s;s of the convicts, amounting to fifteen pounds. Sinclair con&s;idered it as oppre&s;&s;ive to be obliged to pay for that on account of which he had not received any freightage; but this objection had no weight with the court, as the &s;hip was in the &s;ervice of government, and paid for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of conveying the&s;e people, and the little property which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to this country.</P>

<P>July 13th. The Alexander, Friend&s;hip, and Prince of Wales tran&s;ports, with the Borrowdale victualler, &s;ailed for England. His Maje&s;ty's brig the Supply &s;ailed at the &s;ame time for Norfolk I&s;land, with provi&s;ions, &amp;c. for the people there.</P>

<P>21&s;t. I went down the harbour, with the ma&s;ter of the Golden Grove victualler, to look for a cabbage tree, as a covering for my hut. On our return, we fell in with three canoes that had been out fi&s;hing. We rowed towards them, when the natives in them &s;uddenly appeared intimidated, and paddled away with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. Willing to
<PB N="186" REF="215">convince them that they had nothing to dread from us, we rowed after them, in order to pre&s;ent them with &s;ome trifles which we had about us. When we approached the canoes, an old woman in one of them began to ca&s;t her fi&s;h overboard, in great ha&s;te; whether it was for fear that we &s;hould take them from her, or whether &s;he threw them to us, we could not a&s;certain. However, when we came along-&s;ide, our conduct &s;oon convinced her that her alarms, with re&s;pect to us, were groundle&s;s. She had in the canoe with her a young girl, whom, as &s;he wore a complete apron, we could not help con&s;idering as &s;uch an in&s;tance of female decency, as we had not at any other time ob&s;erved among the natives. The girl did not betray the lea&s;t &s;ign of apprehen&s;ion, but rather &s;eemed plea&s;ed at the interview. She laughed immoderately, either at us, or at the petulance &s;hown by the old woman, who, I believe, was more terrified on the girl's account than on her own. After this we left them fully &s;atisfied that we did non mean to offer them any injury.</P>
<P>We di&s;covered the <HI>New Halland Creeper;</HI> (See plate annexed). The general colour of the bird is black, &s;potted in various parts with white: the bill is du&s;ky, growing paler

The neck, brea&s;t, belly, and &s;ides are more or le&s;s &s;treaked with white; over the eye is al&s;o a white &s;treak, and the &s;ides of the neck and beginning of the back have likewi&s;e &s;ome &s;treaks of the &s;ame. The quills and tail feathers are marked with yellow on the outer margins; the la&s;t are rounded in &s;hape, and two or three of the outer feathers &s;potted within, at the tip, with white; legs du&s;ky; is about the &s;ize of a <HI>nightingale,</HI> and mea&s;ures &s;even inches in length. It is probably a non|de&s;cript &s;pecies.</P>
<P>A party of convicts, who had cro&s;&s;ed the country to Botany Bay to gather a kind of plant re&s;embling balm, which we found to be a good and plea&s;ant vegetable, were met by a &s;uperior number of the natives, armed with &s;pears and clubs, who cha&s;ed them for two miles without being able to overtake them; but if they had &s;ucceeded in the pur&s;uit, it is probable that they would have put them to death; for wherever per&s;ons unarmed, or inferior in num|bers, have fallen in with them, they have never failed to maltreat them. The natives had with them &s;ome middling &s;ized dogs, &s;omewhat re&s;embling the &s;pecies called, in England, fox-dogs. A &s;ervant of Captain Shea being
<PB N="188" REF="218">one day out &s;hooting, he found a very young puppy, belonging to the natives, eating part of a dead Kangaroo. He brought it to the camp, and it thrives much. The dog, in &s;hape, is rather &s;hort and well made; has very fine hair of the nature of fur, and a &s;agacious look. When found, though not more than a month old, he &s;howed &s;ome &s;ymp|toms of ferocity. It was a con&s;iderable time before he could be induced to eat any fle&s;h that was boiled, but he would gorge it raw with great avidity. (See plate annexed).</P>

<P>23d. The black&s;mith's &s;hop, which was built of common bru&s;h wood, was burnt down. Very fortunately for us, the bellows and the other tools were, through the exertion of the people, &s;aved. To effect this was no ea&s;y point, as, in the cour&s;e of three or four minutes, the wood being very dry, every part of the &s;hop was in flames.</P>

<P>29th. One of the convicts was met by &s;ome of the natives, who wounded him very &s;everely in the brea&s;t and head with their &s;pears. They would undoubtedly have de&s;troyed him had he not plunged into the &s;ea, near which he happened to be, and by that means &s;aved him&s;elf. When he was brought to the ho&s;pital he was
<PB N="189" REF="219">very faint from the lo&s;s of blood, which had flowed plentifully from his wounds. A piece of a broken &s;pear had entered through the &s;calp and under his ear, &s;o that the extraction gave him great pain. Their &s;pears are made of a kind of cane which grows out of the tree that produces the yellow gum; they are ten or twelve feet long; pointed, and &s;ometimes barbed, with a piece of the &s;ame cane or the teeth of fi&s;h. The&s;e they throw, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;nort &s;tick already mentioned, which has a &s;hell made fa&s;t to the end of it with the yellow gum. With this gum they likewi&s;e fa&s;ten their barbs to their &s;pears and fi&s;h-gigs. The latter of the&s;e differ from the former by having four prongs, and being always barbed; which is not generally the ca&s;e with the &s;pears. Their &s;pears, the only weapon they are ever &s;een to have that may be con&s;idered in any degree as dangerous, they throw thirty or forty yards with an unerring preci&s;ion. When equipped for any exploit, they are al&s;o armed with a &s;hield made of the bark of a tree, with which they very dexterou&s;ly ward off any thing thrown at them. An humble kind of &s;cymitar; a bludgeon, or club, about twenty inches long, with a large and pointed end;
<PB N="190" REF="220">and &s;ometimes a &s;tone hatchet; make up the catalogue of their military implements.</P>
<P>We this day &s;hot a <HI>Knob-fronted Bee-eater;</HI> (See plate annexed). This is about the &s;ize of a blackbird; the plumage mo&s;tly brown above and white beneath; the head and upper part of the neck are &s;paringly covered with narrow feathers, almo&s;t like hairs; but the fore part of the neck and brea&s;t are furni&s;hed with long ones, of a white colour and pointed at the ends; the tail is pretty long, and the feathers tipped with white; the bill is about one inch in length, and pale; but what is mo&s;t remarkable, on the forehead, ju&s;t at the ba&s;e of the bill, is a &s;hort blunt knob, about a quarter of an inch in length, and of a browni&s;h colour; the tongue is nearly of the length of the bill, and bri&s;tly at the end; the legs are brown. This inhabits <HI>New South Wales,</HI> and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a non-de&s;cript &s;pecies.</P>
<P>This day three canoes, with a man and woman in each, came behind the point on which the ho&s;pital is built, to fi&s;h. I went over to them, as did two other gentlemen, my a&s;&s;i&s;tants, without their &s;hewing any fear at our coming; on the contrary, they manife&s;ted a friendly confidence.

<PB N="191" REF="222">We gave them &s;ome bread, which they received with appa|rent plea&s;ure, but did not eat any of it while in our pre&s;ence. We likewi&s;e pre&s;ented them with a looking-gla&s;s, but this they received with indifference, and feemed to hold in no kind of e&s;timation. I gave one of the women a pocket handkerchief, which &s;he immediately tied round hen head, and &s;hewed great &s;atisfaction. She had a young child between her knees in the canoe, (the way in which they always carry their infants), for whom &s;he &s;olicited &s;omething, in the mo&s;t &s;uppliant tone of voice I ever heard. The only thing I had about me was a narrow &s;lip of linen, which I gave her; and trifling as it was, &s;he appeared to be perfectly &s;atisfied with it, and bound it round the child's head. She would not come out of the came, though along-&s;ide the rocks; but the man quitted it, and &s;hewed us &s;ome wild figs that grew near at hand. Such as were green and unripe he did not pull; but, after &s;ome &s;earch, having found one that was tolerably ripe, he made me pluck it and put it into his mouth. He eat it with an apparent reli&s;h, and &s;macked his lips, after he had &s;wallowed it, to convince us how good it was.</P>

As &s;oon as he had di&s;covered it, he took it by the horns, and, as well as we could under&s;tand him, he was extremely inqui&s;itive and anxious to know what it was. When his curio&s;ity was &s;atisfied, he went into the canoe, where the woman had been waiting for him. About ten or twenty yards from the &s;hore, among the long gra&s;s, in the &s;hallow water, he &s;truck and took with his fi&s;h-gig &s;everal good fi&s;h; an acqui&s;ition to which, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, it being cold and wet, we were unequal. While he was engaged in watching for them, both he and the woman chewed &s;omething, which they frequently &s;pit into the water; and which appeared to us, from his immediately &s;triking a fi&s;h, to be a lure. While they were thus employed, one of the gentlemen with me &s;ung &s;ome &s;ongs; and when he had done, the females in the canoes either &s;ung one of their own &s;ongs, or imitated him, in which they &s;ucceeded beyond conception. Any thing &s;poken by us they mo&s;t accurately recited, and this in a manner of which we fell greatly &s;hort in our attempts to repeat their language after them.</P>

<P>16th. A convict who has been out gathering what they called &s;weet tea, about a mile from the camp, met a party of the natives, con&s;i&s;ting of fourteen, by whom he was beaten, and al&s;o &s;lightly wounded with the &s;hell|&s;tick u&s;ed in throwing their &s;pears; they then made him
<PB N="195" REF="227">&s;trip, and would have taken from him his clothes, and probably his life, had it not been for the report of two mu&s;quets; which they no &s;ooner heard, than they ran away. This party were returning from the wood with cork, which they had been cutting, either for their canoes or huts; and had with them no other in&s;truments than tho&s;e that were nece&s;&s;ary for the bu&s;ine&s;s on which they were engaged; &s;uch as a &s;tone hatchet, and the &s;hell &s;tick before mentioned. Had they been armed with any other weapons, the convict would probably have lo&s;t his life.</P>
<P>That which we call the &s;weet tea, is a creeping kind of vine, running to a great extent along the ground; the &s;talk is not &s;o thick as the &s;malle&s;t honey-&s;uckle; nor is the leaf &s;o large as the common bay leaf, though &s;omething &s;imilar to it; and the ta&s;te is &s;weet, exactly like the liquorice root of the &s;hops. Of this the convicts and &s;oldiers make an infu&s;ion which is tolerably plea&s;ant, and &s;erves as no bad &s;uccedaneum for tea. Indeed were it to be met with in greater abundance, it would be found very beneficial to tho&s;e poor creatures, who&s;e con&s;tant diet is &s;alt provi&s;ions. In u&s;ing it for medical purpo&s;es,
<PB N="196" REF="228">I have found it to be a good pectoral, and, as I before ob&s;erved, not at all unplea&s;ant. <HI>(See Plate annexed).</HI> We have al&s;o a kind of &s;hrub in this country re&s;embling the common broom; which produces a &s;mall berry like a white currant, but, in ta&s;te, more &s;imilar to a very four green goo&s;eberry. This has proved a good anti&s;corbutic; but I am &s;orry to add, that the quantity to be met with is far from &s;ufficient to remove the &s;curvy. That di&s;order &s;till prevails with great violence, nor can we at pre&s;ent find any remedy again&s;t it, notwith&s;tanding that the coun|try produces &s;everal &s;orts of plants and &s;hrubs, which, in this place, are con&s;idered as tolerable vegetables, and u&s;ed in common. The mo&s;t plentiful, is a plant growing on the &s;ea &s;hore, greatly re&s;embling &s;age. Among it are often to be found &s;amphire, and a kind of wild &s;pinage, be&s;ides a &s;mall &s;hrub which we di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of the vegetable tree, and the leaves of which prove rather a plea&s;ant &s;ub&s;titute for vegetables.</P>

<P>22d. His Excellency Governor Phillip, Lieutenant George John&s;ton, his Adjutant of Orders, Lieutenant Cre&s;&s;well of the Marines, my&s;elf, and &s;ix &s;oldiers, landed in Manly Cove, in order to examine the coa&s;t to Broken Bay. At a
<PB N="197" REF="229">&s;hort di&s;tance from the &s;hore, we &s;aw &s;ixteen canoes, with two per&s;ons in each, and in &s;ome three, employed in fi&s;hing. They &s;eemed to take very little notice as we pa&s;&s;ed them, &s;o very intent were they on the bu&s;ine&s;s in which they were engaged. On our landing, we &s;aw &s;ixty more of the natives, about two hundred yards di&s;tant from us. Some of them immediately came up to us, and were very friendly. A black man, who carried our tents, gave two of them a &s;tocking each, with which they &s;eemed much plea&s;ed; and pointing to the naked leg, expre&s;&s;ed a great de&s;ire to have that al&s;o clothed. The morning was &s;o cold, that the&s;e poor wretches &s;tood &s;hivering on the beach, and appeared to be very &s;en&s;ible of the comfort and advantage of being clothed.</P>
<P>We &s;ent back our boats, and proceeded northward along the coa&s;t about &s;ix miles, where we were forced to halt for near two hours, until the tide had run out of a lagoon, or piece of water, &s;o as to admit of its being forded. While we were detained here, an old native came to us, and, in the mo&s;t friendly manner, pointed out the &s;hallowe&s;t part of the water we had to cro&s;s; but the tide ran with too much rapidity at that time for us to attempt it. After we
<PB N="198" REF="230">had waded through, one of our company &s;hot a very fine duck, which we had dre&s;&s;ed for &s;upper, on a little eminence by the &s;ide of a cabbage tree &s;wamp, about half a mile from the run of the tide. Here the whole party got as much cabbage, to eat with their &s;alt provi&s;ions, as they cho&s;e. While we had been detained by the tide, &s;everal natives were on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, who al&s;o pointed out to us the &s;hoale&s;t water, and appeared, by their &s;igns and ge&s;tures, to wi&s;h us very much to come over; but before the tide was &s;ufficiently low, they went away. One of them wore a &s;kin of a reddi&s;h colour round his &s;houlders. Near the place where we pitched our tent, we &s;aw &s;everal quails exactly like tho&s;e in England. I fired four or five times at them, but without &s;ucce&s;s, as my &s;hot was too large.</P>

As &s;oon as the dew was off the gra&s;s, we began our march, and about twelve o'clock fell in with the &s;outh branch of <HI>Broken Bay:</HI> but finding the country round this part very rugged, and the di&s;tance too great for our &s;tock of provi&s;ions, we returned to the &s;ea &s;hore, in order to examine the &s;outh part of the entrance into the bay. This, like every other part of the country we have &s;een, had a very indifferent a&s;pect. From the entrance
<PB N="199" REF="231">of <HI>Port Jack&s;on</HI> to <HI>Broken Bay,</HI> in fome places from fifty to a hundred, in others to two hundred yards di&s;tant from the &s;ea, the coa&s;t indeed is very plea&s;ant, and tolerably clear of wood; the earth a kind of adhe&s;ive clay, covered with a thick and &s;hort &s;our gra&s;s.</P>
<P>All along the &s;hore we met the natives, who &s;eem to have no fixed re&s;idence or abode; but, indi&s;criminately, whenever they meet with a hut, or, what is more common, a convenient excavation or hole in the rocks, take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for the time. In one of their huts, at <HI>Broken Bay,</HI> which was con&s;tructed of bark, and was one of the be&s;t I had ever met with, we &s;aw two very well made nets, &s;ome fi&s;hing lines not inferior to the nets, &s;ome &s;pears, a &s;tone hatchet of a very &s;uperior make to what they u&s;ually have, together with two vehicles for carrying water, one of cork, the other made out of the knot of a large tree hollowed. In this hut there were two pieces of coar&s;e linen, which they mu&s;t have obtained from &s;ome of our people, and every thing about it be&s;poke more comfort and convenience than I had ob&s;erved in any other. A little way from it we fell in with a large party of natives, whom we &s;uppo&s;ed to be the proprietors;
<PB N="200" REF="232">they were armed with &s;pears and &s;tone hatchets. One of the latter they very earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to exchange for one of ours. Though we would readily have obliged them, it was not in our power to comply with their wi&s;hes, as we had only a &s;ufficient number wherewith to cut wood for our own fires. However, notwith&s;tanding our refu&s;al, they parted from us without appearing at all di&s;&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>As we proceeded along the &s;andy beach, we gathered &s;ome beans, which grew on a &s;mall creeping &s;ub&s;tance not unlike a vine. They were well ta&s;ted, and very &s;imilar to the Engli&s;h long-pod bean. At the place where we halted, we had them boiled, and we all eat very heartily of them. Half an hourafter, the governor and I were &s;eized with a violent vomiting. We drank warm water, which, carrying the load freely from our &s;tomachs, gave us immediate relief. Two other gentlemen of the party ate as freely of them as we had done, without feeling the &s;malle&s;t incon|venience or bad effect. About this place we got &s;ome ra&s;berries; but they had not that plea&s;ant tartne&s;s peculiar to tho&s;e in Europe.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>24th. We returned by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age, along the coa&s;t,
<PB N="201" REF="233">without &s;eeing any objects worth notice, until we came to a convenient &s;pot to encamp for the night, where there was great plenty of cabbage trees, and tolerable water; a circum&s;tance, as I have already ob&s;erved, not generally to be met with in this country, except on the &s;ea coa&s;t; and even there by no means in abundance.</P>
<P>While &s;oup was making of &s;ome birds we had lately killed (which proved very good), and every thing was getting ready for the night, the governor, the two other gentlemen, and my&s;elf, took our guns, and a&s;cended a hill ju&s;t above us. From this eminence we &s;aw the &s;outh|ern branch of Broken Bay, which ran far into the country. During our return, we picked up, in the di&s;tance of about half a mile, twenty-five flowers of plants and &s;hurbs of different genera and &s;pecies, &s;pecimens of which I have tran&s;mitted to Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> particularly the Red Gum Tree. (See Plate annexed). On the &s;pot where we encamped, the gra&s;s was long, dry, and &s;our; and in &s;uch abundance, that we &s;et it on fire all around, for fear the natives &s;hould &s;urpri&s;e us in the night by doing the &s;ame; a cu&s;tom in which they &s;eem always happy to indulge them&s;elves.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<P>25th. We &s;et off early in the morning to look at the
<PB N="202" REF="234">branch of Broken Bay which we had &s;een the evening before; and were led to it by a path not very much frequented. At the head of this branch we found a fre&s;h water river, which took its ri&s;e a little above, out of a &s;wamp. Such is the origin and &s;ource of every river we have yet di&s;covered in this country; though few, when compared to tho&s;e in any other part of the world. It is very extraordinary that in all this exten&s;ive tract, a living &s;pring has not yet been explored. On this river we &s;aw many ducks and teal. Mr. Cre&s;&s;well &s;hot one of the latter, and I &s;hot one of the former. They were both well ta&s;ted, and good of their kind. At the head of this branch we found the country rough and impa&s;&s;able. Having followed the cour&s;e of the river to its origin, we that day returned to Manly Cove, where we &s;urpri&s;ed two old men, an old woman, a grown-up girl, and thirteen children, in a hut. When the children &s;aw us approach, they all gathered them&s;elves clo&s;ely together around the girl; they cried, and &s;eemed much terrified. The old men &s;howed &s;uch di&s;like to our looking at them, that the governor and the re&s;t of the party withdrew to &s;ome little di&s;tance to dine. Some of the children, on &s;eeing all the party gone but
<PB N="203" REF="235">my&s;elf and another gentleman, began to laugh, and thus proved that their fears had vani&s;ned. When we joined the re&s;t of the party, the old man followed us in a very friendly manner, and took part of every kind of provi&s;ion we had, but he ate none of it in our &s;ight. The women and children &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance, and beckoned to us when the men, of whom they feemed to &s;tand in very great dread, had turned their backs.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had dined, and refre&s;hed our&s;elves, the governor, by him&s;elf, went down to them, and di&s;tributed &s;ome pre&s;ents among them, which &s;oon gained their friend&s;hip and confidence. By this time &s;ixteen canoes, that were out fi&s;hing, came clo&s;e to the &s;pot where we were, and there lay on their paddles, which they managed with wonderful dexterity and addre&s;s; mimicking us, and indulging in their own merriment. After many &s;igns and entreaties, one of the women ventured to the governor, who was by him&s;elf, and with &s;eemingly great timidity, took from him &s;ome &s;mall fi&s;hing lines and hooks; articles which they hold in great e&s;timation. This made her le&s;s fearful; and in a little time &s;he became perfectly free and unre&s;trained. Her conduct influenced many others,
<PB N="204" REF="236">who came on &s;hore for what they could procure. Many of them were painted about the head, brea&s;t, and &s;houlders, with &s;ome white &s;ub&s;tance. None of tho&s;e who were thus ornamented came on &s;hore, till by &s;igns we made them under&s;tand that we intended to offer them &s;ome pre&s;ents; and even then, only one of them ventured. To this per&s;on Lieutenant Cre&s;&s;well gave a white pocket hand|kerchief, with which &s;he &s;eemeds much plea&s;ed. Every gentleman now &s;ingled out a female, and pre&s;ented her with &s;ome trinkets, not forgetting, at the &s;ame time, to be&s;tow gifts upon &s;ome of her family, whom &s;he took con&s;iderable pains to make known, le&s;t they &s;hould fall into the hands of &s;uch as did not belong to her. It was remarked that all the women and children, (an old woman excepted) had the little finger of the left hand taken off at the &s;econd joint; the &s;tump of which was as well covered as if the operation had been performed by a &s;urgeon.</P>
<P>While we were thus employed among the women, a body of men came out of the woods with a new canoe, made of cork. It was one of the be&s;t we had ob|&s;erved in this country; though it fell very &s;hort of tho&s;e
<PB N="205" REF="237">which I have &s;een among the American or Mu&s;quito-&s;hore Indians; who, in improvements of every kind, the Indians of this country are many centuries behind. The men had al&s;o with them &s;ome new paddles, &s;pears, and fi&s;h|gigs, which they had ju&s;t been making. They readily &s;howed us the u&s;e of every thing they had with them. Indeed they always behave with an apparent civility when they fall in with men that are armed; but when they meet per&s;ons unarmed, they &s;eldom fail to take every advantage of them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e females who were arrived at the age of puberty did not wear a covering; but all the female children and likewi&s;e the girls wore a &s;light kind of covering before them, made of the fur of the kangaroo, twi&s;ted into threads. While we went towards the party of men that came out of the woods with the new canoe, all the women landed, and began to broil their fi&s;h, of which they had a large quantity. There &s;eemed to be no har|mony or ho&s;pitality among them. However, the female to whom I paid the mo&s;t attention gave me, but not un|till I a&s;ked her for it, &s;ome of the fi&s;h which &s;he was
<PB N="206" REF="238">eating. She had thrown it on the fire, but it was &s;carcely warm.</P>
<P>Many of the women were &s;trait, well formed, and lively. My companion continued to exhibit a number of coquetti&s;h airs while I was decorating her head, neck, and arms, with my pocket and neck handkerchiefs, which I tore into ribbons, as if de&s;irous of multiplying two pre&s;ents into &s;everal. Having nothing left, except the buttons of my coat, on her admiring them, I cut them away, and with a piece of &s;tring tied them round her wai&s;t. Thus orna|mented, and thus delighted with her new acquirements, &s;he turned from me with a look of inexpre&s;&s;ible arch|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Before the arrival of the boats, which was late, the natives pointed to a hawk, and made &s;igns to us to &s;hoot it. It had alighted upon an adjoining tree, and the governor de&s;ired that I would bring it down. The report of the gun frightened them very much. Some ran away; but on perceiving that no harm was intended again&s;t them, they returned, and were highly plea&s;ed to &s;ee the hawk pre&s;ented by the governor to a young girl, who appeared
<PB N="207" REF="239">to be the daughter of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed among&s;t them.</P>
<P>While the boats were preparing for our reception, an old woman, perfectly grey with age, &s;olicited us very much for &s;ome pre&s;ent; and in order to make us comply, threw her&s;elf, before all her companions, into the mo&s;t indecent attitudes.</P>
<P>The cock&s;wain of the boat informed us, that while he was waiting for our return, the day before, two parties of the natives met, and commenced ho&s;tilities again&s;t each other. The man thus de&s;cribed the manner in which this encounter was carried on. A champion from each party, armed with a &s;pear and a &s;hield, pre&s;&s;ed forwards be|fore the re&s;t; and, as &s;oon as a favourable opportunity offered (till which he advanced and retreated by turns), threw his &s;pear, and then retired; when another imme|diately took his place, going through the &s;ame manoeuvres; and in this manner was the conflict carried on for more than two hours. The boats crew and two mid&s;hipmen, who &s;aw the whole of the proceeding, perceived that one of the natives walked off with a &s;pear in his &s;ide. During the engagement, the women belonging to them, who &s;tood
<PB N="208" REF="240">at &s;ome di&s;tance, di&s;covered &s;trong marks of concern, and &s;creamed loudly when any of the combatants appeared to be wounded. As the boat was returning clo&s;e along &s;hore, a &s;pear was thrown at the people by &s;ome of the natives, who were lurking behind the trees and rocks. It was hurled with &s;uch force, that it flew a con&s;iderable way over the boat, although we were between thirty and forty yards from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>It was late in the evening before we arrived in Sydney Cove; and as &s;oon as the governor landed, he was informed that a gold mine had been di&s;covered, near the entrance of the harbour, by a convict. During his excellency's ab&s;ence, the convict had made this di&s;covery known to the lieutenant governor and the judge advocate; for which, he &s;aid, that he hoped and expected to have his freedom, and a pecuniary reward. The gentlemen to whom he applied an&s;wered, that they could not promi&s;e to grant his reque&s;t until he &s;hould have put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mine; but, that they were well a&s;&s;ured that the governor would be&s;tow on him a proper recompence, after &s;ufficient proof of the di&s;covery. A boat was, in con&s;equence, ordered from the Sirius, to carry him and Captain Campbell down to the
<PB N="209" REF="241">place where he declared that the mine was &s;ituated. At their landing, he begged leave to withdraw a little, on &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion; when, in&s;tead of returning to Captain Campbell, he went back to the camp, and waiting on the lieutenant governor and judge advocate, a&s;&s;erted that he had put Captain Campbell in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mine, who had di&s;patched him over land for another officer and a proper guard. His account not being doubted, he was well fed and treated; and Lieutenant Paulden, with a guard and all nece&s;&s;ary articles, was ordered to attend him to the place. But, before they could &s;et out, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of all, Captain Campbell arrived, and unravelled the whole of this extraordinary deception. This produced an unexpected revolution. In&s;tead of receiving a reward for his golden di&s;coveries, the impo&s;tor was immediately taken into cu&s;tody, with two others, &s;uppo&s;ed to be concerned in carrying on the artifice. The next day he was examined, with great privacy and &s;trictne&s;s; but no &s;atisfactory elucidation being obtained from him, he was ordered to be &s;everely whipped. Sub&s;equently to this puni&s;hment, of which he was prepared to expect a weekly repetition, between the intervals of hard labour, and to be
<PB N="210" REF="242">loaded ince&s;&s;antly with heavy irons, during the time of his remaining in the colony, he mo&s;t audaciou&s;ly per&s;i&s;ted in endeavouring to maintain the delu&s;ion, and declared that if an officer was &s;ent with him, he would &s;how him the mine; adding, that he was heartily &s;orry for what had happened. Accordingly, he was &s;uffered to accompany Lieutenant G. John&s;ton, the Governor's Adjutant of Orders, to the place in que&s;tion. Before the boat had reached its de&s;tination Mr. John&s;ton argued with him, yet not with|out prote&s;ting, that if he either attempted to deceive <HI>him</HI> as he had impo&s;ed upon Captain Campbell, or pre&s;umed to move five yards from him and his party, he would in&s;tantly order him to be &s;hot. Finding that this officer was not to be trifled with, but &s;eemed determined, he acknowledged that it was unnece&s;&s;ary to proceed any farther; that he was ignorant of the exi&s;tence of any &s;uch mine, and that the &s;pecimens &s;hown by him were only a compo&s;ition of bra&s;s and gold, which he had filed down and melted. Mr. John&s;ton brought him back; when he was again examined, and ordered to be puni&s;hed. It is needle&s;s to add that no further di&s;covery was made. He is now at liberty. He is, however, obliged to wear a large <HI>R</HI> on
<PB N="211" REF="243">his back. The man, who&s;e name is Daily, appears in&s;ane; yet others cannot be per&s;uaded that he is a lunatic, but are rather of opinion that he is a de&s;igning mi&s;creant, and that time will di&s;clo&s;e a deep-laid &s;cheme, which he had planned for &s;ome purpo&s;e hitherto undi&s;covered. For my own part, I freely confe&s;s, that I cannot coincide with their &s;entiments. He was &s;o artful as to circulate a report that he had &s;old &s;everal pounds weight of the ore to the ma&s;ter of the Golden Grove, and &s;ome of his &s;eamen. This rumour was received with &s;uch credulity, that, in con&s;equence of the impre&s;&s;ion which it made, none of the &s;ailors were &s;uffered to leave the &s;hip after a certain hour in the evening. In a word, &s;o many ridiculous circum&s;tances attended this affair, that to attempt a complete enumeration of them would prove not le&s;s difficult than unintere&s;ting.</P>

<P>26th. The Supply arrived from Norfolk I&s;land, after a long and rough pa&s;&s;age. She had landed, but neither in apparent &s;afety nor with facility, the &s;tores which &s;he carried to that place: and, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, I am &s;orry to add, that the hazard of landing and embarking from this little i&s;land is &s;o very great, that Mr. Cunning|ham, a mid&s;hipman of the Sirius (who re&s;ided on it with
<PB N="212" REF="244">Lieutenant King, the &s;uperintendant), was lo&s;t, with three &s;eamen, in a boat that was &s;wamped by the &s;urf, which on every part of the coa&s;t runs high, and beats again&s;t the &s;hore with great violence; &s;o that I much fear, from the difficulty of acce&s;s, and its &s;ituation, it never will prove of any great con&s;equence, although it promi&s;ed &s;ome advan|tages; particularly in furni&s;hing us with pine trees, which grow here to a &s;ize nearly equal to tho&s;e of Norway. In the whole i&s;land there is not a harbour capable of admitting even &s;o &s;mall a ve&s;&s;el as the Supply, and the anchorage on every part of the coa&s;t is equally bad.</P>
<P>The i&s;land produces a kind of gladiolus luteus, or iris palu&s;tris, of which, as may be &s;een by the &s;pecimens &s;ent Mr. Wil&s;on, exceeding good hemp is to be made; and which is to be procured in any quantity, the plants growing in great abundance throughout the whole i&s;land. The foregoing articles, were the i&s;land larger and more ea&s;y of acce&s;s, with even a tolerable harbour, might, in any other country, be of the fir&s;t con&s;equence to a maritime nation. But from every information which I have gained from the officers and crew of the Supply, the procuring of this bene|ficial acqui&s;ition is at pre&s;ent &s;omewhat doubtful. The
<PB N="213" REF="245">people &s;ettled upon it, when they can venture out, get great plenty of fi&s;h; and, at certain &s;ea&s;ons, turtle. In the i&s;land al&s;o are pigeons, as tame as dome&s;tic fowls; and the &s;oil &s;eems well adapted for the growth of all kinds of grain and vegetables. It produces a wild banana, or plantain tree, which, by cultivation, may a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;ettlers, as a &s;ucce|daneum for bread: and I am not without hopes that we &s;hall be able to make &s;ome additions from thence to &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries of life as may in time be produced here.</P>
<P>A few days &s;ince the natives landed near the ho&s;pital, where &s;ome goats belonging to the Supply were brow&s;ing; when they killed, with their &s;pear, a kid, and carried it away. Within this fortnight, they have al&s;o killed a he-goat of the governor's. Whenever an opportunity offered, they have &s;eldom failed to de&s;troy whatever &s;tock they could &s;eize upon unob&s;erved. They have been equally ready to attack the convicts, on every occa&s;ion which pre&s;ented it&s;elf; and &s;ome of them have become victims to the&s;e &s;avages. I have already ob&s;erved that they &s;tand much in fear of a mu&s;quet, and therefore they very &s;eldom approach any per&s;on by whom it is carried; and their apprehen&s;ions are almo&s;t equally great when they perceive a red garment.</P>

<P>10th. A general court martial was convened by warrant from the governor. When the members, with the deputy judge advocate, were a&s;&s;embled, they gave it as their opinion, that notwith&s;tanding the governor has full power and authority to grant and hold court martials among regular troops; yet, as a corps of marines, under the influence of a particular code of laws, and in&s;tructions from the Admiralty, and only amenable to that board, they could not proceed to trial; the board of Admiralty not having delegated any part of their authority over the marine corps, particularly that of holding court martials, to the governor; neither did any part of the act of Parliament for forming a colony in New South Wales contain directions relative to that &s;ubject.

<HEAD>THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF BANKSIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE fine&s;t new genus hitherto found in <HI>New Holland</HI> has been de&s;tined by <HI>Linnoeus,</HI> with great propriety, to tran&s;mit to po&s;terity the name of Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph Banks,</HI> who fir&s;t di&s;covered it in his celebrated voyage round the world. It is indeed one of the mo&s;t magnificent genera with which we are acquainted, being nearly allied to <HI>Protea</HI> and <HI>Embothrium</HI> in habit and botanical characters, but &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed from both by its fruit. Four &s;pecies of <HI>Bank&s;ia</HI> are de&s;cribed in the <HI>Supplementum Plan|tarum</HI> of <HI>Linnoeus;</HI> &s;pecimens of which we have &s;een in his <HI>Herbarium</HI> now in thepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dr. <HI>Smith</HI> of <HI>Marlborough Street;</HI> and we have depo&s;ited with the &s;ame gentleman
<PB N="222" REF="254">&s;pecimens of all the plants we are about to de&s;cribe in this work. Dr. <HI>Gaertner,</HI> in his admirable book on fruits and &s;eeds, has figured the fruit of &s;everal <HI>Bank&s;ias,</HI> &s;ome of them de&s;cribed by <HI>Linnaeus.</HI> Having had his plates, with the names, engraved before he &s;aw the <HI>Supplementum</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> his nomenclature differs from that of the la&s;t mentioned author; but he quotes his &s;ynonyms in the letter pre&s;s. We mention this, that he may not be accu&s;ed of <HI>wantonly</HI> changing <HI>Linnaean</HI> names, and that for the wor&s;e, as it would appear to any one uninformed of this circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>The character of the genus is very badly made out in <HI>Linnaeus. Gaertner</HI> has greatly corrected it, but it is &s;till a doubt whether the flowers are con&s;tantly <HI>monopetalous</HI> or <HI>tetrapetalous,</HI> nor have we materials &s;ufficient to remove this difficulty. All we can &s;ay is, that <HI>Bank&s;ia</HI> is next in natural arrangement to <HI>Protea,</HI> from which it is e&s;&s;entially di&s;tingui&s;hed by having an hard woody bivalve cap&s;ule, containing two winged &s;eeds, with a moveable membranous partition between them. It is &s;trangely mi&s;placed in <HI>Murray</HI>'s 14th edition of <HI>Sy&s;tema Vegetabilium,</HI> being put between <HI>Ludwigia</HI> and <HI>Oldenlandia!</HI></P>

<P>(See Plate annexed.)</P>
<P>This tree grows to the height of more than an hundred feet, and is above thirty feet in circumference. The bark is very &s;mooth, like that of the poplar. The younger branches are long and &s;lender, angulated near the top, but as they grow older the angles di&s;appear. Their bark is &s;mooth, and of a reddi&s;h brown. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, pointed, very entire, &s;mooth on both &s;ides, and remarkably unequal, or oblique, at their ba&s;e; the veins alternate and not very con&s;picuous. The whole &s;urface of both &s;ides of the leaves is marked with numerous minute re&s;inous &s;pots, in which the e&s;&s;ential oil re&s;ides.

Each cap&s;ule is about the &s;ize of an hawthorn berry, globular, but as it were cut off at the top, rugged on the out&s;ide, hard and woody, and of a dark brown colour. At the top is a large orifice, which &s;hews the internal part of the cap&s;ule divided into four cells, and having a &s;quare column in the center, from which the partitions of the cell ari&s;e. The&s;e partitions extend to the rim of the cap&s;ule, and terminate in four &s;mall projections, which look like the teeth of a calyx. The &s;eeds are numerous, &s;mall, and angular.</P>
<P>The name of Peppermint Tree has been given to this plant by Mr. WHITE on account of the very great re&s;em|blance between the e&s;&s;ential oil drawn from its leaves and that obtained from the Peppermint <HI>(Mentha piperita)</HI> which grows in England. This oil was found by Mr. WHITE to be much more efficacious in removing all cholicky complaints than that of the Engli&s;h Peppermint, which he attributes to its being le&s;s pungent and more aromatic. A quart of the oil has been &s;ent by him to Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on.</HI></P>

THE RED GUM TREE. EUCALYPTUS RESINIFERA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Floribus pedunculatis, calyptr&acirc; conic&acirc; acut&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P>(See Plate annexed)</P>
<P>This is a very large and lo&s;ty tree, much exceeding the Engli&s;h Oak in &s;ize. The wood is extremely brittle, and, from the large quantity of re&s;inous gum which it contains, is of little u&s;e but for firewood. Of the leaves Mr. WHITE has given no account, nor &s;ent any &s;pecimens. The flowers grow in little clu&s;ters, or rather umbels, about ten in each, and every flower has a proper partial foot&s;talk, about a quarter of an inch in length, be&s;ides the general one. The general foot&s;talk is remarkably compre&s;&s;ed <HI>(anceps),</HI> and the partial ones are &s;o in &s;ome degree. We have perceived nothing like <HI>bracteae,</HI> or floral leaves. The flowers appear to be yellowi&s;h, and are of a very &s;ingular &s;tructure. The calyx is hemi&s;pherical, perfectly entire in the margin, and afterwards becomes the cap&s;ule. On the top of the calyx, rather within the margin, &s;tands a conical pointed calyptra,
<PB N="232" REF="273">of the &s;ame colour with the calyx, and about as long as that and the foot&s;talk taken together. This calyptra, which is the e&s;&s;ential mark of the genus, and differs from that of the <HI>Eucalyptus obliqua</HI> of <HI>L'Heritier</HI> only in being conical and acute, in&s;tead of hemi&s;pherical, is perfectly entire, and never &s;plits or divides, though it is analogous to the corolla of other plants. When it is removed, we perceive a great number of red &s;tamina, &s;tanding in a conical ma&s;s, which before the calyptra was taken off, were completely covered by it, and filled its in&s;ide. The <HI>Antherae</HI> are &s;mall and red. In the center of the&s;e &s;tamina is a &s;ingle &s;tyle or pointal, ri&s;ing a little above them, and terminated by a blunt &s;tigma. The &s;tamina are very re&s;inous and aromatic. They are in&s;erted into the margin of the calyx, &s;o that the genus is properly placed by Mr. <HI>L'Heritier</HI> in the cla&s;s <HI>Ico&s;andria.</HI> The&s;e &s;tamina and &s;tyle being removed, and the germen cut acro&s;s about the middle of the calyx, it appears to be divided into three cells, and no more, as far as we have examined, each containing the rudiments of one or more &s;eeds, for the number cannot with certainty be determined. Whether the calyptra in this &s;pecies falls off, as in that de&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>L'Heritier,</HI> or be permanent,
<PB N="233" REF="274">we cannot tell. From one &s;pecimen &s;ent by Mr. WHITE, the latter &s;hould &s;eem to be the ca&s;e; and that the calyx &s;wells and ri&s;es around it nearly to the top, making a pear|&s;haped fruit, with the point of the calyptra &s;ticking out at its apex; but as this appears only in a &s;ingle flower, and none of the others are at all advanced towards ripening &s;eed, the flower in que&s;tion may po&s;&s;ibly be in a morbid &s;tate, owing to the attacks of &s;ome in&s;ect. (<HI>See Fig.</HI> g.) Future ob&s;ervations will determine this point. We have been the more diffu&s;e in our de&s;cription on account of the &s;ingularity of the genus, and the value of the plant.</P>
<P>On making inci&s;ions in the trunk of this tree, large quantities of red re&s;inous juice are obtained, &s;ometimes even more than &s;ixty gallons from a &s;ingle tree. When this juice is dried, it becomes a very powerfully a&s;tringent gum-re&s;in, of a red colour, much re&s;embling that known in the &s;hops by the name of Kino, and, for all medical purpo&s;es, fully as efficacious. Mr. WHITE admini&s;tered it to a great number of patients in the dy&s;entery, which prevailed much &s;oon after the landing of the convicts, and in no one in&s;tance found it to fail. This gum-re&s;in di&s;&s;olves almo&s;t entirely in &s;pirit of wine, to which it gives a blood red tincture. Water

From the center of the head of leaves ari&s;es a &s;ingle foot&s;talk, eighteen or twenty feet in height, perfectly &s;traight and erect, very much re&s;embling the &s;ugar cane, and terminating in a &s;pike of a &s;piral form, not unlike an ear of wheat. This large &s;tem or foot&s;talk is u&s;ed by the natives for making &s;pears and fi&s;h gigs, being pointed with the teeth of fi&s;h or other animals, &s;ome of which are repre&s;ented, in the plate of Implements, from originals now in Mr. Wil&s;on's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

The varni&s;h which it makes with either is very weak, and of little u&s;e. With re&s;pect to its medicinal qualities, Mr. White has found it, in many ca&s;es, a good pectoral medicine, and very bal&s;amic.

<P>This Lizard comes nearer to the Scineus than any I am acquainted with, but is &s;till a di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</P>
<P>In the two &s;pecimens &s;ent over by Mr. WHITE, one had a proce&s;s on the upper part of the tail, near the top, almo&s;t like a &s;upernumerary or forked tail, but which I rather con|ceive to be natural; and as this one was a male, I am inclined to think that this is peculiar to that &s;ex, which would in &s;ome degree have been more clearly made out, if the other, which had not this proce&s;s, had proved a female; but as its being gutted and &s;tuffed before I &s;aw it, prevented my examination, this remains &s;till to be proved: but what makes the conjecture very probable, is, that it is mentioned by Mr. WHITE that &s;ome are without, and &s;ome with this proce&s;s. Now if it was a mon&s;ter, ari&s;ing either from acci|dent, or originally &s;o formed, it would hardly be &s;o com|mon as to be taken notice of. The tail is longer than that of the Scincu&s;es, and not &s;o taper; the animal is of a dark iron-grey colour, which is of different &s;hades in different parts, forming a kind of &s;tripes acro&s;s the back and tail.

<P><PB N="269" REF="339">The Non-de&s;cript Animals of New South Wales occupied a great deal of Mr. WHITE'S attention, and he pre&s;erved &s;everal &s;pecimens of them in &s;pirits, which arrived in England in a very perfect &s;tate. There was no per&s;on to whom the&s;e could be given with &s;o much propriety as Mr. Hunter, he, perhaps, being mo&s;t capable of exa|mining accurately their &s;tructure, and making out their place in the &s;cale of animals; and it is to him that we are indebted for the following ob&s;ervations upon them; in which the anatomical &s;tructure is purpo&s;ely avoided, as being little calculated for the generality of readers of a work of this kind.</P>
<P>It is much to be wi&s;hed that tho&s;e gentlemen who are de&s;irous of obliging their friends, and promoting the &s;tudy of Natural Hi&s;tory, by &s;ending home &s;peci|mens, would endeavour to procure all the information they can relating to &s;uch &s;pecimens as they may collect, more e&s;pecially animals. The &s;ubjects them&s;elves may be valuable, and may partly explain their connection with tho&s;e related to them, &s;o as, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to e&s;tabli&s;h their place in nature, but they cannot do it entirely; they
<PB N="270" REF="340">only give us the form and con&s;truction, but leave us in other re&s;pects to conjecture, many of them requiring further ob&s;ervations relative to their oeconomy. A neglect in procuring this information has left us, almo&s;t to this day, very ignorant of that part of the Natural Hi&s;tory of animals which is the mo&s;t intere&s;ting. The Opo&s;&s;um is a remarkable in&s;tance of this. There is &s;omething in the mode of propagation in this animal that deviates from all others; and although known in &s;ome degree to be extraor|dinary, yet it has never been attempted, where opportunity offered, to complete the inve&s;tigation. I have often endea|voured to breed them in England; I have bought a great many, and my friends have a&s;&s;i&s;ted me by bringing them or &s;ending them alive, yet never could get them to breed; and although po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great many facts re&s;pecting them, I do not believe my information is &s;ufficient to complete the &s;y&s;tem of propagation in this cla&s;s. In collecting animals, even the name given by the natives, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;hould be known; for a name, to a Naturali&s;t, &s;hould mean nothing but that to which it is annexed, having no allu&s;ion to any thing el&s;e; for when it has, it divides the idea. This ob&s;ervation applies particularly to the animals
<PB N="271" REF="341">which have come from New Holland; they are, upon the whole, like no other that we yet know of; but as they have parts in &s;ome re&s;pect &s;imilar to others, names will naturally be given to them expre&s;&s;ive of tho&s;e &s;imilarities; which has already taken place: for in&s;tance, one is called the Kangaroo Rat, but which &s;hould not be called either Kangaroo or Rat; I have therefore adopted &s;uch names as can only be appropriated to each particular animal, conveying no other idea.</P>
<P>Animals admit of being divided into great cla&s;&s;es; but will not &s;o di&s;tinctly admit of &s;ubdivi&s;ion, without inter|fering with each other. Thus the cla&s;s called Quadruped is &s;o well marked, that even the whole is ju&s;tly placed in the &s;ame cla&s;s.

<P>This animal (probably from its &s;ize) was the principal one taken notice of in this i&s;land; the only parts at fir&s;t brought home were &s;ome &s;kins and &s;culls; and I was favour|ed with one of the &s;culls from Sir Jo&s;eph Banks. As the teeth of &s;uch animals as are already known, in &s;ome degree point out their dige&s;tive organs, I was in hopes that I might have been able to form an opinion of the particular tribe of the animals already known, to which the Kangaroo &s;hould belong; but the teeth did not accord with tho&s;e of any one cla&s;s of animals I was acquainted with, therefore I was obliged to wait with patience till I could get the whole: and in many of its other organs the deviation from other animals is not le&s;s than in its teeth. In its mode of propagation it very probably comes nearer to the Opo&s;&s;um than any other animal; although it is not at all &s;imilar to it in other re&s;pects.

The grinders would &s;eem to be a mixture of Hog and Ruminants; the enamel on their external and grind|ing &s;urfaces, rather formed into &s;everal cutting edges, than points. There are &s;ix inci&s;ors in the upper jaw, and only two in the lower; but the&s;e two are &s;o placed as to oppo&s;e tho&s;e of the upper; five grinders in each &s;ide of each jaw, the mo&s;t anterior of which is &s;mall. The pro|portions of &s;ome of the parts of this animal bear no analogy to what is common in mo&s;t others. The di&s;proportions in the length between the fore legs and the hind are very con&s;iderable; al&s;o in their &s;trength; yet perhaps not more than in the Jerboa. This di&s;proportion between the fore legs and the hind is principally in the more adult; for in the very young, about the &s;ize of a half grown rat, they are pretty
<PB N="275" REF="346">well proportioned; which &s;hews that at the early period of life they do not u&s;e progre&s;&s;ive motion. The proportions of the different parts of which the hind legs are compo&s;ed, are very different. The thigh of the Kangaroo is extremely &s;hort, and the leg is very long. The hind foot is uncommon|ly long; on which, to appearance, are placed three toes, the middle toe by much the large&s;t and the &s;tronge&s;t, and looks &s;omething like the long toe of an O&s;trich. The outer toe is next in &s;ize; and what appears to be the inner toe, is two, inclo&s;ed in one &s;kin or covering.</P>
<P>The great toe nail much re&s;embles that of an O&s;trich, as al&s;o the nail of the outer toe; and the inner, which appears to be but one toe, has two &s;mall nails, which are bent and &s;harp.</P>
<P>From the heel, along the under &s;ide of the foot and toe, the &s;kin is adapted for walking upon.</P>
<P>The fore legs, in the full grown Kangaroo, are &s;mall in pro|portion to the hind, or the &s;ize of the animal; the feet, or hands, are al&s;o &s;mall; the &s;kin on the palm is different from that on the back of the hand and fingers. There are five toes or fingers on this foot; the middle rather the large&s;t; the others become very gradually &s;horter, and are all nearly of
<PB N="276" REF="347">the &s;ame &s;hape. The nails are &s;harp, fit for holding. The tail is long in the old; but not &s;o long, in proportion to the &s;ize of the animal, in the young. It would &s;eem to keep pace with the growth of the hind legs, which are the in&s;truments of progre&s;&s;ive motion in this animal; and which would al&s;o &s;hew that the tail is a kind of &s;econd in&s;trument in this action.</P>

<P>This animal is the &s;ize of a rat, and, has very much the appearance of the martin cat, but hardly &s;o long in the body in proportion to its &s;ize.</P>
<P>The head is flat forwards, and broad from &s;ide to &s;ide, e&s;pecially between the eyes and ears; the no&s;e is peaked, and projecting beyond the teeth, which makes the upper jaw appear to be con&s;iderably longer than the lower; the eyes are pretty large; the ears broad, e&s;pecially at their ba&s;e, not becoming regularly narrower to a point, nor with a very &s;mooth edge, and having a &s;mall proce&s;s on the concave, or inner &s;urface, near to the ba&s;e. It has long whi&s;kers from the &s;ides of the cheeks, which begin forwards, near the no&s;e, by &s;mall and &s;hort hairs, and become longer and &s;tronger as they approach the eyes. It has very much the hair of a rat, to which it is &s;imilar in colour; but near to the &s;etting on of the tail, it is of a lighter brown, forming a broad ring round it. The fore feet are &s;horter than the hind, but much in the &s;ame proportion as tho&s;e of the rat; the hind feet are
<PB N="282" REF="359">more flexible. There are five toes on the fore feet, the middle the large&s;t, falling off on each &s;ide nearly equally; but the fore, or inner toe, is rather &s;horte&s;t: they are thin from &s;ide to &s;ide, the nails are pretty broad, laterally, and thin at their ba&s;e; not very long but &s;harp; the animal walks on its whole palm, on which there is no hair. The hind feet are pretty long, and have five toes; that which an&s;wers to our great toe is very &s;hort, and has no nail; the next is the longe&s;t in the whole, falling gradually off to the outer toe; the &s;hape of the hind toes is the &s;ame as in the fore feet, as are likewi&s;e the nails; it walks nearly on the whole foot. The tail is long and covered with long hair, but not all of the &s;ame colour.</P>
<P>The teeth of this creature are different from any other animal yet known. The mouth is full of teeth. The lower jaw narrow in compari&s;on to the upper, more e&s;pecially backwards, which allows of much broader grinders in this jaw than in the lower, and which occa&s;ions the grinders in the upper jaw to project con&s;iderably over tho&s;e in the lower. In the middle the cu&s;pidati oppo&s;e one another, the upper piercers, or holders, go behind tho&s;e of the lower; the &s;econd cla&s;s of inci&s;ors in the lower jaw overtop tho&s;e of
<PB N="283" REF="360">the upper while the two fir&s;t in the lower go within, or behind tho&s;e of the upper. In the upper jaw, before the holders, there are four teeth on each &s;ide, three of which are pointed, the point &s;tanding on the inner &s;urface; and the two in front are longer, &s;tand more obliquely forwards, and appear to be appropriated for a particular u&s;e. The holders are a little way behind the la&s;t fore teeth, to allow tho&s;e of the lower jaw to come between. They are pretty long, the cu&s;pidati on each &s;ide become longer and larger towards the grinders; they are points or cones placed on a broad ba&s;e.</P>
<P>There are four grinders on each &s;ide, the middle two the large&s;t, the la&s;t the lea&s;t; their ba&s;e is a triangle of the &s;ca|lenus kind, or having one angle obtu&s;e and two acute. Their ba&s;e is compo&s;ed of two &s;urfaces, an inner and an outer, divided by proce&s;&s;es or points: it is the inner that the grinders of the lower jaw oppo&s;e, when the mouth is regularly &s;hut. The lower jaw has three fore teeth, or inci|&s;ors, on each &s;ide; the fir&s;t con&s;iderably the large&s;t, project|ing obliquely forwards; the other two of the &s;ame kind, but &s;maller, the la&s;t the &s;malle&s;t.</P>
<P>The holder in this jaw is not &s;o large as in the upper jaw,

<P>The head is flat &s;ideways, but not &s;o much &s;o as the true Scalpris Dentata. The ears are neither long nor &s;hort, but much like tho&s;e of a mou&s;e in proportion to the &s;ize of the animal.</P>
<P>The fore legs are &s;hort in compari&s;on to the hind. There are four toes on the fore feet, the two middle are long, and nearly of equal lengths, with long narrow nails, &s;lightly bent; the two &s;ide toes are &s;hort, and nearly equal in &s;ize, but the outer rather the large&s;t. From the nails on the two middle toes, one would &s;uppo&s;e that the animal burrowed. Their hind legs are long, and it is in their power to &s;tand either on the whole foot, or on the toes only.</P>
<P>On the hind legs are three toes, the middle one large, and the two &s;ide ones &s;hort. The tail is long. The hair on the body is rather thin; it is of two kinds, a fur, and a long hair, which la&s;t becomes exterior from its length. The fur is the fine&s;t, and is compo&s;ed of &s;erpentine hairs; the long hair is &s;tronger, and is al&s;o &s;erpentine, for more than two

<HEAD>THE HEPOONA ROO.</HEAD>
<P>This animal is of the &s;ize of a &s;mall rabbit: it has a broad flat body, the head a good deal re&s;embles that of the &s;quir|rel: the eyes are full, prominent, and large: the ears broad and thin: its legs &s;hort, and its tail very long. Between the fore and hind legs, on each &s;ide, is placed a doubling of the &s;kin of the &s;ide, which, when the legs are extended laterally, is as it were pulled out, forming a broad lateral wing or fin, and when the legs are made u&s;e of in walking, this &s;kin, by its ela&s;ticity, is drawn clo&s;e to the &s;ide of the animal, and forms a kind of ridge, on which the hair has a peculiar appearance. In this re&s;pect it is very &s;imilar to the flying &s;quirrel of America.</P>
<P>It has five toes on each fore foot, with &s;harp nails. The hind foot has al&s;o five toes, but differs con&s;iderably from the fore foot; one of the toes may be called a thumb, having a broad nail, &s;omething like that of the Monkey or Opo&s;&s;um: what an&s;wers to the fore and middle toes are united in one common covering, and appear like one toe

<P>Its hair is very thick and long, making a very fine fur, e&s;pecially on the back. It is of a dark brown grey on the upper part, a light white grey on the lower &s;ide of what may be termed the wing, and white on the under &s;urface, from the neck to the parts adjacent to the anus.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Governor <HI>PHILLIP</HI> to the Right Honourable Lord <HI>SYDNEY,</HI> dated Sydney Cove, 12th February <HI>1790.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Supply left Norfolk I&s;land, the people were all very healthy, and they had vegetables in the greate&s;t abund|ance; they get fi&s;h when the weather permits to the boat to go without the reef, and, at times, in &s;uch quantities, that fi&s;h is &s;erved to the people in lieu of &s;alt provi&s;ions. They make their lines from the flax plant, but unfortunately we have not any per&s;on who under&s;tands how to dre&s;s it.</P>
<P>Half a pod of cotton being found on the i&s;land, &s;uppo&s;ed to be brought there by a bird, and a cocoa-nut which was perfectly &s;ound, and appeared to have been but a &s;hort time in the water,
<PB N="2" REF="421">being thrown upon the beach, have given &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e that both the&s;e articles will be found in &s;ome i&s;land at no great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Lord Howe I&s;land has been examined, but no fre&s;h water, or good anchorage, being found, it can be of no other advantage to this Settlement, than occa&s;ionally &s;upplying a few turtle.</P>
<P>I had the honour of informing your Lord&s;hip, that a Settle|ment was intended to be made at a place I named Ro&s;e Hill.&mdash;At the head of this harbour there is a creek, which at half flood has water for large boats to go three miles up; and one mile higher the water is fre&s;h, and the &s;oil good. A very in|du&s;trious man, who I brought from England, is employed there at pre&s;ent, and has under his direction one hundred convicts, who are employed in clearing and cultivating the ground. A barn, granary, and other nece&s;&s;ary buildings, are erected, and twenty-&s;even acres in corn promi&s;e a good crop. The &s;oil is good, and the country for twenty miles to the we&s;tward, which is as far as I have examined, lays well for cultivation; but even there the labour of clearing the ground is very great; and I have &s;een none that can be cultivated without cutting down the timber, except &s;ome few particular &s;pots, which from their &s;ituation (laying at a di&s;tance from either of the harbours) can be of no advantage to us at pre&s;ent; and I pre&s;ume the meadows mentioned in Captain Cook's voyage were &s;een from the high grounds about Botany Bay, and from whence they appear well
<PB N="3" REF="422">to the eye, but when examined are found to be mar&s;hes, the draining of which would be a work of time, and not to be at|tempted by the fir&s;t &s;ettlers.</P>
<P>The captain's guard, which until lately did duty at Ro&s;e Hill, is now reduced to a lieutenant and twelve privates, and intended merely as a guard to the &s;tore which contains the provi&s;ions, and which is in the redoubt, for I am now &s;en&s;ible there is nothing to be apprehended from the natives; and the little attention which had been de&s;ired of the officers, more than what was immediately garri&s;on duty, when at Ro&s;e Hill, is now no longer required.</P>
<P>At Sydney Cove all the officers are in good huts, and the men in barracks; and although many unfore&s;een difficulties have been met with, I believe there is not an individual, from the governor to the private &s;oldier, who&s;e &s;ituation is not more eligible at this time than he had any rea&s;on to expect it could be in the cour&s;e of the three years &s;tation. And it is the &s;ame with the convicts; and tho&s;e who have been any ways indu&s;|trious have vegetables in plenty. The buildings now carrying on are of brick and &s;tone. The hou&s;e intended for my&s;elf was to con&s;i&s;t of only three rooms, but having a good foundation has been enlarged, contains &s;ix rooms, and is &s;o well built that I pre&s;ume it will &s;tand for a great number of years.</P>
<P>The &s;tores have been lately over-run with rats, and they are equally numerous in the gardens, where they do con&s;iderable
<PB N="4" REF="423">damage; and as the lo&s;s in the &s;tores could only be known by removing all the provi&s;ions, that was ordered to be done, and many ca&s;ks of flour and rice were found to be damaged or to|tally de&s;troyed. The lo&s;s in tho&s;e two articles by the rats, &s;ince landing, has been more than twelve thou&s;and weight.</P>
<P>Vegetables and provi&s;ions having been frequently &s;tolen in the night from convicts and others, twelve convicts were cho&s;en as a night watch; and they have actually an&s;wered the end pro|po&s;ed, no robbery having been committed for &s;everal months, and the convicts in general have lately behaved better than I ever expected. Only two convicts have &s;uffered death in the la&s;t year.&mdash;Four were executed the fir&s;t year.</P>
<P>As near two years have now pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince we fir&s;t landed in this country, &s;ome judgment may be formed of the climate, and I believe a finer or more healthy climate is not to be found in any part of the world. Of one thou&s;and and thirty people who were landed, many of whom were worn out by old age, the &s;curvy, and various di&s;orders, only &s;eventy-two have died in one and-twenty months; and by the Surgeon's returns it appears that twenty-&s;ix of tho&s;e died from di&s;orders of long &s;tanding, and which it is more than probable would have carried them off much &s;ooner in England. Fifty-nine children have been born in the above time.</P>
<P>In December the corn at Ro&s;e Hill was got in: the corn was exceeding good; about two hundred bu&s;hels of wheat, and
<PB N="5" REF="424">&s;ixty of barley, with a &s;mall quantity of flax, Indian corn, and oats, all which is pre&s;erved for &s;eed.&mdash;Here I beg leave to ob|&s;erve to your Lord&s;hip, that if &s;ettlers are &s;ent out, and the convicts divided among&s;t them, this Settlement will very &s;hortly maintain it&s;elf, but without which this country cannot be cul|tivated to any advantage: at pre&s;ent I have only one per&s;on (who has about a hundred convicts under his direction) who is employed in cultivating the ground for the public benefit, and he has returned the quantity of corn above mentioned into the public &s;tore; the officers have not rai&s;ed &s;ufficient to &s;upport the little &s;tock they have. Some ground I have had in culti|vation will return about forty bu&s;hels of wheat into &s;tore; &s;o that the produce of the labour of the convicts employed in cul|tivation has been very &s;hort of what might have been expected, and which I take the liberty of pointing out to your Lord&s;hip in this place, to &s;hew as fully as po&s;&s;ible the &s;tate of this colony, and the nece&s;&s;ity of the convicts being employed by tho&s;e who have an intere&s;t in their labour. The giving convicts to the officers has been hitherto nece&s;&s;ary, but it is attended with many inconveniences, for which the advantages ari&s;ing to the officers do not make amends. It will not, therefore, be con|tinued after this detachment is relieved, unle&s;s particularly directed. The numbers employed in cultivation will of cour&s;e be encrea&s;ed, as the nece&s;&s;ary buildings are fini&s;hed, but which will be a work of time; for the numbers in this Settlement
<PB N="6" REF="425">who do nothing towards their own &s;upport exceed tho&s;e em|ployed for the public.</P>
<P>In November the Supply &s;ailed for Norfolk I&s;land with &s;ome convicts, and returned after being ab&s;ent &s;ix weeks. All the people in that i&s;land were well, and their crops, after all they had &s;uffered from rats, birds, and a worm which had done them con&s;iderable damage, &s;o good that they had grain &s;uffi|cient for &s;ix months bread for every one upon the i&s;land, re|&s;erving &s;ufficient for their next year's crops.</P>
<P>Early in January 1790 the Supply again &s;ailed for Norfolk I&s;land with more convicts; and in her pa&s;&s;age left a &s;mall party on Lord Howe I&s;land, to turn turtle; but in fifteen days only three were taken; &s;o that no great advantages will at pre|&s;ent accrue from thence. The i&s;land has fre&s;h water, but no good anchoring ground.</P>
<P>Since the deaths mentioned in a former part of this letter, one woman has &s;uffered for a robbery, five children have died, and twenty-eight children have been born; making in all &s;eventy-&s;even deaths, and eighty-&s;even births.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Governor <HI>PHILLIP</HI> to the Right Honourable Lord <HI>SYDNEY;</HI> dated Sydney Cove, 13th of February 1790.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to get a knowledge of the country round this Settle|ment, frequent excur&s;ions have been made &s;ince the &s;hips &s;ailed in November 1788; &s;oon after which I went to Botany Bay,
<PB N="7" REF="426">and the five days &s;pent in that harbour confirmed me in the opi|nion I had fir&s;t formed of it&mdash;that it afforded no eligible &s;itua|tion for fixing the Settlement, and was a bad harbour, not affording good &s;ecurity for &s;hips again&s;t the ea&s;terly winds, which frequently blow very hard in the winter, and which has been further proved by Captain Hunter, and the fir&s;t lieute|nant of the Sirius, when there to &s;urvey the Bay.</P>
<P>After having been &s;everal times with the boats to Broken Bay, in order to examine the different branches in that harbour, a river was found; but the want of provi&s;ions obliged us to return without being able to trace it to its &s;ource, which has &s;ince been done; and in the &s;ixteen days we were then out, all tho&s;e branches which had any depth of water were traced as far as the boats could proceed.</P>
<P>The breadth of this river (named the Hawke&s;bury) is from 300 to 800 feet; and it appears from the &s;oundings we had to be navigable for the large&s;t merchant &s;hips to the foot of Richmond Hill; but as the water near the head of the river &s;ometimes ri&s;es after very heavy rains thirty feet above its com|mon level, it would not be &s;afe for &s;hips to go &s;o far up; but fifteen or twenty miles below Richmond Hill they would lay in fre&s;h water, and perfectly &s;afe. I &s;peak of Richmond Hill as being the head of the river, it there growing very &s;hallow, and dividing into two branches.</P>
<P>The high rocky country which forms Broken Bay is lo&s;t as
<PB N="8" REF="427">you proceed up the Hawke&s;bury, and the banks of the river are there covered with timber, the &s;oil a rich light mould; and, judging from the little we &s;aw of the country, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it good land to a very con&s;iderable extent; the other branches of fre&s;h water are &s;hoal, but probably run many miles further into the country than we could trace them with our boats. On the&s;e rivers we &s;aw great numbers of wild ducks, and &s;ome black &s;wans; and on the banks of the Hawke&s;bury &s;everal decoys made by the natives for to catch the quail.</P>
<P>Richmond Hill (near the foot of which a fall of water pre|vented our proceeding further with the boats) is the &s;outhern extremity of a range of hills, which, running to the northward, mo&s;t probably join the mountains which lay nearly parallel to the coa&s;t, from fifty to &s;ixty miles inland. The &s;oil of Rich|mond Hill is good, and it lays well for cultivation. Our pro|&s;pect from the hill was very exten&s;ive to the &s;outhward and ea&s;tward; the country appearing, from the height at which we were, to be a level covered with timber: there is a flat of &s;ix or &s;even miles between Richmond Hill and a break in the mountains, which &s;eparates Land&s;downe and Carmarthen Hills; and in this flat, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Hawke&s;bury continues its cour&s;e, but which could not be &s;een for the timber, that, with very few exceptions, covers the country wherever the &s;oil is good.</P>
<P>The great advantages of &s;o noble a river, when a Settlement can be made on its banks, will be obvious to your Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="428">The Settlement made at Port Jack&s;on, near the head of the harbour (Ro&s;e Hill) very fully an&s;wers my expectations&mdash;the &s;oil is exceeding good, lays well for cultivation, and is well watered. Six miles to the &s;outhward there is a &s;mall fre&s;h water river, and twenty miles to the we&s;tward there is a more con&s;iderable river, the &s;ource of which I &s;uppo&s;e to be at the foot of the mountains. The banks of this river, which mo&s;t probably empties it&s;elf into the Hawke&s;bury, are high; the &s;oil a good light mould, and covered with trees; the wood of &s;ome of tho&s;e trees is very light; they are about the &s;ize of large walnut trees, which they re&s;emble; they &s;hed their leaves, and bear a &s;mall fruit, which is &s;aid to be very whole&s;ome. This river likewi&s;e frequently ri&s;es thirty feet above its com|mon level; it is, as far as I have &s;een it, from 300 to 400 feet in breadth, I named it the Nepean, and its &s;ource will be traced in the cour&s;e of the winter, and from its banks I hope to reach the mountains, which has been attempted by a party who cro&s;&s;ed the river, but after the fir&s;t day's journey they met with &s;uch a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of deep ravines, the &s;ides of which were frequently inacce&s;&s;ible, that they returned, not having been able to proceed above fifteen miles in five days; when they turned back they &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves to be twelve mile sfrom the foot of the mountains.</P>
<P>As the land for &s;everal miles to the &s;outhward, and twenty miles to the we&s;tward of Ro&s;e Hill, that is, to the banks of
<PB N="10" REF="429">the Nepean, is as fine land for tillage as mo&s;t in England (&s;ome few particular &s;pots excepted, the &s;oil of which is poor, but bears a very &s;mall proportion to the good land), I propo&s;e that tract of land for tho&s;e &s;ettlers which may be &s;ent out; and though they will be placed at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, for the conveniency of water (from one to three or four miles), they will have nothing to apprehend from the natives, who avoid tho&s;e parts we mo&s;t frequent, and always retire at the &s;ight of two or three people who are armed.</P>
<P>As the labour of clearing the ground of timber will be great, I think each &s;ettler &s;hould not have le&s;s than twenty men on his farm, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be from five hundred to one thou&s;and acres: It will be nece&s;&s;ary to give that number of convicts to tho&s;e &s;ettlers who come out, and to &s;upport them for two years from the public &s;tores; in that time, if they are any ways indu&s;trious, they will be in a &s;ituation to &s;upport them&s;elves, and I do not think they will be able to do it in le&s;s time. At the expiration of the two years they may return half the convicts they have been allowed, and would want no fur|ther a&s;&s;i&s;tance from government.</P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary to grant lands to officers and &s;oldiers, who becoming &s;ettlers will of cour&s;e be entitled to every in|dulgence; but few of the officers now here have reaped any great advantage from being allowed convicts; and it is attended with unavoidable inconvenience from tho&s;e convicts being left
<PB N="11" REF="430">&s;o much to them&s;elves, and from their mixing with the &s;oldiers. It may be found more to the advantage of the Crown and the officers likewi&s;e, if officers on duty in this Settlement were allowed a certain quantity of grain to &s;upport their live &s;tock, until they have a market to go to, and I make no doubt but that in the third year from the time &s;ettlers arrive there will be a market well &s;upplied with grain, poultry, hogs, and goats, of all which there has been a great increa&s;e, but killed, from wanting corn to &s;upport them; and the natives &s;o frequently &s;etting fire to the country, which they do to catch the opo&s;&s;um, flying &s;quirrel, and other animals, has prevented &s;wine from being turned out, as was intended.</P>
<P>If this plan, of di&s;tributing among&s;t the &s;ettlers tho&s;e con|victs who are not immediately nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the public works, is approved of, and which I propo&s;e, as appear|ing to me the mo&s;t likely to render this Settlement independent for the nece&s;&s;aries of life in the &s;horte&s;t time po&s;&s;ible, there are many regulations which will of cour&s;e take place.</P>

<HEAD>Extracts of a Letter from Governor <HI>PHILLIP</HI> to Lord <HI>SYDNEY;</HI> dated Government Hou&s;e, Sydney Cove, April 11th, <HI>1790.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE quantity of flour brought from the Cape of Good Hope by the Sirius was le&s;s than I expected&mdash;Four months flour only for the Settlement, and a year's provi&s;ions for the &s;hip's company; and it was nece&s;&s;ary to give the &s;hip a very con|&s;iderable
<PB N="12" REF="431">repair before &s;he could be &s;ent to &s;ea again, which was not completed before the middle of January, when I had rea&s;on to expect &s;hips from England in the cour&s;e of a few weeks. The &s;ending to the i&s;lands would have an&s;wered as far as procuring live &s;tock to breed from, but which was not im|mediately wanted; and what the Sirius could have brought for the con&s;umption of &s;uch a number of people, would have been but a very &s;mall relief. Howe I&s;land has been tried &s;everal times, and only a few turtle procured.</P>
<P>The goodne&s;s of the &s;oil on Norfolk I&s;land, and the indu&s;try of tho&s;e employed there, rendered that i&s;land a re&s;ource, and the only one that offered, when, from the time which had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince my letters might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been received in England, there was rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome accident had happened to the &s;tore &s;hips &s;ent out.</P>
<P>I therefore ordered two companies of marines to be ready to embark with a number of convicts, by the 5th of March, if no &s;hip arrived before that time; and a proportion of what pro|vi&s;ions and &s;tores remained in this Settlement being put on board the Sirius and Supply, &s;ixty-five officers and men, with five women and children from the detachment and civil depart|ment, one hundred and &s;ixteen male and &s;ixty-&s;even female convicts, with twenty-&s;even children, embarked and &s;ailed the 6th of March.</P>
<P>The advantage I expected by &s;ending away &s;uch a number
<PB N="13" REF="432">of people was from the little garden ground they would leave, and which would al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who remained, and the fi&s;h which might be caught in the winter would go the further; at the &s;ame time tho&s;e &s;ent to Norfold I&s;land would have re&s;ources in the great abundance of vegetables rai&s;ed there, and in fi&s;h and birds, which this Settlement could not afford them; and it was my intention to have &s;ent more convicts to that i&s;land, if there had not been this nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>The provi&s;ions &s;ent, with what was on the I&s;land, and the wheat and Indian corn rai&s;ed there, more than would be nece&s;|&s;ary for &s;eed, was calculated to la&s;t full as long as the provi&s;ions in this place; and at Norfolk I&s;land, from the richne&s;s of the &s;oil, a man may &s;upport him&s;elf with little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the &s;tore after the timber is cleared away.</P>
<P>As I wi&s;hed to &s;end an officer to England who could give &s;uch information as cannot be conveyed by letters, and the detachment was now divided, I replaced the officer who was &s;uperintendant and commandant at Norfolk I&s;land, by Major Ro&s;s; the officer I have recalled having been two years on the i&s;land, is very capable of pointing out the advantages which may be expected from it, and I think it promi&s;es to an&s;wer very fully the end propo&s;ed by making the Settlement; it will be a place of &s;ecurity for the convicts, where they will &s;oon &s;upport them&s;elves, and where they may be advantageou&s;ly em|ployed in cultivating the flax plant.</P>

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF NORFOLK ISLAND.</HEAD>
<P>NORFOLK I&s;land is &s;ituated in the latitude 29&deg; 00&prime;, and in the longitude of 168&deg; 00&prime; ea&s;t: its form is nearly an oblong, and contains from twelve to fourteen thou&s;and acres.</P>
<P>The face of the country is hilly, and &s;ome of the vallies are tolerably large for the &s;ize of the i&s;land; many of the hills are very &s;teep, and &s;ome few &s;o very perpendicular that they can|not be cultivated; but where &s;uch &s;ituations are, they will do very well for fuel; on the tops of the hill are &s;ome exten&s;ive flats.</P>
<P>Mount Pitt is the only remarkable high hill in the i&s;land, and is about one hundred and fifty fathoms high. The clifts which &s;urround the i&s;land are about forty fathoms high, and perpendicular; the ba&s;is of the i&s;land is a hard firm clay. The whole i&s;land is covered with a thick wood, choaked up with underwood.</P>
<P>The i&s;land is well &s;upplied with many &s;treams of very fine
<PB N="16" REF="435">water; many of which are &s;ufficiently large to turn any number of mills. The&s;e &s;prings are full of very large eels.</P>
<P>From the coa&s;t to the &s;ummit of Mount Pitt is a continua|tion of the riche&s;t and deepe&s;t &s;oil in the world, which varies from a rich black mould to a fat red earth; we have dug down forty feet, and found the &s;ame &s;oil; the air is very whole&s;ome, and the climate may be called a very healthy one; there has been no &s;ickne&s;s &s;ince I fir&s;t landed on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>There are five kinds of trees on the i&s;land, which are good timber, viz. the pine, live oak, a yellow wood, a hard black wood, and a wood not unlike the Engli&s;h beech. The pine trees are of a great &s;ize, many of which are from 180 to 220 feet in height, and from &s;ix to nine feet in diameter. Tho&s;e trees, which are from 100 to 180 feet in height, are in general &s;ound; from the root to the lower branches there is from 80 to 90 feet of &s;ound timber, the re&s;t is too hard and knotty for u&s;e; it &s;ometimes happens, that after cutting off twenty feet from the butt, it becomes rotten or &s;hakey, for which rea&s;on no dependance can be put in it for large ma&s;ts or yards. The timber of the pine is very u&s;eful in buildings, and is plentiful along the coa&s;t; its di&s;per&s;ed &s;ituation in the interior parts of the i&s;land is well calculated for erecting &s;uch buildings as may be nece&s;&s;ary. From what I have &s;een of this wood, I think it is very durable. Two boats have been built of it, and have an&s;wered the purpo&s;e fully.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="436">The live oak, yellow wood, black wood, and beech, are all of a clo&s;e grain, and are a durable wood.</P>
<P>The flax plant of New Zealand grows &s;pontaneou&s;ly in many parts of the i&s;land, but mo&s;tly abounds on the &s;ea coa&s;t, where there is a very great quantity of it; the leaves of which the flax is made is, when full grown, &s;ix feet long and &s;ix inches wide; each plant contains &s;even of tho&s;e leaves; a &s;trong woody &s;talk ri&s;es from the centre, which bears the flowers; it &s;eeds annually, and the old leaves are forced out by young ones every year. Every method has been tried to work it, but I much fear that until a native of New Zealand can be carried to Norfolk I&s;land, that the method of dre&s;&s;ing that valuable commodity will not be known; and, could that be obtained, I have no doubt but Norfolk I&s;land would very &s;oon cloath the inhabitants of New South Wales.</P>
<P>There are a great quantity of pigeons, parrots, hawks, and other &s;maller birds, which are now in a wild &s;tate.</P>
<P>The ground is much infe&s;ted with different kinds of the grub worm, which are very de&s;tructive to the growth of vegetables; they are mo&s;tly trouble&s;ome about the &s;pring. It is to be hoped that when more ground is cleared away, that this evil will cea&s;e.</P>
<P>There is no quadrupede on the i&s;land except the rat, which is much &s;maller than the Norway rat: the&s;e vermin were very trouble&s;ome when fir&s;t we landed, but at pre&s;ent there are but very few.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="437">The coa&s;ts of the i&s;land abound with very fine fi&s;h. No op|portunities were ever lo&s;t of &s;ending the boat out, which enabled us to make a &s;aving of two pounds of meat, each man, a week.</P>
<P>The coa&s;ts of the i&s;land are in general &s;teep too, and except|ing at Sydney, An&s;on, Ball, and Ca&s;cade Bays, they are inac|ce&s;&s;ible, being &s;urrounded by &s;teep perpendicular clifts ri&s;ing from the &s;ea. Some rocks are &s;cattered about clo&s;e to the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Sydney Bay, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land, is where the Settlement is made: landing at this place entirely depends on the wind and the weather; I have &s;een as good landing as in the Thames, for a fortnight or three weeks together, and I have often &s;een it impracticable to land for ten or twelve days &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively, but it is much oftener good landing than bad.</P>
<P>An&s;on Bay is a &s;mall bay with a &s;andy beach, where landing is in general good, with an off-&s;hore wind and moderate weather; but as the interior parts of the i&s;land are &s;o difficult of acce&s;s from thence, no &s;hip's boats have ever landed there.</P>
<P>Ball Bay is on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, the beach is a large loo&s;e &s;tone: when landing is bad in Sydney Bay, it is very good here, as it al&s;o is in Ca&s;cade Bay, on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>During the winter months, viz. from April to Augu&s;t, the general winds are the &s;outh and &s;outh-we&s;t, with heavy gales at times. In the &s;ummer the &s;outh-ea&s;t wind blows almo&s;t con&s;tant.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="438">The &s;pring is vi&s;ible in Augu&s;t, but the native trees, and many plants in the i&s;land, are in a con&s;tant &s;tate of flowering: the &s;ummer is warm, and &s;ometimes the droughts are very great; all the grain and European plants &s;eeded in December; from February to Augu&s;t may be called the rainy rea&s;on, not that I think there is any &s;tated times for rains in the&s;e months, as it is &s;ometimes very fine weather for a fortnight together, but when the rain does fall, it is in torrents; I do not remember above three claps of thunder during the time I was on the i&s;land. The winter is very plea&s;ant, and it never freezes.</P>
<P>The proper time for &s;owing wheat and barley is from May to Augu&s;t, and is got in in December; that which has been &s;owed has produced twenty-five fold, and I think the increa&s;e may be greater. Two bu&s;hels of barley &s;owed in 1789 produced twenty-four bu&s;hels of a &s;ound full grain.</P>
<P>The Indian corn produces well, and is, in my opinion, the be&s;t grain to cultivate in any quantity, on account of the little trouble attending its growth, and manufacturing for eating.</P>
<P>The Rio Janeiro &s;ugar cane grows very well, and is thriving.</P>
<P>Vines and oranges are very thriving; of the former there will be a great quantity in a few years.</P>
<P>Potatoes thrive remarkably well, and yield a very great in|crea&s;e; I think two crops a year of that article may be got with great ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="439">Every kind of garden vegetable thrives well, and comes to great perfection.</P>
<P>The quantity of ground cleared, and in cultivation, belong|ing to the public, was, on the 13th March 1790, from twenty-eight to thirty-two acres, and about eighteen cleared by free people and convicts for their gardens,</P>
