<HEAD>THE DECLINE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING, they &s;ay, is more cer|tain than death, and nothing more un|certain than the time of dying; yet we can always fix a period beyond which man cannot live, and within &s;ome mo|ments of which he will die. We are enabled to do this, not by any &s;pirit of prophe&s;y, or fore&s;ight into the event, but by ob&s;ervation of what has happened in all ca&s;es of human or animal exi&s;tence. If then any other &s;ubject, &s;uch, for in|&s;tance, as a &s;y&s;tem of finance, exhibits in its progre&s;s a &s;eries of &s;ymptoms in|dicating decay, its final di&s;&s;olution is certain, and the period of it can be calculated from the &s;ymptoms it exhibits.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have hitherto written on the Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem of finance (the &s;un|ding
<PB N="6" REF="3">&s;y&s;tem) have been uniformly im|pre&s;&s;ed with the idea of its downfal hap|pening <HI>&s;ome time or other.</HI> They took, however, no data for that opinion, but expre&s;&s;ed it predictively, or merely as opinion, from a conviction that the per|petual duration of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem was a natural impo&s;&s;ibility. It is in this man|ner that Dr. Price has &s;poken of it; and Smith, in his <HI>Wealth of Nations,</HI> has &s;po|ken in the &s;ame manner; that is, mere|ly as opinion without data. "The pro|gre&s;s," &s;ays Smith, <Q>of the enor|mous debts which at pre&s;ent oppre&s;s, and will in the long-run <HI>mo&s;t probably ruin,</HI> all the great nations of Europe, (he &s;hould have &s;aid <HI>governments</HI>) has been pretty uniform.</Q> But this ge|neral manner of &s;peaking, though it might make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion, carried with it no conviction.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to predict any thing; but I will &s;hew from data already known, from &s;ymptoms and facts which the Engli&s;h funding &s;y&s;tem has already exhibited publicly, that it will not con|tinue to the end of Mr. Pitt's life, &s;uppo|&s;ing
<PB N="7" REF="4">him to live the u&s;ual life of a man. How much &s;ooner it may fall, I leave to others to predict.</P>
<P>Let financiers diver&s;ify &s;y&s;tems of cre|dit as they will, it is neverthele&s;s true, that every &s;y&s;tem of credit is a &s;y&s;tem of paper money. Two experiments have already been had upon paper money; the one in America, the other in France. In both tho&s;e ca&s;es the whole capital was emitted, and that whole capital, which in America was called continental money, and in France a&s;&s;ignats, appeared in cir|culation; the con&s;equence of which was, that the quantity became &s;o enormous, and &s;o di&s;proportioned to the quantity of population, and to the quantity of objects upon which it could be employ|ed, that the market, if I may &s;o ex|pre&s;s it, was glutted with it, and the value of it fell. Between five and &s;ix years de|termined the fate of tho&s;e experiments. The &s;ame fate would have happened to gold and &s;ilver, could gold and &s;ilver have been i&s;&s;ued in the &s;ame abundant manner as paper had been, and confined in the country as paper money always is, by hav|ing
<PB N="8" REF="5">no circulation out of it; or to &s;peak on a larger &s;cale, the &s;ame thing would hap|pen in the world, could the world be glut|ted with gold and &s;ilver, as America and France has been with paper.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem differs from that of America and France in this one par|ticular, that its capital is kept out of &s;ight; that is, it does not appear in cir|culation. Were the whole capital of the national debt, which at the time I write this is almo&s;t four hundred mil|lion pounds &s;terling, to be emitted in a&s;|&s;ignats or bills, and that whole quantity put into circulation, as was done in Ame|rica and in France, tho&s;e Engli&s;h a&s;&s;ign|ats, or bills, would &s;ink in value as tho&s;e of America and France have done; and that in a greater degree, becau&s;e the quantity of them would be more di&s;pro|portioned to the quantity of population in England, than was the ca&s;e in either of the other two countries. A nominal pound &s;terling in &s;uch bills would not be worth one penny.</P>
<P>But though the Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem, by thus keeping the capital out of &s;ight, is
<PB N="9" REF="6">pre&s;erved from ha&s;ty de&s;truction, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the ca&s;e of America and France, it ne|verthele&s;s approaches the &s;ame fate, and will arrive at it with the &s;ame certainty, though by a &s;lower progre&s;s. The dif|ference is altogether in the degree of &s;peed by which the two &s;y&s;tems ap|proach their fate, which, to &s;peak in round numbers, is as twenty is to one; that is, the Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem, that of fund|ing the capital in&s;tead of i&s;&s;uing it, con|tained within it&s;elf a capacity of endur|ing twenty times longer than the &s;y&s;tem adopted by America and France; and at the end of that time it would arrive at the &s;ame common grave, the Potter's field, of paper money.</P>
<P>The datum, I take for this proportion of twenty to one, is the difference be|tween a capital and the intere&s;t at five per cent. Twenty times the intere&s;t is equal to the capital. The accumulation of paper money in England is in propor|tion to the accumulation of the intere&s;t upon every new loan; and therefore the progre&s;s to di&s;&s;olution is twenty times &s;lower than if the capital were to be emitted and put into circulation imme|diately.
<PB N="10" REF="7">Every twenty years in the Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem is equal to one year in the French and American &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h funding &s;y&s;tem began one hundred years ago; in which time there has been &s;ix wars, including the war that ended in 1697.</P>
<P N="1">1. The war that ended, as I have ju&s;t &s;aid, in 1697.</P>
<P N="2">2. The war that began in 1702.</P>
<P N="3">3. The war that began in 1739.</P>
<P N="4">4. The war that began in 1756.</P>
<P N="5">5. The American war, that began in 1775.</P>
<P N="6">6. The pre&s;ent war, that began in 1793.</P>
<P>The national debt, at the conclu&s;ion of the war, which ended in 1697, was twenty-one millions and an half. (See Smith's Wealth of Nations, chapter on Public Debts.) We now &s;ee it ap|proaching fa&s;t to four hundred millions. If between tho&s;e two extremes of twen|ty-one millions and four hundred millions, embracing the &s;everal expences of all the including wars, there exi&s;ts &s;ome common ratio that will a&s;certain arith|metically the amount of the debt at the
<PB N="11" REF="8">end of each war, as certainly as the fact is now known to be, that ratio will in like manner determine what the amount of the debt will be in all future wars, and will a&s;certain the period within which the funding &s;y&s;tem will expire in a bankruptcy of the government; for the ratio I allude to, is the ratio which the nature of the thing has e&s;tabli&s;hed for it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Hitherto no idea has been entertain|ed that any &s;uch ratio exi&s;ted, or could exi&s;t, that could determine a problem of this kind, that is, that could a&s;cer|tain, without having any knowledge of the fact, what the expence of any for|mer war had been, or what the expence of any future war would be; but it is, neverthele&s;s, true that &s;uch a ratio does exi&s;t, as I &s;hall &s;hew, and al&s;o the mode of applying it.</P>
<P>The ratio I allude to is not in Arith|metical progre&s;&s;ion, like the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; nor yet in geometrical progre&s;&s;ion, like the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256:
<PB N="12" REF="9">but is in the &s;eries of one half upon, each preceding number; like the num|bers 8, 12, 18, 27, 40, 60, 90, 135.</P>
<P>Any per&s;on can perceive that the &s;e|cond number, 12, is produced by the preceding number, 8, and half 8; and that the third number, 18, is in like man|ner produced by the preceding number, 12, and half 12; and &s;o on for the re&s;t. They can al&s;o &s;ee how rapidly the &s;ums increa&s;e as the ratio proceeds. The dif|ference between the two fir&s;t numbers is but four; but the difference between the two la&s;t is forty-five: and from thence they may &s;ee with what immen&s;e rapidity the national debt has increa&s;ed, and will continue to increa&s;e, till it exceeds the ordinary powers of calculation, and lo&s;es it&s;elf in cyphers.</P>
<P>I come now to apply the ratio as a rule to determine all the ca&s;es.</P>
<P>I begin with the war that ended in 1697, which was the war in which the funding &s;y&s;tem began. The expence of that war was twenty-one millions and an half. In order to a&s;certain the expence of the next
<PB N="13" REF="10">war, I add to twenty-one millions and an half, the half thereof (ten millions and three quarters), which makes thirty-two millions and a quarter, added to the former debt of twenty-one millions and an half, carries the national debt to fifty-three mil|lions and three quarters. Smith, in his chapter on Public Debts, &s;ays, Thenation|al debt was at this time fifty-three millions.</P>
<P>I proceed to a&s;certain the expence of the next war, that of 1739, by adding, as in the former ca&s;e, one half to the ex|pence of the preceeding war. The ex|pence of the preceding war was thirty-two millions and a quarter: for the &s;ake of even numbers, &s;ay thirty-two millions, the half of which (16) makes forty-eight millions for the expence of that war.</P>
<P>I proceed to a&s;certain the expence of the war of 1756, by adding, according to the ratio, one half to the expence of the preceding war. The expence of the pre|ceding war was taken at 48 millions, the half of which (24) makes 72 millions for the expence of that war. Smith (chap|ter on public debts) &s;ays, the expence of
<PB N="14" REF="11">the war of 1756 was 72 millions and a quarter.</P>
<P>I proceed to a&s;certain the expence of the American war, of 1775, by adding, as in the former ca&s;es, one half to the ex|pence of the preceding war. The ex|pence of the preceding war was 72 millions, the half of which (36) makes 108 milli|ons for the expence of that war. In the la&s;t edition of Smith (chapter on Public Debts) he &s;ays, the expence of the Ame|rican war was <HI>more than an hundred mil|lions.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to a&s;certain the expence of the pre&s;ent war, &s;uppo&s;ing it to conti|nue as long as former wars have done, and the funding &s;y&s;tem not to break up before that period. The expence of the preced|ing war was 108 millions, he half of which (54) makes 162 millions for the ex|pence of the pre&s;ent war. It gives &s;ymp|toms of going beyond this &s;um, &s;uppo&s;ing the funding &s;y&s;tem not to break up; for the loans of the la&s;t year and of the pre|&s;ent year, are twenty-two millions each, which exceeds the ratio compared with the loans of the preceding war. It will
<PB N="15" REF="12">not be from the inability of procuring loans that the &s;y&s;tem will break up. On the contrary, it is the facility with which loans can be procured, that ha&s;tens that event. The loans are altogether paper tran&s;actions, and it is the exce&s;s of them that brings on, with the accelerating &s;peed, that progre&s;&s;ive depreciation of funded paper money that will di&s;&s;olve the funding &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>I proceed to a&s;certain the expence of fu|ture wars, and I do this merely to &s;hew the impo&s;&s;ibility of the continuance of the fund|ing &s;y&s;tem, and the certainty of its di&s;&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>The expence of the next war after the pre&s;ent war, according to the ratio that has a&s;certained the preceding ca&s;es will be
<LIST>
<ITEM>&mdash;243 millions</ITEM>
<ITEM>Expence of the &s;econd war 364 millions</ITEM>
<ITEM>&mdash; third war &mdash; 546 millions</ITEM>
<ITEM>&mdash; fourth war &mdash; 819 millions</ITEM>
<ITEM>&mdash; fifth war &mdash; 1228 millions</ITEM>
<ITEM>&mdash; 3200 millions</ITEM>
</LIST> which, at only 4 per cent, will require taxes to the nominal amount of one hun|dred
<PB N="16" REF="13">and twenty-eight millions to pay the annual intere&s;t, be&s;ides the intere&s;t of the pre&s;ent debt, and the expences of govern|ment, which are not included on this ac|count. Is there a man &s;o mad, &s;o &s;tupid, as to &s;uppo&s;e this &s;y&s;tem can continue?</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t conceived the idea of &s;eek|ing for &s;ome common ratio that &s;hould ap|ply as a rule of mea&s;urement to all the ca|&s;es of the funding &s;y&s;tem, &s;o far as to a&s;cer|tain the &s;everal &s;tages of its approach to di&s;&s;olution, I had no expectation that any ratio could be found that would apply with &s;o much exactne&s;s as this does. I was led to the idea merely by ob&s;erving that the funding &s;y&s;tem was a thing in con|tinual progre&s;&s;ion, and that whatever was in a &s;tate of progre&s;&s;ion might be &s;uppo|&s;ed to admit of, at lea&s;t, &s;ome general ratio of mea&s;urement, that would apply without any very great variation. But who could have &s;uppo&s;ed that falling &s;y&s;|tems, or falling opinions, admitted of a ratio apparently as true as the de&s;cent of falling bodies? I have not made the ra|tio, any more than Newton made the ra|tio of gravitation. I have only di&s;covered
<PB N="17" REF="14">it, and explained the mode of applying it. To &s;hew at one view the rapid progre&s;|&s;ion of the funding &s;y&s;tem to de&s;truction, and to expo&s;e the folly of tho&s;e who blind|ly believe in its continuance, or who art|fully endeavour to impo&s;e that belief upon others, I exhibit in the annexed table, the expence of each of the &s;ix wars &s;ince the funding &s;y&s;tem began, as a&s;certained by the ratio, and the expence of &s;ix wars yet to come, a&s;certained by the ratio.</P>

A circum&s;tance that &s;erves to prove the truth of the ratio more fully than if the interruption had not taken place. The war of 1739 was languid: the efforts were below the value of mo|ney at that time: for the ratio is the mea&s;ure of the depreciation of money in con&s;equence of the fund|ding &s;y&s;tem; or what comes to the &s;ame end, it is the mea&s;ure of the increa&s;e of paper.

<P><PB N="18" REF="15">Tho&s;e who are acquainted with the power with which even a &s;mall ratio act|ing in progre&s;&s;ion, multiplies in a long &s;eries, will &s;ee nothing to wonder at in this table. Tho&s;e who are not acquaint|ed with that &s;ubject, and not knowing what el&s;e to &s;ay may be inclined to deny it. But it is not their opinion one way, nor mine the other, that can influence the event. The table exhibits the natural march of the &s;unding &s;y&s;tem, to its irre|deemable di&s;&s;olution. Suppo&s;ing the pre|&s;ent government of England to continue, and to go on as it has gone on &s;ince the funding &s;y&s;tem began, I would not give twenty &s;hillings for one hundred pounds in the funds to be paid twenty years hence. I do not &s;peak this predictively; I produce the data upon which that belief is founded: and which data it is every
<PB N="19" REF="16">body's intere&s;t to know, who have any thing to do with the funds, or who are going to bequeath property to their de|&s;cendants to be paid at a future day.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be a&s;ked, that as go|vernments or mini&s;ters proceeded by no ratio in making loans or incurring debts, and as nobody intended any ratio, or thought of any, how does it happen that there is one? I an&s;wer, that the ratio is founded in nece&s;&s;ity; and I now go to ex|plain what that nece&s;&s;ity is.</P>
<P>It will always happen, that the price of labour, or of the produce of labour, be that produce what it may, will be in pro|portion to the quantity of money in a country, admitting things to take their natural cour&s;e. Before the invention of the funding &s;y&s;tem, there was no other money than gold and &s;ilver; and as na|ture gives out tho&s;e metals with a &s;paring hand, and in regular annual quantities from the mines, the &s;everal prices of things were proportioned to the quantity of money at that time, and &s;o nearly &s;ta|tionary as to vary but little in any fifty or &s;ixty years of that period.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="17">When the funding &s;y&s;tem began, a &s;ub|&s;titute for gold and &s;ilver began al&s;o. That &s;ub&s;titute was paper; and the quan|tity of it increa&s;ed as the quantity of inte|re&s;t increa&s;ed upon accumulated loans. This appearance of a new and additional &s;pecies of money in the nation &s;oon began to break the relative value which money and the things it will purcha&s;e bore to each other before. Every thing ro&s;e in price, but the ri&s;e at fir&s;t was little and &s;low, like the difference in units between the two fir&s;t numbers, 8 and 12, compared with the two la&s;t numbers, 90, and 135, in the table. It was however &s;ufficient to make it&s;elf con&s;iderably felt in a large tran&s;action. When therefore government, by engaging in a new war, required a new loan, it was obliged to make a higher loan than the former loan to balance the increa&s;ed price to which things had ri&s;en; and as that new loan increa&s;ed the quanti|ty of paper in proportion to the new quan|tity of intere&s;t, it carried the price of things &s;till higher than before.</P>
<P>The next loan was again higher, to balance that further increa&s;ed price; and
<PB N="21" REF="18">all this in the &s;ame manner, though not in the &s;ame degree, that every new emi&s;&s;ion of continental money in America, or of a&s;&s;ignats in France, were greater than the preceding emi&s;&s;ion, to make head again&s;t the advance of prices, till the com|bat could be contained no longer. Herein is founded the nece&s;&s;ity of which I have ju&s;t &s;poken. That nece&s;&s;ity proceeds with accelerating velocity, and the ratio I have laid down is the mea&s;ure of that acceler|ation; or to &s;peak the technical language of the &s;ubject, it is the mea&s;ure of the in|crea&s;ing depreciation of funded paper money, and of bank-notes continues to multiply. What el&s;e but this can account for the difference between one war's co&s;t|ing 21 millions, and another war's co&s;ting 160 millions?</P>
<P>The difference cannot be accounted for on the &s;core of extraordinary efforts, or extraordinary atchievements. The war that co&s;t 21 millions, was the war of the confederates, hi&s;torically called the grand alliance, con&s;i&s;ting of England, Au&s;tria, and Holland, in the time of William the Third, again&s;t Louis the Fourteenth, and
<PB N="22" REF="19">in which the confederates were victorious. The pre&s;ent is a war of much greater confederacy&mdash;a confederacy of England, Au&s;tria, Pru&s;&s;ia, the German Empire, Spain, Holland, Naples, and Sardinia, eight powers again&s;t the French Republic &s;ingly, and the Republic has beaten the whole confederacy. But to return to my &s;ubject&mdash;</P>
<P>It is &s;aid in England, that the value of paper keeps equal with the value of gold and &s;ilver. But the ca&s;e is not rightly &s;tated; for the fact is, that the paper has <HI>pulled down</HI> the value of gold and &s;ilver to a level with it&s;elf. Gold and &s;ilver will not purcha&s;e &s;o much of any purcha&s;able article at this day as if no paper had ap|peared, nor &s;o much as it will in any country in Europe where there is no pa|per. How long this hanging together of money and paper will continue makes a new ca&s;e; becau&s;e it daily expo&s;es the &s;y&s;tem to &s;udden death, independent of the natural death it would otherwi&s;e &s;uffer.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider the funding &s;y&s;tem as being now advanced into the la&s;t twenty years
<PB N="23" REF="20">of its exi&s;tence. The &s;ingle circum&s;tance were there no other, that a war &s;hould co&s;t <HI>nominally</HI> one hundred and &s;ixty mil|lions which when the &s;y&s;tem began co&s;t but twenty-one millions, or that the loan for one year only, (including the loan to the Emperor) &s;hould now be <HI>nominally</HI> greater than the whole expence of that war, &s;hews the &s;tate of depriciation to which the funding &s;y&s;tem has arrived. Its depreciation is in the proportion of eight for one, compared with the value of its money when the &s;y&s;tem began; which is the &s;tate the French a&s;&s;ignats &s;tood in a year ago (March, 1795), com|pared with gold and &s;ilver. It is there|fore that I &s;ay, that the Engli&s;h funding &s;y&s;tem, has entered into the la&s;t twenty years of its exi&s;tence. Comparing each twenty years of the Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem with every &s;ingle year of the American and French &s;y&s;tems, as before &s;tated.</P>
<P>Again, &s;uppo&s;ing the pre&s;ent war to clo&s;e as former wars have done, and with|out producing either revolution or reform in England, another war at lea&s;t mu&s;t be looked for in the &s;pace of the twenty
<PB N="24" REF="21">years I allude to; for it has never yet happened that twenty years have pa&s;&s;ed off without a war, and that more e&s;peci|ally &s;ince the Engli&s;h government has dabbled in German politics, and &s;hewn a di&s;po&s;ition to in&s;ult the world, and the world of commerce, with her navy. That next war will carry the national debt to very nearly &s;even hundred millions, the intere&s;t of which, at four per cent. will be twenty-eight millions, be&s;ides the taxes for the (then) expences of govern|ment, which will increa&s;e in the &s;ame pro|portion, and which will carry the taxes to at lea&s;t 40 millions: and if another war only begins, it will quickly carry them to above fifty; for it is in the la&s;t twenty years of the funding &s;y&s;tem, as in the la&s;t year of the American and French &s;y&s;tems without funding, that all the great &s;hocks begin to operate.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t mentioned that paper, in England, has <HI>pulled down</HI> the value of gold and &s;ilver to a level with it&s;elf; and that this <HI>pulling down</HI> of gold and &s;ilver money has created the appearance of paper mo|ney's keeping up. The &s;ame thing, and
<PB N="25" REF="22">the &s;ame mi&s;take, took place in America and in France, and continued for a con&s;i|derable time after the commencment of their &s;y&s;tem of paper; and the actual depreciation of money was hidden under that mi&s;take.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid in America, at that time, that every thing was becoming <HI>dear;</HI> but gold and &s;ilver could then buy tho&s;e dear articles no cheaper than paper could; and therefore it was not called depreciation. The idea of <HI>dearne&s;s</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf for the idea of depreciation. The &s;ame was the ca&s;e in France. Though every thing ro&s;e in price &s;oon after a&s;&s;ignats appeared, yet tho&s;e dear articles could be purcha&s;ed no cheaper with gold and &s;ilver than with paper, and it was only &s;aid that things were <HI>dear.</HI> The &s;ame is &s;till the language in England. They call it <HI>dearne&s;s.</HI> but they will &s;oon find that it is an actual de|preciation, and that this depreciation is the effect of the funding &s;y&s;tem; which, by crowding &s;uch a continually increa&s;ing ma&s;s of paper into circulation, carries down the value of gold and &s;ilver with it.
<PB N="26" REF="23">But gold and &s;ilver will, in the long run, revolt again&s;t depreciation, and &s;eparate from the value of paper; for the progre&s;s of all &s;uch &s;y&s;tems appears to be, that the paper will take the command in the beginning, and gold and &s;ilver in the end.</P>
<P>But this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the command of gold and &s;ilver over paper, makes a cri&s;is far more eventful to the funding &s;y&s;tem than to any other &s;y&s;tem upon which pa|per can be i&s;&s;ued; for, &s;trictly &s;peaking, it is not a cri&s;is of danger, but a &s;ymptom of death. It is a death &s;troke to the fun|ding &s;y&s;tem. It is a revolution in the whole of its affairs.</P>
<P>If paper be i&s;&s;ued without being fund|ed upon intere&s;t, emi&s;&s;ions of it cannot be continued after the value of it &s;epa|rates from gold and &s;ilver, as we have &s;een in the two ca&s;es of America and France. But the funding &s;y&s;tem re&s;ts altogether upon the value of paper being equal to gold and &s;ilver; which will be as long as the paper can continue carrying down the value of gold and &s;ilver to the &s;ame level to which it&s;elf de&s;cends, and no longer. But even in this &s;tate, that of
<PB N="27" REF="24">de&s;cending equally together, the mini&s;ter, whoever he may be, will find him&s;elf be|&s;et with accumulating difficulties; becau&s;e the loans and taxes voted for the &s;ervice of each en&s;uing year will wither in his hands before the year expires, or before they can be applied. This will force him to have recour&s;e to emi&s;&s;ions of what are called exchequer and navy bills, which, by &s;till increa&s;ing the ma&s;s of paper in circulation, will drive on the depreciation &s;till more rapidly.</P>
<P>It ought to be known that taxes in En|gland are not paid in gold and &s;ilver, but in paper (bank notes). Every per&s;on who pays any con&s;iderable quantity of taxes, &s;uch as mal&s;ters, brewers, di&s;tillers (I appeal for the truth of it to any of the collectors of exci&s;e in England, or to Mr. Whitbread), knows this to be the ca&s;e. There is not gold and &s;ilver enough in the nation to pay the taxes in coin, as I &s;hall &s;hew; and con&s;equently there is not mo|ney enough in the bank to pay the notes. The intere&s;t of the national funded debt is paid at the bank in the &s;ame kind of pa|per in which the taxes are collected.
<PB N="28" REF="25">When people find, as they will find a re|&s;ervedne&s;s among each other in giving gold and &s;ilver for bank notes, or the lea&s;t preference for the former over the latter, they will go for payment to the bank, where they have a right to go. They will do this as a mea&s;ure of prudence, each one for him&s;elf, and the truth or delu&s;ion of the funding &s;y&s;tem will then be proved.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid in the foregoing paragraph, that there is not gold and &s;ilver enough in the nation to pay the taxes in coin, and con&s;equently, that there cannot be enough in the bank to pay the notes. As I do not choo&s;e to re&s;t any thing upon a&s;&s;erti|on, I appeal for the truth of this to the publications of Mr. Eden (now called Lord Aukland), and George Chalmers, Secretary to the Board of Trade and Plantation, of which Jenkin&s;on (now called Lord Hawke&s;bury) is pre&s;ident. [The&s;e &s;ort of folks change their names &s;o often, that it is as difficult to know them as it is to know a thief.] Chalmers gives the quantity of gold and &s;ilver coin from the returns of coinage at the mint; and, af|ter
<PB N="29" REF="26">deducting for the light gold recoined, &s;ays, that the amount of gold and &s;ilver coin is <HI>about twenty millions.</HI> He had bet|ter not have proved this, e&s;pecially if he had reflected, that, <HI>public credit is &s;u&s;pici|on a&s;leep.</HI> The quantity is much too little.</P>
<P>Of this twenty millions (which is not a fourth part of the quantity of gold and &s;ilver there is in France, as is &s;hewn in Mr. Neckar's Treati&s;e on the Admini&s;tra|tion of the Finances) three millions at lea&s;t mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in Ireland &s;ome in Scotland, and in the We&s;t-Indies, Newfoundland, &amp;c. The quantity there|fore in England cannot be more than &s;ixteen millions, which is four millions le&s;s than the amount of the taxes. But ad|mitting there to be &s;ixteen millions, not more than a fourth part thereof (four millions) can be in London, when it is con&s;idered that every city, town, village, and farm-hou&s;e in the nation mu&s;t have a part of it, and that all the great manu|factories, which mo&s;t require ca&s;h, are out of London. Of this four millions in London, every banker, merchant, trades|man,
<PB N="30" REF="27">in &s;hort, every individual mu&s;t have &s;ome. He mu&s;t be a poor &s;hop-keeper indeed, who has not a few guineas in his till. The quantity of ca&s;h therefore in the bank can never, on the evidence of circum&s;tances, be &s;o much as two milli|ons; mo&s;t probably not more than one million; and on this &s;lender twig, always liable to be broken, hangs the whole fun|ding &s;y&s;tem of four hundred millions, be|&s;ides many millions in bank notes. The &s;um in the bank is not &s;ufficient to pay one fourth of only one years intere&s;t of the national debt, were the creditors to demand payment in ca&s;h, or to demand ca&s;h for the bank notes in which the in|tere&s;t is paid. A circum&s;tance always li|able to happen.</P>
<P>One of the amu&s;ements that has kept up the farce of the funding &s;y&s;tem, is, that the intere&s;t is regularly paid. But as the intere&s;t is always paid in bank notes, and as bank notes can always be coined for the purpo&s;e, this mode of payment proves nothing. The point of proof is, can the bank give ca&s;h for the bank notes on which the intere&s;t is paid? If it can
<PB N="31" REF="28">not, and it is evident it cannot, &s;ome mil|millions of bank notes mu&s;t go without payment, and tho&s;e holders of bank notes who apply la&s;t will be wor&s;t off. When the pre&s;ent quantity of ca&s;h in the bank be paid away, it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee how any new quantity is to arrive. None will arrive from taxes, for the taxes will all be paid in bank notes; and &s;hould the go|vernment refu&s;e bank notes in payment of taxes, the credit of bank notes will be gone at once. No ca&s;h will arrive from the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of di&s;counting merchants bills, for every merchant will pay off tho&s;e bills in bank notes, and not in ca&s;h. There is therefore no means left for the bank to obtain a new &s;upply of ca&s;h after the pre|&s;ent quantity be paid away. But, be&s;ides the impo&s;&s;ibility of paying the intere&s;t of the funded debt in ca&s;h, there are many thou&s;and per&s;ons in London and in the country, who are holders of bank notes that came into their hands in the fair way of trade, and who are not &s;tock holders in the &s;unds; and as &s;uch per&s;ons have had no hand in increa&s;ing the demand upon the bank, as tho&s;e have had, who, for their
<PB N="32" REF="29">own private intere&s;t, like Boyd and others, are contracting, or pretending to contract, for new loans, they will conceive they have a ju&s;t right their bank notes &s;hould be paid fir&s;t. Boyd has been very &s;ly in France, in changing his paper into ca&s;h. He will be ju&s;t as &s;ly in doing the &s;ame thing in London; for he has learned to calculate: and then it is probable he will &s;et off for America.</P>
<P>A &s;toppage of payment at the bank is not a new thing. Smith, in his Wealth of Nations, book 2, chap. 2, &s;ays, that in the year 1696, exchequer bills fell forty, fifty, and &s;ixty per cent. bank notes twen|ty per cent. and the bank &s;topt payment.&mdash; That which happened in 1696, may hap|pen again in 1796. The period in which it happened was the la&s;t year of the war of king William. It nece&s;&s;arily put a &s;top to the further emi&s;&s;ion of exchequer and navy bills, and to the rai&s;ing of new loans; and the peace which took place the next year was probably hurried on by this circum&s;tance, and &s;aved the bank from bankruptcy. Smith, in &s;peaking of the circum&s;tances of the bank, upon another
<PB N="33" REF="30">occa&s;ion, &s;ays, (book 2, chap. 2,)&mdash;<Q>This great company has been reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of paying in &s;ixpences.</Q> When a bank adopts the expedient of pay|ing in &s;ixpences, it is a confe&s;&s;ion of in|&s;olvency.</P>
<P>It is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that every ca&s;e of failure in finances, &s;ince the &s;y&s;tem of paper began, has produced a revolution in governments, either total or partial. A failure in the finances of France pro|duced the French revolution. A failure in the finance of a&s;&s;ignats, broke up the revolutionary government, and produced the pre&s;ent French Con&s;titution. A fai|lure in the finances of the old Congre&s;s of America, and the embarra&s;&s;ments it brought upon commerce, broke up the &s;y&s;tem of the old confederation, and produced the pre&s;ent federal con&s;titution. If then we admit of rea&s;oning by compari|&s;on of cau&s;es and events a failure in the Engli&s;h finances will produce &s;ome change in the government of that country.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Pitt's project of paying off the national debt by applying a million a year for that purpo&s;e, while he continues
<PB N="34" REF="31">adding more than twenty millions a year to it, it is like &s;etting a man with a wood|en leg to run after a hare. The longer he runs the farther he is off.</P>
<P>When I &s;aid that the funding &s;y&s;tem had entered the la&s;t twenty years of its exi&s;t|ence, I certainly did not mean that it would continue twenty years and then ex|pire as a lea&s;e would do. I meant to de&s;|cribe that age of decripitude in which death is every day expected, and life can|not continue long. But the death of cre|dit, or that &s;tate that is called bankruptcy, is not always marked by tho&s;e progre&s;&s;ive &s;tages of vi&s;ible decline, that mark the decline of natural life. In the progre&s;&s;ion of nautral life, age annot counterfeit youth nor conceal the departure of juvenile abili|ties. But it is otherwi&s;e with re&s;pect to the death of credit; for though all the approaches to bankruptcy may actually exi&s;t in circum&s;tances, they admit of being concealed by appearances. Nothing is more common than to &s;ee the bankrupt of to-day a man in credit but the day before; yet no &s;ooner is the real &s;tate of his affairs known than every body can &s;ee he had been in&s;olvent long before.
<PB N="35" REF="32">In London the greate&s;t theatre of bankrupt|cy in Europe, this part of the &s;ubject will be well and feelingly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt continually talks of credit, and of the national re&s;ources. The&s;e are two of the feigned appearances by which the approaches to bankruptcy are concealed. That which he calls credit may exi&s;t as I have ju&s;t &s;hewn, in a &s;tate of in&s;olvency and is always what I have before de&s;cribed it to be, <HI>&s;u&s;picion a&s;leep.</HI></P>
<P>As to national re&s;ources, Mr. Pitt, like all the Engli&s;h financiers that pre|ceded him &s;ince the funding &s;y&s;tem be|gan, has uniformly mi&s;taken the nature of a re&s;ource: that is, they have mi&s;ta|ken it con&s;i&s;tently with the delu&s;ion of the funding &s;y&s;tem; but time is explain|ing the delu&s;ion. That which he calls, and which they called, a re&s;ource, is not a re&s;ource, but it is the <HI>anticipation</HI> of a re&s;ource. They have anticipated what <HI>would have been</HI> a re&s;ource in another ge|neration, had not the u&s;e of it been &s;o anticipated. The funding &s;y&s;tem is a &s;y&s;tem of anticipation. Tho&s;e who e&s;|tabli&s;hed it an hundred years ago, antici|pated the re&s;ources of tho&s;e who were to
<PB N="36" REF="33">live an hundred years after; for the peo|ple of the pre&s;ent day have to pay the intere&s;t of the debts contracted at that time, and of all debts contracted &s;ince. But it is the la&s;t feather that breaks the hor&s;e's back. Had the &s;y&s;tem began an hundred years before, the amount of tax|es at this time to pay the annual intere&s;t at four per cent. (could we &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of in&s;anity could have continu|ed) would be two hundred and twenty millions annually; for the capital of the debt would be 54886 millions, according to the ratio that a&s;certains the expence of the wars for the hundred years that are pa&s;t. But long before it could have reached this period, the value of bank notes, from the immen&s;e quantity of them, (for it is in paper only that &s;uch a nomi|nal revenue could be collected) would have been as low or lower than continental paper money has been in America, or a&s;&s;ignats in France; and as to the idea of exchanging them for gold and &s;ilver, it is too ab&s;urd to be contradicted.</P>
<P>Do we not &s;ee that nature in all her o|perations, di&s;owns the vi&s;ionary ba&s;is
<PB N="37" REF="34">upon which the funding &s;y&s;tem is built? She acts always by renewed &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, and never by accumulating additions per|petually progre&s;&s;ing. Animals and ve|getables, men and trees, have exi&s;ted ever &s;ince the world began; but that ex|i&s;tence has been carried on by &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of generations, and not by continuing the &s;ame men and the &s;ame trees in exi&s;tence that exi&s;ted fir&s;t; and to make room for the new &s;he removes the old. Every natural idiot can &s;ee this. It is the &s;tock-jobbing idiot only that mi&s;takes. He has conceived that art can do what nature cannot. He is teaching her a new &s;y&s;tem &mdash;that there is not occa&s;ion for men to die&mdash;That the &s;cheme of creation can be carried on upon the plan of the funding &s;y&s;tem&mdash;That it can proceed by continual additions of new beings, like new loans, and all live together in eter|nal youth. Go, count the graves, thou idiot, and learn the folly of thy arith|metic.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the&s;e things, there is &s;ome|thing vi&s;ibly farcical in the whole opera|tion
<PB N="38" REF="35">of loaning. It is &s;carcely more than four years ago that &s;uch a rot of bankrupt|cy &s;pread it&s;elf over London, that the whole commercial fabric tottered; trade and credit were at a &s;tand; and &s;uch was the &s;tate of things, that to prevent, or &s;u&s;|pend, a general bankruptcy, the govern|ment lent the merchants &s;ix millions in <HI>go|vernment</HI> paper, and now the merchants lend the government twenty two millions in <HI>their</HI> paper; and two parties, Boyd and Morgan, men but little known, con|tend who &s;hall be the lenders. What a farce is this! It reduces the operation of loaning to accommodation paper, in which the competitors contend, not who &s;hall lend but who &s;hall &s;ign, becau&s;e there is &s;omething to be got for &s;igning.</P>
<P>Every Engli&s;h &s;tock-jobber and mini&s;|ter boa&s;ts of the credit of England. Its credit, &s;ay they, is greater than that of any country in Europe. There is a good rea&s;on for this; for there is not another country in Europe that could be made the dupe of &s;uch a delu&s;ion. The Engli&s;h funding &s;y&s;tem will remain a monument of wonder, not &s;o much on account of the
<PB N="39" REF="36">extent to which it has been carried, as of the folly of believing in it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who had formerly predicted that the funding &s;y&s;tem would break up when the debt &s;hould amount to one hundred or one hundred and fifty millions, erred only in not di&s;tingui&s;hing between in&s;olvency and actual bankruptcy; for the in&s;olvency commenced as &s;oon as the government be|came unable to pay the intere&s;t in ca&s;h, or to give ca&s;h for the bank notes in which the intere&s;t was paid, whether that ina|bility was known or not, or whether it was &s;u&s;pected or not. In&s;olvency always takes place before bankruptcy; for bank|ruptcy is nothing more than the publica|tion of that in&s;olvency. In the affairs of an individual, it often happens that in&s;ol|vency exi&s;ts &s;everal years before bankrupt|cy, and that the in&s;olvency is concealed and carried on till the individual is not able to pay one &s;hilling in the pound. A government can ward off bankruptcy long|er than an individual; but in&s;olvency will inevitably produce bankruptcy, whether in an individual or in a government. If then the quantity of bank notes payable
<PB N="40" REF="37">on demand, which the bank has i&s;&s;ued, are greater than the bank can pay off, the bank is in&s;olvent; and when that in&s;olven|cy be declared, it is bankruptcy.</P>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Among the delu&s;ions that have been impo&s;ed upon the nation by mini&s;ters, to give a fal&s;e colouring to its affairs, and by none more than by Mr. Pitt, is a motley, amphibious charactered thing called the <HI>balance of trade.</HI> This balance of trade, as it is cal|led, is taken from the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books, in which entries are made of all cargoes exported, and al&s;o of all cargoes imported, in each year; and when the value of the exports, according to the price &s;et upon them by the exporter or by the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, is greater than the value of the imports, e&s;timated in the &s;ame manner they &s;ay, the balance of trade, is &s;o much in their favour.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books prove regularly enough that &s;o many cargoes have been exported, and &s;o many imported; but this is all that they prove, or were intended to prove. They have nothing to do with the balance of profit or lo&s;s; and it is ignorance to appeal to them upon that account; for the ca&s;e is, that the greater the lo&s;s is in any one year, the higher will this thing called the balance of trade ap|pear to be, according to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books. For example, nearly the whole of the Mediterranean convoy was taken by the French this year; con&s;e|quently tho&s;e cargoes will not appear as imports on the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books, and therefore the balance of trade, by which they mean the profits of it, will appear to be &s;o much the greater as the lo&s;s amounts to; and, on the other hand, had the lo&s;s not happen|ed, the profits would have appeared to have been &s;o much the le&s;s. All the lo&s;&s;es happening at &s;ea to returning cargoes, by accidents, by the elements, or by capture, make the balance appear the higher on the &s;ide of the exports; and were they all lo&s;t at &s;ea, it would appear to be all profit on the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books. Al&s;o every cargo of exports that is lo&s;t that occa&s;ions another to be &s;ent, adds in like manner, to the &s;ide of the exports, and appears as profit. This year the balance of trade will appear high, becau&s;e the lo&s;&s;es have been great by capture and by &s;torms. The ignorance of the Briti&s;h Par|liament, in li&s;tening to this hackneyed impo&s;ition of mini&s;ters about the balance of trade, is a&s;toni&s;hing. It &s;hews how little they know of national affairs; and Mr. Grey may as well talk Greek to them, as make motions about the &s;tate of the nation. They under&s;tand fox-hunting and the game-laws.</P></NOTE>
<P><PB N="41" REF="38">
I come now to &s;hew the &s;everal ways by which bank notes get into circulation. I &s;hall afterwards offer an e&s;timate on the total quantity or amount of bank notes ex|i&s;ting at this moment.</P>
<P>The bank acts in three capacities. As a bank of di&s;count; as a bank of depo&s;it; and as banker for the government.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t as bank of di&s;count. The bank di&s;counts merchants bills of exchange for two months. When a merchant has a bill that will become due at the end of two months, and wants payment before that time, that bank advances that payment to
<PB N="42" REF="39">him, deducting therefrom at the rate of five per cent. per ann. The bill of ex|change remains at the bank as a pledge or pawn, and at the end of two months it mu&s;t be redeemed. This tran&s;action is done altogether in paper; for the profits of the bank, as a bank of di&s;count, ari&s;e entirely from its making u&s;e of paper as money. The bank gives bank notes to the merchant in di&s;counting the bill of ex|change, and the redeemer of the bill pays bank notes to the bank in redeeming it. It very &s;eldom happens that the real mo|ney pa&s;&s;es between them.</P>
<P>If the profits of a bank be, for example, two hundred thou&s;and pounds a year (a great &s;um to be made merely by exchang|ing one &s;ort of paper for another, and which &s;hews al&s;o that the merchants of that place are pre&s;&s;ed for money for pay|ments, in&s;tead of having money to &s;pare to lend to government,) it proves that the bank di&s;counts to the amount annually, or 666,666l. every two months; and there never remains in the bank more than two months pledge, of the value of 666,666l. at any one time, the amount
<PB N="43" REF="40">of bank notes in circulation at any one time &s;hould not be more than to that a|mount. This is &s;ufficient to &s;hew that the pre&s;ent immen&s;e quantity of bank notes, which are di&s;tributed through e|very city, town, village, and farm-hou&s;e in England, cannot be accounted for on the &s;core of di&s;counting.</P>
<P>Secondly, as a bank of depo&s;it. To depo&s;it money at the bank means to lodge it there for the &s;ake of convenience, and to be drawn out at any moment the de|po&s;iter plea&s;es, or to be paid away to his order. When the bu&s;ine&s;s of di&s;count|ing is great, that of depo&s;iting is nece&s;&s;a|rily &s;mall. No man depo&s;its and applies for di&s;count at the &s;ame time; for it would be like paying intere&s;t for lending money, in&s;tead of for borrowing it. The depo&s;its that are now made at the bank are almo&s;t entirely in bank notes, and con&s;equently they add nothing to the abi|lity off the bank to pay of the bank notes that may be pre&s;ented for payment; and be&s;ides this, the depo&s;its are no more the property of the bank than the ca&s;h or bank notes in a merchant's counting hou&s;e
<PB N="44" REF="41">are the property of his book-keeper. No great increa&s;e therefore of bank notes, be|yond what the di&s;counting bu&s;ine&s;s admits, can be accounted for on the &s;core of de|po&s;its.</P>
<P>Thirdly. The bank acts as banker for the government. This is the connection that threatens ruin to every public bank. It is through this connection that the cre|dit of a bank is forced far beyond what it ought to be, and &s;till further beyond its ability to pay. It is through this connec|tion that &s;uch an immen&s;e redundant quantity of bank notes have gotten into circulation; and which, in&s;tead of being i&s;&s;ued becau&s;e there was property in the bank, have been i&s;&s;ued becau&s;e there was none.</P>
<P>When the trea&s;ury is empty, which happens in almo&s;t every year of every war, its coffers at the bank are empty al&s;o. It is in this condition of emptine&s;s that the mini&s;ter has recour&s;e to emi&s;&s;ions of wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t are called exchequer and navy bills, which continually generates a new increa&s;e of bank notes, and which are &s;ported upon the public without there
<PB N="45" REF="42">being property in the bank to pay them. &mdash;The&s;e exchequer and navy bills (being, as I have &s;aid, emitted becau&s;e the trea|&s;ury and its coffers at the bank are empty and cannot pay the demands that come in) are no other than an acknowledgement that the bearer is entitled to receive &s;o much money. They may be compared to the &s;ettlement of an account, in which the debtor acknowledges the balance he owes, and for which he gives a note of hand, or to a note of hand given to rai&s;e money upon it.</P>
<P>Sometimes the bank di&s;counts tho&s;e bills as it would di&s;count merchants bills of exchange; &s;ometimes it purcha&s;es them of the holders at the current price; and &s;ometimes it agrees with the mini&s;ter to pay an intere&s;t upon them to the holders, and keep them in circulation. In every one of tho&s;e ca&s;es an additional quantity of bank notes get into circulation, and are &s;ported, as I have &s;aid, upon the public, without there being property in the bank, as banker for the government, to pay them: and be&s;ides this, the bank has now no money of its own; for the money
<PB N="46" REF="43">that was originally &s;ub&s;cribed to begin the the credit of the bank which at its fir&s;t e&s;|tabli&s;hment, has been lent to government, and wa&s;ted long ago.</P>
<P><Q>The bank (&s;ays Smith, book 2, chap. 2,) acts not only as an ordinary bank, but as a great engine of &s;tate; it receives and pays the greater part of the annuities which are due to the cre|ditors of the public.</Q> (It is worth ob&s;erving, that the public, or the nation, is always put for the government in &s;peak|ing of debts.) It circulates (&s;ays Smith) <Q>exchequer bills, and it advances to go|vernment the annual amount of the land and malt taxes which are frequent|ly not paid till &s;everal years afterwards.</Q> (This advancement is al&s;o done in bank|notes, for which there is not property in the bank.) <Q>In tho&s;e different operati|ons, (&s;ays Smith) <HI>its duty to the public</HI> may &s;ometimes have obliged it, without any fault of its directors, <HI>to over &s;tock the circulation with paper money,</HI></Q> bank notes. How its <HI>duty to the public</HI> can induce it to <HI>over &s;tock that public</HI> with pro|mi&s;&s;ory bank notes which it <HI>cannot pay,</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="44">and thereby expo&s;e the individuals of that public to ruin, is too paradoxical to be explained; for it is on the credit which individuals <HI>give to the bank,</HI> by receiving and circulating its notes, and not upon its <HI>own</HI> credit or its <HI>own</HI> property, for it has none that the bank &s;ports. If how|ever it be the duty of the bank to expo&s;e the public to this hazard, it is at lea&s;t equally the duty of the individuals of that public to get their money and take care of them&s;elves; and leave it to place|men, pen&s;ioners, government contractors, Reeves's a&s;&s;ociation, and the members of both hou&s;es of Parliment, who have vot|ed away the money at the nod of the mini&s;ter, to continue the credit if they can, and for which their e&s;tates individual|ly and collectively ought to an&s;wer as far as they will go.</P>
<P>There has always exi&s;ted, and &s;till ex|i&s;ts, a my&s;terious, &s;u&s;picious connection, between the mini&s;ter and the directors of the bank, and which explains it&s;elf no otherways than by a continual increa&s;e of bank notes. Without, therefore, enter|ing into any further details of the various
<PB N="48" REF="45">contrivances by which bank notes are i&s;|&s;ued, and thrown upon the public, I pro|ceed, as I before mentioned, to offer an e&s;timate on the total quantity of bank notes in circulation.</P>
<P>However di&s;po&s;ed governments may be to wring money by taxes from the peo|ple, there is a limit to the practice e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the nature of things. That limit is the proportion between the quan|tity of money in a nation, be that quan|tity what it may, and the greate&s;t quan|tity of taxes that can be rai&s;ed upon it. People have other u&s;es for money be&s;ides paying taxes; and it is only a proportion|al part of that money they can &s;pare for taxes, as it is only a proportional part they can &s;pare for hou&s;e-rent, for clothing, or for any other particular u&s;e. The&s;e proportions find out and e&s;tabli&s;h them|&s;elves; and that with &s;uch exactne&s;s, that if any one part exceeds its propor|tion, all the other parts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eel it.</P>
<P>Before the invention of paper money (bank notes), there was no other money in the nation than gold and &s;ilver, and the greate&s;t quantity of money that ever
<PB N="49" REF="46">was rai&s;ed in taxes during that period, never exceeded a fourth part of the quan|tity of money in the nation. It was high taxing when it came to this point. The taxes in the time of William the Third never reached to four millions before the invention of paper, and the quantity of money in the nation at that time was e&s;timated to be about &s;ixteen millions. The &s;ame proportions e&s;tabli&s;hed them|&s;elves in France. There was no paper money in France before the pre&s;ent revo|lution, and the taxes were collected in gold and &s;ilver money. The highe&s;t quan|tity of taxes never exceeded twenty-two millions &s;terling; and the quantity of gold and &s;ilver money in the nation at the &s;ame time, as &s;tated by Mr. Neckar, from returns of coinage at the mints, in his Treati&s;e on the Admini&s;tration of the Fi|nances, was about ninety millions &s;terling. To go beyond this limit of a fourth part, in England, they were obliged to intro|duce paper money; and the attempt to go beyond it in France, where paper could not be introduced broke up the
<PB N="50" REF="47">government, This proportion therefore of a fourth part, is the limit which the nature of the thing e&s;tabli&s;hes for it&s;elf, be the quantity of money in a nation more or le&s;s.</P>
<P>The amount of taxes in England at this time is full twenty millions: and there|fore the quantity of gold and &s;ilver, and of bank notes, taken together, amounts to eighty millions. The quantity of gold and &s;ilver, as &s;tated by Lord Hawkesbu|ry's &s;ecretary, (George Chalmers), as I have before &s;hewn, is twenty millions; and therefore the total amount of bank notes in circulation, all made payable on demand, is &s;ixty millions. This enormous &s;um will a&s;toni&s;h the mo&s;t &s;tupid &s;tock-jobber, and overpower the credulity of the mo&s;t thoughtle&s;s Engli&s;hman: but were it only a third of that &s;um, the bank cannot pay half a crown in a pound.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething curious in the move|ments of this modern complicated ma|chine, the funding &s;y&s;tem; and it is only now that it is beginning to unfold the full extent of its movements. In the fir&s;t part of its movements it gives great powers
<PB N="51" REF="48">into the hands of government, and in the la&s;t part it takes them completely away.</P>
<P>The funding &s;y&s;tem &s;et out with rai&s;ing revenues under the name of loans, by means of which government became both prodigal and powerful. The loaners a&s;|&s;umed the name of creditors, and though it was &s;oon di&s;covered that loaning was government-jobbing, tho&s;e pretended loaners, or the per&s;ons who purcha&s;ed into the funds afterwards, conceived them&s;elves not only to be creditors, but to be the <HI>only</HI> creditors.</P>
<P>But &s;uch has been the operation of this complicated machine, the funding &s;y&s;tem, that it has produced, unperceived, a &s;e|cond generation of creditors, more nu|merous and far more formidable, and withal more real than the fir&s;t generation; for every holder of a bank note is a cre|ditor, and a real creditor, and the debt due to him is made payable on demand. The debt therefore which the government owes to individuals is compo&s;ed of two parts; the one about four hundred milli|ons bearing intere&s;t, the other about &s;ixty millions payable on demand. The one is
<PB N="52" REF="49">called the funded debt, the other is the debt due in bank notes.</P>
<P>This &s;econd debt (that contained in the bank notes) has, in a great mea&s;ure, been incurred to pay the intere&s;t of the fir&s;t debt; &s;o that in fact little or no real in|tere&s;t has been paid by government. The whole has been delu&s;ion and fraud. Go|vernment fir&s;t contracted a debt in the form of loans with one cla&s;s of people, and then run clande&s;tinely into debt with another cla&s;s, by means of bank notes, to pay the intere&s;t. Government acted of it&s;elf in contracting the fir&s;t debt, and made a machine of the bank to contract the &s;econd.</P>
<P>It is this &s;econd debt that changes the &s;eat of power and the order of things; for it puts it in the power of even a &s;mall part of the holders of bank notes (had they no other motive than di&s;gu&s;t at Pitt and Greenville's &s;edition bills to controul any mea&s;ure of government they found to be injurious to their intere&s;t; and that not by popular meetings, or popular &s;o|cieties, but by the &s;imple and ea&s;y opera|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on of with-holding their credit from
<PB N="53" REF="50">that government; that is, by individually demanding payment at the bank for every bank note that comes into their hands. Why &s;hould Pitt and Greenville expect that the very men whom they in&s;ult and injure &s;hould at the &s;ame time continue to &s;upport the mea&s;ure of Pitt and Green|ville, by giving credit to their promi&s;&s;ory notes of payment? No new emi&s;&s;ions of bank notes could go on while payment was demanding on the old and the ca&s;h in the bank wa&s;ting daily away; nor any new advances be made to government or to the emperor to carry on the war; nor any new emi&s;&s;ion be made of exche|quer bills.</P>
<P><HI>"The bank,"</HI> &s;ays Smith, (book ii. ch. 2.) "is <HI>a great engine of &s;tate.</HI>" And in the &s;ame paragraph he &s;ays, <HI>"The &s;tabili|ty of the bank is equal to that of the Bri|ti&s;h government;"</HI> which is the &s;ame as to &s;ay that the &s;tability of the government is equal to that of the bank, and no more. If then the bank cannot pay, the <HI>arch|trea&s;urer of the holy Roman empire</HI>) S. R. I. A.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part of the in&s;cription on an Engli&s;h guinea.</NOTE>) is a bankrupt. When folly in|vented
<PB N="54" REF="51">vented titles, &s;he did not attend to their application; for ever &s;ince the go|vernment of England has been in the hands of <HI>arch-trea&s;urers,</HI> it has been run|ning into bankrupty; and as to the arch-trea&s;urer <HI>apparent,</HI> he has been a bankrupt long ago. What a mi&s;erable pro&s;pect has England before its eyes!</P>
<P>Before the war of 1755 there were no bank notes lower than twenty pounds. During that war bank notes of fifteen pounds and of ten pounds were coined; and now, &s;ince the commencement of the pre&s;ent war, they are coined as low as five pounds. The&s;e five pound notes will circulate chiefly among little &s;hop-keepers, butchers, bakers, market people, renters of &s;mall hou&s;es, lodgers, &amp;c. All the high departments of commerce, and the affluent &s;tations of life were already <HI>over-&s;tocked,</HI> as Smith expre&s;&s;es it, with the bank notes. No place remained open wherein to croud an additional quantity of bank notes but among the cla&s;s of peo|ple I have ju&s;t mentioned, and the means of doing this could be be&s;t affected by coming five pound notes. This conduct
<PB N="55" REF="52">has the appearance of that of an unprin|cipled in&s;olvent, who, when on the verge of bankruptcy to the amount of many thou|&s;ands, will borrow as low as five pounds of the &s;ervants in his hou&s;e, and break the next day.</P>
<P>But whatever momentary relief or aid the mini&s;ter and his bank might expect from this low contrivance of five pound notes, it will increa&s;e the inability of the bank to pay the higher notes, and ha&s;ten the de&s;truction of all; for even the &s;mall taxes that u&s;ed to be paid in money will now be paid in tho&s;e notes, and the bank will &s;oon find it&s;elf with &s;carcely any other money than what the hair powder guinea tax brings in.</P>
<P>The bank notes make the mo&s;t &s;erious part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of finance; what is called the national funded debt is but a trifle when put in compari&s;on with it; yet the ca&s;e of the bank notes has never been touched upon. But it certainly ought to be known upon what authority, whether that of the mini&s;ter or of the directors, and upon what foundation, &s;uch immen&s;e quantities are i&s;&s;ued. I have &s;tated the
<PB N="56" REF="53">amount of them at &s;ixty millions &s;terling: I have produced data for that e&s;timation; and be&s;ides this, the apparent quantity of them, far beyond that of gold and &s;ilver in the nation, corroborates therewith. But were there but a third part of &s;ixty millions, the bank cannot pay half a crown in the pound; for no new &s;upply of money as before &s;aid, can arrive at the bank, as all the taxes will be paid in paper.</P>
<P>When the funding &s;y&s;tem began, it was not doubted that the loans that had been borrowed would be repaid. Co|vernment not only propagated that be|lief, but it began paying them off. In time this profe&s;&s;ion came to be abandon|ed; and it is not difficult to &s;ee that bank notes will march the &s;ame way; for the amount of them is only another debt un|der another name; and the probability is that Mr. Pitt will at la&s;t propo&s;e funding them. In that ca&s;e bank notes will not be &s;o valuable as French a&s;&s;ignats. The a&s;&s;ignats have a &s;olid property in re&s;erve in the national domains; bank notes have none; and be&s;ides this, the Engli&s;h re|venue mu&s;t then &s;ink down to what the
<PB N="57" REF="54">amount of it was before the funding &s;y&s;|tem began; between three and four mil|lions. One of which the <HI>arch-trea&s;urer</HI> would require for him&s;elf, and the arch|trea&s;urer <HI>apparent</HI> would require three quarters of a million more to pay his debts. <HI>"In France,"</HI> &s;ays Sterne, <Q>they order the&s;e things better.</Q></P>
<P>I have now expo&s;ed the Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem of finance to the eyes of all nations. In doing this, I have done an act of ju&s;tice to tho&s;e numerous citizens of neutral na|tions who have been impo&s;ed upon by that fraudulent &s;y&s;tem, and who have pro|perty at &s;take upon the event.</P>
<P>As an individual citizen of America, and as far as an individual can go, I have revenged (if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion without any immoral meaning) the pirat|ical depredations commited on the Ame|rican commerce by the Engli&s;h govern|ment. I have retaliated for France on the &s;ubject of finance; and I conclude with retorting on Mr. Pitt the expre&s;&s;ion he u&s;ed again&s;t France, and &s;ay, that the Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem of finance <Q>is on the
<PB N="58" REF="55">verge, nay, even in the gulph of bank|ruptcy.</Q></P>
