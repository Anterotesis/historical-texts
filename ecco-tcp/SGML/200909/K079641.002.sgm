<HEAD>SECTION XVI.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING refre&s;hed our&s;elves, and our hor&s;es, after a fatiguing morning, we proceeded along the vale of Buter|mer; and following the cour&s;e of the river, as far as the inequalities of the ground would admit, we &s;oon came to another lake, &s;till more beautiful, than that we had left above. The two lakes bear a great re&s;emblance to each other. Both are oblong: both wind
<PB N="2" REF="4">
round promontories; and both are &s;urrounded by mountains. But the lower lake is near a mile longer, than the upper; the lines it forms are much ea&s;ier; and tho it has le&s;s wood on it's banks, the lo&s;s is compen&s;ated by a richer di&s;play of rocky &s;cenery. The forms of the&s;e rocks are in general, beautiful; mo&s;t of them being broken into grand &s;quare &s;urfaces. This &s;pecies, as we have already ob&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Page, 108,</NOTE>, are in a greater &s;tyle, than the cragg, which is &s;hattered into more diminu|tive parts.</P>
<P>With this rocky &s;cenery much hilly ground is intermixed. Patches of meadow al&s;o, here and there, on the banks of the lake, improve the variety. Nothing is wanting but a little more wood, to make this lake, and the vale in which it lies, a very inchanting &s;cene; or rather a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of inchanting &s;cenes: for the hills and ri&s;ing grounds, into which it every where &s;wells, acting in due &s;ubordina|tion to the grand mountains, which inviron the whole vale, break and &s;eparate the area of it into &s;maller parts. Many of the&s;e form
<PB N="3" REF="5">
them&s;elves into little vallies, and other re|ce&s;&s;es, which are very picture&s;que.</P>
<P>Not far from the lake the mountain of Gra&s;mer appears ri&s;ing above all the moun|tains in it's neighbourhood. A lake of this name we had already &s;een in our road between Amble&s;ide, and Ke&s;wick; but there is no connection between the lake, and the moun|tain.</P>
<P>This mountain forms rather a va&s;t ridge, than a pointed &s;ummit: and is connected with two or three other mountains of inferior dignity: it&s;elf is &s;aid to be equal to Skiddaw; which is the common gage of altitude through the whole country; and therefore may be &s;uppo&s;ed the highe&s;t. No mountain a&s;pires to be higher than Skiddaw: &s;ome boa&s;t an equal height: but two or three only have real preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>Gra&s;mer, and the mountains in it's neigh|bourhood, form the ea&s;tern boundary of the vale, which we now traver&s;ed; a vale at lea&s;t five miles in length, and one third of that &s;pace in breadth. Our road carried us near
<PB N="4" REF="6">
the village of Brackenthwait, which lies at the bottom of Gra&s;mer.</P>
<P>Here we had an account of an inundation occa&s;ioned by the bur&s;ting of a water-&s;pout. The particulars, which are well authenticated, are curious. But it will be nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to exhibit the geography of the mountain.</P>
<P>In that part, where Gra&s;mer is connected with the other high lands in it's neighbour|hood, three little &s;treams take their origin; of which the Li&s;&s;a is the lea&s;t incon&s;iderable. The cour&s;e of this &s;tream down the moun|tain is very &s;teep, and about a mile in length. It's bed, which is a deep <HI>gully,</HI> and the &s;ides of the mountain all around, are profu&s;ely &s;pread with loo&s;e &s;tones, and gravel. On leaving the mountain, the Li&s;&s;a divides the vale, through which we now pa&s;&s;ed; and, after a cour&s;e of four or five miles, joins the Cocker.</P>
<P>On the 9th of September 1760, about mid|night, the water-&s;pout fell upon Gra&s;mer, nearly, as was conjectured, where the three little &s;treams, ju&s;t mentioned, i&s;&s;ue from their fountains.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">At fir&s;t it &s;wept the whole &s;ide of the moun|tain, and charging it&s;elf with all the rubbi&s;h it found there, made it's way into the vale, following chiefly the direction of the Li&s;&s;a. At the foot of the mountain it was received by a piece of arable ground; on which it's violence fir&s;t broke. Here it tore away trees, &s;oil, and gravel; and laid all bare, many feet in depth, to the naked rock. Over the next ten acres it &s;eems to have made an immen&s;e roll; covering them with &s;o va&s;t a bed of &s;tones; that no human art can ever again re&s;tore the &s;oil</P>
<P>When we &s;aw the place, tho twelve years after the event, many marks remained, &s;till flagrant, of this &s;cene of ruin. We &s;aw the natural bed of the Li&s;&s;a, a mere contracted rivulet; and on it's banks the ve&s;tiges of a &s;tony channel, &s;preading far and wide, almo&s;t enough to contain the waters of the Rhine, or the Danube. It was computed from the flood-marks, that in many parts the &s;tream mu&s;t have been five or &s;ix yards deep; and near a hundred broad; and if it's great velo|city be added to this weight of water, it's moment will be found equal to almo&s;t any effect.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">On the banks of this &s;tony channel, we &s;aw a few &s;cattered hou&s;es, a part of the village of Brackenthwait, which had a won|derful e&s;cape. They &s;tood at the bottom of Gra&s;mer, rather on a ri&s;ing ground; and the current, taking it's fir&s;t direction towards them, would have undermined them in a few moments, (for the &s;oil was in&s;tantly laid bare) had not a projection of native rock, the in|terior &s;tratum, on which the hou&s;es had un|knowingly been founded, re&s;i&s;ted the current, and given it a new direction. Unle&s;s this had intervened, it is probable, the&s;e hou&s;es, and all the inhabitants of them (&s;o in&s;tan|taneous was the ruin) had been &s;wept away together.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing farther along the vale, we &s;aw other marks of the fury of the inundation; where, bridges had been thrown down, hou&s;es carried off, and woods rooted up. But it's effects upon a &s;tone-cau&s;eway were thought the mo&s;t &s;urprizing. This fabric was of great thickne&s;s; and &s;upported, on each &s;ide, by an enormous bank of earth. The memory of man could trace it, unaltered in any particular, near a hundred years: but by the &s;oundne&s;s and firmne&s;s of it's parts and texture, it &s;eemed
<PB N="7" REF="9">
as if it had &s;tood for ages. It was almo&s;t a doubt, whether it were a work of nature, or of art. This ma&s;&s;y mole the deluge not only carried off; but, as if it turned it into &s;port, made it's very foundations the channel of it's own &s;tream.</P>
<P>Having done all this mi&s;chief, not only here, but in many other parts, the Li&s;&s;a threw all it's waters into the Cocker, where an end was put to it's deva&s;tation: for tho the Cocker was unable to contain &s;o immen&s;e an increa&s;e; yet as it flows through a more level country, the deluge &s;pread far and wide, and wa&s;ted it's &s;trength in one va&s;t, &s;tagnant inundation.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed through the vale of Buter|mer, we entered another beautiful &s;cene, the vale of Lorton.</P>
<P>This vale, like all the pa&s;t, pre&s;ents us with a &s;cene intirely new. No lakes, no rocks are here, to blend the ideas of dignity, and grandeur with that of beauty. All is &s;implicity, and repo&s;e. Nature, in this &s;cene, lays totally a&s;ide her maje&s;tic frown, and wears only a lovely &s;mile.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">The vale of Lorton is of the extended kind, running a con&s;iderable way between mountains, which range at about a mile's di&s;tance. They are near enough to &s;creen it from the &s;torm; and yet not &s;o impending as to exclude the &s;un. Their &s;ides, tho not &s;mooth, are not much diver&s;ified. A few knolls and hollows ju&s;t give a little variety to the broad lights and &s;hades, which over|&s;pread them.</P>
<P>This vale, which enjoys a rich &s;oil, is in general a rural, cultivated &s;cene; tho in many parts the ground is beautifully broken, and abrupt. A bright &s;tream, which might almo&s;t take the name of a river, pours along a rocky channel; and &s;parkles down number|le&s;s little ca&s;cades. It's banks are adorned with wood; and varied with different objects; a bridge; a mill; a hamlet; a glade over-hung with wood; or &s;ome little &s;weet rece&s;s; or natural vi&s;ta, through which the eye ranges, between irregular trees, along the windings of the &s;tream.</P>
<P>Except the mountains, nothing in all this &s;cenery is <HI>great;</HI> but every part is filled with tho&s;e &s;weet engaging pa&s;&s;ages of nature, which
<PB N="9" REF="11">
tend to &s;ooth the mind, and in&s;till tranquil|lity.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;The pa&s;&s;ions to divine repo&s;e</L>
<L>Per&s;uaded yield: and love and joy alone</L>
<L>Are waking: love and joy, &s;uch as await</L>
<L>An angel's meditation&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Scenes of this kind, (however plea&s;ing) in which few objects occur, either of <HI>grandeur</HI> or <HI>peculiarity,</HI> in a &s;ingular manner elude the powers of verbal de&s;cription. They al|mo&s;t elude the power of colours. The &s;oft and elegant form of beauty is hard to hit: while the &s;trong, har&s;h feature is a mark, which every pencil can &s;trike.</P>
<P>But tho a <HI>peculiar</HI> difficulty attends the verbal de&s;cription of the&s;e mild, and quiet haunts of nature; yet undoubtedly <HI>all</HI> her &s;cenery is ill-attempted in language.</P>
<P>Mountains, rocks, broken ground, water, and wood, are the &s;imple materials, which &s;he employs in all her beautiful pictures: but the variety and harmony, with which &s;he employs them, are infinite. In de&s;cription the&s;e words &s;tand only for general ideas: on her charts each is detailed into a thou&s;and
<PB N="10" REF="12">
varied forms. Words may give the great outlines of a &s;cene. They can mea&s;ure the dimen&s;ions of a lake. They can hang it's &s;ides with wood. They can rear a ca&s;tle on &s;ome projecting rock: or place an i&s;land near this, or the other &s;hore. But their range extends no farther. They cannot mark the characteri&s;tic di&s;tinctions of each &s;cene &mdash;the touches of nature&mdash;her living tints&mdash;her endle&s;s varieties, both in form and colour. &mdash;In a word, all her elegant peculiarities are beyond their reach. Language is equally unable to convey the&s;e to the eye; as the eye is to convey the various divi&s;ions of &s;ound to the ear.</P>
<P>The pencil, it is true, offers a more per|fect mode of de&s;cription. It &s;peaks a language more intelligible; and de&s;cribes the &s;cene in &s;tronger, and more varied terms. The &s;hapes, and hues of objects it delineates, and marks, with more exactne&s;s. It gives the lake the louring &s;hade of tempe&s;t; or the glowing blu&s;h of &s;un-&s;et. It &s;preads a warmer, or a colder tint on the tufts of the fore&s;t. It adds form to the ca&s;tle; and tips it's &s;hattered battlements with light.&mdash;But all this, all that words can expre&s;s, or even the pencil de&s;cribe,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
are gro&s;s, in&s;ipid &s;ub&s;titutes of the living &s;cene<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is not at all incon&s;i&s;tent with what is &s;aid in the 119th page. <HI>Here</HI> we &s;peak chiefly of the <HI>detail</HI> of nature's works: <HI>there</HI> of the <HI>compo&s;ition.</HI> The nearer we approach the character of nature in every mode of imitation, no doubt the better: yet &s;till there are many irregularities and deformities in the natural &s;cene, which we may wi&s;h to correct&mdash;that is, to correct, by improving one part of nature by another.</NOTE>. We may be plea&s;ed with the de|&s;cription, and the picture: but the &s;oul can <HI>feel</HI> neither, unle&s;s the force of our own imagination aid the poet's, or the painter's art; exalt the idea; and <HI>picture things un&s;een.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it perhaps follows, that the perfec|tion of the art of painting is not &s;o much attained by an endeavour to form an exact re&s;emblance of nature in a <HI>nice repre&s;entation of all her minute parts,</HI> which we con&s;ider as almo&s;t impracticable, ending generally in flat|ne&s;s, and in&s;ipidity; as by aiming to give tho&s;e bold, tho&s;e &s;trong characteri&s;tic touches, which excite the imagination; and lead it to form half the picture, it&s;elf. Painting is the <HI>art of deceiving;</HI> and it's great perfection lies in the exerci&s;e of this art.</P>
<P>Hence it is that genius, and knowledge are as requi&s;ite in &s;urveying a picture, as in
<PB N="12" REF="14">
painting one. The cold, untutored eye, (tho it may enjoy the <HI>real</HI> &s;cene, (be it hi&s;tory,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory-painting is certainly the mo&s;t elevated &s;pecies. Nothing exalts the human mind &s;o much, as to &s;ee the great actions of our fellow-creatures brought before the eye. But this plea&s;ure we &s;eldom find in painting. So much is requir|ed from the hi&s;tory-painter, &s;o intimate a knowledge both of nature and art, that we rarely &s;ee a hi&s;tory-piece, even from the be&s;t ma&s;ters, that is able to <HI>rai&s;e raptures.</HI> We may ad|mire the colouring, or the execution; or &s;ome under-part; but the <HI>&s;oul is &s;eldom reached.</HI> The imagination &s;oars beyond the picture. In the inferior walks of painting, where le&s;s is required, more of cour&s;e is performed: and tho we have few good pictures in hi&s;tory, we have many in portrait, in land&s;cape, in animal-life, dead-game, fruit, and flowers. Hi&s;tory painting is a mode of epic; and tho the literary world abounds with admirable productions in the lower walks of poetry, an epic is the wonder of an age.</NOTE> land&s;cape, or what it will) is unmoved at the fine&s;t <HI>repre&s;entation.</HI> It does not &s;ee an <HI>exact</HI> re&s;emblance of what it &s;ees abroad; and having no internal pencil, if I may &s;o &s;peak, to work within; it is utterly unable to <HI>ad|mini&s;ter</HI> a picture to it&s;elf. Whereas the learned eye<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The admirers of painting may be divided into two cla&s;&s;es:&mdash;The inferior admirer values him&s;elf on <HI>di&s;tin|gui&s;hing the ma&s;ter</HI>&mdash;on knowing the peculiar touch of each pencil; and the ruling tint of every pallet. But he has no <HI>feeling.</HI> If the picture be an <HI>original,</HI> or if it be in the ma&s;ter's <HI>be&s;t manner</HI> (which may be the ca&s;e of many a bad picture) it is the object of his veneration; tho the &s;tory be ill-told, the characters feebly marked, and a total deficiency appear in every excellence of the art.</P>
<P>The more liberal profe&s;&s;or, (and who alone is here con&s;ider|ed as capable of <HI>admini&s;tring</HI> a picture to him&s;elf) thinks the knowledge of names, (any further than as it marks excel|lence, till we get a better criterion,) is the bane of the art he admires. A work, worthy of admiration, may be produced by an inferior hand; and a paltry compo&s;ition may e&s;cape from a ma&s;ter. He would have the <HI>intrin&s;ic merit</HI> of a work, not any <HI>arbitrary &s;tamp</HI> proclaim it's excellence. In examining a picture, he leaves the <HI>name</HI> entirely out of the que&s;tion. It may mi&s;lead, it cannot a&s;&s;i&s;t, his judgment. The characters of nature, and the knowledge of art, are all he looks for: the re&s;t, be they Guido's, Carrache's, or Raphael's, he de&s;pi&s;es as the bubbles of picture-dealers; the mere &s;weep|ings, and refu&s;e of Italian garrets.</P></NOTE>, ver&s;ed equally in nature, and
<PB N="13" REF="15">
art, ea&s;ily compares the picture with it's archetype: and when it finds the characteri&s;tic touches of nature, the imagination immediately takes fire; and glows with a thou&s;and beau|tiful ideas, &s;ugge&s;ted only by the canvas. When the canvas therefore is &s;o artificially wrought, as to &s;ugge&s;t the&s;e ideas in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, the picture is then mo&s;t perfect. This is generally be&s;t done by little
<PB N="14" REF="16">
labour, and great knowledge. It is know|ledge only, which in&s;pires that free, that fear|le&s;s, and determined pencil, &s;o expre&s;&s;ive in a &s;kilful hand. As to the <HI>minutiae</HI> of nature, the picture&s;que eye will generally &s;ugge&s;t them better it&s;elf; and yet give the arti&s;t, as he de&s;erves, the credit of the whole.</P>
<P>We &s;ometimes indeed &s;ee pictures <HI>highly fini&s;hed,</HI> and <HI>yet full of &s;pirit.</HI> They will bear a nice examination at hand, and yet lo&s;e nothing of their di&s;tant effect. But &s;uch pic|tures are &s;o exceedingly rare, that I &s;hould think, few painters would in prudence at|tempt a laboured manner. Indeed, as pictures are not de&s;igned to be &s;een through a micro&s;|cope, but at a proper di&s;tance, it is labour thrown away<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the higher walks of painting I know of no arti&s;t, who does not lo&s;e his &s;pirit in attempting to fini&s;h highly. In the inferior walks we have a few. Among the fir&s;t we may rank Van Huy&s;um, who painted flowers, and fruits, with equal labour and &s;pirit. And yet even here, I own I have more plea&s;ure in helping my&s;elf to the&s;e delicacies from the bolder works of Bapti&s;te.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hence it is that even a rough &s;ketch, by the hand of a ma&s;ter, will often &s;trike the imagination beyond the mo&s;t fini&s;hed work.
<PB N="15" REF="17">
I have &s;een the learned eye pa&s;s unmoved along rows of pictures by the cold, and in|animate pencil of &s;uch a ma&s;ter as Carlo Marat; and &s;tart a&s;toni&s;hed, when it came to a &s;ketch of Rubens. In one ca&s;e the painter endea|vouring in vain to admini&s;ter every thing by giving the full roundne&s;s, and &s;moothne&s;s to every part, in&s;tead of the bold, characteri&s;tic touches of nature, had done too much: in the other, tho the work was left unfini&s;hed, yet many of the bold characteri&s;tic touches being thrown in, enough was done to excite the imagination of the &s;pectator, which could ea&s;ily &s;upply the re&s;t.</P>
<P>A very ingenious writer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burke on the &s;ublime and beautiful, Part II. Sect. XI.</NOTE> indeed gives an|other rea&s;on for our being better plea&s;ed with a &s;ketch, than with a fini&s;hed piece. <HI>The imagination,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is entertained with the promi&s;e of &s;omething more; and does not ac|quie&s;ce in the pre&s;ent object of the &s;en&s;e.</HI> But this ob&s;ervation, I think, is &s;carce founded on truth. It is true <HI>the imagination does not ac|quie&s;ce in the pre&s;ent object of the &s;en&s;e:</HI> but, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, not becau&s;e it is entertained
<PB N="16" REF="18">
with a <HI>promi&s;e of &s;omething more;</HI> but becau&s;e it has the power, of <HI>creating &s;omething more it&s;elf.</HI> If <HI>a promi&s;e of &s;omething more,</HI> were the cau&s;e of this plea&s;ure, it &s;hould &s;eem, that a &s;ketch, in it's rude&s;t form, would be more plea&s;ing, than when it is more advanced: for the imagination mu&s;t have &s;till <HI>higher</HI> enter|tainment in proportion to the <HI>largene&s;s</HI> of the promi&s;e. But this is not the ca&s;e. The &s;ketch, in it's naked chalk-lines, affects us little in compari&s;on. The in&s;trument mu&s;t be tuned higher, to excite vibrations in the imagination.</P>
<P>Again, on the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ition, one would imagine, that the rude beginning, or rough plan of a hou&s;e, would plea&s;e us more than the compleat pile; for <HI>the imagination is enter|tained with the promi&s;e of &s;omething more.</HI> But, I believe, no one was ever &s;o well plea&s;ed with an unfini&s;hed &s;hell, amid&s;t all it's rubbi&s;h of &s;caffolding, paper-windows, and other de|formities; as with a &s;tructure compleat in all it's members, and &s;et off with all it's proper decorations.&mdash;But on the &s;uppo&s;ition I have ventured to &s;ugge&s;t, we &s;ee why the <HI>&s;ketch</HI> may plea&s;e beyond the <HI>picture;</HI> tho the <HI>unfini&s;hed fabric</HI> di&s;appoints. An elegant hou&s;e is a
<PB N="17" REF="19">
<HI>compleat object.</HI> The imagination can ri&s;e no higher. It receives full &s;atisfaction. But a picture is <HI>not an object it&s;elf;</HI> but only the <HI>repre&s;entation</HI> of an object. We may ea&s;ily therefore conceive, that it may fall below it's archetype; and al&s;o below the imagination of the &s;pectator, who&s;e fancy may be more picture&s;que, than the hand of the arti&s;t, who compo&s;ed the picture. In this ca&s;e, a &s;ketch may afford the &s;pectator more plea&s;ure, as it gives his imagination freer &s;cope; and &s;uffers it to compleat the arti&s;t's imperfect draught from the fund of it's own richer, and more perfect ideas.</P>
<P>The variety of &s;cenes, which nature ex|hibits; and their infinite combinations, and peculiarities, to which neither language, nor colours, unaided by imagination, can, in any degree, do ju&s;tice; gave occa&s;ion to the&s;e remarks, which have carried me perhaps too far into digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We had to regret, that we &s;aw the vale of Lorton only in half it's beauty. It was at too late an hour; and the evening be&s;ides was dark. The morning had been cloudy;
<PB N="18" REF="20">
in &s;ome part of it rather tempe&s;tuous; and we thought our&s;elves then very happy in the di&s;po&s;ition of the weather: for as we had before &s;een the mountains in a clear atmo&s;|phere; it was a de&s;irable variety to &s;ee the grand effects they produced in a &s;torm. A mountain is an object of grandeur; and it's dig|nity receives new force by mixing with the clouds; and arraying it&s;elf in the maje&s;ty of darkne&s;s. Here the idea of <HI>infinity</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Page, 228.</NOTE> pro|duces &s;trongly the &s;ublime. But the chearful &s;cenes of &s;uch a vale as this, pretend not to dignity: they are mere &s;cenes of tranquillity. The early blu&s;h of dawn, the noon-tide &s;hade, or evening-glow, are the circum&s;tances, in which they mo&s;t rejoice: a &s;torm, in any &s;hape, will injure them. Here therefore we might have di&s;pen&s;ed with more light, and &s;un&s;hine. Or at the clo&s;e of day we might have wi&s;hed for a quiet, tranquil hour, when the glimmering &s;urfaces of things are &s;ome|times perhaps more plea&s;ing&mdash;at all times certainly more &s;oothing, than images of the brighte&s;t hue:
<Q><PB N="19" REF="21">
<L>When through the du&s;k ob&s;curely &s;een</L>
<L>Sweet evening-objects intervene.</L></Q></P>
<P>The evening, which grew more tempe&s;tu|ous, began to clo&s;e upon us, as we left the more beautiful parts of the vale of Lorton. We were &s;till about &s;ix miles from Ke&s;wick; and had before us a very wild country, which probably would have afforded no great amu&s;e|ment even in full day: but amid the ob&s;curity, which now over&s;pread the land&s;cape, the ima|gination was left at large; and painted many images, which perhaps did not really exi&s;t, upon the dead colouring of nature. Every great and plea&s;ing form, whether clear, or ob&s;cure, which we had &s;een during the day, now played, in &s;trong imagery before the fancy: as when the grand chorus cea&s;es, ideal mu&s;ic vibrates in the ear.</P>
<P>In one part, a view plea&s;ed us much; tho perhaps, in &s;tronger light, it might have e&s;caped notice. The road made a &s;udden dip into a little, winding valley; which being too abrupt for a carriage, was ea&s;ed by a
<PB N="20" REF="22">
bridge: and the form of the arch appeared to be what we commonly find in Roman aquaducts. The winding road; the woody valley, and broken ground below; the moun|tain beyond; the form of the bridge, which gave a cla&s;&s;ic air to the &s;cene; and the ob|&s;curity, which melted the whole into one harmonious ma&s;s; made all together a very plea&s;ing view.</P>
<P>But it &s;oon grew too dark even for the imagination to roam. It was now ten o'clock: and tho in this northern climate, the twilight of a clear &s;ummer-evening affords even at that late hour, a bright effulgence; yet now all was dark.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;A faint, erroneous ray</L>
<L>Glanced from th' imperfect &s;urfaces of things,</L>
<L>Threw half an image on the &s;training eye.</L>
<L>While wavering woods, and villages, and &s;treams,</L>
<L>And rocks, and mountain-tops, that long retained</L>
<L>Th' a&s;cending gleam, were all one &s;wimming &s;cene,</L>
<L>Uncertain if beheld&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>We could ju&s;t di&s;cern, through the dim|ne&s;s of the night, the &s;hadowy forms of the mountains, &s;ometimes blotting out half the
<PB N="21" REF="23">
&s;ky, on one &s;ide; and &s;ometimes winding round, as a gloomy barrier on the other.</P>
<P>Often too the road would appear to dive into &s;ome dark aby&s;s, a cataract roaring at the bottom: while the mountain-torrents on every &s;ide ru&s;hed down the hills in notes of various cadence, as their quantities of water, the declivities of their fall, their di&s;tances, or the intermi&s;&s;ion of the bla&s;t, brought the &s;ound fuller, or fainter to the ear; which organ became now more alert, as the imagi|nation depended rather on it, than on the eye for information.</P>
<P>The&s;e various notes of water-mu&s;ic, an|&s;wering each other from hill to hill, were a kind of tran&s;lation of that pa&s;&s;age in the p&s;alms, in which <HI>one deep</HI> is repre&s;ented <HI>calling another becau&s;e of the noi&s;e of the water-pipes.</HI></P>
<P>Among other images of the night, a lake (for the lake of Ba&s;&s;enthwait was now in view) appeared through the uncertainty of the gloom, like &s;omething of ambiguous tex|ture, &s;preading a lengthened gleam of wan, dead light under the dark &s;hade of the in|cumbent mountains: but whether this light
<PB N="22" REF="24">
was owing to vapours ari&s;ing from the valley; or whether it was water&mdash;and if water, whe|ther it was an arm of the &s;ea, a lake, or a river&mdash;to the uninformed traveller would ap|pear matter of great uncertainty. Whatever it was, it would &s;eem &s;ufficient to alarm his apprehen&s;ions; and to rai&s;e in his fancy, (now in que&s;t of dangers,) the idea of &s;omething, that might &s;top his farther progre&s;s.</P>
<P>A good turnpike-road, on which we en|tered near the village of Lorton, and a know|ledge of the country, &s;et at naught all &s;uch ideas with us: but it may ea&s;ily be conceived, that a traveller, wandering in the mid&s;t of a &s;tormy night, in a mountainous country, un|known, and unbeaten by human foot&s;teps, might feel palpitations of a very unea&s;y kind.</P>
<P>We have in O&s;&s;ian &s;ome beautiful images, which accompany a night-&s;torm in &s;uch a country as this. I &s;hall &s;ubjoin, with a few alterations, an extract from them; as it will illu&s;trate the &s;ubject before us. It is con|tained in a note on <HI>Croma;</HI> in which &s;everal bards are introduced entertaining their patron with their re&s;pective de&s;criptions of the night.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25">The &s;torm gathers on the tops of the moun|tains; and &s;preads it's black mantle before the moon. It comes forward in the maje&s;ty of darkne&s;s, moving upon the wings of the bla&s;t. It &s;weeps along the vale, and nothing can with&s;tand it's force. The lightning from the rifted cloud fla&s;hes before it: the thunder rolls among the mountains in its rear.</P>
<P>All nature is re&s;tle&s;s, and unea&s;y.</P>
<P>The &s;tag lies wakeful on the mountain-mo&s;s: the hind clo&s;e by his &s;ide. She hears the &s;torm roaring through the branches of the trees. She &s;tarts&mdash;and lies down again.</P>
<P>The heath-cock lifts his head at intervals; and returns it under his wing.</P>
<P>The owl leaves her unfini&s;hed dirge; and &s;its ruffled in her feathers in a cleft of the bla&s;ted oak.</P>
<P>The fami&s;hed fox &s;hrinks from the &s;torm, and &s;eeks the &s;helter of his den.</P>
<P>The hunter alarmed, leaps from his pallet in the lonely hut. He rai&s;es his decaying fire. His wet dogs &s;moke around him. He half-opens his cabin-door, and looks out: but he in&s;tantly retreats from the terrors of the night.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="26">For now the whole &s;torm de&s;cends. The mountain-torrents join their impetuous &s;treams. The growing river &s;wells.</P>
<P>The benighted traveller pau&s;es as he en|ters the gloomy dell. The glaring &s;ky di&s;|covers the terrors of the &s;cene. With a face of wild de&s;pair he looks round. He recol|lects neither the rock above, nor the preci|pice below. Still he urges his bewildered way. His &s;teed trembles at the frequent fla&s;h. The thunder bur&s;ts over his head&mdash;The tor|rents roar aloud.&mdash;He attempts the rapid ford.&mdash;Heard you that &s;cream?&mdash;It was the &s;hriek of death.</P>
<P>How tumultuous is the bo&s;om of the lake! The waves la&s;h it's rocky &s;ides. The boat is brimful in the cove. The oars are da&s;hed again&s;t the &s;hore.</P>
<P>What melancholy &s;hade is that &s;itting un|der the tree on the lonely beach?&mdash;I ju&s;t di&s;cern it faintly &s;hadowed out by the pale beam of the moon, pa&s;&s;ing through a thin-robed cloud.&mdash;It is a female form.&mdash;Her eyes are fixed upon the lake. Her di&s;che|velled hair floats loo&s;e around her arm, which &s;upports her pen&s;ive head.&mdash;Ah! mourn|ful
<PB N="25" REF="27">
maid! do&s;t thou &s;till expect thy lover over the lake?&mdash;Thou &s;awe&s;t his di&s;tant boat, at the clo&s;e of day, dancing upon the feathery waves.&mdash;Thy brea&s;t throbs with &s;u&s;pence: but thou knowe&s;t not yet, that he lies a corp&s;e upon the &s;hore.</P>

<P>AFTER a wet, and &s;tormy night we re|joiced to &s;ee the morning ari&s;e with all the &s;igns of a calm and &s;plendid day. We wi&s;hed for the opportunity of &s;urveying Ulle&s;|water in &s;erene, bright weather. This was the next &s;cene we propo&s;ed to vi&s;it; and with which we intended to clo&s;e our views of this picture&s;que country.</P>
<P>From Ke&s;wick we mounted a hill, on the great turnpike road to Penrith. At the &s;um|mit we left our hor&s;es; and went to examine a Druid temple, in a field on the right. The diameter of this circle is thirty-two <HI>paces;</HI> which, as nearly as could be judged from &s;o inaccurate a mode of men&s;uration, is the diameter of Stonehenge; which I once mea|&s;ured
<PB N="28" REF="29">
in the &s;ame way. But the &s;tructures are very different; tho the diameters may be nearly equal. The &s;tones here are diminutive in compari&s;on with tho&s;e on Sali&s;bury-Plain. If Stonehenge were a cathedral in it's day; this circle was little more than a country church.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;tructures, I &s;uppo&s;e, are by far the mo&s;t ancient ve&s;tiges of architecture (if we may call them architecture) which we have in England. Their rude workman&s;hip hands down the great barbarity of the times of the Druids: and furni&s;hes &s;trong proof of the &s;avage nature of the religion of the&s;e heathen prie&s;ts. Within the&s;e magical circles we may conceive any incantations to have been per|formed; and any rites of &s;uper&s;tition to have been celebrated. It is hi&s;tory, as well as poetry, when O&s;&s;ian mentions the <HI>circles of &s;tones,</HI> where our ance&s;tors, in their nocturnal orgies, invoked the &s;pirits which rode upon the winds&mdash;the awful forms of their decea&s;ed forefathers; through which, he &s;ublimely tells us, <HI>the &s;tars dimly twinkled.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30">As &s;ingular a part as the Druids make in the ancient hi&s;tory, not only of Britain, but of other countries, I know not, that I ever &s;aw any of their tran&s;actions introduced as the &s;ubject of a capital picture. That they can furni&s;h a fund of excellent imagery for poetry we know: and I &s;ee not why the &s;cenes of Caractacus might not be as well &s;uited to picture&s;que, as dramatic repre&s;entation.&mdash;And yet there is a difference. The drama depends at lea&s;t as much on &s;entiment, as on repre|&s;entation. Whereas the picture depends in|tirely on the latter. The beautiful &s;entiments of the poet are lo&s;t; and the &s;pectator mu&s;t make out the dialogue, as he is able, from the energetic looks of the figures.&mdash;Hence therefore it follows, that the &s;ame &s;ubjects are not equally calculated to &s;hine in poetry, and in painting.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;ubjects, no doubt, are be&s;t adapted to the pencil, which <HI>tell them&s;elves by action.</HI> In general, however, all animated &s;tories, which admit either of <HI>&s;trong action,</HI> or <HI>pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> are judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en. Unanimated &s;ubjects have little chance of producing an effect; parti|cularly
<PB N="30" REF="31">
love-&s;tories; which, of all others, I could wi&s;h to exclude from canvas. The language of love is &s;o difficult to tran&s;late, that I know not that I ever &s;aw a repre&s;en|tation of lovers, who were not &s;trongly marked with the character of &s;impletons.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides &s;uch &s;ubjects, as admit of &s;trong <HI>action,</HI> or <HI>pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> there are others of a more inanimate ca&s;t, which, through the peculi|arity of the characters, of which they con&s;i&s;t, can never be mi&s;taken. Such is the &s;ettle|ment of Pen&s;ylvania, painted by Mr. We&s;t. From the mixture of Engli&s;h, and Indian characters, and a variety of appo&s;ite appen|dages, the &s;tory is not only well told; but, as every picture&s;que &s;tory &s;hould be told, it is obvious at &s;ight.</P>
<P>Among &s;ubjects of this kind, are tho&s;e, which occa&s;ioned this digre&s;&s;ion&mdash;druidical &s;ubjects. I know few of the le&s;s animated kind, which would admit more picture&s;que embelli&s;hment, than a Druid-&s;acrifice. The peculiar character, and &s;avage features of the&s;e barbarous prie&s;ts&mdash;their white, flowing ve&s;t|ments&mdash;the branch of mi&s;leto, which they hold&mdash;the circular &s;tones (if they could be brought into compo&s;ition)&mdash;the &s;preading oak
<PB N="31" REF="32">
&mdash;the altar beneath it&mdash;and the milk-white &s;teer&mdash;might all together form a good pic|ture.</P>
<P>I have often admired an etching by Teipolo, which I have always conceived to be a repre|&s;entation of this &s;ubject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is contained in a book of etchings on emblematical &s;ubjects.</NOTE>. He does not in|deed introduce all the circum&s;tances of a Druid-&s;acrifice, which I have here enume|rated: but the characters are &s;uch, as exactly &s;uit the &s;ubject; and the whole &s;eems to be an excellent illu&s;tration of it.</P>
<P>After we left the temple of the Druids, we met with little which engaged our attention, till we came to the <HI>vale of St. John.</HI> This &s;cene appeared from the &s;tand, where we viewed it, to be a circular area, of about &s;ix, or &s;even miles in circumference. It is &s;ur|rounded intirely by mountains; and is watered by a &s;mall river, called the Grata.</P>
<P>The vale of St. John is e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t celebrated &s;cenes of beauty in the country: but
<PB N="32" REF="33">
it did not an&s;wer our expectation. The ground, con&s;i&s;ting of patches of fenced meadow, adorn|ed with farm-hou&s;es, and clumps of trees, was beautifully tumbled about in many parts: but the whole was rather rich, than pictu|re&s;que: and on this account, I &s;uppo&s;e, it hath obtained it's celebrity. It's circular form, every where within the &s;cope of the eye, wanted that variety, which the <HI>winding</HI> vale affords; where one part is continually rece|ding from another in all the plea&s;ing grada|tions of per&s;pective<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the &s;ame idea applied to water, page 184.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>kind</HI> of &s;cenery here, is much the &s;ame, as in the vale of Lorton: both are compo&s;ed of rural objects; but the&s;e objects are differently pre&s;ented. In the vale of Lor|ton, the hou&s;es, and hamlets, &s;eated on a wandering &s;tream, are confined to the &s;ame level; and appear of cour&s;e, <HI>one after another,</HI> as &s;o many little <HI>&s;eparate &s;cenes.</HI> Here they are &s;cattered about the inequalities of the ground, through the area of a vale, circular at lea&s;t in appearance; and offer the eye too much at once&mdash;a <HI>confu&s;ion,</HI> rather than a <HI>&s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="34">
of &s;cenery. I &s;peak however only of the <HI>general appearance</HI> of the vale: it contains undoubtedly many beautiful &s;cenes, if we had had time to explore them.</P>
<P>The plan, or ground-plot, of the vale of Tempe was &s;omewhat &s;imilar to this of St. John. Nature &s;eems in both to have wrought on the &s;ame model; excepting only that the furniture of that very celebrated &s;cene of an|tiquity was more picture&s;que.</P>
<P>The vale of Tempe, like this, was circular, and incompa&s;&s;ed with mountains. But it's area was compo&s;ed of level lawns, (at lea&s;t, we &s;uppo&s;e, not ri&s;ing uniformly before the eye,) inter&s;per&s;ed with wood; which in many parts was thick, and clo&s;e; and mu&s;t every where have intercepted &s;ome portion of the mountain-line, and broken the regularity of a circular <HI>&s;hape.</HI></P>
<P>The mountains too in Tempe were of a more beautiful &s;tructure; abrupt, hung with rock, and finely adorned with wood.&mdash;At the head of the vale was a grand, rocky cha&s;m, &s;haded with a profu&s;ion of woody &s;cenery; through which the whole weight of
<PB N="34" REF="35">
the river Peneus forced it's way, with a tre|mendous &s;ound; and having been da&s;hed into foam and vapours by the fall, reunited it's &s;trength at the bottom, and poured through the vale in a wild, impetuous torrent, roaring over rocks and &s;helves, till it found an exit, through the folding of the mountains on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide.</P>
<P>Elian indeed tells us, that the &s;tream was &s;mooth: but as Ovid's de&s;cription is more picture&s;que, the reader will give me leave to con&s;ider his authority as more deci&s;ive. His view of Tempe is very noble: but as he meant principally to de&s;cribe the palace of a river god, which lay among the caverns, and re|ce&s;&s;es of the rocky cha&s;m at the entrance of the vale, his &s;ubject naturally led him to dwell chiefly on the ca&s;cade, which was undoubtedly the greate&s;t ornament of the place.</P>

<P><PB N="35" REF="36">A vale thus circum&s;tanced is &s;o plea&s;ing, that other poets have &s;eized the idea in their de&s;criptions.

<P>The vale of St. John was, &s;ome years ago, the &s;cene of one of tho&s;e terrible inun|dations, which wa&s;ted lately the vale of Brack|enthwait. I &s;hall relate the circum&s;tances of it, as they were given to me on the &s;pot: but as we had them not perhaps on the be&s;t au|thority, they may, in &s;ome particulars, be overcharged.</P>
<P>It was on the 22d of Augu&s;t 1749, that this di&s;a&s;ter happened. That day, which had been preceded by weather uncommonly clo&s;e and &s;ultry; &s;et in with a gloomy a&s;pect. The blackne&s;s gathered, more, and more, from every quarter. The air was hot beyond &s;uf|ferance. The whole atmo&s;phere, and every thing around was in a &s;tate of perfect &s;tag|nation. Not a leaf was in motion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the inhabitants of the vale heard a &s;trange noi&s;e in various parts around them: but whether it was in the air, or whether it aro&s;e from the mountains, they could not a&s;certain. It was like the hollow
<PB N="37" REF="38">
murmur of a ri&s;ing wind, among the tops of trees. This noi&s;e (which in a &s;maller degree is not an uncommon prelude to a &s;torm) continued without intermi&s;&s;ion about two hours; when a tempe&s;t of wind, and rain, and thunder, and lightning &s;ucceeded; which was violent, beyond any thing, remembered in former times; and la&s;ted, without pau&s;e, near three hours.</P>
<P>During this &s;torm the cataract fell upon the mountain, on the north of the vale; or as &s;ome people thought, tho I &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e without any probability, bur&s;t from the bowels of it. The &s;ide of that mountain is a continued precipice, through the &s;pace of a mile. This whole tract, we were told, was covered, in an in&s;tant, with one conti|nuous ca&s;cade of roaring torrent (an appearance, which mu&s;t have equalled the fall of Niagara) &s;weeping all before it from the top of the mountain to the bottom. There, like that other inundation, it followed the channel of the brooks it met with; and &s;hewed &s;imilar effects of it's fury.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e effects was a&s;toni&s;hing. The fragments of rock, and deluges of &s;tone, and &s;and, which were &s;wept from the mountain
<PB N="38" REF="39">
by the torrent, choked one of the &s;treams, which received it at the bottom. The water, thus pent up, and receiving continually va&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength, after rolling &s;ullenly about that part of the vale in frightful whirl|pools, at length forced a new channel through a &s;olid rock, which we were informed, it disjointed in &s;ome fractured crevice, and made a cha&s;m at lea&s;t ten feet wide. Many of the fragments were carried to a great di&s;tance; and &s;ome of them were &s;o large, that a dozen hor&s;es could &s;carce move them. We were &s;orry afterwards, that we had not &s;een this remarkable cha&s;m: but we had not time to go in que&s;t of it.</P>
<P>From the vale of St. John we a&s;cended a &s;teep hill, called Branthwait-cragg; where being obliged to leave the great road in our way to Ulle&s;water, and inve&s;tigate a pathle&s;s de&s;ert over the mountains, which invironed us; we put our&s;elves under the conduct of a guide.</P>
<P>The&s;e mountains were covered with a pro|fu&s;ion of huge &s;tones, and detached rocks; among which we found many old people,
<PB N="39" REF="40">
and children, from the neighbouring villages, gathering a &s;pecies of white lychen, that grows upon the craggs; and which we heard had been found very u&s;eful in dying a mur|ray-colour.</P>
<P>Among the difficulties of our rout over the&s;e mountains, the bogs and mora&s;&s;es we met with, were the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome. We were often obliged to di&s;mount; and in &s;ome parts the &s;urface could hardly bear a man. Where ru&s;hes grew, our guide informed us, the ground was firme&s;t. We endeavoured therefore, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to make the little tu&s;&s;ocks of the&s;e plants the ba&s;is of our foot&s;teps. But as we could not convey this intelligence to our hor&s;es, they often plunged very deep.</P>
<P>In &s;everal parts of our ride, we had a view of that grand clu&s;ter of mountains, which forms a circle in the heart of Cumberland; and makes a back ground to the central views from almo&s;t every part of the extremities of that county. The&s;e mountains unite on the &s;outh with tho&s;e of We&s;tmoreland. The &s;ide next us was compo&s;ed of Skiddaw&mdash;Threlkate-fell,
<PB N="40" REF="41">
a part of which is called Saddle-back&mdash; and Gri&s;edale-fell. As we rode nearer the northern limit of this chain, Skiddaw, which is by much the highe&s;t mountain, appeared, in per&s;pective, the lea&s;t. Behind the&s;e moun|tains ari&s;e, in order, Mo&s;edale-fell&mdash;Carric&mdash; and Caudbeck&mdash;the tops of which we &s;ome|times &s;aw, from the higher grounds, peering, in their blue attire, over the concave parts of the browner mountains, which &s;tood nearer the eye.</P>
<P>Between us, and this circular chain, which occupied the whole horizon on the left, was &s;pread a very exten&s;ive vale; &s;tretching from &s;ide to &s;ide hardly le&s;s than &s;even or eight miles; and in length winding out of &s;ight. It is a &s;cene of little beauty, except what ari&s;es from the gradation of di&s;tance: but it &s;ugge&s;ts an idea of greatne&s;s; which &s;pace, and grand boundaries, however unadorned, will always &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>This idea hath &s;ometimes mi&s;led the ta&s;tle&s;s improver of little &s;cenes. He has heard, that <HI>&s;pace gives beauty;</HI> but not knowing how to accommodate the rule to circum&s;tances, he

often &s;hews all that is to be &s;een; when, in fact, he &s;hould have hid half of it, as a deformity. <HI>Mere</HI> &s;pace gives the idea of <HI>grandeur,</HI> rather than of <HI>beauty.</HI> Such an idea the ocean pre&s;ents. But a <HI>little</HI> &s;cene cannot pre&s;ent it. <HI>Grandeur</HI> therefore is not attained by attempting it; while <HI>beauty</HI> is often lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Along this vale ran the great road we had ju&s;t left; which was no little ornament to it. The mazy cour&s;e of a river is a &s;till nobler object of the &s;ame kind: but a great road is no bad &s;ub&s;titute; and is in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;uperior. The <HI>river</HI> being on a level, and contained within banks, is generally too much hid, unle&s;s it be viewed from an ele|vated point: but the <HI>road</HI> following the ine|qualities of the ground, is ea&s;ily traced by the eye, as it winds along the &s;everal eleva|tions and depre&s;&s;ions it meets with; and has therefore more variety in it's cour&s;e.</P>
<P>On the right, forming the other &s;ide of this exten&s;ive vale, ari&s;e &s;everal very high
<PB N="42" REF="44">
mountains; among which Hara-&s;ide, and White-pike are the mo&s;t magnificent. At the bottom of the&s;e, verging towards the &s;kirts of the vale, are other hills le&s;s formidable: but two of them, called the Mell-fells, are very remarkable; being &s;haped like earthen graves, in a country church-yard.</P>
<P>A little before we approached the Mell-fells, the path we pur&s;ued, led us under a towering rocky hill, which is known by the name of <HI>Wolf's-cragg,</HI> and is probably one of the monuments of this animal remaining in Britain. It is a fortre&s;s intirely adapted to a garri&s;on of wolves; from whence they might plunder the vale, which was &s;pread before them; and make prey of every thing, as far as the eye could reach. Such a &s;cene, in painting, would be highly characterized by &s;uch appendages. It would have plea&s;ed Ridinger. If that picture&s;que naturali&s;t had been in que&s;t of a wolf-&s;cene, he could not have found a better.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45">When we had pa&s;&s;ed this range of moun|tains, we got more into a beaten path, lead|ing to the village of Matterdale, about a mile only from Ulle&s;water; which was &s;till intirely excluded from our &s;ight by high grounds. Here we di&s;mi&s;&s;ed our guide, and were directed into Gobray-park, which is the northern boundary of the lake.</P>
<P>This part of the country we found well inhabited; and the roads, at this &s;ea&s;on, much frequented. It was about the time of a &s;tatute-fair; when the young people of the country leave their old &s;ervices, and go to their new: and we were not a little en|tertained with the &s;implicity, and variety of the &s;everal groups and figures we met, both on hor&s;eback, and on foot.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the picture&s;que inhabitants of a land&s;cape. The dre&s;&s;ed-out figures, and gaudy carriages, along the great roads of the capital, afford them not. The pencil rejects with indignation the &s;plendor of art. In grand &s;cenes, even the pea&s;ant cannot be admitted,
<PB N="44" REF="46">
if he be employed in the low occupations of his profe&s;&s;ion: the &s;pade, the &s;cythe, and the rake are all excluded.</P>
<P>Moral, and picture&s;que ideas do not al|ways coincide. In a moral light, cultivation, in all it's parts, is plea&s;ing; the hedge, and the furrow; the waving corn field, and the ripened &s;heaf. But all the&s;e, the picture&s;que eye, in que&s;t of &s;cenes of grandeur, and beauty, looks at with di&s;gu&s;t. It ranges after nature, untamed by art, and bur&s;ting wildly into all it's irregular forms.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Juvat arva videre</L>
<L>Non ra&s;tris hominum, non ulli obnoxia curae.</L></Q>
<P>It is thus al&s;o in the introduction of figures. In a moral view, the indu&s;trious mechanic is a more plea&s;ing object, than the loitering pea&s;ant. But in a picture&s;que light, it is otherwi&s;e. The arts of indu&s;try are rejected; and even idlene&s;s, if I may &s;o &s;peak, adds dignity to a character. Thus the lazy cow|herd re&s;ting on his pole; or the pea&s;ant lol|ling on a rock, may be allowed in the grande&s;t &s;cenes; while the laborious mechanic, with his impliments of labour, would be repul&s;ed.
<PB N="45" REF="47">
The fi&s;herman, it is true, may follow his calling upon the lake: but he is indebted for this privilege, not to his art; but to the picture&s;que apparatus of it&mdash;his boat, and his nets, which qualify his art. <HI>They</HI> are the objects: <HI>he</HI> is but an appendage. Place him on the &s;hore, as a &s;ingle figure, with his rod, and line; and his art would ruin him. In a chearful glade, along a purling brook, near &s;ome mill, or cottage, let him angle, if he plea&s;e: in &s;uch a &s;cene the picture&s;que eye takes no offence. But let him take care not to introduce the vulgarity of his employment in a &s;cene of grandeur.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that figures, which thus take their importance merely from not mixing with low, mechanic arts, are at be&s;t only <HI>picture&s;que appendages.</HI> They are of a negative nature, neither adding to the grandeur of the idea, nor taking from it. They merely and &s;imply <HI>adorn</HI> a &s;cene.</P>
<P>The characters, which are mo&s;t <HI>&s;uited to the&s;e &s;cenes</HI> of grandeur, are &s;uch as impre&s;s us with &s;ome idea of greatne&s;s, wildne&s;s, or ferocity; all which touch on the &s;ublime.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48">Figures in long, folding draperies; gyp&s;ies; banditti; and &s;oldiers,&mdash;not in modern regi|mentals; but as Virgil paints them,
<Q>&mdash;longis adnixi ha&s;tis, et &s;cuta tenentes;</Q>
are all marked with one or other of the&s;e characters: and mixing with the magnificence, wildne&s;s, or horror of the place, they pro|perly coale&s;ce; and reflecting the &s;ame images, add a deeper tinge to the character of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>For the truth of all the&s;e remarks I might appeal to the deci&s;ive judgment of Salvator Ro&s;a; who &s;eems to have thoroughly &s;tudied propriety in figures, e&s;pecially in &s;cenes of grandeur. His works are a model on this head. We have a book of figures, particu|larly compo&s;ed for &s;cenery of this kind, and etched by him&s;elf. In this collection there is great variety, both in the characters, groups, and dre&s;&s;es: but I do not remember, either there, or in any other of his works, a low, mechanic character. All his figures are either of (what I have called) the <HI>negative</HI> kind; or marked with &s;ome trait of <HI>greatne&s;s, wild|ne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>ferocity.</HI> Of this la&s;t &s;pecies his
<PB N="47" REF="49">
figures generally partook: his grand &s;cenes being inhabited chiefly by banditti.</P>
<P>I met with a pa&s;&s;age, not a little illu&s;tra|tive of the&s;e remarks on figures, in the tra|vels of Mr. Thickne&s;s through Spain.</P>
<P>"The wor&s;t &s;ort of beggars, &s;ays he, in Spain are the troops of male, and female gyp&s;ies. They are of the genuine breed, and differ widely from all other gyp&s;ies; and I may &s;ay, from all other human beings. I often met troops of the&s;e people; and when an interview happens in roads very di&s;tant from towns, or dwellings, it is not very plea|&s;ing: for they a&s;k, as if they knew they were not to be refu&s;ed; and I dare &s;ay often com|mit murders, when they can commit them by &s;urprize. They are extremely &s;warthy, with hair as black as jet; and form very pic|ture&s;que groups under the &s;hade of the rocks and trees of the Pyraenean mountains, where they &s;pend their evenings: and live &s;uitably to the climate; where bread, and water, and idlene&s;s, are preferable to better fare, and hard-labour."</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>ON de&s;cending the hill from Matterdale, before we came to the lake, we had a beautiful <HI>&s;pecimen</HI> (as the naturali&s;ts &s;peak) of what in this country is called a <HI>gill.</HI> The road carried us along the edge of one of it's precipices: but the cha&s;m was &s;o intirely filled with wood, that when we looked down, we could not &s;ee into it. Even the &s;un-beams, unable to enter, re&s;ted only on the tufted foliage of the trees, which grew from the &s;ides.&mdash;But though the eye was excluded, the ear was &s;oothed by the harmony of an invi&s;ible torrent; who&s;e notes, &s;ounding along innu|merable broken falls, and &s;oftened by a&s;cending through the trees, were very melodious.</P>
<P>A winding road brought us to the bottom; where the torrent tumbling out of the wood, received us. We had a &s;hort view into the
<PB N="50" REF="51">
deep rece&s;&s;es of the &s;cene, through the branches of the trees, which &s;tretched over the &s;tream; but we had not time, to penetrate the alluring &s;hade.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed over more high grounds, we came at length in view of the lake. The fir&s;t catch of it was thus pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>A road occupied the neare&s;t part of the land&s;cape, winding around a broken cliff; which ro&s;e con&s;iderably on the left. A portion of a di&s;tant mountain appeared on the right, with a &s;mall part of the lake at it's foot. The fore-ground was well-di&s;po&s;ed; and the di&s;tant mountain, which fell into the lake, beautifully tinted. The compo&s;ition, as far as it went, was very correct: but we yet &s;aw only enough to excite our curio&s;ity; and to give us, from the bearing of the land, a general idea of the lake.</P>
<P>Ulle&s;water is the large&s;t lake in this coun|try, except Windermere; being eight miles long; and about two broad in the wide&s;t part; tho, in general, it rarely exceeds a mile in
<PB REF="52">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="51" REF="53">
breadth. It points nearly north, and &s;outh; as mo&s;t of the&s;e lakes do; but being placed at an <HI>extremity</HI> of the barrier-mountains, it af|fords a greater variety than is exhibited by &s;uch lakes, as are <HI>invironed</HI> by them. The&s;e hav|ing few accompaniments, receive their character chiefly from the &s;urrounding de&s;olation. Such a lake is Wyburn. Windermere, on the other hand, Ke&s;wick, Butermer, and Ulle&s;|water may all be called <HI>boundary-lakes.</HI> One end of each participates more of the rugged country; and the other of the cultivated: tho each end participates, in &s;ome degree, of both. A few traits of romantic &s;cenery are added to the tamene&s;s of one end; and the native horror of the other is &s;oftened by a few chearful appendages.</P>
<P>The form of Ulle&s;water re&s;embles a Z; only there is no angular acutene&s;s in it's line. It &s;preads every where in an ea&s;y curve; beau|tifully broken in &s;ome parts by promontories. &mdash;The middle reach contains in length near two thirds of the lake. The &s;outhern &s;ide is mountainous; and becomes more &s;o, as it verges towards the we&s;t. As the mountains approach the north, they glide (as we have &s;een is u&s;ual in <HI>boundary-lakes</HI>) into meadows
<PB N="52" REF="54">
and pa&s;tures. The northern and we&s;tern &s;ides contain a great variety of woody and rocky &s;cenes; but the&s;e al&s;o, as they approach the ea&s;t, become &s;mooth and fertilized. At the &s;outhern point, under impending mountains, lies the village of Patterdale.&mdash;With this ge|neral idea of Ulle&s;water, let us return to the de&s;cent from Matterdale, where we caught the fir&s;t view of it.</P>
<P>As we de&s;cended a little further, the whole &s;cene of the lake opened before us; and &s;uch a &s;cene, as almo&s;t drew from us the apo&s;trophe of the inraptured bard,
<Q>Vi&s;ions of glory, &s;pare my aching &s;ight!</Q></P>
<P>Among all the <HI>vi&s;ions</HI> of this inchanting country, we had &s;een nothing &s;o beautifully &s;ublime, &s;o correctly picture&s;que as this.&mdash; And yet I am aver&s;e to make compari&s;ons; e&s;pecially on &s;eeing a country but once. Much depends on the circum&s;tances of light, and weather. I would wi&s;h therefore only to &s;ay, that I was <HI>more plea&s;ed</HI> with Ulle&s;water, than with any lake I had &s;een; adding, at the &s;ame time, that we were fortunate in a concurrence
<PB N="53" REF="55">
of incidents, that aided it's beauty. We had hitherto &s;een all the lakes we had vi&s;ited, under a rough, or cloudy &s;ky: and tho their dignity was certainly increa&s;ed by that circum&s;tance; yet the beauty of a lake in &s;plendid, &s;erene weather, aided, at this time, by the powers of contra&s;t, made a wonderful impre&s;&s;ion on the imagination.</P>
<P>"The effect of the <HI>&s;ublime,</HI> Mr. Burke in|forms us, is <HI>a&s;toni&s;hment;</HI> and the effect of <HI>beauty,</HI> is <HI>plea&s;ure:</HI> but when the two ingre|dients mix, the effect, he &s;ays, is in a good mea&s;ure de&s;troyed in both. They con&s;titute a &s;pecies &s;omething different both from the &s;ub|lime and beautiful, which I have before called <HI>fine:</HI> but this kind, I imagine, has not &s;uch a power on the pa&s;&s;ions, either as va&s;t bodies have, which are endowed with the corre&s;pond|ent qualities of the &s;ublime; or as the qualities of beauty have, when united in a &s;mall object. The affection produced by large bodies, adorned with the &s;poils of beauty, is a tention conti|nually
<PB N="54" REF="56">
relieved; which approaches to the nature of mediocrity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sublime and beautiful, part IV. &s;ect. 25.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>This refined rea&s;oning does not &s;eem intirely grounded on experience.&mdash;I do not remember any &s;cene in which beauty and &s;ublimity, ac|cording to my ideas, are more blended than in this: and tho Mr. Burke's ideas of beauty are perhaps more exceptionable, than his ideas of the &s;ublime; yet it happens, that mo&s;t of the qualities, which he predicates of both, unite al&s;o in this &s;cene. Their effect therefore, according to his argument, &s;hould be de&s;troyed. But the feelings of every lover of nature, on viewing the&s;e &s;cenes, I dare be bold to &s;ay, would revolt from &s;uch rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>The fore-ground of the grand view before us, is a part of Gobray-park, which belongs to the duke of Norfolk; rough, broken, and woody. Among the old oaks, which inriched it, herds of deer, and cattle grazed in groups. Beyond this is &s;pread an exten&s;ive reach of the lake, winding round a rocky promontory on the left;
<PB REF="57">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="55" REF="58">
which is the point of a mountain, called Mar|tindale-fell, or Place-fell; the &s;outhern boun|dary of the lake. This promontory uniting with the mountain, lets it ea&s;ily down into the water, as by a &s;tep. An <HI>he&s;itation,</HI> if I may &s;o call it, of this kind, ea&s;es greatly the heavine&s;s of a line. In a <HI>di&s;tance,</HI> it is of le&s;s con&s;equence: but in all the <HI>nearer</HI> grounds, it is nece&s;&s;ary. I &s;peak chiefly however of tho&s;e &s;cenes, in which beauty, and grandeur are combined. In tho&s;e of &s;imple grandeur, and &s;ublimity, as in that of Penmanmaur, for in&s;tance, in north Wales, the heavy line, which is very remarkable in that &s;cene, per|haps &s;trengthens the effect.</P>
<P>Martindale-fell is intirely unplanted: but it's line, and &s;urface are both well varied. Num|berle&s;s breaks (little vallies, and knolls) give it a lightne&s;s, without injuring it's &s;implicity.</P>
<P>Such was the di&s;po&s;ition of the objects, on the left of the lake: on the right, two woody promontories, pur&s;uing each other in per&s;pec|tive, made a beautiful contra&s;t with the &s;mooth continuity of Martindale-fell.</P>
<P>In front, the di&s;tance was compo&s;ed of mountains, falling gently into the lake; near
<PB N="56" REF="59">
the edge of which lies the village of Patter|dale.</P>
<P>We took this view at a point, which had ju&s;t &s;o much elevation, as to give a variety to the lines of the lake. As we de&s;cended to the water, the view was &s;till grand, and beautiful, but had lo&s;t &s;ome of it's more picture&s;que beauties: it had lo&s;t the fore-ground: it had lo&s;t the &s;weeping line round the mountain on the left: and it had lo&s;t the rece&s;s between the two woody promontories on the right. The whole margin of the lake was nearly reduced to one &s;traight line.&mdash;The beauty of a view, e&s;pecially in lake-&s;cenery, we have be|fore ob&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 96. Vol. I.</NOTE>, depends greatly on the nice po&s;ition of it's point.</P>
<P>Having &s;pent &s;ome time in examining this very inchanting &s;cene, we &s;kirted the lake towards Patterdale, on a tolerable road, which runs from one end of it to the other: on the &s;outh it is continued to Amble&s;ide; on the north, to Penrith. I call it a tolerable road; but I mean only for hor&s;es. It has not the
<PB N="57" REF="60">
quartering and commodious width of a car|riage road.</P>
<P>As we le&s;t Gobray-park, we took our rout along the margin of the fir&s;t of tho&s;e woody promontories on the right. We were carried by the &s;ide of the lake, through clo&s;e lanes, and thick groves: yet not &s;o thick, but that we had every where, through the openings of the trees, and windings of the road, views in front, and on the right, into woody re|ce&s;&s;es; &s;ome of which were very plea&s;ing: and on the left, the lake, and all it's di&s;tant furniture, broke frequently upon us.</P>
<P>After &s;kirting the fir&s;t wooded promontory, which carried us about a mile, the road turned &s;uddenly to the right, and led us round into the &s;econd, ri&s;ing a con&s;iderable height above the water.&mdash;In this promontory, a new &s;cene opened: the woods became intermixed with rock; and a great variety of very beautiful fore-grounds were produced. The rocks, through which the road was &s;ometimes cut, were chiefly on our right.&mdash;In this promon|tory
<PB N="58" REF="61">
al&s;o, as well as in the other, we were amu&s;ed with catches of the lake, and of Mar|tindale-fell, through the trees.</P>
<P>Scenes, like the&s;e, are adapted to every &s;tate of the &s;ky. They were beautiful in the calm &s;ea&s;on, in which we &s;aw them; and in which indeed we wi&s;hed to &s;ee them. But they would have received peculiar advantages al&s;o from a &s;torm. The objects are all in that great &s;tyle, which is &s;uited to the vio|lences of nature. The imagination would have ri&s;en with the tempe&s;t, and given a double grandeur to every awful form.&mdash;The trees, in the mean time, which rear them|&s;elves &s;tage above &s;tage, upon the moun|tain's brow, and &s;pread down to the very road, would have made a noble in&s;trument for the hollow bla&s;t to &s;ound, con&s;i&s;ting of various notes: while the &s;urges of the lake, re&s;ounding among the caverns, and da&s;hing again&s;t the rocks, many fathoms below, would have aided the concert with new notes of ter|rific harmony.</P>

<P>The mind is not always indeed in uni&s;on with &s;uch &s;cenes, and circum&s;tances, as the&s;e. When it does not happen to be &s;o, no effect can be produced. Sometimes indeed the &s;cene may draw the mind into uni&s;on; if it be not under the impre&s;&s;ion of any &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion of an oppo&s;ite kind; but in a &s;ort of neutral &s;tate. The effect however will always be &s;tronge&s;t, when the mind happens to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of ideas congenial to the &s;cene&mdash;when, in a <HI>kindly mood of melancholy,</HI> it feels it&s;elf &s;oothed by the objects around.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the mu&s;ic of winds and tem|pe&s;ts, the ecchoes, which are excited in dif|ferent parts of this lake, are &s;till more grand, and affecting. More or le&s;s they accompany all lakes, that are circum&s;cribed by lofty, and rocky &s;creens. We found them on Winder|mere; we found them on Derwentwater. But
<PB N="60" REF="63">
every lake, being &s;urrounded by rocks and mountains of a &s;tructure peculiar to it&s;elf, forms a variety of in&s;tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> and, of cour&s;e, a variety of &s;ounds. The ecchoes therefore of no two lakes are alike; unle&s;s they are mere monotoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>We took notice of a very grand eccho on the we&s;tern &s;hores of the great i&s;land in Win|dermere: but the mo&s;t celebrated ecchoes are &s;aid to be found on Ulle&s;water; in &s;ome of which the &s;ound of a cannon is di&s;tinctly reverberated &s;ix, or &s;even times. It fir&s;t rolls over the head in one va&s;t peal.&mdash;Then &s;ub|&s;iding a few &s;econds, it ri&s;es again in a grand, interrupted bur&s;t, perhaps on the right.&mdash; Another &s;olemn pau&s;e en&s;ues. Then the &s;ound ari&s;es again on the left.&mdash;Thus thrown from rock to rock, in a &s;ort of aerial per&s;pective, it is caught again perhaps by &s;ome nearer promontory; and returning full on the ear, &s;urprizes you, after you thought all had been over, with as great a peal as at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But the grande&s;t effect of this kind is pro|duced by a <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ive</HI> di&s;charge of cannon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The duke of Portland, who has property in this neigh|bourhood, has a ve&s;&s;el on the lake, with bra&s;s guns, for the purpo&s;e of exciting ecchoes.</NOTE>;
<PB N="61" REF="64">
at the interval of a few &s;econds between each di&s;charge. The effect of the fir&s;t is not over, when the ecchoes of the &s;econd, the third, or perhaps of the fourth, begin. Such a va|riety of awful &s;ounds, mixing, and commix|ing, and at the &s;ame moment heard from all &s;ides, have a wonderful effect on the mind; as if the very foundations of every rock on the lake were giving way; and the whole &s;cene, from &s;ome &s;trange convul&s;ion, were falling into general ruin.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ounds, which are all of the terrific kind, are &s;uited chiefly to &s;cenes of grandeur during &s;ome moment of wildne&s;s, when the lake is under the agitation of a &s;torm. In a calm, &s;till evening, the gradations of an eccho, dying away in di&s;tant thunder, are certainly heard with mo&s;t advantage. But that is a different idea. You attend then only to the <HI>ecchoes</HI> them&s;elves. When you take the <HI>&s;cene</HI> into the combination; and attend to the effect of the <HI>whole together;</HI> no doubt &s;uch &s;ounds, as are of the mo&s;t violent kind, are be&s;t &s;uited to moments of the greate&s;t uproar.</P>
<P>But there is another &s;pecies of ecchoes, which are as well adapted to the lake in all it's &s;tillne&s;s, and tranquillity, as the others

are to it's wildne&s;s, and confu&s;ion: and which recommend them&s;elves chiefly to tho&s;e feel|ings, which depend on the gentler move|ments of the mind. In&s;tead of cannon, let a few French-horns, and clarionets be intro|duced. Softer mu&s;ic than &s;uch loud wind-in&s;truments, would &s;carce have power to vi|brate. The effect is now wonderfully changed. The &s;ound of a cannon is heard in bur&s;ts. It is the mu&s;ic only of thunder. But the <HI>continuation</HI> of <HI>mu&s;ical &s;ounds</HI> forms a <HI>continua|tion</HI> of <HI>mu&s;ical ecchoes;</HI> which reverberating around the lake, are exqui&s;itely melodious in their &s;everal gradations; and form a thou&s;and &s;ymphonies, playing together from every part. The variety of notes is inconceivable. The ear is not equal to their innumerable combi|nations. It li&s;tens to a &s;ymphony dying away at a di&s;tance; when other melodious &s;ounds ari&s;e clo&s;e at hand. The&s;e have &s;carce attracted the attention; when a different mode of harmony ari&s;es from another quarter. In &s;hort, every rock is vocal, and the whole lake is transformed into a kind of magical &s;cene; in which every promontory &s;eems peopled by aerial beings, an&s;wering each other in cele&s;tial mu&s;ic.</P>
<Q><PB N="63" REF="66">
<L>&mdash;How often from the &s;teep</L>

<L>Singing their great Creator? Oft in bands</L>
<L>While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk,</L>

<P>We had now almo&s;t &s;kirted the two woody promontories in our rout to Patterdale. The conclu&s;ion is the grande&s;t part of the whole &s;cenery. It is a bold projection of rock finely marked, and adorned with hanging woods; under the beetling &s;ummit of which the road makes a &s;udden turn. This is the point of the &s;econd promontory; and, I be|lieve, is known by the name of <HI>Stibray-cragg.</HI></P>
<P>The trees which compo&s;e the whole &s;ce|nery through both the&s;e promontories, are in general, oak.</P>
<P>From hence through lanes of the &s;ame kind, though le&s;s &s;uperbly decorated, we came to the village of Patterdale; &s;ituated on ri&s;ing grounds, among two or three little
<PB N="64" REF="67">
rivers, or branches of a river, which feed the lake. It lies in a cove of mountains, open in front to the &s;outhern reach of the lake; beyond which appear the high and woody lands of Gobray-park. The &s;ituation is magnificent.</P>
<P>Among the cottages of this village, there is a hou&s;e, belonging to a per&s;on of &s;ome|what better condition; who&s;e little e&s;tate, which he occupies him&s;elf, lies in the neigh|bourhood. As his property, incon&s;iderable as it is, is better than that of any of his neighbours, it has gained him the title of <HI>King of Patterdale,</HI> in which his family name is lo&s;t. His ance&s;tors have long enjoyed the title before him. We had the honour of &s;eeing this prince, as he took the diver&s;ion of fi&s;hing on the lake; and I could not help thinking, that if I were inclined to envy the &s;ituation of any potentate in Europe, it would be that of the king of Patterdale. The pride of Wind&s;or and Ver&s;ailles would &s;hrink in a compari&s;on with the magnificence of his do|minions.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="68">The great &s;implicity of this country, and that rigid temperance, and economy, which nece&s;&s;ity injoins to all it's inhabitants, may be exemplified by the following little hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>A clergyman, of the name of Matti&s;on, was mini&s;ter of this place &s;ixty years; and died lately at the age of ninety. During the early part of his life, his benefice brought him in only twelve pounds a year. It was afterwards increa&s;ed, (I &s;uppo&s;e by the queen's bounty,) to eighteen; which it never ex|ceeded. On this income he married&mdash;brought up four children&mdash;lived comfortably among his neighbours&mdash;educated a &s;on, I believe, at college&mdash;and left upwards of 1000&pound;. be|hind him.</P>
<P>With that &s;ingular &s;implicity, and inatten|tion to forms which characterize a country like this; he him&s;elf read the burial-&s;ervice over his mother; he married his father to a &s;econd wife; and afterwards buried him al&s;o. He publi&s;hed his own banns of mar|riage in the church, with a woman, whom he had formerly chri&s;tened; and him&s;elf mar|ried all his four children.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="69">From this &s;pecimen, the manners of the country may ea&s;ily be conceived. At a di&s;|tance from the refinements of the age, they are at a di&s;tance al&s;o from it's vices. Many &s;age writers, and Monte&s;quieu <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book XVIII. Ch. II.</NOTE> in particular, have &s;uppo&s;ed the&s;e rough &s;cenes of nature to have a great effect on the human mind: and have found virtues in mountainous coun|tries, which were not the growth of tamer regions. Many opinions perhaps have pa&s;&s;ed current among mankind, which have le&s;s foundation in truth. Monte&s;quieu is in que&s;t chiefly of political virtue&mdash;liberty&mdash;bravery&mdash; and the arts of bold defence: but, I believe, private virtue is equally befriended by the&s;e rough &s;cenes. It is &s;ome happine&s;s indeed to the&s;e people, that they have no great roads among them; and that their &s;imple villages, on the &s;ides of lakes, and mountains, are in no line of communication with any of the bu&s;y haunts of men. Ignorance is &s;ometimes called the mother of vice. I apprehend it to be as often the nur&s;e of innocence.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="70">Much have tho&s;e travellers to an&s;wer for, who&s;e ca&s;ual intercour&s;e with this innocent, and &s;imple people tends to corrupt them; di&s;&s;eminating among them ideas of extrava|gance, and di&s;&s;ipation&mdash;giving them a ta&s;te for plea&s;ures, and gratifications, of which they had no ideas&mdash;in&s;piring them with di&s;|content at home&mdash;and tainting their rough, indu&s;trious manners with idlene&s;s, and a thir&s;t after di&s;hone&s;t means.</P>
<P>If travellers would frequent this country with a view to examine it's grandeur, and beauty&mdash;or to explore it's varied, and curious regions with the eye of philo&s;ophy&mdash;or, if that could be hoped, to adore the great Crea|tor in the&s;e his &s;ublimer works&mdash;if, in their pa&s;&s;age through it, they could be content with &s;uch fare as the country produces; or, at lea&s;t reconcile them&s;elves to it by manly exerci&s;e, and fatigue (for there is a time, when the &s;tomach, and the plaine&s;t food will be found in perfect harmony)&mdash;if they could thus, in&s;tead of corrupting the manners of an innocent people; learn to amend their own,
<PB N="68" REF="71">
by &s;eeing in how narrow a compa&s;s the wants of human life may be compre&s;&s;ed&mdash;a journey through the&s;e wild &s;cenes might be attended perhaps with more improvement, than a jour|ney to Rome, or Paris. Where manners are poli&s;hed into vicious refinement, &s;implifying is the be&s;t mode of improving; and the ex|ample of innocence is a more in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on, than any that can be taught by arti&s;ts, and literati.</P>
<P>But the&s;e &s;cenes are too often the re&s;ort of gay company, who are under no impre&s;&s;ions of this kind&mdash;who have no ideas, but of ex|tending the &s;phere of their amu&s;ements&mdash;or, of varying a life of di&s;&s;ipation. The grandeur of the country is not taken into the que&s;|tion: or, at lea&s;t it is no otherwi&s;e con&s;idered, than as affording &s;ome new mode of plea|&s;urable enjoyment. Thus even the diver&s;ions of Newmarket are introduced&mdash;diver&s;ions, one would imagine, more foreign to the na|ture of this country, than any other. A number of hor&s;es are carried into the middle of a lake in a flat boat. A plug is drawn from the bottom: the boat &s;inks, and the hor&s;es are left floating on the &s;urface. In dif|ferent

<P>HAVING &s;pent two hours at Patterdale, in refre&s;hing our hor&s;es, and in &s;urvey|ing the beauty of it's &s;ituation; we left it with regret, and &s;et out for Penrith.</P>
<P>We had now the whole length of the lake to &s;kirt; part of which we had already tra|ver&s;ed in our rout from Gobray-park: but we felt no reluctance at taking a &s;econd view of it.</P>
<P>As we traver&s;ed the two woody promon|tories, which we had pa&s;&s;ed in the morning, we had a grand exhibition of the middle reach of the lake; which, I have ob&s;erved, is by far the longe&s;t. Martindale-fell, &s;hooting into the water, which before adorned the left
<PB N="72" REF="74">
of the land&s;cape, now took it's &s;tation on the right. The left was compo&s;ed of the high woody grounds about Gobray-park.&mdash;In the center, the hills gently declining, formed a boundary at the bottom of the lake; &s;tretching far to the ea&s;t.&mdash;As a fore-ground, we had the woods, and rocks of the two promontories, through which we pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Such were the outlines, and compo&s;ition of the view before us; but it's colouring was &s;till more exqui&s;ite.</P>
<P>The &s;un was now de&s;cending low, and ca&s;t the broad &s;hades of evening athwart the land|&s;cape: while his beams, gleaming with yellow lu&s;tre through the vallies, &s;pread over the inlightened &s;ummits of the mountains, a thou|&s;and lovely tints&mdash;in &s;ober harmony, where &s;ome deep rece&s;s was faintly &s;hadowed&mdash;in &s;plendid hue, where jutting knolls, or pro|montories received the fuller radiance of the diverging ray. The air was &s;till: the lake, one va&s;t expan&s;e of cry&s;tal mirror. The mountain-&s;hadows, which &s;ometimes give the water a deep, black hue (in many circum&s;tan|ces, extremely picture&s;que;) were &s;oftened here
<PB N="73" REF="75">
into a mild, blue tint, which &s;wept over half the &s;urface. The other half received the fair impre&s;&s;ion of every radiant form, that glowed around. The inverted land&s;cape was touched in fainter colours, than the real one. Yet it it was more than <HI>laid in.</HI> It was almo&s;t fini&s;hed. The la&s;t touches alone were want|ing.</P>
<P>What an admirable &s;tudy for the pallet is &s;uch a &s;cene as this! infinitely beyond the camera's contracted bounds. Here you &s;ee nature in her full dimen&s;ions. You are let into the very my&s;tery&mdash;into every artifice, of her pencil. In the <HI>reflected picture,</HI> you &s;ee the <HI>ground &s;he lays in</HI>&mdash;the great effects pre|&s;erved&mdash;and that veil of expre&s;&s;ive ob&s;curity thrown over all, in which what is done, is done &s;o exqui&s;itely, that if you wi&s;h the <HI>fini&s;h|ing touches,</HI> you wi&s;h them only by the &s;ame inimitable hand that gave the &s;ketch. Turn from the &s;hadow to the reality, and you have them. There the ob&s;curity is detailed. The picture, and the &s;ketch reflect mutual graces on each other.</P>
<P>I dwell the longer on this &s;cene, becau&s;e during five days, which we &s;pent in this ro|mantic country, where we took a view of &s;o
<PB N="74" REF="76">
many lakes, this was the only moment, in which we were &s;o fortunate, as to &s;ee the water in a <HI>pure,</HI> reflecting &s;tate. Partial ex|hibitions of this kind we had often met with: but here we were pre&s;ented with a &s;cene of the utmo&s;t magnificence.</P>
<P>Having examined this very lovely land&s;cape, &s;o perfect both in compo&s;ition, and in colour|ing, we proceeded in our rout along the lake.</P>
<P>We now re-entered Gobray-park; which afforded us, for near three miles, a great va|riety of beautiful &s;cenes on the left, compo&s;ed of rocky, and broken-ground, fore&s;t-trees, cop&s;e-wood, and wooded-hills: while the lake, and mountains, who&s;e &s;ummits were now glowing with the full &s;plendor of an evening &s;un, were a continued fund of varied entertainment on the right. The eye was both amu&s;ed, and relieved by &s;urveying the two different modes of &s;cenery in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: the broad &s;hades, and bright diver&s;ified tints, of the di&s;tant mountains, on one &s;ide; and the beautiful forms, and objects of the fore-ground, on the other.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">One part of the fore-ground was marked with &s;ingular wildne&s;s. It was a kind of rocky pa&s;s near the margin of the lake; known, I believe, by the name of <HI>Yew-cragg.</HI> If Cae&s;ar had &s;een it, it would have &s;truck him in a military light; and he would have de&s;cribed it as a defile, "angu&s;tum, &amp; dif|ficile, inter montem, &amp; lacum; quo vix &s;inguli carri ducerentur. Mons alti&s;&s;imus impendebat; ut facile perpauci tran&s;itum pro|hibere po&s;&s;ent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;. Com. lib. 1.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>But our imaginations were more amu&s;ed with picture&s;que, than military ideas. It &s;truck us therefore merely as an object of beauty.&mdash;It's features were the&s;e.</P>
<P>At a little di&s;tance from the lake, the broken &s;ide of a mountain falls abruptly to the ground in two noble tiers of rock; both which are &s;hattered in every direction. This rocky &s;cene was ornamented in the riche&s;t manner with wood. The road &s;kirted the lake; and between it and the rocks, all was rough, broken-ground, intangled with brakes, and impa&s;&s;ible. Among the rocks aro&s;e a grove of fore&s;t-trees
<PB N="76" REF="78">
of various height, according to the inequality of the ground. Here and there, a few &s;cat|tered oaks, the fathers of the fore&s;t, reared their peeled, and withered trunks acro&s;s the glade; and &s;et off the vivid green of the more luxuriant trees. The deer &s;tarting from the brakes, as the feet of our hor&s;es approached, added new wildne&s;s to the native character of the view; while the &s;creams of a hernery (the wilde&s;t notes in nature) allowed the ear to participate in the &s;cene.</P>
<P>The illumination of this grand ma&s;s of rock was as intere&s;ting, as the compo&s;ition of it. It was over&s;pread, when we &s;aw it, with a deep evening-&s;hadow, with many a darker tint in the clo&s;er rece&s;&s;es. A mild ray, ju&s;t tinged with the blu&s;h of a &s;etting &s;un, tipped the &s;ummits of the trees:
<Q><L>While, ru&s;hing through the branches, rifted cliffs</L>
<L>Dart their <HI>white</HI> heads, and <HI>glitter</HI> through the <HI>gloom.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Were a man di&s;po&s;ed to turn hermit, I know not where he could fix his abode more agree|ably than here. The projecting rocks would
<PB N="77" REF="79">
afford a &s;heltered &s;ituation for his cell; which would open to a &s;cene every way fitted for meditation. He might wander along the bot|tom of a mountain; and by the &s;ide of a lake, almo&s;t unfrequented, except by the foot of curio&s;ity, or of &s;ome ha&s;ty &s;hepherd, &s;eeking for the &s;tragglers of his flock. Here he might enjoy the contemplation of nature in all her &s;implicity and grandeur. This &s;ingle &s;cene, the mere invirons of his cell, under all the varieties of light, and &s;hade&mdash;&s;un-&s;hine, and &s;torm&mdash;morning, and evening, would it&s;elf afford an inexhau&s;ted fund of entertainment: while the ample tome expanded daily before his eye, would bani&s;h the littlene&s;s of life; and naturally impre&s;s his mind with great ideas.</P>
<P>From this wild &s;cene we &s;oon entered ano|ther of a different ca&s;t. It was a circular plain, about half a mile in diameter; &s;ur|rounded by mountains, with an opening to the lake. The plain was &s;mooth, but varied: the mountains, rather low, but rugged.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="80">A valley, like this, con&s;idered as a <HI>whole,</HI> has little picture&s;que beauty. But a pictu|re&s;que eye will find it's objects even here. It will inve&s;tigate the hills, and pick out &s;uch portions, as are mo&s;t plea&s;ing. The&s;e it will form into back-grounds, and inrich the fore-ground (which can only be a plain) with cattle, trees, or other objects.&mdash;Even &s;uch &s;imple &s;cenes, by the aid of judicious lights, may form pictures.</P>
<P>We had the &s;ame kind of &s;cene, &s;oon after, repeated,&mdash;a circular valley, &s;urrounded with mountains, tho varied in many particulars from the other. Both however were equally unadorned; and as both were capable, by a few well-cho&s;en accompaniments, of being formed into good pictures; &s;o likewi&s;e both were capable of being made delightful &s;cenes in nature, by a little judicious planting; tho we mu&s;t &s;till have wi&s;hed this planting to have had the growth of a century.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81">It is remarkable, that we find &s;carce any di&s;po&s;ition of ground, that belongs to a moun|tainous country, of which Virgil has not taken notice. The &s;cenes we now examined, he exactly de&s;cribes: only he has given his hills the ornament of wood, which he knew was their mo&s;t picture&s;que dre&s;s.</P>

<P>Not far from the&s;e circular plains appears <HI>Gobray-hall;</HI> once the capital of the&s;e do|mains; but now a neglected man&s;ion. If &s;ituation can recommend a place, this &s;eems to enjoy one in great perfection. It &s;tands on high ground, with higher &s;till behind it. We did not ride up to the hou&s;e; but it &s;eemed to command a noble view of the lake, and of the &s;cenery around it.</P>
<P>Nearly at the point where Ulle&s;water makes it's la&s;t curve, &s;tands the village of <HI>Water-Mullock;</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="82">
&s;ituated rather within the land. Through this place the road carried us to the la&s;t reach of the lake; which is the lea&s;t beautiful part. Here the hills grow &s;mooth, and lumpi&s;h; and the country, at every &s;tep, lo&s;es &s;ome of the wild &s;trokes of nature; and degenerates, if I may &s;o &s;peak, into cultiva|tion.</P>
<P>At the end of the lake &s;tands <HI>Dunmallet,</HI> a remarkable hill, which overlooks the la&s;t reach; but is it&s;elf rather a di&s;gu&s;ting object. Shaped with conic exactne&s;s; planted uni|formly with Scotch firs; and cut as uniformly into walks verging to a center, it becomes a vile termination of a noble &s;cene.&mdash;Once probably it was more intere&s;ting; when the Roman eagle was planted, as it formerly was, upon it's &s;ummit&mdash;when it's bold, rough &s;ides were in uni&s;on with the objects around&mdash;and a noble ca&s;tle frowned, from it's precipices over the lake. This fortre&s;s, who&s;e ram|parts may yet ea&s;ily be traced, mu&s;t once have been of con&s;iderable importance, as it commanded all the avenues of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83">We had now fini&s;hed our view of Ulle&s;|water, which contains a wonderful variety of grand, and picture&s;que &s;cenes, compre&s;&s;ed within a very narrow compa&s;s.&mdash;In one part, not far from Water-Mullock, the road carried us to the higher grounds, from whence we had a view of the whole lake, and all it's va&s;t accompaniments together&mdash;a troubled &s;ea of mountains; a broken &s;cene&mdash;amu&s;ing, but not picture&s;que.</P>
<P>In our evening's ride, we had &s;kirted only one &s;ide of the lake; and wi&s;hed our time would have allowed us to &s;kirt the other al&s;o. It is probable the &s;outhern coa&s;t might have afforded very noble di&s;tant views of the woods, and rocks of Gobray-park, and the adjacent lofty grounds.</P>
<P>We could have wi&s;hed al&s;o to have navi|gated the lake: for though views from the <HI>water,</HI> are in general le&s;s beautiful, than the &s;ame views from the <HI>land,</HI> as they want the
<PB N="82" REF="84">
advantage of a fore-ground, and al&s;o bring the horizon too low<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Page 96.</NOTE>; yet it is probable the grand reaches of this lake, and the woody promontories, round which the water winds, would have di&s;played many beautiful pa&s;&s;ages from a boat.</P>
<P>One view from the water, we heard much commended, that of the la&s;t reach of the lake, towards the conic hill of Dunmallet. The &s;ides of the lake&mdash;it's gliding away into the river Eamot, which carries it off&mdash;Pooly-bridge, which is thrown over that river, at the bottom of the lake&mdash;and the country beyond&mdash;were all much extolled: but we could not conceive, that any views, at this end of the lake, could be comparable to what we had &s;een near the &s;hores of Patterdale: e&s;pecially any views, in which the regular form of Dunmallet made &s;o con&s;iderable a part.</P>
<P>It would have added al&s;o to our amu&s;ement, to have taken a view of the lake by moon|light.
<PB N="83" REF="85">
For tho it is very difficult <HI>in painting</HI> to manage &s;o feeble an effu&s;ion of light in &s;uch a manner, as, at the &s;ame time, to <HI>illumine objects,</HI> and <HI>produce an effect;</HI> yet the <HI>reality,</HI> in &s;uch &s;cenes as the&s;e, is attended often with a wonderful &s;olemnity and grandeur.

<P>I cannot leave the &s;cenes of Ulle&s;water, without taking notice of an uncommon fi&s;h, which frequents it's waters; and which is equally the object of the naturali&s;t, and of the epicure. It is of the trout-&s;pecies; beau|tifully clad in &s;cales of &s;ilver; firm, and finely
<PB N="84" REF="86">
flavoured; and of &s;uch dimen&s;ions, that it has &s;ometimes been known to weigh between thirty, and forty pounds.</P>
<P>Having now pa&s;t the limits of the lake, we traver&s;ed a very plea&s;ant country in our road to Penrith, keeping the Eamot com|monly within view on our right; and leaving on the left, the ruins of Dacre-ca&s;tle, the ancient &s;eat of the noble family of that name.</P>
<P>No part of Cumberland is more inhabited by the genteeler families of the county, than this. Within the circumference of a few miles &s;tand many of their hou&s;es; &s;ome of which have formerly been ca&s;tles: but the road carried us in view only of two or three of them.</P>
<P>Before we arrived at Penrith, one of the&s;e fortre&s;&s;es, which is known by the name of Penrith-ca&s;tle, pre&s;ented us with a very noble ruin; and under the mo&s;t intere&s;ting circum|&s;tances. The &s;un, which, through the length

of a &s;ummer-day, had befriended us with all his morning, noon, and evening powers; preparing now, with <HI>farewell &s;weet,</HI> to take his leave, gave us yet one more beautiful exhibition.</P>
<P>A grand broken arch pre&s;ented it&s;elf fir&s;t in deep &s;hadow. Through the aperture ap|peared a part of the internal &s;tructure, thrown into per&s;pective to great advantage; and illu|mined by the departing ray. Other fragments of the &s;hattered towers, and battlements were ju&s;t touched with the &s;plendid tint: but the body of light re&s;ted on tho&s;e parts, which were &s;een through the &s;hadowed arch.</P>
<P>In the offskip, beyond the ca&s;tle, aro&s;e a hill, in &s;hadow likewi&s;e; on the top of which &s;tood a lonely beacon. The windows an&s;wer|ing each other, we could ju&s;t di&s;cern the glowing horizon through them&mdash;a circum|&s;tance, which however trivial in de&s;cription, has a beautiful effect in land&s;cape.</P>
<P>This beacon is a monument of tho&s;e tumul|tuous times, which preceded the union; and the only monument of the kind now remain|ing in the&s;e parts; though &s;uch beacons were formerly &s;tationed over the whole country;
<PB N="86" REF="89">
and could &s;pread intelligence, in a few &s;econds, from one end of it to the other.</P>
<P>At this later day the&s;e ca&s;tles and po&s;ts of alarm, adorning the country, they once defended, rai&s;e plea&s;ing reflections on a com|pari&s;on of pre&s;ent times with pa&s;t&mdash;tho&s;e tur|bulent times, when no man could &s;leep in &s;afety unle&s;s &s;ecured by a fortre&s;s. In war he feared the inva&s;ion of an open enemy: and in peace a mi&s;chief &s;till more formidable, the ravages of banditti; with whom the country was always at that time infe&s;ted. The&s;e wretches were compo&s;ed of the outlaws from both nations; and inhabiting the fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of the bogs, and mountains, u&s;ed to &s;ally out, and plunder in all directions.</P>
<P>Penrith is a neat town, &s;ituated not un|plea&s;antly, under mountains; and in the neigh|bourhood of lakes.</P>
<P>In the church-yard we &s;aw an ancient mo|nument, which has occa&s;ioned much &s;pecu|lation among antiquarians. It con&s;i&s;ts of two rough pillars, with four &s;emicircular &s;tones, fixed in the ground between them. Dr. Todd, an antiquarian of the la&s;t age, found out four
<PB N="87" REF="90">
wild-boars, and other ingenious devices, on the different parts of this monument. We examined it with attention: but could not find even the mo&s;t di&s;tant re&s;emblance of any form in nature. The whole &s;urface &s;eemed to be nothing more than a piece of rough chi&s;&s;el work.&mdash;In the church, which is a hand&s;ome, plain &s;tructure, is placed a &s;tone, recording the ravages of the plague among the &s;everal towns of this neighbourhood, in the year 1598.</P>
<P>As we leave Penrith, which is within twenty miles of Carli&s;le, we enter that va&s;t wa&s;te, called <HI>Inglewood-fore&s;t,</HI> through which we rode at lea&s;t nine miles; in all which &s;pace there is &s;carce a tree to be &s;een: and yet were it well planted, as it once probably was, many parts of it might be admired: for the ground makes bold and noble &s;wells; the back &s;cenery is compo&s;ed of a grand &s;weep of mountains; and on the left, are di&s;|tant views into a cultivated country.</P>
<P>The mountains, which adorn the&s;e &s;cenes, are the &s;ame we &s;aw, as we left Ke&s;wick; only the more northern part of that circular
<PB N="88" REF="91">
chain is now turned towards us. In this view, the ridge of Saddle-back a&s;&s;umes that &s;hape, from which it derives it's appellation.</P>
<P>That part of Inglewood-fore&s;t, which lies neare&s;t the town, is known by the name of Penrith-fell, con&s;i&s;ting of rough, and hilly grounds. One of the highe&s;t hills is occu|pied by the beacon, of which we had a di&s;|tant view, as we examined the ruins of Pen|rith-ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>On this &s;pot, in the year 1715, the Cum|berland militia a&s;&s;embled to oppo&s;e the re|bels in their march to the &s;outh. But a mi|litia without di&s;cipline, is never formidable. The whole body fled, as the van of the re|bels appeared marching round an oppo&s;ite hill.</P>
<P>Nicol&s;on, bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, a &s;trenuous man, who had been very in&s;trumental in bringing them together, and now attended their march; was &s;o chagrined, and mortified at their behaviour, that in a fit of ob&s;tinate vexation, he would not quit the field. The
<PB N="89" REF="92">
enemy was coming on apace. His &s;ervants rode up to the coach for orders. The bi&s;hop &s;at mute with indignation. All thoughts of him&s;elf were lo&s;t in the public di&s;grace. His coachman however, who&s;e feelings were le&s;s delicate, thinking the management of affairs, in this interruption of government, now de|volved upon him, la&s;hed his hor&s;es, and car|ried his ma&s;ter off the field.</P>
<P>On the verge of the fore&s;t, at a place called Plumpton, a large Roman &s;tation (or &s;tative camp) runs a quarter of a mile, on the right. You trace the ground broken variou&s;ly, where tents, kitchens, and earthen tables probably &s;tood, not unlike the ve&s;tiges of a modern encampment. On the left appear the lines of a fort of con&s;iderable dimen&s;ions, about one hundred and fifty yards &s;quare, which was once the citadel of this military colony. The ramparts, and ditches may ea&s;ily be traced on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>The great road indeed, which we travelled, is intirely Roman; and is laid almo&s;t by a line over the fore&s;t. You &s;eldom &s;ee a <HI>winding</HI> road of Roman con&s;truction. Their &s;urvey|ors,
<PB N="90" REF="93">
and pioneers had no idea of the line of beauty; nor &s;tood in reverence of any inclo|&s;ures; but always took the &s;horte&s;t cut; making the Appian way the model of all their provincial roads.</P>
<P>At Ragmire, about a mile farther, where the road cro&s;&s;es a bog, large wooden frame|works, yet uninjured by time, were lately dug up; which the Romans had laid, as a foundation for their cau&s;ey, over that un|&s;table &s;urface.</P>
<P>On leaving Inglewood-fore&s;t, the road en|ters an enclo&s;ed country, in which is little variety, and &s;carce an intere&s;ting object, till we arrive at Carli&s;le.</P>
<P>The approach to that city, from the ri&s;ing ground, near the little village of Hereby, is grand. The town, which terminates a vi&s;ta of a mile in length, takes a very compact form; in which no part is &s;een, but what makes a hand&s;ome appearance. The &s;quare, and ma&s;&s;y tower of the ca&s;tle ri&s;es on the right: in the middle, the cathedral ri&s;es &s;till
<PB N="91" REF="94">
higher; and contiguous to it, on the left, appear the round towers of the citadel; which was built by Henry VIII, in the form of all his ca&s;tles on the Hamp&s;hire, and Kenti&s;h coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>The beauty however of this approach is &s;oon lo&s;t. As we de&s;cend the hill from Hereby, the town &s;inks into the in&s;ignificance of it's invirons.</P>
<P>The entrance is &s;till beautiful; the road winding to the gate round the towers of the citadel.</P>

<P>FEW towns offer a fairer field to an anti|quary, than Carli&s;le. It's origin, and hi&s;tory, are remote, curious and ob&s;cure. It was unque&s;tionably a place of con&s;equence in Roman times. Severus's wall ju&s;t includes it in the Briti&s;h pale. The ve&s;tiges of that barrier run within half a mile of it's gates; and it probably figured fir&s;t under the charac|ter of a fortre&s;s, on that celebrated rampart.</P>
<P>In after ages it had it's &s;hare &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the hi&s;tory of Saxons, Danes, and Scots; and during the revolutions of the&s;e &s;everal nations, was the &s;cene of every vici&s;&s;itude of war. It hath been frequently be&s;ieged, pil|laged, burnt, and rebuilt. Once it lay buried in it's ruins for the &s;pace of two centuries. Rufus brought it again into exi&s;tence. The pre&s;ent town is founded on the ve&s;tiges of
<PB N="94" REF="96">
former towns; which in many parts have rai&s;ed the ground within, nearly to the height of the walls. The foundations of a hou&s;e are rarely dug without di&s;turbing the ruins of &s;ome other hou&s;e. It has been the re&s;idence; and it has been the pri&s;on of kings. An old a&s;h|tree is &s;till &s;hewn, near the gate of the ca&s;tle; which is &s;aid to have been planted by the unfortunate Mary of Scotland, who &s;pent a part of her captivity in this fortre&s;s; whither &s;he was &s;oon brought, after her landing at Workington. Many princes al&s;o have &s;hed their royal favours on this ancient town; and made it's fortifications their care.</P>
<P>Now all it's military honours are di&s;graced. Northern commotions are no longer dreaded. It's gates &s;tand always open; and it's walls, the object of no farther attention, are falling fa&s;t into ruin. The firing of a morning and an evening gun from the ca&s;tle, which was the la&s;t garri&s;on-form that remained, hath been di&s;continued the&s;e &s;ix years, to the great regret of the country around, who&s;e hours of labour it regulated.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="97">But I mean not to enter into the hi&s;tory of Carli&s;le: it concerns me only as an object of beauty. Within it's walls indeed it contains little that de&s;erves notice. The ca&s;tle is heavy in all it's parts, as the&s;e fabrics commonly are. It is too perfect to afford much plea&s;ure to the picture&s;que eye; except as a remote object, &s;oftened by di&s;tance. Hereafter, when it's &s;hattered towers, and buttre&s;&s;es, give a light|ne&s;s to it's parts, it may adorn &s;ome future land&s;cape.</P>
<P>The cathedral de&s;erves &s;till le&s;s attention. It is a heavy, Saxon pile; and there is nothing about it, that is beautiful; except the ea&s;t-window, which is a rich, and very elegant piece of Gothic ramification.</P>
<P>The <HI>fratry,</HI> as it is called, or chapter-hou&s;e, in the abbey, is the only building that de|&s;erves notice. On one &s;ide, where it has formerly been connected with the cloy&s;ters, it has little beauty: but on the other, next the deanery, it's proportions and ornaments are elegant. It &s;eems to be of that &s;tyle of archi|tecture, which prevailed rather before the two later Henries.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98">But though Carli&s;le furni&s;hes little amu&s;e|ment within it's walls; yet it adds great beauty, as a di&s;tant object, to the country around. Few towns enjoy a better &s;ituation. It &s;tands on a ri&s;ing ground, in the mid&s;t of meadows, watered by two con&s;iderable rivers; which flowing on different &s;ides of the city, unite a little below it; and form the whole ground-plot, on which it &s;tands, into a kind of penin&s;ula. Beyond the meadows, the ground ri&s;es, in almo&s;t all parts, at different di&s;tances.</P>
<P>The meadows around it, e&s;pecially along the banks of the river Eden, want only a little more wood to make them very beautiful. In high floods, which happen two or three times in the cour&s;e of a winter, they exhibit a very grand &s;cene. The town appears &s;tand|ing out, like a promontory in the mid&s;t of a va&s;t lake.</P>
<P>The &s;hort &s;iege which Carli&s;le &s;u&s;tained in the rebellion of the year 1745, together with &s;ome awkward circum&s;tances that attended it, threw
<PB N="97" REF="99">
a general odium upon the town; and many be|lieved, among whom was the late duke of Cum|berland, that it was very ill-affected to the go|vernment. No &s;u&s;picion was ever more unju&s;t. I dare take upon me to &s;ay, there were &s;carce half a dozen people in the whole place, who wi&s;hed well to the rebellion.</P>
<P>The following anecdote, known but to few; and totally unknown, till many years after the event, will throw &s;ome light on it's ha&s;ty &s;urrender; which brought it into &s;uch di&s;|grace.</P>
<P>When the rebels came before it, it was garri&s;oned only by two companies of invalids; and two raw, undi&s;ciplined regiments of mi|litia. General Wade lay at Newca&s;tle with a con&s;iderable force: and the governor of Carli&s;le informing him, how unprovided he was, begged a reinforcement. The &s;ingle hope of this relief, enabled the gentlemen of the country, who commanded the militia, to keep their men under arms.</P>
<P>In the mean time the rebels were known to be as ill-prepared for an attack, as the town was for a defence. They had now lain a week before it; and found it was impracticable, for
<PB N="98" REF="100">
want of artillery, to make any attempt. They feared al&s;o an interruption from general Wade: and be&s;ides, were unwilling to delay any longer their march towards London. Under the&s;e difficulties, they had come to a re&s;olution to abandon their de&s;ign.</P>
<P>At this critical time the governor of Carli&s;le received a letter from general Wade, informing him, he was &s;o circum&s;tanced, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;end the reinforcement that had been de&s;ired. This mortifying intelligence, tho not publickly known, was however communicated to the principal officers; and to &s;ome others; among whom was a bu&s;y at|torney, who&s;e name was H&mdash;s.</P>
<P>H&mdash;s was then addre&s;&s;ing a young lady, the daughter of Mr. F&mdash;r, a gentleman of the country; and to a&s;&s;i&s;t his cau&s;e, and give him&s;elf con&s;equence with his intended father in law, he whi&s;pered to him, among his other political &s;ecrets, the di&s;appointment from ge|neral Wade.</P>
<P>The whi&s;per did not re&s;t here. F&mdash;r frequented a club in the neighbourhood; where ob&s;erving (in the jollity of a chearful evening) that only friends were pre&s;ent, he gave his company the information, he had ju&s;t received from H&mdash;s.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="101">There was in that company, one S&mdash;d, a gentleman of &s;ome fortune near Carli&s;le, who, tho a known papi&s;t, was however at that time, thought to be of very intire affection to the government. This man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a &s;ecret, and wi&s;hing for an opportunity to &s;erve a cau&s;e, which he favoured in his heart, took hor&s;e that very night, after he left the club-room, and rode directly to the rebel-camp; which he found under orders to break up the next morning. He was carried imme|diately to the Duke of Perth, and others of the rebel leaders, to whom he communicated his intelligence; and a&s;&s;ured them, they might expect a mutiny in the town, if they conti|nued before it, one day longer. Counter orders were immediately i&s;&s;ued; and the next day the Cumberland and We&s;tmoreland militia, being under no di&s;cipline, began to mutiny, and di&s;|per&s;e; and the town defended now only by two companies of invalids, was thought no longer tenable. The governor was tried by a court-martial; and acquitted: and nobody &s;uppo&s;ed that either the militia-officers, or their men, were impre&s;&s;ed by any motive wor&s;e than fear.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="102">In &s;o variegated a country, as England, there are few parts, which do not afford many plea&s;ing, and picture&s;que &s;cenes. The mo&s;t probable way of finding them, as I ob&s;erved a little above, is to follow the cour&s;e of the rivers. About their banks we &s;hall generally find the riche&s;t &s;cenery, which the country can produce. This rule we followed in the few excur&s;ions which we had time to make from Carli&s;le: and fir&s;t we took a view of the river Cauda.</P>
<P>Near the town this river is broken into &s;o many &s;treams; and throws up, every where, &s;o many barren beds of pebbles, that there is no great beauty in this part of it's cour&s;e. But above, where higher banks confine it's impetu|o&s;ity, it becomes more intere&s;ting. The vales of Sebergham and Dal&s;ton, we heard much commended. The former we did not vi&s;it&punc; the latter we followed with great plea&s;ure, along it's winding cour&s;e, for many miles; and found our&s;elves often in the mid&s;t of very beau|tiful &s;cenes; the river being &s;hut up &s;ometimes
<PB N="101" REF="103">
by clo&s;e, and lofty banks, and &s;ometimes flow|ing through meadows edged with wood.</P>
<P>Among other &s;ituations on the Cauda we were much plea&s;ed with that of Ro&s;e-ca&s;tle, the &s;eat of the bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le; which &s;tands on a gentle ri&s;e, in a wide part of the vale; the river winding round it, in a &s;emi-circular form, at about half a mile's di&s;tance. The ground between the ca&s;tle, and the river, con|&s;i&s;ts of beautiful meadows; and beyond the river, the lofty bank, which winds with it, is well-planted; and forms a &s;weep of hanging wood. The ca&s;tle compo&s;ed of &s;quare towers, tho no object on the &s;pot, is a good orna|ment to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>Between Ro&s;e-ca&s;tle and Wigton the coun|try abounds with the relicks of Roman in|campments. At a place, called Chalk-cliff (which, by the way, is a cliff of red &s;tone) this legionary in&s;cription is engraved in the native rock.</P>

<P><PB N="102" REF="104">From the Cauda, our next excur&s;ion was along the Eden. On the banks of this river, we were informed of many intere&s;ting &s;cenes. At Kirko&s;wal, and Nunnery particularly, the country was repre&s;ented as very engaging; but Corby-ca&s;tle, about five miles from Carli&s;le, was the only place above the town, which we had time to vi&s;it.</P>
<P>At Wetherall we ferried over the river; and landed under the ca&s;tle, which &s;tands on the edge of a lofty bank. This bank &s;tretches at lea&s;t three miles along the cour&s;e of the river, partly below, but chiefly above, the ca&s;tle. I give it it's ancient title; tho it is now a mere modern hou&s;e, without the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of it's primeval dignity. Below the ca&s;tle, the bank is rocky, and falls precipitately into the water: above, it makes a more gentle de&s;cent; and leaves an edging, which, in &s;ome parts, &s;preads into little winding meads, and where it is nar|rowe&s;t, is broad enough for a hand&s;ome walk. The whole bank, both above, and below the ca&s;tle, is covered with wood; large oak, and a&s;h; and in many places the &s;cenery is rocky al&s;o. But the rocks are not of the grey kind,
<PB N="103" REF="105">
&s;tained with a variety of different tints&mdash;the <HI>&s;axa circumlita mu&s;co;</HI> but incline rather to a &s;andy red, which is not the mo&s;t coale&s;cing hue. They give however great &s;pirit, and beauty to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>The bank of the river, <HI>oppo&s;ite</HI> to the ca&s;tle, is likewi&s;e high; in many parts woody; in others affording an intermixture of wood, and lawn. Here &s;tand the ruins of Wetherall-abbey; tho little more of it is left, than a &s;quare tower, which is &s;ome ornament, tho no very picture&s;que one, to the &s;cene. The&s;e ruins were once exten&s;ive, and, I have heard, beau|tiful; but the dean and chapter of Carli&s;le, to whom the place belongs, &s;ome years ago car|ried off the &s;tones, with more oeconomy than ta&s;te, to build a prebendal hou&s;e.</P>
<P>On this &s;ide of the river al&s;o, an object pre&s;ents it&s;elf, known by the name of <HI>Wetherall-&s;afeguard,</HI> which is e&s;teemed a great curio&s;ity. It con&s;i&s;ts of three chambers cut in the &s;olid rock, which being in this part, almo&s;t a pre|cipice, the acce&s;s to the&s;e chambers is very difficult. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been an ap|pendage of the abbey; where the monks, in times of di&s;order, &s;ecreted their wealth. Some antiquarians &s;uppo&s;e it to have been
<PB N="104" REF="106">
inhabited by a religious devotee, and call it <HI>St. Con&s;tantine's cell.</HI> It is rather a curious place, than any great ornament to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>To the natural advantages of the &s;cenery about Corby-ca&s;tle, the improvements of art have added little. The late proprietor, who had &s;een nothing him&s;elf; and imagined from the re&s;ort of &s;trangers to &s;ee the beauty of his &s;ituation, that they admired his ta&s;te, re&s;olved to make Corby one of the mo&s;t &s;umptuous places in Europe. With this view, he &s;cooped his rocks into grottos&mdash;fabricated a ca&s;cade, con&s;i&s;ting of a lofty flight of regular &s;tone &s;teps &mdash;cut a &s;traight walk through his woods, along the banks of the river; at the end of which he reared a temple: and being re&s;olved to add every ornament, that expence could procure, he hired an arti&s;t of the country, at four-pence a day (for labour was then cheap) to make &s;tatues. Numberle&s;s were the works of this genius. Diana, Neptune, Polyphemus, Nymphs and Satyrs in abundance, and a variety of other figures, became &s;oon the ornaments of the woods; and met the eye of the &s;pectator wherever he turned. A pun&s;ter, who was re|markable for making only one good pun in his life, made it here. Pointing to one of the&s;e
<PB N="105" REF="107">
&s;trange figures, he called it <HI>a &s;atyr upon the place.</HI></P>
<P>But the ta&s;te of the pre&s;ent age hath de&s;troyed the pride of the la&s;t. The pre&s;ent proprietor hath done little; but what he hath done, is done well. The rocks indeed &s;cooped into holes, can never be re&s;tored to their native &s;implicity, and grandeur. Their bold projec|tions are for ever effaced. Nor could a century re&s;tore tho&s;e trees which were rooted up to form the vi&s;ta. But the &s;tatues, like the ancient &s;culpture of the Egyptians, are now no more. The temple is going fa&s;t into ruins; and the ca&s;cade (&s;o frivolous, if it had even been good in it's kind, on the banks of a great, and rapid river) is now overgrown with thic|kets. The old line of the walk could not ea&s;ily be effaced: but a new one, beyond the temple, is carried on, which follows naturally the cour&s;e of the river. And indeed this part of the walk admits more beauty, than any other; for the varieties of ground are greater; the bank, and edging of meadow, are more irregular; and the river more &s;inuous.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="108">The path having conducted us along the river, through the&s;e plea&s;ing irregulariti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> about two miles from the ca&s;tle, climbs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> higher grounds, and returns through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and beautiful &s;heep walks, which lie on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ides, and &s;ummit of the bank.</P>
<P>Through the whole of this walk, both at the top, and bottom, are many plea&s;ant views; but they are all of the more confined kind.</P>
<P>Many parts of this walk were wrought by the manual labour of the prie&s;t of the family, which is a popi&s;h branch of the Howards. He belongs to an order, which injoins it's members to work in the ground &s;o many hours a day; laying them, with admirable wi&s;dom, under the whole&s;ome nece&s;&s;ity of acquiring health and &s;pirits. I am per&s;uaded, that if a &s;tudious man were <HI>obliged</HI> to dig three or four hours a day, he would &s;tudy the better, during the remaining part of it. We had been re|commended to the civilities of this eccle&s;ia&s;tic (the family being then in France,) and found him at work in the garden. He received us politely; and di&s;covered the manners of a gen|tleman, under the garb of a day-labourer, without the lea&s;t apology for his dre&s;s, and occupation. There is &s;omething very plea&s;ing
<PB N="107" REF="109">
in the &s;implicity and manline&s;s of not being a&s;hamed of the nece&s;&s;ary functions of any &s;tate, which we have made our option in life.&mdash;This eccle&s;ia&s;tic &s;ucceeded Father Wal&s;h, who has lately engaged the attention of the public.&mdash; I have dwelt the longer on this &s;cene, as it is the mo&s;t admired one in Cumberland.</P>
<P>From Corby-ca&s;tle to Warwick, which lies about two miles nearer Carli&s;le, on the banks of the &s;ame river, the road is beautiful. Many admire the &s;ituation of Warwick al&s;o. It &s;eems to be a &s;weet, retired &s;cene; but we had not time to view it.</P>
<P>The antiquarian's eye is immediately caught here by the pari&s;h-church; the chancel of which, forming the &s;egment of a circle, and being pierced with &s;mall lancet-windows, &s;hews at once, that it is of Norman origin. Tho every other mark were obliterated, he will tell you, that this is evidence &s;ufficient of it's an|tiquity.</P>

<P>HAVING &s;een as much of the river Eden, above Carli&s;le, as our time would al|low, we made our next excur&s;ion towards it's mouth, where Brugh-mar&s;h attracted our at|tention. In our way we had many plea&s;ing river views.</P>
<P>Brugh-mar&s;h lies at the extremity of the Engli&s;h border; running up as far as Solway|frith, which, in this part, divides England from Scotland. It is a va&s;t extended plain, flat as the &s;urface of a quiet ocean. I do not remember that land, ever gave me before &s;o va&s;t an idea of &s;pace. The idea of this kind, which &s;uch &s;cenes as Sali&s;bury-Plain &s;ugge&s;ts, is much le&s;s pure. The inequality of the ground there, &s;ets bounds to the idea. It is
<PB N="110" REF="112">
the ocean in a &s;torm; in which the idea of exten&s;ion is greatly broken, and intercepted by the turbulence of the waves. Brugh-mar&s;h indeed gives us the idea of &s;olid water, rather than of land, if we except only the colour:
<Q><L>&mdash;Interminable meads,</L>
<L>And va&s;t &s;avannahs, where the wandering eye</L>
<L>Unfixt, is in a verdant ocean lo&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>Brugh-mar&s;h is one of tho&s;e extended plains, (only more exten&s;ive, than &s;uch plains com|monly are) from which the &s;ea, in a cour&s;e of ages, hath retired. It is difficult to com|pute it's limits. It ranges many leagues, in every direction, from a centre (for &s;pace &s;o diffu&s;e a&s;&s;umes of cour&s;e a circular appearance) without a hedge, or even a bu&s;h, to inter|cept it's bounds; till it &s;oftens into the azure mountains of the horizon. Nothing indeed, but mountains, can circum&s;cribe &s;uch a &s;cene. All inferior boundaries of woods, and ri&s;ing grounds are lo&s;t. On the Engli&s;h &s;ide it is bounded by that circular chain, in the heart of Cumberland, in which Skiddaw is pre|eminent. Nothing intermediate appears. On the Scotch &s;ide it's cour&s;e is interrupted, through the &s;pace of a few leagues, by Solway|frith;
<PB N="111" REF="113">
which &s;preads, when the tide is at ebb, into a va&s;t &s;tretch of &s;and. The plain however is &s;till pre&s;erved: and having pa&s;&s;ed this &s;andy ob&s;truction, it changes it's hue again into vivid green, and &s;tretches far and wide into the Scotch border, till it's progre&s;s at length is &s;topped by the mountains of Galloway, and Nidd&s;dale. This exten&s;ion is as much as the eye can well comprehend. Had the plain been boundle&s;s, like an Arabian de&s;ert, I know not whether it would not have lo&s;t that idea of &s;pace, which &s;o va&s;t a cir|cum&s;cription gives it.</P>
<P>The whole area of Brugh-mar&s;h, (which from it's <HI>denomination</HI> we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e to be &s;wampy,) is every where perfectly firm; and the turf, &s;oft, bright, and pure. Scarce a weed rears it's head. Nothing appears of &s;tatelier growth, than a mu&s;hroom, which &s;preads here in very luxuriant knots.</P>
<P>This va&s;t plain is far from being a de&s;ert wa&s;te. Innumerable herds of cattle pa&s;ture at large in it's rich verdure, and range, as in a &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="114">But tho the primary idea, which this &s;cene pre&s;ents, ari&s;es purely from &s;pace, and is therefore an idea rather grand than pictu|re&s;que; yet is it not totally incapable of pic|ture&s;que embelli&s;hment. It is true, it wants almo&s;t every ingredient of land&s;cape; on the fore-ground, it wants objects to pre&s;erve the keeping; and in the offskip, that profu&s;ion of little parts, which in a &s;cene of cultivation gives richne&s;s to di&s;tance. In treating there|fore a &s;ubject of this kind on canvas, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to adventitious objects. Cattle come mo&s;t naturally to hand; which being &s;tationed, in various groups, at different di&s;|tances, may &s;erve both as a fore-ground to the land&s;cape, and as a gage to the per&s;pective.</P>
<P>Brugh-mar&s;h is farther remarkable for having been the &s;cene of one of the greate&s;t cata&s;|trophes of the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory&mdash;the death of Edward the I. Here, after the third revolt of Scotland, that prince, drew together the mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant army, which England had ever &s;een. The Scots from their borders, &s;aw the whole plain whitened with tents: but they
<PB N="113" REF="115">
knew not how nearly their deliverance ap|proached. The greate&s;t events generally arrive unlooked for. They &s;aw a delay; and after|wards a confu&s;ion in the mighty ho&s;t before them; but they heard not, till three days after, that the &s;oul, and &s;pirit of the enter|prize was gone; and that their great adver|&s;ary lay breathle&s;s in his camp.</P>
<P>Edward had been taken ill at Carli&s;le; where he had met his parliament. But nei|ther di&s;ea&s;e, nor age (for he was now near &s;eventy) could repre&s;s his ardour. Tho he could not mount his hor&s;e, he ordered him|&s;elf to be carried in a litter to the camp; where the troops received him with accla|mations of joy. But it was &s;hort-lived. The motion had irritated his di&s;order into a vio|lent dy&s;entery; which immediately carried him off.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h borderers long revered the memory of a prince, who had &s;o often cha&s;ti&s;ed an enemy, they hated: and in gratitude reared a pillar to his name; which &s;till te&s;tifies the &s;pot, on which he died. It &s;tands rather on
<PB N="114" REF="116">
the edge of the mar&s;h, and bears this &s;imple in&s;cription.</P>
<P>MEMORIAE AETERNAE EDVARDI, REGIS ANGLIAE LONG&Egrave; CLARISSIMI, QUI, IN BELLI APPARATU CONTRA SCOTOS OCCUPATUS, HIC IN CASTRIS OBIIT, 7 JULII A. D. 1307.</P>
<P>Among other places in the neighbourhood of Carli&s;le, we made an excur&s;ion into Gills|land, with an intention chiefly to &s;ee Na|worth-ca&s;tle, the vale and ruins of the Abbey of Lanerco&s;t; and the ruins of Scaleby-ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>As we leave Carli&s;le, along the great mili|tary road to Newca&s;tle, the view of the river Eden from Stanwix-bank, is very plea&s;ing. The curve it de&s;cribes; the beautiful mea|dows it winds through; and the mountains, which clo&s;e the &s;cene, make all together a very amu&s;ing combination of objects. Wood only is wanting.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117">On cro&s;&s;ing the river Irthing, about &s;even miles from Carli&s;le, the country, which was before unplea&s;ing, becomes rich, and intere&s;t|ing. Here we enter the barony of Gill&s;land, an exten&s;ive di&s;trict, which con&s;i&s;ts, in this part, of a great variety of hill, and dale. The hills are &s;andy, bleak, and unplea&s;ant: but the vallies, which are commonly of the contracted kind, are beautiful. They are ge|nerally woody, and each of them watered by &s;ome little bu&s;y &s;tream.&mdash;From the&s;e vallies, or <HI>gills,</HI> (as the country-people call them,) with which the whole barony abounds, Camp|den &s;uppo&s;es it to have taken the name of Gill&s;land.</P>
<P>On a delightful knoll, gently gliding into a &s;inuous <HI>gill,</HI> &s;urrounded with full-grown oak, and overlooking the vale of Lanerco&s;t, &s;tands Naworth-ca&s;tle. The hou&s;e, which con&s;i&s;ts of two large &s;quare towers, united by a main body, is too regular to be beauti|ful, unle&s;s thrown into per&s;pective. It was formerly one of tho&s;e fortified places, in which
<PB N="116" REF="118">
the nobility and gentry of the borders were obliged to live, in tho&s;e times of confu&s;ion, which preceded the union. And indeed the whole internal contrivance of this ca&s;tle ap|pears calculated either to keep an enemy out; or to elude his &s;earch, if he &s;hould happen to get in. The idea of a comfortable dwell|ing has been totally excluded. The &s;tate-rooms are few, and ordinary: but the little apartments, and hiding holes, acce&s;&s;ible only by dark pa&s;&s;ages, and blind &s;tair-ca&s;es, are innumerable. Many of the clo&s;e rece&s;&s;es, which it contains, are probably at this time, unknown. Nothing indeed can mark in &s;tronger colours the fears, and jealou&s;ies, and caution of tho&s;e times, than the internal &s;truc|ture of one of the&s;e ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>Naworth-ca&s;tle was formerly the capital man&s;ion of the barons of Gill&s;land; who, at &s;o great a di&s;tance from court, and &s;eated in a country, at that time, untamed by law, are &s;aid to have exerci&s;ed very extraordinary powers. The Lord William Howard, who is remembered by the name of <HI>bald Willy,</HI> is &s;till the object of invective for his acts of tyranny. His pri&s;ons are &s;hewn; and the &s;ite of his gibbets; where, in the phra&s;e of
<PB N="117" REF="119">
the country, he would <HI>head, and hang <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> out judge, or jury.</HI>&mdash;But it is probable, that his memory is injured. He acted under a &s;tanding commi&s;&s;ion of oyer, and terminer from Elizabeth; and was one of tho&s;e bold &s;pirits, which are nece&s;&s;ary to repre&s;s the vio|lence of lawle&s;s times. Many acts of power undoubtedly he committed: but his difficult &s;ituation compelled him. This part of the kingdom was mo&s;t harra&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e troops of mi&s;chievous banditti; whom I have ju&s;t had occa&s;ion to mention. They were a nu|merous, and not an ill-regulated, body; act|ing under leaders, whom a &s;pirit of enter|prize rai&s;ed to power. The&s;e mi&s;creants, in times even of profounde&s;t peace, called for all the warine&s;s and activity of the chiefs of the country. Sometimes they would plunder in large bodies; and &s;ometimes in little pilfering bands. When they were taken in the fact; or, as it was called, by the <HI>bloody hand,</HI> they were put to in&s;tant death. In other ca&s;es a jury was impannelled.</P>
<P>The active chief, who gave occa&s;ion to this digre&s;&s;ion, &s;eems to have lived in as much terror him&s;elf, as he &s;pread among others. He had contrived a &s;ort of citadel in his own
<PB N="118" REF="120">
ca&s;tle; a room, which is &s;till &s;hewn, with an iron door, where he con&s;tantly &s;lept, and where his armour lies ru&s;ting to this day. From him the earls of Carli&s;le are de&s;cended; and have been, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the proprietors of Naworth-ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>As we left this old fortre&s;s, and de&s;cended the hill towards the ruins of the abbey of Lanerco&s;t, which lie about two miles farther, the whole vale, in which they are &s;eated, opened before us. It is e&s;teemed one of the &s;weete&s;t &s;cenes in this country; and indeed we found it &s;uch. It's area is about half a mile in breadth, and two or three miles in length, con&s;i&s;ting of one ample &s;weep. The &s;ides, which are gentle declivities, are covered thick with wood, in which larger depreda|tions have been lately made, than are con|&s;i&s;tent with picture&s;que beauty.&mdash;At the di&s;tant end of the vale, where the woods appear to unite, the river Irthing enters; which is con|&s;iderable enough, tho divided into two channels, to be fully adequate to the &s;cene.&mdash; The banks of the river, and indeed the whole area of the vale, are &s;prinkled with clumps,
<PB N="119" REF="121">
and &s;ingle trees; which have a good effect in breaking the lines, and regular continuity of the &s;ide-&s;creens; and in hiding, here and there, the cour&s;e of the river; and e&s;pecially the bridges, which would otherwi&s;e be too bare and formal.</P>
<P>Near that extremity of the vale, which is oppo&s;ite to Naworth-ca&s;tle, lies the abbey. At a di&s;tance it forms a good object, ri&s;ing among the woods. As you approach, it be|gins to rai&s;e a di&s;appointment: and on the &s;pot, it is but an unplea&s;ing ruin. The whole is a heavy, Saxon pile; compre&s;&s;ed together without any of that airy lightne&s;s, which accompanies the Gothic. Scarce one <HI>detached</HI> fragment appears in any point of view. The tower is low, and without either form, or ornament; and one of the great ailes is mo|dernized into an awkward pari&s;h-church. The only beautiful part of the whole is the ea&s;t end. It is compo&s;ed of four broken ailes; every wall of which con&s;i&s;ts of two tiers of arches, affording, a very unu&s;ual appearance; and at the &s;ame time a very amu&s;ing confu|&s;ion, from the uncommon multiplication of &s;o many arches, and pillars.&mdash;This part of the abbey &s;eems to have been a &s;eparate
<PB N="120" REF="122">
chapel; or perhaps an oratory belonging to the noble family of Dacre, which had once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the&s;e parts. Here lie the re|mains of &s;everal ancient chiefs of that hou&s;e; who&s;e &s;epulchral honours are now almo&s;t in|tirely obliterated. Their blazoned arms, and Gothic tombs, many of which are &s;umptuous, are &s;o matted with briars, and thi&s;tles, that even the foot of curio&s;ity is kept at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Except the&s;e remains of the abbey-church no other parts of this ancient mona&s;tery are now left; except an old gateway; and a &s;quare building, patched into a farm-hou&s;e, which has no beauty.</P>
<P>In returning to Carli&s;le we pa&s;&s;ed through the valley of Cambeck, which contains &s;ome plea&s;ing &s;cenery; and a very con&s;iderable Roman &s;tation, on a high bank at <HI>Ca&s;tle-&s;teeds.</HI></P>
<P>Rivers often pre&s;ent us with very moral analogies; their characters greatly re&s;embling tho&s;e of men. The violent, the re&s;tle&s;s, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, the active, the &s;luggi&s;h, the gentle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and many other epithets, be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to both. The little &s;tream,

</FIGURE>
<PB N="121" REF="124">
which divides the valley of Cambeck, &s;ug|ge&s;ted the analogy. It's whole cour&s;e is marked with acts of violence. In every part you &s;ee heaps of barren &s;and, and gravel, which in it's furious moods it has thrown up, &s;ome|times on one &s;ide, and &s;ometimes on another; de&s;troying every where the little &s;cenes of beauty, and plots of cultivation.</P>
<P>About three miles further &s;tand the ruins of Scaleby-ca&s;tle. This was another of tho&s;e fortified hou&s;es, which are &s;o frequent in this country.</P>
<P>It &s;tands, as ca&s;tles rarely do, on a flat; and yet, tho it's &s;ite be ill-adapted to any modes of defence, it has been a place of more than ordinary &s;trength. Rocks, knolls, and bold, projecting promontories, on which ca&s;tles u&s;ually &s;tand, &s;ugge&s;t various advan|tages of &s;ituation; and generally determine the kind of &s;tructure. On a flat, the engi|neer was at liberty to choo&s;e his own. Every part was alike open to a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t drew two circular motes round the &s;pot he de&s;igned to fortify: the circumfe|rence of the outward circle was about a mile.
<PB N="122" REF="125">
The earth, thrown out of the&s;e two motes, which were broad and deep, &s;eems to have been heaped up at the centre, where there is a con&s;iderable ri&s;e. On this was built the ca&s;tle, which was entered by two draw-bridges; and defended by a high tower, and a very lofty wall.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, one of the motes only remains. The other is filled up; but may &s;till be traced. The ca&s;tle is more perfect, than &s;uch build|ings commonly are. The walls are very in|tire; and great part of the tower, which is &s;quare, is &s;till left. It pre&s;erved it's perfect form, till the civil wars of the la&s;t century; when the ca&s;tle, in too much confidence of it's &s;trength, &s;hut it's gates again&s;t Cromwell, then marching into Scotland; who made it a monument of his vengeance.</P>
<P>What &s;hare of picture&s;que genius Crom|well might have, I know not. Certain how|ever it is, that no man, &s;ince Henry the eighth, has contributed more to adorn this country with picture&s;que ruins. The differ|ence between the&s;e two ma&s;ters lay chiefly in the &s;tyle of ruins, in which they compo&s;ed. Henry adorned his land&s;capes with the ruins of abbeys; Cromwell, with tho&s;e of ca&s;tles.
<PB N="123" REF="126">
I have &s;een many pieces by this ma&s;ter, executed in a very grand &s;tyle; but &s;eldom a finer monument of his ma&s;terly hand than this. He has rent the tower, and demoli&s;hed two of it's &s;ides; the edges of the other two he has &s;hattered into broken lines. The cha&s;m di&s;covers the whole plan of the internal &s;truc|ture&mdash;the ve&s;tiges of the &s;everal &s;tories&mdash;the in&s;ertion of the arches, which &s;upported them &mdash;the windows for &s;peculation; and the brea&s;t-work for a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>The walls of this ca&s;tle are uncommonly magnificent. They are not only of great height, but of great thickne&s;s; and defended by a large ba&s;tion; which appears to be of more modern workman&s;hip. The greate&s;t part of them is chambered within, and wrought into &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es. A ma&s;&s;y port|cullis gate leads to the ruins of what was once the habitable part of the ca&s;tle, in which a large vaulted hall is the mo&s;t re|markable apartment; and under it, are dark, and capacious dungeons.</P>
<P>The area within the mote, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal acres, was originally intended to &s;upport the cattle, which &s;hould be driven thither in times of alarm. When the hou&s;e
<PB N="124" REF="127">
was inhabited, (who&s;e chearful and better days are &s;till remembered,) this area was the garden; and all around, on the out&s;ide of the mote &s;tood noble trees, irregularly planted, the growth of a century. Beneath the trees ran a walk round the ca&s;tle; to which the &s;ituation naturally gave that plea&s;ing curve, which in modern days hath been &s;o much the object of art. This walk might admit of great embelli&s;hment. On one hand, it com|mands the ruins of the ca&s;tle in every point of view; on the other, a country, which, tho flat, is not unplea&s;ing; con&s;i&s;ting of exten&s;ive meadows, (which a little planting would turn into beautiful lawns,) bounded by lofty mountains.</P>
<P>This venerable pile has now undergone a &s;econd ruin. The old oaks and elms, the ancient natives of the &s;cene, are felled. Weeds, and &s;piry gra&s;s have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the courts, and obliterated the very plan of a garden: while the hou&s;e it&s;elf, (who&s;e ho&s;|pitable roof de&s;erved a better fate,) is now a &s;cene of de&s;olation. Two wretched families, the only inhabitants of the place, occupy the two ends of the vaulted hall; the fragment of a tattered curtain, reaching half was to
<PB N="125" REF="128">
the top, being the &s;imple boundary of their re&s;pective limits. All the re&s;t is wa&s;te: no other part of the hou&s;e is habitable. The chambers unwindowed, and almo&s;t unroofed, fluttering with rags of ancient tape&s;try, are the haunt of daws, and pigeons; which bur&s;t out in clouds of du&s;t, when the doors are opened: while the floors, yielding to the tread, make curio&s;ity dangerous. A few pictures, heir-looms of the wall, which have long de&s;erved oblivion, by I know not what fate, are the only appendages of this di&s;&s;olving pile, which have triumphed over the injuries of time.</P>
<P>Shake&s;pear's ca&s;tle of Macbeth could not be more the haunt of &s;wallows and martins, than this. You &s;ee them every where about the ruins; either twittering on broken coins; threading &s;ome fractured arch; or pur&s;uing each other, in &s;creaming circles, round the walls of the ca&s;tle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this old ca&s;tle the author of this tour was born, and &s;pent his early youth; which mu&s;t be his apology for dwelling &s;o long upon it.&mdash;Since this de&s;cription was written, it has, in &s;ome degree, been repaired.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>OUR la&s;t expedition, in the neighbourhood of Carli&s;le, was to &s;ee the improvements of Mr. Graham of Netherby; and the &s;cene of de&s;olation, occa&s;ioned by the late overflowing of Solway-mo&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Graham's improvements are not con|fined to a garden, or the &s;pace of a mile or two around his hou&s;e. The whole country is changed; and from a barren wa&s;te, hath a&s;&s;umed the face&mdash;if not of beauty, at lea&s;t of fertility.</P>
<P>The domain of Netherby lies on the very &s;kirts of the Engli&s;h border. The Romans con&s;idered it as a part of Caledonia; and &s;hut it from the Briti&s;h pale. In after ages the di&s;trict around it a&s;&s;umed the name of the
<PB N="128" REF="130">
<HI>Debateable-land,</HI> and was the great rendez|vous of tho&s;e crews of outlawed banditti, who, under the denomination of <HI>Mo&s;s-troopers,</HI> plun|dered the country. We have already had occa&s;ion to mention them. In this neighbour|hood were the &s;trong holds of many of their chiefs; particularly of Johnny Arm&s;trong of famous memory; the moted ruins of who&s;e ca&s;tle are &s;till extant.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e people the arts of tillage were unknown. It was ab&s;urd to be at the trouble of &s;owing land them&s;elves, when they could &s;o ea&s;ily plunder the lands of others.</P>
<P>Tho the union of the two kingdoms put an end to the&s;e ravages on the borders; yet the manners of the inhabitants, in &s;ome re&s;pects, &s;uffered little change. Their native lazine&s;s, and inattention to all the arts of hu&s;bandry, remained. They occupied large tracts of ex|cellent land at ea&s;y rates: but having no idea of producing yearly crops from the &s;ame &s;oil by culture; they ploughed their patches of ground alternately, leaving them to recover their fer|tility by fallows. An indolent and &s;canty maintenance was all they wi&s;hed; and this they obtained from a &s;mall portion of their land, with a &s;mall portion of their labour. Their
<PB N="129" REF="131">
lords in the mean time, never lived on the &s;pot; and knew little of the &s;tate either of the country, or of it's inhabitants.</P>
<P>Mr. Graham immediately &s;et him&s;elf to alter this &s;tate of things. He built a noble man&s;ion for him&s;elf; which makes a grand appearance, ri&s;ing on the ruins of a Roman &s;tation. With|out the pre&s;ence of the lord, he knew it was in vain to expect reformation. He divided his lands into moderate farms; and built com|modious farm-hou&s;es. As his lands improved, he rai&s;ed his rents: and his tenants in proportion found it nece&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e their labour. Thus he has doubled his own income, and intro|duced a &s;pirit of indu&s;try into the country. The&s;e indolent inhabitants of the borders begin now to work like other labourers; and notwith&s;tanding they pay higher rents, live more comfortably: for idlene&s;s can never be attended with the comforts of indu&s;try.</P>
<P>To bring about this great change, Mr. Graham thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to rule his &s;ubjects with a rod of iron. While he makes them labourers, he keeps them &s;laves.&mdash;Perhaps indeed the rough manners of the people in
<PB N="130" REF="132">
tho&s;e parts, could not ea&s;ily be moulded by the hand of tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>The feudal idea of va&s;&s;alage, which has long di&s;appeared in all the internal parts of England, remains here in great force; and throws a large &s;hare of power into the hands of the land|holder. Mr. Graham's e&s;tates, which are very exten&s;ive, contain about &s;ix hundred tenants; all of whom, with their families, lie in a manner at his mercy for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Their time and labour he commands, by their mode of tenure, whenever he plea&s;es. Under the denomination of <HI>boon-days,</HI> he expects, at any time, their per&s;onal &s;ervice; and can, in a few hours, mu&s;ter the &s;trength of five or &s;ix hundred men and hor&s;es.</P>

Scotch-borderers, by intercepting the &s;almon in the E&s;k, a body of three hundred of the&s;e people marched down upon him with an in|tention to de&s;troy his works. He had intelli|gence of their de&s;ign, and i&s;&s;uing his precepts, mu&s;tered, in a few hours, above four hundred men before his gates, armed as the exigence would allow: and if the Scotch, on finding &s;uch &s;uperiority, had not retreated, Mr. Gra|ham, who told us the &s;tory him&s;elf, &s;aid he believed, that all the &s;pirit and animo&s;ity of ancient times would have revived on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In a civil light he acts on as large a &s;cale. His manor-courts are kept with great &s;trict|ne&s;s; in which his attorney, with a jury, &s;its regularly to try cau&s;es; and the tenants are injoined, at the hazard of being turned out of their farms, to bring into the&s;e courts every &s;uit under the value of five pounds. Thus he prevents much ill-blood among them, by bring|ing their di&s;putes to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue; and giving the quarrel no time to rankle. He &s;aves them al&s;o much expence: for a &s;uit, which in the

<P>The works on the E&s;k, which gave &s;o much offence to the Scotch-borderers, de&s;erve more notice. They con&s;i&s;ted of a ma&s;&s;y head thrown acro&s;s the river, con&s;tructed, at a great ex|pence, of hewn &s;tone. This mole was formed at right angles with the bank; but the floods of the en&s;uing winter &s;wept it away. It was attempted a &s;econd time on the &s;ame plan; but was a &s;econd time de&s;troyed. Mr. Brindley was then &s;ent for, who&s;e works near Manche&s;|ter had given him &s;o high a reputation. He changed the plan; and in&s;tead of carrying the mole in a direct line acro&s;s the river, formed it in a curve, arching again&s;t the &s;tream: &s;o that it re&s;i&s;ts the current, as a bridge does the incumbent weight.

The E&s;k, which was before in compari&s;on, a &s;hallow &s;tream, gliding un&s;een beneath it's banks, is now a noble piece of water, rai&s;ed to a level with them, and &s;een to great advantage from the hou&s;e, and every part of the ground.</P>

Solway-mo&s;s, de&s;troyed lately &s;o large a di&s;trict. To &s;ee the effects of this, was the object of our next expedition.</P>
<P>Solway-mo&s;s is a flat area, about &s;even miles in circumference. The <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> of it is a gro&s;s fluid, compo&s;ed of mud, and the putrid fibres of heath, diluted by internal &s;prings, which ari&s;e in every part. The <HI>&s;ur|face</HI> is a dry cru&s;t, covered with mo&s;s, and ru&s;hes; offering a fair appearance over an un&s;ound bottom&mdash;&s;haking under the lea&s;t pre&s;|&s;ure. Cattle by in&s;tinct know, and avoid it. Where ru&s;hes grow, the bottom is &s;ounde&s;t. The adventrous pa&s;&s;enger therefore, who &s;ome|times, in dry &s;ea&s;ons, traver&s;es this perilous wa&s;te to &s;ave a few miles, picks his cautious way over the ru&s;hy tu&s;&s;ocks, as they appear before him. If his foot &s;lip, or if he venture to de&s;ert this mark of &s;ecurity, it is po&s;&s;ible he may never more be heard of.</P>
<P>At the battle of Solway, in the time of Henry VIII, Oliver Sinclair was imprudently &s;et over the Scotch army, which had no con|fidence in him. A total rout en&s;ued; when an unfortunate troop of hor&s;e, driven by their fears, plunged into this mora&s;s, which in|&s;tantly clo&s;ed upon them. The tale, which
<PB N="135" REF="137">
was traditional; was generally believed; but is now authenticated. A man and hor&s;e in compleat armour were lately found by the peat-diggers, in the place, where it was always &s;uppo&s;ed the affair had happened; and are pre&s;erved at the hou&s;e of a Scotch baronet, if I mi&s;take not, of the name of Maxwell; as we were informed by a gentleman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph Dacre, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Kirklinton, near Longtown.</NOTE> of the borders, who a&s;&s;ured us he had &s;een them him&s;elf. The &s;keleton of each was well pre|&s;erved; and the different parts of the armour ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Solway-mo&s;s is bounded on the &s;outh by a cultivated plain, which declines gently, through the &s;pace of a mile, to the river E&s;k. This plain is rather lower than the mo&s;s it&s;elf, being &s;eparated from it by a brea&s;twork formed by digging peat, which makes an irregular, tho perpendicular, line of low, black boundary.</P>
<P>It was the bur&s;ting of the mo&s;s through this peat brea&s;twork, over the plain between it and the E&s;k, which occa&s;ioned that dreadful ruin, the effects of which we came hither to explore. &mdash;The more remarkable circum&s;tances, re|lating
<PB N="136" REF="138">
to this calamitous event, as we had them on the be&s;t authority, were the&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 16th of November, 1771, in a dark tempe&s;tuous night, the inhabitants of the plain were alarmed with a dreadful cra&s;h, which they could in no way account for. Many of them were then abroad in the fields, watching their cattle; le&s;t the E&s;k, which was ri&s;ing violently in the &s;torm, &s;hould carry them off. None of tho&s;e mi&s;erable people could conceive the noi&s;e they heard to proceed from any cau&s;e, but the overflowing of the river in &s;ome &s;hape, tho to them unaccountable. Such indeed, as lived nearer the &s;ource of the eruption, were &s;en&s;ible, that the noi&s;e came in a different direction; but were equally at a lo&s;s for the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mean time the enormous ma&s;s of fluid &s;ub&s;tance, which had bur&s;t from the mo&s;s, moved &s;lowly on, &s;preading it&s;elf more and more, as it got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the plain. Some of the inhabitants, through the terror of the night, could plainly di&s;cover it advanc|ing, like a moving hill. This was in fact the ca&s;e; for the gu&s;h of mud carried before it,
<PB N="137" REF="139">
through the fir&s;t two or three hundred yards of it's cour&s;e, a part of the brea&s;twork; which, tho low, was yet &s;everal feet in perpendicular height. But it &s;oon depo&s;ited this &s;olid ma&s;s; and became a heavy fluid. One hou&s;e after another, it &s;pread round&mdash;filled&mdash;and cru&s;hed into ruin; ju&s;t giving time to the terrified inhabitants to e&s;cape. Scarce any thing was &s;aved; except their lives: nothing of their furniture: few of their cattle. Some people were even &s;urprized in their beds, and had the additional di&s;tre&s;s of flying naked from the ruin.</P>
<P>The morning-light explained the cau&s;e of this amazing &s;cene of terror; and &s;hewed the calamity in it's full extent: and yet, among all the conjectures of that dreadful night, the mi&s;chief which really happened, had never been &s;uppo&s;ed. Who could have imagined, that a brea&s;twork, which had &s;tood for ages, &s;hould at length give way? or that tho&s;e &s;ub|terraneous floods, which had been bedded in darkne&s;s, &s;ince the memory of man, &s;hould ever bur&s;t from their black abode?</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="140">This dreadful inundation, tho the fir&s;t &s;hock of it was the mo&s;t tremendous, continued &s;till &s;preading for many weeks, till it covered the whole plain&mdash;an area of five hundred acres; and, like molten metal poured into a mould, filled all the hollows of it, lying in &s;ome parts thirty or forty feet deep, reducing the whole to one level &s;urface. The overplus found it's way into the E&s;k; where it's quantity was &s;uch, as to annoy the fi&s;h; no &s;almon, during that &s;ea&s;on, venturing into the river. We were a&s;&s;ured al&s;o, that many lumps of earth, which had floated out at &s;ea, were taken up, &s;ome months after, at the i&s;le of Man.</P>
<P>As we de&s;cended from the higher grounds to take a nearer view of this &s;cene of horror, it exhibited a very grand appearance. The whole plain was covered by a thick &s;moke, occa&s;ioned by a &s;mothering fire &s;et to it in various parts, with a view to con&s;ume it; and brought before us that &s;imple, and &s;ublime idea of <HI>the &s;moke of a country going up like the &s;moke of a furnace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="141">When we came to the plain on that &s;ide, which is next the E&s;k, it had &s;o forbidding an a&s;pect, as far as we could di&s;cover through the &s;moke, that we almo&s;t de&s;paired of cro&s;&s;ing to the cha&s;m, as we had intended. On hor&s;e|back it was impo&s;&s;ible; and when we had alighted, we &s;tood he&s;itating on the brink, whether it were prudent, even on foot, to attempt &s;o dangerous a march.</P>
<P>While we remained in this &s;ituation, we ob&s;erved &s;everal groups of pea&s;ants working in the ruins: and beckoning to the neare&s;t, one of the group came forward. He was an el|derly man, &s;trengthening his &s;teps with a long mea&s;uring wand. His features, and gait, tho hard and clowni&s;h, were marked with an air of vulgar con&s;equence. As he approached, one of our company, who knew him, acco&s;ted him by the name of Wil&s;on; and we found he was the per&s;on who conducted the works which were &s;et on foot to clear the &s;oil of this melancholy incumbrance.</P>
<P>On informing him of our difficulties, and a&s;king, whether we might venture acro&s;s the plain; he bad us, like Cae&s;ar, with an air of a&s;&s;urance, follow him, and fear nothing. From one tu&s;&s;ock to another we followed,
<PB N="140" REF="142">
&s;ometimes &s;tepping&mdash;&s;ometimes leaping&mdash;and &s;ometimes he&s;itating, whether to go on, or to return. In very difficult places, our guide conde&s;cended to lay us a plank. In the mid&s;t of our perplexity, one of our company, &s;tray|ing a &s;tep from the right path, fell in; but the mud being &s;hallow in that part, he &s;ank only to the knees. Mr. Wil&s;on helped him out; but reprimanded his carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. The reproof and the example having a good effect upon us all, we followed our guide, like pack-hor&s;es in a &s;tring, and at length compleated our undertaking.</P>
<P>When we got to the gulph, from whence all this mi&s;chief had i&s;&s;ued, the &s;pectacle was hideous. The &s;urface of <HI>the mo&s;s it&s;elf</HI> had &s;uffered little change. Near the cha&s;m it appeared indented, through a &s;pace of &s;everal yards: but not in any degree, as one would have expected from &s;o va&s;t a di&s;charge. The mouth of the cha&s;m was heaped round by mon&s;trous piles of ruin, formed by the broken brea&s;twork, and &s;hell of the mo&s;s, on the fir&s;t great bur&s;t; and a black, mo&s;&s;y tincture continued &s;till to i&s;&s;ue from it. If this con|tinue to run, as it probably will, it may be a fortunate circum&s;tance; and &s;ave the country
<PB N="141" REF="143">
from any farther mi&s;chief, by draining this bloated ma&s;s through a perpetual di&s;charge.</P>
<P>As we &s;tood on the higher ground, and got to windward of the &s;moke, we obtained a clear idea of the plain, and of the cour&s;e of the irruption over it. Many fragments of a very large &s;ize, which had been carried away in the fir&s;t full &s;tream of the di&s;charge, appeared thrown to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The&s;e were what made that moving bulwark, which &s;ome of the inhabitants had &s;een in the night. Fragments of a &s;maller &s;ize, (and yet many of the&s;e con&s;iderable) appeared &s;cattered over the plain, as the heavy torrent was able to carry them. The inter&s;tices between the fragments, which had been filled with fluid mo&s;s, were now baked by the heat of the &s;un, and cru&s;ted over like the great &s;urface of the mo&s;s it&s;elf. Here and there, along this &s;urface, the broken rafters of a hou&s;e, or the top of a bla&s;ted tree were &s;een; and made an odd appearance, ri&s;ing as it were, out of the ground. But through the whole wa&s;te, there was not the lea&s;t &s;ign left of any culture; tho this plain had once been the pride of the country. Lands, which
<PB N="142" REF="144">
in the evening would have let for twenty &s;hillings an acre, by the morning-light were not worth &s;ix-pence.</P>
<P>On this well cultivated plain twenty-eight families had their dwellings, and little farms; every one of which, except perhaps a few, who lived near the &s;kirts of it, had the world totally to begin again.&mdash; Mr. Graham, agree|ably to the prudential maxims he has ever ob&s;erved, affords them little a&s;&s;i&s;tance him&s;elf; and di&s;courages the bounty of others. &mdash; He &s;eems to wi&s;h his dominions &s;hould thrive by indu&s;try alone; and would have his &s;ubjects depend on this great virtue for the &s;upply of every want, and the reparation of every lo&s;s. If the maxim, in &s;o full an extent, be good; it requires at lea&s;t, a great hardine&s;s of re&s;olu|tion to carry it into practice.</P>
<P>Whether the immen&s;e work of clearing this plain can ever totally be effected, is a doubt with many. It is attempted however with great &s;pirit, through the united force of the two powerful elements of fire and water.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145">All the &s;kirts, and other parts of it which are drier than the re&s;t, are reduced by fire; which occa&s;ioned the great &s;moke from the plain, as we de&s;cended into it; and which, at that di&s;tance, appeared to ari&s;e from the whole area.</P>
<P>But this method is not found very effectual; as it reaches only a little below the &s;urface. Much more is expected from the application of water; which is the part our guide Mr. Wil&s;on has undertaken.&mdash;How well qualified he is for the undertaking, and in what manner he propo&s;es to accompli&s;h it, may be conceived from the following &s;tory.</P>
<P>Mr. Graham's hou&s;e &s;tands on an eminence, with higher grounds above it. A little on one &s;ide of the front, &s;tood a knoll, which made a di&s;agreeable appearance before his windows.&mdash; Being de&s;irous therefore of removing it, he &s;ent to Newca&s;tle for a per&s;on accu&s;tomed to works of this kind. The undertaker came, &s;urveyed the ground, and e&s;timated the expence at thir|teen hundred pounds.</P>
<P>While the affair was in agitation, Mr. Gra|ham heard, that Wil&s;on had &s;aid, the earth
<PB N="144" REF="146">
might be removed at a much ea&s;ier rate. He was examined on the &s;ubject; and his an&s;wers appeared &s;o rational, that he was &s;et to work. He had already &s;urveyed the higher grounds, where he fir&s;t collected all the &s;prings he found, into two large re&s;ervoirs; from which he cut a precipitate channel, pointed at an abrupt corner of the knoll. He cut al&s;o a channel of communication between his two re&s;ervoirs. The&s;e being both filled, he opened his &s;luices, and let out &s;uch a continued torrent of water, (the upper pool feeding the lower) that he very &s;oon carried away the corner of the knoll, again&s;t which he had pointed his artillery. He then charged again, and levelled again&s;t another part with equal &s;ucce&s;s. In &s;hort, by a few efforts of this kind, he carried away the whole hill; and told Mr. Graham, with an air of triumph, that, if he plea&s;ed, he would carry away his hou&s;e next. The work was compleated in a few days; and Mr. Gra|ham him&s;elf informed us, that the whole expence did not amount to twenty pounds.</P>
<P>This man, with &s;o much genius about him, lives in the lowe&s;t &s;tile of life; and works for the lowe&s;t wages. When we regretted, that he was paid &s;o inadequately to his worth, we
<PB N="145" REF="147">
were a&s;&s;ured, as his appearance indeed te&s;tified, that he had no higher idea of happine&s;s, than to get drunk after his day's labour: and that better wages would only de&s;troy him &s;ooner.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince heard, that one hundred and fifty acres of the plain are now cleared by the ingenuity of this man; and that there is rea&s;on to believe, he will in time clear a con&s;iderable part of it. From the re&s;ervoirs formed by a little &s;tream at the highe&s;t part of the over|flowed ground, he cut channels in various directions to the E&s;k: and when the water was let off, he placed numbers of men by the &s;ide of the &s;tream, who rolled into it large ma&s;&s;es of mo&s;&s;y earth, which were hardened by the &s;un.</P>

<P>HAVING &s;een &s;uch parts of the country on the borders of England, as were mo&s;t curious; we &s;et out on our return. But, in&s;tead of taking the Ke&s;wick-road, we propo&s;ed to vary our rout, by the mountains of Brugh<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 168, Vol. I.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At Penrith the road divides. We turned to the left, towards Appelby; and &s;oon fell into a rich, and beautiful vale, in which the river Lowther, gliding under lofty woody banks, bore us company a con&s;iderable way.</P>
<P>When we cro&s;&s;ed that river, the &s;ituation of Brougham-ca&s;tle, one of the &s;eats of the
<PB N="148" REF="149">
celebrated counte&s;s of Pembroke, attracted our notice. It had not e&s;caped the notice of the Romans; who fixed here a &s;tation to com|mand the country. It appears as great, at this time, in a picture&s;que light, as it did formerly in a military one. But we had not time to ride up to it; contenting our&s;elves with viewing it only as the ornament of a &s;econd di&s;tance.</P>
<P>At Clifton the road opens again into a wild &s;cene. Here we examined the &s;pot, where, in the year 1745, the rebels entering an in|clo&s;ed country, made a &s;tand; and lined the hedges to retard the duke of Cumberland's pur&s;uit. Sir Jo&s;eph York, in his road from Ireland, had been there, we found, a few days before. He had accompanied the duke in his expedition again&s;t the rebels; and &s;topped a little at Clifton to review the &s;cene. He left the people, we were informed, much plea&s;ed with his remembering a gallant action, which had been achieved, about that time, by a heroine of the country, who had carried a letter acro&s;s the fire of the rebels, when no other me&s;&s;enger could be obtained.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="150">From Clifton, we turned a little a&s;ide to &s;ee Lowther-hall, the &s;eat of lord Lond&s;dale. It is only a temporary hou&s;e, the old man&s;ion having been burnt in the time of the late lord. But materials are now collecting for a grand &s;tructure. It is &s;ituated in an exten|&s;ive park, which contains a great variety of beautiful &s;cenery.</P>
<P>From Lowther-hall, we pur&s;ued our rout to Appelby, keeping on our left that va&s;t tract of barren country, called Wingfield-fore&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Appelby-ca&s;tle, which be|longs to the earl of Thanet, is magnificent. It &s;tands on a rocky eminence, falling preci|pitately into the river Eden; which half in|circles it. The banks of the river, and the &s;ides of the precipice, are finely hung with wood. The ca&s;tle is &s;till in good repair; and is a noble pile. But, in a picture&s;que light, it lo&s;es half it's beauty, from it's being broken into two parts. A <HI>&s;maller</HI> break from a grand pile removes heavine&s;s; and is a &s;ource

But here the whole is divided into two parts, of &s;uch <HI>equal</HI> dimen&s;ions, that each a&s;pires to pre-eminence. Each therefore becomes a &s;eparate whole: and both together di&s;tract the eye. The detached part &s;hould always ob&s;erve a due inferiority.</P>
<P>We had not time to take a view <HI>from</HI> the ca&s;tle; which mu&s;t command a very beautiful di&s;tance, over the woody vale of Eden, and the mountains, which ari&s;e beyond it.</P>
<P>Appelby-ca&s;tle was the Apallaba of the Romans; and pre&s;erves it's origin clearer in it's etymology, than the generality of Roman &s;tations.</P>
<P>This ca&s;tle was formerly the favourite man|&s;ion of Ann, counte&s;s of Pembroke, Dor&s;et, and Montgomery. As this very extraordinary lady is &s;till the object of great veneration in the&s;e parts; as her hi&s;tory is curious, and le&s;s known than it ought to be; and as it is &s;o

<P>She was the daughter of George Clifford, earl of Cumberland; one of the heroes of the gallant age of Elizabeth. This noble per&s;on di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf chiefly by his naval ex|peditions; on which he was &s;uffered, in tho&s;e frugal times, to expend a great portion of his patrimony. In return for his patrioti&s;m, he was appointed by his royal mi&s;tre&s;s, her champion in all tilts and tournaments; where the grace, and dignity of his behaviour, and his &s;kill and addre&s;s in arms, were equally admired. The rich armour he wore, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, is &s;till &s;hewn in this ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Lady Ann Clifford was only ten years of age, when her father died. But her educa|tion was conducted by two excellent women&mdash; her mother, a daughter of the earl of Bedford&mdash; and afterwards by her aunt the counte&s;s of Warwick.</P>
<P>In her early youth &s;he married lord Buck|hur&s;t, earl of Dor&s;et; with whom during a few years &s;he lived very happily. But he &s;oon leaving her a widow; &s;he married, &s;ix years after, Philip earl of Pembroke, and Montgomery.</P>

For, it &s;eems, her immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the large e&s;tates of her ance&s;tors in the north, had been di&s;puted by an uncle, who inherited the title: and an award had been given again&s;t her by James I, to which indeed &s;he would never &s;ubmit. The uncle, and his &s;on however both dying, the great e&s;tates of the Cliffords, tho con&s;iderably impaired by her father's genero&s;ity, came to her without any farther mole&s;tation. She had be&s;ides two great jointures. That which &s;he re|ceived from her fir&s;t hu&s;band, was between three, and four thou&s;and, a year; and that from the earl of Pembroke was nearly equal to it.</P>
<P>On the event of the earl of Pembroke's death, &s;he immediately laid out the whole plan of her future life; determining to retire into the north; and &s;pend it on her own e&s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155">In ancient times the earls of Cumberland po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed five noble ca&s;tles in the three coun|ties of York&s;hire, We&s;tmoreland, and Cum|berland&mdash;Skipton&mdash;Pendragon&mdash;Appelby&mdash; Brougham&mdash;and Brugh. The tower of Bar|don al&s;o was another fortified &s;eat, where they &s;ometimes re&s;ided. But all the&s;e ca&s;tles had &s;uffered in the late civil wars; and were reduced, more or le&s;s, to a &s;tate of great decay.</P>
<P>The counte&s;s of Pembroke however deter|mined, on her coming into the north, to repair and furni&s;h them all. This great work &s;he compleated during the years 1657, and 1658; and placed over the gate of each ca&s;tle the following in&s;cription:</P>
<P>THIS CASTLE WAS REPAIRED BY THE LADY ANN CLIFFORD, COUNTESS DOWAGER OF PEMBROKE, &amp;c. IN THE YEAR &mdash; AFTER THE MAIN PART OF IT HAD LAIN RUINOUS EVER SINCE 1648, WHEN IT WAS DEMOLISHED, ALMOST TO THE GROUND BY THE PARLIA|MENT THEN SITTING AT WESTMINSTER, BE|CAUSE IT HAD BEEN A GARRISON IN THE CIVIL WARS. IS. LVIII. 12. LAUS DEO!</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="156">Oliver Cromwell was, at this time, at the head of affairs; who&s;e hypocri&s;y and villany the counte&s;s of Pembroke dete&s;ted: and as &s;he had too much &s;pirit to conceal her &s;en|timents, it is probable, the protector was enough informed, how little &s;he e&s;teemed him. Her friends therefore, knowing the jealou&s;y of his temper, advi&s;ed her not to be &s;o profu&s;e in building; as they were well a&s;&s;ured that as &s;oon as &s;he had built her ca&s;tles, he would order them to be de&s;troyed. But &s;he an&s;wered with great &s;pirit, "Let him de&s;troy them if he will: but he &s;hall &s;urely find, that as often as he de&s;troys them, I will rebuild them, while he leaves me a &s;hilling in my pocket."</P>
<P>She &s;hewed her contempt for Cromwell, and her own high &s;pirit, on another occa&s;ion. Her uncle had left her affairs &s;o involved, that &s;he found her&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of re|covering &s;ome of her rights by a tedious law|&s;uit. The affair being repre&s;ented to Crom|well by the oppo&s;ite party, he offered his mediation. But &s;he an&s;wered loftily, &s;he would never accept it, while there was any
<PB N="156" REF="157">
law to be found in England. "What! &s;aid &s;he, does he imagine, that I, who refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to king James, will &s;ubmit to him?"</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding her &s;pirit, neither her ca&s;tles, nor her e&s;tates were injured. Some a&s;cribed this lenity to Cromwell's re|verence of her virtue; which is very im|probable: others, to her numerous friends, with whom the protector wi&s;hed to keep fair; which, it is mo&s;t likely, was the truth.</P>
<P>Her di&s;like to Cromwell was not founded on party; but on principle. She had the &s;ame di&s;like to Charles, when &s;he became acquainted with the &s;pirit of his government. On being pre&s;&s;ed by her friends, &s;ometime after the re&s;toration, to go to court; "By no means, &s;aid &s;he; unle&s;s I may be allowed to wear blinkers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Blinkers are tho&s;e blinds affixed to the bridles of coach-hor&s;es, which prevent their &s;eeing what they ought not to &s;ee.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Be&s;ides her ca&s;tles, &s;he found likewi&s;e in ruins, almo&s;t all the churches, belonging
<PB N="157" REF="158">
to the &s;everal villages on her e&s;tates. The &s;pire of one had been beaten down: another had been turned into a magazine: a third into a ho&s;pital. Seven of them were in this ruinous condition: each of which &s;he either built from the ground, or repaired; furni&s;h|ing them all with decent pews; that her tenants, in every part of her e&s;tates, might have churches in their neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Her &s;everal buildings, and repairs, at her fir&s;t coming into the north, did not co&s;t her le&s;s, than forty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>At each of her ca&s;tles &s;he re&s;ided a part of every year; regularly moving from one to the other; thus over-looking the whole of her va&s;t e&s;tates; and ble&s;&s;ing the country, wherever &s;he went. For &s;he was every where the common patrone&s;s of all, who were di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed. Her heart was as large, as her abi|lity: and mi&s;ery of every kind, that could get it's &s;tory fairly repre&s;ented to her, was &s;ure of relief.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159">Nor was &s;he content with <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> acts of charity; but made many of her charitable intentions <HI>permanent</HI> by endowments. The greate&s;t of the&s;e works were two ho&s;pitals, which &s;he founded.</P>
<P>One little plea&s;ing monument of this kind &s;tands by the &s;ide of the road, between Pen|rith and Appelby. It is a monument indeed rather of her filial piety, than of her charity. On this &s;pot, in her early youth, &s;he had parted with her beloved mother; whom &s;he never afterwards &s;aw. She always remem|bered this parting-&s;cene with the tendere&s;t feelings: and, when &s;he came into We&s;t|moreland, among her other buildings, &s;he rai&s;ed a pillar to record it; with a &s;tone-table at it's ba&s;e. The pillar, which is &s;till known in the country by the name of <HI>Counte&s;s-pillar,</HI> is decorated with her arms; a &s;un|dial, for the benefit or travellers; and the following in&s;cription.</P>
<Q><PB N="159" REF="160">THIS PILLAR WAS ERECTED IN THE YEAR 1656, BY ANN COUNTESS DOWAGER OF PEM|BROKE, &amp;c. FOR A MEMORIAL OF HER LAST PARTING, IN THIS PLACE, WITH HER GOOD AND PIOUS MOTHER, MARGARET, COUNTESS DOWAGER OF CUMBERLAND, ON THE 2d OF APRIL 1616: IN MEMORY WHEREOF SHE HATH LEFT AN ANNUITY OF &pound;.4. TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE POOR OF THE PARISH OF BROUGHAM, EVERY 2d DAY OF APRIL FOR EVER, UPON THE STONE-TABLE PLACED HARD BY. LAUS DEO!</Q>
<P>Her very hou&s;e-hold was a noble charity. Her &s;ervants were generally the children of her tenants; and were &s;ure of a provi&s;ion, if they behaved well. Her women-&s;ervants had always little portions given them, to begin the world with, if they married to plea&s;e her.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161">The calamities of the times al&s;o, during Cromwell's government, particularly the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of &s;everal ejected mini&s;ters of the church, furni&s;hed her with ample op|portunities of exerting her genero&s;ity. Among others, &s;he was particularly kind to King, afterwards bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter; and Duppa, and Morley, both afterwards bi&s;hops of Win|che&s;ter. To each of the&s;e &s;he allowed 40&pound;. a year; and when, in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es abroad, they informed her, that a &s;um of money would be of more &s;ervice to them, than the annuities &s;he was plea&s;ed to give them; &s;he remitted a thou&s;and pounds to be divided among them.</P>
<P>She was a lady of uncommon prudence in the management of her affairs. Bi&s;hop Rain|bow &s;ums up her character on this head, in two words, by calling her a perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of <HI>foreca&s;t,</HI> and <HI>afterca&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>For the numberle&s;s acts of bounty, that flowed from her &s;he depended on two things&mdash;
<PB N="161" REF="162">
her exactne&s;s in keeping accounts; and her great economy.</P>
<P>With regard to the former, in whatever ca&s;tle &s;he re&s;ided, an office was kept, in which all her receipts, and di&s;bur&s;ements were en|tered with commercial punctuality. Of her private charities, &s;he kept an account her&s;elf: but was &s;o exact, that, at any time by com|paring it with her public accounts, &s;he had, at once, a compleat view of the &s;ituation of her affairs.</P>
<P>Her economy was equal to her exactne&s;s. Nothing was &s;pent in vanity. Nothing was trifled away. All her family-expences were under the article of nece&s;&s;aries: and the very form of regularity, in which they con&s;tantly ran, made one year a check upon another.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit, which &s;he &s;hewed in defend|ing her rights, may perhaps be mentioned al&s;o among her plans of economy. It was a &s;pirit not often exerted; but when it was rai&s;ed, it always carried her vigorou&s;ly to the end of the que&s;tion; and, no doubt, &s;ecured her from many contentions, which might otherwi&s;e have di&s;turbed her, in the mid&s;t of &s;o complex a property; and in tho&s;e dubious
<PB N="162" REF="163">
days, when legal rights were &s;o much un|hinged. I have mentioned her &s;pirit, in one &s;uit, with regard to an affair of con&s;equence. We have an account of another of le&s;s impor|tance.</P>
<P>It was a cu&s;tom, on all her e&s;tates, for each tenant to pay, be&s;ides his rent, an an|nual <HI>boon-hen,</HI> as it was called. This had ever been acknowledged a ju&s;t claim; and is, I believe, to this day, paid on many of the great e&s;tates in the north; being gene|rally con&s;idered as a &s;teward's perqui&s;ite.</P>
<P>It happened, that a rich clothier from Ha|lifax, one Murgatroyd, having taken a tene|ment near Skipton, was called upon by the &s;teward of the ca&s;tle for his <HI>boon-hen.</HI> On his refu&s;al to pay it, the counte&s;s ordered a &s;uit to be commenced again&s;t him. He was ob&s;tinate; and &s;he determined; &s;o it was car|ried into length. At la&s;t &s;he recovered her hen; but at the expence of 200&pound;.&mdash;It is &s;aid, that after the affair was decided, &s;he invited Mr. Murgatroyd to dinner; and draw|ing the hen to her, which was &s;erved up as the fir&s;t di&s;h, "Come, &s;aid &s;he, Mr. Mur|gatroyd, let us now be good friends: Since
<PB N="163" REF="164">
you allow the hen to be dre&s;&s;ed at my table, we'll divide it between us."</P>
<P>She had a mind improved, and cultivated in many parts of learning. Dr. Donn, in his humourous manner, u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>&s;he knew how to conver&s;e of every thing; from prede&s;ti|nation to &s;lea-&s;ilk</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A kind of raw &s;ilk u&s;ed, at that time, in embroidery.</NOTE>. But hi&s;tory &s;eems to have been her chief amu&s;ement; to the &s;tudy of which &s;he was probably fir&s;t led, by examin|ing the hi&s;tory of her own ance&s;tors. This indeed comprehended, in a great degree, the hi&s;tory of England from the times of the conque&s;t: for there were few &s;cenes of public life, in which her progenitors, the Veteriponts and the Cliffords, an active race of men, were not deeply engaged.</P>
<P>She &s;eems to have entertained a de&s;ign of collecting materials for a hi&s;tory of the&s;e two potent northern families. At a great expence &s;he employed learned men to make collections, for this purpo&s;e, from the records in the tower; the rolls; and other depo&s;itaries of
<PB N="164" REF="165">
public papers; which being all fairly tran|&s;cribed, filled three large volumes. This work, which contains a great variety of ori|ginal characters, exerting them&s;elves on very important occa&s;ions, is &s;till among the family-records at Appelby-ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>While &s;he was thus careful to pre&s;erve the honour of her ance&s;tors; &s;he in&s;tituted a very &s;evere hi&s;torical re&s;traint, if I may &s;o call it, on her&s;elf. In a large folio volume, which made a part of her equipage, when &s;he tra|velled from one ca&s;tle to another, &s;he ordered an entry to be made, under her own in&s;pection, of the tran&s;actions of every day. To what particulars this journal extended, I have not learned. But if it was kept, as it probably was, by a confidential &s;ecretary, it might have included very minute particulars. What an intere&s;ting collection of valuable anecdotes might be furni&s;hed from the incidents of &s;uch a life! What a &s;atyr would it be on the vanity, the di&s;&s;ipation, and frivolous employ|ments of the generality of the great! This work, I am informed, is &s;till extant; and in the hands of the earl of Thanet.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166">But the mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of the cha|racter of this illu&s;trious lady, was her piety, and great attachment to religion. No doubt the amiable in&s;tructors of her youth had given her di&s;po&s;ition, which was naturally &s;erious, a proper direction: but perhaps the be&s;t &s;chool, in which &s;he had learned to think ju&s;tly, was, that &s;chool of affliction, the hou&s;e of her &s;econd hu&s;band, the earl of Pembroke; who&s;e di&s;&s;i|pated, abandoned life taught her, more than any thing el&s;e, the vanity of all earthly things, unle&s;s u&s;ed for the purpo&s;es they were given.</P>
<P>Few divines were better ver&s;ed in &s;cripture, than &s;he was. She could quote it pertinently on all occa&s;ions; and never failed to read a portion of it every day; or have it read to her, in the latter part of her life.</P>
<P>The new te&s;tament was her principal &s;tudy. Next to it &s;he was particularly fond of the p&s;alms of David; and had tho&s;e appointed for the day, read regularly to her.</P>
<P>She had been bred up in the church of England from her youth; and tho &s;he could not, in the fanatical times of the u&s;urpation, attend any public &s;ervice; yet in the wor&s;t
<PB N="166" REF="167">
of tho&s;e times &s;he never failed to hear the church-&s;ervice in her own private chapels, which &s;he had been careful to fit up in all her ca&s;tles. Many menaces of &s;eque&s;trations &s;he received from the ruling powers, if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in that practice. But &s;he &s;hewed the &s;ame &s;pirit on this occa&s;ion, which &s;he had before &s;hewn on many others. She con|tinued her practice; and left them to do as they plea&s;ed. No attempts however were made again&s;t her.</P>
<P>She had no idea of pomp, and grandeur. With regard to her&s;elf, her mode of living was rather par&s;imonious. Amid&s;t all the ob|jects of her genero&s;ity, her&s;elf was the only per&s;on forgotten. In her diet &s;he was even ab&s;temious; and would &s;ometimes plea&s;antly boa&s;t, that &s;he had &s;carce ever ta&s;ted wine, or phy&s;ick; during her whole life. Of the elegance of dre&s;s &s;he had never been fond; but in her latter life &s;he laid it intirely a&s;ide; wearing nothing, for many years, but a clo&s;e habit of plain, black &s;erge; which occa&s;ioned many plea&s;ant mi&s;takes between her, and her attendants.</P>
<P>Her retinue was merely for u&s;e, not parade. Be&s;ides her common dome&s;ticks, &s;he had al|ways
<PB N="167" REF="168">
two ladies of education, who lived with her. Many hours &s;he &s;pent alone: at other times, they read to her, and were her com|panions.</P>
<P>Her chief expence, as far as concerned her|&s;elf, was in books. Her library was &s;tored with all the be&s;t writers in the Engli&s;h lan|guage. She knew no other.</P>
<P>Such was the life of this excellent lady; equally &s;uited to any &s;tation, in which God had plea&s;ed to place her. It was a life of no more indulgence, than the mo&s;t abridged circum&s;tances would have allowed. Her abi|lity in doing good, was that only, in which &s;he exceeded others.</P>
<P>She lived twenty-&s;ix years, after the death of her &s;econd hu&s;band: Providence lengthen|ing out her life, as a ble&s;&s;ing to the country, beyond her eightieth year. The 23d of March 1675 was the day of her di&s;&s;olution&mdash;one of the mo&s;t melancholy days the northern coun|ties ever experienced.</P>
<P>In her ended the noble family of the Clif|fords. Her daughter Margaret, by the earl of Dor&s;et (her &s;ole &s;urviving heire&s;s) marry|ing
<PB N="168" REF="169">

<P>FROM Appelby-ca&s;tle we &s;oon approach the barrier-mountains: but we approach them, in the u&s;ual order of nature, by regular progre&s;s. The ground is fir&s;t high, before it becomes mountainous; and tillage appears in &s;canty plots, before cultivation cea&s;es.</P>
<P>A little to the north of Brugh, the ground on the left, makes a &s;ingular appearance. A hill, on which a fair is annually held, forms an exact, &s;emi-circular convex. Scarce a knoll, or bu&s;h break the regularity of the line. Be|yond this, but without any intervening ground, ri&s;es a range of di&s;tant mountains. The&s;e wore a light purple hue, when we &s;aw them&mdash; the circular hill, a deep green. Perhaps no di&s;po&s;ition of ground was ever more totally
<PB N="170" REF="171">
unpicture&s;que: and yet even this (&s;uch is the force of contra&s;t) if it be only bi&s;ected, and in a &s;mall degree adorned, is not wholly di&s;|agreeable.</P>
<P>At the commencement of the mountains &s;tand the town, and ca&s;tle of Brugh, not unplea&s;antly &s;eated. The ca&s;tle which con|&s;i&s;ts, like that at Appelby, of two parts, &s;eems to have been a very &s;trong place. Since the time of it's la&s;t noble inhabitant, the counte&s;s of Pembroke, it has been falling fa&s;t into ruin; but we found it no ea&s;y matter, even yet, to &s;cale the out-works of it's earthen mounds: &s;o &s;trong a fortre&s;s hath it once been.&mdash;Some parts of it, e&s;pecially a &s;hattered round tower, are very picture&s;que.</P>
<P>We had not the opportunity of &s;eeing this ca&s;tle in &s;o advantageous a light, as had fa|voured us, when we &s;aw the ca&s;tle of Penrith. We &s;aw them both in the evening; but here we had no bright beam of &s;un-&s;et to <HI>illumine the ruins.</HI> And yet the effect was grand. The ca&s;tle and land&s;cape around, were in deep &s;hadow; under the influence of a retiring &s;torm, which had hung a &s;ettled gloom on all
<PB N="171" REF="172">
the upper regions of the &s;ky. The &s;un was invi&s;ible; but had fired the whole we&s;tern horizon with a deep red. We viewed the ca&s;tle from the ea&s;t; and had therefore the ruddy part of the hemi&s;phere as a back-ground to the grey tints, and &s;trong &s;hadows of the towers, and battlements, which intervened. The&s;e, with the deep &s;olemnity of the gloom, were a &s;uffi|cient balance to the glowing red of the horizon, which would otherwi&s;e have been too glaring. But the whole was in perfect harmony; and had a fine effect.&mdash;Indeed nature's <HI>colouring</HI> is rarely without harmony. If the lights be glowing, the &s;hades are proportionably deep: on the contrary, if the lights decay, the &s;ha|dows decay with them; and as light is al&s;o the &s;ource of colour, the land&s;cape wears always one uniform hue. Either the <HI>&s;ober colouring</HI> prevails, or one <HI>vivid tint</HI> &s;upports another. In <HI>compo&s;ition,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the idea of improving natural compo&s;ition, ex|plained, p. 119, &amp;c.

<PB N="172" REF="173">
of her colouring, &s;he is an undeviating model of perfection.</P>
<P>The &s;quare tower, which made the grand part of the ca&s;tle, conveyed, as we looked into it, a very horrid idea. Mo&s;t of the&s;e old &s;tructures have &s;uffered great <HI>external</HI> dilapi|dations. But here the <HI>&s;hell</HI> was intire; and all the <HI>internal</HI> parts were gone&mdash;the roof, the &s;tories, and even the vault over the dun|geon. The whole was a mere excavation. I know not, that I was ever &s;truck with a more horrid idea of the kind. The eye, confined within the walls of a va&s;t tower, open to the &s;ky above, which loured with unu&s;ual black|ne&s;s, looked down with hideous contra&s;t, deep into a dungeon below.</P>
<P>The whole road, over the mountains of Stainmore, from Brugh-ca&s;tle to Bowes-ca&s;tle, which is about thirteen miles, is the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant that can be conceived; and the more &s;o, as it reminded us of the &s;ublime &s;cenes, which we had pa&s;&s;ed, in another part of this chain, between Amble&s;ide and Ke&s;wick.
<PB N="173" REF="174">
In the mountains of Stainmore, the parts are neither &s;ufficiently ample to be grand; nor rich and varied, to be beautiful.

<P>Nothing remains of Bowes-ca&s;tle, but one heavy, &s;quare tower, much defaced, and ruin|ed; tho the &s;tone-work appears to have been excellent. This fortre&s;s &s;eems originally to have been intended as a defence at the &s;outhern end of the mountains; as Brugh-ca&s;tle was at the northern.</P>
<P>From the po&s;ition of the&s;e ca&s;tles, it &s;eems probable, that formerly the road over the mountains of Stainmore was the only road into Cumberland, that was pa&s;&s;able, and of cour&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to be defended. The Ke&s;wick moun|tains,
<PB N="174" REF="175">

<P>As we leave the mountains, a very rich and exten&s;ive view opens before us into York&s;hire. We had not &s;een &s;uch a view for many days. For tho in Cumberland, we had many very exten&s;ive pro&s;pects, yet they extended chiefly over barren country.</P>
<P>At Grata we found much deva&s;tation from the late high floods. The bridge was beaten down; and large fragments of it carried away, through the violence of the &s;tream, many hundred yards. With the&s;e, and huge &s;tones torn from the adjoining cliffs, the bed of the river was choaked. Nothing could have a more ruinous appearance. A broken bridge impre&s;&s;es one of the &s;tronge&s;t emblems of de&s;olation, from the idea of cutting off all intercour&s;e among men.</P>

<P>THE mo&s;t improved part of the gardens at Studley, and what is chiefly &s;hewn to &s;trangers, is a valley, nearly circular, &s;ur|rounded by high woody grounds, which &s;lope gently into it in various directions. The cir|cumference of the higher grounds includes about one hundred and fifty acres; the area, at the bottom, con&s;i&s;ts of eight. The higher parts pre&s;ent many openings into the country. The lower, of cour&s;e, are more confined; but might afford many plea&s;ing woody &s;cenes, and &s;olitary retreats. A con&s;iderable &s;tream runs through the valley: and on the banks of this &s;tream, in another valley, contiguous to the circular one, &s;tand the ruins of Fountain's abbey; the grande&s;t, and mo&s;t beautiful, except perhaps tho&s;e of Gla&s;tonbury, which the kingdom can produce.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="181">The idea, which &s;uch a &s;cene naturally &s;ugge&s;ts, is that of retirement&mdash;the habitation of chearful &s;olitude. Every object points it out; all tending to &s;ooth and amu&s;e; but not to rou&s;e and tran&s;port; like the great &s;cenes of nature.</P>
<P>Sometimes indeed the reclu&s;e may be more enamoured of the great &s;cenes of nature, and wi&s;h to fix his abode, where his eye may be continually pre&s;ented with &s;ublime ideas. But, in general, we ob&s;erve (from the whole hi&s;tory of mona&s;tic life) that he wi&s;hes rather to &s;eque&s;ter him&s;elf in &s;ome tranquil &s;cene: and this in particular was cho&s;en as a quiet rece&s;s, con&s;ecrated to retirement.</P>
<P>Solitude therefore being the reigning idea of the &s;cene, every accompaniment &s;hould tend to impre&s;s it. The ruins of the abbey, which is the great object of the place, certainly do. The river and the paths &s;hould wind carele&s;ly through the lawns and woods, with little decoration. Buildings &s;hould be &s;paringly introduced. Tho&s;e which appear, &s;hould be as &s;imple as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;the mere retreats of &s;olitude. The &s;cene allows no more; and the
<PB N="181" REF="182">
neighbourhood of &s;o noble a ruin renders every other decoration, in the way of building, either trivial, or offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of the&s;e ideas, which the &s;cenes of Studley naturally &s;ugge&s;t, the whole is a vain o&s;tentation of expence; a mere <HI>Timon's villa;</HI> decorated by a ta&s;te debauched in it's concep|tions, and puerile in it's execution. Not only the reigning idea of the place is forgotten; but all the great ma&s;ter-&s;trokes of nature, in every &s;hape are effaced. Every part is touched and retouched with the in&s;ipid &s;edulity of a Dutch ma&s;ter:
<Q>&mdash;Labor improbus omnia vincit.</Q></P>
<P>What a lovely &s;cene might a per&s;on of pure ta&s;te have made at Studley, with one tenth part of the expence, which hath been laid out in deforming it.</P>
<Q><L>Fre&s;h &s;hadows fit to &s;hroud from &s;unny ray;</L>
<L>Fair lawns to take the &s;un in &s;ea&s;on due;</L>
<L>Sweet &s;prings, in which a thou&s;and nymphs did play;</L>
<L>Soft, tumbling brooks, that gentle &s;lumber drew;</L>
<L>High reared mounts, the lands about to view;</L>
<L><PB N="182" REF="183">Low-winding dales, di&s;loigned from common gaze;</L>
<L>Delightful bowers to &s;olace lovers true.</L></Q>
<P>Such might have been the &s;cenes of Studley: but &s;uch is the whim&s;ical channel of human operations, that we &s;ometimes &s;ee the pencil of Reubens employed on a country wake; and that of Teniers di&s;gracing the nuptials of an emperor.</P>
<P>On the whole, it is hard to &s;ay, whether nature has done more to embelli&s;h the &s;cenes of Studley; or art to deform them. Much indeed is below critici&s;m. But even, where the rules of more genuine ta&s;te have been adopted, they are for the mo&s;t part unhappily mi&s;applied. In the point of opening views, for in&s;tance, few of the openings here are &s;imple, and natural. The artifice is apparent. The marks of the &s;heers, and hatchet, are con&s;picuous in them all. Whereas half the beauty of a thing con&s;i&s;ts in the ea&s;ine&s;s of it's introduction. Bring in your &s;tory awk|wardly; and it offends. It is thus in a view. The eye roving at large in que&s;t of objects, cannot bear pre&s;cription. Every thing forced
<PB N="183" REF="184">
upon it, di&s;gu&s;ts; and when it is apparent, that the view is <HI>contrived;</HI> the <HI>effect is lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The valley, in which Fountain's abbey &s;tands, is not of larger dimen&s;ions, than the other, we have ju&s;t de&s;cribed: but in&s;tead of the circular form, it winds (in a more beautiful proportion) into length. It's &s;ides are com|po&s;ed of woody hills &s;loping down in varied declivities; and uniting with the trees at the bottom, which adorn the river.</P>
<P>At one end of this valley &s;tand the ruins of the abbey, which formerly over&s;pread a large &s;pace of ground. Be&s;ides the grand remains of ruin, there appeared in various parts, among the trees and bu&s;hes, detached fragments, which were once the appendages of this great hou&s;e. One of the&s;e, which was much ad|mired, &s;eemed evidently to have been a court of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Such was the general idea of this beautiful valley, and of the ruins which adorned it, before they fell into the hands of the pre&s;ent proprietor. Long had he wi&s;hed to draw them
<PB N="184" REF="185">
within the circle of his improvements: but &s;ome difficulties of law with&s;tood. At length they were removed; and the time came (which every lover of picture&s;que beauty mu&s;t lament) when the legal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this beautiful &s;cene was yielded to him; and his bu&s;y hands were let loo&s;e upon it. He found it indeed &s;ome|what ruder, than even picture&s;que beauty required; and a little might have been well done. But <HI>his improvements</HI> have had no bounds. He has pared away all the bold roughne&s;s, and freedom of the &s;cene, and given every part a trim poli&s;h.</P>
<P>A few fragments lying &s;cattered around the body of a ruin are <HI>proper,</HI> and <HI>picture&s;que.</HI> They are <HI>proper,</HI> becau&s;e they account for what is defaced: and they are <HI>picture&s;que,</HI> becau&s;e they unite the principal pile with the ground; on which union the beauty of com|po&s;ition, in a good mea&s;ure, depends.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the &s;ame idea in mountains, p. 55, Vol. II. and in building, p. 150, and afterwards in cattle, Sect. XXXI.</NOTE> But here they were thought rough and un&s;ightly; and fell a &s;acrifice to neatne&s;s. Even the court of ju&s;tice was not &s;pared; tho a
<PB N="185" REF="186">
fragment, probably as beautiful, as it was curious.</P>
<P>In the room of the&s;e detached fragments, which were the proper, and picture&s;que em|belli&s;hments of the &s;cene, a gaudy temple is erected, and other trumpery wholly foreign to it.&mdash;It is a difficult matter, at the &s;ight of &s;uch mon&s;trous ab&s;urdities, to keep re&s;ent|ment within decent bounds. I hope I have not exceeded.</P>
<P>But not only the &s;cenery is defaced, and the outworks of the ruin violently torn away; the main body of the ruin it&s;elf, is, at this very time, under the alarming hand of decoration.</P>
<P>The remains of this pile are very magnifi|cent. Almo&s;t the intire &s;keleton of the abbey-church is left, which is a beautiful piece of Gothic architecture. The tower &s;eems wholly to have e&s;caped the injuries of time. It's mouldering lines only are &s;oftened. Near the church &s;tand a double row of cloy&s;ters; which are &s;ingularly curious from the pointed arches, which do the office of columns, in &s;upporting the roof. At the end of the&s;e cloy&s;ters &s;tand the abbot's apartments; which open into a court, called the Monk's-garden. On one
<PB N="186" REF="187">
&s;ide of this court is the hall, a noble room; which communicates, in the &s;pirit of ho&s;pi|tality, with the kitchen. There are be&s;ides a few other detached parts.</P>
<P>When the pre&s;ent proprietor made his pur|cha&s;e, he found this whole ma&s;s of ruin, the cloy&s;ters, the abbey-church, and the hall, choaked with rubbi&s;h. His fir&s;t work there|fore was to clear, and open. And <HI>&s;omething</HI> in this way, as I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, might have been done with propriety. For we &s;ee ruins &s;ometimes &s;o choaked, that no view of them can be obtained.</P>
<P>To this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ucceeded the great work of <HI>re&s;toring,</HI> and <HI>ornamenting.</HI> This required a very delicate touch. Among the ruins were found &s;craps of Gothic windows; &s;mall, mar|ble columns; tiles of different colours; and a variety of other ornamental fragments. The&s;e the proprietor has picked from the rubbi&s;h with great care; and with infinite indu&s;try is now re&s;toring to their old &s;ituation. But in vain; for the friability of the edges of every fracture makes any re&s;toration of parts an awkward patchwork.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="188">Indeed the very idea of giving a fini&s;hed &s;plendor to a ruin, is ab&s;urd. How unnatural, in a place, evidently forlorn and de&s;erted by man, are the <HI>recent</HI> marks of human indu&s;try! &mdash;Be&s;ides, every &s;entiment, which the &s;cene &s;ugge&s;ts, is de&s;troyed. In&s;tead of that &s;ooth|ing melancholy, on which the mind feeds in contemplating the ruins of time; a &s;ort of jargon is excited by the&s;e heterogeneous mix|tures: as if, when &s;ome grand chorus had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul&mdash;when the &s;ounds in all their &s;ublimity, were yet vibrating on the ear&mdash;a light jig &s;hould &s;trike up.</P>
<P>But the <HI>re&s;toration</HI> of parts is not enough: <HI>ornaments</HI> mu&s;t be added: and &s;uch incon|gruous ornaments, as di&s;graced the <HI>&s;cene,</HI> are di&s;gracing al&s;o the <HI>ruin.</HI> The monk's <HI>garden</HI> is turned into a trim parterre, and planted with flowering &s;hrubs: a view is opened, through the great window, to &s;ome ridiculous figure, (I know not what; Ann Bolein, I think, they called it) that is placed in the valley; and in the central part of the abbey-church, a circular pede&s;tal is rai&s;ed out of the fragments of the

Root|ed for ages in the &s;oil; a&s;&s;imilated to it; and become, as it were, a part of it; we con&s;ider it as a work of nature, rather than of art. Art cannot reach it. A Gothic window, a fretted arch, &s;ome trivial peculiarity may have been aimed at with &s;ucce&s;s: but the <HI>magnifi|cence</HI> of ruin was never attained by any modern attempt.</P>
<P>What reverence then is due to the&s;e &s;acred relics; which the rough hand of temerity, and caprice dare mangle without remor&s;e? The lea&s;t error is irretrievable. Let us pau&s;e a

<P>About the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century, a piece of human antiquity exi&s;ted in the neighbour|hood of this abbey, &s;till more curious, than the abbey it&s;elf&mdash;that venerable in&s;tance of longevity, Henry Jenkins. Among all the events, which, in the cour&s;e of a hundred and &s;ixty-nine years, had fa&s;tened upon the memory of this &s;ingular man, he &s;poke of nothing with &s;o much emotion, as the ancient &s;tate of Foun|tain's abbey. If he were ever que&s;tioned on that &s;ubject, he would be &s;ure to inform you, "What a brave place it had once been;" and would &s;peak with much feeling of the clamour, which it's di&s;&s;olution occa&s;ioned in the coun|try.

<P>FROM Studley we vi&s;ited the &s;cenes of Hackfall. The&s;e own the &s;ame pro|prietor; and are adorned with equal ta&s;te.</P>
<P>It is a circum&s;tance of great advantage, when you are carried to this grand exhibition (as you always &s;hould be) through the <HI>clo&s;e lanes</HI> of the Rippon road. You have not the lea&s;t intimation of a de&s;ign upon you; nor any &s;ugge&s;tion, that you are on high grounds; till the folding-doors of the building at Mow|bray-point being thrown open, you are &s;truck with one of the grande&s;t, and mo&s;t beautiful bur&s;ts of country, that the imagination can form.</P>
<P>Your eye is fir&s;t carried many fathoms pre|cipitately down a bold, woody &s;teep, to the river Ewer, which forms a large &s;emi-circular
<PB N="192" REF="193">
curve below; winding to the very foot of the precipice, on which you &s;tand. The trees of the precipice over-hang the central part of the curve.</P>
<P>In other parts too the river is intercepted by woods; but enough of it is di&s;covered to leave the eye at no uncertainty in tracing it's cour&s;e. At the two oppo&s;ite points of the curve, two promontories &s;hoot into the river, in contra&s;t with each other: that on the right is woody, faced with rock, and crowned with a ca&s;tle: that, on the left, ri&s;es &s;mooth from the water, and is &s;cattered over with a few clumps. The penin&s;ular part, and the grounds al&s;o at &s;ome di&s;tance beyond the i&s;thmus, con|&s;i&s;t of one intire woody &s;cene; which ad|vancing boldly to the front of the precipice, unites it&s;elf with it.</P>
<P>This woody &s;cenery on the banks of the river may be called the fir&s;t di&s;tance. Beyond this lies a rich, exten&s;ive country&mdash;broken into large parts&mdash;decorated with all the ob|jects, and diver&s;ified with all the tints of di&s;tant land&s;cape&mdash;retiring from the eye, &s;cene after &s;cene&mdash;till at length every vivid hue fading gradually away, and all di&s;tinction of parts being lo&s;t, the country imperceptibly
<PB N="193" REF="194">
melts into the horizon; except in &s;ome parts, where the blue hills of Hambledon clo&s;e the view.</P>
<P>Through the whole extent of this grand &s;cene&mdash;this delightful gradation of light and colours&mdash;nature has wrought with her broade&s;t, and free&s;t pencil. The parts are ample: the compo&s;ition perfectly correct. She hath ad|mitted nothing di&s;gu&s;ting, or even trivial. I &s;carce remember any where an exten&s;ive view &s;o full of beauties, and &s;o free from faults. The fore-ground is as plea&s;ing as the back|ground; which it never can be, when plots of cultivation approach the eye: and it is rare to find &s;o large an extent of near-ground, covered by wood, or other &s;urface, who&s;e parts are alike grand, and beautiful.</P>
<P>The vale, of which this view is compo&s;ed, hath not yet intirely lo&s;t it's ancient name&mdash; the <HI>vale of Mowbray;</HI> &s;o called from Mow|bray-ca&s;tle now no longer traced even in it's ruins; but once &s;uppo&s;ed to be the capital man&s;ion of the&s;e wide domains. This vale extends from York almo&s;t to the confines of Durham; is adorned by the Swale, and the Ewer, both con&s;iderable rivers; and is cer|tainly
<PB N="194" REF="195">
one of the noble&s;t tracts of country of the kind in England.</P>
<P>Hackfall is as much a contra&s;t to Studley, as the idea of <HI>magnificence</HI> is to that of <HI>&s;olitude.</HI> It requires of cour&s;e a different mode of or|nament. A banqueting hou&s;e, inriched with every elegance of architecture, in the form perhaps of a Grecian temple, might be a proper decoration at Mowbray-point; which at Studley would be &s;uperfluous, and ab&s;urd. The ruins of a ca&s;tle too, if they <HI>could</HI> be ex|ecuted with veri-&s;imilitude and grandeur, might adorn the rocky promontory on the right with propriety. The pre&s;ent ruin is a paltry thing. Any other ornamental building, be&s;ides the&s;e two, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary. The&s;e might &s;ufficiently adorn every part of the &s;cenery, both in the higher, and in the lower grounds. If the expence, which is generally laid out, in our great gardens, on a variety of <HI>little</HI> buildings, was confined to one or two <HI>capital objects,</HI> the general effect would be better. A profu&s;ion of buildings is one of the extravagances of fal&s;e ta&s;te. <HI>One</HI> ob|ject is a proper ornament in every &s;cene: more
<PB N="195" REF="196">
than one, at lea&s;t on the fore-grounds, di&s;tract it. Particular circum&s;tances indeed may add a <HI>propriety</HI> to a greater number of objects: as at Kew; where a &s;pecimen is given of dif|ferent kinds of religious &s;tructures: or at Chi&s;|wick; where it is intended to exhibit an idea of various modes of architecture. But it is <HI>unity</HI> of <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> not of <HI>picture&s;que compo&s;ition,</HI> which plea&s;es us in the&s;e &s;cenes. As far as this is concerned, one hand&s;ome object is enough.</P>
<P>Having examined the whole of this very extraordinary bur&s;t of land&s;cape from Mow|bray-point, we de&s;cended to the bottom, where a great variety of grand, and plea&s;ing views are exhibited; particularly a view of Mow|bray-point from Limus-hill; and another of the promontory with the ca&s;tle upon it, from the tent: and it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that many of the&s;e &s;cenes are opened in a very natural, and ma&s;terly manner. If any art hath been u&s;ed, it hath been u&s;ed with di&s;|cretion.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, amid&s;t all this profu&s;ion of great objects, and all this grandeur of <HI>de|&s;ign</HI>
<PB N="196" REF="197">
(for nature has here not only brought her materials together, but has compo&s;ed them likewi&s;e) the eye is every where called a&s;ide from the contemplation of them by &s;ome tri|vial object&mdash;an awkward ca&s;cade&mdash;a fountain&mdash; a view through a hole cut in a wood&mdash;or &s;ome other ridiculous &s;pecimen of ab&s;urd ta&s;te.</P>
<P>It is a great happine&s;s however, that the improver of the&s;e &s;cenes had le&s;s in his power at Hackfall, than he had at Studley. The vallies there, and home-views were all with|in the reach of his &s;pade, and axe. Here he could only contemplate at a di&s;tance what glorious &s;cenes he might have di&s;played, if his arm could have extended to the horizon. Some of the nearer grounds of this grand ex|hibition, (I believe all beyond the Ewer,) are the property of another per&s;on. So that the whole penin&s;ular part, and the grounds immediately beyond it, continue &s;acred, and untouched: and the&s;e are the &s;cenes, which form the grand part of the view from Mow|bray-point. In &s;urveying the&s;e, the eye over|looks the puerilities of improvement at the bottom of the precipice.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="198">The banks of rivers are &s;o various, that I know not any two river-views of any celebrity, which at all re&s;emble each other in the <HI>detail;</HI> though in the <HI>general ca&s;t, and outlines</HI> of the &s;cene, they agree. Thus at Studley, and at <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 102.</NOTE> Corby, the materials of the &s;cenery are, in both places, the &s;ame. Each hath it's woody banks&mdash;it's river&mdash;and the ruins of an abbey. In each al&s;o the beauties of the &s;cene are in a great mea&s;ure &s;hut up within it&s;elf; and the idea of &s;olitude is impre&s;&s;ed on both. Notwith|&s;tanding this &s;imilarity, two &s;cenes can hardly be more different. At Corby, the woody bank is grander than that at Studley, border|ing rather on the &s;ublime. At Studley, the form and contra&s;t of the vallies, and great variety of the ground, is more plea&s;ing. In the former &s;cene the river is &s;uperior: in the latter, the ruins. In one, you wander about the mazes of a circular woody bank: in the other, the principal part of the walk is con|tinued along the margin of the river; the

woody bank, which is too &s;teep to admit a path, &s;erving only as a &s;kreen.</P>
<P>There is the &s;ame union and difference be|tween the &s;cenes of Persfield<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See ob&s;ervations on the Wye, page 39.</NOTE>, and Hackfall. Both are <HI>great</HI> and <HI>commanding</HI> &s;ituations. The river, in both, forms a <HI>&s;weeping curve.</HI> Both are adorned with <HI>rocks, and woods:</HI> and &s;ublimity is the reigning idea of each. Not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e points of union, they are wholly unlike. Persfield, though the country is open before it, depends little on it's beauties. It's own wild, winding banks &s;upply an endle&s;s variety of rocky &s;cenery; which is &s;ufficient to engage the attention. The banks of Hackfall are le&s;s magnificent; tho it's river is more picture&s;que, and it's woods more beautiful. But it's views into the country are it's pride; and beyond any com|pari&s;on, grander and more inchanting, than tho&s;e at Persfield.</P>
<P>From Hackfall we returned to our ho&s;pi|table quarters at <HI>Norton Conyers,</HI> which is
<PB N="199" REF="200">
&s;ituated in a plea&s;ant park-&s;cene; but too flat to admit much variety.</P>
<P>In the time of the civil wars, the owner of this man&s;ion was Sir Richard Graham; of whom we heard an anecdote in the family, which is worth relating; as it is not only curious in it&s;elf, but throws a very &s;trong, and yet natural &s;hade, on the character of Cromwell.</P>
<P>When the affairs of Charles I. were in their wane in all the &s;outhern counties; the marqui&s;s of Newca&s;tle's prudence gave them &s;ome credit in the north. His re&s;idence was at York, where he engaged two of the gen|tlemen of the country to act under him as lieutenants. Sir Richard Graham was one; who&s;e commi&s;&s;ion under the marqui&s;s is &s;till in the hands of the family. As Sir Richard was both an active man, and much attached to the royal cau&s;e; he entered into it with all that vigour, which ability; in&s;pired by in|clination, could exert; and did the king more effectual &s;ervice, than perhaps any private gentleman in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="201">On that fatal day, when the precipitancy of prince Rupert, in oppo&s;ition to the &s;age advice of the marqui&s;s, led the king's forces out of York again&s;t Cromwell, who waited for them on Mar&s;den-moor, Sir Richard Gra|ham had a principal command; and no man did more than he, to end an action with &s;uc|ce&s;s, which had been undertaken with teme|rity.</P>
<P>When the day was irretrievably lo&s;t; and nothing remained, but for every man to &s;eek the be&s;t means of &s;ecurity that offered, Sir Richard fled, with twenty-&s;ix bleeding wounds upon him, to his own hou&s;e at Norton Con|yers, about fifteen miles from the field. Here he arrived in the evening; and being &s;pent with lo&s;s of blood, and fatigue, he was car|ried into his chamber; where taking a la&s;t farewell of his di&s;con&s;olate lady, he expired.</P>
<P>Cromwell, who had ever expre&s;&s;ed a pecu|liar inveteracy again&s;t this gentleman, and thought a victory only half obtained, if he e&s;caped; pur&s;ued his flight in per&s;on, with a troop of hor&s;e.</P>
<P>When he arrived at Norton, his gallant enemy was dead; having &s;carce lived an hour.
<PB N="201" REF="202">
after he was carried into his chamber: and Cromwell found his wretched lady weeping over the mangled corp&s;e of her hu&s;band, yet &s;carce cold.</P>
<P>Such a &s;ight, one would have imagined, might have given him&mdash;not indeed an emo|tion of pity&mdash;but at lea&s;t a &s;atiety of revenge. The inhuman mi&s;creant &s;till felt the vengeance of his &s;oul un&s;atisfied; and turning round to his troopers, who had &s;talked after him into the &s;acred rece&s;&s;es of &s;orrow, he gave the &s;ign of havoc; and in a few moments the whole hou&s;e was torn in pieces: not even the bed was &s;pared, on which the mangled body was extended: and every thing was de&s;troyed, which the hands of rapine could not carry off.</P>
<P>In this country we met with another cu|rious memorial of the battle of Mar&s;den-moor. A carpenter, about two years ago, bought &s;ome trees, which had grown there. But when the timber was brought to the &s;aw-pit, it was found very refractory. On examining it with more attention, it appeared, that great
<PB N="202" REF="203">
numbers of leaden bullets were in the hearts of &s;everal of the trees; which thus recorded the very &s;pot, where the heat of the battle had raged.</P>

<P>FROM Norton we propo&s;ed to take our rout, through York&s;hire into Derby|&s;hire; and &s;o through the other midland counties into the &s;outh of England.</P>
<P>The town of Rippon makes a better ap|pearance, as you approach it, than the gene|rality of country towns. The church is a large building; and gives a con&s;equence to the place.</P>
<P>From Rippon the road is not unplea&s;ant; pa&s;&s;ing generally through a woody country, till we entered Knare&s;borough-fore&s;t, where all wood cea&s;ed. Like other royal cha&s;es, it hath now lo&s;t all it's &s;ylvan honours, and is a wild, bleak, unornamented tract of country.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="205">Near the clo&s;e of the fore&s;t, lies Harrogate, in the dip of a hill; a cheerle&s;s, unplea&s;ant village. Nor does the country make any change for the better; till we cro&s;s the ri|ver Wharf.</P>
<P>From hence, leaving the ruins of Hare|wood-ca&s;tle on the left, and Harewood-hou&s;e on the right, the ancient, and modern &s;eats of the family of La&s;celles, we a&s;cended, by degrees, a tract of high ground, and had an exten&s;ive view which was illumined, when we &s;aw it, by tho&s;e gleaming, cur&s;ory lights, which are &s;o beautiful in di&s;tant land&s;cape; and &s;o common, when the incidents of a bright &s;un, a windy &s;ky, and floating clouds co|incide. It is amu&s;ing, under the&s;e circum|&s;tances, to pur&s;ue the flitting gleams, as they &s;pread, decay, and vani&s;h&mdash;then ri&s;e in &s;ome other part; varied by the different &s;urfaces, over which they &s;pread.</P>
<P>We have this appearance beautifully de|tailed in an old Er&s;e poem, the title of which is Dargo. The bard poetically, and pictu|re&s;quely
<PB N="205" REF="206">
compares the &s;hort tran&s;itions of joy in the mind, to the&s;e tran&s;itory gleams of light.</P>
<P>"The tales of the years that are pa&s;t, are beams of light to the &s;oul of the bard. They are like the &s;un-beams, that travel over the heaths of Morven. Joy is in their cour&s;e, tho darkne&s;s dwells around. Joy is in their cour&s;e; but it is &s;oon pa&s;t: the &s;hades of darkne&s;s pur&s;ue them: they overtake them on the mountains; and the foot&s;teps of the chearful beam are no longer di&s;covered.&mdash;Thus the tale of Dargo travels over my &s;oul like a beam of light, tho the gathering of the clouds is behind."</P>
<P>We &s;hould have been glad to have ex|amined Harewood-hou&s;e, as it is a &s;umptuous pile; but it is &s;hewn only on particular days; and we happened to be there on a wrong one.</P>
<P>We regretted al&s;o another misfortune of the &s;ame kind, for which we had only our|&s;elves to blame; and that was the omi&s;&s;ion of Kirk&s;tall-abbey. In the precipitancy of

an early morning, and through an unaccount|able error in geography, we pa&s;&s;ed it; and did not recollect the mi&s;take, till we were half a day's journey beyond it.</P>
<P>Around Leeds the &s;oil wears an unplea&s;ant hue; owing in part to the dirtine&s;s of the &s;urface; within a few yards of which, coal is every where found.&mdash;The country however changes greatly for the better, before we ar|rive at Wakefield, which lies in the mid&s;t of beautiful &s;cenery. The river Calder makes a fine appearance, as we leave the town; and it's banks are adorned by a Gothic cha|pel, now in ruins, dedicated, by Edward IV, to the memory of the duke of York, his fa|ther, and the other chiefs of his party, who fell at the battle of Wakefield. It is built in the elegant proportion of ten by &s;ix; plain on the &s;ides; but richly adorned on the front; and fini&s;hed with a &s;mall octagon turret at the ea&s;t end.&mdash;This little edifice &s;erves both to a&s;certain the hi&s;tory of architecture, which appears to have been near it's meridian; and to illu&s;trate an important part of the Engli&s;h &s;tory. It's whim&s;ical &s;ituation by the &s;ide
<PB N="207" REF="208">
of a bridge, was intended probably to mark the &s;pot, where &s;ome principal part of the action happened: tho at the entrance of great towns it was not unu&s;ual, in popi&s;h times, to place chapels on bridges; that travellers might immediately have the benefit of a ma&s;s. There was, for this purpo&s;e, a chapel formerly in one of the piers of London-bridge.</P>
<P>Not far from Wakefield we rode pa&s;t a piece of water, which takes the humble name of a mill-pond; but is in fact a beautiful little lake, being near two miles in circum|ference, and containing &s;ome plea&s;ing &s;cenery, along it's little woody &s;hores, and promon|tories.</P>
<P>From Bank-top we had a good de&s;cending view of Wentworth-ca&s;tle&mdash;of the grounds, which inviron it&mdash;and the country, which &s;urrounds it. The &s;cene all together is grand. The eminence, on which we &s;tood, is adorned with a great profu&s;ion of &s;omething, in the way of an artificial ruin. It is po&s;&s;ible it may have an effect from the ca&s;tle below:
<PB N="208" REF="209">
but <HI>on the &s;pot,</HI> it is certainly no orna|ment. We found &s;ome difficulty in pa&s;&s;ing through lord Strafford's park; and proceeded therefore to Wentworth-hou&s;e; which is a &s;uperb; and is e&s;teemed, an elegant pile: but there &s;eems to be a want of &s;implicity about it. The front appears broken into too many parts; and the in&s;ide, incumbered. A &s;im|ple plan has certainly more dignity. Such, for in&s;tance, is lord Tinley's hou&s;e at Wan|&s;tead, where the whole is intelligible <HI>at &s;ight.</HI> The hall at lord Rockingham's is a cube of &s;ixty feet. The gallery is what they call a <HI>&s;helf.</HI> For my&s;elf, I &s;aw nothing offen&s;ive in it, tho it is undoubtedly a more ma&s;terly contrivance to rai&s;e a gallery <HI>upon</HI> a wall, than to affix one <HI>to it.</HI> The long gallery is a noble apartment; and the interception of a breakfa&s;t room from it by pillars, and an oc|ca&s;ional curtain, gives a plea&s;ant combined idea of retirement, and company. The li|brary al&s;o is grand.</P>
<P>There are few good pictures at Wentworth: the original of lord Strafford, and his &s;ecre|tary is &s;aid to be here. It's preten&s;ions are di&s;puted; tho I think it has merit enough to maintain them any where.&mdash;There is an|other

good portrait by Vandyke of the &s;ame nobleman.

<P>FROM Wentworth-hou&s;e the &s;ame plea|&s;ant face of country continues to Sheffield. But it &s;oon begins to change, as we approach Derby&s;hire. The ri&s;ing grounds become in|&s;en&s;ibly more wild: rocks &s;tart every where from the &s;oil; and a new country comes on apace. For we now approached that great central tract of high lands; which ari&s;ing in the&s;e parts, form them&s;elves into moun|tains; and &s;preading here, and there, run on without interruption, as far as Scotland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 3, Vol. I.</NOTE> Before we reach Middleton, the whole face of the land has &s;uffered change; and we &s;ee nothing around us, but wildne&s;s, and de&s;ola|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="212">About two miles &s;hort of Middleton we are cheared again by a beautiful valley; which participates indeed of the wildne&s;s of the coun|try; but is both finely wooded, and watered. In a rece&s;s of this valley &s;tands Middleton, a very romantic village; beyond which the valley &s;till continues two miles farther.</P>
<P>It is this <HI>continuation</HI> of it, which is known by the name of Middleton-dale; and is e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t romantic &s;cenes of the country. It is a narrow, winding cha&s;m; hardly broader than to give &s;pace for a road. On the right, it is rocky; on the left, the hills wear a &s;moother form. The rocks are grey, tinged in many parts with plots of ver|dure in&s;inuating them&s;elves, and running among them. Some of the&s;e rocks a&s;&s;ume a peculiar form, rearing them&s;elves like the round towers, and buttre&s;&s;es of a ruined ca&s;tle; and their upper &s;trata running in parallel directions, take the form of cornices. The <HI>turriti &s;copuli</HI> of Virgil cannot be illu&s;trated better.</P>
<P>When we leave Middleton-dale the wa&s;tes of Derby&s;hire open before us; and wear the &s;ame face as tho&s;e we had left behind, on the
<PB N="213" REF="213">
borders of York&s;hire. They are tracts of coar&s;e, moori&s;h pa&s;turage, forming va&s;t con|vex &s;weeps, without any inter&s;ection of line, or variation of ground; divided into portions by &s;tone walls, without a cottage to diver&s;i&s;y the &s;cene, or a tree to enliven it. Middleton|dale is the pa&s;s, which unites the&s;e two dreary &s;cenes.</P>
<P>Having travelled &s;everal miles in this high country, in our way to Ca&s;tleton, we came at length to the edge of a precipice; down which ran a long, &s;teep de&s;cent. From the brow an exten&s;ive vale lay before us. It's name is Hopedale. It is a wide, open &s;cene of cultivation; the &s;ides of which, tho moun|tainous, are tilled to the top. The village of Hope &s;tands at one end of it, and Ca&s;tleton at the other. In a direction towards the middle of this vale we de&s;cended. The object of our pur&s;uit, was that celebrated cha&s;m, near Ca&s;tleton, called the <HI>Devil's cave.</HI></P>
<P>A de&s;cent of two miles brought us to it.&mdash; A combination of more horrid ideas is rarely
<PB N="214" REF="214">
found, than this place affords. It exceeded our livelie&s;t imagination.</P>
<P>A rocky mountain ri&s;es to a great height: in mo&s;t parts perpendicular; in &s;ome, beetling over it's ba&s;e. As it a&s;cends, it divides; forming at the top, two rocky &s;ummits.</P>
<P>On one of the&s;e &s;ummits &s;tands an old ca&s;tle; the battlements of which appear to grow out of the rock. It's &s;ituation, on the edge of a precipice, is tremendous. Looking up from the bottom, you may trace a narrow path, formed merely by the adventrous foot of cu|rio&s;ity, winding here and there round the walls of the ca&s;tle; which, as far as appears, is the only road, which leads to it.</P>
<P>The other rock re&s;erves it's terrors for the bottom. There it opens into that tremendous cha&s;m, called the Devil's cave. Few places have more the air of the poetical regions of Tartarus.</P>
<P>The combination of a ca&s;tle, and a cave, which we have here in <HI>reality,</HI> Virgil <HI>feigns</HI>&mdash; with a view perhaps of giving an additional terror to each.
<Q><L>&mdash;Aeneas arces, quibus altus Apollo</L>

The poet does not give the detail of his <HI>antrum immane:</HI> if he had, he could not have con|ceived more intere&s;ting circum&s;tances, than are here brought together.</P>
<P>A towering rock hangs over you; under which you enter an arched cavern, twelve yards high, forty wide, and near a hundred long. So va&s;t a canopy of <HI>unpillared</HI> rock &s;tretching over your head, gives you an involuntary &s;hud|der. A &s;trong light at the mouth of the cave, di&s;plays all the horrors of the <HI>entrance</HI> in full proportion. But this light decaying, as you proceed, the imagination is left to explore it's deeper caverns by torch-light, which gives them additional terror. At the end of the fir&s;t cavern runs a river, above forty feet wide, over which you are ferried into a &s;eeond, of dimen&s;ions va&s;ter than the fir&s;t. It is known by the name of the Cathedral. The height of it is horribly di&s;covered by a few &s;piracles at the top; through which you &s;ee the light of the day, without being able, at &s;uch a di&s;tance, to enjoy the lea&s;t benefit from it. Beyond this cavern flows another branch of the &s;ame river, which becomes the boundary of other caverns &s;till more remote. But this was farther than we cho&s;e to proceed. I never found any pictu|re&s;que

<Q>&mdash;coeli melioris ad auras.</Q>
<P>The inhabitants of the&s;e &s;cenes are as &s;avage as the &s;cenes them&s;elves. We were reminded by a di&s;agreeable contra&s;t of the plea&s;ing &s;im|plicity and civility of manners, which we found among the lakes and mountains of Cumberland. Here a wild, uninformed &s;tare, through matted, di&s;hevelled locks, marks every feature; and the traveller is followed, like a &s;pectacle, by a croud of gazers. Many of the&s;e mi&s;erable people live under the tremendous roof we have ju&s;t de&s;cribed; where a manufacture of rope-yarn is carried on. One poor wretch has erected a hut within it's verge, where &s;he has lived the&s;e forty years. A little &s;traw &s;uffices for a roof, which has only to re&s;i&s;t the drop|pings of unwhole&s;ome vapour from the top of the cavern.</P>
<P>The exit from Hope-dale, in our road to Buxton, is not inferior to the &s;cene we had
<PB N="217" REF="217">
left. We a&s;cend a &s;training &s;teep, ornamented on each &s;ide, with bold projecting rocks, mo&s;t of which are picture&s;que; tho &s;ome of them are rather fanta&s;tic.</P>
<P>As we leave this pa&s;s, on our right appears <HI>Mam-tor,</HI> &s;urnamed the <HI>Shivering mountain.</HI> A part of it's &s;ide has the appearance of a ca&s;|cade; down which it continually di&s;charges the flaky &s;ub&s;tance, of which it is compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the confines of this mountain, and but a little below the &s;urface, is found that curious, variegated mineral, which is formed into &s;mall ornamental obeli&s;ks, urns and va&s;es. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a petrifaction; and is known in London by the name of the <HI>Derby&s;hire drop.</HI> But on the &s;pot it is called <HI>Blue John,</HI> from the beautiful blue veins, which over&s;pread the fine&s;t parts of it. Where it wears a yellowi&s;h hue, the vein is coar&s;e&s;t: in many parts it is beautifully honeycombed, and tran&s;parent. The proprietors of the marble works at A&s;h|ford farmed the quarry of this curious mineral,
<PB N="218" REF="218">
la&s;t year, at ninety-five pounds; and it is thought have nearly exhau&s;ted it.</P>
<P>From Hope-dale to Buxton, the country is dreary, and uncomfortable. The eye ranges over bleak wa&s;tes, &s;uch as we had &s;een before, divided every where by &s;tone walls. The pa&s;|turage in many parts &s;eems good, as the fields were &s;tocked with cattle; but hardly a tree, or a hou&s;e appears through the whole di&s;trict.</P>
<P>In a bottom, in this uncomfortable country, lies Buxton, &s;urrounded with dreary, barren hills; and &s;treaming, on every &s;ide, with offen|&s;ive lime-kilns. Nothing, but ab&s;olute want of health, could make a man endure a &s;cene &s;o wholly di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>Near Buxton we vi&s;ited another horrid cave, called <HI>Pool's hole;</HI> but it wants tho&s;e magni|ficent accompaniments of <HI>external</HI> &s;cenery, which we found at the Devil's cave.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="219">The &s;ame dreary face of country continues from Buxton to A&s;hford. Here we fall into a beautiful vale fringed with wood, and watered by a brilliant &s;tream, which recalled to our memory the plea&s;ing &s;cenes of this kind we had met with among the mountains of Cum|berland.</P>
<P>At A&s;hford is carried on a manufactory of marble dug on the &s;pot; &s;ome of which, curiou&s;ly incru&s;ted with &s;hells, is very beau|tiful.</P>
<P>The vale of A&s;hford continues with little interruption to Bakewell, where it enters another &s;weet vale&mdash;the vale of Haddon; &s;o called from Haddon-hall, a magnificent old man&s;ion, which &s;tands in the middle of it, on a rocky knoll, incompa&s;&s;ed with wood.</P>
<P>This princely &s;tructure, &s;carce yet in a &s;tate of ruin, is able, it is &s;aid, to trace it's origin into times before the conque&s;t. It then wore a military form. In after ages, it became

po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by different noble families; and about the beginning of this century was inhabited by the dukes of Rutland. Since that time, it has been neglected. Many fragments of it's ancient grandeur remain&mdash;&s;culptured chim|nies; fretted cornices; patches of co&s;tly ta|pe&s;try;

<P>Chat&s;worth was the glory of the la&s;t age, when trim parterres, and formal water-works were in fa&s;hion. It <HI>then</HI> acquired a celebrity, which it has never lo&s;t; tho it has <HI>now</HI> many rivals. A good approach has been made to it; but in other re&s;pects, when we &s;aw it, it's invirons had not kept pace with the improve|ments of the times. Many of the old formali|ties remained. But a dozen years, no doubt, have introduced much improvement.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e it&s;elf would have been no way &s;triking; except in the wilds of Derby&s;hire. The chapel is magnificent. It is adorned, on

<P>There are few pictures in the hou&s;e. A portrait of the late duke of Cumberland by Reynolds was the be&s;t. But there is much exqui&s;ite carving by the hand of Gibbons. We admired chiefly the dead fowl of various kinds, with which the chimney of one of the &s;tate rooms is adorned. It is a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee the downy &s;oftne&s;s of feathers given to wood. The particulars however alone are admirable: Gib|bons was no adept at compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>From Chat&s;worth, through Darley-dale, a &s;weet, exten&s;ive &s;cene, we approached Matlock.</P>
<P>The rocky &s;cenery about the bridge is the fir&s;t grand &s;pecimen of what we were to expect.</P>
<P>As we advanced towards the boat-hou&s;e, the views became more intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Soon after the <HI>great Torr</HI> appeared, which is a mo&s;t magnificent rock, decorated with wood, and &s;tained with various hues, yellow, green, and grey.&mdash;On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, the rocks, contracting the road, &s;lope diagonally.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;traits open into the vale of Matlock; a romantic, and mo&s;t delightful &s;cene, in which
<PB N="222" REF="223">
the ideas of &s;ublimity and beauty are blended in a high degree. It extends about two miles in length; and in the wide&s;t parts is half a mile broad. The area con&s;i&s;ts of much irre|gular ground. The right hand bank has little con&s;equence, except that of &s;haping the vale. It is the left hand bank which ennobles the &s;cene. This very magnificent rampart, ri&s;ing in a &s;emi-circular form, is divided into four ample faces of rock, with an interruption of wood between each. The fir&s;t, which you approach, is the highe&s;t; but of lea&s;t extent: the next &s;preads more; and the third mo&s;t of all. A larger interruption &s;ucceeds; and the la&s;t, in compari&s;on of the others, &s;eems but a gentle effort. The whole va&s;t rampart is beautifully &s;haded with wood; which in &s;ome places, grows among the cliffs, garni&s;hing the rocks&mdash; in others, it grows wildly among tho&s;e breaks, and interruptions, which &s;eparate their &s;everal faces. The <HI>&s;ummit</HI> of the whole &s;emi-circular range is finely adorned with &s;cattered trees, which often break the hard lines of the rock; and by admitting the light, give an airine&s;s to the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="224">The river Derwent, which winds under this &s;emi-circular &s;creen, is a broken, rapid &s;tream. In &s;ome places only, it is vi&s;ible: in others, delving among rocks, and woody projections, it is an object only to the ear.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to view &s;uch &s;cenes as the&s;e, without feeling the imagination take fire.

But this is &s;cenery of a dif|ferent kind. Every object here, is &s;ublime, and wonderful. Not only the eye is plea&s;ed; but the imagination is filled. We are carried at once into the fields of fiction, and romance. Enthu&s;ia&s;tic ideas take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of us; and we &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves among the inhabitants of fa|bled times.&mdash;The tran&s;ition indeed is ea&s;y and natural, from romantic &s;cenes to romantic inhabitants,

<P>FROM A&s;hburn, which is among the larger villages, and &s;tands &s;weetly, we made an excur&s;ion to <HI>Dove-dale.</HI></P>
<P>Dove-dale is the continuation of another &s;imilar dale, which is &s;ometimes called <HI>Bun|&s;ter-dale;</HI> tho I believe both parts of the valley are known, except ju&s;t on the &s;pot, by the general name of Dove-dale.</P>
<P>Bun&s;ter-dale opens with a grand craggy mountain on the right. As you look up to the cliffs, which form the irregular &s;ides of this precipice, your guide will not fail to tell you the melancholy fate of a late digni|tary of the church, who riding along the top of it with a young lady, a Mi&s;s Laroche, behind him, and pur&s;uing a track, which
<PB N="228" REF="229">
happened to be only a &s;heep-path, and led to a declivity; fell in attempting to turn his hor&s;e out of it. He was killed: but the young lady was caught by a bu&s;h, and &s;aved. &mdash;A dreadful &s;tory is an admirable introduc|tion to an awful &s;cene. It rou&s;es the mind; and adds double terror to every impending rock.</P>
<P>The bare &s;ides of the&s;e lofty craggs on the right, are contra&s;ted by a woody mountain on the left. In the mid&s;t of the wood, a &s;ort of rocky-wall ri&s;es perpendicular from the &s;oil. The&s;e detached rocks are what chiefly characterize the &s;cene.&mdash;A little be|yond them, we enter, what is properly called, Dove-dale.</P>
<P>From the de&s;cription given of Dove-dale, even by men of ta&s;te, we had conceived it to be a &s;cene rather of curio&s;ity, than of beauty. We &s;uppo&s;ed the rocks were formed into the mo&s;t fanta&s;tic &s;hapes; and expected to &s;ee a gigantic di&s;play of all the conic &s;ections. But we were agreeably deceived. The whole compo&s;ition is cha&s;te, and picture&s;quely beau|tiful, in a high degree.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="230">On the right, you have a continuation of the &s;ame grand, craggy mountain, which ran along Bun&s;ter-dale; only the mountain in Dove-dale is higher, and the rocks &s;till more maje&s;tic, and more detached.</P>
<P>On the le&s;t, is a continuation al&s;o of the &s;ame hanging woods, which began in Bun|&s;ter-dale. In the mid&s;t of this woody &s;ce|nery ari&s;es a grand, &s;olitary, pointed rock, the characteri&s;tic feature of the whole &s;cene; which by way of eminence is known by the name of Dove-dale-church. It con&s;i&s;ts of a large face of rock, with two or three little &s;piry heads, and one very large one: and tho the form is rather peculiar, yet is it plea&s;ing. It's ri&s;ing a &s;ingle object among &s;urrounding woods takes away the fanta&s;tic idea; and gives it &s;ublimity. It is the multiplicity of the&s;e &s;piry heads, which makes them di&s;|gu&s;ting: as when we &s;ee &s;everal of them adorning the &s;ummits of alpine mountains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 83, Vol. I.</NOTE>. But a <HI>&s;olitary</HI> rock, tho &s;piry, has often a good effect. A picture&s;que ornament of this kind, marks a beautiful &s;cene, at a place
<PB N="230" REF="231">
called the <HI>New-Weir,</HI> on the banks of the Wye<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See ob&s;ervations on the Wye, page 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The colour of all the&s;e rocks is <HI>grey;</HI> and harmonizes agreeably with the verdure, which runs in large patches down their channelled &s;ides. Among all the picture&s;que accompa|niments of rocks there is nothing which has a finer effect in painting, than this variation and contra&s;t of colour, between the cold, grey hue of a rocky &s;urface, and the rich tints of herbage.</P>
<P>The valley of Dove-dale is very narrow at the bottom, con&s;i&s;ting of little more than the channel of the Dove, which is a con&s;i|derable &s;tream; and of a foot-path along it's banks. When the river ri&s;es, it &s;wells over the whole area of the valley; and has a fine effect. The grandeur of the river is then in full harmony with the grandeur of it's banks.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="232">Dove-dale is a calm, &s;eque&s;tered &s;cene; and yet not wholly the haunt of &s;olitude, and con|templation. It is too magnificent, and too intere&s;ting a piece of &s;cenery, to leave the mind wholly di&s;engaged.</P>
<P>The late Dr. Brown, comparing the &s;ce|nery here, with that of Ke&s;wick<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a letter to lord Lyttelton, already quoted.</NOTE>, tells us, that <HI>of the three circum&s;tances, beauty, horror, and immen&s;ity</HI> (by which la&s;t he means <HI>gran|deur) of which Ke&s;wick con&s;i&s;ts, the &s;econd alone is found in Dove-dale.</HI></P>
<P>In this de&s;cription he &s;eems, in my opinion, ju&s;t to have inverted the truth. It is difficult to conceive, why he &s;hould either rob this &s;cene of <HI>beauty,</HI> and <HI>grandeur;</HI> or fill it with <HI>horror.</HI> If <HI>beauty</HI> con&s;i&s;t in a plea&s;ing arrange|ment of plea&s;ing parts, Dove-dale has cer|tainly a great &s;hare of <HI>beauty.</HI> If <HI>grandeur</HI> con&s;i&s;t in large parts, and large objects, it has certainly <HI>grandeur</HI> al&s;o. But if <HI>horror</HI>
<PB N="232" REF="233">
con&s;i&s;t in the va&s;tne&s;s, of tho&s;e parts, it cer|tainly predominates le&s;s here, than in the re|gions of Ke&s;wick. The hills, the woods, and the rocks of Dove-dale are &s;ufficient to rai&s;e the idea of <HI>grandeur;</HI> but not to impre&s;s that of <HI>horror.</HI></P>
<P>On the whole, Dove-dale is perhaps one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pieces of &s;cenery of the kind we any where meet with. It has &s;ome|thing in it peculiarly characteri&s;tic. It's de|tached, perpendicular rocks &s;tamp it with an image intirely it's own: and for that rea|&s;on it affords the greater plea&s;ure. For it is in &s;cenery, as in life; we are mo&s;t &s;truck with the peculiarity of an original character; provided there is nothing offen&s;ive in it.</P>
<P>From Dove-dale we proceeded to Ilam; which is al&s;o a very characteri&s;tic &s;cene.</P>
<P>Ilam &s;tands on a hill, which &s;lopes gently in front; but is abrupt, and broken behind, where it is garni&s;hed with rock, and hanging wood. Round this hill &s;weeps a &s;emi-cir|cular valley; the area of which is a flat mea|dow,
<PB N="233" REF="234">
nearly a quarter of a mile in breadth, and twice as much in circumference. At the extremity of the meadow winds the channel of a river, con&s;iderable in it's dimen&s;ions; tho penuriou&s;ly &s;upplied with water: and be|yond all, &s;weeps a grand, woody bank, which forms a barrier to all the &s;cenery behind the hou&s;e; and yet, in the front, admits a view of di&s;tant mountains; particularly of that &s;quare-capt hill, called Thorp-cloud, which &s;tands near the entrance of Dove-dale.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the <HI>beauty</HI> of the &s;cene, we are pre&s;ented with a great <HI>curio&s;ity.</HI> The river <HI>Manifold</HI> formerly ran in that channel under the woody bank, which we ob&s;erved to be now &s;o penuriou&s;ly &s;upplied.&mdash;It has de&s;erted it's ancient bed; and about &s;even miles from Ilam, enters gradually the body of a moun|tain; under which it forces a way, and con|tinues it's &s;ubterraneous rout as far as the hill, on which Ilam &s;tands. There it ri&s;es from the ground, and forms a river in a bur&s;t. The channel under the bank is a &s;ort of wa&s;te-pipe to it; carrying off the &s;uperfluity of water, which in heavy rains cannot enter the mountain.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235">Curious this river certainly is: but were it mine, I &s;hould wi&s;h much to check it's &s;ubterraneous progre&s;s, and throw it into it's old channel. The o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zy bed, which is now a deformity, would then be an object of beauty, circling the meadow with a noble &s;tream.&mdash;Another deformity al&s;o would be avoided, that of cutting the meadow with two channels.&mdash;Or perhaps all ends might be an&s;wered, if the wa&s;te-&s;tream could be diverted. Then both the curio&s;ity; and, in a good degree, the beauty, would remain.</P>
<P>On the whole, we have few &s;ituations &s;o plea&s;ingly romantic, as Ilam. The rocky hill it &s;tands on; the ample lawn, which incir|cles it; the bold, woody bank, which in|virons the whole (where plea&s;ing walks might be formed) the bold incur&s;ion of the river; the views into the country; and the neigh|bourhood of Dove-dale, which lies within the di&s;tance of a &s;ummer-evening walk, bring together &s;uch a variety of uncommon, and beautiful circum&s;tances, as are rarely to be found in one place.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="236">Very little had been done, at Ilam, when we &s;aw it, to improve it's natural &s;ituation; tho it is capable of great improvement; par|ticularly in the front of the hou&s;e. There the ground, which is now a formal flower-garden, might ea&s;ily be united with the other parts of the &s;cenery in it's neighbourhood. It is now totally at variance with it.</P>
<P>In the higher part of the garden, under a rock, is a &s;eat dedicated to the memory of Congreve; where, you are told by your con|ductor, he compo&s;ed &s;everal of his plays.</P>
<P>From Ilam we went to Oakover to &s;ee the <HI>holy family</HI> by Raphael. As this picture is very celebrated, we gave it a minute examina|tion.</P>
<P>Whether it be an original, I am not critic enough in the works of Raphael to deter|mine. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, it is; and it were a pity to rob it of it's greate&s;t merit. No|thing, I think, but the character of the ma&s;ter could give it the reputation it holds. If it be examined by the rules of painting,
<PB N="236" REF="237">
it is certainly deficient. The manner is hard, without freedom; and the colouring black, without &s;weetne&s;s. Neither is there any har|mony in the whole. What harmony can ari&s;e from a conjunction of red, blue, and yellow, of which the draperies are compo&s;ed, almo&s;t in raw tints? Nor is the deficiency in the colouring, compen&s;ated by any har|mony in the light and &s;hade.</P>
<P>But the&s;e things perhaps we are not led to expect in the works of Raphael. In them we &s;eek for grace, drawing, character, and ex|pre&s;&s;ion. Here however they are not found<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since I made the&s;e remarks I was glad to &s;ee a kind of &s;anction given them by a great authority. Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, in one of his lectures, before the academy, &s;peaks very &s;lightly of the <HI>ea&s;el-pictures</HI> of Raphael; which, he &s;ays, give us no idea of that great ma&s;ter's genius.</NOTE>. The virgin, we allow to be a &s;weet, and lovely figure: but Jo&s;eph is inanimate; the boys are grinning &s;atyrins; and with regard to drawing, the right arm of Chri&s;t, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, is very faulty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since I made the&s;e remarks I was glad to &s;ee a kind of &s;anction given them by a great authority.

<P>On the whole, a holy family is a &s;ubject but indifferently adapted to the pencil. Un|le&s;s
<PB N="237" REF="238">
the painter could give the mother that <HI>cele&s;tial love;</HI> and the child, that <HI>divine com|po&s;ure, and &s;weetne&s;s,</HI> (which, I take it for granted, no painter can give,) the &s;ubject immediately degenerates into <HI>a mother, and a child.</HI> The <HI>actions</HI> of our Saviour's life may be good &s;ubjects for a picture: for altho the divine energy of the principal figure cannot be expre&s;&s;ed; yet the other parts of the &s;tory being well told, may &s;upply that deficiency. But in a holy family there is <HI>no action</HI>&mdash;no &s;tory told&mdash;the whole con&s;i&s;ts in the expre&s;|&s;ion of characters and affections, which we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e beyond conception. So that if the&s;e are not expre&s;&s;ed, the whole is nothing.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame room hang three or four pic|tures, any of which I &s;hould value more than the celebrated <HI>Raphael.</HI> There is a &s;mall picture, by Rubens, repre&s;enting the angels appearing to the women in the garden, which plea&s;ed me. The angels indeed are clum&s;ey figures; and dre&s;&s;ed like choiri&s;ters: but every other part of the picture, and the management of the whole, is good.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="239">In a large picture al&s;o of the unju&s;t &s;teward, the family in di&s;tre&s;s is well de&s;cribed: but on the whole, it is one of tho&s;e ambiguous pictures, on which we cannot well pronounce <HI>at &s;ight.</HI> One half of it &s;eems painted by <HI>Rubens;</HI> of the other half we doubted.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o in the &s;ame room two very capital <HI>Vanderveldts</HI>&mdash;a calm, and a &s;torm. Both are good: but the former plea&s;ed me better, than almo&s;t any picture by that ma&s;ter, I have any where &s;een.</P>

<P>FROM A&s;hburn, to which we returned from Oakover, we went, the next day, through a chearful, woody country, to Ked|dle&s;ton, the &s;eat of lord Scar&s;dale.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Keddle&s;ton, participates little of the romantic country, on which it borders. The hou&s;e &s;tands in a plea&s;ant park, rather bare of wood; but the deficiency is in a great degree compen&s;ated by the beauty of the trees; &s;ome of which are large, and noble. A &s;tream, by the help of art, is changed into a river, over which the road conducts you obliquely to the hou&s;e; forming a good ap|proach.</P>
<P>The architecture of Keddle&s;ton, as far as I could judge, is a compo&s;ition of elegance, and grandeur. The main body of the hou&s;e, which you enter by a noble portico, is joined, by a corridore on each &s;ide, to a hand&s;ome
<PB N="240" REF="241">
wing. In the back front, the &s;aloon, which is a rotunda, appears to advantage. From the hall lead the &s;tate rooms, which are not many. The re&s;t of the hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of excellent offices, and comfortable apartments; and the plan of the whole is ea&s;y, and intelligible.</P>
<P>The hall is perhaps one of the grande&s;t, and mo&s;t beautiful private rooms in England. The roof is &s;upported by very noble columns; &s;ome of which are intire blocks of marble, dug, as we were informed, from lord Scar&s;|dale's own quarries. It is rather indeed a &s;purious &s;ort of marble; but more beautiful, at lea&s;t in colour, than any that is imported. There is a richne&s;s, and a variety in it, that plea&s;es the eye exceedingly: the veins are large, and &s;uited to columns; and a rough poli&s;h, <HI>by receiving the light in one body,</HI> gives a noble &s;well to the column; and adds much to it's beauty.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw this grand room, I thought it wanted no farther decoration. All was &s;imple, great, and uniform, as it ought to be. Since that time I have heard the doors, and windows have been painted, and varni&s;hed in the cabinet &s;tyle. I have not &s;een the&s;e alterations; and cannot pronounce on their merit: but I am
<PB N="241" REF="242">
at a lo&s;s to conceive, that any further embel|li&s;hment could add to the effect.</P>
<P>The <HI>entrance</HI> of a great hou&s;e, &s;hould, in my opinion, con&s;i&s;t only of that kind of beauty, which ari&s;es merely from &s;implicity and gran|deur. The&s;e ideas, as you proceed in the apart|ments, may detail them&s;elves into ornaments of various kinds; and, in their proper places, even into prettine&s;&s;es. Alien, mi&s;placed, am|bitious ornaments, no doubt, are <HI>every where</HI> di&s;gu&s;ting: but in the <HI>grand entrance</HI> of a hou&s;e, they &s;hould <HI>particularly</HI> be avoided. A fal&s;e ta&s;te, di&s;covered there, is apt to pur&s;ue you through the apartments; and throw it's colours on what may happen to be good.&mdash;I &s;hould be unwilling however to &s;uppo&s;e, that any improper decorations are added to the hall at Keddle&s;ton; as the ornaments of the hou&s;e, in general, when I &s;aw it, &s;eemed to be under the conduct of a cha&s;t and elegant ta&s;te. Tho every thing was rich; I do not recollect, that any thing was tawdry, trifling, or affected.</P>
<P>The pictures, of which there is a con&s;ider|able collection, are chiefly, what may be called good <HI>furniture pictures</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 24, Vol. I.</NOTE>. A Rembrandt is
<PB N="242" REF="243">
the fir&s;t in rank; and is indeed a valuable piece. It repre&s;ents <HI>Daniel interpreting Bel|te&s;hazzar's dream.</HI> There is great amu&s;ement in this picture. It is highly fini&s;hed; and the heads are particularly excellent. For the re&s;t, it is a &s;cattered piece, without any idea of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>In the drawing-room are two large uprights by Benedetto Lutti; one repre&s;enting the la&s;t &s;upper; the other the death of Abel. They are painted in a &s;ingular manner with &s;trong lights. The former has a good effect. The death of Abel is likewi&s;e a &s;hewy picture; but has nothing very &s;triking in it, except the figure of Cain.</P>
<P>In the dead game by Snyders, there is a good fawn; but the picture is made di&s;agree|able by the <HI>glaring</HI> tail of a peacock.</P>
<P>In the dead game and dogs, by Fyt, there are good <HI>pa&s;&s;ages,</HI> but no <HI>whole.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>woman of Samaria,</HI> and <HI>St. John in the wilderne&s;s,</HI> by B. Stiozzi, are good pictures.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a large Coyp, well-painted; but badly compo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="244">At Derby, which lies within three miles of Keddle&s;ton, we were immediately &s;truck with the tower of the great church, which is a very beautiful piece of Gothic architecture.</P>
<P>The object of the china-works there is merely ornament; which is particularly unhappy, as they were, at the time we &s;aw them, under no regulation of ta&s;te. A very free hand we found employed in painting the va&s;es; and the fir&s;t colours were <HI>laid in</HI> with &s;pirit: but in the <HI>fini&s;hing,</HI> they were &s;o richly daubed, that all freedom was lo&s;t in finery.&mdash;It may now be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The gaudy painters however of &s;uch works, have the example of a great ma&s;ter before them, even Raphael him&s;elf; who&s;e paintings in the pottery way, tho highly e&s;teemed in the cabi|nets of the curious, &s;eem generally to be daubed in a manner fit only <HI>ad captandum vulgus.</HI> It is &s;aid, that Raphael fell in love with a potter's daughter; and that to plea&s;e her, he painted
<PB N="244" REF="245">
her father's di&s;hes. It is probable therefore, that he &s;uited them to her ta&s;te; which ac|counts for the gaudy colouring they di&s;play.&mdash; How much more &s;imple, elegant, and beautiful is the painting of the old Etru&s;can va&s;es, many of which Mr. Wedgewood has &s;o happily imi|tated? There we &s;ee how much better an effect is produced by cha&s;t colours on a dark ground; than by gaudy colours, on a light one.</P>
<P>A per&s;on curious in machinery would be much amu&s;ed by the &s;ilk-mill at Derby, in which thirty thou&s;and little wheels are put in motion by one great wheel. The various parts, tho &s;o complicated in appearance, are yet &s;o di&s;tinct in their movements; that I was told, any one workman has the power of &s;topping that part of the machinery, which is under his direction, without interrupting the motion of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The country between Derby and Leice&s;ter is flat. Quardon-wood, a little beyond Lough|borough, ri&s;ing on the right, makes an agree|able variety, amid&s;t &s;uch a continuation of
<PB N="245" REF="246">
uniformity. Mount Sorrel al&s;o has the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>The approach to Leice&s;ter gives it more con|&s;equence than it really has. The town it&s;elf, old and incumbered, has little beauty: but it abounds with fragments of antiquity.</P>
<P>Behind St. Nicholas's church is a piece of Roman architecture; one of the only <HI>pure</HI> pieces perhaps in England. We &s;ee many towers, which go by the name of Cae&s;ar; and boa&s;t of Roman origin. I doubt, whether any of them can boa&s;t it with truth. And what few <HI>remnants</HI> we have, it is thought, have all been retouched in after times. This fragment &s;eems to have &s;uffered no alteration. It's in&s;ignificance has &s;ecured it. Little more is left, than a wall, with four double arches on it's face, retiring, but not perforated. And yet in this trifling remnant there is a &s;implicity and dignity, which are very plea&s;ing. It is po&s;&s;ible however that prejudice may in part, be the &s;ource of it's beauty. Through an a&s;&s;o|ciation
<PB N="246" REF="247">
of ideas, we may here be plea&s;ed with what we have admired in Italian views.</P>
<P>This wall is built of brick; tho it has pro|bably been faced with better materials. For what purpo&s;e it was con&s;tructed, does not appear: nor whether it was intended for the end, or &s;ide of a building. The idea of the country is, that it has been a temple, from the great number of bones of animals, which have been found near it: from whence it takes the name of <HI>Holy-bones.</HI></P>
<P>The church of St. Nicholas, which &s;tands oppo&s;ite to it, &s;eems to have been built out of it's ruins, from the many Roman bricks with which it abounds. Indeed the &s;tyle of building, in the body of the church, is not unlike it.</P>
<P>At Leice&s;ter al&s;o we were put on the pur&s;uit of another Roman fragment&mdash;a curious piece of &s;culpture; which we found at la&s;t in a cel|lar. It is a &s;crap of te&s;&s;ulated pavement, on which three figures are repre&s;ented; a &s;tag; a woman leaning over it; and a boy &s;hooting
<PB N="247" REF="248">
with a bow. It may be a piece of Roman antiquity; but it is a piece of mi&s;erable work|man&s;hip.</P>
<P>In this ancient town are found al&s;o many ve&s;tiges of Briti&s;h antiquity.&mdash;From &s;o rich an endowment as the abbey of Leice&s;ter for|merly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, we expected many beautiful remains; as it is &s;till in a kind of &s;eque&s;tered &s;tate: but in that expectation we were di&s;ap|pointed. Not the lea&s;t fragment of a Gothic window is left: not the mere&s;t mutilation of an arch. It's pre&s;ent remains afford as little beauty, as the ruins of a common dwelling. And in all probability the pre&s;ent ruin is no|thing better, than a common dwelling; built from the materials of the ancient abbey. Such at lea&s;t is the tradition of the place. It be|longed formerly, we were told, to the family of Ha&s;tings; and was lo&s;t at play to the earl of Devon&s;hire: but before the conveyance was prepared; the owner, in the &s;pirit of revenge, and mortification, &s;ent private orders to have it burnt.&mdash;Many a black tale might be un|folded in mo&s;t old hou&s;es, if walls could &s;peak.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="249">But the great &s;tory of this abbey has a vir|tuous tendency. Within it's walls was once exhibited a &s;cene more humiliating to human ambition, and more in&s;tructive to human grandeur, than almo&s;t any, which hi&s;tory hath produced. Here the fallen pride of Wool&s;ey retreated from the in&s;ults of the world. All his vi&s;ions of ambition were now gone; his pomp; and pageantry; and crouded levees. On this &s;pot he told the li&s;tening monks, the &s;ole attendants of his dying hour, as they &s;tood around his pallet, that he was come to lay his bones among them: and gave that pathetic te&s;timony to the truth, and joys of religion, which preaches beyond a thou&s;and lectures. "If I had &s;erved God as faithfully as I &s;erved the king, he would not thus have for&s;aken my old age."</P>
<P>The death of Wool&s;ey would make a fine moral picture; if the hand of any ma&s;ter could give the pallid features of the dying &s;tate&s;man that chagrin, that remor&s;e, tho&s;e pangs of
<PB N="249" REF="250">
angui&s;h, which, in the&s;e la&s;t bitter moments of his life, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>The point might be taken, when the monks are admini&s;tring the comforts of religion, which the de&s;pairing prelate cannot feel. The &s;ubject requires a gloomy apartment; which a ray through a Gothic window might ju&s;t en|lighten; throwing it's force chiefly on the principal figure; and dying away on the re&s;t. The appendages of the piece need only be few, and &s;imple; little more than the crozier, and red hat, to mark the cardinal, and tell the &s;tory.</P>
<P>This is not the only piece of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, which is illu&s;trated in this ancient town.&mdash; Here the hou&s;e is &s;till &s;hewn, where Richard III pa&s;&s;ed the night, before the battle of Bo&s;|worth: and there is a &s;tory of him, &s;till pre&s;erved in the <HI>corporation-records,</HI> as we were informed by our conductor, (who did not however appear to be a man of deep eru|dition) which illu&s;trates the caution and dark|ne&s;s of that prince's character.&mdash;It was his cu&s;tom to carry, among the baggage of his camp, a cumber&s;ome, wooden bed, which he
<PB N="250" REF="251">
pretended was the only bed he could &s;leep in. Here he contrived a &s;ecret receptacle for his trea&s;ure, which lay concealed under a weight of timber. After the fatal day, on which Richard fell, the earl of Richmond entered Leice&s;ter with his victorious troops. The friends of Richard were pillaged; but the bed was neglected by every plunderer, as u&s;ele&s;s lumber.&mdash;The owner of the hou&s;e afterwards di&s;covering the hoard, became &s;uddenly rich, without any vi&s;ible cau&s;e. He bought lands; and at length (as our intelligencer informed us) arrived at the dignity of being mayor of Leice&s;ter. Many years afterwards, his widow, who had been left in great affluence, was murdered for her wealth by a &s;ervant maid, who had been privy to the affair: and at the trial of this woman, and her accomplices, the whole tran&s;action came to light.</P>

<P>FROM Leice&s;ter the country &s;till conti|nues flat and woody; &s;tretching out into meadows, pa&s;tures, and common fields. The horizon, on every &s;ide, is generally terminated by &s;pires. Oftener than once we were able to count &s;ix, or &s;even adorning the limits of one circular view.</P>
<P>Of all the countries in England, this is the place for that noble &s;pecies of diver&s;ion, to which the inventive genius of our young &s;port&s;|men hath given the name of <HI>&s;teeple-hunting.</HI> In a dearth of game, the cha&s;&s;ieurs draw up in a body, and pointing to &s;ome con&s;picuous &s;teeple, &s;et off, in full &s;peed towards it, over hedge and ditch. He who is &s;o happy, as to arrive fir&s;t, receives equal honour, it is &s;aid,
<PB N="252" REF="254">
as if he had come in foremo&s;t, at the death of the fox.</P>
<P>In the&s;e plains, as rich, as they are unpic|ture&s;que, we had nothing to ob&s;erve, but the numerous herds of cattle, and flocks of &s;heep, which graze them: and in the deficiency of other objects, we amu&s;ed our&s;elves with the various forms of the&s;e animals, and their mo&s;t agreeable combinations.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e, in it&s;elf, is certainly a nobler animal, than the cow. His form is more elegant; and his &s;pirit gives fire and grace to his actions. But in a <HI>picture&s;que light</HI> the cow has undoubtedly the advantage; and is every way better &s;uited to receive the graces of the pencil.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, the lines of the hor&s;e are round and &s;mooth; and admit little va|riety: whereas the bones of the cow are high, and vary the line, here and there, by a &s;quare|ne&s;s, which is very picture&s;que. There is a greater proportion al&s;o of concavity in them; the lines of the hor&s;e being chiefly convex.</P>
<P><PB REF="255"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="256">But is not the lean, worn-out hor&s;e, who&s;e bones are &s;taring, as picture&s;que as the cow? In a degree it is; but we do not with plea|&s;ure admit the idea of beauty into any deficient form. Prejudice, even in &s;pite of us, rather revolts again&s;t &s;uch an admi&s;&s;ion, however picture&s;que.</P>
<P>Nor are the lines only of the cow more picture&s;que, it has the advantage al&s;o in the filling up of tho&s;e lines. If the hor&s;e be &s;leek e&s;pecially, and have, what the jockies call, a <HI>fine coat,</HI> the &s;moothne&s;s of the &s;ur|face is not &s;o well adapted to receive the &s;pirited touches of the pencil, as the rougher form and coat of the cow. The very action of licking her&s;elf, which is &s;o common among cows, throws the hair, when it is long, into different feathery flakes; and gives it tho&s;e &s;trong touches, which are indeed the very touches of the pencil.&mdash;Cows are commonly the mo&s;t picture&s;que in the months of April, and May, when the old hair is coming off. There is a contra&s;t between the rougher, and
<PB N="254" REF="257">
&s;moother parts of the coat; and often al&s;o a plea&s;ing variety of greyi&s;h tints, blended with others of a richer hue. We ob&s;erve this too in colts, when we &s;ee them in a &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>But the cow is not only better adapted to receive the &s;pirited touches of the pencil, it is better adapted al&s;o to receive the beauties of light. The hor&s;e, like a piece of &s;mooth garden-ground, receives it in a gradual &s;pread: the cow, like the abruptne&s;s of a rugged country, receives it in bold catches. And tho in <HI>large objects</HI> a <HI>gradation</HI> of light is one of the great &s;ources of beauty; yet, in a <HI>&s;mall object,</HI> it has not commonly &s;o plea&s;ing an effect, as ari&s;es from <HI>&s;mart, catching lights.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>colour</HI> of the cow al&s;o is often more picture&s;que. That of the hor&s;e is generally uniform. Whereas the tints of the cow fre|quently play into each other; a dark head melting into lighter &s;ides; and the&s;e again being &s;till darker than the hinder parts. Tho&s;e are always the mo&s;t beautiful, which are thus
<PB REF="258">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="255" REF="259">
tinted with dark colours, harmoniou&s;ly &s;teal|ing into lighter. Here and there a few &s;mall white &s;pots may add a beauty; but if they run into large blotches, and make a har&s;h termi|nation between the dark, and light colour, they are di&s;agreeable. The full black al&s;o, and full red, have little variety in <HI>them&s;elves;</HI> tho in a <HI>group</HI> all this unplea&s;ant colouring may harmonize.</P>
<P>In the <HI>character,</HI> and <HI>general form</HI> of cows, as well as of hor&s;es, there are many degrees of beauty and deformity.</P>
<P>The <HI>character</HI> of the cow is marked chiefly in the head. An open, or contracted fore|head; a long or a &s;hort vi&s;age; the twi&s;t of a horn; or the colour of an eyebrow; will totally alter the <HI>character,</HI> and give a &s;our, or an agreeable air to the countenance. Nor is the head of this animal more characteri&s;tic, than it is adapted to receive all the graces of the pencil.</P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>general form</HI> of the cow, we are not indeed &s;o exact, as in that of the hor&s;e. The points and proportions of the hor&s;e are &s;tudied, and determined with
<PB N="256" REF="260">
&s;o much exactne&s;s, that a &s;mall deviation &s;trikes the eye. In the form of the cow, we are not &s;o learned. If <HI>deformity</HI> be avoided, it is enough. There are two faults particu|larly in the line of a cow, a <HI>hog-back,</HI> and a <HI>&s;inking rump,</HI> which are it's mo&s;t u&s;ual ble|mi&s;hes. If it be free from the&s;e, and have an harmonious colouring, and a plea&s;ant cha|racter, it cannot well be di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>The <HI>bull</HI> and the <HI>cow</HI> differ more in <HI>character</HI> and <HI>form,</HI> than the hor&s;e and the mare. They are ca&s;t in <HI>different moulds.</HI> The &s;ourne&s;s of the head; the thickne&s;s and convexity of the neck; the heavine&s;s of the che&s;t, and &s;houl|ders; the &s;moothne&s;s of the hip-bones; and the lightne&s;s of the hind-quarters, are always found in the bull; and rarely in the cow.</P>
<P>The &s;heep is as beautiful an animal, as the cow; and as well adapted to receive the graces of painting. Tho it want the variety of co|louring; yet there is a &s;oftne&s;s in it's fleece, a richne&s;s, a delicacy of touch, and a &s;weet
<PB N="257" REF="261">
tenderne&s;s of &s;hadow, which make it a very plea&s;ing object.</P>
<P>The &s;heep is beautiful in every &s;tate, except ju&s;t when it has pa&s;t under the &s;heers. But it &s;oon recovers it's beauty; and in a few weeks lo&s;es it's furrowed &s;ides, and appears again in a picture&s;que dre&s;s. It's beauty continues, as the wool increa&s;es. What it lo&s;es in &s;hape, it gains in the feathered flaki|ne&s;s of it's fleece. Nor is it the lea&s;t beau|tiful, when it's &s;ides are a little ragged&mdash; when part of it's &s;hape is di&s;covered, and part hid beneath the wool. Berghem de|lights to repre&s;ent it in this ragged form.</P>
<P>In the <HI>characters,</HI> and <HI>forms</HI> of &s;heep we ob&s;erve little difference. We &s;ometimes &s;ee an unplea&s;ing vi&s;age; and &s;ometimes the di&s;|agreeable rounding line, which we have ju&s;t called the hog-back: but in an animal &s;o &s;mall, the eye is le&s;s apt to inve&s;tigate <HI>parts:</HI> it rather re&s;ts on the <HI>whole appearance;</HI> and the more &s;o, as &s;heep, being particularly gre|garious, are generally con&s;idered as objects in a group.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="262">The ob&s;ervations I have made with regard to the beauty of the&s;e animals, are confirmed by the practice of all the great ma&s;ters in ani|mal life, Berghem, Coyp, Potter and others; who always preferred them to hor&s;es and deer, in adorning their rural &s;cenes.&mdash;It is an ad|ditional plea&s;ure therefore, that &s;uch animals, as are the mo&s;t u&s;eful, are likewi&s;e the mo&s;t ornamental.</P>
<P>Having thus examined the <HI>forms</HI> of the&s;e picture&s;que animals, we &s;pent &s;ome time al&s;o in examining their mo&s;t agreeable <HI>combina|tions.</HI></P>
<P>Cattle are &s;o large, that when they orna|ment a fore-ground, a few are &s;ufficient. Two will hardly combine. Three make a good group&mdash;either united&mdash;or when one is a little removed from the other two. If you increa&s;e the group beyond three; one, or more, in proportion, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a <HI>little detached.</HI> This detachment prevents hea|vine&s;s, and adds variety. It is the &s;ame prin|ciple
<PB REF="263">

applied to cattle, which we before ap|plied to mountains, and other objects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 55, Vol. II. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rules in grouping may be applied to <HI>di&s;tant cattle;</HI> only here you may introduce a greater number.</P>
<P>In grouping, contra&s;ted attitudes &s;hould be &s;tudied. Recumbency &s;hould be oppo&s;ed to a &s;tanding po&s;ture; fore-&s;hortened figures, to lengthened; and one colour, to another. White blotches may inliven a group, tho in a &s;ingle animal, we ob&s;erved, they are offen|&s;ive.</P>
<P>Sheep come under the &s;ame rules; only the <HI>fore-ground,</HI> as well as the <HI>di&s;tance,</HI> ad|mits a larger number of the&s;e &s;maller ani|mals. In pa&s;toral &s;ubjects &s;heep are often ornamental, when <HI>dotted about</HI> the &s;ides of <HI>di&s;tant</HI> hills. Here little more is nece&s;&s;ary, than to guard again&s;t regular &s;hapes&mdash;lines; circles; and cro&s;&s;es; which large flocks of &s;heep &s;ometimes form. In combining them however, or, rather &s;cattering them, the
<PB N="260" REF="266">
painter may keep in view the principle, we have already &s;o often inculcated. They may be huddled together, in one, or more large bodies; from which little groups of different &s;izes, in proportion to the larger, &s;hould be detached.</P>
<P>In favour of the doctrine I have here ad|vanced of the <HI>&s;ubordinate group,</HI> I cannot forbear adding the authority of a great ma&s;ter, who&s;e thorough acquaintance with every part of painting hath often, in the cour&s;e of this work, been ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Aeneas, on his landing upon the coa&s;t of Africa, &s;ees from the higher ground a herd of deer feeding in a valley; and Virgil, who, in the &s;lighte&s;t in&s;tance, &s;eems ever to have had before his eyes, ideas of picture&s;que beauty, introduces the herd, ju&s;t as a painter would have done. From the <HI>larger group</HI> he de|taches a <HI>&s;ubordinate one:</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash; <HI>Tres</HI> litore cervos</L>
<L>Pro&s;picit errantes; hos <HI>tota armenta</HI> &s;equuntur</L>
<L>A tergo. &mdash;</L></Q>
I need not conceal, that &s;ome commentators have found in the&s;e three &s;tags, which the

followed, the poet's inclination to ari&s;to|cracy; and that others have &s;uppo&s;ed, he meant a compliment to the triumvirate. It is the commentator's bu&s;ine&s;s to find out a recondite meaning: common &s;en&s;e is &s;atisfied with what is mo&s;t obvious.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved further, that <HI>cattle</HI> and <HI>&s;heep</HI> mix very agreeably <HI>together;</HI> as al&s;o <HI>young</HI> animals, and <HI>old.</HI> Lambs and calves fill up little inter&s;tices in a group, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the com|bination.&mdash;I may add, that <HI>human figures</HI> al&s;o combine very agreeably with <HI>animals.</HI> Indeed they generally give a grace to a group, as they draw it to an <HI>apex.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;carce need to apologize for this long digre&s;&s;ion, as it is &s;o naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by the country, through which we pa&s;&s;ed; and &s;o clo&s;ely connected with the &s;ubject, which we treat.

<P>LEAVING the plains of Leice&s;ter&s;hire, we entered the county of Northampton, which a&s;&s;umes a new face. The ground begins to ri&s;e and fall, and di&s;tances to open.</P>
<P>Lord Strafford's gardens, extending a con|&s;iderable way on the left, are a great ornament to the country.</P>
<P>Lord Hallifax's improvements &s;ucceed. They make little appearance from the road: but the road it&s;elf is &s;o beautiful, that it requires no aid. It pa&s;&s;es through &s;pacious lanes, adorned on each &s;ide by a broad, irregular border of gra&s;s; and winds through hedge-rows of full-grown oak, which the &s;everal turns of the
<PB N="264" REF="271">
road form into clumps. You have both a good fore-ground, and beautiful views into a fine country, through the boles of the trees. The undre&s;&s;ed &s;implicity, and native beauty, of &s;uch lanes as the&s;e, exceed the walks of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed garden.</P>
<P>From Newport-Pagnel the country &s;till continues plea&s;ant. Before we reach Wooburn, we have a good view of Wooburn-abbey, and of the &s;urrounding woods; which deco|rate the land&s;cape.</P>
<P>Wooburn-park is an exten&s;ive woody &s;cene, and capable of much improvement. We rode through it: but could not &s;ee the duke of Bedford's hou&s;e; which is &s;hewn only on particular days.&mdash;But the di&s;appointment was not great. The <HI>furniture</HI> of all fine hou&s;es is much the &s;ame; and as for pictures (&s;uch is the prevalence of <HI>names,</HI> and fa&s;hion) that &s;ometimes what are called the be&s;t collections, &s;carce repay the ceremonies you are obliged to go through in getting a &s;ight of them.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="272">After we leave Wooburn, the views con|tinue &s;till plea&s;ant; till we meet the chalky hills of Dun&s;table. The&s;e would disfigure the lovelie&s;t &s;cene. But when we have pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e glaring heights, the country revives: the ri&s;ing grounds are covered with wood, and verdure; and the whole looks plea&s;ing. About Redburn particularly the country is beautiful; and is thrown into di&s;tance by large oaks, which over-hang the road.</P>
<P>St. Albans' church, and the ruins about it, make an immen&s;e pile; of which &s;ome parts are picture&s;que. There is a mixture too of brick and &s;tone in the building, which often makes a plea&s;ing contra&s;t in the tints. Tho there are many remains of beautiful Gothic in this church; there are more deformities of Saxon architecture; particularly the tower, which is heavy, and di&s;agreeably ornamented. The little &s;pire, which ari&s;es from it, is very ab&s;urd.&mdash;Within the church is a monument near the altar, of very curious Gothic work|man&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="273">Among the numerous inhabitants of the &s;ubterraneous regions of this church, lies that celebrated prince, remembered by the name of good duke Humphrey; the younge&s;t bro|ther of Henry V. He was put to death by a faction, in the &s;ucceeding reign; and was buried &s;omewhere in this abbey; but his grave was unknown. Having lain concealed near three centuries, he came again to light, not many years ago. By an accident, a large vault was di&s;covered, in which he was found &s;ole tenant; wrapped in lead, and immer&s;ed in a pickle, which had pre&s;erved him in tole|rable order.</P>
<P>Leaving St. Alban's, we pa&s;t the ruins of Verulam; which was rai&s;ed in Roman times, and de&s;troyed in Saxon. As it was never re&s;tored, very little now remains of that ancient town. In one part, about a quarter of a mile from the road, a fragment has the appearance of an old ca&s;tle; but the ve&s;tiges of the wall run at lea&s;t a mile.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="274">Beyond Verulam the country grows plea&s;ant. Soon after you pa&s;s Barnet, the road enters Finchley-common. The di&s;tance is woody, inter&s;ected by an exten&s;ive plain, which is connected with it by a &s;prinkling of &s;cattered trees. The parts are large; and the &s;cenery not unpicture&s;que.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t view of Highgate-hill would make a good di&s;tance, if it were properly &s;upported by a fore-ground. The view <HI>from</HI> it, is very grand; but is di&s;tracted by a multiplicity of objects.</P>
<P>After this, the country is gone. London comes on apace; and all tho&s;e di&s;gu&s;ting ideas, with which it's great avenues abound&mdash;brick-kilns &s;teaming with offen&s;ive &s;moke&mdash;&s;ewers and ditches &s;weating with filth&mdash;heaps of col|lected &s;oil, and &s;tinks of every denomination&mdash; clouds of du&s;t, ri&s;ing and vani&s;hing, from agi|tated wheels, pur&s;uing each other in rapid mo|tion&mdash;or taking &s;tationary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the

road, by becoming the atmo&s;phere of &s;ome cumber&s;ome, &s;low-moving waggon&mdash;villages without rural ideas&mdash;trees, and hedge-rows without a tinge of green&mdash;and fields and mea|dows without pa&s;turage, in which lowing bullocks are crouded together, waiting for the &s;hambles; or cows penned, like hogs, to feed on grains.&mdash;It was an agreeable relief to get through this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of noi&s;ome objects, which did violence to all the &s;en&s;es by turns: and to leave behind us <HI>the bu&s;y hum of men;</HI> &s;tealing from it through the quiet lanes of Surry; which leading to no great mart, or general rendezvous, afford calmer retreats on every &s;ide, than can ea&s;ily be found in the neighbourhood of &s;o great a town.</P>

<LIST>
<ITEM>PAGE 39. THIS view of Warwick-ca&s;tle, is in&s;erted chiefly as an illu&s;tration of what hath been advanced in the preface (&s;ee page xxv) that a <HI>faithful portrait is rarely in every part beautiful.</HI> Nothing can be more di&s;agreeable to the eye, than the cap repre&s;ented here upon the round tower; and the &s;quarene&s;s, and for|mality of the remoter parts of the building: tho in other &s;ituations Warwick-ca&s;tle affords many plea&s;ing views; &s;ome of which, with a little
<PB N="ii" REF="277">
alteration on the fore-grounds (&s;ee preface, page xxvii) would be very picture&s;que.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 69. A &s;pecimen of the elegant mode, in which handles are adapted to Tu&s;can va&s;es; and the awkward manner in which they are commonly affixed to tho&s;e of modern con&s;truction.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 83. An explanation of the &s;hapes and lines of mountains. They are left un&s;hadowed, that their forms may be more con&s;picuous.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 95. An illu&s;tration of the appearance, which the &s;hores of a lake form, when &s;een <HI>from its &s;ur|face, in a boat.</HI> The promontories, and bays, unle&s;s very large, lo&s;e all their indentations; and the whole boundary of the lake becomes a mere thread. When you &s;tand <HI>upon the &s;hore,</HI> if your &s;itu|ation be, in any degree, elevated, the promon|tories appear to come forward; and all the indentations are di&s;tinct. The&s;e two modes of viewing may be compared by turning from this print to page 55, vol. II;
<PB N="iii" REF="278">
in which is repre&s;ented a lake &s;een <HI>from the &s;hore.</HI> This latter mode of viewing a lake is generally the mo&s;t plea&s;ing; unle&s;s indeed the &s;tand be taken too high, which elevates the horizon too much.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 99. This print is meant to exemplify tho&s;e beau|tiful reflections, which are &s;ometimes formed on the &s;urface of a lake; and broken by it's tremulous motion; as explained in page 100.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 113. The <HI>contracted valley</HI> may be con&s;idered as a &s;pecies of fore-ground. The valley here repre|&s;ented, opens rather too abruptly. There is more beauty in this kind of land&s;cape, when the <HI>removed &s;creen</HI> folds more behind the <HI>front one;</HI> and the di&s;tance appears over the inter|&s;ecting point. The&s;e &s;cenes are generally deco|rated with a river; but &s;ometimes only with a road. Of this latter kind is Middleton-dale, de&s;cribed in the 212th page of the IId vol. The <HI>contracted valley</HI> is contra&s;ted by the open, <HI>extended vale;</HI> a &s;cene of which kind is repre&s;ented in the 41&s;t page of the IId vol.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="iv" REF="279">PAGE 123. An illu&s;tration of the <HI>effect of light;</HI> which is &s;o great, as to give con&s;equence even where there are no objects. A &s;etting &s;un; or a &s;torm, (as here repre&s;ented) are mo&s;t favourable to an exhibition of this kind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 135. This plan of Windermere is not geographi|cally exact; but enough &s;o to give the reader an idea of it's &s;hape, and the &s;ituation of the &s;everal places mentioned on it's &s;hores.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 135. This view of the middle part of Windermere, is taken from the grounds a little to the north of Bowne&s;s. The di&s;tance, as the reader will ob&s;erve from the plan, is compo&s;ed of that country, which &s;hoots away towards the &s;outh. The high grounds make a part of Furne&s;s-fell; which is de&s;cribed, in page 143, &s;tretching along the we&s;tern &s;hores of the lake towards the north.&mdash;Below Furne&s;s-fell appear &s;ome of the i&s;lands of the lake, particularly the great i&s;land; which is the mo&s;t &s;outhern of them.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="v" REF="280">PAGE 157. This is a view of that part of Furne&s;s-abbey, which is called the <HI>&s;chool;</HI> and which is one of the mo&s;t beautiful fragments of that elegant ruin.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 163. An illu&s;tration of that kind of wild country, of which we &s;aw &s;everal in&s;tances, as we en|tered Cumberland. In general, the mountains make the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the&s;e &s;cenes. But when any of them is furni&s;hed with a di&s;tant view of a lake, the land&s;cape is greatly inriched.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 179. This plan of Ke&s;wick-lake means only to expre&s;s the general &s;hape of it; and the relative &s;ituation of it's &s;everal parts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 187. The character of that &s;ort of rocky &s;cenery is here given, which is not uncommonly found on the banks of lakes, particularly of Ke&s;wick lake; the &s;hores of which exhibit &s;everal in|&s;tances of the&s;e detached rocks.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="vi" REF="281">PAGE 193. An illu&s;tration of that &s;ort of country, which compo&s;es the narrower parts of the &s;traits of Borrodale. They con&s;i&s;t of rocky, or craggy mountains on each &s;ide; with a &s;tream, or, in &s;ome parts (where the &s;tream may be hid) a road, in the middle. But it is difficult to give any idea of the&s;e tremendous &s;cenes, in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s, as they are here exhibited: for as their terror con&s;i&s;ts greatly in their immen&s;ity, it is not ea&s;y to per&s;uade the eye to conceive highly of their grandeur from the&s;e diminutive repre&s;entations.&mdash;Mr. Farrington has given us, on a larger &s;cale, a fine portrait, and I think, a very exact one, of the entrance into the&s;e &s;traits at the village of Grange.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 227. This print was intended to give &s;ome idea of that kind of rocky &s;cenery, of which Gates|garth-dale is compo&s;ed; and of that &s;olemnity, which it a&s;&s;umed, when we &s;aw the &s;weeping clouds pa&s;s over it's &s;ummits: but I am &s;orry to &s;ay, it does not expre&s;s the idea &s;o well as I could wi&s;h. The proofs of this print e&s;caped me too &s;oon. Indeed I thought it had been
<PB N="vii" REF="282">
brought nearer my idea, than I find it is. The clouds are ill made-out: the di&s;tant rocks are wor&s;e; and the figures, as a &s;cale to the per&s;pective, are twice as large as they ought to be.&mdash;With the&s;e hints, however, I hope the imagination of the &s;pectator may not be mi&s;led by the deficiences of the print.</ITEM>

<ITEM>PAGE 41. AN illu&s;tration of that beautiful &s;pecies of land&s;cape, produced by an <HI>exten&s;ive vale.</HI> Gradation is among the fir&s;t principles of pic|ture&s;que beauty. A graduating light, a gradu|ating &s;hade, or a graduating di&s;tance, are all beautiful. When the vale therefore does not exceed &s;uch a proportion, as is adapted to the eye, it is plea&s;ing to &s;ee it fading away gradu|ally, from the fore-ground, into the ob&s;curity of di&s;tance. It pre&s;ents indeed only <HI>one uniform</HI> idea; which, tho often <HI>grand,</HI> is not generally &s;o <HI>plea&s;ing,</HI> as the variety, and intricacy of a country broken into parts, and yet harmoni|ou&s;ly combined.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="x" REF="284">PAGE 51. This plan of Ulle&s;water, like the others, is not very exact; but enough &s;o, to give an idea of it's general &s;hape, and the relative &s;ituation of the &s;everal places on it's &s;hores.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 55. This print illu&s;trates that kind of &s;cenery, which is pre&s;ented by Ulle&s;water. It is, by no means, a portrait: but it gives &s;ome idea of the view towards Patterdale, in which the rocky promontory on the left, and the two woody promontories on the right, are con&s;pi|cuous features.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 85. This view has more the air of Dacre-ca&s;tle, than of any of the other old ca&s;tles we met with: but it is chiefly introduced to &s;hew the beautiful effect which &s;ome of the&s;e ruins had, when &s;een, under a gloomy hemi&s;phere, in|lightened by the rays of a &s;etting &s;un.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 121. A view of Scaleby-ca&s;tle, in which the old tower, part of the walls, and the ba&s;tion, are repre&s;ented.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="ix" REF="285">PAGE 169. An illu&s;tration of the force of contra&s;t, in a piece of regular ground, bi&s;ected.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 221. This print is meant to give &s;ome idea of that kind of continuation of rocky &s;cenery, which is found at Matlock, along the banks of the Derwent: but it is not &s;o good an illu&s;|tration, as might be wi&s;hed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 227. This view of <HI>Dovedale,</HI> repre&s;ents that beau|tiful &s;cene in a more naked &s;tate, than it is de&s;cribed. The &s;tratum of it only is here repre&s;ented, which the &s;pectator's imagination mu&s;t cloath with wood, to give it compleat beauty.&mdash;The fact is, a little gain unluckily ari&s;es from di&s;mantling it periodically of it's wood; and this drawing was made, ju&s;t after the axe had been at work.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 251. An illu&s;tration of that kind of <HI>flat country,</HI> which we meet with in Leice&s;ter&s;hire. The horizon is generally bounded by a di&s;tance,
<PB N="xii" REF="286">
and yet &s;eldom an exten&s;ive one; as there is rarely a ri&s;ing ground, that can command it. The country is unintere&s;ting, and wants ad|ventitious objects to &s;et it off. If the di&s;tance happen to be &s;pread with light under a dark cloud, it is a happy circum&s;tance; and has a good effect. Sometimes, on the middle grounds, a gentle ri&s;e, adorned with a &s;pire; or a &s;hep|herd attending his flock, may relieve the eye. Such circum&s;tances are all we can expect. In defect of the&s;e, we mu&s;t wait, till we can find a few cattle on the fore-ground, which may turn the <HI>land&s;cape</HI> into an <HI>appendage;</HI> and give us one of the pictures of Coyp.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 253. This print exhibits a compari&s;on between the lines of the hor&s;e and the cow, as objects of picture&s;que beauty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 255. And this exhibits the &s;ame mode of com|pari&s;on between the bull, and the cow.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 259. The&s;e two prints are meant to explain the doctrine of grouping <HI>larger cattle. Two</HI> will
<PB N="xiii" REF="287">
hardly combine. There is indeed no way of forming <HI>two</HI> into a group, but by <HI>uniting</HI> them, as they are repre&s;ented in the former of the&s;e prints. If they &s;tand apart, what|ever their attitudes, or &s;ituation may be, there will be a deficiency. But with <HI>three,</HI> you are almo&s;t &s;ure of a good group, except indeed they all &s;tand in the &s;ame attitude, and at equal di&s;tances. They generally however combine the mo&s;t beau|tifully, when two are <HI>united,</HI> and the third a little <HI>removed.</HI>
<HI>Four</HI> introduce a new difficulty in grouping. <HI>Separate</HI> they would have a bad effect. Two, and two together would be equally bad. The only way, in which they will group well, is to <HI>unite three,</HI> as repre&s;ented in the &s;econd of the&s;e prints, and to <HI>remove the fourth.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>PAGE 261. The&s;e two prints illu&s;trate the doctrine of grouping <HI>&s;maller animals,</HI> as &s;heep, goats, and deer. When they occupy the <HI>fore-ground,</HI> as repre&s;ented in the fir&s;t, they come under the &s;ame rule of grouping, as larger cattle: only a greater number may be introduced.
<PB N="xiv" REF="288">
And if the main body be larger, the &s;ubordi|nate group mu&s;t be &s;o of cour&s;e. If they be removed to a <HI>middle di&s;tance,</HI> as repre&s;ented in the other of the&s;e prints, the &s;ubordinate group is of le&s;s con&s;equence; and &s;till of le&s;s, the farther it recedes from the eye. The whole is only con&s;idered as one body, blended, as it were, and &s;hadowed, or inlight|ened, with the ground: and it is enough, if regular, and di&s;agreeable &s;hapes are avoided.</ITEM>

<P>In page the 11th, &amp;c. the author endeavours to &s;hew, that the art of painting con&s;i&s;ts rather in giving the &s;trong characteri&s;tic touches of nature, than in mi|nutely detailing her beauties, by <HI>high fini&s;hing.</HI> Since he wrote that pa&s;&s;age, he met with, in a work of Dr. John&s;on's, the application of the &s;ame rules to poetry.
