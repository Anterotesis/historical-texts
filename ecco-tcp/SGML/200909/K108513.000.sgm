<HEAD>THE Preface <HI>to the</HI> Reader; And Particularly to <HI>Mariners</HI> and other <HI>Seafaring-Men.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THO' God's Wonders are every where vi&s;ible, and his Mercies no where hid from the Eyes of Man; yet more par|ticularly are they Evident to <HI>Seafaring-Men,</HI> who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is in the Great Waters, and their Lives expo&s;ed more than others to Innu|merable Hazards and Dangers, of <HI>Contend|ing Winds</HI> and <HI>Seas, Rocks, Quick-&s;ands,</HI> and <HI>Inho&s;pitable Shores:</HI> The&s;e, as it were, carry their Lives in their Hands, and their be&s;t Security is wholly to rely on the Provi|dence and Protection of him <HI>who&s;e Power the Wind and the Waves obey:</HI> Seeing there is &s;o &s;mall a Partition between them and Eternity, the Striking on a treacherous <HI>Rock,</HI> over which many times the Flatter|ing Waves &s;moothly glide, gives them their.

Nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this all their Danger, the Springing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Plank, a Leak not to be found, nor &s;udden|ly &s;topt, running on a Shoal, or the falling of a Water-&s;pout, frequently carry with them the &s;ame Inevitable Fate, and often makes them at their Wits End before they en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their Lives; for a certain Pro&s;pect of Una|voidable Death mu&s;t needs be Terrible to Fle&s;h and Blood, and, in a great mea&s;ure, remove that Con&s;tant Pre&s;ence of Mind that &s;hould &s;upport their Spirits amid&s;t all Dan|gers: From this there is no way to &s;ecure them&s;elves, but by laying hold on him that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mighty, and able to &s;ave to the utmo&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> God, who is a pre&s;ent help at need, who&s;e Eyes are in all Places, in Heaven and Earth, and in the great <HI>Deep;</HI> and tho&s;e that Cry t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him in their Di&s;tre&s;s, he will &s;urely hear them and deliver them out of all their Troubles, if they are &s;incere in Heart, and walk uprightly with him.

<PB REF="5">on God in all their Dangers, nay at all times, for that is the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t Anchor hold and Security that recour&s;e to can be had, and therefore I have furni&s;hed this Book with ma|ny Wonderful and Remarkable <HI>Sea-Delive|rances,</HI> to &s;how them that their Hopes are not in vain; for the Wonders he has already wrought, he will doubtle&s;s continue to all that fear and put their Tru&s;t in him.</P>
<P>This <HI>Collection</HI> is taken mo&s;tly from the Mouths of tho&s;e who have experienc'd God's Mercy this way, and who&s;e Dangers have been as great as any could be on this &s;ide the Grave; yet God, in his Mercy, delivered them out of all. The re&s;t are taken from &s;uch Reverend <HI>Authors,</HI> that their Credit and Integrity is indi&s;putable, being purpo&s;ely writ|ten to rai&s;e the Minds of Men to contem|plate and adore the Love and Goodne&s;s of the All wi&s;e Creator of the Univer&s;e, and may indifferently &s;erve to this end as well at <HI>Land</HI> as <HI>Sea,</HI> though chiefly intended for <HI>Sea-fa|ring</HI> Men, to put them in Mind, when they read it, of their Danger, and what they may expect in their Danger from the Death they apprehend in it, if they apply their Hearts to true Wi&s;dom. When all Help or Hopes fail or &s;eem to be at a lo&s;s, then fix your Hearts and Eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly on him who is able to do all things, and to whom nothing is impo&s;&s;ible; on him, in who&s;e Hands is all the
<PB REF="6">Breath of Life, who can &s;top the Shafts of Death in their winged Motion, check the Bel|lowing Thunder in the Mid Volley, and turn the Raging of the Winds to a &s;udden Calm.</P>
<P>But not to be tedious in a <HI>Preface;</HI> I re|commend this to you, as a &s;uitable Compa|nion in your Voyages or Travels, nay in your Hou&s;es, or at all times, that you may know the&s;e things are the <HI>Lord's doing tho' they are Marvellous in your Eyes.</HI> And &s;o conclude, &s;ub&s;cribing my &s;elf,</P>

<P>ONE Major <HI>Gibbons,</HI> a Man well known in <HI>New England,</HI> a Gen|tleman of good Education, good Parts, and of good Conver&s;ation, (as the Author hath been credibly inform'd by them that knew him) was bound upon a Voyage to Sea, him&s;elf being <HI>Super Cargo</HI> with &s;uch Commodities as tho&s;e Parts of <HI>America</HI> affords, after going out from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> &s;everal days, by hard Weather, and contrary Winds, the Ships Company were much di&s;tre&s;s'd, and by the Continuance of contrary Winds, Provi&s;ions now begin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o fail them; and O how feeble do Spi|rits grow, when Bread, the &s;taff of Life fails!

<PB N="2" REF="8">Ocean; and they that one while fear'd drowning, now fear &s;tarving; they are brought to the la&s;t meal in the Barrel, and the la&s;t oyl in the Cru&s;e, and &s;ay, <HI>We will Eat this little that is left and dye:</HI> And now when they thought they had eaten the la&s;t, what conflicts mu&s;t they needs have within them&s;elves, who knew not where to have another mor&s;el to fortifie their tired and &s;pent Spirits with the con&s;tant toil, and hard labour? How they look one upon another, as men already under a Sentence of Death? And by one ano|thers Looks, &s;trike terror to one anothers Hearts; They look on every &s;ide, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 142. 4, 5. (<HI>as David</HI> &s;ays) <HI>I looked on my right hand, but there was no man that would know me; Refuge failed me,</HI> or peri&s;hed from me.

<P>But tho' they look out of the Ship, as <HI>Noah</HI> did out of his Ark, upon the waters and &s;end forth the Dove of Prayer, that winged Me&s;&s;enger, to Heaven, yet &s;he brings no.

Is it not Death to them now, to think who &s;hall act this bloody part in the Tragedy? But before they fall upon their involuntary Executi|on, Major <HI>Gibbons</HI> calls them to Prayer, con&s;idering, that in the Moment the Lord is often &s;een, and that many times our Ex|tremity
<PB N="4" REF="10">proves God's Opportunity; he al&s;o asks the poor Man if he was willing to die; but O what a hard Que&s;tion is that to An&s;wer! He replies, <HI>if it might pre&s;erve the re&s;t of the Lives, he could be the more willing;</HI> to which he hath this An|&s;wer; <HI>All Events are in the hands of God, we mu&s;t not di&s;pute them;</HI> to Prayer they go; and, O &s;ure the&s;e Prayers mu&s;t melt hearts of Adamant! and Behold, while they are at it, God &s;ends a vi&s;ible Commentary up|on that Scripture, <HI>E&s;a.</HI> 58.9. <HI>Then &s;halt thou call, and the Lord &s;hall An&s;wer; thou &s;halt Cry, and he &s;hall &s;ay here I am:</HI> For while they were calling, God was an|&s;wering; there leaps a mighty Fi&s;h into the Boat; and as it is &s;aid of the Whale that &s;wallowed up <HI>Jonah, God prepared a Fi&s;h,</HI> &s;o the Lord here prepared or pro|vided a Fi&s;h, that a poor creature might not be &s;wallowed up: But O what joy was here at &s;uch a token for good! it not only at pre&s;ent relieving and refre&s;hing their Hunger, which no Que&s;tion made them quick Cooks; but when they look'd upon the Finger of God in it, &s;ending it as an an&s;wer to Prayer, they conclude it an happy Omen of their Deliverance, and a pledge of approaching Mercy: but alas, it is not long before their Hearts grew faint again, their Countenances pale,
<PB N="5" REF="11">their Spirits &s;ink now as low as they were lifted up high; and now the poor Seamen are like their Ship, one while mounted up in hopes to Heaven, and another while they are &s;unk down again in de&s;pair as low as Hell; they know not now of another Cake, another Mor&s;el, they are reduc'd to their former Exigency, which brings them to a re&s;olve to &s;teer in this &s;trait their old cour&s;e; to Lots they go again the &s;econd time, only they have &s;uch an Honour for the Providence of God, they will not put him into condemnation, that God hath acquitted; the Lot now falls upon another Per&s;on, and O now they re|ceive the old trouble, and inte&s;tine Com|bats, how they &s;hall find in their Hearts, to puni&s;h one, that never had offended any of them; and while one thinks of it, &s;ays he, <HI>Alas poor Man, what hath he done to de&s;erve this Sentence?</HI> another crys, <HI>Will not this Blood cleave to my Con&s;cience another day; tho' I went to this expedition a Pre&s;t Soldier?</HI> another &s;ays, <HI>for his part he fees no way but Death, therefore he cannot take away Life, when he &s;ees not any Life can be pre&s;erved by it:</HI> but they are call'd again to look up|ward, before they put the Knife to the Throat of this Sacrifice, and they remem|ber the la&s;t Encouragement to put Life into almo&s;t the Dead-mens Prayers; they
<PB N="6" REF="12">pray now with a pledge in their Hands, and are ready to tell God, the la&s;t time he gave them a Pawn, an Earne&s;t; and O it is not in vain to &s;eek the Lord. For lo, while they are &s;eeking to him, he is &s;end|ing to them; as the Prayers fly to Hea|ven, Mercy is di&s;patch'd upon the wing from Heaven.</P>
<P>O turn a&s;ide, and &s;ee this great &s;ight, while they are praying! Behold a &s;econd An&s;wer from above! A great Bird lights and fixes her &s;elf upon the Ma&s;t, which one in the Company e&s;pies, and up he goes and there he &s;tands till he took her with his Hand by the wing, and brought her down to the Company; and O what life from the dead is this to them a &s;econd time! Sure they will hearken to the voice of the &s;econd Sign, if not to the voice of the fir&s;t; and now that which they hoped by the fir&s;t Providence <HI>(viz.)</HI> that it was a fore-runner of their compleat Deli|verance; Now they are by this &s;econd con|firm'd in the Faith, and now they begin to think (as I can ea&s;ily imagine) if God will &s;ave them out of this di&s;tre&s;s, O what manner of Per&s;ons they will become! what manner of Lives they will live! what Sacrifices of Thank&s;giving they will offer up to God! but while they are thus think|ing they have no vi&s;ible hopes, but that it
<PB N="7" REF="13">mu&s;t be a third Miracle that brings them out of this their mi&s;erable condition; they have the &s;ame di&s;appointments upon them &s;till, only now they divert their Hunger all they can, by telling of, and remem|bring the Loaves, (as I may &s;ay) their experiences in this extremity of theirs, and comforting them&s;elves, that if they come to a third &s;trait, it would (they ho|ped) be an outlet from their pre&s;ent Mi|&s;ery and Calamity: They are reduc'd the third time to their former cour&s;e and &s;trait, to ca&s;t Lots; and when they were to go to the Heart-aking work, to put him to Death, upon whom the Lot fell, they go to their Old Friend, in a day of Adver&s;ity, (to God) by hearty and hum|ble Prayer; And O now they do, as the Prophet's Man at the Sea &s;ide, look again and again, but alas Ma&s;ter they cry, <HI>there is nothing.</HI> Prayer is done, concluded, no|thing appears; O but as the Prophet's Man looked &s;even times, &s;o &s;ays this good Man Major <HI>Gibbons,</HI> look again, as <HI>Jonah, I will look again towards his Holy Temple,</HI> (&s;ays he to one of the Company) <HI>Go up to the top, and &s;ee what you can e&s;py;</HI> and at la&s;t he makes a Sail, <HI>(viz.)</HI> e&s;pies a Ship; this put new life into all their &s;pirits; they bear up with the Ve&s;&s;el, they Man their Boat, they de&s;ire, in the manner of
<PB N="8" REF="14">peri&s;hing humble Suppliants, to board them, which they are admitted; the Ve&s;|&s;el proves a <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, yea, a <HI>French</HI> Pirate; Major <HI>Gibbons</HI> petitions him for a little Bread to &s;u&s;tain their Lives, who had been &s;everal days wi&s;hing for Death, but could not find it in their extremity; and to take the Ship and Cargo. So &s;weet is Life, that <HI>all that a Man hath will he give for his Life;</HI> and now behold, God draws forth to the poor Peri&s;hing Men his be&s;t Wine at the la&s;t, nay, turns the Water of Affliction into the Wine of Con&s;olation. The Commander of the Ve&s;&s;el knows the Major, and replies readily and chearful|ly, Major <HI>Gibbons,</HI> not one hair of your. Head &s;hall peri&s;h, nor any of your Ships Company, if it lie in my power either to &s;upply you, or pre&s;erve you.

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> About the Year 1636. there ari&s;ing a Storm and Tempe&s;t of troubles in the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> five Mini&s;ters, eminent for Piety, Learning, and their Honourable &s;ucce&s;s in the Mini&s;try, were &s;o hard born under by a prevailing Party impo&s;ing upon their Con&s;ciences, that they were forc'd to Embarque them&s;elves for <HI>America;</HI> three of their Names were Mr. <HI>Levin&s;ton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Mackleland,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Blaire,</HI> with two more whom my Au|thor could not call to mind.</P>
<P>The&s;e good Men &s;ailed half the Chan|nel over, about 500 Leagues, where they met with great di&s;tre&s;s of Weather, which broke off the Rudder of their Ship, and occa&s;ioned a de&s;perate Leak to &s;pring in her, which expos'd them to imminent dan|ger; but they in this di&s;tre&s;s endeavour to hang on their Rudder again, but often were they fru&s;trated in their attempt, to a total de&s;pair of effecting it. They al&s;o laboured with the like un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s to find out and &s;top the Leak; this poor Ships Crew had labour'd al&s;o by pumping to keep the Ship above Water, until all their few Hands were feeble, and all their Hearts faint; &s;o that as &s;o many <HI>de&s;pair|ing Per&s;ons</HI> of Life, they cea&s;e all endea|vours,
<PB N="10" REF="16">and yield them&s;elves to Death, ex|pecting every Moment to be Entombed in the Belly of the Devouring Deep; during the time of this their great Di|&s;tre&s;s, the Mini&s;ters kept on their cour&s;e, as at other times of Wor&s;hip, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the reading of a Chapter in cour&s;e, and taking ob&s;ervations from it, with Prayers and Preaching, which they did by turns; at the cri&s;is of this deplorable ca&s;e, it fell to be the Lot of Mr. <HI>Mackleland</HI> to per|form this Exerci&s;e, a Man Au&s;teer in his Life, re&s;erv'd in his Speech, and of great Piety, who was often ob&s;erv'd to let fall many remarkable Prophetical Expre&s;&s;ions of future Events; the Chapter that at that time came to be read in cour&s;e by him, was the 23 of <HI>Exodus,</HI> which he had read all along (until he came to the 12th <HI>ver&s;e</HI>) where he made a full &s;top; the ver&s;es run thus;</P>
<P><HI>And</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>be&s;ought the Lord his God, and &s;aid, Lord, why doth thy Wrath wax hot again&s;t thy People, which thou ha&s;t brought out of the Land of</HI> Egypt <HI>with great Power, and a mighty Hand? Wherefore &s;hould the Egyptians &s;ay, for mi&s;chief did he bring them out to &s;lay them in the Mountains, and to con|&s;ume them from the face of the Earth? Turn from thy &s;evere Wrath, and repent of this E|vil again&s;t thy People,</HI>&mdash; upon the reading
<PB N="11" REF="17">of the&s;e ver&s;es over again, he declared to them, the Ca&s;e which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was here in|terceeding for, compared with his Expo|&s;tulation in the 12 ver&s;e, did parallel their ca&s;e, and con&s;idering the happy Event of that Argument which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> u&s;ed (men|tioned in the 14 ver&s;e, which runs thus:) <HI>and the Lord repented of the Evil which he thought to do unto his People</HI>&mdash;he could not but comfortably hope, that they might have the &s;ame Effect: Nay he goes fur|ther, and his Spirit was rai&s;ed into a pe|remptory prediction, that he dur&s;t a&s;&s;ure them from his great Lord and Ma&s;ter, that not one Hair of his Head &s;hall fall to the ground; after this he went to Prayer, urging God with the &s;ame Argument, and then ro&s;e up comfortably, a&s;&s;uring his &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s in believing the &s;ame; he advi&s;es the Seamen and the Company in the Ship to refre&s;h them&s;elve by taking &s;ome Meat, the long fa&s;ling and hard labour having much infeebled them. Then he encouraged them to make ano|ther attempt to fa&s;ten the Rudder, with|out which they could not po&s;&s;ibly make towards any Point for Shore. He after advi&s;ed them to clear the Ship, as well as they could, from Water by Pumping, which they did happily effect, the Leak being &s;topt providentially of it &s;elf,&mdash;
<PB N="12" REF="18">whether it was &s;ome noak of a Plank &s;tarted by the di&s;tre&s;s of Weather which occa&s;ion'd the Leak, and by the &s;urges of the Sea, clapt into the place again, or what it was el&s;e could not be known. But however this looks like Life from the Dead to the&s;e poor Men, who had received but a little before Sentence of Death in them&s;elves, that they might tru&s;t in him who rai&s;eth the Dead. Soon after this, God who had heard in Hea|ven their Tears and Prayers, Commands the Wind to Tack about to the We&s;t, and to blow &s;o &s;trong a Gale that they were forc'd to bear up before it, and it continued &s;o long, that it brought them back to the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where they continued &s;ome time, altho' but &s;hort, they were very in&s;trumental in the Con|verting of many Souls, which &s;eed-plot remains to this Day; and &s;oon after they pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>Scotland.</HI> This Relation was given by &s;everal Mini&s;ters of the North of <HI>Ireland:</HI> al&s;o the Reader may take no|tice, the Author of that Book called the <HI>Fulfilling of the Scriptures,</HI> page 487. men|tions this remarkable Providence, tho' not &s;o largely, with the&s;e two additional, but very con&s;iderable circum&s;tances; fir&s;t, That a poor Seaman was made the in|&s;trument to pre&s;erve the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el, by

The&s;e Men ta|king with them a Brace of Dogs, a Snap|hance, two Lances, and a Tnider-Box went on Shore, and that day they laid Fourteen Good Deer on the Ground: And then, being weary, and the Night

<P>In this Pa&s;&s;age they killed Eight Deer more, and &s;o having laden their Shallop with Veni&s;on, they kept on their cour&s;e to <HI>Green Harbour:</HI> But when they came thither, they found, to their great A&s;to|ni&s;hment, that the Ship was departed.

<P>But after a Space, knowing that Delay in Extremity is the Mother of all Dan|ger, they began to conceive Hope out of the Depth of De&s;pair; and therefore they con&s;ulted together of the likelie&s;t Cour&s;e for their Pre&s;ervation in that Place, and re&s;olv'd upon the Opportu|nity of the next fair Weather to go to

<PB N="59" REF="65">befel them: The Wind blowing hard into the <HI>Cove,</HI> and their Anchor coming home, their Shallop &s;unk into the <HI>Sea,</HI> and &s;o wet all their Provi&s;ion, and &s;ome of it they found &s;wimming up and down by the &s;hoar: The &s;ight thereof, won|derfully troubled them, to &s;ee the be&s;t part of their Provi&s;ion, the only hope of their Lives under God, in danger either utterly to be lo&s;t, or to be &s;poil'd by the <HI>Sea-water,</HI> for which they had taken &s;uch pains, and run &s;o many adventures in the getting of it: and in this their Mi&s;ery, they &s;aw but one remedy, and that was a de&s;perate one, <HI>viz.</HI> to turn into the high|wrote <HI>Sea</HI> to their Shallops to &s;ave the re|mainder of their Provi&s;ions, now ready to be wa&s;h'd away by the Billows: This they did, and by main force drew the Shallops to the &s;hore; then they went a|long by the <HI>Sea-&s;ide</HI> to gather up &s;uch of their Provi&s;ions as were &s;wimming up and down: and when the Weather prov'd fair, they went on to <HI>Bell-&s;ound:</HI> where being arriv'd, they took out their Provi|vi&s;ion, and viewed the great Tent which was built of Timber and Boards, and co|vered with <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Tiles: The u&s;e of it was for the <HI>Coopers</HI> to Work and Lodge in whil&s;t they made Casks for the putting up of the Train-Oyl; and they re&s;olved to
<PB N="60" REF="66">build another &s;maller Tent within that for their Habitations; and accordingly, taking down a le&s;&s;er Tent that &s;tood near to it, wherein the Land-men lay whil&s;t they made their Oyl, they fetch'd their materials from thence, both Boards, Po&s;ts, and Rafters, and from the Chimnies of the Furnaces, they took a thou&s;and Bricks; they found al&s;o four Hog&s;heads of Lime, which mingled with &s;and from the &s;hoar, made good Mortar; But the Weather was grown &s;o extream cold, that they were fain to make 2 Fires on both &s;ides, to keep their Mortar from freezing; then they rai&s;ed a Wall of one Brick thickne&s;s again&s;t the inner Planks of the &s;ide of the Tent, but by that time they had Wall'd 2 &s;ides of their Hou&s;e, their Bricks fail'd, &s;o that they were forc'd to build the other 2 &s;ides of Boards; which be|ing nail'd on both &s;ides the Po&s;ts, they were hollow between, which they fill'd up with Sand, that made it &s;o tite, that the lea&s;t breath of Air could not po&s;&s;ibly annoy them. The length of this Tent was 20 foot, and the breadth 16; their Chimney was the breadth of a Deal|board, and 4 foot high; they Ciel'd it with Boards of 5 or 6 times double, that no Wind could po&s;&s;ibly get thro': The Door they made as clo&s;e as they could,
<PB N="61" REF="67">and lin'd it with a Bed that they found there, which came over both the open|ing and &s;hutting of it: they made no Windows, having no light but what came thro' the Chimney: then &s;et they up 4 Cabins, quartering them&s;elves two and two in a Cabin; their Beds were the Deer-skins dry'd, which was a warm and comfortable Lodging for them in their Di&s;tre&s;s: Their next care was for Firing, and finding 7 old Shallops which were un&s;erviceable, they brake them up, and &s;tow'd them over the beams of the great Tent to make it the warmer, and to keep the Snow from driving thro' the Tiles into the Tent: and by this time the cold increa&s;ing, and &s;carce having any Day at all, they &s;tav'd &s;ome emp|ty Cask, and brake two old Coolers (wherein they cool their Oyl) provid|ing what&s;oever Firing they could with|out prejudice to the next Years Voyage: yet con&s;idering the &s;mall quantity of Fewel, the extremity of Cold, and the long time of their aboad, they Husband|ed it as thriftily as po&s;&s;ibly they could.</P>
<P>Having thus fitted every thing in the be&s;t manner they could, on the 12 of <HI>Sept.</HI> looking out into the Sound, they e&s;py'd 2 Sea-Hor&s;es lying a Sleep on a piece of Ice, whereupon, taking up an
<PB N="62" REF="68">old harping-iron, they ha&s;ten'd to them, and fir&s;t &s;lew the old one, and the the young,; and &s;o bringing them a&s;hore, they flay'd them, roa&s;ted, and eat them. Not long after they kill'd another; but the Nights and cold. Weather increa&s;ing on them, and they viewing their Provi|&s;ion, found it too &s;mall by half; where|upon they &s;tinted them&s;elves to one rea|&s;onable Meal a day, and agreed to fa&s;t <HI>Wedne&s;days</HI> and <HI>Fridays,</HI> excepting from the Greaves and Fritters of the Whale (which was a very loath&s;ome Meat) of which they allow'd them&s;elves &s;ufficient for their pre&s;ent Hunger: at which Diet they continu'd for about 3 Months.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed whatever they could invent for their Pre&s;ervation; they found that all their Clothes and Shoes were worn, and torn; to repair which, they had this new device, of Rope-yarn they made Thread, and of Whale-bones Needles to &s;ow their Clothes withal: But <HI>Octob.</HI> 10. the Nights being grown very long, and the Cold &s;o violent, that all the Sea was Frozen over; and they having now nothing to exerci&s;e their Minds upon, were troubled with a thou|&s;and imaginations: Sometimes they be|wail'd <HI>their ab&s;ence from their Wives and Children, thinking what grief it would be to
<PB N="63" REF="69">them to hear of their mi&s;carriage:</HI> then <HI>they thought of their Parents, and what a cutting corro&s;ive it would be to them to hear of their untimely Deaths,</HI> &amp;c. And being tormented in their Minds with Fear, and Grief, and pinched in their Bodies with Hunger, and Cold, the hideous Mon&s;ter of De&s;peration, pre&s;ented his uglie&s;t &s;hape unto them: But thinking it not be&s;t to give way to Grief and Fear, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y doubled their <HI>Prayer</HI> to <HI>Al|mighty God</HI> for Strength and Patience in their Mi&s;eries, by who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance, they &s;hook off their former Thought, and chear'd up them&s;elves to u&s;e the be&s;t means for their pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Then for the pre&s;ervation of their Veni&s;on, and lengthening of their Fire|ing, they thought be&s;t to roa&s;t every day half a Deer, and to &s;tow it in Hog&s;|heads, which accordingly they did, leav|ing &s;o much raw as would &s;erve to roa&s;t every <HI>Sabbath day</HI> a quarter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And when this was over, they began again to think of their en&s;uing Mi&s;ery, that in ca&s;e God &s;hould give them Life, yet they were to live as Bani&s;hed Men from all Company; and as if their Sorrows had been too little, they pre&s;ently found an increa&s;e of it; for their Whale-Frit|ters, after they had been drench'd in the
<PB N="64" REF="70"><HI>Sea-water,</HI> lying clo&s;e together, were grown mouldy, and &s;poiled: And again &s;urveying their Bear and Veni&s;on, they found that it would not afford them five Meals a Week, whereupon they were fain to cut off one Meal more; &s;o that for three Months after, four days in the Week they fed upon the un&s;avory moul|dy Whale-Fritters, and the other three they fea&s;ted with Bear and Veni&s;on: But be&s;ide the want of Meat, they now be|gan to want Light, &s;o that all their Meals were Suppers: For, from <HI>Octob.</HI> 10, to <HI>Febr.</HI> 3. the never &s;aw the Sun &s;o much as peep above the Horizon: But th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Moon, when not ob&s;cur'd with Clouds they always &s;aw &s;hining as bright as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>England:</HI> All which dark&s;ome time, they could not certainly tell when it &s;hould be Day, and when Night.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this darkne&s;s, they &s;ought &s;ome means to pre&s;erve Light, and finding a piece of Sheet-Lead, and &s;ome Oyl in the Coopers Tent, and Rope-yarn they made a Lamp, which they kept con|tinually burning, which was a great com|fort to them in their extremity; yet their Wants and Mi&s;eries were &s;o many, and great, that &s;ometimes they brake forth into impatient Speeches again&s;t the cau|&s;ers of them, but then their Con&s;ciences a|gain
<PB N="65" REF="71">minded them after their own <HI>Evil de&s;erts,</HI> and &s;o they took it as a ju&s;t Hand of God for their former wicked Lives; or that God intended to make them Exam|ples of his Mercy in their wonderful deli|verance: <HI>Humbling them&s;elves therefore un|der the mighty Hand of God, they pro&s;trated them&s;elves in Prayer two or three times a day,</HI> which cour&s;e they con&s;tantly held all the time of their Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>January,</HI> as the days began to lengthen, the cold began to &s;trengthen; which proceeded to that ex|tremity, that it rai&s;ed bli&s;ters on their Fle&s;h as if they had been burnt with Fire, and if at any time they touched Iron, it would &s;tick to their Fingers like Bird|lime: If they went out of Doors to fetch in a little Water it would &s;o pinch them, that they were &s;ore as if they had been beaten. In the beginning of Winter, with Pick-axes breaking the Ice daily, they got &s;ome Water on the Sea-&s;hore: but after <HI>January</HI> 10. they had none but Snow-water which they melted with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot Irons, which was their only Drink <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill <HI>May</HI> 20. following.</P>
<P>By the la&s;t of <HI>Jan.</HI> the Days were 7 or 8 Hours long, and then viewing their Victuals again, they found that it would not la&s;t above &s;ix Weeks longer, which
<PB N="66" REF="72">made them fear further Famine; but <HI>they had recour&s;e to God,</HI> who they knew, could &s;upply them beyond their hopes.</P>
<P>Looking out on a bright day, they &s;aw a great &s;he Bear with her Cub coming toward their Tent, whereupon Arming them&s;elves with their Lances, the went forth, and &s;taid her coming; &s;he &s;oon ca&s;t her greedy Eye upon them, and hoping to devour them, ha&s;ted towards them: But with their Lances they gave her &s;uch an hearty welcome, that &s;he tumbled upon the Ground, biting the Snow for anger: The Cub &s;eeing this, e&s;cap'd by flight: The Weather was &s;o extream Cold, that they were fain pre|&s;ently to retire into the Tent, and hav|ing warmed them&s;elves, they drew in the dead Bear, wherewith they Dined merrily; and this Bear &s;erv'd them 20 days: Only this mi&s;chance they had, Eating her Liver, it made their Skins peel off; when &s;he was &s;pent, they yet fear'd that their Veni&s;on would not hold out till the Fleet came out of <HI>England;</HI> but God &s;ent many Bears to their Tent, by times, at lea&s;t 40, whereof they kill'd 7; One of which was exceeding great, at lea&s;t 6 Foot High; &s;o that their Food in|crea&s;ing, they kept not them&s;elves to &s;uch &s;hort Commons, but oft Eat two or three
<PB N="67" REF="73">Meals a Day, which much increa&s;ed their &s;trength.</P>
<P>By this, the chearful Days lengthen'd &s;o fa&s;t, that &s;everal &s;ort of Fowl re&s;orted thither. <HI>March</HI> 16. one of their Ma&s;tiffs went abroad which they never &s;aw after; upon the coming of the Fowls, the Foxes, which all Winter had kept their Bur|roughts under the Rocks, came abroad to &s;eek for their livings; whereupon they &s;et up Traps, which they baited with the Skins of the&s;e Fowls, by which means they caught at times 50 Foxes; all which they roa&s;ted, and found to be good Meat: Then taking the Bear-skins, laying the Fle&s;hy &s;ide upwards, and making Springs of Whale-bone, the caught about &s;ixty Fowls as big as Pigeons.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 1. The Weather began to be pret|ty warm, &s;o that they went daily abroad to &s;eek for Provi&s;ion: but nothing they could find for many Days, till at length they met with abundance of <HI>Willocks</HI> Eggs; of which the carried home thirty, intending the next day to fetch a 1000 more, but the Day proved &s;o Cold that they could not &s;tir out of their Tent. The &s;ame Day there came two Ships of <HI>Hull</HI> into the Sound, who knowing that &s;ome Men had been le&s;t there the Year before, being very de&s;irous to know whe|ther
<PB N="68" REF="74">they were Deat or Alive, the Ma&s;ter Mann'd forth a Shallop to go as near the &s;hore as they could, and &s;o over the Ice to the Tent: When the&s;e Men came near the Tent, they haled them with the u&s;ual word of the Sea, crying <HI>Hey:</HI> to which one of them in the Tent an&s;wered again <HI>Hoe;</HI> which &s;udden an&s;wer almo&s;t amaz'd them all: but perceiving them to be the very Men left there, with joyful Hearts they embrac'd one another, and &s;o com|ing into the Tent, they &s;hew'd the <HI>Hul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Men</HI> the Courte&s;ie of the Hou&s;e, giving them &s;ome Veni&s;on that was Roa&s;ted 4 Months before, and a cup of cold Water, which for novelty &s;ake they kindly ac|cepted of them.</P>
<P>After a little Di&s;cour&s;e, the&s;e 8 Men re&s;olved to leave their Tent, and to go with them to their Ship, where they were welcom'd after the heartie&s;t and kinde&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> manner: and &s;o they &s;taid with them till the <HI>London</HI> Fleet came, which was three days after: At which time they went aboard the Admiral, in which Capt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Will.

So that after 14 days refre&s;hment, they grew
<PB N="69" REF="75">all perfectly well: But when &s;ome of them went to their own Ma&s;ter that had left them there, he fell foul upon them, calling them <HI>Run-aways,</HI> with other har&s;h terms, far enough from the Civility of an hone&s;t Man.

The <HI>Boat&s;wain</HI> re|ceiv'd a mortal Wound in his Groin, and fell down in the Boat; the other two ad|ventur'd in the River, endeavouring by Swimming to e&s;cape the mercile&s;s Hands of cruel Infidels; but the <HI>Negroes</HI> with their &s;wift Canoes &s;oon over-took them, and brought them on &s;hore to the place where the Relater was.

<PB N="73" REF="79">and his Thighs and his Arms, and Shoulders, and broil'd them on the Coals, and with a great deal of impatience, ea|gerly eat it before our Faces, to our great a&s;toni&s;hment.

About 10 days after, the third fell Sick, whom they &s;erved in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>This was no &s;mall cau&s;e of Sorrow to the Relater; the thoughts of their Inhu|man and Barbarous actions, &s;ometimes &s;urrounded him with Fears and Sorrows, hourly expecting to ta&s;te of the &s;aid Cru|elty. Death did not &s;eem &s;o terrible to him, as the violent manner of it; being left now alone in a &s;trange Country, de|&s;titute of Friends or Acquaintance, or any thing that might keep up his Spirits: Die he would fain, but not by the Hands of Infidels and barbarous Mon&s;ters. But the great God, that is mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate in the greate&s;t extremities, had pity on him, and notwitha&s;tnding the alteration of the Climate, and the want of Clothes, and the &s;trangene&s;s of his Food, which

The Natives who were daily expecting another Ban|quet, met with a di&s;appointment: either their Cuo&s;tms, or the over-ruling Power of God, would not &s;uffer them to de&s;troy him, he continuing &s;till in Health. There|fore they re&s;olve to &s;ell him: his <HI>Arannia,</HI> or Ma&s;ter, was pretty free to Di&s;cour&s;e him, which the Relator was capable of, being about 3 Years before in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> where he had learn'd the <HI>Tata</HI> Lan|guage, which is ea&s;ily attain'd, being com|prehended in a very few words, and all the <HI>Negroes</HI> &s;peak it.

The fear of his Ma|&s;ter's Di&s;plea&s;ure and their Inhumanity,
<PB N="75" REF="81">cau&s;ed him to &s;hoot it off; but the <HI>Negroes,</HI> which expected &s;ome delightful thing, were fru&s;trated, and at the &s;udden noi&s;e and fla&s;h of Fire (which they very much dread) ran from him, and were greatly affrighted; but quickly after, hearing no more of that noi&s;e, they came up to him again, and commanded him to <HI>do the like:</HI> He told them <HI>he had not Powder, which was the cau&s;e of the noi&s;e;</HI> but this would not &s;atisfie the&s;e <HI>Barbarians.</HI> He not being able to an&s;wer their expectati|on, they concluded he was not willing, they proceed to threaten him, and were about to Murder him, had not his Ma&s;ter re&s;cu'd him.

Now were his Joys compleated, he thought him&s;elf, as it were, <HI>caught up into the third Heavens;</HI> he could hardly per&s;wade him|&s;elf but it was a Dream or Vi&s;ion, and that he did not really &s;ee <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Faces, or embrace <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bodies.

<P N="2">2. Learn we hence what a Great E|vil it is to lo&s;e the remembrance of our Dangers and Deliverances. What do many Families?

<P N="1">1. Your Dangers are Wonderful in this Re&s;pect, they are often &s;uch as threa|ten a &s;entence of Death to be executed upon you. May it not be &s;aid of poor Sea-men, as was of them; <HI>For we would not (Brethren) have you ignorant of our trou|ble, which came to us in A&s;ia, that we were pre&s;&s;ed out of mea&s;ure, above &s;trength, in&s;o|much that we de&s;paired of Life; but we had the &s;entence of death in our &s;elves, that we &s;hould not tru&s;t in our &s;elves, but in him that rai&s;eth the dead, who delivered us from &s;o great a Death, and doth Deliver,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.8, 9, 10.

<P N="2">2. Your Dangers are Wonderful in this Re&s;pect, they are &s;udden and &s;ur|prizing, they are wonderfully &s;udden; threatned with nothing but pre&s;ent Death and De&s;truction? It may be &s;aid of Sea-men, as of tho&s;e in <HI>Job, Snares compa&s;&s;ed them about, and &s;udden fear trou|bled them,</HI> Job 22.10.

<P N="3"><PB N="127" REF="135">3. Your Dangers are Wonderful in this Re&s;pect, they are not Dangers in which your Bodies are concerned only, but they are Dangers in which your Souls are concerned; It is not only the danger of a Shipwrack'd Ve&s;&s;el, and a Ship-wrack'd E&s;tate, and a Shipwrack'd Body, but a Shipwrack'd Soul. Here is the great danger, le&s;t thou make a lo&s;t Voyage for thy Soul: If thou had&s;t di|ed in &s;uch a Storm, or died in the Time of &s;uch a Voyage; Oh! What would have become of thy Soul, thy precious, thy immortal Soul? Had&s;t not thou died in a Carnal, in a Chri&s;tle&s;s &s;tate and con|dition? Had not they poor Soul peri&s;h'd to all Eternity, if thou then had&s;t mi&s;|carried? Wa&s;t not thou then a &s;tran|ger altogether to Chri&s;t, and a Work of Saving Grace upon thy Heart? Had&s;t not thou then the guilt of all thy &s;ins upon the back of thy Soul unpardoned? And O what danger was this! And wilt thou forget &s;uch dangers?</P>
<P N="4">4. Your Dangers are &s;uch at Sea, as none but a God can deliver from; all your skill cannot; O, then is the great|e&s;t Arti&s;t at his Wits end! The P&s;al|mi&s;t tells us, (<HI>P&s;al.</HI> 107.27.) <HI>the Mari|ners in their Storms, are at their wits end;</HI> (or as &s;ome read it) <HI>all their wi&s;dom is

Then they are <HI>Magor-Mi&s;&s;a|bibs,</HI> terror to them&s;elves, and to all a|bout them; O then, the danger is &s;uch, it mu&s;t be only the finger of God that can help! I have heard of a Ship in <HI>Yar|mouth</HI> Road, that in a great Storm, they feared the Anchor would come home, and the Ma&s;ter di&s;cour&s;ing with a Youth in the Ship, that God had begun lately to work &s;ome Convictions upon, <HI>O &s;ays he,</HI> Ma&s;ter, <HI>if God do but lay a Finger upon one Strand of the Cable, it will hold;</HI> and in the morning many Ships were lo&s;t near them, and there was but one Strand in the Ca|ble left. O the &s;inger of God only can &s;ave in &s;ome dangers. It was a good &s;ay|ing of a Godly Commander of a Ship in imminent danger, <HI>None now but that God that &s;aved the Children of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>at the Red Sea, can &s;ave us out of this di&s;tre&s;s;</HI> and as &s;oon
<PB N="129" REF="137">as he had &s;aid it, the Wind altered, and &s;aved them; And will you forget &s;uch dangers as none but a God can &s;ave from?</P>
<P N="5">5. Your dangers at Sea are &s;uch as many thou&s;ands have peri&s;hed in; how many have gone to Sea, that never returned more? that have been &s;wallowed up in the belly of the great Deeps? How many have peri&s;hed by the Sword at Sea? how many by violent Storms? and that God &s;hould put a difference betwixt you and others, and you &s;hould forget it, this ex|ceedingly heightens and aggravates the guilt. How many have lo&s;t their lives? how many have lo&s;t their limbs? and yet in &s;uch dangers God hath brought you off; this is never to be forgotten.</P>
<P N="2">2. Your dangers are not only wonder|ful, but your deliverances are &s;o too, and therefore &s;hould be remembred. There is never a deliverance, but you may read a wonder in it; &s;o many deliverances and &s;alvations at Sea, &s;o many wonders. God &s;aves you in a miraclous way.</P>
<P N="1">1. Is not this a wonder, that per&s;ons of &s;uch great &s;ins and provocations, &s;hould be per&s;ons of &s;uch great &s;alvations and pre&s;ervations? that &s;uch as &s;in every Voyage, nay, it may be at an high rate &s;in every Voyage, &s;hould be &s;aved and de|livered at &s;uch an high rate every Voyage?
<PB N="130" REF="138">is not this a wonder, that Men of &s;uch &s;ins, &s;hould be men of &s;uch &s;alvations? that men that &s;in again&s;t the&s;e &s;alvations, &s;hould not have the&s;e deliverances &s;horten upon them. Oh what a wonder is this! We &s;hould wonder if a per&s;on &s;hould be con|tinually di&s;obliging any of us, and yet we &s;hould be &s;till heaping up kindne&s;&s;es up|on him: This made the Prophet <HI>Ezra</HI> &s;ay, <HI>Shall we again break his Commandments, after &s;uch deliverances as this?</HI> O do not you pro|voke the Lord every time that you go out and &s;till he delivers you, &s;till he returns you to your Relations, to vi&s;it your habi|tations in peace! and is not this a wonder?</P>
<P N="2">2 Your deliverances are wonderful, if you con&s;ider your deliverances are great deliverances. We read of &s;uch; <HI>And the Lord &s;aved them with a great de|liverance;</HI> or with a great Salvation. Thus &s;aid <HI>Samp&s;on, Thou ha&s;t given this great deliverance into the hand of thy Servant,</HI> (Judg 15.11.) Now any great tran&s;acti|ons are remembred and recorded. Your deliverances are great, if we con&s;ider the&s;e things;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They are commanded deliverances by the great God; his word of command brings all our deliverances about, whether at Sea or Land. Which made the Church in di&s;tre&s;s pray, <HI>Thou art my King, O God, command deliverances
<PB N="131" REF="139">for</HI> Jacob, (<HI>P&s;al.</HI> 44.4.) He commands every thing tending to deliverance at Sea; in order to deliverance, he com|mands the Winds; <HI>He maketh the Storm a Calm,</HI> (P&s;al. 107, 29.) He al&s;o commands the Seas; <HI>He &s;ays to the proud Waves, So far, and no farthar.</HI> You read of a decree &s;et to the Sea, to command the Sea, that it cannot pa&s;s; <HI>Though the Waves thereof to&s;s them&s;elves, yet can they not pre|vail; though they roar, yet can they not pa&s;s over it,</HI> (Jer. 5.22.) It is the great God only that rides Lord Admiral at Sea, to command the Seas and the Waves thereof. God is &s;aid to &s;hut up the Sea with doors, and &s;et bars upon it, <HI>Hitherto &s;halt thou come, and no further; and here &s;hall thy proud waves be &s;tay'd,</HI> (Job. 38.8, 11.) <HI>Xerxes</HI> pre&s;um'd he could tame the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> for attemp|ting his Bridge of Boats; but all this was in vain, this is a flower in God's Crown alone, to command the Sea. Your deli|verances are a fruit and effect of God's commanding Power, therefore great.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They are great deliverances, as they are the curious workman&s;hip (as I may call them) of the Attributes of a great God. Deliverance is &s;aid to be wrought for us, it is the handy work of God; <HI>If God will work, who can let?</HI> (as the Prophet &s;aith, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 43.13, 14.) And he &s;eems to &s;peak
<PB N="132" REF="140">it upon the account of the deliverance of his People: <HI>For your &s;ake I have &s;ent done to Babylon, and have brought down all their Nobles, and the Chaldeans, who&s;e cry is in their &s;hips.</HI> In every deliverance there is the excellent work of the Attributes of God; we may in &s;uch a deliverance &s;ay, <HI>Here is the Power of God,</HI> and <HI>here is the Wi&s;dom of God,</HI> and <HI>here is the Wi&s;dom of God,</HI> and <HI>here is the Love of God,</HI> and <HI>here is the Faithfulne&s;s of God,</HI> &amp;c. For as God in the confounding of the Languages at <HI>Babel,</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Go to, let us go down,</HI> (as if he directed him&s;elf to his glorious Throne) <HI>Come, let us go down.</HI> Gen. 11.7. (Or as &s;ome take it of the Trinity, as in the Creation.) So when God &s;ends us deli|verances in our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, he &s;ets his Attributes at work; <HI>Go Power, go Mercy, go Love, go Faithfulne&s;s, go and act your re&s;pective parts in this deliverance;</HI> and mu&s;t not this be then an excellent and curious Piece that God's Attributes brings forth?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They are great deliver|ances, if we con&s;ider the great &s;ins and provocations they come over the heads of, the great unworthine&s;s of the received, heightens much the mercy and favour received; the rea&s;on why per|&s;ons do not greaten their deliverances, is becau&s;e they do not greaten their &s;ins, in
<PB N="133" REF="141">the deep &s;en&s;e and aggravations of them. O &s;uch a Soul would &s;ay, as <HI>David, is this the manner of Men?</HI> O God, is not this a great deliverance for &s;uch a great &s;inner to receive?</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They are great Deliverances, if we con&s;ider the time and &s;ea&s;on of their coming in; as this Deliverance of the Ships Company where <HI>Paul</HI> was, <HI>it was when all hope of being &s;aved was taken away;</HI> and &s;o were many of the Deliverances, mention'd in this Treati&s;e. So <HI>Peter</HI>'s Sea-Deliverance, <HI>when he began to &s;ink, Chri&s;t &s;tretched forth his hand immediately;</HI> he was now &s;inking and going, but &s;ee how ready Chri&s;t was to &s;ave; <HI>He &s;tretched forth his hand and caught</HI> Peter, (<HI>Matth</HI> 14.28, 29, 30.) Our &s;inking time, is <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t's</HI> &s;av|ing time. <HI>In the Mount is the Lord &s;een;</HI> our extremity is Gods opportunity; and are not then the great deliverances never to be forgotten?</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. They are great deliverances, if we con&s;ider they are not only Deliver|ances of the Bodies, and Ships, and E&s;tates &s;ometimes, but Souls; and where the Ship is lo&s;t, and the E&s;tate is lo&s;t, yet for the life to be &s;aved, and the Soul deliver|ed, is a very great Deliverance; a Re|prieve when a Pri&s;oner is under the &s;en|tence of Death, is a great Mercy: O when God Reprieves a poor Pri&s;oner, this is &s;ome Deliverance; we read of
<PB N="134" REF="142">&s;ome Deliverance God gave to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the days of <HI>Shi&s;hak;</HI> a Reprieve is &s;ome Deliverance, but if it end in &s;uing out the Pri&s;oner's Pardon, then it is a great Deliverance. If it be &s;uch a Deliverance in a Storm at Sea, as <HI>Hezekiah</HI> had from a Sickne&s;s at Shore, <HI>Thou ha&s;t deliver'd me in love to my Soul, and ca&s;t all my Sins behind thy back,</HI> (I&s;a. 38.) This is a double De|liverance, and &s;ure &s;uch Deliverances as the&s;e are worth Recording; The&s;e are to be written in Marble and not in Du&s;t, with the Pen of Iron, (as the Prophet &s;ays) and not with the point of a Dia|mond.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="3">3. Your Deliverances are wonderful, if you con&s;ider the many thou&s;ands that have peri&s;hed in le&s;s Dangers to an Eye of Rea&s;on; they are di&s;tingui&s;hing Deli|verances, and therefore wonderful; hath God dealt with all Men that go to Sea as with you. Have not thou&s;and peri&s;hed by the Sword at Sea in bloody Engage|ments? Mi&s;carried at Sea in dreadful and terrible Storms; Hath not the Sea been a Sepulchre for thou&s;ands? Are not there Millions of the Dead that the Sea mu&s;t one Day give up, and yet you Delivered, and yet you Spared? O what di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Mercy is this! And &s;hall this be for|gotten by you? Should not you keep Re|cords

<P N="4">4. Your Deliverances are Wonderful, if you con&s;ider the way that &s;ometimes God takes to bring them about; O what &s;trange ways doth God take to Deliver, when he hath a Mind to Deliver; &s;ome|times he brings down to the <HI>very Gate of the Grave,</HI> he brings to the Doors and Bars of the Sea, and then &s;huts the&s;e Doors; as <HI>Job</HI> &s;peaks, He brings to the next Door to peri&s;hing, and then he De|livers; <HI>Ma&s;ter &s;ave me, or I peri&s;h;</HI> and then he lends an Arm, witne&s;s many of the&s;e Deliverances here mention'd. Some|times he doth it by &s;trange means; low and contemptible, as the poor Man that we Read of, that Delivered the City, (<HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 2.15.) &s;ometimes by unthought of and unexpected means, as he that Re|lieved Major <HI>Gibbons,</HI> as this Story men|tions, he was a <HI>French</HI> Pyrate. As that Ship I have heard of, that when &s;he &s;prang a Leak, and they all had like to have peri&s;hed, and all on a &s;udden the Leak &s;topt, and they knew no Rea&s;on, but when they came into the next Port
<PB N="136" REF="144">to &s;earch her, there was a great Fi&s;h ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wrought him&s;elf in the Leak, that they were glad to cut him out; was not here a Miraculous Deliverance?

Methinks this one Motive &s;hould &s;et on the Exhortation, if I &s;hould u&s;e no more, to Remember your Dangers and your Deliverances.</P>
<P>But &s;econdly, another Motive is this, to Remember your Dangers with your Deliverances; this will in your great Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Extremities, contribute &s;ome Hope to you; to read over your Regi&s;ter, your ancient Records, how good God hath been at &s;uch a time, and &s;uch a time; how &s;ea&s;onably he &s;tept in and Delivered in &s;uch a &s;trait and &s;uch a &s;trait; Oh then &s;ays the Soul, why then &s;hould I De&s;pair, and ca&s;t off all Hope now? Hath not he appeared and &s;aved in Deaths often before now? For pa&s;t Experiences are good &s;upports for Hope in pre&s;ent Exigencies and Extre|mities; thus <HI>David</HI> argues, when at a great &s;trait, <HI>Thou ha&s;t delivered me, and

I will render prai&s;es unto thee,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 56.11. (and in ano|ther place) <HI>I will pay thee my Vows, which my Lips have uttered, and my Mouth hath &s;poken when I was in trouble,</HI> (P&s;al. 66.13, 14.) But becau&s;e this is &s;o ordinary to make Vows at Sea, and break them a Shoar, let me enlarge a little upon it. 1. Why &s;hould you forget your Vows after your Deliverances? They were not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;h Vows, there might have been &s;ome Excu&s;e if you had made them ra&s;h|ly, you might then have had a Plea, for &s;aying it was an Error; but in times of Di&s;tre&s;s Men are &s;erious, when Death and Eternity are &s;et before them, and they upon the brink of another World; dare you Sinners ra&s;hly Vow, in this day of your Di&s;tre&s;s; O no, your Con&s;ciences will bear Witne&s;s again&s;t you, that you were in Sober-&s;adne&s;s at that day. 2. Why &s;hould you ferget your Vows after Deliverances, for God will require Pay|ment?
<PB N="139" REF="147">Nay, this is not only the Rea&s;on why we &s;hould not forget to pay, but why we &s;hould not delay the Pay; <HI>When thou vowe&s;t a Vow to the Lord thy God, thou &s;hould&s;t not be &s;lack to Pay it, for the Lord thy God will require it, yea, will &s;urely require it of thee, and it would be Sin in thee,</HI> (Deut. 23.21.) Take it for granted he will do it, &s;o as to call to a Payment Day, he will demand it, he will &s;end unto you a Summons to Pay the Vows you made to him in the day of your Di&s;tre&s;s. Oh! How often is Con|&s;cience, God's Officer, that he &s;ends to you to demand Payment? O &s;ays Con|&s;cience, <HI>Sinner, Pay what thou owe&s;t to the God of thy Deliverances; it not he a God to whom thy Vows mu&s;t be Performed?</HI> 2. He will require it, &s;o as to puni&s;h the Non|payment; and &s;o requiring is here ta|ken, and in many other places, the Lord, doth very often &s;everely puni&s;h Vow|breaking; breaking of Vows doth cau&s;e God often to de&s;troy the works of your Hands. Say not before the Angel, <HI>It was an Error, wherefore &s;hould God be angry at thy Vows, and de&s;troy the works of thy Hands?</HI> (Eccle&s;. 5.4, 5.) Some Expo&s;itors refes this to the Prie&s;t, before whom the Sin of ra&s;h Vows was to be confe&s;s'd; others carry it to Chri&s;t, the Angel of the Co|venant,
<PB N="140" REF="148">who &s;ees through all our &s;ubti Excu&s;es and Equivocations, and puni&s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them.

<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> to forget your Deliverances and Dangers, is the greate&s;t Ingratitude and Unthankfulne&s;s in the World; hath God given you &s;o many wonderful De|liverances, &s;o many miraculous Pre&s;er|vations, to be buried in the Grave of Oblivion? Will you Murder your Mer|cies and then bury them? It is common|ly &s;aid, <HI>Murder will out.</HI> Murdered Mer|cies will one day make terrible work, in walking in your Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>The next Ob&s;ervation is this, That Salvations and Deliverances many times are not &s;ent until Per&s;ons be left Help|le&s;s and Hopele&s;s. I &s;hall give you a touch of this. <HI>Now all hope of being &s;aved was taken away, no &s;mall Tempe&s;t lay upon upon them; now they were gulft in De&s;pair of ever coming off with their Lives:</HI> Yet this often is the condition of Nations, Ship-Companies, and Per&s;ons, where God intends to &s;ave and deliver. The Proofs of the la&s;t Ob&s;ervations about Dangers and Deliverances being record|ed
<PB N="141" REF="149">and remembred, proves this al&s;o. Thus was <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aved, the Di&s;ciples &s;aved, when ju&s;t at &s;inking.</P>
<P>But why doth God &s;tay &s;o long before he &s;ends Deliverances and Salvations? 1. Becau&s;e he delights to draw forth a Spirit of Prayer; if Men will not Pray when &s;inking, when Drowning, when Dying, they will never Pray. O &s;ee how <HI>Jonah</HI> Prays in his di&s;tre&s;s: <HI>And</HI> Jonah <HI>Prayed to the Lord out of the Fi&s;hes Belly, and &s;aid, I cried by rea&s;on of mine Affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me; out of the Belly of Hell cried I, and thou hearde&s;t my Voice,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>When my Soul faint|ed within me, I remembred the Lord; and my Prayer came in unto thy Holy Temple,</HI> (Jonah 2.1, 2, 3, 7.) O Sirs, God loves Prayer &s;o well, that he &s;tays with his Deliverances, that he might &s;ue them out by Prayer. <HI>Out of the Depths have 1 cried unto thee,</HI> &s;aith <HI>David,</HI> (P&s;al. 130. 1.) Driven to it by deep and bottomle&s;s &s;traits, into which I am plunged. And it &s;eems to be an Illu&s;ion to Mariners, in their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Dangers of being Shipwrackt, crying unto the Lord. What, will any Man peri&s;h, and never Pray for it? Die, and never Cry for it? What, and not &s;ay as <HI>Peter</HI> did, <HI>Ma&s;ter, &s;ave me, or I peri&s;h?</HI> What was it that did draw
<PB N="142" REF="150">forth Prayer in many of the&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Ship Companies (in this Treati&s;e menti|oned) but their Dangers and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es?</P>
<P N="2">2. God doth not bring our Deliver|ances and Salvations until we be Hope|le&s;s, becau&s;e he will exerci&s;e his Peoples Graces: Therefore the Di&s;ciples were not &s;aved until the Ship was full, that their Graces might be exerci&s;ed. O now is a time for Faith and Patience to be exerted, there is nothing more plea&s;ing unto God, than to &s;ee how poor Souls exerci&s;e their Graces, when they are re|duced to Extremities; God hath a great revenue of Glory ari&s;ing to him&s;elf, out of the exerci&s;e of his own Grace in the Souls of Believers. O how doth Faith act its part when Mercy and Deliverance is delay'd! It was one of <HI>Luther</HI>'s won|ders, <HI>to believe for Mercy that was long de|lay'd.</HI> It is an high exerci&s;e of Faith, to look up to God long together, and no|thing to come. To &s;ay with the Pro|phet <HI>Jonah, I will look again towards thy Holy Temple,</HI> (Jonah 2.4, 8.) And with the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah, Tho' he hide his Face from the Hou&s;e of</HI> Jacob, <HI>I will wait upon him, and look for him,</HI> (I&s;aiah 17.) What tho' thou be as the Prophet's Servant, who went down to the Sea to look, and he &s;aid <HI>Ma&s;ter, there is nothing.</HI> But what
<PB N="143" REF="151">then? Doth he give over? O no, <HI>the looks again;</HI> and <HI>the &s;eventh look he &s;aw he Cloud.</HI> So Faith in its exerci&s;e, will look again and again, and never give over, until it e&s;pie the Mercy coming upon the wings of Prayer. So might I add of Patience; O how doth it act its part while the Deliverance tarries; it quietly waits for the Salvation of God; &s;aying, as <HI>David, My Soul waits for the Lord, more than they that watch for the Morning,</HI> (P&s;al. 130.6.) The Soul of the Believer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it &s;elf in Patience until the Mercy come.</P>
<P N="3">3. God doth not bring our Salvations and Deliverances, until we be brought to an Extremity; becau&s;e they are mo&s;t prized and welcomed then. O now Deliverance will be prized: The longer that a Mercy tarries, the more welcome it is when it comes: God loves to make all his Mercies welcome to us. O how welcome is Life, to a Per&s;on under a Sentence of Death! O how welcome is a Di&s;covery of the love of Chri&s;t to a poor Soul, that hath long groaned under the burthen of unpardon'd Guilt! O how welcome was the Prodigal's Father's Hou&s;e, when he had &s;o long been &s;tar|ving in the Fields, with his Husks, a|mong&s;t the Swine!</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="144" REF="152">4. Becau&s;e God will have all his Sal|vations and Deliverances look like his own Hand and Arm, his Arm brings Salvation with him; he will have the print of his own Hand upon it, that poor Sinners may &s;ay, <HI>This is the Finger of God, the doing of God, and it is marvellous in our Eyes.</HI> Alas, Men would attribute it to them&s;elves, if Salvation did not come in &s;uch a way, <HI>when all hope of be|ing Saved is taken away.</HI> Oh! Every thing is beautiful in its Sea&s;on; is not Salvation and Deliverance now in Sea|&s;on? Now they begin to De&s;pair, as to probable or vi&s;ible hopes. O now, God works like him&s;elf, now he appears in a Deliverance to be God; which &s;et the Di&s;ciples a wondering, <HI>What manner of Man is this, that the Winds and the Sea obey him?</HI> Mark 4.41. And at another time, when he deliver'd his Di&s;ciples at Sea, and calmed the Winds, then they that were in the Ship Wor&s;hipped him, &s;aying, <HI>Of a truth thou art the Son of God,</HI> 14.32, 33.</P>
<P N="5">5. Becau&s;e he will by &s;uch Salvations &s;et off his Love to poor Souls: Was not the Love of Chri&s;t &s;et off highly, in ta|king that Sea&s;on to &s;ave the Ship <HI>when it was full; to &s;ave them when they were &s;inking;</HI> is not that great Love, that &s;teps
<PB N="145" REF="153">forth to &s;ave in an Extremity? O what Love was this, to &s;ave this Ships Com|pany, <HI>when all hope of being &s;aved was ta|ken away?</HI> Love always chu&s;es the fitte&s;t times to appear and evidence it &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Becau&s;e he will have his Deli|verances, endearing Deliverances to Souls. O how doth &s;uch an appearance of God, at &s;uch a time, endear the Soul of the Receiver. Therefore, &s;aith <HI>Da|vid, I will love the Lord,</HI> (or love the Lord dearly) <HI>my Rock, and my Deliverer,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But I will proceed to give you al&s;o a|ta&s;te of the <HI>Application,</HI> and not to be large, becau&s;e I have been large upon the former, which was mainly intended.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then learn we hence, that God may for gracious ends, known to him&s;elf, delay a Mercy or a Deliverance, and yet fully intend to give in that Mercy. <HI>Ja|cob may wre&s;tle all Night, and yet be put off; but in the break of Day the Mercy comes.</HI> The Woman of <HI>Canaan</HI> may cry to Chri&s;t for her Daughter, and at pre&s;ent be put off, yet at la&s;t &s;he &s;hall carry it. The belie|ving Soul may not have the <HI>Dove</HI> come with an <HI>Olive-Branch</HI> in her Mouth until Evening. Chri&s;t's manife&s;ting of his Love to poor Souls, is called his Supping with them; <HI>And I will Sup with you:</HI> Now Supper comes not up till Evening.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="146" REF="154">2. Learn we hence, that God's timing our Deliverances and Salvations, is be&s;t for us; his Time is the be&s;t Time. Our time is always ready, (but &s;aith Chri&s;t) <HI>My time is not yet.</HI> If we had our Mercies in our time, we &s;hould not &s;ee that beau|ty in them; for every thing is beautiful in its Sea&s;on: And God chu&s;es the fitte&s;t Sea&s;ons to &s;end them, becau&s;e he will put a beauty upon them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Learn we hence, <HI>that no ca&s;e is de|&s;perate to God, tho' it be &s;o to Man:</HI> One would have thought this a de&s;perate ca&s;e, <HI>in &s;uch a Storm, lightning the Ship,</HI> the <HI>ca&s;t|ing cut of the Tackling of the Ship, neither Sun nor Stars appeared, and all hope of be|ing &s;aved taken away;</HI> yet all this was but de&s;perate to them, it was not &s;o to God: Now their Extremity becomes God's op|portunity, and he takes this Juncture of time to appear in. Thus <HI>David,</HI> P&s;al. 42. 7, 8. all God's <HI>Waves and</HI> God's <HI>Billows had gone over him;</HI> a de&s;perate ca&s;e! Yet God (then he believes) <HI>would command his loving kindne&s;s in the Day-time, and the Song &s;hould be with him in the Night.</HI> Faith is an excellent Grace at a de&s;perate &s;tand.</P>
<P N="4">4. Learn we hence, that <HI>God's Thoughts are not as our thoughts;</HI> when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> think of nothing but &s;inking and peri&s;hing, then doth God think of Saving and Delivering.
<PB N="147" REF="155">They thought <HI>all hope of being &s;aved was taken away,</HI> but God looks through the Storm and Cloud, and Comforts them. As the Di&s;ciples, when they thought it had been a Spirit in their Storm that ap|peared to them; <HI>No,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>be not afraid; be of good chear, it is I,</HI> Mark 6. 50, 51, 52.</P>
<P><HI>U&s;e</HI> 2. Is it &s;o, that the Salvations and Deliverances that many of us have, are not until we are brought to Extremities? Then it is a word of <HI>Exhortation;</HI> Then look up to God in the mo&s;t de&s;perate Ca&s;e, when you know not what to do in your Storms at Sea, in your Straits at Land. O then let your Eyes be up unto the Lord; you &s;ee how many Delive|rances have come down in Extremities, as an&s;wers to Prayer. O Pray hard; let going to Sea, being in Storms at Sea, being brought to Extremities at Sea, learn you to Pray.</P>

<P>O Come, let us give thanks unto the Lord, for his mercy endureth for ever.</P>
<P>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be prai&s;ed; let the redeemed of the Lord &s;ay &s;o; whom he hath delivered from the mercile&s;s rage of the Sea.</P>
<P>The Lord is gracious and full of com|pa&s;&s;ion: flow to anger, and of great mercy.</P>
<P>He hath not dealt with us according to our &s;ins: neither rewarded us accord|ing to our iniquitirs.</P>
<P>But as the Heaven his above the Earth: &s;o great hath been his mercy towards us.</P>
<P>We found trouble and heavine&s;s: we were even at deaths door;</P>
<P>The Waters of the Sea had well nigh cover'd us: the proud waters had nigh gone over our &s;oul.</P>
<P>The Sea roared and the &s;tormy wind lifted the waves thereof;</P>
<P>We were carried up, as it were to Heaven, and went down again into the deep: our &s;oul melted within us, be|cau&s;e of trouble;</P>
<P>Then cried we unto the Lord: and
<PB REF="167">thou did&s;t deliver us out of our di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be thy name, who did&s;t not de&s;pi&s;e the prayer of thy &s;ervants; but did&s;t hear our cry, and ha&s;t &s;aved us.</P>
<P>Thou did&s;t &s;end forth thy command|ment: and the windy &s;torm cea&s;ed, and was turned into a calm.</P>
<P>O let us therefore prai&s;e the Lord for his goodne&s;s: and declare the wonders that he hath done, and &s;till doeth for the children of men.</P>
<P>Prai&s;ed be the Lord daily; even the Lord that helped us, and poured his benefits upon us.</P>
<P>He is our God, even the God of whom cometh &s;alvation; God is the Lord by whom we e&s;caped death.</P>
<P>Thou Lord ha&s;t made us glad through the operation of thy hands; and we will triumph in thy prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God; even the Lord God who only doeth wondrous things.</P>
<P>And ble&s;&s;ed be the name of his Ma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> for ever; and let every one of us &s;ay, Amen, Amen.</P>
<P>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son; and to the holy Gho&s;t;</P>
<P>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever &s;hall be; world without end. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Prayer to be &s;aid before a Fight at Sea again&s;t any Enemy.</HEAD>
<P>O Mo&s;t powerful and glorious Lord God, the Lord of ho&s;ts, that ru|le&s;t and commande&s;t all things; Thou &s;itte&s;t in the throne judging right: and therefore we make our addre&s;s to thy di|vine Maje&s;ty in this our nece&s;&s;ity, that thou would&s;t take the cau&s;e into thy own hand, and judge between us and our enemies. Stir up thy &s;trength, O Lord, and come and help us; for thou give&s;t not always the battel to the &s;trong, but can&s;t &s;ave by many or by few, O let not our &s;ins now cry again&s;t us for ven|geance, but hear us thy poor &s;ervants beg|ing mercy and imploring thy help, and that thou would&s;t be a defence unto us again&s;t the face of the enemy. Make it appear that thou art our Saviour and mighty deliverer, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
