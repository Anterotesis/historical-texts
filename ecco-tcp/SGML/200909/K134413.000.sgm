<P>AS cen&s;ure is but awkwardly &s;oftened by apology, I &s;hall offer you no apology for this letter. The eventful cri&s;is to which your double politics have con|ducted the affairs of your country requires an inve&s;ti|gation uncramped by ceremony.</P>
<P>There was a time when the fame of America, moral and political, &s;tood fair and high in the world. The lu&s;tre of her revolution extended it&s;elf to every indi|vidual; and to be a citizen of America gave a title to re&s;pect in Europe. Neither meanne&s;s nor ingratitude had then mingled it&s;elf into the compo&s;ition of her character. Her re&s;i&s;tance to the attempted tyranny of England left her un&s;u&s;pected of the one, and her open acknowledgment of the aid &s;he received from
<PB N="4" REF="4">France precluded all &s;u&s;picion of the other. The Wa&s;h|ington of politics had not then appeared.</P>
<P>At the time I left America (April 1787) the conti|nental convention that formed the federal con&s;titution was on the point of meeting. Since that time new &s;chemes of politics and new di&s;tinctions of parties, have ari&s;en. The term <HI>Antifederali&s;t</HI> has been applied to all tho&s;e who combated the defects of that con&s;titution, or oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ures of your admini&s;tration. It was only to the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ome federal authority, extending equally over all the States, that an in&s;trument, &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent as the pre&s;ent fede|ral con&s;titution is, obtained a &s;uffrage. I would have voted for it my&s;elf, had I been in America, or even for a wor&s;e rather than have had none; provided it con|tained the means of remedying its defects by the &s;ame appeal to the people by which it was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. It is always better policy to leave removeable errors to expo&s;e them&s;elves, than to hazard too much in con|tending again&s;t them theoretically.</P>
<P>I have introduced tho&s;e ob&s;ervations, not only to mark the general difference between antifederali&s;t and anti-con&s;titutionali&s;t, but to preclude the effect, and even the application, of the former of tho&s;e terms to my&s;elf. I declare my&s;elf oppo&s;ed to &s;everal matters in the con&s;titution, particularly to the man|ner in which, what is called the Executive, is form|ed, and to the long duration of the Senate; and
<PB N="5" REF="5">if I live to return to America I will u&s;e all my en|deavours to have them altered.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have always been oppo&s;ed to the mode of refining Gov|ernment up to an individual, or what is called a &s;ingle Execu|tive. Such a man will always be the chief of a party. A plu|rality is far better: It combines the ma&s;s of a nation better to|gether: And be&s;ides this, it is nece&s;&s;ary to the manly mind of a republic, that it lo&s;es the deba&s;ing idea of obeying an individual.</NOTE> I al&s;o declare my|&s;elf oppo&s;ed to almo&s;t the whole of your admini&s;tra|tion; for I know it to have been deceitful, if not even perfidious, as I &s;hall &s;hew in the cour&s;e of this letter. But as to the point of con&s;olidating the &s;tates into a federal government, it &s;o happens, that the pro|po&s;ition for that purpo&s;e came originally from my&s;elf. I propo&s;ed it in a letter to Chancellor Living&s;ton in the &s;pring of the year 1782, whil&s;t that gentleman was mi|ni&s;ter for foreign affairs. The five per cent. duty re|commended by Congre&s;s had then fallen through, having been adopted by &s;ome of the States, altered by others, rejected by Rhode I&s;land, and repealed by Virginia after it had been con&s;ented to. The propo|&s;al in the letter I allude to was to get over the whole difficulty at once, by annexing a continental legi&s;lative body to Congre&s;s; for, in order to have any law of the Union uniform, the ca&s;e could only be, that either Congre&s;s, as it then &s;tood, mu&s;t frame the law, and the States &s;everally adopt it without alteration, or, the States mu&s;t elect a Continental Legi&s;lature for the purpo&s;e. Chancellor Living&s;ton, Robert Morris, Go|verneur
<PB N="6" REF="6">Morris and my&s;elf had a meeting at the hou&s;e of Robert Morris on the &s;ubject of that letter. There was no diver&s;ity of opinion on the propo&s;ition for a Continental Legi&s;lature. The only difficulty was on the manner of bringing the propo&s;ition forward. For my own part, as I con&s;idered it as a remedy in re&s;erve, that could be applied at any time, <HI>when the States &s;aw them&s;elves wrong enough to be put right</HI> (which did not appear to me to be the ca&s;e at that time) I did not &s;ee the propriety of urging it precipitately, and declined being the publi&s;her of it my&s;elf. After this account of a fact, the leaders of your party will &s;carcely have the hardine&s;s to apply to me the term of antifederali&s;t. But I can go to a date and to a fact beyond this; for the propo&s;ition for electing a Continental Convention to form the Continental Government is one of the &s;ub|jects treated of in the pamphlet <HI>Common Sen&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus cleared away a little of the rubbi&s;h that might otherwi&s;e have lain in my way, I return to the point of time at which the pre&s;ent Federal Con&s;titu|tion and your admini&s;tration began. It was very well &s;aid by an anonymous writer in Philadelphia, about a year before that period, that <HI>"thirteen &s;taves and ne'er a hoop will not make a barrel,"</HI> and as any kind of hoop|ing the barrel, however defectively executed, would be better than none, it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible but that con&s;iderable advantages mu&s;t ari&s;e from the federal hooping of the States. It was with plea&s;ure that every
<PB N="7" REF="7">&s;incere friend to America beheld, as the natural effect of union, her ri&s;ing pro&s;perity; and it was with grief they &s;aw that pro&s;perity mixed, even in the blo&s;&s;om, with the germ of corruption. Monopolies of every kind marked your admini&s;tration almo&s;t in the moment of its commencement. The lands obtained by the re|volution were lavi&s;hed upon partizans; the intere&s;t of the di&s;banded &s;oldier was &s;old to the &s;peculator; in|ju&s;tice was acted under the pretence of faith; and the chief of the army became the patron of the fraud. From &s;uch a beginning what could be expected, but what has happened? A mean and &s;ervile &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the in&s;ults of one nation, treachery and ingratitude to another.</P>
<P>Some vices make their approach with &s;uch a &s;plen|did appearance, that we &s;carcely know to what cla&s;s of moral di&s;tinctions they belong. They are rather vir|tues corrupted, than vices originally. But meanne&s;s and ingratitude, than vices originally. But meanne&s;s and ingratitude have nothing equivocal in their cha|racter. There is not a trait in them that renders them doubtful. They are &s;o originally vice, that they are generated in the dung of other vices, and crawl into exi&s;tence with the filth upon their back. The fugi|tives have found protection in you, and the levee-room is their place of rendezvous.</P>
<P>As the Federal Con&s;titution is a copy, not quite &s;o ba&s;e as the original, of the form of the Briti&s;h govern|ment, an imitation of its vices was naturally to be ex|pected.
<PB N="8" REF="8">So intimate is the connection between <HI>form</HI> and <HI>practice,</HI> that to adopt the one is to invite the other. Imitation is naturally progre&s;&s;ive, and is rapidly &s;o in matters that are vicious.</P>
<P>Soon after the Federal Con&s;titution arrived in England, I received a letter from a female literary corre&s;pondent (a native of New York) very well mixed with friend&s;hip, &s;entiment and politics. In my an&s;wer to that letter I permitted my&s;elf to ram|ble into the wilderne&s;s of imagination, and to antici|pate what might hereafter be the condition of Ame|rica. I had no idea that the picture then drew was realizing &s;o fa&s;t, and &s;till le&s;s that, Mr. Wa&s;hington was hurrying it on. As the extract I allude to is congenial with the &s;ubject I am upon, I here tran|&s;cribe it.</P>
<P><Q>You touch me on a very tender point when you &s;ay, <HI>that my friends on your &s;ide the water cannot be reconciled to the idea of my abandoning America, even for my native England.</HI> They are right. I had rather &s;ee my hor&s;e Button eating the gra&s;s of Bor|dentown or Morri&s;enia, than &s;ee all the pomp and &s;hew of Europe.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A thou&s;and years hence, for I mu&s;t indulge a few thoughts, perhaps in le&s;s, America may be what England now is. The innocence of her cha|racter, that won the hearts of all nations in her fa|vour, may &s;ound like a romance, and her inimita|ble
<PB N="9" REF="9" MS="y">virtue as if it had never been. The ruins of that liberty, which thou&s;ands bled to obtain, may ju&s;t furni&s;h materials for a village tale, or ex|tort a &s;igh from ru&s;tic &s;en&s;ibility; whil&s;t the fa&s;hion|able of that day, enveloped in di&s;&s;ipation, &s;hall de|ride the principle and deny the fact.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When we contemplate the fall of empires &amp; the extinction of the nations of the ancient world, we &s;ee but little more to excite our regret than the mouldering ruins of pompous palaces, magnificent monuments, lofty pyramids, and walls and towers of the mo&s;t co&s;tly workman&s;hip: But when the empire of America &s;hall fall, the &s;ubject for con|templative &s;orrow will be infinitely greater than crumbling bra&s;s or marble can in&s;pire. It will not then be &s;aid, here &s;tood a temple of va&s;t antiquity, here ro&s;e a babel of invi&s;ible height, or there a pa|lace of &s;umptuous extravagance; but here ah pain|ful thought! the noble&s;t work of human wi&s;|dom, the grande&s;t &s;cene of human glory, the fair cau&s;e of freedom ro&s;e and fell. Read this, and then a&s;k, if I forget America?</Q></P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed, as I was, with apprehen&s;ions of this kind, I had America con&s;tantly in mind in all the publica|tions I afterwards made. The fir&s;t, and &s;till more, the &s;econd part of Rights of Man bear evident marks of this watchfulne&s;s; and the Di&s;&s;ertation on Fir&s;t Principles of Government goes more directly to the
<PB N="10" REF="10">point than either of the former. I now pa&s;s on to other &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>It will be &s;uppo&s;ed by tho&s;e into who&s;e hands this letter may fall, that I have &s;ome per&s;onal re&s;entment again&s;t you; I will therefore &s;ettle this point before I proceed farther.</P>
<P>If I have any re&s;entment, you mu&s;t acknowledge that I have not been ha&s;ty in declaring it; neither would it be now declared (for what are private re|&s;entments to the public) if the cau&s;e of it did not unite it&s;elf as well with your public as your private charac|ter, and with the motives of your political conduct.</P>
<P>The part I acted in the American revolution is well known; I &s;hall not here repeat it. I know al&s;o that had it not been for the aid received from France in men, money and &s;hips, that your cold and unmi|litary conduct (as I &s;hall &s;hew in the cour&s;e of this letter) would, in all probability, have lo&s;t America; at lea&s;t &s;he would not have been the independent na|tion &s;he now is. You &s;lept away your time in the field till the finances of the country were completely exhau&s;ted, and you have but little &s;hare in the glory of the final event. It is time, fir, to &s;peak the un|di&s;gui&s;ed language of hi&s;torical truth.</P>
<P>Elevated to the chair of the Pre&s;idency you a&s;&s;u|med the merit of every thing to your&s;elf, and the na|tural ingratitude of your con&s;titution began to ap|pear. You commenced your Pre&s;idential carreer by
<PB N="11" REF="11">encouraging and &s;wallowing the gro&s;&s;e&s;t adulation, and you travelled America from one end&mdash;to the other, to put your&s;elf in the way of receiving it. You have as many addre&s;&s;es in your che&s;t as James the II. As to what were your views, for if you are not great enough to have ambition you are little enough to have vanity, they cannot be directly inferred from expre&s;&s;ions of your own; but the partizans of your politics have divulged the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>John Adams has &s;aid (and John, it is known, was always a &s;peller after places and offices, and never thought his little &s;ervices were highly enough paid) John has &s;aid, that as Mr. Wa&s;hington had no child, that the Pre&s;idency &s;hould be made hereditary in the family of Lund Wa&s;hington. John might then have counted upon &s;ome &s;ine-cure for him&s;elf and a provi&s;ion for his de&s;cendants. He did not go &s;o far as to &s;ay al&s;o, that the Vice Pre&s;idency &s;hould be he|reditary in the family of John Adams. He prudent|ly left that to &s;tand upon the ground, that one good turn de&s;erves another.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two per&s;ons to whom John Adams &s;aid this, told n e of it The &s;ecretary of Mr. Jay was pre&s;ent when it was told to me.</NOTE></P>
<P>John Adams is one of tho&s;e men who never con|templated the origin of government, or compre|hended any thing of fir&s;t principles. If he had, he mu&s;t have &s;een that the right to &s;et up and e&s;tabli&s;h hereditary government never did, and never can,
<PB N="12" REF="12">exi&s;t in any generation, at any time whatever; that it is of the nature of trea&s;on; becau&s;e it is an at|tempt to take away the rights of all the minors living at that time, and of all &s;ucceeding generations. It is of a degree beyond common trea&s;on. It is a &s;in again&s;t nature. The equal right of generations is a right fixed in the nature of things. It belongs to the &s;on when of age, as it belonged to the father before him. John Adams would him&s;elf deny the right that any former decea&s;ed generation could have to decree authoritatively a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Governors over him, or over his children; and yet he a&s;&s;umes the pretended right, trea&s;onable as it is, of acting it him&s;elf. His ignorance is his be&s;t excu&s;e.</P>
<P>John Jay has &s;aid (and this John was always the &s;ycophant of every thing in power, from Mr. Girard in America to Grenville in England) John Jay has &s;aid, that the Senate &s;hould have been appointed for life. He would then have been &s;ure of never wanting a lucrative appointment for him&s;elf, nor have had any &s;ears about impeachments. The&s;e, are the di&s;gui&s;ed traitors that call them&s;elves federali&s;ts.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> know on what author <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> this, I will give that authority publicly when he chu&s;es to call for it.</NOTE></P>
<P>Could I have known to what degree of corruption &amp; perfidy the admini&s;trative part of the government in America had de&s;cended, I could have been at no lo&s;s to have under&s;tood the re&s;ervedne&s;s of Mr.
<PB N="13" REF="13" MS="y">Wa&s;hington towards me, during my impri&s;onment in the Luxembourg. There are ca&s;es in which &s;i|lence is loud language.</P>
<P>I will here explain the cau&s;e of my impri&s;onment, and return to Mr. Wa&s;hington afterwards.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of that rage, terror and &s;u&s;picion, which the brutal letter of the Duke of Brun&s;wick fir&s;t &s;tarted into exi&s;tence in France, it happened, that almo&s;t every man who was oppo&s;ed to violence, or who was not violent him&s;elf, became &s;u&s;pected. I had con&s;tantly been oppo&s;ed to every thing which was of the nature, or of the appearance, of violence; but as I had always done it in a manner that &s;hew|ed it to be a principle founded in my heart, and not a political manoeuvre, it precluded the pretence of accu&s;ing me. I was reached, however, under ano|ther pretence.</P>
<P>A decree was pa&s;&s;ed to impri&s;on all per&s;ons born in England; but as I was a member of the Conven|tion, and had been complimented with the honorary &s;tile of Citizen of France, as Mr. Wa&s;hington and &s;ome other Americans had been, this decree fell &s;hort of reaching me. A motion was afterwards made and carried, &s;upported chiefly by Bourdon de l'Oi&s;e, for expelling foreigners from the Conven|tion. My expulsion being thus effected, the two committees of Public Safety and of General Sure|ty,
<PB N="14" REF="14">of which Robe&s;pierre was the dictator, put me in arre&s;tation under the former decree for impri&s;on|ing per&s;ons born in England. Having thus &s;hewn under what pretence the impri&s;onment was effected, I come to &s;peak of &s;uch parts of the ca&s;e as apply between me and Mr. Wa&s;hington, either as Pre&s;i|dent or as an individual.</P>
<P>I have always con&s;idered that a foreigner, &s;uch as I was in fact with re&s;pect to France, might be a member of a Convention for forming a con&s;titu|tion, without affecting his right of citizen&s;hip in the country to which he belongs, but not a member of a government after a con&s;titution is formed; and I have uniformly acted upon this di&s;tinction. To be a member of a government requires that a per&s;on be in allegiance to that government and to the country locally. But a con&s;titution being a thing of princi|ple and not of action, and which, after it be formed, is to be referred to the people for their approbation or rejection, does not require allegiance in the per|&s;ons forming and propo&s;ing it; and be&s;ides this, it is only to the thing after it be formed and e&s;tabli&s;hed, and to the country after its governmental character is fixed by the adoption of a con&s;titution, that alle|giance can be given. No oath of allegiance or of citizen&s;hip was required of the members who com|po&s;ed the Convention; there was nothing exi&s;ting in form to &s;wear allegiance to. If any &s;uch condition
<PB N="15" REF="15">had been required I could not,as Citizen of America in fact, though Citizen of France by compliment, have accepted a &s;eat in the Convention.</P>
<P>As my citizen&s;hip in America was not altered or dimini&s;hed, by any thing I had done in Europe (on the contrary it ought to have been con&s;idered as &s;trengthened, for it was the American principle of government that I was endeavouring to &s;pread in Europe) and as it is the duty of every government to charge it&s;elf with the care of any of its citizens who may happen to fall under an arbitrary per&s;ecution a|broad, and is al&s;o one of the rea&s;ons for which Am|ba&s;&s;adors or Mini&s;ters are appointed,&mdash;it was the duty of the executive department in America to have made (at lea&s;t) &s;ome enquiries about me, as &s;oon as it heard of my impri&s;onment. But if this had not been the ca&s;e, that government owed it to me on e|very ground and principle of honor and gratitude. Mr. Wa&s;hington owed it to me on every &s;core of private acquaintance, I will not now &s;ay, firend|&s;hip; for it has for &s;ome time been known, by tho&s;e who know him, that he has no friend&s;hips; that he is incapable of forming any; he can &s;erve or de&s;ert a man or a cau&s;e with con&s;titutional indifference; and it is this cold hermophrodite faculty that impo&s;ed it|&s;elf upon the world, and was credited for a while by enemies as by friends, for prudence, moderation and impartiality.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="16">Soon after that I was put in arre&s;tation and im|pri&s;oned in the Luxembourg, the Americans who were then in Paris went in a body to the bar of the Convention to reclaim me. They were an&s;wered by the, then, Pre&s;ident, Vadier, who has &s;ince ab&s;cond|ed, that <HI>I was born in England;</HI> and it was &s;ignified to them by &s;ome of the Committee of surety Gene|ral, to whom they were referred (I have been told it was Billaud Varrennes) that their reclamation of me was only that act of individuals without any autho|rity from the American government.</P>
<P>A few days after this, ail communication from per&s;ons impri&s;oned to any per&s;on without the pri&s;on was cut off by an order of the Police. I neither &s;aw, nor heard from, any body for &s;ix months; and the only hope that remained to me was, that a new mini&s;ter would arrive from America to &s;uper-cede Morris, and that he would be authori&s;ed to en|quire into the cau&s;e of my impri&s;onment. But even this hope, in the &s;tate to which matters were daily arriving, was too remote to have any con&s;olatory ef|fect, and I contented my&s;elf with the thought, that I might be remembered when it would be too late. There is perhaps no condition from which a man con&s;cious of his own uprightne&s;s cannot derive con|&s;olation; for it is in it&s;elf a con&s;olation for him to find that he can bear that condition with calmne&s;s and fortitude.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="17">From about the middle of March (1794) to the fall of Robe&s;pierre, 29th July, (9th of Thermidor) the &s;tate of things in the pri&s;on was a continued &s;cene of horror. No man could count upon life for twen|ty hours. To &s;uch a pitch of rage and &s;u&s;picion was Robe&s;pierre and his committee arrived, that it &s;eem|ed as if they feared to leave a man to live. Scarce|ly a night pa&s;&s;ed but in which ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more were taken out of the pri&s;on, carried before a pretended tribunal in the morning, and guillotined before night. One hundred and &s;ix|ty nine were taken out of the Luxembourg in one night in the month of July and one hundred and &s;ixty of them guillotined. A li&s;t of two hundred more, according to the report in the pri&s;on, was preparing a few days before Robe&s;pierre fell. In this la&s;t li&s;t I have good rea&s;on to believe I was included. A memorandum, in the hand writing of Robe&s;pierre, was afterwards produced in the Con|vention, by the committee to whom the papers of Robe&s;pierre were referred, in the&s;e words:</P>
<Q>Demander que Tho|mas Paine &s;oit decret&eacute; d'accu&s;ation, pour l'in|teret de l'Amerique au|tant que de la France.</Q>
<Q>Demand that Thomas Paine be decreed of accu|&s;ation, for the intere&s;t of America as well as of France.</Q>
<P>I had then been impri&s;oned &s;even months, and the
<PB N="18" REF="18">&s;ilence of the executive government of America, Mr. Wa&s;hington, upon the ca&s;e and upon every thing re&s;pecting me, was explanation enough to Robe&s;pierre that he might proceed to extremities.</P>
<P>A violent fever which had nearly terminated my exi&s;tence, was I believe, the circum&s;tance that pre&s;erved it. I was not in a condition to be remov|ed, or to know of what was pa&s;&s;ing, or of what had pa&s;&s;ed for more than a month. It makes a blank in my remembrance of life. The fir&s;t thing I was in|formed of was the fall of Robe&s;pierre.</P>
<P>About a week after this Mr. Monroe arrived to &s;upercede Gouverneur Morris, and as &s;oon as I was able to write a note legible enough to be read, I found a way to convey one to him, by means of the man who lighted the lamps in the pri&s;on; and who&s;e unabated friend&s;hip to me, from whom he had never received any &s;ervice, and with difficulty accepted any recompence, puts the character of Mr. Wa&s;hington to &s;hame.</P>
<P>In a &s;aw days I received a me&s;&s;age from Mr. Monroe, conveyed to me in a note from an inter|mediate per&s;on, with a&s;&s;urance of his friend&s;hip, and expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire that I would re&s;t that ca&s;e in his hands. After a fortnight or more had pa&s;&s;ed and hearing nothing further, I wrote to a friend who was then in Paris, a citizen of Philadelphia, reque&s;ting him to inform me what was the true
<PB N="19" REF="19">&s;ituation of things with re&s;pect to me. I was &s;ure that &s;omething was the matter. I began to have hard thoughts of Mr. Wa&s;hington; but I was un|willing to encourage them.</P>
<P>In about ten days I received an an&s;wer to my let|ter in which the writer &s;ays: <Q>Mr. Monroe has told me that he has no orders (meaning from the pre&s;ident, Mr. Wa&s;hington) re&s;pecting you, but that he (Mr. Monroe) will do every thing in his power to liberate you; but from what I learn from the Americans lately arrived in Paris, you are not con&s;idered, either by the American govern|ment or by the individuals, as an American citizen.</Q></P>
<P>I was now at no lo&s;s to under&s;tand Mr. Wa&s;h|ington and his new fangled faction, and that their policy was &s;ilently to leave me to fall in France. They were ru&s;hing as fa&s;t as they could venture, without awakening the jealou&s;y of America, into all the vices and corruptions of the Briti&s;h govern|ment; and it was no more con&s;i&s;tent with the po|licy of Mr. Wa&s;hington, and tho&s;e who immedi|ately &s;urrounded him, than it was with that of Ro|be&s;pierre or of Pitt, that I &s;hould &s;urvive. They have however, mi&s;&s;ed the mark and the reaction is upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Upon the receipt of the letter ju&s;t alluded to, I &s;ent a memorial to Mr. Monroe which the reader will find in the appendix, and I received from him
<PB N="20" REF="20">the following an&s;wer. It is dated the 18th of Sep|tember, but did not come to hand till about the 10th of October. I was then falling into a relap&s;e, the weather was becoming damp and cold, fuel was not to be had, and the ab&s;ce&s;s in my &s;ide, the con&s;equence of the&s;e things, and of the want of air and exerci&s;e, was beginning to form and which has continued im|moveable ever &s;ince. Here follows Mr. Monroe's letter.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I was favoured &s;oon after my arrival here with &s;everal letters from you and more latterly with one in the character of memorial, upon the &s;ubject of your confinement; and &s;hould have an&s;wered them at the times they were re&s;pectively written had I not con|cluded you would have calculated with certainty upon the deep intere&s;t I take in your welfare and the plea&s;ure with which I &s;hall embrace every opportu|nity in my power to &s;erve you. I &s;hould &s;till pur&s;ue the &s;ame cour&s;e, and for rea&s;ons which mu&s;t obvi|ou&s;ly occur, if I did not find that you are di&s;quieted with apprehen&s;ions upon intere&s;ting points, &amp; which ju&s;tice to you and our country equally forbid you &s;hould entertain. You mention that you have been informed you are not con&s;idered as an American citi|zen by the Americans, and that you have likewi&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="21">heard that I had no in&s;tructions re&s;pecting you by the government. I doubt not the per&s;on who gave you the information meant well, but I &s;u&s;pect he did not even convey accurately his own ideas on the fir&s;t point; for I pre&s;ume the mo&s;t he could &s;ay is that you had likewi&s;e become a French citizen and which by no means deprived you of being an American one. Even this however may be doubted, I mean the ac|qui&s;ition of citizen&s;hip in France, and I confe&s;s you have &s;aid much to &s;hew that it has not been made. I really &s;u&s;pect that this was all that the gentleman who wrote you, and tho&s;e Americans he heard &s;peak upon the &s;ubject, meant. It becomes my duty however to declare to you, that I con&s;ider you as an American citizen, and that you are con&s;idered uni|ver&s;ally in that character by the people of America. As &s;uch you are entitled to my attention; and &s;o far as it can be given con&s;i&s;tently with tho&s;e obliga|tions which are mutual between every government and even a tran&s;ient pa&s;&s;enger you &s;hall receive it.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s have never decided upon the &s;ubject of citizen&s;hip in a manner to regard the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. By being with us through the revolution you are of our country as ab&s;olutely as if you had been born there, and you are no more of England than every native American is. This is the true doctrine in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;o far as it becomes complicated with any other con&s;ideration. I have mentioned it
<PB N="22" REF="22">to make you ea&s;y upon the only point which could give you any di&s;quietude.</P>
<P>Is it nece&s;&s;ary for me to tell you how much all your countrymen, I &s;peak of the great ma&s;s of the people, are intere&s;ted in your welfare? They have not for|gotten the hi&s;tory of their own revolution and the difficult &s;cenes through which they pa&s;&s;ed; nor do they review its &s;everal &s;tages without reviving in their bo&s;oms a due &s;en&s;ibility of the merits of tho&s;e who &s;erved them in that great and arduous conflict The crime of ingratitude has not yet &s;tained, and I tru&s;t never will &s;tain, our national character. You are con&s;idered by them as not only having rendered important &s;ervices in our own revolution, but as be|ing, on a more exten&s;ive &s;cale, the friend of hu|man rights, and a di&s;tingui&s;hed, an able, advocate in favour of public liberty. To the welfare of Thomas Paine the Americans are not, nor can they be, indif|ferent.</P>
<P>Of the &s;en&s;e which the Pre&s;ident has always en|tertained of your merits, and of his friendly di&s;po|&s;ition towards you, you are too well a&s;&s;ured to re|quire any declaration of it from me. That I forward his wi&s;hes in &s;eeking your &s;afety is what I well know, and this will form an additional obligation on me to perform what I &s;hould otherwi&s;e con&s;ider as a duty.</P>
<P>You are, in my opinion, at pre&s;ent, menaced by no kind of danger. To liberate you will be the ob|ject
<PB N="23" REF="23">of my endeavours, and as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. But you mu&s;t, until that event &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, bear your &s;ituation with patience and fortitude. You will likewi&s;e have the ju&s;tice to recollect, that I am placed here upon a difficult theatre,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This I pre&s;ume alludes to the embarra&s;&s;ments which the &s;trange conduct of Gouv. Morris had occa&s;ioned, and which, I well know, had created &s;u&s;picions upon the &s;incerity of Mr. Wa&s;hington.</NOTE> many impor|tant objects to attend to, with few to con&s;ult. It be|comes me in pur&s;uit of tho&s;e to regulate my conduct in re&s;pect to each, as to the manner and the time, as will, in my judgment, be be&s;t calculated to accompli&s;h the whole. With great e&s;teem and re&s;pect con&s;ider me per&s;onally your friend.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The part in Mr. Monroe's letter in which he &s;peaks of the Pre&s;ident (Mr. Wa&s;hington) is put in &s;oft lan|guage. Mr. Monroe knew what Mr. Wa&s;hington had &s;aid formerly, and he was willing to keep that in view. But the fact is, not only that Mr. Wa&s;hing|ton had given no orders to Mr. Monroe, as the letter &s;tated; but he did not &s;o much as &s;ay to him, en|quire if Mr. Paine be dead or alive, in pri&s;on or out, or &s;ee if there is any a&s;&s;i&s;tance we can given him.</P>
<P>While the&s;e matters were pa&s;&s;ing the liberations from the pri&s;ons were numerous; from twenty to forty in the cour&s;e of almo&s;t every twenty four hours.
<PB N="24" REF="24">The continuance of my impri&s;onment, after a new mini&s;ter had arrived immediately from America, which was now more than two months, was a mat|ter &s;o obviou&s;ly &s;trange, that I found the character of the American government &s;poken of in very unqua|lified terms of reproach; not only by tho&s;e who &s;till remained in pri&s;on, but by tho&s;e who were liberated, and by per&s;ons who had acce&s;s to the pri&s;on from without. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances I wrote again to Mr. Monroe, and found occa&s;ion, among o|ther things to &s;ay: <Q>It will not add to the popula|rity of Mr. Wa&s;hington to have it believed in Ame|rica, as it is believed here, that he connives at my impri&s;onment.</Q></P>
<P>The ca&s;e, &s;o far as it re&s;pected Mr. Monroe was, that having to get over the difficulties which the &s;trange conduct of Gouverneur Morris had thrown in the way of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and having no authority from the American government to &s;peak officially upon any thing relating to me, he found him&s;elf obliged to proceed by unofficial means with individual mem|bers; for though Robe&s;pierre was overthrown, the Robe&s;pierrian members of the Committee of Public Safety &s;till remained in con&s;iderable force, and had they found out that Mr. Monroe had no official au|thority upon the ca&s;e, they would have paid little or no regard to his reclamation of me. In the mean time my health was &s;uffering exceedingly, the dreary
<PB N="25" REF="25">pro&s;pect of winter was coming on, and impri&s;on|ment was &s;till a thing of danger.</P>
<P>After the Robe&s;pierrian members of the Committee were removed by the expiration of their time of &s;erving, Mr. Monroe reclaimed me, and I was libe|rated the 4th of November. Mr. Monroe arrived in Paris the beginning of Augu&s;t before. All the pe|riod of my impri&s;onment, at lea&s;t, I owe not to Ro|be&s;pierre, but to his colleague in projects, George Wa&s;hington. Immediately upon my liberation Mr. Monroe invited me to his hou&s;e, where I remained more than a year and an half; and I &s;peak of his aid and his friend&s;hip, as an open hearted man will al|ways do in &s;uch a ca&s;e, with re&s;pect and gratitude.</P>
<P>Soon after my liberation the Convention pa&s;&s;ed an unanimous vote to invite me to return to my &s;eat among them. The times were &s;till un&s;ettled and dangerous, as well from without as from within, for the coalition was unbroken, and the con&s;titution not &s;ettled. I cho&s;e, however, to accept the invi|tation; for as I undertake nothing but what I be|lieve to be right, I abandon nothing that I under|take; and I was willing al&s;o to &s;hew, that, as I was not of a ca&s;t of mind to be deterred by pro&s;pects or retro-pro&s;pects of danger, &s;o neither were my prin|ciples to be weakened by misfortune, or perverted by di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="26">Being now once more abroad in the world I be|gan to find that I was not the only one who had conceived an unfavourable opinion of Mr. Wa&s;h|ington. It was evident that his character was on the decline as well among Americans as among fo|reigners of different nations. From being the chief of a government, he had made him&s;elf the chief of a party; and his integrity was que&s;tioned, for his politics had a doubtful appearance. The mi&s;&s;ion of Mr. Jay to London, notwith&s;tanding there was an American mini&s;ter there already, had then taken place, and was beginning to be talked of. It ap|peared to others, as it did to me, to be enveloped in my&s;tery, which every day &s;erved either to en|crea&s;e or to explain into matter of &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>In the year 1790, or about that time, Mr. Wa&s;h|ington as Pre&s;ident had &s;ent Gouverneur Morris to London as his &s;ecret agent to have &s;ome communi|cation with the Briti&s;h mini&s;try. To cover the a|gency of Morris it was given out, I know not by whom, that he went as an agent from Robert Mor|ris to borrow money in Europe, and the report was permitted to pa&s;s uncontradicted. The event of Mor|ris's negociation was, that Mr. Hammond was &s;ent mini&s;ter from England to America, and Pinckney from America to England, and him&s;elf mini&s;ter to France. If while Morris was mini&s;ter in France he was not an emi&s;&s;ary of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try and the
<PB N="27" REF="27">coale&s;ced powers, he gave &s;trong rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect him of it. No one who &s;aw his conduct, and heard his conver&s;ation, could doubt his being in their in|tere&s;t; and had he not got off at the time he did, after his recall, he would have been in arre&s;tation. Some letters of his had fallen into the hands of the Committee of Public Safety, and enquiry was mak|ing after him.</P>
<P>A great bu&s;tle has been made by Mr. Wa&s;hing|ton about the conduct of Genet in America; while that of his own mini&s;ter, Morris, in France was in|finitely more reproachable. If Genet was impru|dent or ra&s;h, he was not treacherous; but Morris was all three. He was the enemy of the French re|volution in every &s;tage of it. But, notwith&s;tanding this conduct on the part of Morris, and the known profligacy of his character, Mr. Wa&s;hington, in a let|ter he wrote to him at the time of recalling him on the complaint and reque&s;t of the Committee of Public Safety, a&s;&s;ures him, that though he had complied with that reque&s;t, he &s;till retained he &s;ame e&s;teem and friend&s;hip for him as before. This letter Mor|ris was fooli&s;h enough to tell of; and, as his own character and conduct were notorious, the telling of it could have but one effect, which was that of im|plicating the character of the writer. Morris &s;till loiters in Europe, chiefly in England; and Mr. Wa&s;hington is &s;till in corre&s;pondence with him;
<PB N="28" REF="28">Mr. Wa&s;hington ought therefore to expect, e&s;peci|ally &s;ince his conduct in the affair of Jay's treaty, that France mu&s;t con&s;ider Morris and Wa&s;hington as men of the &s;ame de&s;cription. The chief differ|ence, however, between the two is (for in politics there is none) that the one is profligate enough to profe&s;s an indifference about <HI>moral</HI> principles, and the other is prudent enough to conceal the want of them.</P>
<P>About three months after I was at liberty, the official note of Jay to Grenville on the &s;ubject of the capture of American ve&s;&s;els by Briti&s;h crui&s;ers appeared in the American papers that arrived at Paris. Every thing was of a-piece. Every thing was mean. The &s;ame kind of character went to all circum&s;tances public or private. Di&s;gu&s;ted at this national degradation, as well as at the particu|lar conduct of Mr. Wa&s;hington to me, I wrote to him (Mr. Wa&s;hington) on the 22d of February (1795) under cover to the then Secretary of State (Mr. Randolph) and entru&s;ted the letter to Mr. Letombe, who was appointed French con&s;ul to Phi|ladelphia, and was on the point of taking his de|parture. When I &s;uppo&s;ed Mr. Letombe had &s;ailed, I mentioned the letter to Mr. Monroe, and as I was then in his hou&s;e, I &s;hewed it to him. He expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h that i would recall it, which he &s;uppo&s;ed migh be done, as he had learned that Mr. Letombe
<PB N="29" REF="29">had not then failed. I agreed to do &s;o, and it was returned by Mr. Letombe under cover to Mr. Mon|roe.</P>
<P>The letter, however, will now reach Mr. Wa&s;h|ington publicly in the cour&s;e of this work.</P>
<P>About the month of September following, I had a &s;evere relap&s;e, which gave occa&s;ion to the report of my death. I had felt it coming on a con&s;iderable time before, which occa&s;ioned me to ha&s;ten the work I had then on hand, the <HI>Second part of the Age of Rea&s;on.</HI> When I had fini&s;hed that work, I be&s;towed another letter on Mr. Wa&s;hington, which I &s;ent under cover to Mr. Benj. Franklin Bache of Philadelphia. The letter is as follows.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I had written you a letter by Mr. Letombe, French con&s;ul, but at the reque&s;t of Mr. Monroe I withdrew it, and the letter is &s;till by me. I was the more ea&s;ily prevailed upon to do this, as it was then my intention to have returned to America the latter end of the pre&s;ent year, 1795; but the illne&s;s I now &s;uffer prevents me. In ca&s;e I had come, I &s;hould
<PB N="30" REF="30">have applied to you for &s;uch parts of your official letters (and of your private ones, if you had cho&s;en to give them) as contained any in&s;tructions or di|rections either to Mr. Monroe, or to Mr. Morris, or to any other per&s;on re&s;pecting me; for, after you were informed of my impri&s;onment in France, it was incumbent on you to have made &s;ome enquiry into the cau&s;e, as you might very well conclude, that I had not the opportunity of informing you of it. I cannot under&s;tand your &s;ilence upon this &s;ub|ject upon any other ground, than as connivance at my impri&s;onment; and this is the manner it is un|der&s;tood here, and will be under&s;tood in America, unle&s;s you can give me authority for contradicting it. I therefore write you this letter, to propo&s;e to you to &s;end me copies of any letters you have written, that may remove that &s;u&s;picion. In the pre|face to the &s;econd part of the Age of Rea&s;on, I have given a memorandum from the hand writing of Ro|be&s;pierre, in which he propo&s;ed decree of accu&s;a|tion again&s;t me, <HI>"for the intere&s;t of America as well as of France."</HI> He could have no cau&s;e for putting America into the ca&s;e, but by interpreting the &s;i|lence of the American government into connivance and con&s;ent. I was impri&s;oned on the ground of being born in England; and your &s;ilence in not en|quiring into the cau&s;e of that impri&s;onment and re|claiming me again&s;t it, was tacitly giving me up.
<PB N="31" REF="31">I ought not to have &s;u&s;pected you of treachery; but whether I recover from the illne&s;s I now &s;uffer or not, I &s;hall continue to think you treacherous, till you give me cau&s;e to think otherwi&s;e. I am &s;ure you would have found your&s;elf more at your ea&s;e had you acted by me as you ought; for, whether your de&s;ertion of me was intended to gratify the Engli&s;h government, or to let me fall into de&s;truc|tion in France, that you might exclaim the louden again&s;t the French revolution, or whether you hoped by my extinction to meet with le&s;s oppo&s;ition in mounting up the American government,&mdash;either of the&s;e will involve you in reproach you will not ea&s;ily &s;hake off.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As it is always painful to reproach tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would wi&s;h to re&s;pect, it is not without &s;ome difficulty that I have taken the re&s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ion to write to you.
<PB N="32" REF="32">The dangers to which I have been expo&s;ed cannot have been unknown to you, and the guarded &s;ilence you have ob&s;erved upon that circum&s;tance is what I ought not to have expected from you, either as a friend or as Pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>
<P>You know enough of my character to be a&s;&s;ured, that I could not have de&s;erved impri&s;onment in France, and without knowing any thing more than this, you had &s;ufficient ground to have taken &s;ome intere&s;t for my &s;afety. Every motive ari&s;ing from recollection of times pa&s;t, ought to have &s;ugge&s;ted to you the propriety of &s;uch a mea&s;ure. But I cannot find that you have &s;o much as directed any enquiry to be made, whether I was in pri&s;on or at liberty, dead or alive; what the cau&s;e of that impri&s;onment was, or whether there was any &s;ervice or a&s;&s;i&s;tance you could render. Is this what I ought to have expected from America after the part I have acted towards her, or will it redound to her honour or to yours, that I tell the &s;tory. I do not he&s;itate to &s;ay, that you have not &s;erved America with more di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s nor greater zeal, nor more fidelity, than my&s;elf, and I know not if with better effect. After the revolution of America was e&s;tabli&s;hed I ventured into new &s;cenes of difficulties to extend the principles which that revolution had produced, and you re&s;ted at home to partake of the advantages. In the proge&s;s of events you beheld your&s;elf a Pre&s;ident in Ameaica
<PB N="33" REF="33">and me a pri&s;oner in France. You folded your arms, forgot your friend, and became &s;ilent.</P>
<P>As every thing I have been doing in Europe was connected with my wi&s;hes for the pro&s;perity of Ame|rica, I ought to be the more &s;urpri&s;ed at this conduct on the part of her government. It leaves me but one mode of explanation, which is, <HI>that every thing is not as it ought to be among&s;t you,</HI> and that the pre&s;ence of a man who might di&s;approve, and who had credit enough with the Country to be heard and believed, was not wi&s;hed for. This was the operating motive with the de&s;potic faction that impri&s;oned me in France (tho' the pretence was, that I was a foreigner) and tho&s;e that have been &s;ilent and inactive towards me in America, appear to me to have acted from the &s;ame motive, of wi&s;hing me out of the way. It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to di&s;cover any other.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the part I have acted in the revolution of America it is natural that I feel intere&s;ted in whatever relates to her character and pro&s;perity. Though I am not on the &s;pot, to &s;ee what is immedi|ately acting there, I &s;ee &s;ome part of what &s;he is acting in Europe. For your own &s;ake, as well as for that of America, I was both &s;urpri&s;ed and concerr|ed at the appointment of Gouverneur Morris to be mini&s;ter to France. His conduct has proved that the opinion I had formed of that appointment was well founded. I wrote that opinion to Mr. Jeffer&s;on
<PB N="34" REF="34">at the time, and I was frank enough to &s;ay the &s;ame thing to Morris&mdash;<HI>that it was an unfortunate appoint|ment.</HI> His prating, in&s;ignificant pompo&s;ity, rendered him at once offen&s;ive, &s;u&s;pected, and ridiculous; and his total neglect of all bu&s;ine&s;s had &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted the Americans, that they propo&s;ed entering a prote&s;t again&s;t him. He carried this neglect to &s;uch an extreme, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to inform him of it, and I a&s;ked him one day if he did not feel him&s;elf a&s;hamed to take the money of the country and do nothing for it. But Morris is &s;o fond of profit and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s that he cares nothing about character. Had he not been removed at the time he was, I think his conduct would have precipitated the two coun|tries into a rupture; and in this ca&s;e, hated <HI>&s;y&s;temati|cally,</HI> as America is and ever will be by the Briti&s;h government, and &s;u&s;pected by France, the com|merce of America would have fallen a prey to both countries.</P>
<P>If the incon&s;i&s;tent conduct of Morris expo&s;ed the intere&s;t of America to &s;ome hazard in France, the pu&s;illanimous conduct of Mr. Jay in England has rendered the character of the American government contemptible in Europe. Is it po&s;&s;ible that any man who has contributed to the independence of Ame|rica, and to free her from the tyranny and inju&s;tice of the Briti&s;h government, can read, without &s;hame and indignation, the note of Jay to Grenville.
<PB N="35" REF="35">It is a &s;atire upon the declaration of Indepen|dence, and an encouragement to the Briti&s;h government to treat America with contempt. At the time this mini&s;ter of petitions was acting this mi&s;erable part, he had every means in his hands to enable him to have done his bu&s;ine&s;s as he ought. The &s;ucce&s;s or failure of his mi&s;&s;ion depended upon the &s;ucce&s;s or failure of the French arms. Had France failed, Mr. Jay might have put his humble petition in his pocket and gone home. The ca&s;e happened to be otherwi&s;e, and he has &s;acrificed the honour and perhaps all the advantages of it, by turn|ing petitioner. I take it for granted, that he was &s;ent to demand indemnification for the captured property; and in this ca&s;e, if he thought he wanted a preamble to his demand, he might have &s;aid: <Q>That tho' the government of England might &s;up|po&s;e it&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eizing American property bound to France, yet that &s;uppo&s;ed ne|ce&s;&s;ity could not preclude indemnification to the proprietors, who, acting under the authority of their own government, were not accountable to any other.</Q>&mdash;But Mr. Jay &s;ets out with an implied recognition of the right of the Briti&s;h government to &s;eize and condemn; for he enters his complaint again&s;t the <HI>irregularity</HI> of the &s;eizures and the condem|nation, as if they were reprehen&s;ible only by not being <HI>conformable</HI> to the <HI>terms</HI> of the proclamation
<PB N="36" REF="36">under which they were &s;eized. In&s;tead of being the Envoy of a government he goes over like a lawyer to demand a new trial. I can hardly help believing, that Grenville wrote the note him&s;elf and Jay &s;igned it, for the &s;tile of it is dome&s;tic and not diplomatic. The term, <HI>His</HI> Maje&s;ty, u&s;ed without any de&s;criptive epithet, always &s;ignifies the king whom the Mini&s;ter that &s;peaks repre&s;ents. If this &s;inking of the demand into a petition was a jug|gle between Grenville and Jay, to cover the in|demnification, I think it will end in another juggle, that of never paying the money, and be made u&s;e of afterwards to preclude the right of demanding it; for Mr. Jay has virtually di&s;owned the right, <HI>by ap|pealing to the magnanimity of his Maje&s;ty again&s;t the capturers.</HI> He has appointed this magnanimous Maje&s;ty to be umpire in the ca&s;e, and the govern|ment of the United States mu&s;t abide by the deci|&s;ion. If, Sir, I turn &s;ome part of this affair into ridicule, it is to avoid the unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation of &s;erious indignation.</P>
<P>Among other things, which I confe&s;s I do not un|der&s;tand, is the proclamation of neutrality. This has always appeared to me as an a&s;&s;umption on the part of the executive not warranted by the con&s;titu|tion. But pa&s;&s;ing this over, as a di&s;putable ca&s;e, and con&s;idering it only as political, the con&s;equence has been that of &s;u&s;taining the lo&s;&s;es of war without the
<PB N="37" REF="37">balance of repri&s;als. When the profe&s;&s;ion of neutrali|ty on the part of America was an&s;wered by ho&s;tilities on the part of Britain, the object and intention of that neutrality exi&s;ted no longer, and to maintain it after this was not only to encourage further in&s;ults and depredations, but was an informal breach of neutrality towards France, by pa&s;&s;ively contributing to the aid of her enemy. That the government of England con&s;idered the American government as pu&s;illanimous is evident from the encrea&s;ing in&s;o|lence of the former towards the latter, till the affair of General Wayne. She then &s;aw it might be po&s;&s;ible to kick a government into &s;ome degree of &s;pirit. So far as the proclamation of neutrality was intend|ed to prevent a di&s;&s;olute &s;pirit of privateering in Ame|rica under foreign colours, it was undoubtedly lauda|ble; but to continue it as a government neutrality, after the commerce of the country was made war upon, was &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and not neutrality. I have heard &s;o much about this thing called neutra|lity, that I know not if the ungenerous and di&s;ho|norable &s;ilence (for I mu&s;t call it &s;uch) that has been ob&s;erved by your part of the government towards me, during my impri&s;onment, has not in &s;ome mea&s;ure ari&s;en from that policy.</P>
<P>Tho' I have written you this letter, you ought not to &s;uppo&s;e it has been an agreeable undertaking to me. On the contrary, I a&s;&s;ure you, it has co&s;t me

</LETTER>
<P>That this letter was not written in very good tem|per is very evident; but it was ju&s;t &s;uch a letter as his conduct appeared to me to merit, and every thing on his part &s;ince has &s;erved to confirm that opinion. Had I wanted a commentary on his &s;ilence with re&s;pect to my impri&s;onment in France, &s;ome of his faction has furni&s;hed me with it. What I here allude to is a publication in a Philadelphia paper, copied afterwards into a New York paper, both under the patronage of the Wa&s;hington faction, in which the writer, &s;till &s;uppo&s;ing me in pri&s;on in France, wonders at my lengthy re&s;pite from the &s;caffold; and he marks his politics &s;till further by &s;aying: <Q>It appears moreover, that the people of England did not reli&s;h his (Thomas Paine's) opinions quite &s;o well as he expected, and that for one of his la&s;t pieces, as de&s;tructive to the peace and happine&s;s of their country, (meaning, I &s;uppo&s;e, the <HI>Rights of Man)</HI> they threatened our knight-errant with &s;uch &s;erious vengeance, that, to avoid a trip to Botany-bay, he fled over to France, as a le&s;s dangerous voyage.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="39">I am not refuting or contradicting the fal&s;hood of this publication, for it is &s;ufficiently notorious; neither am I cen&s;uring the writer; on the contrary I think him for the explanation he has incautiou&s;ly given of the principles of the Wa&s;hington faction. In&s;ignificant, however, as the piece is, it was capa|ble of having had &s;ome ill effect, had it arrived in France during my impri&s;onment and in the time of Robe&s;pierre; and I am not uncharitable in &s;uppo&s;ing that this was the intention of the writer. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know not who the writer of the piece is; but &s;ome late Americans &s;ay it is Phineas Bond, an American refugee, and now a Briti&s;h Con&s;ul; and that he writes under the &s;ignature of Peter Skunk, or Peter Porcupine, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;ignature.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have now done with Mr. Wa&s;hington on the &s;core of private affairs. It would have been far more agreeable to me, had his conduct been &s;uch as not to have merited the&s;e reproaches. Errors or caprices of the temper can be pardoned and forgot|ten; but a cold deliberate crime of the heart, &s;uch as Mr. Wa&s;hington is capable of acting, is not to be wa&s;hed away. I now proceed to other matter.</P>
<P>After Jay's note to Grenville arrived in Paris from America, the character of every thing that was to follow might be ea&s;ily fore&s;een; and it was upon this anticipation that my letter of February 22d was founded. The event has proved, that I was not mi&s;taken, except that it has been much wor&s;e than I expected.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="40">It would naturally occur to Mr. Wa&s;hington, that the &s;ecrecy of Jay's mi&s;&s;ion to England, where there was already an American mini&s;ter, could not but create &s;ome &s;u&s;picion in the French government; e&s;pecially as the conduct of Morris had been noto|rious, and the intimacy of Mr. Wa&s;hington with Morris was known.</P>
<P>The character which Mr. Wa&s;hington has at|tempted to act in the world, is a &s;ort of non-de&s;criba|ble, cameleon-coloured thing, called <HI>prudence.</HI> It is, in many ca&s;es, a &s;ub&s;titute for principle, and is &s;o nearly allied to hypocri&s;y, that it ea&s;ily &s;lides into it. His genius for prudence furni&s;hed him in this in&s;tance with an expedient, that &s;erved, as is the natural and general character of all expe|dients, to dimini&s;h the embarra&s;&s;ments of the moment and multiply them afterwards; for he authori&s;ed it to be made known to the French go|vernment, as a confidential matter (Mr. Wa&s;hington &s;hould recollect that I was a member of the Conven|tion, &amp; had the means of knowing what I here &s;tate) he authorized it, I &s;ay, to be made known, and that for the purpo&s;e of preventing any unea&s;ine&s;s to France on the &s;core of Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion to England, that the object of that mi&s;&s;ion, and of Mr. Jay's authority, was re&s;tricted to that of demanding the &s;urrender of the we&s;tern po&s;ts and indemnification for the cargoes captured in American ve&s;&s;els. Mr. Wa&s;hington knows
<PB N="41" REF="41">that this was untrue; and knowing this, he had good rea&s;on to him&s;elf for refu&s;ing to furni&s;h the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives with copies of the in&s;tructions given to Jay; as the might &s;u&s;pect, among other things, that he &s;hould al&s;o be called upon for copies of in&s;tructions given to other mini&s;ters, and that in the contradiction of in&s;tructions his want of integrity would be detected. Mr. Wa&s;hington may now, per|haps, learns, when it is too late, to be of any u&s;e to him, that a man will pa&s;s better through the world with a thou&s;and open errors upon his bank, than in being detected in ONE &s;ly fal&s;hood. When one is detected, a thou&s;and are &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t account that arrived in Paris of a treaty being negociated by Mr. Jay (for nobody &s;u&s;pected any) came in an Engli&s;h new&s;paper, which announ|ced that a treaty <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> and <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> had been con|cluded between the United States of America and England. This was immediately denied by every American in Paris, as an impo&s;&s;ible thing; and though it was di&s;believed by the French, it imprinted a &s;u&s;|picion that &s;ome underhand bu&s;ine&s;s was going for|ward. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was the embarra&s;&s;ment into which the affairs and credit of America were thrown at this in&s;tant by the report above alluded to, that made it nece&s;&s;ary to contradict it, and that by every means, ari&s;ing from opinion or founded upon authority. The Committee of Public Safety, exi&s;ting at that time, had agreed to the full execution, on their part, of the treats between America and France, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome equivocal conduction the part of the American government, not very con&s;i&s;tent with the good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">th of an ally, but they were not in di&s;position to be impo&s;ed upon by a counter-treaty. That Jay had no in&s;tructions beyond the points above &s;tated, or none that could po&s;&s;ibly be con&s;trued to extend to the length the British treat goes, was a matter be|lieved in America, in England and in France; and without go|ing to any other foreca&s;t followed naturally from the me&s;&s;age of the Pre&s;ident to Congre&s;s, when he nominated Jay upon that mi&s;&s;ion. The &s;ecretary of Mr. Jay came to Paris &s;oon after the treaty with England had been con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uded. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> brought with him a copy of Mr. Jay's in&s;truction, which he offered to &s;hew to me as a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Jay.</HI> I advised him, as a friend, not to &s;hew them to any body, and did not permit him to &s;hew them to me. Who is i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to him, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> intend to implicate as cen&s;ureable by &s;hewing, tho&s;e in&s;tructions? Perhaps that implication may full upon your own government. Though I did not &s;ee the in&s;tructions I could not be at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand, that the American admin&s;|traties had been playing a double game.</NOTE> At length the treaty it&s;elf arrived, and every well-affected American blu&s;hed with &s;hame.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="42">It is curious to ob&s;erve how the appearances of character will change, whil&s;t the root that produces them remains the &s;ame. The Wa&s;hington admini&s;|tration having waded through the &s;lough of negoci|ation, and whil&s;t it amu&s;ed France with profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip contrived to injure her, immediately throws off the hypocrite, and a&s;&s;umes the &s;wagger|ing air of a bravado. The party papers of that imbecile admini&s;tration were on this occa&s;ion filled with paragraphs about <HI>Sovereignty.</HI> A paltroon may boa&s;t of his &s;overeign right to let another kick him, and this is the only kind of &s;overeignty &s;hewn in the treaty with England. But the&s;e da&s;hing paragraphs, as Timothy Pickering well knows, were intended for France; without who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance in men, money and
<PB N="43" REF="43">&s;hips, Mr. Wa&s;hington would have cut but a poor figure in the American war. But of his military ta|lents I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter.</P>
<P>I mean not to enter into any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of any ar|ticle of Jay's treaty: I &s;hall &s;peak only upon the whole of it. It is attempted to be ju&s;tified on the ground of its not being a violation of any article or articles of the treaty pre-exi&s;ting with France. But the &s;o|vereign right of explanation does not lie with George Wa&s;hington and his man Timothy; France, on her part, has, at lea&s;t, an equal right; and when nations di&s;pute, it is not &s;o much about words as about things.</P>
<P>A man, &s;uch as the world calls, a &s;harper, and ver&s;ed, as Jay mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, in the quibbles of the law, may find a way to enter into engage|ments, and make bargains in &s;uch a manner as to cheat &s;ome other party, without that party being able, as the phra&s;e is, <HI>to take the law of him.</HI> This often happens in the cabali&s;tical circle of what is called law. But when this is attempted to be acted on the national &s;cale of treaties, it is too de&s;picable to be defended, or to be permitted to exi&s;t. Yet this is the trick upon which Jay's treaty is founded, &s;o far as it has relation to the treaty pre-exi&s;ting with France. It is a counter-treaty to that treaty, and perverts all the great articles of that treaty to the injury of France, and makes them operate as a bounty to England with whom France is at war.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="44">The Wa&s;hington admini&s;tration &s;hews great de|&s;ire, that the treaty between France and the United States be pre&s;erved. Nobody can doubt their &s;ince|rity upon this matter. There is not a Briti&s;h mini&s;|ter, a Briti&s;h merchant, or a Briti&s;h agent or &s;ailor in America, that does not anxiou&s;ly wi&s;h the &s;ame thing. The treaty with France &s;erves now as a pa&s;&s;port to &s;upply England with naval &s;tores and other articles of American produce, whil&s;t the &s;ame articles, when coming to France, are made contraband or &s;eizable by Jay's treaty with England. The treaty with France &s;ays, that neutral &s;hips make neutral pro|perty on board American &s;hips; and Jay's treaty delivers up French property on board American &s;hips to be &s;eized by the Engli&s;h. It is too paltry to talk of faith, of national honour, and of the preserva|tion of treaties, whil&s;t &s;uch a bare-faced treachery as this &s;tares the world in the face.</P>
<P>The Wa&s;hington admini&s;tration may &s;ave it&s;elf the trouble of proving to the French government its <HI>mo&s;t faithful</HI> intentions of pre&s;erving the treaty with France; for France has now no de&s;ire chat it &s;hould be pre&s;erved. She had nominated an Envoy extra|ordinary to America, to make Mr. Wa&s;hington and his government a pre&s;ent of the treaty, and to have no more to do with <HI>that</HI> or with <HI>him.</HI> It was, at the &s;ame time, officially declared to the American mi|ni&s;ter
<PB N="45" REF="45">at Paris, <HI>that the French Republic had rather have the American government for an open enemy than a treacherous friend.</HI> This, &s;ir, together with the internal di&s;tractions cau&s;ed in America, and the lo&s;e of character in the world, is the <HI>eventful cri&s;is,</HI> alluded to in the beginning of this letter, to which your double politics have brought the affairs of your country. It is time that the eyes of America be opened upon you.</P>
<P>How France would have conducted her&s;elf to|wards America and American commerce after all treaty &s;tipulations had cea&s;ed, and under the &s;en&s;e of &s;ervices rendered and injuries received, I know not. It is, however, an unplea&s;ant reflection, that in all national quarrels, the innocent, and even the friendly, part of the community, become involved with the culpable and the unfriendly; and as the accounts that arrived from America continued to manife&s;t an invariable attachment in the general ma&s;s of the people to their original ally, in oppo&s;ition to the new-fangled Wa&s;hington faction,&mdash;the re&s;o|lutions that had been taken were &s;u&s;pended. It happened al&s;o fortunately enough, that Gouverneur Morris was not mini&s;ter at this time.</P>
<P>There is, however, one point that yet remains in embryo, and which, among other things, &s;erves to &s;hew the ignorance of the Wa&s;hington treaty-mak|ers, and their inattention to pre-exi&s;ting treaties
<PB N="46" REF="46">when they were employing them&s;elves in framing of ratifying the new treaty with England.</P>
<P>The &s;econd article of the treaty of commerce between the United States and France &s;ays: <Q>The mo&s;t chri&s;tian king and the United States engage mutually, not to grant any particular favour to other nations in re&s;pect of commerce and naviga|tion that &s;hall not immediately become common to the other party, who &s;hall enjoy the &s;ame fa|vour freely, if the conce&s;&s;ion was freely made, or on allowing the &s;ame compen&s;ation if the con|ce&s;&s;ion was conditional.</Q></P>
<P>All the conce&s;&s;ions therefore made to England by Jay's treaty are, through the medium of this &s;econd article in the pre-exi&s;ting treaty, made to France, and become engrafted into the treaty with France, and can be exerci&s;ed by her as a matter of right, the &s;ame as by England.</P>
<P>Jay's treaty makes a conce&s;&s;ion to England, and that unconditionally, of &s;eizing naval &s;tores in Ame|rican &s;hips and condemning them as contraband. It makes al&s;o a conce&s;&s;ion to England to &s;eize pro|vi&s;ions and <HI>other articles</HI> in American &s;hips. <HI>Other articles</HI> are <HI>all other articles,</HI> and none but an ignoramus, or &s;omething wor&s;e, would have put &s;uch a phra&s;e into a treaty. The condition annex|ed to this ca&s;e is, that the provi&s;ions and other ar|ticles &s;o &s;eized are to be paid for at a price to be a|greed
<PB N="47" REF="47">upon. Mr. Wa&s;hington, as Pre&s;ident, ratifi|ed this treaty after he knew the Briti&s;h government had recommenced an indi&s;criminate &s;eizure of pro|vi&s;ions and of all other articles in American &s;hips; and it is now known that tho&s;e &s;eizures were made to fit out the expedition going to Quiberon Bay, and it was known, before hand that they would be made. The evidence goes, al&s;o, a good way to prove that Jay and Grenville under&s;tood each other upon that &s;ubject. Mr. Pinckney, when he pa&s;&s;ed through France on his way to Spain, &s;poke of the recommencement of the &s;eizures as a thing that would take place. The French government had by &s;ome means received information from London to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, with the addition, that the re|commencement of the &s;eizures would cau&s;e no mi&s;|under&s;tanding between the Briti&s;h and American governments. Grenville, in defending him&s;elf a|gain&s;t the oppo&s;ition in Parliament on account of the &s;carcity of corn, &s;aid (&s;ee his &s;peech at the open|ing of the Parliament that met Oct. 29th 1795) that <HI>the &s;upplies for the Quiberon expedition were fur|ni&s;hed out of the American &s;hips;</HI> and all the accounts received at that time from England &s;tated, that tho&s;e &s;eizures were made under the treaty. After the &s;upplies for the Quiberon expedition had been pro|cured and the expected &s;ucce&s;s had failed, the &s;eiz|ures were counter manded; and, had the French
<PB N="48" REF="48">&s;eized provi&s;ion ve&s;&s;els going to England, it is pro|bable that the Quiberon expedition could not have been attempted.</P>
<P>In one point of view, the treaty with England o|perates as a loan to the Engli&s;h government. It gives permi&s;&s;ion to that government to take Ameri|can can property at &s;ea to any amount and pay for it when it &s;uits her; and besides this, the treaty is in every point of view a &s;urrender of the rights of American commerce and navigation, and a refu&s;al to France of the rights of neutrality. The Ameri|can flag is not now a neutral flag to France: Jay's treaty of &s;urrender gives a monopoly of it to Eng|land.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the treaty of commerce be|tween America and France was formed on the mo&s;t liberal principles, and calculated to give the great|e&s;t encouragement to the infant commerce of Ame|rica. France was neither a carrier nor an exporter of naval &s;tores or of provi&s;ions. Tho&s;e articles be|longed wholly to America, and they had all the protection in that treaty which a treaty could give. But &s;o much has that treaty been perverted, that the liberality of it, on the part of France, has &s;erv|ed to encourage Jay to form a counter-treaty with England; for the mu&s;t have &s;uppo&s;ed the hands of France tied up by her treaty with America, when he was making &s;uch large conce&s;&s;ions in favour of
<PB N="49" REF="49">England. The injury which Mr. Wa&s;hington's ad|mini&s;tration has done to the character as well as to the commerce of America is too great to be repair|ed by him. Foreign nations will be &s;hy of making treaties with a government that has given the faith|le&s;s example of perverting the liberality of a former treaty to the injury of the party with whom it was made.</P>
<P>In what a fraudulent light mu&s;t Mr. Wa&s;hing|ton's character appear in the world, when his de|clarations and his conduct are compared together! Here follows the letter he wrote to the Committee of Public Safety whil&s;t Jay was negociating in pro|found &s;ecrecy this treacherous treaty.</P>

It was calculated to remove from the mind of the Committee all &s;u&s;picion upon Jay's mi&s;&s;ion to England, and, in this point of view, it was &s;uited to the cir|cum&s;tances of the moment then pa&s;&s;ing; but as the event of that mi&s;&s;ion has proved the letter to be hy|pocritical, it &s;erves no other purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent moment than to &s;hew that the writer is not to be credited. Two circum&s;tances &s;erved to make the reading of the letter nece&s;&s;ary in the Convention. The one was, that tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded on the fall of Robe&s;pierre, found it mo&s;t proper to act with
<PB N="52" REF="52">publicity; the other, to extingui&s;h the &s;u&s;picions which the &s;trange conduct of Morris had occa&s;ioned in France.</P>
<P>When the Briti&s;h treaty, and the ratification of it by Mr. Wa&s;hington, was known in France, all fur|ther declarations from him of his good di&s;po&s;ition, as an ally and a friend, pa&s;&s;ed for &s;o many cyphers; but &s;till it appeared nece&s;&s;ary to him to keep up the farce of declarations. It is &s;tipulated in the Briti&s;h treaty, that commi&s;&s;ioners are to report at the end of two years on the ca&s;e of <HI>neutral &s;hips making neu|tral property.</HI> In the mean time neutral &s;hips do <HI>not</HI> make neutral property, according to the Briti&s;h treaty, and they do, according to the French treaty. The pre&s;ervation, therefore, of the French treaty became of great importance to England, as by that means &s;he can employ American &s;hips as carriers, whil&s;t the &s;ame advantage is denied to France. whether the French treaty could exi&s;t as a matter of right after this clande&s;tine perver&s;ion of it, could not but give &s;ome apprehen&s;ions to the partizans of the Briti&s;h treaty, and it became nece&s;&s;ary to them to make up, by fine words, what was wanting in good actions.</P>
<P>An opportunity offered to that purpo&s;e. The Convention, on the public reception of Mr. Mon|roe, ordered the American flag and the French flag to be di&s;played unitedly in the hall of the Conven|tion.
<PB N="53" REF="53">Mr. Monroe made a pre&s;ent of an American flag for the purpo&s;e. The Convention returned this compliment by &s;ending a French flag to Ame|rica, to be pre&s;ented by their mini&s;ter, Mr. Adet, to the American government. This re&s;olution pa&s;|&s;ed long before Jay's treaty was known or &s;u&s;pect|ed; it pa&s;&s;ed in the days of confidence; but the flag was not pre&s;ented by Mr. Adet till &s;eve|ral months after the treaty had been ratified. Mr. Wa&s;hington made this the occa&s;ion of &s;aying &s;ome &s;ine things to the French Mini&s;ter, and the better to get him&s;elf into tune to do this, he began by &s;aying the fine&s;t things of him&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q>Born, &s;ir (&s;aid he) in a land of liberty; <HI>having</HI> early learned its value; <HI>having</HI> engaged in a peri|lous conflict to defend it; <HI>having,</HI> in a word, de|voted the be&s;t years of my life to &s;ecure its per|manent e&s;tabli&s;hment in my own country; <HI>my</HI> anxious recollections, <HI>my</HI> &s;ympathetic feelings, and <HI>my</HI> be&s;t wi&s;hes are irre&s;i&s;tibly excited, when|ever, in any country, I &s;ee an oppre&s;&s;ed people unfurl the banners of freedom.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Wa&s;hington having expended &s;o many fine phra&s;es upon him&s;elf, was obliged to invent a new one for the French, and he calls them "wonder|ful people!" The coale&s;ced powers acknowledge as much.</P>
<P>It is laughable to hear Mr. Wa&s;hington talk of
<PB N="54" REF="54">his <HI>&s;ympathetic feelings,</HI> who has always been remark|ed, even among his friends, for not having any. He has, however, given no proof of any to me. As to the pompous encomiums he &s;o liberally pays to him&s;elf, on the &s;core of the American revolution, the reality of them may be que&s;tioned; and &s;ince he has forced them &s;o much into notice, it is fair to examine his preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>A &s;tranger might be led to &s;uppo&s;e from the egoti&s;m with which Mr. Wa&s;hington &s;peaks, that him&s;elf, and him&s;elf only, had generated, conduct|ed, compleated, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the revolution: In fine, that it was all his own doing.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, as to the political part, he had no &s;hare in it; and therefore the whole of <HI>that</HI> is out of the que&s;tion with re&s;pect to him. There remains then only the military part, and it would have been prudent in Mr. Wa&s;hington not to have awakened enquiry upon that &s;ubject. Fame then was cheap; he enjoyed it cheaply; and nobody was di&s;po&s;ed to take away the laurels, that, whether they were <HI>acquired</HI> or not, had been <HI>given.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Wa&s;hington's merit con&s;i&s;ted in con&s;tancy. But con&s;tancy was the common virtue of the revo|lution. Who was there that was incon&s;tant? I know of but one military defection, that of Arnold; and I know of no political defection, among tho&s;e who made them&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, when the revolu|tion
<PB N="55" REF="55">was formed by the declaration of independence. Even Silas Deane, though he attempted to defraud, did not betray.</P>
<P>But when we &s;peak of military character, &s;ome|thing more is to be under&s;tood than con&s;tancy; and &s;omething more <HI>ought</HI> to be under&s;tood than the Fabian &s;y&s;tem of <HI>doing nothing.</HI> The <HI>nothing</HI> part can be done by any body. Old Mrs. Thomp&s;on, the hou&s;e-keeper of head-quarters (who threatened to make the &s;un and the <HI>wind</HI> &s;hine through Riving-ton of New-York) could have done it as well as Mr. Wa&s;hington. Deborah would have been as good as Barak.</P>
<P>Mr. Wa&s;hington had the nominal rank of Com|mander in Chief; but he was not &s;o fact. He had in reality only a &s;eparate command. He had no controul over, or direction of, the army to the northward, under Gates, that captured Burgoyne; nor of that to the &s;outh, under Green, that recovered the &s;outhern States. The nominal rank, however, of Commander in chief, &s;erved to throw upon him the lu&s;tre of tho&s;e actions, and to make him appear as the &s;oul and centre of all the military operations in America.</P>
<P>He commenced his command June 1775, dur|ing the time the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts army lay before Bo&s;ton, and after the affair of Bunker-hill. The commencement of his command was the com|mencement
<PB N="56" REF="56">of inactivity. Nothing was afterwards done, or attempted to be done, during the nine months he remained before Bo&s;ton. If we may judge from the re&s;i&s;tance made at Concord and af|terwards at Bunker-hill, there was a &s;pirit of en|terpri&s;e at that time, which the pre&s;ence of Mr. Wa&s;hington chilled into cold defence. By the ad|vantage of a good exterior, he attracts re&s;pect, which his habitual &s;ilence tends to pre&s;erve; but he has not the talent of in&s;piring ardour in an army. The enemy removed from Bo&s;ton in March 1776, to wait for reinforcements from Europe, and to take a more advantageous po&s;ition at New York.</P>
<P>The inactivity of the campaign of 1775 on the part of General Wa&s;hington, when the enemy had a le&s;s force than in any future period of the war, and the injudicious choice of po&s;itions taken by him in the campaign of 1776, when the enemy had its greate&s;t force, nece&s;&s;arily produced the lo&s;&s;es and misfortunes that marked that gloomy campaign. The po&s;itions taken were either i&s;lands or necks of land. In the former, the enemy, by the aid of their &s;hips could bring their whole force again&s;t a part of Gen. Wa&s;hington's, as in the affair of Long-I&s;land, and in the latter he might be &s;hut up as in the bottom of a bag. This had nearly been the ca&s;e at New York, and it was &s;o in part; it was actu|ally the ca&s;e at Fort Wa&s;hington; and would have
<PB N="57" REF="57">been the ca&s;e at Fort Lee if Gen. Greene had not moved precipitately off, leaving every thing behind, and by gaining Hackin&s;ach bridge, got out of the bag of Bergen neck. How far Mr. Wa&s;hington, as a General, is blameable for the&s;e matters, I am not undertaking to determine, but they are evidently defects in military geography. The &s;ucce&s;sful &s;kir|mi&s;hes at the clo&s;e of that campaign (matters that would &s;carcely be noticed in a better &s;tate of things) make the brilliant exploits of Gen. Wa&s;hington's &s;even campaigns.&mdash;No wonder we &s;ee &s;o much pu|&s;illanimity in the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> when we &s;ee &s;o little en|terpri&s;e in the <HI>General.</HI></P>
<P>The campaign of 1777 became famous, not by any thing on the part of Gen. Wa&s;hington, but by the capture of Gen. Burgoyne and the army under his command, by the Northern army at Saratoga under Gen. Gates. So totally di&s;tinct and uncon|nected were the two armies of Wa&s;hington and Gates, and &s;o independent was the latter of the authority of the nominal Commander in Chief, that the two Generals did not &s;o much as corre&s;pond, and it was only by a letter of Gen. (&s;ince Gover|nor) Clinton, that General Wa&s;hington was inform|ed of that event. The Briti&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Philadelphia this year, which they evacuated the next, ju&s;t time enough to &s;ave their heavy baggage and &s;leet of tran&s;ports from capture by the French
<PB N="58" REF="58">Admiral d'E&s;taing, who arrived at the mouth of the Delaware &s;oon after.</P>
<P>The capture of Burgoyne gave an eclat in Europe to the American arms, and facilitated the alliance with France. The eclat, however, was not kept up by any thing on the part of Gen. Wa&s;hington. The &s;ame unfortunate langour that marked his en|trance into the field continued always. Di&s;contents began to prevail &s;trongly again&s;t him, and a party was formed in Congre&s;s, whil&s;t &s;itting at York-Town, in Penn&s;ylvania, for removing him from the command of the army. The hope, however, of better times, the news of the alliance with France, and the unwillingne&s;s of &s;hewing di&s;content, di&s;&s;i|pated the matter.</P>
<P>Nothing was done in the campaigns of 1778, 1779, 1780, in the part where Gen. Wa&s;hington commanded, except the taking Stony Point by Gen. Wayne. The Southern States in the mean time were over-run by the enemy. They were af|terwards recovered by Gen. Greene, who had in a very great mea&s;ure created the army that accom|pli&s;hed that recovery. In all this Gen. Wa&s;hing|ton had not &s;hare. The Fabian &s;y&s;tem of war, fol|lowed by him, began now to unfold it&s;elf with all its evils, for what is Fabian war without Fabian means to &s;upport it.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="59">The finances of congre&s;s, depending wholly on emi&s;&s;ions of paper money, were exhau&s;ted. Its credit was gone. The continental trea&s;ury was not able to pay the expence of a brigade of waggons to tran&s;port the nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores to the army, and yet the &s;ole object, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the revolu|tion, was a thing of remote di&s;tance. The time I am now &s;peaking of is the latter end of the year 1780.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of things it was found not only expedient but ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for Congre&s;s to &s;tate the whole ca&s;e to its ally. I knew more of this matter (before it came into Congre&s;s or was known to General Wa&s;hington) of its progre&s;s, and its i&s;&s;ue, than I chu&s;e to &s;tate in this letter. Col. John Laurens was &s;ent to France as Envoy Ex|traordinary on this occa&s;ion, and by a private agree|ment between him and me I accompanied him. We &s;ailed from Bo&s;ton in the Alliance frigate, Feb. 11th, 1781. France had already done much in accepting and paying bills drawn by Congre&s;s. She was now called upon to do more. The event of Col. Laurens's mi&s;&s;ion, with the aid of the ve|nerable mini&s;ter, Franklin, was, that France gave in money, as a pre&s;ent, &s;ix millions of livres, and ten millions more as a loan, and agreed to &s;end a fleet of not le&s;s than thirty &s;ail of the line, at her own expence, as an aid to America. Col. Laurens
<PB N="60" REF="60">and my&s;elf returned from Bre&s;t the 1&s;t of June following, taking with us two millions and an half of livres (upwards of one hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling) of the money given, and convoying two &s;hips with &s;tores.</P>
<P>We arrived at Bo&s;ton the 25th Augu&s;t following. De Gra&s;&s;e arrived with the French fleet in the Che&s;apeak at the &s;ame time, and was afterwards joined by that of Barras, making 31 &s;ail of the line. The money was tran&s;ported in waggons from Bo&s;|ton to the Bank at Philadelphia, of which Mr. Thomas Willing, who has &s;ince put him&s;elf at the head of the li&s;t of petitioners in favour of the Briti&s;h treaty, was then Pre&s;ident, and it was by the aid of this money, and of this fleet, and of Rocham|beau's army, that Cornwallis was taken; the law|rels of which have been unju&s;tly given to Mr. Wa&s;h|ington. His merit in that affair was no more than that of any other American officer.</P>
<P>I have had, and &s;till have, as much pride in the American revolution as any man, or as Mr. Wa&s;h|ington has a right to have; but that pride has never made me forgetful from whence the great aid came that compleated the bu&s;ine&s;s. Foreign aid (that of France) was calculated upon at the com|mencement of the revolution. It is one of the &s;ub|jects treated of in the pamphlet <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> but
<PB N="61" REF="61">as a matter that could not be hoped for, unle&s;s In|dependence was declared.</P>
<P>It is as well the ingratitude as the pu&s;illanimity of Mr. Wa&s;hington and the Wa&s;hington faction, that has brought upon America the lo&s;s of character &s;he now &s;uffers in the world, and the numerous evils her commerce has undergone, and to which it is yet expo&s;ed. The Briti&s;h mini&s;try &s;oon found out what &s;ort of men they had to deal with, and they dealt with them accordingly; and if further explanation was wanting, it has been fully given &s;ince in the &s;nivelling addre&s;s of the New-York Chamber of Commerce to the Pre&s;ident, and in that of &s;undry merchants of Philadelphia, which was not much better.</P>
<P>When the revolution of America was finally e&s;|tabli&s;hed by the termination of the war, the world gave her credit for great character; and &s;he had nothing to do but to &s;tand firm upon that ground. The Briti&s;h mini&s;try had their hands too full of trouble to have provoked unnece&s;&s;arily a rupture with her, had &s;he &s;hewn a proper re&s;olution to de|fend her rights. But encouraged as they were by the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive character of her executive admini&s;|tration, they proceeded from in&s;ult to in&s;ult till none more were left to be offered. The propo&s;als made by Sweden and Denmark to the American
<PB N="62" REF="62">admini&s;tration were di&s;regarded. I know not if &s;o much as an an&s;wer has been returned to them. The mini&s;ter <HI>penitentiary</HI> (as &s;ome of the Briti&s;h prints called him) Mr. Jay, was &s;ent on a pilgri|mage to London, to make all up by penance and petition. In the mean time the lengthy and drow|&s;y writer of the pieces &s;igned <HI>Camillus</HI> held him&s;elf in re&s;erve to vindicate every thing; and to &s;ound, in America, the toc&s;in of terror upon the inexhau&s;tible re&s;ources of England. Her re&s;ources, &s;ays he, are greater than tho&s;e of all the other powers. This man is &s;o intoxicated with fear and finance that he knows not the difference between <HI>plus</HI> and <HI>minus</HI>&mdash;between an hundred pounds in hand, and an hun|dred pounds wor&s;e than nothing.</P>
<P>The commerce of America, &s;o far as it had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by all the treaties that had been formed prior to that by Jay, was free, and the principles upon which it was e&s;tabli&s;hed were good. That ground ought never to have been departed from. It was the ju&s;tifiable ground of right, and no tem|porary difficulties ought to have induced an aban|donment of it. The ca&s;e now is otherwi&s;e. The ground, the &s;cene, the preten&s;ions, the every thing, are changed. The commerce of America is, by Jay's treaty, put under foreign dominion. The &s;ea is not free for her. Her right to navigate it is re|duced
<PB N="63" REF="63">to the right of e&s;caping; that is, until &s;ome &s;hip of England or France, &s;tops her ve&s;&s;els and carries them into port. Every article of American produce, whether from the &s;ea or the land, fi&s;h, fle&s;h, vegetable, or manufacture, is, by Jay's trea|ty, made either contraband or &s;eizable. Nothing is exempt. In all other treaties of commerce the ar|ticle which enumerates the contraband articles, &s;uch as fire arms, gun powder, &amp;c. is followed by ano|ther article which enumerates the articles not con|traband: but it is not &s;o in Jay's treaty. There is no exempting article. Its place is &s;upplied by the article for &s;eizing and carrying into port; and the &s;weeping phra&s;e of "provi&s;ions and <HI>other articles,</HI>" includes every thing. There never was &s;uch a ba&s;e and &s;ervile treaty of &s;urrender &s;ince treaties began to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>This is the ground upon which America now &s;tands. All her rights of commerce and navigation have to commence anew, and that with lo&s;s of character to begin with. If there is &s;en&s;e enough left in the heart to call a blu&s;h into the cheek, the Wa&s;hington admini&s;tration mu&s;t be a&s;hamed to ap|pear.&mdash;And as to you, &s;ir, treacherous in pri|vate friend&s;hip (for &s;o you have been to me, and that in the day of danger) and a hypocrite in pub|lic life, the world will be puzzled to decide, whe|ther
<PB N="64" REF="64">you are an apo&s;tate or an impo&s;tor; whether you have abandoned good principles, or whether you ever had any?</P>

<BYLINE>BY THOMAS PAINE.</BYLINE>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">N. B. The letter of Mr. Monroe, on page 20 is an an&s;wer to this Memorial.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Pri&s;on of the Luxembourg,</HI> <DATE><HI>Sept. 10th,</HI> 1796.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Addre&s;s this Memorial to you in con&s;equence of a letter I received from a friend, 18 Fructidor, (Sept. 4th) in which he &s;ays: <Q>Mr. Monroe has told me that he has no orders (meaning from the American government) re&s;pecting you, but I am &s;ure he will leave nothing undone to libcrate you; but, from what I learn from all the late Ameri|cans, you are not con&s;idered, either by the gov|ernment or by the individuals, as an American ci|tizen. You have been made a French citizen, which you have accepted, and you have further made your&s;elf a &s;ervant of the French Republic, and it would be out of character for an Ameri|can mini&s;ter to interfere in their internal con|cerns.
<PB N="66" REF="66">You mu&s;t, therefore, either be liberated out of compliment to America, or &s;tand your trial, which you have a right to demand.</Q></P>
<P>This information was &s;o unexpected by me, that I am at a lo&s;s how to an&s;wer it. I know not on what principle it originates; whether from an idea that I had voluntarily abandoned my citizen&s;hip of America for that of France, or from any article in the American con&s;titution applied to me. The fir&s;t is untrue with re&s;pect to any intention on my part; and the &s;econd is without foundation, as I &s;hall &s;hew in the cour&s;e of this memorial.</P>
<P>The idea of conferring the honor of citizen&s;hip upon foreigners who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in propagating the principles of liberty and humanity, in oppo&s;ition to de&s;poti&s;m, war and blood&s;hed, was fir&s;t propo&s;ed by me to La Fayette, at the com|mencement of the French revolution, when his heart appeared to be warmed with tho&s;e principles. My motive in making this propo&s;al was to render the people of different nations more fraternal than they had been or then were. I ob&s;erved that almo&s;t every branch of &s;cience had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it&s;elf of the ex|erci&s;e of this right, &s;o far as regarded its own in|&s;titution. Mo&s;t of the academies and &s;ocieties in Europe conferred the rank of honorary member upon foreigners eminent in knowlege, and made them members of their literary or &s;cientific republic,
<PB N="67" REF="67">without affecting or any ways dimini&s;hing their rights of citizen&s;hip in their own country, or in other &s;ocieties; and why the &s;cience of govern|ment &s;hould not have the &s;ame advantage, or why the people of one nation &s;hould not, by their repre|&s;entatives, exerci&s;e the right of conferring the honor of citizen&s;hip upon individuals eminent in another nation, without affecting <HI>their</HI> rights of citizen&s;hip in their proper country, is a problem yet to be &s;olved.</P>
<P>I now proceed to remark on that part of the let|ter in which the writer &s;ays, that <Q>from all be can learn from the late Americans, I am not con&s;i|dered, in America, either by the government or by the individuals, as an American citizen.</Q></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place I wi&s;h to a&s;k, what is here meant by the government of America? The mem|bers who compo&s;e the government are only indivi|duals when in conver&s;ation, and who mu&s;t proba|bly hold very different opinions upon the &s;ubject. Have Congre&s;s as a body made any declaration re|&s;pecting me, that they no longer con&s;ider me as a citizen? If they have not, any thing they may other|wi&s;e &s;ay is no more than the opinion of individuals, and con&s;equently is not legal authority, nor any wi&s;e authority to deprive any man of his citizen|&s;hip. Be&s;ides, whether a man has forfeited his rights of citizen&s;hip is a que&s;tion not determinable
<PB N="68" REF="68">by Congre&s;s, but by a Court of Judicature and a Jury, and mu&s;t depend upon evidence and the ap|plication of &s;ome law or article of the con&s;titution to the ca&s;e. No &s;uch proceeding has yet been had, and con&s;equently I remain a citizen until it be had, be that determination what it may; for there can be no &s;uch thing as a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of rights in he in|terim.</P>
<P>I am aware of the article of the con&s;titution which &s;ays, as nearly as I can recollect, that any citizen of the United States who &s;hall accept any title, place, or office, from any foreign king, prince or &s;tate, &s;hall forfeit and lo&s;e his right of citizen|&s;hip of the United States.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Even this article does act exi&s;t in the manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere stated.</NOTE></P>
<P>Had the article &s;aid that <HI>any citizen of the United States, who &s;hall be member of any foreign convention for the purpo&s;e of forming a free con&s;titution, &s;hall forfeit and lo&s;e the right of citizen&s;hip of the United States,</HI> he article had been directly applicable to me; but the idea of &s;uch an article never could have enter|ed the mind of the American Convention, and the pre&s;ent article is altogether foreign to the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to me; for it &s;uppo&s;es a government in ac|tual exi&s;tence, and not a government di&s;&s;olved; and it &s;uppo&s;es a citizen of America accepting titles
<PB N="69" REF="69">and offices under that government, and not a citi|zen of America who gives his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in a Con|vention cho&s;en by the people for the purpose of forming a government <HI>de novo,</HI> founded on their authority.</P>
<P>The late con&s;titution and government of France was di&s;&s;olved the 10th of Augu&s;t, 1972. The National Legi&s;lative A&s;&s;embly then in being, &s;uppo&s;|ed it&s;elf without authority to continue its &s;ittings, and it propo&s;ed to the departments to elect, not another Legi&s;lative Body, but a Convention for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of forming a con&s;titution. When the A&s;&s;embly were di&s;cour&s;ing on this matter, &s;ome of the members &s;aid, that they wi&s;hed to gain all the information po&s;&s;ible upon the &s;ubject of free con&s;titutions, and expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to invite foreign|ers of any nation to the Convention, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in defending, explaining, and propagating the principles of Liberty. It was on this occa&s;ion that my name was mentioned in the A&s;&s;embly. I was then in England. After this a deputation from a body of the French people, in order to remove any objection that might be made again&s;t my a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the propo&s;ed Convention, re|que&s;ted the A&s;&s;embly, as their repre&s;entatives, to confer on me the title of French Citizen; after which I was elected in four different departments, as is already known.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="70">The ca&s;e therefore is, that I accepted nothing from any king, prince, or &s;tate, nor from any gov|ernment; for France was then without any gov|ernment, except what aro&s;e from nece&s;&s;ity and con&s;ent. Neither did I <HI>made my&s;elf a &s;ervant of the French Republic,</HI> as the letter already alluded to ex|pre&s;&s;es; for France at that time was not a Repub|lic, not even in name. She was altogether a peo|ple in a &s;tate of revolution.</P>
<P>It was not until the Convention met, that France was declared a Republic and monarchy a|boli&s;hed; &s;oon after which a committee was elect|ed, of which I was cho&s;en a member, to form a con&s;titution, which was pre&s;ented to the Conven|tion and read by Condorcet (who was al&s;o a mem|ber) the 15th and 16th of February following; but was not to be taken into con&s;ideration till after the expiration of two months. The di&s;orders and the revolutionary government that took place after this put a &s;top to any further progre&s;s upon the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>In thus employing my&s;elf upon the formation of a con&s;titution, I certainly did nothing incon&s;i&s;tent with the American con&s;titution. I took no oath of allegiance to France, nor any other oath whatever. I con&s;idered the citizen&s;hip they had pre&s;ented me with, as an honorary mark of re&s;pect paid to me, not only as a friend of liberty, but as an American
<PB N="71" REF="71">citizen. My acceptance of that, or of the deputy|&s;hip, not conferred on me by any king, prince, or &s;tate, but by a people in a &s;tate of revolution and contending for liberty, required no transfer of my allegiance or of my citizen&s;hip from America to France. In America I was a real citizen, paying taxes annually; in France I was a volunteer friend, employing my&s;elf on a temporary &s;ervice. Every American in Paris knew that it was my con&s;tant intention to return to America, as &s;oon as a con|&s;titution &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed in France, and that I anxiou&s;ly waited for that event.</P>
<P>I ever mu&s;t deny that any article of the American con&s;titution can be applied either literally, intention|ally, or con&s;tructively again&s;t me. It undoubtedly was the intention of the convention that framed the con&s;titution, to pre&s;erve the purity of the American Republic from being deba&s;ed by foreign and foppi&s;h cu&s;toms; but it could never be its intentions to act again&s;t the principles of liberty, by forbidding its ci|tizens to a&s;&s;i&s;t in promoting tho&s;e principles in foreign countries. Neither could it be its intention to act again&s;t the principles of gratitude: France had aided America in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her revolution, when invaded and oppre&s;&s;ed by England and her auxilaries. France, in her turn, was invaded and oppre&s;&s;ed by a combination of foreign de&s;pots. In this &s;i|tuation I conceived it an act of gratitude in me, as
<PB N="72" REF="72">a citizen of America, to render her in return the be&s;t &s;ervices I could perform. I came to France (for I was in England when I was elected) not to enjoy ea&s;e, emoluments, or foppi&s;h honours, as the article &s;uppo&s;es; but to encounter difficulties and dangers in defence of liberty; and I much que&s;tion whether tho&s;e who now malignantly &s;eek to turn this to my injury (for &s;ome I believe do) would have had courage to have done the &s;ame thing. I am &s;ure Gouv. Morris would not. He told me the &s;econd day after my arrival in Paris, that the Au&s;trians and Pru&s;&s;ians, who were then at Verdun, would be in Paris in a fortnight. I have no idea, &s;aid he, that &s;eventy thou&s;and di&s;ciplined troops can be &s;topt in their march by any power in France.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the rea&s;ons I have already given for ac|cepting the invitation to the Convention, I had a|nother that has reference particularly to America, and which I mentioned to Mr. &mdash; the night before I left London to come to Paris; <HI>that it was to the intere&s;t of America, that the &s;y&s;tem of European go|vernments &s;hould be changed, and placed on the &s;ame prin|ciple with her own.</HI></P>
<P>It is certain that governments upon &s;imilar princi|ples agree better together, than tho&s;e that are found|ed on principles di&s;cordant with each other; and the &s;ame rule holds good with re&s;pect to the people living under them. In the latter ca&s;e they offend each
<PB N="73" REF="73">other by pity or by reproach, and the di&s;cordancy carries it&s;elf into matters of commerce. I am not an ambitious man, but perhaps I have been an am|bitious American. <HI>I have wi&s;hed to &s;ee America the mother church of government.</HI></P>
<P>I have now &s;tated &s;ufficient matter to &s;hew, that the article in the con&s;titution is not applicable to me, and that any &s;uch application of it to my inju|ry, as well in circum&s;tances as in rights, is illegal and uncon&s;titutional. Neither do I believe that any jury in America, when they are informed of the whole of the ca&s;e, would give a verdict to deprive me of my right upon that article. The citizens of America, I believe, are not very fond of permitting forced and indirect explanations to be put upon matters of this kind. I know not what were the merits of the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the per&s;on who was pro&s;ecuted for acting as prize-ma&s;ter to a French prize, but I know that the jury gave a verdict a|gain&s;t the pro&s;ecution; the rights I have acquired are dear to me; they have been acquired by honor|able means, and by dangerous &s;ervice in the wor&s;t of times, and I cannot permit them to be wre&s;ted from me. I conceive it my duty to defend them, as the ca&s;e involves a con&s;titutional and public que&s;tion, which is, how far the power of the fe|deral government (it &s;hould have been &s;aid in this
<PB N="74" REF="74">place the executive) extends in depriving any citizen of his rights of citizen&s;hip, or of &s;u&s;pending them.</P>
<P>That the explanation of national treaties belongs to Congre&s;s, is &s;trictly con&s;titutional; but not the explanation of the con&s;titution it&s;elf, upon a legal ca&s;e, any more than the explaination of law in the ca&s;e of individual citizens. The&s;e are altogether judiciary que&s;tions. It is, however, worth ob&s;erv|ing, that Congre&s;s in explaining the article of the treaty with re&s;pect to French prizes and French privateers, confined it&s;elf &s;trictly to the letter of the article. Let them explain the article of the con&s;titution with re&s;pect to me in the &s;ame man|ner, and that deci&s;ion, did it appertain to them, could not deprive me of my rights of citizen&s;hip or &s;u&s;pend them, for I have accepted nothing from any king, prince, &s;tate, or government.</P>
<P>Painful as the want of liberty may be, it is a con&s;olation to believe, that my impri&s;onment proves to the world that I had no &s;hare in the murderous &s;y&s;tem that raged during the reign of terror. That I was an enemy to it both morally and politically, is known to all that had any knowledge of me; and could I have written French as well as I can Engli&s;h, I would have publicly expo&s;ed its wicked|ne&s;s and &s;hewn the ruin with which it was preg|nant. Tho&s;e who have e&s;teemed me on former occa&s;ions, whether in America or in Europe will, I
<PB N="75" REF="75">know, feel no cau&s;e to abate that e&s;teem, when they reflect, <HI>that impri&s;onment with pre&s;ervation of character is preferable to liberty with di&s;grace.</HI></P>
<P>The letter quoted in the fir&s;t page of this memo|rial &s;ays, that <Q>it would be out of character for an American mini&s;ter to interfere in the internal affairs of France.</Q> This goes on the idea that I am a citizen of France, and a member of the Con|vention, which is not the fact. The Convention included me in the vote for di&s;mi&s;&s;ing foreigners from the Convention, and the Committees impri|&s;oned me as a foreigner. It al&s;o &s;uppo&s;es decided|ly, that the article in the American con&s;titution re&s;pecting grants made to American citizens by foreign kings, princes, or &s;tates, is applicable to me; which is the very point in que&s;tion, and a|gain&s;t the application of which I contend. I &s;tate evidence to the mini&s;ter to &s;hew, that I am not within the letter or meaning of that article; that it cannot operate again&s;t me; and I apply to him for the protection that I conceive I have a right to a&s;k and to receive. The internal affairs of France are out of the que&s;tion with re&s;pect to my applica|tion, or his interference. I a&s;k it not as a citizen of France, for I am not one; I a&s;k it not as a member of the Convention, for I am not one; I a&s;k it not as a man, again&s;t wham there is any as cu&s;ation, for there is none; I a&s;k it not as an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="76" REF="76">from America, who&s;e liberties I have honorably and generou&s;ly contributed to defend and e&s;tabli&s;h; I a&s;k it as a citizen of America, deprived of his li|berty in France under the plea of his being a for|eigner; and I a&s;k it, becau&s;e I conceive I am enti|tled to it, upon every principle of con&s;titutional ju&s;|tice and national honor.</P>
