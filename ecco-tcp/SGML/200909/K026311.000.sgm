<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>I. <HI>Of Faith;</HI></HI> Or what a Chri&s;tian &s;hould BELIEVE.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P><HI>Question.</HI> You are required, you &s;ee, both to <HI>believe</HI> and <HI>live</HI> as a chri&s;tian ought to do; what are you then required fir&s;t to <HI>believe?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> I mu&s;t believe in God&mdash;that he is a Being of <HI>infinite ju&s;tice, power, wi&s;|dom,</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> When you &s;ay you believe God is a Being of <HI>infinite ju&s;tice,</HI> what do you mean?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I mean, that God is ju&s;t to all his crea|tures; and particularly that he will reward and puni&s;h us in the next world, according to our behaviour in this.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="8"><HI>Q.</HI> What do you mean when you &s;ay he is a Being of <HI>infinite power?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I mean, that God can do every thing; and that every thing, that is done, is done by him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But why do you believe that; when you know many things are done by men?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e it is through God, that men are enabled to do any thing. Be&s;ides, God makes the &s;tone, the iron, the wood, and all other things, which men u&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do you mean, when you &s;ay God is a Being of <HI>infinite wi&s;dom?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I mean, that God knows every thing; and particularly what is be&s;t for us all.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> And when you &s;ay, God is a Being of <HI>infinite goodne&s;s,</HI> what do you mean?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I mean, that his goodne&s;s is unbounded, and that all the good we receive of every kind, comes from him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But you receive good &s;ometimes from men?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes&punc; but God enables them to do it, by putting it into their hearts&mdash;by affording them opportunities&mdash;and by giving them the means. So that all the good men do, may properly be &s;aid to come from God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> You &s;ay farther you believe that God <HI>created</HI> and <HI>pre&s;erves</HI> every thing; why do you believe that God created every thing?</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="9"><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e I &s;ee every where the <HI>marks of de&s;ign,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do do you mean by the <HI>marks of de&s;ign?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I mean that when <HI>one part an&s;wers to another</HI> in any thing, and an <HI>end is produced,</HI> there are the <HI>marks of de&s;ign,</HI> or contrivance, in that thing.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But you &s;ee the&s;e <HI>marks of de&s;ign</HI> and contrivance in the works of men&mdash;you &s;ee in a hou&s;e, for in&s;tance, the roof, the door, the windows, and all the other parts <HI>related</HI> to each other&mdash;and an <HI>end produced</HI> by its affording a convenient &s;helter from the wea|ther: but you do not believe in God, becau&s;e you &s;ee the <HI>marks of de&s;ign</HI> in a hou&s;e?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: but as the <HI>marks of de&s;ign</HI> in a hou&s;e &s;hew me that it has been made by the &s;kill, and contrivance of men, and not by chance; &s;o when I &s;ee &s;uperior <HI>marks of de|&s;ign</HI> in things which men cannot make&mdash;as in the &s;un&mdash;in plants&mdash;in bea&s;ts&mdash;in birds&mdash;in fi&s;hes&mdash;and numberle&s;s other things, I con|clude they are created by God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Tell me then what <HI>relation</HI> there is be|tween the &s;un and the earth, for in&s;tance, and what <HI>ends are produced</HI> by it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The &s;un draws vapours, or particles of water, both from the &s;ea and land, ju&s;t in the &s;ame way as particles of water are formed by
<PB N="4" REF="10">
heat on the lid of a boiling pot. The&s;e vapours, which the &s;un draws up, become clouds; and are driven about by winds to different parts of the earth; and when they fall in rain, the <HI>end they produce,</HI> is food for man and bea&s;t.&mdash;The &s;un al&s;o gives light to the earth; and warms it, &s;o as to make it fruitful.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How do you ob&s;erve this <HI>relation of parts,</HI> and <HI>end produced,</HI> in plants?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The root is <HI>related</HI> to the earth, and draws nouri&s;hment from it&mdash;the &s;tem is <HI>re|lated</HI> to the root, and carries that nouri&s;hment up to the flower; from which the <HI>end pro|duced</HI> is the &s;eed, or fruit.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What marks of <HI>de&s;ign</HI> do you &s;ee in animals?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are all <HI>fitted to their &s;everal &s;ta|tions:</HI> and the <HI>end produced</HI> is to fill every part of the world with living creatures; all of which have their u&s;e, tho we cannot find out the u&s;e of all.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How is the bird fitted for its &s;tation?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It has wings to fly with&mdash;it is made light&mdash;and &s;harp-pointed, &s;o as to pa&s;s ea&s;ily through the air.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How is the fi&s;h fitted for its &s;tation?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It has fins to &s;wim with; and when it wants to go to the top of the water, or to the bottom, it has a little bladder, which it can
<PB N="5" REF="11">
fill with air, and empty, as it chu&s;es. When the bladder is filled, the fi&s;h is lighter than the water, and ri&s;es to the top: when the bladder is emptied, the fi&s;h is heavier, and &s;inks to the bottom.&mdash;Some fi&s;h keep con|&s;tantly at the bottom, becau&s;e they find their food there.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How is the mole fitted for its way of life?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It has &s;hort broad feet, with which it &s;crapes away the earth: and as it has no bu&s;ine&s;s out of the ground, its eyes are very &s;mall, and ju&s;t &s;erve to &s;hew it that it has lo&s;t its way when it gets into the light.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Thus then, in the &s;ame manner, every creature is fitted for the &s;tation it lives in; which &s;hews they are all created by an Al|mighty power, and not by chance.&mdash;But you &s;ay you believe God <HI>pre&s;erves</HI> the world, as well as created it; what do you mean by God's <HI>pre&s;erving</HI> the world?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I mean that he keeps it in the &s;ame order, in which he at fir&s;t created it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why do you believe that?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e if God did not keep it in or|der, it would fall to decay; ju&s;t as a hou&s;e would fall to decay, if it were not kept in order. It is through a belief that God pre|&s;erves the world, that all the affairs of life are carried on. We eat, and drink, becau&s;e we
<PB N="6" REF="12">
believe the life of man will be nouri&s;hed by food, as it always has been. We plant trees&punc; and &s;ow corn, becau&s;e we believe they will grow as they have ever done, for our u&s;e, and &s;u&s;tenance. If God did not pre&s;erve the world in its regular order, corn might pro|duce weeds.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> You &s;ay, you believe farther, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God is <HI>pre&s;ent every where.</HI> But how doe that differ from your being pre&s;ent every where? You can be in this place, and in tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> place, and in many different places?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I can only be in one place at one time but God is in all places at the <HI>&s;ame in&s;tant o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why do you believe that?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It follows from God's pre&s;erving th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> world. As he pre&s;erves every part of it at once he mu&s;t be pre&s;ent in every part at once.&mdash;Be|&s;ides, if God was not in all places at once, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would order the people of one country to pray to him at one time, and the people o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> another country to pray to him at another But as they may pray to him all at once, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> plain he can hear them all at once.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> You next &s;ay, you believe the <HI>holy &s;criptures to be the word of God.</HI> What do you mean by the holy &s;criptures?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Bible and Te&s;tament.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why are they called the word of God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e holy men wrote them by God's order.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do you mean when you &s;ay, they contain <HI>all things nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I mean, that they contain all things nece&s;|&s;ary for us to know, and do, in order to gain God's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avour, and everla&s;ting happine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But there are many difficulties in the &s;criptures, both in the old and new Te&s;ta|ment; and many things which we do not un|der&s;tand; how then can they be of u&s;e to us?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> There is enough in them which we do under&s;tand, that is &s;ufficient to lead us right.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But why &s;hould there be any difficulties in books meant to be of &s;uch u&s;e to us?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the old Te&s;tament many difficulties ari&s;e from our not con&s;idering, that God acted
<PB N="8" REF="14">
in a different manner in the early ages of the world, and particularly towards the Jews, from that, in which he acts now.&mdash;Be&s;ides, we make difficulties our&s;elves by &s;uppo&s;ing, that many actions are allowable, becau&s;e they are done by good men. Whereas, in fact, many of the&s;e actions were never intended for our imitation. Some of them were bad in them|&s;elves; and many things, tho allowed under the law of Mo&s;es, are not permitted by the go&s;pel.&mdash; La&s;tly, as the Bible is the olde&s;t book, that ever was written, it may be &s;up|po&s;ed, that many things may have become ob&s;cure, and difficult through length of time.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But we find difficulties al&s;o in the new Te&s;tament?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is generally &s;uppo&s;ed there are much fewer, than might have been expected from its ancient date; and from the Jewi&s;h ways of &s;peaking, and Jewi&s;h cu&s;toms, which we find in it, and which are &s;o different from ours.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Give me an in&s;tance of &s;ome <HI>way of &s;peaking</HI> among the Jews, that is different from ours.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Our Saviour &s;ays, <HI>He that hateth not his father, and mother, cannot be my di&s;ciple:</HI> but he means only, that we &s;hould love God bet|ter than we do our fathers and mothers&mdash;and the Jews under&s;tood it in that &s;en&s;e.&mdash;
<PB N="9" REF="15">
Again, where it is &s;aid <HI>Jacob have I loved, and E&s;au have I hated;</HI> nothing is meant but that God intended to rai&s;e the Jewi&s;h nation from Jacob.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What in&s;tances can you give me of difficulties ari&s;ing from <HI>Jewi&s;h cu&s;toms?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We are told that a man was let down through the tiling of a hou&s;e before Je&s;us. This would be difficult in our hou&s;es; but was very ea&s;y in a Jewi&s;h hou&s;e, which was often only one &s;tory high&mdash;had a flat roof&mdash; and &s;ometimes a trap door through the roof, into the chamber below; with &s;tairs on the out&s;ide. So that nothing was ea&s;ier, than to carry the man to the top of the hou&s;e, and let him down through the roof.&mdash;To &s;uch hou&s;es our Saviour alludes, when he &s;ays, <HI>He that is on the hou&s;e-top, let him not come down into the hou&s;e.</HI> And, <HI>What ye hear in the ear, that preach ye from the hou&s;e-top;</HI> which was the mo&s;t convenient way of &s;peaking to the people; becau&s;e the windows were high, and latticed.&mdash;When we are told al&s;o, that <HI>new wine will bur&s;t old bottles,</HI> it is ea&s;y to con|ceive it, when we know that the Jewi&s;h bottles were made of leather.&mdash;Again, we read in the &s;tory of the good Samaritan, that he <HI>pulled out two-pence and gave it to the ho&s;t;</HI> which appears to us a very trifling &s;um. But the penny that pa&s;&s;ed in Judea, was &s;ome|what
<PB N="10" REF="16">
more than &s;even pence of our money; &s;o that two-pence was as much as fifteen or &s;ixteen pence with us; and as things were cheaper in Judea than they are here, fifteen or &s;ixteen pence would buy as much as four or five &s;hillings could buy now.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But &s;till the &s;cripture may be fal&s;e; what rea&s;on have you for believing it is true?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e there were people alive, when it was written, who could remember the mira|cles, and other things mentioned; and could compare the things done, with the things that were written: and if it had been found to mention things that had never been done, it would not have been &s;uffered to come down to us as true.&mdash;Learned men al&s;o can even trace up the new Te&s;tament from its being mentioned in different books, to the very time, when it was written.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> As you believe the &s;cripture therefore to be true, you believe next in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;on of God&mdash;and in the hi&s;tory of him, as contained in the new Te&s;tament; let me hear you repeat the hi&s;tory of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as it is drawn up in the Creed.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="17"><HI>A.</HI> I believe, that he was born of the Vir|gin Mary&mdash;&s;uffered under Pontius Pilate&mdash; was crucified&mdash;dead&mdash;and buried&mdash;he de|&s;cended into hell&mdash;the third day he ro&s;e again from the dead&mdash;he a&s;cended into heaven; and &s;itteth on the right hand of God, the father Almighty; from whence he &s;hall come to judge the quick and the dead.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do you mean by Chri&s;t's <HI>de|&s;cending into hell?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Only that his &s;oul and body were &s;epa|rated&mdash;that is, that he <HI>really died. Hell</HI> means only the <HI>grave.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the great article that you be|lieve, with regard to Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That he &s;uffered death for the &s;ins of mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But how came mankind to want a Sa|viour to &s;uffer death for their &s;ins?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e, on Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, all his po&s;terity became corrupt, and &s;ubject to God's di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> In what did Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion con&s;i&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In eating the forbidden fruit.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But does it not appear very hard that God Almighty &s;hould puni&s;h Adam &s;o much merely for eating an apple; or whatever the forbidden fruit was?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The &s;in did not con&s;i&s;t in eating the fruit, but in di&s;obeying God. God placed

Adam in a &s;tate of trial, as he places us; but as it was before the world had any people in it, his trial mu&s;t have been in &s;ome very ea&s;y thing. He could not be guilty of theft, or envy, or covetou&s;ne&s;s, or bearing fal&s;e wit|ne&s;s, or almo&s;t any of the crimes, which are now forbidden, becau&s;e there were then no inhabitants in the world. Nor could he prac|tice many of the duties, which men now prac|tice. He could not be charitable, nor forgive injuries; nor honour his father and mother. And as he lived in a garden, nothing could be more natural, than to put his obedience to the te&s;t of refraining from a certain tree.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But does it not &s;eem hard that Adam's po&s;terity &s;hould &s;uffer through his fault?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It does not appear that he had any po&s;terity at the time of the fall; &s;o that his children could not properly be &s;aid to lo&s;e what they never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> As Chri&s;t redeemed us then from the mi&s;chiefs of the fall of Adam, let me know, in what way his &s;ufferings atoned for the &s;ins of mankind?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible for any body to an&s;wer that que&s;tion: but as I believe the &s;cripture to be true, I believe in the atonement of Chri&s;t, which is the plain doctrine of &s;crip|ture, tho I do not under&s;tand it. I believe the fact, tho I cannot explain it.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="19"><HI>Q.</HI> But why &s;hould not the &s;cripture ex|plain it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e if they did, we &s;hould not be able to under&s;tand them. There are &s;ome things in the &s;criptures, which relate to God; and other things which relate to man. <HI>Secret things,</HI> we are told, <HI>belong unto the Lord.</HI> We may however believe the&s;e things, tho we do not under&s;tand them. It is enough, if we have &s;ufficient proof that the &s;criptures are true, and that what relates to our&s;elves is plain, and ea&s;y.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What then are the thoughts, which the &s;ufferings of Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould rai&s;e in our minds?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We &s;hould reflect with the highe&s;t gra|titude on his great kindne&s;s in laying down his life for our &s;ake; we &s;hould think with the deepe&s;t humility on our &s;inful nature which occa&s;ioned it; and always have in our minds how ungrateful we are, if we do not leave off our &s;ins, and lead good lives, which is all the return he requires.</P>

<P><PB N="14" REF="20"><HI>A.</HI> Mankind's corrupt and &s;inful nature, &s;ince the fall of Adam. The &s;criptures tell us we <HI>can do no good thing without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;pirit of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> If that be the ca&s;e, and we can do no|thing good without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;pirit of God, what good is there in any thing we can do, for the &s;pirit of God does it for us?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We have a choice, either to li&s;ten to the holy &s;pirit of God, or to the temptations of the world: and our goodne&s;s depends on little more than that choice. God al&s;o gives us opportunities of being good, and we may im|prove them, or throw them behind us, as we chu&s;e. If we improve them, his holy &s;pirit will farther a&s;&s;i&s;t us.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> My not feeling it, is no more a rea&s;on for my di&s;believing it, than my not feeling my &s;oul is a rea&s;on for my di&s;believing I have one. As the &s;criptures therefore a&s;&s;ure me I &s;hall be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the holy &s;pirit of God, and as it is not in the lea&s;t more difficult to believe, than the union of my &s;oul, and body, I believe it.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do you mean, that the du&s;t, into which your body will be crumbled, &s;hall be|come again a living body?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes. There is no more rea&s;on for my di&s;believing, that God will rai&s;e my body again from the du&s;t, than that God created man at fir&s;t out of du&s;t. So I believe the &s;cripture account of both.&mdash;Be&s;ides, I &s;ee many things in the world like &s;uch a re&s;ur|rection.

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, many: This world has every where the appearance of a &s;tate of trial&mdash;ra|ther than of a &s;tate of full reward and puni&s;h|ment.

<P><HI>Q.</HI> In what does the happine&s;s of the next world con&s;i&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We can know only what the &s;criptures tell us. They do not explain the happine&s;s of the next world, but ju&s;t inform us that it will be very great.

<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do you mean by the <HI>doctrines of &s;cripture?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="27"><HI>A.</HI> I mean particularly the divinity of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour&mdash;his atonement for the &s;ins of mankind&mdash;the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the holy &s;pirit&mdash; the re&s;urrection of the dead&mdash;and a la&s;t judgment.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> A di&s;regard to God, and religion&mdash; &s;abbath-breaking&mdash;&s;wearing&mdash;lying&mdash;cheat|ing &mdash;envy&mdash;malice&mdash;hatred&mdash;lewd di&s;cour&s;e and actions.

<P><HI>Q.</HI> What does the &s;cripture require, if you have been unhappily drawn into &s;in?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It requires us to repent of it, that it may not become habitual.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do you mean by habitual &s;in?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A &s;in that is committed over and over, without any check of con&s;cience. As &s;ome wicked people, for in&s;tance, have gotten &s;o

vile a cu&s;tom of &s;wearing, that they will &s;ome|times &s;wear, and hardly know when they &s;wear.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> No: becau&s;e they have brought them|&s;elves into that condition through their own fault.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> So again when people get drunk, and commit mi&s;chief, is their drunkenne&s;s an ex|cu&s;e for them?</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do you mean by <HI>repenting?</HI></P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> But &s;uppo&s;e you had told a lie, and yet would not tell another, tho you were &s;ure nobody could find you out; is that re|penting of it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: becau&s;e in that ca&s;e, I am not
<PB N="23" REF="29">
afraid of puni&s;hment; but of doing a wrong thing.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> And on a &s;uppo&s;ition, that you truly repent of your &s;ins, what do you hope from God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I humbly hope, that my &s;ins will be blotted out through the merits of Chri&s;t&mdash;that my own endeavours will be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by God's holy &s;pirit&mdash;and that I &s;hall be reconciled to God, and re&s;tored to his favour.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But you learn from the holy &s;criptures, you &s;ay, to <HI>practice goodne&s;s,</HI> as well as to <HI>avoid wickedne&s;s,</HI>&mdash;to love your neighbour, in the fir&s;t place, as your&s;elf: What do you mean by loving your Neighbour as your|&s;elf?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I mean being as ready to do good to him, as to receive good from him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Whom do you mean by your neigh|bour?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> All mankind, as appears from many parts of &s;cripture; but e&s;pecially from our Saviour's parable of the good Samaritan. The Jews con&s;idered the Samaritans as ene|mies; and as we learn from the parable to do good to our enemies, it &s;urely follows, that we &s;hould do good to all mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How are you to act in order to do to others, as you might rea&s;onably de&s;ire them to do to you?</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="30"><HI>A.</HI> Whenever I am going to do any thing to another, and am doubtful whether it be right, I &s;hould a&s;k my&s;elf, whether, in the &s;ame ca&s;e, I &s;hould like to have it done to me; and if I &s;hould not, I may be &s;ure, it is not right that I &s;hould do it to another.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do you mean by doing your duty faithfully, whatever your &s;tation is, <HI>as to the Lord, and not unto man?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I mean, that I &s;hould con&s;ider my&s;elf as a part of God's great family, which con&s;i&s;ts of all mankind. In this great family, God places &s;ome high, and others low. But every per&s;on has his &s;tation to fill; which he &s;hould endeavour to fill faithfully. And as God is our great ma&s;ter, our fir&s;t rea&s;on for doing our duty &s;hould be to plea&s;e him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How &s;hould the rich fill their &s;tations?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They &s;hould con&s;ider them as tru&s;ts in|tended for the general good. Different &s;tati|ons are nece&s;&s;ary for the good of all. Every one at &s;ight mu&s;t acknowledge, that neither the government of a family, a pari&s;h, or a country could &s;ub&s;i&s;t, if all were on an equa|lity. Tho the rich therefore mu&s;t live in a degree &s;uitable to their &s;everal &s;tations, they mu&s;t have an e&s;pecial care not to &s;uffer that notion to carry them into extravagance, or the neglect of the great duty of di&s;tributing from their abundance among their poorer

neighbours. If they are &s;o ab&s;urd, as to con|ceive, that God Almighty has placed them in &s;uperior &s;tations, out of any particular re|gard, which he has for them; and &s;o leaves them at liberty to &s;pend all they have upon them&s;elves, they will in the end find them|&s;elves &s;adly mi&s;taken; and will have a &s;trict account to give (as our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour tells them) of the talents, with which they have been intru&s;ted.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How &s;hould the poor per&s;on fill his &s;tation &s;o as to plea&s;e God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He &s;hould do all the good in his power with his little; and be content al&s;o, and &s;atis|fied with his &s;tation. He may a&s;&s;ure him|&s;elf that if he be <HI>religious, frugal,</HI> and <HI>indus|trious,</HI> he may enjoy all the real happine&s;s, which this world is capable of giving. His indu&s;try and frugality will &s;upply him with the nece&s;&s;aries of life; and his religion will teach him, that a <HI>man's life,</HI> (that is, his hap|pine&s;s) <HI>con&s;i&s;teth not in the abundance of the things which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> On a &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;he rich and poor fill their &s;tations equally well, how will God reward them?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Ju&s;t alike; as appears from different parts of &s;cripture; but particularly from the widow's mite. She could do very little in compari&s;on with the rich; and yet Chri&s;t

&s;ays, &s;he did more than they all&mdash;that is, &s;he had a better di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e if he do not always endeavour to be better than he is, it is much to be fear|ed, he is growing wor&s;e. True religion al|ways makes a man wi&s;h to be better.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> The &s;acraments you &s;ee then are not only the &s;igns of our receiving the privileges of chri&s;tianity; but they hold out to us, the two greate&s;t truths of our religion. What are tho&s;e truths?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Bapti&s;m holds out to us, that we are <HI>fallen &s;inners,</HI> by &s;hewing us, through the &s;ign of water, that we mu&s;t be purified by the grace of the go&s;pel.&mdash;And the Lord's Supper &s;hews us by the &s;igns of bread and wine, that we can only be pardoned through the atoneing blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But now as Chri&s;t hath ordained both the&s;e &s;acraments, why do not all chri&s;tians think it as nece&s;&s;ary to receive the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper, as to bring their child|ren to be baptized?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought; but &s;ome neglect it, as they do other good things: and &s;ome are afraid of texts of &s;cripture, which they do not under&s;tand.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What texts of &s;cripture are they afraid of?</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="35"><HI>A.</HI> Chiefly of a pa&s;&s;age in St. Paul, where he &s;ays, <HI>He that eateth and drinketh unwor|thily, eateth and drinketh damnation to him|&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> To whom is the expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>eating and drinking unworthily</HI> applied?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is applied chiefly to the Corinthians, who were guilty of drunkenne&s;s, and other crimes, when they received the Lord's &s;upper, which was admini&s;tered then in private hou&s;es; and often at the time of fea&s;ting. Whereas we, who receive it in churches, where there is no fea&s;ting, cannot be guilty of the &s;ame wicked practices, of which the Corinthians were guilty: tho at the &s;ame time, we may receive the &s;acrament <HI>unworthily,</HI> if we do not piou&s;ly remember the death and atonement of Chri&s;t, when we receive it; and re&s;olve as far as we can, to for&s;ake our &s;ins, which were the cau&s;e of his death</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do mean by <HI>eating and drinking damnation to your&s;elf?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This is &s;till applied to the unworthy manner in which the Corinthians received the Lord's &s;upper: tho the word <HI>damnation</HI> means only, that God will <HI>condemn</HI> us, or be angry with us, for <HI>eating and drinking un|worthily,</HI> as he is for all other wicked things: but it does not mean, that we &s;hall certainly be <HI>damned</HI> for it.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="36"><HI>Q.</HI> What rea&s;on is there for your receiving the &s;acrament of bapti&s;m only once; and the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper frequently?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e we can only once enter into the chri&s;tian religion; but we are required frequently to &s;hew, that we are members of it, by remembring the death and atonement of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and by renewing the engagements, which we made, when we be|came members of his holy religion.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> You &s;aid you believed, that <HI>God would a&s;&s;i&s;t you by his holy &s;pirit,</HI> as you could do nothing to plea&s;e God without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: how is the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his holy &s;pirit to be obtained?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I mu&s;t fir&s;t pray to God through the mediation of Chri&s;t, for this holy a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and at the &s;ame time I mu&s;t u&s;e my own be&s;t endeavours in doing what I can my&s;elf; tru&s;ting in God, that he will enable me to overcome &s;uch temptations, as I could not overcome without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> La&s;tly, you &s;ay, <HI>you believe in a future &s;tate,</HI> and in the <HI>re&s;urrection of the dead</HI>&mdash;that
<PB N="31" REF="37">
is, you &s;ay, you believe you &s;hall live in ano|ther world, after you leave this: and that even your body will not remain in the grave; but will ri&s;e again, and be joined to your &s;oul: if then you really and &s;incerely <HI>believe</HI> all this, what <HI>effect</HI> &s;hould it have upon you?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It &s;hould rai&s;e my thoughts above this mortal life. I &s;hould not think intirely about this world; but con&s;ider that I am to live in another world after this. And tho, while I live in this world, it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to think about its concerns, yet when I con&s;ider, that in the next world I am to live for ever; and in this world only a few years, it is certainly right, that I &s;hould think more about the next world, than about this.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> You &s;ay likewi&s;e that you <HI>believe in a la&s;t judgment</HI>&mdash;that is, you &s;ay, you believe that hereafter you &s;hall be called to account for every thing you have done in this world; and that you &s;hall be rewarded, or puni&s;hed, according to what you have done: Now if you really believe this great truth, how &s;hould you be <HI>affected</HI> by it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I &s;hould be in earne&s;t careful to pre|pare my &s;elf for this awful judgment by &s;incerely endeavouring to do my duty to God, and man; or in other words, by <HI>believing</HI> and <HI>living as a chri&s;tian ought to do.</HI></P>

<P>ALMIGHTY God, who through thy good providence hath added one day more to our lives, graciou&s;ly accept our prai&s;e and thank&s;giving for this, and all thy other mercies&mdash;for our creation&mdash;our con|&s;tant pre&s;ervation&mdash;and particularly for the hopes of future happine&s;s, which thou ha&s;t given us through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash; That we may turn all thy mercies, as thou in|tende&s;t them, into ble&s;&s;ings, grant us the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of thy holy &s;pirit, to make this, and every day, an improvement of the la&s;t. May we always con&s;ider thou ha&s;t created us to make us happy in heaven, if it be not through our own fault. Grant therefore, O Lord, that we may con&s;ider &s;in of every kind, as the wor&s;t of all evils, becau&s;e it will de&s;troy our &s;ouls.&mdash;And if, through the frailty of hu|man nature, we &s;hould be &s;o unhappy, as to di&s;plea&s;e thee by doing what we know is wrong, grant us thy grace immediately to re|pent, and for&s;ake it from our hearts, implo|ring thy forgivene&s;s, through the merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who died to redeem us from &s;in.&mdash;Let thy holy &s;pirit, O Lord, guide,
