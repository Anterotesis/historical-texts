<P>THE LORD OF THE MANOR, A COMIC OPERA, AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many unplea&s;ing cir|cum&s;tances attending the
concealed writer of a dramatic piece (and they are more than are apt at fir&s;t
to occur to him), it is not one of the lea&s;t con&s;iderable to a liberal
mind, that other per&s;ons become &s;ufferers by his failings. Thus while the
real Author, on one hand, has enjoyed the compliment of having the Lord of the
Manor a&s;cribed to &s;e|veral men, for whom it is great literary cre|dit to be
mi&s;taken; &s;o, on the other, he has had the pain to &s;ee critici&s;m
extended from poetical to political principles, and made a vehicle for party
reflections upon per&s;ons who never &s;aw a line of his writing. Not only have
the erroneous gue&s;&s;es &s;hifted from man to man, they have fallen al&s;o
upon men in a body: different &s;cenes have been given to dif|ferent pens; and
&s;ometimes the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed writers have multiplied upon the imagina|tion,
'till they became almo&s;t as numerous as the per&s;onages of the drama.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="3">Perhaps an apology may be due to every man who
has been charged with this found|ling; and the more e&s;pecially as the parent
him&s;elf means to continue &s;till unknown&mdash;confe&s;&s;ing ingenuou&s;ly
at the &s;ame time, that his temptations to break from his con|cealment far
over-balance his di&s;courage|ments: for after duly weighing every de|fect of
fable, conduct, dialogue, &amp;c. with which the &s;evere&s;t critic could tax
him, what candidate for prai&s;e in poetry would not bear the weight ten-fold,
for the &s;ole pride of avowing in his own name the &s;ongs which by many
re&s;pectable judges have been attri|buted to Mr. SHERIDAN?</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to trouble the reader with the motives upon
which &s;o flattering a gra|tification is re&s;i&s;ted.&mdash;Some of them
perhaps are mere peculiarities of temper&mdash;Suffice it to &s;ay, that they
are &s;uch, upon the whole, as induce this Author to reque&s;t the few friends,
who nece&s;&s;arily have been entru&s;ted with his &s;ecret, not to think
them&s;elves at liberty, from any thing here &s;aid, to divulge it. For his own
part he is de&s;irous &s;o far to &s;atisfy the public curio&s;ity (if
curio&s;ity re|mains upon &s;o trifling a &s;ubject) as to declare that every
word in the following Opera is the production of a &s;ingle per&s;on; and
&s;hould a mi&s;take &s;till re&s;t upon any individual, it is
<PB N="vii" REF="4"> fit that the burthen &s;hould be made as light as
po&s;&s;ible, by removing &s;ome prejudices which have been bevelled unju&s;tly
again&s;t the <HI>man,</HI> whatever may become of others which may have been
conceived again&s;t the <HI>piece.</HI></P>
<P>Be it known, then, that the&s;e &s;cenes were written la&s;t
&s;ummer in the country for mere amu&s;ement&mdash;to relax a mind which had
been engaged in more inten&s;e application&mdash;and the only view in bringing
them upon the &s;tage was a continuation of amu&s;ement, encou|raged and
enhanced by the reflection, that, if they were defective in many parts, they
were harmle&s;s in all; that although they might not correct the follies, they
would not offend the morals of the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>It could not but be matter of &s;urpri&s;e and &s;ome pain to a
writer intent upon the&s;e prin|ciples, to find him&s;elf accu&s;ed of having
in|troduced the character of Captain Trepan, for the purpo&s;e of impeding the
recruiting &s;er|vice of the army. To be thought a bad Poet, is but a common
misfortune, and it may be borne with temper and in &s;ilence; but the
imputation of being an ill-intention|ed citizen requires an an&s;wer, though in
this ca&s;e, it is tru&s;ted, a &s;hort one will &s;uffice.</P>
<P>The writer has ever conceived, that as to &s;hew the enormous
vices of the time in their <PB N="viii" REF="5"> utmo&s;t deformity ought to be
the great end of dramatic &s;atire; &s;o, in a le&s;&s;er degree, to ex|po&s;e
to ridicule any practice that &s;avoured more of abu&s;e than ab&s;olute vice,
had its u&s;e. They who think the fallacies and frauds of recruiting dealers
about this town nece&s;&s;ary evils, which ought to be connived at, as
contributary to the military &s;trength of the nation, are ignorant of facts,
or blind to con|&s;equences. So little is the writer of that opinion, that he
has thought it incumbent upon him to re&s;tore in print the pa&s;&s;ages which
from apprehen&s;ion of &s;udden mi&s;con|&s;tructions, and from no other
apprehen&s;ion, were omitted in the repre&s;entation. An abler hand might have
carried &s;atire on this &s;ubject infinitely further, not only with a
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing no harm, but al&s;o a confidence of doing good.
Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for illu&s;tration-&s;ake, that his Maje&s;ty were
plea&s;ed to command the Fir&s;t Part of King Henry IV. and to order all the
boxes to be kept for the new Commanders, which the policy of the times (from
the &s;carcity un|doubtedly of veterans) has placed at the head of corps
rai&s;ing or to be rai&s;ed; and one of the galleries devoted exclu&s;ively to
the Crimp Cap|tains and their Subalterns&mdash;might not public benefit be
united with entertainment by a ju&s;t exhibition of old Jack Fal&s;taff's
levies? and <PB N="ix" REF="6"> &s;hould it happen that any per&s;on pre&s;ent
in &s;uch an audience were con&s;cious of
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>having mi&s;u&s;ed the King's pre&s;s
damnably</HI>"</Q>&mdash;or from any other cau&s;e were
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>a&s;hamed of his
raga|muffins</HI>"</Q>&mdash;&s;urely he could not but feel grate|ful for &s;o
gentle a hint! and we might &s;ee effected by wit and mirth, a reformation,
which under a har&s;h Sovereign might have been thought de&s;erving of direct
and exem|plary reprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>A more &s;erious defence can hardly be re|qui&s;ite upon this
&s;ubject, after publication of the piece. At the Theatre, where the atten|tion
naturally (and in this in&s;tance mo&s;t de|&s;ervedly) has re&s;ted much upon
the mu&s;ic, the public &s;entiments &s;incerely meant to be inculcated may
have e&s;caped notice; but, in the clo&s;et, the writer, without a &s;hadow of
fear, re&s;ts his ju&s;tification from the charge of ill-will to the military
&s;ervice, upon pa&s;&s;ages too numerous to be pointed out. He might almo&s;t
&s;ay upon every character of the Drama&mdash;but particularly upon that of
Tru|more, where the two extremes of that pa&s;|&s;ion which fills, or ought to
fill, every youthful brea&s;t, is employed to excite mar|tial ardour: in one
in&s;tance, <HI>di&s;appointment</HI> and <HI>de&s;pondency</HI> in love are
made the motives for enli&s;ting as a private &s;oldier; in the other,
<HI>&s;ucce&s;s</HI> in love, the &s;upreme happine&s;s <PB N="x" REF="7"> in
human exi&s;tence, is not admitted as an excu&s;e for relinqui&s;hing the
military &s;ervice during the exigencies of our country.</P>
<P>To di&s;avow the a&s;per&s;ion I have men|tioned, was the
principal purpo&s;e of this ad|dre&s;s to the candour of the reader; but
hav|ing taken up the pen, I will venture to offer to his further indulgence a
few thoughts upon Opera, and particularly that &s;pecies of it attempted in the
en&s;uing pages.</P>
<P>The Opera is a favourite entertainment in all the polite countries
of Europe, but in none, that I know of, held &s;ubject to the laws of regular
Drama. There is neither u&s;age nor &s;tatute of critici&s;m (if I may u&s;e
that expre&s;|&s;ion) to try it by, unle&s;s we look for &s;uch in &s;ome
mu&s;ical code. Meta&s;ta&s;io, though a very re&s;pectable &s;tage writer, has
never been brought to the &s;ame bar with Corneille or Racine, or any other
profe&s;&s;ors of correct Tragedy. The vital principle and very &s;oul of
Italian Opera is mu&s;ic; and provided it be well maintained in compo&s;ition
and execu|tion, every incon&s;i&s;tency, in fable, conduct, or character, is
not only always pardoned, but often applauded.</P>
<P>The French Opera (without entering into the di&s;puted points
concerning its mu&s;ic, or denying the many beautiful pa&s;&s;ages which may be
extracted from its poetry) is if po&s;&s;ible <PB N="xi" REF="8"> more ab&s;urd
than the Italian in its departure from probability. To the powers of &s;ound is
added all that decoration, machinery, beauty, and grace, can &s;upply to
enchant the eye and the fancy; and &s;o forcible, it mu&s;t be al|lowed, is
their effect, that the judgement re|ceives no &s;hock, when tyrants and lovers,
heroes and pea&s;ants, Gods and devils, are &s;inging and dancing in amicable
chorus all together.</P>
<P>The reader will go with me in applying every thing yet &s;aid to
the &s;erious or great Opera. Another &s;pecies, but no more of the legitimate
family of Comedy than the for|mer is of Tragedy, has been introduced in all the
countries I have alluded to. In Eng|land both have been in u&s;e in our native
language, but with very different &s;ucce&s;s. I have no he&s;itation in
pronouncing an opi|nion, that the adopting what is called reci|tative into a
language, to which it is totally incongruous, is the cau&s;e of failure in an
Engli&s;h &s;erious Opera much oftener than the want of mu&s;ical powers in the
performers. In countries where the inflection of voice in recitative upon the
&s;tage is little more than what the ear is u&s;ed to in common di&s;cour&s;e,
the dialogue of the drama is &s;u&s;tained and &s;trengthened by a great
compa&s;s of tones; but in our northern climates, in proportion
<PB N="xii" REF="9"> as the ordinary expre&s;&s;ion comes nearer mo|notony,
recitative, or mu&s;ical dialogue, will &s;eem the more prepo&s;terous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Addi&s;on upon this &s;ubject, Spectator N^o. 29,
and others of his papers upon the Opera.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I will not contend (though I have my doubts) that it is
impo&s;&s;ible for genius to in|vent, and for voice to deliver, a &s;ort of
reci|tative that the Engli&s;h language will bear. But it mu&s;t be widely
different from the Ita|lian. If any &s;pecimens can yet be produced of it's
having been effected, they will be found to con&s;i&s;t only of a few lines
introductive of the air which is to follow, and as &s;uch re|ceived by the ear
ju&s;t as &s;ymphony would be. Very few &s;erious pieces, except Artaxerxes,
can be recollected upon our Theatre where it has not entirely failed, even when
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by action: in Oratorios it is, with a few ex|ceptions, and
tho&s;e &s;u&s;tained by accompani|ment, a &s;oporific that even the thunder of
Handel's choru&s;&s;es are hardly loud enough to overcome.</P>
<P>There may be enthu&s;ia&s;ts in mu&s;ic who will treat the
di&s;reli&s;h I have de&s;cribed to want of ear. Let ear be under&s;tood merely
as the organ by which the mind is to receive more or le&s;s delight from
&s;ublime Engli&s;h ver&s;e, and I &s;hould be happy to &s;ee the di&s;|pute
brought to public i&s;&s;ue&mdash;the te&s;t &s;hould be the performance of
Alexander's Fea&s;t as <PB N="xiii" REF="10"> now &s;et to mu&s;ic throughout;
and the per|formance of that inimitable ode, with the &s;ongs alone pre&s;erved
in mu&s;ic, and the re&s;t delivered by Mrs. Yates without accompa|niment, or
other melody, than her empha|tic elocution.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t that in contending again&s;t mu&s;ical dialogue in
Engli&s;h, I &s;hall not be under|&s;tood to think that all mu&s;ic is
inapplicable to the higher compo&s;itions of our &s;tage. On the contrary I am
convinced that under judicious management mu&s;ic is capable of giving them
effect beyond what our be&s;t au|thors can attain without it&mdash;mu&s;ic can
add energy to Shak&s;peare him&s;elf. Indignant as an Engli&s;h audience would
be to hear King Lear deliver him&s;elf in recitative, I believe no per&s;on,
who had a heart or ta&s;te, ever contemplated the mute groupe of Cordelia with
the aged parent a&s;leep in her lap, and the phy&s;ician watching by, without
an en|crea&s;e of &s;en&s;ibility from the &s;oft mu&s;ic which Mr. Garrick
introduced into that &s;cene. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation will hold good with
re&s;pect to the additional horror excited in Macbeth, and delight in the
Tempe&s;t, from the judicious u&s;e of both &s;ong and in|&s;truments. I cannot
help quoting another in&s;tance of the application of mu&s;ic which I have
always thought a happy one. At the clo&s;e of the tragedy of the Game&s;ter,
when <PB N="xiv" REF="11"> the di&s;tre&s;s is rai&s;ed to &s;uch a pitch that
lan|guage fails under it, how forcibly is the im|pre&s;&s;ion left upon the
audience by mu&s;ic, accompanying the &s;low de&s;cent of the cur|tain over the
mournful picture! How pre|ferable &s;uch a conclu&s;ion to the u&s;ual one of
an actor &s;traddling over dead bodies to deliver a tame moral in tame rhime to
the pit, in the &s;ame breath, and often in the &s;ame tone, in which he is to
give out the play. But &s;urely no man can be &s;o void of di&s;cernment as not
to &s;ee clearly the difference between recitative and mu&s;ic thus applied:
the one diverts the attention from &s;en&s;e to &s;ound, breaks the propriety
and very nerve of our language, and by giving to the expre&s;&s;ion of the
pa&s;&s;ions cadences of which we never heard an example, nor can form a
concep|tion in real life, de&s;troys that delu&s;ion and charm of fancy which
makes the &s;ituations before us our own, and is the e&s;&s;ence of dra|matic
repre&s;entation: the other, upon the principle of the chorus of the antients,
&s;erves to excite and to combine attention and emo|tion, and to improve and to
continue upon the mind the impre&s;&s;ions mo&s;t worthy to be retained.</P>
<P>I am aware that I have entered further into the grave Drama than
my &s;ubject re|quired; but the digre&s;&s;ion will be found ex|cu&s;able, in
as much as the &s;ame doctrine ap|plies <PB N="xv" REF="12"> to comic
productions, and as it will &s;erve to &s;horten the trouble of the reader in
what I have further to offer.</P>
<P>One branch of comic opera which meets with &s;ucce&s;s on our
&s;tage is evidently a graft from the Burletta of the Italians; and little as I
may admire it in general, I will venture to &s;ay, re&s;pectively to the
writing, it is im|proved in our &s;oil. Midas, the Golden Pippin, and &s;ome
others, con&s;idered as pieces of parody and burle&s;que, are much better than
any Italian Burletta I know. In fact, there is in general in the Italian Drama
of this name an in&s;ipidity, mixed with a buffoonery too low to be called
farci|cal, which would make the repre&s;entation in&s;upportable in England,
were the language under&s;tood, or attended to in any other view than as the
introduction and di&s;play of ex|qui&s;ite mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>I cannot ea&s;ily bring my&s;elf to allow the higher branch of our
Comic Opera, to be of foreign extraction. From the time the Beg|gar's Opera
appeared, we find pieces in pro&s;e, with &s;ongs inter&s;per&s;ed, &s;o
approaching to regular Comedy in plot, incident, and pre|&s;ervation of
character, as to make them a di|&s;tinct &s;pecies from any thing we find
abroad&mdash;and is it too much to add that the &s;en&s;e, wit, and humour to
be found in &s;ome of them are &s;terling Engli&s;h marks by which we
<PB N="xvi" REF="13"> may claim the &s;pecies as our own? The mu|&s;ical pieces
at Paris, upon the Theatre called <HI>Les Italiens,</HI> &s;prung up from the
decline of a &s;ort of Drama where half the per&s;onages were Italian, as was
half the language. When Harlequin and Argentine grew un|fa&s;hionable, &s;uch
other repre&s;entations as &s;erved be&s;t for an hour of mere di&s;&s;ipation
&s;ucceeded, and the light and ea&s;y mu&s;ic with which they were accompanied,
made them very popular. But the pieces are either pa|rodies, or founded in
general upon materials which would be thought in England too flimzy for any
thing but an after-piece. They are compo&s;ed with an amu&s;ing playful|ne&s;s
of imagination, which runs Love thro' all its divi&s;ions, and u&s;ually
contain abun|dance of very pretty vocal mu&s;ic with a &s;car|city of incident
and little variety of charac|ter. It is not intended to degrade or depre|ciate
this &s;tile of writing as applicable to a Paris audience: it is only meant to
&s;tate it more widely &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from the force and &s;pirit of
regular comedy than our own. They who are unacquainted with the Paris theatre,
are referred for judgement upon this &s;ubject to the De&s;erter, Zemira and
Azor, and other direct tran&s;lations; and to Daphne and Amintor, and Thomas
and Sally, and other after-pieces, very good in their kind, but written after
the French man|ner. <PB N="xvii" REF="14"> The Padlock is above this cla&s;s in
di&s;|play of characters; and the French have no|thing upon their Mu&s;ical
Comic Stage to compare, as re&s;embling <HI>Comedy,</HI> with Love in a
Village, or the Maid of the Mill, or, to take &s;till greater credit to our
Theatre, the Duenna.</P>
<P>The Lord of the Manor, although the leading incident of the
&s;tory is profe&s;&s;edly taken from the Silvain of Marmontel, is an humble
attempt at the &s;pecies of Opera which I have ventured to call Engli&s;h, and
to de|&s;cribe as a drama the next in gradation below regular Comedy, and which
might perhaps be carried a &s;tep above it. It will not there|fore be thought
want of attention to the ex|cellencies of Marmontel's piece, which as adapted
to French manners I believe no man of ta&s;te will di&s;pute, but re&s;pect and
prefer|ence to our &s;tage, that induced me to alter and enlarge the plan and
conduct of the original, to &s;ub&s;titute characters, and to add &s;cenes and
circum&s;tances entirely new.</P>
<P>I know not a feature of character pre|&s;erved from Marmontel,
except the &s;en&s;ibi|lity and artle&s;s innocence of the young
wo|men&mdash;qualities, which, to be truly repre|&s;ented, admit of little
diver&s;ity by change of country.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be &s;orry if taking part, or even the whole of a
&s;tory from a foreign &s;tage, when <PB N="xviii" REF="15"> &s;uch &s;tory can
be made applicable to our cu&s;|toms and characters, and is entirely new worked
up for that purpo&s;e, could be deemed plagiari&s;m, becau&s;e it would be a
confine|ment to the invention rather pedantick than u&s;eful.</P>
<P>But while I am taking credit for borrow|ing &s;o little as one
incident, there may be tho&s;e who think I had better have borrowed a great
deal more. I can only &s;ay that tran&s;lation, or imitation, would have co&s;t
le&s;s pains, as it is ea&s;ier to &s;pin
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Filer le Sentiment.</NOTE> &s;entiment,
than to delineate character, and to write twenty &s;ongs to plea&s;e the ear,
than half as many lines of &s;uch Comedy as ought to &s;atisfy the judgement. I
do not contend that a direct copy of Marmontel would not have been a much
better thing than my talents have been able to make; I only in&s;i&s;t it would
no have been Engli&s;h drama. Continued uninterrupt|ed &s;cenes of tenderne&s;s
and &s;en&s;ibility <HI>(Comedie larmoyante)</HI> may plea&s;e the very
refined, but the bulk of an Engli&s;h audience, including many of the be&s;t
under&s;tanding, go to a comic performance to laugh in &s;ome part of it at
lea&s;t. They claim a right to do &s;o upon precedents of our mo&s;t valued
plays&mdash;and every author owes it to them, &s;o long as the merrie&s;t
among&s;t them &s;hews he is equal|ly <PB N="xix" REF="16"> capable of
reli&s;hing and applauding what is elevated and affecting&mdash;an
ob&s;ervation I have always &s;een hold good in an Engli&s;h gallery.</P>
<P>It might be a&s;&s;uming too much to quote any pa&s;&s;ages from
the Lord of the Manor, as a te&s;t that every part of the hou&s;e can re|li&s;h
refined &s;entiment; but were the fact ten times more apparent, I &s;hould
&s;till adhere to my former opinion, and intermix mirth: the cen&s;ure of a
critic of fa&s;hion here and there in the boxes, who reckon every thing low
which is out of their own &s;phere, would never per&s;uade me to turn Moll
Flagon out of my piece (ea&s;y as it would be to conduct the &s;tory without
her) while &s;he excites &s;o much plea&s;ure in general, as to prove the
character can neither be fal&s;e in nature, nor void of humour.</P>
<P>And now a few words upon what I con|ceive would be the plan of
writing, were men of genius and ta&s;te to try a &s;pecimen of correct
mu&s;ical comedy.</P>
<P>In a repre&s;entation which is to hold
<Q REND="inline">"a mirror up to nature,"</Q> and which ought to
draw its chief applau&s;e from rea&s;on, vocal mu&s;ic &s;hould be confined to
expre&s;s the feel|ings of the pa&s;&s;ions, but never to expre&s;s the
exerci&s;e of them. Song, in any action in which rea&s;on tells us it would be
unnatural to &s;ing, mu&s;t be prepo&s;terous. To fight a duel, to cudgel a
poltroon in cadence, may <PB N="xx" REF="17"> be borne in a burletta, upon the
&s;ame prin|ciple that in the &s;erious opera we &s;ee heroes fight lions and
mon&s;ters, and &s;ometimes ut|ter their la&s;t &s;truggles for life in &s;ong,
and die in &s;trict time and tune: but the&s;e liber|ties would be totally
inadmi&s;&s;ible in the kind of drama which I am recommending. My idea might be
further explained by a pa&s;&s;age in the piece of Marmontel before re|ferred
to. It appeared to one of the news|paper critics, that I had been guilty of a
great error in not introducing a &s;cene in the Silvain, wherein the <HI>Gardes
Cha&s;&s;e</HI> of the Seigneur attack the &s;port&s;man with guns in their
hands, threatening to &s;hoot him un|le&s;s he &s;urrenders his gun which he
per&s;i&s;ts in pre&s;erving. By the bye, this &s;ort of au|thority is more
natural in France than I hope it would <HI>yet</HI> be thought to be in
Eng|land: but that was not my principal objec|tion. This &s;cene upon the
French &s;tage is all in &s;ong; and even at Paris, where licence of throwing
action into &s;ong is &s;o much more in u&s;e than it is here, and where I have
often &s;een it excellently performed, the idea of five or &s;ix fellows with
fu&s;ils pre&s;ent|ed at a gentleman's head, and their fingers upon the
triggers, threatening his life in ba&s;s notes, he re&s;i&s;ting in tenor, and
a wife or daughter throwing her&s;elf between them in treble, while the
&s;pectator is kept in &s;u&s;|pence, <PB N="xxi" REF="18"> from what in
reality mu&s;t be a mo|mentary event, till the compo&s;er has run his air
through all its different branches, and to a great length, always gave me
di&s;gu&s;t to a great degree.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic, therefore, if employed to expre&s;s action, mu&s;t be
confined to dumb &s;hew. It is the very e&s;&s;ence of pantomime; and we have
lately &s;een upon the opera &s;tage how well a whole &s;tory may be told in
dance; but in all the&s;e in&s;tances mu&s;ic &s;tands in the place of
&s;peech, and is it&s;elf the only organ to expre&s;s the &s;entiments of the
actor.</P>
<P>To return to the application of vocal mu&s;ic upon the Engli&s;h
theatre: it mu&s;t not only be re&s;trained from having part in the exer|ci&s;e
or action of the pa&s;&s;ions; care mu&s;t be al&s;o taken, that it does not
interrupt or de|lay events for the i&s;&s;ue of which the mind is become eager.
It &s;hould always be the <HI>acce&s;&s;ory</HI> and not the <HI>principal</HI>
&s;ubject of the drama; but at the &s;ame time &s;pring out of it in &s;uch a
manner that the difference can hardly be di&s;cerned, and that it &s;hould
&s;eem neither the one nor the other could be &s;pared.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e re&s;trictions, vocal mu&s;ic
judiciou&s;ly managed would have many occa&s;ions to di&s;tingui&s;h its own
&s;pecific charms, at the &s;ame time that it embelli&s;h|ed,
<PB N="xxii" REF="19"> enriched, and elevated regular dramatic compo&s;itions.
In tragedy, I am convinced, the mind would peculiarly feel its powers.
<Q><L>Not touch'd but rapt, not waken'd but in&s;pir'd.</L></Q> In
the humbler, but not le&s;s in&s;tructive line of comedy, its office would be
to convey through the &s;weete&s;t channel, and to e&s;ta|bli&s;h by the mo&s;t
powerful impre&s;&s;ions upon the mind, maxim, admonition, &s;entiment,
virtue.</P>
<P>Should any thing I have &s;aid &s;trike a man of genius and
ta&s;te with the di&s;tinction I have endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h between
comic opera and mu&s;ical comedy, viz. between
<Q REND="inline">"elaborate trifles"</Q> made &s;econdary to
mu&s;ic, and &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit inculcated and &s;u&s;tained by it, new
&s;ubjects could not be wanting to engage their trials; or if it occurred to
men of that de&s;cription to try an experiment upon an old &s;ubject, and a
poet could be found courageous enough to engraft upon Shak&s;peare, as has been
done upon Milton in Comus; perhaps no &s;ubject could be found in the whole
range of fancy better fitted for mu&s;ical comedy than the play of "As you like
it." Indeed it &s;eems by &s;ome &s;ongs thrown into the original, that it was
the idea of the great author him&s;elf. To multiply the <PB N="xxiii" REF="20">
&s;ongs, excellent materials might be taken from the piece it&s;elf, without
injury to the eloquent and brilliant pa&s;&s;ages which are better adapt|ed to
the energy of elocution and action. And where materials failed in the original,
what true votary of the Mu&s;e would not find animation, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance
in his inven|tive faculties, from the pro&s;pect of being ad|mitted before the
public a companion to Shak&s;peare!</P>
<P>In the mean time the Lord of the Manor has been offered, not as an
example, but an excitement to improve that &s;pecies of drama&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;fungar vice cotis; acutum</L>
<L>Reddere quae ferrum valet, ex&s;ors ip&s;e &s;ecandi.</L></Q>
It would be affectation in me, as well as in|gratitude to the public, to deny
the plea&s;ure I have had in the very favourable reception of this piece. At
the &s;ame time I tru&s;t that I am duly &s;en&s;ible how much of the
&s;ucce&s;s is to be attributed to the exertions of the performers, the merits
of the Orche&s;tra, and the excellence of Mr. Jack&s;on's compo&s;ition. Among
all the circum&s;tances of &s;atisfaction, there is not one more plea&s;ing to
the reflec|tion than that the bringing this humble pro|duction upon the
&s;tage, has been the means of making me acquainted with a man who&s;e
<PB N="xxiv" REF="21"> harmony I &s;incerely believe to be character|i&s;tic of
his mind,&mdash;equal to any exertions, but peculiarly exqui&s;ite; when
expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ocial, tender, quiet, and amiable quali|ties of the
human heart.</P>
<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s this theatrical &s;ubject, up|on which I have
hazarded many opinions that for aught I know may be &s;ingly mine, I am free to
confe&s;s, that in calling upon men of genius to try the effect of my ideas, I
have had my eye particularly upon Mr. Sheridan. As an author, he is above my
en|comium; as a friend, it is my pride to think we are exactly upon a level.
From the con&s;ideration of him in both tho&s;e capacities, I feel my&s;elf
more intere&s;ted than the re&s;t of the world, in a performance he has &s;ome
time given us rea&s;on to expect. His Mu&s;e, though without participation of
my cau&s;e, will naturally and of nece&s;&s;ity be the advo|cate of it, by
verifying and exemplifying true mu&s;ical comedy; and &s;uch a &s;anction from
the author whom all re&s;pect, will be rendered doubly precious to my&s;elf by
its proceeding al&s;o from the man I love.</P>

<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even &s;o&mdash;for the &s;ole offence of a marriage with the
mo&s;t amiable of womankind, I received one of Sir John's re&s;cripts as he
calls the &s;ignification of his plea|&s;ure, with a note of a thou&s;and
pounds, and a prohi|bition of his pre&s;ence for ever. I knew his temper too

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right; but this oddity has all the effects of
har&s;hne&s;s. Sir John Contra&s;t has ever thought deci|&s;ion to be the
criterion of wi&s;dom; and is as much aver&s;e to retract an error as a right
action. In &s;hort, in his character, there is a continual variance between a
good heart and a perver&s;e head; and he often ap|pears angry with all mankind,
when in fact he is only out of humour with him&s;elf.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RASHLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I thought of different profe&s;&s;ions to &s;upport the rank
of a gentleman. I afterwards placed my elde&s;t daughter, then an infant, under
the care of a relation, and went abroad&mdash;There my Annette was born, and
for the &s;ake of oeconomy for &s;ome years educated. In &s;hort, after various
trials, I found I wanted &s;upple|ne&s;s for &s;ome of my pur&s;uits, and
talents perhaps for others; and my la&s;t re&s;ource was a cottage and love, in
the mo&s;t literal &s;en&s;e of both.</P>
</SP>

<P>I Confe&s;s, Annette, you are a very forward &s;cholar in

<P>Ju&s;t the contrary. Love, there, is the pa&s;&s;ion of all

<P>So they may too: it would be wrong if the tongue told fibs of
