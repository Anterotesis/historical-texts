<HEAD>ANECDOTES OF EMINENT PAINTERS IN <HI>SPAIN,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE city of Seville, in the lan|guage of Spain the Paragon of Cities, the World's Eighth Wonder and the mo&s;t famous, which the &s;un &s;urveys, has the ho|nour of giving birth to <HI>Diego Ve|lazquez de Silva,</HI> a painter, who by eminence in his art ro&s;e to every title and emolument, which his
<PB N="2" REF="4">
merit could claim, or fortune could be&s;tow: He was born in the year 1594 of <HI>Donna Geronima Velazquez</HI> by <HI>Juan Rodriguez de Silva,</HI> natives of the &s;ame illu&s;trious city, and both de&s;cended from antient and honourable hou&s;es; he bore his mo|ther's name <HI>Velazquez</HI> antecedent to that of his family, according to the u&s;age of Andalu&s;ia. The fa|mily of <HI>Silva</HI> is of Portugue&s;e ori|ginal and by long and honourable de&s;cent claims to derive from the antient kings of Alba-Longa. The hou&s;e of <HI>Silva</HI> in point of &s;plen|dour and antiquity is unque&s;tion|ably re&s;pectable; but I have little doubt, that it may &s;ay with many more that contend for Pagan ori|ginal
<PB N="3" REF="5">
in the language of the Pha|ri&s;ee <Q REND="inline">"Have we not Abraham for our father?"</Q> In like manner the family of Galvez, a family from the dregs of the people, availing them&s;elves of a fortuitous &s;imili|tude of name, pretend to derive from the Emperor Galba; a &s;illy vanity in men, whom chance has elevated into &s;tation and who by &s;tirring a que&s;tion, which no pru|dent man would have touched, on|ly provoke an enquiry, which traces them through a few ob&s;cure generations to their true Moori&s;h extraction. In &s;hort, Spain, which has as much or more of this pride of pedigree than any kingdom in Europe, is the one of all others with mo&s;t bars in its genealogy
<PB N="4" REF="6">
and that from very obvious cau&s;es adherent to its hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The parents of <HI>Velazquez,</HI> though in very narrow circum&s;tances, gave their &s;on a liberal education, and tradition has pre&s;erved many cir|cum&s;tances of his early docility as well as excellent di&s;po&s;ition: But when every paper, on which he wrote his puerile ta&s;ks, exhibited &s;ketches and drawings on the back and tho&s;e of &s;uch a &s;tile as plainly in|dicated a new and extraordinary genius in its dawn, the good &s;en&s;e of his parents did not he&s;itate upon humouring the impul&s;e and accor|dingly put him under the in&s;truc|tion of <HI>Franci&s;co de Herrera,</HI> com|monly called <HI>Old Herrera,</HI> a rigid ma&s;ter, but of con&s;ummate ability
<PB N="5" REF="7">
in the art he taught. The man|ners and temper of <HI>Old Herrera</HI> were however &s;o un&s;upportable to young <HI>Velazquez,</HI> that he left him and entered him&s;elf in the academy of <HI>Pacheco,</HI> a man of equal erudi|tion and of an admirable nature: Here his genius began to di&s;play it&s;elf in &s;everal &s;ketches from na|ture of pea&s;ants and ordinary peo|ple in peculiar habits and occupa|tions, as they &s;truck his fancy in the &s;treets or po&s;adas of the city. The&s;e fir&s;t &s;allies of his imagination give a &s;triking repre&s;entation of the manners and characters of the vulgar: They exhibit al&s;o a luxu|riancy of &s;till-life, that he has in|troduced in the &s;cenery of his pieces, in all which the co&s;tuma is
<PB N="6" REF="8">
ob&s;erved to perfection: One of his fir&s;t productions is to be &s;een in the palace of the Buen-Retiro and repre&s;ents an old Aguador in a tattered garment, which through its rents di&s;covers naked parts of his body, giving water to drink out of his barrel to a boy; a piece of wonderful nature and expre&s;&s;ion with a degree of &s;cience and preci|&s;ion in mu&s;cular anatomy, which is uncommon.</P>
<P>In &s;ubjects of this ru&s;tic &s;ort young <HI>Velazquez</HI> fuffered his ima|gination to di&s;port it&s;elf in its fir&s;t &s;allies, replying to &s;ome, that moved him to a&s;&s;ume a higher &s;tile of painting, that the founda|tion of his art mu&s;t be &s;trength; delicacy might follow after as the
<PB N="7" REF="9">
&s;uper&s;tructure. It &s;hould &s;eem in his fir&s;t productions, that he co|loured in the &s;tile of <HI>Caravaggio,</HI> but upon his &s;eeing &s;ome pictures of <HI>Guido, Pamarancio, Cavallero, Ballioni, Lanfranco</HI> and <HI>Ribera,</HI> which were brought to Seville out of Italy, he altered his manner; but the arti&s;t, upon who&s;e model he chiefly &s;tudied to form him&s;elf at this time, was <HI>Luis Tri&s;tan</HI> of Toledo, a &s;cholar of <HI>Dominico Greco.</HI> Of <HI>Tri&s;tan</HI> he declared him&s;elf an admirer and profe&s;&s;ed imitator; his de&s;ign, colouring and vivacity of invention, were the &s;tandard, to which he directed all his &s;tudies. In portraits <HI>Dominico Greco</HI> was his model, the air of his heads <HI>Velazquez</HI> held in the highe&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="10">
e&s;timation, and frequently ob|&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"that what this ma&s;ter did well was be&s;t of all good things, and what he did ill was bad in the extreme."</Q></P>
<P>Whil&s;t <HI>Velazquez</HI> was thus en|gaged in the practice, he by no means neglected the theory of his art; he read every author of cre|dit, that could form his judgment, or enlarge his &s;cience, and &s;ome he diligently &s;tudied, in particular <HI>Alberto Durero</HI> for the &s;ymmetry of the human figure; <HI>Andres Bexalio</HI> for anatomy: He read the trea|ti&s;e of <HI>Daniel Barbaro</HI> on per&s;pec|tive; <HI>Vitrubio, Vin~ola</HI> and others on architecture, and at the &s;ame time perfected him&s;elf in the pro|po&s;itions of Euclid; elements, that
<PB N="9" REF="11">
prepare the mind in every art and every &s;cience, to which the human faculties can be applied; which give a rule and mea&s;ure for every thing in life, dignify things fami|liar and familiarize things ab&s;tru&s;e; invigorate the rea&s;on, re&s;train the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of fancy, open all the avenues of truth and give a charm even to controver&s;y and di&s;|pute.</P>
<P>After five years thus &s;tudiou&s;ly employed in the academy he mar|ried <HI>Donna Juana,</HI> the daughter of his ma&s;ter <HI>Franci&s;co Pacheco,</HI> of a family and name as noble as any in Spain; this re&s;pectable arti&s;t in his Treati&s;e de la Pintura (Lib. 1. cap. 9), after an elogium on the merit of his pupil, declares, that
<PB N="10" REF="12">
he was moved to be&s;tow his daugh|ter upon him from the many de|mon&s;trations he gave of a mo&s;t vir|tuous and liberal di&s;po&s;ition, and the high expectation he had formed of his talents after an experience of five years, which he had &s;pent in &s;uperintending his education; and, after pronouncing prophetically of his &s;cholar's ri&s;ing fame, he de|clares, that &s;o far from regarding it with an eye of envy, he con&s;i|dered his own reputation advanced thereby in the &s;ame manner as <HI>Leo|nardo da Vinci</HI>'s was by <HI>Rafael, Ca&s;telfranco</HI>'s by <HI>Titiano,</HI> or <HI>Plato</HI>'s by <HI>Ari&s;totle. Velazquez,</HI> who by his marriage with <HI>Donna Juana</HI> had e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf to his con|tent, felt him&s;elf tempted to un|dertake
<PB N="11" REF="13">
a journey to Madrid, where and at the E&s;corial &s;o many trea|&s;ures of art were ama&s;&s;ed: In &s;hort, having &s;acrificed to the &s;ofter pa&s;|&s;ions, ambition came in turn to take dominion of his mind and, leaving <HI>Donna Juana</HI> at Seville, he &s;ate out with one attendant only for the capital, where he arrived in April of the year 1622, being then in his twenty-eighth year, an age when the mind of man de|mands expan&s;ion and a larger field of action than its native &s;cenes pre|&s;ent. <HI>Velazquez</HI> upon this vi&s;it to Madrid, not finding an opportu|nity of painting any of the royal per&s;ons of the court, returned af|ter a &s;hort &s;tay to Seville in &s;ome degree of di&s;gu&s;t; and here per|haps
<PB N="12" REF="14">
he might have &s;taid, as <HI>Mu|rillo</HI> afterwards did, for the re|mainder of his life, if he had not been earne&s;tly &s;olicited to return by the mini&s;ter <HI>Olivares,</HI> who em|ployed <HI>Gongora</HI> the court poet to invite him in his name and to offer the accommodations of his hou&s;e and family to him. Such an invi|tation was not to be with&s;tood and in the year following (viz. 1623) <HI>Velazquez</HI> for the &s;econd time ar|rived in Madrid.</P>
<P>He was now lodged in the hou&s;e of the prime mini&s;ter and was &s;oon admitted to take the portrait of the King, the In&s;ants and Olivares him&s;elf: This was the mo&s;t imme|diate cri&s;is of his fame and for|tune. Philip had been painted by
<PB N="13" REF="15">
mo&s;t of the eminent arti&s;ts of the time, <HI>Vincencio Carducho</HI> and his brother <HI>Bartolome, Angelo Nardi, Eugenio Caxes</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph Leonardo</HI> had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively exerted them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t in portraying the royal per&s;on of a young &s;overeign in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing, which could rou&s;e their emulation and reward their diligence: In the hou&s;e of the mini&s;ter Philip &s;at to <HI>Velazquez,</HI> and the date of this event is thought important enough to be pre&s;erved to po&s;terity, it was on the 30th of Augu&s;t 1623: The portrait was upon a large &s;cale, the King was drawn in armour and mounted upon a magnificent &s;teed and di&s;played with all the advan|tageous accompaniments of a beau|tiful
<PB N="14" REF="16">
&s;cenery in the back-ground: The arti&s;t &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h; the court rang with applau&s;e and all the cogno&s;centi joined in giving the palm to <HI>Velazquez</HI> above all his predece&s;&s;ors: So compleat was his triumph on this happy occa|&s;ion, that the mini&s;ter was com|manded to inform his inmate that the Royal per&s;on of Philip would in future be committed to no other pencil but his. In con&s;equence he proceeded to paint the Infants Don Carlos and Don Fernando, and after them he made a portrait of his patron Don Ga&s;par de Guz|man Conde de Olivares, mounted, like his Royal ma&s;ter, on a noble Andalu&s;ian cour&s;er, richly capa|ri&s;oned. If I may venture an ob|&s;ervation
<PB N="15" REF="17">
in the general upon the&s;e and others of his royal portraits, it is, that there &s;eems a labour in the arti&s;t, working under the impre&s;|&s;ion of the per&s;onal dignity of his &s;itters, to force a character of the &s;ublime, which &s;ometimes borders on the tumid and bomba&s;t: Every thing &s;wells and flutters; rich as the Spani&s;h hor&s;es are by nature, &s;till there &s;eems a pleona&s;m in their manes and tails, that borders on extravagance: But the reader &s;hould be reminded, that <HI>Rubens</HI> was now at Madrid in habits of in|timacy with <HI>Velazquez,</HI> that he had painted his figure of San Giorgio &s;laying the Dragon, the very quinte&s;&s;ence of colouring and the mo&s;t captivating example
<PB N="16" REF="18">
of extravagance which the art of painting can perhaps exhibit.</P>
<P>On the 17th day of March in this year Prince Charles of Eng|land had made his entry into Ma|drid; that Prince honoured <HI>Ve|lazquez</HI> with peculiar attention. He did not &s;it to him, but <HI>Velaz|quez</HI> took a &s;ketch of him as he was accompanying King Philip in the chace. When <HI>Velazquez</HI> had fini&s;hed his portrait of the King, he hung it up by royal permi&s;&s;ion in a public &s;treet of the city, op|po&s;ite the convent of San Phelipe; whil&s;t the courtiers applauded it to the &s;kies, and the poets made &s;onnets in his prai&s;e, the arti&s;ts &s;ilently pa&s;&s;ing by, pined with en|vy at the &s;ight. Fortune now be|gan
<PB N="17" REF="19">
to open all her trea&s;ures to the meritorious and happy <HI>Velazquez.</HI> On the la&s;t day of October 1623 he was made King's painter with a &s;alary of twenty ducats per month, exclu&s;ively of which he was paid for his pictures by tale: The royal munificence a&s;&s;igned him a hand|&s;ome hou&s;e to live in of two hun|dred ducats a year; Philip paid him three hundred ducats &s;or his portrait and granted a pen&s;ion of three hundred more by year &s;peci|&s;ically for this performance. Great rewards being thus heaped upon <HI>Velazquez,</HI> great things were ex|pected from him and, though the public &s;ub&s;cribed to his &s;upe|riority in portraitures, he had not executed yet any capital hi&s;torical
<PB N="18" REF="20">
piece, as his competitors <HI>Caxes, Carduchio</HI> and <HI>Nardi</HI> had done. Each of the&s;e had &s;ignalized them|&s;elves on a &s;ubject of great popular eclat, the Expul&s;ion of the Moors out of Spain by Philip the IIId; he again entered the li&s;ts with the&s;e arti&s;ts and, following them in their &s;ubjects, exhibited a &s;u|perb compo&s;ition, in the center of which he placed the King armed and in the act of giving directions to a party of &s;oldiers, who are e&s;|corting a groupe of Moors of dif|ferent ages and &s;exes to an embar|kation, which awaits them in one extremity of the canva&s;s; on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide he has per&s;onified the kingdom of Spain as a maje&s;tic matron in Roman armour with
<PB N="19" REF="21">
part of a &s;tately edifice, and this in&s;cription at her feet, viz. <Q REND="inline">"Phi|lippo III. Hi&s;pan. Regi Cathol. Regum pienti&s;&s;imo, Belgico, Germ. Afric. pacis et ju&s;titiae cultori publicae quietis a&s;&s;ertori ob eliminatos feliciter Mauros Philippus IV. robore ac virtute magnus, in magnis maximus, animo ad majora nato propter antiq. tanti parentis et pietatis ob&s;ervantiaeq. ergo trophaeum hoc erigit anno 1627."</Q> Below he &s;igns as follows, viz. <Q REND="inline">"Di|dacus Velazquez Hi&s;palen&s;is Philip IV. Regis Hi&s;pan. pictor, ip&s;iu&s;que ju&s;&s;u fecit anno 1627."</Q></P>
<P>No &s;ooner had he compleated this compo&s;ition, than he again experienced the munificence of the
<PB N="20" REF="22">
&s;overeign. In the &s;ame year he was made U&s;her of the Chamber, an office of great rank and honour; and in further &s;upport of his new dignity Philip added a &s;tipend of a daily ration of twelve rials and a yearly &s;uit or habit of ninety ducats value. In this year <HI>Rubens</HI> made his &s;e|cond vi&s;it to Madrid in quality of Amba&s;&s;ador; the intimacy, which he formed with <HI>Velazquez</HI> and the ideas he thereby in&s;pired into him of the &s;tate of the arts in Italy, rai&s;ed an irre&s;i&s;tible de&s;ire in that ambitious arti&s;t of pro&s;ecuting fur|ther improvements in the &s;tudy of the antique and in the &s;chools and collections in Rome. <HI>Velazquez</HI> was now in &s;uch favour, that he had no &s;ooner expre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;hes
<PB N="21" REF="23">
for a tour to Italy, than he found him&s;elf anticipated in every prepa|rative for his undertaking, that the indulgence of his Sovereign could provide. His Maje&s;ty gave him four hundred ducats and two years &s;alary to defray his expences, and Olivares upon parting added two hundred ducats more in gold and a medal with the head of the King and many recommendatory letters: He left Madrid in com|pany with Don Alon&s;o E&s;pinola, the King's general in Flanders, and embarked at Barcelona on the fea&s;t of San Lorenzo: In Augu&s;t 1629 he landed at Venice, and was lodged at the Spani&s;h amba&s;|&s;ador's hou&s;e, who &s;hewed him all po&s;&s;ible kindne&s;s and directed
<PB N="22" REF="24">
his &s;ervants to attend him, when|ever he went out. In Venice he copied a picture of Tintoreto's, but, not chu&s;ing to make any long abode there, he took his route to Rome, pa&s;&s;ing through Ferrara, where he was very honourably en|tertained by Cardinal Sacheti, who had been nuncio in Spain, with whom he pa&s;&s;ed two days: In Rome he was lodged in the Vati|can by favour of Cardinal Barbe|rino, who gave him acce&s;s at all times to the works of <HI>Rafael</HI> and <HI>Michael Angelo Bonarrota:</HI> Of the&s;e great authors he &s;tudied the mo&s;t capital productions with unremit|ting attention and delight; but his health being impaired by in|ten&s;e application, he was directed
<PB N="23" REF="25">
into a more airy part of the city, in the hou&s;e of the Florentine am|ba&s;&s;ador through the favour of the Conde de Monte Rey, Philip's amba&s;&s;ador at Rome: Being now convale&s;cent, he gave him&s;elf up to the &s;tudy of the antique for the &s;pace of two months. During his abode in Rome he painted his ce|lebrated hi&s;tory of Jacob, when his &s;ons &s;hew the bloody garment of Jo&s;eph, a picture, which in all the great requi&s;ites of perfection is &s;carcely to be exceeded and is un|doubtedly one of his mo&s;t capital performances; he al&s;o painted the Di&s;covery of Venus's In&s;idelity, as related by Apollo to Vulcan, who is repre&s;ented at his forge attended by his journeymen the
<PB N="24" REF="26">
Cyclops, a wonderful piece of ex|pre&s;&s;ion: Both the&s;e pictures he tran&s;mitted to King Philip, who ordered them to his palace of the Buen-Retiro, from whence that of Jo&s;eph was removed to the E&s;corial, where it now hangs, an illu&s;trious acce&s;&s;ion to that invaluable collec|tion.</P>
<P><HI>Velazquez,</HI> after a year and a half's ab&s;ence, returned to Ma|drid, taking Naples in his way, where he made a portrait of Donna Maria de Au&s;tria, Queen of Hun|gary, con&s;ort of Ferdinand the IIId: Ab&s;ence had not impaired his fa|vour with the King, who made him one of the gentlemen of his wardrobe and appointed him a painting-room in his palace, of
<PB N="25" REF="27">
which the King him&s;elf kept a private key; re&s;orting to him as Charles did to <HI>Titiano</HI> and Philip the IId to <HI>Coello: Fuit enim ea comi|tas illi, propter quam gratior Alex|andro magno erat, frequenter</HI> in <HI>offi|cinam ventitanti.</HI> (Plin. Nat. Hi&s;t. lib. 31. cap. 10.)</P>
<P>In 1638 <HI>Velazquez</HI> made a portrait of Don Franci&s;co IIId, Duque de Modena, who was then at Madrid, and in the &s;ame year he painted his famous crucifix now in the con|vent of the monks of San Placido at Madrid; and &s;urely, if there were nothing but this &s;ingle figure to immortalize the fame of <HI>Velaz|quez,</HI> this alone were &s;ufficient: It is of the &s;ize of life upon a plain back ground, di&s;po&s;ed with great
<PB N="26" REF="28">
&s;implicity and nature, but with an expre&s;&s;ion in the features, an air in the depre&s;&s;ion of the head and a harmonious tone of colouring, at once &s;o tender and of &s;uch effect, that nothing can exceed it. I vi&s;it|ed this exqui&s;ite production re|peatedly and every time with new delight and &s;urprize. The wretched cell or cabin, where it hangs, af|fords but little light thro' the iron grate of a window not glazed and that little is unfavourable: Mount Calvary it&s;elf was &s;carce more di&s;|mal. In the &s;ame year <HI>Velazquez</HI> fini&s;hed a portrait of Don Adrian Pulido Pare&s;a, Admiral of the King's fleet in New Spain: This officer was under orders for repair|ing to his command, when Philip,
<PB N="27" REF="29">
upon entering the chamber of <HI>Ve|lazquez</HI> then at work upon this por|trait, mi&s;taking it for the Admiral him&s;elf, entered into &s;udden ex|po&s;tulation with him for &s;taying at Madrid beyond his time; declaring to <HI>Velazquez,</HI> after di&s;covering his mi&s;take, that it was &s;o perfect a counterpart of the Admiral, that with no light in the room but what &s;truck immediately upon the fi|gure, he had for &s;ome time actually believed it to be the per&s;on him|&s;elf, and was &s;urprized at finding him there in di&s;obedience to his orders. In painting this picture <HI>Velazquez</HI> u&s;ed pencils with very long handles to produce more ef|fect by di&s;tance; this admirable
<PB N="28" REF="30">
portrait was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the late Duque de Arcos.</P>
<P>It may well be expected to find the performances of this period of <HI>Velazquez</HI>'s life executed in his be&s;t &s;tile, when his ta&s;te was form|ed by &s;tudy at Rome, his judg|ment matured by experience and his fire not yet abated by years; care&s;&s;ed by his &s;overeign, applaud|ed by his contemporaries and at the &s;ummit of all worldly pro&s;|perity. In 1643 the mini&s;ter Oli|vares was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his em|ployments and confined to his town of de Toro, where he died on the 22d of July 1645, and his body was permitted to be removed for interment by the barefooted Car|melites at Loeches in the convent
<PB N="29" REF="31">
of his own foundation. The good fortune of <HI>Velazquez</HI> received no &s;hock by the di&s;grace of his patron. It is to be mentioned to his honour upon this event, that he did not for&s;ake his benefactor in misfor|tune, but took occa&s;ion, notwith|&s;tanding his employ at court, to &s;ee Don Ga&s;par de Guzman in his exile and give him one, and per|haps the only, example of an un|&s;haken attachment; the healing con&s;olation, which &s;uch a vi&s;it mu&s;t bring with it to a mind gall|ed by ingratitude and langui&s;hing under the inquietudes of di&s;|appointed ambition, need not be pointed out: It is an amiable trait in Philip's character, that he &s;aw this attachment and &s;uffered it
<PB N="30" REF="32">
without withdrawing any portion of his favour from <HI>Velazquez;</HI> this I think is clear from his giving him this very year the honour of the gold key and taking him with him upon his &s;econd journey to Zarago|za: He had accompanied the King into Aragon the year before Oli|vares's di&s;grace, when Philip made his expedition for quieting the tu|mults in Catalun~a; this was re|peated in 1644 and now his favou|rite arti&s;t attended him as groom of the chamber, and upon the &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion of Lerida to Philip on the 31&s;t of July of that year, who en|tered it in per&s;on on the 7th of Augu&s;t following, <HI>Velazquez</HI> made a magnificent portrait of the King in the habit he then wore with all
<PB N="31" REF="33">
the in&s;ignia of a general, an ine&s;ti|mable work: He drew the Cardinal Infante Don Fernando, Philip's brother, the Queen Donna I&s;abel richly habited, mounted on a beau|tiful white palfrey, and the prince Don Carlos, very young, in armour with a general's &s;taff in his hand on a Spani&s;h jennet in full &s;peed: He made many other portraits of il|lu&s;trious per&s;ons, Don Franci&s;co de Quevedo Villegas, Cardinal de Borja y Vela&s;co, Archbi&s;hop of Seville and Toledo, the learned Simon de Roxas and others. He drew the King again on hor&s;eback in armour with his titles as follows, viz. <HI>Philippus Magn: hujus nom: IV, potenti&s;&s;imus Hi&s;paniarum Rex</HI>

<P>In the year 1648 <HI>Velazquez</HI> was di&s;patched upon a particular em|ba&s;&s;y to Pope Innocent X. and was at the &s;ame time commi&s;&s;ioned by the King to purcha&s;e &s;tatues and pictures in Italy for the royal collec|tion; on this expedition he &s;ate out from Madrid in the month of November and embarked at Ma|laga with Don Jayme Manuel de Cardenas, Duque de Naxera, who was going to Trent a e&s;perar a la Reyna Donna Maria An~a de Au&s;tria, daughter of the Emperor Ferdinan|do IIId and Donna Maria Infanta of Spain. <HI>Velazquez</HI> landed in Genoa, pa&s;&s;ed through Milan, Padua and from thence to Venice, where he
<PB N="33" REF="35">
pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in reviving his ac|quaintance with the admired com|po&s;itions of <HI>Titiano, Tintoreto, Paulo Verones</HI> and others; and here he had the good fortune to purcha&s;e &s;ome capital pictures, as likewi&s;e in Bo|logna, where he engaged <HI>Miguel Colona</HI> and <HI>Agu&s;tin Miteli</HI> to go into Spain to execute &s;ome paint|ings in fre&s;co for the King. He made &s;ome &s;tay in Florence and paid a vi&s;it to the Duke of Modena, who received him with great cor|diality and &s;howed him the por|trait he had painted at Madrid, &s;plendidly equipped and di&s;po&s;ed to all po&s;&s;ible advantage in the be&s;t apartment of the palace; from hence he went to Parma to view the works of the celebrated <HI>Cor|regio,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="36">
and whil&s;t he was on his way from Parma to Rome, he was called away to Naples by expre&s;s from the Viceroy Conde de On~ate, who had received the King's com|mands to confer with <HI>Velazquez</HI> upon the objects of his commi&s;|&s;ion; here he was vi&s;ited by the famous <HI>Ribera,</HI> a Knight of the order of Chri&s;t. When he arrived in Rome he was received with great kindne&s;s and di&s;tinction by the Pope, and as he found many hours, when the duties of his em|ploy did not engage his attention, he painted many portraits in Rome of dignified per&s;ons after the ex|ample of <HI>Rubens</HI> during his em|ba&s;&s;y at Madrid. Innocent X. &s;ate to <HI>Velazquez</HI> and, in token of
<PB N="35" REF="37">
his &s;atisfaction, gave him a mag|nificent golden medal. <HI>Velazquez</HI> &s;ent a copy of this picture over to Spain. He made a portrait of <HI>Juan de Parexa</HI> the painter, which being exhibited to the public on the fea&s;t of San Jo&s;eph, after the departure of <HI>Velazquez,</HI> it was &s;o univer&s;ally applauded, that the academicians of Rome elected him of their body and &s;ent his appoint|ment after him to Spain. It was not till the year 1651, that <HI>Velaz|quez</HI> took his departure by &s;ea from Genoa on his return to Spain, freighted with a very grand col|lection of antique &s;tatues, bu&s;ts and &s;ome pictures of the mo&s;t cele|brated ma&s;ters. He arrived in &s;afety with his cargo, and was re|ceived
<PB N="36" REF="38">
by Philip with his accu&s;|tomed favour. The Queen Donna I&s;abel de Bourbon had died whil&s;t <HI>Velazquez</HI> was ab&s;ent, and the King had wedded Donna Maria An~a de Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>In 1652, Philip be&s;towed upon <HI>Velazquez,</HI> a very di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of his favour by appointing him Apo&s;entador major of his royal palace in the room of Don Pedro de Torres, an office to be filled by none but men of eminent pre|ten&s;ions either in rank or &s;ervice, and after his return from Italy it appears, that Philip took him into ab&s;olute confidence, pa&s;&s;ing many hours in private with him and ad|vi&s;ing with him upon affairs of the greate&s;t delicacy and importance.
<PB N="37" REF="39">
It was at this time <HI>Velazquez</HI> de|&s;igned and executed his famous picture, in which he has repre|&s;ented him&s;elf at his ea&s;el with his pallet in one hand and his pencil in the other; the picture, on which he is working, is the portrait of Donna Margarita Maria of Au&s;tria, Infanta of Spain, and afterwards Empre&s;s of Germany. It is re|lated of this picture, that Philip with his own hand put in the order of Santiago upon the portrait of <HI>Velazquez,</HI> which at the time of painting this piece (viz. 1656) he was not yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. When Charles the IId of Spain &s;hewed this picture to <HI>Lucas Jordan,</HI> he exclaimed with rapture and &s;ur|prize,
<PB N="38" REF="40">
<HI>Sen~or e&s;ta es la Theologia de la Pintura.</HI></P>
<P>This year 1656 <HI>Velazquez</HI> re|ceived an order from the King to &s;elect a number of original pic|tures to augment the collection at the E&s;corial: They were taken out of tho&s;e, which he him&s;elf had purcha&s;ed for the King in Italy, with others, that had been col|lected in Naples by the Viceroy Conde de Ca&s;trillo, and the pic|tures, which had been bought in England at the &s;ale of the late Royal Martyr's effects: Among&s;t the&s;e latter it is well known was the ine&s;timable <HI>Perla</HI> of <HI>Rafael,</HI> an Holy Family by <HI>Andrea del Sarto</HI> and a capital piece by <HI>Tintoret</HI> of our Saviour wa&s;hing his Di&s;ciples

The extrac|tion of &s;uch ine&s;timable pieces of art out of any country may well be termed a national lo&s;s and misfor|tune, and, viewing it as &s;uch, we ju&s;tly execrate the ta&s;tele&s;s dema|gogues, that put them up to pub|lic &s;ale; but this once done, we certainly have cau&s;e for &s;elf-con|gratulation
<PB N="40" REF="42">
and &s;urprize, that any of the valuable reliques of that collection are left among&s;t us; how it came to pa&s;s that the cartoons of Rafael were bought in by the Protector, when Philip's amba&s;&s;a|dor was a bidder, one is at a lo&s;s to account; and it mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered as a very happy chance, that they did not expatriate together with the Perla and its compani|ons: Add to this, that at an aera when it was religion to break painted windows, it might have been meritorious to burn painted canva&s;s; &s;o that it is well their &s;entence was not death, in&s;tead of bani&s;hment.</P>

<P><HI>Velazquez</HI> in obedience to his orders removed forty-one capital pictures to the E&s;corial, col|lected by Philip, of all which he pre&s;ented to the King a full and critical de&s;cription and account.

<P><HI>Colona,</HI> after concluding his commi&s;&s;ion much to the &s;atisfaction of the King and his own emolu|ment, returned to Italy in Septem|ber 1662, though others have &s;up|po&s;ed, that he went to France.</P>
<P>In 1659 <HI>Velazquez</HI> by order of the King painted a portrait of Don Phelipe Prince of A&s;turias born 1651, which was &s;ent into Germany to the Emperor. He al&s;o painted one of the Infanta Donna Margarita de Au&s;tria, an excellent piece, which portraits were the la&s;t works, that this il|lu&s;trious arti&s;t lived to fini&s;h. In the year preceding this Philip had conferred upon <HI>Velazquez</HI> the mi|litary
<PB N="46" REF="48">
order of Santiago; the King was then at the E&s;corial and, hav|ing according to the rules of the order i&s;&s;ued his mandate to the Marquis de Tabara the pre&s;ident to examine and report the proofs of qualification on the part of <HI>Ve|lazquez,</HI> which being complied with and pre&s;ented to the King, Philip turning him&s;elf to <HI>Velaz|quez</HI> with a &s;mile, that expre&s;t every thing mo&s;t gracious and complacent, replied, <HI>Give him the order, for I know his noble birth and the right he has to it;</HI> and thus at once made needle&s;s any further &s;crutiny and examination. As a further grace to this di&s;tingui&s;hed arti&s;t, Philip appointed his inve&s;|titure for the fea&s;t of San Pro&s;pero,
<PB N="47" REF="49">
which was the day of the Prince of A&s;turias, who bore that among&s;t his names; and thus upon the grand gala of the court, amid&s;t the utmo&s;t fe&s;tivity and magni|ficence, <HI>Velazquez</HI> was inve&s;ted with the in&s;ignia of the order by the hands of Sen~or Don Ga&s;par Juan Alon&s;o Perez de Guzman, then Conde de Niebla and after|wards Duque de Medina Sidonia; his &s;pon&s;or on the &s;olemnity being the Marquis de Malpica, Comen|dador of the order. The functions of his office of Apo&s;entador now occupied the chief part of <HI>Velaz|quez</HI>'s time, who, full of fame and years, began to obey the &s;ummons of old age and abate of his wonted application to his art.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50">
The King now prepared for his journey to Irun to meet the King of France, who by his amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary had demanded the Infanta Donna Maria Tere&s;a in mar|riage; this journey took place in 1660, and <HI>Velazquez</HI> in execution of his office &s;ate out before the court; the King followed with the Infanta; they pa&s;&s;ed through Al|cala, Guadalaxara and Burgos, in which capital <HI>Velazquez</HI> waited to receive the further orders of his &s;overeign for fitting and preparing the ceremonials of the interview: The hou&s;e appointed for this pur|po&s;e was in the I&s;le de los fay&s;anes upon the river Vida&s;as near to Irun in the province of Guepuzcoa. <HI>Velazquez</HI> advanced to this place in
<PB N="49" REF="51">
company with the Baron de Bate|billa, Governor of San Seba&s;tian, for the purpo&s;e of putting it in pro|per order and condition for the re|ception of the royal per&s;onages, who were there to meet; this in|terview took place in the month of June, when Louis the fourteenth, after being &s;plendidly regaled and having interchanged &s;everal mag|nificent pre&s;ents with the Catholic King, received his bride and Philip returned to San Seba&s;tian. In all the&s;e &s;plendid ceremonials <HI>Velazquez</HI> officiated in quality of his po&s;t, adorned with the in&s;ignia of his knighthood and other dig|nities, magnificently apparelled in a ve&s;t of golilla with rich &s;ilver lace of Milan, according to the fa&s;hion

<P>The King returned through Guadarrama and the E&s;corial to Madrid, and <HI>Velazquez</HI> at the &s;um|mit of all worldly happine&s;s and pro&s;perity ha&s;tened to enjoy the congratulations and embraces of his family.

his hou&s;hold, on account of his death being predicted to them by &s;everal of the court. <HI>Velazquez</HI> was too con&s;iderable a man to fall without &s;ome traditional pre&s;ages of his death; this is a tribute, which the &s;uper&s;tition of the time generally demands and, if chance does not furni&s;h the fact, invention mu&s;t &s;upply it and biographers mu&s;t record it: On the eve of San Ignacio, at the end of the month of July in 1660, <HI>Velazquez,</HI> hav|ing attended his functions at court, complained of being unu&s;ually fa|tigued and &s;ickened that night; his family phy&s;ician Don Vicencio Moles was immediately called in; the alarm of his illne&s;s &s;oon reach|ed the King; the royal phy&s;icians
<PB N="52" REF="54">
Don Miguel de Alva and Don Pe|dro de Chavarri were &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and the fever, (as well may be be|lieved) kept pace with their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. The King, after &s;o many &s;plendid favours be&s;towed upon <HI>Velazquez</HI> through the cour&s;e of his reign, added the la&s;t melancholy office of friend&s;hip by &s;ending to him a &s;piritual comforter in the per&s;on of Don Alon&s;o Perez de Guzman, a good and pious prelate, Archbi&s;hop of Tyre in partibus in|fidelium and Patriarch of the In|dies: He &s;upported him&s;elf again&s;t the violence of his di&s;temper and the medicines of his doctors till the evening of the 6th of Augu&s;t, when this great arti&s;t, at the age of 66, having compleated a life of
<PB N="53" REF="55">
uninterrupted felicity and fame, re|&s;igned it with becoming fortitude and compo&s;ure; lamented by his Sovereign, and regretted by all but tho&s;e, who envied his talents and pro&s;perity. Philip who naturally was a lover of the arts, under the tuition of <HI>Velazquez</HI> had become a judge; the hours, which he had dedicated to the &s;ociety of this elegant and grateful in&s;tructor, were the mo&s;t &s;erene and plea&s;ing pa&s;&s;ages of his life: His attach|ment to <HI>Velazquez</HI> had been cau&s;ed by admiration of his talents, but it was clo&s;ed and confirmed by experience of his di&s;cretion, fide|lity and virtue: This attachment had been now coeval with his reign; it had felt no interruption
<PB N="54" REF="56">
or abatement, had outla&s;ted all tho&s;e political ones, to which for a time he had &s;o ab&s;olutely &s;ur|rendered him&s;elf: In the revul&s;ion of his affection from his favourite Olivares, a &s;hock which might na|turally be thought deci&s;ive again&s;t <HI>Velazquez,</HI> Philip had the mode|ration to admit of &s;haring his at|tentions with a mini&s;ter, whom he had di&s;carded; a &s;elf-&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion difficult for any man, but doubly &s;o for one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of arbitrary power; the grateful va&s;&s;al felt his Sovereign's magnanimity and knew the value of the &s;acrifice; from that period his devotion was un|bounded, and Philip's confidence kept pace with it &s;o effectually, in &s;pite of all the peevi&s;h efforts of
<PB N="55" REF="57">
the envious, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his favour undimini&s;hed to the la&s;t hour of life: That event deprived the King of a re&s;ource and made a gap in his enjoyments, which he could never more fill up; the lo&s;s to Philip was irreparable, and no|thing now remained but to pay the la&s;t honours to the memory of <HI>Velazquez</HI> with a &s;olemnity, that &s;hould at once mark the love he bore his per&s;on and the e&s;teem he entertained for his merits: This was effectually performed and <HI>Ve|lazquez</HI> was attended to his grave in the parochial church of San Juan, by a train of courtiers and Grandees, with the band of the Royal chapels and all the funeral ceremonies of the mo&s;t &s;plendid

&s;uch being the frail materials, of which men of tender feelings, and more e&s;pecially profe&s;&s;ors of the fine arts, are too apt by nature to be compounded, we ought to re|gard their infirmity with compa&s;|&s;ion and be cautious how we at|tempt to derogate from that ex|cu&s;eable &s;elf-opinion, which is &s;o in&s;eparable from talents and &s;o e&s;|&s;ential to man's happine&s;s: In this view of the ca&s;e perhaps that &s;pecies of detraction, which a court of law will not denominate a libel, in a court of con&s;cience and in the eye of Heaven &s;hall amount to mur|der.

<P>The genius of <HI>Velazquez</HI> was of that quality, that to be within the

&s;phere of its activity was in &s;ome degree to partake of its enthu&s;ia&s;m, at lea&s;t where its attraction met with any particles that were of corre&s;pondent quality. A &s;lave, by name <HI>Juan de Pare&s;a,</HI> a Mu|latto, was employed in mixing his colours and feeding his pallet; from pointing the arrows of Apollo he became ambitious of trying his &s;trength at the bow: The di&s;qua|lification of his condition neverthe|le&s;s was &s;uch, that to touch the mo&s;t liberal of arts with the hand of a &s;lave was danger in the ex|treme: The Ca&s;ts in India do not &s;tand off at greater di&s;tance from each other, than degrees of men do in Spain, and <HI>Velazquez</HI> was of all ma&s;ters the lea&s;t likely to brook

a violation &s;o pre&s;umptuous as that which <HI>Pare&s;a</HI> meditated: Hung round with chains of gold and courtly orders, of haughty preten&s;ions in point of family and high in favour and familiarity with his Sovereign, <HI>Velazquez</HI> would have treated the in&s;olence of his &s;lave, as Jupiter did that of Salmo|neus, by extingui&s;hing his exi&s;t|ence: Notwith&s;tanding the temp|tation was for ever pre&s;ent and the impul&s;es of genius in the end be|came irre&s;i&s;tible; in the &s;tolen moments of his ma&s;ter's &s;ie&s;ta, or when court avocations called him from home, <HI>Pare&s;a</HI> &s;eized the clan|de&s;tine opportunities and by the force of talents became in time an accompli&s;hed arti&s;t.

in&s;pired him with higher projects, and as the liberality of Philip held out a general a&s;ylum to merit, he determined upon a method of in|troducing his performances to the eye of the King: He ob&s;erved it was his practice in <HI>Velazquez</HI>'s chamber to order the pictures, that &s;tood with their faces to the wall, to be turned that he might &s;ee them; this &s;ugge&s;ted to him the thought of &s;ub&s;tituting one of his own productions, and taking his chance for what &s;hould follow.

of a &s;lave and a Mulatto, but &s;uch an one in point of excellence, as would have done honour to a freer and a fairer arti&s;t: It was not ea&s;y to appeal to better judgment than the King's, or enter upon his trial at a more merciful tribunal: <HI>Pa|re&s;a</HI> fell upon his knees, and avow|ing the guilt of the performance, implored protection again&s;t the re|&s;entment of his ma&s;ter for having &s;ecretly purloined his art. <HI>Velaz|quez,</HI> &s;ays the King, you mu&s;t not only overlook this tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion in <HI>Pare&s;a,</HI> but ob&s;erve that &s;uch ta|lents &s;hould emancipate the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or.

<HI>Alon&s;o</HI> was not to be limited to one department in the arts or &s;ci|ences; he had indu&s;try to combat any difficulties, ardour to under|take and readine&s;s to apprehend.

the &s;ame time gave &s;ome &s;pecimens of his excellence in &s;tatuary, which were perfectly a&s;toni&s;hing in &s;o early a proficient; being then only twenty-four years of age. <HI>Cano</HI> was of a noble family and &s;o high|minded that in his early practice he would not admit of being paid for his productions, excu&s;ing him|&s;elf by declaring that he worked for reputation and practice, and that he con&s;idered him&s;elf as yet &s;o unfini&s;hed and imperfect in his art, that he could not in con&s;cience ad|mit of any recompence: Never|thele&s;s in this early period of life he exhibited &s;ome &s;tatues of &s;uch &s;uperior workman&s;hip, in particu|lar a Madonna and Child, now in the great church of Nebriga, and

<HI>Cano</HI> attached him&s;elf to the &s;uite of the Conde Duque, and under his protection came to Madrid; an arti&s;t of his exten|&s;ive capacity was not likely to be overlooked by Philip, and in a &s;hort time he was made Fir&s;t Royal Architect, King's Painter, and Teacher to the Prince Don Bal|thazar Carlos de Au&s;tria.

The cri|minal judges held a court of en|quiry upon the fact, and having di&s;covered that <HI>Alon&s;o Cano</HI> had been jealous of this Italian, and al&s;o that he was known to be at|tached to another woman, they ac|quitted the &s;ugitive gallant and

with a &s;agacity truly in character condemned the hu&s;band; no choice was now left to <HI>Cano</HI> but to fly and abandon Madrid in the mid&s;t of his pro&s;perity; he cau&s;ed it to be reported that he was gone to Por|tugal and took refuge in the city of Valencia; nece&s;&s;ity &s;oon com|pelled him to have recour&s;e to his art, and his art immediately be|trayed him; in this exigency he betook him&s;elf to the a&s;ylum of a Carthu&s;ian convent at Porta Coeli about three leagues from Valencia: Here he &s;eemed for a time deter|mined upon taking the order, but either the au&s;terities of that habit, or &s;ome hopes of returning with impunity to a cour&s;e of life more to his ta&s;te than a convent, put

him by from his de&s;ign, and he was even ra&s;h enough to return to Madrid, thinking to conceal him|&s;elf in the hou&s;e of his father Don Rafael Sanguineto. He made &s;e|veral paintings here as well as with the Carthu&s;ians, and not being of a temper to maintain any la&s;ting re&s;traint over him&s;elf, he neglected to keep hou&s;e with Don Rafael, and was apprehended in the &s;treets, and directions were given for put|ting him to the torture: <HI>Cano</HI> de|fended him&s;elf by the plea of <HI>ex|cellens in arte,</HI> and he obtained &s;o much mitigation as to have his right arm exempted from the liga|ture; he &s;uffered the rack, and had the re&s;olution under his tor|tures not to criminate him&s;elf by

any confe&s;&s;ion, not uttering a &s;ingle word. This circum&s;tance being related to Philip, he received him again into favour, and as <HI>Cano</HI> &s;aw there was no ab&s;olute &s;afety but within the pale of the Church, he &s;olicited the King with that view and was named Re&s;identiary of Grenada: The Chapter objected to his nomination, and deputed two of their body to repre&s;ent to Philip again&s;t the per&s;on of <HI>Cano,</HI> enumerating many di&s;qualifications and among&s;t the re&s;t want of learning: The King di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Deputies bidding them proceed to admit his nomination, and tel|ling them that if <HI>Cano</HI> had been a man of learning, he &s;hould per|haps have made him their Bi&s;hop

hou&s;e with the utmo&s;t precipita|tion, concluding that the man, who was bold enough to demoli&s;h a Saint, would have very little re|mor&s;e in de&s;troying a Lawyer.

<PB N="85" REF="87">
1658; from this period to his death he led an exempiary life of great charity and devotion; when he had no money to be&s;tow in alms, which was frequently the ca&s;e, he would call for paper and give a beggar a drawing, directing him where to carry it for &s;ale; but to Jews he bore &s;uch antipathy that he con&s;idered every touch of theirs as a contamination, and in &s;uch ca&s;es would give away his cloaths, forbidding however his &s;ervant on whom he be&s;towed them, on any account to wear what he had ca&s;t off. On his death-bed he would not receive the &s;acraments from a prie&s;t, who attended him, becau&s;e he had given them to the converted Jews; and from another

fine arts, I am inclined to think his talents would have produced a di&s;|play &s;uperior to any Spain had gi|ven birth to; in the early period of his life, when the great arti&s;ts of Flanders thought a journey to Spain well repaid by &s;urveying and copying his works, and when he had &s;o &s;trong an idea in his mind of further excellence, that he re|fu&s;ed payment for productions he regarded as imperfect, he could have given no greater evidence of the true &s;pirit and native genius of an arti&s;t; the &s;ame &s;pirit at|tended him to his la&s;t hour, the very eye that the hand of death was in the act of clo&s;ing, and in which the light of life was all but ab&s;olutely extinct, revolted with

abhorrence from a di&s;proportioned and ill-carved crucifix, though to that object the indi&s;pen&s;able duties of his religion were affixed.

that abu&s;e of ju&s;tice, which u&s;urps its name, and which at pre|&s;ent obtains in the afflicted and truly pitiable kingdom, where this account has chiefly been com|po&s;ed, participates much of the nature of inqui&s;itorial proceedings, and I am in this place tempted to relate a fact, of which I was a very intere&s;ted and anxious &s;pectator, that will confirm what I have ad|vanced. I had in my family at Madrid a young man of exemplary character, who lived with me in great tru&s;t and intimacy, and was a native of that city, univer&s;ally known and re&s;pected in it; he had been my gue&s;t but one night, when the next day at the hour of dinner the officers of ju&s;tice en|tered

my chamber, whil&s;t a party of &s;oldiers paraded at my gates, demanding the body of this unfor|tunate victim; it was as vain to a&s;k to know the charge, as it was impracticable to avoid or re&s;i&s;t it; after conditioning for the removal of the &s;oldiers, and &s;ome promi&s;es of humanity on the part of the judge, I &s;urrendered to that ma|gi&s;trate a young man, born of Iri&s;h parents, red-haired, of a fair com|plexion, and without impediment in his gait or per&s;on. I mention the&s;e circum&s;tances becau&s;e this officer and his alguazils were in &s;earch of his direct oppo&s;ite in every particular, viz. of an old felon, an A&s;turian, black as a gyp|&s;ey and lame in one of his feet by
<PB N="92" REF="94">
a natural defect in its formation. In &s;pite of the evidence of his own eyes, the judge conducted my gue&s;t to pri&s;on, hand-cuffed and hauled between two fiend-like al|guazils, in the &s;ight of hundreds of &s;pectators, who followed him through the &s;treets &s;ilently com|pa&s;&s;ionating his ignominy and mi&s;|fortune. The next day his books, papers and effects were &s;eized and rummaged, where fortunately they found no food for the Holy Office, nor offence again&s;t the &s;tate. In the regular cour&s;e of proceeding he &s;hould have laid in pri&s;on ten or twelve years, if nature could have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for that time, before he was allowed to &s;ee his judge; but at my in&s;tance he was &s;peedily
<PB N="93" REF="95">
admitted to an examination, and I place it ju&s;tly among&s;t the many marks of kindne&s;s I was di&s;tingui&s;h|ed with in that kingdom, that ju&s;tice was made &s;o to quicken her cu&s;to|mary pace on my account. When he was brought before the judge, though every feature in his face &s;wore to the mi&s;take of his com|mitment, the nece&s;&s;ary forms of inqui&s;ition were not to be pa&s;&s;ed over and he was called upon to re|collect all the pa&s;&s;ages of his life and conver&s;ation, and to gue&s;s the cau&s;e for which he was arre&s;ted and impri&s;oned: In perfect &s;im|plicity of heart he expo&s;ed to his inqui&s;itor all his hi&s;tory and habits of life with the whole of his cor|re&s;pondence and acquaintance, as
<PB N="94" REF="96">
well as a di&s;turbed imagination could bring it to recollection: When this had pa&s;&s;ed and happily nothing had dropt on which his judge could fa&s;ten any new matter of crimination, he was coolly in|formed he did not an&s;wer to the de&s;cription of the felon they were in &s;earch of, and that he was at li|berty to return to the place from which he came.</P>

lived in his family with the greate&s;t intimacy and friend&s;hip till the time of the admiral's exile; upon that event the di&s;con&s;olate <HI>Alfaro</HI> could no longer &s;upport a re&s;i|dence in Madrid and retired to Cordova his native city in 1678; here he lived in great privacy and ob&s;curity, and an edict having been publi&s;hed for taxing pictures ad valorem, <HI>Alfaro</HI> then &s;ore with the lo&s;s and misfortunes of his friend, and indignant again&s;t a principle &s;o di&s;couraging to the arts, totally ab&s;tained from paint|ing, though his fame was at its height and his age not yet forty: Under this &s;pirited &s;elf-denial he was &s;uffering infinite di&s;tre&s;&s;es, when information was brought of

the relea&s;ement of his friend: To hear the&s;e glad tidings and to &s;et out upon his journey of congratu|lation to Madrid was in <HI>Alfaro</HI> the operation of one and the &s;ame moment: His provi&s;ion for the way was no impediment to his di&s;|patch, and perhaps at that in&s;tant the concern never entered his mind; though the journey was long and the country difficult, yet the impul&s;e of an ardent affection &s;moothed all ob&s;tacles; if <HI>Alfaro</HI> was de&s;titute, yet he might pre|&s;ume upon encountering ho&s;pita|lity by the way, and if all other doors were &s;hut again&s;t his nece&s;|&s;ities the doors of convents are ever open to the wayfaring man and the poor.

<P>I come now to &s;peak of the ten|der and natural <HI>Murillo,</HI> a painter better known in England than any of the Spani&s;h &s;chool except <HI>Ri|bera,</HI> and yet I very much doubt whether any hi&s;torical groupe or compo&s;ition of <HI>Murillo</HI>'s is in En|gli&s;h hands; at lea&s;t my enquiry has not a&s;certained any &s;uch to be &s;ound: It is of cour&s;e a very im|perfect mea&s;ure of his merit we can take in this country: The great Hi&s;torical Paintings of the Life of Jacob in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Marquis de Santiago at Ma|drid are the fine&s;t compo&s;itions

of whom we have frequently &s;poken, was his uncle by the mo|ther's &s;ide, and in his academy at Seville he received his fir&s;t in&s;truc|tions: How long he &s;tudied under this ma&s;ter I cannot determine, but I take for granted not to the time of <HI>Ca&s;tillo</HI>'s death, for he mu&s;t have been thirty-&s;even years of age at that period. His fir&s;t manner was rather black and inky, and indeed the colouring of <HI>Ca&s;tillo</HI> afforded no good example to his di&s;ciples; in all other re|qui&s;ites he was competent to the profe&s;&s;ion of a teacher. It was then the cu&s;tom for the young no|vitiates to expo&s;e their productions at the fair, held annually in the city of Seville; many of <HI>Murillo</HI>'s

fir&s;t pictures were purcha&s;ed in this manner, and &s;o many were bought up and exported to the We&s;t India colonies, that it has given ri&s;e to a fal&s;e tradition of his having gone thither in per&s;on. <HI>Velazquez</HI> was painting at the height of his repu|tation in Madrid, when <HI>Murillo</HI> conceived the ambition of vi&s;iting that capital and introducing him|&s;elf to the notice of that eminent profe&s;&s;or. <HI>Velazquez</HI> was of too liberal a genius, and withal too intuitive in his art, to reject the advances of a man of talents and a countryman: He admitted young <HI>Murillo</HI> into his academy, and a new &s;cene in&s;tantly pre&s;ented it&s;elf to his view: Here he had acce&s;s to every thing which the Royal

an engraving was made in Flanders by <HI>Nicholas Amazurino. Murillo</HI> was in his per&s;on graceful, of a mild and humble deportment and an expre&s;&s;ive hand&s;ome counte|nance; to the allurements of in|tere&s;t or ambition he was equally in&s;en&s;ible; he re&s;i&s;ted, as we have &s;een, the offers of Charles, and at his death was found po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one hundred rials, which he had received the day before, and &s;ixty dollars in a drawer: He was in his &s;eventy-third year, when mount|ing a &s;caffold to make a painting of Saint Catherine for the convent of Capuchins at Cadiz, he fell, and, having already a rupture, brui&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o as to bring on a violent increa&s;e of his di&s;order;

but &s;uch was the delicacy of his nature, that being unwilling to expo&s;e his infirmity to the exami|nation of a &s;urgeon, he &s;uffered in &s;ilence, and after &s;ome days an|gui&s;h a mortification taking place, with perfect compo&s;ure he re&s;igned a life, tinged with no other exce&s;s, but that of an inherent mode&s;ty, to which, having repeatedly &s;a|crificed what is generally e&s;teemed mo&s;t valuable in life, he la&s;tly gave up life it&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Claudio Coello,</HI> of a re&s;pectable Portugue&s;e family, was a native of Spain, born in Madrid in the &s;e|venteenth century, but in what preci&s;e year I have not been able to a&s;certain; he was a relation of the famous painter <HI>Alon&s;o Sanchez</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="135">
<HI>Coello,</HI> of whom we have already &s;poken. His father <HI>Fau&s;tino Coello</HI> was of the city of Tulbu&s;ino in the bi&s;hoprick of Vi&s;co in Portugal. He was educated in the academy of the famous <HI>Franci&s;co Ricci</HI> pain|ter to King Philip III. and was his favourite di&s;ciple; giving early and repeated proofs of an extraor|dinary genius he compleated his &s;tudies under the tuition of this great ma&s;ter, by who&s;e means he had acce&s;s to the royal collection, and copied many works of <HI>Titian, Rubens, Vandyke</HI> and others.</P>
<P>As <HI>Coello</HI> never travelled out of Spain and as few if any of his pic|tures are in private hands, there is little probability of any of his works being extracted from the

ob&s;curity in which they are im|mured; and I que&s;tion if his name has yet found its way beyond the confines of Spain or Portugal; as he was a native of Madrid and re|&s;ided there con&s;tantly, except when he was employed in the E&s;corial as a Royal Arti&s;t, many monu|ments of his genius are to be found in the convents and churches of that capital; the&s;e I have traced with an a&s;&s;iduity that has been richly repaid; for though I have had continual occa&s;ion to regret the di&s;advantageous po&s;ition of his pictures in tho&s;e gloomy repo&s;ita|ries, yet with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a mo&s;t brilliant climate and the kind offices of the Fathers whom I have ever found &s;tudious to a&s;&s;i&s;t
<PB N="133" REF="137">
my curio&s;ity, I have &s;een very excellent productions of his pencil; and though I cannot ab&s;olutely clo&s;e with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;ome of his living admirers who &s;et <HI>Coello</HI> decidedly at the head of the Spani&s;h &s;chool, preferring him to <HI>Murillo, Ribera</HI> and even <HI>Velaz|quez,</HI> yet there can be no doubt but he is to be ranked in the cla&s;s of the fir&s;t, though perhaps not the fir&s;t of the cla&s;s. His ca|pital picture <HI>de la Colocazion de las Santas Formas,</HI> on which he expended &s;even years labour, is an amazing compo&s;ition, and de|&s;ervedly maintains its rank at the altar of the grand &s;acri&s;ty of Saint Lorenzo in the E&s;corial, though in company with the productions
<PB N="134" REF="138">
of <HI>Raphael, Titiano</HI> and the great|e&s;t Italian and Flemi&s;h ma&s;ters. I do not remember ever to have &s;een &s;uch a &s;triking effect of clear|ob&s;cure and force of per&s;pective. In the groupe of per&s;ons who form the grand proce&s;&s;ion of the collo|cation there are to be &s;ound the portraits of the King and all the principal nobility of his court, executed to the life it&s;elf; every thing is traced with the mo&s;t ma&s;|terly and determined pencil. Such a maje&s;tic and orderly &s;olemnity is ob&s;erved in the arrangement of his figures, as be&s;peaks the art of the compo&s;er, and &s;uits the dignity of his &s;ubject; all the accompani|ments are in &s;uch perfect harmony and the colouring of the parts &s;o
<PB N="135" REF="139">
rich and glowing with &s;uch forcible but clear relief, that it forms the mo&s;t ravi&s;hing &s;pectacle, that art can form, nor is it ea&s;y to call off the attention to the other great productions that enrich this in|e&s;timable repo&s;itary, till the eye is in &s;ome degree &s;atisfied with this &s;triking canva&s;s.</P>
<P>As this picture is undoubtedly the chef d'oeuvre of <HI>Coello,</HI> it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to enter upon a mi|nute enumeration of his works in the churches and convents of Ma|drid, Toledo and Zarago&s;&s;a; it will &s;uffice to ob&s;erve that there is a Nativity by this ma&s;ter in the royal collection at Madrid, which hangs in the &s;ame room with the Adoration of <HI>Rubens</HI> and is a pic|ture
<PB N="136" REF="140">
of very high preten&s;ions tho' in &s;uch a neighbourhood. In the chapel of the nuns of Saint Pla|cido there is a large altar-piece of <HI>Coello</HI>'s painting on the &s;ubject of the Incarnation; the Holy Vir|gin is di&s;played in the center of the piece, above is a glory of Angels, and in the fore-ground a groupe of Prophets and Sybils who announce the coming of the Me&s;|&s;ias. This was the fir&s;t compo&s;i|tion of <HI>Coello,</HI> and was executed by him whil&s;t in the &s;chool of <HI>Franci&s;co Ricci.</HI> It is a piece in high e&s;timation, but the unfavour|able light in which it is placed and its great height from the eye, (the figures being only of the natural &s;ize) &s;carce allow the &s;pectator to
<PB N="137" REF="141">
form any judgement of its excel|lence. In the &s;ame altar-piece, and in various parts of the &s;ame cha|pel there are many &s;maller paint|ings of <HI>Coello</HI> and &s;ome &s;light &s;ketches in the pannels of the al|tars of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit: But of all the remains of this ma&s;ter tho&s;e which in my opinion de&s;erve to be ranked next to his altar-piece in the E&s;corial abovementioned are two pictures upon canva&s;s in the valuable collection of the Carme|liti&s;h convent in the great &s;treet of Alcala; but the&s;e again are in &s;uch lights, or more properly in &s;uch want of light, that our gratifica|tion &s;carce balances our regret. On the whole it appears to me that if <HI>Coello</HI>'s works could be
<PB N="138" REF="142">
reprieved from their impri&s;onment, and were favourably di&s;po&s;ed a|mong&s;t the great collections of Europe they would hold a very di&s;tingui&s;hed rank, wherever they were placed; of all the ma&s;ters of e&s;tabli&s;hed name and character I am of opinion he mo&s;t re&s;embles <HI>Paulo Verone&s;e;</HI> his draperies, colours and characters are mo&s;tly of that ca&s;t and his compo&s;itions fully on a level: In the nude I have &s;een no &s;pecimens and I am inclined to believe there are few if any to be found. In the pic|tures belonging to the Carmelites, which refer to the legends of two Saints, of which I have lo&s;t the remembrance, he is as natural and &s;imple as <HI>Murillo,</HI> but with &s;ome|what

<P>Upon the death of <HI>Francis de Herrera,</HI> King Philip the IVth promoted <HI>Coello</HI> to be one of his painters at the in&s;tigation of <HI>Car|ren~o,</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="144">
and it was not till after the death of <HI>Carren~o,</HI> as well as of <HI>Franci&s;co Rici</HI> that <HI>Coello</HI> begun to paint his famous picture of the Collocation; when he had com|pleated that work he returned to Madrid in the year 1689, liberally rewarded. In a &s;hort time <HI>Luca Jordano</HI> was invited into Spain by King Charles the IId to paint the fre&s;co of the great &s;tairca&s;e at the E&s;corial and for other works. His arrival, which took place in 1692, was &s;o deeply re&s;ented by <HI>Coello,</HI> that he totally declined any other undertaking, except putting the la&s;t hand to his great picture of Saint Stephen for the church of that Saint in Salamanca, which having fini&s;hed, he exhibited it in
<PB N="141" REF="145">
the gallery of the grandees at the Pardo to the admiration of the whole court and no le&s;s &s;o of <HI>Jor|dano</HI> him&s;elf. The re&s;entful &s;pirit of <HI>Coello</HI> notwith&s;tanding this te&s;timo|ny could never be induced to brook the interpo&s;ition of a rival, and af|ter venting him&s;elf in many bitter &s;atires and invectives again&s;t <HI>Jor|dano,</HI> to which he was naturally too much addicted, he &s;ickened and &s;oon after died in 1693, to the general regret of all who admired his many great and eminent talents; with this melancholy aggravation to the regret which his death univer&s;ally occa&s;ioned, that it was owing to the effects of envy and chagrin ope|rating on a mo&s;t implacable tem|per,
<PB N="142" REF="146">
which all his eminent talents could not conquer or correct.</P>
<P><HI>Don Juan Nin~o de Guevara,</HI> born in Madrid, was a &s;on of the cap|tain of the guards of the Vice-king of Arragon, under who&s;e protec|tion he was put to &s;tudy painting under <HI>Don Miguel de Manrique</HI> a &s;cholar of <HI>Rubens.</HI> He afterwards removed to Madrid and became a &s;cholar of <HI>Alon&s;o Cano</HI>'s, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have excelled his ma&s;|ter. He re&s;ided chiefly at Malaga where he married a lady of noble birth. In this city he died in his &s;ixty-&s;eventh year, 1698.</P>
<P><HI>Luca Jordano</HI>'s works in Spain are both numerous and con&s;ider|able: He arrived at Madrid in May 1692 by the invitation of Charles
<PB N="143" REF="147">
the IId, who appointed a very li|beral allowance for his journey giving him the &s;teel key on his arrival, though he was now in his &s;ixty-fourth year. He has no where left greater proofs of that di&s;patch in his art, for which he &s;tands re|markable to a proverb; in the &s;pace of two years he covered an im|men&s;e compa&s;s of cieling with fre&s;co in the church and &s;tairca&s;e of the E&s;corial. Of all his fre&s;cos that of the &s;tairca&s;e repre&s;enting the famous battle of Saint Quin|tin and the taking of Montmo|renci is in the highe&s;t e&s;timation. It certainly forms a magnificent di&s;play of colour and de&s;ign, tho' neither the lights nor the archi|tecture &s;et it off with any advan|tage;
<PB N="144" REF="148">
the &s;tairca&s;e is not uncom|monly &s;pacious and of it&s;elf offers nothing to the eye, but a melan|choly ma&s;s of &s;tone-work of the dulle&s;t hue, unrelieved by any or|der or ornament what&s;oever. He remained in Spain till the death of Charles the IId and accompanied King Philip to Naples in the year 1702; in that period he executed a number of compo&s;itions in vari|ous manners and with various de|grees of merit at Madrid, the E&s;|corial and at Toledo: His fre&s;cos in the Buen Retiro are well pre|&s;erved although that palace is quite di&s;mantled, and are very repu|table productions. His facility in a&s;&s;uming the &s;tiles of different ma&s;ters is well known, and Charles
<PB N="145" REF="149">
the IId never put his talents to better u&s;e, than when he employ|ed them in copying his capital pictures. Some original hi&s;tories of his are admitted into the col|lection at the New Palace and that collection would certainly be no &s;ufferer by the exchange if his Ca|tholic Maje&s;ty thought fit to &s;uper|&s;ede the&s;e pictures by &s;ome of his ca|pital Ba&s;&s;ans which hang in neglect and ob&s;curity at the Retiro. It rarely happens that indu&s;try and addre&s;s unite in the &s;ame per&s;on; but <HI>Luca Jordano</HI>'s application to his art was fully equal to the rapidity of his execution, and his oeconomy was equal to either: It is not there|fore to be wondered at that he ama&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable fortune in
<PB N="146" REF="150">
Spain and el&s;ewhere; impatient to return to his native country, he did not long furvive that wi&s;hed|for event, and died at Naples in 1704 at the age of 76. His &s;chool under <HI>Franci&s;co Solimena</HI> langui&s;hed for a time; but Italy after this pe|riod produced few or no painters of any eminence.</P>
<P>I have now carried down my account to the death of Charles the IId, which concludes the &s;e|venteenth century and places ano|ther family on the throne of Spain. Beyond this period I have pur&s;ued no particular enquiries; as to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of arts and improve|ments in Spain few people are in need of information, and I &s;hould unwillingly draw any compari&s;ons,

which might not be in favour of living profe&s;&s;ors. If Spain during the prefent century has not pro|duced &s;o many eminent painters as in tho&s;e we have been review|ing, the circum&s;tance is by no means peculiar to Spain as a king|dom; the declen&s;ion has been as great in Flanders and in France; in Italy much greater: The Princes of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon, who have reigned in Spain, cannot be charged with having &s;tarved the cau&s;e, if expence be the mea&s;ure of encouragement: The warme&s;t admirer of <HI>Mengs</HI> will not venture to &s;ay that his talents were not duly con&s;idered and rewarded by the prefent Sovereign, in who&s;e pay and employ he died. The
<PB N="148" REF="152">
reputation of this arti&s;t &s;tood high in Europe, perhaps the highe&s;t; but he found no &s;olid encourage|ment until he went into Spain; in Germany he painted miniatures and for England he painted co|pies; he was a fugitive from Dre&s;|den and a beggar in Rome; in the court of the Catholic King he found honour and emolument and exerci&s;ed his art in as re&s;pectable a &s;tile as <HI>Titiano</HI> did under Charles the Vth, <HI>Coello</HI> under Philip the IId, or <HI>Velazquez</HI> in the favour of Philip the IVth: Certain it is that under the&s;e Princes Spain pro|duced many eminent painters and was re&s;orted to by the mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed foreign ma&s;ters; but neither the good &s;en&s;e of Charles,
<PB N="149" REF="153">
the re&s;ources of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, nor the profe&s;&s;ional experience of Phi|lip the IVth could of them&s;elves have created an age of painters in Spain, if the &s;pirit of the nation had then been put under that &s;ub|jection and re&s;traint, which &s;ub&s;e|quent connexions have impo&s;ed upon it: A variety of cau&s;es may operate to depre&s;s national genius and character; not one of which may be ab&s;olutely chargeable to the ac|count of the Sovereign: A very able Prince may indeed find out tempo|rary expedients to &s;tem the torrent, when Art and Science are ru&s;hing to decay; but a man may mean very hone&s;tly and yet mi&s;s the di&s;|covery: When the introduction of &s;oreign profe&s;&s;ors into any king|dom

<P>It would not be ea&s;y to account for any rapid decline or &s;udden dearth of art and &s;cience, where there has been no want of encou|ragement or &s;carcity of employ, unle&s;s by referring to &s;ome &s;uch over-ruling cau&s;e, as I allude to: People, who are curious to find a natural rea&s;on for every event in the hi&s;tory of the human mind, have in the map of their di&s;cove|ries laid down the &s;prings and fountain-heads of genius in certain happy latitudes, as tho&s;e of Greece, Italy and Spain; but at the &s;ame time that a proper temperature of climate is acknowledged nece&s;&s;ary

for the exerci&s;e of &s;everal elegant arts, and perhaps for the inve&s;ti|gation of many u&s;eful &s;ciences, yet the hypothe&s;is which &s;ome adopt is far from &s;atisfactory; it would not be ea&s;y to find a rea&s;on upon their principle, why the Athenians &s;hould be ingenious and the The|bans dull; for whatever may have been &s;aid of the fogs of Boeotia in poetical ridicule, truth would tell us that it was the thickne&s;s of intel|lect in the native which gave the cli|mate its character, and not the cli|mate which conden&s;ed and clouded the brains of the inhabitants. There is rea&s;on to believe that the natives of old Rome, who were &s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in &s;cience, were defective in arts; their painters, &s;culptors

for my part it is matter of &s;ur|prize to me, not only how talents could be exerted, but rather how life could be endured in &s;uch an atmo&s;phere.

When mini&s;ters were

cho&s;en from the body of the Nobles, the power of the &s;tate was often lodged in elegant hands, and the whole order of Grandees &s;econded the example of the Crown by en|couraging talents; the policy of the pre&s;ent century has been to ex|clude the Nobility from any active &s;hare in government, and under the &s;hade of Royal jealou&s;y who can wonder if their dignity has drooped? Though the ambition of &s;ubjects may be dangerous to a Throne, it is oftentimes glorious to a &s;tate: Shut out all the brighter pro&s;pects of life from the view of the ri&s;ing generations, and you will &s;oon choak the &s;ources of me|rit in the &s;eeds of education; de&s;|pondency quickly ends in igno|rance.

If the light of the &s;un is to &s;hine upon none but mercenaries and intruders, the natives who &s;it in the &s;hade may murmur for a while; but when the darkne&s;s thickens and the night falls heavy upon them, their faculties will grow torpid and they will &s;leep away their lives and their re&s;ent|ments in lazine&s;s and oblivion: When the dregs of the vulgar are &s;et over the nobles and made rulers of the people, all conditions of men will be overthrown, no one will be found in his proper cla&s;s and &s;tation; the elevated party will exhibit but an awkward imitation of greatne&s;s, and by how much loftier the height &s;o much lower will be the fall of the party de|pre&s;&s;ed.

competition by lowering the dead, but by rai&s;ing the living: So far therefore as this &s;triking prefer|ence in favour of <HI>Mengs</HI> had effect in calling forth his exertions and fortifying his genius by a due pro|portion of &s;elf-confidence and pro|per opinion it appears to have been kingly and meritorious: <HI>Mengs</HI> him&s;elf with all his idolatry for <HI>Rafael</HI> thinks the world has produced arti&s;ts with which he cannot come into competition, and what is &s;ingular in the opinion is, that he does not refer to the works of the Grecian &s;culptors, but to their painters for that perfection, that idea of con&s;ummate beauty, which he finds wanting in his own great model. But as <HI>Mengs</HI> takes

up his idea of the &s;uperiority of the antient painters entirely upon hypothe&s;is, and no reference being to be had to ocular conviction, which alone can &s;ettle the que&s;tion, the world will gain more by the ingenuity of his conjectures, than truth will by his di&s;covery. There are other po&s;itions equally new in his po&s;thumous publication, which I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee canva&s;&s;ed in the true &s;pirit of candid critici&s;m. <HI>Mengs</HI> loved the truth, but he did not always find it out; under all the di&s;advantages of a contracted education, and &s;owered by the in&s;upportable &s;everity of his fa|ther's di&s;cipline, his habit became &s;aturnine and moro&s;e and his man|ners un&s;ocial and inelegant: He

had a great propen&s;ity for &s;peak|ing what are called plain truths, but which oftentimes in fact are no truths at all: His biographer and editor Azara has given us an in&s;tance of this &s;ort in a reply he made to Pope Clement XIV.

If the genius of <HI>Mengs</HI> had been capable of pro|ducing a compo&s;ition equal to that of the tragic and pathetic Ugolino, I am per&s;uaded &s;uch a &s;entence as the above would never have pa&s;&s;ed

in all or mo&s;t of his compo&s;itions, in which a fini&s;hed delicacy of pen|cil exhibits the <HI>Hand</HI> of the Arti&s;t, but gives no emanations of the <HI>Soul</HI> of the Ma&s;ter; if it is beauty, It does not warm; if it is &s;orrow, it excites no pity: That when the Angel announces the &s;alutation to Mary it is a me&s;&s;enger that has neither u&s;ed di&s;patch in the errand, nor grace in the delivery; that although <HI>Rubens</HI> was by one of his oracular &s;ayings condemned to the ignominious dullne&s;s of a Dutch tran&s;lator, <HI>Mengs</HI> was as capable of painting <HI>Rubens's</HI> Adoration, as he was of creating the Star in the Ea&s;t that u&s;hered the Magi: But the&s;e are que&s;tions above my ca|pacity; I re&s;ign <HI>Mengs</HI> to abler
