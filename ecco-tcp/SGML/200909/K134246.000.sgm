<L>FAR in a Wild, remote from publick view,</L>
<L>From Youth to Age, a rev'rend Hermit grew,</L>
<L>The Mo&s;s his Bed, the Cave his humble Cell,</L>
<L>His Food the Fruits, his Drink the Chry&s;tal Well:</L>
<L>Unknown to Man, with God he pa&s;s'd the Days,</L>
<L>Pray'r all his Bus'ne&s;s, all his Plea&s;ure Prai&s;e.</L>
<L>A life &s;o &s;acred, &s;uch &s;erene Repo&s;e</L>
<L>Seem'd Heaven it&s;elf; till one Sugge&s;tion ro&s;e;</L>
<L>That Vice &s;hould triumph, Virtue Vice obey,</L>
<L>Hence &s;prung &s;ome Doubts of Providence's Sway;</L>
<L>His Hopes no more a certain Pro&s;pect boa&s;t,</L>
<L>And all the Tenor of his Soul is lo&s;t:</L>
<L>To clear this Doubt, to know the World by Sight,</L>
<L>To find if Books or Swains report it right;</L>
<L>He with the Sun a ri&s;ing Journey went,</L>
<L>Sedate to think and watching each Event.</L>
<L>The Morn was wa&s;ted in the Pathle&s;s Gra&s;s,</L>
<L>And long and lone&s;ome was the Wild to pa&s;s;</L>
<L>But when the &s;outhern Sun had warm'd the Day</L>
<L>A Youth came po&s;ting o'er a cro&s;&s;ing Way.</L>
<L>His rayment decent, his complexion fair,</L>
<L>And &s;oft in graceful Ringlets wav'd his Hair,</L>
<L>Then near approaching, Father, Hail! he cry'd,</L>
<L>And Hail, my &s;on, the rev'rend Sire reply'd.</L>
<L>Words followed Words, from Que&s;tions An&s;wers flow'd</L>
<L>And Talk of various kind deceiv'd the Road.</L>
<L>Till each with other pleas'd and loth to part,</L>
<L>While in their Age they differ, join in Heart,</L>
<L>Thus &s;tands an aged Elm in Ivy bound;</L>
<L>Thus youthful Ivy cla&s;ps an Elm around.</L>
<L>Now &s;unk the Sun, the clo&s;ing Hour of Day</L>
<L>Came onward mantled o'er with Sober gray,</L>
<L>Nature in Silence bid the World repo&s;e,</L>
<L>When near the Road a &s;tately Palace ro&s;e,</L>
<L>It chanc'd the generous Ma&s;ter of the Dome</L>
<L>Still made his Hou&s;e the wand'ring Strangers Home</L>
<L>Yet &s;till the Kindne&s;s, from a thir&s;t of Prai&s;e</L>
<L>Prov'd the vain flouri&s;h of expen&s;ive Ea&s;e.</L>
<L>The Pair arrive: The liv'ry'd Servants wait,</L>
<L>Their Lord receives them at the pompous Gate</L>
<L>The Table groans with co&s;tly Piles of Food,</L>
<L>And all is more than ho&s;pitable good.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="2">Then led to re&s;t, the Day's long Toil they drown</L>
<L>Deep &s;unk in &s;leep and Silk and Heaps of Down.</L>
<L>At length 'tis Morn; and at the Dawn of Day</L>
<L>Along the wide Canals the Zephyrs play,</L>
<L>Up ri&s;e the Gue&s;ts obedient to the call,</L>
<L>An early Banquet deck't the &s;plendid Hall.</L>
<L>Rich lu&s;cious Wine a golden Ve&s;&s;el grac'd</L>
<L>Which the kind Ma&s;ter forc'd the Gue&s;ts to ta&s;te;</L>
<L>Then plea&s;'d and thankful, from the Porch they go</L>
<L>And, but the Landlord, none had cau&s;e of Woe:</L>
<L>His Cup was vani&s;h'd, for in &s;ecret Gui&s;e</L>
<L>The younger Gue&s;t purloin'd the glittering Prize.</L>
<L>As one who &s;pies a Serpent in his Way</L>
<L>Gli&s;t'ning and ba&s;king in the &s;ummers Ray,</L>
<L>Di&s;order'd &s;tops, to &s;hun the Danger near,</L>
<L>Then walks with Faintne&s;s on, and looks with Fear</L>
<L>So &s;eem'd the Sire when far upon the Road</L>
<L>The &s;hining &s;poil his wiley Partner &s;how'd;</L>
<L>He &s;topp'd with Silence, walk'd with trembling Heart,</L>
<L>And much he wi&s;h'd but dur&s;t not a&s;k to part,</L>
<L>Murmuring he lifts his Eyes and thinks it hard</L>
<L>That generous Actions meet a ba&s;e Reward.</L>
<L>While thus they pa&s;s the Sun his Glory &s;hrouds</L>
<L>The changing Skies hang out their Sable Clouds,</L>
<L>A Sound in Air pre&s;ag'd approaching Rain</L>
<L>And Bea&s;ts to Covert &s;cud a-cro&s;s the Plain:</L>
<L>Warn'd by the Signs the wand'ring Pair retreat</L>
<L>To &s;eek for Shelter at a neighbouring Seat;</L>
<L>'Twas built with Turrets on a ri&s;ing Ground,</L>
<L>And &s;trong and large and unimprov'd around,</L>
<L>Its Owner's Temper, timorous and &s;evere</L>
<L>Unkind and griping caus'd a De&s;art there.</L>
<L>As near the Mi&s;er's heavy Doors they drew</L>
<L>Fierce ri&s;ing Gu&s;ts with &s;udden Fury blew,</L>
<L>The nimble Light'ning mix'd with Showers began</L>
<L>And o'er their Heads loud rolling Thunder ran.</L>
<L>Here long they knock', but knock or call in vain,</L>
<L>Driv'n by the Wind and batter'd by the Rain;</L>
<L>At length &s;ome Pity warm'd the Ma&s;ter's Brea&s;t</L>
<L>'Twas then his Thre&s;hold fir&s;t receiv'd a Gue&s;t,</L>
<L>Slow creaking turns the Door with jealous Care</L>
<L>And half he welcomes in the &s;hivering Pair;</L>
<L>One frugal Faggot lights the naked Walls</L>
<L>And Natur's Fervor thro' their Limbs recalls,</L>
<L>Bread of the coar&s;e&s;t Sort with eager Wine</L>
<L>Each hardly granted, &s;erv'd them both to dine:</L>
<L>And when the Tempe&s;t fir&s;t appear'd to cea&s;e</L>
<L>A ready Warning bid them part in Peace&punc;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3">With &s;till Remark the pond'ring Hermit view'd,</L>
<L>In one &s;o rich, a Life &s;o poor and rude,</L>

<L>Lock the lo&s;t Wealth, a Thou&s;and want be&s;ide.</L>
<L>But what new Marks of Wonder &s;oon took place</L>
<L>In every &s;ettling Feature of his Face</L>
<L>When from his Ve&s;t the young Companion bore</L>
<L>That Cup the gen'rous Landlord own'd before,</L>
<L>And paid profu&s;ely with the precious Bowl.</L>
<L>The &s;tinted Kindne&s;s of this churli&s;h Soul.</L>
<L>But now the Clouds in airy Tumult fly,</L>
<L>The Sun emerging ope's an azure Sky,</L>
<L>A fre&s;her green the &s;melling Leaves di&s;play,</L>
<L>And glitt'ring as they tremble cheer the Day,</L>
<L>The Weather courts them from the Poor retreat,</L>
<L>And the glad Ma&s;ter bolts the wary Gate.</L>
<L>While hence they walk, the Pilgrim's Bo&s;om wrought,</L>
<L>With all the Travel of uncertain Thought,</L>
<L>His Partner's Acts without their Cau&s;e appear,</L>
<L>'Twas there a Vice, and &s;eemed a Madne&s;s here;</L>
<L>Dete&s;ting that, and pitying this, he goes</L>
<L>Lo&s;t and confounded with the various Shows.</L>
<L>Now Night's dim Shades involve the azure Sky,</L>
<L>Again they &s;earch and find a Lodging nigh.</L>
<L>The Soil improv'd around the Man&s;ion neat,</L>
<L>And neither poorly low nor idly great,</L>
<L>It &s;eem'd to &s;peak its Ma&s;ter's turn of Mind,</L>
<L>Content, and not for Prai&s;e, but Virtue kind;</L>
<L>Hither the Walkers turn with weary Feet,</L>
<L>Then ble&s;s the Man&s;ion and the Ma&s;ter greet,</L>
<L>Their Greeting fair be&s;tow'd with mode&s;t Gui&s;e,</L>
<L>The courteous Ma&s;ter hears and thus replies;</L>
<L>Without a vain, without a grudging Heart</L>
<L>To him who gives us all, I yield a Part,</L>
<L>From Him you come, for Him accept it here</L>
<L>A frank and &s;ober more than co&s;tly Cheer.</L>
<L>He &s;poke, and bid the welcome Table &s;pread.</L>
<L>Then talk'd of Virtue till the Time of Bed;</L>
<L>When the grave Hou&s;hold round his Hall repair,</L>
<L>Warn'd by a Bell, and clo&s;e the Hours with Prayer,</L>
<L>At length the World renew'd by calm Repo&s;e,</L>
<L>Was &s;trong for Toil; the dappled Morn aro&s;e.</L>
<L>Before the Pilgrims part, the Younger crept</L>
<L>Near the clos'd Cradle, where an Infant &s;lept,</L>
<L>And writh'd his Neck, the Landlords little Pride</L>
<L>O &s;trange Return! grew black and ga&s;ped, and dy'd,</L>
<L>Horror of Horrors! What his only Son?</L>
<L>How look'd our Hermit when the Fact was done?</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4">Not Hell, tho' Hell's black Jaws in &s;under Part,</L>

<L>He flies, but trembling fails to fly with &s;peed;</L>
<L>His Steps the Youth pur&s;ues, the Country lay</L>
<L>Perplex'd with Roads, a Servant &s;how'd the Way;</L>
<L>A River cro&s;s'd the Path, the Pa&s;&s;age o'er</L>

<L>Long Arms of Oaks an open Bridge &s;upply'd,</L>
<L>And deep the Waves beneath them bending Glide.</L>
<L>The Youth who &s;eem'd to watch a time to Sin,</L>
<L>Approach'd the carele&s;s Guide and thru&s;t him in:</L>
<L>Plunging he falls, and ri&s;ing lifts his Head,</L>
<L>Then fla&s;hing turns and &s;inks among the Dead.</L>
<L>Wild &s;parkling Rage inflames the Fathers Eyes</L>
<L>He bur&s;ts the Bands of Fear and madly cries,</L>
<L>Dete&s;ted Wretch&mdash;But &s;carce his Speech began</L>
<L>When the &s;trange Partner &s;eem'd no longer Man;</L>
<L>His youthful Face grew more &s;erenely &s;weet,</L>

<L>Fair Rounds of radiant Points inve&s;t his Hair,</L>
<L>Cele&s;tial Odours breath'd thro' purple Air;</L>
<L>The Form Etherial bur&s;ts upon his Sight</L>
<L>And moves in all the Maje&s;ty of Light:</L>
<L>Tho' loud at fir&s;t the Pilgrim's Pa&s;&s;ion grew,</L>
<L>Sudden he gaz'd and wi&s;t not what to do.</L>
<L>Surprize in &s;ecret Chains his Words &s;u&s;pends</L>
<L>And in a Calm his &s;ettling Temper ends.</L>
<L>But Silence here the beauteous Angel broke</L>

<P>THE In&s;piration of God, and the clear Information of the Holy Scriptures a&s;&s;ures us, that God re&s;erves his choice&s;t Secrets for the pure&s;t Minds, and that its uncleane&s;s of Spirit, not dif|ference of Method in &s;eeking after God, that &s;eparates us from him; true Holine&s;s being the only &s;afe Entrance into divine Know|ledge. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> declares Act. 10, 34, <HI>That he perceived of a Truth that God is no re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons: But in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh Righteou&s;ne&s;s is accepted with him.</HI> And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> al&s;o tells the <HI>Galatians</HI> Chap. 6, 15, <HI>That in Chri&s;t Je&s;us neither Circumci&s;&s;ion availeth any Thing, nor Uncircumci&s;&s;ion but a new Creature.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding the Clearne&s;s of the&s;e and many more &s;uch Doctrines contained in the Scriptures, Selfi&s;hne&s;s and Partia|lity, tho&s;e inhuman and ba&s;e Qualities have been &s;uffered to prevail even among&s;t &s;uch, as are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t pious in the &s;everal Sects and Parties of the Chri&s;tian Church: They have rai&s;ed and &s;till rai&s;e in every Communion, a &s;elfi&s;h partial Orthodoxy, which con&s;i&s;ts in courageou&s;ly defending all its Opinions and Practices, and condemning the Doctrines and Practices of others; and thus every one is train'd up in Defence of their own Church, their own Truth, their own Opinion; And he often is judged to have the mo&s;t Merit, and the mo&s;t Honour, who likes every Thing, and de|fends every Thing among&s;t them&s;elves, and leaves nothing uncen|&s;ured in tho&s;e that are of a different Communion. Now how can Truth, Goodne&s;s and Religion be more &s;truck at, than by &s;uch De|fenders of it? If you ask why the great Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> wrote &s;o many learned Books again&s;t all Parts of the Reformation, it is be|cau&s;e he was born in <HI>France,</HI> Had he been born in <HI>England,</HI> had he been bred <HI>at Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge,</HI> he might have rivall'd our great Bi&s;hop <HI>Stilling fleet,</HI> and would have wrote as many learn'd Folio's again&s;t the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> as he has done. And yet I will venture to &s;ay, that if each Church could produce but one Man a Piece, that had the Piety of an Apo&s;tle, and the impartial Love of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, they would not want half a Sheet of Paper to hold their Articles of Union, nor be half an Hour before they were of one Reli|gion. If we loved Truth as &s;uch; if we &s;ought it for its own &s;ake; if we loved our neighbours as our &s;elves; if we de&s;ir'd nothing by our Religion but to be acceptable to God; if we equally de&s;ir'd the Sal|vation of all Men; if we were afraid of Error only becau&s;e of its hurtful Nature to us, and our Brethren of other Communions, then nothing of this Spirit could have any Place in us. <HI>For God is Love, and they which dwell in God, they dwell in Love,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 4, 16. That uni|ver&s;al Love which gives the whole Strength of the Heart to God, and which makes us love every Man as we love our&s;elves, is the noble&s;t, the mo&s;t divine, and God-like State of the Soul, and is the utmo&s;t Perfection to which the mo&s;t perfect Religion can rai&s;e us, and no Religion does any Man any good, but &s;o far, as it brings this perfect Love with it. Perfection can no where be found, but in a pure disintere&s;ted Love of God and our Neighbour. There is
<PB N="7" REF="7">therefore a Communion of Saints in the Love of God, which no one can learn from that which is called Orthodoxy in the different Sects, but is only to be had by a total Dying to all worldly Views, by a pure Love of God, and by &s;uch an Unction from above, as de|livers the Mind from all Selfi&s;hne&s;s, and makes it love Truth and Goodne&s;s with an Equality of Affection in every Man, let his Name and Profe&s;&s;ion to Religion be what it may. And by thus uniting in Heart and Spirit with all that is holy and good in all profe&s;&s;ions, we enter into the true Communion of Saints, and become real Mem|bers of the true univer&s;al Chri&s;tian Church, tho' we are confin'd to the outward Wor&s;hip of only one particular Part of it. It is thus, that the Angels, as mini&s;tring Spirits, a&s;&s;i&s;t, join, unite and co-ope|rate with every Thing that is holy and good in every Divi&s;ion of Mankind. He that has been all his Life long u&s;ed to look with great Slight upon tho&s;e of other Profe&s;&s;ions, whom he has called <HI>Super&s;titious Biggots, dreaming Vi&s;ionaries, canting Enthu&s;ia&s;ts &amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t naturally expect they will be treated by God, as they have been by him; and if he had the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, &s;uch People would find it hard, to get a Place in it. But it &s;tands greatly in Hand to get rid of this Temper before we dye; for if nothing but univer&s;al Love can enter into the Kingdom of God, what can be more nece&s;&s;ary for us, than to be full of this Love before we dye?</P>
<P>We often hear of People of great Zeal and Orthodoxy, declaring on their Death-Beds their &s;trict Attachment to the Church of Eng|land, and making &s;olemn Prote&s;tations again&s;t all other Churches; but how much better would it be, if &s;uch a Per&s;on was to &s;ay, <Q>In this divided State of Chri&s;tendom, I mu&s;t conform to &s;ome outward divided Part of it, and therefore I have cho&s;en to live and dye in outward Communion with the church of England; fully believing, that if I wor&s;hip God in Spirit and in Truth, in this divided Part of the Church, I &s;hall be as acceptable to him, as if I had been a faithful Member of the one whole Church before it was broken into &s;eparate Parts. But as I am now going out of this di&s;ordered Divi&s;ion, into a more univer&s;al State of Things, as I am going to the God of all Churches, to a Kingdom of univer|&s;al Love, which mu&s;t have its Inhabitants from all People, Nati|ons, and Languages of the Earth; &s;o in this Spirit of univer&s;al Love, I de&s;ire to perform my la&s;t Act of Communion in this divid|ed Church, uniting and joining in Heart and Spirit with all that is Chri&s;tian, Holy, Good and acceptable to God in all other Churches; praying, from the Bottom of my Soul, that every Church may have its Saints; that God's Kingdom may come, his Will be done in every Divi&s;ion of Chri&s;tians and Men, and that every Thing that hath Breath may prai&s;e the Lord?</Q></P>

<P>AN Eminent Servant of God who had known deliver|ance from the dark Powers and experimentally felt the Powers of the World to come a few Hours before his Death, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the following Words. <Q>There is a Spirit which I feel, that delights to do no Evil, nor to revenge any wrong, but delights to endure all Things, in Hopes to enjoy its own in the End; Its Hope is, to outlive all Wrath and Contention, and to weary out all Exaltation and Cruelty, or what&s;oever is of a Nature contrary to it&s;elf; it &s;ees to the End of all Temptations; as it bears no Evil in it &s;elf, &s;o it conceives none in Thought to any other; for its Ground and Spring is the Mercies and Forgivene&s;s of God; its Crown is Meekne&s;s; its Life is everla&s;ting Love unfeigned, and takes its Kingdom with Intreaty, and not with Con|tention, and keeps it by lowline&s;s of Mind; in God a|lone it can rejoice, tho' none el&s;e regard it, or can own its Life; 'tis conceived in Sorrow, and brought forth without any to pity it, nor doth it murmur at Grief and Oppre&s;&s;ion; it never rejoiceth but thro' Sufferings, for with the World's Joy it is murdered. I found it alone being for&s;aken: I have Fellow&s;hip therein with them that lived in Dens and de&s;olate Places of the Earth, who through Death obtained Re&s;urrection and eternal holy Life.</Q></P>
