<HEAD>THOUGHTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>"THE times that tried men's &s;ouls<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The&s;e are the times that try men's &s;ouls." <HI>Cri&s;is, No.</HI> 1, <HI>publi&s;hed December</HI> 19, 1776.</NOTE>" are over&mdash;and the greate&s;t and compleate&s;t Revolution the world ever knew, is gloriou&s;ly and happily accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>BUT to pa&s;s from the extremes of danger to &s;afety&mdash;from the tumult of war to the tranquility of peace, though &s;weet in con|templation, requires a gradual compo&s;ure of the &s;en&s;es to receive it. Even calmne&s;s has the power of &s;tunning when it opens too in|&s;tantly
<PB N="2" REF="4">upon us. The long and raging hur|ricane that &s;hould cea&s;e in a moment, would leave us in a &s;tate rather of wonder than en|joyment; and &s;ome moments of recollection mu&s;t pa&s;s before we could be capable of ta&s;ting the full felicity of repo&s;e. There are but few in&s;tances in which the mind is fitted for &s;udden tran&s;itions: it takes in its plea&s;ures by reflection and compari&s;on, and tho&s;e mu&s;t have time to act, before the reli&s;h for new &s;cenes is compleat.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent ca&s;e&mdash;the mighty magni|tude of the object&mdash;the various uncertainties of fate it has undergone&mdash;the numerous and complicated dangers we have &s;uffered or e&s;caped&mdash;the eminence we now &s;tand on, and the va&s;t pro&s;pect before us, mu&s;t all con&s;pire to impre&s;s us with contemplation.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5" MS="y">To &s;ee it in our power to make a world happy&mdash;to teach mankind the art of being &s;o&mdash;to exhibit on the theatre of the univer&s;e a character hitherto unknown&mdash;and to have, as it were, a new creation entru&s;ted to our hands, are honours that command reflection, and can neither be too highly e&s;timated, nor too gratefully received.</P>
<P>IN this pau&s;e then of recollection&mdash;while the &s;torm is cea&s;ing, and the long-agitated mind vibrating to a re&s;t, let us look back on the &s;cenes we have pa&s;&s;ed, and learn from experience what is yet to be done.</P>
<P>NEVER, I &s;ay, had a country &s;o many openings to happine&s;s as this. Her &s;etting out into life, like the ri&s;ing of a fair morn|ing, was unclouded and promi&s;ing. Her cau&s;e was good; her principles ju&s;t and li|beral;
<PB N="4" REF="6">her temper &s;erene and firm; her conduct regulated by the nice&s;t &s;teps of order; and every thing about her wore the mark of honour.</P>
<P>IT is not every country (perhaps there is not another in the world) that can boa&s;t &s;o fair an origin. Even the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of America corre&s;ponds with the character of the Revolution. Rome, once the proud mi&s;tre&s;s of the univer&s;e, was originally a band of ruffians. Plunder and rapine made her rich, and her oppre&s;&s;ion of millions made her great. But America needs never be a&s;hamed to tell her birth, nor relate the &s;tages by which &s;he ro&s;e to empire.</P>
<P>THE remembrance, then, of what is pa&s;t, if it operates rightly, mu&s;t in&s;pire her with the mo&s;t laudable of all ambition, that of
<PB N="5" REF="7">adding to the fair fame &s;he began with. The world has &s;een her great in adver&s;ity; &s;truggling, without a thought of yielding, beneath accumulated difficulties; bravely, nay proudly, encountering di&s;tre&s;s, and ri&s;ing in re&s;olution as the &s;torm encrea&s;ed. All this is ju&s;tly due to her, for her fortitude has merited the character. Let, then, the world &s;ee that &s;he can bear pro&s;perity; and that her hone&s;t virtue in time of peace, is equal to the brave&s;t virtue in time of war.</P>
<P>SHE is now de&s;cending to the &s;cenes of quiet and dome&s;tic life; not beneath the cypre&s;s &s;hade of di&s;appointment, but to en|joy in her own land, and under her own vine, the &s;weets of her labours, and the re|ward of her toil. In this &s;ituation, may &s;he never forget, that a fair national reputation
<PB N="6" REF="8">is of as much importance as independence: that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a charm which wins upon the world, and makes even enemies civil: that it gives a dignity which is often &s;upe|rior to power, and commands a reverence where pomp and &s;plendor fail.</P>
<P>IT would be a circum&s;tance ever to be la|mented, and never to be forgotten, were a &s;ingle blot, from any cau&s;e whatever, &s;uf|fered to fall on a Revolution, which to the end of time mu&s;t be an honour to the age that accompli&s;hed it; and which has contributed more to enlighten the world, and diffu&s;e a &s;pirit of freedom and liberality among man|kind, than any human event (if this can be called one) that never preceded it.</P>
<P>IT is not among the lea&s;t of the calamities of a long-continued war, that it unhinges
<PB N="7" REF="9">the mind from tho&s;e nice &s;en&s;ations which at other times appear &s;o amiable. The conti|nual &s;pectacle of woe blunts the finer feel|ings, and the nece&s;&s;ity of bearing with the &s;ight renders it familiar. In like manner are many of the moral obligations of &s;o|ciety weakened, till the cu&s;tom of acting by nece&s;&s;ity, becomes an apology where it is truly a crime. Yet let but a nation con|ceive rightly of its character, and it will be cha&s;tely ju&s;t in protecting it. None ever be|gan with a fairer than America, and none can be under a greater obligation to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>THE Debt which America has con|tracted, compared with the Cau&s;e &s;he has gained, and the advantages to flow from it, ought &s;carcely to be mentioned. She has it in her choice to do, and to live, as happily as &s;he plea&s;es. The world is
<PB N="8" REF="10">in her hands. She has now no Foreign Power to monopolize her Commerce, per|plex her Legi&s;lation, or controul her Pro&s;|perity. The &s;truggle is over which mu&s;t one day have happened, and, perhaps, ne|ver could have have happened at a better time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the Revolution began at the exact period of time be&s;t fitted to the purpo&s;e is &s;ufficiently proved by the event.&mdash;But the great hinge on which the whole ma|chine turned is the <HI>Union of the States;</HI> and this Union was naturally produced by the inability of any one State to &s;upport it&s;elf again&s;t a foreign enemy without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the re&s;t.
<P>Had the States &s;everally been le&s;s able than they were when the war began, their united &s;trength would not have been equal to the undertaking, and they mu&s;t, in all human probability, have failed.&mdash;And on the other hand, had they &s;everally been more able, they might not have &s;een, or, what is more, might not have felt the nece&s;&s;ity of uniting; and either by attempting to &s;tand alone, or in &s;mall confederacies, would have been &s;eparately conquered.</P>
<P>Now, as we cannot &s;ee a time (and many years mu&s;t pa&s;s away before it can arrive) when the &s;trength of any one State, or of &s;everal united, can be equal to the whole of the pre&s;ent United States; and as we have &s;een the extreme difficulty of collectively pro&s;ecuting the war to a &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue, and pre&s;erving our national impor|tance in the world; therefore, from the experience we have had, and the knowledge we have gained, we mu&s;t, unle&s;s we make a wa&s;te of wi&s;dom, be &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the advantage, as well as the nece&s;&s;ity, of &s;trength|ening that happy Union which has been our &s;alvation, and without which we &s;hould have been a ruined people.</P>
<P>While I was writing this note, I ca&s;t my eye on the pamphlet <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> from which I &s;hall make an ex|tract, as it applies exactly to the ca&s;e. It is as follows:</P>
<Q><P>I have never met with a man, either in England or America, who hath not confe&s;&s;ed his opinion, that a &s;eparation between the countries would take place one time or other: and there is no in&s;tance in which we have &s;hewn le&s;s judgment than endeavouring to de|&s;cribe, what we call, the ripene&s;s or fitne&s;s of the Con|tinent for Independence.</P>
<P>As all men allow the mea&s;ure, and differ only in their opinion of the time, let us, in order to remove mi&s;takes, take a general &s;urvey of things, and en|deavour, if po&s;&s;ible, to find out the <HI>very time.</HI> But we need not go far; the enquiry cea&s;es at once, for <HI>the time hath found us.</HI> The general concurrence, the glorious Union of all things prove the fact.</P>
<P>It is not in numbers, but in an Union, that our great &s;trength lies. The Continent is ju&s;t arrived at that pitch of &s;trength, in which no &s;ingle Colony is able to &s;upport it&s;elf, and the whole, when united, can accompli&s;h the matter: and either more or le&s;s than this, might be fatal in its effects.</P> <BIBL><HI>Pamphlet Common Sen&s;e.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>;
and in&s;tead of a domineering
<PB N="9" REF="11">Ma&s;ter, &s;he has gained an Ally, who&s;e ex|emplary greatne&s;s, and univer&s;al liberality,
<PB N="10" REF="12">have extorted a confe&s;&s;ion even from her enemies.</P>
<P>WITH the ble&s;&s;ings of Peace, Inde|pendence, and an univer&s;al Commerce, the States, individually and collectively, will have lei&s;ure and opportunity to regulate and e&s;tabli&s;h their dome&s;tic concerns, and to put it beyond the power of calumny to throw the lea&s;t reflection on their honour. Cha|racter
<PB N="11" REF="13">is much ea&s;ier kept than recovered; and that man, if any &s;uch there be, who, from any &s;ini&s;ter views, or littlene&s;s of &s;oul, lends un&s;een his hand to injure it, contrives a wound it will never be in his power to heal.</P>
<P>As we have e&s;tabli&s;hed an Inheritance for Po&s;terity, let that Inheritance de&s;cend with every mark of an honourable conveyance. The little it will co&s;t, compared with the worth of the States, the greatne&s;s of the object, and the value of national character, will be a profitable exchange.</P>
<P>BUT that which mu&s;t more forcibly &s;trike a thoughtful penetrating mind, and which includes and renders ea&s;y all inferior concerns, is the <HI>Union of the States.</HI> On this our great national character depends.
<PB N="12" REF="14">It is this which mu&s;t give us importance abroad and &s;ecurity at home. It is through this only that we are, or can be nationally known in the world. It is the flag of the United States which renders our &s;hips and commerce &s;afe on the &s;eas, or in a foreign port. Our Mediterranean pa&s;&s;es mu&s;t be obtained under the &s;ame &s;tyle. All our treaties, whether of alliance, peace, or commerce, are formed under the Sovereign|ty of the United States, and Europe knows us by no other name or title.</P>
<P>THE divi&s;ion of the Empire into States is for our own convenience, but abroad this di&s;tinction cea&s;es. The affairs of each State are local. They can go no farther than to it&s;elf; and were the whole worth of even the riche&s;t of them expended in revenue, it would not be &s;ufficient to &s;upport Sove|reignty
<PB N="13" REF="15">again&s;t a foreign attack. In &s;hort, we have no other national &s;overeignty than as United States. It would even be fatal for us if we had&mdash;too expen&s;ive to be main|tained, and impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;upported. Individuals or individual States may call them&s;elves what they plea&s;e; but the world, and e&s;pecially the world of enemies, is not to be held in a awe by the whi&s;tling of a name. Sovereignty mu&s;t have power to protect all the parts which compo&s;e and con|&s;titute it: and as <HI>United States</HI> we are equal to the importance of the title, but otherwi&s;e we are not. Our Union, well and wi&s;ely regulated and cemented, is the cheape&s;t way of being great&mdash;the ea&s;ie&s;t way of be|ing powerful&mdash;and the happie&s;t invention in government which the circum&s;tances of America can admit of; becau&s;e it collects from each State, that which, by being in|adequate,
<PB N="14" REF="16">can be of no u&s;e to it, and forms an aggregate that &s;erves for all.</P>
<P>THE States of Holland are an unfortunate in&s;tance of the effects of individual &s;overeign|ty. Their disjointed condition expo&s;es them to numerous intrigues, lo&s;&s;es, calamities, and enemies, and the almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ibility of bringing their mea&s;ures to a deci&s;ion; and that deci&s;ion into execution, is to them, and would be to us, a &s;ource of endle&s;s mi&s;|fortune.</P>
<P>IT is with confederate States as with in|dividuals in &s;ociety: &s;omething mu&s;t be yielded up to make the whole &s;ecure. In this view of things we gain by what we give, and draw an annual intere&s;t greater than the capital. I ever feel my&s;elf hurt when I hear
<PB N="15" REF="17">the Union, that great palladium of our li|berty and &s;afety, the lea&s;t irreverently &s;poken of. It is the mo&s;t &s;acred thing in the con&s;titution of America, and that which every man &s;hould be the mo&s;t proud and tender of. Our citizen&s;hip in the United States is our national character: our citizen|&s;hip in any particular State is only our local di&s;tinction. By the latter we are known at home; by the former to the world. Our great title is <HI>Americans;</HI> our inferior one varies with the place.</P>
<P>So far as my endeavours could go, they have all been directed to conciliate the affec|tions, unite the intere&s;ts, and draw and keep the mind of the country together; and the better to a&s;&s;i&s;t in this foundation-work of the Revolution, I have avoided all places of pro|fit or office, either in the State I live in or in
<PB N="16" REF="18">the United States; kept my&s;elf at a di&s;tance from all parties and party connections, and even di&s;regarded all private and inferior con|cerns: and when we take into view the great work we have gone through, and feel, as we ought to feel, the ju&s;t importance of it, we &s;hall then &s;ee, that the little wranglings and indecent contentions of per&s;onal party, are as di&s;honourable to our characters, as they are injurious to our repo&s;e.</P>
<P>It was the cau&s;e of America that made me an author. The force with which it &s;truck my mind, and the dangerous condition the country appeared to me in, by courting an impo&s;&s;ible and unnatural reconciliation with tho&s;e who were determined to reduce her, in&s;tead of &s;triking out into the only line that could cement and &s;ave her, <HI>A Declaration of Independence</HI>&mdash;made it impo&s;&s;ible for me,
<PB N="17" REF="19">feeling as I did, to be &s;ilent: and if, in the cour&s;e of more than &s;even years, I have ren|dered her any &s;ervice, I have likewi&s;e added &s;omething to the reputation of literature, by freely and di&s;intere&s;tedly employing it in the great cau&s;e of mankind, and &s;hewing there may be genius without pro&s;titution.</P>
<P>INDEPENDENCE always appeared to me practicable and probable, provided the &s;en|timent of the country could be formed and held to the object: and there is no in&s;tance in the world, where a people &s;o extended, and wedded to former habits of thinking, and under &s;uch a variety of circum&s;tances, were &s;o in&s;tantly and effectually pervaded, by a turn in politics, as in the ca&s;e of Inde|pendence, and who &s;upported their opinion, undimini&s;hed, through &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of good and ill fortune, till they crowned it with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">BUT as the &s;cenes of war are clo&s;ed, and every man preparing for home and happier times, I therefore take my leave of the &s;ub|ject. I have mo&s;t &s;incerely followed it from beginning to end, and through all its turns and windings: and whatever country I may hereafter be in, I &s;hall always feel an hone&s;t pride at the part I have taken and acted, and a gratitude to Nature and Providence for put|ting it in my power to be of &s;ome u&s;e to mankind.</P>
