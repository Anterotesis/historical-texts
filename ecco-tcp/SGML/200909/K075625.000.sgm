<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I believe you are a gentleman, <HI>who is not unwilling that his actions &s;hould be faithful|ly tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity;</HI> and as nobody can have a more &s;en&s;ible regard for your great virtues and abilities than my &s;elf, I beg leave to make the world acquaint|ed with them in the following dedication.</P>
<P>YOU came into the world, &s;ir, under the influence of a lucky planet, being born of an ancient and worthy family, to a plentiful fortune, as well as great natural endowments and hereditary virtues; all which you have &s;ince im|proved by a liberal education, under the care of one of the able&s;t pillars of our church, and (as his ingenious friend Mr. MIST emphatically &s;tiles him) the <HI>brighte&s;t ornament of the brighte&s;t body in the world;</HI> by his pre|cepts and example you have fini&s;hed in your &s;elf one of the fine&s;t gentlemen and greate&s;t &s;cholars of our age.</P>
<Q><L>Tran&s;planting, one by one, into your life</L>
<L>His bright perfections, till you &s;hine like him.</L></Q>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible that one thus richly endowed by na|ture and improved by art, &s;hould not make a very extra|ordinary figure. You di&s;covered the earlie&s;t marks of a great genius, and at an age when we &s;ay of others that they are promi&s;ing youths, you were arrived at the high|e&s;t
<PB REF="3">
perfection and maturity of manhood. You brought with you from &s;chool a thorough knowledge of the cla&s;&s;ical writers and the learned languages, &s;o that you had no|thing to interrupt your &s;tricter academical &s;tudies; by which means and a clo&s;e application, you &s;oon became a deep logician, a profound philo&s;opher, and an excellent mathematician. In &s;hort, you grew a compleat ma&s;ter of mo&s;t arts and &s;ciences (particularly necromancy and metaphy&s;icks) and no part of learning has entirely e&s;cap|ed your knowledge.</P>
<P>NOR have you cultivated your <HI>Head</HI> only, (which in this age is the lea&s;t part of a liberal character) but e|ven your <HI>heels,</HI> &s;ir, di&s;cover the marks of an academi|cal education; that pretty flutter in your gait, that care|le&s;s &s;wing of your arms, and that polite turn of your head may, to &s;ome people, &s;eem only to be the natural effect of well proportion'd limbs and a regular body; but, to a nice ob&s;erver, every motion will appear <HI>&s;yllogi&s;ti|cal,</HI> and &s;trictly conformable to <HI>Mode</HI> and <HI>Figure:</HI> How often have I &s;een you come into a room in <HI>Barbara</HI> and &s;alute the company in <HI>Darii?</HI> how often do you pay your devotions in <HI>Ferio,</HI> and dance in <HI>Baralipton?</HI> as this is an art perhaps peculiar to your&s;elf and the author of <HI>Mathe|matical rules for Dancing,</HI> it is no wonder that you have gain'd the character of the polite&s;t gentleman in the u|niver&s;ity and triumph'd over all your rivals in the affec|tions of the ladies.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t not dwell too long upon one of your mo&s;t trifling qualifications, con&s;idering how many there are &s;till behind, and how narrow a compa&s;s my book&s;eller has pre&s;cribed me to celebrate them in.</P>
<P>GIVE me leave therefore, learned &s;ir, in a cur&s;ory man|ner to mention your humanity, candour, and publick &s;pirit; your acute wit, unbya&s;s'd judgment, and penetrat|ing under&s;tanding; your nice &s;ence of honour, magnani|mity, and intrepid courage; your cha&s;tity, &s;obriety, and un&s;potted virtue; but above all, your un&s;haken loyalty
<PB REF="4">
(in the true &s;ence of the word) your invincible orthodoxy and &s;trict adherence to the catholick church.</P>
<P>YOUR intimate acquaintance with the <HI>modern Langu|ages</HI> and your profound skill in <HI>modern Hi&s;tory</HI> are &s;o well known, that it would be matter of great a&s;toni&s;h|ment to me, how you could e&s;cape being nominated to a certain Prof&mdash;ip lately e&s;tabli&s;hed, if I did not con|&s;ider how &s;ome people &mdash; I can hardly keep it in, not|with&s;tanding all their <HI>pains</HI> and <HI>penalties;</HI> but we were pretty even with them at la&s;t; and I am &s;ure it is no di&s;appointment to you, who choo&s;e to do good and pro|pagate knowledge, <HI>without any Reward.</HI></P>
<P>WITH all the&s;e &s;hining accompli&s;hments (however you may be de&s;pi&s;ed el&s;ewhere) you could not fail of acquir|ing a very popular reputation in the famous univer&s;ity of OXFORD, which, amid&s;t the general depravity of man|kind, and the lamentable increa&s;e of fanatici&s;m both in church and &s;tate, has maintained its antient purity in the wor&s;t of times, even (as our ingenious profe&s;&s;or of poetry once ob&s;erved) <HI>whil&s;t armed Forces were within our Walls.</HI> Accordingly you have proceeded in the re|gular method pre&s;cribed by our &s;tatutes (too &s;low indeed for your a&s;piring merit) to the highe&s;t degree which our univer&s;ity can confer, and whenever you &s;hall plea&s;e to oblige the world with any of tho&s;e valuable manu&s;cripts which enrich your cabinet, you may dignify the title page with <HI>Fellow of a College and Doctor of civil Law.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING &s;aid thus much (which is much too lit|tle) of you, my pre&s;ent mo&s;t honoured Patron; give me leave, Sir, (with the imputation of as little va|nity as po&s;&s;ible) to &s;ay &s;omething of my &s;elf and my following performance.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t know, Sir, that I have been &s;everal years a matriculated &s;on of this antient univer&s;ity; and though, for want of the &s;ame natural talents, and the &s;ame application, I have not done the good old lady half the honour which you have done, nor re|ceived
<PB REF="5">
half &s;o many honours from her hands; yet I &s;hall never forget the obligations which I lie under to her, for that &s;mall portion of learning which I po&s;|&s;e&s;s, and that little figure which I make in the world. A due &s;en&s;e of the&s;e obligations join'd with a violent indignation to &s;ee her traduced and vilified by &s;ome per&s;ons, who ought to know and practice bet|ter, has occa&s;ioned the following &s;heets; in which I have endeavoured to perpetuate her name, and to rai&s;e up a column of my own gratitude, that it may not be &s;aid of me in future ages (as I fear it will be of too many) that I would not <HI>look to the rock from whence I was hewn, nor to the pit from whence I was digged.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot, in this place, forbear a&s;&s;uring you, that when I fir&s;t re&s;olved upon this undertaking, you jump'd immediately into my head, as the fitte&s;t per&s;on to pa|tronize it; and I have not been able, with all my deli|beration, to alter my opinion ever &s;ince: &s;o that, you &s;ee, it was by a &s;ort of in&s;piration that I de&s;ire your protection of this Work.</P>
<P>I know the conclu&s;ion of my <HI>POEM,</HI> where I pre&s;age my own future glory, will be particulary cavil'd at, and I &s;hall be call'd a vain conceited coxcomb for my pains; but in an&s;wer to this, without in&s;i&s;ting on the examples of <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Ovid</HI> in the &s;ame ca&s;e, I &s;ay that it is an intolerable grievance upon modern authors to be re&s;trained from commending their own works. No body expects that the good wives of <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ling&s;gate</HI> &s;hould cry &s;tinking fi&s;h, or that any vintner in town &s;hould tell you that his wine is &s;our: nay, e|very &s;urly ra&s;cal of a &s;hoemaker &s;hall take the liberty to look you &s;aucily in the face, when he puts you to execrable torture with a pair of new &s;hoes, and &s;wear that they &s;it as ea&s;y as your mi&s;tre&s;s's gloves; whereas it is expected of an author that he &s;hould cry down his own ware, and though he publi&s;hes a better poem
<PB REF="6">
than ever <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil</HI> did, &s;hould make a thou|&s;and excu&s;es for troubling the world with &s;uch indiffer|ent &s;tuff, as he is obliged to call it, to the manife&s;t hinderance of his market, and again&s;t the fulle&s;t con|viction of his own mind. I think therefore every ma|nufacturer of the brain ought to ri&s;e up again&s;t this growing evil, and a&s;&s;ert the &s;ame right, with all other trade&s;men and artificers, to warrant his goods, and thereby promote the &s;ale of them as much as he can.</P>
<P>FOR my part (though I do not think my &s;elf vain|er than other men) I will venture to affirm (in defi|ance of all the criticks and ignorant carping ra&s;cals in <HI>England</HI>) that the following poem is a perfect fini&s;h'd peice, according to the &s;tricte&s;t rules of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Longinus,</HI> whom (I will be again bold to &s;ay) no body has &s;tudied more, or under&s;tands better than my &s;elf; I maintain, that the model is ju&s;t and regular, the diction truely &s;ublime, and the panegyrick well hit off: if it be ob|jected, that I have now and then introduced little &s;ar|ca&s;ms and &s;trokes of &s;atire, I have <HI>Virgil, Horace,</HI> and all the be&s;t authors, both antient and modern, to ju&s;ti|fy me in &s;uch occa&s;ional deviations.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o their authority (as I could ea&s;ily prove from a multitude of in&s;tances) to apologize for the many <HI>beautiful &s;imiles</HI> and <HI>u&s;eful digre&s;&s;ions,</HI> with which I have thought fit to illu&s;trate and diver&s;ify the whole: they are all on my &s;ide, and &s;o I have no apprehen&s;ions from them; but I am terribly afraid of a certain merry gentleman in this town, who frequently &s;ays, that <HI>there is nothing in the world &s;o</HI> unlike <HI>as &s;imiles:</HI> he might with the &s;ame rea&s;on add, and I hope he will do it, <HI>that nothing is &s;o pertinent as digre&s;&s;ions;</HI> this will make us &s;ome amends, and give us with one hand, what he takes away with the other.</P>
<P>As for my &s;elf I have laboured to make my <HI>&s;imiles</HI> as <HI>like,</HI> and my <HI>digre&s;&s;ions</HI> as <HI>pertinent</HI> as po&s;&s;ibly I could; I am &s;ure it has co&s;t me a great deal of pains
<PB REF="7">
(as, I doubt not, it has mo&s;t authors) to bring them in and make them look pat to the purpo&s;e; nay, I could not with all my pains, lug in &s;ome, which I was not a little fond of, and particularly the following di&s;tich.</P>
<Q><L>So barren <HI>chalk,</HI> which no production yields,</L>
<L>Burnt into <HI>lime,</HI> manures the neighbouring fields.</L></Q>
<P>YOU mu&s;t allow, &s;ir, that this is a very pretty &s;imile, and if it could but be hand&s;omely applied, would make a good figure in my poem; but after the &s;tricte&s;t examination, I could not hedge it in any where in the following pages, and being loth that &s;o uncom|mon a thought &s;hould be lo&s;t, I have in&s;erted it in this place, making it my reque&s;t, that if you, or any of my candid readers can think of any method to in|troduce it properly into the body of my work, you will oblige me with the hint, and the favour &s;hall be grate|fully acknowledged in the &s;econd edition.</P>
<P>I had al&s;o a mind to foi&s;t in a digre&s;&s;ion again&s;t the late bills for <HI>in&s;pecting drugs, medicines, &amp;c.</HI> and for <HI>ex|ci&s;ing</HI> of <HI>tea, coffee,</HI> and <HI>chocolate;</HI> but not being able to di&s;cover any relation which they have to the univer|&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> I was obliged to re&s;erve it for a more proper occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>SIR, I was going on to acquaint you with &s;ome more of my projects; but my book&s;eller is ju&s;t come in, and tells me, that I mu&s;t break off immediately, and that he cannot afford a line more for a &s;hilling, which is the price we have agreed to fix upon this &s;ummer-piece of entertain|ment for gentlemen and ladies: what therefore I have farther to &s;ay to you, upon this and all other occa&s;ions, mu&s;t be defer'd till another opportunity, which, you may depend upon, &s;hall not be neglected by</P>
