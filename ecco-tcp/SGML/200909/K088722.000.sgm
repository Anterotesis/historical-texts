<HEAD>AN EXCURSION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN ever I have read the de&s;crip|tions given by travellers of foreign countries, in which their beauties and antiquities were lavi&s;hly prai&s;ed, I have always regretted a neglect which has long attended the delightful &s;cences at home. The monuments of antiquity di&s;per&s;ed over this i&s;land, are many and various;
<PB N="2" REF="3">&s;ome of them aro&s;e in the remote&s;t ages, and point out to us the revolutions and hi&s;tory of our own kingdom: a degree of knowledge which ought to &s;tand fir&s;t in importance with every Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments gave ri&s;e to a &s;um|mer's excur&s;ion, the plea&s;ures of which I have endeavoured to communicate to the reader in the following pages.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t requi&s;ites for a plea&s;ure jaunt, are companions of &s;uitable ta&s;te and cu|rio&s;ity, and conveniences for the journey &mdash;they encrea&s;e every enjoyment, and make every &s;cene which pre&s;ents it&s;elf more agreeable&mdash;the&s;e were not wanting.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, we were conduc|ted to BOWES, in York&s;hire; to which place I &s;hall fir&s;t attempt engaging the attention of the reader.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">BOWES is of great antiquity, in which is all its merit.&mdash;The country around it is meanly cultivated, its habitations are melancholy, and what alone claims the attention of a traveller, is the ruin of a ca&s;tle, &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to have been of Roman con&s;truction; but by others to be the Turris de Arcubus, built by Allan, fir&s;t Earl of Richmond, in the Conque|ror's time. It is &s;ituated on the old Ro|man way, which leads from Cathrick, or the antient Cateractonium.</P>
<P>This ca&s;tle is fifty-three feet high, is built of hewn &s;tone, of excellent work|man&s;hip, forming a &s;quare of equal &s;ides of eighty-one feet each; the windows are irregular, and the walls, which are ce|mented with lime mixed with &s;mall flints, are near five feet in thickne&s;s.&mdash;It is now much defaced, the outward ca&s;ing having
<PB N="4" REF="5">been &s;tripped off in many places; within it appears to have been divided into &s;eve|ral apartments, one of the lower divi&s;ions of which was &s;upported by a central pil|lar, from whence a roof of arches has ari&s;en, the groins &s;till projecting from the walls.</P>
<P>This ca&s;tle is &s;ituated on the brink of a hill, declining &s;wiftly to the &s;outhward, at who&s;e foot runs the river Greta:&mdash;It is &s;urrounded with a deep ditch, on the &s;outh &s;ide of which is a plain or platform, apparently calculated for the u&s;e of the ca&s;tle.&mdash;On the ea&s;tern point of this plat|form we were &s;hewn the &s;cite and remains of a bath, with its aqueduct, which are now totally in ruins, and grown over with weeds and brambles.</P>
<P>On a late inclo&s;ure of &s;ome common lands belonging to Bowes, an antient
<PB N="5" REF="6">aqueduct was di&s;covered, which had con|veyed the water from a place called Le|var, or Levy Pool, near two miles di&s;tant from the ca&s;tle; which was &s;ufficient, at once to &s;upply the garri&s;on with fre&s;h water, and al&s;o the baths.</P>
<P>A few &s;canty meadows border the river Greta, and cultivation &s;eems to awake in ignorance over the adjoining lands; where the plough &s;hare begins to make the traces of indu&s;try on the &s;kirts of the de&s;ert
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Camden who wrote in the latter part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and of the 15th century, &s;peaking of this place, &s;ays, <Q>Bowes, which al&s;o is written Bowgh, was then a little village; where in preceding ages the Earls of Richmond had a pretty ca&s;telet, the cu&s;toms of thorough toll, and their furcas, which was the power of executing criminals. In old times it was called in Antonin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Itinirarie, Levatrae &amp; Lavatrae; the di&s;tance and &s;cite thereof by the High-&s;treet, which is here evidently apparent, do prove it: but what
<PB N="6" REF="7">greatly confirms the antiquity of it, is an antient large &s;tone in the church, u&s;ed by the Romans for an altar, with the following in&s;cription upon it, to the honour of Hadrian the Emperor.

Whil&s;t Virius Lupus ruled as Lieutenant General and
<PB N="7" REF="8">Propraetor of Britain, under Severus the Emperor, the fir&s;t cohort of the Thracians laid here in garri&s;on; for who&s;e u&s;e he rebuilt and re&s;tored the bath or hot|as appears by the following in&s;cription, which was removed from hence to Cunnington, the hou&s;e of Sir Robert Cotton.

Here I mu&s;t correct their error, who by fal&s;ely copy|ing this in&s;cription read Balingium for Balineum, and thence form an opinion that the name of the place was Balingium; but upon a clo&s;e attention to the engra|ving
<PB N="8" REF="9">it is evidently Balineum, which word the learned know was u&s;ed for Balneum. In the declining &s;tate of the Roman empire a band of the exploratores, with their captain, kept their &s;tation here, under the com|mand of the General of Britain; as appears out of the Notice of Provinces, where it is called Lavatres. But as &s;uch baths as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e were al&s;o called in latin Lavacra, &s;ome critic will pronounce that this place was named Lavacra: but I would rather pre&s;ume it took its name from a little river running near to it, which I have heard is called Lavar.&mdash;As for the later name of Bowes, con&s;idering the old town had been burnt to the ground (as all the inhabitants report) I &s;hould think it aro&s;e upon that occa&s;ion, for that which is burnt in the old Briti&s;h language is called boeth.</Q></P>
<PB N="5" REF="6"></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">An other occa&s;ion, be&s;ides what is men|tioned by Camden, may have given the modern name of Bowes, as this place was granted by William the Conqueror to one of his attendant adventurers.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">The antient monuments, &s;aid by Cam|den to be in the church of Bowes, are
<PB N="8" REF="9">not now to be di&s;covered, neither are there any other antiquities there which can af|ford any light to the hi&s;tory of the place

<P><PB N="9" REF="10">From Bowes proceeding towards We&s;t|moreland, we were re&s;pited from the &s;ad &s;cene of barrenne&s;s to which we were obliged to pa&s;s, by &s;ome infant inclo|&s;ures, and attempts towards cultivation; &mdash;the climate, the dreary vicinage of<PB N="10" REF="11">mountains, and the inclement &s;kies, &s;eem to deny indu&s;try her natural rewards.</P>
<P>At length Spittle pre&s;ents its &s;olitary edifice to the view, behind which Stain|more ari&s;es; who&s;e heights receive the burthen of both ea&s;tern and we&s;tern &s;torms.&mdash;As we advanced, a dreary pro|&s;pect was extended to the eye; the hills are cloathed in heath, and all around is a &s;cene of barrenne&s;s and deformity;&mdash; the lower grounds are rent with torrents, which de&s;cend impetuou&s;ly from the &s;teeps in winter; and cha&s;ms, which are har|rowed on the &s;ides of the hills, yawn with ragged rocks, or black and rotten earth. &mdash;Here and there &s;ome &s;cattered plots of gra&s;s variegate the pro&s;pect, where a few &s;heep find pa&s;turage, and now and then a little rill is &s;een in the deep dell, which, as it flows with di&s;con&s;olate meandrings, is tinged with the &s;able &s;oil through
<PB N="11" REF="12">which it pa&s;&s;es.&mdash;No habitation for man|kind appears on either &s;ide, but all is wil|derne&s;s and horrid wa&s;te, over which the wearied eye travels with anxiety

<P>At the door of the turnpike hou&s;e on Stainmore &s;tands a cylindrical &s;tone, which &s;eems to have been a Roman guide po&s;t; but the in&s;cription is &s;o obliterated that it cannot now be made out. When we approached Roy Cro&s;s, mentioned by Camden
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Near to it is a fragment of a cro&s;s, which we call Rere Cro&s;s, the Scots Roy Cro&s;s, or King's Cro&s;s;

<PB N="11" REF="12"></NOTE>, which is now the boundary
<PB N="12" REF="13">&s;tone dividing York&s;hire from We&s;tmore|land, we perceived it &s;tood within the remains of a large entrenchment, de|fended by banks of earth ten paces wide, through which the pre&s;ent turnpike road now pa&s;&s;es. Its form is an oblong &s;quare, extending from north to &s;outh, with two openings on every &s;ide of the &s;quare, im|mediately oppo&s;ite to each other, defended by a mound of earth, placed right in the front of each pa&s;s, now ri&s;ing from the plane about five perpendicular feet, which is near the height of the entrenchment in its highe&s;t part.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">&mdash;The ea&s;tern &s;ide is two hundred and &s;eventy paces in length, the openings on the &s;ides are ten paces wide, the moles which defend the &s;ame are thirty-&s;ix paces in circumference, and &s;tand ten paces from the outward edge of the entrench|ment. The a&s;cent of the adjoining ground on this &s;ide is gradual for near half a mile.</P>
<P>&mdash;The northern end is two hundred and forty-nine paces in length, with two openings therein defended by moles of earth, &s;imilar to tho&s;e on the ea&s;tern quar|ter; and as the ground here is flat for a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, &s;o this part of the entrenchment was by nature rendered in|acce&s;&s;ible from the north by a deep mo|ra&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">&mdash;The we&s;tern &s;ide is &s;imilar to tho&s;e before de&s;cribed, being two hundred and &s;eventy-eight paces in length, &s;tanding on a &s;wift de&s;cent, which falls without in|termi&s;&s;ion for half a mile or upwards.</P>
<P>&mdash;The &s;outhern end is in length one hundred and eighty-one paces, has its openings and moles as before de&s;cribed, but &s;tands on the brink of a precipice of con&s;iderable height.&mdash;On the highe&s;t ground within the entrenchment is a large mound of earth, of a &s;quare figure, ari&s;ing from the plane near three perpendicular feet, and in circumference fifty-three paces.</P>
<P>We have no account of this entrench|ment in hi&s;tory, and are left to conjecture to what people it might belong.&mdash;As it lies on the Roman road, it &s;trikes one with an apprehen&s;ion that it was of
<PB N="15" REF="16">Roman original; but the &s;ingularity of the pa&s;&s;es and mounds which guard them, do not corre&s;pond with their u&s;ual mode of fortifying a camp; though the interior mound may be well e&s;teemed the praetorium. From the conflicts between the northern Engli&s;h and the Normans after the conque&s;t, and preceding Wil|liam's ceding Cumberland to the Scots, this place may be conceived to have been a camp of one of tho&s;e powers.</P>
<P>As we travelled from hence for &s;eve|ral miles, all around was one continued &s;cene of melancholy;&mdash;the hills encrea|&s;ing in height, the valleys deepning, and growing more de&s;olate;&mdash;the wind &s;ounded among&s;t the rocks, whil&s;t a hea|vy vapour in &s;ome parts clouded their &s;ummits; in others driving rain was &s;een &s;treaming along the dells, and &s;hrowding their gloomy rece&s;&s;es: &mdash; The wearied
<PB N="16" REF="17">mind of the Traveller endeavours to evade the&s;e objects, and plea&s;e it&s;elf with the fancied images of verdant plains, of &s;treams and happy groves, to which we were approaching.&mdash;Whil&s;t we were thus engaged, unexpectedly the &s;cene opened, and from &s;uch a horrid wild, gave us a pro&s;pect as delightful as the other was di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>Over a rugged and rocky foreground, we looked upon STAINMORE-DALE in front; her verdant meadows cheared the eye, her &s;weet &s;eque&s;tered cottages, her gra&s;&s;y plains, and little &s;hades of &s;yca|mores, &s;eemed enchanting, as their beau|ties were enhanced by the deformity from which they had e&s;caped. On the right hand a mountain ari&s;es, emer&s;ing its grey head and naked brow in clouds; the &s;ides are barren rocks, in who&s;e chinks here and there a few &s;hrubs are &s;een
<PB N="17" REF="18">clinging, and ca&s;t a teint of green to va|riegate the &s;torm-bleached precipice.&mdash; On a wild and forlorn &s;ituation, in an opening on the &s;ide of a mountain, HELL|BECK HALL is di&s;covered, covered with trees; the place &s;eems calculated for di&s;|content, and hidden from all that is chearful in the world, is befitted to a mind of di&s;appointment and de&s;pair; all its pro&s;pect is barrenne&s;s, the voice of water falls, of breezes mourning in the branches of the cop&s;e, or hi&s;&s;ing on the fi&s;&s;ures of the rock, its mu&s;ic; day-excluding &s;ha|dows make it gloomy, and over-hanging vapours damp and dreary.</P>
<P>&mdash; Yet Hellbeck has its beauties;&mdash;it contra&s;ts with the vale beneath, where the far out-&s;tretching plain reaches to the very bounds of Cumberland; who&s;e lofty mountains were &s;een from our then &s;ta|tion, tinged with blue vapours, and
<PB N="18" REF="19">mixing their &s;ummits with the &s;ky.&mdash;In the fore ground lays BROUGH, who&s;e an|tient ca&s;tle, formerly the &s;eat of Pem|brokes, affords a noble object; around which rich meadows dre&s;t in the brighte&s;t green and fre&s;h verdure after mowing, plots of ripening corn, &s;parkling &s;heets of water &s;een through the trees which deck their margins, the windings of each brook, little groves of a&s;h and &s;ycamore, fanta&s;tically di&s;per&s;ed and intermixed with villages and cots, form the beauties of the vale; on this hand extending to|wards Kirbv Steven, on that to Dufton, and in front as far as Penrith Beacon.</P>
<P>As we begun to de&s;cend the hill to|wards Brough, and leave Stainmore's de|&s;ert, we pa&s;&s;ed near an antient Roman fortification called MAIDEN CASTLE.&mdash; The Roman road has led immediately through it; it forms a &s;quare, and has
<PB N="19" REF="20">been built of &s;tone;&mdash;each &s;ide of this &s;quare is forty paces in length, and is defended by out-works; the neare&s;t being a &s;mall ditch with a brea&s;t-work of large &s;tones &s;et erect, and the outward one a ditch and mound of earth.&mdash;This place has been of great &s;trength in former times from its natural &s;ituation, com|manding the pa&s;s from Brough;&mdash;the a&s;|cent on the &s;ide oppo&s;ite to Brough is very &s;teep for upwards of a mile, to the &s;outh it is inacce&s;&s;ible by rea&s;on of the precipice on who&s;e brink it &s;tands, and towards the north the ground is every where rugged and mountainous
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Camden writes, that a little lower upon the Romans high &s;treet, there &s;tood a little fort of the Romans, built four &s;quare, which at this day they call Maiden Ca&s;tle; from whence, as the borderers reported, the way went with many windings in and out as far as Caer Vorrau in Northumberland.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21">The night was &s;pent at Brough.&mdash;Fa|tigue gives a reli&s;h beyond what the &s;ons of ea&s;e can po&s;&s;ibly experience in the mid&s;t of their luxury. Beds of down are only con&s;cious of anxiety and wearine&s;s to re&s;tle&s;s ambition and greatne&s;s. The pea&s;ant, breathing health from his la|bours, &s;leeps emparadi&s;ed on his bed of contentment and chaff.</P>
<P>BROUGH is now divided into two &s;mall mean towns, the one called Church Brough, the other Market Brough, &s;epa|rated by a little brook which falls into the River Eden.&mdash;Hu&s;bandry is very little advanced here; the management of gra&s;s land is the farmer's whole excellence, the meadows being kept in good order, and very wealthy.&mdash;The inhabitants are ig|norant of men and manners, but &s;ubtle and crafty.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">On parties of plea&s;ure time &s;hould ne|ver be limited;&mdash;to ride po&s;t through a country is too much the cu&s;tom of tra|vellers, by which they can reap no more than a general idea of it.&mdash;The &s;pecula|lative traveller is never confined to roads, times, or &s;ea&s;ons; but as the circum|&s;tances exciting his curio&s;ity lay either to the right or left, he pur&s;ues the objects of his attention, without regard to hours or rules.</P>
<P>The plea&s;antne&s;s of the morning called us very early from Brough;&mdash;the dawn advanced with a deep calm,&mdash;the clouds broke from the hills, and drew their grey veil from the face of morning, revealing her in blu&s;hes,&mdash;all the valley lay wrapped in &s;tillne&s;s;&mdash;care and indu&s;try had not departed from their night's rece&s;&s;es,&mdash;the ear was hu&s;hed, and all around &s;eemed to

<P>As we pur&s;ued our journey, at an open|ing of the road to the left we viewed the ruins of BROUGH CASTLE. In former times this was a formidable fortre&s;s, and &s;aid to be of Roman con&s;truction. The building to the ea&s;tern &s;ide is &s;emicircu|lar, and &s;eems to be of modern architec|ture; but to the we&s;t there remains a noble tower, apparently of great antiqui|ty, and built in the form and &s;tile of other Roman edifices in the north of Eng|land. The whole ca&s;tle &s;tands on a very con&s;iderable eminence, ari&s;ing &s;wiftly from the plain; and by its outworks &s;hews it to have been a place of great &s;trength.</P>

<P>The valley now growing more exten|&s;ive, encrea&s;ed its varieties, and plea&s;ed us with a new &s;cene of advancing culti|vation and hu&s;bandry. The large tracts of ground which we pa&s;t along, were lately common, but are now dividing and forming into inclo&s;ures.</P>
<P>At the &s;ixth mile-&s;tone, we &s;topped to admire the &s;ingularity of the view to the right, where a range of mountains, ari&s;ing

The &s;mall clouds which chequered the &s;ky, as they pa&s;&s;ed along, &s;pread their flitting &s;hadows on the di&s;tant mountains, and &s;eemed to marble them; a beauty which I do not recollect has &s;truck any painter, and which has not been de|&s;cribed even by the bold hand of the im|mortal

<P>APPLEBY, to which we now approach|ed, though placed on a very elevated &s;itua|tion, was concealed from our view till we arrived within half a mile; when from the hill which we had a&s;cended, it gave us an agreeable &s;urprize. On the brink of a lofty eminence, fronting towards the ea&s;t, at who&s;e foot runs the river Eden, the Ca&s;tle pre&s;ented it&s;elf.

Over this front the top of a fine &s;quare tower is di&s;covered, who&s;e cor|ners ari&s;e in turrets. The land&s;cape to the left is richly wooded;&mdash;to the right it is divided by hanging gardens which adjoin to the town, overtopped with the dwellings. The pavillions belonging to the hou&s;e of John Robin&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> with the parterres, and &s;loping plots of gra&s;s ground, modernize a &s;cene, which con|demns all factitiou&s;ne&s;s of ta&s;te; and by the &s;implicity and elegance, nature pre|&s;ents to us on the adjoining lands, re|proves the di&s;tortions which &s;he receives from dull right lines and angles;&mdash;but whil&s;t I cen&s;ure fa&s;hion, I revere the owner of the man&s;ion, who&s;e excellencies are too eminent to want the traveller's applau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33">As we approached the bridge, and ca&s;t our eyes up the valley, we were delighted with the happy a&s;&s;emblage of woods and meadows which form the little vale where the Eden flows.

<P>The pro&s;pect from the terrace which is under the ea&s;tern front of the ca&s;tle, is very beautiful;&mdash;to the right the river Eden forms a winding lake&punc; for the di&s;|tance of half a mile, who&s;e banks are cloathed with lofty hanging woods, de|&s;cending in a &s;wift but regular &s;weep to the brink of the &s;tream.

<P>The town of Appleby chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of one wide continued &s;treet, hanging upon the &s;wift decline of a hill, in a direction north and &s;outh; the ca&s;tle terminating it on the &s;ummit, the church at the foot. &mdash;The &s;ituation is delightful in the &s;um|mer &s;ea&s;on, but in the winter very cold; the natural di&s;advantages of its &s;cite be|ing encrea&s;ed by the great &s;earcity of coal; to &s;upply which want, wood and peats are chiefly u&s;ed as fuel.&mdash;The meadows
<PB N="39" REF="40">and pa&s;ture grounds are beautiful, but there is little tillage, it having been a re|ceived opinion for ages pa&s;t, that grain would not ripen or come to perfection &s;o near the moors and mountains, from whence a continued moi&s;t vapour is borne into the valley, which blights the corn in its blo&s;&s;om, or prevents it filling or maturing.

<P>&mdash;The northern window of the beacon kou&s;e affords a pro&s;pect of Cro&s;s Fell, with the Pikes of Dufton, together with a chain of mountains extending from ea&s;t

<P>&mdash;The ea&s;tern window pre&s;ented to us a view of the country we had pa&s;&s;ed, bounded by the hills of Stainmore, and the lofty promontary of Wilbore-fell above Kirby Stephen, with its neighbouring mountains.</P>
<P>&mdash;The &s;outh window returned to us the view of Brougham Ca&s;tle, with its plains of pa&s;ture ground.&mdash;The &s;preading woods of Lowther, intermixed with rich culti|vated lands, form the ri&s;ing grounds.&mdash; Some parts of the lake of Hull's-water are &s;een, whil&s;t the mighty rocks and moun|tains

<P>&mdash;The we&s;tern window affords a new, and not le&s;s plea&s;ing pro&s;pect;&mdash;the town of Penrith lay before us, and here and there the river Yeoman &s;hewed its wind|ings through its woods.&mdash;The hill which ri&s;es above the town is crowned with the awful remains of a royal fortre&s;s;&mdash;time has de&s;poiled its grandeur, but its Honors &s;till &s;urvive to its noble owner the Duke of Portland, who therewith holds the Ho|nor of Penrith, formerly a royal franchi&s;e. &mdash;Beyond the&s;e objects, among&s;t a range of mountains, at the di&s;tance of eighteen miles, Skiddow is &s;een, with his maje&s;|tic front, &s;urmounting all the high lands that terminate the view.</P>

<P>Our &s;econd excur&s;ion from Penrith was by LOWTHER to the LAKE of HULL's-WATER; &mdash;we pa&s;&s;ed the village of Clif|ton, memorable for the &s;kirmi&s;h on the 18th day of December, 1745, between the Duke of Cumberland's forces and the rebels.&mdash;On the approach to Clifton from Lowther, the way which the Duke's forces advanced, lies Clifton moor, a &s;pacious common de&s;cending with an ea&s;y &s;lope towards the village;&mdash;on the we&s;tern &s;ide of this moor the road is &s;ituate, within twenty yards of the inclo&s;ures, which are fenced by hedges and &s;tone walls, from whence the rebels begun firing on the Duke's hor&s;e, and made &s;ome &s;laughter; &mdash;to the ea&s;t the land de&s;cends to &s;ome &s;wamps, with &s;mall inclo&s;ures, at the foot

This being di&s;covered, one of the Duke's Hu&s;&s;ars, with great dexte|rity, attacked the hou&s;e, and riding round it, fired &s;everal &s;hot in at the window, which did &s;ome execution, and obliged Hamilton to &s;hew him&s;elf; when there began a &s;ingle combat, between two e|qually expert in hor&s;eman&s;hip and the u&s;e of arms; in which Hamilton was taken pri&s;oner, after giving and receiving many wounds.</P>
<P>&mdash;A train of melancholy &s;entiments flowed in upon the mind, on pa&s;&s;ing the

<P>We vi&s;ited the pre&s;ent works of Sir James Lowther, to which he is plea&s;ed to give the name of The Village; the build|ings of which are of &s;tone, hand&s;omely &s;a&s;hed, and covered with blue &s;late.&mdash; Our approach was at the ea&s;tern end, where the work there proceeding formed a cre&s;cent, behind which the other build|ings are thrown in &s;quares.&mdash;The de&s;ign on which the proprietor is building this beautiful place is, to entertain a number of linen manufacturers, the erections be|ing calculated for that purpo&s;e, with pro|per apartments for the directors and go|vernors
<PB N="58" REF="59">of &s;uch a work.&mdash;By the ap|pearance of the place, it &s;eems as if it would be capable of receiving a thou&s;and arti&s;ts.&mdash;The utility and greatne&s;s of this project are too manife&s;t to require the traveller's animadver&s;ions; enough it is to &s;ay, that &s;uch works, under the au&s;|piecs of &s;uch men, give the ob&s;erver in|finite plea&s;ure. The di&s;tances between the rich and poor, in this luxurious and proud age, have been too di&s;tinctly main|tained.&mdash;The wealth and felicity of this nation depends upon the intimate con|nection between property and trade.&mdash; Where opulence is diffu&s;ed in works to ble&s;s the indu&s;trious poor, in projects to promote manufactory and arts, panegy|ric is &s;ilenced by that inward approbation and e&s;teem, which leads the mind to re|gard &s;uch virtue, in the character of the rich man, with reverence.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60">&mdash;We pa&s;s'd along from this agreea|ble &s;cene to a place called the College, from its having been formerly the re&s;idence of the preceptors of the Lowther Family: where our admiration was enlarged by the princely works there carried on, at the &s;ole expence of Sir James.

<P>&mdash;The beauties of the pro&s;pect at
<PB N="62" REF="63">A&s;kam Bridge engaged our attention&mdash; the water de&s;cending over a rockey chan|nel, fell in irregular and foaming &s;treams; &mdash;the little plain above was dre&s;&s;ed in the brighte&s;t green; the lofty banks on every hand were cloathed with &s;tately oaks, &s;ave only where a bold promontary, which overhung the road where we had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;hewed its rocky brow from out the &s;hade which crowned its threatning front.</P>
<P>A gentleman who was &s;o obliging as accompany us in this day's excur&s;ion, conducted our rout with great judgment; &mdash;from Lowther, he cau&s;ed us to a&s;cend the hills, which bordered upon Hulls'-water; &s;o that the Lake was totally con|cealed from us in our approach till we were ju&s;t upon it.</P>
<P>&mdash;Having attained the &s;ummit, with
<PB N="63" REF="64">no &s;mall degree of patience and fatigue, it opened &s;uddenly upon our view, pre|&s;enting to us a &s;heet of water of the form of an <HI>S,</HI> nine miles in extent, and greatly above a mile in width;&mdash;as we looked upon it from a great eminence, we could di&s;cern all its bays, its &s;hores and promontaries, and in the exten&s;ive land&s;cape take in a va&s;t variety of objects, thrown together with all that beauty, which wood and water, lawns, ri&s;ing &s;weeps of corn, villas, vil|lages, and cots, &s;urmounted by immen&s;e mountains and rude cliffs can form to the eye;&mdash;the country to the right for many miles was variegated in the fine&s;t man|ner by enclo&s;ures, woods and villas; among&s;t which Gray&s;tock, Dacre, and Delmain were &s;een, whil&s;t to the left nothing but &s;tupendous mountains and rude projecting rocks pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the &s;ight vying with each other, for grandeur and eminence.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65">We de&s;cended to the village of POOLEY, and from thence, by a winding road on the margin of the Lake, pa&s;&s;ed on for near a mile, to a &s;mall inn where we left our hor&s;es.</P>
<P>We were accommodated on the water with one of the barges belonging to the Duke of Portland, which have been &s;ent there by his Grace for plea&s;uring;&mdash;a &s;trong &s;outh breeze rendered the Lake &s;o rough, that the &s;urf broke over the bow, whil&s;t the &s;well gave us motion almo&s;t equal to that felt at &s;ea;&mdash;my companion; &s;uffered no &s;mall mortification by this accident, at it incommoded him much in drawing views of this admirable &s;cene. &mdash;We were obliged to coa&s;t it up the Lake, to keep as much under the wind as po&s;&s;ible, the labour being very great to
<PB N="65" REF="66">make any way, with four boat-men at the oars.</P>
<P>&mdash;As we took the boat, there &s;tood to our right, a mountain almo&s;t perfectly circular, covered with verdure to the crown, ari&s;ing &s;wiftly from the edge of the water many hundred feet in height, and &s;hadowing us from the &s;un;&mdash;to the left the Lake &s;pread out its agitated bo&s;om, whitened with innumerable brea|kers, much above a mile in breadth; who&s;e oppo&s;ite &s;hore in one part a&s;cended gradually with cultivated lands from the village of Pooley, &s;kirting the hills; over which &s;ome &s;cattered wood was happily di&s;po&s;ed in irregular groves and winding lines; whil&s;t all above, the brown heath reached the &s;ummits.&mdash;This land adjoined to a mountain much &s;uperior in height to that upon our right, ri&s;ing almo&s;t per|pendicular from the Lake, with naked
<PB N="66" REF="67">cliffs: on its rugged &s;ide, through the grey rocks, was torn a pa&s;&s;age for a ri|vulet, who&s;e waters fell precipitate with a mighty noi&s;e into the deep below;&mdash;the ground more di&s;tant, which was &s;een &s;till upwards, over an expan&s;e of water not le&s;s than four miles, con&s;i&s;ted of lofty rocks and bold promontaries, here and there &s;hewing naked and &s;torm-bleached cliffs; and in other places &s;cattered over with the &s;pring of young oaks, ari&s;ing from the &s;toves of trees which the ax had lately &s;lain.&mdash;We could not forbear la|menting the lo&s;s of &s;o great an ornament to this romantic &s;cene, as a fore&s;t of timber trees hanging on the&s;e declivities mu&s;t have been, from this and every other point of view on the Lake.</P>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed along, having doubled two &s;mall capes, we fell into a bay, under the &s;eat of John Robin&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of
<PB N="67" REF="68">WATER MELLOCK.&mdash;From the very margin of the Lake, in this part, the gra&s;s ground a&s;cended gradually in an ea&s;y &s;lope, where were di&s;per&s;ed, in an agreeable irregularity, pretty groves of a&s;h: there
<Q><L>&mdash;Many a glade is found,</L>
<L>The haunt of wood gods only, where if art</L>

<P>&mdash;Above which the ea&s;y inclining hills &s;hewed us yellow fields of corn, over|topped by the white front of a venerable man&s;ion, more noted for its ho&s;pitality, than for the elegance of its &s;tructure.</P>
<P>&mdash;The plea&s;antne&s;s of this bay, the ver|dure of the new-mown meads, with the &s;hade of the grove, induced us to take our noon-tide repa&s;t there.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69">&mdash;Whil&s;t we &s;at to regale, the barge put off from &s;hore, to a &s;tation where the fine&s;t echoes were to be obtained from the &s;urrounding mountains.&mdash;The ve&s;&s;el was provided with &s;ix bra&s;s cannon, mounted on &s;wivels;&mdash;on the di&s;charge of one of the&s;e pieces, the report was echoed from the oppo&s;ite rocks, where by reverberation it &s;eemed to roll from cliff to cliff, and return through every cave and valley; till the decrea&s;ing tumult gradually died away upon the ear.</P>
<P>&mdash;The in&s;tant it had cea&s;ed the &s;ound of every di&s;tant water-fall was heard, but for an in&s;tant only; for the momentary &s;tillne&s;s was interrupted by returning echo on the hills behind us; where the report was repeated like a peal of thunder bur&s;t|ing over our heads, continuing for &s;eve|ral &s;econds, flying from haunt to haunt,
<PB N="69" REF="70">till once more the &s;ound gradually decli|ned;&mdash;again the voice of water-falls po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the interval,&mdash;till to the right the more di&s;tant thunder aro&s;e upon &s;ome other mountain, and &s;eemed to take its way up every winding dell and creek, &s;ometimes behind, on this &s;ide, or on that, in wondrous &s;peed, running its dreadful cour&s;e;&mdash;when the echo reached the mountains within the line and channel of the breeze, it was heard at once on the right hand and left, at the extremi|ties of the Lake.&mdash;In this manner was the report of every di&s;charge re-echoed &s;even times di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>&mdash;At intervals we were relieved from this entertainment, which con&s;i&s;ted of a kind of wondrous tumult and grandeur of confu&s;ion, by the mu&s;ic of two French horns, who&s;e harmony was repeated from every rece&s;s which echo haunted on the
<PB N="70" REF="71">borders of the Lake;&mdash;here the breathings of the organ were imitated, there the ba&s;|&s;oon with clarinets;&mdash;in this place from the har&s;her &s;ounding cliffs, the cornet;&mdash; in that from the wooded creek, among&s;t the caverns and the trilling water falls, you &s;eemed to hear the &s;o&s;t-toned lute ac|companied with the langui&s;hing &s;trains of enamoured nymphs; whil&s;t in the cop&s;e and grove was &s;till retained the mu&s;ic of the horns.&mdash;All this va&s;t theatre, &s;eemed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by innumerable aerial beings, who breathed coele&s;tial har|mony.</P>
<P>&mdash;As we fini&s;hed our repa&s;t, from a general di&s;charge of the guns we were rou&s;ed to new a&s;toni&s;hment; for altho' we had heard with great &s;urprize the for|mer echoes, this exceeded them &s;o much that it &s;eemed incredible: for on every
<PB N="71" REF="72">hand the &s;ounds were reverberated and returned from &s;ide to &s;ide, &s;o as to give us the &s;emblance of that confu&s;ion and horrid uproar, which the falling of the&s;e &s;tupendous rocks would occa&s;ion, if by &s;ome internal combu&s;tion they were rent to pieces, and hurled into the Lake.</P>
<P>During the time of our repa&s;t the wind was hu&s;hed, and the Lake, which on our fir&s;t entrance was troubled and foaming, now became like a &s;hining mirror, reflect|ing rever&s;ed mountains and rocks, groves, meads, and vales;&mdash;the water was &s;o tran&s;parent that we could perceive the fi&s;h and pebbles at the depth of &s;ix or eight fathom;&mdash;we now doubled a woody promontary, and pa&s;&s;ing by the foot of Gobery Park, a&s;cended into the narrow part of the Lake, leaving the gra&s;&s;y mar|gins and the &s;cattered cop&s;e, which had bordered the water, as we pa&s;t by Wa|ter

<P>&mdash;The &s;cene was nobly awful as we approached to STARBURY CRAG;&mdash;at every winding of our pa&s;&s;age, new hills and rocks were &s;een to overlook tho&s;e which had but the minute before been new upon our pro&s;pect; the clouds hung heavily upon the mountains, rolling in gloomy volumes over their heads, in
<PB N="73" REF="74">&s;ome places dragging their ragged &s;kirts along the &s;ides of the &s;teeps, giving them a deep and melancholy &s;hade; in others admitting the &s;un beams, which illumi|nated the winding dells with a greyi&s;h light.</P>
<P>&mdash;We &s;aw within &s;ome little di&s;tance of the &s;hore a &s;ulphurine &s;pring.&mdash;We were &s;orry to find this valuable gift of nature remained unanalized and neglected by the neighbouring gentlemen; it ap|peared to be much of the nature of Har|rowgate Spaw, and is &s;aid to have &s;hewn excellent medicinal qualities to tho&s;e who have u&s;ed it.</P>
<P>&mdash;The fi&s;hermen belonging to Mr Ro|bin&s;on were &s;o obliging as to make us two draughts; but we were not fortunate enough to take any very large fi&s;h;&mdash; we drew trout, perch, and &s;kelley,

<P>&mdash;After a voyage of upwards nine miles we returned, pa&s;&s;ing down the cen|tre of the Lake. We had again arrived oppo&s;ite to the woody promontary, which joins to the extreme of the cultivated lands of Water Mellock, when the view down the Lake opened upon us.</P>
<P>&mdash;The meadows, the groves, the moun|tains, and the rocks, which environed the Lake, were di&s;po&s;ed in the mo&s;t picture&s;que order, bending around the margin of an expan&s;e of water of five miles over;&mdash;the lands of Water Mel|lock now layed at a di&s;tance to the left,

<P>&mdash;We hung upon our oars &s;ome time, reluctant to quit this pro&s;pect, and enjoy|ing the mu&s;ic of the horns;&mdash;the exqui|&s;ite &s;oftne&s;s and harmony which the echoes produced here, were not to be de|&s;cribed;&mdash;the mu&s;ic &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from &s;ome re&s;ounding temple, which &s;tood

<P>&mdash;It happened fortunately for us that the &s;un &s;ome &s;hort time before &s;etting, &s;hone out &s;erene;&mdash;we made a little turn to look back upon the dark and rocky &s;cene which we had pa&s;&s;ed, when the vapour which had for &s;ome time almo&s;t covered the mountains with a gloomy veil, appeared to roll up upon the breeze like a mighty curtain, and withdrew, opening gradually to the eye the pompous theatre.&mdash;No &s;ooner were the&s;e cumbrous volumes lifted above the &s;ummits of the we&s;tern hills, than the horizontal rays

<HEAD><HI>Dr</HI> BROWN's LETTER, <HI>printed at</HI> NEWCASTLE <HI>in the year</HI> 1767.</HEAD>
<P>In my way to the north from Hagley, I pa&s;&s;ed through Dovedale; and to &s;ay the truth, was di&s;appointed in it. When I came to Buxton, I vi&s;ited another or two of their romantic &s;cenes: but the&s;e are inferior to Dovedale. They are but poor miniatures of Ke&s;wick; which ex|ceeds them more in grandeur than I can give you to imagine, and more if po&s;&s;ible in beauty than in grandeur.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of the narrow &s;lip of valley which is &s;een at Dovedale, you have at Ke&s;wick a va&s;t amphitheatre, in circumference above twenty miles. In&s;tead of a meagre rivulet, a noble living Lake, ten miles round, of an oblong form, adorned with variety of wooded i&s;lands. The rocks indeed of Dovedale are finely wild, pointed,
<PB N="109" REF="110">and irregular; but the hills are both little and unani|mated; and the margin of the brook is poorly edged with weeds, mora&s;s, and bru&s;hwood. But at Ke&s;wick, you will on one &s;ide of the Lake, &s;ee a rich and beauti|ful land&s;kip of cultivated fields, ri&s;ing to the eye in fine inequalities, with noble groves of oak, happily di&s;per&s;ed; and climbing the adjacent hills, &s;hade above &s;hade, in the mo&s;t various and picture&s;que forms. On the mo&s;t op|po&s;ite &s;hore, you will find rocks and cliffs of &s;tupendous height, hanging broken over the Lake in horrible grandeur, &s;ome of them a thou&s;and feet high, the woods climbing up their &s;teep and &s;haggy &s;ides, where mortal foot never yet approached. On the&s;e dreadful heights the eagles build their ne&s;ts: A variety of waterfalls are &s;een pouring from their &s;ummits, and tumbling in va&s;t &s;heets from rock to rock in rude and terrible magnifi|cence: While on all &s;ides of this immen&s;e amphitheatre the lofty mountains ri&s;e round, piercing the clouds in &s;hapes as &s;piry and fanta&s;tic, as the very rocks of Dove|dale. To this I mu&s;t add the frequent and bold projec|tion of the cliffs into the Lake, forming noble bays and
<PB N="110" REF="111">promontories: In other parts they finely retire from it, and often open in abrupt ca&s;ms or clefts, through which at h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d, you &s;ee rich and cultivated vales, and beyond the&s;e at various di&s;tance, mountains ri&s;ing over mountains; among which, new pro&s;pects pre&s;ent them&s;elves in mi&s;t, till the eye is lo&s;t in an agreeable perplexity:
<Q><L>Where active fancy travels beyond &s;en&s;e,</L>
<L>And pictures things un&s;een.</L></Q></P>
<P>Were I to analy&s;e the two places into their con&s;tituent principles, I &s;hould tell you that the full perfection of Ke&s;wick con&s;i&s;ts of three circum&s;tances, beauty, horror, and immen&s;ity united; the &s;econd of which is alone found in Dovedale. Of beauty it hath little: Nature having left it almo&s;t a de&s;art: Neither its &s;mall extent, nor the diminutive and livele&s;s form of the hills admit magnificence. But to give you a complete idea of the&s;e three perfections, as they are joined in Ke&s;wick, would require the united powers of Claude, Salvator, and Pou&s;&s;in. The fir&s;t &s;hould throw his delicate &s;un&s;hine over the cultivated vales, the &s;cattered cots, the groves, the Lake, and wooded i&s;lands. The &s;econd &s;hould da&s;h out the horror of the rugged cliffs, the &s;teeps, the hang|ing
<PB N="111" REF="112">woods; and foaming waterfalls; while the grand pencil of Pou&s;&s;in &s;hould crown the whole with the Ma|je&s;ty of the impending mountains.</P>
<P>So much for what I would call the permanent beau|ties of this a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cene. Were I not afraid of being tire&s;ome, I could now dwell as long on its varying or accidental beauties. I would &s;ail round the Lake, anchor in every bay, and land you on every promontory and i&s;land. I would point the perpetual change of pro&s;|pect; the woods, rocks, cliffs, and mountains, by turns vani&s;hing or ri&s;ing into view: Now gaining on the &s;ight, hanging over our heads in their full dimen&s;ions, beautifully dreadful; and now, by a change of &s;itua|tion, a&s;&s;uming new romantic &s;hapes, retiring and le&s;&s;en|ing on the eye, in&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;ing them&s;elves in an azure mi&s;t. I would remark the contra&s;t of light and &s;hade, produced by the morning and evening &s;un; the one gilding the we&s;tern, and the other the ea&s;tern &s;ide of this immen&s;e amphitheatre; while the va&s;t &s;hadow projected by the mountains buries the oppo&s;ite part in a deep and purple gloom, which the eye can hardly penetrate. The natural variety of colouring which the &s;everal objects
<PB N="112" REF="113">produce is no le&s;s wonderful and plea&s;ing: The ruling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nts in the valley being tho&s;e of azure, green, and gold, yet ever various, ari&s;ing from an intermixture of the Lake, the woods, the gra&s;s and corn fields: The&s;e are finely contra&s;ted by the grey rocks and cliffs; and the whole beightened by the yellow &s;treams of light, the purple hues, and mi&s;ty azure of the mountains. Some|times a &s;erene air and clear &s;ky di&s;clo&s;e the tops of the highe&s;t hills; at others, you &s;ee clouds involving their &s;ummits, re&s;ting on their &s;ides, or de&s;cending to their ba&s;e, and rolling among the vallies, as in a va&s;t furnace. &mdash;When the winds are high, they roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder; then, too, the clouds are &s;een in va&s;t bodies &s;weeping along the hills in gloomy greatne&s;s, while the Lake joins the tumult, and to&s;&s;es like a &s;ea: But in calm weather the whole &s;cene becomes new; the Lake is a perfect mirror; and the land&s;kip in all its beauty, i&s;lands, fields, woods, rocks, and mountains, are &s;een inverted, and floating on its &s;urface. I will now carry you to the top of a cliff, where, if you dare approach the ridge, a new &s;cene of a&s;toni&s;hment pre&s;ents it&s;elf; where the valley, Lake, and i&s;lands, &s;eem lying at your feet; where this expan&s;e of water ap|pears
<PB N="113" REF="114">dimini&s;hed to a little pool, amid&s;t the va&s;t immea|&s;urable objects that &s;urround it; for here the &s;ummits of more di&s;tant hills appear above tho&s;e you have already &s;een, and ri&s;ing behind each other in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ranges, and azure groups of craggy and broken &s;teeps, form an immen&s;e and awful picture, which can only be expre&s;&s;ed by the image of a tempe&s;tuous &s;ea of mountains.&mdash;Let me now conduct you down again to the valley, and conclude with one circum&s;tance more; which is, that a walk by &s;till moon light (at which time the di&s;tant waterfalls are heard in all their variety of &s;ound) among the&s;e inchanting dales, opens a &s;cene of &s;uch delicate beauty, repo&s;e, and &s;olemnity, as exceeds all de&s;cription.</P>

<P>&mdash;We now pu&s;hed up the river which feeds the Lake, and anchored near a little but plea&s;ant habitation, called LOCHDOOR, or LODORE; a place per|fectly adapted for the abode of a reclu&s;e,

<P>&mdash;Mi&s;ts began to ari&s;e on the Lake, and by rea&s;on of the air which bore them aloft, being confined and eddying with|in this deep circle, they were whirled round, and carried upwards like a column, which &s;o &s;oon as it approached the rays of the moon, had a mo&s;t wonderful ap|pearance, and re&s;embled a pillar of light.</P>

<P>&mdash;The moon's mild beams now gli&s;tned on the waters, and touched the groves, the cliffs, and i&s;lands, with a meekne&s;s of colouring, which added to the &s;olemnity of the night, and the&s;e noble and ro|mantic objects, &s;truck us with reverence and in&s;pired the mind with pious &s;enti|ments and ejaculations.&mdash;It was ob&s;erva|ble, that by day we were ince&s;&s;antly com|municating our raptures and &s;urpri&s;e on each new wonder that opened to our view,&mdash;we now enjoyed them in &s;ilence.</P>

<PB N="155" REF="156">dells which wind around the feet of the mountains, as they were &s;hadowed by in|terpo&s;ing objects, or &s;ilvered by the moon, afforded mo&s;t enchanting &s;cenes; where we might have wandered with delight through the whole night.</P>
<P>&mdash;Where the Lake narrows, and runs up in a creek towards BORODALE, the rocks looked horrible, almo&s;t &s;hutting us in from the face of heaven, which could be beheld only by looking immediately upright; the cliffs were &s;truck with &s;canty gleams of light, which gained their pa&s;|&s;age through the inter&s;tices of the hills, or cha&s;ms in the rocks, and &s;erved only to di&s;cover their tremendous overhanging fronts; their mighty caverns, where the water &s;truck by our oars made a hollow &s;ound, their deformed and frowning brows, the hanging &s;hrubs with which they were bearded, their &s;parkling water|falls

<P>&mdash;The air was remarkably &s;harp and thin, compared with that from which we pa&s;&s;ed in the valley; and re&s;piration &s;eemed to be performed with a kind of a&s;thmatic oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<PB N="159" REF="160">&mdash;The clouds advanced towards us with accelerated &s;peed;&mdash;a hollow bla&s;t &s;ound|ed among&s;t the hills and dells which lay below us, and &s;eemed to fly from the approaching darkne&s;s;&mdash;the vapour rol|led down the oppo&s;ite valley of Newland, and appeared to tumble in mighty &s;heets and volumes from the brow of each mountain, into the vale of Ke&s;wick, and over the Lakes.</P>
<P>&mdash;Whil&s;t we &s;tood to admire this phe|nomenon the mighty volumes of clouds which we beheld below us gradually a&s;|cended, and we &s;oon found the &s;ummit of Skiddow totally &s;urrounded, whil&s;t we on every &s;ide looked down upon an angry and impetuous &s;ea, heaving its billows, as if boiling from the bottom; we were rejoicing in this grand &s;pectacle of nature, and thinking our&s;elves fortu|nate in having beheld &s;o extraordinary

<PB N="161" REF="162">the whole mountain, and letting fall a heavy &s;hower of rain;&mdash;we thought our&s;elves happy even under this circum|&s;tance, to perceive the &s;torm turning northwe&s;tward, and to hear the next thunderclap bur&s;t in the plain beyond Ba&s;net water.&mdash;A like event has frequent|ly happened to travellers in the heights of the Alps, from whence the thunder &s;torms are &s;een pa&s;&s;ing over the countries beneath them.</P>
<P>&mdash;The echoes from the mountains which bordered Ke&s;wick Lake, from Newland, from Borodale, from Lodore, were noble, and gave a repetition of the thunder-claps di&s;tinctly, though di&s;tant, after an intermi&s;&s;ion of &s;everal &s;econds tremendous &s;ilence.</P>
<P>&mdash;The rain, which &s;till encrea&s;ed, for|med innumerable &s;treams and ca&s;cades,
<PB N="162" REF="163">which ru&s;hed from the crown of Skiddow, Saddle-back, and Caw&s;ey-pike, with a mighty noi&s;e; but we were deprived of the beauty of the&s;e waterfalls by the in|tercepting vapour, which was not to be penetrated by the eye more than a few yards before us.</P>
<P>&mdash;We de&s;cended the hill wet and fa|tigued, and were happy when we re|gained our inn at Ke&s;wick; which we now e&s;teemed a paradi&s;e, although we had de&s;pi&s;ed it before for its dirtine&s;s and inconvenience.</P>
<P>We took leave of our &s;lovenly and be&s;otted ho&s;t, and pur&s;ued our rout from Ke&s;wick to AMBLESIDE, a &s;tage of eigh|teen miles.</P>
<P>&mdash;For romantic, mountainous, and wild &s;cenes, this &s;tage affords the fine&s;t
<PB N="163" REF="164">ride in the north of England; the whole road lying in a narrow and winding dell, confined by a &s;tupendous range of moun|tains on either hand.&mdash;In &s;ome places the vale is not wider than merely to admit the road, in other places it opens in little valleys, and again is &s;hut in various forms.&mdash;We pa&s;&s;ed near the rocks of ST JOHN's, which on nearer view lo&s;t mo&s;t of their grote&s;que appearance; and as we winded by the feet of the&s;e lofty hills, creeks filled with wood afforded us many pretty, though narrow land&s;kips; through which little rills, ari&s;ing on the &s;ides of the mountains, poured down their ha&s;ty and gurgling waters.&mdash;The rain which had fallen the day before improved the beauties of the place;&mdash;the ca&s;cades were innumerable, and their fi|gures various;&mdash;at one point of view we took in nine ca&s;cades, falling from emi|nences &s;even or eight hundred feet per|pendicular
<PB N="164" REF="165">height;&mdash;where &s;ome of them fell from the very brows of the hills, they appeared as &s;trings of &s;ilver, but de&s;cend|ing further &s;pread into &s;heets of foam, and, before they reached the middle of the hills, tumbled headlong from preci|pice to precipice, with a confu&s;ed noi&s;e. &mdash;Every turn of the road, and every val|ley, gave us a new &s;cene;&mdash;the pro&s;pects were ever changing and diver&s;ified.</P>
<P>At length we reached a narrow Lake, called LAYS-WATER, where the vale widened;&mdash;&s;cattered trees and &s;ome little inclo&s;ures adorned its margin, and here and there a cottage.&mdash;We rode by the &s;ide of this Lake for the di&s;tance of two miles, &s;o far it &s;tretched along the vale, on every hand enjoying little rural &s;cenes, which renewing to us a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pa&s;|toral images which we had collected from
<PB N="165" REF="166">the poets in our early years, when the young mind was charmed with romance, and the mo&s;t fanta&s;tic ideas of rural in|nocence, retirement, and love.</P>
<P>&mdash;Neither did the&s;e images pa&s;s in the imagination only, for in this &s;eque&s;tered vale we met with a female native full of youth, innocence, and beauty;&mdash;&s;impli|city adorned her looks with mode&s;ty, and hid her down-ca&s;t eye; virgin apprehen|&s;ion covered her with blu&s;hes, when &s;he found her&s;elf &s;tayed by two &s;trangers; and as &s;he turned her eyes for an in&s;tant upon us, they &s;mote us with all the energy of unaffected innocence, touched with doubtfulne&s;s;&mdash;her lips, which in the &s;weete&s;t terms expre&s;&s;ed her apprehen|&s;ion, &s;hewed us teeth of ivory; and on her full forehead ringlets of auburn flowed carele&s;sly: a delicacy of proportion was
<PB N="166" REF="167">&s;een over her whole figure, which was ea&s;y and elegant as nature's &s;elf.</P>
<P>&mdash;My companion, in a rapture, &s;natch|ed out his pencil, and began to imitate; but the unaffected impatiency, and &s;weet confu&s;ion of the maid, overcame our wi&s;hes to detain her, and we let her pa&s;s reluctantly.</P>
<P>After this little adventure we jogged on, &s;ilent, and wraped up each in his own cogitations, till we began to de&s;cend the hill towards the valley of GRASMERE; &mdash;we were rou&s;ed by the unexpected beauties of the &s;cene, and, as if moved by one thought, we &s;topped, gazed at each and &s;miled, before we could conde&s;cend to &s;natch our&s;elves from the ideal plea&s;ures we had been enjoying.&mdash;We were each con&s;cious of our &s;ituation, and at length
<PB N="167" REF="168">laughed aloud; no otherwi&s;e communi|cating our &s;entiments but by our looks, which &s;ufficiently explained our &s;impathe|tic and &s;ilent delight.</P>
<P>We were charmed with the view of GRASMERE, a retirement &s;urrounded by hills on every hand; the vale is about four miles in circumference, of meadow and pa&s;ture ground;&mdash;near the middle of this valley is a fine Lake, beautified with an i&s;land.&mdash;From a mount a little di&s;tance from the church we viewed the whole cir|cle, delighted with the &s;ituation;&mdash;the fields were full of fre&s;hne&s;s and verdure, the &s;cene was ornamented with a few humble cottages di&s;per&s;ed on the borders of the Lake, among&s;t which the &s;acred fane &s;tood &s;olemnly &s;uperior;&mdash;the hills were here and there graced with a few
<PB N="168" REF="169">trees, and animated by white flocks of &s;heep.&mdash;It &s;eemed to be the vale of peace.</P>
<P>We had not pa&s;&s;ed far from this &s;weet &s;eque&s;tered &s;cene before we entered RI|DALE, where we were again charmed with new retreats, and happy retirements.</P>
<P>&mdash;Here we found a cultivated vale, not equal in width to Gra&s;mere, but full of pretty inclo&s;ures, and watered with a Lake, on which a fine woody i&s;land ari&s;es.&mdash;We pa&s;&s;ed along the windings of this dale, till we reached the &s;eat of Sir Michael Fleming,&mdash;an ancient man|&s;ion, &s;tanding on the opening of the dale, on the &s;outhern decline of the hills, which abound in wood land, and front to the Lake of WINDERMERE.&mdash;The ground before this &s;eat is prettily diver|&s;ified with irregular knots of trees, &s;ituate
<PB N="169" REF="170">on natural eminences, and &s;cattered with &s;uch agreeable wildne&s;s and irregularity, that they &s;eemed to be the work of na|ture;&mdash;the inter&s;paces between the&s;e knots of trees were mown in narrow meandring walks
