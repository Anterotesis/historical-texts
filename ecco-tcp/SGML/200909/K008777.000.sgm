<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>FOR Two Millions of People to re|nounce a &s;olemn Oath, &mdash; to change the Government of Thirteen exten&s;ive Provinces, &mdash; to wage War with the mo&s;t formidable Power of the Univer&s;e, are Ob|jects than which it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to con|ceive any more important, or in which it can be more nece&s;&s;ary that Con&s;cience, &s;ound Policy, and Prudence, &s;hould have a fair Hearing.</P>
<P>In all free Governments it is u&s;ual that the Rulers give an A&s;&s;urance, upon Oath, that they will rule according to Law, and they that are ruled, that they will pay Obedience according to Law unto their Rulers. &mdash; It is evident that the Obligation is reciprocal; but what is to be done, when a Failure is charged
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
upon Ruler or Subject, and either or both Parties plead that they act &s;trictly according to the Con&s;titution acknowledged by both, is a very arduous Que&s;tion; and whether, up|on the Suppo&s;ition that the Con&s;titution has not been aboli&s;hed, but wounded by tho&s;e in Power, Subjects are entirely di&s;charged from Allegiance; or, in other Words, becau&s;e the King, or Legi&s;lature, did <HI>one</HI> illegal Act, Sub|jects may renounce all Dependence on them for ever, may de&s;erve a peculiar Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent unhappy Di&s;pute has this very di&s;agreeable Circum&s;tance attending it&mdash;That it is not a Que&s;tion between Crown and Sub|ject, Nobles and King, an Upper Hou&s;e and a Lower; but that all the Branches of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Legi&s;lature act in Concert. Formerly the Barons took Part with the Crown, or Commons, as be&s;t &s;uited their own Intere&s;t. Sometimes the Commons may have en|croached on the Prerogative, as that has too often on the Liberty of the Subject; but no In&s;tance readily occurs to me, where the three Branches of the Legi&s;lature, and an exten&s;ive Part, not of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Realms, but of the Empire, were the contending Parties.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the Sen&s;e and Re&s;olu|tion of a Community, as to the pre&s;ent Force
<PB N="v" REF="4">
of an Oath taken at any Time by them, I apprehend (as every Man is to give an Ac|count of him&s;elf to God) no Man can be con|&s;cientiou&s;ly freed from the Obligation, but by the Conviction of his own Con&s;cience, that the Oath he once took is no longer binding. The Man that renounces an Oath lightly, makes very free with God Almighty and him&s;elf; and the Man that acts contrary to what, in his Con&s;cience, he thinks &s;till bind|ing, will, at &s;ome Time or other, find it difficult to clear him&s;elf from &s;ome very heavy Charge.</P>
<P>To alter the general Plan of Government in an Extent of Fifteen Hundred Miles; to take away the Center-Stone, by which it was hitherto cemented, is a great Undertaking; and upon the Suppo&s;ition of its being ju&s;t, prudent, and nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o many Circum|&s;tances will be found to be con&s;idered, and &s;o many different Objects and Intere&s;ts to be adju&s;ted, that I &s;hould be tempted to think him a very ha&s;ty Man, who would take large Strides and little Time in &s;o important a Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>As to being at War with <HI>Great Britain</HI> I do not wonder; it is rather a plea&s;ing Con|&s;ideration to &s;uch as delight in War, and
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
place Virtue in perpetual Hatred and Re&s;ent|ment. Mo&s;t certainly a Man can think him|&s;elf in no Danger, "with a Force &s;ufficient to repel all the World;" neither do I wonder that &s;ome Men think "a Twentieth Part of the Strength of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Navy would be a great Over-match for the Whole;" but I really do wonder that the Author of <HI>Com|mon Sen&s;e</HI> acknowledges the <HI>Americans</HI> have not this Twentieth Part,&mdash;and yet he &s;eriou&s;ly advi&s;es them to engage in a Sea War.</P>
<P>It &s;eems &s;urprizing, that a Propo&s;al of In|dependency &s;hould pa&s;s unanim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">verted; the Remarks here offered are &s;ome of the weaker Things that can be &s;aid again&s;t this Scheme; this is not a Time to &s;et &s;ome &s;tronger Ar|guments again&s;t it in the fulle&s;t Light; the mo&s;t effectual An&s;wer to that boa&s;ted Per|formance has been given by the Congre&s;s of <HI>South Carolina,</HI> in the E&s;tabli&s;hment of a temporary Con&s;titution, which may well be con&s;idered as the Counter-Part of the Plan offered by the Author of <HI>Common Sen&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Hints are &s;ubmitted to public View, to try whether they may be as &s;erviceable, as &s;ome, for who&s;e Judgment the Author has a Regard, &s;eem to expect. The Author al|ways profe&s;&s;ed, as he now does, a firm Per|&s;ua&s;ion,
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
that the Acts which gave Ri&s;e to the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute are illegal and oppre&s;&s;ive; he has no Intimacy with, nor indeed is he ac|quainted with, a &s;ingle Per&s;on that would take upon him their Defence; he is well per|&s;uaded, that the Mea&s;ures taken by the Con|tinental Congre&s;s mu&s;t en&s;ure them the Prai&s;es of Nations, and of tho&s;e yet unborn; he heartily wi&s;heth every Man may exert him&s;elf in a proper Manner in &s;o great a Cau&s;e, and thinks it would be for the Be|nefit of <HI>America,</HI> if tho&s;e who cannot go the &s;ame Length with others, while they wi&s;h to &s;ee <HI>America</HI> redre&s;&s;ed, might be treated with Tenderne&s;s, and be made u&s;eful to the Cau&s;e, con&s;i&s;tent with their own Principles. He looks upon an entire Separation from <HI>Great Britain</HI> not as a la&s;t Remedy, but as a new and more dangerous Di&s;ea&s;e; and ear|ne&s;tly prays that <HI>America,</HI> in that Con|nexion, may &s;oon, and for ever enjoy that Con&s;titution and Freedom, which her Re|pre&s;entatives &s;o ju&s;tly claim; and as every Man mu&s;t expect his Share in the Troubles of the Times, if he him&s;elf mu&s;t meet with any, may it be becau&s;e he holds a Regard to Con&s;cience, and public and private Ju&s;tice, e&s;&s;ential to the Character of a Patriot, and the Cau&s;e of <HI>America,</HI> too ju&s;t and &s;acred to
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
be promoted by any Action, "which Ju&s;tice or Chri&s;tianity mu&s;t condemn," and, in the Language of the Continental Congre&s;s, he mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;heth, <HI>that the Annals of</HI> America, or any of its Provinces, <HI>may never be &s;tained by the Recital of any &s;uch Actions.</HI>"</P>

<HEAD>The TRUE MERIT OF COMMON SENSE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Piece, entitled <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the Inhabitants of <HI>America,</HI> being lately re-printed at <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> and great Pains taken to &s;pread the Notion of Independency from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and to form an <HI>American</HI> Republick, it be|comes the Bu&s;ine&s;s of every Per&s;on mo&s;t &s;e|riou&s;ly to con&s;ider the Tendency of &s;uch a Propo&s;al; and all &s;uch as look upon it as ruinous and de&s;tructive, mu&s;t at lea&s;t be in|excu&s;able, in their own Brea&s;ts, if they do not endeavour to point out the many Mi&s;|takes and Oddities on which that Pamphlet is grounded.</P>
<P>The Novelty of the Thing, the Aver&s;ion a free-born People mu&s;t ever have to &s;ubmit to what they think Slavery, the Fears of be|ing brought to an abject Submi&s;&s;ion to op|pre&s;&s;ive Laws, the Dread of being deprived of Property, and perhaps of Life, with a Variety of other Con&s;iderations, may have
<PB N="2" REF="9">
given this Pamphlet, with many Per&s;ons, a Degree of Weight which does not appear due to its intrin&s;ic Merit; and perhaps it may, without Impropriety, be &s;aid, that their Extent of Reading has not led the Gene|rality of <HI>Americans</HI> to a very accurate and exten&s;ive Acquaintance with the Subject in Que&s;tion; however that be, it is &s;uppo&s;ed in a Matter of &s;uch infinite Moment, every confiderate Man would wi&s;h to be thoroughly informed of what may be &s;aid on both Sides of this Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>If my Conjectures of the Author do not deceive me, he is a Gentleman for whom I have a real E&s;teem; but "the Wi&s;e and Wor|thy need not the Triumph of a Pamphlet;" and therefore, without any Apology, I will venture to &s;ubmit &s;ome of his and my Remarks to the Judgment of every impartial Reader.</P>
<P>What Rea&s;ons may have induced the Au|thor to &s;end his Thoughts abroad, under the Title of <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> is needle&s;s to enquire; if he means that his Opinion is the Common Sen&s;e of all <HI>America,</HI> or that all tho&s;e who do not think with him are de&s;titute of Com|mon Sen&s;e, Time, without any Rea&s;oning, may convince him of his Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>I conceive his Notions about Society and Government are only introductory to his main View; I &s;hall take no further Notice of them, than, as they appear to me, to lay a very indifferent Foundation for a very indif|ferent Building.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10">Suppo&s;ing, as he a&s;&s;erts, <HI>there were "a Difference between Society and Government, and their Origins very different,"</HI> he will hardly be able to conceive Society &s;ub&s;i&s;ting with|out Government; and tho' Society be re|duced to its &s;malle&s;t Number, yet even two Per&s;ons, probably, could not live long hap|pily together, without agreeing upon &s;ome Rule of Conduct, which is, in other Words, &s;ubmitting to &s;ome Government. The Author begins with giving us a very di&s;couraging Idea of Government in any Shape. The fir&s;t Notion of Government which this Founder of <HI>American</HI> Independency proceeds upon is, that "it is produced by our Wickedne&s;s," and, in its be&s;t State, "is a nece&s;&s;ary Evil." I am greatly afraid the Government he pro|po&s;es mu&s;t be the Product of our Wicked|ne&s;s, but I cannot yet agree with him, "that it is a nece&s;&s;ary Evil."</P>
<P>To give us a clear Idea of the De&s;ign and End of Government, he &s;uppo&s;es "a &s;mall Number of Per&s;ons &s;ettled in &s;ome &s;eque&s;|tred Part of the Earth; he then forms them into Society, then repre&s;ents them as relax|ing in Duty and Attachment, (Page 4,) and then forming them&s;elves into Government, to &s;upply the Defect of Moral Virtue." I would a&s;k him, whence tho&s;e fir&s;t Set|tlers came? by what Means they reached the &s;eque&s;tred Country? and whether they mu&s;t not have agreed on Emigration, a Place of De&s;tiny, and a Method of pro|ceeding?
<PB N="4" REF="11">
that is to &s;ay, whether there was not &s;ome Society and Government una|voidably among them; and whether they mu&s;t not be con&s;idered in a State of Society and Government, prior to any Formation of it, in the Method a&s;&s;erted by this Author? It &s;eems more natural to conceive the Origin of Society and Government in the following Method: Of all Human Beings, one mu&s;t have been the fir&s;t, and prior, of Con&s;e|quence, to Society. The fir&s;t Human Being, we are accordingly informed by Revelation, was a Man, and God &s;aw it was not good for him to be alone, <HI>Gen.</HI> ii. 18. It is ex|pre&s;&s;ly &s;aid, that Woman was created with a View to bring Man into a State of Society, <HI>Gen.</HI> ii. 18. His Priority of Exi&s;tence, and the Manner of her Formation, and being brought unto Man, mu&s;t have rendered her in &s;ome Mea&s;ure dependent on <HI>Adam,</HI> even while they both continued in their original Perfection. By the expre&s;s Will of the Crea|tor, the Government was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Man, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 17. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 22. and being the Ruler of his Wife, he nece&s;&s;arily became al&s;o the Ruler of his Children; and from this very natural View of the Matter it would &s;eem, that Government and Society are nearly coeval, and that the very fir&s;t Mode of Go|vernment mu&s;t have re&s;embled Monarchy more than any other. From this it will by no Means follow, that the fir&s;t Man was the ab&s;olute Sovereign of all his Po&s;terity, or
<PB N="5" REF="12">
that Monarchy is the only Government of Divine In&s;titution; but as it is impo&s;&s;ible that Society and Government could have commenced any other Way, &s;o to &s;ubject all Men to one, or the Head of a Family, is contradictory in it&s;elf; for if Fatherhood gives an ab&s;olute Power over the Children, then it re&s;ts in all Parents, and, con&s;equently, had <HI>Seth</HI> commanded his Children to have re&s;i&s;ted <HI>Adam,</HI> they would, on this Scheme, have been obliged to do it, tho' by another Part of it, they were obliged to unlimited Obedience to <HI>Adam.</HI> I therefore perfectly a|gree with the Author, when he &s;aith, <HI>"What|ever Form of Government appears mo&s;t likely to en&s;ure us Security, with the lea&s;t Expence, and greate&s;t Benefit, is preferable to all others;"</HI> and all I plead for is, that in &s;ome In&s;tances Monarchy has done this, and may do this as much as any Form, whenever the Monarch makes the good of his Subjects his principal Study and Endeavour. It is a Fact, (tho' I am far from recommending an Imitation of the Example,) that &s;ince <HI>Denmark</HI> made their King ab&s;olute, they have, for a Century, been happier, and better governed, than they had been for a Century, or perhaps ever before. If I were to form a Judgment of the Author's Skill and Depth of Thought, as to the Nature of Government, from his Definition of it, I confe&s;s I &s;hould be under &s;ome Difficulty; he certainly mu&s;t have an undoubted Right to claim it, as being entirely original. "It is,
<PB N="6" REF="13">
(&s;aith he,) pray what? It is a Mode, a Mode rendered nece&s;&s;ary by the Inability of Moral Virtue, to govern the World." There may be Meaning in this, but all I can pick out is, that Government is not a Sub&s;tance, but a Mode. A very rare and &s;agacious Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>If his Maxim, "That the more &s;imple a thing is, the le&s;s it is liable to be di&s;ordered, and the ea&s;ier repaired," which is undoubt|edly a very true one, be applied, as it is by him, to Government, I &s;hould think it mu&s;t plead for Monarchy. The &s;imple&s;t Idea that can be formed of Government, is one to rule, and one or more to obey; the mo&s;t per|fect Government is where the mo&s;t perfect Being rules, and all his good Creatures im|plicitly and perfectly obey; and tho' no &s;uch Government can obtain among &s;inful Men, yet certainly Monarchy is much more &s;imple than Ari&s;tocracy or Democracy. This the Author could not help being aware of, and allows, but in perfect Contradiction to the Principle on which he &s;ets out, calls "ab&s;olute," <HI>i. e.</HI> the mo&s;t &s;imple Govern|ment, "a Di&s;grace to Human Nature;" then declares, almo&s;t in the &s;ame Breath, that "&s;uch Governments have an Advantage not to be found in any other Form, and lea&s;t of all in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution." If his "fir&s;t Idea of Government, is derived from a Principle in Nature, which no Art can overturn; that the Firmne&s;s of a Government lies in its Simplicity; and that all Govern|ments
<PB N="7" REF="14">
that are complex, of Cour&s;e are pre|carious," then every judicious Reader mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the whole Treati&s;e is a con&s;tant Contradiction to the Principle on which the Author builds the Whole of his Plan and A&s;&s;ertions. He &s;ets out with an A&s;&s;ertion, that Simplicity is e&s;&s;ential to Permanency, and then writes a Treati&s;e again&s;t that Sim|plicity, and propo&s;es a Plan of Government far more complex, and con&s;equently far more unnatural, than tho&s;e he pretends to aboli&s;h.</P>
<P>As the Author's great Aim is to overthrow the Con&s;titution, and to build &s;omething, at pre&s;ent unknown even to him&s;elf, on its Ruins, he accordingly next labours to cure us of the Prejudices which hitherto we entertained in its Favour; if he has &s;ucceeded, or does &s;ucceed in the Attempt, I mu&s;t a&s;cribe it to a Maxim he advances, and I can look upon as true only on this Suppo&s;ition, <HI>"Time makes more Converts than Rea&s;on."</HI> Let us hear him: <HI>"To &s;ay that the Con&s;titution of England is a Union of three Powers, checking each other, is farcical; either the Words have no Meaning, or they are a flat Contradiction."</HI> Now, that the three different Branches of the Legi&s;lature are, and always have been, a Check upon each other, Hi&s;tory clearly proves; of all Proofs, Facts afford the &s;tronge&s;t, and what exi&s;ts, implies neither Farce, Un|meaning, nor Contradiction. "The Preroga|tive, (&s;aith <HI>Rapin,</HI>) of the Sovereign, of the Nobles, and of the People, are corrected by
<PB N="8" REF="15">
each other, in &s;uch a Manner, that they are one another's mutual Support; and at the &s;ame Time either of tho&s;e three Powers can lay invincible Ob&s;tacles in the Way of what|ever Enterprizes one of the other two, or even both together could form, to make them&s;elves independent."</P>
<P>Where is the Ab&s;urdity of the Suppo&s;ition, <HI>"that a King,</HI> (or any Man, or Sett of Men,) <HI>ought not to be tru&s;ted without being looked after."</HI> It may be very rea&s;onable to put it in a Man's Power to do Good, and yet to re|&s;train him from doing Harm: This cannot hurt the be&s;t Man, and may be &s;ome Security again&s;t the wor&s;t; it may happen, <HI>"that the Commons may be wi&s;er and more worthy of Confidence than the Crown,"</HI> and it may al&s;o happen otherwi&s;e, and the only Remedy that can be propo&s;ed is preci&s;ely that which the Author turns into Ridicule, <HI>i. e.</HI> to make Crown and Commons mutual Checks upon each other. There is &s;omething exceedingly confu&s;ed in the Paragraph where the Author labours to &s;hew the Ridicule of Monarchy, and hard to determine what he means by the "different Parts of it, which unnaturally oppo&s;e and de&s;troy each other." The Folly of any Man, in any Condition, may "&s;hut him from the World, and the Means of In|formation;" his State need not. The pre|&s;ent Emperor, and King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> are pro|bably more minutely acquainted with the State of their Dominions than any one of
<PB N="9" REF="16">
their Subjects; I &s;hould think an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> King al&s;o might be at Liberty to read <HI>Com|mon Sen&s;e,</HI> or a News-Paper.</P>
<P>To his Que&s;tion, "How came the King by a Power which the People are afraid to tru&s;t, and always are obliged to check;" I an&s;wer, all Power that is not under the Guidance of infinite Wi&s;dom needs check|ing: But, becau&s;e it is un&s;afe to tru&s;t a Ruler with unlimited Power, is he to be without any Power at all? Or, becau&s;e there can be no Ruling where there is no Power, is it therefore nece&s;&s;ary or prudent to entru&s;t him with Power without Limits? We have two In&s;tances at lea&s;t where the Commons checked and &s;topt the Power of the Crown, and thus re&s;tored and pre&s;erved the Liberty of the Subject; and the Remark of <HI>Rapin</HI> is very judicious: "If the Parliament had been contented with re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the Govern|ment upon its ancient Foundation, it is very likely it had never afterwards been ea&s;ily &s;haken, but it is very hard to ob&s;erve a ju&s;t Medium upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions. This was the very thing which won the King Friends, which he had infallibly been without if the Ballance had been held with a &s;teady Hand." This Ob&s;ervation of a Foreigner may even now de&s;erve particular Attention.</P>
<P>If the Author is an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> it mu&s;t be owned he has pretty well got the better of the National Pride and Rea&s;on of an <HI>Engli&s;h|man;</HI> and &s;o little Merit has the Con&s;titu|tion
<PB N="10" REF="17">
in his Eyes, that he would have us be|lieve it as a plain Truth, "that it is wholly owing to the Con&s;titution of the People, and not to the Con&s;titution of the Government, that the Crown is not &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> as in <HI>Turkey.</HI>" As to the Con&s;titution of the People, it is certain that the <HI>Turks</HI> killed more of their Emperors, than ever the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> did of their <HI>Kings;</HI> and if the Author can think <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> De&s;poti&s;m preferable to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, it may &s;erve as a Hint of what may be expected of a Govern|ment formed upon his Principles.</P>
<P>The Propo&s;ition, that <HI>"Mankind are origi|nally Equals in the Order of Creation,"</HI> ex|tended as far as it may lead, is a very levelling Principle. There are &s;ome natural Di&s;tinc|tions which cannot fail having very great Effects; one Man is born &s;ooner than an|other, and all Men certainly not equal in Point of Sen&s;e and bodily Strength; &s;ome have greater Opportunities to advance them|&s;elves than others, and from &s;uch Circum|&s;tances, however accidental, &s;ome Superiority almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly takes Place; and though Kings and Subjects are not a Di&s;tinction of Nature, yet that &s;ome &s;hould rule, and others obey, is e&s;&s;ential to Society. No Society can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Government, and no Govern|ment without Rule and Obedience; and however Nature may put a Ridicule upon hereditary Succe&s;&s;ion, "by giving an A&s;s for a Lion," it mu&s;t be owned that &s;ome &s;eem
<PB N="11" REF="18">
by Nature formed to rule, and others to obey; &s;ome by a happy Mould to amend the Errors of old, and e&s;tabli&s;h new Forms of Government, like our Author; and others, implicitly to acquie&s;ce in any Government, whether under the Direction of a Monarch, or our Author.</P>
<P>Heaven and Hell have their Governments. &mdash;"Male and Female are Di&s;tinctions of Nature;" but I &s;uppo&s;e the Author would not give up the Government of the Male to the Female Part of the Creation; and if the Female will not give it up to the Male, which (Mankind being all equal in the Order of the Creation) they &s;urely need not, then there will be War, and this War mu&s;t con|tinue as long as both Parties are able to carry it on, and de&s;troy all Society, <HI>i. e.</HI> all Man|kind in the End, or el&s;e i&s;&s;ue in the Sub|mi&s;&s;ion of one to the other, or Indepen|dency, and Separation of both. To e&s;tabli&s;h a perfect Equality in Sentiment and Power, will be found too difficult among imperfect Beings.</P>
<P>As every Argument that has an Appear|ance of Scripture to &s;upport it, with many Per&s;ons, is deci&s;ive, the Author makes no &s;mall u&s;e of it again&s;t Kings and Kingly Go|vernment; it will be very ea&s;y to &s;hew that his Remarks prove nothing le&s;s than what is intended.</P>
<P><HI>"In the early Ages there were no Kings and con&s;equently no Wars."</HI> Let him remember,
<PB N="12" REF="19">
that War is mentioned before Kings; no Kings are mentioned before the Flood, but neverthele&s;s the Earth was full of Violence, <HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 15.</P>
<P>I do not know how <HI>Holland</HI> came in, in Support of this A&s;&s;ertion, but &s;o it is that he immediately adds, <HI>"Holland, without a King, has enjoyed more Peace for the la&s;t Century, than any of the Monarchical Governments in Europe."</HI> Either he mu&s;t never have read Hi&s;tory, or think no Body el&s;e ever did. This A&s;&s;ertion of his mu&s;t either e&s;tabli&s;h his gro&s;s Ignorance, or for ever &s;ink his Cha|racter, as a Writer of Candour, or Man of Veracity.</P>
<P>"The quiet and rural Life of the fir&s;t Patriarchs," was not &s;o entirely &s;o as the Author pretends; there was Murder before there were Kings, <HI>Abraham</HI> was concerned in War, and there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted Strife between him and <HI>Lot,</HI> &s;o that the Land could not bear them, <HI>Gen.</HI> xiii. 6, 7. "If Government by Kings was fir&s;t introduced by the Hea|thens," yet we read very early of one that was a King of Peace and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and compared to the Son of God; and if the Heathens paid divine Honours to their de|cea&s;ed Kings, probably it was becau&s;e they were good Kings and Benefactors; but it will never warrant the Author to &s;ay, that the <HI>"Chri&s;tians</HI> pay greater, and diviner Hon|ours to their King while yet living," than
<PB N="13" REF="20">
the Heathens did who wor&s;hipped them after their Death.</P>
<P>I call it a daring A&s;&s;ertion, when the Author &s;aith, (Page 11,) <HI>"The Will of the Almighty expre&s;&s;ly di&s;approves of Government by Kings."</HI> Tho' he &s;tiles the Pa&s;&s;age, <HI>Render therefore unto Cae&s;ar the Things which are Cae&s;ar's,</HI> "the Scripture Doctrine of Courts;" they are not the le&s;s the Words of him, all who&s;e Words are faithful and true; and tho&s;e who would judge properly of the Merit of his A&s;&s;ertion, need only be at the Trouble of reading a &s;ingle Pa&s;&s;age, viz. "Submit your|&s;elves to every Ordinance of Men, for the Lord's Sake, to the King as &s;upreme," 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 13; and when he ob&s;erves, that at the Time of our Saviour, "the <HI>Jews</HI> were without a "King," he errs, becau&s;e he attends not to the Scripture. The <HI>Jews,</HI> as a Nation, then avowed, <HI>We have no King but Cae&s;ar,</HI> John xix. 15; and he has not mended the Mat|ter, by adding, that "they were in a State of Va&s;&s;alage to the <HI>Romans," i. e.</HI> they had no King, but were Va&s;&s;als to the <HI>Roman</HI> Em|peror.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> under the Judges, is not the cleare&s;t Part of their Hi&s;tory; it is as full fraught with Wickedne&s;s and Con|fu&s;ion as the Annals of mo&s;t of their Kings; and it does not add much to the Honour of his favourite Propo&s;ition, that &s;ome of their wor&s;t Tran&s;actions are introduced with the Remark, "At that Time there was no King
<PB N="14" REF="21">
in <HI>I&s;rael," Judges</HI> xviii. 1, and xix. 1.; and that it is twice repeated in the &s;ame Book, "There was no King in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and every Man did what was Right in his own Eyes," <HI>Judges</HI> xviii. 6, and xxi. 25. When he &s;aith, <HI>"Mo|narchy</HI> (perhaps he meant the e&s;tabli&s;hing of it) <HI>is ranked in Scripture as one of the Sins of the Jews, for which a Cur&s;e in Re&s;erve is denounced again&s;t them,"</HI> I &s;hould have been glad to &s;ee the la&s;t Part &s;upported by &s;ome Quotation. Of the Tran&s;actions he alludes to, I &s;hall take &s;ome Notice:</P>
<P>In the Ca&s;e of <HI>Gideon,</HI> I would ob&s;erve, that "Rule thou over us," and "Be thou our King," are not equivalent Expre&s;&s;ions; there may be Rule without King&s;hip; and though the Author is bitter again&s;t Kings, I &s;uppo&s;e he will allow that, without any Impiety, &s;ome may rule and others obey their Rulers. Neither can the Author prove that <HI>Gideon</HI> declined this Honour, it being highly pro|bable that he did rule over them to his dying Day, even for the Space of Forty Years.</P>
<P>The Rejection of the Theocracy, which had hitherto obtained, and the De&s;ire of hav|ing a King over them, like the Heathen Nations, was undoubtedly a very great Wick|edne&s;s; but wicked and fooli&s;h as it was, many of the Author's Inferences from it can|not be &s;upported.</P>
<P>It is trifling to find Fault with the Term. One who&s;e Authority po&s;&s;ibly he would re|&s;pect, <HI>(Cromwell)</HI> ob&s;erved, the Harm lay not
<PB N="15" REF="22">
in the four Letters K, I, N, G. There have been very good Kings, and very wicked Judges; and the Author, one would think, choo&s;es to be mi&s;taken, when he &s;aith, "The Scripture takes no Notice of <HI>David</HI> officially as a King, but only as a Man after God's own Heart." The contrary is true; "God cho&s;e <HI>David,</HI> and took him from the Sheep-folds; he brought him to feed <HI>Jacob,</HI> his People; &s;o he fed them according to the Integrity of his Heart, and guided them by the Skillfulne&s;s of his Hands," <HI>P&s;alm</HI> lxxviii. 72, 73. He is taken Notice of as King, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> xxi. 1&mdash;9; and, what mu&s;t be particularly di&s;agreeable to the Author, he had the Pro|mi&s;e of an hereditary Kingdom. I have &s;worn unto <HI>David,</HI> "I will build up thy Throne to all Generations; it &s;hall be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for ever as the Moon, and as a faith|ful Witne&s;s in Heaven," <HI>P&s;alm</HI> lxxxix. 3, 4, 35.</P>
<P>The Author is not happier when he makes the Almighty enter his "Prote&s;t again&s;t Monarchical Government," and &s;aith, "this mu&s;t be true, or the Scripture is fal&s;e." Now that Kings and Monarchy are not ab&s;olutely &s;inful, and that God Almighty has not pro|te&s;ted again&s;t their Exi&s;tence, I &s;uppo&s;e will appear &s;ufficiently clear from the following Pa&s;&s;age: <HI>"Thou &s;halt in any wi&s;e &s;et him King over thee, whom the Lord thy God &s;hall choo&s;e;"</HI> and then, among other Rules pre&s;cribed, he cautions him, "that his Heart may not be
<PB N="16" REF="23">
lifted up above his Brethren, and that he turn not a&s;ide from the Commandment, to the Right Hand, or to the Left, <HI>to the end that he may prolong his Days in his Kingdom; he and his Children, in the Mid&s;t of I&s;rael," Deut.</HI> xvii. 15, 20.</P>
<P>What the Author alledges again&s;t Heredi|ditary Succe&s;&s;ion, may appear very plau&s;ible to &s;uch as only &s;uperficially con&s;ider the Mat|ter; but whatever Inconveniences it may cau&s;e or imply, the Danger in keeping Government altogether elective will u&s;ually be found to over-ballance any Advantage. What the Author calls "the &s;tronge&s;t natural Proof again&s;t it," does not amount to much; if Nature turns Hereditary Succe&s;&s;ion into Ri|dicule, "by frequently giving an A&s;s for a Lion," it will follow, that whenever Nature gives a wi&s;e Son unto a wi&s;e Father, &s;he ap|proves Hereditary Succe&s;&s;ion, and di&s;approves the Care of a Parent to provide for his Fa|mily, whenever &s;he deprives him of Children, or leaves him none but worthle&s;s De&s;cend|ants; but, exclu&s;ive of what Nature may do, or not do, upon this Occa&s;ion, I would a&s;k, Whether it never happens in Republicks that the Choice falls upon A&s;&s;es as well as upon Lions? There are A&s;&s;es among all Ranks of Men, Authors not excepted.</P>
<P>Le&s;t the Author &s;hould too much plume him&s;elf upon the Wit of his Compari&s;on be|tween original Sin and Hereditary Succe&s;&s;ion, I would ob&s;erve, that every Compact made
<PB N="17" REF="24">
between Parties and their Heirs mu&s;t be bind|ing on Po&s;terity, and there is neither Hard|&s;hip nor Ab&s;urdity in this; whether the Com|pact be a prudent and beneficial one is the only Que&s;tion. I dare &s;ay, the Author of <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> would now chearfully enter into any Treaty that would &s;ecure Liberty and Hap|pine&s;s to him&s;elf and all his De&s;cendants, upon the &s;imple Condition, that him&s;elf &s;hould remain an hone&s;t Man as long as he lived; he would not think him&s;elf ju&s;t to his Po&s;terity, if he neglected &s;o ea&s;y and honour|able an Opportunity to make them all free and happy; a&s;&s;uredly, all his Sneers notwith|&s;tanding, he would be willing that Po&s;terity &s;hould be as free and happy as him&s;elf, if to continue free and hone&s;t &s;hould be the only Condition.</P>
<P>In human Governments it is impo&s;&s;ible to guard again&s;t all Inconveniencies; that may be counted the be&s;t which has the fewe&s;t. Republican Governments are not without their Dangers; and if Men that think them|&s;elves born to reign are apt to grow in&s;olent, it is a Misfortune, from which tho&s;e who have neither Right nor Capacity to rule others, are not at all exempted; and frequently the People, <HI>i. e.</HI> a few People, have cho&s;en others over them, "the mo&s;t ignorant and unfit" of any that could po&s;&s;ibly be found within their Bounds. <HI>Poland</HI> is the la&s;t Kingdom that remained elective; but though it contains Twenty Millions of Inhabitants, it has long
<PB N="18" REF="25">
been the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant; and &s;o many Wars have attended their Elections, as, at la&s;t, al|mo&s;t annihilated the Kingdom.</P>
<P>After the Civil War, the Crown was, per|haps, more arbitrary than before; for the People, weary to &s;ubmit to many Tyrants, rather cho&s;e to &s;ubmit to one. The Benefit of that Convul&s;ion was lo&s;t, becau&s;e the Con&s;titution was thrown off of its Ba&s;is; at the Revolution, the Con&s;titution and Succe&s;&s;ion was pre&s;erved, and the Liberty of the Nation e&s;tabli&s;hed more than ever.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething remarkable in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Holland.</HI> They, more than once, declared again&s;t Hereditary Succe&s;&s;ion. To prevent this, after the Demi&s;e of <HI>William</HI> I. to whom they were under &s;uch great Obli|gations, they declared them&s;elves Sovereign States, but were &s;oon brought &s;o low, as to offer them&s;elves to <HI>France,</HI> and to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and would have been willing to &s;ubmit to any Ma&s;ter but their old one; and after receiving the Duke of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> to ad|mini&s;ter the Supreme Power, they were &s;till more glad to part with him again, and to make Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> (then very young,) their General, who was the proper Heir, who&s;e Father had laid the Foundation of their Republick, and who gained them the Power and Title of a Free State. In 1672 and 1747, the next Heir, King <HI>William,</HI> and the late Stadtholder, again became their Saviours, and they found the Nece&s;&s;ity and
<PB N="19" REF="26">
Advantage of aboli&s;hing the perpetual Edict again&s;t a Stadtholder, and to make the Office hereditary in the Males and Females of the <HI>Na&s;&s;au</HI> Family.</P>
<P>In following the Author's Thoughts on the pre&s;ent State of <HI>American</HI> Affairs, I have no Objection to the Preliminary Conditions by him propo&s;ed; let him hear me, and let our Readers hear us both, and coolly judge for them&s;elves. I al&s;o agree with him, as to the Worth and Importance of the Cau&s;e; but if he takes a nearer View, he will find that the pre&s;ent <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire in <HI>America,</HI> &s;o far from being "an Eighth Part of the habitable Globe," is, perhaps, not an Eighth Part of <HI>North America;</HI> but this is immaterial to the Merit of the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>To clear his Way, the Author takes No|tice of &s;ome Objections to his Plan, and his An&s;wers to them mu&s;t now be con&s;idered: He does not deny "that <HI>America has flou|ri&s;hed under her Connection with</HI> Great Bri|tain," but roundly an&s;wers, <HI>America</HI> would have flouri&s;hed as much, and probably much more, had no <HI>European</HI> Power taken any Notice of her. In Reply it may be &s;aid, that <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> in that Connection, has flouri&s;hed, is a certain Fact; what the Author advances, at be&s;t is mere Suppo&s;ition and Uncertainty, and there is Rea&s;on to believe <HI>America</HI> owes her Progre&s;s to her Connection, becau&s;e the Colonies of no other Nation are equally flou|ri&s;hing, and the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colonies
<PB N="20" REF="27">
now wear a very different A&s;pect &s;ince they be|came <HI>Briti&s;h.</HI> Be&s;ides, if <HI>Great Britain</HI> had taken no Notice of <HI>America,</HI> perhaps <HI>France</HI> might. It is far from being certain, and it is indeed notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e, that <HI>America,</HI> unconnected with <HI>Great Britain,</HI> might not have been a tempting Object to <HI>France;</HI> and however this may be, certain it is, and by <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> acknowledged, that <HI>America</HI> flouri&s;hed in her Connection with <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and while the Connection is advantageous, it can hardly be worth while to run the Ri&s;k of an Expe|riment to the contrary, only that we may a&s;certain the Que&s;tion, whether we might not as well have done without <HI>Great Britain. Common Sen&s;e</HI> al&s;o allows, "that <HI>Britain</HI> has protected us;" but &s;aith, "&s;he would have defended <HI>Turkey</HI> from the &s;ame Motive." Be it &s;o, &s;till I cannot find that it did <HI>America</HI> any Harm to be protected; and think it mo&s;t wretched Policy to &s;uppo&s;e, that, &s;eparated from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> we &s;hould always be at Peace with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> for (be&s;ides that I would rather be at War with both, than with <HI>Great Britain,</HI>) there is no State but what may be involved in War on its own Account; and it would certainly be very con|&s;i&s;tent with the Views and Policy of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> to make Conque&s;ts, which at once would weaken <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and that they may &s;till have a De&s;ire for <HI>Ca|nada</HI> and <HI>Florida,</HI> though they both had de|clared
<PB N="21" REF="28">
them&s;elves independent of <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI> need not in the lea&s;t be doubted.</P>
<P>If <HI>"Europe,</HI> though not <HI>England, is the Parent Country of</HI> America," this contradicts what the Author a&s;&s;erts, (Page 45.) "It is evident they belong to different Sy&s;tems, <HI>Eng|land</HI> to <HI>Europe, America</HI> to it&s;elf;" and though he reprobates the Term, Mother Country, becau&s;e <HI>America</HI> has not been peopled from <HI>England</HI> alone, yet all that came into <HI>America,</HI> where&s;oever they came from, came into it as into an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government, and Thou&s;ands of Foreigners, for the Sake of being natura|lized, and enjoying the Benefits of a Con&s;ti|tution, on which they &s;et greater Value than this Author. Though not one Third of the Inhabitants of a Province &s;hould be of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> De&s;cent, yet the Author may be per&s;uaded, their Proportion is &s;till &s;maller who have no Feelings for <HI>Great Britain;</HI> who, like him, have renounced their Oath of Allegiance, think Ab&s;olute Governments preferable to Limited Monarchy, or any one Plan his Wi&s;|dom could contrive, or his forward Zeal ob|trude, &s;uperior to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>He very ju&s;tly a&s;ks, (Page 37,) <HI>"What have we to do with &s;etting all the World at De|fiance?"</HI> But whom has this Author &s;pared? I &s;hould think it good Policy to le&s;&s;en the Number of our Enemies, and increa&s;e that of our Friends; the Author does directly the contrary; he is angry with all "that think well of the <HI>European</HI> World." He has wrote
<PB N="22" REF="29">
again&s;t every King and Prince in the Univer&s;e; he calls his (or at lea&s;t my) Natural Prince, "a <HI>Pharaoh,"</HI> and "a Royal Brute;" he treats the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation as our profe&s;&s;ed Enemy; he abu&s;es the City of <HI>London,</HI> though it has heartily e&s;pou&s;ed the <HI>American</HI> Cau&s;e; he abu&s;eth the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> A&s;&s;embly; he inveighs again&s;t every Man of Moderation; he avows Principles of Revenge, which would rather &s;uit the Character of a Devil than a <HI>Chri&s;tian;</HI> he labours, to his utmo&s;t, to render our Quarrels perpetual, and little better than bids Defiance to all Mankind, when he &s;aith, "our pre&s;ent Numbers are &s;ufficient to repel the Force of all the World," (Page 61.) Al|ready none but his few Friends have e&s;caped his La&s;h, and his <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> is very &s;uffi|cient to warn us of what may be expected, when he and they once become the Ruling Powers. His Challenge, "to &s;hew a &s;ingle Advantage this Continent can reap from be|ing connected with <HI>Great Britain,"</HI> is fully an&s;wered in &s;ome Di&s;&s;ertations publi&s;hed &s;ome Years ago at <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> and the Advan|tages of a perpetual Union are capable of being proved to a Demon&s;tration. In this Connection we have flouri&s;hed, this Connec|tion is capable of being made reciprocally more advantageous, and I challenge him, in my Turn, to &s;hew, that in any other Situation we can be equally &s;afe, free, and happy.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t either &s;tand alone, or be con|nected with &s;ome other Power. All wi&s;e
<PB N="23" REF="30">
States &s;ecure unto them&s;elves Friends and Allies, and the Author him&s;elf gives &s;ufficient Hints, that he does not wi&s;h we &s;hould &s;tand alone. If we are to have any Connections with other States, political or commercial, the Que&s;tion will be, with what States it will be mo&s;t to our Advantage to be in Connection? The Author does not rightly &s;peak it out, but he has an undoubted Eye to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> I abhor and de&s;pi&s;e the Thought. <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> are the Enemies of our Re|ligion; they will, I hope, never be able to render us the Services that <HI>Great Britain</HI> hath already; and none but a Madman would look for Protection again&s;t <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to tho&s;e who &s;o lately lay at <HI>Britain</HI>'s Mercy, and have &s;o evidently been unable to protect them&s;elves.</P>
<P>His Argument in favour of Separation from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which he draws from the Time when <HI>America</HI> was di&s;covered, is very fanciful. At the Time of the Reformation, &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Prote&s;tants did, indeed, endea|vour to find an A&s;ylum in <HI>America,</HI> but they were all cut off by the Cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Every Prote&s;tant Settlement was made by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and if Popi&s;h and Prie&s;t|ly Bigottry per&s;ecuted at Home, it mu&s;t be owned the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government has opened a Door to the Per&s;ecuted, and &s;uffered them to live unmole&s;ted in <HI>America;</HI> however, if the Author will derive any Weight in the pre&s;ent Quarrel, from the Time and De&s;ign of Pro|vidence
<PB N="24" REF="31">
in the Di&s;covery of <HI>America,</HI> he may plea&s;e him&s;elf whenever a Reconciliation &s;hould make this Continent, as he &s;aith, "not worth living in." Providence, by the late &s;ea&s;onable Di&s;covery of <HI>Otaheite,</HI> and the I&s;lands in the North We&s;t, graciou&s;ly meant to open a Sanctuary for him and his Friends.</P>
<P>That "the Authority of <HI>Great Britain</HI> over this Continent &s;ooner or later mu&s;t have an End," is a&s;&s;erted without any Proof, and in Oppo&s;ition to the Continental Congre&s;s; that Authority, properly exerci&s;ed, may con|tinue, with mutual Advantage, to the End of Time. In an&s;wer to his Caricatura of tho&s;e who do not wi&s;h for Separation, it may, at lea&s;t, with equal Ju&s;tice be &s;aid, all that are for Separation, are either intere&s;ted Men, who expect to be Gainers by the Change, or at lea&s;t to continue important during the Confu&s;ion; weak Men, who having never read much, and, taking up Matters upon the bare A&s;&s;ertions of others, cannot &s;ee; prejudiced Men, who will not &s;ee; and a certain Sett of hot Men, who think well of nobody but them&s;elves, and tho&s;e who join with them in Opinion, and tho&s;e u&s;ually al&s;o are weak Men who cannot &s;ee far off; prejudiced Men, wedded to their own Opinions; and intere&s;ted Men, who may al&s;o be afraid of being called to an Account for Actions too barefaced to be ju&s;tified upon any View or Principle, politi|cal or moral, and who pu&s;h Matters, not from any De&s;ire to &s;erve the Cau&s;e, but becau&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="32">
they think there is no other Chance of Safety to them&s;elves. Men deeply in Debt, and of de&s;perate Fortunes and Principles, are always the mo&s;t likely to rai&s;e and keep up publick Confu&s;ions.</P>
<P>No Man can feel more for the unhappy innocent Sufferers at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and I wi&s;h for a Reconciliation, that the Authors and Ad|vi&s;ers of &s;o much Cruelty may be brought to an&s;wer for their Conduct to the Ju&s;tice of a great and generous Nation. The Author, it &s;eems, is of the Number of tho&s;e who are di&s;tant from the Scene, but his lively Ima|gination and Re&s;entment are happy enough to make him feel and paint all its Horrors.</P>
<P>I &s;hall follow the Author's Arguments a|gain&s;t Reconciliation, not as they would ap|pear &s;ummed up in a natural Order, but as, out of the Fullne&s;s of his Heart, he has cho&s;en to interweave them with every Page of <HI>Common Sen&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>His main and leading Argument &s;eems to be, That <HI>it is impo&s;&s;ible to forget or forgive the Injuries</HI> America <HI>has received;</HI> and that <HI>who|ever had a Hou&s;e burnt, or a Relation killed, if he can make up the Matter after that, "hath the Heart of a Coward, and the Spirit of a Sycophant."</HI> I an&s;wer, had there been no Quarrel, there would have been no Need of a Reconciliation; more Hu&s;bands and Fa|thers have been killed in the Mini&s;terial Army than of the <HI>Americans;</HI> and if that could give the Author Satisfaction, the Lo&s;s of the
<PB N="26" REF="33">
<HI>Americans</HI> hath not gone unavenged. But how inhuman and horrid is the Principle on which he proceeds: Upon his Suppo&s;ition, two Na|tions once at War mu&s;t never again make Peace; but if Humanity cannot &s;et Bounds to the Rage of Man, Providence will; and none are more likely to have everla&s;ting Wars, than tho&s;e who renounce Peace and Reconciliation for ever. In our little Wars in <HI>America</HI> with the Natives, few Provinces but what have felt Horrors in Reality, which, in the Account of the Author, are &s;till ex|aggerated, and yet we were glad to make Peace. In the late War, the Mini&s;ter of the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> &s;et out with a Re&s;olution to leave nothing but Water and Ground in the Territories of <HI>Brandenburgh;</HI> the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> in his Turn, did all po&s;&s;ible Mi&s;chief to his Re&s;idence and Territories, but after all, both were glad to make Peace. <HI>Nature has</HI> not <HI>de&s;erted our Connection,</HI> and the Ocean that always lay between us, will not become impa&s;&s;able by a ju&s;t Reconciliation. Why &s;hould it be thought impo&s;&s;ible, that <HI>Great Britain</HI> may be as ju&s;t and mild as &s;he has been, and <HI>America</HI> become as free and happy as &s;he ought in that Connection. The Na|tion will not be mi&s;guided always; the &s;ame Mini&s;try may not continue always, and tho&s;e that would pu&s;h Matters to the utmo&s;t Ex|tremity, whoever they be, and wherever they may live, none will live for ever. It is not generous to &s;ay, "that <HI>Britain</HI> has not ma|nife&s;ted
<PB N="27" REF="34">
the lea&s;t Inclination towards a Com|promi&s;e;" the Cau&s;e of <HI>America</HI> has been pleaded by &s;ome of the fir&s;t Men in the Na|tion, and with an Ability and Strength, which, &s;ooner or later, mu&s;t an&s;wer the End.</P>
<P><HI>If "the Object contended for, ought always to bear &s;ome ju&s;t Proportion to the Expence;"</HI> it will al&s;o follow, that it is prudent to count the Co&s;t, before we contend for any Object. Whether a thing is ju&s;t and prudent, whe|ther an Object is attainable, whether the Means of attaining it are at hand, are always very proper Con&s;iderations; and nothing will prove a Remedy that is wor&s;e than the Di&s;ea&s;e. The Author next pretends to offer &s;ome Argu|ments, why Reconciliation would be the Ruin of this Continent. They ought to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t, he derives from the Negative of the Crown, and the unfriendly Temper of the King. Allowing the latter Part of this Argument the utmo&s;t Weight, it would be merely per&s;onal and temporary; I am afraid, however, if there is Weight in it at all, it ari&s;es from Re&s;entment, to what will be thought undutiful and indecent Treat|ment. Kings no more than private Men are in&s;en&s;ible to per&s;onal Injuries. Monarchs, as well as Subjects, may be mi&s;informed or mi&s;|taken; but to call the King "the greate&s;t Enemy this Continent hath, or can have," in my Opinion, can only &s;erve to prejudice Subjects again&s;t the King, and lead the King to think, that he is looked upon as an Enemy
<PB N="28" REF="35">
by his Subjects. While the Con&s;titution &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, the King's Negative mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t al&s;o; and this Power of the King has not ruined <HI>England,</HI> nor is it the Cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent Di&s;turbances in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P><HI>"After Matters are made up, can there be any Doubt the whole Power of the Crown will be exerted to keep America as low and humble as po&s;&s;ible;"</HI> more probably not. <HI>France</HI> is very indulgent to <HI>Al&s;ace</HI> and her <HI>American</HI> Colonies, to make them in Love with <HI>French</HI> Government. If we could have no Confidence in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ju&s;tice and Genero&s;ity, which would be very ungene|rous, &s;till we might expect the Mini&s;ter, by this Time, knows better than ea&s;ily again to quarrel with <HI>America.</HI> The King can do no Wrong; let us be reconciled, and formally &s;ue for Ju&s;tice again&s;t tho&s;e, by whom we &s;hall appear to have been injured.</P>
<P>The Author calls &s;ome things ridiculous, that either have no Exi&s;tence, or do not de|&s;erve to be &s;o called. No Youth of Twenty-one ever &s;aid in <HI>England, "to Six Millions of People, older and wi&s;er than him&s;elf, I forbid this Act of yours to be Law."</HI> There has been no Minority &s;ince <HI>Edward</HI> VI. who was a wi&s;e and good Prince, and far more worthy to reign, than many before and &s;ince. <HI>Holland</HI> was more than once indebted for her Safety and Pre&s;ervation to Princes of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Orange,</HI> who were but Youths; and when Democratical Rulers had brought
<PB N="29" REF="36">
her on the Brink of Ruin, <HI>Count Maurice</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> and the late King <HI>William,</HI> were but Twenty-one when they had the Supreme Command, retrieved their Affairs, and &s;aved the Nation.</P>
<P>His &s;econd Argument, in my Opinion, has le&s;s Weight; <HI>"the be&s;t Terms we can obtain, can amount to no more than a Temporary Ex|pedient."</HI> Why &s;o? If once we are &s;ettled again upon good Terms, &s;uch as claimed by the Continental Congre&s;s, why &s;hould we not remain united on &s;uch Terms for ever? The Fear <HI>that many of the American Inhabi|tants would &s;ell their Effects, and quit the Continent,</HI> on his own Principles is perfectly idle. Whither would they go? <HI>"Every Spot of the Old World being over-run with Oppre&s;|&s;ion."</HI> However, if any &s;hould not like to live in <HI>America,</HI> they might tran&s;port them|&s;elves to &s;ome &s;eque&s;tred Part of the Earth, and try the Experiment of forming a more perfect Government, upon the Plan of the Author.</P>
<P>But <HI>"the mo&s;t powerful of all Arguments is, that nothing but Independence can keep the Peace of the Continent, and pre&s;erve it in|violate from Civil Wars."</HI> As this is Specu|lation rather than Argument, what if the contrary &s;hould prove the Ca&s;e; and upon the very Propo&s;al of it, &s;omewhere or other, <HI>"a Revolt &s;hould happen more fatal than all the Malice of Great Britain."</HI> Should this ever prove the Ca&s;e, the Man will have
<PB N="30" REF="37">
much to an&s;wer for, who&s;e Rancour and Ra&s;hne&s;s has hurried on &s;o great a Calamity. <HI>"It is but &s;eldom that our fir&s;t Thoughts are truly correct;"</HI> and I imagine the whole Pamphlet contains chiefly fir&s;t Thoughts of the Author.</P>
<P>"The Colonies have manife&s;ted a Spirit of good Order and Obedience to the Conti|nental Congre&s;s," while they laboured at a Reconciliation. Whether the Temper of the People at large, will be the &s;ame, if their Aim and Conduct &s;hould be directly the re|ver&s;e, is a Que&s;tion of great Moment. The Fears, "that one Colony will &s;trive for Superiority over another," will not appear &s;o very childi&s;h, when the Conduct of &s;ome leading Men is duly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>When the Author &s;aith, <HI>"The Republicks of Europe are all (and we may &s;ay always) in Peace; Holland and Swi&s;&s;erland are with|out War, Foreign or Dome&s;tic;"</HI> he declares War again&s;t Truth, and mu&s;t have a very low Opinion of the <HI>Americans,</HI> if he could think to mi&s;lead them by &s;uch palpable Fal&s;hoods. The Republicks of <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Genoa</HI> have been involved in great Wars; and though Republicks have little or no Liberty, <HI>Holland</HI> has been involved in mo&s;t Wars in this Century, and lo&s;t all their Bar|rier Towns, and <HI>Bergen-op-Zoom,</HI> in one of the la&s;t. The Hi&s;tory of <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland</HI> al&s;o would furni&s;h him In&s;tances of War, &s;uffici|ent to prove, that the mo&s;t determined and
<PB N="31" REF="38">
prudent People may &s;uffer by a few Fire|brands; and whatever Advantages there may be in Republican Governments, all Political Writers will allow, that Monarchical can more ea&s;ily enter into Negotiations, and carry them on with greater Speed, Secrecy, and Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>I have nothing to &s;ay about his Plan to form a Continental Government; I wi&s;h it may never take Place, and therefore will not point out the Weakne&s;s of a Scheme, which, undoubtedly, will defeat it&s;elf, if ever it &s;hould be tried to be carried into Execution.</P>
<P>To ha&s;ten the Execution of his Plan, the Author urges, that otherwi&s;e &s;ome <HI>Ma&s;&s;anello</HI> may gather together the De&s;perate, and in|forms us, that this <HI>Thomas Ancillo</HI> prompted the People of <HI>Naples</HI> to revolt, and, in the Space of a Day became King. <HI>Ma&s;&s;anello</HI> never was King, but a popular Leader, and his true Hi&s;tory is not unin&s;tructive; he headed a Mob, rai&s;ed on Account of a Duty laid on Fruit, and, driven to De&s;pair by a bruti&s;h An&s;wer of the Vice-Re, bidding them to &s;ell their Wives and Children in Payment, at fir&s;t, while he was moderate, he became very formidable, and a &s;olemn Treaty was entered into by him and the Vice-Re, and publickly &s;worn to in the Church; next he became intoxicated with Power, or even delirious, and raved again&s;t his own Followers; he was then &s;hot, in or about a Church, and immediately as much
<PB N="32" REF="39">
execrated by the Mob as before he had been followed and applauded.</P>
<P>I &s;hould hardly take Notice of his Decla|rations again&s;t Reconciliation and Peace, were it not to point out &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions which ought to characterize the Author. To &s;ay, <HI>"That the Almighty has implanted in us in|extingui&s;hable Feelings" to keep up Re&s;ent|ment and Hatred;</HI> and that they are <HI>"the Guar|dians of his Image in our Heart,"</HI> is really flying in the Face of God Almighty. It &s;urely mu&s;t &s;hock every con&s;iderate Per&s;on, to &s;ee that a&s;cribed to God Almighty, which is a Di&s;grace to Man; and if it is not appli|cable to the A&s;&s;ertion, that Pa&s;&s;ion and Ha|tred are the Guardians of the Divine Image, I am unacquainted with any Propo&s;ition that de&s;erves to be called a Doctrine of Devils; Ju&s;tice will always be the more perfect and impartial if uninfluenced by Affections, and the Touches of Affections, whether Love or Hatred, above any thing have a Tendency to warp Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>There are many things which I pa&s;s over, not becau&s;e I think them true, or unan&s;wer|able, but becau&s;e it may be un&s;ea&s;onable to &s;hew their Ab&s;urdity; it is impo&s;&s;ible, how|ever, that the following &s;hould e&s;cape any con&s;iderate Reader's Notice.</P>
<P><HI>"Our pre&s;ent Numbers are &s;ufficient to re|pel the Force of the whole World."</HI> Doubtful as this may appear to many, I am perfectly convinced of the Truth of it, if ever it &s;hould
<PB N="33" REF="40">
happen that all the World &s;hould at once bring all their Force again&s;t us, which we may be well per&s;uaded will never happen. There is no Potentate now upon Earth that would &s;eriou&s;ly affirm his Numbers are &s;uffi|cient to repel the Forces of all the World. To his Maxim, <HI>"No Nation ought to be with|out a Debt,"</HI> I add, nor a Fund to pay it. I apprehend National Debts can be of very little Service, without a proportionable Na|tional Credit.</P>
<P>If any Man has a Mind to believe that <HI>"the Navy of</HI> England, <HI>at this Time, is not worth above Three Millions and a Half Ster|ling,"</HI> for me he may; and &s;o al&s;o if hence he &s;hould conclude the Author of <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> pays very little Regard to his Readers, in palming A&s;&s;ertions upon them which they may well doubt whether he can believe him&s;elf.</P>
<P>If <HI>"a Twelvemonth ago any common Pirate might have laid the City of</HI> Philadelphia <HI>under in&s;tant Contribution, nay, any daring Fellow, in a Brig of fourteen or &s;ixteen Guns, might have robbed the whole Continent,"</HI> it &s;eems &s;urprizing that it was never attempted. Per|haps others have a greater Dread of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Navy than our Author; perhaps to this Dread we were indebted for our Safety. Is it more &s;urprizing that we were &s;o very weak a Year ago, as to be at the Mercy of a &s;ingle Brig, or that we are &s;ince grown &s;o &s;trong, as to be able to cope with, and expect to get the better of, the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Navy?</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="41"><HI>"If</HI> America <HI>had a Twentieth Part of the Naval Force of</HI> Britain, <HI>&s;he would be by far an Over-match for her."</HI> Suppo&s;ing the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Navy to con&s;i&s;t of Two Hundred Ve&s;&s;els, the Twentieth Part would be Ten Ve&s;&s;els; a great Di&s;proportion, truly! But, according to <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> the Exi&s;tence of even the&s;e Ten Ve&s;&s;els is &s;till liable to an IF; but if we had them, who can doubt, that, as the Whole is equal to all its Parts, &s;o a Twentieth Part mu&s;t al&s;o be equal to the Whole.</P>
<P>To unite the Sinews of Commerce and De|fence is certainly &s;ound Policy; but whether &s;topping all Trade and Intelligence will bring about, or keep up this Union, Time mu&s;t &s;hew.</P>
<P>That with "the Increa&s;e of Commerce <HI>England</HI> lo&s;t its Spirit," I &s;uppo&s;e the Au|thor does not mean to prove, from the Hi&s;|tory of the la&s;t War, and from the Ri&s;ks <HI>Great Britain</HI> runs at pre&s;ent in the Quarrel with her Colonies; it will not follow that the more Men have to lo&s;e, the le&s;s they are will|ing to venture.</P>
<P>I come now to the many &s;trong and &s;triking Rea&s;ons, as the Author is plea&s;ed to call them, that <HI>"nothing can &s;ettle our Affairs more expediou&s;ly than an open and determined De|claration for Independence;"</HI> he mentions four; how &s;trong and &s;triking three of them may appear mu&s;t be left with every Reader, but what he calls the fourth is no Rea&s;on at all.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t he grounds on the Cu&s;tom of Nations, when any two are at War, for &s;ome
<PB N="35" REF="42">
other Power, not engaged in the Quarrel, to &s;tep in as Mediator, and bring about the Pre|liminaries of a Peace. This &s;ometimes is the Ca&s;e, but then it is between two con|tending Nations, that are both acknowledged independent by other States, and more e&s;pe|cially by the State that offers a Mediation. Upon his own Principle we mu&s;t be acknow|ledged independent by others, before any Na|tion can directly interfere; and I apprehend our Author does not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h between two very different Things, <HI>viz.</HI> our declaring our&s;elves independent, and our be|ing acknowledged and treated &s;o by others. However, the Author &s;eems to have &s;ome Thought of "Preliminaries of Peace," very incon&s;i&s;tent with the Feelings that he &s;aith, (Page 60,) di&s;tingui&s;h us from the Herd of common Animals; but perhaps Peace will not be &s;o di&s;gracing when introduced among us by foreign Nations.</P>
<P>The Author's &s;econd Rea&s;on de&s;erves very great Attention; it runs thus: <HI>"It is unrea|&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that</HI> France <HI>or</HI> Spain <HI>will give us any Kind of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, if we mean only to make u&s;e of that A&s;&s;i&s;tance for repairing the Breach, and &s;trengthening the Connection be|tween</HI> Britain <HI>and</HI> America, <HI>becau&s;e the&s;e Powers would be &s;ufferers by the Con&s;equence."</HI> I apprehend here is much more meant than expre&s;&s;ed. I &s;hall only make &s;ome very ge|neral Remarks:
<LIST>
<PB N="36" REF="43">
<ITEM>1&s;t, A&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> a|gain&s;t <HI>Great Britain</HI> is here expre&s;&s;ly avowed; this Avowal of A&s;&s;i&s;tance from our natural, hereditary, Popi&s;h Enemies, will be con&s;idered in a very &s;erious Light by Thou&s;ands of thinking Per&s;ons, in <HI>Britain, America,</HI> and every Prote&s;tant Country.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2dly, To obtain this A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the Author would renounce our Connection with <HI>Britain, i. e.</HI> with Prote&s;tants, our Parent State, and, at lea&s;t, Numbers among them, who have been and are our Friends.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3dly, In his Opinion it is certain we can|not obtain any A&s;&s;i&s;tance from them, unle&s;s we declare our&s;elves independent, and he would have us apply to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> on purpo&s;e to be able to effect a Separation from <HI>Great Britain</HI> for ever.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>A Variety of political, moral, and con&s;ci|entious Con&s;iderations here crowd in upon me, which I mu&s;t &s;uppre&s;s; but on the Sup|po&s;ition that his Propo&s;al to &s;ome may &s;eem ju&s;t and prudent, I would &s;till hint a few Doubts as to its an&s;wering the End. I would a&s;k,</P>
<P>Is the Author &s;ure, that, if we declare our|&s;elves independent of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> we &s;hall obtain A&s;&s;i&s;tance for a&s;king for it, from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and what is it to be? Is this A&s;|&s;i&s;tance to con&s;i&s;t of <HI>Men?</HI> That would be needle&s;s, as we have a Force of our own "capable to repel all the World;" or of <HI>Money?</HI> But that again we do not want, &s;ee|ing
<PB N="37" REF="44">
we can make as much as we plea&s;e; or in <HI>Ships?</HI> But this al&s;o we &s;hall have no Oc|ca&s;ion for, as ten Ships, (which we certainly can fit out, if any at all) in our Author's Opinion, are an Over-match for all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Navy. But be all this as it may, can <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain</HI> publickly avow our Cau&s;e, without unavoidably entering into War with <HI>Great Britain?</HI> Suppo&s;ing it in their Power, will they run the Ri&s;k of it, only to rai&s;e unto them|&s;elves a mo&s;t formidable Rival in independent Colonies? Will they become our Protectors upon cheaper Terms than <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and can they afford it?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing we obtain A&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> will not their fir&s;t and mo&s;t natural Reque&s;t be, (as it was Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and by them complied with,) to be put in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of our Sea Ports. Auxiliaries have frequently become Ma&s;ters; a &s;mall Number of Troops and Ships could not effect for us any great Matters, and a large one might bring about greater Matters than we might wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Whether the &s;hrewde&s;t Politicians dwell in <HI>France, Spain, Britain,</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> I will not take upon me to &s;ay; but I &s;hould think the Suppo&s;ition very natural, that <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain</HI> might afford the Colonies all the &s;ecret A&s;&s;i&s;tance they could, without entering into a War, probably with a View to keep up the Ball, weaken both Parties, and, in the End, to reap &s;ome Benefit from the Folly of the Par|ties engaged in this unnatural Quarrel. Large

Promi&s;es, undoubtedly, would never be want|ing. But it will &s;urprize many, no doubt, that <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> would break off the Connec|tion with <HI>Great Britain,</HI> becau&s;e to her "<HI>A|merica</HI> is only a &s;econdary Object, and &s;he hath never done us any good but for her own Sake," and propo&s;es a Connection with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> in Expectation they would make our Happine&s;s not their &s;econdary but primary Con&s;ideration, and a&s;&s;i&s;t us, not in the ungenerous Manner <HI>Great Britain</HI> has done, for their own Sake, but from the nobler De&s;ign of protecting the Liberty and Inde|pendence of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>If his third Rea&s;on hath any Truth or Weight, <HI>"we mu&s;t,</HI> at pre&s;ent, <HI>in the Eye of Foreign Nations, be con&s;idered as Rebels;"</HI> and, adds he, <HI>"the Precedent is &s;omewhat danger|ous to their Peace, for Men to be in Arms under the Name of Subjects."</HI> I an&s;wer, Foreign Nations and Writers, even in this Ca&s;e, make a great Di&s;tinction between a People that profe&s;s Subjection, while they only &s;truggle for Redre&s;s of what they think Grievances, and tho&s;e who altogether renounce Allegiance and Dependence. Foreign Nations formerly called the <HI>Hungarian</HI> In&s;urgents, and lately the <HI>Cor&s;icans,</HI> Malcontents; but all Nations (except <HI>France</HI>) called the <HI>Scotch,</HI> in 1745, Rebels. In the Author's Mode of Rea&s;oning, however, as we are now in Arms, and <HI>"com|mon Under&s;tanding cannot &s;o ea&s;ily &s;olve the Paradox as we that are on the Spot,"</HI> in the
<PB N="39" REF="46">
Eyes of other Nations we mu&s;t be looked upon as Rebels; well, and what follows? "The Precedent is &s;omewhat dangerous to them&s;elves;" then, I &s;uppo&s;e, we are not to expect any Trade from or with them, while they look upon us in this Light, nor look to them for A&s;&s;i&s;tance. This the Author &s;eems tacitly to look upon as the Ca&s;e, and an In|convenience; and how is it to be remedied? Why, that they may not look upon us as Rebels while we &s;till profe&s;s Allegiance, and promi&s;e all we can promi&s;e, to get Redre&s;s, we are next to di&s;own all Dependence and Allegiance, and then, of Cour&s;e, the Powers who looked upon the Precedent as dangerous to &s;ee Subjects in Arms, will be convinced, that, now we have broke through every Tie, and renounced all Dependence, we can no longer be Rebels, by openly commending our Proceedings, and taking up Arms in our Fa|vour. Rare Rea&s;oning in <HI>Common Sen&s;e!</HI> That Foreign Nations may be convinced we &s;eek nothing but Redre&s;s from our hitherto King and Parent State, we are to &s;hake off all Al|legiance, and engage with the Enemies of our Nation in War again&s;t him, we always called our Sovereign. Rare Rea&s;oning, truly! O <HI>Common Sen&s;e!</HI></P>
<P>What he calls his fourth Rea&s;on, is evi|dently no Rea&s;on at all, but only a Propo&s;al to publi&s;h a Manife&s;to of our Sufferings, an Apology for our Conduct, and an Offer to live peaceably with all Foreign Courts. &mdash;
<PB N="40" REF="47">
The Continental Congre&s;s has ordered a Nar|rative of <HI>American</HI> Sufferings to be publi&s;hed, which undoubtedly is very proper and nece&s;|&s;ary, but whether in Foreign Courts it will be productive of any more than Contempt of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter, and cold Pity and Prai&s;es of the <HI>Americans,</HI> Time mu&s;t &s;hew.</P>

Every Co|lony mu&s;t declare it&s;elf independent, before, agreeable to his Advice, they can all meet in Continental Conference, and throw the re|&s;pective Independence of each Province into one Common Stock. Should any two or three Colonies have an Aver&s;ion to Independence, and the Arguments of <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> be thought in&s;ufficient only in one of the Middle or more important Colonies, a Divi&s;ion in|&s;tantly takes Place; and if the others &s;hould attempt to reduce the refractory Colony, an inte&s;tine War is begun, and may &s;pread far more dangerous, as the Author ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, than all the Malice of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and be|fore every Colony has determined for it&s;elf, and fixed upon a Continental Conference, many Things may happen.</P>

<P>What may be the I&s;&s;ue of the Conte&s;t none can tell. <HI>"The Events of War,"</HI> &s;aith <HI>Com|mon Sen&s;e, "are uncertain;"</HI> but we may ex|pect it will be long. <HI>Holland</HI> &s;truggled about Seventy, and <HI>Switzerland</HI> Three Hundred Years, before they were univer&s;ally acknow|ledged Free States, but then they had not a Force &s;ufficient to repel all the World, though <HI>England,</HI> in&s;tead of being again&s;t them, did <HI>Holland</HI> con&s;iderable Service by de&s;troying the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Armada.</P>
<P>If <HI>America</HI> proceeds upon the Author's Plan, and declares again&s;t all Reconciliation and Con|nections with <HI>Great Britain,</HI> what mu&s;t fol|low is obvious. She will either fight till &s;he brings <HI>America</HI> to her Terms, or <HI>America</HI> mu&s;t fight till &s;he brings <HI>Great Britain</HI> to her's. Perhaps neither the one nor the other is impo&s;&s;ible; but how much Time and Trea|&s;ure, and how many Lives it may co&s;t, none can tell. In &s;hort, our Differences mu&s;t end either in the Overthrow of the one or the other, or mu&s;t be made up by Treaty at la&s;t. The Event may be dubious, but there can be no Doubt that Twenty Years Quietne&s;s, (were it only a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms,) would add Three Millions to the Inhabitants of <HI>Briti&s;h Ame|rica;</HI> and who&s;oever carries on determined and ju&s;t Mea&s;ures with the lea&s;t Ri&s;k, and greate&s;t Prudence, bids fairer to en&s;ure Suc|ce&s;s, than tho&s;e who precipitately hurry on

Matters to a Cri&s;is. If Time could be gained for the mo&s;t violent in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> &amp;c. to cool, it would do more towards healing our Difference, than either Force or Rea&s;on has done hitherto; but, as Mr. <HI>Burke,</HI> in his Speech, mo&s;t ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <HI>"In Civil Wars great Difficulties always attend moderate Men, who advi&s;e to lenient Mea&s;ures; their Modera|tion is attributed to Want of Zeal, and their Fears for the Publick Safety to a Want of Spi|rit."</HI> Again&s;t all &s;uch, Men who have Ends to an&s;wer, and Views to &s;erve, rai&s;e a for|midable Outcry, but the Tumult &s;oon &s;ub|&s;ides. Time will, in the long-run, prove a Friend to Rea&s;on, place every Man's Views, Character, and Actions, in a true Light, and fix everla&s;ting Di&s;grace upon all &s;uch as art|fully would have built their Greatne&s;s on their Country's Ruin; and he that is higher than the Highe&s;t, will finally render unto every Man, whether King or Subject, as his Works have been, whether they have been good or bad. Six Things he is &s;aid to hate, and the Seventh is even an Abomination to him, <HI>"It is he that &s;oweth Di&s;cord among Brethren."</HI></P>
