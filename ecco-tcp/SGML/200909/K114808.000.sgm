<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE va&s;t Number of Books which the Pen and Pre&s;s have
produced, has made all Lovers of Literature de&s;irous of knowing, by &s;ome
compendious Me|thods, what has been written in the &s;everal Sciences to which
they have appropriated their Studies: And this De&s;ire grows more importunate,
as the Difficulty encrea&s;es of &s;atisfying it; the Works of the Learned
multiplying &s;o much beyond the Accounts which are given of them, and our
Attention being engro&s;&s;ed to the Regard only of <HI>&s;ome</HI> few
Writers, by tho&s;e very means, which might be u&s;ed to give us a tolerable
notice of <HI>all,</HI> who any ways de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>For &s;everal Attempts have indeed been made, in many Countries,
to gratify in &s;ome mea&s;ure, this univer&s;al Cu|rio&s;ity; but in
<HI>England,</HI> e&s;pecially, by &s;uch narrow and cir|cum&s;cribed Schemes,
as have left many Impediments to the Advancement of human Knowledge unremov'd.
For thro' the Defect of &s;uch Intelligence, in its proper Extent; how many
AUTHORS have we, who are con&s;uming their Time, their Quiet and their Wits, in
&s;earching after that which is either pa&s;t finding, or already found? In
admiring at the Penetrations them&s;elves have made, tho' to the Rind only, in
tho&s;e very Branches of Science which their Fore|fathers have pierced to the
Pith? And how many, who <HI>would be</HI> Authors, as excellent as ever
appear'd, had they but &s;uch Plans or Models laid before them, as might induce
them to mar&s;hal their Thoughts into a regular Order; or did they but know
where to meet with Concurrence of Opinion, with Arguments, Authorities or
Examples, to corroborate and ripen their teeming Conceptions?</P>
<P>Again, had &s;uch Intelligence been di&s;per&s;ed in its due Scope
and Latitude, how many BOOKSELLERS, who would neither <HI>be impos'd</HI> upon
them&s;elves, with mere Tran&s;cripts <PB N="ii" REF="13"> of ob&s;olete and
ob&s;cure Works, for modern Compo&s;itions, nor <HI>impo&s;e upon others,</HI>
&s;o much to the Di&s;credit of their Trade, and, in the main, to their own
Di&s;advantage, either &s;uch injudicious Valuations of &s;ome old Books, or
&s;o many im|mature Publications of new ones; when the &s;ame Subjects are
already more &s;ignificantly handled at their very Elbows, but mourning in a
kind of Sackloth and A&s;hes, for that Re|vival, they might at a much ea&s;ier
Expence, be preferr'd to; knew the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors but where, even in their
own Shops to find them? Nor yet would they <HI>impo&s;e upon them&s;elves</HI>
the Lo&s;&s;es they often &s;o voluntarily do, of turning tho&s;e very Pieces
to Wa&s;te-paper, which to &s;ome Reader or other would be mo&s;t acceptable,
knew the one how to <HI>communicate,</HI> and the other, how to
<HI>compa&s;s</HI> the <HI>Contents</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, how many READERS, who would not be glad of attaining to
Knowledge the &s;horte&s;t way, &s;eeing the Orb thereof is &s;woln to &s;uch a
Magnitude, and Life but &s;uch a Span to gra&s;p it? How many, who have not
&s;ome Curio&s;ity to know the Foundations of tho&s;e Tenets upon which they
&s;o &s;ecurely tru&s;t their Under&s;tandings? Or where the Foot|&s;teps of
tho&s;e Precepts and Precedents may be found, which have given Direction to
&s;o many modern Performances? Who would not embrace the mo&s;t likely means to
detect the vile Grievance of Plagiari&s;m, and deter &s;o many
di&s;ad|vantageous Repetitions of the &s;ame thing? What Reader would not think
it convenient to be apprized of the Worth of Authors, before he gave them place
in his Study or E&s;teem, by &s;ome previous Characters or little Analy&s;is of
what is comprized in them? And who would not find it commo|dious to have the
opportunity of revi&s;ing the Library of which he is, he has been, or may be
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, in faithful Portraits thereof, at &s;uch Times and Places in
which he cannot come at the Originals? In a word, if he be ignorant, who would
not covet to enlarge his Knowledge? If he be knowing, who would not willingly
refre&s;h his Memory? And yet all the Expedients we have to accommodate the
Cu|rious with &s;o many <HI>De&s;iderata,</HI> are only &s;ome &s;uperficial
<HI>Catalogues,</HI> either of Authors, rather than their Works, or of the
Works of Authors only, in &s;ome one peculiar place of Education, or in &s;ome
&s;ingle Science; or el&s;e, tho&s;e which have been mo&s;t cur&s;orily taken
of &s;ome particular Libraries; and al&s;o a few <HI>Extracts,</HI> limited to
the Recom|mendation only of &s;ome modern Writers.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="14">As for our CATALOGUES of Books, they are
generally, and indeed nece&s;&s;arily, thro' the great Charge and Hurry which
attend the making and printing them at proper Junc|tures, &s;o &s;hort and
defective, that we cannot often under|&s;tand, by the two or three Words they
be&s;tow upon a Vo|lume, the very Title, nor &s;ometimes the Size, nor
frequently the Time when it was printed, much le&s;s the Matter treated of
therein: So that many Gentlemen, who live remote from the Places where our
Sales and Auctions are made, are, by the blind and doubtful Informations which
the&s;e Cata|logues afford them, both led to over-look &s;ome Books which they
have mo&s;t occa&s;ion for, and to give Commi&s;&s;ions for the Purcha&s;e of
others, by which they are utterly di&s;appointed, as an&s;wering in no wi&s;e
their Expectation. Nay, many who have Opportunities even of being pre&s;ent
where &s;uch Libra|ries are di&s;po&s;ed of, do &s;till, after Examination,
commonly meet with no le&s;s Di&s;appointment. For the bare and naked
<HI>Titles</HI> of Books, e&s;pecially &s;o contracted, are in&s;ufficient to
explain them at be&s;t, or when their Contents are ingenuou&s;ly de&s;ign'd to
be &s;ignified by the Titles; but, on the contrary, the Titles of many are
often mere Paradoxes, Enigmas, and even Contrarieties to the Subjects or
Arguments maintained in them; and are &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed, many times, thro'
Artifice, by the Authors, Editors, and Book&s;ellers them&s;elves, to de|ceive
the Purcha&s;er, and catch him by the Pur&s;e. This Deceit will la&s;t as long
as Books, if the other Expedient of <HI>Extracts</HI> is not more effectually
put in execution, than it has hitherto been done.</P>
<P>For EXTRACTS indeed would have prevented all the&s;e
In|conveniencies, had they been employ'd in a Scheme, only as comprehen&s;ive,
as it is obvious to be &s;ugge&s;ted. But tho' it is above fifty Years &s;ince
&s;uch Extracts of Books were fir&s;t publi&s;h'd in <HI>England,</HI> yet do
all, or the greate&s;t part which have been here made, re&s;pect only the Works
of a few con|temporary Writers; as if it were a &s;hame not to be ungrateful,
and trample tho&s;e Predece&s;&s;ors into Oblivion, by the help of who&s;e
Learning and Abilities, the Moderns have improved their own. But this is a very
partial and pernicious kind of Flattery, &s;o to celebrate and compliment the
Learning and Genius of the pre&s;ent Times, that Po&s;terity may not believe
any before them worthy of their notice: For tho&s;e who ex|tend not their
Knowledge beyond their own Age, mu&s;t not only lo&s;e the noble&s;t
Inheritance of their Ance&s;tors, but in|&s;truct their Succe&s;&s;ors to
imitate their Example, and deal <PB N="iv" REF="15"> the &s;ame mea&s;ure to
the <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> which the&s;e have dealt to the <HI>pa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, and many others, in which an intelli|gent
Reader might fore&s;tall us, we think it high time to be|gin with an
Undertaking which may include both tho&s;e Ex|pedients to their full Advantage,
in a <HI>Catalogue</HI> more com|plete, as to the <HI>Titles</HI> of Books,
which alone would be no incon&s;iderable Improvement upon what has been done,
and an <HI>Extract</HI> more unlimited, as to the Times in which they were
written, than have hitherto appear'd among us; &s;o as to facilitate the mo&s;t
u&s;eful Re&s;earches of the Living, by a general Regi&s;ter of, or Directory
to the mo&s;t notable Particulars in the Labours of the Dead.</P>
<P>And the more directly to pro&s;ecute this Attempt, it is
comprehended under the Title of the BRITISH LIBRARIAN: For not only becau&s;e
Matters of our own Ob&s;ervation are generally mo&s;t applicable to us, or
becau&s;e the running into Books of all Countries, would make it a Work of
which we could never hope to &s;ee any End, or tolerable Progre&s;s; but
chiefly becau&s;e our Pains and Re&s;pect are principally due to our own
Country; becau&s;e al&s;o &s;uch Service thereunto has been mo&s;t neglected;
and becau&s;e the Language thereof is mo&s;t exten&s;ively u&s;eful to our own
People, we &s;hall confine our|&s;elves to our own Authors; and &s;ome indeed
of tho&s;e Fo|reigners likewi&s;e, who are either become as it were
natura|liz'd among us, by Tran&s;lations, or have de&s;erved to be &s;o, by
treating of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Affairs.</P>
<P>By calling this Work of our LIBRARIAN a <HI>compendious
Review</HI> or <HI>Ab&s;tract,</HI> we propo&s;e not always a minute and entire
Epitome of every Book, which would make a Scheme of this Compa&s;s &s;o tedious
and voluminous, that we know not whether our Readers or our&s;elves would be
fir&s;t wearied in going thro' it. Be&s;ides, excellent Authors, &s;o &s;erv'd,
would never &s;atisfy curious Readers; and tho&s;e Authors who cannot claim
that Character, would either not de&s;erve &s;uch di&s;tinction, or not be
&s;uffer'd, by the Attention which others, equally de&s;erving, would al&s;o
demand, to exact &s;uch par|ticular Cognizance, in a Work of &s;uch a general
Nature. Our Bu&s;ine&s;s therefore cannot be &s;o much to delight Read|ers with
the Flowers of Books, or &s;atisfy them with a &s;mooth Contexture of all the
Rea&s;ons and Arguments in them, as to point out tho&s;e Heads or Topicks,
which, like &s;o many Streams and Rivulets that &s;everally ari&s;e in the
Provinces of Literature, may be&s;t direct them to the Fountains them|&s;elves,
<PB N="v" REF="16"> where every Reader will extract tho&s;e Parts, and tho&s;e
Proportions, which no Epitomi&s;t can do for him. So that by this Compendium of
Hints and Adverti&s;ements concerning the mo&s;t ob&s;ervable Per&s;ons and
Places, Times and Things, which have been &s;poken of in the Writings of Men,
is intended a <HI>Promptuary</HI> only, to the Search of tho&s;e Writings, as
the mo&s;t ready means to expedite the Attain|ment of what every one is
&s;eeking. For as the excellent Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> complains, 
<Q REND="inline">"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Augment.
Scientiarum, Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 5.</BIBL></NOTE>learned Men want &s;uch
<HI>Inven|tories</HI> of every thing in Art and Nature, as rich Men have of
their E&s;tates."</Q> Here then, we hope to &s;upply that Want, by giving not
only &s;uch Inventories of all tho&s;e things, but, at the &s;ame time, a
Reference to the Ob&s;erva|tions in their Authors which have been further made
on them; and not only that, but oftentimes what has been ob|&s;erved even of
the Authors al&s;o. And this more expre&s;ly, after pre&s;enting fir&s;t of all
their Titles, commonly at length, in a manner as agreeably diver&s;ified as the
Authors will con|veniently permit; &s;ometimes with Rea&s;ons for the Choice of
them; a tran&s;ient View of the Drift or De&s;ign, and Con|tents of tho&s;e we
revive; &s;ome Notice of their Vouchers and Authorities; &s;ome Sketches of
their chief Arguments or Examples; &s;ome Indication of their Method, and
In&s;tances of their Stile, occa&s;ionally, as they yield Matter mo&s;t likely
to be &s;erviceable; with Characters al&s;o &s;ometimes &s;ubjoin'd, which
others have given of them. And in this treatment of good old Authors, we hope
for the &s;ame effect, as in the pruning of good old Trees, in which the
Gardener does not pride him&s;elf with the Twigs which he cuts off, or throws
together, but expects that the Operation will be a means of making the Stocks
them&s;elves, from whence they grew, &s;hoot forth with fre&s;h Vigour, and
reward, with better Fruits, the Hands that &s;hall gather them.</P>
<P>By our mo&s;t <HI>Scarce, U&s;eful, and Valuable</HI> Books in all
Sciences, we intend the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all Times, from the mo&s;t
Ancient we can procure, to the mo&s;t Modern, in all Sizes, even Pamphlets as
well as bound Volumes. And here our Scheme is &s;o copious as to admit not only
of many which have been long buried in Darkne&s;s by their great Age, but
&s;ome, in a manner &s;o young, as never yet to have &s;een the Light of
Publication, being only in the Pre&s;s, or but going to it; and that, in a
Method, as may be hence gather'd, more &s;atisfactory than they are u&s;ually
notified to the Pub|lick. <PB N="vi" REF="17"> And becau&s;e we have received
hopes from &s;ome emi|nent and judicious Per&s;ons, who approve of this
Undertak|ing, that we &s;hall be favour'd from time to time with &s;everal
u&s;eful <HI>Manu&s;cripts</HI> which have long lain di&s;regarded, we
propo&s;e to enrich our Collections with a &s;hort Account al&s;o of one or
more in every Number.</P>
<P>For as to the <HI>Method of Publication,</HI> we find it mo&s;t
com|modious, that we may better admit the Communications of &s;uch as plea&s;e
to oblige us with their Corre&s;pondence, that it &s;hould be <HI>Monthly,</HI>
and in &s;uch a <HI>mi&s;cellaneous</HI> manner as may yield the greate&s;t
Variety; &s;o that every Number may be a little <HI>Pocket-Library,</HI>
de&s;cribing Folio's, Quarto's, Oc|tavo's, Pamphlets and Manu&s;cripts: By
which different Sizes, Readers, of different Circum&s;tances, may be the
ea&s;ier &s;uited in the Purcha&s;es they are inclin'd to. Then al&s;o, as
much, generally, as Opportunity will allow, of the various Sciences in every
Number, for the like Rea&s;on, that Read|ers of different Studies may the
&s;ooner be inform'd of what they are enquiring after. For a Publication
<HI>Topically</HI> di|ge&s;ted, or <HI>Chronologically,</HI> would be
impracticable, unle&s;s a Man had all the Books in the Kingdom together at
once, to methodize, before he &s;et out: And then it would be very
inconvenient, by attracting only one Set of Readers to that one Branch, and
making all the re&s;t wait till the Cour&s;e of their re&s;pective Studies
aro&s;e; by which they would yet lo&s;e many pertinent Digre&s;&s;ions upon
their own Subjects, which would occur in the different Sciences; for they
inter|change, and &s;ome Subjects are often to be found in Books of all
Sciences, while other Books would be denied admi&s;&s;ion under any one of
them, becau&s;e they do not di&s;tinctly pro|fe&s;s any, or directly treat of
all. Moreover, the Sale of &s;ome Sciences would, in that ca&s;e, be &s;o
unproportionable to o|thers, that it would be a great Di&s;couragement to the
Under|taking, and render the Edition of the whole, in many parts, incomplete.
Be&s;ides, this ab&s;tracted Revival of Books, in|dependent of each other, as
to the Subjects, was never ob|jected to any other Schemes of Abridgment, which
have been, or are carried on, in <HI>Latin, French,</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>;
the Readers well knowing, how ea&s;ily they may be directed to what they want,
by <HI>Tables</HI> and <HI>Indexes</HI> annexed to every Volume.</P>
<P>Thus we are not under any Anxiety about what Authors we &s;hall
commence with, or with whom we &s;hall conclude, &s;ince that which is look'd
for in this Number, may ari&s;e in <PB N="vii" REF="18"> the next: Nor are we
under any Apprehen&s;ion of being mi&s;con&s;trued to pledge our own Judgment
for the Merits of all the <HI>Authors</HI> we &s;hall revive, &s;ince whatever
they are <HI>e&s;|&s;entially,</HI> 'tis the Application of them, the U&s;e to
which they are converted, that makes them <HI>effectually</HI> good or bad;
wherefore, it is in the <HI>Readers</HI> Power to make few <HI>Authors</HI>
unworthy of &s;uch Revival. However, we &s;hall u&s;e our be&s;t Endeavours to
plea&s;e them, and always be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to better Judgments: So that if
any Improvement of our Undertaking &s;hall come to hand, we &s;hall gratefully
acknow|ledge, and cheerfully pur&s;ue it; if not, and the Encourage|ment of the
Publick &s;hall be proportionable to the Indu&s;try we be&s;tow upon this
Scheme, we hope that any Imperfec|tions in our execution thereof, will bear no
proportion to the Benefits which may univer&s;ally flow from it.</P>

<P>THIS being the mo&s;t ancient <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torian
ex|tant, demands the fir&s;t Place in our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Library. Some
Particulars relating to the Author, with the different Editions and Character
of his Work, we refer to the bottom of the Page<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We
&s;hall not here trouble our Reader with di&s;tingui&s;hing two other Per&s;ons
of the &s;ame Name with our Author, &s;ince none of their genuine Works remain,
at lea&s;t in Hi&s;tory. 'Tis enough to ob&s;erve that this GILDAS, called
<HI>Badonicus,</HI> becau&s;e &s;aid to be born at <HI>Bath,</HI> for his
&s;ingular Prudence and the Se|verity of his Morals, was &s;urnamed the WISE;
that he was Monk of <HI>Bangor</HI>; flouri&s;h'd in the middle of the &s;ixth
Century, and lived to about the end of the third part thereof, as may ap|pear
by this Treati&s;e <HI>De Excidio Britanniae,</HI> the only one of his writing
extant, as Arch-bp <HI>U&s;her</HI> a&s;&s;ures it to be. He wrote it in
<HI>Latin,</HI> in a Stile according to that Age, har&s;h and per|plexed
enough; and the fir&s;t Edition of it, publi&s;hed by <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI>
in 8vo. <HI>London,</HI> 1525. and dedicated to <HI>Cuthbert Ton&s;tal</HI> Bp.
of <HI>Durham,</HI> was from an incorrect Copy; re-printed at <HI>Ba&s;il</HI>
1541. and at <HI>London</HI> 1568. This la&s;t Edition, or another much about
the &s;ame time, which <HI>John Jo&s;&s;eline</HI> gave of it from an|other MS.
is but little more perfect than that fir&s;t, which was remitted into the
<HI>Bibliotheca Patrum:</HI> But the late&s;t and be&s;t is in Dr.

Florent.</HI> al&s;o more briefly in <HI>Bale, Pits,</HI> and <HI>Fuller</HI>'s
Worthies; which la&s;t wonders, not without Rea&s;on, that <HI>Gerard
Vo&s;&s;ius</HI> &s;hould attribute a Comedy in <HI>Plautus</HI> to this our
<HI>Gildas,</HI> upon &s;uch &s;lender Grounds as he there mentions. As to his
Character, <HI>Milton</HI> tells us, That <HI>Gildas</HI> is every way
preferable, in &s;peaking of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Wars, to the <HI>Saxon</HI>
Writers, and a good Rea&s;on he gives for it: becau&s;e <HI>Gildas</HI> was
nothing conceited of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Valour, whereas the <HI>Saxons</HI>
ever magnified their own Deeds. Vide <HI>Mils. Hi&s;t. of Brit.</HI> Lib.
3.</NOTE>. But the Subject Matter of this <PB N="2" REF="25"> <HI>Epi&s;tle to
the Britains,</HI> and his Method of handling it, may be be&s;t gathered from
the Arguments he briefly touches upon, under di&s;tinct Heads in the following
Order.</P>
<P N="1">1. Of the I&s;land, its Situation and Extent; the number of
its Cities, the Magnificence of its Buildings, and Fertility of its Soil. 2.
The Di&s;obedience of the People, both in Religion and Government; their
mon&s;trous Idols before the Introduction of Chri&s;tianity, and their
Character by <HI>Porphiry,</HI> for their dete&s;table Tyrants. Then he
propo&s;es to recount their Sufferings under the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, not
from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Authors, they being de&s;troyed by their Foes, or
tran&s;ported by their Exiles; but from foreign Accounts. So pa&s;&s;es to, 3.
The Subjection of the I&s;land, and how tamely &s;he received the foreign Yoke.
4. Of her Rebellion under Queen <HI>Boadicia</HI>; her neglect to &s;ecure her
Conque&s;ts by Sea and Land; and final Overthrow; which intro|duced, 5. Her
&s;econd Subjection and dreadful Slavery, till, 6. Her &s;econd Relief by
<HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI>; which produced 7. Her Per&s;ecution under
<HI>Diocle&s;ian</HI>; and, 8. Many holy Martyrs; as, <HI>Alban</HI> of
<HI>Verolam,</HI> with <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Julius</HI> of <HI>Carlile,</HI>
be&s;ides many others not here named: al&s;o of their triumphant State till, 9.
The <HI>Arian</HI> Here&s;y; and 10. The U&s;urpation and Tyranny of
<HI>Maximus,</HI> followed by, 11. The Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Scots</HI> and
<HI>Picts.</HI> 12. Their Ex|pul&s;ion by the <HI>Romans</HI>; 13. The
Re-inva&s;ion by tho&s;e Neighbours; 14. And &s;econd Deliverance by the
<HI>Romans,</HI> who having taught the <HI>Britains</HI> to arm them&s;elves,
and fortify their Country, take their la&s;t Farewell. 15. Of the third 
<PB N="3" REF="26"> wa&s;tful Spoil by the afore&s;aid Enemy. 16. And by a
de|vouring Famine. 17. Of their pitiful but fruitle&s;s Addre&s;s to the
<HI>Roman</HI> Con&s;ul <HI>Agitius.</HI> 18. Of the brave Re&s;i&s;tance to
which &s;ome of them were driven by Nece&s;&s;ity; and the Victory they
obtained again&s;t their Enemies, by whom they were for&s;aken, tho' not by
their Iniquities. Therefore, 19. Of their Vices, and the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s
which followed their Peace and Plenty: Their Choice of wicked Princes, and the
Corruption of their Pa&s;tors. 20. The &s;udden A|larm of their inveterate
Enemies. 21. And new Calamities by Pe&s;tilence. 22. Of their Councils to
redre&s;s them&s;elves. 23. And Invitation of their far mo&s;t cruel Enemy the
<HI>Sax|ons</HI> to aid them again&s;t the Northern Powers. 24. Who totally
wa&s;te and &s;poil the Country. 25. The mi&s;erable State of the fugitive
<HI>Britains</HI>; their gathering head under <HI>Aurelius Ambro&s;ius</HI>;
Battle with and Victory over the <HI>Sax|ons.</HI> 26. Of the la&s;t Victory
obtained by the <HI>Britains</HI> again&s;t them at the Siege of the Mountain
of <HI>Bath</HI> (or <HI>Badon-Hill</HI>) forty four Years and one Month after
the landing of the <HI>Sax|ons,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>the Time of my
Nativity,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Gildas.</HI> In this Article, the mo&s;t ob&s;ervable
of all the re&s;t, as being now enter'd into the times of his own Knowledge,
our Author fir&s;t bewails, and &s;harply reproves the Depravity of the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Rulers in general; next, gives particular Characters of five
of them; beginning with the Tyrant <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> then living, his
Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, the Murders he committed under the Habit of the Saintly
<HI>Amphabale,</HI> his Adulteries and other Impieties. Then proceeds to
<HI>Aurelius Conanus,</HI> whom he reproaches in like manner: With equal
Severity he &s;courges <HI>Vortiper,</HI> a wicked Son of a good King. Nor does
he le&s;s cha&s;ti&s;e <HI>Cunegla&s;&s;e,</HI> that <HI>golden Butcher,</HI>
as his Name inports; and concludes with the like Execrations a|gain&s;t that
<HI>Dragon</HI> of the <HI>I&s;land, Maglocune,</HI> who &s;urpa&s;&s;ed many
Tyrants, as in Power, &s;o in Mi&s;chief. Here he &s;ub|joins the Menaces
denounced again&s;t the&s;e and &s;uch like wicked Princes, by the &s;acred
Oracles of Holy Scripture. After which follows a Tran&s;ition from the
<HI>Civil</HI> to the <HI>Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Corruptions; and here he
inveighs again&s;t the Vices of the Clergy no le&s;s freely than he had done
again&s;t tho&s;e in the State; which, with &s;everal Examples from the New
Te&s;tament and &s;ome Fathers of the Church, concludes this his <HI>Epi&s;tle
to the Britains.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Tran&s;lation</HI> of the &s;aid <HI>Epi&s;tle,</HI>
appears to have been made near the fir&s;t Entrance of the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI>
Line upon the <PB N="4" REF="27"> Throne of <HI>England</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho' this Tran&s;lation of <HI>Gildas</HI> was made at the
Beginning of K. <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, we meet with no earlier Edition of it
in Print than that publi&s;h'd 8vo. 1638, and it was not improbably
re-publi&s;hed now again in 1652, on account of the &s;harp and Chri&s;tian
Reproofs therein of Kings and Prie&s;ts. The Editor &s;ays, That in rendering
this into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> much Faith has been ob&s;erved; by which you may
di&s;cover the Author &s;till the &s;ame, though in his Apparel fa&s;hioned to
the Time; in peru&s;ing of whom, the Reader &s;hall find that, <HI>Impiety is
the great De&s;troyer of Empires, and that Kingdom which remains mo&s;t
immaculate from Sin, &s;tands &s;afe&s;t from Ruin.</HI></NOTE>, as the Editor
tells us, and while the Tran&s;lator was under &s;ome Confinement, as he
informs us him&s;elf in his large <HI>Introduction to the Inhabitants of the
I&s;land;</HI> which further contains, chiefly &s;ome Apologies for
<HI>Gildas,</HI> as to his u&s;ing &s;o much Scripture Application, and that,
not according to the vulgar Ver&s;ion, as <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> has
ob&s;erv'd; with an An&s;wer al&s;o to this Author's erro|neous Ob&s;ervation
upon the <HI>Diocle&s;ian</HI> Per&s;ecution from <HI>Gildas</HI> him&s;elf.
Then he &s;trives more favourably to inter|pret the Invectives wherewith
<HI>Gildas</HI> has been accu&s;ed to have a&s;per&s;ed the <HI>Britains</HI>
by Sir <HI>John Price</HI>; as that our Author having already recorded their
prai&s;e-worthy Deeds in his <HI>Chronicle,</HI> cited by <HI>Henry</HI> of
<HI>Huntington,</HI> intended now to admoni&s;h them of their reproveable
Actions only in this <HI>Epi&s;tle,</HI> according to what <HI>Gildas</HI>
&s;ays in his own <HI>Prologue</HI> to it: 
<Q REND="inline">"That he does not now determine &s;o much to
re|port the Dangers of the bloody Battles of mo&s;t valiant Sol|diers, as the
Perils of &s;lothful Men."</Q> In like manner, the Tran&s;lator excu&s;es the
Character of &s;o much Barbarity given to the <HI>Scotch, Picts,</HI> and
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> by our Author, as al&s;o his hard Cen&s;ures of the
<HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; &s;o de&s;cends from the ancient
<HI>Union</HI> of the&s;e Nations, to that which was then on foot between the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> (including the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>) and the <HI>Scotch</HI>;
and becau&s;e of K. <HI>James</HI>'s De&s;cent from the Blood Royal of the&s;e

printed at the Beginning of our <HI>Reformation</HI>; and tho' the Au|thor's
Name was not yet publi&s;h'd to it, it is well known to have been written by
that famous Clerk and Schoolman WILLIAM of OCCHAM, &s;o called from being born
in a Village of that Name in <HI>Surrey,</HI> as <HI>Camden</HI> and others
have ob&s;erv'd. It was written by our Author &s;o early as the Year 1305, if
the MS. Note on the Copy before me is right. There was another E|dition of it
afterwards in 1540, wherein it is &s;aid to be written by <HI>William</HI> of
<HI>Occham,</HI> the great Philo&s;opher, in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and
<HI>Latin.</HI> [<HI>Extat. Lat. in Golda&s;t. Monarch. T. Ed.</HI>] The Author
was Scholar to <HI>John Duns Scotus,</HI> and afterwards, his Antagoni&s;t. In

Father of the <HI>Reals,</HI> and <HI>Occham</HI> of the <HI>Nominals.
Occham,</HI> flu&s;hed with his Succe&s;s, undertook Pope <HI>John</HI> the
23d, and gave a mortal Wound to his <HI>Temporal Power over Princes.</HI> He
got a good Guardian, <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Bavaria</HI> the Emperor, who&s;e
Court was his Sanctuary, but he was excommunicated by the Pope; and the
Ma&s;ters of <HI>Paris</HI> condemned him for an Heretic, and burnt his Books;
which <HI>Fuller</HI> conceives to be the Cau&s;e why <HI>Luther</HI> was &s;o
vers'd in his Works, which he had at his Fingers ends; being the &s;ole

<P>THis notable little Tract was written to &s;ilence the Clergy, and
an&s;wer their unrea&s;onable Expectations, that the Pope might exerci&s;e a
Juri&s;diction over the Temporalities of <PB N="6" REF="29"> Princes, and the
Church be exempted from contributing of its Riches in time of need, either for
the Relief of the Poor or the Security of the Nation where they abide; as may
ap|pear by the following Ab&s;tract thereof.</P>
<P>CLERICUS begins with complaining how much the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
Rights are invaded, and what wrongs the Clergy endure again&s;t all Law. MILES
asks him, what Law is? And he an&s;wers; the Ordinances of the Popes, and
Decrees of the Fathers. MILES allows that what they have hereto|fore ordain'd
in Matters of Temporality, may be Law to the Clergy, but not to the Laity; none
having power to ordain Statutes of Things, over which they have no Lord|&s;hip;
therefore, that he, lately, laugh'd heartily, when he heard that Pope
<HI>Boniface</HI> VIII. had made a new Statute, that he him&s;elf &s;hould be
above all &s;ecular Princes and King|doms; and that he needed but to put it
into Writing, and all things were his: If he would have my Ca&s;tle, my Town,
my Field, my Money, or the like, he need but to will, to write, and decree it,
and he's entitled to tho&s;e Things. Then CLERICUS would derive this Authority
from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf: To whom it is &s;aid in the <HI>P&s;alms, Ask
of me and I will give Nations to thine Heritage, and all the World about to thy
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion:</HI> And of whom it is written, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. <HI>That
he is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI> Then he argues from the
<HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Holy Church,</HI> that <HI>Peter</HI> was ordain'd
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s full Vicar for him&s;elf and Succe&s;&s;ors, &s;o has the
&s;ame Power over Temporalities as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had. But here MILES
di&s;tingui&s;hes two States of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; one of his Humility, the
other of his Power and Maje&s;ty: The former, from the Time that he took
Fle&s;h and Blood to his Pa&s;&s;ion; the latter, after his Re|&s;urrection;
when he &s;aid, <HI>All Power is given to me in Hea|ven and Earth:</HI> That
<HI>Peter</HI> was ordain'd <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Vicar for the State of his
Humility, and to follow him in tho&s;e Things which he did in that State, or to
exerci&s;e that Power which <PB N="7" REF="30"> he, as mortal Man, did; and not
that which after his Glo|rification he receiv'd. Here it is proved from
Scripture that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> neither had, nor pretended to a temporal
Kingdom; and that <HI>Peter</HI> had not by his Commi&s;&s;ion the Keys of the
Kingdom of Earth given him, but of Heaven; that he was <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s
Vicar in the Godly Kingdom of Souls, and not in <HI>Temporal Lord&s;hip</HI> of
Ca&s;tles and Lands: And this again is proved out of St. <HI>Paul.</HI> Then
CLERICUS flies to another Argument; for &s;eeing it allow'd that Holy Church
may correct Sins, he infers, that he who has to do in the know|ledge of Sin,
mu&s;t know and deem in Right and Wrong; and &s;ince there is Right and Wrong
in Temporal Matters, the Pope ought con&s;equently to rule and deem in Temporal
Cau&s;es. But MILES having &s;hew'd the Ab&s;urdity of this Sophi&s;m, and that
Right and Wrong in Temporal Matters, are to be judg'd by Temporal Laws, proves
this al&s;o out of Scripture; where even in ca&s;e of the People's
Di&s;obedience to tho&s;e Laws, it appears the Clergy are only to admoni&s;h
and warn them that they be <HI>&s;ubject to Princes,</HI> and in an|other Place
that <HI>every Soul</HI> &s;hall be <HI>&s;ubject</HI> to the <HI>higher
Powers;</HI> which excepts not the Clergy them&s;elves. 
<Q REND="inline">"And if you will needs be knowing in &s;uch
Cau&s;es, &s;ays he, be|cau&s;e Wrong and Sin are link'd together; it belongs
to you to know and deem in Cau&s;es of Wedlock; I pray will you therefore &s;ay
it follows, that you &s;hall know and deem of all that belongeth thereto, for
the <HI>knitting of the Deed?</HI>"</Q> So advi&s;es him not to intermeddle in
the Judg|ment of Things which concern Temporality; 
<Q REND="inline">"For &s;o much as ye u&s;urp and take upon you
that which belongs to others, it is right mete that ye &s;uffer as ye do."</Q>
Then CLERICUS asks if he can deny that the Temporal Power &s;hould be
&s;erviceable to the Spiritual? MILES allows the Temporality &s;hould be &s;o
far &s;erviceable to them, as to find tho&s;e who wor&s;hip and &s;erve God all
that is nece&s;&s;ary for them; that in the old Law they were hand&s;omely
provided for, but not thereby ordain'd any Temporal Kingdom or Lord&s;hip; for
what kind of Lord&s;hip was appointed the Mi|ni&s;try, may appear from four or
five Places of Scripture here quoted: from whence it is demanded, 
<Q REND="inline">"Lo to whom doth <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his
Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> liken you? To Work|men, to hired Men, and Oxen; and not
to Kings. I pray you, be Workmen, and hired Men, Lords of Things? Then it
&s;eemeth that <HI>Temporalities</HI> are granted you to help your Living, and
for Charge of Spiritual Admini|&s;tration, <PB N="8" REF="31"> and not for
<HI>Lord&s;hip:</HI> And of the <HI>Spiritual,</HI> it is written in the Law of
<HI>Mo&s;es</HI>; there ye be likened to an Ox that thre&s;hes; for which it is
enough to take his Meat, though he fill all the Barn with his Travail."</Q> A
little far|ther CLERICUS is for allowing Princes to enjoy their Tem|poralities,

<Q REND="inline">"And let them &s;uffer us, &s;ays he, in Peace
with ours."</Q> But MILES cannot allow this to be any ways rea|&s;onable. For,
&s;ays he, we are to &s;ee the Wills of our Fore|fathers fulfill'd, who gave
you the&s;e Temporalities &s;o plen|tifully, that you &s;hould di&s;po&s;e both
of them and your&s;elves to charitable Purpo&s;es, to the Health of our Souls
and the Honour of God, to praying for the Dead and relieving the Wants of the
Living; 
<Q REND="inline">"But ye do nothing &s;o; ye &s;pend away your
Temporality in &s;inful Deeds and Vanity; ye recke not for Hone&s;ty, no nor
for your own Law, nor for Dedes of Mercy and Charity, but in folly, and
<HI>bo|bance,</HI> and in liking of this World, ye di&s;pend all that was given
you for an holy Intent. Shall not his Wages be &s;topped who will not do Deeds
of <HI>Knighthood?</HI> He that holdeth of another, and doth not his due Office
and Ser|vice, he &s;hall lo&s;e and forgo his <HI>Fee.</HI>"</Q> Here he brings
in the Example of K. <HI>Joas,</HI> who would not let <HI>Joidas</HI> re|ceive
any more of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Revenue, but apply it to the Reparation of
God's Hou&s;e; and concludes this Ar|gument with ob&s;erving, 
<Q REND="inline">"That ye have received all &s;uch Lord&s;hips and
Riches as the Wages of holy Chivalry, and to the Intent to have Cloth and Food;
with which two, the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, he held him paid; and all the
o|ver-plus, be&s;ides Cloth and Food, ye ought to &s;pend in Deeds of Mercy and
Piety, as on poor People, that have need, and on &s;uch as be &s;ick and
di&s;ea&s;ed, and oppre&s;&s;ed with Mi&s;ery: And if ye do not &s;o, then
mu&s;t <HI>we have to do therewith</HI>; for then it falleth to us to take heed
of your Temporality, that ye beguile not and deceive the Quick and the
Dead."</Q> CLERICUS ob&s;erves, that King <HI>Joas</HI> did not apply the Money
to his own U&s;e, but to that of Holy Church. 
<Q REND="inline">"But now-a-days ye take our Goods, which ye
&s;pend not to the U&s;e of Holy Church, but on your bu&s;y and unruly
Soldiers, and on Ships and Engines of War."</Q> MILES an&s;wers, 
<Q REND="inline">"That neither does the King apply it to his own
U&s;e, but for your Safeguard, the De|fence of Holy Church, and of your Goods
and Chattels. That if the King's Power &s;hould fail, the Gentry, &s;uch as are
needy and had prodigally con&s;umed their Sub&s;tance, <PB N="9" REF="32">
would turn to yours, and de&s;troy all you have; therefore that the King's
Strength is to you as a &s;trong Wall, and his Peace is your Peace: That by
giving a little Portion to him, you buy your own Safeguard: But as ye have
al|ways been unkind for the Goodne&s;s he hath done, &s;o now ye complain
again&s;t what is your own Profit: That if Kings at their own Co&s;ts and Peril
are to defend you, and you to re&s;t, in Idlene&s;s and Luxury, eating,
drinking, and &s;olacing your&s;elves, then you only are Kings, and they your
Slaves."</Q> Then he proves from Scripture again, that the Church, or Riches of
it, &s;hould not be &s;pared when Chri&s;tian People are in Danger; 
<Q REND="inline">"The Gho&s;tly Temple, which is Mankind, being of
more worth than the Tem|ple that is made of Lime and Stone."</Q> CLERICUS
ob|jects that if tho&s;e things which are once given to God may be taken away
again, then all Vows may be made void. But MILES di&s;tingui&s;hes, that what
he has &s;aid is not to with|draw &s;uch Gifts, but to apply them to tho&s;e
U&s;es for which they were fir&s;t given. Then CLERICUS would allude from the
Words of our Saviour, how free the Clergy were from paying Tribute to Princes.
But MILES argues, that the Example he produces, and the an&s;wer therein given,
was for Chri&s;t, and not for you; however grants, that Clerks in their own
Per&s;ons &s;hould be free, but not &s;uch as lead their Lives as lewd Men.
Yet, tho' &s;ome may be thus freed in their Per&s;on by the Privilege of
Princes, &s;hall your Fields have now the &s;ame Freedom? And he who had before
a yearly Tribute from them, lo&s;e it afterwards in you? The Commonwealth
mu&s;t be defended at the Co&s;t of the Com|monalty; and whatever Part thereof
enjoys this Defence, 'tis mo&s;t agreeing with right, that he &s;et his
Shoulder and help to bear the Burden: Then if Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are as
rightly &s;ubject to the common Charge as to the yearly Rent, he &s;hall be
under Charge whoever owns them. If ye talk of Pre&s;cription; we an&s;wer, in
as much longer as this Free|dom, or Exemption has been allow'd by the Benignity
of Princes, &s;o much the &s;ooner ye &s;hould be ready to pay your Part where
need requires it; but both holy Writ and civil Powers aboli&s;h this
Pre&s;cription, as appears by Examples here cited. CLERICUS thinks it hard that
Kings &s;hould re&s;ume the Privileges granted by their Predece&s;&s;ors. But
MILES urges that any particular Privilege, however long or firmly granted,
mu&s;t &s;ubmit to general Occa&s;ions; and, if it be found hurtful to the
Commonwealth, may be repeal'd <PB N="10" REF="33"> in time of need, as
<HI>Solomon,</HI> in &s;ome Matters of Theft, changed &s;omewhat even of God's
Law CLERICUS would in&s;inuate, that it was Emperors who e&s;tabli&s;h'd
the&s;e Things, and that they might guide the Reins of the Law, but not Kings.
MILES looks upon this as a kind of Bla&s;phemy, proceeding either from
Ignorance or Envy; &s;o draws an In&s;tance from <HI>France</HI> and the
Empire, &s;hewing how di|&s;tinctly and independently the one exerci&s;es its
Power from the other. That as the Emperor may make Laws over all his Empire,
and add or dimini&s;h as he thinks good; &s;o may the King of <HI>France</HI>
either utterly repel the Emperor's Laws, or change, or clearly bani&s;h them,
and at his Plea&s;ure or|dain new ones. This he concludes with &s;everal
Examples from Scripture, proving the Subjection of the Clergy to their Princes;
as how by anointing, they acknowledg'd them to be their Princes and Rulers, how
they guarded, attended on, and pray'd for them as &s;uch, in&s;omuch that
CLERICUS cannot forbear breaking off the Conference, with ob&s;erving that it
was drawing towards Night, but he'd an&s;wer it all in the Morning.</P>
<P>AFTER this manner ends this ancient and remarkable Treati&s;e,
thus publi&s;h'd in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with expre&s;s Priviledge, by K.
<HI>Henry</HI>'s Printer, no doubt to forward and &s;trengthen the
<HI>Reformation</HI> then in its Infancy. But if the Reader would &s;ee this
Argument, on the King's <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Supremacy,</HI> as it more
particularly regards the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, deduced from a va&s;t
Variety of our mo&s;t authentic In&s;truments and Records, we mu&s;t refer him
to Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI>'s voluminous Collections on that Head, in three Volumes
Folio, of which we &s;hall here next take a &s;hort Survey, becau&s;e of the
Af|finity of the Subject, and its being traced from the earlie&s;t times;
however the Author is thereby ranged in this Num|ber before &s;ome others who
were earlier Writers.</P>

This Vol. has 1070 Pages, (allowing 224 which it begins at, wanting or

<P>THis &s;econd Volume, which was fir&s;t printed, is dedicated to
<HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> Lord Chancellor of
<HI>Eng|land,</HI> &amp;c. who appears therein to have been a principal
En|courager of this Work.</P>
<P>The Author has prefix'd to this Tome a brief nece&s;&s;ary
<HI>Introduction</HI> of 80 Pages, to &s;upply the want of his <HI>larger
In|troduction</HI> <PB N="15" REF="38"> compri&s;ed in the fir&s;t Book of the
fir&s;t Tome, not yet compleated, and over-large to be annexed to this, as he
at fir&s;t de&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>This Tome, as tho&s;e intended to &s;ucceed it, principally
con&s;i&s;ts of memorable Records (in the Tower of <HI>London</HI>) not
formerly publi&s;hed, intermixed with Hi&s;torical Pa&s;&s;ages out of our
mo&s;t ancient Hi&s;torians of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Religion writing in or
neare&s;t the&s;e Times. They are printed in their proper Dialects, the better
to be communicated to fo|reign Countries, and prevent all Cavils again&s;t
their Tran&s;la|tions. All the &s;aid Records are carefully compar'd by the
Author him&s;elf with the Originals, which may &s;erve to cor|rect, ratify and
illu&s;trate many ob&s;cure Pa&s;&s;ages in our Hi|&s;torians, Chronologers,
and King <HI>John</HI>'s printed Charter, and &s;upply many ob&s;ervable
Defects of Bulls, Patents, Writs, Records, Tran&s;actions, relating to the
Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Supre|macy of our Kings.</P>
<P>In his <HI>Preface</HI> to his Readers, he &s;peaks of others who
had cur&s;orily handled the Subject, as, Sir <HI>Ed. Coke,</HI> Sir <HI>John
Davis,</HI> Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Sybthorp,</HI> and his learned Friend Sir
<HI>Roger Twi&s;den</HI>; but never before chronologically and hi&s;to|rically
vindicated and demon&s;trated by any Lawyers, Anti|quaries, Hi&s;torians,
Chronologers, or Divines. Then he gives his Rea&s;ons for praeponing this
&s;econd Volume, in point of Publication before the fir&s;t. The U&s;es and
Benefits of it to our Kings and their Officers of State, Prelates, Divines,
Judges, Lawyers, Nobility and Gentry in both Kingdoms, and all Profe&s;&s;ors

<HI>Rome</HI>; their fictitious Titles; their Practices and Doctrines; the

which are here ranged in an Hi&s;torical Order, and each referr'd to its proper
Place in the &s;aid la&s;t Reign, according as their Dates, or other
Cir|cum&s;tances directed him, together with the Pages and Lines where they
mo&s;t properly may be in&s;erted in the next E|dition. With this Supplement
the whole Work fini&s;hes at Page 1307. Then comes an Adverti&s;ement to the
Readers, informing us of fourteen &s;everal Tables he had made to this third
Tome, in an Alphabetical and Chronological Method, after the Manner of the
preceeding Volume: And we are referr'd to &s;uch Tables in this la&s;t Volume
al&s;o, at the End of its Table of Contents. But &s;uch Tables or Indexes were
omitted, at lea&s;t in a very fair Set of the&s;e &s;carce and elabo|rate
Books, whence this &s;hort View of them is extracted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This la&s;t Volume of Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI>'s &s;aid
<HI>Records</HI> was de&s;ign'd, by him, to have borne the &s;ame Title with
the two former, as may appear in the Book it&s;elf; but the Author dying ju&s;t
before it was publi&s;h'd, tho&s;e who were concern'd in the Edition call'd it
<HI>The Hi&s;tory of King John,</HI> &amp;c. in hopes that appearing (under
that more general Title,) in the Shape and Di&s;gui&s;e of an entire Work, it
would go off the more readily, as Bi&s;hop <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> has
&s;ugge&s;ted; but with what Propriety, or Regard to the Subject, is left for
others to con&s;ider. 'Tis certain that neither of the three Volumes have been
&s;o &s;ufficiently u&s;ed by, or even known to &s;uc|ceeding Writers of, or
upon our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, as &s;uch copious Materials, &s;o
carefully collected, do de&s;erve. One Rea&s;on, no doubt, is, the Scarcity of
the two former Volumes; which are advanced to &s;uch an extraordinary Price,
that it is well known, the <HI>Complete Set</HI> has been &s;old for <HI>Thirty
Pounds.</HI> Another rea&s;on for their having lain &s;o much in Ob&s;curity,
might be, &s;ome pub|lick Puni&s;hment the Author once underwent, for writing
an|other <PB N="21" REF="44"> Book, but in the former Reign, and long before he
was <HI>Keeper</HI> of the <HI>Records</HI>; for which he yet had a hand&s;ome
Re|compence a&s;&s;ign'd him by the Parliament, however it might leave &s;ome
Di&s;ta&s;te to his Name upon the Minds of many; as we may el&s;ewhere
ob&s;erve. The la&s;t cau&s;e of their Neglect may be, that artful Di&s;regard
which has been in&s;inuated of the&s;e <HI>Col|lections,</HI> to abate the
Curio&s;ity of the Laity, and di&s;&s;uade their looking into them. The Right
Reverend Author la&s;t quoted, &s;peaking of tho&s;e two Tomes which peri&s;h'd
in the Fire of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> adds, 
<Q REND="inline">"And no Man has hitherto thought it worth his
Ex|pence and While to give us a new Edition from any of the few that e&s;caped:

any Printer's Name, or Date when printed. The late Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> in his

of</HI> London, <HI>who liv'd</HI> 1519: Whence probably that Copy might want
the whole fir&s;t Chapter; at the End whereof (which gives it the Name of a

Imaginations of the gro&s;&s;e witted. Unto which, PHILONICUS (&s;upplying the

therefore am con&s;trained to find out the Pathe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q> At
<HI>Norwich,</HI> the 18th of <HI>July,</HI> 1559.</P>
<P>The whole Work is divided into five Books, in the fir&s;t whereof,
after &s;ome general Heads, leading to that Know|ledge in Arithmetic and
Geometry, which is requi&s;ite for this Art, he defines Co&s;mography and
Geometry: Then gives you three Figures or Pictures; the fir&s;t repre&s;enting
<HI>Co&s;mography,</HI> by a Globe of the Heavens, containing the Earth; the
&s;econd, <HI>Geography,</HI> repre&s;enting the Earth and Waters only; and the
la&s;t, <HI>Chorography,</HI> or the Repre&s;enta|tion of &s;ome one Town or
City, which he illu&s;trates by an <HI>accurate Map</HI> of the excellent City
of NORWYCHE, as the Forme of it is, &s;ays he, at this pre&s;ent 1558; with
many Alphabetical References to an Explanation, at the bottom, of the principal
Places &s;et forth in the &s;ame, (which Map has been look'd upon as a very
great Curio&s;ity:) Hence he proceeds to define what the <HI>World</HI> is, and
to &s;hew that it is made of <HI>two Parts.</HI> The Number al&s;o of the
<HI>Heavens</HI>; with the Errors of &s;ome Ancients. That only eight Hea|vens
were found out by the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> that <HI>Ptolemy</HI> found out the
ninth, and <HI>Alphon&s;us</HI> the tenth: So gives us a Fi|gure of the
<HI>Coele&s;tial Sphere.</HI> Next he de&s;cribes what a <HI>Cen|tre</HI> is,
what the <HI>Axis,</HI> and what a <HI>Diameter</HI>; what the <HI>Poles</HI>
are, what an <HI>oblique Sphere,</HI> how a Sphere differs from a
<HI>Circle.</HI> The <HI>Number</HI> of Circles in a Sphere, what the
<HI>Ho|rizon</HI> is, the Divi&s;ion of it, with Figures of the &s;everal
&s;orts; what the <HI>Meridian</HI> is, the <HI>Zenith, Antipodes,</HI> the
<HI>Equinoctial</HI>; with the U&s;e of the <HI>Horizon, Meridian,</HI> and
<HI>Equinoctial Circles:</HI> What the <HI>Zodiac</HI> is, and the
<HI>Ecliptic,</HI> what a <HI>Sign</HI> is, what a <HI>Degree,</HI> and what a
<HI>Minute</HI>; with the <HI>Septentrio|nal</HI> Signes, <HI>Meridional</HI>
Signes, and the U&s;e of the <HI>Zodiac.</HI> A <HI>Table</HI> of many notable
fixed <HI>Stars,</HI> with their &s;everal Names, their true Longitude,
Latitude, and Declination, faithfully rectified unto the Year 1559, profitable
for finding out the Latitude of any Country or Place. Then we have the two
Declinations of every <HI>Planet</HI> di&s;tingui&s;h'd, with the Diver&s;ity
of the Sun's Declination from <HI>Ptolemy</HI>'s Time to ours, and the Manner
how to find out, by a Quadrant, the Sun's Declination. After which we have a
<HI>Table,</HI> in two <PB N="29" REF="52"> Parts, of <HI>Declination</HI> of
the <HI>Ecliptic,</HI> in <HI>Degrees, Minutes,</HI> and <HI>Seconds,</HI> from
the Equinoctial; an&s;wering to the <HI>Sun</HI>'s greate&s;t Declination, 23
Degrees, 28 Minutes; being the true Declination of the Sun in this (our
Author's) Age, which Table is more copiou&s;ly u&s;eful than <HI>Orontius,</HI>
or Doctor <HI>Re|cord</HI>'s Table, and yet not &s;o prolix as <HI>Era&s;mus
Reignholt</HI>'s. Next we have the <HI>Poles</HI> of the <HI>Zodiac</HI>
explain'd, what the <HI>Summer Tropic,</HI> and what the <HI>Winter</HI> is.
Whence the four <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> of the Year are derived, what the two
<HI>Colures</HI> are, the <HI>Artick</HI> Circle, and the <HI>Antartick</HI>
defin'd, from <HI>Proclus,</HI> as mo&s;t of the other Di&s;tinctions are. Thus
PHILONICUS having learn'd his Scholar what the <HI>&s;ix</HI> greater Circles
of the Sphere are, and what the <HI>four</HI> le&s;&s;er, gives him the
rea&s;on why they are &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd from <HI>John de
Sacro-Bo&s;co.</HI> Then repre&s;enting the&s;e &s;everal Parts together in one
Figure or Picture, he concludes his Account of the <HI>Cele&s;tial</HI> Sphere,
and &s;o proceeds to that which comprehends the <HI>Elementary</HI> Region,
ob&s;erving why it can con&s;i&s;t but of four Elements; their Order and
Situation, the Divi&s;ion of the Air, where Comets, Hail and Snow are
engendred, what the Earth is, Diver&s;ity of Opinions touching its Form,
Objections again&s;t its Rotundity an&s;wer'd from <HI>Cleomedes,</HI> al&s;o
from the Ex|ample of two Eclip&s;es of the Moon, and Ob&s;ervation of &s;ome
Stars, with Reference for further Proof to <HI>Ptolemy, Philo, Ari&s;totle,
Reignholt, Orontius, John de Sacro-Bo&s;co,</HI> and Ma&s;ter <HI>Recorde</HI>;
who does almo&s;t repeat all their Argu|ments, in his <HI>Ca&s;tle of
Knowledge.</HI> Here, joining together all the Parts which have been
&s;everally before treated of, in one Type or Figure of a compleat Sphere,
repre&s;enting both the Heavens and the Earth, he concludes with making his
Scholar give him a Recapitulation of what he had learnt in this fir&s;t Book;
&s;o proceeds to</P>
<P>The &s;econd Book, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in which is plainly
expre&s;&s;ed the Order and Number of Zones, Parallels and Climates; al&s;o
&s;undry ways for the exact finding out of the Meridian Line, the Longitude and
Latitude of Places, with many other Pre|cepts belonging to the making of a
Carte or Mappe. After an ingenious Introduction of this Book, and Repetition of
what is taught in it, the Author, &s;eeing the Matter thereof chiefly de|pends
upon Dimen&s;ion and Men&s;uration, fir&s;t &s;hews what <HI>Di|men&s;ion</HI>
is; what a Point, what a Line, what a Platform, and what a Body is. Then gives
us a Table of <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI>; the quantity of <HI>Helvetian</HI> and of
<HI>Engli&s;h Miles</HI>; the different Signification of <HI>Longitude,</HI>
both in A&s;tronomy and Co&s;mo|graphy; <PB N="30" REF="53"> what
<HI>Latitude</HI> is; how to find out the <HI>Circuit</HI> of the Earth and the
Vertical Point, with the Diver&s;ity of O|pinions about the Circuit of the
Earth: Then, of what Parts are habitable, and what not. Of the Zones, and the
Error of <HI>Polybius</HI>; the Objection of &s;ome being uninhabitable

North, and the <HI>Antipodes,</HI> who have theirs to the South; la&s;tly, the
<HI>Peri&s;cii,</HI> who have their Shadow going about the Horizon. Here
follows a <HI>Table of Shadows,</HI> &s;hewing their Proportion to the
<HI>Gnomon</HI> (it being divided into 60 parts) for every Degree of the Sun's
Altitude; and al&s;o the quantity of the Shadow in every Country, Region and
City, thro' the univer&s;al Earth, when the Sun is in the Equinoxial and
Sol&s;ticial Points. Then returning to the <HI>Zones,</HI> he &s;hews how they
differ from <HI>Cli|mates,</HI> with <HI>Ptolemy</HI>'s Divi&s;ion of Climates;
next, what <HI>Parallels</HI> are, exemplified in a Figure. The number of
Cli|mates, al&s;o in a Figure; and Quantity both of them and Pa|rallels; with a
<HI>Table containing the number of Parallels and Climates,</HI> with the
Elevation of the <HI>Pole-Artic,</HI> and <HI>Quantity</HI> of the longe&s;t
Day and Night an&s;wering hereto. Of South Parallels, and the Rea&s;on why
<HI>Avicenne</HI> thought the Air mo&s;t temperate under the Equinoxial; which
introduces a Conjecture where <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> was &s;eated, and
<HI>Lyra</HI>'s Interpre|tation that the <HI>Fiery Sword</HI> was the
<HI>burning Zone,</HI> with a Con|jecture where <HI>Hell</HI> is &s;eated.
After which, we have <HI>Gla|rian</HI>'s Manner of finding out the Noon-Stead
or Meridian Line, and four other Methods al&s;o of finding the &s;ame. The
Order of finding the Height of any Planet or fix'd Star in the Noon&s;tead Line
by Night. Then follows <HI>a Table of the Sun's Meridian Altitude above the
Horizon,</HI> calculated for every Degree in the Zodiac, re&s;pecting the
Elevation of the Pole-Artic, at <HI>Norwich</HI> 52 Degrees 10 Min. and the
Sun's Declination 23 Deg. 28 Min. The manner to find out the Elevation of the
Pole above the Horizon, and the <HI>Lati|tude</HI> of any Region, City or Town,

every Place as well by Day as Night, and at every Hour, by means of a little
<HI>Clock,</HI> &s;uch as they u&s;ed to wear in the fa&s;hion of a Tablet;
whereof were then made as excellent without <HI>Temple-Bar</HI> as any which

ends this &s;econd Book.</P>
<P>In the <HI>third Book</HI> is expre&s;s'd the making and
Portraiture of the Face of the Earth, both in <HI>Cartes</HI> particular, and
al&s;o u|niver&s;al: with divers Things incident thereto. Here having &s;hewn
what a chief Requi&s;ite the Art of Drawing or Delineat|ing is in the Study of
Co&s;mography, and what noble Rewards the Ancients had in &s;tore for the
Inventors of Science; when they not only gave them abundance of Trea&s;ure, but
al&s;o deified them for the &s;ame: The Author de&s;cends to explain what an
<HI>I&s;land</HI> is; what a <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI>; an <HI>I&s;thmus</HI>; a
<HI>Conti|nent</HI>; then exhibits them all in a Map together; with an An&s;wer
to an Objection again&s;t the Form of the Terre&s;trial Globe; &s;o begins with
teaching the Manner of making a particular Carte for any Region, and here draws
up a Ta|ble of the <HI>Quantity</HI> and <HI>Proportion</HI> of the
<HI>Equinoxial,</HI> or any great Circle, to every Parallel, North and South
therefrom. Hence we are led to a particular Example, containing the whole
Proce&s;s in making a <HI>Map of England,</HI> and &s;hewing how the Work
chiefly depends on the Meridian Line, ap|pointing thereby the Longitudes; and
by Parallels of Cli|mates, who&s;e u&s;e in a Carte is to limit the Latitude
from the Equinoxial: This is illu&s;trated by a Draught or Figure. From hence
we are taught how to de&s;cribe three or four Regions in one Map, or as many as
are contained in one eighth Part of the Earth; and after the particular
In&s;truc|tions for this Operation, we have the Form al&s;o thereof de|lineated
to the Eye. So we proceed to the Compo&s;ition of a Map for one half of the
Earth, whereof al&s;o we have a <PB N="32" REF="55"> Draught. And this is
followed by the Method of making a Map for the whole Earth, which we are again
further ac|quainted with by lineal Repre&s;entations: And here we have a
<HI>Table</HI> of the <HI>Segments</HI> and Parts of the Equinoxial, drawn in a
plain Platform, an&s;wering to the Circumference of Parallels. A little further
is another <HI>Table of Regions</HI> and <HI>Cities</HI> &s;ubject to the
<HI>Signs</HI> and <HI>Planets.</HI> Then we have the Figure of an
<HI>In&s;trument,</HI> &s;erving to make a Map, without knowing Longitude or
Latitude, which is here called a <HI>Geo|graphical Plain Sphere,</HI> by which
not only the Di&s;tance of one Place from another may be found in the Map, but
of the Places them&s;elves, in Miles al&s;o from one another; as by a
Demon&s;tration here figured out appears: And with this Experiment ends the
third Book.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fourth Book</HI> lays down &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary Principles
and Rules as are to be ob&s;erved in <HI>Hydrography,</HI> and
<HI>Navigation.</HI> Herein it is propo&s;ed not to &s;hew the minute
Difference of one Ve&s;&s;el from another, nor their Names, nor their Burden,
but how to correct the Errors in guiding and directing them. And fir&s;t, we
have a Divi&s;ion of the Waters, from the gene|ral Name of the Ocean, down to
Lakes and Ponds. The Cau&s;e of Spring and Ebb <HI>Tides.</HI> Cau&s;e of
<HI>Ebbing</HI> and <HI>Flow|ing.</HI> How to find the <HI>Age</HI> of the
<HI>Moon</HI> at all times. The <HI>Epact,</HI> with a <HI>Table</HI> to find
it. A <HI>Table</HI> of the <HI>Sun's ri&s;ing</HI> and <HI>going down</HI>
throughout the Year; whereby to find how long the Moon &s;hines every Night. A
<HI>Table</HI> &s;hewing how long the <HI>Moon &s;hines</HI> in our
<HI>Horizon. Another</HI> &s;hewing in what Places, chiefly on the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Shore, the Moon makes full Seas. How to know the exact
<HI>Time</HI> of <HI>Ebbing</HI> and <HI>Flow|ing,</HI> with a <HI>Table</HI>
for finding out <HI>Ebbs</HI> and <HI>Floods</HI> in the Coa&s;ts of
<HI>England, Scotland, Ireland, Dutchland,</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> A
De&s;cription of the <HI>Wind.</HI> The Number, Divi&s;ion, and Nature of the
Winds. The new Divi&s;ion of the Horizon into 32 Parts, by the learned
Hydrographers, &s;eemingly in our Author's Time; who here di&s;po&s;es them
into a <HI>Type</HI> or <HI>Figure.</HI> Of the Mariners <HI>Compa&s;s,</HI>
unknown to the Ancients, found out by <HI>Gemma,</HI> and a Draught of it. The
Prai&s;e of the <HI>Needle</HI>; the Ob&s;ervations of <HI>Jofrancus</HI> in
what Places it has erred. How to correct the Needle in Day-time, by help of the

With the&s;e Di&s;coveries and Directions in Co&s;mography, Geography, and
Navigation, our Author ends this fourth Book.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fifth Book</HI> de&s;cribes the Parts of the Earth,
particu|larly according to late Ob&s;ervations; with the <HI>Longitudes</HI>
and <HI>Latitudes</HI> of Regions, Provinces, I&s;lands, Cities, Towns,
Villages, and Hills: Al&s;o the Commodities, Natures, Laws, Rights, and
Cu&s;toms of many Countries, and their Inhabi|tants. This begins with a
particular De&s;cription of <HI>Europe,</HI> containing <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI>
and part of <HI>Turky</HI>; beginning with <HI>Ireland,</HI> as
<HI>Ptolemy</HI> does: In which, after a &s;hort Account of the Products and
Character of the People, and Dimen|&s;ions of the I&s;land, he notes the chief
Places, with their Longitude and Latitude: So proceeds to <HI>England,</HI>
which is treated of in the &s;ame manner. Then <HI>Scotland, Iceland,
Cor&s;ica, Sicily, Sardinia, Majorca</HI> and <HI>Minorca, Gades, Eu|boea,

135.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS Tract was the Product chiefly of that ten Years Ob&s;ervation
and Experience which our Author had in <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> as he
informs us in his Dedication to the Gentry thereof, among whom he was fir&s;t
introduced by his honoured Friend, Sir <HI>William Tate,</HI> as therein al&s;o
ap|pears. Not but the &s;aid Frauds and Corruptions in Phy&s;ick were
epidemical enough to have mov'd him to the like Ani|madver&s;ions, had he
re&s;ided in any other part of the Nation. For as he &s;ays, in his
<HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> to the <HI>Reader</HI>; 
<Q REND="inline">"So infinitely do the numbers of barbarous and
unlearned <HI>Coun&s;ellors of Health</HI> at this time over&s;pread all
Corners of this Kingdom, that their confu&s;ed Swarms do not only every where
cover and eclip&s;e the Sun-&s;hine of all true Learning and Under|&s;tanding,
but generally darken and extingui&s;h the very Light of common Sen&s;e and
Rea&s;on."</Q> Therefore, both in duty to the common Good, and to the
Sollicitations of his Friends, he pre&s;ents us with 
<Q REND="inline">"this needful Detection of harmful Succours, and
nece&s;&s;ary Council for &s;afe Supply."</Q> He propo&s;es to &s;uit the
meane&s;t Readers with the Plainne&s;s and Simplicity of a familiar Stile; and
to keep the Current of the Text clear from all Quotation of ancient
<HI>Languages,</HI> referring only the learned to the Margin; which latter, he
has ob&s;erved through every Page. His Method further, is to illu&s;trate his
general Cautions and Rules with particular Ca&s;es and Reports, drawn chiefly
from tho&s;e Parts where he now practi&s;ed and re&s;ided, as an Inducement to
read, and an Enticement to continue, Example being neither lea&s;t plea&s;ing
nor lea&s;t profitable to the Vulgar.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="58">The Work it&s;elf is open'd with an
<HI>Introduction,</HI> &s;hewing, how de&s;irable, but how difficult it is, to
meet with an able Phy&s;ician, thro' the variety of Cau&s;es and
Circum&s;tances to be con&s;ider'd in Di&s;ea&s;es, and the Application of
Remedies; with the ill Con&s;equences of the common Neglect and Igno|rance
herein, and the monopolizing of Cures to the Pre|rogative of this or that
Secret, to the Contempt of the due Permutation of Medicines and the Increa&s;e
of Di&s;ea&s;es, both beyond their own Nature, and the Con&s;titutions of the
Sick. Here, among tho&s;e Things, the indi&s;criminate u&s;e of which he
di&s;commends, are mention'd Tobacco, and Quick&s;ilver, and even Ca&s;&s;ia,
and Rhubarb, which being indi&s;creetly, out of time and place di&s;penced,
bring Mi&s;chief in&s;tead of Good; with other In&s;tances here produced, both
of internal and external Remedies, mo&s;t &s;overeign and renowned in
them&s;elves, which yet do bring forth effects unworthy of them&s;elves, and
all becau&s;e &s;uch a promi&s;cuous and unskilful Rabble of the meane&s;t
Mechanicks, Women, Prie&s;ts, Witches, Conjurers, Jugglers, and
Fortune-Tellers, are &s;uffer'd to become Medicine-Mongers, and make a gainful
Traffic of Homicide it &s;elf. That not only the Simple but tho&s;e al&s;o of
better Sort are deluded to encourage &s;uch Preten|ders, on account of &s;ome
ca&s;ual Succe&s;s; but, &s;ays our Author, 
<Q REND="inline">"As in Military De&s;igns, oft-times a bold and
fool-hardy Enterprize, above and be&s;ide Rea&s;on, and beyond Ex|pectation,
produceth an excellent and admir'd Good in the happy I&s;&s;ue; yet it is not
commended, or in any ca&s;e permitted, as being very dangerous in ordinary
Practice, or Cu&s;tom of Warfare: &s;o likewi&s;e, divers Events of Me|dicines
prove good, who&s;e bold U&s;e and ra&s;h Pre&s;cription is dangerous and
unskilful"</Q> He concludes this Chapter with ob&s;erving, That as improper
Remedies are, for the mo&s;t part, wor&s;e than Di&s;ea&s;es, and unlearned
Phy&s;icians, of all bad Cau&s;es of Di&s;ea&s;es, are them&s;elves the

know the Good from Ill and Ill from Good; beginning with the la&s;t fir&s;t,
in</P>
<P>Chap. 2. <HI>Of the Emperick.</HI> Herein is de&s;cribed, what an
Emperick is; in what his Defects con&s;i&s;t. The A&s;&s;i&s;tance of
Invention; of Experience, and what a circum&s;cribed Guide of it &s;elf. 
<Q REND="inline">"For as it is with the Soldier in the Field, let
his own &s;pecial Experience in Arms be never &s;o an|cient, &s;o true, &s;o
&s;ound, yet without a more general Un|der&s;tanding or Theory, and a more
enlarged Knowledge than his particular and limited Experience can bring forth, 
<PB N="36" REF="59"> he mu&s;t be lamely fitted to many &s;udden and oft before
unfore&s;een Occurrents, which the perpetual Mutability and Change of
Circum&s;tances in Warfare mu&s;t needs produce. The Field, the Enemy, the Time
(not always the &s;ame) require a divers and oft a contrary Con&s;ultation,
De&s;ign, and Manner, wherein one particular Experience by it &s;elf, cannot
but be much wanting, becau&s;e the &s;ame Thing or Action &s;eldom or never
happens again the &s;ame in all Circum&s;tances; and one Circum&s;tance alone
com|monly altering the whole Condition. As it is in Military Affairs, &s;o is
it in the A&s;&s;aults of Di&s;ea&s;es, where the Fight and Wre&s;tling of
Nature is not always in the &s;ame Part, nor in the &s;ame Form or Manner, nor
with the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e, nor of the &s;ame Period: All which
Circum|&s;tances in the &s;ame Subject cannot happen always to any Sight or
Sen&s;e the &s;ame, which makes Experience; yet are ever pre&s;ent in the
general Notions of the Under|&s;tanding, whereby the prudent and wi&s;e Man
doth make &s;upply, tho' Experience fail."</Q> Be&s;ides, many Di&s;ea&s;es
a|ri&s;e in the Body of Man which are &s;carce &s;een in a Man's Life, and in
which, Experience can give no Pre&s;cription. Here are mentioned, the
<HI>French</HI> Di&s;ea&s;e and the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> &s;trange to us once, and
the <HI>Engli&s;h Sweating-Sickne&s;s,</HI> &s;o now. To the&s;e are added,
&s;ome more &s;ingular and un|common Accidents, as <HI>Rulandus</HI> his Report
of the Golden Tooth which grew naturally in the Mouth of a Child. Al&s;o
another Child, in <HI>Hollerus,</HI> who thru&s;t its hand out of its Mother's
Navel for 15 Days, and was afterwards born alive, and the Mother &s;afe.
Al&s;o, <HI>Bra&s;avola</HI>'s Cure of the Soldier who had almo&s;t half his
Head cut away with part of his Brains. Hence he de&s;cends to &s;everal
Examples and Ca&s;es of his own Ob&s;ervation in <HI>Northampton&s;hire</HI>;
and con|cludes, from them, that every Day almo&s;t, may po&s;e bare and naked
Experience, e&s;pecially when Empericks apply it to &s;imilar Appearances: 
<Q REND="inline">"For, with the Wi&s;e, the <HI>like,</HI> is much
unlike the <HI>&s;ame</HI>; and it is a chief Point in all Learning, truly to
di&s;cern between differing Similitudes and like Differences. Many Accidents
fall out &s;eeming alike, yet have no Affinity; and again, in Shew the &s;ame,
yet indeed, contrary. Contraries have oft, in many things, Likene&s;s; and
Likene&s;s, Contraries, ea&s;ily deceiving the Unwotting and Unlearned."</Q>
This again is proved by many In&s;tances, tending to demon&s;trate the
Imperfections of their Practice, who u&s;e no light of Judgment or Rea&s;on, 
<PB N="37" REF="60"> but the only Sen&s;e of their own Experience. With regard
al&s;o to whom, our Author &s;ays a little further, 
<Q REND="inline">"I wou'd it were a Slander, in the&s;e days, that
Good-Will and excel|lent Medicines, put to death more Lives than open Mur|der;"
and thinks "it would be happy, if at length, the common Inconvenience and
publick Scandal might be|get a Law, and Law bring forth Re&s;traint."</Q> Here
al&s;o we have many In&s;tances how helple&s;s or hurtful good Medi|cines are,
when apply'd without Di&s;tinction of proper Cir|cum&s;tances, Concomitancies,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> intended to caution us again&s;t putting any confidence in the
Excellency of any Re|medies, without Advice for the right Di&s;pen&s;ation of
them, and con&s;equently, again&s;t relying upon the many Books of
<HI>Phy&s;ical Receipts</HI> and Apothecaries Shops in print, which were then
divulged in all Places; wi&s;e and di&s;creet Men knowing, that Things without
Rea&s;on in them&s;elves, are by Rea&s;on and Wi&s;dom to be guided.</P>
<P>Chap. 3. is <HI>Of the Practice of</HI> Women <HI>about the Sick;

vulgar Pretenders were before exclaimed a|gain&s;t, for want of proper
Education and Knowledge, Pa|tients are, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, warned
again&s;t con&s;ulting with <HI>Petticoat Practitioners</HI>; who are rather
advi&s;ed to pre|&s;cribe Rules of <HI>Conduct</HI> to them&s;elves, than
<HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> to their Friends; as what would free them from the
Unhappine&s;s of having their Hands &s;o commonly in others Mi&s;haps, to the
Di&s;honour of their own Sex; by intimidating the Sick with Doubts, and
di&s;&s;uading them, if not from Phy&s;ick ab|&s;olutely, yet from the regular
Compo&s;ition and U&s;e of it; from all that is not of their own making, or of
which they have not had Tryal; as their own Ointments, Plai&s;ters,
Cear-Cloths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> often beguiling them with the dangerous Flattery
of harmle&s;s and palatable Medicines, proving, that old <HI>Eve</HI> will

incredible that &s;uch mean &s;ort of People can get acquaintance with &s;uch

<P>Chap. 5. is, <HI>Of Surgeons</HI>; and &s;uch as e&s;teeming well
of them&s;elves for the Exerci&s;e of their Hands in Wounds, Am|putations,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> arrogate a Privilege in the Practice of Phy|&s;ick; and even
undertake to educate and in&s;titute Phy&s;icians, as an Undergrowth to
them&s;elves; and that thus al&s;o the World is furni&s;hed with Factors for
the Grave. Hereof he produces Examples, manife&s;ting, by the Practice of
the&s;e Barber-Surgeons, how confident Ignorance will be, and how powerfully it
will infatuate the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. And here again is arraign'd, the Cu&s;tom
of giving the &s;ame Medicine to different Con&s;titutions. Whence, &s;ays our
Author, 
<Q REND="inline">"How can he who con&s;iders the Di&s;ea&s;e and
not the Per|&s;on, in curing the one, but in danger the other?"</Q> A little
farther he lays down the plain and uncontrolled Difference between the Learned
and the Unlearned in the Faculty; and &s;hews how the Learned has a Prerogative
in three Parts to him&s;elf, and an equal Part with the Unlearned, in the
fourth; yet allows, that in many de&s;perate Ca&s;es, the Igno|rant by their
Blindne&s;s, their Boldne&s;s, and their Luck, may be the only fit
In&s;truments. Here we have al&s;o Examples how wonderous Good oft i&s;&s;ues
out of devili&s;h and dange|rous Acts; yet if the Unskilful fail, the hopeful
U&s;e of any <PB N="39" REF="62"> other Means is commonly thereby over-run, and
the Hap|pine&s;s of After-health by better Council, fru&s;trated. Hence we are
led to</P>
<P>Chap. 6. Of <HI>Apothecaries:</HI> To whom thus much is al|low'd;
That if any may have Prerogative to be Phy&s;icians by the Excellence and rare
Choice of Medicines, it is mo&s;t proper unto them. Nay, 'tis further allow'd,
that for the excellent Preparation and Knowledge of Medicines, they &s;ometimes
may excel &s;ome Phy&s;icians them&s;elves. 
<Q REND="inline">"But above and beyond the Preparation; the right
and judicious Di&s;pen&s;ation is truly worthy, commanding and directing
therein &s;afe and prudent U&s;e. This Skill requires an Un|der&s;tanding able
to rai&s;e it&s;elf above both the Medicine and the Maker, unto the Great Maker
of them both, and from his general Decree and Council in the Admini&s;|tration
of all things in Nature, to levy and limit Circum|&s;tances, Proportion, Time,
Place, Quantity, and Qua|lity, according to the manifold Purpo&s;es and
infinite U&s;es for the Pre&s;ervation, Con&s;ervation, and Conti|nuance of
Health and Life to Mankind."</Q> So far as the Apothecaries keep within their
own proper Bounds, they cannot be denied a worthy E&s;teem; but if the Pride
and Ma&s;ter&s;hip of the Medicine &s;tir once in them the Ambition of
Medication, they will be ju&s;tly condemned. A little further the Que&s;tion is
propo&s;ed, whether a Phy&s;ician &s;hould be both Surgeon and Apothecary
him&s;elf. And it is allow'd that in Judgment, Skill, Knowledge, and Ability of
Direc|tion, it may be requi&s;ite; but the particular Execution &s;hould be
divided to others, who&s;e continual Exerci&s;e therein makes them fitter for
it; and this Chapter is concluded with &s;ome further Remarks to the &s;ame
Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Chap. 7. <HI>Of Practi&s;ers by Spells.</HI> Among the Arguments
here u&s;ed again&s;t the&s;e Deluders, is this, 
<Q REND="inline">"If the faithful and devout Prayer of Holy Men, to
which the Promi&s;e of God and Ble&s;&s;ings of Men are annexed, has no &s;uch
A&s;|&s;urance or Succe&s;s of nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equent, without la|borious
Indu&s;try and the u&s;e of good Means, how can Religion or Rea&s;on &s;uffer
Men who are not void of both to give &s;uch impious Credit unto an
in&s;ignificant and &s;en&s;ele&s;s Mumbling of idle Words, contrary to
Rea&s;on, without Precedent of any truly wi&s;e or learned, and ju&s;tly
&s;u&s;pected of all &s;en&s;ibe Men?"</Q></P>
<P>Chap. 8. <HI>Of Witchcraft in the Sick,</HI> &amp;c. Herein are
va|rious Arguments advanced, to prove there are many things <PB N="40" REF="63"> whereof few Men, many whereof no Man can attain the Rea&s;on, yet
every Man knoweth to have a Rea&s;on in Nature. That Ca&s;ualty oft apts
Con&s;equences to Dreams, yet it is no Proof of Truth to tru&s;t in them. That
Women in their Sleep have fore&s;een or foretold many Things which have come to
pa&s;s, but this makes their Dreams no Oracles; and many vain Men have
confidently predicted &s;uch Things as have happen'd, yet are not taken for
Prophets. In like man|ner, &s;ome who have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves with
Witchcraft and the Opinion thereof, have &s;eemed to know Things a|bove their
Knowledge, and That Knowledge above and beyond all Rea&s;on hath been true. Yet
neither is this any Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them&s;elves of this Spirit of
Folly, nor ju&s;t Proof or Accu&s;ation of any one to be a Witch. Our Author
does not deny or defend devili&s;h Practices of Men and Women, but de&s;ires
only 
<Q REND="inline">"to moderate the general Madne&s;s of this Age,
which a&s;cribes to Witchcraft what|&s;oever falls out unknown or &s;trange to
a vulgar Sen&s;e."</Q> Therefore, concerning Di&s;ea&s;es, there are here &s;et
forth &s;ome &s;trange and particular Ca&s;es, which had undergone unju&s;t
Imputations of this kind; and one e&s;pecially, of a Gentlewoman, whom certain
Witches, lately executed for Sorcery, confe&s;s'd to have bewitch'd; tho' her
Malady was only a natural Complication of divers Di&s;orders, chiefly
convul&s;ive, which produced a Concour&s;e of Accidents, &s;eeming of
mon&s;trous and wondered Shapes. Upon this, &s;ays our Author, I grant the
voluntary and uncompelled, or duly and truly evicted Confe&s;&s;ion of a
<HI>Witch,</HI> to be &s;ufficient Condemnation of her&s;elf, and therefore,
ju&s;tly hath the Law laid their Blood upon their own Heads; but their
Confe&s;&s;ion, I cannot conceive &s;ufficient Eviction of the
<HI>Witchcraft</HI> it&s;elf; and this Topic is conluded with Arguments and
Cautions further to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Chap. 9. <HI>Of Wi&s;ards.</HI> The&s;e are de&s;cribed to be a
&s;ort of Practitioners, whom our Cu&s;tom and Country call Wi&s;e Men, and
Wi&s;e Women, reputed a kind of hone&s;t harmle&s;s Witches or Wi&s;ards, who,
by good Words, hallowed Herbs, Salves, and other &s;uper&s;titious Ceremonies,
promi&s;e to allay and calm De|vils, Practices of other Witches, and the Force
of many Di&s;|ea&s;es. But the&s;e being much of the &s;ame Nature with tho&s;e
before mentioned to u&s;e Spells, are referred unto them, and di&s;mi&s;s'd
with a &s;hort Hi&s;tory of our Author's Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Chap. 10. <HI>Of Servants to Phy&s;icians and mini&s;tring
Help|ers.</HI> Our Author concludes his Number and Di&s;tinction 
<PB N="41" REF="64"> of <HI>Empericks</HI> with this Tribe; who are &s;uch as
either by oft &s;erving Phy&s;icians, or conver&s;ing with them and viewing
their Practice, or by Employment from their Directions, or by Attendance about
the Sick, engro&s;s to them&s;elves &s;up|po&s;ed &s;pecial Ob&s;ervations and
choice Remedies; and with &s;uch &s;mall Ware, taken upon credit, &s;et up for
them&s;elves. Here the In&s;ufficiency of &s;uch api&s;h Imitation is
de&s;canted upon, and this kind of &s;econd-hand U&s;e of other People's
Practice; &s;hewing, in &s;everal Aphori&s;tical Ob&s;ervations how un&s;afe
&s;uch Experience in Phy&s;ick is; as 
<Q REND="inline">"how nece&s;&s;ary it is, That Man &s;hould be in
him&s;elf a Ma&s;ter of Know|ledge and &s;incere Judgment, who &s;hall be able
truely to make right U&s;e of another's Experience."</Q> And even 
<Q REND="inline">"That which Experience has once, or oft times
known and found to do good, mu&s;t not therefore, in nece&s;&s;ity, &s;till do
the &s;ame good, except the &s;ame Rea&s;on of the good, do, in each
Circum&s;tance, again commend and command it; which only they can judge and
examine who are wi&s;e and learned."</Q> With other like Reflections therefore
on this prepo&s;terous Practice; and a Detail of &s;uch Abilities and
Application as are requi&s;ite for attaining a &s;uf|ficiency in this
Profe&s;&s;ion, our Author concludes this Chap|ter, and therewith the

was, &s;ays he, an able Philo&s;opher, a curious Cri|tic, and well vers'd in

the Pre&s;s, yet are tho&s;e Imperfections of little moment, becau&s;e the Work
is conci&s;e.</P>
<P>The Book it&s;elf is divided into twelve Chapters, in the
following Order.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Of the Invention of Dials, Clocks, Watches, and other
Time-Tellers.</HI> Here, &s;peaking of the Divi&s;ion of Time, he tells you,
whence the Name of <HI>Horae</HI> or Hours, was derived according to
<HI>Macrobius,</HI> and how the Day was divided into twenty-four Hours
according to the <HI>Egyptians</HI>; of the <HI>Clyp|&s;idrae</HI> or
Water-gla&s;&s;es; of the Way to make the Motion of Time vi&s;ible and audible,
fir&s;t by the Invention of <HI>Sun-Dials</HI>; with an Ob&s;ervation from
<HI>Busbequius,</HI> that the <HI>Turks</HI> <PB N="43" REF="66"> have no
Di&s;tinction of Miles or Hours; and that among the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> their
Bellies were their Dials; upon what Defects the Invention of Engines by the
<HI>Trochilic</HI> Art, or that of Wheels aro&s;e, and that <HI>Severinus
Boetius</HI> was the fir&s;t who contrived any Engine of this &s;ort. Then as
to their Va|riety; &s;ome being mute, &s;ome vocal, &s;ome &s;o &s;mall as to
be worn in Rings, for making whereof, in <HI>Italy,</HI> our Coun|tryman
<HI>George Whitehead</HI> is celebrated by <HI>Schottus</HI> in his Itinerary.
Then of <HI>Andrew Alciat</HI>'s Clock, which was both Larum and Tinder-Box. Of
A&s;tronomical Clocks; that at <HI>Prague,</HI> &s;erving al&s;o as an Almanac:
That at <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> more particularly de&s;crib'd in <HI>Coriat</HI>'s
Travels. The &s;trange alphabetical Globe of our Countryman <HI>Linne,</HI> a
Je&s;uit of <HI>Liege,</HI> which in a Water-gla&s;s would turn to an Index
every Hour, according to the Accounts of <HI>Kercher, de magnete,</HI> and
<HI>Ga&s;&s;endus</HI> in the Life of <HI>Peiri&s;cus.</HI> The no le&s;s
&s;trange Cork of the &s;aid <HI>Kercher,</HI> which, with Seeds of the
Helio|trope in it, would al&s;o in Water keep Cour&s;e with the Sun. He gives
us one more De&s;cription of a Saddle-Clock, at <HI>Dre&s;den,</HI> from
<HI>Mory&s;in</HI>'s Travels: So concludes this Head with a <HI>Latin</HI>
Epigram, by <HI>Tho. Campian,</HI> on a Watch, with the Tran&s;lation by
<HI>H.V.</HI> i. e. <HI>Vaughan.</HI> And an Ob&s;ervation from <HI>Tycho
Brahe</HI> on a Defect in all Clocks and Watches; in Watches, for that the
fir&s;t half Hour goes fa&s;ter than the la&s;t, becau&s;e Springs, wound up,
move fa&s;ter in the begin|ning; and in Clocks, the la&s;t half Hour is
fa&s;ter than the fir&s;t, becau&s;e their Weights move flower at fir&s;t, and
ac|celerate as they draw nearer the Earth.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Of &s;ome curious Spheres, and Repre&s;entations of
the World.</HI> This Chapter is introduced with a Prai&s;e of
<HI>Ar|chimedes,</HI> and <HI>Claudian</HI>'s Epigram on his Coele&s;tial
Sphere, with a Tran&s;lation of it by Mr. <HI>Nath. Carpenter.</HI> Of King
<HI>Sapor's</HI> Gla&s;s-Sphere. The Emperor <HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s &s;ilver
Heaven, which he pre&s;ented to <HI>Solyman,</HI> as mention'd by <HI>Paul
Jovius Sabellicus,</HI> and <HI>Dubartas.</HI> Among the Moderns, <HI>Cornelius
Van Drebble</HI> of <HI>Alcmar,</HI> is much admir'd: He liv'd in
<HI>England,</HI> had a gold Chain &s;ent him by the Emperor, and was <HI>Regi
Jacobo &agrave; Mechanicis,</HI> King <HI>James</HI> his Engi|neer: He
pre&s;ented that King with a <HI>Perpetual Motion,</HI> which is here
de&s;crib'd; and a Draught or Figure of it, re|ferr'd to in Mr. <HI>Tho.
Tims</HI>'s <HI>Philo&s;ophical Dialogue.</HI> He is prai&s;ed by <HI>Marcellus
Vrankheim,</HI> in an Epi&s;tle, and his &s;aid Microco&s;m by
<HI>Grotius,</HI> in a <HI>Latin</HI> Epigram, which you have here recited with

with which he u&s;ed to recreate the Em|peror <HI>Charles</HI> V. as his brazen

<HI>Strada</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Low-Country</HI> Wars.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Of &s;undry Machines, and artificial Motions by
Water and Air.</HI> In this, having admir'd the wonderful Creation of the
greater World and the le&s;&s;er, and in&s;tanced how many u&s;eful Machines
and artificial Motions have been framed after tho&s;e two primary
<HI>Automata</HI> that God him|&s;elf made, he enumerates &s;everal Engineers,
ancient and modern, who have been famous for &s;uch Works; then pro|ceeds to
treat, fir&s;t, of <HI>Wind-Motions,</HI> whereof, after men|tioning what
<HI>Bapti&s;ta Porta</HI> and <HI>Marinus Mer&s;ennus</HI> had written upon
this Subject, he gives Examples in the wooden Dove of <HI>Architas,</HI> the
wooden Eagle of <HI>Regiomontanus,</HI> and his Iron Fly, the &s;ailing Chariot
of <HI>Simon Stevinius,</HI> which would carry eight or nine Per&s;ons above
forty Miles in two Hours. 'Twas in the fa&s;hion of a Boat, with four Wheels
and two Sails. It was much admir'd by <HI>Peireskius</HI> accord|ing to
<HI>Ga&s;&s;endus</HI>; and here are two Epigrams of <HI>Grotius</HI> upon it,
with their Tran&s;lations. Then we have Accounts of Statues, walking and
&s;peaking, and the artificial Animals which <HI>Luitprandus</HI> &s;aw at
<HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI>; the Statue of <HI>Al|bert Magnus,</HI> Friar
<HI>Bacon</HI>'s brazen Head, and the vocal I|mage in King <HI>Richard</HI> the

Boards without Hands, at <HI>Dantzick</HI>; and &s;uch another, which Dr.
<HI>John Dee</HI> &s;aw at <HI>Prague,</HI> as he mentions him&s;elf. Then he
&s;peaks of the <HI>Wind-Guns, Aeolii Scopoli,</HI> to di&s;charge without
Powder, and <HI>Aeoliae Pilae</HI> or <HI>Wind-Balls,</HI> to blow up or kindle
Fires; and <HI>Wind-Spits,</HI> according to the Ac|count of <HI>Cardan.</HI>
Then he comes to <HI>Water-Motions,</HI> and here mentions the curious Mills at
<HI>Thoulou&s;e</HI> and <HI>Dantzick,</HI> from the Accounts of
<HI>Golnitz</HI> and <HI>Mori&s;on</HI>; al&s;o the Mint at <HI>Segovia,</HI>

<HI>France</HI> for the Interview between <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and
<HI>Francis</HI> I. which &s;o many Writers have &s;poken of (tho' we think not
that it is here placed under its proper Head) and la&s;tly a more di&s;tinct
Account of <HI>Mem|non</HI>'s Statue, its mu&s;ical Property, even when it was

<P N="4">IV. <HI>Of the Art and My&s;tery of Writing, with the
In&s;truments.</HI></P>
<P>This he begins with &s;hewing what a va&s;t number of dif|ferent
ways the Alphabet may be joined according to <HI>Clavius.</HI> That the
<HI>Chine&s;e</HI> have 40000 Letters according to <HI>Purchas,</HI> and that
the <HI>Indians</HI> admir'd this dumb Commerce, &s;o as to believe that
Letters were Spirits, or a kind of <HI>Internuncii</HI> between the

<P N="7">VII. <HI>Of the Art of Spinning and Weaving, with the
&s;eve|ral Materials of Garments.</HI> After a Word or two on the In|vention of
this Art a&s;cribed to <HI>Minerva,</HI> we are inform'd of a rare
&s;elf-moving Engine at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> which would weave four or five Webs
at a time, and without human help work night and day; which, yet in favour of
the poor Weavers, was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the Inventor &s;ecretly
de&s;troy'd, according to <HI>Lancelotti.</HI> He next &s;peaks of the
primitive Attire of Fig-leaves, and <HI>Paul</HI> the Hermit's Suit of
Palm-leaves; the Skins of Bea&s;ts; <HI>Arachne's</HI> Excellence in Spin|ning;
the &s;everal &s;orts of Materials whereof Cloth is woven, as the
<HI>Nettle-Cloth,</HI> that of the <HI>Palm-leaves,</HI> of the Bark of the
<HI>Maguei</HI> among the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> which bears the <HI>Coco,</HI>
here de&s;crib'd from <HI>Du Bartas</HI>; and of the <HI>Pumpion</HI> brought
from <HI>Mecha,</HI> whereof <HI>Peireskius</HI> had a kind of Silk woven, as
<HI>Ga&s;&s;endus</HI> relates in his Life, be&s;ides which there is no
<HI>Se|ricum Vegetabile,</HI> according to our Author; for that Silk properly
is made by and from the Silk-Worm, as <HI>Julius Scaliger</HI> again&s;t
<HI>Cardan</HI> &s;hews; of which <HI>Pliny</HI> in&s;erts many a moral
Le&s;&s;on among his Ob&s;ervations. It is next ob|&s;erved, that
<HI>Pamphilia</HI> fir&s;t wove Silks; that the Emperor <HI>M. Aurel.
Antoninus</HI> fir&s;t wore them in <HI>Europe</HI>; and that 
<PB N="49" REF="74"> the Worm was fir&s;t brought into this Quarter by certain
Monks in <HI>Ju&s;tinian</HI>'s Time. That in the <HI>Summer-I&s;lands</HI>
there are large beautiful-colour'd Spiders, which &s;pin perfect raw Silk, as
<HI>Oviedo</HI> and Captain <HI>Smith</HI> relate. Of other Garments, made with
Hair, &s;uch as the Prophets wore: Grograms of Goat's Hair; whereof
<HI>Busbequius</HI> gives a more particular Account; and Chamlets of Camel's
Hair, as we may further read in <HI>Aelian.</HI> Of Flax and Hemp; that they
were fir&s;t dre&s;s'd in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and that the <HI>Egyptian</HI> and
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts wore their Ve&s;tments thereof; al&s;o of Cotton
which grows in Balls on certain Shrubs. Next of the fine Linnen made in
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Cambray,</HI> whence called Hollands and Cambricks,
which <HI>Adrian Junius</HI> de&s;cribes to be as white as &s;now, as fine as
Lawn, and as dear as Silk. Of the Sea-Wool, &s;poken of by <HI>Tertullian,</HI>
as fine as Silk according to <HI>La Cerda,</HI> which is made of the downy
Sub&s;tance growing out of the large Shell-fi&s;h call'd <HI>Pinna.</HI> Al&s;o
a kind of Stone-Cloth made from certain Stones here named, which are beaten
into &s;mall Fibres or Hairs, and &s;o woven; it is call'd by <HI>Langius,</HI>
Salamander's Wool, having the property of re|&s;i&s;ting Fire. <HI>Ferdinand
Imperatus</HI> had of it in his <HI>Mu&s;eum,</HI> and <HI>Callimachus</HI>
hung up a Taper of it in the Temple of <HI>Mi|nerva,</HI> according to
<HI>Salma&s;ius.</HI> But there is a Vegetable of the &s;ame property call'd by
the <HI>Greeks Asba&s;tos,</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Linum vivum</HI>
or incombu&s;tible Flax, and &s;ays the Car|ca&s;&s;es of Kings were wrapt in
it, when they were to be burn'd, to pre&s;erve their A&s;hes for the Urns.
<HI>Podocatter,</HI> who wrote <HI>de Rebus Cypriis</HI> in 1566, had of this
Cloth, which was &s;een by <HI>Tho. Porcacchius</HI> as he relates in his
<HI>Funeral Rites. Ludovicus Vives</HI> &s;aw the like at <HI>Lovain,</HI> as
he al&s;o relates, and <HI>Bapti&s;ta Porta,</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI> as may be
read in his <HI>Nat. Magia.</HI> Mettals were al&s;o wrought into Cloth: &s;uch
were the <HI>Attalic</HI> Garments, call'd by the <HI>Italians, Ve&s;te di
Brocato di Oro</HI>; and when the marble Coffin of <HI>Mary,</HI> the Wife of
the Emperor <HI>Honorius,</HI> was dug up at <HI>Rome</HI> in 1544, tho' her
Body was con&s;umed and turned to du&s;t, all but her Teeth and Bones, her
golden Apparel was fre&s;h; out of which, was extracted 36 Pound weight of pure
Gold, as <HI>Aldrovand</HI> records in his <HI>Mu&s;aeum Metallicum.</HI> The
<HI>Si|donians</HI> had al&s;o &s;uch Ve&s;tments, as may be &s;een in
<HI>Virgil,</HI> Aen. xi. But the &s;trange&s;t of all, was that kind of Wool
mention'd by St. <HI>Hierom</HI> and <HI>Paulus Diaconus</HI> to have rained
down from the Clouds about <HI>Artois</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> whereof Cloth
was &s;pun to the great Enrichment of the Country: <PB N="50" REF="75"> So that
as there was once <HI>Coelum e&s;catile,</HI> as <HI>Salvian</HI> &s;peaks of
the wonderful <HI>Manna,</HI> in like manner there was now <HI>Coelum
textile,</HI> as we may term it; the Sky affording both Food and Rayment. To
this Chapter is join'd an <HI>Appendix</HI> of <HI>The Plumary Art.</HI> Here
it is ob&s;erv'd to what Perfec|tion this Art was arrived in <HI>Florida,</HI>
and other Parts of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI>; where &s;uch Birds of
<HI>Orient</HI> Plumage abound, as the <HI>Phenicopter, Parrot,</HI> and
<HI>Tomincio</HI>: With the manner how they &s;trip the Quills, and pa&s;te on
the Feathers in all Shapes and Shades. What delicate Works of this kind
<HI>Fer|dinand Cortez,</HI> &s;aw in the Emperor <HI>Motizuma</HI>'s Palace at
<HI>Mexico.</HI> That Cardinal <HI>Paleotti</HI> had the Picture of St.
<HI>Hie|rom</HI> of this Workman&s;hip; and that certain Fryers had learnt the
Art. That it was not unknown even to the Ancients. That St. <HI>Hierom</HI>
mentions it; al&s;o <HI>Julius Fermicus, Pruden|tius,</HI> and <HI>Seneca.</HI>
That the&s;e Plumes &s;urpa&s;s all the Beauties of the Pencil, not only in
Lu&s;tre but Duration, and foil the Art of Painting.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>Of the Art of Mu&s;ick, with the
In&s;truments,</HI> &amp;c. From the <HI>Pythagorean</HI> Notion of Mu&s;ick in
the Spheres, the Delight of Man's Soul in Harmony is here accounted for,
according to <HI>Macrobius</HI>; al&s;o from the Body of Man, which is a living
Organ, and Life it&s;elf, the Le&s;&s;on which his Soul plays thereon. That
vocal Mu&s;ick is mo&s;t delight|ful. That <HI>Pan</HI> devi&s;ed the Imitation
of this mu&s;ical Pipe in the Throat of Man, with a <HI>Syringe</HI> or Reed,
tho' <HI>Lucretius</HI> a&s;cribes it to the whi&s;tling of the
<HI>Zephyrs</HI> in the Reeds. That in Imitation of them the Shank-bones of
Cranes were u&s;ed, whence came the <HI>Flute:</HI> Not but mu&s;ical
In&s;truments were in the World before <HI>Pan</HI>'s Time; <HI>Jubal</HI>
being the In|ventor of the <HI>Harp</HI> and <HI>Organ.</HI> That the
<HI>Egyptian Mercury</HI> invented the Lyre or Lute, by a Tortoi&s;e-&s;hell he
found on the <HI>Nile</HI>-&s;ide, to which &s;ome Nerves hung, reaching from
end to end, whereof <HI>Du Bartas</HI> has taken notice. That
<HI>Terpander</HI> encrea&s;ed the Lyre from three Strings to &s;even,
<HI>Simonides</HI> added an eighth, and <HI>David</HI> mentions a
ten-&s;tring'd In&s;trument, who invented many &s;orts; but all are divided
into &s;uch as are founded either by the <HI>Breath</HI> or <HI>Hand.</HI>
Since his Time many have been the Improvements. <HI>Leander Al|berti</HI> in
his De&s;cription of <HI>Italy</HI> relates that he &s;aw a pair of Organs, in
which, Men would think they heard Boys and Men di&s;tinctly &s;ing their Parts
in Concert; and another Pair in the Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI>'s Court, made all
of <HI>Alaba&s;|ter,</HI> which gave a loud and full Sound; al&s;o another very
<PB N="51" REF="76"> mu&s;ical Pair at <HI>Venice,</HI> made all of Gla&s;s,
which are men|tion'd by <HI>Mory&s;on</HI> in his Travels. Pope
<HI>Sylve&s;ter</HI> the Se|cond made a Pair that would play without any other
Organi&s;t than warm Water: Such <HI>Hydraulics,</HI> frequent in
<HI>Italy,</HI> are &s;ounded al&s;o with cold Water. <HI>Gaudentius Merula, de
Mi|rab. Mundi,</HI> mentions an Organ at <HI>Milan;</HI> the Pipes where|of
were made of various Materials, as Wood, Bra&s;s, White|lead, and imitated
various mu&s;ical In&s;truments. Speaking next of vocal Mu&s;ick, natural and
artificial, the Scarcity of good natural Singers is ob&s;erv'd, occa&s;ioning
the Supply of mu&s;ical In&s;truments for Delight, and to appea&s;e the Cares
of Life. Hence we are led to an <HI>Appendix, Of the Power and Efficacy of
Mu&s;ick.</HI> The Commendations of <HI>Orpheus</HI> by <HI>Horace</HI> and
<HI>Claudian,</HI> and of <HI>Silenus</HI> by <HI>Virgil;</HI> with <HI>Tho.
Ran|dolph</HI>'s Exhortation to Mu&s;ick, finely illu&s;trating the Force
thereof upon Rocks and Trees. Thus leaving things <HI>in|animate,</HI> he
proceeds to In&s;tances of the Regency of Mu|&s;ick over Creatures,
<HI>rational</HI> and <HI>irrational</HI>; among other Authorities he produces
that of <HI>Henry Stephens,</HI> who &s;ays (in <HI>Pref. ad Herod.</HI>) that
he &s;aw a Lion at <HI>London,</HI> which would for&s;ake his Food to hear
Mu&s;ick. The Delight which Deer and Elephants take therein; and that the A&s;s
only is not plea&s;ed with it. That Birds likewi&s;e are affected with
Mu|&s;ick, and Hawks tamed therewith. That it rules al&s;o in the Water, as in
the famous Story of <HI>Arion</HI> and the Dolphin; and was expected to prevail
over Hell it&s;elf, as in the at|tempt made for the Recovery of
<HI>Eurydice,</HI> with a Compli|ment to <HI>Spen&s;er</HI> out of <HI>W.
Brown</HI>'s Pa&s;torals, atte&s;ting that if <HI>Orpheus</HI> had been but
half his equal, he had not left her in tho&s;e infernal Regions. Then for
rational Creatures, here are many Examples produced to &s;hew, how Mu&s;ick has
all our Pa&s;&s;ions at Command; how Courage and Fear have been rai&s;ed by it;
how Anger has been &s;tirr'd up, and al|lay'd by it; how it exhilarates and
enlivens the Spirits, in|&s;pires Devotion, Cha&s;tity, and Civility; with an
In&s;tance of the effect of <HI>Dactyls</HI> and <HI>Spondaics.</HI> That
Mu&s;ick has al&s;o power over the Body, to keep it from drooping and
wea|rine&s;s, and cure it of Maladies; of this latter we have many particulars,
as the Cure of the Plague in <HI>Homer</HI> by Mu&s;ick; of the Fren&s;y, by
<HI>Zenocrates;</HI> of the <HI>Sciatica,</HI> from the Ex|perience of
<HI>Theophra&s;tus;</HI> and &s;ome Aches, as reported in <HI>France:</HI> The
poi&s;onous Bite of the <HI>Tarantula</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> that kind of
Fren&s;y, call'd <HI>St. Vitus</HI> his Dance, in <HI>Germany,</HI> in which,
upon hearing of a Fiddle, the Patient dances till he is tired 
<PB N="52" REF="77"> and cured; as <HI>Skenkius</HI> ob&s;erves. Hence we
proceed to the Mu&s;ick of Speech and Eloquence: Of the <HI>Grecian</HI>
Orators, who had the power of Fire and Water, to inflame and ex|tingui&s;h; to
make Peace and War. Then of &s;ome Moderns, as <HI>Savanorola,</HI> who managed
the Commonwealth with his Tongue, and <HI>Ugolin</HI> the Friar, who, by a
Sermon, moved his Audience to beat their Enemies. And if plain Speech has
&s;uch power, how much more mu&s;t Words join'd with Harmony and Numbers? Here
we have a Summary of all the foremention'd Effects of Mu&s;ick in &s;ome
Ver&s;es of <HI>Du Bartas;</HI> which is follow'd by <HI>Bapti&s;ta
Porta</HI>'s nice Attempt to a&s;cribe the wonderful Effects of Mu&s;ick to the
Vertues of the &s;everal &s;orts of Trees, whereof the In&s;truments are made,
which, &s;ays he, have a &s;ecret Property to cure Di&s;|ea&s;es more than the
Sounds that are made of them. But our Author thinks him mi&s;taken, becau&s;e
bare Words have power over Men's Minds and Spirits; &s;o &s;hews us, more
di&s;|tinctly, from <HI>Scaliger,</HI> how the Vibration or trembling of the
Air, by Mu&s;ick, affects the Spirits of Man. This is further &s;trengthen'd by
the affinity between the Soul and Mu&s;ick, ob&s;erv'd by <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>
and <HI>Macrobius,</HI> and the Argu|ment of its being no wonder that every
Creature, which has a living Soul, &s;hould be taken with Mu&s;ick, &s;ince the
Soul of the Univer&s;e, whereof every particular Soul is a Part, is made of
<HI>Harmony.</HI> This Head is concluded with an Exam|ple of the Force of
Eloquence in <HI>Pericles</HI> from <HI>Val. Maxi|mus,</HI> and in the
Philo&s;opher <HI>Hege&s;ias,</HI> who &s;o pathetically &s;et forth the Evils
of Life, that his Auditors re&s;olv'd to kill them&s;elves, according to
<HI>Cicero.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. <HI>Of the Invention of Gla&s;s, and Gla&s;s-Works.</HI>
We are here inform'd of the Ingredients whereof Gla&s;s is made; by what
Accident it was invented, from <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;ephus;</HI> the
Properties of it, how fluid and ductile while hot, how hard, clean, and clear
when cold; how broken by Poi&s;ons, exce&s;&s;ive Cold, or Heat. How Art in
forming of it imi|tates the Creation, it being made with the Breath of the
Mouth. How preciou&s;ly it is e&s;teem'd of in &s;ome Coun|tries, where it is
exchanged for Gold, according to <HI>Pigafetta.</HI> Where the be&s;t are made,
near <HI>Venice,</HI> and how. Tho' ours is &s;o brittle, that an Arti&s;t at
<HI>Rome,</HI> in <HI>Tiberius</HI> his Time, could make it malleable and
flexible, and that he was &s;ecretly made away, le&s;t the Knowledge of his Art
&s;hould make Gold contemptible. Then we come to the U&s;es of Gla&s;s in Cups
and Ve&s;&s;els, Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, Tele&s;copes, <PB N="53" REF="78">
Micro&s;copes, Thermometers, Spheres, Spectacles, where|by old Eyes become
young, &s;mall Objects are magnified, things invi&s;ible &s;een, and things
behind us brought before, and tho&s;e done in our Neighbour's Hou&s;es, or
Enemy's Tents, brought to our Knowledge without the help of Ma|gic; for which
we are referr'd to <HI>Bapti&s;ta Porta.</HI> Then we advance more to
Particulars, as that <HI>Cornelius Van Drebble,</HI> that rare Engineer of
<HI>Alcmar,</HI> who liv'd here in K. <HI>James</HI>'s Court, invented the
Micro&s;copes, whereby we di&s;cover the &s;ubtile&s;t Objects, and the
&s;malle&s;t: And that <HI>Sanctorius,</HI> a famous Phy&s;ician of
<HI>Padua,</HI> invented the Thermometers, which, in a Man's Chamber,
di&s;cover the Temper of the Air, whether hot or cold, moi&s;t or dry, or
inclining to ei|ther. That Tele&s;copes, for di&s;covering things a-far off,
were invented by <HI>Jacobus Metius</HI> of <HI>Alcmar,</HI> as <HI>Des
Cartes</HI> tells us, and perfected by <HI>Gallileo Gallilei</HI> the
<HI>Florentine;</HI> which will repre&s;ent Objects thirty times bigger than
the ap|parent Quantity, and a hundred times nearer than the appa|rent
Di&s;tance. By the&s;e, new Stars have been di&s;cover'd, and new Worlds in
them; the Moon brought down to Ex|amination, and found to be another
<HI>America.</HI> By the&s;e <HI>Tele&s;ius</HI> has given us his
<HI>Selenographia,</HI> or De&s;cription of the Countries and Provinces there;
and <HI>Van Drebble</HI> &s;aw not only the Hills and Plains, but the
Fore&s;ts, Cities and Build|ings in this Lunary World; as <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi</HI>
has written in his Life of <HI>Peiresk.</HI> And as for Burning-Gla&s;&s;es, we
have here the Account of the <HI>Roman</HI> Ships fired by <HI>Archimedes</HI>

than all the Galleys of <HI>Italy,</HI> or an Army of a Hundred Thou&s;and Men
could do, as <HI>Gaffarel</HI> from others relates. <HI>Kircher</HI> indeed
could never hit upon the Experiment, or hear of Gla&s;&s;es that would burn
above fifteen Paces di&s;tance; but <HI>Bapti&s;ta Porta</HI> declares there is
a way to make Gla&s;&s;es that would burn things at any di&s;tance, and Dr.
<HI>John Dee,</HI> in the Preface to his <HI>Monas Hieroglyphica,</HI> that it
may be made to calcine Stones and reduce them to powder. After this we come to
a Remark or two on the Spheres of <HI>Archimedes,</HI> which repre&s;ented the
Motion of the <PB N="54" REF="79"> heavenly Bodies, and is de&s;cribed by
<HI>Claudian</HI>; with the Di&s;|tinction of <HI>Kircher,</HI> that the
out&s;ide only was of Gla&s;s; yet <HI>Peter Ramus</HI> &s;peaks of two Gla&s;s
Spheres at <HI>Paris,</HI> like tho&s;e of <HI>Archimedes.</HI> Next we have an
Ob&s;ervation on the Am|phitheatre of Gla&s;s in <HI>Pliny,</HI> which was a
kind of Fo&s;&s;ile, or <HI>Ob&s;idian</HI> Gla&s;s found in
<HI>Aethiopia,</HI> black, tran&s;parent, and ea&s;ily wrought; of which was
built the &s;tately Tomb in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> by <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> for
<HI>Alexander,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> relates. <HI>Herodotus</HI> al&s;o tells
us this kind of Gla&s;s was wrought hol|low, to ca&s;e or en&s;hrine dead
Bodies, that they might be &s;een. The &s;pecular Stone was of this kind but
brighter, and like Cry&s;tal: It was al&s;o u&s;ed to &s;helter Fruits from
blighting Colds. But this kind of Stone is return'd by <HI>Pan|cirollus, inter
non inventa. Leander</HI> mentions a compleat Galley of Gla&s;s at
<HI>Venice,</HI> and Gla&s;s Organs: <HI>James Howel</HI> &s;aw &s;uch a Galley
at the <HI>Murano,</HI> as he writes in his <HI>Hi&s;tory of</HI> Venice. As
Gla&s;s is diaphanous and pa&s;&s;ive to Objects, &s;o it is al&s;o reflective,
and beats back the Objects which fall upon it, when the back&s;ide is lin'd
with Tin&s;oil, or Leaf of Tin-&s;ilver, or other Metal; and thus
Looking-Gla&s;&s;es are made, wherewith many &s;trange Feats may be perform'd,
even to the Su&s;picion of Magic and unlawful Arts.</P>
<P N="10">X. <HI>The Invention of Shipping, Sailing, and the
Mariner's Compa&s;s.</HI> This Invention of riding on the blue Roads with
wooden Hor&s;es, as the old comic Poet phra&s;es it, was highly bold as
<HI>Horace</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, and no le&s;s u&s;eful as all the World have
found it. The Motives to &s;uch Hazard are &s;hewn from the Book of
<HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> to be De&s;ire of Gain in Man, and a Willingne&s;s in God,
that the Works of his Wi&s;|dom &s;hould not lie idle. But we &s;hall admire
&s;uch Boldne&s;s the more, in con&s;idering the Simplicity of Sailing in the
fir&s;t Ages, when the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> made their Boats of Reeds and
Ru&s;hes, according to <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Lucan;</HI> &s;uch was that in
which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was pre&s;erv'd, &s;uch is &s;poken of in
<HI>I&s;aiah;</HI> al&s;o among the <HI>Indians,</HI> according to
<HI>Herodotus.</HI> The old <HI>Britains</HI> had their <HI>Naves Vitiles,</HI>
&s;ays <HI>Pliny</HI>; the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> their <HI>Corraghes,</HI> being
made of Wicker cover'd with Leather, not much bigger than a Basket; &s;uch
<HI>Strabo</HI> &s;ays he &s;ail'd to <HI>Egypt</HI> in; &s;uch were tho&s;e
which <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> learnt to make of the <HI>Britains;</HI> and &s;uch
were u&s;ed by the <HI>Babylonians,</HI> as te&s;|tifies <HI>Herodotus:</HI>
And they were &s;o light that the Ma&s;ter could carry them on Shore, as they
carried him at Sea, like the <HI>Arabian</HI> Fi&s;herman, who&s;e
Tortoi&s;e-Shell was his Shal|lop by Water, and his Hou&s;e by Land, as
<HI>Dubartas</HI> has it <PB N="55" REF="80"> from a <HI>Latin</HI> Epigram.
Such like al&s;o, for lightne&s;s, the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> u&s;e on the
<HI>Nile,</HI> and <HI>Boterus</HI> mentions &s;uch again in the
<HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> where they have al&s;o their <HI>Bal&s;a's,</HI> or
Bulru&s;hes rafted together, and row to fi&s;h in the main Sea upon them, as
may be read in <HI>Aco&s;ta.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> have likewi&s;e their
Canoes made out of one Tree hollowed, and in <HI>Greenland,</HI> Boats &s;haped
like a Shuttle, covered with Seal-Skins, and rib'd with Bones of Fi&s;hes, as
<HI>Purchas</HI> de&s;cribes. <HI>Pet. Gellius</HI> in his De&s;cription of the
<HI>Thracian Bo&s;phorus,</HI> &s;peaks of a Ship he &s;aw, laden with
<HI>A|rabian</HI> Merchandize, which had no Iron in it, but was &s;ewed
together with Cords, covered with Ro&s;in of the Frank|incence-Tree, and her
Tackling made of the Tree which bears the <HI>Indian</HI> Nut, which Mr.
<HI>Geo. Herbert</HI> de&s;cribes. But the <HI>Tyrians</HI> are reputed the
fir&s;t who improved Shipping with Ma&s;ts, Sails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
<HI>Ovid</HI> tells us that <HI>Ja&s;on</HI> was the fir&s;t Contriver of
Ships, and that his famous <HI>Argo</HI> was &s;telli|fied by A&s;tronomers.
The Shell-Fi&s;h called <HI>Nautilus,</HI> gave the fir&s;t Hint of framing a
Ship, according to <HI>Pliny,</HI> as the flying of the Kite did of the Stern;
afterwards they were magnificently made, as that Cedar Galley built by
<HI>Caligula,</HI> which had Halls, Rooms, and Gardens in it: and that of
<HI>Ptolemaeus Philopater,</HI> who built one two hundred eighty Cubits long,
fifty two Cubits from the Bottom to the upper Decks; had four hundred Banks for
four thou&s;and Rowers, with Gardens and Orchards at top of it, as
<HI>Plutarch</HI> relates in his Life of <HI>Demetrius.</HI> But the
Improvement of Navi|gation without Sails or Oars, &s;o as never to be
wind-bound, was more commendable. We have the Account in <HI>Vitruvius</HI>
that for this end the Ancients had in their Ships three Wheels on each &s;ide,
with eight <HI>radii,</HI> a Span long, projecting from each Wheel, and &s;ix
Oxen within turning the &s;ame, which ca&s;ting the Water backward, moved the
Ship on with great Speed. They had al&s;o an In&s;trument in tho&s;e Ships,
called <HI>Carrum,</HI> dividing the Hours of the Day. Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> in
his <HI>Novum Organum,</HI> &s;peaks of Boats in <HI>England</HI> to &s;ail
under Water; and <HI>Julius Scaliger,</HI> of a Ship he could make that would
&s;teer her&s;elf. This Chapter ends with the famous Re|pre&s;entation of a
Naval Fight in <HI>Claudius Cae&s;ar</HI>'s time, men|tioned by
<HI>Suetonius,</HI> and <HI>Juvenal</HI>'s Account of the Earthen Boats u&s;ed
in <HI>Aegypt.</HI> So we proceed to the <HI>Appendix, of the Mariners
Compa&s;s,</HI> wherein we are inform'd that <HI>John Goia,</HI> or <HI>Flavius
Goia</HI> of <HI>Amalphi</HI> in <HI>Campania</HI> in the King|dom of
<HI>Naples,</HI> fir&s;t invented the Compa&s;s, who is therefore 
<PB N="56" REF="81"> celebrated by <HI>Du Bartas.</HI> By what Stars Pilots
were di|rected before the &s;aid Invention, and Travellers in the De|&s;erts of
<HI>Arabia,</HI> and how they were oblig'd to &s;top when the Sky was clouded,
therefore our Author &s;ays of the Load&s;tone, as <HI>Rablais</HI> of the
Mil&s;tone, that 'tis the mo&s;t precious of all others. Then follows
<HI>Claudian</HI>'s De&s;cription of the <HI>Magnet,</HI> its two Properties of
<HI>Attraction</HI> and <HI>Direction,</HI> which gave Invention to the
Mariners Compa&s;s, who&s;e Needle, touched therewith, points its Lilly-Hand to
the North, in any part of the World. The Inhabitants of <HI>Taprobana</HI>
having not the <HI>Pole-Star</HI> to &s;ail by, carried certain Birds on board,
which being &s;et at liberty, flew by natural In&s;tinct to the Shore; &s;o
gave direction to the Sailors, according to <HI>Pliny.</HI> The
<HI>Sy|rians</HI> and the <HI>Bactrians,</HI> according to <HI>Curtius,</HI>
travelled by the Guidance of Stars; but the <HI>Arabians,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Lud.
Bartema,</HI> in certain Wooden Boxes on their Camels, have the Load|&s;tone
like the Compa&s;s, to &s;teer their Cour&s;e by over the De&s;arts. Some
a&s;cribe this Invention to the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>; and Dr. <HI>Gilbert, de
Magnete, lib.</HI> 1. affirms that <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> brought it fir&s;t
into <HI>Italy, An.</HI> 1260, having learnt it from them. <HI>Ludovicus
Vertomanus</HI> reports, that he &s;aw about the Year 1500, the <HI>Indian</HI>
Pilot of his Ship, &s;ailing in <HI>Java,</HI> &s;teer by a Compa&s;s, made as
in <HI>Europe.</HI> This Head is con|cluded with a Remark, that our Compa&s;s
is not yet brought to due Perfection, for that the <HI>Magnetic</HI> Needle
does not yet point exactly to the North in all Meridians, to the cau&s;e of
much Error in Navigation. <HI>Van Helmont</HI> profe&s;&s;es a way to rectify
this Inconvenience, which, tho' &s;omewhat fanciful, as appears by our Author's
Account of it, 'tis yet to be wi&s;h'd &s;ome Devices might be found to amend
that Imper|fection.</P>
<P N="11">XI. <HI>The Art of Cicuration and taming of wild
Bea&s;ts.</HI> It appears by the Introduction of this Chapter, that we have not
the &s;ame Title to this Book which our Author intended, and that he had call'd
it <HI>Hi&s;toria Naturae Subactae</HI>; therefore thinks this Chapter no
Digre&s;&s;ion. He begins with a Quo|tation from the New Te&s;tament,
&s;hewing, that <HI>every kind of Bea&s;t is tamed by Mankind;</HI> gives
&s;eveval Examples of the Elephant, and refers to many Stories of their
Officiou&s;ne&s;s and Docility in one of <HI>Lip&s;ius</HI> his Epi&s;tles; and
of the Lion out of <HI>Pliny</HI>; that Tygers drew the Coach of
<HI>Bacchus,</HI> from <HI>Silius Italicus</HI>; and that of
<HI>Heliogabalus,</HI> as <HI>Lampridius</HI> re|lates. <HI>Martial</HI>
mentions the &s;ame in <HI>Domitian</HI>'s time; that the fierce
<HI>By&s;on,</HI> and Stag were taught to do the &s;ame; and 
<PB N="57" REF="82"> at <HI>Walton</HI> upon <HI>Thames,</HI> our Author &s;aw
four Stags draw a &s;mall Coach. <HI>Lip&s;ius</HI> in his Notes upon
<HI>Tacitus,</HI> &s;peaks of Dogs drawing a Chariot at <HI>Rome</HI>; and
<HI>Textor,</HI> of O&s;|triches that drew the Coach of the Emperor
<HI>Firmus.</HI> The Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> the &s;econd, had a Deer which
would receive a Bridle and a Rider, and run again&s;t the fleete&s;t Hor&s;e,
as <HI>Mich. Neander</HI> relates. <HI>Martial</HI> mentions al&s;o a Deer
u&s;ed to a Bridle, and <HI>Camden</HI> in his Annals of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI>
that Sir <HI>Hierom Bowes</HI> brought from <HI>Mu&s;covia</HI> certain
<HI>Does</HI> of admirable Swiftne&s;s, which being yoked and coupled in a
Coach, would carry a Man with great Speed. Next we have an Account of tame
Panthers, Leopards, and Lions to hunt with, as the King of <HI>Cambala</HI>'s,
which <HI>Aelian</HI> mentions, and <HI>Scaliger</HI>; and Mr.
<HI>Mory&s;on</HI> &s;peaks of Leopards &s;o tame, that they would leap up
behind the Hunt&s;man on his Hor&s;e, and &s;it like a Dog, and &s;oon
di&s;patch a Hart, which &s;hews the Excellence of Man's Abilities to &s;ubdue
other Creatures; but as <HI>Xenophon</HI> ob&s;erves, it is far ea&s;ier taming
any Creature than Man; and <HI>Seneca</HI> has a Reflection to the &s;ame
purpo&s;e, that no Creature is &s;o wayward, fierce, and untractable as Man. We
have next an Account from <HI>Strabo,</HI> of a Crocodile that had been tamed,
and Dragons mentioned by <HI>Seneca</HI> to have crept tamely upon Men's
Tables, among their Cups; and of a four-legged Serpent in <HI>Cairo,</HI> grown
familiar and harmle&s;s. Many In&s;tances of Birds; as, O&s;triches drawing a
Coach; Eagles enured to fly at Fowl like Hawks; a Crow taught to fly at
Partridges, and Wild-Ducks made Decoys. Of Sea-Animals; the <HI>Mannti,</HI> or
Sea-Cow is in&s;tanced, from <HI>Peter Martyr</HI>; the Sea-Hor&s;e, from
<HI>Leo Afer</HI>; and the Fi&s;h called <HI>Rever&s;us,</HI> by which the
<HI>Indians</HI> caught others, as is related by <HI>Bodin,</HI> in his
<HI>Theatrum Naturae,</HI> al&s;o by <HI>Purchas</HI> and <HI>P. Martyr.
Pliny</HI>'s Dolphins, which would &s;uffer Correction like Setting-Dogs, as
<HI>Oppian</HI> al&s;o te&s;tifies, and of Otters taught to drive Fi&s;h into
the Net, according to <HI>Cardan.</HI> Al&s;o &s;everal Examples of Wild
Bea&s;ts tamed for Sport and Plea&s;ure, as well as Service; &s;uch were the
Dancing Camels which <HI>Leo</HI> &s;aw, and the Elephants which danced on the
Ropes, in <HI>Seneca,</HI> with the manner of teaching them upon a hot Floor,
from <HI>Sandys</HI> in his Travels. The Elephant <HI>Busbequius</HI> &s;aw at
<HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which danced and play'd at Ball. The Bear which
danced to the Mu&s;ick of his own Tabor, and then begg'd for Reward, &s;een by
<HI>Neander.</HI> The Dance of Hor&s;es at the Marriage of the Duke of
<HI>Florence,</HI> atte&s;ted by Sir <HI>K. Digby</HI>; and the A&s;s &s;een by
<HI>Leo</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> which would <PB N="58" REF="83"> vie Feats
with <HI>Banks</HI> his Hor&s;e, that rare Ma&s;ter of the
<HI>Ca|balli&s;tic</HI> Art. Here we have a Story of the dangerous Effects of
&s;uch Dancing Hor&s;es among the <HI>Sabarites,</HI> when their Enemies the
<HI>Crotonians</HI> brought Mu&s;ick into the Field of Battle, from
<HI>Diodorus Siculus, Aelian,</HI> and <HI>Pliny.</HI> To &s;hew that a Baboon
has play'd upon the Guittar, and a Monky at Che&s;s, we are referr'd to
<HI>Balt. Ca&s;tilione.</HI> Of Birds, are mentioned the Talking Starlings,
Pyes and Crows at <HI>Rome</HI>; Cardinal <HI>A&s;canio</HI>'s Parrot would
&s;ay the <HI>Creed,</HI> and another in <HI>Spain</HI> which would &s;ing the
<HI>Gamut,</HI> as <HI>John Barnes</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Frier relates, in
his learned Book <HI>de Aequivocatione.</HI> Many of the&s;e Examples are
&s;um'd up by <HI>Martial</HI> in his Book of <HI>Shows, Epig.</HI> 105 which
is here recited, with a Tran&s;la|tion. La&s;tly, it is ob&s;erved how Animals
will learn the Language of their Country, &s;o far as is nece&s;&s;ary for
their Direction, as Elephants, Hor&s;es, and Mules, which <HI>Claudian</HI> has
taken notice of; and that Dogs have been trained for the Wars by the old
<HI>Britons</HI> and <HI>Gauls,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Camden</HI>
relate; &s;o have Bulls, Bears, and Lions, according to <HI>Lucre|tius,</HI>
here cited. This, with &s;ome other Citations from <HI>Grotius, Plutarch,</HI>
and <HI>Origen,</HI> &s;hewing that the Wit and Rea&s;on of Man reduces all
other Creatures to his Service and Subjection, concludes this Chapter.</P>
<P N="12">XII. <HI>Of certain Sports and Extravagancies of Art.</HI>
In this la&s;t Chapter of the Book, it is &s;et forth, that as Nature has her
<HI>Ludicra,</HI> &s;o has Art; and that Art as well as Nature is never more
wonderful than in &s;maller Works: That St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> admired as
much at the Tooth of a Moth as that of an Elephant. So we de&s;cend to
Particulars, as the Ivory Ants of <HI>Callicrates</HI>; the little Ivory
Chariot, Hor&s;es and Dri|ver of <HI>Myrmecides,</HI> to be cover'd with the
Wings of a Fly; and the Ship with all her Tackling, which a Bee could hide,
according to <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Aelian.</HI> Next are <HI>Vulcan</HI>'s
Nets, mentioned out of <HI>Ovid.</HI> The Waggon and Oxen of Gla&s;s, which
might be concealed by a Fly, in <HI>Cardan</HI>; and the neat little Wooden
Lock, mentioned by <HI>Leander Alberti</HI>; which introduces the rare
Workman&s;hip of <HI>Mark Scaliot</HI> a Black&s;mith of <HI>London,</HI> in
his Iron Lock and Key and Gold Chain of forty three Links, all drawn by a Flea,
and all, with the Flea, weighing but one Grain and a half; as witne&s;&s;es
<HI>John Stow</HI> in his <HI>Annals,</HI> who &s;aw it. <HI>Scaliger</HI>
al&s;o men|tions a Flea with a Gold Chain, and <HI>Leo Afer</HI> &s;uch a
Chain, for which the Arti&s;t had a Suit of Cloth of Gold be&s;towed upon him
by the <HI>Sultan. Hadr. Junius</HI> &s;aw at <HI>Mechlin,</HI> a 
<PB N="59" REF="84"> Basket made of a Cherry-Stone, which held fourteen pair of
Dice, who&s;e Spots were vi&s;ible. Then we have notice taken of the precious
Stone in a Ring, repre&s;enting <HI>Phaeton,</HI> his Chariot and Steeds,
tumbling into the River, as men|tion'd in <HI>Galen</HI>; and <HI>Geo.
Whitehead</HI>'s Ship, with all her Tackling, moving of it&s;elf on a Table,
with Rowers, a Wo|man playing on the Lute, a Whelp howling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as
affirmed by <HI>Schottus,</HI> in <HI>Itin. Italiae</HI>; al&s;o,
<HI>Gafferell</HI>'s Account, in his <HI>Unheard of Curio&s;ities,</HI> of the
Clock at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> which had on it a Company of Shepherds playing on
the Bagpipes, with others dancing by Couples thereto, in Time and Mea&s;ure.
Here is al&s;o mentioned the Chain, in <HI>Cardan,</HI> &s;o little and &s;o
light, that when it fell to the Ground, it would not break, tho' made of
Gla&s;s; and the Iron Spider in <HI>Walchius</HI>'s ninth Fable; to which our
Author applies the Ver&s;es in <HI>Dubartas,</HI> celebrating the Iron Fly of
<HI>Regiomontanus</HI>; al&s;o the Bear and Lion of Gold (pre&s;ented to the
<HI>Landgrave</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI>) each a Middle-Finger's Length, and
both weighing but a <HI>French</HI> Crown, for which the Arti&s;t was rewarded
with three thou|&s;and Crowns. This is followed with <HI>Claudian</HI>'s
Epigram <HI>de Quadriga Marmorea,</HI> and the Tran&s;lation; and the whole
Book concludes with a Reference to many more In&s;tances of the like nature, in
<HI>John Trade&s;cant</HI>'s Ark at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and the Archives of
&s;everal Princes and private Per&s;ons, who have their <HI>Pinacotheca</HI>'s
and <HI>Technematophylacia</HI> to pre&s;erve all Rarities; more particularly
that of <HI>Bernard Paludanus</HI> a Phy&s;ician in <HI>Holland,</HI> upon
which here is an Epigram quoted, and Information of another among

<P>THis <HI>Engli&s;h Theological Library</HI> may well recommend
it&s;elf to the Notice of the <HI>Briti&s;h Librarian,</HI> &s;eeing the
Author, who was Hi&s;toriographer to the Elector of <HI>Bran|denburg,</HI> 
<PB N="60" REF="85"> has &s;o &s;incerely intended therein the Honour of the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, and has common-placed, &s;o &s;uccinctly and, for
the generality, &s;o methodically, above <HI>&s;ixteen Hundred Writers of
Divinity</HI> in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> un|der
&s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Heads. But being writ|ten in <HI>Latin</HI>
and printed abroad, at <HI>Koningsberg</HI> in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> it &s;eems
not to have yet made &s;ufficiently its way among &s;ome of our Readers, to
whom it might have been u&s;eful in &s;everal re&s;pects; and po&s;&s;ibly
that, among the re&s;t, of in|&s;piring an Ambition to give us a more enlarged
and perfect Plan upon this Subject: For, &s;trictly &s;peaking, tho' &s;uch a
&s;piritual Army, of all ranks; is here mu&s;ter'd up, many who were eminent
among us are omitted, and &s;everal enli&s;ted who little de&s;erve &s;uch
Di&s;tinction; &s;ome al&s;o, who were Writers in different Sciences, are not
very properly perhaps introduced here; and, of mo&s;t, we have only the bare
Names, with the &s;horte&s;t Reference to tho&s;e Parts of their Works, which
concern the re&s;pective Topics, under which they are a&s;&s;embled. But the
Author's Aim was Variety and Di&s;patch; and rather to bring a great number of
Writers into a little Compa&s;s, than either to appear &s;everely &s;crupu|lous
in his Choice, and always di&s;tinctly acquainted with their Characters, or to
make his Readers con&s;tantly &s;o with the Editions of their Works. The Book
will however be very &s;erviceable to any Reader or Writer upon the Subjects
herein treated of. It will yield Matter of Recollection to tho&s;e who are even
mo&s;t conver&s;ant in our Theological Au|thors, and to tho&s;e who are mo&s;t
inqui&s;itive after them, continual Directions for further Satisfaction. The
Author neglected no Advantages to render it thus far u&s;eful; he &s;eems to
have con&s;ulted our Catalogues very diligently, which &s;pecify tho&s;e
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Authors who have written upon the &s;everal Parts of
Scripture, and other Points of Divinity; and further, for his purpo&s;e, to
have made good U&s;e of his Time while he was in the Library at
<HI>Oxford,</HI> among &s;everal of the Books them&s;elves which they refer to,
as al&s;o of the Conver&s;ation he had with Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> and other

<P>As for the Method and Contents more particularly of this Work;
after the Author's Dedication to the <HI>Elector</HI> afore|&s;aid, and a
learned Epi&s;tle to the Reader, he opens it with a copious Preface, concerning

of</HI> DRAMATIC <HI>Repre&s;entations in this Nation. In a Dialogue of</HI>
PLAYS <HI>and</HI> PLAYERS. 8vo. 1699. pages 32.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>WHen this Pamphlet was publi&s;h'd, there was a Controver&s;y on
foot about the Stage; and while others wrote to &s;hew what it then
<HI>was,</HI> our Author, as a Topic not touch'd upon, ob|&s;erves what it
<HI>had been.</HI> He apologizes to tho&s;e who may ima|gine his Subject
trivial, by producing a Player, who was a Saint; and referring to Examples of
Merit in the Di&s;cour&s;e it&s;elf: 
<Q REND="inline">"If the <HI>major</HI> Part of them (as he
concludes his Preface) fall un|der a different Character, it is the general
Unhappine&s;s of Mankind, that the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> are the
<HI>wor&s;t.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Dialogue</HI> is held between <HI>Lovewit</HI> and
<HI>Truman</HI> an old <HI>Ca|valier,</HI> who knew the Stage in the Reign of
K. <HI>Charles</HI> I. From the&s;e we learn, how much the Actors before the
Civil Wars &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed their Succe&s;&s;ors: Why they did not now revive
<HI>Ben John|&s;on</HI>'s Plays. Where, before the Wars, the Town &s;upported
<HI>five</HI> Play-hou&s;es at once; and in which of them they always acted by
Day-light: That now the Plays in <HI>two</HI> Hou&s;es only, would hardly draw
an Audience, without a Signior <HI>Fideli</HI> or a Mon&s;ieur <HI>L'Abbe.</HI>
That <HI>Edward Allen</HI> built a Play-hou&s;e, al&s;o <HI>Dulwich</HI>
College in 1619. Then we have a little Hi&s;tory of the Actors during the
Rebellion; &s;hewing how honourably they &s;erved in the King's Army. Next, how
they return'd to acting, but pri|vately; and, in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Time, at
<HI>Holland-Hou&s;e.</HI> How the Companies reviv'd after the Re&s;toration.
Where <HI>Scenes</HI> were in|troduced by Sir <HI>W. Davenant.</HI> When Women
fir&s;t acted. A Character of Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Book again&s;t the Stage.
That our ancient Plays were of religious Subjects, in many Examples from
<HI>Stow,</HI> Sir <HI>W. Dugdale, Fitz-Stephens,</HI> Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> the
Play of the <HI>Pardoner</HI> and <HI>Frene,</HI> &amp;c. When Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> fir&s;t had Players, and of Noblemen's Companies. The

<HI>&amp;c. Enprynted by</HI> <HI REND="blackletterType">William Caxton</HI>
<HI>at</HI> We&s;tme&s;tre. Folio, 1477. 75 Leaves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This
is a Title gather'd from what the <HI>Tran&s;lator</HI> mentions in his
Preface, and the <HI>Printer,</HI> in his Conclu&s;ion of the Book; for the Art
of Printing had not yet arrived at the Di&s;tinction of <HI>Title-pages</HI> in
Form. Further, we may remark of this antique <HI>Specimen</HI> of that, then,
new Art in <HI>England,</HI> that if it is not our fir&s;t Book printed here,
it may be the &s;econd, tho' printed &s;o late in the Year above-mention'd as
<HI>November</HI>; and tho' &s;ome other &s;maller Work might be printed by
<HI>Caxton</HI> the &s;ame Year. For tho' the Knowledge of two, printed before
it, by him, is de&s;cended to us; yet one is expre&s;sly &s;aid to be printed
abroad, and the other has no place mention'd where it was printed. Dr.
<HI>Conyers Middleton</HI> ob&s;erves, 
<Q REND="inline">"It has been generally a&s;&s;erted and
believ'd, that all <HI>Caxton</HI>'s Books were printed in the Ab|bey of
<HI>Westmin&s;ter</HI>; yet we have no A&s;&s;urance of it from him|&s;elf, nor
any mention of the place before 1477."</Q> Which Ob|&s;ervation is plainly
drawn from the Date of this Book, and it appears thereby to be the fir&s;t, at
lea&s;t now in being, which was printed at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>; 
<Q REND="inline">"So that he had been printing &s;everal Years
without telling us where."</Q> See the &s;aid Doctor's <HI>Ori|gin of Printing
in England,</HI> 4<HI>to. Cambr.</HI> 1735. <HI>p.</HI> 20. We are in|form'd
there is in being a fair MS of this Tran&s;lation, and, what &s;ome may think
yet a greater Curio&s;ity, an Illumination in it, repre&s;enting King
<HI>Edward</HI> IV. his Queen, and the Prince, with the Picture al&s;o of this
<HI>Antony Wydeville</HI> Earl <HI>Rivers,</HI> pre&s;enting <HI>Caxton</HI> to
the King. But more particularly of the printed Book, we ob&s;erve, it is
perform'd on a good thick Paper, in which may be di&s;cern'd its Maker's Mark
to be &s;omewhat like a Pair of Horns, with a Flower over them. The Pages have
no Num|bers at top, nor Signatures, or Catch-words at bottom; the&s;e be|ing
more modern Improvements in Printing, at lea&s;t in <HI>England.</HI> The
Divi&s;ion of the Chapters is &s;eldom by any larger Space than the other
lines; only the three fir&s;t lines of every Chapter being &s;horter than the
re&s;t, leave room, towards the Margin, for the <HI>initial</HI> Letter, which
is always a &s;mall one; and the &s;econd Let|ter of the Word which begins
every Chapter, is always a Capi|tal. As to <HI>Orthography,</HI> the &s;ame
Words are not always &s;pell'd alike, and &s;everal of the Proper Names are
much ob&s;cur'd by the old Manner of &s;pelling them, e&s;pecially after the
<HI>French</HI> Copy: and as to <HI>Pointing,</HI> there are but two &s;orts of
Stops u&s;ed; the one, a little Da&s;h, the other, a little Cro&s;s; and
&s;eldom either u&s;ed as a Period at the End of a complete Sentence, it being
thought &s;ufficient Di&s;tinction to allow a little longer Space there than
be|tween other Words, and to begin the next Sentence with a Capi|tal. More
Ob&s;ervations might hence be made on the Rudiments of Printing in
<HI>England</HI>; but to tho&s;e who are not curious after &s;uch Inquiries,
po&s;&s;ibly the greater Number, the&s;e may be e|nough. Of the noble Earl
<HI>Rivers,</HI> who tran&s;lated this Book, much might be written: therefore
we &s;hall only ob&s;erve here, that he publi&s;h'd one or more Books after
this, and refer tho&s;e who would know more of him to the Chronicles, and
e&s;pecially to <HI>Dugdale's Baronage</HI>; where it may appear what a Man of
&s;u|perior. Merit and Dignity he was among many eminent of his Name; al&s;o
how he was barbarou&s;ly put to death in <HI>June</HI> 1483, at
<HI>Pontefract</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> by the Procurement of
<HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> then Protector, being aged
about 41 Years, as we compute from the Account of his Age at the Death of his
Mo|ther <HI>Jacquett</HI> Dutche&s;s of <HI>Bedford</HI> in 1472, as it
&s;tands upon Re|cord in the <HI>E&s;cheats.</HI></NOTE>.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t Page of this Book begins with the Earl's Preface or
Introduction. Herein he ob&s;erves, that every hu|man Creature is &s;ubject to
the Storms of Fortune, and per|plex'd <PB N="64" REF="89"> with worldly
Adver&s;ity, of which he had largely had his Part; but having been reliev'd by
the Goodne&s;s of God, he was exhorted to di&s;po&s;e his recover'd Life to his
Service. And under&s;tanding there was to be a Jubilee and Pardon at <HI>St.
James's</HI> in <HI>Spain, an.</HI> 1473. he determin'd upon a Voyage thither:
&s;o in <HI>July</HI> the &s;ame Year, &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Southampton</HI>;
when, a wor&s;hipful Gentleman in his Company, named <HI>Lowys de
Bretaylles,</HI> lent him to pa&s;s over the Time, this Book of the <HI>Sayings
of the Philo&s;ophers,</HI> in <HI>French,</HI> which had been tran&s;lated
from the <HI>Latin</HI> by Me&s;&s;ire <HI>Johan de Teonville,</HI> Provo&s;t
of <HI>Paris.</HI> The Earl was very much af|fected with the whole&s;ome and
&s;weet Sayings therein of the <HI>Paynems</HI>; and finding how 
<Q REND="inline">"it &s;peaketh univer&s;ally to the Example, Weel,
and Doctryne of alle Kynges, Prynces, and to People of every E&s;tate; lawdes
Vertu and Science, blames Vices and Ignorance;"</Q> tho' he could not then, nor
in all that Pilgrimage, over&s;ee it well at his Plea&s;ure, thro' 
<PB N="65" REF="90"> the Di&s;po&s;itions that belong to the Taker of a Jubilee
and Pardon, and the great Acquaintance he found there of wor|&s;hipful Folks,
he intended at a more convenient Time to be better acquainted with it.
Remaining in this Opinion after the King commanded him to attend upon the
Prince, and having then lei&s;ure, he tran&s;lated it into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
which had not been before done: But as there were divers Copies of this Book,
differing from each other, he concludes with intimating his hopes, that he
&s;hall not be cen&s;ured for that which he has follow'd; or his Tran&s;lation
judg'd of by tho&s;e which vary from it.</P>
<P>The Work it&s;elf opens with the Sayings of <HI>Sedechias;</HI>
&s;o goes on with tho&s;e of many eminent Ancients, as <HI>Homer, Solon,
Hyppocrates, Pythagoras, Diogenes, Socrates, Plato, Ari&s;totle, Alexander,
Ptolemy, Seneca,</HI> St. <HI>Gregory, Galen,</HI> and &s;ome few others; all
whom have a Chapter a-piece be|&s;tow'd upon their Sayings. But the concluding
Chapter comprehends the Sayings of &s;everal Per&s;ons; fir&s;t, of tho&s;e
who&s;e Names are remember'd, and la&s;tly, &s;uch as are <HI>ano|nymous;</HI>
from which, as the <HI>Apopthegms</HI> of mo&s;t of tho&s;e Ancients are now
more directly tran&s;lated from the origi|nal Languages, in which they were
deliver'd, we &s;hall only give this one Example.. 
<Q REND="inline">"Ther cam byfore a Kyng thre Wy&s;emen; the one
was a <HI>Greke,</HI> the other a <HI>Jewe,</HI> and the therde a
<HI>Sara&s;yn;</HI> of whom the &s;ayd Kyng de&s;irid, that ych of them wold
utter &s;om good and notable Sen|tence. Then the <HI>Greke</HI> &s;ayd, I may
wele correcte and amende my <HI>Thoughtis,</HI> but not my <HI>Wordes:</HI>
Then the <HI>Jewe</HI> &s;ayd, I have mervayll of them that <HI>&s;aye</HI>
thinges <HI>prejudicial,</HI> where <HI>Silence</HI> were more
<HI>prouffitable:</HI> And the <HI>Sara&s;yn</HI> &s;ayd, I am
<HI>May&s;ter</HI> over my Wordes, or it be pronounced; but when it is
&s;poken, I am <HI>Servaunt</HI> there|to. And it was asked one of them; Who
might be called a <HI>Kyng?</HI> And he an&s;werd, He that is not
<HI>&s;ubgett</HI> to his owne Will.</Q></P>
<P>At the end of the Tran&s;lation of this Work, there is a
remarkable Chapter added of three Leaves (which concludes the whole Volume) by
<HI>William Caxton,</HI> or in his Name: For, as it contains a Tran&s;lation
from the <HI>French,</HI> of tho&s;e Sarca&s;ms of <HI>Socrates,</HI> again&s;t
the female Sex, which our no|ble Tran&s;lator of the re&s;t, had purpo&s;ely
pa&s;s'd over, in the proper Place, under the Chapter of that Philo&s;opher;
the Reader is left to judge, if the &s;aid Earl &s;eriou&s;ly intended to 
<PB N="66" REF="91"> favour the Fair, by &s;uch an Omi&s;&s;ion, in the middle
of his Book, whether his Printer would probably make &s;o free as to publi&s;h
it, of his own accord, tho' in his own Name, more con&s;picuou&s;ly at the end
of it. If it is a piece of <HI>Fi|ne&s;&s;e,</HI> it is artfully enough
conducted, to expo&s;e them more notoriou&s;ly, under the Notion of forbearing
to do it at all. We never read that the Ca&s;e has been &s;o interpreted, nor
can &s;ay, in what Vein or Air Mai&s;ter <HI>Caxton</HI>'s Apology for the
&s;aid Addition was written, or is to be read; but there are in it the
following Expre&s;&s;ions. 
<Q REND="inline">"I <HI>fynde</HI> that my &s;aide Lord hath left
out certayn and dyverce Conclu&s;ions towchyng <HI>Women!</HI> wherein I
mervaylle that my &s;ayd Lord hath not wreton them, ne what hath mevyd him &s;o

it in his Book; or ellys for the very Affectyon, Love and good Wylle that he
hath unto <HI>alle Ladyes</HI> and Gentylwomen, he thought that
<HI>Socrates</HI> &s;pared the Sothe, and wrote of Women more than Trouthe. For
if he had made fawte in wryting of Women, he ought not, ne &s;hold not be

<P>The Tran&s;lator, in his <HI>Preface</HI> to the fir&s;t Volume,
having &s;poken much in Commendation of <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> and having a|mong
the re&s;t diligently read the four Volumes of Sir <HI>John Froi&s;&s;art,</HI>
he judg'd them nece&s;&s;ary and proper to be ren|der'd into
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;ince they treat of <HI>the famous Acts done in our
Parts,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and &s;pecially redound to the Honour of</HI>
Engli&s;hmen; which Chronicle begins at the Reign of K. <HI>Ed|ward</HI> III.
and continues to the beginning of K. <HI>Henry</HI> IV. containing the Space of
three&s;core and fourteen Years, that is from 1326 to 1400. He then be&s;peaks
the favourable Reception of his Labour as to his not following his Author word
for word, &s;ince he tru&s;ts that he has kept to the true Sentence (or
Sen&s;e) of the Matter, and for naming all Per|&s;ons, Countries, Cities,
Towns, Rivers, or Fields, as he found them in <HI>French.</HI> And tho' he has
not given every Lord, Knight, or 'Squire his true Addition, yet tru&s;ts he 
<PB N="69" REF="94"> has not &s;werved from the true Sentence of the Matter.
And where he has named the Di&s;tance between Places, by Miles and Leagues,
they mu&s;t be under&s;tood according to the Cu&s;tom of the Countries where
they are named, being in &s;ome Places longer than in others. This is the
Sen&s;e of his &s;aid Preface; after which follows</P>
<P>The <HI>Prologue</HI> of Sir <HI>John Froi&s;&s;art</HI>; which is
the fir&s;t Chapter. Herein we are inform'd, That he propo&s;es to take his
Foundation out of the true Chronicles, compiled by that Right Reverend,
di&s;creet and &s;age Ma&s;ter <HI>John le Bel,</HI> &s;ometime Canon in St.
<HI>Lambert</HI>'s of <HI>Liege,</HI> who with great Diligence, Charge and
Co&s;t, through the Encourage|ment and Intelligence he received from Sir
<HI>John</HI> of <HI>Hay|nault,</HI> continued it all his Days. Further, That
our Au|thor <HI>Froi&s;&s;art</HI> always inclining to the&s;e Studies,
frequented the Company of divers Noble and Great Lords, as well in <HI>France,
England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> as other Countries, and had Knowledge from
them of the Adventures that befel, e&s;pe|cially &s;ince the great Battle of
<HI>Poitiers,</HI> where King <HI>John</HI> of <HI>France</HI> was taken
Pri&s;oner, before which time he was but young: Yet took upon him as &s;oon as
he came from School, to write and recite the &s;aid Book, and bare the &s;ame
com|piled into <HI>England,</HI> and pre&s;ented the Volume to
<HI>Philippa</HI> of <HI>Haynault,</HI> the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> who
received it to his great Profit and Advancement. But becau&s;e the &s;ame Book
might not be &s;ufficiently correct, he enterpri&s;ed this Hi|&s;tory on the
afore&s;aid Ordynance and true Foundation, at the In&s;tance and Reque&s;t of a
dear Lord of his, Sir <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Namure,</HI> Knight, Lord of
<HI>Beaufort.</HI> And this is the Sub&s;tance at his <HI>Prologue</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>Further of this Author, Sir JOHN FROISSART, and his CHRONICLE,
we have taken the pains to give our Reader the following more perfect Account,
chiefly from his own Words, than has hitherto been drawn together by any other
Writer.</P> 
<P>He was born at <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> as him&s;elf tells us,
Vol. II. (of this Edition) fol. 29. and in the Year 1337, as we gather al&s;o
from his own Words. For he came fir&s;t over into <HI>England</HI> when
<HI>Edward</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and his Prince&s;s were going to their
Government of <HI>Aquitain,</HI> Vol. II. fol. 319. b. Which by his own Account
(in the <HI>French</HI> Copies) was in 1361 (but accord|ing to our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lation, Vol. II. fol. 305. the Year fol|lowing) being
then aged 24 Years. The Intere&s;t thro' which he came recommended to the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, and his laudable Undertaking to enlarge and continue
<HI>John le Bel</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, chiefly, of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Conque&s;ts in <HI>France,</HI> &s;oon brought him into familiar Conver&s;ation
with Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Di&s;tinc|tion. He was made one of the Clerks
of the Chamber to Queen <HI>Philippa,</HI> Wife of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. as
he tells us him&s;elf; was afterwards knighted; and, being an Eccle&s;ia&s;tic,
well be|neficed in the Church. After he had been here about five Years, in
which Time he had travell'd almo&s;t all over <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was well
known in King <HI>David</HI>'s Court, Vol. II. fol. 158, 161. b. we meet with
him at <HI>Burdeaux,</HI> when the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Son, afterwards
King <HI>Richard</HI> II. was born there, <HI>Anno</HI> 1366. He intended to
have waited on the Prince in his Expedition to <HI>Spain,</HI> but was &s;ent
back by him to continue his Attendance on the Queen his Mother, Vol. II. Cap.
200. He &s;eems to have &s;taid not above two Years in <HI>England,</HI> before
he left this Kingdom for a long Time, being ab&s;ent about <HI>Twenty Eight
Years.</HI> In which &s;pace he probably obtained his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Preferments abroad, being Canon and Trea&s;urer of <HI>Chimay</HI> in
<HI>Heynault,</HI> and of <HI>Li&s;le</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> al&s;o
Chaplain to <HI>Guy</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tellon,</HI> Earl of <HI>Blois,</HI> as he
mentions, Vol. II. fol 242. And Rector of <HI>Le|&s;cines</HI> on the Mount,
near <HI>Mons</HI> in <HI>Heynault,</HI> according to <HI>Le Laboureur's
Introd. a L'Hi&s;t. de Cha.</HI> VI. p. 69. In all this Time he continu'd his
<HI>Chronicle,</HI> from the Reports of the mo&s;t credible and intelligent
Per&s;ons, he met with in every Prince's Court to which he remov'd, and he
&s;eems to have given Copies of the &s;everal Parts as he fini&s;h'd them, to
his Patrons; for many Quires thereof finely illuminated, were in the Cu&s;tody
of <HI>Louis</HI> Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> in 1381, intended by the Author to be
&s;ent to the King of <HI>England. Le Laboureur Hi&s;t. de Cha.</HI> VI. <HI>en
la Vie de Louis Duc d' Anjou.</HI> But our Author admires none of tho&s;e
Courts, &s;o much as that of <HI>Ga&s;ton</HI> Earl of <HI>Foix,</HI> at
<HI>Ortai&s;e</HI> in <HI>Bearn,</HI> which was the grande&s;t Market in
<HI>Europe</HI> for Tydings or News, e&s;pecially of all Martial Adventures.
Here he was courteou&s;ly entertain'd in 1388, for twelve Weeks, and to that
Earl he pre&s;ented his Collection of <HI>Wence&s;laus</HI> of
<HI>Bohemia,</HI> Duke of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI>'s Book, called <HI>Meliader</HI>
or Songs, Ballads, Ron|deaux and Virelays, which that Duke had compo&s;ed, Vol.
II. fol. 30. He returned not into <HI>England,</HI> till King <HI>Richard</HI>
was arrived from his Expedition in <HI>Ireland,</HI> ib. fol. 252, and the
Peace was concluded for four Years between <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>France,</HI> ib. fol. 251. b. which was in 1396; when he deliver'd Letters
of Recommendation to the &s;aid King, from the Earl of <HI>Heynault</HI> and
other Foreign Nobles; and was welcom'd by his Maje&s;ty, <HI>As one who had
been, and is of the Engli&s;h Court,</HI> ib. fol. 252. b. Then he pre&s;ented
the King with a Book, fairly illuminated, which he had engro&s;&s;ed, and bound
in Crim|&s;on Velvet, with Silver Buttons and Cla&s;ps gilt, and golden
Ro&s;es, containing all the Matters of <HI>Amours</HI> and <HI>Moralities,</HI>
which in Four and Twenty Years before, he had compiled, ib. fol. 255. b. &amp;
251. b. One Copy of this Book, fini&s;h'd two Years before, <HI>Pa&s;quier</HI>
&s;aw in the Royal Library at <HI>Fontainbleau,</HI> as Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Bayle</HI> has remark'd. He continued moving about with the Court,
&s;ometimes to <HI>Eltham, King&s;ton,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hene, Wind&s;or,</HI> &amp;c. ib.
fol. 258. And was in this Court more than a Quarter of a Year together; and the
King received him kindly, becau&s;e he was Clerk and Servant in his Youth to
King <HI>Edward</HI> and his Queen. And when he departed out of
<HI>England,</HI> which &s;eems to be the &s;ame Year, King <HI>Richard</HI>
&s;ent him a Goblet of Sil|ver gilt, and in it a Hundred Nobles, ib. fol. 319.
We may pre&s;ume he ended his Life when he left off his Chronicle, from his
expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, upon the Delight he conceived in con|templating the
Merits of his Subject, in the&s;e Words. 
<Q REND="inline">"The which excellent Matter, as long as I
live, by the help of God, I &s;hall continue; for the more I follow and labour
it, the more it plea&s;eth me."</Q> Thus much of the <HI>Hi&s;torian</HI>; as
to his <HI>Tran&s;lator,</HI> with his other Writings and Actions, we refer to
them in <HI>Bale, Dugdale</HI>'s Baronage, and <HI>Wood</HI>'s <HI>Athen.
Oxon.</HI> Now a Word or two of the <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> and we have done.</P> 
<P>And fir&s;t we ob&s;erve, That though the whole
<HI>Chronicle</HI> from the beginning of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. to King
<HI>Henry</HI> IV. pa&s;&s;es currently under the Name of Sir <HI>John
Froi&s;&s;art;</HI> yet that there is a fine old MSS of it in <HI>England,</HI>
beautifully illuminated with Hi&s;torical Figures, particularly of Sir <HI>John
Froi&s;&s;art,</HI> pre&s;enting his Book to the Kings of <HI>England,
France,</HI> &amp;c. which, in the very Title, di&s;tingui&s;hes the Work to
have been begun by <HI>John le Bel,</HI> and continued to the Battle of
<HI>Poictou,</HI> and that then after his Death, it was compiled and fini&s;hed
by the Venerable Sir <HI>John Froi&s;&s;art,</HI> which is agreeable to what he
&s;ays in his Pre|face. So that though <HI>Froi&s;&s;art</HI> might here and
there correct or augment that fir&s;t Part, as he al&s;o intimates; yet what he
com|po&s;ed begins but at the Year 1356. This Ob&s;ervation, with that a|bove
from his own Words, of his not coming &s;o early into <HI>England,</HI> as
&s;ome have &s;ugge&s;ted, who wou'd from his Authority advance the Order of
the Garter up to the Year 1344, may clear him from di&s;agreeing with our
Authentic Records, and antedating the In&s;titution five Years, as Mr.
<HI>A&s;hmole</HI> has objected; the Error, if any there is in the &s;aid
Account, being more probably <HI>John le Bel</HI>'s, and, perhaps, the
Printer's rather than his. But here that we are &s;peaking of MSS, we mu&s;t
not forget one a|mong tho&s;e of <HI>I&s;aac Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> Canon of
<HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> entitled, <HI>L'Hi&s; toire de Froi&s;&s;art, plus ample,
&amp; plus correcte que les Imprimez,</HI> 2 Vol. Folio. From the&s;e, or
others &s;till pre&s;erved both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> it has
been long and much de&s;ir'd, that we might have a more accurate Edition in
<HI>French,</HI> or Tran&s;lation in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> than we have yet had.
'Tis true, the Author him|&s;elf might not be always exact in the naming of
&s;o many Per|&s;ons and Places as he has introduced; &s;eeing he received his
In|telligence from &s;uch Variety of Informers, in &s;uch di&s;tant Parts, and
&s;o much from the <HI>Speech</HI> rather than the <HI>Writings</HI> of Men:
Yet &s;urely his Copies owe little Correction to the Pre&s;s, having undergone
the &s;ame Corruptions, which Books &s;o much treating of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Affairs, have u&s;ually &s;uffer'd by being printed in <HI>France,</HI>
e&s;pecially in the <HI>Names</HI> of Families, Towns and Lord|&s;hips: And Mr.
<HI>Selden</HI> has ob&s;erved in his <HI>Tit.</HI> of <HI>Hon.</HI> p. 635.
That the <HI>Numerals</HI> in <HI>Froi&s;&s;art</HI> are al&s;o lamentably
corrupted and mi&s;printed. Yet whoever will have the Patience to com|pare his
Work, &s;ays Mr. <HI>An&s;tis, Ord.</HI> of the <HI>Gart.</HI> Vol. II. p. 98.
with the Coaevous Records publi&s;h'd by Mr. <HI>Rymer,</HI> will from that
E&s;&s;ay only, be &s;o far &s;atisfied of his Integrity, as may induce him
pa&s;&s;ionately to wi&s;h for a New Correct Edition: And if this Author has
not hitherto received the Honour of being printed at the <HI>Louvre</HI> with
&s;ome other Hi&s;torians, according to the Propo&s;al of the learned
Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Fre&s;ne,</HI> in <HI>Le Long, Bibl. Hi&s;t.</HI> p. 235.
upon the National Motive of prai&s;ing his own Country too little, and ours too
much, &s;ee <HI>La Popeliniere, Hi&s;t. des Hi&s;t.</HI> lib. 8. and <HI>Bodin
Meth. Hi&s;t.</HI> c. 4. The&s;e Rea&s;ons, with the extraordinary Dearne&s;s
of the printed Copies, &s;hould excite &s;ome learned Per&s;on of this Kingdom,
for the Reputation of our own Country, to collate the MS Copies, compare the
Facts with Records, and contemporary Writers, and correct the mi&s;era|ble
Mi&s;-&s;pellings, in the &s;everal Impre&s;&s;ions, of their Surnames, who
abundantly &s;ignaliz'd their Valour, in Ju&s;tice to the Merits of the&s;e
celebrated Per&s;ons, and in Honour to their Po&s;terity. The mo&s;t Ancient of
the&s;e <HI>Impre&s;&s;ions</HI> in <HI>French,</HI> &s;eems to be that printed
by <HI>Ant. Verard</HI> a Book&s;eller of <HI>Paris, Folio,</HI> with|out Date.
The next was that printed al&s;o at <HI>Paris</HI> by three &s;everal
Per&s;ons, that is, The fir&s;t Volume by <HI>Fra. Regnauld,</HI> the &s;econd
and third by <HI>Michael le Noir,</HI> 1505. The fourth by <HI>John Petit,</HI>
1518. The Copy of which Edition, now before us, bound in Two Tomes, Folio, has
the Arms of many of the Nobility, mentioned therein, drawn with a Pen in the
Margin. There was another Impre&s;&s;ion at <HI>Paris,</HI> by <HI>Ant.
Couteau,</HI> al&s;o bound in Two Volumes Fol. 1530. This was that chiefly
u&s;ed by <HI>Denis Sauvage,</HI> Hi&s;toriographer to King <HI>Henry</HI> II.
of <HI>France,</HI> in the Edition he revi&s;ed and corrected from many Copies
and Abridgments; which was printed at <HI>Lyons,</HI> by <HI>John de
Tournes,</HI> Fol. 1559. and again, at <HI>Paris,</HI> in <HI>Folio</HI> 1574.
with Marginal Re|marks, and Annotations at the End of every Book. He finds
fault with the preceding Editors, &s;everal Parts of whom he may have rightly
corrected, but is him&s;elf liable in many Places to Cor|rection;
notwith&s;tanding he has been &s;o preferr'd, that a Copy of his Edition, has
been &s;ometimes &s;old in <HI>England</HI> for <HI>Ten Guineas.</HI> We cou'd
wi&s;h that mo&s;t of the Errors in the&s;e <HI>French</HI> Editions, were as
truly corrected in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> one, as Bi&s;hop <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI>
imagin'd they were. In three of the Editions we have &s;een, neither the Books
nor the Chapters are divided alike; &s;o that it is very tedious and
confu&s;ing to find, in one of them, the References of the other. Though
<HI>Froi&s;&s;art</HI>'s Method is &s;ome|what diffu&s;e and interrupted, yet
the Epitome we have of him in Print, is &s;carce worth mentioning, however
drawn up by <HI>Slei|dan,</HI> &s;uch a Skeleton he has made of it, 12^o
<HI>Franc.</HI> 1584, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and with &s;uch Partiality, to the
prejudice of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> has he &s;o dimini&s;h'd it; according to
the Cen&s;ure of our Learned <HI>Humphrey Lhuid in Comment. Brit.
De&s;crip.</HI> fol. 27. And yet it has been tran&s;lated into
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by <HI>P. Golding,</HI> and printed in a Quarto Pamphlet
1608. But, we &s;hall now leave it, with our Wi&s;hes of better Treatment, in

who has nothing of his own intermix'd, but only diligently collects and
impartially records all Things without Choice or Prejudice, leaving intirely to

Year 1546, and the Second Part, in 1550, as appears in his Conclu&s;ions of

the Year before he was made Bi&s;hop of <HI>O&s;&s;ory.</HI> In this Edition
was pro|bably publi&s;h'd the Author's <HI>Dedication</HI> to King

already publi&s;h'd do, and what tho&s;e to be publi&s;h'd were to treat of,
are as follows. 
<Q REND="inline">"How the great Adver&s;ary of God,

hope is, that the <HI>Two Lattre Partes</HI> which will, God wil|ling, mo&s;t
&s;pedily follow, &s;hal declare it yet much more at large. I have therein
decreed, for difference of the Bookes; and apt Arguments of the Matters
contained in them, to give them Four &s;everal Titles; of <HI>Ri&s;ing,
Building, Holding</HI> and <HI>Falling.</HI> For the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Part

the hipocriti&s;he Monks to e&s;tabli&s;h the wicked Kingdom of Antichri&s;te:

&s;carcely now to be recover'd in Manu|&s;cript. The Book in the whole may be
u&s;eful upon many <PB N="86" REF="113"> Occa&s;ions; tho' to be read with
&s;ome Grains of Allowance; the Zeal of its Author's Mind for the Reformation
requi|ring, &s;ometimes, it&s;elf, perhaps to be reform'd, for making him a
little too violent in his Sentiments, and gro&s;s in his Language.</P>

<HI>Ver&s;e. By</HI> WILLIAM WEBBE <HI>Graduate. Imprinted at</HI> London
<HI>by</HI> John Charlewood. Quarto, 1586.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THE Author of this very &s;carce Pamphlet, con&s;i&s;ting of five
Sheets and a half, <HI>dedicates</HI> it to <HI>Edward Suliard</HI>
<ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who&s;e Sons were under his Tuition, and who had been
pre&s;ented by him with &s;ome other Work before, which was a Tran&s;lation of
&s;ome Poetry belike, from, or into <HI>Latin.</HI> In his <HI>Preface,</HI> To
the <HI>Noble Poets of England,</HI> he ob&s;erves, that tho' <HI>Books</HI>
of, or tending to Poetry were, then, more numerous than any other
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Books, yet that 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Poetry</HI> has found fewe&s;t Friends to
amend it; tho&s;e who can, re|&s;erving their Skill to them&s;elves; tho&s;e
who cannot, run|ning headlong upon it; thinking to garni&s;h it with their
Devi&s;es, but more corrupting it with fanta&s;tical Errors."</Q> Therefore the
chief end of his Writing this <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> is, to propo&s;e a
<HI>Reformation</HI> of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poetry, 
<Q REND="inline">"by having &s;ome perfect Platform, or
<HI>Pro&s;odia</HI> of <HI>ver&s;ifying</HI> ratified; either in Imitation of
the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latins,</HI> or, where it would not well abide the
touch of their Rules, thro' the like Ob&s;ervations, &s;elected and
e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the natural Af|fectation of the Speech<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But this Project, tho' we find it was propo&s;ed and attempted by
other prime Wits of the&s;e Times before, &s;uch as Sir <HI>Philip Sidney,</HI>
Sir <HI>Edward Dyer, Spen&s;er,</HI> Dr. <HI>Gabriel Harvey,</HI> and o|thers,
not &s;ucceeding; our end of reviving here, or reviewing this
<HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> is chiefly for the &s;ake of tho&s;e Characters, which
our Author has given in it, of the antient, and more e&s;pecially the
<HI>Engli&s;h Poets,</HI> from <HI>Chaucer</HI> and <HI>Gower,</HI> down to the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable of tho&s;e who flouri&s;h'd at the Time of this
Publica|tion; that the critical Reader may better know, whether the O|pinions
held of them in tho&s;e Days, and ours, corre&s;pond; and better judge, from
the Conclu&s;ions we form upon the Writings of our Ance&s;tors, what liberty
Po&s;terity will take with our own.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="114">In the <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> having
&s;poken in general of Poetry, what it is, whence it had its beginning, and in
what e&s;teem it has always been, according to <HI>Plato, Ari&s;totle,</HI> and
<HI>Spen|&s;er</HI> in his <HI>Shepherd's Calendar,</HI> which our Author
thinks in|ferior neither to <HI>Theocritus</HI> nor <HI>Virgil,</HI> and
therefore zea|lou&s;ly wi&s;hes for his other Works abroad, e&s;pecially his
<HI>Engli&s;h Poet,</HI> which his Friend <HI>E. K.</HI> did once promi&s;e to
publi&s;h; he then &s;hews the Opinion that was held of the Power of Poetry;
how <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Scipio</HI> were delighted with it. So proceeds
to enumerate the mo&s;t memorable Poets among the Ancients, as <HI>Orpheus,
Amphion, Tyrtaeus, Homer, Ennius,</HI> and <HI>Empedocles</HI>; with the
<HI>Comic, Tragic,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;toral</HI> Poets among the
<HI>Grecians</HI>; and in like manner the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets; more
particularly of <HI>Virgil</HI>; then of the <HI>Epi|grammatic, Elegiac,</HI>
and <HI>Hi&s;torical</HI> Poets. Of <HI>Ovid, Horace,</HI> be&s;ides many
others, and al&s;o, as not inferior to &s;ome of them, <HI>Palengenius,
Mantuan,</HI> and, for a &s;ingular Gift in a &s;weet Heroical Ver&s;e, matches
with them, <HI>Chri&s;topher Oc|land,</HI> the Author of our <HI>Anglorum
Praelia.</HI></P>
<P>Hence he de&s;cends to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets: And here
ob|&s;erves, that he knows of no memorable Work written by any Poet in
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> till twenty Years pa&s;t; tho' Learning was not generally
decay'd at any time, e&s;pecially &s;ince <HI>Wil|liam the Conqueror</HI>; as
may appear by many famous Works written by Bi&s;hops and others; yet that
Poetry was then in little Account, the Light of the old <HI>Greek</HI> and
<HI>Latin</HI> Poets which they had, being contemn'd by them, as appears by
their rude ver&s;ifying, wherein they thought nothing to be learnedly written
in Ver&s;e, which fell not out in Rhyme, either by the middle Words of each
Ver&s;e &s;ounding alike with the la&s;t, or every two Ver&s;es ending with the
like Let|ters. The Original of which tinkling Ver&s;e is a&s;crib'd by Mr.
<HI>A&s;cham</HI> to the <HI>Hunns</HI> and <HI>Goths.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI>
I. &s;ur|nam'd <HI>Beauclerk,</HI> is here next &s;poken of, his Name being a
Proof that Learning in this Country was not little e&s;teem'd of at that rude
Time; and that among other Studies it is probable &s;uch a Prince would not
neglect the Faculty of Poetry. But the fir&s;t of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets
here mention'd is <HI>John Gower</HI> in the Time of King <HI>Richard</HI> II.
a &s;ingular well learned Man, who&s;e Works our Author wi&s;hes were all 
<PB N="88" REF="115" MS="y"> whole and perfect among us, as containing much
deep Knowledge and Delight. <HI>Chaucer</HI> the God of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Poets, next after, if not equal in Time, hath left many Works both for Delight
and profitable Knowledge, far exceeding any other that as yet, ever &s;ince his
Time, directed their Studies that way. Tho' his Stile may now &s;eem blunt and
coar&s;e, yet in him may be &s;een the perfect Shape of a right Poet. By his
delight&s;ome Vein he &s;o gull'd the Ears of Men with his Devices, that tho'
Corruption bore &s;uch a &s;way that Learning and Truth could &s;carce &s;hew
them&s;elves, yet without Controll might he gird at the Vices and Abu&s;es of
all States, and gall them with very &s;harp and eager Inventions; which he did
&s;o learnedly and plea&s;antly, that none therefore would call him in
que&s;tion, <HI>&amp;c. Lydgate,</HI> for good Pro|portion of his Ver&s;e and
meetly current Stile, as the Time afforded, is by our Author thought &s;urely
comparable with <HI>Chaucer,</HI> yet more occupied in &s;uper&s;titious and
odd Mat|ters than was requi&s;ite in &s;o good a Wit; which though he handled
them commendably, yet the Matters them&s;elves be|ing not &s;o commendable, his
E&s;teem has been the le&s;s. The next of our antient Poets he &s;uppo&s;es to
be <HI>Pierce Ploughman,</HI> who is &s;omewhat har&s;h and ob&s;cure, but
indeed a very pithy Writer, and the fir&s;t our Author had &s;een who
ob&s;erv'd the Quantity of our Ver&s;e without the Curio&s;ity of Rhyme. Then
he comes to <HI>Skelton</HI> in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who as he
obtain'd the Laurel-Garland is, with good right, granted the Title of a Poet,
being a plea&s;ant conceited Fellow, and of a very &s;harp Wit, exceeding bold,
and would nip to the very quick where he once &s;et hold. After him is
mention'd Ma&s;ter <HI>George Gaskoyne,</HI> as painful a Soldier in the
Affairs of his Prince and Country as he was a witty Poet in his Writing; in
who&s;e farther Commendation, he cites the Words of <HI>E. K.</HI> upon the
ninth <HI>Eclogue</HI> of the <HI>new Poet.</HI> Here he pa&s;&s;es over
divers, as the old Earl of <HI>Surrey,</HI> the Lord <HI>Vaux, Norton,
Bri&s;tow, Edwards, Tu&s;&s;er, Churchyard, W. Hunnis, Haiwood, Sand, Hyll, S.
Y. M. D.</HI> becau&s;e they would make his Di&s;cour&s;e too tedious. But
ob&s;erves, that the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> may challenge to him&s;elf the
Title of the mo&s;t excellent, among the re&s;t of the Lords and Gentlemen in
her Maje&s;ty's Court. Hence he proceeds to the Tran&s;|lators; among whom he
&s;hall ever account Dr. <HI>Phaer</HI> the be&s;t, for his <HI>Virgil,</HI> as
far as half the tenth Book of the <HI>Ae|neids,</HI> the re&s;t being no le&s;s
commendably fini&s;h'd by that worthy Scholar and famous Phy&s;ician <HI>T.
Twyne:</HI> Equal with <PB N="89" REF="116" MS="y"> him he joins <HI>Arthur
Golding,</HI> for his Labour in <HI>Ovid's Me|tamorpho&s;es,</HI> who, for his
further profiting this Nation and Speech in all good Learning, is here greatly
extoll'd. The next Place is given to <HI>Barnaby Googe,</HI> be&s;ides his own
Com|po&s;itions, for his Tran&s;lation of <HI>Palengenius his Zodiac</HI>; and
he is follow'd by <HI>Abraham Flemming,</HI> with whom he would join another of
his Name, who had excell'd as well in all kinds of Learning as in Poetry
e&s;pecially, were his Inven|tions made publick. Here he apologizes for not
being par|ticular on the Tran&s;lators of <HI>Seneca, Ovid, Horace,
Man|tuan,</HI> and many others; al&s;o the Students of the Univer&s;i|ties and
Inns of Court, becau&s;e he has not &s;een all he has heard of, nor dwells in a
Place where he can ea&s;ily get knowledge of their Works. One however he may
not o|ver-&s;lip, and that is Ma&s;ter <HI>George Whet&s;tone,</HI> a Man
&s;ingu|larly well skill'd in this Faculty of Poetry. To him is join'd
<HI>Anthony Munday,</HI> an earne&s;t Traveller in this Art, in who&s;e Name
our Author had &s;een very excellent Works, e&s;pecially upon Nymphs and
Shepherds, well worthy to be view'd, and to be e&s;teem'd as very rare Poetry.
With the&s;e he places <HI>John Graunge, Knyght, Wylmot, Darrel, F. C. F.
K.</HI> and <HI>G. B.</HI> But here, has re&s;erv'd a Place purpo&s;ely for
one, who if not only, yet principally de&s;erves the Title of the righte&s;t
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poet that ever our Author read, that is, the Author of the
<HI>Shepherd's Kalendar.</HI> And finds none fit to couple with him, unle&s;s
<HI>Gabriel Harvey,</HI> for his much admir'd <HI>Latin</HI> Poetry, his
Reformation of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;e, and beautifying the &s;ame with
brave Devices, tho' chiefly hidden in hateful Ob&s;curity, and the Author long
&s;ince occupied in graver Studies. And if he were to join <HI>Harvey</HI>'s
two Bro|thers, the one a Divine, the other a Phy&s;ician, is a&s;&s;ur'd, they
would much adorn the Art, if they would &s;et their hands to it.</P>
<P>After his Judgment of the <HI>Poets,</HI> he &s;peaks of the
<HI>Engli&s;h Poetry</HI> in its Matter and Form; what <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> is, the
Argu|ments of primitive Poetry, the Comic, Tragic, and Hi&s;to|ric; the U&s;e
and End of Poetry from the Te&s;timony of <HI>Horace.</HI> With his Advice, of

ob&s;erv'd by <HI>Chaucer.</HI> Others of <HI>Horace</HI> his Rules, with the
Tran&s;lation of Sir <HI>Thomas Elyot</HI> of Reading la&s;civious Poems, and

Examples to this purpo&s;e, from <HI>Plautus, Terence, O|vid,</HI> and

<PB N="90" REF="117" MS="y"> that we have nothing an&s;werable to
<HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> im|puted to our not having had a timely
regard to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Speech, and curious handling of our Ver&s;e,
tho' now it has had great Advantages of Eloquence from &s;ome rare and
&s;in|gular Wits; among whom, that Ma&s;ter <HI>John Lilly</HI> has de|&s;erved
mo&s;t high Commendations, as one who has &s;tep'd further therein than any
before, or &s;ince he fir&s;t began the witty Di&s;cour&s;e of his
<HI>Euphues.</HI> Who&s;e Works &s;urely in re|&s;pect of his &s;ingular
Eloquence, and brave Compo&s;ition of apt Words and Sentences, let the learned
examine and make Trial thereof thro' all the Parts of Rhetoric in fit
Phra&s;es, in pithy Sentences, in gallant Tropes, in flowing Speech, in plain
Sen&s;e; and &s;urely, in my Judgment, I think he will yield him that Verdict
which <HI>Quintilian</HI> gives of both the be&s;t Orators,
<HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> and <HI>Tully:</HI> That from the one nothing may be
taken away; to the other, nothing may be added: But for a clo&s;er Example, to
prove a former A&s;&s;ertion, of the Fitne&s;s of our Language to receive the
be&s;t Form of Poetry, we are referr'd to the Examination of Dr.
<HI>Phaer</HI>'s Tran&s;lation of <HI>Virgil</HI> with the Original, from both
which, here are &s;everal Examples laid before us, and our Critick thinks, that
the like Inference might be drawn from the Com|pari&s;on of <HI>Ovid</HI>'s
<HI>Metamorpho&s;is,</HI> with <HI>Golding</HI>'s Tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>Next our Author treats more particularly of the Pa&s;toral Poetry
or Eclogue: Here having &s;poken of <HI>Theocritus, Vir|gil,</HI> and others,
he comes to one of our own Country, com|parable with the be&s;t in any
Re&s;pect, even Ma&s;ter <HI>Spen&s;er,</HI> Author of the <HI>Shepherd</HI>'s
<HI>Calendar,</HI> who wou'd, he thinks, have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them, if the
Coar&s;ene&s;s of our Speech (that is, the Cour&s;e of Cu&s;tom which he wou'd
not infringe) had been no greater Impediment to him, than their pure Native
Tongues were to them. Here we have a little Compari&s;on between
<HI>Virgil</HI>'s Eclogues and <HI>Spen&s;er</HI>'s, and the Commen|dations of
<HI>E. K.</HI> upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poet. The &s;ubject Mat|ter, and
u&s;e of his &s;aid Calendar, and our Author's Apology for what had been
objected again&s;t &s;omething in his &s;ixth Eclogue, &s;hewing it is the
fooli&s;h Con&s;truction, and not his Writing that is blameable. To the&s;e
Writers of Pa&s;torals, are join'd tho&s;e who wrote Precepts of Husbandry in
Ver&s;e, after the manner of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Georgics</HI>; &s;uch as
that Book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">f <HI>Tu&s;&s;er,</HI> a
Piece &s;urely, &s;ays he, of great Wit and Experience, and withal very
prettily handled. And he thinks that this Argument has been &s;o little treated
of in Poetry, becau&s;e &s;o many have written of it in Pro&s;e. As for a
Tran&s;lation of <PB N="91" REF="118" MS="y"> the <HI>Georgics,</HI> it appears
that <HI>Abr. Flemming</HI> in his Ver&s;ion of the Eclogues, did make &s;ome
Promi&s;e thereof, and that our Author <HI>Webbe</HI> did perform the like; but
it &s;eems not that either of their Works were printed. Thence, from the
Subject of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Writers, he pa&s;&s;es to the Form and Manner
of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;e; cen&s;ures our barbarous prac|tice of
Rhyming; what is under&s;tood by Rhyme, and how improperly that Word is
apply'd. The fir&s;t beginning of Rhyme. Rules to be ob&s;erved in framing our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Rhyme. Next we come to the &s;everal kinds of
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;e, differing in Number of Syllables, where 'tis
ob&s;erv'd the longe&s;t Ver&s;e in length, our Author has &s;een u&s;ed in
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ixteen Syllables, not much u&s;ed, and
commonly divided, each Ver&s;e equally into two, rhiming alternately. The next
in length is of fourteen Syllables, the mo&s;t u&s;ual of all others, among
Tran&s;lators of the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets, which al&s;o often is divided into
two Lines; the fir&s;t of eight Syllables, the &s;econd of &s;ix, whereof the
&s;ixes always rhime, and &s;ometimes the others. But to avoid Tediou&s;ne&s;s
and Confu&s;ion, repeats only the different &s;orts of Ver&s;es in the
<HI>Shepherd</HI>'s <HI>Calendar,</HI> which contains twelve or thirteen
&s;everal &s;orts, differing in Length, or Rhime, or Di&s;tinc|tion of the
Staves. After the&s;e Examples we have &s;ome Remarks, on the natural Order of
Words, or <HI>Po&s;ition</HI> in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poetry, and that the
quantity of our old Ver&s;e of fourteen Syllables, runs much upon the
<HI>Iambic:</HI> With further Ob&s;ervations upon Rhime. <HI>Gaskoyne</HI>'s
In&s;tructions for ver&s;ifying. Of &s;ome rare Devices and pretty Inventions
in Compo&s;ition, as in the Song of <HI>Colin,</HI> &s;ung by <HI>Cuddy</HI> in
the <HI>Shepherd</HI>'s <HI>Calendar,</HI> framed upon &s;ix Words, prettily
turn'd and wound up together. Not unlike <HI>John Graunge</HI>'s Device of
making the la&s;t Words of a certain Number of Ver&s;es fall into Sen&s;e: And
that there were &s;everal delicate Performances in this Nature of
<HI>Echoes,</HI> privately pa&s;&s;ing a|mong the fine&s;t Poets of our
Author's Time. We have &s;omething al&s;o after the manner of the Acro&s;tic,
from the Compo&s;itions of <HI>W. Hunnis.</HI> Then he proceeds to the
re|formed kind of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;e, in Imitation of the
<HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latins,</HI> which many had attempted to put in
Practice, and this Part takes up three Leaves, in which among other Things, he
ob&s;erves the Hexameter to be the mo&s;t famous Ver&s;e; and that the fir&s;t
who attempted to practi&s;e it in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> was the Earl of
<HI>Surrey,</HI> who tran&s;lated &s;ome part of <HI>Virgil</HI> into Ver&s;e;
but without regard of true quantity of <PB N="92" REF="119" MS="y"> Syllables.
Here he repeats the famous Di&s;tich in <HI>Hexame|ter,</HI> common in the
mouths of all Men, which was made by Ma&s;ter <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI> Fellow of St.
<HI>John</HI>'s College in <HI>Cam|bridge,</HI> about forty Years pa&s;t; and
two more in the Glo&s;s of <HI>E. K.</HI> upon the fifth Eclogue of the new
Poet: That the great Number of the like kind made by Mr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> were
not unknown to any, and his own Tran&s;lation of the two fir&s;t Eclogues of
<HI>Virgil</HI> in the like &s;ort of Ver&s;e, is by our Author here exhibited.
After which Examples in <HI>Hexameter,</HI> he comes to the <HI>Elegiac</HI>
Ver&s;e with Examples, and la&s;tly, in like manner of the <HI>Sapphic,</HI>
with an Example thereof in his Ver&s;ion, from the fourth <HI>Eclogue</HI> in
the <HI>Shep|herd</HI>'s <HI>Calendar,</HI> of <HI>Colin</HI>'s Song, &s;ung by
<HI>Hobbinol</HI> in prai&s;e of the Queen. To the whole is annexed, The
<HI>Canons</HI> or <HI>Ge|neral Cautions of Poetry,</HI> pre&s;cribed by
<HI>Horace,</HI> fir&s;t gather'd by <HI>Geo. Fabricius Cremnicen&s;is</HI>;
and at the End, a &s;hort <HI>Epi|logue,</HI> in which for the rendering our
Poetry equal with the be&s;t in other Tongues, he gives us hopes of framing
&s;ome apt <HI>Engli&s;h Pro&s;odia</HI>; but hopes fir&s;t to enjoy the
Benefit of &s;ome others Judgment, who&s;e Authority may bear greater Credit,
and who&s;e Learning can better perform it.</P>

<P>THIS little Work was written in An&s;wer to a Treati&s;e newly
publi&s;hed, entitled <HI>Free Trade, or the Means to make Trade
flouri&s;h;</HI> wherein, its Author had omitted to han|dle the predominant
part, namely, the My&s;tery of <HI>Exchange</HI> between us and other Nations;
his only Scope being to have the Moneys of the Kingdom enhanced in Price, and
the Fo|reign Coins, inconveniently, made current in the Realm at high Rates:
And becau&s;e the &s;aid Treati&s;e was publi&s;h'd at the Time when King
<HI>James</HI> had referr'd the con&s;ideration of this important Bu&s;ine&s;s
to <HI>Henry</HI> Vi&s;count <HI>Mandeville,</HI> Lord Pre&s;ident of the Privy

Author Mr. <HI>Malynes</HI> was call'd, and did certify his Opinion; he,
therefore, dedicates this <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>In his &s;aid Dedication, he lays down, <HI>Traffic</HI> to be the
<HI>Preheminent Study of Princes,</HI> becau&s;e the Sacred Wi&s;dom has
approved this <HI>Axiom:</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"That a <HI>King</HI> is mi&s;erable, how
<HI>rich</HI> &s;oever he be, if he reigns over a <HI>poor</HI> People; and
that a <HI>Kingdom</HI> is not able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, how rich &s;oever the
<HI>People</HI> be, if the <HI>King</HI> be not able to maintain his
E&s;tate."</Q> He concludes with ob&s;erving that, <HI>Worthy</HI> of
Commenda|tion are tho&s;e, who can, by Providence, <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> the
Trea|&s;ure of Kings and Commonwealths; <HI>worthier</HI> are tho&s;e, who
both, by hone&s;t and lawful Means, can <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> and
<HI>augment</HI> them; but <HI>worthie&s;t</HI> of all Immortal Prai&s;e are
tho&s;e, who can, and do, by ea&s;y, ju&s;t and politic Means, <HI>inrich</HI>
Kingdoms and Commonwealths, and thereby fill the Prince's Coffers with
&s;tanding Trea&s;ure, to &s;erve in Time of War, when Arms are nece&s;&s;ary,
and the Time of Peace, more fitting whole&s;ome Laws. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the <HI>Theorick</HI> Part of which Study, I

ingenious Author of this &s;carce and cu|rious Tract, who thus &s;pent Forty
Years in the Study of Means to enrich his Country by Traffic, was a Per&s;on of
&s;uch con&s;ide|rable Note for his Abilities, that he was often called to the
Coun|cil Table, both in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, and King
<HI>James</HI>'s, for his Opinion in <HI>Mercantile</HI> Affairs. He was
appointed one of the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade</HI> in the <HI>Low
Countries,</HI> for &s;ettling the Value of Monies about the Year 1586. He was
afterwards a Commi&s;&s;ioner al&s;o at Home in the Year 1600, for
e&s;tabli&s;hing the true <HI>Par of Exchange</HI>; and upon the Laws, enacted
in the fourth Year of King <HI>James,</HI> for the making of good and true
Cloth, he exhibited a <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> to the Lords of the Privy
Council, &s;hewing the <HI>Weight, Length</HI> and <HI>Bredth</HI> of all
&s;orts of <HI>Cloths</HI>; and that <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI> do
controul each other; whereby the Merchant, who buys the Cloth, may be enabled
to find out the Fraud and Deceit of the Clothier: We find al&s;o that he
publi&s;h'd &s;everal other Books, be&s;ides this above ab&s;tracted; as, near
Thirty Years before it, <HI>The Canker of England's Com|monwealth</HI>; al&s;o
<HI>England's View</HI>; and that he now had under the Pre&s;s, a Volume
entitled <HI>Lex Mercatoria,</HI> or <HI>The Ancient Law Merchant,</HI> wherein
the dangerous Rocks to be avoided in the Cour&s;e of Traffic, and the Means
thereunto con|ducing, are manife&s;ted, for the Pre&s;ervation and Augmentation
of the Wealth of the&s;e Kingdoms, according to <HI>Jus Gentium</HI>; the
Knowledge whereof is of &s;uch Moment, that all other Tem|poral Laws, without
it are not complete. He writ al&s;o, <HI>The Royal Merchant of Great
Britain,</HI> which he had now in MS. and, perhaps, others, which we have not
lei&s;ure at pre&s;ent to en|quire after.</NOTE></P>
<P>In his preliminiary Di&s;cour&s;e, he di&s;tingui&s;hes the
<HI>Three.</HI> E&s;&s;ential Parts of Traffic, namely, <HI>Commodities,
Money</HI> and <HI>Exchange,</HI> to be, the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> as the
<HI>Body,</HI> which upheld the World by Commutation and Bartering, till Money
was de|vi&s;ed; the <HI>Second,</HI> as the <HI>Soul</HI> in the Body,
infu&s;ing Life to Traffic, by the Means of Equality and Equity; the
<HI>Third,</HI> as the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Faculty</HI> of the
<HI>Soul,</HI> being &s;eated every where, corroborating the vital Spirit of
Traffic, and di|recting or controlling, by ju&s;t Proportions, the Prices and
Values of Commodites and Moneys. A little further, he <PB N="98" REF="125">
tells an Ingenious Tale, which he applies to the Force of Exchange by
inferring, That the Author of the <HI>Treati&s;e of Free Trade,</HI> is like
the Novices mention'd in that Tale, who perceiving two great Whales to have
a&s;&s;aulted the <HI>Engli&s;h Ship of Traffic</HI>; the one being the
<HI>Wars</HI> in <HI>Chri&s;tendome,</HI> and the Pirates, and the other, more
gentle, being the <HI>Policy</HI> of Princes and States, hath publi&s;h'd the
<HI>Cau&s;es</HI> of the <HI>Decay of Trade</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and the
Means to make the &s;ame flou|ri&s;h, without ob&s;erving the operative Power
of <HI>Exchange,</HI> which is the <HI>Rudder</HI> of the <HI>Ship of
Traffic,</HI> fa&s;tned to the <HI>Rule</HI> of the <HI>Equality</HI> of
<HI>Moneys,</HI> according to their Weight and Finene&s;s.</P>
<P>The Treati&s;e it&s;elf containing many ob&s;ervable Particu|lars
is divided into five Chapters; the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> whereof, is on, <HI>The
Cau&s;es of the want of Moneys in England.</HI> This Chap|ter begins with
&s;ome Remarks on the Undervaluation of Money in Exchange, with an In&s;tance
of the Value of <HI>Realls,</HI> and the <HI>Par of Exchange</HI>; when
<HI>Dudley</HI> Earl of <HI>Lei|ce&s;ter</HI> went Governour of the Low
Countries in 1586. Whence it is concluded, That, if the Low Exchange were not,
the Gain wou'd prove to be imaginary; that when the Exchange an&s;wers the true
Value of our Moneys, they are never exported, becau&s;e the <HI>Gain</HI> is
an&s;wered by Exchange, which is the Cau&s;e of Tran&s;portation; &s;o that
Exchange is &s;till predominant, and &s;trikes the &s;troke; and tho' the Price
ri&s;es and falls according to the plenty or &s;carcity of Money, yet Moneys
are over-ruled thereby: for if you enhance the Coin, the Exchange controlls it,
and ri&s;es accordingly; if you un|dervalue it, the Exchange in like manner
falls, to the end that the Value thereof &s;hou'd be an&s;wer'd by the public
Mea|&s;ure, and to prevent all Abu&s;es in the Price of Commodities, and
Valuation of Moneys either Real or Imaginary, according to the Cu&s;tom of the
Place, by device of the Bankers. That this was &s;eriou&s;ly ob&s;erved in
1576, by the Lord Keeper <HI>Bacon,</HI> Lord Trea&s;urer <HI>Burghley,</HI>
Secretary <HI>Wal&s;ingham,</HI> with other Coun&s;ellors of State, be&s;ides
many Per&s;ons of Experience, as Sir <HI>Thomas Gre&s;ham, Richard Martin,</HI>
Ma|&s;ter of the Mint, and many more here named; who found that the Bankers or
Exchangers for their private Gain, had brought in Twenty Inconveniencies, which
are here parti|culariz'd: By which it may be &s;een, &s;ays our Author, of what
Importance the Operation of Exchange is, and where|in the Endeavours of Sir
<HI>Thomas Gre&s;ham,</HI> thinking to rule the Exchange of <HI>England,</HI>
by plenty of Money, prov'd fruit|le&s;s, <PB N="99" REF="126"> which might have
been performed with more facility by Direction. Here we have Foreign Examples
from <HI>Bo|din,</HI> of Bankers having their Goods confi&s;cated, and being
indicted as Cozeners, &s;eeing that in a &s;hort time with 24000 Pounds, they
had gotten 2400000. This is apply'd to the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and in
what Ca&s;e it wou'd have been more &s;en&s;ible of the like Lo&s;s; &s;ince,
tho' Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Coffers were &s;tored with &s;even hundred
thou|&s;and Pounds Sterling, before the Wars with the Earl of <HI>Ty|rone</HI>
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> more than double that Sum had been &s;pent therein.
<HI>The Second Cau&s;e of our Want of Money,</HI> is next imputed to the
&s;uperfluity of <HI>Plate</HI> in private Hands. Under this Head, is
ob&s;erved the great Quantity of Silver con|&s;umed in Silver Thread, Spangles,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon late Examina|tion found, to amount to above four&s;core
thou&s;ands Pounds yearly; whereas the Plate made in <HI>London,</HI> is only
fifty or &s;ixty thou&s;and Pounds worth. Here we have the &s;everal Opinions
given to <HI>Charles</HI> IX. of <HI>France,</HI> upon his want of Money, after
the <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> Ma&s;&s;acre; &s;ome, under colour of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing
Pride, advi&s;ing him to pre&s;cribe every Man what &s;tore he &s;hou'd keep,
and melt down the re&s;t. Others, that he wou'd imba&s;e his Money under the
Standard of Plate, &s;o bring Plate to be turn'd into Money. This is follow'd
by another Example, in our <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who priviledg'd his Nobles to
make ba&s;e Money of their own Plate, which fell
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ut to the prejudice of the
Commonwealth, and was but a &s;hift for the Time to him&s;elf. Then we have a
more par|ticular Account of Gold and Silver Thread, both as to what the Author
had recommended in his <HI>England</HI>'s <HI>View,</HI> about making it at
home, and the Rea&s;ons why, by late Procla|mation, the Foreign Manufacture
thereof was encouraged. <HI>The Third Cau&s;e of our want of Money,</HI> is
a&s;crib'd to the Con|&s;umption of Foreign Commodities, or the buying them,
pro|portionably, dearer than we &s;ell our own, which he has proved (in his
<HI>Canker</HI> of <HI>England</HI>) to proceed from the A|bu&s;e of Exchange.
Here we have the Cau&s;es of the over|ballancing of Commodities, and the
Effects by which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants are bereaved of two
e&s;&s;ential Parts of Trade in three. And here we &s;ee the Advantages which
Foreign Trade has over ours, and how our Commodities are fallen in Price; that
<HI>French</HI> Wines are dearer to us, by the Money of the Realm's being
undervalued in Ex|change; and that the le&s;s Sterling Money we reckon in
Ex|change with them, the more is the gain of our Commodities. 
<PB N="100" REF="127"> <HI>The Fourth Cau&s;e is the Want of Money,</HI>
(according to the <HI>Treati&s;e</HI> our Author an&s;wers, for the&s;e
Cau&s;es he takes from thence) is the great Want of our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Stock at home; but our Author expected the ready Money &s;ent in <HI>Reals</HI>
of Plate to be imploy'd in the &s;aid Trade, wou'd rather have been mention'd,
not but he thinks this <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, which began with us in
<HI>England,</HI> immediately after the great Jubilee Year 1600, might be very
profitable hereafter. He gives us an In&s;tance in <HI>Pepper</HI>; which, if
it co&s;t but Two-pence half-penny the Pound in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and Ten
Shillings employ'd therein, will require but 35 Shillings for all Charges to
deliver it in <HI>London,</HI> where it is u&s;ually &s;old for above
Twenty-pence; it follows there mu&s;t be great Gain, which will encrea&s;e when
the Parties &s;hall be united in true Love: Whereas the Lo&s;s we &s;uffer by
the undervaluing of our Mo|ney in Exchange, yearly, is greater than all the
Moneys em|ploy'd yearly for the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI>; wherefore he is for
encou|raging this Trade, and the rather for that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> found
Rea&s;ons, which are here produced, for continuing the &s;ame. Here we have
al&s;o &s;ome Ob&s;ervations upon our Riches, &s;ince the Di&s;covery of the
<HI>We&s;t-Indies. The Fifth Cau&s;e of our Want of Money,</HI> imputed to the
Wars of <HI>Chri&s;|tendom</HI> cau&s;ing Exportation, and the <HI>Pirates</HI>
hindring Impor|tation of Money, is next examin'd. Here our Author argues, that
if the <HI>Pirates</HI> did not take &s;ome of our Money, it fol|lows not that
the &s;ame wou'd come to us in <HI>Specie</HI>; and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the Exportation by Wars, he an&s;wers to the
Argument, that the <HI>Rix-Dollar</HI> being rai&s;ed in many Places of
<HI>Germany,</HI> &s;hou'd draw abundance of Money into the Mints of tho&s;e
Countries, that Money inhanced is never carried to the Mint, but runs away like
Po&s;t-hor&s;es, every Man fearing to lo&s;e by the Fall. We have here
&s;everal other Remarks upon the&s;e <HI>Dollar,</HI> and the Alterations of
their Value from the Year 1575; and the Chapter is concluded, with Advice to
note the Valuation of <HI>Hamborough,</HI> where it has been at fif|ty-four
<HI>Stivers</HI> the Dollar, which makes the Exchange above forty Shillings of
their Money for Twenty of ours. 
<Q REND="inline">"And tho' we have rai&s;ed the Price of Exchange
from Twenty-four Shillings, Nine-pence, to about Thirty-five Shillings, &s;hall
we re&s;t here and go no further? And &s;hall we be like Men that halting in
Je&s;t, become Lame in Earne&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P>Chap. II. <HI>Shews the Cau&s;es of the Decay of Trade in the
Merchandize of England,</HI> by an Examination al&s;o of &s;everal Heads in the
manner afore&s;aid, as Fir&s;t, <HI>The Want of Money.</HI> 
<PB N="101" REF="128"> Secondly, <HI>Extortionate U&s;ury.</HI> Thirdly,
<HI>Litigious Law-Suits.</HI> Fourthly, <HI>Free Fi&s;hery of Foreigners in his
Maje&s;ty's Seas</HI>; with the Rea&s;ons of our own Merchants in favour of
that Liberty, as if <HI>England</HI> cou'd not maintain a <HI>Sea</HI> and
<HI>Land Trade</HI> together; al&s;o &s;everal <HI>Examples,</HI> how other
Princes neglect not the Advantage to be made of their Seas, but both encourage
their own Subjects to fi&s;h in them, and make other Nations pay Duty for the
like: Which have long determin'd the que&s;tion of <HI>Mare Liberum,</HI>
allowing the <HI>Freedom of the Seas</HI> for <HI>Navigation,</HI> where it
does not prejudice the di&s;tinct <HI>Dominion</HI> of Princes concerning their
<HI>Fi&s;hery.</HI> Fifthly, <HI>The Abu&s;es of our Drapery.</HI> Here we have
a particular, that the dre&s;&s;ing and dying of them, were in&s;i|&s;ted on to
be done in <HI>England</HI> in 1616, and that then 64 Thou&s;and Cloths were
exported; with a Digre&s;&s;ion of our Author's upon the envious Interpretation
of his Studies for the welfare of the Kingdom, particularly in his Invention of
<HI>Farthing</HI> Tokens, which are yet found mo&s;t commodious to prevent the
wa&s;te of Silver, and relieve the Poor. Sixth|ly, <HI>The Policies of
Merchants in monopolizing the Exportation of Cloths.</HI> Seventhly, <HI>The
fal&s;e making of our Cloth.</HI> And here we have the Inconveniences of
engro&s;&s;ing in Trade further laid open. Eighthly, <HI>The Exportation of the
Mate|rials of Wool,</HI> and the <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> or <HI>Impo&s;itions</HI>
laid upon Cloths at Home and Abroad. Ninthly, <HI>The Wars in Chri&s;tendom,
and Pirates,</HI> occa&s;ioning the fall of Wool from 33 to 18 Shillings the
Tod, and the incon&s;iderate <HI>Barter</HI> of it Abroad. Tenthly, <HI>The
immoderate U&s;e of Foreign Commodities,</HI> which concludes this Chapter.</P>
<P>Chap. III. <HI>Of Governed Trade and therein of Monopoly.</HI>
Here we have &s;ome further curious Ob&s;ervations upon the <HI>Exchange</HI>
of Money, and among others the Proverbial Cha|racter in <HI>Bodin</HI> of a Man
of Experience and di&s;tingui&s;hing Head, when they &s;ay, <HI>Il entend le

and a Compari&s;on of <HI>Exchange</HI> to the <HI>A&s;&s;ay</HI> of Money.
Commendations of Ma|&s;ter <HI>Hu&s;&s;ey,</HI> Governor of the
Merchant-Adventurers, in the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, for
the great Pains he took in &s;ettling the <HI>Parity</HI> of Exchanges, however
the true Remedy to rule the Cour&s;e of them, was but lately found out. The
Opinions of mercantile Men upon the <HI>be&s;t Methods</HI> of Traffic, with
our Author's Di&s;cu&s;&s;ions thereup|on; as, <HI>Whether Foreign Nations
&s;hou'd come and fetch our Wares? And whether there &s;hou'd be no Societies
or Corpora|tions</HI> <PB N="102" REF="129"> <HI>of Merchants?</HI> Which tho'
our Author is for allowing, under Government, in appointed Places, becau&s;e
they may, by &s;uch Order, be remov'd, or recall'd; and for that no Nation
trafficks &s;o much in the bulk of &s;taple Commodities; in&s;omuch, that two
Years before the taking of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> all the Wares in
<HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> vented there, in one Year, being valued, the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> amounted to four Parts in &s;ix: Yet we mu&s;t not flatter
Companies or Societies, &s;ays he, in their unadvi&s;ed or irregular
Proceedings; for a Society may be|come a Monopoly, when &s;ome few Merchants
have the whole managing of a Trade to the hurt of a Commonwealth, and when many
others might al&s;o negotiate for the common good. Here we have a Definition of
a <HI>Monopoly,</HI> and an Approbation of the Cu&s;tom in the City of
<HI>Noremberg</HI>; where they receive all the Manufactures of the People, and
paying the&s;e weekly, &s;ell tho&s;e for a rea&s;onable Profit. This is
fol|lowed with &s;ome Ob&s;ervations on the Royal Commodity of <HI>Tin,</HI>
which above 100 Years pa&s;t, was &s;old for 40 Shil|lings the Hundred, when
the be&s;t <HI>Velvets</HI> were &s;old for 10 Shillings the Yard. Al&s;o of
the Abolition and Re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of <HI>Prae-emption,</HI> whereby the
Wealth of the Kingdom has been &s;ince encrea&s;ed 600 Thou&s;and Pounds
<HI>Sterling,</HI> and his Maje&s;ty received for his Benefit 150 Thou&s;and
Pounds. Al&s;o how the Importation of <HI>Spani&s;h Tobacco,</HI> gains the
Kingdom many Thou&s;and Pounds yearly. Next we have his Opinion upon <HI>Joint
Stocks</HI> in Companies; and la&s;t|ly, the general Intention of all Grants,
by <HI>Letters Patent,</HI> for New Inventions; with Reflections upon tho&s;e,
e&s;pecial|ly relating to <HI>Alloms,</HI> rendering the Commodity dearer to
the Subject, and cheaper to the Tran&s;porter or Stranger; which he re&s;embles
to the Silver Mines of the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> maintained at his own
Charge, called the <HI>Wild|man</HI>; which cau&s;e him to coin Dollars, having
his Arms on one &s;ide, and a Savage Man on the other, holding a burning Candle
in his Hand, with this In&s;cripton, <HI>Aliis in&s;erviendo,
con&s;umor.</HI></P>
<P>Chap. IV. <HI>Of want of Government in Trade.</HI> And herein he
&s;ets down the Errors in Trade, committed by Merchants, relating to Cloths,
and the making over their Moneys beyond Seas. Then he proceeds, Fir&s;t, To
enu|merate the <HI>Defective Means and Remedies,</HI> no le&s;s than
Thirty-five, which have been tried the&s;e 350 Years, and next, to &s;hew,
wherein they have been found fruitle&s;s, and that the decrea&s;e of Wealth in
a Kingdom, may be compre|hended <PB N="103" REF="130"> under the&s;e Heads: The
&s;elling our Native Com|modities too cheap, buying Foreign Wares too dear, and
exporting our Money in Specie, or exchanging it for Money by Bills; and how the
Undervaluation thereof cau&s;es it to be exported or hinders the Importation.
This leads us, in the la&s;t Place, to</P>
<P>Chap. V. <HI>Of the Remedies for all former Cau&s;es of the Decay
of Trade.</HI> Here he begins with his Remedies, Fir&s;t, For the
<HI>undervaluing</HI> our Money, by <HI>overvaluing</HI> Foreign Coin; and
the&s;e are, by the Reformations of <HI>Exchange</HI> here propo&s;ed, in
cau&s;ing the Value of our Money to be given in Exchange; which wou'd out off
the Gain had by the Exporta|tion of it, and make Foreign Coin not to be
received above Value. More particularly, how, this recovery of
<HI>England</HI>'s Wealth is to be effected by Proclamation, and by publick
Tables, fixed up at the <HI>Royal Exchange;</HI> like tho&s;e kept at
<HI>Dover</HI> in the Time of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. to receive the
Pa&s;&s;enger's Money, and by Exchange in Specie for it be|yond Seas; which
made them leave their Moneys in the Realm. Further al&s;o, by taking warning
from the Incon|veniencies of inhancing Moneys; in &s;everal Examples of King
<HI>Henry</HI> VI. who rai&s;ed the Ounce of Sterling Silver from 20 to 30
Pence, and King <HI>Edward</HI> IV. from 30 to 40 Pence. And King
<HI>Henry</HI> VIII. his rai&s;ing the <HI>Angel No|ble</HI> from 6 Shillings
and 8 Pence, to 7 Shillings and 4 Pence, and afterwards to 7 Shillings and 6
Pence, whereby every Ounce of <HI>Sterling</HI> Silver was worth 45 Pence; yet
there was nothing effected thereby, the Money &s;till altering beyond Sea.
Wherefore <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI> had power given to alter the Valuation from time to
time as he &s;aw cau&s;e. Soon after, it is &s;hewn how the <HI>Turks,
Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> are, by keeping the Price of their
Exchanges above the Valuation of their Mo|neys, more politick than we. Hence
the Que&s;tion is re|&s;olv'd, whether it is more expedient to rai&s;e the
Price of Exchange or the Valuation of Money. Next he &s;hews how the want of
Money has &s;unk the Price of <HI>Plate,</HI> from 5 Shil|lings and 8 Pence to
5 and 2 Pence, and what wou'd be the Con&s;eqence of its ri&s;ing. Here he
recommends all wrought Plate to be try'd and mark'd, al&s;o all Silver Thread
from abroad; and that they &s;hou'd receive our Wool in Ex|change for it. The
Con&s;umption of Foreign Commodities or over-ballancing of them, is referr'd to
the Con&s;iderations upon the Abu&s;e of Exchange before: And the exce&s;&s;ive
U&s;e of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> to the Limitation of <HI>Spani&s;h Tobacco</HI>
lately e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd, <PB N="104" REF="131"> that the Plantations of
<HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Bermudas</HI> may be advanced thereby. The want of
Money thro' the <HI>Wars</HI> and <HI>Piracies,</HI> is compris'd in the
Reformation of <HI>Exchange</HI> and the Policy of <HI>Rewards.</HI> Thus
having, to the Cau&s;es of the want of Money, join'd &s;ome Means for
&s;upplying it; he comes to the Remedys al&s;o for the Decay of Trade: And
here, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Under the Head of <HI>U&s;ury,</HI> to be remedied by
Money procur'd as afore directed, he recommends the Cu&s;tom of &s;etting over
<HI>Bills</HI> of <HI>Debt</HI> from one Man to ano|ther; and a Stock to erect
<HI>Pawn-Hou&s;es</HI>; and for principal Towns to take in Money upon the
Adventure of their own or other Men's Lives; as at <HI>Venice,</HI> where a
Man, for three or four Hundred Pounds, &s;hall be &s;ure of one Hundred Pounds
a Year for Life. The <HI>Third</HI> Cau&s;e of Decay in Trade, a&s;cri|bed to
litigious Law-Suits, our Author thinks there can be no &s;horter Cour&s;e to
remedy than is us'd upon Proof and Specialities, if the Pleadings and
I&s;&s;ues be join'd according to the fir&s;t In&s;titution; whereby the
<HI>Matter of Fact</HI> may ap|pear before a Jury: For touching the <HI>Matter
of Law,</HI> it, being &s;eparated, makes a <HI>Demurrer</HI> to be determin'd
by the Judge. Here he commends the Cour&s;e in <HI>Germany,</HI> to take down
litigious Humours, where a Fine of Twelve-pence in the Pound, or more is paid,
to the Emperor or Magi&s;trates, for &s;o much as is claim'd of the Defendant
more than can be proved to be due, be&s;ides further Charge, if he be found to
proceed upon Revenge. As for the Differences between Merchants, he refers to
his <HI>Lex Mercatoria</HI>; as al&s;o the <HI>Fourth</HI> Remedy, in behalf of
the Fi&s;hing Trade. The <HI>Fifth</HI> upon making Cloth abroad, is partly
redre&s;s'd by the late Proclamation, to prohibit Exportations of that kind.
And the Rules of our Author for the true making of Cloth, may be a Remedy for
the <HI>Seventh</HI> Cau&s;e of Decay, as al&s;o to the <HI>Eighth</HI>; but
the <HI>Sixth,</HI> concerning the <HI>Policy of Merchants,</HI> is
recommended, for the general and not particular Good, to the In&s;pection of a
Committee; &s;o that other Merchants may upon rea&s;onable Con&s;iderations be
admitted of the &s;aid Companies. The <HI>Ninth</HI> Cau&s;e is partly handled
in the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> and as to <HI>Bankrupts,</HI> &s;ome Remedy is
a&s;&s;ign'd al&s;o before, in &s;etting over Bills of Debt; and the Defects in
the Statute again&s;t them, is to be remedied by the Authority of
<HI>Chan|cery,</HI> to the Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to examine the &s;ame.
The Remedy to the <HI>Tenth</HI> and la&s;t Cau&s;e of our &s;aid De|cay, the
Immoderate U&s;e of Foreign Commodities, con|&s;i&s;ts, as was ob&s;erved
before, partly in reforming the Abu&s;e <PB N="105" REF="132"> of Exchange,
whereby &s;uch Abundance is imported, and partly in re&s;training the
Affectation of the Vulgar, to imi|tate their Superiors, by their being deprived
of their Ill Examples. Our Author concludes, That all the&s;e Cau&s;es of the
Decay of Trade in <HI>England,</HI> are mo&s;tly compri&s;ed in that One, the
<HI>Want of Money,</HI> whereof the <HI>Abu&s;e of Ex|change</HI> is the
<HI>Efficient</HI> Cau&s;e; which made him project &s;o ea&s;y <HI>a
Remedy;</HI> whereby the Kingdom &s;hall enjoy the <HI>Three E&s;&s;ential
Parts</HI> of Traffic, under Good and Politic Govern|ment, which will
effectually produce a <HI>Free Trade.</HI></P>

Nobility, created later than the Year 1645, and the Date in the Title-Page of
the Volume, is but two Years later; we ob&s;erve, by his mentioning the Death
of <HI>Francis</HI> Lord <HI>Cottington, fol.</HI> 288, That he mu&s;t have
writ the Conclu&s;ion of this Book, at lea&s;t, &s;o late as the Year 1652. If
&s;ome few Mi&s;takes have e&s;caped in the Blazonry, or in the Hi&s;torical
Account of the Alliances and I&s;&s;ue, they are not greater, perhaps, than
what might be rea|&s;onably expected in any other Heraldical Work, where &s;uch
Di&s;tinctions are undertaken; e&s;pecially in &s;uch Extent of Time, and,
con&s;equently, &s;uch Variety of Families.</NOTE>.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the Margins of this <HI>Title-Page,</HI> we have the Arms of
Twenty of our Kings <HI>before</HI> the <HI>Conque&s;t,</HI> painted in their
proper Colours; that is, from <HI>Egbert</HI> down to <HI>Harold,</HI> who
lo&s;t the Kingdom to <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Norman.</HI> 
<PB N="106" REF="133"> And the <HI>Preface,</HI> is <HI>A Di&s;cour&s;e
concerning the Nobility of England, according to the Laws of England.</HI> The
begin|ning whereof, for a Ta&s;te of the Author, we &s;hall here give in his
own Words. 
<Q REND="inline">"As in the Body natural, for the Pre|&s;ervation
of the whole, the different Temperature of Hu|mours, and Offices in &s;everal
Members, are requi&s;ite: So likewi&s;e in the Body Civil, or Politic,
different E&s;tates and Degrees among Men have been judged as nece&s;&s;ary.
And as the Elements cannot be intermingled one with another, except it be by an
unequal Proportion and Temperature: So Civil Societies cannot po&s;&s;ibly be
pre&s;erved, but by a certain Inequality; which is apparent by the different
Forms of Government, ob&s;erved and e&s;tabli&s;h'd in all Countries: And the
ancient Policy of this Realm of <HI>England,</HI> being govern'd by
<HI>Royalty,</HI> ever &s;ince it was known to be an in|habited Piece of Earth,
hath admitted of a Threefold Divi|&s;ion of Per&s;ons, <HI>viz. King,
Nobles,</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI>; which hath been a Government very Ancient,
and fully under|&s;tood, both by Magi&s;trates and People; and rooted in Mens
Affections both by long habituated Excerci&s;e, and the well approved Benefits
received thereby."</Q></P>
<P>After this, he proceeds to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;everal Degrees,
or Titles of Honour; and fir&s;t of the <HI>King,</HI> and his Sove|reign
Power. That many of his Rights are termed <HI>Flowers of the Crown</HI>; in
which re&s;pect <HI>Bracton,</HI> &s;peaking of them, &s;ays, The King's
<HI>material</HI> Crown is adorned with <HI>Flowers.</HI> Al&s;o, that &s;ome
of his Rights are by po&s;itive, or written <HI>Laws</HI>; others by right of
<HI>Cu&s;tom.</HI> And that the <HI>Regalia,</HI> or En&s;igns of Royalty,
e&s;pecially the <HI>Crown, Scepter, Purple Robe,</HI> and <HI>Golden
Ball,</HI> are as old among us, as King <HI>Ar|thur,</HI> according to the
Te&s;timony of <HI>Leland.</HI> Next he &s;hews, That the <HI>Nobility,</HI>
comprehend the <HI>Prince, Dukes, Marque&s;&s;es, Earls, Vi&s;counts,</HI> and
<HI>Barons</HI>; as the <HI>Commons,</HI> con&s;i&s;t of <HI>Knights,
E&s;quires, Gentlemen, Yeomen, Artificers,</HI> and <HI>Labourers.</HI> Which
la&s;t are not here further &s;poken of, <PB N="107" REF="134"> this Work
confining it&s;elf to the &s;uperior <HI>Nobility.</HI> There|fore, having
given us the Derivation of <HI>Nobilitas,</HI> from the Word <HI>No&s;co,</HI>
as one known, or <HI>notable</HI> for his Vertue, or the reward of it, he
di&s;tingui&s;hes, why they are called Peers, and the whole Body of them the
Baronage; what difference there is in their Parliament Robes; how they are
tryed by the whole Body, and in what Ca&s;es they retain both their
<HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> and <HI>Surnames</HI>; then de&s;cends more particularly
to their &s;everal Degrees. Here we &s;ee, That the Title of <HI>Prince,</HI>
was called by the <HI>Saxons, Aetheling:</HI> That the <HI>Nor|mans</HI> only
call'd him the <HI>King's Son,</HI> and the <HI>fir&s;t begotten</HI> of the
King of <HI>England,</HI> till King <HI>Edward</HI> I. &s;ummoned his Son
<HI>Edward</HI> to Parliament, by the Title of <HI>Prince</HI> of
<HI>Wales</HI> and Earl of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI>; and <HI>Edward</HI> III. created
his Son Duke of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> &s;ince which this Title has been
appropriated to the King's fir&s;t Son. That as for the Title of <HI>Duke,</HI>
it was fir&s;t of <HI>Charge</HI> and <HI>Office,</HI> not of <HI>Dignity,</HI>
after the A|bolition of the <HI>Roman</HI> Government here; and that this
De|gree in the Days of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> was inferior to that of
<HI>Co|mites</HI>; moreover, upon what Conditions this Title of Duke was
conferr'd, as al&s;o that of Earl, or what Qualifications were requir'd in
them; namely, Faithfulne&s;s and Valour ap|proved, with the Protection of
Widows and Orphans; that People, under their Regiment, might with Joy continue
in Peace. That the Title began under <HI>Otho</HI>; but in <HI>England,</HI>
not before King <HI>Edward</HI> III. created his Son <HI>Edward</HI>
afore&s;aid, and al&s;o his two other Sons; from which time we have had
Hereditary Dukes. That the <HI>Marque&s;s</HI> was not known to us, till King
<HI>Richard</HI> II. made his Minion <HI>Robert Vere</HI> Earl of
<HI>Oxford,</HI> Marque&s;s of <HI>Dublin;</HI> and became not till then a
Title of Honour, for before, tho&s;e who govern'd the <HI>Marches,</HI> were
commonly called Lord <HI>Marcheres.</HI> The Title of <HI>Earl,</HI> &s;ome
think to be derived from the <HI>Germans,</HI> who had their <HI>Comites</HI>
according to <HI>Tacitus</HI>; but others think it came from the
<HI>Romans,</HI> and that before <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> the
Name of <HI>Comes</HI> was not u&s;ed as a Title of Honour. That after the
di&s;&s;olution of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, this Title of Earls was retained
by our <HI>Engli&s;h Saxons;</HI> and the <HI>Danes</HI> termed them by a Word,
&s;ignifying Honourable, which, &s;omewhat mollified, agrees with what we at
pre&s;ent call them. That they became not, before the <HI>Normans</HI> got
footing here, Feudal, Hereditary and Patrimonial, as ap|pears by
<HI>Dome&s;day-Book.</HI> After that, they were created with the Additional
Name of a <HI>Place,</HI> and A&s;&s;ignment of the <PB N="108" REF="135">
<HI>Third Penny</HI> of the Shire, as appears by the Empre&s;s <HI>Maud's</HI>
Creation (the mo&s;t ancient Form which has been &s;een) of <HI>Geoffrey
Mandevill, Earl</HI> of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> And King <HI>John</HI> was the
fir&s;t we meet with, who u&s;ed the Cincture of a Sword in their Creation, and
they waited at his Table there with it by their Side. It was the next Age
before the Impo&s;ition of a Chaplet, Cap of Honour with a Circlet of Gold came
up, which after that, as at this Day, was turn'd into a Coro|net with Rays or
Points. The <HI>Earls Palatine</HI> were rec|kon'd mo&s;t Honourable, and
<HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> held the Earldom of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> as freely by the
Sword, as the King held <HI>England</HI> by the Crown. To which was added, the
di&s;tinction of bearing the Sword at Coronations; called <HI>Curtana,</HI>
which being blunt betokened Mercy. This Earl ordained Barons and Abbots to
&s;erve in his Parliament, who with him made Laws for the Government of his
County. Earldoms of Title without Place, as the <HI>Earl Mar&s;hal</HI> of
<HI>England,</HI> be|gan under King <HI>Richard</HI> II. who gave that Title to
<HI>Thomas Mowbray</HI> Earl of <HI>Nottingham.</HI> As for
<HI>Vi&s;counts,</HI> it is al&s;o an old Name of Office, but a new one of
Dignity; not be|ing known among us for a Title of Honour before King
<HI>Henry</HI> VI. who created <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Beaumont, Vi&s;count
Beaumont.</HI> Here 'tis remarked, That after a Man is cre|ated an Earl or
Vi&s;count, or any other Title of Honour a|bove them, his Title becomes parcel
of his Name, and not an Addition only, and in all Legal Proceedings he mu&s;t
be &s;tiled by that Dignity. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> We come to the <HI>Barons.</HI>
And here 'tis ob&s;erved that our ancient <HI>Britons</HI> did not ac|knowledge
the Name, and that in the <HI>Engli&s;h Saxon</HI> Laws it is not &s;een: That
in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Glo&s;&s;ary of <HI>Alfricus,</HI> a|mong the Vocables or
Terms of Honour; <HI>Dominus</HI> is tran&s;|lated <HI>Laford,</HI> which we
have contracted into <HI>Lord,</HI> and the <HI>Danes</HI> called their Free
Lords, who equall'd the Barons of our Time, <HI>Thani.</HI> And that in a
Fragment of the Laws of <HI>Canute,</HI> was the fir&s;t mention of a
<HI>Baron</HI> with us; yet there|in, according to the Varieties of Copies, is
indifferently read, <HI>Virones, Barones,</HI> and <HI>Thani.</HI> The Service
of the&s;e Barons appears from the Laws of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, into
which tho&s;e Ordinances of <HI>Canute</HI> are tran&s;lated in the
<HI>Norman</HI> Tongue, where it being ordain'd, That the <HI>Heriot</HI> or
<HI>Relevies</HI> &s;hould be moderate, and tho&s;e of an <HI>Earl,</HI>
men|tion'd, it appears that &s;ome of tho&s;e Accoutrements (for the Wars) to
be rai&s;ed by the <HI>Barons,</HI> were but half in propor|tion; as, four
Hor&s;es, two Swords, four Spears, and four <PB N="109" REF="136"> Targets; but
for the re&s;t, only one Helmet, one Coat of Mail, and in Money only 50
<HI>Mances</HI> or <HI>Marks</HI> of Gold, which are but a fourth Part. Al&s;o
after the coming of the <HI>Normans, Valva&s;ors</HI> and <HI>Thanes</HI> were
ranged in Degree next after <HI>Barons</HI>; and our learned Interpreters have
thought the Dignity of <HI>Barons</HI> was comprehended un|der the
<HI>Valva&s;ores Majores,</HI> afterward called <HI>Capitanii,</HI> and that
the like Dignity was, by the <HI>Engli&s;h Saxons</HI> before the Conque&s;t
called <HI>Thanes,</HI> according to <HI>Lambert</HI> in his
<HI>Per|ambulation</HI> of <HI>Kent.</HI> Neither was the Name of
<HI>Baron</HI> then granted to be of great Honour, &s;ome <HI>Earls</HI> having
in tho&s;e Days their <HI>Barons</HI> under them, of which here are Examples
produced. A few Years after they were accounted <HI>Barons,</HI> who held an
entire <HI>Barony,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of 13 <HI>Knights Fees</HI> and one
Third, which amounted to 400 Marks yearly: A <HI>Knight's Fee</HI>
con&s;i&s;ting of 12 <HI>Carves</HI> of Land, a <HI>Carve</HI> of 8
<HI>Oxgangs,</HI> an <HI>Oxgang</HI> of 15 Acres. The&s;e <HI>Baronies</HI>
were held, &s;ome of the King, and tho&s;e who had them of this Value, were
taken for <HI>Barons</HI> by Fee, to which was annexed a Dignity with
Juri&s;diction; which the <HI>Court Barons</HI> in &s;ome &s;ort prove. In King
<HI>Henry</HI> IIId's days, there were reckon'd in <HI>England</HI> 150
<HI>Baronies.</HI> But this Dignity attained to its highe&s;t Honour after that
King in the 49th Year of his Reign, &s;ummon'd a &s;elect Number to the
Parliament, and they of the mo&s;t ancient Families and excellent
Qualifica|tions, and decreed that none other &s;hou'd come; which his Son
<HI>Edward</HI> I. al&s;o con&s;tantly ob&s;erv'd. Hence they were only
accounted <HI>Barons,</HI> whom the King by &s;uch Writs of Sum|mons did call
to Parliament. And 'tis ob&s;erv'd, to the great Glory of this King
<HI>Edward,</HI> that he did always direct his &s;aid Writs to tho&s;e of the
be&s;t Families, and who&s;e Wi&s;dom and Virtues were an&s;werable: But
pa&s;s'd over their Sons af|ter their Death, if they were not equal to their
Parents in Under&s;tanding and all other commendable Qualities. Here we have
&s;ome curious Que&s;tions debated upon this Head, as, <HI>Whether a Barony by
Writ, may de&s;cend from the An|ce&s;tor to the Heir? Whether it may de&s;cend
to the Heir Fe|male, who is nearer a-kin than the Males? And whether, if it may
de&s;cend to &s;uch Females, their Husbands may a&s;&s;ume the Style and
Dignity of &s;uch a Barony.</HI> Herein are Argu|ments produced on both &s;ides
of the&s;e Que&s;tions, after which follow others, to compound the
Controver&s;y, by our Author. So from the Nature, Quality and State of 
<PB N="110" REF="137"> <HI>Barons</HI> by <HI>Writ,</HI> he pa&s;&s;es to
<HI>Barons</HI> by <HI>Creation,</HI> begun by King <HI>Richard</HI> II. And
for the Explanation of this Dignity, here al&s;o are &s;ome Que&s;tions
re&s;olved. Then he proceeds to di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Barons</HI> by
<HI>Tenure</HI>; or &s;uch as held any Ho|nour, Ca&s;tle, or Manor, as the Head
of their Barony, by Barony, or Grand Serjeanty: That they were
<HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Temporal,</HI> the former of whom having lo&s;t
their Seat in Parliament, 17 <HI>Car.</HI> he &s;ays nothing more of them; but
of the Temporal <HI>Barons</HI> by <HI>Tenure,</HI> having &s;hewn that &s;uch
there were, he lays down &s;ome Arguments and Examples to determine the
Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether after alienating the Lands by which they hold, they can
retain their Title and Dignity?</HI> Thus having touch'd upon the Original,
Nature and diffe|rent Degrees of our <HI>Peerage,</HI> he concludes, with
&s;ome Ob|&s;ervations upon their <HI>Privileges,</HI> this his Preface,
con&s;i&s;t|ing of Twenty-&s;ix Pages.</P>
<P>The Work begins with a Di&s;play in one Leaf, of the <HI>Arms</HI>
of our Kingdom under its different Governments, in five &s;everal
<HI>Scutcheons,</HI> repre&s;enting in their proper Co|lours, tho&s;e of the
<HI>Saxons, Romans, Britons, Danes,</HI> and the <HI>Normans</HI> in the
middle. So we turn over, and begin with the Nobility under <HI>William</HI> the
<HI>Conqueror</HI>; and fir&s;t with <HI>Edgar Etheling,</HI> who was
<HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Oxford</HI> before, and at the coming of the &s;aid
<HI>William</HI> into <HI>England.</HI> A &s;hort Account being given of this
Earl, and his Arms painted on the &s;ide of it, we have two other contemporary
Nobles treated of after the like Manner, in the &s;ame Page; and this regular
Method of Hi&s;torizing three Noblemen in every Page, with the
<HI>Blazonry</HI> of their Arms in the Mar|gin, except where the Pages and
Scutcheons are not fill'd up, which is very rare, is pur&s;ued through every
Reign. That of the Conqueror, taking up 28 Pages, con&s;equently gives account
of 84 Noblemen. After this, the <HI>Noblemen</HI> of every Reign, are led up by
the Arms of every <HI>King</HI> then reigning, in the middle of a Blank Leaf,
and nothing more written under them than the Name of the King. We ob|&s;erve no
<HI>Quarterings</HI> in the King's Arms, from the Con|que&s;t, till we come to
<HI>Edward</HI> III. nor any <HI>Supporters</HI> of, or <HI>Badges</HI> over
them, till then: But from hence they con|&s;tantly appear, changing with the
&s;everal Lines or Races of the &s;aid Kings. In the Reigns of <HI>William</HI>
afore&s;aid, King <HI>James,</HI> and King <HI>Charles,</HI> are the greate&s;t
Number of No|blemen; in which la&s;t, Baron <HI>Sutton</HI> is the la&s;t
mention'd; <PB N="111" REF="138"> and in the Reigns of <HI>Henry</HI> IV.
<HI>Richard</HI> III. <HI>Henry</HI> VII. <HI>Edward</HI> VI. <HI>Mary</HI> and
<HI>Elizabeth,</HI> e&s;pecially as this la&s;t reigned &s;o long, there are
the fewe&s;t Noblemen mention'd. Other Ob&s;ervations upon this MS. and
Deductions from them, might be made; but at this Time, the&s;e may &s;uffice in
this Place.</P>

proficiency of Arts and Sciences and the Advancement of Learning.</HI> By JOHN
WEBSTER. Quarto, 1654. <HI>Pages</HI> 110.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THE Author <HI>Dedicates</HI> this Tract to Major General
<HI>Lambert,</HI> having had experimental Knowledge and Trial of his Abilities,
for the reforming of <HI>Academies,</HI> and of his &s;incere Affection and
unparallel'd Love to <HI>Learning.</HI></P>
<P>In his <HI>Epi&s;tle, To all who truly love the Advancement of
Learning in the</HI> Univer&s;ities of <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI>
or el&s;ewhere; he anticipates &s;everal Objections, which might be rai&s;ed
again&s;t &s;o private a Per&s;on as him&s;elf, for undertaking thus freely, to
handle an Argument of this publick Nature and Con&s;equence. And one of them,
where he &s;ugge&s;ts he &s;hou'd be look'd upon as a <HI>Leveller</HI>; he
an&s;wers, by &s;ay|ing, 
<Q REND="inline">"He mu&s;t needs &s;o far own <HI>Levelling,</HI>
that he holds <HI>plain</HI> Dealing to be a Jewel, and that <HI>plain</HI>
Ways &s;eem to him mo&s;t &s;ecure and comfortable: That the <HI>Prelacy,</HI>
tho' it &s;ought to bow him, cou'd not break him: That tho' the
<HI>Presbyterian</HI> Pride did &s;eem to threaten him, it cou'd not hurt him;
and the <HI>Independent</HI> Forms cou'd never inform him beyond the Ba&s;is of
a better Building than Man can erect. That the &s;poil of Aca|demies cou'd
never plea&s;e his Mind, nor &s;hou'd they <PB N="112" REF="139"> fill his
Pur&s;e. That he was no Dean, nor Ma&s;ter, Pre|&s;ident, nor Provo&s;t;
Fellow, nor Pen&s;ioner; nor had Tythes appropriate, or impropriate;
Augmentation, or State Pay. That all the <HI>Levelling</HI> in the&s;e Times,
had not mounted him, nor cou'd they make him fall lower: And he that wou'd
rai&s;e him&s;elf by the Ruins of others, or <HI>warm</HI> him&s;elf by the
<HI>burning</HI> of <HI>Schools,</HI> he wi&s;hes no greater Plague than his
own <HI>Ignorance,</HI> or that he may ever gain more <HI>Knowledge</HI> than
to live to repent."</Q> There are certainly many good Ob&s;ervations in the
Book; and if a few Animadver&s;ions might by Critical Exami|ners, be made upon
his Style in &s;ome Places, and, per|haps, his Choice of exceptionable Matter,
or the Efficacy of his Expedients, for the Reformation propos'd; yet the Work
will &s;till demand regard for the eminency of the At|tempt, and a Subject of
&s;uch great Importance, may ren|der the mo&s;t imperfect Hints in it &s;o, to
Heads which can rai&s;e out of them more effectual Improvements. But in|deed,
this Matter is not feebly recommended by the Au|thor him&s;elf, as in other
Parts of the Work, &s;o in the Con|clu&s;ion of the <HI>Epi&s;tle,</HI> wherein
having inform'd us, That he intends not to a&s;per&s;e the Per&s;on of any, nor
to traduce or calumniate the <HI>Academies</HI> them&s;elves; but only the
Corruptions which Time and Negligence have introdu|ced there, and &s;imply to
attempt &s;ome <HI>Reformation,</HI> not <HI>E|radication</HI> of their
Cu&s;toms and Learning: 
<Q REND="inline">"He adds, which, tho' I have, peradventure, but
weakly managed, yet I hope my poor Mite, with the Candid and Ingeni|ous, will
be accepted; for the re&s;t, I value them not; and I intreat the more able to
&s;upply, what my want of Strength hath left incomplete. I have rather intended
this as an <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> to break the Ice to &s;ome more able Judgment,
than as &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to perform what is aimed at; becau&s;e I have
neither performed what I &s;hou'd have done, nor what I cou'd, but only traced
out &s;ome few clear Things, as a guide to higher and more noble
Undertakings."</Q></P>
<P>After &s;ome Ver&s;es, by his Friends, in prai&s;e of the Au|thor
and his Work, he enters upon it, divided under <HI>Ele|ven Chapters,</HI> in
the following Manner. I. <HI>Of the general Ends of erecting Public
Schools;</HI> under which, he tells us; 
<Q REND="inline">"If the <HI>Academies</HI> had kept within their
own Sphere, and on|ly taught <HI>Human Science,</HI> and had not, in Pride and
Vain-Glory, mounted into the Chariot of the Sun like <HI>Phae|ton</HI>; 
<PB N="113" REF="140"> they had then, neither di&s;order'd, nor injur'd
<HI>Theo|logy,</HI> that is above them, nor the Things of Nature, which they
account below them."</Q> II. <HI>Of the Divi&s;ion of Academic Learning, and
fir&s;t of School Theology.</HI> Hence, having &s;poken of Perplexities wherein
the pre&s;umptuous Imaginations of Mankind have en&s;nared and intangled
them|&s;elves, he proceeds to, III. <HI>The Divi&s;ion of Human Learning; and
fir&s;t of Tongues, or Languages.</HI> Herein the greate&s;t Objection is, the
making &s;ome Sciences meerly &s;peculative; as <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI>
according to that of <HI>Seneca; No&s;traque erat</HI> Philo&s;ophia,
<HI>facta</HI> Philologia <HI>e&s;t, ex qua, di&s;putare dicemus, non
vivere;</HI> and the like of <HI>Mathematicks.</HI> Then he pro|ceeds to divide
the Sciences in a manner mo&s;t commodi|ous for his Purpo&s;e; beginning with
tho&s;e &s;ub&s;ervient or conducive to others, as <HI>Grammar;</HI> under
which he com|mends Dr. <HI>Webb</HI>'s Enterprize of teaching the
<HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, by an ea&s;y <HI>Clau&s;ulary</HI> Method; and the
elaborate Pains of Mr. <HI>Brin&s;ley.</HI> So de&s;cends to the recommendation
of <HI>Hieroglyphical, Emblematical, Symbolical</HI> and
<HI>Cryptographi|cal</HI> Learning, all relative to <HI>Grammar</HI>;
inferrable from the Labours of <HI>Oughtred, Harrington, Spanheim, Porta,
Trithe|mius, Agrippa, Claramuel, Silenus,</HI> and Frier <HI>Bacon,</HI> with
the like Prai&s;es of a <HI>Univer&s;al Character, Dactylogy,</HI> the <HI>Real
Character</HI> of the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Jacob Behmen</HI>'s
<HI>Language of Nature.</HI> After his Ob&s;ervations upon the&s;e Relatives to
Grammar, he goes on to di&s;cour&s;e in the IV. Chapter, <HI>Of Logic.</HI> And
here &s;hews what a <HI>Civil War</HI> of <HI>Words</HI> it is made; the
Imperfections of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Sy&s;tem, and of <HI>Logic</HI>
it&s;elf; with the Con&s;equence of <HI>Tully's Alphabetical</HI> way of
<HI>Syllogizing,</HI> and concludes with Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Opi|nion of
<HI>Logic,</HI> as it is abu&s;ed. So we come to V. <HI>The Ma|thematical
Sciences.</HI> And here he complains how &s;hame|fully the Foundation-Stone to
this great Building, <HI>Arithme|tic,</HI> has been neglected or thrown a&s;ide
by our <HI>Academic</HI> Ma&s;ters, and but for &s;ome private Spirits, &s;uch
as <HI>Napier, Briggs, Oughtred</HI> and a few others, it had lain as a Garden
unweeded. The like is ob&s;erved of <HI>Geometry</HI>; al&s;o, how lately, by
how few, and tho&s;e Foreigners, any <HI>Optical</HI> Im|provements appear'd.
That <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> has indeed had &s;ome Pains and Honour &s;hew'd to that
Part of it, which is the concomitant of, or Spur to Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s; which
is the Companion of Melancholics, Fanta&s;tics, Courtiers, Ladies, Taverns, and
Taphou&s;es. But any higher Advancements of it, for di&s;covering natural
Knowledge, and the Harmony of the <PB N="114" REF="141"> Univer&s;e remains
unattempted. The Ab&s;urdities of our Schola&s;tic Sy&s;tems of
<HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> are next largely laid open; as that the Earth is the
Centre of the Univer&s;e, and the hea|venly Orbs immutable; that they are
&s;olid Bodies, the Ve|locity of the Tenth Sphere, and of the Eighth, or Starry
Sphere. In <HI>Co&s;mography</HI> the Deficiences are next mention'd,
e&s;pecially in the mutual Corre&s;pondence and Application of the Heavens and
Earth; nor are the Theorems of <HI>Hy|drography</HI> brought into Practice,
whereby Men might be made able for Navigation. <HI>A&s;trology,</HI>
notwith&s;tanding all the Derogation of the Schools, and Di&s;credit brought
upon it, by the Ignorance and Knavery of pretended Scioli&s;ts, our Author
recommends as a laudable and profitable Study; and arraigns the negligence of
Univer&s;ities for having &s;o lit|tle regarded the Improvement of <HI>Statics,
Architecture, Pneumatithmy, Stratarithmetry,</HI> and the re&s;t enumerated by
the learned Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> in his Preface to <HI>Euclid.</HI> Hence we pa&s;s
VI. <HI>To Schola&s;tic Philo&s;ophy.</HI> Herein <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> is
pull'd to pieces, from the beginning to the end, and Rea&s;ons drawn for
denying the Palm to the <HI>Peripatetic</HI> Philo&s;ophy, from the uncertainty
we are in, both as to his Books and Doctrine, as al&s;o the defectivene&s;s of
tho&s;e which we lea&s;t doubt to be his; whence we are led to ob&s;erve, in
what Parts of Phy&s;ical Knowledge the Schools are mo&s;t deficient, and
the&s;e are <HI>Natural Magic, Chymi&s;try, Medicine, Anatomy, Surgery,</HI>
and <HI>Phy&s;iognomy,</HI> Coele&s;tial and Subcoele&s;tial,
<HI>Onei|rocratics</HI>; be&s;ides the <HI>Magnetical</HI> Philo&s;ophy, for
which Dr. <HI>Gilbert, Ridley, Carpenter, Barlow</HI> and <HI>Cabaeus,</HI> are
&s;o much commended; and the <HI>Atomical</HI> Learning, reviv'd by
<HI>De&s;cartes,</HI> and improv'd by <HI>Magnenus, Regius, White, Dig|by,
Phocyllides, Holwarda,</HI> and others. Then we proceed, VII. <HI>To
Metaphy&s;ics, Ethics, Politics, Oeconomics, Poe&s;y</HI> and <HI>Oratory.</HI>
Where having &s;hewn what airy, in&s;ufficient, de|lu&s;ive, and meer
Ornamental A&s;&s;i&s;tances they are made, and thus run over &s;ome defects of
<HI>Academic</HI> Learning, tho' not all, intimating that a great Part
de&s;erves to be eradicated, &s;ome reform'd, and all meliorated in our &s;aid
Schools, he moves on to VIII. <HI>Their Cu&s;toms and Method,</HI> leaving
their Manners and Maintenance to others. Here the fir&s;t Ob|jection is, that
tho' there are divers Hou&s;es in one Univer|&s;ity; yet all Students mu&s;t
follow one another like Carriers Hor&s;es in one accu&s;tom'd Path. The
&s;econd, is the &s;loth|ful Performance of their Schola&s;tic Exerci&s;es,
their Public Acts being kept but four Times in a Year. 3. The Injury of 
<PB N="115" REF="142"> tying all Men to one &s;et Cour&s;e of Years, before
they can re|ceive their Degrees. 4. The ridiculous Levity of their hi&s;torical
Per&s;onations in the performance of their Exer|ci&s;es. 5. Their empty and
windy Di&s;putations therein, without any Foundation from Indu&s;try, or
practical Expe|rience. 6. Their Confinement in all Exerci&s;es to the
<HI>La|tin</HI> Tongue. 7. Too much admiring Antiquity. 8. Being bound in with
multiplicity of Voices. 9. Adhering to Au|thority, e&s;pecially of
<HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI> 10. The Immethodical Cour&s;e of in&s;tructing Youth in
<HI>Logic</HI> and <HI>Natural Philo&s;o|phy,</HI> before they have ta&s;ted
the Rudiments of <HI>Mathemati|cal Knowledge</HI>: But as before an old
Building is demoli&s;h'd, a Platform is u&s;ually devi&s;ed for a better. So
our Author in Cap. IX. Offers &s;ome <HI>Expedients or Remedies in Theology,
Grammar, Logic and Mathematics</HI>; wherein, though he thinks what he has
before produced for demon&s;trating the ill Compo&s;ure of the
<HI>Schola&s;tic</HI> Fabric of Learning, not far from the Truth, and tho' he
here acknowledges his own In&s;ufficiency to make a more &s;erviceable
Sub&s;titution: yet, <HI>In magnis, volui&s;&s;e, &s;at e&s;t.</HI> He will do
his Endea|vour, and hopes that abler Hands will &s;upply his Defects. Having
offer'd his &s;aid Means for regulating the Study of the&s;e Sciences, he
continues after the like manner, to treat in Cap. X. <HI>Of &s;ome Helps in
Natural Philo&s;ophy</HI>; in which he highly celebrates the Writings of Dr.
<HI>Flud.</HI> So gives us la&s;tly, in Cap. XI. <HI>Some Expedients concerning
their Cu&s;tom and Method:</HI> And hopes they will be acceptable till better
be found out.</P>

Dedication and Preface.</HI></BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THE Intention of this Treati&s;e is, by a&s;&s;embling &s;uch a
Variety as it contains, of new Improvements in all Sci|ences, to rai&s;e able
and pregnant Heads from a drou&s;y Ac|quie&s;cence in the Di&s;coveries of
former Times, and tempt them from tho&s;e Modern Advancements, with
Encourage|ments to proceed. And tho' the Author intends not a full Hi&s;tory of
the &s;aid Improvements, and their Authors; yet the mo&s;t remarkable of them
are in&s;tanced, at lea&s;t &s;o far as may &s;erve his aim of confuting his
Antagoni&s;t, and exci|ting Philo&s;ophical Endeavours: In which he has has a
prin|cipal regard to the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> by giving a &s;uccinct
Ac|count of the Purpo&s;es and Productions of that Illu&s;trious A&s;&s;embly,
for the Information of &s;uch as have not met with their excellent
Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>After his <HI>Dedication</HI> to <HI>William</HI> Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> and his <HI>Preface</HI> to the Clergy of
that Dioce&s;e, we come to the <HI>Work</HI> it&s;elf; which, in the running
<HI>Title,</HI> is called, <HI>Mo|dern Improvements of u&s;eful Knowledge</HI>;
and is divided into <HI>Eighteen</HI> Chapters, tho' the whole is written by
way of Letter to a Friend. The fir&s;t Chapter containing his Intro|duction,
&s;hews the Occa&s;ion of writing this Treati&s;e, to have proceeded from a
Di&s;pute the Author had with an old Clergyman in his Neighbourhood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Name was as we find el&s;ewhere, Dr. <HI>Robert Cro&s;s,</HI>
Rec|tor of <HI>Chue</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> in which Country, our
Author <HI>Glan|vill</HI> was Rector of <HI>Bath,</HI> afterwards Chaplain in
Ordinary to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and Prebendary of <HI>Worce&s;ter. A.
Wood</HI> &s;ays of him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That he was a Per&s;on of more than ordinary
Parts, of a quick, warm, &s;pruce and gay Fancy, and was more lucky, at lea&s;t
in his own Judgment, in his fir&s;t Hints and Thoughts of Things, than in his
after Notions. He had a very tena|cious Memory, and was a great Ma&s;ter of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language, expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf therein with ea&s;y
Fluency, and in a manly, yet withal a &s;mooth Style."</Q> Tho' the &s;aid Dr.
<HI>Cro&s;s</HI> wrote a Book again&s;t this <HI>Plus Ultra,</HI> he cou'd not
get it printed; and tho' Dr. <HI>Stubbes</HI> al&s;o wrote another again&s;t
it, the &s;ame was not much regarded. See a further Account of this <HI>Plus

&s;o wedded <PB N="117" REF="144"> to the <HI>Peripatetic</HI> Philo&s;ophy,

contend, 
<Q REND="inline">"That he had more Advantages for Knowledge, than
either the Royal Socie|ty, or all the pre&s;ent Age."</Q> But, &s;ays our
Author, in the Conclu&s;ion of this Chapter, 
<Q REND="inline">"As my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> ob&s;erves well,
<HI>Philo&s;ophy as well as Faith mu&s;t be &s;hewn by its Works:</HI> And if
the <HI>Moderns</HI> cannot &s;hew more of the Works of their Philo&s;ophy in
&s;ix Years, than the <HI>Ari&s;tote|lians</HI> can produce of theirs in more
than <HI>thrice</HI> &s;o many <HI>hundred,</HI> let them be loaded with all
that Contempt, which is u&s;ually the reward of vain and unprofitable
Pro|jectors."</Q> Chap. 2. <HI>Is upon the Ways of improving u&s;eful
Knowledge,</HI> Fir&s;t, by enlarging the Hi&s;tory of Things, and next by
improving Intercour&s;e and Communications: Al&s;o upon the Advantages of this
Age, from the great Advance|ments of Chymi&s;try and Anatomy. Here we have a
brief recital of the many Di&s;coveries made in the Body of Man, and the Names
of the Phy&s;icians who made them; more par|ticularly, of the
<HI>Circulation</HI> and <HI>Transfu&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Blood.</HI> Chap. 3.
<HI>On the Advantage of late Times from the Improvements of Mathematics,</HI>
particularly in <HI>Arithmetic,</HI> by <HI>Logarithms, Napier</HI>'s
<HI>Bones,</HI> and <HI>Decimals</HI>; al&s;o in <HI>Algebra</HI> and
<HI>Geometry,</HI> and by whom they have been improved. Chap. 4. Is upon
<HI>the Improvements,</HI> more particularly in <HI>Geometry,</HI> by <HI>Des

Metius,</HI> Inventor of the Tele&s;cope, <HI>Scheiner, Kepler, Bullialdus,
Hevelius,</HI> and &s;everal others, ending with Dr. <HI>Seth Ward,</HI>
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sarum,</HI> who had demon&s;tratively proved the Elliptical
Hypothe&s;is. Chap. 16. Recites <HI>the Im|provements of Optics and
Geography.</HI> Here we learn that <HI>Roger Bacon</HI> &s;o much commended, by
<HI>Picus Mirandula</HI> and <PB N="118" REF="145"> <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> wrote
accutely of <HI>Optics</HI>; by what Hands <HI>Dioptrics</HI> al&s;o were
improved, and that in <HI>Geography</HI> likewi&s;e, Improve|ments have been
great, as may be found, by comparing the Works of &s;ome Moderns here named,
with the be&s;t Re|mains of the Ancients. Chap. 7. Is upon <HI>the Aids of
u&s;eful Knowledge by In&s;truments, as the</HI> Tele&s;cope, Micro&s;cope
<HI>and</HI> Thermometer. Chap. 8. <HI>Of the</HI> Barometer <HI>and</HI> Air

more complete, by that further Addi|tion to the <HI>Lives</HI> of the
<HI>Knights Companions,</HI> which our Au|thor intended, had not &s;ome
malicious In&s;inuations withheld the Encouragement, he was very near
attaining, to re-im|bur&s;e his Expences therein; as we have learn'd from his
own Words, both in Print and Manu&s;cript<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>His Words in Print are the&s;e. 
<Q REND="inline">"We once intended a full and entire Hi&s;tory
of the <HI>Lives</HI> of the&s;e Noble <HI>Founders,</HI> and to that purpo&s;e
made a large and chargeable Collection out of the Records in the Tower of
<HI>London,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, of all that we could find worthy to be
remember'd in them; in which we &s;pent mo&s;t part of the Years 1657, 1658,
1659. But this our De&s;ign being afterwards repre&s;ented (20 <HI>Feb.
Anno</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> II.) to the pre&s;ent Sovereign and Knights
Com|panions, by the late <HI>Chancellor of the Order,</HI> through the wrong
End of the Per&s;pective; we thereby received &s;o great Di&s;cou|ragement, as
cau&s;ed us to wave it, and indeed re&s;olved wholly to lay it a&s;ide.
Neverthele&s;s, upon other Thoughts, we are content to let in a
<HI>glimp&s;e,</HI> of what may be improved to a far greater <HI>Light</HI>;
and from that Stock of Collections have drawn out &s;ome few Things relating to
the <HI>Founder,</HI> and fir&s;t 25 <HI>Knights</HI> Companions; particularly,
their Honours, Martial Employments, famous Exploits, Matches, I&s;&s;ues and

<BIBL><HI>Order of the Garter,</HI> fol. 643.</BIBL></Q></P> 
<P>But from a MS. of his own Writing, we find Mr.
<HI>A&s;hmole</HI> fir&s;t took this <HI>Work</HI> of the <HI>Garter</HI> into
Con&s;ideration about the Year 1655: That the Charges of his
<HI>Collections</HI> for it, amount|ed to 500<HI>l.</HI> before the
Re&s;toration, and to no incon&s;iderable Sum after it: Yet ob&s;erving how
meagre the Memorials were, which had been pre&s;erved of the <HI>Ancient</HI>
Companions; he peti|tion'd the King in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1660, that his
Maje&s;ty wou'd add to the other Officers of the Order, a particular
<HI>Hi&s;toriographer</HI> and a <HI>Remembrancer,</HI> with the Salary of only
100 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> as ne|ce&s;&s;ary to tran&s;mit their Noble Companions
for the future more &s;uitably to Po&s;terity; and mode&s;tly hoped to have the
&s;ame be|&s;tow'd upon him&s;elf, as what might bring &s;ome Authority to his
Performance, lighten his Charges, and rai&s;e him above the de|triment of
Cen&s;ure. King <HI>Charles,</HI> having been inform'd of his <HI>Rea&s;ons,
Labour, Expences</HI> and <HI>Qualifications,</HI> &s;igned a Warrant for the
&s;ame, directed to Sir <HI>Henry de Vic, Chancellor</HI> of the
<HI>Order,</HI> authorizing the Patent to be pa&s;s'd under the Seal thereof.
But the &s;aid Chancellor refu&s;ed to pa&s;s it, under pre|tence of Mr.
<HI>A&s;hmole</HI>'s Irregularity in procuring it, and not only alledg'd he
ought to have obtained his fir&s;t Grant by the Hand of the &s;aid
<HI>Chancellor,</HI> and the <HI>Chapter,</HI> that is, (as Mr.
<HI>A&s;hmole</HI> him&s;elf words it) have &s;ought it of tho&s;e who wou'd
ob&s;truct it; but in <HI>Feb.</HI> 1661, laid an <HI>Information</HI> thereof
before the <HI>Chapter</HI> then held, and Mr. <HI>A&s;hmole</HI> was not
admitted either to make a <HI>Defence</HI> of him&s;elf, or &s;hew the
<HI>Advantages</HI> of the <HI>Office</HI> propo|&s;ed, &s;o it was laid
a&s;ide; and he pre&s;ented a Draught in Writing of the <HI>Objections</HI>
there made again&s;t &s;uch an In&s;titution, and his <HI>An&s;wers</HI>
thereto, which he dedicated in <HI>Dec.</HI> 1662, to the Lord
<HI>Chancellor</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> From which MS. <HI>Of his Arguments
for an Hi&s;toriographer and Remembrancer to the Order of the Garter,</HI> we
have extracted thus much of this Paragraph; and &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that
&s;uch a di&s;couragement of an Attempt <HI>to write Hi|&s;tories and Lives of
&s;uch Great Men, in the complete Circuite of their Stories,</HI> &s;eems no
ways wonderful. For this is <HI>Biography</HI> in its &s;trict Sen&s;e; which
is of a &s;earching Nature; and, however u&s;eful or acceptable to the
generality, as irk&s;ome to &s;ome Thoughts, as Light to &s;ome Eyes; yea, may
be as terrible to &s;ome among the Living, as to others, the Expectation of
being <HI>anatomiz'd</HI> when they are dead. However King <HI>Charles</HI>
re|warded this Author, who thus <HI>ennobled</HI> even the mo&s;t
<HI>Noble</HI> Or|der like a Prince, who de&s;erved to be, as he was, the

only of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Aeneid,</HI> as &s;ome might imagine from the
&s;lender Bulk of the Book; nor is it here tran&s;lated into Ver&s;e, as they
might al&s;o expect, in imita|tion of the Original, and as nothing appears to
the contrary in the Title above, printed at the End: but it is rather a
Reduction of that <HI>Epic Poem</HI> to an <HI>hi&s;torical</HI> Narrative in
<HI>Pro&s;e;</HI> which, tho' a commendable Undertaking at that time, to
familiarize the Contents; yet, as it is but a Tran&s;|lation of a
Tran&s;lation; as the Original it&s;elf is familiar e|nough now, and we have
al&s;o many better Tran&s;lations, even in Ver&s;e, directly from it; the very
Table of Heads, no le&s;s than &s;ixty-five, cannot be in this Place
de&s;irable Therefore, we &s;hall only refer to a Note at Bottom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And fir&s;t, of the <HI>French Author</HI>; who as he begins his
Work &s;o high as the Building of <HI>Troy</HI> by <HI>Priamus,</HI> &s;o he
con|tinues it beyond the Slaughter of <HI>Turnus</HI> by <HI>Aeneas,</HI> to
the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of his Son <HI>A&s;canius,</HI> and two or three
Suce&s;&s;ions beyond. Moreover, towards the beginning of his Work, that is, in
<HI>Chapter</HI> 6, he has a Digre&s;&s;ion upon <HI>Bocace,</HI> for relating
the Story of <HI>Dido</HI> in his <HI>Fall of Princes,</HI> differently from
<HI>Virgil,</HI> and recites his Account as well as that of his Author. And in

<HI>becau&s;e 'tis feign'd, and not to be believed</HI>; as if &s;everal other
Parts of this Story, which he has repeated, were not as incredible as that. But
to pa&s;s to the Tran&s;lator and <HI>Printer,</HI> we ob&s;erve his Style to
be more <HI>ornate</HI> (as he calls it) or dre&s;s'd up in &s;uperfine Words,

been, had he not &s;ubmitted it to the Correction. It is more regularly printed

upon a Style, or Manner of Expre&s;&s;ion, more than the Matter expre&s;&s;ed,

<P>This <HI>Preface,</HI> containing near two Leaves, is as follows: 
<Q REND="inline">"After dyver&s;e Werkes made, tran&s;lated and
achieved, hav|ing noo Werke in hande; I, &s;ittyng in my Studye, where|as laye
many dyver&s;e Paunflettis and Bookys, happened that to my Hande cam a lytyl
Booke in <HI>Fren&s;he,</HI> which late was tran&s;lated out of <HI>Latyn</HI>
by &s;ome Noble Clerke of <HI>Fraunce</HI>; whiche Booke is named
<HI>Eneydos,</HI> made in <HI>Latyn</HI> by that noble Poete and grete Clerke
<HI>Vyrgyle.</HI> Which Booke I &s;awe over and redde therein; how after the
generall De&s;truccyon of the grete <HI>Troye, Eneas</HI> departed, beryng his
olde Fader <HI>Anchi&s;es</HI> upon his Sholdres, his lityl Son <HI>Yolus</HI>
on his Honde; his Wyfe wyth moche other People followynge; and how he &s;hypped
and departed, wyth alle th Hy&s;torye of his Adventures, that he had 'er he cam
to the Achievement of his Conque&s;t of <HI>Ytalye,</HI> as all a longe &s;hall
be &s;hewed in this pre&s;ent Boke. In which Booke I had grete Play&s;yr, by
cau&s;e of the fayr and hone&s;t Terms and Wordes in <HI>Fren&s;he;</HI> which
I never &s;awe to fore lyke, ne none &s;o play&s;aunt, ne &s;o wel ordred.
Which Booke, as me &s;emed, &s;holde be moche requy&s;ite to Noble Men to
&s;ee, as wel for the Eloquence, as the Hy&s;toryes, how wel that many honderd
Yerys pa&s;&s;ed was the &s;ayd Booke of <HI>Eneydos</HI> with other Werkes
made and learned dayly in Scolis, &s;pecyally in <HI>Ytalye</HI> and other
Places. Whiche Hi&s;torye the &s;ayd <HI>Vyrgyle</HI> made in Metre. And whan I
had advi&s;ed me in this &s;ayd Booke, I delybered and concluded to tran&s;late
it into <HI>Engly&s;he,</HI> and forthwyth toke a Pen and Ynke and wrote a Leef
or tweyne, which I over&s;awe agayn to corecte it: and whan I &s;awe the fayr
and &s;traunge Termes therein, I doubted that it &s;holde not plea&s;e &s;ome
Gentylmen, whiche <PB N="129" REF="156"> late blamed me, &s;aying, that in my
Tran&s;lacyons I had over curyous Termes which coude not be under&s;tande of
comyn Peple, and de&s;ired me to u&s;e olde and homely Termes in my
Tran&s;lacyons, and fayn wolde I &s;atysfye every Man. And &s;o to doo toke an
olde Boke and redde therein, and certaynly the <HI>Englys&s;he</HI> was &s;o
rude and brood, that I coude not well under&s;tande it. And al&s;o my Lord
Abbot of <HI>We&s;tmyn&s;ter</HI> ded do &s;hewe to me of late certayn
Evydences wryton in old <HI>Englis&s;he,</HI> for to reduce it into our
<HI>Englys&s;he</HI> now u&s;id; and certaynly it was wreton in &s;uch wy&s;e,
that it was more lyke to <HI>Dutche</HI> than <HI>Englys&s;he</HI>; I coude not
reduce ne brynge it to be under&s;tonden. And certaynly our Langage now u&s;ed
varyeth ferre from that which was u&s;ed and &s;poken whan I was born; for we
<HI>Englys&s;h</HI> Men ben borne un|der the Domynacyon of the <HI>Mone,</HI>
which is never &s;ted|fa&s;te, but ever waverynge, wexyng one Sea&s;on, and
waneth and dy&s;crea&s;eth another Sea&s;on; and that comyne
<HI>Englys&s;he</HI> that is &s;poken in one Shyre varyeth from another. In
&s;o muche, that in my dayes happened that certayn Merchauntes were in a Shipp
in <HI>Tamy&s;e,</HI> for to have &s;ayled over the See into <HI>Zelande</HI>;
and for lacke of Wynde they taryed atte <HI>Forlond,</HI> and went to lande for
to refre&s;he them; and one of them named <HI>Sheffelde,</HI> a Mercer, came
into an Hows, and axed for Mete, and &s;pecyally <HI>he axed for Eggs,</HI> and
the goode Wyf an&s;werde, that <HI>&s;he coude &s;peke no Fren&s;he</HI>; and
the Marchaunt was angry, for he al&s;o coude &s;peke no <HI>Fren&s;he,</HI> but
wolde have hadde Egges, and &s;he under&s;tode hym not. And thenne at la&s;te
another &s;ayd, That <HI>he wolde have Eyren</HI>; then the good Wyf &s;ayd,
that &s;he under&s;tod him wel. Loo what &s;holde a Man in thy&s;e Days wryte,
<HI>Egges</HI> or <HI>Eyren?</HI> Cer|taynly it is harde to play&s;e every Man,
by cau&s;e of Dy|ver&s;ite and Chaunge of Langage. For in the&s;e Days every
Man, that is in ony Reputacyon in his Countre, will utter his Communicacyon and
Matters in &s;uch Man|ners and Termes, that fewe Men &s;hall under&s;tonde
them; and &s;om hone&s;t and grete Clerkes have ben wyth me, and de&s;ired me
to wryte the mo&s;te curyous Termes that I coude fynde. And thus bytween playn,
rude, and cu|rious, I &s;tand abas&s;hed. But in my Judgemente, the comyn
Termes that be dayli u&s;ed ben lyghter to be un|der&s;tonde than the old
auncyent <HI>Englys&s;he.</HI> And for as moche as this pre&s;ent Booke is not
for a rude uplondys&s;h <PB N="130" REF="157"> Man to laboure therin, ne rede
it, but only a Clerk and a noble Gentleman, that feleth and under&s;tondeth in
Fayles of Armes, in Love, and in noble Chyvalry; ther|for in meane bytwene
bothe, I have reduced and tran&s;la|ted this &s;ayd Booke into our
<HI>Englis&s;he,</HI> not over rude, ne curyous; but in &s;uch Termes as
&s;hall be under&s;tanden by Goddys Grace accordyng to my Copye. And yf ony Man
wyll entermete in redyng of hit, and fyndeth &s;uche Termes that he cannot
under&s;tande, late hym goo rede and lerne <HI>Vyrgyll,</HI> or the Py&s;tles
of <HI>Ovyde,</HI> and ther he &s;hall &s;ee and under&s;tande lightly all, yf

unconnynge Man to &s;ee, but Clerkys and very Gen|tylmen that under&s;tands
Gentylnes and Scyence. Then I praye alle theym that &s;hall rede in this lytyl

<P>THO' there is no Date in the <HI>Title Page</HI> of this
Hi&s;tory, we have ventured to add the &s;ame that appears at the End of the
<HI>Dedication,</HI> which is made thereof to <HI>the Right Wor&s;hipful Sir
Philip Sidney,</HI> by the &s;aid Dr. <HI>Powel.</HI> Herein, this Editor,
in&s;tead of extolling the noble Gifts and Vertues in his &s;aid Patron, which
were con&s;picuous to all Men, exhorts him to the diligent Exerci&s;e of them;
and particu|larly, from tho&s;e dome&s;tick Examples, his noble
<HI>Father,</HI> con&s;tantly inclined more to benefit even <HI>Wales</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> be&s;ides his own Country, than him&s;elf; and his honourable
Father-in-Law, Sir <HI>Francis Wal&s;ingham,</HI> the Queen's Chief Secretary;
who&s;e Zeal for God's Glory, and Love of tho&s;e who feared him unfeignedly,
was well known to the World. 
<Q REND="inline">"Follow, &s;ays he, their Foot&s;teps, with the
Remembrance of that noble Hou&s;e out of which you are de&s;cended by your
honourable Mother; and then you cannot do a|mi&s;s. Labour, by the Example of
your Father, <HI>to di&s;|cover, and bring to light, the Acts of the famous Men
of elder Times,</HI> who, with Conference of the State and Go|vernment of all
Ages, will bring you to the perfect <HI>Ex|perience</HI> <PB N="132" REF="159">
of tho&s;e things that you have learned out of <HI>Ari&s;|totle, Plato,</HI>
and <HI>Cicero,</HI> by your Travel in Philo&s;ophy. Your Father, with his
great Expences and Labour, hav|ing procured and gotten to his hands the
<HI>Hi&s;tories of Wales and Ireland</HI> (which Countries for many Years with
great Love and Commendation he govern'd) committed unto me <HI>this of
Wales,</HI> to be &s;et forth in Print, with Direction to proceed therein, and
nece&s;&s;ary Books for the doing thereof. And altho' I was un&s;ufficient for
doing of it, yet I have done mine Endeavour; and now do pre&s;ent the &s;ame
unto your Wor&s;hip, as by good Rea&s;on due to the Son and Heir of Him that
was the Procurer and Bringer of it to light," <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>From the Editor's <HI>Epi&s;tle to the Reader,</HI> his
<HI>Notes</HI> on the <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> and the Beginning thereof it&s;elf,
we learn, That this <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h Princes</HI> was the
Work of <HI>Carodoc</HI> of <HI>Lancarvan,</HI> from the Reign of
<HI>Cadwalader,</HI> the la&s;t <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Monarch, over the <HI>whole
I&s;land,</HI> (who fled into <HI>Armorica,</HI> or <HI>Bretagne,</HI> Anno
680, and died at <HI>Rome</HI> eight Years after, with who&s;e Departure to
that Part of <HI>France,</HI> and a Li&s;t of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Kings
ruling there, this <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> begins) down to &s;ome Years of <HI>Owen
Gwyneth</HI>'s Reign over that <HI>Part of the I&s;land,</HI> now called
<HI>Wales</HI>; that is to the Year 1157, or the 3d of <HI>Henry</HI> II. King
of <HI>England,</HI> as may be &s;een, <HI>p.</HI> 206. The
<HI>Continuation</HI> which follows for 113 Years, from that time, was yearly
regi&s;ter'd in the Abbeys of <HI>Con|way</HI> and <HI>Stratflur,</HI> down to
the Year 1270; or the 54th of our <HI>Henry</HI> III. which was a little before
the Death of the la&s;t <HI>Lhewelyn</HI>; and here ends this <HI>Briti&s;h
Chronicle;</HI> as ap|pears <HI>p.</HI> 327. Many Copies remained of it, at
this time, in <HI>Wales;</HI> mo&s;t of them 200 Years old; and one of them
coming to the hands of Mr. <HI>Humphrey Lhoyd,</HI> a learned and skillful
Antiquary, he tran&s;lated it into clear &s;mooth <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and
continued it chiefly out of <HI>Matt. Paris,</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Trivet,</HI>
to the Slaughter of the &s;aid Prince <HI>Lhew|elyn,</HI> the la&s;t of
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Blood who had the Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> in 1282; or
the tenth of our <HI>Edward</HI> I. that is, to <HI>page</HI> 375 of this
Volume. But before this Tran&s;lation and Continuation were thoroughly
poli&s;hed by the &s;aid <HI>H. Lhoyd,</HI> he was taken away by Death, in the
Flower of his Time. Yet the Copy of his Labour being procured, and pre&s;erved
by Sir <HI>Henry Sidney,</HI> Lord Pre&s;ident of <HI>Wales,</HI> he prefer'd
our Editor, Dr. <HI>Powel,</HI> to the Care of its Publication; who, procuring
all the printed Hi&s;tories which treated of <HI>Wales,</HI> 
<PB N="133" REF="160"> and the U&s;e of all <HI>John Stow</HI>'s MS.
Hi&s;tories, and many Books of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Pedegrees from the Lord
<HI>Burghley,</HI> with his Authority for &s;earching all the <HI>Records</HI>;
did not only correct the &s;aid Tran&s;lation, but put marginal References in
it to tho&s;e Hi&s;torians who treated of the particular Facts, and additional
Notes, likewi&s;e throughout of Matters relating to <HI>Wales</HI> in tho&s;e
Hi&s;torians, unmentioned in his Copy; al&s;o inter&s;per&s;ed the &s;ame with
many authentic In|&s;truments, Records and Pedigrees; and la&s;tly made a
fur|ther Continuation <HI>Of the Princes of Wales of the Blood Royal of
England,</HI> and the <HI>Lords Pre&s;ident,</HI> down to his own Time; the
whole ending with the afore&s;aid Sir <HI>Henry Sidney</HI> at <HI>page</HI>
401. So that Authors have been too indi|&s;tinct, when they have quoted every
Part of this Book un|der one Name. Thus much for the general View; now to be a
little more particular.</P>
<P>After the Editor's Epi&s;tle before mentioned, follows a
<HI>De&s;cription of Cambria, now called Wales: Drawn fir&s;t by</HI> Sir
<HI>John Pri&s;e,</HI> and <HI>afterwards augmented by H. Lhoyd;</HI> and here
prefixed for the better under&s;tanding of this Hi|&s;tory. Herein, upon the
Name of <HI>Wallia,</HI> there is Occa&s;ion taken by the &s;aid
<HI>Lhoyd,</HI> it &s;eems, to make a liberal Cen|&s;ure of <HI>Polydore
Virgil,</HI> being a Stranger, as well to many of our Hi&s;tories, as the
Tongues they are written in, and a Reference made to the <HI>Apology</HI> of
Sir <HI>John Pri&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory he purpo&s;ely
writ again&s;t the envious Reports and &s;launderous Taunts of the &s;aid
<HI>Polydore</HI>; who&s;e Errors in great number are there confuted. And it is
fur|ther &s;hewn, that <HI>Wales</HI> is a new and &s;trange Name, which the
<HI>Britains</HI> do not under&s;tand; that they know no other than
<HI>Cambry,</HI> nor of their Language than <HI>Cambraec,</HI> or the
<HI>Cambers</HI> Tongue; That they know not what <HI>England</HI> or
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> means, but call the Country <HI>Lhoyger</HI> (from
<HI>Locrine</HI>) the <HI>Engli&s;hmen, Say&s;on</HI>; and their Tongue
<HI>Say&s;onaec</HI>; which is a Token this is the old <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Language: For the Works of <HI>Merdhyn</HI> and of <HI>Talie&s;&s;in,</HI> who
wrote above 1000 Years pa&s;t, are almo&s;t the &s;ame Words as they u&s;e at
this Day, or at lea&s;t under&s;tood by all who know the <HI>Wel&s;h
Tongue.</HI> Then he di&s;cour&s;es of the Three Remnants of the
<HI>Britains,</HI> in <HI>Wales, Cornwal,</HI> and little <HI>Britain,</HI> or
<HI>Bre|tagne</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> The Bounds of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the
Divi&s;ion thereof, into <HI>Three</HI> Territories, that is, <HI>North-Wales,
South-Wales,</HI> and <HI>Powys-Land</HI>; &s;ubdivided into their &s;everal 
<PB N="134" REF="161"> <HI>Candreds,</HI> and <HI>Comots</HI>; and all
expre&s;s'd in their old <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Names.</P>
<P>Thus we come to the Hi&s;tory, which has a little wooden
<HI>Print</HI> at the Head of every Chapter or Prince's Reign, more for
Ornament, we pre&s;ume, than real Re&s;emblance; becau&s;e they are
di&s;continued at the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> of whom
&s;ome true Repre&s;entation was more likely to be recovered. The Hi&s;tory is
too &s;hort to be made &s;horter, by any thing that looks like an Epitomy;
be&s;ides, it cannot prudently be de&s;ired, we &s;hould be &s;o long confined
from the De&s;cription of other Books, as to give an Ab&s;tract of every
Prince's Reign in this. It may be therefore &s;uffi|cient, that we here draw
out a <HI>Table</HI> of their <HI>Names,</HI> with a Chronology of their
<HI>Deaths,</HI> and the Names of tho&s;e Princes, who were their
<HI>Contemporaries</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> which will be of general U&s;e in
Reading any other Piece of <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory.</P>

the gallant Adventurers recorded therein to &s;o many heroic Exploits, before

Ance&s;tors, as to render, by this means, their Memory no le&s;s durable and
exten&s;ive, than their Merits have demanded. For it may, perhaps, be thought
im|politic, thus to di&s;play the mo&s;t hazardous and the mo&s;t generous
Enterpri&s;es which appear in this Book, for the Honour and Advantage of our
Country, till the Vertues of our <HI>Predece&s;&s;ors</HI> will not reflect
di&s;advantageous Compari&s;ons upon the <HI>Po&s;terity</HI> who &s;hall
revive them. But there may be &s;till room left for a more favourable
Con&s;truction of &s;uch Neglect, and to hope that no|thing but the ca&s;ual
Scarcity or Ob&s;curity of a Work, &s;o long &s;ince out of Print, may have
prevented its falling into tho&s;e able and happy Hands, as might, by &s;uch an

leave of it, with re|ferring only to a needful Ob&s;ervation or two at the
Bot|tom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> As it has been &s;o
u&s;eful to many of our Authors, not only in <HI>Co&s;mography</HI> and
<HI>Navigation,</HI> but in <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> e&s;peci|ally that of the
glorious Reign in which &s;o many brave Exploits were atchieved: As it has been
&s;uch a <HI>leading Star</HI> to the <HI>Naval Hi&s;tories</HI> &s;ince
compiled; and &s;aved from the Wreck of Oblivion many exemplary Incidents in

<HI>la&s;tly,</HI> Tho' the fir&s;t Volume of this <HI>Collection</HI> does
frequently appear, by the Date, in the Title Page, to be printed in 1599. the
Reader is not thence to conclude the &s;aid Volume was then reprinted, but only
the Title Page, as upon collating the Books we have ob&s;erved; and fur|ther,
that in the &s;aid la&s;t printed Title Page, there is no men|tion made of the
<HI>Cadiz</HI> Voyage; to omit which, might be one Rea&s;on of reprinting that
Page: For it being one of the mo&s;t pro&s;perous and honourable Enterprizes
that ever the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was ingaged in, and he falling into
the Queen's unpar|donable Di&s;plea&s;ure at this time, our Author, Mr.
<HI>Hakluyt,</HI> might probably receive Command or Direction, even from one of
the Patrons to whom the&s;e Voyages are dedicated, who was of the contrary
Faction, not only to &s;uppre&s;s all Memorial of that Action in the Front of
this Book, but even cancel the whole <HI>Narrative</HI> thereof at the
<HI>End</HI> of it, in all the Copies (far the greate&s;t Part of the
Impre&s;&s;ion) which remained unpub|li&s;hed. And in that ca&s;trated Manner
the Volume has de&s;cended to Po&s;terity; not but if the Ca&s;tration was
intended to have been concealed from us, the la&s;t Leaf of the Preface would
have been reprinted al&s;o, with the like Omi&s;&s;ion of what is there
mentioned concerning the In&s;ertion of this Voyage. But at la&s;t, about the
middle of the late King's Reign, an unca&s;trated Copy did ari&s;e, and the
&s;aid Voyage was reprinted from it; whereby many imperfect Books have been
made complete.</NOTE>.</P>

<HI>&amp;c.</HI></BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS learned Treati&s;e, being publi&s;hed after the Au|thor's
Death, is <HI>dedicated</HI> to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Can|terbury,</HI> by
<HI>Robert Brerewood,</HI> who, as it is thought, did al&s;o compo&s;e the
<HI>Preface</HI> to the Reader, &s;hewing the <HI>Oc|ca&s;ions</HI> the Author
had to write the en&s;uing <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e;</HI> and briefly de&s;cribing the
general State of <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> for a Supply to the
&s;aid Work.</P>
<P>It is divided into <HI>Twenty-&s;even Chapters</HI>; and treats,
<HI>fir&s;t, Of the antient Largene&s;s</HI> or Extent <HI>of the</HI> Greek
<HI>Tongue,</HI> and the Cau&s;es thereof, with its Declen&s;ion, upon the
Inundation of the <HI>Saracens,</HI> about 640 Years after our Saviour, in the
Time of <HI>Heraclius</HI> the Emperor. 2. More particularly <HI>of the Decay
of the antient pure Greek,</HI> and of the pre&s;ent vulgar <HI>Greek</HI>;
neverthele&s;s that the pre&s;ent Language does not &s;o much decline from the
ancient <HI>Greek,</HI> as the <HI>Italian</HI> departs from the
<HI>Latin,</HI> according to <HI>Bello|nius:</HI> for that there were
Corruptions, even in the ancient <HI>Greek</HI>; however, it is concluded, that
the Skilful in the learned <HI>Greek</HI> cannot under&s;tand the
<HI>vulgar.</HI> 3. <HI>Of the Extent of the Roman Tongue in the time of the
Roman Empire,</HI> with the Cau&s;es of its &s;preading, and in what Parts of
the Em|pire it was mo&s;t &s;poken: That it was little re&s;pected in the
<HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Parts thereof, and why. 4. <HI>That the Roman Tongue
aboli&s;hed not the vulgar Languages in the foreign Provinces of the Roman
Empire,</HI> but that near fourteen Tongues here mention'd (in which Number the
<HI>Engli&s;h, Italian, Spani&s;h,</HI> <PB N="160" REF="187"> and
<HI>French,</HI> are not reckoned, our Author in&s;tancing only Original or
Mother Languages) were in <HI>Europe</HI> in the Time of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Empire, and &s;ix or &s;even of them within the Limits of it. From hence it is
ob&s;erved, how hard it is to &s;up|plant vulgar Languages in populous
Countries: That neither the <HI>Punic,</HI> nor the <HI>Gallic,</HI> the
<HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Pannonian</HI> Tongue was aboli&s;hed by the
<HI>Romans</HI>; and that the <HI>Latin</HI> was nei|ther generally nor
perfectly &s;poken in the <HI>Provinces.</HI> 5. <HI>Of the beginning of the
Italian, French, and Spani&s;h Languages</HI>; with the Ruin of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Empire, when, and by whom; and that Barbarous Nations were not
the fir&s;t Authors of tho&s;e degenerate Languages, but rather Promoters of
their Corruptions. 6. <HI>Objections touching the Extent of the Latin Tongue
an&s;wered;</HI> That it was never purely &s;poken in the foreign Provinces;
that there were great Changes in it; whereof, he concludes with a pregnant
Example from the In&s;cription upon that naval Column (they call it
<HI>Columnam Ro&s;tratam,</HI> being deck'd with the Beaks of Ships) in the
Capitol at <HI>Rome</HI>; which In&s;cription, tho' compo&s;ed not above 150
Years before the Tongue &s;hone in its full Lu&s;tre under <HI>Cicero,</HI> has
not one Word in it &s;pell'd like the later <HI>Latin</HI> that is &s;ubjoined:
An Example which may give the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue &s;ome Countenance,
tho' our Author does men|tion an In&s;tance or two al&s;o of its Mutability,
&s;ince it is in a far larger Compa&s;s of Years. 7. <HI>Of the Ancient
Languages of Italy, Spain, France, and Africa:</HI> That the <HI>Punics</HI> of
<HI>Afri|ca</HI> were originally <HI>Canaanites</HI> or <HI>Phoenicians,</HI>
and that the <HI>Punic</HI> Language was the old <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue; and
tho' that <HI>Punic</HI> Speech in <HI>Plautus,</HI> which is the only Specimen
of it extant, hath no great Affinity with the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> yet 'tis
im|puted to the Corruptions of Tran&s;cription. 8. <HI>Of the great Extent of
the Slavonic, Turki&s;h, and Arabic Tongues.</HI> 9. <HI>Of the Syriac and
Hebrew Tongues</HI>; the Beginning and Change of the <HI>Syriac</HI>; the
Difference of <HI>Hebrew</HI> from <HI>Chal|dee</HI> and <HI>Syriac</HI>; the
<HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Chaldee</HI> Tran&s;lations read in the Synagogues. 10.
<HI>Of the &s;undry Parts of the World in|habited by Chri&s;tians</HI>; that
<HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> were mingled with <HI>Mahometans</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI>;
the weak State of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> in <HI>A|frica</HI>; the Dimen&s;ions
of the Kingdom of <HI>Abe&s;&s;ia</HI>; the State of Chri&s;tianity in
<HI>A&s;ia,</HI> its Regions and I&s;lands; and its Declen&s;ion in the
<HI>Ea&s;t Parts</HI> thereof; with the Condi|tion of Chri&s;tianity in
<HI>America.</HI> 11. <HI>Of the Parts of the World po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
Mahumetans;</HI> the large Extent of <HI>Mahumeti&s;m</HI> in <HI>Africa</HI>
and in <HI>A&s;ia</HI>; and why &s;o mightily en|crea&s;ed. 
<PB N="161" REF="188"> 12. <HI>Of the &s;undry Regions in the World inhabited
by Idolaters</HI>; what Part of <HI>Africa</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them, and
what Parts of <HI>A&s;ia</HI>; their va&s;t Extent in <HI>America.</HI> 13.
<HI>Of the Jews di&s;per&s;ed in &s;everal Parts of the World;</HI> the State
of them in <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Africa. Tartars</HI> &s;u&s;pected
to be of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> Race: That <HI>Americans</HI> are the
Progeny of the <HI>Tartars</HI>: That many Nations are circumci&s;ed be&s;ides
the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> and therefore that Circumci&s;ion is no &s;ure Token
of De&s;cent from them: That the <HI>Tartarians</HI> are not the Offspring of
the <HI>I&s;raelites:</HI> That the &s;econd Book of <HI>E&s;|dras</HI>
contradicts the Scripture: That the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> departed not out of
the Dominion of <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI>: that <HI>Ar&s;areth</HI> was a feigned
Man&s;ion of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI>; and that their Voyage and remote
Retirement favours of the &s;ame <HI>Talmudisal</HI> Spirit with that other
Tale of the rea&s;on why God ap|pointed the Sea for the <HI>Whale,</HI> and the
Land for the <HI>Ele|phant,</HI> becau&s;e they were too big to be Inhabitants
together in either of tho&s;e Elements; whereupon we have a Digre&s;|&s;ion
upon the Dimen&s;ions of tho&s;e two Animals; the Deep|ne&s;s of the Sea, and
Height of Mountains; that the Sea is not higher than the Land, and the Depth of
the Sea more than the Height of the Mountains; the great Declivity of the Face
of the Land, and great Deepne&s;s of the Sea. 14. <HI>Of the Quantity and
Proportion of the Parts of the Earth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;everal Sorts
of the above-mentioned Religions</HI>; as, the Proportion of
<HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to <HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Idolaters</HI>; the va&s;t
greatne&s;s of the <HI>South</HI> Continent, and of the <HI>Antartic</HI>

Amba&s;|&s;adors</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> from the Year 1612, to the Year
1627, inclu&s;ive, was publi&s;hed after the Author's Death, from the
Manu&s;cript by his intimate Acquaintance, Mr. <HI>James Howell.</HI></P>
<P>The Editor, in his Dedication to <HI>Philip</HI> Lord Vi&s;count
<HI>Li&s;le,</HI> gives this Account of the Author: 
<Q REND="inline">"Among other Parts of Indu&s;try, which were known

by King <HI>James</HI> I. a|bout the Middle of his Reign, made A&s;&s;i&s;tant
to Sir <HI>Lewis Lewkner, Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies,</HI> in which Service he
acquitted him&s;elf with great Honour and Fidelity: whereupon King
<HI>Charles,</HI> after his Father's Death, not only continued him in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Place, but gave him a rever&s;ionary
Grant of the Office of <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Ceremo|nies</HI>; which came to his
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by the Death of Sir <HI>Lewis,</HI> 10th of <HI>March</HI>
1626. During his whole Service, he applied him&s;elf with great A&s;&s;iduity;
retiring only when Occa&s;ion would &s;erve, to his Country-hou&s;e at
<HI>Twittenham.</HI> It was his con&s;tant Maxim to give the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion
to, and avoid as much as po&s;&s;i|ble, the too nice Punctillios of
<HI>Procedence</HI> between Amba&s;&s;adors; which &s;eldom fail to breed
Animo&s;ities in their Sovereigns: And, by this means, he was not only much
e&s;teemed by the Amba&s;&s;adors, which turned greatly to his Advantage, with
regard to their u&s;ual Pre&s;ents; but he likewi&s;e prevented the Trouble
that wou'd have en&s;ued to his Maje&s;ty, of hearing their frivolous
Complaints. As to this Work, it was the Au|thor's Method, as appears by the
Editor's <HI>Dedication,</HI> to couch in Writing, what things pa&s;&s;ed in
his Province, not only for his own, but for the Information of others; and his
Notes were more than once, as appears by his own Words, produced to the Lord
<HI>Chamberlain</HI> to regulate by Precedents the Differences which happened
between Amba&s;&s;adors: And in one of his Ob|&s;ervations, <HI>page</HI> 129.
he &s;ays he does it, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>for future Occa&s;ions and U&s;e to the

<HI>that the&s;e Ob&s;ervations</HI> &s;hou'd be made publick; and to every one
in that Province, they may, no doubt, be of great U&s;e and In&s;truction. And
they may be of further and &s;till greater U&s;e, as well in illu&s;trating
&s;ome Parts of Mon&s;. <HI>Wiquefort,</HI> as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory
in that Period, well known to have &s;o much abounded in Emba&s;&s;ies, and in
the Particulars whereof our Hi|&s;torians of tho&s;e Times are very deficient,
not having had the Light of the&s;e Ob&s;ervations. <HI>Anthony Wood,</HI> who
informs us, that he lived to the Age of 70 Years, and died in 1641, yet gives
us no Account how long he remained in his Office, nor why he &s;o abruptly
di&s;continued his Ob&s;ervations. But we have heard there now is an original
or authentick MS. of them in being, which might give further Intelligence in
this Particular.</NOTE>."</Q></P>

Ju&s;tices of A&s;&s;ize and Goal-Delivery, with <HI>Diet,</HI> in their
re&s;pective Circuits. Thus, after a &s;hort <HI>Index</HI> to this fir&s;t
Part of the Book, we arrive at the la&s;t, by our Author, entitled,</P>
<P>CHRONICA SERIES <HI>Cancellariorum,</HI> &amp;c. In which u&s;eful
Tables of the &s;aid Lord Chancellors, Lord Trea&s;urers, Judges, Barons of the
Exchequer, Ma&s;ters of the Rolls, King's Attorneys and Sollicitors, and
Serjeants at Law, from the beginning of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror,
<HI>Anno</HI> 1067, in di&s;tinct Columns, parallel with each other, down (in
this la&s;t Edition) to the Year 1680, may be &s;een, in one View, as our
Author ob&s;erves, 
<Q REND="inline">"how the famous Men for Know|ledge in our Laws
&s;tood Contemporary thro' all Ages &s;ince the Conque&s;t; al&s;o, what great

common Mi&s;takes among young Students, in reading the ancient
<HI>Year-Books,</HI> where they are apt to mi&s;take the <HI>Judge</HI> for the
<HI>Pleader,</HI> and the <HI>Abbreviations</HI> of Judges <HI>Names</HI> for
their proper and perfect Appellations."</Q> Our Author was at the Expence of
Engraving the Heads or Effigies of &s;ome of the Chancellors and Judges,
men|tioned in the&s;e Tables; but they are differently bound up, &s;ometimes
before, &s;ometimes after them, and &s;ometimes inter&s;per&s;ed in the
Chronology, again&s;t the Pages where their Creations are mentioned. The&s;e
Heads are tho&s;e of Sir <HI>John Clench,</HI> etch'd by <HI>Hollar;</HI> Sir

the beginning thereof; and fur|ther, which are not in the fir&s;t Edition, Sir
<HI>Orlando Bridg|man,</HI> graved by <HI>Faithorne,</HI> which is in the
&s;econd and la&s;t Editions; and Sir <HI>John Vaughan,</HI> by <HI>White,</HI>
which is only in this la&s;t. So that the la&s;t Edition has, with Mr.
<HI>Selden</HI>'s Head before mentioned, three Cuts more than the fir&s;t: 
<PB N="174" REF="201"> But tho&s;e in that, are, as mu&s;t be expected, of more
lively and perfect Impre&s;&s;ion. At the End of the&s;e <HI>Tables,</HI> we
have, in one Page, a Continuation of the Catalogues of the <HI>Readers</HI> and
<HI>Trea&s;urers</HI> of the <HI>Inner Temple, Middle Temple,
Lincoln's-Inn,</HI> and <HI>Gray's-Inn</HI>; which &s;hould have followed at
the end of tho&s;e Catalogues, in their re&s;pective Places, had what
pa&s;&s;es for this la&s;t Edition been entirely reprinted, but except the
Title-Page at the beginning of the Book, and three Leaves at the end,
continuing the Chro|nology, and Catalogues afore&s;aid, 'tis the &s;ame with
the &s;econd Impre&s;&s;ion, and they are &s;o much wor&s;e than the fir&s;t,
by how much the <HI>Errata</HI> of the Pre&s;s in them are more numerous;
however, this la&s;t Edition &s;ells in the Shops, &s;ometimes, for as much
again as the fir&s;t. And this is all we have here to remark of this Book, from
our pre|&s;ent Review of it, and the Opportunity we have had of collating the
&s;everal Editions: What others have ob&s;erved, we refer to below<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the&s;e Editions we &s;hall only add, That the <HI>fir&s;t</HI>

curious and in&s;tructive Matter, &s;o various in its kinds, yet connected by
&s;uch ea&s;y Tran&s;i|tions, and &s;upported by &s;uch pertinent Parallels, as
have rendered it of a more general or comprehen&s;ive Nature; &s;o as to become
a Pattern, tho' &s;carcely equal'd, to &s;everal <HI>Writers,</HI> who have
attempted the Illu&s;tration of other Coun|ties in the like manner, and may

<P>It is dedicated by the Author to King <HI>James,</HI> becau&s;e of
the Approbation his Maje&s;ty had &s;hewn to his <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of
<HI>Oxford</HI>; and after his &s;hort <HI>Preface,</HI> we have the
<HI>Ver&s;es</HI> of <HI>T. Lane</HI> to the &s;aid King <HI>James</HI> II.
upon occa&s;ion of the Author's pre&s;enting him this Work: Al&s;o others to

<P>As to his Method; that which he formerly pre&s;cribed him&s;elf in

the &s;ame here; whereby the whole Work is divided into <HI>Ten Chapters</HI>;
which are inter&s;per&s;ed with <HI>thirty-&s;even</HI> Copper <HI>Prints</HI>
of the chief <HI>Seats</HI> and <HI>Views, Curio&s;ities</HI> of

<HI>Moorland</HI> Inhabitants upon the <HI>Sun-&s;et,</HI> in the Summer
Sol&s;tice; al&s;o the <HI>Mock-Suns</HI> frequent in this County. Remarkable
<HI>Rainbows,</HI> as, of the Moon, and <HI>Halo's</HI> of the Sun. Strange
Effects of <HI>Thunder</HI> and <HI>Lightning</HI>; with an elaborate
Digre&s;&s;ion upon <HI>Fairy Circles</HI>; which tho' he indulges &s;o far the
Accounts of <HI>Remigius</HI> and others, who impute the <HI>&s;ame</HI> to
Wizards and Witches, as to recite them; yet, at la&s;t, more pro|bably imputes
them to Lightning. Then we come to his Re|marks on Animals, e&s;pecially on the
mortal Effects of <HI>Thun|der</HI> upon Crevices and Lob&s;ters. Several

on human Bodies. And, among many other Ob&s;ervations, &s;ome on Unction and
Painting of the Body, to prevent the Depre|dations thereof, from <HI>Roger
Bacon.</HI> The Choice of healthy Situations, with many Examples; which brings
him to the Con&s;ideration of <HI>Waters,</HI> by which the Air is &s;o much
af|fected. Several Remarks on the pure Streams and <HI>Waters</HI> of
<HI>common U&s;e</HI> in this County, and particularly the refre&s;h|ing Pool
of <HI>Madely,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Gerva&s;e</HI> of <HI>Tilbury.</HI>
In|&s;tances of Health in the <HI>Moorlands,</HI> from the Age of twelve

King's-Evil; &s;ome good for the Eyes; and &s;ome of noxious Quality, as the
Coal-pit Waters which kill the Fi&s;h of tho&s;e Rivers into which they
fall.</P>
<P>Chap. III. <HI>Of the Earths.</HI> This begins with the Situa|tion
of the County, Nature, and Fertility of the Soil. K. <HI>James</HI> his
&s;aying of it for the Firmne&s;s of the Highways. A Remark upon &s;ome
Pa&s;tures, which tinged the Teeth of Cattle, of a Golden Colour; and upon

Stones</HI> <PB N="178" REF="205"> near <HI>Weeford,</HI> why &s;o called. Then
we come to the <HI>Iron</HI> Ore, with the melting and working it; al&s;o the
<HI>Copper</HI> Ores, and their Works; then to the <HI>Lead</HI> Ores, where we
have an Account of a Leaden Coffin that &s;wam in nine In|ches Water, with the
<HI>hydro&s;tatical</HI> Rea&s;on for it. Hence we come to the

different kind from any yet de&s;cribed, who&s;e unaccountable Quality of
moving towards one another in Vinegar is here ob&s;erved to have been known 400
Years &s;ince, by the learned <HI>Roger Bacon.</HI> He &s;peaks next of the
<HI>Thunder Stones,</HI> as they are commonly called, found in tho&s;e Parts,
and others repre&s;enting the Parts of Birds; <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Stones; a
kind of <HI>Honeycomb</HI> Stones, full of &s;weeti&s;h Liquor; many Stones
re&s;embling <HI>Sea Fi&s;hes,</HI> e&s;pecially of the <HI>te&s;taceous</HI>

<P>Chap. VI. <HI>Of Plants.</HI> Among which, none &s;o remarkable
for re&s;embling certain Parts of the human Body, as the <HI>Fungus
Phalloides,</HI> or <HI>Phallus Hollandicus</HI> of <HI>Hadr. Junius.</HI>
After &s;everal uncommon Ob&s;ervations among the <HI>herba|ccous</HI> Kind, he
advances to &s;ome unde&s;cribed <HI>Shrubs</HI>; as the <HI>White-Berried

Trees, &s;ome of extraordinary &s;peedy Growth. <PB N="179" REF="206">
<HI>Oaks</HI> of va&s;t Bulk and exten&s;ive Shade; more particularly Sir
<HI>Harvey Bagot</HI>'s <HI>Witch-Elm,</HI> growing at <HI>Field,</HI> within
Me|mory; which was 120 Foot long, 17 Yards round at the Bottom, had 14 Load of
Fire-Wood broke off in the Fall, 47 Load more of Fire-Wood cut from the Top,
8000 Foot of <HI>Plank,</HI> 80 Pair of <HI>Naves, &amp;c.</HI> in &s;hort
computed to contain 96 Tons of Timber, after their Country way of reckoning;
but, according to our Author, at lea&s;t 100 Ton of neat Timber. With this is
mentioned, as what might equal it in Height, the Oak which yielded a Plank
above 25 Yards long, and near one Yard broad, of which was made the Table at
<HI>Dudley</HI> Ca&s;tle. From this we are led to the tall <HI>Firrs</HI> at
<HI>Norbury</HI>; one of which was 47 Yards high; and thence, to what is
ob&s;ervable in the <HI>Roots</HI> of Trees, as their embracing and lifting up
great Stones; Trees of dif|ferent Species uniting at the Roots, or in the
Trunks, and &s;ome Trees growing out of the Bodies and Heads of others; but
above all, tho&s;e found buried under Ground in all Countries, are reckoned
mo&s;t unaccountable. Here we have an elaborate Di&s;&s;ertation upon tho&s;e
<HI>&s;ubterraneous Trees,</HI> by &s;ome call'd <HI>Mo&s;s-wood,</HI> with the
Cau&s;e of Mo&s;&s;es, &s;ink|ing of Hills, and rai&s;ing of Valleys. Hence we
pa&s;s to the in|ternal Notice of what was mo&s;t uncommon in Trees; as the
<HI>Cylindraceous</HI> Cavities in an old Crab Tree here de&s;cribed, with the
Cau&s;e; leading us to the &s;trange Di&s;covery of Ani|mals in the Bodies of
Trees, as <HI>Field Mice,</HI> which are &s;u|per&s;titiou&s;ly pegg'd up by
the Country People here, to make <HI>Nur&s;row</HI> Trees, as they call them,
to cure Swellings in their Cattle; and other In&s;tances of their
Super&s;tition, in the Wood of the <HI>Quicken</HI> Tree, for walking Staves.
Here end|ing his Remarks on <HI>Whole Trees,</HI> and their <HI>Trunks,</HI>
with an Ob&s;ervation, that the Timber of this County is gene|rally large and
good, particularly the Woods in the Park of <HI>John Offley,</HI>
<ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> whereof 1000 Trees might be cho&s;en worth 8000 Pounds, and
of the&s;e 100 worth 1500 Pounds; he proceeds to unu&s;ual Accidents in the
<HI>Branches, Fruits,</HI> and <HI>Leaves</HI> of Trees; upon which la&s;t he
accounts for the <HI>Excre&s;cences</HI> by In&s;ects, and the
<HI>Variegations</HI> or Stripings in <HI>Hollys, Maples, A&s;hes,</HI> and
<HI>Oaks</HI> he met with. From thence pa&s;&s;es to <HI>Fruit Trees,</HI> as
the large <HI>&s;preading Apple Tree</HI> at <HI>Leigh,</HI> having borne 50
Strike of Apples in a Year; <HI>Pear Trees</HI> blo&s;&s;oming at

<HI>Wil|lughby</HI> and <HI>Ray</HI> to be <HI>indaginae</HI> of this County,
or have had extraordinary Accidents attending them. And fir&s;t he be|gins with
<HI>Birds</HI>; among the&s;e he reckons a kind of Goo&s;e|legg'd

Brambling, Gro&s;s-beak, Heron,</HI> and great <HI>Loon:</HI> but mo&s;t
remarkable is his Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Pewits,</HI> and their breeding only
upon the E&s;tate of Sir <HI>Charles Skrym&s;her,</HI> at the old
<HI>Pewit-Pool</HI> in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Norbury,</HI> and
<HI>Shebben-Pool</HI> in the Pari&s;h of <HI>High-Offley</HI>; where they
encrea&s;ed in &s;uch abundance, that 50 Dozen has been taken at a Dri|ving;
which, at five Shillings a Dozen, the ancient Price, comes to twelve Pounds ten
Shillings; but &s;ome Years the Profit of them has amounted to fifty or
three&s;core Pounds: and we have here a Repre&s;entation, in Sculpture, of
<HI>Shebben-Pool,</HI> with the manner of driving and taking the&s;e Birds.
Next he ob&s;erves what has been extraordinary in the Co|lours, Limbs, Eggs,
and Time of Production among Birds; as <HI>Popinjays, Crows,</HI> and
<HI>Sparrows</HI> that were white; Cro&s;s-bill'd <HI>Ravens</HI>; a

Opinions of <HI>Fabricius</HI> and Dr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> that &s;uch Deformities
ari&s;e from <HI>double yolked Eggs,</HI> &amp;c. Next we have Ob&s;ervations
upon white yolked <HI>Eggs,</HI> and Eggs all Yolk. Of <HI>Hens</HI> and
<HI>Ducks,</HI> that laid at the rate of three Eggs a Day, and of Birds
hatching in the Winter. Then we come to flying In&s;ects, as the winged

<HI>viviparous</HI> In&s;ects, <HI>Spiders,</HI> and their Webs, with &s;ome
<HI>aquatic</HI> In&s;ects, unde|&s;cribed; which leads to <HI>Fi&s;hes,</HI>
and his Account of the <HI>Burbot</HI> or <HI>Bird-bolt,</HI> not before, or
not well de&s;cribed. Of Fi&s;hes found in unu&s;ual Places. Of the uncommon
Nature of <HI>Eels,</HI> that they are <HI>viviparous,</HI> travel from one

as a Half-Crown: <HI>Jacks</HI> a Yard and half long. Thus pa&s;&s;ing from the
Water to the Land Animals, he begins with the <HI>Toad,</HI> and how
&s;trangely &s;ome have been found excluded from both Elements in the mid&s;t
of &s;olid Blocks of Stone, and in the Bodies of &s;ound Trees. Then we have an
Account of an unde&s;cribed Land <HI>Lizard,</HI> a &s;trange toothed

to the <HI>Younge&s;t</HI> before the <HI>Elde&s;t</HI> born, with the Rea&s;on
pre&s;umed to be, that where this Cu&s;tom remains, the Places were anciently
liable to the Privilege granted al&s;o in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by King
<HI>Evenus</HI> or <HI>Eugenius,</HI> to the <HI>Lords</HI> of
<HI>Mannors,</HI> that they &s;hould have the fir&s;t Night's Lodging with
their <HI>Tenants</HI> Brides; &s;o that <HI>elde&s;t</HI> Sons being
&s;uppo&s;ed all <HI>Ba&s;tards,</HI> and of the Lord's beget|ting, they
&s;ettled their Lands on the <HI>Younge&s;t,</HI> as more likely to be their
own: But how common this Cu&s;tom was all over <HI>England,</HI> may be &s;een
by the Tax afterwards gathered in&s;tead thereof, called <HI>Marcheta
Mulierum,</HI> in <HI>Bracton.</HI> Nor was the Privilege of
<HI>Lotherwits</HI> or <HI>Lierwit,</HI> expounded <PB N="182" REF="209"> in
<HI>Fleta,</HI> to import the &s;ame as <HI>Mulcta Adulteriorum,</HI> and
remaining here to this day, much le&s;s lewd or immoral, being a Liberty of
taking a Compen&s;ation for Ba&s;tards, got or born in the Lord&s;hip, nay
al&s;o out of the Lord&s;hip for 1 <HI>l.</HI> 19. <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI>
paid to the <HI>Lords</HI>; and further, here was an <HI>Oak</HI> in
<HI>Knoll-Wood,</HI> which had &s;uch a &s;uperior Privilege of
<HI>Fornication,</HI> that if a Ba&s;tard was &s;worn to be begot under its
Shade, neither the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> nor <HI>Lords</HI> of the <HI>Mannor</HI>
them|&s;elves could take any Cognizance of it. After the&s;e Births, we have
&s;ome Remarks upon <HI>Chri&s;tnings,</HI> or <HI>Chri&s;tian Names,</HI> how
they ran much upon <HI>Ralph</HI> and <HI>Walter,</HI> from two famous Earls
who lived in the County; and how &s;ome Families chri&s;tned their elde&s;t
Sons of the &s;ame Name for many Generations. Having done with the Births of
In|fants, he proceeds to remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Childhood</HI> and
<HI>Youth,</HI> as the Impo&s;tures of <HI>William Perry,</HI> the Boy of
<HI>Bil|&s;on,</HI> who counterfeited him&s;elf bewitched or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed;
whereof there is a Pamphlet printed in 1622. And this Story brings in other
In&s;tances of <HI>imitating Sounds</HI> and <HI>Motions,</HI> whereof the
<HI>involuntary Imitations</HI> of <HI>Donald Monro,</HI> are mo&s;t &s;trange.
Next we advance to uncom|mon Accidents and Qualities in adult Per&s;ons, and
fir&s;t of Women. Some who yielded great Quantities of <HI>Milk,</HI> and the
medicinal Virtues of Women's Milk. One who <HI>&s;lept</HI> 14 Days and Nights;
and another 7 Days. A Man who <HI>fa&s;ted</HI> 14 Days; and another in
<HI>Scotland</HI> 30 or 40 Days to|gether. And here is a Copy from a

forty Days without Meat or Drink, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of <HI>deaf</HI> Per&s;ons
under&s;tanding People by the Motion of their Lips. Of a Lady who had a Pin
&s;queezed out of her Arm, which &s;he never could account for, yet parallel'd
with like In&s;tances. Of &s;trange Deliverances from <HI>Murder</HI> and

hang'd from nine a-Clock on <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, till Sun-ri&s;ing on
<HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> according to the Sen|tence pa&s;&s;ed, yet lived after it,
and had a Pardon thereupon granted, 48th <HI>Hen.</HI> III. which is here
recited. And of a <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> who was hanged 13 times, yet could not by
that kind of Execution be put to death. Next we come to Men eminent for their
extraordinary <HI>Strength,</HI> exce&s;&s;ive <HI>Stature,</HI> and <HI>Pious
Works;</HI> others who had their want of <HI>Sight</HI> wonderfully &s;upply'd
by the Perfection of their other <PB N="183" REF="210"> Sen&s;es; &s;trange
In&s;tances of <HI>Longing</HI> in Men, as well as Women; and other uncommon
Di&s;tempers. Of Men that never <HI>&s;pit.</HI> The &s;trange Force of
<HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> in &s;ome <HI>Fools,</HI> e&s;pecially one, who being removed
from a Place where he had heard a Clock con&s;tantly &s;trike, would repeat the
Strokes punctually every Hour when he heard it not; and of the
<HI>Artificial,</HI> learn'd to become a <HI>Natural</HI> Clock, as Dr.
<HI>Willis</HI> has related. Here is another In&s;tance of a <HI>Fool,</HI>
who&s;e &s;trange Sagacity exceeded the other telling not only the Changes of
the Moon, Times of Eclip&s;es, and when <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> and
<HI>Whit&s;untide</HI> fell, or any other <HI>moveable</HI> Fea&s;t, but at
what time they had, or &s;hould fall, at any di&s;|tance of Years, which could
receive no Help from the <HI>Force</HI> of <HI>Cu&s;tom:</HI> From the
Imperfections of Men, we have a Tran&s;ition to their <HI>Vices,</HI> which
brings in the dread|ful Judgment upon <HI>John Duncalf,</HI> who having &s;tole
a Bible, had his Hands rotted off, according to his Wi&s;h, if that Theft were
true; from the <HI>Narrative</HI> of this Judgment pub|li&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Ja.
Illingworth</HI> and Mr. <HI>Newey.</HI> This is followed with &s;ome wonderful
E&s;capes from <HI>Death</HI> in this County, particularly that of King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. after the Bat|tle of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> who found an
<HI>A&s;ylum</HI> at <HI>Bentley,</HI> and afterwards conferred &s;everal
Honours on Col. <HI>John Lane,</HI> as the <HI>Letters Patent</HI> here
exemplified, concerning the &s;ame, do te&s;tify. Here is likewi&s;e an Account
of the Pre&s;ervation of his Followers; and by who&s;e means his Maje&s;ty's
<HI>George</HI> came &s;afe again to his Hands. From Men &s;olitarily
con|&s;idered, we proceed to &s;ome Remarks upon them jointly, in Examples of
Men extremely alike, or <HI>re&s;embling</HI> each other, particularly Dr.
<HI>Hen. Fairfax</HI> and his Brother. Of Bi&s;hops twice married. Remarks on
many Families of one Name, and marrying among them&s;elves. Of &s;ome odd

<P>Chap. IX. <HI>Of Arts.</HI> The&s;e are treated of after his
former Method; fir&s;t, of &s;uch as relate to the <HI>Heavens</HI> and

to the Im|provement of <HI>Earths, Stones,</HI> or <HI>Plants,</HI> and
la&s;tly, re|&s;pecting <HI>Men</HI> or <HI>Women.</HI> To this purpo&s;e he
begins with an Account of a new Sort of <HI>Dyals,</HI> and a <HI>Dyal
Quadrant;</HI> with an Experiment proving the Force of the Rarefaction of
<HI>Air.</HI> The <HI>Arts</HI> relating to <HI>Fire</HI> are, tho&s;e of
burning <HI>Turf, Earth,</HI> &amp;c. for the fertilizing of Lands, and for
cer|tain <HI>Iron-works,</HI> at the Anvil and Forge; particularly of the
Difficulty and Ingenuity of making Frying-pans and that there were but two
Ma&s;ters of this Craft in the Kingdom. An improved Way of burning
<HI>Tiles.</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s Dex|terity in &s;hooting with
<HI>Fire-Arms,</HI> exemplified in the two famous Shots he made
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively, thro' the Weather-cock of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s
Church-Steeple, at <HI>Stafford,</HI> with a &s;crew'd Hor&s;eman's Pi&s;tol,
at three&s;core Yards di&s;tance, before King <HI>Charles</HI> I. Among the
<HI>Water-works,</HI> we have &s;ome Account of remarkable <HI>Mills,</HI> and
<HI>Mill-dams</HI>; of Brewing and Fining of <HI>Ale</HI>; and in the
Plea&s;ure-Gardens, of <HI>Foun|tains, Canals,</HI> &amp;c. Of Arts relating to

To the&s;e are added, &s;ome old Cu&s;toms, who&s;e Originals being ob&s;cure,
might commence as high as tho&s;e Times: &s;uch as the Ser|vice of the Lord of

the Coals. Their merry Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Hobbey-Hor&s;e Dance,</HI> &amp;c.
at <HI>Abbots Bromley</HI> had a good u&s;eful End in it; but the Cu&s;|tom at

Mu&s;icians in the &s;aid Franchi&s;e, who refu&s;ed to do the yearly Services,
according to the Charter of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> for which they had
a Bull, given by the Prior of <HI>Tutbury,</HI> amid&s;t all the Harmony
thereof, &s;eems to have been at|tended with much Di&s;cord, which produced an
Alteration according to the modern Ceremonies u&s;ed in the&s;e their mu&s;ical
Meetings, which yet are not void of Tumult and Mi&s;chief. That other Cu&s;tom
at <HI>Tutbury,</HI> of finding a <HI>Flitch of Bacon</HI> for every married
Man, who took the Oath a Year and a Day after his Marriage, That he had never
wi&s;hed to change his Wife, but would have taken her be|fore all other Women
had &s;he been &s;ingle; whereby Sir <HI>Philip de Somervile</HI> held
<HI>Whichnovre,</HI> and other Manors; had a good Encouragement in it to the
making of mature Elections, and being contented with tho&s;e they made; and was

<HI>Langbain</HI>'s noble De&s;ign of publi&s;h|ing divers Volumes of

<P>THO' Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI> &s;uffer'd Death for maintaining the
Supremacy of the Pope over that of his Sovereign, as may be read in the&s;e
<HI>Works,</HI> and in the many Accounts of his <HI>Life,</HI> &s;et forth by
the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholics, who have much magnified him for his &s;aid
Writings and Sufferings; yet are there many things in this Collection of his
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Works ob&s;ervable to all Readers, who are even not attach'd
to his own Per&s;ua&s;ion, as it is one of the mo&s;t copious Ex|emplars we
have in Print of the be&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stile in tho&s;e Days, and
contains &s;ome curious Pieces or Parcels of <HI>Civil,</HI> and many of
<HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Hi&s;tory, relating to the Times of our
<HI>Reformation:</HI> and, overlooking the &s;uper&s;titious Adhe|rence to his
Cau&s;e, with &s;ome &s;ophi&s;tical Arguments ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upport it,
is fraught with many Te&s;timonies of virtuous Learning, fine Genius, and good
Morals for the univer&s;al Conduct of Life.</P>
<P>The Book was collected together and publi&s;hed from the Author's
printed Copies and Manu&s;cripts, by his Nephew <HI>William Ra&s;tell,</HI>
Serjeant at Law, and dedicated to Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; that it might forward
her Maje&s;ty's <HI>mo&s;t</HI> Godly <HI>Pu&s;po&s;e, in purging this her
Realm of all wicked Here&s;ies.</HI></P>
<P>After the Table of Contents, and a tolerable good In|dex, the
Collection commences with &s;ome Pieces of our Author's Poetry, which he wrote
for his Diver&s;ion, in his younger Days. As, the Merry <HI>Je&s;t,</HI> how a
<HI>Serjeant</HI> would learn to play the <HI>Frier</HI>; containing &s;ome
good Reproofs of tho&s;e who act out of their Sphere. Then follow his
<HI>Ver&s;es</HI> to explain the <HI>Images</HI> in &s;ome <HI>Pageants,</HI>
which he devi&s;ed in his Father's Hou&s;e; de&s;cribing the &s;everal Stages
and Con&s;equents of Life. After this, we have his rueful <HI>La|mentation of
the Death of Queen Elizabeth,</HI> Wife of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. in
<HI>Feb.</HI> 1503. Next come his Prefatory Ver&s;es before the <HI>Book of
Fortune:</HI> The&s;e Ver&s;es make about four <PB N="195" REF="222"> Sheets.
Hence we pa&s;s to his Works in Pro&s;e; beginning with <HI>the Life of John
Picus, Earl of Mirandula, an Ita|lian Nobleman,</HI> of great Virtue and
Learning, who died in 1494, aged 32; with &s;everal of his Letters, and his
Ver|&s;es, tran&s;lated from the <HI>Latin,</HI> and dedicated to his beloved
Si&s;ter <HI>Joyeuce Leigh.</HI> After this, we have <HI>the Hi&s;tory of King
Richard</HI> III. written by our Author when he was one of the Under Sheriffs
of <HI>London,</HI> about the Year 1513, but unfini&s;hed, and publi&s;hed
before, in the <HI>Chronicles</HI> of <HI>Harding</HI> and <HI>Hall</HI>; tho'
very corruptly, and much varying from his own Copy whence this is printed. The
next is a long Treati&s;e <HI>on the four la&s;t Things,</HI> Death, Dome,
Pain, and Joy; with &s;everal Chapters on Pride, Envy, Wrath, Covetou&s;ne&s;s,
Gluttony, and Slouth; compo&s;ed after he was knighted, of the Privy Council to
King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and Under-Trea&s;urer of <HI>England,</HI> about the
Year 1522, but unfini&s;h'd, and we pre&s;ume never before printed; but that
which &s;ucceeds, it was as we are informed, the Year after it was written;
entitled, A <HI>Dialogue</HI> of Sir <HI>T. More,</HI> then Chancellor of the
Dutchy of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> wherein is treated <HI>of the Veneration and
Wor&s;hip of Images</HI> and <HI>Reliques</HI>; praying to <HI>Saints,</HI> and
going on <HI>Pilgrimage,</HI> with many things touching the Sects of
<HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Tyndale,</HI> begun by the one in <HI>Saxony,</HI> and
labour'd to be brought by the other into <HI>England</HI>; made in the Year
1528. This is a large Trea|ti&s;e, in four Books, divided into many Chapters,
and illu&s;|trated with many plea&s;ant Examples, Tales, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with
which he had a Memory plentifully furni&s;hed, and a Ta|lent happily
con&s;tituted to apply them. To &s;ome, who made Objection thereat, we find his
An&s;wer was, 
<Q REND="inline">"That for a Layman to tell his Mind merrily, might
&s;ometimes better become him, than &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;olemnly to
preach."</Q> His next Treati&s;e is, <HI>The Supplication of Souls,</HI>
written 1529, again&s;t a famous little Tract, call'd, <HI>The Supplication of
Beggars;</HI> (written by <HI>Simon Fi&s;h</HI> of <HI>Gray's-Inn,</HI> which
was very In&s;trumental to the Reformation, and is reprinted in <HI>Fox.</HI>)
To that follows, <HI>The Confutation of Tyndale's An|&s;wer,</HI> (to the
<HI>Dialogue</HI> afore&s;aid) made 1532, by our Au|thor. In the Preface
hereof, we have a large Account of many late Books, and their Authors, whom Sir
<HI>Thomas</HI> calls <HI>Heretics.</HI> Then we come to <HI>Tyndale</HI>'s
Preface, divided, with our Author's An&s;wers to the &s;everal Particulars
alter|nately; which ends the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Book: but the <HI>fir&s;t
Part</HI> of the Work contains 3 Books. The <HI>&s;econd Part,</HI> written
1533, <PB N="196" REF="223"> after he had given over his Chancellor's Office,
begins at the fourth Book: It contains <HI>Tyndale</HI>'s <HI>Defence</HI> for
his <HI>Tran&s;|lation</HI> of the <HI>Te&s;tament</HI>; with our Author's
<HI>An&s;wers</HI> to the &s;everal Parts interfering, as before; and herein,
having con&s;ider'd <HI>Tyndale</HI>'s Church, to the End of the
<HI>&s;eventh</HI> Book, we come in the <HI>eight,</HI> to our Author's
Confutation of <HI>Barnes</HI> his Church in the &s;ame manner: The
<HI>ninth</HI> Book is a Summary of the re&s;t, was not printed before, and
appears at the End to have been left unfini&s;hed. This Work is &s;ucceeded by
<HI>a Letter</HI> of our Author, written at <HI>Chelchith</HI> (or
<HI>Chel&s;ea</HI>) in 1533, <HI>again&s;t the little Book of John Frith upon
the Sacrament</HI>; and both concluded with a long <HI>Apology,</HI> written
and publi&s;hed al&s;o the &s;ame Year, in An&s;wer to the Objections which
were made, more e&s;|pecially to the&s;e his la&s;t Writings, again&s;t his
&s;aid three An|tagoni&s;ts. The&s;e Pieces of his, producing a large
Treati&s;e again&s;t him, call'd, <HI>Salem and Bizance,</HI> he writ the
&s;ame Year his <HI>Debellacion of Salem and Bizance.</HI> The &s;ame Year he
wrote his <HI>An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Part of the Poi&s;oned Book, which a
namele&s;s Heretic named the Supper of the Lord.</HI> His Po&s;t&s;cript to
this Treati&s;e ends with this Allu|&s;ion; 
<Q REND="inline">"Of all my Adver&s;aries, could I never hitherto
find any one, but when he catcheth once a Fall, as each of them hath caught
full many, there lyeth he, &s;till tumb|ling and toltring in Mire, and neither
Spur, nor Bridle can one Inch prevail, but, as tho' they were not fall'n in a
Puddle of Dirt, but rubbed and laid in Litter under the Manger, at their
Ea&s;e, they whine, and they bite, and they kick, and they &s;purn at him that
would help them up."</Q> His next Performance is entitled, <HI>A Dialogue of
Comfort again&s;t Tribulation,</HI> made by an <HI>Hungarian</HI> in
<HI>La|tin,</HI> and tran&s;lated out of <HI>Latin</HI> into <HI>French,</HI>
and out of <HI>French</HI> into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in 1534, when he was
Pri&s;oner in the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London.</HI> And this is followed with
<HI>a Treati&s;e to receive the Ble&s;&s;ed Body of our Lord &s;acramentally
and ver|tually both,</HI> written in the &s;ame Year and Place. The next is, a
<HI>Treati&s;e Hi&s;torical, containing the bitter Pa&s;&s;ion of our Saviour
Chri&s;t, after the Cour&s;e and Order of the four Evangeli&s;ts</HI>; with an
Expo&s;ition upon their Words, taken mo&s;tly out of the Sayings of &s;undry
good old holy Doctors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This copious Treati&s;e was al&s;o
written in the &s;ame Year and Place afore&s;aid; 'tis mo&s;tly taken from
<HI>John Ger&s;on's Monate&s;&s;eron</HI>; but is unfini&s;hed, the Author now
being denied the U&s;e of Books, Pens, Ink, and Paper. <PB N="197" REF="224">
Yet here follows, <HI>His Godly In&s;tructions, Meditations, and Prayers,</HI>
in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> written with a Coal, both before and
after his Condemnation, which was on <HI>Thur&s;|day</HI> the fir&s;t of
<HI>July,</HI> 1535, <HI>Anno</HI> 27 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and he was
<HI>beheaded</HI> on <HI>Tower-Hill</HI> the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> following. The
re&s;t of the Volume con&s;i&s;ts of his <HI>Letters,</HI> &amp;c. written at
&s;undry times on divers Occa&s;ions, beginning with his Letter from the Court
at <HI>Wood&s;tock,</HI> to his Wife the Lady <HI>Alice</HI> at
<HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> in 1528, the Year before he was Lord Chancel|lor,
containing Con&s;olations to her for the Lo&s;s &s;he had there by Fire. Next
we have his Epitaph, written by him|&s;elf in <HI>Latin,</HI> in 1532, &s;oon
after he had laid down his Chan|cellor's Office; which he cau&s;ed to be
in&s;cribed upon his Tomb, which he had erected in <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> Church,
while he was Lord Chancellor; with a Tran&s;lation of it. Then follow four
Letters which he wrote after he had given over the Office of Chancellor, and
before he was impri&s;on'd, <HI>viz.</HI> Three to Mr <HI>Tho. Cromwell</HI> of
the King's Privy Coun|cil, and one to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. all in the Year
1533. Next we have his Letters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wrote while he was Pri|&s;oner
in the <HI>Tower,</HI> beginning with his Letter to his elde&s;t Daughter Mrs.
<HI>Margaret Roper,</HI> upon his refu&s;ing the Oath. Another to his &s;aid
Daughter, written with a Coal. His <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to a Letter of hers, which
&s;eemingly per&s;uaded him to take the Oath, that &s;he might get the Liberty
&s;he did obtain of Acce&s;s to him. Her An&s;wer thereunto. His Letter to all
his Friends, written with a Coal; with two Stanza's upon Fortune. Lady
<HI>Alice Alington</HI>'s Letter to Mrs. <HI>Margaret Roper.</HI> A long
An&s;wer by her or her Fa|ther to the &s;ame. His two Letters to Doctor
<HI>Nicholas Wil&s;on,</HI> al&s;o Pri&s;oner in the <HI>Tower,</HI> 1534. His
Daughter <HI>Roper</HI>'s An&s;wer to a Letter of his, when he was &s;hut up
clo&s;e Pri&s;oner, 1534; with his An&s;wers both to the &s;ame and another
&s;he had &s;ent him. His Letter to Mr. <HI>Leder,</HI> a virtuous Prie&s;t,
the &s;ame Year. Two more of his Letters to his Daughter in 1535. His
<HI>Latin</HI> Epi&s;tle to Mr. <HI>An|thony Bonuy&s;e,</HI> Merchant of
<HI>Luca,</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> his old Friend, written with a Coal the
&s;ame Year: with the Tran&s;lation. His la&s;t Letter was to his Daughter

de&s;ires to be re|commended to the Prayers of her, and his other Friends and

<P>After a Table of near &s;eventy Authors u&s;ed in this little
Work, our learned Antiquary begins it, with his Notice of the Promi&s;e he had
made to his Corre&s;pondent afore&s;aid, of &s;ending him the Geographical
De&s;cription of <HI>Britain,</HI> with the mo&s;t ancient Names, as well
<HI>Latin</HI> as <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>; wherein, becau&s;e he finds he mu&s;t
di&s;agree from the Opinions of others, he has thought it expedient, fir&s;t,
in a few Words, to di&s;clo&s;e the Effect of his Purpo&s;e, and by what
Arguments and Authorities he is moved to change or a&s;cribe to others, the
Names of &s;ome Countries, Towns, Rivers, and other Places. But before he takes
this in hand, enters upon &s;ome Explana|tion of the <HI>Briti&s;h Tongue,</HI>
touching the &s;ignification of the Letters, and manner of pronouncing the
&s;ame: The Igno|rance of which Tongue having driven many notable Men to &s;uch
&s;hifts, that endeavouring to wind them&s;elves out of one, they have fallen
into many. After this he begins with the <HI>Etymologies</HI> of
<HI>Britain</HI>; &s;hews their Errors who have darken'd all the Names of
Places and Men with tho&s;e of <HI>Latin</HI> De|rivation; whereof <HI>Robert
Coenalis</HI> is particularly arraign'd; &s;o proceeds to confirm Sir
<HI>Thomas Eliot</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation out of an old Manu&s;cript that
<HI>Britain</HI> was anciently written <HI>Prytannia,</HI> as if it were
derived from <HI>Pryd</HI> &s;ignifying Come|line&s;s or <HI>Beauty,</HI> and
<HI>Cain,</HI> or <HI>White,</HI> with the fir&s;t Letter &s;unk for
&s;moothne&s;s in Conjunction. After this he takes <PB N="200" REF="227">
occa&s;ion to cha&s;ti&s;e <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> the <HI>Italian,</HI> and
<HI>Hector Boethius</HI> the <HI>Scot</HI>; whereof the fir&s;t, in his
<HI>Hi&s;tory of Britain,</HI> mainly &s;ought not only to ob&s;cure the Glory
of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Name, but al&s;o to defame the <HI>Britains</HI>
them&s;elves with &s;candalous Lyes; and the other, in attempting to rai&s;e
the <HI>Scots</HI> out of Darkne&s;s, attributes whatever he finds the
<HI>Ro|mans</HI> or <HI>Britains</HI> have done worthy of Commendation in this
I&s;land, all to his Countrymen. Yet does he al&s;o believe that
<HI>Brutus</HI> came into <HI>Britain</HI> with his <HI>Trojans,</HI> and took
upon him the Government thereof; whence they might al&s;o be called
<HI>Britains.</HI> Then he proceeds to the <HI>Divi&s;ion</HI>of
<HI>Britain</HI> into <HI>Lhoegria, Albania,</HI> and <HI>Cambria</HI>; &s;o to
the En|trance of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and by whom the Country was called
<HI>England,</HI> and the People <HI>Sai&s;on.</HI> But now returning to treat
more particularly of <HI>Lhoegr</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> he begins fir&s;t
with <HI>Kent,</HI> and having given an Account of the ancient Names of Places
in this and other Counties, to <HI>fol.</HI> 35, where, having al&s;o reproved
<HI>Sleydan</HI>'s partial Abridgment of <HI>Froi&s;&s;art,</HI> and ended with
the De&s;cent of the <HI>Stuarts,</HI> he begins, as in a <HI>Second Part,</HI>
with the&s;e Words: 
<Q REND="inline">"Now that we have wander'd over all
<HI>England</HI> called <HI>Lhoegr,</HI> let us next in Or|der proceed to the
&s;econd Region of <HI>Britain,</HI> which, of our Countrymen, is called
<HI>Albania,</HI> of the Inhabitants, <HI>Scotland.</HI>"</Q> Here he
ob&s;erves, That there was never any Writer of Name, that made mention either
of <HI>Scots</HI> or <HI>Red&s;hanks</HI> be|fore <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI>'s
Time, about the Year of our Lord's Incar|nation 72, when <HI>Merrigus</HI> or
<HI>Arviragus</HI> reigned in <HI>Britain.</HI> And that they cou'd not be
called by the <HI>Romans, Phichtiani,</HI> for painting their Bodies, &s;ince
they were called by that Name before they were ever known to the
<HI>Latins,</HI> and were the <HI>Britains</HI> whom <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and
others report to have painted them&s;elves <HI>blue</HI> with the Herb
<HI>Woad,</HI> that they might appear more terrible to their Enemies. Then
having given us the Original of the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Red&s;hanks,</HI>
and &s;harply corrected <HI>Boethius</HI> for his many Fal&s;ities, he
proceeds, in the like Manner as he had done of <HI>England,</HI> briefly to
de&s;cribe or explain the Names of &s;everal principal Places in
<HI>Albania</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the circumjacent I&s;lands; &s;o
pa&s;&s;es to the third Part con|cerning <HI>Wales,</HI> upon which our Author
is mo&s;t copious, as well in de&s;cribing the Manners of the People, and the
Cha|racters of &s;ome of their mo&s;t ancient Worthies, as the an|cient Names
of the Places: Inter&s;per&s;ed with many learned Authorities, curious
Ob&s;ervations, and critical Remarks. Of which, we &s;hall mention only his
Reproof of the <HI>Golden</HI> <PB N="201" REF="228"> <HI>Number,</HI> his
De&s;cription of <HI>Wenefride</HI>'s Well; with other Cen&s;ures again of
<HI>P. Virgil</HI> and <HI>William Petit</HI> the Monk, and la&s;tly of
<HI>Gildas,</HI> for his hard Character of the <HI>Britains</HI>; as if he was
to be regarded merely as a Preacher 
<Q REND="inline">"who&s;e Cu&s;|tom is, very &s;harply to inveigh
again&s;t the Faults of their Hearers: Wherefore, if we &s;eek Authorities out
of Sermons as <HI>Polydore</HI> hath done; what Pari&s;h, what Town, what
Nation, or Kingdom may e&s;cape Infamy? What hath <HI>Bernard</HI> written of
the <HI>Romans?</HI> Thus &s;urely, terming them impious, unfaithful,
&s;editious, di&s;hone&s;t, traiterous, great Speakers, but little Doers.
The&s;e Things are by <HI>Divines</HI> &s;poken in the Pulpit, according unto
their Man|ner, that the like Faults may be amended, and the Life reformed; not
that the <HI>Romans</HI> or <HI>Britains</HI> were &s;uch in|deed. Neither is
there any Man, unle&s;s he be a &s;hame|le&s;s Sycophant, that lyeth in wait
for all Occa&s;ions to di&s;|prai&s;e and accu&s;e, which will go about, by
wre&s;ting of Sentences forth of the Sermons of Preachers, &s;landerou&s;|ly to
tax, and infamou&s;ly to note any whole Covent, Shire, City, or People.
Wherefore, let &s;uch idle and ill-di&s;po&s;ed Slanderers leave off, and
&s;uffer the true Re|nown of <HI>Britain</HI> to appear to the World. Neither
judge me good Reader, of too &s;harp a Tongue; &s;eeing (&s;o God help me)
neither Envy of any Foreign Name, neither Thir&s;t of Vain-glory, neither
Hatred of any Nation, but alone the Love of my Country, which is evil &s;poken
of unde&s;ervedly, and de&s;ire to &s;et forth the Truth, have provoked me to
write thus much."</Q> Then follows a &s;hort and mode&s;t Conclu&s;ion, after
which, the whole is ended with certain <HI>Welch,</HI> or rather true
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Words converted into <HI>Latin</HI> by the Author, and now
tran&s;lated into <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>

<P>THE Learned Author of this Work, in his Dedication to <HI>George
Abbot,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> tells him, 
<Q REND="inline">"he has written this Book in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
for the Benefit of his poor &s;educed Countrymen, who are per&s;uaded by the
Prie&s;ts and Je&s;uits that there is no &s;uch Matter, and that their Books
are free&s;t from Corruption, and Minds from Fal&s;hood; that Prote&s;tants are
guilty of this Crime, and &s;undry others. But as St. <HI>Au&s;ten</HI>
ob&s;erved of <HI>Hereticks,</HI> that they were &s;hamele&s;s and impudent,
without Fore|heads, not caring what they &s;aid: So it is with the
<HI>Papi&s;ts</HI>; they do not only impudently deny, but wickedly tran&s;late
the Crime from them&s;elves unto others. For if forging fal&s;e
<HI>Treati&s;es,</HI> or Corruption of the True; changing of
<HI>Scriptures,</HI> or altering of Men's Words, contrary to their Meaning, be
certain Notes of Here&s;y, how heretical then mu&s;t the <HI>Church</HI> of

plainly &s;hewed in this &s;mall Treati&s;e, and what&s;oever el&s;e doth tend

long &s;ince in his Book again&s;t <HI>Hill,</HI> begun to di&s;cover this
devili&s;h Policy of the common Adver&s;ary, and his Grace's Example has

<P><PB N="203" REF="230">After this Addre&s;s, which gives, in this
Part we have here extracted, a Glimp&s;e of the Contents of the Work before us,
we have an ample <HI>Adverti&s;ement to the Chri&s;tian Rea|der,</HI> wherein
he tells him, that 
<Q REND="inline">"having fully travelled this va&s;t Wilderne&s;s
of Sin, I have thought it my Duty to leave certain <HI>Land-Marks</HI> behind
me, for their Direction which &s;hall come hereafter."</Q> The whole Book is
re&s;ol|ved into <HI>five Parts</HI>: The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> &s;hews, <HI>The
Ba&s;tardy of the Fal&s;e Fathers,</HI> and in this Part the&s;e few Things are
to be no|ted, That there are 187 &s;everal Treati&s;es, here di&s;tinctly
produced, which are &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected, if not plainly con|victed of
Forgery by the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> them&s;elves. That our Author follows herein
the Judgment of their mo&s;t e&s;teemed Wri|ters, &s;uch as <HI>Bellarmine</HI>
and <HI>Baronius, Po&s;&s;evin</HI> and <HI>Gret&s;er, Sextus Senen&s;is,
Angelus Roccha, Pamelius,</HI> and &s;undry others; &s;ometimes, tho' &s;eldom,
citing <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> or following his Cen|&s;ure, becau&s;e the
<HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> &s;ay he was an <HI>Apo&s;tate</HI>; tho' he defend|ed the
Religion, then openly maintain'd, again&s;t <HI>Oecolampadi|us, Melancthon,
Martin Luther</HI> and others; was accounted in the bo&s;om of the Church, and
&s;aluted by the Name of Son, by <HI>Adrian</HI> VI. and <HI>Leo</HI> X. And
however he was accu&s;ed for a <HI>Lutheran,</HI> &s;eeing his Apology
&s;atisfied the Pope in his Life|time, why &s;hould the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI>
traduce him being dead? Tho' he were in Heart and Profe&s;&s;ion a
<HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> God made him write again&s;t the Abu&s;es of Popery, rather
than again&s;t the Religion it&s;elf, as him&s;elf &s;ays. But leaving him, let
them con&s;ider the re&s;t who were inflexible <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and &s;ee
here how the be&s;t of them are driven to cen&s;ure the&s;e Treati&s;es, yet
enforced to make u&s;e of them, abu&s;ing the &s;imple Reader, by the frequent
Citation of <HI>Clement, Cyprian, Ambro&s;e, Au|gu&s;tine, Hierome,</HI> and
the re&s;t, when no one Scrip of their Writings is alledg'd; yet
<HI>Cocceius</HI> their Ma&s;ter has been bold to &s;et down the Age when every
one of the&s;e Fathers lived, to tho&s;e ba&s;tard Treati&s;es, which
them&s;elves never &s;aw. Our Author begins his &s;aid <HI>Catalogue,</HI> in
this fir&s;t Part with <HI>Ab|dias,</HI> who lived in the Time of St.
<HI>Paul,</HI> and ends it with <HI>I&s;odore,</HI> who flouri&s;h'd not long
after St. <HI>Gregory</HI>; yet, in this Part, he compri&s;es not all the
Treati&s;es of the Fathers who lived within the Six Hundred Years, condemned by
<HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> nor many more detected by the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> but
only tho&s;e he finds cited by the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> in their Books of
Controver&s;y; e&s;pecially when they are alledg'd to gain Credit with the
&s;imple People; which they well might do, &s;ince &s;ome Learn|ed Men here
named have been deceived, to cite thefe For|geries, <PB N="204" REF="231"> as
the Works of the Fathers, who lived before <HI>Lu|ther</HI>'s Time, &s;o they
cou'd not be forged by <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> who according to the Opinion of
the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> derive their Origin from him. And as to their being
cited &s;ometimes by learn|ed <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> al&s;o, 'tis but
rea&s;onable, as one &s;ide has u&s;ed them for their Convenience, that they
&s;hou'd be as free for the other. After this <HI>Catalogue,</HI> which
comprehends 71 Pages, we have a Li&s;t of the <HI>Names</HI> of the
<HI>Author</HI>'s who&s;e <HI>Books</HI> are cited; and a brief <HI>Table</HI>
wherein is declared, the <HI>U&s;e</HI> that <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> make of the&s;e
<HI>Ba&s;tard Treati&s;es:</HI> With an|other <HI>Table,</HI> &s;hewing who
they were <HI>written by,</HI> or <HI>a&s;cribed to,</HI> and the
<HI>Characters</HI> of them. Thus we come to</P>
<P>Part II. <HI>Of the Corruption of the True Fathers,</HI> wherein
is the greater Danger, becau&s;e it may &s;pread farther before e&s;pied. And
here our Author takes the Word <HI>Fathers</HI> in a large Sen&s;e, extending
it as far as <HI>Gregory de Valentia</HI> does, unto the be&s;t learned of all
Ages. His Ob&s;ervations are ta|ken from the mo&s;t learned
<HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> and particularly his chief Encourager the learned Dr.
<HI>Bil&s;on,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Win|che&s;ter.</HI> Further, this Part
contains, 50 Proofs of corrupted Places in the&s;e Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Writers.
In the 26th Proof, there is a Story rehear&s;ed by our Author of Bi&s;hop
<HI>Jewel,</HI> who citing St. <HI>Gregory</HI>'s <HI>Epi&s;tles</HI> in a
Vi&s;itation Sermon, at <HI>Abingdon</HI> in <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> was defamed
for corrupting his Au|thor's Sen&s;e; which cau&s;ed all the MS. of that Father
to be &s;earch'd, whereby it was found, that the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Editions
on|ly were corrupted, that the Bi&s;hop had quoted the genuine Sen&s;e, and
that tho&s;e who charged &s;uch Corruptions upon him were them&s;elves mo&s;t
guilty of them. Our Author concludes this Part, with his Wi&s;hes for a
<HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Edi|tion of the Councils; and ob&s;erves, that Dr.
<HI>Ward,</HI> Ma&s;ter of <HI>Sidney-Su&s;&s;ex</HI> College, in
<HI>Cambridge,</HI> had be&s;towed many Years Pains in this way, and that his
Endeavours wou'd tend to excellent Purpo&s;es, if he might be prevail'd on to
publi&s;h them; but if any Thing keep him back, it is an humble Conceit he has
ever had, to think him&s;elf &s;o much the le&s;s able, the more &s;ufficient
others e&s;teem him. This Part is compri&s;ed in 103 Pages, and has in another
Page, The <HI>Names</HI> added, of the <HI>Authors</HI> and <HI>Pages</HI>
corrupted.</P>
<P>Part III. <HI>The Variety and Contrariety of the</HI> Popi&s;h
<HI>Bi|bles, commonly called the</HI> Vulgar <HI>Bibles in</HI> Latin. Our
Au|thor's Motives for publi&s;hing this Part were, fir&s;t, becau&s;e it is a
Matter of Faith to appoint what is Scripture, and what not, to &s;hew that the
Pope may err in Matters of Faith. <HI>Se|condly,</HI> <PB N="205" REF="232">
Becau&s;e <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> object to us our different Tran&s;lations of the
Bible, to &s;hew their own gro&s;s Errors and Ab&s;urdities, in &s;etting forth
their two <HI>Hierome</HI> Bibles, authoriz'd by two Popes within two Years.
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> To vindicate his <HI>Bellum Papale,</HI> wrote again&s;t
tho&s;e two di&s;cording Editions, from &s;ome Objections to the &s;ame, lately
publi&s;h'd by <HI>James Gret&s;er.</HI> In this Part it further appears,
The&s;e Bibles were &s;et forth by Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> in 1590, and Pope
<HI>Clement</HI> 1592. And what Sentences or Words were <HI>added</HI> by Pope
<HI>Cle|ment,</HI> which were not in the Edition of <HI>Sixtus:</HI> Al&s;o the
Sentences or Words <HI>left out</HI> by <HI>Clement,</HI> which were in the
Bibles of <HI>Sixtus</HI>; with the <HI>Contradictions</HI> of one again&s;t
the other: Errors in <HI>Numerical</HI> Computations; Tran&s;po&s;ition of
<HI>Names,</HI> and other Alterations of the Sen&s;e: To which follows, An
<HI>Apology</HI> or Defence of the <HI>Bellum Papale,</HI> pub|li&s;h'd by our
Author again&s;t tho&s;e Bibles, 4to, 1600. In which he tells us, how he came
to engage him&s;elf again&s;t tho&s;e Editions; recites the pompous
In&s;cription &s;et up in the <HI>Vatican</HI> in Honour of <HI>Sixtus,</HI>
upon his &s;aid Publication, with the Apologies of &s;ome Je&s;uits for the
Errors therein; as <HI>Baldwin,</HI> Dr. <HI>Norrice,</HI> and Dr.
<HI>Bi&s;hop</HI>; al&s;o &s;ome An&s;wers to <HI>Gret&s;er</HI>'s Allegations
again&s;t our Author: With an Account of <HI>Arias Montanus</HI>'s
<HI>Apology,</HI> for his Integrity in &s;etting forth the King's Bibles,
containing the whole Hi&s;tory of his Trou|bles in the Progre&s;s of that
co&s;tly Work; the Copy of which was found at the Sack of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and
by Dr. <HI>Rives</HI> repo&s;ited in the Library at <HI>Oxford</HI>; this with
a rehear&s;al of &s;ome Sen|tences that are yet found uncorrected, or rather
added un|warrantably to the Vulgar Bible; al&s;o &s;ome further An&s;wers to
his Antagoni&s;t, and a Character of him, concludes this Part in 59 Pages.</P>
<P>Part IV. <HI>Of their condemning the Fathers.</HI> For tho' the
<HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> do much boa&s;t of their Fathers, and vulgarly &s;eem to
value their Writings, yet it is found that none are more injurious to their
Works or their Worth, 
<Q REND="inline">"u&s;ing them as Mer|chants do their ca&s;ting
Counters; &s;ometimes they &s;tand for Pounds, &s;ometimes for Shillings,
&s;ometimes for Pence, &s;ometimes for nothing, according as they be next and
readie&s;t at Hand to make up their Accounts."</Q> In this Part, our Author
acknowledges him&s;elf much indebted to the Second Part of the Dean of
<HI>Winche&s;ter</HI>'s Apology, and to <HI>Sam. Huberus</HI> in his
<HI>Anti-Bellarminus.</HI> And having proved the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions, he
proceeds, to lay open the My&s;tery and Abu&s;es of the <HI>Indices
Expurgatorii;</HI> &s;hews you the Original, <PB N="206" REF="233"> Nature,
U&s;e and Corruption of this <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI>; the Offi|cers,
Inqui&s;itors, Commi&s;&s;aries, and Public Notaries, con|cerned in the&s;e
<HI>Indices of Books to be forbidden, or purged from whatever impugned the
Church of</HI> Rome. And here he com|mends the Treati&s;e, written by
<HI>Gabriel Putherbeus, De tollendis Libris malis,</HI> 1549, as what has
di&s;covered the Wickedne&s;s of their Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Monks, better
than any Work our Author knows. In the latter end of this Part, we have a
<HI>Table of the Divinity</HI> Books, fir&s;t &s;et forth and approved, then
cen&s;ured by <HI>Papi&s;ts.</HI> This Catalogue contains 323 of their &s;aid
<HI>forbidden Books,</HI> which are often noted in what Parts they have been
purged: Among them there are &s;ome of our own Authors; as <HI>Alcuinus,</HI>
who&s;e Book <HI>de Trini|tate, ad Carolum Regem,</HI> printed in <HI>Bibl.
Patrum,</HI> is fal&s;ely by <HI>Sextus Senen&s;is</HI> and others, attributed
to <HI>Calvin</HI>; tho' in|deed their Names are one, by a
<HI>Metathe&s;is</HI> and Change of the Letters. Whereas Copies of it, written
above 500 Years ago, were to be &s;een in the <HI>Prince's Library</HI> at St.
<HI>James's</HI> and el&s;ewhere. St. <HI>Adhelm</HI> Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Sherburne</HI> has al&s;o incurred the <HI>Roman</HI> Cen&s;ure; and the
<HI>Summes</HI> of <HI>Richard Fitz-Rauf,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Armagh,</HI>
again&s;t the <HI>Armenians,</HI> with his other Treati&s;es, are caution'd
again&s;t, as printed Anno 1511, by <HI>Po&s;&s;evine</HI>; and in Bi&s;hop
<HI>Fi&s;her</HI>'s Book <HI>de Fiducia Dei,</HI> the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI>
finding &s;ome Points again&s;t them, have pretended it was printed by &s;ome
<HI>Heretic</HI> in his Name, and even by <HI>Calvin</HI> according to
<HI>Gregory Capuchine.</HI> A &s;illy &s;hift; for the Book was printed at
<HI>Cologn</HI> in 8<HI>vo</HI> 1556, &s;hortly after his Death; and &s;ince
then no &s;uch Matter was ever heard, till of late Years. 
<Q REND="inline">"A very likely Matter (&s;ays our Author) that the

Book in a <HI>Papi&s;t</HI>'s Name? Seeing their <HI>Indices of Books
forbidden, and to be purged,</HI> do furni&s;h us with a &s;ufficient Number in
this kind; without any Labour of ours. So much the more are we kindly beholden

Herein the Author &s;hews how vain it is to find out the Di&s;ea&s;es in Books,
without we endeavour to find out the Remedies al&s;o. This la&s;t Part,
containing 27 Pages, begins with an Account of the &s;undry Ways how Books are
depraved and corrupted, and three Ways propo&s;ed for reforming the &s;ame.
That the Di&s;covery of fal&s;e Treati&s;es, in the Name of the Fathers, has in
part been made by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> Dr. <HI>Reynolds,
Abraham Scultetus,</HI> and e&s;pecially Ma&s;ter <HI>Robert Cooke</HI> of

that tho&s;e Places purged by the Inqui&s;itors are to be re&s;tored as fa&s;t
by the Prote&s;tants. Of a Catechi&s;m to be framed for us out of their
Writings: and how Papi&s;ts are to be an&s;wered by Papi&s;ts. The Collations
of this kind by Mr. <HI>W. Cra&s;haw,</HI> of the <HI>Temple,</HI> commended.
How the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Fal&s;ifica|tions might be &s;hortly di&s;covered, by

Printing; the Ways of correcting them. Our Univer&s;ities and private Libraries
well &s;tor'd with MSS. notwith&s;tanding the great Con&s;umption of them in
<HI>England.</HI> An Exhortation to private Men not to monopolize, but
communicate their MSS. &s;eeing that how commendably &s;oever they pre&s;erve
them, little U&s;e can be made of them, nor their Authorities &s;afely vouch'd,
&s;ince they are not always to be &s;een, while &s;uch Owners are liv|ing; and,
when they die, may ea&s;ily mi&s;carry, by falling into the Hands of &s;uch as
regard them not; by whom, as one merrily &s;aid, <HI>Mony&s;cripts</HI> are
more pored upon than <HI>Manu&s;cripts.</HI> That the Neglect of the Fathers
has pro|ceeded from the fal&s;e Editions of them; and that there would be an

of Copies; with An&s;wers. The Satisfaction of &s;mall Diffe|rences in Copies.
Our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> MSS. highly e&s;teemed be|yond Seas. Our Founders of
Colleges careful to furni&s;h their Libraries with rare MSS. maintaining divers
Scholars abroad, to compare, tran&s;cribe, or procure Originals. That
<HI>Richard Dunelmen&s;is,</HI> Founder of <HI>Dure&s;me</HI> College, now
called <HI>Trinity</HI> College, be&s;towed many thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per
Annum</HI> in Books, and mo&s;t of his Books upon the Li|brary he erected in
that College, who, for his exceeding great Love of Learning, did well de&s;erve
the Name of <HI>Philo-biblos:</HI> See his Book, <HI>De Amore Librorum,</HI>
printed at <HI>Oxford</HI> 1598. <HI>De eo dictumerat, quod haberet plures
Libros quam omnes Pontifices in Anglia.</HI> Which Title and Character, &s;ince
his Time, is mo&s;t ju&s;tly to be given to Sir <HI>T. Bodley,</HI> who&s;e
great Munificence has far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the Bi&s;hop, hav|ing &s;tored his
Magazine, as our Author ob&s;erves, with <HI>eleven</HI> or <HI>twelve
thou&s;and Volumes</HI>; whereof the greate&s;t part are in <HI>Folio,</HI> in
all Sciences and Languages, and fre|quented by Scholars of all Nations. Here
follows the Con|fe&s;&s;ion of his Adver&s;aries, <HI>Po&s;&s;ivine</HI> and
<HI>Co&s;terus,</HI> of the Goodne&s;s and Plenty of our Books; the Way of
di&s;cern|ing corrected Copies, and to know if they be ancient or not. That
tho&s;e which are written in a &s;et Hand, with great Letters, or in the
<HI>Lombard</HI> or <HI>Saxon</HI> Characters, are of great Antiquity; how far
later MSS. to be e&s;teemed of. The Objection, that it is a tedious and
needle&s;s Work to <PB N="209" REF="238"> collate the Fathers Works, with MSS.
an&s;wered. The Benefit likely to ari&s;e of a general Collation.
Commenda|tions of Era&s;mus, and wherein defective, in his Animad|ver&s;ions
upon the Fathers Works. That he gave the fir&s;t Alarm of their barbarous
corrupting the Fathers, for which his very Name is in <HI>Maledictione.</HI>
Exhortation to our wealthy Stationers to print the Fathers Works; &s;uch as Mr.
<HI>Geo. Bi&s;hop,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bonham Norton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>John
Norton,</HI> who have been cho&s;en Aldermen of <HI>London.</HI> That the
Charge of Printers and Stationers ought to be well recom|pen&s;ed. They are
compared to our Merchants-Adventurers. Why, the Hazard being alike in mo&s;t
Books, they &s;hould &s;eek rather to de&s;erve well of the ancient Fathers.
The Bible compared, revi&s;ed, and printed this Year, 1611. St.
<HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI>'s Works, with &s;everal other of the <HI>Greek</HI>
Fathers, likely to be printed at the un&s;peakable Charge of the learned and
judicious Provo&s;t of <HI>Eton</HI> College, and Warden of <HI>Mer|ton</HI>
College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> Sir <HI>Henry Savile,</HI> well &s;een in the
be&s;t Languages, and mo&s;t of the Liberal Arts. The <HI>Latin</HI> Fathers,
more urged in all Controver&s;ies, &s;hould be the &s;ooner correctly printed.
The Collation and Revi&s;ion of the Fathers Works, a good Inducement to the
printing of them. The U&s;e that is made of the MSS. indifferently, both by
Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts; whereof, tho' much re|mains to be &s;poken, our
Author, like a weary Traveller, here takes up his re&s;t; which indeed he might
well need, having gone through &s;uch a Variety of Books, as this Work does
manife&s;t; and really held it, as <HI>Baronius</HI> pretended to do, a
Religion, to &s;ay nothing which he could not prove, and to prove nothing but
out of certain, known, and &s;ufficient Authors. At the End of his
<HI>Adverti&s;ement</HI> mentioned at the beginning, there is an
<HI>Appendix,</HI> &s;hewing fir&s;t, how there are Scribes diligently employ'd
in the <HI>Vatican</HI> Libra|ry, to tran&s;cribe Acts of the Councils, or
Works of the Fathers; that they can imitate their Copies exactly; that it is
feared they alter and change at the Pope's plea&s;ure; and that the&s;e
Tran&s;cripts in time may be vouched for ancient MSS. And this is more to be
feared, if there is an <HI>Index Expurgatorius</HI> for purging of MSS. as well
as printed Books. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the unknown Author of <HI>the Grounds
of the Old Religion, and the New,</HI> &s;o often mention'd in this Work, is
now known to be one <HI>May,</HI> a Prie&s;t, a Man neither immode&s;t nor
unlearned, yet foully mi&s;taken in &s;un|dry Points of his An&s;wer to Mr.

<P>THIS &s;carce Tract is dedicated by the Author to all
<HI>Fathers,</HI> and <HI>Sons</HI> of <HI>worthy Families,</HI> whom Virtue,
Birth, and Learning, have ju&s;tly &s;tiled <HI>Gentlemen.</HI> And in the
&s;aid Addre&s;s has the&s;e A&s;&s;everations; 
<Q REND="inline">"Not upon the lea&s;t Pre&s;umption of a
Self-&s;ufficiency to confront there|by any received Cu&s;tom (if any &s;uch
be) nor to dimi|ni&s;h the natural Reverence due by <HI>younger Brothers</HI>
to their Elder, nor to enkindle Emulation in Families, nor to innovate any
thing to the Prejudice of public or pri|vate Quiet (which none I hope will be
&s;o ill-affected as to &s;uppo&s;e) neither mine inoffen&s;ive Zeal for
younger Brothers, among who I am ranked one; nor the ab&s;o|lute Con&s;ent of
Imperial and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Laws, which I, having a little &s;tudied, not a
little re&s;pect; nor the particular Honour I bear to the U&s;ages in this
Point of our ancient <HI>Britains,</HI> from whom I am de&s;cended; nor
de&s;ire to maintain and ju&s;tify an Act in this kind, done by a Friend, whom
I mu&s;t ever reverence; nor yet the hope of bettering my private Fortunes,
which moves Men much in the&s;e our Times, hath drawn me to this Undertaking:
But principally the &s;ingular Re&s;pect, which, as a Patriot, I bear to the
Glory and Good of <HI>Gentlemens Hou&s;es,</HI> who&s;e be&s;t Original,
&s;ure&s;t Means of Maintainance, and principal Ornament, is Virtue, or Force
of Mind; the want whereof is a common Cau&s;e of Ruin. The <HI>free Power</HI>
therefore of <HI>you,</HI> who are <PB N="211" REF="240"> <HI>Fathers,</HI> is
here in &s;ome &s;pecial Ca&s;es argued and de|fended, to give you occa&s;ion
thereby to con&s;ider, with the clearer Eye-&s;ight, for the E&s;tabli&s;hment
and Con|tinuance of Families. Here al&s;o the natural Rights of <HI>us</HI>
that are <HI>Children,</HI> be &s;o di&s;cour&s;ed and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, as that
we <HI>younger Brothers</HI> may have Cau&s;e and Courage to endeavour, by
virtuous Means, to make our&s;elves, without the lea&s;t wrong to any, capable,
if need &s;hall be, of the chiefe&s;t U&s;es. And both and all, are &s;o
handled, as that no Offence can rea&s;onably ari&s;e in any re&s;pect, much
le&s;s for that the whole is conceived and written in Nature only of an
E&s;&s;ay or Probleme; to which I bind no Man to afford more Belief than
him&s;elf hath liking of, being free to refute the whole, or any part, at his
plea&s;ure, as he feels him&s;elf able or di&s;po&s;ed."</Q> In the
Conclu&s;ion of this <HI>Epi&s;tle,</HI> the Author ob&s;erves, that nothing in
this <HI>Apology</HI> is defended but by Authority, Rea|&s;on, and Example, nor
any Per&s;on taxed, or particular per&s;onal Vices; neverthele&s;s, if he has
not performed as well as he de&s;ires, or the Cau&s;e de&s;erves, he hopes,
that for his good Intention he &s;hall be conceived well of: and
&s;ub|&s;cribes the two Letters of his Name, <HI>J. A.</HI></P>
<P>The Work is divided into <HI>ten Chapters,</HI> whereof the
fir&s;t &s;hews the Occa&s;ion of writing this <HI>Apology,</HI> to prove that
a Father may, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, make any of his Children his Heir, or freely
di&s;po&s;e his worldly E&s;tate to which of his Sons he plea&s;es, leaving to
the re&s;t a Competency; and do an Act which may be ju&s;t, according to the
Law of God, of Nature, and of Nations. The 2d Chapter maintains, That the
Grounds of all good Con&s;titutions being in Nature, yet &s;he neither before
nor after the Law of Propriety e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd, did command that <HI>all</HI>
&s;hould be left to any <HI>one</HI> more than <HI>another:</HI> herein is
al&s;o &s;hewn the happy <HI>Community</HI> of all things in the primitive
Ages; and that <HI>hereditary Succe&s;|&s;ion</HI> or Title to Parents Lands or
Goods, was not in u&s;e till Nature came to be depraved. 3. That the Breach of
&s;ome written Laws of God, upon Warrant of the primary. Law of Nature, is
without Sin; and that therefore there can be no &s;uch Right in
<HI>Primogeniture,</HI> which is not in the Father's Power to avoid, tho' there
were a Precept to the contra|ry, as there is not. 4. That Nations beginning to
devi&s;e &s;undry Forms of &s;ettling <HI>Inheritances,</HI> the
<HI>Romans</HI> e&s;peci|ally therein re&s;pected the free Power of Fathers;
the Right of Children to their Fathers E&s;tates, beginning only at 
<PB N="212" REF="241"> their Father's Death. 5. That the pre&s;ent Cu&s;tom of
our Country, of giving <HI>all,</HI> or <HI>almo&s;t all,</HI> to the
<HI>Elde&s;t,</HI> was never &s;o begun that it meant to exclude just Remedies
for &s;uch Evils, as &s;hould grow out of the Abu&s;e of that Cu&s;tom, when it
may make Fathers guilty of their Sons Faults, and of their Families Ruin. 6.
That it is no Offence before God, for a Father, being Tenant in
<HI>Fee-&s;imple,</HI> to di&s;inherit the Elde&s;t, or to parcel his E&s;tate
upon Cau&s;e; and that extream Vices of <HI>Heirs apparent,</HI> together with
the fewer Means, which younger Brothers have now to live on than heretofore,
crieth out again&s;t the contrary Opinion. 7. That Fathers, being Tenants in
<HI>Fee-tail,</HI> may likewi&s;e with|out Scruple of Con&s;cience,
di&s;continue the <HI>State-tail</HI> upon Cau&s;e, and devi&s;e the &s;ame at
their rea&s;onable Plea&s;ure. 8. That <HI>Unthriftine&s;s</HI> is one known
Name of many hidden Sins, and is alone a &s;ufficient Cau&s;e of
<HI>Di&s;inheri&s;on,</HI> proved by the Law of God and Man, 9. The main Points
of the Premi&s;es exemplified in divers particular Facts, as well of Princes as
of private Per&s;ons. 10. That the Law of na|tural Equity and Rea&s;on, confirm
ju&s;t <HI>Di&s;inheri&s;on</HI>; and that the riotous Lives of elde&s;t
Brothers de&s;erve that vehe|ment Increpation, with <HI>which</HI> the Author
clo&s;es up this Treati&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before we part with this
Subject, we &s;hall here take the Opportunity we have, of referring to a couple

Chapters, The fir&s;t Part is concerning <HI>Fathers;</HI> &s;hewing chiefly
how the Virtues or Vices of their <HI>Children</HI> proceed mo&s;t|ly from
their Examples. And the &s;econd Part, upon <HI>Step-mothers,</HI> ends with
two Chapters under the&s;e Titles, <HI>That di&s;inheriting of the</HI>
elde&s;t Son, <HI>without very great</HI> lawful Cau&s;e, <HI>is an Act very
wrongful and ungodly. That Procurers and Coun&s;ellors of Di&s;inhe|ri&s;on,
and all wrong doing, ought to make or procure Re&s;titution.</HI> But as
&s;trong Arguments as there are herein, again&s;t the di&s;in|heriting of
Heirs, tho' &s;everal Crimes are produced, which they being convicted of, it is

Wor&s;hipful Sir <HI>Nicholas Bacon.</HI> Q^o. 1591. Pages 60. The &s;econd
Chapter of this Tract is upon the Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether the Father may
lawfully di&s;inherit his Fir&s;t-born</HI>; where, tho' there are Arguments
produced on both &s;ides of the Que&s;tion, yet we are induced to di&s;card a
leud lavi&s;h Repro|bate of an <HI>elde&s;t Son,</HI> a riotous Spend-thrift,
which is a Charac|ter le&s;s criminal than tho&s;e produced by the former
Author, for a <HI>younger</HI> that is dutiful, virtuous, and prudent. For that

<Q REND="inline">"a wi&s;e Man will alter Cu&s;tom after
Di&s;cretion, and di&s;po&s;e his Wealth according to Wi&s;dom."</Q> And a
little further, 
<Q REND="inline">"Goods are the Gift of God; and he hath
appointed us not to do as we li&s;t with them, like <HI>Lords,</HI> but to
di&s;po&s;e them well as his <HI>Stewards:</HI> Therefore we ought to be&s;tow
them on &s;uch, where he that gave them may be glorified;"</Q> according to the
A|po&s;tle's Command, which is here cited. Thus much may &s;uf|fice in this

wherefore, the Reader might expect in the Body of his Maje&s;ty's Pamphlet, to
find our Author notably confuted; but in reading that <HI>Dialogue,</HI> he
&s;hall not find one thing or other an&s;wered, but only a bare Affirmation of
&s;uch Tenets, without Ground, or Warrant of Scripture, which were confuted by

<P>As to this Work, now under our In&s;pection, there are Three
ingenious Epi&s;tles, publi&s;h'd by our Author before it. Two of them, to Sir
<HI>Roger Manwood,</HI> Lord Chief Baron of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> and to Sir
<HI>Thomas Scot</HI>; and the third, to Dr. <HI>Coldwell,</HI> Dean of
<HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Readman,</HI> Arch|deacon of
<HI>Canterbury.</HI> Then follows his <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> to the
<HI>Reader</HI>; in which he &s;olemnly profe&s;&s;es, his Drift in this
Undertak|ing was, That the Power and Glory of God &s;hou'd not be abridg'd or
aba&s;ed; that Religion might &s;tand without the Trumpery of &s;uch
Impo&s;tures; and that Compa&s;&s;ion might be u&s;ed towards tho&s;e poor
ignorant Souls, who are com|monly accu&s;ed, and &s;ometimes credulou&s;ly
confe&s;s them|&s;elves guilty of Witchcraft. At the End of this Epi&s;tle,
there is a <HI>Table</HI> of between two and three Hundred Authors u&s;ed in
the en&s;uing Work, which is divided into <HI>Sixteen Books,</HI> and they into
many Chapters; beginning with an Im|peachment of the Power of Witches in
Meteors, and Ele|mentary bodies, tending to the Rebuke of &s;uch as attri|bute
too much unto them. So proceeds in the next Chap|ter, to the Inconvenience
growing by Men's Credulity here|in, and a Reproof of &s;ome Churchmen inclined
to the common Opinion of Witches Omnipotency, with a familiar Example thereof,
in the Story of <HI>Margaret Simons</HI> of <HI>Brenchley</HI> in
<HI>Kent,</HI> who being accu&s;ed of Witchcraft, by <HI>John Ferral</HI> Vicar
of that Pari&s;h, was arraign'd in 1581 at <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>; but one of the
Jury being wi&s;er than the re&s;t, &s;he was acquit|ted. Next we have a
De&s;cription of tho&s;e who are called Witches, the Motives to their being
thought and thinking them&s;elves Witches. What miraculous Acts are imputed to
them, by Witchmongers, Papi&s;ts and Poets. Confutations of the Opinion of
Witchcraft, and the Sin of repairing to <HI>Witches</HI> for help; how their
Name became &s;o famous, and how variou&s;ly People think of them. Cau&s;es why
<HI>Witches</HI> them&s;elves, as well as others, believe they can work
Impo&s;&s;i|bilities, with An&s;wers to certain Objections, where al&s;o their
Puni&s;hment by Law is touch'd, and &s;ome late credulous Pub|lications
reflected on. This Book concludes with an Ar|raignment of the Cruelties
practis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d upon old Women in all 
<PB N="216" REF="245"> Ages, &s;ince the Commencement of Popery, by
Witch|mongers and Inqui&s;itors.</P>
<P>The Second Book &s;hews what infamous Witne&s;&s;es are allowed to
give Evidence again&s;t reputed Witches, and upon what hard Conditions to be
challeng'd; as <HI>James Sprenger,</HI> and <HI>Henry In&s;titor,</HI> from
whom <HI>Bodin,</HI> and other Cham|pions of Witchmongers receive their Light,
allow. Next follows, the Order of their Examination, with an Account of the
<HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Cu&s;toms of accu&s;ing Witches, and King
<HI>Chil|debert</HI>'s cruel Device. Matters of Evidence again&s;t them. Their
Confe&s;&s;ions. Pre&s;umptions whereby they are con|demned. Interrogatories by

<P>The Third Book lays open the Bargains charged upon the&s;e reputed
Witches with the Devil, by &s;everal Popi&s;h Witchmongers here mention'd; with
the Order of their Homage to the Devil: Their Songs, Dances, Excour&s;es,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Their Summons to appear before the Devil; riding in the Air,
Conferences, Supplies, Sacrifices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That there can be no real
League made with the Devil, with the weak Proofs of the Adver&s;aries for the
&s;ame. Of the private League with the Devil. <HI>Bodin</HI>'s fabulous Miracle

their Bargains. A Confutation of the Objection concerning Witches
Con|fe&s;&s;ions. What folly it were for Witches to undergo &s;uch de|&s;perate

they meet with; and how it comes to pa&s;s they are overthrown by their
Confe&s;&s;ions. How Melancholy abu&s;es old Women, and the Effects thereof in
&s;undry Examples. That voluntary Confe&s;&s;ions may be un|truly made, tho' to
the undoing of the Confe&s;&s;ors, and of the &s;trange Operation of
Melancholy, proved by a late In|&s;tance, in the &s;tory, of <HI>Ade Davie</HI>
of <HI>Sellenge</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI> O|ther &s;trange Effects of Melancholy;
that it frequently a|bounds in old Women, and that their Confe&s;&s;ions are
not to be credited. Confutations of their Confe&s;&s;ions, concern|ing their
League, and cau&s;ing of Tempe&s;ts. What wou'd be the Con&s;equence if their

People, who u&s;ed Witches in the Wars. Of the <HI>Eye-biting</HI> Witches in

inchanted Ar|chers, particularly a poor Fellow at <HI>Malling</HI> in
<HI>Kent,</HI> who by one of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Ju&s;tices was puni&s;h'd,
for &s;hooting with Flies, or Familiars, or inchanted Arrows, becau&s;e he

to take away Life, with the Decrees of Divines and Coun|cils in the Ca&s;e.
An&s;wers to the four Capital Crimes ob|jected again&s;t Witches. The Author's
Reque&s;t that his cha&s;te Readers wou'd overlook Eight Chapters in the
fol|lowing Book, reciting &s;ome lewd Feats a&s;cribed to Witches by Doctors of
Popi&s;h Divinity; with his Apology for the &s;ame, as nece&s;&s;ary to be
detected.</P>
<P>The Fourth Book expo&s;es the pre&s;umptuous Opinions of
Witchmongers, in a&s;cribing the &s;uperior Power to evil Spi|rits, of framing
them&s;elves in more excellent &s;ort than God has made us; with their ab&s;urd
A&s;&s;ertions of the incongru|ous Conjunctions of Witches with
<HI>Incubus</HI>; that &s;ince the Year 1400, they have con&s;ented willingly
to the Carnal Embraces of this Diabolical Phantom, and that many Witches burn'd
at <HI>Raven&s;purge,</HI> confe&s;&s;ed &s;uch Carnal Knowledge for many Years
together; with many other Te|nets of the &s;aid unaccountable Intercour&s;e,
mo&s;t gro&s;&s;ly un|philo&s;ophical, and improbable to have met with the
Recep|tion they have done among the mo&s;t Ignorant; &s;uch as the Devil's
vi&s;ible Dealings with Women in this kind, the Pow|er of Witches to ob&s;truct
Generation, and their &s;upernatu|rally depriving Men of the <HI>Paris</HI>
thereof. The Legend of St. <HI>Sylvanus</HI> per&s;onated by <HI>Incubus,</HI>
and of St. <HI>Chri&s;tina,</HI> who charitably &s;upplying the Place of a
Female oppre&s;s'd with one, was &s;hrewdly accloy'd: Al&s;o another ridiculous
Legend of St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> with the Tradition of yellow-hair'd Maids being
mo&s;t encumber'd with <HI>Incubus</HI>; and the be|witchery of married Men, to
u&s;e other Mens Wives in|&s;tead of their own: how to procure the

relation of a lewd Trick of a Prie&s;t in <HI>Gelderland.</HI> In|&s;tances

the wi&s;e di&s;tinction of <HI>Ho&s;tien&s;is,</HI> between Frigidity and
Witchcraft; al&s;o Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI>'s Receipt to procure Generation
mention'd, but not recited even in <HI>Latin,</HI> as the former is; being too
gro&s;s in our Au|thor's mind for Repetition. This Chapter concludes with the
pious Offering made by <HI>Katharine Loe,</HI> of a waxen Re|&s;emblance of the
Parts affected in her impotent Husband, at the Altar of St. <HI>Anthony</HI>
for his Recovery. After the&s;e, and the Narrative of another Cure performed on
a Hag-rid|den Ma&s;s-Prie&s;t, from the Account of <HI>Ja&s;on
Praten&s;is;</HI> This Book concludes with a Confutation of the&s;e Follies
touching <HI>Incubus</HI> and <HI>Succubus,</HI> &s;hewing them to be nothing
but Popi&s;h Impo&s;ture and Knavery, to cover the &s;hameful Debaucheries of
the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks</HI> and their <HI>Concubines:</HI> That <HI>Robin
Goodfellow</HI> was nothing but a lu&s;ty co&s;ening Frier; and that there can
be no Carnal Copulation with Spirits, much le&s;s any Offspring therefrom,
whatever <HI>Hyperius,</HI> and other &s;uch Deceivers write of our
<HI>Merlin:</HI> That <HI>Incu|bus</HI> is a natural Di&s;ea&s;e, and of the
Remedies pre&s;cribed for the &s;ame; with the Deri&s;ion which
<HI>Chaucer,</HI> who had &s;een through the&s;e <HI>Popi&s;h</HI>
Abominations, long &s;ince made of the Prie&s;ts, under that Name, quoted from
his own Ver&s;es in the <HI>Wife of Bath</HI>'s Tale.</P>
<P>The Fifth Book lays open and confutes with many Ar|guments and

Objections concerning <HI>Nebuchad|nezzar,</HI> with their Error relating to

with the &s;everal &s;orts of Witches mention'd in the Scriptures, and how the
word Witch is there apply'd.</P>
<P>The Sixth Book begins with an Expo&s;ition of the <HI>He|brew</HI>
Word <HI>Cha&s;aph,</HI> wherein is an&s;wer'd that Objection in <HI>Exodus,

this Power is impo&s;ed. And this Chapter concludes, with <HI>Bodin</HI>'s
Charge of fal&s;e <HI>Greek,</HI> and fal&s;e Interpretation there|of,
again&s;t <HI>John Wier,</HI> retorted upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Seventh Book begins with explaining the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Word
<HI>Ob</HI> in the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> tran&s;lated <HI>Pytho</HI> or
<HI>Phyoni|cus Spiritus</HI>; which <HI>Hebrew</HI> Word &s;ignifying mo&s;t
properly a Bottle, is there u&s;ed becau&s;e the <HI>Pythoni&s;ts</HI> &s;pake
<HI>hollow,</HI> as in the bottom of their Bellies, whereby they are aptly in
<HI>Latin</HI> call'd <HI>Ventriloqui</HI>; of which &s;ort was <HI>Elizabeth
Barton</HI> the <HI>Holy Maid of Kent,</HI> &amp;c. by which Faculty they many
times overthrow the good Fame of hone&s;t Per|&s;ons. But our Author
pa&s;&s;ing over a hundred Co&s;enages he cou'd recite of this kind; does here
give us a large and true Story of a Wench named <HI>Mildred Norrington,</HI>
practi|&s;ing her diabolical Witchcraft by this <HI>Ventriloquy, Anno</HI>
1574, at <HI>We&s;twell</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> &s;ix Miles from his own
Hou&s;e; with the Account of her detection before two di&s;creet Ju|&s;tices,
named <HI>Thomas Wotton</HI> of <HI>Bocton Malherb,</HI> and <HI>George
Darrel,</HI> E&s;qs; Here, &s;ays our Author, compare this Wench with the Witch

by one Art. The Di&s;covery al&s;o of other &s;uch Deceivers, as <HI>Agnes
Brigs,</HI> and <HI>Rachel Pinder</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> who di&s;gorged

<HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> named <HI>John Stiklebow,</HI> who was
di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of Ten Devils in 1572, according to the Pamphlet then

<PB N="220" REF="249"> in this Ca&s;e. Expo&s;itions of the Places in
Scrip|ture, &s;hewing how <HI>Saul</HI> was abu&s;ed, and how it might all be
wrought by <HI>Ventriloquy.</HI> With other Opinions produced and an&s;wer'd,
tending to prove that our Miracles are com|monly Knaveries, and e&s;pecially of

Fairies, Imps, Incubi, Robin Goodfellows, Men in the Oak, Puckles, Fire-drakes,
Hobgoblins, Tom-thumbs, and all the re&s;t of this Black Brood of Bull-beggars,
have much vani&s;h'd and very little appear'd; and la&s;tly, that tho&s;e who
will credit the Stories of Witches, mu&s;t allow as much to their Power of
working Miracles, as to that of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The Eighth Book &s;hews us how Miracles, the Gift of Prophecy, and

Author applies the manner of Expre&s;&s;ion to that often u&s;ed in Magic,
which &s;ometimes con&s;i&s;ts as well in the deceit of Words as &s;light of
Hand; and this introduces the Illu&s;ions and Confe|deracies here di&s;play'd
in the Art of <HI>Legerdemain.</HI> Here he ob&s;erves the Admiration there was
at <HI>Brandon</HI> the Juggler, who by the Wounds and Words he u&s;ed upon the
Picture of a <HI>Dove</HI> painted on the Wall, promi&s;ed the King before 
<PB N="223" REF="252"> whom he performed, perhaps <HI>Edward</HI> VI. it being
&s;till in remembrance, that a live Dove then on the Hou&s;e-Top &s;hould fall
down dead; which it did accordingly: The Juggler was forbidden the Practice of
this Feat, as if he could murder any body &s;o in Effigie, tho' the My&s;tery
being here revealed, he appeared not to have more dange|rous Power than any
other body. We have here al&s;o many other of the Juggler's Tricks recited and
revealed. Ob&s;er|vations on <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Magicians, a Compari&s;on
between them and our Witches. Many &s;trange Experiments by Gla&s;&s;es, and
the per&s;pective Art. Remarks on the Feats of <HI>Jannes</HI> and
<HI>Jambres</HI>; al&s;o on <HI>Balaam</HI>'s A&s;s. But the Trick which was
called the <HI>Decollation</HI> of <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> perform'd by one
<HI>Kingsfield,</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> in 1582, was long practi&s;ed with
great Surprize to the Spectators; as the League of <HI>Stephen Taylor</HI> and
one <HI>Pope,</HI> the one to &s;teal Hor&s;es, and the other to di&s;cover
them, &s;eems to have been with Pro|fit to the Confederates. But the mo&s;t
dexterous Fellow for <HI>Legerdemain,</HI> in our Author's Time, was <HI>John
Cauta|res</HI> of St. <HI>Martin's</HI>; not that him&s;elf was a mean
Arti&s;t: for &s;ays he, 
<Q REND="inline">"If Time, Place, and Occa&s;ion &s;erve, I can
&s;hew &s;o much herein, that, I am &s;ure, <HI>Bodin, Spinaeus,</HI> and
<HI>Vairus</HI> would &s;wear I were a Witch, and had a fa|miliar Devil at
Commandment: But truly my Study and Travel herein, hath only been employed to
the end I might prove them Fools, and find out the Fraud of them that make them
Fools, as whereby they may become wi&s;er, and God may have that which to him
belongeth."</Q> With this, and the Patters or Prints, of &s;ome juggling
In|&s;truments before-mentioned, our Author ends this Chapter.</P>
<P>The Fourteenth Book treats of the Craft of Alchemy, re|cites
<HI>Chaucer</HI>'s Character and Opinion of Alchemi&s;ts, and their Terms of
Art. Their Preten&s;ions by the Philo&s;o|phers Stone and Waters, with other
Characters, and De|tections of them, by <HI>Chaucer</HI> in his
<HI>Chanon</HI>'s Yeoman's Tale. Several Stories of Per&s;ons cou&s;ened by
Alchemi&s;ts, among the re&s;t, that of <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> in his
<HI>Colloquies.</HI> The Opinion of &s;ome learned Men touching the Folly of
Al|chemy, as <HI>Avicenna, Petrarch, &amp;c.</HI> That vain and de|ceitful Hope
is the Cau&s;e of Delu&s;ion hereby, ending with the Story of the Courtier, who
gave King <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. a fine Hor&s;e, becau&s;e his Maje&s;ty had given
a Pea&s;ant (who had of|ten entertained him in his Hunting Diver&s;ions) a
thou&s;and <PB N="224" REF="253"> Crowns for a Turnip; in hopes of a
proportionable Re|ward, but received the Countryman's Pre&s;ent for his
own.</P>
<P>The fifteenth Book having &s;hewn the Significations of the Word
<HI>Jidoni,</HI> a &s;ort of Conjurers, whom our Author calls No &s;mall Fools,
as not going to work with a Toad or a Cat, as Witches do, but with a kind of
Maje&s;ty call up by Name, and have at Command, no le&s;s than &s;eventy-nine
principal and princely Devils, who have under them, as their Mini&s;ters, many
Legions of petty Devils: and we have here a Li&s;t of all their Names, with an
Account of their Shapes, Powers, Government, their &s;everal Segnio|ries, and
Degrees: The Work of one <HI>T. R.</HI> in 1570. Where|unto is joined, the
Hours wherein it is pretended, that the principal Devils may be bound or
rai&s;ed, and re&s;trained from doing hurt. After which follows a Confutation
of the manifold Vanities in the&s;e Accounts, and of the Pre|dictions derived
from the planetary A&s;pects and Motions; whereof we have here &s;everal
Tables, with their Characters. The Forms used in the pretended Conjurations of
the Spirits of dead Per&s;ons, and for finding hidden Trea&s;ures. The
Con|juration of the three Fairy Si&s;ters for the Ring of Invi&s;ibi|lity, and
for the enclo&s;ing of Spirits in a Cry&s;tal Stone; with Types or Figures
explaining the &s;ame. The Receipt for making of Holy-water; Compacts with
departing Per|&s;ons to appear, and be bound, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then follows a
Con|futation of this kind of Conjuration of rai&s;ing, binding, and
di&s;mi&s;&s;ing of the Devil, going invi&s;ible, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into which
the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ine was deluded, who murdered the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI>
1582. Al&s;o an Ob&s;ervation, that the chief Authors among us of tho&s;e
Conjurations were <HI>T. R.</HI> before-menti|oned, and <HI>John Cokers.</HI> A
Compari&s;on between Popi&s;h Exorci&s;ts and Conjurers. The Detection of a
late cou&s;ening Conjuration practi&s;ed at <HI>Orleans</HI> by the
<HI>Franci&s;cans.</HI> Who may be Conjurers in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church,
be&s;ides Prie&s;ts; a ridiculous Definition of Super&s;tition. Why there were
no Conjurers in the Primitive Church; and that it is more difficult to conjure
the Devil out of one bewitched, than one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; with many other
ab&s;urd Di&s;tinctions. Some Conjurations taken out of the Pontifical and out
of the Mi&s;&s;al. The Rules of Popi&s;h Exorci&s;ts, and other Con|jurers, all
one; and how St. <HI>Martin</HI> conjured the Devil. That it is a &s;hame for
Papi&s;ts to believe other Conjurers Doings, their own being of &s;o little
force; with <HI>Hippocra|tes</HI>'s Opinion of the Art. How Conjurers have
beguiled <PB N="225" REF="254"> Witches. What Books they carry about to procure
Credit-Wicked A&s;&s;ertions by the Ancients again&s;t <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and
<HI>Jo|&s;eph.</HI> All magical Arts confuted, by an Argument con|cerning
<HI>Nero.</HI> What <HI>Cornelius Agrippa</HI> and <HI>Carolus Gallus</HI> have
left written thereof, and proved by Experience. Of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s
Conjurations from <HI>Jo&s;ephus, P. Lombard, Grati|an, Durandus,</HI> and the
Le&s;&s;ons of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church upon St. <HI>Margaret</HI>'s Day.
Tho&s;e Le&s;&s;ons tran&s;lated, and a ridicu|lous Story of that St.
<HI>Margaret</HI> cited. Some other Popi&s;h Mi|racles. Of Vi&s;ions, Noi&s;es,
Apparitions and imagin'd Sounds; wandering Souls, and other Illu&s;ions, with a
Confutation thereof. <HI>Cardan</HI>'s Opinion of &s;trange Noi&s;es; how
coun|terfeit Vi&s;ions grow into Credit. Of <HI>Boniface</HI> his Knavery in
counterfeiting a Voice from Heaven, by which he got the Popedom of his &s;illy
Predece&s;&s;or <HI>Coele&s;tinus.</HI> Of Echos, and <HI>Cardan</HI>'s odd
Story or a Man who was near being drowned by one; and of the &s;trange Noi&s;e
at <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> which was &s;o much wondered at about 1569, tho'
indeed a meer natural Noi&s;e engendered by the Wind and other concurring
Cau&s;es. Of <HI>Theurgy,</HI> or working by good An|gels, with the appendent
Arts, and the Rejection thereof, as altogether papi&s;tical and
&s;uper&s;titious; more particularly expo&s;ed in a Letter here recited, which
was &s;ent to our Author by <HI>T. E.</HI> Ma&s;ter of Arts, Practi&s;er both
of Phy&s;ick, and al&s;o, in times pa&s;t, of certain vain Sciences, for which
he was now, 1582, in Pri&s;on, and condemned to die. In this Letter, it is
confe&s;&s;ed by the Writer of it, that in twenty-&s;ix Years practice of
the&s;e &s;ecret Arts, and conver&s;e with tho&s;e mo&s;t familiar in them, he
could meet with no|thing true as pretended, or &s;upernatural Performance, but
that it was all Impo&s;ture and Delu&s;ion; and recommends a Book written in
the old <HI>Saxon</HI> Tongue, by one Sir <HI>John Malborne,</HI> a Divine of
<HI>Oxenford,</HI> three hundred Years pa&s;t, detecting the Devices of
Conjuration, or opening all the Illu&s;ions and Inventions of the&s;e Arts and
Sciences; which Book this Letter-writer had left with the Par&s;on of
<HI>Slang|ham</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI>; where, he tells our Author, if he
would &s;end for it in his Name, he might have it: But tho' he did &s;end, and
u&s;ed the Intere&s;t of Men of Wor&s;hip and Credit, particularly of the
Knight of the Shire, who would have pa&s;&s;ed his word for the Re&s;titution,
yet &s;uch was the Folly and Super&s;tition of this Par&s;on, that he would not
lend it for our Author's Peru&s;al. But, in truth, he had &s;o
indu&s;|triou&s;ly &s;tored him&s;elf with other <HI>Authorities</HI> and
<HI>Intelli|gences,</HI> <PB N="226" REF="255"> that he appears to have little
needed tho&s;e which this Book might have afforded; in&s;omuch, that whatever
lay clouded or &s;hadowed in the Face of Truth, by this frightful Grey-Beard of
Super&s;tition, &s;eems here di&s;covered by the Light of tho&s;e Authorities,
and that of Rea&s;on, ac|cording to this ryming old Ver&s;e; 
<Q> 
<L>Quicquid Nix celat, Solis calor omne revelat.</L></Q></P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth Book contains a Conclu&s;ion, in manner of an
Epilogue, repeating many of the former Ab&s;urdities of Witchmongers, with
Confutations thereof, and the Au|thorities of <HI>James Sprenger</HI> and
<HI>Henry In&s;titor,</HI> Inqui&s;itors and Compilers of <HI>Malleus
Maleficarum;</HI> more particularly by what means the Vulgar have been brought
to believe in Witches; with a Definition and De&s;cription of Witchcraft.
Rea&s;ons to prove that their Charms, Characters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are all
Fables, and that tho&s;e who u&s;e, them are all Cheats; and from the
Confe&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t notorious among them, more e&s;pecially Mother
<HI>Bungie,</HI> who, in divers Books, &s;et out with Authority, is
regi&s;tered and chronicled, by the Name of the Great Witch of
<HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>; who, on her Death-bed, confe&s;&s;ed, That her Cunning
con&s;i&s;ted only in deluding and deceiving the People with &s;ome little
Skill in Phy&s;ick, and the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Friend, named <HI>Heron,</HI>
which was all the Spirit or Devil &s;he had, whatever the World had been
impo&s;ed on to believe. Further Detec|tions of the&s;e Knaveries in one &s;o
bewitched, that he could read no Scripture but canonical, and a Devil that
could &s;peak no <HI>Latin.</HI> Of the Divination by the Sieve and Sheers, and
by the Book and Key: <HI>Hemingius</HI> his Opinion thereof confuted, and many
other juggling Delu&s;ions. The Con|&s;equences of believing in the Devil's
Transformation, or a&s;|&s;uming of different Shapes, exemplified in the
Instances of Chri&s;t's Argument to <HI>Thomas</HI>; the Inhabitant of
<HI>Tigurie,</HI> ap|pearing to be in wicked Dealings with a Mare, as
<HI>Lavater</HI> records; and the Story of Queen <HI>Cunegunda</HI> from
<HI>Crantzius,</HI> with her Purgation by the Fiery Ordeal, or <HI>Candentis
Ferri.</HI> After another idle Story expos'd, of the Devil preaching holy
Doctrine, in the &s;hape of a Prie&s;t, and Arguments to &s;hew what a &s;hame
it is, after Confutation of the greater Witchcratfs, for any Man to give credit
to the le&s;&s;er Points thereof, we have a general Conclu&s;ion again&s;t
tho&s;e whom this Book concerns; which, with two or three Chapters upon natural
Witchcraft, or Fa&s;cination, bewitching Eyes for Hatred and for Love,
concludes the whole &s;ixteen Book.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="256">Then follows a Di&s;cour&s;e upon Devils or
Spirits; and fir&s;t of Philo&s;ophers Opinions; al&s;o the Manner of their
rea&s;on|ing hereupon, and the &s;ame confuted. Herein the Author proceeds to
&s;hew how un&s;atisfactorily all Authors have writ|ten upon this Subject;
particularly <HI>P&s;ellus,</HI> who&s;e ab&s;urd A&s;&s;ertions are here
expo&s;ed; as al&s;o <HI>Cardan</HI>'s about his Fa|ther's Familiar Devil.
<HI>Plato</HI>'s Opinion of Spirits, and of <HI>So|crates</HI>'s familiar
Devil. The nine Orders of Spirits and An|gels, according to <HI>Plato</HI> and
<HI>Diony&s;ius.</HI> The meaning of Arch|angel, according to Mr.
<HI>Deering,</HI> our Author's Kin&s;man, in his Lecture upon the
<HI>Hebrews.</HI> The Commencement of Devils fondly gathered out of the 14th of
<HI>I&s;aiah.</HI> Of <HI>Lucifer</HI> and his Fall; the Opinion of the
<HI>Cabali&s;ts, Talmu|di&s;ts</HI> and Schoolmen, of the Creation of Angels.
The Con|tention between the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Church about the
Fall; and among the Papi&s;ts. Enquiries where the Battle was fought between
<HI>Michael</HI> and <HI>Lucifer,</HI> how long it continued, and what their
Forces. Other fond Opinions about the fallen Angels, particularly among the
<HI>Rabbins,</HI> Rea&s;ons a|gain&s;t the Devil's Ugline&s;s. That the Devil's
A&s;&s;aults are &s;piritual, and how gro&s;&s;ly &s;ome under&s;tand the
Scriptures herein. The Equivocation of the word Spirit, and how diver&s;ely
taken in the Scriptures. Of Chri&s;t's healing the Blind, and of tho&s;e
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with Devils in the Go&s;pel, or Lunacy, and other
Di&s;ea&s;es. How the word Devil is to be under&s;tood, both in the &s;ingular
and plural Number. The Variation of Authors about Spirits and Souls. Popi&s;h
Opi|nions of Spirits; of Day-devils, and Night-devils. That the Devils
mentioned in Scripture, have their Nature and Qualities in their Names, here
mentioned and interpreted. The Idols or Gods of the Gentiles di&s;tingui&s;hed.
Their <HI>Lares, Larvae, Manes, Daemones,</HI> and <HI>Virunculi Terrei,
&amp;c.</HI> &s;uch as was <HI>Robin Godfellow</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> who
would &s;upply the Office of Servants, &s;pecially of Maids; and
<HI>Hudgin,</HI> a very familiar and &s;ociable Hobgoblin in <HI>Germany,</HI>
&s;o called becau&s;e he always wore a Cap or Hood; therefore our Author thinks
him a kind of <HI>Robin Hood;</HI> and that our Fryar <HI>Ru&s;h</HI> was
altogether &s;uch another Fellow, brought up in the &s;ame School, the Kitchen,
in&s;omuch as the &s;elf-&s;ame Tale is written of one as the other, about the

we are referred to Friar <HI>Ru&s;h</HI>'s Story, or el&s;e to <HI>John Wierus,

called <HI>Dii &s;electi;</HI> the various Gods in other Countries; of 
<PB N="228" REF="257"> Popi&s;h provincial Gods, as St. <HI>George,</HI> St.
<HI>Andrew,</HI> &amp;c. A Compari&s;on between them and Heathen Gods, where it
appears we have had as great Traitors, as great Whores, as great Quacks and
Impo&s;tors, among our &s;anctified and ca|nonized Tribe, as the be&s;t of
them. And whereas our ancient Saints were Patrons only over &s;ome one Province
of Health, or had Power to cure only one Di&s;ea&s;e, nothing comes ami&s;s to
our Moderns thro' the Omnipotency of Witchcraft, yea greater Matters a&s;cribed
to their Powers, than to all other Saints; witne&s;s S. Mother <HI>Bongie,</HI>

divers more, who de&s;erve to be regi&s;tered in the Pope's Kalendar, or the
Devil's Rubric. Then follows a Compari&s;on between the Heathens and the
Papi&s;ts, touching their Excu&s;es for Idolatry. The Idolatry of the Council
of <HI>Trent.</HI> A notable Story of a Hangman arraign'd, after he was dead

Palatine of Che&s;ter, which Mr. <HI>Randolph Crew</HI> had drawn with a Pen.
Then begins the Work under the Title of, <HI>The Vale Royal of England,</HI>
with <HI>a Catalogue of the Kings of Mercia,</HI> or <HI>March</HI>; which
Kingdom in the <HI>Saxon Heptarchy</HI> reached from <HI>London</HI> to the
River of <HI>Mar&s;ey,</HI> which parts <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> from
<HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> containing &s;eventeen Counties, and Part of two more.
This Catalogue contains 22 Kings, beginning <HI>Anno</HI> 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">5 with <HI>Crida,</HI> de&s;cended from
<HI>Woden,</HI> and ending in 886, with Ceolwolph. Next we have an Account,
gather'd, as the former &s;eems to have been, from <HI>Fox, Holin&s;hed,
Llhuyd, Camden,</HI> &amp;c. of <HI>the Dukes and Earls of March,</HI> before
the Conque&s;t, who were al&s;o Palatines of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI>; for that it
was a County Palatine before the Conque&s;t, appears in the
<HI>Supplication</HI> here exhibited to King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. by the
Inhabitants there|of; and al&s;o that they were, among other Privileges,
ex|empted from the granting of Sub&s;idies, appears by that King's
<HI>An&s;wer</HI> thereunto. Then we have a Confirma|tion of the
<HI>Liberties</HI> of the County Palatine by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> 1568,
with the Opinions of the Judges, <HI>Dier, We&s;ton, Harper,</HI> and
<HI>Carns,</HI> concerning the Juri&s;diction and Liberties of the &s;aid
County. Here we enter upon a par|ticular <HI>De&s;cription</HI> of the County;
its Length about 44 Miles; Breadth about 25, and Compa&s;s 112 Miles; Num|ber
of Market-Towns 11; Pari&s;h Churches 87; Longi|tude 17 Deg. 30 Min. and
Latitude 53 Deg. 30 Min. with the rea&s;on, from its low Situation, of its
being named the Vale-Royal, by King <HI>Edward</HI> I. when he founded an Abbey
in the mid&s;t of the Shire. So we proceed to the Tempera|ment of the Air, the
Fertility and Products of the Soil, a|mong which the <HI>Salt-Wells</HI> are
not forgot; la&s;tly of their Buildings, the Di&s;po&s;ition of their People,
and their Man|ner of Hou&s;e-keeping. Hence we pa&s;s to the Waters and their
Cour&s;es, beginning with the River <HI>Dee</HI>; &s;o of the
<HI>Mar&s;ey,</HI> the <HI>Weaver,</HI> the <HI>Dane, Bollin, Peever,
Wheelock,</HI> <PB N="232" REF="261"> <HI>Taume,</HI> and the <HI>Goit</HI>;
with others mentioned by <HI>John Le|land,</HI> and <HI>W. Harri&s;on.</HI>
Thus we come to the Particulari|ties of <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> that is, the
Divi&s;ions or <HI>Hundreds,</HI> into which the County is di&s;tingui&s;hed,
and they are &s;even. Of <HI>Weral,</HI> the fir&s;t here mentioned, we have a
De&s;cription from <HI>Leland,</HI> and of <HI>Helbrie</HI> I&s;land: Then
follow the Names of all the <HI>Villages</HI> and <HI>Town&s;hips</HI> in this
Hundred. So we go on to <HI>Broxton,</HI> with a Li&s;t of all the Town&s;hips
therein; the like of <HI>Nantwich, Edsbury, Northwich, Bulk|ley,</HI> and
<HI>Maxfield.</HI> Here we have a brief Account of the Antiquity of the City of
<HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> from <HI>Henry Brad&s;haw</HI> and <HI>Ranulph Higden,</HI>
two Monks of that City, and from <HI>Holin&s;hed</HI> and <HI>Harri&s;on</HI>;
and then a Map giving a Pro&s;pect of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> the Ground Plot, and
Arms of the Earls &s;ince the Conque&s;t. Then we advance more particularly to
the Longitude and Latitude of the City, De&s;criptions of the Walls, the Gates,
the Bridge, the Ca&s;tle, Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, Shire-Hall, Exchequer, and the
Pari&s;h Churches in <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> Next of the Mayor, Aldermen, Sheriffs,
Common-Hall, the <HI>Pendice,</HI> the <HI>Rows,</HI> the Mercer's <HI>Row</HI>
and Conduits. Then of the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> The Divi&s;ion of
<HI>Mer|cia</HI> into five Bi&s;hopricks. The Names of the Bi&s;hops of
<HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> &s;ince the Beginning of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.
Market-Towns in <HI>Che&s;hire.</HI> The Manner of making Salt at
<HI>Nant|wich,</HI> and at <HI>Northwich.</HI> After that &s;hort Account of
the Market-Towns, and &s;ome others of principal Note, and a Reference to the
Map for the re&s;t, not named here, we have the Genealogy of the Earls of
<HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> &s;ince the Con|que&s;t; wherein is briefly &s;hewed &s;ome
Part of their Deeds, beginning with <HI>Hugh Lupu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and ending with <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Black
Prince,</HI> who was the eleventh Earl. After the&s;e fol|lows a Note of the
chief Places of Gentlemen in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> from <HI>John Leland</HI>;
and next, the Names of all the <HI>Knights, E&s;quires, Gentlemen,</HI> and
<HI>Freeholders</HI> in the County <HI>Pala|tine</HI> of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI>
and in what Hundred they dwell, taking up about three Leaves and a half. Then
comes a Li&s;t of all the <HI>Mayors</HI> and <HI>Sheriffs</HI> of
<HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> beginning 1320, ending 1586, about fourteen Leaves. After
this, we have another Li&s;t of the <HI>Benefices,</HI> or Rectories, and
Vicaridges in the County, with their <HI>Valuations,</HI> from a MS. in the
Library of St. <HI>John</HI>'s College, <HI>Cambridge.</HI> Then comes the
De|&s;cent of the Barons of <HI>Haulton,</HI> Con&s;tables of
<HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and a Sculpture repre&s;enting <HI>Bee&s;ton</HI> Ca&s;tle,
with the Ca&s;tle and Town of <HI>Haulton</HI>; al&s;o &s;ome <HI>Latin</HI>
Ver&s;es upon <HI>Bee&s;ton</HI> <PB N="233" REF="262"> Ca&s;tle, built by
<HI>Ranulph,</HI> third Earl of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> from <HI>Le|land,</HI> with
Tran&s;lations of the la&s;t <HI>Di&s;tich,</HI> from <HI>Speed</HI> and
<HI>Camden</HI>; and a Note of the Battle on <HI>Blore</HI> Heath,
<HI>Anno</HI> 1459; which, with another Note touching the <HI>Arms</HI> of the
Gentry in this County, introducing eleven Pages of them, repre&s;ented in
<HI>Sculpture, alphabetically,</HI> and a <HI>Table</HI> of the remarkable
Pa&s;&s;ages, in the foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e, fini&s;hes this Part of the
<HI>Vale-Royal,</HI> a&s;cribed to <HI>William Smith,</HI> by our Editor as
afore&s;aid; which, be&s;ides the Sculptures, takes up 99 Pages.</P>
<P>The other Part, or De&s;cription of this <HI>Vale-Royal,</HI> by
<HI>William Webb,</HI> M. A. and &s;ometimes Under-Sheriff to Sir <HI>Richard
Lee,</HI> begins with his Wi&s;hes, that the Labours of Mr. <HI>John
Norden</HI> had been continued to the fini&s;hing of that Hi&s;torical and
Chronographical De&s;cription of the re&s;t of the Shires of this famous
I&s;le, which he had begun in that of <HI>Middle&s;ex:</HI> al&s;o his
Commendations of our Worthy Coun|tryman, Mr. <HI>John Speed</HI>'s Labours of
the &s;ame nature. At the End of this Introduction, he gives us a &s;ummary
Ac|count, for his more methodical Proceeding, of what Mat|ter he has cho&s;en
to treat, and in what manner; &s;o enters upon a De&s;cription of the City and
County Palatine of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI>; and becau&s;e <HI>Broxton,</HI> in
&s;ome &s;ort, contains or borders upon, and almo&s;t encompa&s;&s;es the
&s;aid City, he fir&s;t makes a &s;hort Survey of that <HI>Hundred,</HI> then
more par|ticularly de&s;cribes the City it&s;elf, recites its Names, re|marks
upon the ancient Foundations and Buildings thereof, more as a Topographer than
Antiquary, tho' not wholly a|voiding hi&s;torical Ob&s;ervation, where it will
illu&s;trate his Account, as him&s;elf profe&s;&s;es. The Authors u&s;ed in
this De&s;cription, are <HI>Giraldus Cambren&s;is, Peter Langtoft, Ranulph
Higden, Harding, Caxton, Fabian, Holin&s;hed, Stow, Camden,</HI> and a
manu&s;cript Life of St. <HI>Werburg,</HI> in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;e, by
<HI>Henry Brad&s;haw,</HI> Monk of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI>; out of whom he makes
&s;everal Quotations, and calls him their be&s;t Anti|quary. Then follows a
Di&s;cour&s;e of the Foundation and Endowment of the Abbey of St.
<HI>Werburg</HI> in <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> writ|ten by <HI>N. N.</HI> with two
Sculptures repre&s;enting the Ground-Plot of her Church, and the Southern
Pro&s;pect of it. This holy Virgin appears to have been the Daughter of
<HI>Wulpher,</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> who died <HI>A. Dom.</HI> 675. She
had the Com|mand over the Mona&s;teries of <HI>Weedon, Trentham, Repton,</HI>
and <HI>Hambury.</HI> In her tender Years was profe&s;&s;ed under her Aunt
<HI>Andry</HI> at <HI>Ely,</HI> lived much at <HI>Weedon,</HI> deceas'd at 
<PB N="234" REF="263"> <HI>Trentham,</HI> and was buried at <HI>Hambury,</HI>
but twice tran&s;la|ted, fir&s;t from <HI>Trentham</HI> to <HI>Hambury</HI>
about the Year 708, af|terwards to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> about 875, as the 2 B.
and 2 Chap. of her <HI>Life</HI> afore&s;aid te&s;tify. After which follow
&s;everal mo|numental In&s;criptions in the Quire of the &s;aid Abbey, and in
St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Chapel, for <HI>William Downham,</HI> Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> who died 1577; Dr. <HI>Geo. Lloyd,</HI> Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Sodor,</HI> 1615; Dr. <HI>John Lloyd,</HI> a famous Civilian, 1607; Sir
<HI>Geo. Beverley</HI>; the famous Abbot <HI>Simon Ripley,</HI> who died about
1492; Sir <HI>W. Gerrard,</HI> 1581; and in St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Chapel, Sir
<HI>Henry Troutbeck,</HI> round the Effigies of who&s;e Body, in compleat
Armour, is neatly wrought a Wreath of Trouts. Here al&s;o was buried the late
famous Citizen <HI>Robert Brere|wood,</HI> Alderman, and thrice Mayor of
<HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> who was, &s;ays our Author, 
<Q REND="inline">"The happy Father of the learned <HI>Edw.
Brerewood,</HI> of <HI>Oxford</HI>; who&s;e &s;urpa&s;&s;ing Progre&s;s in the
Stu|dies of all manner of Learning, the Univer&s;ity does yet, and for ever
will ring loud of; and <HI>Gre&s;ham</HI> College in <HI>London,</HI> where he
was <HI>Mathematical</HI> Reader, will, to the World's end, bewail the want of;
being deprived of him by an untimely Death, before he had fini&s;hed, or taken
Order for Pre&s;ervation of &s;uch learned Labours, as, if they were
publi&s;hed, wou'd make the World be|holden to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> the Nur&s;e
of &s;uch a Father, which begat &s;uch a Son."</Q> Here are al&s;o recited
&s;everal In|&s;criptions of &s;everal other Mayors, Aldermen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
of the &s;aid City. Then, after &s;ome Ob&s;ervations upon the River
<HI>Dee,</HI> and the renewing of the Haven, our Author gives us the Remainder
of his Remarks upon <HI>Broxton</HI> Hundred, taking notice all the way he
travels along, by the Towns and Lord&s;hips, of the principal Seats, or
Mannor-Hou&s;es, and by whom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or inhabited. This is al&s;o his
Cour&s;e thro' the Hundred of <HI>Nantwich,</HI> where we have a Recital of the
Foundation-Charter of <HI>Cumbermere</HI> Abbey in <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> founded
<HI>Anno</HI> 1133, by <HI>Hugh Malbanc,</HI> from the Annals of
<HI>Crock&s;don,</HI> in the <HI>Cotton</HI> Library. In this Hundred, we have
&s;ome Remarks upon the Excellency of their Chee&s;e, on their Salt-Pits or
<HI>Wiches,</HI> and a Sculpture of <HI>Crew</HI>-Hall. In the Hundred of
<HI>Northwich,</HI> our Author thinks the Ale of <HI>Sandach</HI> as worthy of
Prai&s;e, as Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> does that of <HI>Derby</HI>; and if that Ale
got its Name from the old <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> word <HI>Oel,</HI> as he &s;ays,
our Author knows not why this may not, almo&s;t with as little Variation, come
from <HI>Oil,</HI> being almo&s;t as &s;ub&s;tantial in handling. He al&s;o
remarks upon <PB N="235" REF="264"> the common Report of the Trees, which are
&s;een floating in <HI>Bagmere</HI> Pool above Water, ju&s;t before any Heir of
the Hou&s;e of <HI>Brereton</HI> the Owner thereof dies; but looks upon it as
meerly accidental. In <HI>Eadsbury</HI> Hundred, we have the Foundation-Charter
of the Abbey of <HI>Dernhall,</HI> in the County of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI>
tran&s;lated afterwards to the <HI>Vale-Royal,</HI> given by <HI>Edward,</HI>
elde&s;t Son of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. in the 54th Year of his Reign; al&s;o
the &s;aid King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Letters of Recommendation to all Abbots,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> for Books to be be&s;towed on the &s;aid
Abbey; al&s;o the Charter for Tran&s;lation of the &s;aid Abbey to the
<HI>Vale-Royal.</HI> This Hundred he concludes with an Apology for pa&s;&s;ing
over &s;ome old Prophecies, &s;ome conceited Names of Trees, Mo&s;s-Pits,
Pools, long Shoots of old Archers, a Hor&s;e Race or two, and the latter
Newfound-Well, becau&s;e he &s;up|po&s;es his long Journey in this little
Hundred, has well nigh tired his Reader already. In <HI>Werall</HI> Hundred,
when he comes to <HI>Birket</HI> Wood, we have a Pro&s;pect, in Sculpture, of
the Ruins of <HI>Berkenhead</HI> Abbey. A Reference to the
<HI>Mona&s;ticon,</HI> fol. 404; with the Charter of <HI>Hamon
Ma&s;&s;ie</HI>'s Donation of the Church of <HI>Bowdon,</HI> and another
Charter of Power to the Monks of <HI>Berkenhead.</HI> Thus he pa&s;&s;es on, as
through the re&s;t of the <HI>Hundreds,</HI> giving De&s;criptions of the chief
<HI>Seats</HI> all the way, and Characters of the <HI>Gentry</HI> who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, till he arrives again at the famous City of
<HI>Che&s;ter</HI>; and here takes the Government with its Go|vernours under
Con&s;ideration, &s;o begins with a Narrative of the <HI>Earls</HI> of
<HI>Che&s;ter</HI>; and fir&s;t of tho&s;e four or five be|fore the Conque&s;t,
who were named <HI>Edolf,</HI> from the Te&s;|timony of <HI>Ranulph
Ce&s;tren&s;is</HI> and <HI>Fabian.</HI> 2. <HI>Cur&s;on,</HI> accor|ding to
<HI>John Harding.</HI> 3. The famous <HI>Leofric,</HI> who&s;e Power, Grandeur,
and charitable Works are celebrated by many Hi&s;torians; but the Story of his
Wife <HI>Godwina,</HI> or <HI>Godiva,</HI> riding through the City of
<HI>Coventry</HI> naked, to ob|tain the Franchi&s;ement of the City, is
&s;u&s;pected by our Au|thor. 4. His Son <HI>Algarus.</HI> But the&s;e two (and
much le&s;s <HI>Jonas,</HI> mentioned in the Chronicle of <HI>St. Albans,</HI>
or <HI>Otho|nel</HI>) are, tho' allowed to have been Earls of <HI>March,</HI>
by Sir <HI>John Fern,</HI> in his <HI>Second Part of Lacie's Nobility,</HI> not
rec|koned to have been Earls of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> but he thinks they are &s;o
mi&s;taken to have been, by their Re&s;idence or Abode in that City, or
thereabouts. Here we enter upon the Hi&s;tory of the Earls of
<HI>Che&s;ter</HI> from the Conque&s;t, of whom there is more certain Record;
beginning with <HI>Hugh Lupus,</HI> who was <PB N="236" REF="265"> the Son of
<HI>William</HI> the Conqueror's Si&s;ter, and we have a Sculpture
repre&s;enting the &s;aid Earl in Parliament with the Barons and Abbots of the
County Palatine; which <HI>Hugh</HI> having governed the Earldom 40 Years, died
about 1107. In the like manner, we have a Chapter a-piece upon the &s;ix
en&s;uing Earls, ending with <HI>John Scot,</HI> who died in 1237, without
I&s;&s;ue. King <HI>Henry</HI> III. took the Earldom of Che&s;|ter into his
hands, and it was thenceforward held by Princes of the Blood Royal; of whom,
after a little Account of the Barons under the ancient Earls, we have al&s;o a
Cata|logue down to Prince <HI>Charles.</HI> This is followed with a
Di&s;|cour&s;e of the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> State and Government in this
County; the Succe&s;&s;ions of the <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and, with more
certainty, from the 33d of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. ending with Dr. <HI>John
Bridgman.</HI> The next Chapter treats of the Govern|ment of the County and
City, by the Officers, or Princes, who ruled here after the Earls, down to King
<HI>James</HI> I. Then we have a Table of the Mayors and Sheriffs of
<HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> from 1242 to 1655, inter&s;per&s;ed with little
hi&s;torical Me|moirs of &s;ome noted Occurrences, happening under &s;everal
Years within that Time and Place. After this, we have the Names of the
Ju&s;tices of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> with another Li&s;t of the Sheriffs of the
County: and the whole clo&s;es with a Copy from <HI>Dome&s;day</HI> Book,
<HI>&s;ub Titulo, Ce&s;ter&s;heire</HI>; &s;hew|ing in who&s;e
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the Lands of this County were at the Conque&s;t. So ends
this &s;econd and more copious Nar|rative of the &s;aid County Palatine,
containing 239 Pages; and has an <HI>Index,</HI> like the former, at the End of
it.</P>
<P>But here follows another Tract, not before &s;poken of in either
of the Title-Pages before the Book, or in the Editor's Preface, not being
communicated perhaps till they were printed; and it is called <HI>Chronicon
Ce&s;tren&s;e,</HI> written by <HI>Samuel Lee,</HI> as appears at the End of
his Epi&s;tle to the &s;aid Editor his ingenious Friend Mr. <HI>D. King,</HI>
dated <HI>May</HI> 8, 1656. In this Epi&s;tle, perceiving the exact Times of
the former Rulers of that Province, not &s;o much attended as might
illu&s;trate that <HI>Vale-Royal,</HI> he de&s;ired to communicate to Pa|per,
what he has ob&s;erved in his Reading, which might conduce to the fixing of the
Times and Sea&s;ons, wherein the noble Atchivements of its Rulers and
Inhabitants have been performed. And indeed he has &s;hew'd him&s;elf more
critically acquainted with all our ancient Hi&s;torians, as to Time and Place,
the two Eyes of Hi&s;tory, than both the foregoing Authors put together. His
Work begins with a <PB N="237" REF="266"> Chapter upon the Romans in
<HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> in which we have the various Opinions of &s;everal Authors
concerning its Longitude and Latitude; but he prefers <HI>Shakerley</HI> in his
<HI>Briti&s;h Tables,</HI> before all the re&s;t. Then we have, in Chap|ter 2,
the Kings, Dukes, and Earls of <HI>Mercia,</HI> with the particular Earls of
<HI>Che&s;ter</HI> from the Conque&s;t, and tho&s;e of the Royal Blood,
di&s;po&s;ed in their exact Times, in five &s;e|veral Sections. The third
Chapter treats of the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Mercia,</HI> who had their Seats
&s;ometimes at <HI>Coventry,</HI> &s;ome|times at <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> mo&s;t
commonly at <HI>Litchfield,</HI> and there|fore are u&s;ually &s;o &s;tiled;
but had <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> under their Epi&s;|copal Government. Al&s;o of the
Bi&s;hops of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> &s;ince the Conque&s;t; and of the peculiar
Bi&s;hops of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> from the Time of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in
four Sections. The fourth and la&s;t Chapter di&s;cour&s;es of the
Parliamentary Barons of the Earls of <HI>Che&s;ter:</HI> And fir&s;t of the
Barons Temporal, in which we have the Stem of the Barons of <HI>Haulton</HI>;
la&s;tly, of the Barons Spiritual, being an Account of the Earls, Bi|&s;hops,
and Abbots. But before we leave this Work where|in the Author has proved
him&s;elf &s;o expert in calculating and fixing of ancient Times, as to make us
wi&s;h that <HI>Saxon</HI> Hi&s;tory he promi&s;es in two or three Places, had
&s;een the light; we &s;hall only remark out of his &s;econd Chapter, upon the
<HI>Mercian</HI> Monarchy, how he accounts for many Defects in our old
hi&s;torical Computations; where he &s;ays, 
<Q REND="inline">"Con&s;i|dering that all our Monki&s;h Writers
more skillful in num|bering of Beads than Years, did <HI>uno tramite</HI>
follow the <HI>Diony&s;ian</HI> Account, a thing diligently to be attended in
the reading of our <HI>mona&s;tical</HI> Writers, I hope to extricate my&s;elf
out of the&s;e Difficulties, by treating a little of it be|fore I begin with
the Reigns of the Kings of <HI>Mercia.</HI>"</Q> Then having given an Example
to &s;hew wherein that Ac|count is deficient, and Direction to &s;everal
Authorities for Confirmation thereof, he further 
<Q REND="inline">"refers this to be proved more at large in its
proper Place, when he treats about the <HI>Saxons</HI> Arrival into our Land,
demon&s;trating their Entrance to have been in the Vulgar Year of Chri&s;t 428,
and not in 449 or 450, as our old Authors u&s;ually fix'd it; whereby great and
knotty Difficulties have tied up the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Dominion
in this I&s;land."</Q> Thus much of this Chronological Treati&s;e, containing
55 Pages. We come now, la&s;tly, to</P>
<P><HI>A &s;hort Treati&s;e of the I&s;le of Man,</HI> &amp;c.
illu&s;trated with &s;everal Pro&s;pects of the I&s;land by <HI>D. King,</HI>
1556. 'Tis <PB N="238" REF="267"> dedicated to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord
<HI>Fairfax,</HI> Lord of <HI>Man,</HI> and of the I&s;les, by the Author
<HI>James Chaloner,</HI> one of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners for &s;ettling Affairs
in that I&s;land, who dates his &s;aid Epi&s;tle from <HI>Middle-Park,
Dec.</HI> 1, 1653; wherein it ap|pears, he was the rather induced to pre&s;ent
the &s;ame to his Lord&s;hip, becau&s;e of his Re&s;pect to Antiquities, &s;o
&s;ignally manife&s;ted in patronizing our notable <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Antiquary
Mr. <HI>Roger Dod&s;worth,</HI> in his Collections, compo&s;ing and
pub|li&s;hing of that &s;ingular Piece his <HI>Mona&s;ticon,</HI> &amp;c. The
Work is divided into &s;ix Chapters, which, after a Map of the I&s;land
environ'd with little Pro&s;pects of &s;ome notable Parts or Places in it,
begins, 1. with the Situation of the <HI>I&s;le of Man.</HI> 2. Concerning the
Inhabitants, whence derived, their Lan|guage the <HI>Manks</HI> Tongue, and of
the Tran&s;lation of the Bible therein, and of the Conditions of the People. 3.
Of the State Eccle&s;ia&s;tical; of the Bi&s;hops, Mona&s;teries, and
Free-Schools, with three Pro&s;pects in Sculpture, of <HI>Bali&s;aly</HI>
Abbey, the Nunnery; and the Bi&s;hop's Court. 4. Of the Civil Government, and

Sir</HI> THOMAS BODLEY; <HI>containing his</HI> LIFE, the fir&s;t

<HI>Engli&s;h</HI>) and a <HI>Collection</HI> of LETTERS to Dr. JAMES, &amp;c.

<P>THESE <HI>Remains</HI> of that famous <HI>Founder</HI> of the
<HI>Public Library</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> are pretty well known to have been
publi&s;hed, tho' their Editors Name appears not to them, by the late Mr.
<HI>Hearne.</HI> In his <HI>Preface,</HI> after having touch'd up|on the
Antiquity of <HI>Letters</HI> and <HI>Libraries,</HI> and &s;hewn how ancient
they were in <HI>Egypt</HI>; what a magnificent Collection was made there by
<HI>Ptolemy,</HI> and what Ambition the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> had
of this kind; he de&s;cends to ob&s;erve how early Learning flouri&s;h'd in
<HI>Britain</HI>; and that in King <HI>Al|fred</HI>'s Time, there were divers
Libraries for the Pre&s;erva|tion of Learning; but is more particular of
<HI>Richard de Bury,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham,</HI> his noble Gift of Books
to this Univer|&s;ity in 1295, as may be further gather'd from his own Ac|count
in his <HI>Philobiblos, &s;ive de Amore Librorum,</HI> fir&s;t prin|ted at
<HI>Paris,</HI> afterwards at <HI>Oxford,</HI> 4to, 1599, and &s;ince in 8vo.
Al&s;o of <HI>Thomas Cobham,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI>'s Build|ing
for a Library in the &s;aid Univer&s;ity in 1320. That after this, another
Library was built there by Duke <HI>Humphrey,</HI> and famous in 1439, which
falling to Ruin towards the end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, Sir
<HI>Thomas Bodley,</HI> a &s;econd <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> began to re&s;tore it in
1597, fini&s;h'd it in two Years, and in a few more &s;o nobly endow'd it with
Books, Re|venues, and other Buildings, that it is accounted one of the
<HI>mo&s;t famous Libraries in the World</HI>; excelling, according to the
Accounts of Travellers, the <HI>Vatican</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI>; that being &s;o
full of Corruptions and Forgeries. The <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of the <HI>Bodleian
Library</HI> is given us by the <HI>Oxford</HI> Antiquary (<HI>An|thony
Wood</HI>) at large: But the <HI>Catalogue</HI> of the Printed Books, by Dr.
<HI>Hyde</HI>: We have had one &s;ince al&s;o of the MSS; but both being
imperfect, we are here told, an <HI>Appendix</HI> <PB N="240" REF="269"> to the
former, as big as the Doctors Catalogue, was now ready for the Pre&s;s; and
that an <HI>Appendix</HI> al&s;o to the latter, was in &s;ome time to be
publi&s;h'd; yet are we &s;till in expec|tation of them. The Editor likewi&s;e
&s;ays, 'Twas for the &s;ake of this noble Library, that lately, in his
&s;earches there|in, finding the <HI>Life</HI> of Sir <HI>Thomas Bodley</HI>;
the fir&s;t Draught of its <HI>Statutes,</HI> and a Collection of his Letters
to Dr. <HI>James,</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>Keeper</HI> of it, all written by Sir
<HI>Thomas</HI> his own Hand, he took a Tran&s;cript of them, and &s;ent them
to the Pre&s;s; that others, imitating Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> his Zeal and
In|du&s;try for the good of Learning, might become Benefactors them&s;elves to
&s;uch a noble Repo&s;itory; which they cou'd not do at a better time, &s;ince
the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> for &s;ending certain Copies thither,
of Books printed at <HI>London,</HI> was expired. The <HI>Life,</HI> he &s;ays,
has been printed &s;ome Years before, and two Letters to Sir <HI>Francis
Bacon,</HI> lately, at the end of Archbi&s;hop <HI>U&s;her</HI>'s Letters; but
the Copies of the former, being di&s;per&s;ed, and the latter, containing
Mat|ter of Moment, it was thought fit to reprint them.</P>
<P>In the LIFE <HI>of Sir</HI> THO. BODLEY <HI>written by
him&s;elf,</HI> con|&s;i&s;ting of 15 Pages, he tells us he was born at
<HI>Exeter</HI> in <HI>De|von&s;hire,</HI> the 2d of March 1544, of
Wor&s;hipful Parents. That his Father, a known Enemy to Popery, fled in Queen
<HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign into <HI>Germany,</HI> &s;ent for his Family and
&s;ettling at <HI>Geneva,</HI> when our Author was twelve Years of Age, had him
in&s;tructed in <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> by <HI>Chevalerius</HI> and
<HI>Beroaldus</HI>; and in Divinity by <HI>Calvin</HI> and <HI>Beza,</HI>
be&s;ides Do|me&s;tic Teachers. In the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s
Reign, they return'd to <HI>London,</HI> and he was &s;ent to com|plete his
Studies at <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he took his Batchelor of Arts Degree, and was
cho&s;e Probationer of <HI>Merton</HI> College in 1563, and the Year after
admitted Fellow. In 1565 read the <HI>Greek Lecture.</HI> Proceeded Ma&s;ter of
Arts 1566, and read for that Year, <HI>Natural Philo&s;ophy</HI>; was elected
one of the Proctors in 1569. Supply'd for a long time, the Place of
<HI>Univer&s;ity Orator.</HI> Travell'd into <HI>Italy, France,</HI> and
<HI>Germany,</HI> to acquire the Modern Tongues in 1576. In 1585, was &s;ent by
the Queen to &s;everal <HI>German</HI> Princes, to procure their Aid for the
King of <HI>Navarre.</HI> Al&s;o to <HI>Hen|ry</HI> III. of <HI>France,</HI>
both for this King's Advantage and that of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Cau&s;e.
In 1588 was &s;ent to the <HI>Hague,</HI> and there admitted one of their
Council of State, and acquitted him&s;elf in his Charge, &s;o much to the
Queen's Satisfaction, that thenceforward he rarely received any
<HI>In&s;tructions</HI> in <PB N="241" REF="270"> the&s;e Proceedings of State.
After his return from near five Years Foreign Employment, he was &s;ent to the
<HI>Hague</HI> again but return'd in le&s;s than a Year: Yet was no &s;ooner
come home, but the Queen pleas'd with his Di&s;coveries, &s;ent him again to
the <HI>States,</HI> with Charge to pur&s;ue, what he had &s;ecretly propos'd;
whereby all was brought to the I&s;&s;ue de&s;ir'd. In all which Employments,
he had no one more to his Friend among the Lords of the Council, than the
Trea&s;urer <HI>Burghly,</HI> who was of Opinion there was no Man &s;o &s;it
for the Office of Secretary of State, and who&s;e Intention was, when he
advanced his own Son thereto, to make Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> his Collegue. But
before he return'd from the <HI>United Provinces</HI> in 1597, the Earl of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Cecils,</HI> had &s;o prodigally
recommended his Sufficiency to the Queen for the Po&s;t afore&s;aid, that &s;he
(who hated the Earl's Ambition) was not the readier to prefer him, tho' they
were to be jealous of him. Thus finding his Preferment on this Quarter
ob&s;tructed, and con&s;idering what a &s;lender hold|fa&s;t the Earl had with
the Queen; withal his declining Years, and the ea&s;y Circum&s;tances of his
own Fortune, he re&s;olv'd to retire; and tho' he had afterwards, both in the
Queen's Reign, and King <HI>James</HI>'s, many honourable Invitations, as well
to Foreign as Dome&s;tic Employments, he concluded at la&s;t <HI>to &s;et up
his Staff at the Library Door in Oxon,</HI> and ac|commodate that ruin'd Place
for the Public U&s;e of Stu|dents; finding him&s;elf competently furni&s;h'd
with the fourfold Aid nece&s;&s;ary thereto, which was a Knowledge in the
Learn|ed and Modern <HI>Tongues,</HI> as well as &s;undry kinds of
Scho|la&s;tic Literature; a <HI>Pur&s;e-Ability</HI>; Store of Honourable
<HI>Friends,</HI> and <HI>Lei&s;ure</HI> to follow the Work: But how well he
has &s;ped; he thinks that which is already perform'd in &s;ight, that which
be&s;ides he has given for the Maintenance of it, and which he afterwards
purpo&s;es to add, will &s;o abundantly te&s;tify, that he needs not be the
Publi&s;her of the Worth of his own In&s;titution. Written, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
1609. Signed <HI>T. B.</HI> Then follows:</P>
<P>Sir THOMAS BODLEY's <HI>fir&s;t Draught of the</HI> STATUTES
<HI>of the</HI> PUBLICK LIBRARY <HI>at</HI> OXON, <HI>tran&s;cribed</HI> from
the <HI>Original</HI> Copy, written by his own <HI>Hand</HI> and repo&s;ited in
the <HI>Archives</HI> of the &s;aid <HI>Library.</HI> Herein, upon the
Con&s;i|deration that no In&s;titution can have the good Effects in|tended,
unle&s;s there be Statutes to encounter and re&s;train the Di&s;orders of
ill-affected Per&s;ons, it is ordain'd, by the Chan|cellor, Vice-Chancellor,
Doctors, Proctors, Ma&s;ters, Re|gents, <PB N="242" REF="271"> <HI>&amp;c</HI>
of the great Convocation of the Univer&s;ity upon their frequent Con&s;ultation
with Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> That &s;ome one be deputed to the keeping of this
Library, who is a diligent Student, Tru&s;ty, Active and Di&s;creet; a
Graduate, a Lin|gui&s;t, unmarried and unbeneficed. That the manner of
e|lecting &s;uch a <HI>Keeper,</HI> &s;hou'd be like that yearly practis'd in
the choice of their Proctors; and fir&s;t the Electors to be tender'd one Oath,
then the Elected another, which are here &s;pecified. That the &s;aid Keeper is
not to be di&s;placed but by his own A&s;&s;ent, unle&s;s for &s;ome heinous
Offence or apparent In&s;ufficiency. That his Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall be to keep
and con|tinue the great Regi&s;ter-Book, chain'd to the Desk at the upper
Window of the Library, in which are to be inroll'd the Names of Benefactors
thereto, whether mean Per&s;ons or great: Which Book to be fairly written, and
laid to open &s;ight, as a Token of thankful Acceptation and Inducement of
Imitation to Po&s;terity. He is further al&s;o to range all his Books according
to their Faculties, to a&s;&s;ign to every Family its Catalogues and Tables,
di&s;po&s;e of the Authors therein named Alphabetically, and be&s;ides their
Names and Title of their Works, expre&s;s in what &s;ized Volume printed, the
Place where, and the Year when. Upon Gifts of Books to the Library, what Order
to be taken, that they be put up in good plight, and the Charge to be
&s;upply'd by the Vice-Chancellor, (Receiver of the Library Rents) and upon
Gifts in Money; how it is to be di&s;po&s;ed of to the Donors &s;atisfaction.
That for the Accommodation of Students, the Keeper is not to be exempted one
whole Day in the Year upon Penalty of 20 Shillings, except <HI>Sunday,
Chri&s;tmas-day,</HI> and &s;ome others here named: But to come con&s;tantly to
the opening of the Library Doors, and give acce&s;s to others from Eight to
Eleven in the Morning, and Two till Five in Afternoon, from <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI>
to <HI>Michaelmas</HI>; but the re&s;t of the Year, from One to Four in the
Afternoon; a Warning-Bell to be rung at his Ingre&s;s and Egre&s;s. None to
enter by Night, with Candle, Lamp, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Next, of the care to be
taken by Students in reading the Books, fa&s;tning the Cla&s;ps and Strings,
untangling the Chains, and leaving the Volumes in the Places they found them.
And for the &s;maller Volumes within the Grates, and under the Cu&s;tody of the
Keeper a|lone, he is to deliver them out by Hand and Tale, and with Condition,
that they be peru&s;ed in &s;ight, and pre&s;ently re|&s;tor'd to him or his
A&s;&s;i&s;tant, who is to look out and deliver Books &s;o ask'd for, and but
&s;ix at a time of one &s;ort or <PB N="243" REF="272"> other, unle&s;s he be
won to gratify &s;ome Per&s;ons to exceed that Number. No Books to be lent out
of the Library upon any Security whatever; and in Ca&s;e of Books to be &s;old
as unprofitable, or chang'd for better Editions, or carri|ed out to be new
bound, the Keeper to con&s;ult the Over|&s;eers to be appointed. The Keeper's
Ab&s;ence to be di&s;pen&s;|ed with in ca&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;even Days
every Quarter; but his Office to be &s;upply'd by &s;ome able Graduate, who is
of known Fidelity, or &s;hall take the Oath. And if the Ca&s;e is &s;uch, that
longer Ab&s;ence is allow'd by common Suffrage in Convocation, to be accorded
with. For this continual At|tendance and Engagement, the Keeper tho' he has
greater Advantages to advance his Knowledge and Credit than o|ther Students, is
to have, be&s;ides the Annual Stipend of 20 <HI>Nobles,</HI> which was the
Donation of King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. i&s;&s;uable from the Univer&s;ity
Trea&s;ure, 33 Pounds, 6 Shillings and 8 Pence, and to be paid half-yearly out
of the Library Re|venue, and his A&s;&s;i&s;tant Ten Pounds; and Four Pounds
more to a poor Scholar or Servant, for &s;weeping, wiping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The
choice of the&s;e to be at the Keeper's Di&s;cretion, their Payment at the
Vice-Chancellor's care, and di&s;placing of them in the power of the
Over&s;eers. That for the &s;afer Cu|&s;tody of the Revenue afore&s;aid, it
&s;hou'd be lock'd up where the Univer&s;ity Rents are kept, in an Iron
Che&s;t, under three different Locks, with double Keys, to remain with the
Vice-Chancellor and two Proctors; which la&s;t two are to be Witne&s;&s;es of
the Sums brought in or taken out and regi|&s;ter'd by the third. The Per&s;ons
to be admitted as <HI>Students</HI> are next di&s;tingui&s;h'd; be&s;ides all
Graduates, Benefactors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Strangers, or &s;uch as have no
Univer&s;ity Education, or been Contributors, may for the furtherance of their
Study obtain the Freedom of Recour&s;e; the &s;ame being craved as a Grace in
the Convocation Hou&s;e, and the Oath of Fideli|ty to the Library, here
exhibited, fir&s;t by them, as by all o|ther Per&s;ons, before the con&s;tant
Liberty of Entrance, ta|ken; and a Penalty impos'd upon tho&s;e who intrude
with|out Permi&s;&s;ion before they are &s;worn; unle&s;s accompanied with one
who is &s;worn; as al&s;o upon any who &s;hall be con|victed of di&s;membering,
purloining, or corrupting the Sen&s;e of any Books. Le&s;t the Keeper &s;hou'd
be tardy in his Duty, eight principal Graduates are appointed perpetual
Over&s;eers and Vi&s;itors of the Library, every 8th Day of <HI>November,</HI>
(the Day of fir&s;t opening or free Acce&s;s,) who are not only to examine how
well the Keeper has perfom'd his Charge, but <PB N="244" REF="273"> direct him
in doubtful Matters, and reform him in erroneous ones; al&s;o to appoint the
Exchange, or di&s;po&s;al of &s;uperflu|ous, and Purcha&s;e of new Books; and
to have forty Shillings for a Dinner or Supper that Day, al&s;o Gloves of Ten
Shil|lings a Pair, to the five Profe&s;&s;ors of the King's Lectures, and the
two Proctors, which two are al&s;o to have forty Shil|lings each, for the
Cu&s;tody of the Keys; one Pair of Gloves at five Shillings to the Beadle then
attending; one Pair of 20 Shillings to the Vice-Chancellor, with 20 Nobles in
regard of his Trouble, he only being to deal with the Employment of the Annual
Rents of the Library: Yet at the end of the Year to let the Vi&s;itors and
Keeper &s;ee the Money remain|ing in the Iron Che&s;t, with the Account of
Receipts and Disbur&s;ements, which they are to audit, &s;o deliver up his Keys
and Accounts to the New Vice-Chancellor, relating the State thereof, at the
next Convocation; who are to take notice of the la&s;t Vice-Chancellor's
Di&s;charge of his Tru&s;t, according to his Merit; and in all former Acts and
Decrees, expound, alter, abrogate, or innovate, and provide in all Events for
the Indemnity of the Library, as for a Trea&s;ure, to Students, of incomparable
Worth. So we come to</P>
<P>The LETTERS; which are 234 in Number; and mo&s;tly written by Sir
<HI>Thomas Bodley</HI> him&s;elf, from <HI>London, Ful|ham</HI> and
<HI>Burnham,</HI> to Dr. <HI>Thomas James,</HI> the fir&s;t Keeper of his
Library. Few of them have the Date of the Year when written, but the earlie&s;t
Date we meet with, is in 1602; to Dr.<HI>Rives,</HI> Vice-Chancellor of
<HI>Oxon,</HI> about open|ing the Library and con&s;tituting the Statutes
thereof, there|fore, perhaps, &s;hou'd have &s;tood the fir&s;t in this
Collection; and the late&s;t is dated in 1611. Though one, towards the end,
without any Date, was written much &s;ooner than the former, being to his
Cou&s;in <HI>Francis Bacon</HI> when he was a Youth in <HI>France,</HI>
containing Advice to him in his <HI>Travels</HI>; and the la&s;t Letter in the
Book is written to Dr. <HI>James,</HI> by <HI>Laurence Bodley</HI> after the
Death of his Brother Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> (which was in 1612.) Except another
Letter from Sir <HI>Tho|mas Bodley</HI> to the &s;aid Sir <HI>Francis
Bacon,</HI> which is al&s;o &s;ome|what Foreign to the&s;e Collections, as
containing both a Cen|&s;ure and Commendation of &s;ome Maxims of Modern
Philo|&s;ophy in his <HI>Novum Organum</HI>; that which the Reader is to look
for in the&s;e Letters, might be &s;orted and compre|hended under the&s;e five
Topics. The <HI>Founder</HI>; the <HI>Bene|factors</HI>; the <HI>Books</HI>;
the <HI>Library,</HI> and the <HI>Librarian:</HI> But we, for the Reader's
Facility of finding the Particulars here <PB N="245" REF="274"> extracted,
&s;hall give a tran&s;ient View of the mo&s;t ob&s;ervable among them, in the
&s;ame Order as they occur; which, tho' in the Collection it&s;elf, &s;hort,
di&s;&s;ever'd, often repeated, and unconcluded in many Points, as the Nature
is of Occa|&s;ional Letters, in &s;uch familiar Intercour&s;e; yet may yield
many Hi&s;torical Hints, relating to the Encouragers of this Foundation, or the
manner of collecting and pre&s;erving the Writings of Learned and Ingenious
Men.</P>
<P>Such therefore are the <HI>Founder's</HI> Expo&s;tulations with
his <HI>Librarian,</HI> upon his &s;udden thoughts of a married Life; the
&s;ame being utterly deny'd; al&s;o concerning the Advantages he had of
improving his <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and the Opportunities there might be of
augmenting his <HI>Salary</HI>; his Notice of &s;e|veral Benefactors, as Mr.
<HI>Hariot</HI> the Mathematician, Mr. <HI>Haidock,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ridley,</HI>

<HI>Tran&s;criber,</HI> and of <HI>Duplicate</HI> Copies; Ad|vice about making
the <HI>Catalogues,</HI> and adverti&s;ing each other of &s;uch Books as were
given or new bought, and not to let the knowledge of defective Copies be
divulged. Of the Cour&s;e to be taken with &s;uch as had been
<HI>Promi&s;ers</HI> of Con|tributions, but no <HI>Performers.</HI> Further
Advice about the <HI>Catalogue,</HI> as when divers Authors are bound in one
Volume, not to bury them all under the Name of the fir&s;t Author, but to name
every Author di&s;tinctly in his proper Letter of the Alphabet, and to place
the Name before, not after the Title of the Book. Notice of the Arrival of many
Books from <HI>John Bill</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI> and more expected. The
Foun|der's Approbation of a Table to enli&s;t the Names of Bene|factors and
their Gifts, till the Regi&s;ter be fini&s;hed. The Lord <HI>Trea&s;urer's</HI>
Donation of an Hundred Pounds unto the Library. The Founders Con&s;ent that any
Gentleman Stranger, after reque&s;t to the Congregation, and taking the Oath,
may have free Acce&s;s to the Library. That <HI>John Bill</HI> had bought Four
Hundred Pounds worth of Books a|broad. That &s;uch as give only a little Book
or two, may not expect to be recorded on the Regi&s;ter. That the Lord
<HI>Cobham</HI> had given Fifty Pounds to the Library, and pro|mis'd divers
MSS. out of St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI>'s Library in <HI>Canter|bury.</HI> The
Founder's Suppo&s;al that there are not to be had Twenty Pounds worth of the
Books of Prote&s;tant Writers, which he has not already, and that of tho&s;e in
Folio, thinks they have all that can begotten. His Opinion about &s;orting and

in Order at the opening of the Library. His Advice how the Librarian &s;hould
receive Sir <HI>John Forte&s;cue,</HI> &s;uita|ble to his Dignity and De&s;ert.
Concerning the <HI>Frankfort</HI> Catalogues of Books, containing all from 1564
to 1592, and another from thence to 1600, al&s;o in 4<HI>to.</HI> The Bi&s;hop
of <HI>Durham</HI>'s Promi&s;e of Fifty Pounds. The Founder's Opi|nion what

<HI>Northum|berland,</HI> who gave an Hundred Pounds; to Sir <HI>Walter
Ra|leigh,</HI> who gave Fifty Pounds; and to Sir <HI>Edmund Udal,</HI> who gave
as much to the Library; with Intimations in the &s;ame Letter of the King's

Some mention of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Gift, and Sir <HI>Robert
Sidney</HI>'s, and Mr. <HI>Barkham</HI>'s. The Founder's Opinion that there
&s;hou'd be no Vacation at all in the Library; but that the Keeper being
ab&s;ent up|on urgent Occa&s;ions, another might &s;upply his room till he
return, in regard of the Time good Students wou'd lo&s;e. A rea&s;on for
binding &s;undry Authors together, that the mul|tiplicity of Chains might not

<HI>Southampton</HI>'s Gift of an Hun|dred Pounds to the Library. The Founder's
Character of him&s;elf, as to matters of Literature, in the&s;e Words: 
<Q REND="inline">"As touching your Title-Page and your Epi&s;tle, I

Librarian's Catalogue of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Books. The Founder's Opinion for
excluding Almanacks, Plays, and Numbers more daily printed, hardly one in forty
being worth keeping. That in other Nations, <HI>Plays</HI> may be more
e&s;teem'd for learning the Languages, and being compiled by Men of Wi&s;|dom
and Learning, &s;eldom the Ca&s;e among us; and tho' &s;ome little Profit might
be reaped from &s;ome Play-Books, it will not countervail the Scandal they will
bring on the Li|bary, when it &s;hall be given out, it is &s;tuff'd with

<HI>William Roper</HI> (who gave the Works of Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI>) Mr.
<HI>Hakewell,</HI> &amp;c. men|tion'd by the Founder. His further Enquiries
after Dr. <HI>How&s;on,</HI> and Opinion that he &s;hou'd be &s;everely

<P>He then opens his <HI>Preface,</HI> to Sir <HI>John Holland,</HI>
Bart. with the Grand Divi&s;ion of <HI>Law,</HI> into <HI>Divine</HI> and
<HI>Natu|ral</HI>; and &s;hews that the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>England</HI> comes
neare&s;t to the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> and the <HI>Divine</HI>
Pattern. Next he treats of its <HI>Certainty</HI>; proving that <HI>legal
Beings</HI> in general, are capable of the be&s;t <HI>Certainty,</HI> even
Demon&s;tration, and Mr. <HI>Lock</HI>'s Notions of <HI>Morality</HI>
applicable to them; and after &s;hews the &s;pecial Care of the Law of
<HI>England,</HI> in defi|ning Terms, rai&s;ing Axioms, drawing Deductions
there|from, &s;earching the Truth of Facts by Juries of 12 Men, and giving
Judgment upon mature Con&s;ideration: Then of its Antiquity; and here he cites
our Author <HI>de Laud. Leg. Angl.</HI> that neither the <HI>Roman</HI> nor
<HI>Venetian</HI> Laws can claim &s;o great Antiquity; and lays down, that all
Laws have their <HI>Origin</HI> from <HI>Nature,</HI> and tho&s;e that are
founded on her are equally ancient; that the Law of <HI>England</HI>
con&s;i&s;ts of the Laws of <HI>Nature,</HI> po&s;itive
<HI>In&s;titutions,</HI> and <HI>Cu&s;toms.</HI> That <HI>Ethelbert</HI> the
fir&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian King,</HI> in 561, with the Advice of his
<HI>Wi&s;e-Men,</HI> made the fir&s;t <HI>Saxon</HI> Laws, after the coming of
<HI>Au&s;tin</HI> the Monk; and many <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings after him in like
manner, made and confirmed Laws; that <HI>Al|fred,</HI> fir&s;t &s;ole Monarch
after the <HI>Heptarchy,</HI> with the Ad|vice of his <HI>Wi&s;e-Men,</HI>
collected the Laws of former <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings into one entire
<HI>Codex</HI> (&s;uppos'd to be the &s;ame with the <HI>Dome-Book</HI>) <HI>ut
in Jus Commune totius Gentis tran&s;iret</HI>; that his Succe&s;&s;ors
<HI>Edward</HI> the Elder, <HI>Aethel&s;tan, Edgar, Ethelred,</HI> and
<HI>Canutus</HI> confirmed the&s;e Laws, and com|manded their Judges to give
right Judgment according to the <HI>Dome-Book,</HI> and that the
<HI>Folc-Right</HI> &s;hould be pre&s;erv'd to all their Subjects: And from
hence the Editor concludes, that the <HI>Common Law</HI> of <HI>England</HI>
under the Name of <HI>Folc-Right,</HI> exi&s;ted under <HI>Alfred</HI>; and
that <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;|&s;or only collected, as <HI>Alfred</HI> had
done, the Laws then extant, which had not been ob&s;erved during the
U&s;urpations of <PB N="252" REF="281"> <HI>Harold</HI> I. and
<HI>Hardicanute,</HI> and may well be called the Re|&s;torer of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Laws; and this he backs with the Oath of <HI>William</HI> I.
to keep inviolable the Laws of the pious Kings of <HI>England,</HI> and
e&s;pecially King <HI>Ed|ward,</HI> which, &s;ays he, were not only tho&s;e
enacted in his time, but of all his Ance&s;tors, and the with Confirmation of

<HI>Richard</HI> I. <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> III. and <HI>Magna
Charta,</HI> which as Lord <HI>Coke</HI> ob|&s;erves, is only a Confirmation of
the <HI>Common Law</HI> of <HI>Eng|land:</HI> He then &s;peaks of the
<HI>Salic</HI> Laws among the <HI>German Franks,</HI> and briefly of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution. After|wards he pa&s;&s;es to the Author's
Life and Character, his Pe|digree and Works. Then follows, the Rea&s;on of his
Re|marks on the Author's Language; and here he ob&s;erves, that

upon the Courts of the <HI>King's-Bench</HI> and the <HI>Common-Pleas,</HI> and
a Third upon the <HI>Exchequer</HI>; of which la&s;t, this, before us, is
pre&s;umed to be a Copy. It was certainly wrote by an Author who was familiarly
acquainted with the Laws of this Court, or Cour&s;e of Practice therein, both
Ancient and Modern; and that it was written &s;ince Mr. <HI>Maddox</HI>
pub|li&s;h'd the <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Exchequer,</HI> appears by our Author's
frequent Quotations from it; be&s;ides, there is the Form of a Writ of
<HI>Scire Facias</HI> i&s;&s;ued under the <HI>Te&s;te</HI> of the &s;aid Chief
Baron <HI>Gilbert,</HI> in the fourth Year of his late Maje&s;ty's Reign,
recited in the 56th Page of the &s;aid MS; which was imparted to us out of the
Collections mention'd in our Account of the MS, we de&s;cribed in our last
Number.</P>
<P>It is divided into Ten Chapters, which for want of room we &s;hall
only repeat, as follows: 1. Shewing that the <HI>Exchequer</HI> was the ancient
and &s;overeign Court in <HI>Normandy.</HI> 2. How to under&s;tand the Revenue
and Bu&s;ine&s;s of the ancient <HI>Ex|chequer.</HI> 3. How, when
<HI>Baronies,</HI> towards the latter end of the Norman Period e&s;cheated,
they were wont to be broken in|to &s;mall Tenures. 4. That, in the
<HI>Saxon</HI> Times, the Lords Spi|ritual held by <HI>Frank Almoigne.</HI> 5.
How the King's Tenants, who held <HI>per Baroniam,</HI> did Suit and Service at
his own Court. 6. How all Debts to the King bind from the Time they are
contracted. 7. What Acts and In&s;truments pa&s;s by the King's Chancellor
under the Broad-Seal. 8. The u&s;ual Revenue which aro&s;e from Fines and
Amerciaments. 9. The Receipt of the <HI>Exchequer.</HI> 10. The Sheriffs
Accounts; and with this, concludes the Treati&s;e, at lea&s;t as far as our
Copy extends.</P>

as to have had as many, if not more Editions than any other of his Wri|tings.
This Edition we make u&s;e of, is not mentioned in the Author la&s;t quoted;
and its having the Date of 1534, in the ornamental Border, from a wooden Print,
in the Title-Page, gives room to conjecture the Book was fir&s;t printed that
Year.</P>
<P>It is dedicated by the Author to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and in
his &s;aid Proheme, or Dedication, he has the&s;e Words, which verify in part
what we have above ob&s;erved, and at the &s;ame time &s;hew you the &s;ubject
Matter of his Work. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have now enterpry&s;ed to di&s;cribe, in our
Vulgare Tonge, the Forme of a ju&s;t publike Weale; which Mattier I have
gathered, as well of the Saiyings of mo&s;t noble Autors, (<HI>Greekes</HI> and
<HI>Latines</HI>) as by myne owne Experience; I being continually trained in
&s;ome daielye Affaires of the publicke Weale of this your mo&s;t noble Realme,
almo&s;t from my Childhood; which Attemptate is not of Pre&s;ump|cion to teache
any Per&s;on, I my&s;elf having mo&s;t nede of teachyng; but only to the entent
that Men, which will be &s;tudious about the Weale publyque, may find the
thynge thereto expedient, compendiou&s;ly written. And for as muche as this
pre&s;ente Boke treateth of the Education of them, that hereafter maie be
deemed woorthy to be <HI>Go|vernours</HI> of the publike Weal under your
Highne&s;&s;e, which <HI>Plato</HI> affirmeth to be the fir&s;t and chief Parte
of a Publike Weal; <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;aiynge al&s;o, where Governours be not,
the People &s;hall falle into ruine; I therefore have named it the
<HI>Governour,</HI> and do now dedicate unto youre Hyghe|ne&s;&s;e, as the
fyr&s;t Fruits of my Study, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>After the Table of Contents, our Author enters upon his Work,
which is divided into Three Books, with explaining the Signification of a
Publick Weal, and why it is called in <HI>Latin Re&s;publica</HI>; giving the
Rea&s;on of Government, and &s;hewing why Man, for his Under&s;tanding, and the
Honour which is due to it, is be&s;t fitted for the &s;ame. Further, that one
Sovereign Governor ought to be in a Publick Weal; and what Damage hath
happened, when a Multitude has had <PB N="263" REF="292"> equal Authority,
without any Sovereign? This is il|lu&s;trated by many Examples, e&s;pecially
from our own Hi|&s;tory of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Inva&s;ion and Divi&s;ions of
this Kingdom, till it was reduced to its primitive E&s;tate, by the noble King
<HI>Edgar:</HI> But here not propo&s;ing to de&s;cribe the Office or Duty of a
<HI>Sovereign</HI> Governor, he di&s;tingui&s;hes his In|tention to treat of
the two Parts of a Publick Weal, named due <HI>Admini&s;tration</HI> and
nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Occupation,</HI> which &s;hall be divided into two Volumes. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the fir&s;t, &s;aith he, &s;hall be
comprehended the be&s;t Form of Education or bryng|ing up of noble Children
from their Nativitie, in &s;uch manner, as thei may be found worthy, and al&s;o
able to be Governours of a Publyke Weale. The &s;econd Volume, which God
grantyng me Quietne&s;e and Libertee of Minde, I will &s;hortly after &s;ende
forth: It &s;hall conteyn all the Remenant which I can, either by Learnyng or
Experience, find apt to the Perfection of a ju&s;t Publike Weale; in which, I
&s;hall &s;o endeavour my&s;elf, that all Men, of what A&s;tate or Condicion
&s;oo ever thei bee, &s;hall fynde therin Occa&s;ion to be alwaie vertuou&s;ly
occupied, and not without plea&s;ure, yf they be not of the Schools of
<HI>Ari&s;tippus,</HI> or <HI>Apitius</HI>; of whom, the one &s;uppo&s;ed
Feli|citee to bee onely in Lecherye; the other, in delicate Feedynge and
Gluttonye; from who&s;e &s;harpe Talones, and cruelle Teethe, I be&s;eeche all
gentyll Readers to defende the&s;e Warkes, which for theyr Commoditee is only
compiled."</Q> Then he proceeds to ob&s;erve in the third Chapter, That in a
Publick Weal there ought to be inferior Governors, called
<HI>Magi&s;trates,</HI> which &s;hould be appointed, or cho&s;en by the
Sovereign Governor. In the next Chap|ter, he treats of the <HI>Education</HI>
or Form of bringing up the Children of Gentlemen, which are to have Authority
in the Publick Weal: &s;o proceeds to the Order of <HI>Learning,</HI> that
Noblemen, in their Minority, &s;hould be trained to, and at what Age
<HI>Tutors</HI> &s;hould be provided, and what belongs to their Office. In what
wi&s;e <HI>Mu&s;ick</HI> may be nece&s;&s;ary to a Nobleman. The Commendation
of <HI>Painting</HI> and Carv|ing in a Gentleman. The exact Care required in
chu&s;ing of <HI>Ma&s;ters.</HI> The Order to be u&s;ed in Learning, and which
Authors to be fir&s;t read. The Rea&s;ons why Gentlemen at this time be not
equal in Doctrine to the ancient Noblemen, which are Pride, Avarice, and
Negligence of Parents, with the want or &s;carcity of &s;ufficient Ma&s;ters or
Tutors. Here we have a Character of <HI>Henry Beauclerk,</HI> King of
<HI>England,</HI> <PB N="264" REF="293"> and his Brothers: Al&s;o a
Commendation of <HI>Eloquence</HI> and of <HI>Poetry,</HI> with Tran&s;lations
of &s;ome Ver&s;es from the ancient Poets, &s;hewing what good Advice, even the
wanton Wri|ters often contain; and that it were no Rea&s;on, for &s;ome little
matter that is in their Ver&s;es, to abandon therefore all their Works. 
<Q REND="inline">"No wi&s;e Man entreth into a Gardein, (&s;ais our
Author) but he &s;oon e&s;pieth good Herbes from Net|tils, and treadeth the
Nettils under his fete, whiles he gadreth good Herbes, whereby he taketh no
damage; or if he be &s;tungen, he maketh light of it, and &s;hortly forgetteth
it: Semblably if he do rede wanton Metter myxte with Wi&s;edome, he putteth the
wor&s;t under fote, and &s;orteth out the be&s;t; or if his Courage be &s;tered
or provoked, he remembreth the litteil Plea&s;ure and great Detriment that
&s;hulde en&s;ue of it, and withdrawyng his Mynde to &s;ome other Study or
Exerci&s;e, &s;hortly forget|teth it."</Q> From hence, we pa&s;s to the
<HI>Law,</HI> and &s;ome Ob&s;ervations upon the Improvements to be made in the
Study thereof. The Cau&s;e why, at this day, there be in this Realm &s;o few
perfect <HI>School-Ma&s;ters.</HI> Sundry Forms of <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI>
mentioned, as nece&s;&s;ary for every Gentleman; &s;ome of which are referred
to in <HI>Galen's</HI> Book, <HI>De Sanitate tuenda</HI>; 
<Q REND="inline">"which is tran&s;lated into <HI>Latine</HI>
wonderfull elo|quently, by Dr. <HI>Linacre,</HI> late mo&s;t woorthy
Phi&s;icion to our Mo&s;t Noble Soveraigne Lord Kyng <HI>Henry</HI> VIII."</Q>
And tho&s;e mentioned are <HI>Wre&s;tling, Running, Swimming,</HI> Art of
<HI>Defence, Riding</HI> and <HI>Vaulting</HI>; and here &s;peaking of
<HI>Hor&s;es</HI> he &s;ais, 
<Q REND="inline">"It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Ca&s;tle of

Erl of <HI>South|ampton,</HI> for a Monument of his Hor&s;e, named
<HI>Arundell,</HI> which in far Countries hadde &s;aved his Mai&s;ter from
ma|ny Perils."</Q> Then we come to the ancient <HI>Hunting</HI> of the
<HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI>; al&s;o of <HI>Hawking</HI>; and next of
<HI>Dancing</HI>; &s;hewing, that it is not all in general to be re|proved. The
Antiquity of Dancing, and wherefore in the good Order of Dancing, a Man and
Woman dance toge|ther. How Dancing may be an Introduction to the fir&s;t moral
Virtue, called Prudence. Of the Motions in Danc|ing, and what they are called;
as the <HI>Honour,</HI> the <HI>Braul</HI>; with an Explanation of the word
<HI>Maturity</HI>; the <HI>Singles</HI> and <HI>Reprin&s;e,</HI> or Indication
of Circum&s;pection, which gives our Author an Opportunity, under that
Con&s;ideration, to deliver a laudatory Character of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII.
Other Branches of Prudence are al&s;o further de&s;crib'd, from other 
<PB N="265" REF="294"> Motions or Steps in Dancing. This ends with a
Critici&s;m on the words <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cretion,</HI> not
hitherto known in the Engli&s;h Tongue, and of the word <HI>Man&s;uetude,</HI>
till this time, al&s;o unknown in our Tongue; with Rea&s;ons for na|turalizing
Words from the <HI>Romans,</HI> as they did from the <HI>Gre|cians.</HI> Hence
we pa&s;s to other Pa&s;times, expedient, if mode|rately u&s;ed. Here
<HI>Dicing</HI> is &s;hrewdly cen&s;ured, its ill Con&s;e|quences expos'd, and
the vicious Motives to it; with Ex|amples how contemptible it was held by the
Ancients. <HI>Cards</HI> and <HI>Tables</HI> are more favourably cen&s;ured, as
depend|ing more on Wit, and tru&s;ting le&s;s in Fortune; e&s;pecially were
&s;uch Improvements made in the&s;e kinds of Gaming, that Knowledge or Science
in higher things might thereby be advanced delightfully, and &s;o as to tender
Study mo&s;t commodious, whether in military Contentions, or tho&s;e between
Virtue and Vice, or any other laudable Invention. To this end, is the Game of
<HI>Che&s;&s;e</HI> commended, and as mo&s;t plea&s;ant to tho&s;e Players at
it, who have read the <HI>Moralization</HI> of it, and think thereof in their
Play; which Book is in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> but very &s;carce, becau&s;e few, in
their Play, &s;eek for Virtue or Wi&s;dom. Thus we come to <HI>Shoot|ing</HI>
in the Long-Bow, which he commends as the principal of all other Exerci&s;es,
not only for being more moderate, but more &s;erviceable; having been our
be&s;t Defence, and made us mo&s;t victorious, fam'd, and fear'd, as may be
&s;een in the Hi&s;tories of King <HI>Richard</HI> I. and King <HI>Edward</HI>
I. Hence our Author takes occa&s;ion to exclaim again&s;t the Decay of Archery
in his Time, and the Neglect of putting in Execution tho&s;e Laws and
Provi&s;ions which were made for re&s;toring the &s;ame: And here he concludes
the fir&s;t Book, containing 27 Chapters, and 84 Leaves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> Book begins with laying down &s;uch virtuous
<HI>Admonitions,</HI> as &s;hould be premeditated by whom&s;oever is appointed
a Governor of a Publick Weal; with &s;ome Ex|amples produced to prove, that as
the Governor is, &s;uch is the People; and more refer'd to in
<HI>Hi&s;tory</HI>; the Readers of which, our Author mo&s;t de&s;ires &s;hould
be, of all others, Princes and Governors. Tho&s;e Admonitions our Author would
have delectably written, and &s;et in a Table within the Governor's Bedchamber,
with tho&s;e Ver&s;es of <HI>Claudian</HI> to the Emperor <HI>Honorius</HI>
added, which he has here trans|lated, and of which we &s;hall give our Reader
only this Ta&s;te: 
<Q><PB N="266" REF="295"> 
<L>What thou <HI>may&s;t</HI> do, delight not for to know;</L> 
<L>But rather what thing will <HI>become</HI> thee be&s;t:</L> 
<L>Embrace thou Vertue, keep thy Courage low,</L> 
<L>And think that always Mea&s;ure is a Fea&s;t.</L></Q> And
ju&s;t before: 
<Q> 
<L>If Lu&s;t or Anger do thy Mind a&s;&s;ail:</L> 
<L>Subdue Occa&s;ion, thou &s;halt &s;oon prevail.</L></Q></P>
<P>Then proceeds he to the Expo&s;ition of <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> which
he calls 
<Q REND="inline">"The Fountain of all excellent Manners, the whole
Proportion and Figure of noble State; and is properly a Beauty or Comeline&s;s
in Countenance, Lan|guage and Ge&s;ture, apt to his Dignity, and accommodate to
Time, Place and Company; which like as the Sun doth his Beams, &s;o doth it
ca&s;t on the Beholders and Hearers a plea&s;ant and terrible Reverence,"
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Next, we have his Judgment and Advice about the
<HI>Apparel</HI> fit for a Nobleman, who is a Governor or great Coun&s;ellor;
al&s;o concerning the <HI>Furniture</HI> of his Hou&s;e; the Definition or
De&s;cription of true <HI>Nobility,</HI> and whence it took its Deno|mination;
in which Chapter he has this Allu&s;ion: 
<Q REND="inline">"We have in this Realm Coynes, which be called
<HI>Nobles</HI>; as long as thei be &s;ene to be Golde, thei be &s;o called;
but if thei be counterfeited and made in Bra&s;s, Coper or o|ther vile Mettall;
who, for the Print onely, calleth theim <HI>Nobles?</HI> wherby it appereth,
that the E&s;timation is in the Mettall, and not in the Print or Figure."</Q>
Hence he proceeds to the Prai&s;e of <HI>Affability,</HI> and the U&s;e thereof
in every State, more particularly in the Facility of Addre&s;s or being
&s;poken to; with Examples of the di&s;mal Condition of a Prince and his Realm,
where Liberty of <HI>Speech</HI> is re&s;train'd. The notable Virtue of
<HI>Placability</HI> is al&s;o here illu&s;trated; and here he gives us at
large, a dome&s;tick Example of this Vir|tue, comparable with the be&s;t that
ever was recorded of any other Princes or People, in the notable Story of King
<HI>Henry</HI> the IV. his Thank&s;giving to God, upon hearing that the
<HI>Prince of Wales,</HI> afterwards our renowned King <HI>Henry</HI> V. was
committed to Pri&s;on, and the Rea&s;on thereof; in that he was ble&s;s'd with
&s;uch a <HI>Judge,</HI> as feared not to ad|mini&s;ter, and &s;uch a
<HI>Son,</HI> as &s;corned not to obey <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>Thomas Elyot</HI> quotes no Authority for this curious
Story; and I recollect not any more ancient than his own, in this Book.
<HI>John Speed,</HI> in his <HI>Chronicle,</HI> quotes it from this Place. And
Dr. <HI>Fuller,</HI> tho' he mi&s;quotes our Author, as if it were from Sir
<HI>T. Elyot</HI>'s Chronicle (for no &s;uch Book did he ever publi&s;h) yet
&s;eems rightly to add, 
<Q REND="inline">"from whom our modern Hi&s;torians have
tran&s;cribed it."</Q> <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> in the &s;econd Part of his
<HI>Henry</HI> IV. has made a lively Scene of it for the Stage, and enlarged it
with Circum&s;tances, as a Dramati&s;t has a Licen&s;e to do. But
<HI>Stow</HI>'s Computation of the time which the <HI>Chief Ju&s;tice</HI>
con|cerned in this Story &s;at on the Bench, is ob&s;erved to have been too
much contracted; and <HI>John Tru&s;&s;el</HI>'s Account of King
<HI>Hen|ry</HI> the V. his Acknowledgment of the &s;aid Judge's Ju&s;tice, as
if he were alive, after the Coronation of that King, is ob&s;erved not to agree
with the time of the &s;aid Chief Ju&s;tice's Death. For Sir <HI>William
Ga&s;coigne</HI> was this Judge, who committed Prince <HI>Henry</HI> to
Pri&s;on, and he was made Chief Ju&s;tice of the King's-Bench, in the fir&s;t
of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. according to <HI>Fuller,</HI> as he a&s;&s;ures us from
our authentic Records, or 15 of <HI>November</HI> 1401, which was 3 of that
King, according to <HI>Dugdale</HI>; and died on the 17th of <HI>December,</HI>
in the 14th or la&s;t Year of that King, which was in 1412, according to the
Date on his Monument in <HI>Harwood</HI> Church in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and
the Pedigree of his Fa|mily, &s;till in being. What confirms the Truth of this
Story here above-mention'd is, That there is a Medal &s;truck in Com|memoration
thereof, an Impre&s;&s;ion of which I have &s;een. It is not &s;o broad as a
Guinea, has his Name written round it in the old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Characters,
with the Image of him&s;elf, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;itting on a Bench by another
Per&s;on, and reading to three Au|ditors before him. Mr. <HI>J.
Hopkin&s;on,</HI> in his MS. Volume of the <HI>Pedigrees of the York&s;hire
Gentry,</HI> has given us a Specimen of this Name's being &s;pell'd more
variou&s;ly than any other I ever met with. It is upon the &s;aid Medal Sir
<HI>Wylliam de Ga&s;quone,</HI> as I remember, but has &s;ince been mo&s;t
generally written <HI>Ga&s;|coigne</HI>; tho' <HI>Fuller,</HI> who was
acquainted with an accompli&s;hed Antiquary in <HI>Record-heraldry,</HI> of the
&s;ame Family, and Sur|name, writes him <HI>Ga&s;coinge.</HI></NOTE>. From
hence we pa&s;s to Arguments and Examples, &s;hewing <PB N="267" REF="296">
that a Governor ought to be merciful, with the difference between
<HI>Mercy</HI> and vain <HI>Pity.</HI> Here we have the choice Example of Mercy
&s;hewed by the Emperor <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> to his Enemy <HI>Lucius Cinna,</HI>
from <HI>Seneca.</HI> Then he de&s;cants upon the other principal Parts of
Humanity; the Excellency of <HI>Benevolence, Patience, Charity,</HI> adorn'd
with many anci|ent Examples. Of <HI>Beneficence, Liberality,</HI> and
<HI>Prodigality.</HI> The true De&s;cription of <HI>Friend&s;hip.</HI> The
wonderful Hi&s;tory of <HI>Titus</HI> and <HI>Gi&s;ippus,</HI> whereby is fully
declared the Figure of perfect Amity, with &s;ome Cautions to know a
<HI>Friend</HI> from a <HI>Flatterer.</HI> The Divi&s;ion of
<HI>Ingratitude,</HI> and the Di&s;prai&s;e <PB N="268" REF="297"> thereof,
with In&s;tances of Kindne&s;s in Bea&s;ts. Of the E|lection of Friends, and
the Diver&s;ity of <HI>Flatterers,</HI> illu&s;tra|ted al&s;o with ancient
Examples and Ob&s;ervations. That many <HI>Friends</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary for a
Governor: and herewith ends the <HI>Second Book,</HI> at the 141 Leaf,
containing 14 Chapters.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> and la&s;t <HI>Book,</HI> begins with a
Di&s;cour&s;e on the noble and mo&s;t excellent Virtue named
<HI>Ju&s;tice</HI>; whereupon it is ob&s;erved from whence the Name of King
fir&s;t pro|ceeded; the Di&s;tinctions between commutative and cor|rective
Ju&s;tice; &s;o proceeds to the fir&s;t Part of Ju&s;tice di&s;tri|butive. And
here is fir&s;t recommended the Love and Honour of <HI>God,</HI> and the
Example of the Gentiles in&s;tanc'd, who in &s;uch Honour placed the chief Part
of Ju&s;tice. This leads us to ob&s;erve the Tranquillity that is cau&s;ed by
<HI>Devo|tion,</HI> and to con&s;ider the Places con&s;ecrated for the &s;ame.
Here we have the Ju&s;tice of rai&s;ing <HI>Temples</HI> for that purpo&s;e,
and offering our Wor&s;hip therein with convenient <HI>Ceremonies.</HI> Next he
treats of the three Coun&s;ellors of Ju&s;tice, <HI>Rea&s;on, Society</HI> and
<HI>Knowledge,</HI> and of its two Enemies, <HI>Violence</HI> and
<HI>Fraud</HI>; with Examples &s;hewing, that Ju&s;tice ought to be between
Enemies. Di&s;tinctions of the Word <HI>Fides,</HI> which is the Foundation of
Ju&s;tice; as when it may be called <HI>Faith</HI>; when <HI>Credance</HI>;
when <HI>Tru&s;t</HI>; al&s;o when named <HI>Loyalty,</HI> according to the
<HI>French,</HI> or <HI>Fidelity,</HI> from the <HI>La|tin</HI>; with &s;everal
hi&s;torical Illu&s;trations of the &s;ame. Then we come to that Part of
<HI>Fidelity,</HI> which concerns the keep|ing of <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> or
<HI>Covenants:</HI> and here ends his Di&s;cour&s;e upon Ju&s;tice. So we enter
upon the noble Virtue of <HI>For|titude,</HI> and the two extreme Vices,
<HI>Audacity</HI> and <HI>Time|ro&s;ity</HI>: more particularly in what Acts
Fortitude con&s;i&s;ts; and that <HI>Painfulne&s;s</HI> is the fir&s;t
Companion of Fortitude, with ancient Examples verifying the &s;ame, according
to the Method hitherto pur&s;ued. Thus we come to his Recom|mendations of
<HI>Patience:</HI> Advice how it may be obtained, and a Remedy again&s;t
<HI>Impatience.</HI> Of Patience in &s;u&s;tain|ing <HI>Wrongs</HI> and
<HI>Rebukes</HI>; al&s;o in Repul&s;es, or Hinderance of <HI>Promotion,</HI>
with the Commodities which happen from the Advancement of good Men. Hence we
proceed to the Prai&s;e of <HI>Magnanimity:</HI> And in this Chapter, among
other Examples, we have that of King <HI>Edgar</HI>'s Treatment to the King of
<HI>Scots,</HI> who wondered, that him&s;elf, and other tall able-bodied
Princes and Commanders, &s;hould &s;uffer them|&s;elves to be &s;ubdued by
&s;uch a little Body as <HI>Edgar</HI> was: Proving, that by this Virtue, and
not by Chance, he was <PB N="269" REF="298"> preferred to the Sovereignty over
&s;o brave a People. Here follow the Vices attending this Virtue, &s;uch as
<HI>Ob&s;tinacy</HI> and <HI>Ambition. Ab&s;tinence</HI> and
<HI>Continence</HI> are next treated of, as the Companions of Fortitude; the
former e&s;pecially with relation to Rewards; with Examples &s;hewing, how
backward good Men have been again&s;t being led into the Bondage thereof; and
of the latter, we have al&s;o Examples in &s;everal eminent Per&s;ons. Next of
Con&s;tancy, Tempe|rance and Moderation. Of <HI>Sapience,</HI> and the
Definition thereof. The Signification of the <HI>Mu&s;es</HI>; of
<HI>Science</HI>; the <HI>Un|der&s;tanding.</HI> Of pa&s;t <HI>Experience,</HI>
and a Defence of <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> wherefore it is commendable, what it
&s;ignifies; with an An|&s;wer to the Objections of tho&s;e who would &s;light
the Ad|vantages thereof, becau&s;e it has been &s;ometimes corrupted with
fabulous Inventions. Next we are taught the other Part of Experience or
Practice, nece&s;&s;ary in the proper Per|&s;on of a Governor; and then, as a
Vice nece&s;&s;ary to be di&s;|couraged in Men in Authority, we have a
E&s;&s;ay upon <HI>De|traction,</HI> with a De&s;cription of the Picture which
<HI>Apelles</HI> painted thereof. La&s;tly, the three concluding Chapters are
upon <HI>Coun&s;el</HI> and <HI>Con&s;ultation,</HI> in what form they ought to
u&s;ed in a Publick Weale, and what therein ought to be chiefly con&s;idered.
As the Choice of good Coun&s;ellors, and Regard to be paid them; with the
Method of <HI>Belinger Balda&s;ine,</HI> to di&s;cover what would be the
Re&s;ult of Opinions in Council; and the Matter to be con&s;ulted of; in which
Generals are to be con&s;idered before Particulars: And with this Head
concludes the third and la&s;t Book of this pre|&s;ent Work; which Book
contains 30 Chapters, and the Volume ends with the Number of Leaves ob&s;erved
at the Beginning.</P>

tran&s;mit in Vo|lumes to Po&s;terity, &s;o many little, ob&s;ervable and
authentic Memoirs, as otherwi&s;e, for their Incongruity, could never have been
pre&s;erved; but for their U&s;e have been much prefer'd to our be&s;t
Libraries. In a Collection of this kind, there is all the Toil of writing,
which in a continued Hi|&s;tory is employed, but none of the Partiality; all
the U&s;e of Hi&s;tories compiled for the Pre&s;s, but none of the Profit: as
if only the Information of After ages were intended thereby; and all Prai&s;e,
Reward, or Memory of tho&s;e, who were In&s;trumental to it, &s;tudiou&s;ly
declined: For from the Generality of the&s;e Collections, which we have &s;een,
it &s;eldom does appear, otherwi&s;e than from what may be pre|&s;umed, as in
the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, who was the Collector, or the Scribe; or by whom, and for
what end they were &s;et to work; yet the end may be commonly under&s;tood in
mo&s;t of the&s;e Collections; &s;eeing many Particulars may be too well
<HI>known,</HI> or contain too much <HI>Truth,</HI> or be Matter of too
<HI>private</HI> a Concern, or need the further Illu&s;tration of
corre&s;ponding <HI>Authorities,</HI> to be put in print in their Collectors
own Time; but tran&s;mitted thus, in a <HI>Mi&s;cella|ny,</HI> or Clu&s;ter of
indifferent Matters, they are pre&s;erved, like Fruits that find a Safeguard in
their own Leaves, till they arrive at that Maturity, in which it is fit they
&s;hould be, oc|ca&s;ionally, gathered for publick U&s;e.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Collection, may, perhaps, as to &s;ome Parts of it,
be looked upon in this light. Tho' the Tran&s;criber's <PB N="271" REF="300">
Name does not directly appear, &s;everal Parts of the <HI>Collec|tion</HI> may
&s;ufficiently authori&s;e the <HI>Title</HI> we have drawn out for it, as
above. The Period of Time it relates to, may be comprehended between the Years
1584 and 1589; they being the earlie&s;t and late&s;t Dates we find therein;
and hence have we &s;ettled the Date in the &s;aid Title we have given it; as
believing nothing in the Book to be written below that Year. It begins with a
Letter from the Privy Council to the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> informing him
of her Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure, that the &s;ix hundred Foot, and thirty-two
Demilances to be levied for the Service in the North out of the County of
<HI>Salop,</HI> &s;hould be taken out of the trained Numbers only, in re&s;pect
of the pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ity, and the Importance of the Service wherein they
are to be employ'd; al&s;o cen&s;uring &s;ome Negligence in his Lord&s;hip's
Care for her Maje&s;ty's Service, touching the Certificates of his Deputy
Lieutenants of <HI>Salop</HI> and <HI>Wigorne</HI>; for that the Provi&s;ions
and Weapons they had &s;upply'd were nothing an|&s;werable to Expectation. And
further, de&s;iring his Lord|&s;hip's Opinion, if the contagious Sickne&s;s now
at <HI>Ludlow</HI> &s;hould continue, whether her Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;hold
&s;hould be removed to &s;ome other Place, and his Lord&s;hip not repair into
<HI>Wilts</HI> till it was over, &amp;c. This is the Sub&s;tance of the &s;aid
Letter, which is &s;ub&s;cribed with the Names of &s;ome Privy Coun&s;ellors;
but the Leaf is &s;o much damaged, and the Writing blinded by &s;ome Wet which
has befaln it, that all we can further read, and this with great Difficulty, is
the Name of <HI>Comptroller, Chamberlain</HI> and <HI>Wal&s;ingham</HI>; but
may gue&s;s, from the hazardous Times &s;poken of in it, that it was written at
the fir&s;t arming of the Nation again&s;t the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Inva&s;ion,
about the Year 1586. The next Piece, is a remarkable Letter from the Earl of
<HI>Leyce&s;ter,</HI> then Governour of the Low Countries, to Sir <HI>Thomas
Hennage,</HI> dated the 23d of September 1586, beginning thus: 
<Q REND="inline">"Sithens my other Letters of the 20th, yt fell
oute that ye&s;ter|day Morninge &s;ome Intelligence was broughte, that the
Enemie was bringing a Convoye of Victuall, garded with 300 Hor&s;e. There was
&s;ente out to ympeache yt, 200 Hor&s;e and 300 Footemen, and a Nomber more
both Hor&s;e and Foote to &s;econd them: Among other young Men my Nephew Sir
<HI>Philip Sydney</HI> was, and the rather for that the Coronell
<HI>Norrice</HI> him&s;elfe went with the Stande of Footemen, to &s;econd the
re&s;t; but the Van|gard of the Prince was marched and came with this Con|voye,
<PB N="272" REF="301"> and being a my&s;tie Morninge, our Men fell into the
Ambu&s;cade of Footemen, who were 3000, the mo&s;te Musketts, the re&s;te
Pykes. Our Hor&s;emen being for|mo&s;te by their ha&s;te indeede, woulde not
turne, but pa&s;te throughe and charged the Hor&s;emen that flede at the backe
of their Footmen &s;o valientlie, as albeyt they were 1100 Hor&s;e, and of the
verie Chieffe of all his Troupes, they brake them, being not 200. Many of our
Hor&s;es hurt and killed, among which was my Ne|phewes owne. He wente and
changed to another, and woulde needes to the Charge again, and on&s;te pa&s;te
tho&s;e Musketters; where he receyved a &s;ore Wounde upon his Thighe, three
Fingers above his Knee, the Bone broken quite in Peeces; but for whiche Chance,
God did &s;end &s;uch a Daye as I thinke was never many Yeres &s;eene, &s;o
fewe again&s;te &s;o many."</Q> Here the Earl proceeds to enumerate the
Commanders and other Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinc|tion in this Rencounter, who&s;e
Names were Colonel <HI>Nor|rice,</HI> who had the Charge of the Foot, my Lord
of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Perrot,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"and my unfortunate <HI>Phillip,</HI> &s;ais he,
with Sir <HI>William Ru&s;&s;ell,</HI> and divers Gentlemen, and not one hurte
but only my Nephew. They killed four of their Enemies chief Leaders, and
carried the valient Count <HI>Hannibal Gonzaga</HI> away with them upon a
Hor&s;e; al&s;o took Captain <HI>George Cre&s;ier,</HI> the principal Soldier
of the Camp and Captain of all the <HI>Albanez.</HI> My Lord
<HI>Willoughbie</HI> overthrew him at the fir&s;t Encounter, Hor&s;e and Man.
The Gentleman did acknowledge it him&s;elf. There is not a properer Gentleman
in the Worlde to|wards than this Lord <HI>Willoughbie</HI> is; but I can hardly
pray&s;e one more than another, they did all &s;o well; yet every one had his
Hor&s;e killed or hurt."</Q> And it was thought very &s;trange, 
<Q REND="inline">"that Sir <HI>William Stanley,</HI> with 300 of
his Men &s;hould pa&s;s in &s;pight of &s;o many Muskets, &s;uch Troops of
Hor&s;e, three &s;everal Times, making them remove their Ground, and to return
with no more Lo&s;s than he did. Albeyt, I mu&s;t &s;ay (continues the Earl) yt
was too much Lo&s;s for me, for this young Manne was my greate&s;te Comforte
next her Maje&s;tie of all the Worlde, and if I could buy his Lieffe with all I
have, to my Sherte, I woulde geve yt. How God will di&s;po&s;e of him I know
not, but feare I mu&s;t needes, greately, the wor&s;te; the Blow is in &s;o
dangerous a place, and &s;o great; yet did I never heare of any Manne that did 
<PB N="273" REF="302"> abide the dre&s;&s;inge and &s;ettinge his Bones better
than he did: And he was carried afterwards in my Barge to <HI>Arnheim,</HI> and
I heare this Daye he ys &s;till of good hearte, and comforteth all aboute him
as much as maye be. God of his Mercie graunte me his Lieffe, which I cannot but
doubt of greately. I was abrode that tyme in the Fielde, givinge &s;ome Order
to &s;upplie that Bu&s;ine&s;s, which did indure almo&s;te twoe Owres in
continuall Fighte; and metinge <HI>Phillip</HI> commynge upon his Hor&s;ebacke,
not a lytle to my Greafe. But I woulde you had &s;tode by to heare his mo&s;t
loyall Speeches to her Maje&s;tie; his con|&s;tant Minde to the Cau&s;e, his
lovinge Care over me, and his mo&s;te re&s;olute Determmation for Deathe, not
one Jott appalled for his Blow; which ys the mo&s;te greevous that ever I
&s;awe with &s;uch a Bullet; ryding &s;o, a longe myle and a halfe, uppon his
Hor&s;e, ere he came to the Campe; not cea&s;ing to &s;peak &s;till of her
Maje&s;tie; be|ing glad, yf his Hurte and Deathe mighte any waye ho|nour her
Maje&s;tie; for her's he was while&s;te he lyved, and God's he was &s;ure to be
yf hee dyed: Prayed all Men to thinke that the Cau&s;e was as well her
Maje&s;tie's as the Countrie's; and not to be di&s;coraged, for you have
&s;eene &s;uche Succe&s;&s;e as maye encorage us all; and this my Hurte is the
Ordinance of God, by the happe of the Warre. Well I praye God, yf yt be his
Will, &s;ave me his Lieffe; even as well for her Maje&s;tie's Ser|vice &s;ake,
as for myne own Comforte."</Q> The&s;e are the Earl's Words, concerning his
&s;aid worthy Nephew; and we thought it wou'd be excu&s;able to tran&s;cribe
thus parti|cularly all he has there &s;aid of Sir <HI>Philip Sidney,</HI> being
a Man of &s;uch particular Merit; even tho' it &s;hould oblige us to be the
more general and conci&s;e in &s;ucceeding Topicks. The re&s;t of the Letter,
above a Page of &s;mall Writing more in folio, relates to the Account of their
Enemies Retreat, the Pri&s;oners taken, and the chief <HI>Spaniards</HI> who
were at the Charge, with the Number of their Forces; the hazard|ous Enterprizes
of the Lord <HI>North,</HI> who tho' brui&s;ed on the Knee with a Musket-Shot,
yet leaving his Bed, ha&s;tned to this Skirmi&s;h, one Boot on and t'other off,
and went to the Matter very lu&s;tily: Al&s;o of two hopeful young Gentlemen in
the Camp, Mr. <HI>Hatton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Umpton,</HI> who were as ready in the
Service as the meane&s;t Soldiers, and got with their Pikes into their
Fore-ranks, under <HI>Row|land Yorke,</HI> to &s;econd Sir <HI>William

<Q REND="inline">"and till we &s;ee what the Prince will do,

<P>The next Piece may be entitled, <HI>Arguments for the &s;ud|den
Execution of</HI> Mary <HI>Queen of</HI> Scots. We have not Lei&s;ure now to
examine whether it has ever been printed, nor can we certainly &s;ay that the
Earl afore&s;aid was the Au|thor of it; therefore &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that
it here makes four Pages, and begins with the&s;e Words: 
<Q REND="inline">"It may &s;eeme a vayne Labor to goe about to

Nece&s;&s;itie, as yt were again&s;te all Rea&s;on any waye to thinke it mighte
be de&s;uaded."</Q> It is written in the &s;ame Hand with the former, and
followed by another Letter of the &s;aid Earl's writing, giving a further
Account to &s;ome Nobleman here in <HI>England,</HI> of their Succe&s;s in
winning a Town by Battery, and the Enemies yielding before A&s;&s;ault; in
breaking their Hor&s;emen in a mo&s;t valiant Skirmi&s;h; get|ting from their
Footmen two mo&s;t &s;trong Forts by A&s;&s;ault, and making them for&s;ake the
third by Night, the Prince him&s;elf being at hand with his whole Army; and
never at|tempting after the fir&s;t Skirmi&s;h to empeach them: Which he only
&s;peaks in general of here, expecting the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> or
&s;ome other that come over, will be more particu|lar. And now that the Prince
is retired, intends to di&s;mi&s;s his Army into Garri&s;on, and make a Skip
over to &s;ee his Friends, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Dated at the Camp, 14
<HI>Octo.</HI> 1586. After this, we have a Letter, &s;igned <HI>Richard
Hollande,</HI> to a noble Lord, intreating that his Lord&s;hip would be
pre&s;ent at the hearing of a Cau&s;e in the Star-Chamber, wherein his
Bro|ther-in-Law, Mr. <HI>Dokenfield</HI> was concerned: Tis dated from
<HI>Heaton,</HI> 3 <HI>May,</HI> 1586. And then follows, <HI>Queen</HI>
Eli|zabeth's <HI>Speech in Parliament,</HI> al&s;o the &s;ame Year,
<HI>con|cerning the Form of proceeding again&s;t the Queen of</HI> Scots; and
the Delay of her immediate An&s;wer to their Petition for the Execution of the
&s;aid Queen, till &s;he had fir&s;t, 
<Q REND="inline">"with earne&s;t Prayer, be&s;eeched his divine

E&s;tabli&s;hment of his Church, pre&s;ervation of their E&s;tates, and
Pro&s;perity of this Commonwealth under her Charge."</Q> This Speech
con&s;i&s;ts of four Pages and a half, and begins with the&s;e Words: 
<Q REND="inline">"The bottom|le&s;s Graces and immea&s;urable

have been &s;uch, as I mu&s;t not only acknowledge them, but al&s;o admire
them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q> The next is Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Speech, in
<HI>an&s;wer to the French Amba&s;&s;ador, Mon&s;ieur</HI> Believre, <HI>and
the re&s;t of his Company,</HI> ju&s;tifying her Proceedings again&s;t the
Queen of <HI>Scots.</HI> It begins thus: 
<Q REND="inline">"My Lords Amba&s;&s;adors, I tru&s;t &s;o much

Afflictions which ever I did receive, as concerning the Deaths of the King my
Father, the King my Brother, and the Queen my Si&s;ter, have not been &s;uch a
Grief unto my Heart as the Matter we &s;peak of. I call God to witne&s;s if
ever I would u&s;e her as &s;he hath done me: All this I take upon my Salvation
or Damnation. I have &s;een many Hi&s;tories, and read I be|lieve as many, I

like unto this. I re|member well your Di&s;cour&s;e, and all that you have
al|ledged unto me, but it cannot intice me to change my Will,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q> Then follows the mo&s;t &s;orrowful and de|&s;perate
Letter of <HI>Margaret,</HI> Queen of <HI>Navarre,</HI> to Mon|&s;ieur de
<HI>Sarlant,</HI> complaining of the Queen her Mother's abandoning her to
&s;hameful Ruin; and prote&s;ting, 
<Q REND="inline">"That as her Heart wou'd not let her fall into the
Hands of her Enemies alive, &s;he would never eat more; and that the first News

<HI>The Booke of the whole Navie,</HI> containing the Names of all the Queen's
Maje&s;tie's Shippes, with their Tonnage, and nomber of Mariners, Gun|ners and
Souldiers the 27 of <HI>December,</HI> 1585. From hence we learn the <HI>Royal
Navy</HI> then con&s;i&s;ted of 36 Ships; that the bigge&s;t, named the
<HI>Triumph,</HI> was of 1000 Tun Burden, carried 350 Mariners, 50 Gunners, and
200 Soldiers. Of the re&s;t, two were of 900 Ton, one of 800, one of 650, and
&s;even of 500, &s;o le&s;&s;ening down to 20 Ton &s;ome of them. This Li&s;t

Stories of Queen <HI>Joan</HI> afore&s;aid, who was deliberately executed by
<HI>Charles,</HI> King of <HI>Naples,</HI> thro' the Advice of <HI>Lewis</HI>
King of <HI>Hungary</HI>; and <HI>Conradine</HI> King of <HI>Naples,</HI> who

here we have a Book of this Queen's referr'd to, called <HI>Expetit.
Cau&s;a|rum,</HI> &amp;c. Then follows a &s;econd Precedent of an Em|peror,
<HI>Tiberius,</HI> who put the King of <HI>Thrace</HI> to death, as we have it
in <HI>Livy, Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI>: Al&s;o a third Pre|cedent in
the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> VII. who deprived <HI>Robert</HI> King of
<HI>Naples,</HI> and gave Sentence of Death again&s;t him. Nay, we have

affirm, giving their Judg|ment for the putting of Kings to death; as of Pope
<HI>Clement</HI> IV. again&s;t <HI>Conradine,</HI> King of <HI>Sicily</HI>;
al&s;o Pope <HI>Boniface,</HI> who put Pope <HI>Caele&s;tine</HI> to death,

<P>The next Piece is a Letter of a private Nature, from Sir

<HI>Liber Pacis</HI> 1584; or <HI>the Names of all the Ju&s;tices of
A&s;&s;ize</HI> in the &s;everal Counties of <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Wales.</HI> This Li&s;t, in double Columns, takes up 29 Leaves. After this,
<PB N="277" REF="306"> we have another Li&s;t, which is called al&s;o, <HI>a
Book of the Number, Names, and Burden of all the Ships, Barques, and
Ve&s;&s;els, with the Names of all Ma&s;ters and able Mariners belonging
thereto, within or appertaining to the River of</HI> Che&s;ter. It was written
by <HI>William Wale,</HI> the Mayor, at the Command of the Earl of
<HI>Derby</HI>; to whom it is addre&s;|&s;ed in an Epi&s;tle, by the &s;aid
Mayor; bearing Date 18 <HI>February,</HI> 1586; and it appears in the&s;e
Li&s;ts, that the Number of Ships, Barques, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the Burden of
twen|ty, to &s;ixty Tons, were fifteen in Number; and that the Owners,
Ma&s;ters, and Mariners, with the Places of their abode are named, and number'd
at 152. To this is joined, the like Account of all the Barques,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> belonging to the River of <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> (in
<HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI>) called the Water of <HI>Rible</HI>; and this is

Command of the &s;aid Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> he being Lord Lieutenant al&s;o
of this County, as appears by this Mayor's Letter to his Lord&s;hip. This
Li&s;t of Ve&s;&s;els is contained in one Page; and they are eight in Number,
from the Bur|den of four to ten Ton. The like Book or Li&s;t of all the
Ve&s;&s;els belonging to the River <HI>Wyer</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> as
well abroad as at home, with their Burden, Ma&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is
ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the &s;aid Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> according to his Com|mand,
the &s;ame Year, by <HI>Henry Butler,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and <HI>William
Skillicorne,</HI> Gent. The Number of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are 28, and the
Burden between four and eighteen Ton. This is followed with &s;uch another
Account of the Ve&s;&s;els, be|longing to the Peele of <HI>Foodre</HI> and the
Creeks thereof, in <HI>Fournes</HI> and <HI>Cartmeale,</HI> within the &s;aid

Bradley,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and <HI>John Richard&s;on,</HI> Gent. They are
but five Ve&s;&s;els in Num|ber, from the Burden of two to twenty Ton. And to
this is joined one more &s;uch Li&s;t of all the Ve&s;&s;els in the Port of
<HI>Liverpoole,</HI> in the &s;aid County, taken the &s;ame Year; with the
Names of the Places they were bound to; the Owners, Mariners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
They appear to be twenty-eight in Number, and from eight to forty Ton Burden.
Then follows a Note concerning the intire <HI>Sub&s;idy,</HI> and the two
<HI>Fifteenths</HI> and <HI>Tenths</HI> granted in Parliament; the fir&s;t
Pay|ment whereof was to be in <HI>November</HI> next (<HI>viz.</HI> 1587) and
the &s;econd in <HI>November</HI> 1588: With the Manner of appointing the
Collectors thereof. After this we have a <HI>Letter from Captain</HI> A.
Cosbye, dated at <HI>Utrecht</HI> the 16 <PB N="278" REF="307">
<HI>February,</HI> 1586, to Sir <HI>William Stanley</HI>; advi&s;ing him to

Government, or the Expectation of great Forces from the Prince to remove him;
as what will no doubt recover his Credit, Pardon, and her Maje&s;ty's Favour:
And offers him&s;elf to be employ'd into <HI>England</HI> to further this
Service. The next Paper is <HI>a Li&s;t of all the Soldiers and Munition in the

<P>After the&s;e Letters, we have the An&s;wer of <HI>Chri&s;topher

Sothworthe,</HI> and aged 31 Years) to &s;everal Articles again&s;t, and
Examinations of him; which An&s;wer he made before Dr. <HI>White,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Beacon, Rich. Topclyff,</HI> and <HI>Rich. Yonge</HI>; whereby it appears,
that he being earne&s;tly required to conform him&s;elf in Religion according
to the Laws of her Maje&s;ty, now e&s;tabli&s;hed, refu&s;ed utterly, &s;aying,

<Q REND="inline">"He is taught that Doctrine and Religion at
<HI>Rome,</HI> wherein he will &s;tand and hopeth to die."</Q> The&s;e
An&s;wers contain three Pages. Then follows two Letters by the Earl of
<HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> to Mr. <HI>Woolley</HI> afore&s;aid; both written from the
Low Countries. From the fir&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix Pages, we learn, That
Mr. <HI>Woolley</HI> had conveyed to her Maje&s;ty his Lord&s;hip's
Replications to the Lord <HI>Buckhur&s;t,</HI> Sir <HI>John Norris,</HI> and
<HI>Wylkes</HI>; and that he had advi&s;ed his Lord&s;hip not to be &s;evere in
following Revenge, for her Maje&s;ty hath them &s;till in her Di&s;plea&s;ure;
and they give it out that it is only for his Lord&s;hip's Cau&s;e. In this
Letter he fur|ther declares, they have Friends to help them to execute their
foul Facts; and he, few to help to deliver him in his <PB N="281" REF="310">
ju&s;t Defence: And asks what he &s;hould have been thought of if he had left
their Declaration unan&s;wered. That in what her Maje&s;ty has &s;pared them
for her&s;elf, they ought the more to acknowledge it, and what &s;he laid upon
them for his Sake, he is upon his Knees, with all Humblene&s;s, to yield mo&s;t
dutyful Thanks. As to his Succe&s;&s;or that is talked of, and whether he was
to be Governor General as his Lord&s;hip is, or only have the Government over
her Maje&s;ty's People there, he thinks it will &s;oon be re&s;olved; for that
the States have found &s;uch a &s;weet Ta&s;te in com|manding as well Men as
Money, that they will hardly yield to any more Governors till they mu&s;t by
force; therefore that it &s;hou'd be &s;een his Lord&s;hip would be the la&s;t.
We are here informed al&s;o, of the Di&s;pute his Lord&s;hip had with the
States, about the Payment of the 5000 Men he carried over with him. Al&s;o
concerning <HI>Sluce</HI> Haven, what he has written about it, and Mr.
<HI>Beal</HI> is to deliver. And that nothing can be done but by Count
<HI>Maurice,</HI> of who&s;e bad Dealing her Maje&s;ty doth know. That the Talk
of Peace holds all Things in &s;u&s;pence: That it is greatly pre&s;s'd by
&s;ome, to make it conceived, that it will be better for them&s;elves to deal
by them&s;elves, than to join with her Maje&s;ty; and herein doth
<HI>Maurice</HI> and <HI>Hollock</HI> join and practice for life again&s;t her,
as they have done ever &s;ince his Lord&s;hip came over; and that he &s;hall
hazard &s;ome|what to impeach their Doings, as he intends. And a lit|tle
further: 
<Q REND="inline">"What a Tyme of Faction I have &s;uffered! and now
more than ever; for that the A&s;&s;urance of Peace dothe drawe many from me
and my Authoritie, and &s;o falleth it out every Day more manife&s;te than

of <HI>Octob.</HI> 1587. The next Letter by the &s;aid Earl to the &s;ame
Per&s;on, informs us, That this Peace in hand begins to make great War in
tho&s;e Parts, for that none wou'd hear of it but &s;uch as wholly depend|ed on
her Maje&s;ty. And here he further expre&s;&s;es his Un|ea&s;ine&s;s under his
Charge, thus, 
<Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you my Lyffe was never weari&s;ome
to me till nowe: I woulde my E&s;tate here were eyther felte, hearde, or
under&s;tood; I knowe, of &s;o many profe&s;&s;ed Friendes as I have, I &s;hall

<HI>Horne</HI> in <HI>North Holland,</HI> and means to &s;tay a few Days
thereabouts; de&s;ires to be excu&s;ed to the Lords, for that all his
Secretaries are employ'd abroad; hopes to hear from him &s;peedily the
ble&s;&s;ed Sound of Retreat; that he is di&s;patching the Soldiers as fa&s;t
home as he can; that he tru&s;ts the Lords will con&s;ider how little Cau&s;e
he has to &s;tay there any longer, except, now he has worne out all his
Company, they intend he &s;hall weare out him&s;elf. So ends, in ha&s;te, the 9

<P>Then follow &s;ome more private Accounts, relating chief|ly to the
E&s;tates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> as we gather by
Circum&s;tances; beginning with <HI>a Note of the Particu|lars of my Lord's
Stand at</HI> Pilkington: This is an Inven|tory of the Goods or Furniture in
the Apartments there. The next Paper is <HI>an Account of Wood &s;old</HI>; in
this Method. The fir&s;t Column contains the Names of the Commi&s;&s;ion|ers;
the next, the Names of the Woods; the next, the Year when &s;old, and the
Valuation; next, the Earne&s;t Mo|ney; and la&s;tly, Earne&s;t Money received.
The&s;e Woods were named <HI>Stretlie, Gorynge, Burciter, Middleton</HI> and
<HI>Arn|cot; Whichford, Ardington, Brackley, Gade&s;den</HI> and
<HI>Wyn|nington:</HI> And the Sales were made between the 25 and 28th Years of
the Queen's Reign. To this is added, a &s;e|parate Paper of the <HI>Earne&s;t
of my Lord's Woods</HI> for tho&s;e Years, the Sum total whereof is 108
<HI>l.</HI> 9 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> To this is al&s;o join'd, <HI>an
Account of the riding Charges allowed by the Auditors to the Commi&s;&s;ioners,
for &s;ale of the &s;ad Woods</HI> in tho&s;e three Years. And this is followed
with <HI>Orders &s;et down by my Lord, for Earne&s;t Money due unto his
Lord&s;hip for the Sale of Woods.</HI> The&s;e Orders are agreed to by the
Commi&s;&s;ioners afore&s;aid, who&s;e Names are <HI>Tho. Harte, Edw. Clarke,
Jam. Kenwicke</HI> and <HI>Edw. Gunne:</HI> And the <PB N="283" REF="312">
Agreement is witne&s;&s;ed, among&s;t others, by <HI>Edward Rigby,</HI> Gent.
who is expre&s;&s;ed in the next Page to be a Receiver for the Earl of
<HI>Derby</HI> in the &s;outhern Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and who&s;e
Receipts we have here audited in the 28th of the &s;aid Queen's Reign; at the
End of which Account is mention|ed the Sale of the above&s;aid Woods in this
la&s;t mention'd Year, for upwards of 1200 <HI>l.</HI> Then follows a &s;hort
Bill of &s;ome yearly Payments. The next Paper is called <HI>a Note what
Lybertie Mr.</HI> Butler <HI>of</HI> Bew&s;ey <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> had by
Vertue of the Conveyance pa&s;&s;ed between the Earl of</HI> Leyce&s;ter
<HI>and him, to lymmit and appointe to his Wieffe or Wyves.</HI> The next is
entitled, <HI>Rygate in Com.</HI> Surrey; and contains the Particulars of three
Woods, that is, <HI>Erle</HI>'s Wood, de&s;cribed to be well &s;et with great
Oaks and Beeches, containing 240 Acres, valued at 3000 <HI>l. Petrydge</HI>
Wood, containing 30 Acres, valued at 207 <HI>l.</HI> 13 <HI>s.</HI> 4
<HI>d.</HI> and <HI>Raye</HI> Wood, con|taining 16 Acres, valued at 50
<HI>l.</HI> The next Memorial &s;eems to be a very curious and particular
Account of <HI>the whole yearly Revenue of the Kingdom of</HI> Spain: Fir&s;t,
be|ginning with the Revenues of all the <HI>States</HI> belonging to that
Crown: The Mines; Cu&s;toms of them, and of the <HI>Slaves</HI>; amounting to
above ten Millions, four Hundred Thou&s;and Duckets. Next, of the King's yearly
Pen&s;ion from the five Orders of <HI>Knighthood,</HI> and his Profits upon
be&s;towing the <HI>Encomendas</HI> belonging to three of them; with the
particular Names, Number, and Value thereof; where it appears, the whole Order
of St. <HI>James</HI> amounts to 385915 Duckets: The whole Order of
<HI>Calatrava</HI> to 254450 Duckets, including that of <HI>Monteza</HI>: The
whole Order of <HI>Alcantara</HI> to 171300 Duckets: Be&s;ides the Or|der of
St. <HI>John,</HI> at this time divided between Don <HI>Antonio de Toledo,</HI>
and the ba&s;e Son of the Duke of <HI>Alva.</HI> Fur|ther, that out of the
Rents of the three Orders of <HI>Encomen|das</HI> that King receives, as Great
Ma&s;ter, for his Part year|ly, two Hundred and &s;eventy Thou&s;and Duckets.
Then follows an Account of the yearly Charges which that King is at, amounting
to above &s;even Millions of Duckets; which compared with his Receipts leaves
him above two Millions eight hundred Thou&s;and clear.</P>
<P>Next, we come to a few Papers of more private or par|ticular
Concern again, as a <HI>Remon&s;rance to the Lord Chan|celler</HI> Hatton,
<HI>and Lord Trea&s;urer</HI> Burghley, with the re&s;t of the Council
a&s;&s;embled in the Court of Star-Chamber, again&s;t <HI>John Crapnell,</HI>
who was to have a Cau&s;e heard in this <PB N="284" REF="313"> Court; being a
violent Invective again&s;t him; per&s;uading, that he is, and has been, a
Rogue in all manner of Lights or Practices: But we here want the Conclu&s;ion
of it. After this we have an <HI>E&s;timate of the Livings of</HI> John
Salusburie of Lleweny, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI> in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and
Rever&s;ion. And the next is a very odd Story; entitled, <HI>The Confe&s;&s;ion
of</HI> Edw. Burnell: 'Tis compri&s;ed in &s;ix Pages, and the Sub&s;tance of
it is this; This Mr. <HI>Burnell,</HI> as appears by his own Com|plaint, had
met with hard U&s;age in the <HI>Court of Wards and Liveries</HI>; was turn'd
out of &s;ome Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and had brought his Adver&s;aries into the
<HI>Star-Chamber</HI> for Perjury and Forgery: But here, the Equity of his
Cau&s;e not being heard; he thought he had a right to &s;ay, her Maje&s;ty
want|ed <HI>faithful Hearts,</HI> to &s;ee, according to her Di&s;po&s;ition,
Ju&s;tice executed. Hereupon he prepares a <HI>New-Year's Gift</HI> for her
Maje&s;ty, which was a <HI>Latin</HI> Oration; but he was taken up and examined
before Sir <HI>George Carey</HI> and <HI>Ralph Lane</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the
very Day, yet &s;o early as two o'clock in the Morning, that he was to have
made his &s;aid Speech, which was <HI>January</HI> 1, 1586. This Examination we
have here, with that al&s;o of Mr. <HI>Burnell</HI>'s Servant, <HI>John
Cart|wright;</HI> and therein it appears, when they demanded what his
<HI>New-Yea's Gift</HI> was to be, he an&s;wer'd, he had it about him; &s;o
opening his Doublet, he &s;hewed his naked Brea&s;t, and &s;aid, that after
declaring to her Maje&s;ty his good Mean|ing towards her by the Oration he had
made in <HI>Latin,</HI> he would have ripped his Body as far as he cou'd, and
his Brea&s;t, &s;o far as he might, without Danger of Death, to have &s;hewn
her Maje&s;ty his Heart. They demanded, whom he acquainted with this Device? He
an&s;wered; he had advi&s;ed with <HI>Paul Warren</HI> and one <HI>Gyles,</HI>
two Surgeons; had asked them, whether a Man being ripped down the Body might
not yet live? They an&s;wer'd, hardly; but upon his impor|tuning
<HI>Warren,</HI> who was his Relation, he promi&s;ed, if he continued
re&s;olute, that he wou'd meet him at <HI>Greenwich</HI> (where the Court lay)
this Morning. Being required to &s;et down the Oration he meant to have
pronounced; al&s;o to give them an Account of what Places and Company he had
been in for eight Days before: He an&s;wered, by writing the &s;aid Oration
down, which we have here, in half a Page; with the Cau&s;es that moved him to
give this Gift; al&s;o the Particulars where, and with whom he had been,
&s;ince <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Day la&s;t. And thus much for Mr.
<HI>Burnell</HI>'s <HI>New-Year's Gift.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="314">This is followed with a Note of the
<HI>Mannor of Wyming|ton in Com. Bedford,</HI> the Rents and Parcels thereof,
as they have been letten before the Lea&s;e made to Mr. <HI>Edw. On|ley</HI> by
the Earl of <HI>Derby.</HI> A like Note we have here al&s;o of <HI>Pre&s;cot
Rectory,</HI> both as to the old Rents, and an E&s;ti|mate of the thirteen
&s;everal Tithes demi&s;ed thereunto: Where it appears that the Sum total of
the Value was then, in <HI>January</HI> 1586, near 500 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI>
The next Piece is entitled, <HI>The Manner of the Execution of the Queen
of</HI> Scotts, <HI>the</HI> 8 <HI>of</HI> Feb. <HI>in the Pre&s;ence of &s;uch
who&s;e Names are underwritten.</HI> This takes up two Sides, and leads us in
the next Leaf to the <HI>Accounts of Sir</HI> Richard Shirburne, of Moneys
receiv'd and paid by Warrant from the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> to <HI>Henry
Stanley</HI> of <HI>Cros&s;hall</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Mu&s;ter-Ma&s;ter, for
buying Arms for the train'd Soldiers in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and repairing of
Beacons there. The next is entitled, <HI>Fees al|lowed yearly to the Earl
of</HI> Derby, as Forre&s;ter of <HI>Blea&s;|dall,</HI> &amp;c. Another of
<HI>Moneys received by Sir</HI> John Byron, and paid to <HI>Henry Stanley</HI>
and others, as before, by the Earl of <HI>Derby's</HI> Warrant. A Note of
<HI>the Number of Loads of Hay</HI> gotten to <HI>Lathome</HI> this Year, 1589;
which were 228 Loads. The next is <HI>a Letter from the</HI> Engli&s;h
<HI>Amba&s;&s;ador at</HI> Paris <HI>to a Privy Coun&s;ellor,</HI> commending
the good Offices and Qualities of his Nephew there; and informing him that the
King will receive the <HI>Order</HI> on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> next, with as great
Honour and &s;how of Good-will as is po&s;&s;ible. The next Leaf contains
<HI>an approved Medicine for the Stone</HI>; which is, in a Gallon of new Milk,
to steep, Pellitory of the Wall, wild Thyme, Saxifrage, Par&s;ly, each a
handful, with two or three Radi&s;h Roots &s;liced, one Night; then di&s;till
it all over a moderate Fire: So drink, &s;ix Spoonfuls of the Water, with as
many of Rheni&s;h Wine, adding a little Sugar and Nutmeg, lukewarm, fa&s;ting;
and eat no|thing three Hours after: It &s;hould be drank, the fir&s;t Week,
three times together, and every Week after, but twice; for it forceth very much
Urine. If no great Pain is felt in the Kidneys, 'tis better to drink it but
once every eight Days three Mornings together. Next, after a Note of the
<HI>Bedding in the Lodge at</HI> Pilkinton (a Seat of the Lord

1622. Pages 320.</BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Title</HI> of this approved Work, is in a graved
Fronti&s;piece, which contains Emblematical Repre&s;entations (as was u&s;ual
in the&s;e Times) of <HI>Fame</HI> crowning the Pour|trait of
<HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> crowning that of Antiquity;
with the <HI>Sun,</HI> in a Compartment between them, in E|clip&s;e, and this
Motto, <HI>Relucera</HI>; over a Cave, the En|trance of which is cover'd with a
Curtain, upon which the &s;aid <HI>Title</HI> is in&s;cribed; and at the Bottom
a Pro&s;pect of our Author's Seat, named <HI>Lindley.</HI> In another Leaf,
facing that Fronti&s;piece, we have the Author's Effigies in his Lawyer's Gown;
<HI>Aetat.</HI> 47. 1622. his Arms at the Cor|ners; and for an Emblem at
bottom, the <HI>Sun,</HI> with this Motto, <HI>Relumbre:</HI> Both graved by
<HI>Franci&s;co Delaram.</HI></P>
<P>He dedicates the Book to <HI>George Villers,</HI> Marque&s;&s;e
and Earl of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> Lord High Admiral, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He being a
Native of that County, and none having the like Power to defend his Work
again&s;t the Adver&s;aries of Truth. In the Preface he apologizes for applying
him&s;elf to Studies be&s;ide his Profe&s;&s;ion, by intimating that if the Law
ad|mitted <PB N="288" REF="317"> any Partner, the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary would be
this Study of Antiquities: And that his Con&s;titution being weak, it
di&s;abled him from following the Practice which his Calling required; which
obliging him to the Retirement of a Coun|try Life, and depriving him of tho&s;e
Helps the City wou'd have afforded, mu&s;t render his Di&s;cour&s;e le&s;s
equal to the Worthine&s;s of the Subject; yet rather than his Country &s;hould
longer lie ob&s;cur'd in Darkne&s;s, he adventures to re&s;tore her to her
Worth and Dignity, animated by the Ex|amples of the never enough admir'd
Antiquary <HI>W. Camden,</HI> and that indu&s;trious and well de&s;erving
Ma&s;ter <HI>John Speede,</HI> who in his elaborate Hi&s;tory of
<HI>England</HI> has well &s;poken of all the Shires, and by his great Travail
and Expences ad|ded the Maps of each Shire, with the Plot of every City and
great Town therein in&s;erted, never before performed by any: Al&s;o by the
grave and &s;age Lawyer <HI>W. Lambert,</HI> who from the Depth of Antiquity
has re&s;tored the County of <HI>Kent.</HI> Al&s;o the eloquent and noble
Gentleman <HI>Richard Carew</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who very worthily has
&s;urveyed all <HI>Cornwall</HI>; and that excellent Surveyor <HI>John
Norden</HI> Gentleman, who has briefly de&s;cribed the Counties of
<HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Hertford|&s;hire</HI>; and &s;ince has made
certain chorographical Tables of &s;ome We&s;tern Shires, and a fine
Pro&s;pective of the City of <HI>London.</HI> He al&s;o acknowledges the
Encouragments he had from &s;ome of his Friends, as <HI>John Beaumont</HI> of
<HI>Grace|dieu</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and that expert Genealogi&s;t, his
Kin&s;man, Mr. <HI>Augu&s;tine Vincent, Rouge-Croix,</HI> who imparted many
worthy Notes to him from the Tower; and who&s;e Labours in this kind for the
County of <HI>Northampton,</HI> wou'd ere long come to light. Further, that in
this De&s;cription he has run through, in every Town, tho&s;e four Sections
above men|tion'd in the Title-Page. As for the <HI>Topography</HI> of the
County, he rectified &s;ome Years pa&s;t <HI>Chri&s;t. Saxton's</HI> Map
thereof, with an addition of 80 Towns; which was graved at
<HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> by <HI>Jodocus Hondius,</HI> 1602, (and &s;ince imi|tated
by <HI>Speede,</HI> with an Augmentation of the Plot of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI>)
and reduced into a le&s;&s;er Form, is here in&s;erted. Of the more eminent
<HI>Places</HI> he has &s;poken &s;omething throughout; and where any
<HI>natural</HI> Pa&s;&s;age offer'd, he has not thought it impertinent to
&s;atisfy the Reader a little in this kind; al&s;o adorn'd it with &s;ome
hi&s;torical Digre&s;&s;ions, which have dependance upon the Work; has
ob&s;erv'd, as near as he cou'd, when Mona&s;teries, Churches, noble Seats, and
other <HI>memorable Buildings</HI> were founded; al&s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;hed 
<PB N="289" REF="318"> the <HI>De&s;cent</HI> of <HI>Titles</HI> to
<HI>Lands,</HI> whether by Heirs or Grants; that the Antiquity of Continuance
in a Name might be di&s;cover'd, and the antient Owner known; not intend|ing to
derogate from any Man's Right, or move Doubts or Que&s;tions thereunto. But in
&s;etting down of <HI>Tenures</HI> he has been very &s;paring: The
<HI>Soccage</HI> Tenure he has expre&s;s'd; but no Certainty of any other,
unwilling to give any Cau&s;e of Offence, as knowing there are more Differences
and &s;trange Proceedings in the&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es than in any one Thing of
&s;o common a Nature; tho' they might be rec|tified if the true&s;t and mo&s;t
probable Records and Evidences were accepted. As for the <HI>Law Ca&s;es</HI>
which have latterly happen'd in the Shire, he has briefly remember'd them.
Touching the <HI>Genealogies</HI> and <HI>Arms</HI> of the Gentry he only
&s;peaks of the Ancient, who&s;e Families are extinct, le&s;t not contenting
the Living, he &s;hould be que&s;tion'd without Cau&s;e; yet has in this
re&s;pect remember'd &s;ome few of his Friends. In Church-Matters he has
follow'd an old Ma|nu&s;cript, compil'd <HI>Anno.</HI> 1220,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a Tran&s;cript of it above 300 Years old in the
<HI>Cotton Library.</HI></NOTE> wherein is di&s;cover'd what Churches were
Rectories, what, Appropriate: If Rec|tories, who was Patron, who Incumbent;
what Chapels belong'd to them, and how to be &s;erved: If Appropriate, to what
Mona&s;tery, or religious Hou&s;e belonging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Has further added
from the Records in the Office of the Auditors of the Impre&s;t, their Value in
the King's Books; and &s;hewn, who are the pre&s;ent Patrons of every Church.
The <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities and others he has briefly touch'd as far as came
to his Knowledge. And la&s;tly, has added all the <HI>Arms</HI> in all the
<HI>Church-Windows</HI> in the Shire; and the <HI>In&s;criptions</HI> of the
<HI>Tombs</HI>; which he took by his own View and Travel; for that they may
correct many Errors in Armory or Genealogy, and end many Differences in Law;
the Evidence of a Church-Window having been ac|cepted by a Jury at an
A&s;&s;izes. Has al&s;o added the Names to mo&s;t of the Coats; not following
herein the conceited Blazonry of <HI>Gerard Leigh,</HI> or others of later
Times; but u&s;ed &s;uch Terms as him&s;elf was be&s;t acquainted with, and
might be&s;t &s;erve for any one's under&s;tanding. Thus we have the whole
Scope of his Intention, or a general View of the Topicks, not only treated of
in this Book, but to be treated of in Books of the like nature.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="319">After the Preface, whereof we have here
given the Sub|&s;tance, we have <HI>Saxton</HI>'s Map, therein &s;poken of,

to about 33 Miles, and in breadth, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, at the broade&s;t

Names of ancient Buildings, as Ca&s;|tles, Abbeys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Market-Towns, Rivers, Parks, Forre&s;ts, Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Government; and hence we are led to a particular Di&s;cription of the County,

ob|&s;erves, that thro' the Liberty granted to <HI>Leland</HI> of u&s;ing what

<HI>Janus</HI> which was here; it being well known that <HI>Janus</HI> was
neither adored nor thought of by any but the <HI>Romans,</HI> and this King
<HI>Leir</HI> died at lea&s;t 300 Years before <HI>Rome</HI> was built; which,

But in the hot zealous Times of the Reformation this Trea&s;ure was al&s;o
embezled, till of late, thro' the Bounty of Sir <HI>T. Bodley</HI> and his

<P>Thus we end our brief Recapitulation of this Book; not without
&s;ome wonder to ob&s;erve, that after near &s;ix&s;core Years &s;ince this
Author thus broke through tho&s;e Clouds of Darkne&s;s and Oblivion, wherewith
the Lu&s;tre of this County had been over&s;hadowed, &s;o few others &s;hould
&s;ee the way to imitate his Example, by their further Illu&s;tra|tions
thereof: In&s;omuch that we know not of any one County in <HI>England,</HI>
which in that compa&s;s of Years has had fewer Publications be&s;towed upon it
relating either to its <HI>Antiquities,</HI> or <HI>natural Hi&s;tory.</HI> Nay
even our Author's own improved Copy of this Work, very much enriched with
<HI>Roman, Saxon,</HI> and other Antiquities, has, to this day, been deny'd the
Light. Wherefore we thought it a Debt due to his Merit, as well as to the
Subject he has celebrated, to take the Notice we have here done of them, in
order to excite tho&s;e whom it may concern, to oblige the Publick either with
that enlarged Work of this Author, with further Continuations thereof, or any
other &s;uch Memorials of the Place and its Products, as may render them, with
what Ju&s;tice they de&s;erve, no le&s;s con&s;i|derable than other Counties,

338, be&s;ides Table, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></BIBL></HEAD>
<P>THIS approved Book is well known to be the Work of <HI>Richard
Ver&s;tegan,</HI> a &s;ecular Prie&s;t, who has printed his Name at the End of
his Dedication thereof to King <HI>James</HI>; for this is at lea&s;t the third
Edition, publi&s;hed here at <HI>London</HI> &s;oon after the Author's Death;
the fir&s;t, which he printed him&s;elf at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> being in the Year
1605. The Author was skilful in Drawing and Limning; and has em|belli&s;h'd his
Work with &s;everal Draughts, which are neatly graved, and have not a little
advantaged the Sale of the <PB N="300" REF="329"> Work; in&s;omuch that there
have &s;ince been two Editions more of it in <HI>Octavo,</HI> but the
Impre&s;&s;ion of the Cuts are therein worn faint, and not &s;o valuable as
tho&s;e in the fir&s;t Quarto Editions.</P>
<P>The Author, in his Epi&s;tle to the noble and renowned
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, among other Motives for his Undertaking, intimates,
his finding our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Writers to &s;tand &s;o much upon the
De&s;cent of the <HI>Britains</HI> to be one; as if it con|cern'd the Original
and Honour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; whereby and through the want of
due Di&s;tinction between the two Nations (an Over&s;ight which the
<HI>Britains</HI> in their Account of us will never commit) our true Original
and honourable Antiquity lie involv'd and ob&s;cur'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus
<HI>John Boden</HI> wou'd make us believe, it is in <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s
Com|mentaries to be found, That the <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> of his Time had but
one Woman to &s;erve for ten or twelve Men: Whereas <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> never
heard the Name of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> who came not into <HI>Britain</HI>
near 500 Years after his Death. And thus, not to let &s;lip the Opportunity of
a La&s;h at Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> he is cen&s;ur'd for beginning his <HI>Acts</HI>
and <HI>Monuments,</HI> with &s;aying that <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> was the Son
of <HI>Helen</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woman: Thus another entitles his
Dictionary, which is in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h, The&s;aurus Linguae
Romanae et Britannicae</HI>; which wou'd have been proper enough had it been
written in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Wel&s;h.</HI> Having reflected on the
Confu&s;ion which &s;uch Indi&s;tinctions create, he &s;hews that
<HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> cannot but from the <HI>Saxons</HI> derive their
De&s;cent and Off|&s;pring, and can lack no Honour in de&s;cending from &s;uch
an honourable Race, as this Work will &s;pecify; which our Au|thor was induced
to publi&s;h for his love to this noble Nation, mo&s;t dear to him, becau&s;e
it was his Birth-place, tho' his Grandfather (who was driven into
<HI>England</HI> by Wars and lo&s;s of Friends) was born in <HI>Geldres.</HI>
Towards the Conclu&s;ion of this Epi&s;tle he informs us that if in his
Etymologies he dif|fers from &s;ome <HI>Germans,</HI> 'tis where he has found
them mi&s;taken by having look'd little further than the Language u&s;ed among
them&s;elves, even like tho&s;e who have al&s;o written in the
<HI>Netherlands;</HI> whereas the under&s;tanding of the <HI>Teutonic</HI>
u&s;ed by our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ance&s;tors, as al&s;o that of the ancient
<HI>Franks,</HI> is mo&s;t requi&s;ite; and thereunto the <HI>High, Low,</HI>
and <HI>Ea&s;terland Teutonic,</HI> with re&s;pect al&s;o to the dependant
<HI>Dani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Swedi&s;h,</HI> be&s;ides our modern vul|gar
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI>:

<P>After &s;everal Copies of <HI>Latin</HI> Ver&s;es by <HI>Richard

&s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;es by <HI>Tho. Shelton, Fr. Tregian, A.
Greneway, Ralph Badclyfe,</HI> and the Author him&s;elf, we enter upon the
Work, which is divided into <HI>Ten</HI> Chapters. The Fir&s;t is, <HI>Of the
Original of Nations, and con&s;equently that from which</HI> Engli&s;hmen
<HI>are de&s;cended.</HI> In this Chapter the Author di&s;|cour&s;es, (after
&s;hewing that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are of <HI>German</HI> De|&s;cent,
heretofore called <HI>Saxons,</HI> and &s;till in the <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> as
al&s;o the ancient <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Tongue, &s;o called) of the Original of
Nations from the Divi&s;ion, after the Deluge, at the Tower of <HI>Babel</HI>;
and upon the numerous Increa&s;e of Po&s;teri|ty, illu&s;trated in the Example
of the I&s;&s;ue of one Per&s;on near our Author's Time, and that was a Woman
named <HI>Yoland Baillie,</HI> who died at <HI>Paris</HI> 1514, aged 88 Years,
and in the eighth Year of her Widowhood; by who&s;e Epitaph in the Church-yard
of St. <HI>Innocents,</HI> it appears there were 295 Children i&s;&s;ued from
her&s;elf while &s;he lived. Then we have an Account how the People after the
Flood inhabited the Mountains; how <HI>Nimrod</HI> took upon him the fir&s;t
Go|vernment. Particulars of the Tower of <HI>Babel,</HI> as to its width and
height, from <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> and <HI>I&s;idore.</HI> Of the Con|fu&s;ion of
Tongues; whence the Original of Nations; whence the <HI>Hebrews</HI> were &s;o
called. The Po&s;terity of <HI>Sem, Cham</HI> and <HI>Japhet.</HI> That the
People were not mixed by the Confu&s;ion of Tongues. Concerning the Inhabitants
of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> we are referr'd to <HI>Augu&s;tine Carate</HI>'s
Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Parts. How the <HI>Dutch</HI> are de&s;cended from
<HI>Tui&s;co.</HI> Whence &s;ome Days of the Week are derived. That the
<HI>Germans</HI> were the fir&s;t and only Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of their Country.
Touching their Name of <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Almans</HI>; with their divers
other Names. A Remark upon <HI>Leland</HI>'s a&s;&s;erting that the
<HI>Cimbri</HI> and <HI>Sicambri</HI> received their Names of <HI>Cambria</HI>
the Daughter of <HI>Belinus</HI> King of <HI>Britain.</HI> Expla|nations of the
Names of the <HI>Frei&s;landers, Swevians, Goths, Danes, Normans, Vandals,
Longobards,</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> who were &s;o called from the crooked
Weapons they wore like a Scithe, &s;till called in the <HI>Netherlands</HI> a
<HI>Sai&s;en.</HI> The watch Word <HI>Nem eowr Seaxes.</HI> Examples of other
People re|ceiving their Denomination from their Weapons, as the
<HI>Scythians</HI> from Shooting, the <HI>Galligla&s;&s;es</HI> from their
<HI>Pole|axes,</HI> <PB N="302" REF="331"> as others anciently from the Clothes
and Gowns they wore. And the&s;e are the chief Contents of this Chapter.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Chapter &s;hews <HI>how the ancient noble</HI>
Saxons, <HI>the true Ance&s;tors of</HI> Engli&s;hmen, <HI>were originally a
People of</HI> Germany. And here he a&s;&s;erts, That all our Writers agree the
<HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> came from <HI>Germany.</HI> That all had their Begin|ning
in <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> That the Affinity between the <HI>German</HI> and
<HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> Language, affirmed by &s;ome, extended not to half a
&s;core Words, as our Author was inform'd from the be&s;t Interpre|ters in the
Train of Sir <HI>Ant. Sherley</HI> and <HI>Cuchin Ollibeag,</HI>
Amba&s;&s;adors from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in <HI>Italy, Anno</HI> 1601. That the
<HI>Gauls</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> were by the <HI>Grecians</HI> called
<HI>Celtae,</HI> from their frequent Riding. A Specimen of the
<HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongue, into which the Beginning of the fir&s;t Chapter of
<HI>Gene&s;is</HI> is here tran&s;lated. A fabulous Narration of <HI>Occa
Scarlen&s;is,</HI> concerning <HI>Fri&s;o, Saxo,</HI> and <HI>Bruno,</HI> with
a Confutation thereof. That <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> took its Name of
<HI>Bruno</HI> Son of <HI>Ludolph</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> who fir&s;t
began to build it in the Year 861. This is followed with Arguments to prove
that our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ance&s;tors were originally of <HI>Germany,</HI> and
did not come from other Parts thither; with the Concur|rence of
<HI>Lip&s;ius.</HI> Ob&s;ervations that no Nations call one ano|ther, as each
calls him&s;elf; and that the <HI>Germans</HI> who were the continu'd
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of <HI>Germany,</HI> were never &s;ubdued; al&s;o unmixed
both in People and Language. That the <HI>French</HI> i&s;&s;ued from the
<HI>Franks</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI>; to whom the ancient <HI>Gauls</HI> gave
place, much about the Time that the <HI>Saxons</HI> came thence into
<HI>Britain.</HI> That the <HI>Longobards</HI> or People of <HI>Lombardy,</HI>
and al&s;o the <HI>Normans</HI> i&s;&s;ued from the <HI>Germans</HI>; as the
Nobility of <HI>Spain</HI> from the <HI>Goths.</HI> Then we have many ancient
Te&s;timonies of the Worthine&s;s of the <HI>Germans;</HI> with a De&s;cription
of the Country, as it was antiently; al&s;o the Vertues and Manners of the
Peo|ple: Arguments and Examples to prove, That it is not the Climate or
Temperature of the <HI>Air</HI> makes the Peo|ple of any Country more or le&s;s
learned or ingenious. A Recital of &s;undry rare <HI>Inventions,</HI> in Arts
and Sciences, which had their Original in <HI>Germany.</HI> Reflections upon
their national Vice of Drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>The third Chapter de&s;cribes <HI>the antient Manner of living
among our</HI> Saxon <HI>Ance&s;tors: The Idols they adored while they were
Pagans; and how they grew to be of greate&s;t Name and Habitation of any other
People in</HI> Germany. Here our <PB N="303" REF="332"> &s;aid Ance&s;tors are
very particularly de&s;cribed, as to their per&s;onal Appearance in Attire,
Arms, Exerci&s;e, the Orders or Degrees of People among them, their Cu&s;tom of
<HI>Gavel-kind, Give all kind,</HI> or give each Child his Share; the
nur|&s;ing of Children by their own Mothers; their counting of Time by the
Nights, as Se'nnights and Fortnights, and the Ages of their own Lives by
Winters. Their Computa|tation of Time they notched upon &s;quare Sticks, called
<HI>Al|mon-aght,</HI> or <HI>All moon heed,</HI> whence our <HI>Almanac.</HI>
Here we have the old <HI>Saxon</HI> Names of the twelve <HI>Months</HI> in the
Year, with their Explanations; which we now call by Names of <HI>French</HI>
and <HI>Latin</HI> Derivation. Next of the an|cient Government of
<HI>Saxony</HI>; the four &s;orts of <HI>Ordeal,</HI> or Trial of Right, by
Combat, hot Iron, hot Water, and cold Water: But, not thought fit to be
continued among Chri|&s;tians, they were aboli&s;h'd by Pope <HI>Stephen.</HI>
Here we enter upon the Idolatry of the Pagan <HI>Saxons,</HI> and their
&s;uper&s;titious Cu&s;toms for pre&s;aging of Events. More particularly of
their Idols for the &s;even <HI>Days</HI> in the <HI>Week,</HI> which we have
here neatly repre&s;ented in Sculpture; as fir&s;t, the Idol of the
<HI>Sun,</HI> whence comes the Name of <HI>Sunday</HI>; next that of the
<HI>Moon,</HI> whence <HI>Monday</HI>; next the Idol of <HI>Thy&s;co,</HI>
whence <HI>Tue&s;day</HI>; next is their Idol <HI>Woden</HI> or God of Battle,
whence <HI>Wedne&s;|day</HI>; the next is their Maje&s;tic <HI>Thor,</HI>
&s;itting under a Throne with a Circle of Stars behind his Head, whence
<HI>Thur&s;day</HI>; the next is <HI>Friga,</HI> an Idol that repre&s;ented
both <HI>Sexes,</HI> with a Sword in one Hand and Bow in the other; was reputed
the Giver of Peace and Plenty, the Cau&s;er of Love and Friend&s;hip, and from
the Day of her Adoration we yet retain the Name of <HI>Friday.</HI> The la&s;t
is the Idol of <HI>Seater,</HI> repre|&s;ented &s;tanding on the &s;harp-finn'd
back of a Pearch, to &s;ig|nify, the <HI>Saxons,</HI> for &s;erying him,
&s;hould pa&s;s without Harm in dangerous Places; al&s;o holding a Wheel in his
left Hand, to betoken their Unity and Concurrence in one Cour&s;e; and a Pail
full of Water, Flowers and Fruits in the right Hand, to denote that with kindly
Rain he wou'd nouri&s;h and di&s;po&s;e the Earth to &s;uch Productions. After
the&s;e, we have an Ac|count of two other <HI>Saxon</HI> Idols, as that named
<HI>Ermen&s;ewl,</HI> or the Pillar of the Poor, which the <HI>Franks,</HI>
with other <HI>Germans,</HI> as well as the <HI>Saxons</HI> ador'd: And that
al&s;o named <HI>Flynt,</HI> from the Stone it &s;tood on; be&s;ides three or
four more, which are only named. And here we have our Author's Rea&s;ons why
the <HI>Romans</HI> mi&s;took the <HI>German</HI> Idols to be derived from
their own, as <HI>Thor</HI> from <HI>Jupiter, Friga</HI> from <HI>Venus,</HI>
and <PB N="304" REF="333"> <HI>Seater</HI> from <HI>Saturn:</HI> Al&s;o his
Remarks on the horrible Exce&s;s of Idolatry their Votaries were arrived to, in
that <HI>Harold</HI> I. King of <HI>Norway</HI> &s;acrificed two of his Sons to
his Idols, that they might grant &s;uch a Tempe&s;t as would di&s;|per&s;e and
confound the Fleet which <HI>Harold</HI> VI. King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was
preparing to &s;end again&s;t him. Further, that in <HI>Britain</HI> none of
their Idols were in greater Reque&s;t than <HI>Woden,</HI> as by &s;everal
Places in <HI>Kent, Stafford&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Wilt|&s;hire</HI> may appear,
which retain their Appellations from him. But the&s;e Idols were all
demoli&s;h'd by <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> the fir&s;t Chri|&s;tian <HI>Engli&s;h
Saxon</HI> King, and others of tho&s;e Kings in their &s;everal Territories.
Next we are inform'd how the <HI>Saxons</HI> extended their Bounds in
<HI>Germany</HI> beyond any other People there; and how they were tran&s;ported
by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great into <HI>Tran&s;ilvania</HI> and other Regions;
which introduces an incredible Story of a <HI>Tran&s;portation</HI> which
happen'd in <HI>Saxony</HI> not many Ages pa&s;t. For there came into the Town
of <HI>Hamel</HI> in <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> a Man, whom, partly from his patch'd
or motly-colour'd Coat, they called the <HI>Pied-piper,</HI> who having agreed
with them to rid their Town of Rats, wherewith it was much annoyed; he with his
Pipe drew all the &s;aid Vermin after him into the River <HI>Wea&s;er,</HI>
where they were drown'd. But the Town&s;men then &s;werving from their
Agreement, the di&s;contented <HI>Piper</HI> gave them another Tune thro' the
Town again, but it was a revengeful one, drawing all the Children therein, to
the Number of 130, after him, till they came to a Hill, which opening on the
&s;ide, let them in, <HI>Piper</HI> and all, &s;o clo&s;ed up again, and they
were never more &s;een or heard of, to the great Lamentation of the Parents in
that Town. In memory whereof, it was or|dain'd, that no mu&s;ical In&s;trument
&s;hould be &s;ounded in the Street which led to the Gate, through which they
pa&s;s'd; that no O&s;tery &s;hould be there held; and that in the dating of
all publick Writings, the Year from the going forth of their Children, &s;hould
be added to that of our Lord: Which they have accordingly ever &s;ince
continued, &s;ays our Author. And this great Wonder happen'd the 22d of
<HI>July,</HI> 1376.</P>
<P>Chapter the fourth, <HI>Of the I&s;le of</HI> Albion,
<HI>afterwards called</HI> Britain, <HI>and now</HI> England, Scotland,
<HI>and</HI> Wales: <HI>And how it &s;hewed to be Continent or firm Land
with</HI> Gallia <HI>or</HI> France, <HI>&s;ince</HI> Noah'<HI>s Flood.</HI>
Here having &s;hewn the dif|ferent Opinions of the Derivation of the Word
<HI>Albion</HI> from the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> and from the Name
of &s;ome chief Governor, he proceeds to di&s;play the like variety of
Con|jectures <PB N="305" REF="334"> touching the Name of <HI>Britain,</HI> from
Sir <HI>T. Eliot, Humphrey Lhuyd,</HI> and <HI>Becanus,</HI> not withholding
his own Opinion that the I&s;land had the Name of <HI>Britain</HI> from
<HI>Brute</HI>; however many fabulous Circum&s;tances may have been by a few
ob&s;cure Authors heretofore added to this Hi&s;tory, and &s;o have made the
whole to be doubted of. Next he &s;ets forth the imagin'd De&s;cents from the
<HI>Trojans</HI>; the Cau&s;e of which fond Conceits po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;o
many, he attributes to the want of Learning in former Ages, their
<HI>Druids</HI> them|&s;elves not having any Knowledge of Letters. Our Author
que&s;tions not only the&s;e De&s;cents from the <HI>Trojans,</HI> but the
Hi&s;tory of <HI>Troy</HI> it&s;elf; &s;hewing that Queen <HI>Dido</HI> never
knew <HI>Aeneas,</HI> who was dead a number of Years before &s;he was born; and
that <HI>Brute</HI> was more probably a <HI>Gauli&s;h</HI> Prince than a
<HI>Trojan.</HI> So proceeds to &s;hew how this I&s;land was anciently firm
Land with <HI>Gallia</HI>; naming &s;everal Authors of the &s;ame Opinion,
among whom are Sir <HI>Tho. More, John Twine,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Richard
White;</HI> al&s;o producing many Ar|guments and Examples to maintain &s;uch a
Conjunction, and that there was an <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> which join'd our I&s;land
at <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>Calais,</HI> about &s;ix Miles wide, whereby the
I&s;land was &s;ome time Penin&s;ular. Here we have &s;everal In&s;tances of
the Intru&s;ions and Demolitions which have been made by the Waters; how divers
Steeples in the <HI>Netherlands</HI> do yet appear at Low Water of the Towns
and Villages that have been drowned. And that it is rea&s;onable to think
the&s;e flat and level Countries have been Sea; the great Evenne&s;s thereof
being &s;o made by the Waters wherewith they have been cover'd. This is proved
by the Ob&s;ervations here made of the Shells and Bones of Sea-Fi&s;hes found
two Fa|thoms deep in the&s;e Plains di&s;tant from the Sea; and we have here a
Sculpture of &s;ome which our Author had &s;een. As for the <HI>Fir-Trees</HI>
found al&s;o buried in the&s;e <HI>Netherlands,</HI> with the Roots commonly
lying South-We&s;t; as the Soil is not by nature apt to produce them, our
Author thinks they might be driven hither in the time of the Deluge. Anchors
are al&s;o ob&s;erved to have been found deep in the Earth, and the Skeleton of
a Sea-Elephant in the&s;e Parts; whence it is concluded, that as the&s;e Parts
of <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Brabant</HI> are of Sea become Land, and cannot by
any In|undation become Sea again, it mu&s;t be owing to the break|ing of the
<HI>German</HI> Ocean thro' that <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> which joined
<HI>Albion</HI> to <HI>Gallia.</HI> An Argument that this Separation from the
Continent was &s;ince the Flood, is urged from the great <PB N="306" REF="335">
Plenty of Wolves wherewith this I&s;land was anciently in|fe&s;ted, which no
Man wou'd tran&s;port for the Goodne&s;s of the Breed out of the Continent into
any I&s;land, no more than they will carry Foxes out of our Continent into the
I&s;le of <HI>Wight.</HI> They are therefore pre&s;umed to have pa&s;&s;ed over
of them&s;elves, and grew mo&s;t numerous till by King <HI>Edgar</HI>'s Orders
they were de&s;troy'd throughout the Realm, before who&s;e time two
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Kings, <HI>Madan</HI> and <HI>Mem|pricius</HI> had been
killed by them.</P>
<P>Chapter the Fifth. <HI>Of the Arrival of the</HI> SAXONS <HI>out
of</HI> Germany <HI>into</HI> BRITAIN, <HI>and how they received the
Chri&s;ti|an Faith; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the be&s;t Part of the Country, called
it</HI> England, <HI>and leaving the Name of</HI> Saxons, <HI>came generally to
be called</HI> Engli&s;hmen. Here, after a little Note upon <HI>Brute</HI>'s
Entrance into <HI>Albion,</HI> about 3000 Years after the Creation, and
dividing <HI>Britain</HI> between his three Sons, <HI>Lo|crine,</HI> who had
<HI>England; Albanact,</HI> who had <HI>Scotland</HI>; and <HI>Camber,</HI> who
had <HI>Wales;</HI> we have a &s;hort Remark upon the Original of the
<HI>Scots,</HI> and another on the <HI>Picts,</HI> &s;hewing they were not &s;o
called from painting of their Bodies, but from their being &s;uch notable
Fighters. Next we learn that the <HI>Britains</HI> were &s;ubject to the
<HI>Roman</HI> Government from <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> to <HI>Valentinian</HI>
the Third, that is, almo&s;t 500 Years; till relinqui&s;h'd by them, they
&s;ought Protection in the &s;econd Year of King <HI>Vortiger</HI> again&s;t
the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts</HI> of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who then
<HI>Anno</HI> 447 arrived under <HI>Hingi&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;us</HI> in
three great Ships to the number of 9000, ac|cording to <HI>Pomarius</HI>: And
here we have a Sculpture repre|&s;enting their landing on the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t, with tho&s;e who were the fir&s;t
<HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> in this I&s;land; and particular Accounts we here have of
tho&s;e two Leaders, as to their Birth, Arms, Names, Building and Settlement in
<HI>Kent.</HI> Al&s;o an Ac|count of <HI>Old England</HI> or <HI>Anglia,</HI>
whence they came, which was &s;ituate near <HI>Sle&s;wick,</HI> with the
Signification of <HI>Angle, En|gel,</HI> or <HI>England</HI>; and that it was
fir&s;t cau&s;ed to be &s;o called by King <HI>Egbert:</HI> Al&s;o of the other
<HI>Saxons</HI> called <HI>Vites</HI> and <HI>Juites.</HI> The Signification of
<HI>Wa&s;&s;ail.</HI> The Creation of <HI>Hingi&s;t</HI> King of <HI>Kent.</HI>
The Arrival of a &s;econd Supply of <HI>Saxon</HI> Forces. The Breach between
the <HI>Britains</HI> and <HI>Sax|ons.</HI> The depo&s;ing of
<HI>Vortiger,</HI> enthroning of his Son <HI>Vor|timer.</HI> The Slaughter of
<HI>Hor&s;us</HI>; and Return of <HI>Hingi&s;t</HI> into <HI>Saxony</HI> for
more Forces. <HI>Vortiger</HI>'s Re-a&s;cen&s;ion of the Throne, and Alienation
from the <HI>Saxons.</HI> The bloody Banquet on <HI>May</HI>-Day at
<HI>Salisbury</HI> Plain, in which 300 of <PB N="307" REF="336"> the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nobility, or more, were treacherou&s;ly ma&s;&s;acred by the
<HI>Saxons</HI> under <HI>Hingi&s;t,</HI> at the watch Word <HI>Nem eowr
Seaxes,</HI> or take your Seaxes, which was their Swords or crooked Daggers,
whence they derived their Name. The Donation of <HI>Kent,</HI> &amp;c. to
<HI>Hingi&s;t</HI> confirm'd; and he reigned thirty four Years. After the
mi&s;erable Death of King <HI>Vor|tiger,</HI> we have a Series or &s;hort
Li&s;t of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Kings, and the Years of their Reign to the
Death of <HI>Cadwalladar,</HI> who&s;e Reign ended 685, when began &s;ix
Kingdoms more of the <HI>Saxons</HI> in <HI>Britain</HI>: So that in all, with
that of <HI>Kent</HI> they made an <HI>Heptarchy</HI>; and they are here
di&s;tingui&s;hed. Here al&s;o we have the Names of &s;everal Places in
<HI>Britain</HI> mention'd, which were changed by the <HI>Saxons,</HI>
particularly of <HI>London,</HI> that it was not &s;o called by the
<HI>Britains</HI> from <HI>Luds|town</HI>; Town being no <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI>
but a <HI>Saxon</HI> Word: Be&s;ides then <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> wou'd have
called it after that Name, but it was &s;o called from the famous metropolitan
City of <HI>Lunden</HI> in <HI>Sconia,</HI> &s;ome time of greate&s;t Traffic
in all the Ea&s;t Parts of <HI>Germany</HI>: Nor that <HI>Ludgate</HI> was &s;o
call'd from King <HI>Lud,</HI> be|cau&s;e Gate al&s;o is no <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Word, but was call'd <HI>Leod-geat,</HI> the Gate of the People or popular
Pa&s;&s;age, in re&s;pect of the greater Concour&s;e thro' the &s;ame than any
other in tho&s;e Days. <HI>York</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> call'd
<HI>Euerwyc</HI> and <HI>Eberwyc,</HI> which by vulgar Abbreviation came to be
<HI>boric, uoric,</HI> and &s;o <HI>York: Euer</HI> or <HI>Eber</HI>
&s;ignifying a wild Boar, and <HI>Wye,</HI> a Refuge, or Re|treat; tho&s;e
Bea&s;ts heretofore much infe&s;ting the Fore&s;t of <HI>Gautries</HI> within a
Mile of the Town, in&s;omuch that there re|mains a Toll call'd
<HI>Guid-Law,</HI> which is paid for Cattle at one of the Gates of the City,
which was granted for &s;afe Conduct thro' the &s;aid Fore&s;t. Here follow
&s;ome Examples &s;hewing how Auxiliaries or A&s;&s;i&s;tants to
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Inhabitants make them&s;elves Sharers in their Country; &s;o
returning to <HI>Hingi&s;t,</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;ors; we have a more
particular Account of <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> who was the fourth in De&s;cent from
him, and the fir&s;t of our <HI>Saxon</HI> Monarchs who embraced the
Chri&s;tian Faith; and of certain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pagan Children, who being
a few Years before &s;old at <HI>Rome,</HI> were &s;o admired by
<HI>Gregory</HI> for their Beauty upon his hearing they were called
<HI>Angles,</HI> that he thought them not without rea&s;on &s;o called, for
that, as he &s;aid in allu&s;ion thereto, they had Faces like Angels. This St.
<HI>Gregory</HI> who was him&s;elf coming to <HI>England,</HI> being
af|terwards made Pope, &s;ent St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> hither, who landed in
the I&s;le of <HI>Tanet,</HI> where King <HI>Ethelbert</HI> re&s;orted to him.
And here we have a Repre&s;entation in Sculpture of the <PB N="308" REF="337">
&s;aid King on his Throne under a Tree, with the Manner of St.
<HI>Au&s;tin</HI>'s bringing and preaching the Chri&s;tian Faith, as

<P>The &s;eventh Chapter. <HI>Of the great</HI> Antiquity <HI>of our
an|cient</HI> Engli&s;h Tongue; <HI>and of the Propriety, Worthine&s;s and
Amplitude thereof; with an</HI> Explanation <HI>of &s;undry our mo&s;t
ancient</HI> Engli&s;h Words. Here it is a&s;&s;erted that the Ground of our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> is the <HI>Teutonic Tongue</HI>; and that this Language was
undoubtedly that, which, at the Confu&s;ion of <HI>Babel</HI> the
<HI>Teutonic</HI> People, or tho&s;e conducted by <HI>Tui&s;co</HI> did
&s;peak: One In&s;tance given, is our u&s;ing the Word <HI>babble,</HI> or
<HI>babbling,</HI> from <HI>Babel,</HI> when one &s;peaks confu&s;ed|ly or
vain: Other Inferences from our Language, being at fir&s;t mo&s;tly
Mono&s;yllables. Here we have an Account of <HI>Becanus</HI> his Opinion, That
the <HI>Teutonic</HI> was the Language <HI>Adam</HI> &s;pake in
<HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> with his Rea&s;ons from the Inter|pretation of the Words
<HI>Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Seth, E|noch,</HI> &amp;c. Al&s;o of <HI>God, Devil,
Heaven, Hell, Man, Wo|man,</HI> &amp;c. Here we have the Authorities of
<HI>Toletanus</HI> and <HI>Lip&s;ius</HI> for the va&s;t Extent of this ancient
Language, and a Cen&s;ure upon the Wantonne&s;s of borrowing Words from the
<HI>French</HI> or <HI>Latin</HI> in writing or &s;peaking it. In&s;tances of
this Age being given more to Variety than others. An Example of the Nearne&s;s
of our Language to the <HI>Dutch.</HI> How <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>
came to &s;peak broken <HI>Latin.</HI> Whence the Word <HI>Romance</HI> or
<HI>Romant</HI> is derived. Ex|amples, &s;hewing the <HI>Old French</HI> and
<HI>Old Engli&s;h</HI> were much alike; from <HI>Du Haillan; Otfridus</HI> his
Preface to the Go&s;pels, tran&s;lated about 800 Years pa&s;t; and
<HI>Willeramus</HI> the Ab|bot, his Tran&s;lation, into <HI>Old French,</HI> of
<HI>Canticum Cantico|rum.</HI> Of the <HI>Norman</HI> Mixture with our Tongue;
and that afterwards <HI>Chaucer</HI> was a great Mingler of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
with <HI>French</HI>; wherefore, tho' our Author reverences him as 
<PB N="310" REF="339"> an excellent Poet for his Time, he is not of their
Opinion who call him the fir&s;t Illuminator of the <HI>Engli&s;h Tongue</HI>;
and thinks he might have the greater Affection to the <HI>French</HI> Language,
becau&s;e he was de&s;cended of a <HI>French</HI> or rather <HI>Walloon</HI>
Race. That &s;ince his Time, more <HI>La|tin</HI> and <HI>French</HI> have been
admitted, than left out of our Tongue. From whence it is inferr'd that our
Language is di&s;credited, by borrowing &s;o much, even to the making our
&s;elves unintelligible in our own Country, as that &s;uper|fine Orator did who
declared, That 
<Q REND="inline">"as he itinerated, he obviated a rural Per&s;on,
and interrogating him concern|ing the Tran&s;ition of the Time, and the
Demon&s;tration of the Pa&s;&s;age, found him a meer Simplician:"</Q> Never
dreaming 'twas him&s;elf who made him &s;o; and that if he had ask'd him in
plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> What it was o'clock? And which was his way to the
Place he wanted? he might have had a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer. As &s;uch
Examples are apt to rai&s;e Deri&s;ion even among our &s;elves, much more may
Strangers be inclined to be merry with us at them; &s;ince they have nought
el&s;e for the Loan of their Words; di&s;|daining to borrow of our Store, which
we have rendered &s;o ob&s;olete and uncouth, by de&s;pi&s;ing the U&s;e of it
our &s;elves. As an Example of this Neglect, our Author here gives an Alphabet
of our mo&s;t ancient <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Words with their Ex|planations in
above thirty Pages, and herewith concludes this Part.</P>
<P>The eighth Chapter con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>the Etymologies of the
an|cient</HI> Saxon Proper Names <HI>of Men and Women.</HI> This be|gins with
&s;ome general Rules to di&s;cern the <HI>Saxon Proper Names</HI>; which leads
us to the <HI>Alphabet</HI> of them, contain|ing above thirty Pages; and
concludes with &s;ome Remarks upon the Wi&s;dom of our &s;aid Ance&s;tors in
the Choice and Significancy of them, according to the Cu&s;tom of the
<HI>Hebrews,</HI> who &s;o adapted, or had the like Propriety in their
<HI>Proper Names.</HI></P>
<P>The ninth Chapter &s;hews <HI>how by the</HI> Surnames <HI>of the
Families of</HI> England <HI>it may be di&s;cerned from whence they take their
Originals, whether from the ancient</HI> Engli&s;h-Saxons, <HI>or from the</HI>
Danes <HI>or</HI> Normans. Here, after ob|&s;erving how the <HI>Saxons</HI>
having given Names to Places in <HI>England,</HI> which Places afterwards gave
Names to the Inha|bitants, the Method is preferr'd, becau&s;e our
<HI>Surnames</HI> are infinite, and it wou'd be tedious to &s;pecify a
Multitude of them at length, of chu&s;ing out the mo&s;t u&s;ual Terminations, 
<PB N="311" REF="340"> each to &s;erve for a kind of general Rule, how to
appropri|ate all &s;uch Names as do &s;o end, or more clearly di&s;tingui&s;h
thereby our ancient <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families; beginning with tho&s;e ending
in <HI>all,</HI> proceeding to tho&s;e ending in <HI>beke, berie,</HI> and &s;o
thro' the whole Alphabet. After this we have another Alphabet of our ancient
Surnames which are of one Sylla|ble, and &s;ometimes &s;erving for Terminations
of other Sur|names: Some al&s;o of two Syllables, and not u&s;ed to ter|minate
other Surnames. At the end of this we have a ge|neral Rule for the knowing of
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families, which is if there be a <HI>k</HI> or a <HI>w</HI>
in the Name, neither the <HI>Latin,</HI> nor any of the three Languages
depending thereon, u&s;ing tho&s;e Letters; which &s;ometimes cau&s;es
Confu&s;ion in their writing of our Names: A notorious Example whereof we have
in our renowned Sir <HI>John Hawkwood,</HI> who in the <HI>Latin</HI> Epitaph
upon his Monument at <HI>Florence,</HI> is written <HI>Joannes Acutus</HI>; the
<HI>h</HI> being left out as u&s;ele&s;s, the <HI>k</HI> and <HI>w</HI> as
unu&s;ual; and &s;o, returned into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they have made <HI>John
Sharp</HI> of him. Here follows an Ob&s;ervation upon &s;uch Surnames as have
been &s;uppo&s;ed to take their Original from the <HI>Danes:</HI> And la&s;tly,
the Surnames coming from the <HI>Normans</HI>; the whole Chapter ending with a
Remark upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> or <HI>Welch</HI> Names which are thought to
have been mixed with tho&s;e of the <HI>Romans,</HI> the <HI>Britains</HI>
being under Subjection to the&s;e People about 500 Years. And hence concludes,
the honourable Family of <HI>Cecils,</HI> being i&s;|&s;ued from
<HI>Wales,</HI> is originally de&s;cended from the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>The tenth and la&s;t Chapter treats <HI>Of our ancient</HI>
Engli&s;h Titles <HI>of</HI> Honour, Dignities, <HI>and</HI> Offices; <HI>and
what they &s;ignify: Al&s;o the Signification of our</HI> Engli&s;h Names
<HI>of</HI> Di&s;|grace <HI>or</HI> Contempt; beginning, in the fir&s;t Part,
with the Name of King, and ending with <HI>Yeoman</HI> and <HI>Groom:</HI> And
in the &s;econd Part, beginning with <HI>Baud,</HI> and ending with
<HI>Thief.</HI> And this, with Notice of the <HI>Table</HI> or <HI>Index</HI>

<P>THE accurate Author of this compendious Tract, having recited the
various Opinions which have been advanced about the time of the Foundation of
this Univer&s;ity, which is ju&s;tly reputed one of the mo&s;t famous in the
World, &s;ays, it is chiefly concluded and agreed, that <HI>Alfred</HI> King of
the We&s;t <HI>Saxons,</HI> about the Year 872, was the principal Founder
thereof. And tho' by Wars, both before and &s;ince the Con|que&s;t, its ancient
Glory was much eclip&s;ed, yet &s;o has it been re&s;tored by &s;ucceeding
Princes, and other Benefactors, as to become con&s;picuous among the mo&s;t
famous Acade|mies in <HI>Europe:</HI> And however, the <HI>Ho&s;tels, Halls,
Inns, Schools,</HI> and Religious <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> whereof, &s;ince the
Conque&s;t it did con&s;i&s;t, but now defaced or converted into the pre|&s;ent
Foundations there, were for their Number and that of the Students in them
beyond tho&s;e now extant; yet true and &s;olid Learning has latterly prevailed
there more than ever, and at this pre&s;ent there are eighteen goodly
<HI>Colleges</HI> and <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> maintained with the Lands and Reve|nues
of their Founders, and &s;even <HI>Halls,</HI> where Students live at their own
Charge: Be&s;ides there are publick <HI>Schools,</HI> and a <HI>Library,</HI>
who&s;e Fabric by the Bounty of many royal, noble, and religious Per&s;ons was
of late Years fini&s;hed, which no Univer&s;ity in the World can in all Points
parallel. Here follows their Names, the Times when, and Per&s;ons 
<PB N="313" REF="342"> by whom they were founded, with an Account of their
pre&s;ent State.</P>

<HI>Alfred, Anno Dom.</HI> 872, or in the &s;econd Year of his Reign, and the
Students were maintained out of the King's Exchequer till <HI>William</HI> the
Conqueror took the &s;ame from them. <HI>Willi|am,</HI> Archdeacon of
<HI>Durham</HI> repaired and endowed it anew in 1217, and &s;ince by the Bounty
of Dr. <HI>Walter Skirlaw, Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland, Robert
Dudley</HI> Earl of <HI>Lei|ce&s;ter, Charles Greenwood,</HI> and others, the
Society and Re|venues of this College are much encrea&s;ed, &s;o that there is

named, and divers others, been much enlarged and adorned. The number of Fellows
are at the Di&s;cretion of the Vi&s;itor, Ma&s;ter, and three &s;enior Fellows,

<P>THIS Tract, written by the &s;ame Hand with the former, as appears
by the Manner and Method of it, begins al|&s;o with reciting the various
Opinions about the Foundation of this Univer&s;ity; but &s;ays, the chiefe&s;t
agree, That <HI>Sige|bert</HI> King of the <HI>Ea&s;t Angles</HI> was the
principal Founder thereof, about the Years 630 and 636; who a&s;&s;igned divers
Ho&s;tels and Hou&s;es for the Students, giving them large Privileges and
Charters, whereof &s;ome are yet extant; and procuring al&s;o great Immunities
from Pope <HI>Honorius</HI> I. which <HI>Sergius</HI> I. confirm'd. Since which
time, tho' by Wars, both before and &s;ince the Conque&s;t, it was much
de|faced; yet recovering it&s;elf, it is reputed one of the mo&s;t famous
Univer&s;ities in the World. Much Honour it has received by the many Sons and
Nephews of Kings who have been <HI>Earls</HI> thereof. And tho' the ancient
Ho&s;tels and Hou&s;es were more numerous, yet at pre&s;ent it con&s;i&s;ts of
&s;ixteen goodly Colleges and Halls, erected and maintain'd with the Lands of
their &s;everal Founders; &s;ome whereof no Univer&s;ity can in all Points

A&s;&s;ent of the Companions of the &s;aid Order on the 29th Day of

Interlineations in &s;everal Places, of &s;ome Corrections or Amendments in the

<HI>Renovator</HI> of the no|ble Order of St. <HI>George,</HI> in the 13th year

five Officers, in their proper Robes and En&s;igns of the Order, and all in
their proper Colours. This Part fills eight Pages, but there &s;eems to be a
Leaf wanting at the end, becau&s;e it breaks off abruptly in the Account of the

of Grekelade</HI>; and under that in the &s;ame hand, is al&s;o this
In&s;cription, <HI>Sta|tuta Regis H.</HI> VII^m^i <HI>tempore tran&s;lata
Anglice per</HI> JO. WR. &s;ignifying, that the&s;e Statutes were thus
tran&s;lated in the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. by <HI>John
Wriothe&s;ley</HI> King of Arms. Following this, in the &s;ame Page there is
written, but in a|nother Hand, (which has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>John
Stow's</HI>) <HI>Nece&s;&s;aryes of a &s;trange Prince cho&s;en a Brother and a
Com|panion of the Order of the Garter.</HI> Al&s;o, <HI>The Othe of a Kyng

<P>After a Copy of an old Deed, in another hand, upon the next Leaf,
executed in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. we enter upon a View of the
Arms and Cre&s;ts of the Knights of the Garter, blazon'd all in their proper
Colours. There may be near two hundred, mo&s;t of them fini&s;h'd, in the
compa&s;s of about &s;eventy Pages; and what is a very great Curio&s;ity in a
Work of this nature, we have the Badges to about four&s;core of them, painted
or drawn with a Pen, again&s;t, or at the &s;ides of &s;o many of the &s;aid
Coats. Fur|ther, what &s;till inhances its value to the hi&s;torical
In&s;pector, is, that not only the Names of mo&s;t of the Knights Com|panions 
<PB N="325" REF="354"> are appropriated to the greater part of tho&s;e Arms,
but Characters al&s;o given of upwards of three&s;core of them, containing a
&s;hort Account of their Actions, Marriages, I&s;|&s;ues, Benefactions, Death
and Burial. Which Particulars of &s;uch ancient Record, as this Writing, and
the&s;e Draughts &s;eem to be, mu&s;t be e&s;teemed mo&s;t authentic, as being
&s;o near the original Fountains of Intelligence. In the &s;eventh Page of
the&s;e Draughts we find, again&s;t one of the Coats, this Writing; 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Portugal</HI> 20 ^l^i

<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Maximilian</HI> King of <HI>Romains,</HI>

plainly as old as King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. becau&s;e in the third Page of
the&s;e Draughts, where his Arms and Badges are di&s;play'd, it is thus written
of him, 
<Q REND="inline">"and <HI>nowe gloriou&s;ly reigneth owre Soveryne

this In|&s;cription over the Arms of that King's Son,

Wriothe&s;ley</HI> Garter King of Arms was Author of &s;ome of the&s;e
Cha|racters, and Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> who was Garter afterwards, and died 26

<P>The principal Per&s;onages who&s;e Arms, Badges, and Cha|racters
are thus drawn forth, are fir&s;t, King <HI>Edward</HI> III. who, in his
beginning did many great Acts, here briefly mention'd. After him, King
<HI>Richard</HI> II. who kept a tri|umphant Hou&s;hold, built
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> and made many Dukes and Earls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
After him, King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. which di&s;tre&s;&s;ed King <HI>Richard,

other Foundations. After him, King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. an holy Man; for whom God
&s;hewed many Miracles; for he was more heavenly than worldly: He was fir&s;t
buried at <HI>Chart&s;ey,</HI> and now is removed to the Colege of

After him his Brother King <HI>Richard</HI> III. whiche being evill counceyled,
di&s;enherited his Nephewis, under whome, al&s;o, they dyed; which, byfore he
was King, and did that foule dede, was prey&s;ed for a coragious Knyght,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> The next is King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. of who&s;e Character we
have given a part as above. So we go on to <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of
<HI>Derby,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter, Hugh</HI> Earl of <HI>Stafford,</HI>
and <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Spencer.</HI> Then we have no Characters to four
Coats following till we come to <HI>Humphrey</HI> Duke of
<HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> again&s;t who&s;e Arms and Badges, it is written, that

Coun&s;eil, and with him in all his noble Deeds; whiche ofte was &s;ente in
Amba&s;&s;ade to Ducs, Princes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And thus we end our Survey of
this Part, containing the Arms and Characters of our an|cient Knights of the
Garter down to, about the middle of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. his
Reign.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd Page of the &s;ame Leaf where the former Work
ends, begins another of a different kind, being nothing but Pourtraiture
without any Introduction or verbal Ex|planation, and continues for twenty four
Pages &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. It contains a di&s;tinct Repre&s;entation in &s;o
many painted Draughts of the ancient Ceremonies u&s;ed in creating the
<HI>Knights of the Bath.</HI> The Figures in the&s;e Limnings, tho' they are
not every where in exact Proportion, or finely fini&s;h'd off to the Eye, are
yet &s;o very ob&s;ervable for the punctual Regard that &s;eems to have been
paid to the due Repre&s;entation of all Parts of the Solemnity, all proper
Per|&s;ons that &s;hould appear, all Officers and Attendants, with all the
Di&s;tinction of Habits, Ornaments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that above four&s;core
Years &s;ince the&s;e Draughts were thought worthy of being graved and brought
into Print<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>In <HI>Nich. Upton</HI> de Studio
Milit. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Fol. <HI>Lond.</HI> 1654.</BIBL></NOTE>; wherefore we
&s;hall only ob&s;erve further of them here, that in the &s;aid Sculpture they
are nothing &s;o intelligent as in the&s;e the original Paintings, becau&s;e
the whole Ceremony being con|tracted all into one Sheet Print, and the Colours
all reduced to black and white, we are deprived of &s;everal remarkable 
<PB N="329" REF="358"> Di&s;tinctions in the &s;aid Copy, which in the&s;e
Illuminations might give great Light to &s;ome Parts of our Hi&s;tory and
Antiquities.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Views of this Ceremony we have, two or three Tables
or Genealogies of <HI>Hungary</HI>; of the Kings of <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> and
the <HI>Fitzhardings,</HI> &amp;c. Then we come to &s;ome Pourtraits of certain
noble Per&s;onages two in a Leaf, at full length, painted in their proper
Habits and Robes for twelve Pages together. Among the&s;e are King
<HI>Edward</HI> I. and his Queen; <HI>Richardus de Monthermer</HI> Earl of
<HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Hereford,</HI> with <HI>Joanna</HI> Lady
<HI>Acres</HI> his Wife, Daughter of that King; <HI>Tho. de Monthermer</HI> his
Son, and <HI>Edward</HI> his Son: Al&s;o <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>William
de Montacute,</HI> and <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter of <HI>Thomas de Monthermer;
John</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> his Son, with their
Counte&s;&s;es; <HI>Richard Nevyle</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and his
Lady <HI>Alice; Richard Nevil</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and <HI>Anne</HI>
his Lady; King <HI>Richard</HI> III. and his Queen <HI>Anne; William</HI> Lord
<HI>Ferres</HI> of <HI>Groby,</HI> and Lady <HI>Mar|garet</HI> his Wife; al&s;o
the Duke of <HI>Exeter</HI> and his Dutche&s;s. Of which Pictures the Men,
being mo&s;t of them in Ar|mour; have their Helmets clo&s;ed over their Faces,
all but the two King <HI>Richards,</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Edward</HI>
Sons of <HI>Richard de Monthermer.</HI> After the&s;e we have in four Pages
more, &s;ome unfini&s;hed Draughts of the Standard Bearers; between two of
which are &s;ome of the Knights Companions of the fir&s;t and &s;econd Stall
mention'd.</P>
<P>Then follow a few Leaves of &s;ome Coats of Arms with|out Cre&s;ts
or Badges, and a <HI>Pedigree</HI> of <HI>Dampetre, Earl</HI> of
<HI>Flanders</HI>; with a Draught of two or three monumental Fi|gures: And then
we come to an Account of the <HI>Fees that</HI> William Brugys <HI>alias</HI>
Garter <HI>had of the Prelate and Knights of the Order, be&s;ides the
Sovereign:</HI> Which <HI>Brugys</HI> was in the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> V.
and King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. in his Be|ginning. Al&s;o a Memorandum of about
&s;ixteen <HI>Knights who were created Peers in the Reign of King</HI> Henry
<HI>VI.</HI> and the Days when. The next is a Li&s;t of the <HI>Knights of the
Garter the Third of King</HI> Edward <HI>VI.</HI> in <HI>French</HI>; but
either the Account is not fini&s;hed, or the number of them were then but
Eighteen including the Sovereign. The next Piece is the <HI>Pedigree of the
Lord</HI> Per&s;e <HI>of</HI> Luxemburgh <HI>Earl of Saint Poule.</HI> Towards
the Conclu&s;ion of this Pedigree, we learn that it was made for the Lady
<HI>Margaret Vaux,</HI> and that the Brother of this Lady was named
<HI>William</HI> Lord of the <HI>Vaux,</HI> who was then alive: And further we
have the&s;e <PB N="330" REF="359"> Words, 
<Q REND="inline">"Lo now have ye the Pedigree of the Fader, of the
Moder of my Lady <HI>Margaret</HI> of the <HI>Vaux</HI> now be|yng alyve, Moder

<HI>Britayn,</HI> now all beyng on lyve."</Q> And here ends, as we conjecture,
the ancient Collections in this Book which were made, for the mo&s;t part, by
the <HI>Wriothe&s;leys,</HI> that is, all but a few of the odd Pedigrees, and
perhaps al&s;o one or two of the la&s;t Articles which are here mention'd. For
we ob&s;erve all the Paper (except one Leaf, containing only an Illumination of
&s;ome monumental Ornament, and might be in&s;erted at the la&s;t binding up of
the Volume) from the Be|ginning of the Knights of the Garter's Arms to this
Place, has one Maker's Mark upon it, <HI>viz.</HI> Three <HI>Flower de
Luces</HI> in a <HI>Scutcheon</HI> with a <HI>Coronet</HI> over it.</P>
<P>What follows in this Volume (bound into it by a later Owner) are,
fir&s;t, two Sheets printed in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time, the one from a
Copper-Plate, and is called, <HI>The Uni|on of the Ro&s;es of the Families
of</HI> Lanca&s;ter <HI>and</HI> York: With the <HI>Arms</HI> of tho&s;e who
have been cho&s;en of the mo&s;t Honora|ble <HI>Order</HI> of the
<HI>Garter,</HI> from that Time to this Day, 1589. It was compo&s;ed, that is
the Arms and Dates were &s;ettled by <HI>Thomas Talbot</HI> a noted Antiquary
of tho&s;e Times, and graved by <HI>Jodocus Hondius</HI> of <HI>Flanders</HI>
in <HI>London</HI> the Year above|mention'd. The other Sheet is &s;tuck upon
Canvas, and is &s;o &s;oil'd 'tis &s;carce legible; but it contains a &s;hort
Account in <HI>Latin</HI> of all the Orders of Knighthood Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or
Civil that are famous thro' the Chri&s;tian World. I think it is dedicated to
Dr. <HI>Tho. Hesketh</HI> by <HI>John Clapham.</HI></P>
<P>There are further two <HI>Latin</HI> Tracts in this Volume, which
al&s;o never belonged originally to the afore&s;aid Collections, but are both
bound in with them, (Parchment Covers and all) the one called <HI>Libertates
Collegii.</HI> The other contains the Accounts of <HI>Owen Oglethorp</HI>
Trea&s;urer of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Chapel, from the la&s;t Day of
<HI>October</HI> in the 38th of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to the la&s;t of
<HI>September</HI> in the fir&s;t of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. The re&s;t of the
Book con&s;i&s;ts only of &s;everal Sheets of the printed Titles and painted
Arms of &s;ome Knights of the Garter in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's
time; &s;uch as are u&s;u|ally di&s;per&s;ed at their In&s;tallations, and only
bound in here, at the End, to make it a Volume as portly and magni|ficent 
<PB N="331" REF="360"> to outward Appearance, as it is intrin&s;ically
valuable. The Care of thus gathering and binding together the&s;e Col|lections
is owing to that eminent Antiquary and Herald Mr. <HI>Elias A&s;hmole,</HI>
who&s;e Book it appears to have been by the Impre&s;&s;ion of his Arms which we
&s;ee on the Cover: But the Liberty of thus obliging the Publick with the
Contents of it, we owe to the gracious Favour of a noble Peer, who is mo&s;t
worthily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed thereof; having be&s;ides the Ge|nero&s;ity of this
Communication, al&s;o been at no &s;mall Ex|pence in honouring the Memories of
tho&s;e illu&s;trious Per|&s;onages who&s;e Pourtraitures are before
mention'd.</P>

<Q REND="inline">"no Building to be fully fini&s;hed, which wants a
Cover to bear out a Storm."</Q> Therefore, having made an end of this rude
Pile, pre&s;umes to grace it with the <HI>Lou|ver</HI> of his honourable Name.
Further confe&s;&s;ing his par|ticular Affection and Zeal to him was &s;o much
increa&s;ed from his &s;tedfa&s;t Friend&s;hip in the Days of Proof, that not
only his Hand was ready to &s;ub&s;cribe, but his Heart with|all to acknowledge
the great Merit of his unde&s;erved Fa|vour. <PB N="332" REF="361"> For who may
be more &s;ecurely tru&s;ted in the Port of Liberty, than he that once
vouch&s;afed with a favourable Hand to waft him out of the Surges of uncertain
Chance? And a little further, we ob&s;erve, that from the &s;ixteenth Year of
his Age till this Day, his Cu&s;tom had been, in the Cour&s;e of his Reading to
&s;tore up all &s;uch Rea&s;ons and Ex|amples as occurr'd in Philo&s;ophy, the
Civil Laws, Divinity, or Hi&s;tories, to the Ruin of pretended Prophets and
their Prophe&s;ies. The Readers, of who&s;e Cen&s;ure he is mo&s;t
ap|prehen&s;ive, are of three Sorts: The fir&s;t, looking not into the Subject
but the Writer, with &s;uch Partiality, that <HI>Battus</HI> &s;hall &s;ooner
be crowned with Laurel, if he bear their Li|very, than <HI>Homer</HI> with an
Ivy Garland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The &s;econd Sort, are the clo&s;e &s;ullen
Cen&s;ors, who injure no le&s;s by &s;i|lent Scorn and malicious Innuendos,
than by open Exclama|tions. And the la&s;t kind, are the fal&s;e Prophets and
their Favourites, who neither upon Spleen again&s;t the Writer, nor overweening
of them&s;elves, but only with a mortal Fear le&s;t their <HI>Diana</HI>
&s;hould be robb'd of her &s;ilver Shrine, are like to bend their whole
Endeavour again&s;t the Con|tempt of their inveterate Abu&s;es. This is
followed with &s;ome curious Reflections upon the Vanity of Prophe&s;ies and
Oracles; by the utmo&s;t Preten&s;ions whereof, we cannot alter the determinate
Cour&s;e which is prefixed in the Provi|dence of God, nor progno&s;ticate of
any future Accident. We may change our Ve&s;&s;el, like Sea-&s;ick
Pa&s;&s;engers, but not our Pain; our Bed, but not our Fit; our Climate, but
not our Quality: For he that &s;tinted and confined us to Go|vernment upon the
Ground, forbade us, as it were by Con|&s;equence, <HI>ambulare in
Mirabilibus;</HI> and he that made us ig|norant of many pre&s;ent Matters for
our own Behoof, would not entangle us with Gue&s;&s;es and Conjectures <HI>de
futuris,</HI> for a greater Inconveniency. The Trees which are mo&s;t backward
in putting forth their Blo&s;&s;oms, pro&s;per long; whereas Almonds are mo&s;t
commonly decay'd and &s;tarv'd by the Fro&s;t, for putting out before their
Fellows. Of Time pa&s;t, there is no Comfort; of Joy pre&s;ent, no Stay; of
Chance future, no Certainty. Why then &s;hould not all Sorts of feigned
Prophets look into the Devil's Craft? Who deals like the Eagle with a
Shell-fi&s;h, or a cunning Wre&s;tler with his Mate, in hoi&s;ting us up to the
nice&s;t, and mo&s;t fickle Points, that afterwards the Fall may be more
dangerous, and his Prey ea&s;y; which would never come to pa&s;s, if Men would
look into the Works of God with the Eyes of Hum|blene&s;s, 
<PB N="333" REF="362"> not pry into the Secrets of his Purpo&s;e, with the
Spectacles of Vain-Glory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then, after &s;ubmitting to the
Judgment of his &s;aid Patron, whether this Work &s;hould be de&s;troy'd or
committed to the Pre&s;s, and praying that he might be ble&s;&s;ed with his
heavenly Favour in as ample Mea|&s;ure as him&s;elf had ta&s;ted of his
honourable Friend&s;hip, he concludes this <HI>Dedication</HI>; which is
followed with a &s;hort <HI>E|pi&s;tle</HI> to the <HI>Reader.</HI> Wherein we
perceive he has reformed to advantage his fir&s;t propo&s;ed Method of
di&s;patching all his An&s;wers to the &s;everal Branches of Prophe&s;y
together in one Ma&s;s or Lump, before the winding up of the Di&s;|cour&s;e, by
an&s;wering every Part di&s;tinctly under its proper Head, for good Rea&s;ons
here given. After which he had &s;ome Thoughts of detecting the fal&s;e Virtues
and Properties impo&s;ed upon Herbs and Stones; but con&s;idering how
de|&s;picable the&s;e Abu&s;es were held in the Days of <HI>Sozomen,</HI> and
that &s;uch Fanta&s;ies come never further out of Sea&s;on, than when grave
Matters are debated with Authority, he pur|&s;ued no further this Purpo&s;e: So
clo&s;es his Epi&s;tle with his good Wi&s;hes to his Reader.</P>
<P>The Work it &s;elf is introduced with the Story of
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> loitering with <HI>Circe</HI> the Sorcere&s;s, in his
return from <HI>Troy</HI>; and the Confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Echinis</HI> a reputed
Prophet, how vain all Preten&s;ions are this Way. Here we have a Divi&s;ion of
<HI>Prophe&s;ies,</HI> into divers Kinds, with a Rejection of them, and a
compendious Way offer'd to be &s;atisfied in the Ju|&s;tice of &s;uch Treatment
thereof. Fir&s;t, by pointing out the Cau&s;es which induce Men to embark their
Hope on &s;o faithle&s;s a Bottom as that of Prophe&s;ies. Secondly, by
di&s;proving all the&s;e Kinds thereof, to make it appear what Pains have been
taken to &s;educe the illiterate and unthink|ing Part of Mankind. Thirdly, by
&s;hewing how our ad|hering to &s;uch Vanities is incon&s;i&s;tent with the
Duty of a true Subject or a good Chri&s;tian; from which <HI>Data</HI> or
Prin|ciples is to be known what kind of Prophets may be tole|rated in a State.
Fourthly and la&s;tly, by giving a full An|&s;wer to &s;uch Arguments as have
been u&s;ed in Defence of &s;uch Practices. The fir&s;t Cau&s;e then, is a
De&s;ire in Man to &s;oar above the State he was put in by God. Secondly, a
Di&s;tru&s;t of God; while we think he is not as willing by his Mercy, as able
by his Might to help us. Thirdly, a Credu|lity in being apt to believe things
we wi&s;h may come to pa&s;s: Al&s;o &s;hewing that many Times there needs no
more to the making a Prophet than a natural and ea&s;y Deduc|tion 
<PB N="334" REF="363"> of an Effect from a Cau&s;e; with &s;everal In&s;tances
here|of. Fourth and la&s;tly, an Impatience to know beforehand, the Revolutions
of Government, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here we have &s;ome Reflections on the Burden
of Honour, the Depravity of Ambition, and Vanity of Divination; that it is
unwarranted both by Divinity and Philo&s;ophy: That if Rea&s;on cannot
compa&s;s it, neither will any other Principle in Man; and in what Ca&s;es he
may be provident, but not prophetic: That Melancholy is in&s;ufficient to
qualify Men with this Fa|culty: And that Pa&s;&s;ion is the Parent thereof, as
<HI>Porphiry</HI> maintain'd, is proved erroneous. Hence we pa&s;s to</P>
<P>Chap. II. Of <HI>Dreams. Plato</HI> the chief Patron of them. No
Certainty to be gathered from any Thing he has writ on this Head.
<HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> nearer the Truth; who maintains, That the Limits of our
Knowledge are adequate only to the Strength or Abilities of the Soul, which in
its pre&s;ent State, being always immer&s;ed in Matter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
&s;eems unable, upon the Reception of Images in &s;leep, to judge whether they
are an&s;wer'd by any Thing external or no. If Sleep were a Means to di&s;cover
Things to come, then the &s;ounder and deeper the Sleep, the greater would be
the Di&s;covery; but we find contrariwi&s;e, that Things of Moment are revealed
in &s;lumbers. This Kind of Divination moreover is contin|gent to the Vulgar,
and not to the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t &s;ort of Men; and Dreams are the
Amu&s;ement al&s;o of Infants, and even Brutes as well as human Creatures: The
mo&s;t affecting, often broken, confu&s;ed and effaced out of the Memory.
Af|ter &s;ome Rea&s;ons of the Ancients for rai&s;ing our Regard to Dreams, we
have our Author's for not heeding them. As 1. That &s;ince they are &s;o &s;oon
forgot, the Print they make mu&s;t needs be &s;hallow. 2. That no judicious Man
will chu&s;e Fancy for his Guide; but Dreams are Fancies. 3. If Al|legories
plea&s;e us, <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Robe was of Purple with a Glo&s;s, not
&s;hadowy. 4. The Gods are wont to reveal their My&s;teries to Men &s;ober and
di&s;creet; but we find none dream more than the Fickle and Ungodly. 5. God,
who is Purity it&s;elf, will not make Dreams the Shadows of his ordinary Grace.
6. We may not expect him to give &s;o fair a Colour for Man to depend more upon
the Pride of his Nature which is frail, than upon the Rule of Providence which
is certain. 7. To be exploded, as what would be Cau&s;es of Strife and Debate.
8. And withdraw our Mind from our Duty. 9. As they could not be
di&s;tingui&s;hed, the Certain from the Frivolous. 10. As they could not be 
<PB N="335" REF="364"> valued for Grounds of Truth without detracting from the
&s;acred Maje&s;ty. 11, and la&s;tly, As we are not to mea&s;ure Truth by the
Line of Imagination. Moreover, if any Aim were to be taken or Guide de&s;ign'd
from Dreams, &s;ome Interpreters would be found &s;o expert that we could not
err; but they appear not: And tho' the Events &s;hould an&s;wer &s;ome
Expo&s;itions, who can &s;ay this is not Chance? As for admitting &s;ome Dreams
to have been &s;ugge&s;ted by An|gels, they cannot be admitted for ordinary
Dreams, therefore make not for the Diviner's Trade. And &s;ince neither any
Dreams bring one Effect to divers Per&s;ons, nor to the &s;elf-&s;ame at all
Times, it may be taken for a &s;en&s;ele&s;s Practice to ju&s;tify the Follies
of a number by the Events of &s;ome. And con|cerning God's not revealing
him&s;elf by this Means, as well now, as he may have anciently done, here are
Rea&s;ons given to &s;hew that his Will in this Point is not corre&s;pond|ent
with his Power. Hence we proceed to</P>
<P>Chap. III. Of <HI>Oracles.</HI> And here we have the ridicu|lous
Accounts which the Heathens gave of Divinations thereby, expo&s;ed. With
<HI>Cicero</HI>'s Notion, That the Mind being in&s;pired or blown up by certain
Vapours or Exhala|tions, deliver'd tho&s;e Oracles. And <HI>Cotta</HI>'s
Que&s;tion to the Collectors of <HI>Apollo's</HI> Offering, <HI>viz.</HI> If he
were a God, why did he &s;hrowd him&s;elf in the Bowels of the Earth? That the
I&s;land <HI>Delphos,</HI> where &s;tood the Idol of <HI>Apollo,</HI> was
in&s;pired by Exhalations from the Ground, as main|tained by <HI>Plutarch,</HI>
but di&s;proved by our Author; who a&s;cribes the Prophe&s;ies from &s;uch
Effect, more to the Plough|men than the Prie&s;ts. His Compari&s;on of the
Fable, which &s;uppo&s;es the fir&s;t Prophet to have been found by Chance in
an old Vault in <HI>Hetruria,</HI> to the Tale in <HI>Nubrigen&s;is,</HI>
concerning two young Children brought to <HI>Wolpet</HI> in <HI>Suf|folk</HI>
with an Ea&s;tern Wind. The An&s;wer of <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Proc|tors to the
Que&s;tion of &s;ome Philo&s;ophers, why <HI>Delphos</HI> remaining the &s;ame
in Sub&s;tance, Situation, and Quality as u&s;ual, was notwith&s;tanding
deprived of the Virtue of afford|ing Oracles, if Exhalations were intere&s;ted
in the Cau&s;e: With the Shift of <HI>Demetrius</HI> upon this Objection.
Al&s;o, the Argument of a wild Man for the Silence of this Ora|cle; who &s;aid,
<HI>Apollo</HI> was doing Penance for certain Fami|liarities with
<HI>Daphne,</HI> &amp;c. So could not attend as u&s;ual, to the giving out
Oracles. <HI>Cicero</HI> confe&s;&s;es this Silence; but evades the Debate of
the Cau&s;e. And the Opinions of o|thers <PB N="336" REF="365"> are produced;
but the coming of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is concluded to be the real Occa&s;ion of
&s;uch Silence.</P>
<P>Chap. IV. Of <HI>A&s;trology.</HI> Its Definition. That the
Hou&s;es, Faces, Images, A&s;pects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which it a&s;cribes to
Planets, are neither apparent to Sen&s;e, nor revealed in Philo&s;ophy: That it
is impo&s;&s;ible for one or all the Planets to &s;uppre&s;s the Properties of
Nature; as that a Child which is born under a frowning Planet &s;hould never
laugh. A cold Pro|perty in Planets vainly a&s;&s;erted. The
<HI>Peripatetic</HI> Principle, that no Planet, the Moon excepted, changes
Property, but by regard of Place. The Opinion of others, that all Planets are
favourable in their Kind, but forced to degenerate by Malice in the Bodies on
which they work. That they work according to the Matter which they find,
without giving a &s;econd Nature, or correcting the fir&s;t. The Rea|&s;on why
St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> renounced this Study of the Stars, with the ridiculous
Subdivi&s;ion of the <HI>Zodiac</HI> by the Pre|tenders to this Art. The
Conceits about the <HI>A&s;pects</HI> of the Planets, &s;ufficiently &s;haken
by this Rule in Philo&s;ophy: That the Di&s;po&s;ition of divers Cau&s;es
tending to one certain End, cannot forego their Virtue by meer Di&s;tance, and
nothing el&s;e. Things &s;ublunary only &s;ubject to Pa&s;&s;ions and
Affec|tions; and, therefore, not the &s;upream Bodies or their Beams, as
A&s;trologers imagine. Upon what the Con&s;ideration of <HI>A&s;pects</HI>
depends. The Notion of A&s;pects taken up, in the Author's Opinion, from the
&s;undry Shapes and Figures of the Moon. Next is the Divination from certain
Parts of a Planet confuted, by the Authority of its Inventors. That the
<HI>Chaldees</HI> admitted but eleven Signs: the Forms of which accounted for
by our Author. The ab&s;urd Rea&s;onings of A&s;trologers from the&s;e Signs;
as al&s;o their Inability to ac|count for &s;uppo&s;ed Images in the Front or
Face of every Sign; with their want of Rea&s;on or Authority for culling out
only a certain number of fixed Stars as influential. <HI>Ptolemy</HI>'s
allowing to the Planets ordinary Luck, but to the fixed Stars Happine&s;s,
inconceivable. <HI>Bonatus</HI> his Shift a|gain&s;t the Objection drawn from
the U&s;e of only a certain number of Stars, followed by the Rea&s;on why
Philo&s;ophers defined Chance and Fortune to be Cau&s;es not in them&s;elves,
but by Accident. The Argument, That Events, which draw their Virtue rather from
the Means which happen by the way, than from the fir&s;t Intent; from Fortune
than from Fore&s;ight; &s;eem to be brought to pa&s;s by Chance al|together, in
re&s;pect of us; objected to, by a Compari&s;on <PB N="337" REF="366"> which in
no wi&s;e holds, <HI>viz.</HI> That we may gue&s;s at the Cour&s;e of Things by
poring on the Stars, as well as a Car|penter at the Goodne&s;s of a Frame by
knowing the Timber. Wherefore all Knowledge from remote&s;t Cau&s;es, as from
the Planets, is ob&s;cure. <HI>Plato,</HI> tho' neare&s;t the Truth, when he
&s;ays, That all Planets are benevolent, is yet oppo&s;ed by the Planetarians
to keep up their Scheme. No pre&s;cribing with certainty, where, upon one
Change, &s;o many others follow; as in this Art. The Divi&s;ions of
A&s;trologers in their Fundamentals. Al&s;o a Que&s;tion put to them, Whether,
touching Things which are perfected in Time, we &s;hould gue&s;s according to
the Minute wherein the Work is fir&s;t conceived in our Thought, or when it is
begun, or when it is perfected; or when only part and not the whole is
fini&s;hed. Some Opinions herein; with the Application of the Que&s;tion: As
that, &s;ince the time of Conception is un|certain, we mu&s;t take our Aim by
that of the Birth, as the only Mark we have to guide us. <HI>Haly</HI>'s
Attempt to prove the time of Conception and Birth to be the &s;ame; with the
divers Accidents concurring before we can take the certain Minute of any Birth.
The ab&s;urd Reply of &s;ome hereto. Com|monwealths al&s;o, as pre&s;umed to
have their Fates, the Ob|ject of the&s;e Pretenders. They are que&s;tion'd
again, whe|ther they believe that Influence they talk of, univer|&s;al; from
all the Heavens, or from the Planets only? Shew|ing that it pinches them which
way &s;oever they take it. And after ob&s;erving, that the Angels know nothing
but as God has revealed it to them, concludes, we mu&s;t be Fools in thinking
that any Thing can be di&s;cerned in an <HI>Ephemeris,</HI> which is but the
Device of Man. Here we en|ter upon the Arguments to be drawn from Experience
upon this Subject; and after its Definition we have the Rea&s;ons why it will
make nothing in favour for a&s;trological Divina|tions. That from the Flights
of <HI>Birds</HI> and Bowels of <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> Gue&s;&s;es and Inferences
were &s;ometimes an&s;wered by Events, but not from the Influence of tho&s;e
Things which were &s;up|po&s;ed to be the Cau&s;es. Thus tho' a War &s;hould
follow an <HI>Eclip&s;e,</HI> we may find a more real and rational Cau&s;e.
Next we have an Examination of the dreaded Events of <HI>Comets.</HI> How
divided the Opinions of the Ancients about them. The Objection drawn from
Experience, of <HI>Comets</HI> that have brought forth one Effect, an&s;wered.
That nothing can be predicted from them, becau&s;e of their Incon&s;tancy in
time and place of Appearance, Motion, Figure, Continuance, 
<PB N="338" REF="367"> Qualities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Arguments for their
denoting the Deaths of Princes di&s;proved in every Branch. That they have died
oftner after the glaring of a Rainbow. That many great Princes here named, had
not their Deaths foretold by any Comets. Ob&s;ervations on the Plenty and
Pro&s;perity that rather follow'd them; and Health, exemplify'd in Queen
<HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who never was in better State of Body than during the
twenty five Years of her Reign, in which many Comets appear'd. And here our
Author affirms, as an Eye-Witne&s;s, 
<Q REND="inline">"That when divers &s;crupulou&s;ly di&s;&s;uaded
her Ma|je&s;ty at <HI>Richmond</HI> from looking at the Comet which ap|peared
la&s;t (in 1572) with a Courage an&s;werable to the greatne&s;s of her State,
&s;he cau&s;ed the Window to be &s;et open, and ca&s;t out the&s;e Words,
<HI>Jacta e&s;t alea; The Dice are thrown:</HI> Affirming that <HI>her
&s;tedfa&s;t Hope and Confi|dence was too firmly planted in the Providence of
God, to be bla&s;ted or affrighted with tho&s;e Beams, which either had a
Ground in Nature whereon to ri&s;e, or at lea&s;t no Warrant in Scripture to
portend the Mi&s;haps of Prin|ces.</HI> Behold a Woman, and a Queen, which
&s;eem to be the Kinds and Callings, upon which the Comets, if A|&s;trologers
&s;peak Truth, are wont to prey; and yet &s;he not only relenteth not to common
Fear, but in&s;ulteth rather upon common Folly! Then we have a fine Compliment
paid to her Maje&s;ty for her numerous Virtues, which might make her an
Exception to the common Rule; becau&s;e <HI>Wi&s;dom governs the
Stars.</HI>"</Q> Next we have the Fancies of tho&s;e who a&s;cribe the Cau&s;e
of Earthquakes to Planets, condemned; with an An&s;wer to the Demand why we may
not as lawfully &s;eek out the Properties of Stars as of Stones, Metals,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Shewing, that to &s;earch for that in the Sky which may be
found nearer hand, is repugnant to Philo&s;ophy. And becau&s;e &s;ome
countenance their Preten|&s;ions by <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> 'tis here
di&s;tingui&s;h'd what Parts of Na|ture this Science con&s;iders, and in what
Manner the Rules or Propo&s;itions of any Art &s;hould be lawful, true and
agree|able to Nature, which cannot be found in A&s;trology. Ar|guments taken
from Phy&s;ick, Phy&s;iognomy, and Naviga|tion to prove it an Art of no avail.
Again&s;t the A&s;&s;ertion that it is impo&s;&s;ible to gather any certain
Knowledge of Things which are brought forth by the Concour&s;e of divers
di&s;united Accidents; 'tis affirm'd by the other &s;ide, Poverty, Sickne&s;s,
Death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould rather bear the Name of Ad|herents than of
Accidents, fora&s;much as they claeve to <PB N="339" REF="368"> the Subject,
having a certain Foundation or Ground at the Bottom of our Natures; and the
fal&s;ity of this Affirmation expo&s;ed. Did Planets convey &s;uch Qualities
and Influences as are pretended? then mu&s;t they work the like Effects on
Bea&s;ts. No Credit to the Art, that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> affirms, the&s;e
lower Parts or Earth do confine upon the higher; nor that Per&s;ons inhabiting
under the Meridian are exceeding timo|rous, effeminate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor
la&s;tly, what <HI>Melanchton</HI> affirms, That Children which are born in the
eighth Month never live. The Doctrine of Inundations, Plagues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
proceed|ing from the Contagion of the Air; the Air receiving this Contagion
from the Planets, and the Planets being the Cau&s;es of our Mi&s;ery,
con&s;ider'd and an&s;wer'd, by a parallel Ca&s;e of the Heart in Man.
<HI>Haly</HI>'s In&s;tance al&s;o of Floods, and parching Heats from Planets,
being &s;ome cold, others hot, excepted to. With the Author's Advice to
well-di&s;po&s;ed Wits, to direct their Enquiries only to Things that may be
known.</P>
<P>Chap. V. <HI>Of Conference with Familiars or damned Spirits.</HI>
Herein is &s;et down, the belief of &s;ome, That there neither is certain Hell,
nor &s;hall be Spirits till the latter Day: How|ever, the Exi&s;tence of
Spirits argu'd for. To di&s;pute about the Manner or Mean, where the
Me&s;&s;enger is wicked, or the Me&s;&s;age fal&s;e, wou'd be needle&s;s. The
Means where|by Spirits may be thought to gue&s;s at Things future, pro|po&s;ed
in &s;everal In&s;tances. That the Illu&s;ions of <HI>Sedechias</HI> the
deceitful <HI>Jew,</HI> pre&s;ented before <HI>Lewis</HI> the Emperor; and of
others, ought not to &s;eem &s;trange, &s;ince the Works of God are far more
deep: And &s;ince <HI>Scotto</HI> the <HI>Italian</HI> Jug|ger could play
&s;uch Slights before Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> that tho&s;e who undertook to
di&s;cry them were no le&s;s beguiled than the re&s;t, who pre&s;umed le&s;s
upon their own Penetra|tion, 'tis thought we may deem Familiars to be more fine
and nimble. Further, of the&s;e incorporeal Me&s;&s;engers, as the
<HI>Demon</HI> of <HI>Socrates,</HI> the Spirit that daily called upon
<HI>A|laricus,</HI> and that named <HI>Orthon,</HI> which brought Intelligence
from all Corners of the World to <HI>Ga&s;ton</HI> Earl of <HI>Foix,</HI> as
<HI>Froi&s;&s;art</HI> has at large (and perhaps too largely) related. Some
Arguments in defence of Familiars, and wicked Spi|rits, con&s;ider'd, and
refuted: But the Abettors of this Art being at a Nonplus for want of Rea&s;ons
to defend the &s;ame, appeal to the pretended Apparition of <HI>Samuel</HI>;
and tell us that as the Sorcere&s;s called him up, &s;o &s;urely may the
Con|jurers of the&s;e Times invoke the Souls of godly Men. But 
<PB N="340" REF="369"> our Author denies that it was the real <HI>Samuel.</HI>
If it be urg|ed, Why are Conjurers &s;ometimes &s;o de&s;irous of a dead Hand,
as <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> was accu&s;ed to have cut off that of
<HI>Ar&s;enius</HI> to abu&s;e with magical Practices; or that a Hair, a Pin,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> is de&s;ired by wicked Spirits and Witches, of the Parties
they would have Power over? 'Tis an&s;wer'd, the Gift is naked and impotent,
unle&s;s ve&s;ted with Con&s;ent: The Hand no more able to &s;way the Soul,
than the Fore|ca&s;tle of a Ship to guide the Stern; that the Belief is rather
craved than the Benevolence; the Heart than the Hand; the Tru&s;t than the
Token. That the Souls of Men indeed &s;leep not after death, but Bodies do; and
&s;hall not be awak|ed before the Knell which rings all in to Condemnation or
Paradi&s;e: Wherefore he concludes, That neither Souls nor Bodies can appear to
Conjurers but by a Figure or Sha|dow of Illu&s;ion, &s;o far as it may take a
&s;eeming Colour by the Practice of our Enemy; and &s;hews how unlikely it is
in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Samuel,</HI> That either God &s;hould &s;uffer a Pro|phet
of his own chu&s;ing to turn Deceiver, as <HI>Samuel</HI> cer|tainly had been,
had he deliver'd him&s;elf to <HI>Saul</HI> in &s;uch Terms as the Spirit did,
or that the Devil by his nice&s;t Art could re&s;tore a Body to its former
Shape, which was long before this di&s;&s;olved to Du&s;t and A&s;hes.</P>
<P>Chap. VI. <HI>Of the Cabali&s;tick Art.</HI> Its Antiquity,
Mean|ing, and why &s;o called. The two Species thereof defined. From the&s;e
Definitions hardly conceivable, how this Art can afford either Help or Credit
to the Prophet. Here we have an Account of the Conference held by our noble
Au|thor, &s;ix Years before, with one <HI>Brocado</HI> a <HI>Jew,</HI> then in
the Court, who was a Pretender to this whim&s;ical Art of expounding the
Scriptures; and from thence took upon him to divine what Fortune &s;hould
betide the <HI>Low Coun|tries,</HI> as he &s;aid he had foretold what &s;hould
befall <HI>Paris,</HI> at lea&s;t five Years before the Ma&s;&s;acre fell out.
But our Author, among other Arguments, told him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That Ex|amples which fell out by Chance, were
never current where the Cau&s;e was to be ju&s;tified by Rea&s;on: And
therefore, till he could as readily product a certain Ground to make his
Gue&s;&s;es good, as &s;core up a Regi&s;ter of blind Events, I mu&s;t (&s;ays
he) rather prai&s;e his Luck than his Learning; for as well might he
progno&s;ticate that the <HI>Cock-pit</HI> in <HI>Shoe-lane</HI> &s;hould
&s;ink on the third of <HI>June,</HI> becau&s;e a Theatre fell down about that
time at <HI>Rome</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Claudius</HI>; as that either
<HI>Antwerp</HI> or <HI>Paris</HI> <PB N="341" REF="370"> &s;hould be plagued
by the Pattern of <HI>Edom</HI> or <HI>Samaria.</HI> We may be generally taught
by the Precedents of God's righteous Judgments upon former States, that
who&s;oever &s;ins or tran&s;gre&s;&s;es again&s;t either Table of the Moral
Law, &s;hould either be corrected by his Ju&s;tice, or for|borne by his Mercy;
but by whether of the&s;e Means God purpo&s;eth to cure the Carbuncle of Man's
Iniquity is concealed from our Knowledge, and therefore were it vain to gue&s;s
what his Plea&s;ure is to execute. The &s;afe&s;t Cour&s;e is to &s;u&s;pect
the wor&s;t, becau&s;e Extremities are due; but yet we cannot determine and
re&s;olve of nei|ther."</Q></P>
<P>Chap. VII. <HI>Of the Scripture Authorities for
Progno&s;tication.</HI> Shewing how, in &s;everal In&s;tances, it is there
prohibited. The fal&s;ity of the A&s;&s;ertion made by the Pretenders to
the&s;e Arts, That they never make Enquiries into any thing unlawful. The
<HI>High German</HI>'s Proof of the Certainty of Star-Divinity, in the Warning
given to Frier <HI>Savanorola,</HI> by <HI>Bellantius</HI> the A&s;trologer,
expo&s;ed; evidencing how vain and ineffectual &s;uch Warnings are; &s;ince
what is de|creed by De&s;tiny, cannot be prevented by Intelligence. Then the
Enquiry is made, Whether the Warning that this Frier &s;hould be put out of the
way for Here&s;y were true or not? If he affirm it to be true, then mu&s;t he
grant that Doctrine to be Here&s;y which him&s;elf and his Country main|tain
again&s;t <HI>Rome: That the Pope's Pardons are of no Ef|fect. That he abu&s;es
his Authority,</HI> &amp;c. For the&s;e were the Matters in defence whereof
<HI>Savanorola</HI> died: If he deny the&s;e Articles to de&s;erve the Name or
Note of Here&s;y, which either he mu&s;t do or confe&s;s him&s;elf a Heretick;
then it is evident that <HI>Bellantius</HI> was very much beguiled in
be|lieving or adverti&s;ing that <HI>Savanorola</HI> &s;hould be &s;wept away
for ungodly Doctrine. The Ca&s;e is pa&s;&s;ing hard, which drives a Man either
to renounce his Faith, or to for&s;ake his Fancy. Were there a Regi&s;ter among
the Stars, we need|ed not to &s;eek the Scripture for our Order, but the
Planets for our Fortune. In the Moderns, to &s;ay, they regard the Stars, as
Means only, by which God brings his Decrees to pa&s;s, and &s;o ought not to be
&s;et upon a Level with the An|cients, who look'd upon them as Gods; will not
&s;erve, and wherefore. Ob&s;ervations on the two next Centuries after
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> being rife&s;t with Miracles, as the Air is warme&s;t at the
&s;etting of the Sun, and the People apter to believe the Gifts and Doctrine of
Miracles, the fre&s;her their Sufferings <PB N="342" REF="371"> were who
propagated them. The Antiquity of <HI>A&s;trology</HI> examined, with its
Derivation. The Singularity of <HI>Porphiry;</HI> who alone of all the
Philo&s;ophers gave into it. And the vain A&s;&s;ertion of <HI>Melanchton,</HI>
That <HI>Mo&s;es, E&s;&s;ay, &amp;c.</HI> impugn not all kind of Divination,
but rather the Pride of Man, in pre&s;uming to under&s;tand tho&s;e Secrets
which are re&s;erved to God alone, as the <HI>La&s;t-Day,</HI> &amp;c. The
Objections drawn from Scripture, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> being learned in the
My&s;teries of <HI>Egypt;</HI> and from the&s;e Words, <HI>Mine Hour is not yet
come,</HI> &amp;c. and from the Star which conducted the wi&s;e Men at the
Birth of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; con&s;ider'd, and an&s;wer'd. <HI>Cardan</HI>'s
Er|ror in a&s;&s;igning the Hour of that Birth; with the fooli&s;h rea&s;oning
of him, and others, from the Face of the Heavens at that time. The Knowledge of
<HI>Seth, Abraham, &amp;c.</HI> urged in vain, &s;ince their Remarks of the
heavenly Orbs tended to the Knowledge of their Cour&s;es, Eclip&s;es, &amp;c.
for the Di&s;tinction of Times and Sea&s;ons, &s;o needful in the Ob&s;ervance
of their religious Fea&s;ts and Ceremonies: Wherefore &s;ome have gather'd from
certain Expre&s;&s;ions in Scripture, That the Tribe of <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI>
was bound by Order, to the Study of the Stars; as divers Colleges in
<HI>Cambridge</HI> are enjoin'd by the Statutes of the Founders, to give
Allow|ance to certain Per&s;ons for this End.</P>
<P>The Remainder of the Volume is a Collection of Argu|ments,
Authorities, and Hi&s;tories further detecting the De|lu&s;ions of the&s;e
pretended Prophets, and their Ambition in all times, of &s;upplanting what is
certain in God's Providence by what is probable in Man's Conjecture. Their
Subtilty herein further laid open. Their little Arts, Shifts, and
E|quivocations to gain them&s;elves Profit and Honour, where they happen to be
lucky in their Predictions; and &s;helter or &s;ubterfuge, where they an&s;wer
not what they had rai&s;ed the Apprehen&s;ions of Mankind to expect; with
abundance of Examples to prove how ju&s;tly &s;uch pre&s;umptuous Impo&s;|tures
de&s;erve the Dete&s;tation of all &s;ober and ingenuous Men; as conducing to
the Mi&s;carriage of &s;o many Under|takings, which have depended on their
Authority. Al&s;o pointing out the various Means of di&s;cerning &s;uch
Counter|feits; which by how much more &s;ucce&s;sfully they have de|luded the
Generality in all Ages pa&s;t, &s;hould &s;o much more effectually arm the
Future with Precaution. Among the&s;e Examples in this concluding Part, we
cannot be here fur|ther particular than to mention tho&s;e of
<HI>Manfredus</HI> the A|&s;trologer, who promi&s;ed an <HI>Italian</HI> Prince
many Years Life, <PB N="343" REF="372"> and that he him&s;elf &s;hould live to
di&s;cover many Wonders by his Art, but died in the approaching Spring before
he could declare them. The Experiment of the Earl of <HI>Arun|del,</HI> who
would note in his Almanacks, the Changes of the Weather, every where contrary
to what had been a&s;&s;erted by the Writers of them; and found his own
Predictions oftner true than theirs. The Per&s;ages of Dearth in 1558 confuted,
by its proving a plentiful Year. The Di&s;appoint|ment of the <HI>Abbot</HI>
who built him a Hou&s;e on <HI>Harrow-Hill,</HI> to &s;ecure him from the
threatned Deluge, when it proved a Year of great Drought. The Delu&s;ions, by
Figures and Images, in the old painted Manu&s;cripts, and in the Herald's
Books, and tho&s;e pretended to be pre&s;erved in religious Hou&s;es; as
<HI>Merlin</HI>'s Prophecies, which were chain'd to the Desks in many
Libraries. The U&s;e made of Women in the&s;e prophetick Cozenages: Thus
<HI>Montanus</HI> wrought by <HI>Maximilla,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> by their
<HI>Pucelle de Dieu,</HI> and our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Anabapti&s;ts by their
<HI>Holy Maid of</HI> Kent. The vain Pre&s;umption of <HI>Verdungus</HI> a
Prophet in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. In&s;tances of the Ruin of
&s;everal Princes by adhering to the Advice of Magicians, A&s;trologers, and
Pro|phets. Other late In&s;tances of &s;ome learned <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men
deluded thereby: How <HI>Bellantius,</HI> who predicted <HI>Savano|rola</HI>'s
Execution, could not fore&s;ee his own. When Car|dinal <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI>
&s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly avoided <HI>King&s;ton</HI> upon <HI>Thames,</HI> tho'
his ready Way from <HI>A&s;her</HI> to the Court, for a quibbling Prophecy,
that <HI>King&s;ton &s;hould be his End:</HI> Was it not a ly|ing Prophecy? For
even Sir <HI>Anthony King&s;ton,</HI> to who&s;e Cu&s;tody the Cardinal was
committed, proved not his End, nor brought him to the Tower, as he was charged;
for he died of his Illne&s;s at <HI>Leice&s;ter.</HI> And the Rood of
<HI>Darvill Gathren,</HI> how did it burn a <HI>Forre&s;t,</HI> according to
the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Prophecy that it &s;hould? When in &s;corn to
&s;uper&s;tition, the Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> burnt a Fryer with that Image. But
we might quote half the Book to mention the Examples of this kind, wherewith it
is all over &s;o elaborately embelli&s;h'd; which would have been much ea&s;ier
commanded, had it been furni&s;hed with a <HI>Table</HI> or <HI>Index,</HI>
whereof the &s;econd Edition in Fol. 1620. is al&s;o deficient; but we hope it
will be &s;upply'd therewith, if ever this Work arrives at a Third.</P>

Al&s;o with another Sculpture of the Author, in a laced Cap, with his Hand on a

that he was fifty five Years of Age at this time that the &s;aid Work was

<P>The Work is in&s;cribed by the Author to King <HI>Charles</HI>;
and in his Preface or Epi&s;tle to the Reader we find he had not only
ob&s;erved what Honour Foreign Nations had re|ceived by thus putting into print
their monumental Antiqui|ties, but that he had with painful Expences travell'd
over mo&s;t Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ome Part of <HI>Scotland</HI> to
collect the Funeral In&s;criptions of all the Cathedral and Parochial Churches:
But being much di&s;couraged to proceed by the many malignant and avaricious
Defacements he beheld of tho&s;e venerable Remains, and the many Ob&s;tructions
and Troubles he met with from petulent Officers and Church|wardens for want of
a Commi&s;&s;ion, he had Thoughts of burying all in &s;ilence, till he was

<Q REND="inline">"This Bi&s;hoprick, &s;ays our Author, is &s;o
over|&s;hadowed by the nearne&s;s and greatne&s;s of the See of
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> that it looks but like a good Benefice for one of his
Grace's Chaplains; yet for Antiquity and Dignity of a long Succe&s;&s;ion of
Reverend Lord Bi&s;hops, it may equally compare with its Neighbour of
<HI>Canterbury.</HI>"</Q> For they had both one Founder, <HI>Ethelbert</HI>
King of <HI>Kent</HI>; who built this Church to the Honour of St.
<HI>Andrew,</HI> and endowed it; whereof <HI>Ju&s;tus</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> was
con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop by St. <HI>Augu&s;tine.</HI> Here follows a &s;hort
De&s;cription <PB N="351" REF="380"> of the City; the Limits of the
Dioce&s;&s;e, and the four Dea|neries it con&s;i&s;ts of: The Valuation in the

<HI>Oxford</HI>; who&s;e Monument here was re|newed by Sir <HI>Henry
Savile</HI> Warden of that College; and by the In&s;cription thereon, it
appears the &s;aid Bi&s;hop died 1277. After three Bi&s;hops more, here
mention'd, our Au|thor ob&s;erves, That he finds no more of this Dioce&s;&s;e
to have been buried in this Cathedral Church; becau&s;e com|monly they were
removed to another See, before they were tran&s;lated to another Life, this
Preferment being only a Step to a higher: Therefore after a Word or two of St.
<HI>William</HI> the Baker and Martyr, here in&s;hrined from

Churches, the re&s;t of the Funeral Monuments in this, being of later Times;
which he re&s;erves for another Vo|lume. At <HI>Ailesford,</HI> we have an

<P>AT the Beginning of this Edition (for the Book was fir&s;t
publi&s;hed in Twelves, 1650, without any Figures or Prints, but one in the
Front, of divers di&s;torted or di&s;|gui&s;ed <PB N="365" REF="394"> Heads and
Faces) there is prefix'd a comely Sculp|ture of the Author Dr. <HI>John
Bulwer,</HI> engraved by <HI>W. Faithorne</HI>; and likewi&s;e another Title of
the Book, not much differing from the true Title above, but &s;eemingly added
by the Printer to advance the univer&s;al reading of the Author, being
entitled, <HI>A View of the People of the whole World,</HI> &amp;c. Next we
have a Device in <HI>Sculpture,</HI> repre&s;enting the awful <HI>Tribunal</HI>
of <HI>Nature,</HI> by Commi&s;&s;ion from <HI>Heaven,</HI> trying the
<HI>artificial Changeling,</HI> or Mi&s;creants of all <HI>Nations,</HI> for
the abu&s;e of their Bodies; with a &s;hort Explanation. Then follows a
Specimen of the Author's Poetry, in an <HI>Anacephalaeo&s;is</HI> or
Recapitulation of his Work, intimated by the Fronti&s;piece; wherein he briefly
recounts the many Scoffs and Rapes made on the natural Form of the Human Body.
After this we have the Au|thor's Dedication to his Friend <HI>Thomas
Dicon&s;on;</HI> and likewi&s;e &s;everal epi&s;tolary Poems, &s;ome in
<HI>Latin,</HI> and o|thers in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to the Author in honour of
his Perform|ance; one of the&s;e is written by <HI>Francis Gold&s;mith,</HI>
ano|by <HI>Adolet Hogere&s;a</HI> of <HI>High Cro&s;s.</HI> There is al&s;o a
Letter to the Author from <HI>R. Ma&s;on</HI> of the <HI>Middle Temple,</HI>
di&s;|covering the Ground of all Man's Prevarications. Next follows a &s;hort
Hint of the U&s;e of this Treati&s;e; al&s;o an anonymous Piece of
<HI>Latin</HI> Poetry, called <HI>Diploma Apollinis,</HI> being a <HI>Bull</HI>
or <HI>Writ</HI> of <HI>Apollo</HI> for tran&s;lating the Author to the
<HI>Cele&s;tial</HI> Orb. After, a Li&s;t of near 300 Authors, Hi&s;tori|ans,
Phy&s;icians, Anatomi&s;ts, Travellers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> referr'd to in this
Work, we come to the <HI>Introduction</HI>; which highly extols the native
Beauty and Excellency of the human Fabrick; &s;hews the Impiety of varying from
Nature; and the de|praved Figures introduced thereby; 
<Q REND="inline">"in&s;omuch," &s;ays the Author, "that it may
&s;eem the fir&s;t Men only were made by God, but the re&s;t were of Mens
Invention: And," continues he, "while we di&s;pute in Schools, whether if it
were po&s;&s;ible, it were lawful for Man to de&s;troy any one Species of God's
Creatures, tho' but of <HI>Toads</HI> and <HI>Spiders</HI>; Becau&s;e this were
a taking away one Link of God's Chain, one Note of his Harmony; we have taken
away the Jewel at that Chain."</Q> He then recommends my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s
Opinion of the Helps towards Beauty, and good Features, and reducing the
Blemi&s;hes of Per&s;ons to their natural State: And &s;o introduces his
Work.</P>
<P>The Work it&s;elf is repre&s;ented in 24 Scenes, and is all along
illu&s;trated with wooden Prints, of the Forms and <PB N="366" REF="395">

Philo&s;ophy of the hu|mane Fabrick, as well as his Wit and Humour in
cen&s;uring the depray'd and pragmatical Inventions of Men. We will therefore
take a View of his APPENDIX, <HI>exhibiting the</HI> PEDIGREE <HI>of the</HI>
ENGLISH GALLANT, which he thought proper to annex, (having fir&s;t pro&s;ecuted
his principal De&s;ign) to an&s;wer the Expectation of the Publick, who thought
him nece&s;&s;arily engag'd to touch upon the Defor|mity of Apparel, of which
almo&s;t every Scene afforded emergent Occa&s;ion; herein explaining the
Proverb, <HI>God makes, but the Taylor &s;hapes.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the more civiliz'd Nations, had
hitherto in a great mea&s;ure e&s;caped his Sentences of <HI>Trea&s;on</HI>
again&s;t <HI>Nature,</HI> whereof many others were convicted; yet here they
mu&s;t bear to have their affected Vanities laid before them; 
<Q REND="inline">"It were not impo&s;&s;ible," &s;ays he, "to
prove, that there was never any Conceit &s;o extravagant, that ever forced the
Rules of Nature; or Fa&s;hion &s;o mad, which fell into the Imaginations of any
of the&s;e indicted Nations, that may not meet with &s;ome publick Fa&s;hion of
Apparel a|mong us, and &s;eem to be grounded upon the &s;ame pre|tended
Rea&s;on."</Q> Our Sugar-Loaf Hats, he attributes to the &s;ame Conceit as the
Sugar-Loaf Heads of Foreign Na|tions; our &s;quare Caps are owing to their
&s;quare Heads; our flat Caps to their flat Heads; our <HI>French</HI> Hoods
imitate the <HI>Unicorn-like Dre&s;s</HI> of Hair among the barbarous
<HI>In|dians:</HI> He then &s;hews the foreign Extraction of our Masks,

&s;la&s;hing and pincking our Doublets, our Cod-Piece Fa&s;hion, and
Trunk-Ho&s;e have all their Semblances in <HI>Barbarian</HI> Nations; as
likewi&s;e our indecent Fa&s;hion of naked Brea&s;ts and Shoulders, our vain

Shoes, our broad Shoes (which in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Time occa&s;ion'd a
Procla|mation that no Man &s;hould wear his Shoes above &s;ix Inch|ches
&s;quare at the Toes) and our high Shoes have all their Original from abroad.
The Vanity of di&s;gui&s;ing our Shapes is al&s;o farther expo&s;ed by &s;ome
poetical Quotations from <HI>Alex. Barclay</HI>'s Tran&s;lation of the <HI>Ship
of Fools</HI>; and from an ingenious old Comedy in the Character of
<HI>Lupa.</HI> He then concludes the Appendix with this apt Recom|mendation, 
<Q REND="inline">"That whoever will reduce Cloaths and Gar|ments to
their true End, mu&s;t fit them to the Service and Commodity of the Body,
whence dependeth their Original Grace, and Comeline&s;s, which can no way
better be done than by cutting them according to the natural Shape and
Proportion of the Body; as we may probably imagine the Skin-Garments were,
wherewith the Lord <HI>God,</HI> who be&s;t knew their Shape, fir&s;t cloath|ed
the Nakedne&s;s of our <HI>fir&s;t Parents.</HI>"</Q> And he &s;hews that we

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THUS has the <HI>Briti&s;h Librarian</HI> given a Specimen of his
Undertaking, to the Extent of one Volume, in a diligent Ab&s;tract of above
fifty of our Scarce, U&s;eful, and Valuable Books. In the choice of them, tho'
here are &s;ome of con&s;iderable Valuation extracted; yet the high Price to
which many are advanced in the Shops, has been no Temptation for his making
that the Rule to prefer them. He has rather thought tho&s;e which are mo&s;t
<HI>u&s;eful,</HI> the mo&s;t <HI>valuable</HI>; and &s;uch of them, as are
grown mo&s;t <HI>&s;carce,</HI> mo&s;t needful and de&s;erving of this
Recommenda|tion. Accordingly, 'tis not doubted but they will appear worthy of
it, by what is here advanced to the Reader's No|tice from them; being all
fraught with much <HI>ob&s;ervable Matter,</HI> as may be ea&s;ily perceived by
this Scheme, for compa&s;&s;ing the readie&s;t Knowledge and Command thereof,
which may have e&s;caped the Notice or Memory of &s;everal, who are even
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Books them&s;elves which contain it; and al&s;o give
Intelligence to others, of many remarkable <HI>Things, Places,</HI> and
<HI>Per&s;ons</HI> which they would never otherwi&s;e have known; no Work, of
the like &s;ize a|mong us, having pointed out &s;uch a variety of tho&s;e
Parti|culars, or drawn into &s;o clo&s;e a compa&s;s, the Sub&s;tance of &s;o
much Reading. He might perhaps have been more amu&s;ing to &s;ome Readers, in
being more ample upon &s;ome parts of his Authors; by extracting Pages of
Controver&s;ies, or Paragraphs of the pretty Stories, &s;urprizing
Pa&s;&s;ages, or eloquent Speeches in them; but as many <HI>Topicks</HI> in an
Author mu&s;t be &s;acrificed to gratify a few Indulgences in this kind, and to
divert &s;ome, the Enquiries of abundance remain un&s;ati&s;|fy'd; the Plan has
been follow'd which was at fir&s;t laid down, to make it a Work rather of
general <HI>Information,</HI> than particular <HI>Entertainment.</HI></P>
<P>Among the Books conducive to this Purpo&s;e, tho&s;e for which
Gratitude here demands chiefly the Publication of our Thanks, are the
<HI>Manu&s;cripts.</HI> Such in the fir&s;t place, is that here call'd, Sir
<HI>Thomas Wriothe&s;ly's Collections</HI>; contain|ing <PB N="374" REF="403">
the <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Characters</HI> of the <HI>Knights of the
Garter,</HI> and <HI>Views</HI> of the ancient <HI>Ceremonies</HI> u&s;ed in
<HI>Creating</HI> the <HI>Knights of the Bath,</HI> &amp;c. For that Sketch
which the <HI>Li|brarian</HI> has here given the <HI>Publick</HI> of it, they
are both be|holden to the Permi&s;&s;ion of his Grace the Duke of
<HI>Mon|tagu,</HI> the noble Owner of that valuable Volume;and to &s;ome
Explanations thereof, which were al&s;o courteou&s;ly imparted by <HI>John
An&s;tis</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>Garter,</HI> Principal <HI>King of
Arms,</HI> who&s;e exten&s;ive Knowlege in the&s;e Subjects, his own elaborate
Publications, in honour of both tho&s;e Or|ders, have &s;ufficiently confirm'd.
Nor will it be thought a Repitition unnece&s;&s;ary, by grateful Minds, that
the <HI>Li|brarian</HI> here renews his Acknowledgments to <HI>Nathaniel
Booth</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Gray's-Inn,</HI> for his repeated
Communica|tions; having been favour'd not only with that curious
<HI>Mi&s;|cellany,</HI> containing many of the old Earl of <HI>Derby</HI>'s
Papers, which, in one of the foregoing Numbers is abridg'd; but others out of
his choice Collections, which may enrich &s;ome future Numbers, when
Opportunity &s;hall permit the Con|tents thereof to appear. Other Manu&s;cripts
herein de&s;cribed, were partly the Collection of Mr. <HI>Charles Grimes,</HI>
late, al&s;o of <HI>Gray's-Inn,</HI> and in the Book&s;eller's
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for whom this Work is printed; except one ancient Relique of
the famous <HI>Wicklife,</HI> for the u&s;e of which, many Thanks are here
return'd to Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Ames,</HI> Member of the <HI>Society of
Antiquaries.</HI> The Author of this Work is moreover obliged to the Library of
this la&s;t worthy Pre&s;erver of An|tiquities, as al&s;o to that of his
ingenious Friend Mr. <HI>Peter Thomp&s;on,</HI> for the u&s;e of &s;everal
<HI>printed Books</HI> which are more &s;carce than many Manu&s;cripts;
particularly &s;ome, &s;et forth by our fir&s;t Printer in <HI>England</HI>;
and others, which will ri&s;e, among the Curious, in Value, as, by the
Depre|dations of Accident, or Ignorance, they decrea&s;e in Num|ber. We mu&s;t
take &s;ome further Opportunity to expre&s;s our Obligations to other Gentlemen
who have favour'd us with &s;uch like Litterary Curio&s;ities; and to &s;ome
hundreds unknown, who have &s;hewn a reli&s;h for the U&s;efulne&s;s of this
Performance, by encouraging the Sale of it.</P>
<P>There can be added nothing more for the Reader's fur|ther
Convenience, to this general Table or <HI>Contents,</HI> but an Alphabetical
<HI>Index</HI> to it; as a Ma&s;ter-Key that will give immediate recour&s;e to
tho&s;e Topicks, in &s;o many Volumes thus ab&s;tracted, which had been lock'd
up, or &s;ecreted from their Knowledge to whom they would have been u&s;eful. 
<PB N="375" REF="404"> And as from tho&s;e <HI>ancient Springs</HI> it is
hereby obvious to all Readers, what a <HI>new River</HI> of Intelligence is
conducted for their Benefit; &s;o the Author (from the Example of o|thers in
&s;uch-like Attempts) may be &s;ure of that Satisfac|tion which ari&s;es from
the Contemplation of having been in&s;trumental to &s;o much publick Good.
Tho&s;e who know the nature of &s;uch Works, may think one Volume,
com|prehending the principal Matters in &s;uch a Library of Books, and near one
half of them Folios, expeditiou&s;ly publi&s;h|ed within the Space of one Year:
But as, in <HI>Performan|ces of this kind,</HI> the mo&s;t indu&s;trious Part,
is that which is mo&s;t invi&s;ible, and the Fatigue is accounted of, from the
&s;mall Quantity of Writing which appears, not the va&s;t and un&s;een Ma&s;s
of Reading required therein; the Operation is apt to be thought dilatory, by
tho&s;e who are unacquainted with the Labour of it. And for the &s;ame
Rea&s;on, that they convey the Mind to &s;uch multifarious Advantages of
Infor|mation, their own Merits al&s;o are u&s;ually di&s;regarded by the
Generality, who are unexperienc'd in the Execution, but enjoy the Advantages of
the Work. Like tho&s;e who look down with Admiration, at the Co&s;t and Pains
which are be|&s;towed upon the curious Compartments into which a Piece of
Ground is divided, and the flow'ry Groups, the verdant Mazes, or the fragrant
Bowers wherewith it is adorn'd; yet overlook tho&s;e artificial Mounts and
Terras Walks, which they are at that in&s;tant upon, which give them all that
Com|mand over this Variety of Pro&s;pects, and are indeed, the mo&s;t
expen&s;ive and laborious Ornaments in the Garden.</P>
<P>All we &s;hall &s;ay more of our <HI>Librarian,</HI> is, If he is
pre|vail'd on to proceed, in cultivating this Undertaking with|out
Intermi&s;&s;ion, he will continue his utmo&s;t Pains to make it an&s;wer all
the Accommodations propo&s;ed from it: Or if thro' other Engagements it
&s;hould be &s;uffer'd to lie fallow for a Sea&s;on, 'tis in hopes of
increa&s;ing its Vigour, and making the Returns equivalent to the Toils
thereof.</P>
