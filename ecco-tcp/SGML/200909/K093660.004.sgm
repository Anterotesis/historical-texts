<P>A GOOD man will live with the world as a wi&s;e man lives with his wife; he will not let him&s;elf down to be a dupe to it's hu|mours, a devotee to it's plea&s;ures, or a flatterer of it's faults; he will make him&s;elf as happy as he can in the connection for his own &s;ake, re|form where he is able, and complain only when he cannot help it. I am &s;ick of that conver&s;a|tion which &s;pends it&s;elf in railing at the times we live in; I am apt to think they are not made better by tho&s;e complaints, and I have oftentimes occa&s;ion to know they are made wor&s;e by tho&s;e very people who are loude&s;t to complain of them. If this be really one of the habits of age, it is high time for every man, who grows old, to guard again&s;t it; for there is no occa&s;ion to in|vite
<PB N="2" REF="9">
more peevi&s;h companions for the la&s;t hours of life, than time and decrepitude will bring in their train: Let us look back upon things pa&s;t with what content we can, &s;alute time pre&s;ent with the be&s;t grace we are able, and re&s;ign our|&s;elves to futurity with calmne&s;s and a patient mind: If we do not wi&s;h to be bani&s;hed from &s;ociety before death withdraws us from it, don't let us tru&s;t to the world's re&s;pect only, let us &s;trive al&s;o to conciliate it's love.</P>
<P>But I do not wi&s;h to argue this point with the &s;ect of <HI>the Murmurers</HI> merely upon the ground of good policy; I &s;hould be &s;orry for the world, if I could give no better rea&s;on for keeping well with it than in &s;elf-defence: I really think it a world very ea&s;y to live with upon pa&s;&s;able good terms; I am free to confe&s;s it has mended me &s;ince I have lived with it, and I am fully of opi|nion it has mended it&s;elf: I don't deny but it has it's failings; it &s;till cuts out work for the morali&s;ts, and I am in no fear of finding &s;ubject matter for three more volumes of e&s;&s;ays, before I have exhau&s;ted the duty of an <HI>Ob&s;erver.</HI> How|ever, though I have pre&s;umed upon taking up this character late in life, yet I feel no provoca|tion from what I <HI>ob&s;erve</HI> in others, or in my&s;elf, to turn <HI>Murmurer</HI>; I can call the time pa&s;t un|der my review, as far back as my experience
<PB N="3" REF="10">
will go, and comfort my&s;elf by the compari&s;on of it with the time pre&s;ent; I can turn to the authors, who have delineated the manners of ages antecedent to my own, without being a&s;hamed of my contemporaries, or entertaining a &s;uperior re&s;pect for their's. I cannot look back to any period of our own annals, of which I can con&s;cientiou&s;ly pronounce, according to &s;uch judgment as I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, that the hap|pine&s;s of &s;ociety was better &s;ecured, and more completely provided for than at the pre&s;ent moment.</P>
<P>This may appear &s;o hardy an a&s;&s;ertion, that if the <HI>Murmurers</HI> take the field again&s;t me, I &s;u&s;|pect that I &s;hall find my&s;elf, as I frequently have done, in a very decided minority; for let the reader take notice, I know the world too well to think of getting popularity by defending it; if ever I make that my object, I mu&s;t run counter to my own principles, and abu&s;e many, that all may read me: In the mean time I &s;hall make a &s;hew of &s;ome of my defences, if it be only to convince the <HI>Murmurers,</HI> that I &s;hall not capitu|late upon the fir&s;t &s;ummons; and I will keep &s;ome &s;trong po&s;ts ma&s;ked from their view, that if they repeat their a&s;&s;ault, I may &s;till have re|&s;ources in my reach.</P>
<P>Society is cemented by laws, upheld by reli|gion,
<PB N="4" REF="11">
endeared by manners, and adorned by arts.</P>
<P>Let us now enquire what is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the&s;e great fundamentals of &s;ocial happine&s;s, and whether any better period can be pointed out, compared to which their pre&s;ent &s;tate may be ju&s;tly pronounced a &s;tate of declen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of England has undergone many changes: The monarch, the nobles and the people, have each in their turn for a time de&s;troyed that proper balance, in which it's ex|cellence con&s;i&s;ts. In feudal times the ari&s;tocra|tic power preponderated, and the kingdom was torn to pieces with civil di&s;tractions. From the acce&s;&s;ion of Henry the Seventh to the breaking out of the great rebellion the power of the &s;o|vereign was all but ab&s;olute; the rapacity of that monarch, the brutality of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the per|&s;ecuting &s;pirit of Mary, and the imperious pre|rogative of Elizabeth left &s;carce a &s;hadow of freedom in the people; and, in &s;pite of all the boa&s;ted glories of Elizabeth's golden days, I mu&s;t doubt if any nation can be happy, who&s;e lives and properties were no better &s;ecured than tho&s;e of her &s;ubjects actually were: In all this period the mo&s;t tranquil moments are to be found in the peaceful reign of James the Fir&s;t; yet even then the king's <HI>jus divinum</HI> was at it's
<PB N="5" REF="12">
height, and totally overturned the &s;cale and equi|poi&s;e of the con&s;titution. What followed in Charles's day I need not dwell upon; a revo|lution en&s;ued; monarchy was &s;haken to it's foundations, and in the general fermentation and concu&s;&s;ion of affairs the very dregs of the people were thrown up into power, and all was anar|chy, &s;laughter and oppre&s;&s;ion. From the Re|&s;toration to the Revolution we contemplate a period full of trouble, and, for the mo&s;t part, &s;tained with the deepe&s;t di&s;grace; a pen&s;ioned monarch, an abandoned court, and a licentious people: The abdication, or, more properly, the expul&s;ion of a royal bigot, &s;et the con&s;titution upon it's bottom, but it left the minds of men in a ferment that could not &s;peedily &s;ub&s;ide; antient loyalty and high monarchical principles were not to be &s;ilenced at once by the peremptory fiat of an act of parliament; men &s;till harboured them in their hearts, and popery, three times expelled, was &s;till upon the watch, and &s;ecretly whetting her weapons for a fourth attempt. Was this a period of &s;ocial happine&s;s?&mdash;The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Hanover &s;till left a pretender to the throne; and though the character of the new &s;o|vereign had every requi&s;ite of temper and judg|ment for conciliating his government, yet the old leaven was not exhau&s;ted, fre&s;h revolutions
<PB N="6" REF="13">
were attempted and the nation felt a painful re|petition of it's former &s;orrows.</P>
<P>So far therefore as the happine&s;s of &s;ociety de|pends upon the &s;ecure e&s;tabli&s;hment of the con|&s;titution, the ju&s;t admini&s;tration of the laws, the &s;trict and correct a&s;certainment of the &s;ubjects rights, and tho&s;e &s;acred and inviolable privileges as to per&s;on and property, which every man among&s;t us can now define, and no man living dares to di&s;pute, &s;o far we mu&s;t acknowledge that the times we live in are happier times, than ever fell to the lot of our ance&s;tors, and if we complain of them, it mu&s;t be on account of &s;omething, which has not yet come under our review; we will therefore proceed to the next point, and take the pre&s;ent &s;tate of religion into our con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Religious feuds are &s;o terrible in their con&s;e|quences, and the peace of this kingdom has been &s;o often de&s;troyed by the furiou&s;ne&s;s of zealots and enthu&s;ia&s;ts, &s;truggling for church-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, and per&s;ecuting in their turns the fallen party without mercy, that the tranquillity we now enjoy, (greater as I believe than in any time pa&s;t, but certainly as great) is of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to put the modern <HI>murmurer</HI> to &s;ilence. To &s;ub&s;tantiate my a&s;&s;ertion, let me refer to the ri&s;ing &s;pirit of toleration; wherever that ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit
<PB N="7" REF="14">
prevails, it prevails for the honour of man's na|ture, for the enlargement of his heart, and for the augmentation of his &s;ocial happine&s;s. Whil&s;t we were contending for our own rights, &s;elf-de|fence compelled us to keep off the encroach|ments of others, that were ho&s;tile to tho&s;e rights; but the&s;e being firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, we are no longer warranted to hang the &s;word of the law over the head of religion, and oppre&s;s our &s;e|ceding fellow-&s;ubjects. Is there any ju&s;t rea&s;on to complain of our e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy in their collective character? If they do not &s;tun us with controver&s;ies, it is becau&s;e they under&s;tand the &s;pirit of their religion better than to engage in them: The publications of the pulpit are &s;till numerous, and if they have dropt their high in|flammatory tone, it is to the honour of Chri&s;ti|anity that they have &s;o done, and taken up a milder, meeker language in it's &s;tead. As for the practice of religion, it is not in my pre&s;ent argument to &s;peak of that; my bu&s;ine&s;s is only to appeal to it as an e&s;tabli&s;hment, e&s;&s;ential to the &s;upport and happine&s;s of &s;ociety; and when we reflect how often in times pa&s;t it has been made an engine for &s;ubverting that tranquillity and good order in the &s;tate, which it now peace|ably upholds, I think it will be clear to every candid man that this cannot be one of the cau&s;es
<PB N="8" REF="15">
of complaint and murmur again&s;t the pre&s;ent times.</P>
<P>The <HI>Manners</HI> of the age we live in is the next point I am to review; and if I am to bring this into any decent compa&s;s, I mu&s;t reject many things out of the account, that would make for my argument, and &s;peak very briefly upon all others.</P>
<P>To compare the manners of one age with tho&s;e of another we mu&s;t begin by calling to re|membrance the changes that may have been made in our own time, (if we have lived long enough to be witne&s;&s;es of any) or we mu&s;t take them upon tradition, or gue&s;s at them by the writings of tho&s;e who de&s;cribe them: The comic poets are in general good de&s;cribers of the living manners, and of all dramatic painters in this cla&s;s Ben Jon&s;on is decidedly the be&s;t. In the mirror of the &s;tage we have the reflection of the times through all their changes from the reign of Elizabeth to that of Anne, with an exception to the days of Oliver; of which inter|val if there was no other delineation of the reigning manners, than what we find in the an|nals of Whitelocke and Clarendon, we &s;hould be at no lo&s;s to form our judgment of them. I &s;topt at the age of queen Anne, becau&s;e it was then that Sir Richard Steele and Mr. Addi&s;on
<PB N="9" REF="16">
began to &s;pread their pallets, and when they had compleated <HI>The Spectator,</HI> nobody will di&s;pute their having given a very fini&s;hed pourtrait of the age they lived in. Where they &s;top tradition may begin; &s;o that I think an ob&s;erving man, with all the&s;e aids and no &s;hort experience of his own to help them out, may form a pretty clo&s;e compa|ri&s;on in his own thoughts upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t remind the reader that I am &s;peak|ing of manners as they re&s;pect &s;ociety. Now we can readily refer to certain times pa&s;t, when the manners of men in this country were in&s;ufferably boi&s;terous and unpoli&s;hed; we can point to the period, when they were as notoriou&s;ly re&s;erved, gloomy, dark and fanatical; we know when profligacy threw off all appearances, and liber|tini&s;m went naked as it were into all &s;ocieties; we can tell when pedantry was in general fa&s;hion, when duelling was the rage, and the point of honour was to be defined by a chain of logic that would have puzzled Ari&s;totle; we can turn to the time, when it was reputable to get drunk, and when the fine gentleman of the co|medy entertains his mi&s;tre&s;s with his feats over the bottle, and recommends him&s;elf to her good graces by &s;wearing, blu&s;tering, and beating up the watch: We know there are &s;uch words in the language as fop and beau, and &s;ome can
<PB N="10" REF="17">
remember them in daily u&s;e; many are yet living, who have had their full-bottomed wigs brought home in a chair, and many an old lady now crowds her&s;elf into a corner, who once hooped her&s;elf in a circle hardly le&s;s than Ar|thur's round table: Here I may be told that dre&s;s is not manners; but I mu&s;t contend that the manners of a man in a full-bottomed wig mu&s;t partake &s;omething of the &s;tiffne&s;s of the barber's buckle; nor do I &s;ee how he can walk on foot at his ea&s;e, when his wig goes in a chair. How many of us can call to mind the day, when it was a mark of good-breeding to cram a poor furfeited gue&s;t to the throat, and the mo&s;t &s;ocial hours of life were thrown away in a continual in|terchange of &s;olicitations and apologies? What a &s;troke upon the nerves of a mode&s;t man was it then to make his fir&s;t approaches, and perform his awkward reverences to a &s;olemn circle all ri&s;ing on their legs at the awful moment of his entry! and what was his condition at departing, when, after having performed the &s;ame tremendous ceremonies, he &s;aw his retreat cut off by a double row of guards in livery, to every one of whom he was to pay a toll for free pa&s;&s;age! A man will now find his &s;uperiors more acce&s;&s;ible, his equals more at their ea&s;e, and his inferiors more mannerly than in any time pa&s;t. The effects of public
<PB N="11" REF="18">
education, travel and a general intercour&s;e with mankind, the great influx of foreigners, the va|riety of public amu&s;ements, where all ranks and degrees meet promi&s;cuou&s;ly, the con&s;tant re&s;ort to bathing and water-drinking places in the &s;ummer, and above all the company of the fair &s;ex, who mix &s;o much more in &s;ociety than here|tofore, have with many other con&s;piring cau&s;es altogether produced &s;uch an ea&s;e and &s;uavity of manners throughout the nation, as have totally changed the face of &s;ociety, and levelled all tho&s;e bars and barriers, which made the approaches to what was called good company &s;o trouble&s;ome, and ob&s;tructed the intercour&s;e between man and man. Here then I &s;hall conclude upon this to|pic, and pa&s;s to the Arts, which I &s;aid were the ornaments of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>As I am per&s;uaded my argument will not be conte&s;ted in this quarter, I need &s;pend few words upon &s;o clear a point. If ever this country &s;aw an age of arti&s;ts, it is the pre&s;ent; Italy, Spain, Flanders and France have had their turn, but they are now in no capacity to di&s;pute the palm, and England &s;tands without a rival; her painters, &s;culptors and engravers are now the only &s;chools, properly &s;o called, in Europe; Rome will bear witne&s;s that the Engli&s;h arti&s;ts are as &s;uperior in talents as they are in numbers to tho&s;e of all na|tions
<PB N="12" REF="19">
be&s;ides. I re&s;erve the mention of her ar|chitects as a &s;eparate cla&s;s, that I may for once break in upon my general rule by indulging my|&s;elf in a prediction, (upon which I am willing to &s;take all my credit with the reader) that when the mode&s;t genius of a <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> &s;hall be brought into fuller di&s;play, England will have to boa&s;t of a native architect, which the brighte&s;t age of Greece would glory to acknowledge.</P>

<P>There are &s;ome countries, where no &s;ubject can properly be &s;aid to be independant; but in a con&s;titution &s;o happily tempered as our's, that ble&s;&s;ing &s;eems peculiarly annexed to affluence.

<P>When I con&s;ider the numberle&s;s indulgencies, which are the concomitants of a great fortune, and the facility it affords to the gratification of every generous pa&s;&s;ion, I am mortified to find how few, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e advantages, avail them&s;elves of their &s;ituation to any worthy purpo&s;es: That happy temper, which can pre|&s;erve a medium between di&s;&s;ipation and avarice, is not often to be found, and where I meet one man, who can laudably acquit him&s;elf under the te&s;t of pro&s;perity, I could in&s;tance numbers, who deport them&s;elves with honour under the vi&s;ita|tions

<P>I lately took a journey into a di&s;tant county, upon a vi&s;it to a gentleman of fortune, whom I &s;hall call <HI>Attalus.</HI> I had never &s;een him &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to a very con&s;iderable e&s;tate; and as I have met with few acquaintance in life of more plea&s;ant qualities, or a more &s;ocial temper than Attalus, before this great property unex|pectedly devolved upon him, I flattered my&s;elf that fortune had in this in&s;tance be&s;towed her fa|vours upon one who de&s;erved them; and that I &s;hould find in Attalus's &s;ociety the plea&s;ing gra|tification of &s;eeing all tho&s;e maxims, which I had hitherto revolved in my mind as matter of &s;pecu|lation only, now brought forth into actual prac|tice; for among&s;t all my ob&s;ervations upon human affairs, few have given me greater and more frequent di&s;appointment, than the almo&s;t general abu&s;e of riches.

<P>UPON my arrival at the hou&s;e I was &s;hewn into a &s;mall room in the ba&s;e-&s;tory, which the owner of this fine place u&s;ually oc|cupied and in which he now received me: here I had been but a very few minutes before he propo&s;ed to &s;hew me the hou&s;e, and for that purpo&s;e conducted me up &s;tairs to the grand apartment, and from thence made the entire tour, without excepting any one of the bed|chambers, offices or even clo&s;ets in the hou&s;e: I cannot &s;ay my friend Attalus con&s;ulted <HI>times and &s;ea&s;ons</HI> in chu&s;ing &s;o early a moment after my arrival for parading me about in this man|ner; &s;ome of the apartments were certainly very &s;plendid; a great deal of rich furniture and many fine pictures &s;olicited my notice; but the fatigue of &s;o ill-timed a perambulation di&s;abled me from

expre&s;&s;ing that degree of admiration, which &s;eemed to be expected on this occa&s;ion, and which on any other I &s;hould have been forward to be&s;tow: I was &s;orry for this, becau&s;e I believe he enjoyed little other plea&s;ure in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hou&s;e, be&s;ides this of &s;hewing it; but it happened to my ho&s;t, as it does too frequently to the owners of fine places, that he mi&s;&s;ed the tri|bute of flattery by too great eagerne&s;s in exact|ing it.</P>
<P>It appeared to me that Attalus was no longer the gay lively man he was formerly; there was a gloom upon his countenance and an inquietude in his manner, which &s;eemed to lay him under a con&s;traint that he could not naturally get rid of: Time hung heavy on our hands till the hour of dinner, and it was not without regret I perceived he had arranged his family meals upon the fa|&s;hionable &s;y&s;tem of London hours, and at the di&s;tance of two hundred miles from the capital had by choice adopted tho&s;e very habits, which nothing but the general cu&s;tom of late a&s;&s;em|blies and long &s;ittings in Parliament can excu&s;e upon the plea of nece&s;&s;ity: It was now the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, which made the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of our time more glaring, for whil&s;t the be&s;t hours of the afternoon were devoted to the table, all exerci&s;e and enjoyment out of doors
<PB N="27" REF="34">
were either to be given up, or taken only in the meridian heat of the day. I di&s;covered a further bad con&s;equence of the&s;e habits upon &s;ociety and good-fellow&s;hip, for &s;uch of the neighbouring gen|try, who had not copied his example, were de|terred from making him any vi&s;its, not pre&s;uming to di&s;turb him at un&s;uitable hours, and yet not able, without a total di&s;arrangement of their own comforts, to make their time conform to his. Attalus him&s;elf, I mu&s;t acknowledge, both &s;aw and confe&s;&s;ed the bad &s;y&s;tem he was upon, he found him&s;elf grown unpopular among&s;t his country neighbours on this very &s;core, and was piqued by their neglect of him: <Q REND="inline">"It was a vil|lainous cu&s;tom,"</Q> he ob&s;erved,
<Q REND="inline">"and de&s;tructive both of health and plea&s;ure; but all people of fa&s;hion dined at five, and what could he do? He mu&s;t live as other great families lived; if in|deed he was a mere private gentleman, he might do as he liked be&s;t."</Q>If it be &s;o, thought I, this man's great fortune is an incumbrance to him; if it robs him of health and plea&s;ure, what does it give him, nay what can it give him, in com|pen&s;ation for the lo&s;s of &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings? If fa|&s;hion takes away from Attalus the liberty of do|ing what he be&s;t likes, and is be&s;t for him, I mu&s;t have been mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing indepen|dance was the re&s;ult of affluence; I &s;u&s;pect there
<PB N="28" REF="35">
are not all the advantages in his conditon which I &s;uppo&s;ed there were&mdash;I will examine this more narrowly.</P>
<P>The next morning, after a late breakfa&s;t, the con&s;equence I had fore&s;een en&s;ued, for we were advanced into the hotte&s;t hours of the day, when Attalus, being impatient to &s;hew me the beauties of his park and grounds, gave orders for the equipages and hor&s;es to be made ready, and we were to &s;et out upon the &s;urvey in a burning &s;un. When the train was in waiting at the door, we &s;allied forth, but here a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion began, in which &s;o many things required a new arrangement, that a long &s;top was put to our march, whil&s;t the &s;crutinizing eye of Attalus was employed in a minute examination of every thing appertaining to the cavalry and carriages; the hor&s;es were wrong harne&s;&s;ed, they were to be changed from the off-&s;ide to the near-&s;ide, &s;addles were to be altered, and both groom and coachman were heartily recommended to repeated damnation for their &s;tupidity and inattention&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Never any man was &s;o plagued with ra&s;cally &s;ervants as I am,"</Q>cried Attalus;
<Q REND="inline">"they are the cur&s;e and vexation of my life; I wi&s;h I could live with|out them; no man can be happy, who has to do with them."</Q>&mdash;Is it &s;o? (&s;aid I within my|&s;elf) then I have the advantage over you in that
<PB N="29" REF="36">
re&s;pect, for I have but one man and one hor&s;e, and both are always ready at a moment's warn|ing.</P>
<P>I mounted a phaeton with Attalus and we &s;et forward in a broiling day: My conductor im|mediately began to vent his angry humour upon the wrong object, and plied his thong at &s;uch a furious rate upon his unoffending hor&s;es, that the high-mettled animals &s;o re&s;ented the unju&s;t cor|rection, that after &s;truggling and kicking under the la&s;h for &s;ome time, one of them reared acro&s;s the pole of the chai&s;e and &s;napped it: This pro|duced a &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ion more violent than the fir&s;t, and though it was evident the &s;ervant had put the hor&s;es on their proper &s;ides at fir&s;t, the fault was charged upon him with vehement im|precations, and this produced a &s;econd halt longer and more di&s;agreeable than our &s;etting out had been: Our purpo&s;e however was not to be de|feated and we mu&s;t po&s;itively proceed; Attalus was not in a humour to &s;ubmit with patience to di&s;appointments, &s;o that having ordered two of his &s;ervants to di&s;mount, we took their hor&s;es and &s;et off upon our tour; the beauties of na|ture were before us, but that &s;erenity of mind which &s;hould ever accompany the contemplation of tho&s;e beauties, was wanting; Attalus was one of fortune's &s;poilt children, and his temper, grown
<PB N="30" REF="37">
irritable by indulgence and humour&s;ome by pro&s;|perity, had lo&s;t it's reli&s;h for &s;implicity and was wholly given up to a &s;illy pa&s;&s;ion for o&s;tentation and parade; he immediately began to harangue upon the many evil qualities of &s;ervants, a topic at the be&s;t unedifying and commonly mo&s;t di&s;|gu&s;ting to the hearers; he bewailed his own ill-fortune in that re&s;pect very bitterly, and &s;o much of the way pa&s;&s;ed off before this philippic was concluded, that I began to think I had been carried out for no better purpo&s;e than to hear a declamation in the open air: I brought him at la&s;t to a &s;top by ob&s;erving he had a paradi&s;e about him, and that it was a pity his vexations did not &s;uffer him to enjoy it&mdash;Upon this hint he &s;eemed to recollect him&s;elf and proceeded to expatiate upon his own improvements, pointing out to me what he had done, and what he had more in mind to do, if his over&s;eer had obeyed his in&s;tructions, and proper people had been found to execute his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>I took notice of a group of neat cottages, which had a very picture&s;que and plea&s;ing ap|pearance, for they were deliciou&s;ly &s;ituated, and had all the air, as I ob&s;erved, of happy habita|tions&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No matter for that,"</Q> replied Attalus,
<Q REND="inline">"down they mu&s;t all come, for they are cruelly in my eye, and I purpo&s;e to throw all that hill
<PB N="31" REF="38">
into wilderne&s;s with plantations of pine, where you &s;ee the rock and broken ground, which will be a bold and &s;triking contra&s;t to the or|namented grounds about it&mdash;I am &s;urpri&s;ed,"</Q>added he,
<Q REND="inline">"you can &s;ee any beauty in tho&s;e paltry huts."</Q>&mdash;Before I could make reply, an old pea&s;ant had approached us, and humbly en|quired of Attalus, when he was to be di&s;lodged from his cottage&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have ordered the work|men to take it down next week,"</Q>&s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline">"the &s;ea&s;on is favorable for your removal and you mu&s;t &s;eek out el&s;ewhere."</Q>The decree was heard without an effort to reply; a &s;igh was all the plea the poor man offered, and with that &s;igh he &s;ent a look to heaven, that in its pa&s;&s;age rent my heart: I determined to be gone next morning.</P>
<P>We proceeded in our circuit till we were cro&s;&s;ed by a high enclo&s;ure, which awkwardly enough &s;eparated a pa&s;ture of about three acres, in which was a brick-kiln too con&s;picuou&s;ly placed not to annoy the &s;ight, and at that very moment too furiou&s;ly employed in the act of duty, not to be exce&s;&s;ively offen&s;ive to the &s;mell; we found our&s;elves involved in columns of thick &s;moke, which were not of the mo&s;t grateful odour in the world; I confe&s;s I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the location of this flaming nui&s;ance,
<PB N="32" REF="39">
and as we were making our way through the &s;mothering cloud, remarked to Attalus that or|nament mu&s;t give place to u&s;e&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I brought you hither,"</Q>&s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline">"purpo&s;ely to &s;hew you how I am treated by a &s;urly ob&s;tinate fellow in my neighbourhood, who has not another foot of land in the world, but this cur&s;ed patch of ground, and which the ra&s;cal keeps on purpo&s;e to &s;pite me, though I have bidden three times the value of it: indeed it is indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary to me, as you may well believe by the annoyance it produces in his hands; I have tried all means to get it from him, rough and &s;mooth, and if a pro&s;ecution would have laid again&s;t it, I would have driven him out of it by the expences of a &s;uit; but all to no pur|po&s;e; I am &s;o tormented by the fellow's ob&s;ti|nacy, and my comforts are &s;o &s;acrificed by the nui&s;ance, that I have no longer any enjoyment in my place; nay I have &s;topped mo&s;t of my works and di&s;charged my labourers, for what &s;ignifies carrying on improvements, when I can no longer live in my hou&s;e with that cur&s;ed brick-kiln for ever in my eye, and with little intermi&s;&s;ion in my no&s;trils al&s;o?"</Q></P>
<P>A new theme of di&s;content was now &s;tarted, which the unhappy Attalus pur&s;ued with heavy complaints as we travelled down a &s;tream of
<PB N="33" REF="40">
&s;moke, which &s;eemed as if maliciou&s;ly to pur&s;ue us, determined not to quit it's execrator, till he left off his execrations; at la&s;t they both cea&s;ed in the &s;ame moment and parted by con&s;ent. As &s;oon as Attalus de&s;i&s;ted from his invectives I took up my reflections, and if a wi&s;h could have purcha&s;ed his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, encumbered with the vexations of their owner, I would not have taken them at the price. Down &s;unk the vi&s;ion of pro&s;perity; &s;wifter than the &s;hifting of a play|hou&s;e &s;cene vani&s;hed all the enchanting pro&s;pect; a naked lodge in a warren with content had been more enviable in my eye than his palace haunted with di&s;gu&s;t; I &s;aw Attalus, the verie&s;t darling of fortune, &s;ickening and &s;urfeited with pro&s;pe|rity; peevi&s;h with his &s;ervants, un&s;ociable to his neighbours, a &s;lave to fa&s;hions, which he obeyed and di&s;approved, unfeeling to the poor, tired with the &s;plendor of a magnificent hou&s;e, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an exten&s;ive territory, yet &s;ighing after a &s;mall nook of land, the want of which poi&s;oned all his comforts.&mdash;And what then are riches? &s;aid I within my&s;elf. The di&s;turbers of human happine&s;s; the corrupters of human nature. I remember this Attalus in his youth; I knew him intimately at &s;chool and college; he was of a joyous, &s;ocial temper; placid, accommodating, full of re&s;ource; always in good humour with
<PB N="34" REF="41">
him&s;elf and the world, and he had a heart as liberal and compa&s;&s;ionate as it was &s;incere and open; this great e&s;tate was then out of &s;ight; it mu&s;t be this e&s;tate then, which has wrought the unhappy change in his manners and di&s;po&s;ition; and if riches operate thus upon a nature like his, where is the wonder if we meet &s;o many wretch|es, who derive their wants from their abun|dance?</P>

<P>THOUGH I think our nation can never be accu&s;ed of want of charity, yet I have ob&s;erved with much concern a poor unhappy &s;et of men among&s;t us, who&s;e ca&s;e is not commi&s;e|rated as it ought to be;&mdash;and as I would gladly contribute any thing in my power towards their relief, the be&s;t proof I can give them of my good will is by endeavouring to convince them of a certain truth, which all the world except them|&s;elves
<PB N="36" REF="43">
has di&s;covered long ago, <HI>viz.&mdash;That a proud man is the mo&s;t contemptible being in nature.</HI>&mdash;Now if the&s;e proud men, to whom I addre&s;s my&s;elf and for who&s;e mi&s;erable &s;ituation I have &s;uch compa&s;&s;ion, &s;hall once find a friend to con|vince them, that they are truly <HI>the mo&s;t con|temptible beings in nature,</HI> it can never be &s;uppo|&s;ed they will per&s;i&s;t to entertain a companion in their bo&s;oms, who affords them &s;o little plea&s;ure, and yet involves them in &s;o much di&s;grace. I mu&s;t con&s;ider them therefore as mi&s;taken rather than ob&s;tinate, and treat them accordingly; for how can I &s;uppo&s;e there would be &s;uch an ab|&s;urdity in the world as a proud man, if the poor creature was not behind hand with the re&s;t of mankind in a di&s;covery that concerns him&s;elf &s;o materially? I admit indeed that pride is a very fooli&s;h thing, but I contend that wi&s;e men are &s;ometimes &s;urprized into very fooli&s;h things, and if a little friendly hint can re&s;cue them, it would be an ill-natured action to withhold the informa|tion: <Q REND="inline">"If you are proud, you are a fool"</Q>&mdash;&s;ays an old Greek author called <HI>Sotades</HI>&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">&mdash;but I hope a little plain Engli&s;h, without the help of <HI>Sotades,</HI> will &s;erve to open the eyes of a plain Engli&s;h|man, and prevent him from &s;trutting about the
<PB N="37" REF="44">
world merely to make &s;port for his neighbours; for I declare in truth, that &s;o far from being an|noyed and made &s;plenetic as &s;ome folks are, when I fall into company with a proud fellow creature, I feel no other impul&s;e than of pity, with now and then a &s;mall propen&s;ity to titter, for it would be downright rudene&s;s to laugh in a man's face on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and it hurts me to &s;ee an ho|ne&s;t gentleman, who may have many more natu|ral good qualities, than he him&s;elf is aware of, run about from hou&s;e to hou&s;e only to make &s;port for the &s;coffers, and take a world of pains and put on an air of gravity and importance for no better purpo&s;e than to provoke ridicule and con|tempt&mdash;<HI>Why is earth and a&s;hes proud?</HI> &s;ays the Son of Sirach; <HI>Pride was not made for men.</HI></P>
<P>As I am determined to put the&s;e poor men upon their guard in all points, I &s;hall remind them of another error they are in, which &s;adly aggravates their misfortunes, and which ari&s;es from a circum&s;tance of a mere local nature, viz. <HI>That England is the wor&s;t country a proud man can exhibit him&s;elf in.</HI>&mdash;I do really wi&s;h they would well con&s;ider the land they live in; if they do not know, they ought to be told, that we are a free people; that freedom tends to make us independent of one another, fearle&s;s in our per|&s;ons,
<PB N="38" REF="45">
warm in our re&s;entments, bold of tongue and vindictive again&s;t in&s;ult; England is the place upon earth, where a proud &s;tomach finds the lea&s;t to feed upon; indeed it is the only &s;to|mach, that can here complain of its entertain|ment: if the proud man thinks it will be &s;ufficient to pay his fine of affability to his neighbours once in &s;even years upon a parliamentary canva&s;s, he is cruelly mi&s;taken; the common people in this country have &s;uch a &s;hare of intuition, under|&s;tand their own &s;trength &s;o well, and &s;crutinize into the weakne&s;&s;es of their &s;uperiors &s;o acutely, that they are neither to be deceived nor intimi|dated; and on that account, (as the proud man's character is compounded of the impo&s;tor and the bully) they are the very wor&s;t people he can deal with. A man may &s;trut in Spain, vapour in France, or kick and cuff the vulgar as he likes in Ru&s;&s;ia; he may &s;it erect in his palanquin in India without dropping his eyes upon the earth he moves over; but if he carries his head in the air here, and expects the crowd to make way for him, he will &s;oon run foul of &s;omebody that will make him repent of his &s;tateline&s;s. Pride then, it &s;eems, not only expo&s;es a man to contempt, but puts him in danger; it is al&s;o a very expen|&s;ive frolick, if he keeps it up as it &s;hould be kept,
<PB N="39" REF="46">
for what &s;ignifies his being proud, if there is not &s;omebody always pre&s;ent to exerci&s;e his pride upon? He mu&s;t therefore of nece&s;&s;ity have a &s;et of humble cou&s;ins and toad-eaters about him, and as &s;uch cattle cannot be had for nothing in this country, he mu&s;t pay them according to the value of their &s;ervices; common tra&s;h may be had at a common price, but clever fellows know their own con&s;equence, and will &s;tand out upon terms: If Nebuchadnezzar had not had <HI>all people, nations and languages</HI> at his command, he might have called till he was hoar&s;e before any one would have come to wor&s;hip his <HI>image in the plain of Dura</HI>; let the proud man take notice withal that Nebuchadnezzar's <HI>image</HI> was made of <HI>gold,</HI> and if he expects to be wor&s;hipped by all people after this fa&s;hion, and ca&s;ts him&s;elf in the &s;ame mould, he mu&s;t al&s;o ca&s;t him&s;elf in the &s;ame metal. Now if I am right in my a&s;&s;ertion, that &s;ycophants bear a higher price in England than el&s;ewhere (and, if &s;carcity makes things dear, I tru&s;t they do) let the proud man con&s;ider if it be worth his while to pay dear for bad company, when he may have good-fellow&s;hip at an ea&s;y rate: Here then is another in&s;tance of his bad policy, and &s;ure it is a &s;orrowful thing to be poor and proud.</P>
<P>That I may thoroughly do my duty to an order
<PB N="40" REF="47">
of men, to who&s;e &s;ervice I dedicate this &s;hort e&s;|&s;ay, I mu&s;t not omit to mention, that it behoves a proud man in all places and on all occa&s;ions to pre&s;erve an air of gloomine&s;s and melancholy, and never to &s;uffer &s;o vulgar an expre&s;&s;ion as mirth or laughter to di&s;arrange the decorum of his fea|tures: other men will be apt to make merry with his humour, but he mu&s;t never be made merry by their's: In this re&s;pect he is truly to be pitied, for if once he grows &s;ociable he is undone. On the contrary, he mu&s;t for ever remain in the very predicament of the proud man de&s;cribed in the fragment of Euripides's Ixion&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">&mdash;<HI>Urbi atque amicis pariter in&s;ocia|bilis:</HI> He mu&s;t have no friend, for that would be to admit an equal; he mu&s;t take no advice, for that would be to acknowledge a &s;uperior: Such &s;ociety as he can find in his own thoughts, and &s;uch wi&s;dom as he was &s;ent into the world with, &s;uch he mu&s;t go on with: as wit is not ab&s;olutely annexed to pedigree in this country, and arts and &s;ciences &s;ometimes conde&s;cend to throw their beams upon the low-born and the humble, it is not po&s;&s;ible for the proud man to de&s;cend among&s;t them for information and &s;ociety; if truth does not hang within his reach, he will never dive into a well to fetch it up: His er|rors, like &s;ome arguments, move <HI>in a circle</HI>; for

his pride begets ignorance, and his ignorance be|gets pride; and thus in the end he has more rea|&s;ons for being <HI>melancholy</HI> than <HI>Ma&s;ter Stephen</HI> had, not only becau&s;e it is <HI>gentleman-like,</HI> but becau&s;e he can't help it, and don't know how to be merry.</P>
<P>I might enumerate many more properties of this contemptible character, but the&s;e are enough, and a proud man is &s;o dull a fellow at be&s;t that I &s;hall gladly take my leave of him; I confe&s;s al&s;o that I am not able to treat the &s;ubject in any other than a vague and de&s;ultory manner, for I know not how to define it my&s;elf, and at the &s;ame time am not reconciled to any other de|finition of pride, which I have met in Mr. Locke's e&s;&s;ay or el&s;ewhere. It is called a pa&s;&s;ion, and yet it has not the e&s;&s;entials of a pa&s;&s;ion; for I can bring to mind nothing under that de&s;cription, which has not reference either to God, to our fellow-creatures, or to our&s;elves.&mdash;The &s;en&s;ual pa&s;&s;ions for in&s;tance of whatever &s;ort have their end in &s;elfi&s;h gratification; the generous attributes, &s;uch as valour, friend&s;hip, public &s;pirit, munificence and contempt of dan|ger have re&s;pect to our fellow-creatures; they look for their account in an honorable fame, in the enjoyment of pre&s;ent prai&s;e and in the anti|cipation
<PB N="42" REF="49">
of that, which po&s;terity &s;hall be&s;tow; whil&s;t the le&s;s o&s;tentatious and purer virtues of &s;elf-denial, re&s;ignation, humility, piety, forbear|ance and many others are addre&s;&s;ed to God alone, they offer no gratification to &s;elf, they &s;eek for no applau&s;e from man. But in which of the&s;e three general cla&s;&s;es &s;hall we di&s;cover the pa&s;&s;ion of pride? I have indeed &s;ometimes &s;een it under the cloak of religion, but nothing can be more oppo&s;ite to the practice of it: It is in vain to enquire for it among&s;t the generous and &s;ocial attributes, for it's place is no where to be found in &s;ociety; and I am equally at a lo&s;s to think how that can be called a &s;elfi&s;h gratification, which brings nothing home to a man's heart but mortification, contempt, abhor|rence, &s;ecret di&s;content and public ridicule. It is compo&s;ed of contraries, and founded in ab|&s;urdity; for at the &s;ame time that it cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the world's re&s;pect, it is &s;o con&s;tituted as never to obtain it. Anger is proverbially termed a &s;hort madne&s;s, but pride methinks is a perpetual one; if I had been inclined to u&s;e a &s;ofter word, I would have called it folly; I do confe&s;s I have often &s;een it in that more venial character, and therefore not to decide upon the point too ha&s;tily, I &s;hall leave the proud man to
<PB N="43" REF="50">
make his choice between folly and madne&s;s, and take out his commi&s;&s;ion from which party he &s;ees fit.</P>
<P>Good heaven! how plea&s;ant, how compla|cent to it&s;elf and others is an humble di&s;po&s;ition! To a &s;oul &s;o tempered how delightfully life pa&s;&s;es in brotherly love and &s;implicity of man|ners! Every eye be&s;tows the chearing look of approbation upon the humble man; every brow frowns contempt upon the proud. Let me therefore advi&s;e every gentleman, when he finds him&s;elf inclined to take up the character of pride, to con&s;ider well whether he can be quite proud enough for all purpo&s;es of life; whether his pride reaches to that pitch as to meet uni|ver&s;al contempt with indifference; whether it will bear him out again&s;t mortification, when he finds him&s;elf excluded from &s;ociety, and under|&s;tands that he is ridiculed by every body in it; whether it is convenient to him always to walk with a &s;tiff back and a &s;tern countenance; and la&s;tly, whether he is perfectly &s;ure, that he has that &s;trength and &s;elf-&s;upport in his own human nature, as may defy the power and &s;et at nought the favor of God, <HI>who re&s;i&s;teth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</HI></P>
<P>There is yet another little ea&s;y proce&s;s, which I would recommend to him as a kind of proba|tionary
<PB N="44" REF="51">
rehear&s;al before he performs in public: I am per&s;uaded it will not be ami&s;s if he fir&s;t runs over a few of his airs and graces by him|&s;elf in his own clo&s;et: Let him examine him|&s;elf from head to foot in his gla&s;s, and if he finds him&s;elf no hand&s;omer, no &s;tronger, no taller than all the re&s;t of his fellow-creatures, he may ven|ture without ri&s;que to conclude that he like them is a man, and nothing more: Having &s;et|tled this point, and taken place in the human creation, he may next proceed to con&s;ider what that place ought to be; for this purpo&s;e he may con&s;ult his pedigree and his rent-roll, and if upon a careful peru&s;al of the&s;e documents he &s;hall find, (as mo&s;t likely he will) that he is not decidedly the noble&s;t and the riche&s;t man in the world, perhaps he will &s;ee no good cau&s;e, why he &s;hould &s;trut over the face of it, as if it was his own: I would then have him go back to his gla&s;s, and &s;et his features in order for the very proude&s;t and mo&s;t arrogant look he can put on; let him knit his brow, &s;tretch his no&s;trils and bite his lips with all the dignity he can &s;ummon, and after this, when he has rever&s;ed the experi|ment by &s;oftening them into a mild complacent look, with as much benignity as he can find in his heart to be&s;tow upon them, let him a&s;k him|&s;elf hone&s;tly and fairly, which character be&s;t
<PB N="45" REF="52">
becomes him, and whether he does not look more like a man with &s;ome humanity than with|out it: I would in the next place have him call his under&s;tanding to a &s;hort audit, and upon ca&s;ting up the &s;um total of his wit, learning, talents and accompli&s;hments, compute the ba|lance between others and him&s;elf, and if it &s;hall turn out that his &s;tock of all the&s;e is not the prodigious thing it ought to be, and even greater than all other men's, he will do well to hu&s;band it with a little frugal humility: The la&s;t thing he mu&s;t do, (and if he does nothing el&s;e I &s;hould hope it would be &s;ufficient) is to take down his bible from the &s;helf, and look out for the parable of the Phari&s;ee and Publican; it is a &s;hort &s;tory and &s;oon read, but the moral is &s;o much to his purpo&s;e, that he may depend upon it, if that does not correct his pride, his pride is incorrigible, and all the <HI>Ob&s;ervers</HI> in the world will be but wa&s;te paper in his &s;ervice.</P>

<P>THERE is a certain delicacy in &s;ome men's nature, which though not ab&s;o|lutely to be termed a moral attribute, is never|thele&s;s &s;o grateful to &s;ociety at large and &s;o re|commendatory of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it, that even the be&s;t and worthie&s;t characters cannot be truly plea&s;ing without it: I know not how to de&s;cribe it better than by &s;aying it con&s;i&s;ts in a happy di&s;cernment of <HI>times and &s;ea&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>Though this engaging talent cannot po&s;itively be called a virtue, yet it &s;eems to be the re&s;ult of many virtuous and refined endowments of the mind, which produces it; for when we &s;ee any man &s;o tenderly con&s;iderate of our feelings, as to put a&s;ide his own for our accommodation and repo&s;e, and to con&s;ult opportunities with a re|&s;pectful attention to our ea&s;e and lei&s;ure, it is natural to us to think favorably of &s;uch a di&s;po|&s;ition, and although much of his di&s;cernment may be the effect of a good judgment and proper knowledge of the world, yet there mu&s;t be a great proportion of &s;en&s;ibility, candor, diffi|dence
<PB N="47" REF="54">
and natural mode&s;ty in the compo&s;ition of a faculty &s;o conciliating and &s;o graceful. A man may have many good qualities, and yet if he is unacquainted with the world, he will rarely be found to under&s;tand tho&s;e apt and happy mo|ments, of which I am now &s;peaking; for it is a knowledge not to be gained without a nice and accurate ob&s;ervation of mankind, and even when that ob&s;ervation has given it, men, who are wanting in the natural good qualities above de|&s;cribed, may indeed avail them&s;elves of &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions to &s;erve a purpo&s;e of their own, but without a good heart no man will apply his ex|perience to general practice.</P>
<P>But as it is not upon theories that I wi&s;h to employ the&s;e papers, I &s;hall now devote the re|mainder of my attention to &s;uch rules and ob|&s;ervations as occur to me upon the &s;ubject of <HI>the times and &s;ea&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>Men, who in the fa&s;hionable phra&s;e <HI>live out of the world,</HI> have a certain awkwardne&s;s about them, which is for ever putting them out of their place in &s;ociety, whenever they are occa|&s;ionally drawn into it. If it is their &s;tudies which have &s;eque&s;tered them from the world, they contract an air of pedantry, which can hardly be endured in any mixed company with|out expo&s;ing the object of it to ridicule; for the
<PB N="48" REF="55">
very e&s;&s;ence of this contracted habit con&s;i&s;ts in an utter ignorance <HI>of times and &s;ea&s;ons.</HI> Mo&s;t of that cla&s;s of men who are occupied in the edu|cation of youth, and not a few of the young men them&s;elves, who are educated by them, are of this de&s;cription: We meet with many of <HI>Jack Lizard</HI>'s ca&s;t in the Spectator, who will learn|edly maintain <HI>there is no heat in fire.</HI> There is a di&s;putatious preci&s;ion in the&s;e people, which lets nothing pa&s;s in free conver&s;ation, that is not mathematically true; they will confute a je&s;t by &s;yllogi&s;m, canva&s;s a merry tale by cro&s;s-exami|nation and dates, work every common calcula|tion by X <HI>the unknown quantity,</HI> and in the fe&s;tive &s;allies of imagination convict the witty &s;peaker of fal&s;e grammar, and non&s;uit all the merriment of the table.</P>
<P>The man of form and ceremony, who has &s;haped his manners to the model of what is commonly called <HI>The Old Court,</HI> is another grand defaulter again&s;t <HI>times and &s;ea&s;ons:</HI> His entrances and exits are to be performed with a &s;tated re|gularity; he mea&s;ures his devoirs with an exac|titude that be&s;peaks him a correct interpreter of <HI>The Red Book</HI>; pays his compliments with a minutene&s;s, that leaves no one of your family unnamed, enquires after the health of your child who is dead, and de&s;ires to be kindly remem|bered
<PB N="49" REF="56">
to your wife, from whom you are di|vorced: Nature formed him in &s;trait lines, habit has &s;tiffened him into an unrelenting rigidity, and no familiarity can bend him out of the up|right. The uneducated &s;quire of ru&s;tic man|ners forms a contra&s;t to this character, but he is altogether as great an intruder upon <HI>times and &s;ea&s;ons,</HI> and his total want of form operates to the annoyance of &s;ociety as effectually as the other's exce&s;s. There cannot be in human nature a more terrible thing than vulgar fa|miliarity; a low-bred fellow, who affects to put him&s;elf at his ea&s;e among&s;t his &s;uperiors and be plea&s;ant company to them, is a nui&s;ance to &s;ociety; there is nothing &s;o ill under&s;tood by the world in general as familiarity; if it was not for the terror, which men have of the very trouble|&s;ome con&s;equences of conde&s;cen&s;ion to their in|feriors, there would not be a hundredth part of that pride and holding-back among&s;t the higher ranks, of which the low are &s;o apt to complain. How few men do we meet with, who when the heart is open and the channel free, know how to keep their cour&s;e within the buoys and marks, that true good-manners have &s;et up for all men to &s;teer by! Jokes out of &s;ea&s;on, unplea&s;ant truths touched upon incautiou&s;ly, <HI>plump que&s;tions</HI> (as they are called) put without any preface or

refinement, manual care&s;&s;es compounded of hugs and &s;laps and &s;queezes, more re&s;embling the gambols of a bear than the actions of a gentle|man, are &s;ure to follow upon the overflowing ebullitions of a vulgar familiarity broke loo&s;e from all re&s;traints. It is a painful nece&s;&s;ity men of &s;en&s;ibility are under, when they find them|&s;elves compelled to draw back from the eager advances of an hone&s;t heart, only becau&s;e the &s;hock of it's good-humour is too violent to be endured; it is very wounding to a &s;ocial nature to check fe&s;tivity in any degree, but there is no|thing &s;inks the &s;pirits &s;o effectually as boi&s;terous mirth, nobody &s;o apt to overact his character as a jolly fellow, and &s;tunned with the vociferation of his own tongue to forget that every other man is &s;ilent and &s;uffering: In &s;hort it is a very difficult thing to be properly happy and well plea&s;ed with the company we are in, and none but men of good education, great di&s;cernment and nice feelings know how to be familiar. The&s;e rural gentry are great dealers in long &s;tories of their own unintere&s;ting atchievements, they require of you to attend to the narrative of their paltry &s;quabbles and bickerings with their neighbours; they are extremely eloquent upon the laws again&s;t poachers, upon turnpike roads and new enclo&s;ures, and all the&s;e topicks they

will thru&s;t in by the neck and &s;houlders to the exclu&s;ion of all others.</P>
<P>Plain-&s;peaking, if we con&s;ider it &s;imply as a mark of truth and hone&s;ty, is doubtle&s;s a very meritorious quality, but experience teaches that it is too frequently under bad management, and obtruded on &s;ociety out of <HI>time and &s;ea&s;on</HI> in &s;uch a manner as to be highly inconvenient and offen&s;ive. People are not always in a fit hu|mour to be told of their faults, and the&s;e plain-&s;peaking friends &s;ometimes perform their office &s;o clum&s;ily, that we are inclined to &s;u&s;pect they are more intere&s;ted to bring us to pre&s;ent &s;hame than future reformation: It is a common ob|&s;ervation with them, when things turn out ami&s;s, to put us in mind how they di&s;&s;uaded us from &s;uch and &s;uch an undertaking, that they fore&s;aw what would happen, and that the event is neither more nor le&s;s than they expected and predicted. The&s;e retorts, ca&s;t in our teeth in the very moment of vexation, are what few tempers, when galled with di&s;appointment, can patiently put up with; they may po&s;&s;ibly be the pure re&s;ult of zeal and &s;incerity, but they are &s;o void of contrivance and there is &s;o little delicacy in the timing of them, that it is a very rare ca&s;e indeed, when they happen to be well under&s;tood and kindly taken.
<PB N="52" REF="59">
The &s;ame want of &s;en&s;ibility towards human in|firmities, that will not &s;pare us in the moments of vexation, will make no allowances for the mind's debility in the hours of grief and &s;orrow: If a friend of this &s;ort &s;urpri&s;es us in the weak|ne&s;s of the &s;oul, when death perhaps has robbed us of &s;ome beloved object, it is not to contribute a tear, but to read us a lecture, that he comes; when the heart is agoni&s;ed, the temper is irrita|ble, and as a morali&s;er of this &s;ort is almo&s;t &s;ure to find his admonitions take the contrary effect from what he intended, he is apt to mi&s;take an occa&s;ional impatience in us for a natural one, and leaves us with the impre&s;&s;ion that we are men, who are ill prepared again&s;t the common vici&s;&s;itudes of life, and endowed with a very &s;mall &s;hare of fortitude and re&s;ignation; this early mi&s;conception of our character in the cour&s;e of time leads him to another, for he no &s;ooner finds us recovered to a proper temper of mind, than he calls to mind our former impa|tience and comparing it with our pre&s;ent tran|quillity concludes upon appearances, that we are men of light and trivial natures, &s;ubject indeed to &s;its and &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion, but incapable of re|tention, and as he has then a fine &s;ubject for di&s;playing his powers of plain-&s;peaking, he re|minds us of our former inattention to his good
<PB N="53" REF="60">
advice and takes credit for having told us over and over again that we ought not to give way to violent &s;orrow, and that we could not change the cour&s;e of things by our complaining of them. Thus for want of calculating <HI>times and &s;ea&s;ons</HI> he begins to think de&s;pi&s;ingly of us, and we in &s;pite of all his &s;incerity grow tired of him and dread his company.</P>
<P>Before I quit this &s;ubject I mu&s;t al&s;o have a word with the valetudinarians, and I wi&s;h from my heart I could cure them of their <HI>complaints,</HI>&mdash;that &s;pecies I mean which comes under my no|tice as an <HI>Ob&s;erver,</HI> without intruding upon the more important province of the phy&s;ician. Now as this i&s;land of our's is mo&s;t happily &s;upplied with a large and learned body of profe&s;&s;ors under every medical de&s;cription and character, whe|ther operative or deliberative, and all the&s;e &s;tand ready at the call and devoted to the &s;ervice of the &s;ick or maimed, whether it be on foot, on hor&s;eback or on wheels to re&s;ort to them in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, it cannot be for want of help that the valetudinarian &s;tates his ca&s;e to all com|panies &s;o promi&s;cuou&s;ly. Let the whole family of death be arrayed on one &s;ide, and the whole army of phy&s;ic, regulars and irregulars, be drawn out on the other, and I will venture to &s;ay that for every po&s;&s;ible di&s;ea&s;e in the ranks of the be|&s;ieger,
<PB N="54" REF="61">
there &s;hall be a champion in the garri&s;on ready to turn out and give him battle: Let all who are upon the &s;ick li&s;t in the community be laid out between the camps, and let the re&s;pec|tive combatants fight it out over the bodies, but let the forces of life and health have no &s;hare in the fray: Why &s;hould their peace be di&s;turbed, or their &s;ociety contaminated by the infectious communication? It is as much out of <HI>time and place</HI> for a man to be giving the diary of his di&s;ea&s;e in company, who are met for &s;ocial pur|po&s;es, as it is for a doctor to be talking politics or &s;candal in a &s;ick man's chamber; yet &s;o it is that each party are for ever out of character; the chatterer di&s;gu&s;ts his patient by an inatten|tion to his complaints, and the valetudinarian di&s;gu&s;ts his company by the enumeration of them, and both are equally out of &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Every man's ob&s;ervation may furni&s;h him with in&s;tances not here enumerated, but if what I have &s;aid &s;hall &s;eem to merit more con&s;idera|tion than I have been able to give it in the com|pa&s;s of this paper, my readers may improve upon the hint and &s;ociety cannot fail to profit by their reflections.</P>

<P>A CURIOUS Greek fragment has been lately di&s;covered by an ingenious tra|veller at Con&s;tantinople, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;aved out of the famous Alexandrian library, when &s;et on fire by command of the Caliph. There is nothing but conjecture to guide us to the author: Some learned men, who have examined it, give it to <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> others to <HI>Aelian</HI>; &s;ome contend for <HI>Suidas,</HI> others for <HI>Libanius</HI>; but mo&s;t agree in a&s;cribing it to &s;ome one of the Greek &s;ophi&s;ts, &s;o that it is not to be di&s;gui&s;ed that ju&s;t doubts are to be entertained of it's veracity in point of fact. There may be much ingenuity in the&s;e di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, but we are not to expect conviction; therefore I &s;hall pa&s;s to the &s;ubject-matter, and not concern my&s;elf with any previous argumentation on a que&s;tion, that is never likely to be &s;ettled.</P>
<Q><P>This fragment &s;ays that &s;ome time after the death of the great dramatic poet Ae&s;chylus, there was a certain citizen of Athens named <HI>Philoteuchus,</HI> who by his indu&s;try and fair cha|racter
<PB N="56" REF="63">
in trade had acquired a plentiful fortune, and came in time to be actually cho&s;en one of the Areopagites: This man in an advanced pe|riod of his life engaged in a very &s;plendid un|dertaking for collecting a &s;eries of pictures to be compo&s;ed from &s;cenes in the tragedies of the great poet above-mentioned, and to be executed by the Athenian arti&s;ts, who were then both numerous and eminent.</P>
<P>The old Areopagite with a &s;pirit, that would have done honour to <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus</HI> or <HI>Pericles,</HI> con&s;tructed a &s;pacious lyceum for the reception of the&s;e pictures, which he laid open to the re|&s;ort both of citizens and &s;trangers, and the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the work reflected equal credit upon the undertaker and the arti&s;ts, whom he employed.</P></Q>
<P>The chain of the narration is here broken by a lo&s;s of part of the fragment, which how|ever is fortunately re&s;umed in that place, where the writer gives &s;ome account of the ma&s;ters, who painted for this collection, and of the &s;cenes they made choice of for their &s;everal pictures.</P>
<Q><P>He tells us that <HI>Apelles</HI> was then living and in the vigour of his genius, though advanced in years; he de&s;cribes the &s;cene cho&s;en for his compo&s;ition minutely, and it appears to have been taken from that &s;uite of dramas, which we know <HI>Ae&s;chylus</HI> compo&s;ed from the &s;tory of the
<PB N="57" REF="64">
<HI>Atridae,</HI> and of which we have &s;till &s;uch valuable remains. He repre&s;ents <HI>Aegi&s;thus,</HI> after the murder of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> by the in&s;tigation of <HI>Cly|temne&s;tra,</HI> in the act of con&s;ulting certain Sybils, who by their magical &s;pells and incantations have rai&s;ed the gho&s;t of <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> which is attended by a train of phantoms, emblematic of eight &s;ucce&s;&s;ive kings of Argos, his immediate de&s;cendants: The &s;pectre is made <HI>pointing</HI> to his po&s;terity, and at the &s;ame time looking on his murderer with a &s;mile, in which <HI>Apelles</HI> con|trived to give the &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions of con|tempt, exultation and revenge with &s;uch a cha|racter of gha&s;tly pain and horror, as to make the beholders &s;hrink. Among&s;t the&s;e Sybils he in|troduces the per&s;on of <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra</HI> the prophete&s;s, whom <HI>Agamemnon</HI> brought captive from the de|&s;truction of Troy. The light, he &s;ays, pro|ceeds only from a flaming cauldron, in which the Sybils have been making their libations to the infernal deities or furies, and he &s;peaks of the reflected, ruddy tints, which by this manage|ment of the arti&s;t were ca&s;t upon the figures, as producing a wonderful effect, and giving an amazing horror and magnificence to the group. Upon the whole he &s;tates it as the mo&s;t capital performance of the ma&s;ter, and that he got &s;uch univer&s;al honour thereby, that he was afterwards
<PB N="58" REF="65">
employed to paint for the Per&s;ian monarch, and had a commi&s;&s;ion even from the queen of Scy|thia, a country then emerging from barbarity.</P>
<P><HI>Parrha&s;ius,</HI> though born in the colony of Miletus on the coa&s;t of A&s;ia, was an adopted citizen of Athens and in great credit there for his celebrated picture on the death of <HI>Epami|nondas:</HI> He contributed to this collection by a very capital compo&s;ition taken from a tragedy, which was the third in a &s;eries of dramas, founded by <HI>Ae&s;chylus</HI> on the well-known &s;tory of <HI>Oedipus,</HI> all which are lo&s;t. The mi&s;erable monarch, who&s;e misfortunes had overturned his rea&s;on, is here depicted taking &s;helter under a wretched hovel in the mid&s;t of a tremendous &s;torm, where the elements &s;eem con&s;piring again&s;t a helple&s;s being in the la&s;t &s;tage of hu|man mi&s;ery. The painter has thrown a very touching character of in&s;anity into his features, which plainly indicates that his lo&s;s of rea&s;on has ari&s;en from the tender rather than the inflam|matory pa&s;&s;ions; for there is a maje&s;tic &s;en&s;i|bility mixed with the wildne&s;s of his di&s;traction, which &s;till pre&s;erves the traces of the once be|nevolent monarch. In this de&s;olate &s;cene he has a few forlorn companions in his di&s;tre&s;s, which form a very peculiar group of per&s;onages; for they con&s;i&s;t of a venerable old man in a very
<PB N="59" REF="66">
piteous condition, who&s;e eyes have been torn from their &s;ockets, together with a naked ma|niac, who is &s;tarting from the hovel, where he had hou&s;ed him&s;elf during the tempe&s;t: The effect of this figure is de&s;cribed with rapture, for he is drawn in the prime of youth, beautiful and of a mo&s;t noble air; his naked limbs di&s;play the fine&s;t proportions of the human figure, and the mu&s;cular exertion of the &s;udden action he is thrown into furni&s;h ample &s;cope to the ana|tomical &s;cience of the arti&s;t. The fable feigns him to be the &s;on of the blind old man above de&s;cribed, and the fragment relates that his phren&s;y being not real but a&s;&s;umed, <HI>Parrha&s;ius</HI> availed him&s;elf of that circum&s;tance, and touched the character of his madne&s;s with &s;o nice and delicate a di&s;crimination from that of <HI>Oedipus,</HI> that an attentive ob&s;erver might have di&s;covered it to be counterfeited even without the clue of the &s;tory. There are two other attendant cha|racters in the group: One of the&s;e is a rough, hardy veteran, who &s;eems to brave the &s;torm with a certain air of contemptuous petulance in his countenance, that be&s;peaks a mind &s;uperior to fortune, and indignant under the vi&s;itation even of the gods them&s;elves. The other is a character, that &s;eems to have been a kind of imaginary creature of the poet, and is a buffoon
<PB N="60" REF="67">
or je&s;ter upon the model of Homer's Ther&s;ites, and was employed by <HI>Ae&s;chylus</HI> in his drama upon the old burle&s;que &s;y&s;tem of the Satyrs, as an occa&s;ional chorus or parody upon the &s;everer and more tragic characters of the piece.</P>
<P>The next picture in our author's catalogue was by the hand of <HI>Timanthes:</HI> This mode&s;t painter, though re&s;iding in the capital of <HI>Attica,</HI> lived in &s;uch retirement from &s;ociety, and was &s;o ab&s;olutely devoted to his art, that even his per&s;on was &s;carce known to his competitors. Envy never drew a word from his lips to the di&s;parage|ment of a contemporary, and emulation could hardly provoke his diffidence into a conte&s;t for fame, which &s;o many bolder rivals were prepared to di&s;pute.</P>
<P><HI>Ae&s;chylus,</HI> it is well known, wrote three plays on the fable of <HI>Prometheus</HI>; the &s;econd in this &s;eries is the <HI>Prometheus chained,</HI> which hap|pily &s;urvives; the la&s;t was <HI>Prometheus delivered,</HI> and from the opening &s;cene of this drama <HI>Ti|manthes</HI> formed his picture. <HI>Prometheus</HI> is here di&s;covered on the &s;ea-&s;hore upon an i&s;land inha|bited only by him&s;elf and his daughter, a young virgin of exqui&s;ite beauty, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;een none other of the human &s;pecies but her father, be&s;ides certain imaginary beings, whom <HI>Prom&eacute;theus</HI> had either created by his

&s;tolen fire, or whom he employed in the capacity of familiars for the purpo&s;es of his enchantments, for the poet very ju&s;tifiably &s;uppo&s;es him en|dowed with &s;upernatural powers, and by that vehicle brings to pa&s;s all the beautiful and &s;ur|pri&s;ing incidents of his drama. One of the&s;e a&euml;rial &s;pirits had by his command conjured up a mo&s;t dreadful tempe&s;t, in which a noble &s;hip is repre&s;ented as &s;inking in the mid&s;t of the breakers on this enchanted &s;hore. The daughter of <HI>Pro|metheus</HI> is &s;een in a &s;upplicating attitude im|ploring her father to <HI>allay</HI> the &s;torm, and &s;ave the &s;inking mariners from de&s;truction. In the back ground of the picture is a cavern, and at the entrance of it a mi&s;hapen &s;avage being, who&s;e evil nature is depicted in the deformity of his per&s;on and features, and who was employed by <HI>Prometheus</HI> in all &s;ervile offices, nece&s;&s;ary for his accommodation in this &s;olitude. The a&euml;rial &s;pirit is in the clouds, which he is driving before him at the <HI>behe&s;t</HI> of his great ma&s;ter. In this compo&s;ition therefore, although not replete with characters, there is yet &s;uch diver&s;ity of &s;tile and &s;ubject, that we have all, which the maje&s;ty and beauty of real nature can furni&s;h, with beings out of the regions of nature, as &s;trongly con|tra&s;ted in form and character, as fancy can de|vi&s;e: The &s;cenery al&s;o is of the &s;ublime&s;t ca&s;t,

The chorus was now withdrawn, and the poet no longer &s;poke his own &s;entiments or harangued his audience by proxy; parody is &s;atire of &s;o inferior a &s;pe|cies, that if comedy did not very &s;en&s;ibly decline in it's middle aera (which there is no rea&s;on to think was the ca&s;e), it mu&s;t have been upheld by a very &s;trong exertion of talents, or by collateral re&s;ources of a better &s;tamp than this, which we are &s;peaking of.

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>ALEXIS.</HEAD>
<P>This poet was a native of Thurium in Magna Graecia, a town celebrated for being the birth|place of Herodotus; he was great uncle by the father's &s;ide to Menander, and was the fir&s;t to di&s;cover and encourage the early genius of that admired writer. Alexis lived to a great age, and we have the authority of Plutarch for &s;aying that the vigour of his faculties was pre&s;erved to the la&s;t;

<PB N="66" REF="73">
found them crowned with the trophies of &s;uc|ce&s;s and triumphing in the plaudits of the theatre."</Q>The numerous productions of our poet confirm this a&s;&s;ertion of Plutarch, for Suidas &s;ays he was author of no le&s;s than two hundred and forty-five dramas, and I find the titles of one hundred and thirteen of this collection even now upon record; this proves that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very copious vein of invention, and the fragments, which remain out of the general wreck of his works, indicate the richne&s;s as well as copiou&s;|ne&s;s of that vein. The works of &s;uch a ma&s;ter were of them&s;elves a &s;tudy, and as Menander formed him&s;elf upon his in&s;tructions, we cannot fail to conceive very highly of the preceptor from the acknowledged excellence of the pupil. I di&s;cover a comedy of Alexis intitled <HI>Adelphi</HI>; it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed that Terence copied his comedy of that name from Menander, but unle&s;s his commentators have given &s;ome better rea&s;on, than I have yet met with, for the fact, it will bear a doubt at lea&s;t whether that elegant copy may not have been as much indebted to the uncle as to the nephew for the charms of it's dialogue and the delicacy of it's character.</P>
<P>Agellius informs us that Alexis formed the plot of one of his comedies upon the life and actions of Pythagoras; po&s;terity will give him credit for his choice, as we cannot conceive a

happier fable for an ingenious author to work upon, nor any that would afford a more fruitful field for facetious raillery than the extravagant and juggling tricks and contrivances, which that impo&s;tor's &s;tory teems with. Among&s;t his frag|ments I di&s;cover one little &s;crap, which, though a very &s;mall one, &s;eems to have been a &s;plinter of the wreck, wherein he ridicules a certain gluttonous Pythagorean, named Epicharides, for evading the ab&s;temious rule of his &s;ect for eating nothing that has life, by &s;wearing that his meat is killed before it is cooked; there can be no doubt but the tenour of the piece was altogether &s;atirical, for it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;ame man, who lampooned Plato, would &s;pare Pytha|goras; and that he did treat Plato in this con|temptuous &s;train we have the word of Laertius, who refers to no le&s;s than four of his comedies, in which he ridicules him very &s;everely; there is one &s;hort pa&s;&s;age &s;till remaining, which conveys a &s;neer at this philo&s;opher, and &s;o far as it goes confirms the anecdote, which Laertius gives us; but the biographer does more than the admirers of the divine Plato will thank him for, when he informs us of the grace and comeline&s;s of Alexis's per&s;on, and of Plato's partiality to him on that account; and among&s;t many other gal|lantries of the like nature we find &s;ome ver&s;es

This riddling de&s;cription of love I con&s;ider as a very curious fragment of the Greek comedy, as it has more play of words and le&s;s &s;implicity of thought and &s;tile, than I can recollect in any writer of this age and country. In general I think I can di&s;cover more antithe&s;is in the au|thors of the Middle Comedy than in any others, and I take it to have been one of the con&s;e|quences of parody. Phaedria's picture of love in the opening &s;cene of Terence's Eunuch is &s;ome|thing in the &s;tile of this fragment of Alexis, and the particular expre&s;&s;ion of&mdash;<HI>ut cum ratione in|&s;anias</HI>&mdash;&s;eems of a piece with&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">.

<P>Antiphanes of Smyrna, or, as &s;ome will have it, of Rhodes, was born in or about Olymp. XCIII.: His father's name was Demophanes, and his mother's Oenoe, people of &s;ervile degree; yet our poet, thus ignoble in his birth, lived to &s;ignalize him&s;elf by his genius, and was held in &s;uch re&s;pect by his Athenian patrons, that a pub|lic decree was made for the removal of his re|mains from the i&s;le of Chios, where he died at the age of &s;eventy-four, and for depo&s;iting them in the city of Athens, where his funeral honours were &s;umptuou&s;ly performed at the charge of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Various accounts are given of the number of his comedies, but of all the Greek dramati&s;ts he appears to have been the mo&s;t prolifick, for the lowe&s;t li&s;t of his plays amounts to two hundred and ninety, and &s;ome contend that he actually compo&s;ed three hundred and &s;ixty-five,

a number almo&s;t incredible if we had not the in|&s;tances of Calderon and De Vega too well au|thenticated to admit of a doubt in modern times to refer to.

We have now no other rule, whereby to mea&s;ure his merit, but in the &s;everal fragments &s;elected from his comedies by various authors of the lower ages, and the&s;e, though tolerably numerous, will &s;carce &s;uffice to give &s;uch an in&s;ight into the original, as may enable us to pronounce upon it's comparative excellence with any critical preci&s;ion: True it is, even the&s;e &s;mall reliques have agitated the curio&s;ity of the learned moderns, to whom &s;o many valuable authors are lo&s;t, but we cannot contemplate them without a &s;en&s;ible regret to find how few among&s;t them compri&s;e any &s;uch portion of the dialogue, as to open the character, &s;tile and manner of the writer, and not often enough to furni&s;h a conjecture at the fable they appertain to; they are like &s;mall crevices, letting in one feeble ray of light into a capa|cious building; they dart occa&s;ionally upon &s;ome rich and noble part, but they cannot con|vey to us a full and perfect idea of the &s;ymmetry and con&s;truction of the maje&s;tic whole.</P>

<P>Of AXIONICUS the comic poet I have no|thing to relate but that he was a writer of re|putation in the period we are de&s;cribing, and that we have the titles of &s;ix of his comedies with a &s;mall parcel of unintere&s;ting fragments, chiefly to be found in Athenaeus.</P>

Ari&s;totle relates that in his comedy of <HI>The Hippocentaur</HI> he introduced a rhap&s;ody, in which he contrived to mix every &s;pecies of metre, inventing as it &s;hould &s;eem a characteri&s;tic mea&s;ure for a compound mon&s;ter out of nature.</P>
<P>Of CLEARCHUS we have a few fragments and the titles of three comedies pre&s;erved by Athe|naeus; the &s;ame author gives us the title of one comedy by CRITON, of four by CROBYLUS and of two by DEMOXENUS, one of which is <HI>The Self-Tormentor,</HI> or <HI>Heautontimorumenos</HI>; this poet was an Athenian born, and &s;eems to have been a voluminous writer.

I meet with another fragment of this author, which is &s;o far curious, as it contains a bold bla&s;phemy again&s;t the &s;upreme of the heathen deities, and marks the very loo&s;e hold, which the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion had upon the minds of the common people of Athens at this period, who mu&s;t have been wonderfully changed by the new philo&s;ophy from the times of Ae&s;chylus and Ari&s;tophanes, who both incurred their re&s;ent|ment in a very high degree for daring to affront the Gods, though it is probable neither went the length of Diodorus's Para&s;ite, who a&s;&s;erts the &s;uperior dignity, authority and even divinity of his vocation with the following hardy allu&s;ion to Jupiter him&s;elf&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"All other arts,"</Q> &s;ays he,

His comedies were found after his death in a che&s;t, where they had been long mi&s;&s;ing and much regretted; we have to the amount of fourteen of their titles, and are further informed that he was &s;o excellent an actor, that it became a proverb of honour to pronounce upon any capital performer, that <HI>He played in the &s;tile of Nico&s;tra|tus.</HI> It is with regret I di&s;cover nothing in the few &s;mall fragments of this eminent author and actor worth tran&s;lating; however, that I may not pa&s;s over his remains without the grateful cere|mony of be&s;towing one &s;mall tribute to his me|mory, I have rendered this &s;hort epigrammatic di&s;tich into our language&mdash;

The talents of the greate&s;t actor at be&s;t can &s;urvive him by tradition only, but when Nature to tho&s;e rare attributes adds the gift of a poetic genius, it gives a double poignancy to our re|gret, that time &s;hould not have left a relique even of the&s;e more con&s;iderable than the above.</P>

<P>We are beholden to this poet for a very plea|&s;ant narrative made by a lady of ea&s;y virtue, in which &s;he de&s;cribes certain of her keepers with a great deal of comic humour, and it is humour of a &s;ort, that has not evaporated by the intervention of twenty centuries; &s;he was tired of her trade, and therefore, though the theme be a loo&s;e one, the moral of it is good: The lady is in conver&s;ation with a man named Pythias, but whether the friend of Damon the Pythagorean, or &s;ome other, does not appear: The noble profe&s;&s;ions of arms, phy&s;ic, and philo&s;ophy had taken their turns in her good graces, but for the credit they gained by the account, I think it is pretty equally divided among&s;t them&mdash;

<P>Let us call to mind the inau&s;picious com|mencement of this monarch's reign; before the ceremony of his coronation had taken place, he e&s;pou&s;ed a &s;i&s;ter of France and &s;et a catholic prince&s;s on the throne of a prote&s;tant kingdom, &s;carce cool from the ferment of religious jea|lou&s;ies, recently emancipated from the yoke of Rome and of cour&s;e intolerant through terror, if not by principle: The mo&s;t obnoxious man in

the kingdom was Montagu, author of the pro|&s;cribed tract, intitled <HI>Apello Cae&s;arem,</HI> and him Charles enrolled in his li&s;t of royal chaplains: By throwing him&s;elf incontinently into the hands of Buckingham he &s;hewed his people they were to expect a reign of favoriti&s;m, and the choice of the mini&s;ter marked the character of the mo|narch: He levied mu&s;ters for the Palatinate of twelve thou&s;and men, exacted contributions for coat and conduct-money, declared martial law in the kingdom and furni&s;hed his brother of France with a &s;quadron of &s;hips for the un|popular reduction of Rochelle, and the mariners refu&s;ed the &s;ervice: The&s;e mea&s;ures &s;tirred the parliament then &s;itting to move for a redre&s;s of grievances, before they provided for his debts, and their remon&s;trances provoked him upon the in&s;tant to di&s;&s;olve them.</P>
<P>Every one of the&s;e proceedings took place before his coronation, and form the melancholy prelude to his mi&s;guided government.</P>
<P>A &s;econd parliament was called together, and to intimidate them from re&s;uming their redre&s;s of grievances and divert their attempts from the per&s;on of his favorite, he haughtily informs them, <HI>that he cannot &s;uffer an enquiry even on the meane&s;t of his &s;ervants.</HI> What was to be expected from &s;uch a menacing declaration?

<P>A third parliament meets, and in the interim new grievances of a more awakening &s;ort had &s;upplied them with an ample field for complaint and remon&s;trance; in the intermi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ittings, he had exacted a loan, which they in|terpreted a tax without parliament, and of cour&s;e a flagrant violation of the con&s;titution; this he enforced with &s;o high a hand, that &s;everal gen|tlemen of name in their counties had been com|mitted to clo&s;e impri&s;onment for refu&s;ing pay|ment; &s;hip-money al&s;o at this time began to be que&s;tioned as an intolerable grievance, and being one of the re&s;ources for enabling the crown to govern without a parliament, it was con&s;idered by many as a violation of their rights, an in|equitable and oppre&s;&s;ive tax, which ought to be re&s;i&s;ted, and accordingly it was re&s;i&s;ted: This parliament therefore after a &s;hort and inefficient &s;itting &s;hared the &s;udden fate of it's predece&s;&s;ors.</P>

<P>The troubles in Scotland made it nece&s;&s;ary for the king once more to have re&s;ort to a par|liament; they met for the fourth time on the thirteenth of April 1640, and the fifth day of the following month &s;ent them back to their con&s;ti|tuents to tell tho&s;e grievances in the ears of the people, which their &s;overeign di&s;dained to li&s;ten to.

In this fatal moment the fuel was prepared and the match lighted, to give life to the flames of civil war; already Scotland had &s;et tho&s;e &s;parks into a blaze; the king unable to extingui&s;h the conflagration by his own power and re&s;ources, for the fifth and la&s;t time con|venes his parliament; but it was now too late for any confidence or mutual harmony to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the crown and commons; on the third of November following their la&s;t di&s;&s;olution

<P>If there is a tru&s;t in life, which calls upon the con&s;cience of the man who undertakes it more &s;trongly than any other, it is that of the edu|cation of an heir-apparent to a crown: The training &s;uch a pupil is a ta&s;k indeed; how to open his mind to a proper knowledge of man|kind without letting in that knowledge, which inclines to evil; how to hold off flattery and yet admit familiarity; how to give the lights of in|formation and &s;hut out the fal&s;e colours of &s;e|duction, demands a judgment for di&s;tingui&s;hing and an authority for controuling, which few go|vernors in that delicate &s;ituation ever po&s;&s;e&s;s, or can long retain: To educate a prince, born to reign over an enlightened people, upon the nar|row &s;cale of &s;ecret and &s;eque&s;tered tuition, would be an abu&s;e of common &s;en&s;e; to let him loo&s;e upon the world is no le&s;s hazardous in the other extreme, and each would probably devote him to an inglorious de&s;tiny: That he &s;hould

know the leading characters in the country he is to govern, be familiar with it's hi&s;tory, it's con|&s;titution, manners, laws and liberties, and cor|rectly comprehend the duties and di&s;tinctions of his own hereditary office, are points that no one will di&s;pute: That he &s;hould travel through his kingdom I can hardly doubt, but whether tho&s;e excur&s;ions &s;hould reach into other &s;tates, politi|cally connected with, or oppo&s;ed to, his own, is more than I will pre&s;ume to lay down as a ge|neral rule, being aware that it mu&s;t depend upon per&s;onal circum&s;tances: Splendor he may be in|dulged in, but exce&s;s in that, as in every thing el&s;e, mu&s;t be avoided, for the mi&s;chiefs cannot be numbered, which it will entail upon him; exce&s;s in expence will &s;ubject him to obligations of a degrading &s;ort; exce&s;s in courte&s;y will lay him open to the forward and a&s;&s;uming, rai&s;e mountains of expectation about him, and all of them undermined by di&s;appointment, ready charged for explo&s;ion, when the hand of pre|&s;umption &s;hall &s;et fire to the train: Exce&s;s in plea&s;ure will lower him in character, de&s;troy health, re&s;pect, and that becoming dignity of mind, that con&s;cious rectitude, which is to direct and &s;upport him, when he becomes the di&s;pen&s;er of ju&s;tice to his &s;ubjects, the protector and de|fender of their religion, the model for their imi|tation

and the &s;overeign arbiter of life and death in the execution of every legal condemnation: To court popularity is both derogatory and dan|gerous, nor &s;hould he, who is de&s;tined to rule over the whole, conde&s;cend to put him&s;elf in the league of a party: To be a protector of learn|ing and a patron of the arts, is worthy of a prince, but let him beware how he &s;inks him|&s;elf into a pedant or a virtuo&s;o: It is a mean talent, which excels in trifles; the fine arts are more likely to flouri&s;h under a prince, who&s;e ignorance of them is qualified by general and impartial good-will towards their profe&s;&s;ors, than by one, who is him&s;elf a dabbler; for &s;uch will always have their favorites, and favoriti&s;m never fails to irritate the minds of men of genius con|cerned in the &s;ame &s;tudies, and turns the &s;pirit of emulation into the gall of acrimony.</P>
<P>Above all things let it be his inviolable maxim to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;trongly and pointedly in his at|tentions between men of virtuous morals and men of vicious: There is nothing &s;o glorious and at the &s;ame time nothing &s;o ea&s;y; if his countenance is turned to men of principle and character, if he be&s;tows his &s;mile upon the worthy only, he need be at little pains to frown upon the profligate, all &s;uch vermin will crawl out of his path and &s;hrink away from his pre|&s;ence:
<PB N="135" REF="142">
Glittering talents will be no pa&s;&s;port for di&s;&s;olute morals, and ambition will then be re|tained in no other cau&s;e, but that of virtue; men will not chu&s;e crooked pa&s;&s;ages and bye-alleys to preferment, when the broad highway of hone&s;ty is laid open and &s;trait before them. A prince, though he gives a good example in his own per&s;on, what does he profit the world, if he draws it back again by the bad examples of tho&s;e, whom he employs and favors? Better might it be for a nation, to &s;ee a libertine on it's throne &s;urrounded by virtuous coun&s;ellors, than to contemplate a virtuous &s;overeign, delegating his authority to unprincipled and licentious &s;ervants.</P>
<P>The king, who declares his re&s;olution of countenancing the virtuous only among&s;t his &s;ubjects, &s;peaks the language of an hone&s;t man; if he makes good his declaration, he performs the functions of one, and earns the ble&s;&s;ings of a righteous king; a life of glory in this world, and an immortality of happine&s;s in the world to come.</P>

<P>Many ingenious ob&s;ervations have been given to the public upon Shake&s;pear's <HI>Imaginary Be|ings</HI>; his Caliban, Ariel and all his family of witches, gho&s;ts and fairies have been referred to as examples of his creative fancy, and with rea&s;on has his &s;uperiority been a&s;&s;erted in the fa|brication of the&s;e praeternatural machines, and as to the art, with which he has woven them into the fables of his dramas, and the incidents he has produced by their agency, he is in the&s;e particulars &s;till more indi&s;putably unrivalled; the language he has given to Caliban, and no le&s;s characteri&s;tically to his Ariel, is &s;o original, &s;o inimitable, that it is more like magic than in|vention, and his fairy poetry is as happy as it can be: It were a je&s;t to compare Ae&s;chylus's gho&s;t of Darius, or any gho&s;t that ever walked with the <HI>perturbed &s;pirit</HI> of Hamlet: Great and merited encomiums have al&s;o been pa&s;&s;ed upon the <HI>weird &s;i&s;ters</HI> in that wonderful drama, and a decided preference given them over the famous <HI>Erichtho</HI> of Lucan: Preferable they doubtle&s;s are, if we contemplate them in their dramatic characters, and take into our account the grand and awful commi&s;&s;ion, which they bear in that &s;cene of tragic terror; but of their poetical &s;u|periority,
<PB N="141" REF="148">
&s;imply con&s;idered, I have &s;ome doubts; let me add to this, that when the learned com|mentator was in&s;tancing Lucan's Erichtho, it is matter of &s;ome wonder with me, how he came to overlook Jon&s;on's witches in the <HI>Ma&s;que of the Queens.</HI></P>

<Q>U&s;us vetu&s;to genere, &s;ed rebus novis.
<BIBL>PROLOG. PHAED. FAB. lib. v.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BEN JONSON in his prologue to the comedy of <HI>The Fox</HI> &s;ays that he wrote it in the &s;hort &s;pace of five weeks, his words are&mdash;
<Q><L>To the&s;e there needs no lie but this his creature,</L>
<L>Which was two months &s;ince no feature;</L>
<L>And tho' he dares give them five lives to mend it,</L>
<L>'Tis known five weeks fully penn'd it.</L></Q>
This he delivers in his u&s;ual vaunting &s;tile, &s;purning at the critics and detractors of his day, who thought to convict him of dulne&s;s by te&s;ti|fying in fact to his diligence. The magic
<PB N="148" REF="155">
movements of Shake&s;pear's mu&s;e had been &s;o noted and applauded for their &s;urpri&s;ing ra|pidity, that the public had contracted a very ri|diculous re&s;pect for ha&s;ty productions in general, and thought there could be no better te&s;t of a poet's genius than the di&s;patch and facility with which he wrote; Jon&s;on therefore affects to mark his contempt of the public judgment for applauding ha&s;ty writers in the couplet preceding tho&s;e above quoted&mdash;
<Q><L>And when his plays come out, think they can flout 'em</L>
<L>With &s;aying, He was a year about them.</L></Q>
But at the &s;ame time that he &s;hews this con|tempt very ju&s;tly, he certainly betrays a degree of weakne&s;s in boa&s;ting of his poetical di&s;patch, and &s;eems to forget that he had noted Shake&s;pear with &s;omething le&s;s than friendly cen&s;ure for the very quality, he is vaunting him&s;elf upon.</P>
<P>Several comic poets &s;ince his age have &s;eemed to pride them&s;elves on the little time they ex|pended on their productions; &s;ome have had the artifice to hook it in as an excu&s;e for their er|rors, but it is no le&s;s evident what &s;hare vanity has in all &s;uch apologies: Wycherley is an in|&s;tance among&s;t the&s;e, and Congreve tells of his expedition in writing the <HI>Old Bachelor,</HI> yet the &s;ame man afterwards in his letter to Mr. Dryden
<PB N="149" REF="156">
pompou&s;ly pronounces that to write one perfect comedy &s;hould be the labour of one entire life produced from a concentration of talents, which hardly ever met in any human per&s;on.</P>
<P>After all it will be confe&s;&s;ed that the pro|duction of &s;uch a drama as <HI>The Fox</HI> in the &s;pace of five weeks is a very wonderful performance; for it mu&s;t on all hands be con&s;idered as the ma&s;ter-piece of a very capital arti&s;t, a work, that bears the &s;tamp of elaborate de&s;ign, a &s;trong and frequently a &s;ublime vein of poetry, much &s;ter|ling wit, comic humour, happy character, moral &s;atire and unrivalled erudition; a work&mdash;
<Q><L>Quod non imber edax, non aquilo impotens</L>
<L>Po&s;&s;it diruere, aut innumerabilis</L>
<L>Annorum &s;eries et fuga temporum.</L></Q></P>
<P>In this drama the learned reader will find him|&s;elf for ever treading upon cla&s;&s;ic ground; the foot of the poet is &s;o fitted and familiarized to the Grecian &s;ock, that he wears it not with the awkwardne&s;s of an imitator, but with all the ea&s;y confidence and authoritative air of a privi|leged Athenian: Exclu&s;ive of Ari&s;tophanes, in who&s;e volume he is perfect, it is plain that even the gleanings and broken fragments of the Greek &s;tage had not e&s;caped him; in the very fir&s;t &s;peech of Volpone's, which opens the co|medy,
<PB N="150" REF="157">
and in which he rapturou&s;ly addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to his trea&s;ure, he is to be traced mo&s;t decidedly in the fragments of Menander, Sopho|cles and Euripides, in Theognis and in He&s;iod, not to mention Horace. To follow him through every one would be tedious, and therefore I will give a &s;ample of one pa&s;&s;age only; Volpone is &s;peaking to his gold&mdash;
<Q><SP>
<L>Thou being the be&s;t of things and far tran&s;cending</L>
<L>All &s;tile of joy in children, parents, friends&mdash;</L>

<L>They &s;hould have given her twenty thou&s;and Cupids,</L>
<L>Such are thy beauties and our loves&mdash;</L>

<P>Cicero made a &s;election of pa&s;&s;ages from the Greek dramatic authors, which he turned into Latin ver&s;e for the purpo&s;e of applying them, as occa&s;ion &s;hould offer, either in his writings or pleadings, and our learned countryman &s;eems on his part to have made the whole circle of Greek
<PB N="151" REF="158">
and Roman poets his own and naturalized them to our &s;tage. If any learned man would em|ploy his lei&s;ure in following his allu&s;ions through this comedy only, I &s;hould think it would be no unentertaining ta&s;k.</P>
<P><HI>The Fox</HI> is indubitably the be&s;t production of it's author, and in &s;ome points of &s;ub&s;tantial merit yields to nothing, which the Engli&s;h &s;tage can oppo&s;e to it; there is a bold and happy &s;pirit in the fable, it is of moral tendency, female cha&s;tity and honour are beautifully di&s;played and puni&s;hment is inflicted on the delinquents of the drama with &s;trict and exemplary ju&s;tice: The characters of the <HI>Haeredipetae,</HI> depicted under the titles of birds of prey, <HI>Voltore, Corbacoio</HI> and <HI>Corvino,</HI> are warmly coloured, happily con|tra&s;ted and faithfully &s;upported from the out&s;et to the end: <HI>Volpone,</HI> who gives his name to the piece, with a fox-like craftine&s;s deludes and gulls their hopes by the agency of his inimitable Para&s;ite, or (as the Greek and Roman authors expre&s;&s;ed it) by his <HI>Fly,</HI> his <HI>Mo&s;ca</HI>; and in this fini&s;hed portrait Jon&s;on may throw the gauntlet to the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of antiquity; the cha|racter is of cla&s;&s;ic origin; it is found with the contemporaries of Ari&s;tophanes, though not in any comedy of his now exi&s;ting; the Middle Dramati&s;ts &s;eem to have handled it very fre|quently,
<PB N="152" REF="159">
and in the New Comedy it rarely failed to find a place; Plautus has it again and again, but the aggregate merit of all his Para&s;ites will not weigh in the &s;cale again&s;t this &s;ingle <HI>Fly</HI> of our poet: The incident of his concealing <HI>Bonario</HI> in the gallery, from whence he breaks in upon the &s;cene to the re&s;cue of Celia and the detection of <HI>Volpone,</HI> is one of the happie&s;t contrivances, which could po&s;&s;ibly be devi&s;ed, becau&s;e at the &s;ame time that it produces the cata&s;trophe, it does not &s;acrifice <HI>Mo&s;ca's</HI> character in the man|ner mo&s;t villains are &s;acrificed in comedy by making them commit blunders, which do not corre&s;pond with the addre&s;s their fir&s;t repre&s;en|tation exhibits and which the audience has a right to expect from them throughout, of which the <HI>Double Dealer</HI> is among&s;t others a notable in&s;tance. But this incident of <HI>Bonario</HI>'s inter|ference does not only not impeach the adroitne&s;s of the Para&s;ite, but it furni&s;hes a very brilliant occa&s;ion for &s;etting off his ready invention and pre&s;ence of mind in a new and &s;uperior light, and &s;erves to introduce the whole machinery of the trial and condemnation of the innocent per|&s;ons before the court of <HI>Advocates:</HI> In this part of the &s;able the contrivance is inimitable, and here the poet's art is a &s;tudy, which every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">otari&s;t of the dramatic mu&s;es ought to pay at|tention
<PB N="153" REF="160">
and re&s;pect to; had the &s;ame addre&s;s been exerted throughout, the con&s;truction would have been a matchle&s;s piece of art, but here we are to lament the ha&s;te of which he boa&s;ts in his prologue, and that rapidity of compo&s;ition, which he appeals to as a mark of genius, is to be la|mented as the probable cau&s;e of incorrectne&s;s, or at lea&s;t the be&s;t and mo&s;t candid plea in ex|cu&s;e of it: For who can deny that nature is vio|lated by the ab&s;urdity of <HI>Volpone</HI>'s un&s;ea&s;onable in&s;ults to the very per&s;ons, who had witne&s;&s;ed fal&s;ely in his defence, and even to the very <HI>Ad|vocate,</HI> who had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully defended him? Is it in character for a man of his deep cunning and long reach of thought to provoke tho&s;e, on whom his all depended, to retaliate upon him, and this for the poor triumph of a &s;illy je&s;t? Certainly this is a glaring defect, which every body mu&s;t lament, and which can e&s;cape no|body. The poet him&s;elf knew the weak part of his plot and vainly &s;trives to bol&s;ter it up by making <HI>Volpone</HI> exclaim again&s;t his own folly&mdash;

<P>The judgment pronounced upon the criminals in the conclu&s;ion of the play is &s;o ju&s;t and &s;olemn, that I mu&s;t think the poet has made a wanton breach of character and gained but a &s;orry je&s;t by the bargain, when he violates the dignity of his court of judges by making one of them &s;o abject in his flattery to the Para&s;ite upon the idea of matching him with his daugh|ter, when he hears that Volpone has made him his heir; but this is an objection, that lies

<P>It does not occur to me that any other remark is left for me to make upon this celebrated drama, that could convey the &s;lighte&s;t cen&s;ure; but very many might be made in the highe&s;t &s;train of commendation, if there was need of any more than general te&s;timony to &s;uch ac|knowledged merit. <HI>The Fox</HI> is a drama of &s;o peculiar a &s;pecies, that it cannot be dragged into a compari&s;on with the production of any other modern poet what&s;oever; it's con&s;truction is &s;o di&s;&s;imilar from any thing of Shake&s;pear's writing, that it would be going greatly out of our way, and a very gro&s;s abu&s;e of critici&s;m to attempt to &s;ettle the relative degrees of merit, where the characters of the writers are &s;o widely oppo&s;ite: In one we may re&s;pect the profundity of learn|ing, in the other we mu&s;t admire the &s;ublimity of genius; to one we pay the tribute of under|&s;tanding, to the other we &s;urrender up the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of our hearts; Shake&s;pear with ten thou|&s;and &s;pots about him dazzles us with &s;o bright a

<HEAD>N^o CXI.</HEAD>
<P>IN my foregoing paper when I remarked that Jon&s;on in his comedy of <HI>The Fox</HI> was a clo&s;e copier of the antients, it occurred to me to &s;ay &s;omething upon the celebrated drama of <HI>The Samp&s;on Agoni&s;tes,</HI> which, though le&s;s beholden to the Greek poets in it's dialogue than the co|medy above-mentioned, is in all other particulars as compleat an imitation of the Antient Tra|gedy, as the di&s;tance of times and the difference of languages will admit of.</P>
<P>It is profe&s;&s;edly <HI>built according to antient rule and example,</HI> and the author by taking Ari&s;totle's definition of tragedy for his motto, fairly chal|lenges the critic to examine and compare it by that te&s;t. His clo&s;e adherence to the model of the Greek tragedy is in nothing more con|&s;picuous than in the &s;implicity of his diction; in this particular he has curbed his fancy with &s;o tight a hand, that, knowing as we do the fertile vein of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">is genius, we cannot but lament the fidelity of his imitation; for there is a har&s;hne&s;s in the metre of his Chorus, which to a certain
<PB N="158" REF="165">
degree &s;eems to border upon pedantry and af|fectation; he premi&s;es that <HI>the mea&s;ure is indeed of all &s;orts,</HI> but I mu&s;t take leave to ob&s;erve that in &s;ome places it is no mea&s;ure at all, or &s;uch at lea&s;t as the ear will not patiently endure, nor which any recitation can make harmonious. By ca&s;ting out of his compo&s;ition the &s;trophe and anti&s;trophe, tho&s;e &s;tanzas which the Greeks ap|propriated to &s;inging, or in one word by making his Chorus mono&s;trophic, he has robbed it of that lyric beauty, which he was capable of be|&s;towing in the highe&s;t perfection; and why he &s;hould &s;top &s;hort in this particular, when he had otherwi&s;e gone &s;o far in imitation, is not ea&s;y to gue&s;s; for &s;urely it would have been quite as natural to &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e &s;tanzas, had he written any, might be &s;ung, as that all the other parts, as the drama now &s;tands with a Chorus of &s;uch irregular mea&s;ure, might be recited or given in repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Now it is well known to every man con|ver&s;ant in the Greek theatre, how the Chorus, which in fact is the parent of the drama, came in proce&s;s of improvement to be woven into the fable, and from being at fir&s;t the whole grew in time to be only a part: The fable being &s;imple, and the characters few, the &s;triking part of the &s;pectacle re&s;ted upon the &s;inging and dancing of
<PB N="159" REF="166">
the interlude, if I may &s;o call it, and to the&s;e the people were too long accu&s;tomed and too warmly attached, to allow of any reform for their exclu&s;ion; the tragic poet therefore never got rid of his Chorus, though the writers of the Middle Comedy contrived to di&s;mi&s;s their's, and probably their fable being of a more lively character, their &s;cenes were better able to &s;tand without the &s;upport of mu&s;ic and &s;pectacle, than the mournful fable and more languid recitation of the tragedians. That the tragic authors la|boured again&s;t the Chorus will appear from their efforts to expel Bacchus and his Satyrs from the &s;tage, in which they were long time oppo&s;ed by the audience, and at la&s;t by certain ingenious expedients, which were a kind of compromi&s;e with the public, effected their point: This in part was brought about by the introduction of a fuller &s;cene and a more active fable, but the Chorus with it's accompaniments kept it's place, and the poet, who &s;eldom ventured upon intro|ducing more than three &s;peakers on the &s;cene at the &s;ame time, qualified the &s;terility of his bu&s;i|ne&s;s by giving to the Chorus a &s;hare of the dia|logue, who at the &s;ame time that they furni&s;hed the &s;tage with numbers, were not counted among&s;t the &s;peaking characters according to the rigour of the u&s;age above-mentioned. A
<PB N="160" REF="167">
man mu&s;t be an enthu&s;ia&s;t for antiquity, who can find charms in the dialogue-part of a Greek Chorus, and reconcile him&s;elf to their unnatural and chilling interruptions of the action and pa|thos of the &s;cene: I am fully per&s;uaded they came there upon motives of expediency only, and kept their po&s;t upon the plea of long po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the attractions of &s;pectacle and mu&s;ic: In &s;hort nature was &s;acrificed to the di&s;|play of art, and the heart gave up it's feelings that the ear and eye might be gratified.</P>
<P>When Milton therefore takes the Chorus into his dialogue, excluding from his drama the lyric &s;trophe and anti&s;trophe, he rejects what I con|ceive to be it's only recommendation, and which an elegant contemporary in his imi|tations of the Greek tragedy is more properly attentive to; at the &s;ame time it cannot be de|nied that Milton's Chorus &s;ub&s;cribes more to the dialogues, and harmonizes better with the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the &s;cene, than that of any Greek tra|gedy we can now refer to.</P>
<P>I would now proceed to a review of the per|formance it&s;elf, if it were not a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, which the author of <HI>The Rambler</HI> has very ably pre|vented me in; re&s;pect however to an authority &s;o high in critici&s;m mu&s;t not prevent me from ob&s;erving, that, when he &s;ays&mdash;<HI>This is the tra|gedy,</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="168">
<HI>which ignorance has admired and bigotry ap|plauded,</HI> he makes it meritorious in any future critic to attempt at following him over the ground he has trode, for the purpo&s;e of di&s;co|vering what tho&s;e blemi&s;hes are, which he has found out by &s;uperior &s;agacity, and which others have &s;o palpably overlooked, as to merit the di&s;|graceful character of <HI>ignorance and bigotry.</HI></P>
<P>The principal, and in effect the only, ob|jection, which he &s;tates, is that <HI>the poem wants a middle, &s;ince nothing pa&s;&s;es between the fir&s;t act and the la&s;t, that either ha&s;tens or delays the death of Samp&s;on.</HI> This demands examination: The death of Samp&s;on I need not de&s;cribe; it is a &s;udden, momentary event; what can ha&s;ten or delay it, but the will of the per&s;on, who by an exertion of miraculous &s;trength was to bury him&s;elf under the ruins of a &s;tructure, in which his enemies were a&s;&s;embled? To determine that will depends upon the impul&s;e of his own &s;pirit, or it may be upon the in&s;piration of Hea|ven: If there are any incidents in the body of the drama, which lead to this determination, and indicate an impul&s;e, either natural or praeter-natural, &s;uch mu&s;t be called leading incidents, and tho&s;e leading incidents will con&s;titute a middle, or in more diffu&s;ive terms the middle bu&s;ine&s;s of the drama. Manoah in his inter|view
<PB N="162" REF="169">
with Samp&s;on, which the author of the Rambler denominates the &s;econd act of the tra|gedy, tells him
<Q><SP>
<L>This day the Phili&s;tines a popular fea&s;t</L>
<L>Here celebrate in Gaza, and proclaim</L>
<L>Great pomp and &s;acrifice and prai&s;es loud</L>
<L>To Dagon, as their God&mdash;</L>
</SP></Q>
Here is information of a meeting of his enemies to celebrate their idolatrous triumphs; an inci|dent of ju&s;t provocation to the &s;ervant of the living God, an opportunity perhaps for ven|geance, either human or divine; if it pa&s;&s;es without notice from Samp&s;on, it is not to be &s;tiled an incident, if on the contrary he remarks upon it, it mu&s;t be one&mdash;but Samp&s;on replies
<Q><SP>
<L>Dagon mu&s;t &s;toop, and &s;hall ere long receive</L>
<L>Such a di&s;comfit, as &s;hall quite de&s;poil him</L>
<L>Of all the&s;e boa&s;ted trophies won on me,</L>
<L>And with confu&s;ion blank his wor&s;hippers.</L>
</SP></Q>
Who will &s;ay the expectation is not here pre|pared for &s;ome cata&s;trophe, we know not what, but awful it mu&s;t be, for it is Samp&s;on which denounces the downfal of the idol, it is God who in&s;pires the denunciation; the cri&s;is is im|portant, for it is that which &s;hall decide whether God or Dagon is to triumph, it is in the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;<HI>dignus vindice</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="170">
<HI>nodus</HI>&mdash;and therefore we may boldly pronounce <HI>Deus inter&s;it!</HI></P>
<P>That this interpretation meets the &s;en&s;e of the author is clear from the remark of Manoah, who is made to &s;ay that <HI>he receives the&s;e words as a prophecy.</HI> Prophetic they are, and were meant to be by the poet, who in this u&s;e of his &s;acred prophecy imitates the heathen oracles, on which &s;everal of their dramatic plots are con&s;tructed, as might be &s;hewn by obvious examples. The interview with Manoah then is conducive to the cata&s;trophe, and the drama is not in this &s;cene devoid of incident.</P>
<P>Dalilah next appears, and if whatever tends to rai&s;e our intere&s;t in the leading character of the tragedy, cannot rightly be called epi&s;odical, the introduction of this per&s;on ought not to be accounted &s;uch, for who but this per&s;on is the cau&s;e and origin of all the pathos and di&s;tre&s;s of the &s;tory? The dialogue of this &s;cene is moral, affecting and &s;ublime; it is al&s;o &s;trictly cha|racteri&s;tic.</P>
<P>The next &s;cene exhibits the tremendous giant Harapha, and the contra&s;t thereby produced is among&s;t the beauties of the poem, and may of it&s;elf be termed an important incident: That it leads to the cata&s;trophe I think will not be di&s;|puted,
<PB N="164" REF="171">
and if it is a&s;ked in what manner, the Chorus will &s;upply us with an an&s;wer&mdash;
<Q><SP>
<L>He will directly to the Lords I fear,</L>
<L>And with malicious coun&s;el &s;tir them up</L>
<L>Some way or other further to afflict thee.</L>
</SP></Q>
Here is another prediction connected with the plot and verified by it's cata&s;trophe, for Samp|&s;on is commanded to come to the fe&s;tival and entertain the revellers with &s;ome feats of &s;trength: The&s;e commands he re&s;i&s;ts, but obeys an impul&s;e of his mind by going afterwards and thereby fulfils the prophetic declaration he had made to his father in the &s;econd act. What in|cident can &s;hew more management and addre&s;s in the poet, than this of Samp&s;on's refu&s;ing the &s;ummons of the idolaters and obeying the vi&s;i|tation of God's &s;pirit.</P>
<P>And now I may confidently appeal to the ju|dicious reader, whether the <HI>Samp&s;on Agoni&s;tes</HI> is &s;o void of incident between the opening and conclu&s;ion as fairly to be pronounced <HI>to want a middle.</HI> Simple it is from fir&s;t to la&s;t, &s;imple perhaps to a degree of coldne&s;s in &s;ome of it's parts, but to &s;ay that nothing pa&s;&s;es between the fir&s;t act and the la&s;t, <HI>which ha&s;tens or delays the death of Samp&s;on,</HI> is not correct, becau&s;e the very
<PB N="165" REF="172">
incidents are to be found, which conduce to the cata&s;trophe, and but for which it could not have come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The author of the Rambler profe&s;&s;es to ex|amine <HI>The Samp&s;on Agoni&s;tes</HI> according to the rule laid down by Ari&s;totle for the di&s;po&s;ition and perfection of a tragedy, and this rule he in|forms us is that it &s;hould have <HI>a beginning, a middle, and an end.</HI> And is this the mighty purpo&s;e for which the authority of Ari&s;totle is appealed to? If it be thus the author of the Rambler has read <HI>The Poetics,</HI> and this be the be&s;t rule he can collect from that treati&s;e, I am afraid he will find it too &s;hort a mea&s;ure for the poet he is examining, or the critic he is quoting. Ari&s;totle had &s;aid <HI>that every whole hath not am|plitude enough for the con&s;truction of a tragic fable; now by a whole,</HI> (adds he in the way of illu&s;tra|tion) <HI>I mean that, which hath beginning, middle and end.</HI> This and no more is what he &s;ays upon beginning, middle and end; and this, which the author of the Rambler conceives to be a rule for tragedy, turns out to be merely an explanation of the word <HI>whole,</HI> which is only one term among&s;t many employed by the critic in his profe&s;&s;ed and compleat definition of tragedy. I &s;hould add that Ari&s;totle gives a further ex|planation of the terms, beginning, middle and
<PB N="166" REF="173">
end, which the author of the Rambler hath turned into Engli&s;h, but in &s;o doing he hath in|excu&s;ably turned them out of their original &s;en&s;e as well as language; as any curious critic may be convinced of, who compares them with Ari&s;totle's words in the eighth chapter of the <HI>Poetics.</HI></P>
<P>Of the poetic diction of <HI>The Samp&s;on Agoni&s;tes</HI> I have already &s;poken in general; to particu|larize pa&s;&s;ages of &s;triking beauty would draw me into too great length; at the &s;ame time, not to pa&s;s over &s;o plea&s;ing a part of my undertaking in ab&s;olute &s;ilence, I will give the following reply of Samp&s;on to the Chorus&mdash;
<Q><SP>
<L>Wherever fountain or fre&s;h current flow'd</L>
<L>Again&s;t the ea&s;tern ray, tran&s;lucent, pure</L>
<L>With touch ethereal of heaven's fiery rod,</L>
<L>I drank, from the clear milky juice allaying</L>
<L>Thir&s;t, and refre&s;h'd; nor envy'd them the grape,</L>
<L>Who&s;e heads that turbulent liquor fills with fumes.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>Of the character I may &s;ay in few words, that Samp&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the terrific maje&s;ty of <HI>Pro|metheus chained,</HI> the my&s;terious di&s;tre&s;s of <HI>Oedi|pus</HI> and the pitiable wretchedne&s;s of <HI>Philoctetes.</HI> His properties, like tho&s;e of the fir&s;t, are &s;ome|thing above human; his misfortunes, like tho&s;e of the &s;econd, are derivable from the di&s;plea&s;ure of heaven and involved in oracles; his condition,
<PB N="167" REF="174">
like that of the la&s;t, is the mo&s;t abject, which human nature can be reduced to from a &s;tate of dignity and &s;plendor.</P>
<P>Of the cata&s;trophe there remains only to re|mark, that it is of unparalleled maje&s;ty and terror.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF I am rightly advi&s;ed, the laws of England have provided no remedy for an injury, which I have received from a certain gentle|man, who &s;ets me at defiance, and whom I am not con&s;cious of having offended in the &s;malle&s;t article in life. My ca&s;e is as follows: Some time ago I went into the South of France for the recovery of my health, which (thank God) I have &s;o far effected, that I &s;hould think I was
<PB N="168" REF="175">
at this very moment enjoying as good a &s;tock of &s;pirits and &s;trength, as I have enjoyed for many years of my life pa&s;t, if I was not outfaced by the gentleman in que&s;tion, who &s;wears I am dead, and has proceeded &s;o far as to publi&s;h me dead to all the world with a whole volume of memoirs, which I have no remembrance of, and of &s;ayings, which I never &s;aid.</P>
<P>I think this is very hard upon me, and if there is no redre&s;s for &s;uch proceedings, but that a man mu&s;t be printed dead, whenever any fanci|ful fellow chu&s;es to write a book of memoirs, I mu&s;t take the freedom to &s;ay this is no country to live in; and let my ingenious biographer take it how he will, I &s;hall &s;till maintain to his face that I am alive, and I do not &s;ee why my word in &s;uch a ca&s;e &s;hould not go as far as his.</P>
<P>There is yet another thing I will venture to &s;ay, that I did never in the whole cour&s;e of my life utter one half or even one tenth part of the &s;mart repartees and bon-mots he is plea&s;ed to impute to me: I don't know what he means by laying &s;uch things at my door; I defy any one of my acquaintance to &s;ay I was a wit, which I always con&s;idered as another name for an ill-tempered fellow. I do acknowledge that I have lived upon terms of acquaintance with my biographer, and have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;ocial hours
<PB N="169" REF="176">
in his company, but I never &s;u&s;pected he was minuting down every fooli&s;h thing, that e&s;caped my lips in the unguarded moments of convivial gaiety; if I had, I would have avoided him like the pe&s;tilence. It is hard upon a man, let me tell you, Sir, very hard indeed to find his follies upon record, and I could almo&s;t wi&s;h his words were true, and that I were dead in earne&s;t, ra|ther than alive to read &s;uch non&s;en&s;e, and find my&s;elf made the father of it.</P>
<P>Judge of my &s;urpri&s;e, when pa&s;&s;ing along Vigo-lane upon a friendly call, as I intended it, to this very gentleman, of whom I complain, I took up a volume from a &s;tall in a whitey-brown paper binding, and opening it at the title-page met my own face, &s;taring me out of counte|nance full in the front: I &s;tarted back with hor|ror; nature never gave me any rea&s;on to be fond of my own features; I never &s;urvey my face but when I &s;have my&s;elf, and then I am a&s;hamed of it; I tru&s;t it is no true type of my heart, for it is a &s;orry &s;ample of nature's handy|work, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it. What the devil tempted him to &s;tick it there I cannot gue&s;s, any more than I can at his publi&s;hing a bundle of non&s;en&s;ical &s;ayings and doings, which I dete&s;t and di&s;avow. As for his printing my la&s;t will and te&s;tament, and di&s;po&s;ing of my poor per|&s;onals
<PB N="170" REF="177">
at plea&s;ure, I care little about it; if he had taken only my money and &s;pared my life, I would not have complained.</P>
<P>And now what is my redre&s;s? I apply my|&s;elf to you in my di&s;tre&s;s as an author, who&s;e book is in pretty general circulation, and one, as I perceive, who a&s;&s;aults no man's living fame and character; I de&s;ire therefore you will take mine into your protection, and if you can think of any thing to deter the world in future from &s;uch flippancies, you are welcome to make what u&s;e you plea&s;e of this letter; for as I have always &s;trove to do what little &s;ervice I could to the living, when I was allowed to be one of their number, &s;o now I am voted out of their com|pany, I would gladly be of &s;ome u&s;e to the dead.</P>

<P>I am in the habit of committing to paper every thing of this &s;ort, whether it is of my own &s;aying, or any other per&s;on's, when I am con|vinced I my&s;elf &s;hould have &s;aid it, if he had not: The&s;e I call my con&s;cientious wittici&s;ms, and give them a leaf in my common-place book to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I have the plea&s;ure to tell you that my col|lection is now become not only con&s;iderable in bulk, but, (that I may &s;peak humbly of it's me|rit) I will al&s;o &s;ay, that it is to the full as good, and far more creditable to any gentleman's cha|racter, than the books, which have been pub|li&s;hed about a certain great wit lately decea&s;ed, who&s;e memory has been &s;o completely di&s;&s;ected by the operators in Stationer's Hall.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="180">Though I have as much re&s;pect for po&s;terity as any man can entertain for per&s;ons he is not acquainted with, &s;till I cannot under&s;tand how a po&s;t-obit of this &s;ort can profit me in my life, unle&s;s I could make it over to &s;ome purcha&s;er upon beneficial conditions. Now, as there are people in the world, who have done many famous actions without having once uttered a real good thing, as it is called, I &s;hould think my collection might be an acceptable purcha&s;e to a gentleman of this de&s;cription, and &s;uch an one &s;hould have it a bargain, as I would be very glad to give a fini&s;hing to his character, which I can be&s;t compare to a coat of Adams's plai&s;ter on a well-built hou&s;e.</P>
<P>For my own part, being neither more nor le&s;s than a haberda&s;her of &s;mall wares, and hav|ing &s;carcely rambled beyond the boundaries of the bills of mortality, &s;ince I was out of my ap|prentice&s;hip, I have not the pre&s;umption to think the anecdotes of my own life important enough for po&s;thumous publication; neither do I &s;uppo&s;e my writings, (though pretty numerous, as my books will te&s;tify, and many great names &s;tanding among&s;t them, which it is probable I &s;hall never cro&s;s out,) will be thought &s;o in|tere&s;ting to the public, as to come into compe|tition with the lively memoirs of a <HI>Bellamy</HI> and a
<PB N="174" REF="181">
<HI>Baddeley,</HI> who furni&s;h &s;o many agreeable records of many noble families, and are the &s;olace of more than half the toilets in town and country.</P>
<P>But to come more clo&s;ely to the chief pur|port of this letter&mdash;It was about a fortnight ago, that I cro&s;&s;ed upon you in the Poultry near the &s;hop-door of your worthy book&s;eller: I could not help giving a glance at your looks, and me|thought there was a morbid &s;allowne&s;s in your complexion and a &s;ickly languor in your eye, that indicated &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution: I watched you for &s;ome time, and as you turned into the &s;hop remarked the total want of energy in your &s;tep. I know whom I am &s;aying this to, and therefore am not afraid of &s;tartling you by my ob&s;er|vations, but if you actually perceive tho&s;e threat|ening &s;ymptoms, which I took notice of, it may probably be your wi&s;h to lay in &s;ome &s;tore for a journey you are &s;oon to take. You have al|ways been a friend and cu&s;tomer to me, and there is nobody I &s;hall more readily &s;erve than your&s;elf: I have long noticed with regret the very little favor you receive from your contem|poraries, and &s;hall gladly contribute to your kinder reception from po&s;terity; now I flatter my&s;elf, if you adopt my collection, you will at lea&s;t be celebrated for your &s;ayings, whatever may become of your writings.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="182">As for your private hi&s;tory, if I may gue&s;s from certain events, which have been reported to me, you may with a little allowable embel|li&s;hment make up a decent life of it. It was with great plea&s;ure I heard t'other day, that you was &s;tabbed by a monk in Portugal, broke your limbs in Spain and was poi&s;oned with a &s;allad at Paris; the&s;e with your adventures at &s;ea, your &s;ufferings at Bayonne and the treatment you re|ceived from your employers on your return, will be amu&s;ing anecdotes, and as it is generally &s;up|po&s;ed you have not ama&s;&s;ed any very great for|tune by the plunder of the public, your narrative will be read without rai&s;ing any envy in the reader, which will be &s;o much in your favor. Still your chief dependance mu&s;t re&s;t upon the collection I &s;hall &s;upply you with, and when the world comes to under&s;tand how many excellent things you &s;aid, and how much more wit you had than any of your contemporaries gave you credit for, they will begin to think you had not fair play whil&s;t you was alive, and who knows but they may take it in mind to rai&s;e a monu|ment to you by &s;ub&s;cription among&s;t other merry fellows of your day?</P>

<P>DARK and erroneous as the minds of men in general were before the appearance of Chri&s;t, no friend to Revelation ever meant to &s;ay, that all the gro&s;s and glaring ab&s;urdities of the heathen &s;y&s;tem, as vulgarly profe&s;&s;ed, were univer&s;ally adopted, and that no thinking man among&s;t them entertained better conceptions of God's nature and attributes, ju&s;ter notions of his &s;uperintendance and providence, purer maxims of morality and more elevated expectations of a future &s;tate, than are to be found in the extrava|gant accounts of their e&s;tabli&s;hed theology.

to &s;uch fabulous and chimerical legends, and in|deed it appears that opinions were permitted to pa&s;s without cen&s;ure, very irreconcileable to the popular faith, and great latitude given to &s;pecu|lation in their rea&s;onings upon natural religion; and what can be more gratifying to philanthropy, than to trace the&s;e efforts of right rea&s;on, which redound to the honour of man's nature, and ex|hibit to our view the human under&s;tanding, un|a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the lights of revelation and &s;upported only by it's natural powers, emerging from the darkne&s;s of idolatry, and breaking forth into the following de&s;cription of the Supreme Being, which is faithfully tran&s;lated from the fragment of an antient Greek tragic poet?&mdash;</P>
<Q>Let not mortal corruption mix with your idea of God, nor think of him as of a corporeal being, &s;uch as thy&s;elf; he is in&s;crutable to man, now appearing like fire, implacable in his anger; now in thick darkne&s;s, now in the flood of waters; now he puts on the terrors of a ravening bea&s;t, of the thunder, the winds, the lightning, of conflagrations, of clouds: Him the &s;eas obey, the &s;avage rocks, the &s;prings of fre&s;h water, and the rivers that flow along their winding channels; the earth her|&s;elf &s;tands in awe of him; the high tops of the mountains, the wide expan&s;e of the caerulean

<P>This is a &s;train in the &s;ublime &s;tile of the P&s;almi&s;t, and &s;imilar ideas of the Supreme Being may be collected from the remains of various heathen writers.</P>
<P><HI>Antiphanes,</HI> the Socratic philo&s;opher, &s;ays,

<P>The&s;e &s;elections, to which however many others might be added, will &s;erve to &s;hew what enlightened ideas were entertained by &s;ome of the nature of God. I will next adduce a few pa&s;&s;ages to &s;hew what ju&s;t conceptions &s;ome had formed of God's providence and ju&s;tice, of the di&s;tribution of good and evil in this life, and of the expectation of a future retribution in the life to come.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="187"><HI>Ari&s;ton,</HI> the dramatic poet, hath bequeathed us the following part of a dialogue&mdash;</P>
<Q><P>Take heart; be patient! God will not fail to help the good, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e, who are as excellent as your&s;elf; where would be the encouragement to per&s;i&s;t in righteou&s;ne&s;s, un|le&s;s tho&s;e, who do well, are eminently to be rewarded for their well-doing?</P>

<P>For the pre&s;ent moment it may be &s;o, but we mu&s;t look beyond the pre&s;ent moment and await the i&s;&s;ue, when this earth &s;hall be di&s;|&s;olved: For to think that chance governs the affairs of this life, is a notion as fal&s;e as it is evil, and is the plea, which vicious men &s;et up for vicious morals: But be thou &s;ure that the good works of the righteous &s;hall meet a re|ward, and the iniquities of the unrighteous a puni&s;hment; for nothing can come to pa&s;s in this world, but by the will and permi&s;&s;ion of God.</P></Q>

<P><HI>Euripides</HI> has the following pa&s;&s;age,
<Q REND="inline">"If any mortal flatters him&s;elf that the &s;in, which he commits, can e&s;cape the notice of an avenging Deity, he indulges a vain hope, deceiving him&s;elf in a fal&s;e pre&s;umption of impunity, be|cau&s;e the divine ju&s;tice &s;u&s;pends for a time the puni&s;hment of his evil actions; but hearken to me, ye who &s;ay there is no God, and by that wicked infidelity enhance your crimes, There is, there is a God!

<P>The Sibylline ver&s;es hold the &s;ame language, but the&s;e I have taken notice of in a former volume.</P>
<P>I re&s;erve my&s;elf for one more extract, which I &s;hall recommend to the reader as the fine&s;t, which can be in&s;tanced from any heathen writer, exhibiting the mo&s;t elevated conceptions of the being and &s;uperintendance of one, &s;upreme, all-&s;eeing, ineffable God, and of the exi&s;tence of a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, by the ju&s;t di&s;tribution of which to the good and evil all the &s;eeming irregularities of moral ju&s;tice in this
<PB N="182" REF="189">
life &s;hall hereafter be &s;et &s;trait; and this, if I mi&s;take not, is the &s;ummary of all that natural religion can attain to. The following is a clo&s;e tran&s;lation of this famous fragment&mdash;</P>
<Q><SP>
<P>Thinke&s;t thou, O Niceratus, that tho&s;e de|parted &s;pirits, who are &s;atiated with the luxu|ries of life, &s;hall e&s;cape as if from an oblivious God? The eye of ju&s;tice is wakeful and all|&s;eeing; and we may truly pronounce that there are two &s;everal roads conducting us to the grave; one proper to the ju&s;t, the other to the unju&s;t; for if ju&s;t and unju&s;t fare alike, and the grave &s;hall cover both to all eternity&mdash;Hence! get thee hence at once! de&s;troy, lay wa&s;te, defraud, confound at plea&s;ure! But de|ceive not thy&s;elf; there is a judgment after death, which God, the lord of all things, will exact, who&s;e tremendous name is not to be uttered by my lips, and He it is, who limits the appointed date of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>It is curious to di&s;cover &s;entiments of this ve|nerable &s;ort in the fragment of a Greek comedy, yet certain it is that it has either <HI>Philemon</HI> or <HI>Diphilus</HI> for it's author, both writers of the New Comedy and contemporaries. Ju&s;tin, Clemens and Eu&s;ebius have all quoted it, the former from <HI>Philemon,</HI> both the latter from <HI>Diphilus:</HI> Gro|tius and Le Clerc follow the authority of Ju&s;tin,
<PB REF="190">
and in&s;ert it in their collection of <HI>Philemon</HI>'s fragments; Hertelius upon the joint authorities of Clemens and Eu&s;ebius gives it to <HI>Diphilus,</HI> and publi&s;hes it as &s;uch in his valuable and rare remains of the Greek comic writers. I con|ceive there are now no <HI>data,</HI> upon which criti|ci&s;m can decide for either of the&s;e two claimants, and the honour mu&s;t accordingly remain &s;u&s;|pended between them.</P>
<P>Sentences of this &s;ort are certainly very pre|cious reliques, and their pre&s;ervation is owing to a happy cu&s;tom, which the Greeks had of marking the margins of their books oppo&s;ite to any pa&s;&s;age, which particularly &s;truck them, and this mark was generally the letter &khgr;, the initial of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, [u&s;eful] and the collection afterwards made of the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed pa&s;&s;ages they called <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>It would be a curious and amu&s;ing collation of moral and religious &s;entences, extracted from heathen writers, with corre&s;ponding texts, &s;e|lected from the holy &s;criptures: Grotius hath done &s;omething towards it in his preface to the <HI>Collectanea</HI> of Stobaeus; but the quotations al|ready given will &s;uffice to &s;hew in a general point of view what had been the advances of human rea&s;on before God enlightened the world by his &s;pecial Revelation.</P>

<PB REF="191">
<HEAD>N^o CXIV.</HEAD>
<P>IF the dei&s;t, who contends for the all-&s;uf|ficiency of natural religion, &s;hall think that in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, which I have quoted in the preceding number, he has di&s;covered fre&s;h re|&s;ources on the part of human rea&s;on as oppo&s;ed to divine revelation, he will find him&s;elf in|volved in a very fal&s;e conclu&s;ion. Though it were in my power to have collected every moral and religious &s;entence, which has fallen from the pens of the heathen writers antecedent to Chri&s;tianity, and although it &s;hould thereby ap|pear that the morality of the go&s;pel had been the morality of right rea&s;on in all ages of the world, he would &s;till remain as much unfurni&s;hed as ever for e&s;tabli&s;hing his favorite po&s;ition, that the &s;criptures reveal nothing more than man's un|der&s;tanding had di&s;covered without their aid. We may therefore con&s;ole our&s;elves without &s;cruple in di&s;covering that the heathen world was not immer&s;ed in total darkne&s;s, and the candid mind, however intere&s;ted for Chri&s;tianity, may be gratified with the reflection that the hu|man under&s;tanding was not &s;o wholly en&s;laved,
<PB N="185" REF="192">
but that in certain in&s;tances it could &s;urmount the prejudices of &s;y&s;tem, and, ca&s;ting off the &s;hackles of idolatry, argue up to that &s;upreme of all things, which the hi&s;torian Tacitus emphati|cally defines, <HI>&s;ummum illud et aeternum neque mu|tabile neque interiturum.</HI></P>
<P>Now when the mind is &s;ettled in the proof of One Supreme Being, there are two &s;everal modes of rea&s;oning, by which natural religion may deduce the probability of a future &s;tate: one of the&s;e re&s;ults from an examination of the human &s;oul, the other from reflecting on the unequal di&s;tribution of happine&s;s in the pre&s;ent life.</P>
<P>Every man, who is capable of examining his own faculties, mu&s;t di&s;cern a certain power within him, which is neither coaeval with, nor dependant upon his body and it's members; I mean that power of reflection, which we uni|ver&s;ally agree to &s;eat in the &s;oul: It is not co|aeval with the body, becau&s;e we were not in the u&s;e and exerci&s;e of it, when we were infants; it is not dependant on it, becau&s;e it is not &s;ubject to the changes, which the body undergoes in it's pa&s;&s;age from the womb to the grave; for in|&s;tance, it is not de&s;troyed, or even impaired, by amputation of the limbs or members, it does not evaporate by the continual flux and ex|halation
<PB N="186" REF="193">
of the corporeal humours, is not di&s;|turbed by motion of the limbs, nor deprived of it's powers by their inaction; it is not nece&s;&s;arily involved in the &s;ickne&s;s and infirmity of the body, for whil&s;t that is decaying and di&s;&s;olving away by an incurable di&s;ea&s;e, the intellectual fa|culties &s;hall in many ca&s;es remain perfect and unimpaired: Why then &s;hould it be &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;oul of a man is to die with his body, and accompany it into the oblivious grave, when it did not make it's entrance with it into life, nor partook of it's decay, it's fluctuations, changes and ca&s;ualties?</P>
<P>If the&s;e obvious reflections upon the nature and properties of the &s;oul lead to the per&s;ua&s;ion of a future &s;tate, the &s;ame train of rea&s;oning will naturally di&s;cover that the condition of the &s;oul in that future &s;tate mu&s;t be determined by the merits or demerits of it's antecedent life. It has never been the notion of heathen or of dei&s;t, that both the good and the evil &s;hall enter upon equal and undi&s;tingui&s;hed felicity or puni&s;h|ment; no rea&s;oning man could ever conceive that the &s;oul of Nero and the &s;oul of Antoninus in a future &s;tate partook of the &s;ame common lot; and thus it follows upon the evidence of rea&s;on, that the &s;oul of man &s;hall be rewarded or puni&s;hed hereafter according to his good or evil
<PB N="187" REF="194">
conduct here; and this con&s;equence is the more obvious, becau&s;e it does not appear in the moral government of the world, that any &s;uch ju&s;t and regular di&s;tribution of rewards and puni&s;hments obtains on this &s;ide the grave; a circum&s;tance no otherwi&s;e to be reconciled to our &s;uitable conceptions of divine ju&s;tice, than by referring things to the final deci&s;ion of a judgment to come.</P>
<P>Though all the&s;e di&s;coveries are open to rea|&s;on, let no man conclude that what the rea&s;on of a few di&s;covered were either communicated to, or acknowledged by all: No; the world was dark and gro&s;sly ignorant; &s;ome indeed have argued well and clearly; others confu&s;edly, and the bulk of mankind not at all; the being of a God, and the unity of that Supreme Being &s;truck conviction to the hearts of tho&s;e, who employed their rea&s;on coolly and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately in &s;uch &s;ub|lime enquiries; but where was the multitude meanwhile? Bewildered with a mob of deities, whom their own fables had endowed with human attributes, pa&s;&s;ions and infirmities; whom their own &s;uper&s;tition had deified and enrolled among&s;t the immortals, till the &s;acred hi&s;tory of Olympus became no le&s;s impure than the journals of a brothel: Many there were no doubt, who &s;aw the mon&s;trous ab&s;urdity of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, yet not
<PB N="188" REF="195">
every one, who di&s;cerned error, could di&s;cover truth; the immortality of the &s;oul, a doctrine &s;o harmonious to man's nature, was decried by &s;y&s;tem and oppo&s;ed by &s;ubtilty; the que&s;tion of a future &s;tate was hung up in doubt, or bandied between conflicting di&s;putants through all the quirks and eva&s;ions of &s;ophi&s;try and logic: Phi|lo&s;ophy, &s;o called, was &s;plit into a variety of &s;ects, and the hypothe&s;is of each enthu&s;ia&s;tic founder became the &s;tanding creed of his &s;chool, from which it was an inviolable point of honour never to de&s;ert: In this confu&s;ion of &s;y&s;tems men cho&s;e for them&s;elves not according to con|viction, but by the impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, or from motives of convenience; the voluptuary was in|tere&s;ted to di&s;mi&s;s the gods to their repo&s;e, that his might not be interrupted by them; and all, who wi&s;hed to have their range of &s;en&s;uality in this world without fear or controul, readily en|li&s;ted under the banners of Epicurus, till his fol|lowers outnumbered all the re&s;t; this was the court-creed under the wor&s;t of the Roman em|perors, and the whole body of the nation, with few exceptions, adopted it; for what could be more natural, than for the de&s;perate to bury con&s;cience in the grave of athei&s;m, or ru&s;h into annihilation by the point of the poniard, when they were weary of exi&s;tence and di&s;carded by

fortune? With &s;ome it was the &s;tandard prin|ciple of their &s;ect to doubt, with others to argue every thing; and when we recollect that Cicero him&s;elf was of the <HI>New Academy,</HI> we have a clue to unravel all the &s;eeming contradictions of his moral and metaphy&s;ical &s;entiments, amid&s;t the confu&s;ion of which we are never to expect his real opinion, but within the pale of his own particular &s;chool, and that &s;chool profe&s;&s;ed con|trover&s;y upon every point. I will in&s;tance one pa&s;&s;age, which would have done honour to his &s;entiments, had he &s;poke his own language as well as that of the Platoni&s;ts, whom he is here per&s;onating&mdash;<HI>Nec vero Deus, qui intelligitur a nobis, alio modo intelligi pote&s;t, quam mens &s;oluta quaedam et libena, &s;egregata ab omni concretione mortali, omnia &s;entiens et movens.</HI> Whil&s;t the pure&s;t truths were thrown out only as themes for &s;ophi&s;try to cavil at, the ma&s;s of mankind re&s;embled a chaos, in which if &s;ome few &s;parks of light glimmered, they only &s;erved to ca&s;t the general horror into darker &s;hades.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not however be forgotten, that there was a peculiar people then upon earth, who profe&s;&s;ed to wor&s;hip that one Supreme Being, of who&s;e nature and attributes certain individuals only among&s;t the Gentile nations entertained &s;uitable conceptions.</P>

<P>FROM the review we have taken of the &s;tate of mankind in re&s;pect to their re|ligious opinions at the Chri&s;tian aera it appears, that the Gentile world was &s;y&s;tematically de|voted to idolatry, whil&s;t the remnant of the Jewi&s;h tribes profe&s;&s;ed the wor&s;hip of the true God; but at the &s;ame time there did not exi&s;t on earth any other temple dedicated to God's &s;ervice, &s;ave that at Jeru&s;alem. The nation &s;o highly favoured by him, and &s;o enlightened by his immediate revelations, was in the lowe&s;t &s;tate of political and religious declen&s;ion; ten out of their twelve tribes had been carried away into captivity, from which there has to this hour been no redemption, and the remaining two were brought under the Roman yoke, and di|vided into &s;ects, one of which oppo&s;ed the opinion of the other, and maintained that there was to be no re&s;urrection of the dead: The controver&s;y was momentous, for the eternal wel|fare of mankind was the object of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and who was to decide upon it? The wor&s;hippers of the true God had one place only upon earth,
<PB N="194" REF="201">
wherein to call upon his name; the groves and altars of the idols occupied all the re&s;t; who was to re&s;tore his wor&s;hip? Who was to re|deem mankind from almo&s;t total ignorance and corruption?

<P>Let any man ca&s;t his ideas back to this pe|riod, and a&s;k his rea&s;on, if it was not natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Almighty Being, to whom this general ruin and di&s;order mu&s;t be vi&s;ible, would in mercy to his creatures &s;end &s;ome help among&s;t them; unle&s;s it had been his purpo&s;e to abandon them to de&s;truction, we may pre&s;ume to &s;ay he &s;urely would: Is it then with man to pre&s;cribe in what particular mode and form that re|demption &s;hould come? Certainly it is not with man, but with God only; he, who grants
<PB N="195" REF="202">
the vouch&s;afement, will direct the means: Be the&s;e what they may, they mu&s;t be praeternatural and miraculous, becau&s;e we have agreed that it is beyond the reach of man by any natural powers of his own to accompli&s;h: A &s;pecial in|&s;piration then is requi&s;ite; &s;ome revelation it &s;hould &s;eem, we know not what, we know not how, nor where, nor whence, except that it mu&s;t come from God him&s;elf: What if he &s;ends a Being upon earth to tell us his immediate will, to teach us how to plea&s;e him and to convince us of the reality of a future &s;tate? That Being then mu&s;t come down from him, he mu&s;t have powers miraculous, he mu&s;t have qualities di|vine and perfect, he mu&s;t return on earth from the grave, and per&s;onally &s;hew us that he has &s;urvived it, and is corporeally living after death: Will this be evidence demon&s;trative? Who can with&s;tand it? He mu&s;t be of all men mo&s;t ob|&s;tinately bent upon his own de&s;truction, who &s;hould attempt to hold out again&s;t it; he mu&s;t prefer darkne&s;s to light, fal&s;ehood to truth, mi|&s;ery to happine&s;s, hell to heaven, who would not thankfully embrace &s;o great &s;alvation.</P>

If he is pre|&s;ented to the world in &s;ome mode &s;uperior to and differing from the ordinary cour&s;e of nature, &s;uch an introduction mu&s;t attract to his per&s;on and character a more than ordinary attention: If a miraculous and my&s;terious Being appears upon earth, &s;o compounded of divine and hu|man nature as to &s;urpa&s;s our comprehen&s;ion of his immediate e&s;&s;ence, and at the &s;ame time &s;o levelled to our earthly ideas, as to be vi&s;ibly born of a human mother, not impregnated after the manner of the fle&s;h, but by the immediate Spirit of God, in other words the &s;on of a pure virgin, &s;hall we make the my&s;terious incarna|tion of &s;uch a praeternatural being a rea&s;on for our di&s;belief in that revelation, which without a miracle we had not given credit to? We are told that the birth of Chri&s;t was in this wi&s;e; the fact re&s;ts upon the authority of the evange|li&s;ts who de&s;cribe it: The Unitarians, who pro|fe&s;s Chri&s;tianity with this exception, may di&s;pute the te&s;timony of the &s;acred writers in this par|ticular,

and the Jews may deny their account <HI>in toto,</HI> but &s;till if Chri&s;t him&s;elf performed mira|cles, which the Jews do not deny, and if he ro&s;e from the dead after his crucifixion, which the Unitarians admit, I do not &s;ee how either &s;hould be &s;taggered by the miracle of his birth: for of the Jews I may demand, whether it were not a thing as credible for God to have wrought a mi|racle at the birth of Mo&s;es for in&s;tance, as that he &s;hould afterwards empower that prophet to perform, not one only, but many miracles? To the Unitarians I would candidly &s;ubmit, if it be not as ea&s;y to believe the incarnation of Chri&s;t as his re&s;urrection, the authorities for each being the &s;ame?

<P>The learned Jew is founded in his ob&s;ervation upon the non-accordance of the&s;e pedigrees, but not in applying that to Chri&s;t, which relates only to Jo&s;eph.

to render a true account of Chri&s;t's mi&s;&s;ion, compri&s;ing only a &s;hort period of his life; within the compa&s;s of this period they are to record the doctrines he preached, the miracles he performed, and the circum&s;tances of his death, pa&s;&s;ion, and re&s;urrection; to this undertaking they are fairly committed; this they are to execute as faithful reporters, and if their reports &s;hall be found in any e&s;&s;ential matter contradic|tory to each other or them&s;elves, let the learned author late mentioned, or any other opponent to Chri&s;tianity point it out, and candour mu&s;t ad|mit the charge; but in the matter of a pedigree, which appertains to Jo&s;eph, which our church univer&s;ally omits in it's &s;ervice, which compri&s;es no article of doctrine, and which, being purely matter of family record, was copied probably from one roll by Matthew, and from another by Luke, I cannot in truth and &s;incerity &s;ee how the &s;acred hi&s;torians are impeached by the non|agreement of their accounts. We call them the <HI>in&s;pired</HI> writers, and when any &s;uch trivial con|tradiction as the above can be fixed upon them by the enemies of our faith, the word is retorted upon us with triumph; but what has in&s;piration to do with the genealogy of Jo&s;eph, <HI>the &s;up|po&s;ed,</HI> not the real, father of Je&s;us?

<P>Let this &s;uffice for what relates to the birth of Chri&s;t and the different ways, in which men ar|gue upon that my&s;terious event: If his coming was foretold, and if his per&s;on and character fully an&s;wer to tho&s;e predictions, no man will deny the force of &s;uch an evidence: If we are &s;imply told that a <HI>virgin did conceive and bear a &s;on,</HI> it is a circum&s;tance &s;o much out of the ordinary cour&s;e of nature to happen, that it re|quires great faith in the veracity of the relater to believe it; but if we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an authentic record of high antecedent antiquity, wherein we find it expre&s;sly predicted, that &s;uch a cir|cum&s;tance &s;hall happen, and that <HI>a virgin &s;hall conceive and bear a &s;on,</HI> it is &s;uch a confirmation of the fact, that, wonderful as it is, we can no longer doubt the truth of the hi&s;torians who atte&s;t it. Now it is not one, but many prophets, who concur in foretelling the coming of the Me&s;&s;ias; his per&s;on, his office, his humility and &s;ufferings, his ignominious death and the glo|rious benefits re&s;ulting from his atonement are not merely glanced at with aenigmatic ob&s;curity, but pointedly and preci&s;ely announced.

<P>I have &s;aid there was but one temple upon earth, where the only true and living God was wor&s;hipped, the temple at Jeru&s;alem: The Jews had derived and continued this wor&s;hip from the time of Abraham, and to him the promi&s;es were made, that <HI>in his &s;eed all the nations of the world &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> Where then are w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> naturally to look for the Me&s;&s;ias but from the &s;tock of Abraham, from the de&s;cendants of that family, in which alone were pre&s;erved the knowledge and wor&s;hip of the only true God?

<P>We are told by one of the &s;acred hi&s;torians, that <HI>the Jews came round about him and &s;aid unto him, How long do&s;t thou make us to doubt?

Chri&s;t came to &s;ave and not to de&s;troy the world, and the works above de&s;cribed are no le&s;s merciful in their nature, than miraculous.</P>
<P>When the Jews therefore tauntingly a&s;&s;ert the &s;uperior magnificence of the miracles wrought by Mo&s;es, which we admit to have been in all re&s;pects &s;uitable to the commi&s;&s;ion which Mo&s;es was encharged with, they &s;hould with equal candor admit, that the le&s;s &s;plendid, but more &s;alutary, miracles of Chri&s;t, were no le&s;s &s;uited to the merciful commi&s;&s;ion, which he came among&s;t us to perform.

Surely it is as great a miracle to give life to the dead, as it is to put the living to death.</P>
<P>The miracles of Chri&s;t were performed without o&s;tentation and di&s;play, yet they were of &s;uch general notoriety, that the Jews them|&s;elves did not, and do not even now, deny their being wrought by him, but a&s;cribed them to the aid and agency of the Devil: A mi&s;erable &s;ubterfuge indeed! But this is not all: A contemporary writer of that nation, <HI>David Levi,</HI> in his letter to Dr. Prie&s;tley a&s;&s;erts, that there was not only <HI>no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for the miracles of Je&s;us as for tho&s;e of Mo&s;es, but <HI>that they were &s;carcely ju&s;t or rational, and con|&s;equently cannot be offered as proofs of his di|vine mi&s;&s;ion in compari&s;on with that of Mo&s;es, p.</HI> 67. 68.</P>

<P>This we may admit in it's full force; but as the miracles, which Chri&s;t wrought were alto|gether as <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for the proof of his divine mi&s;&s;ion, as the&s;e of Mo&s;es for the proof of his; a man mu&s;t be very partial to his own nation, who will a&s;&s;ert, that the deliverance of the Jews from their captivity in Egypt was a more im|portant object than the redemption of lo&s;t man|kind. We will not doubt but it was <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> the Egyptian ho&s;t &s;hould be drowned, becau&s;e it &s;eemed good to God &s;o to puni&s;h their obduracy, and extricate the Jewi&s;h tribes; but it is no le&s;s <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> that mankind &s;hould believe in Chri&s;t, if they are to be &s;aved through his means, and for the confirmation of that <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> faith, the&s;e miracles were performed: The author of the objection, who him&s;elf a&s;&s;erts that Mo&s;es deli|vered the important doctrine of a future &s;tate, will not deny that the belief of a future &s;tate is a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> belief; and if it be &s;o, it mu&s;t follow that Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection and appearance upon earth after his crucifixion, (a miracle I pre&s;ume

as great and &s;triking as any wrought by the hand of Mo&s;es) was as pertinent to that general end, as the wonders in the land of Egypt and at the Red Sea were to the particular purpo&s;e of re&s;|cuing the Jews out of their captivity.</P>
<P>If we grant that Mo&s;es, as this objector in|timates, did impart the doctrine of a future &s;tate, Chri&s;t did more by exemplifying it in his own per&s;on, and again&s;t &s;uch evidence we might pre|&s;ume even a Sadducee would not hold out. Now as &s;o large a portion of the Jewi&s;h nation were &s;till in the avowed di&s;belief of that doctrine, which our opponent believes was taught them by their great prophet and lawgiver him&s;elf, &s;urely he mu&s;t of force allow, that the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t was to them at lea&s;t, and to all who like them did not credit the doctrine of a life to come, a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> miracle.</P>

<P>This miracle is recorded al&s;o by Saint Mark, v.1. and again by Saint Luke, viii.26. What Saint Matthew calls the country of the Gerge|&s;enes, the other two evangeli&s;ts call the country of the Gadarenes, and St. Luke adds that it is over again&s;t Galilee; this country, as I con|ceive, was within the boundaries of the half tribe of Mana&s;&s;eh, on the other &s;ide of Jordan, and is by Strabo called <HI>Gadarida,</HI> lib. 16. Now Mo&s;es both in Leviticus xi. and Deuteronomy xiv. prohibits &s;wine, as one of the unclean bea&s;ts: <HI>Of their fle&s;h &s;hall ye not eat, and their carca&s;e &s;hall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.</HI> I&s;aiah al&s;o &s;tates it as a particular &s;in and abomination in the Jews, whom he calleth <HI>a rebellious people, a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; which remain among the graves and lodge in the monuments, which eat &s;wine's fle&s;h. lxv.</HI>2, 3, 4.

It would be hard indeed if Chri&s;t, whom he arraigns for aboli&s;hing the Mo&s;aical di&s;pen&s;ation in one part of his argument, &s;hould in another be accu&s;ed of wrong and injury for conforming to it: But any wretched &s;hift &s;hall be re&s;orted to for matter of railing again&s;t Chri&s;t, and rather than not feed his &s;pleen at all, he will feed it upon &s;wine's fle&s;h: Let the learned Jew fir&s;t prove to me that a hog was not an abomination to his countrymen, and it will then be time enough to debate upon the <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> of de&s;troying them; meanwhile I &s;hall not be di&s;|po&s;ed to allow of any damages for the &s;wine in que&s;tion at the &s;uit and pro&s;ecution of a Jew.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="217">His &s;econd attack is pointed again&s;t the mira|cle of the fig-tree, which was bla&s;ted at the word of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Though Saint Matthew as well as Saint Mark, records this miracle, yet, for rea&s;ons &s;uf|ficiently obvious, he refers to the latter, who &s;ays, <HI>that when Chri&s;t came to it he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.</HI> His argument upon this pa&s;&s;age is as follows: <HI>Hence it is manife&s;t, that he required the tree to produce fruit out of &s;ea&s;on, and which would have been contrary to the intent of it's creator; and therefore he, as a dutiful &s;on, cur&s;es the innocent and guiltle&s;s tree for doing that, which his father had commanded it to do, viz. to bear fruit in it's proper &s;ea&s;on:</HI> In this paragraph our Jew has quickened his ar|gument with &s;ome facetious irony, and he fol|lows it with an air of exultation as well as in&s;ult: <HI>If, after this, Chri&s;tians &s;hould &s;till per&s;i&s;t in the miracle, according to the letter of the &s;tory, much good may it do them; but I am &s;ure it will never be the means of converting the unbelieving Jews to the Chri&s;tian faith.</HI></P>
<P>I clo&s;e with him in opinion that this miracle will not be the means of converting his unbe|lieving brethren to Chri&s;tianity; for how can I hope, that what their fathers &s;aw and yet be|lieved not, &s;hould at this di&s;tant period gain be|lief from their po&s;terity? I al&s;o join with him in
<PB N="211" REF="218">
&s;aying (and I &s;u&s;pect I &s;ay it with &s;omewhat more &s;incerity) <HI>much good may it do</HI> to all tho&s;e Chri&s;tians, who per&s;i&s;t in their belief of it! A de&s;cendant of tho&s;e who murdered Chri&s;t, may act in character, when he in&s;ults his miracles and ridicules his per&s;on, but a believer in Chri&s;t will be an imitator of his patience.</P>
<P>It is now time to di&s;mi&s;s the irony and apply to the argument. This &s;imply turns upon Saint Mark's interjectional ob&s;ervation, not noticed by Saint Matthew in his account, viz. <HI>that the time of figs was not yet:</HI> He &s;ays, that Je&s;us being hungry &s;aw a fig-tree afar off, having leaves, and came if haply he might find any thing thereon: By this it appears that the tree was in leaf, and Je&s;us approached it with the expecta|tion of finding &s;omething thereon; but when he found nothing but leaves, he &s;aid unto it, <HI>No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever!</HI> And his di&s;ci|ples heard it; The&s;e came again the next morn|ing, and pa&s;&s;ing by the fig-tree &s;aw it dried up from the roots; which when Peter remarked as a completion of the miracle, Je&s;us &s;aid to them all, HAVE FAITH IN GOD!</P>
<P>In the&s;e important words we have the moral of the act. The tree, which this reviler takes upon him&s;elf to &s;ay, was <HI>commanded</HI> by God <HI>to bear fruit in it's proper &s;ea&s;on,</HI> was on the contrary commanded by God to bear fruit no more, but
<PB N="212" REF="219">
&s;erve a nobler purpo&s;e by witne&s;&s;ing to the mira|culous power of Chri&s;t; and now if <HI>an innocent and guiltle&s;s tree</HI> was bla&s;ted out of &s;ea&s;on by the word of Chri&s;t for the purpo&s;e of in&s;piring the beholders with <HI>Faith in God,</HI> the benefit confer|red upon human nature may well atone for the injury done to vegetable nature; though I am free to acknowledge to it's pathetic advocate, that, as a Jew, he has undertaken a more cleanly cau&s;e, than when he before &s;tood forth in defence of the hogs: As well may he bewail <HI>the inno|cent and guiltle&s;s trees</HI> and grain of Egypt, which were &s;mitten by the hail, when Mo&s;es called it down upon the land, if &s;uch be his tender feelings toward the productions of the earth, as this &s;in|gle fig-tree: Till he can convince us that the deliverance of the Jews from their Egyptian bondage was a more important object than the redemption of the world, he will find it hard to make a rea&s;oning man allow, that this &s;ingle fig-tree, even though it had no right to bear fruit, hath a &s;tronger appeal to ju&s;tice again&s;t the miracle of Chri&s;t, than <HI>every herb of the field that was &s;mitten, every</HI> guiltle&s;s and innocent <HI>tree of the field that was broken</HI> by the &s;tretching forth of the rod of Mo&s;es.</P>

<P>IF it were nece&s;&s;ary to enter into a more literal defence of the miracle of the bla&s;ted fig-tree, I &s;ee no ab&s;olute rea&s;on to conclude with the caviller, that Chri&s;t required the tree to pro|duce fruit out of &s;ea&s;on and act again&s;t it's nature; for if <HI>the time of figs</HI> be the gathering or harve&s;t of figs, it was more rea&s;onable to expect fruit from this tree before the time of plucking, than after it; and as this fruit was no &s;mall article in the produce and traffick of Judaea, we may well conclude <HI>the time of figs,</HI> mentioned by Saint Mark, was like the vintage in the wine coun|tries; and I apprehend it would not be an un|rea&s;onable expectation to find a clu&s;ter of grapes on a vine, before the time of vintage was come. This con&s;truction of the words will &s;eem the more rea&s;onable, when we remark that Saint Matthew, who records the miracle, takes no account of this circum&s;tance, and that Saint Mark, who &s;tates it, &s;tates al&s;o that Chri&s;t in his hunger applied to the tree, <HI>if haply he might find any thing thereon,</HI> which implies expec|tation.</P>
<P>But our Jew hath &s;ugge&s;ted a better method
<PB N="214" REF="221">
of performing the miracle by commanding fruit from a withered tree in&s;tead of bla&s;ting a living one; which, &s;ays he, <HI>if Je&s;us had done, it would have been &s;uch an in&s;tance of his power, as to have rendered the proof of the miracle indi&s;putable.</HI></P>
<P>Here let him &s;tand to his confe&s;&s;ion, and I take him at his word: I agree with him in owning that the miracle, as he &s;tates it, would have been indi&s;putable, had Chri&s;t given liffe and fruit to a withered tree; and I demand of him to agree with me, that the miracle was indi&s;putable, when the &s;ame Chri&s;t gave breath and life to dead Lazarus.</P>
<P>But alas! I can hardly expect that the rai&s;ing a dead tree to life would have been thus &s;ucce&s;s|ful, though even infidelity a&s;&s;erts it, when the miracle of re&s;toring a dead man to life hath not &s;ilenced his cavils, but left him to quibble about hogs and figs, and even in the face of his own confe&s;&s;ion to arraign the Savior of the world as <HI>unju&s;t and irrational</HI> through the channel of a Chri&s;tian pre&s;s: Neither am I bound to admit, that his correction of the miracle would in any re&s;pect have amended it; for, as an in&s;tance of Chri&s;t's miraculous power, I can &s;ee no greater energy in the act of enlivening a dead tree, than in de&s;troying a living one by the &s;ingle word of his command.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="222">I mu&s;t yet a&s;k patience of the reader, whil&s;t I attend upon this objector to another cavil &s;tarted again&s;t this miracle of the fig-tree, in the account of which he &s;ays there is a contradiction of dates between Saint Matthew and Saint Mark, for that in the former it appears <HI>Chri&s;t fir&s;t ca&s;t the buyers and &s;ellers out of the temple, and on the morrow cur&s;ed the fig-tree; whereas according to Saint Mark it was tran&s;acted before the driving them out of the temple, and &s;uch a manife&s;t contra|diction mu&s;t greatly affect the credibility of the hi&s;tory.</HI></P>
<P>Whether or not a day's di&s;agreement in the dates would &s;o <HI>greatly affect the credibility of the hi&s;tory</HI> we are not called upon to argue, becau&s;e it will be found that no &s;uch contradiction exi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Saint Mark agrees with Saint Matthew in &s;aying that <HI>Je&s;us entered into Jeru&s;alem and into the temple,</HI> and on the morrow cur&s;ed the fig-tree; he then adds that he returned to Jeru|&s;alem and drove the buyers and &s;ellers out of the temple: Again, the next morning he and his di&s;ciples pa&s;&s;ed by the fig-tree and &s;aw it dried up from the roots: This is told in detail.</P>
<P>Saint Matthew agrees with Saint Mark in &s;aying Je&s;us went into the temple the day before he de&s;troyed the fig-tree, but he does not break
<PB N="216" REF="223">
the narrative into detail, as Saint Mark does; for as he relates the whole miracle of the fig-tree at once, compri&s;ing the events of two days in one account, &s;o doth he give the whole of what pa&s;&s;ed in the temple at once al&s;o.</P>
<P>Both Evangeli&s;ts agree in making Chri&s;t's entrance into the temple antecedent to his mi|racle; but Saint Matthew with more brevity puts the whole of each incident into one ac|count, Saint Mark more circum&s;tantially details every particular: And this is the mighty con|tradiction, which David Levi hath di&s;covered in the &s;acred hi&s;torians, upon which he exultingly pronounces, that <HI>he is confident there are a num|ber of others as glaring as this; but which he has not at pre&s;ent either time or inclination to point out.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e menaces I &s;hall expect he will make good, for when his time &s;erves to point them out, I dare believe his inclination will not &s;tand in the way.</P>
<P>In the meantime let it be remembered that David Levi &s;tands pledged as the author of an un&s;upported charge again&s;t the veracity of the Evangeli&s;ts, and let every faithful Chri&s;tian, to whom tho&s;e holy records are dear, but mo&s;t of all the proper guardians of our church, be pre|pared to meet their opponent and his charge.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="224">But our caviller hath not yet done with the Evangeli&s;ts, for he a&s;&s;erts that <HI>they are not only contradictory to each other, but are incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves; for what can be more &s;o than Matthew</HI> i. 18. <HI>with Matthew</HI> xiii. 55.?</P>
<P>Now mark the contradiction! <HI>The birth of Je&s;us was on this wi&s;e; When as his mother Mary was e&s;pou&s;ed to Jo&s;eph, before they came to|gether, &s;he was found with child of the Holy Gho&s;t.

<P>Need any child be told, that in the fir&s;t text Saint Matthew &s;peaks, and in the &s;econd the ca|villing Jews? who then can wonder if they di&s;|agree? as well we might expect agreement be|tween truth and fal&s;ehood, between the Evan|geli&s;t and <HI>David Levi,</HI> as between two pa&s;&s;ages of &s;uch oppo&s;ite characters. Is this the man, who is to confute the holy &s;criptures? Weak champion of an unworthy cau&s;e!</P>
<P>What he means by an incon&s;i&s;tency between <HI>Luke</HI> i.34, 35. and <HI>Luke</HI> xiv.22. I cannot un|der&s;tand, and conclude there mu&s;t be an error of the pre&s;s, of which I think no author can have le&s;s rea&s;on to complain, than <HI>David Levi.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e two unpro&s;perous attacks being the
<PB N="218" REF="225">
whole of what he attempts upon the incon|&s;i&s;tency of the &s;acred hi&s;torians with them&s;elves, I &s;hall no longer detain my readers, than whil&s;t I notice one more cavil, which this author points again&s;t the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, as compared with that of Mo&s;es, viz. <HI>That God &s;peaking with Mo&s;es face to face in the pre&s;ence of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and men, be&s;ides women and children, as men|tioned in Exod.</HI> xix.9. <HI>was &s;uch an e&s;&s;ential proof of the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Mo&s;es, as is wanting on the part of Je&s;us</HI>; and therefore he concludes, that taking the miracles of Mo&s;es and this colloquy with the Supreme Being together, the evidences for him are much &s;tronger than for Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>A man, who does not in&s;tantly di&s;cern the fu|tility of this argument, mu&s;t forget all the &s;e|veral incidents in the hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t, where the voice of God audibly te&s;tifies to his divine mi&s;&s;ion; for in&s;tance <HI>Matth.</HI> iii.16, 17. <HI>And Je&s;us, when he was baptized, went up &s;traitway out of the water, and lo! the heavens were opened unto him, and he &s;aw the Spirit of God de&s;cending like a dove, and lighting upon him; and lo! a voice from heaven, &s;aying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed.</HI> The &s;ame is re|peated by <HI>Mark,</HI> i.10, 11.; again by <HI>Luke,</HI> iii.21, 22.; again by <HI>John,</HI> i.32, 33, 34.</P>
<P>If the&s;e &s;upernatural &s;igns and declarations do
<PB N="219" REF="226">
not evince the &s;uperiority of Chri&s;t's mi&s;&s;ion above that of Mo&s;es, if Chri&s;t, to whom angels mini&s;tered, when the devil in de&s;pair departed from him, Chri&s;t, who was transfigured before his di&s;ciples, <HI>and his face did &s;hine as the &s;un, and his raiment was white as the light, and behold! there appeared unto them Mo&s;es and Elias talking with him</HI>; Chri&s;t, at who&s;e death <HI>the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bot|tom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened, and many bodies of &s;aints, which &s;lept, aro&s;e, and came out of the graves after his re&s;urrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many</HI>; in conclu&s;ion, if Chri&s;t, who&s;e re&s;urrection was declared by angels, &s;een and acknowledged by many wit|ne&s;&s;es, and who&s;e a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven crowned and completed the irrefragable evidences of his divine mi&s;&s;ion; if Chri&s;t, who&s;e prophecies of his own death and re&s;urrection, of the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem and of the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;per&s;ion of the Jews, have been and now are &s;o fully verified, cannot, as our caviller a&s;&s;erts, meet the com|pari&s;on with Mo&s;es, then is the Redeemer of lo&s;t mankind a le&s;s &s;ublime and important cha|racter than the legi&s;lator of the Jews.</P>
<P>I have now attempted in the fir&s;t place to
<PB N="220" REF="227">
di&s;cover how far the world was illuminated by right rea&s;on before the revelation of Chri&s;t took place; for had men's belief been &s;uch, and their practice al&s;o &s;uch as Chri&s;tianity teaches, the world had not &s;tood in need of a Redeemer.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of this enquiry was, that certain per&s;ons have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves well and ju&s;tly upon the &s;ubject of God and religion in times antecedent to the Chri&s;tian aera, and in countries where idolatry was the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip:</P>
<P>That the nation of the Jews was a peculiar nation, and pre&s;erved the wor&s;hip of the true and only God, revealed in very early time to their fathers, but that this wor&s;hip from various cir|cum&s;tances and events, in which they them|&s;elves were highly criminal, had not been pro|pagated beyond the limits of a &s;mall tract, and that the temple of Jeru&s;alem was the only church in the world, where God was wor&s;hip|ped, when Chri&s;t came upon earth:</P>
<P>That from the almo&s;t univer&s;al diffu&s;ion of idolatry, from the unworthy ideas men had of God and religion, and the few faint notions en|tertained among&s;t them of a future &s;tate of re|wards and puni&s;hments, the world was in &s;uch deplorable error, and in &s;uch univer&s;al need of

<P><HI>NED DROWSY</HI> came into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a good e&s;tate at a time of life, when the humours and habits contracted by education, or more properly by the want of it, become too much a part of the con&s;titution to be conquered but by &s;ome extraordinary effort or event. Ned's father had too tender a concern for his health and morals to admit him of a public &s;chool, and the &s;ame objections held again&s;t an univer&s;ity: Not that Ned was without his pre|ten&s;ions to &s;cholar&s;hip, for it is well known that
<PB N="223" REF="230">
he has been &s;ometimes found a&s;leep upon his couch with a book open in his hand, which warrants a pre&s;umption that he could read, though I have not met any body yet, who has detected him in the act it&s;elf. The literature of the nur&s;ery he held in general contempt, and had no more pa&s;&s;ion for the feats of <HI>Jack the Giant-killer,</HI> when he was a child, than he had for the labours of Hercules in his more adult years: I can witne&s;s to the dete&s;tation, in which he held the popular allegory of <HI>the Pilgrim's Progre&s;s,</HI> and when he has been told of the many editions that book has run through, he has never failed to reply, that there is no ac|counting for the bad ta&s;te of the vulgar: At the &s;ame time, I &s;peak it to his honour, I have fre|quently known him expre&s;s a tender fellow-feeling for <HI>the Sleeping Beauty in the Wood,</HI> and betray more partiality, than he was apt to be guilty of, to the edifying &s;tory of <HI>the Seven Dreamers,</HI> whom I verily believe he held in more re&s;pect than the Seven Wonders of the World.</P>
<P>Rural &s;ports were too boi&s;terous for Ned's &s;pirits; neither hares nor partridges could lay their deaths at his door, &s;o that all his country neighbours gave him their good word, and poached his manors without mercy: There was
<PB N="224" REF="231">
a canal in front of his hou&s;e, where he would &s;ometimes take up with the placid amu&s;ement of angling from an alcove by the &s;ide of it, with a &s;ervant in attendance for the purpo&s;e of baiting his hook, or calling upon him to pull, if by chance he was &s;urprized with a bite; happily for his repo&s;e this very rarely was the ca&s;e, though a tradition runs in the family of his having once &s;napped an officious perch of extraordinary &s;ize.</P>
<P>There was a learned practitioner in the law, one <HI>Mr. Driver,</HI> who had a hou&s;e in his pari&s;h, and him Ned appointed manager of his e&s;tate; this worthy gentleman was &s;o con&s;iderate as &s;el|dom if ever to give him any trouble about his accounts, well knowing his aver&s;ion from items and particulars and the little turn he had to the drudgery of arithmetic and calculations. By the kind offices of Mr. Driver Ned was relieved from an infinite deal of di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s, and Mr. Driver him&s;elf &s;uddenly became a man of con&s;iderable property, and began to take a lead in the county. Ned together with his e&s;tate had &s;ucceeded to a Chancery &s;uit, which was pending at the death of the late po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: This &s;uit was for a time carried on &s;o pro&s;pe|rou&s;ly by Mr. Driver, that nothing more &s;eemed requi&s;ite to bring it to a favorable i&s;&s;ue, than for Ned to make his appearance in Court for &s;ome
<PB N="225" REF="232">
purpo&s;es I am not able to explain: This was an undertaking &s;o in&s;urmountable, that he could never be prevailed upon to &s;et about it and the &s;uit was de&s;erted accordingly. This &s;uit and the circum&s;tance of a copper mine on his e&s;tate, which his agent never could engage him to work, were the only things that ever di&s;turbed his tranquillity, and upon the&s;e topics he was rather &s;ore, till Mr. Driver found it convenient to give up both points, and Ned heard no more of his Chancery &s;uit or his copper mine.</P>
<P>The&s;e few traits of my friend's character will &s;uffice to make my readers acquainted with him before I relate the particulars of a vi&s;it I paid him about three months ago. It was in com|pliance with the following letter, which I was favoured with from Mr. Driver.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The&s;e are to inform you that Mr. Drow&s;y de&s;ires the favour of your company at Poppy-Hall, which he has ordered me to notify to you, not doubting but you will take it in good part, as you well know how his humour &s;tands towards writing. He bids me &s;ay that he has &s;omething of con&s;equence to con&s;ult you upon, of which more when we meet:
<PB N="226" REF="233">
Wi&s;hing you health and a &s;afe journey I re|main in all rea&s;onable &s;ervice,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your's to command, DANIEL DRIVER.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>In con&s;equence of this &s;ummons I &s;et off for Poppy-Hall, and arrived there early in the even|ing of the &s;econd day. I found my friend Drow&s;y in company with my corre&s;pondent the attorney, the reverend Mr. Beetle curate of the pari&s;h, and two gentlemen, &s;trangers to me, who, as I under&s;tood from Mr. Driver, were Mr. Sparkle &s;enior, an eminent auctioneer in London, and Billy Sparkle his &s;on, a city beau. My friend was in his ea&s;y chair turned towards the fire; the re&s;t were &s;itting round the table at &s;ome di&s;tance, and engaged, as I &s;oon di&s;co|vered, in a very intere&s;ting conver&s;ation upon beauty, which my entrance for a while put a &s;top to. This intermi&s;&s;ion however la&s;ted no longer than whil&s;t Mr. Drow&s;y paid his compli|ments to me, which he performed in few words, a&s;king me however if I came on hor&s;eback, which having an&s;wered in the affirmative, he &s;ententiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, that he never rode. And now the elder Mr. Sparkle re&s;umed the conver|&s;ation in the following manner&mdash;What I was
<PB N="227" REF="234">
going to ob&s;erve to you, when this gentleman came in, upon the article of beauty is peremp|torily and preci&s;ely this: Beauty, gentlemen, is in the eye, I aver it to be in the eye of the be|holder and not in the object it&s;elf; my beauty for in&s;tance is not your beauty, your's is not mine; it depends upon fancy and ta&s;te, fancy and ta&s;te are nothing but caprice: A collection of fine women is like a collection of fine pic|tures; put them up to auction, and bidders will be found for every lot.&mdash;But all bidders, cries the attorney, are not <HI>bon&acirc; fide</HI> buyers; I believe you find many an article in your &s;ales &s;ent back upon the owner's hands, and &s;o it is with beauty; all, that is bidden for, is not bought in&mdash;Here the curate interpo&s;ed, and turning to his lay-brother of the pulpit, reminded him that beauty was like a flower of the field; here to-day, and gone to|morrow; whereas virtue was a hardy plant and defied the &s;cythe of time; virtue was an ever|green and would bloom in the winter of life; virtue would flouri&s;h, when beauty was no more.&mdash;I believe it &s;eldom makes any con&s;iderable &s;hoots till that is the ca&s;e, cried Billy Sparkle, and followed up his repartee with a laugh, in which he was him&s;elf the only performer.&mdash;It is high time now, &s;ays the attorney, directing his di&s;cour&s;e to me, to make you acquainted with
<PB N="228" REF="235">
the bu&s;ine&s;s we are upon, and how we came to fall upon this topic of beauty. Your friend Mr. Drow&s;y does not like the trouble of talking, and therefore with his leave I &s;hall open the ca&s;e to you, as I know he wi&s;hes to take your opinion upon it&mdash;Here the attorney &s;eeming to pau&s;e for his cue, Drow&s;y nodded his head and bade him go on. We are in con&s;ultation, rejoined he, upon a matter of no le&s;s moment than the choice of a wife for the gentleman in that ea&s;y chair.&mdash;And if he is ea&s;y in it, demanded I, what need he wi&s;h for more?&mdash;Alackaday! he has no heir, and till that event takes place, he is only tenant for life &s;ubject to empeachment of wa&s;te; he cannot be called ma&s;ter of his own e&s;tate; only think of that, Sir. That was for him to do, I replied; how does Mr. Drow&s;y him&s;elf think of it? I don't think much about it, an&s;wered Ned. And how &s;tands your mind towards ma|trimony?&mdash;No an&s;wer.&mdash;There's trouble in it, added I. There is &s;o, replied he with a &s;igh; but Driver &s;ays I want an heir. There's trou|ble in that too, quoth I; have you any particu|lar lady in your eye? That is the very point we are now upon, cried Mr. Sparkle &s;enior; there are three lots up for Mr. Drow&s;y or his friends to chu&s;e from, and I only wait his &s;ignal for knocking down the lot, that he likes be&s;t.
<PB N="229" REF="236">
This I could not perfectly under&s;tand in the terms of art, which Mr. Sparkle made u&s;e of, and therefore de&s;ired he would expre&s;s him&s;elf in plain language. My father means to &s;ay, cries Billy, there are three girls want hu&s;bands, and but one man that wi&s;hes to be married. Hold your tongue, puppy, &s;aid old Sparkle, and pro|ceeded. You &s;hall know, Sir, that to accom|modate Mr. Drow&s;y in the article of a wife and &s;ave him the trouble of looking out for him&s;elf, we &s;ome time ago put an adverti&s;ement in the papers; I believe I have a copy of it about me: Aye, here it is!</P>
<Q><P>WANTED</P>
<P>A young, healthy, unmarried woman, of a di&s;creet character, as wife to a gentleman of fortune, who loves his ea&s;e and does not care to take upon him&s;elf the trouble of court&s;hip: &s;he mu&s;t be of a placid dome&s;tic turn, and not one that likes to hear her&s;elf talk. Any qualified per&s;on, whom this may &s;uit, by ap|plying to Mr. Sparkle auctioneer, may be in|formed of particulars. A &s;hort trial will be expected.</P>
<P>N. B. Maids of Honor need not apply, as none &s;uch will be treated with.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="230" REF="237">I told Mr. Sparkle I thought his adverti&s;e|ment a very good one, and properly guarded and I wi&s;hed to know the re&s;ult of it: He &s;aid that very many applicants had pre&s;ented them&s;elves, but for want of full credentials he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all but three, whom I will again de&s;cribe, added he, not only for your information, but in hopes Mr. Drow&s;y will give &s;ome attention to the ca|talogue, which I am &s;orry to &s;ay has not yet been the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>He then drew a paper of minutes from his pocket-book and read as follows&mdash;</P>
<Q>Katherine Cumming, &s;pin&s;ter, aged twen|ty-five, lodges at Grave&s;end in the hou&s;e of Mr. Duffer, a reputable &s;lop-&s;eller of that place, can have an undeniable character from two gentlemen of credit, now ab&s;ent, but &s;oon expected in the next arrivals from China: Her fortune, which &s;he ingenuou&s;ly owns is not capital, is for the pre&s;ent inve&s;ted in cer|tain commodities, which &s;he has put into the hands of the gentlemen above-mentioned, and for which &s;he expects profitable returns on their arrival. This young lady appeared with a florid blooming complexion, fine long ring|lets of dark hair in the fa&s;hionable di&s;hevel, eyes uncommonly &s;parkling, is tall of &s;tature, &s;trait and in good ca&s;e. She wore a locket of
<PB N="231" REF="238">
plaited hair &s;lung in a gold chain round her neck, and was remarkably neat and elegant about the feet and ancles: Is impatient for a &s;peedy an&s;wer, as &s;he has thoughts of going out in the next &s;hips to India.</Q>
<P>Let her go! cried Ned, I'll have nothing to &s;ay to Kitty Cumming.&mdash;I'll bet a wager &s;he is one of us, exclaimed the city beau, for which his father gave him a look of rebuke and pro|ceeded to the next.</P>
<Q>Agnes de Crapeau, daughter of a French prote&s;tant clergyman in the I&s;le of Jer&s;ey, a comely young woman, but of a pen&s;ive air and downca&s;t look; lived as a dependant upon a certain rich trader's wife, with whom her &s;ituation was very unplea&s;ant; flattered her&s;elf &s;he was well practi&s;ed in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience, &s;hould conform to any hu|mours which the adverti&s;er might have, and, &s;hould he do her the honour to accept her as his wife, &s;he would do <HI>her po&s;&s;ible</HI> to plea&s;e him with all humble duty, gratitude and de|votion.</Q>
<P>Ned Drow&s;y now turned him&s;elf in his chair, and with a &s;igh whi&s;pered me in the ear, Poor thing! I pity her, but &s;he won't do: Go on to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The lady I am next to de&s;cribe, &s;aid Sparkle,
<PB N="232" REF="239">
is one of whom I can only &s;peak by report, for as yet I have not &s;et eyes on her per&s;on, nor is &s;he acquainted with a &s;yllable of the&s;e proceed|ings, being repre&s;ented to me as a young wo|man, who&s;e delicacy would not &s;ubmit to be the candidate of an adverti&s;ement. The account I have had of her is from a friend, who, though a man of a particular way of thinking, is a very hone&s;t honourable per&s;on, and one who&s;e word will pa&s;s for thou&s;ands: He called at my office one day, when this adverti&s;ement was lying on my de&s;k, and ca&s;ting his eye upon the paper a&s;ked me, if that &s;illy je&s;t was of my inventing; I a&s;&s;ured him it was no je&s;t, but a &s;erious adver|ti&s;ement; that the party was a man of property and honor, a gentleman by birth and principle, and one every way qualified to make the mar|ried &s;tate happy. Hath he lo&s;t his under&s;tand|ing, &s;aid my friend, that he takes this method of convening all the pro&s;titutes about the town, or doth he con&s;ult his ea&s;e &s;o much, as not trouble him&s;elf whether his wife be a mode&s;t woman or not? Humph! cried Ned, what &s;ignifies what he &s;aid? go on with your &s;tory. To make &s;hort of it then, re&s;umed Sparkle, my friend grew &s;erious upon the matter, and after a con&s;i|dering time addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me as follows; If I were &s;atisfied your principal is a man, as
<PB N="233" REF="240">
you de&s;cribe him, qualified by temper and di&s;|po&s;ition to make an amiable and virtuous girl happy, I would &s;ay &s;omething to you on the &s;ub|ject; but as he chu&s;es to be concealed, and as I cannot think of blindly &s;acrificing my fair charge to any man, whom &s;he does not know and ap|prove, there is an end of the matter. And why &s;o? exclaimed Ned with more energy than I had ever ob&s;erved in him; I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee the gentleman and lady both; I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee them.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant a &s;ervant entered the room and announced the arrival of a &s;tranger, who wi&s;hed to &s;peak with the elder Mr. Sparkle.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="119" TYPE="essay">
<PB N="234" REF="241">
<HEAD>N^o CXIX.</HEAD>
<P>MY friend Ned Drow&s;y is a man, who hath indeed neglected nature's gifts, but not abu&s;ed them; he is as void of vice, as he is of indu&s;try, his temper is &s;erene, and his man|ners harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive; he is avaricious of nothing but of his ea&s;e, and certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es benevolence, though too indolent to put it into action: He is as &s;paring of his teeth as he is of his tongue, and whether it be that he is naturally temperate, or that eating and drinking are too trouble&s;ome, &s;o it is that he is very ab&s;temious in both particulars, and having received the ble&s;&s;ings of a good con&s;titution and a comely per&s;on from the hand of Providence, he has not &s;quandered his talent, though he has not put it out to u&s;e.</P>
<P>Accordingly when I perceived him intere&s;ted in the manner I have related upon Mr. Sparkle's di&s;cour&s;e, and heard him give orders to his &s;er|vant to &s;hew the gentleman into the room, which he did in a quicker and more &s;pirited tone than is u&s;ual with him, I began to think that nature was about to &s;truggle for her pri|vileges,
<PB N="235" REF="242">
and &s;u&s;pecting that this &s;tranger might perhaps have &s;ome connection with Sparkle's <HI>incognita,</HI> I grew impatient for his appearance.</P>
<P>After a while the &s;ervant returned and intro|duced a little &s;warthy old man with &s;hort grey hair and whim&s;ically dre&s;&s;ed; having on a dark brown coat with a tarni&s;hed gold edging, black figured velvet wai&s;tcoat and breeches of &s;carlet cloth with long gold knee-bands, dangling down a pair of black &s;ilk &s;tockings, which cloathed two legs not exactly ca&s;t in the mould of the Belvedere Apollo. He made two or three low reverences as he advanced, &s;o that before Mr. Sparkle could announce him by name, I had &s;et him down for an I&s;raelite, all the world to no|thing; but as &s;oon as I heard the words, <HI>Gentle|men, this is my worthy friend Mr. Abraham Abra|hams!</HI> I recognized the per&s;on of my corre&s;pon|dent, who&s;e humble and ingenuous letter I thought fit to publi&s;h in N^o LXIV. of my third volume, and whom I had once before had a glimp&s;e of as he walked pa&s;t my book&s;eller's door in Cornhill, and was pointed out to me from the &s;hop.</P>
<P>Mr. Abrahams, not being a per&s;on, to whom nature had affixed her pa&s;&s;port, &s;aying <HI>Let this man have free ingre&s;s and egre&s;s upon my authority,</HI> made his fir&s;t approaches with all tho&s;e civil
<PB N="236" REF="243">
a&s;&s;iduities, which &s;ome people are con&s;trained to practi&s;e, who mu&s;t fir&s;t turn prejudice out of company, before they can &s;it down in it. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e I flatter my&s;elf he fared &s;ome|what better for the whi&s;per I gave my friend Ned in his favor, and &s;ilence after a &s;hort time having taken place in &s;uch a manner as &s;eemed to indicate an expectation in the company, that he was the per&s;on who was now to break it, he began not without &s;ome he&s;itation to deliver him&s;elf in the&s;e words.</P>
<P>Before I take the liberty of addre&s;&s;ing the gentleman of the hou&s;e, I wi&s;h to know from my friend Mr. Sparkle, whether he has opened any hint of what has pa&s;&s;ed between him and me relative to a certain adverti&s;ement; and if he has, I &s;hould next be glad to know, whether I have permi&s;&s;ion of the party concerned to go into the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, cried Ned &s;omewhat eagerly, Mr. Sparkle has told me all that pa&s;&s;ed, and you have not only my free leave, but my earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ay every thing you think fit before the&s;e friends. Then, Sir, &s;aid Abrahams, I &s;hall tell you a plain tale without varying a &s;ingle tittle from the truth.</P>
<P>As I was coming home from my club pretty late in the evening about five months ago, in
<PB N="237" REF="244">
turning the corner of a narrow alley, a young woman came ha&s;tily out of the door of a hou&s;e, and, &s;eizing hold of my hand, eagerly be&s;ought me for the love of God to follow her. I was &s;tartled, and knew not what to think of &s;uch a greeting; I could di&s;cern that &s;he was young and beautiful, and I was no adventurer in affairs of gallantry; &s;he &s;eemed indeed to be exceed|ingly agitated and almo&s;t be&s;ide her&s;elf, but I knew the profligate of that &s;ex can &s;ometimes feign di&s;tre&s;s for very wicked purpo&s;es, and therefore de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from going into any hou&s;e with her; if &s;he would however ad|vance a few paces I would hear what &s;he had to &s;ay, and &s;o it was nothing but my charity &s;he &s;olicited, I was ready to relieve her: We turned the corner of the alley together, and being now in one of the principal &s;treets of the city, I thought I might &s;afely &s;top and hear the petition &s;he had to make. As we &s;tood together under the eaves of a &s;hop, the night being rainy, &s;he told me that the rea&s;on &s;he be&s;ought me to go into the hou&s;e with her was in hopes the &s;pec|tacle of di&s;tre&s;s, which would there pre&s;ent it|&s;elf to my &s;ight, might, if there was any pity in my heart, call it forth, and prevail with me to &s;top a deed of cruelty, which was then in exe|cution, by &s;aying a wretched object from being
<PB N="238" REF="245">
thru&s;t into the &s;treets in a dying condition for a &s;mall debt to her landlord, whom no entreaties could pacify. Ble&s;&s;ed God! I exclaimed, can there be &s;uch human mon&s;ters? who is the wo|man? My mother, replied &s;he, and bur&s;t into an agony of tears; if I would be what I may have appeared to you, but what I never can be even to &s;ave the life of my parent, I had not been driven to this extremity, for it is re&s;ent|ment, which actuates the brutal wretch no le&s;s than cruelty. Though I confe&s;s my&s;elf not in|&s;en&s;ible to fear, being as you &s;ee no athletic, I felt &s;uch indignation ri&s;e within me at the&s;e words, that I did not he&s;itate for another mo|ment about accompanying this unhappy girl to her hou&s;e, not doubting the truth of what &s;he had been telling me, as well from the manner of her relating it, as from my ob&s;ervation of her countenance, which the light of the lamp under which we were &s;tanding, di&s;covered to be of a mo&s;t affecting, mode&s;t and even dignified cha|racter&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir, I honor you for your benevolence, cried Ned; pray proceed with your &s;tory.</P>
<P>She led me up two pair of &s;tairs into a back apartment, where a woman was in bed, plead|ing for mercy to a &s;urly-looking fellow, who was calling out to her to get up and be gone out
<PB N="239" REF="246">
of his hou&s;e. I have found a fellow-creature, &s;aid my conductre&s;s, who&s;e pity will redeem us from the clutches of one, who has none; be comforted, my dear mother, for this gentleman has &s;ome Chri&s;tian charity in his heart. I don't know what charity may be in his heart, cried the fellow, but he has &s;o little of the Chri&s;tian in his countenance, that I'll bet ten to one he is a Jew. Be that as it may, &s;aid I, a Jew may have feeling, and therefore &s;ay what the&s;e poor women are indebted to you, and I will pay down the money, if my pocket can reach it; if not, I believe my name, though it be a Jew's name, will be good for the &s;um, let it be what it will. May God reward you, cried the mother, our debt is not great, though it is more than we have pre&s;ent means to pay; we owe but &s;ix and twenty &s;hillings to our hardened creditor; I be|lieve I am right, Con&s;tantia, (turning to her daughter) but you know what it is correctly. That is the amount of it, replied the lovely Con|&s;tantia, for &s;uch &s;he now appeared to me, as &s;he was in the act of &s;upporting her mother on the bol&s;ter with her arm under her neck. Take your money, man, quoth I, receive what is your own, and let the&s;e helple&s;s creatures lodge in peace one night beneath your roof; to-morrow I will remove them, if this infirm woman &s;hall
<PB N="240" REF="247">
be able to endure it. I hope my hou&s;e is my own, an&s;wered the &s;avage, and I don't de&s;ire to be troubled with them one night longer, no, nor even one hour.</P>
<P>Is this po&s;&s;ible? exclaimed Ned; are there &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;es in the world? what then have I been doing all this while? Having &s;o &s;aid, he &s;prung nimbly out of his ea&s;y chair, took a ha&s;ty &s;tride or two acro&s;s the room, rubbing his fore|head as he walked, threw him&s;elf into an empty chair, which &s;tood next to that, in which Mr. Abrahams was &s;itting, and begged him once more to proceed with his narrative.</P>
<P>With the help of my apothecary, who lived in the very hou&s;e, at the door of which I had conver&s;ed with Con&s;tantia, I removed the invalid and her daughter that very evening in a hackney coach to my own hou&s;e, which was not far di&s;tant; and by the &s;ame medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance and my wife's care, who is an excellent nur&s;e, I had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee the poor woman regain her health and &s;trength very &s;peedily, for in fact her weakne&s;s had been more the effect of mi&s;ery and want of diet, than any real di&s;ea&s;e: As for Con&s;tantia, her looks kept pace with her mo|ther's recovery, and I mu&s;t &s;ay without flattery &s;he is altogether the fine&s;t creature I ever looked upon.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="248">The mother of Con&s;tantia is &s;till a very comely woman and not above forty years old; &s;he has a father living, who is a man of great opulence, but he has conceived &s;uch irrecon|cileable di&s;plea&s;ure at her marrying, that he has never &s;ince that event taken the lea&s;t notice ei|ther of her or of his grandchild. Then he is an unnatural mon&s;ter, cried Ned, and will be &s;ent to the devil for his barbarity.</P>
<P>Mr. Abrahams proceeded as follows; &s;he is the widow of a Captain Goodi&s;on, of who&s;e un|happy &s;tory I have at different times collected only a few particulars, but from the&s;e I can un|der&s;tand that &s;he went with him to America, and took her daughter with her; that he had a com|pany of foot, and little el&s;e to maintain him&s;elf and family upon but his pay; that he &s;erved there in mo&s;t of the campaigns with the repu|tation of a gallant officer, but that the &s;pirit of gaming having been &s;uffered to infect the Engli&s;h army in their winter quarters at New-York, this wretched man, the father and the hu&s;band of the&s;e helple&s;s women, became a prey to that in|fernal pa&s;&s;ion, and being driven to &s;ell his com|mi&s;&s;ion to pay his lo&s;&s;es at play, put an end to his mi&s;erable exi&s;tence by a bullet.</P>
<P>Here Abrahams pau&s;ed, whil&s;t Ned gave vent to a groan, in which I can an&s;wer for his being
<PB N="242" REF="249">
&s;econded by one more heart at lea&s;t then in com|pany, from which the recollection of that fatal period never fails to extort a pang.</P>
<P>The &s;eries of &s;ufferings, which the unhappy widow and her child endured, (continued Abra|hams) from this tragical period, were &s;uch as I mu&s;t leave you to imagine, for I neither wi&s;hed to be informed of them, nor could &s;he expatiate upon them. It may however be proper to in|form Mr. Drow&s;y, that I am convinced there is no room for hope, that any future impre&s;&s;ion can be made upon the unforgiving nature of Con|&s;tantia's grandfather, and it would be unju&s;t in me to repre&s;ent her as any other than what &s;he is, de&s;titute of fortune even in expectancy. And what is &s;he the wor&s;e for that? cried Ned; among&s;t the articles I &s;tipulate for in the adver|ti&s;ement, which Mr. Sparkle has been reading, I believe you will not find that money is put down for one. Upon this Mr. Abrahams made a proper compliment to my friend, and addre&s;&s;|ing him&s;elf to the company began to apologize for having taken up &s;o much of our attention by his long di&s;cour&s;e; this naturally produced a re|turn of acknowledgments on our parts, with many and ju&s;t commendations of his benevo|lence. The hone&s;t man's features brightened with joy upon receiving this welcome te&s;timony,

<P>Charity, Mr. Abrahams, is by our church e&s;teemed the fir&s;t of Chri&s;tian virtues, and as we are commanded to pray even for our enemies, in obedience to that ble&s;&s;ed mandate I devoutly pray that in your in&s;tance it may avail to cover and blot out the multitude of &s;ins. Your reach|ing forth the hand of mercy to the&s;e poor Chri&s;tians in their pitiable di&s;tre&s;s proves you to be a man &s;uperior to tho&s;e &s;hameful prejudices, which make a fal&s;e plea of religion for &s;hutting up the heart again&s;t all, but tho&s;e of it's own faith and per&s;ua&s;ion.

I al&s;o remarked the mode&s;t manner of your &s;peaking, when you unavoidably reported of your own good deeds; you &s;ounded no trum|pet before you, and thereby convinced me you are not of that phari&s;aical leaven, which &s;eeketh the prai&s;e of men; and let me tell you, Sir, it is the very te&s;t of true charity, that it vaunteth not it&s;elf, is not puffed up. Humility, Mr. Abra|hams, in a peculiar degree is expected of you, as of one of the children of wrath, &s;cattered over the face of the earth without an abiding place, which you may call your own: Charity al&s;o is in you a duty of more than ordinary obligation, for you and your's &s;ub&s;i&s;t no otherwi&s;e than on the charity of the nations, who give you &s;helter: The alms of others may be termed a free gift of love, but your alms are in fact a legal tribute for protection. To conclude&mdash;I exhort you to take in good part what I have now been &s;aying; you are the fir&s;t of your nation I ever communed with, and if hereafter in the execution of my duty I am led to &s;peak with rigour of your &s;tiff|necked generation, I &s;hall make a mental excep|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">on in your favour, and recommend you in my prayers for all Jews, Turks, infidels and heretics by a &s;eparate ejaculation in your behalf.</P>

there was nothing to be ob&s;erved in his counte|nance, which be&s;poke any other emotions than tho&s;e of benevolence and good-nature. My friend Drow&s;y was not quite &s;o placid at certain periods of the di&s;cour&s;e, and when he found that the humble I&s;raelite made no other return, but by a civil inclination of the head to the &s;peaker at the conclu&s;ion of the harangue, he &s;aid to Abrahams in a qualifying tone of voice, Mr. Beetle, Sir, means well; to which the other in|&s;tantly replied, that he did not doubt it, and then with a de&s;ign, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to turn the di&s;|cour&s;e, informed Ned, that he had taken the li|berty of going in per&s;on to the father of Mrs. Goodi&s;on, in hopes he would have allowed him to &s;peak of the &s;ituation, in which he had found his daughter and her child; but alas! added he, I had no &s;ooner began to open the bu&s;ine&s;s upon which I came, than he in&s;tantly &s;topt my mouth by demanding, if I came into his hou&s;e to affront him? that he was a&s;toni&s;hed at my a&s;&s;urance for daring to name his daughter in his hearing, and in the &s;ame breath in a very haughty tone cried out, Harkye, Sir! are not you a Jew? to which I had no &s;ooner replied in the affirmative, than ringing his bell very violently, he called out to his footman, to put that Jew out of his doors.</P>

<P>AFTER the conver&s;ation related in the preceding chapter, Drow&s;y and his gue&s;ts pa&s;&s;ed a &s;ocial evening, and hone&s;t Abrahams was prevailed upon to take a bed at Poppy Hall. The next morning early, as I was walking in the garden, I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find Ned there before me&mdash;I dare &s;ay you wonder, &s;aid he, what could provoke my lazine&s;s to quit my pillow thus early, but I am re&s;olved to &s;hake off a &s;lothful habit, which till our di&s;cour&s;e la&s;t night I never con&s;idered as criminal. I have been thinking over all that Mr. Abrahams told us about the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed widow and her daughter, and I mu&s;t own to you I have a longing de&s;ire to obtain a &s;ight of this Con&s;tantia, whom he de&s;cribes to be &s;o charming in mind and per&s;on.
<PB N="247" REF="254">
Now I don't know with what face I can invite her hither; be&s;ides I con&s;ider, though I might prevail upon Mr. Abrahams to bring her, yet I &s;hould be confoundedly hampered how to get hand&s;omely off, if upon acquaintance it did not &s;uit me to propo&s;e for her.</P>
<P>You judge rightly, &s;aid I, your dilemma would be embarra&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Well then, quoth he, there is no alternative but for me to go to her, and though I am aware of the trouble it will give me to take a journey to London, where I have never been and &s;hall probably make a very awkward figure, yet if you will encourage me &s;o far as to &s;ay you will take a corner in my coach thither, and Mr. Abrahams does not object to the &s;cheme, I will even pluck up a good courage and &s;et out to|morrow.</P>
<P>Be it &s;o! an&s;wered I, if Mr. Abrahams ap|proves of it, I have no objection to the party.</P>
<P>On the morrow we &s;et off; Abrahams and my&s;elf with Ned and his old &s;ervant in his coach for London, and in the evening of the &s;econd day our po&s;t-boys delivered us &s;afe at Blo&s;&s;om's Inn in Lawrence-Lane. Abrahams procured us lodgings at the hou&s;e of his apothecary in the Poultry, where he fir&s;t &s;heltered Mrs. Goodi&s;on and Con&s;tantia; and having &s;ettled this affair
<PB N="248" REF="255">
the good man ha&s;tened home to pre&s;ent him&s;elf to his family, and prepare for our &s;upping at his hou&s;e that night.</P>
<P>My friend Ned had been in a broad &s;tare of amazement ever &s;ince his entry into London; he &s;eemed anxious to know what all the people were about, and why they po&s;ted up and down in &s;uch a hurry; he frequently a&s;ked me when they would go home and be quiet; for his own part he doubted if he &s;hould get a wink of &s;leep till he was fairly cut of this noi&s;y town.</P>
<P>As he was fea&s;ting his curio&s;ity from the win|dow of our lodgings, the Lord Mayor pa&s;&s;ed by in his &s;tate coach towards the Man&s;ion Hou&s;e&mdash;God ble&s;s his Maje&s;ty! cried Ned, he is a portly man. He was rather di&s;appointed when I &s;et him right in his mi&s;take; but neverthele&s;s the &s;pectacle plea&s;ed him, and he commented very gravely upon the commodious &s;ize of the coach and the &s;low pace of the proce&s;&s;ion, which he &s;aid &s;hewed the good &s;en&s;e and di&s;cretion of the city magi&s;trate, and ob&s;erving him to be a very corpulent man, added with an air of &s;ome con&s;equence, that he would venture to pro|nounce my Lord Mayor of London was a wi&s;e man and con&s;ulted his own ea&s;e.</P>
<P>We now were to &s;et our&s;elves in order for our vi&s;it to hone&s;t Abrahams, and Ned began to
<PB N="249" REF="256">
&s;hew &s;ome anxiety about certain articles of his dre&s;s and appearance, which did not exactly tally with the &s;pruce air of the city &s;parks, whom he had reconnoitred in the &s;treets: The whole was confe&s;&s;edly of the ru&s;tic order, but I encouraged him to put his tru&s;t in broad-cloth and country bloom, and &s;eriou&s;ly exhorted him not to tru&s;t his head to the &s;heers of a London hair-dre&s;&s;er. I now ordered a coach to be called, which was no &s;ooner announced than Ned ob&s;erved it was &s;peedily got ready; but they do every thing in a hurry in this place, added he, and I wi&s;h to my heart the fat gentleman in the fine coach may order all the people to bed before our return, that I may &s;tand &s;ome chance of getting a little re&s;t and quiet among&s;t them.</P>
<P>We now &s;tept into our hack, but not without a caution from Ned to the coachman to drive gently over the &s;tones, which, to give him his due, he faithfully performed. We were received at the door by our friendly I&s;raelite with a &s;mil|ing welcome, and conducted by him up &s;tairs to a plain but neat apartment, in which was the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, an elderly decent matron, who pre&s;ented us to Mrs. Goodi&s;on, the mother of Con&s;tantia, in who&s;e countenance, though pale and overca&s;t with melancholy, beauty and mode&s;t dignity &s;till kept their native po&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="257">Hone&s;t Ned made his fir&s;t approaches with a bow, which Ve&s;tris perhaps could have mended, though it was of nature's workman&s;hip; and this he &s;toutly followed up with a ki&s;s to each lady, after the cu&s;tom of the country, that loudly &s;poke it's own good report.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e antient and exploded ceremonies were in operation, the door opened, and pre|&s;ented to our eyes&mdash;a wonder! It was a com|bination of grace and beauty to have extorted raptures from old age it&s;elf; it was a form of mode&s;ty to have awed the pa&s;&s;ions of licentious youth; it was in one word, Con&s;tantia her&s;elf, and till our reigning beauties &s;hall to equal charms add equal humility, and pre&s;ent them|&s;elves like her to the beholder's eye without one con&s;cious glance of exultation at their triumphs, &s;he mu&s;t remain no otherwi&s;e de&s;cribed than as that name be&s;peaks the unrivalled model of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>As for my friend Ned, who had acquitted him&s;elf &s;o dexterou&s;ly with the elder ladies, his lips had done their office; neither voice nor motion remained with them, and a&s;toni&s;hment would not even &s;uffer them to clo&s;e&mdash;

<P>And what after all were the mighty in&s;tru|ments,
<PB N="251" REF="258">
by which the&s;e effects were produced? Hearken, <HI>O Tavi&s;tock-&s;treet,</HI> and believe it if you can! The &s;imple&s;t dre&s;s, which mode&s;ty could clothe it&s;elf with, was all the armour, which this conqueror had put on; a plain white cotton ve&s;t with a clo&s;e head-dre&s;s, (&s;uch as your very windows would have blu&s;hed to have exhi|bited) filleted with a black &s;ilk ribband, were all the aids, that Nature borrowed to attire her matchle&s;s piece of work.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he &s;tood before us and there &s;he might have &s;tood for us till now, if the compa&s;&s;ionate I&s;raelite had not again &s;tepped in to her re&s;cue: He led her to a chair, and, taking his &s;eat, &s;et the conver&s;ation afloat by telling her of his vi&s;it to the worthy gentleman then pre&s;ent (as his body indeed might witne&s;s, but for his &s;en&s;es they were el&s;ewhere) &s;poke hand&s;omely of his kind reception, of the natural beauties of the place and the country about it, and concluded with &s;aying he had now the honour to introduce the owner of that ho&s;pitable man&s;ion to her ac|quaintance, and he flattered him&s;elf he could not do a more acceptable office to both parties.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer, which Con&s;tantia made to this elaborate harangue, would in vain be &s;ought for in <HI>the academy of compliments,</HI> for it con&s;i&s;ted &s;imply in the eloquence of two expre&s;&s;ive eyes,

which &s;he directed upon the &s;peechle&s;s trunk of poor Ned, &s;omewhere as I &s;hould gue&s;s about the region of his heart, for I am per&s;uaded her emi&s;|&s;aries never &s;topped till they made their way to the citadel and had audience there.</P>
<P>Ned now began to &s;tammer out a few &s;en|tences, by which, if Con&s;tantia did not under|&s;tand more than was expre&s;&s;ed, &s;he could not be much the wi&s;er for the information he gave her; he was glad and &s;orry twice or thrice in a breath, and not always in the right place; he hoped and believed and pre&s;umed to &s;ay&mdash;ju&s;t nothing at all; when in a moment the word Sup|per! announced through the no&s;e of a &s;nuffling Hebrew &s;ervant, came, as if it had been con|jured up by the wand of an enchanter, to deliver him out of his di&s;tre&s;s: The manna in the wil|derne&s;s was hardly more welcome to the fa|mi&s;hed Jews, than were now the bloodle&s;s vi|ands, that awaited us on the friendly board of Abrahams, to the ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s I &s;hould have &s;aid rather than to the appetite of Drow&s;y.</P>
<P>Love I know can do more in the way of me|tamorpho&s;is, than Ovid ever heard of; and to &s;ay the truth, what he had done to Ned was no trifling te&s;t of his art; for it was in fact no le&s;s a change, than if he had transformed Morpheus into Mercury: Good fellow&s;hip however can do

&s;omething in the &s;ame way, and the ho&s;pitable fe&s;tivity of the hone&s;t I&s;raelite now brought Ned's heart to his lips and &s;et it to work: Youth &s;oon catches the &s;ocial &s;ympathy, but even age and &s;orrow now threw a&s;ide their gloom, and paid their &s;ub&s;cription to the board with a good grace.

him, and I'll wager all I am worth, I will bring him round in a twinkling: Only let me have the proper credentials in my hand, do you &s;ee, and I'll do it. I know whom you point at, replied Mrs. Goodi&s;on, but I don't comprehend all your meaning; what credentials do you allude to? To the mo&s;t powerful, &s;aid Ned, that nature ever &s;et her hand to; the irre|&s;i&s;tible eyes of this young lady; might I only &s;ay&mdash;This angel is a &s;upplicant to you, the heart that would not melt mu&s;t be of marble.

I was a dull lazy blockhead and he did not keep me to my book. However &s;uch as I am, I know my own deficiencies, and I hope want of hone&s;ty and &s;incerity is not among&s;t the number. Nobody can &s;u&s;pect it, cried Abrahams.

Nobody can look in your's, Sir, an&s;wered &s;he, and expect to hear one; it is your unmerited genero&s;ity that &s;tops my tongue.

<P>I LEFT Con&s;tantia &s;omewhat abruptly in my la&s;t paper; and to &s;ay the truth rather in an awkward predicament; but as I do not like to interrupt young ladies in their blu&s;hes, I took occa&s;ion to call off the reader's attention from her, and be&s;towed it upon other ladies, who are not &s;ubject to the &s;ame embarra&s;&s;ments.</P>
<P>Our party &s;oon broke up after this event: Ned and I repaired to our apartments in the Poultry, Con&s;tantia to tho&s;e &s;lumbers, which purity in&s;pires, temperance endears and devotion ble&s;&s;es.</P>

<P>He took up the morning paper and the play|hou&s;e adverti&s;ements caught his eye: He began to que&s;tion me about <HI>The Clande&s;tine Marriage,</HI> which was up for the night at Drury Lane: Was it a comedy?

young man, and both parties at the clo&s;e of the fable were reconciled to their friends and made happy in each other: And is all this repre&s;ented on the &s;tage? cried Ned:&mdash;All this with many more incidents is acted on the &s;tage, and &s;o acted, let me a&s;&s;ure you, as leaves the merit of the performers only to be exceeded by that of the poet:&mdash;This is fine indeed! replied he; then as &s;ure as can be I will be there this very night, if you think they will admit a country clown like me.&mdash;There was no fear of that.&mdash;Very well then; is not this the play of all plays for Con&s;tantia?

<P>Away po&s;ted Ned&mdash;<HI>(quantum mutatus ab illo!)</HI> on the wings of love to Saint Mary Axe; what rhetoric he there made u&s;e of I cannot pretend to &s;ay, but certainly he came back with a decree in his favour for Mrs. Abrahams and Con&s;tantia to accompany him to the comedy, if I would un|dertake to convoy the party; for hone&s;t Abra|hams, (though a dear lover of the Mu&s;e, and as

<P>After an early dinner with Abrahams, we re|paired to the theatre, four in number, and whil&s;t the &s;econd mu&s;ic was playing po&s;ted our&s;elves with all due precaution on the third row of one of the front boxes, where places had been kept for us; Mrs. Abrahams on my left hand again&s;t the partition of the box, and Con&s;tantia on the other hand between her admirer and me.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething captivating in that bur&s;t of &s;plendor, &s;cenery, human beauty and fe&s;tivity, which a royal theatre di&s;plays to every &s;pectator on his entrance; what then mu&s;t have been the &s;troke on his optics, who never entered one be|fore? Ned looked about him with &s;urpri&s;e, and had there not been a central point of at|traction, to which his eyes were nece&s;&s;arily im|pelled by laws not le&s;s irre&s;i&s;tible than tho&s;e of gravitation, there might have been no &s;peedy &s;top to the eccentricity of their motions. It was not indeed one of tho&s;e delightfully crowded hou&s;es, which theatrical adverti&s;ers announce &s;o

rapturou&s;ly to draw &s;ucceeding audiences to the comforts of &s;ucceeding crowds, there to enjoy the peals of the loude&s;t plaudits and mo&s;t roar|ing bur&s;ts of laughter, be&s;towed upon the tricks of a harlequin or the gibberi&s;h of a buffoon; but it was a full a&s;&s;embly of rational beings, con|vened for the enjoyment of a rational entertain|ment, where the ears were not in danger of be|ing in&s;ulted by ribaldry, nor the under&s;tanding libelled by the &s;pectacle of folly.</P>
<P>Ned was charmed with the comedy, and &s;oon became deeply intere&s;ted for <HI>Lovewell</HI> and <HI>Fanny,</HI> on who&s;e di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation he made many na|tural remarks to his fair neighbour, and &s;he on her part be&s;towed more attention on the &s;cene, than was &s;trictly reconcileable to modern high|breeding. The repre&s;entative of <HI>Lord Ogleby</HI> put him into &s;ome alarm at fir&s;t, and he whi&s;pered in my ear, that he hoped the merry old gentle|man was not really &s;o ill as he &s;eemed to be;&mdash;for I am &s;ure, adds he, he would be the be&s;t actor in the world, was he to recover his health, &s;ince he can make &s;o good a &s;tand even at death's door. I put his heart to re&s;t by a&s;&s;uring him that his &s;ickne&s;s was all a fiction, and that the &s;ame old decrepid invalid, when he had wa&s;hed the wrinkles out of his face, was as gay and &s;prightly as the be&s;t, aye, added I, and in his
<PB N="263" REF="270">
real character one of the be&s;t into the bargain: I am glad of it, I am glad of it to my heart, an&s;wered Ned, I hope he will never have one half of the complaints, which he counterfeits; but 'tis &s;urpri&s;ing what &s;ome men can do.</P>
<P>In the interval of the &s;econd act an aged gen|tleman of a grave and &s;enatorial appearance, in a full-dre&s;&s;ed &s;uit of purple ratteen and a flowing white wig, entered the box alone, and as he was looking out for a &s;eat, it was with plea&s;ure I ob&s;erved the young idlers at the back pay re|&s;pect to his age and per&s;on by making way for him, and pointing to a &s;pare place on our bench, to which he advanced, and after &s;ome apologies natural to a well-bred man took his &s;eat on our range.</P>
<P>His eyes immediately paid the tribute, which even age could not withhold from the beauty of Con&s;tantia; he regarded her with more than a common degree of &s;en&s;ibility and attention; he watched for opportunities of &s;peaking to her every now and then at the &s;hifting of a &s;cene or the exit of a performer; he a&s;ked her opinion of the actors, of the comedy, and at the conclu|&s;ion of the act &s;aid to her, I dare believe, young lady, you are no friend to the title of this co|medy: I &s;hould be no friend to it, replied Con|&s;tantia, if the author had drawn &s;o unnatura a

character as an unrelenting father. One &s;uch mon&s;ter in an age, cried Ned, taking up the di&s;|cour&s;e, is one too many. When I overheard the&s;e words and noticed the effect, which they had upon him, combining it al&s;o with his emo|tion at certain times, when he examined the fea|tures of Con&s;tantia with a fixed attention, a thought aro&s;e in my mind of a romantic nature, which I kept to my&s;elf, that we might po&s;&s;ibly be then in company with the father of Mrs. Goodi&s;on and that Ned's prophetic wi&s;hes were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ctually verified. When <HI>Fanny</HI> is di&s;covered to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e a married woman at the clo&s;e of the comedy, and the father in his fury cries out to her hu&s;|band&mdash;<HI>Lovewell, you &s;hall leave my hou&s;e directly, and you &s;hall follow him, Madam</HI>&mdash;Ned could not refrain him&s;elf from exclaiming, Oh, the har|dened mon&s;ter!&mdash;but whil&s;t the words were on his lips, <HI>Lord Ogleby</HI> immediately replied to the father in the very words, which benevolence would have dictated&mdash;<HI>And if they do, I will re|ceive them into mine,</HI> whereupon the whole theatre gave a loud applau&s;e, and Con&s;tantia, whil&s;t the tear of &s;en&s;ibility and gratitude &s;tarted in her eye, taking advantage of the general noi&s;e to ad|dre&s;s her&s;elf to Ned without being overheard, remarked to him&mdash;That this was an effu&s;ion of genero&s;ity &s;he could not &s;cruple to applaud,
<PB N="265" REF="272">
&s;ince &s;he had an example in her eye, which con|vinced her it was in nature.&mdash;Pardon me, replied Ned, I find nothing in the &s;entiment to call for my applau&s;e; every man would act as <HI>Lora Ogleby</HI> does, but there is only one father living, who would play the part of that brute <HI>Sterling,</HI> and I wi&s;h old Goodi&s;on was here at my elbow to &s;ee the copy of his own hateful features. It was evident that the &s;tranger, who &s;at next to Ned, overheard this reply, for he gave a &s;udden &s;tart, which &s;hook his frame, and darting an angry glance &s;uddenly exclaimed&mdash;Sir!&mdash;and then as &s;uddenly recollecting him&s;elf, checked his &s;peech and bit his lips in &s;udden &s;ilence. This had pa&s;&s;ed without being ob&s;erved by Ned, who turning round at the word, which he con|ceived was addre&s;&s;ed to him, &s;aid in a mild tone&mdash;Did you &s;peak to me, Sir? to which the old gentleman making no an&s;wer, the matter pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed, except by me.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the comedy was over, our box began to empty it&s;elf into the lobby, when the &s;tranger &s;eeing the bench unoccupied behind me, left his place and planted him&s;elf at my back. I was now more than ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the idea of his being old Goodi&s;on, and wi&s;hed to a&s;certain if po&s;&s;ible the certainty of my gue&s;s; I therefore made a pretence to the
<PB N="266" REF="273">
ladies of giving them more room and &s;tept back to the bench on which he was &s;itting. After a few words in the way of apology he a&s;ked me, if he might without offence reque&s;t the name of the young lady I had ju&s;t quitted; with this I readily complied, and when I gave her name methought he &s;eemed prepared to expect it: He a&s;ked me if her mother was a widow; I told him &s;he was&mdash;Where was &s;he at pre&s;ent and in what condition? She was at pre&s;ent in the hou&s;e of a mo&s;t benevolent creature, who had re&s;cued her from the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;Might he a&s;k the name of the per&s;on, who had done that good action? I told him both his name and place of abode, de&s;cribed in as few words as I could the &s;ituation he had found her and Con|&s;tantia in, &s;poke briefly, but warmly, of his cha|racter, and omitted not to give him as many particulars of my friend Ned as I thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary; in conclu&s;ion I made my&s;elf al&s;o known to him, and explained what my &s;mall part had been in the tran&s;action. He made his acknow|ledgments for the&s;e communications in very hand&s;ome terms, and then after a &s;hort pau&s;e, in which he &s;eemd under difficulty how to pro|ceed, he &s;poke to this effect:</P>
<P>I am aware that I &s;hall introduce my&s;elf to you under &s;ome di&s;advantages, when I tell you I
<PB N="267" REF="274">
am the father of that young woman's mother; but if you are not a parent your&s;elf, you cannot judge of a parent's feelings towards an undutiful child; and if you are one, I hope you have not had, nor ever will have, the experience of what I have felt: Let that pa&s;s therefore with|out further comment! I have now determined to &s;ee my daughter, and I hope I may avail my|&s;elf of your good offices in preparing her for the interview; I wi&s;h it to take place to-morrow, and, if you fore&s;ee no objection, let our meeting be at the hou&s;e of her benefactor Mr. Abra|hams; for to that worthy per&s;on, as you de|&s;cribe him to be, I have many nece&s;&s;ary apologies to make, and more thanks than I &s;hall know how to repay; for the pre&s;ent I mu&s;t beg you will &s;ay nothing about me in this place.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e points I gave him &s;atisfactory a&s;&s;urances, and &s;ettled the hour of twelve next day for the meeting; he then drew a &s;hagreen ca&s;e out of his pocket, which he put into my hand, &s;aying, that if I would compare that face with Con&s;tantia's I could not wonder at the agitation, which &s;o &s;trong a family-re&s;emblance had given him; it was a portrait of his decea&s;ed wife at Con&s;tantia's age; the fir&s;t glance he had of her features had &s;truck him to the heart; he could not keep his eyes from her; &s;he was
<PB N="268" REF="275">
indeed a perfect beauty; he had never beheld any thing to compare with her, but that coun|terpart of her image then in my hand; he begged to leave it in my care till our meeting next morning; perhaps, added he, the &s;ight of it will give a pang of &s;en&s;ibility to my poor di&s;carded child, but I think it will give her joy al&s;o, if you tender it as a pledge of my reconciliation and returning love.</P>
<P>Here his voice &s;hook, his eyes &s;wam in tears, and cla&s;ping my hand eagerly between his, he conjured me to remember what I had pro|mi&s;ed, and ha&s;tened out of the hou&s;e.</P>

<P>WHEN I had parted from the old gentle|man, I found Mrs. Abrahams de&s;irous to return home, being &s;omewhat indi&s;po&s;ed by the heat of the theatre, &s;o that I lo&s;t no time in getting her and Con&s;tantia into the coach: In our way homewards I reported the conver&s;ation I had held with Mr. Goodi&s;on; the different effects it had upon my hearers were &s;uch as might be expected from their &s;everal characters; the gentle &s;pirit of Con&s;tantia found relief in tears; her grateful heart di&s;charged it&s;elf in prai&s;es and thank&s;givings to Providence: Mrs. Abrahams forgot her head-ach, felicitated her&s;elf in having prevailed upon Mrs. Goodi&s;on to con|&s;ent to her daughter's going to the play, declared &s;he had a pre&s;entiment that &s;omething fortunate would come to pa&s;s, thought the title of the co|medy was a lucky omen, congratulated Con|&s;tantia over and over, and begged to be indulged in the plea&s;ure of telling the&s;e mo&s;t joyful tidings to her good man at home: Ned put in his claim for a &s;hare in the prophecy no le&s;s than Mrs. Abrahams; he had a kind of a &s;omething in his
<PB N="270" REF="277">
thoughts, when Goodi&s;on &s;at at his elbow, that did not quite amount to a di&s;covery, and yet it was very like it; he had a &s;ort of an impul&s;e to give him a gird or two upon the character of <HI>Sterling,</HI> and he was very &s;ure that what he threw out upon the occa&s;ion made him &s;queak, and that the di&s;covery would never have come about, if it had not been for him; he even ad|vanced &s;ome learned remarks upon the good ef|fects of &s;tage-plays in giving touches to the con|&s;cience, though I do not pretend to &s;ay he had <HI>Jeremy Collier</HI> in his thoughts at the time; in &s;hort, what between the Hebrew and the Chri&s;|tian there was little or nothing left for my &s;hare in the work, &s;o that I contented my&s;elf with cautioning Con&s;tantia how &s;he broke it to her mother, and recommended to Mrs. Abrahams to confine her di&s;cour&s;e to her hu&s;band, and leave Con&s;tantia to undertake for Mrs. Goodi|&s;on.</P>
<P>When we arrived at our journey's end we found the hone&s;t Jew alone, and &s;urpri&s;ed him before he expected us: Mrs. Goodi&s;on was gone to bed a little indi&s;po&s;ed, Con&s;tantia ha&s;t|ened up to her without entering the parlour; Mrs. Abrahams let loo&s;e the clapper of joy and rang in the good news with &s;o full a peal and &s;o many changes, that there was no more to be
<PB N="271" REF="278">
done on my part but to correct a few trips in the performance of the nature of pleona&s;ms, which were calculated to improve the tale in every particular but the truth of it. When &s;he had fairly acquitted her&s;elf of the hi&s;tory, &s;he began to recollect her head-ach, and then left us very thoroughly di&s;po&s;ed to have a fellow-feeling in the &s;ame complaint.</P>
<P>After a few natural reflections upon the event, &s;oberly debated and patiently delivered, I believe we were all of one mind in wi&s;hing for a new &s;ubject, and a &s;ilence took place &s;ufficiently pre|paratory for it's introduction; when Abrahams, putting on a grave and &s;erious look, in a more &s;olemn tone of voice, than I had ever heard him a&s;&s;ume, delivered him&s;elf as follows:</P>
<P>There is &s;omething, Gentlemen, pre&s;&s;es on my mind, which &s;eems a duty on my con&s;cience to impart to you: I cannot reconcile my&s;elf to play the counterfeit in your company, and there|fore if you will have patience to li&s;ten to a few particulars of a life, &s;o unimportant as mine, I will not intrude long upon your attention, and at wor&s;t it may &s;erve to fill up a few &s;pare mi|nutes before we are called to our meal.</P>
<P>I need not repeat what was &s;aid on our parts; we drew our chairs round the fire; Abrahams gave a &s;igh, hemmed twice or thrice, as if the
<PB N="272" REF="279">
words in ri&s;ing to his throat had choaked him, and thus began:</P>
<P>I was born in Spain, the only &s;on of a younger brother of an antient and noble hou&s;e, which like many others of the &s;ame origin and per&s;ua&s;ion had long been in the indi&s;pen&s;able practice of conforming to the e&s;tabli&s;hed re|ligion, whil&s;t &s;ecretly and under the mo&s;t guarded concealment every member of it with|out exception hath adhered to tho&s;e opinions, which have been the faith of our tribe from the earlie&s;t ages.</P>
<P>This I tru&s;t will account to you for my de|clining to expo&s;e my real name, and ju&s;tify the di&s;cretion of my a&s;&s;uming the fictitious one, by which I am now known to you.</P>
<P>Till I had reached my twentieth year I knew my&s;elf for nothing but a Chri&s;tian, if that may be called Chri&s;tianity, which monki&s;h &s;uper|&s;tition and idolatry have &s;o adulterated and di&s;torted from the moral purity of it's &s;criptural guides, as to keep no traces even of rationality in it's form and practice.</P>
<P>This period of life is the u&s;ual &s;ea&s;on for the parents of an adult to reveal to him the awful &s;ecret of their concealed religion: The circum|&s;tances, under which this tremendous di&s;covery is confided to the youth, are &s;o contrived as to
<PB N="273" REF="280">
imprint upon his heart the &s;tronge&s;t &s;eal of &s;e|crecy, and at the &s;ame time pre&s;ent to his choice the alternative of parricide or conformity: With me there was no he&s;itation; none could be; for the yoke of Rome had galled my con&s;cience till it fe&s;tered, and I &s;eized emancipation with the avidity of a ran&s;omed &s;lave, who e&s;capes out of the hands of infidels.</P>
<P>Upon our great and &s;olemn day of the Pa&s;&s;|over I was initiated into Judai&s;m; my father conducted me to the interior chamber of a &s;uite of apartments, locking every door, through which we pa&s;&s;ed, with great precaution, and not uttering a &s;yllable by the way; in this &s;ecure retreat he purpo&s;ed to celebrate that antient rite, which our nation holds &s;o &s;acred: He was at that time in an alarming decline; the agi|tating ta&s;k he had been engaged in overpowered his &s;pirits; whil&s;t he was yet &s;peaking to me, and my eyes were fixed upon his face, the hand of death &s;mote him; I &s;aw his eye-lids quiver; I heard him draw his la&s;t expiring &s;igh, and fall|ing dead upon my neck as I was kneeling at his feet, he brought me backwards to the floor, where I laid panting under his lifele&s;s corp&s;e, &s;carce more alive than he was.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e of his fall and the horrid &s;hrieks I began to utter, for I had no pre&s;ence of mind in
<PB N="274" REF="281">
that fatal moment, were unfortunately over|heard, far as we were removed from the family: The room we were in had a communication with our private chapel; the monk, who was our family confe&s;&s;or, had a ma&s;ter-key, which commanded the avenues to that place; he was then before the altar, when my cries reached his ears; he a&s;cended ha&s;tily by the private &s;tair|ca&s;e, and finding the door locked, his terror at my yells adding &s;trength to a colo&s;&s;al form, with one vehement kick he bur&s;t open the door, and, be&s;ides the tragic &s;pectacle on the ground, too plainly di&s;covered the damning proofs of our apo&s;tacy.</P>
<P>Vile wretch, cried he as he &s;eized hold of my father's body, unholy villain, circumci&s;ed infi|del! I thank my God for having &s;mote thee with a &s;udden judgment: Lie there like a dog as thou art, and expect the burial of a dog! This &s;aid, with one furious jerk of his arm he hurled the venerable corp&s;e of the mo&s;t benevo|lent of God's creatures with the utmo&s;t violence to the corner of the room: Whil&s;t I tell it my blood curdles; I heard his head da&s;h again&s;t the marble floor; I did not dare to turn my eyes to the &s;pot; the &s;word, which my father had pre|&s;ented to my hand and pointed at his own brea&s;t, when he imparted to me his faith, lay naked on
<PB N="275" REF="282">
the floor; I gra&s;ped it in my hand; nature tugged at my heart; I felt an impul&s;e irre&s;i&s;ti|ble; I buried it in the bowels of the monk: I thru&s;t it home with &s;o good a will, that the guard entangled in the cord that was tied about his carca&s;e; I left my weapon in the body, and the ponderous bigot fell thundering on the pave|ment.</P>
<P>A ready thought, which &s;eemed like in&s;pi|ration, &s;eized me; I di&s;po&s;ed my father's corp&s;e in decent order; drew the ring from his finger, on which the &s;ymbol of our tribe was engraved in Hebrew characters; I took away tho&s;e fatal tokens, which had betrayed us; there were im|plements for writing on a table; I wrote the following words on a &s;croll of paper&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"This monk fell by my hand; he merited the death I gave him: Let not my father's memory be attainted! He is innocent, and died &s;uddenly by the will of Heaven and not by the hand of man."</Q>&mdash;This I &s;igned with my name, and affixed to the brea&s;t of the monk; then imprint|ing a la&s;t ki&s;s upon the hand of my dead father, I went &s;oftly down the &s;ecret &s;tairs, and pa&s;&s;ing through the chapel e&s;caped out of the hou&s;e un|noticed by any of the family.</P>
<P>Our hou&s;e &s;tood at one extremity of the an|tient
<PB N="276" REF="283">
city of Segovia; I made my way as fa&s;t as my feet would tran&s;port me to the fore&s;ts of San Ildephon&s;o, and there &s;heltered my&s;elf till night came on; by &s;hort and &s;tealthy journeys, through various perils and almo&s;t incredible hard&s;hips, I arrived at Barcelona; I made my&s;elf known to an Engli&s;h merchant, &s;ettled there, who had long been a corre&s;pondent of my father's, and was employed by our family in the exportation of their wool, which is the chief produce of e&s;tates in the great plain of Segovia, &s;o famous for it's &s;heep: By this gentleman I was &s;upplied with money and nece&s;&s;aries; he al&s;o gave me letters of credit upon his corre&s;pondent in Lon|don, and took a pa&s;&s;age for me in a very com|modious and capital &s;hip bound to that port, but intermediately to Smyrna, whither &s;he was chartered with a valuable cargo. Ever &s;ince the unhappy event in Segovia it had been my fir&s;t and con&s;tant wi&s;h to take refuge in Eng|land; nothing therefore could be more accepta|ble than the&s;e letters of credit and introduction, and being eager to place my&s;elf under the pro|tection of a nation, who&s;e genero&s;ity all Europe bears te&s;timony to, I lo&s;t not a moment in em|barking on board the Briti&s;h Lion, (for &s;o the &s;hip was named) and in this a&s;ylum I for the
<PB N="277" REF="284">
fir&s;t time found that repo&s;e of mind and body, which for more than two months I had been a &s;tranger to.</P>
<P>Here I fortunately made acquaintance with a very worthy and ingenious gentleman, who was going to &s;ettle at Smyrna as phy&s;ician to the factory, and to the care and humanity of this excellent per&s;on, under Providence, I am in|debted for my recovery from a very dangerous fever, which &s;eized me on the third day after my coming on board: This gentleman re&s;ided many years at Smyrna, and practi&s;ed there with great &s;ucce&s;s; he afterwards went through a very curious cour&s;e of travel, and is now happily returned to his native country.</P>
<P>When we arrived at Smyrna I was on my recovery, and yet under the care of my friendly phy&s;ician; I lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e with him, and found great benefit from the air and exer|ci&s;e on &s;hore: He advi&s;ed me to remain there for a &s;ea&s;on, and at the &s;ame time an offer was made to me by the &s;hip's captain of acting for the merchants in place of their agent, who had died on the pa&s;&s;age. The letters of credit given me at Barcelona, and the &s;ecurity entered into on my account with the hou&s;e in London, war|ranted this propo&s;al on his part, and there were
<PB N="278" REF="285">
many motives, which prevailed with me for ac|cepting it.</P>
<P>In this &s;tation I had the good fortune to give &s;uch &s;atisfaction to my principals, that during a re&s;idence of more than twenty years I nego|tiated their bu&s;ine&s;s with uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s, and in the cour&s;e of that time &s;ecured a compe|tency for my&s;elf, and married a very worthy wife, with whom I have lived happily ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Still my wi&s;hes pointed to this land of free|dom and toleration, and here at la&s;t I hope I am &s;et down for life: Such was my prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for this country, that I may &s;ay without boa&s;ting during twenty years re&s;idence in Smyrna no Engli&s;hman ever left my door without the re|lief he &s;olicited, or appeared to &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit to tell you that to my in|finite comfort it turned out, that my precautions after the death of the monk were effectual for preventing any mi&s;chief to the head of my fa|mily, who &s;till pre&s;erves his rank, title and e&s;tate un&s;u&s;pected; and although I was out|lawed by name, time hath now wrought &s;uch a change in my per&s;on, and the affair hath &s;o died away in men's memories, that I tru&s;t I am in &s;ecurity from any future machinations in that
<PB N="279" REF="286">

<P>IF the pre&s;ent ta&s;te for private plays &s;preads as fa&s;t as mo&s;t fa&s;hions do in this country, we may expect the ri&s;ing generation will be, like the Greeks in my motto, one entire nation of actors and actre&s;&s;es. A father of a family may &s;hortly reckon it among&s;t the ble&s;&s;ings of a nu|merous progeny, that he is provided with a &s;uf|ficient company for his dome&s;tic &s;tage, and may ca&s;t a play to his own liking without going abroad for his theatrical amu&s;ements. Such a
<PB N="281" REF="288">
&s;teady troop cannot fail of being under better regulation than a &s;et of &s;trollers, or than any &s;et whatever, who make acting a vocation: Where a manager has to deal with none but players of his own begetting, every play bids fair to have a &s;trong ca&s;t, and in the phra&s;e of the &s;tage to be well got up. Happy author, who &s;hall &s;ee his characters thus grouped into a family-piece, firm as the Theban band of friends, where all is zeal and concord, no bickerings nor jealou&s;ies about &s;tage-precedency, no ladies to fall &s;ick of the &s;pleen, and to&s;s up their parts in a huff, no heart-burnings about flounced petticoats and &s;il|ver trimmings, where the mother of the whole company &s;tands wardrobe-keeper and property-woman, whil&s;t the father takes po&s;t at the &s;ide &s;cene in the capacity of prompter with plenipo|tentiary controul over PS's and OP's.</P>
<P>I will no longer &s;peak of the difficulty of writing a comedy or tragedy, becau&s;e that is now done by &s;o many people without any diffi|culty at all, that if there ever was any my&s;tery in it, that my&s;tery is thoroughly bottomed and laid open; but the art of acting was till very lately thought &s;o rare and wonderful an excel|lence, that people began to look upon a perfect actor as a phenomenon in the world, which they were not to expect above once in a century;
<PB N="282" REF="289">
but now that the trade is laid open, this prodigy is to be met at the turn of every &s;treet; the no|bility and gentry to their immortal honour have broken up the monopoly, and new-made players are now as plentiful as new-made peers.</P>
<Q><L>Nec tamen Antiochus, nec erit mirabilis illic</L>

<Q><L>Garrick and Powell would be now no wonder,</L>
<L>Nor Barry's &s;ilver note, nor Quin's heroic thunder.</L></Q>
<P>Though the public profe&s;&s;ors of the art are &s;o compleatly put down by the private practitioners of it, it is but ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve in mitigation of their defeat, that they meet the compari&s;on un|der &s;ome di&s;advantages, which their rivals have not to contend with.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e is diffidence, which volunteers cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to feel in the degree they do, who are pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice: I never yet &s;aw a public actor come upon the &s;tage on the fir&s;t night of a new play, who did not &s;eem to be nearly, if not quite, in as great a &s;haking fit as his author; but as there can be no luxury in a great fright, I cannot believe that people of fa&s;hion, who act for their amu&s;ement only, would &s;ubject them&s;elves to it; they mu&s;t cer|tainly have a proper confidence in their own abilities, or they would never &s;tep out of a
<PB N="283" REF="290">
drawing room, where they are &s;ure to figure, upon a &s;tage, where they run the ri&s;que of ex|po&s;ing them&s;elves; &s;ome gentlemen perhaps, who have been <HI>mutae per&s;onae</HI> in the &s;enate, may &s;tart at the fir&s;t &s;ound of their own voices in a theatre, but graceful action, ju&s;t elocution, per|fect knowledge of their author, elegant deport|ment, and every advantage, that refined man|ners and courtly addre&s;s can be&s;tow, is exclu|&s;ively their own: In all &s;cenes of high life they are at home; noble &s;entiments are natural to them; love-parts they can play by in&s;tinct, and as for all the ca&s;ts of rakes, game&s;ters and fine-gentlemen they can fill them to the life. Think only what a violence it mu&s;t be to the nerves of an humble unpretending actor to be obliged to play the gallant gay &s;educer and be the cuckold-maker of the comedy, when he has no other ob|ject at heart but to go quietly home, when the play is over, to his wife and children and parti|cipate with them in the hone&s;t earnings of his vocation; can &s;uch a man compete with the Lo|thario of high life?</P>
<P>And now I mention the cares of a family, I &s;trike upon another di&s;advantage, which the public performer is &s;ubject to and the private exempt from: The Andromache of the &s;tage may have an infant Hector at home, whom &s;he
<PB N="284" REF="291">
more tenderly feels for than the Hector of the &s;cene; he may be &s;ick, he may be &s;upperle&s;s; there may be none to nur&s;e him, when his mo|ther is out of &s;ight, and the maternal intere&s;t in the divided heart of the actre&s;s may preponderate over the heroine's: This is a ca&s;e not within the chances to happen to any lady-actre&s;s, who of cour&s;e con&s;igns the ta&s;k of education to other hands, and keeps her own at lei&s;ure for more pre&s;&s;ing duties.</P>
<P>Public performers have their memories loaded and di&s;tracted with a variety of parts, and often|times are compelled to &s;uch a repetition of the &s;ame part, as cannot fail to quench the &s;pirit of the repre&s;entation; they mu&s;t obey the call of duty, be the ca&s;t of the character what it may&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;Cum Thaida &s;u&s;tinet, aut cum</L>
<L>Uxorem comaedus agit.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Subject to all the various ca&s;ts of life,</L>
<L>Now the loo&s;e harlot, now the virtuous wife.</L></Q></P>
<P>But, what is wor&s;e than all, the veterans of the public &s;tage will &s;ometimes be appointed to play the old and ugly, as I can in&s;tance in the per&s;on of a mo&s;t admirable actre&s;s, whom I have often &s;een, and never without the tribute of ap|plau&s;e, in the ca&s;ts of <HI>Juliet's Nur&s;e, Aunt De|borah,</HI> and other venerable dam&s;els in the vale

of years, when I am confident there is not a lady of independent rank in England of <HI>Mrs. Pitt</HI>'s age, who would not rather &s;truggle for <HI>Mi&s;s Jenny</HI> or <HI>Mi&s;s Hoyden,</HI> than &s;toop to be the repre&s;entative of &s;uch old hags.</P>
<P>The&s;e and the &s;ubjection public performers are under to the caprice of the &s;pectators, and to the attacks of conceited and misjudging cri|tics are among&s;t the many di&s;agreeable circum|&s;tances, which the mo&s;t eminent mu&s;t expect and the mo&s;t fortunate cannot e&s;cape.</P>
<P>It would be hard indeed if performers of di&s;tinction, who u&s;e the &s;tage only as an elegant and moral re&s;ource, &s;hould be &s;ubject to any of the&s;e unplea&s;ant conditions, and yet as a friend to the ri&s;ing fame of the dome&s;tic drama I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that there are &s;ome precautions nece&s;|&s;ary, which it's patrons have not yet attended to. There are &s;o many con&s;equences to be guarded again&s;t, as well as provi&s;ions to be made for an e&s;tabli&s;hment of this &s;ort, that it behoves it's conductors to take their fir&s;t ground with great judgment; and above all things to be very careful that an exhibition &s;o ennobled by it's actors, may be ca&s;t into &s;uch a &s;tile and character, as may keep it clear from any po&s;&s;ible compari&s;on with &s;pectacles, which it &s;hould not conde&s;cend to imitate, and cannot hope to equal.
<PB N="286" REF="293">
This I believe has not been attempted, perhaps not even reflected upon, and yet if I may &s;peak from information of &s;pecimens, which I have not been pre&s;ent at, there are many reforms needful both in it's external as well as internal arrangement.</P>
<P>By external I mean &s;pectacle, comprehending theatre, &s;tage, &s;cenery, orche&s;tra, and all things el&s;e, which fall within the province of the <HI>arbiter deliciarum:</HI> The&s;e &s;hould be planned upon a model new, original and peculiar to them&s;elves; &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed from our public play-hou&s;es, that they &s;hould not &s;trike the eye, as now they do, like a copy in miniature, but as the independant &s;ketch of a ma&s;ter, who di&s;dains to copy. I can call to mind many noble halls and &s;tately apartments in the great hou&s;es and ca&s;tles of our nobility, which would give an arti&s;t ample field for fancy, and which with pro|per help would be di&s;po&s;ed into new and &s;triking &s;hapes for &s;uch a &s;cene of action, as &s;hould be|come the dignity of the performers. Halls and &s;aloons, flanked with interior columns and &s;ur|rounded by galleries, would with the aid of pro|per draperies or &s;cenery in the intercolumnations take a rich and elegant appearance, and at the &s;ame time the mu&s;ic might be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed in the gallery, as to produce a mo&s;t animating effect.
<PB N="287" REF="294">
A very &s;mall elevation of &s;tage &s;hould be al|lowed of, and no contraction by &s;ide &s;cenes to huddle the &s;peakers together and embarra&s;s their deportment; no &s;hift of &s;cene whatever, and no curtain to draw up and drop, as if puppets were to play behind it; the area, appropriated to the performers, &s;hould be &s;o dre&s;&s;ed and furni&s;hed with all &s;uitable accommodations, as to afford every po&s;&s;ible opportunity to the performers of varying their actions and po&s;tures, whether of &s;itting, walking or &s;tanding, as their &s;ituations in the &s;cene, or their intere&s;t in the dialogue may dictate; &s;o as to familiarize and a&s;&s;imilate their whole conduct and conver&s;ation through the progre&s;s of the drama to the manners and habits of well-bred per&s;ons in real life.</P>
<P>Prologues and epilogues in the modern &s;tile of writing and &s;peaking them I regard as very unbecoming, and I &s;hould blu&s;h to &s;ee any lady of fa&s;hion in that &s;illy and un&s;eemly &s;ituation: They are the la&s;t remaining corruptions of the antient drama; reliques of &s;ervility, and only are retained in our London theatres as vehicles of humiliation at the introduction of a new play, and traps for fal&s;e wit, extravagant conceits and female flippancy at the conclu&s;ion of it: Where authors are petitioners, and players &s;ervants to the public the&s;e conde&s;cen&s;ions mu&s;t be made,
<PB N="288" REF="295">
but where poets are not &s;uitors, and performers are benefactors, why &s;hould the free Mu&s;e wear &s;hackles? for &s;uch they are, though the fingers of the brave are employed to put them on the limbs of the fair.</P>
<P>As I am &s;atisfied nothing ought to be admit|ted from beginning to end, which can provoke compari&s;ons, I revolt with indignation from the idea of a lady of fa&s;hion being trammelled in the trickery of the &s;tage, and taught her airs and graces, till &s;he is made the mere <HI>fac-&s;imile</HI> of a manneri&s;t, where the mo&s;t &s;he can a&s;pire to is to be the copy of a copyi&s;t: Let none &s;uch be con&s;ulted in dre&s;&s;ing or drilling an honorary no|vitiate in the forms and fa&s;hions of the public &s;tage; it is a cour&s;e of di&s;cipline, which neither per&s;on will profit by; a kind of barter, in which both parties will give and receive fal&s;e airs and fal&s;e conceits; the fine lady will be di&s;qualified by copying the actre&s;s, and the actre&s;s will be|come ridiculous by apeing the fine lady.</P>
<P>As for the choice of the drama, which is &s;o nice and difficult a part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;carce believe there is one play upon the li&s;t, which in all it's parts and pa&s;&s;ages is thoroughly adapted to &s;uch a ca&s;t as I am &s;peaking of: Where it has been in public u&s;e I am &s;ure it is not, for there compari&s;ons are unavoidable. Plays pro|fe&s;&s;edly

wrote for the &s;tage mu&s;t deal in &s;trong character, and &s;triking contra&s;t: How can a lady &s;tand forward in a part, contrived to pro|duce ridicule or di&s;gu&s;t, or which is founded upon broad humour and vulgar buffoonery?&mdash;

<L>Non per&s;ona loqui.</L></Q>
<Q><L>'Tis &s;he her&s;elf, and not her ma&s;k which &s;peaks.</L></Q></P>
<P>I doubt if it be altogether &s;eemly for a gentle|man to undertake, unle&s;s he can reconcile him|&s;elf to cry out with Laberius&mdash;

<Q><L>E&s;quire I &s;ign'd my&s;elf at noon,</L>
<L>At night I counter&s;ign'd Buffoon.</L></Q></P>
<P>The drama therefore mu&s;t be purpo&s;ely writ|ten for the occa&s;ion; and the writer mu&s;t not only have local knowledge of every arrangement preparatory for the exhibition, but per&s;onal know|ledge al&s;o of the performers, who are to exhibit it. The play it&s;elf, in my conception of it, &s;hould be part only of the projected entertain|ment, woven into the device of a grand and &s;plendid <HI>f&eacute;te,</HI> given in &s;ome noble country hou&s;e or palace: Neither &s;hould the &s;pectators be to|tally

<P>And now let me &s;ay one word to qualify the irony I &s;et out with and acquit my&s;elf as a morali&s;t.</P>
<P>There are many and great authorities again&s;t this &s;pecies of entertainment, and certainly the danger is great, where theatrical propen&s;ities are too much indulged in young and inexperienced minds. Tertullian &s;ays, (but he is &s;peaking of a very licentious theatre) <HI>Theatrum &s;acrarium e&s;t Veneris</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"A playhou&s;e is the very &s;acri&s;ty of Venus."</Q>And Juvenal, who wrote in times of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t impurity, maintains that no prudent man will take any young lady to wife, who has ever been even within the walls of a theatre&mdash;<Q><L>Cuneis an habent &s;pectacula totis</L>

<Q><L>Look round, and &s;ay if any man of &s;en&s;e</L>
<L>Will dare to &s;ingle out a wi&s;e from hence?</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="298">Young women of humble rank and &s;mall pre|ten&s;ions &s;hould be particularly cautious how a vain ambition of being noticed by their &s;uperiors betrays them into an attempt at di&s;playing their unprotected per&s;ons on a &s;tage, however dig|nified and re&s;pectable. If they have talents, and of cour&s;e applau&s;e, are their under&s;tandings and manners proof again&s;t applau&s;e? If they mi&s;take their talents, and merit no applau&s;e, are they &s;ure they will get no contempt for their &s;elf|conceit? If they have both acting talents and attractive charms, I tremble for their danger; let the fooli&s;h parent, who&s;e itching ears tingled with the plaudits, that re&s;ounded through the theatre, where virgin mode&s;ty depo&s;ited it's blu&s;hes, beware how his aching heart &s;hall throb with &s;orrow, when the daughter, <HI>quae pudica ad theatrum acce&s;&s;erat, inde revertetur impudica.

<P>So much by way of caution to the guardians and protectors of innocence; let the offence light where it may, I care not, &s;o it &s;erves the cau&s;e for which my heart is pledged.</P>
<P>As for my opinion of private plays in general, though it is a fa&s;hion, which hath kings and princes for it's nur&s;ing fathers and queens and prince&s;&s;es for it's nur&s;ing mothers, I think it is a fa&s;hion, that &s;hould be cautiou&s;ly indulged and

<P>I THINK the ladies will not accu&s;e me of bu&s;ying my&s;elf in impertinent remarks upon their dre&s;s and attire, for indeed it is not to their per&s;ons my &s;ervices are devoted, but to their minds: If I can add to them any thing orna|mental, or take from them any thing unbecom|ing, I &s;hall gain my wi&s;h; the re&s;t I &s;hall leave to their milliners and mantua-makers.</P>
<P>Now if I have any merit with them for not intruding upon their toilets, let them &s;hew me &s;o much complai&s;ance, as not to read this paper,

whil&s;t they are engaged in tho&s;e occupations, which I have never before interrupted; for as I intend to talk with them a little metaphy&s;ically, I would not wi&s;h to divide their attention, nor &s;hall I be contented with le&s;s than the whole.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place I mu&s;t tell them, gentle though they be, that human nature is &s;ubject to a variety of pa&s;&s;ions; &s;ome of the&s;e are virtuous pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ome on the contrary I am afraid are evil; there are however a number of interme|diate propen&s;ities, mo&s;t of which might al&s;o be termed pa&s;&s;ions, which by the proper influence of rea&s;on may become very u&s;eful allies to any one &s;ingle virtue, when in danger of being over|powered by a ho&s;t of foes: At the &s;ame time they are as capable of being kidnapped by the enemies of rea&s;on, and, when enli&s;ted in the ranks of the in&s;urgents, &s;eldom fail to turn the fate of the battle, and commit dreadful havock in the peaceful quarters of the invaded virtue. It is apparent then that all the&s;e intermediate propen&s;ities are a kind of balancing powers, which &s;eem indeed to hold a neutrality in moral affairs, but, holding it with arms in their hands, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to remain impartial &s;pecta|tors of the fray, and therefore mu&s;t be either with us, or again&s;t us.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make my&s;elf better under&s;tood when I
<PB N="298" REF="305">
proceed to in&s;tance them, and I will begin with that, which has been called the univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>The love of Fame.</HI></P>
<P>I pre&s;ume no lady will di&s;avow this propen|&s;ity; I would not wi&s;h her to attempt it; let her examine it however; let her fir&s;t enquire to what point it is likely to carry her before &s;he commits her&s;elf to it's conduct: If it is to be her guide to that fame only, which excels in fa&s;hionable di&s;&s;ipation, figures in the fir&s;t circles of the gay world, and is the load&s;tone to attract every libertine of high life into the &s;phere of it's activity, it is a traiterous guide, and is &s;educing her to a precipice, that will &s;ooner or later be the grave of her happine&s;s: On the contrary, if it propo&s;es to avoid the&s;e dangerous pur&s;uits, and recommends a progre&s;s through paths le&s;s tempting to the eye perhaps, but terminated by &s;ub&s;tantial comforts, &s;he may &s;ecurely follow a propen&s;ity, which cannot mi&s;lead her, and in|dulge a pa&s;&s;ion, which will be the moving &s;pring of all her actions, and but for which her nature would want energy, and her character be no otherwi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed than by avoidance of vice without the grace and merit of any po&s;itive virtue. I can hardly &s;uppo&s;e, if it was put to a lady's choice at her out&s;et into life which kind of fame &s;he would be di&s;tingui&s;hed for, good or
<PB N="299" REF="306">
evil, but that &s;he would at once prefer the good; I mu&s;t believe &s;he would acknowledge more gratification in being &s;ignalized as the be&s;t wife, the be&s;t mother, the mo&s;t exemplary woman of her time, than in being pointed out in all circles &s;he frequents as the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable rake, the be&s;t dre&s;&s;ed voluptuary in the nation: If this be rightly conjectured, why will not every woman, who has her choice to make, direct her ambition to tho&s;e objects, which will give her mo&s;t &s;ati&s;|faction, when attained? There can be no rea&s;on but becau&s;e it impo&s;es on her &s;ome &s;elf-denials by the way, which &s;he has not fortitude to &s;ur|mount; and it is plain &s;he does not love fame well enough to be at much pains in acquiring it; her ambition does not reach at noble ob|jects, her pa&s;&s;ion for celebrity is no better than that of a buffoon's, who for the vanity of being con&s;picuous &s;ubmits to be contemptible.</P>
<P><HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> is a word which has a very capti|vating &s;ound, but is by no means of a decided quality; it may be friend or foe as rea&s;on and true judgment &s;hall determine for it. If I were to decry all female friend&s;hips in the lump it might &s;eem a har&s;h &s;entence, and yet it will &s;e|riou&s;ly behove every parent to keep &s;trict watch over this propen&s;ity in the early movements of the female mind. I am not di&s;po&s;ed to expatiate
<PB N="300" REF="307">
upon it's dangers very particularly; they are &s;ufficiently known to people of experience and di&s;cretion; but attachments mu&s;t be &s;temmed in their beginnings; keep off corre&s;pondents from your daughters as you would keep off the pe&s;tilence: Romantic mi&s;&s;es, &s;entimental no|veli&s;ts and &s;cribbling pedants overturn each others heads with &s;uch eternal rhap&s;odies about friend&s;hip, and refine upon non&s;en&s;e with &s;uch an affectation of enthu&s;ia&s;m, that if it has not been the parent's &s;tudy to take early precautions again&s;t all &s;uch growing propen&s;ities, it will be in vain to oppo&s;e the torrent, when it carries all before it and overwhelms the pa&s;&s;ions with it's force.</P>
<P><HI>Sen&s;ibility</HI> is a mighty favorite with the fair &s;ex; it is an amiable friend or a very dangerous foe to virtue: Let the female, who profe&s;&s;es it, be careful how &s;he makes too full a di&s;play of her weakne&s;s; for this is &s;o very &s;oft and in|&s;inuating a propen&s;ity, that it will be found in mo&s;t female glo&s;&s;aries as a &s;ynonymous term for love it&s;elf; in fact it is little el&s;e than the <HI>nomme-de-guerre,</HI> which that in&s;idious adven|turer takes upon him in all fir&s;t approaches; the pa&s;s-word in all tho&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hing experi|ments, which young people make upon each other's affections, before they proceed to plainer
<PB N="301" REF="308">
declarations; it is the whet&s;tone, upon which love &s;harpens and prepares his arrows: If any lady makes a certain &s;how of &s;en&s;ibility in com|pany with her admirer, he mu&s;t be a very dull fellow, if he does not know how to turn the weapon from him&s;elf to her. Now &s;en&s;ibility a&s;&s;umes a different character when it is taken into the &s;ervice of benevolence, or made the centinel of mode&s;ty;in one ca&s;e it gives the &s;pring to pity, in the other the alarm to di&s;cre|tion; but whenever it a&s;&s;ails the heart by &s;oft &s;eduction to be&s;tow that pity and relief, which di&s;cretion does not warrant and purity ought not to grant, it &s;hould be treated as a renegado and a &s;py, which under the ma&s;k of charity would impo&s;e upon credulity for the vile&s;t pur|po&s;es, and betray the heart by flattering it to it's ruin.</P>
<P><HI>Vanity</HI> is a pa&s;&s;ion, to which I think I am very complai&s;ant, when I admit it to a place among&s;t the&s;e convertible propen&s;ities, for it is as much as I can do to find any occupation for it in the family-concerns of virtue; perhaps if I had not known <HI>Vane&s;&s;a</HI> I &s;hould not pay it even this &s;mall compliment: It can however do &s;ome under-offices in the hou&s;ehold of genero&s;ity, of chearfulne&s;s, ho&s;pitality, and certain other re|&s;pectable qualities: It is little el&s;e than an of|ficious,
<PB N="302" REF="309">
civil, &s;illy thing, that runs on errands for it's betters, and is content to be paid with a &s;mile for it's good-will by tho&s;e, who have too much good &s;en&s;e to &s;how it any real re&s;pect: When it is harmle&s;s, it would be hard to wound it out of wantonne&s;s; when it is mi&s;chievous, there is merit in cha&s;ti&s;ing it with the whip of ridicule: A lap-dog may be endured, if he is in|offen&s;ive and does not annoy the company, but a &s;nappi&s;h, barking pett, though in a lady's arms, de&s;erves to have his ears pulled for his imper|tinence.</P>
<P><HI>Delicacy</HI> is a &s;oft name, and fine ladies, who have a proper contempt for the vulgar, are very willing to be thought endowed with &s;en&s;es more refined and exqui&s;ite, than nature ever meant to give them; their nerves are &s;u&s;ceptible in the extreme and they are of con&s;titutions &s;o irri|table, that <HI>the very winds of heaven</HI> mu&s;t not be allowed to <HI>vi&s;it their face too roughly.</HI> I have &s;tudied this female favorite with &s;ome attention, and I am not yet able to di&s;cover any one of it's good qualities; I do not perceive the merit of &s;uch exqui&s;ite fibres, nor have I ob&s;erved that the &s;lendere&s;t &s;trings are apt to produce the &s;weete&s;t &s;ounds, when applied to in&s;truments of harmony; I pre&s;ume the female heart &s;hould be &s;uch an harmonious in&s;trument, when touched
<PB N="303" REF="310">
by the parent, the friend, the hu&s;band; but how can the&s;e expect a concert of &s;weet &s;ounds to be excited from a thing, which is liable to be jarred and put out of tune by every breath of air? It may be kept in it's ca&s;e, like an old-fa&s;hioned virginal, which nobody knows, or even wi&s;hes to know, how to touch: It can never be brought to bear it's part in a family concert, but mu&s;t hang by the wall, or at be&s;t be a &s;olo in&s;trument for the remainder of it's days.</P>
<P><HI>Ba&s;hfulne&s;s,</HI> when it is attached to mode&s;ty, will be regarded with the eye of candor and cheared with the &s;mile of encouragement; but ba&s;hfulne&s;s is a hireling, and is &s;ometimes di&s;|covered in the livery of pride, oftentimes in the ca&s;t-off trappings of affectation; pedantry is very apt to bring it into company, and &s;ly, &s;ecret con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s will frequently <HI>blu&s;h becau&s;e it un|der&s;tands.</HI> I do not &s;ay I have much to lay to it's charge, for it is not apt to be trouble&s;ome in polite &s;ocieties, nor do I commonly meet it even in the younge&s;t of the female &s;ex. There is a great deal of blu&s;hing I confe&s;s in all the circles of fine ladies, but then it is &s;o univer&s;al a blu&s;h and withal &s;o permanent, that I am far from imputing it always to ba&s;hfulne&s;s, when the cheeks of the fair are tinged with ro&s;es. However, though it is &s;ometimes an impo&s;tor,
<PB N="304" REF="311">
and for that rea&s;on may de&s;erve to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, I cannot help having a con&s;ideration for one, that has in pa&s;t times been the handmaid of beauty, and therefore as merit has taken mode&s;ty into her &s;ervice, I would recommend to igno|rance to put ba&s;hfulne&s;s into full pay and em|ployment.</P>
<P><HI>Politene&s;s</HI> is a charming propen&s;ity, and I would wi&s;h the fine ladies to indulge it, if it were only by way of contra&s;t between them&s;elves and the fine gentlemen they con&s;ort with. I do not think it is altogether becoming for a lady to plant her&s;elf in the center of a circle with her back to the fire, and expect every body to be warmed by the contemplation of her figure or the reflection of her countenance; at the &s;ame time I am free to confe&s;s it an attitude, by which the man of high breeding is con&s;picu|ou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed, and is charming to behold, when &s;et off with the proper accompaniments of leather breeches, tight boots and a jockey wai&s;tcoat. I will not deny however but I have &s;een this practi&s;ed by ladies, who have acquitted them&s;elves with great &s;pirit on the occa&s;ion; but then it cannot be done without certain male ac|coutrements, and pre&s;uppo&s;es a &s;louched hat, half-boots, &s;hort wai&s;tcoat and riding dre&s;s, not to omit broad metal buttons with great letters

engraved upon them, or the &s;ignature of &s;ome hunt, with the indi&s;pen&s;able appendage of two long dangling watch-chains, which &s;erve to mark the double value people of fa&s;hion put upon their time, and al&s;o &s;hew the encourage|ment they be&s;tow upon the arts: With the&s;e implements the work may be done even by a female arti&s;t, but it is an art I wi&s;h no young lady to &s;tudy, and I hope the pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;ors will take no more pupils, whil&s;t the academies of <HI>Humphries</HI> and <HI>Mendoza</HI> are kept open for accompli&s;hments, which I think upon the whole are altogether as becoming. Politene&s;s, as I conceive, con&s;i&s;ts in putting people at their ea&s;e in your company, and being at your ea&s;e in their's; modern practice I am afraid is apt to mi&s;place this proce&s;s, for I ob&s;erve every body in fa&s;hionable life polite enough to &s;tudy their own ea&s;e, but I do not &s;ee much attention paid to that part of the rule, which ought to be fir&s;t ob&s;erved: It is well calculated for tho&s;e, who are adepts in it, but if ever &s;uch an out-of-the-way thing as a mode&s;t per&s;on comes within it's reach, the awkward novice is &s;ure to be di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed, and whil&s;t every body about him &s;eems repo&s;ing on a bed of down, he alone is picketted upon a &s;eat of thorns: Till this &s;hall be re|formed by the ladies, who profe&s;s to under&s;tand

<P>When I fir&s;t devoted my&s;elf to this work, I
