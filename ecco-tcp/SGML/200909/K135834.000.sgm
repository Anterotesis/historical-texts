<P>PERHAPS the Sentiments contained in the following Pages, are not <HI>yet</HI> &s;ufficiently fa&s;hionable to procure them general favor; a long habit of not thinking a Thing <HI>wrong,</HI> gives it a &s;uperficial appearance of being <HI>right,</HI> and rai&s;es at fir&s;t a formidable outcry in defence of Cu&s;tom. But the tumult &s;oon &s;ub&s;ides. Time makes more converts than Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>As a long and violent abu&s;e of Power, is gene|rally the means of calling the right of it in que&s;|tion (and in matters too which might never have been thought of, had not the Sufferers been ag|gravated into the enquiry) and as the King of England hath undertaken in his <HI>own right,</HI> to &s;upport the Parliament in what he calls <HI>theirs,</HI> and as the good People of this Country are griev|ou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed by the combination, they have an undoubted privilege to enquire into the preten|&s;ions of both, and equally to reject the u&s;urpa|tion of either.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Origin and De&s;ign of <HI>Government</HI> in general, with conci&s;e Remarks on the <HI>Engli&s;h Con&s;titution.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOME Writers have &s;o confounded Society with government, as to leave little or no di&s;tinction be|tween them; whereas, they are not only different, but have different origins. Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedne&s;s; the former promotes our happine&s;s <HI>po&s;&s;itively</HI> by uniting our affections, the latter <HI>negatively</HI> by re&s;training our vices. The one encourages intercour&s;e, the other creates di&s;tinctions. The fir&s;t is a patron, the la&s;t a puni&s;her.</P>
<P>Society in every &s;tate is a ble&s;&s;ing, but Government even in its be&s;t &s;tate is but a nece&s;&s;ary evil; in its wor&s;t &s;tate an intolerable one: for when we &s;uffer, or are expo&s;ed to the &s;ame mi&s;eries <HI>by a Government,</HI> which we might expect in a country <HI>without Government,</HI> our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furni&s;h the means by which we &s;uffer. Government like dre&s;s is the badge of lo&s;t innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradi&s;e. For were the impul&s;es of con&s;cience clear, uni|form, and irre&s;i&s;tibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the ca&s;e, he finds it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;urrender up a part of his property to furni&s;h means for the protection of the re&s;t; and this he is induced to do by the &s;ame prudence which in every other ca&s;e ad|vi&s;es him, out of two evils to choo&s;e the lea&s;t. <HI>Wherefore,</HI> &s;ecurity being the true de&s;ign and end of government, it unan&s;werably follows, that whatever <HI>form</HI> thereof appears
<PB N="2" REF="5">mo&s;t likely to en&s;ure it to us, with the lea&s;t expence and greate&s;t benefit, is preferable to all others.</P>
<P>In order to gain a clear and ju&s;t idea of the de&s;ign and end of government, let us &s;uppo&s;e a &s;mall number of per|&s;ons &s;ettled in &s;ome &s;eque&s;tered part of the earth uncon|nected with the re&s;t; they will then repre&s;ent the fir&s;t peopling of any country, or of the world. In this &s;tate of natural liberty, &s;ociety will be their fir&s;t thought. A thou&s;and motives will excite them thereto, the &s;trength of one man is &s;o unequal to his wants and his mind &s;o unfitted for perpetual &s;olitude, that he is &s;oon obliged to &s;eek a&s;&s;i&s;tance and relief of another, who in his turn requires the &s;ame. Four or five united would be able to rai&s;e a tolerable dwelling in the mid&s;t of a wilderne&s;s, but <HI>one</HI> man might labour out the common period of life without accompli&s;hing any thing; when he had felled his timber he could not remove it, nor erect it after it was removed; hunger in the mean time would urge him from his work, and every different want call him a different way. Di&s;ea&s;e, nay even misfortune would be death; for tho' neither might be mortal, yet either would di&s;able him from living, and reduce him to a &s;tate in which he might rather be &s;aid to peri&s;h, than to die.</P>
<P>Thus nece&s;&s;ity like a gravitating power would &s;oon form our newly arrived emigrants into &s;ociety, the reci|procal ble&s;&s;ings of which would &s;uper&s;ede, and render the obligations of law and government unnece&s;&s;ary, while they remained perfectly ju&s;t to each other: but as nothing but Heaven is impregnable to vice it will unavoidable happen that in proportion as they &s;urmount the fir&s;t difficulties of emigration, which bound them together in a common cau&s;e, they will begin to relax in their duty and attach|ment to each other: and this remi&s;&s;ne&s;s will point out the nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ome form of government to &s;upply the defect of moral virtue.</P>
<P>Some convenient Tree will afford them a State-Hou&s;e, under the branches of which, the whole Colony may
<PB N="3" REF="6">a&s;&s;emble to deliberate on public matters. It is more than probable that their fir&s;t laws will have the title only of REGULATIONS, and to be enforced by no other penalty than public di&s;e&s;teem. In this fir&s;t parliament every man by natural right will have a &s;eat.</P>
<P>But as the colony encrea&s;es, the public concerns will encrea&s;e likewi&s;e, and the di&s;tance at which the members may be &s;eparated, will render it too inconvenient for all of them to meet on every occa&s;ion as at fir&s;t, when their number was &s;mall, their habitations near, and the public concerns few and trifling. This will point out the con|venience of their con&s;enting to leave the legi&s;lative part to be managed by a &s;elect number cho&s;en from the whole body, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to have the &s;ame concerns at &s;take which tho&s;e have who appointed them, and will act in the &s;ame manner as the whole body would act were they pre&s;ent. If the colony continues encrea&s;ing, it will become nece&s;&s;ary to augment the number of the repre&s;entatives, and that the intere&s;t of every part of the colony may be attended to, it will be found be&s;t to divide the whole into convenient parts, each part &s;ending its proper number: and that the <HI>elected</HI> might never form to them&s;elves an intere&s;t &s;eperate from the electors, prudence will point out the pro|priety of having elections often: becau&s;e as the elected might by that means return and mix again with the general body of the electors in a few months, their fidelity to the public will be &s;ecured by the prudent reflexion of not making a rod for them&s;elves. And as this frequent interchange will e&s;tabli&s;h a common intere&s;t with every part of the commu|nity, they will mutually and naturally &s;upport each other, and on this (not on the unmeaning name of king) depends the <HI>&s;trength of Government; and the happine&s;s of the governed.</HI></P>
<P>Here then is the origin and ri&s;e of government; namely, a mode rendered nece&s;&s;ary by the inability of moral vir|tue to govern the world; here too is the de&s;ign and end of government, viz. freedom and &s;ecurity. And however
<PB N="4" REF="7">our eyes may be dazzled with &s;how, or our ears deceived by &s;ound; however prejudice may warp our wills, or intere&s;t darken our under&s;tanding, the &s;imple voice of nature and of rea&s;on will &s;ay, 'tis right.</P>
<P>I draw my idea of the form of government from a prin|ciple in nature which no art can overturn, viz. that the more &s;imple any thing is the le&s;s liable is it to be di&s;or|dered; and with this maxim in view I offer a few remarks on the &s;o much boa&s;ted con&s;titution of England. That it was noble for the dark and &s;lavi&s;h times in which it was erected, is granted. When the world was over-run with tyranny the lea&s;t remove therefrom was a glorious re&s;cue: But that it is imperfect, &s;ubject to convul&s;ions, and inca|pable of producing what it &s;eemed to promi&s;e is ea&s;ily demon&s;trated.</P>
<P>Ab&s;olute governments, (tho' the di&s;grace of human na|tute) have this advantage with them, that they are &s;imple; if the people &s;uffer, they know the head from which their &s;uffering &s;prings; know likewi&s;e the remedy; and are not bewildered by a variety of cau&s;es and cures. But the con&s;titution of England is &s;o exceedingly com|plex, that the nation may &s;uffer for years together without being able to di&s;cover in which part the fault lies, &s;ome will &s;ay in one and &s;ome in another, and every political phy&s;ician will advi&s;e a different medicine.</P>
<P>I know it is difficult to get over local or long &s;tanding prejudices, yet if we will &s;uffer our&s;elves to examine the component parts of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, we &s;hall find them to be the ba&s;e remains of two ancient tyrannies, compounded with &s;ome new Republican materials.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI>&mdash;The remains of Monarchical tyranny in the per&s;on of the King.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI>&mdash;The remains of Ari&s;tocratical tyranny in the per&s;ons of the Peers.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI>&mdash;The new republican materials, in the per|&s;ons of the Commons, on who&s;e virtue depends the free|dom of England.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8">The two fir&s;t by being hereditary are independent of the People; wherefore in a <HI>con&s;titutional &s;en&s;e</HI> they con|tribute nothing towards the freedom of the State.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that the con&s;titution of England is an <HI>union</HI> of three powers reciprocally <HI>checking</HI> each other, is farcical, either the words have no meaning or they are flat con|tradictions.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that the Commons are a check upon the King, pre&s;uppo&s;es two things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI>&mdash;That the King is not to be tru&s;ted without being looked after; or in other words, that a thir&s;t for ab&s;olute power is the natural di&s;ea&s;e of Monarchy.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly.</HI>&mdash;That the Commons by being appointed for that purpo&s;e, are either wi&s;er or more worthy of confi|dence than the Crown.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>But as the &s;ame con&s;titution which gives the Commons a power to check the King by with-holding the &s;upplies, gives afterwards the King a power to check the Commons by empowering him to reject their other bills; it again &s;uppo&s;es that the King is wi&s;er than tho&s;e, whom it has already &s;uppo&s;ed to be wi&s;er than him. A mere ab&s;urdity!</P>
<P>There is &s;omething exceedingly ridiculous in the compo|&s;ition of Monarchy, it fir&s;t excludes a man from the means of information yet empowers him to act in ca&s;es where the highe&s;t judgment is required.&mdash;The &s;tate of a King &s;huts him from the World; yet the bu&s;ine&s;s of a King requires him to know it thoroughly: wherefore, the different parts by unnaturally oppo&s;ing and de&s;troying each other, prove the whole character to be ab&s;urd and u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Some writers have explained the Engli&s;h con&s;titution thus; the King &s;ay they is one, the People another; the Peers are an hou&s;e in behalf of the King; the Commons in behalf of the People; But this hath all the di&s;tinctions of an hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf; and tho' the expre&s;&s;ions be plea&s;antly arranged, yet when examined they appear idle and ambiguous: and it will always happen, that the nice&s;t con&s;truction that words are capable of, when applied to the
<PB N="6" REF="9">de&s;cription of &s;ome thing which either cannot exi&s;t, or is too incomprehen&s;ible to be within the compa&s;s of de&s;crip|tion, will be words of &s;ound only, and tho' they may amu&s;e the ear, they cannot inform the mind: for this explanation includes a previous que&s;tion, viz. <HI>how came the King by a power which the People are afraid to tru&s;t and always obliged to check?</HI> Such a power could not be the gift of a wi&s;e People, neither can any Power <HI>which needs checking</HI> be from God: yet the provi&s;ion which the con&s;titution makes, &s;uppo&s;es &s;uch a power to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>But the provi&s;ion is unequal to the ta&s;k, the means either cannot, or will not accompli&s;h the end, and the whole affair is a <HI>Felo de &s;e:</HI> for as the greater weight will always carry up the le&s;s, and as all the wheels of a machine are put in motion by one, it only remains to know which power in the con&s;titution has the mo&s;t weight, for that will govern: and tho' the others, or a part of them, may clog, or check the rapidity of its motion, yet &s;o long as they cannot &s;top it, their endeavours will be ineffectual: the fir&s;t moving power will at la&s;t have its way, and what it wants in &s;peed will be &s;upplied by time.</P>
<P>That the crown is this overbearing part in the Engli&s;h con&s;titution needs not be mentioned, and that it derives its whole con&s;equence merely from being the giver of places and pen&s;ions is &s;elf-evident, wherefore, tho' we have been wi&s;e enough to lock the door again&s;t ab&s;olute Monarchy, we at the &s;ame time have been fooli&s;h enough to put the Crown in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the key.</P>
<P>The prejudice of Engli&s;hmen in favour of their own government by King, Lords and Commons, ari&s;es as much or more from national pride than rea&s;on. Individuals are undoubtedly &s;afer in England than in &s;ome other Countries: but the <HI>will</HI> of the King is as much the <HI>law</HI> of the land in Britain as in France, with this difference, that in&s;tead of proceeding directly from his mouth, it is handed to the People under the more formidable &s;hape of an act of Par|liament. For the fare of Charles the fir&s;t hath only made Kings more &s;ubtle&mdash;not more ju&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">Wherefore laying a&s;ide all national pride and prejudice in favour of modes and forms, the plain truth is, that <HI>it is wholly owing to the con&s;titution of the People, and not to the con&s;titution of the Government</HI> that the Crown is not as oppre&s;&s;ive in England as in Turkey.</P>
<P>An enquiry into the <HI>con&s;titutional errors</HI> in the Engli&s;h form of government, is at this time highly nece&s;&s;ary; for as we are never in a proper condition of doing ju&s;tice to others, while we continue under the influence of &s;ome leading partiality, &s;o neither are we capable of doing it to our&s;elves while we remain fettered by any ob&s;tinate pre|judice. And as a man who is attached to a pro&s;titute is unfitted to choo&s;e or judge of a wife, &s;o any prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of a rotten con&s;titution of government will di&s;able us from di&s;cerning a good one.</P>

<HEAD>Of <HI>MONARCHY</HI> and hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND being originally equals in the order of creation, the equality could only be de&s;troyed by &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent circum&s;tance: the di&s;tinctions of rich and poor may in a great mea&s;ure be accounted for, and that without having recour&s;e to the har&s;h ill-&s;ounding names of oppre&s;&s;ion and avarice. Oppre&s;&s;ion is often the <HI>con&s;equence,</HI> but &s;eldom or never the <HI>means</HI> of riches: and tho' avarice will pre&s;erve a man from being nece&s;&s;itou&s;ly poor, it generally makes him too timorous to be wealthy.</P>
<P>But there is another and greater di&s;tinction for which no truly natural or religious rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, and that is, the di&s;tinction of Men into KINGS and SUBJECTS. Male and female are the di&s;tinctions of nature, good and bad the di&s;tinctions of Heaven; but how a race of Men came into the World &s;o exalted above the re&s;t, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed like &s;ome new &s;pecies, is worth enquiring into, and whether they are the means of happine&s;s or of mi&s;ery to mankind.</P>
<P>In the early ages of the World according to the Scrip|ture chronology there were no Kings; the con&s;equence
<PB N="8" REF="11">of which was there were no wars; it is the pride of Kings which throws mankind into confu&s;ion. Holland without a King hath enjoyed more peace for this la&s;t century, than any of the Monarchical governments in Europe. Anti|quity favours the remark; for the quiet and rural lives of the fir&s;t Patriarchs hath a happy &s;omething in them, which vani&s;hes away when we come to the hi&s;tory of Jewi&s;h royalty.</P>
<P>Government by Kings was fir&s;t introduced into the World by the Heathens, from whom the children of I&s;rael copied the cu&s;tom. It was the mo&s;t pro&s;perous invention the Devil ever &s;et on foot for the promotion of idolatry. The Heathens paid divine honors to their decea&s;ed Kings, and the Chri&s;tian World hath improved on the plan by doing the &s;ame to their living ones. How impious is the title of &s;acred Maje&s;ty applied to a worm, who in the mid&s;t of his &s;plendor is crumbling into du&s;t!</P>
<P>As the exalting one man &s;o greatly above the re&s;t cannot be ju&s;tified on the equal right of nature, &s;o neither can it be defended on the authority of &s;cripture; for the will of the Almighty, as declared by Gideon and the prophet Samuel, expre&s;sly di&s;approves of Government by Kings. All anti-monarchical parts of &s;cripture have been very &s;moothly glo&s;&s;ed over in monarchical governments, but they undoubtedly merit the attention of Countries which have their governments yet to form. <HI>"Render unto Cae&s;ar the things which are Cae&s;ar's,"</HI> is the &s;cripture doctrine of Courts, yet it is no &s;upport of monarchical government, for the Jews at that time were without a King and in a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage to the Romans.</P>
<P>Near three thou&s;and years pa&s;&s;ed away from the Mo&s;aic account of the creation, till the Jews under a national delu&s;ion reque&s;ted a king. Till then, their form of government (except in extraordinary ca&s;es where the Almighty interpo&s;ed) was a kind of republic admini&s;tred by a judge and the elders of the tribes. Kings they had none, and it was held &s;inful to acknowledge any Being
<PB N="9" REF="12">under that title but the Lord of Ho&s;ts. And when a man &s;eriou&s;ly reflects on the idolatrous homage which is paid to the per&s;ons of kings, he need not wonder that the Almighty, ever jealous of his honour, &s;hould di&s;approve of a form of government which &s;o impiou&s;ly invades the prerogative of Heaven.</P>
<P>Monarchy is ranked in &s;cripture as one of the &s;ins of the Jews, for which a cur&s;e in re&s;erve is denounced again&s;t them. The hi&s;tory of that tran&s;action is worth attending to.</P>
<P>The children of I&s;rael being oppre&s;&s;ed by the Midia|nites, Gideon marched again&s;t them with a &s;mall army, and victory thro' the Divine interpo&s;ition decided in his favour. The Jews elate with &s;ucce&s;s, and attributing it to the ge|neral&s;hip of Gideon, propo&s;ed making him a king; &s;aying, <HI>Rule thou over us, thou and thy &s;on and thy &s;on's &s;on.</HI> Here was temptation in its fulle&s;t extent; not a kingdom only, but an hereditary one, but Gideon in the piety of his &s;oul replied, <HI>I will not rule over you, neither &s;hall my &s;on rule over you.</HI> The LORD SHALL RULE OVER YOU. Words need not be more explicit; Gideon doth not <HI>decline</HI> the honour, but denieth their right to give it; neither doth he compliment them with invented declarations of his thanks, but in the po&s;itive &s;tile of a prophet charges them with di&s;affection to their proper Sovereign, the King of Heaven.</P>
<P>About one hundred and thirty years after this, they fell again into the &s;ame error. The hankering which the Jews had for the idolatrous cu&s;toms of the Heathens, is &s;ome|thing exceedingly unaccountable; but &s;o it was, that laying hold of the mi&s;conduct of Samuel's two &s;ons, who were entru&s;ted with &s;ome &s;ecular concerns, they came in an abrupt and clamorous manner to Samuel, &s;aying, <HI>behold thou art old, and thy &s;ons walk not in thy ways, now make us a king to judge us like all the other nations.</HI> And here we cannot but ob&s;erve that their motives were bad, viz. that they might be <HI>like</HI> unto other nations, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Heathens, whereas their their true glory lay in being as much <HI>unlike</HI> them as po&s;&s;ible. <HI>But the thing di&s;plea&s;ed Samuel when they &s;aid, give us a
<PB N="10" REF="13">King to judge us: and Samuel prayed unto the Lord, and the Lord &s;aid unto Samuel, hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they &s;ay unto thee, for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me,</HI> THAT I SHOULD NOT REIGN OVER THEM. <HI>According to all the works which they have done &s;ince the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have for&s;aken me and &s;erved other Gods: &s;o do they al&s;o unto thee. Now therefore hearken unto their voice, howbeit, prote&s;t &s;olemnly unto them and &s;hew them the manner of the King that &s;hall reign over them, i. e.</HI> not of any particular King, but of the general manner of the Kings of the Earth whom I&s;rael was &s;o eargerly copying after. And notwith&s;tanding the great di&s;tance of time and difference of manners, the cha|racter is &s;till in fa&s;hion. <HI>And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the People, that a&s;ked of him a King. And he &s;aid this &s;hall be the manner of the King that &s;hall reign over you. He will take your &s;ons and appoint them for him&s;elf, for his chariots and to be his hor&s;e-men, and &s;ome &s;hall run before his chariots.</HI> (This de&s;cription agrees with the pre&s;ent mode of impre&s;&s;ing men) <HI>And he will appoint him captains over thou&s;ands and captains over fi&s;ties, will &s;et them to ear his ground and to reap his harve&s;t, and to make his in&s;truments of war, and in&s;truments of his chariots. And he will take your daughters to be confectio|naries and to be cooks, and to be bakers.</HI> (This de&s;cribes the expence and luxury as well as the oppre&s;&s;ion of Kings) <HI>And he will take your fields and your vineyards, and your olive-yards, even the be&s;t of them, and give them to his &s;ervants. And he will take the tenth of your &s;eed, and of your vineyards, and give them to his officers and to his &s;er|vants.</HI> (By which we &s;ee that bribery, corruption, and favouriti&s;m, are the &s;tanding vices of Kings) <HI>And he will take the tenth of your men &s;ervants, and your maid &s;ervants, and your goodlie&s;t young men and your a&s;&s;es, and put them to his work; and he will take the tenth of your &s;heep, and ye &s;hall be his &s;ervants, and ye &s;hall cry out in that day
<PB N="11" REF="14">becau&s;e of your King which ye &s;hall have cho&s;en,</HI> AND THE LORD WILL NOT HEAR YOU IN THAT DAY. This accounts for the continuation of Monarchy; neither do the characters of the few good Kings which have lived &s;ince, either &s;anctify the title, or blot out the &s;infulne&s;s of the origin; the high encomium given of David takes no notice of him <HI>officially as a King,</HI> but only as a <HI>Man</HI> after God's own heart. <HI>Neverthele&s;s the People refu&s;ed to obey the voice of Samuel, and they &s;aid nay but we will have a King over us, that we may be like all the nations, and that our King may judge us, and go out before us and fight our battles.</HI> Samuel continued to rea&s;on with them but to no purpo&s;e, he &s;et before them their ingratitude, but all would not avail, and &s;eeing them fully bent on their folly, he cried out, <HI>I will call unto the Lord and he &s;hall &s;end thunder and rain</HI> (which then was a puni&s;hment, being in the time of wheat harve&s;t) <HI>that ye may perceive and &s;ee that your wickedne&s;s is great which ye have done in the &s;ight of the Lord,</HI> IN ASKING YOU A KING. <HI>So Samuel called unto the Lord, and the Lord &s;ent thunder and rain that day, and all the prople greatly feared the Lord and Samuel. And all the people &s;aid unto Samuel, pray for thy &s;ervants unto the Lord thy God, that we die not, for</HI> WE HAVE ADDED UNTO OUR SINS THIS EVIL, TO ASK A KING. The&s;e portions of &s;cripture are direct and po&s;itive. They admit of no equivocal con&s;truction. That the Almighty hath here entered his prote&s;t again&s;t mo|narchical government is true, or the &s;cripture is fal&s;e. And a man hath good rea&s;on to believe that there is as much of king-craft as prie&s;t-craft, in with-holding the &s;cripture from the public in popi&s;h countries. For mo|narchy in every in&s;tance is the popery of government.</P>
<P>To the evil of monarchy we have added that of here|ditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and as the fir&s;t is a degradation and le&s;&s;ening of our&s;elves, &s;o the &s;econd, claimed as a matter of right, is an in&s;ult and an impo&s;ition on po&s;terity. For all men being originally equals, no <HI>one</HI> by <HI>birth</HI> could
<PB N="12" REF="15">have a right to &s;et up his own family in preference to all others for ever, and tho' him&s;elf might de&s;erve <HI>&s;ome</HI> decent degree of honours of his cotemporaries, yet his de&s;cendants might be far too unworthy to inherit them. One of the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>natural</HI> proofs of the folly of here|ditary right in kings, is, that nature di&s;approves it, other|wi&s;e &s;he would not &s;o frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an <HI>a&s;s for a lion.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, as no man at fir&s;t could po&s;&s;e&s;s any other public honours than were be&s;towed upon him, &s;o the givers of tho&s;e honours could have no power to give away the right of po&s;terity, and though they might &s;ay, "we choo&s;e you for our head," they could not without manife&s;t inju&s;tice to their children &s;ay "that your children and your children's children &s;hall reign over our's forever." Becau&s;e &s;uch an unwi&s;e, unju&s;t, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next &s;ucce&s;&s;ion put them under the go|vernment of a rogue or a fool. Mo&s;t wi&s;e men in their private &s;entiments have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of tho&s;e evils, which when once e&s;tabli&s;hed is not ea&s;ily removed: many &s;ubmit from fear, others from &s;uper&s;tition, and the more powerful part &s;hares with the king the plunder of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>This is &s;uppo&s;ing the pre&s;ent race of kings in the world to have had an honourable origin: whereas it is more than probable, that could we take off the dark covering of an|tiquity and trace them to their fir&s;t ri&s;e, that we &s;hould find the fir&s;t, of them nothing better than the principal ruffian of &s;ome re&s;tle&s;s gang, who&s;e &s;avage manners or pre-emi|nence in &s;ubtilty obtained him the title of chief among plunderers; and who by increa&s;ing in power and extend|ing his depredations, over-awed the quiet and defencele&s;s to purcha&s;e their &s;afety by frequent contributions. Yet his electors could have no idea of giving hereditary right to his de&s;cendants, becau&s;e &s;uch a perpetual exclu&s;ion of them&s;elves was incompatible with the free and unre&s;train|ed principles they profe&s;&s;ed to live by. Wherefore here|ditary
<PB N="13" REF="16">&s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the early ages of monarchy could not take place as a matter of claim, but as &s;omething ca&s;ual or complimental; but as few or no records were extant in tho&s;e days, and traditionary hi&s;tory &s;tuff'd with fables, it was very ea&s;y after the lap&s;e of a few generations, to trump up &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious tale conveniently timed, Ma|homet like, to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar. Perhaps the di&s;orders which threatned, or &s;eemed to threaten, on the decea&s;e of a leader and the choice of a new one (for elections among ruffians could not be very orderly) induced many at fir&s;t to favor here|ditary preten&s;ions; by which means it happened, as it hath happened &s;ince, that what at fir&s;t was &s;ubmitted to as a convenience was afterwards claimed as a right.</P>
<P>England &s;ince the conque&s;t hath known &s;ome few good monarchs, but groaned beneath a much larger number of bad ones: yet no man in his &s;en&s;es can &s;ay that their claim under William the Conqueror is a very honourable one. A French Ba&s;tard landing with an armed Banditti and e&s;tabli&s;hing him&s;elf king of England again&s;t the con|&s;ent of the natives, is in plain terms a very paltry, ra&s;cally original.&mdash;It certainly hath no divinity in it. However it is needle&s;s to expend much time in expo&s;ing the folly of hereditary right, if there are any &s;o weak as to believe it, let them promi&s;cuou&s;ly wor&s;hip the A&s;s and Lion and welcome. I &s;hall neither copy their humility nor di&s;turb their devotion.</P>
<P>Yet I &s;hould be glad to a&s;k how they &s;uppo&s;e Kings came at fir&s;t? the que&s;tion admits but of three an&s;wers, viz. either by lot, by election, or by u&s;urpation. If the fir&s;t king was taken by lot, it e&s;tabli&s;hes a precedent for the next, which excludes hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Saul was by lot, yet the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was not hereditary, neither does it appear from that tran&s;action there was any intention it ever &s;hould. If the fir&s;t king of any country was by election that likewi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hes a precedent for the next; for to &s;ay that the right of all future generations is taken
<PB N="14" REF="17">away by the act of the fir&s;t electors in their choice not only of a king, but of a family of kings for ever, hath no parallel in or out of &s;cripture but the doctrine of original &s;in, which &s;uppo&s;es the free will of all men lo&s;t in Adam: and from &s;uch compari&s;on, and it will admit of no other, hereditary right can derive no glory. For as in Adam all &s;inned, and as in the fir&s;t electors all men obeyed; as in the one all mankind were &s;ubjected to Satan, and in the other to &s;overeignty; as our innocence was lo&s;t in the fir&s;t, and our authority in the la&s;t; and as both di&s;able us from re|a&s;&s;uming &s;ome former &s;tate and privilege, it unan&s;werably follows that original &s;in and hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion are parallels. Di&s;honourable rank! inglorious connection! yet the mo&s;t &s;ubtle &s;ophi&s;t cannot produce a ju&s;ter &s;imile.</P>
<P>As to u&s;urpation no man will be &s;o hardy as to defend it; and that William the conqueror was an u&s;urper is a fact not to be contradicted. The plain truth is, that the antiquity of Engli&s;h monarchy will not bear looking into.</P>
<P>But it is not &s;o much the ab&s;urdity as the evil of here|ditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion which concerns mankind. Did it en&s;ure a race of good and wi&s;e men it would have the &s;eal of divine authority, but as it opens a door to the <HI>fooli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>wicked</HI> and the <HI>improper,</HI> it hath in it the nature of op|pre&s;&s;ion. Men who look upon them&s;elves born to reign, and others to obey, &s;oon grow in&s;olent&mdash;&s;elected from the re&s;t of mankind their minds are ea&s;ily poi&s;oned by impor|tance; and the world they act in differs &s;o very materially from the world at large, that they have but little oppor|tunity of knowing its true intere&s;ts, and when they &s;ucceed to the government are frequently the mo&s;t ignorant and unfit of any throughout the dominions.</P>
<P>Another evil which attends hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is, that the throne is &s;ubject to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a minor at any age; all which time the regency acting under the cover of a king have every opportunity and inducement to betray their tru&s;t. The &s;ame national misfortune happens when a king worn out with age and infirmity enters the la&s;t &s;tage of human
<PB N="15" REF="18">weakne&s;s. In both the&s;e ca&s;es the public becomes a prey to every mi&s;creant who can tamper &s;ucce&s;sfully with the follies either of age or infancy.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t plau&s;ible plea which hath ever been offered in favour of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is, that it pre&s;erves a Nation from civil wars; and were this true it would be weighty; whereas it is the mo&s;t barefaced fal&s;ity ever impo&s;ed upon mankind. The whole hi&s;tory of England di&s;owns the fact. Thirty kings and two minors have reigned in that di&s;tract|ed kingdom &s;ince the conque&s;t, in which time there has been (including the Revolution) no le&s;s than eight civil wars and nineteen Rebellions. Wherefore in&s;tead of making for peace, it makes again&s;t it, and de&s;troys the very foundation it &s;eems to &s;tand on.</P>
<P>The conte&s;t for monarchy and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter laid England in a &s;cene of blood for many years. Twelve pitched battles be&s;ides &s;kir|mi&s;hes and &s;ieges were fought between Henry and Edward. Twice was Henry pri&s;oner to Edward, who in his turn was pri&s;oner to Henry. And &s;o uncertain is the fate of war and the temper of a Nation, when nothing but per&s;onal matters are the ground of a quarrel, that Henry was taken in triumph from a pri&s;on to a palace, and Edward obliged to fly from a palace to a foreign land. Yet as &s;udden tran&s;itions of temper are &s;eldom la&s;ting, Henry in his turn was driven from the throne and Edward recalled to &s;ucceed him. The parliament always following the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ide.</P>
<P>This conte&s;t began in the reign of Henry the 6th, and was not entirely extingui&s;hed till Henry the 7th, in whom the families were united. Including a period of 67 years, viz. from 1422 to 1489.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, monarchy and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion have laid (not this or that kingdom only) but the world in blood and a&s;hes. 'Tis a form of government which the word of God bears te&s;timony again&s;t, and blood will attend it.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19">If we enquire into the bu&s;ine&s;s of a King we &s;hall find that in &s;ome countries they have none; and after &s;aunter|ing away their lives without plea&s;ure to them&s;elves or ad|vantage to the nation, withdraw from the &s;cene and leave their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to tread the &s;ame idle round. In ab&s;olute monarchies the whole weight of bu&s;ine&s;s civil and military lies on the King; the children of I&s;rael in their reque&s;t for a King urged this plea "that he may judge us, and go out before us and fight our battles." But in countries where he is neither a judge nor a general, as in England, a man would be puzzled to know what is his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The nearer any government approaches to a republic the le&s;s bu&s;ine&s;s there is for a King. It is &s;omewhat difficult to find a proper name for the government of England. Sir William Meredith calls it a Republic; but in its pre|&s;ent &s;tate it is unworthy of the name, becau&s;e the corrupt influence of the Crown by having all the places in its di&s;|po&s;al, hath &s;o effectually &s;wallowed up the power and eaten out the virtue of the Hou&s;e of Commons (the Republican part of the con&s;titution) that the government of England is nearly as monarchical as that of France or Spain. Men fall out with names without under&s;tanding them. For 'tis the republican and not the monarchical part of the con&s;ti|tution of England which Engli&s;hmen glory in, viz. the liberty of choo&s;ing an hou&s;e of commons from out of their own body&mdash;and it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that when republican vir|tue fails, &s;lavery en&s;ues. Why is the con&s;titution of Eng|land &s;ickly? but becau&s;e monarchy hath poi&s;oned the re|public; the crown hath engro&s;&s;ed the commons.</P>
<P>In England a King hath little more to do than to make war and have away places; which in plain terms, is to impoveri&s;h the nation and &s;et it together by the ears. A pretty bu&s;i|ne&s;s indeed for a man to be allowed eight hundred thou|&s;and &s;terling a year for, and wor&s;hipped into the bargain! Of more worth is one hone&s;t man to &s;ociety and in the &s;ight of God, than all the crowned ruffians that ever lived.</P>

<HEAD>THOUGHTS on the pre&s;ent STATE of AMERICAN AFFAIRS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the following pages I offer nothing more than &s;imple facts, plain arguments, and common &s;en&s;e: and have no other preliminaries to &s;ettle with the reader, than that he will dive&s;t him&s;elf of prejudice and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;uffer his rea&s;on and his feelings to determine for them|&s;elves: that he will put on, or rather that he will not put off, the true character of a man, and generou&s;ly enlarge his views beyond the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>Volumes have been written on the &s;ubject of the &s;trug|gle between England and America. Men of all ranks have embarked in the controver&s;y, from different motives and with various de&s;igns; but all have been ineffectual and the period of debate is clo&s;ed. Arms as the la&s;t re|&s;ource decide the conte&s;t; the appeal was the choice of the King, and the continent has accepted the challenge.</P>
<P>It hath been reported of the late Mr. Pelham (who tho' an able mini&s;ter was not without his faults) that on his being attacked in the Hou&s;e of Commons on the &s;core that his mea&s;ures were only of a temporary kind, replied, <HI>"they will la&s;t my time."</HI> Should a thought &s;o fatal and un|manly po&s;&s;e&s;s the Colonies in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, the name of Ance&s;tors will be remembered by future gene|rations with dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>The Sun never &s;hined on a cau&s;e of greater worth. 'Tis not the affair of a City, a County, a Province or a King|dom; but of a Continent&mdash;of at lea&s;t one eighth part of the habitable globe. 'Tis not the concern of a day, a year, or an age; po&s;terity are virtually involved in the conte&s;t, and will be more or le&s;s affected even to the end of time by the proceedings now. Now is the &s;eed time of continental union, faith and honor. The lea&s;t fracture now, will be like a name engraved with the point of a pin on the tender find of a young oak; the wound will en|large with the tree, and pro&s;terity read it in full grown characters.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="21">By referring the matter from argument to arms, a new aera for politics is &s;truck&mdash;a new method of thinking hath ari&s;en. All plans, propo&s;als, &amp;c. prior to the 19th of April, <HI>i. e.</HI> to the commencement of ho&s;tilities, are like the almanacks of the la&s;t year; which tho' proper then, are &s;uperceded and u&s;ele&s;s now. Whatever was advanced by the advocates on either &s;ide of the que&s;tion then, ter|minated in one and the &s;ame point, viz. a union with Great Britain; the only difference between the parties, was the method of effecting it; the one propo&s;ing force, the other friend&s;hip; but it hath &s;o far happened that the fir&s;t hath failed, and the &s;econd hath withdrawn her influence.</P>
<P>As much hath been &s;aid of the advantages of reconci|liation, which, like an agreeable dream, hath pa&s;&s;ed away and left us as we were, it is but right, that we &s;hould examine the contrary &s;ide of the argument, and enquire into &s;ome of the many material injuries which the&s;e Colo|nies &s;u&s;tain, and always will &s;u&s;tain, by being connected with and dependant on Great Britain. To examine that connection and dependance on the principles of nature and common &s;en&s;e, to &s;ee what we have to tru&s;t to if &s;eparated, and what we are to expect if dependant.</P>
<P>I have heard it a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome, that as America hath flouri&s;hed under her former connection with Great Britain, that the &s;ame connection it nece&s;&s;ary towards her future happine&s;s and will always have the &s;ame effect&mdash;Nothing can be more fallacious than this kind of argument:&mdash; we may as well a&s;&s;ert that becau&s;e a child hath thrived upon milk, that it is never to have meat, or that the fir&s;t twenty years of our lives is to become a precedent for the next twenty. But even this is admitting more than is true, for I an&s;wer, roundly, that America would have flouri&s;hed as much, and probably much more, had no European power taken any notice of her. The commerce by which &s;he hath enriched her&s;elf are the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and will always have a market while eating is the cu&s;tom of Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="22">But &s;he hath protected us, &s;ay &s;ome. That &s;he has engro&s;&s;ed us is true, and defended the Continent at our expence as well as her own is admitted; and &s;he would have defended Turkey from the &s;ame motive, viz. the &s;ake of trade and dominion.</P>
<P>Alas! we have been long led away by ancient prejudices and made large &s;acrifices to &s;uper&s;tition. We have boa&s;ted the protection of Great Britain, without con&s;idering, that her motive was <HI>intere&s;t</HI> not <HI>attachment;</HI> that &s;he did not protect us from <HI>our enemies</HI> on <HI>our account,</HI> but from <HI>her enemies</HI> on her <HI>own account,</HI> from tho&s;e who had no quarrel with us on any <HI>other account,</HI> and who will always be our enemies on the <HI>&s;ame account.</HI> Let Britain wave her pre|ten&s;ions to the continent, or the continent throw off the dependance, and we &s;hould be at peace with France and Spain were they at war with Britain. The mi&s;eries of Hanover la&s;t war ought to warn us again&s;t connections.</P>
<P>It hath lately been a&s;&s;erted in Parliament, that the colo|nies have no relation to each other but through the pa|rent country, <HI>i. e.</HI> that Penn&s;ylvania and the Jer&s;eys and &s;o on for the re&s;t, are &s;i&s;ter colonies by the way of England; this is certainly a very round about way of proving re|lation&s;hip, but it is the neare&s;t and only true way of proving enemy&s;hip, if I may &s;o call it. France and Spain never were, nor perhaps ever will be our enemies as <HI>Americans,</HI> but as our being the <HI>&s;ubjects of Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>But Britain is the parent country &s;ay &s;ome. Then the more the &s;hame upon her conduct. Even brutes do not devour their young, nor &s;avages make war upon their families; wherefore the a&s;&s;ertion, if true, turns to her re|proach; but it happens not to be true, or only partly &s;o, and the phra&s;e, <HI>parent</HI> or <HI>mother-country,</HI> hath been je&s;uiti|cally adopted by the King and his para&s;ites, with a low pa|pi&s;tical de&s;ign of gaining an unfair bias on the credulous weakne&s;s of our minds. Europe and not England is the parent country of America. This new world hath been the a&s;ylum for the per&s;ecuted lovers of civil and religious
<PB N="20" REF="23">liberty from <HI>every part</HI> of Europe. Hither have they fled, not from the tender embraces of the mother, but from the cruelty of the mon&s;ter; and it is &s;o far true of England, that the &s;ame tyranny which drove the fir&s;t emigrants from home, pur&s;ues their de&s;cendants &s;till.</P>
<P>In this exten&s;ive quarter of the globe, we forget the narrow limits of three hundred and &s;ixty miles (the extent of England) and carry our friend&s;hip on a larger &s;cale; we claim brotherhood with every European Chri&s;tian, and triumph in the genero&s;ity of the &s;entiment.</P>
<P>It is plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve by what regular gradations we &s;urmount the force of local prejudice as we enlarge our acquaintance with the world. A man born in any town in England divided into pari&s;hes, will naturally a&s;&s;ociate mo&s;t with his fellow pari&s;hioners (becau&s;e their intere&s;ts in many ca&s;es will be common) and di&s;tingui&s;h him by the name of <HI>neighbour:</HI> if he meet him but a few miles from home, he drops the narrow idea of a &s;treet, and &s;alutes him by the name of <HI>town&s;man:</HI> if he travel out of the county and meet him in any other, he forgets the minor divi&s;ions of &s;treet and town, and calls him <HI>country-man.</HI> i. e. <HI>county-man:</HI> but if in their foreign excur&s;ions they &s;hould a&s;&s;ociate in France, or any other part of <HI>Europe,</HI> their local remem|brance would be enlarged into that of <HI>Engli&s;hmen.</HI> And by a ju&s;t parity of rea&s;oning, all Europeans meeting in America, or any other quarter of the Globe, are <HI>country|men;</HI> for England, Holland, Germany, or Sweden, when compared with the whole, &s;tand in the &s;ame places on the larger &s;cale, which the divi&s;ions of &s;treet, town, and county do on the &s;maller one; Di&s;tinctions too limited for Con|tinental minds. Not one third of the inhabitants, even of this province, are of Engli&s;h de&s;cent. Wherefore, I reprobate the phra&s;e of parent or mother country ap|plied to England only, as being fal&s;e, &s;elfi&s;h, narrow and ungenerous.</P>
<P>But admitting that we were all of Engli&s;h de&s;cent, what does it amount to? Nothing. Britain being now an open
<PB N="21" REF="24">enemy, extingui&s;hes every other name and title: and to &s;ay that reconciliation is our duty, is truly farcical. The fir&s;t king of England, of the pre&s;ent line (William the Conqueror) was a Frenchman, and half the Peers of Eng|land are de&s;cendants from the &s;ame country; wherefore, by the &s;ame method of rea&s;oning, England ought to be governed by France.</P>
<P>Much hath been &s;aid of the united &s;trength of Britain and the Colonies, that in conjunction, they might bid de|fiance to the world: But this is mere pre&s;umption, the fate of war is uncertain, neither do the expre&s;&s;ions mean any thing, for this Continent would never &s;uffer it&s;elf to be drained of inhabitants, to &s;upport the Briti&s;h Arms in either A&s;ia, Africa, or Europe.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, what have we to do with &s;etting the world at defiance. Our plan is commerce, and that well attended to, will &s;ecure us the peace and friend&s;hip of Europe, becau&s;e it is the intere&s;t of all Europe to have America a <HI>free port.</HI> Her trade will always be a protection, and her barrenne&s;s of gold and &s;ilver will &s;ecure her from invaders.</P>
<P>I challenge the warme&s;t advocate for reconciliation, to &s;hew a &s;ingle advantage that this Continent can reap, by being connected with Great Britain. I repeat the chal|lenge, not a &s;ingle advantage is derived. Our corn will fetch its price in any market in Europe, and our imported goods mu&s;t be paid for, buy them where we will.</P>
<P>But the injuries and di&s;advantages we &s;u&s;tain by that connection, are without number, and our duty to mankind at large, as well as to our&s;elves, in&s;truct us to renounce the alliance: Becau&s;e any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to, or dependance on Great Britain, tends directly to involve this Continent in European wars and quarrels. As Europe is our market for trade, we ought to form no political connections with any part of it. 'Tis the true intere&s;t of America, to &s;teer clear of European contentions, which &s;he never can do, while by her dependance on Britain, &s;he is made the make-weight in the &s;cale of Briti&s;h politics.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="25">Europe is too thickly planted with Kingdoms to be long at peace, and whenever a war breaks out between England and any foreign power, the trade of America goes to ruin, <HI>becau&s;e of her connection with Britain.</HI> The next war may not turn out like the la&s;t, and &s;hould it not, the advocates for reconciliation now, will be wi&s;hing for &s;eparation then, becau&s;e neutrality in that ca&s;e, would be a &s;afer convoy than a man of war. Every thing that is right or rea&s;onable pleads for &s;eparation. The blood of the &s;lain, the weeping voice of nature cries, 'TIS TIME TO PART. Even the di&s;tance at which the Almighty hath placed England and America, is a &s;trong and natural proof, that the authority of the one over the other, was never the de&s;ign of Heaven. The time likewi&s;e at which the Continent was di&s;covered, adds weight to the argu|ment, and the manner in which it was peopled encrea&s;es the force of it.&mdash;The Reformation was preceded by the di&s;covery of America; as if the Almighty graciou&s;ly meant to open a &s;anctuary to the per&s;ecuted in future years, when home &s;hould afford neither friend&s;hip nor &s;afety.</P>
<P>The authority of Great Britain over this Continent is a form of government which &s;ooner or later mu&s;t have an end. And a &s;erious mind can draw no true plea&s;ure by looking forward, under the painful and po&s;itive conviction, that what he calls "the pre&s;ent con&s;titution," is merely tem|porary. As parents, we can have no joy, knowing that <HI>this government</HI> is not &s;ufficiently la&s;ting to en&s;ure any thing which we may bequeath to po&s;terity: And by a plain method of argument, as we are running the next genera|tion into debt, we ought to do the work of it, otherwi&s;e we u&s;e them meanly and pitifully. In order to di&s;cover the line of our duty rightly, we &s;hould take our children in our hand, and fix our &s;tation a few years farther into life; that eminence will pre&s;ent a pro&s;pect, which a few pre&s;ent fears and prejudices conceal from our &s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26">Though I would carefully avoid giving unnece&s;&s;ary offence, yet I am inclined to believe, that all tho&s;e who e&s;pou&s;e the doctrine of reconciliation, may be included within the following de&s;criptions.

<P>This is not inflaming or exaggerating matters, but trying them by tho&s;e feelings and affections which nature ju&s;tifies, and without which, we &s;hould be incapable of di&s;charging the &s;ocial duties of life, or enjoying the felicities of it. I mean not to exhibit horror for the purpo&s;e of provoking revenge, but to awaken us from fatal and unmanly &s;lumbers, that we may pur&s;ue determinately &s;ome fixed object. 'Tis not in the power of England or of Europe to conquer Ame|rica, if &s;he doth not conquer her&s;elf by <HI>delay</HI> and <HI>timidity.</HI> The pre&s;ent winter is worth an age if rightly employed, but if lo&s;t or neglected, the whole continent will partake of the misfortune; and there is no puni&s;hment which that man doth not de&s;erve, be he who, or what or where he will, that may be the means of &s;acrificing a &s;ea&s;on &s;o pre|cious and u&s;eful.</P>
<P>'Tis repugnant to rea&s;on, to the univer&s;al order of things; to all examples from former ages, to &s;uppo&s;e, that this continent can long remain &s;ubject to any external power. The mo&s;t &s;anguine in Britain doth not think &s;o. The utmo&s;t &s;tretch of human wi&s;dom cannot, at this time, compa&s;s a plan, &s;hort of &s;eparation, which can promi&s;e the continent even a year's &s;ecurity. Reconciliation is <HI>now</HI> a fallacious dream. Nature hath de&s;erted the con|nection, and art cannot &s;upply her place.

<P><PB N="25" REF="28">Every quiet method for peace hath been ineffectual.

<P>As to government matters, 'tis not in the power of Britain to do the Continent ju&s;tice: The bu&s;ine&s;s of it will &s;oon be too weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of convenience, by a power &s;o di&s;tant from us, and &s;o very ignorant of us; for if they cannot conquer us they cannot govern us. To be always running three or four thou&s;and miles with a tale or a petition, waiting four or five months for an an&s;wer, which when obtained requires five or &s;ix more to explain it in, will in a few years be looked upon as folly and childi&s;hne&s;s&mdash; There was a time when it was proper, and there is a proper time for it to cea&s;e.</P>
<P>Small i&s;lands not capable of protecting them&s;elves, are the proper objects for government to take under their care: but there is &s;omething very ab&s;urd in &s;uppo&s;ing a Continent to be perpetually governed by an i&s;land. In no in&s;tance hath nature made the &s;atellite larger than its primary planet, and as England and America, with re&s;pect to each other, rever&s;e the common order of nature, it is evident they belong to different &s;y&s;tems. England to Europe: America to it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="29">I am not induced by motives of pride, party or re&s;entment to e&s;pou&s;e the doctrine of &s;eparation and independance; I am clearly, po&s;itively, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly per&s;uaded that 'tis the true intere&s;t of this continent to be &s;o; that every thing &s;hort of that is mere patchwork, that it can afford no la&s;ting felicity&mdash;that it is leaving the &s;word to our children, and &s;hrinking back at a time, when a little more, a little farther, would have rendered this continent the glory of the earth.</P>
<P>As Britain hath not manife&s;ted the lea&s;t inclination to|wards a compromi&s;e, we may be a&s;&s;ured that no terms can be obtained worthy the acceptance of the continent, or any ways equal to the expence of blood and trea&s;ure we have been already put to.</P>
<P>The object contended for, ought always to bear &s;ome ju&s;t proportion to the expence. The removal of North, or the whole dete&s;table junto, is a matter unworthy of the mil|lions we have expended. A temporary &s;toppage of trade was an inconvenience, which would have &s;ufficiently bal|lanced &s;he repeal of all the acts complained of, had &s;uch repeals been obtained; but if the whole Continent mu&s;t take up arms, if every man mu&s;t be a &s;oldier, 'tis &s;carcely worth our while to fight again&s;t a contemptible mini&s;try only. Dearly, dearly do we pay for the repeal of the acts, if that is all we fight for; for in a ju&s;t e&s;timation, 'tis as great a folly to pay a bunker-hill price for law as for land. As I have always con&s;idered the independancy of this Continent as an event which &s;ooner or later mu&s;t arrive, &s;o from the late rapid progre&s;s of the Continent to maturity, the event could not be &s;ar off. Wherefore on the breaking out of ho&s;tilities, it was not worth the while to have di&s;puted a matter, which time would have finally redre&s;&s;ed, unle&s;s we meant to be in earne&s;t: otherwi&s;e it is like wa&s;ting an e&s;tate on a &s;uit at law, to regulate the tre&s;pa&s;&s;es of a tenant, who&s;e lea&s;e is ju&s;t expiring. No man was a warmer wi&s;her for reconciliation than my&s;elf, before the fatal 19th of April 1755 but the moment the event of that day was made known

We may be as effectually en&s;laved by the want of laws in America, as by &s;ubmitting to laws made for us in England. After matters are made up, (as it is called) can there be any doubt, but the whole power of the crown will be exerted to keep this Continent as low and humble as po&s;&s;ible? In&s;tead of going forward, we &s;hall go backward, or be perpetually quarrelling or ridiculou&s;ly petitioning.&mdash; We are already greater than the King wi&s;hes us to be, and will he not hereafter endeavour to make us le&s;s. To bring the matter to one point, is the power who is jealous of our pro&s;perity, a proper power to govern us? Whoever &s;ays <HI>No</HI> to this que&s;tion is an <HI>Independant,</HI> for independency means no more than whether we &s;hall make our own laws, or, whether the King, the greate&s;t enemy this Continent hath, or can have, &s;hall tell us <Q><HI>there &s;hall be no laws but &s;uch as I like.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="31">But the King you'll &s;ay hath a negative in England; the people there can make no laws without his con&s;ent.

But in this place I decline this &s;ort of reply, tho' I will never cea&s;e to expo&s;e the ab&s;urdity of it, and only an&s;wer, that England being the King's re&s;idence, and America not &s;o, makes quite another ca&s;e. The King's negative here is ten times more dangerous and fatal than it can be in England, for <HI>there</HI> he will &s;carcely refu&s;e his con&s;ent to a bill for putting England into as &s;trong a &s;tate of defence as po&s;&s;ible, and here he would never &s;uffer &s;uch a bill to be pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>America is only a &s;econdary object in the &s;y&s;tem of Briti&s;h politics, England con&s;ults the good of <HI>this</HI> country, no farther than it an&s;wers her <HI>own</HI> purpo&s;e. Wherefore her own intere&s;t leads her to &s;uppre&s;s the growth of <HI>ours</HI> in every ca&s;e which doth not promote <HI>her</HI> advantage, or in the lea&s;t interferes with it. A pretty &s;tate we &s;hould &s;oon be in, under &s;uch a &s;econd-hand government, con&s;idering what has happened! Men do not change from enemies to friends by the alteration of a name: And in order to &s;hew that reconciliation <HI>now</HI> is a dangerous doctrine, I affirm, <HI>that it would be policy in the King at this time, to repeal the acts for the &s;ake of rein&s;tating him&s;elf in the government of the provinces;</HI> in order that HE MAY ACCOMPLISH BY CRAFT AND SUBTILTY, IN THE LONG RUN, WHAT HE CANNOT DO BY FORCE AND VIOLENCE IN THE SHORT ONE. Reconciliation and ruin are nearly related.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI>&mdash;That as even the be&s;t terms which we can expect to obtain, can amount to no more than a temporary expedient, or a kind of government by guardian&s;hip, which can la&s;t no longer than till the Colonies come of age, &s;o the general face and &s;tate of things in the interim will be
<PB N="29" REF="32">un&s;ettled and unpromi&s;ing: Emigrants of property will not choo&s;e to come to a country who&s;e form of government hangs but by a thread, and who is every day tottering on the brink of commotion and di&s;turbance: And numbers of the pre&s;ent inhabitants would lay hold of the interval to di&s;po&s;e of their effects; and quit the continent.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t powerful of all arguments is, that nothing but independance, i. e. a continental form of government, can keep the peace of the continent and pre&s;erve it inviolate from civil wars. I dread the event of a reconciliation with Britain <HI>now,</HI> as it is more than probable, that it will be followed by a revolt &s;ome where or other, the con&s;equences of which may be far more fatal than all the malice of Britain.</P>
<P>Thou&s;ands are already ruined by Briti&s;h barbarity; (thou&s;ands more will probably &s;uffer the &s;ame fate;) Tho&s;e men have other feelings than us who have nothing &s;uffer|ed. All they <HI>now</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s is liberty, what they before enjoyed is &s;acrificed to its &s;ervice and having nothing more to lo&s;e, they di&s;dain &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Be&s;ides, the general tem|per of the colonies towards a Briti&s;h government, will be like that of a youth, who is nearly out of his time; they will care very little about her: And a government which cannot pre&s;erve the peace, is no government at all, and in that ca&s;e we pay our money for nothing; and pray what is it that Britain can do, who&s;e power will be wholly on pa|per, &s;hould a civil tumult break out the very day after reconciliation? I have heard &s;ome men &s;ay, many of whom I believe &s;poke without thinking, that they dreaded an independance, fearing that it would produce civil wars: It is but &s;eldom that our fir&s;t thoughts are truly correct, and that is the ca&s;e here; for there are ten times more to dread from a patched up connection, than from inde|pendance. I make the &s;ufferers ca&s;e my own, and I pro|te&s;t, that were I driven from hou&s;e and home, my property de&s;troyed, and my circum&s;tances ruined, that as a man &s;en|&s;ible of injuries, I could never reli&s;h the doctrine of recon|ciliation, or con&s;ider my&s;elf bound thereby.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="33">The colonies have manife&s;ted &s;uch a &s;pirit of good order and obedience to continental government, as is &s;ufficient to make every rea&s;onable per&s;on ea&s;y and happy on that head.

<P>Where there are no di&s;tinctions, there can be no &s;upe|riority; perfect equality affords no temptation. The republics of Europe are all, (and we may &s;ay always) in peace.

<P>If there is any true cau&s;e for fear re&s;pecting indepen|dance, it is becau&s;e no plan is yet laid down.

Ere &s;he could hear the news, the fatal bufine&s;s might be done; and our&s;elves &s;uffering like the wretched Britons under the op|pre&s;&s;ion of the Conqueror. Ye that oppo&s;e independance now, ye know not what ye do; ye are opening a door to eternal tyranny, by keeping vacant the &s;eat of government. There are thou&s;ands, and tens of thou&s;ands, who would think it glorious to expel from the Continent that barbarous and helli&s;h power, which hath &s;tirred up the Indians and the Negroes to de&s;troy us; the cruelty hath a double guilt, it is dealing brutally by us and treacherou&s;ly by them.</P>
<P>To talk of friend&s;hip with tho&s;e in whom our rea&s;on forbids us to have faith, and our affections wounded thro' a thou&s;and pores in&s;truct us to dete&s;t, is madne&s;s and folly. Every day wears out the little remains of kindred between us and them, and can there be any rea&s;on to hope, that as the relation&s;hip expires, the affection will encrea&s;e, or that we &s;hall agree better, when we have ten times more and greater concerns to quarrel over than ever?</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="37">Ye that tell us of harmony and reconciliation, can ye re&s;tore to us the time that is pa&s;t? Can ye give to pro&s;ti|tution its former innocence? Neither can ye reconcile Britain and America. The la&s;t cord is now broken, the people of England are pre&s;enting addre&s;&s;es again&s;t us. There are injuries which nature cannot forgive; &s;he would cea&s;e to be nature if &s;he did. As well can the lover forgive the ravi&s;her of his mi&s;tre&s;s, as the Continent for|give the murders of Britain. The Almighty hath implant|ed in us the&s;e unextingui&s;hable feelings for good and wi&s;e purpo&s;es. They are the guardians of his image in our hearts. They di&s;tingui&s;h us from the herd of common animals. The &s;ocial compact would di&s;&s;olve, and ju&s;tice be extirpated the earth, or have only a ca&s;ual exi&s;tence, were we callous to the touches of affection. The robber and the murderer would often e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed, did not the injuries which our tempers &s;u&s;tain, provoke us into ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppo&s;e not only the tyranny but the tyrant, &s;tand forth! Every &s;pot of the old world is over-run with oppre&s;&s;ion. Freedom hath been hunted round the globe. A&s;ia and Africa have long ex|pelled her.&mdash;Europe regards her like a &s;tranger, and Eng|land hath given her warning to depart.

<DIV2 TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>Of the PRESENT ABILITY of AMERICA, with &s;ome MISCELLANEOUS REFLECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>I Have never met with a man either in England or America, who hath not confe&s;&s;ed his opinion, that a &s;eparation between the countries would take place, one time or other: And there is no in&s;tance, in which we have &s;hewn le&s;s judgment; than in endeavouring to de&s;cribe what we call the ripene&s;s or fitne&s;s of the Continent for independance.</P>
<P>As all men allow the mea&s;ure, and vary only in their opinion of the time, let us, in order to remove mi&s;takes, take a general &s;urvey of things, and endeavour if po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="35" REF="38">to find out the very time. But I need not go far, the en|quiry cea&s;es at once, for the <HI>time hath found us.</HI> The general concurrence, the glorious union of all things, prove the fact.</P>
<P>'Tis not in the numbers but in unity that our great &s;trength lies: yet our pre&s;ent numbers are &s;ufficient to repel the force of all the world. The Continent hath at this time the large&s;t di&s;ciplined army of any power under Heaven: and is ju&s;t arrived at that pitch of &s;trength, in which no &s;ingle Colony is able to &s;upport it&s;elf, and the whole, when united, is able to do any thing. Our land force is more than &s;ufficient, and as to navy affairs, we cannot be in&s;en&s;ible that Btitain would never &s;uffer an American man of war to be built, while the Continent re|mained in her hands. Wherefore, we &s;hould be no for|warder an hundred years hence, in that branch than we are now; but the truth is, we &s;hould be le&s;s &s;o, becau&s;e the timber of the country is every day dimini&s;hing.</P>
<P>Were the Continent crowded with inhabitants, her &s;ufferings under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances would be intole|rable. The more &s;ea-port towns we had, the more &s;hould we have both to defend and to lo&s;e. Our pre&s;ent numbers are &s;o happily proportioned to our wants, that no man need be idle. The diminution of trade affords an army, and the nece&s;&s;ities of an army create a new trade.</P>
<P>Debts we have none: and whatever we may contract on this account will &s;erve as a glorious memento of our virtue. Can we but leave po&s;terity with a &s;ettled form of govern|ment, an independant con&s;titution of its own, the purcha&s;e at any price will be cheap. But to expend millions for the &s;ake of getting a few vile acts repealed, and routing the pre&s;ent mini&s;try only, is unworthy of the charge, and is u&s;ing po&s;terity with the utmo&s;t cruelty; becau&s;e it is leaving them the great work to do, and a debt upon their backs from which they derive no advantage. Such a thought is unworthy a man of honour, and is the true characteri&s;tic of a narrow heart and a pidling politician.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="39">The debt we may contract doth not de&s;erve our regard if the work be but accompli&s;hed. No nation ought to be without a debt. A national debt is a national bond; and when it bears no intere&s;t, is in no ca&s;e a grievance. Britain is oppre&s;&s;ed with a debt of upwards of one hundred and forty millions &s;terling, for which &s;he pays upwards of four millions intere&s;t. And as a compen&s;ation for her debt; &s;he has a large navy: America is without a debt, and without a navy; but for the twentieth part of the Engli&s;h national debt, could have a navy as large again. The navy of England is not worth at this time more than three millions and an half &s;terling.</P>
<P>No country on the globe is &s;o happily &s;ituated, or &s;o internally capable of rai&s;ing a fleet as America. Tar, tim|ber, iron, and cordage are her natural produce. We need go abroad for nothing. Whereas the Dutch, who make large profits by hiring out their &s;hips of war to the Spa|niards and Portugue&s;e, are obliged to import mo&s;t of the materials they u&s;e. We ought to view the building a fleet as an article of commerce, it being the natural manufactory of this country. 'Tis the be&s;t money we can lay out. A navy when fini&s;hed is worth more than it co&s;t: And is that nice point in national policy, in which commerce and pro|tection are united. Let us build; if we want them not, we can &s;ell, and by that means re-place our paper currency with ready gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>In point of manning a fleet, people in general run into great errors; it is not nece&s;&s;ary that one fourth part &s;hould be &s;ailors. The Terrible privateer, Capt. Death, &s;tood the hotte&s;t engagement of any &s;hip la&s;t war, yet had not twenty &s;ailors on board, though her complement of men was upwards of two hundred. A few able and &s;ocial &s;ailors will &s;oon in&s;truct a &s;ufficient number of active landmen in the common work of a &s;hip. Wherefore we never can be more capable to begin on maritime matters than now, while our timber is &s;tanding, our &s;i&s;heries blocked up, and our &s;ailors and &s;hipwrights out of employ. Men of war
<PB N="37" REF="40">of &s;eventy and eighty guns were built forty years ago in New England, and why not the &s;ame now? Ship building is America's greate&s;t pride, and in which, &s;he will in time excel the whole world. The great empires of the Ea&s;t are mo&s;tly inland and con&s;equently excluded from the po&s;&s;ibility of rivalling her. Africa is in a &s;tate of Barbari&s;m; and no power in Europe, hath either &s;uch an extent of coa&s;t, or &s;uch an internal &s;upply of materials. Where nature hath given the one &s;he has with-held the other; to America only hath &s;he been liberal of both. The va&s;t empire of Ru&s;&s;ia is almo&s;t &s;hut out from the &s;ea; wherefore, her boundle&s;s forre&s;ts, her tar, iron, and cordage are only articles of commerce.</P>
<P>In point of &s;afety, ought we to be without a fleet? We are not the little people now, which we were &s;ixty years ago, at that time we might have tru&s;ted our property in the &s;treets, or fields rather, and &s;lept &s;ecurely without locks or bolts to our doors and windows. The ca&s;e now is altered, and our methods of defence, ought to improve with our increa&s;e of property. A common pirate twelve months ago might have come up the Delaware, and laid the city of Phi|ladelphia under in&s;tant-contribution for what &s;um he plea&s;ed; and the &s;ame might have happened to other places. Nay, any daring fellow in a brig of 14 or 16 guns might have robbed the whole continent, and carried off half a million of money. The&s;e are circum&s;tances which demand our attention and point our the nece&s;&s;ity of naval protection.</P>
<P>Some perhaps will &s;ay, that after we have made it up with Britain that &s;he will protect us. Can we be &s;o unwi&s;e as to mean that &s;he &s;hall keep a navy in our harbours for that purpo&s;e? Common &s;en&s;e will tell us, that the power which hath endeavoured to &s;ubdue us, is of all others, the mo&s;t improper to defend us. Conque&s;t may be effected un|der the pretence of friend&s;hip; and our&s;elves after a long and brave re&s;i&s;tance, be at la&s;t cheated into &s;lavery. And if her &s;hips are not to be admitted into our harbours, I would
<PB N="38" REF="41">a&s;k, how is &s;he to protect us? A navy three or four thou|&s;and miles off can be of little u&s;e, and on &s;udden emergencies, none at all. Wherefore if we mu&s;t hereafter protect our|&s;elves, why not do it for our&s;elves? why do it for another?</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h li&s;t of &s;hips of war, is long and formidable, but not a tenth part of them are at any one time fit for &s;ervice, numbers of them not in being; yet their names are pom|pou&s;ly continued in the li&s;t if only a plank is left of the &s;hip: and not a fifth part of &s;uch as are fit for &s;ervice, can be &s;pared on any one &s;tation at one time. The Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, Mediterranean, Africa, and other parts over which Britain extends her claim, make large demands upon her navy. From a mixture of prejudice and inattention, we have con|tracted a fal&s;e notion re&s;pecting the navy of England, and have talked as if we &s;hould have the whole of it to encounter at once, and for that rea&s;on, &s;uppo&s;ed, that we mu&s;t have one as large; which not being in&s;tantly practicable, hath been made u&s;e of by a &s;et of di&s;gui&s;ed tories to di&s;courage our beginning thereon. Nothing can be farther from truth than this, for if America had only a twentieth part of the naval force of Britain, &s;he would be by far an over match for her; becau&s;e as we neither have, nor claim any foreign dominion, our whole force would be employed on our own coa&s;t, where we &s;hould, in the long run, have two to one the advantage of tho&s;e who had three or four thou&s;and miles to &s;ail over, before they could attack us, and the &s;ame di&s;|tance to return in order to refit and recruit. And although Britain by her fleet hath a check over our trade to Europe, we have as large a one over her trade to the We&s;t Indies, which by laying in the neighbourhood of the Continent lies entirely at its mercy.</P>
<P>Some method might be fallen on to keep up a naval force in time of peace, if we &s;hould not judge it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;up|port a con&s;tant navy. If premiums were to be given to merchants to build and employ in their &s;ervice, &s;hips mount|ed with 20, 30, 40 or 50 guns (the premiums to be in pro|portion
<PB N="39" REF="42">to the lo&s;s of bulk to the merchant) fifty or &s;ixty of tho&s;e &s;hips, with a few guard &s;hips on con&s;tant duty would keep up a &s;ufficient navy, and that without burdening our|&s;elves with the evil &s;o loudly complained of in England, of &s;uffering their fleets in time of peace to lie rotting in the docks. To unite the &s;inews of commerce and defence is &s;ound policy; for when our &s;trength and our riches play into each other's hand we need fear no external enemy.</P>
<P>In almo&s;t every article of defence we abound. Hemp flouri&s;hes even to rankne&s;s, &s;o that we need not want cor|dage. Our iron is &s;uperior to that of other countries. Our &s;mall arms equal to any in the world. Cannon we can ca&s;t at plea&s;ure. Salt-petre and gun-powder we are every day producing. Our knowledge is hourly improving. Re&s;o|lution is our inherent character, and courage hath never yet for&s;aken us. Wherefore what is it that we want? Why is it that we he&s;itate? From Britain we can expect nothing but ruin. If &s;he is once admitted to the government of America again, this Continent will not be worth living in. Jealou&s;ies will be always ari&s;ing; in&s;urrections will be con|&s;tantly happening; and who will go forth to quell them? who will venture his life to reduce his own countrymen to a foreign obedience; the difference between Penn&s;ylvania and Connecticut, re&s;pecting &s;ome unlocated lands, &s;hews the in&s;ignificance of a Briti&s;h government, and fully proves, that nothing but Continental authority cna regulate Continental matters.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on why the pre&s;ent time is preferable to all others, is, that the fewer our numbers are, the more land there is yet unoccupied, which in&s;tead of being lavi&s;hed by the king on his worthle&s;s dependants, may be hereafter applied, not only to the di&s;charge of the pre&s;ent debt, but to the con&s;tant &s;upport of government. No nation under Heaven hath &s;uch an advantage as this.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="43">The infant &s;tate of the Colonies, as it is called, &s;o far from being again&s;t is an argument in favour of independance. We are &s;ufficiently numerous, and were we more &s;o we might be le&s;s united. 'Tis a matter worthy of ob&s;ervation, that the more a country is peopled, the &s;maller their armies are. In military numbers the ancients far exceeded the moderns: and the rea&s;on is evident, for trade being the con&s;equence of population, men become too much ab&s;orbed thereby to attend to any thing el&s;e. Commerce dimini&s;hes the &s;pirit both of Patrioti&s;m and of military defence. And hi&s;tory &s;ufficiently informs us that the brave&s;t atchievements were always accompli&s;hed in the non-age of a nation. With the encrea&s;e of commerce England hath lo&s;t its &s;pirit. The more men have to lo&s;e, the le&s;s willing are they to venture. The rich are in general &s;laves to fear, and &s;ubmit to courtly power with the trembling duplicity of a &s;paniel.</P>
<P>Youth is the &s;eed time of good habits as well in nations as in individuals. It might be difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible to form the Continent into one Government half a century hence. The va&s;t variety of intere&s;ts occa&s;ioned by an in|crea&s;e of trade and population, would create confu&s;ion. Colony would be again&s;t Colony. Each being able would &s;corn each others a&s;&s;i&s;tance: and while the proud and fooli&s;h gloried in their little di&s;tinctions, the wi&s;e would lament that the union had not been formed before. Wherefore, the pre&s;ent time is the true time for e&s;tabli&s;hing it. The intimacy which is contracted in infancy, and the friend&s;hip which is formed in misfortune, are of all others, the mo&s;t la&s;ting and unalterable. Our pre&s;ent union is marked with both the&s;e characters: we are young, and we have been di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; but our concord hath with&s;tood our troubles, and fixes a memorable Aera for po&s;terity to glory in.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent time likewi&s;e, is that peculiar time, which never happens to a nation but once, viz. the time of forming it&s;elf into a government. Mo&s;t nations have let
<PB N="41" REF="44">&s;lip the opportunity, and by that means have been com|pelled to receive laws from their conquerors, in&s;tead of making laws for them&s;elves. Fir&s;t they had a king, and then a form of government; whereas the articles or charter of government &s;hould be formed fir&s;t, and men delegated to execute them afterward; but from the errors of other nations let us learn wi&s;dom, and lay hold of the pre&s;ent opportunity&mdash;<HI>To begin Government at the right end.</HI></P>
<P>When William the Conqueror &s;ubdued England, he gave them law at the point of the &s;word; and until we con&s;ent that the &s;eat of government in America be legally and authoritatively filled, we &s;hall be in danger of having it filled by &s;ome fortunate ruffian, who may treat us in the &s;ame manner, and then, where will be our freedom? where our property?</P>
<P>As to religion, I hold it to be the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of government to protect all con&s;cientious profe&s;&s;ors there|of, and I know of no other bu&s;ine&s;s which government hath to do therewith: let a man throw a&s;ide that narrow|ne&s;s of &s;oul, that &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of principle, which the niggards of all profe&s;&s;ions are &s;o unwilling to part with, and he will be delivered from his fears on that head. Su&s;picion is the companion of mean &s;ouls and the bane of all good &s;ociety. For my &s;elf, I fully and con&s;cientiou&s;ly believe, that it is the will of the Almighty, that there &s;hould be diver&s;ity of re|ligious opinions among us. It affords a large field for our chri&s;tian kindne&s;s; were we all of one way of think|ing, our religious di&s;po&s;itions would want matter for pro|bation: and on this liberal principle I look on the various denominations among us, to be like children of the &s;ame family, differing only in what is called their chri&s;tian names.</P>
<P>In page 30 and 31 I threw out a few thoughts on the propriety of a continental charter, (for I only pre&s;ume to offer hints, not plans,) and in this place I take the liberty of re-mentioning the &s;ubject, by ob&s;erving, that a charter is to be under&s;tood as a bond of &s;olemn obligation, which
<PB N="42" REF="45">the whole enters into, to &s;upport the right of every &s;eparate part, whether of religion, per&s;onal freedom, or property. A right reckoning makes long friends.</P>
<P>In a former page I likewi&s;e mentioned the nece&s;&s;ity of a large and equal repre&s;entation; and there is no political matter which more de&s;erves our attention. A &s;mall number of electors, or a &s;mall number of repre&s;entatives are equally dangerous. But if the number of the repre&s;entatives be not only &s;mall, but unequal, the danger is encrea&s;ed. As an in&s;tance of this I mention the following; when the a&s;&s;o|ciators petition was before the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly of Penn|&s;ylvania, twenty eight members only were pre&s;ent. All the Bucks county members, being eight, voted again&s;t it, and had &s;even of the Che&s;ter members done the &s;ame, this whole Province had been governed by two counties only, and this danger it is always expo&s;ed to. The unwarrantable &s;tretch likewi&s;e, which that hou&s;e made in their la&s;t &s;itting, to gain an undue authority over the Delegates of that Province, ought to warn the people at large, how they tru&s;t power out of their own hands. A &s;et of in&s;tructions for the De|legates were put together, which in point of &s;en&s;e and bu&s;i|ne&s;s would have di&s;honour'd a &s;chool-boy, and after being approved by a <HI>few,</HI> a <HI>very few</HI> without doors, were carried into the hou&s;e, and there pa&s;&s;ed <HI>in behalf of the whole Colony:</HI> whereas did the whole Colony know, with what ill-will that hou&s;e had entered on &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary public mea&s;ures, they would not he&s;itate a moment to think them unworthy of &s;uch a tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Immediate nece&s;&s;ity makes many things convenient, which if continued would grow into oppre&s;&s;ions. Expedi|ence and right, are different things. When the calamities of America require a con&s;ultation, there was no method &s;o ready, or at that time &s;o proper, as to appoint per&s;ons from the &s;everal hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly for that purpo&s;e; and the wi&s;dom with which they have proceeded hath pre&s;erved this Continent from ruin. But as it is more than probable
<PB N="43" REF="46">that we &s;hall never be without a CONGRESS, every well wi&s;her to good order, mu&s;t own, that the mode for choo&s;ing members of that body, de&s;erves con&s;ideration. And I put it as a que&s;tion to tho&s;e, who make a &s;tudy of mankind, whether repre&s;entation and election is not too great a power for one and the &s;ame body of men to po&s;&s;e&s;s? When we are planning for po&s;terity, we ought to remember, that virtue is not hereditary.</P>
<P>It is from our enemies that we often gain excellent maxims, and are frequently &s;urpri&s;ed into rea&s;on by their mi&s;takes. Mr. Cornwall (one of the Lords of the Trea&s;ury) treated the petition of the New-York A&s;&s;embly with contempt, becau&s;e that hou&s;e, he &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ted but of twenty &s;ix members, which trifling number, he argued, could not with decency be put for the whole. We thank him for his involuntary hone&s;ty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e who would fully under&s;tand of what great con&s;equence a large and equal repre&s;entation is to a State, &s;hould read Burgh's political Di&s;qui&s;itions.</NOTE></P>
<P>TO CONCLUDE, however &s;trange it may appear to &s;ome, or however unwilling they may be to think &s;o, matters not, but many &s;trong and &s;triking rea&s;ons may be given to &s;hew, that nothing can &s;ettle our affairs &s;o expe|ditiou&s;ly as an open and determined declaration for inde|pendance. Some of which are,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI>&mdash;It is the cu&s;tom of Nations, when any two are at war, for &s;ome other powers not engaged in the quarrel, to &s;tep in as Mediators and bring about the Preliminaries of a Peace: but while America calls her&s;elf the Subject of Great Britain, no power, however well di&s;po&s;ed &s;he may be, can offer her Mediation. Wherefore in our pre&s;ent &s;tate we may quarrel on for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI>&mdash;It is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that France or Spain will give us any kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if we mean only to make u&s;e of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for the purpo&s;e of repairing the
<PB N="44" REF="47">breach, and &s;trengthning the connection between Britain and America; becau&s;e, tho&s;e powers would be &s;ufferers by the con&s;equences.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI>&mdash;While we profe&s;s our&s;elves the Subjects of Britain, we mu&s;t in the eye of foreign nations be con&s;i|dered as Rebels. The precedent is &s;omewhat dangerous to <HI>their peace,</HI> for men to be in arms under the name of Subjects: we on the &s;pot can &s;olve the paradox; but to unite re&s;i&s;tance and &s;ubjection, requires an idea much too refined for common under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI>&mdash;Were a manife&s;to to be publi&s;hed and di&s;patch|ed to foreign Courts, &s;etting forth the mi&s;eries we have en|dured, and the peaceable methods we have ineffectually u&s;ed for redre&s;s, declaring at the &s;ame time, that not being able any longer to live happily or &s;afely, under the cruel di&s;po|&s;ition of the Briti&s;h Court, we had been driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of breaking off all connections with her: at the &s;ame time, a&s;&s;uring all &s;uch Courts of our peaceable di&s;po|&s;ition towards them, and of our de&s;ire of entering into trade with them: &s;uch a memorial would produce more good effects to this Continent, than if a &s;hip were freighted with petitions to Britain.</P>
<P>Under our pre&s;ent denomination of Briti&s;h Subjects, we can neither be received nor heard abroad; the cu&s;tom of all Courts is again&s;t us, and will be &s;o, until by an Inde|pendance we take rank with other Nations.</P>
<P>The&s;e proceedings may at fir&s;t appear &s;trange and difficult, but, like all other &s;teps which we have already pa&s;&s;ed over, will in a little time become familiar and agreeable: and until an Independance is declared, the Continent will feel it&s;elf like a man who continues putting off &s;ome unplea&s;ant bu&s;ine&s;s from day to day, yet knows it mu&s;t be done, hates to &s;et about it, wi&s;hes it over, and is continually haunted with the thoughts of its nece&s;&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>AMERICAN INDEPENDANCY <HI>defended.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN the little pamphlet intitled COMMON SENSE fir&s;t made its appearance in favor of that &s;o often abjured idea of independance upon upon Great-Britain, I was informed that no le&s;s than three gentlemen of re&s;pectable abilities were engaged to an&s;wer it. As yet I have &s;een nothing which di|rectly pretends to di&s;pute a &s;ingle po&s;ition of the au|thor. The oblique e&s;&s;ay in Humphreys's paper, and &s;olemn Te&s;timony of the Quakers, however intended, having offered nothing to the purpo&s;e, I &s;hall take leave to examine this important que&s;tion, with all candor and attention, and &s;ubmit the re&s;ult to my much intere&s;ted country.</P>
<P>Dependance of one man, or &s;tate, upon another, is either ab&s;olute, or limited by &s;ome certain terms of agreement. The dependance of the&s;e colonies which Great-Britain calls <HI>con&s;titutional,</HI> as declared by act of parliament, is ab&s;olute. If the contrary of this be the bugbear &s;o many have been declaiming again&s;t, I could wi&s;h my countrymen would con&s;ider the con&s;equences of &s;o &s;tupid a profe&s;&s;ion. If a limited dependance is intended. I would be much obliged to any one who will &s;hew me the <HI>Britanno American Magna Charta</HI> wherein the terms of our limited dependance are preci&s;ely &s;tated. If no &s;uch thing can be found, and <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> dependance be accounted inadmi&s;&s;ible, the &s;ound we are &s;quabbling about has certainly no determinate meaning. If any &s;ay we mean that kind of dependance we acknowledged at and before the year 1763; I an&s;wer, <HI>vague and uncertain laws, and more e&s;pecially</HI> CONSTITUTIONS, are the very in&s;truments of &s;lavery. The Magna Charta of England was very explicit, con&s;idering the time it was formed, and yet much blood was &s;pilt in di&s;putes concerning its meaning.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="51">Be&s;ides the danger of an indefinite dependance upon an undetermined power, it might be worth while to con&s;ider what the characters are on whom we are &s;o ready to acknowledge our&s;elves dependant. The votaries for this idol tell us, upon the good people of our Mother Country, whom they repre&s;ent as the mo&s;t ju&s;t, humane, and affectio|nate friends we can have in the world. Were this true, it were &s;ome encouragement; but who can pretend ignorance that the&s;e ju&s;t and humane friends are as much under the tyranny of men of a rever&s;e character as we &s;hould be, could tho&s;e mi&s;creants gain their ends? I di&s;|claim any more than a mutual dependance on any man, or number of men upon earth; but an indefinite de|pendance upon a combination of men, who have, in the face of the &s;un, broken thro' the mo&s;t &s;olemn cove|nants, debauched the hereditary, and corrupted the elective guardians of the people's rights, who have, in fact, e&s;tabli&s;hed an ab&s;olute tyranny in Great-Britain and Ireland, and openly declared them&s;elves <HI>competent to bind the Coloni&s;ts in all ca&s;es what&s;oever:</HI> I &s;ay indefinite de|pendance on &s;uch a combination of <HI>u&s;urping innovators</HI> is evidently as dangerous to liberty, as fatal to civil and &s;ocial happine&s;s, as any one &s;tep that could be propo&s;ed, even by the <HI>de&s;troyer of men.</HI> The utmo&s;t that the hone&s;t party in Great-Britain can do, is to warn us to avoid this dependance at all hazards? Does not even a Duke of Grafion declare the mini&s;terial mea&s;ures illegal and dangerous? And &s;hall America, no way connected with this admini&s;tration, pre&s;s our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch mea&s;ures, and reconciliation to the authors of them? Would not &s;uch pigeon-hearted wretches equally forward the recal of the Stuart family, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Popery throughout Chri&s;tendom, did they conceive the party in favor of tho&s;e loyal mea&s;ures the &s;tronge&s;t? Shame on the men who can court exemption from pre&s;ent trouble and expence, at the price of their own and po&s;terity's liberty! The
<PB N="49" REF="52">hone&s;t party in England cannot wi&s;h for the reconciliation propo&s;ed. It is as un&s;afe to them as to us, and they thoroughly apprehend it. What check have they now upon the crown, and what &s;hadow of control can they pre|tend, when the crown can command fifteen or twenty millions a year, which they have nothing to &s;ay to? A proper proportion of our commerce is all that can benefit any good man in Britain or Ireland, and God forbid we &s;hould be &s;o cruel as to furni&s;h bad men with power to en|&s;lave both Britain and America. Admini&s;tration has now fairly di&s;&s;evered the dangerous tie: Execrated will he be by the late&s;t po&s;terity who again joins the fatal cord! But &s;ay the puling pu&s;illanimous cowards, we &s;hall be &s;ubject to a long and bloody war, if we declare independance. On the contrary, I affirm it the only &s;tep that can bring the conte&s;t to a &s;peedy and happy i&s;&s;ue. By declaring inde|pendance we place our&s;elves on a footing for an equal nego|ciation: Now we are called a pack of villainous rebels, who, like the St. Vincent Indians, can expect nothing more than a pardon for our lives, and the &s;overeign favor, re|&s;pecting freedom and property, <HI>to be at the King's will.</HI> Grant Almighty God that I may be numbered with the dead before that &s;able day dawn on North-America!</P>
<P>All Europe knows the illegal and inhuman treatment we have received from Britons. All Europe wi&s;hes the haughty empre&s;s of the main reduced to a more humble deportment. After her&s;elf has thru&s;t her Colonies from her, the maritime powers cannot be &s;uch idiots as to &s;uffer her to reduce them to a more ab&s;olute obedience of her dictates than they were heretofore obliged to yield. Does not the mo&s;t &s;uperficial politician know, that while we profe&s;s our&s;elves the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, and yet hold arms again&s;t her, they have a right to treat us as rebels, and that according to the laws of nature and na|tions no other &s;tate has a right to interfere in the di&s;pute? But on the other hand, on our declaration of independance, the maritime &s;tates at lea&s;t will find it their intere&s;t, which
<PB N="50" REF="53">always &s;ecures the que&s;tion of inclination, to protect a people who can be &s;o advantageous to them. So that tho&s;e &s;hort-&s;ighted politicians, who conclude that this &s;tep will involve us in &s;laughter and deva&s;tation, may plainly perceive that no mea&s;ure in our power will &s;o naturally and effectually work our deliverance. The motion of a finger of the Grand Monarch would procure as gentle a temper in the omnipotent Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter, as appeared in the Manilla ran&s;om and Falkland i&s;lands affairs. From without certainly we have every thing to hope, nothing to fear; from within, &s;ome tell us the Pre&s;byterians, if freed from the re&s;training power of Great-Britain, would over-run the peaceable Quakers in this government. For my own part. I de&s;pi&s;e the bickerings of &s;ectaries, and am apprehen&s;ive of no trouble from that quarter, e&s;pecially while no peculiar honors nor emoluments are annexed to either. I heartily wi&s;h too many of the Quakers did not give cau&s;e of complaint, by endeavoring to counteract the mea&s;ures of their fellow citizens for the common &s;afety. If they profe&s;s them&s;elves only pilgrims here, let them walk through the men of this world without interfering with their actions on either &s;ide. If they would not <HI>pull down Kings,</HI> let them not <HI>&s;upport tyrants;</HI> for whether they under&s;tand it or not, there is, and ever has been, an e&s;&s;ential difference in the characters.</P>
<P>Finally, with M. De Vatell, I account <HI>a &s;tate a moral per&s;on, having an intere&s;t and will of its own,</HI> and I think that &s;tate a mon&s;ter, who&s;e prime mover has an intere&s;t and will, in direct oppo&s;ition to its pro&s;perity and &s;ecurity. This po&s;ition has been &s;o clearly demon&s;trated in the pam|phlet fir&s;t mentioned in this e&s;&s;ay, that I &s;hall only add, if there are any arguments in favor of returning to a &s;tate of dependance on Great-Britain, that is, on the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration of Great-Britain, I could wi&s;h they were timely offered, that they may be &s;oberly con&s;idered, before the cunning propo&s;als of the cabinet &s;et all the timid, lazy and irre&s;olute members of the community into a clamor for <HI>peace at any rate.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Propriety of <HI>INDEPENDANCY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TO acknowledge that the Creator formed Man for &s;ociety, and that &s;ociety cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without regulations, laws, and government; and at the &s;ame time to a&s;&s;ert, that in &s;pight of all human care to prevent it, every government will degene|rate into a tyranny, is &s;uch a daring <HI>bla&s;phemy</HI> of the <HI>divine attri|butes,</HI> that had I not heard it a&s;&s;erted, and acquie&s;ced in as a truth. I could not have believed &s;uch a po&s;ition could have ob|tained in a civilized country! This mon&s;trous hypothe&s;is con|cludes that notwith&s;tanding the Deity had power enough to form &s;uch admirable creatures as men and women, and fit them for enjoying of each other a thou&s;and ways, and tho' by means of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite of tho&s;e enjoyments a race &s;hould ari&s;e from them over which every power of rightful government mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be exerci&s;ed, yet ju&s;t and rightful government is in reality utopian, imaginary, and impracticable! Did not God cloath the gra&s;s, direct the wild Goat, and provide for the Spar|row, I might more ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded to &s;u&s;pect his care of Man.</P>
<P>I readily grant that the delegates of governmental power are too apt to con&s;ider them&s;elves the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it <HI>in their own right,</HI> and that they therefore take every means in their power to be|come the <HI>ma&s;ters</HI> in the place of <HI>&s;ervanis</HI> to their <HI>con&s;tituents;</HI> and that the people in all civilized countries have been too inatten|tive to the u&s;urpations of their rulers: But I conceive of no cau&s;e in the nature of things which &s;o ab&s;olutely counteracts the power of a wi&s;e, learned, and free community as to render it im|po&s;&s;ible for them to pre&s;erve their liberty. The arguments bro't from the condition of other &s;tates, are by no means conclu&s;ive with re&s;pect to the North American colonies. I am bold to a&s;|&s;ert, that &s;uch a favorable combination of circum&s;tances as they are ble&s;&s;ed with at this important conjuncture, never did take place among any people with whom hi&s;tory has made us ac|quainted. The mo&s;t ju&s;t and &s;olid foundation of &s;ocial happi|ne&s;s was laid in the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the Continent, <HI>the cultiva|tion of the earth for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of its proprietor.</HI> Here was no feudal tenure from &s;ome military Lord; every cultivator being the lord of his own &s;oil, and content with its produce, had no thoughts of encroaching upon and &s;ubjecting his neighbour to his ab&s;olute dominion. Hence' a hand&s;ome competency has enabled the bulk of the people to give their children &s;uch an edu|cation as enables them to read, and become acquainted with the u&s;urpations of the deepe&s;t plotters of their ruin. The &s;pirit of
<PB N="52" REF="55">the people for obtaining this nece&s;&s;ary information, is evident from the incredible number of news-papers and other periodical publications which they encourage, and the effect of &s;uch in&s;ti|tutions never have been &s;o great in any community, yet known, as in the&s;e <HI>pantaplebean (altogether</HI> Commons) colonies. How quickly the mo&s;t important revolution of the fundamentals of our policy can pervade a continent, may be gue&s;&s;ed at by the progre&s;s of the idea of Colonial Independency in three weeks or a month at farthe&s;t! Surely thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands of com|mon farmers and trade&s;men mu&s;t be better rea&s;oners than &s;ome of our trammelled <HI>juris con&s;ultors,</HI> who to this hour feel a reluc|tance to part with the abominable chain, which remaining, in any &s;hape whatever, tho' modified by all the wi&s;dom and caution of the greate&s;t men now living, mu&s;t in a very little time drag the colonies into the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery. Many profe&s;s them|&s;elves zealous for the liberties of America, yet declare an abhor|rence of the idea of independancy on Great-Britain. If this be not a &s;oleci&s;m, as ab&s;urd and irreconcileable as ever was obtruded on mankind, I know not the meaning of the term! <HI>Civil Liberty</HI> never was defined in &s;tricter terms than <HI>an</HI> EXEMPTION <HI>from all controul,</HI> WITHOUT THE COMMUNITY, <HI>in which every qualified member has an equal voice.</HI> No American, as &s;uch, has the &s;hadow of incorporation with the government of Great-Britain; and in con&s;equence, if he receives the lea&s;t &s;yllable of law from that quarter, he gives up his claim to the definitive exemption. If the &s;ticklers for <HI>dependance</HI> do not mean dependance for &s;ome certain laws, in the forming of which the Coloni&s;ts have no voice at all, I do not yet under&s;tand them; and if they do mean that we &s;hould admit the <HI>claim</HI> of any &s;tate, or any part of the power of any &s;tate, with which the domocratic power of this &s;tate is not incorporated, to give us law <HI>in any ca&s;e whatever,</HI> they admit a <HI>fibre,</HI> which I mu&s;t make free to tell them, will &s;peedily grow into an <HI>iron &s;inew</HI> which neither them&s;elves nor po&s;terity will be able to endure or bur&s;t a&s;under. And further, it is not only the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome po&s;&s;ible law from a foreign power, that hurries a people into &s;lavery; a meer negative power on acts for the repeal of grievous laws will more &s;lowly, but as certainly &s;ubvert liberty,</P>
<P>Again, Mr. Hume's ob&s;ervation, [<HI>Perfect Common-wealth,</HI> p. 301.] that "the &s;word being in the hands of a &s;ingle per&s;on who will <HI>always neglect to di&s;cipline the militia,</HI> in order to have the pre|text to <HI>keep: up a &s;tanding army;</HI>" and the &s;ucceeding one, "that
<PB N="53" REF="56">this is a <HI>mortal di&s;temper</HI> in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> government of which it <HI>mu&s;t, at la&s;t inevitably peri&s;h,</HI>" now &s;o fatally confirmed, may be a &s;ufficient warning to the Colonies to <HI>beware of being again entangled with the yoke of bondage.</HI></P>
<P>Many object to a Republican Government as impracticable in a large &s;tate. "The contrary of this [&s;ays Hume, <HI>Per. Com.</HI> 302.] &s;eems evident. Tho' 'tis more difficult to form a Repub|lican Government in an exten&s;ive country than in a city; there is more facility, when once it is formed, of pre&s;erving it &s;teady and uniform, without tumult or faction, in the former than the latter. (<HI>Per. Com.</HI> 303.) In a large government which is mo|delled with ma&s;terly &s;kill, there is compa&s;s and room enough to refine the democracy from the lower people, who may be ad|mitted into the fir&s;t elections, or fir&s;t concoction of the common|wealth, to the higher magi&s;trates who direct all the motions. At the &s;ame time the parts are &s;o di&s;tant and remote that 'tis very difficult either by intrigue, prejudice, or pa&s;&s;ion, to hurry them into mea&s;ures again&s;t the public intere&s;t." Thus far Mr. Hume, who&s;e plan for a perfect commonwealth, will &s;peedily be &s;ubmitted to public con&s;ideration.</P>

<HEAD>A Review of the American Conte&s;t, with &s;ome Strictures on the King's Speech, and its con&s;equences. Addre&s;&s;ed to all Parents, in the Thirteen United Colonies. By a Friend to Po&s;terity and Mankind.</HEAD>
<P>NATURE in&s;tructs the brute creation to provide for, guard and protect their offspring until they are able to do for them&s;elves. The dam is never known to for&s;ake her young while her care is nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;afety, nor to do any thing which would involve them in di&s;tre&s;s and difficulty. Man, who has this principle in common with brutes, is endowed with others yet more valuable, but which to him are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, whereby he is taught to provide for the future welfare of his de&s;cendants and to guard them from the encroachments of that power which civil &s;ociety con&s;titutes for its own &s;afety; but which, through the depravity of human nature is often turned again&s;t it. There are few parents who do not make it their
<PB N="54" REF="57">con&s;tant &s;tudy and earne&s;t endeavour to leave &s;ome valuable in|heritance to their children: few who have been &s;o lo&s;t to the feelings of nature and calls of parental affection, as to entail difficuly and di&s;tre&s;s on their children, when it was in their power to leave them a fair and ea&s;y inheritance. And yet it has &s;o happened, that by an ill timed attachment to the pre&s;ent, without paying proper attention to the future, they have entailed mi&s;ery upon them by the very means which were de&s;igned to pre&s;erve them from it.</P>
<P>It is now in your power to bequeath to your children the one or the other, and it becomes you to have an eye to them in all your proceedings. It is &s;ufficiently known to you, that riches in arbitrary &s;tates are often the ruin of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and that &s;ecurity to property is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tamp their true value on wealth and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, He therefore, who wi&s;hes to leave his children in flouri&s;hing circum&s;tances ought to be a zealous friend to tho&s;e mea&s;ures, and that plan of government which gives the greate&s;t &s;ecurity to property, and an active warm op|po&s;er of tho&s;e which leave it to the arbitrary di&s;po&s;al of men, who find a greater advantage in making free with what does not belong to them, than in frugally u&s;ing what is ju&s;tly their own. Whig and Tory &s;hould be out of the que&s;tion. Private pique, party faction and animo&s;ity ought to &s;ub&s;ide. He who thinks &s;hould think for po&s;terity, and he who acts &s;hould act for his children.</P>
<P>It is a great weakne&s;s to &s;uffer our pa&s;&s;ions to take place of our &s;ea&s;on and blindly to follow their dictates, though to our manife&s;t hurt, rather than &s;ubject them to our better &s;en&s;e. A fal&s;e pride, which will not acknowledge an error though ever &s;o evident, an ob&s;tinate per&s;everance in our own opinion without deigning to hear advice or in&s;truction, and an unrea&s;onable at|rachment to party, have done much mi&s;chief to mankind, and may yet do more if not carefully avoided. I have directed this paper to you in preference to others, becau&s;e your parental affec|tion &s;hould form more than a counter poi&s;e to every fal&s;e principle, which can influence the human mind where the intere&s;t of your offspring is at &s;take.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent conte&s;t is immen&s;ely great, and every man mu&s;t &s;ee that it will affect po&s;terity. Its con&s;equences cannot end with it&s;elf; but the late&s;t generations mu&s;t &s;eel its effects. The great Ruler of the univer&s;e has permitted it for wi&s;e purpo&s;es, and has called every one of us to act our part in it. It becomes
<PB N="55" REF="58">us, therefore, laying a&s;ide all former prejudices, partiality and party attachments, to act upon principles which will ju&s;tify us to him who has a&s;&s;igned us our &s;tations, and cau&s;e po&s;terity to ble&s;s the memory of their forefathers. We all agree in this, that Great-Britain is unju&s;t and arbitrary, and we have hitherto principally differed in the mode of oppo&s;ition, which ought to have been pur&s;ued. I &s;peak not to tho&s;e who think one way and talk another. They act upon &s;uch ba&s;e principles, that it is in vain to attempt to rouze in them any ju&s;t or generous &s;enti|ments. We have no in&s;tances of the conver&s;ion of avaricious or ambitious hypocrites, and it would be wa&s;ting time to u&s;e arguments to convince them. I direct my&s;elf to you who have &s;incerity &s;ufficient to examine the principles on which you proceed, and hone&s;ty enough to pur&s;ue that cour&s;e of conduct which appears to be right, and &s;o much affection for your children as to prefer their intere&s;t and happine&s;s to every other con&s;ideration. For you I mean to throw together a few hints which may a&s;&s;i&s;t you in finally fixing a right choice.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h admini&s;tration began its attacks on our liberties with a &s;tamp act, but meeting with &s;trong oppo&s;ition they thought fit to repeal it. This act threw the colonies into &s;trong convul|&s;ions, and we rejoiced exceedingly on its repeal, and fondly hoped that we would enjoy future tranquility. But we were mi&s;taken. They never intended to relinqui&s;h the de&s;ign, but only to change their ground, that which they fir&s;t pitched upon not &s;eeming tenable. An American revenue granted by a Briti&s;h Parliament was the object, and they never lo&s;t &s;ight of it; for they &s;oon re|newed their attacks upon principles which they thought more favourable to their intentions; but meeting with as little &s;ucce&s;s in that, as in the preceding attempt, they &s;u&s;pended their mea&s;ures for a time, in hopes of lulling us into a carele&s;s &s;ecurity. They accordingly once more returned to the charge, and endeavoured to effect by cunning and arrifice what they had heretofore attempted in vain on every other peaceable plan. This not &s;ucceeding, they were reduced to their la&s;t &s;hift of bullying and force. They levied armies, appointed generals of reputation to command, and &s;ent them among&s;t us, we may know their commi&s;&s;ion by their conduct; for after abu&s;ing, brow-beating and in&s;ulting, after &s;tarving and tarring and fea|thering, after offering every po&s;&s;ible injury which a free people could bear, without obtaining their ends, and every other mea|&s;ure failing, they drew the &s;word, and at once reduced us to the
<PB N="56" REF="59">dire alternative of &s;ubmitting to their illegal claims of juri&s;diction, or entering into the bloody conte&s;t. Like men determined to be free we cho&s;e the latter. It now re&s;ts on the la&s;t argument, an argument which finally &s;ettles all controver&s;ies of a like nature. The plan of operation is now opened, and they who &s;tand to it with the mo&s;t &s;teady per&s;everance mu&s;t finally &s;ucceed. This is the decree of providence in all ca&s;es, <Q>he that per&s;evereth unto the end &s;hall be &s;aved.</Q> We have, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, effectually baffled all their former at|tempts; but if we fail in this, all our former victories will only &s;erve to make our fall the more con&s;picuous and terrible.</P>
<P>I will not enquire what would have been the efficacy of any heretofore recommended, but untried means. The wor&s;t that can has happened, and it is with it we have now to deal; to relinqui&s;h it on our part, would be to give up the matter, for however any means might once have done, cowardice alone would now de&s;ert the field, and &s;lavery mu&s;t be the inevitable con&s;equence.</P>
<P>I do not wonder that war &s;its heavy on us, and that we are &s;omewhat re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y; but I &s;hall be &s;urprized, if we, who have &s;o long and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully oppo&s;ed tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;hould all on a &s;udden lo&s;e every de&s;ire of retaining our liberties. I am forced into this remark by the artful, cun|ning and de&s;igning manner in which &s;ome men talk of a recon|ciliation with Great-Britain; and the bug-bears they conjure up to frighten the timid, irre&s;olute and ignorant, from a &s;teady pro&s;ecution of tho&s;e means, which alone can help us in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances. Facts bear evidence from the beginning of the conte&s;t that every &s;cheme they ever recommended has, upon trial, proved inadequate to the end for which it was in|tended; yet they proceed. Beware of &s;uch men, they love neither their country, nor their liberties, &s;o much as &s;ome|thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>There are many I doubt not who are denominated Tories by the more zealous Whigs, who in their hearts wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s to our mea&s;ures, tho' they may be chagrined becau&s;e tho&s;e they propo&s;ed did not go down with the people; the&s;e are uniform and not very dangerous; but there are others, who under the cloke of friend&s;hip for the cau&s;e, harbour the bittere&s;t rancour and malice in their hearts. The&s;e talk favourably in general, though their di&s;cour&s;es mo&s;tly terminate with a <HI>doubt, &s;u&s;picion,</HI> or <HI>but,</HI> which give tho&s;e with whom they conver&s;e, rea&s;on to
<PB N="57" REF="60">dread &s;ome hidden de&s;ign, or approaching evil, which mo&s;t men have not properly attended to. They artfully recal your attention to a certain period, when all was peace and quiet|ne&s;s, and by pathetically lamenting the unhappy alteration, endeavour to impre&s;s your minds with an opinion that all our troubles aro&s;e from our&s;elves. They carefully avoid mention|ing the iniquitous mea&s;ures of the Briti&s;h government which produced them, and by keeping tho&s;e out of &s;ight, they gra|dually lead the unwary into the belief, that the men who have been mo&s;t active on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion in oppo&s;ing the tyran|nical proceedings of Great-Britain, and who have hazarded their all in defence of their country, have been actuated by &s;ini&s;ter motives in all they have done. If every man who hears &s;uch in&s;inuations were to a&s;k tho&s;e who ca&s;t them out, what mea&s;ures have not the men they condemn tried at one time or another to avoid the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, and &s;ave our liberties? What advantages can they reap by a &s;ucce&s;sful end of it, which every freeman on the continent will not reap equally with them? And in an un&s;ucce&s;sful clo&s;e of it, all will allow they mu&s;t be the greate&s;t &s;ufferers. Their lives mu&s;t go, let who will el&s;e e&s;cape. The&s;e que&s;tions might recal them to facts, and the&s;e facts would enable men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> judge aright.</P>
<P>Hone&s;ty could not &s;tand the force of a few pertinent que&s;tions, but the&s;e men have taken their leave of it, and like Mana&s;&s;eh of old, have &s;old them&s;elves to do wickedly. Were it not &s;o, could it be po&s;&s;ible for them in the face of the &s;un, to charge all our troubles on the New-England Pre&s;byterians, troubles which originally began, and have all along been kept up by a wicked admini&s;tration and a venal parliament. To make them the hatchers of mi&s;chiefs occa&s;ioned by uncon&s;titutional acts of parliament, and the only fomenters of our ju&s;t oppo&s;ition with a Penn&s;ylvanian Quaker, a Maryland and a Virginian Churchman, did more to effect than all the other men on the continent put together, is cruelty in the extreme. My heart bleeds when I think of &s;uch men; who would &s;ell the whole continent and all the blood on it for private advantage, and with whom a few thou&s;and guineas with a title would be e&s;teemed an equivalent for the lives, liberty and property of the freemen of a colony. May that God who &s;ees how little they can gain, if &s;ucce&s;sful, open their eyes and turn their hearts, e'er they be convinced by fatal experience, that he who purcha&s;es the whole world at the price of his &s;oul, is a very unwi&s;e dealer,
<PB N="58" REF="61">and makes but a poor bargain in the end. If the calls of virtue, the precepts of religion, and dictates of patrioti&s;m cannot awaken them to a &s;en&s;e of their duty, yet Norfolk might open their eyes. But let them do as they plea&s;e, we ought to act wi&s;ely. If we do not make &s;uch a &s;ettlement now as will &s;ecure the privileges we contend for to po&s;terity, we entail either &s;lavery or a civil war on our children. This is certain, let what will be doubtful. Look round you then, view your offspring, and tell me, are you willing to leave them &s;uch a legacy? Do not trifle on this occa|&s;ion, all your other legacies mu&s;t derive their true value from the part you now take in this conte&s;t. Think not that the God who charges him with wor&s;e than infidelity who provides not for his own, and tho&s;e of his hou&s;hold, will ju&s;tify you in returning to the &s;tate you were in when our troubles began, and thereby delivering over your offspring to the mi&s;chievous machinations of a power that from the beginning has &s;et right, ju&s;tice, and mercy at defiance, and in all her deliberations con&s;idered nothing but her ability to execute.</P>
<P>Look to the year 1763, that happy period, as many &s;o fondly call it, and &s;ee what &s;afety there is to America in &s;uch a &s;ituation. Lord North has &s;aid, "If that is all they want, we are agreed;" and the &s;aying plea&s;es many of you. His Lord&s;hip, like others, who have learned wi&s;dom by experience, wi&s;hes to have all to begin again believing that he could more ea&s;ily effect his purpo&s;e by other means than tho&s;e he is at pre&s;ent pur&s;uing. Swallow the bait and you are undone forever.</P>
<P>Can any man in his &s;en&s;es believe, that he who has &s;o long, and &s;o invariably pur&s;ued his point again&s;t the &s;en&s;e of the be&s;t men in the nation, will finally de&s;ert his ma&s;ter's mo&s;t favourite &s;cheme &s;o ea&s;ily? Has he uttered a &s;ingle &s;yllable that can make the mo&s;t credulous believe that he is convinced of the inju&s;tice of his conduct? He confe&s;&s;es he was deceived; but wherein lay the deception? In believing that fewer troops would effect a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion than he is now convinced mu&s;t be employed. Here lay the deception he complains of, and he is therefore determined to &s;end his terms with &s;uch an armed force, as he expects will frighten you into a compliance. Does this lock like the conduct of one who de&s;igns to relinqui&s;h his claims? Were he or his ma&s;ter &s;en&s;ible of the inju&s;tice of their proceedings and the wrongs they have done us, they would both &s;peak a very different language. Why does he call you rebels? Why call in foreign troops to his aid? Why does his ma&s;ter lament &s;o
<PB N="59" REF="62">pathetically, that the exten&s;ive operations of the war he means to carry on again&s;t you, will exhau&s;t his funds and increa&s;e the public debts, while he has not a &s;ingle tear to &s;hed, not a groan, nor as much as a &s;igh for all the blood he has already &s;pilt, and yet means to &s;pill, if he wi&s;hes to allow you &s;ecurity to your privileges? Oh! George! The day thou uttered&s;t that &s;enti|ment in the face of the &s;un, thou gave&s;t up all title to humanity. <Q>Among the many unavoidable ill con&s;equences of this re|bellion, none affects me more &s;en&s;ibly, &s;ays the King, than the extraordinary burthen it mu&s;t create to my faithful &s;ubjects.</Q> "Mo&s;t humane Prince! mo&s;t pious Sovereign! mo&s;t affectionate father of thy people! an addition to thy Briti&s;h &s;ubjects burthens to obtain a mo&s;t unrighteous purpo&s;e of thy own, affects thee in order to reconcile them to the bearing of it; but to &s;pill the blood of thy oppre&s;&s;ed American &s;ubjects di&s;turbs not thy guiltle&s;s con&s;cience! Let me tell thee, O King, that there is a God who &s;ees through the veil that covers thy deceit, and who hears the cry of the needy, and regards the prayer of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, who will recompence vengeance on the wicked, though &s;upported by the power of Great Britain. Our weak|ne&s;s is &s;ufficient in his hands for the purpo&s;e, If thine and thy mini&s;ters are not evil again&s;t us, why did&s;t thou not hearken to the repeated prayers of thy di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects in America? Why do&s;t thou not recal thy troops, repeal the acts, indemnify us for what we have &s;uffered, and offer any further &s;ecurity to our rights, which we may think nece&s;&s;ary? Thou beganne&s;t the attack, and this is thy duty; be&s;ides, thou ha&s;t an obedient parliament, which di&s;putes not thy will, and all this is in thy power, and in no one's el&s;e."</P>
<P>Had the King made a &s;peech to the hou&s;e recommending the&s;e things, he would have given unequivocal proof of his hone&s;t intentions, and it might ju&s;tly be termed gracious. But who can tru&s;t a Prince, who while he &s;peaks the language of peace and humanity with his lips, has nothing but cruelty and war in his conduct. The man who does, may have the inno|cence of the dove, but he cannot be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the wi&s;dom of the &s;erpent. I conclude by entreating you, that as you love your children, and their happine&s;s, you never de&s;ert your pre|&s;ent oppo&s;ition, until you obtain &s;uch a plan of con&s;titutional vigour, as &s;hall put it at all times in your power to &s;ecure your|&s;elves and your de&s;cendants from tyrannical encroachments. This you never had, nor never can have, on the plan of your
<PB N="60" REF="63">former dependance. Remember, I call the Deity to witne&s;s, that I have warned you again&s;t de&s;troying your offspring, and prayed you to be on your guard again&s;t the &s;nares of the in&s;idious. May he who acts from a principle of humanity and benevo|lence to mankind finally meet with &s;ucce&s;s, and may the &s;chemes of hypocrites be bla&s;ted.</P>

<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are the mini&s;ter of the American department. You have the character of a religious man, a rare virtue in a modern &s;tate&s;man. It has become my duty and intere&s;t to ad|dre&s;s you, on the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of affairs in America. I know the Americans well; their &s;tronge&s;t and ruling pa&s;&s;ion was their affection to their mother country; the honour, the glory of Great Britain they e&s;teemed as their greate&s;t happine&s;s; a large portion of the &s;ame affection remains; nothing but repeated injuries and inju&s;tice could have le&s;&s;ened it. My Lord, from a wanton and avaricious exerci&s;e of power, the mini&s;try of Great Britain have heaped injuries on the heads of the Americans, that no one period of hi&s;tory can parellel.</P>
<P>The practice of the Egyptians in &s;mothering the children of the I&s;raelites in the birth, the &s;words of Cortez and Pizarro, who &s;lew millions of innocent Mixicans and Peruvians, the dreadful famine brought by the Ea&s;t India Company upon the poor Ea&s;t-Indians mu&s;t all be brought into one &s;cale, to &s;erve as any &s;ort of balance to the &s;y&s;tem of de&s;olation, that you and your brother mini&s;ters, are meditating and daily practi&s;ing again&s;t the unhappy people of North America.</P>
<P>The elements, which the providence of God hath given for all his creatures, you have the pre&s;umption to deprive them of, Fire, &s;word, famine, and de&s;olation, &s;hew the vicinity of your fleets and armies; children and &s;ervants are animated to ri&s;e and &s;laughter their benefactors. No &s;pecies of cruelty, which the wit or malice of man or devile could advi&s;e, but are practi&s;ed again&s;t the Americans.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64">Do you believe in God, my Lord, and direct the&s;e things? Do you believe that God made America as well as Great Britain? If you do, ponder, con&s;ider well; what an&s;wer you will give if you e&s;cape puni&s;hment in this world, when you come to be que&s;tioned before the Throne of God, for the de&s;truction you have made of his creatures, the work of his hands, to whom he granted life and liberty, earth, air and water equally as to your&s;elf: and yet pre&s;umptuous man, you have dared to coun|teract his providence! Have you con&s;cience my Lord? If you have, I would not for the empire of a thou&s;and worlds be Lord Dartmouth? But, my Lord, it is not to awaken your con&s;cience <HI>only</HI> that I write you this letter: the flame of civil war, by your management, hath extended far and wide in America; battles have been fought, numbers have been &s;lain, and pri&s;oners taken on both &s;ides; the Americans have in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion ten for one, and among them many men of rank, Pre&s;cot, Pre&s;ton, Stopford and others; they are all treated with tenderne&s;s and regard, while the pri&s;oners you have taken are treated with &s;everity, carried to England in irons, there, as it is &s;aid, to be tried, and of cour&s;e condemned and executed, or in other words, under form of law murdered!</P>
<P>My Lord, if there be any thing on earth or in heaven that you re&s;pect, avoid that rock&mdash;You have Col. Allen, Capt.

<HEAD><HI>Ob&s;ervations on</HI> LORD NORTH'S <HI>Conciliatory</HI> PLAN.</HEAD>
<P>I CANNOT recal an idea to my mind more amazingly ab&s;urd and &s;tupid than the idea of Lord North's &s;econd attempt to gull the Coloni&s;ts into a belief of his inclination to hold out to them terms of a &s;afe and amicable reconciliation with Great Britain. No one is ignorant that the Americans have offered
<PB N="62" REF="65">every thing that can po&s;&s;ibly be devi&s;ed to bury the injurious and en&s;laving claims of admini&s;tration, in perpetual oblivion, and leave matters on the &s;ame footing they were before the pretence was held up. Tho&s;e generous propo&s;als, however often repea|ted, have as often been rejected with an in&s;olent contempt, and yet the <HI>profound politician</HI> tells his opponents in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, that he is heartily inclined to a reconciliation with the Colonies, and willing to put them in the &s;ituation they &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ire; that is, &s;ays he, to a courtier demanding explanation, <HI>in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute dependance on the Briti&s;h Par|liament in all ca&s;es what&s;oever;</HI> for, &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, they were unque&s;tionably thus dependant in 1763. Had his Lord|&s;hip entirely forgot the &s;ucce&s;s of his former experiment, perhaps a trial of the &s;ame wretched <HI>trick</HI> over again, might have appear|ed le&s;s rediculous. I may indeed &s;ay, le&s;s in&s;ulting to the lowe&s;t under&s;tanding. I would a&s;k the mo&s;t credulous votary for making up the di&s;pute, what <HI>po&s;&s;ible grounds</HI> they perceive to found their expectation of a permanent reconciliation upon? Has any thing lately turned up, which has indicated a change of di&s;po&s;ition in the Prince or his favourites? Can a majority, which have been &s;ecured from one &s;even years to another, by pure force of corruption, be depended on to remain firm to a &s;laugh|tering, plundering and de&s;olating court, and &s;hare the dete&s;tation of pre&s;ent and future ages, for mere nothing? Has the court re&s;olved to ca&s;t Bernard, Hutchin&s;on and daughter, Richard&s;on the Murderer, crazy John Malcom, and Richard&s;on the recent volunteer, out on the common? I tell you, nay! You have a fre&s;h in&s;tance of the firmne&s;s of the cabinet, in adding another three thou&s;and pound pen&s;ioner to the li&s;t, in a conjuncture, when all mankind will confe&s;s there is need of &s;aving. The&s;e burthen|&s;ome pen&s;ions mu&s;t come from &s;ome part of the dominions! If Great-Britain and Ireland have conceived &s;uch a mortal hatred to America, that they can hug her mo&s;t inveterate enemies in their bo&s;oms, and vote them &s;uch munificent rewards for draw|her into &s;o de&s;tructive a civil war, we cannot be &s;afe in the power of &s;uch enemies. If they abound in re&s;ources as largely as Mr. Wedderburne and others boa&s;t they do, let them cea&s;e complaining of their poverty, and contentedly di&s;charge their own national debt, rather than go on augmenting it, by their efforts to &s;addle it, with an unlimited pen&s;ion li&s;t, on America. Does the nation bear the weight of the pre&s;ent unnatural quarrel with America on other terms, than a firm a&s;&s;urance of the Court,
<PB N="63" REF="66">that millions of leading men's dependants &s;hall be provided for in America, for whom places can by no means be found at home. Is not the very genius of the people of Great-Britain and Ireland corrupted, in&s;omuch, that the views of young fellows of educa|tion, or any connection with men of note, are altogether &s;et on public money? Can our peaceable men indulge a gleam of hope, that this humour will alter, or that youths, bred in idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation, will become indu&s;trious and difintere&s;ted patriots? If not they mu&s;t then be &s;o weak as to conceit, that mini&s;ters will become le&s;s fond of fingering the public money, and &s;ecuring them&s;elves in places of power and profit by means of it; indeed, that they will become more hone&s;t and &s;aving of the national money than tho&s;e the con&s;titution has appointed as a check upon them. It is no wonder they tell of &s;ending a formidable fleet and army to bring over terms of reconciliation, when they are in no one article different from the terms they fir&s;t aimed to impo&s;e. Had the mini&s;ter, or more properly the ob&s;tinate author of all our troubles, had the remote&s;t idea of favouring us with a government of laws, which had any re&s;pect to the &s;ecurity of our lives and properties, he had long &s;ince granted with a good grace, petitions, made and repeated with the mo&s;t dutiful and per&s;evering affection, which a&s;ked for nothing more! <HI>Sed aut Cae&s;ar aut nullus,</HI> &s;eems the unalterable determination of the man, who &s;oothed our already elated expectations, by an inaugural declaration, that he <HI>gloried</HI> in the name of Briton, at that time, a di&s;tinctive characteri&s;tic of the patrons of univer&s;al liberty. If therefore the whole body of the governing, and influential part of the governed in Great Britain, be unalterably &s;et upon extorting tribute from the Colonies; and the better to &s;ecure the laws, and executors of tho&s;e laws, dependant only on them&s;elves for appointment, continuance and &s;upport; and all the&s;e to be extended at their &s;ole plea&s;ure, it may readily be determined in what condition, the ab&s;olutely pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubjects of &s;uch an unnatural u&s;urpation would quickly be. It is evident they have concluded on two things, viz. to make a bold pu&s;h for our entire &s;ubjection, as their ends would be thereby more readily an&s;wered; but that being found impracticable, we are to be tried with negociation, in which all the craft, duplicity and punic faith of admini&s;tration is to be expected. Pray God it may be wi&s;ely and firmly guard|ed againi&s;t! The worthy and honourable John Collins, E&s;q; of New-Port, Rhode I&s;land, on the arrival of Lord North's la&s;t conciliatory plan, ob&s;erved, that notwith&s;tanding the expo&s;ure of his large e&s;tate, to whatever depredations the enemy &s;aw fit
<PB N="64" REF="67">to make upon it, he was more concerned for the probable &s;ucce&s;s of their arts than arms. Had the Americans in general the wi&s;dom and firmne&s;s of that gentleman, matters would not have come to the pre&s;ent melancholy lengths we find them. However, in the great and general plan of him who putteth down and &s;etteth up &s;tates, this is doubtle&s;s an indi&s;pen&s;ible part, and there|fore not to be complained of; but it has amazed me to contem|plate the numerous in&s;tances of di&s;appointment our enemies have met with, in every plot they have laid for our de&s;truction. How did Bernard and Hutchin&s;on flatter them&s;elves with the number of friends they had in the &s;everal towns of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and thought that a very trifling force, from the other &s;ide of the water, added to their minions, dependants and expectants, would cru&s;h a little turbulent faction, who di&s;turbed their darling mea|&s;ures? Certainly men intoxicated with a lu&s;t of ab&s;olute power found &s;omething in the appearance of things to tole them on to an object &s;o grateful to their fonde&s;t wi&s;hes; otherwi&s;e they would have been contented to augment and confirm their power by &s;uch unperceived degrees that the <HI>happy days</HI> many tell us we have enjoyed under a continual invading u&s;urpation, would not yet have been &s;o &s;en&s;ibly interrupted. No le&s;s has the &s;o often extolled Gov. Tryon been di&s;appointed in his benevolent in|tentions re&s;pecting New-York. His band on Long-I&s;land, and the ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's river, with Sir John John&s;on among his va&s;&s;als, gave great hopes of having matters in a fine train before the invincible armada arrived in the &s;pring; in&s;tead of which, it is probable the active General Lee will &s;o &s;ortify that place, that all the force they can &s;end again&s;t it, will be in&s;ufficient to reduce it. Dunmore, with all his wanton ravage, has done little more than exa&s;perate the Virginians, and convinced that brave colony, that they can be formidable to &s;avages on the ea&s;t, as well as we&s;t &s;ide of their dominion. Carleton's Canadians make no &s;uch figure in the harrangues of the pen&s;ioner as they did la&s;t year; and in ca&s;e foreigners are to be procured to be poured in upon us, the greate&s;t oppo&s;ers of our total &s;eperation from Britain acknowledge, they would then no longer defer a declaration of independancy, and application to other powers for their protection. To this the whole &s;cene appears rapidly advancing, in my view, as ha&s;tily as infinite wi&s;dom thinks proper to conduct it; and if this be his mo&s;t gracious de&s;ign, he will work, and none &s;hall hinder.

<HEAD>The Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>INDEPENDANCY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SINCE the publication of the fir&s;t edition of this pamphlet, or rather on the &s;ame day on which it came out, the King's Speech made its appearance in this city. Had the &s;pirit of pro|phecy directed the birth of this production, it could not have brought it forth at a more &s;ea&s;onable juncture, or a more nece&s;&s;ary time. The bloody mindedne&s;s of the one, &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity of pur&s;uing the doctrine of the other. Men read by way of revenge. And the Speech, in&s;tead of terrifying, prepared a way for the manly principles of Independance.</P>
<P>Ceremony, and even &s;ilence, from whatever motive they may ari&s;e, have a hurtful tendency, when they give the lea&s;t degree of countenance to ba&s;e and wicked performances! wherefore if this maxim be admitted, it naturally follows, that the King's Speech, as being a piece of fini&s;hed villainy, de&s;erved, and &s;till de&s;erves, a general execration, both by the Congre&s;s and the people. Yet, as the dome&s;tic tranquility of a nation depends greatly on the <HI>cha&s;tity</HI> of what may properly be called NATIONAL MANNERS, it is often better, to pa&s;s &s;ome things over in &s;ilent di&s;dain, than to make u&s;e of &s;uch new methods of di&s;like, as might introduce the lea&s;t innovation on that guardian of our peace and &s;afety. And perhaps, it is chiefly owing to this prudent delicacy, that the King's Speech hath not, before now, &s;uffered a public execution. The &s;peech, if it may be called one, is nothing better than a wilful audacious libel again&s;t the truth, the common good, and the exi&s;tence of mankind; and is a formal and pompous method of offering up human &s;acrifices to the pride of tyrants. But this general ma&s;&s;acre of mankind, is one of the privileges, and the certain con&s;equence of Kings; for as nature knows them <HI>not,</HI> they know <HI>not her,</HI> and although they are beings of our <HI>own</HI> creating, they know not <HI>us,</HI> and are become the gods of their creators. The &s;peech hath one good quality, which is, that it is not calculated to deceive, neither can we, even if we would, be deceived by it. Brutality and tyranny appear on the face of it. It leaves us at no lo&s;s: And every line convinces, even in the moment of reading, that he, who hunts the wood for prey, the naked and untutored Indian, in le&s;s a Savage than the King of Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="69">Sir John Dalrymple, the putative father of a whining je&s;uitieal piece, fall aciou&s;ly called, "<HI>The addre&s;s of the people of</HI> England, <HI>to the Inhabitants of</HI> America," hath, perhaps, from a vain &s;uppo&s;ition, that the people <HI>here</HI> were to be frightened at the pomp and de|&s;cription of a king, giving, (though very unwi&s;ely on his part) the real character of the pre&s;ent one: "But," &s;ays the writer, "if you are inclined to pay compliments to an admini&s;tration which we do not complain of, (meaning the Marquis of Rockingham's at the repeal of the Stamp act,) it is very unfair in you to withhold them from that prince <HI>by who&s;e</HI> NOD ALONE, <HI>they were permitted to do any thing.</HI>" This is toryi&s;m with a witne&s;s! Here is idolatry even without a ma&s;k: And he who can calmly hear and dige&s;t &s;uch doctrine, hath forfeited his claim to rationality&mdash;an apo&s;tate from the order of manhood, and ought to be con&s;idered&mdash;as one, who hath not only given up the proper dignity of man, but &s;unk him&s;elf beneath the rank of animals, and contemptibly crawl through the world like a worm.</P>
<P>However, it matters very little now, what the king of England either &s;ays or does; he hath wickedly broken through every moral and human obligation, trampled nature and con&s;cience beneath his feet; and by a &s;teady and con&s;titutional &s;pirit of in&s;olence and cruelty, procured for him&s;elf an univer&s;al hatred. It is <HI>now</HI> the intere&s;t of America to provide for her&s;elf, She hath already a large and young family, whom it is more her duty to take care of, than to be granting away her property to &s;upport a power who is become a reproach to the names of men and chri&s;tians. YE, who&s;e office it is to watch over the morals of a nation, of what&s;oever &s;ect or denomination ye are, as well as ye, who are more immediately the guardians of the public liberty, if ye wi&s;h to pre&s;erve your native country uncontaminated by Euro|pean corruption, ye mu&s;t in &s;ecret wi&s;h a &s;eperation&mdash;But leaving the moral part to private reflection, I &s;hall chiefly con|fine my farther remarks to the following heads:
<LIST>
<ITEM>Fir&s;t, That it is the intere&s;t of America to be &s;eperated from Britain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, Which is the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t practicable plan, reconciliation or independance? with &s;ome occa&s;ional remarks.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In &s;upport of the fir&s;t, I could, if I judged it proper, produce the opinion of &s;ome of the able&s;t and mo&s;t experienced men on this continent; and who&s;e &s;entiments, on that head, are not yet publicly known. It is in reality a &s;elf-evident po&s;ition: For no nation, in a &s;tate of foreign dependance, limited in its commerce, and cramped and fettered in its legi&s;lative powers, can ever
<PB N="67" REF="70">arrive at any material eminence. America doth not yet know what opulence is; and although the progre&s;s which &s;he hath made, &s;tands unparalleled in the hi&s;tory of other nations, it is but childhood, compared with what &s;he would be capable of arriving at, had &s;he, as &s;he ought to have, the legi&s;lative powers in her own hands. England is, at this time, proudly coveting what would do her no good, were &s;he to accompli&s;h it; and the continent he&s;itating on a matter, which will be her final ruin if neglected. It is the commerce, and not the conque&s;t of America, by which England is to be benefited, and that would in a great mea&s;ure continue, were the countries as independant of each other as France and Spain; becau&s;e in many articles, neither can go to a better market. But it is the independance of this country on Britain or any other, which is now the main and only object worthy of contention, and which, like all other truths di&s;covered by nece&s;&s;ity, will appear clearer and &s;tronger every day.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Becau&s;e it will come to that one time or other.</P>
<P>Secondly. Becau&s;e the longer it is delayed, the harder it will be to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>I have frequently amu&s;ed my&s;elf both in public and private companies, with &s;ilently remarking the &s;pecious errors of tho&s;e who &s;peak without reflecting. And among the many which I have heard, the following &s;eems the mo&s;t general, viz. that had this rupture happened forty or fifty years hence, in&s;tead of <HI>now,</HI> the Continent would have been more able to have &s;haken off the dependance. To which I reply, that our military ability <HI>at this time,</HI> ari&s;es from the experience gained in the late war, and which in forty or fifty years time, would have been totally extinct. The Continent would not, by that time, have had a General, or even a military officer left; and we, or tho&s;e who may &s;ucceed us, would have been as ignorant of martial matters as the ancient Indians: And this &s;ingle po&s;ition, clo&s;ely attended to, will unan&s;werably prove, that the pre&s;ent time is preferable to all others: The argument turns thus: At the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t war, we had experience, but wanted numbers; and forty or fifty years hence, we &s;hould have numbers, without experience; wherefore, the proper point of time mu&s;t be &s;ome particular point between the two extremes, in which a &s;ufficiency of the former remains, and a proper encrea&s;e of the latter is obtained: And that point of time is the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>The reader will pardon this digre&s;&s;ion, as it does not properly come under the head I fir&s;t &s;et out with, and to which I again return by the following po&s;ition, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="71">Should affairs be patched up with Britain, and &s;he to remain the governing and &s;overeign power of America, (which as matters are now circum&s;tanced, is giving up the point entirely) we &s;hall deprive our&s;elves of the very means of &s;inking the debt we have, or may contract. The value of the back lands, which &s;ome of the provinces are clande&s;tinely deprived of, by the unju&s;t exten|tion of the limits of Canada, valued only at five pounds &s;terling per hundred acres, amount to upwards of twenty five millions, Penn&s;ylvania currency; and the quit-rents at one penny &s;terling per acre, to two millions yearly.</P>
<P>It is by the &s;ale of tho&s;e lands, that the debt may be &s;unk, without burthen to any, and the quit rent re&s;erved thereon, will always le&s;&s;en, and in time will wholly &s;upport the yearly expence of government. It matters not how long the debt is in paying, &s;o that the lands when &s;old, be applied to the di&s;|charge of it, and for the execution of which, the Congre&s;s for the time being, will be the continental tru&s;tees.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the &s;econd head, viz. Which is the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t practicable plan, <HI>Reconciliation or Independance;</HI> with &s;ome occa&s;ional remarks.</P>
<P>He who takes nature for his guide, is not ea&s;ily beaten out of his argument, and on that ground, I an&s;wer <HI>generally, That</HI> Independance <HI>being a</HI> &s;ingle &s;imple line, <HI>contained within our&s;elves; and reconciliation, a matter exceedingly perplexed and complicated, and in which, a treacherous capricious court is to interfere, gives the an&s;wer without a doubt.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;tate of America is truly alarming to every man who is capable of reflection. Without law, without government, without any other mode of power than what is founded on, and granted by courte&s;y. Held together by an unexampled concurrence of &s;entiment, which, is neverthele&s;s &s;ubject to change, and which, every &s;ecret enemy is endeavouring to di&s;&s;olve. Our pre&s;ent condition, is, Legi&s;lation without law, wi&s;dom without a plan; a con&s;titution without a name; and, what is &s;trangely a&s;toni&s;hing, perfect Independance contending for dependance. The in&s;tance is without a precedent; the ca&s;e never exi&s;ted before; and who can tell what may be the event? The property of no man is &s;ecure in the pre&s;ent unbraced &s;y&s;tem of things. The mind of the multitude is left at random, and &s;eeing no fixed object before them, they pur&s;ue &s;uch as fancy or opinion &s;tarts. Nothing is criminal; there is no &s;uch thing as trea&s;on; wherefore, every one thinks him&s;elf at liberty to act [as he plea&s;es. The Tories would not have dared to
<PB N="69" REF="72">a&s;&s;emble offen&s;ively, had they known that their lives, by that act, were forfeited to the laws of the &s;tate. A line of di&s;tinction &s;hould be drawn, between Engli&s;h &s;oldiers taken in battle, and inhabi|tants of America taken in arms. The fir&s;t are pri&s;oners, but the latter traitors. The one forfeits his liberty, the other his head.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding our wi&s;dom, there is a vi&s;ible feeblene&s;s in &s;ome of our proceedings, which gives encouragement to di&s;&s;en|tions. The Continental Belt is too loo&s;ely buckled. And if &s;omething is not done in time, it will be too late to do any thing, and we &s;hall fall into a &s;tate in which, neither <HI>Reconciliation</HI> not <HI>Independance</HI> will be practicable. The king and his worthle&s;s adherents are got at the old game of dividing the Continent, and there are not wanting among us, Printers, who will be bu&s;y in &s;preading &s;pecious fal&s;ehoods. The artful and hypocritical letter, which appeared a few months ago, in two of the New-York papers, and likewi&s;e in two others, is an evidence, that there are men who want either judgment or hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y getting into holes and corners, and talking of recon|ciliation: But do &s;uch men &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider; how difficult the ta&s;k is, and how dangerous it may prove, &s;hould the Continent divide thereon. Do they take within their view, all the various orders of men, who&s;e &s;ituation and circum&s;tances, as well as their own, are to be con&s;idered therein. Do they put them|&s;elves in the place of the &s;ufferer, who&s;e <HI>all</HI> is <HI>already</HI> gone, and of the &s;oldier, who hath quitted <HI>all</HI> for the defence of his country. If their ill-judged moderation be &s;uited to their own private &s;ituations <HI>only,</HI> regardle&s;s of others, the event will convince them, that "they are reckoning without their ho&s;t."</P>
<P>Put us, &s;ay &s;ome, upon the footing we were on in &s;ixty-three: To which I an&s;wer, the reque&s;t is not <HI>now</HI> in the power of Britain to comply with, neither will &s;he propo&s;e it; but if it were, and even &s;hould be granted, I a&s;k, as a rea&s;onable que&s;tion, By what means is &s;uch a corrupt and faithle&s;s court to be kept to its engagements? Another parliament, nay, even the pre&s;ent, may hereafter repeal the obligation, on the pretence of its being violently obtained, or unwi&s;ely granted; and in that ca&s;e, Where is our redre&s;s?&mdash;No going to law with nations; cannon are the barri&s;ters of crowns; and the &s;word, not of ju&s;tice, but of war decides the &s;uit. To be on the footing of &s;ixty-three, it is not &s;ufficient, that the laws only be put on the &s;ame &s;tate; but that our circum&s;tances, likewi&s;e be put on the &s;ame &s;tate; our burnt and de&s;troyed towns repaired or built up, our private lo&s;&s;es made good, our public debts (contracted for defence) di&s;charged;
<PB N="70" REF="73">otherwi&s;e we &s;hall be millions wor&s;e than we were at that en|viable period. Such a reque&s;t, had it been complied with a year ago, would have won the heart and &s;oul of the Continent, but now it is too late. "The Rubicon is pa&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the taking up arms, merely to enforce the repeal of a pecuniary law, &s;eems as unwarrantable by the divine law, and as repugnant to human feelings, as the taking up arms to enforce the obedience thereto. The object, on either &s;ide, doth not ju&s;tify the means; for the lives of men are too valuable, to be ca&s;t away on &s;uch trifles, It is the violence which is done and threatened to our per&s;ons; the de&s;truction of our property by an armed force; the inva&s;ion of our country by fire and &s;word, which con&s;cientiou&s;ly qualifies the u&s;e of arms: And the in&s;tant, in which &s;uch a mode of defence became nece&s;&s;ary, all &s;ubjection to Britain ought to have cea&s;ed; and the indepen|dancy of America, &s;hould have been con&s;idered, as dating its aera from, and publi&s;hed by, <HI>the fir&s;t mu&s;ket that was fired again&s;t her.</HI> This line is a line of con&s;i&s;tency; neither drawn by caprice, nor extended by ambition; but produced by a chain of events, of which the colonies were not the authors.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the&s;e remarks, with the following timely and well intended hint. We ought to reflect, that there are three different ways, by which an independancy may hereafter be offected; and that <HI>one</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>three,</HI> will one day or other, be the fate of America, viz. By the legal voice of the people in Congre&s;s; by a military power; or by a mob: It may not always happen that our &s;oldiers are citizens, and the multitude a body of rea&s;onable men; vertue, as I have already remarked, is not hereditary, neither is it perpetual. Should an indepen|dency be brought about by the fir&s;t of tho&s;e means, we have every opportunity and every encouragement before us, to form the noble&s;t pure&s;t con&s;titution on the face of the earth. We have it in our power to begin the world over again. A &s;itua|tion, &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent, hath not happened &s;ince the days of Noah until now. The birth day of a new world is at hand, and a race of men, perhaps as numerous as all Europe contains, are to receive their portion of freedom from the event of a few months. The reflection is awful and in this point of view, how trifling, how ridiculous, do the little paltry cavillings, of a few weak or intere&s;ted men appear, when weighed again&s;t the bu&s;ine&s;s of a world.</P>
<P>Should we neglect the pre&s;ent favourable and inviting period, and an inpependance be hereafter effected by other means, we mu&s;t charge the con&s;equence to our&s;elves, or to tho&s;e rather,
<PB N="71" REF="74">who&s;e narrow and perjudiced &s;ouls, are habitually oppo&s;ing the &s;ures, without either inquiring or reflecting. There are rea|&s;ons to be given in &s;upport of independance, which men &s;hould rather privately think of, than be publickly told of. We ought not now to be debating whether we &s;hall be independant or not, but, anxious to accompli&s;h it on a firm &s;ecure, and hono|rable ba&s;is, and unea&s;y rather that it is not yet began upon. Every day convinces us of its nece&s;&s;ity. Even the Tories (if &s;uch beings yet remain among us) &s;hould, of all men, be the mo&s;t &s;olicitous to promote it; for as the appointment of com|mittees at fir&s;t, protected them from popular rage, &s;o, a wi&s;e and well e&s;tabli&s;hed form of government, will be the only certain means of continuing it &s;ecurely to them. <HI>Wherefore,</HI> if they have not virtue enough to be WHIGS, they ought to have prudence enough to wi&s;h for Independance.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Independance is the only BOND that can tye and keep us together. We &s;hall then &s;ee our object, and our ears will be legally &s;hut again&s;t the &s;chemes of an intriguing, as well as a cruel enemy. We &s;hall then too be on a proper footing to treat with Britain; for there is rea&s;on to conclude, that the pride of that court will be le&s;s hurt by treating with the Ameri|can &s;tates for terms of peace, than with tho&s;e &s;he denominates "rebellious &s;ubjects," for terms of accommodation. It is our delaying it that encourages her to hope for conque&s;t, and our backwardne&s;s tends only to prolong the war. As we have, without any good effect therefrom, withheld our trade to obtain a redre&s;s of our grievances, let us now try the alternative, by <HI>inde|pendantly</HI> redre&s;&s;ing them our&s;elves, and then offering to open the trade. The mercantile and rea&s;onable part in England will be &s;till with us; becau&s;e, peace with trade, is preferable to war without it. And if this offer is not accepted, other courts may be applied to. On the&s;e grounds I re&s;t the matter. And as no offer hath yet been made to refute the doctrine contained in the former editions of this pamphlet, it is a negative proof, that either the doctrine cannot be refuted, or, that the party in favour of it are too numerous to be oppo&s;ed. <HI>Wherefore,</HI> in&s;tead of gazing at each other with &s;u&s;picious or doubtful curio&s;ity, let each of us hold out to his neighbour the hearty hand of friend&s;hip, and unite in drawing, a line, which, like an act of oblivion, &s;hall bury in forgetfulne&s;s every former di&s;&s;ention. Let the names of Whig and Tory be extinct; and let none other be beard among us, than tho&s;e of <HI>a good citizen, an open and re&s;olute friend, and a virtuous &s;upporter of the rights of mankind and of the free and independant &s;tates of America.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>To the Repre&s;entatives of the Religious Society of the People called Quakers, or to &s;o many of them as were concerned in publi&s;hing a late piece, entitled</HI> <Q>The ANCIENT TESTIMONY and PRINCIPLES of the People called QUAKERS renewed, with Re&s;pect to the KING and GOVERNMENT, and touching the COMMOTIONS now prevailing in the&s;e and other parts of AMERICA, addre&s;&s;ed to the <HI>People in General.</HI></Q></HEAD>
<P>THE Writer of this, is one of tho&s;e few, who never di&s;|honors religion either by ridiculing, or cavilling at any denomination what&s;oever. To God and not to man, are all men accountable on the &s;core of religion. Wherefore, this epi&s;tle is not &s;o properly addre&s;&s;ed to you as a religious, but as a political body, dabbling in matters, which the profe&s;&s;ed Quietude of your Principles in&s;truct you not to meddle with.</P>
<P>As you have, without a proper authority for &s;o doing, put your&s;elves in the place of the whole body of the Quakers, &s;o, the writer of this, in order to be on an equal rank with your|&s;elves, is under the nece&s;&s;ity of putting him&s;elf in the place of all tho&s;e, who approve the very writings and principles, again&s;t which, your te&s;timony is directed: And he hath cho&s;en this &s;ingular &s;ituation, in order, that you might di&s;cover in him that pre&s;umption of character which you cannot &s;ee in your&s;elves. For neither he nor you can have any claim or title to <HI>Political Repre&s;entation.</HI></P>
<P>When men have departed from the right way, it is no wonder that they &s;tumble and fall. And it is evident from the manner in which ye have managed your te&s;timony, that politics, (as a religious body of men) is not your proper Walk; for however well adapted it might appear to you, it is, neverthele&s;s, a jum|ble of good and bad put unwi&s;ely together, and the conclu&s;ion drawn therefrom, both unnatural and unju&s;t.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t pages, (and the whole doth not make four) we give you credit for, and expect the &s;ame civility from you, be|cau&s;e the love and de&s;ire of peace is not confined to Quakeri&s;m, it is the natural, as well as, the religious wi&s;h of all denominati|ons of men. And on this ground, as men laboring to e&s;tabli&s;h an Independant Con&s;titution of our own, do we exceed all others in our hope, end, and aim. <HI>Our plan is peace forever.</HI> We are tired of contention with Britain, and can &s;ee no real end to it but in a final &s;eperation. We act con&s;i&s;tently, becau&s;e for the &s;ake of introducing an endle&s;s and uninterrupted peace, do we
<PB N="73" REF="76">bear the evils and burthens of the pre&s;ent day. We are endea|vouring, and will &s;till continue to endeavour, to &s;eperate and di&s;&s;olve a connection which hath already filled our land with blood; and which, while the name of it remains, will be the fatal cau&s;e of future mi&s;chiefs to both countries.</P>
<P>We fight neither for revenge nor conque&s;t; neither from pride nor pa&s;&s;ion; we are not in&s;ulting the world with our fleets and armies, nor ravaging the globe for plunder. Beneath the &s;hade of our own vines are we attacked; in our own hou&s;es, and on our own lands, is the violence committed again&s;t us. We view our enemies in the character of highway men and hou&s;e-breakers, and having no defence for our&s;elves in the civil law, are obliged to puni&s;h them by the military one, and apply the &s;word, in the very ca&s;e, where you have before now applied the halter&mdash;Perhaps we feel for the ruined and in&s;ulted &s;ufferers in all and every part of the Continent, with a degree of tenderne&s;s which hath not yet made its way into &s;ome of your bo&s;oms. But be ye &s;ure that ye mi&s;take not the cau&s;e and ground of your te&s;timony. Call not coldne&s;s of &s;oul, religion; nor put the Bigot in the place of the Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>O ye partial mini&s;ters of your own acknowledged principles. If the bearing arms be &s;inful, the fir&s;t going to war mu&s;t be more &s;o, by all the difference between wilful attack and unavoidable defence. Wherefore, if ye really preach from con&s;cience, and mean not to make a political hobby-hor&s;e of your religion, con|vince the world thereof by proclaiming your doctrine to our enemies, <HI>for they likewi&s;e bear arms.</HI> Give us proof of your &s;in|cerity by publi&s;hing it at St. James's, to the Commanders in chief at Bo&s;ton, to the Admirals and Captains who are piratically ravaging our coa&s;ts, and to all the murdering mi&s;creants who are acting in authority under <HI>Him</HI> whom ye profe&s;s to &s;erve.

<P>Alas! it &s;eems by the particular tendency of &s;ome part of your te&s;timony, and other parts of your conduct, as if, all &s;in was re|duced to, and comprehended in, <HI>the act of bearing arms,</HI> and that by the <HI>people only.</HI> Ye appear to have mi&s;taken party for con|&s;cience; becau&s;e the general tenor of your actions wants unifor|mity: and it is exceedingly difficult to give credit to many of your pretended &s;cruples; becau&s;e, we &s;ee them made by the &s;ame men, who, in the very in&s;tant that they are exclaiming again&s;t the mammon of this world, are neverthele&s;s hunting after it with a &s;tep as &s;teady as Time, and an appetite as keen as Death.</P>
<P>The quotation which ye have made from Proverbs, in the third page of your te&s;timony, that, <Q>when a man's ways plea&s;e the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him,</Q> is very unwi&s;ely cho&s;en on your part; becau&s;e, it amounts to a proof, that the king's ways (whom ye are &s;o de&s;irous of &s;up|porting) do <HI>not</HI> plea&s;e the Lord, otherwi&s;e, his reign would be in peace.</P>

<P>"It hath ever been our judgment and principle, &s;ince we were called to profe&s;s the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, manife&s;ted in our con|&s;ciences unto this day, that the &s;etting up and putting down kings and governments, is God's peculiar prerogative; for cau&s;es be&s;t known to him&s;elf: And that it is not our bu&s;ine&s;s to have any hand or contrivance therein; nor to be bu&s;y-bodies above our &s;tation, much le&s;s to plot and contrive the ruin or overturn of any of them, but to pray for the king, and &s;afety of our nation, and good of all men: That we may live a peaceable and quiet life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty; <HI>under the government which God is plea&s;ed to &s;et over us"</HI>&mdash;If the&s;e are really your principles why do you not abide by them? Why do you not leave that, which ye call God's Work, to be managed by him&s;elf? The&s;e very principles in&s;truct you to wait with patience and humility, for the event of all public mea&s;ures, and to receive that event as
<PB N="75" REF="78">the divine will towards you. <HI>Wherefore,</HI> what occa&s;ion is there for your <HI>political te&s;timony,</HI> if you fully believe what it contains? And the very publi&s;hing it proves, that either; ye do not believe what ye profe&s;s, or have not virtue enough to practice what ye believe.</P>
<P>The principles of Quakeri&s;m have a direct tendency to make a man the quiet and inoffen&s;ive &s;ubject of any, and every govern|ment which is &s;et over him. And if the &s;etting up and pulling down of kings and governments is God's peculiar prerogative, he mo&s;t certainly will not be robbed thereof by us; wherefore, the principle it&s;elf leads you to approve of every thing, which ever happened, or may happen to kings, as being his work. Oliver Cromwell thanks you. Charles, then, died not by the hands of man; and &s;hould the pre&s;ent proud imitators of him, come to the &s;ame untimely end, the writers and publi&s;hers of the te&s;timony, are bound by the doctrine it contains to applaud the fact. Kings are not taken away by miracles, neither are changes in govern|ments brought about by any other means than &s;uch as are com|mon and human; and &s;uch as we are now u&s;ing. Even the di&s;|per&s;ion of the Jews, though foretold by our Saviour, was effected by arms. Wherefore, as you refu&s;e to be the means on one &s;ide, ye ought not to be meddlers on the other; but to wait the i&s;&s;ue in &s;ilence? and unle&s;s ye can produce divine authority, to prove, that the Almighty who created and placed this new world at the greate&s;t di&s;tance it could po&s;&s;ibly &s;tand, ea&s;t and we&s;t, from every part of the old, doth, neverthele&s;s, di&s;approve of its being independant of the corrupt and abandoned court of Britain, un|le&s;s, I &s;ay, ye can &s;hew this, how can ye on the ground of your principles, ju&s;tify the exciting and &s;tirring up the people <Q>firmly to unite in the <HI>abhorrence</HI> of all &s;uch <HI>writings,</HI> and <HI>mea&s;ures,</HI> as evidence a de&s;ire and de&s;ign to break off the <HI>happy</HI> connexion we have hitherto enjoyed, with the kingdom of Great-Britain, and our ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary &s;ubordination to the king, and tho&s;e who are lawfully placed in authority under him.</Q> What a &s;lap of the face is here! The men, who in the very paragraph be|fore, have quietly and pa&s;&s;ively re&s;igned up the ordering, altering, and di&s;po&s;al of kings and governments into the hands of God, are now recalling their principles, and putting in for a &s;hare of the bu&s;ine&s;s. Is it po&s;&s;ible, that the conclu&s;ion, which is here ju&s;tly quoted, can any way follow from the doctrines laid down? The incon&s;i&s;tency is too glaring not to be &s;een; the ab&s;urdity too great not to be laughed at; and &s;uch as could only have been
<PB N="76" REF="79">made by tho&s;e, who&s;e under&s;tandings were darkened by the nar|row and crabbed &s;pirit of a de&s;pairing political party; for ye are not to be con&s;idered as the whole body of the Quakers, but only as a factional and fractional part thereof.</P>
<P>Here ends the examination of your te&s;timony; (which I call upon no man to abhor, as ye have done, but only to read and judge of fairly) to which I &s;ubjoin the following remark; <Q>that the &s;etting up and putting down of kings,</Q> mo&s;t certainly mean, the making him a king, who is yet not &s;o, and the making him no king who is already one. And pray what has this to do in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e? We neither mean to <HI>&s;et up</HI> nor to <HI>pull down,</HI> nei|ther to <HI>make</HI> nor to <HI>unmake,</HI> but to have nothing to <HI>do</HI> with them. Wherefore, your te&s;timony in whatever light it is viewed, &s;erves only to di&s;honor your judgment, and for many other rea&s;ons had better been let alone than publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e it tends to the decrea&s;e and reproach of all reli|gion whatever, and is of the utmo&s;t danger to &s;ociety, to make it a party in political di&s;putes.</P>
<P>Secondly, Becau&s;e it exhibits a body of men, numbers of whom di&s;avow the publi&s;hing political te&s;timonies, as being concerned therein and approvers thereof.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Becau&s;e it hath a tendency to undo that Continental harmony and friend&s;hip which your&s;elves by your late liberal and charatable donations hath lent a hand to e&s;tabli&s;h; and the pre&s;ervation of which, is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to us all.</P>
<P>And here without anger or re&s;entment I bid you farewel. Sincerely wi&s;hing, that as men and chri&s;tians, ye may alway fully and uninterruptedly enjoy every civil and religious right; and be, in your turn, the means of &s;ecuring it to others; but that the example which ye have unwi&s;ely &s;et, of mingling religion with politics, <HI>may be di&s;avowed and reprobated by every inhabitant of America.</HI></P>
