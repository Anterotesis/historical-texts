<P>PROSPECTS ON THE RUBICON OR, AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE POLITICS TO BE AGITATED AT THE MEETING OF PARLIAMENT.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AN expre&s;&s;ion in the Briti&s;h Parliament re&s;pecting the American war, alluding to Julius Cae&s;ar having pa&s;&s;ed the Rubicon, has on &s;everal occa&s;ions introduced that river as the figurative river of war.</P>
<P>Fortunately for England &s;he is yet on the peaceable &s;ide of the Rubicon; but as the flames once kindled are not always ea&s;ily extingui&s;hed, the hopes of peace are not &s;o clear as before the late my&s;terious di&s;pute began.</P>
<P>But while the calm la&s;ts, it may an&s;wer a very good purpo&s;e to take a view of the pro&s;pects, con&s;i&s;tent with the maxim, that he that goeth to war &s;hould fir&s;t &s;it down and count the co&s;t.</P>
<P>The nation has a young Mini&s;ter at its head, fond of him&s;elf, and deficient in ex|perience; and in&s;tances have often &s;hewn that judgment is a different thing to genius, and that the affairs of a nation are but un|&s;afely tru&s;ted where the benefit of experi|ence is wanting.</P>
<P>Illu&s;trations have been drawn from the circum&s;tances of the war before la&s;t to de|corate
<PB N="iv" REF="3">the character of the pre&s;ent Mini&s;ter, and, perhaps, they have been greatly over|drawn; for the management mu&s;t have been bad to have done le&s;s than what was then done, when we impartially con&s;ider the means, the force, and the money employed.</P>
<P>It was then Great Britain and America again&s;t France &s;ingly, for Spain did not join till nearly the end of the war. The great number of troops which the American Co|lonies then rai&s;ed and paid them&s;elves, were &s;ufficient to turn the &s;cale, if all other parts had been equal. France had not at that time attended to Naval Affairs &s;o much as &s;he has done &s;ince, and the capture of French &s;ailors before any declaration of war was made, which however it may be ju&s;tified upon po|licy, will always be ranked among the clan|de&s;tine arts of war, a&s;&s;ured a certain, but unfair advantage again&s;t her, becau&s;e it was like a man admini&s;tering a di&s;abling do&s;e over-night to the per&s;on whom he intends to challenge in the morning.</P>

<HEAD>PROSPECTS ON THE RUBICON, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>RIGHT by chance and wrong by &s;y&s;tem, are things &s;o frequently &s;een in the political world, that it becomes a proof of prudence neither to cen&s;ure nor applaud too &s;oon.</P>
<P>"The Rubicon is pa&s;t," was once given as a rea&s;on for pro&s;ecuting the mo&s;t expen|&s;ive war that England ever knew. Sore with the event, and groaning beneath a galling yoke of taxes, &s;he has again been led mini&s;terially on to the &s;hore of the &s;ame
<PB N="2" REF="5">delu&s;ive and fatal river, without being per|mitted to know the object or the rea&s;on why.</P>
<P>Expen&s;ive preparations have been gone into; fears, alarms, dangers, apprehen&s;ions, have been mi&s;tically held forth, as if the exi&s;t|ence of the nation was at &s;take, and at la&s;t the mountain has brought forth a Dutch mou&s;e.</P>
<P>Whoever will candidly review the pre|&s;ent national characters of England and France, cannot but be &s;truck with &s;urprize at the change that is taking place. The people of France are beginning to think for them|&s;elves, and the people of England re&s;igning up the privilege of thinking.</P>
<P>The affairs of Holland have been the bubble of the day; and a tax is to be laid on &s;hoes and boots (&s;o &s;ay the news-papers) for the &s;ervice of the Stadtholder of Hol|land. This will undoubtedly do honour to the nation by verifying the old Engli&s;h pro|verb, "Over &s;hoes, over boots."</P>
<P>But tho' Democrites could &s;carcely have forbore laughing at the folly, yet as &s;erious argument and &s;ound rea&s;oning are preferable
<PB N="3" REF="6">to ridicule, it will be be&s;t to quit the vein of unprofitable humour, and give the cau&s;e a fair inve&s;tigation. But before we do this, it may not be improper to take a general review of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y political matters that will naturally lead to a better under&s;tanding of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>What has been the event of all the wars of England, but an amazing accumulation of debt, and an unparalleled burthen of taxes. Sometimes the pretence has been to &s;upport one outlandi&s;h cau&s;e, and &s;ometimes another. At one time Au&s;tria, at another time Pru&s;&s;ia, and &s;o on; but the con&s;equence has always been taxes. A few men have enriched them&s;elves by jobs and contracts, and the groaning multitude bore the bur|then. What has England gained by war &s;ince the year 1738, only fifty years ago, to recompence her for two hundred millions &s;terling, incurred as a debt within that time, and under the annual intere&s;t of which, be|&s;ides what was incurred before, &s;he is now groaning? Nothing at all.</P>
<P>The glare of fancied glory has often been held up, and the &s;hadowy recompence im|po&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="7">it&s;elf upon the &s;en&s;es. Wars that might have been prevented have been madly gone into, and the end has been debt and di&s;content. A &s;ort of &s;omething which man cannot account for is mixed in his com|po&s;ition, and renders him the &s;ubject of de|ception by the very means he takes not to be deceived.</P>
<P>That jealou&s;y which the individuals of every nation feels at the &s;uppo&s;ed de&s;igns of foreign powers, fits them to be the prey of Mini&s;ters, and of tho&s;e among them&s;elves who&s;e trade is war, or who&s;e livelihood is jobs and contracts. <Q>Confu&s;ion to the politics of Europe, and may every nation be at war in &s;ix months,</Q> was a toa&s;t given in the hearing of the writer.&mdash; The man was in court to the Mini&s;try for a job.&mdash;Ye gentle Graces, if any &s;uch there be, who pre&s;ide over human actions, how mu&s;t ye weep at the viciou&s;ne&s;s of man.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider, for the feelings of Nature cannot be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, the calamities of war and the mi&s;eries it inflicts upon the human &s;pecies, the thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands of every age and &s;ex who are ren|dered
<PB N="5" REF="8">wretched by the event, &s;urely there is &s;omething in the heart of man that calls upon him to think! Surely there is &s;ome tender cord, tuned by the hand of its Creator, that &s;till &s;truggles to emit in the hearing of the &s;oul a note of &s;orrowing &s;ympathy. Let it then be heard, and let man learn to feel, that the true greatne&s;s of a nation is founded on principles of humanity; and that to avoid a war when her own exi&s;tence is not en|dangered, and wherein the happine&s;s of man mu&s;t be wantonly &s;acrificed, is a higher principle of true honour than madly to en|gage in it.</P>
<P>But independent of all civil and moral con&s;iderations, there is no po&s;&s;ible event that a war could produce either to England or France, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, that could in the mo&s;t di&s;tant proportion recom|pence to either, the expence &s;he mu&s;t be at. War involves in its progre&s;s &s;uch a train of unfor&s;een and un&s;uppo&s;ed circum&s;tances, &s;uch a combination of foreign matters, that no human wi&s;dom can calculate the end. It has but one thing certain, and that is increa&s;e of taxes. The policy of European Courts
<PB N="6" REF="9">is now &s;o ca&s;t, and their intere&s;t &s;o inter|woven with each other, that however ea&s;y it may be to begin a war, the weight and influence of interfering nations compel even the conqueror to unprofitable conditions of peace.</P>
<P>Commerce and maritime &s;trength are now becoming the fa&s;hion, or rather the rage of Europe, and this naturally excites in them a combined wi&s;h to prevent either England or France encrea&s;ing its comparative &s;trength by de&s;troying, or even relatively weakening the other, and therefore, whatever views each may have at the commencement of a war, new enemies will ari&s;e as either gains the advantage, and continual ob&s;tacles en|&s;ue to embarra&s;s &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The greatne&s;s of Lewis the Fourteenth made Europe his enemy, and the &s;ame cau&s;e will produce the &s;ame con&s;equence to any other European Power. That nation, therefore, only is truly wi&s;e, who contenting her&s;elf with the means of defence, creates to her&s;elf no unnece&s;&s;ary enemies by &s;eeking to be greater than the &s;y&s;tem of Europe ad|mits. The Monarch or the Mini&s;ter who
<PB N="7" REF="10">exceeds this line, knows but little of his bu&s;ine&s;s. It is what the poet on another occa&s;ion calls&mdash;</P>
<Q>The p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">int where &s;en&s;e and non&s;en&s;e join.</Q>
<P>Perhaps there is not a greater in&s;tance or the folly of calculating upon events, than are to be found in treaties of alliance. As &s;oon as they have an&s;wered the immediate purpo&s;e of either of the parties, they are but little regarded. Pretences, afterwards, are never wanting to explain them away, nor rea&s;ons to render them abortive. And if half the money which nations lavi&s;h on &s;peculative alliances were re&s;erved for their own immediate purpo&s;e, whenever the oc|ca&s;ion &s;hall arrive, it would be more pro|ductively and advantageou&s;ly employed.</P>
<P>Monarchs and Mini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ers, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or re&s;entment, often contemplate to them|&s;elves &s;chemes of future greatne&s;s, and &s;et out with what appears to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the faire&s;t pro&s;pect: In the mean while, the great wheel of time and fate revolves unob&s;erved, and &s;omething, never dreamed of, turns up and bla&s;ts the whole. A few fancied or un|profitable
<PB N="8" REF="11">laurels &s;upply the ab&s;ence of &s;uc|ce&s;s, and the exhau&s;ted nation is huzza'd into new Taxes.</P>
<P>The politics and intere&s;ts of European Courts are &s;o frequently varying with re|gard to each other, that there is no fixing even the probability of their future conduct. But the great principle of alliancing &s;eems to be but little under&s;tood or little cultivated in Courts, perhaps the lea&s;t of all in that of England.&mdash;No alliance can be operative, that does not embrace within it&s;elf, not only the attachment of the Sove|reigns, but the real intere&s;t of the nations.</P>
<P>The alliance between France and Spain, however it may be &s;poken of as a mere fa|mily compact, derives its greate&s;t &s;trength from national intere&s;t. The mines of Peru and Mexico are the Soul of this alliance. Were tho&s;e mines extinct, the family com|pact would mo&s;t probably di&s;&s;olve.</P>
<P>There exi&s;ts not a doubt in the mind of Spain, what part England would act, re|&s;pecting tho&s;e mines, could &s;he demoli&s;h the maritime power of France; and therefore the intere&s;t of Spain feels it&s;elf continually
<PB N="9" REF="12">united with France. Spain have high ideas of honour, but they have not the &s;ame ideas of Engli&s;h honour. They con&s;ider Eng|land as wholly governed by principles of intere&s;t, and that whatever &s;he thinks it her intere&s;t to do, and &s;uppo&s;es &s;he has the power of doing; &s;he makes very little cere|money of attempting. But this is not all&mdash; There is not a nation in Europe but what is more &s;atisfied that tho&s;e mines &s;hould be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Spain, than in that of any other European nation, becau&s;e the wealth of tho&s;e mines, &s;ufficient to ruin Europe in the hands of &s;ome of its powers, is innocently employed with re&s;pect to Eu|rope, and better and more peaceably di&s;tri|buted among them all, through the me|dium of Spain, than it would be through that of any other nation. This is one of the &s;ecret cau&s;es that combine &s;o large a part of Europe in the intere&s;t of France, becau&s;e they cannot but con&s;ider her as &s;tanding as a barrier to &s;ecure to them the free and equal di&s;tribution of this wealth throughout all the dominions of Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">This alliance of intere&s;t is likewi&s;e one of the un&s;een cements that prevents Spain and Portugal, two nations not very friendly to each other, proceeding to ho&s;tilities. They are both in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and whatever their di&s;likes may be, they can|not fail to con&s;ider, that by giving way to re&s;entment that would weaken and exhau&s;t them&s;elves, each would be expo&s;ed a prey to &s;ome &s;tronger power.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, this alliance of national intere&s;t is the only one that can be tru&s;ted, and the only one that can be operative. All other al|liances formed on the mere will and caprice of Sovereigns, or family connections, un|combined with national intere&s;ts, are but the quagmire of politics, and never fail to be|come a lo&s;s to that nation who wa&s;tes it pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;tance on the expectancy of di&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> returns.</P>
<P>With regard to Holland, a man mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> know very little of the matter, not to know that there exi&s;ts a &s;tronger principle of ri|val&s;hip between Holland and England i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> point of commerce, than prevails between England and France in point of power
<PB N="11" REF="14">and, therefore, whenever a Stadtholder of Holland &s;hall &s;ee it his intere&s;t to unite with the principle of his country, and act in con|cert with the &s;entiments of the very people who pay him for his &s;ervices, the means now taken by England to render him for|midable, will operate contrary to the politi|cal expectations of the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tances will produce their own na|tural effects, and no other, let the hopes or expectations of man be what they may. It is not our doing a thing with the de&s;ign that it &s;hall an&s;wer &s;uch or &s;uch an end, that will cau&s;e it to produce that end; the means taken mu&s;t have a natural ability and ten|dency within them&s;elves to produce no other, for it is this, and not our wi&s;hes or policy, that governs the event.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Navigation Act was levelled again&s;t the intere&s;t of the Dutch as a whole nation, and therefore it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the catching at the accidental circum|&s;tances of one man, as in the ca&s;e of the pre|&s;ent Stadtholder, can combine the intere&s;t of that country with this. A few years, perhaps a le&s;s time, may remove him to the
<PB N="12" REF="15">place where all things are forgotten, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, contemplating his father's troubles, will be naturally led to reprobate the means that produced them, and to repo&s;e him&s;elf on the intere&s;ts of his country, in preference to the accidental and tumultuous a&s;&s;i&s;tance of exterior power.</P>
<P>England her&s;elf exhibits at this day, a &s;pecies of this kind of policy. The pre&s;ent reign, by embracing the Scotch, has tran|quilized and conciliated the &s;pirit that di&s;|turbed the two former reigns. Accu&s;ations were not wanting at that time to reprobate the policy as tinctured with ingratitude to|wards tho&s;e who were the immediate means of the Hanover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The brilliant pen of Junius was drawn forth, but in vain. It enraptured without convincing; and tho' in the plenitude of its rage it might be &s;aid to give elegance to bitterne&s;s, yet the policy &s;urvived the bla&s;t.</P>
<P>What then will be the natural con&s;equence of this expence, on account of the Stadthol|der, or of a war entered into from that cau&s;e? Search the various windings and ca|verns of the human heart, and draw from
<PB N="13" REF="16">thence the mo&s;t probable conclu&s;ion, for this is more to be depended upon than the projects or declarations of Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>It may do very well for a paragraph in a news-paper, or the wild effu&s;ions of roman|tic politicians, or the mercenary views of tho&s;e who wi&s;h for war on any occa&s;ion, or on no occa&s;ion at all, but for the &s;ake of jobs and contracts, to talk of French fine&s;&s;e or French intrigue; but the Dutch are not a people to be impre&s;&s;ed by the fine&s;&s;e or in|trigue of France or England, or any other nation. If there has been any fine&s;&s;e in the ca&s;e, it has been between the Electorate of Hanover, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the Stadt|holder, in which it is mo&s;t probable the peo|ple of England will be fine&s;&s;ed out of a &s;um of money.</P>
<P>The Dutch, as is already ob&s;erved, are not a people open to the impre&s;&s;ion of fine&s;&s;e. It is lo&s;t upon them. They are impre&s;&s;ed by their commercial intere&s;t. It is the po|litical &s;oul of their country, the &s;pring of their actions, and when this principle coin|cides with their ideas of freedom, it has all
<PB N="14" REF="17">the impul&s;e a Dutchman is capable of feeling.</P>
<P>The Oppo&s;ition in Holland were the enemies of the Stadtholder, upon a convic|tion that he was not the friend of their na|tional intere&s;ts. They wanted no impul&s;e but this. Whether this defect in him pro|ceeded from foreign attachment, from bri|bery or corruption, or from the well-known defect of his under&s;tanding, is not the point of enquiry. It was the effect rather than the cau&s;e that irritated the Hollanders.</P>
<P>If the Stadtholder made u&s;e of the power he held in the government to expo&s;e and endanger the intere&s;ts and property of the very people who &s;upported him, what other incentive does any man in any country re|quire. If the Hollanders conceived the con|duct of the Stadtholder injurious to their national intere&s;t, they had the &s;ame right to expel him which England had to expel the Stuarts; and the interference of England to re-e&s;tabli&s;h him, &s;erves only to confirm in the Hollanders the &s;ame hatred again&s;t Eng|land which the attempt of Lewis the XIVth, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Stuarts cau&s;ed in England
<PB N="15" REF="18">again&s;t France; therefore, if the pre&s;ent po|licy is intended to attach Holland to Eng|land, it goes on a principle exceedingly erroneous.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider the &s;ituation of the Stadtholder, as making another part of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t place the cau&s;e of his troubles to &s;ome &s;ecret influence which governed his conduct during the late war, or in other words, that he was &s;u&s;pected of being the tool of the then Briti&s;h Admini&s;tration. Therefore, as every part of an argument ought to have its weight, in&s;tead of charg|ing the French of intriguing with the Hol|landers, the charge more con&s;i&s;tently lies again&s;t the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try, for intriguing with the Stadtholder, and endangering the nation in a war without a &s;ufficient object. That which the Mini&s;try are now doing con|firms the &s;u&s;picion, and explains to the Hol|landers that collu&s;ion of the Stadtholder again&s;t their national intere&s;ts, which he mu&s;t wi&s;h to have concealed, and the expla|nation does him more hurt than the unne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="16" REF="19">parade of &s;ervice has done him good.</P>
<P>Nothing but nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould have ope|rated with England to appear openly in a ca&s;e that mu&s;t put the Stadtholder on &s;till wor&s;e terms with his countrymen. Had France made any di&s;po&s;ition for war, had &s;he armed, had &s;he made any one ho&s;tile prepa|ration, there might then have been &s;ome pre|tence for England taking a &s;tep, that cannot fail to expo&s;e to the world that the &s;u&s;pi|cions of the Hollanders again&s;t the Stadt|holder were well founded, and that their cau&s;e was ju&s;t, however un&s;ucce&s;sful has been the event.</P>
<P>As to the con&s;equence of Holland in the &s;cale of Europe (the great &s;take, &s;ay &s;ome of the news-papers, for which England is con|tending) that is naturally pointed out by her condition: As merchants for other nations her intere&s;t dictates to her to be a neutral power, and this &s;he always will be unle&s;s &s;he is made war upon, as was the ca&s;e in the la&s;t war; and any expectation beyond what is the line of her intere&s;t, that is, beyond neutrality, either in England or France, will prove abor|tive.
<PB N="17" REF="20">It therefore cannot be policy to go to war to effect that at a great expence, which will naturally happen of it&s;elf, and beyond which there is nothing to expect.</P>
<P>Let Holland be allied with England or with France, or with neither, or with both, her national conduct, con&s;equently ari&s;ing out of her circum&s;tances, will be nearly the &s;ame, that is, &s;he will be neutral. Alliances have &s;uch a natural tendency to &s;ink into harmle&s;s unoperative things, that to make them a cau&s;e for going to war, either to prevent their being formed, or to break any already formed, is the &s;illie&s;t &s;pe|culation that war can be made upon, or wealth wa&s;ted to accompli&s;h. It would &s;carcely be worth the attempt, if war could be carried on without expence, becau&s;e almo&s;t the whole that can be hoped at the ri&s;k and expence of a war, is effected by their natural tendency to inactivity.</P>
<P>However pompous the declarations of an alliance may be, the object of many of them is no other than good-will and reciprocally &s;ecuring, as far as &s;uch &s;ecurity can go, that neither &s;hall join the enemies of the other in any war that may happen. But the na|tional
<PB N="18" REF="21">circum&s;tances of Holland, operate to en&s;ure this tranquility on her part as effec|tually to the power &s;he is not allied with, as the engagement it&s;elf does to the power with whom &s;he is allied; therefore the &s;ecurity from circum&s;tances is as good as the &s;ecu|rity from engagement.</P>
<P>As to a cordial union of intere&s;t between Holland and England, it is as unnatural to happen as between two individual rivals in the &s;ame trade: And if there is any &s;tep that England could take to put it at a &s;till greater di&s;tance, it is the part &s;he is now acting. She has increa&s;ed the animo&s;ity of Holland on the &s;peculative politics of inte|re&s;ting the Stadtholder, who&s;e future repo&s;e depends upon uniting with the Oppo&s;ition in Holland, as the pre&s;ent reign did with the Scotch. How fooli&s;h then has been the policy, how needle&s;s the expence, of endan|gering a war on account of the affairs of Holland.</P>
<P>A cordiality between England and France is le&s;s improbable than between England and Holland. It is not how an Engli&s;hman feels but how a Dutchman feels, that decides
<PB N="19" REF="22">this que&s;tion. Between England and France there is no real rival&s;hip of intere&s;t; it is more the effect of temper, di&s;po&s;ition, and the jealou&s;y of confiding in each other, than any &s;ub&s;tantial cau&s;e, that keeps up the animo&s;ity. But on the part of Holland towards England, there is over and above the &s;pirit of animo&s;ity, the more powerful mo|tives of intere&s;ted commercial rival&s;hip, and the galling remembrance of pa&s;t injuries. The making war upon them under Lord North's admini&s;tration, when they were taking no part in the ho&s;tilities, but merely acting the bu&s;ine&s;s of merchants, is a cir|cum&s;tance that will not ea&s;ily be forgotten by them. On the&s;e rea&s;ons, therefore, which are naturally deduced from the ope|rative feelings of mankind, any expectation of attaching Holland to England as a friendly power, is vague and futile. Nature has her own way of working in the heart, and all plans of politics not founded thereon will di&s;appoint them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Any one who will review the hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h politics for &s;everal years pa&s;t, mu&s;t perceive that they have been directed with|out
<PB N="20" REF="23">&s;y&s;tem. To e&s;tabli&s;h this, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to examine one circum&s;tance fre&s;h in the mind of every man.</P>
<P>The American war was pro&s;ecuted at a very great expence, on the publicly declared opinion, that the retaining America was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of England; but America being now &s;eparated from England, the pre&s;ent politics are, that &s;he is better without her than with her. Both the&s;e cannot be true, and their contradiction to each other &s;hews a want of &s;y&s;tem. If the latter is true, it amounts to an impeachment of the political judgment of Government, becau&s;e the di&s;covery ought to have been made before the expence was gone into. This &s;ingle circum&s;tance, yet fre&s;h in every man's mind, is &s;ufficient to create a &s;u&s;pi|cion, whether the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures are more wi&s;ely founded than the former ones; and whether experience may not prove, that going to war for the &s;ake of the Stadtholder, or for the hope of retaining a partial intere&s;t in Holland, who, under any connection can. from circum&s;tances, be no more than a neu|tral
<PB N="21" REF="24">power, is not as weak policy as going to war to retain America.</P>
<P>If England is powerful enough to main|tain her own ground and con&s;equence in the world as an independent nation, &s;he needs no foreign connection. If &s;he is not, the fact contradicts the popular opinion that &s;he is. Therefore, either her politics are wrong, or her true condition is not what &s;he &s;up|po&s;es it to be. Either &s;he mu&s;t give up her opinion to ju&s;tify her politics, or renounce her politics to vindicate her opinion.</P>
<P>If &s;ome kind of connection with Holland is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an object worthy &s;ome ex|pence to obtain, it may be a&s;ked why was that connection broken by making war upon her in the la&s;t war. If it was not then worth pre&s;erving without expence, is it now worth re-obtaining at a va&s;t expence? If the Hol|landers do not like the Engli&s;h, can they be made to like them again&s;t their wills? If it &s;hall be &s;aid that under the former connec|tion they were unfriendly, will they be more friendly under any other? They were then in as free a &s;ituation to chu&s;e as any fu|ture circum&s;tances can make them, and,
<PB N="22" REF="25">therefore, the national governing &s;entiment of the country can be ea&s;ily di&s;covered, for it &s;ignifies not what or who a Stadtholder may be, that which governs Holland is, and al|ways mu&s;t be, a commercial principle, and it will follow this line in &s;pite of politics. In|tere&s;t is as predominant and as &s;ilent in its ope|rations as love; it re&s;i&s;ts all the attempts of force, and countermines all the &s;tratagem of controul.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t able Engli&s;h State&s;men and Politicians have always held it as a principle, that foreign connections &s;erved only to em|barra&s;s and exhau&s;t England. That, &s;urround|ed by the ocean, &s;he could not be invaded as countries are on the Continent of Europe, and that her in&s;ular &s;ituation dictated to her a different &s;y&s;tem of politics to what tho&s;e countries required, and that to be enleagued with them was &s;acri&s;icing the advantages of &s;ituation to a capricious &s;y&s;tem of politics. That tho' &s;he might &s;erve them, they could not much &s;erve her, and that as the &s;ervice mu&s;t at all times be paid for, it could always be procured when it was wanted; and that it would be better to take it up in this line
<PB N="23" REF="26">than to embarra&s;s her&s;elf with &s;peculative alliances that &s;erved rather to draw her into a Continental war on their account, than extricate her from a war undertaken on her own account.</P>
<P>From this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the affairs of Hol|land, and of the inadequacy of Holland as an object for war, we will proceed to &s;hew that neither England nor France are in a condition to go to war, and that there is no pre&s;ent object to the one or the other to recompence the expence that each mu&s;t be at, or atone to the &s;ubjects of either for the additional burthens that mu&s;t be brought upon them. I defend the cau&s;e of the poor, of the manufactures, of the trade&s;man, of the farmer, and of all tho&s;e on whom the real burthen of taxes fall&mdash;but above all, I defend the cau&s;e of humanity.</P>
<P>It will always happen, that any rumour of war will be popular among a great num|ber of people in London. There are thou|&s;ands who live by it; it is their harve&s;t; and the clamour which tho&s;e people keep up in news-papers and conver&s;ations, pa&s;&s;es un&s;u&s;piciou&s;ly for the voice of the people,
<PB N="24" REF="27">and it is not till after the mi&s;chief is done, that the deception is di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Such people are continually holding up in very magnified terms the wealth of the nation, and the depre&s;&s;ed condition of France, as rea&s;ons for commencing a war, without knowing any thing of either of the&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>But admitting them to be as true, as they are fal&s;e, as will be hereafter &s;hewn, it cer|tainly indicates a vilene&s;s in the national di&s;po&s;ition of any country, that will make the accidental internal difficulties to which all nations are &s;ubject, and &s;ometimes en|cumbered with, a rea&s;on for making war upon them. The amazing encrea&s;e and magnitude of the paper currency now float|ing in all parts of England, expo&s;es her to a &s;hock as much more tremendous than the &s;hock occa&s;ioned by the bankruptcy of the South Sea funds, as the quantity of credit and paper currency is now greater than they were at that time. Whenever &s;uch a cir|cum&s;tance &s;hall happen, and the wi&s;e&s;t men in the nation are, and cannot avoid being, impre&s;&s;ed with the danger, it would be looked upon a ba&s;ene&s;s in France to make
<PB N="25" REF="28">the di&s;tre&s;s and misfortune of England a cau&s;e and an opportunity for making war upon her, yet this hedious infidelity is publicly avowed in England. The bank|ruptcy of 1719, was precipitated by the great credit which the funds then had, and the confidence which people placed in them. Is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot credit making infinitely greater &s;trides now than it made then? Is not confidence equally as blind now as at that day? The people then &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves as wi&s;e as they do now, yet they were mi&s;erably de|ceived, and the deception that has once hap|pened will happen again from the &s;ame cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Credit is not money, and therefore it is not pay, neither can it be put in the place of money in the end. It is only the means of getting into debt, not the means of get|ting out, otherwi&s;e the national debt could not accumulate; and the delu&s;ion which nations are under re&s;pecting the extention of credit is exactly like that which every man feels re&s;pecting life, the end is always nearer than was expected; and we become bank|rupts
<PB N="26" REF="29">in time by the &s;ame delu&s;ion that na|tions become bankrupts in property.</P>
<P>The little which nations know, or are &s;ome times willing to know, of each other, &s;erves to precipitate them into wars which neither would have undertaken, had &s;he fully known the extent of the power and circum&s;tances of the other; it may there|fore be of &s;ome u&s;e to place the circum|&s;tances of England and France in a compa|rative point of view.</P>
<P>In order to do this the accidental circum|&s;tances of a nation mu&s;t be thrown out of the account. By accidental circum&s;tances is meant, tho&s;e temporary disjointings and de|rangements of its internal &s;y&s;tem which every nation in the world is &s;ubject to, and which, like accidental fits of &s;ickne&s;s in the human body, prevents in the interim the full exertion and exerci&s;e of its natural powers.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tantial ba&s;is of the power of a nation ari&s;es out of its population, its wealth and its revenues. To the&s;e may be added the di&s;po&s;ition of the people. Each of the&s;e will be &s;poken to as we proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="30">In&s;tances are not wanting to &s;hew that a nation confiding too much on its natural &s;trength, is le&s;s inclined to be active in its operations than one of le&s;s natural powers who is obliged to &s;upply that deficiency by encrea&s;ing its exertions. This has often been the ca&s;e between England and France. The activity of England ari&s;ing from its fears, has &s;ometimes exceeded the exertions of France repo&s;ing on its confidence.</P>
<P>But as this depends on the accidental di&s;|po&s;ition of a people, it will not always be the &s;ame. It is a matter well known to every man who has lately been in France, that a very extraordinary change is working it&s;elf in the minds of the people of that na|tion. A &s;pirit that will render France ex|ceedingly formidable whenever its govern|ment &s;hall embrace the fortunate opportu|nity of doubling its &s;trength by allying, if it may be &s;o expre&s;&s;ed, (for it is difficult to expre&s;s a new idea by old terms) the Ma|je&s;ty of the Sovereign with the Maje&s;ty of the nation; for of all alliances this is infi|nitely the &s;tronge&s;t and the &s;afe&s;t to be tru&s;ted to, becau&s;e the intere&s;t &s;o formed,
<PB N="28" REF="31">and operating again&s;t external enemies can never be divided.</P>
<P>It may be taken as a certain rule, that a &s;ubject of any country attached to the go|vernment on the principles above-mentioned is of twice the value he was before. Free|dom in the &s;ubject is not a diminution, as was formerly believed, of the power of go|vernment, but an increa&s;e of it. Yet the progre&s;s by which changes of this kind are effected, requires to be nicely attended to.</P>
<P>Were governments to offer freedom to the people, or to &s;hew an anxiety for that pur|po&s;e, the offer mo&s;t probably would be re|jected. The purpo&s;e for which it was of|fered, might be mi&s;tru&s;ted. Therefore the de&s;ire mu&s;t originate with, and proceed from the ma&s;s of the people, and when the im|pre&s;&s;ion becomes univer&s;al, and not before, is the important moment for the mo&s;t ef|fectual con&s;olidation of national &s;trength and greatne&s;s that can take place.</P>
<P>While this change is working, there will appear a kind of chaos on the nation; but the creation we enjoy aro&s;e out of a chaos,
<PB N="29" REF="32">and our greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings appear to have a confu&s;ed beginning.</P>
<P>Therefore, we may take it for granted, that what has at this moment the appear|ance of di&s;order in France, is no more than one of the natural links in that great chain of circum&s;tances by which nations acquire the &s;ummit of their greatne&s;s. The Pro|vincial A&s;&s;emblies already began in France, are as full, or rather a fuller repre&s;entation of the people than the Parliaments of Eng|land are.</P>
<P>The French, or, as they were formerly called, the Franks, (from whence came the Engli&s;h word Frank and Free) were once the free&s;t people in Europe; and as nations appear to have their periodical revolutions, it is very probable they will be &s;o again. The charge is already began. The people of France, as is before ob&s;erved, are begin|ing to think for them&s;elves, and the people of England re&s;igning up the prerogative of thinking.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now proceed to compare the pre|&s;ent condition of England and France as to population revenues and wealth, and to &s;hew
<PB N="30" REF="33">that neither is in a condition of going to war, and that war can end in nothing but lo&s;s, and, mo&s;t probably, a temporary ruin to both nations.</P>
<P>To e&s;tabli&s;h this point &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for both nations to be impre&s;&s;ed with, a free inve&s;tigation of all the matters connected with it is indi&s;pen&s;ible: If, therefore, any thing herein advanced &s;hall be di&s;agreeable, it mu&s;t be ju&s;tified on the ground that it is better to be known in order to prevent ruin, than to be concealed, when &s;uch con|cealment &s;erves only to ha&s;ten the ruin on.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>OF POPULATION.</HEAD>
<P>The Population of France being upwards of twenty-four millions, is more than double that of Great Britain and Ireland; be&s;ides which France recruits more &s;oldiers in Swi&s;&s;erland than England does in Scot|land and Ireland. To this may likewi&s;e be added, that England and Ireland are not on the be&s;t terms. The &s;u&s;picion that Eng|land governs Ireland for the purpo&s;e of keep|ing her low to prevent her becoming a rival in trade and manufactures, will always ope|rate
<PB N="31" REF="34">to hold Ireland in a &s;tate of &s;entimental ho&s;tilities with England.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>REVENUES.</HEAD>
<P>The Revenues of France are twenty-four millions &s;terling. The Revenues of Eng|land fifteen millions and an half. The taxes per head in France are twenty &s;hillings &s;terling; the taxes per head in England are two pounds four &s;hillings and two pence. The national debt in France including the life annuities (which are two-fifths of the whole debt, and are annually expiring) at eleven years purcha&s;e, is one hundred and forty-two millions &s;terling. The national debt of England, the whole of which is on perpetual intere&s;t, is two hundred and forty-five millions. The national debt of France contains a power of annihi|lating it&s;elf without any new taxes for that purpo&s;e; becau&s;e it needs no more than to apply the life annuities as they expire to the purcha&s;e of the other three-fifths, which are on perpetual intere&s;t: But the national debt of England has not this advantage, and therefore the million a year that is to be
<PB N="32" REF="35">towards reducing it is &s;o much addi|tional tax upon the people, over and above the current &s;ervice.</P>

<HEAD>WEALTH.</HEAD>
<P>This is an important inve&s;tigation, it ought therefore to be heard with patience, and judged of without prejudice.</P>
<P>Nothing is more common than for people to mi&s;take one thing for another. Do not tho&s;e who are crying up the wealth of the nation, mi&s;take a paper currency for riches? To a&s;certain this point may be one of the means of preventing that ruin which cannot fail to follow by per&s;i&s;ting in the mi&s;take.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t e&s;timation that is made of the quantity of gold and &s;ilver in Britain at this pre&s;ent day is twenty millions: and tho&s;e who are mo&s;t conver&s;ant with money tran&s;actions, believe it to be con&s;iderably below that &s;um. Yet this is no more money than what the nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed twenty years ago, and therefore, whatever her trade may be, it has produced to her no profit. Certainly no man can be &s;o unwi&s;e
<PB N="33" REF="36">as to &s;uppo&s;e that encrea&s;ing the quantity of bank notes, which is done with as little trouble as printing of news-papers, is na|national wealth.</P>
<P>The quantity of money in the nation was very well a&s;certained in the years 1773, 74, and 76, by calling in the light gold coin.</P>
<P>There were upwards of fifteen millions and a half of gold coin then called in, which, with upwards of two millions of heavy gui|neas that remained out, and the &s;ilver coin, made above twenty millions, which is more than there is at this day. There is an amazing increa&s;e in the circulation of Bank paper, which is no more national wealth than news-papers are; becau&s;e an increa&s;e of promi&s;&s;ary notes, the capital remaining unin|crea&s;ed, or not increa&s;ing in the &s;ame propor|tion, is no increa&s;e of wealth. It &s;erves to rai&s;e fal&s;e ideas which the judicious &s;oon di&s;cover, and the ignorant experience to their co&s;t.</P>
<P>Out of twenty miilions &s;terling, the pre|&s;ent quantity of real money in the nation, it would be too great an allowance to &s;ay
<PB N="34" REF="37">that one fourth of that &s;um, which is five millions, was in London. But even admitting this to be the ca&s;e, it would require no very conjuring powers to a&s;certain pretty nearly what proportion of that &s;um of five millions could be in the Bank. It would be ridi|culous to &s;uppo&s;e it could be le&s;s than half a million, and extravagant to &s;uppo&s;e it could be two millions.</P>
<P>It likewi&s;e requires no very extraordinary di&s;cernment to a&s;certain how immen&s;e the quantity of Bank Notes, compared to its ca|pital in the Bank mu&s;t be, when it is con|&s;idered, that the national taxes are paid in Bank Notes, that all great tran&s;actions are done in Bank Notes, and that were a loan for twenty millions to be opened at the meet-of Parliament, it would mo&s;t probably be &s;ub&s;cribed in a few days: Yet all men mu&s;t know the loan could not be paid in money, becau&s;e it is at lea&s;t four times greater than all the money in London, including the Bankers and the Bank amount too. In &s;hort, every thing &s;hows that the rage that over|run America, for paper money, or paper cur|rency, has reached to England under another
<PB N="35" REF="38">name. There it was called Continental Money, and here it is called Bank Notes. But it &s;ignifies not what name it bears, if the capital is not equal to the redemption.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e another circum&s;tance that cannot fail to &s;trike with &s;ome force when it is mentioned, becau&s;e every man that has any thing to do with money tran&s;|actions, will feel the truth of it, tho' he may not before have reflected upon it. It is the embarra&s;&s;ed condition into which the gold coin is thrown by the nece&s;&s;ity of weighing it, and by refu&s;ing guineas that are even &s;tanding weight, and there appears to be but few heavy ones. Whether this is intended to force the Paper Currency into circulation, is not here attempted to be a&s;&s;erted, but it certainly has that effect to a very great de|gree, becau&s;e people, rather than &s;ubmit to the trouble and hazard of weighing, will take paper in preference to money. This was once the ca&s;e in America.</P>
<P>The natural effect of encrea&s;ing and con|tinuing to increa&s;e paper currencies is that of bani&s;hing the real money. The &s;hadow
<PB N="36" REF="39">takes place of the &s;ub&s;tance till the country is left with only &s;hadows in its hands.</P>
<P>A trade that does not increa&s;e the quan|tity of real money in a country, cannot be &s;tiled a profitable trade; yet this is certainly the ca&s;e with England: and as to credit, of which &s;o much has been &s;aid, it may be founded on ignorance or a fal&s;e belief, as well as on real ability.</P>
<P>In Am&s;terdam, the money depo&s;ited in the Bank is never taken out again. The de|po&s;itors, when they have debts to pay, tran&s;|fer their right to the per&s;ons to whom they are indebted, and tho&s;e again proceed by the &s;ame practice, and the transfer of the right goes for payment; now could all the money dopo&s;ited in the Bank of Am&s;terdam be pri|vately removed away, and the matter be kept a &s;ecret, the ignorance, or the belief that the money was &s;till there, would give the &s;ame credit as if it had not been removed. In &s;hort, credit is often no more than an opi|nion, and the difference between credit and money is that money requires no opinion to &s;upport it.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="40">All the countries in Europe annually in|crea&s;e in their quantity of gold and &s;ilver ex|cept England. By the regi&s;ters kept at Li&s;|bon and Cadiz, the two ports into which the gold and &s;ilver from South America are imported, it appears that above eighty mil|lions &s;terling have been imported within twenty years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From 1763 to 1777, a period of fifteen years of peace, the regi&s;tered importations of gold and &s;ilver into Li&s;bon and Cadiz, was &s;eventy millions &s;terling, be&s;ides what was pri|vately landed.</NOTE>.

<P>In what is the profits of trade to &s;hew it|&s;elf but by increa&s;ing the quantity of that
<PB N="38" REF="41">which is the object of trade, money. An increa&s;e of paper is not an increa&s;e of na|tional profit any more than it is an increa&s;e of national money, and the confounding paper and money together, or not attending to the di&s;tinction, is a rock that the nation will one day &s;plit upon.</P>
<P>Whether the payment of intere&s;t to fo|reigners, or the trade to the Ea&s;t-Indies, or the nation embroiling it&s;elf in foreign wars, or whether the amount of all the trade which England carries on with different parts of the world, collectively taken, balances it&s;elf without profit; whether one or all of the&s;e is the cau&s;e, why the quantity of money does not encrea&s;e in England is not, in this place, the object of enquiry. It is the fact and not the cau&s;e that is the matter here treated of.</P>
<P>Men immer&s;ed in trade and the concerns of a counting hou&s;e, are not the mo&s;t &s;pecu|lative in national affairs, or always the be&s;t judges of them. Accu&s;tomed to run ri&s;ks in trade, they are habitually prepared to run ri&s;ks with Government, and tho' they
<PB N="39" REF="42">are the fir&s;t to &s;uffer, they are often the la&s;t to fore&s;ee an evil.</P>
<P>Let us now ca&s;t a look towards the ma|nufactures. A great deal has been &s;aid of their flouri&s;hing condition, and perhaps a great deal too much, for it may again be a&s;ked, where is the profit if there is no en|crea&s;e of money in the nation.</P>
<P>The woollen manufacture is the &s;taple manufacture of England, and this is ev|dently on the decline, in &s;ome, if not in all, its branches. The city of Norwich, one of the mo&s;t populous cities in England, and wholly dependant on the woollen manufac|ture, is, at this day in a very impoveri&s;hed condition, owing to the decline of its trade.</P>
<P>But not to re&s;t the matter on a general a&s;&s;ertion, or embarra&s;s it with numerous &s;tatements, we will produce a circum&s;tance by which the whole progre&s;s of the trade may be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>So long as thirty years ago the price paid to the &s;pinners of wool was one &s;hilling for twenty-four &s;kains, each &s;kain containing five hundred and &s;ixty yards. This, according to the term of the trade, was called giving a
<PB N="40" REF="43">&s;hilling for a &s;hilling. A good hand would &s;pin twelve &s;kains, which was &s;ixpence a day.</P>
<P>According to the increa&s;e of taxes, and the increa&s;ed price of all the articles of life, they certainly ought now to get at lea&s;t fif|teen pence, for what thirty years ago they got a &s;hilling for. But &s;uch is the decline of the trade, that the ca&s;e is directly the contrary. They now get but ninepence for the &s;hilling, that is, they get but nine pence for what thirty years ago they got a &s;hilling for. Can the&s;e people cry out for war, when they are already half ruined by the decline of trade, and half devoured by the encrea&s;e of taxes.</P>
<P>But this is not the whole of the misfortunes which that part of the country &s;uffers, and which will extend to others. The Norfolk farmers were the fir&s;t who went into the practice of manuring their land with marle: But time has &s;hewn, that though it gave a vigour to the land for &s;ome years, it operated in the end to exhau&s;t its &s;tamina; that the lands in many parts are wor&s;e than before they began to marle, and that it will not an|&s;wer to marle a &s;econd time.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="44">The manufactures of Manche&s;ter, Bir|mingham and Sheffield have had of late a con&s;iderable &s;pring, but this appears to be rather on &s;peculation than certainty. The &s;peculations on the American market have failed, and that on Ru&s;&s;ia is becoming very precarious. Experience likewi&s;e was want|ing to a&s;certain the quantity which the treaty of commerce with France would give &s;ale to, and it is mo&s;t probable the e&s;timations have been too high, more e&s;pecially as Eng|li&s;h goods will now become unpopular in France, which was not the ca&s;e before the pre&s;ent injudicius rupture.</P>
<P>But in the be&s;t &s;tate which manufactures can be in, they are very un&s;table &s;ources of national wealth. The rea&s;ons are, that they &s;eldom continue long in one &s;tay. The market for them depends upon the caprice of fa&s;hions, and &s;ometimes of politics in foreign countries, and they are at all times expo&s;ed to rival&s;hip as well as to change. The Americans have already &s;everal manu|factures among them, which they prefer to the Engli&s;h, &s;uch as axes, &s;cythes, &s;ickles, houghs, planes, nails, &amp;c. Window gla&s;s,
<PB N="42" REF="45">which was once a con&s;iderable article of export from England to America, the Americans now procure from other countries, nearly as good as the Engli&s;h Crown gla&s;s, and but little dearer than the common green window gla&s;s.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat remarkable that &s;o many pens have been di&s;played to &s;hew, what is called the increa&s;e of the commerce of Eng|land, and yet all of them have &s;topt &s;hort of the grand point, that is, they have gone no farther than to &s;hew that a larger num|ber of &s;hipping, and a greater quantity of tonnage have been employed of late years than formerly: But this is no more than what is happening in other parts of Europe. The pre&s;ent fa&s;hion of the world is com|merce, and the quantity encrea&s;es in France as well as in England.</P>
<P>But the object of all trade is profit, and profit &s;hews it&s;elf, not by an increa&s;e of paper currency, for that may be nationally had without the trouble of trade, but by an in|crea&s;e of real money: therefore the e&s;timation &s;hould have ended, not in the comparative quantity of &s;hipping and tonnage, but in
<PB N="43" REF="46">the comparative quantity of gold and &s;il|ver.</P>
<P>Had the quantity of gold and &s;ilver in|crea&s;ed in England, the mini&s;terial writers would not have &s;topt &s;hort at &s;hipping and tonnage; but if they know any thing of the matter, they mu&s;t know that it does not increa&s;e, and that the deception is occa&s;ion|ed by the increa&s;e of paper in&s;tead of money, and that as paper continue to increa&s;e, gold and &s;ilver will dimini&s;h. Poorer in wealth and richer in delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Something is radically wrong, and time will di&s;cover it to be putting paper in the room of money.</P>
<P>Out of one hundred millions &s;terling of gold and &s;ilver, which mu&s;t have been im|ported into Europe from South America &s;ince the commencement of the peace before la&s;t, it does not appear that England has de|rived or retains any portion of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Neckar &s;tates the annual increa&s;e of gold and &s;ilver in France, that is, the proportion which France draws of the annual importa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion in to Europe, to be upwards of one million <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">terling: But England, in the &s;pace of twenty
<PB N="44" REF="47">years, do not appear to have encrea&s;od in any thing but paper currency.</P>
<P>Credulity is wealth while credulity la&s;ts, and credit is, in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, the child of credulity. It requires no more faith to believe paper to be money, than to believe a man could go into a quart bottle; and the nation who&s;e credulity can be impo&s;ed upon by bottle conjuring, can, for a time, be im|po&s;ed upon by paper conjuring.</P>
<P>From the&s;e matters we pa&s;s on to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the national debt, which is another &s;pecies of paper currency.</P>
<P>In &s;hort to whatever point the eye is di|rected, whether to the money, the paper, the manufactures, the taxes, or the debt, the in|ability of &s;upporting a war is evident, unle&s;s it is intended to carry it on by fleecing the &s;kin over peoples ears by taxes; and there|fore the endangering the nation in a war for the &s;ake of the Stadtholder of Holland, or the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, or any other foreign af|fairs, from which England can derive no po&s;&s;ible advantage, is an ab&s;urd and ruinous &s;y&s;tem of politics.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="48">France perhaps is not in a better &s;ituation, and, therefore, a war where both mu&s;t lo&s;e, and wherein they could only act the part of &s;econds, mu&s;t hi&s;torically have been deno|minated a boyi&s;h, fooli&s;h, unnece&s;&s;ary quarrel.</P>
<P>But before we enter on the &s;ubject of the national debt, it will be proper to take a general review of the different manner of carrying on war &s;ince the Revolution to what was the practice before.</P>
<P>Before the Revolution the intervals of peace and war always found means to pay off the expence, and leave the nation clear of incumbrance at the commencement of any &s;ucceeding war; and even for &s;ome years after the Revolution this practice was continued.</P>
<P>From the year 1688, (the aera of the Revo|lution) to the year 1702, a period of fourteen years, the &s;ums borrowed by Government at different times, amounted to forty-four mil|lions; yet this &s;um was paid off almo&s;t as fa&s;t as it was borrowed: thirty-four mil|lions being paid off, at the commencement of the year 1702. This was a greater exer|tion
<PB N="46" REF="49">than the nation has ever made &s;ince, for exertion is not in borrowing but in paying.</P>
<P>From that time wars have been carried on by borrowing and funding the capital on a perpetual intere&s;t, in&s;tead of paying it off, and thereby continually carrying forward and accumulating the weight and expence of every war into the next. By this means that which was light at fir&s;t, becomes im|men&s;ely heavy at la&s;t. The nation has now on its &s;houlders the weight of all the wars from the time of Queen Anne. This practice is exactly like that of loading a hor&s;e with a feather at a time till you break his back.</P>
<P>The national debt exhibits at this day a &s;triking novelty. It has travelled on in a cir|cular progre&s;&s;ion till the amount of the annual intere&s;t has exactly overtaken, or be|come equal to, the fir&s;t capital of the na|tional debt, NINE MILLIONS. Here begins the evidence of the predictions &s;o long fore|told by the able&s;t calculators in the nation. The intere&s;t will in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion overtake all the &s;ucceeding capitals, and that with the proportioned rapidity with which tho&s;e ca|pitals
<PB N="47" REF="50">accumulated; becau&s;e by continuing the practice, not only higher and higher pre|miums mu&s;t be given for loans, but the money, or rather the paper, will not go &s;o far as it formerly did, and therefore the debt will encrea&s;e with a continually encrea&s;ing velocity.</P>
<P>The expence of every war, &s;ince the na|tional debt began, has, upon an average, been double the expence of the war preceeding it: the expence therefore of the next war will be at lea&s;t two hundred millions, which will encrea&s;e the annual intere&s;t to at lea&s;t &s;even|teen millions, and con&s;equently the taxes in the &s;ame proportion; the following war will encrea&s;e the intere&s;t to thirty-three millions, and a third war will mount up the intere&s;t to &s;ixty-five millions. This is not going on in the &s;pirit of prediction, but taking what has already been as a rule for what will yet be, and therefore the nation has but a mi&s;erable pro&s;pect to look at. The weight of accu|mulating intere&s;t is not much felt till after many years have pa&s;&s;ed over; but when it begins to be heavy, as it does now, the bur|then encrea&s;es like that of purcha&s;ing a hor&s;e
<PB N="48" REF="51">with a farthing for the fir&s;t nail of the &s;hoe and doubling it.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Pitt's &s;cheme of reducing the national debt by a million a year, applied to the purcha&s;e of &s;tock, it will turn out, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it, a ridiculous and frivolous project: For if a Mini&s;ter has not experience enough to di&s;tingui&s;h a feather in the air, and &s;uch there always will be, from the God of War, nor the clamours and in|tere&s;t of tho&s;e who are &s;eeking for jobs and contracts, from the voice and intere&s;t of the people, he will &s;oon precipitate the nation into &s;ome unnece&s;&s;ary war: and therefore, any &s;cheme of redemption of the debt, founded on the &s;uppo&s;ed continuance of peace, will, with &s;uch conduct, be no more than a balloon.</P>
<P>That the funding &s;y&s;tem contains within it&s;elf the &s;eeds of its own de&s;truction, is as certain as that of the human body contain|ing within it&s;elf the &s;eeds of death. The event is as fixed as fate, unle&s;s it cannot be taken as a proof that becau&s;e we are not dead we are not to die.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="52">The con&s;equence of the funding &s;cheme, even if no other event takes place, will be to create two violent parties in the nation. The one goaded by taxes continually encrea&s;|ing to pay the intere&s;t, the other reaping a benefit from the taxes by receiving the inte|re&s;t. This is very &s;trongly &s;hadowed forth, like the hand-writing on the wall, by the in|genious author of the Commercial Atlas, in his ob&s;ervations on the national debt.</P>
<P>The &s;lumber that for &s;everal years has over-&s;hadowed the nation in all matters of public finance, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to la&s;t for ever. The people have not yet awakened to the &s;ubject, and this is taken for granted they never will. But, if a &s;uppo&s;ed unne|ce&s;&s;ary expenditure of between five and &s;ix millions &s;terling in the finances of France, (for the writer undertakes not to judge of the fact) has awakened that whole nation, a people &s;uppo&s;ed to be perfectly docile in all national matters, &s;urely the people of Eng|land will not be le&s;s attentive to their rights and properties. If this &s;hould not be the ca&s;e, the inference will be fairly drawn, that England is lo&s;ing the &s;pirit that France is
<PB N="50" REF="53">taking up, and that it is an ingenious device in the Mini&s;try to compo&s;e the nation to un|popular and unnece&s;&s;ary taxes, by &s;hamming a victory when there was no enemy at hand.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, every war &s;erves to encrea&s;e every kind of paper currency in the nation, and to dimini&s;h the quantity of gold and &s;ilver, by &s;ending it to Pru&s;&s;ia and other foreign countries.</P>
<P>It will not be denied that credulity is a &s;trong trait in the Engli&s;h character; and this has in no in&s;tance &s;hewn it&s;elf more than in mi&s;taking paper for money, except it be in the unaccountable ignorance of mi&s;taking the debt of the nation for riches. But the &s;u&s;picion is beginning to awake.</P>
<P>We will clo&s;e this article with ob&s;erving that a new kind of paper currency has aro&s;e within a few years, which is that of country Bank Notes; almo&s;t every town now has its Bank, its Paper Mint, and the coinage of paper is become univer&s;al. In the mean time the melting down the light guineas, and recoining them, pa&s;&s;es with tho&s;e who know no better for an encrea&s;e of money; becau&s;e every new guinea they &s;ee, and
<PB N="51" REF="54">which is but &s;eldom, they naturally &s;uppo&s;e to be a guinea more, when it is really nothing el&s;e than an old guinea new ca&s;t.</P>
<P>From this account of the money, paper, and national debt of England, we proceed to compare it with the money, paper, and na|tional debt of France.</P>
<P>It is very well known that paper has not the credit in France which it has in Eng|land, and that, con&s;equently there is much le&s;s of it. This has naturally operated to en|crea&s;e the quantity of gold and &s;ilver in France, and prevent the encrea&s;e of paper.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t e&s;timation of the quantity of gold and &s;ilver in England, as already &s;tated, is twenty millions &s;terling, and the quantity of paper grafted thereon, immen&s;e.</P>
<P>The quantity of gold and &s;ilver in France, is upwards of ninety millions &s;terling, and the quantity of paper grafted thereon, trifling. France, therefore, has a long run of credit yet in re&s;erve, which England has already expended; and it will naturally follow, that when the Government of France and the nation &s;hall adju&s;t their differences by an amicable embrace of each other, that this
<PB N="52" REF="55">re&s;erved credit will be brought forth, and the power of France will be at lea&s;t doubly encrea&s;ed. The adju&s;tment of the&s;e diffe|rences is but the bu&s;ine&s;s of a day, whenever its government &s;hall &s;ee the proper moment for doing it, and nothing would precipitate this event more than a war. The cry of war, from the injudicious provocations given by the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try, and the di&s;advanta|geous effect of the Commercial, Treaty, is becoming popular in France.</P>
<P>The near &s;ituation of France to Spain and Portugal, the two countries which import gold and &s;ilver, and her manufactures being better adapted to the warm climate of the&s;e countries, than the manufactures of Eng|land, give her &s;uperior opportunities of drawing money into the nation, and as &s;he has but little trade to the Ea&s;t Indies, the money &s;o drawn in is not drawn out again as in England. Another advantage is, that from the greatne&s;s of her dominions &s;he has no occa&s;ion to wa&s;te her wealth in hiring foreign troops, as is the practice with Eng|land; and a third advantage is, that the money which England &s;quanders in Pru&s;&s;ia
<PB N="53" REF="56">and other countries on the Continent &s;erves to encrea&s;e the wealth of France, becau&s;e a con&s;iderable part of it centers there through the medium of her commerce.</P>
<P>Admitting Great Gritain and Ireland to contain ten millions of inhabitants, the quan|tity of money per head is forty &s;hillings; the money per head in France is three pounds fifteen &s;hillings, which is nearly double.</P>
<P>The national debt of England, compared to the whole amount of money in the na|tion, is as twelve is to one, that is, the debt is twelve times greater than all the money amounts to.</P>
<P>The national debt of France, compared to the whole amount of her money, is con&s;ider|ably le&s;s than as two is to one, that is, her debt is not &s;o much as twice the amount of her money. France, therefore, as already &s;tated, has an immen&s;e credit in re&s;erve whenever the &s;ettlement of her pre&s;ent internal differ|ences &s;hall furni&s;h her with the means of employing it, and that period, &s;o much to be dreaded by England, is ha&s;tening on.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="57">The annual intere&s;t of the national debt of England and France are nearly equal, be|ing NINE MILLIONS &s;terling; but with this difference, that above three millions and a half of the annual intere&s;t of France are only life annuitles. The intere&s;t, therefore, of her debt le&s;&s;ens every year, and &s;he will have a &s;urplus up to the amount of three millions and a half, to apply to the purcha&s;e of that part of the debt which is on perpetual in|tere&s;t; therefore, without any new taxes for that purpo&s;e, &s;he can di&s;charge her whole debt in le&s;s than a third of the time on which it can be done in England, according to Mr. Pitt's plan, with his additional tax of a million a year.</P>
<P>But let the event of Mr. Pitt's plan be what it may, as to reducing the debt, there is one circum&s;tance that cannot fail to accompany it, which is, that of making it the intere&s;t of Government, in execut|ing this plan, to undermine the intere&s;t of its creditors, or the value of the funds, for the purpo&s;e of purcha&s;ing at a cheaper rate.</P>
<P>The plan is founded on the pre&s;umption of a long uninterrupted peace, and that fu|ture
<PB N="55" REF="58">loans would not be wanted, which can not now be expected, for France in her turn is getting into a temper for war. The plan naturally &s;trikes at the credit of Govern|ment, in contracting further debts, for were a loan to be opened to-morrow, the &s;ub&s;cribers, naturally perceiving that it was the intere&s;t of Government to undermine them as &s;oon as they became creditors, would con&s;equent|ly &s;eek to &s;ecure them&s;elves, by demand|ing higher premiums at fir&s;t. It is a que&s;tion, whether a premium of thirty per cent. is now as good as ten was before, and therefore the plan, in ca&s;e of a war, in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening the debt, &s;erves to pu&s;h it more ra|pidly on.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ter certainly never under&s;tood the natural operation of his plan, or he would not have acted as he has done. The plan has two edges, while he has &s;uppo&s;ed it to have only one. It &s;trikes at the debt in peace, and at the credit in war.</P>
<P>The gentleman who originally furni&s;hed the Mini&s;ter with this plan, now gives it totally up. He knew its operation both in peace and war, but the Mini&s;ter appears not to
<PB N="56" REF="59">have comprehended it: But if he has made a mi&s;take, his youth and inexperience mu&s;t be his apology.</P>
<P>The plan, unle&s;s it &s;hould be altered, that is given out for providing for the expence of the late armaments, is in reality no other than the American plan of paper money, and it is very probable that the Mini&s;ter has re|ceived it from &s;ome American refugee.</P>
<P>The plan given out is, that the Mini&s;ter is to borrow the MONEY of the Bank. Here is the delu&s;ion. The name of MONEY co|vers the deception. For the ca&s;e is, that the Bank do not lend the real money, but it i&s;&s;ues out an emi&s;&s;ion of Bank-paper, and the pre&s;umption is, that there will be no run upon the Bank in con&s;equence of &s;uch an ex|traordinary emi&s;&s;ion, but if there &s;hould, no man can be at a lo&s;s in fore&s;eeing the i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>There are tho&s;e who remember that on a former run, the Bank was obliged to prolong the time by paying &s;hillings and &s;ixpences, and it is univer&s;ally credited that a quantity of &s;ilver is now pre&s;erved in the Bank for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; but the device, to every per&s;on of reflection, &s;hews that the capital
<PB N="57" REF="60">is not equal to the demands, and that the Chapter of Accidents is part of the Bible of Bank.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked why do not the Govern|ment i&s;&s;ue the paper in&s;tead of the Bank? The an&s;wer is, that it is exactly the &s;ame thing in the end, only with this difference in the mode, that were the Government to do it, it would be too vi&s;ible a &s;y&s;tem of pa|per currency, and that a di&s;gui&s;e is nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>Having recour&s;e to the Bank, is a kind of playing the Bank off again&s;t the Funds. Fighting one kind of paper again&s;t another, and in the combat both will be &s;uf|ferers.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the delu&s;ion of paper riches is working as rapidly in England as it did in America. A young and inexperienced Mi|ni&s;ter, like a young and inexperienced Con|gre&s;s, may &s;uppo&s;e that he &s;ees mines of wealth in a printing-pre&s;s, and that a nation cannot be exhau&s;ted while there is paper and ink enough to print paper money. Every new emi&s;&s;ion, until the delu&s;ion bur&s;ts, will appear to the nation an increa&s;e of wealth.
<PB N="58" REF="61">Every merchant's coffers will appear a trea|&s;ury, and he will &s;well with paper riches till he becomes a bankrupt.</P>
<P>When a Bank makes too free with its paper, it expo&s;es it&s;elf in much the &s;ame manner which a Government does that makes too free with its power; too much credit is as bad as too little; and there is &s;uch a thing as governing too much as well in a Bank as in a Government. But nothing expo&s;es a Bank more than being under the influence, in&s;tead of the protection of Go|vernment, and whenever either the property or the credit of a Bank can be commanded or influenced by a Government, or a Mini|&s;ter, its de&s;truction is not far off.</P>
<P>We have now &s;tated the comparative con|dition of England and France as to money matters. But there yet remain &s;ome things nece&s;&s;ary to be touched upon.</P>
<P>It is an error very frequently committed in the world to mi&s;take di&s;po&s;ition for con|dition.</P>
<P>France with a much better permanent con|dition for war than England, is in a le&s;s di&s;|po&s;ition to enter into one, and this want of
<PB N="59" REF="62">di&s;po&s;ition in her is mi&s;taken in England for want of condition; and on the other hand, the apparent di&s;po&s;ition in England for war is mi&s;taken by her for a condition to under|take and carry one on.</P>
<P>There appears a uniformity in all the works of Nature, from individual animals up to nations. The &s;maller animals are always the mo&s;t fretful, pa&s;&s;ionate, and in&s;ulting. They mi&s;take temper for &s;trength, and often fall a &s;acrifice to vexatious impetuo&s;ity, while larger ones go calmly on, and require re|peated provocations to incen&s;e them. France may yet be aggravated into war, and very probably will. Where the condition exi&s;ts the di&s;po&s;ition may at any time take place. We may create temper, but we cannot create &s;trength.</P>
<P>While the literature of England pre&s;erves an honourable rank among the nations of Europe, her national character is mo&s;t mi&s;erably &s;uffering in the world through her news-papers. The mo&s;t bare|faced per&s;idiou&s;ne&s;s, the mo&s;t abandoned principles are daily propagated. A total di&s;|regard to all the obligations of national faith
<PB N="60" REF="63">and honour are publicly profe&s;&s;ed. In&s;tead of that true greatne&s;s of heart, that calm grandeur of &s;entiment, that generous di&s;|dain of vulgar littlene&s;s that ought always to accompany the di&s;putes of nations, &s;carce|ly any thing is to be &s;een but mean abu&s;e and low &s;currility. This is not the ca&s;e in any other country in the world but Eng|land.</P>
<P>We will now proceed to conclude with a few additional ob&s;ervations on the &s;tate of politics.</P>
<P>For &s;everal weeks the nation was amu&s;ed with the daily rumours of &s;ome great Ca|binet &s;ecret, and admiring how profoundly the &s;ecret was kept, when the only &s;ecret was, that there was no &s;ecret to divulge.</P>
<P>But this opinion of a &s;ecret very well &s;hews that the opinion of the nation was different to the opinion of the Mini&s;ter, or the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;ome great &s;ecret would not have taken place, as the affairs of the Stadtholder were then publicly known. It &s;hews that the nation did not think the Stadtholder of Holland a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for laying n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w taxes on England, and running into the ri&s;k
<PB N="61" REF="64">and expence of a war, and great was the &s;urpri&s;e when the declaration and counter declaration like twin mice peeped from the Cabinet.</P>
<P>But there is one &s;ecret that requires to be inve&s;tigated, which is, whether the Mini&s;ter did not know that France would not engage in a war, and whether the preparations were not an idle parade, founded on that know|ledge.</P>
<P>Whether it was not meanly putting Eng|land under the banners of Pru&s;&s;ia, and tak|ing thereby a di&s;honourable advantage of the internal perplexity which France was then in, and which in its turn may happen to England, to a&s;&s;ume the air of a challenge, which it mu&s;t be known would not be ac|cepted, becau&s;e there was nothing to make the acceptance nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Whether this conduct in the Mini&s;ter does not mi&s;chievou&s;ly operate to de&s;troy the har|mony that appeared to be growing up be|tween the two nations; to le&s;&s;en, if not to|tally de&s;troy, the advantages of the Com|mercial Treaty, and to lay the &s;eeds of fu|ture
<PB N="62" REF="65">wars, when there was a pro&s;pect of a long and uninterrupted peace.</P>
<P>When there are two ways of accompli&s;h|ing the &s;ame object, it almo&s;t always happens that the one is better than the other, and whether the Mini&s;ter has not cho&s;en the wor&s;t. A few ob&s;ervations will elucidate this point.</P>
<P>It &s;ignifies not what airy &s;chemes, projects, or even treaties may be formed, e&s;pecially if done under the point of the bayonet, for all that can be expected from Holland is neutra|lity. Her trade is with all nations, and it is from her neutrality that this trade has ari&s;en. De&s;troy this neutrality and Holland is de|&s;troyed. Therefore it matters not what party &s;entiments men may be of in Holland as to the Stadtholder&s;hip, becau&s;e there is &s;till a &s;uperior banner under which all will unite.</P>
<P>Holland will not expo&s;e her trade to the deva&s;tations of England by joining France in a war, neither will &s;he expo&s;e it to France by joining England. It may very well be a&s;ked, what are England or France to Hol|land, that &s;he &s;hould join with either in a
<PB N="63" REF="66">war, unle&s;s &s;he is compelled to it by one or the other making war upon her, as was the ca&s;e in the la&s;t war.</P>
<P>Events may &s;oon happen in Europe to make all the force that Pru&s;&s;ia can rai&s;e ne|ce&s;&s;ary to her own defence, and Holland mu&s;t be wi&s;e enough to &s;ee, that by joining Eng|land &s;he not only expo&s;es her trade to France but likewi&s;e her dominions, becau&s;e France can invade her in a quarter in which England cannot defend her, for Holland lies open to France by land. It is, therefore, more immediately the intere&s;t of Holland to keep on good terms with France, neither can England give her any equivalent to ba|lance this circum&s;tance. How fooli&s;h then are the politics which are directed to unna|tural and impo&s;&s;ible objects. Surely the ex|perience of a century pa&s;t is &s;ufficient to &s;hew to any man, except one of ye&s;terday, what the conduct of Holland in all ca&s;es mu&s;t be.</P>
<P>But there is another circum&s;tance that do not fail to impre&s;s foreigners, and e&s;pecially Holland, which is, that the immen&s;ity of the national debt of England, the pro&s;pect of its &s;till encrea&s;ing, and the exorbitancy of her
<PB N="64" REF="67">paper currencies, render her too in&s;ecure in her&s;elf to be much confided in by foreign na|tions for any length of time. Becau&s;e that which mu&s;t happen may &s;oon happen.</P>
<P>Concerning the re&s;cript delivered by the French Mini&s;ter, there is one certain expla|nation to be put upon it, which is, that if France had been di&s;po&s;ed for war, &s;he would not have made that communication. The very making it goes to a full explanation of the parts; and as &s;oon as Mr. Pitt obtained this knowledge, it appeared to him a &s;afe moment to gird on his &s;word, and when he found that France was as well weaponed as him&s;elf to propo&s;e to take it off again. This is in a few words the whole hi&s;tory of the campaign. A war Mini&s;ter in peace, and a peace Mini&s;ter in war. Brave where there is no danger, and prudent when there is.</P>
<P>The re&s;cript could be nothing el&s;e than an explanation, on the part of France, of the &s;ituation &s;he conceived her&s;elf to be &s;ubject to, and the probable con&s;equences that might follow from it. This &s;he was not obliged to make, and therefore her making it was a matter of civil communication towards a
<PB N="65" REF="68">power &s;he was at peace with, and which in return entitled her to a &s;imilar communica|tion on the part of the Briti&s;h Cabinet. All this might have been done without either the expence, the tumult, the provocations, or the ill-blood that has been created.</P>
<P>The alliance between France and the Dutch, was formed while the Stadtholder was a part of the Government, therefore France could not from that alliance take a part either for or again&s;t him. She could only act when the whole intere&s;t of the Repub|lic was expo&s;ed to a foreign enemy, and it was not certain that this might not be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The re&s;cript, therefore, in&s;tead of being taken as a ground for war, was in it&s;elf a ground for peace, becau&s;e it tended to bring on a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of all the circum&s;tances of France and England relative to Holland, which could not have failed to place Hol|land in a &s;tate of neutrality, and that only will be the final event now; becau&s;e, inde|pendent of all parties, no other is con&s;i&s;tent with the whole national intere&s;t of that Re|public.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="69">But this not being done, it is now left to the Dutch to do it for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>An alliance with England, at the &s;ame time there is one exi&s;ting with France, will &s;ecure this neutrality &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the Dutch republic. By this &s;troke of Politics &s;he will be free from all obligations to join with either in a war, and be guaranteed by both. Her alliance with England will de|bar England from mole&s;ting her trade by &s;ea, and that with France will debar France from the &s;ame thing, and like|wi&s;e from invading her by land in all future ca&s;es. There are &s;o many probable circum|&s;tances to ari&s;e on the Continent of Europe, that the &s;ituation of Holland requires this &s;afeguard, more e&s;pecially from France, on account of her land connection.</P>
<P>The ri&s;ing greatne&s;s of the Ru&s;&s;ian Em|pire, the probable union of the intere&s;t of this Empire with that of Germany and France, and con&s;equently with Spain, who&s;e intere&s;ts cannot be &s;eparated, and the probability of a rupture between the Emperor and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, are matters that cannot fail to im|pre&s;s the Dutch with the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;e|curing them&s;elves by land as well as by &s;ea,
<PB N="67" REF="70">and to prevent their being drawn into the quarrels either of England or France.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, as there was a civil as well as an uncivil line of politics to be pur|&s;ued, every man of humane and generous &s;en|timents mu&s;t lament it was not cho&s;en.</P>
<P>A di&s;po&s;ition for peace was growing up in every part of France, and there appeared at the &s;ame time a mutual one ri&s;ing in England. A &s;ilent wi&s;h on both &s;ides, was univer&s;ally expanding it&s;elf, that wars, &s;o fatal to the true intere&s;t, and burthen &s;ome by taxes to the &s;ubjects of both countries might exi&s;t no more, and that a long and la&s;ting peace might take place.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of cultivating this happy op|portunity, the petti&s;h vanity of a young and unexperienced Mini&s;ter, who balanced him|&s;elf between peace and war to take his choice of circum&s;tances, in&s;tead of principles, and who went into an expen&s;ive armament when there was none to contend with, and not till after the affairs of Hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and might be &s;aid to be termi|nated, has de&s;troyed tho&s;e &s;eeds of harmony that might have been rendered of more value to both nations than their fleets and armies.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="71">He has permitted the nation to run mad under the univer&s;al influence of a groundle&s;s belief of va&s;t ho&s;tile armaments in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, and the &s;uppo&s;ition of a &s;e|cret that never exi&s;ted. By this means the &s;parks of ill-will are afre&s;h kindled up be|tween the nations, the fair pro&s;pect of la&s;t|ing peace is vani&s;hed, and a train of future evils fills up the &s;cene, and that at a time when the internal affairs of France, however confu&s;ed they at pre&s;ent appear, are natu|rally approaching to a great and harmonious encrea&s;e of its power.</P>
