<HEAD>THE AGE OF REASON: BEING AN INVESTIGATION OF TRUE AND OF FABULOUS THEOLOGY.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been my intention, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, to publi&s;h my thoughts upon religion. I am well aware of the difficulties that attend the &s;ubject; and from that con&s;ideration, had re&s;erved it to a more advanced period of life. I intended it to be the la&s;t offering I &s;hould make to my fellow-citizens of all nations; and that at a time, when the purity of the mo|tive that induced me to it, could not admit of a que&s;tion, even by tho&s;e who might di&s;approve the work.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance that has now taken place in France, of the total abolition of the whole
<PB N="2" REF="4">national order of prie&s;thood, and of every thing appertaining to compul&s;ive &s;y&s;tems of religion, and compul&s;ive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly nece&s;&s;ary; le&s;t, in the general wreck of &s;uper&s;tition, of fal&s;e &s;y&s;tems of government, and fal&s;e theology, we lo&s;e &s;ight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.</P>
<P>As &s;everal of my colleagues, and others of my fellow-citizens of France, have given me the example of making their voluntary and in|dividual profe&s;&s;ion of faith, I al&s;o will make mine; and I do this with all that &s;incerity and frankne&s;s with which the mind of man com|municates with it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happine&s;s beyond this life.</P>
<P>I believe the equality of man, and I believe that religious duties con&s;i&s;t in doing ju&s;tice, loving mercy, and endeavouring to make our fellow-creatures happy.</P>
<P>But le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed that I believe many other things in addition to the&s;e, I &s;hall, in the progre&s;s of this work, declare the things
<PB N="3" REF="5">I do not believe, and my rea&s;ons for not be|lieving them.</P>
<P>I do not believe in the creed profe&s;&s;ed by the Jewi&s;h church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turki&s;h church, by the Prote&s;tant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.</P>
<P>All national in&s;titutions of churches, whether Jewi&s;h, Chri&s;tian, or Turki&s;h, appear to me no other than human inventions &s;et up to ter|rify and en&s;lave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.</P>
<P>I do not mean by this declaration to con|demn tho&s;e who believe otherwi&s;e. They have the &s;ame right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of man, that he be mentally faithful to him&s;elf. Infidelity does not con&s;i&s;t in believing, or in di&s;believing: it con&s;i&s;ts in profe&s;&s;ing to believe what he does not believe.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to calculate the moral mi&s;chief, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, that mental lying has produced in &s;ociety. When a man has &s;o far corrupted and pro&s;tituted the cha&s;tity of his mind, as to &s;ub&s;cribe his profe&s;&s;ional belief to
<PB N="4" REF="6">things he does not believe, he has prepared him&s;elf for the commi&s;&s;ion of every other crime. He takes up the trade of a prie&s;t for the &s;ake of gain, and in order to <HI>qualify</HI> him&s;elf for that trade, he begins with a perjury. Can we con|ceive any thing more de&s;tructive to morality than this?</P>
<P>Soon after I had publi&s;hed the pamphlet, COMMON-SENSE, in America, I &s;aw the exceeding probability that a Revolution in the Sy&s;tem of Government, would be followed by a revolution in the &s;y&s;tem of religion. The adulterous con|nection of church and &s;tate, wherever it had taken place, whether Jewi&s;h, Chri&s;tian, or Turki&s;h, had &s;o effectually prohibited, by pains and penalties, every di&s;cu&s;&s;ion upon e&s;ta|bli&s;hed creeds, and upon fir&s;t principles of religion, that until the &s;y&s;tem of government &s;hould be changed, tho&s;e &s;ubjects could not be brought fairly and openly before the world: but that whenever this &s;hould be done, a revolution in the &s;y&s;tem of religion would follow. Human inventions and prie&s;t-craft would be detected; and man would return to the pure, unmixed, and unadulterated belief of one God, and no more.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">Every national church or religion has e&s;ta|bli&s;hed it&s;elf by pretending &s;ome &s;pecial mi&s;&s;ion from God communicated to certain individuals. The Jews have their Mo&s;es; the Chri&s;tians their Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their apo&s;tles and &s;aints; and the Turks their Mahomet; as if the way to God was not open to every man alike.</P>
<P>Each of tho&s;e churches &s;how certain books which they call <HI>revelation,</HI> or the word of God. The Jews &s;ay that their word of God was given by God to Mo&s;es face to face; the Chri&s;|tians &s;ay, that their word of God came by di|vine in&s;piration; and the Turks &s;ay, that their word of God (the Koran) was brought by an angel from heaven. Each of tho&s;e churches accu&s;es the other of unbelief; and, for my own part, I di&s;believe them all.</P>
<P>As it is nece&s;&s;ary to affix right ideas to words, I will, before I proceed further into the &s;ubject, offer &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the word <HI>revelation.</HI> Revelation, when applied to religion, means &s;omething communicated <HI>immediately</HI> from God to man.</P>
<P>No one will deny or di&s;pute the power of the Almighty to make &s;uch a communication if he plea&s;es. But admitting, for the &s;ake of
<PB N="6" REF="8">a ca&s;e, that &s;omething has been revealed to a certain per&s;on, and not revealed to any other per&s;on, it is revelation to that per&s;on only. When he tells it to a &s;econd per&s;on, a &s;econd to a third, a third to a fourth, and &s;o on, it cea&s;es to be a revelation to all tho&s;e per&s;ons. It is revelation to the fir&s;t per&s;on only, and <HI>hear&s;ay</HI> to every other; and con&s;equently, they are not obliged to believe it.</P>
<P>It is a contradiction in terms and ideas to call any thing a revelation that comes to us at &s;econd hand, either verbally or in writing. Revelation is nece&s;&s;arily limited to the fir&s;t communication. After this, it is only an ac|count of &s;omething which that per&s;on &s;ays was a revelation made to him; and though he may find him&s;elf obliged to believe it, it cannot be incumbent on me to believe it in the &s;ame manner, for it was not a re|velation made to <HI>me,</HI> and I have only his word for it that it was made to <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>When Mo&s;es told the children of I&s;rael that he received the two tables of the com|mandments from the hand of God, they were not obliged to believe him, becau&s;e they had no other authority for it than his telling them &s;o; and I have no other au|thority
<PB N="7" REF="9">for it than &s;ome hi&s;torian telling me &s;o. The commandments carrying no inter|nal evidence of divinity with them. They contain &s;ome good moral precepts, &s;uch as any man qualified to be a law-giver or a le|gi&s;lator could produce him&s;elf, without hav|ing recour&s;e to &s;upernatural intervention.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is, however, nece&s;&s;ary to except the declara|tion, which &s;ays, that God <HI>vi&s;its the &s;ins of the fathers upon the children.</HI> It is contrary to every principle of moral ju&s;tice.</NOTE></P>
<P>When I am told that the Koran was writ|ten in heaven, and brought to Mahomet by an angel, the account comes to near the &s;ame kind of hear&s;ay evidence, and &s;econd hand authority, as the former. I did not &s;ee the angel my&s;elf, and therefore I have a right not to believe it.</P>
<P>When al&s;o I am told that a woman, called the Virgin Mary, &s;aid, or gave out, that &s;he was with child without any cohabitation with a man, and that her betrothed hu&s;band, Jo&s;eph, &s;aid, that an angel told him &s;o, I have a right to believe them or not: &s;uch a circum&s;tance required a much &s;tronger
<PB N="8" REF="10">evidence than their bare word for it: but we have not even this; for neither Jo&s;eph nor Mary wrote any &s;uch matter them&s;elves. It is only reported by others that <HI>they &s;aid &s;o.</HI> It is hear&s;ay upon hear&s;ay, and I do not chu&s;e to re&s;t my belief upon &s;uch evidence.</P>
<P>It is, however, not difficult to account for the credit that was given to the &s;tory of Je&s;us Chri&s;t being the Son of God. He was born when the heathen mythology had &s;till &s;ome fa&s;hion and repute in the world, and that mythology had prepared the peo|ple for the belief of &s;uch a &s;tory. Almo&s;t all the extraordinary men that lived under the heathen mythology were reputed to be the &s;ons of &s;ome of their gods. It was not a new thing at that time to believe a man to have been cele&s;tially begotten: the intercour&s;e of gods with women was then a matter of familiar opinion. Their Jupiter, according to their accounts, had cohabited with hundreds: the &s;tory, therefore, had nothing in it either new, wonderful, or ob&s;cene: it was conform|able to the opinions that then prevailed among the people called Gentiles, or mythologi&s;ts, and it was tho&s;e people only that believed it. The Jews who had kept &s;trictly to the belief of one God, and no more, and who had always
<PB N="9" REF="11">rejected the heathen mythology, never credited the &s;tory.</P>
<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve how the theory of what is called the Chri&s;tian church, &s;prung out of the tail of the heathen mythology. A direct incorporation took place in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, by making the reputed founder to be cele&s;tially begotten. The trinity of gods that then fol|lowed was no other than a reduction of the former plurality, which was about twenty or thirty thou&s;and. The &s;tatue of Mary &s;uc|ceeded the &s;tatue of Diana of Ephe&s;us. The deification of heroes, changed into the cannoni|zation of &s;aints. The mythologi&s;ts had gods for every thing; the Chri&s;tian mythologi&s;ts had &s;aints for every thing. The church became as crouded with the one, as the pantheon had been with the other; and Rome was the place of both. The Chri&s;tian theory is little el&s;e than the idolatry of the ancient mythologi&s;ts, accommodated to the purpo&s;es of power and revenue; and it yet remains to rea&s;on and phi|lo&s;ophy to aboli&s;h the amphibious fraud.</P>
<P>Nothing that is here &s;aid can apply, even with the mo&s;t di&s;tant di&s;re&s;pect, to the <HI>real</HI> cha|racter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He was a virtuous and an amiable man. The morality that he
<PB N="10" REF="12">preached and practi&s;ed was of the mo&s;t bene|volent kind; and though &s;imilar &s;y&s;tems of morality had been preached by Confucius, and by &s;ome of the Greek philo&s;ophers, many years before; by the quakers &s;ince; and by many good men in all ages; it has not been ex|ceeded by any.</P>
<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t wrote no account of him&s;elf, of his birth, parentage, or any thing el&s;e. Not a line of what is called the New Te&s;tament is of his writing. The hi&s;tory of him is altoge|ther the work of other people; and as to the account given of his re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion, it was the nece&s;&s;ary counterpart to the &s;tory of his birth. His hi&s;torians, having brought him into the world in a &s;upernatural manner, were obliged to take him out again in the &s;ame manner, or the fir&s;t part of the &s;tory mu&s;t have fallen to the ground.</P>
<P>The wretched contrivance with which this latter part is told, exceeds every thing that went before it. The fir&s;t part, that of the mi|raculous conception, was not a thing that ad|mitted of publicity; and therefore the tellers of this part of the &s;tory, had this advantage, that though they might not be credited, they could not be detected. They could not be expected
<PB N="11" REF="13">to prove it, becau&s;e it was not one of tho&s;e things that admitted of proof, and it was im|po&s;&s;ible that the per&s;on of whom it was told could prove it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But the re&s;urrection of a dead per&s;on from the grave, and his a&s;cen&s;ion through the air, is a thing very different as to the evidence it admits of, to the invi&s;ible conception of a child in the womb. The re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion, &s;uppo&s;ing them to have taken place, admitted of public and occular demon&s;tration, like that of the a&s;cen&s;ion of a balloon, or the &s;un at noon day, to all Jeru&s;alem at lea&s;t. A thing which every body is required to believe, requires that the proof and evidence of it &s;hould be equal to all, and univer&s;al; and as the public vi&s;i|bility of this la&s;t related act was the only evi|dence that could give &s;anction to the former part, the whole of it falls to the ground, be|cau&s;e that evidence never was given. In&s;tead of this, a &s;mall number of per&s;ons, not more than eight or nine, are introduced as proxies for the whole world, to &s;ay, they <HI>&s;aw it,</HI> and all the re&s;t of the world are called upon to believe it. But it appears that Thomas did not be|lieve the re&s;urrection; and, as they &s;ay, would not believe, without having occular and manual demon&s;tration him&s;elf. <HI>So neither will I;</HI> and
<PB N="12" REF="14">the rea&s;on is equally as good for me and for every other per&s;on, as for Thomas.</P>
<P>It is in vain to attempt to palliate or di&s;gui&s;e this matter. The &s;tory, &s;o far as relates to the &s;upernatural part, has every mark of fraud and impo&s;ition &s;tamped upon the face of it. Who were the authors of it is as impo&s;&s;ible for us now to know, as it is for us to be a&s;&s;ured, that the books in which the account is related, were written by the per&s;ons who&s;e names they bear. The be&s;t &s;urviving evidence we now have re|&s;pecting this affair is the Jews. They are re|gularly de&s;cended from the people who lived in the times this re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion is &s;aid to have happened, and they &s;ay, <HI>it is not true.</HI> It has long appeared to me a &s;trange incon|&s;i&s;tency to cite the Jews as a proof of the truth of the &s;tory. It is ju&s;t the &s;ame as if a man were to &s;ay, I will prove the truth of what I have told you, by producing the people who &s;ay it is fal&s;e.</P>
<P>That &s;uch a per&s;on as Je&s;us Chri&s;t exi&s;ted, and that he was crucified, which was the mode of execution at that day, are hi&s;torical relations &s;trictly within the limits of probability. He preached mo&s;t excellent morality, and the equa|lity of man; but he preached al&s;o again&s;t the
<PB N="13" REF="15">corruptions and avarice of the Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts; and this brought upon him the hatred and ven|geance of the whole order of prie&s;t-hood. The accu&s;ation which tho&s;e prie&s;ts brought again&s;t him, was that of &s;edition and con&s;piracy again&s;t the Roman government, to which the Jews were then &s;ubject and tributary; and it is not improbable that the Roman government might have &s;ome &s;ecret apprehen&s;ion of the effects of his doctrine as well as the Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts; nei|ther is it improbable that Je&s;us Chri&s;t had in contemplation the delivery of the Jewi&s;h nation from the bondage of the Romans. Between the two, however, this virtuous reformer and revolutioni&s;t lo&s;t his life.</P>
<P>It is upon this plain narrative of facts, toge|ther with another ca&s;e I am going to mention, that the Chri&s;tian mythologi&s;ts, calling them|&s;elves the Chri&s;tian church, have erected their fable, which for ab&s;urdity and extravagance is not exceeded by any thing that is to be found in the mythology of the ancients.</P>
<P>The ancient mythologi&s;ts tell that the race of Giants made war again&s;t Jupiter, and that one of them threw an hundred rocks again&s;t him at one throw; that Jupiter defeated him with thunder, and confined him afterwards un|der
<PB N="14" REF="16">Mount Etna; and that every time the Giant turns him&s;elf, Mount Etna belches fire. It is here ea&s;y to &s;ee that the circum&s;tance of the mountain, that of its being a volcano, &s;ug|ge&s;ted the idea of the fable; and that the fable is made to fit and wind it&s;elf up with that circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian mythologi&s;ts tell that their Satan made war again&s;t the Almighty, who defeated him, and confined him afterwards, not under a mountain, but in a pit. It is here ea&s;y to &s;ee that the fir&s;t fable &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of the &s;econd; for the fable of Jupiter and the Giants was told many hundred years be|fore that of Satan.</P>
<P>Thus far the ancient and the Chri&s;tian my|thologi&s;ts differ very little from each other. But the latter have contrived to carry the matter much farther. They have contrived to connect the fabulous part of the &s;tory of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with the fable originating from Mount Etna: and in order to make all the parts of the &s;tory tye together, they have taken to their aid the traditions of the Jews; for the Chri&s;tian mythology is made up partly from the ancient mythology, and partly from the Jewi&s;h traditions.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">The Chri&s;tian mythologi&s;ts, after having confined Satan in a pit, were obliged to let him out again, to bring on the &s;equel of the fable. He is then introduced into the garden of Eden in the &s;hape of a &s;nake, or a &s;erpent, and in that &s;hape he enters into familiar con|ver&s;ation with Eve, who is no ways &s;urpri&s;ed to hear a &s;nake talk; and the i&s;&s;ue of this t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te is, that he per&s;uades her to eat an apple, and the eating of that apple, damns all mankind.</P>
<P>After giving Satan this triumph over the whole creation, one would have &s;uppo&s;ed that the church mythologi&s;ts would have been kind enough to &s;end him back again to the pit; or, if they had not done this, that they would have put a mountain upon him, (for they &s;ay that their faith can remove a mountain) or have put him <HI>under</HI> a mountain, as the former my|thologi&s;ts had done, to prevent his getting again among the women, and doing more mi&s;|chief. But in&s;tead of this, they leave him at large without even obliging him to give his parole. The &s;ecret of which is, that they could not do without him; and after being at the trouble of making him, they bribed him to &s;tay. They promi&s;ed him ALL the Jews, ALL the Turks by anticipation, nine-tenths
<PB N="16" REF="18">of the world be&s;ide, and Mahomet into the bargain. After this, who can doubt the bountifulne&s;s of the Chri&s;tian mythology?</P>
<P>Having thus made an in&s;urrection and a battle in heaven, in which none of the comba|tants could be either killed or wounded&mdash;put Satan into the pit&mdash;let him out again&mdash;given him a triumph over the whole creation&mdash; damned all mankind by the eating of an apple, the&s;e Chri&s;tian mythologi&s;ts bring the two ends of their fable together. They repre&s;ent this virtuous and amiable man, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to be at once both God and man, and al&s;o the Son of God, cele&s;tially begotten on purpo&s;e to be &s;acrificed, becau&s;e, they &s;ay, that Eve in her longing had eaten an apple.</P>
<P>Putting a&s;ide every thing that might excite laughter by its ab&s;urdity, or dete&s;tation by its prophanene&s;s, and confining our&s;elves merely to an examination of the parts, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive a &s;tory more derogatory to the Almighty, more incon&s;i&s;tent with his wi&s;dom, more contradictory to his power, than this &s;tory is.</P>
<P>In order to make for it a foundation to ri&s;e upon, the inventors were under the nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="17" REF="19">of giving to the being, whom they call Satan, a power equally as great, if not greater, than they attribute to the Almighty. They have not only given him the power of liberating him&s;elf from the pit, after what they call his fall, but they have made that power increa&s;e afterwards to infinity. Before this fall, they repre&s;ent him only as an angel of limited exi&s;tence, as they repre|&s;ent the re&s;t. After his fall, he becomes, by their account, omnipre&s;ent. He exi&s;ts every where, and at the &s;ame time. He occupies the whole immen&s;ity of &s;pace.</P>
<P>Not content with this deification of Satan, they repre&s;ent him as defeating by &s;tra|tagem, in the &s;hape of an animal of the creation, all the power and wi&s;dom of the Almighty. They repre&s;ent him as having compelled the Almighty to the <HI>direct ne|ce&s;&s;ity</HI> either of &s;urrendering the whole of the creation to the government and &s;ove|reignty of this Satan, or of capitulating for its redemption by coming down upon earth, and exhibiting him&s;elf upon a cro&s;s in the &s;hape of a man.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">Had the inventors of this &s;tory told it the contrary way, that is, had they repre|&s;ented the Almighty as compelling Satan to exhibit <HI>him&s;elf</HI> on a cro&s;s in the &s;hape of a &s;nake, as a puni&s;hment for his new tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, the &s;tory would have been le&s;s ab|&s;urd, le&s;s contradictory. But in&s;tead of this, they make the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or triumph, and the Almighty fall.</P>
<P>That many good men have believed this &s;trange fable and lived very good lives un|der that belief (for credulity is not a crime) is what I have no doubt of. In the fir&s;t place, they were educated to believe it, and they would have believed any thing el&s;e in the &s;ame manner. There are al&s;o many who have been &s;o enthu&s;ia&s;tically enraptured by what they conceived to be the infinite love of God to man, in making a &s;acrifice of him&s;elf, that the vehemence of the idea has forbidden and deterred them from exa|mining into the ab&s;urdity and profanene&s;s of the &s;tory. The more unnatural any thing is, the more is it capable of becoming the object of di&s;mal admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21">But if objects for gratitude and admiration are our de&s;ire, do they not pre&s;ent them|&s;elves every hour to our eyes? Do we not &s;ee a fair creation prepared to receive us the in&s;tant we were born &mdash; a world furni&s;hed to our hands that co&s;t us nothing? Is it we that light up the &s;un; that pour down the rain; and fill the earth with abundance? Whether we &s;leep or wake, the va&s;t ma|chinery of the univer&s;e &s;till goes on. Are the&s;e things, and the ble&s;&s;ings they indicate in future, nothing to us? Can our gro&s;s feelings be excited by no other &s;ubjects than tragedy and &s;uicide? Or is the gloomy pride of man become &s;o intolerable, that nothing can flatter it but a &s;acrifice of the Creator?</P>
<P>I know that this bold inve&s;tigation will alarm many, but it would be paying too great a compliment to their credulity to for|bear it upon that account. The times and the &s;ubject demand it to be done. The &s;u&s;|picion that the theory of what is called the Chri&s;tian church is fabulous, is becoming very exten&s;ive in all countries; and it will be a con&s;olation to men &s;taggering under
<PB N="20" REF="22">that &s;u&s;picion, and doubting what to believe and what to di&s;believe, to &s;ee the &s;ubject freely inve&s;tigated. I therefore pa&s;s on to an examination of the books called the Old and the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>The&s;e books, beginning with Gene&s;is and ending with Revelations (which by the bye is a book of riddles that requires a Revela|tion to explain it) are, we are told, the word of God. It is therefore proper for us to know who told us &s;o, that we may know what credit to give to the report. The an|&s;wer to this que&s;tion is, that nobody can tell, except that we tell one another &s;o. The ca&s;e, however, hi&s;torically appears to be as follows:</P>
<P>When the church mythologi&s;ts e&s;tabli&s;hed their &s;y&s;tem, they collected all the writings they could find, and managed them as they plea&s;ed. It is a matter altogether of un|certainty to us whether &s;uch of the writings as now appear, under the name of the Old and the New Te&s;tament, are in the &s;ame &s;tate in which tho&s;e collectors &s;ay they found them; or whether they added, alter|ed, abridged, or dre&s;&s;ed them up.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">Be this as it may, they decided by <HI>vote</HI> which of the books out of the collection they had made, &s;hould be the WORD OF GOD, and which &s;hould not. They reject|ed &s;everal; they voted others to be doubt|ful, &s;uch as the books called the Apocra|phy; and tho&s;e books which had a majority of votes, were voted to be the word of God. Had they voted otherwi&s;e, all the people, &s;ince calling them&s;elves chri&s;tians, had believed otherwi&s;e; for the belief of the one comes from the vote of the other. Who the people were that did all this, we know nothing of; they called them&s;elves by the general name of the church; and this is all we know of the matter.</P>
<P>As we have no other external evidence or authority for believing tho&s;e books to be the word of God, than what I have mentioned, which is no evidence or au|thority at all, I come, in the next place, to examine the internal evidence contained in the books them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the former part of this e&s;&s;ay, I have &s;poken of revelation. I now proceed further
<PB N="22" REF="24">with that &s;ubject, for the purpo&s;e of apply|ing it to the books in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Revelation is a communication of &s;ome|thing, which the per&s;on, to whom that thing is revealed, did not know before. For if I have done a thing, or &s;een it done, it needs no revelation to tell me I have done it, or &s;een it, nor to enable me to tell it, or to write it.</P>
<P>Revelation, therefore, cannot be applied to any thing done upon earth of which man is him&s;elf the actor or the witne&s;s; and con|&s;equently all the hi&s;torical and anecdotal part of the Bible, which is almo&s;t the whole of it, is not within the meaning and com|pa&s;s of the word revelation, and therefore is not the word of God.</P>
<P>When Sam&s;on ran off with the gate-po&s;ts of Gaza, if he ever did &s;o (and whether he did or not is nothing to us) or when he vi&s;ited his Delilah, or caught his foxes, or did any thing el&s;e, what has revelation to do with the&s;e things? If they were facts, he could tell them him&s;elf; or his &s;ecre|tary,
<PB N="23" REF="25">if he kept one, could write them, if they were worth either telling or writing; and if they were fictions, revelation could not make them true; and whether true or not, we are neither the better nor the wi&s;er for knowing them.&mdash;When we contemplate the immen&s;ity of that Being, who directs and governs the incomprehen&s;ible WHOLE, of which the utmo&s;t ken of human &s;ight can di&s;cover but a part, we ought to feel &s;hame at calling &s;uch paltry &s;tories the word of God.</P>
<P>As to the account of the creation, with which the book of Gene&s;is opens, it has all the appearance of being a tradition which the I&s;raelites had among them before they came into Egypt; and after their departure from that country, they put it at the head of their hi&s;tory, without telling, as it is mo&s;t probable that they did not know, how they came by it. The manner in which the account opens, &s;hews it to be tradi|tionary. It begins abruptly. It is nobody that &s;peaks. It is nobody that hears. It is addre&s;&s;ed to nobody. It has neither fir&s;t, &s;econd, nor third per&s;on. It has
<PB N="24" REF="26">every criterion of being a tradition. It has no voucher. Mo&s;es does not take it upon him&s;elf by introducing it with the formality that he u&s;es on other occa&s;ions, &s;uch as that of &s;aying, <HI>"The Lord &s;pake unto Mo&s;es, &s;aying."</HI></P>
<P>Why it has been called the Mo&s;aic ac|count of the creation, I am at a lo&s;s to con|ceive. Mo&s;es, I believe, was too good a judge of &s;uch &s;ubjects to put his name to that account. He had been educated among the Egyptians, who were a people as well &s;killed in &s;cience, and particularly in a&s;tro|nomy, as any people of their day; and the &s;ilence and caution that Mo&s;es ob&s;erves, in not authenticating the account, is a good negative evidence that he neither told it, nor believed it.&mdash;The ca&s;e is, that every na|tion of people has been world-makers, and the I&s;raelites had as much right to &s;et up the trade of world-making as any of the re&s;t; and as Mo&s;es was not an I&s;raelite, he might not chu&s;e to contradict the tradition. The account, however, is harmle&s;s; and this is more than can be &s;aid for many other parts of the Bible.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">Whenever we read the ob&s;cene &s;tories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vin|dictivene&s;s, with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more con&s;i&s;tent that we called it the word of a demon, than the word of God. It is a hi&s;tory of wicked|ne&s;s, that has &s;erved to corrupt and bruta|lize mankind; and, for my own part, I &s;incerely dete&s;t it, as I dete&s;t every thing that is cruel.</P>
<P>We &s;carcely meet with any thing, a few phra&s;es excepted, but what de&s;erves either our abhorrence, or our contempt, till we come to the mi&s;cellaneous parts of the Bible. In the anonymous publications, the P&s;alms and the book of Job, more particularly in the latter, we find a great deal of elevated &s;entiment reverentially expre&s;&s;ed of the power and benignity of the Almighty; but they &s;tand on no higher rank than many other compo&s;itions on &s;imilar &s;ubjects, as well before that time as &s;ince.</P>
<P>The proverbs, which are &s;aid to be Solo|mon's, though mo&s;t probably a collection
<PB N="26" REF="28">(becau&s;e they di&s;cover a knowledge of life, which his &s;ituation excluded him from know|ing) are an in&s;tructive table of ethics. They are inferior in keenne&s;s to the proverbs of the Spaniards, and not more wi&s;e and oecono|mical than tho&s;e of the American Franklin.</P>
<P>All the remaining parts of the Bible, ge|nerally known by the name of the prophets, are the works of the Jewi&s;h poets and itine|rant preachers, who mixed poetry, anecdote, and devotion together; and tho&s;e works &s;till retain the air and &s;tile of poetry, though in tran&s;lation.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As there are many readers who do not &s;ee that a compo&s;ition is poetry unle&s;s it be in rhyme, it is for their information that I add this note.</P>
<P>Poetry con&s;i&s;ts principally in two things: Imagery and compo&s;ition. The compo&s;ition of poetry differs from that of pro&s;e in the manner of mixing long and &s;hort &s;yllables together. Take a long &s;yllable out of a line of poetry, and put a &s;hort one in the room of it, or put a long &s;yllable where a &s;hort one &s;hould be, and that line will lo&s;e its poetical harmony. It will have an effect upon the line like that of mi&s;placing a note in a &s;ong.</P>
<P>The imagery in tho&s;e books, called the prophets, appertains altogether to poetry. It is fictitious and often extravagant, and not admi&s;&s;ible in any other kind of writing than poetry.</P>
<P>To &s;hew that the&s;e writings are compo&s;ed in poetical numbers, I will take ten &s;yllables as they &s;tand in the book, and make a line of the &s;ame number of &s;yllables (heroic mea&s;ure) that &s;hall rhyme with the la&s;t word. It will then be &s;een, that the compo&s;ition of tho&s;e books is poetical mea&s;ure. The in&s;tance I &s;hall fir&s;t produce is from I&s;aiah.</P>
<L><HI>"Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth."</HI></L>
<L>'Tis God him&s;elf that calls attention forth.</L>
<P>Another in&s;tance I &s;hall quote is from the mournful Jeremiah, to which I &s;hall add two other lines, for the purpo&s;e of carrying out the figure, and &s;hewing the intention of the poet.</P>
<L><HI>"O! that mine head were waters, and mine eyes"</HI></L>
<L>Were fountains, flowing like the liquid &s;kies;</L>
<L>Then would I give the mighty flood relea&s;e,</L>
<L>And weep a deluge for the human race.</L></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29">There is not, throughout the whole book, called the Bible, any word that de&s;cribes to us what we call a poet, nor any word that de&s;cribes what we call poetry. The ca&s;e is, that the word <HI>prophet,</HI> to which later times have affixed a new idea, was the Bible word
<PB N="28" REF="30">for poet, and the word <HI>prophe&s;ying</HI> meant the art of making poetry. It al&s;o meant the art of playing poetry to a tune upon any in&s;trument of mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>We read of prophe&s;ying with pipes, ta|brets, and horns. Of prophe&s;ying with harps, with p&s;alteries, with cymbals, and with every other in&s;trument of mu&s;ic then in fa&s;hion. Were we now to &s;peak of pro|phe&s;ying with a fiddle, or with a pipe and tabor, the expre&s;&s;ion would have no mean|ing, or would appear ridiculous, and to &s;ome people contemptuous, becau&s;e we have changed the meaning of the word.</P>
<P>We are told of Saul being among the <HI>prophets,</HI> and al&s;o that he prophe&s;ied; but we are not told what <HI>they prophe&s;ied,</HI> nor what <HI>he prophe&s;ied.</HI> The ca&s;e is, there was nothing to tell; for the&s;e prophets were a company of mu&s;icians and poets; and Saul joined in the concert; and this was called <HI>prophe&s;ying.</HI></P>
<P>The account given of this affair in the book called Samuel, is, that Saul met a
<PB N="29" REF="31"><HI>company</HI> of prophets; a whole company of them! coming down with a p&s;altery, a ta|bret, a pipe, and a harp, and that they pro|phe&s;ied, and that he prophe&s;ied with them. But it appears afterwards, that Saul prophe|&s;ied badly, that is, he performed his part badly; for it is &s;aid, that "an <HI>evil &s;pirit from God</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As tho&s;e men, who call them&s;elves divines and commentators, are very fond of puzzling one another, I leave them to conte&s;t the meaning of the fir&s;t part of the phra&s;e, that of, <HI>an evil &s;pirit of God.</HI> I keep to my text. I keep to the meaning of the word prophe&s;y.</NOTE> came upon Saul, and he prophe&s;ied."</P>
<P>Now were there no other pa&s;&s;age in the book, called the Bible, than this, to demon|&s;trate to us that we have lo&s;t the original mean|ing of the word <HI>prophe&s;y,</HI> and &s;ub&s;tituted ano|ther meaning in its place, this alone would be &s;ufficient; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to u&s;e and ap|ply the word <HI>prophe&s;y</HI> in the place it is here u&s;ed and applied, if we give to it the &s;en&s;e which later times have affixed to it. The manner in which it is here u&s;ed &s;trips it of all religious meaning, and &s;hews that a man might then be a <HI>prophet,</HI> or might <HI>prophe&s;y,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="32">as he may now be a poet, or a mu&s;ician, without any regard to the morality or the immorality of his character. The word was originally a term of &s;cience, promi&s;cuou&s;ly applied to poetry and to mu&s;ic, and not re|&s;tricted to any &s;ubject upon which poetry and mu&s;ic might be exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>Deborah and Barak are called prophets, not becau&s;e they predicted any thing, but becau&s;e they compo&s;ed the poem or &s;ong that bears their name in celebration of an act already done: David is ranked among the prophets, for he was a mu&s;ician; and was al&s;o reputed to be (though perhaps very er|roneou&s;ly) the author of the p&s;alms. But Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob, are not called prophets. It does not appear from any accounts we have that they could either &s;ing, play mu&s;ic, or make poetry.</P>
<P>We are told of the greater and the le&s;&s;er prophets. They might as well tell us of the greater and the le&s;&s;er God; for there cannot be degrees in prophe&s;ying con&s;i&s;tently with its modern &s;en&s;e. But there are degrees in poetry, and therefore the phra&s;e is recon|cilable
<PB N="31" REF="33">to the ca&s;e, when we under&s;tand by it the greater and the le&s;&s;er poets.</P>
<P>It is altogether unnece&s;&s;ary, after this, to offer any ob&s;ervations upon what tho&s;e men, &s;tiled prophets, have written. The axe goes at once to the root, by &s;hewing that the original meaning of the word has been mi&s;taken, and con&s;equently all the in|ferences that have been drawn from tho&s;e books, the devotional re&s;pect that has been paid to them, and the laboured commen|taries that have been written upon them, under that mi&s;taken meaning, are not worth di&s;puting about.&mdash;In many things, how|ever, the writings of the Jewi&s;h poets, de|&s;erve a better fate than that of being bound up, as they now are, with the tra&s;h that accompanies them, under the abu&s;ed name of the word of God.</P>
<P>If we permit our&s;elves to conceive right ideas of things, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily affix the idea, not only of unchangeablene&s;s, but of the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of any change taking place, by any means or accident whatever, in that which we would honour with the
<PB N="32" REF="34">name of the word of God; and therefore the word of God cannot exi&s;t in any written or human language.</P>
<P>The continually progre&s;&s;ive change to which the meaning of words is &s;ubject, the want of an univer&s;al language which renders tran&s;lations nece&s;&s;ary, the errors to which tran&s;lations are again &s;ubject, the mi&s;takes of copyi&s;ts and printers, together with the po&s;&s;ibility of wilful alteration, are of them|&s;elves evidences, that human language, whe|ther in &s;peech or in print, cannot be the vehicle of the word of God.&mdash;The word of God exi&s;ts in &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>Did the book, called the Bible, excel in purity of ideas and expre&s;&s;ion, all the books that are now extant in the world, I would not take it for my rule of faith, as being the word of God; becau&s;e the po&s;&s;ibility would neverthele&s;s exi&s;t of my being im|po&s;ed upon. But when I &s;ee throughout the greate&s;t part of this book, &s;carcely any thing but a hi&s;tory of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t vices, and a collection of the mo&s;t paltry and con|temptible
<PB N="33" REF="35">tales, I cannot di&s;honour my Creator by calling it by his name.</P>
<P>Thus much for the Bible. I now go on to the book called the New Te&s;tament. The <HI>new</HI> Te&s;tament! that is, the <HI>new</HI> Will, as if there could be two wills of the Creator.</P>
<P>Had it been the object or the intention of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to e&s;tabli&s;h a new religion, he would undoubtedly have written the &s;y&s;|tem him&s;elf, or <HI>procured it to be written</HI> in his life time. But there is no publication extant authenticated with his name. All the books called the New Te&s;tament were written after his death. He was a Jew by birth and by profe&s;&s;ion; and he was the &s;on of God in like manner that every other per|&s;on is; for the Creator is the Father of All.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t four books, called Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, do not give a hi&s;|tory of the life of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but only detached anecdotes of him. It appears from the&s;e books, that the whole time of his be|ing a preacher was not more than eighteen
<PB N="34" REF="36">months; and it was only during this &s;hort time, that tho&s;e men became acquainted with him. They make mention of him, at the age of twelve years, &s;itting, they &s;ay, among the Jewi&s;h doctors, a&s;king and an&s;wering them que&s;tions. As this was &s;e|veral years before their acquaintance with him began, it is mo&s;t probable they had this anecdote from his parents. From this time there is no account of him for about &s;ixteen years. Where he lived, or how he employed him&s;elf during this interval, is not known. Mo&s;t probably he was working at his father's trade, which was that of a car|penter. It does not appear that he had any &s;chool education, and the probability is that he could not write, for his parents were extremely poor, as appears from their not being able to pay for a bed when he was born.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat curious that the three per|&s;ons, who&s;e names are the mo&s;t univer&s;ally recorded, were of very ob&s;cure parentage. Mo&s;es was a foundling, Je&s;us Chri&s;t was born in a &s;table, and Mahomet was a mule driver. The fir&s;t and the la&s;t of the&s;e men,
<PB N="35" REF="37">were founders of different &s;y&s;tems of reli|gion; but Je&s;us Chri&s;t founded no new &s;y&s;tem. He called men to the practice of moral virtues, and the belief of one God. The great trait in his character is phi|lanthropy.</P>
<P>The manner in which he was appre|hended, &s;hews that he was not much known at that time; and it &s;hews al&s;o that the meetings he then held with his followers were in &s;ecret; and that he had given over, or &s;u&s;pended, preaching publicly. Judas could no otherways betray him than by giving information where he was, and point|ing him out to the officers that went to arre&s;t him; and the rea&s;on for employing and paying Judas to do this, could ari&s;e only from the cau&s;es already mentioned, that of his not being much known, and living concealed.</P>
<P>The idea of his concealment not only agrees very ill with his reputed divinity, but a&s;&s;ociates with it &s;omething of pu&s;illanimity; and his being betrayed, or in other words, his being apprehended, on the information
<PB N="36" REF="38">of one of his followers, &s;hews that he did not intend to be apprehended, and con|&s;equently that he did not intend to be crucified.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian mythologi&s;ts tell us, that Chri&s;t died for the &s;ins of the world, and that he came on <HI>purpo&s;e to die.</HI> Would it not then have been the &s;ame if he had died of a fever, or of the &s;mall pox, of old age, or of any thing el&s;e?</P>
<P>The declaratory &s;entence which, they &s;ay, was pa&s;&s;ed upon Adam in ca&s;e he ate of the apple, was not, that <HI>thou &s;halt &s;urely be cru|cified, but thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> The &s;entence was death, and not the <HI>manner of dying.</HI> Crucifixion, therefore, or any other parti|cular manner of dying, made no part of the &s;entence that Adam was to &s;uffer, and con&s;equently, even upon their own tactic, it could make no part of the &s;entence that Chri&s;t was to &s;uffer in the room of Adam. A fever would have done as well as a cro&s;s, if there was any occa&s;ion for either.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="39">This &s;entence of death which, they tell us, was thus pa&s;&s;ed upon Adam, mu&s;t either have meant dying naturally, that is, cea&s;ing to live, or, have meant what the&s;e mythologi&s;ts call damnation: and con&s;e|quently, the act of dying on the part of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, mu&s;t, according to their &s;y&s;tem, apply as a prevention to one or other of the&s;e two <HI>things</HI> happening to Adam and to us.</P>
<P>That it does not prevent our dying is evident, becau&s;e we all die; and if their accounts of longevity be true, men die fa&s;ter &s;ince the crucifixion than before: and with re&s;pect to the &s;econd explanation, (including with it the <HI>natural death</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t as a &s;ub&s;titute for the <HI>eternal death or damnation</HI> of all mankind) it is imperti|nently repre&s;enting the Creator as coming off, or revoking the &s;entence, by a pun or a quibble upon the word <HI>death.</HI> That ma|nufacturer of quibbles, St. Paul, if he wrote the books that bear his name, has helped this quibble on, by making another quibble upon the word <HI>Adam.</HI> He makes there to be two Adams; the one who &s;ins
<PB N="38" REF="40">in fact, and &s;uffers by proxy; the other who &s;ins by proxy and &s;uffers in fact. A religion thus interlarded with quibble, &s;ub|terfuge and pun, has a tendency to in&s;truct its profe&s;&s;ors in the practice of the&s;e arts. They acquire the habit without being aware of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>If Je&s;us Chri&s;t was the Being which tho&s;e mythologi&s;ts tell us he was, and that he came into this world to <HI>&s;uffer,</HI> which is a word they &s;ometimes u&s;e in&s;tead of <HI>to die,</HI> the only real &s;uffering he could have endured would have been <HI>to live.</HI> His exi&s;tence here was a &s;tate of exilement or tran&s;portation from heaven, and the way back to his original country was to die.&mdash;In fine, every thing in this &s;trange &s;y&s;tem is the rever&s;e of what it pretends to be. It is the rever&s;e of truth, and I become &s;o tired with examining into its incon&s;i&s;tencies and ab&s;urdities, that I ha&s;ten to the conclu&s;ion of it, in order to proceed to &s;omething better.</P>
<P>How much, or what parts of the books called the New Te&s;tament, were written by the per&s;ons who&s;e names they bear, is what
<PB N="39" REF="41">we can know nothing of, neither are we certain in what language they were originally written. The matters they now contain may be cla&s;&s;ed under two heads: anecdote, and epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>The four books already mentioned, Mat|thew, Mark, Luke, and John, are altoge|ther anecdotal. They relate events after they had taken place. They tell what Je&s;us Chri&s;t did and &s;aid, and what others did and &s;aid to him; and in &s;everal in&s;tances they relate the &s;ame event differently. Re|velation is nece&s;&s;arily out of the que&s;tion with re&s;pect to tho&s;e books; not only be|cau&s;e of the di&s;agreement of the writers, but becau&s;e revelation cannot be applied to the relating of facts by the per&s;ons who &s;aw them done, nor to the relating or recording of any di&s;cour&s;e or conver&s;ation by tho&s;e who heard it. The book, called the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, an anonymous work, be|longs al&s;o to the anecdotal part.</P>
<P>All the other parts of the New Te&s;tament, except the book of enigmas, called the Re|velations, are a collection of letters under
<PB N="40" REF="42">the name of Epi&s;tles; and the forgery of letters has been &s;uch a common practice in the world, that the probability is, at lea&s;t, equal, whether they are genuine or forged. One thing, however, is much le&s;s equivocal, which is, that out of the matters contained in tho&s;e books, together with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome old &s;tories, the church has &s;et up a &s;y&s;tem of religion very contradictory to the character of the per&s;on who&s;e name it bears. It has &s;et up a religion of pomp and of revenue in pretended imitation of a per&s;on who&s;e life was humility and poverty.</P>
<P>The invention of a purgatory, and of the relea&s;ing of &s;ouls therefrom, by prayers, bought of the church with money; the &s;elling of pardons, di&s;pen&s;ations, and indul|gences, are revenue laws, without bearing that name or carrying that appearance. But the ca&s;e neverthele&s;s is, that tho&s;e things derive their origin from the proxy&s;m of the crucifixion, and the theory deduced there|from, which was, that one per&s;on could &s;tand in the place of another, and could perform meritorious &s;ervices for him. The probability therefore is, that the whole
<PB N="41" REF="43">theory or doctrine of what is called the redemption (which is &s;aid to have been accompli&s;hed by the act of one per&s;on in the room of another) was originally fabri|cated on purpo&s;e to bring forward and build all tho&s;e &s;econdary and pecuniary redemp|tions upon; and that the pa&s;&s;ages in the books upon which the idea or theory of re|demption is built, have been manufactured and fabricated for that purpo&s;e. Why are we to give this church credit, when &s;he tells us that tho&s;e books are genuine in every part, any more than we give her credit for every thing el&s;e &s;he has told us; or for the miracles &s;he &s;ays &s;he has performed. That &s;he <HI>could</HI> fabricate writings is certain, becau&s;e &s;he could write; and the compo&s;ition of the writings in que&s;tion, is of that kind that any body might do it; and that &s;he <HI>did</HI> fabricate them is not more incon&s;i&s;tent with probabi|lity, than that &s;he &s;hould tell us, as &s;he has done, that &s;he could and did work miracles.</P>
<P>Since then no external evidence can, at this long di&s;tance of time, be produced to prove whether the church fabricated the doctrine called redemption or not (for &s;uch
<PB N="42" REF="44">evidence, whether for or again&s;t, would be &s;ubject to the &s;ame &s;u&s;picion of being fabri|cated) the ca&s;e can only be referred to the internal evidence which the thing carries of it&s;elf; and this affords a very &s;trong pre|&s;umption of its being a fabrication. For the internal evidence is, that the theory or doctrine of redemption has for its ba&s;is, an idea of pecuniary ju&s;tice, and not that of moral ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>If I owe a per&s;on money and cannot pay him, and he threatens to put me in pri&s;on, another per&s;on can take the debt upon him|&s;elf, and pay it for me. But if I have com|mitted a crime, every circum&s;tance of the ca&s;e is changed. Moral ju&s;tice cannot take the innocent for the guilty, even if the inno|cent would offer it&s;elf. To &s;uppo&s;e ju&s;tice to do this, is to de&s;troy the principle of its exi&s;tence, which is the thing it&s;elf. It is then no longer ju&s;tice. It is indi&s;criminate revenge.</P>
<P>This &s;ingle reflection will &s;hew that the doctrine of redemption is founded on a mere pecuniary idea corre&s;ponding to that of a
<PB N="43" REF="45">debt which another per&s;on might pay; and as this pecuniary idea corre&s;ponds again with the &s;y&s;tem of &s;econd redemptions ob|tained through the means of money given to the church, for pardons, the probability is, that the &s;ame per&s;ons fabricated both the one and the other of tho&s;e theories; and that, in truth, there is no &s;uch thing as re|demption; that it is fabulous; and that man &s;tands in the &s;ame relative condition with his Maker he ever did &s;tand &s;ince man exi&s;ted; and that it is his greate&s;t con&s;ola|tion to think &s;o.</P>
<P>Let him believe this, and he will live more con&s;i&s;tently and morally than by any other &s;y&s;tem. It is by his being taught to contemplate him&s;elf as an out-law, as an out|ca&s;t, as a beggar, as a mumper, as one thrown, as it were, on a dunghill, at an im|men&s;e di&s;tance from his Creator, and who mu&s;t make his approaches by creeping and cringing to intermediate beings, that he con|ceives either a contemptuous di&s;regard for every thing under the name of religion, or becomes indifferent, or turns, what he calls, devout. In the latter ca&s;e, he con&s;umes his
<PB N="44" REF="46">life in grief, or the affectation of it. His prayers are reproaches. His humility is in|gratitude. He calls him&s;elf a worm, and the fertile earth a dunghill; and all the ble&s;|&s;ings of life by the thankle&s;s name of vani|ties. He de&s;pi&s;es the choice&s;t gift of God to man, the GIFT OF REASON; and having endeavoured to force upon him&s;elf the belief of a &s;y&s;tem again&s;t which rea&s;on revolts, he ungratefully calls it <HI>human rea&s;on,</HI> as if man could give rea&s;on to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Yet with all this &s;trange appearance of humility, and this contempt for human rea|&s;on, he ventures into the bolde&s;t pre&s;ump|tions. He finds fault with every thing. His &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is never &s;atisfied; his ingratitude is never at an end. He takes on him&s;elf to direct the Almighty what to do, even in the government of the univer&s;e. He prays dic|tatorially. When it is &s;un-&s;hine, he prays for rain, and when it is rain, he prays for &s;un-&s;hine. He follows the &s;ame idea in every thing that he prays for; for what is the amount of all his prayers, but an attempt to make the Almighty change his mind, and
<PB N="45" REF="47">act otherwi&s;e than he does. It is as if he were to &s;ay&mdash;thou knowe&s;t not &s;o well as I.</P>
<P>But &s;ome perhaps will &s;ay, Are we to have no word of God&mdash;No revelation? I an&s;wer yes. There is a word of God; there is a revelation.</P>
<P>THE WORD OF GOD IS THE CREATION WE BEHOLD: And it is in <HI>this word,</HI> which no human invention can counterfeit or alter, that God &s;peaketh univer&s;ally to man.</P>
<P>Human language is local and changeable, and is therefore incapable of being u&s;ed as the means of unchangeable and univer&s;al in|formation. The idea that God &s;ent Je&s;us Chri&s;t to publi&s;h, as they &s;ay, the glad tidings to all nations, from one end of the earth unto the other, is con&s;i&s;tent only with the ignorance of tho&s;e who know nothing of the extent of the world, and who believed, as tho&s;e world-&s;aviours believed, and con|tinued to believe, for &s;everal centuries (and that in contradiction to the di&s;coveries of phi|lo&s;ophers, and the experience of navigators)
<PB N="46" REF="48">that the earth was flat like a trencher; and that a man might walk to the end of it.</P>
<P>But how was Je&s;us Chri&s;t to make any thing known to all nations? He could &s;peak but one language, which was Hebrew; and there are in the world &s;everal hundred lan|guages. Scarcely any two nations &s;peak the &s;ame language, or under&s;tand each other; and as to tran&s;lations, every man who knows any thing of languages, knows that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to tran&s;late from one language into another not only without lo&s;ing a great part of the original, but frequently of mi&s;taking the &s;en&s;e: and be&s;ides all this, the art of printing was wholly unknown at the time Chri&s;t lived.</P>
<P>It is always nece&s;&s;ary that the means that are to accompli&s;h any end, be equal to the accompli&s;hment of that end, or the end can|not be accompli&s;hed. It is in this, that the difference between finite and infinite power and wi&s;dom di&s;covers it&s;elf. Man frequently fails in accompli&s;hing his end, from a natu|ral inability of the power to the purpo&s;e; and frequently from the want of wi&s;dom to
<PB N="47" REF="49">apply power properly. But it is impo&s;&s;ible for infinite power and wi&s;dom to fail as man faileth. The means it u&s;eth are always equal to the end: but human language, more e&s;pecially as there is not an univer&s;al lan|guage, is incapable of being u&s;ed as an uni|ver&s;al means of unchangeable and uniform information; and therefore it is not the means that God u&s;eth in manife&s;ting him&s;elf univer&s;ally to man.</P>
<P>It is only in the CREATION that all our ideas and conceptions of a <HI>word of God</HI> can unite. The creation &s;peaketh an univer&s;al language, independently of human &s;peech or human language, multiplied and various as they be. It is an ever exi&s;ting original, which every man can read. It cannot be forged; it cannot be counterfeited; it cannot be lo&s;t; it cannot be altered; it cannot be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. It does not depend upon the will of man whether it &s;hall be publi&s;hed or not; it pub|li&s;hes it&s;elf from one end of the earth to the other. It preaches to all nations and to all worlds; and this <HI>word of God</HI> reveals to man all that is nece&s;&s;ary for man to know of God.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50">Do we want to contemplate his power? We &s;ee it in the immen&s;ity of the creation. Do we want to contemplate his wi&s;dom? We &s;ee it in the unchangeable order by which the incomprehen&s;ible Whole is governed. Do we want to contemplate his munificence? We &s;ee it in the abundance with which he fills the earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We &s;ee it in his not withhold|ing that abundance even from the unthank|ful. In fine, do we want to know what God is? Search not the book called the &s;cripture, which any human hand might make, but the &s;cripture called the Creation.</P>
<P>The only idea man can affix to the name of God, is, that of a <HI>fir&s;t cau&s;e,</HI> the cau&s;e of all things. And incomprehen&s;ibly difficult as it is for man to conceive what a fir&s;t cau&s;e is, he arrives at the belief of it, from the ten-fold greater difficulty of di&s;believing it. It is difficult beyond de&s;cription to con|ceive that &s;pace can have no end; but it is more difficult to conceive an end. It is dif|ficult beyond the power of man to conceive an eternal duration of what we call time; but it is more impo&s;&s;ible to conceive a time
<PB N="49" REF="51">when there &s;hall be no time. In like man|ner of rea&s;oning, every thing we behold carries in it&s;elf the internal evidence that it did not make it&s;elf. Every man is an evi|dence to him&s;elf, that he did not make him&s;elf; neither could his father make him|&s;elf, nor his grandfather, nor any of his race; neither could any tree, plant, or ani|mal, make it&s;elf: and it is the conviction ari&s;ing from this evidence, that carries us on, as it were, by nece&s;&s;ity, to the belief of a fir&s;t cau&s;e eternally exi&s;ting, of a nature totally different to any material exi&s;tence we know of, and by the power of which all things exi&s;t, and this fir&s;t cau&s;e man calls God.</P>
<P>It is only by the exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, that man can di&s;cover God. Take away that rea&s;on, and he would be incapable of un|der&s;tanding any thing; and, in this ca&s;e, it would be ju&s;t as con&s;i&s;tent to read even the book called the Bible, to a hor&s;e as to a man. How then is it that tho&s;e people pretend to reject rea&s;on?</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52">Almo&s;t the only parts in the book, called the Bible, that convey to us any idea of God, are &s;ome chapters in Job, and the 19th p&s;alm. I recollect no other. Tho&s;e parts are true <HI>dei&s;tical</HI> compo&s;itions; for they treat of the <HI>Deity</HI> through his works. They take the book of Creation as the word of God; they refer to no other book; and all the inferences they make are drawn from that volume.</P>
<P>I in&s;ert, in this place, the 19th p&s;alm, as paraphra&s;ed into Engli&s;h ver&s;e, by Addi&s;on. I recollect not the pro&s;e, and where I write this I have not the opportunity of &s;eeing it.</P>

<L>Soon as the evening &s;hades prevail,</L>

<L>Repeats the &s;tory of her birth.</L>

<L>And utter forth a glorious voice;</L>
<L>For ever &s;inging as they &s;hine,</L>
<L>THE HAND THAT MADE US IS DIVINE.</L></Q>
<P>What more does man want to know than that the hand, or power, that made the&s;e things is divine, is omnipotent. Let him believe this, with the force it is impo&s;|&s;ible to repel if he permits his rea&s;on to act, and his rule of moral life will follow of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The allu&s;ions in Job have all of them the &s;ame tendency with this p&s;alm; that of deducing or proving a truth, that would be otherwi&s;e unknown, from truths already known.</P>
<P>I recollect not enough of the pa&s;&s;ages in Job to in&s;ert them correctly: but there is one that occurs to me that is applicable to
<PB N="52" REF="54">the &s;ubject I am &s;peaking upon. <Q>Can&s;t thou by &s;earching find out God; can&s;t thou find out the Almighty to perfection.</Q></P>
<P>I know not how the printers have pointed this pa&s;&s;age, for I keep no Bible: but it contains two di&s;tinct que&s;tions that admits of di&s;tinct an&s;wers.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Can&s;t thou by <HI>&s;earching</HI> find out God? Yes. Becau&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, I know I did not make my&s;elf, and yet I have exi&s;tence; and by <HI>&s;earching</HI> into the nature of other things, I find that no other thing could make it&s;elf; and yet millions of other things exi&s;t; therefore it is, that I know, by po&s;itive conclu&s;ion re&s;ulting from this &s;earch, that there is a power &s;uperior to all tho&s;e things, and that power is God.</P>
<P>Secondly, Can&s;t thou find out the Al|mighty to <HI>perfection?</HI> No. Not only be|cau&s;e the power and wi&s;dom he has mani|fe&s;ted in the &s;tructure of the creation that I behold, is to me incomprehen&s;ible; but becau&s;e even this manife&s;tation, great as it is, is probably but a &s;mall di&s;play of that
<PB N="53" REF="55">immen&s;ity of power and wi&s;dom, by which millions of other worlds, to me invi&s;ible by their di&s;tance, were created and continue to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>It is evident that both the&s;e que&s;tions were put to the rea&s;on of the per&s;on to whom they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been ad|dre&s;&s;ed; and it is only by admitting the fir&s;t que&s;tion to be an&s;wered affirmatively, that the &s;econd could follow. It would have been unnece&s;&s;ary, and even ab&s;urd, to have put a &s;econd que&s;tion more difficult than the fir&s;t, if the fir&s;t que&s;tion had been an&s;wered negatively. The two que&s;tions have differ|ent objects, the fir&s;t refers to the exi&s;tence of God, the &s;econd to his attributes. Rea&s;on can di&s;cover the one, but it falls infinitely &s;hort in di&s;covering the whole of the other.</P>
<P>I recollect not a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age in all the writings a&s;cribed to the men, called apo&s;tles, that convey any idea of what God is. Tho&s;e writings are chiefly controver&s;ial; and the gloomine&s;s of the &s;ubject they dwell upon, that of a man dying in agony on a cro&s;s, is better &s;uited to the gloomy genius of a monk
<PB N="54" REF="56">in a cell, by whom it is not impo&s;&s;ible they were written, than to any man breathing the open air of the creation. The only pa&s;&s;age that occurs to me, that has any reference to the works of God, by which only his power and wi&s;dom can be known, is related to have been &s;poken by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as a remedy again&s;t di&s;tru&s;tful care. "Behold the lilies of the field, they toil not, neither do they &s;pin." This, however, is far inferior to the allu|&s;ions in Job, and in the nineteenth p&s;alm; but it is &s;imilar in idea, and the mode&s;ty of the imagery is corre&s;pondent to the mo|de&s;ty of the man.</P>
<P>As to the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith, it ap|pears to me as a &s;pecies of athei&s;m; a &s;ort of religious denial of God. It profe&s;&s;es to be|lieve in a man rather than in God. It is a compound made up chiefly of mani&s;m with but little dei&s;m, and is as near to athei&s;m as twilight is to darkne&s;s. It introduces be|tween man and his Maker an opaque body which it calls a redeemer; as the moon in|troduces her opaque &s;elf between the earth and the &s;un, and it produces by this means a religious or an irreligious eclip&s;e of light.
<PB N="55" REF="57">It has put the whole orbit of rea&s;on into &s;hade.</P>
<P>The effect of this ob&s;curity has been that of turning every thing up&s;ide down, and repre&s;enting it in rever&s;e; and among the revolutions it has thus magically produced, it has made a revolution in Theology.</P>
<P>That which is now called natural philo|&s;ophy, embracing the whole circle of &s;ci|ence, of which a&s;tronomy occupies the chief place, is the &s;tudy of the works of God and of the power and wi&s;dom of God in his works, and is the true theology.</P>
<P>As to the theology that is now &s;tudied in its place, it is the &s;tudy of human opinions and of human fancies <HI>concerning</HI> God. It is not the &s;tudy of God him&s;elf in the works that he has made, but in the works or writ|ings that man has made; and it is not among the lea&s;t of the mi&s;chiefs that the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem has done to the world, that it has abandoned the original and beautiful &s;y&s;tem of theology, like a beautiful innocent to di&s;tre&s;s and reproach, to make room for the hag of &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="58">The book of Job, and the 19th p&s;alm, which even the church admits to be more ancient than the chronological order in which they &s;tand in the book called the Bible, are theological orations conformable to the ori|ginal &s;y&s;tem of theology. The internal evi|dence of tho&s;e orations proves to a demon|&s;tration, that the &s;tudy and contemplation of the works of creation, and of the power and wi&s;dom of God revealed and manife&s;ted in tho&s;e works, made a great part of the religious devotion of the times in which they were written; and it was this devo|tional &s;tudy and contemplation that led to the di&s;covery of the principles upon which, what are now called Sciences, are e&s;tabli&s;h|ed; and it is to the di&s;covery of the&s;e prin|ciples that almo&s;t all the Arts that contri|bute to the convenience of human life, owe their exi&s;tence. Every principal art has &s;ome &s;cience for its parent, though the per|&s;on who mechanically performs the work does not always, and but very &s;eldom, per|ceive the connection.</P>
<P>It is a fraud of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem to call the &s;ciences <HI>human inventions;</HI> it is only the
<PB N="57" REF="59">application of them that is human. Every &s;cience has for its ba&s;is a &s;y&s;tem of principles as fixed and unalterable as tho&s;e by which the univer&s;e is regulated and governed. Man cannot make principles; he can only di&s;cover them:</P>
<P>For example. Every per&s;on who looks at an almanack &s;ees an account when an eclip&s;e will take place, and he &s;ees al&s;o that it never fails to take place according to the account there given. This &s;hews that man is acquainted with the laws by which the heavenly bodies move. But it would be &s;omething wor&s;e than ignorance, were any church on earth to &s;ay, that tho&s;e laws are an human invention.</P>
<P>It would al&s;o be ignorance, or &s;omething wor&s;e, to &s;ay, that the &s;cientific principles, by the aid of which man is enabled to cal|culate and fore-know when an eclip&s;e will take place, are an human invention. Man cannot invent any thing that is eternal and immutable; and the &s;cientific principles he employs for this purpo&s;e, mu&s;t, and are, of nece&s;&s;ity, as eternal and immutable as the
<PB N="58" REF="60">laws by which the heavenly bodies move, or they could not be u&s;ed as they are, to a&s;cer|tain the time when, and the manner how, an eclip&s;e will take place.</P>
<P>The &s;cientific principles that man em|ploys to obtain the fore-knowledge of an eclip&s;e, or of any thing el&s;e relating to the motion of the heavenly bodies, are contained chiefly in that part of &s;cience that is called trigonometry, or the properties of a triangle, which, when applied to the &s;tudy of the heavenly bodies, is called a&s;tronomy; when applied to direct the cour&s;e of a &s;hip on the ocean, it is called navigation; when applied to the con&s;truction of figures drawn by a rule and compa&s;s, it is called geometry; when applied to the con&s;truction of plans of edifices, it is called architecture; when applied to the mea&s;urement of any portion of the &s;urface of the earth, it is called land|&s;urveying. In fine, it is the &s;oul of &s;cience. It is an eternal truth: it contains the <HI>mathe|matical demon&s;tration</HI> of which man &s;peaks, and the extent of its u&s;es are unknown.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61">It may be &s;aid, that man can make or draw a triangle, and therefore a triangle is an human invention.</P>
<P>But the triangle, when drawn, is no other than the image of the principle: it is a deli|neation to the eye, and from thence to the mind, of a principle that would otherwi&s;e be imperceptible. The triangle does not make the principle, any more than a candle taken into a room that was dark, makes the chairs and tables that before were invi&s;ible. All the properties of a triangle exi&s;t inde|pendently of the figure, and exi&s;ted before any triangle was drawn or thought of by man. Man had no more to do in the for|mation of tho&s;e properties, or principles, than he had to do in making the laws by which the heavenly bodies move; and therefore the one mu&s;t have the &s;ame divine origin as the other.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner as it may be &s;aid, that man can make a triangle, &s;o al&s;o may it be &s;aid, he can make the mechanical in|&s;trument, called a lever. But the principle by which the lever acts, is a thing di&s;tinct
<PB N="60" REF="62">from the in&s;trument, and would exi&s;t if the in&s;trument did not: it attaches it&s;elf to the in&s;trument after it is made; the in&s;trument therefore can act no otherwi&s;e than it does act; neither can all the effort of human in|vention make it act otherwi&s;e. That which, in all &s;uch ca&s;es, man calls the <HI>effect,</HI> is no other than the principle it&s;elf rendered per|ceptible to the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>Since then man cannot make principles, from whence did he gain a knowledge of them, &s;o as to be able to apply them, not only to things on earth, but to a&s;certain the motion of bodies &s;o immen&s;ely di&s;tant from him as all the heavenly bodies are? From whence, I a&s;k, <HI>could</HI> he gain that knowledge, but from the &s;tudy of the true theology?</P>
<P>It is the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e that has taught this knowledge to man. That &s;truc|ture is an ever exi&s;ting exhibition of every principle upon which every part of mathe|matical &s;cience is founded. The offspring of this &s;cience is mechanics; for mechanics is no other than the principles of &s;cience ap|plied practically. The man who propor|tions
<PB N="61" REF="63">the &s;everal parts of a mill, u&s;es the &s;ame &s;cientific principles, as if he had the power of con&s;tructing an univer&s;e: but as he cannot give to matter that invi&s;ible agency, by which all the component parts of the im|men&s;e machine of the univer&s;e have influ|ence upon each other, and act in motional uni&s;on together without any apparent contact, and to which man has given the name of at|traction, gravitation, and repul&s;ion, he &s;up|plies the place of that agency by the humble imitation of teeth and cogs. All the parts of man's microco&s;m mu&s;t vi&s;ibly touch. But could he gain a knowledge of that agency, &s;o as to be able to apply it in practice, we might then &s;ay, that another <HI>canonical book</HI> of the word of God had been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>If man could alter the properties of the lever, &s;o al&s;o could he alter the properties of the triangle: for a lever (taking that &s;ort of lever, which is called a &s;teel-yard for the &s;ake of explanation) forms, when in motion, a triangle. The line it de&s;cends from, (one point of that line being in the fulcrum) the line it de&s;cends to, and the chord of the arc, which the end of the lever de&s;cribes
<PB N="62" REF="64">in the air, are the three &s;ides of a triangle. The other arm of the lever de&s;cribes al&s;o a triangle; and the corre&s;ponding &s;ides of tho&s;e two triangles, calculated &s;cientifically or mea&s;ured geometrically; and al&s;o the &s;ines, tangents, and &s;ecants generated from the angles, and geometrically mea&s;ured, have the &s;ame proportions to each other, as the different weights have that will balance each other on the lever, leaving the weight of the lever out of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be &s;aid that man can make a wheel and axis, that he can put wheels of different magnitudes together, and pro|duce a mill. Still the ca&s;e comes back to the &s;ame point, which is, that he did not make the principle that gives the wheels tho&s;e powers. That principle is as unal|terable as in the former ca&s;es, or rather it is the &s;ame principle under a different ap|pearance to the eye.</P>
<P>The power that two wheels, of different magnitudes, have upon each other, is in the &s;ame proportion as if the &s;emi-diameter of the two wheels were joined together and

<P><PB N="65" REF="67">As the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith has made a revolution in theology, &s;o al&s;o has it made a revolution in the &s;tate of learning. That which is now called learning was not learn|ing originally. Learning does not con&s;i&s;t, as the &s;chools now make it con&s;i&s;t, in the knowledge of languages, but in the know|ledge of things to which language gives names.</P>
<P>The Greeks were a learned people; but learning with them, did not con&s;i&s;t in &s;peak|ing Greek, any more than in a Roman's &s;peaking Latin, or a Frenchman's &s;peaking French, or an Engli&s;hman's &s;peaking Eng|li&s;h. From what we know of the Greeks, it does not appear that they knew or &s;tudied any language but their own; and this was one cau&s;e of their becoming &s;o learned; it afforded them more time to apply them|&s;elves to better &s;tudies. The &s;chools of the Greeks were &s;chools of &s;cience and philo|&s;ophy, and not of languages: and it is in the knowledge of the things that &s;cience and philo&s;ophy teach, that learning con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="68">Almo&s;t all the &s;cientific learning that now exi&s;ts, came to us from the Greeks, or the people who &s;poke the Greek language. It therefore became nece&s;&s;ary to the people of other nations, who &s;poke a different lan|guage, that &s;ome among them &s;hould learn the Greek language, in order that the learn|ing the Greeks had, might be made known in tho&s;e nations, by tran&s;lating the Greek books of &s;cience and philo&s;ophy into the mother tongue of each nation.</P>
<P>The &s;tudy therefore of the Greek lan|guage, (and in the &s;ame manner for the Latin) was no other than the drudgery bu&s;i|ne&s;s of a lingui&s;t; and the language thus obtained, was no other than the means, or as it were, the tools, employed to obtain the learning the Greeks had. It made no part of the learning it&s;elf; and was &s;o di&s;tinct from it, as to make it exceeding probable, that the per&s;ons who had &s;tudied Greek &s;uf|ficiently to tran&s;late tho&s;e works, &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as Euclid's Elements, did not un|der&s;tand any of the learning the works con|tained.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69">As there is now nothing new to be learned from the dead languages, all the u&s;eful books being already tran&s;lated, the languages are become u&s;ele&s;s, and the time expended in teaching and in learning them is wa&s;ted. So far as the &s;tudy of languages may con|tribute to the progre&s;s and communication of knowledge (for it has nothing to do with the <HI>creation</HI> of knowledge) it is only in the living languages that new knowledge is to be found: and certain it is, that, in general, a youth will learn more of a living language in one year, than of a dead language in &s;even; and it is but &s;eldem that the teacher knows much of it him&s;elf. The difficulty of learning the dead languages does not ari&s;e from any &s;uperior ab&s;tru&s;ene&s;s in the lan|guages them&s;elves, but in their <HI>being dead,</HI> and the pronunciation entirely lo&s;t. It would be the &s;ame thing with any other lan|guage when it becomes dead. The be&s;t Greek lingui&s;t, that now exi&s;ts, does not under&s;tand Greek &s;o well as a Grecian plow|man did, or a Grecian milkmaid; and the &s;ame for the Latin, compared with a plow|man or a milkmaid of the Romans; and with re&s;pect to pronunciation, and idiom,
<PB N="68" REF="70">not &s;o well as the cows that &s;he milked. It would therefore be advantageous to the &s;tate of learning, to aboli&s;h the &s;tudy of the dead languages, and to make learning con&s;i&s;t, as it originally did, in &s;cientific knowledge.</P>
<P>The apology that is &s;ometimes made for continuing to teach the dead languages is, that they are taught at a time when a child is not capable of exerting any other mental faculty than that of memory. But this is altogether erroneous. The human mind has a natural di&s;po&s;ition to &s;cientific knowledge, and to the things connected with it. The fir&s;t and favourite amu&s;ement of a child, even before it begins to play, is that of imi|tating the works of man. It builds hou&s;es with cards or &s;ticks; it navigates the little ocean of a bowl of water with a paper boat; or dams the &s;tream of a gutter, and contrives &s;omething which it calls a mill; and it in|tere&s;ts it&s;elf in the fate of its works with a care that re&s;embles affection. It afterwards goes to &s;chool, where its genius is killed by the barren &s;tudy of a dead language, and the philo&s;opher is lo&s;t in the lingui&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="71">But the apology that is now made for continuing to teach the dead languages, could not be the cau&s;e at fir&s;t of cutting down learning to the narrow and humble &s;phere of lingui&s;try; the cau&s;e, therefore, mu&s;t be &s;ought for el&s;ewhere. In all re|&s;earches of this kind, the be&s;t evidence that can be produced, is the internal evidence the thing carries with it&s;elf, and the evidence of circum&s;tances that unites with it, both of which, in this ca&s;e, are not difficult to be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Putting then a&s;ide, as matter of di&s;tinct con&s;ideration, the outrage offered to the moral ju&s;tice of God, by &s;uppo&s;ing him to make the innocent &s;uffer for the guilty, and al&s;o the loo&s;e morality and low contrivance of &s;uppo&s;ing him to change him&s;elf into the &s;hape of a man, in order to make an excu&s;e to him&s;elf for not executing his &s;up|po&s;ed &s;entence upon Adam; putting, I &s;ay, tho&s;e things a&s;ide, as matter of di&s;tinct con|&s;ideration, it is certain, that what is called the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith, including in it the whim&s;ical account of the creation; the &s;trange &s;tory of Eve, the &s;nake, and the ap|ple;
<PB N="70" REF="72">the amphibious idea of a man-god; the corporeal idea of the death of a god; the mythological idea of a family of gods; and the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of arithmetic, that three are one, and one is three, are all irre|concileable, not only to the divine gift of rea&s;on that God has given to man, but to the knowledge that man gains of the power and wi&s;dom of God, by the aid of the &s;ci|ences, and by &s;tudying the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e that God has made.</P>
<P>The &s;etters up, therefore, and the advo|cates of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith, could not but fore&s;ee that the continually pro|gre&s;&s;ive knowledge that man would gain by the aid of &s;cience, of the power and wi&s;dom of God, manife&s;ted in the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e, and in all the works of creation, would militate again&s;t, and call into que&s;|tion, the truth of their &s;y&s;tem of faith; and therefore it became nece&s;&s;ary to their pur|po&s;e to cut learning down to a &s;ize le&s;s dan|gerous to their project, and this they effected by re&s;tricting the idea of learning to the dead &s;tudy of dead languages.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="73">They not only rejected the &s;tudy of &s;cience out of the chri&s;tian &s;chools, but they per&s;e|cuted it; and it is only within about the la&s;t two centuries that the &s;tudy has been re|vived. So late as 1610 Galileo, a Florentine, di&s;covered and introduced the u&s;e of tele|&s;copes, and by applying them to ob&s;erve the motions and appearances of the heavenly bodies, afforded additional means for a&s;cer|taining the true &s;tructure of the univer&s;e. In&s;tead of being e&s;teemed for the&s;e di&s;cove|ries, he was &s;entenced to renounce them, or the opinions re&s;ulting from them, as a dam|nable here&s;y. And prior to that time Vigi|lius was condemned to be burned for a&s;&s;ert|ing the antipodes, or in other words, that the earth was a globe, and habitable in every part where there was land; yet the truth of this is now too well known even to be told.</P>
<P>If the belief of errors not morally bad did no mi&s;chief, it would make no part of the moral duty of man to oppo&s;e and remove them. There was no moral ill in believing the earth was flat like a trencher, any more than there was moral virtue in believing it was round like a globe; neither was there
<PB N="72" REF="74">any moral ill in believing that the Creator made no other world than this, any more than there was moral virtue in believing that he made millions, and that the infinity of &s;pace is filled with worlds. But when a &s;y&s;|tem of religion is made to grow out of a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem of creation that is not true, and to unite it&s;elf therewith in a manner almo&s;t in&s;eparable therefrom, the ca&s;e a&s;&s;umes an entirely different ground. It is then that errors, not morally bad, become fraught with the &s;ame mi&s;chiefs as if they were. It is then that the truth, though otherwi&s;e indif|ferent it&s;elf, becomes an e&s;&s;ential, by becom|ing the criterion, that either confirms by corre&s;ponding evidence, or denies by con|tradictory evidence, the reality of the reli|gion it&s;elf. In this view of the ca&s;e it is the moral duty of man to obtain every po&s;|&s;ible evidence, that the &s;tructure of the heathens, or any other part of creation affords, with re&s;pect to &s;y&s;tems of religion. But this, the &s;upporters or partizans of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, as if dreading the re&s;ult, ince&s;&s;antly oppo&s;ed, and not only rejected the &s;ciences, but per&s;ecuted the profe&s;&s;ors. Had Newton or De&s;cartes lived three or
<PB N="73" REF="75">four hundred years ago, and pur&s;ued their &s;tudies as they did, it is mo&s;t probable they would not have lived to fini&s;h them; and had Franklin drawn lightning from the clouds at the &s;ame time, it would have been at the hazard of expiring for it in flames.</P>
<P>Latter times have laid all the blame upon the Goths and Vandals, but, however un|willing the partizans of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem may be to believe or to acknowledge it, it is neverthele&s;s true, that the age of igno|rance commenced with the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem. There was more knowledge in the world before that period than for many centuries afterwards; and as to religious knowledge, the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, as already &s;aid, was only another &s;pecies of mythology; and the mythology to which it &s;ucceeded, was a cor|ruption of an ancient &s;y&s;tem of thei&s;m.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for us now to know at what time the heathen mythology began; but it is certain, from the internal evidence that it carries, that it did not begin in the &s;ame &s;tate or condition in which it ended. All the gods of that mythology, except Saturn, were of modern invention. The &s;uppo&s;ed reign of Saturn was prior to that which is called the heathen mythology, and was &s;o far a &s;pecies of thei&s;m that it admitted the belief of only one God. Saturn is &s;uppo&s;ed to have abdicated the government in favour of his three &s;ons and one daugh|ter, Jupiter, Pluto, Neptune and Juno: after this, thou|&s;ands of other gods and demi-gods were imaginarily created, and the calendar of gods increa&s;ed as fa&s;t as the calendar of &s;aints, and the calendar of courts have increa&s;ed &s;ince.</P>
<P>All the corruptions that have taken place in theology, and in religion, have been produced by admitting of what man calls <HI>revealed religion.</HI> The mythologi&s;ts pre|tended to more revealed religion than the chri&s;tians do. They had their oracles and their prie&s;ts, who were &s;up|po&s;ed to receive and deliver the word of God verbally on almo&s;t all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Since then all corruptions, down from Moloch to modern prede&s;tinariani&s;m, and the human &s;acrifices of the heathens to the chri&s;tian &s;acrifice of the Creator, have been produced by admitting what is called <HI>revealed religion,</HI> the mo&s;t effectual means to prevent all &s;uch evils and impo&s;itions, and is not to admit of any other revelation than that which is manife&s;ted in the book of Creation; and to contemplate the Creation, as the only true and real word of God that ever did or ever will exi&s;t, and that every thing el&s;e, called the word of God is fable and impo&s;ition.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76">It is owing to this long interregnum of &s;cience, <HI>and to no other cau&s;e,</HI> that we have now to look back through a va&s;t cha&s;m of
<PB N="75" REF="77">many hundred years to the re&s;pectable cha|racters we call the ancients. Had the pro|gre&s;&s;ion of knowledge gone on proportion|ably with the &s;tock that before exi&s;ted, that cha&s;m would have been filled up with cha|racters ri&s;ing &s;uperior in knowledge to each other; and tho&s;e ancients, we now &s;o much admire, would have appeared re&s;pectably in the back ground of the &s;cene. But the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem laid all wa&s;te; and if we take our &s;tand about the beginning of the &s;ix|teenth century, we look back through that long cha&s;m, to the times of the ancients, as over a va&s;t &s;andy de&s;art, in which not a &s;hrub appears to intercept the vi&s;ion to the fertile hills beyond.</P>
<P>It is an incon&s;i&s;tency, &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to be credited, that any thing &s;hould exi&s;t under the name of a <HI>religion,</HI> that held it to be <HI>irreligious</HI> to &s;tudy and contemplate the &s;truc|ture of the univer&s;e that God had made. But the fact is too well e&s;tabli&s;hed to be denied. The event that &s;erved more than any other, to break the fir&s;t link in this long chain of de&s;potic ignorance, is that known by the name of the reformation by Luther.
<PB N="76" REF="78">From that time, though it does not appear to have made any part of the intention of Luther, or of tho&s;e who are called reformers, the Sciences began to revive, and Liberality, their natural a&s;&s;ociate, began to appear. This was the only public good the reformation did; for with re&s;pect to religious good, it might as well not have taken place. The mythology &s;till continued the &s;ame; and a multiplicity of national popes grew out of the downfal of the Pope of Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn, from the internal evidence of things, the cau&s;e that produced a change in the &s;tate of learning, and the motive for &s;ub&s;tituting the &s;tudy of the dead languages in the place of the Sciences, I proceed, in addition to the &s;everal ob&s;erva|tions already made in the former part of this work, to compare, or rather to confront, the evidence that the &s;tructure of the uni|ver&s;e affords, with the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of religion. But as I cannot begin this part better than by referring to the ideas that occurred to me at an early part of life, and which I doubt not have occurred in &s;ome degree to almo&s;t every other per&s;on at one
<PB N="77" REF="79">time or other, I &s;hall &s;tate what tho&s;e ideas were, and add thereto &s;uch other matter as &s;hall ari&s;e out of the &s;ubject, giving to the whole, by way of preface, a &s;hort intro|duction.</P>
<P>My father being of the quaker profe&s;&s;ion, it was my good fortune to have an exceed|ingly good moral education, and a tolerable &s;tock of u&s;eful learning. Though I went to the grammar &s;chool,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame &s;chool, Thetford in Norfolk, that the pre&s;ent coun&s;ellor Mingay went to, and under the &s;ame ma&s;ter.</NOTE> I did not learn Latin, not only becau&s;e I had no inclination to learn languages, but becau&s;e of the objection the quakers have again&s;t the books in which the language is taught. But this did not prevent me from being acquainted with the &s;ubjects of all the Latin books u&s;ed in the &s;chool.</P>
<P>The natural bent of my mind was to &s;ci|ence. I had &s;ome turn, and I believe &s;ome talent for poetry; but this I rather repre&s;&s;ed than encouraged, as leading too much into
<PB N="78" REF="80">the field of imagination. As &s;oon as I was able I purcha&s;ed a pair of globes, and at|tended the philo&s;ophical lectures of Martin and Fergu&s;on, and became afterwards ac|quainted with Dr. Bevis, of the &s;ociety, called the Royal Society, then living in the Temple, and an excellent a&s;tronomer.</P>
<P>I had no di&s;po&s;ition for what was called politics. It pre&s;ented to my mind no other idea than is contained in the word Joc|key&s;hip. When, therefore, I turned my thoughts towards matters of government, I had to form a &s;y&s;tem for my&s;elf, that ac|corded with the moral and philo&s;ophic prin|ciples in which I had been educated. I &s;aw, or at lea&s;t I thought I &s;aw, a va&s;t &s;cene open|ing it&s;elf to the world in the affairs of Ame|rica; and it appeared to me, that unle&s;s the Americans changed the plan they were then pur&s;uing, with re&s;pect to the government of England, and declare them&s;elves indepen|dent, they would not only involve them|&s;elves in a multiplicity of new difficulties, but &s;hut out the pro&s;pect that was then offer|ing it&s;elf to mankind through their means. It was from the&s;e motives that I publi&s;hed
<PB N="79" REF="81">the work known by the name of <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> which is the fir&s;t work I ever did pub|li&s;h: and &s;o far as I can judge of my&s;elf, I believe I never &s;hould have been known in the world as an author on any &s;ubject what|ever, had it not been for the affairs of Ame|rica. I wrote <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> the latter end of the year 1775, and publi&s;hed it the fir&s;t of January 1776. Independence was declared the fourth of July following.</P>
<P>Any per&s;on who has made ob&s;ervations on the &s;tate and progre&s;s of the human mind, by ob&s;erving his own, cannot but have ob|&s;erved, that there are two di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es of what are called Thoughts: tho&s;e that we produce in our&s;elves by reflection and the act of thinking, and tho&s;e that bolt into the mind of their own accord. I have always made it a rule to treat tho&s;e voluntary vi&s;it|ors with civility, taking care to examine, as well as I was able, if they were worth enter|taining; and it is from them I have acquired almo&s;t all the knowledge that I have. As to the learning that any per&s;on gains from &s;chool education, it &s;erves only, like a &s;mall capital, to put him in the way of beginning
<PB N="80" REF="82">learning for him&s;elf afterwards. Every per|&s;on of learning is finally his own teacher; the rea&s;on of which is, that principles, being of a di&s;tinct quality to circum&s;tances, cannot be impre&s;&s;ed upon the memory. Their place of mental re&s;idence is the under&s;tanding, and they are never &s;o la&s;ting as when they begin by conception. Thus much for the intro|ductory part.</P>
<P>From the time I was capable of conceiv|ing an idea, and acting upon it by reflection, I either doubted the truth of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, or thought it to be a &s;trange affair; I &s;carcely new which it was: but I well re|member, when about &s;even or eight years of age, hearing a &s;ermon read by a relation of mine, who was a great devotee of the church, upon the &s;ubject of what is called <HI>Redemption by the death of the Son of God.</HI> After the &s;ermon was ended I went into the garden, and as I was going down the garden &s;teps (for I perfectly recollect the &s;pot) I revolted at the recollection of what I had heard, and thought to my&s;elf that it was making God Almighty act like a pa&s;&s;ionate man that killed his &s;on when he could not
<PB N="81" REF="83">revenge him&s;elf any other way; and as I was &s;ure a man would be hanged that did &s;uch a thing, I could not &s;ee for what purpo&s;e they preached &s;uch &s;ermons. This was not one of tho&s;e kind of thoughts that had any thing in it of childi&s;h levity; it was to me a &s;eri|ous reflection ari&s;ing from the idea I had, that God was too good to do &s;uch an action, and al&s;o too almighty to be under any nece&s;|&s;ity of doing it. I believe in the &s;ame man|ner to this moment; and I moreover be|lieve, that any &s;y&s;tem of religion that has any thing in it that &s;hocks the mind of a child, cannot be a true &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>It &s;eems as if parents of the chri&s;tian pro|fe&s;&s;ion were a&s;hamed to tell their children any thing about the principles of their reli|gion. They &s;ometimes in&s;truct them in morals, and talk to them of the goodne&s;s of what they call Providence; for the chri&s;tian mythology has five deities: there is God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Gho&s;t, the God Providence, and the Godde&s;s Nature. But the chri&s;tian &s;tory of God the Father putting his &s;on to death, or employ|ing people to do it (for that is the plain lan|guage
<PB N="82" REF="84">of the &s;tory) cannot be told by a pa|rent to a child; and to tell him that it was done to make mankind happier and better is making the &s;tory &s;till wor&s;e, as if mankind could be improved by the example of mur|der; and to tell him that all this is a my&s;tery, is only making an excu&s;e for the incredibi|lity of it.</P>
<P>How different is this to the pure and &s;im|ple profe&s;&s;ion of Dei&s;m! The true dei&s;t has but one Deity; and his religion con&s;i&s;ts in contemplating the power, wi&s;dom, and be|nignity of the Deity in his works, and in endeavouring to imitate him in every thing moral, &s;cientifical, and mechanical.</P>
<P>The religion that approaches the neare&s;t of all others to true dei&s;m, in the moral and benign part thereof, is that profe&s;&s;ed by the quakers, but they have contracted them|&s;elves too much by leaving the works of God out of their &s;y&s;tem. Though I reve|rence their philanthropy, I cannot help &s;mi|ling at the conceit, that if the ta&s;te of a quaker could have been con&s;ulted at the cre|ation, what a &s;ilent and drab-coloured crea|tion
<PB N="83" REF="85">it would have been! Not a flower would have blo&s;&s;omed its gaities, nor a bird been permitted to &s;ing.</P>
<P>Quitting the&s;e reflections, I proceed to other matters. After I had made my&s;elf ma&s;ter of the u&s;e of the globes and of the orrery,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As this book may fall into the hands of per&s;ons who do not know what an orrery is, it is for their in|formation I add this note, as the name gives no idea of the u&s;es of the thing.

It is a machinery of clock-work repre&s;enting the univer&s;e in miniature: and in which the revolution of the earth round it|&s;elf and round the &s;un, the revolution of the moon round the earth, the revolution of the planets round the &s;un, their relative di&s;tances from the &s;un, as the center of the whole &s;y&s;tem, their relative di&s;tances from each other, and their different magnitudes, are repre&s;ented as they really exi&s;t in what we call the heavens.</NOTE> and conceived an idea of the in|finity of &s;pace, and of the eternal divi&s;ibility of matter, and obtained, at lea&s;t, a general knowledge of what is called natural philo|&s;ophy, I began to compare, or, as I have before &s;aid, to confront, the internal evi|dence tho&s;e things afford with the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86">Though it is not a direct article of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem that this world that we in|habit is the whole of the habitable creation, yet it is &s;o worked up therewith, from what is called the Mo&s;aic account of the creation, the &s;tory of Eve and the apple, and the counterpart of that &s;tory, the death of the Son of God, that to believe otherwi&s;e, that is, to believe that God created a plurality of worlds, at lea&s;t as numerous as what we call &s;tars, renders the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith at once little and ridiculous; and &s;cat|ters it in the mind like feathers in the air. The two beliefs cannot be held together in the &s;ame mind; and he who thinks that he believes both, has thought but little of either.</P>
<P>Though the belief of a plurality of worlds was familiar to the ancients, it is only within the la&s;t three centuries that the extent and dimen&s;ions of this globe that we inhabit, have been a&s;certained. Several ve&s;&s;els, fol|lowing the tract of the ocean, have &s;ailed entirely round the world, as a man may march in a circle, and come round by the contrary &s;ide of the circle to the &s;pot he &s;et out from. The circular dimen&s;ions of our
<PB N="85" REF="87">world in the wide&s;t part, as a man would mea&s;ure the wide&s;t round of an apple or a ball, is only twenty five thou&s;and and twenty Engli&s;h miles, reckoning &s;ixty nine miles and an half to an equatorial degree, and may be &s;ailed round in the &s;pace of about three years.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Allowing a &s;hip to &s;ail, on an average, three miles in an hour, &s;he would &s;ail entirely round the world in le&s;s than one year, if &s;he could &s;ail in a direct circle; but &s;he is obliged to follow the cour&s;e of the ocean.</NOTE></P>
<P>A world of this extent may, at fir&s;t thought, appear to us to be great; but if we compare it with the immen&s;ity of &s;pace in which it is &s;u&s;pended, like a bubble or a balloon in the air, it is infinitely le&s;s in pro|portion than the &s;malle&s;t grain of &s;and is to the &s;ize of the world, or the fine&s;t particle of dew to the whole ocean; and is therefore but &s;mall; and, as will be hereafter &s;hewn, is only <HI>one</HI> of a &s;y&s;tem of worlds, of which the univer&s;al creation is compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is not difficult to gain &s;ome faint idea of the immen&s;ity of &s;pace in which this and all the other worlds are &s;u&s;pended, if we follow a progre&s;&s;ion of ideas. When we think of the &s;ize or dimen&s;ions of a room,
<PB N="86" REF="88">our ideas limit them&s;elves to the walls, and there they &s;top. But when our eye, or our imagination, darts into &s;pace, that is, when it looks upward into what we call the open air, we cannot conceive any walls or boun|daries it can have; and if for the &s;ake of re&s;ting our ideas, we &s;uppo&s;e a boundary, the que&s;tion immediately renews it&s;elf, and a&s;ks, what is beyond that boundary? and in the &s;ame manner, what is beyond the next boundary? and &s;o on, till the fatigued ima|gination returns and &s;ays, <HI>there is no end.</HI> Certainly, then, the Creator was not pent for room when he made this world no larger than it is; and we have to &s;eek the rea&s;on in &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>If we take a &s;urvey of our own world, or rather of this, of which the Creator has given us the u&s;e, as our portion in the im|men&s;e &s;y&s;tem of creation, we find every part of it, the earth, the waters, and the air that &s;urround it, filled, and, as it were, crouded with life, down from the large&s;t animals that we know of, to the &s;malle&s;t in&s;ects the naked eye can behold, and from thence to others &s;till &s;maller, and totally invi&s;ible with|out
<PB N="87" REF="89">the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the micro&s;cope. Every tree, every plant, every leaf, &s;erves not only as an habitation, but as a world to &s;ome numerous race, till animal exi&s;tence becomes &s;o exceedingly refined, that the effluvia of a blade of gra&s;s would be food for thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>Since then no part of our earth is left unoccupied, why is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the immen&s;ity of &s;pace is a naked void, lying in eternal wa&s;te. There is room for mil|lions of worlds as large or larger than ours, and each of them millions of miles apart from each other.</P>
<P>Having now arrived at this point, if we carry our ideas only one thought further, we &s;hall &s;ee, perhaps, the true rea&s;on, at lea&s;t a very good rea&s;on for our happine&s;s, why the Creator, in&s;tead of making one im|men&s;e world, extending over an immen&s;e quantity of &s;pace, has preferred dividing that quantity of matter into &s;everal di&s;tinct and &s;eparate worlds, which we call planets, of which our earth is one. But before I explain my ideas upon this &s;ubject, it is nece&s;&s;ary (not for the &s;ake of tho&s;e that already know,
<PB N="88" REF="90">but for tho&s;e who do not) to &s;hew what the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e is.</P>
<P>That part of the univer&s;e, that is called the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem (meaning the &s;y&s;tem of worlds to which our earth belongs, and of which Sol, or in Engli&s;h language the Sun, is the center) con&s;i&s;ts, be&s;ides the Sun, or &s;ix di&s;tinct orbs, or planets, or worlds, be|&s;ides the &s;econdary bodies, called the &s;atel|lites, or moons, of which our earth has one that attends her in her annual revolution round the &s;un, in like manner as the other &s;atellites, or moons, attend the planets, or worlds, to which they &s;everally belong, as may be &s;een by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the tele&s;cope.</P>
<P>The Sun is the center, round which tho&s;e &s;ix worlds, or planets, revolve at different di&s;tances therefrom, and in circles concen|tric to each other. Each world keeps con|&s;tantly in nearly the &s;ame tract round the Sun, and continues, at the &s;ame time, turn|ing round it&s;elf, in nearly an upright po&s;ition, as a top turns round it&s;elf when it is &s;pinning on the ground, and leans a little &s;ideways.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="91">It is this leaning of the earth, (23&frac12; de|grees) that occa&s;ions &s;ummer and winter, and the different length of days and nights. If the earth turned round it&s;elf in a po&s;ition perpendicular to the plane or level of the circle it moves in round the Sun, as a top turns round when it &s;tands erect on the ground, the days and nights would be always of the &s;ame length, twelve hours day, and twelve hours night, and the &s;ea&s;on would be uniformly the &s;ame throughout the year.</P>
<P>Every time that a planet (our earth for example) turns round it&s;elf, it makes what we call day and night; and every time it goes entirely round the Sun, it makes what we call a year, con&s;equently our world turns three hundred and &s;ixty-five times round it&s;elf, in going once round the Sun.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;ed that the Sun went round the earth every twenty-four hours, made the &s;ame mi&s;take in idea, that a cook would do in fact, that &s;hould make the fire go round the meat, in&s;tead of the meat turning round it&s;elf towards the fire.</NOTE></P>
<P>The names that the ancients gave to tho&s;e &s;ix worlds, and which are &s;till called by the
<PB N="90" REF="92">&s;ame names, are Mercury, Venus, this world that we call ours, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. They appear larger to the eye than the &s;tars, being many million miles nearer to our earth than any of the &s;tars are. The planet Venus is that which is called the evening &s;tar, and &s;ometimes the morning &s;tar, as &s;he happens to &s;et after, or ri&s;e before the Sun, which, in either ca&s;e, is never more than three hours.</P>
<P>The Sun, as before &s;aid, being the center, the planet, or world, neare&s;t the Sun, is Mercury; his di&s;tance from the Sun is thirty-four million miles, and he moves round in a circle always at that di&s;tance from the Sun, as a top may be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;pin round in the tract in which a hor&s;e goes in a mill. The &s;econd world is Venus; &s;he is fifty-&s;even million miles di&s;tant from the Sun, and con&s;equently moves round in a cir|cle much greater than that of Mercury. The third world is this that we inhabit, and which is eighty-eight million miles di&s;tant from the Sun, and con&s;equently moves round in a circle greater than that of Venus. The
<PB N="91" REF="93">fourth world is Mars; he is di&s;tant from the Sun one hundred and thirty-four million miles, and con&s;equently moves round in a circle greater than that of our earth. The fifth is Jupiter; he is di&s;tant from the Sun five hundred and fifty-&s;even million miles, and con&s;equently moves round in a circle greater than that of Mars. The &s;ixth world is Saturn; he is di&s;tant from the Sun &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-three million miles, and con&s;equently moves round in a circle that &s;urrounds the circles or orbits of all the other worlds or planets.</P>
<P>The &s;pace, therefore, in the air, or in the immen&s;ity of &s;pace, that our &s;olar &s;y&s;tem takes up for the &s;everal worlds to perform their revolutions in round the &s;un, is of the extent in a &s;trait line of the whole diameter of the orbit or circle, in which Saturn moves round the Sun, which being double his di&s;|tance from the Sun, is fifteen hundred and twenty-&s;ix million miles; and its circular ex|tent is nearly five thou&s;and million, and its globical content is almo&s;t three thou&s;and
<PB N="92" REF="94">five hundred million times three thou&s;and five hundred million &s;quare miles.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If it &s;hould be a&s;ked, how can man know the&s;e things? I have one plain an&s;wer to give, which is, that man knows how to calculate an eclip&s;e, and al&s;o how to calculate, to a minute of time, when the planet Venus, in making her revolutions round the Sun, will come in a &s;trait line between our earth, and the Sun, and will appear to us about the &s;ize of a large pea pa&s;&s;ing acro&s;s the face of the Sun. This happens but twice in about an hundred years, at the di&s;tance of about eight years from each other, and has happened twice in our time, both of which were foreknown by calcula|tion. It can al&s;o be known when they will happen again for a thou&s;and years to come, or to any other portion of time. As, therefore, man could not be able to do tho&s;e things if he did not under&s;tand the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, and the manner in which the revolutions of the &s;everal planets or worlds are performed, the fact of calculating an eclip&s;e or a tran&s;it of Venus, is a proof in point that the knowledge exi&s;ts; and as to a few thou&s;and, or even a few million miles more or le&s;s, it makes &s;carcely any &s;en&s;ible difference in &s;uch immen&s;e di&s;tances.</NOTE></P>
<P>But this, immen&s;e as it is, is only one &s;y&s;tem of worlds. Beyond this, at a va&s;t di&s;tance into &s;pace, far beyond all power of calculation, are the &s;tars called the fixed &s;tars. They are called fixed, becau&s;e they have no
<PB N="93" REF="95">revolutionary motion as the &s;ix worlds or planets have that I have been de&s;cribing. Tho&s;e fixed &s;tars continue always at the &s;ame di&s;tance from each other, and always in the &s;ame place, as the Sun does in the center of our &s;y&s;tem. The probability therefore is, that each of tho&s;e fixed &s;tars is al&s;o a Sun, round which another &s;y&s;tem of worlds or planets, though too remote for us to di&s;cover, performs its revolutions, as our &s;y&s;tem of worlds does round our central Sun.</P>
<P>By this ea&s;y progre&s;&s;ion of ideas, the im|men&s;ity of &s;pace will appear to us to be filled with &s;y&s;tems of worlds; and that no part of &s;pace lies at wa&s;te, any more than any part of our globe of earth and water is left unoc|cupied.</P>
<P>Having thus endeavoured to convey, in a familiar and ea&s;y manner, &s;ome idea of the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e, I return to explain what I before alluded to, namely, the great benefits ari&s;ing to man in con&s;equence of the Creator having made a <HI>plurality</HI> of worlds, &s;uch as our &s;y&s;tem is, con&s;i&s;ting of a central &s;un and &s;ix worlds, be&s;ides &s;atellites, in pre|ference
<PB N="94" REF="96">to that of creating one world only of a va&s;t extent.</P>
<P>It is an idea I have never lo&s;t &s;ight of, that all our knowledge of &s;cience is derived from the revolutions (exhibited to our eye, and from thence to our under&s;tanding) which tho&s;e &s;everal planets, or worlds, of which our &s;y&s;tem is compo&s;ed, make in their cir|cuit round the Sun.</P>
<P>Had then the quantity of matter which the&s;e &s;ix worlds contain been blended into one &s;olitary globe, the con&s;equence to us would have been, that either no revolution|ary motion would have exi&s;ted, or not a &s;uf|ficiency of it, to give us the ideas and the knowledge of &s;cience we now have; and it is from the &s;ciences that all the mechanical arts that contribute &s;o much to our earthly felicity and comfort are derived.</P>
<P>As therefore the Creator made nothing in vain, &s;o al&s;o mu&s;t it be believed that he or|ganized the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e in the mo&s;t advantageous manner for the benefit of man; and as we &s;ee, and from experience feel,
<PB N="95" REF="97">the benefits we derive from the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e, formed as it is, which benefits we &s;hould not have had the opportunity of enjoying, if the &s;tructure, &s;o far as relates to our &s;y&s;tem, had been a &s;olitary globe, we can di&s;cover, at lea&s;t, one rea&s;on why a <HI>plu|rality</HI> of worlds has been made, and that rea&s;on calls forth the devotional gratitude of man, as well as his admiration.</P>
<P>But it is not to us, the inhabitants of this globe, only, that the benefits ari&s;ing from a plurality of worlds are limited. The inha|bitants of each of the worlds, of which our &s;y&s;tem is compo&s;ed, enjoy the &s;ame oppor|tunities of knowledge as we do. They be|hold the revolutionary motions of our earth, as we behold theirs. All the planets revolve in &s;ight of each other; and therefore the &s;ame univer&s;al &s;chool of &s;cience pre&s;ents it&s;elf to all.</P>
<P>Neither does the knowledge &s;top here. The &s;y&s;tem of worlds, next to us, exhibits in its revolutions, the &s;ame principles and &s;chool of &s;cience, to the inhabitants of their
<PB N="96" REF="98">&s;y&s;tem, as our &s;y&s;tem does to us, and in like manner throughout the immen&s;ity of &s;pace.</P>
<P>Our ideas, not only of the almightine&s;s of the Creator, but of his wi&s;dom and his be|neficence, become enlarged in proportion as we contemplate the extent and the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e. The &s;olitary idea of a &s;oli|tary world rolling, or at re&s;t, in the immen&s;e ocean of &s;pace, gives place to the cheerful idea of a &s;ociety of worlds, &s;o happily con|trived, as to admini&s;ter, even by their mo|tion, in&s;truction to man. We &s;ee our own earth filled with abundance; but we forget to con&s;ider how much of that abundance is owing to the &s;cientific knowledge the va&s;t machinery of the univer&s;e has unfolded.</P>
<P>But, in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e reflections, what are we to think of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith that forms it&s;elf upon the idea of only one world, and that of no greater extent, as is before &s;hewn, than twenty five thou&s;and miles. An extent, which a man walking at the rate of three miles an hour, for twelve hours in the day, could he keep on in a cir|cular direction, would walk entirely round
<PB N="97" REF="99">in le&s;s than two years. Alas! what is this to the mighty ocean of &s;pace, and the al|mighty power of the Creator!</P>
<P>From whence then could ari&s;e the &s;olitary and &s;trange conceit that the Almighty, who had millions of worlds equally dependent on his protection, &s;hould quit the care of all the re&s;t, and come to die in our world, be|cau&s;e, they &s;ay, one man and one woman had eaten an apple. And, on the other hand, are we to &s;uppo&s;e that every world, in the boundle&s;s creation, had an Eve, an apple, a &s;erpent, and a redeemer. In this ca&s;e, the per&s;on who is irreverently called the Son of God, and &s;ometimes God him|&s;elf, would have nothing el&s;e to do than to travel from world to world, in an endle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of death, with &s;carcely a momen|tary interval of life.</P>
<P>It has been, by rejecting the evidence, that the word, or works of God in the crea|tion, affords to our &s;en&s;es, and the action of our rea&s;on upon that evidence, that &s;o many wild and whim&s;ical &s;y&s;tems of faith, and of religion, have been fabricated and &s;et up.
<PB N="98" REF="100">There may be many &s;y&s;tems of religion, that &s;o far from being morally bad, are in many re&s;pects morally good: but there can be but ONE that is true; and that one, nece&s;|&s;arily mu&s;t, as it ever will, be in all things con&s;i&s;tent with the ever exi&s;ting word of God that we behold in his works. But &s;uch is, the &s;trange con&s;truction of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;|tem of faith, that every evidence the heavens affords to man, either directly contradicts it, or renders it ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible to believe, and I always feel plea&s;ure in encouraging my&s;elf to believe it, that there have been men in the world who per&s;uaded them&s;elves that, what is called <HI>a pious fraud,</HI> might, at lea&s;t under particular circum&s;tances, be productive of &s;ome good. But the fraud being once e&s;tabli&s;hed, could not afterwards be explained; for it is with a pious fraud, as with a bad action, it begets a calamitous nece&s;&s;ity of going on.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons who fir&s;t preached the chri&s;|tian &s;y&s;tem of faith, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure combined with it the morality preached by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, might per&s;uade them&s;elves that
<PB N="99" REF="101">it was better than the heathen mythology that then prevailed. From the fir&s;t preach|ers, the fraud went on to the &s;econd, and to the third, till the idea of its being a pious fraud became lo&s;t in the belief of its being true; and that belief came again encou|raged by the intere&s;t of tho&s;e who made a livelihood by preaching it.</P>
<P>But though &s;uch a belief might, by &s;uch means, be rendered almo&s;t general among the laity, it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to account for the continual per&s;ecution carried on by the church, for &s;everal hundred years, again&s;t the &s;ciences and again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of &s;ci|ence, if the church had not &s;ome record or &s;ome tradition, that it was originally no other than a pious fraud, or did not fore&s;ee, that it could not be maintained again&s;t the evidence that the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e afforded.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn the irreconcileable in|con&s;i&s;tencies between the real word of God exi&s;ting in the univer&s;e, and that which is called, <HI>the word of God,</HI> as &s;hewn to us in a printed book, that any man might make, I
<PB N="100" REF="102">proceed to &s;peak of the three principal means that have been employed in all ages, and perhaps in all countries, to impo&s;e upon mankind.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e three means are, My&s;tery, Miracle, and Prophecy. The two fir&s;t are incompa|tible with true religion, and the third ought always to be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to my&s;tery, every thing we behold is, in one &s;en&s;e a my&s;tery, to us. Our own exi&s;tence is a my&s;tery: the whole vege|table world is a my&s;tery. We cannot ac|count how it is that an acorn, when put into the ground, is made to develop it&s;elf, and become an oak. We know not how it is that the &s;eed we &s;ow unfolds and multiplies it&s;elf, and returns to us &s;uch an abundant intere&s;t for &s;o &s;mall a capital.</P>
<P>The fact, however, as di&s;tinct from the operating cau&s;e, is not a my&s;tery becau&s;e we &s;ee it; and we know al&s;o the means we are to u&s;e, which is no other than putting the &s;eed in the ground. We know therefore as much as is nece&s;&s;ary for us to know; and
<PB N="101" REF="103">that part of the operation that we do not know, and which if we did, we could not perform, the Creator takes upon him&s;elf and performs it for us. We are therefore better off than if we had been let into the &s;ecret, and left to do it for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>But though every created thing is in this &s;en&s;e a my&s;tery, the word my&s;tery cannot be applied to <HI>moral truth,</HI> any more than ob&s;curity can be applied to light. The God in whom we believe is a God of moral truth, and not a God of my&s;tery or ob&s;curity. My&s;tery is the antagoni&s;t of truth. It is a fog of human invention, that ob&s;cures truth and repre&s;ents it in di&s;tortion. Truth never invelops <HI>it&s;elf</HI> in my&s;tery; and the my&s;tery in which it is at any time enveloped, is the work of its antagoni&s;t, and never of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Religion, therefore, being the belief of a God, and the practice of moral truth, can|not have connection with my&s;tery. The be|lief of a God, &s;o far from having any thing of my&s;tery in it, is of all beliefs the mo&s;t ea&s;y, becau&s;e it ari&s;es to us, as is before ob|&s;erved,
<PB N="102" REF="104">out of nece&s;&s;ity. And the practice of moral truth, or in other words, a practi|cal imitation of the moral goodne&s;s of God, is no other than our acting towards each other, as he acts benignly towards all. We cannot <HI>&s;erve</HI> God in the manner we &s;erve tho&s;e who cannot do without &s;uch &s;ervice; and, therefore, the only idea we can have of &s;erving God, is that of contributing to the happine&s;s of the living creation that God has made. This cannot be done by retiring our&s;elves from the &s;ociety of the world, and &s;pending a reclu&s;e life in &s;elfi&s;h devotion.</P>
<P>The very nature and de&s;ign of religion, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, prove even to demon|&s;tration, that it mu&s;t be free from every thing of my&s;tery, and unincumbered with every thing that is my&s;terious. Religion, con&s;idered as a duty, is incumbent upon every living &s;oul alike, and therefore mu&s;t be on a level to the under&s;tanding and com|prehen&s;ion of all. Man does not learn reli|gion as he learns the &s;ecrets and my&s;teries of a trade. He learns the theory of religion by reflection. It ari&s;es out of the action of his own mind upon the things which he
<PB N="103" REF="105">&s;ees, or upon what he may happen to hear or to read, and the practice joins it&s;elf there|to.</P>
<P>When men, whether from policy or pious fraud, &s;et up &s;y&s;tems of religion incom|patible with the word or works of God in the creation, and not only above but repug|nant to human comprehen&s;ion, they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of inventing, or adopt|ing, a word that &s;hould &s;erve as a bar to all que&s;tions, inquiries, and &s;peculations. The word <HI>my&s;tery</HI> an&s;wered this purpo&s;e; and thus it has happened, that religion, which, in it&s;elf, is without my&s;tery, has been cor|rupted into a fog of my&s;teries.</P>
<P>As <HI>my&s;tery</HI> an&s;wered all general purpo&s;es, <HI>miracle</HI> followed as an occa&s;ional auxiliary. The former &s;erved to bewilder the mind, the latter to puzzle the &s;en&s;es. The one was the lingo; the other the legerdemain.</P>
<P>But before going further into this &s;ubject, it will be proper to inquire what is to be under&s;tood by a miracle.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="106">In the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that every thing may be &s;aid to be a my&s;tery, &s;o al&s;o may it be &s;aid, that every thing is a miracle, and that no one thing is a greater miracle than ano|ther. The elephant, though larger, is not a greater miracle than a mite; nor a moun|tain a greater miracle than an atom. To an almighty power, it is no more difficult to make the one than the other, and no more difficult to make a million of worlds than to make one. Every thing therefore is a mira|cle in one &s;en&s;e; whil&s;t, in the other &s;en&s;e, there is no &s;uch thing as a miracle. It is a miracle when compared to our power, and to our comprehen&s;ion. It is not a miracle compared to the power that performs it. But as nothing in this de&s;cription conveys the idea that is affixed to the word miracle, it is nece&s;&s;ary to carry the inquiry further.</P>
<P>Mankind have conceived to them&s;elves certain laws by which, what they call, na|ture, is &s;uppo&s;ed to act; and that a miracle is &s;omething contrary to the operation and effect of tho&s;e laws. But unle&s;s we know the whole extent of tho&s;e laws, and of what are commonly called, the powers of nature,
<PB N="105" REF="107">we are not able to judge whether any thing that may appear to us wonderful, or mira|culous, be within, or be beyond, or be contrary to, her natural power of acting.</P>
<P>The a&s;cen&s;ion of a man &s;everal miles high into the air, would have every thing in it that con&s;titutes the idea of a miracle, if it were not known that a &s;pecies of air can be generated &s;everal times lighter than the com|mon atmo&s;pheric air, and yet po&s;&s;e&s;s ela&s;ti|city enough to prevent the balloon, in which that light air is inclo&s;ed, from being com|pre&s;&s;ed into as many times le&s;s bulk, by the common air that &s;urrounds it. In like man|ner, extracting fla&s;hes or &s;parks of fire from the human body as vi&s;ibly as from a &s;teel &s;truck with a flint, and cau&s;ing iron or &s;teel to move without any vi&s;ible agent, would al&s;o give the idea of a miracle, if we were not acquainted with electricity and magneti&s;m: &s;o al&s;o would many other experiments in natural philo&s;ophy, to tho&s;e who are not acquainted with the &s;ubject. The re&s;toring per&s;ons to life, who are to appearance dead, as is practi&s;ed upon drowned per&s;ons, would al&s;o be a miracle, if it were not known that
<PB N="106" REF="108">animation is capable of being &s;u&s;pended without being extinct.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are performances by &s;light of hand, and by per&s;ons acting in con|cert, that have a miraculous appearance, which, when known, are thought nothing of. And be&s;ides the&s;e, there are mechanical and optical deceptions. There is now an exhi|bition in Paris of gho&s;ts or &s;pectres, which, though it is not impo&s;ed upon the &s;pectators as a fact, has an a&s;toni&s;hing appearance. As therefore we know not the extent to which either nature or art can go, there is no po&s;i|tive criterion to determine what a miracle is; and mankind, in giving credit to appear|ances, under the idea of their being miracles, are &s;ubject to be continually impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>Since then appearances are &s;o capable of deceiving, and things not real have a &s;trong re&s;emblance to things that are, nothing can be more incon&s;i&s;tent, than to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Almighty would make u&s;e of means, &s;uch as are called miracles, that would &s;ub|ject the per&s;on who performed them to the &s;u&s;picion of being an impo&s;tor, and the per|&s;on
<PB N="107" REF="109">who related them to be &s;u&s;pected of lying, and the doctrine intended to be &s;upported thereby, to be &s;u&s;pected as a fabulous in|vention.</P>
<P>Of all the modes of evidence that ever were invented to obtain belief to any &s;y&s;tem or opinion, to which the name of religion has been given, that of <HI>miracle,</HI> however &s;ucce&s;sful the impo&s;ition may have been, is the mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent. For, in the fir&s;t place, whenever recour&s;e is had to &s;how, for the purpo&s;e of procuring that belief (for a miracle, under any idea of the word, is a &s;how) it implies a lamene&s;s or weakne&s;s in the doctrine that is preached. And, in the &s;econd place, it is degrading the Almighty into the character of a &s;how-man, playing tricks to amu&s;e and make the people &s;tare and wonder. It is al&s;o the mo&s;t equivocal &s;ort of evidence that can be &s;et up; for the belief is not to depend upon the thing called a miracle, but upon the credit of the re|porter, who &s;ays that he &s;aw it; and there|fore the thing, were it true, would have no better chance of being believed than if it were a lie.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="110">Suppo&s;e, I were to &s;ay, that when I &s;at down to write this book, a hand pre&s;ented it&s;elf in the air, took up the pen, and wrote every word that is herein written; would any body believe me? certainly they would not. Would they believe me a whit the more if the thing had been a fact? certainly they would not. Since then, a real miracle, were it to happen, would be &s;ubject to the &s;ame fate as the fal&s;hood, the incon&s;i&s;tency becomes the greater, of &s;uppo&s;ing the Al|mighty would make u&s;e of means that would not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e for which they were intended, even if they were real.</P>
<P>If we are to &s;uppo&s;e a miracle to be &s;ome|thing &s;o entirely out of the cour&s;e of what is called nature, that &s;he mu&s;t go out of that cour&s;e to accompli&s;h it; and we &s;ee an ac|count given of &s;uch miracle by the per&s;on who &s;aid he &s;aw it, it rai&s;es a que&s;tion in the mind very ea&s;ily decided, which is, Is it more probable that nature &s;hould go out of her cour&s;e, or that a man &s;hould tell a lie? We have never &s;een, in our time, nature go out of her cour&s;e, but we have good rea&s;on to believe that millions of lies have been told
<PB N="109" REF="111">in the &s;ame time; it is therefore at lea&s;t millions to one, that the reporter of a mira|cle tells a lie.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of the whale &s;wallowing Jonah, though a whale is large enough to do it, borders greatly on the marvellous; but it would have approached nearer to the idea of a miracle, if Jonah had &s;wallowed the whale. In this, which may &s;erve for all ca&s;es of miracles, the matter would decide it&s;elf as before &s;tated, namely, Is it more probable that a man &s;hould have &s;wallowed a whale, or told a lie?</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing that Jonah had really &s;wal|lowed the whale, and gone with it in his belly to Nineveh, and to convince the peo|ple that it was true, have ca&s;t it up in their &s;ight of the full length and &s;ize of a whale, would they not have believed him to have been the devil in&s;tead of a prophet? or, if the whale had carried Jonah to Nineveh, and ca&s;t him up in the &s;ame public manner, would they not have believed the whale to have been the devil, and Jonah one of his imps?</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112">The mo&s;t extraordinary of all the things called miracles, related in the New Te&s;ta|ment, is that of the devil flying away with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and carrying him to the top of a high mountain; and to the top of the highe&s;t pinnacle of the temple, and &s;howing him, and promi&s;ing to him <HI>all the kingdoms of the world.</HI> How happened it that he did not di&s;cover America? or is it only with <HI>kingdoms</HI> that his &s;ooty highne&s;s has any intere&s;t?</P>
<P>I have too much re&s;pect for the moral character of Chri&s;t, to believe that he told this whale of a miracle him&s;elf; neither is it ea&s;y to account for what purpo&s;e it could have been fabricated, unle&s;s it were to im|po&s;e upon the connoi&s;&s;eurs of miracles, as is &s;ometimes practi&s;ed upon the connoi&s;&s;eurs of Queen Anne's farthings, and collectors of re|lics and antiquities; or to render the belief of miracles ridiculous, by outdoing miracle, as Don Quixote outdid chivalry; or to embar|ra&s;s the belief of miracles by making it doubtful by what power, whether of God, or of the devil, any thing called a miracle was performed. It requires, however, a great
<PB N="111" REF="113">deal of faith in the devil to believe this miracle.</P>
<P>In every point of view, in which tho&s;e things called miracles can be placed and con&s;idered, the reality of them is improbable, and their exi&s;tence unnece&s;&s;ary. They would not, as before ob&s;erved, an&s;wer any u&s;eful purpo&s;e, even if they were true; for it is more difficult to obtain belief to a mi|racle, than to a principle evidently moral, without any miracle. Moral principle &s;peaks univer&s;ally for it&s;elf. Miracle could be but a thing of the moment, and &s;een but by a few; after this, it requires a transfer of faith, from God to man, to believe a mira|cle upon man's report. In&s;tead therefore of admitting the recitals of miracles, as evidence of any &s;y&s;tem of religion being true, they ought to be con&s;idered as &s;ymptoms of its being fabulous. It is nece&s;&s;ary to the full and upright character of truth, that it rejects the crutch; and it is con&s;i&s;tent with the character of fable, to &s;eek the aid that truth rejects. Thus much for my&s;tery and mi|racle.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="114">As my&s;tery and miracle took charge of the pa&s;t and the pre&s;ent, prophecy took charge of the future, and rounded the ten&s;es of faith. It was not &s;ufficient to know what had been done, but what would be done. The &s;uppo&s;ed prophet was the &s;uppo&s;ed hi&s;torian of times to come; and if he happened, in &s;hooting with a long bow of a thou&s;and years, to &s;trike within a thou&s;and miles of a mark, the ingenuity of po&s;terity could make it point-blank; and if he hap|pened to be directly wrong, it was only to &s;uppo&s;e, as in the ca&s;e of Jonah and Nine|veh, that God had repented him&s;elf, and changed his mind. What a fool do fabulous &s;y&s;tems make of man!</P>
<P>It has been &s;hewn in a former part of this work, that the original meaning of the words <HI>prophet</HI> and <HI>prophe&s;ying</HI> has been changed, and that a prophet, in the &s;en&s;e the word is now u&s;ed, is a creature of modern invention; and it is owing to this change in the mean|ing of the words, that the flights and meta|phors of the Jewi&s;h poets, and phra&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions now rendered ob&s;cure by our not being acquainted with the local circum|&s;tances
<PB N="113" REF="115">to which they applied at the time they were u&s;ed, have been erected into pro|phecies, and made to bend to explanations at the will and whim&s;ical conceits of &s;ecta|ries, expounders, and commentators. Every thing unintelligible was prophetical, and every thing in&s;ignificant was typical. A blunder would have &s;erved for a prophecy; and a di&s;h-clout for a type.</P>
<P>If by a prophet we are to &s;uppo&s;e a man, to whom the Almighty communicated &s;ome event that would take place in future, either there were &s;uch men, or there were not. If there were, it is con&s;i&s;tent to believe that the event, &s;o communicated, would be told in terms that could be under&s;tood; and not related in &s;uch a loo&s;e and ob&s;cure manner as to be out of the comprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e that heard it, and &s;o equivocal as to fit al|mo&s;t any circum&s;tance that might happen afterwards. It is conceiving very irreve|rently of the Almighty to &s;uppo&s;e he would deal in this je&s;ting manner with mankind: yet all the things called prophecies, in the book called the Bible, come under this de&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="116">But it is with prophecy, as it is with miracle. It could not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e even if it were real. Tho&s;e to whom a prophecy &s;hould be told, could not tell whether the man prophe&s;ied or lied, or whe|ther it had been revealed to him, or whether he conceited it: and if the thing that he prophe&s;ied, or pretended to prophe&s;y, &s;hould happen, or &s;omething like it among the multitude of things that are daily happening, nobody could again know whether he fore|knew it, or gue&s;&s;ed at it, or whether it was accidental. A prophet, therefore, is a cha|racter u&s;ele&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary; and the &s;afe &s;ide of the ca&s;e is, to guard again&s;t being impo&s;ed upon by not giving credit to &s;uch relations.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, my&s;tery, miracle, and prophecy, are appendages that belong to fabulous and not to true religion. They are the means by which &s;o many <HI>Lo heres!</HI> and <HI>Lo theres!</HI> have been &s;pread about the world, and religion been made into a trade. The &s;ucce&s;s of one impo&s;tor gave encou|ragement to another, and the quieting &s;alvo
<PB N="115" REF="117">of doing <HI>&s;ome good</HI> by keeping up a <HI>pious fraud,</HI> protected them from remor&s;e.</P>
<P>Having now extended the &s;ubject to a greater length than I fir&s;t intended, I &s;hall bring it to a clo&s;e by ab&s;tracting a &s;ummary from the whole.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the idea or belief of a word of God exi&s;ting in print, or in writing, or in &s;peech, is incon&s;i&s;tent in it&s;elf for the rea&s;ons already a&s;&s;igned. The&s;e rea&s;ons, among many others, are the want of an univer&s;al language; the mutability of language; the errors to which tran&s;lations are &s;ubject; the po&s;&s;ibility of totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;uch a word; the probability of altering it, or of fabrica|ting the whole, and impo&s;ing it upon the world.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the creation we behold is the real and ever exi&s;ting word of God, in which we cannot be deceived. It pro|claimeth his power, it demon&s;trates his wi&s;|dom, it manife&s;ts his goodne&s;s and bene|ficence.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118">Thirdly, That the moral duty of man con&s;i&s;ts in imitating the moral goodne&s;s and beneficence of God manife&s;ted in the crea|tion towards all his creatures. That &s;eeing, as we daily do, the goodne&s;s of God to all men, it is an example calling upon all men to practi&s;e the &s;ame towards each other, and con&s;equently that every thing of per&s;e|cution and revenge between man and man, and every thing of cruelty to animals is a violation of moral duty.</P>
<P>I trouble not my&s;elf about the manner of future exi&s;tence. I content my&s;elf with believing, even to po&s;itive conviction, that the power that gave me exi&s;tence is able to continue it, in any form and manner he plea&s;es, either with or without this body; and it appears more probable to me that I &s;hall continue to exi&s;t hereafter, than that I &s;hould have had exi&s;tence, as I now have, before that exi&s;tence began.</P>
<P>It is certain that, in one point, all nations of the earth, and all religions agree. All believe in a God. The things in which they di&s;agree, are the redundancies annexed
<PB N="117" REF="119">to that belief; and therefore, if ever an uni|ver&s;al religion &s;hould prevail, it will not be believing any thing new, but in getting rid of redundancies, and believing as man be|lieved at fir&s;t. Adam, if ever there was &s;uch a man, was created a Dei&s;t; but in the mean time let every man follow, as he has a right to do, the religion and the wor&s;hip he prefers.</P>
