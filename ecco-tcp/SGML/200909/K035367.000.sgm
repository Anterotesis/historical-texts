<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following <Q>Declaration of the People's natural Right to a Share in the Legi&s;lature</Q> is founded on Principles, which are cer|tainly unque&s;tionable, and cannot ea&s;ily be controverted; but I was not aware, I acknowledge,<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><P>I freely acknowledge my deficiency in <HI>hi&s;torical</HI> as well as mo&s;t other branches of Learning, which re|quire much reading and lei&s;ure to be obtained; but though this affords an argument again&s;t <HI>my own per&s;o|nal credit and abilities, in general,</HI> as a writer, yet it does not at all affect any particular point, which, in my &s;e|veral tracts, I have laboured to maintain; for, upon the&s;e, a candid Reader will determine according to the evidence produced, and not by the general character or <HI>demerit</HI> of the Author in other re&s;pects.</P></NOTE> when I &s;ent the &s;ame to the Pre&s;s, that there had ever been any Controver&s;y before the 6th of King George I. concerning the Freedom of our fellow-&s;ubjects in <HI>Ireland,</HI> or that any Engli&s;hman, acquainted with the principles of our excellent Con&s;titution of State, had ever, before that time, pre&s;umed to advance any doctrine which might tend to deprive our Iri&s;h Brethren
<PB N="ii" REF="4">of their <HI>natural Freedom,</HI> and of the in|e&s;timable benefits of that happy legal Con&s;titution, which Briti&s;h Subjects in general are commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to inhe|rit by <HI>Birth-right!</HI></P>
<P>If I had not e&s;teemed this point <HI>incon|trovertible,</HI> when I wrote the &s;aid <HI>Decla|ration,</HI> I &s;hould not have quoted the Union between <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ire|land</HI> as an example of <Q><HI>the true con&s;titu|tional</HI> mode of <HI>connecting Briti&s;h Do|minions</HI> that are otherwi&s;e <HI>&s;eparated by nature.</HI></Q> But having done this, and having al&s;o given &s;everal copies of the Declaration to my friends which cannot now be recalled, I have thereby brought upon my&s;elf the nece&s;&s;ity of maintaining the propriety of the &s;aid example, which might as ea&s;ily have been avoided, had I been aware of any &s;uch controver&s;y; be|cau&s;e the general principles, on which my arguments are founded, would have been amply &s;ufficient (I apprehend) to prove the truth of my <HI>Declaration,</HI> even though <HI>Examples</HI> and <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> had been again&s;t it; for the Common Law of <HI>England</HI> teaches us, that examples and precedents are not to be followed if they are <HI>unrea&s;onable,</HI> or incon&s;i&s;tent with
<PB N="iii" REF="5"><HI>legal</HI> and <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> Principles<NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot"><P>This is clearly proved by a variety of unque&s;|tionable maxims;
<Q><L>Judicandum e&s;t <HI>Legibus, non Exemplis.</HI></L>
<L>Malus u&s;us abolendus e&s;t.</L></Q>
<Q>In con&s;uetudinibus non diuturnitas temporis, &s;od <HI>&s;oliditas rationis,</HI> con&s;ideranda e&s;t.</Q>
<Q>Multitudo <HI>errantium</HI> non parit <HI>errori</HI> patroci|nium.</Q></P></NOTE>; though, on the other hand, they are to be e&s;teemed of very great weight and authority in Law, when there are <HI>no ju&s;t exceptions</HI> again&s;t them<NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot"><Q>&mdash; et quia con&s;uetudines illae <HI>nec contra legem divinam nec contra rationem</HI> in aliquo exi&s;tunt, et pro bono communi totius Regni ex earum diurni|tate cen&s;entur, fore nece&s;&s;ariae, <HI>vim Legis retinent,</HI> &amp;c. <BIBL>Doct. et Stud. c. 7.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. And of this latter kind is the Example which I have quoted to illu&s;trate my Declara|tion: for, though many great and re&s;pec|table Writers have made <HI>exceptions</HI> to the con&s;titutional Freedom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which I had &s;uppo&s;ed to be unque&s;tionable, yet, after the mo&s;t careful examination of their opinions, and the <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> given for the &s;ame, (in which the proofs ought to con&s;i&s;t,) I am now fully convinced that there are <HI>no ju&s;t exceptions</HI> again&s;t that example; and, con&s;equently, I am bound in ju&s;tice, to my fellow-&s;ubjects in <HI>Ireland</HI> not to give it up; becau&s;e the
<PB N="iv" REF="6"><HI>"nece&s;&s;ity"</HI> (beforementioned) <Q>of main|taining the <HI>propriety of the example,</HI></Q> ci|ted in my Declaration, ari&s;es not from any ob&s;tinate partiality to my own a&s;|&s;ertion, (which I confe&s;s was, at fir&s;t, too ha&s;tily and unadvi&s;edly made,) but from a firm per&s;ua&s;ion, after a mo&s;t cautious enquiry into the real &s;tate of the controver&s;y, that the advocates for the Liberties of <HI>Ireland</HI> have Truth and Rea|&s;on on their &s;ide, which, (I hope) the 2d Part, now added to my Declaration, will &s;ufficiently te&s;tify.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o for me to guard again&s;t another objection which might perhaps hereafter have been &s;tarted a|gain&s;t the following <HI>Declaration.</HI></P>
<P>I have quoted therein a maxim of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, as a principle of <HI>natural equity,</HI> which had previou&s;ly been denied that rank by one of the mo&s;t eminent civilians of his time; and there|fore, to avoid the influence of &s;o great an authority again&s;t my Argument, I think it prudent, in this Preface, to examine the grounds of his objections, that my Readers may have &s;ufficient evidence be|fore them to di&s;tingui&s;h where the truth lies; for it is certainly nece&s;&s;ary for me
<PB N="v" REF="7">to e&s;tabli&s;h the fir&s;t <HI>principles</HI> on which I have proceeded, before I can expect to have any attention paid to the Arguments which I have built upon them.</P>
<P>The maxim which I wi&s;h to maintain is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> that <Q>Law, to bind all, mu&s;t be a&s;&s;ented to by all<NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot"><P>Principia Leg. et Aequit. p. 56. to which is added, by way of illu&s;tration, <Q>Canons therefore bind not the Laity.</Q></P></NOTE>.</Q> This maxim I have quoted in the following Declaration as a principle of <HI>natural Equity;</HI> though, it &s;eems, the learned Civilian, Baron Puffendorf, has expre&s;&s;ly refu&s;ed to rank it with the <HI>Laws of Na|ture:</HI> He, or (rather I &s;hould &s;ay) his Tran&s;lator, calls<NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot"><P>The Edition which I have followed is only an Engli&s;h tran&s;lation printed at Oxford in 1710.</P></NOTE> it only <HI>a notion.</HI></P>
<P>"We cannot here but ob&s;erve," (&s;ays he,) <Q>that the <HI>Notion,</HI> maintained by &s;ome authors, <HI>That the Con&s;ent of the People is requi&s;ite to make Laws oblige the Subject in Con&s;cience,</HI> is neither true <HI>in the Laws of Nature,</HI> nor in the civil Laws of monarchical or of ari&s;to|cratical Rulers; nor indeed at all, un|le&s;s it be under&s;tood of implicit con|&s;ent; as a man, by agreeing to the
<PB N="vi" REF="8">Sovereignty of another, is at the &s;ame time, &s;uppo&s;ed to have agreed to all the future Acts of that Sovereignty<NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">Law of Nature and Nations, Book 1. c. 6. p. 55.</NOTE>.</Q> (He has neverthele&s;s thought proper to add an ob&s;ervation which makes &s;trongly again&s;t his own argument.) "Though it would really be very u&s;eful," (&s;ays he,) <Q>and contribute much to engaging the Subjects in a <HI>voluntary Obedience,</HI> if the Laws could be made <HI>with their Con&s;ent</HI> and Approbation; e&s;pecially &s;uch as are to pa&s;s into their Lives and Manners.</Q></P>
<P>Now it would be impo&s;&s;ible (I appre|hend) to find &s;o ju&s;t a rea&s;on in favour of the former part of the learned Baron's a&s;&s;ertion, as he him&s;elf has here given <HI>directly again&s;t it;</HI> and yet he is frequent|ly harping upon the &s;ame har&s;h &s;tring of ab&s;olute implicit obedience; which in|con&s;i&s;tency cannot ea&s;ily be accounted for, unle&s;s it be attributed to <HI>the prejudice of his education</HI> as a &s;tudent in <HI>the Impe|perial or Civil Law.</HI> For though the Civil Law contains many excellent max|ims highly worthy of our e&s;teem, mo&s;t of which have been adopted by our an|cient
<PB N="vii" REF="9">Engli&s;h writers of the Common Law of this Kingdom<NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot"><Q>What u&s;e our ance&s;tors have made of the civil Law will readily appear to any one, that will take the trouble to compare the &s;everal works, which com|po&s;e that voluminous body, with &s;ome of the mo&s;t ancient Engli&s;h Lawyers, as Glanvil, Bracton, and others; who have adhered very clo&s;ely to the rules and method of Ju&s;tinian; have tran&s;cribed his Laws in their own proper language, and &s;ome|times entire titles, as familiarly as if they were the original Laws of England. <BIBL>Dr. Bever's Di&s;cour&s;e on the Study of Juris-prudence and the Civil Law, p. 17.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>; yet it includes &s;ome heterogeneous po&s;itions (that have been forced upon it by the overbearing influence and corrupt practices of unli|mited Imperial Courts) which are highly unrea&s;onable and contradictory to the ge|neral equity of its other principles. A po&s;ition of this kind, too implicitly re|ceived as Law, &s;eems to be the ground-work of the learned Baron's difficulty: I mean that <HI>unrea&s;onable</HI> and dangerous po&s;ition of the Civil Law, which attri|butes to the Prince's <HI>Will and Plea&s;ure</HI> the <HI>Force</HI> of Law<NOTE N="(8)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Quod Principi placuit (juxta Leges Civiles) Legis habet vigorem. <BIBL>Forte&s;cue de Laud. Leg. Ang. c. 35. p. 83.</BIBL></Q>
<P>In this &s;ame chapter the learned Chancellor Forte&s;|cue recites many dreadful effects of this abominable
<PB N="viii" REF="10">principle in the Government and Police of <HI>France.</HI> viz. the pernicious and dangerous Policy of maintain|ing a <HI>&s;tanding army;</HI> for which the people were com|pelled to provide quarters and provi&s;ions, in all the great towns and villages.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the abominable oppre&s;&s;ion of the Salt Tax, whereby the poor were compelled to purcha&s;e of the King a certain quantity of <HI>Salt</HI> (whether they cho&s;e to have it or not) at an exce&s;&s;ive price; by which, to|gether with the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments <HI>to pay the troops,</HI> and va|rious other tallage rateable at the <HI>King's plea&s;ure,</HI> the common people were reduced to extreme penury, and want of every comfort in life. And, with re&s;pect to per&s;ons of highter rank, if any Nobleman or Gentle|man was accu&s;ed of a crime, even by his enemies, he was liable to be dragged to a <HI>private examination,</HI> by the intermediation of me&s;&s;engers in the King's cham|ber, or el&s;ewhere, in a private place, without &s;eeing his accu&s;ers (him&s;elf alone being &s;een); and when the King (or perhaps his Mini&s;ter) has <HI>been plea&s;ed</HI> to judge him guilty, the poor <HI>pa&s;&s;ive Subject</HI> is popped into a &s;ack, and in the night time ca&s;t into the river by the Mar&s;hal's &s;ervants. How&s;oever incredible &s;uch abominable inju&s;tice may appear to Engli&s;hmen, yet the worthy Chancellor, who wrote this account for the in&s;truction of Edward Prince of Wales (the &s;on of King Henry VI.) when in France, appeals to the young Prince's <HI>own knowledge</HI> of the notoriety of &s;uch facts: "You have heard," (&s;ays he) <Q>that more men (by much) have died in this manner than by the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice; yet neverthele&s;s</Q> (&s;ays he ironically) <Q><HI>what&s;oever hath plea&s;ed the King (according to the Civil Law) has the force of Law.</HI> And while you have been in France, and in the neighbourhood of that Kingdom,</Q> (continues the
<PB N="ix" REF="11">Chancellor to the young Prince,) <Q>you have heard of other <HI>enormities</HI> like to the&s;e, and &s;ome even wor&s;e than the&s;e &mdash;<HI>dete&s;tably</HI> and <HI>damnably perpetrated,</HI> no otherwi&s;e than under the colour (or pretence) of <HI>that Law, viz.</HI> Quod Principi placuit (juxta Leges Civiles) legis habet vigorem.</Q> <Q>Etiam et alia <HI>enor|mia,</HI></Q> (&s;ays he) <Q>hiis &s;imilia, acquaedam <HI>hiis deteriora,</HI> dum in Francia et prope regnum illud conver&s;atus es, audi&s;ti non alio, quam <HI>legis illius colore</HI> DETESTABILI|TUR DAMNABILITER QUE PERPETRATA, quae hic in&s;erere, no&s;trum nimium dialogum protelaret, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Whether or not <HI>this particular mode</HI> of di&s;patching the French King's Subjects is yet in u&s;e, I know not; but of this we are well a&s;&s;ured, that <HI>private executions of per&s;ons un|known</HI> are &s;till practi&s;ed there, which in effect are <HI>equal|ly dangerous,</HI> and cannot be con&s;idered in any other light than that of &s;o many <HI>wilful Murders,</HI> for which the Kings of France, and all tho&s;e men whom they have intru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, are mo&s;t certainly accountable, and mu&s;t one day an&s;wer in their own private per&s;ons <HI>as individuals,</HI> be&s;ides the enormous guilt which lies heavy upon that whole people as a <HI>nation,</HI> for <HI>pa&s;&s;ively</HI> permitting &s;uch noto|rious and crying <HI>iniquity</HI> to be practi&s;ed among them under the borrowed <HI>name</HI> of <HI>Law:</HI> And it is not only <HI>the di&s;patching of men</HI> (to put them out of the way of oppo&s;ition to Government) that is intended by the&s;e <HI>midnight executions,</HI> but al&s;o, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to &s;atisfy a ba&s;e malicious revenge by torturing the helple&s;s vic|tim with the cruel death of <HI>breaking on the wheel;</HI> for, as both the <HI>name</HI> and <HI>crime</HI> of the <HI>&s;ufferer is con|cealed,</HI> (or perhaps a wrong name given out to pre|vent pity,) it cannot be &s;aid that &s;uch cruelty is u&s;ed by way <HI>of example</HI> to deter bad men from commit|ing trea&s;on, or other particular crimes; &s;o that
<PB N="x" REF="12">&s;uch <HI>private executions</HI> can be attributed to nothing but a DIABOLICAL DEPRAVITY in the minds of tho&s;e who order them.</P>
<P>It al&s;o appears that one u&s;e of a <HI>&s;tanding Army,</HI> in that unhappy Kingdom, is to guard the avenues of &s;treets to prevent the people from di&s;covering the <HI>actors</HI> as well as <HI>&s;ufferers</HI> at &s;uch horrid <HI>ma&s;ked tragedies</HI> as I have mentioned; and therefore I cannot help remarking the extreme ab&s;urdity of that (otherwi&s;e) &s;en&s;ible and &s;hrewd people in boa&s;ting of their <HI>national military Ho|nour,</HI> when even large bodies of their be&s;t-di&s;ciplined troops, who are <HI>Frenchmen</HI> al&s;o by birth, and have the means in their own hands to render ju&s;tice and re&s;tore liberty to their <HI>much-injured countrymen,</HI> can yet tamely yield them&s;elves &s;o far to the <HI>ab&s;olute Will</HI> of any man or men on earth, as to become <HI>&s;ilent accomplices</HI> (like the dete&s;table Turki&s;h <HI>Mutes</HI> of old) to the horrid crime of <HI>wilful Murder,</HI> (for &s;uch are the <HI>&s;ecret execu|tions</HI> of France,) and profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Tools</HI> for perpetrating the mo&s;t abandoned wickedne&s;s! To &s;uch a di&s;grace|ful and <HI>&s;lavi&s;h</HI> pitch of <HI>pa&s;&s;ive obedience</HI> is that once-&s;pirited nation now reduced, that they &s;eem to give up all preten&s;ions to that <HI>fundamental Right of human Na|ture,</HI> which alone di&s;tingui&s;hes <HI>men</HI> from <HI>brutes!</HI> I mean the indi&s;pen&s;ible <HI>Right of judging for them&s;elves,</HI> and of yielding obedience to the impul&s;e of <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> accord|ing to that natural knowledge of <HI>good and evil</HI> which is implanted in <HI>all men, (French &s;oldiers</HI> as well as others;) and of which they mu&s;t one day render a &s;trict account in a &s;eparate <HI>di&s;banded</HI> &s;tate, as <HI>individuals,</HI> (which I have before remarked,) <HI>&s;tript of their arms and regimentals!</HI></P>
<P>Shall we, then, adopt the <HI>Laws of France?</HI> <Q><HI>quod principi placuit?</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is not impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a mea&s;ure may &s;ometime or other be propo&s;ed by an incon&s;iderate Mini&s;ter, and that a Parliament (through
<PB N="xi" REF="13">the <HI>unequal Repre&s;entation of the</HI> People, the <HI>want of frequent elections,</HI> and other defects in the con&s;titution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) may hereafter be led to yield their con&s;ent to it; but, even if ever that &s;hould be the ca&s;e, I &s;hall &s;till entertain hopes, from the general di&s;po&s;ition of our <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Troops, (notwith&s;tanding the alarming effects of <HI>&s;tanding Armies</HI> in all other Nations,) that they will ne|ver become &s;o dete&s;tably ba&s;e and degenerate as to per|mit their country to groan under any &s;uch iniquitous Oppre&s;&s;ions as are practi&s;ed in <HI>France!</HI> Neverthele&s;s, &s;hould <HI>they al&s;o</HI> become &s;uch <HI>&s;lavi&s;h Tools of De&s;poti&s;m,</HI> as to a&s;&s;i&s;t in enforcing any &s;uch uncon&s;titutional mea|&s;ures, let them know, for a certainty, that, as &s;oon as the <HI>national &s;pirit of Freedom</HI> (of which they at pre&s;ent participate) is, by their means, unhappily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, even they them&s;elves mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily degenerate with their countrymen, and will be no more able to &s;tand before their enemies, than the other wretched troops whom they have &s;o often driven before them!</P>
<PB N="vii" REF="9"></NOTE>. I do not find, in|deed,
<PB N="viii" REF="10">that he has literally cited the cor|rupt maxims, but he has manife&s;tly laid
<PB N="ix" REF="11">down the &s;ame principle (though in dif|ferent words) towards the beginning of
<PB N="x" REF="12">the &s;ame chapter, where he is defining the difference between <HI>Law</HI> and &s;ome
<PB N="xi" REF="13">other things, which &s;eem to bear relation to it; as <HI>Coun&s;el,</HI> which requires <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> to produce an <HI>obligation,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>"But <HI>Law,</HI>" (&s;ays he,) <Q>though it ought not to want its <HI>rea&s;ons,</HI> yet the&s;e <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> are not the cau&s;e why obe|dience is paid to it, <HI>but the power of the Exactor;</HI> who, when he has &s;ig|nified his <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> lays an <HI>obligation</HI> on the <HI>Subjects</HI> to act in conformity to his decree, though perhaps they do not &s;o well apprehend the <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> of the injunction,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and, after citing a &s;imilar pa&s;&s;age from Mr. Hobbs, he adds,
<PB N="xii" REF="14"><Q>For no man can &s;ay, <HI>&s;ic volo, &s;ic ju|beo;</HI> &s;o I will, and &s;o I command; unle&s;s,</Q></P>
<Q>&mdash; Stet pro <HI>Ratione voluntas.</HI></Q>
<Q>His <HI>Will</HI> is his <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI></Q>
<P>"We obey Laws, therefore," (&s;ays he,) <Q>not principally upon account of the matter of them, but upon account of <HI>the Legi&s;lator's Will</HI> <NOTE N="(9)" PLACE="foot">Book 1. chap. 6. &sect;. 1.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the learned Civilian &s;eems to con&s;ider <HI>the Will and Plea&s;ure</HI> of a Sove|reign as the life and &s;pirit of Laws; which <HI>notion</HI> is highly <HI>unrea&s;onable</HI> in every ca&s;e but one, <HI>viz.</HI> when we are &s;peaking of the Laws of that Sovereign alone, who&s;e <HI>Will</HI> is the fountain of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and who&s;e <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> (by our own natural <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> we are convinced) is infinite <HI>goodne&s;s, ju&s;tice,</HI> and <HI>mercy,</HI> to|wards all tho&s;e to whom he has &s;ignified his commands; becau&s;e we cannot &s;eparate the <HI>idea</HI> of infallible <HI>Rea&s;on, Wi&s;dom,</HI> and eternal <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> from any command of divine authority.</P>
<P>And yet this application of the Baron's doctrine, even to the <HI>&s;upreme</HI> Law, is not conformable throughout to what I
<PB N="xiii" REF="15">under&s;tand in this place of the Baron's idea of <HI>Law;</HI> for he a&s;&s;igns no other <Q>cau&s;e why obedience is paid to it, but the <HI>power</HI> of <HI>the Exactor;</HI></Q> whereas God's Laws have many other apparent <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of <HI>obligation,</HI> of which I have alteady mentioned the due &s;en&s;e we <HI>na|turally</HI> entertain of the infinite <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> (as well as <HI>the Power</HI>) of the Divine Author, who is &s;o far from being <HI>an Exactor</HI> of <HI>Laws,</HI> that the revelation of his will for the good government of mankind has generally been addre&s;&s;ed to the <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of Men, that their <HI>Covenant</HI> with God might be founded on <HI>free Con&s;ent,</HI> the highe&s;t and mo&s;t obli|gatory <HI>Cau&s;e of Obedience.</HI></P>
<P>Now, as the Laws of God are thus tendered to us under the equitable form of a <HI>reciprocal Covenant,</HI> thereby bind|ing even him&s;elf (the &s;upreme Lord and Creator of all things) to us, his poor mortal &s;ubjects, under <HI>conditional Promi&s;es</HI> which cannot fail on his part! how much more ought all mere <HI>worldly</HI> Governors to be re&s;trained and limi|ted by equitable <HI>Covenants</HI> of <HI>mutual obligation</HI> between them and their Sub|jects, &s;ince their <HI>equality</HI> in nature gives

<P>The con&s;ideration of this point leads me to one of the principal Grounds of Baron Puffendorf's Mi&s;take, beforemen|tioned.</P>
<P>He does not &s;eem to have been aware, that, in all &s;ocieties of men governed by <HI>Laws,</HI> &s;ome &s;ort of <HI>general Covenant</HI> mu&s;t be under&s;tood to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the &s;everal <HI>Sovereigns</HI> and their <HI>Subjects</HI> re|&s;pectively: and, though &s;uch <HI>Covenants</HI> are not always <HI>expre&s;&s;ed,</HI> yet, mo&s;t cer|tainly, they are always <HI>implied;</HI> becau&s;e we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;ume, that <HI>the Good of the People</HI> is the original intention and principal end of all <HI>legal</HI> human Go|vernments, &s;ince <HI>all Men are naturally equals,</HI> and <HI>a Man</HI> who &s;ubmits him&s;elf to the Sovereignty or Government of another, that he may enjoy the benefit and protection of &s;ociety, does not, on that account, cea&s;e to be <HI>a Man;</HI> nei|ther can the temporal Sovereign him&s;elf be relea&s;ed from the <HI>natural</HI> Tyes of <HI>that Relation:</HI> for, whenever he forgets that he him&s;elf is <HI>a Man,</HI> (of the &s;ame falli|ble under&s;tanding and natural infirmities
<PB N="xv" REF="17">with his Subjects, who are his <HI>equals</HI> both on their <HI>entrance</HI> and at their <HI>exeunt</HI> from the Stage of Life,) he immediately lo&s;es the be&s;t Rule for his Conduct as <HI>a Prince,</HI> and nece&s;&s;arily degenerates into <HI>brutality;</HI> &s;o that, in &s;uch ca&s;es, to &s;up|po&s;e that THE WILL <HI>of the Prince</HI> is to be allowed <HI>the force of Law</HI> is the high|e&s;t ab&s;urdity! Nay, even the Baron him&s;elf has el&s;ewhere declared, that <Q>the word MAN, is thought to carry &s;omewhat of <HI>Dignity</HI> in its &s;ound; and we commonly</Q> (&s;ays he) <Q>make u&s;e of this as the la&s;t and the mo&s;t prevail|ing argument again&s;t a rude in&s;ulter, <HI>I am not a Bea&s;t, a Dog, but I am</HI> A MAN <HI>as well as your&s;elf.</HI> Since then <HI>human</HI> nature agrees <HI>equally</HI> to all per|&s;ons, and &s;ince no one can live a &s;ocia|ble life with another, who does not own and re&s;pect him as <HI>a Man;</HI> it fol|lows, as a command of the Law of Nature, <HI>that</HI> EVERY MAN <HI>e&s;teem and treat</HI> ANOTHER as one who is natural|ly HIS EQUAL, or who is A MAN as well as he.</Q> (Book 3. c. 2. p. 178.) It would therefore be unrea&s;onable to conceive, that any &s;ociety of MEN &s;hould voluntarily &s;ubmit them&s;elves to a tempo|ral

<P>Neverthele&s;s, the learned Baron &s;eems to have neglected the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary con&s;ide|rations; for he a&s;&s;erts, that the di&s;|tinction between a <HI>Compact</HI> or <HI>Covenant,</HI> and a <HI>Law,</HI> is obvious. <Q>For a <HI>Com|pact</HI></Q> (&s;ays he) <Q>is a <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> but a <HI>Law</HI> is a <HI>Command.</HI> In Compacts the form of &s;peaking is <HI>I will</HI> do &s;o and &s;o; but in Law the form runs, <HI>do thou &s;o,</HI> after an imperative manner.</Q> Book 1. c. 6. &sect;. 2. p. 47.</P>
<P>He had before been &s;peaking of demo|cratical Governments, and had remarked, not only that the ancients <Q>frequently apply to Laws the name of <HI>common Agreements,</HI></Q> but al&s;o, that "the Laws"
<PB N="xvii" REF="19">(among the Grecians) <Q>were made upon the propo&s;al of the Magi&s;trate, with the Knowledge, and <HI>by the Command of the People,</HI> and &s;o</Q> (as it were) "in the way of <HI>bargain or &s;tipulation,</HI>" (&s;ays he,) <Q>they gave them the name of <HI>Covenants</HI> and <HI>Agreements</HI> beforemen|tioned:</Q> and yet he will not allow (notwith&s;tanding &s;uch authority) that they are properly &s;tiled <HI>"Covenants,"</HI> having puzzled him&s;elf with the diffe|rence between a national <HI>Covenant</HI> and a <HI>Covenant</HI> of individuals; <Q>for, in this la&s;t ca&s;e,</Q> (&s;ays he,) <Q>a per&s;on that <HI>di&s;&s;ents is not bound,</HI> and the party cannot pro|ceed without him; whereas, in the for|mer <HI>ca&s;e,</HI> even the <HI>di&s;&s;enting Party</HI> is tied and obliged by the plurality of votes.</Q> Now the learned Baron has not been aware that this very rea&s;on, which he him&s;elf has a&s;&s;igned, confirms the propriety of that ancient cu&s;tom which he condemns, (<HI>viz.</HI> the applying the name of <HI>Covenants</HI> and <HI>Agreements</HI> to <HI>Laws,</HI>) for, he allows, that <Q>the <HI>di&s;&s;ent|ing Party</HI> is tied and obliged by <HI>the plu|rality of votes,</HI></Q> and therefore, even a whole nation, in that ca&s;e, may be &s;aid to act as <HI>an individual;</HI> becau&s;e, <Q><HI>that to
<PB N="xviii" REF="20">which the greater number give con&s;ent</HI></Q> (as he him&s;elf remarks in the preceding paragraph) <Q><HI>is taken</HI> for the <HI>Will and De|cree of all;</HI></Q> &s;o that, by this means, a <HI>whole Nation</HI> is as capable of making a <HI>Covenant</HI> or <HI>Compact</HI> as an <HI>Individual;</HI> and I will only add, to what the Baron has allowed about the <HI>binding</HI> of <HI>tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ent,</HI> that they are bound <HI>only &s;o far</HI> as the impo&s;ed <HI>Obligation</HI> is con&s;i&s;tent with their <HI>&s;uperior Covenant</HI> and duty to God, which is always to be <HI>implied:</HI> for even the SOVEREIGN of <HI>the World,</HI> THE KING OF KINGS, who alone can be &s;aid to have an <HI>ab&s;olute Right</HI> to govern his creature man <HI>without a free Covenant;</HI> (if he had been plea&s;ed &s;o to do,) has neverthele&s;s conde&s;cended to include all his po&s;itive <HI>Laws</HI> in two expre&s;s <HI>legal Covenants,</HI> the <HI>old</HI> and the <HI>new,</HI> both of which have been from time to time confirmed and fulfilled, and &s;till re&s;pectively &s;ub&s;i&s;t to this day in all points, wherein the former is not &s;uper&s;eded, and fulfilled by the latter. It therefore ill becomes this learned Civilian to &s;eparate the idea of a <HI>Compact</HI> or <HI>Covenant from Law;</HI> and more e&s;pecially when he endeavours thereby to e&s;tabli&s;h <Q><HI>the Power of the

<P>Thus I hope I have traced, to the very foundation, the Baron's error in denying the principle or maxim beforementioned, (concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of popular <HI>a&s;|&s;ent</HI> in Legi&s;lation,) for, if he had not attempted to &s;eparate the idea of a <HI>Coven|nant</HI> from <HI>Law,</HI> he could not have over|looked the ab&s;olute <HI>illegality</HI> of tho&s;e pretended Laws which are ordained only by the <HI>Will</HI> and <HI><Q>Power of the Exac|tor!</Q></HI> becau&s;e the meane&s;t profe&s;&s;or of the Engli&s;h common Law would have told him, that every &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, <HI>promi&s;e,</HI> or <HI>agreement,</HI> that is <HI>extorted</HI> by <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>compul&s;ion,</HI> is (according to the <HI>Law of Nature</HI>) totally <HI>null and void in it&s;elf;</HI> and he him&s;elf is &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of this in another place<NOTE N="(10)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Tho&s;e <HI>promi&s;es</HI> then, or <HI>pacts,</HI> we take to be <HI>invalid,</HI> which a man is <HI>compelled</HI> to engage in, by the <HI>unju&s;t force</HI> of the party to whom they are made; for &s;ince he, who <HI>extorts</HI> any thing from another by u&s;ing unju&s;t terrours, is <HI>by the Law of Nature</HI> bound to re&s;tore it, and mu&s;t con&s;equently make good what the other per&s;on lo&s;es by &s;uch forced bargain, the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Reparation,</HI> in the party who offered the violence, <HI>takes off</HI> ALL OBLIGATION <HI>to payment in the party who &s;uffered it,</HI> &amp;c. <BIBL>Book 3. c. 6. &sect; 11. p. 225.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. And, even if
<PB N="xx" REF="22">an oath &s;hould be obtained to confirm the unju&s;t <HI>"Power of the Exactor,"</HI> it will not increa&s;e his Right; for the Ba|ron's own doctrine (again in another part of his book) affords a &s;ufficient an|&s;wer to annul every pretence of <HI>Obliga|tion</HI> on account of <Q><HI>oaths extorted by un|ju&s;t Fear</HI> <NOTE N="(11)" PLACE="foot"><Q>But what are we to think of <HI>oaths</HI> extorted by <HI>unju&s;t Fear?</HI> Surely the Per&s;on who, by means of this <HI>Fear,</HI> procured a promi&s;e <HI>upon oath,</HI> is no le&s;s obliged to <HI>relea&s;e the promi&s;e,</HI> thus violently obtained, than <HI>if no oath had been</HI> added to confirm it. There|fore there appears no rea&s;on, why <HI>Compen&s;ation</HI> &s;hould not be admitted in this ca&s;e, in oppo&s;ition to <HI>the Claim</HI> of the <HI>injurious Party;</HI> according to the rules laid down by us</Q> (&s;ays he) <Q>when we treated of the general &s;ubject of <HI>Fear.</HI> <BIBL>Book 4. c. 2. &sect; 8. p. 272.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the maxim concerning <HI>the nece&s;|&s;ity of A&s;&s;ent,</HI> for which I contend, is &s;ufficiently proved to be a <HI>Law of Na|ture</HI> even by the learned Baron's own arguments, and I de&s;ire no better.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the Baron's gene|ral mi&s;conception<NOTE N="(12)" PLACE="foot"><P>I have &s;pent the more time in warning my Rea|ders again&s;t the Errors of this celebrated Civilian, be|cau&s;e the &s;tudying of his Works (I am informed) is at this time con&s;idered as a material part of Education in our Univer&s;ities; &s;o that <HI>the ri&s;ing Generation</HI> of the very be&s;t Families in this Kingdom are liable to im|bibe (as it were with the Milk of In&s;truction) the&s;e poi&s;onous Doctrines, which thereby become fixed and engrafted in their tender minds as a <HI>foundation</HI> for their <HI>future political Principles!</HI></P>

<PB N="xxi" REF="23">of <HI>agreement</HI> to make Laws valid, he has a&s;&s;erted al&s;o, <Q>that neither the <HI>divine po&s;itive Laws,</HI> nor the <HI>Laws of Nature,</HI> had their ri&s;e from the <HI>agree|ment of men,</HI></Q> &amp;c. <BIBL>Book 1. c. 6. &sect;. 2. p. 47.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>(COPY.) EXTRACT of a LETTER on the foregoing Subject, to a Friend in AMERICA, dated Febru|ary 21, 1774.</HEAD>
<P><GAP DESC="blank">I have al&s;o &s;ent you a book lately pub|li&s;hed by Dr. &mdash;, re&s;pecting the go|vernment of the Briti&s;h Colonies.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of my &s;ending the latter is not becau&s;e I approve of it, or have the
<PB N="34" REF="76">lea&s;t connexion with the author; but, on the contrary, that you and your friends in America may be aware of the uncon|&s;titutional doctrines which are thereby propagated among&s;t us. I have not, in|deed, had opportunity to peru&s;e it re|gularly; neither do I now think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to do &s;o; for I was lucky enough, when I fir&s;t took it up, to turn over a few pages in the fourth part, containing five propo&s;itions upon the point in que&s;|tion, whereby the author's &s;entiments and intentions may be &s;ufficiently known without de&s;cending to his arguments up|on them; for <HI>not one</HI> of them (not even the 5th and la&s;t, which he him&s;elf pre|fers) can po&s;&s;ibly be reconciled either to <HI>Law, Equity,</HI> or <HI>&s;ound Politicks;</HI> &s;o that if the doctor, with the <HI>&s;ame neglect of Law and con&s;titutional Principles,</HI> had multiplied his propo&s;itions to the number of <HI>an hundred times five,</HI> he would not have been able to lay down a plan or
<PB N="35" REF="77">mode of government tolerably &s;uitable to the ca&s;e before him; becau&s;e, in this, as in many other things, there is but, <HI>one right,</HI> though very many <HI>wrong</HI> me|thods of proceeding; and the doctor has unfortunately forgot to &s;tate the <HI>only right propo&s;ition</HI> upon the &s;ubject in que&s;tion, that can be admitted con&s;i&s;tently with the nece&s;&s;ary principles abovementioned of <HI>Law, Equity, and &s;ound Politicks;</HI> viz. to <HI>do ju&s;tice</HI> to our brethren of A|merica; that is, to govern them accord|ing to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Principles of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, and known Laws of the Land, and candidly to acknow|ledge their <HI>unalienable</HI> right to the &s;ame happy privileges by which the liberties of the mother-country have hitherto been maintained; the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential of which is the privilege of paying no other taxes than what are voluntarily granted by <HI>the people</HI> or their <HI>legal repre&s;entatives</HI> in general councils or parliaments.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="78">Dr.&mdash;is inexcu&s;able for having o|mitted this <HI>&s;ixth Propo&s;ition!</HI> for he can|not be ignorant of the legal and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of extending the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution to countries detached from this i&s;land,</HI> be|cau&s;e we have a &s;tanding precedent and example (which has long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and has been univer&s;ally allowed) in the pre&s;ent government of <HI>Ireland;</HI> for that i&s;land, though unju&s;tly <HI>conquered</HI> by our ance&s;|tors, enjoys (or, at lea&s;t, is allowed to be entitled to) the &s;ame con&s;titutional privileges as the &s;eat of empire, England it&s;elf. The re&s;pective Parliaments of the two i&s;lands are <HI>entirely independent of each other;</HI> they <HI>&s;eparately</HI> grant, from time to time, the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies to the &s;tate; and no man may pre&s;ume to deny their right of enquiring re&s;pectively into the application of them. But, not|with&s;tanding this di&s;tinct oeconomy, and the entire independency of the natives or
<PB N="37" REF="79">&s;ubjects, with re&s;pect to each other, yet they are firmly united, by the <HI>bands of allegiance,</HI> to <HI>one</HI> Head (or Monarchy) of <HI>limited power,</HI> whereby they enjoy the privileges of the <HI>&s;ame rea&s;onable common Law,</HI> and the <HI>&s;ame excellent Con&s;titution</HI> of &s;tate: &s;o that the equality of <HI>privilege</HI> and <HI>condition</HI> renders the <HI>Union</HI> more ju&s;t and equitable, and con&s;equently more &s;afe and durable, than it could po&s;&s;ibly have been made by any other means.</P>
<P>And the inhabitants of both i&s;lands (though &s;prung from a variety of jarring, jealous, and fierce nations) have, by this means, acquired a certain <HI>mutual con&s;ideration</HI> for each other, as <HI>fellow-&s;ubjects,</HI> which could never have been produced by mere alliances, guarantees, or defen&s;ive leagues, nor perhaps by any other mode of government whatever, than that by which Divine Providence has effected it; <HI>viz.</HI> the Engli&s;h Con|&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="80">This has firmly united the <HI>&s;trength</HI> of the two i&s;lands; whereby reciprocal &s;uc|cour in time of need is in&s;ured to both. This <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed example</HI> of the true con|&s;titutional mode of connecting Briti&s;h Dominions, that are otherwi&s;e &s;eparated by Nature, will enable us, by compari|&s;on, to di&s;cern the illegality and inju&s;tice of Dr.&mdash;'s five Propo&s;itions. The &s;tately vine of Briti&s;h Dominion (if I may u&s;e that &s;criptural type) has pro|videntially extended its luxuriant branches to the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the earth! and will continue to &s;pread and increa&s;e as long as <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>the Laws of Li|berty</HI> are duly maintained by tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of government (unle&s;s the wickedne&s;s of <HI>individuals,</HI> manife&s;ted by the exerci&s;e of <HI>dome&s;tic Slavery</HI> and <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> in the Co|lonies, and of <HI>political Corruption and Venality</HI> at home, with the <HI>growing vices</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="81">attending <HI>both</HI> re&s;pectively, &s;hould un|happily draw down God's vengeance upon us! and perhaps our mutual pu|ni&s;hment is at this time impending in the pre&s;ent differences and ignorance of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution): But how will the trunk or &s;tock of the Briti&s;h Vine appear, if we &s;hould entirely &s;eparate or lop off the branches?&mdash;The American Branches are already <HI>detached,</HI> indeed, (in point of di&s;tance,) and widely &s;epa|rated from the Trunk, by a va&s;t Ocean, but the imperial Crown of Great-Britain is, neverthele&s;s, a &s;ufficient band of u|nion or connexion between them, it be|ing the legal en&s;ign of authority for the maintenance and execution of the &s;ame ju&s;t laws, the influence of which may, by a due con&s;titutional exertion of the regal Power, be circulated, like whole|&s;ome &s;ap, from the root to the mo&s;t di&s;|tant branches.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="82">But if (according to Dr.&mdash;'s 5th propo&s;ition) the flouri&s;hing branches of North-America were to be <HI>entirely &s;epa|rated</HI> from the trunk, and excluded from the <HI>circle</HI> of the royal <HI>diadem,</HI> the effect would be <HI>reciprocally humiliating;</HI> for the act of &s;eparation would, at the &s;ame time, unavoidably <HI>contract</HI> the <HI>imperial Authority of the Briti&s;h Empire</HI> to the narrow limits of Briti&s;h and Iri&s;h ground, except a few &s;mall Sugar-I&s;lands, peo|pled chiefly by the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of &s;laves: &s;o that both <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her <HI>Colonies</HI> would reciprocally lo&s;e <HI>im|portance, &s;trength,</HI> and <HI>&s;ecurity,</HI> by the di&s;union. A Guarantee of independence again&s;t all foreign invaders, as propo&s;ed by Dr.&mdash;, would fall far &s;hort of the effect which we enjoy by the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, becau&s;e it would not, like the latter, produce that <HI>mutual con&s;idera|tion and protection</HI> which are due from
<PB N="41" REF="83"><HI>fellow-&s;ubjects.</HI> Our connexion, accord|ing to the doctor's mea&s;ure, would be upon no better footing than Alliances of the &s;ame kind with detached foreign Powers, which (as experience teaches us) &s;ub&s;i&s;t no longer than the <HI>private in|tere&s;t</HI> or <HI>&s;eparate</HI> views of the contracting parties.</P>
<P>If all the&s;e points are duly con&s;idered, the very propo&s;ing &s;o pernicious a mea|&s;ure mu&s;t appear highly criminal, if not trea&s;onable! e&s;pecially as the author has been plea&s;ed to in&s;inuate, that there is no alternative!&mdash; <Q>If we neither can govern the Americans,</Q> (&s;ays he,) <Q>nor be governed by them; if we can neither unite with them, nor ought to &s;ubdue them; what remains</Q> (&s;ays he) <Q>but to part with them on as friendly terms as we can?</Q> But is it not Trea|&s;on again&s;t the Crown to in&s;inuate that the Americans cannot be <HI>governed,</HI> as
<PB N="42" REF="84">well as Trea&s;on again&s;t the People at large, to &s;ay that we cannot <HI>unite</HI> with our American Brethren, when there is a con&s;titutional mode both of <HI>Government</HI> and <HI>Union,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, and an unque&s;tionable precedent, the ob&s;ervance of which would undoubtedly &s;atisfy every hone&s;t American Subject?</P>
<P>The advocates for the juri&s;diction of the Briti&s;h <HI>Parliament in America,</HI> like all promoters of bad mea&s;ures, will not fail to repre&s;ent tho&s;e, that oppo&s;e them, as licentious and di&s;affected per&s;ons; and therefore, as it is highly nece&s;&s;ary for the general <HI>welfare</HI> and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the Briti&s;h Empire, both in Europe, A&s;ia, and America, (upon the principles already explained,) that we &s;hould &s;trictly main|tain our <HI>Loyalty to the Crown,</HI> at the &s;ame time that we &s;teadily a&s;&s;ert our le|gal and con&s;titutional Rights,&mdash;I think we ought to lo&s;e no proper opportunity
<PB N="43" REF="85">of expre&s;&s;ing our <HI>per&s;onal attachment</HI> to the <HI>King and the royal Family,</HI> who, in them&s;elves, indeed are truly amiable, and worthy of e&s;teem; but it is very diffi|cult, in this world, to guard again&s;t mi&s;repre&s;entation and bad advice; how|ever, I tru&s;t that a &s;teady per&s;everance in <HI>Love and Duty</HI> will be the true means of your prevailing in the end, as it will prove that your oppo&s;ition is not occa|&s;ioned either by di&s;affection or di&s;loyalty, but is <HI>truly legal</HI> and <HI>con&s;titutional.</HI></P>

<P>WHEN the Fir&s;t Part of this De|claration was &s;ent to the Pre&s;s, I was not aware that there had been any con|trover&s;y before the &s;ixth of King <HI>George</HI> I. concerning the freedom of our fellow &s;ubjects in <HI>Ireland,</HI> or that any Engli&s;h|man, acquainted with the principles of

Whereupon the &s;aid A. was warned and appeared, and &s;aid, 'That the <HI>land of Ireland, time beyond the memory of man, hath been a land &s;eparated and &s;evered from the Realm of England,</HI> and ruled and <HI>governed by the cu&s;toms and laws of the &s;ame land of Ireland.</HI> And that the Lords of the &s;ame land, which are of the King's Council, have u&s;ed, from time to time in the <HI>ab&s;ence of the King, to elect a Ju&s;tice,</HI> which Ju&s;tice, &s;o elected, hath power to pardon and puni&s;h all felo|nies, tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c. and to a&s;&s;emble a Parliament;</HI> and by the advice of the Lords and <HI>Commonalty to make Statutes; and he alledgeth further,</HI> that a Parliament was a&s;&s;embled, and that it was ordained by the &s;aid Parliament, that every man who had any office with|in the &s;aid land, before a certain day, <HI>and he puts the day in certain.</HI> &s;hall occupy the &s;aid Office by him&s;elf, or otherwi&s;e that he &s;hall forfeit his office. <HI>And &s;heweth further,</HI> how the &s;aid John Pilkington oc|cupied the &s;aid office by a deputy, and that, in&s;o|much as he came not in proper per&s;on to re&s;ide upon his office before the day, that his office was void,
<PB N="61" REF="100">and that the King, by his Letters Patents, granted the &s;aid office, &s;o become void, to the &s;aid A. and prayed that the &s;aid Letters Patents &s;hould be effec|tual, and not repealed.' And upon the plea the &s;aid John Pilkington demurred in law. In the ar|gument of which ca&s;e, it was debated by the Judges, Yelverton, Forte&s;cue, Portington, Markham, and A&s;cough, whether the &s;aid pre&s;cription were good, or void in law; Yelverton and Portington held the pre&s;cription void; <HI>but Forte&s;ine, Markham, and A&s;|cough,</HI> held the pre&s;cription good, and that the <HI>Let|ters Patents made to A. were good and effectual,</HI> and ought not to be repeated: and in the argument of this ca&s;e it was agreed, by Forte&s;cue and Portington, <HI>that if a tenth or fifteenth be granted by Parliament in England,</HI> that &s;hall not <HI>bind them in Ireland;</HI> although the King &s;end the &s;ame <HI>Statute into Ireland under his great &s;eal: except they in Ireland will in their Parlia|ment approve it;</HI> but if they will <HI>approve it, then it &s;hall bind in Ireland.</HI> And Portington &s;aid, that if a tenth be granted in the Parliament of England, <HI>that &s;hall not bind in Ireland,</HI> becau&s;e they have not any <HI>commandment by writ to come to our Parliament;</HI> and this was not denied by Markham, Yelverton, or A&s;cough. Upon this ca&s;e the&s;e points following are to be ob&s;erved, Fir&s;t, that the Lords of the Council of Ireland had then power, in the <HI>ab&s;ence of the King, and vacancy of a Lieutenant or Deputy, to elect a Ju&s;tice.</HI> and that is plainly proved by the preamble of the Statutes of 33d of Hen. VIII. chap. 2. in Ireland. The words are the&s;e; 'For as much as continually

<P>But Lord Coke has unfortunately ne|glected to weigh the importance of this ju&s;t <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and con&s;equently has been led to mi&s;con&s;true the doctrine to which it has at different times been applied by the Judges; for, in Calvin's Ca&s;e, (7th Rep. p. 447.) he cites the opinion of the Judges in 2d Rich. III. beforementioned, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That Ireland hath a Parliament, and they make laws, <HI>and our Statutes do not bind them:</HI></Q> and he cites al&s;o their rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>becau&s;e they do not

But then this was always by their proper Repre&s;en|tatives: For we find, that in the Reign of Edward the Third, and by what foregoes, it is plain it <HI>was &s;o in Edward the Fir&s;t's time; Knights of the Shire, Citizens, and Burge&s;&s;es, were elected in the Shires, Ci|ties, and Boroughs of Ireland, to &s;erve in Parliament in England;</HI> and have &s;o &s;erved accordingly. For, among&s;t the records of the Tower of London, Roe. Clau&s;. 50. Edward the Third, Parl. 2. Memb. 23. we find a writ from the King at We&s;tmin&s;ter, di|rected to James Butler, Lord Ju&s;tice of Ireland, and to R. Archbi&s;hop of Dublin, his Chancellor, re|quiring them to i&s;&s;ue writs, under the great Seal of Ireland, to the &s;everal Counties, Cities, and Bo|roughs, for &s;atisfying the expences of the men of that land, who la&s;t came over to &s;erve in Parliament in England. And, in another roll, the 50th of Edw. III. Membr. 19. on complaint to the King by John Draper, who was cho&s;en Burge&s;s of Cork by writ, and &s;erved in the Parliament of England, and yet was denied his expences by &s;ome of the Citizens, care was taken to reimbur&s;e him.</P>
<P>If, from the&s;e la&s;t mentioned records, it be con|cluded that the Parliament of England may bind Ireland; it mu&s;t al&s;o be allowed, that the people of Ireland ought to have their Repre&s;entatives in the Parliament of England.

<P>This &s;ending of Repre&s;entatives out of Ireland to the Parliament in England, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, was found in proce&s;s of time to be very trouble&s;ome and inconvenient; and this we may pre&s;ume was the rea&s;on that, afterwards, when times were more &s;ettled, we fell again into our old track and regu|lar cour&s;e of Parliaments in our own country; and hereupon the laws afore-noted, page 64, were en|acted, e&s;tabli&s;hing, that <HI>no law made in the Parliament of England &s;hould be of force in Ireland, till it was al|lowed and publi&s;hed in Parliament here.</HI></P></NOTE>; which an|cient

<P>It is too true, indeed, that our Kings, in general, did not think them&s;elves "<HI>obliged,</HI> by the&s;e Statutes," (as they ought in con&s;cience to have been, for the &s;afety 
<PB N="161" REF="200">of their &s;ouls,) "to call <HI>a new Parliament every year:</HI>" nay, it is certain that many of them would never have called a Parliament at all, had they not been <HI>"obliged"</HI> by nece&s;&s;ity and the circum&s;tances of the times. But by what authority could a repre&s;entative in one Parliament take his &s;eat in the <HI>next annual Parliament,</HI> without <HI>re|election,</HI> before any laws were made for lengthening the duration of Parliaments? And be&s;ides, if the King did "<HI>only permit</HI> a Parliament to &s;it annually," <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by what authority could the Parliament be convened at all, under &s;uch a circum&s;tance, &s;eeing that a <HI>mere per|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;it</HI> excludes the idea of a prorogation from year to year? However, the learned Commentator him&s;elf very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, in a preceding page, (150,) con|cerning "the manner and time of a&s;&s;embling" that the <Q>Parliament is regularly to be &s;ummoned by the King's <HI>Writ</HI> or Letter, i&s;&s;ued out of Chancery.</Q> And it is well known that the&s;e Writs are not addre&s;&s;ed to the knights, citizens, and burge&s;&s;es, elected for any <HI>for|mer</HI> Parliament, but to <HI>the Sheriffs alone,</HI> to cau&s;e <HI>Kinghts, Citizens, &amp;c. to be elected;</HI> for, when the &s;aid Acts were made, &s;uch an ab&s;urdity in politics had never been conceived in England, as that of entru&s;ting the <HI>Repre|&s;entation</HI> of the people, for <HI>a term of years,</HI> (as at pre|&s;ent,) to the per&s;ons elected! On the contrary, when the bu&s;ine&s;s of each Se&s;&s;ions was fini&s;hed, the Parlia|ment, of cour&s;e, was at an end; and therefore Lord Coke did not &s;peak in vain, when he mentioned <HI>"the 
<PB N="162" REF="201">excellent Law"</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> the Act for <HI>annual</HI> Parliaments) <HI>"being applied to the &s;aid Writs of Parliament,"</HI> &amp;c. be|fore recited.</P>
<P>A man of &s;o much good-&s;en&s;e, learning, and judge|ment, as Sir William Black&s;tone is ma&s;ter of, mu&s;t be well aware of the pernicious effects of inve&s;ting the Repre&s;entatives of the people with a legi&s;lative power, beyond the con&s;titutional term of A SINGLE SESSION, without <HI>Re-election;</HI> and therefore I cannot but be &s;ur|prized at the unguarded manner in which he has ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in his Comment on the two <HI>excellent Statutes</HI> of Edward III. for <HI>annual</HI> Parliaments; <HI>viz.</HI> that the King is not,<Q>or ever was, obliged by the&s;e Statutes to call a <HI>new</HI> Parliament every year,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He has cau&s;ed the word <HI>new</HI> to be printed in <HI>Italies,</HI> as if he meant thereby to in&s;inuate, that the Legi&s;latures of tho&s;e early times were not unacquainted with our modern idea of conferring on the popular Repre&s;enta|tives a kind of <HI>continued &s;enatorial dignity,</HI> without <HI>Re-election,</HI> for &s;everal years together; whereas he certainly mu&s;t have known that this corrupt <HI>modorn</HI> practice has produced a <HI>new order</HI> of men among&s;t us a mo&s;t dangerous increa&s;e of ari&s;tocratical power, which was entirely unknown to our Ance&s;tors in the glorious reign of Edward III. If he could &s;hew that there <HI>ever</HI> was a Parliament, in tho&s;e times, that was <HI>not a</HI> NEW <HI>Parliament,</HI> his Comment might be ju&s;ti|fied! But it is notorious that Writs were i&s;&s;ued to the Sheriffs, for <HI>new</HI> Elections, almo&s;t <HI>every year</HI> du|ring that whole reign: The Writs, for the mo&s;t part, 
<PB N="163" REF="202">are &s;till pre&s;erved with the Returns upon them. In the catalogue of Election-Writs, which Prynn has given in his <HI>Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva,</HI> p. 4 to 6, there is an account of Writs i&s;&s;ued for <HI>new</HI> Elections in every year of that King's reign, between his 34th (when the la&s;t Act for annual Parliaments was made) and his 50th year, except 3, <HI>viz.</HI> the 40th, 41&s;t, and 48th years; in which years the Records of Summons to the Prelates and Lords of Parliament are al&s;o want|ing, as appears by Sir William Dugdale's <Q>perfect Co|py of Summons to Parliament, of the Nobility,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And yet this affords no ab&s;olute proof that Parliaments were not held <HI>in tho&s;e very years</HI> for which the Writs are wanting; becau&s;e the bundles of Writs for the &s;aid years may have been lo&s;t or mi&s;laid. The only wonder is, that more have not been ab&s;olutely lo&s;t, when we con&s;ider the very little care that had been taken of them; for Prynne found many of the&s;e Writs di&s;per&s;ed among&s;t a va&s;t mi&s;cellaneous heap of other records on various &s;ubjects, (as he him&s;elf relates in his Epi&s;tle-Dedicatory to King Charles II. of his <HI>Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva,</HI>) calling the &s;aid heap a <Q><HI>confu&s;ed Chaos,</HI> under cor|roding, putrifying cobwebs, du&s;t, and filth, in the darke&s;t corner of Cae&s;ar's Chapel in the White Tower, as <HI>mere u&s;ele&s;s Reliques not worthy to be calendred,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And, in page 103 of that &s;ame work, he &s;peaks of 117 Bundles of Writs, whereof 97 had only been then <HI>lately</HI> di&s;covered, filed, and bundled, by him&s;elf: "But many of the&s;e 117 Bundles" (&s;ays he) <Q>are 
<PB N="164" REF="203"><HI>not compleat,</HI> above half or three parts of the Writs being either rotted, con&s;umed, maymed, torn, or <HI>utterly lo&s;t,</HI> through carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, wet, cankers, or other ca&s;ualties; and &s;ome of them have not above two, three, or four Writs, and one or two but one Writ and Retorn remaining.</Q></P>
<P>But that there were really Writs for Parliaments, even in tho&s;e <HI>three</HI> years, which appear to be wanting, at lea&s;t in <HI>two</HI> of them, is very certain; becau&s;e it was in the 40th year of this reign, as Sir Edward Coke informs us, (4 In&s;t. p. 13,) that the Pope demanded homage for the kingdoms of England and Ireland, and the arrears of revenue granted by King John to Pope Innocent III. <Q>whereupon the King, in the <HI>&s;ame year, calleth his Court of Parliament,</HI></Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In this Parliament it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, by the Prelates, Dukes, Counts, Barons, and the <HI>Commons,</HI> ("et <HI>la Common,</HI>" and again, <HI>"at Communes,"</HI>) <Q>that the &s;aid King John, nor no other, could put him&s;elf, nor his Realm, nor his People, in &s;uch Subjec|tion, without <HI>their A&s;&s;ent,</HI> ('&s;ans a&s;&s;ent de eux;') and, if it was done, it was done without their A&s;&s;ent,</Q> (that is, without the A&s;&s;ent of the <HI>Commons,</HI> for the A&s;&s;ent of the Barons was expre&s;&s;ed in the Charter,) "and contrary to his Oath at his Coronation" P. 14.

See the margin, 4th In&s;t. p. 13.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="204">And it appears that a Parliament was held al&s;o in the 48th year of this reign, becau&s;e &s;upplies were in that year granted to the King by Parliament, as re|lated by Sir Richard Baker, in his Chronicle, p. 173, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>in his eight and fortieth year,</HI> IN A PARLIA|MENT, is granted him a 10th of the Clergy, and a 15th of the Laity.</Q> So that there is but <HI>one</HI> year, out of &s;o many, in which we cannot trace the meeting of the annual Parliaments: And annual Writs for <HI>new</HI> Elections were regularly i&s;&s;ued for the fir&s;t 18 years of the following reign, (as appears by Prynn's <Q>2d part of a brief Regi&s;ter and Survey of the &s;everal kinds and forms of parliamentary Writs,</Q> pages 116 and 117,) till Richard II.

<P>After con&s;idering the&s;e unque&s;tionable evidences of the i&s;&s;uing Writs <HI>annually</HI> for <HI>new</HI> Elections, it will be difficult to comprehend the meaning of Sir William Black&s;tone's Comment on the &s;aid two Acts for <HI>annual</HI> Parliaments: <Q>Not that he (the King) is, or ever was, obliged by the&s;e Statutes to call a <HI>new</HI> Parlia|ment every year; but only to permit a Parliament to &s;it annually for the redre&s;s of grievances and di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>if need be.</HI> &mdash; The&s;e la&s;t words</Q>

<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation, I am inclined to think, is equally applicable, as well to the candour and di&s;po&s;ition, as to the writings, of Sir William Black&s;tone, who&s;e very learned and u&s;eful Commen|taries mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;trictly examined, upon this point, before I conclude my Declaration: and, had the other great and eminent writers (Lord Coke, Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Vaughan, Judge Jenkins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) who&s;e opinions, upon the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, I am obliged al&s;o to call in que&s;|tion, been &s;till alive, I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf equally &s;ure of their be|nevolence and forgivene&s;s, if I except Serjeant Mayart; becau&s;e the unde&s;erved contempt, with which he has treated Sir Richard Bolton, (the learned Author whom he attempted to an&s;wer,) prevents
