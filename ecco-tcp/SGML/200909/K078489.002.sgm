<SALUTE>Dear <HI>Melmoth,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM ju&s;t at this pre&s;ent Minute in as bad a Humour for Letter-writing, as any private Gentle|man need be. You &s;ee I confine my&s;elf to Privates, for State&s;men and Secretaries methinks &s;hould be allowed &s;ome greater Degree of La|titude for their Di&s;plea&s;ures on this Head, as being more perpetually tormented with it. You'll find by my Date, where my Quarters are. I have been here about a Week, ju&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="4">
Time enough to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Recep|tion of your Brother, who arrived but a Day after me. He was fol|lowed on Tue&s;day la&s;t by two maiden Aunts of Sir <HI>Thorobred</HI>'s, who live together at <HI>York,</HI> and were &s;o obliging as to favour <HI>Foxhall</HI> with their Company 'till this Morning, when they left us, which I believe their ungracious Nephew is not very &s;orry for. What a Tribe of Aunts he has! Two at <HI>York,</HI> two at <HI>Wood&s;tock;</HI> all Virgins; and a fifth at la&s;t married and &s;ettled in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> after having lived in fear of the Apes for above the&s;e twenty Years.</P>
<P>I &s;pent an incomparable Evening ye&s;terday, which perhaps you would not have &s;u&s;pected, when you hear who were our Party. It con&s;i&s;ted of Mi&s;s <HI>Rugg,</HI> her two Aunts afore|&s;aid,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
your Brother, &s;trongly con|tra&s;ted by <HI>Tom Fetlock,</HI> (who is now in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Living) the Baronet and My&s;elf. Sir <HI>Thorobred</HI> having tired him&s;elf with Lunging a young Stone-hor&s;e in the Morn|ing, &s;uffer'd the Conver&s;ation to turn upon general Topics and New&s;paper Intelligences, only re|&s;erving to him&s;elf the Liberty of putting in a Sentence now and then as he thought proper. Having di&s;|patched the common Bu&s;ine&s;s of Weather, and remarked, without Reflection, that &s;uch a day had been exce&s;&s;ive cold, or inten&s;ely hot, or wet, or dry, or neither, without any Regard to the Matter of Fact, which indeed was not nece&s;&s;ary, as the acquie&s;cing Spirit of the Com|pany entirely agreed in whatever
<PB N="4" REF="6">
the fir&s;t Per&s;on advanced, however the Common Sen&s;e and Acceptation of Words might &s;uffer by their Politene&s;s; we proceeded to touch a little upon <HI>American</HI> Matters, and the Behaviour of a late Reverend Criminal at his Execution, Alas, poor Doctor! cried Aunt <HI>Dorothy,</HI> (who for &s;ome Time had been nod|ding over her Snuff-Box, whil&s;t the Combination of Snivel and Rappee &s;treamed its Chocolate Defluxions down her Handkerchief;) Poor Man! Well, they &s;ay he made a fine End! Why, my dear Madam, cried Sir <HI>Thorobred,</HI> yawning, He entered at the Po&s;t, didn't he, and I'm told there was a dead Heat. Tho' &s;ome indeed pretend that he was &s;muggled over to <HI>France,</HI> which I don't believe a Word of. Why
<PB N="5" REF="7">
I was there, &s;ays <HI>Fetlock,</HI> (who af|fects to be a Cock-fighter,) and I never in my Life &s;aw any Man die better Game than he did; aye, and &s;truck to the la&s;t. To be &s;ure he wheel'd at fir&s;t a little, but &s;ay what they will, your wheeling Cocks always fight the be&s;t Battle. What &s;ay you, <HI>Thorobred?</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Rugg</HI> &s;miled, the old Ladies &s;niffed and wiped their No&s;es, and the Captain relaxing his Features agreeably, took out his Toothpick-ca&s;e and began playing with the Contents of it.</P>
<P>I have told you that I arrived here about a Week ago, but have not mentioned a Mi&s;take I had nearly fallen into. On getting out of my Chai&s;e, I &s;aw a tall young Fellow &s;tanding in the Yard, with
<PB N="6" REF="8">
dark Hair cropt &s;hort, a narrow-brimm'd Round-Hat bound with black Ferret upon his Head, and his <HI>tout En&s;emble</HI> exactly corre&s;|ponding with my Ideas of a Groom or a Stable-boy. Not happening to think of <HI>Fetlock,</HI> I was ju&s;t me|ditating a Salutation of "Holla my Lady," to a&s;k his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in bringing in my Luggage, when he turned round, and thereby &s;aved me an Infinity of Confu&s;ion and Apo|logies, which I &s;hould otherwi&s;e Infallibly have intailed upon my&s;elf. His Dre&s;s was a light Grey Coat with black Buttons, an outer Wai&s;t|coat of green and white &s;triped Cotton, under which, as it was open at the Brea&s;t, I could de&s;cry at lea&s;t &s;even Flannel ones faced with as many Scraps of different coloured
<PB N="7" REF="9">
Sattins; a Pair of Fu&s;tian Breeches with a Profu&s;ion of String at the Kneebands, white thread Stockings, a coloured Silk Handkerchief round his Neck, and an Hook'd-Stick in his Hand.</P>
<P>Having &s;uppre&s;&s;ed my intended Exclamation, I acco&s;ted him as a Gentleman, and made &s;ome feeble Efforts towards entering into an equine Conver&s;ation; which how|ever I &s;oon found my utter Incapa|city of Supporting, being in le&s;s than five Minutes &s;o completely be|wildered with a Variety of Cant Phra&s;es and Technical Terms, that I was obliged to change the Subject for one more generally Intelligible. During this Time Sir <HI>Thorobred</HI> was at &s;ome Di&s;tance in a Field, earne&s;tly examining the Heel of one
<PB N="8" REF="10">
of his Hunters, which <HI>Fetlock</HI> told me was gorged a little; and as he was upon his Hands and Knees with his Hair hanging loo&s;e about his Shoulders, he exhibited methought no unapt Repre&s;entation of King <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> at Gra&s;s, towards the End of his &s;even Years Meta|morpho&s;is. Nor was the Similitude at all dimini&s;hed by his nearer Ap|proach to us. For <Q>his Dwelling had been with the Bea&s;ts of the Field, and his Body was wet with the Dew of Heaven, and his Beard was grown like Eagles Feathers, and his Nails like Birds Claws.</Q></P>
<P>Upon his coming up to us, I re|ceived from him an hone&s;t, hearty, downright Welcome, exemplified, or rather expre&s;&s;ed by a violent Blow
<PB N="9" REF="11">
on the Shoulder, and &s;uch a Shake by the Hand, as expo&s;ed the Oeco|nomy of my Bones and Cartilages to intolerable Jeopardy, and which indeed nothing but the Extremity of Friend&s;hip would have induced me to &s;ubmit to, as his Paws were by no means exempt from the Na&s;tine&s;s attendant on Farriery. Having, however, &s;urvived the Sa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tation without material Injury, we all three adjourned to his Study, as he has thought proper to denomi|nate it. And indeed, upon Reflection, I think he has much Rea&s;on on his Side, tho' probably without being &s;en&s;ible of it. <HI>Cicero,</HI> if you remember, defines Studium, or Study, to be the Attention and Ap|plication of the Mind to &s;ome one particular Object. And therefore,
<PB N="10" REF="12">
tho' the Name of a Study, or Re|po&s;itory for &s;uch Things as may a&s;&s;i&s;t us in this Pur&s;uit, u&s;ually conveys the Idea of a Room parti|cularly devoted to Books and Lite|rature, ina&s;much as the Studium of the generality of People tends that Way; yet it is equally applicable to a Room equipp'd in any Manner what&s;oever, provided that Manner bears the &s;ame Affinity to the Stu|dium of its Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Whether our Friend's did, you &s;hall be your own Judge. The Size of the Room you know is &s;mall, with two Win|dows, a Door and a Fire-place. The literary Part of its Furniture con&s;i&s;ted of a pretty con&s;iderable Quantity of old New&s;papers, Ma|gazines, Racing Calendars, and Li&s;ts of Running Hor&s;es; which
<PB N="11" REF="13">
entirely occupied the Window Seats, and invellop'd the greate&s;t Part of the Floor. On his Table was a <HI>Bartlett</HI>'s Farriery garni&s;hed with Spurs, Spur-leathers and a Boot|jack; and the Remains of <HI>Euclid</HI>'s Elements without a Cover, which he informed me was going the Way of all its Univer&s;ity Companions, being con&s;tantly made U&s;e of at his Cloacinean Sacrifices. His Chimney was decorated with Jockey Whips perpendicularly &s;u&s;pended from their Thongs, and every other Part of the Walls &s;eemed loaded with an a&s;toni&s;hing Variety of Curbs, Snaffles, Cave&s;&s;ons and Mar|tingals, with five thou&s;and other In&s;truments of Eque&s;trian Utility, full as curious and entertaining to me, as the Weapons of <HI>New Zea|land</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="14">
or <HI>Otaheite,</HI> or the old Bando|leers and Shot Pouches in the Ar|moury in the <HI>Tower.</HI> As it wanted &s;ome Hours to Dinner, we agreed that a Bottle of Strong Beer and &s;ome Slices of cold Ham would not be un&s;ea&s;onable. The&s;e were procured, and di&s;patched &s;peedily; after which I retired to Dre&s;s my|&s;elf, as did my two Companions to try a young Hor&s;e of <HI>Fetlock</HI>'s at the Leaping Bar.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Rugg</HI> and your Brother &s;eem to find each other exceedingly agree|able, and if I may pre&s;ume to pro|phe&s;y, will not be aver&s;e in due Time to a Junction of Forces. The Captain's Method of Attack is not of the mo&s;t vigorous Nature, but I dare &s;ay, is a very &s;ure and judicious One. He &s;eems to enter|tain
<PB N="13" REF="15">
the &s;ame Idea of marrying a Wife, that he would of purcha&s;ing an Hou&s;e or a Farm. I don't mean Venally; but he &s;eems to con&s;ider it as a &s;erious Bargain to be made, which mu&s;t be abided by, and would therefore chu&s;e as thorough an Ac|quaintance with the Nature of his Purcha&s;e as po&s;&s;ible. This is all very right I dare &s;ay, <HI>Charles,</HI> but I cannot be &s;o exceeding methodi|cal upon the Occa&s;ion. I cannot help admitting a little of the vola|tilized Spirit of Love into my Com|po&s;ition; whereas he conducts him|&s;elf with a calm &s;ettled Re&s;olution, never &s;uffering any Flames or Darts to enter his Head on the Occa&s;ion. Not that I con&s;ider my&s;elf as a dying Strephon, with Willows and Billows and Pillows to recline on,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
nor yet as a hot frantic Firebrand full of Jealou&s;y and Madne&s;s, com|mitting Extravagancies one Minute on purpo&s;e to beg Pardon for them the next, nor in &s;hort any way al|tered in the u&s;ual Tenor of my Be|haviour by the Fa&s;cination of Fe|male Attractions. At lea&s;t I hope not, for they &s;ay People in Love are blind to the Ab&s;urdities of their own Conduct. Pray tell me, there|fore, in Friend&s;hip, if you di&s;cover any Thing in my Letters at all &s;avouring of <HI>Bedlam,</HI> or whether you &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult <HI>Monro</HI> or <HI>Battie</HI> upon the Occa&s;ion?</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT would perhaps be needle&s;s to &s;ay any thing about the Heat of the Weather to you, did I not in|tend to employ it as the Excu&s;e for my epi&s;tolary Omi&s;&s;ions. Upon m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Honour it has been too inten&s;e for the&s;e la&s;t ten Days to attempt any thing, particularly &s;o laborious a Bu&s;ine&s;s as that of Letter-writing. My Hours here pa&s;s on very &s;moothly, calm and unruffled, unle&s;s by the occa&s;ional Vocifera|tion of my good Baronet, who is eternally abu&s;ing me, becau&s;e I
<PB N="17" REF="19">
&s;ometimes read Italian, and avow|edly proclaim my Dete&s;tation of the Smell of Hor&s;e-dung. I gue&s;s you have heard how much I am deter|mined upon marrying his Si&s;ter. She is a very good Girl, and I think may contribute to make me more comfortable than I am at pre&s;ent. So I have been laying regular Siege to her Heart and Under&s;tanding ever &s;ince my Arrival, and I believe with con&s;iderable Succe&s;s. Sir <HI>Thorobred</HI> approves of it in his Way as much as I can wi&s;h him; I approve of it highly; our Fortunes are &s;ufficient to authorize the Step; and in &s;hort nothing is wanted but her Con&s;ent ab&s;olute, (for I con&s;ider her tacit as given already,) and her Uncle's Approbation, to conclude our Treaty. What think you, <HI>Charles,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="20">
Shall I do well <Q>Ex nitido fieri Ru&s;ticus?</Q> To change my Red Coat with Lace for an unornamented Brown one, and without becoming Savage or Grazier, to endeavour at getting my Health in a quiet family Way, and rai&s;ing Children for the Defence of my Country in future, in&s;tead of per&s;onally fighting for it at pre&s;ent? I have told you already that my Time pa&s;&s;es very &s;moothly, but I will give you a De&s;cription of my daily Labours, and let you judge for your&s;elf. I generally ri&s;e about Seven, and &s;troll into the Garden with my con&s;tant Companion Lord <HI>Che&s;terfield.</HI> Here we walk for about an Hour, entertaining our&s;elves with each other's Conver&s;ation, and every two or three Turns perhaps &s;topping to take a View of Sir
<PB N="19" REF="21">
<HI>Thorobred,</HI> who is deeply engaged on the other Side of the Hedge in the elegant Occupation of breaking two young Hor&s;es for his Phaeton, and haranguing his Friend <HI>Fetlock,</HI> who attends with a long Whip in his Hand, in all the Mode and Figure of Eque&s;trian Vulgarity. <HI>Entre nous,</HI> this <HI>Fetlock</HI> is &s;ome|times a mo&s;t intolerable Fatigue to me. The Baronet is at lea&s;t a ra|tional Savage, and will &s;ometimes divert and be entertaining even upon the Subject of his own Oddities; but his Chaplain, or Aid du Camp, is in&s;ipid to the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Degree. Sir <HI>Thorobred</HI> often at|tempts to better my Opinion of him, by informing me, what an hone&s;t good-natured Fellow he is, and far be it from me to &s;ay other|wi&s;e.
<PB N="20" REF="22">
It would be cruel to detract from the Merits of a Per&s;on who can &s;o very ill afford it, 'twere like robbing a poor Beggar of his Half-penny. But &s;till 'tis hard one mu&s;t be condemned to &s;uffer his Com|pany. He never commits even a laughable Ab&s;urdity, unle&s;s by mere Accident. The mo&s;t ridiculous Anecdote I ever heard concerning him, and that too by the Contri|vance of Sir <HI>Thorobred,</HI> was his fall|ing a&s;leep at <HI>Foxhall</HI> after a Drink|ing Match on Saturday Afternoon, and continuing in that Situation till the Monday Morning, (I believe it was not above a Week before my Arrival,) when he waked about Eight o'Clock perfectly Sober, dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, breakfa&s;ted, took his Hor&s;e out of the Stable, and de|parted
<PB N="21" REF="23">
very quietly with his Sermon in his Pocket to officiate at his Pari&s;h Church, which is about a Mile di&s;tant. Upon his Arrival there however, not finding any Ap|pearance of a Congregation, he rode twice round the Church-yard, kicked &s;toutly at the Ve&s;try Door, damned his Clerk and Pari&s;hioners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">parately and altogether for a Parcel of negligent Heathens, and returned perfectly &s;atisfied that <HI>he</HI> had at lea&s;t performed <HI>his</HI> Duty, and paid a due Reverence to the Sanctity of the Sabbath.</P>
<P>Well, after Breakfa&s;t, Charles, I attach my&s;elf to Mi&s;s <HI>Rugg;</HI> ride or walk out with her, and Di&s;cour&s;e of my Exploits in <HI>America,</HI>
<Q><PB N="22" REF="24">
<L>Of Battles, Sieges, Fortunes,</L>
<L>Of moving Accidents by Flood and Field,</L>
<L>Of hair-breadth 'Scapes i'th' imminent deadly Breach,</L></Q>

<Q><L>Loves me for the Dangers I have pa&s;t,</L>
<L>And I love her that &s;he does Pity them.</L></Q>
For, in Truth, many of them were very worthy of Pity, and &s;uch as I will not undergo again whil&s;t the Enemy keep on their own Side the Atlantic. Many Times, <HI>Charles,</HI> during our Confinement in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> have I worn the &s;ame Shirt for three Days together; lived invariably upon Rice and Salt Pork, and when at length the Place was evacuated, I was ab&s;olutely reduced to my la&s;t Pint of Lavender Water. Some|times the&s;e Conver&s;ations are bro|ken
<PB N="23" REF="25">
in upon by Sir <HI>Thorobred,</HI> who enquires whether we could turn our Hor&s;es to Gra&s;s there, and how much a Load I &s;uppo&s;ed our Hay might co&s;t Government. Apropos of Sir <HI>Thorobred.</HI> He always wears his Hat in the Hou&s;e, and has be|&s;ides an uncivilized Cu&s;tom of throwing his Legs into the Seat of any Chair that happens to &s;tand near him, if empty; or if occu|pied, he entangles his Boots and Spurs &s;o effectually with the Bars of it, as to expo&s;e the Stockings of his Neighbour to unavoidable De&s;truction, and his Body to im|minent Danger of a Fall. I was &s;itting next to him ye&s;terday Even|ing, when he entertained him&s;elf in this Manner. Pre&s;ently I ro&s;e from my Chair, in which, as I ex|pected,
<PB N="24" REF="26">
his Legs immediately po&s;ted them&s;elves. Sir <HI>Thorobred,</HI> &s;aid I, that Chair I left for your Hat to lie in; and <HI>Apropes de Botes,</HI> ring|ing the Bell, I am now going to give Orders that the gouty Cradle may be brought to &s;upport your Legs, which I &s;hould think a much properer Place for them. He &s;tared for half a Minute in my Face, damn'd me for an odd Fellow, flung his Hat into the Middle of the Room, called for his Slippers, and begging I would lend him my Pocket-gla&s;s, began digging his Jaw-bone with his Hor&s;e-picker as compo&s;edly as if it had been the Hoof of the Animal it appertained to.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear Ea&s;y.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry to write on a Subject which I doubt not will &s;en&s;ibly afflict you. Our poor Friend <HI>Harry</HI> is no more! I received a Letter Ye&s;terday from <HI>Ned Freeman,</HI> who went Abroad with him, informing me of his Decea&s;e. <Q>Wearied of Life (&s;ays he) before he had well entered into it; with a Temper &s;oured by Reflexion, and a Con&s;ti|tution ruined by Exce&s;s, he died unknown and unregarded at <HI>Li&s;bon</HI> in the twenty-&s;econd Year of his Age. Except My&s;elf and his
<PB N="27" REF="29">
Servant there was not a Soul in the Place that he could &s;peak to. We were with him in his la&s;t Moments, and, I declare to you that it was with the utmo&s;t diffi|culty I &s;upported my&s;elf through the Scene. There is at all Times &s;omething inconceivably Awful in that la&s;t Agony of convul&s;ed Nature. But in the pre&s;ent In|&s;tance it was particularly &s;o. To &s;ee him Pale and Emaciated, fall|ing in the Prime of Youth, a Sacrifice to his own Imprudence. To &s;ee every Feature di&s;torted, every Nerve &s;triving with its Di&s;&s;olution, and Nature by her &s;trong repeated Struggles, loud|ly exclaiming that her Time was not yet come; is a Spectacle too affecting to be looked upon with
<PB N="28" REF="30">
Compo&s;ure. It was near three Hours before he breathed his la&s;t, with his Eyes fixed &s;tedfa&s;tly on me, and his Hands firmly gra&s;p|ing one of mine. Before you receive this, I &s;hall probably be on my Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>England,</HI> with our poor Friend's Body.</Q></P>
<P>Surely, <HI>Ea&s;y,</HI> this is a Mela|choly Hi&s;tory! The Inattention of his Guardians, and the certain Pro&s;pect of an immen&s;e Fortune immediately upon his coming of Age, were the Cau&s;e of his Mi&s;|fortunes. Happy had it been for him, if his Father had lived a few Years longer! It is amazing too how greatly his Manner of Life had altered his Di&s;po&s;ition. He had latterly lo&s;t all that Mirth, that Ea&s;e and Gaiety of Heart which
<PB N="29" REF="31">

<P>YOUR melancholy Account of our Friend's Decea&s;e gives me much Concern. Poor <HI>Harry,</HI> I am &s;incerely &s;orry for him!

<P>WELL my cunning re&s;erved little Madam, I have heard of all your Coquetries to en&s;nare the poor <HI>Melmoth,</HI> though you have not thought fit to write to me &s;ince his Arrival among&s;t you. Indeed, I think you might have found &s;ome &s;pare half Hour to &s;cribble in, and acquaint me a little how Matters went on; e&s;pecially, as you had declared your Intentions with &s;uch a pretty blu&s;hing Ba&s;hfulne&s;s in your la&s;t Letter. Upon my Honour, you de&s;erve to be plagued a little. <Q>Should nothing Material prevent, I &s;hall probably &s;pend great Part
<PB N="40" REF="42">
of the Summer with my Brother, as he &s;eems to wi&s;h much for my Company.</Q></P>
<P>How very pretty and &s;i&s;terlike that was of you, wasn't it? But then, <Q><HI>We</HI> are not without Hopes of &s;eeing Captain <HI>Melmoth.</HI></Q> How that comes &s;tealing in, as if it thought to e&s;cape unob&s;erved. And pre&s;ently it is, <Q>Somehow or other, <HI>I</HI> wi&s;h he may come down to us.</Q> How we have changed by Degrees, from the Plural to the Singular! And then in the next Sentence, <Q>He is &s;uch an agree|able Man, and &s;o ready to do as I plea&s;e with.</Q></P>
<P>O you little Gip&s;ey! They may talk as they plea&s;e, but I'll be hanged if one &s;uch little Puritan as your&s;elf won't co&s;t a Lover more
<PB N="41" REF="43">
Pains and Attendance, and give him more Plague, aye, and play him more Tricks too, than half a Dozen of us mad-headed ones. And then to put your&s;elf to the Trouble of telling a naughty Story and denying it, and afterwards running into the love-&s;ick Strain &s;o artfully, as if you had forgot that you were writ|ing about your Brother.</P>
<P>Indeed I mu&s;t in Charity believe, that you did it all on Purpo&s;e, or I &s;hall never have any Mercy on you. But you &s;hould really have written to me. For my Part, I have nothing but Scribbling to amu&s;e me at pre&s;ent. <HI>Ea&s;y</HI> (as you may gue&s;s by the Time of his leaving <HI>Foxhall,</HI>) came here but <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> and this Morning he was packed up in a Po&s;t-chai&s;e with my Father,

and tran&s;ported to <HI>Oxford</HI> in pur|&s;uit of my Spou&s;e and Tutor elect. Poor Fellow, I dare &s;ay he could have found a Better, without the Expence of Travelling in &s;earch of him. However, he is gone, and his poor di&s;con&s;olate <HI>Kitty</HI> has no other Bu&s;ine&s;s but to <Q>Wake and Weep,</Q> and read Novels by Lamplight all Night, and to write Letters and accompany de&s;pairing Ditties with her Piano Forte all Day. However, I made him &s;wear eternal Fidelity, and &s;o forth, in the true Stile of Chivalry, before his Departure to that Country of Ne|cromancers and Inchanters, whom he promi&s;es to de&s;troy and &s;pare not, unle&s;s they acknowledge the incomparable Prince&s;s he wor&s;hips, to be the very Flower and Paragon

<P>I fancy he will find this Ta&s;k ra|ther difficult, for by the Specimen I have &s;een, I believe the odd Things would rather forfeit all Preten&s;ions to Chivalry and every Thing el&s;e, than endure the Terror of pa&s;&s;ing five Minutes in a Woman's Com|pany, in which Time at farthe&s;t they mu&s;t have emptied their whole Budget of Conver&s;ation.

to return with them, by any Argu|ments what&s;oever. If he &s;hould not, my Father's Plan of Operations for the pre&s;ent at lea&s;t, will be en|tirely deranged, and before he can form any new Ones, <HI>Ea&s;y</HI> is to chop Logic, quote Greek, bring him into a good Humour after Dinner, and then, having recounted his numer|ous Services and unparallel'd Di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s, a&s;k my Hand of him in Form. If on the Contrary, the Pedantic Animal's Avarice, or &s;ome other &s;trange Infatuation, &s;hould prompt him to hazard a long Vaca|tion in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire;</HI> why, he will be a delightful Subject to exerci&s;e one's ill Humours upon, and after having &s;tayed there 'till every Idea has been ridiculed out of him, he may return Home to be the laugh|ing

<P>Oh, I mu&s;t tell you now tho' whil&s;t I think of it, what a Sacri|fice <HI>Ea&s;y</HI> has made at my Shrine, and what Incen&s;e he has been offer|ing to that dear favourite Foible of ours, Vanity.

<P>As <HI>Delia</HI>'s Papa and Mama lived entirely in the Country, the young People had not met &s;ince they were Children, and <HI>Colin</HI>'s Parents, (for &s;o he calls him&s;elf) having no very good Opinion of Mi&s;s <HI>Delia,</HI> had often de&s;cribed her to him in a Manner not the mo&s;t favourable. One Summer, however, they re|&s;olved to pay old Mr. <HI>Delia</HI> a Month's or &s;ix Weeks Vi&s;it; and it

being Vacation Time with young Mr. <HI>Colin,</HI> who was then of the Univer&s;ity, he of cour&s;e accom|panied them. And then it was, that the &s;uperlative Excellence and Goodne&s;s of Mi&s;s <HI>Delia</HI> &s;truck him through the Liver! Poor Man, he was in a &s;ad Way about it: for Mi&s;s Delia, tho' &s;he treated him very kindly, was unluckily engaged already to a Man of very con&s;ider|able Fortune; and when, after &s;ome Time, he attempted to prefer his Suit, &s;he revealed to him the State of the Ca&s;e, and &s;hewed him one or two Letters from her other Lover, Mr. <HI>Corydon,</HI> which entirely drove poor <HI>Colin</HI> to De&s;peration. Then, it fortunately happened, that in&s;tead of hanging or drowning him&s;elf, as a downright ignorant

<SALUTE>My dear Sir Anthony,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;o overjoy'd! I am the happie&s;t Man alive! All my Schemes have &s;ucceeded, and I have been down to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and have brought up Mr. <HI>Pedant</HI> with me, and we are as happy and as learned as the Day is long, and we are all going down to <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI> in a Day or two. And now, my old Friend, &s;ince every thing has turned out &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly, I will let you into the Secret which I talked of in my former Letters, and inform you who
<PB N="62" REF="64">
has been my Confidant and A&s;&s;i&s;t|ant in managing this Bu&s;ine&s;s. I &s;ay, &s;ince every thing has turned out &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly: for el&s;e you know as well as I can tell you, that, "Lea&s;t &s;aid is &s;oone&s;t mended," and, <Q>Bad News always comes fa&s;t enough.</Q> and the like. His Name is <HI>William Ea&s;y,</HI> a young Man about &s;even or eight and twenty. His Father and I were old School|fellows and Cronies at <HI>Hackney</HI> to|gether. Poor old <HI>Ea&s;y,</HI> he u&s;ed to be &s;adly troubled with the Gout latterly like my&s;elf, and went to <HI>Bath</HI> once or twice in a Year, con|&s;tantly. And would you believe it, the young Fellow, his Son, found me out when I was there la&s;t, before I vi&s;ited <HI>Staples</HI> you know; aye and came to Breakfa&s;t with me too,
<PB N="63" REF="65">
and was as glad to &s;ee me, the young Rogue was, as if I had been of his own Age. Let them &s;ay what they will of the Vices and Follies of the pre&s;ent Race of young Men, I am glad to find they are not all &s;o corrupt. And he is clever too in the Bargain, and has read a good Deal, and has &s;een a good Deal of the World too, I dare &s;ay, which is no harm, when it does not interfere with a Man's Learn|ing. Now what Per&s;on do you think could be &s;o proper to a&s;&s;i&s;t in managing this Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Hu&s;|band for <HI>Kitty,</HI> as he was. For his Manner of Introducing him&s;elf at fir&s;t to me, &s;hewed how di&s;inte|re&s;ted he was, and that he came to &s;ee me purely becau&s;e I was &s;o well acquainted with his poor old Father,
<PB N="64" REF="66">
and what a Regard he had for me upon that Account. So I com|municated all my Intentions to him, and he approved of them highly, and accompanied me in my Journey to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and talked to me about the <HI>Prometheus</HI> of <HI>Ae&s;chylus</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Treati&s;e upon Rhetoric, by the Hour together as we went along. And I have engaged him to come down with me to <HI>Dor&s;et|&s;hire,</HI> to compleat the Affair. So Mr. <HI>Pedant</HI> and my&s;elf, (I wanted to have per&s;uaded Mr. <HI>Pedant</HI> to have gone down in the &s;ame Car|riage with my Daughter, by way of making a Beginning you know, but he cho&s;e rather to go with me.) So Mr. <HI>Pedant</HI> and my&s;elf will travel in my Chariot and four, and I mu&s;t make an Apology to <HI>Ea&s;y</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="67">
about going in an hired Chai&s;e with my Daughter, and they can keep on before, and prepare Things at the Inns for us. Do write to me &s;oon, and tell me what your Opi|nion is of all this, and believe me to be,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT I have for this Week pa&s;t intended epi&s;tolizing <HI>Melmoth Place,</HI> is as certain as that I have omitted doing it, and you perhaps would now have been as well &s;atisfied, with good-naturedly taking the Will for the Deed, and compounding for my not writing at all. However, &s;ince the Pen is put to Paper, you &s;hall have no Rea&s;on to complain of my Brevity in Corre&s;pondence, be your Pa&s;&s;ion for Letter-reading ever &s;o exce&s;&s;ive. It is now about three Weeks &s;ince
<PB N="67" REF="69">
I made my E&s;cape from <HI>Oxford,</HI> from whence, in Conjunction with old <HI>Hartley,</HI> I have effected the Pe|regrination of <HI>Pedant</HI> to this we&s;tern World: A Piece of Succe&s;s as far beyond my Expectation as my Wi&s;hes. Indeed, I had not the &s;malle&s;t Idea that any thing could have induced him to &s;uch a de&s;pe|rate Undertaking, and &s;hould have been full as well plea&s;ed, had he been inexorable to our Intreaties; for by the frequent Con&s;ultations he has held with the old Gentle|man for the&s;e la&s;t three or four Days, and &s;ome other little Inci|dents, I &s;u&s;pect there is more in the Wind than I am aware of. How|ever, as I don't feel my&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to &s;tand greatly in Awe of their In|tentions, whatever they may be, I
<PB N="68" REF="70">
&s;hall drop him for the pre&s;ent, and commence the Journal, or Hi&s;tory of our Univer&s;ity Expedition.</P>
<P>About the Middle of <HI>July</HI> then, within two Days after my Return from <HI>Foxhall</HI> to <HI>Hill-Street,</HI> I was put on board a Po&s;t-chai&s;e with old <HI>Hartley</HI> about eight o'Clock in the Morning, and about Four in the Afternoon found my&s;elf, with my Companion, at the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> Inn, <HI>Oxford.</HI> As it happened to be during the Time of the Public Act, the Town was to|lerably crouded. So having depo&s;ited our Baggage in the be&s;t Room we could meet with, we procured pro|per Directions to Mr. <HI>Pedant</HI>'s Chambers, and immediately &s;allied out in Pur&s;uit of them. Many and curious were the Figures we en|countered
<PB N="69" REF="71">
in our Way, and of all Sizes and Dimen&s;ions. Several of them I remember'd as my Contem|poraries, with whom, in tho&s;e Days, I had been very well acquainted. But the Devil, or my evil Genius, or &s;ome &s;trange Circum&s;tance that I was not apprized of, had &s;o tran&s;|formed and disfigured me &s;ince that Time, that not a Man of them could I prevail upon to remain within Gun-&s;hot of me. If I ran, hollow'd, or called them by their Names, it &s;erved but to increa&s;e their Velocity in Retreating. They &s;cudded up their Stair-ca&s;es like black Rabbits in a Warren; and I believe it was near ten Minutes before I could procure any Crea|ture to a&s;&s;i&s;t me with farther In|&s;tructions towards the Di&s;covery of
<PB N="70" REF="72">
<HI>Pedant</HI>'s Re&s;idence. At la&s;t, I had the good Fortune to meet <HI>Tom Frankley,</HI> your Neighbour <HI>Har|borough</HI>'s Nephew, who is a Gen|tleman Commoner of the &s;ame College. He conducted us imme|diately to the Object of our Pur|&s;uit, and begg'd, if I was not already engaged, I would call in the Evening and &s;up with him, and bring old <HI>Hartley</HI> with me. I told him that I feared Supper would not be in my Power, but that I would certainly call upon him about Eight o'Clock, though I could not pro|mi&s;e farther, So we parted, and Mr. <HI>Hartley</HI> and my&s;elf proceeded up the Stair-ca&s;e towards the Door of <HI>Pedant</HI>'s Apartment. Unluckily it happened, that not thinking of the &s;till Caution nece&s;&s;ary in an
<PB N="71" REF="73">
Attack of this Sort, we advanced carele&s;sly, talking as our Van-guard approached the Outworks, and thereby effectually excluded our|&s;elves from all po&s;&s;ibility of enter|ing. For ju&s;t as we turned round the la&s;t Landing-place, the Vigi|lance of the Enemy was alarmed, the outer Door &s;hut with a thun|der Clap, and all within was &s;ilent. You may imagine that after this, all the Knocking and Noi&s;e we could make, would be of very little Service; &s;o we were obliged to content our&s;elves for the pre&s;ent with the Suppo&s;ition that he pro|bably was bu&s;ied, as old <HI>Hartley</HI> &s;aid, in &s;ome metaphy&s;ical Inve&s;ti|gation; but that he would go there by him&s;elf in the Evening, and attempt him a &s;econd Time by
<PB N="72" REF="74">
Surprize. This Plan of Proceed|ing I entirely applauded, as it re|lea&s;ed me from all the purgatorial Di&s;cipline of &s;uch a Service, and gave me the better Opportunity of Supping with <HI>Frankley,</HI> who&s;e Con|ver&s;ation, tho' le&s;s ab&s;tru&s;e, would probably be more entertaining. So having drank our Tea together quietly at the Coffee-hou&s;e, I left my Companion planning the Mode of his Attack over a New&s;paper, and went immediately to fulfil my Engagement. And mo&s;t excellently entertained I was, both with the Behaviour and Conver&s;ation of my Company. So much &s;o, that with|out any Apology, I &s;hall &s;end you a minute Detail of the whole Bu|&s;ine&s;s, which, if you find your&s;elf too &s;tupid or lazy to read with due
<PB N="73" REF="75">
Attention, I de&s;ire you will forth|with &s;end back to me again, with all proper Thanks and Acknow|ledgements, Carriage paid.</P>
<P>Well, to <HI>Frankley</HI>'s I went then, &s;at down, and having got thro' the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Bu&s;ine&s;s of Speechify|ing and Enquiries, was ju&s;t verging towards a Di&s;cour&s;e upon Univer&s;ity Matters in general; when, on a &s;udden, (preceded however by an infinite Variety of Tallios, Hoicks's, hark to Venoms, Vipers, Vixens, Vermins, which we perceived gra|dually increa&s;ing from the oppo&s;ite Side of the Quadrangle,) the Door flew open, and in ru&s;hed a Party of Gentlemen, who, it &s;eems, from their particular Attachment to that Species of Cur, as well as from the exact Similarity of their Noi&s;es,
<PB N="74" REF="76">
are called the Terriers. At the Head of this extraordinary Troop was a Mr. <HI>Jack Soleci&s;m,</HI> who fir&s;t di&s;cover'd his Capability of Arti|culation by a "Damn that villain|ous Ra&s;cal <HI>Euclid</HI> to * * * * *, I wi&s;h the Fellow * * * * * * * *, and whatever el&s;e is u&s;ual on &s;uch Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>This curious Exclamation, which having la&s;ted for &s;ome Minutes, terminated but with the Breath of the Utterer, was accompa|nied by a loud Amen in Cho|rus from the Re&s;t of the Com|pany. Pre&s;ently &s;everal of them &s;natched Chairs, and threw them|&s;elves into them for the Benefit of Conver&s;ation. Well <HI>Frankley,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Soleci&s;m</HI> to my Friend, after all, this College is a damn'd Place.
<PB N="75" REF="77">
Here am I now, a Fellow allowedly clever, prepo&s;terou&s;ly &s;o; now and then a little Drunk to be &s;ure: why they puzzle and torture me at their Examinations wor&s;e than a rich Criminal in an Inqui&s;ition. Strike me &s;ober, if I know whether their Examinations are mo&s;t like an In|qui&s;ition or a Bullbait. And the Ra&s;cals are true bred Dogs too, every one of them; they run all at the Head; 'till a Man's Brain be|comes as confu&s;ed as a Bankrupt's Account Books. However, I keep my Head up, and then they can't pin me. <Q>An old Lord of the Council rated me the other Day in the Street, but I marked him not, and yet he talked very wi&s;ely, and in the Street too.</Q> But I regarded him not. I am unhurt in
<PB N="76" REF="78">
the mid&s;t of them, like <HI>Daniel</HI> in the Den of Lions. Aye, or in the fiery Furnace, cried another, at the &s;ame In&s;tant catching his Chair from under him with a Velo|city that tilted him Head-foremo&s;t into the Grate. O damn the Ex|pence of a fiery Furnace, cried a Third, Expence is nothing, Trou|ble's all, bellowed a Fourth. Back him up, fan him, &s;pilt, di&s;h'd, all abroad, wound up, &s;ha'n't be bad, not of the two, a few or &s;o, all abroad, abroad, abro&mdash;ad. Here Articulation ended, and was &s;ucceeded by their former Canine Conver&s;ation, with which they quitted, or, to u&s;e their own Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, <HI>dangled out of</HI> the Room.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were gone, <HI>Frankley</HI> began entering into &s;ome
<PB N="77" REF="79">
Sort of Di&s;&s;ertation on the Cha|racters of the&s;e Incomprehen&s;ibles; explained to me their Stile of Life, their Amu&s;ements, the Rules of their Club, with many other Arti|cles infinitely curious and enter|taining. <HI>Jack Soleci&s;m,</HI> &s;ays he, is a Fellow of very excellent Abi|lities, but very rarely &s;ober enough to employ them properly; or to adopt his own Words, is <Q>Allow|edly Clever, prepo&s;terou&s;ly &s;o,</Q> but, <Q>Now and then a little Drunk to be &s;ure.</Q> He is not at pre&s;ent a Member of the Terrier Society, but has a very fair Pro&s;pect of being &s;peedily admitted, as he ex|cels particularly in the Indian War Whoop, and is allowed by &s;everal Sea-Captains who are good Judges, to approach nearer the true Sound
<PB N="78" REF="80">
than any European they had ever conver&s;ed with.</P>
<P>I hope, continued he, that you find your&s;elf plea&s;ed with the Com|pany of the&s;e good Folks, as the greater Part infallibly de&s;ign doing them&s;elves the Honour of Supping with me, and it is an ab&s;olute Impo&s;|&s;ibility to put them off, or prevent them.

Part, by retiring in Ca&s;e of parti|cular and extraordinary, Combu&s;|tion, to which Article I with equal readine&s;s a&s;&s;ented. So Matters be|ing &s;tipulated between us, we &s;tretched our&s;elves upon a Sopha, and with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Sleep and Chit-Chat, murdered our Interval of Time very hand&s;omely; and by and by, after having enjoyed I be|lieve about an Hour's re&s;pite, our Friends the Terriers returned, with <HI>Jack Soleci&s;m</HI> the fir&s;t Fiddle as u&s;ual. As he was &s;till very tolera|bly drunk, and the Fumes of the Liquor remained in ab&s;olute Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of his Capital, we had hardly eaten three Mouthfulls, (I forgot to tell you we were at Supper) when he was upon his Legs, declaiming with all the Energy of Diction, and

before we had well fini&s;hed our Meal, entered with an Oration &s;o gloriou&s;ly ab&s;urd and ridiculous, that I could not help committing it to Paper as &s;oon as I quitted them, and now &s;end it to you with ab&s;o|lute Injunctions to be diverted, as you value my Friend&s;hip, or regard the Trouble I &s;hall be &s;ubjected to, both in tran&s;cribing that and relat|ing the Con&s;equences which at|tended it.</P>

with the Fender, the Marks where|of my Forehead retains with a grateful Sen&s;e of their Utility unto this Hour: I think, I &s;ay, I was then giving it as my Opinion that this College was a damn'd Place, that is in other Words, for I mean not to &s;wear ab&s;olutely, a Place to be condemned utterly; and now my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e is to make good my A&s;&s;ertions by a little incontro|vertible Ratiocination.</P>

Peace be to all &s;uch Men! To their great Grizzle Wigs and Apathy I bow with Reverence. The Honorable Gentlemen may call them &s;tupid. I adore them for their Stupidity! 'Tis perhaps a plea&s;ant, it is certainly an innocent Amu&s;ement, It offends nobody. Were they as &s;tupid as many of them are corpulent, which I allow cannot ea&s;ily be the Ca&s;e; as &s;tupid as a Sot before Dinner, or an Al|derman after it; I pay them the

greater Reverence therefore. But perhaps the Honorable Gentlemen may object to their Corpulence? To their globo&s;e Rotundity of Paunch? I would a&s;k the Honor|able Gentlemen, whether they are the Contractors for Victualling it? Do they provide Covering for its Convexity? Is not the Owner at the &s;ole Expence of continuing it in its u&s;ual State of Dilation? Is not he at the &s;ole Expence of cover|ing its Nakedne&s;s, which unle&s;s covered would doubtle&s;s be un&s;eem|ly, with an extravagant Profu&s;ion of Broad-cloth? Is not that Broad-cloth black too? A Colour, (if indeed Black may be con&s;idered as a Colour, which however my Philo&s;o|phy has not yet determined upon,) notoriou&s;ly Expen&s;ive from the Rot|tenne&s;s

At lea&s;t was it not Black originally, tho' now per|haps its Tint may be more venera|bly a&s;&s;imilated to the verd antique Marble of <HI>Italy.</HI> But enough of the&s;e, Gentlemen; let us now turn our Attention to my &s;econd Species of Exi&s;tences: To a Set of Men originally endued with Abilities, with Abilities de&s;troyed and obnu|bilated by Re&s;idence and Applica|tion. Does any one &s;tart at my A&s;&s;ertion? The Honorable Gen|tlemen are not to be taught I hope, that Application is the Bane and De&s;truction of Abilities. The hu|man Mind, Gentlemen, pardon the Compari&s;on, is like a Leg of Mut|ton. The Meat is fine, but re|quires Roa&s;ting to make it eatable. We place it before the Fire then,

We re&s;ume it: and upon cutting it, we find the natural Gravy remains there, but matured and meliorated by Con|coction. So far it has been in a State of Improvement. It is then at its Point Tropical, its Sol&s;tice, its Zenith of Perfection. But would any Cook in Chri&s;tendom replace it there in Expectation of farther Advantages? Would &s;he not know that any farther Torrefaction mu&s;t be prejudicial? That the natural Gravy would from that Time de|crea&s;e and evaporate gradually?

I began to &s;u&s;pect that he was determined to make the be&s;t of him&s;elf, and &s;o brought the other Animal by way of Foil. For though neither of them could be accu&s;ed of being overburthen'd with <HI>Entregent</HI> or Politene&s;s, yet the Re&s;erve and Aukwardne&s;s which proceeded from <HI>Mauvai&s;e Honte</HI> in <HI>Pedant,</HI> &s;eemed in the other to ari&s;e from a churli&s;h Self-conceit, and a predetermined Contempt for the Under&s;tanding of his Company. Good God, thought I, this mu&s;t be poor <HI>Soleci&s;m</HI>'s Friend <HI>Euclid;</HI> there cannot &s;urely exi&s;t two &s;uch Wretches!

<P>I Received yours. Upon my Honour you have treated my la&s;t Letter very unmercifully; and po|&s;itively accu&s;ed me of Slyne&s;s and Secre&s;y, without con&s;idering the Confidence I placed in you by &s;ending it at all. Suppo&s;e I had thought proper to burn it, and had given you a fair Copy, revi&s;ed and corrected? And then, after hav|ing been as &s;piteful and malicious as you po&s;&s;ibly could be, and torn the poor thing Peice-meal, Sen|tence by Sentence, you affect to
<PB N="112" REF="114">
be wondrou&s;ly merciful, and 'tis your Charity for&s;ooth that obliges you to believe that I did it all on Purpo&s;e. Since you are &s;o very ready at Belief and Suppo&s;ition, I &s;hall not tell you whether I did or not, perhaps I might. But you know I can't retort or rally you, which makes you &s;o &s;aucy. How|ever <HI>I mu&s;t in Charity believe that you did it all</HI> by Accident, <HI>or I &s;hall never have any Mercy on you;</HI> and as you have made &s;ome amends by &s;ending me <HI>Ea&s;y</HI>'s Poetical Secrets, I will even go farther, and give you a little authentic Information as to my Pro&s;pects with <HI>Melmoth.</HI> And this I can do in a very few Sentences, merely by way of Con|tinuation to <HI>Ea&s;y</HI>'s Intelligence. Since his Departure from <HI>Foxhall</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="115">
then, my Uncle has been applied to by Letter, in con&s;equence of which he arrived here about three Days ago. He has given his Con|&s;ent and Approbation to our Mar|riage; <HI>Melmoth</HI> has determined to quit the Army, and every thing will probably be concluded in the Cour&s;e of this Month. We expect my two Aunts from <HI>York</HI> on <HI>Wed|ne&s;day.</HI> Is this Account plain and undi&s;gui&s;ed enough? Or is there any &s;ly Stile of Secre&s;y to be com|plained of? As to expatiating upon my own Happine&s;s and my Inamo|rato's Extacy, I &s;hall leave your Sen&s;ations when you think of &s;imi|lar Pro&s;pects with <HI>Ea&s;y,</HI> to &s;upply the Omi&s;&s;ion.

And truly I began latterly to &s;u&s;pect as much my&s;elf; but then who would have thought of her going off and running away in this &s;udden Manner as one may call it? or el&s;e I had prepared to counteract that Hu&s;band for her.

<P><PB N="117" REF="119">Here I went to her after Breakfa&s;t this Morning, and told her that next <HI>Monday</HI> was to be the happy Day, and how happy I &s;hould be, and the like; and &s;he put me into a Pa&s;&s;ion, and when I came to en|quire for her at Dinner Time, no|body could tell what was become of her, and <HI>Ea&s;y</HI> was mi&s;&s;ing like|wi&s;e. So I was for going to the Inn, and making Enquiries, and following them immediately in the Heat of my Pa&s;&s;ion, but Mr. <HI>Pedant</HI> was luckily at Hand to prevent me, and per&s;uaded me that by &s;taying till the next Morning, we could &s;end and inve&s;tigate Matters at the Inn more minutely, and &s;hould have more Time to con&s;ider what Steps &s;hould be taken, and to pack up our Things, and to prepare

every thing for pur&s;uing them.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Rugg,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW &s;hall I write to you, and what Kind of round|about Expre&s;&s;ion &s;hall I adopt to acquaint you with my Situation! The more I con&s;ider the more I feel my&s;elf at a Lo&s;s! In three Words then, be it known &mdash; that my Fa|ther has been opinionated and im|perious; I have been perhaps a little incon&s;iderate; and am at pre|&s;ent, almo&s;t before I know how to believe it, on the Road to <HI>Scotland</HI> with <HI>Ea&s;y.</HI></P>
<P>And now, if you have had Time enough for your Wonderment and
<PB N="121" REF="123">
Conjecture, I'll let you into Parti|culars. You know my poor Papa, among&s;t his other Qualifications, had always that wi&s;e one of mak|ing every thing a great Secret, and keeping People as much in the Dark as po&s;&s;ible whenever he had a Scheme in his Head, by way of &s;urprizing them all at once with its Excellence, when the Wind did get to it. So la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> after Breakfa&s;t he came up to my Room, (a Thing not very common with him, and which indeed he &s;eldom u&s;ed but upon grand Occa&s;ions,) and &s;eating him&s;elf in a great Chair, and &s;ettling his Wig with both Hands by way of Preparation, <HI>"Kitty,"</HI> &s;ays he, with a Face that told me &s;ome wondrous Matter was in Agitation, <Q>you remember
<PB N="122" REF="124">
when I was in <HI>London,</HI> that I in|troduced my Friend Mr. <HI>Pedant</HI> to you as a Man every Way qua|lified to make you a good Hu&s;|band, and to re&s;train that Levity and Giddine&s;s which the younger Part of your Sex are too much guilty of; though I mu&s;t own I rather de&s;paired of ever bringing him to con&s;ent to the Match. He has now you know, been here above a Month with me in the Country; in which Time by Per&s;ua&s;ions and Promi&s;es, I have at la&s;t with Difficulty prevailed upon him to accept of my Pro|po&s;als: and therefore, le&s;t upon Recon&s;ideration he &s;hould be in|duced to alter his Mind towards you in this Matter, I have thought it better to Strike whil&s;t the
<PB N="123" REF="125">
Iron is hot, and on <HI>Monday</HI> next have re&s;olved that you &s;hall be made happy. In Regard to</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>My Dear <HI>Rugg</HI> I was Thunder|&s;truck! for tho' I knew this was my Father's Intention in bringing <HI>Pedant</HI> to <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI> with him, yet I had no Idea that the ungain Animal would ever have con&s;ented to &s;o dreadful a Ceremony with me, after the many &s;illy Looks I had helped him to put on, &s;ince he had been there. However, I pre&s;ently collected my&s;elf enough to cut my Father &s;hort in the Middle of his Sentence, which I &s;uppo&s;e was to have concluded with a Panegyric on his Bookworm, by a <Q>God forbid, my Dear Sir, that ever the Living and the Dead &s;hould be joined together! Let the Dead
<PB N="124" REF="126">
bury their Dead, my Dear Father, and his Books him, &s;ay I; for I'm &s;ure he is as di&s;agreeable and dead to the World as the Lan|guages he cultivates.</Q></P>
<P>My Father looked at me, wond|rous petulant I could perceive. O tho&s;e confounded Languages! that ever my ill Stars led me to men|tion the Word! for immediately, and the Frenzy took him like Lightning, "Peace, Peace, Girl," &s;aid he, <Q>the Greek Language though it,</Q>&mdash; And here he was tumbling all at once into his Eulo|gium upon its various Excellencies, when I, who had experienced the mi&s;erable <HI>Ennui</HI> of that &s;elf &s;ame Di&s;&s;ertation at lea&s;t fifty Times in my Life, and knew from the Be|ginning that it might la&s;t from two
<PB N="125" REF="127">
Hours to three or four; could not help interrupting him, by &s;aying how much I was indebted for the Trouble he was going to give him|&s;elf, but as I had it perfectly fre&s;h in my Memory &s;ince the Rehear&s;al of <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Se'nnight, I &s;hould be happy to po&s;tpone the Hearing till &s;ome future Opportunity, when my Recollection might begin to fail me. This put him into a de&s;perate Pa&s;&s;ion, which I really did not De&s;ign. He &s;natch'd up his Stick to expre&s;s the Vehemence of his Di&s;plea&s;ure; but Impatience begetting Inatten|tion, in&s;tead of the Floor which he intended &s;hould be the Sufferer, he applied it to his own Gouty Shins with &s;uch a hearty Good-will, that I thought he would never have forgiven him&s;elf. He was now
<PB N="126" REF="128">
pa&s;t all Patience: &s;o that grinning between his high Anger for my contemptuous Treatment of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and the actual Pain he &s;uffered from the Vigour of his own Ba&s;tinado; "By God," cried he, <Q><HI>Kitty,</HI> I'll not be trifled with. <HI>Monday</HI> is the Day on which your Happine&s;s is determined, and Happy you &s;hall be, (rubbing his Leg all the Time,) in &s;pite of your&s;elf. I know more of <HI>Ea&s;y,</HI> Madam, than you are aware of.</Q> And with the&s;e Words he hobbled out of the Room.</P>
<P>What could I do, my Dear? I knew him to be exceeding ob&s;tinate, particularly when Literature was in the Que&s;tion; be&s;ides I was ra|ther piqued at the Po&s;itivene&s;s and
<PB N="127" REF="129">
Undutifulne&s;s of his Behaviour; for I hold Undutifulne&s;s in a Pa|rent to be the wor&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible Offences. And then too his la&s;t ob&s;cure Sentence in regard to <HI>Ea&s;y,</HI> greatly perplexed me. Ju&s;t as I was in the Mid&s;t of all the&s;e Puzzles, <HI>Ea&s;y</HI> came into the Room; and di&s;covering immediately by my Countenance that all was not Right, enquired what was the Matter. I, as People in a Pa&s;&s;ion, like Inva|lids, are always bur&s;ting to tell their Complaints, related all that had happened; and to cut my Story &s;hort, what with Per&s;ua&s;ion and Argument on one Side, and Fear and Di&s;plea&s;ure and an odd Ta&s;te for Novelty and Eclat on the other, recollecting too that very ju&s;t Saying of the Poet, that <Q>The
<PB N="128" REF="130">
Woman who deliberates is lo&s;t,</Q> which <HI>Ea&s;y</HI> very forcibly urged upon me: he made the be&s;t of his Opportunity, and within two Hours I found my&s;elf in a Po&s;t-chai&s;e, half willing, half unwilling, no|thing with me but my Riding-Habit and &s;ome Linen, and indeed not quite certain whether I was there my&s;elf.</P>
<P>So you &s;ee my Dear, how great Con&s;equences, like great Folks, generally owe their Greatne&s;s to &s;mall Cau&s;es and little Incidents&punc; for had not that unfortunate Di&s;&s;er|tation upon the Grecians come acro&s;s us, and had not my Father, when he catched up his Stick in con&s;equence of my thwarting him there, made that unpropitious Ap|plication to his own Shins, in&s;tead
<PB N="129" REF="131">
of the Ground which he intended, we might probably have talked the Matter over coolly; the Day of Marriage might have been po&s;t|poned; <HI>Pedant,</HI> after &s;everal Pro|tractions, might in the End have been exploded or tired out; and every Thing terminated as I could have wi&s;hed for. Whereas now, my Father I dare &s;ay is raving like fifty Bedlamites, and perhaps &s;pout|ing Greek too at &s;uch a Rate that all the Country will take him for a Necromancer; whil&s;t I, like a poor incon&s;iderate giddy-brain'd Girl, am flouri&s;hing away, and killing Po&s;t-hor&s;es with a Knight Errant on a Journey to the Land of Matri|mony, without &s;o much as a new Gown or a Wedding-ring prepared for the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="132">Well, my Dear <HI>Maria!</HI> of all the &s;illy Things you feel your&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to, never make a Runaway Match of it.

you &s;ome Information as to the grand Outline of our Proceedings; the Particulars I am now going to furni&s;h you with.</P>
<P>I believe I mentioned in my la&s;t that I was not entirely &s;atisfied with &s;ome Parts of <HI>Pedant</HI>'s Behaviour, nor with the frequent Clo&s;etings and Conferences between him and old <HI>Hartley.</HI> I cannot &s;ay that I paid any Attention to tho&s;e Appearances at the Time, but &s;ince they have turned out &s;o con&s;equential, I mu&s;t men|tion one particular Circum&s;tance as it occurs to me, before I proceed any farther. About a Fortnight ago I remember, when old <HI>Hartley</HI> had retired as u&s;ual to take his Afternoon Nap, and <HI>Pedant</HI> and my&s;elf were left in the Parlour to|gether, I &s;tept out of the Room
<PB N="134" REF="136">
for about ten Minutes, to relieve my&s;elf from the Fatigue of his Taciturnity by a little Conver&s;ation with my <HI>Kitty</HI> above Stairs. Upon my Return, finding the Wretch exactly where I left him, ab&s;orpt in Cogitation; I was in &s;ome doubt at fir&s;t whether I ought not to at|tempt a Recovery from the Torpor he &s;eemed to labour under, by a &s;alutary Tweak of the No&s;e; when pre&s;ently I ob&s;erved the Fore-finger of his Right-hand placed cautiou&s;ly and as if it was an Act of Delibe|ration, acro&s;s the Palm of his Left, and after a few unintelligible Mut|terings, he began Syllogizing as follows.</P>
<Q><L>The Man who marries Mi&s;s <HI>Hartley,</HI> gets her Fortune.</L>
<L>I marry Mi&s;s <HI>Hartley,</HI></L>
<L>Ergo. I get her Fortune.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="135" REF="137">I could hold out no longer, but in&s;tantly gave him the <HI>Negatur,</HI> with a Voice that made him &s;tart as if he had &s;een the Gho&s;ts of his Forefathers, for he had not per|ceived that I was in the Room.

Now this little Circum&s;tance I &s;ay, (knowing the Man's Stile and Cha|racter,) as well as &s;everal others, had made me for &s;ome Time &s;u&s;|pect that the old Gentleman and <HI>Pedant</HI> had &s;ome &s;illy Piece of Con|trivance in their Head. However, as nothing very Material appeared, I doubted not but that with the
<PB N="136" REF="138">
Help of my Dear Divinity, I &s;hould be able gradually to Counteract them, before they brought any Thing to a Conclu&s;ion. The Event however proved the Contrary; and as the Suddenne&s;s of their Explo|&s;ion, left me no Opportunity for Sap or Countermine in my Opera|tions, I was oblige to commit every Thing to the Hazard of a <HI>Coup de Main,</HI> in which I happily &s;ucceeded. Going a few Mornings &s;ince, I be|lieve it was <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> into <HI>Kitty's</HI> Dre&s;&s;ing-room, "O <HI>Ea&s;y,"</HI> &s;ays &s;he, and I thought &s;he &s;eemed net|tled at &s;omething, "I'm glad you are come to give me Joy! <HI>Monday</HI> next is the Day fixed on for my being made happy, that is you know, in my Father's Dialect, being mar|ried to <HI>Pedant."

<PB N="137" REF="139">
was my Reply. "And more than that," continued &s;he, "He is &s;o Paternal as to tell me that I <HI>&s;hall</HI> be made happy then, whether I like it or not. If he thinks he can effect this, I fancy he will be about as cunning as <HI>Sancho</HI> in his Govern|ment, when he &s;entenced a Crimi|nal to <HI>&s;leep</HI> &s;o many Nights in Pri&s;on. But what is to be done, <HI>Ea&s;y?</HI> What Mea&s;ures can we take to prevent all this? For you know if one did feel an odd Fancy to accept of the Wretch, one would chu&s;e to take one's own Time about it." Was not this a fair Opening <HI>Charles?</HI> Little Cupid, who I &s;uppo&s;e &s;at upon my Shoulder, im|mediately whi&s;per'd, <HI>"Scotland</HI> and a Po&s;t-chai&s;e and Four," and offer|ed him&s;elf as fir&s;t Po&s;tillion. Faith

I thought the young Fellow advi&s;ed very &s;en&s;ibly; &s;o as he had men|tioned it in Confidence to me, I could not do otherwi&s;e than com|municate it between a Ki&s;s and a Whi&s;per to the Ear of my <HI>Kitty.</HI> She look'd a little Queerly at the Propo&s;al, and he&s;itated, and &s;aid nothing. When a Woman does not ab&s;olutely &s;tart at the fir&s;t In|timation of a Thing of this Na|ture, you may make your&s;elf &s;ure of her Con&s;enting within half an Hour, if it is not your own Fault. So having once broke the Ice, I thought it better, like old <HI>Hartley,</HI> to "Strike whil&s;t the Iron is hot," and urged my Propo&s;al upon her with all the Rhetoric I was ma&s;ter of. I exaggerated the inevitable Danger &s;he expo&s;ed her&s;elf to, by
<PB N="139" REF="141">
delaying any longer; expatiated upon the unhappy Ob&s;tinacy of her Father's Temper; that as he had hitherto kept his De&s;igns &s;o &s;ecret as to the Time intended for her Marriage, it was too probable, that excited by his dete&s;table Coad|jutor, he would adopt Mea&s;ures for the effecting it, which mu&s;t ut|terly Ruin all our Pro&s;pects. That it was not to be doubted but that her Father, though he might at fir&s;t be highly di&s;plea&s;ed with the Step I propo&s;ed, would &s;oon, upon Con&s;ideration, &s;ee Things in a pro|per Light, and even be inclined to thank us for Counteracting him. That all his Friends, &s;he very well knew, had invariably condemned his &s;trange Idea of &s;acrificing his Daughter to a Bookworm. That
<PB N="140" REF="142">
their Opinions would certainly have great Weight with him, when the Delu&s;ion he at pre&s;ent laboured under was removed. That, as &s;he knew how well he loved her, his Di&s;plea&s;ure would fall in &s;ome Part upon <HI>Pedant;</HI> mutual Recri|minations would en&s;ue, and the Animal would &s;how him&s;elf in his proper Colours. That, at all Events, her Father's &s;trange Treat|ment of her in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, would entirely ju&s;tify her Mea&s;ures; and that I could not &s;ay, however highly I reverenced the Duty of Children towards their Parents, that I thought it &s;hould be ob&s;erved implicitly, when &s;o great a Stake as one's own Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery was depend|ing." Whil&s;t I was haranguing thus finely, I could perceive by five

hundred little Changes in her Countenance, what an internal Conte&s;t &s;he was engaged in. For In&s;tance, there was Love I &s;uppo&s;e, and the Novelty of the Thing, and a little Pique again&s;t her Fa|ther; all Volunteers on my Side the Que&s;tion. Then there was Prudence, and Propriety, and Punc|tilio, and a whole Mu&s;ter-roll of Pre&s;byterian Virtues, like a City Militia, on the other. And like a City Militia there they &s;tood by each other, all in Form no doubt, and made a great Show of Re&s;i&s;t|ance; but as &s;oon as the other Party charged home upon them, away they ran as if the Devil was at their Heels, and not two were to be found together 'till all the Dan|ger was over. For gue&s;&s;ing how
<PB N="142" REF="144">
Matters &s;tood with her, I brought up to the Attack a Reinforcement of Arguments; and at la&s;t, as the Reward for all my Trouble, drew from her Lips a dear Kind of half denying Affirmative, which I took immediate Advantage of, by run|ning out of the Room whil&s;t &s;he remained in the right Humour, and in &s;hort conducted every thing with &s;o much Vigour, that I be|lieve within two Hours from the Time of our Con&s;ultation, we found our&s;elves Cheek by Jole in a Po&s;t-chai&s;e together.</P>
<P>And here we are now in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as happy as any two new married People can be. My dear Girl, with all "the Bloom of young De&s;ire, and purple light of Love" glowing in her Cheeks, is more winning

Soft, more amiably Mild than all the Heathen Beauties I ever heard or read of, if they were put toge|ther, with their Godde&s;&s;es at the Head of them.

And every now and then &s;he is &s;o prettily Pen&s;ive, which I love her ten Times more for, from the Novelty of the Thing. O <HI>Melmoth,</HI> how rejoiced I am on all Accounts at what has happened. For if her Father had been le&s;s Precipitate and Peremptory, and I had not taken her at the In&s;tant when every Thing was favourable, the little Gip&s;y might have played me on and off for this Twelvemonth,

Or, perhaps he means to try whether their Pa&s;&s;ion will bear Change of Country; and con&s;iders no Love as a true one, which is not &s;ufficient to keep a Man warm &s;o many Degrees Northward, and enable him to write Odes like a <HI>Laplander</HI> to his <HI>Orra Moor,</HI> tho' he is Knee deep in Snow all the Time.</P>

<P>DAmnation, <HI>Charles Melmoth,</HI> I believe every body is mad, of our Acquaintance at lea&s;t, and are determined to make my Hou&s;e their Bedlam. Here's your Brother <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Maria</HI> in the fir&s;t Place; they have been prating and preach|ing and palavering one another over, till they have both per&s;uaded them|&s;elves they were in Love; and &s;o then my Uncle was to be wrote to, and fetched to &s;ee their Folly, and con&s;ent to <HI>their</HI> Running in Cou|ples.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="149">By and by I hear a confounded Noi&s;e and Rattle at my Gate, and who of all the Fools in the World &s;hould bolt out of a Po&s;t-chai&s;e, but our poor &s;illy Friend <HI>Ea&s;y,</HI> with <HI>Kitty Hartley</HI> tack'd to his Tail by Way of Help-mate. However, they have had a long Run for it, and good Sport I dare &s;wear. Let me &s;ee. A damn'd &s;illy Scheme of old <HI>Hartley</HI>'s about one <HI>Pedant,</HI> fir&s;t unkennell'd them. 'Twas at his Hou&s;e they broke cover. And then took off &s;trait an End to <HI>Edin|burgh.</HI> The old Fellow and <HI>Pe|dant</HI> after them, full cry. A fine Bur&s;t by God? Well, at <HI>Edin|burgh</HI> they headed back it &s;eems, and before old <HI>Hartley</HI> got there, were both earth'd &s;afe enough at <HI>Foxhall.</HI> However, the old Dog
<PB N="148" REF="150">
&s;tuck to the Scent, and was here ye&s;terday Morning by ten o'Clock to dig 'em out again. As for <HI>Pe|dant,</HI> he lagg'd, and was lo&s;t &s;ome how as &s;oon as he lo&s;t Scent of Matrimony. However, I'm glad to &s;ee <HI>Ea&s;y</HI> has &s;o much Bottom. I never thought he'd have run half &s;o well. And the old Buck is in good Humour too, now he finds Things can't be altered.</P>
<P>So I have got a fine Hou&s;efull of 'em too; and not a Creature, ex|cept your Brother, knows which Side of a Hor&s;e to mount on; like that poor &s;tupid Ra&s;cal <HI>Nineveh,</HI> that didn't know his Right-hand from his left, as King <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays. I wi&s;h you and your Wife were here with all my Soul, for the Lovers talk all of them &s;o much
<PB N="149" REF="151">
like Fools, and <HI>Hartley</HI> &s;o much like an old Schoolma&s;ter, that there's no bearing them; and my Uncle you know is a devili&s;h Slugg in Conver&s;ation at be&s;t. So that at pre&s;ent I'm ab&s;olutely not Ma&s;ter of my own Hou&s;e, and can hardly &s;queeze in a Word edgeways about <HI>Surly</HI> or my Che&s;nut Stone-hor&s;e. Faith I begin to find it very true, what my old Friend <HI>Virgil</HI> u&s;ed to tell me when I was at School, in his Art of Prophecy; that it was impo&s;&s;ible to couple a Hor&s;e's Neck to a Man's Head. I believe he &s;aid, People would laugh at you, if you tried at it.
<Q>Humano Capiti Ri&s;um tencatis Equinum,</Q>
You remember what I mean. And indeed he was pretty right there too, for they generally do when I
<PB N="150" REF="152">
begin; and <HI>Will Ea&s;y</HI> in particular, who knows no more of a Hor&s;e than I do of a Rhinoceros. Poor ignorant Fellow! And <HI>George</HI> too, though he &s;ometimes will ride with me, yet he always pulls his Boots off and Dre&s;&s;es when he comes in, and &s;cents him&s;elf with all Manner of Na&s;tine&s;s for my Si&s;ter to &s;mell to him. He never goes by my Kennel but the Dogs give tongue; and when he came down here, was mi&s;taken at two or three Inns for <HI>Bailey</HI> the great Perfumer in <HI>Cock|&s;pur-Street.</HI> So I'm always obliged to carry a Fox's Pad in my Pocket to prevent being infected. Love, Love, Love, and Ottah of Ro&s;es from Morning till Night! Damn it, I'll go and coquet with my Hor&s;e!</P>

<P>And here, if you plea&s;e, we will drop our Theatrical Embelli&s;h|ments,

and give you a plain Hi&s;to|rical Account of Things. I men|tioned in my la&s;t our Intention of &s;topping at Sir <HI>Thorobred</HI>'s, and di&s;patching our Penitentials from that Quarter. But the old Gen|tleman has &s;aved us the Trouble. For we had hardly been &s;tationed here four and twenty Hours, ju&s;t Time enough to tell our Adven|tures, eat a comfortable Meal, and enjoy a good Night's &s;leep upon it, when the next Morning about half an Hour after Breakfa&s;t, as I was &s;auntering in the Hall with the Baronet, I heard a Carriage &s;top at the Gate, and pre&s;ently in &s;tump'd old <HI>Hartley,</HI> with his two Ivory-headed Canes in one Hand, and his Hat and Handkerchief in
<PB N="155" REF="159">
the other. You may gue&s;s I found my&s;elf in a little <HI>Embarras</HI> at his appearing &s;o unexpectedly. Sir <HI>Thorobred</HI> advanced to receive him. <Q>He begg'd Pardon, he &s;aid, for troubling him with this Vi&s;it, but that it was needle&s;s to men|tion the Occa&s;ion of it, and that he &s;hould be glad of a little private Conver&s;ation with me.</Q> So in he went to Sir <HI>Thorobred</HI>'s Study; and I followed, with as little Inclination as ever I did at <HI>Eton</HI> to receive a Flogging. And faith I believe I look'd mon&s;trous &s;illy, not unlike a condemned Schoolboy. However, as it has been always a Rule invariable with me, whenever I am on the wrong Side of the Que&s;tion, to carry Matters
<PB N="156" REF="160">
with an high Hand; and behaving my&s;elf as the injured Per&s;on, to a&s;toni&s;h my Plaintiff into Silence by the unexpectedne&s;s of the Re|tort: I re&s;olved not to be wanting to my&s;elf in the pre&s;ent Attack, and had already prepared a tolera|ble Volley of Recrimination to counterpoi&s;e my Antagoni&s;t, when my Expectations were very agree|ably di&s;appointed. So far from arraigning me with all the ju&s;t Re&s;entment of an injured Parent, he only cen&s;ured me mildly for the Precipitancy and Unkindne&s;s of my Conduct towards him, and after &s;agaciou&s;ly remarking (which I &s;uppo&s;e he had di&s;covered in his Way from <HI>Edinburgh</HI> as well as our&s;elves,) that <Q>What was done
<PB N="157" REF="161">
could not be undone,</Q> and that <Q>We &s;hould always make the be&s;t of a bad Bargain,</Q> with a few more pretty Proverbials of the &s;ame Sort; he ab&s;olutely found me Guilty only of Petty Larceny, and enquired kindly after his Daughter, de&s;iring to &s;ee her. I need not tell you my Amazement at a Reception &s;o entirely unhoped for, nor of the many Vows and Prote&s;tations I gave him in return for it. I ran up Stairs to <HI>Kitty,</HI> whom I found with Mi&s;s <HI>Rugg</HI> at her Elbow, in no &s;mall Con&s;terna|tion. My Intelligence was Spirits of Hart&s;horn to her. Down &s;he came in&s;tantly, not forgetting however to look as Melancholy and Repentant as po&s;&s;ible, and threw her&s;elf at
<PB N="158" REF="162">
his Feet. He, immediately rai&s;ed her up you know; and &s;o then, after allowing a &s;ufficient Quantity of Slobbering, and Ble&s;&s;ing, and White Handkerchief Work; all was well again. I believe we are all apt to form Judgments of People in Pro|portion to their good or bad Beha|viour towards our&s;elves, and in|deed we &s;hould be &s;ad Wretches if we did not &s;hew &s;ome &s;uch Gra|titude to our Benefactors; but I really think I never knew old <HI>Hartley</HI> &s;o agreeable, or felt half &s;o much regard for him, as at pre&s;ent. We all get our Health here as well as can be expected, and both young and old are exceed|ingly Convivial. In about a Week your poor Brother's Slip-Knot is
<PB N="159" REF="163">
to be drawn tight; and according to old <HI>Hartley,</HI> I am likely to come in for a &s;econd Edition of Matri|mony, as he &s;eems not at all &s;atis|fied with the Validity of any Thing on the other Side the <HI>Tweed.</HI> So "in for a Penny, in for a Pound," as they &s;ay; I have nothing to do but &s;ubmit my&s;elf. And yet I don't know, <HI>Charles!</HI> a <HI>Double Knot</HI> is confoundedly difficult to be untied, though one &s;hould have ever &s;o great a Mind for it. Well, God help us, poor Souls, &s;ince we mu&s;t <Q>March! Two and Two, <HI>Newgate</HI> Fa&s;hion!</Q> as <HI>Bardolph</HI> &s;ays. God help us, &s;ay I, and keep us all from Quarrelling, and that we may not hate one another,
<PB N="160" REF="164">
is the &s;incere Wi&s;h and Prayer of <HI>William Ea&s;y</HI> the married Man.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you that I could not re&s;t till I had en|deavoured to find out the Cau&s;e of <HI>Hartley</HI>'s wonderful Acquie&s;cence, and where his Rarity of a Com|panion had be&s;towed him&s;elf. Upon enquiring of his Servant, I found that his Ma&s;ter upon fir&s;t mi&s;&s;ing us, which was about two Hours after our Departure, flew into a mo&s;t violent Pa&s;&s;ion, and would have prepared for an im|mediate Pur&s;uit; (now I did not imagine he would have pur&s;ued us at all) but that upon <HI>Pedant</HI>'s over-per&s;ua&s;ion, they delayed it till the next Morning. That upon their Arrival at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> finding
<PB N="161" REF="165">
the Turtles paired and flown, the old Gentleman appeared very thoughtful; and hearing &s;ome how or other of our Intention to vi&s;it <HI>Foxhall,</HI> he determined to follow us thither, and propo&s;ed it to his Companion, who &s;eemingly ac|quie&s;ced. But that next Morning upon his enquiring after him at Breakfa&s;t, no <HI>Pedant</HI> was to be found, nor any body that could give the &s;malle&s;t Account of him. Old <HI>Hartley</HI> was incon&s;olable; and People were ju&s;t beginning to pro|po&s;e a grand Searching of Hor&s;e-ponds, Hog-tubs, and I &s;uppo&s;e Nece&s;&s;aries, had there been any; when one of the Po&s;tilions or Bootcatchers recollected, that he had &s;een a maddi&s;h looking Gentle|man go out of their Hou&s;e very
<PB N="162" REF="166">
early in the Morning to a Stage-Coach that was pa&s;&s;ing, which he believed he went away with, but could not tell whether it was in the In&s;ide or the Ba&s;ket. So here all our Wonderments are unriddled, and our Reception accounted for. For the &s;neaking Animal you &s;ee, finding all his Hopes at an End, thinks proper to &s;link off, and leave <HI>Hartley</HI> to make the be&s;t of it. This piques the old Gentleman, who begins at la&s;t to open his Eyes a little and perceive what a Fool he has been. And &s;o, con&s;idering as he &s;ays, that <Q>What is done cannot be undone,</Q> he re&s;olves to put the be&s;t Face upon Things, and make up his Mind as well as he can about it, before he &s;ees us. I wondered what the Deuce made
<PB N="163" REF="167">
him &s;o amazingly <HI>Piano</HI> upon the Occa&s;ion, but this clears up the My&s;tery. And as for <HI>Pedant,</HI> he has &s;hewn his Wi&s;dom too. For to be &s;ure his Appearance at the Baronet's mu&s;t have been rather a &s;illy one, circum&s;tanced as he was, like Squire <HI>Gawkey</HI> at the End of a Pantomime, when he finds <HI>Har|lequin</HI> in full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Mi&s;|tre&s;s. So All's well that Ends well, that I may conclude like my Father-in-law with a Proverb, and I forthwith &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>
