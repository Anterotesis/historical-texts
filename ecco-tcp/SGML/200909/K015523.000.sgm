<L>THIS night the Mu&s;e devotes to <HI>Days of Yore,</HI></L>
<L>When the fierce Dane in&s;ulted England's &s;hore;</L>
<L>She, haple&s;s i&s;le, in the wild tempe&s;t to&s;t,</L>
<L>Saw all but her inherent courage lo&s;t;</L>
<L>Like &s;ome &s;tout &s;hip, which, &s;inking to her grave,</L>
<L>Surveys what none but Briti&s;h hearts can brave,</L>
<L>Death in a thou&s;and &s;hapes of horror dre&s;t,</L>
<L>Night without &s;tars, and billows without re&s;t;</L>
<L>When &s;ome bold voice, loud as the roaring &s;ea,</L>
<L>Cries out&mdash;"All hands! the port is in our lea!"</L>
<L>In&s;tant they rou&s;e&mdash;brace up the &s;welling &s;ail,</L>
<L>She rights, &s;he lifts, &s;he rides before the gale;</L>
<L>Then &s;afe in port the joyous gla&s;s goes round,</L>
<L>And all pa&s;t &s;orrows in that gla&s;s are drown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So in the night of England's deep de&s;pair,</L>
<L>Great Alfred, i&s;&s;uing from his &s;ecret lair,</L>
<L>Ro&s;e like a meteor&mdash;The glad nation heard</L>
<L>His glorious call; and this was Alfred's word&mdash;</L>
<L>"Fight, fight! or peri&s;h in your country's cau&s;e,</L>
<L>"Stand for your king, your liberties, your laws:</L>
<L>"'Tis Alfred leads you on&mdash;his heart is true,</L>
<L>"And he, for whom your bleed, &s;hall bleed for you!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sons of that gallant race, to you we give</L>
<L>The&s;e pictur'd &s;cenes, in which your fathers live;</L>
<L>View them with candor, give the &s;ketch &s;ome prai&s;e,</L>
<L>Which features out the chiefs of ancient days</L>
<L>And recollect whatever here is &s;hewn,</L>
<L>Their cau&s;e, their courage, both are now your own:</L>
<L>They met the fierce invader at their doors,</L>
<L>No foes but captive foes invade your &s;hores;</L>
<L>Their wives, their daughters, fill'd the air with cries,</L>
<L>To your kind land the helple&s;s &s;ufferer flies;</L>
<L>Ble&s;t in a king, mild, merciful, and good,</L>
<L>Firm in allegiance to that king they &s;tood,</L>
<L>When they &s;aw death, di&s;ea&s;e, or danger near,</L>
<L>All, all was terror for a life &s;o dear.</L>
<L>The&s;e are the &s;cenes our drama &s;ets to view&mdash;</L>
<L>The moral of that fable re&s;ts with you.</L>

&s;helter from pur&s;uit of the victorious foe, that you wou'd importune
me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I need them all, yet a&s;k for nothing but your patient

</SP>

<P>Speak then, and to the point&mdash;be brief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goth.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;uits me &s;o to be, for I am &s;pent with 
<PB N="2" REF="5"> toil, and &s;orely bruis'd in fight under the walls of
Exeter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O&s;w.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas a di&s;a&s;trous day&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goth.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fatal one for Denmark&mdash;what thou|&s;ands fell in battle,
how many of your wretched countrymen were &s;laughter'd in pur&s;uit, or
pe|ri&s;h'd in the &s;ea, to which they fled, were hor|rible to tell. All, all
is lo&s;t&mdash;Alfred, invincible in arms, reigns in his people's hearts, for
virtue and for valour worthily (of force I mu&s;t confe&s;s it) &s;urnam'd the
Great.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O&s;w.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this be all, farewell!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, lady, hear me out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O&s;w.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have I not heard enough? Well may our cau&s;e be lo&s;t when we
have lo&s;t our courage. We have lived in England till we are become fat as the
&s;oil, and foggy as the climate: It is our meanne&s;s that makes Alfred great.
There was a Dane that made that great one tremble&mdash;Knew you not
Ha&s;tings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew him well, and honor tho&s;e who lov'd him; mo&s;t of all

<SPEAKER>O&s;w.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah! do you know me?</P>

<P>I know you for the widow of my chief&mdash;a noble gem hid in a

<P>Why then do you expo&s;e me to di&s;cove|ry?&mdash;Who and what
are you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gothrun the Dane&mdash;di&s;honour never yet was coupled to that
name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O&s;w.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor defeat till now; well may we &s;ay Alfred is great, when
he has conquer'd Goth|run.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goth.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is una&s;&s;ailable by open war; all Eng|land is his
garri&s;on; but tho' we cannot face him in the field, we may yet foil him by
&s;urprize and &s;tratagem&mdash;'Tis not the warrior's proce&s;s, I
con|fe&s;s; yet when all nobler means are out of reach, <PB N="3" REF="6"> hope
lo&s;t, his &s;oldiers &s;pirits &s;unk, his conqueror triumphant, and his own
life at ri&s;que, nature will rou&s;e him, in mere &s;elf-defence, to deal the
avenging &s;troke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O&s;w.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strike then, and vindicate your coun|try's cau&s;e&mdash;But
what can I do, living here by &s;ufferance under the watchful eye of the Earl
Oddune, who&s;e proud ca&s;tle overpeers my hum|ble cottage, and keeps all
around him in terror and &s;ubjection?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goth.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a &s;on&mdash;revenge is his inheri|tance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O&s;w.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a &s;on&mdash;but &s;uch a &s;on, alas! as cannot be
in&s;pir'd with any noble pa&s;&s;ion; lea&s;t of all with ambition or revenge:
His mind is like a tunele&s;s in&s;trument, un&s;trung, and not to be provok'd
by any touch, even of a ma&s;ter's hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unhappy tidings! if the &s;on of Ha&s;|tings and O&s;wena &s;o
degenerates, what hope is left? May I not &s;ee your &s;on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O&s;w.</SPEAKER>
<P>It were a &s;pectacle to wound the heart of any loyal Dane:
Whether his &s;pirit is debas'd by &s;pells and filtres (for rumor &s;peaks of
&s;uch) or that his father's death has plung'd him into grief, enervating his
faculties, I cannot &s;ay; but all the noble promi&s;e of his youth, like
blo&s;&s;oms &s;cat|ter'd by the ea&s;tern blight, is wither'd and
de|cay'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goth.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more; we are ob&s;erv'd&mdash;&s;ome one approaches, who&s;e
noble carriage ill accords with the mean garb he wears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O&s;w.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is my &s;on&mdash;'tis Voltimar him&s;elf&mdash;Oh! that a
&s;hrine &s;o rich &s;hou'd enca&s;e nought but beggary!</P>
<STAGE><PB N="4" REF="7">(VOLTIMAR enters.)</STAGE>
<P>How now! whence come you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Volt.</SPEAKER>
<P>From the &s;ea I come: I have brought fi&s;h to feed you: I
angled for them rarely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O&s;w.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were but fooli&s;h things, to be tre|pann'd by &s;uch a
witle&s;s angler.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Volt.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are Alfred's fi&s;h; land, &s;ea, and air are Alfred's.
Good chance but I am que&s;ti|on'd for con&s;piring the death of Alfred's
&s;ub|jects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goth.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's matter in that mind, altho' de|rang'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Volt.</SPEAKER>
<P>This man's a Dane; I know it by his locks, they are yellow like
my father's; his were a &s;hade betwixt the butter-flower and marygold, but
they are paler &s;ince his death; gri&s;ly and pale, a &s;ad, &s;ad
&s;pectacle.&mdash;There was blood upon his beard, when I &s;aw him
ye&s;ter-night, as I came home by moonlight from the beach. He nodded to me
thrice, and graciou&s;ly, as he pa&s;&s;ed on; but I was &s;car'd, and what
&s;mall wits I have wou'd not &s;tay by me;&mdash;&s;o he did not
&s;peak&mdash;was not that pitiful?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O&s;w.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that I had been with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Volt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh that you had! your &s;en&s;es are entire; mine
are&mdash;alas, alas! where are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Come, come, be pacified&mdash;another night I will go with you
to the &s;pot he vi&s;its.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you believe this vi&s;ion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O&s;w.</SPEAKER>
<P>Three &s;everal times within the&s;e few days pa&s;t he has
repeated the &s;ame tale.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Volt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, I have: three times, you are right; and eight days are
gone by; I notch'd them on my &s;taff. I can count ten, and there my learning
&s;tops.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>Goth.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is mo&s;t marvellous; his eye is &s;teady, his demeanor
grave, and, tho' his thoughts are wild, yet are they utter'd firmly, and in
lan|guage appo&s;ite: I can di&s;cern no outward &s;ymp|toms of an unfound
mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Volt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go, get you gone! why do you peer at me, and li&s;ten to my

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd you drive me away, being a friend and countryman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Volt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I keep the &s;eas for Alfred; I pay him tribute of the &s;poil I
take; and when I fle&s;h my hook I do pronounce his name three times for luck,
and then the &s;illy fry come to the bait re|ligiou&s;ly, and I catch
them&mdash;Oh! 'tis brave &s;port&mdash;I'll go again to-night, and if I meet
my father on the beach, &s;o you will watch, good mother, I will call to

<P>No, no, no; &s;end hence that ugly man; he means no good&mdash;I
will not fight again&s;t the king, not I&mdash;be&s;ides, the &s;un is up, and
then I &s;leep till he reels home to bed like a hot fleckor'd reveller as he
is. The moon, the moon's my mi&s;tre&s;s; when &s;he's up, then I come out and
prowl upon the &s;hore to plant my ozier traps un|der the rocks, or fix my
baited trimmers in the &s;and, when the ebb leaves it dry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O&s;w.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you no feeling for your country's fate? Stay, and this
warrior will de&s;cribe the battle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Volt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let him not tell me what I &s;aw my&s;elf. Twelve miles upon the
&s;tretch I ran to Haldown hill, that overlooks the field; the roebuck or the
hart cannot out&s;trip me on the level plain. I &s;aw <PB N="6" REF="9"> the
Dani&s;h ho&s;t &s;cattered like &s;heep. By &s;ea, earth, air, and fire! if I
were other than the the thing I am, I could have told them where to plant a

feigns infanity for purpo&s;es conceal'd and &s;ecret, is not for me to &s;ay;
but this I boldly will aver, his name alone will be a tower of &s;trength, and
