<HEAD><HI>Unto the Right Honourable, the Lords of Council and Se&s;&s;ion,</HI> THE PETITION OF John and William Cunningham and Company brewers in Gla&s;|gow, James Hotchkis and Company brewers in Edinburgh, and James Graham vintner in Gla&s;gow, for them&s;elves, and as tru|&s;tees of William M'Gregor late tenant in Parkhall,</HEAD>
<OPENER>Humbly &s;heweth,</OPENER>
<P>IN reclaiming again&s;t the Lord Auchinleck's interlocutor, to be in the &s;equel more particularly &s;tated, the points propo&s;ed to be &s;ubmitted to your Lord&s;hips review, are, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> Whether certain tacks granted by Mr Hamilton of Wi&s;haw to Wil|liam M'Gregor were adjudgeable at the in&s;tance of the now peti|tioners his creditors? <HI>2dly,</HI> The exceptions that are taken to the adjudication at Wi&s;haw's own in&s;tance, adjudging <HI>inter alia</HI> the&s;e very tacks. And the facts upon which the que&s;tion ari&s;es, are the&s;e following.</P>
<P>BY tack, of this date, Charles Hamilton of Wi&s;haw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 12. 1761.</NOTE> now de|cea&s;ed, let to William M'Gregor and his heirs, &s;ecluding &s;ub-te|nants and a&s;&s;ignees, except by the &s;pecial con&s;ent of the proprie|tor, the lands of Ea&s;ter-Park and Birkenhill, for the &s;pace of fifty-&s;even years, commencing at Martinmas 1761, for a rent or tack-duty of <HI>L.</HI> 76 : 2 : 6 Sterling; and a liberty was thereby granted
<PB N="2" REF="2">to M'Gregor of &s;ub&s;etting part of &s;aid lands during the fir&s;t nine|teen years.</P>
<P>BY another tack,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 17. 1763.</NOTE> of this date, the &s;aid Charles Hamilton let to the &s;aid William M'Gregor and his heirs, &s;ecluding &s;ub-tenants and a&s;&s;ignees, except they be of an unexceptionable good charac|ter, the Mill of Newark, mill-lands, thirlage, and &s;ucken thereto pertaining, for the &s;pace of thirty-&s;even years from and after Mar|tinmas 1762, for a rent or tack-duty of 100 merks Scots.</P>
<P>BY a third tack,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 6. 1763.</NOTE> of this date, the &s;aid Charles Hamilton let to the &s;aid William M'Gregor and his heirs and a&s;&s;ignees, of no higher degree than him&s;elf, the lands of Slaymuir, for the &s;pace of fifty-&s;even years from and after Martinmas 1762, and for a rent or tack-duty of <HI>L.</HI> 4 Sterling.</P>
<P>BY a fourth tack,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 23. and 25. 1761.</NOTE> of this date, the &s;aid Charles Hamilton let to David Gardiner and his heirs the lands of Windiehall, for a term of nineteen years, commencing from Martinmas 1759, for a tack-duty of <HI>L.</HI> 8, 6 <HI>s.</HI> Sterling, to which tack la&s;t above mentioned the &s;aid William M'Gregor and John Burns acquired right.</P>
<P>AND by an after-agreement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 27. 1765.</NOTE> of this date, pa&s;&s;ed betwixt the &s;aid William M'Gregor and John Burns, they agreed to take in lea&s;e from Wi&s;haw certain parcels of the lands of Newark, at a rent of <HI>L.</HI> 4 : 16 : 7 8/12 during the currency of Windiehall tack, with a power of &s;ub&s;etting; which propo&s;als Wi&s;haw accepted of, and in virtue thereof, M'Gregor entered into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and has &s;ince &s;ub&s;et the &s;ame.</P>
<P>YOUR Lord&s;hips have formerly had occa&s;ion to hear of the va|rious &s;chemes devi&s;ed by Wi&s;haw and the &s;aid William M'Gregor for rai&s;ing the e&s;tate of Wi&s;haw to an immen&s;e value; and it was in pro&s;ecution of the&s;e aerial projects, that M'Gregor, &s;eemingly in a flouri&s;hing way, but in reality bankrupt and in&s;olvent to a great degree, if he is truly re&s;ting the large &s;ums he is &s;aid to be due to Wi&s;haw, found means to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the &s;ums he owes to his other creditors.</P>
<P>WISHAW had obtained bonds of relief from M'Gregor for &s;un|dry large &s;ums, in which they were jointly bound; and they were
<PB N="3" REF="3">bound in others bonds, for which no bond of relief appeared. Wi|&s;haw could not be ignorant of M'Gregor's in&s;olvent &s;tate, with whom he was &s;o nearly connected, and bound along&s;t with him in &s;uch large &s;ums unknown to the other creditors, &s;everals of whom, under the apprehen&s;ion that his affairs were not in the be&s;t &s;ituation, were <HI>in cur&s;u diligentiae.</HI></P>
<P>TO fru&s;trate the effect of the&s;e, and to cover and protect M'Gre|gor's effects from the diligence of his creditors, Wi&s;haw thought proper, whether by him&s;elf or by the moyen of his factor is im|material, to elicite from M'Gregor, of this date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 28. 1767.</NOTE> a di&s;po&s;ition <HI>om|nium bonorum</HI> of his whole &s;ubjects heritable and moveable, inclu|ding his hou&s;ehold-furniture, and the very liquor in his cellars.</P>
<P>THAT this was a fraudulent and collu&s;ive deed, for the purpo&s;e above mentioned, is apparent from this &s;ingle circum&s;tance, that though conceived in the form of an immediate conveyance of all and &s;ingular the premi&s;es, including the above-mentioned tacks, M'Gregor was allowed to continue in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;o far down as the 8th and 9th days of February 1768, when two in&s;truments of inti|mation and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the premi&s;es were taken in Wi&s;haw's name.</P>
<P>IN the mean time M'Gregor's in&s;olvency came to be generally known; whereupon the petitioners, who&s;e misfortune it is to be creditors to him in con&s;iderable &s;ums, were about to execute a poinding of his effects, when Wi&s;haw compeared and produced a mo&s;t extraordinary writing, containing a variety of ideal &s;chemes and propo&s;als for retrieving M'Gregor's circum&s;tance, and paying his debts.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e propo&s;als were &s;ubjoined the following words: <Q>I have confidered the above, and agree thereto;</Q> bearing no date, and kept in Wi&s;haw's pocket. And as it was part of &s;aid propo&s;als, That M'Gregor, upon the faith of future improvements, &s;hould pay an immen&s;e additional rent, from thenceforward Wi&s;haw was plea&s;ed to con&s;ider this as a new tack between him and M'Gregor; and having preferred a complaint to his own baron|bailie, took decreet for a large &s;um of arrears, computing the rent as &s;tated in the afore&s;aid propo&s;als, and thereupon execute one
<PB N="4" REF="4">poinding in his own name, and was conjoined with the petition|ers in another poinding.</P>
<P>WISHAW thereafter took adjudication again&s;t M'Gregor for va|rious large &s;ums, in which he was jointly bound with M'Gregor, and for mo&s;t of which he had bonds of relief; but there was one of the&s;e bonds for no le&s;s than <HI>L.</HI> 1000 Sterling, granted by them jointly to Jo&s;iah Corthine, for which he had no bond of relief, o|ther than what was contained in the afore&s;aid di&s;po&s;ition <HI>omnium bonorum,</HI> wherein M'Gregor was made to confe&s;s, That the whole of that &s;um was his proper debt.</P>
<P>M'GREGOR'S other creditors, and among&s;t the&s;e the petition|ers, did in like manner adjudge, and were within year and day of Wi&s;haw's adjudication.</P>
<P>UPON this title the petitioners brought a reduction of the afore|&s;aid memorial, which Wi&s;haw had been plea&s;ed to characterize <HI>a tack,</HI> of the baron-decreet, and poinding following thereon, and of the adjudication.</P>
<P>IT is unnece&s;&s;ary upon this occa&s;ion minutely to &s;tate the pro|ceedings in that proce&s;s. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that Wi&s;haw, anxious to avoid the appearances of collu&s;ion between him and his tenant, with whom in other re&s;pects he was &s;o deeply embark|ed, now a confe&s;&s;ed bankrupt, did judicially di&s;claim the di&s;po&s;i|tion <HI>omnium bonorum,</HI> throwing the blame of it upon his factor, as taken without his knowledge.</P>
<P>A MULTIPLE-POINDING was brought in name of the tenants, calling the petitioners and Wi&s;haw to di&s;pute their preferences, when the &s;everal adjudications of M'Gregor's &s;ubjects being pro|duced, it was objected on the part of Wi&s;haw, That the tack, of date 12th Augu&s;t 1761, which excluded a&s;&s;ignees and &s;ub-tenants, was not adjudgeable. And it was on the other hand contended, That however effectual &s;uch clau&s;e might be to exclude a volunta|ry a&s;&s;ignation, it could not bar the diligence of lawful creditors. Upon which the Lord Ordinary pronounced the following interlo|cutor: <Q>Having con&s;idered the mutual memorials,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 2. 1769.</NOTE> Finds, That when a proprietor &s;ets his lands in lea&s;e to a tenant and his
<PB N="5" REF="5">heirs, excluding a&s;&s;ignees and &s;ub-tenants, this &s;hows, that he had in view, which is known to be common and natural, to favour a particular per&s;on and his family, and not to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the hard&s;hip of having a tenant forced in upon him, who upon many accounts might be di&s;agreeable: And there|fore finds this &s;eclu&s;ion is effectual, not only again&s;t voluntary a&s;&s;ignees, but al&s;o again&s;t legal a&s;&s;ignees by adjudication; con|&s;equently that the creditors of M'Gregor the tenant, by their adjudication of the tack of Ea&s;ter-Park and Birkenhill, can take nothing, and have no title to compete with Mr Hamilton the proprietor. Finds, That &s;o far as concerns the tack of Breaken|brae and others, let to M'Gregor and Burns, without any &s;eclu|&s;ion of a&s;&s;ignees, that Mr Hamilton, in virtue of his adjudica|tion, has right to the &s;ame; and that the other creditors have no right thereto, in re&s;pect that tack is not adjudged by them: And with re&s;pect to the tacks of the lands of Slaemuir, and the mill of Newark, with the pendicle therein mentioned, which are ad|judged by all the competitors, and their adjudications within year and day of another, finds them all <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> prefera|ble; but that Mr Hamilton, as the fir&s;t effectual adjudger, mu&s;t draw in the fir&s;t place the expence of his adjudication; and that he mu&s;t, as proprietor, be paid up the rent of the&s;e &s;ubjects for crop 1766, and in time coming, &s;o far as re&s;ting owing.</Q></P>
<P>AGAINST which interlocutor both parties having repre&s;ented; and in the repre&s;entation for Wi&s;haw, a new objection being &s;ta|ted to the whole adjudications for the other creditors, <HI>viz.</HI> That they had recovered payment of part of their debts by a poinding, and that notwith&s;tanding thereof, the adjudications had been ta|ken for the whole &s;ums, the Lord Ordinary pronounced this other interlocutor:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 25.1770.</NOTE> <Q>Having again con&s;idered this repre&s;entation with the an&s;wers, and re&s;umed the con&s;ideration of the repre&s;enta|tion for Mr Hamilton of Wi&s;haw, to which no an&s;wers have been given in, though the time fixed for giving in an&s;wers is long expired; finds no &s;ufficient cau&s;e &s;hewn for altering the interlocutor, &s;o far as thereby Mr Hamilton is found to have a preferable right to the tack of Ea&s;ter-Park and Birkenhill, and that the &s;ame is not adjudgeable by the competing creditors: But in re&s;pect of the <HI>pluris petitio</HI> in the adjudications of the creditors competing with him, fully &s;et forth in his repre&s;enta|tion,
<PB N="6" REF="6">to which no an&s;wers are made, holds the other creditors as confe&s;&s;ed on the truth of the&s;e averments; and therefore finds the&s;e adjudications void, and perfers Mr Hamilton of Wi&s;haw upon his adjudication upon the whole tacks, and recals the <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> preference given to the other creditors upon the tacks &s;pe|cified in the former interlocutor; and finds no nece&s;&s;ity now to determine the que&s;tion, Whether Mr Hamilton is intitled to draw the whole, or only a part of the expence of his adjudica|tion in preference to the other creditors, as the adjudications of the&s;e creditors being annulled, puts an end thereto.</Q></P>
<P>AGAINST which interlocutor la&s;t above recited, a repre&s;entation being preferred for the now petitioners, wherein the following points were in&s;i&s;ted upon; <HI>1&s;t,</HI> That the objection of a <HI>pluris peti|tio</HI> did not &s;trike again&s;t one of the adjudications, <HI>viz.</HI> that at the in&s;tance of Grahame; and therefore that that adjudication be|hoved to be effectual not only again&s;t &s;uch of the tacks as did not exclude a&s;&s;ignees and &s;ub-tenants, but al&s;o again&s;t the tack of Ea&s;ter-Park and Birkenhill, <HI>quoad</HI> &s;o much of the lands in &s;aid tack as M'Gregor was thereby at liberty to &s;ub&s;et; <HI>2dly,</HI> That it was equally effectual to carry the &s;um of <HI>L.</HI> 70 which Wi&s;haw was thereby bound to pay to M'Gregor in the event of his taking advantage of the breach of the tack thereby allowed; <HI>3dly,</HI> That Wi&s;haw's adjudication was liable to certain objections therein &s;ta|ted, which ought to be available to annul the &s;ame <HI>in totum,</HI> or at lea&s;t to re&s;trict it to a &s;ecurity; And <HI>4thly,</HI> That &s;uppo&s;ing Wi|&s;haw's adjudication to be &s;u&s;tained, as a fir&s;t effectual adjudicati|on, it ought to be a&s;certained by what proportion the&s;e expences ought to be paid out of the different &s;ubjects adjudged; the Lord Ordinary, upon advi&s;ing the &s;ame with a counter-repre&s;entation for Wi&s;haw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 19. 1770.</NOTE> pronounced this other interlocutor: <Q>Having again con&s;idered this repre&s;entation with the counter-repre&s;entation for the other creditors of M'Gregor, and the mutual an&s;wers, repre&s;entation, and replies for the other criditors, and an&s;wers for Mr Hamilton of Wi&s;haw, adheres to the former interlocutor, with the following variations: <HI>1&s;t,</HI> Finds, That only three of the adjudications are void and null, on account of the <HI>pluris pe|titio, viz.</HI> tho&s;e at the in&s;tance of Me&s;&s;. Cuninghams and Hotchkis; but finds the &s;aid nullity does not affect James Grahame's adjudication: And further, finds, That James
<PB N="7" REF="7">Grahame, in con&s;equence of that adjudication, is intitled to come in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with Mr Hamilton for the&s;e tacks which M'Gregor had power to &s;ub&s;et, as al&s;o for the <HI>L.</HI> 70 &s;tipulated by the lea&s;e; and refu&s;es the &s;everal repre&s;entations as to all o|ther points.</Q></P>
<P>OF the&s;e interlocutors, in &s;o far as it is thereby found that the tack of Ea&s;ter-Park and Birkenhill, for a term of fifty-&s;even years, excluding a&s;&s;ignees and &s;ub-tenants, without the &s;pecial con&s;ent of the proprietor, is not adjudgeable; and in &s;o far as the objections to Wi&s;haw's adjudications are repelled, the petitioners are now humbly to pray your Lord&s;hips review.</P>
<P>AND with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, the petitioners will be al|lowed to a&s;&s;ume this general propo&s;ition, That it is adver&s;e to the fir&s;t principles of law and ju&s;tice, that any beneficial e&s;tate &s;hould be &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed in the per&s;on of a debtor, as to &s;ecure to him the enjoyment thereof, and, at the &s;ame time, to exclude the diligence of his lawful creditors. If the &s;eclu&s;ion of a&s;&s;ignees has the effect of barring the diligence of creditors by adjudication, the con&s;e|quence is plain, that a tenant, who cannot be removed by the he|ritor, and who&s;e voluntar a&s;&s;ignment has no other effect but to void the a&s;&s;ignation, and does not annul the tack it&s;elf, will keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands, reap the fruits and profits thereof, and en|joy all the emoluments of the tack, whil&s;t his lawful creditors; with who&s;e money he purcha&s;ed the tack, pay a large <HI>gra&s;&s;un,</HI> and improves the lands, are di&s;abled from affecting the &s;ame for their payment. The ma&s;ter refu&s;es his con&s;ent either to a voluntary or legal a&s;&s;ignment of the tack; and as the tenant cannot be removed till the i&s;&s;ue of the tack, he enjoys the benefit thereof, in defiance of his creditors.</P>
<P>THE particular circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e &s;tate the hard&s;hips of this principle in a &s;trong point of view. M'Gregor purcha&s;es a tack from Wi&s;haw for a term of no le&s;s than fifty-&s;even years, to him and his heirs, &s;ecluding a&s;&s;ignees and &s;ub-tenants, without the &s;pecial con&s;ent of the proprietor. He is in good credit at the time; borrows at all hands; makes expen&s;ive meliorations on the &s;ubjects &s;et, by buildings, machinery, and otherwi&s;e, to the a|mount of about <HI>L.</HI> 1500 Sterling. He then becomes bankrupt;
<PB N="8" REF="8">and, in collu&s;ion with his ma&s;ter, to the the prejudice of his other lawful creditors, grants to him a di&s;po&s;ition <HI>omnium bonorum,</HI> al|lows a decreet to pa&s;s again&s;t him, at his ma&s;ter's in&s;tance, for large &s;ums which were not ju&s;tly due. Wi&s;haw him&s;elf adjudges this very tack, which was at the &s;ame time conveyed to him by the general di&s;po&s;ition; and when the other creditors have likewi&s;e adjudged the &s;ame tack, they are told by Wi&s;haw, that the tack was not adjudgeable.</P>
<P>THE apparent inju&s;tice of this propo&s;ition &s;eems to have intro|duced a di&s;tinction in the con&s;truction of clau&s;es of this nature, between a voluntary a&s;&s;ignation, and an attachment of the right by legal diligence.</P>
<P>THUS in the ca&s;e of Bruce <HI>contra</HI> Buckie, as far back as the 3d February 1619, judgment was given, <Q>Finding that a rever&s;ion granted to any per&s;on and his heirs, &s;ecluding a&s;&s;ignees, may be compri&s;ed.</Q>&mdash;And again, in the ca&s;e of Bruce <HI>contra</HI> Va&s;&s;als of Lochleven, 30th July 1680, ob&s;erved by Lord Fountainhall, <Q>The rever&s;ion in a wad&s;et being granted to the rever&s;er and his heirs, but not to a&s;&s;ignees, the Lords, in a pur&s;uit at the in|&s;tance of an a&s;&s;ignee, found this &s;ufficient to exclude him &s;o long as he in&s;i&s;ted on his voluntary di&s;po&s;ition; but that this would not found again&s;t him when he produced a right from compri&s;ers of the &s;ubject, unle&s;s the rever&s;ion was &s;o per&s;onal as to include both a&s;&s;ignees and compri&s;ers.</Q> The plain import of which was, that however the clau&s;e, &s;ecluding a&s;&s;ignees, may be available to exclude voluntary a&s;&s;ignees, it ought not to be ex|tended to exclude the legal diligence of creditors, compri&s;ers of the right, where the &s;ame was not expre&s;sly &s;ecluded.</P>
<P>IN oppo&s;ition to the&s;e, reference was made to a later deci&s;ion of this Court, 4th December 1747, in the ca&s;e of William Elliot <HI>con|tra</HI> the Duke of Buccleugh, where it was found, that a tack, &s;e|cluding a&s;&s;ignees, could not be adjudged. What &s;pecialties may have occurred in that ca&s;e, your petitioners cannot take upon them to &s;ay. It is very imperfectly &s;tated in Falconer's Collection; and, at any rate, it is but a &s;ingle deci&s;ion, repugnant to the former deci&s;ions of this Court; &s;o that the point merits well to be con&s;i|dered, before it is e&s;tabli&s;hed to be law.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">THE clau&s;e in this tack, excluding a&s;&s;ignees and &s;ub-tenants, is qualified with this exception, <Q>Except by the &s;pecial con&s;ent of the proprietor;</Q> and therefore it may ju&s;tly be doubted, whe|ther any more was thereby intended, but a re&s;erved faculty to the ma&s;ter to refu&s;e his con&s;ent to a voluntar a&s;&s;ignment, upon ju&s;t and rea&s;onable grounds; and con&s;equently not to comprehend the diligence of lawful creditors adjudging this valuable part of their bankrupt debtor's e&s;tate.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort lea&s;es, a <HI>dilectio per&s;onae</HI> may be pre&s;umed: But where a tack is granted for &s;uch a long term of years to the lea&s;ee and his heirs, in whom there can be no &s;uch <HI>dilectio,</HI> being per&s;ons un|known at the time, there is not equal rea&s;on to extend the exclu|&s;ion to exclude the diligence of lawful creditors.</P>
<P>AND in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, there occurs this remarkable &s;pe|cialty, which demon&s;trates Wi&s;haw's own &s;en&s;e of the matter, <HI>viz.</HI> That it was he who led the way, by taking the fir&s;t ad|judication adjudging this very tack; and that equality which the law maintains with re&s;pect to the whole creditors of a bankrupt, by bringing in all adjudgers <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> who are within year and day of the fir&s;t effectual adjudication, will never permit his di&s;pen&s;ing with the clau&s;e &s;ecluding a&s;&s;ignees, &s;o far as regards his own diligence, and to lay hold of it to exclude the diligence of other creditors. Wi&s;haw's adjudication, now that he has repudiated the di&s;po&s;ition <HI>omnium bonorum,</HI> is his only title to this tack. He mu&s;t therefore take that &s;pecies of diligence as qualified by law, and with all its legal effects; one of which is, that every adjudication led within year and day is intitled to come in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> along with it: So that having di&s;pen&s;ed with the &s;e|clu&s;ion of a&s;&s;ignees in favours of one adjudication, he mu&s;t be under&s;tood to have di&s;pen&s;ed with it in favours of all the other adjudications, which the law brings in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with it.</P>
<P>AND therefore, to conclude upon this point, the petitioners humbly &s;ubmit to your Lord&s;hips, That the clau&s;e of &s;eclu&s;ion, qualified as above, in a tack of &s;uch a long endurance, does not exclude the diligence of lawful creditors by adjudication; and that as Wi&s;haw him&s;elf, in the character of creditor, has taken adjudication of this very tack, and which is his only title there|to, he has thereby not only &s;hown his own &s;en&s;e and under&s;tand|ing
<PB N="10" REF="10">of that clau&s;e, which meant only to exclude voluntary a&s;&s;ig|nees, but has thereby con&s;ented to the adjudications of other cre|ditors within year and day of his, the fir&s;t effectual adjudica|tion.</P>
<P>THE other point propo&s;ed for your Lord&s;hips con&s;ideration, re|&s;pects the exceptions that have been taken to Wi&s;haw's adjudica|tion, not only as to what re&s;pects the above-mentioned tack of the lands of Ea&s;ter-Park and Birkenhill, but M'Gregor's whole other e&s;tate.</P>
<P>AND in &s;o far as that adjudication proceeds upon Wi&s;haw and M'Gregor's joint bond to Collector Corthine, June 3. 1765, for <HI>L.</HI> 1000 Sterling, it is an agreed fact, That no bond of relief was granted therefor till the 28th October 1767, when the di&s;po&s;ition <HI>omnium bonorum</HI> was granted by M'Gregor in favours of Wi&s;haw; wherein M'Gregor is made to confe&s;s, that that was his proper debt, in which Wi&s;haw was only cautioner for him.</P>
<P>THE granting &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, at the time when the other creditors were proceeding in diligence to operate their payment again&s;t M'Gregor and his effects, was <HI>per &s;e</HI> an act of nottour bank|ruptcy, and was in other re&s;pects the act of fraud between per&s;ons &s;o intimately connected, with an intention to fru&s;trate the dili|gence of the other creditors. The bond granted to Collector Cor|thine proves this to have been their joint debt, and con&s;quently that M'Gregor had relief again&s;t Wi&s;haw for the one half. This relief he gives away by the di&s;po&s;ition <HI>omnium bonorum,</HI> and takes the whole debt upon him, by the acknowledgment therein contain|ed, of Wi&s;haw's being but cautioner for him therein. Was this to be allowed, to bring &s;o great a debt upon the bankrupt's e&s;tate, there would be no &s;ecurity again&s;t fraudulent contrivances of this kind. The other creditors were <HI>in cur&s;u diligentiae.</HI> M'Gregor's claim of relief again&s;t Wi&s;haw for the half of this debt was part of the bankrupt's e&s;tate. This he gives away by the di&s;po&s;ition <HI>omnium bonorum,</HI> and &s;ubmits to take the whole of that debt upon him&s;elf. How far it would be proper or ju&s;t to &s;u&s;tain a device of this kind, is humbly &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>AND if your Lord&s;hips &s;hall be of opinion that this objection is well founded, it mu&s;t be effectual either totally to annul Wi&s;haw's adju|dication,
<PB N="11" REF="11">&s;o far as it is taken for the whole &s;ums, principal, an|nualrent, and penalties in the bond to Collector Corthine, or at lea&s;t to re&s;trict the &s;ame to a &s;ecurity for the one half of the prin|cipal &s;um and annualrents.</P>
<P>BUT the objection does not re&s;t here: For your Lord&s;hips have heard that Wi&s;haw has judicially di&s;claimed and renounced that di&s;po&s;ition <HI>omnium bonorum,</HI> as taken from M'Gregor by his factor, without any authority from him, and without his privity and knowledge.</P>
<P>WISHAW is indeed plea&s;ed to &s;ay, That that di&s;clamation ought to be extended no further than to repudiate the di&s;po&s;ition <HI>omnium bonorum,</HI> but by no means to comprehend the acknowledgement therein contained of Wi&s;haw's being but cautioner for M'Gregor in &s;aid bond: But this is a di&s;tinction which your Lord&s;hips will never allow. He has been obliged to confe&s;s that that deed was taken without his authority, privity, or knowledge. He therefore di&s;claimed the &s;ame; and that acknowledgement or di&s;clamation cannot now be &s;plit, &s;o as to &s;upport it in one part, and reject it in another. The whole was a fraudulent contrivance, and mu&s;t &s;tand or fall in whole.</P>
<P>BUT the petitioners do further in&s;i&s;t, That Wi&s;haw's adjudica|tion is equally exceptionable, &s;o far as it proceeds upon the other grounds of debt wherein M'Gregor and he were jointly bound, and for which Wi&s;haw had a bond of relief.</P>
<P>THE bond of relief, of this date, recites &s;everal debts in which Wi&s;haw was bound jointly with M'Gregor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 11. 1764.</NOTE> all which M'Gregor thereby acknowledges to have been his proper debts, and therefore becomes bound and obliged to free, relieve, and &s;kaithle&s;s keep Wi&s;haw, and his heirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of &s;aid &s;everal &s;ums, principal, annualrents, and liquidate penalties, and of all damages, expences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>and for that effect, <HI>&s;o &s;oon as required by Wi&s;haw or his fore&s;aids,</HI> to make payment to the &s;everal creditors therein named of their re&s;pective principal &s;ums and annualrents, and to deliver up to Wi&s;haw the principal bonds, or &s;ufficient di&s;charges of the &s;ame; or otherwi&s;e to make payment to Wi&s;haw of the princi|pal &s;ums, annualrents, and penalties, to the end he may apply the &s;ame towards operating his relief of &s;aid bonds.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="12" MS="y">No &s;uch requi&s;ition was ever made; but, in lieu thereof, Wi|&s;haw, of this date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 11. 1768.</NOTE> took decreet again&s;t M'Gregor for payment of the whole &s;ums, principal, annualrent, and penalties contained in the afore&s;aid bond.</P>
<P>THAT Wi&s;haw might have adjudged for &s;ecurity and relief of the&s;e debts which were &s;till out&s;tanding unpaid by Wi&s;haw, the petitioners &s;hall readily admit. But as Wi&s;haw had not paid the&s;e debts to the creditors; and as the obligation upon M'Gregor in the afore&s;aid bond of relief, to make payment of the&s;e &s;ums to Wi&s;haw him&s;elf, was &s;o qualified as only to take effect, in ca&s;e M'Gregor, when required &s;o to do, &s;hould fail or neglect to make payment of the &s;ums to the proper creditor, and either to retire and deliver up the bonds them&s;elves, or di&s;charges of the &s;ame; and as no &s;uch requi&s;ition was ever made; the petitioners do humbly contend, that the adjudication was improper and illegal, which therefore ought to be annulled <HI>in totum.</HI> And as Wi&s;haw has pre|vailed in reducing the whole adjudications of the whole other cre|ditors, one only excepted, upon a mere omi&s;&s;ion of the creditors agent in the country neglecting to advi&s;e their town-agent of the partial payment they had recovered on a poinding, he can with no rea&s;on complain when the &s;ame mea&s;ure is dealt to him, thereby to bring him on a level with the other creditors, at lea&s;t equally onerous.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>May it therefore plea&s;e your Lord&s;hips, to alter the Lord Or|dinary's interlocutors in the above-mentioned particulars: And, in the 1&s;t place, To repel the objection to the other creditors ad|judications &s;o far as regards the tack of Ea&s;ter-Park and Bir|kenhill, founded upon the clau&s;e, &s;ecluding a&s;&s;ignees: 2dly, To &s;u&s;tain the objections to Wi&s;haw's adjudication, &s;o far as it proceeds upon the debt due to Collector Corthine, relevant to annul the &s;ame</HI> in totum, <HI>or at lea&s;t to re&s;trict it to a &s;e|curity for the one half of &s;aid principal &s;um and annulrents: 3dly, To &s;u&s;tain the other objection to Wi&s;haw's adjudication, as led for the whole of the afore&s;aid debts unpaid by Wi&s;haw at the time, without any previous requi&s;ition to M'Gregor in terms of the bond of relief, relevant to reduce that adjudication</HI> in totum. According to ju&s;tice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ALEX. LOCKHART.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
