<L>THE Sun, declining o'er the we&s;tern &s;ky,</L>
<L>In ro&s;eat &s;plendor clos'd his circling cour&s;e,</L>
<L>And ting'd the clouds with many a varied dye,</L>
<L>When, following Fancy's ever-flowing &s;ource</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of cool poetic joy, I bent my way</L>
<L>Tow'rd a maje&s;tic Ca&s;tle's ruins wide;</L>
<L>Within who&s;e gates once royalty bore &s;way,</L>
<L>And for a &s;ea&s;on laid its cares a&s;ide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The bleating flocks were pent within the fold;</L>
<L>The jovial reapers long had left the vale;</L>
<L>The plowman at his cheary fire-&s;ide told</L>
<L>The merry &s;tory, or the mournful tale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<L>Now SOL had gone to other worlds to ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And all the place to &s;ilence was re&s;ign'd;</L>
<L>While on the ruin fixed were my eyes,</L>
<L>A plea&s;ing melancholy fill'd my mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Comparing pre&s;ent things with pa&s;t, a tear</L>
<L>Starting from either eye down gently &s;tole;</L>
<L>Tho' from my heart wrung by reflection drear,</L>
<L>A tear which pity wi&s;h'd not to control!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While yielding thus to lenient grief, I deem'd</L>
<L>A ru&s;hing noi&s;e I heard, and looking round,</L>
<L>A &s;udden light effulgent on me beam'd,</L>
<L>And all my &s;oul in admiration bound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Upon the hill de&s;cended from on high,</L>
<L>A BEING far tran&s;cending human kind:</L>
<L>I gaz'd upon him as he glided nigh,</L>
<L>His form engaging all my pen&s;ive mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>An azure robe, of a cele&s;tial dye,</L>
<L>Around him wildly wanton'd in the breeze:</L>
<L>Bare were his feet; his looks did &s;eem to vye</L>
<L>With new-fall'n &s;now that tips the aged trees.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Placid and mild his look, yet con&s;cious &s;eem'd</L>
<L>Of maje&s;ty, and piercing was his eye,</L>
<L>That fla&s;hing with a heav'nly ardor gleam'd,</L>
<L>As form'd with ea&s;e to &s;can earth, &s;ea, and &s;ky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<L>His decent foot&s;tops with a &s;ilver wand</L>
<L>Were guided, as maje&s;tically &s;low</L>
<L>Tow'rd me he calm advanc'd, and took his &s;tand</L>
<L>Be&s;ide me, lo&s;t in Pity's balmy woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"AH, mortal! (&s;aid he) thou art mov'd in vain</L>
<L>"To &s;ee all human grandeur yield to Fate,</L>
<L>"When from its fall thou &s;hould&s;t e&s;&s;ay to gain</L>
<L>"In&s;truction, not bewail its fallen &s;tate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"'Tis my delight, at fall of dewy eve,</L>
<L>"To vi&s;it and conver&s;e with mortals good,</L>
<L>"My heav'nly dictates who with joy receive</L>

<L>"The vain magnificence of man may prove</L>

<L>Of CONTEMPLATION, radiant &s;on of Truth;</L>
<L>When empty joys invite, or &s;orrows lowr,</L>
<L>The comforter of age, the guide of youth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For often he my lone &s;eque&s;ter'd cot</L>
<L>Had deign'd to vi&s;it, where he taught my &s;oul</L>
