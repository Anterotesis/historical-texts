<HEAD>LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE ADDRESSERS, ON THE LATE <HI>PROCLAMATION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>COULD I have commanded circum&s;tances with a wi&s;h, I know not of any that would have more generally promoted the progre&s;s of knowledge, than the late Proclamation, and the numerous rotten Borough and Corporation Ad|dre&s;&s;es thereon. They have not only &s;erved as adverti&s;ements, but they have excited a &s;pirit of enquiry into principles of government, and a de|&s;ire to read the RIGHTS OF MAN, in places, where that &s;pirit and that work were before un|known.</P>
<P>The people of England, wearied and &s;tunned with parties, and alternately deceived by each, had almo&s;t re&s;igned the prerogative of thinking. Even curio&s;ity had expired, and a univer&s;al langour had &s;pread it&s;elf over the land. The oppo&s;ition
<PB N="4" REF="4">was vi&s;ibly no other that a conte&s;t for power, whil&s;t the ma&s;s of the nation &s;tood torpidly by as the prize.</P>
<P>In this hopele&s;s &s;tate of things, the Fir&s;t Part of RIGHT OF MAN made its appearance. It had to combat with a &s;trange mixture of prejudice and indifference; it &s;tood expo&s;ed to every &s;pecies of new&s;paper abu&s;e; and be&s;ides this, it had to remove the ob&s;tructions which Mr. Burke's rude and out|rageous attack on the French Revolution had art|fully rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>But how ea&s;ily does even the mo&s;t illiterate reader di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;pontaneous &s;en&s;ations of the heart, from the laboured productions of the brain. Truth, whenever it can fully appear, is a thing &s;o naturally familiar to the mind, that an acquaintance commences at fir&s;t &s;ight. No ar|tificial light, yet di&s;covered, can di&s;play all the properties of day-light; &s;o neither can the be&s;t invented fiction fill the mind with every con|viction which truth begets.</P>
<P>To overthrow Mr. Burke's fallacious work was &s;carcely the operation of a day. Even the pha|lanx of Placemen and Pen&s;ioners, who had given the tone to the multitude, by clamouring forth his political fame, became &s;uddenly &s;ilent; and the final event to him&s;elf has been, that as he ro&s;e like a rocket, he fell like the &s;tick.</P>
<P>It &s;eldom happens, that the mind re&s;ts &s;atisfied with the &s;imple detection of error or impo&s;ition.&mdash; Once put into motion, <HI>that</HI> motion &s;oon becomes
<PB N="5" REF="5">accelerated: where it had intended to &s;top, it di&s;covers new rea&s;ons to proceed, and renews and continues the pur&s;uit far beyond the limits it fir&s;t pre&s;cribed to it&s;elf.&mdash;Thus it has happened to the people of England. From a detection of Mr. Burke's incoherent rhap&s;odies, and di&s;torted facts, they began an enquiry into fir&s;t principles of Go|vernment, whil&s;t him&s;elf, like an object left far behind, became invi&s;ible and forgotten.</P>
<P>Much as the Fir&s;t Part of RIGHTS OF MAN impre&s;&s;ed at its fir&s;t appearance, the progre&s;&s;ive mind &s;oon di&s;covered that it did not go far enough. It detected errors; it expo&s;ed ab&s;urdities; it &s;hook the fabric of political &s;uper&s;tition; it generated new ideas; but it did not produce a regular &s;y&s;tem of principles in the room of tho&s;e which it di&s;|placed. And, if I may gue&s;s at the mind of the Government-party, they beheld it as an unexpected gale that would &s;oon blow over, and they forbore, like &s;ailors in threatening weather, to whi&s;tle, le&s;t they &s;hould encrea&s;e the wind. Every thing, on their part, was profound &s;ilence.</P>
<P>When the Second Part of <Q>RIGHTS OF MAN, <HI>combining Principle and Practice,</HI></Q> was prepar|ing to appear, they affected, for a while, to act with the &s;ame policy as before; but finding their &s;ilence had no more influence in &s;tilling the pro|gre&s;s of the work, than it would have in &s;topping the progre&s;s of time, they changed their plan, and affected to treat it with clamorous contempt. The Speech-making Placemen and Pen&s;ioners,
<PB N="6" REF="6">and Place-expectants, in both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment, the <HI>Outs</HI> as well as the <HI>Ins,</HI> repre&s;ented it as a &s;illy, in&s;ignificant performance; as a work in|capable of producing any effect; as &s;omething, which they were &s;ure the good &s;en&s;e of the people would either de&s;pi&s;e or indignantly &s;purn; but &s;uch was the over&s;trained awkwardne&s;s with which they harangued and encouraged each other, that in the very act of declaring their confidence they betrayed their fears.</P>
<P>As mo&s;t of the rotten Borough Addre&s;&s;ers are ob&s;cured in holes and corners throughout the country, and to whom a new&s;paper arrives as rarely as an almanac, they mo&s;t probably have not had the opportunity of knowing how this part of the farce (the original prelude to all the Addre&s;&s;es) has been acted. For <HI>their</HI> information, I will &s;u&s;pend a while the more &s;erious purpo&s;e of my Letter, and entertain them with two or three Speeches in the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, which will &s;erve them for politics till Parliament meets again.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, Gentlemen, that the Second Part of RIGHTS OF MAN, (the book again&s;t which you have been pre&s;enting Addre&s;&s;es, though, it is mo&s;t probable, that many of you did not know it) was to have come out preci&s;ely at the time that Par|liament la&s;t met. It happened not to be publi&s;hed till a few days after. But as it was very well known that the book would &s;hortly appear, the parliamen|tary Orators entered into a very cordial coalition to
<PB N="7" REF="7">cry the book down, and they began their attack by crying up the <HI>ble&s;&s;ings</HI> of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Had it been your fate to have been there, you could not but have been moved at the heart-and-pockets-felt congratulations that pa&s;&s;ed between all the parties on this &s;ubject of <HI>ble&s;&s;ings;</HI> for the <HI>Outs</HI> enjoy places and pen&s;ions and &s;inecures as well as the <HI>Ins,</HI> and are as devoutly attached to the firm of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t con&s;picuous of this motley groupe is the Clerk of the Court of King's Bench, who calls him&s;elf Lord Stormont. He is al&s;o called Ju&s;tice General of Scotland, and Keeper of Scoon (an oppo&s;ition man) and he draws from the public for the&s;e nominal offices, not le&s;s, as I am informed, than &s;ix thou&s;and pounds a year, and he is, mo&s;t probably, at the trouble of count|ing the money, and &s;igning a receipt, to &s;hew, per|haps, that he is qualified to be Clerk as well as Ju&s;tice. He &s;poke as follows: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Speech in the Morning Chronicle of Feb. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>THAT <HI>we</HI> &s;hall <HI>all</HI> be unanimous, in ex|pre&s;&s;ing <HI>our</HI> attachment to the con&s;titution of the&s;e realms <HI>I am confident.</HI> It is a &s;ubject upon which there can be <HI>no</HI> divided opinion in <HI>this hou&s;e.</HI> I do not pretend to be deep read in the knowledge of the Con&s;titution, but <HI>I take upon me</HI> to &s;ay, that from the extent of <HI>my</HI> knowledge <HI>(for I have &s;o many thou&s;ands a year for nothing)</HI> it appears to <HI>me,</HI> that from the period of the Revolution, for it was
<PB N="8" REF="8">by no means created then, it has been, both in <HI>theory</HI> and <HI>practice,</HI> the <HI>wi&s;e&s;t</HI> &s;y&s;tem that ever was formed. I never was (he means he never was <HI>till now</HI>) a dealer in <HI>political cant.</HI> My life has not been occupied in <HI>that way,</HI> but the &s;pecu|lations of late years <HI>&s;eem to have taken a turn, for which I cannot account.</HI> When I came into public life, the political pamphlets of the time, however they might be charged with the heat and violence of parties, were agreed in ex|tolling the radical beauties of the Con&s;titution it&s;elf. I remember <HI>(he means he has for|gotton)</HI> a mo&s;t captivating eulogium on its <HI>charms</HI> by Lord Bolingbroke, where he re|commends his readers to contemplate it in all its a&s;pects, with the a&s;&s;urance that it would be found more e&s;timable the more it was <HI>&s;een.</HI> I do <HI>not recollect</HI> his preci&s;e words, but I wi&s;h that men who write upon the&s;e &s;ub|jects would take <HI>this for their model,</HI> in&s;tead of the political pamphlets, which I am told, are now in circulation, (&s;uch, I &s;uppo&s;e, as <HI>Rights of Man</HI>)&mdash;pamphlets which I have <HI>not read,</HI> and who&s;e purport I know only by <HI>report,</HI> (he means, perhaps, by the <HI>noi&s;e</HI> they make.) This, however, I am &s;ure, that pamphlets tending to un&s;ettle the public reverence for the <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> will have very little influence. They can do very little harm &mdash;for <HI>(by the bye, he is no dealer in political cant) the Engli&s;h are a &s;ober-thinking people, and are more intelligent, more &s;olid, more &s;teady in their
<PB N="9" REF="9">opinions, than any people I ever had the fortune to &s;ee.</HI> (This is pretty well laid on, though, for a new beginner.) But if there &s;hould ever come a time when the propagation of tho&s;e doctrines &s;hould agitate the public mind, I am <HI>&s;ure,</HI> for <HI>every one</HI> of your Lord&s;hips. that no attack will be made on the con&s;titution, from which it is <HI>truly &s;aid</HI> that <HI>we</HI> derive <HI>all our</HI> pro&s;perity, with|out rai&s;ing <HI>every one</HI> of your Lord&s;hips to its &s;upport. It will then be found that there is no difference among <HI>us,</HI> but that <HI>we</HI> are <HI>all</HI> deter|mined to <HI>&s;tand</HI> or <HI>fall</HI> together, in defence of the ine&s;timable &s;y&s;tem</Q>&mdash;of places and pen&s;ions.</P>
<P>After Stormont, on the oppo&s;ition &s;ide, &s;at down, up ro&s;e <HI>another noble Lord!</HI> on the mini&s;te|rial &s;ide, <HI>Grenville.</HI> This man ought to be as &s;trong in the back as a mule, or the <HI>&s;ire</HI> of a mule, or it would crack with the weight of places and offices. He ro&s;e, however, without feeling any in|cumbrance, full ma&s;ter of his weight; and thus &s;aid <HI>this</HI> noble Lord to <HI>t'other</HI> noble Lord!</P>
<P><Q>The <HI>patriotic</HI> and <HI>manly</HI> manner in which the noble Lord has declared <HI>his</HI> &s;entiments on the &s;ubject of the con&s;titution, demands <HI>my cordial</HI> approbation. The noble Vi&s;count has <HI>proved,</HI> that however we may differ on <HI>par|ticular mea&s;ures,</HI> amid&s;t all the jars and di&s;|&s;onance of <HI>parties,</HI> we are unanimous in <HI>princi|ple.</HI> There is a <HI>perfect</HI> and <HI>entire con&s;ent</HI> (be|tween <HI>us</HI>) in the love and maintenance of the con&s;titution as <HI>happily &s;ub&s;i&s;ting.</HI> It mu&s;t <HI>un|doubtedly</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="10">give your Lord&s;hips <HI>concern,</HI> to find, that the <HI>time is come!</HI> (heigh ho!) when there is <HI>propriety</HI> in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of regard TO (O! O! O!) THE CONSTITUTION. And that there are men (confound&mdash;their&mdash;po-li-tics) who di&s;|&s;eminate doctrines <HI>ho&s;tile</HI> to the <HI>genuine &s;pirit</HI> of our <HI>well balanced &s;y&s;tem,</HI> (it is certainly well balanced when both &s;ides hold places and pen&s;ions at once.) I agree with the noble Vi&s;|count that they have not (I hope) <HI>much &s;ucce&s;s.</HI> I am convinced that there is no danger to be apprehended from their attempts: but it is <HI>truly</HI> important and <HI>con&s;olatary</HI> (to us place-men, I &s;up|po&s;e) to know, that if there &s;hould ever ari&s;e a &s;erious alarm, there is but one <HI>&s;pirit, one &s;en&s;e,</HI> (and that &s;en&s;e I pre&s;ume is not <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI>) and <HI>one</HI> determination in <HI>this</HI> hou&s;e.</Q>&mdash;which un|doubtedly is to hold all their places and pen&s;ions as long as they can.</P>
<P>Both tho&s;e &s;peeches (excepting the parts en|clo&s;ed in parenthe&s;es, which are added for the pur|po&s;e of <HI>illu&s;tration</HI>) are copied <HI>verbatim</HI> from the Morning Chronicle of the 1&s;t of February la&s;t; and when the &s;ituation of the &s;peakers is con&s;ider|ed, the one in the oppo&s;ition, and the other in the mini&s;try, and both of them living at the public ex|pence, by &s;inecure, or nominal places and offices, it required a very unblu&s;hing front to be able to deliver them. Can tho&s;e men &s;eriou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;e any nation to be &s;o completely blind as not to &s;ee through them? Can Stormont imagine that the
<PB N="11" REF="11"><HI>political cant,</HI> with which he has larded his ha|rangue, will conceal the craft? Does he not know that there never was a cover large enough to hide <HI>it&s;elf?</HI> Or can Grenville believe, that his credit with the public encrea&s;es with his avarice for places?</P>
<P>But, if the&s;e orators will accept a &s;ervice from me, in return for the allu&s;ions they have made to the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> I will make a &s;peech for either of them to deliver on the excellence of the con&s;ti|tution, that &s;hall be as much to the purpo&s;e as what they have &s;poken, or as <HI>Bolingbroke's capti|vating encomium.</HI> Here it is.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>THAT we &s;hall all be unanimous in expre&s;&s;ing our attachment to the con&s;titution, I am confi|dent. It is, my Lords, incomprehen&s;ibly good: but the great wonder of all is the wi&s;dom; for it is, my Lords, <HI>the wi&s;e&s;t &s;y&s;tem that ever was formed.</HI></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to us noble Lords, though the world does not know it, it is very well known to us, that we have more wi&s;dom than we know what to do with; and what is &s;till better, my Lords, we have it all in &s;tock. I defy your Lord&s;hips to prove, that a tittle of it has been u&s;ed yet; and if we do but go on, my Lords, with the frugality we have hitherto done, we &s;hall leave to our heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, when we go out of the world, the whole &s;tock of wi&s;dom, <HI>untouched,</HI> that we brought in; and there is no doubt but they will follow our example. This, my Lords, is one of the ble&s;&s;ed effects of the hereditary &s;y&s;tem; for we can never
<PB N="12" REF="12">be without wi&s;dom &s;o long as we keep it by us, and do not u&s;e it.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, as all this wi&s;dom is heredi|tary property, for the &s;ole benefit of us and our heirs, and as it is nece&s;&s;ary that the people &s;hould know where to get a &s;upply for their own u&s;e, the excellence of our con&s;titution has provided a King for this very purpo&s;e, and for <HI>no other.</HI> But, my Lords, I perceive a defect to which the con&s;ti|tution is &s;ubject, and which I propo&s;e to remedy by bringing a bill into Parliament for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution, my Lords, out of delicacy, I pre&s;ume, has left it as a matter of <HI>choice</HI> to a King whether he will be wi&s;e or not. It has not, I mean, my Lords, in&s;i&s;ted upon it as a con&s;titu|tional point, which, I conceive, it ought to have done; for I pledge my&s;elf to your Lord&s;hips to prove, and that with <HI>true patriotic boldne&s;s,</HI> that he has <HI>no choice in the matter.</HI> The bill, my Lords, that I &s;hall bring in will be to declare, that the con&s;titution, according to the true intent and mean|ing thereof, does not inve&s;t the King with this choice; our ance&s;tors were too wi&s;e to do that; and, in order to prevent any doubts that might otherwi&s;e ari&s;e, I &s;hall prepare, my Lords, an enact|ing clau&s;e, to fix the wi&s;dom of Kings, by act of Parliament; and then, my Lords, our Con&s;titution will be the wonder of the world!</P>
<P>Wi&s;dom, my Lords, is the one thing needful; but that there may be no mi&s;take in this matter,
<PB N="13" REF="13">and that we may proceed con&s;i&s;tently with the true wi&s;dom of the con&s;titution, I &s;hall propo&s;e a <HI>certain criterion,</HI> whereby the <HI>exact quantity of wi&s;dom</HI> ne|ce&s;&s;ary for a King may be known. [Here &s;hould be a cry of Hear him! Hear him!]</P>
<P>It is recorded, my Lords, in the Statutes at Large of the Jews, <Q>a book, my Lords, which I have not read, and who&s;e purport I know only by report,</Q> <HI>but perhaps the bench of Bi&s;hops can recollect &s;omething about it,</HI> that Saul gave the mo&s;t convincing proofs of royal wi&s;dom before he was made a King, <HI>for he was &s;ent to &s;eek his father's a&s;&s;es, and he could not find them.</HI></P>
<P>Here, my Lords, we have, mo&s;t happily for us, a ca&s;e in point: This precedent ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of Parliament; and every King, before he be crowned, &s;hould be &s;ent to &s;eek his father's a&s;&s;es, and if he cannot find them, he &s;hall be declared wi&s;e enough to be King, according to the true meaning of our excellent con&s;titution. All, therefore, my Lords, that will be nece&s;&s;ary to be done, by the enacting clau&s;e that I &s;hall bring in, will be to inve&s;t the King before-hand with the quantity of wi&s;dom nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e, le&s;t he &s;hould happen not to po&s;&s;e&s;s it; and this, my Lords, we can do without making u&s;e of any of our own.</P>
<P>We further read, my Lords, in the &s;aid Statutes at Large of the Jews, that Samuel, who certainly was as mad as any Man-of-Rights-Man now a-days,
<PB N="14" REF="14">(hear him! hear him!) was highly di&s;plea&s;ed, and even exa&s;perated, at the propo&s;al of the Jews to have a King, and he warned them again&s;t it with all that a&s;&s;urance and impudence of which he was ma&s;ter. I have been, my Lords, at the trouble of going all the way to <HI>Paterno&s;ter-row,</HI> to procure an extract from the printed copy. I was told that I &s;hould meet with it there, or in <HI>Amen-corner,</HI> for I was then going, my Lords, to rummage for it among the curio&s;ities of the <HI>Antiquarian Society.</HI>&mdash;I will read the extract to your Lord&s;hips, to &s;hew how little Samuel knew of the matter.</P>
<P>The extract, my Lords, is from 1 <HI>Samuel,</HI> chap. 8.</P>
<Q><P>And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people, that a&s;ked of him a King.</P>
<P>And he &s;aid, this will be the manner of the King that &s;hall reign over you: he will take your &s;ons, and appoint them for him&s;elf, for his chariots, and to be his hor&s;emen; and &s;ome &s;hall run before his chariots.</P>
<P>And he will appoint him captains over thou|&s;ands, and captains over fifties, and will &s;et them to ear his ground, and to reap his harve&s;t, and to make his in&s;truments of war, and in&s;truments of his chariots.</P>
<P>And he will take your daughters to be confec|tionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.</P>
<P>And he will take your fields, and your vine|yards, and your olive-yards, even the be&s;t of them, and give them to his &s;ervants.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15">And he will take tenth of your &s;eed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his &s;ervants.</P>
<P>And he will take your men-&s;ervants, and your maid-&s;ervants, and your goodlie&s;t young men, and your a&s;&s;es, and put them to his work.</P>
<P>And he will take the tenth of your &s;heep, and ye &s;hall be his &s;ervants.</P>
<P>And ye &s;hall cry out in that day, becau&s;e of your King, which ye &s;hall have cho&s;en you; and the Lord will not hear you on that day.</P></Q>
<P>Now, my Lords, what can we think of this man Samuel? Is there a word of truth, or any thing like truth, in all that he has &s;aid? He pre|tended to be a prophet, or a wi&s;e man, but has not the event proved him to be a fool, or an incen|diary? Look around, my Lords, and &s;ee if any thing has happened that he pretended to foretell? Has not the mo&s;t profound peace reigned through|out the world ever &s;ince Kings were in fa&s;hion? Are not, for example, the pre&s;ent Kings of Europe the mo&s;t peaceable of mankind, and the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia the very milk of human kindne&s;s? It would not be worth having Kings, my Lords, if it were not that they never go to war.</P>
<P>If we look at home, my Lords, do we not &s;ee the &s;ame things here as are &s;een every where el&s;e? Are our young men taken to be hor&s;emen, or foot &s;oldiers, any more than in Germany or in Pru&s;&s;ia, or in Hanover or in He&s;&s;e? Are not our &s;ailors as &s;afe at land as at &s;ea? Are they ever dragged from
<PB N="16" REF="16">their homes, like oxen to the &s;laughter-hou&s;e, to &s;erve on board &s;hips of war? When they return from the perils of long voyage with the merchan|dize of di&s;tant countries, does not every man &s;it down under his own vine and his own fig-tree, in perfect &s;ecurity? Is the tenth of our &s;eed taken by tax-gatherers, or is any part of it given to the King's &s;ervants? In &s;hort, <HI>is not every thing as free from taxes as the light from Heaven!</HI></P>
<P>Ah! my Lords, do we not &s;ee the ble&s;&s;ed effect of having Kings in every thing we look at? Is not the G. R. or the broad R. &s;tampt upon every thing? Even the &s;hoes, the gloves, and the hats that we wear, are enriched with the impre&s;&s;ion, and all our candles blaze a burnt-offering.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, my Lords, that cover us from the &s;ole of the foot to the crown of the head, do we not &s;ee a race of youths growing up to be Kings, who are the very paragons of virtue? There is not one of them, my Lords, but might be tru&s;ted with untold gold, as &s;afely as the other. Are they not <Q><HI>more &s;ober, more intelligent, more &s;o|lid, more &s;teady,</HI></Q> and withall, more learned, more wi&s;e, more every thing, than any youths <HI>we <Q>ever had the fortune to &s;ee.</Q></HI> Ah! my Lords, they are a <HI>hopeful family.</HI></P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;ed pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which the nation has at this moment before its eyes, is a mo&s;t undeniable proof of the excellence of our con&s;titution, and of the ble&s;&s;ed hereditary &s;y&s;tem; for nothing, my Lords, but a con&s;titution founded
<PB N="17" REF="17">on the true&s;t and pure&s;t wi&s;dom, could admit &s;uch heaven-born and heaven-taught characters into the government.&mdash;Permit me now, my Lords, to recal your attention to the libellous chapter I have ju&s;t read about Kings. I mention this, my Lords, be|cau&s;e it is my intention to move for a bill to be brought into Parliament to expunge that chapter from the Bible, and that the Lord Chancellor, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Prince of Wales, the Duke of York, and the Duke of Clarence, be reque&s;ted to write a chapter in the room of it; and that Mr. Burke do &s;ee that it be truly canonical, and faith|fully in&s;erted.'&mdash;FINIS.</P></Q>
<P>If the Clerk of the Court of King's Bench &s;hould chu&s;e to be the orator of this luminous en|comium on the con&s;titution, I hope he will get it well by heart before he attempt to deliver it, and not to have to apologize to Parliament, as he did in the ca&s;e of Bolingbroke's encomium, for for|getting his le&s;&s;on; and, with this admonition, I leave him.</P>
<P>Having thus informed the Addre&s;&s;ers of what pa&s;&s;ed at the meeting of Parliament, I return to take up the &s;ubject at the part where I broke off in order to introduce the preceding &s;peeches.</P>
<P>I was then &s;tating, that the fir&s;t policy of the Government party was &s;ilence, and the next, cla|morous contempt; but as people generally choo&s;e to read and judge for them&s;elves, the work &s;till went on, and the affectation of contempt, like the &s;ilence that preceded it, pa&s;&s;ed for nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="18">Thus foiled in their &s;econd &s;cheme, their evil genius, like a will-with-a-wi&s;p, led them to a third; when all at once, as if it had been unfolded to them by a fortune-teller, or Mr. Dundas had di&s;covered it by &s;econd &s;ight, this once harmle&s;s, in&s;ignificant book, without undergoing the altera|tion of a &s;ingle letter, became a mo&s;t wicked and dangerous Libel. The whole Cabinet, like a &s;hip's crew, became alarmed; all hands were piped upon deck, as if a con&s;piracy of elements was forming around them, and out came the Proclamation and the Pro&s;ecution; and Addre&s;&s;es &s;upplied the place of prayers.</P>
<P>Ye &s;illy &s;wains, thought I to my&s;elf, why do you torment your&s;elves thus? The RIGHTS OF MAN is a book calmy and rationally written; why then are you &s;o di&s;turbed? Did you &s;ee how little or how &s;u&s;picious &s;uch conduct makes you appear, even cunning alone, had you no other faculty, would hu&s;h you into prudence. The plans, principles, and arguments, contained in that work, are placed before the eyes of the nation, and of the world, in a fair, open, and manly manner, and nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary than to refute them. Do this, and the whole is done; but if ye cannot, &s;o neither can ye &s;upre&s;s the reading, nor convict the Author; for that Law, in the opinion of all good men, would convict it&s;elf, that &s;hould condemn what cannot be refuted.</P>
<P>Having now &s;hewn the Addre&s;&s;ers the &s;everal &s;tages of the bu&s;ine&s;s, prior to their being called
<PB N="19" REF="19">upon, like Cae&s;ar in the Tyber, crying to Ca&s;&s;ius, <HI>"help, Ca&s;&s;ius, or I &s;ink!"</HI> I next come to remark on the policy of the Government, in promoting Addre&s;&s;es; on the con&s;equences naturally re&s;ulting therefrom; and on the conduct of the per&s;ons con|cerned.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the policy, it evidently carries with it every mark and feature of di&s;gui&s;ed fear. And it will hereafter be placed in the hi&s;tory of extraordinary things, that a pamphlet &s;hould be produced by an individual, unconnected with any &s;ect or party, and not &s;eeking to make any, and almo&s;t a &s;tranger in the land, that &s;hould com|pleatly frighten a whole Government, and that in the mid&s;t of its mo&s;t triumphant &s;ecurity. Such a circum&s;tance cannot fail to prove, that either the pamphlet has irre&s;i&s;tible powers, or the Govern|ment very extraordinary defects, or both. The Nation exhibits no &s;igns of fear at the Rights of Man; why then &s;hould the Government, unle&s;s the intere&s;t of the two are really oppo&s;ite to each other, and the &s;ecret is beginning to be known? That there are two di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es of men in the nation, tho&s;e who pay taxes, and tho&s;e who receive and live upon the taxes, is evident at fir&s;t &s;ight; and when taxation is carried to exce&s;s, it cannot fail to di&s;unite tho&s;e two, and &s;omething of this kind is now beginning to appear.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o curious to ob&s;erve, amid&s;t all the fume and bu&s;tle about Proclamations and Addre&s;&s;es, kept up by a few noi&s;y and intere&s;ted men, how
<PB N="20" REF="20">little the ma&s;s of the nation &s;eem to care about either. They appear to me, by the indifference they &s;hew, not to believe a word the Proclamation contains; and as to the Addre&s;&s;es, they travel to London with the &s;ilence of a funeral, and having announced their arrival in the Gazette, are depo|&s;ited with a&s;hes of their predece&s;&s;ors, and Mr. Dundas writes their <HI>hic jacet.</HI></P>
<P>One of the be&s;t effects which the Proclamation, and its echo the Addre&s;&s;es have had, has been that of exciting and &s;preading curio&s;ity; and it re|quires only a &s;ingle reflection to di&s;cover, that the object of all curio&s;ity is knowledge. When the ma&s;s of the nation &s;aw that Placemen, Ben&s;ioners, and Borough-mongers, were the per&s;ons that &s;tood forward to promote Addre&s;&s;es, it could not fail to create &s;u&s;picious that the public good was not their object; that the character of the books, or writings, to which &s;uch per&s;ons ob&s;curely alluded, not daring to mention them, was directly contrary to what they de&s;cribed them to be, and that it was nece&s;&s;ary that every man, for his own &s;atisfaction, &s;hould exerci&s;e his proper right, and read and judge for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But how will the per&s;ons who have been in|duced to read the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> by the clamour that has been rai&s;ed again&s;t it, be &s;urprized to find, that, in&s;tead of a wicked, inflamatory work, in|&s;tead of a licencious and profligate performance, it abounds with principles of government that are uncontrovertible&mdash;with arguments which every
<PB N="21" REF="21">reader will feel, are unan&s;werable&mdash;with plans for the increa&s;e of commerce and manufactures&mdash;for the extinction of war&mdash;for the education of the children of the poor&mdash;for the comfortable &s;upport of the aged and decayed per&s;ons of both &s;exes&mdash; for the relief of the army and navy, and, in &s;hort, for the promotion of every thing that can benefit the moral, civil and political condition of Man.</P>
<P>Why, then, &s;ome calm ob&s;erver will a&s;k, why is the work pro&s;ecuted, if the&s;e be the goodly mat|ters it contains? I will tell thee, friend; it contains al&s;o a plan for the reduction of Taxes, for le&s;&s;ening the immen&s;e expences of Government, for abo|li&s;hing &s;inecure Places and Pen&s;ions; and it pro|po&s;es applying the redundant taxes, that &s;hall be &s;aved by the&s;e reforms, to the purpo&s;es men|tioned in the former paragraph, in&s;tead of apply|ing them to the &s;upport of idle and profligate Placemen and Pen&s;ioners.</P>
<P>Is it, then, any wonder that Placemen and Pen|&s;ioners, and the whole train of Court expectants, &s;hould become the promoters of Addre&s;&s;es, Pro|clamations, and Pro&s;ecutions? or, is it any wonder that Corporations and rotten Boroughs, which are attacked and expo&s;ed, both in the Fir&s;t and Se|cond Parts of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> as unju&s;t monopolies and public nui&s;ances, &s;hould join in the cavalcade? Yet the&s;e are the &s;ources from which Addre&s;&s;es have &s;prung. Had not &s;uch per&s;ons come for|ward to oppo&s;e the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> I &s;hould have doubted the efficacy of my own writings: but
<PB N="22" REF="22">tho&s;e oppo&s;ers have now proved to me, that the blow was well directed, and they have done it ju&s;tice, by confe&s;&s;ing the &s;mart.</P>
<P>The principal deception in this bu&s;ine&s;s of Ad|dre&s;&s;es has been, that the promoters of them have not come forward in their proper characters. They have a&s;&s;umed to pa&s;s them&s;elves upon the Public, as a part of the Public bearing a &s;hare of the bur|then of Taxes, and acting for the public good; whereas, they are in general that part of it that adds to the public burthen, by living on the pro|duce of the public taxes. They are to the pub|lic what the locu&s;ts are to the tree: the burthen would be le&s;s, and the pro&s;perity would be greater, if they were &s;haken off.</P>
<P>"I do not come here," &s;aid ONSLOW, at the Surry County meeting, <Q>as Lord Lieutenant and Cu&s;tos Rotulorum of the county, but I come here as a plain country gentleman.</Q> The fact is, that he came there as what he was, and as no other, and con&s;equently he came as one of the beings I have been de&s;cribing. If it be the cha|racter of a gentleman to be fed by the public, as a pauper is by the pari&s;h, On&s;low has a fair claim to the title; and the &s;ame de&s;cription will &s;uit the Duke of Richmond, who led the Addre&s;s at the Su&s;&s;ex meeting.&mdash;He al&s;o may &s;et up for a gen|tleman.</P>
<P>As to the meeting in the next adjoining county, (Kent) it was a &s;cene of di&s;grace. About two hundred per&s;ons met, when a &s;mall part of them
<PB N="23" REF="23">drew privately away from the re&s;t, and voted an Addre&s;s: the con&s;equence of which was, that they got together by the ears, and produced a riot in the very act of producing an Addre&s;s to prevent Riots.</P>
<P>That the Proclamation and the Addre&s;&s;es have failed of their intended effect, may be collected from the &s;ilence which the Government party it|&s;elf ob&s;erves. The number of Addre&s;&s;es has been weekly retailed in the Gazette; but the number of Addre&s;&s;ers has been concealed. Several of the Addre&s;&s;es have been voted by not more than ten or twelve per&s;ons; and a con&s;iderable number of them by not more than thirty. The whole num|ber of Addre&s;&s;es pre&s;ented at the time of writing this letter is three hundred and twenty, (rotten Boroughs and Corporations included) and even admitting, on an average, one hundred Addre&s;&s;ers to each Addre&s;s, the whole number of Addre&s;&s;ers would be but thirty-two thou&s;and, and nearly three months have been taken up in procuring this num|ber. That the &s;ucce&s;s of the Proclamation has been le&s;s than the &s;ucce&s;s of the Work it was in|tended to di&s;courage, is a matter within my own knowledge; for a greater number of the cheap edition of the Fir&s;t and &s;econd Parts of RIGHT OF MAN has been &s;old in the &s;pace only of one month, than the whole number of Addre&s;&s;ers (admitting them to be thirty-two thou&s;and) have amounted to in three months.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="24">It is a dangerous attempt in any Government to &s;ay to a Nation, <HI>"thou &s;halt not read."</HI> This is now done in Spain, and was formerly done under the old Government of France; but it &s;erved to procure the downfal of the latter, and is &s;ubverting that of the former; and it will have the &s;ame ten|dency in all countries; because <HI>thought,</HI> by &s;ome means or other, is got abroad in the world, and cannot be re&s;trained, though reading may.</P>
<P>If <HI>Rights of Man</HI> were a book that de&s;erved the vile de&s;cription which the promoters of the Ad|dre&s;s have given of it, why did not the&s;e men prove their charge, and &s;atisfy the people, by pro|ducing it, and reading it publicly? This mo&s;t certainly ought to have been done, and would al&s;o have been done, had they believed it would have an&s;wered their purpo&s;e. But the fact is, that the book contains truths, which tho&s;e time-&s;ervers dreaded to hear, and dreaded that the people &s;hould know; and it is now following up the Ad|dre&s;&s;es in every part of the nation, and convicting them of fal&s;hoods.</P>
<P>Among the unwarrantable proceedings to which the Proclamation has given ri&s;e, the meetings of the Ju&s;tices in &s;everal of the towns and counties ought to be noticed. Tho&s;e men have a&s;&s;umed to re-act the farce of General Warrants, and to &s;uppre&s;s, by their own authority, whatever publi|cations they plea&s;e. This is an attempt at power, equalled only by the conduct of the minor de&s;pots
<PB N="25" REF="25">of the mo&s;t de&s;potic governments in Europe, and yet tho&s;e Ju&s;tices affect to call England a Free Country. But even this, perhaps, like the &s;cheme for garri&s;oning the country, by building military barracks, is nece&s;&s;ary to awaken the country to a &s;en&s;e of its Rights, and, as &s;uch, it will have a good effect.</P>
<P>Another part of the conduct of &s;uch Ju&s;tices has been, that of threatening to take away the li|cences from taverns and public-hou&s;es, where the inhabitants of the neighbourhood a&s;&s;ociated to read and di&s;cu&s;s the principles of Government, and to inform each other thereon. This, again, is &s;imiliar to what is doing in Spain and Ru&s;&s;ia; and the reflection which it cannot fail to &s;ugge&s;t is, that the principles and conduct of any Govern|ment mu&s;t be bad, when that Government dreads and &s;tartles at di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and &s;eeks &s;ecurity by a prevention of knowledge.</P>
<P>If the Government, or the Con&s;titution, or by whatever name it be called, be that miracle of per|fection which the Proclamation and the Addre&s;&s;es have trumpeted it forth to be, it ought to have defied di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and inve&s;tigation, in&s;tead of dreading it. Whereas, every attempt it makes, either by Proclamation, Pro&s;ecution, or Addre&s;s, to &s;uppre&s;s inve&s;tigation, is a confe&s;&s;ion that it feels it&s;elf unable to bear it. It is error only, and not truth, that &s;hrinks from enquiry. All the numerous pamphlets, and all the new&s;paper fal&s;hood and abu&s;e, that have been publi&s;hed
<PB N="26" REF="26">again&s;t the "RIGHTS OF MAN," have fallen before it like pointle&s;s arrows; and, in like manner, would any work have fallen before the Con&s;titution, had the Con&s;titution, as it is called, been founded on as good political principles as tho&s;e on which the RIGHTS OF MAN is written.</P>
<P>It is a good Con&s;titution for courtiers, placeman, pen&s;ioners, borough-holders, and the leaders of Parties, and the&s;e are the men that have been the active leaders of Addre&s;&s;es; but it is a bad Con&s;titution for at lea&s;t ninety-nine parts of the nation out of an hundred, and this truth is every day making its way.</P>
<P>It is bad, fir&s;t, because it entails upon the nation the unnece&s;&s;ary expence of &s;upporting three forms and &s;y&s;tems of Government at once, namely, the monarchical, the ari&s;tocratical, and the democra|tical.</P>
<P>Secondly, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to unite &s;uch a di&s;cordant compo&s;ition by any other means than perpetual corruption; and therefore the corruption &s;o loudly and &s;o univer&s;ally complained of, is no other than the natural con&s;equence of &s;uch an unnatural compound of Governments; and in this con&s;i&s;ts that excellence which the numerous herd of placemen and pen&s;ioners &s;o loudly extol, and which, at the &s;ame time, occa&s;ions that enormous load of taxes under which the re&s;t of the nation groans.</P>
<P>Among the ma&s;s of national delu&s;ions calculat|ed to amu&s;e and impo&s;e upon the multitude, the
<PB N="27" REF="27">&s;tanding one has been, that of flattering them into taxes, by calling the Government, (or as they plea&s;e to expre&s;s it, the Engli&s;h con&s;titution) <Q><HI>the envy and the admiration of the world.</HI></Q> Scarcely an Addre&s;s has been voted in which &s;ome of the &s;peakers have not uttered this hackneyed non|&s;en&s;ical fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>Two Revolutions have taken place, tho&s;e of America and France; and both of them have re|jected the unnatural compounded &s;y&s;tem of the Engli&s;h government. America has declared again&s;t all hereditary Government, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the re|pre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem of Government only. France has entirely rejected the ari&s;tocratical part, and is now di&s;covering the ab&s;urdity of the monarchical, and is approaching fa&s;t to the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem. On what ground, then, do tho&s;e men con|tinue a declaration, re&s;pecting what they call the <HI>envy and admiration of other nations,</HI> which the voluntary practice of &s;uch nations, as have had the opportunity of e&s;tabli&s;hing Government, contra|dicts and fal&s;ifies. Will &s;uch men never confine them&s;elves to truth? Will they be for ever the de|ceivers of the people?</P>
<P>But I will go farther, and &s;hew, that, were Go|vernment now to begin in England, the people could not be brought to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem they now &s;ubmit to.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking upon this &s;ubject (or on any other) <HI>on the pure ground of principle,</HI> antiquity and pre|cedent
<PB N="28" REF="28">cea&s;e to be authority, and hoary-headed error lo&s;es its effect. The rea&s;onablene&s;s and propriety of things mu&s;t be examined ab&s;tractedly from cu&s;tom and u&s;age; and in this point of view, the right which grows into practice to-day is as much a right, and as old in principle and theory, as if it had the cu&s;tomary &s;anction of a thou&s;and ages. Principles have no connection with time, nor characters with names.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that the Government of this country is compo&s;ed of King, Lords, and Commons, is the mere phra&s;eology of cu&s;tom. It is compo&s;ed of men; and whoever the men be to whom the Go|vernment of any country is entru&s;ted, they ought to be the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t that can be found, and if they are not &s;o, they are not fit for the &s;tation. A man derives no more excellence from the change of a name, or calling him King, or calling him Lord, than I &s;hould do by changing my name from Thomas to George, or from Paine to Guelph, I &s;hould not be a whit the more able to write a book, becau&s;e my name were altered; neither would any man, now called a King or a Lord, have a whit the more &s;en&s;e than he now has, were he to call him&s;elf Thomas Paine.</P>
<P>As to the word "Commons," applied as it is in England, it is a term of degradation and re|proach, and ought to be aboli&s;hed. It is a term unknown in free countries.</P>
<P>But to the point.&mdash;Let us &s;uppo&s;e that Govern|ment was now to begin in England, and that the plan of Government, offered to the nation for its
<PB N="29" REF="29">approbation or rejection, con&s;i&s;ted of the following parts:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t&mdash;That &s;ome one individual &s;hould be taken from all the re&s;t of the nation, and to whom all the re&s;t &s;hould &s;wear obedience, and never be permitted to &s;it down in his pre&s;ence, and that they &s;hould give to him one million &s;terling a year.&mdash;That the nation &s;hould never after have power or authority to make laws but with his expre&s;s con&s;ent, and that his &s;ons and his &s;ons' &s;ons, whether wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, good men or bad, fit or unfit, &s;hould have the &s;ame power, and al&s;o the &s;ame money annually paid to them for ever.</P>
<P>Secondly&mdash;That there &s;hould be two hou&s;es of Legi&s;lators to a&s;&s;i&s;t in making laws, one of which &s;hould, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, be entirely appointed by the afore&s;aid per&s;on, and that their &s;ons and their &s;ons' &s;ons, whether wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, good men or bad, fit or unfit, &s;hould for ever after be hereditary Legi&s;lators.</P>
<P>Thirdly&mdash;That the other hou&s;e &s;hould be cho&s;en in the &s;ame manner as the hou&s;e, now called the Hou&s;e of Commons, is cho&s;en, and &s;hould be &s;ub|ject to the controul of the two afore&s;aid hereditary Powers in all things.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to cram &s;uch a farago of impo&s;ition and ab&s;urdity down the throat of this or any other nation, that were capable of rea&s;oning upon its rights and its intere&s;t.</P>
<P>They would a&s;k, in the fir&s;t place, on what ground of right, or on what principle, &s;uch ir|rational
<PB N="30" REF="30">and prepo&s;terous di&s;tinctions could, or ought to be made; and what preten&s;ions any man could have, or what &s;ervices he could render, to entitle him to a million a year? They would go farther, and revolt at the idea of con&s;igning their children, and their childrens' children, to the do|mination of per&s;ons hereafter to be born, who might, for any thing they could fore&s;ee, turn out to be knaves or fools; and they would finally di&s;cover, that the project of hereditary Governors and Legi&s;lators <HI>was a trea&s;onable u&s;urpation over the rights of po&s;terity.</HI> Not only the calm dictates of rea&s;on, and the force of natural affection, but the integrity of manly pride, would impel men to &s;purn &s;uch propo&s;als.</P>
<P>From the gro&s;&s;er ab&s;urdities of &s;uch a &s;cheme, they would extend their examination to the prac|tical defects&mdash;They would &s;oon &s;ee that it would end in tyranny accompli&s;hed by fraud. That in the operation of it, it would be two to one again&s;t them, becau&s;e the two parts that were to be made hereditary, would form a common intere&s;t, and &s;tick to each other; and that them&s;elves and their repre&s;entatives would become no better than hewers of wood and drawers of water for the other parts of the Government.&mdash;Yet call one of tho&s;e powers King, the other, Lords, and the third, the Com|mons, and it gives the model of what is called the Engli&s;h Government.</P>
<P>I have a&s;&s;erted, and have &s;hewn, both in the Fir&s;t and &s;econd Parts of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> that
<PB N="31" REF="31">there is not &s;uch a thing as an Engli&s;h Con&s;ti|tution, and that the people have yet a Con&s;ti|tution to form. <HI>A Con&s;titution is a thing ante|cedent to a Government; it is the act of the people creating a Government and giving it powers, and defining the limits and exerci&s;e of the powers &s;o given.</HI> But whenever did the people of England, acting in their original con&s;tituent character, by a delegation elected for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e, declare and &s;ay, <Q><HI>We, the people of this land, do con&s;titute and appoint this to be our &s;y&s;tem and form of Government.</HI></Q> The Government has a&s;&s;umed to con&s;titute it&s;elf, but it never was con&s;tituted by the people, in whom alone the right of con&s;tituting re&s;ides.</P>
<P>I will here recite the preamble to the Federal Con&s;titution of the United States of America. I have &s;hewn in the Second Part of <HI>rights of Man,</HI> the manner by which the Con&s;titution was formed and afterwards ratified; and to which I refer the reader.&mdash;The preamble is in the following words:
<Q>WE, THE PEOPLE of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, e&s;ta|bli&s;h ju&s;tice, in&s;ure dome&s;tic tranquillity, provide for common defence, promote the general welfare, &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings of li|berty to our&s;elves and our po&s;terity, DO OR|DAIN AND ESTABISH THIS CONSTITUTION for the United States of America.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="32">Then follow the &s;everal articles which appoint the manner in which the &s;everal component parts of the Government, legi&s;lative and executive, &s;hall be elected, and the period of their duration, and the powers they &s;hall have: al&s;o, the manner by which future additions, alterations, or amendments, &s;hall be made to the Con&s;titution. Con&s;equently, every improvement that can be made in the &s;cience of Government, follows in that country as a matter of order. It is only in Governments founded on a&s;&s;umption and fal&s;e principles, that rea&s;oning upon, and inve&s;tigating &s;y&s;tems and prin|ciples of Government, and &s;hewing their &s;everal excellencies and defects, are termed libellous and &s;editious. The&s;e terms were made part of the charge brought again&s;t Locke, Hampden, and Sydney, and will continue to be brought again&s;t all good men, &s;o long as had government &s;hall continue.</P>
<P>The Government of this country has been o&s;|tentatiou&s;ly giving challenges for more than an hundred years pa&s;t, upon what it called its own excellence and perfection. Scarcely a King's Speech, or a Parliamentary Speech, has been utter|ed, in which this glove has not been thrown, till the world has been in&s;ulted with their challenges. But it now appears that all this was vapour and vain boa&s;ting, or that it was intended to conceal abu&s;es and defects, and hu&s;h the people into taxes. I have taken the challenge up, and in behalf of the public have &s;hewn, in a fair, open, and candid man|ner,
<PB N="33" REF="33">both the radical and practical defects of the &s;y&s;tem; when, lo! tho&s;e champions of the Civil Lift have fled away, and &s;ent the Attorney-General to deny the challenge, by turning the acceptance of it into an attack, and defending their Places and Pen&s;ions by a pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>I will here drop this part of the &s;ubject, and &s;tate a few particulars re&s;pecting the pro&s;ecution now pending, by which the Addre&s;&s;ers will &s;ee that they have been u&s;ed as tools to the pro&s;ecuting party and their dependents. The ca&s;e is as follows:</P>
<P>The original edition of the Fir&s;t and Second Parts of RIGHTS OF MAN, having been expen|&s;ively printed (in the modern &s;tile of printing pamphlets, that they might be bound up with Mr. Burke's Reflections on the French Revolution,) the high price precluded the generality of people from purcha&s;ing; and many applications were made to me from various parts of the country to print the work in a cheaper manner. The people of Sheffield reque&s;ted leave to print two thou&s;and copies for them&s;elves, with which reque&s;t I immediately complied. The &s;ame reque&s;t came to me from Rotherham, from Leice&s;ter, from Che&s;ter, from &s;e|veral towns in Scotland; and Mr. James Mack|into&s;h, Author of <HI>Vindicia Gailica,</HI> brought me a reque&s;t from Warwick&s;hire, for leave to print ten thou&s;and copies in that country. I had already &s;ent a cheap edition to Scotland; and finding the ap|plications increa&s;e, I concluded that the be&s;t method of complying therewith, would be to print a very
<PB N="34" REF="34">numerous edition in London, under my own di|rection, by which means the work would be more perfect, and the price be reduced lower than it could be by <HI>printing</HI> &s;mall editions in the country of only a few thou&s;ands each.</P>
<P>The cheap edition of the Fir&s;t Part was begun about the middle of la&s;t April, and from that mo|ment, and not before, I expected a pro&s;ecution, and the event has proved that I was not mi&s;taken. I had then occa&s;ion to write to Mr. Thomas Walker, of Manche&s;ter, and after informing him of my intention of giving up the work for the pur|po&s;e of general information, I informed him of what I apprehended would be the con&s;equence; that while the work was at a price that precluded an exten&s;ive circulation, the Government-party, not able to controvert the plans, arguments, and principles it contained, had cho&s;en to remain &s;i|lent; but that I expected they would make an attempt to deprive the ma&s;s of the nation, and e&s;pecially the poor, of the right of reading, by the pretence of pro&s;ecuting either the Author or the Publi&s;her, or both. They cho&s;e to begin with the Publi&s;her.</P>
<P>Nearly a month, however, pa&s;&s;ed, before I had any information given me of their intentions. I was then at Bromley, in Kent, upon which I came immediately to town, (May 14) and went to Mr. Jordan, the publi&s;her of the original edition. He had that evening been &s;erved with a &s;ummons, to appear at the Court of King's Bench on the Mon|day
<PB N="35" REF="35">following, but for what purpo&s;e was not &s;tated. Suppo&s;ing it to be on account of the work, I appointed a meeting with him on the next morn|ing, which was accordingly had, when I provided an attorney, and took the expence of the defence on my&s;elf. But finding afterwards that he ab&s;ent|ed him&s;elf from the attorney employed, and had en|gaged another, and that he had been clo&s;eted with the Solicitors of the Trea&s;ury, I left him to follow his own choice, and he cho&s;e to plead Guilty. This he might do if he plea&s;ed; and I make no objec|tion again&s;t him for it. I believe that his idea by the word <HI>Guilty,</HI> was no other than declaring him|&s;elf to be the publi&s;her, without any regard to the merits or demerits of the work; for were it to be con&s;trued otherwi&s;e, it would amount to the ab|&s;urdity of converting a publi&s;her into a Jury, and his confe&s;&s;ion into a verdict upon the work it&s;elf. This would be the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible refinement upon packing of Juries.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of May, they commenced their pro|&s;ecution again&s;t me, as the Author, by leaving a &s;ummons at my lodgings in town, to appear at the Court of King's Bench on the 8th of June fol|lowing; and on the &s;ame day. (May 21) <HI>they i&s;&s;ued al&s;o their Proclamation.</HI> Thus the Court of St. James's, and the Court of King's Bench, were playing into each other's hands at the &s;ame in&s;tant of time, and the farce of Addre&s;&s;es brought up the rear; and this mode of proceeding is called by the pro&s;tituted name of Law. Such a thundering ra|pidity,
<PB N="36" REF="36">after a mini&s;terial dormancy of almo&s;t eigh|teen months, can be attributed to no other cau&s;e than their having gained information of the for|wardne&s;s of the cheap Edition, and the dread they felt at the progre&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of political know|ledge.</P>
<P>I was &s;trongly advi&s;ed by &s;everal gentlemen, as well tho&s;e in the practice of the Law, as others, to prefer a bill of indictment again&s;t the publi&s;her of the Proclamation, as a publication tending to in|fluence, or rather to dictate the verdict of a Jury on the i&s;&s;ue of a matter then pending; but it appeared to me much better to avail my&s;elf of the opportu|nity which &s;uch a precedent ju&s;tified me in u&s;ing, by meeting the Proclamation and the Addre&s;&s;es on their own ground, and publicly defending the Work which had been thus unwarrantable attacked and traduced.&mdash;And con&s;cious as I now am, that the Work entitled RIGHTS OF MAN, &s;o far from being, as has been maliciou&s;ly or erroneou&s;ly re|pre&s;ented, a fal&s;e, wicked, and &s;editious Libel, is a work abounding with unan&s;werable truths, with principles of the pure&s;t morality and benevolence, and with arguments not to be controverted&mdash;Con|&s;cious, I &s;ay, of the&s;e things, and having no object in view but the happine&s;s of mankind, I have now put the matter to the be&s;t proof in my power, by giving to the public a cheap edition of the Fir&s;t and Second Parts of that Work. Let every man read and judge for him&s;elf, not only of the merits or demerits of the Work, but of the matters therein
<PB N="37" REF="37">contained, which relate to his own intere&s;t and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>If, to expo&s;e the fraud and impo&s;ition of monar|chy, and every &s;pecies of hereditary government&mdash; to le&s;&s;en the oppre&s;&s;ion of taxes&mdash;to propo&s;e plans for the education of helple&s;s infancy, and the com|fortable &s;upport of the aged and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed&mdash;to en|deavour to conciliate nations to each other&mdash;to ex|tirpate the horrid practice of war&mdash;to promote univer&s;al peace, civilization, and commerce&mdash;and to break the chains of political &s;uper&s;tition, and rai&s;e degraded man to his proper rank;&mdash;if the&s;e things be libellous, let me live the life of a Libeller, and let the name of LIBELLER be engraven on my tomb.</P>
<P>Of all the weak and ill-judged mea&s;ures which fear, ignorance, or arrogance, could &s;ugge&s;t, the Proclamation, and the project for Addre&s;&s;es, are two of the wor&s;t. They &s;erved to adverti&s;e the work which the promoters of tho&s;e mea&s;ures wi&s;hed to keep unknown; and in doing this, they offered violence to the judgment of the people, by calling on them to condemn what they forbad them to know, and they put the &s;trength of their party to that hazardous i&s;&s;ue that prudence would have avoided&mdash;The County Meeting for Middle&s;ex was attended by only one hundred and eighteen Ad|dre&s;&s;ers. They, no doubt, expected, that thou&s;ands would &s;lock to their &s;tandard, and clamour again&s;t the <HI>Rights of Man.</HI> But the ca&s;e mo&s;t probably is, that men, in all countries, are not &s;o blind to
<PB N="38" REF="38">their Rights and their Intere&s;t, as Governments be|lieve.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn the extraordinary manner in which the Government-party commenced their at|tack, I proceed to offer a few ob&s;ervations on the pro&s;ecution, and on the mode of trial by Special Jury.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I have written a book; and if it cannot be refuted, it cannot be condemned. But I do not con&s;ider the pro&s;ecution as particularly levelled again&s;t me, but again&s;t the general right, or the right of every man, of inve&s;tigating &s;y&s;tems and principles of Government, and &s;hewing their &s;everal excellencies or defects. If the pre&s;s be free only to flatter Government, as Mr. Burke has done, and to cry up and extol what certain Court &s;ycophants are plea&s;ed to call a <Q>glorious Con&s;ti|tution, </Q> and not free to examine into its errors or abu&s;es, or whether a Con&s;titution really exi&s;t or not, &s;uch freedom is no other than that of Spain, Turkey, or Ru&s;&s;ia; and a Jury, in this ca&s;e, would not be a Jury to try, but an Inqui&s;ition to con|demn.</P>
<P>I have a&s;&s;erted, and by fair and open argument maintained, the right of every nation at all times, to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem and form of Government for it&s;elf as be&s;t accords with its di&s;po&s;ition, in|tere&s;t, and happine&s;s; and to change, or alter it, as it &s;ees occa&s;ion. Will any Jury deny to the Nation this right? If they do, they are traitors, and their Verdict would be null and void. And
<PB N="39" REF="39">if they admit the right, the means mu&s;t be admit|ted al&s;o; for it would be the highe&s;t ab&s;urdity to &s;ay, that the right exi&s;ted, but the means did not. The que&s;tion, then, is, What are the means by which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and exerci&s;e of this National Right are to the &s;ecured? The an&s;wer will be, that of maintaining, inviolably, the right of free inve&s;|tigation; for inve&s;tigation always &s;erves to detect error, and to bring forth truth.</P>
<P>I have, as an individual, given my opinion upon what I believe to be not only the be&s;t, but the true &s;y&s;tem of Government, which is the repre|&s;entative &s;y&s;tem, and I have given rea&s;ons for that opinion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e, in the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem, no office of very extraordinary power, or extravagant pay, is attached to any individual; and con&s;e|quently, there is nothing to excite tho&s;e national contentions and civil wars, with which countries under monarchical governments, are frequently convul&s;ed, and of which the Hi&s;tory of England exhibits &s;uch numerous in&s;tances.</P>
<P>Secondly, Becau&s;e the repre&s;entative is a &s;y&s;tem of Government always in maturity; whereas mo|narchical government fluctuates through all the &s;tages, from non-age to dotage.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Becau&s;e the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem ad|mits of none but men, properly qualified, into the Government, or removes them if they prove to be otherwi&s;e. Whereas, in the hereditary &s;y&s;tem, a nation may be encumbered with a knave or an
<PB N="40" REF="40">ideot, for a whole life-time, and not be benefited by a &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Becau&s;e there does not exi&s;t a right to e&s;tabli&s;h hereditary government, or in other words, hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, becau&s;e hereditary government always means a government yet to come, and the ca&s;e always is, that tho&s;e who are to live afterwards have always the &s;ame right to e&s;tabli&s;h government for them&s;elves, as the people had who lived before them; and, therefore, all laws attempting to e&s;tabli&s;h hereditary government, are founded on a&s;&s;umption and political fiction.</P>
<P>If the&s;e po&s;itions be truths, and I challenge any man to prove the contrary; if they tend to in|&s;truct and enlighten mankind, and to free them from error, oppre&s;&s;ion, and political &s;uper&s;tition, which are the objects I have in view, in publi&s;hing them, that Jury would commit an act of inju&s;tice to their country and to me, if not a act of per|jury, that &s;hould call them <HI>fal&s;e, wicked,</HI> and <HI>ma|licious.</HI></P>
<P>Dragonetti, in his treati&s;e "on Virtues and Re|wards," has a paragraph worthy of being recorded in every country in the world&mdash;<Q>The &s;cience, (&s;ays he,) of the politician, con&s;i&s;ts in fixing the true point of happine&s;s and freedom. Tho&s;e men would de&s;erve the gratitude of ages, who &s;hould di&s;cover a mode of government that con|tained the greate&s;t &s;um of <HI>individual happine&s;s</HI> with the lea&s;t <HI>national expence.</HI></Q> But if Juries are to be made u&s;e of to prohibit enquiry, to &s;up|pre&s;s
<PB N="41" REF="41">truth, and to &s;top the progre&s;s of knowledge, this boa&s;ted palladium of liberty becomes the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in&s;trument of tyranny.</P>
<P>Among the arts practi&s;ed at the Bar, and from the Bench, to impo&s;e upon the under&s;tanding of a Jury, and obtain a Verdict where the con&s;ciences of men could not otherwi&s;e con&s;ent, one of the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful has been that of calling <HI>truth a libel,</HI> and of in&s;inuating, that the words <Q><HI>fal&s;ely, wickedly,</HI> and <HI>maliciou&s;ly,</HI></Q> though they are made the for|midable and high &s;ounding part of the charge, are not matters for con&s;ideration with a Jury. For what purpo&s;e, then, are they retained, unle&s;s it be for that of impo&s;ition and wilful defamation?</P>
<P>I cannot conceive a greater violation of order, nor a more abominable in&s;ult upon morality and upon human under&s;tanding, than to &s;ee a man &s;it|ting in the judgment &s;eat, affecting, by an anti|quated foppery of dre&s;s, to impre&s;s the audience with awe; then cau&s;ing witne&s;&s;es and Jury to be &s;worn to truth and ju&s;tice, him&s;elf having offici|ally &s;worn the &s;ame; then cau&s;ing to be read a pro|&s;ecution again&s;t a man, charging him with having <HI>wickedly and maliciou&s;ly written and publi&s;hed a cer|tain fal&s;e, wicked, and &s;editious book;</HI> and having gone through all this with a &s;hew of &s;olemnity, as if he &s;aw the eye of the Almighty darting through the roof of the building like a ray of light, turn, in an in&s;tant, the whole into a farce, and, in order to obtain a verdict that could not otherwi&s;e be ob|tained, tell the Jury that the charge of <HI>fal&s;ely, wick|edly,
<PB N="42" REF="42">and &s;editiou&s;ly,</HI> meant nothing; that <HI>truth</HI> was out of the que&s;tion; and that whether the per&s;on accu&s;ed &s;poke truth or fal&s;hood, or intended <HI>virtu|ou&s;ly or wickedly,</HI> was the &s;ame thing; and finally conclude the wretched inqui&s;itorial &s;cene, by &s;tat|ing &s;ome antiquated precedent, equally as abomina|ble as that which is then acting, or giving &s;ome opinion of his own, and <HI>fal&s;ely calling the one and the other&mdash;Law.</HI> It was, mo&s;t probably, to &s;uch a Judge as this, that the mo&s;t &s;olemn of all reproofs was given&mdash;<Q><HI>The Lord will &s;mite thee, thou whit|ened wall.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I now proceed to offer &s;ome remarks on what is called a Special Jury.&mdash;As to what is called a Spe|cial Verdict, I &s;hall make no other remark upon it, than that it is in reality <HI>not</HI> a verdict. It is an attempt on the part of the Jury to delegate, or of the Bench to obtain, the exerci&s;e of that right which is committed to the Jury only.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Special Juries, I &s;hall &s;tate &s;uch matters as I have been able to collect, for I do not find any uniform opinion concerning the mode of appointing them.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, this mode of trial is but of modern invention, and the origin of it, as I am told, is a follows:</P>
<P>Formerly, when di&s;putes aro&s;e between Mer|chants, and were brought before a Court, the ca&s;e was, that the nature of their commerce, and the me|thod of keeping Merchants accounts, not being &s;ufficiently under&s;tood by per&s;ons out of their own
<PB N="43" REF="43">line, it became nece&s;&s;ary to depart from the com|mon mode of appointing Juries, and to &s;elect &s;uch per&s;ons for a Jury who&s;e <HI>practical knowledge</HI> would enable them to decide upon the ca&s;e. From this introduction, Special Juries became more general; but &s;ome doubts having ari&s;en as to their legality, an act was pa&s;&s;ed in the 3d of Geo. II. to e&s;tabli&s;h them as legal, and al&s;o to extend them to all ca&s;es, not only between individuals, but in ca&s;es where <HI>the Government it&s;elf &s;hould be the Pro&s;ecutor.</HI> This mo&s;t probably gave ri&s;e to the &s;u&s;picion &s;o gene|rally entertained of packing a Jury; becau&s;e, by this act, when the crown, as it is called, is the Pro|&s;ecutor, the Ma&s;ter of the Crown-office, who holds his office under the Crown, is the per&s;on who either wholly nominates, or has great power in nominating the Jury, and therefore it has greatly the appearance of the pro&s;ecuting party &s;electing a Jury.</P>
<P>The proce&s;s is as follows:</P>
<P>On motion being made in Court, by either the Plaintiff or Defendant, for a Special Jury, the Court grants it or not, at its own di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>If it be granted, the Solicitor of the party that applied for the Special Jury gives notice to the So|licitor of the adver&s;e party, and a day and hour are appointed for them to meet at the office of the Ma&s;|ter of the Crown-office. The Ma&s;ter of the Crown-office &s;ends to the Sheriff or his deputy, who attends with the Sheriff's book of Freeholders. From this book, forty-eight names are <HI>taken,</HI> and
<PB N="44" REF="44">a copy thereof given to each of the parties; and on a future day notice is again given, and the Solicitors meet a &s;econd time, and each &s;trikes out twelve names. The li&s;t being thus reduced from forty-eight to twenty-four, the fir&s;t twelve that appear in Court, and an&s;wer to their names, is the Special Jury for that cau&s;e. The fir&s;t operation, that of taking the forty-eight names, is called nominating the Jury; and the reducing them to twenty-four is called &s;triking the Jury.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;tated the general proce&s;s, I come to particulars, and the fir&s;t que&s;tion will be, how are the forty-eight names, out of which the Jury is to be &s;truck, obtained from the Sheriff's book? for herein lies the principal ground of &s;u&s;picion, with re&s;pect to what is under&s;tood by packing of Juries.</P>
<P>Either they mu&s;t be taken by &s;ome rule agreed upon between the parties, or by &s;ome common rule known and e&s;tabli&s;hed before-hand, or at the di&s;|cretion of &s;ome per&s;on, who, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, ought to be perfectly di&s;intere&s;ted in the i&s;&s;ue, as well officially as otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of Merchants, and in all ca&s;es between individuals, the Ma&s;ter of the office, called the Crown-office, is officially an indifferent per&s;on, and as &s;uch may be a proper per&s;on to act between the parties, and pre&s;ent them with a li&s;t of forty-eight names, out of which each party is to &s;trike twelve. But the ca&s;e a&s;&s;umes an entire different character when the Government it&s;elf is the Pro&s;ecutor. The Ma&s;ter of the Crown-office is then an officer
<PB N="45" REF="45">holding his office under the Pro&s;ecutor; and it is therefore no wonder that the &s;u&s;picion of packing Juries &s;hould, in &s;uch ca&s;es, have been &s;o prevalent.</P>
<P>This will apply with additional force, when the pro&s;ecution is commenced again&s;t the Author or Publi&s;her of &s;uch Works as treat of reforms, and of the abolition of &s;uperfluous places and offices, &amp;c. becau&s;e in &s;uch ca&s;es every per&s;on holding an office, &s;ubject to that &s;u&s;picion, becomes intere&s;ted as a party; and the office, called the Crown-office, may, upon examination, be found to be of this de|&s;cription.</P>
<P>I have heard it a&s;&s;erted, that the Ma&s;ter of the Crown office is to open the Sheriff's book as it were per hazard, and take thereout forty-eight <HI>fol|lowing</HI> names, to which the word Merchant or E&s;|quire is affixed. The former of the&s;e are cer|tainly proper, when the ca&s;e is between Merchants, and it has reference to the origin of the cu&s;tom, and to nothing el&s;e. As to the word E&s;quire, every man is an E&s;quire who plea&s;es to call him|&s;elf E&s;quire; and the &s;en&s;ible part of mankind are leaving it off. But the matter for enquiry is whe|ther there be any exi&s;ting law to direct the mode by which the forty-eight names &s;hall be taken, or whether the mode be merely that of cu&s;tom which the office has created; or whether the &s;election of the forty-eight names be wholly at the di&s;cretion and choice of the Ma&s;ter of the Crown-office? One or other of the two latter appears to be the ca&s;e, be|cau&s;e the act already mentioned, of the 3d of
<PB N="46" REF="46">Geo. II. lays down no rule or mode, nor refers to any preceding law&mdash;but &s;ays only, that Special Juries &s;hall hereafter be &s;truck, <Q><HI>in &s;uch manner as Spe|cial Juries have been and are u&s;ually &s;truck.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This act appears to me to have been what is generally under&s;tood by a <HI>"deep take in."</HI> It was fitted to the &s;pur of the moment in which it was pa&s;&s;ed, 3d of Geo. II when parties ran high, and it &s;erved to throw into the hands of Walpole, who was then Mini&s;ter, the management of Juries in Crown pro&s;ecutions, by making the nomination of the forty-eight per&s;ons, from whom the Jury was to be &s;truck, follow the precedent e&s;tabli&s;hed by cu&s;tom between individuals, and by this means it &s;lipt into practice with le&s;s &s;u&s;picion. Now, the manner of obtaining Special Juries through the medium of an officer of the Government, &s;uch for in&s;tance as a Ma&s;ter of the Crown-office, may be impartial in the ca&s;e of Merchants, or other indivi|duals, but it becomes highly improper and &s;u&s;pici|ous in ca&s;es where the Government it&s;elf is one of the parties. And it mu&s;t, upon the whole, appear a &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tency, that a Government &s;hould keep one officer to commence pro&s;ecutions, and another officer to nominate the forty-eight per&s;ons from whom the Jury is to be &s;truck, both of whom are <HI>officers of the Civil Li&s;t,</HI> and yet continue to call this by the pompous name of <HI>the glorious Right of trial by Jury!</HI></P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of the King again&s;t Jordan, for pub|li&s;hing RIGHTS OF MAN, the Attorney-General moved for the appointment of a Special Jury, and
<PB N="47" REF="47">the Ma&s;ter of the Crown-office nominated the forty-eight per&s;ons him&s;elf, and took them from &s;uch part of the Sheriff's book as he plea&s;ed. The trial did not come on, occa&s;ioned by Jordan withdraw|ing his plea; but if it had, it might have afforded an opportunity of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the &s;ubject of Special Juries; for though &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ion might have had no effect in the Court of King's-Bench, it would, in the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition for enquiry, have had a con&s;iderable effect upon the Country; and in all national reforms, this is the proper point to begin at. Put a Country right, and it will &s;oon put Go|vernment right. Among the improper things acted by the Government in the ca&s;e of Special Juries, on their own motion, one has been that of treating the Jury with a dinner, and afterwards giving each Juryman two guineas, if a verdict be found for the pro&s;ecution, and only one if otherwi&s;e; and it has been long ob&s;erved, that in London and We&s;t|min&s;ter there are per&s;ons who appear to make a trade of &s;erving, by being &s;o frequently &s;een upon Special Juries.</P>
<P>Thus much for Special Juries. As to what is called a <HI>Common Jury,</HI> upon any Government pro|&s;ecution again&s;t the Author or Publi&s;her of RIGHTS OF MAN, during the time of the <HI>pre&s;ent Sheriffry,</HI> I have one que&s;tion to offer, which is, <HI>whether the pre&s;ent Sheriffs of London, having publicly prejudged the ca&s;e, by the part they have taken in procuring an Addre&s;s from the county of Middle&s;ex, (however di|minutive and in&s;ignificant the number of Addre&s;&s;ers
<PB N="48" REF="48">were, being only one hundred and eighteen) are eligi|ble or proper per&s;ons to be entru&s;ted with the power of returning a Jury to try the i&s;&s;ue of any &s;uch pro&s;e|cution?</HI></P>
<P>But the whole matter appears, at lea&s;t to me, to be worthy of a more exten&s;ive con&s;ideration than what relates to any Jury, whether Special or Com|mon; for the ca&s;e is, whether any part of a whole nation, locally &s;elected as a Jury of twelve men al|ways is, be competent to judge and determine for the whole nation, on any matter that relates to &s;y&s;tems and principles of Government, and whether it be not applying the in&s;titution of Juries to pur|po&s;es for which &s;uch in&s;titution was not intended? For example,</P>
<P>I have a&s;&s;erted, in the Work RIGHTS OF MAN, that as every man in the nation pays taxes, &s;o has every man a right to a &s;hare in government, and con&s;equently that the people of Manche&s;ter, Bir|mingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Hallifax, &amp;c. &amp;c. have the &s;ame right as tho&s;e of London. Shall then twelve men, picked out between Temple-bar and Whitechapel, becau&s;e the book happened to be fir&s;t publi&s;hed there, decide upon the rights of the inhabitants of tho&s;e towns, or of any other town or village in the nation?</P>
<P>Having thus &s;poken of Juries, I come next to offer a few ob&s;ervations on the matter contained in the information or pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>The work, RIGHTS OF MAN, consi&s;ts of Part the Fir&s;t, and Part the Second. The Fir&s;t Part the
<PB N="49" REF="49">pro&s;ecutor has thought it mo&s;t proper to let alone; and from the Second Part he has &s;elected a few &s;hort paragraphs, making in the whole not quite two pages of the &s;ame printing as in the cheap edi|tion. Tho&s;e paragraphs relate chiefly to certain facts, &s;uch as the Revolution of 1688, and the coming of George the Fir&s;t, commonly called of the Hou&s;e of Hanover, or the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick, or &s;ome &s;uch hou&s;e. The arguments, plans, and princi|ples, contained in the work, the pro&s;ecutor has not ventured to attack. They are beyond his reach.</P>
<P>The Act which the pro&s;ecutor appears to re&s;t mo&s;t upon for the &s;upport of the pro&s;ecution, is the Act intituled, <Q>An Act, declaring the rights and liberties of the &s;ubject, and &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of the crown,</Q> pa&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t year of William and Mary, and more commonly known by the name of the "Bill of Rights."</P>
<P>I have called this Bill <Q><HI>A Bill of wrongs and of in&s;ult.</HI></Q> My rea&s;ons, and al&s;o my proofs, are as fol|lows:</P>
<P>The method and principle which this Bill takes for declaring rights and liberties, are in direct con|tradiction to rights and liberties; it is an a&s;&s;umed attempt to take them wholly away from po&s;terity&mdash;for the declaration in the &s;aid Bill is as follows:</P>
<P><Q>The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, do, in <HI>the name of all the people,</HI> mo&s;t humbly and faithfully <HI>&s;ubmit them&s;elves, their heirs, and po&s;terity for ever;</HI></Q> that is, to William
<PB N="50" REF="50">and Mary his wife, their heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. This is a &s;trange way of declaring rights and liberties. But the Parliament who made this declaration in the name, and on the part, of the people, had no authority from them for &s;o doing&mdash;and with re&s;pect to <HI>po&s;terity for ever,</HI> they had no right or authority whatever in the ca&s;e. It was a&s;&s;umption and u&s;ur|pation. I have rea&s;oned very exten&s;ively again&s;t the principle of this Bill in the fir&s;t part of Rights of Man; the pro&s;ecutor has &s;ilently admitted that rea&s;oning, and he now commences a pro&s;ecution on the authority of the Bill, after admitting the rea|&s;oning again&s;t it.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that the declaration in this Bill, abject and irrational as it is, had no other intentional operation than again&s;t the family of the Stuarts, and their abettors. The idea did not then exi&s;t, that in the &s;pace of an hundred years, po&s;te|rity might di&s;cover a different and much better &s;y&s;tem of government, and that every &s;pecies of here|ditary government might fall as Popes and Monks had fallen before. This, I &s;ay, was not then thought of, and therefore the application of the Bill, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, is a new, erroneous, and illegal application, and is the &s;ame as creating a new Bill <HI>ex po&s;t facto.</HI></P>
<P>I has ever been the craft of Courtiers, for the purpo&s;e of keeping up an expen&s;ive and enormous Civil Lift, and a mummery of u&s;ele&s;s and anti|quated places and offices at the public expence, to
<PB N="51" REF="51">be continually hanging England upon &s;ome indivi|dual or other, called <HI>king,</HI> though the man might not have capacity to be a pari&s;h con&s;table. The folly and ab&s;urdity of this is appearing more and more every day; and &s;till tho&s;e men continue to act as if no alteration in the public opinion had taken place. They hear each other's non&s;en&s;e, and &s;up|po&s;e the whole nation talks the &s;ame Gibberi&s;h.</P>
<P>Let &s;uch men cry up the Hou&s;e of Orange, or the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick, if they plea&s;e. They would cry up any other hou&s;e if it &s;uited their pur|po&s;e, and give as good rea&s;ons for it. But what is this hou&s;e, or that hou&s;e, or any hou&s;e to a nation? <Q><HI>For a nation to be free, it is &s;ufficient that &s;he wills it.</HI></Q> Her freedom depends wholly upon her|&s;elf, and not on any hou&s;e, nor on any individual. I a&s;k not in what light this cargo of foreign hou&s;es appears to others, but I will &s;ay in what light it appears to me.&mdash;It was like the trees of the fore&s;t &s;aying unto the bramble, come thou and reign over us.</P>
<P>Thus much for both their hou&s;es. I now come to &s;peak of two other hou&s;es, which are al&s;o put into the information, and tho&s;e are, the Hou&s;e of Lords, and the Hou&s;e of Commons. Here, I &s;up|po&s;e, the Attorney-General intends to prove me guilty of &s;peaking either truth or fal&s;hood; for, ac|cording to the modern interpretation of Libels, it does not &s;ignify which, and the only improvement nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew the compleat ab&s;urdity of &s;uch
<PB N="52" REF="52">doctrine, would be, to pro&s;ecute a man for utter|ing a mo&s;t <HI>fal&s;e and wicked truth.</HI></P>
<P>I will quote the part I am going to give, from the office Copy, with the Attorney General's inuen|does, enclo&s;ed in parenthe&s;es as they &s;tand in the in|formation, and I hope that civil li&s;t officer will cau|tion the Court not to laugh when he reads them, and al&s;o to take care not to laugh him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The information &s;tates, that <HI>Thomas Paine being a wicked, malicious, &s;editious, and evil-di&s;po&s;ed per|&s;on, hath, with force and arms, and mo&s;t wicked cun|ning, written and publi&s;hed a certain fal&s;e, &s;candalous, malicious, and &s;editious libel; in one part thereof, to the tenor and effect following, that is to &s;ay</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>With re&s;pect to the two Hou&s;es, of which the Engli&s;h Parliament <HI>(meaning the Parliament of this Kingdom)</HI> is compo&s;ed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a Legi&s;|lature, to have no temper of its own; The Mi|ni&s;ter, <HI>(meaning the Mini&s;ter employed by the King of this Realm, in the admini&s;tration of the Govern|ment thereof)</HI> whoever he, at any time may be, touches IT, <HI>(meaning the two Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment of this Kingdom)</HI> as with an opium wand, and IT <HI>(meaning the two Hou&s;es of Parliament of this Kingdom)</HI> &s;leeps obedience.</Q>&mdash;As I am not ma|licious enough to di&s;turb their repo&s;e, though it be time they &s;hould awake, I leave the two Hou&s;es, and the Attorney General, to the enjoyment of their dreams, and proceed to a new &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="53">The Gentlemen, to whom I &s;hall next addre&s;s my|&s;elf, are tho&s;e who have &s;tiled them&s;elves <Q><HI>Friends of the people,</HI></Q> holding their meeting at the Free|ma&s;ons' Tavern, London.</P>
<P>One of the principal Members of this Society, is Mr. Grey, who, I believe, is al&s;o one of the mo&s;t independent Members in Parliament. I collect this opinion from what Mr. Burke formerly mentioned to me, rather than from any knowledge of my own. The occa&s;ion was as follows:</P>
<P>I was in England at the time the bubble broke forth about Nootka Sound; and the day after the King's Me&s;&s;age, as it is called, was &s;ent to Parlia|ment, I wrote a note to Mr. Burke, that upon the condition the French Revolution &s;hould not be a &s;ubject (for he was then writing the book I have &s;ince an&s;wered) I would call on him the next day, and mention &s;ome matters I was acquainted with, re&s;pecting that affair; for it appeared to me extra|ordinary, that any body of men, calling them&s;elves Repre&s;entatives, &s;hould commit them&s;elves &s;o pre|cipitately, or, "&s;leep obedience," as Parliament was then doing, and run a nation into expence, and, perhaps a war, without &s;o much as enquiring into the ca&s;e, or the &s;ubject, of both which I had &s;ome knowledge.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw Mr. Burke, and mentioned the cir|cum&s;tances to him, he particularly &s;poke of Mr. Grey, as the fitte&s;t Member to bring &s;uch matters forward; for, &s;aid Mr. Burke, <Q><HI>I am not the pro|per</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="54">per&s;on to do it, as I am in a treaty with Mr. Pitt about Mr. Ha&s;tings's trial.</Q> I hope the At|torney General will allow, that Mr. Burke was then <HI>&s;leeping his obedience.</HI>&mdash;But to return to the Society&mdash;</P>
<P>I cannot bring my&s;elf to believe, that the general motive of this Society is any thing more than that by which every former parliamentary oppo&s;ition has been governed, and by which the pre&s;ent is &s;ufficiently known. Failing in their pur&s;uit of power and place within doors, they have now (and that not in a very mannerly manner) endeavoured to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of that ground out of doors, which, had it not been made by others, would not have been made by them. They appear to me to have watched, with more cunning than candour, the progre&s;s of a certain publication, and when they &s;aw it had excited a &s;pirit of enquiry, and was ra|pidly &s;preading, they &s;tepped forward to profit by the opportunity, and Mr. Fox <HI>then</HI> called it a Libel. In &s;aying this, he libelled him&s;elf. Politicians of this ca&s;t, &s;uch, I mean, as tho&s;e who trim between parties, and lye by for events, are to be found in every country, and it never yet happened that they did not do more harm than good. They embar|ra&s;s bu&s;ine&s;s, fritter it to nothing, perplex the people, and the event to them&s;elves generally is, that they go ju&s;t far enough to make enemies of the few, without going far enough to make friends of the many.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="55">Whoever will read the declarations of this So|ciety, of the 25th of April, and 5th of May, will find a &s;tudied re&s;erve upon all the points that are real abu&s;es. They &s;peak not once of the extrava|gance of Government, of the abominable li&s;t of un|nece&s;&s;ary and &s;inecure places and pen&s;ions, of the enormity of the Civil Li&s;t, of the exce&s;s of taxes, nor of any one matter that &s;ub&s;tantially affects the nation; and from &s;ome conver&s;ation that has pa&s;&s;ed in that Society, it does not appear to me that it is any part of their plan, to carry this cla&s;s of reforms into practice. No Oppo&s;ition Party ever did, when it gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In making the&s;e free ob&s;ervations, I mean not to enter into contention with this Society, their inci|vility towards me is what I &s;hould expect from place-hunting reformers. They are welcome, how|ever, to the ground they have advanced upon, and I wi&s;h that every individual among them may act in the &s;ame upright, uninfluenced, and public &s;pi|rited manner that I have done. Whatever reforms may be obtained, and by whatever means, they will be for the benefit of others, and not of me. I have no other intere&s;t in the cau&s;e than the intere&s;t of my heart. The part I have acted has been wholly that of a volunteer, unconnected with party; and when I quit, it &s;hall be as honourably as I began.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider the reform of Parliament, by an ap|plication to Parliament, as propo&s;ed by the Society,
<PB N="56" REF="56">to be a worn-out hackneyed &s;ubject, about which the nation is tired, and the parties are deceiving each other. It is not a &s;ubject that is cognizable before Parliament, becau&s;e no Government has a right to alter it&s;elf, either in whole or in part. The right, and the exerci&s;e of that right, apper|tains to the nation only, and the proper mean is by a national convention, elected for the purpo&s;e, by all the people. By this, the will of the nation, whether to reform or not, or what the reform &s;hall be, or how far it &s;hall extend, will be known, and it cannot be known by any other means. Partial addre&s;&s;es, or &s;eparate a&s;&s;ociations, are not te&s;ti|monies of the general will.</P>
<P>It is, however, certain that the opinions of men, with re&s;pect to &s;y&s;tems and principles of govern|ment, are changing fa&s;t in all countries. The al|teration in England, within the &s;pace of little more than a year, is far greater than could then have been believed, and it is daily and hourly increa&s;ing. It moves along the country with the &s;ilence of thought. The enormous expence of Government has provoked men to think, by making them feel; and the Proclamation has &s;erved to increa&s;e jealou&s;y and di&s;gu&s;t. To prevent, therefore, tho&s;e commo|tions which too often and too &s;uddenly ari&s;e from &s;uffocated di&s;contents, it is be&s;t that the general WILL &s;hould have the full and free opportunity of being publicly a&s;certained and known.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="57">Wretched as the &s;tate of repre&s;entation is in England, it is every day becoming wor&s;e, becau&s;e the unrepre&s;ented parts of the nation are increa&s;ing in population and property, and the repre&s;ented parts are decrea&s;ing. It is, therefore, no ill grounded e&s;timation to &s;ay, that as not one per&s;on in &s;even is repre&s;ented, at lea&s;t fourteen millions of taxes, out of the &s;eventeen millions, are paid by the unrepre&s;ented part; for although copyholds and lea&s;eholds are a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to the land-tax, the holders are unrepre&s;ented. Should then a general demur take place as to the obligation of paying taxes, on the ground of not being repre&s;ented, it is not the Repre&s;entatives of rotten Boroughs, nor Special Juries, that can decide the que&s;tion. This is one of the po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es that ought to be fore&s;een, in order to prevent the inconveniencies that might ari&s;e to numerous individuals, by provoking it.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I have no idea of petitioning for rights. Whatever the rights of people are, they have a right to them, and none have a right either to withhold them, or to grant them. Government ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed on &s;uch principles of ju&s;tice as to exclude the occa&s;ion of all &s;uch applications, for wherever they appear they are virtually accu|&s;ations.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h that Mr. Grey, &s;ince he has embarked in the bu&s;ine&s;s, would take the whole of it into con|&s;ideration. He will then &s;ee that the right of re|forming the &s;tate of the Repre&s;entation does not
<PB N="58" REF="58">re&s;ide in Parliament, and that the only motion he could con&s;i&s;tently make, would be, that Parliament &s;hould <HI>recommend</HI> the election of a convention by all the people, becau&s;e all pay taxes. But whether Parliament recommended it or not, the right of the nation would neither be le&s;&s;ened nor increa&s;ed thereby.</P>
<P>As to Petitions from the unrepre&s;ented part, they ought not to be looked for. As well might it be expected that Manche&s;ter, Sheffield, &amp;c. &s;hould petition the rotten Boroughs, as that they &s;hould petition the Repre&s;entatives of tho&s;e Bo|roughs. Tho&s;e two towns alone pay far more taxes than all the rotten Boroughs put together, and it is &s;carcely to be expected they &s;hould pay their court either to the Boroughs, or the Borough-mongers.</P>
<P>It ought al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that what is called Parliament, is compo&s;ed of two hou&s;es that have always declared again&s;t the right of each other to interfere in any matter that related to the circum|&s;tances of either, particularly that of election. A reform, therefore, in the repre&s;entation cannot, on the ground they have individually taken, become the &s;ubject of an act of Parliament, becau&s;e &s;uch a mode would include the interference, again&s;t which the Commons on their part have prote&s;ted; but mu&s;t, as well on the ground of formality, as on that of right, proceed from a National Convention.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="59">Let Mr. Grey, or any other man, &s;it down and endeavour to put his thoughts together, for the purpo&s;e of drawing up an application to Parliament for a reform of Parliament, and he will &s;oon con|vince him&s;elf of the folly of the attempt. He will find that he cannot get on; that he cannot make his thoughts join, &s;o as to produce any effect; for whatever formality of words he may u&s;e, they will unavoidably include two ideas directly oppo&s;ed to each other; the one in &s;etting forth the rea&s;ons, the other in praying for the relief, and the two, when placed together, would &s;tand thus:&mdash;<Q><HI>The Repre&s;entation in Parliament is &s;o very corrupt, that we can no longer confide in it,&mdash;and, there|fore, confiding in the ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom of Parlia|ment, we pray,</HI></Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The heavy manner in which every former pro|po&s;ed application to Parliament has dragged, &s;uffi|ciently &s;hews, that though the nation might not exactly &s;ee the awkwardne&s;s of the mea&s;ure, it could not clearly &s;ee its way by that mean. To this al&s;o may be added another remark, which is, that the wor&s;e Parliament is, the le&s;s will be the in|clination to petition it. This indifference, viewed as it ought to be, is one of the &s;tronge&s;t cen&s;ures the public can expre&s;s. It is as if they were to &s;ay, "Ye are not worth reforming."</P>
<P>Let any man examine the Court-Kalendar of Placemen in both Hou&s;es, and the manner in which the Civil Li&s;t operates, and he will be at
<PB N="60" REF="60">no lo&s;s to account for this indifference and want of confidence on one &s;ide, nor of the oppo&s;ition to reforms on the other.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the numerous li&s;t of paid per&s;ons exhi|bited in the Court-Kalendar, which &s;o indecently &s;tares the nation in the face, there is an unknown number of ma&s;ked Pen&s;ioners, which renders Par|liament &s;till more &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>Who would have &s;uppo&s;ed that Mr. Burke, holding forth as he formerly did again&s;t &s;ecret in|fluence, and corrupt majorities, &s;hould become a concealed Pen&s;ioner? I will now &s;tate the ca&s;e, not for the little purpo&s;e of expo&s;ing Mr. Burke, but to &s;hew the incon&s;i&s;tency of any application to a body of men, more than half of whom, as far as the nation can at pre&s;ent know, may be in the &s;ame ca&s;e with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Towards the end of Lord North's admini&s;tra|tion, Mr. Burke brought a bill into Parliament, generally known by the name of Mr. Burke's Reform Bill; in which, among other things, it is enacted, <Q>That no pen&s;ion, exceeding the &s;um of three hundred pounds a year, &s;hall be granted to any one per&s;on, and that the whole amount of the pen&s;ions granted in one year &s;hall not exceed &s;ix hundred pounds; a li&s;t of which, together with the <HI>names of the per&s;ons</HI> to whom the &s;ame are granted, &s;hall be laid before Par|liament in twenty days after the beginning of each &s;e&s;&s;ion, until the whole pen&s;ion li&s;t &s;hall be
<PB N="61" REF="61">reduced to ninety thou&s;and pounds.</Q> A provi&s;ory clau&s;e is afterwards added, <Q>That it &s;hall be lawful for the Fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury, to return into the Exchequer, any pen&s;ion or an|nuity, <HI>without a name,</HI> on his making oath that &s;uch pen&s;ion or annuity is not directly or indi|rectly for the benefit, u&s;e, or behoof, of any Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons.</Q></P>
<P>But &s;oon after that Admini&s;tration ended, and the party Mr. Burke acted with came into power, it appears, from the circum&s;tances I am going to relate, that Mr. Burke became him&s;elf a Pen&s;ioner in di&s;gui&s;e; in a &s;imiliar manner, as if a pen&s;ion had been granted in the name of John Nokes, to be privately paid to and enjoyed by Tom Stiles. The name of Edmund Burke does not appear in the ori|ginal tran&s;action: but after the pen&s;ion was ob|tained, Mr. Burke wanted to make the mo&s;t of it at once, by &s;elling or mortgaging it; and the gen|tleman, in who&s;e name the pen&s;ion &s;tands, applied to one of the public offices for that purpo&s;e. This unfortunately brought forth the name of <HI>Edmund Burke,</HI> as the real Pen&s;ioner of 1,500l. per annum. When men trumpet forth what they call the ble&s;|&s;ings of the Con&s;titution, it ought to be known what &s;ort of ble&s;&s;ings they allude to.</P>
<P>As to the Civil Li&s;t, of a million a year, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that any one man can eat, drink, or con&s;ume the whole upon him&s;elf. The ca&s;e is, that above half this &s;um is annually apportioned among
<PB N="62" REF="62">Courtiers, and Court Members, of both Hou&s;es, in places and offices, altogether in&s;ignificant and per|fectly u&s;ele&s;s, as to every purpo&s;e of civil, rational, and manly government. For in&s;tance,</P>
<P>Of what u&s;e in the &s;cience and &s;y&s;tem of Govern|ment is what is called a Lord Chamberlain, a Ma|&s;ter and a Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Robes, a Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, a Ma&s;ter of the Hawks, and an hundred other &s;uch things. Laws derive no additional force, nor additional excellence, from &s;uch mummery.</P>
<P>In the di&s;bur&s;ements of the Civil Li&s;t for the year 1786 (which may be &s;een in Sir John Sinclair's Hi&s;tory of the Revenue) are four &s;eparate charges for this mummery office of Chamberlain.</P>

<P>From this &s;ample, the re&s;t may be gue&s;&s;ed at. As to the Ma&s;ter of the Hawks, (there are no hawks kept, and if there were, it is no rea&s;on the people &s;hould pay the expence of feeding them, many of whom are put to it to get bread for their children) his &s;alary is 1,372<HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>And be&s;ides a li&s;t of items of this kind, &s;ufficient to fill a quire of paper, the Pen&s;ion li&s;ts alone are 107,404<HI>l.</HI> 13<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> which is a greater &s;um than
<PB N="63" REF="63">all the expences of the federal Government in Ame|rica amount to.</P>
<P>Among the items, there are two I had no expecta|tion of finding, and which, in this day of enquiry after Civil Li&s;t influence, ought to be expo&s;ed. The one is an annual payment of one thou&s;and &s;even hundred pounds to the Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters in Eng|land, and eight hundred pounds to tho&s;e of Ireland.</P>
<P>This is the fact; and the di&s;tribution <HI>as I am in|formed,</HI> is as follows: The whole &s;um of &pound;. 1,700 is paid to one per&s;on, a di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter in Lon|don, who divides it among eight others, and tho&s;e eight among &s;uch others as they plea&s;e. The Lay|body of the Di&s;&s;enters, and many of their principal Mini&s;ters, have long con&s;idered it as di&s;honourable, and have endeavoured to prevent it, but &s;till it continues to be &s;ecretly paid; and as the world has &s;ometimes &s;een very ful&s;ome Addre&s;&s;es from parts of that body, it may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed that the receivers, like Bi&s;hops and other Court-Clergy, are not idle in promoting them. How the money is di&s;tributed in Ireland, I know not.</P>
<P>To recount all the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of the Civil Li&s;t is not the intention of this publication. It is &s;uffi|cient, in this place, to expo&s;e its general character, and the ma&s;s of influence it keeps alive. It will nece&s;&s;arily become one of the objects of reform; and therefore enough is &s;aid to &s;hew that, under its operation, no application to Parliament can be ex|pected to &s;ucceed, nor can con&s;i&s;tently be made.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="64">Such reforms will not be promoted by the Party that is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e places, nor by the Op|po&s;ition who are waiting for them; and as to a <HI>mere reform</HI> in the &s;tate of the Repre&s;entation, under the idea that another Parliament, differently elected to the pre&s;ent, but &s;till a component third part of the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem, and &s;ubject to the controul of the other two parts, will aboli&s;h tho&s;e abu&s;es, is altogether delu&s;ion; becau&s;e it is not only impracticable on the ground of formality, but is unwi&s;ely expo&s;ing another &s;et of men to the &s;ame corruptions that have tainted the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Were all the objects that require a reform ac|compli&s;hable by a mere reform in the &s;tate of the Repre&s;entation, the per&s;ons who compo&s;e the pre|&s;ent Parliament might, with rather more propriety be a&s;ked to aboli&s;h all the abu&s;es them&s;elves, than be applied to as the mere in&s;truments of doing it by a future Parliament. If the virtue be wanting to aboli&s;h the abu&s;e, it is al&s;o wanting to act as the means, and the nation mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, proceed by &s;ome other plan.</P>
<P>Having thus endeavoured to &s;hew what the ab|ject condition of Parliament is, and the impropriety of going a &s;econd time over the &s;ame ground that has before mi&s;carried, I come to the remaining part of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>There ought to be, in the con&s;titution of every country, a mode of referring back, on any extraor|dinary occa&s;ion, to the &s;overeign and original con|&s;tituent
<PB N="65" REF="65">power, which is the nation it&s;elf. The right of altering any part of a Government cannot, as already ob&s;erved, re&s;ide in the Government, or that Government might make it&s;elf what it plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>It ought al&s;o to be taken for granted, that though a nation may feel inconveniencies, either in the ex|ce&s;s of taxation, or in the mode of expenditure, or in any thing el&s;e, it may not at fir&s;t be &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured in what part of its government the defect lies, or where the evil originates. It may be &s;up|po&s;ed to be in one part, and on enquiry be found to be in another; or partly in all. This ob&s;curity is naturally interwoven with what are called mixed Governments.</P>
<P>Be, however, the reform to be accompli&s;hed whatever it may, it can only follow in con&s;equence of fir&s;t obtaining a full knowledge of all the cau&s;es that have rendered &s;uch reform nece&s;&s;ary, and every thing &s;hort of this is gue&s;s-work or frivolous cunning. In this ca&s;e, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that any application to Parliament can bring forward this knowledge. That body is it&s;elf the &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;e, or one of the &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;es, of the abu&s;es in que&s;tion; and cannot be expected, and ought not to be a&s;ked, to give evidence again&s;t it&s;elf. The enquiry, therefore, which is of nece&s;&s;ity the fir&s;t &s;tep in the bu&s;ine&s;s, cannot be entru&s;ted to Parliament, but mu&s;t be undertaken by a di&s;tinct body of men, &s;eparated from every &s;u&s;picion of corruption or in|fluence.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="66">In&s;tead, then, of referring to rotten Boroughs and ab&s;urd Corporations for Addre&s;&s;es, or hawking them about the country to be &s;igned by a few de|pendant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enants, the real and effectual mode would be to come at once to the point, and to a&s;certain the &s;en&s;e of the nation by electing a National Con|vention. By this method, as already ob&s;erved, the general WILL, whether to reform or not, or what the reform &s;hall be, or how far it &s;hall extend, will be known, and it cannot be known by any other means. Such a body, empowered and &s;upported by the nation, will have authority to demand in|formation upon all matters nece&s;&s;ary to be enquired into; and no Mini&s;ter, nor any other per&s;on, will dare to refu&s;e it. It will then be &s;een whether &s;e|ventern millions of taxes are nece&s;&s;ary, and for what purpo&s;es they are expended. The concealed Pen|&s;ioners will then be obliged to unma&s;k; and the &s;ource of influence and corruption, if any &s;uch there be, will be laid open to the nation, not for the pur|po&s;e of revenge, but of redre&s;s.</P>
<P>By taking this public and national ground, all objections again&s;t partial Addre&s;&s;es on one &s;ide, or private a&s;&s;ociations on the other, will be done away. THE NATION WILL DECREE ITS OWN REFORMS; and the clamour about Party and Faction, or Ins or Outs, will become ridiculous.</P>
<P>The plan and organization of a Convention is ea&s;y in practice.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="67">In the fir&s;t place, the number of inhabitants in every county can be &s;ufficiently enough known, from the number of hou&s;es a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to the Hou&s;e and Window-light tax in each county. This will give the rule for apportioning the number of Mem|bers to be elected to the National Convention in each of the counties.</P>
<P>If the total number of inhabitants in England be &s;even millions, and the total number of Members to be elected to the Convention be one thou&s;and, the number of Members to be elected in a county containing one hundred and fifty thou&s;and inha|bitants will be <HI>twenty-one,</HI> and in like proportion for any other county.</P>
<P>As the election of a Convention mu&s;t, in order to a&s;certain the general &s;en&s;e of the nation, go on grounds different from that of Parliamentary elec|tions, the mode that be&s;t promi&s;es this end will have no difficulties to combat with from ab&s;urd cu&s;toms and pretended rights. The right of every man will be the &s;ame, whether he lives in a city, a town, or a village. The cu&s;tom of attaching Rights to <HI>place,</HI> or in other words to inanimate matter, in&s;tead of to the <HI>per&s;on,</HI> independently of place, is too ab&s;urd to make any part of a rational argument.</P>
<P>As every man in the nation of the age of twenty-one years pays taxes, either out of the property he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es, or out of the product of his labour, which is property to him; and is amenable in his own per|&s;on to every law of the land; &s;o has every one the
<PB N="68" REF="68">&s;ame equal right to vote, and no one part of a na|tion, nor any individual, has a right to di&s;pute the right of another. The man who &s;hould do this ought to forfeit the exerci&s;e of his <HI>own</HI> right, for a term of years. This would render the puni&s;hment con&s;i&s;tent with the crime.</P>
<P>When a qualification to vote is regulated by years, it is placed on the firme&s;t po&s;&s;ible ground, becau&s;e the qualification is &s;uch as nothing but dy|ing before the time can take away; and the equa|lity of Rights, as a principle, is recognized in the act of regulating the exerci&s;e. But when Rights are placed upon, or made dependant upon pro|perty, they are on the mo&s;t precarious of all tenures. "Riches make them&s;elves wings, and fly away," and the rights fly with them; and thus they be|come lo&s;t to the man when they would be of mo&s;t value.</P>
<P>It is from a &s;trange mixture of tyranny and cowar|dice, that exclu&s;ions have been &s;et up and conti|nued. The boldne&s;s to do wrong at fir&s;t, changes afterwards into cowardly craft, and at la&s;t into fear. The Repre&s;entatives in England appear now to act as if they were afraid to do right, even in part, le&s;t it &s;hould awaken the nation to a &s;en&s;e of all the wrongs it has endured. This ca&s;e &s;erves to &s;hew that the &s;ame conduct that be&s;t con&s;titutes the &s;afety of an individual, namely, a &s;trict adherence to prin|ciple, con&s;titutes al&s;o the &s;afety of a Government, and that without it &s;afety is but an empty name.
<PB N="69" REF="69">When the rich plunder the poor of his rights, it becomes an example to the poor to plunder the rich of his property; for the rights of the one are as much property to him as wealth is property to the other, and the <HI>little all</HI> is as dear as the <HI>much.</HI> It is only by &s;etting out on ju&s;t principles that men are trained to be ju&s;t to each other; and it will always be found, that when the rich protect the rights of the poor, the poor will protect the property of the rich. But the gaurantee, to be effectual, mu&s;t be parliamentarily reciprocal.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ions are not only unju&s;t, but they fre|quently operate as injuriou&s;ly to the party who mo|nopolizes, as to tho&s;e who are excluded. When men &s;eek to exclude others from participating in the exerci&s;e of any right, they &s;hould, at lea&s;t, be a&s;&s;ured that thay can effectually perform the whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s they undertake; for unle&s;s they do this, them&s;elves will be lo&s;ers by the monopoly. This has been the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the monopo|lized right of Election. The monopolizing party has not been able to keep the Parliamentary Re|pre&s;entation, to whom the power of taxation was entru&s;ted, in the &s;tate it ought to have been, and have thereby multiplied taxes upon them&s;elves equally with tho&s;e who were excluded.</P>
<P>A great deal has been, and will continue to be &s;aid, about di&s;qualifications, ari&s;ing from the com|mi&s;&s;ion of offences; but were this &s;ubject urged to its full extent, it would di&s;qualify a great number of the pre&s;ent Electors, together with their Repre&s;en|tatives;
<PB N="70" REF="70">for, of all offences, none are more de&s;truc|tive to the morals of Society than Bribery and Cor|ruption. It is, therefore, civility to &s;uch per&s;ons to pa&s;s this &s;ubject over, and to give them a fair opportunity of recovering, or rather of creating character.</P>
<P>Every thing, in the pre&s;ent mode of electioneer|ing in England, is the rever&s;e of what it ought to he, and the vulgarity that attends elections is no o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er than the natural con&s;equence of inverting the order of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, the Candidate &s;eeks the Elec|tor, in&s;tead of the Elector &s;eeking for a Repre&s;enta|tive; and the Electors are advertized as being in the intere&s;t of the Candidate, in&s;tead of the Candi|date being in the intere&s;t of the Electors. The Candidate pays the Elector for his vote, in&s;tead of the Nation paying the Repre&s;entative for his time and attendance on public bu&s;ine&s;s. The complaint for an undue election is brought by the Candidate, as if he, and not the Electors, were the party ag|grieved; and he takes on him&s;elf, at any period of the elector, to break it up, by declining, as if the election was in his right, and not in theirs.</P>
<P>The compact that was entered into at the la&s;t We&s;tmin&s;ter election between two of the Candidates (Mr. Fox and Lord Hood) was an indecent viola|tion of the principles of election. The Candidates a&s;&s;umed, in their own per&s;ons, the rights of the Electors; for it was only in the body of the Elec|tors,
<PB N="71" REF="71">and not at all in the Candidates, that the right of making any &s;uch compact or compromi&s;e could exi&s;t. But the principle of Election and Repre&s;en|tation is &s;o compleatly done away, in every &s;tage thereof, that incon&s;i&s;tency has no long<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r the power of &s;urpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>Neither from elections thus conducted, nor from rotten Borough Addre&s;&s;ers, nor from County-meetings, promoted by Placemen and Pen&s;ioners, can the &s;en&s;e of the nation be known. It is &s;till corruption appealing to it&s;elf. But a Convention of a thou&s;and per&s;ons, fairly elected, would bring every matter to a decided i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>As to County-meetings, it is only per&s;ons of lei|&s;ure, or tho&s;e who live near to the place of meeting, that can attend, and the number on &s;uch occa&s;ions is but like a drop in the bucket compared with the whole. The only con&s;i&s;tent &s;ervice which &s;uch meetings could render, would be that of apportion|ing the county into convenient di&s;tricts; and when this is done, each di&s;trict might, according to its number of inhabitants, elect its quota of County Members to the National Convention; and the vote of each Elector might be taken in the pari&s;h where he re&s;ided, either by ballot or by voice, as he &s;hould chu&s;e to give it.</P>
<P>A National Convention thus formed would bring together the &s;en&s;e and opinions of every part of the nation, fairly taken. The &s;cience of Government, and the intere&s;t of the Public, and of the &s;everal
<PB N="72" REF="72">parts thereof, would then undergo an ample and rational di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, freed from the language of par|liamentary di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>But in all deliberations of this kind, though men have a right to rea&s;on with, and endeavour to con|vince each other, upon any matter that re&s;pects their common good, yet, in point of practice, the majority of opinions, when known, forms a rule for the whole, and to this rule every good citizen prac|tically conforms.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, as if he knew, (for every concealed Pen&s;ioner has the opportunity of knowing) that the abu&s;es acted under the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, are two fla|grant to be palliated, and that the majority of opi|nions, whenever &s;uch abu&s;es &s;hould be made pub|lic, would be for a general and effectual reform, has endeavoured to preclude the event, by &s;turdily denying the right of a majority of a nation to act as a whole. Let us be&s;tow a thought upon this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>When any matter is propo&s;ed as a &s;ubject for con&s;ultation, it nece&s;&s;arily implies &s;ome mode of deci&s;ion. Common con&s;ent, ari&s;ing from ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, has placed this in a majority of opinions; becau&s;e without it there can be no deci&s;ion, and con&s;equently no order. It is, perhaps, the only ca&s;e in which mankind, however various in their ideas upon other matters, can con&s;i&s;tently be unanimous; becau&s;e it is a mode of deci&s;ion derived from the
<PB N="73" REF="73">primary original right of every individual concern|ed; <HI>that</HI> right being fir&s;t individually excerci&s;ed in giving an opinion, and whether that opinion &s;hall arrange with the minority or the majority, is a &s;ub|&s;equent accidental thing that neither increa&s;es nor dimini&s;hes the individual original right it&s;elf. Prior to any debate, enquiry or ve&s;tigation, it is not &s;up|po&s;ed to be known on which &s;ide the majority of opinions will fall, and therefore whil&s;t this mode of deci&s;ion &s;ecures to every one the right of giving an opinion, it admits to every one an equal chance in the ultimate event.</P>
<P>Among the matters that will pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the con&s;ideration of a National Convention, there is one, wholly of a dome&s;tic nature, but, &s;o marvelou&s;ly loaded with confu&s;ion, as to appear, at fir&s;t &s;ight, almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to be reformed. I mean the condition of what is called Law.</P>
<P>But, if we examine into the cau&s;e from whence this confu&s;ion, now &s;o much the &s;ubject of univer|&s;al complaint, is produced, not only the remedy will immediately pre&s;ent it&s;elf, but with it, the means of preventing the like ca&s;e hereafter.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, the confu&s;ion has generated it|&s;elf from the ab&s;urdity of every Parliament a&s;&s;um|ing to be eternal in power, and the laws partake in a &s;imiliar manner of this a&s;&s;umption. They have no period of legal or natural expiration; and, however ab&s;urd in principle, or incon&s;i&s;tent in practice many of them have become, they &s;till are, if not e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="74" REF="74">repealed, con&s;idered as making a part of the general ma&s;s. By this means the body of what is called Law, is &s;pread over a &s;pace of <HI>&s;everal hun|dred years,</HI> comprehending laws ob&s;olete, laws re|pugnant, laws ridiculous, and every other kind of laws forgotten or remembered; and what renders the ca&s;e &s;till wor&s;e is, that the confu&s;ion multiplies with the progre&s;s of time. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the time of Henry the Fourth, a law was pa&s;&s;ed, mak|ing it felony <Q>to multiply gold or &s;ilver, or to make u&s;e of the cru&s;t or multiplication,</Q> and this law remained two hundred and eighty-&s;ix years upon the &s;tatute books. It was then re|peated as being ridiculous and injurious.</NOTE></P>
<P>To bring this mi&s;shapen mon&s;ter into form, and to prevent its lap&s;ing again into a wilderne&s;s &s;tate, only two things, and tho&s;e very &s;imple, are ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, to review the whole ma&s;s of laws, and to bring forward &s;uch only as are worth retaining, and let all the re&s;t drop; and to give to the laws &s;o brought forward a new era commencing from the time of &s;uch reform.</P>
<P>Secondly, that at the expiration of every twenty-one years, (or any other &s;tated period) a like review &s;hall again be taken, and the laws found proper to be retained, be again carried forward, commencing with that date, and the u&s;ele&s;s laws dropt and di&s;con|tinued. By this means there can be no ob&s;olete laws, and &s;carcely &s;uch a thing as laws &s;tanding in direct or equivocal contradiction to each other, and
<PB N="75" REF="75">every per&s;on will know the period of time to which he is to look back for all the laws in being.</P>
<P>It is worth remarking, that whil&s;t every other branch of &s;cience is brought within &s;ome commo|dious &s;y&s;tem, and the &s;tudy of it &s;implified by ea&s;y methods, the laws take the contrary cour&s;e, and be|come every year more complicated, entangled, con|fu&s;ed, and ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>Among the paragraphs which the Attorney Ge|neral has taken from the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and put into his information, one is, that were I have &s;aid, <Q>that with re&s;pect to regular law, there is <HI>&s;carcely &s;uch a thing.</HI></Q></P>
<P>As I do not know whether the Attorney-General means to &s;hew this expre&s;&s;ion to be libellous, be|cau&s;e it is TRUE, or becau&s;e it is FALSE, I &s;hall make no other reply to him in this place than by remark|ing, that if almanack makers had not been more ju|dicious than law-makers, the &s;tudy of almanacks would by this time have become as ab&s;tru&s;e as the &s;tudy of law, and we &s;hould hear of a library of al|manacks as we now do of &s;tatutes; but by the &s;im|ple operation of letting the ob&s;olete matter drop, and carrying forward that only which is proper to be retained, all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be known, is found within the &s;pace of a year, and laws al&s;o ad|mit of being kept within &s;ome given period.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here clo&s;e this letter, &s;o far as it re&s;pects the Addre&s;&s;ers, the Proclamation, and the Pro&s;ecu|tion; and &s;hall offer a few ob&s;ervations to the
<PB N="76" REF="76">Society &s;tiling it&s;elf <Q>THE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE.</Q></P>
<P>That the &s;cience of government is beginning to be better under&s;tood than in former times, and that the age of fiction and political &s;uper&s;tition, and of craft and my&s;tery is pa&s;&s;ing away, are matters which the experience of every day proves to be true, as well in England as in other countries.</P>
<P>As therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible to calculate the &s;ilent progre&s;s of opinion, and al&s;o impo&s;&s;ible to govern a nation after it has changed its habits of thinking, by the craft or policy that it was governed by be|fore; the only true method to prevent popular di&s;|contents and commotions is, to throw, by every fair and rational argument, all the light upon the &s;ubject that can po&s;&s;ibly be thrown; and, at the &s;ame time, to open the means of collecting the general &s;en&s;e of the nation; and this cannot, as already ob&s;erved, be done by any plan &s;o effectually as a National Con|vention. Here individual opinion will quiet it&s;elf by having a centre to re&s;t upon.</P>
<P>The &s;ociety already mentioned, (which is made up of men of various de&s;criptions, but chiefly of tho&s;e called Foxites,) appears to me, either to have taken wrong grounds from want of judgment, or to have acted with cunning re&s;erve. It is now amu&s;ing the people with a new phra&s;e, namely, that of <Q>a tempe|rate and moderate reform,</Q> the interpretation of which is, <HI>a continuance of the abu&s;es as long as po&s;&s;ible. If we cannot hold all lot us hold &s;ome.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="77">Who are tho&s;e that are frightened at reforms? Are the public afraid that their taxes &s;hould be le&s;|&s;ened too much? Are they afraid that &s;inecure places and pen&s;ions &s;hould be aboli&s;hed too fa&s;t? Are the poor afraid that their condition &s;hould be rendered too comfortable? Is the worn-out mechanic, or the aged and decayed trade&s;man, frightened at the pro|&s;pect of receiving ten pounds a year out of the &s;ur|plus taxes? Is the &s;oldier frightened at the thoughts of his di&s;charge, and three &s;hillings per week during life? Is the &s;ailor afraid that pre&s;s-warrants will be aboli&s;hed? The Society mi&s;takes the fears of bo|rough-mongers, placemen, and pen&s;ioners, for the fears of the people; and the <HI>temperate and moderate Reform</HI> it talks of, is calculated to &s;uit the condition of the former.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e words, "temperate and moderate," are words either of political cowardice, or of cunning, or &s;eduction.&mdash;A thing, moderately good, is not &s;o good as it ought to be. Moderation in temper is always a virtue; but moderation in principle is a &s;pecies of vice. But who is to be the judge of what is a temperate and moderate Reform? The Society is the repre&s;entative of nobody; neither can the un|repre&s;ented part of the nation commit this power to tho&s;e in Parliament, in who&s;e election they had no choice; and, therefore, even upon the ground the Society has taken, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to a Na|tional Convention.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="78">The objection which Mr. Fox made to Mr. Grey's propo&s;ed Motion for a Parliamentary Reform was, that it contained no plan.&mdash;It certainly did not. But the plan very ea&s;ily pre&s;ents it&s;elf; and whil&s;t it is fair for all parties, it prevents the dangers that might otherwi&s;e ari&s;e from private or popular di&s;|content.</P>
