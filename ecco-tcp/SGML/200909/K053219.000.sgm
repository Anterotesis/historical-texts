<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>TO</HI> My Dearly Beloved in Chri&s;t, The <HI>CITIZENS</HI> of <HI>LONDON,</HI> with all that bear a Good Will to that <HI>CITY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Great and Dreadful God hath been pleading with poor <HI>England</HI> in the&s;e la&s;t Years, in &s;uch a manner as is &s;carce to be paralell'd in foregoing Ages: He hath left the Print of his Fingers behind him, and written Di|vine Di&s;plea&s;ure in Letters of Blood. The Righteous Judge began his Circuit the la&s;t Year in <HI>London,</HI> and in that one City above one hundred thou&s;and re|ceived the Sentence of Death from his ju&s;t Tribunal. He hath not yet ended his di&s;mal Circuit, but he ri|deth &s;till from one Shire to another, and doth not only keep his A&s;&s;izes in one or two Places in a Coun|ty, but he vi&s;its mo&s;t of their Market-Towns, and &s;ome &s;maller Villages al&s;o; doing terrible things in Righteou&s;ne&s;s among&s;t them. The Wound was &s;carce healed in the City, the Plague not quite re|moved, before another amazing Judgment is &s;ent to &s;ucceed in the Place of it: God doth again break forth upon poor <HI>London</HI> in greater Fury &s;till, plead|ing
<PB REF="3">his Cau&s;e with us in a lamentable Fire, which in a few Days &s;pace, hath turned one of the mo&s;t glorious Cities in the World to A&s;hes. The Voice of the Sword was not heard; the Language of the Plague was not under&s;tood; wherefore the dreadful <HI>Jehovah</HI> &s;peaks louder and louder &s;till. He hath now &s;poke as he did once from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> in Fire, Flames, and Smoak, and in the thundring Crack|ings of falling Hou&s;es, Churches, Halls, and &s;tately Buildings; in the Howlings, Skreekings, and dole|ful Outcries of poor Creatures, that were almo&s;t at their Wits end. He rode upon the Wings of the Wind, he rode in a Chariot of flaming Fire; nei|ther Bricks nor Stones can hinder his Cour&s;e, but the Fury of the Lord drove over them all; at who&s;e Pre|&s;ence, the Rocks are thrown down, and torn to pieces. The Bells did ring their own Knells as they were tumbling; and it's to be feared, were more mel|ted at the Anger of the mighty God, than thou&s;ands of hard-hearted Men and Women were: The Leads of the Churches were di&s;&s;olved into Showers, more ea&s;ily by far, than &s;tupid Profe&s;&s;ors that were wont to &s;it under them. That was a black Cloud indeed which no Wind could blow over, till it fell in &s;uch &s;calding Drops! How few of tho&s;e that were eating and drinking, and roaring but the Day before, dream|ed that &s;uch a Storm &s;hould ri&s;e before the Morning, that would not be laid till it had turned &s;uch wicked Inhabitants out of their Seats, and made their Hou|&s;es a ruinous Heap? I believe if they that were fea&s;ting on <HI>Saturday,</HI> had fore&s;een what would have come to pa&s;s in one Week's time, they would have had but little Stomach to their Dainties. Whereas if Sinners would give any Credit to the Word of Truth, that doth more than once tell them, that when they are mo&s;t &s;ecure, u&s;ually they are neare&s;t the Danger. The old World were as merry and as jovial the Day before the Flood, as if no Evil were nigh them. The Men of <HI>Sodom</HI> little thought when
<PB REF="4">the Sun ro&s;e &s;o gloriou&s;ly in the Morning upon them, that it would, long before Evening, be &s;o dark a Night with them. And though the World hear of the&s;e things a hundred times, yet they will not take warning, but they will be as jocund and chearful within a few Weeks of Eternity, as though all were very well with them. But alas, alas, poor Crea|tures! How mi&s;erably is the Ca&s;e altered with them, when they &s;ee their Mi&s;take in another World; then they will cry out that they had little Cau&s;e to be &s;o merry; and that Tears and Groans had much bet|ter become Per&s;ons in their State than Mirth and Jollity. O that poor Sinners would learn Wi&s;dom by fairer Means! O that they might not be taught by Scorpions, Flames, and Burnings; when the mer|ciful God is &s;o loath to take &s;uch a &s;evere Cour&s;e, if any thing le&s;s would do the Work: But if Sinners will per&s;i&s;t in their ob&s;tinate Rebellions again&s;t God, and will not be reclaimed by le&s;&s;er Judgments, they mu&s;t expect a greater &s;till; God will make the prou|de&s;t, fir&s;t or la&s;t, to bow or fall, to bend or break, to turn or burn. They which will not hear one Judgment, &s;hall before it be long feel another. If the Sword can't be heard, the Plague &s;hall; if nei|ther the Sword nor the Plague, the Fire &s;hall: If none of the&s;e, God hath his Trea&s;uries of Wrath, and can plague us yet &s;even times more for our Sins. O &s;tupid Creatures that we are, when &s;hall we hear the Rod and him that hath appointed it! What! do all the&s;e things come by chance? Was there no|thing of God in that Plague? Nor in the&s;e Flames? When was &s;uch a Fire heard of, that was not kind|led by the Coals of his Jealou&s;y? I will not &s;ay but there was abundance of the Policy and Malice of Hell in this Bu&s;ine&s;s; but I will affirm this, that had not our Sins exceedingly kindled the Wrath of God again&s;t us fir&s;t, this devili&s;h Popi&s;h Plot &s;hould have proved as abortive as &s;ome of the former; had not our Wickedne&s;s made our City more combu&s;tible
<PB REF="5">than Briers and Thorns, the Je&s;uite &s;hould with more Ea&s;e have &s;et the Sea on Fire, and dried up the va&s;t Ocean, or pull'd the Sun out of the Firmament, than to have laid <HI>London</HI> in the Du&s;t. If there were no|thing of God in this Fire, why was it not as ea&s;ily quenched as other Fires have been? What meant that unheard of Stupidne&s;s that was upon the Spirits of the Magi&s;trates? How came it to pa&s;s that the mo&s;t probable Means to &s;uppre&s;s its Rage, &s;hould not be made u&s;e of? Whence came that great Wind that did like a Pair of mighty Bellows, give a double Strength to tho&s;e greedy Flames? Whence was it that there was &s;uch a general Con|&s;ternation of Spirit, that Men &s;hould &s;o forget their Work, and run away, and leave the City to the Mercy of the Fire? I might add a more &s;ignificant Token of Divine Retaliation than all the&s;e, but I wave that, becau&s;e he that runs may read it. All the Circum&s;tances of this Fire &s;peak aloud, Anger, Di&s;plea&s;ure, Judgement.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e three angry Heraulds, the <HI>Bla&s;ing Stars</HI> I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, proclaimed War with <HI>England,</HI> from the ju&s;t <HI>Jehovah,</HI> who would not put up &s;uch daring Affronts as were offered him by the Inhabitants of this King|dom, without taking notice of them. If ever God's Dealings with a People &s;peak any thing of Di&s;plea|&s;ure, then tho&s;e that <HI>England</HI> hath been exerci&s;ed with, do: All his dreadful Providences toward us do read their Commi&s;&s;ion, from a holy, ju&s;t, and angry God. But if all that hath been &s;aid &s;peak no|thing to the convincing of us, that God him&s;elf had the chief Hand in the&s;e things; if they all &s;eem but humane Conjectures, I pray hear what God him&s;elf &s;peaks, <HI>Amos</HI> 3.6. <HI>Shall there be Evil in a City, and God hath not done it?</HI> The Lord takes it as a very great Indignity, not to have the Operation of his Hands regarded; not to have his Judgments taken notice of, as coming from him&s;elf; and a hundred to one but they are near a &s;econd, who are not &s;en|&s;ible
<PB REF="6">of the fir&s;t; and they near a third, who wild not be warned by the fir&s;t and &s;econd.</P>
<P>Our next Enquiry &s;hall be, wherefore God doth thus contend with us. Such Judgments as the&s;e are, never come only to try the People of God's Patience. No: Such great Judgments &s;peak great Sins; and &s;ometimes God writes the Sin in the Forehead of the Puni&s;hment: Will it not therefore be our great Con|cern, to find out what may be the Cau&s;e of this fiery Di&s;plea&s;ure. Truly we need not &s;earch long to find the cur&s;ed Traytor, that had the chief Hand in this Bu&s;ine&s;s. You are all ready to ask the &s;ame Que&s;ti|on, which <HI>Aha&s;huerus,</HI> did <HI>E&s;ther, Who is he, and where is he that dur&s;t pre&s;ume in his Heart to have any thing to do in &s;o devili&s;h a matter?</HI> I an&s;wer as &s;he did; <HI>The Adver&s;ary and Enemy is thy wicked Heart:</HI> Have you never read, <HI>That Wickedne&s;s burns like Fire?</HI> I&s;a. 9.18. That Sin which we make &s;o much of, that Lu&s;t which we hug in our Bo&s;oms, that <HI>Dalilah</HI> which we do &s;o oft imbrace, hath done us all this Mi&s;chief: 'Tis Sin that is the only procuring Cau&s;e of Judgment. Holine&s;s may &s;et Men again&s;t us. It's nothing but Wickedne&s;s that can &s;et God again&s;t us. Thine own Wickedne&s;s, O <HI>England,</HI> hath corrected thee, and thine own Back&s;lidings have reproved thee: <HI>Know therefore and &s;ee, that it is an evil thing and bit|ter, that thou ha&s;t for&s;aken the Lord thy God, and that my Fear is not in thee, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> There is never a Sinner in <HI>England</HI> but carrieth a Wild|fire about with him to do Mi&s;chief with it: The be&s;t natur'd unconverted Man that lives, what&s;oever fine Name he may be called by, is no better than a Mad|man, that ca&s;teth abroad Fire-brands, Arrows, and Death; and yet he &s;aith he meant no harm, he is but in &s;port. O that fooli&s;h Sinners &s;hould find out &s;uch dangerous things to play with! And &s;uch is his Fol|ly &s;till, that when he hath &s;et his Body, his Soul, his Relations, his E&s;tate, his Hou&s;e, and his Neighbours too on fire; he makes a great Outcry, Fire! Fire!
<PB REF="7">Where did it begin? Who was that carele&s;s Wretch by who&s;e Neglect it fir&s;t came? Could there be &s;uch a barbarous unmerciful Mon&s;ter on this &s;ide Hell that would do &s;uch a thing? Could any Man living have the lea&s;t Hand in &s;o helli&s;h an Act? Yes. How! Bring out that&mdash;(I know not what to call him bad enough) that we may tear him in pieces, we'll knock out his Brains, we'll &s;end him to Hell, where he &s;hall have Fire enough, if Fire be &s;o good for him; a hundred Deaths are too little for him: O that I had him here (&s;aith the furious Sinner) I would &s;oon have the Heart-blood of him! Who now would i|magine that a Fellow that talks at this rate &s;hould be the Man, that was Head and Heart deep in this fi|ring Work? Whereas if the Man were thorowly &s;earched, you might find abundance of &s;ulphurous Stuff about him; and if one &s;hould follow him from place to place, he might find that he &s;eldom cometh into any Place, but he leaveth &s;ome Brim&s;tone, Gunpowder, and a lighted Match, in &s;ome &s;ecret Corner behind him.</P>
<P>But general Accu&s;ations are no Accu&s;ations, wherefore I &s;hall de&s;cend to a few Particulars, and name &s;ome of tho&s;e fiery Sins, which, it's more than po&s;&s;ible, have made poor <HI>England</HI> like Stubble and Tinder; and have turned our Capitol City into A&s;hes. And, O that all the Tribes of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> would &s;et them&s;elves before the Lord, and make a diligent Enquiry after tho&s;e accur&s;ed <HI>Achans,</HI> tho&s;e God-provoking Sins, which have been the Troublers of <HI>London!</HI> O that we could re&s;olve their Death, though they be never &s;o dear to us: My meaning is, O that upon the Di&s;covery of the Sin that hath kind|led the Wrath of God, and cau&s;ed him to break out upon us in &s;uch flery Indignation, we could in good earne&s;t labour the mortifying of it, as we would en|deavour to &s;ee Execution done upon the vile&s;t Trai|tor in the World. What &s;ay you Citizens? Will you promi&s;e that you will to the uttermo&s;t of your
<PB REF="8">Power, and with the Strength of your Souls, oppo&s;e tho&s;e Sins which have done you &s;o much wrong? And becau&s;e you are weak, and they are mighty ones, will you call in the Help of the Almighty a|gain&s;t &s;o wicked an Enemy? In hope of this I &s;hall proceed in the Search, and as I go along, as you would not have to do with Fire again, as you value your own eternal Safety, Riches, and Peace; as you would not be harbourle&s;s when your Hou&s;e of Clay &s;hall be pulled down; as you de&s;ire to have a <HI>Hou&s;e not made with Hands,</HI> and to live for ever <HI>in the New Jeru&s;alem,</HI> be faithful in the Examination of your own Souls; and if you find them guilty, arraign, condemn, and crucify that great Malefactor.</P>
<P>What do you think of the Fire of Lu&s;t and Un|cleanne&s;s? Will not that burn Kingdoms, Coun|tries and Cities, as well as the Bones, Marrow and Strength? <HI>London</HI> is not the fir&s;t City that hath been turned into A&s;hes by that burning Sin. O how hath this Sin reigned in <HI>London!</HI> How many thou&s;ands of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s &s;trange Women were there, not in Cor|ners only, but in their Shops (as I may call them) whole Streets &s;tanding in the Attire of Harlots; (I would to God my Informers were mi&s;taken.) It would make a Chri&s;tians Heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake to hear what Narratives &s;ome have made of the&s;e things, who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion hath given them too clear Demon&s;tration of the Truth of what they &s;pake. How many of the Citizens Wives them&s;elves have given under|&s;tanding mode&s;t Per&s;ons cau&s;e of Su&s;picion, that they have not been the lea&s;t guilty in this burning Sin? Nay, how many of them which look very &s;oberly, and go for Religious Per&s;ons, have taken the&s;e Coals into their Bo&s;oms? May not God ju&s;tly take up the &s;ame Complaint again&s;t &s;ome of the Inhabitants of this City, as he did once again&s;t <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> that <HI>when he hath fed them to the Full; they then committed Adultery, and a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves together by Troops in Harlots Hou&s;es; and that they were as fed Hor&s;es in
<PB REF="9">the Morning; every one neighed after his Neighbour's Wife. Shall I not vi&s;it for the&s;e things?</HI> Wherefore &s;aith the Lord to his Servant <HI>Jeremiah, I will make my Words in thy Mouth Fire, and this People Wood, and it &s;hall devour them,</HI> Jer. 5.7, 8, 9, 14. O that the Hand of &s;ome of our great Ones were not chief in this Matter! O what dreadful daring Sins of this Nature have been done in the Sight of the Sun! Have not &s;ome of our young <HI>Ab&s;aloms,</HI> even, as it were, &s;pread their Tents to commit Folly in the Face of the whole City, as if Fornication alone were too lit|tle to &s;ink them into Hell, except joined with Sodo|my and horrible Bla&s;phemy; how have they added one to another? And then rejoyced, as if it were an Honour to be a Devil incarnate, and an high Piece of Gallantry to bid Defiance to the Almighty. Pa&s;s over the <HI>I&s;les</HI> of <HI>Chittim,</HI> and &s;ee, go to <HI>Kedar</HI> and con&s;ider: Was there ever greater Sins in <HI>Sodom,</HI> or more prodigious Wickedne&s;s heard of in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Italy?</HI> Not only Fornication, but Adultery goes now for a venial Fault, a <HI>Peccadillo:</HI> And &s;o impudent are &s;ome grown in their Sin, that they make but a laughing Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch foul Abominations as the&s;e. O un&s;peakable Madne&s;s! What! is there le&s;s Dan|ger in this Sin now than there was in former times? Shall that Wickedne&s;s which once a&s;cended up to Heaven in a black Cloud, and fell down again in Showers of Fire and Brim&s;tone upon <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> &s;eem to us but Vapours that will quickly vani&s;h? Why &s;hould not the Sin of Uncleanne&s;s burn <HI>London,</HI> as well as the Cities of the Plain? Is God le&s;s offended with Sin than he was then? Is not God as holy, ju&s;t, and powerful now as ever? Is his Hand weaker now than ever? No &s;uch matter Sin|ners; Sin hath &s;till its old Nature; and if there be any Difference it's now of a deeper Dye, as being committed again&s;t incomparably greater Light. Wherefore deceive not your &s;elves, if God condemned Whoremongers and Adulterers then, they are not
<PB REF="10" MS="y">like to be acquitted now, if they die in that Sin; and let me add this, that that is a Sin that is &s;eldom tru|ly repented of. O that tho&s;e bruti&s;h Sinners would but &s;eriou&s;ly ponder the&s;e two or three Scriptures, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.4. <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.8. <HI>Prov.</HI> 6.26. <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> 5.5, 6. <HI>Jude,</HI> ver. 7.</P>
<P N="2">2. What do you think of fiery Spirits, who if it lay in their Power would turn all to A&s;hes that are not as furious as them&s;elves? How many are there in <HI>England,</HI> that would be glad with all their Souls to be at this burning Work again? We can't yet for|get the <HI>Marian Days,</HI> tho&s;e black and di&s;mal Days, wherein in was an high Crime to de&s;ire the Light; wherein poor Creatures mu&s;t go hood-winked to Hell, or to Heaven in a Flame. We can't let that <HI>Powder-plot</HI> &s;lip out of our Minds, though &s;ome of <HI>Rome</HI>'s Friends could be contented that the Memory of it &s;hould quite be quenched, and tho&s;e Je&s;uitical Incendiaries &s;hould be received into our Embraces. Nay, we can't but &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect that that helli&s;h <HI>Cabal,</HI> had their Heads and Hands, as well as their Hearts in the fireing of <HI>London.</HI> The&s;e, the&s;e are the Per&s;ons that have always traded much with Fire and Blood; and we can &s;carce think that &s;o many of them as were in <HI>London,</HI> have been altogether idle. Who is it that hath rent and torn us into &s;o many pieces? Who is it that foments our Divi&s;ions? He mu&s;t be blind that &s;ees not the Hand of the Je&s;uite in all the&s;e. And are there none we call Pro|te&s;tants, that forget what Spirit it is which acteth them, while they are &s;o implacable again&s;t tho&s;e which they &s;hould love as Brethren, and not &s;pare to lay down their Lives for them, if called to it. O where is the &s;weet Spirit that was among&s;t Chri&s;tians in the Primitive Times? Did the Commands of our great Ma&s;ter bind none but his Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ci|ples? Did that Law of Love continue in force only for an Age or two? Doth it &s;ignify nothing with us, that Chri&s;t did &s;o highly commend this Duty of <HI>loving
<PB REF="11">one another? O England, England,</HI> when will thy bitter Heart-burnings be cooled! I &s;peak to the hot Spirits of <HI>England.</HI> Do you think that he which con|demned <HI>James</HI> and <HI>John</HI> when they would have been at this fiery Work, will commend you for imitating of them? Is this forgiving of Enemies? Is this pray|ing for them that per&s;ecute us? Is this ble&s;&s;ing them that cur&s;e us? What is that which we &s;o earne&s;tly contend for? Is it the Faith once delivered to the Saints? Is it, who &s;hould love one another mo&s;t? What is it that we labour &s;o much for? Is it to pluck Firebrands out of the Fire? To quench the Flames of Hell that are ready to &s;eize upon Chri&s;t-de&s;pi&s;ing Sin|ners? When God hath &s;ent us into his Vineyard to work, do not many of us play, or &s;leep, or that which is wor&s;e, make u&s;e of tho&s;e Tools which God hath given us to work with, to fight withal, and to beat our Fellow-Servants? If any be angry at what I &s;ay, I mu&s;t add this one Word more to him; I am &s;ure he is guilty. Let me in &s;ober Sadne&s;s expo&s;tu|late the Ca&s;e with thee, before thou let fly too vio|lently; let me ask this hot &s;pirited fiery Creature, Are you &s;ure your Zeal is according to Knowledge? Are you certain the things you are &s;o hot about are the weighty things of the Law? Are they as nece&s;&s;a|ry as the Salvation of Mens Souls? Are you &s;ure they are the grand Fundamentals, without which it is im|po&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape everla&s;ting Wrath? If &s;o, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I blame thee not? Dare you &s;ay that tho&s;e that you are &s;o fiery again&s;t, are all in a damnable State? If they were, they have the more need of your Pity, and compa&s;&s;ionate Endeavours to convince them of their Mi&s;ery: But what if tho&s;e which you &s;o madly breath out Threatnings again&s;t, be the Chil|dren of God? I tell you, I would not be found guilty of <HI>offending one of tho&s;e little ones</HI> for all that you are worth, if it were ten thou&s;and times more than it is. Do you think that <HI>their Father doth not &s;ee?</HI> Or do you think that the God of Love, which hath made it
<PB REF="12">your Duty to love your Children, hath none for his? Or do you hope to make your Party good with him, and them too? If this be your Mind, I know what will become of the Stoute&s;t of you all &s;hortly. Do you never look into the Bible, O ye fiery ones, which make nothing of &s;miting with the Tongue! Did you never read the fir&s;t Chapter of the Second Epi&s;tle of <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians?</HI> There you may find what Wages you &s;hall have for &s;uch Work, what Recom|pence for &s;uch Service. Who is it, that the Lord Je&s;us will give Re&s;t to? And who is that he will take Vengeance of in flaming Fire? When you intend next to trouble any of tho&s;e that are dear to Chri&s;t, read and &s;tudy that Chapter, and then as you like Fire and Flanies go on in your Work. When you are envying again&s;t your Chri&s;tian Brethren, then before you be too hot turn to <HI>Jude</HI> 14.15. Re|member that hard Speeches &s;hall be puni&s;hed with no ea&s;y Judgment. Con&s;ider how the Great In|dictment runs, <HI>Matt.</HI> 25. It may be you may think that as to the main Thing, <HI>Religion,</HI> you are &s;afe e|nough; but did you never hear that it's more than po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a one's Religion is but a &s;eeming vain Religion, who bridles not his Tongue, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1. 26. What do you &s;ay to the&s;e Scriptures, O ye hot ones! Do you well con&s;ider what Fire warms you? And what Furnace tho&s;e Coals mu&s;t glow in for e|ver? Your fiery Tongues will &s;hortly be &s;corched in &s;uch Flames, as that they will roar out for a Drop of Water to cool them. <HI>What &s;hall be given unto thee, or what &s;hall be done unto thee, thou fal&s;e Tongue? Sharp Arrows of the Mighty, with Coals of Juniper.</HI> O when &s;hall the&s;e unnatural Heats be abated! I &s;peak all this to violent ones of all Per&s;wa&s;ions &s;oever: And I &s;ay again, I am &s;ure none but the Guilty will be offended; but I fear the Fire burns on every &s;ide &s;o terribly, that the&s;e few Drops will do little to the quenching of it; but however, who can choo&s;e but draw Water that knows what precious things are
<PB REF="13">near the Burning? Who can forbear pulling away &s;ome of the Fuel, that under&s;tands how dreadful the Fire may be if it burn a while longer. I am the lar|ger upon this, becau&s;e this great Sin hath already been burning many Years; and hath mi&s;erably weakened us, and is now of more dangerous Con|&s;equence than ever. Is it not enough, <HI>England,</HI> that thou art compa&s;&s;ed about with Flames, but that thou mu&s;t be &s;till kindling Fires, gathering Fuel, and blowing it up, and that even in thy own Bowels? Is this a time for Engli&s;hmen, for Chri&s;tians, for Pro|te&s;tants to be ready to tear one another's Throats out? Wo is me that I dwell among them that are &s;et on Fire! <HI>Wo is me that I &s;ojourn in</HI> Me&s;ech, <HI>that I dwell in the Tents of</HI> Kedar! <HI>My Soul hath long dwelt with them that hate Peace. I am for Peace, but when I &s;peak, they are for War,</HI> P&s;al. 120. Shall nothing make us lay a&s;ide our unnatural Feuds? Wo, wo to tho&s;e which are &s;o far from quenching this Fire, that they &s;till labour to make it burn more furiou&s;ly: It may be that Fire which now warms them, may one Day burn them. This fiery Sin al&s;o hath not had the lea&s;t Hand in burning <HI>London</HI> to A&s;hes. And what &s;aye&s;t thou, O Sinner, to this Indictment, guilty, or not guilty? <HI>O ble&s;&s;ed are the Meek!</HI> But if thou art guilty, run &s;peedily to the great Conduit, the Fountain, and fill thy Bucket, and pour, pour abundance of Water upon this Fire; nay, upon the very Smoak: Thoa little thinke&s;t what it will el&s;e come to at la&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hath there not been a &s;trange Coldne&s;s and In|differency in the Things of God? And &s;ince preach|ing would not warm us, God will try whether the Fire will: While we heard of the un&s;earchable Ri|ches of Chri&s;t, which &s;hould have thawed our Hearts, and turned them into a Flame of Love, we were as cold and as lifele&s;s as if the Tenders of a Chri&s;t to the lo&s;t Sons of <HI>Adam</HI> were no &s;uch great Mercy, and the Go&s;pel of Reconciliation but an incon&s;iderable
<PB REF="14">Kindne&s;s. While we heard the Sons of Thunder, our Souls were not rent; while the Flames of Hell have been &s;et forth warmly, we have been as little affected as if the Fire of that burning Pit, were but a painted Fire, and the Torments of the Damned a politick Fable to &s;care Men into Civility. While we have heard of the Day of Judgment &s;o oft, and have not &s;een it, we are almo&s;t of the Mind, that things will always be as they are; and are ready to think, that becau&s;e God &s;tays long, therefore he will never come. But hold there Sinner, that would be good News indeed to thee; but flatter not your &s;elves &s;o; God will e're long convince you by an undenia|ble Argument, that Heaven, Hell, and Eternity are the greate&s;t Realities in the World; and that God's Judgment and Damnation are not things to be je&s;ted with. Some of us have been ready to talk in our Hearts, as tho&s;e <HI>Athei&s;ts</HI> did with their Tongues, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 5.19. <HI>Let him make &s;peed and ha&s;ten his Work, that we may &s;ee it.</HI> And now God hath an&s;wered that Re|que&s;t with a Vengeance. Faith would not &s;ee, and therefore Sen&s;e &s;hall. God hath let the Sins of <HI>Lon|don</HI> &s;ee a little Emblem of the Day of Judgment; He came like a Thief in the Night, he came irre&s;i&s;ti|bly and dreadfully, and in a little &s;pace hath de|&s;poiled us of our Glory, and filled our Hearts with Horror, and our Souls with A&s;toni&s;hment; and if we continue &s;till our old <HI>Luke-warmne&s;s,</HI> we may be vi&s;ited with new <HI>heating Judgments</HI> &s;till. But &s;ome will &s;ay, what do I mean to reckon this among&s;t the God-provoking Sins? When was there ever more praying? When more of the outward Acts of Reli|gion? What Fa&s;ting? How many Solemn A&s;&s;em|blies?</P>
<P>Did not <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI> do as much as we, think you, when God laid their Country de&s;olate, and burnt their Cities with Fire, and &s;courged them with one Judgment after another, till he was ready to throw away his Rod, and give them up as utterly incorrigi|ble?
<PB REF="15">Read but the fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> and you &s;hall find that at that very time they made as glori|ous a Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion as any People in the World. They li&s;ted up their Hands with a great deal of &s;eeming Devotion, they made many Prayers, and they hung down their Heads for a while like Bullru&s;hes, and as to the external Part of Religion &s;eemed to be a People that delighted in God; and yet you &s;ee how exceedingly the Lord undervalued all that they did. Why, what was the matter that the Lord takes no more notice of them, than if they were the vile&s;t Wretches on this &s;ide Hell? And calls them by a Name which &s;poke no le&s;s, <HI>Men of</HI> Sodom, <HI>and Inhabitants of</HI> Gomorrah. Why, the rea&s;on was, becau&s;e they play'd the Hypocrites &s;o abominably; while their Tongues were as hot as could be, their Hearts were as cold as Stones; while they &s;acrificed the Bea&s;t to God, they devoted their Life and Love to their Lu&s;ts; and the Sum of all their Religion was, to tell God they were Sinners, and to de&s;ire that he would give them leave to be &s;o &s;till, and af|ter they had &s;in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed as long as they could, be&s;tow a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Happine&s;s and Glory upon them in another World that God would be plea&s;ed to accept the Shell, and let the Devil have the Kernel.

And if God &s;hould not be avenged on &s;uch a People as this, they would be confirmed in their Wickedne&s;s, and think that Holine&s;s it &s;elf approved of the greate&s;t Impieties. The Truth of it is, con&s;idering all things, it is a Miracle that our Condition is not far &s;ad|der than it is; it is a wonder that our Fire was not mingled with Brim&s;tone. Pride, Idlene&s;s, and Ful|ne&s;s of Bread, were the Sins of <HI>Sodom;</HI> and was <HI>Lon|don</HI> le&s;s guilty? May we not add Oppre&s;&s;ion, Fal&s;e|ne&s;s, Perjury, prodigious In&s;en&s;ibility of former Judgments? The Plague which &s;ell chiefly upon the Poor, began to be thought nothing by the Rich, tho' mo&s;t of them flew from it; and &s;ome of them were as merry in the Country, as if <HI>London</HI> ailed nothing: but now they al&s;o &s;hall feel what it is to lye under the Scourge: And they that would not abate any thing of their Pride and Luxury to keep others from &s;tarving, &s;hall do it now whether they will or not, to keep them&s;elves from it. They which would give but little to &s;upply the Exigencies of others when they had it, &s;hall now have but little to &s;upply their own. I tell you &s;ome of the faithful Mini&s;ters that &s;taid in the City, when they beheld the bruti&s;h Stupidne&s;s of the Generality of People, much feared another Judg|ment upon the Neck of the Plague. Was there not one more e&s;pecially, who declared him&s;elf thus in publick; <HI>O</HI> London, London! <HI>If thou do&s;t not re|pent, and reform in another kind of manner than thou h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t yet done, if God doth not &s;peedily &s;end another great and vi&s;ible Judgment upon thee, then the Lord hath not &s;poken this Day by me.

<PB REF="17"><HI>to &s;ee what a Storm is ready to fall upon our mi&s;erable rich ones, who are now fea&s;ting and faring de|liciou&s;ly every Day in the Country, whil&s;t we are ready to fami&s;h &s;ome of us, and dying by thou&s;ands in the City.</HI> So that we cannot &s;ay but that we had fair Warning. Should I go on &s;till to read God's Indictment again&s;t us, when &s;hould I have done? O where is that &s;weet Spirit that was once &s;tirring in <HI>London!</HI> Is not Religion in the Life of it almo&s;t out of fa&s;hion? Is it not laid a&s;ide as a Garb not becoming our pre&s;ent Times? But I believe before God hath done with us he will make us put it on again, as well as our old ca&s;t-away-Suits: O how have we for&s;aken our fir&s;t Love! O the dreadful Apo&s;tacy of &s;ome of our Hearts! O how little have tho&s;e of us that &s;hould have en|couraged Holine&s;s troubled our &s;elves with it, ex|cept to &s;uppre&s;s, brow-beat and oppo&s;e it. Hath it not been a &s;port to &s;ome in this City, to abute the Holy Scriptures, and tho&s;e that de&s;ired to go to Heaven by that Light. Who have been the Song of the Drunkard? What have the profane Wits made the great Subject of their &s;currilous Tongues, but &s;a|cred Things? As if it were the greate&s;t Credit to di&s;honour our Maker, and true Courage to de&s;pi&s;e the Laws and Power of an Almighty God. At what a high rate do the Devil's Champions act, as if they were afraid they could never do their Ma&s;ter Service enough, and after all &s;hould mi&s;s of his Company for ever. But never fear that Sinner; Hell may be had at a great deal cheaper rate. If you de&s;ire to be &s;o familiar with God's Judgment, Damning, and the Devil, it may be &s;ooner than you are aware you may have enough of them. Neither have we cau&s;e to cen&s;ure the Layety alone, as only guilty in the&s;e fiery Sins: The Ruins of the Churches, and the burning of the Pulpits, &s;peak tho&s;e which claim the greate&s;t Intere&s;t in both, not to be altogether inno|cent. Give me leave to lay my &s;elf and you in the
<PB REF="18">Du&s;t, O ye Mini&s;ters of <HI>England.</HI> Have we been in|deed true and faithful to the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t and Souls? Have we not minded the Fleece as much as the Flock? Have we taught the Word in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on? Have we been in Travail to &s;ee Chri&s;t formed in the Souls of our Hearers? Have we be&s;ought Sinners in Chri&s;t's &s;tead to be reconciled to God? Have we watched over Souls? Have we war|ned Sinners Night and Day with Tears? Have we taught them publickly, and from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e? Have we been like burning and &s;hining Lights? Hath the Honour of our great Ma&s;ter been our great|e&s;t De&s;ign? Have we laboured hard in God's Vine|yard, and in good earne&s;t prayed that God would &s;end more Labourers into his Harve&s;t? Have we preached by holy Lives and &s;ound Doctrine? This 'tis to be a Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ter. But hath this indeed been the Practice of the Mini&s;ters of <HI>England?</HI> Have we not rather given <HI>Campian</HI> and his Brethren the Je&s;uites cau&s;e to in&s;ult and &s;ay, <HI>Nihil eorum mi|ni&s;tris vilius?</HI> Have not abundance of us by our vile and abominable Lives expo&s;ed the Sacred Function, and cau&s;ed the Offerings of the Lord to be abhor|red? Have not our Actions &s;poke more for the De|vil, than our Tongues have done for Chri&s;t? Do not the common People begin almo&s;t to que&s;tion our Office, and look upon it as a Cheat? Are not they far more hardned by ourwicked, or unprofitable Con|ver&s;ation, than &s;oftned by our Preaching? Preach|ing did I &s;ay? Perhaps I might have put in another Word? For that was a Work that &s;ome of us trou|bled our &s;elves little enough with. And it's ob&s;er|ved by &s;ome, that we left our Pulpits and made them almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s, before God burnt them: And when we did preach, did we preach Chri&s;t, or our &s;elves? The Morali&s;t <HI>(Epic.)</HI> thought it a ridiculous thing to call two thou&s;and People together, to tell them that he was a good Scholar, in a <HI>Periphra&s;is</HI> of
<PB REF="19">two hours long; he tells us (though a Heathen) <HI>That it was God and Souls that he was to &s;peak for, and not him&s;elf.</HI> And &s;hall a Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ter, judge it greater Wi&s;dom wittily to commend him&s;elf, than warmly to commend Chri&s;t. <HI>Pudet haec opprobria nobis vel dici potui&s;&s;e, &amp; non potui&s;&s;e re|felli.</HI></P>
<P>I expect that tho&s;e which are mo&s;t guilty &s;hould lea&s;t reli&s;h this Accu&s;ation; but let me tell &s;uch, they have already more di&s;graced them&s;elves by acting, than I dare by &s;peaking; and as for tho&s;e that are not guilty, all this is nothing to them. The&s;e are no &s;ecret things, but &s;uch as the World rings of; and Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin, and Humiliation for them, and reforming of them, will be a &s;urer Guard to our Credit than our hiding them. I may &s;ay, &s;hall we be &s;o tender in the Matter of our Honour, and &s;hall not God's be at all vindicated? And if I may not cen&s;ure others, I hope you will give me leave to ac|cu&s;e my &s;elf: And for my part I had far rather judge my &s;elf here, than be judged hereafter.</P>
<P>Well now, is <HI>England</HI> guilty or not guilty? Is not <HI>London</HI> tried and ca&s;t? And &s;hall we not yet humble our &s;elves, and give Glory to the God of <HI>I&s;|rael?</HI> Shall we &s;till like <HI>Pharaoh</HI> harden our Hearts again&s;t all the&s;e Plagues?

O that it may purge away our Dro&s;s, and take away our Tin! O that like burnt Children we may for ever after dread the Fire! O that tho&s;e dreadful things which we have &s;een and heard, may engage us more deeply again&s;t Sin, which brought them all upon us! And let me tell you, this is nothing to the Mi&s;chief that Sin intends to do us if we look no better after it. O &s;hall we ea|&s;ily be reconciled to that which hath robbed us of &s;o many of our &s;weete&s;t Enjoyments, that hath &s;poiled
<PB REF="20">us of our Goods; which hath turned us out of our Hou&s;es, but with a little warning, and given them to our Servant, who will never re&s;tore them again, I mean the Fire. Shall we lodge that in our Bo&s;om which hath turned our beloved and beautiful City into A&s;hes? Shall we look upon that as no Enemy, which hath done us &s;uch a great deal of harm? Shall we again join in Affinity with that Prince of Darkne&s;s, who fir&s;t or la&s;t undoes all that have any thing to do with him, except to re&s;i&s;t him. Shall the Wrongs that this old Adver&s;ary hath done to poor <HI>London</HI> be revenged by a new Covenant with him? Is it a &s;mall Injury to di&s;mantle, rifle and burn &s;uch a City as <HI>London</HI> was? O that one Fire might kindle another! O that our Souls were in|flamed with Indignation again&s;t Sin! When Sa|tan &s;ollicits you next to Folly, then think of <HI>Eden, London</HI> and <HI>Golgotha;</HI> I mean the Injuries that Sin did you in all tho&s;e Places. Let me a little incen&s;e your Souls again&s;t that Enemy that we are ready &s;o &s;oon to receive into Favour. Was it not this E|nemy which ran without Pity the la&s;t Year from one end of the City to the other, and left in mo&s;t of our Hou&s;es one dead, in &s;ome &s;carce one living? It was this which fed the greedy Grave with &s;ome hun|dreds at a Meal. This, this tore our dear and pre|cious Relations out of our Embraces; and &s;hall we &s;till have as much Kindne&s;s for it as for the deare&s;t Friend in the World? I wonder how Sin and Satan came to de&s;erve &s;o well at our Hands, that we &s;hould prefer them both above all that we have in the World! O how hath the Devil bewitched poor Sin|ners, that they &s;hould rather part with their greate&s;t Friends, than the lea&s;t Sin! What good did Satan ever do us, that we &s;hould make &s;o much of his Brats! O de&s;perate Madne&s;s!

<PB REF="21">O that Sinners would believe once that Sin is none of their Friend, for all they are &s;o well acquainted with it. 'Tis this which laid our glorious City in the Du&s;t.

Re|pent in good earne&s;t, and thy God will yet look up|on thee, and rai&s;e thee out of the Du&s;t, and take thee off from the Dunghil, and thy Glory &s;hall be double to what it was. <HI>The Lord will lay thy Stones with fair Colours, he will lay thy Foundations with Saphires, he will make thy Windows of Agates, and thy Gates of Carbun|cles, and all thy Borders of plea&s;ant Stones; In Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;halt thou be e&s;tabli&s;hed, thou &s;halt be far from Op|pre&s;&s;ion, for thou &s;halt not fear; and from Terror, for it &s;hall not come near thee.</HI> Cry, cry mightily unto the Lord, ye that make mention of his Name, and give him no Re&s;t till he e&s;tabli&s;h the Glory of <HI>England,</HI> and make <HI>London</HI> a Prai&s;e in the whole Earth: For
<PB REF="24"><HI>London</HI>'s &s;ake I will not be &s;ilent, for our <HI>Zion</HI>'s &s;ake I will not hold my Peace: The Place of the Se|pulchres of my Fathers lies wa&s;t, the Place of my Na|tivity; the Sanctuary and Shelter of God's People lies de&s;olate. The City wherein &s;ometimes dwelt Righteou&s;ne&s;s, is fallen to the Ground! <HI>London</HI> is in A&s;hes! Chri&s;tians, how can you bare &s;uch a Sight without Tears! This is the Place where your Souls were &s;ometimes fed with Marrow and Fatne&s;s; Here thou&s;ands and thou&s;ands were born to God. Chri|&s;tians, can you forget the Place of your &s;piritual Na|tivity? Here you enjoyed &s;weet Communion with the Saints. For your Brethren and Kindreds &s;ake, let <HI>London</HI> lie near your Hearts! O pray, pray, pray for poor de&s;olate <HI>London!</HI> They &s;hall pro&s;per that love her. Remember <HI>London,</HI> O ye praying ones! You Favourites of Heaven, when you are in the King's Pre&s;ence, &s;peak a good Word for dear <HI>Lon|don!</HI> Remember her in your Fa&s;ts, forget her not in all your Addre&s;&s;es to God, but wre&s;tle with him for a Ble&s;&s;ing for her. O let us fall to Fa&s;ting, Prayer, and Reformation from <HI>Dan</HI> to <HI>Beer&s;heba!</HI> Let us buckle to our Work in &s;ober Sadne&s;s. I promi&s;e you <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> it's now no time for to be je&s;ting; our Glory is departed! The Fire of the Lord is burn|ing on every &s;ide. Come, bring your Buckets, fill them with Tears: O that mine Eyes were Waters, and my Head a Fountain of Tears, that I might weep Day and Night over thee, O <HI>London.</HI> Hear, O ye that are afar off, li&s;&s;en to the Groans of <HI>Lon|don!</HI> Do you not hear her crying out as a Woman in Travail? Wherefore do I &s;ee Palene&s;s upon all Faces? Is there not a Cau&s;e? Come let us gird Sack|cloth upon our Loins, and ca&s;t A&s;hes upon our Heads for <HI>London</HI>'s Calamity; and if Men and Wo|men can't &s;peak, A&s;hes, double-burnt Bricks, and that di&s;mal <HI>Cha&s;ma</HI> where <HI>London</HI> &s;tood, opens its Mouth, and cries, <HI>Have Pity upon me, O ye my Friends,
<PB REF="25">have Pity upon me, for the Hand of the Lord hath touch|ed me!</HI> Is it nothing to you, O ye that dwell in the Countries? Come up to <HI>London</HI> and &s;ee, and let your Eyes affect your Hearts. Behold, how many di&s;con|&s;olate Creatures walk up and down upon the Rub|bi&s;h of <HI>London.</HI> Come and &s;ee what De&s;olation the Lord hath made: How dreadful hath his Di&s;plea|&s;ure &s;hewed it &s;elf, upon &s;ome that are better than your &s;elves! Con&s;ider how many thou&s;ands of &s;uf|fering Families there be which were &s;ometimes able, and &s;ome of them willing to relieve others in &s;uch a State. Behold the Merchants and Citizens of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> like Per&s;ons amazed, &s;truck thorow with Hor|ror, and filled with Perplexity; and if you have a|ny thing of a Chri&s;tian in you, let it now be &s;een: Let your Heart and your Pur&s;e too be opened wide; and go home and mourn over that calamitous Place, and weep for their Sins which had a Hand in bring|ing that Mi&s;ery upon them. Stir up others to pity them: Tell them what a &s;ad Sight your Eyes have &s;een, and labour to make them and your Heart more &s;en&s;ible of their Sufferings. I may &s;ay of theirs too: Can the Head be deadly &s;ick, and the re&s;t of the Bo|dy very well? I believe the Country will quickly feel the &s;ad Effects of <HI>London</HI>'s Poverty. Go home therefore and pour out your Souls before God, and let your Eyes run down with Tears: Let <HI>England</HI>'s Mourning be like the Mourning of <HI>Hadadrimmon</HI> in the Valley of <HI>Megiddo.</HI> Pity poor <HI>London,</HI> O ye Nobles and Gentry of <HI>England.</HI> This is not a time for an Engli&s;hman, for a Chri&s;tian, to be hoarding up Trea&s;ure in, except it be on the Backs and Bellies of Chri&s;tians: This is no time to be drinking Wine in Bowls, to be &s;laying of Oxen and killing of Sheep: This is no &s;ea&s;on to fare as <HI>Dives</HI> did, except you will be content with his Reckoning. If therefore you have any Bowels, any Compa&s;&s;ion, contract all your &s;uperfluous Expences for more noble U&s;es. Act
<PB REF="26">for the Lord's &s;ake as Men that are not void of Hu|manity, and as tho&s;e that might have been, and may be in a &s;uffering Condition before you die. Let not your Charity begin and end too at home. Let not your Charity be cold after &s;uch a Fire, le&s;t your Turn be next to know what Fire is. Con&s;ider for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and for your own &s;akes too, whether be more nece&s;&s;ary, the pampering of Hor&s;es, the feeding of Hounds, or the relieving of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians? Which do you think you &s;hall reflect upon with mo&s;t Comfort when you come to die? Which do you be|lieve will be the be&s;t Account at the Day of Judg|ment, when God &s;hall ask you how you &s;pent your E&s;tates? To &s;ay, I &s;pent &s;o many hundreds by the Year in &s;umptuous Hou&s;e-keeping, &s;o much upon idle unnece&s;&s;ary Attendants, &s;o much at Cards and Dice, &s;o much upon Plays and Whores, &s;o much given to make Men drunk, and &s;o much at the Ta|vern; Or &s;o many hundreds for the feeding and clo|thing of God's Poor; &s;o many hundreds for a Stock to &s;et up diligent young Men, that were undone by the Fire; &s;o much for the pre&s;ent Relief of tho&s;e that were brought into pre&s;&s;ing Exigencies by that cala|mitous Flame, and &s;uch like U&s;es? Which of the&s;e do you think will be the mo&s;t comfortable Account at the Day of Judgment? Remember that tho&s;e that will not &s;hew Mercy at &s;uch a time, &s;hall have Judg|ment without Mercy. Your Sin helped to lay <HI>London</HI> wa&s;t: O that I could be as confident that your Charity and Reformation would help to build it again! O that you may have as great a Hand in its Reparation, as you had in its Deva&s;tation! But I &s;ay again, if the Groans of <HI>London</HI> be not heard by you, if her Calamities do not affect you, know this, that the Day is coming when you &s;hall cry and not be heard, when you &s;hall groan and not be pitied.</P>
<P><PB REF="27">O let not me rejoyce till I &s;ee thy Glory, <HI>O Eng|land,</HI> returning. <HI>London</HI> &s;hall never be forgotten by the while my Breath la&s;teth. The Servants of God favour the very Du&s;t of our <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Once more Chri&s;tians let me with all Earne&s;tne&s;s be&s;peak your Help. Help all you that love <HI>London,</HI> that love God, that love your Souls, help with your Tears and Prayers, help with your Hands, Hearts, and Pur|&s;es: It may be the Lord will be gracious to us, and cau&s;e his Face to &s;hine upon us, and then we &s;hall be &s;aved. I &s;ay again, and let all that wi&s;h well to poor <HI>England</HI> &s;ay &s;o too, Let us gird us with Sack|cloth, and ca&s;t A&s;hes upon our Heads, and cry mightily unto the Lord for her that &s;its in the Du&s;t. Proclaim a Fa&s;t, call a Solemn A&s;&s;embly, gather the People together, &s;anctify the Congregation, ga|ther the Children, and tho&s;e that &s;uck the Brea&s;ts, let the Bridegroom go forth out of his Chamber, and the Bride out of her Clo&s;et; let the Mini&s;ters of the Lord weep bitterly between the Porch and the Al|tar, and let them &s;ay, <HI>Spare thy People, O Lord, and give not up thy Heritage to Reproach:</HI> Wherefore &s;hould our Enemies &s;ay, <HI>Where is their God?</HI> Then will the Lord be jealous for his Land, and pity his People; yea, the Lord will an&s;wer, and &s;ay unto <HI>London,</HI> I will rai&s;e thy wa&s;t Places again, and I will build thy Streets, and the Voice of Joy and Gladne&s;s &s;hall be again heard in thee; yea, the Voice of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving; I will &s;end you Corn, Wine and Oyl, and thou &s;halt he &s;atisfied therewith. I will re&s;tore the Riches to thee, which the Fire hath taken from thee. I will &s;end Peace into your Walls, and Pro&s;perity into your Borders; I will re&s;tore your Teachers which are removed into Corners; I will &s;end the Go&s;pel of Peace in its Power and Purity a|mong you; I will write Holine&s;s to the Lord upon the Foundations of your Hou&s;es, upon your Gates and Palaces; your Riches, Trade and Glory &s;hall
<PB REF="28">return unto you; and you &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed and your Po&s;terity after you: But if you will &s;till do wicked|ly, and will not repent, I do here declare, that all the&s;e are but the Beginnings of Sorrows; for all this the Anger of the Lord &s;hall not be turned away, but his Hand &s;hall be &s;tretched out &s;till; and he will yet plague you &s;even times more for your Sins: And your God will be a con&s;uming Fire, which will again break out and devour what you have &s;a|ved out of the&s;e Flames; and through the Wrath of the Lord of Ho&s;ts the whole Land &s;hall be Darkne&s;s, and the People &s;hall be as the Fewel of Fire, and no Man &s;hall &s;pare his Brother, and he &s;hall &s;natch on the right Hand and be hungry; and he &s;hall eat on the left, and not be &s;atisfied; they &s;hall eat every one the Fle&s;h of his own Arm. <HI>Mana&s;&s;eth</HI> &s;hall be again&s;t <HI>Ephraim,</HI> and <HI>Ephraim</HI> again&s;t <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> and both of them again&s;t <HI>Judah.</HI> For all this his Anger will not be turned away, but his Hand is &s;tretched out &s;till. Wherefore, repent, O <HI>London,</HI> of thy abominable Uncleanne&s;s and Pride; repent of thy Back&s;liding and Idolatry; repent of thy Per|jury, lying and cheating, repent of thy Luke-warm|ne&s;s and Hypocri&s;y; repent of thy Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Worldly-mindedne&s;s and Cruelty; repent of thy Gluttony and Drunkenne&s;s. Ye Daughters of <HI>London</HI> which were haughty, and walked with &s;tretched-forth Necks, and wanton Eyes, walking and min|cing as ye went, the Lord hath taken away much of the Bravery of your tinkling Ornaments, of your changeable Suits of Apparel, your Mantles and Gla&s;&s;es, Fine Linnen, Hoods, and Vails, he hath &s;tained the Glory of your Pride; and will you again be as fooli&s;h as ever? Will you never under&s;tand your Sin till God hath burnt the re&s;t of your fine Things and you too? O ye Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> hath not God written Vanity upon your greate&s;t Enjoy|ments? Have not your Riches taken them&s;elves
<PB REF="29">Wings and flew away? And will you again after all this &s;et your Hearts upon &s;uch &s;hort-lived uncer|tain Riches, and undervalue tho&s;e true and everla|&s;ting Riches. O look upon the World as it is, as an empty, di&s;&s;atisfying, tran&s;itory thing, and too mean a Match for a Soul. Is it not now high time to look after a Hou&s;e that can't be burnt, <HI>A Hou&s;e not made with Hands, which is eternal with God in the Heavens?</HI> Is it not now high time to get into that City which hath Foundations, who&s;e Builder and Maker is God? Will it not now be for our Intere&s;t to look after our Freedom in that <HI>New Jeru&s;alem?</HI> There we may have a Dwelling more &s;afe than a Hou&s;e of Brick or hewen Stone, which a greater Fire than this was can't demoli&s;h or impair.</P>
<P>But if any be &s;o hardned and incorrigible, as to make a Pi&s;h of all this, I come to &s;uch with dread|ful Tidings e're long; O &s;tupid Sinner, thou &s;halt behold a far more di&s;mal Fire, and hear far more lamentable Outcries, and &s;ee thou&s;ands of thou&s;ands at their Wits Ends, filled with un&s;peakable Horror and Perplexity, not being able to &s;ave the lea&s;t Rag to cover their Nakedne&s;s, nor to &s;ave them&s;elves from tho&s;e dreadful Flames; and if thou repent not &s;peedily, thou &s;halt be one of them; and thou al&s;o &s;halt wi&s;h thou mighte&s;t be &s;o happy as to be covered with the Ruins, or con&s;umed to nothing with the Flames; thou &s;halt call and cry to the Rocks to cover thee, and to the Mountains to hide thee from that terrible Sight, the Lord Chri&s;t the Judge, who&s;e Eyes are like flaming Fire. Belo|ved, the Day of the Lord is coming which &s;hall burn like Fire, in which not Hou&s;es and Cities on|ly, but Lands al&s;o, yea, the whole World &s;hall be all in a Flame, Heaven and Earth will be on Fire: That will be a Fire indeed! Let your Lo&s;&s;es be never &s;o great now, I am &s;ure if you do not repent, they will be infinitely greater then. Tho&s;e three Nights
<PB REF="30">were &s;ad Nights wherein you could not take a wink of Sleep for the Fire; but that will be a far &s;adder Night, which will never have a Day following it, in which you can't be able to take a Moment's Re&s;t for tho&s;e intollerable Flames. You will then think the burning of your Hou&s;es nothing to the burning of your Bodies; and the burning of your Bodies no|thing to the Torments of your Souls. I tell thee, O Sinner, if thou continue&s;t an Enemy to God, God hath not done with thee yet, the wor&s;t is &s;till to come. Upon the Wicked he will rain Fire and Brim&s;tone, and an horrible Tempe&s;t; and this &s;hall be the Por|tion of their Cup; and the Wicked &s;hall be turned into Hell, and ca&s;t into that Lake that burns for e|ver and ever: A Fire that &s;hall never, never, never be quenched. O that's a terrible Fire which &s;hall not burn four Days, nor four Years, nor four thou|&s;and, nor four Millions, nor four Millions of Millions (O happy were it for Sinners if it might at la&s;t be quenched, though it la&s;ted never &s;o long) but it &s;hall burn for ever, for ever, for ever! O that will be a di&s;mal Day when that Fire begins to break out! When the Sinners in <HI>Zion</HI> &s;hall be a|fraid, and the Hypocrites &s;hall be &s;urprized! Who among us &s;hall dwell with devouring Fire? Who a|mong us &s;hall dwell with everla&s;ting Burnings? Tremble, O Sinners of <HI>England,</HI> tremble ye Sinners of <HI>London,</HI> left tho&s;e unquenchable Flames &s;eize upon you, which are infinitely more dreadful than tho&s;e which your Eyes have &s;een with abundance of Ter|ror. That's a Fire which &s;hall be felt more than &s;een; the Lord deliver poor <HI>London</HI> from that Fire, and then we &s;hall the more patiently bear this! O that &s;ome of them which have &s;aved mo&s;t of their Goods out of this Fire, may not lo&s;e them all, and their Souls too in that! O happy would it be if this Fire &s;hould put us all into &s;uch a Fright that we may be afraid of Fire ever after! I mean of the Fire of
<PB REF="31">Sin, of the Fire of God's Wrath, of the Fire of Hell. But let me add a Word or two more to them which have been great Loo&s;ers by this dreadful Fire. Re|member that you have that within you which kind|led this great Flame; be as careful to quench that Fire within you, as you were to quench that with|out you, and more too: Fear Sin more than Fire, more than Hell, and then neither of them &s;hall do you any hurt. And again, I &s;ay, &s;peedily make &s;ure of &s;uch a Hou&s;e, &s;uch Goods, &s;uch an E&s;tate which is not &s;ubject to &s;uch Hazards. And now ma|ny of you are turned out of your Habitations, and have lo&s;t a great part of that little which you had, and are out of a great deal of your Employments, whereby you might again &s;tand upon your Legs; I mu&s;t tell you among other Lo&s;&s;es, I believe &s;ome of you have lo&s;t your Friends too. Mo&s;t of them which in your Pro&s;perity &s;eemed much to re&s;pect you, will in your Adver&s;ity forget your Acquaintance. Per|haps by this time &s;ome of you have experienced that a true Friend is a greater Rarity than you thought it was; and that among all your Acquaintance (if you be very poor) you can &s;carce go to one that will receive you and yours, and make him&s;elf a Sharer in your Sufferings, and you a Sharer with him in his Comforts. You might be welcome while you had a free Trade, and good Comings in, but now their Hou&s;es are too &s;traight, and they are &s;orry that they cannot accommodate you, and with &s;ome &s;uch poor Excu&s;es you are &s;haken off; or if they do receive you for a while, they are quickly &s;ick of your Com|pany, and you &s;hall &s;oon perceive that their Coun|tenance is not towards you as formerly. But &s;up|po&s;e, which I believe too few will find, that &s;ome Friend will do all that I &s;peak of; yet where is there &s;uch a Friend that will not only &s;upply your pre|&s;ent Exigencies, but al&s;o make up your pa&s;t Lo&s;&s;es, and make abundant Provi&s;ion for you, for the future,
<PB REF="32">again&s;t all manner of Wants? Such a Friend as this I may confidently &s;ay you &s;hall rarely find. But now my Errand to you is to bring you Tidings of &s;uch a Friend; one that (if you will be quiet, and let him alone to do with you as he plea&s;eth) will make you a far greater Gainer than a Loo&s;er by this Fire. <HI>Acquaint now thy &s;elf with him, and be at Peace, and hereby Good &s;hall come unto thee.</HI> Get but Ac|quaintance with God, and he will provide you a convenient Hou&s;e, he will lay you in the be&s;t Wares, and that without Money and without Price, he will make you to forget your Lo&s;&s;es, and you &s;hall drive a better Trade than ever you did in your Lives; and you &s;hall &s;ay, that as for your part, it is well that you were thus undone. Your Incomes &s;hall be far greater, your Returns quick and &s;urer, your State &s;hall be as much altered for the better, as <HI>Job</HI>'s was at his latter End. Now, if ever, it is &s;ea&s;ona|ble looking out for &s;uch a Friend. He alone is <HI>the be&s;t Friend in the wor&s;t Times.</HI> He knows <HI>Job</HI> upon the Dunghil, as well as <HI>David</HI> upon the Throne. He will be mo&s;t kind when others are like to be mo&s;t unkind. He will vi&s;it you when others will &s;carce look upon you. In his Hou&s;e you &s;hall be as welcome as ever; in his Hou&s;e are many Man&s;ions; if it were not &s;o, he would have told you. In his City there is room enough, and you &s;hall have Entertain|ment there, and be more welcome than if you &s;taid away; his Doors will be open to them which have no Hou&s;es to hide their Heads in. Come to him, ye harbourle&s;s ones, he invites you earne&s;tly and heartily, and he will give you Shelter. You that have no Friends, or but &s;orry ones, come to him now in your Straights, and he will never ca&s;t your Pover|ty or his Kindne&s;s in your Teeth, except your Car|riage be proud and unbecoming your State: But let me tell you this for your Comfort, that if you do once come to him, he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t you out again;
<PB REF="33">once your Friend, and &s;o for ever. Now, now is the time that &s;uch a Friend would be worth the ha|ving: This is a Friend indeed. Now is the time, if ever, to look after &s;omething, that greater Flames than tho&s;e which turned this City to A&s;hes can't con&s;ume. God hath lately read to us a Lecture of the Vanity of all Creature-Enjoyments. The la&s;t Year he took a|way many of our deare&s;t Friends (we now &s;ee from what:) This Year he hath taken away many of your E&s;tates, and I fear the mo&s;t of the Friends that you have left will go with them; you mu&s;t not expect them to be &s;o &s;weet, loving, and kind, as &s;ometimes they were: (the more will be their Shame.) And will you after this refu&s;e Acquaintance with him, who will be better to you than a thou&s;and of the be&s;t Friends that ever Man had upon Earth. If you have lo&s;t your Hou&s;e, he will find you a better, one that is admirably furni&s;hed, gallantly &s;eated, where you &s;hall &s;it Rent-free, or pay but a Pepper-corn; he will al&s;o bear all your Charges for you, keep your Hou&s;e, and you &s;hall want for nothing as long as an infinite Store will hold out: You &s;hall live higher, &s;are better, be clothed better, have a better Trade, keep better Company, and have every thing better than before. O that you would but try what this Friend will do for you! And if after you have made a thorow Trial of him, you do not find him far better than I can expre&s;s, then al&s;o let me go for one of the mo&s;t unfaithful Friends in the World.</P>
<P>My Love to poor <HI>London,</HI> the Place of my Nativi|ty, is great, and upon many Accounts you may claim a greater Intere&s;t in my Affections, than any place in the World be&s;ides: And I could not tell how more lively to expre&s;s my dear Love to you, than by com|mending you to the Care of this great Friend, and by indeavouring all that I could po&s;&s;ible to get you acquainted with him, who&s;e Favour is better than Life, and who&s;e Friend&s;hip will infinitely &s;upply all
<PB REF="34">your Wants. I have in this following Di&s;cour&s;e gi|ven you a rude Character of this Friend, and I have laboured to &s;hew you what un&s;peakable Advantage will accrue to you by your Acquaintance with him in &s;uch a time as this is: I have given you &s;ome Di|rections how you may come to be acquainted with him. Pray for a Ble&s;&s;ing upon this Book, which hath co&s;t the Author &s;ome Pains, Prayers, Tears, and Groans, that what was here written, might be the Tran&s;cript of his own Experience, and might be &s;ome way &s;ub&s;ervient to the Glory of God in the Conver&s;ion and Comfort of Souls. Peru&s;e it with Seriou&s;ne&s;s, and it may be you may find that in it, that may make you more glad, than when your Corn and Wine and Oyl increa&s;ed. You can now &s;carce &s;ay that you want time for &s;uch a Work as this is; if you do, I &s;hall &s;ay you &s;hall not want time to repent. I thought if any Providen|ces were wak'ning, &s;uch as the&s;e were, wherefore I de&s;ired to &s;trike while the Iron was hot. O that the Lord would &s;trike in too! O that the Effect of my poor Labours, may be the bringing in of &s;ome of them that were formerly without Chri&s;t, and Aliens from the Common-wealth of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and Strangers from the Covenant of Promi&s;e, having no Hope, and without God in the World, to be acquainted with God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; that they who were &s;ome|times afar off might be made nigh by the Blood of Chri&s;t: That you may be no more Strangers and Foreigners, but Fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the Hou&s;hold of God. O if I may be but an In&s;trument of the Good of one Soul, I &s;hall think my Labour well &s;pent, and my Lo&s;&s;es turned into Gain. If you find any Good in the U&s;e of this Book, give God the Prai&s;e, and labour to keep a con&s;tant warm Sen&s;e of the Excellency of &s;uch a Friend upon your Spirit; and commend this Friend to all your Relation
<PB REF="35">and &s;uffering Acquaintance, that none of them may after their great Lo&s;&s;es, lo&s;e God, Heaven, and their Souls too. O that will be a dreadful Lo&s;s indeed! I again be&s;eech you, forget not to pray for one of the mo&s;t unworthy In&s;truments that ever Infinite Goodne&s;s made u&s;e of in &s;o glorious a Work.</P>

<P>UPon the &s;erious Peru&s;al of this Soul-pro|fiting Piece, I have found &s;o much of the Divine Spirit breathing in it, that I cannot but commend it to thy &s;erious Con&s;ideration. The Doctrinal Part is a <HI>Po&s;thume</HI> of one that lived at a high rate in Acquaintance with God: And no wonder he writes &s;o excellently about it; like <HI>Elihu,</HI> Job <HI>32.18, 19. I am full of Matter, the Spirit within me con&s;traineth me. Behold, my Belly is as Wine which hath no Vent, it is ready to bur&s;t like new Bottles.</HI> Or as that Prophet, Micah <HI>3.8. But truly I am full of Power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of Judg|ment, and of Might.</HI> This <HI>Po&s;thume</HI> had likely peri&s;hed, had not a dear Brother, both
<PB REF="37">in Natural and Spiritual Bonds, performed the Office of a Brother in rai&s;ing up of Seed: So as thou ha&s;t, as it were. Twins in this Piece; but not like <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>E&s;au,</HI> &s;trug|ling; but rather as tho&s;e Twins conjoined in Body, &s;weetly &s;ympathizing, rejoycing and con|doling with each other: I am &s;ure both mutu|ally con&s;pire for thy Soul's eternal Welfare. In the Doctrinal Part thou wilt meet with So|lidity of Judgment: In the Applicatory, no want of Judgment, but abounding Affection, and Strength of Argument to per&s;wade and prevail with thee. I confe&s;s if thou bee&s;t a cu|rious Reader, thou wilt not find Quotations of Fathers to plea&s;e thy Fancy; but if con&s;ci|entious, thou wilt find &s;erious Truths to pro|fit thy Soul. I reverence the Fathers, I high|ly e&s;teem Learning; but Pieces &s;tuft with Greek and Latin Quotations, larded with Rhetorical Flouri&s;hes, prove oftentimes but as painted Gla&s;s that darken Churches. Here are &s;ome few Sparks of Nature's dim Light from &s;ome Heathen Philo&s;ophers, that may &s;hame thee a Chri&s;tian, if thou knowe&s;t not more, and live&s;t not at a higher rate. Who|ever thou art, I be&s;eech thee, who am one that unfeignedly loves thy Soul, read this Piece but once over with a compo&s;ed calm Frame of Spi|rit for my &s;ake, and I am confident thou will
<PB REF="38">read it over again the &s;econd time for thine own Soul's &s;ake. Read much, but read not many things; live lowly, but let thy Heart be lifted up in the Ways of God; be re&s;olved for Heaven, and I a&s;&s;ure thee here are excel|lent Helps to &s;et thee forward in thy Journey. I am but thy Porter to open the Door, and let thee into this well-founded Fabrick; thou wilt find enough within to welcome thee, and &s;uch a Friend, that it will prove thy be&s;t Day thou came&s;t acquainted with him. I will not detain thee at the Door; but before thy En|trance (which I would have thee to retain in mind after thy Return) I give thee this &s;o|lemn Charge in the Name of my Great Ma|&s;ter, my dear and precious Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and in the Pre&s;ence of his holy Angels, that after thou ha&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly weighed the Doctrine, con&s;idered the Rea&s;ons, and &s;olemnly peru&s;ed the &V;&s;es, that thou appear before Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the&s;e my Elect Brethren, and me, at the Judgment approaching, unacquainted with God, if thou dare. My Heart's De&s;ire to God is, that thou maye&s;t be &s;aved; and &s;o I &s;hall commend thee to God, and the Word of his Grace, that thou maye&s;t receive Re|mi&s;&s;ion of Sins, and an Inheritance among tho&s;e that are &s;anctified by Faith that is in
<PB REF="39">Chri&s;t. From a Lover of Souls, willing to have no Name, &s;o the Name of Je|&s;us may be glorified in thine everla&s;ting Glory.</P>

<BIBL><HI>JOB xxii. 21.</HI></BIBL>
<Q>Acquaint now thy &s;elf with him, and be at Peace: thereby Good &s;hall come unto thee.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THo&s;e who have improved their Expe|rience of things by Wi&s;dom, and ga|thered up the Value of Man's Life by comparing his De&s;ire with his Enjoy|ments, his Troubles and Sorrows with his Con|tent and Joy, have concluded the worth of the Life of Man to be below nothing; they have drawn a black Line upon the whole, and &s;hut up all in Darkne&s;s. Thus <HI>Jacob</HI> of old, in the account which he gives of his Life to <HI>Pharaoh, Gen.</HI> 47.9. &amp; <HI>Job</HI> 5.7. And al&s;o <HI>Solomon,</HI> who had an extraordinary mea&s;ure of Wi&s;dom by Divine Di&s;pen&s;ation, who had a large Spirit, like the Sand of the Sea-&s;hore, he gave him&s;elf great Liberty in trying what that <HI>Good under the
<PB N="2" REF="41">Sun</HI> for the Sons of Men was, <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 2.1. When he had taken a Ta&s;te of all the World's Contents, yet he finds a Bitterne&s;s mixed in all Delights, which abideth longer than the Plea&s;ure, <HI>ver.</HI> 11, &amp; 17. And who&s;oever &s;hall enter into him&s;elf, and feel the Workings of his own Mind, &s;hall be able to read over the Tran&s;cript of the &s;ame in his own Con&s;cience. Who is he among the Sons of Men, that in his natural Life hath attained to a &s;tate wherein he was able to &s;ay, <HI>Here I will &s;tay, it is now well with me, I de&s;ire no Addition to my pre&s;ent Condition?</HI> If there be any &s;uch, I dare undertake to prove him unacquainted with him|&s;elf. Where now &s;hall I fa&s;ten the Blame of this univer&s;al Evil? Shall we fall out with our Life, as a thing not worth the having? Shall we &s;hrink unto our former Nothing, and ca&s;t up our Being and Life into the Hands of God, as that out of which we gathered nothing but Bitterne&s;s and Di&s;quiet? Far be this from us, this were to ju&s;tify that evil and wicked Servant, who &s;aid of God, <HI>That he knew he was a hard Ma&s;ter, reaping where he had not &s;own, and gathering where he had not &s;trawed.</HI> This would be to accu&s;e God of having made us to an unavoidable Nece&s;&s;ity of Mi&s;ery. How then comes it to pa&s;s, that we are all held fa&s;t in this common Calamity? It is from thy &s;elf, O Man, it is from thy &s;elf; this Evil is becau&s;e of our falling from God. It is a righteous thing with God, that when Man departed from him, he &s;hould reap the Fruit of his own Doings; and indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible for a Creature of our Compo&s;ure and Con&s;titution, but to feel it &s;elf di&s;&s;atisfy'd with all worldly material Imploy|ments, and to find Trouble and Di&s;quiet in it
<PB N="3" REF="42">&s;elf, while it is deprived of its true Good. If we would have a true Account of our Di&s;quiet and Di&s;&s;atisfaction, this it is. God made Man of all the Works of his Hands, to be the neare&s;t to him&s;elf, and hath fitted his Principles for a higher Life, than that which hath the Things of this World for its Object; but Man hath made him&s;elf like the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. We have given our Souls into captivity to our Bo|dies; or rather, we are fallen from our Union with God, and are gathered up into our &s;elves, and become deprived of a Sufficiency in Separa|tion from God; then it mu&s;t needs be, that we being gone down into a lower State than that which we were made to, &s;hould find nothing but Di&s;&s;atisfaction and Emptine&s;s; here we are by Nature, and hitherto we have brought our &s;elves by for&s;aking God.</P>
<P>Now the great Enquiry will be, what Reme|dy there is for this our woeful Condition; is there any way whereby we may be delivered from this Mi&s;ery? If there be, what way is it? The&s;e Words, which I have cho&s;en to &s;peak to, do contain the An&s;wer to this Enquiry.</P>
<P><HI>Acquaint now thy &s;elf with him, and be at peace, thereby Good &s;hall come unto thee.</HI> This is the Coun&s;el of one of <HI>Job</HI>'s three Friends to him in the time of his great Affliction. You have heard of the Affli|ction of <HI>Job,</HI> and how his three Friends came to relieve him with their Coun&s;el; but the Devil, who had a Commi&s;&s;ion from God to try his ut|mo&s;t with <HI>Job,</HI> yet &s;paring his Life, made u&s;e of his Friends, who are to be a Comfort in the Hour of Adver&s;ity, to be a great means of his Di&s;quiet, &s;o that he cries out of them, <HI>Mi&s;erable Comforters
<PB N="4" REF="43">are ye all,</HI> Chap. 16.2. And the great way of their troubling him, was, by mi&s;applying, by making fal&s;e application of true Principles. In their Di&s;|cour&s;es there are many excellent Truths; yet by their hard con&s;truing, and ungrounded condem|ning of him, they by God are reproved, as not having &s;poken the thing that was right, <HI>Chap.</HI> 41. 7. yet in many things their Coun&s;el was &s;uitable and &s;ea&s;onable, of which &s;ort the Words in the Text may be accounted. In this Chapter <HI>Eli|phaz</HI> had been inquiring into the cau&s;e of <HI>Job</HI>'s great Affliction, and holding this for an undeni|able Principle, that the righteous God, being the great Di&s;po&s;er of Affliction, did bring this Evil upon him becau&s;e of his Sin; he mea&s;ured the greatne&s;s of his Sins by the greatne&s;s of his Affli|ctions; he made account, becau&s;e God's Hand was gone forth in an extraordinary manner a|gain&s;t <HI>Job,</HI> therefore there was &s;ome extraordi|nary Guilt upon him, <HI>Ver.</HI> 5, &amp; 13. <HI>And thou &s;aye&s;t, How doth God judge through the dark Clouds?</HI> Thus we have his Apprehen&s;ion of <HI>Job,</HI> as one under great Affliction, becau&s;e of his great Sins; and the Text is <HI>Eliphaz</HI> his Coun&s;el to <HI>Job</HI> under this Character; and &s;o is &s;uitable Advice to tho&s;e that are under Sickne&s;s, or great Afflictions, and that are under the Guilt of great Sins.</P>
<P><HI>Acquaint thy &s;elf with him, and be at peace, there|by Good &s;hall come unto thee.</HI> The Words are a Do|ctrine for the Soul under a Sen&s;e of its lo&s;t Con|dition, with a Promi&s;e very comfortable upon the embracing thereof.</P>
<P>The Doctrine is, <HI>Acquaint thy &s;elf with him, and be at Peace.</HI></P>
<P>The Promi&s;e: <HI>Thereby Good &s;hall come unto thee.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="44">The&s;e Words, <HI>Be at peace,</HI> may be referred ei|ther to the former, as an addition to the Do|ctrine; <HI>Be at peace,</HI> that is, keep your &s;elves in a quiet Submi&s;&s;ion to the Hand of God; or to the latter, and &s;o, <HI>Be at peace,</HI> is as much as, <HI>Peace &s;hall be to thee.</HI></P>
<P>In the Doctrine we are to con&s;ider the <HI>Act,</HI> and <HI>Object.</HI></P>
<P>The Act, <HI>Acquaint.</HI></P>
<P>The Object is <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL> So that the <HI>Doctrine</HI> is, <HI>To enter into acquaintance with God.</HI> This Propo&s;ition &s;tands forth to the view of every Eye, that it is the Duty of Man to be <HI>acquainted with God.</HI></P>
<P>Now the fir&s;t thing that is before us to enquire after, is, What this <HI>Acquaintance with God is.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, to evidence and clear it to be the Du|ty of Man to <HI>acquaint him&s;elf with God.</HI> Acquain|tance with God implies &s;everal things.</P>
<P N="1">1. It &s;ignifies a full and determinate Know|ledge of this Truth, that there is a <HI>God,</HI> and &s;o to know him, as to his Nature, di&s;tinct from all o|ther <HI>Beings.</HI></P>
<P>There is a three-fold Knowledge of God.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A <HI>Rational.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A <HI>Natural.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. A <HI>Supernatural.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Fir&s;t, there is a <HI>Rational Knowledge of God,</HI> which is a clear Di&s;covery of an Almighty, All-&s;uffici|ent Cau&s;e of all things, which is attained by a rea&s;onable di&s;cu&s;&s;ing Power of the Soul, which argueth from things that are vi&s;ible and &s;en&s;ible, to an invi&s;ible and &s;elf-principled Cau&s;e of all things. Man found him&s;elf brought into the
<PB N="6" REF="45">World furni&s;hed with an innumerable Variety of Creatures, and none of the&s;e having Power to make it &s;elf; we &s;ee likewi&s;e &s;uch an accurate Or|der in every particular Creature, and in all the Creatures one with another, that we cannot but &s;ee clearly that there is a Supream Almighty Cau&s;e of all things, who hath by his Power brought forth all things into Being; who is like|wi&s;e the mo&s;t wi&s;e Agent, who by his un&s;earch|able Wi&s;dom hath curiou&s;ly framed every Crea|ture, and by his wonderful Coun&s;el hath &s;et them in &s;uch an order, that they all &s;erve one another, till at length they all meet in Man, as in the common Center.</P>
<P>Secondly, there is a <HI>Natural Knowledge of God,</HI> which is the inward Touch, and mental Sen&s;a|tion of a Surpeam Righteous Judge, to who&s;e Trial we feel our &s;elves under an unavoidable Bond, in doing <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil.</HI> This is that which is commonly called <HI>Con&s;cience;</HI> this a Man finds in him&s;elf, if at any time he have committed any &s;ecret Sin what&s;oever, which none in the World knows but him&s;elf: He feels it to be a Pre&s;&s;ure upon his Spirit, as being under the examination of a Power &s;uperior to him&s;elf. Now this is no|thing el&s;e but a &s;ecret Impre&s;&s;ion that God hath made of him&s;elf upon the Minds of Men, by which Man is bound to &s;tand before the Tribu|nal of God. The&s;e two ways of knowing of God were very clear to Man in his perfect State; but &s;ince the Fall of Man they are much weaken'd and decay'd. But,</P>
<P>Thirdly, There is a <HI>Supernatural</HI> way where|by we come to know God, which hath repaired our Lo&s;s by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, and that is by God's ex|traordinary
<PB N="7" REF="46">Revelation of him&s;elf in his holy Scriptures; by the&s;e we may come to have a more clear di&s;tinct Knowledge of God, both that he is, and what he is. To the&s;e three ways of letting in the Knowledge of God into the Soul, three mental Acts of the Soul do an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, A rational Di&s;cour&s;e, by which we find out God by the Creatures.</P>
<P>Secondly, An inward Sen&s;ation, which feels God as ju&s;t in Good and Evil.</P>
<P>The third mental Act is Faith, which for its Foundation hath the Word of God.</P>
<P>There is a fourth way of knowing God, which is by Experiment; which is when God manife&s;ts him&s;elf to his peculiar ones, and lets out the Knowledge of him&s;elf to their Souls; as when the Sun breaks forth with a bright &s;hining in a cloudy Day. But this belongeth rather to ano|ther Head.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee the fir&s;t thing implied in this <HI>Acquaintance with God,</HI> which is the lowe&s;t.</P>
<P>Yet how many are there that have little <HI>Ac|quaintance with God</HI> in the&s;e Signs? May we not come to many who profe&s;s they know God, and yet among all their Thoughts, they have had few or none to &s;atisfy them&s;elves concerning him? How gro&s;s are the Apprehen&s;ions of &s;ome con|cerning God? Some Men re&s;i&s;t and &s;tifle that <HI>natural Knowledge</HI> that they have of God, &s;uch as tho&s;e, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.20. they did not like to retain God in their Knowledge, and God gave them over to a reprobate Mind, or a Mind void of Judgment, as the Word &s;ignifies. Others have lived all their Days upon the Bounty and Goodne&s;s of God, and yet have not been led by the Streams to the
<PB N="8" REF="47">Fountain, from which all hath flow'd. Others can bu&s;y them&s;elves all their time in other things, and little inquire into the Word of God, by which they may be lead to the knowledge of him: <HI>But woe to tho&s;e on whom the Fury of the Lord &s;hall be poured out, becau&s;e they know not God,</HI> Jer. 10.23.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Acquaintance with God,</HI> implies fre|quent Acce&s;s unto God. We do not u&s;ually reckon our &s;elves acquainted with any Per&s;on by a bare Knowledge that &s;uch a Per&s;on there is, and that we are able to give &s;ome general De|&s;cription of him; but when we &s;ay we are ac|quainted with any, it is under&s;tood that we have been in &s;uch an ones company, we have come to him, and been with him: &s;uch is our Acquain|tance to be with God.</P>
<P>Under this Head I &s;hall &s;peak,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Of that Separation that is of the Soul from God.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Of the Return of the Soul to God.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Of the Abiding of the Soul with God.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Of the Separation and Di&s;tance of the Soul from God.</HI> That corrupted E&s;tate in which every Man comes into the World, is a State of Separa|tion from God. This Di&s;tance is not to be under|&s;tood as a Phy&s;ical Natural Di&s;tance, for &s;o God is near to every one of us by his Omnipre&s;ence, and by his Infinite Power, &s;u&s;taining us in our Being and Actions, <HI>Acts</HI> 17.27, 28. <HI>Though he be not far from every one of us; for in him we live, move, and have our Being.</HI> But this is to be under&s;tood,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Of a moral Separation from God.</HI> There is a great Strangene&s;s between our Souls and God: We reckon our &s;elves to have little to do with him, and to be very remotely concerned in him; we reckon that God takes very little regard of
<PB N="9" REF="48">us, we look upon God as far from us, and we think God looks upon us as at a great di&s;tance; we love not God, and think that God loves not us.</P>
<P>Secondly, This <HI>Separation</HI> may be under&s;tood of a <HI>Judicial Di&s;tance,</HI> at which God hath &s;et &s;in|ful Man from him&s;elf. Man is kept out from God, as being unfit to approach to him in his Sin|fulne&s;s and Impurities; and that is either in this Life, in which condition every one is, <HI>till he be made nigh by Chri&s;t, and &s;et before the Father without Sin in him; till they are born again of the Spirit, and ju&s;tified, and &s;anctified by Chri&s;t,</HI> Ephe&s;. 2.13. <HI>Ye that &s;ometimes were afar off, were made near by the Blood of Chri&s;t.</HI> Here this judicial Separation is the Execution of that terrible Sentence, <HI>Depart from me ye Cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</HI> Mat. 25.41. Thus ye &s;ee the Di|&s;tance at which Man is from God, which is not Phy&s;ical, but either Moral or Judicial.</P>
<P>Secondly, When we are thus &s;eparated from God, if we will be <HI>acquainted</HI> with him, there is required a returning to God. <HI>Acquaintance</HI> doth nece&s;&s;arily imply an Union: Now where there was a former <HI>Separation</HI> and <HI>Di&s;tance,</HI> there is re|quired a Motion to Compliance, and a Return, either in both Parties, or in one at lea&s;t; &s;o that before ever we can be <HI>acquainted with God,</HI> there mu&s;t be a for&s;aking our former Di&s;tance, the Se|paration mu&s;t be removed. Now God hath done what could be conceived, and beyond what could be expected towards the reducing of us to an Uni|on with him&s;elf; whereas he might ju&s;tly have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hru&s;t us away from him for ever, and never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave given us liberty to come near him more, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eing &s;o filthy by Sin, that his Holine&s;s cannot

And &s;o i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would have been for us, had not God made i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> po&s;&s;ible by an Act of free Love; and he hath likewi&s;e revealed his Willingne&s;s to receive us, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we return, yea, his earne&s;t De&s;ire, <HI>Turn ye, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> will ye die?</HI> Yea, his rejoicing in our Return, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a Father rejoiceth to receive a prodigal Son tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hath departed from him.

<PB N="11" REF="50">Son mu&s;t return to his Father, &s;o Man mu&s;t return to God. Now it is Sin that &s;eparates be|tween us and God, and keeps good things from us, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 59.2. <HI>Your Iniquity hath &s;eparated between you and your God, and your Sins have hid his face from you.</HI> Therefore while we cleave to our Sins, we are &s;eparated from God: till we are &s;eparated from our Sins, we cannot be united to God. Thus ye &s;ee our Separation from God, and our nece&s;&s;ity of returning to God, before there can be any Ac|quaintance with him.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>To our Acquaintance with God,</HI> is re|quired an abiding with God. We reckon not our &s;elves acquainted with any Per&s;on upon the fir&s;t Meeting, or when there hath pa&s;&s;ed but a Word or two between us; but it is &s;uppo&s;ed to acquain|tance, that we have made a con&s;iderable &s;tay with him, and have had frequent acce&s;s to him. Thus it is between God and us; we mu&s;t not only come to him, but abide with him, or el&s;e we &s;hall never be acquainted with him, <HI>John</HI> 8.13. <HI>If ye continue in my Word, then are ye my Di&s;ciples.</HI> So I &s;ay, if you return to God, and continue with God, then &s;hall ye be acquainted with him in|deed. <HI>Acquaintance</HI> &s;ignifies not a bare Act, but a State or Habit. Now this is the difference be|tween an Act and a State; that an Act is pa&s;|&s;ing and gone; but a State &s;ignifies an abi|ding and continuance. There may be a draw|ing nigh to God without abiding and continu|ing with God, upon &s;ome deep Conviction, or &s;trange Providence, or eminent Danger; as it is &s;aid, <HI>In their Affliction they will &s;eek me early.</HI> Yet they may &s;oon forget and for&s;ake God. This is but a &s;eeming and practical approaching to
<PB N="12" REF="51">God, a drawing nigh in appearance, when the Heart is far from God: but that approaching to God which makes acquaintance with God, is abiding with him: Tho&s;e that are acquainted with a &s;piritual Life know the&s;e things what they are, and that they are the greate&s;t Realities in the World; they know that &s;ometimes there is a greater nearne&s;s of their Souls to God, they are &s;en&s;ible of the Approaches of their Heart to God, and of the withdrawing of their Souls from God; they know what it is for the Soul to feel the Ap|proaches of God, and his Smiles fill their Souls with un&s;peakable Comfort: and to feel God withdrawing from the Soul, this clouds their Joy, and makes them go mourning: they can tell you at &s;uch a time they were brought unto his Banquetting-hou&s;e, and his Banner over them was Love: They can tell you at &s;uch a time Chri&s;t came into his Garden to eat his plea&s;ant Fruits; at &s;uch a time they heard the Voice of their Beloved, &s;aying, <HI>Open to me, my Si&s;ter, my Spou&s;e, my Love, my Dove, my undefiled.</HI> And when the Soul hath neglected this Knock of Chri&s;t to open to him, that then he hath with|drawn: <HI>I opened to my Beloved, but my Beloved had withdrawn him&s;elf, and was gone.</HI> The&s;e things are the Experiences of a precious Child of God, which I fear are little felt, and little known a|mong&s;t us: but where the&s;e things are not, there is no <HI>Acquaintance with God.</HI> For,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>They do know him.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>They draw nigh to him, they have near acce&s;s to him.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>They have intimate Conver&s;e with him.</HI> This is another thing required to Acquaintance.
<PB N="13" REF="52">We are not &s;aid to be acquainted with any Per|&s;on, unle&s;s we have had intimate Conver&s;e with him. We may be next Neighbours, and yet have no acquaintance, unle&s;s our Conver&s;ation hath been mutual. So it is between God and us; there may be a nighne&s;s between the Soul and God, and yet no acquaintance between the Soul and God. We are nigh to God in our De|pendance upon him, we are near to God by his immediate Providence and Su&s;tentation of us, and by his Omnipotence. There is a Nearne&s;s to God by way of Dedication. As God &s;et apart the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to be a People near unto him&s;elf; &s;o the vi&s;ible Church of God is nearer to him than tho&s;e that are not of the Church. There is a Nearne&s;s of Dedication among us by Bapti&s;m. But all this may be without acquain|tance. There is therefore required to our ac|quaintance with God, an intimate Conver&s;e with God. We have great Conver&s;e with tho&s;e who are of the Family or Society with us. Now &s;uch is our acquaintance with God, as tho&s;e who are of his Family. God is called the Father of the Families of all the Earth: and the vi&s;ible Church is reckoned as God's Family; but in a great Fa|mily there may be little acquaintance with tho&s;e Per&s;ons which be of remote Employments: but to acquaintance with God there mu&s;t be &s;uch a relation as implies familiar Conver&s;e. This In|timacy that the People of God have to him, is expre&s;&s;ed by the neare&s;t Relations in Scripture. As <HI>Abraham</HI> is called <HI>the Friend of God,</HI> 2 Chron. 20.7. <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> prays unto God, and &s;aith, <HI>Art not thou our God, who did&s;t drive out the Inhabitants of this Land before thy People</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and gave it to

John 15.15. <HI>Hence|forth I call you not Servants, but Friends, for the Ser|vant knows not what his Lord doth; but I have cal|led you Friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.</HI> Now by <HI>Friend</HI> is commonly under&s;tood a State of Con|ver&s;e and Society one with another. And this Intimacy is expre&s;&s;ed likewi&s;e by the Relation of Husband and Wife, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 54.5. <HI>For thy Maker is thy Husband.</HI> Ho&s;. 2.7. <HI>Then &s;hall &s;he &s;ay, I will go and return to my Husband, for then was it better with me than now.</HI> By <HI>Husband</HI> there is meant <HI>God.</HI> And the whole Book of the <HI>Canticles</HI> is a Relation of the mutual Conver&s;e betwixt God and his People, betwixt Chri&s;t and his Church, under the Relation of a <HI>Bridegroom</HI> and his <HI>Spou&s;e.</HI> Now what Conver&s;e more intimate than be|tween Husband and Wife? Such is that between a Soul acquainted with God, and God. Again, this is &s;hadowed out to us under the Relation of a Father and his Children, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.1. <HI>Behold, what manner of Love the Father hath be&s;towed upon us, that we &s;hould be called his Sons!</HI> And the holy Spirit is given to be the Spirit of Adoption in the Hearts of God's People, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.15, 16. <HI>Ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby ye cry Abba, Father. The Spirit it &s;elf beareth witne&s;s with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God.</HI> What is &s;ignified by this <HI>Relation,</HI> but a nigh Union and intimate Conver&s;e between the Soul and God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> And this is nece&s;&s;ary to our acquaintance with God, even intimate Conver&s;e with God.

<PB N="15" REF="54">Objects of our Imployments are the &s;ame, then are we &s;aid to conver&s;e with God, when we are imployed about tho&s;e things wherein God is mo&s;t. When there is, as it were, a mutual Com|merce and Trading between the Soul and God; Man giving him&s;elf up to God, and God giving him&s;elf out to Man; Man taking up the Intere&s;t of God, and God undertaking for the Intere&s;t of Man; the&s;e and &s;uch like actings are the conver&s;e which the Soul hath with God. I &s;peak of things which the Men of the World are not acquainted with; but tho&s;e that are acquainted with God, know the&s;e things; and upon the mention of them, their Hearts leap within them. As Face an&s;wereth to Face in a Gla&s;s, &s;o Experience an|&s;wereth the&s;e things.

But I proceed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew what is meant by this Acquaintance with God.</P>
<P>Fourthly, To this Acquaintance with God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here is required a mutual Communication. Where there is Acquaintance between Man and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an, there hath been a mutual Interchange of conference and Di&s;cour&s;e. Thus when the Soul acquainted with God, there is an Interchange Conference between God and the Soul. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul openeth its Wants, breaths out its Com|plaints,
<PB N="16" REF="55">&s;preadeth its Nece&s;&s;ities before God; God openeth the Trea&s;ures of his Love in his Son, the rich Mines of his precious Promi&s;es, and the Se|crets of his Good-will to the Soul. Thus <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 25.15. <HI>The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him and he will &s;hew them his Covenant.</HI> Gen. 18.17. <HI>The Lord &s;aith, &s;hall I hide from</HI> Abraham <HI>the thing that I do?</HI> Tho&s;e that are Friends and Acquain|tance, they will let out their Thoughts and Pur|po&s;es one to another, and they give out them &s;elves mutually into Communion one with ano|ther. Thus Chri&s;t knocks at the Door of the Soul <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.20. <HI>Behold, I &s;tand at the Door and knock if any Man hear my Voice and open the Door, I will com in and &s;up with him, and he with me.</HI> Here is Chri&s;t offering him&s;elf to the Soul, and the Soul is to en|tertain him; at another time the Soul goes to God, and God entertains it: God hath promi&s;e that he will open, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.28. <HI>Knock, and it &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be opened unto you;</HI> and to him that knocks it &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be opened. There are frequent Actings among tho&s;e that are acquainted: And by the&s;e are em|pre&s;&s;ed to us the Acquaintance of the Soul with God.</P>
<P>Now the Communications that are between the Soul and God, are exceeding tran&s;cending a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> communications that are between Mens acquain|tance. Men may communicate their Thought<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their E&s;tates, their A&s;&s;i&s;tance to one another; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they cannot communicate their Life, not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Nature, nor their Likene&s;s; but &s;uch Communi|cations there are between God and the Soul th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is acquainted with him. All <HI>Being</HI> is a Commu|nication from God the fir&s;t <HI>Being;</HI> nay the &s;eve|ral Degrees of <HI>Being</HI> have &s;everal Communi|cations
<PB N="17" REF="56">from God, &s;ome greater and &s;ome le&s;&s;er; &s;piritual <HI>Beings</HI> have a higher Communication than natural; but God's highe&s;t Communicati|ons have been to Man in that my&s;tical Union of the Divine Nature to the Humane Nature in Chri&s;t; and next in the my&s;tical Union of the Sons of God to Chri&s;t, and in him to the Father. Thus Chri&s;t is &s;aid to live in us, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.20. <HI>I live,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Paul; yet not I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me.</HI> Thus Chri&s;t prays the Father for his Children, that they may be one, <HI>as thou Father art in me, and I in thee; that they be one in us,</HI> John 4.17, 21. &amp; John 1.15, 16. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall confe&s;s that Je&s;us is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. He that dwelleth in Love dwelleth in God;</HI> 2 Pet. 1.4. <HI>We are &s;aid to be Partakers of the Divine Nature.</HI> This Expre&s;&s;ion implies high Communication of God to Man. Again, there are high Acts of Communication from Man to God (for tho' God receives not from Man, yet Man is to act as giving out him&s;elf to God) &s;uch as to give up the Will to God's Will. As that of <HI>Eli, It is the Lord, let him do what &s;eemeth him good.</HI> And that of <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 15.16. <HI>If he thus &s;ay, I have no Delight in thee, behold, here am I, let him do with me as &s;eemeth good unto him.</HI></P>
<P>Another Act of high Communication of a Man's &s;elf to God, is parting with pre&s;ent Enjoy|ments for future Hopes, in confidence of God's Promi&s;e. Thus the Spirit of God works in the Children of God a Readine&s;s to for&s;ake Father or Mother, and Brethren, and Si&s;ter, and Life it &s;elf for the Cau&s;e of God. Thus <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> was wil|ling to become <HI>Nothing,</HI> that Chri&s;t might become <HI>All;</HI> to be ca&s;t <HI>down,</HI> that Chri&s;t might be lifted
<PB N="18" REF="57"><HI>up,</HI> John 3.13. <HI>He mu&s;t increa&s;e, but I mu&s;t de|crea&s;e.</HI> Thus <HI>Abraham</HI> gives his <HI>I&s;aac</HI> to die when God calls for him. Thus <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> e&s;teemed the Re|proach of Chri&s;t greater Riches than the Trea|&s;ures of <HI>Egypt,</HI> Heb. 11.26. <HI>Paul</HI> counted not his Life dear for Chri&s;t, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.24. The&s;e have been the actings of the Souls of tho&s;e that have been acquainted with God; and &s;uch Workings as the&s;e, are the feeling of a Child of God.</P>
<P>I have &s;hewed you four things which are re|qui&s;ite to Acquaintance with God.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Knowledge of God.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Acce&s;s to him.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Conver&s;e with him.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Communication to him and from him.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> There is likewi&s;e required to Acquain|tance a loving Compliance. Among&s;t Men Ac|quaintance implies Affection. And &s;o it is be|tween God and Man. Never any Soul was ac|quainted with God, that did not love God; and &s;uch a Soul is an Enemy to God; therefore very few are acquainted with God: but all that are not acquainted with God, are Enemies to him. If we &s;hould come to a Per&s;on that is not acquain|ted with God, and &s;ay, Thou art an Enemy to God; this would &s;eem a heavy Imputation: but I &s;peak it freely, thou, who&s;oever thou art, that art not acquainted with God, thou art an Enemy to God; for thou art &s;till as thou wer't born: but we are all Enemies to God according to our cor|rupt Nature, and abide Enemies till we come to be acquainted with God. Love to God, and Ac|quaintance with God go together, are heighten|ed by one another. Fir&s;t, God lets into the Soul by his Spirit a partial Di&s;covery of him&s;elf, and
<PB N="19" REF="58">by this, with the working of his Spirit, he inclines the Heart in Love to him. Then, on the fir&s;t working of the Soul toward God, he lets in a clear Light, whereby he draweth the Soul to a further degree of Love. A clear place for this, Eph. 3.17, 18. <HI>And that being rooted and grounded in Love, ye may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the Length, and Breadth, and Depth, and Height, and to know the Love of God which pa&s;&s;eth all Under&s;tanding: that ye might be filled with all the Fulne&s;s of God.</HI> The Love of God fits the Soul to comprehend the glorious Di&s;coveries of God; and the Di&s;coveries of God doth heighten our Love to God. Acquaintance with God makes us like unto God, as in <HI>John</HI> 3.2. <HI>We &s;hall &s;ee him as he is.</HI> And our Likene&s;s to God, as it makes us the Delight of God, &s;o it makes us delight in God; for the cau&s;e of Complacency and Love is a Like|ne&s;s between the Lover and Beloved. God doth not love us with a Love of Complacency, till we are like him; nor do we love God, till we are made like God. Now our beholding God, and being acquainted with him, is a great way to our being made like to God, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.18. <HI>We all with open Face, beholding as in a Gla&s;s, the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> Thus you &s;ee that Love is likewi&s;e required to our Acquain|tance with God; without it no Acquaintance.</P>
<P>I have in the fir&s;t part &s;poken of the Nature of Acquaintance with God in five Particulars. There mu&s;t be,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A Knowledge of God.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Nigh Acce&s;s to God.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Familiar Conver&s;e with God.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="59"><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Mutual Communication between us and God.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> An affectionate Love towards God.</P>
<P>The next thing &s;hould be to &s;hew that Man is to be acquainted with God; but we will fir&s;t take a review of the&s;e things. We have taken the&s;e things into our Under&s;tandings; now let us &s;et our Hearts to the&s;e things, for in the&s;e things is the Life of Religion. If there be acquain|tance with God, then gro&s;s Wickedne&s;s drops off, as Scales from an ulcerated Body, when the Con|&s;titution of the Body is mended. In acquaintance with God will be your only true Comfort in this Life; and the Perfection of it, is the very Happi|ne&s;s of Heaven. Let us then behold, till our Hearts earne&s;tly de&s;ire, till our Souls be drawn out after acquaintance with God. If God be to be known, to be approached unto, to be conver&s;ed with by me, will he communicate him&s;elf to me? and I my &s;elf to him. Oh that he would love me, that I might love him! Oh, ble&s;&s;ed are they that know him, as they are known of him! It is good for me to draw nigh to him. <HI>A day in his Court is better than a thou&s;and el&s;ewhere. My Soul longeth, yea, fainteth, for the Courts of the Lord My Heart and my Fle&s;h cryeth out for the living God</HI> O that I were received into Conver&s;e with God that I might hear his Voice, and &s;ee his Counte|nance, for his Voice is &s;weet, and his Counte|nance comely! Oh that I might communicate my &s;elf to God, and that he would give him&s;elf to me! Oh that I might love him! that I were &s;ick of Love! that I might die in Love! that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> might lo&s;e my &s;elf in his Love, as a &s;mall Dro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the unfathomle&s;s Depth of his Love! that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="21" REF="60">might dwell in the Eternal Love of him! This is <HI>Acquaintance with God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Acquaint now therefore thy &s;elf with God, and be at peace, &s;o &s;hall Good come unto thee.</HI> We now proceed to the next thing, which is to evidence it to be the Duty of Man, to acquaint him&s;elf with God. This then is that into which the whole Scripture runs, as into a Common Channel. The Scriptures are a Di&s;covery of God's Pro|ceedings with Man under a double Covenant, and this is the Great De&s;ign of God in both Covenants. The fir&s;t Covenant was, <HI>That while Man did remain in obedience to God, God would give Man free and intimate Acquaintance with him&s;elf.</HI> But if Man became Di&s;obedient, then he &s;hould be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an Intere&s;t in God, and of Communion with him; which was that Death threatned upon <HI>the eating the Forbidden Fruit.</HI> The Death of the Body is its being &s;eparated from the Soul; but the Death of the Soul, is in Separation from God. Now imme|diately upon <HI>Adam</HI>'s Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, Man be|comes unacquainted with God; &s;o that upon the hearing of the Voice of the Lord, <HI>they hid them&s;elves from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, among the Trees of the Garden.</HI> What a woful Ca&s;e is Man naturally in? He hath lo&s;t his Acquain|tance with God, and was in a way, never, never to recover it: Upon God's approach he flees. And &s;uch is the Nature of all Sin, it puts a Man into a Di&s;po&s;ition to greater Sins: every Departure from God inclines towards a greater. In the fir&s;t Covenant this is the Whole of it; it is both a Command to keep nigh to God, and a Promi&s;e of God's being
<PB N="22" REF="61">nigh to them, and a threatning of God's putting them away far from him, Man breaking the fir&s;t Covenant. The immediate Effect of it was the Sin of Fleeing from God, quite contrary to that Acquaintance. In&s;tead of their former Appre|hen&s;ions of God, they &s;eem to have forgotten his Omnipre&s;ence; in&s;tead of Peace with God, they have nothing but Dread and Torment in the Thoughts of God; in&s;tead of drawing nigh to God, they run away from him; in&s;tead of Con|ver&s;e with God, they choo&s;e never to have to do with him more; in&s;tead of giving them&s;elves up to God, they, if it had been po&s;&s;ible, would have hid them&s;elves from God. Acquaintance with God is the Sum of the fir&s;t Covenant; Un|acquaintance with God is the Mi&s;ery of the Breach of the Covenant. This is likewi&s;e the great De&s;ign and Purpo&s;e of God in the &s;econd Covenant. The &s;econd Covenant is this: When God beheld Man in a Mi&s;erable Condition, by rea&s;on of the Breach of the fir&s;t Covenant; in the un&s;earchable Riches of his Goodne&s;s, accor|ding to the Eternal Purpo&s;e of his Good-Will towards Man, he made an Agreement with his Son, to &s;end him among&s;t a Generation of Sin|ful Men, that if he would undertake to bring them back into Acquaintance with the Father, he was willing and ready to receive them again into Acquaintance with him; the Son being the expre&s;s Image of his Father's Will, and Per|&s;on, hath the &s;ame Good-Will to Man with the Father, and is ready to clo&s;e with his Father's Propo&s;als; and &s;o enters into a Covenant with the Father, to &s;atisfie Divine Ju&s;tice, and to take away Sin, and to take away the Middle-Wall of
<PB N="23" REF="62">Separation, to recover a Cho&s;en Generation, and to bring them back again to God. Thus he became the Head of another Covenant between God and Man. And as the fir&s;t Covenant was made with <HI>Adam</HI> for him and his Seed; &s;o the &s;e|cond Covenant is made with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for him and his Seed. Becau&s;e that the fir&s;t Covenant was broken in <HI>Adam,</HI> therefore the &s;econd Co|venant was put into &s;urer Hands, into the Hands of the Son, <HI>the &s;econd Adam,</HI> the Lord from Hea|ven. Now, I &s;ay, that the Great De&s;ign and Pur|po&s;e of this &s;econd Covenant is in reference to Man's Acquaintance with God, is clear. This is held forth to us in that Parable of the Lo&s;t Sheep, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.4, 5. <HI>When the Shepherd had lo&s;t one Sheep, he leaves the Flock, and &s;eeks for that which was lo&s;t.</HI> So when Man was lo&s;t by Sin, Je&s;us Chri&s;t leaves all, to recover and fetch home that which was lo&s;t. <HI>We all are gone a&s;tray like Lo&s;t Sheep,</HI> as <HI>David</HI> &s;aith of him&s;elf, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119. <HI>Chri&s;t is come to &s;eek, and to &s;ave, that which was lo&s;t,</HI> Luke 19.10. and Ephe&s;. 2.13, 14. <HI>But now in Chri&s;t Je&s;us they who &s;ometimes were afar off, are made nigh by the Blood of Chri&s;t; for he is our Peace who hath made both one.</HI> In Ver&s;e the Tenth, is a De&s;cription of our State without Chri&s;t, <HI>being Aliens from the Common|wealth of I&s;rael, being Strangers from the Covenant of Promi&s;e, and having no Hope, and without God in the World.</HI> This is a De&s;cription of our Unacquain|tance with God. But Chri&s;t makes up the Breach, and that by a double Act.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By Covenant with the Father, to make Man fit for Communion with him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> His giving Man A&s;&s;urance that the Father will receive him upon his Return.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="63">This then is the Great De&s;ign in all tho&s;e Glo|rious Accompli&s;hments of Chri&s;t, for this he left his Father's Bo&s;om, that he might bring us into Acquaintance with the Father; for this end did he who thought it no Robbery to be equal with the Father, make him&s;elf of no Reputation, and took upon him the <HI>form of a Servant,</HI> and was made in the <HI>Likene&s;s of Man;</HI> and being found in Fa&s;hion of a Man, he humbled him&s;elf, and became obe|dient unto Death, <HI>even the Death of the Cro&s;s,</HI> that he might bring Man into a Re-union with God; for this End did Chri&s;t live a Weari&s;ome Trou|ble&s;ome Life among a Company of Rebels and Enemies, as if a Man &s;hould live among Toads and Serpents: So that he cried out, as weary of any longer abiding with them, <HI>Oh Faithle&s;s Gene|ration! How long &s;hall I be with you? How long &s;hall I &s;uffer you?</HI> For this did he make him&s;elf an <HI>Of|fering for Sin;</HI> that by taking away Sin, he might bring Men to God. This is the Great Purpo&s;e of Chri&s;t in all his Offices. Ye have heard of the Three Offices of the Mediator, that he is a <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> a <HI>Prophet</HI> and a <HI>King.</HI> This is the end of the Prie&s;tly Office. The Purpo&s;e of Chri&s;t's offer|ing up him&s;elf a Sacrifice, was by Satisfying the Ju&s;tice of God, to make way for Sinners Return to God. This is the End of his Pro|phetical Office, to lead Men into Knowledge and Acquaintance with God. This is the End of his Kingly Office; That Governing them, and Ruling their Hearts by his Spirit, he might ef|fectually bring Men to God, to Acquaintance with him. Now then, &s;ince this is the Great De&s;ign of God in his Great Di&s;pen&s;ation to|wards Man, to keep Men in Acquaintance with
<PB N="25" REF="64">him&s;elf, and to reduce him when he had lo&s;t it! doth it not concern us to do our part for the bringing to pa&s;s this great Work? Shall God lo&s;e his End in making us, and in &s;etting Man in the World every way furni&s;hed for his Service? And &s;hall God lo&s;e his End in &s;ending his Son to re|ceive us, when we had for&s;aken him? Shall Chri&s;t leave his Father's Bo&s;om to bring us home to the Father, and &s;hall we refu&s;e to return? Shall he pour out his Soul, an Offering for Sin, that he might make way for our Acce&s;s to God, <HI>That we who were afar off, might be made nigh by the Blood of Chri&s;t?</HI> And &s;hall we fru&s;trate all by our refu&s;ing to go to him? Shall Chri&s;t come and offer us his Help and Direction to come to the Father, and &s;hall we abide &s;till Strangers? Shall the King's Son come into our Cottages to invite us to dwell with his Father at Court, and &s;hall we &s;hut the Door upon him, e&s;teeming our Cot|tages better than his Pallace?</P>
<P>Secondly, It is the Duty of Man to acquaint him&s;elf with god, becau&s;e therein is the Im|provement of his highe&s;t Excellency. Every one acknowledgeth an Excellency in Man, above all the re&s;t of this lower World: Now what is this Excellency of Man? Is it not that he is made in a Capacity of knowing God, and enjoying God, and having Communion with God? This is the Height of his Glory, Jer. 9.23, 24. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, let not the wi&s;e Man glory in his Wi&s;|dom, let not the mighty Man glory in his Might, nor the rich Man in his Riches; but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he under&s;tands and knoweth me, that I am the Lord that exerci&s;e loving Kindne&s;s, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the Earth, and Judgement, for in the&s;e
<PB N="26" REF="65">things I delight, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> Ye &s;ee here, where|in Man is to glory, for which he may value him|&s;elf as truly glorious. In his under&s;tanding, and knowing of God, Man &s;tandeth above the re&s;t of the Creatures, in that he is a rational intel|lectual Agent. This is part of the Image of God, even Knowledge, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.15. <HI>Which is renewed in Knowledge after the Image of him that created him.</HI> The nigher any thing re&s;embleth God, the grea|ter is the Excellency of that Thing: Now in this we re&s;emble God more than any other Crea|ture, in that we are knowing, under&s;tanding Agents; and the highe&s;t Improvement of this Excellency of Man, is in the Knowledge of God, and Acquaintance with God, <HI>Prov.</HI> 20.27. <HI>The Spirit of a Man is called the Candle of the Lord;</HI> that is, it is a Light &s;et up in the Soul, to direct the Soul to a Di&s;covery of God. This is the highe&s;t Improvement of our greate&s;t Excellency, and this is the Excellency of Man above other Crea|tures: This is that whereby one Man excels a|nother. Who are tho&s;e who&s;e Names are as precious Ointment poured forth? Who are tho&s;e which have obtained a good Report? Are not they tho&s;e who were mo&s;t acquainted with God? <HI>Enoch</HI> is &s;aid to walk with God; an Expre&s;&s;ion which &s;ignifies intimate Acquaintance with God; and therefore was <HI>tran&s;lated that he &s;hould not &s;ee Death.</HI> And <HI>Noah,</HI> who&s;e Family alone was pre|&s;erved when God de&s;troyed the whole World by Water, he was &s;aid to walk with God, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.9. Among all the Sons of Men he kept clo&s;e to God; and God took care of him alone. <HI>Abra|ham,</HI> who was the Father of the Faithful, he was called <HI>the Friend of God. Mo&s;es,</HI> who was the Me|diator
<PB N="27" REF="66">of the Old Covenant, he was &s;aid to <HI>&s;peak, with God Face to Face, as a Man &s;peaketh to his Friend.</HI> I might make mention of many more, who were the excellent ones of the Earth; be|cau&s;e they did delight in God, and God delight|ed in them, <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.16, 17. <HI>They that feared the Lord, &s;pake often one to another; and the Lord heark|ned and heard: and the Book of Remembrance was written for them that fear the Lord, and that thought upon his Name. And they &s;hall be mine, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, in the Day when I make up my Jew|els.</HI> Ye &s;ee how God accounts of tho&s;e that are of his Acquaintance, that met together and &s;pake of God, and that thought upon his Name; he reckons them among&s;t his Jewels, his peculiar Trea&s;ure: Such Honour have all tho&s;e that are acquainted with God. Ye &s;ee then the Excel|lency of Man above all the re&s;t of the other Creatures. Now if Man fail in this which is his highe&s;t Excellency, he will become the vi|le&s;t of Creatures. Every thing if it fail in its chiefe&s;t End and Purpo&s;e, and highe&s;t Excellen|cy, becomes ba&s;e and of no account: <HI>If Salt lo&s;e its Savour</HI> (&s;aith our Saviour) <HI>it is good for nothing.</HI> If Man have lo&s;t his Acquaintance with God, he is henceforth good for nothing. The Mind of Man is his Eye, by which he is to behold God; now if this Eye be blind, if the Light be Dark|ne&s;s, how great is that Darkne&s;s! The <HI>Jews,</HI> in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 15.1. are likened to a Vine, which, if it be barren, is good for no u&s;e: &s;hall Wood be ta|ken thereof for any Work? It is fit for nothing but to burn. So it is in Man, his great U&s;e and Excellency is his Acquaintance with God; now if he fails in this, he is good for nothing. Veri|ly,
<PB N="28" REF="67">Man is a ba&s;e, vile, worthle&s;s thing with|out Acquaintance with God. None are le&s;s e|&s;teemed among Men than they that want Wi&s;|dom to conver&s;e among Men. None are le&s;s e&s;teemed before God, than they that know him not, that have not Acquaintance with him, to conver&s;e with him. Ye &s;ee wherein the Excel|lency and Worth of Man con&s;i&s;teth, and that if there be a Deformity, where ought to be our chiefe&s;t Beauty, the whole is accounted as a de|formed Piece. It concerns us then to look that we keep our Glory un&s;potted, our Excellency in its due Value; that we do not degrade our &s;elves below what God hath placed us in. If we are not acquainted with God, our Souls &s;erve us to little purpo&s;e: It is a cau&s;ing the Prince, the Soul, to go on Foot, and to &s;erve the Body, which &s;hould be as a Servant; it is to let the Candle of the Lord burn out in wa&s;te.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Another Enforcement of this Duty of Acquaintance with God, is this. If we refu&s;e Acquaintance with God, it is a &s;lighting the greate&s;t of all the Mercies that God be&s;tows. Favours are to be valued, either by their proper Excellencies, or according to the good Will of him that be&s;tows them: both the&s;e Ways this is to be accounted the greate&s;t of Mercies. In God's giving us leave to be acquainted with him, he gives out him&s;elf to be known, to be loved, to be conver&s;ed with, to be enjoyed. What greater Gift can God give than him&s;elf? God is the Porti|on of his People, he is the greate&s;t Portion, the &s;u|re&s;t, the mo&s;t &s;uitable, and the only durable Portion. Thus they that know him e&s;teem of him, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 73.26. <HI>My Fle&s;h and my Heart faileth;
<PB N="29" REF="68">but God is the Strength of my Heart, and my Portion for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver.</HI> P&s;al. 16.5, 6. <HI>The Lord is the Portion of mine inheritance: The Lines are fallen to me in a plea&s;ant Place: yea I have a goodly Heritage. Ble&s;&s;ed are the People that are in &s;uch a Ca&s;e; yea, ble&s;&s;ed are the People who&s;e God is the Lord.</HI> No greater Mercy can be be&s;towed upon any People, Family, or Per&s;on, than this, for God to dwell among them. If we value this Mercy according to the Excel|lency and Worth of that which is be&s;towed, it is the greate&s;t; if we value it according to the good Will of him that gives it, it will appear likewi&s;e to be the greate&s;t Favour. The Great|ne&s;s of the good Will of God in giving him&s;elf to be our Acquaintance, is evident in the Na|ture of the Gift. A Man may give his E&s;tate to them to whom his Love is not very large; but he never gives him&s;elf but upon &s;trong Af|fection. God gives abundantly to all the Works of his Hands, he cau&s;eth the Sun to &s;hine upon the Evil, and upon the Good; and the Rain to de&s;cend upon the Ju&s;t and the Unju&s;t: But it can|not be conceived, that he &s;hould give him&s;elf to be a Portion, a Friend, Father, Husband, but in abundance of Love. Who&s;oever therefore &s;hall refu&s;e Acquaintance with God, &s;lighteth the greate&s;t Favour that ever God did be&s;tow upon Man. Now con&s;ider what a high Charge this is; to abu&s;e &s;uch a Kindne&s;s from God, is in Act of the greate&s;t Vilene&s;s. <HI>David</HI> was ne|ver &s;o provoked, as when the King of <HI>Ammon</HI> abu&s;ed his Kindne&s;s in his Amba&s;&s;adors, after his Father's Death. And God is highly provo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed when his greate&s;t Mercies, be&s;towed in the greate&s;t Love, are rejected, and ca&s;t away.
<PB N="30" REF="69">What could God give more and better than him|&s;elf? And how heavy will this Imputation be The&s;e are tho&s;e that look upon God, as not worth being acquainted with. Let us therefore con&s;ider how we &s;hall be able to &s;tand to the&s;e Accu&s;ations. Shall we not be &s;peechle&s;s, when the&s;e things &s;hall be charged upon us? Shall we not be confounded, when we &s;tand to the Tri|al of him to whom we had offered the&s;e great Indignities? How &s;hall we e&s;cape if we neg|lect &s;o great Salvation, &s;o great a Mercy?</P>
<P>Fourthly, it concerns us to acquaint our &s;elves with God, for without it we are in a Nece&s;&s;ity of Sin, and Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Soul unacquainted with God is in a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning, <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> 4.14. <HI>Having their Under&s;tanding darkened, alienated from the Life of God, through the Ignorance that is in them, becau&s;e of the Blindne&s;s of their Hearts.</HI> For want of Ac|quaintance with God, every Thought and Ima|gination of their Heart is evil continually, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.10, 11. <HI>There is none righteous, no not one: There is none that under&s;tands, there is none that &s;eeketh af|ter God.</HI> Not under&s;tanding, nor &s;eeking after God, is the nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e that there is <HI>none doth good.</HI> The Soul of Man is an Active <HI>Being,</HI> which is continually in motion; if it be not in motion to God, and in God, it will be in motion from God.

<P N="2">2. Without Acquaintance with God, we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in a Nece&s;&s;ity of Mi&s;ery. Indeed Sin is a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mi&s;ery; and to be in a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning, part of the Nece&s;&s;ity of Mi&s;ery. But be&s;ide that, there is a Nece&s;&s;ity of Mi&s;ery of another kind. What is the great Imployment of Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> unacquainted with God? Men labour in the ve|ry Fire, and weary them&s;elves for very Vanity <HI>Habak.</HI> 2.13. <HI>This was the Mi&s;ery of Men, beca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they knew not God.</HI> But in <HI>ver.</HI> 14. there is a Pro|mi&s;e of better Days, <HI>When the Earth &s;hall be fill

The Rea&s;on of it is, becau&s;e true Satisfaction and Peace cannot be, till our De&s;ires and Enjoyments are alike; and this cannot be till the Soul is acquainted with God: For nothing can fill up the De&s;ires of the Soul but God. The Soul of Man is mighty &s;pacious, &s;o that it cannot be filled with the World; and while it feels an Emptine&s;s, it &s;till cries out for more, and cannot be filled till it be filled with the Ful|ne&s;s of God, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.19. The prodigal Son had no|thing but Husks to feed upon, when he was gone from his Father's Hou&s;e; he would fain have filled his Belly with the Husks, but could not; they were not Food for the Soul. When we are departed from God, we have nothing to feed on but the World, and we would &s;ill our Souls with the World, but cannot; for it is not Food for the Soul. <HI>Acquain|tance</HI> with God is the Food of the Soul. <HI>Job</HI> 23.12. <HI>I have e&s;teemed the Words of his Mouth more than my nece&s;&s;ary Food.</HI> So that a Soul that is not acquainted with God, is fami&s;hed for want of Food, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 42.2. <HI>My Soul thir&s;teth for God, for the living God. When &s;hall I come and appear before God? David</HI> was acquainted with God, but for want of an actual Enjoyment, how doth he here breathe out the Trouble of his Spirit? <HI>As the Hart panteth after the Water-brooks, &s;o panteth my Soul after thee, O God.</HI> The Soul is &s;till panting. Some pant after the Du&s;t of the Earth, <HI>Amos</HI> 2.7.

And what can follow but Di&s;&s;atisfaction and Mi|&s;ery? Acquaintance with God is the only way to be freed from a nece&s;&s;ity of Sin and Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Acquaintance with God is the Duty of Man, becau&s;e God him&s;elf doth acquaint him|&s;elf with Man. Shall the King &s;eek after Ac|quaintance with the meane&s;t of his Subject, and he refu&s;e Acquaintance with his Sovereign? Shall God acquaint him&s;elf with Man, and &s;hall not Man acquaint him&s;elf with God? It is ex|pected among Men, that the Inferiour &s;hould &s;eek for Acquaintance with the Superiour, and not the Superiour with the Inferiour; but yet God out of his wonderful Love hath &s;ought fir&s;t to Man for Acquaintance. Thus <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.31. It is &s;aid concerning the Son of God, who is meant by <HI>the Eternal Wi&s;dom of the Father, that he rejoyced in the habitable Parts of the Earth, and his Delight was with the Sons of Men.</HI> If God thus delights in Conver&s;e and Acquaintance with the Sons of Men, how much more ought Men to rejoice in Conver&s;e and Acquaintance with God? <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 65.1. God &s;aith, <HI>I am found of them that &s;ought me not.</HI> All Men were departed from God, and not a Man that did &s;eek after God; there is none that under&s;tands of &s;eeks after God, yet God is found of them.

He &s;eeks to dwell among the Rebellious; is it not fit that Man &s;hould en|ter into Acquaintance with God, when God doth thus acquaint him&s;elf with Man?

<P>Secondly, Is there to be Acquaintance between the Soul and God? Then let us learn to make a right Judgment of our own Excellency; let us judge of our &s;elves as too high and noble to con|ver&s;e with this ba&s;e and beggerly World. I am of a nobler Original, than to deba&s;e my &s;elf to &s;uch mean things; I am the Off-&s;pring of God, and &s;hall I acquaint my &s;elf with Earth? I am of the Family of God, and &s;hall I conver&s;e with Sa|tan? Is there Bread enough in my Father's Hou&s;e, and &s;hall I peri&s;h for Hunger? Lift up thy &s;elf, O my Soul, &s;hake off the Intanglements of the Fle&s;h, break out of that Bondage of the Devil, trample upon the Glory of the World, and &s;corn to let out thy precious De&s;ires upon Dung and Dro&s;s; get the Moon under thy Feet, cloath thy &s;elf with the Sun, put on the Son of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, come into the Palace of God, and acquaint thy &s;elf with him, for this is thy Glory, this is thy Excellency. Ye precious ones, who can call God Father, and the Son Brother, who have Fellow&s;hip with the Father and the Son, who may have Communion with the Holy Gho&s;t? What do you lying among the Pots? What do you raking in Dunghills? What do you conver&s;ing with the World? Have a holy Scorn of the&s;e things, as below the Dignity of your Souls: know your Worth, e&s;teem of your &s;elves, as of more value than all the&s;e lower Trea&s;ures. This is your Glory and your Excellency, that ye are of God's Acquaintance, that ye are Sons of God, Heirs of God, and Joint-Heirs with Chri&s;t, that ye under&s;tand and know God.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="78">There are two things wherein mo&s;t Men are mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, In the Nature of <HI>Pride.</HI> Some look upon that only as Pride, which manife&s;teth it &s;elf in co&s;tly Apparel, and bodily Ornaments, beyond the Degree and Rank of the Per&s;on. Some look no further than the Carriage of one Man to|wards another. Now favourably con&s;ider with me, that the greate&s;t Pride in the World is Man's undue E&s;teem of him&s;elf toward God; and this is in the Heart of every one by Nature. Every one by Nature doth lift up him&s;elf again&s;t God, goes about to dethrone God, and to crown him|&s;elf: Every one takes Coun&s;el in his Heart again&s;t the Lord, &s;aying, <HI>Let us break his Bands a&s;under, and ca&s;t his Cords from us.</HI> This is the Voice of eve|ry one that dares wilfully to &s;in, <HI>We will not have God to rule over us.</HI> Yet this is the working of the Pride of a Man again&s;t God, to thru&s;t God out of the Throne of his Maje&s;ty, and to &s;et him&s;elf in. For what is God's Glory and Re&s;pect among his Creatures? Is it not this; that he being the <HI>Begin|ning,</HI> and <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>all,</HI> &s;hould be likewi&s;e the <HI>End</HI> of <HI>all?</HI> And this is the very Purpo&s;e of God in making of Man, that having received him&s;elf from God, he &s;hould have what he might freely give up to God; &s;o that all Man is, and all that he hath, is to be offered to God, as the End and Cen|ter of all. Now a &s;inning Creature brings God under to &s;erve him, to provide for-him. Now though this Pride of Man again&s;t God be not &s;o much taken notice of, yet it is the very daring Sin of the World. It is indeed to be wondred at, that ever Creatures did ca&s;t out the fir&s;t Thoughts of &s;uch an Attempt. Now con&s;ider how far Man's
<PB N="40" REF="79">Pride is from his true Excellency in his Union with God. We are therefore to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween that high E&s;teem that Man is to have of him&s;elf, and Pride. For Man to look upon him|&s;elf as a <HI>noble Being,</HI> and of a Rank above all the <HI>natural World,</HI> it is not Pride, for thus he is (be|ing a &s;piritual under&s;tanding Agent) in a Capa|city of being acquainted with God, of being u|nited to God, and, as I may &s;ay, of exchanging him&s;elf with God.</P>
<P>Secondly, Another Mi&s;take of mo&s;t Men, is concerning their <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Excellency,</HI> and in the Rule and Mea&s;ure of their <HI>Excellency.</HI> Mo&s;t mea&s;ure their Dignity by the Advantage which they have over others in this World: As &s;ome in their Power and Authority; &s;ome in their Friends and Relations; &s;ome in their Riches and E&s;tates; &s;ome in their Wi&s;dom and Faculties; &s;ome in their Strength and Power. And what more uni|ver&s;al Evil is there than this, for every one in &s;omething or other to lift him&s;elf up in his own E&s;teem, and in his Thoughts to tread upon others, as &s;omething inferiour to him&s;elf? But Men lie blinded in their own Delu&s;ions, not con&s;idering what is the true Excellency of Man; nor know the right Rule by which Man's Worth is to be judged of. The way for us to judge rightly con|cerning our &s;elves, is to &s;ee how we &s;tand to|wards God. God is the Perfection of Excellen|cy; and the nigher we are to God, the greater is our Excellency. This is the Greatne&s;s of a Na|tion, to be nigh to God, <HI>Deut.</HI> 4.7. <HI>What Nation is there &s;o great which hath God &s;o nigh unto them?</HI> And <HI>Amos</HI> 8.7. God is called the Excellency of <HI>Jacob.</HI> God &s;weareth not by any thing below
<PB N="41" REF="80">him&s;elf; therefore God is here meant. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 60.19. God is called the <HI>Glory of his People. The Lord &s;hall be to thee an everla&s;ting Light, and thy God thy Glory.</HI> Now God is the Glory of tho&s;e that are acquainted with him.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, By Virtue of the Relation wherein God &s;tands towards them. An intimate Relation to tho&s;e that are Per&s;ons of Dignity and Worth, doth communicate Worth and Dignity to tho&s;e who are &s;o related to them. As the Son of a mean Man is not &s;o highly valued and e&s;teemed as the Son of a Prince. <HI>David</HI> reckoned it to be a great thing to be Son-in-Law to a King, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 18.18. <HI>Who am I, and what is my Life, or my Fa|ther's Family in</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>that I &s;hould be Son-in-Law to the King?</HI> Thus are we to reckon it our Dig|nity and Excellency to be in nigh Relation to God, to be Sons of God, to be Heirs of God, and to be the Friends of God; what greater Honour than this, to be in &s;uch a nigh Relation to the God of Glory? Now the Excellency that we have from this Relation, ari&s;eth from the Excellency of that Act which is the Foundation of this Rela|tion, and that is our being born of God, as we are Sons, <HI>John</HI> 1.12, 13. God marrying us to him&s;elf as he is our Husband, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3. <HI>Turn,</HI> O <HI>back|&s;liding Children, &s;aith the Lord, for I am married unto you.</HI> God takes us into Fellow&s;hip and Communi|on, and Acquaintance with him&s;elf, as he makes us his Friends, and his Acquaintance. This Act of God doth in&s;tamp a Worth and Excellency up|on Man, as the Impre&s;&s;ion of the King's Seal up|on Wax, and makes it of value, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.4. It is here &s;poken as the Glory of the Servants of God, <HI>Tho&s;e that follow the Lamb, they &s;hall &s;ee his Face, and
<PB N="42" REF="81">his Name &s;hall be in their Foreheads;</HI> that is, God hath cho&s;en, and as it were, marked them out for his own: and this marking them, and owning them, it &s;ets a high Dignity upon them, &s;uch as &s;ecures them from the Cur&s;e that is to be upon all be&s;ides; as <HI>Rev.</HI> 9.4. They are commanded to hurt none <HI>but tho&s;e who have not the Seal of God in their Foreheads.</HI> This Relation of the Soul to God, gives the Soul an Excellency, as it doth intere&s;t the Soul in the Glory and Excellency of God him&s;elf; they are God's, and God is theirs, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.16. <HI>I will dwell in them, and walk with them, and I will be their God, and they &s;hall be my People,</HI> ver. 17. He argues from the Dignity of this Relation, that they &s;hould count them&s;elves too good to conver&s;e with the World; <HI>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye &s;eparated, &s;aith the Lord, and touch no unclean thing: and I will receive you, and be a Father to you, and you &s;hall be my Sons and Daugh|ters, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> Thus you &s;ee the Dignity that is upon the Soul by its Acquaintance with God. Our relation to God in our Acquaintance with him, doth enoble us, lift us above the World, make us that we are too good for the Company of tho&s;e that are not acquainted with God. It is then no Pride in us thus to e&s;teem of our &s;elves, to have high Thoughts of our &s;elves, becau&s;e of that Ac|quaintance which our Souls are to have with God. It is Pride for to think too highly of our &s;elves: But it is Sobriety to think of our &s;elves according to that Acquaintance which we have with God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.3. <HI>I &s;ay, through the Grace of God given to me, to every one that is among you, not to think of him&s;elf more highly than he ought to think; but to think &s;oberly according as God hath
<PB N="43" REF="82">dealt to every Man the Mea&s;ure of Faith.</HI> Here the Apo&s;tle commands them to mea&s;ure the E&s;teem which they have of them&s;elves, by the Mea&s;ure of Faith which they have from God; becau&s;e by Faith they come to be valued excellent in the Eye of God. So likewi&s;e we are to mea&s;ure our E&s;teem which we have of our &s;elves, by the Mea|&s;ure of our Acquaintance which we have with God: becau&s;e by Acquaintance with him, we come to be truly excellent. And while we do thus, we &s;hall not think more highly of our &s;elves than we ought to think; for while we account our &s;elves excellent becau&s;e of our Acquaintance with God, we in lifting up our &s;elves magnify God; and while we thus glory, we glory in the Lord, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.31. But now herein we are to beware of two things.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That we di&s;tingui&s;h carefully between our Capacity of being acquainted with God, and our being actually acquainted with him: for our Capacity, or being &s;o as that we may be acquain|ted with God, is of no Worth, unle&s;s we be actu|ally acquainted with him. We are in a remote Capacity naturally as Men, and we are in a more nigh Capacity by the Mercy and Covenant of God; but this adds no true Worth to the Soul without the actual Acquaintance of the Soul with God. Yea, Man is the wor&s;e for this, if he be without the other; for if Man being made fit for Enjoy|ment of God, and Communion with him, never attain to an Enjoyment of him, he becomes more vile than tho&s;e things who&s;e Nature is inferiour, if they attain to the Perfection of that Nature. And it is like to fare wor&s;e with Man, if he fall &s;hort of the Glory of God, becau&s;e he was capa|ble
<PB N="44" REF="83">of the Glory of God, than with Bea&s;ts which are not capable of it. And again, in regard of that more nigh Capacity wherein we are by Je|&s;us Chri&s;t of Acquaintance with God; if we are not really acquainted with God, we &s;hall thereby not only have no Addition of Excellency, but thereby we &s;hall be more vile and mi&s;erable: and therefore tho&s;e who through the Mercy of God have been in the vi&s;ible Church, and have heard of the good Will of God to Man through Chri&s;t, and know that God is ready to entertain them into Acquaintance with him&s;elf; if they &s;hall fall &s;hort of this, their Condemnation will be greater than that of tho&s;e who never heard of God's Invitation, and his Grace in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If we therefore &s;hall glory in our Capacity of being of the Acquaintance of God, and neglect to be really acquainted with him, we do but as the <HI>Jews</HI> of old, who cried out, <HI>The Temple of the Lord are the&s;e,</HI> Jer. 7.4. And the nigher we are to God, if we do not come to a thorow Clo|&s;ure with him, the nigher we are to the Stroke of his Wrath: as the nigher any is to Mu&s;quet|&s;hot, the greater will the Force of it be upon him. Di&s;tingui&s;h therefore between our Capa|city of being acquainted with God, and our actual Acquaintance with him.</P>
<P>Secondly, We mu&s;t beware le&s;t in our E&s;teem of our &s;elves, we lay the Foundation of our Glo|ry in our &s;elves. There is that in every ones cor|rupt Nature which doth provoke him to it: &s;o that I dare boldly &s;ay, that there is not a Man in his corrupt natural State, who doth not &s;ome way or other lift up him&s;elf in his own E&s;teem for &s;omething of his own. And we are apt to
<PB N="45" REF="84">make every &s;piritual Excellency to be matter for Pride and Self-conceitedne&s;s. We do not &s;uffi|ciently eye God as the Fountain, the Author, the Foundation, the Rule and Pattern of all our Excellency. Such is the way wherein God re|ceiveth Man to Acquaintance with him&s;elf, that he might hide Pride from his Eyes, and that no Fle&s;h might glory in his Pre&s;ence, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.29. If we therefore lay the Foundation of our Glory in our &s;elves, and plea&s;e our &s;elves in the Sparks that we have kindled, we &s;hall glory in our Shame, and lie down in Sorrow. This high E&s;teem which we are to have of our &s;elves, be|cau&s;e of our Acquaintance with God, it doth not at all contradict that precious Grace of Humility, but they rather help forward one another; for the more any e&s;teems of him&s;elf, becau&s;e of that re|lation which he hath to God, the le&s;s is the E|&s;teem of him&s;elf, becau&s;e of any thing of his own; the more we make God the matter of our Glory, the le&s;s do we glory in our &s;elves. The more we apprehend of our Excellency being from God, the le&s;s account do we make of all other &s;eem|ing Excellencies. When the Light of the Sun ari&s;eth, then all Star-light di&s;appears.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, All Dignity we have, &s;eems to ari&s;e from that relation which we have to God in Ac|quaintance with him.</P>
<P>Secondly, By Acquaintance with God, we come to have an ab&s;olute po&s;itive Dignity which is real in our Per&s;ons, yet &s;till depending up|on God. As by our Union with Chri&s;t we come to have a Righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed, which is our ju&s;tification; and a Righteou&s;ne&s;s likewi&s;e in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erent, which is our Sanctification; &s;o by our
<PB N="46" REF="85">Acquaintance with God, we have a Dignity, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it were, imputed by our Relation to God, and a Dignity real, which is that Excellency where|by we are made ab&s;olutely better. By Acquain|tance with God, we come to be like God; and the Image of God in us, is the greate&s;t Excel|lency that we are capable of. When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had been fourty days in the Mount with God, his Face did &s;hine with &s;uch a Brightne&s;s, that the People could not behold him: &s;o tho&s;e that con|ver&s;e with God, they retain a Lu&s;ter, which &s;hines in their Conver&s;e with Men. The Image or Picture of any worthy Per&s;on, is e&s;teemed by them that e&s;teem the Per&s;on; and this E&s;teem of it, is from a relation which it hath to that Per|&s;on; but now the Children of any Per&s;on whom we love, being a lively Image of their Father's Per&s;on, have another Value upon them, having not only a Relation worthy, becau&s;e of their Re&s;emblance in the outward Lineament, buts real Participation of Nature and Di&s;po&s;ition which they receive from their Father: So there is an Excellency in tho&s;e that are acquainted with God, not only as being in relation to him, but as receiving, and being Partakers of the Divine Nature. As Children learn to pronounce their Words according to the Pronunciation of the Mother, or Nur&s;e with whom they conver&s;e, (as every one is apt to be formed unto the man|ner and di&s;po&s;ition of the Company wherein they mo&s;t u&s;ually are) thus tho&s;e who conver&s;e with God, they become in &s;ome mea&s;ure like unto God; and this is po&s;itive per&s;onal Excellency which tho&s;e have which conver&s;e with God Thus the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> argueth concerning that
<PB N="47" REF="86">Perfection of Glory and Excellency, which here|after is to be upon tho&s;e that are the Sons of God. <HI>But it doth not yet appear what we &s;hall be: but we know that when he &s;hall appear, we &s;hall be like him, for we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is.</HI> In Heaven we &s;hall be like God, becau&s;e we &s;hall &s;ee God; and on Earth tho&s;e that conver&s;e with God, &s;hall in &s;ome mea&s;ure be like God, according to their mea&s;ure of Acquaintance with him. And &s;o <HI>Paul</HI> argues concerning this pre&s;ent Life, 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>But we all with open Face beholding, as in a Gla&s;s, the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> Here we &s;ee clearly that be|holding the Glory of the Lord, doth change in|to the &s;ame Image of God, and likewi&s;e that this Image of God only is the Glory of Man; for that is meant by, <HI>from Glory to Glory:</HI> that is, from one degree of glorious Similitude, to ano|ther degree of glorious Re&s;emblance and Like|ne&s;s to God. Thus ye have &s;een that the Excel|lency of Man con&s;i&s;teth in his Acquaintance with God; and that by the virtue of his relation to God, he hath an imputed Excellency; and an Excellency by his Propriety in God, in whom is all Excellency; and that by his Conver&s;e with God, and Acquaintance with him, he becomes eally like God, which is his inherent Excellen|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y. Let us then reckon of our &s;elves as tho&s;e who have their Dignity and Excellency from God, and in this let us glory, That we know God, and are acquainted with God.

<P>Secondly, I &s;hall be the more earne&s;t in pre&s;|&s;ing you upon a diligent Search into what Ac|quaintance you have gotten with God; becau&s;e, I know that tho&s;e that have lea&s;t Acquaintance with God, are mo&s;t apt to neglect this Enquiry, It may be a tender Soul that hath been much with God, will be ready upon the fir&s;t Hint to enter into the Secrets of its own Heart, to look over his Evidences, to call to mind, when have I drawn nigh to God? When have I conver&s;ed with God? When have I Communion with God? Hath my Life been a walking with God? Have I dwelt with God, and made my Abode with him? Thus the Soul that makes high Ac|count of its Acquaintance with God, will be
<PB N="50" REF="89">trying and examining it &s;elf; and it may be up|on its more awakened Signs of its &s;ometimes de|parting from God, or feeling &s;ome pre&s;ent &s;trange|ne&s;s, it will be apt to conclude of it &s;elf, &s;urely I am none of tho&s;e precious ones, who&s;e Life is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Conver&s;e with God.

Let me therefore urge you with all Earne&s;tne&s;s, that you will not ac|count it a &s;mall marter, whether you be ac|quainted with God or not; and &s;o neglect this Trial of your &s;elves: But bring your Hearts up roundly to the Examination, yield not to their unrea&s;onable with drawings, force them to an&s;wer. If you make any Account of the Charge of God, if you make any Account of the Excellency of Man, if you would not lo&s;e the highe&s;t Privi|lege of the Creature, if you have any E&s;teem of the Life of Heaven, know your &s;elves in this, whether you are in a State of Acquaintance with God, and be &s;erious and diligent in this Enquiry.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Becau&s;e Men are &s;o exceeding apt to be mi&s;taken, and to mi&s;apprehend concern|ing them&s;elves, that they are in a State of Ac|quaintance with God, while they are meer Stran|gers unto him; &s;uch as tho&s;e whom our Saviour &s;peaks of, <HI>Matth.</HI> 7.22, 23. <HI>Many will &s;ay to me in that Day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophe&s;ied in thy Name, and in thy Name have ca&s;t out Devils, and in thy Name done many wonderful Works?</HI> And then he will profe&s;s unto them, <HI>I never knew you: depart from me ye Workers of Iniquity.</HI> They take it for granted, that becau&s;e of &s;uch Privileges, and Gifts, and common Graces which they had, therefore they were well ac|quainted with Chri&s;t; but our Saviour an&s;wer|eth, <HI>I never knew you;</HI> that is, I never had any Acquaintance with you. Such are tho&s;e who are re&s;embled to us by five fooli&s;h Virgins, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25.11. The five fooli&s;h Virgins come when the Door is &s;hut, and &s;ay, <HI>Lord, Lord, open
<PB N="52" REF="91">unto us; but he an&s;wereth, Verily I &s;ay unto you, I know you not;</HI> that is, never had Acquaintance with you: you never knew me in the time of your Life, and I will not know you now: You were a&s;hamed to own me before Men, and I will be a&s;hamed to own you before my Father. Men are &s;o apt to be mi&s;taken in Judgment of them&s;elves, that they think them&s;elves rich and encrea&s;ing with Goods, and to have need of no|thing; when they are wretched, mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked. And this makes <HI>David, P&s;al.</HI> 139.24. to cry out after he had been trying him&s;elf, <HI>Search me, O God, and know my Heart; try me, and know my Thoughts, and &s;ee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everla&s;ting.</HI> This Unaptne&s;s in us to make a right Judgment of our &s;elves in our re|lation to God, ari&s;eth,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, From that deep Root of Self-love that is in us by Nature, whereby we are apt to ap|prehend well of our &s;elves, and be plea&s;ed with a good Conceit of our &s;elves, though we are never &s;o bad. And &s;uch is the Nature of this Affection, that it blinds our Eyes, and prejudi|ceth the Mind, that it cannot make a right Judgment. As Affection in &s;ome Parents to their Children, makes them reckon that which is a Blemi&s;h, to be a Beauty in their Children; &s;o doth inordinare Self-love work in Men, in the Judgment of them&s;elves. Men when they judge them&s;elves, they look into a flattering Gla&s;s which pre&s;ents them in greater Beauty than that which is their own.</P>
<P>Secondly, We judge ami&s;s of our &s;elves, becau&s;e we take not a right Rule for our Judgments, as
<PB N="53" REF="92">tho&s;e whom <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.12. <HI>Some commend them&s;elves, but they mea&s;ure them&s;elves by them&s;elves, and comparing them&s;elves with them&s;elves, are not wi&s;e.</HI> If we take our &s;elves to be the Rule and Mea&s;ure, then we cannot di&s;cern our own Crookedne&s;s and Irregularne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We judge ami&s;s of our &s;elves, be|cau&s;e of the Deceitfulne&s;s of our Hearts. <HI>The Heart of Man is deceitful above all things, and de&s;pe|rately wicked; who can know it?</HI> Jer. 17.9. <HI>Gro&s;s Wickedne&s;s is apparent to the pur-blind Eye:</HI> But where there is an ab&s;taining from gro&s;s outward Sins, there are &s;pecial Workings of Corruption, &s;uch as Pride, Self-love, di&s;tru&s;t of God, and love of the World; any of which &s;hut up the Soul again&s;t God, as with Bolts and Bars; and the&s;e lying inward are not di&s;cerned. Other Accounts may be given of the Unaptne&s;s to make a due Judgment of our &s;elves: It concerns us therefore to be exact in our Trial, and tru&s;t not to a &s;udden An&s;wer; for we are ready to make a &s;hort Work of it, and to &s;ave our &s;elves the Labour, and to &s;it down with charitable Thoughts of our &s;elves. What&s;oever An&s;wer therefore our Hearts give us, let us &s;ee cleared, and have &s;uch Rea&s;on for it, that we may know how to proceed with our &s;elves, upon a right Judgment of our &s;elves. The chief Work of Trial in this particular Acquaintance with God, will be from tho&s;e Particulars wherein I opened the Nature of the Soul's Acquaintance with God. Let us therefore take tho&s;e Heads and our own Experience of our &s;elves, and by a rational De|duction, let us find out our own E&s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="93">As thus, Tho&s;e that are acquainted with God are brought night to God. Whereas &s;ometimes there was a Strangene&s;s and Remotene&s;s, a va&s;t Separation, now the Partition is taken out of the way, and I am made one in Chri&s;t. I have took God to be my Portion, and my Father; I have been a Prodigal, and have departed from him; but I finding my &s;elf lo&s;t and undone, and that nothing could &s;atisfy my Soul in the World, therefore I re&s;olved I would return to my Fa|ther's Hou&s;e, and try if he would receive me again into his Family; and &s;o I have done. I have ca&s;t off my old Conver&s;e with the World, and with Corruption; I have broken my League with Hell, and have entred into a Covenant with the Father, through his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t; therefore I may comfortably conclude that I am now in a State of Acquaintance with God.</P>
<P>But if in the Enquiry into my &s;elf I find not the&s;e things, if I find that now I am as in former Days; I have felt no &s;uch Change in my &s;elf, and that all things are with me as they were of old; I never was &s;en&s;ible of any Lo&s;s in my &s;elf; I ne|ver knew what Strangene&s;s and Nighne&s;s to God meant; I never under&s;tood what Union with God, and Di&s;tance from God was; this &s;igni|fies ill, it is a Symptom of a bad State, of a State of Unacquaintance with God.</P>
<P N="2">2. So again, for our Conver&s;e with God. He that is acquainted with God, he hath had his Conver&s;e with God, he hath dwelt with God, and God with him; he hath &s;upped with Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t with him; his great Bu&s;ine&s;s and Em|ployment hath been nigh God, in tho&s;e things
<PB N="55" REF="94">wherein is mo&s;t of God. If I find my Soul much conver&s;ing with God, oft &s;ending out Breathings to Heaven, oft ca&s;ting my Eye towards God, if I find the great Work of my Mind to be with God, my great Bu&s;ine&s;s lies in Heaven, my Trea&s;ure is laid up there, and my Thoughts, and De&s;ires, and Joys, and Delights, and Medi|tations are there; I may comfortably conclude that I am in &s;ome mea&s;ure acquainted with God. But if in the Inquiry into my &s;elf, I find that I have my whole Conver&s;e with the World, that I can afford no time for Prayer to God in my Family, and in &s;ecret; if I find all the Day long my Cares, and De&s;ires, and Thoughts, run out mo&s;t naturally and &s;ully without Control to|wards the things of the World, or that I will mind my &s;elf in a natural carnal way, and mind not the things of God; this &s;ignifies to me my Unacquaintance with God, and it will be an ungrounded Pre&s;umption in me to reckon of my &s;elf any other than a Stranger to him.</P>
<P N="3">3. So for Communion and Fellow&s;hip, which is in Acquaintance. Tho&s;e that are intimately acquainted, their Communion in the way of Di&s;cour&s;e is very frequent, in making known their Thoughts and Appre|hen&s;ions, their Fears and Wants; their Minds are open one to another, and that which is the Propriety of one, is by their Acquaintance communicated to the u&s;e of both. If then I can find in reviewing the Workings of my Soul, that there hath been this Sight of Heaven, this Spi|ritual Communion between my Soul and God; that my Heart hath been open to God; that I have gone to God when my Heart hath
<PB N="56" REF="95">been burdened with Sorrow, I have di&s;charged it into the Bo&s;om of God, as into the Bo&s;om of a Friend; that in my Doubts I have betaken my &s;elf to him, expecting Comfort from him; that upon hearing his Voice I have opened to him, and upon my opening he hath come in with Smiles of Love, and given me Tokens of his Favour; the&s;e things &s;ignifie a State of Acquaintance with God; but if I know not what it is to have given up my Soul to God, to be his, and to have taken God to be mine; if I have had Experience of receiving no|thing el&s;e from God, but a partaking of the things of the World; if I have not been wont to com|municate the Workings of my Mind to God, it betokeneth my Unacquaintance with God.</P>
<P N="4">4. And again, For that friendly Working of Love and Affection in the Soul towards God. Tho&s;e that are in a State of Acquaintance are &s;up|po&s;ed to comply with each other in Kindne&s;s, and Love, and Good-will, and Affection. If then I can upon &s;earch into my &s;elf, find that God hath the highe&s;t Room in my Affections, that my Heart is his, that his Love is prevailing with me, above the Love of all things be&s;ide, and that I love tho&s;e that are his beloved for his Sake, then I have in me a Sign of real Acquaintance with God; for Love is the very Quinte&s;&s;ence of Acquaintance: but if in the Search into the Workings of my Mind I can find no &s;uch friendly Compliance, but that God was &s;till thwarting and cro&s;&s;ing my De&s;igns, that I &s;hould find my &s;elf better content if there were no God, and that tho&s;e Workings of my Mind that are about God are &s;ower, har&s;h, and tearing upon my Spirit, then it is to be feared, that I have no Acquaintance with God.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="96">And ha&s;t thou made an impartial Inquiry into thy State? And how &s;tand things between thy Soul and God? Art thou acquainted with him, or art thou not? Con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, O Sinners, that this is one of the weightie&s;t Que&s;tions in the World; and if this Que&s;tion were but well re&s;ol|ved, it would put an end to a thou&s;and other Que|&s;tions. He that can &s;ay of God and Chri&s;t, this is my Beloved, and this is my Friend, he need not very &s;olicitou&s;ly ask, What News? He hath heard good News from Heaven, which will ea&s;ily bal|lance all; come what will come, he need not much fear, as long as there &s;tands that one Text in the Bible; <HI>That all &s;hall work together for good to them that love God.</HI> He hath no Cau&s;e to go a begging to the World, and to &s;ay, <HI>Who will &s;hew me any Good?</HI> as long as the Lord hath &s;hined up|on him with the Light of his Countenance. He need not complain, What &s;hall I do? I have lo&s;t this or that dear Friend; when he hath found him, who can make up all with one Look, whom he can never lo&s;e. In a word, He need not ask, How &s;hall I do to live? and what &s;hall I eat, and what &s;hall I drink, and wherewithall &s;hall I be clothed? So long as he knows that he hath a No|ble Friend, who will ea&s;e him of all his Care, and never &s;ee him want. Well then, ha&s;t thou an|&s;wered this great Que&s;tion or not?

<P><HI>Eleventhly,</HI> He is a &s;uitable Friend. It is Suitable|ne&s;s that &s;weetens Society. I can ea&s;ily believe, a poor Country Pea&s;ant can take as much Con|tent in the Company of a poor Man like him&s;elf, as in the Society of a Prince; an unlearned Coun|try Man is no way fit to conver&s;e with Courtiers, and States-Men; the Va&s;tne&s;s of the Di&s;tance would &s;o much &s;wallow his Mind, and the Un&s;uit|ablene&s;s of his Spirit to &s;uch Company takes off that Content which otherwi&s;e he might enjoy. But yet in Spirituals, though the Di&s;tance between God and Man be beyond a Po&s;&s;ibility of our Con|ception,
<PB N="133" REF="172">and the Di&s;proportion infinite; yet the Soul of Man being immediately from God, and Spiritual like God, and having a Divine new Nature infu&s;ed into it by the Spirit in Regenerati|on, it finds an infinite Suitablene&s;s, Plea&s;ure and Content in the Injoyment of God's Pre&s;ence, and it is not &s;unk, but rai&s;ed by an Union, Conver&s;e and Society with its Maker. The Truth of it is, did Man but under&s;tand his own Original a-right, he would think it infinitely below his noble Pa|rentage to conver&s;e with, and have intimate de|lightful Society with any but God, and tho&s;e which bare the &s;ame Relation to God with him|&s;elf, or to bring poor Strangers acquainted with him as well as them&s;elves. There is not a Match upon Earth fit for the Soul of Man to be matched to: But in that other Country there is a Match indeed every way &s;uitable, a Spirit for a Spirit, an everla&s;ting God for an everla&s;ting Soul, a precious Je&s;us for a precious Soul, a holy God for tho&s;e which he hath made holy like him&s;elf; and that is none of the lea&s;t of Man's Happine&s;s, that notwith&s;tanding that infinite Di&s;tance that is naturally between him and his God, yet that God &s;hould make in his Creature &s;uch noble Di&s;po&s;iti|ons, and &s;uch Divine Qualifications, that there &s;hould be the greate&s;t Suitablene&s;s in the World between God and the Soul, and the Soul and God; and they both take wonderful Content in the En|joyment of one another. This is in part here, but compleated in Glory. This we may find oft in Scripture expre&s;&s;ed in the neare&s;t Relations, and deare&s;t Affections. Hence God is &s;aid to be a Father, and they his Children; a Husband, and they his Spou&s;e. Now what greater Suita|blene&s;s

When was he quite out of the hearing of their Cry? Know indeed he may hide him&s;elf, yet then he is near them al&s;o, to try their Love, and hear their Voice, for God loves to hear his Children cry; (earthly Parents may correct their Children for crying, but God cha&s;ti&s;eth his Children u&s;ually for their Silence.) When he &s;eems furthe&s;t off, he is but behind the Curtain, he is there where he with Plea&s;ure &s;ees how earne&s;tly his Children look up and down for him: And then when they are ready to &s;it down weeping as if they had lo&s;t their Father; when they think they are quite forgot, and their Enemies be|gin to triumph, and to ask, Where now is your God? Then he lets both Friends and Foes know that he is near. And what &s;ay you to all this, you that as yet are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">trangers to God? Have you gotten &s;uch a Friend as he is, that will always be at your Elbow, that can and will come to help you (when other Friends are far enough off) whe|ther Man will or no?

No good Man is without the Com|pany of God, he walks with God, he talks with God, he eats with God, he drinks with God, and is entertained by him, and he &s;leeps in his Arms. God is with him in his Shop, in the Rode, at Home and Abroad, and who can mi&s;|carry that hath &s;o helpful a Companion always with him? When thy Burdens are too heavy, do but complain, and he will either take them off thy Back, or put under his own Shoulders, and help

God is the great Soul Friend; expect not to find him a Friend to thy Lu&s;t, this &s;cares the Wicked from him, who would be glad to be acquainted with God, if he would gratify their Lu&s;ts, and plea&s;e their wicked Humours, and give them eternal Happi|ne&s;s after a Life of Wickedne&s;s, that is, would ungod him&s;elf for their &s;akes. But hold there Man; you &s;hall &s;ooner &s;ee the Sun black, and have Fire cold, and find a Heaven in Hell, than have God a Friend to your Sins. God doth not promi&s;e to furni&s;h all his Acquaintance with Pro|vi&s;ion for their Sen&s;uality, he will not put a Knife into thy Hands to &s;tab him&s;elf, or to cut thy own Throat.

Multitude of Acquaintance, &s;uch as they are, may contribute much to a Man's Care and Sorrow. And as for mo&s;t Friends, &s;uch as are commonly &s;o called, it is better to have their Room than their Company. A Man may live without the Acquaintance of Nobles, he may be as free, chearful, and rich without the Know|ledge of &s;uch as them. One may live holily, and die joyfully, and may be happy for ever, though he never &s;aw the Face of a Prince, though he was never at Court, though he lived and died a Stran|ger to all worldly Friends. One may be di&s;own|ed by his Father, hated by his Mother, &s;lighted

And him that hath the Company of God in Acquaintance with his Redeemer I'll call happy, though he have never a Friend in the World be&s;ides. Multitude of Friends &s;eldom add much to our Comforts, but always to our Cares. A Man may go to Hell for all his great Acquaintance with Men; but it's im|po&s;&s;ible, if we are greatly acquainted with God, to mi&s;s of Heaven. When Men are unkind, if God be kind, it's well ballanced; but if God frown, who&s;e Smiles can comfort?

We are kept by the mighty Power of God through Faith unto Salvation. If they had been of us, &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, no doubt they would have continued with us. It is po&s;&s;i|ble indeed, yea, common for Men to pretend Love to God, and to &s;eem to have a true Friend&s;hip for him, and yet not to be truly &s;o. To have a Name to live, and to live, are two things. It is not unu&s;ual to bare God company (as I may &s;ay) abroad, and yet at home to have &s;ome body that they have a greater Kindne&s;s for. It is common to go along with God (if I may &s;o call it) in the external Actions of Religion, and yet to de&s;ert him at la&s;t, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 58.1, 2, 3. <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.21.

<PB N="163" REF="202">given him many tran&s;ient Vi&s;its, but yet they want the real Properties of Friends: they never knew what it was to be brought nigh to the Fa|ther, by the Son; to have a Sen&s;e of their lo&s;t State and E&s;trangement from God, and under a Sen&s;e of this, to make earne&s;t Inquiry after him; they never knew what it was to conver&s;e with God, to have an intimate Acquaintance with him, to be &s;ending out the Breathings of their Souls af|ter him, and to be un&s;atisfied without him; they took up a Trade of lifele&s;s Duties, and that was all. As for the Life and Power of Religion they never under&s;tood it; Communion with God, they heard oft of, but never under&s;tood what it meant, they never &s;avoured and reli&s;hed the things of God, nor with any Suitablene&s;s or Complacency ingaged in his Service: And as for tho&s;e more &s;e|cret Actings of Religion, to take up the Intere&s;t of God, to de&s;ign his Glory, to be deeply con|cerned for his Honour, ob&s;erving their Affecti|ons, and the Workings of their Hearts in Duty; to take notice of An&s;wers of Prayers, or to look after their Petitions, when they are out of their Mouths, they know not what the&s;e things are. So that from hence it appears that God and they were never really acquainted; no wonder then that they do for&s;ake God, and are for&s;aken of him.

<PB N="164" REF="203">is impo&s;&s;ible that God &s;hould for&s;ake &s;uch a one.

Nay, I may &s;ay, I believe that there are very few of them which know what God's Pre&s;ence, Smiles and Love is, but know in &s;ome mea&s;ure what it is to have his Face hid, to walk in the dark, and to &s;ee no Light. It is no unu&s;ual thing of a Child of God to que&s;tion his State, to fear whether all that he ever did were not in Hypocri&s;y and For|mality; have not the be&s;t been made &s;ometimes to que&s;tion (e&s;pecially upon &s;ome notable Fall) whether what they did formerly did not pro|ceed from meer common Grace, or &s;ome le&s;s &s;pi|ritual Principle than the Life of Grace, and a Di|vine Nature within them. Were there ever any of the Sons of <HI>Adam,</HI> whom rich Mercy hath plucked as Fire-brands out of the Fire, to whom the Lord hath &s;hewed his marvellous Kindne&s;s, and Love in Chri&s;t, that hath kept their Watch &s;o exactly, that have walked &s;o clo&s;ely with God, &s;o as never to have the lea&s;t Frown from him? Were

A Child of God may oft be in a &s;ad State, but yet he is always in a &s;afe State: The Purpo&s;e of God &s;tands firm. Though for a &s;mall Moment he &s;eem to for&s;ake them, yet with everla&s;ting Mercies will he gather them? O Ever|la&s;ting!

If thou bee&s;t once truly ac|quainted with God, thy State is as &s;afe, thy Con|dition as &s;ure as if thou wer't already in Heaven. God may and will cha&s;ti&s;e his with Rods, but his loving Kindne&s;s he will never remove from them, his Mercy indures for ever. All that God gives to his Friends and Acquaintance, that is &s;pi|ritual, is like him&s;elf, Everla&s;ting. God is not like &s;hort-&s;pirited Man, every Moment changing, one day doating upon an Object, and the next day hating it as much. An earthly Prince may one Moment &s;et his Favourite at his Table, and the next command that he &s;hould be hanged. But far be it from the unchangeable God, that he &s;hould do thus. As for the great ones of the World; it hath been counted by &s;ome, and tho&s;e none of the weake&s;t, no &s;mall piece of Policy, to keep out of their Knowledge: Their Favours are &s;o dearly bought, their Kindne&s;s &s;o uncertain, their Di&s;|plea&s;ure &s;o dangerous, and yet &s;o ea&s;ily procured. But here it is far otherwi&s;e. It is God, and God alone that is an everla&s;ting Friend, in who&s;e Pre|&s;ence there is Fulne&s;s of Joy, and Plea&s;ure for e|ver

<HEAD>II. HEAD of <HI>MOTIVES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The next Head of Motives which I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon, for the in forcing of this Duty of acquaint|ing your &s;elves with God, I &s;hall take from the glorious Effect of this Acquaintance with God. 1. The fir&s;t Effect of this Acquaintance with God is, it makes the Soul humble, and con&s;e|quently fits the Soul for greater Communications from God &s;till, and to do God the greater Ser|vice; but of that Particular afterwards. Acquain|tance with God it makes the Soul humble. When God comes into the Soul, he brings &s;uch a glori|ous Light along with him, that he makes the Soul to &s;ee, not only his Beauty, but its own De|formity, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.130. <HI>The Entrance of thy Word giveth light: it giveth &V;nder&s;tanding to the Simple.</HI> Before the Soul was acquainted with the Word of God, and by that had &s;ome Di&s;coveries of God made to it out of the Word, why it was in the dark, and &s;aw nothing at all of its own Vilene&s;s, it took no notice of that Sink, that Hell that was within it, con&s;idered not its own Trea&s;on again&s;t the Lord of Heaven and Earth, and the dange|rous Hazards that it did run, every moment up|on that account; but the Soul thought very well of its own State, it flattered it &s;elf in its own Ini|quity, the Man thinks he is rich and increa&s;ed in Goods, and hath need of nothing; but when he comes to look into his Pur&s;e, to open his Trea&s;u|ry, and to tell over all his Gold and Silver in the light, why then he perceives a &s;ad Mi&s;take: All
<PB N="184" REF="223">his Silver is Dro&s;s, and the be&s;t Riches that he hath is but Dung. When the Light comes in, he &s;ees the Darkne&s;s of his Under&s;tanding, the Per|ver&s;ene&s;s of his Will, the Di&s;orderline&s;s of his Af|fections, the Di&s;temper of the whole Soul. He before took him&s;elf for a beautiful Creature, but by this Light and this Gla&s;s he &s;ees his Beauty is great Deformity, he beholds heaps of Lu&s;ts craw|ling up and down, which before lay undi&s;cerned, and then that Man that reckoned him&s;elf &s;o happy, cries out, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall de|liver me? What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI> I am undone, undone, how &s;hall I live, where &s;hall I dwell for ever? Time was that the Man admired what the Mini&s;ters ailed to keep &s;uch a Stir about Sin, but now he wonders that they are no more earne&s;t in their preaching of it down. It was a little while ago, that he thought him&s;elf whole, but now he feels him&s;elf &s;ick to the very Heart, wounded, fainting and ready to dye; he made full account that he was pure, but now he cries out unclean, unclean; it was not long &s;ince he &s;aid with Indig|nation, Am I blind al&s;o? But now he cries out, and will not he &s;ilenced, have Mercy upon me, <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> thou Son of <HI>David,</HI> and grant that I may receive my Sight. His Language is much altered; he can now &s;ay, was ever &s;uch a Sinner as I par|doned? Will &s;uch a Prodigal ever be received? Shall &s;uch foul Offences as mine be forgiven? If God &s;hould look upon me, and give me a Chri&s;t, and pitty me, and ca&s;t his Skirts over me, while I lye in my Blood, if the Lord &s;hould look upon me, it would be &s;uch a Wonder that all that ever heard of it may ju&s;tly admire. Now the Man which thought him&s;elf the be&s;t of Saints, believes
<PB N="185" REF="224">him&s;elf as bad as the wor&s;t of Sinners! When a Man begins to be acquainted with God, he be|gins al&s;o to know him&s;elf; He that &s;aw no need of wa&s;hing by Chri&s;t, would now have Hands, Feet, Head and Heart all wa&s;h'd. He that thought him&s;elf &s;ometimes far enough from Hell, now begins to ad|mire that he did not fall into it: And although there be a &s;weet Alteration in him for the better, and Saints begin to delight very much in him, yet he wonders that any one &s;hould &s;ee any thing in him, that &s;hould cau&s;e any Affection in them towards him, much more to inflame their Hearts in &s;uch vehement Love to him; if he hear of any Reproaches that are ca&s;t upon him, he is ready to &s;ay with that wi&s;e Stoick, <HI>(Epict.) If he had known me better, he would have &s;poke much wor&s;e of me. If any prai&s;e him, he judgeth that it proceeds from their Ignorance of his Weakne&s;s, rather than from any Knowledge of his Worth; and if he hear any &s;uch Language, he is ready to tremble for fear of his own Heart, and cries out, not unto me, not unto me, but unto his Prai&s;e be given: yet not I, but Chri&s;t which dwelleth in me.</HI> Thus it is with one that begins to have &s;ome &s;aving Knowledge of God; and the nearer he comes to God, the further he goes from him&s;elf; the more he &s;ees of him and his Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, the le&s;s he &s;ees of his own; the more he is exalted, the more he deba&s;eth him&s;elf; like tho&s;e four and twenty Elders, he lays his Crown at the Feet of God. Thus it was with <HI>Job,</HI> when God, as I may &s;o &s;ay, &s;tood at a greater Di&s;tance from him, he is ready to &s;peak a little too highly he &s;tands much upon his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, he &s;tiffly ju&s;tifieth him&s;elf; but when the holy God comes a little nearer to him, when he throws off
<PB N="186" REF="225">that dark Cloud with which he had mantled him|&s;elf, and when he cau&s;ed that glorious Brightne&s;s to break forth upon <HI>Job,</HI> and made him to &s;ee a Glance of his Holine&s;s, Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice, then how is he even a&s;hamed and confounded with|in him&s;elf, that he &s;hould ever &s;tand &s;o much up|on his own Ju&s;tification, <HI>Job.</HI> 42.5, 6. <HI>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the Ear: But now mine Eye &s;eeth thee.

<PB N="199" REF="242">It is becau&s;e that poor Creatures know no better, that they doat &s;o much upon the World; did they but know what it is to have one Look of Love from God, were they but acquainted with the Glory of another World, they would &s;oon di&s;re|li&s;h every thing el&s;e; nothing will down with them which have been fea&s;ted in God's Hou&s;e, but tho&s;e royal Dainties. Ta&s;te the World who will, &s;aith the Saint, give me but more Grace, more of Chri&s;t's Company, let me but maintain an inti|mate Familiarity with God, let me be but better acquainted with him, and be more frequently re|fre&s;hed with his Smiles, this is all that I de&s;ire up|on Earth, this is all that I expect to make my Hap|pine&s;s compleat in Heaven. <HI>Whom have I in Hea|ven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I can de&s;ire in compari&s;on of thee.</HI> It was not without good Rea&s;on that the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> prizes the Commands of God above Gold and Silver: it was no Mi&s;take in <HI>Solomon</HI> to count Wi&s;dom more excellent than the fine&s;t Gold, and more precious than Rubies. That &s;piritual Merchant knew what he did when he &s;old all that he had for that Pearl of great Price; he was &s;ure he &s;hould be no Lo&s;er by &s;uch a Bargain. Bring me a heavenly Creature that hath had a View by Faith of the Glory of God's Countenance, that hath been in his Compa|ny, that hath been brought into his Banquetting-hou&s;e, &s;uch a one I am confident can ea&s;ily &s;pare that which mo&s;t keep &s;uch a fearful Stir about, he can &s;pare the World for them which are like to have no better a Portion. Give him but more of tho&s;e &s;piritual Plea&s;ures which he hath had in Communion with God, and he de&s;ires no more. He can now &s;peak it, and &s;peak it in good Ear|ne&s;t,
<PB N="200" REF="243">that there is no Compari&s;on between this World and another; he can now call this World a Shadow, and the Glory of it Gra&s;s, and write Vanity, Emptine&s;s, and Vexation upon its beau|tiful Face, and contemn all its Smiles and Frowns, and look upon its greate&s;t Lovers, as Per&s;ons that de&s;erve to be pitied rather than envied, who&s;e Portion is &s;o &s;mall, who&s;e Happine&s;s &s;o &s;hort, and who&s;e Mi&s;ery and Mi&s;take is &s;o great and di&s;mal. It is a common thing for Men to declaim again&s;t the World, and to &s;ay, it is but a little muck; it's no unu&s;ual thing for its greate&s;t Lovers to &s;peak again&s;t it, and &s;ay, that it is that which pa&s;&s;eth away; but yet for all that they pur&s;ue it more than Heaven, and are more earne&s;t for it, than the Salvation of their Souls, and more troubled at the Thought of parting with it, than at the Thought of their parting with God; and the Lo&s;s of it troubles them more than if we tell them of the Lo&s;s of their Souls: Such as the&s;e will not &s;ay but that God is infinitely more to be loved than the whole World; but yet if the World and God &s;tand in Competition, they &s;tand not long di&s;pu|ting which mu&s;t give place, the World hath the uppermo&s;t Room in the Heart. But whence is this Mi&s;take? how comes the Servant to ride, and the Ma&s;ter to go on foot? why is the World preferred before God? Why, hence it is, Men know not God, they are not acquainted with his Excellency; the World is &s;en&s;ible, he &s;ees it, he feels it, he ta&s;tes it, and &s;o he doth not the things that are invi&s;ible: and no wonder then that Sen&s;e bears the Sway; the Man wants Faith to realize Invi&s;ibles, he wants Sen&s;es &s;piritually exerci&s;ed. But now he that knows God, and is
<PB N="201" REF="244">acquainted with &s;piritual things, he hath quite another Apprehen&s;ion of the World, and that not only from Faith, but &s;ometimes from a &s;piri|tual Sen&s;e, and he can &s;ay that Divine Plea&s;ures, Riches, and Enjoyments, do as &s;en&s;ibly refre&s;h him, yea, abundantly more than ever the World did. And when he hath been newly taking a Walk in that heavenly Paradi&s;e, he looks back upon this World with Grief and Indignation, that he &s;hould ever love the World with his Heart, when there was one that did infinitely more de|&s;erve his Love, when there was a God, Chri&s;t and Holine&s;s to be loved; that he &s;hould be &s;uch a Child, &s;uch a Fool as to run after Butterflies, quar|rel for a Feather, hunt for a Shadow, while God, Chri&s;t, and Glory, tho&s;e great Sub&s;tances, lay by unregarded. Now he grudges that any thing &s;hould have his Love but his God; his deare&s;t Re|lations, if they &s;tand in God's way, mu&s;t be run over, de&s;pi&s;ed, hated. That which the Men of the World fight, and kill, and &s;pare not to damn their Souls for, he &s;ees now to be a pitiful worth|le&s;s thing, which can't defer Death a Moment, nor &s;tand him in any &s;tead in another World. He's all for that Coin which will go currant in an|other Country; and if he be but rich in Promi|&s;es, rich in &s;piritual Relations, rich in Grace, he takes him&s;elf for no unhappy Man; let the World &s;peak or think what they will of him, he doth not much pau&s;e upon it, he believes that he is but a Pilgrim and Stranger here, and if he meet with no great Kindne&s;s, it is but that which he expected. The truth of it is, he is almo&s;t afraid of the Smiles of the World, not being ignorant of this, that whom it ki&s;&s;es, it intends to betray, he can't be
<PB N="202" REF="245">over-fond of that which in all probability will keep God and him at a greater Di&s;tance, and make his Pa&s;&s;age to Glory next to impo&s;&s;ible. He reckons that it's better being rich in Grace than rich in Pur&s;e; and that he which lays up for his Body, and provides not for his Soul, is the greate&s;t Fool in the World. Tell &s;uch a one as <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI> of Riches, Honours and Preferments, he thinks them but poor &s;orry things for a Man of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to be taken with, and he will rather &s;ee them in the Dirt, than part Company with his &s;uffering Bre|thren, much le&s;s with God. It is &s;toried of <HI>A|naxagoras,</HI> that he &s;eemed to be very little con|cerned when his Country was in a Flame, upon which being taxed by &s;ome, he made this Re|ply, <HI>There is none of you all care more for your Coun|try than I do for mine;</HI> pointing with his Finger up to Heaven. Thus it is with the People of God; let others talk of Riches and Honour, but there is none of them all that value true Riches as they do; but here is the Difference, one thinks he hath Riches, when he hath the Command of a great deal of Gold and Silver, the other knows he hath Riches when he hath Chri&s;t and Grace, and can have good Returns out of that other World. And which of the&s;e are the wi&s;e&s;t will e're long be &s;een. One looks upon Heaven and Glory as a Shadow, a Fable, and the Things of this World as the only Realities; the other he looks upon Heaven, God and Eternity, as the greate&s;t Realities, and mo&s;t worthy of his highe&s;t Valuation, and the Things of this World as flying Shadows, which can't fill the Arms of him that doth embrace them: And under this Apprehen&s;ion and Sen&s;e of things, no marvel that he doth pre|fer
<PB N="203" REF="246">the Sub&s;tance before the Shadow. He believes with that Worthy, he was born for other things than to eat and drink, and &s;leep, or to take his Plea&s;ure, or to get an E&s;tate; he knows that the bu&s;ine&s;s in this. World is to provide for another, to get his Peace made with God, to contemplate Heaven, and to get thither; and therefore you mu&s;t not count it &s;trange that &s;uch a Per&s;on as this is &s;omewhat cold, and remi&s;s in his carrying on of lower De&s;igns; he knows that the di&s;pro|portion between finite and infinite, Time and Eternity, is no &s;uch incon&s;iderable one as the mo&s;t count upon. Again, he hath more than once experienced this, that the very Joys and Comforts that are to be had in the enjoying of Communion with God, even in this World, are un&s;peakably more inten&s;e and refre&s;hing than the highe&s;t &s;en|&s;ual Plea&s;ures in the World. One that is acquaint|ed with God will take the Word of his Friend for true, which Word tells him, that what&s;oever is pre&s;ented to his Sen&s;e, the World and all that is therein, mu&s;t e're long be burnt up; whereupon he thinks it no Imprudence at all to hazard pre|&s;ent Injoyment for future Hopes; no Folly to look after &s;omething that will bear the Flame. He thinks it &s;carce worth the while to be born to po&s;&s;e&s;s, if it were a whole World, except he were &s;ure of having &s;omething after it that were better than what he met with here; he had rather have one Smile from his Friend than thou&s;ands of Gold and Silver; he would not for a World be to have his Portion here, tho' it be never &s;o large a one: he had rather by far be with <HI>Lazarus</HI> upon a Dunghil, than &s;it with <HI>Dives</HI> in a Chair of State, before the riche&s;t Fare that the Sea, or Air,
<PB N="204" REF="247">or Earth could afford him: he would not change Conditions with tho&s;e that enjoy the mo&s;t of the Things of this World; he can thankfully want that which mo&s;t commonly makes its Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors mi&s;erable. O could you but talk with a Man that lives in Heaven, while he is upon Earth, and could you but &s;ee and hear how much he &s;lights that which you adore! <HI>Give me neither Poverty nor Riches, but Food convenient for me,</HI> is the highe&s;t that he dare pray for: he had rather live, in a &s;moaking Cottage, and have God for his Companion, than d well in the greate&s;t Palace, and have the Devil for his Neighbour, Coun&s;ellour, or Ma&s;ter. When a Man hath been in Heaven by Contemplation, though his Body be upon the Earth, yet the be&s;t part of him, his Affections, his Love, Joy and Heart, is &s;till there. <HI>Sen. Ep.</HI> 41. <HI>One that doth conver&s;e with God here, he is indeed that earthly Lump, his Body is below, but could you &s;ee his Thoughts, could you look into his Heart, and &s;ee the inward Actings of his Soul, you &s;hould &s;ee the Man out of the World di&s;cour&s;ing with God, he &s;ticks clo&s;e to the Company of his Friend; He is like the Sun beams, who though they touch the Earth, yet they &s;till abide there from whence they are &s;ent, and are mo&s;t inten&s;ly hot neare&s;t the Fountain, the Sun.</HI> So the Soul and Thoughts of a Child of God, they may, nay, they can't but glance upon the World; but it's mo&s;t vigorous &s;priteful Actings are towards God, and the Heat of its Affections are abundantly more re|mi&s;s and cool when they beat upon earthly Objects. He that knows what it is to have the Company of God, is almo&s;t ready to wonder how any one can be content with any thing below God; and as for him&s;elf, he takes him&s;elf for little better than a
<PB N="205" REF="248">Pri&s;oner, while his Soul is pent up in a Body which is &s;o unweildly as to all &s;piritual Employments, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill it be refined by the Grave. He would not be to dwell here for ever for a World, though he might enjoy more Content than ever any &s;ince the Fall did. A Soul acquainted with God is a noble Creature indeed, it &s;corns petty low things, it thinks no E&s;tate big enough for it, but that which is infinite; he looks upon him&s;elf as a Ci|tizen of no mean City, a Denizen of <HI>Zion,</HI> a Free|man of the <HI>New Jeru&s;alem,</HI> one of the Royal So|ciety, over which Chri&s;t, that King of Glory, is the Pre&s;ident, his Inheritance is greater than that which the Sun compa&s;&s;eth in its cour&s;e. O when (&s;aith &s;uch a one) &s;hall I leave the Cities of <HI>Cabul,</HI> and dwell with the King at <HI>Jeru&s;alem!</HI> O when &s;hall my Soul be &s;afely ark'd! O when &s;hall I be upon the Wing for Heaven! O when &s;hall I leave this Body there whence if fir&s;t came! When &s;hall I go out of this Cell, this Cage! O that I were once &s;afe in Heaven! O that I were in the imme|diate Pre&s;ence of God, and might &s;tand for ever before him, and have his ble&s;&s;ed Society for ever and ever. Neither am I now quite without him; but how little, O how little is it that I now en|joy! O when &s;hall I enter into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that better longer Life! I &s;tay and long for that &s;eparating, or rather uniting Hour, which will &s;eparate my Soul from my Body, from my Dro&s;s, but perfectly unite me to God. Look then, O my Soul, upon all that thou &s;ee&s;t below, but as &s;o many Inns and re&s;ting Places for a Pilgrim to take &s;ome little Refre&s;hment in, and then to be gone. That Day, O my fearful Soul, which thou &s;ometimes feare&s;t as my la&s;t, is the Birth|day
<PB N="206" REF="249">of Eternity. O what mean we to love our Pri&s;ons, Fetters, Burdens! What ail we to be &s;o much plea&s;ed with our Mi&s;eries, and afraid of our Happine&s;s? O this Unbelief! O were Chri&s;tians but more in the Company of God by Faith and Meditation, they would look upon God as great, and the World as a very &s;mall thing. He that knows God to be great, &s;ees eve|ry thing below him little. It is an infallible Ar|gument of a Divine and Excellent Soul, and one that hath Acquaintance with God, when he can judge all beneath God, as low, fordid, ba&s;e, and utterly unworthy of the re&s;pect of his Soul.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another glorious Effect of Acquaintance with God is, that it will ea&s;e us of all Sorrows, or cure all Sorrows. As &s;oon as any one hath but a &s;aving Knowledge of Chri&s;t, he is in &s;uch a Condition as that he need not trouble his Head with Care, nor his Heart with Fear; no more than a rich Heir that hath a tender-hearted, loving, wi&s;e Father, need not trouble him&s;elf what he &s;hall do for Bread and Cloathing; as long as the great Cau&s;e of Fear is taken away, &s;o long he is well enough. As for tho&s;e that are unacquainted with God, they either are always afraid, or have Cau&s;e al|ways to be afraid: but as for a Child of God, that Scripture buoys up his Soul under the mightie&s;t Waves of Fear, <HI>There is no Condemnation to them which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, Rom.</HI> 8.1. He that is in Covenant with God, may in this World undergo &s;ome petty Injuries, &s;ome In&s;urrections may be made again&s;t him; but this is his Comfort, he is &s;ure never to be quite over-power'd, never to be finally conquered! O the Di&s;quietments and Fears that Strangers and Enemies are compa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="207" REF="250">with, or will be! And O the Joys, the Security, the true Security that &s;ome have; at what a rate do they live! and how bravely do they die! <HI>Mark the perfect, and behold the upright Man: for the End of that Man is Peace.</HI> This was touched up|on before, when I opened the Nature and Quali|fications of this Friend, and therefore I need &s;ay the le&s;s here; yet it being the great Inquiry of the wi&s;e&s;t, how they may be &s;heltred from this Storm? What &s;hall they do to be cur'd of the&s;e Heart-qualms? how they may be freed from Fears? I &s;hall not altogether pa&s;s it over in this Place. I can't but incourage poor Strangers, as they value the true&s;t Comforts, as they would be free from Fear and Trembling when the Founda|tions of the Earth &s;hall be &s;haken, when the Mountains &s;hall tremble, and melt at the Pre|&s;ence of God, the mighty God of <HI>Jacob,</HI> when the Heavens &s;hall be rolled together as a Scroll, and be all of a Flame: Make &s;ure of this Friend; it is impo&s;&s;ible that one that hath &s;uch a one for his Friend &s;hould much be daunted, when he hears of Was and Rumours of Wars, when the Pe&s;ti|lence rages, when there are dreadful Earthquakes in &s;undry Places, and &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;s of Nations and Perplexities, that the &s;toute&s;t Heart &s;hall &s;ink that hath not this to &s;upport it: Then a Child of God may lift up his Head with Comfort, becau&s;e his Redemption draweth near. There is a va&s;t Difference between a godly Man and a wicked, as to their Affections, Fears, Joys, De&s;ires, Hopes. The godly thinks long for that which the wicked wi&s;hes with all his Heart might never be; the Day of Judgment. The righteous Man is even delighted with the fore-thoughts of that, the
<PB N="208" REF="251">Thoughts of which doth put a Damp upon all the Comforts of the ungodly; he rejoiceth in that which makes his Neighbour to tremble. As for Death, a gracious Heart that hath kept his Watch, and maintained a &s;weet and con&s;tant Corre&s;pondency with God, and hath had his Heart in Heaven, and can look upon the great <HI>Jehovah</HI> as his Friend, can't be very much affright|ed at his Approach: He is not much appaled when he looks out at the Window, and &s;ees this Me&s;&s;enger making ha&s;t to his Hou&s;e; and when he knocks at his Door, he dares let him in, and can heartily bid him welcome; he under&s;tands whence he comes and what his Errand is, and though he look &s;omewhat grimly, yet as long as he comes to conduct him to his Friend's Hou&s;e, he can di&s;pen&s;e with that; he hath more rea&s;on to &s;peak it than he which did. <HI>(Plotinus) Let me make ha&s;t away to my Country; there are my excel|lent Ance&s;tors, there dwell my noble Relations, there is the con&s;tant Re&s;idence of my deare&s;t Friends.</HI> (Tull.) <HI>O happy will that Day be when I &s;hall come into that glorious A&s;&s;embly, when I &s;hall have better Company than</HI> Homer, Orpheus, Socrates, Cato, <HI>when I &s;hall &s;it down with</HI> Abraham, I&s;aac <HI>and</HI> Jacob, <HI>in the Palace of their Friend and mine! O happy Day when I &s;hall come to my Father's Hou&s;e, to that gene|ral A&s;&s;embly, the Church, of the fir&s;t-born, to an in|numerable Company of Angels, to Je&s;us, the Media|tor of the new Covenant, and to the Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect.</HI> A Man's Knowledge of other things may add to his Fears, and make his Mi&s;e|ries greater; but the more Knowledge we have of God, the le&s;s our Fears and Sorrows mu&s;t needs be: and when our Knowledge of God is perfect,
<PB N="209" REF="252">all our Fears and Sorrows &s;hall be for ever blown over. I can't omit a brave Speech of that noble Stoick which comes to my Mind, (<HI>Ar. Epict. l.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 7.) <HI>If the Acquaintance and Favour of</HI> Cae&s;ar <HI>can keep you (as you are made to believe) from &s;ome Fears? how much rather to have God for your Father and Friend? how little Cau&s;e have &s;uch to be afraid at any time of any thing. Death it &s;elf is not evil to a Friend of God; he may &s;ay, come, let us go quickly to our Fa|ther's Hou&s;e, our Father calls us.</HI> And doth this &s;eem a &s;mall Matter to you? believe it, when you come to die you will be of another Mind then; you will think that's a Cordial worth any Money, that will rai&s;e your Spirits at &s;uch a Time, and make you with a &s;miling Countenance to pa&s;s into an everla&s;ting State. It is but a Folly to expect that any thing in the World &s;hould do this for us, but the Knowledge of our Intere&s;t with God. It's po&s;&s;ible indeed to get &s;ome &s;tupifying intoxicating Stuff, that makes a Man to die like a Bea&s;t, with|out any great Horror, the Devil's Shop will fur|ni&s;h poor dying Creatures with enough of that: Nay, he is glad if he can keep Men a&s;leep till Death awaken them; but mi&s;erable is that Man who is beholding to the Devil for his Cordials; mi&s;erable is he who hath nothing to keep him from a Hell upon Earth, but his own Ignorance and the Devil's Word. I promi&s;e you, 'tis none of the joyfule&s;t Spectacles to an inlightned Soul, to look upon one that lived wickedly, and died peaceably. You would think that a poor Man, that is going to Execution, had little Cau&s;e to &s;mile, though he &s;hould ride to the Gallows upon an ea&s;ie going Hor&s;e, or in a Coach. The Swine is u&s;ually very &s;till, when the Butcher is &s;craping away the Hair
<PB N="210" REF="253">of his Throat in order to the Sticking of him: It's no unu&s;ual thing for a vile un&s;anctified Sinner, to leap with a mad Confidence into Eternity; but he alone hath a &s;olid Peace who hath God for his Friend. This is the only Man hath ju&s;t Cau&s;e to &s;ing for Joy, when his Soul is going into ano|ther World. It was none of the wor&s;t Coun&s;el which he gave, who&s;oever he was, who &s;aid, that it doth highly concern us &s;eriou&s;ly to think of ter|rible things which we mu&s;t mo&s;t certainly &s;ee e're long, and to lay in &s;uch Provi&s;ion as may make us fit to grapple with them when they come. O for that which will keep us from crying out hereafter, What &s;hall I do? Wo is me, I am undone! Were it &s;o that there were &s;uch rare Extraction to be made which would certainly prolong our Lives as long as we would, and make us always cheerful, what Striving would there be to get &s;uch a Re|ceipt! O how would the great ones bring out their Bags to purcha&s;e it at any rate! How wil|lingly would they mortgage all their Lands, part with their riche&s;t Jewels to buy it! and yet how little will they expend for that, which if they had would prove far more effectual! O would Men and Women but under&s;tand them&s;elves, and mind their Bu&s;ine&s;s, what &s;weet Lives might they lead, what a Calm might there be con&s;tantly upon their Spirits! How cheerfully might they live! and how joyfully might they die! <HI>Tully</HI> &s;aith that he and many others had been gathering the mo&s;t pow|erful Herbs that they could find to cure all Fears, but, &s;aith he, <HI>I know not what is the matter, the di|&s;ea&s;e is &s;till &s;tronger than the Remedy.</HI> And do&s;t thou not know, O <HI>Tully,</HI> what's the matter? why, then I will tell thee, one principal Ingredient was
<PB N="211" REF="254">left out, <HI>viz.</HI> Faith in the Blood of Chri&s;t, and U|nion with God by Virtue of that Blood. He that is by Chri&s;t brought acquainted with God, need not much fear Griefs, Sorrows, and &s;uch things Chri&s;t was acquainted with for him; he hath un|&s;ting'd Death, and &s;weetned the Grave: All his Troubles are now but as Phy&s;ick, the Poy&s;on of them is corrected; though the Pill be bitter, yet it's of his Friend's Compo&s;ing, and therefore you may take it without any turning away of your Head. <HI>Shew me a Man</HI> (&s;aid old <HI>Epictetus</HI>) <HI>that is happy, truly in his Life, and happy in his Death; hap|py in his Health, and in his Sickne&s;s; happy when poor, &s;corn'd, tormented and bani&s;hed, in a word, happy in all Conditions.</HI> O that I could but talk with &s;uch a Man! O that I could &s;ee &s;uch a Spectacle! &s;uch a one as my Eyes never yet beheld. Why, I will tell thee the Rea&s;on of it, O <HI>Epictetus,</HI> It is becau&s;e thou never &s;awe&s;t a Chri&s;tian, one that was ac|quainted with God; for let me tell the World, <HI>Through Grace I have &s;een &s;uch a Sight, and do believe it to be the mo&s;t lovely Sight on this &s;ide Heaven.</HI> I have &s;een one &s;miling when his Jaws have been fal|ling, and Eye-&s;trings breaking, rejoicing, when mo&s;t about him were weeping, and accounting it a high Act of Patience to be willing to live; and how do you like &s;uch a Condition? Is it better to lie quivering, &s;haking and groaning, or rejoi|cing, and prai&s;ing, and admiring of Free-Grace, and &s;etting forth the Riches of God's Love and Goodne&s;s? Which of the&s;e would you chu&s;e? I can ea&s;ily believe that few are &s;o bad, but that they could be contented as well as <HI>Balaam</HI> to die the Death of the righteous, and to have their latter End like his? But would you die joyfully? why
<PB N="212" REF="255">then you mu&s;t live holily; get acquainted with God, and then this may be your State. I re|member <HI>Seneca</HI> &s;peaks of one <HI>Paecuvius,</HI> who when he was drunk cry'd out <GAP DESC="foreign"><HI>(I have been alive)</HI> very merrily.

Do not think therefore that I come to take away your Comforts and Joys, when I come to per&s;wade you to get Acquaintance with God, no &s;uch Matter. I would have you learn to rejoice, but yet I would that that Joy &s;hould be born from above, that the Foundation of it &s;hould be the Knowledge of your Intere&s;t in God's Love. Other Joys may make you have a &s;miling Countenance, but they do not rai&s;e and fill the Soul; for I mu&s;t tell you, I am far from thinking that every one that laughs is joyful, and without Fears. Give me a Man that knows that God is his Portion, and Heaven his Inheritance; that knows with what Friend, and in what a happy State he &s;hall live in after Death, this, this is the cheerful Man; &s;uch a one as this is can overlook momentary Sorrows, he under&s;tands full well that the Ca&s;e will be quickly alter'd with him; and the Thoughts of eternal Happine&s;s do &s;wallow up his temporal Mi&s;eries: Tell one of God's Acquaintance, of Poverty, he values it not, &s;o long as he knows he
<PB N="213" REF="256">hath a brave E&s;tate that can't be confi&s;cated, Ri|ches that none can take from him, a Trea&s;ure that Thieves can't break through to, and &s;teal. As for all worldly things, he knows that before a few Years are over he mu&s;t part with them however; he is of that Man's Mind, who having a con&s;iderable Sum of Money, and precious Jew|els hid in his Saddle, and a little odd Money in his Pocket, was &s;et upon by Thieves; who rea|dily went to his Pocket, and took what was there, and look'd no further: Now the Man &s;caping clear with his main Trea&s;ure, is &s;o joyful, that he takes no Notice of what was &s;tole from him. Thus a Child of God, if he loo&s;e his E&s;tate, his Liberty, and all his outward Injoyments, he counts all the&s;e but incon&s;iderable, as long as his Soul is &s;afe, his great Trea&s;ure is out of their Reach. Tell him of Torments, Racks, Flames, or what the Policy of Hell can invent, he is not ignorant of this, that the more he &s;uffers for Chri&s;t's Sake, the greater Cau&s;e he hath to rejoice, to be exceeding glad, for great &s;hall be his Reward in Heaven; and while they add to his Sufferings they add to his Glory: and tho' again&s;t their Will while they would injure him, they do him the greate&s;t Kindne&s;s; this light Affection works for him a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory. As long as his Torments want that dread|ful Epither, <HI>Eternal,</HI> he doth not much pau&s;e; the Thoughts of God's Love make Man's Hatred in|con&s;iderable? O how &s;weet are the Thoughts of his Friend, when his Enemies are mo&s;t bitter. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, as for tho&s;e intolerable Torments, he knows its beyond Man's Power, and far from God's Will to inflict them upon him, and &s;o long
<PB N="214" REF="257">he cares not much: All other Tortures are but a Flea-bite to the Pains of Hell, and an enraged Con&s;cience; he can almo&s;t dare the World and the Devil to do their wor&s;t, as being Confident of this, that as long as he is dear to God, his Soul is out of their Reach. Threaten him with Bani&s;hment, he remembers that he hath a Friend that will find him out, and bear him Company where&s;oever he is. Tell him of the barbarous Unkindne&s;s and Treachery of former Friends; he reads that his Betters have been wor&s;e handled by their pre|tended Friends; above all, this cheers him, to think that all his Friends will not &s;erve him &s;o, he hath one Friend that will never for&s;ake him, ne|ver be unfaithful to him. Now bring a wicked Man upon Earth, that is without his Sorrows, I know there is none, no not one; there is none of them all, but if he were within the Sight of tho&s;e devouring Flames would tremble. Tho&s;e that have Wickedne&s;s enough to dare God, will not have Courage enough to look him in the Face, when he &s;hall appear in flaming Five, to execute Vengeance upon the ungodly; he that will not now be troubled at the Doing of Wickedne&s;s, will be troubled hereafter at the Suffering for it. Let Sinners &s;ay what they will, I am &s;ure they can't be long without Fears, to behold Chri&s;t, and his dear Servants coming together in the Clouds, with Millions of mighty Angels to judge the World; I am confident it will be &s;uch an ama|zing Sight as can't choo&s;e but cool their Courage, and make the &s;toute&s;t Heart of them all to ake; I am &s;ure that as light as they make of Damnation, and God's Di&s;plea&s;ure, that the Day is coming, when they will believe it was no &s;uch Cowardi&s;e
<PB N="215" REF="258">to be afraid of an angry God, to fly from the Wrath to come, and to run away from &s;o formi|dable an Enemy as Sin. So that it's clear, that a wicked Man will fir&s;t or la&s;t be a fearful Man, a <HI>Magor mi&s;&s;abib, Fear on every Side,</HI> &s;hall be his Name. But now he that doth exceedingly fear to offend God, need not exceedingly to fear any thing el&s;e; and he that fears not God, hath cau&s;e enough to fear every thing? O Sirs, it's a brave thing to be able to take Death cheerfully by the Hand, and to walk with him joyfully into another World; and this I &s;ay again, a Man ac|quainted with God may do: he hath this to com|fort him, Death doth more properly give him Life, than take it away from him; and that as &s;oon as he is dead his Sin &s;hall die too, and his Grace live and act without Controul; then he &s;hall live a Life of Joy, a Life of perfect Holine&s;s, &s;uch a Life as Saints and Angels live, &s;uch a Life as Chri&s;t lives, the Life of God, a Life without Death, an everla&s;ting Life; and why then &s;hould he be a|fraid of Dying? As for his old Companion the Body, it is gone to re&s;t, and will e're long be awa|ken'd and ri&s;e from his Bed, more vigorous and fit for tho&s;e noble Employments which it mu&s;t be en|gaged in for ever: and Soul and Body &s;hall meet with more Comfort, than now they part with Pain, when the Body &s;hall be in another kind of Dre&s;s than now it wears, and that al&s;o &s;hall in &s;ome Re&s;pects be like the Soul, agil, holy, immortal. This is &s;uch a Man that I can call happy, and &s;o e're long will tho&s;e that now &s;corn and per&s;ecute him call him too. Ble&s;&s;ed is he that in his Life is holy, and cheerful, but mo&s;t cheerful and perfect at his Death. This is the happy Portion of God's
<PB N="216" REF="259">Acquaintance, this is the Heritage of the Friends of the Bridgroom. I have read of a wi&s;e Man, that would commend, and be thankful for every thing, becau&s;e he was &s;ure a Friend of his had the Management of every thing, who&s;e Under&s;tand|ing was infinite, and who&s;e Wi&s;dom was un|&s;earchable, who could and would work his own Honour, and his Friend's Comfort, out of every thing, yea, though &s;eemingly evil; for the great|er the Evil &s;eems to be, the greater will be the real Kindne&s;s which makes &s;o much good out of it. O but I have lately lo&s;t many of my mo&s;t near and precious Relations! If thou art one of God's Friends, let me tell thee for thy Comfort, you will meet them at your Friend's Hou&s;e, when you come thither. It was no un&s;uitable Advice that he gave no his Friend <HI>Lucilius,</HI> to cheer him up after the Lo&s;s of a dear Friend, <HI>Let us con&s;ider, my dear</HI> Lucilius, <HI>that we our &s;elves &s;hould be glad to be in that Place, and to enjoy that Company, which you are &s;o &s;ad that your Friend is gone to; and he that you &s;ay is lo&s;t, is not &s;o, but happy before you.</HI> We do not judge rightly of things. Well then, would you know what a Man is? would you pa&s;s a true E&s;timate of him, and under&s;tand his Worth and Value? Why then con&s;ider the Man without his Riches, lay a&s;ide his Honours, take away all his Externals from him; nay further, let's &s;ee the Man naked out of his Body, and how doth the Soul look? Is it now rich, beautiful, joyful? can it &s;tand confidently before God? doth it appear cheerfully in the Pre&s;ence of its Maker? Why, this is &s;omething. It matters not much whether his Body were fed with Pul&s;e or Dainties, cloathed with Rags
<PB N="217" REF="260">or Scarlet, it matters not whether his Soul went out of his Mouth, or at a Wound, whether he died in a Bed of Down, or in Flames. Methinks, by this time you &s;hould be ready to think that Religion is an excellent thing, that God's Ac|quaintance is de&s;ireable, and that no Life is like the Life of a Chri&s;tian, all who&s;e Sorrows end in Joys, who&s;e Mi&s;eries make him more happy, who&s;e Shame for Chri&s;t will make for his Glory; in a word, who&s;e Death brings him into Life. <HI>This is the Generation of them that &s;eek thee, that &s;eek thy Face,</HI> O Jacob.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another Effect of Acquaintance with God, is, That it will make us more highly to honour him. Here Familiarity is far from breeding Con|tempt. Tho&s;e that are Strangers to God &s;ee not his Worth and Excellency, they honour him not, but they have the mo&s;t vile, low, contemptible Thoughts of the infinitely glorious Maje&s;ty, and they think any thing will &s;erve his Turn, they make more bold with him than they would do with a Man like them&s;elves, they put him off with the Leavings of the World: When they have been feeding their Lu&s;ts, and &s;erving their Plea|&s;ures, and gratifying the Devil all the Day-long, then they come between &s;leep and awake, and pretend a great deal of Love to him, and Anger with them&s;elves for their Sin; whereas God knows, they do but play the Hypocrites in all they do, and mean nothing that they &s;ay: Lip-Devotion, Knee-Religion God &s;hall have, and but a little of that too; and that pitiful Stuff that they pre&s;ent him with, they think God is very much beholding to them for. As for the &s;ancti|fying the Lord God in their Hearts; as for in|ward
<PB N="218" REF="261">ward hearty Love, as for high Prizings and Ad|mirings of God, as for a real honouring of God, and wor&s;hipping of him in Spirit, and in Truth, it is that which they under&s;tand not; and as for them which do, they laugh at them, as if they were guilty of the greate&s;t Folly in the World. But now he which conver&s;eth with God, beholds &s;uch a Beauty, Excellency, Maje&s;ty, and Glory in him, that it is ready quite to &s;wallow up his Soul; he &s;peaks much of God, but yet he thinks more; he wonders that a God of &s;uch infinite Goodne&s;s &s;hould be no more loved; that a God of &s;uch infinite Greatne&s;s, Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s, &s;hould be no more feared; that a God of &s;uch un|&s;peakable Power &s;hould be no more obeyed; and while he remembers his own Contempt of God in former times, and the too mean Thoughts that he hath at pre&s;ent of him, he doth even &s;tand a|&s;toni&s;hed to think that he &s;hould be on this &s;ide the State of the Damned. He that before thought every thing too much for God, now thinks no|thing enough for him. The Man is &s;trangely changed by his new Acquaintance, &s;o that he may not improperly be called a <HI>New Man,</HI> all things are new with him. In Honour to this new Gue&s;t he hath got on new Cloaths, he is clad with Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, as with a Garment; new Food, it is his Meat and Drink to do the Will of his Father which is in Heaven; new Drink, Wine on the Lees well refined, he draws all out of tho&s;e Wells of Con&s;o|lation, the Promi&s;es: he hath new Thoughts, Words and Actions; God, Invi&s;ibles, and all the things of Faith are now Sub&s;tances with him. Now the Threats or Promi&s;es of a God are not counted &s;mall Matters; Heaven, Hell, and Eternity go for
<PB N="219" REF="262">he greate&s;t Realities, becau&s;e God &s;aith they are &s;uch. So he that &s;ometimes lived without God in the World, had no Re&s;pect at all to his Glory, but valued him&s;elf and his mo&s;t ba&s;e Lu&s;t, and the Devil him&s;elf before God, doth now re&s;pect God's Glory in all that he doth, he ventures upon no|thing deliberately, but what may plea&s;e him; Religion runs through all he doth; he eats, he drinks, and &s;leeps, and clothes him&s;elf; he prays, he works, he recreates him&s;elf with a De&s;ign for God. The grand Project he is &s;till carrying on, is the Honour of God. He will undertake nothing of Importance, before he confult with, and hath the Advice and Direction of his Friend. What|&s;oever he hath that is worth any thing, he &s;ends it to this Friend, he pre&s;ents him with his Fir&s;t Fruits, he &s;acrificeth his Male, the be&s;t of his Flock; de&s;ires that his Friend may be always at his Hou&s;e, and that he may have the be&s;t Enter|tainment that he can po&s;&s;ibly give; and he is a|&s;hamed at the be&s;t, that he can make him no more welcome, who he &s;o highly honours; he is grie|ved that his Entertainment is no better; he would fain give God his fir&s;t and la&s;t Thoughts, his warme&s;t Affections; he would gladly have the Strength and Vigour of Body and Soul &s;pent in his Service; he &s;tudies how to improve all Mer|cies and Enjoyments for God, to take hold of all Opportunities that he can po&s;&s;ible, and to make the be&s;t of them for the promoting that grand De&s;ign which he hath on Foot, his Honour. He thinks not Wife and Children, Hou&s;es and Lands, Body, Soul, and all that he can make in the World too good for him. Whatever Temptations he conquers, what&s;oever Sin he &s;lays, what&s;oever
<PB N="220" REF="263">piece of Gallantry or Prowe&s;s he hath done in his Inroads upon Satan's Kingdom, he gives the Ho|nour of all to the Valour, Conduct, and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of this his Noble Ally and Friend. He &s;ets the Grown of the King of <HI>Ammon,</HI> like <HI>Joab,</HI> upon the Head of this King <HI>David.</HI> He hath &s;uch a high E&s;teem for God, that he thinks nothing well done, but when it is done exactly as he would have it; he thinks every thing then be&s;t, when it is done according to God's Will: And he counts it no &s;mall Weakne&s;s to be unwilling that infinite Wi&s;dom rather than Folly &s;hould have the managing of all the Affairs of the World. He de&s;ires to maintain a quick and lively Sen&s;e of the Divine Maje&s;ty upon his Soul, and that he may here and hereafter give him, as he hath infinite Cau&s;e, all Honour, Glory, and Prai&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. Another Effect of this Acquaintance with God is this, it would put abundance of Life and Vigour into the Soul; it would, as it were, oyl the Wheels, and &s;et them a running. There are none in the World that act at &s;o high a rate as tho&s;e do, which are mo&s;t acquainted with God. O how undefatigable are they in their Pains! With what Earne&s;tne&s;s and Faith do they pray! As if they &s;aw the glorious God before them, and were talking with him; with what Reverence, Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Delight do they read, meditate and hear the Word, and do all that they do! They know in &s;ome mea&s;ure what it is to pre&s;ent their Bodies and Souls as a living Sacrifice to God through Chri&s;t; they under&s;tand what it means to be fervent in Spirit &s;erving the Lord; they will not &s;erve God with that which co&s;t them no|thing, kneeling down, and &s;aying a few formal
<PB N="221" REF="264">Words before God in the Evening, repeating the Lord's Prayer, and the Creed, and the Ten Commandments between &s;leeping and waking, doing no body any wrong, and the like, is not e|nough to &s;erve his Turn, his Con&s;cience will not be thus put off; but he labours with all his Might to &s;tir up his Soul to lay hold upon God, he is not content to go off from his Knees without his Father's Ble&s;&s;ing. This is the Friend and Ac|quaintace of God, this is the brave <HI>I&s;raelite,</HI> that Spiritual Prince that will not let God go till he hath prevailed with him. He doth not go to his Work, as if he cared not whether he work'd or no; he is not &s;ick of the Service of God, but he rejoyceth and works Righteou&s;ne&s;s, his Work is his Plea&s;ure, and he goes on merrily with his Bu&s;ine&s;s. Tho&s;e that are intimately acquainted with God, are not &s;o cold, faint, and dull in the Service of God, as others be. Such a one as knows God very well, and hath been oft made welcome by him, why, he comes with a great deal of Confidence, and knocks at God's Door, and, for his part, he will not go away, though the Door be not pre&s;ently opened, but he con|tinues knocking, becau&s;e he is &s;ure that his Friend is within, he knows that he is never from home, and that he can never come un&s;ea&s;onably to him. He comes to Prayer as if he were going to &s;torm Heaven, he gets Spiritual Things by Violence, he comes to Duty as to fight for a Crown, he is &s;hamed to offer the Lame and the Blind to God, but he choo&s;eth for the be&s;t in his Flock; he de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es to improve his Intere&s;t in God to the Height; his Favourite of Heaven comes frequently to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to beg &s;ome great thing or other, and he is
<PB N="222" REF="265">&s;ure that his Friend will deny him nothing, that it is not a greater Kindne&s;s to deny than give he knows that his King hath a large Pur&s;e, and as large a Heart, and he is not willing to lo&s;e &s;uch excellent things that are to be had for the asking for; he is not ignorant that &s;piritual things are worth the &s;eeking for, and therefore he will &s;eek, and &s;eek earne&s;tly; he hath tried more than once, and he remembers to his Joy, that wonderful things are to be had, if we will but take Pains for them, and prefer our Petitions, or rather get them preterr'd by that great Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and follow our Bu&s;ine&s;s clo&s;e, that it can't po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;carry let it be what it will; the Comfort in enjoying will abundantly pay all the Charges we can be at in &s;eeking; therefore he lays about him as one that is in good earne&s;t; the Confidence that he hath in the good Will of God, it puts Life into all his Petitions. A poor Greature that very rarely injoys any Communion with God, that is very little or not at all acquainted with him, is ready to take up with a few formal complemen|tal Performances, he is weary of his Work before he hath well begun it, he is quickly out of Breath; but now one that is very well acquainted with God, is not &s;o &s;oon weary of his Company; it may be, he may be &s;omewhat cold when he &s;ets out, but by that time he hath gone a few Turns with his Friend, his Blood grows warm, he is &s;ometimes &s;o taken up with God in Duty, that he can &s;carce tell when to have done? O he thinks it's good being there? O it was a &s;weet Sea&s;on! The&s;e are the Actings and Experiences of &s;ome noble Souls. I have heard &s;ome Chri&s;ti|ans
<PB N="223" REF="266">&s;ay, that had not God made it their Duty to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ollow their Callings, they could be glad with all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir Hearts to do nothing el&s;e, Day nor Night; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut hear the My&s;teries of God's Love in Chri&s;t o|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ened, read, pray, meditate, and be immediate|ly engaged in the Service of God. Sure &s;ome|thing is the matter with the&s;e Per&s;ons more than ordinary, that their Palate &s;hould be &s;o &s;piritu|alized, as that it is their Food, their Wine, their Dainties, to be actually imploy'd in the great Acts of Religion. The more any one is acquainted with God, the more Delight he takes in the Or|dinances of God; as one of God's Children, he de&s;ires the &s;incere Mik of the Word: Before he was acquainted with God, he found it far other|wi&s;e; then nothing almo&s;t would down with him, the pure Word could not be reli&s;hed, except it was adulterated with Flouri&s;hes of human Wit. He had very little Appetite to good whol&s;ome Food, his Stomach was ready to turn at it, ex|cept it were &s;o cook'd and &s;awc'd, and &s;et out, that an under&s;tanding Man could &s;carce tell what to make of it! What do you &s;ay to this, you that are &s;o faint and cold, in what you do, in the Service of God? Come a little nearer, get bet|ter acquainted with God, and you &s;hall &s;ind &s;uch Entertainment from him, that you will &s;carce he able to keep long from his Hou&s;e; get oft into his Company, and you &s;hall feel your Soul &s;trengthened with new Spirits, animated with a &s;trange Life, Heat and Warmth. You will not complain that the Sabbath is the longe&s;t Day in the Week; you will not &s;ay, <HI>What a Wearine&s;s is it? When will the New Moons and Sabbaths be at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n end?</HI> But you would think long till the Sab|bath
<PB N="224" REF="267">Day come, and when it is come, the Plea|&s;ure that you take in the Work of that Day would make you to think it the &s;horte&s;t Day, and gone too &s;oon; and when you have &s;pent it in the mo&s;t diligent Attendance upon God, you would wi&s;h it were to begin again, or that you were to begin &s;uch a Sabbath, that would never have an End. This is the Condition of one that is very intimately acquainted with God; his near|ne&s;s to his Ma&s;ter makes him to follow his Work, and he knows he &s;hall lo&s;e nothing by it; &s;ome|thing will be coming in e're and anon, which will more than quit his Co&s;t: So that when God calls, he is at hand, and readily an&s;wers, <HI>Speak, Lord, for thy Servant heareth.</HI> When God hath any Me&s;|&s;age, any hot Service to do, he accounts it his great Honour to be employed in it, and &s;aith, here I am, &s;end me. I believe he that &s;poke it (<HI>Ar. Ep. l. c.</HI> 6.) might be a little Confident, when he &s;aid, <HI>Lay what thou wilt upon me, O God, I have Power to bear it, it &s;hall not be my Burden, but my Ornament:</HI> Yet I am per&s;waded one that is ac|quainted with God, can &s;ay it, and &s;ay it again in good Earne&s;t; Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? wilt thou have me to Preach for thee, to run through Fire and Water for thee, to die for thee, to go or come? O Lord do but bare me Com|pany, and give me Strength, and it &s;hall be done: I can do all things thro' Chri&s;t that &s;trengthen|eth me. This is one of God's Champions, he watches, he keeps upon his guard, he fights &s;tout|ly, he &s;tands his Ground, in every thing he de|means him&s;elf gallantly, he quits him&s;elf like a Soldier of Chri&s;t; and that which makes him thus valiant is becau&s;e he is &s;o near his Captain. Ask
<PB N="225" REF="268"><HI>Epictetus</HI> what made <HI>Socrates</HI> do as he did, and he will tell you, (<HI>l.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 22.) <HI>It was becau&s;e he was a Friend of God, his Servant, and Partaker of his King|dom.</HI> This is &s;trange Language of a Heathen! but had he known what it was to live under the mo&s;t lively Sen&s;e of God's Love. To have had &s;uch intimate Conver&s;e with him as &s;ome Chri&s;ti|ans have had, what would he have &s;aid? As for the Saint that keeps clo&s;e to God, he keeps clo&s;e to Duty; his Work is to &s;erve, love, and prai&s;e God: this is his Bu&s;ine&s;s, both by him&s;elf, and with others.</P>
<P N="7">7. Another excellent Effect of this Acquain|tance with God, is, it will make a Man Patient under all the Di&s;pen&s;ations of God's Providence, in all Conditions to be content, in Quietne&s;s to po&s;&s;e&s;s his Spirit: Acquaintance with God will make him be at Peace, not to open his Mouth a|gain&s;t God, what&s;oever he lays upon him. What was it that kept &s;uch a Calm in <HI>Paul</HI>'s Heart, when there was &s;uch a con&s;tant Storm without him? was it not his Sen&s;e of his Intere&s;t in God's Love? though all the World were his Enemies, yet as long as Chri&s;t was his Friend he doth not care; though Men and Devils be again&s;t him, yet if God be for him, he pau&s;eth not much upon it: though Men be never &s;o unju&s;t, yet God will never be &s;o, that's his Comfort. It's a &s;mall Matter for him to be judged with Man's Judgment, as long as he is &s;ure that God will acquit him; he knows that Ju&s;tice it &s;elf will do him no Wrong, infinite Goodne&s;s could not be unkind, and that Wi&s;dom it &s;elf could work glorious Effects out of the&s;e Things, which the World call evil; if he do re|ceive Evil at the Hands of God, he is con&s;ident he
<PB N="226" REF="269">de&s;erves more; if it be good, and but a little, he is thankful, becau&s;e he de&s;erved none at all. Let the wor&s;t come to the wor&s;t, if all the Devils in Hell, and all his In&s;truments upon Earth &s;hould combine again&s;t him, as long as he is &s;ure of the Love of God, and that none of them all can pluck him out of the Arms of the Almighty, he is not very much concerned; Heaven will make amends for all; what&s;oever he &s;uffers it is nothing to the Di&s;plea&s;ure of a God, it is nothing to everla&s;ting Burnings. He believes that if his Per&s;ecutors did know what he knows, they would as &s;oon eat Fire, as do as they do; therefore he rather pities them, than is angry with them, as &s;eeing that their Day is coming. How &s;eldom have you ei|ther <HI>Paul</HI> or <HI>Silas</HI> complaining of their Sufferings! How rarely bemoaning their Condition? And what is it that makes them &s;o patient? What have they to &s;weeten &s;uch bitter Draughts? why, God loves them, and &s;o long, they do not much care though others hate them. Man's Frown can't &s;ink a Soul to Hell, nor his Favour make one happy for ever. It is but a little while, and all Tears &s;hall be wiped away from their Eyes. The Kindne&s;s and Faithfulne&s;s of God is enough to make a Man cheerfully to hold up his Head, when all the World is again&s;t him. When the mo&s;t Spiritual Chri&s;tians do complain, it is more of them&s;elves than of their Per&s;ecutors! O my unbelieving Heart! O that I &s;hould love God no more! O that my Heart &s;hould be no more taken up with the great Things of Eternity! This is the Condition which tho&s;e that are mo&s;t Spiritual are in, Poverty, Impri&s;onment, Bani&s;hment, and all tho&s;e things which mo&s;t call dreadful, when
<PB N="227" REF="270">they come to a Man that is much in Communion with God, they find him patient, meek and calm, the&s;e are not the things which put him upon the Rack; God is his Friend, and that an&s;wers all.</P>
<P N="8">8. Another glorious Effect of Acquaintance with God, is, That it will make all our Enjoy|ments doubly &s;weet. He hath what he hath in Love; he need not be afraid of Poy&s;on in any of tho&s;e Dainties which come from his deare&s;t Friend's Table; he may eat his Meat with a joy|ful Heart, and not tremble for Fear of the Reck|oning at la&s;t; what he enjoys is freely given him; all his Di&s;hes have this brave Sauce, they are &s;ea|&s;on'd with Love, and come out of the Hand of a Father. He that is the great Proprietor, hath gi|ven him Leave to u&s;e the&s;e things, and hath pro|mi&s;ed al&s;o to give him better things than the&s;e. He knows that this is not his Portion, that this is nothing to what he &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s; it is no &s;mall Comfort to him to think that he &s;hall never want any thing that is needful for him, or that if he be brought into &s;ome Exigencies, he hath a Friend that he can go to when he will, and be heartily welcome; he hath a Portion, an E&s;tate in another Country, that can never be &s;pent, though he live at never &s;o high a Rate, and the more he &s;pends upon it, the greater it is; he hath a Key to that Storehou&s;e which can never be emp|tied; he hath an Intere&s;t in him in whom all Fulne&s;s doth dwell: his Friend is noble, let him <HI>but ask and he &s;hall have, &s;eek and he &s;hall find, knock and it &s;hall be opened unto him.</HI> God is &s;o free, that he takes Care of all his Creatures; yea, &s;o great is his Royal Bounty, that it doth largely provide for his Enemies; and &s;hall his Friends, his Chil|dren
<PB N="228" REF="271">&s;tarve? Hath he not done &s;o in ancient Days? When his People were in the Wilderne&s;s he &s;ent them their Diet from his own Hou&s;e, he fed them with Angels Food. But if this &s;hould not be, if he kept them &s;hort, that may be done with as great Kindne&s;s to them as the former: fa&s;ting may fatten the Soul more than Fea&s;ting doth the Body; and this makes all welcome. If he have a great deal, he rejoiceth to think that he &s;hall have more &s;till one day; if he have but a little, he is &s;atisfied; and &s;o his Condition is made more comfortable to him, than the greate&s;t Enjoyments of the wicked are to them.</P>
<P N="9">9. Another Effect of this Acquaintance with God, is, That it will make a Man wi&s;e. He that before he was acquainted with God had not the Wit to know his Friends from his Foes, by his Conver&s;e with God is made more wi&s;e than the great Sages and grand Politicians of the World. Upon his Acquaintance with God, he is &s;oon able to know Right from Wrong, to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween Good and Evil. He hath now the Wi&s;dom to look after the Salvation of his Soul, to &s;eek the Kingdom of Heaven in the fir&s;t Place, and not to be laughed and jeered into Hell. He is &s;o wi&s;e, that he doth outwit the Devil him&s;elf; he doth get &s;o much Wi&s;dom by his Acquaintance with God, that God will reveal many of his great Se|crets to him. I know one my &s;elf that was little different from tho&s;e which are commonly called <HI>Naturals,</HI> whom when the Lord had wonderful|ly wrought upon, and brought near to him&s;elf, after his Conver&s;e and Acquaintance with God, his very natural Under&s;tanding was exceedingly refined, and afterward he became more di&s;creet and
<PB N="229" REF="272">it to manage worldly Affairs. But however this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, I am &s;ure the Knowledge of God gives Un|der&s;tanding to the &s;imple. <HI>A good &V;nder&s;tanding have they which love the Lord: and the Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wi&s;dom.</HI> Conver&s;e with Men of Wi&s;dom doth not a little improve a Man; but Conver&s;e with the wi&s;e God it makes a &s;trange Alteration indeed, they are made wi&s;e unto Sal|vation. Of &s;uch as the&s;e <HI>David</HI> thought it be&s;t to make his Privy-Council. The&s;e are the Per|&s;ons that are the fitte&s;t to advi&s;e with in Bu&s;ine&s;|&s;es of the greate&s;t Importance in the World; they have learned the Art of managing the Af|fairs of greate&s;t Concernment with the great|e&s;t Care and Prudence. I know the wi&s;e World u&s;ually look upon the&s;e Per&s;ons as the verie&s;t Fools living. To conver&s;e with God, to take all po&s;&s;ible <HI>Care to make their Calling and Election &s;ure,</HI> to do what one can to be happy for ever, goes among&s;t them for a ridiculous thing, and more than needs. But it is no great Matter, they will not be beat from their Work thus; they &s;hould be Fools indeed if &s;uch things as the&s;e &s;hould make them turn their Backs upon God; they will not be jeered out of Heaven, they pa&s;s not upon Man's Cen&s;ures. He is wi&s;e that God calls &s;o, and he will be found to be a Fool which God &s;aith is &s;o. As for the Man that is acquainted with God, all his Actions &s;peak him a Man of Prudence, one that hath a deep Reach with him, he is a Man of an excellent Fore &s;ight, he &s;ees the Clouds a gathering a great way off, the Storm before it ri|&s;ech, and he hides him&s;elf; in him are hid the Trea&s;ures of Wi&s;dom, he makes no fooli&s;h Choice, he is a Child of Wi&s;dom; he doth in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure
<PB N="230" REF="273">under&s;tand him&s;elf, and knows where his In|tere&s;t lies, and is faithful to it; he makes no fool|i&s;h Bargains, when he parts with Dung for Dia|monds, Bra&s;s for Gold, Earth for Heaven, Sin for Holine&s;s, pre&s;ent &s;hort-lived Plea&s;ures for &s;ure and everla&s;ting Delights, the Devil for God. How &s;ay you, ye mad Gallants, that look upon the Saint as a Fool, and Religion as a ridiculous thing? are the&s;e &s;uch fooli&s;h Actings? Is it &s;o undi&s;creet a Choice to prefer Heaven before Hell? If this be to be a Fool, I wi&s;h I were more &s;uch a Fool; if this be &s;o contemptible a thing, O that I may yet be more vile! Let me &s;ay further, as great a Folly as it is, there are none of you all, but e're long will wi&s;h you had been &s;uch Fools. A few Years will make you all of another Mind, when you &s;ee what tho&s;e which you counted Fools have got, and what you with your Wi&s;dom have lo&s;t; then let's hear you calling them Fools for chu&s;ing Chri&s;t for their Portion; and your &s;elf wi&s;e for de&s;pi&s;ing him, and chu&s;ing of this pre&s;ent World for your Portion. Now, it is their being acquain|ted with God, that hath made them thus wi&s;e; Time was, that they were as very Fools as any in the World, till they fell into God's Company; and ever &s;ince that, they have acted with a great deal more Prudence: their being much in God's Company hath much improved them. They may thank God for all that Skill that they have attain|ed to; for he it is that teacheth them, he is al|ways at their Elbow to direct them; when they are about to be cheated, he whi&s;pers them in the Ear, lets them under&s;tand the Fraud; and when God &s;peaks, they li&s;&s;en to his Coun&s;el. It was no Fal&s;hood which <HI>Seneca</HI> &s;pake (though he under|&s;tood
<PB N="231" REF="274">not the Meaning of this Doctrine of Recon|ciliation) in the Commendation of Wi&s;dom. <HI>Wi&s;|dom</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>is a great &s;pacious Thing, it in&s;tructs us both in Divine and Humane Things, it teacheth a Man how to demean him&s;elf in relation to things pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come: It informs him about things that are fading, and things that are la&s;ting; and by it he knows how to put a true E&s;timate and Value on both: this learns one the Difference between Time and Eter|nity.</HI> Thus far <HI>Seneca.</HI> But where is this Wi&s;dom to be found? not in <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> nor <HI>Plato</HI>'s Writings. The grand Maxims of this Wi&s;dom were little un|der&s;tood in the <HI>Peripatetick</HI> or <HI>Stoick</HI> Schools; Fle&s;h and Blood, Humane Wi&s;dom improv'd to the Height, reveal not the&s;e things to us. Where then is this Wi&s;dom to be found? and where is the Place of Under&s;tanding? Man knows not the Price of it naturally: The Depth faith, It is not in me, it can't be got for Silver, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> De&s;tru|ction and Death &s;ay, We have heard the Fame thereof with our Ears. There is talk of Wi&s;dom in Hell, there they can &s;ay what Reports were made to them of the Excellencies of Chri&s;t, and how ear|ne&s;tly they were offer'd to be in&s;tructed in the Ways of Wi&s;dom. But in Hell there is no Wi&s;|dom, though the World of them which by their wi&s;dom knew not God be there. Where then is Wi&s;dom? God under&s;tands the Way of it, and he teacheth Man Wi&s;dom, and tho&s;e that will come to him, &s;ubmit to his In&s;tructions, may learn; the Le&s;&s;on is &s;hort, yet learnt but by few: he tells Man, that to fear and love his Maker, and to be brought into Union, Friend&s;hip, and Acquaintance with God, that is Wi&s;dom; and to depart from Iniquity, that is Under&s;tanding,

<P N="10">10. Another Effect of this Acquaintance with God, is, It will make a Man rich. As &s;oon as any one is acquainted with God, he is &s;et in a thriving Way. Man at the fir&s;t had his E&s;tate in his own Hands, and he kept up his Trade for a little time, and but for a little time; for though his Stock was great, yet meeting with the Ser|pent, that great Cheater, he was mi&s;erably over|reached, and &s;o &s;adly impaired in his Spiritual E&s;tate, that he broke pre&s;ently; and had not Je|&s;us Chri&s;t &s;tep'd in and bailed him, and been his Surety, he would &s;oon have had all his Creditors upon his Back, and have been laid up in that di&s;|mal Pri&s;on, till he &s;hould have paid the utmo&s;t Farthing; but through the Kindne&s;s of Chri&s;t, the grand Creditor had Patience, and offers to make up the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and compound upon better Terms than the Sinner could po&s;&s;ibly expect. Chri&s;t undertakes to heal the infinite Breach, to bring God and Man acquainted, and to &s;et him up again, in ca&s;e he will but accept of the gracious Terms of Agreement; and thus undone Man, that was before in a beggarly Condition, upon his return to God, is &s;et in a better Way than ever; God, his Friend, now takes &s;uch order for him, that he &s;hall be &s;ure never to break again: he will be his Ca&s;h-keeper, he will have the Over-&s;ight of all, he will teach him &s;uch an Art, that he &s;hall be &s;ure to get by every thing that he trades in, he &s;hall gain by his Lo&s;&s;es, grow rich by his Poverty, and drive the be&s;t Trade, it may be, when he is for|ced to &s;hut his Shop-doors, I mean in a time of a violent Per&s;ecution. What&s;oever Lo&s;&s;es or Cro&s;&s;es come, he is &s;ure he &s;hall never be undone as long
<PB N="233" REF="276">as his Friend hath &s;o great a Bank; he hath a Key, and he can go to an infinite Trea&s;ury, when he plea&s;eth, and fetch out Supplies for any Exigen|cies or Occa&s;ions; and when all tho&s;e that made &s;uch a great Show in the World, and that were taken for Merchants, that were exceeding well to pa&s;s, &s;hall be proclaimed Bankrupts, and be found not worth a Farthing, and be carried to Pri&s;on for Debt; then he hath Mony in his Pur&s;e, Coin that will go currant in any Country. In the mean time, though he be thought to be worth nothing, to drive but a pitiful poor Trade, yet when he comes to dye, and when an exact Inven|tory is taken of all that he is worth, he is found worth thou&s;ands: And no wonder when he hath &s;uch a Partner, that will be &s;ure to &s;ee that his Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall be managed to the be&s;t Advantage; and that he &s;hall never be out of Pur&s;e upon this account, the Man can't choo&s;e but thrive; he will have &s;omething to &s;how for his Gains, when o|thers have nothing. When the rich ones of the World &s;hall be begging a Drop of Water, he is at the Fountain. If we &s;hould take a Surview of that Man's E&s;tate, that is acquainted with God, you mu&s;t lift up your Eyes to tho&s;e everla&s;ting Hills, you mu&s;t look Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North and South, all this is his, things pre&s;ent, and things to come; mount up to the Top of <HI>Carmel,</HI> your &s;ight is too &s;hort, you &s;ee not the hundredth part of his In|heritance, all this is nothing, he hath a brave E|&s;tate in another Country, he is rich in Bills and Bonds, when he comes to Age, he will have no Man knows what fall to him; and whence hath he all this Wealth; hath he not got every Penny of it &s;ince he was acquainted with God. But
<PB N="234" REF="277">I &s;hall be but brief upon this Head, becau&s;e I have handled, what might have fallen in here before; but the World laughs when I &s;peak at this rate, and think that I am much mi&s;taken; the godly Man rich! That's &s;trange! What rich with &s;carce Cloaths to their Backs, rich and fare &s;o hardly, rich and po&s;&s;e&s;s nothing! This is &s;trange Wealth. I grant it, it is &s;o, for their E&s;tate is in Invi&s;ibles; it is not he that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth much, but he that wants little is rich: Will you call nothing Riches, but Gold and Silver, and Hou&s;es and Lands? Is Vir|tue, Grace, Holine&s;s no Riches? And will you call the&s;e little, becau&s;e he hath not &s;o much Trouble and Vexation with his E&s;tate as &s;ome have? Is Heaven, Glory, the everla&s;ting Enjoy|ment of God nothing? Is the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that which is more worth than a thou&s;and Worlds, no Ri|ches; if to have all things that are good for them; if to have more than their Hearts can conceive; if to be filled with all &s;piritual Plenty, be coun|ted Poverty; let me be thus poor, rather than enjoy the Revenue of all the Princes, and great Ones of the World? And what do you think of this, you that are worth never a Penny? Are you de&s;irous to have a great E&s;tate? You that go backward, and get nothing, would be &s;et in &s;uch a way, as that you may be &s;ure never to break? Why then, get acquainted with God, and you can't but grow rich.</P>
<P N="11">11. Another glorious Effect of Acquaintance with God, is, that it makes a Man like God, which is the Top of the Creature's Honour. Com|pany is of an a&s;&s;imulating Nature. He that be|fore was unholy, and like the Devil; by Conver&s;ion to God, and Conver&s;e with him, is made holy like
<PB N="235" REF="278">God. He that before was cruel, fiery, un|merciful, by his Acquaintance with God is made kind, meek, and lovely. He that in his natural State was a Non-conformi&s;t to the Laws of his Maker, when he is well &s;tudied in this Point, is the &s;tiffe&s;t Conformi&s;t, he &s;ticks clo&s;e to the righteous Cannons of the holy God, and will not by his good Will turn to the right Hand, or to the left. He that was &s;ometimes very unlike God, when he is brought nigh unto him, his Counte|nance is changed, his Features are altered, and the Lineaments of God's Image appear very live|ly in his Face, and the more he is in God's Com|pany, and the older he grows, the more he grows like him. O how doth &s;uch a one &s;hine! What a Maje&s;ty, Glory, and Beauty is there in his Face! The oftner he comes to God, the more he is taken with his Excellency, the more he labours to in|timate him. He &s;tudies what God is, and as far as his Nature is capable of it in this Life, he de&s;ires to be like him. If God be true and faithful, he dare not be fal&s;e; but he will hate the way of ly|ing; if God be free and bountiful, he thinks it ve|ry ill becomes one of his Children to hide his Face from his own Fle&s;h, to &s;hut up his Bowels, to be void of natural Affection. If Purity be &s;o emi|nent in God, he knows that Impurity would not be commendable in him&s;elf. In a word, he de&s;ires in every thing to carry him&s;elf, as one who&s;e highe&s;t Ambition is to &s;peak, act, and think as one that would be like God. It was bravely &s;po|ken of him (<HI>Sen. Ep.</HI> 73.) e&s;pecially if we con&s;i|der what the Man was, who told his Friend that call'd him to Heaven, <HI>in compendium, To get as much Happine&s;s as this Place, this Soul, while in this
<PB N="236" REF="279">Body is capable of, that is, to get God for his Friend, to be like him.</HI> This is a &s;hort Cut to Glory, a Soul carried to Heaven, or Heaven brought down to the Soul. A full and perfect Conformity and Likene&s;s to God is the very Glory of Glory; and a partial Conformity to him upon Earth, is his un&s;peakable Honour in this Life. O were Men and Women better acquainted with God, they would &s;parkle and &s;hine in their Generation, &s;o that their Enemies &s;hould be forced to &s;ay, that a Saint is another kind of Creature than a &s;en&s;ual Sinner. O why &s;tand you then &s;o far off from God! Come nearer him, and the Rays of his glorious Image will reflect from your Lives; be acquainted with him, and you &s;hall be like him; keep much in his Company by Faith, &s;ecret Prayer and Meditation, and you will be more holy, di|vine, &s;piritual.</P>
<P N="12">12. The la&s;t Effect of this Acquaintance with God, which I &s;hall name, is this, it will make a Man better, far more excellent in all States and Relations; all his Friends will have the better Life with him, the whole Family, it may be, where he dwells will fare the better for him? If he be a Child, he is more dutiful to his Parent than he was, while he was unacquainted with God? If he be a Servant, he is more diligent and faithful than before, he &s;erves not with Eye-Service, but doth what he doth with Singlene&s;s of Heart, as unto the Lord? If he be a Ma&s;ter, it makes him more exemplary, and makes him to take care that his Hou&s;hold &s;hould &s;erve the Lord; he had rather his Servants &s;hould make bold with him than God, he is concerned for the Honour of God in his Family, as much as his own; if he be a Fa|ther,
<PB N="237" REF="280">he is careful to bring up his Children for God, he is more &s;piritual in his Affections to them, and de&s;irous to leave them God for their Father, Friend, Portion; as he is a Neighbour, he follows Peace with all Men, and Holine&s;s, becau&s;e he hath &s;een God? How &s;weet and amiable doth Acquaintance with God make a Man! How ready to heal Divi&s;ions! How full of Goodne&s;s and Cha|rity! How ready to do good unto all, but e&s;pe|cially to tho&s;e that be of the Hou&s;hold of Faith! How compa&s;&s;ionate, and tender-hearted! How ready to provoke others al&s;o to love, and good Works; &s;o that the whole Pari&s;h lives the quie|ter, all the Poor fare the better, all the Neigh|bourhood, &s;ome way or other is beholding to him; one that knows God him&s;elf, doth what he can to get others acquainted with God too? How &s;weet|ly doth he commend the way of Wi&s;dom? With what Earne&s;tne&s;s and Pity doth he plead with Sinners, and labour to teach Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors the Paths of God, that Sinners may be converted un|to him. How doth he &s;et before them the Nece&s;|&s;ity of a Change, the Danger of their pre&s;ent State, and the excellent Qualities of this Friend, that he would bring them acquainted with, tel|ling them, that time was, that he al&s;o was as they are, and thought his Condition as &s;afe as they do theirs; but that it plea&s;ed the Lord by his Word to open his Eyes, and to reveal to him the Need that he had of Chri&s;t, and to inable him to ac|cept of him, and to prize him above the whole World. In all Conditions and Relations he com|mends Religion, and &s;hews that Godline&s;s, where it is in the Power and Life of it, is a brave thing, which makes &s;o great an Alteration in a Man for
<PB N="238" REF="281">the better? If he be &s;ick, he rejoyceth, and thinks chearfully of Death, the Grave and Eternity; and in this State demeans him&s;elf &s;o, that Standers by can't but be convinced of the Reality of Invi|&s;ibles, and to think, &s;ure there is &s;omething more than ordinary in Acquaintance with God, which makes Men &s;o undaunted, and with &s;o much Gal|lantry to meet Death; &s;ure their Condition is bet|ter than ours, or el&s;e they could never be &s;o joy|ful at &s;uch a time as this is; then he tells of the U&s;e of a Chri&s;t, the Benefit of a Redeemer in a dying Hour, and how infinitely it is for ther In|tere&s;t, in time, to provide for Eternity? If he be well, he de&s;ires to improve his Health for God, and to &s;erve his Maker with the Strength of Bo|dy and Soul. If he be poor, he &s;hews a Pattern of Patience, Meekne&s;s, Thankfulne&s;s, and lets the World under&s;tand that Godline&s;s with Content is great Gain? If he be rich, he de&s;ires to be rich in good Works al&s;o, and to trade with &s;uch Tri|fles as Gold and Silver, for rich Commodities, as Grace, Peace and Glory; with the things of this World, for the things of another: To lay up for him&s;elf Trea&s;ure, which neither Moth can cor|rupt, nor Thieves break through, and &s;teal; and to make to him&s;elf a Friend of the unrighteous Mammon; to be a faithful Steward of tho&s;e Ta|lents that his great Lord and Ma&s;ter hath com|mitted to his Tru&s;t; he &s;hows how great a Good it is to be great and good too. This is the Man which doth adorn the Go&s;pel; this is the Chri|&s;tian, which doth credit his Profe&s;&s;ion; this 'tis to be intimately acquainted with God! O how u&s;eful might Men and Women be in their Generations, were they but more in God's Company? O what
<PB N="239" REF="282">a Savour would there be of their Graces in the place where they live? How would poor Creatures that receive Good by their holy Coun&s;els, and &s;uitable Lives, ble&s;s God for the Day, that ever they were born, and adore that Goodne&s;s, which brought them near &s;uch and &s;uch a one, by who&s;e Means God hath brought them out of the Va&s;&s;a|lage and Captivity of Satan, and by who&s;e Help they have got acquainted with a Friend that is more worth to them than a World; for one that hath God for his Friend, can't but de&s;ire that others al&s;o &s;hould have an Intere&s;t in him; they know how ill it will go with them that know not God, and this makes them to do what they can to bring God and Man acquainted; they would make tho&s;e that are good better, and them that are bad good? If tho&s;e that he conver&s;eth with, or &s;tands related to, were Enemies, he lets them know that a Chri&s;tian can love him dearly, who&s;e Sin he hates entirely, and that a Child of God can pity them, that have no pity at all for him. I might add how oft are a great many wicked ones &s;pared from temporal Judgments, for the &s;akes of the Righteous that are among&s;t them.</P>

<P>The next Head of <HI>Motives</HI> to enforce this Ex|hortation, might be taken from the Danger of not being acquainted with God.

Let me tell you, that except you &s;peedily humble your &s;elves, you &s;hall find that we do not make the Danger greater than it is: According to his Fear, &s;o is his Wrath; you may know &s;oon enough to your Co&s;t, what the Di&s;plea&s;ure of a God is, how dreadful his Arrows, how &s;harp his Sword. Not a Man of them &s;hall '&s;cape that will not accept of Peace upon his Terms, and that quickly too.

Well then, if you would not hereafter reflect with an aking Heart upon your lo&s;t Enjoyments, think with a &s;erious and thankful Heart of the pre&s;ent Offers, that you may in Eternity reflect with Joy upon your &s;hort Sorrows in time. If you will not be acquainted with God, you &s;hall be acquainted with the Devil, and know who&s;e Company is be&s;t by woful Experience. If you will not believe his Word, you &s;hall feel his Sword. If his Kind|ne&s;s and Goodne&s;s will not melt you, his Power and Ju&s;tice &s;hall break you; for he that now is &s;o patient, will e're long roar like a Lyon, and tear in pieces, and there &s;hall be none to deliver; he will break his &s;tubborn Enemies with a Rod of Iron, and da&s;h them in pieces like a Potter's Ve&s;|&s;el.

<PB N="251" REF="294">them to be Men of a deeper Reach, and a larger Under&s;tanding than others, becau&s;e they made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to get acquainted with God, and thus to make their Intere&s;t as large as Heaven, and their Peace and Pro&s;perity as &s;ure as the Oath of a God could make it. Do you think that all the&s;e Men were mi&s;taken? Did their Wi&s;dom lie only in a prudent Management of their worldly Affairs to their be&s;t Advantage; what then, did they mean &s;ome of them to leave all that they had &s;o chearfully upon the Command of God? dare you &s;ay that they prized the Favour of God at too high a Rate? As for their parts, they thought they could never value &s;uch a Friend as God too much. What el&s;e was the Meaning of their longing, panting, and breathing after him? Why el&s;e are they &s;o glad of his Company, his Pre&s;ence? How loth were they to do any thing that might be in the lea&s;t di&s;plea&s;ing to him? What bitter Moans did they make, if he did but withdraw a while, if he did but a little ab&s;ent him&s;elf from them? how wonderful de&s;irous were they of en|joying Communion with him? How earne&s;t to live in his Hou&s;e for ever? Dare you &s;ay that they were all Fools and Mad-men for refu&s;ing the Embraces of this pre&s;ent World, for &s;lighting its Smiles, and undervaluing its greate&s;t Kindne&s;&s;es, and choo&s;ing the Favour of God, though with the Scorns and Reproaches of the World, rather than to hazard his Anger, who&s;e Wrath burns to the Bottom of Hell. Behold what a glorious Compa|ny of the&s;e &s;tand upon Mount <HI>Zion,</HI> with Harps in their Hands, with tho&s;e hundred and fourty and four thou&s;and, and the Lamb with an innu|merable Multitude of all Nations, People, and
<PB N="252" REF="295">Languages. Why, all the&s;e were of the Friends and Acquaintance of God, or el&s;e they had never had tho&s;e Crowns, Robes, and Palms in their Hands. Now, why &s;hould not our Souls be as dear to us as theirs were to them? Will not Heaven be as good for us as them? is it not as needful for us to get a Friend of God, as them? Will not God do as much for us as them, if we will but do as they did, walk with him. The Truth of it is, the number of them which are &s;a|ved is but few, in compari&s;on of the Multitudes of them which know not God, and go the broad Way; yet for all that take them ab&s;olutely, they are abundance; &s;o many that the Scripture &s;aith they are innumerable. Do but read over the Hi|&s;tory of &s;ome of their Lives, turn over the holy Records, look &s;ometimes into tho&s;e &s;acred Chro|nicles, and behold how cheerfully they &s;erved God, how actively they followed the Lamb where&s;oever he goes, through thick and thin.

<P N="6">6. The next Head of <HI>Motives</HI> I might take from the&s;e Words, <HI>Thereby good &s;hall come unto you. Acquaint your &s;elf with him, and be at Peace, and thereby good &s;hall come unto you.</HI> But I &s;hall here be but brief. Think of what you will that is good for you, and if you are acquainted with God, you &s;hall have it for asking for; or that which is far better than that which you de&s;ire: For the Lord God is a Sun, and a Shield; he will give Grace and Glory, and no good thing will he with-hold from them which walk uprightly; that is, from tho&s;e that are acquainted with him. All his Ways are Mercy and Truth, to &s;uch as be in Covenant with him; and all &s;hall work toge|ther for good to them that love him. Enlarge thy De&s;ires as wide as the Heavens, reque&s;t what you will, ask never &s;o much and you &s;hall have it; and what would you have more? If it be the good of Profit that you de&s;ire; what greater Gain than Godline&s;s? Who can give &s;uch Re|wards to his Servants as God? Who will give greater Portions to his Children than this Father? Who is like to thrive better than he, who hath &s;uch a va&s;t Stock, &s;uch a great Trade, &s;uch quick and great Returns, and above all &s;uch a Partner? O that tho&s;e that are all for Profit and Gain, that cry out, What Advantage &s;hall it be to me, if I &s;erve God? and what Profit to me if I am ac|quainted with him? O that &s;uch would but do that which will be mo&s;t for their Profit, I would de&s;ire no more of them than this: O that they would
<PB N="259" REF="302">but try what a gainful Trade Religion in its Pow|er is! The greate&s;t Merchants that ever walked the Exchange, if they be not acquainted with God, and have not Chri&s;t for their Factor, are but Pedlars to the Saint. One that is acquainted with God, gets more in one Hour, in one Pray|er, at one Sermon, in one Meditation, than all the rich Men of the World are worth, put all their E&s;tates together: One receives his Peace, the other his Pounds; the one hath by way of return, a great deal of trouble&s;ome Lumber, the other his Box of precious Pearls, and a Jewel of an infinite Value. O little doth the laborious Worldling think what poor and &s;mall Gains his are, when he gets mo&s;t, to what this &s;piritual Merchant gets! he would not &s;ell what he gets &s;ometimes in one Morning, for all the Riches of both the <HI>Indies.</HI> He trades in &s;uch Commodities which will not &s;uffer Damage upon the Sea; his Ve&s;&s;el is light and &s;trong, the Ma&s;ter of it never made a loo&s;ing Voyage.

The World will not believe this, but I am &s;ure there is never a Man breathing, but will &s;ooner &s;ay that no Gain is like the Gain of Chri&s;t and Glory. One Re|turn from Heaven, one An&s;wer of Prayer, one Smile from God, one Look of Love, the Head of one <HI>Goliah,</HI> the Death of one Sin, one Soul brought home to Chri&s;t, one drooping Soul com|forted, is a greater Mercy (for all the ignorant

But O were Mens Eyes opened, were Men within &s;ight of tho&s;e devouring Flames, then they would believe that a Chri&s;t was worth the having, Grace a Pearl that can't be over-valued, and that no Trade was comparable to a &s;piritual Mer|chant, no Art like that by which one may turn every thing into Gold. But if it be the good of Plea&s;ure you look more after; can there be great|er Plea&s;ures than tho&s;e which are in the Pre&s;ence of God?

If the Danger of not being acquainted with God, may make you a|fraid of &s;tanding it out; if good or evil, if Peace
<PB N="261" REF="304">or War, if Life or Death, if all this be as much as nothing, what then is &s;omething? If the fre|quent pleading of Mercy, if the Blood of Chri&s;t have any Voice, if the Expo&s;tulations of his Am|ba&s;&s;adors may be heard, why &s;hould you not then be per&s;waded? If all this will not move you, what can we &s;ay more? if we could &s;hew you Heaven, and the Glories of another World, could we let you &s;ee the Face of Chri&s;t, could we any way in the world reach your Hearts, and per&s;wade you by any Means to mind the Things of eternal Peace, we would do it will all our Hearts. If we were &s;ure to get you with us, and to bring you acquainted with God, we could willingly come begging on our bare Knees to you, and be&s;eech you to be reconciled to God. We &s;ee that di&s;mal Day a coming, and are grieved to think what a &s;ad taking you will be in then; we know the Ca&s;e will then be altered with them, which will not be per&s;waded to be reconciled to God.

O to hear of &s;uch a Friend, and to have him for an Enemy; to hear of Peace, and to choo&s;e War; to hear of Heaven, and go to Hell, this is &s;ad indeed. It would have been far better for

O that they would but believe Heaven, and Hell, and Eternity, to be &s;uch Realities as &s;hortly they will! O that Mens Hearts were but affected with things, as they will be when their Souls are ju&s;t a-going, or a little after they are in another World! But O the mi|&s;erable Condition of the World! O the lamen|table State of Profe&s;&s;ors, that make no more of the Favour or Di&s;plea&s;ure of God!

Are not Men in a deep Sleep, that they do not hear? are they not blind that they do not &s;ee? are they not ignorant, fooli&s;h and mad, that they do not under&s;tand their Inte|re&s;t any better? It is not without good Rea&s;on that the Spirit of God doth &s;o oft cry out upon Sinners, for their Folly; the Scripture &s;aith not in vain, That <HI>there is none that hath &V;nder&s;tanding, no not one.</HI> No wonder that they which have but half a Cure &s;ee Men like Trees, that tho&s;e which never had a through Work do not prize Chri&s;t.

Can any Man imagine that &s;o many thou&s;ands of Prophets, Apo&s;tles and Mini&s;ters, in &s;uch di&s;tant Ages, and in &s;uch di&s;tant Places, &s;hould all agree in this, to impo&s;e a Fal&s;ity upon the World?

Is it po&s;&s;ible that Men &s;hould make &s;uch Complaint, and &s;hed &s;o many Tears, and be in &s;uch Agonies about the&s;e things, if there were nothing at all in them?

Let me, the meane&s;t of ten thou&s;and, tell the &s;tiffe&s;t Athei&s;t in the World, that I have &s;een the&s;e things &s;o realized, that I &s;hall &s;ooner believe that I am turned to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tone, or am dead, than believe that Spirituals <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e Nullities and Fancies.

I am &s;ure, if there be any Truth in the Scriptures, if the Word of God be true, if Chri&s;t and the A|po&s;tles were not all mi&s;taken, then the&s;e things are true. If I &s;hould tell you a Bu&s;ine&s;s that did concern your Hou&s;e, or your Children, or Body, or any worldly thing whatever, upon my own per|&s;onal Knowledge, would you not readily a&s;&s;ent to what I &s;ay?

<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 2. Are the&s;e things of Weight and Im|portance, or are they not? You hear that they are Matters that concern your eternal Life o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Death, Soul-Affairs; and are not the&s;e Matter of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence? If Acquaintance

You &s;aid even now, that the Word of God was true, if you will &s;tand to that, I de&s;ire no more; how is it written? Read a Ver&s;e or two, turn to <HI>Matthew</HI> 5.20. <HI>Except your Righteou&s;ne&s;s exceed the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, ye &s;hall in no ca&s;e enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</HI> And <HI>John</HI> 3.3. <HI>Except a Man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God.</HI> And God will pour his Wrath upon the Heathen, and upon the Families that call not upon his Name.

I hope you will not &s;ay, that God is mi|&s;taken, and that the Scripture &s;peaks more of the&s;e Matters than needs: What, are you gone from your Word &s;o &s;oon, did you not &s;ay that the Word of God was true, and are you now of another mind, becau&s;e you find that it requires more Strictne&s;s than you are willing to &s;ubmit to?

And do you indeed believe this? And will you &s;tand to it? Well then, my next Que&s;tion &s;hall be this: <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 3. What do you mean then to mind &s;uch things as you acknowledge to be mo&s;t un|que&s;tionably true, and of the greate&s;t Con&s;e|quence,

What &s;ay they are the greate&s;t things in the World, and will you &s;ay they are lea&s;t to be looked after? Is it a|ny Prudence and Wi&s;dom to be very &s;erious a|bout Trifles, and to trifle about the mo&s;t &s;eri|ous things? Are Heaven, the Love of God, and the like, by your own Confe&s;&s;ion the mo&s;t weigh|ty, and will you make light of them? O Folly and Hypocri&s;y! <HI>Out of thy own Mouth thou &s;halt be con|demned.</HI> Do&s;t thou know that Heaven and Hell are before you? Do&s;t thou know that the one is un&s;peakably glorious, and the other un&s;peakably dreadful? And yet for all this do&s;t thou &s;tand demurring which of the&s;e thou &s;houlde&s;t choo&s;e? and dare&s;t thou for all this venture on in a way which leads to the Region of eternal Darkne&s;s? and though tho&s;e that know the way better than you, and &s;ee you ride on &s;o ha&s;tily and merrily, call after you with Earne&s;tne&s;s, yet do&s;t thou &s;till turn thy Back upon them? Con&s;ider whether you act in the&s;e Affairs, like one that is well in his Wits. Is God the be&s;t Friend in the World, and yet his Kindne&s;s lea&s;t to be regarded? Man, what ha&s;t thou to &s;ay for thy &s;elf? O what Brutes, and how irrational are Men in their &s;piritual Matters! How do they contradict them&s;elves! How do they &s;ay one thing, and do the quite contrary! O let me in a word or two renew my Expo&s;tulation with them which are loath to be accounted Fools! What rea&s;on ha&s;t thou to undervalue the Favour of God &s;o as you do? What rea&s;on have you thus fooli&s;hly to ca&s;t away your &s;elves, and to &s;light Acquaintance with your Maker? Let me plead
<PB N="275" REF="318">with you in the Language of a Reverend Divine <HI>(R. B.)</HI> of our own. Look up your be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Rea&s;ons; and if you &s;ee a Man put his Hand into the Fire till it burn off, you'll marvel at it: But this is a thing that a Man may have rea&s;on for, as Bi&s;hop <HI>Cranmer</HI> had when he burnt off his Hand for &s;ub&s;cribing to Popery. If you &s;ee a Man cut off a Leg or an Arm, it's a &s;ad Sight; but this is a thing that a Man may have good Rea&s;on for, as many a Man doth it to &s;ave his Life. If you &s;ee a Man give his Body to be burnt to A&s;hes, and to be tormented with Strapa|do's and Racks, and refu&s;e Deliverance when it is offered: This is a hard Ca&s;e to Fle&s;h and Blood, but this a Man may have good Rea&s;on for, as you &s;ee in <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.33, 34, 35, 36. and as many hundred Martyrs have done. But for a Man to for&s;ake the Lord that made him, for a Man to run into the Fire of Hell when he is told of it, and intreated to turn that he might be &s;aved; this is a thing that can have no rea&s;on in it, that is rea&s;on indeed, to ju&s;tify or excu&s;e it. For Hea|ven will pay for the Lo&s;s of any thing that we can lo&s;e to get it, or for any Labour that we be&s;tow for it; but nothing can pay for the Lo&s;s of Hea|ven. Read on in Mr. <HI>R. B's Call to the &V;nconver|ted,</HI> Page 169. Do you &s;till believe the Word of God to be true, and the things contained in it to be the mo&s;t weighty, and yet will you &s;till pa&s;s them over, as if there were nothing at all in them? <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 4. My next Que&s;tion that I &s;hall pro|pound to you, and de&s;ire your &s;erious and &s;peedy An&s;wer to, is this, Do you believe that you can find a better Friend-than God? Can you mend your &s;elf any where el&s;e? Is there in Heaven or
<PB N="276" REF="319">Earth any that can do as much for you as God can? Is there any one that can take you off when you come to be accu&s;ed for High Trea&s;on again&s;t the King of Heaven, and to be arraigned before that ju&s;t Judge? Have you got that which will quit your Co&s;t in getting of it, and countervail the Lo&s;s of a Soul? What is it that &s;till hath an Intere&s;t in your Heart, that is thought to be an equal Competitor with God for your deare&s;t Love? If it be indeed that which will &s;hield you from the Arre&s;ts of Death, and the Wrath of the Almigh|ty; if it be that which can &s;helter you from the Storm of his Di&s;plea&s;ure; if it be that which will do you as much good as Heaven, and make you as happy as God can; why then I have little to &s;ay; make your be&s;t of it. But con&s;ider well what you do fir&s;t, be &s;ure that you be not mi&s;taken, have not many thought as you think, and have found their Mi&s;take when it was too late?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 5. Do you think that this World will la&s;t always with you? Do you not believe that e're long you mu&s;t die, and your Soul appear be|fore God, and by him be &s;entenced to its everla|&s;ting State? Where is all the Glory of tho&s;e great Monarchs which de&s;pi&s;ed God, and oppre&s;&s;ed his People? What is become of all their Pomp? Which of them that flouri&s;hed three thou&s;and Years ago &s;tand alive now in Glory? And are you better than they? Shall the Worms which have made a Prey of them, &s;pare you? Is Death more favourable now a Days, than he was before? Is not the world &s;till as it was, but Vanity? Is not all Fle&s;h &s;till but Gra&s;s, and the Beauty of it as a Flower that is cut down and withereth &s;uddenly? Well then, this being granted, that nothing is
<PB N="277" REF="320">more certain than Death, and that it is appointed for all Men once to die; would you not then be glad of &s;omething that will &s;tand you in&s;tead after Death, a Friend in another World? Why then do you not &s;peedily get acquainted with him, who a|lone can befriend you in that dreadful Hour?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 6. What do you think will become of you, if after all this you go on in your old Ways? What will become of you do you think if you &s;hould die without the Knowledge of God? What Hopes have you of Life and Peace, if you bid Defiance to the Lord of Life, and contemn the Prince of Peace? How &s;hall you e&s;cape if you neglect &s;o great Salvation? What do you think that tho&s;e which did once as you do now, &s;light Chri&s;t, and never look after Reconciliation with God, are now a doing in another World? What would you do in this Ca&s;e? Should one come to you either out of Heaven, or out of Hell, how wonderfully do you think you &s;hould be affected with the Narration which they would give you of the Affairs of the invi&s;ible World? Why then will you not now be affected with what we &s;ay? For a&s;&s;ure your &s;elves, whatever you may think, our Te&s;timony is as true, and hath a better Foundation of Credit, than if one &s;hould tell you he came from the Dead, and &s;peak to you of the&s;e things.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 7. Another Que&s;tion I would propound to you, is this; Are you willing to bear the Di&s;plea|&s;ure of God? Can you undergo the Weight of that Wrath which made his Back to ake, who was mighty to do and &s;uffer? Can you with any Pati|ence heart that dreadful Word pronounced by the Mouth of that Judge, which will &s;ee to the Execu|tion of his Sentence, <HI>Depart from me ye Cur&s;ed into
<PB N="278" REF="321">everla&s;ting Torment; Depart from me ye Workers of Iniquity, for I know you not?</HI> Can you endure with|out any Trouble that &s;calding hot Wrath, which is abundantly more painful than Fire and Brim|&s;tone, more intollerable than to be &s;hut up in a burning Fiery-Furnace, or to be boyled in a Cal|dron of melted Lead, or what&s;oever Torments the Wit of Men and Devils can invent? Can you with any Patience bear the Stone, Gout, Tooth-ach, Cholick, or &s;ome &s;uch Di&s;tempers of Body which la&s;t but for a while? O how long do you think the time when you are in that Condition? How do you to&s;s and tumble? What lamentable Moan do you make? Do not you think you can't be too much pitied in that Condition? How then will you be able to lie down in tho&s;e Torments, the lea&s;t Drop of which is abundantly more painful than the greate&s;t Torment that ever you felt in your Life? If the&s;e &s;eem dreadful to you, why do you not go the way to avoid them? Which is by get|ting an Intere&s;t in him, who hath the Keys of Hell at his Girdle; <HI>For there is no Condemnation to them which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> to them that are brought into a State of Reconciliation and Ac|quaintance with God by his Son our Mediator.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 8. Are you contented to lo&s;e everla&s;ting Happine&s;s? Can you willingly &s;ee <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and a great many from all the Quarter of the World, to &s;it down in the Kingdom of Heaven, and your &s;elves ca&s;t out? How do you like to have tho&s;e which you &s;corned to look up|on, to be &s;et at the Table at the Fea&s;t, and your &s;elf &s;hut out with the Dogs? Would you not be glad to have a Word of Comfort &s;poke to you, when your Soul is ju&s;t taking its leave of your Bo|dy?
<PB N="279" REF="322">Would you not be glad then to be conveyed by the ble&s;&s;ed Angels into the Pre&s;ence of God, and to be crowned with an immortal and glorious Crown? Would it do you any harm to be perfect in Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s when you die? Would you not be glad to be &s;aved when others &s;hall be damned? In a word, do you not de&s;ire to be re|joycing and prai&s;ing of God in endle&s;s Plea&s;ures, when others &s;hall be weeping and cur&s;ing of God in endle&s;s Torments? Why then do not you live the Lives of the Righteous, if you would die their Deaths, and have your latter End like theirs? If you would be glorious and happy for ever, why do you not endeavour to be holy and &s;piritual in time? If you would have God your Friend in ano|ther World, what do you mean that you labour no more to be acquainted with him in this World?</P>

Should
<PB N="280" REF="323">you think that &s;uch a Fellow as this did not de|&s;erve a Halter rather than your Favour? But now, if after this you &s;hould &s;end to this ungrateful Wretch, and tell him, that you are willing to for|get all that is pa&s;t, and to receive him into the greate&s;t Favour, and never to ca&s;t his former Wickedne&s;s in his Teeth; how would you take it at his Hands, if he &s;hould &s;tand I know not how long di&s;puting whether he &s;hould accept of your Kindne&s;s or no, whether he &s;hould choo&s;e the Goal and Gallows, or your Hou&s;e? but if af|ter all this you &s;hould &s;end Me&s;&s;enger after Me&s;|&s;enger, and offer to give him all that you have in the World, and to be&s;tow your only Daughter upon him, and to &s;ettle pre&s;ently a great E&s;tate upon him with her; how would you take it if this vile ungrateful Beggar &s;hould put you off a great while together with &s;ome poor Excu&s;e or other? how would you like it if he &s;hould make light of all your Offers, and tell you he thanks you for no|thing, and &s;hould undervalue your Kindne&s;s?

Thou art that Man that ha&s;t dealt thus di&s;ingenuou&s;ly with God; thou art that Beggar to whom the Lord hath &s;hewed much Kindne&s;s, and offered more; he hath &s;ent Me&s;&s;enger after Me&s;&s;enger, and at la&s;t he hath &s;ent his Son to invite thee to his own Hou&s;e, and he offers to make you as happy as Heaven, Glory and Happine&s;s it &s;elf can make you; and you &s;tand &s;till demurring, and add one Delay to another, and are far from that grateful and &s;peedy Compliance which the Nature of the thing doth require; and in&s;tead of coming at God's Call, and a thankful Owning of this mar|vellous Kindne&s;s, how ba&s;ely do&s;t thou prefer thy Company, thy Lu&s;t before him, and offer the mo&s;t intolerable Affronts to his Maje&s;ty, and make nothing of his unparallel'd Goodne&s;s, and continue&s;t in open Rebellion again&s;t him? What then ha&s;t thou to &s;ay for thy &s;elf, why God &s;hould not with a ju&s;t Abhorrency ca&s;t thee off for ever? But now that God &s;hould &s;till offer thee as high as ever, and (in&s;tead of doing as I have &s;aid, and as you your&s;elf would have done in ca&s;e of a le&s;s Contempt) &s;till follow you with &s;uch a gracious Propo&s;al as this is, that I now make unto you: is it not a Miracle of Mercy, a Prodigy of Kind|ne&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 10. And now what will you do? Will you &s;till for all this go on in your Contempt of God? Will you &s;till refu&s;e to know him, and never mind Acquaintance with him? Will you &s;till be indifferent whether you have God for your Friend, or your Enemy? Now you have been tender'd &s;uch a Match, will you make another Choice, will you be&s;tow your Heart &s;omewhere
<PB N="282" REF="325">el&s;e? And when you have done that, dare yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;tand to your Choice, and &s;ay, that you have done very wi&s;ely in refu&s;ing God, and in embracing this pre&s;ent World? Will you maintain it a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Day of Judgment, that you have done well to refu&s;e Acquaintance with him&s;elf, and to run the hazard of his Di&s;plea&s;ure? But you will not, you &s;ay, trouble your Head with &s;uch melancho|ly Fancies as the&s;e are, they are enough to put a Man be&s;ides his Wits; you hope to do as well as others, and &s;o long you care not. Well then, it &s;eems you are re&s;olved; though let me tell you, if you are contented to fare as mo&s;t &s;hall fare at la&s;t, you mu&s;t be contented to be damned; for the Scripture is exceeding clear in this, that the Number of tho&s;e that go to Heaven is a very &s;mall Number; and if you will not take my Word for it (for indeed I would not that you &s;hould take my Word, nor any Man's Breathing without Warrant from God's Word, in things of &s;o high a Nature) look into the Scripture, and at your Lei&s;ure, ponder a while upon the&s;e following Texts, <HI>Luke</HI> 13.23, 24. <HI>Then &s;aid one unto him, Lord, are there few that &s;hall be &s;aved? And he &s;aid unto them, Strive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate: for many, I &s;ay unto you, will &s;eek to enter in, and &s;hall not be able.</HI> Mat. 20.16. <HI>Many are called but few are cho&s;en.</HI> And <HI>Luke</HI> 12.32. Chri&s;t &s;aith, his Flock is a little Flock. And the Church com|plains of the Fewne&s;s of her Number in this Lan|guage; <HI>Mic.</HI> 7.1. <HI>Wo is me, for I am as when they have gather'd the Summer-Fruits.</HI> I might heap up abundance of Scriptures of the &s;ame Nature, all which &s;peak this to us, that it is not &s;o common a thing to go to Heaven, as mo&s;t People reckon
<PB N="283" REF="326">upon. But yet, if thou be re&s;olved, come what will come, not to change your Mind; if after &s;o many Warnings and Pleadings, you &s;till continue of this Judgment, I mu&s;t &s;peak a dreadful Word, Your Blood be upon your own Soul. I have blown the Trumpet, I have done what in me lies to con|vince thee of thy dangerous State, while thou art a Stranger to God, and to bring thee to a &s;peedy Acquaintance with him; but thou ha&s;t after ma|ny and many a Tender given in this An&s;wer, that as for God thou do&s;t not de&s;ire to be acquainted with him; as for your matching with his Son, it's that which thou care&s;t not for hearing of, except thou mighte&s;t have his E&s;tate without his Sove|reignty; thou wilt not have him for thy Hus|band, except he will let thee do as thou li&s;t, and run a whoring from him when thou plea&s;e&s;t. Thou wilt not have Heaven, except thou may&s;t have it without Holine&s;s; and as for the Invita|tions of God, thou &s;till make&s;t light of them, neither Promi&s;es nor Threatnings &s;ignifie much with you. Well then, when you find by woful Experience what you have done, know whom you mu&s;t lay all the blame on. I call Heaven and Earth to record, and you your &s;elves are Wit|ne&s;&s;es, that I have with all the Pity and Earne&s;tne&s;s that I could for my Soul, told you of the&s;e great things: but you think the flattering Offers that the Devil makes to be more advantagious than tho&s;e which God makes, and his Service to be pre|ferr'd before the Service of Chri&s;t, and the Friend|&s;hip of the World to be e&s;teemed before the Friend&s;hip of God; and the Plea&s;ures of Sin, which are but for a Sea&s;on, you value before tho&s;e Rivers of Plea&s;ures which are at the right Hand
<PB N="284" REF="327">of God for evermore. Now, if you continue in this Mind, blame not me if you mi&s;carry for ever; you mu&s;t whether you will or no, &s;tand to your Choice. Do not &s;ay but you were told of the&s;e things! this is not the fir&s;t time by many, but it may be the la&s;t that you may ever hear for all that I know. Remember you were once well of|fered. Do you think that God will always bare with &s;uch unworthy Abu&s;es? Shall God's Ju|&s;tice never be righted? yes, yes, be not deceiv'd, &s;lighted Kindne&s;&s;es will co&s;t dear at la&s;t. What have you yet to &s;ay for your &s;elf? Do you think that I mean you any Hurt by all this? except you count Salvation a Wrong, and Kindne&s;s it &s;elf an Injury. But if all this will not do, go then and make the be&s;t thou can&s;t of all thy Friends; let us &s;ee how well and how long they will entertain thee: e're a few Days, it may be, &s;hall be at an End, we &s;hall hear how you like your Choice: when they &s;hall turn you out of Doors, and tell you plainly, they can do nothing for you, you mu&s;t &s;hift as well as you can; as for them, they can't provide for them&s;elves, much le&s;s for you. And then let's &s;ee who hath made the be&s;t Choice, he that is acquainted with God, and cho&s;en him for his Friend, or he that hath taken the World for his Friend? Let's &s;ee who will do mo&s;t for their Friends, when a Time of Trial comes. When Heaven and Earth are all in a Flame, when the Trumpet is &s;ounding, when the Judge and his Attendants, Chri&s;t and all his holy Angels, are coming, when the Pri&s;ons, the Graves, are o|pened, and the Pri&s;oners are brought forth, then let's &s;ee who will have the cheerfulle&s;t Counte|nance, he that holdeth up his hand at the Bar, or
<PB N="285" REF="328">they that &s;it upon the Bench with the Judge; for know you not that the Saints, the Friends of the Judge, &s;hall &s;it with him when he judgeth the World? We &s;hall know when the Storm ri&s;eth who&s;e Hou&s;e was be&s;t, that which was built upon the Sand, or that which was built upon the Rock. O that People were now of the &s;ame Mind that they will be of at the Day of Judgment! O that they would con&s;ider, that if they will not now be at lei&s;ure to think of the&s;e things, they &s;hall be at lei&s;ure to repent of them hereafter. Do not talk of Scorns and Reproaches, and Suffe|ring, what do you think that Heaven will not make Amends for all that? Which is mo&s;t to be feared, the Scorns of God, or the Scorns of Men? Which will do you mo&s;t Hurt, Man's Contempt or God's? Where is the Man that will be laughed out of a great E&s;tate? becau&s;e a Fool &s;aith, that a Jewel is not worth the taking up, will you therefore never &s;toop to take it up? The Truth of it is, if you intend to make any thing of your Profe&s;&s;ion, you mu&s;t be willing to be counted a Fool, and a Mad-man: but you mu&s;t remember, it is by tho&s;e that are &s;o them|&s;elves. O be not affrighted from your Duty by the Talk of the Rabble. If the thing be evil, let the Vice of it &s;care you; but if it be good, let not the Fear of them which are very incompetent Judges in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, divert you from it. Do you think that &s;uch poor Excu&s;es will be taken at the Day of Judgment? what do you intend to &s;ay to God then? Lord, I would have laboured to have known thee, I would have taken &s;ome Care of my Soul, and I would have taken &s;ome Pains a|bout the Things of Eternity, but that I &s;aw that

<P>If you would be acquainted with God, labour to get a through Sen&s;e of your great E&s;trange|ment from him, and of the Danger of &s;uch an E|&s;trangement. This is that which makes People <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o well contented with their Condition, becau&s;e they &s;ee no great Evil nor Danger in it. Men are ready to think very well of their Condition, al|though they be Enemies to God, and no Friends to Chri&s;t. Enemies to God, they &s;corn your Words, though all this while they expre&s;s the greate&s;t Contempt of him conceivable; though they re|gard neither his Commands, Threatnings nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">romi&s;es, though they value the Company of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">runkard, a Whore, before the Company of God; though they do all that they can again&s;t God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve nothing that he loves, though they fide with God's greate&s;t Enemies, yet they abhor to be|thought
<PB N="288" REF="331">thought to be any other than Well-wi&s;hers to Chri&s;t, and the Friends and Servants of God; though they never come near God, yet they take it very ill, if they be not reckon'd among&s;t his Acquaintance and &s;pecial Friends. Where is the Profe&s;&s;or almo&s;t living, that doth not count it a high Piece of Uncharitablene&s;s, if one do not ca|nonize them among the Saints, though they live more like Brutes! How hainou&s;ly do they take it, if any one do but que&s;tion their State? They, ignorant of God! They, Enemies to the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t! They, blind! They, unconverted! Who is that Man which dare que&s;tion their Con|dition? They hope to fare as well as any preci&s;e Puritan of them all; they will hope to be &s;aved, &s;ay what you will then, you &s;hall never beat them out of their Tru&s;t in God. And though in Faith|fulne&s;s to their Souls, we beg of them to make a more diligent Enquiry into the State of their Souls, becau&s;e we know that the Heart is &s;o deceitful, and we have very great cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect that they know not God; yet they will go on very cheerfully with this Confidence, until Chri&s;t him&s;elf &s;hew them their Mi&s;take, and tell them plainly that he knows them not, and that he ne|ver accounted them any of his Friends. But now did Men but throughly under&s;tand their natural E&s;trangement from God, were they but indeed &s;en&s;ible of the Vilene&s;s of their Hearts, did they but take Notice of the Rebellions and Trea&s;ons that are within, the Ca&s;e would be far otherwi&s;e with them than it is. O this, this is the rea&s;on why &s;o many millions of Profe&s;&s;ors mi&s;carry ever|la&s;tingly, and never come to de&s;ire the Friend|&s;hip of God, becau&s;e they never believed that
<PB N="289" REF="332"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey were any otherwi&s;e than Friends; they do not &s;u&s;pect them&s;elves at all, but think that they are rich and increa&s;e in Goods, and have need of nothing, whereas the Lord knows, and Chri&s;tians know too, that they are poor and blind, and na|ked. But now when Men begin to be thorowly &s;en&s;ible of this Enmity that is in their Natures again&s;t God; when they &s;ee what Mutinies and Rebellions there are in them again&s;t their mo&s;t gracious Lord and King; and when they are made to under&s;tand the Con&s;equences of this War, then how &s;en&s;ibly do they cry out, what &s;hall they do? was there ever any poor wretched Creatures in a wor&s;e Condition than them&s;elves? was ever any ones Heart wor&s;e than theirs? are there any out of Hell that are &s;uch Mon&s;ters of Sin as they are? O what &s;hall they do? they &s;ee the Fire kindled, and them&s;elves hanging over everla&s;ting Burn|ings: now all the World for a Chri&s;t; they be|lieve now that God and Man are not Equals; that there is no contending with the Almighty; who can &s;tand before his Indignation? and when they &s;ee God's Sword drawn, and the Point of it &s;et a|gain&s;t their Heart, when they behold the Terrors of the Lord &s;etting them&s;elves in Array again&s;t them, and them&s;elves like to lo&s;e all, then how welcome would the News of a Parly be? how glad would they be then to hear of a Pardon? then down go their Weapons; they will &s;ooner come before God with a Halter about their Necks, than a Sword by their Sides; they will fight now with no other Weapons but Tears and Prayers: as for their Armour they brake it pieces, and lay it at the Feet of their offended Prince; and O if they might but have any Hopes of Pardon, it would
<PB N="290" REF="333">revive their Hearts; if they might have but a Look of Kindne&s;s from God, it would be a greater Comfort to them than all the whole World be|&s;ides could afford them. To whom can a skilful Phy&s;ician be more welcome than to the &s;ick? Chri&s;t came to &s;eek the lo&s;t, and &s;uch as the&s;e we are &s;ent to incourage: but till the Soul comes to this pa&s;s, a Chri&s;t is not valued at all by it: if Sinners be not made thus to under&s;tand them|&s;elves, why, though we &s;hould plead with never &s;o much Earne&s;tne&s;s with them, we do but beat the Air, all that we can &s;ay &s;ignifies very little. The Man thinks his great Work is done, though his Hands have been all this while in his Bo&s;om; he is far onwards in his Journey to Heaven, tho' he never &s;et one Step out of his own Doors; he hath an Intere&s;t in God, and is very well acquain|ted with him, and hath an a&s;&s;ured Con&s;idence of his Condition, that he &s;hall be happy, though he have not one Dram of Grace. He is a good Churchman, he hath &s;ate at the Lord's Table, and the like: But O how many are there which &s;hall &s;ee and know that it is more than po&s;&s;ible, to come oft before God, and to complement him much, and to &s;it oft at his Table, and yet not to be any of his peculiar Friends, and &s;pecial Ac|quaintance; now if ever you would make any thing of Religion, and be made highly to prize God's Favour, and to be really acquainted with him; you mu&s;t labour to under&s;tand your Di&s;tance from him, and the unconceivable Hazard that you run, while you are in a State of Separation from God; that there is but one Step between you and the State of the Damned; for what would become of you, if God
<PB N="291" REF="334">&s;hould &s;ay to you, this Night thy Sould &s;hall be re|quired of you. How ea&s;ily can God in a Moment &s;top your Breath, and &s;end your Soul and Body into that Lake which burns for ever and ever? and is it not then time for you to look about you? O this Ignorance of our &s;elves, how doth it expo&s;e us? (<HI>Ar. Epict. l.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 26.) He was not a whit mi&s;taken, who &s;aid, <HI>That the not knowing of our &s;elves, was one of the chiefe&s;t Cau&s;es of our Sin and Mi&s;ery, and that the Con&s;ideration of the State of the Soul, and the thorow &V;nder&s;tanding its Depravedne&s;s, was the Beginning of Wi&s;dom; for its Weakne&s;s being well known, a Man will not afterwards tru&s;t it in the Determination of the greate&s;t things; but Man will be de&s;irous to con&s;ult that great Oracle, the Will of his Maker; and finding his old Guide is blind, and hath oft mi&s;led him, thereupon he is the readier to be ac|quainted with &s;uch a one, who may direct him in the Way to true Happine&s;s.</HI> If you would therefore be acquainted with God, you mu&s;t get well acquain|ted with your &s;elves; you will upon the Know|ledge of your &s;elf, be afraid of your &s;elf. He was none of the weake&s;t Men who &s;aid, <HI>That a true &s;en&s;e of Folly is no &s;mall Sign of &s;ome Proficiency in Wi&s;dom.</HI> Look into thy &s;elf, O Man, &s;earch every corner, behold what abundance of Armour there is in &s;uch and &s;uch a dark Cellar; but is this Ar|mour &s;trong enough to incounter a God withal? Can&s;t thou with the&s;e Fig-leaves defend thy &s;elf again&s;t the Arrows of the Almighty? behold what a Condition thou art in, if thou &s;tirre&s;t a Step further. Yield &s;peedily, and throw down thine Arms, or you are a dead Man. Do you know this? Do you really believe this? Is it po&s;&s;ible? What do you believe that your Trea|&s;on
<PB N="292" REF="335">is found out, and that you are within a little of Execution, and yet not tremble, and yet not &s;eek nor de&s;ire a Pardon. When a Man through|ly under&s;tands how things &s;tand between him and God, and how unable he is to carry on a War a|gain&s;t him, he will &s;peedily ca&s;t about, how he may conclude a Peace upon any Terms. As &s;oon as <HI>Benhadad</HI> knew what a Condition his Army was in, when he &s;aw the Crowns of his thirty Kings &s;haken, and his Warlike Captains cut in Pieces, or to tremble, and be like Women; when in&s;tead of a mighty Army of gallant Warriours in martial Order, behaving them&s;elves bravely in the Field, he &s;aw their Carka&s;es upon Heaps, their Garments rolled in Blood, the Shields of his mighty Ones ca&s;t away, and him&s;elf wofully de|&s;erted, how &s;peedily doth he &s;end away his Ser|vants, with Ropes about their Necks, to beg Peace upon any Terms? When the <HI>Gibeonites</HI> heard what dangerous Fighting it was again&s;t <HI>Jo|&s;huah,</HI> they were not long before they found Means to make a Covenant with him. So the Soul, when it doth &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider what a &s;ad Condition it is in, while it continues in Rebellion again&s;t God; it's Impo&s;&s;ibility to &s;tand it out long, and utter Inability to conquer him: when it perceives the De&s;igns of Satan, who fir&s;t cau&s;ed this Difference between the Soul and God, and hath &s;till in&s;tigated and &s;tirred it up to per&s;ecute with all the Violence that might be; I &s;ay, when the Soul &s;ees this before it be quite too late, O how doth it bewail its Condition, how doth it cry out, O wretched Man that I am who &s;hall deliver me? O what will become of me, if I make War &s;till again&s;t God? And as for flying, whether
<PB N="293" REF="336">&s;hall I fly from his Pre&s;ence, and where &s;hall I hide my &s;elf out of his Sight? And how &s;hall I look him in the Face, whom I have thus de&s;perately and ungratefully oppo&s;ed? Can &s;uch a Traytor as I po&s;&s;ibly expect any Mercy; if the Lord &s;hould look upon me, and not immediately ca&s;t me into Hell, it would be a Miracle of Patience. And thus the Man that begins a little to under&s;tand him&s;elf, &s;peaks to him&s;elf; and after that, he with <HI>Ephraim,</HI> &s;mites upon his Thigh, and be|moans his Condition exceedingly! O that he &s;hould ever take up Arms again&s;t his gracious Prince? O what &s;hall become of him? Well, I have heard that the God of Heaven is a merci|ful King, I will go and ca&s;t my &s;elf at his Feet, if I peri&s;h, I peri&s;h. If I continue in this Rebel|lion, there is no Hopes, if I fly there is no e&s;ca|ping! and if I yield, I can but peri&s;h! O &s;ad, &s;ad is my Condition, wo and alas, what &s;hall I do in the&s;e dreadful Perplexities: But why do I &s;tay here? the Avenger of Blood follows after me a|pace; well, I will go to my God, through Chri&s;t, and I have heard that this is the only Way, and that there is not the lea&s;t Hope in the World, a|ny other Way, to get a Pardon, to e&s;cape the Wrath to come! O that the precious and mer|ciful Je&s;us would pity me, and &s;tand my Friend now if ever! O that he would &s;peak a good Word for me, <HI>Have Mercy upon me,</HI> Je&s;us <HI>thou Son of</HI> David <HI>have Mercy upon me!</HI> O make Peace for me, by thy Blood; if thou wilt, thou can&s;t do more with a Words &s;peaking, than all the Saints and Angels in the World; if ever any poor Creature in the World had need of Mercy, then have I. O Mercy, Mercy, Mercy for thy Blood's
<PB N="294" REF="337">&s;ake! But becau&s;e I &s;hall &s;peak to this under ano|ther Direction, I &s;hall be the briefer. Now when a Man is at this pa&s;s, he is in a fair Way for Peace; but now as long as a Man is ignorant of all this, he is quite in another Note, he will never buckle, and therefore he &s;hall be broken. Therefore con|&s;ider well your Condition; ob&s;erve the Actings of your own Soul; if you be one of the Friends and Acquaintance of God, what means your breaking and hating of his &s;piritual Laws? what's the Rea&s;on, if you love God, that you can take no Delight at all in his Company, no Plea&s;ure in his Sabbaths? if you are a Friend of God, how hap you come no oftner to his Hou&s;e, when he dwells &s;o near you? Why do you knock no oftner at his Door? why are you &s;o rare in your Vi&s;its? is this your Kindne&s;s? is this like a Friend? How comes it to pa&s;s that there are &s;o many Arms found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id in your Hou&s;e? what are they all for? what is the Meaning of all tho&s;e Meetings that you give to God's Enemies! what do all tho&s;e Whi&s;|perings, Plots, and Projects &s;ignifie? is this Friend&s;hip? can you mean any good by all this? What do you &s;ay of your Condition? do you ever complain, and that feelingly, of your Enmi|ty again&s;t God? did you ever ob&s;erve what a de&s;|perate wicked Spirit you have again&s;t your Maker; and were you ever made &s;en&s;ible of the Danger of &s;uch a State, and a&s;hamed and grieved to the ve|ry Soul that you &s;hould ever engage again&s;t &s;o good a God? Why then I am confident you can't but cry out with all the Strength and Earne&s;tne&s;s of your Soul for a Peace, you can't but de&s;ire to meet with your Adver&s;ary quickly, while he is in the Way. But if you &s;ee nothing at all of the
<PB N="295" REF="338">Treachery and Ba&s;ene&s;s that is in your Heart, &s;earch, and &s;earch again, it's your ignorance and Blindne&s;s, and not the Goodne&s;s of your State, that makes you to know nothing by your &s;elf. What, are you better than <HI>David?</HI> he was &s;o jea|lous of his own Heart, that he dar'd not to tru&s;t to his own Examination of it, but he de&s;ires the great Heart-&s;earcher to help him in this Work.

<HEAD>II. DIRECTION.</HEAD>
<P>My next <HI>Direction</HI> to tho&s;e which would be ac|quainted with God, &s;hall be this: Get an hum|ble Heart, which is the con&s;equent of the former. God will exalt none to this high Honour of being
<PB N="296" REF="339">his Friends, but &s;uch as have low Thoughts of them&s;elves. The humble are the Per&s;ons that he will rai&s;e, the&s;e are they that he will conver&s;e mo&s;t with, the&s;e are the great Favourites of Hea|ven which God doth delight to honour, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 34.18. <HI>The Lord is nigh to them which are of a broken Heart, and &s;aveth &s;uch as be of a contrite Spirit.</HI> God is nigh to them, (with Reverence be it &s;po|ken) God takes &s;o much Complacency in the Com|pany of &s;uch, that he can't endure to have them far from him, he mu&s;t have them always nigh to him, always under his Eye; as for the&s;e broken ones, he will to be &s;ure not leave them long, not go far from them, but will be ready at Hand to &s;et their Bones, to bind up their Wounds, to keep them from fe&s;tering. It may be he may put them to much Pain before he brings the Cure to Perfe|ction, but it is to prevent future Aches. He is a fooli&s;h cruel Chyrurgeon, who for fear of putting his Patient to &s;ome Pain, never &s;earcheth the Wound, but skins it over pre&s;ently: and a wi&s;e Man will not think him unmerciful that puts him to exqui&s;ite Pain, &s;o he make a thorough Cure of it. Thus God doth by his Patients &s;ometimes, when the Nature of their Di&s;temper calls for it. But however, he will be &s;ure not to be out of the Way when they want him mo&s;t. It's po&s;&s;ible they may look upon them&s;elves as forgotten by God, they may not know their Phy&s;ician when he is by them, and they may take their Friend for an Enemy, they may think God far off when he is near; but when their Eyes are opened, and their Di&s;temper is pretty well worn off, they will with Shame and Thankfulne&s;s acknowledge their Error; nay, they do from their Souls confe&s;s that
<PB N="297" REF="340">they do not de&s;erve the lea&s;t Look of Kindne&s;s from God, but to be counted Strangers and Ene|mies; but God will let them know that he loves to act like him&s;elf, that is like a God of Love, Mercy and Goodne&s;s; and that they are the Per|&s;ons that he hath &s;et his Heart upon; he will have them in his Bo&s;om, never leave them nor for&s;ake them; and though the&s;e contrite ones ma|ny times look upon them&s;elves as lo&s;t, yet God will &s;ave them, and they &s;hall &s;ing a Song of Thankfulne&s;s among&s;t his deliver'd ones. Again, the Sacrifices of God are a broken Heart: <HI>A bro|ken and a contrite Spirit, O God, thou wilt not de&s;pi&s;e,</HI> P&s;al. 51.17. The proud Sinner he may bring his &s;talled Oxen, Multitudes of Rams and Sheep, and his Rivers of Oyl, and yet all this while not he accepted. There is another kind of Sacrifice that would be ten thou&s;and times more accepta|ble to God. We read that Sacrifices have been de&s;pi&s;ed, Prayers, long Prayers, have been re|jected; Sabbaths, New Moons, and &s;olemn A&s;|&s;emblies, the Lord hath &s;ometimes abhorr'd; but we never read that he de&s;pi&s;ed the Sacrifice of an humble Heart, the Prayers of &s;uch always have an An&s;wer one Way or other; their poor Performances, their Chatterings, and Mourn|ings, are &s;weet Melody, and powerful Rheto|rick in God's Ear. Who are the Men that have mo&s;t of God's Company? who are they which he doth mo&s;t frequently vi&s;it, are they not &s;uch as look upon them&s;elves as the chiefe&s;t of Sinners? The&s;e are they which are wrapped up into the third Heaven. None have &s;o much of Heaven upon Earth as tho&s;e that wonder that the Earth doth not &s;wallow them up, and that they are
<PB N="298" REF="341">not in Hell. But O, &s;aith the humble Soul, God is the high and mighty God, and infinite in his Holine&s;s and Ju&s;tice; how then can &s;uch a Creature as I ever expect that he &s;hould &s;o much as ca&s;t his Eye upon me? yes, &s;weet Soul, &s;uch is the infinite Conde&s;cention and Goodne&s;s of God&punc; that he will &s;ooner look upon thee than another&punc; And if you can't credit my Words, hear what he &s;peaks him&s;elf, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 7.15. <HI>Thus &s;aith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth Eternity, who&s;e Name is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy Place, with him al&s;o that is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to re|vive the Spirit of the humble, and to revive the Heart of my contrite ones.</HI> The Thoughts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God's Maje&s;ty, Eternity, and Holine&s;s may, and with good Rea&s;on too, awe that Soul that hath low Thoughts of it &s;elf. Every Sinner hath Cau&s;e enough to cry out with A&s;toni&s;hment, Will God look upon &s;uch a vile &s;inful Wretch as I am Will he that is infinite in Holine&s;s take any No|tice of me, except to &s;hew his Di&s;plea&s;ure a|gain&s;t me? What &s;hall I do? &s;ure &s;uch a Crea|ture as I can't without a Miracle have a Smile from God. God may indeed look upon me in his Wrath, and vex me in his &s;ore Di&s;plea&s;ure. God may ju&s;tly look me into Hell; but that he &s;hould look upon me in Kindne&s;s, or take any &s;pecial Notice of me in Love, that would be a Wonder indeed. What, God dwell with me! Yes, with thee, if thou ha&s;t but high Thoughts of him, and low Thoughts of thy &s;elf; the meaner thou thinke&s;t of thy &s;elf, the greater Worth he &s;ees in thee. God will not only look upon thee, nor will he only knock at thy Door, and call at your Hou&s;e, or give you a tran&s;itory Vi&s;it, but he
<PB N="299" REF="342">will come and dwell with thee. Now dwelling &s;peaks a continued Abode with one, and thus God will continue with the Humble; never remove from them, for any con&s;iderable time, till Eter|nity hath an end, till him&s;elf, and the Soul cea&s;e to be, which will be never. God will not be a Stranger to humble Souls, but he will come to them, and bring that along with him, that &s;hall make him and them welcome too. God never comes to his Friends, but he brings good cheer along with him. When the Soul gives God the be&s;t Entertainment, it is all at his Co&s;t, his Bread, his Fatlings, his Wine, his Oyl, his Cordials, his rich Dainties. Where God comes, he will keep a noble Hou&s;e, and there &s;hall be Mirth and rich Cheer, good Store, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 66.1, 2. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, Heaven is my Throne, and Earth is my Foot|&s;tool: Where is that Hou&s;e ye will build me? And where is the Place of my Re&s;t? For all the&s;e things hath my Hand made, and all tho&s;e things hath been, &s;aith the Lord; but to this Man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite Spirit, and trembleth at my Word.</HI> God &s;eems to have low Thoughts of Heaven it &s;elf in compari&s;on of an humble Soul: This is the Palace, where this great King will keep his Court; this is the Place of his Re&s;t. God is not &s;o much delighted and plea&s;ed in any of his brave Seats, as in this of an humble Heart; here he dwelleth mo&s;t commonly; this was the great Purcha&s;e of his own Son; this was the Ma|&s;ter-piece of his Power and Goodne&s;s; this was the Project of infinite Wi&s;dom and Coun&s;el. <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI> Is a Language that makes Hell in a Rage, and Heaven to rejoice. God is never &s;o well plea&s;ed as when he beholds the
<PB N="300" REF="343">Beauty of his own Grace &s;hining in a poor lo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;elf deba&s;ing Creature. The Spou&s;e is adorned with Humility, when Chri&s;t gives her that Vi&s;it <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.4. God hath far more Kindne&s;s for one that lyes under a Sen&s;e of his own Vilene&s;s, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thinks him&s;elf unworthy to tread upon God's Earth, or to breath in his Air, than for the mo&s;t confident righteous Phari&s;ee in the World. Such an humble Soul will be much in admiring of God, and will &s;et a high Price upon his Kindne&s;s; a Look, a Smile, a Vi&s;it! O how welcome are they to tho&s;e poor trembling ones! Wherefore God doth with Frequency and Love vi&s;it them; he knows that he can never be unwelcome to &s;uch, they will count it the highe&s;t Honour, that the mo&s;t High &s;hould come into them in their low Condition. Wherefore if you de&s;ire to have any intimate Acquaintance with God, labour to be more and more &s;en&s;ible of your own Unworthi|ne&s;s, &s;tudy your Heart and Nature well, and be more curious in the Ob&s;ervance of the Ba&s;ene&s;s and Treachery of your own Soul; endeavour to have as mean Thoughts of your &s;elf as <HI>Paul</HI> had, who did not &s;tick to call him&s;elf the chiefe&s;t of Sin|ners: Humble your &s;elves before the Lord, and he will exalt you; he that is little in his own Eye, is great in God's. When was it that <HI>Jacob</HI> met with God, but when he had been humbling of him&s;elf? As you may read at your lei&s;ure, <HI>Gen.</HI> 23. There is many a Profe&s;&s;or that holds out ma|ny a Year in a Cour&s;e of external Performances, and yet never knows what it is to have any inti|mate Acquaintance or Conver&s;e with God: Whereas I am per&s;waded, if the Bu&s;ine&s;s were throughly examined, it would be found that

The more any one grows in Grace, and Acquaintance with God, the more he &s;ees of his own Unworthine&s;s, the more he admires Free Grace. Why me, Lord! Why me! Will be the Language of tho&s;e which conver&s;e with God: And while they are thus admiring God, and lay|ing them&s;elves low, he comes again with his Soul ravi&s;hing Kindne&s;&s;es; and thus by Humility they are more acquainted with God, and being more acquainted with God, they are made more hum|ble, and the one encrea&s;eth the other. Thus the humble Soul is rai&s;ed higher and higher, till he come to an eternal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of God in the high|e&s;t Heavens. When an humble Saint lives as it were in Heaven upon Earth, he &s;carce thinks him&s;elf worthy to live upon the Earth. When a|ny one &s;peaks well of him, and admireth the Grace

Awake, awake P&s;altery and Harp, I my &s;elf will awake and prai&s;e, admire and love thee, O my God, who&s;e Love to my Soul is beyond Expre&s;&s;ion. And thus while the Soul is mu&s;ing, the Fire begins to burn; while the Spou&s;e is thinking of her glorious Husband, he knocks at the Door, &s;he draws the Latch, and he comes in &s;melling of Mirrhe, Aloes and Ca&s;&s;ia; he comes and ki&s;&s;es the Soul with the Ki&s;&s;es of his Lips, his Love is better than Wine, he comes and takes the Soul into his Arms. O the &s;weet Plea&s;ure of Di|vine
<PB N="307" REF="350">Love, infinitely tran&s;cending all carnal Af|fections! O the Joy that is at this Meeting, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing humane Apprehen&s;ion! O the &s;weet Entertainment that God and the Soul gives each other at &s;uch a time! I appeal to the Experience of tho&s;e that have been much exerci&s;ed in this great Duty of <HI>Meditation,</HI> if they have been in good earne&s;t in the Work, I am confident they can &s;ay &s;omething to this Point.

When thou ha&s;t been in the Field, or Clo&s;et, at this Work, hath not Chri&s;t then taken you by the Hand, and led you into his Garden, and made you to ta&s;t of his plea&s;ant Fruits? Hath he not brought you in|to his banquetting Hou&s;e, and brought out &s;ome of his choice&s;t Dainties? Are not tho&s;e Flaggons more full of Spirit, more cordial and refre&s;hing than Wine?

A carnal world|ly Heart I mu&s;t confe&s;s may po&s;&s;ibly &s;poil this Du|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y, as all others, and grow formal in it, and be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">veary of it, and ca&s;t it off (though, let me put in this, I believe it's marvelous rare for a Hypocrite to have any thing to do in &s;uch a &s;ecret Duty as this is) but if they were true to the Intere&s;t of their own Souls in the Management of this Work, I am confident they would be every Day more and more in Love with this Duty: For I am per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">waded that when the Soul is in good earne&s;t, nay, I can &s;peak it po&s;itively, there is no Duty doth &s;o much rai&s;e and warm the Soul; there is no Duty wherein the People of God enjoy his &s;weet Com|pany more than in this. This opens the Trea|&s;ures, of God's Kindne&s;s; this takes his Love-to|kens and pre&s;ents them to the View of the Soul; this unlocks the Cabinets, and fetches out tho&s;e precious Jewels: By this the Soul doth, as it were, talk with its Beloved; and in this Chri&s;t doth, as it were, take the Soul by the Hand, and lead it into his Palace, and &s;hews it all tho&s;e glorious things, which it &s;hall &s;hortly have in her Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on for ever. And how can this choo&s;e but en|gage the Soul to expre&s;s its Gratitude to the height in an&s;wer to &s;uch Love; and when the Soul is in this Frame, Chri&s;t will not be behind hand with her, no Love &s;hall be lo&s;t between them; if the Spou&s;e walk out to look for her Beloved, &s;he &s;hall find him before &s;he hath done.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Duty by which the Soul doth vi&s;it. God in a &s;pecial manner, is <HI>Secret Prayer;</HI> by this the Soul knocks, and God is quick of hearing, and none of his Friends &s;hall wait without Doors &s;o long as to catch cold. By this the Soul doth
<PB N="310" REF="353">as it were &s;torm Heaven, by this it gets into the Pre&s;ence Chamber, and pre&s;ents its Reque&s;ts. In this Duty, a Chri&s;tian doth as it were turn the Key of Heaven's Doors, and by this he unlocks the Door of his own Soul; and &s;o there is free Ac|ce&s;s on both &s;ides, the Soul vi&s;its God, and God vi&s;its the Soul, and this creates an Intimacy. The poor wounded Creature opens his Wounds, and then the great Phy&s;ician comes with the Balm of <HI>Gilead.</HI> When <HI>Jacob</HI> is thus weeping and praying alone, he meets with God, he meets a Ble&s;&s;ing, he wre&s;tles, he conquers. This Duty of <HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> and that other of <HI>Meditation</HI> are two fat|ning Duties, by which the Souls of Believers come to God's Table, and eat, and drink of &s;trength|ning Food, and for want of the&s;e many poor Souls are thin. O why do Chri&s;tians, why do Profe&s;|&s;ors maintain no fairer Corre&s;pondency with God in &s;uch Duties wherein he doth manife&s;t him&s;elf more than ordinarily to the Soul? The Rea&s;on of this may be becau&s;e God accounts him&s;elf more highly honoured, and more truly loved by them which are much in the&s;e, than by others. By this a Man doth as it were honour the Goodne&s;s of God, in that it &s;hows it is worth the while to &s;teal out of the World, and to leave the be&s;t Company on Earth to go to God: He honours the Truth of God, by being earne&s;t for what God hath promi&s;ed though it be un&s;een; he honours the Omni&s;ciency of God, by contenting him&s;elf with his Eye and his Ear alone; he &s;anctifies his Omnipre&s;ence, by believing that his God can hear him and be with him in what Corner &s;oever he creeps into. I might be large in &s;peaking of the Excellencies of this Duty, but I refer it ra|ther
<PB N="311" REF="354">to another Place. But I would not be mi|&s;taken in what I have delivered, as if I would by this exclude Family Prayer, no, far be it from me; for God in the&s;e doth many times exceedingly re|fre&s;h his. But becau&s;e a Man can't po&s;&s;ibly judge &s;o well of him&s;elf by publick Prayer, as he can by &s;ecret: And Hypocri&s;y and Pride do not u|&s;ually &s;o much attend &s;ecret Duty, as more pub|lick. It's po&s;&s;ible in more publick Duty that a Man may be much rai&s;ed and be very warm and high in his Expre&s;&s;ions, and almo&s;t ravi&s;h the Hearts of his Hearers, whereas he may be all that while acted only by a proud Heart, and for all that I know the Devil him&s;elf may help a Man thus to pray &s;ometimes. This I am confident of, he is not afraid of &s;uch Prayers as the&s;e, which tend &s;o much to the hardening of a Sinner, and makes him believe that his Heart is warmed with Com|munion with God, when as it is po&s;&s;ible it is no|thing but a &s;ecret &s;elf-plea&s;ing, that tho&s;e that joined with him might think very highly of him, as one that was &s;piritual in his Performan|ces. O the Heart of Man is deep, and de&s;perate|ly full of Deceit! But now, there is none of this Temptation in &s;ecret Clo&s;et-Prayer, and there a Soul may be more particular in its Complaints and Petitions, more earne&s;t in pleading with God, and may u&s;e &s;uch Expo&s;tulations, Po&s;tures, Ge&s;tures, &s;uch Intermi&s;&s;ions, and Groanings, and Pau&s;es, as would be very unfit for more publick Duty. Wherefore I lay &s;omewhat the more Stre&s;s upon this Duty of <HI>Secret Prayer.</HI> But this I &s;ay again, where one of them is practi&s;ed con&s;ci|entiou&s;ly, the other will not be neglected: I might add the Practice and Experience of God's
<PB N="312" REF="355">Children to inforce this Duty. <HI>David</HI> would never have been at it &s;o oft at Midnight, if he had got nothing at all by it. <HI>Peter</HI> would &s;carce have forgot to eat, when he was an hungred, ex|cept he had met with a Bit in a Corner to &s;tay his Stomach.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Ea&s;ting,</HI> e&s;pecially private <HI>Fa&s;ting,</HI> is another Duty, wherein God meets the Soul, and the Soul vi&s;its God. This is as it were Execution Day, the Day when the Soul brings out all the Enemies of God to be crucified; this is the Day wherein the Idols are &s;earched for, brought out and buri|ed or ground to Powder, and the&s;e are things which God will come to &s;ee with much Delight. By this the Soul is as it were adorned, her Defor|mities done away, and &s;he is trimmed up to meet her Beloved. When a Saint fa&s;ts from Sin, and ab&s;tains from &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures, then it is many times fea&s;ted by God, and refre&s;hed with &s;piri|tual Enjoyments.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another &s;ea&s;on wherein God meets the Soul, and the Soul is vi&s;ited by God, is, when Chri&s;ti|ans are met together to communicate Experiences, or to di&s;cour&s;e together about the great things of God. What though mo&s;t of the World are a|&s;hamed to own Religion when it is out of fa&s;hion? What though but few dare meet together to &s;peak of God's Goodne&s;s, and to prai&s;e him, and call upon his Name? Why, Chri&s;t &s;ays, Though there be but two or three of them, he will make the number one the more, <HI>he will be in the mid&s;t of them:</HI> And though they dare but whi&s;per, it may be, and their Meetings to &s;erve God, and do good to one another, may be prohibited by the publick Magi&s;trate, and con&s;equently what they do in
<PB N="313" REF="356">this Kind mu&s;t be done with a great deal of Ha|zard, yet the People of God &s;tand not long di&s;pu|ting, they know what to do in this Ca&s;e, yet they would be wi&s;e in it too: not to dare the Magi|&s;trate, and to do what they do to confront Au|thority, but in the Uprightne&s;s of their Souls they de&s;ire to meet together to wor&s;hip God accord|ing to his own Will. Yet for all this, though they manage their Bu&s;ine&s;s with never &s;o much Secre&s;ie, God will take Notice of them, he hear|kens and hears, and a Book of Remembrance is writ|ten for them that call oft upon his Name, and God will make them up among his Jewels. But I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of &s;omething to this Purpo&s;e afterwards, and therefore I pa&s;s it over the more briefly.</P>

<HEAD>IV. DIRECTION.</HEAD>
<P>If you would get acquainted with God, get Chri&s;t along with you, when you go to God. You are like to &s;peed no way &s;o &s;oon as this way: nay, let me &s;ay, all that I have &s;aid before &s;igni|fies nothing at all without this. There is no Name under Heaven, by which we can be &s;aved, but by the Name of Chri&s;t! and who&s;oever comes to the Father, by him, he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out. God can't deny his own Son any thing, he can never forget that great Undertaking of his, by which he glorified his Father's infinite Ju&s;tice, and infinite Love, and did him more Honour than all the Saints and Angels in the World. His Son, the Lord Chri&s;t, hath &s;uch an Intere&s;t in his Fa|ther, that he can as &s;oon de&s;pi&s;e his own Honour as to refu&s;e any Reque&s;t that is pre&s;ented to him, by his Son. If Chri&s;t come to him and &s;ay, Fa|ther, here is a poor Sinner that I have undertaken
<PB N="314" REF="357">for, and that flew to me for Refuge. Look up|on him for my &s;ake; why, the Father's Arms are pre&s;ently open; he will not reject his Son's Peti|tions. The Truth of it is, this is the greate&s;t Cau&s;e of the Mi&s;carriage of poor Creatures, that go about to do that them&s;elves, and by them|&s;elves, which they can never do alone. They go to God all alone, and no wonder then they meet with a Frown; for there is no Name under Hea|ven, by which a Man can be &s;aved, but by the Name of Chri&s;t; and out of Chri&s;t, God is a con|&s;uming Fire; and there is but one <HI>Mediator,</HI> the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us. And there is but one Advo|cate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous. That which <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> &s;aid of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> God &s;aith of Chri&s;t, except you bring <HI>Benjamin</HI> along with you, you &s;hall not &s;ee my Face; except you bring Chri&s;t along with you, you &s;hall not &s;ee my Face. There is a notable Story, which is commonly by Divines applied to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, and that not without good Rea&s;on; it is concerning a Law among the <HI>Molo&s;&s;ians,</HI> where who&s;oever came to the King with his Son in his Arms &s;hould be ac|cepted into Favour, let his Fault be what it will. So let a Man be what he will before, yet if he come to God in Chri&s;t, he can't be thru&s;t a|way. O therefore if thou would&s;t have any Countenance from God, beg for a Chri&s;t to bear thee Company into the Pre&s;ence of God. I will tell you this for your Comfort, Chri&s;t hath a lo|ving De&s;ign in his Heart to do &s;uch Offices of Kindne&s;s for poor Malefactors that under&s;tand &s;omething of their Danger. If you &s;ee your &s;elf lo&s;t for want of Reconciliation with God; Chri&s;t he &s;tands ready to lead you into his Father's Hou&s;e.
<PB N="315" REF="358">O did you but know how willing he is to bring un|done lo&s;t Penitents to God, it would make your Heart leap within you for Joy. Behold, how oft he asks after you; what doth that Sinner mean to ruin him&s;elf? I would with all my Heart bring him out of all the&s;e Perplexities, and un|dertake to make God and him Friends, if he would be but rul'd by me; and upon this Ac|count he &s;ends up and down many hundreds of his Mini&s;ters, to tell Sinners as much, that they may not be undone everla&s;tingly. Doth not Wi&s;dom call? doth not Chri&s;t plead the Cau&s;e, and expo&s;tulate with Sinners? and who would not, that hath any Under&s;tanding at all of his State out of Chri&s;t, with all po&s;&s;ible Thankful|ne&s;s, be encouraged to accept of his Kindne&s;s? Chri&s;t hath done as much as this comes to alrea|dy, for many Millions, and his Father never &s;aid to him, Son, why do you trouble your &s;elf and me with &s;o many of the&s;e wretched Creatures, let them alone to take their Cour&s;e. Where did God ever expre&s;s him&s;elf in this Manner? did he ever take it unkindly that his Son &s;hould eve|ry Day bring &s;uch Gue&s;ts to his Hou&s;e, and be continually begging one Boon or other for them, or putting up &s;ome Petitions upon their Account, or pleading with his Father for them when they do offend. Is God di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;uch Work as this? is he not as willing to receive &s;uch, as his Son is to bring them? and both Father and Son more willing to &s;ave the Sinner, than he is to be &s;aved? O Kindne&s;s! Chri&s;t loves the Sinner better than he loves him&s;elf! and as I &s;aid before, &s;o I &s;ay again, the Father doth not grutch any thing that Chri&s;t gives or doth for poor Sinners. The
<PB N="316" REF="359">Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, it is that Wedding-gar|ment, in which we may &s;it at the King's Table, and are welcome; the&s;e are the Robes of our el|der Brother, in which we can't mi&s;s of our Fa|ther's Ble&s;&s;ing. O how many poor Creatures have walked in the dark many Years, becau&s;e they have not been brought off from them&s;elves, but have &s;ought that by them&s;elves, which is to be &s;ought only by Chri&s;t; becau&s;e they have looked for that in the Law, which is to be found only in the Go&s;pel; and no wonder their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s went on &s;o &s;lowly, when they went the quite contrary Way to work. When any comes to God without Chri&s;t, they come like <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> with their own Money in their Hand to buy a great Commodity, which is not to be purcha&s;ed with &s;uch kind of Coin. If you come to God through Chri&s;t, you may come with Boldne&s;s to the Throne of Grace; but if you come without him, you do but come with Madne&s;s upon the Point of the flaming Sword.</P>

<PB N="320" REF="363">of their &s;leepy, unbelieving, ignorant Companions: they have an inward Principle which puts them upon communicating what Grace they have re|ceived; they know the more they impart to o|thers, the more they &s;hall have them&s;elves; they have a Compa&s;&s;ion for Souls, and would fain have as many as they can along with them to Heaven: they will be teaching little Children to pray, and in&s;tilling &s;omething that the very Babes may &s;et forth God's Prai&s;es, and they will be pleading with God for them. But this only by the by. Now if tho&s;e that are gracious endeavour what they can to bring in tho&s;e that are open Enemies; how much more will they be ready to give all the Help they can to you that earne&s;tly de&s;ire it? Now when any one comes to this pa&s;s, that he &s;ees a Difference between the godly and the wicked, and to &s;ay that the righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour, and to have an earne&s;t De|&s;ire to a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves with them, it is a very great Sign that God hath an Intention to do &s;uch a Soul good. Wherefore if you would be brought to the Knowledge of God, go &s;peedily to them that know him well, and they will tell you great things of him, and how they came fir&s;t acquainted with him, and how this Acquaintance hath been kept up; they will tell you where they fir&s;t met him, they will give you to under&s;tand that at &s;uch and &s;uch a time, when they little thought of God, they were &s;trangely brought acquainted with him. When they came (out of Fa&s;hion, or Curio&s;ity, or to laugh at him that taught them, or it may be to pick &s;ome Quarrel with him) to hear &s;uch a Man; they were made to &s;ee what they never took any great Notice of before, that they were
<PB N="321" REF="364">in an undone Condition by Nature, and that ex|cept Chri&s;t would pity them, there was no Reme|dy, but to Hell they mu&s;t go; whereas before they thought them&s;elves as &s;afe as could be: But then they &s;aw it was no light Matter to be out of Chri&s;t, and Aliens from the Common-wealth of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> After this they were made to under&s;tand &s;omething of Chri&s;t's Undertaking for poor lo&s;t Sinners, and they heard of his exceeding willing|ne&s;s to receive the chiefe&s;t of Sinners, and that then they began to &s;ee an Excellency in his Love, and Goodne&s;s, and to be &s;omewhat more taken with the Kindne&s;s of Chri&s;t than ever they were before, and they felt &s;ome Longings after the precious Je&s;us, O that they had but a Chri&s;t for their Souls! and that after this they were by the Spirit of God, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, enabled to ca&s;t them&s;elves at the Feet of Chri&s;t for Mercy, and that upon his own Terms, knowing that if Mer|cy came not that Way to them, they mu&s;t &s;ink for ever; and that upon this Act of Recumbency after they had for &s;ome time waited upon God in the Way of his Ordinances, they began to ta&s;t and reli&s;h the Things of God, and at la&s;t they met him whom their Souls loved. Inquire of them, I &s;ay, and they will talk thus to you, and tell you al&s;o, that there was a time wherein they were fooli&s;h, di&s;obedient, and unto every good Work reprobate, and mi&s;erably neglectful of their Souls, that they did not at all mind their eternal Wel|fare, but made light of Chri&s;t, made a Mock of Sin, and made nothing of eternal Dammation. And they will direct and encourage you al&s;o. Let me tell you, they have an Intere&s;t in God, and their Prayers for you may be more advantagious
<PB N="322" REF="365">than you are aware of. Yet I would not that you &s;hould make Chri&s;ts of the Saints, nor forget what is the Work of the Mediator alone. Saints are to be valued, but Chri&s;t is to be valued in&s;i|nitely more. Get acquainted with &s;ome warm rare experienced Chri&s;tian, and make him your Bo&s;om-Friend, and ob&s;erve him, and you &s;hall &s;ee much of the Beauty of Religion &s;hining in him, and you &s;hall &s;ee how cheerfully and comfortably he walks: now ask him what his Practice is, and go you, and do likewi&s;e; have a Care of harbour|ing ill Thoughts of the People of God, or for the Sake of one Hypocrite, of cen&s;uring a thou|&s;and &s;incere ones. Judge you whether this be ju&s;t and equal doing? How would you like it, if one that bares &s;ome Relation to you, &s;hould do &s;ome vile abominable thing, and bring him&s;elf to an untimely End, and People &s;hould &s;ay all the whole Family is like him? though it may be you are grieved to the very Heart that &s;uch a thing &s;hould be done by any in the World, much more by any that bears any kind of Relation to your &s;elf. I tell you, as contemptibly as the World &s;peak of the Godly, they are not &s;uch odious Creatures as they are repre&s;ented to be. The Saints they are not Troublers but Peace-makers, they love to make Peace between Man and Man, and what in them lies al&s;o between God and Man: your Conver&s;e with &s;uch as fear the Lord will make you like them, at lea&s;t they will endeavour as much.

Such as the&s;e will from their own Experience be &s;etting forth the Goodne&s;s of God, and tell you that which may &s;tand you in &s;tead as long as you live: it may be they may tell you, that when God began fir&s;t to work upon their Soul, he was pleas'd to make u&s;e of the particular Application, and the &s;piritual Conver&s;ation of &s;uch a Chri&s;tian Relation; and when God came in with Comfort, and &s;pake Peace, &s;uch a one led them to &s;uch a Promi&s;e, which was like a Cordial to their fainting Soul. When they were abroad, (they will tell you) and were nece&s;&s;itated to the Company of them which were Strangers to the Life of Religion; and were at &s;uch a time troubled with horrible Temptations; that they were in a Wilderne&s;s Condition, and thought that never any that walked Heaven-ward, could be in the like State; but now when they got acquainted with the People of God, they found that as Face an&s;wereth Face in a Gla&s;s, &s;o their Experience, and the Experience of many of
<PB N="324" REF="367">the dear Children of God was axactly alike; and that that which they thought none in the World could parellel, they find that mo&s;t of the Chri|&s;tians that they meet with, know as well as them|&s;elves, and at the fir&s;t Hearing, are able to go on with the Story before them, &s;o that they have &s;ometimes wondred how any one living &s;hould know their Hearts and Thoughts &s;o well, to whom they did not communicate them. I think it not altogether impertinent here to in&s;ert an Ob&s;er|vation of my own. I remember when I was once &s;peaking concerning the Duty of Chri&s;tians in re|lation to their unconverted Friends, and urging them upon doing what they could for God, and Souls, in the Places where God had &s;et them: in &s;peaking to this Subject, I &s;aid, that there was not the meane&s;t Chri&s;tian, but might be an In&s;tru|ment of the Conver&s;ion of a Soul. Upon this I rehear&s;ed a couple of Experiences that I had of two Per&s;ons, Strangers one to the other, who gave this Account of their Conver&s;ion; they were upon the Matter both alike, and therefore I &s;hall tell but one of them, which take as follows. There was a poor, civil, yet very carnal Creature, a Servant in a religious Family, who did from his Soul abhor the Spiritual Conver&s;ation of tho&s;e in the Family, in&s;omuch that he was re&s;olved to run away from his Service, he was &s;o weary of &s;uch Doings: But one Night, hearing a &s;trange Sound &s;omewhere, he ro&s;e out of his Bed, and went to li&s;ten what was the Matter; upon which he heard one di&s;tinctly praying on the other Side of the Wall, he &s;till hearkening, heard one praying ve|ry earne&s;tly for him (who did not know but he might be a&s;leep) and opening the Condition of
<PB N="325" REF="368">his Soul &s;o particularly, and with &s;o much Ten|derne&s;s, that he was wonderfully awakened, to think that one that he hated &s;hould &s;o much love him, and pity his Soul, and to con&s;ider how it was po&s;&s;ible any one in the World &s;hould know his Thoughts &s;o well as that Per&s;on did who prayed for him; upon this, he began to be very much &s;tartled to think of his Condition, concluding thus, Surely I am in a lamentable State, and they &s;ee it, or el&s;e they would never do as they do, they are praying for me when I am a&s;leep, they love me when I hate them; upon this the Man was very much troubled, and his Trouble daily increa&s;ed, till he was forced to open his Condi|tion to the Per&s;on who had been praying for him, which was a poor Maid-&s;ervant; upon which the Work of Regeneration was carried on very &s;weet|ly, and the Man became an excellent Chri&s;tian, whereas the In&s;trument that God u&s;ed in this great Work was but a poor Servant. Now when I re|hear&s;ed this thing, which was the Condition of two, as I &s;aid before, a third Per&s;on &s;tood by, (whom I never &s;aw in my Life before) who fell a Sweating for Trouble, that any of his Friends &s;hould tell &s;uch a thing of him to me, and thought I had meant him&s;elf in all the Particulars, though I heard not a Word of the Man before in my Life. This by the by. I could not but hint this for the Encouragement of Parents to get their Children into Families that are really religious, and to en|courage all to a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves to &s;uch as fear the Lord. You &s;ee by what hath been &s;poken, that Acquaintance with the People of God, may be of great U&s;e for the bringing the Soul acquaint|ed with God.</P>

<P>If you would be acquainted with God, enter|tain all the Me&s;&s;engers that he &s;ends to you kind|ly. When God calls, an&s;wer; and when he &s;ends any of his Servants to you, bid them welcome; Let the Feet of tho&s;e which bring glad Tidings be beautiful in your Eye; Do not think much if they deal plainly and roundly with you, know that it is out of Love to your Souls (God is their wit|ne&s;s) they &s;ee that your Condition requires it, and that a Man in your State is not to be je&s;ted with. The Lord knows that they take little Plea&s;ure in grieving of People; they do it that you may rejoice for ever, they watch for your Souls, and therefore you mu&s;t account them wor|thy of double Honour. But of all the Me&s;&s;engers that God &s;ends, have the greate&s;t Care of dealing unkindly with, and grieving his Spirit; when you have any Motions upon your Soul by the Spirit, labour to cheri&s;t them with all the Care and Tenderne&s;s that you can. Turn not. Convictions away with, I am not at Lei&s;ure, or I will hear you of the&s;e things when I have a more convenient Sea&s;on: but as &s;oon as you find your Heart begin to relent, cry out unto the Lord, and &s;ay, O Lord, I be&s;eech thee, carry on thy Work effectually upon my Soul! O that I may have through Work! O let not the&s;e Convictions wear off from my Soul till they end in a real Con|ver&s;ion! O let me not prove but a half Chri&s;tian! Any thing in the World, Lord, &s;o that I may but be made a Chri&s;tian in good Earne&s;t! O let me not return with the Dog to his Vomit, and
<PB N="327" REF="370">with the Sow that is wa&s;hed, to her Wallowing in the Mire! Deliver me, O God, from &s;inning away the&s;e things, and getting into a cold World, and from &s;haking off all, lea&s;t I prove wor&s;e than ever, and my latter End be more mi&s;erable than my Beginning. Labour to be very curious in the taking Notice of God's Ab&s;ence or Pre&s;ence; and when you find your Soul rai&s;ed in any Duty, and your Heart &s;omewhat drawn out after God, then be &s;ure to own God's Goodne&s;s, and ble&s;s the Lord for it; Record his Kindne&s;s, forget not his Mercy, pa&s;s not over &s;uch great Things in Silence.

Believe it, Sirs, Heaven and Glory are not got with &s;itting &s;till with our Hands in our Pockets. We think it worth the while to ri&s;e early, and
<PB N="328" REF="371">to &s;it up late, to get an earthly E&s;tate; we count it no fooli&s;h thing for a Man to be very diligent about his worldly Affairs. The poor Country|man plows and &s;ows, harrows, weeds, reaps, inns, thre&s;heth, and a great deal more, before he can eat his Bread; and &s;hall we look for a rich Crop, and do nothing at all but eat and drink, and &s;leep? Is this the Way to be rich? is this the Way to be happy for ever? If you intend to do any thing in Religion to any purpo&s;e, you mu&s;t buckle to your Bu&s;ine&s;s at another gue&s;s Rate than mo&s;t of the Profe&s;&s;ors of the World do. We mu&s;t take as much Pains about our Souls as Men do about their Bodies or E&s;tates.

Which are Matters of the greate&s;t Con|&s;equence, Eating and Drinking, and Pampering the Fle&s;h, and taking our Plea&s;ure; or looking after Life, Salvation, and eternal Joy? Do you think that the Scripture faith in vain, <HI>That we mu&s;t &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate?</HI> Is it a bare &s;eeking that will &s;erve the Turn? Will a, <HI>Lord have Mer|cy upon me,</HI> and bowing the Knee, do as well as the greate&s;t Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Diligence in the Would?

Doth not Chri&s;t &s;ay, <HI>That many &s;hall &s;eek to enter in, and &s;hall not be able?</HI> O why do not lazy Profe&s;&s;ors read the Scriptures with Trembling? Let all tho&s;e that are angry with

If we tell you of the Danger of a formal Religion, you will &s;oon fall upon us as E|nemies to your Peace, and tho&s;e which impo&s;e too much Strictne&s;s upon you: We therefore do here produce our Commi&s;&s;ion for what we &s;ay, or ra|ther we de&s;ire you but to read your &s;elves what Chri&s;t &s;poke as touching this Matter. O it might ju&s;tly make a Chri&s;tian's Heart to ake, to think how many thou&s;ands of Profe&s;&s;ors willbe di&s;own|ed by Chri&s;t in that Day, who will make many fair Pleas for them&s;elves, and pretend a great deal of Acquaintance with him. Con&s;ider, I be|&s;eech you, here is no Fear of Exce&s;s; never any Man in the World that was too &s;ollicitous about his Salvation, never any Man took too much Pains for Heaven. Awake, O Sleeper, what mean|e&s;t thou? ari&s;e, and call upon thy God. If you make any thing of the Lo&s;s of a Soul, look about you; if you think the Wrath to come con&s;idera|ble, be &s;erious; if you would not be burnt by the Fire of his Indignation; you mu&s;t take hold of his Strength, and make Peace with him, and God will be at Peace with you, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 27.5.

Yet in God's E&s;teem, all this goes for nothing at all, this Prayer is no Prayer, this is only wording of it with God.

It is one thing to engage the Tongue, and another thing to engage the Heart. Men come to pray with a common Spirit, and are many times weary of the Work before they have well begun it; what they do, they do it lifele&s;sly: They can follow their worldly Imployments with Life and Delight. They have a Male in their Flock, but that's too good for God; a lame, blind, &s;tar|ved weak thing mu&s;t &s;erve his Turn: And is this the way to have the Ble&s;&s;ing?

Then &s;hall you under&s;tand the Fear of the Lord, and find the Knowledge of God.</HI> What excellent thing is there, that is got without pains? Whoever came to be an exqui&s;ite curious Arti&s;t in any Skill whatever, that never &s;erved an Ap|prentice&s;hip to it, nor at the lea&s;t gave his Mind to it? Where is there a famous Phy&s;ician that ne|ver &s;tudied in his Life? Who gets a Victory by Sleeping and Carle&s;ne&s;s? Who expects to have Riches drop into his Mouth, when he goes all the Ways that can be to make him&s;elf a Beggar? Doth the Husbandman look for a good Grop without plowing or &s;owing? Why then &s;hould we expect &s;uch great things as Heaven, Eternal Happine&s;s, and the Favour of God, without looking after them. What&s;oever the lazy formal Profe&s;&s;or may &s;ay, the Kingdom of Heaven is not obtained thus: There mu&s;t be running, watch|ing, fighting, conquering, holding fa&s;t, holding out, and all little enough; it requires all the Strength of thy Soul to engage in this great Work; it requires &s;ome Re&s;o&s;ution to do &s;uch a Work, as every Chri&s;tian mu&s;t do, or el&s;e his Re|ligion &s;ignifies little. Further, it calls for &s;ome time too, it is not a thing to be minded now and then by the by, between &s;leep and awake, when the Devil and the World have had as much Ser|vice as they call for. Were it for your Bodies that I were now pleading, were you like to get any great matter in the World by following of my Directions; could you be &s;how'd a way how to get a great E&s;tate, Honours, and long Life, I am
<PB N="332" REF="375">verily per&s;waded a few Words might prevail much. Why, if you will believe the Word of God, I am telling you of other kind of things than the&s;e be, greater Matters by far; and yet how little are Men and Women affected? As if we &s;poke but in je&s;t always, when we &s;poke about things that did concern Souls! How little time do Men &s;pend in their Inquiry into the&s;e things? Ask <HI>Epictetus</HI> (<HI>Ench. c.</HI> 63.) and he will tell you that it is a Sign of a low Soul; to be&s;tow much time upon thy Body, and the Thoughts of it, and little upon the Soul; to be long eating, and long drinking, and long a dre&s;&s;ing, and &s;hort in Pray|er, &s;hort in the Thoughts of the Soul, and &s;hort in the Service of God; and that it is a Sign of a ba&s;e degenerate Spirit to be very curious about Toys, and incon&s;iderable Trifles, and to be neg|ligent about Matters of the greate&s;t Importance, to &s;lubber over the great Works of Religion with the greate&s;t Slightne&s;s. Remember, O Man, thy great Work, it is to take care of thy Soul, to look after a Companion, a Friend for thy Soul, to get Food and Cloathing for thy Soul, that fa|mi&s;h not with hunger and cold. To be indifferent in all Externals is the greate&s;t Prudence; but to be indifferent about Spirituals and Eternals is the greate&s;t Madne&s;s. We are all Souldiers, and mu&s;t fight in &s;uch a War wherein we mu&s;t never lay down our Arms. The Favour of God is worth the &s;triving for, it is as much as Heaven and Glo|ry is worth. If your E&s;tate or Life lay at Stake, would you not be willing to u&s;e all the Intere&s;t you could to make the Judge your Friend? Would you go up and down laughing as if you had nothing to do? Would you eat and drink as merrily as e|ver,
<PB N="333" REF="376">and &s;ay, it is but dying, it is but being a Beggar, it is but the undoing of my Wife and Children? Would you not look upon a Man that &s;hould argue at this rate to be little better than frantick? And I pray which is mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble, the Death of the Body, or the Death of the Soul; the Lo&s;s of a temporal, or the Lo&s;s of an eternal Inheritance. Mo&s;t Mens Diligence in Temporals will condemn their Negligence in Spirituals.

No &s;uch matter, never expect it, God mu&s;t &s;ooner cea&s;e to be, than to gratify you in this. Wherefore do you think did <HI>David</HI> follow his Work &s;o clo&s;e? Why did all tho&s;e noble Wor|thies in the Church of old take &s;o much Pains? Why &s;hould they not much &s;tick to venture E|&s;tates and Lives too? Will you condemn them all as guilty of too much Curio&s;ity, and unnece&s;&s;ary Preci&s;ene&s;s? Do you think that their Labour was in vain? Are all tho&s;e di&s;appointed, who willing|ly parted with pre&s;ent things for future things? I mu&s;t tell you, if you expect to &s;it down with <HI>A|braham, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> in the Kingdom of Hea|ven, you mu&s;t do as they did. Heaven will not be obtained now upon any lower Terms than then.

You may then indeed learn; but believe it, your Knowledge and Learning will do you little good; you may then learn what it is to be mi&s;erable, but you can't learn how to get out of it; you will know what you have lo&s;t, but then you will never know how to repair your Lo&s;&s;es.

<PB N="343" REF="386">Sin and Age, when your Back begins to bend, and your Joints to &s;hake? Do you think you &s;hall be more at lei&s;ure, when your Work will be much increa&s;ed? Know this, that Sin grows upon you daily, it preys upon your Vitals: He that is not fit to Day, will be le&s;s fit to morrow. As for Lei&s;ure, I mu&s;t confe&s;s you may have Lei&s;ure e|nough in another World, to think of the&s;e things. But I wi&s;h you well to con&s;ider whether it be great Wi&s;dom to repent in this World, or in a|nother. I would be loath to be repenting in ano|ther, it's &s;ad weeping indeed there, where Tears &s;hall never be dried up. I have told you oft that God &s;aith, To Day, and it is both wickedly and fooli&s;hly done of Man to &s;ay, To morrow. I mu&s;t tell you but &s;o, that it is a dreadful Hazard that every delaying Sinner doth run: It is a Que&s;tion whether God may not deny his Grace, &s;top the Preacher's Mouth, &s;top his Ears, and &s;top your Breath: And where are you then, with your <HI>to morrow?</HI> Delays in the&s;e Affairs always co&s;t dear; they have co&s;t many thou&s;ands dear already, and if you make no more ha&s;t than you have done, they will co&s;t you dear too.</P>

<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 4. Who de&s;erves be&s;t at your Hands, the Devil, the World, and the Fle&s;h, or God? Re&s;olve me this I pray? Whom do you call your Ma&s;ter? Whom have you mo&s;t Rea&s;on to make ha&s;t for?</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="387"><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 5. How would you take it, if any of them which depend upon you, &s;hould &s;erve you as you &s;erve God?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 6. Do you think you can make too much Ha&s;t? Who is afraid of being rich too &s;oon? Although a Man may with Rea&s;on good enough be afraid of that which may make his Happine&s;s far more uncertain, and his Mi&s;eries more intolerable. Who fears to make too much Ha&s;t, when his Prince &s;ends for him with Speed? O that Men did but know who it is that calls them, and whether they are going, and what they have to do, when they come to their Jour|ney's End!</P>

Have you never known a Man well one Hour, and dead the next? If you have not, I tell you of one now, that was very well one Moment, and dead the next, my &s;elf being an Eye-witne&s;s of it. It's po&s;&s;ible there may be but one &s;mall Moment be|tween a &s;trong working healthful Man, and a breathle&s;s Corps.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 8. What do you think will become of you, I ask again, if you put off Repentance till it be too late?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 9. What would you do, if you were &s;ure you &s;hould die, or the Day of Judgment come before you were a Week older?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 10. Do you think to get acquainted with God in another World, when you do not mind him here? Will God, think you, own them hereafter, that di&s;own him here? Will he

<P>If you would be acquainted with God, take heed of tho&s;e things, which keep God and Man at a Di&s;tance, and make the Lord take no Plea|&s;ure in us.

In <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 101. <HI>David</HI> is ex|ceeding de&s;irous of God's Company, and he cries out, <HI>O when wilt thou come unto me!</HI> he thinks long to have a Vi&s;it from his old Friend; he would gladly walk with him. Now what Cour&s;e doth he take to get God's Company? Why, he goes the be&s;t Way to work in the World: He will &s;et no wicked thing before his Eyes. He knows it is to no purpo&s;e for him to expect much of God's Company, while he doth entertain his greate&s;t Enemies; therefore he turns them out of Doors: <HI>I hate,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>the Works of them that turn a&s;ide, it &s;hall not cleave to me.</HI> And that God may dwell with him, and make his Hou&s;e, as well as his Heart, a Temple for him&s;elf; he will not &s;uffer a wicked Per&s;on to live in it; he will have none in his Family, but &s;uch as &s;hall be ready to &s;erve God, and bid this his great Friend wel|come.</P>
<P>But more particular, if you would have much
<PB N="346" REF="389">of God's Company, and be intimately acquainted with him; take heed more e&s;pecially of tho&s;e particular Sins, which make God mo&s;t to e&s;trange him&s;elf from Man; as,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Take heed of Pride: That was the Sin which made the fir&s;t Breach between the Crea|ture and the Creator; the Sin that &s;unk the An|gels, that made God and them, who were very good Friends once, to be bitter Enemies; this hath made the Breach infinite, the Feud everla&s;t|ing, the Wound incurable. And this made the fir&s;t Quarrel between God and Man. When Man thinks him&s;elf too good to be but a Man, he mu&s;t be a God; be quickly is too bad to be a Man, he is but one Remove from the Devil. To be a Fa|vourite of his Prince is not enough, except he may &s;tep into the Throne; it's therefore high time for his Prince to remove &s;uch from his Pre&s;ence to a Pri&s;on, from the Court to the Dungeon. It was Pride that ca&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> out of Paradi&s;e; and do you think that that Sin is le&s;s hateful to God, and le&s;s dangerous to Man, than it was five thou|&s;and Years ago? Did it then &s;pend all its Poi&s;on? and can it now do no Harm? Do you believe that God will take that into his Bo&s;om now, that formerly he abhorr'd to look upon? Now Sin hath increa&s;ed its Strength and Deformity, and heightened its Enmity again&s;t the infinite Ma|je&s;ty of the holy <HI>Jehovah,</HI> &s;hall his Hatred again&s;t it decrea&s;e? Will he be more willing to accom|pany proud a&s;piring Rebels now than then? No &s;uch matter, God is &s;till as holy as ever, and hates all Sin, e&s;pecially Pride, as much as ever. Do you think that it is for nothing that the Word of God &s;peaks &s;o much again&s;t this Sin? Can it be

And let me &s;ay, he that &s;ets him&s;elf above God (for that's the Pride I mean) whil&s;t he &s;tands in that State, mu&s;t never expect that God &s;hould look upon him with any Kindne&s;s. Heaven and Hell will as &s;oon be agreed as God and &s;uch a one &s;hall be united. The proud now overlook others that are their Betters, and &s;corn their Maker; but &s;hortly they &s;hall be paid in their own Coin; they &s;hall be &s;corned too. If all the proud <HI>Nimrods, Pharaohs,</HI> and <HI>Bel&s;hazzars</HI> in the World &s;hould enter into a League, and com|bine again&s;t the Almighty, and &s;ay, they will ca&s;t away his Cords from them, and that they will never deba&s;e their noble Spirits &s;o low as to &s;toop to his Commands; yet none of them all &s;hall go unpuni&s;hed: they &s;hall be like Stubble be|fore the devouring Flames, and like Chaff before a mighty Whirlwind: God is not afraid of their big Looks, <HI>Prov.</HI> 21.4. <HI>Prov.</HI> 6.17. <HI>Prov.</HI> 15. 25. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 2.12. <HI>Luke</HI> 1.51. <HI>Jam.</HI> 4.6. God will
<PB N="348" REF="391">clothe him&s;elf with Vengeance, and the mighty <HI>Jehovah</HI> will gird his Weapon upon his Thigh, and march out in Fury and Indignation, and draw his glittering Sword, and re&s;i&s;t the proud, and teach them what it is to bid Defiance to the Lord of Ho&s;ts. We &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee, who &s;hall be upper|mo&s;t, God or they. And when the proud Sinner lies conquered at his Feet, how doth he, with in|finite Scorn look upon him, and &s;ay, <HI>Behold, the Man is become like one of us!</HI> This 'tis for a Man to attempt the Dethroning of the Almighty! But it may be, mo&s;t may think them&s;elves little concerned in that which I now &s;peak; wherefore I mu&s;t add this one Word. Be it known unto thee, O Man, who&s;oever thou art, that think'&s;t thou ha&s;t no Pride; I am &s;ure thou art one of tho&s;e that are in that black Roll which have pro|claimed War again&s;t Heaven; thou art the Man that &s;hall never be acquainted with God whil'&s;t thou art in that Mind. It may be thou may'&s;t &s;peak Peace to thy &s;elf for all this, and flatter thy &s;elf as if God and you were Friends; but let me tell thee, I come with heavy Tidings in my Mouth to thee: if thou turn not, he will whet his Sword, he hath bent his Bow, and made it ready, he hath prepared for thee the In&s;truments of Death; the Day of thy Calamity is near: the dreadful <HI>Jehovah</HI> is upon his March, and if you ask me whether there be not Peace for thee, I an|&s;wer as <HI>Jehu</HI> did to <HI>Jehoram,</HI> what Peace, O haughty Sinner, &s;o long as the Pride of thy Heart is &s;o great, and thy Rebellions again&s;t thy Maker &s;o many; <HI>there is no Peace, &s;aith my God, to the wicked.</HI> Wherefore, as your value your Soul, as you tender your everla&s;ting Salvation, and de|&s;ire
<PB N="349" REF="392">to be owned by the Lord in the Day of your Di&s;tre&s;s, take heed of Pride. Go quickly, and humble your &s;elf, and make &s;ure your Friend; labour to pull down every high Thought, and e|very proud Imagination; and let your arrogant Spirit bow before the mighty God; there is no Way will do but this, as ye have already heard; you mu&s;t &s;et the Crown upon the Lord's Head, you mu&s;t lay your &s;elves at his Feet, and lick the very Du&s;t. Your Betters have done &s;o before you, and have thought it their Honour to lie at the Feet of Chri&s;t; this they looked upon (with good Rea&s;on too) as the fir&s;t Step to Preferment. If therefore you would be acquainted with God, take heed of Pride.</P>
<P>Secondly, take heed of a worldly Mind. What Concord is there between Earth and Heaven? what Agreement between God and the World? What Delight can his Holine&s;s take in him, who had rather be wallowing in the Mud, and tread|ing of Clay, than bathing him&s;elf in Divine Con|templation; that thinks it higher Preferment to &s;it by his Bags of Gold, than to &s;tand in the Pre&s;ence of his God: a greater Happine&s;s to be rich, than to be Holy: that had much rather be in a Fair, Market or Exchange, getting Mony, than with his God, getting Pardon, Grace and Heaven, How pregnant is the Scripture of Proofs for the evidencing of this Truth? to name one or two of a hundred, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.7. <HI>To be carnally mind|ed is Enmity again&s;t God: for it is not &s;ubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can it be.</HI> What do you &s;ay to this Scripture? Tho&s;e which walk with God, live in the World, and yet they live above the World; they all look for a City that hath
<PB N="350" REF="393">Foundations, who&s;e Builder and Maker is God. It was not for nothing that the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> lays &s;o &s;trict a Charge upon tho&s;e which he wrote to, <HI>That they &s;hould not love the World, nor the things of the World: for if any love the World, the Love of the Father is not in them,</HI> 1 John 2.15. Whence is it that &s;o few great ones go to Heaven, and that it is next to impo&s;&s;ible for &s;uch to be &s;aved? Is it not becau&s;e they have cho&s;en <HI>Mammon</HI> for their Friend, rather than God? He hath their Heart, their Love, their Time and Service, and they have little to &s;pare for God, and therefore God hath but a little Happine&s;s, a little Heaven, a &s;hort Glory for them, they &s;hall have but a little of his &s;weet Company, little Acquaintance with him. Why doth <HI>James</HI> &s;peak &s;o terribly to the rich Men, and bid them go, and weep and howl? was it not becau&s;e their Riches were like to undo them? Did the wealthy Man in the Parable live ever the longer for his Riches, or fare ever the better for his Greatne&s;s, when he came into ano|ther World? there is no que&s;tion but he might have more Flatterers; there is no Doubt but he had more worldly Friends; but bring me a Man upon the Earth, that lets his Heart without Con|troul fly upon the World, cleaves to it, and takes it to be his be&s;t Friend, that knows God, that's acquainted with his Maker, that prizeth his Redeemer. It was a wi&s;e Man who &s;aid, That it's ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to mind Externals and Internals, this World and another, with Earne&s;t|ne&s;s, at the &s;ame time: but it was Wi&s;dom it &s;elf who &s;aid, <HI>That no Servant can &s;erve two Ma&s;ters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> el&s;e he will hold to the one, and de&s;pi&s;e the other; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="351" REF="394">cannot &s;erve God and Mammon,</HI> Matth. 5.24.</P>
<P N="3">3. Take heed of Hypocri&s;ie. Who are the Per|&s;ons that God doth denounce his dreadful Threat|nings again&s;t? are they not &s;uch as <HI>honour him with their Lips, when their Hearts are far from him?</HI> with what Abhorrency doth he look upon &s;uch, and all that they do? <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 1. They never bring their Heart to vi&s;it God with, and therefore they have little Rea&s;on to expect that he &s;hould bring his Dainties to entertain them with.</P>
<P N="4">4. If you would be acquainted with God, take heed of being acquainted with wicked Company. We read that many wicked Men have fared the better for the Company of the godly; but we &s;carce ever heard that any godly Man ever fared the better for being in the Company of the wick|ed, except they went on God's Errand among&s;t them. This is clear in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Lot,</HI> who fir&s;t lo&s;t his Goods, and was made a Captive by being in <HI>Sodom;</HI> and though they were re&s;tored to him again for a while; (one would have thought that &s;hould have been a fair Warning how he came a|gain into &s;uch Company) yet becau&s;e that would not do, a while after you may read how dear <HI>Lot</HI> paid for dwelling in <HI>Sodom.</HI> Poor Man! he lo&s;t all that he had, and was fain to fly away without either Flocks or Herds, and little more than his Clothes on his Back; and that which was more &s;ad, to leave &s;ome of his own dear Relations behind him, roa&s;ting in tho&s;e di&s;mal Flames. Whereas, had he never come to <HI>Sodom,</HI> or upon the Sight of their Wickedne&s;s &s;peedily left them, it had been much better with him in many Re&s;pects. <HI>Jeho|&s;aphat</HI> fared never the better for joining in Affini|ty with his wicked Neighbours, it had like to have
<PB N="352" REF="395">co&s;t him his Life. But were it only Lo&s;s of Tem|porals that a Man hazarded by &s;uch Society, the Danger were not &s;o con&s;iderable, but the Peril is greater than &s;o, for by it they make God &s;tand at a Di&s;tance; they mu&s;t never look to have &s;uch Company and God's Company both together; I mean, when they do unnece&s;&s;arily or delightfully conver&s;e with &s;uch. If therefore you intend to be acquainted with God, you mu&s;t not have them always in your Company whom he hates, and which hate him, and will labour all they can to cool your Affections towards him. Wherefore, be ye not unequally yoaked with Unbelievers: for what Fellow&s;hip hath Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s with Righteou&s;ne&s;s? and what Communion hath Light with Darkne&s;s? and what Concord hath Chri&s;t with <HI>Belial?</HI> or what Part hath he that believeth with an Infidel? and what Agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? for ye are the Tem|ple of the living God, as God hath &s;aid, <HI>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they &s;hall be my People; wherefore come out from among them, and be ye &s;eparate, &s;aith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will re|ceive you, and I will be a Father unto you, and ye &s;hall be my Sons and Daughters, &s;aith the Lord Al|mighty,</HI> 2 Cor. 6.14. to the End. But I would not here be mi&s;taken, as if I would commend an ungodly proud&punc; Separation from all that are not ju&s;t of our Mind; or as if a Man ought to have nothing at all to do with wicked Men; no, no, every one ought to do what he can in his Place for the good of Souls. O that Chri&s;tians would thus conver&s;e more with their poor, ignorant, carnal, Chri&s;tle&s;s Neighbours! O that they would
<PB N="353" REF="396">thus be more acquainted with the Wicked, and then they &s;hould have never the le&s;s of God's Com|pany, but the more; but it is an unnece&s;&s;ary de|lightful a&s;&s;ociating of our &s;elves with them that I mean, e&s;pecially &s;uch of them which will &s;tifle e|very &s;piritual Di&s;cour&s;e, and divert you from a|ny thing that tends to the promoting of the In|tere&s;t of Religion; and &s;uch as have frequently expre&s;&s;ed their Dete&s;tation of the way of Holi|line&s;s, and make but a Mock at your &s;erious Coun&s;els, &s;top their Ears to whol&s;ome Advice, or make &s;ome undecent Reflections upon the &s;trict Profe&s;&s;ion of Godline&s;s; &s;uch as labour to make you believe that all Religion, but that which will con&s;i&s;t with their Wickedne&s;s, is but a Fancy. As for &s;uch as tho&s;e, abhor their Company, fly from them as tho&s;e that have the Plague, the Marks of Death are upon them, and you may write, <HI>Lord have Mercy upon us</HI> upon their Doors, but go not in le&s;t you be infected.</P>
<P N="5">5. If you would be acquainted with God, take heed of Unbelief. Unbelief will make your Soul depart from God, and God quite to depart from your Soul. This, this is one of tho&s;e dreadful and God-e&s;tranging Sins, which leads on whole Legi|ons again&s;t the Almighty. This is that bold da|ring Sin, which gives Truth it &s;elf the Lye, and &s;aith, That the Word of God is fal&s;e, his Pro|mi&s;es airy, his Threatnings but a Wind: But know this, O Sinner, &s;uch a Wind they be, that will ri&s;e to a dreadful Storm, and turn your &s;trong Confidences up by the Roots, and blow them into Hell, if you make no more of them than you do.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="354" REF="397">6. If you would be acquainted with God, be|ware of Sen&s;uality. To be &s;en&s;ual and devili&s;h are near akin. To be Lovers of Plea&s;ures and Haters of God, are u&s;ually Concomitants; in a world, to fare deliciou&s;ly every Day, and to be de&s;pi&s;ed of God, are no &s;trange things. But I wave the fur|ther Pro&s;ecution of the&s;e things, becau&s;e they are &s;o largely and excellently handled already by &s;o many of our brave Worthies. See Mr. <HI>Baxter's Saints Re&s;t,</HI> and <HI>R. A.</HI> his <HI>Vindiciae Pietatis.</HI></P>

<P>If you would be acquainted with God, re&s;ol|vedly and freely give up your &s;elf to him, and enter into a mo&s;t &s;olemn Covenant with him. And here I &s;hall make bold with that Reverend Author which <HI>R. A.</HI> doth mention in his <HI>Vindi|ciae Pietatis,</HI> and pre&s;ent you again with that ex|cellent Form with the Preparatories to it, which I have lately met with in the forementioned Au|thor. After your mo&s;t &s;erious Addre&s;&s;es to God, and after a deliberate Con&s;ideration of the Terms of this Covenant; and after a thorow &s;earch of your own Heart, whether you either have alrea|dy, or can now freely make &s;uch a Clo&s;ure with God in Chri&s;t, as you have been exhorted to: and when you have compo&s;ed your Spirits into the mo&s;t &s;erious Frame po&s;&s;ible, &s;uitable to a Tran&s;action of &s;o high a Nature, lay hold upon the Covenant, and rely upon his Promi&s;e of gi|ving Grace and Strength, whereby you may be enabled to perform your Promi&s;e.

<P><HI>O mo&s;t dreadful God; for the Pa&s;&s;ion of thy Son, I be&s;eech thee to accept of thy poor Prodigal, now pro|&s;trating him&s;elf at thy Door; I have fallen from thee by mine Iniquity, and am by Nature a Son of Death, and a thou&s;and-fold more the Child of Hell by my wicked Practice; but of thine infinite Grace thou ha&s;t promi&s;ed Mercy to me in Chri&s;t, if I will but turn to thee with all my Heart: Therefore upon the Call of the Go&s;pel I am now come in, and throwing down my Weapons, &s;ubmit my &s;elf to thy Mercy. And becau&s;e thou require&s;t, as the Condition of my Peace with thee, that I &s;hould put away mine Idols, and be at Defi|ance with all thine Enemies, which I acknowledge I have wickedly &s;ided with again&s;t thee; I do here from the Bottom of my Heart renounce them all, freely co|venanting with thee, not to allow my &s;elf in any known Sin, but con&s;cientiou&s;ly to u&s;e all the Means that I know thou ha&s;t pre&s;cribed for the Death and ut|ter De&s;truction of all my Corruptions; and whereas I have formerly inordinately and idolatrou&s;ly let out my Affections upon the World, I do here re&s;ign my Heart to thee that made&s;t it; humbly prote&s;ting before thy glorious Maje&s;ty, that it is the firm Re&s;olution of my Heart, and that I do unfeignedly de&s;ire Grace from thee, that when thou &s;halt call me hereunto, I may practice this my Re&s;olution, through thy A&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="356" REF="399">to for&s;ake all that is dear unto me in this World, rather than to turn from thee to the ways of Sin; and that I will watch again&s;t all its Temptati|ons, whether of Pro&s;perity or Adver&s;ity, le&s;t they &s;hould withdraw my Heart from thee; be&s;eeching thee al&s;o to help me again&s;t the Temptations of Satan, to who&s;e Sugge&s;tions, I re&s;olve, by thy Grace, never to yield my &s;elf a Servant.

<P><HI>O ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, I come to thee hungry and hardly be&s;tead, poor, and wretched, and mi&s;erable, and blind, and naked, a mo&s;t loath&s;ome polluted Wretch, a guilty condemned Malefactor, unworthy for ever to wa&s;h the Feet of the Servants of my Lord, much more

I have told you what the Lord doth require of them that would be in Co|venant with him. I have given you a rude De|&s;cription of him whom I would have you ac|quainted with. I have told you of &s;ome of the glorious Effects of Acquaintance with God. I have told you of the Danger of being a Stranger to God. I have told you how thankfully &s;ome have clo&s;ed with the&s;e Offers, and how well they like their Choice. I have further &s;howed you what a peaceable State you &s;hall be in, immedi|ately upon your Spiritual Alliance with this great and noble Friend. I have told you al&s;o of &s;ome further Benefit and Good that will come unto you upon your Acquaintance with God.

I have again and again propounded this Match to you, and told you as much as I could well do in &s;o &s;hort a time, I have &s;taid a great while for an An&s;wer.

<PB N="361" REF="404">kindly entertain, and make much of any Me&s;&s;en|gers that come from him to you; and if Men would make &s;ure Work, I de&s;ired them as they loved their Souls, that they would follow this great Bu&s;ine&s;s with the greate&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s and Seriou&s;ne&s;s in the World; and that, what they do, they would do &s;peedily. I informed you what Arguments the Scripture puts into our Mouths, which we may urge at the Throne of Grace. I intreated you for your Soul's &s;ake to take heed of tho&s;e things which kept God and Man unacquainted; as namely, all Sin in general, but more particularly, Pride, Worldly-minded|ne&s;s, Hypocri&s;y, delight in wicked Company, Unbelief, and Sen&s;uality. La&s;tly, I direct all &s;uch as would be at Peace with God to give up them&s;elves to him re&s;olvedly and freely, in a &s;o|lemn Covenant.</P>
<P>And have I been beating the Air all this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ile? What will you do after all this? What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be|come of all the&s;e Sermons? Dare any of you all &s;till be contented to be unacquainted with God? Can you be very well &s;atisfied, after you have heard of &s;uch a Friend, to be a Stranger to him? Can any of you look upon your State as &s;afe, while God is your Enemy? O how &s;hall I leave you, with Hearts full of Enmity again&s;t your Maker! Alas, alas, poor Hearts! You look very merrily, as bad a Condition as you are in, but did you but know how near you are to everla&s;ting Burnings, I believe it would put a Damp upon your Spirits, and &s;poil your Mirth. O how &s;hall I leave that poor Sinner, that &s;tands as a Per&s;on altogether unconcerned! Whereas Death &s;tands ready for his Commi&s;&s;ion, to fetch him away be|fore
<PB N="362" REF="405">God; and where are you then? O where are you then, if you come before God as a Stran|ger? O what &s;hall I do for thee? What &s;hall I &s;ay to thee, to prevail with thee! O what Ar|guments will per&s;wade thee! O how &s;hall we part! Brethren, my Heart's De&s;ire is that you may all be &s;aved. O that you may all know in this your Day, the things of your Peace! O that I could mingle all my Words with Tears! O pi|ty, pity, for the Lord's &s;ake, pity your precious Souls! O come not here to ask Coun&s;el of God, and then go away, and take the Coun&s;el of the Devil! And what will you yet make light of all the Tenders of the Go&s;pel? Is Peace, Pardon, Reconciliation, and Acquaintance with God, &s;till nothing with you? Will you for all this take up with a lifele&s;s Religion, and never mind a more &s;piritual intimate Conver&s;e with God? As the Lord liveth, thou &s;peake&s;t that Word again&s;t the Life of thy Soul. But if thou wilt go on, and de|&s;pi&s;e God, who can help it? I have told you, and told you again, what the End of the&s;e things will be. Well once more I ask thee in the Name of God, wilt thou have God for thy Friend or no? That is, wilt thou love him above all the World? Wilt thou accept him for thy Lord and Husband? Wilt thou be ruled ab&s;olutely by him? Wilt thou lay down thy Weapons, and turn on God's &s;ide, and fight under his Banner? Wilt thou have Ho|line&s;s here, and Happine&s;s hereafter? One would think, this is a Que&s;tion that one need not be long a re&s;olving. Come, come away, for the Lord's &s;ake; for your precious Soul's &s;ake, as you would be owned at the Day of Judgment; as you would rejoice when mo&s;t of the World &s;hall be
<PB N="363" REF="406">filled with un&s;peakable Horror, and Perplexity; as you would not hear that Heart-rending Word from the Mouth of the Judge, <HI>Depart, I know you not,</HI> come away, I be&s;eech you! Come away! O ye my dear Friends, the Cloud hangs over the World, and e're long it will fall with a Vengeance. O come out of <HI>Sodom,</HI> linger not for the Lord's &s;ake, le&s;t the Dint of that Storm fall upon you. Fire! Fire! Fire! Awake! Awake! Awake! The Fire is kindled. What meane&s;t thou, O Sin|ner! If thou &s;leepe&s;t a little longer in that Bed of Security, thou art a dead Man, thou wilt be awakened with Horror, when thou &s;halt know thy Danger, but not know how to avoid it. And do you &s;till &s;tay? Make ha&s;t! O make ha&s;t, your Gla&s;s is almo&s;t out, your time almo&s;t &s;pent, and Death is ha&s;tning apace upon you; I &s;peak it a|gain, make ha&s;t, come away, I can't, I can't hold my Peace. How can I indure to &s;ee the Ru|in of thy Soul, and &s;ay nothing! O follow tho&s;e Directions which I have given thee out of the Scripture! Seek the Lord while he may be found, and with all po&s;&s;ible Speed, Seriou&s;ne&s;s, and Gratitude, accept of his Kindne&s;s, while you may. Methinks &s;ome of your Hearts &s;eem to be affected; methinks your Countenances &s;peak you to have &s;ome Thoughts of returning; &s;ome of you look like Per&s;ons almo&s;t re&s;olved to &s;et upon this great Work. O that it may not be almo&s;t, but altogether! Speak in &s;uch Language as this to your own Souls. What meane&s;t thou, O my Soul, thus to &s;tand di&s;puting? Is this a time for thee to &s;tand &s;till, as if thou had&s;t nothing to do? Hark, how the King of Glory calls! Hear how his Me&s;&s;engers invite you! Con&s;ider how
<PB N="364" REF="407">long they have &s;tood waiting for thee! And &s;hall they go away without thee? O fooli&s;h Heart and unwi&s;e; wilt thou an&s;wer all the&s;e gracious Offers with a flat Denial? Or that which is little better, wilt thou put off all God's Me&s;&s;engers with &s;ome &s;orry Excu&s;es? Awake, O my Soul, and look about thee! How can&s;t thou refu&s;e when Mercy calls? How can&s;t thou deny when Kindne&s;s it &s;elf asks, intreats, be&s;eecheth thee? Awake for &s;hame, up and put on thy wedding-Garments, O that this Mind might be in you al|ways! O that thou wert up and ready! And then happy were the Day wherein thou wert born; then happy were the Day that ever you heard of a Chri&s;t, of Acquaintance with God, and Reconciliation with your Maker. O then how glorious &s;houlde&s;t thou be for ever! I re|joice to &s;ee the Day of thy Marriage a coming; when thy Lord and Husband &s;hall bring thee home in the greate&s;t State, and in infinite Glory to his own Hou&s;e, where thou &s;halt &s;it like a Queen for ever and ever. Behold his Harbin|gers are coming! Behold how many Me&s;&s;engers the Lord hath &s;ent to prepare his Way! Awake, O <HI>Zion,</HI> and put on thy beautiful Garments! Ri&s;e up, O Royal Bride, and put on thy prince|ly Robes! Clothe thee with the Son, and put the Moon under thy Feet. Go out and meet the King thy Husband. Behold, O <HI>Jacob,</HI> the Wag|gons of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> are coming! Behold, O Daughter of <HI>Zion,</HI> the Chariots, the Chariots of thy King and Husband are a coming! they are a coming! O why doth not thy Heart leap within thee! O why do not thy Spirits even faint for Gladne&s;s! Why do&s;t thou not &s;ay it is enough, I will go out
<PB N="365" REF="408">and meet my Lord before I die? When will the Sun be up! When will the Day break! When, O when will the Shadows fly away! I will get me up to the Mountains of Mirrhe, to the Hills of Frankincen&s;e. I am travelling for <HI>Zion,</HI> my Face is towards <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> who will a&s;cend the Holy Hill with me? Who will bare me Company to my Husband's Hou&s;e? Let us go up to the Lord's Hou&s;e; come away, the Sun is ri&s;en, the Shadows are flying away; thou&s;ands are gone al|ready. Let <HI>Barzillai</HI> and <HI>Chimham,</HI> old and young too, go along with the King to <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Come from the High-ways and Hedges, come with your wedding-Garments, come quickly and he will make you welcome. The King hath &s;ent to invite us to a Fea&s;t, a Fea&s;t of fat things, of Wines on the Lees well re&s;ined. Come, for the Table is &s;pread, all things are ready, and his Servants &s;tay for us. And will God enter|tain &s;uch Creatures as we are! And will the Lord open his Doors to &s;uch loath&s;ome Beggars? Will the Father receive &s;uch Prodigals! Return then unto thy Re&s;t, O my Soul, for the Lord will deal bountifully with thee. Who is that which I &s;ee coming in the Field? Who is this that comes from the Wilderne&s;s? that comes to meet us? Hark! Methinks I hear the Trumpet &s;oun|ding: Hark! What's the matter! How do the Mountains eccho! How doth the Air ring again! What Noi&s;e is that which I hear! What glorious Train is that which I &s;ee! Whence do they come, and whither do they go? It is my Ma&s;ter's Son (dear Soul) thy Lord and Husband with his Royal Attendants. Behold he comes! He comes apace! Leaping upon the Hills, skip|ping
<PB N="366" REF="409">upon the Mountains. He is coming! he is coming! he is even at the Door! E're long thou &s;halt &s;ee the Mountains covered with Cha|riots and Hor&s;es of Fire; the Earth will tremble and &s;hake; the Heavens and the Earth will be all on a flaming Fire; the King of Glory will come, riding upon the Wings of the Wind, accompa|nied with Millions of his Saints and Angels: He is coming, he is at the Door. Go vail thy Face; alight and meet thy Husband. He will bring thee into his Father's Palace, and thou &s;halt be his Wife, and he will love thee for ever: and thou &s;halt re|member thy Widowhood no more. <HI>Even &s;o, come Lord Je&s;us, come quickly,</HI> Amen.
