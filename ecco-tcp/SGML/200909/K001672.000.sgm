<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>17 Oct. 1782.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU a&s;k me by what means it comes to pa&s;s that a rude poetical production of a barbarous age always affects, and plea&s;es, the heart more than the mo&s;t fini&s;hed and artificial effort of a refined compo&s;er?</P>
<P>TO examine this matter thoroughly might employ much philo&s;ophical re&s;earch. I &s;hall only beg leave to lay before you a few remarks, which may not perhaps have offered them&s;elves to your enquiries.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="8">IN the fir&s;t place, what do you call a barba|rous age, or country? To what period of &s;ociety may this denomination be properly limited? The Greeks gave this denomination to the Per&s;ians; tho the latter were arrived at more refinement of manners than them&s;elves. We give it to the Chine&s;e: the Chine&s;e with equal propriety to us.</P>
<P>BARBARISM, like every other human acci|dent and quality, mu&s;t be allowed to be merely comparative. If any one &s;aid that mo&s;t of the European kingdoms had not yet emerged from barbarity, nay, that the mo&s;t poli&s;hed of them are yet but barbarcus, every beau of the aera of George I. would &s;troke his chin and &s;mile. Yet were all ancient Roman to revi&s;it this globe, and make a tour to Paris, I have no doubt but he would with great ju&s;tice affirm that the French were very little improved &s;ince his own days; that their cu&s;toms, their dre&s;s, their luxuries, were barbarous <HI>au dernier point.</HI> I &s;ay with ju&s;tice, becau&s;e, from a comparative view of the Roman manners, every one mu&s;t allow that they were, in the days of their glory, as much &s;uperior to the French in luxury, which
<PB N="3" REF="9">is always con&s;idered as the great criterion of refinement, as the French are to the E&s;quimaux Indians, Indeed, one cannot help &s;miling when the declamations of writers, and of the clergy in particular, again&s;t the luxury and refinement of their own &s;everal ages, are con&s;idered. In the old Engli&s;h days, when the drawing-rooms of palaces were carpeted with clean &s;traw, and maids of honour breakfa&s;ted on roa&s;t beef, the pulpits &s;hook with virulent invectives again&s;t pride of furniture, and delicacy of food. What more can be &s;aid now, when fore&s;ts are robbed of their mu&s;ic for the &s;ake of the rumps of the nightingales? What more will be &s;aid, four centuries after this, when, I will venture to prophe&s;y, luxury and refinement will be in &s;uch a &s;tate as ju&s;tly to reflect upon this age the appellation of barbarous?</P>
<P>THESE remarks are only made with a view to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of defining what is meant by barbaric poetry before the &s;ubject is further opened. To the poetry of the modern French, ju&s;t as the above ob&s;ervations may be, we &s;hould no more think of giving the epithet of barba|rous, than to that of the ancient Greeks or Romans.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="10">As in youth mo&s;t people have felt an incli|nation to write ver&s;es, tho in a more mature age they have lo&s;t that de&s;ire; &s;o it is in the youth of &s;ociety, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, that poetry has mo&s;t flouri&s;hed. Now this youth of &s;ociety is commonly, like that of man, lo&s;t in tempe&s;tuous pa&s;&s;ions, which call forth extraordinary exertions of mind. Such exertions form the very life and &s;oul of poetry. Homer was a witne&s;s of &s;uch emotions as ari&s;e in a barbarous &s;tate of &s;ociety, ere he recorded them in the Iliad. Violent actions, and &s;udden calamities of all kinds, are the certain conco|mitants of uncivilized life: to the&s;e we owe a poetry warm, rapid, and impetuous, that, like a large river &s;welling from a bleak mountain, carries the reader along in the barge of fancy, now by vales fragrant with wild flowers, now thro woods re&s;ounding with untaught me|lody, but mo&s;t generally thro de&s;erts replete with romantic and with dreadful pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>SOCIETY always pa&s;&s;es through three differ|ent &s;tages ere it arrives at refinement. The fir&s;t is the mere &s;avage &s;tate, during which the lord of the world is almo&s;t on a level with the
<PB N="5" REF="11">brutes them&s;elves: living like them in caves, or wretched huts, in the woods that &s;aw him born, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on wild fruits, and &s;uch prey as his rude invention can &s;eize by force or guile. Climate has &s;uch power over human happine&s;s as &s;ometimes to fix Society in this &s;tate without any hope of further progre&s;s: as for in&s;tance, in Lapland. The poetry of &s;uch a country mu&s;t of cour&s;e be always barbaric. The &s;econd &s;tage is that of pa&s;toral life. The third may be con&s;idered as a kind of middle &s;tate between barbari&s;m and civilization; and is that in which the &s;hepherds of the &s;econd &s;tate begin to confederate together, for defence of them&s;elves and their flocks, again&s;t &s;uch of their neighbours as are yet in the fir&s;t condi|tion, and who, ignorant of property, would admit of no law but force. For that effect towns are built, and, by the colli&s;ion of differ|ent minds, the arts and &s;ciences begin to be &s;truck out, which are in time to &s;pread the light of refinement thro the community.</P>
<P>ALL poetry compo&s;ed in the&s;e different pe|riods of &s;ociety may with propriety be termed barbaric; but more particulary that of the fir&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="12">and &s;econd. The Iliad, if not written during the third, is yet a living picture of its manners: and it is to this, as much as to any other cir|cum&s;tance, that it owes its wonderful &s;uperio|rity. For no &s;tate of &s;ociety can be &s;o intere&s;t|ing as that in which the &s;un of &s;cience is be|ginning to ri&s;e, and di&s;cover pro&s;pects full of &s;plendor and novelty; and in which the mind, vegetating &s;trongly, begins from a vigorous &s;tem to di&s;play the buds of elegance.</P>
<P>AS in this &s;tage of &s;ociety poetry may be carried to the highe&s;t perfection, &s;o the two fir&s;t do not impede its real influence: for what it wants in art, in elegance, in harmony, is fully compen&s;ated by a wild force of nature, by a &s;implicity, by a pathos to which every heart is in uni&s;on; attributes no le&s;s declarative of the power of poetry than the former. Love, a pa&s;&s;ion of every age and climate, imparts his tenderne&s;s even to the &s;avage brea&s;t amid the &s;nows of Lapland, as we may perceive from the &s;ongs pre&s;erved by Scheffer, which you &s;o much admire; and which may be compared to the ro&s;es that grow wild, as Mr. Maupertuis informs us, on the banks of the rivers and lakes of that dreary country.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="13">FROM what I have written, you will no doubt &s;ee that I am &s;till the &s;ame &s;ceptic in mo&s;t matters that you left me; thinking al|ways, ways, with Sir Roger de Coverley, that "much may be &s;aid on both &s;ides:" &s;o that, if you wi&s;h to have an opinion on any &s;ubject, you will be much di&s;appointed if you apply to me; but, if you de&s;ire to hear doubts in&s;tead of deci&s;ions, I may perhaps furni&s;h you with a &s;ufficiency.</P>
<P>AS I know your fondne&s;s for &s;uch pieces of rude poetry as have intrin&s;ic merit, I &s;ubjoin two that may not perhaps have lain in your way.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is extracted from a Hi&s;tory of the Canary I&s;lands by Captain Glas; and is one of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite pieces of elegiac poetry which I have ever met with. In the year 1418, you mu&s;t know, Guillen Peraza, an enterprizing youth, was Governor of the Canary I&s;lands; but attempting to reduce Palma, one of them, to the power of Spain, he was there killed. The following ver&s;es were made on that occa|&s;ion, and, as our author informs us, are re|peated
<PB N="8" REF="14">in Palma to this day: which I do not wonder at, as every one who hears them mu&s;t wi&s;h to remember them; and the heart mu&s;t be hard indeed, that is not affected by their deep pathos. There is a bit of a pun however in the &s;econd &s;tanza, which to under&s;tand you mu&s;t remember that Palma &s;ignifies a palm-tree. As perhaps, to u&s;e a royal metaphor, your Spani&s;h may be ru&s;ty, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin a pro&s;e tran&s;lation as literal as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<Q>I was walking thro the &s;hade of the grove in the morning dew. I met my fancy. She talked with her &s;miling lips to me. I gave her no an&s;wer. She told me to &s;peak out my mind.

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>INdifference for fame is by no means to be regarded as a virtue. If de&s;ire of prai&s;e be a vice, it is a vice that is the author of many virtues; and we are glad to have rich grain, tho we u&s;e dung to produce it.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time I perfectly agree with you that common and univer&s;al applau&s;e is in the eyes of a man of wi&s;dom, or even of true ta&s;te, a matter not to be wi&s;hed. The prai&s;e of one fool or knave we &s;hould be a&s;hamed of; &s;urely then we ought infinitely more to de&s;pi&s;e that of an innumerable multitude of both. If a man has vanity, his vanity it&s;elf ought to be rather offended than plea&s;ed at the incen&s;e ari&s;|ing from the flowers of &s;uch weeds: even his vanity &s;hould have a better ta&s;te, as Mr. Gray expresses it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="20">'Prai&s;e,' &s;ays Lord Bacon, <Q>is the reflection of virtue: but it is as the gla&s;s, or body, which giveth the reflection. If it be from the common people, it is commonly fal&s;e and naught; and rather followeth vain per&s;ons than virtuous. For the common people un|der&s;tand not many excellent virtues: the lowe&s;t virtues draw prai&s;e from them; the middle virtues excite in them a&s;toni&s;hment or admiration; but of the highe&s;t virtues they have no &s;en&s;e or perceiving at all; but &s;hews, and <HI>&s;pecies virtutibus &s;imiles,</HI> &s;erve be&s;t with them. Certainly fame is like a river, that beareth up things light and &s;wollen, and drowns things weighty and &s;olid: but, if per|&s;ons of quality and judgement concur, then it is (as the Scripture &s;aith) <HI>Nomen bonum in&s;tar unguenti fragrantis.</HI> It filleth all round about, and will not ea&s;ily away: for the odours of ointments are more durable than tho&s;e of flowers.</Q></P>
<P>So far this excellent writer, upon who&s;e e&s;timate of fame &s;ome ill-natured reader may perhaps make this cen&s;ure, that, if Lord Bacon had held popular applau&s;e in more reverence,
<PB N="13" REF="21">he might have had at lea&s;t one &s;trong motive not to degrade his high office by the acceptance of a bribe. It may however be remarked upon the above quotation, with more ju&s;tice, that by <HI>per&s;ons of quality</HI> the great chancellor mu&s;t mean per&s;ons who&s;e quality lies in their mind; not our mob of per&s;ons of quality, who are mo&s;t commonly, if you will excu&s;e a pun, per&s;ons of no quality at all.</P>
<P>INDIFFERENCE for vulgar fame therefore you will do well to di&s;criminate from indiffe|rence for genuine prai&s;e of the true flavour. The former certainly belongs to a mind that can &s;tand upon its own ba&s;is without the props of adventitious opinions. The latter, I will be bold to &s;ay, is the parent of every vice. <HI>What will the world &s;ay?</HI> is a reflection that has &s;tifled many a bad inclination in the brea&s;ts of tho&s;e who are either above, or below, every other motive. Want of &s;hame, and total pro|fligacy, follow like a flood if you remove this bank, which excluded them. It is true, this principle has done as much harm as good in the world; a fal&s;e re&s;pect for the opinion of others having de&s;troyed many a virtue, becau&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="22">it did not happen at that time to float upon the &s;tream of fa&s;hion. Such effect has fal&s;e fame upon a little mind: and the force of the true upon a large &s;oul is yet more &s;trong.

<P>AN author in particular, who has any regard for his fame, &s;hould beware of building it upon &s;uch a &s;andy foundation as the applau&s;e of the mob. The popular gale, as Horace phra&s;es it, is eternally veering: but in no clime does it
<PB N="15" REF="23">vary more than in that of literature. Fa&s;hion, after exerting her power upon mo&s;t other &s;ub|jects, has at la&s;t cho&s;en literary reputation to di&s;play the utmo&s;t caprices of her &s;way. Sometimes it happens wonderfully that &s;he blunders right; but mo&s;t commonly her fa|vours are unworthily be&s;towed. The&s;e fa&s;hi|onable &s;criblers, who are now &s;o common, are however by no means to be envied, for, in the cour&s;e of a year, of a month, of a day, the public may &s;ee the deception; and, as it hap|pens when we treat a &s;tranger with re&s;pect who, we afterwards find, de&s;erves our &s;corn, their warme&s;t admirers mo&s;t frequently revenge the in&s;ult, they have them&s;elves impo&s;ed on their own under&s;tandings, by commencing their bittere&s;t enemies.</P>
<P>THERE is a grievance ju&s;t now reigning in this capital, of which you in the country can &s;carcely have an idea. After being ble&s;t with a variety of &s;windlers in all occupations, we have at la&s;t got <HI>literary &s;windlers:</HI> people who &s;teal reputation in order to &s;teal money. As the character mu&s;t be new to you, I will give you &s;ome outlines of it.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="24">A LITERARY &s;windler is a &s;cribler who regards fame as only a road to the temple of wealth; of con&s;equence, &s;o he can get what is here called reputation, he cares not by what means. His fir&s;t &s;tep is to form an intimacy with the printers of new&s;papers, of magazines, of reviews, and other periodical works. Thro the&s;e channels he gravely communicates to the public what are here emphatically deno|minated <HI>puffs,</HI> or prai&s;es of him&s;elf and his writings, the more bomba&s;tic the better. Tho&s;e who know the trick laugh at his effrontery: but as they are but few, in compari&s;on of the others, he minds not their deri&s;ion. The mob, who know nothing of the matter, &s;tare, and wonder they have not heard of &s;uch a cele|brated writer. Every one, not to appear igno|rant, whether he has read the work <HI>puffed,</HI> or not, calls it admirable; tho, were he to tru&s;t his own judgement, he would call it the &s;illie&s;t non&s;en&s;e that ever fell from a goo&s;e's quill. The &s;cribler in the mean time goes on <HI>puffing</HI> as fa&s;t as he can; writes anecdotes of him&s;elf; &s;ends letters from the country telling of his being &s;o happy as to be in the company of him&s;elf, and what a mode&s;t and wonderful
<PB N="17" REF="25">man he him&s;elf is. At length by the&s;e, and &s;uch tricks, he gets what is called a reputation; and perhaps makes a fortune by it, ere the knavery is revealed.</P>
<P>No con&s;ideration can make a man of reflec|tion more deaf to popular approbation, than the view of &s;uch a charmer as the above. He will perceive that the fame he pur&s;ued, as a cha&s;te bride, is no better than a common pro&s;|titute; and abandon the &s;uit with &s;corn and indignation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>HAD you peru&s;ed the work of Vava&s;&s;or, you would cea&s;e to wonder at your friend's taking no notice of him in his E&s;&s;ay on Ludicrous Compo&s;ition. His book <HI>De Dic|tione Ludicra,</HI> which you think mu&s;t abound with curious matter, is the mo&s;t vapid perfor|mance you can imagine. You likeways mi&s;|take its intention. It is written to prove that the ancients either knew nothing of, or el&s;e de&s;pi&s;ed, ludicrous writing; and what do you think is the con&s;equence he derives from this di&s;covery which his half-learning enabled him to make? Why to be &s;ure that we, the poor moderns, mu&s;t not pretend to fea&s;t on more luxurious things than our elders; and mu&s;t look on a way of writing, unknown to them, as forbidden to us. <HI>Ah lepidum caput!</HI> His book <HI>De Epigrammate</HI> is of the fame &s;tuff. The one half of it is filled with invectives, truly je&s;uiti|cal, again&s;t &s;ome Collector of Epigrams, be|cau&s;e, as would appear, he did not think any
<PB N="19" REF="27">of Vava&s;&s;or's Epigrams worthy a place in his work. However, he afterwards gives his an|tagoni&s;t ample revenge, by pre&s;enting us with his own epigrams, in three books; among all which there is not one that will bear reading twice, or indeed once if one could judge of them at fir&s;t &s;ight.</P>
<P>Such are the works of Vava&s;&s;or, who has written on &s;ubjects of elegance without ta&s;te, and on &s;ubjects of curio&s;ity without intere&s;ting, nay, I may add, on &s;ubjects of erudition with|out learning.</P>
<P>WHAT mu&s;t we think of an author who&s;e works, in&s;tead of advancing knowlege, would confine it? who&s;e arguments, if extended, prove, that we mu&s;t not u&s;e gun-powder becau&s;e unknown at the battle of Marathon; nor printing, becau&s;e Cicero does not mention it?</P>
<P>YET &s;uch a writer has had his admirers among his countrymen; for, according to one of their own prophets,</P>
<Q>Un &s;ot trouve toujours un plus &s;ot qui l'admire.</Q>
<P><PB N="20" REF="28">I ENTIRELY agree with you, that Bo&s;&s;u, and the other French critics, whom Addi&s;on fol|lowed with blind adoration, cannot be held in too &s;overeign contempt. How mi&s;taken a cri|tic that fine writer was, may merit di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on another occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>AS I know that Aken&s;ide's work on the Plea&s;ures of Imagination is de&s;ervedly one of your mo&s;t favorite poems, I &s;end you inclo&s;ed what, I have no doubt, you will &s;et a due value on; no le&s;s than a copy of all the corrections he made with his own hand on that Poem. They were in&s;erted in the margin of the Doctor's printed copy, which afterwards pa&s;&s;ed into the hands of a gentleman, from a friend of whom, and of my own, a very inge|nious young Templar, I received them. At what time they were written I cannot pretend to &s;ay, much le&s;s to reveal the author's rea&s;ons for not giving an edition according to them. Mo&s;t of them are evidently much for the better; one or two, I am afraid, for the wor&s;e. You will ob&s;erve that a few of them have been adopted by the author in his propo&s;ed alteration of the Poem; as appears from the two books, and part of the third, of that alteration, publi&s;hed by Mr. Dy&s;on in his edition of Aken&s;ide's
<PB N="22" REF="30">Poems, 1772, 4to. but far the greater part is unpubli&s;hed; and that the mot valuable, as being evidently written ere the author had taken up the &s;trange idea that poetry was only perfect oratory. So that I will venture to &s;ay, that an edition of The Plea&s;ures of Imagina|tion, adopting mo&s;t of the&s;e corrections, would be the mo&s;t perfect ever yet known. Read and judge.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<P>IT is no incurious &s;ubject to enquire, what is the &s;pirit of lyric poetry? Or, in what does its di&s;crimination from other kinds of poetry con&s;i&s;t? Tho&s;e who have even pretended to write in this &s;tyle have often betrayed per|fect ignorance of the very principles of &s;o ex|qui&s;ite a mode of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE Greeks, the Greeks alone, my friend, are the ma&s;ters; and their works the models of this kind of poetry. If we examine the&s;e models with care, we &s;hall perceive that this &s;pecies of poetry divides it&s;elf, in re&s;emblance of the works of nature, into two kinds, the &s;ublime, and the beautiful. In the fir&s;t cla&s;s Pindar &s;tood without a rival till Gray appeared. In the &s;econd Anacreon and Sappho &s;till re|main without equal competitors.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="42">FROM the&s;e writers, therefore, the genuine &s;pirit of lyric poetry may be di&s;covered. From Pindar we learn that &s;udden tran&s;itions, bold and abrupt metaphors, a regular cadence, and a warm and impetuous glow of thought and language,
<Q>Thoughts that breathe, and words that burn,</Q>
are e&s;&s;entials of the higher mode of lyric writ|ing. I place a regular cadence among the&s;e requi&s;ites in &s;pire of Dryden's wonderful ode; which is of it&s;elf worth all that Pindar has written, as a large diamond is worth a va&s;t heap of gold, becau&s;e that ma&s;ter-piece is a dithyrambic poem, not a lyric one. And that as well for its want of regularity, as for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts &s;ubject, which, being perfectly convivial as its title &s;peaks, falls with much propriety into that cla&s;s which the ancients called dithyram|bic, and which were mo&s;t commonly &s;acred to Bacchus.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd divi&s;ion of lyric poetry the e&s;&s;entials are le&s;s ea&s;ily fixed. Harmony of cadence, and beauty and warmth of &s;entiment, pa&s;&s;ion, and expre&s;&s;ion, &s;eem the principal. Above all, uncommon elegance in turns of
<PB N="35" REF="43">language, and in tran&s;ition, are &s;o vital to this kind of lyric poetry in particular, that I will venture to &s;ay they con&s;titute its very &s;oul; a particular that none of our lyric writers, before Gray; at all attended to. His mode of expre&s;|&s;ion is truly lyrical; and has a cla&s;&s;ic brevity and ter&s;ene&s;s, formerly unknown in Engli&s;h, &s;ave to Milton alone. Of which to produce a few in&s;tances from his very fir&s;t Ode: <HI>purple year,</HI> for <HI>flowers of Spring: in&s;ect youth,</HI> for <HI>young in&s;ects: honied &s;pring,</HI> for <HI>honey of &s;pring: liquid noon,</HI> for <HI>liquid air of noon,</HI> with many others, are all modes of expre&s;&s;ion of the genuine and uncommon lyric hue.</P>
<P>HUME has well ob&s;erved, in his E&s;&s;ay on Simplicity and Re&s;inement, that <Q>no critici&s;m can be in&s;tructive which de&s;cends not to particulars, and is not full of examples and illu&s;trations.</Q> It may be added to this very ju&s;t remark, that the more minute critici&s;m is, the more need it has of example, to give a kind of body to its evane&s;cence. For this rea&s;on, &s;ince I have &s;poken of tran&s;ition as &s;o material a form of the ode, I &s;hall beg leave to con&s;ider a moment one of the be&s;t in any language with
<PB N="36" REF="44">regard to this beauty in particular, namely Dr. Beattie's Ode on Lord Hay's birth-day: a pro|duction which that &s;upreme judge of lyric poetry, Mr. Gray, prai&s;es with great ju&s;tice for the lyric texture of the thoughts.</P>
<P>THE opening of this fine piece is however unhappy. <HI>A Mu&s;e</HI> for <HI>a poet</HI> is a violent and bad metaphor. The Mu&s;e in any good modern writer only means <HI>Poe&s;y</HI> per&s;onified by another name. <HI>A Mu&s;e un&s;tained</HI> is wor&s;e. Un&s;tained is an inelegant epithet even when applied in its proper &s;en&s;e to garments, &amp;c. as it gives an idea that they might have been &s;tained. <HI>Un|&s;tained with art</HI> is a mixed metaphor, one of the wor&s;t faults of compo&s;ition: but, leaving tho&s;e painful remarks, the&s;e lines,
<Q><L>No gaudy wreath of flowers &s;he weaves,</L>
<L>But twines with oak the laurel leaves</L>
<L>Thy cradle to adorn,</L></Q>
are exqui&s;ite: the civic crown being of oak, the victor's of laurel. The image is beautiful to a degree of lyric perfection. But ob&s;erve the tran&s;ition to the next &s;tanza, and pro|nounce it truly lyric:
<Q><L>For not on beds of gaudy flowers</L>
<L>Thine ance&s;tors reclined, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<PB N="37" REF="45">This tran&s;ition in pro&s;e were ridiculous; for what connexion between not giving a child a wreath of flowers, and the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned, namely, becau&s;e his ance&s;tors did not recline on them? Yet this want of connexion forms the beauty of this very lyric tran&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE next 'To hurl the dart,' &amp;c. may be called a tran&s;ition <HI>from</HI> a di&s;tance as the la&s;t was <HI>to</HI> a di&s;tance. It is equally cla&s;&s;ic with the former.</P>
<P>IN the 4th &s;tanza the Mu&s;e is as happily introduced as &s;he was unhappily brought in at fir&s;t. It would require too much length to di&s;play the re&s;t of the tran&s;itions in this ode, which are all of them fine; but none more &s;o than that in this &s;tanza, 'Yon ca&s;tle's glitter|ing towers', &amp;c. which brings the very object before your eyes.</P>
<P>As &s;uch micro&s;copic parts of critici&s;m are rather fatiguing to the mental eye, I &s;hall here conclude with a&s;&s;uring you, tho perhaps with a lyric tran&s;ition in pro&s;e, that I am very truly, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>I AGREE with you that the life of the latter Cato would, if executed with a pen worthy of it, prove one of the noble&s;t pieces of biography extant: not to mention the public benefit that might be derived from it in the&s;e our evil days; days in which a remote found of the applau&s;e reaped by patriot virtue has hardly reached our ears.</P>
<P>OF all the great characters of antiquity, few equal, none exceed, that of Cato. The va&s;t|ne&s;s, the force of his mind, are only to be rivalled by its regular con&s;i&s;tency; a con&s;i&s;t|ency that makes all his a actions appear of a piece; a beauty, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, rarely to be ob&s;erved in the portraits of heroes; many of whom &s;eem to have fallen as &s;hort of common exertion in &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of their lives, as they exceeded it in others. How little, how mean, how trifling the character of Cicero when oppo&s;ed to &s;uch a model! The very fir&s;t &s;torm of public outrage tore his feeble
<PB N="39" REF="47">patrioti&s;m up by the roots; while the &s;trong virtue of Cato, like a mountain oak, received fre&s;h vigor from the utmo&s;t rage of the tem|pe&s;t.</P>
<P>THEY who peru&s;e the Familiar Letters of Cicero will find that orator, malapert and vari|ous as he is, uniform in his re&s;pect and almo&s;t adoration of Cato. Such was the power of real dignity of mind over fancy and loquacious eloquence! The&s;e letters are enriched by the pre&s;ervation of one of Cato, being the only compo&s;ition of his that has reached us; and which &s;hews us clearly that his &s;oul, &s;olid as diamond, was brightened with politene&s;s. Even friend&s;hip, that greate&s;t &s;nare of a lofty mind, could not influence him again&s;t the con&s;i&s;tent plan of his virtue; yet his refu&s;al to act again&s;t his real &s;entiments has nothing har&s;h, but is given at the &s;ame time with a firmne&s;s that leaves nothing to hope, and with a mildne&s;s that leaves nothing to cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>SPIRIT of Cato, what mu&s;t be thy indigna|tion if thou perceive&s;t the degeneracy of a country in which Hampden lied Ru&s;&s;el have bled!</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="48">IT is remarkable that three of the be&s;t Roman poets have, as it were, vied with each other, who &s;hould mo&s;t elevate the character of Cato. Virgil and Horace, tho the minions of a court who&s;e frame was cemented with the blood of that patriot, have almo&s;t excelled their common expre&s;&s;ion in his prai&s;e. The fir&s;t in the Eneid, where his hero finds Cato in Ely&s;ium giving laws to the good;
<Q>&mdash; His dantem jura Catonem.</Q>
The &s;econd in his odes;
<Q><L>Et cuncta terrarum &s;ubacta,</L>
<L>Praeter atrocem animum Catonis.</L></Q></P>
<P>But Lucan, above all, has ri&s;en to the actual &s;ublime, fired by the contemplation of that &s;ublime character,</P>
<Q>Victrix cau&s;a deis placuit: &s;ed vita Catoni.</Q>
<P>To which of the poets is the preeminence due? Virgil's prai&s;e is wonderfully fine at fir&s;t &s;ight; for how good, how ju&s;t, how virtuous, mu&s;t he be, who is qualified to give laws to the good, to the ju&s;t, to the virtuous, in Ely|&s;ium it&s;elf? But, like the other beauties of this writer, it will not bear a clo&s;e examination.
<PB N="41" REF="49">For what laws are to operate among the ble&s;|&s;ed, where there can be no puni&s;hment nor reward? How can they receive laws, who are emancipated from all po&s;&s;ibility of crime? The prai&s;e is therefore futile and ridiculous; nothing being more ab&s;urd than to erect a column of apparent &s;ublimity upon the mora&s;s of fal&s;e|hood.</P>
<P>THE prai&s;e of Horace has great truth and dignity. Every thing on earth, in &s;ubjection to Cae&s;ar &s;ave the mind of Cato, is a great, a va&s;t thought, and would even ari&s;e to the &s;ublime, were it not for that of Lucan, which exceeds it; and nothing can be &s;ublime to which a &s;uperior conception may be found.</P>
<P>THE prai&s;e of Lucan is &s;ublimity it&s;elf, for no human idea can go beyond it. Cato is &s;et in oppo&s;ition to the gods them&s;elves: nay is made &s;uperior in ju&s;tice, tho not in power. Now the power of the pagan deities may be called their extrin&s;ic, ju&s;tice their intrin&s;ic, vir|tue. Cato excelled them, &s;ays Lucan, in real virtue, tho their adventitious attribute of power admitted no rival.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR opinion of the comedy of Le Mechant I heartily &s;ub&s;cribe to, tho Mr. Gray has pronounced it the be&s;t comedy he ever read. It is perfectly in the &s;tyle of the French tragedy, inactive, and declamatory. Yet I do not wonder at Mr. Gray's favourable opinion of it, when he admired the &s;illy decla|mation of Racine &s;o much as to begin a tra|gedy in his very manner; which however he was &s;o fortunate as not to go thro with.</P>
<P>OUR &s;tage, thank heaven, refu&s;es the in&s;ipi|dity of the French drama; and requires an action, a bu&s;ine&s;s, a vigor, to which the run of Gerontes and Damons, which all their come|dies are, &s;tuffed with, are mere &s;trangers. Mo|liere, in attempting to introduce laughter into the French comedy, has blundered upon mere farce; for it is the character of that nation always to be in extremes. In &s;hort, if w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> except Fontaine, I know of no writer in the
<PB N="43" REF="51">French language who has real claim to poeti|cal merit. Their language is not the language of ver&s;e; nor are their thoughts, or their <HI>co&s;tume,</HI> tho&s;e of poetry. Fontaine u&s;es their language familiarly, in which way only it can be u&s;ed to advantage. His thoughts are like|wi&s;e in the &s;tyle of mere familiar humour. Comic tales may be well written in French, but nothing el&s;e. Their pro&s;e writers, I readily allow, yield to none in the world; but of their poetry the bon mot &s;aid by one of them&s;elves to Voltaire, which was, <HI>Les Fran&ccedil;ois n'ont pas la tete epique,</HI> may be with great ju&s;tice enlarged thus, LES FRANCcedil;OIS N'ONT PAS LA TETE POETIQUE.</P>
<P>IN Engli&s;h comedy Congreve, I believe, &s;tands without a rival. His plots have great depth and art; perhaps too much: his charac|ters are new and &s;trong: his wit genuine; and &s;o exuberant, that it has been alleged as his only fault, that he makes all his characters inherit his own wit. Yet this fault will not be imputed by adepts, who know that the dialogue of our comedy cannot po&s;&s;ibly be too &s;pirited and epigrammatic, for it requires lan|guage as well as characters &s;tronger than nature.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="52">SHAKSPERE excells in the &s;trength of his characters and in wit; but as plot mu&s;t be re|garded as an e&s;&s;ential of good comedy, he mu&s;t not be erected as a model in the comic acade|my; a lo&s;s &s;ufficiently compen&s;ated by the re|flection, that it were vain to place him as a model who&s;e beauties tran&s;cend all imitation.</P>
<P>TRAGEDY and Comedy both ought cer|tainly to approach as near the truth of life as po&s;&s;ible; in &s;o much that we may imagine we are placed with Le Diable Boiteux on the roof of the hou&s;e, and perceive what pa&s;&s;es within. This rule in Tragedy cannot be too &s;trictly ob&s;erved, tho it has e&s;caped almo&s;t every writer of modern Tragedy; the characters of which &s;peak &s;imilies, bomba&s;t, and every thing except the language of real life; &s;o that we are eter|nally tempted to exclaim, as Fal&s;taff does to Pi&s;tol, 'Pr'ythee &s;peak like a man of this world'.</P>
<P>In comedy this rule ought by no means to be adhered to; as in&s;ipidity is the wor&s;t fault writing can have, but particularly comedy; who&s;e chief quality it is to be poignant. Now poignancy cannot be effected without &s;trong character; but an excellent tragedy may be
<PB N="45" REF="53">written without a &s;trong character in it, witne&s;s Douglas. The characters of Tragedy therefore cannot have too much truth: but tho&s;e of Co|medy ought to re&s;emble the painted &s;cenes, which, if examined too nearly, are mere daub|ings; but at a proper di&s;tance have the very truth of nature, while the beauties of more delicate paintings would not be perceived.</P>
<P>SENTIMENTAL Comedy, as it is called, tho of late birth in England, is yet the comedy of Menander and of Terence. Terence is quite full of &s;entiment, and of a tenderne&s;s which accompanies it; and &s;o barren of wit and hu|mour, that I only remember two pa&s;&s;ages in its fix comedies that provoke a &s;mile; for a &s;mile is all they can provoke. The one is that &s;cene which pa&s;&s;es after the eunuch is &s;uppo&s;ed to have ravi&s;hed a young lady. This is the only proof of the humour of Terence: and the only &s;ample of his wit we have in the reply of an old mi&s;er to one who he expected brought him tidings of a legacy, but who in&s;tead thereof makes very gravely a moral ob&s;erva|tion to the impatient old man, who peevi&s;hly retorts, "What! ha&s;t thou brought nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here but one maxim?"</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="54">SENTIMENTAL Comedy bore a very &s;hort &s;way in England. Indeed it was incompatible with the humour of an Engli&s;h audience, who go to a comedy to laugh, and not to cry. It was even more ab&s;urd, it may be added, in its faults than that of which Congreve is the model; for &s;entiments were &s;poken by every character in the piece, whereas one &s;entimental character was &s;urely enough. If a man met with his mi&s;tre&s;s, or left her; if he was &s;uddenly fa|voured by fortune, or &s;uddenly the object of her hatred; if he was drunk, or married; he &s;poke a &s;entiment: if a lady was angry, or plea&s;ed; in love, or out of it; a prude, or a coquet; make room for a &s;entiment! If a &s;er|vant girl was chid, or received a pre&s;ent from her mi&s;tre&s;s; if a valet received a pur&s;e, or a hor&s;ewhipping; good heavens, what a fine &s;en|timent!</P>
<P>THIS fault I &s;ay was infinitely more ab&s;urd than that of Congreve; for a pea&s;ant may blunder on wit, to who&s;e mind &s;entiment is totally heterogeneous. Be&s;ides, Congreve's wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is all his own; whereas mo&s;t of the &s;aid &s;enti|ments may be found in the Proverbs of Solo|mon,</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="55">No wonder then this way of writing was &s;oon abandoned even by him who was its chief leader. Gold&s;mith in vain tried to &s;tem the torrent by oppo&s;ing a barrier of low humour, and dullne&s;s and ab&s;urdity, more dull and ab|&s;urd than Engli&s;h &s;entimental Comedy it&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT is very much to the credit of that excel|lent writer Mr. Colman, that, while other dra|mati&s;ts were lo&s;t in the fa&s;hion of &s;entiment, his comedies always pre&s;ent the happie&s;t medi|um of nature; without either affectation of &s;entiment, or affectation of wit. That the able tran&s;lator of Terence &s;hould yet have &s;ufficient force of mind to keep his own pieces clear of the declamatory dullne&s;s of that ancient, is certainly a matter de&s;erving of much applau&s;e. The Jealous Wife, and the Clande&s;tine Mar|riage, with others of his numerous dramas, may be mentioned as the mo&s;t perfect models of comedy we have: to all the other requi&s;ites of fine comic writing they always add ju&s;t as much &s;entiment and wit as does them good. This happy medium is the mo&s;t difficult to hit in all compo&s;ition, and mo&s;t declares the hand of a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="56">BY the School for Scandal the &s;tyle of Congreve was again brought into fa&s;hion; and &s;entiment made way for wit, and delicate hu|mour. That piece has indeed the beauties of Congreve's comedies, without their faults: its plot is deeply enough perplexed, without forc|ing one to labour to unravel it; its incidents &s;ufficient, without being too numerous; its wit pure; its &s;ituations truly dramatic. The cha|racters however are not quite &s;o &s;trong as Con|greve's; which may be regarded as the princi|pal fault of this excellent piece. Le&s;&s;er faults are Charles's &s;ometimes blundering upon &s;en|timents; nay &s;ometimes upon what are the wor&s;t of all &s;entiments, &s;uch as are of dan|gerous tendency, as when Rowley advi&s;es him to pay his debts, before he makes a very libe|ral pre&s;ent, and &s;o to act as an hone&s;t man ere he acts as a generous one.</P>

<P><PB N="49" REF="57">This &s;entiment, than which nothing can be more fal&s;e and immoral, is always received by the &s;illy audience with loud applau&s;e, whereas no reprobation can be too &s;evere for it.

<P><PB N="50" REF="58">IT may be ob&s;erved that every thing like a &s;entiment is &s;ure to meet with applau&s;e on our theatre; which the actors well expre&s;s by call|ing &s;entiments <HI>clap-traps.</HI> This trick of &s;ecur|ing applau&s;e by &s;entiments lately proved the &s;alvation of the very wor&s;t tragedy that ever appeared on any &s;tage: for the audience had &s;o much applauded the two fir&s;t acts, from the number of tho&s;e <HI>clap-traps,</HI> that they were a&s;hamed to retract, &s;o that the piece took a little run very quietly, to the di&s;grace of our ta&s;te, it being one of tho&s;e very farragos of non&s;en&s;e that The Rehear&s;al was written to expo&s;e to due &s;corn: and, had it been fabricated before the aera of that witty performance, it would certainly have had the honour of being placed in the fir&s;t &s;helf of ab&s;urdity.</P>

<P>HOW can you treat Petrarch with &s;o much contempt? Tho I agree with you that there is a tedious &s;amene&s;s in mo&s;t of his compo&s;itions, yet I by no means think him without his merit.

His &s;onnets, truly fine, and in which the train of thought varies, might be reduced to about a dozen. The real poetical beauties of Dante might likewi&s;e fall into very &s;mall compa&s;s; con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of the celebrated tale of Ugolino; and of that in the clo&s;e of the Vth Canto of the Inferno; which is as exqui&s;ite for tenderne&s;s, as the other is remarkable for terror. Now, that beauties of writers are fa&s;hionable reading, a &s;mall duodecimo extracted from the&s;e two poets would, if performed with ta&s;te, be an acceptable pre&s;ent to the public: for no

Yet were they both men of real genius; for &s;uperlative genius mu&s;t be di&s;covered from the amazing height it &s;ometimes ri&s;es to; tho at other times it di&s;|plays no extraordinary vigor. The genius of Petrarch is however more equal and correct than that of Dante; yet he by no means wanted &s;trength when he cho&s;e to exert it. Nor was Dante, who&s;e excellence is native force, defi|cient in de&s;cribing the tender pa&s;&s;ions, as may be &s;een in the Canto above referred to. Pe|trarch's learning almo&s;t de&s;troyed his genius.

<P>PERHAPS no que&s;tion of critici&s;m may afford room for more curious inve&s;tigation than this: <HI>In what quality does the perpetual and univer&s;al excellence of writing con&s;i&s;t?</HI> or, in other words, <HI>What property of compo&s;ition is certain to procure it the cla&s;&s;ic and legitimate admiration of all ages and countries?</HI></P>
<P>To decide on this point it is certainly the &s;ure&s;t method to judge of the future by the pa&s;t, and to pronounce that the &s;ame perfec|tions which have &s;ecured to an author of three thou&s;and years &s;tanding his due applau&s;e, will mo&s;t infallibly effect the &s;ame end to a modern writer.</P>
<P>A POET of fine talents, but of far &s;uperior ta&s;te, has pronounced wi&s;dom or good &s;en&s;e to be the very of fountain of perfect compo&s;ition.
<Q>Scribendi recte &s;apere e&s;t et principium et fons.</Q>
<PB N="57" REF="65">And this maxim will be found to hold true in every &s;pecies of writing whatever. Good &s;en&s;e may be called the &s;alt that pre&s;erves the other qualities of writing from corruption. This property is alike required in every branch of the belles lettres; but there are others which may be con&s;idered as confined to one particular path of writing.</P>
<P>SUCH is imaginary invention with re&s;pect to poetry: I &s;ay, imaginary invention, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h it here from that &s;cientific invention which belongs to the judgment. This inven|tion, as the parent of novelty, is the &s;uperlative qualification of poetry, and nothing can contri|bute more to procure it permanent admiration. Yet invention it&s;elf is inferior to &s;trong &s;en&s;e even in poetry, for there are poems in which the invention is rich yet di&s;gu&s;ts by its futility; not being conducted by that <HI>acer animi vis,</HI> that keen force of mind, which always accompanies true genius.</P>
<P>IF good &s;en&s;e is therefore a prai&s;e &s;uperior to invention it&s;elf in poetry, we may with great &s;afety pronounce it one of the very fir&s;t quali|ties that en&s;ures applau&s;e to compo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="66">A BEAUTIFUL work of genius may be aptly compared to a beautiful woman. Good &s;en&s;e may be called its health, without which it cannot live, charming as its other powers may be. But tho a woman has good health, it does not follow that &s;he is fair; nay we often ap|plaud a <HI>morbidezza,</HI> or an appearance of &s;ickly delicacy, as an improver of female beauty; and in this the compari&s;on fails. A works, as well as its pre&s;ent parallel, mu&s;t have the bloom and the features of beauty, with grace and elegance in its motions, to attract admiration. The bloom and fine features, the grace and elegance, of a work con&s;i&s;t in its &s;tyle; which is the part that is mo&s;t recommendatory of it, as outward beauty and grace are of a woman con&s;idered as an object of &s;ight.</P>
<P>THE bloom and the features of compo&s;ition lie in the verbage and figures of its &s;tyle; the grace in the manner and movement of that &s;tyle.</P>
<P>A work, immoral and unwi&s;e, has yet been found to live by its &s;tyle, in &s;pite of the&s;e de|fects. Style is therefore a quality of writing
<PB N="59" REF="67">equal, if not &s;uperior, to good &s;en&s;e: for the latter without the former will by no means pre&s;erve a work, tho the rever&s;e of the rule is true. Indeed a fine &s;tyle is commonly joined with good &s;en&s;e; both being the offspring of the &s;ame luminous mind.</P>
<P>CAN a work live long which is defective in &s;tyle? Impo&s;&s;ible. Homer's &s;tyle is the riche&s;t in the Greek language. Style has pre&s;erved Herodotus in &s;pite of his ab&s;urdities. Every ancient, who has reached us, has an eminent &s;tyle in his re&s;pective walk and manner. Style has &s;aved all the Latin writers, who are only good imitators of the Greeks. Terence is only the tran&s;lator of Menander; Sallu&s;t an imitator of Thucydides; Horace is an imitator and al|mo&s;t a tran&s;lator in all his odes, as we may boldly pronounce on comparing them with &s;uch very minute fragments of Grecian lyric poetry as have reached us. Yet it was he who exclaimed
<Q>O imitatores &s;ervum pecus!</Q>
Style has &s;aved Virgil entirely, who has not the mo&s;t di&s;tant pretence to any other attribute of a poet.</P>

<L>Cae&s;ariem madido torquentem cornua cirro?</L></Q>
Who would have thought that our &s;ide-curls and frizzled toupee had &s;uch antiquity, but along with that &s;uch barbari&s;m, as to be the fa&s;hion of the Germans ere they left their native woods? Tacitus in his excellent book of the manners of the Germans, mentions their twi&s;t|ing their locks into horns and rings, as he calls them.

<P>I TOTALLY controvert your opinion that our language has arrived at its highe&s;t pitch of refinement: &s;o far from that, I know of no writer before Gray who&s;e works are of cla&s;&s;ic correctne&s;s, except Milton.</P>
<P>HUME, I remember, tells us very gravely that the language of Pope is too much refined, as the language of &s;ome other writer, whom he names, is too little &s;o: but he gives Parnell as a &s;tandard author between the two extremes. This di&s;tinction is truly ridiculous, and worthy of a critic of the French &s;chool, for it has unluckily been di&s;covered that Pope improved the language of almo&s;t every line of Parnell, &s;o that he is almo&s;t as much the author of Par|nell's poems as Parnell him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="72">BY refinement here I mean a manner of writing more pure, and of more exqui&s;ite figures, than the run of even good compo&s;ition. Milton's poetry is almo&s;t univer&s;ally &s;uch, but far le&s;s equally than that of Gray; who u&s;es not a &s;ingle word without a due value being &s;tamped on it. This is cla&s;&s;ic refinement, in which not one word, one &s;yllable, is &s;uperflu|ous or improper.</P>
<P>POPE'S works are &s;uperabundant with &s;uper|fluous and unmeaning verbage; his tran&s;lations are even replete with tautology, a fault which is to refinement as midnight is to noon day. What is truly &s;urprizing is, that the fourth book of the Dunciad, his la&s;t publication, is more full of redundancy and incorrectne&s;s than his Pa&s;torals, which are his fir&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT of any works which have obtained considerable applau&s;e, Thom&s;on's poem of The Sea&s;ons is the mo&s;t incorrect. Any reader who under&s;tands grammar and cla&s;&s;ic compo&s;i|tion, is di&s;gu&s;ted in every page of that poem by faults, which, tho in them&s;elves minute, yet to a refined eye hide and ob&s;cure every
<PB N="65" REF="73">beauty however great, as a very &s;mall inter|vening object will intercept the view of the &s;un. This rea&s;on makes me very much &s;u&s;pect the fame of the Sea&s;ons will not be of long exi&s;tence; for I know of no work that has inherited long reputation which is deficient in &s;tyle, as the Sea&s;ons undoubtedly are to a mo&s;t remarkable degree. The fact is, that the poem on which the future celebrity of Thom&s;on will be founded is, by a &s;trange fatality, almo&s;t to|tally neglected at this day. That is, his Ca&s;tle of Indolence: a poem which has higher beauties than the Sea&s;ons, without any of the faults which di&s;grace that work; tho the conclu&s;ion even of this is mo&s;t ab&s;urd, and unhappy; and could never have occurred to a writer of ta&s;te except in a frightful dream.</P>
<P>BY the bye, Mr. Gray has clo&s;ely imitated a &s;tanza, or two, of the Ca&s;tle of Indolence, in his Elegy; as you will judge from comparing he exqui&s;ite de&s;cription of the manner in which the poet is &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s his time,</P>

<P>AN opinion that is oppo&s;ite to virtue is always oppo&s;ite to truth. This maxim, which, tho expre&s;&s;ed in few words, is the fruit of much ob&s;ervation, I have in no ca&s;e found more applicable than in that mo&s;t ab&s;urd po|pular error, that extravagance, and inattention to oeconomy, always accompany genius.</P>
<P>WE all flatter our&s;elves, in our youth e&s;pe|cially, that we are po&s;&s;e&s;t of that non-de&s;cript jewel called genius. Indeed, if the term genius have &s;o exten&s;ive a meaning as to imply capa|city in general, or <HI>capability,</HI> as Brown the ce|lebrated layer-out of grounds u&s;ed the phra&s;e, we cannot deny that every one has genius of one kind or another. A man may, if you will, have a very fine genius for &s;tupidity: a &s;ort of genius, which, tho I have not ob&s;erved to be mentioned in any treati&s;e on the &s;ubject, is yet at this day the mo&s;t lucrative &s;pecies of genius one can be po&s;&s;e&s;t of.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="80">GENIUS is in my e&s;timation a word of inef|fable reverence. The Gno&s;tic <HI>Abraxas</HI> it&s;elf is not to be weighed with it. Sometimes one man of genius ri&s;es in the &s;pace of one thou|&s;and years only: &s;ometimes, indeed, when na|ture is unu&s;ually rich, three or four will appear in one country in the cour&s;e of a century; as was the ca&s;e, when Bacon, Cromwell, Milton, Newton, illuminated England together, or at &s;hort &s;ucce&s;&s;ions. But now, good heaven! every man, every woman, every child, has genius. I will venture to prophe&s;y that, in the year 1883, from a natural progre&s;&s;ion of the word, genius will imply folly. The fact is, I have met with no man who in de&s;cribing genius did not tacitly paint him&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT, to di&s;cu&s;s the opinion mentioned in the beginning of this letter, we &s;hall, for the pre|&s;ent, con&s;ider genius in the popular &s;en&s;e, as merely oppo&s;ed to want of capacity for any art or &s;cience; and allow that middling quality which we imply, when we call a per&s;on, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> work, <HI>ingenious,</HI> to fall under the grand cla&s;s of GENIUS, Even allowing this, we mu&s;t &s;till, to form a proper judgment, rea&s;on from the

<P>IF we examine therefore the conduct of &s;uch men as all the world allows to have been endued with &s;uperlative genius, we &s;hall per|ceive that, &s;o far from being univer&s;ally cur&s;t with inattention to oeconomy, we &s;hall perhaps not find one example of want of that virtue among them. Of Homer we know nothing certain; and to build arguments upon fable is to write on &s;and. Pindar, tho extravagance it|&s;elf in his writings, yet was prudent enough to acquire great wealth by the &s;ale of them; and, what is more, to keep that wealth and u&s;e it with di&s;cretion. A French writer has wittily put it as the &s;tronge&s;t proof of Pindar's genius, that he &s;old his writings well to tho&s;e who could not under&s;tand a line of them.

A &s;entence that &s;urely would not have dropt from his pen, did his own manners contradict it; as we may always ob&s;erve that writers adapt their words to their actions, not their actions to their words.</P>
<P>IF we come now to our own country, we &s;hall find that genius has always been attended with oeconomy. Chaucer acquired wealth by his genius, and left it perfect to his heirs: &s;o did Shak&s;pere. Bacon, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, may be urged on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion; but the di&s;&s;ipation of his wealth was owing to no habit of extravagance on his part; but to his indulgence to his &s;ervants, and to ab&s;ence of mind. Milton, out of his &s;hattered fortune, found means from &s;trict oeconomy to leave a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to his wife and family. Newton's decency of life is well known. To conclude with Pope, who indeed can only rank with <HI>ingenious men,</HI> he ama&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable fortune; which he u&s;ed with the &s;tricte&s;t oeco|nomy, and propriety. A conduct which how|ever does not atone for his always mentioning,
<PB N="76" REF="84">in his poems, poverty as matter of reproach to others, and thus eternally bla&s;pheming the Providence that had made him rich.</P>
<P>THIS leads me to ob&s;erve, by the bye, the fal&s;ity of another popular opinion, which is, that poetry and poverty are as nearly related in fact, as in &s;ound. 'As poor as a poet' is almo&s;t a proverb, and took its ri&s;e from the itinerant min&s;trels, who, in former times, were poets by real profe&s;&s;ion or by trade. But few &s;eem to know that no bard of cla&s;&s;ic days has reached us whom we do not know to have been moderately rich, except Homer; who, for aught certain, may have been a petty king ju&s;t as likely as a beggar: and that modern times afford no real poets who were poor, except Spen&s;er and Ta&s;&s;o. Even with regard to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, we have no proof; and the po|verty of the latter was that of a man of high birth, not of a mendicant.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>I DO not wonder that your &s;earch after Bi&s;hop Hall's Satires has failed of &s;ucce&s;s; for perhaps there are few books in the lan|guage which are more uncommon. After reading that Pope, upon their being &s;hewn him, when he was far advanced in life, ex|pre&s;&s;ed great applau&s;e of them; and much regret that he had not chanced to &s;ee them &s;ooner; I do not wonder at your eagerne&s;s on this head: which in &s;ome mea&s;ure to gratify, I &s;end you extracts of his mo&s;t &s;hining pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>THE work opens with a kind of poetical preface, called A Defiance to Envy: the three fir&s;t lines of which are much in the &s;pirit of our author's great cotemporary, Shak&s;pere.
<Q><L>Nay let the prouder pines of Ida feare</L>
<L>The &s;udden fires of heaven, and decline</L>
<L>Their yielding tops, that dared the &s;kies whilere.</L></Q>
<PB N="78" REF="86">This couplet, in the Prologue to the Fir&s;t Book, is &s;trong,

In Satire I. &s;peaking of bad poetry, he &s;ays,
<Q>Or let it never live, or timely die.</Q>
In which, and many of the lines after quoted, you will be &s;urprized to find a &s;moothne&s;s and &s;trength not unworthy of Pope.

<BIBL>Sat. II.</BIBL></Q>
<HI>Bacchus' boiling blood</HI> were in the mouth of an ancient Greek, or Roman, writer, an exqui&s;ite phra&s;e for <HI>wine;</HI> but you know I declare war again&s;t the whole crew of heathen deities in modern ver&s;e.</P>
<P>THE following lines in Sat. IV. are worthy of Horace.

<L>The drawling &s;pondees pacing it below.</L></Q>
In Sat. VII. &s;hewing the folly of publi&s;hing ver&s;es on a mi&s;tre&s;s de&s;igned for a wife, he wittily exclaims,
<Q><L>Fond Wit-wal, that would&s;t load thy witle&s;s head</L>

Satire VIII. I tran&s;cribe entire for the &s;ake of its fine vein of irony. It is again&s;t &s;ome mi&s;e|rable poem called St. Peter's Complaint, writ|ten by a Robert Southwell.

<L>Now good St. Peter weeps pure Helicon;</L>
<L>And both the Marias make a mu&s;ic moan:</L>
<L>Yea and the prophet of the heavenly lyre,</L>
<L>Great Solomon, &s;ings in the Engli&s;h quire;</L>
<L>And is become a new-found &s;onnati&s;t;</L>

His Ec|logues, con&s;idered as works of invention, are beneath all contempt. Where he has not followed the tract of Theocritus, he has wandered into childi&s;h ab&s;urdity: witne&s;s the Pollio; in which, becau&s;e &s;ome &s;enator's wife was brought to bed of a chopping boy, he pro|phe&s;ies the golden age will return. I know &s;ome Chri&s;tian writers have applied this pro|phetic eclogue to an higher event&mdash;but I &s;ee you &s;mile in contempt;&mdash;and I pa&s;s the dreams of fanatici&s;m. Witne&s;s the Sixth Eclogue, into which a &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy has crept by &s;ome &s;trange back-door or other. A critic in the Adventurer has pronounced all the Pa&s;to|rals of Virgil exceptionable, except the Fir&s;t and Tenth: now in the&s;e there is no inven|tion, both of them, as that critic allows, deriv|ing their &s;uperiority from their being founded on real events. I conclude, therefore, that Vir|gil is, in his Pa&s;torals, no poet, but merely an excellent ver&s;ifier.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="101">IF we proceed to the Georgics, we &s;hall find as few marks of genius in them as in the Pa&s;torals, in &s;pite of the blind admiration which has been paid that poem. The &s;ubject is confe&s;&s;edly unhappy; for Virgil in this was the imitator of He&s;iod, as in his Pa&s;torals of Theocritus, and in his Aeneid of Homer.
<Q>O imitatores &s;ervum pecus!</Q>
was the ju&s;t exclamation of his more ingenious cotemporary, Horace. How blind, my friend, mu&s;t tho&s;e be who could not infer, if this remark be ju&s;t, how little is Virgil! Virgil, who&s;e who&s;e fame re&s;ts upon three &s;pecimens of imitation!</P>
<P>To examine the Georgics by the criterion of invention, which is that of genius and true poetry, we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that in a didactic poem, the precepts are quite out of the pro|vince of invention; and for this rea&s;on the didactic is the lowe&s;t of all the kinds of poetry. But the Georgics are allowed to be Virgil's chief work: the work on which his fame principally re&s;ts; tho he afterwards a&s;pired to be an epic writer, (what an epic writer!) and it follows, that, at the mo&s;t, Virgil is but an
<PB N="94" REF="102">excellent didactic writer, even in the opinion of his mo&s;t &s;anguine admirers: that is, if you plea&s;e, we will grant for a moment that he &s;tands fir&s;t in the very meane&s;t rank of poetry: &s;urely no high prai&s;e.</P>
<P>WHERE is his fame as a poet, if it is proved that even this prai&s;e, &s;lender as it is, is yet infinitely too high for him? Yet this will be ea&s;ily proved to tho&s;e who&s;e minds are not &s;ecured from the light of truth by the impene|trable &s;hades of prejudice.</P>
<P>A DIDACTIVE poem mu&s;t be written in &s;uch a &s;tyle as to be under&s;tood by tho&s;e to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed. If painting, for example, is the &s;ubject, the language ought to be &s;uch as may be under&s;tood by any painter of common intelligence. This rule, univer&s;ally ju&s;t as it is, mu&s;t always be followed; el&s;e the ab&s;urdity were as great as if a country curate &s;hould preach to his &s;taring pari&s;hioners in Hebrew, and expect they &s;hould follow precepts which it was impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould under&s;tand. Com|mon &s;en&s;e, my friend, which is &s;o uncommon a thing among the critics, and yet which enables
<PB N="95" REF="103">any man to judge better of writing than all the capricious dictates of critici&s;m, teaches us that the nece&s;&s;ity of following this rule is in|di&s;pen&s;able. Yet it has not been followed by Virgil, who writes to country farmers in a mo&s;t elaborate, and to them impenetrably ob|&s;cure, &s;tyle. Who can help &s;miling to &s;ee him con&s;tantly addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to people, who, as he well knew, could not po&s;&s;ibly under&s;tand him? Yet he is called the judicious Virgil, by tho&s;e who can &s;ee very near as far as their no&s;es, with the help of a borrowed lanthorn!</P>
<P>WHY dwell on particular ab&s;urdities of a production, which, in its very e&s;&s;ence, is ab|&s;urdity it&s;elf? Yet we mu&s;t not pa&s;s the Epi|&s;odes and ornaments of the Georgics, which have been hitherto allowed the very brighte&s;t proofs Virgil has given of genius or invention. Let us weigh the&s;e proofs, if po&s;&s;ible, in the very &s;cales which critical Ju&s;tice holds.</P>
<P>THE invocation to Cae&s;ar's &s;pirit, the &s;pirit of a tyrant, who trampled on the liberties of his country, could never have been written by a poet of real genius; for invincible hone&s;ty, of
<PB N="96" REF="104">mind has always been its attendant. Ful&s;ome flattery and adulation, unworthy of the &s;oul of a &s;lave, con&s;titute the merits of Virgil, in this admired addre&s;s. May execration pur&s;ue his memory, who has placed a crown on the brows of a tyrant, that were much too bright for the be&s;t of kings! The &s;igns preceding the death of Julius, enumerated in the end of the book, are in the &s;ame &s;tyle with the addre&s;s; &s;uper|&s;titious offerings on the altar of &s;lavery. They who find invention in either of the&s;e orna|ments, are welcome to feed on it, mixed up with a little whipt cream.</P>
<P>I ALLOW it were prejudice alone that could induce a reader to deny the beauty of the panegyric on a country life, which clo&s;es the Second Book; but at the &s;ame time it may be &s;afely &s;aid, that there are no marks in it of a &s;uperlative poet. Of invention there are &s;urely none, nor of originality; for the theme has been, in all ages of poetry, a trite one. Virgil in this pa&s;&s;age, therefore, as in others, only di&s;|plays great &s;kill in the mechanical part of poetry, but leaves the prai&s;e of a great poet to happier rivals.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="105">THE de&s;cription of the plague, in the end of the Third Book, is evidently in imitation of Lucretius, only more full and rich. But <HI>facile e&s;t inventis addere;</HI> and this Epi&s;ode may give Virgil the fame of a happy imitator, but never that of a true poet.</P>
<P>THE &s;tory of Ari&s;taeus in the la&s;t Book di&s;plays not the powers of Ovid, tho &s;uperior in cha&s;tity of ver&s;ification. But who ever &s;aid Ovid was a poet?</P>
<P>I TRUST it will appear from this deduction, that Virgil has not in his Pa&s;torals; nor in his Georgics, given any proofs of genius, inven|tion, or that which properly con&s;titutes a poet.</P>
<P>THE Aeneid &s;hall, if you like the &s;ubject, be examined &s;ome future opportunity; and will, I know, add &s;till le&s;s renown to Virgil as a crea|tor.</P>
<P>YET Virgil de&s;erves all his fame: a paradox, you will &s;ay, worthy of Rou&s;&s;eau.</P>

<P>YOUR ob&s;ervation, that there is a fatality which attends the reputation of authors, as well as other human affairs, is undoubtedly ju&s;t. How el&s;e shall we account for Milton's immortal poem lingering &s;o &s;lowly into fame, while the mo&s;t vapid productions of &s;ome of his cotemporaries acquired an in&s;tant celebrity, as wide as it was ill-founded?</P>
<P>DUBOS has given us a curious theory of the manner in which works of merit attain their due reputation. His reflections, like tho&s;e of other French critics, are &s;pecious without va|lue, and ma&s;&s;y without &s;olidity. Let us &s;trike again&s;t them: perhaps the truth will fly out.</P>
<P>'NEW productions,' &s;ays he, <Q>are at fir&s;t ap|preciated by judges of very different charac|ters; people of the trade, and the public. They would be very &s;oon e&s;timated at their
<PB N="99" REF="107">ju&s;t value, if the public was as capable of defending its opinion, and making it weigh properly, as it knows how to take the ju&s;t &s;ide. But it has the ea&s;ine&s;s to allow its judg|ment to be embarra&s;&s;ed by per&s;ons who pro|fe&s;s the art to which the new production be|longs. The&s;e per&s;ons are often apt to make a fal&s;e report, for rea&s;ons which we will ex|plain. They ob&s;cure the truth in &s;uch a manner, that the public remains for &s;ome time in uncertainty, or in error. It does not know preci&s;ely what title the new work me|rits. The public remains undecided on the que&s;tion, if it is good, or bad, on the whole: and it even &s;ometimes believes people of the profe&s;&s;ion, who deceive it; but it only be|lieves them for a very &s;hort time.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THAT fir&s;t period being elap&s;ed, the public appreciates a work at its ju&s;t value; and gives it the rank which it de&s;erves, or condemns it to utter oblivion. It is never deceived, be|cau&s;e it judges di&s;intere&s;tedly, and becau&s;e it judges by &s;entiment.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="108">SUCH are the reflections of the Abb&eacute; du Bos, whom I will readily allow to be the mo&s;t judicious of the French critics, if that is any prai&s;e. Truth is again&s;t them. Let us examine their ju&s;tice by an illu&s;trious in&s;tance.</P>
<P>PARADISE LOST was &s;old by John Milton to his book&s;eller on the twenty-&s;eventh day of April 1667, during the witty and ingenious reign of Charles II. when Dryden was at the head of poetry and critici&s;m. Did it in&s;tantly a&s;toni&s;h the world as if a new &s;un had ari&s;en? No. Three years pa&s;&s;ed, changes of titles, and other book&s;elling arts, were employed ere a &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion could be &s;old, tho not one of the trade of poetry perplexed the public opi|nion. Dryden, who was at the head of that trade, was the fir&s;t to perceive and to applaud its beauties. Critici&s;m was the general pur&s;uit of that age, which was fully as enlightened on that head as the pre&s;ent. What happened them would have happened now: in the year 1767 Milton's divine poem would have met exactly the &s;ame reception as in 1667. And why The an&s;wer is evident: the work was in a &s;tyle of poetry above the popular conception;
<PB N="101" REF="109">and the judgment of true judges, tho it always prevails, yet prevails with as much &s;lowne&s;s as certainty.</P>
<P>IN this lies the grand mi&s;take of du Bos. He &s;uppo&s;es the public judges for it&s;elf: it is always led by peculiar opinions, and the recti|tude of its &s;entiments depends entirely upon the &s;uperiority of its leaders being founded in truth, or merely in fa&s;hion. By <HI>the public,</HI> I under&s;tand with him, people of &s;ome know|lege and &s;ome reading. A man who reads for his amu&s;ement books in his own language, and can talk a little on what he reads, may afford a kind of ab&s;tract idea of what is meant by <HI>the public.</HI> Now I will venture to compute from real ob&s;ervation, that not 99 out of 100, who pretend to admire Milton, are capable of under&s;tanding that writer. Why then has he a place in their libraries? Becau&s;e he is men|tioned with high applau&s;e by writers of reputa|tion.</P>
<P>HAD not Addi&s;on written his &s;uperficial cri|tici&s;m on Milton, which is indeed adapted to the meane&s;t capacity, other men of learning
<PB N="102" REF="110">would have brought him into vogue: for a &s;uperior poet is always the poet of the learned, before he is that of the public at large.</P>
<P>WITNESS the Comus, L'Allegro, Il Pen&s;e|ro&s;o, the exqui&s;ite productions of the &s;ame author; which remained a fea&s;t for the learned alone, for near a century after their publica|tion. They were publi&s;hed in 1645, and were taken no notice of. The Comus, L'Allegro, Il Pen&s;ero&s;o, were taken no notice of at a pe|riod when we &s;ometimes find <HI>the tenth edition</HI> upon ma&s;&s;es of metrical non&s;en&s;e that are now unknown to have exi&s;ted! Let the public after this judge for it&s;elf. A &s;econd edition of the&s;e divine poems did not appear till 1673; and even then they were not republi&s;hed, becau&s;e they were called for, but becau&s;e they made a &s;izeable volume with his Paradi&s;e Regained, then fir&s;t publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>WHAT is the rea&s;on of &s;uch poems falling into &s;ilence? Is it not becau&s;e tho&s;e learned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en who happened to &s;ee and admire them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o opportunity of recommending them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> notice?</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="111">AT the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that it is the impartial, uninfluenced, opinion of men of learning, that commands the public judgement; not that of &s;uch men of learning as are friends of the author: for &s;uch deci&s;ions the public, however highly it may rate the abilities of him who pronounces them, yet has always di&s;cernment enough to &s;et a&s;ide.</P>
<P>SELDOM does it even happen, that the opi|nion of cotemporary men of learning influ|ences the public: which is the rea&s;on that the works of any living writer are very &s;eldom ju&s;tly appreciated. Yet it may &s;o happen that a writer, from a happy circum&s;tance, may ac|quire a reputation as ju&s;t as it is in&s;tantaneous. This was the ca&s;e with the late Mr. Gray, who by his happening to be conver&s;ant in fa&s;hionable company, gained a complete cen|tury in point of reputation. For, tho fa&s;hion|able writers are mot ju&s;tly &s;et in oppo&s;ition to good, the very epithet implying that their works will not la&s;t; yet fa&s;hion is now and then in the right, as well as other fools.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="112">IT is above ob&s;erved, that the opinion of cotemporary judges, decides not that of the public. The truth is, there are works of &s;uperlative merit, of which the mo&s;t learned cotemporary can form no true e&s;timate; for works of uncommon excellence require to be viewed at a certain di&s;tance, and in a certain light, to have their due effect. Set a picture of Raphael's again&s;t the blaze of the noonday &s;un, and its beauties will be as little di&s;cerned as at midnight. Let me add, that an eminent writer is &s;eldom the writer of his own times: his mature mind precedes the advancement of his art and language very often by a full cen|tury: &s;o that one hundred years, and &s;ome|times more, mu&s;t elap&s;e, ere the public has acquired intelligence enough to judge of him.</P>

<P><PB N="118" REF="126">NOR do I agree with you, that the modern lyric poets of any rank are le&s;s numerous than the ancient; and, to &s;upport my difference of opinion, &s;ubmit to you &s;ome &s;hort account of the former. This I do the more readily, as I know your &s;tudies have not been much ex|tended on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>OUR re&s;earches on this head &s;hall be con|fined to the modern lyric poetry of Italy, of France, and of England. The Spani&s;h writers in this line, Lopez de Vega, Gongora, &amp;c. I leave to tho&s;e who have a &s;oul lofty enough to under&s;tand bomba&s;t, and grovelling enough to under&s;tand non&s;en&s;e. Tho&s;e writers who do not know the art of gilding lead, may learn it of the Spani&s;h poets. The works of Uz, the German, I cannot pretend to &s;peak of, as I hope I &s;hall never &s;tudy High Dutch; but, were they of any value, I doubt not but &s;ome of them would have appeared before this in a more intelligible tongue.</P>
<P>TO begin then with the Italians, Petrarca &s;hines in the very fir&s;t rank of honour, as of age. One or two of his Odes or Canzoni have
<PB N="119" REF="127">already<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter VIII.</NOTE> been &s;aid in a former letter to be ex|cellent; and one excellent ode is as much pre|ferable to a number of middling ones (tho&s;e of Horace for in&s;tance) as a piece of gold is to a number of pieces of &s;ilver. His Sonnets I do not con&s;ider as lyric, but as elegiac.</P>
<P>NOT to &s;peak of Bembo, Ca&s;a, or Molza, the odes of Chiabrera have often grand pa&s;|&s;ages, tho he is more commonly a <HI>Seicento;</HI> by which name the Italians under&s;tand a writer of the &s;eventeenth century, when a fal&s;e ta&s;te was introduced by Marini, in place of the pure &s;lyle which had reigned till that time.</P>
<P>SOME of the Anacreontic odes of Menzini are as fine pieces as have been produced in that very delicate and difficult mode of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>GUIDI &s;ometimes catches the true lyric &s;pi|rit, but more often his fire is lo&s;t in &s;moke; &s;o that he frequently rever&s;es the ob&s;ervation of Horace, <HI>non fumum ex fulgore,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="128">OF the works of Fulvio Te&s;ti, I mu&s;t profe&s;s much e&s;teem, tho they &s;eem neglected by his countrymen. He appears to have attained the genuine texture of lyric thought and &s;tyle more than any other Italian poet I know, without exception. His images are frequently very rich and happy. For example might he adduced the whole famous Ode to Montecuculli, which co&s;t the author his life, particularly the begin|ning:

<P><PB N="125" REF="133">YOU will excu&s;e my dwelling &s;o long on the merits of a writer, who&s;e worth (and it is great!) is almo&s;t unknown in this country.

<P>IF the French have any title to a legitimate poetry, it is that of the le&s;&s;er lyric &s;tyle. Their language, pretty and familiar, can never ri&s;e to the &s;ublime; which indeed, &s;o far as I can &s;ee, their poets of any cla&s;s have never yet attained, not excepting Corneille him&s;elf, who&s;e vaunted <HI>Qu'il mourut</HI> is, to a Briti&s;h reader, a very trivial thought. We &s;hould deny the French, with their epic poems, tra|gedies, and comedies in rime! any poetry at all, were it not for &s;uch writers as La Fontaine in the le&s;&s;er narrative, and Malherbe, Chaulieu, De la Motte, and the elder Rou&s;&s;eau, in the lyric.</P>
<P>RONSARD was once a fa&s;hionable lyric writer in France, and nothing can be a &s;tronger proof of the fal&s;e ta&s;te of his age. We have in our days &s;een a writer fa&s;hionable, becau&s;e he u&s;ed a pedantic jargon of Roman Engli&s;h; Ron&s;ard
<PB N="127" REF="135">was likewi&s;e fa&s;hionable in his day, becau&s;e he wrote in Grecian French. I hope by and bye the time will come when the mo&s;t di&s;tant imitation of the &s;entiments and manner of cla&s;&s;ic writers (for example, Boileau's of Horace and Juvenal) will become, as it de&s;erves, as ridiculous and contemptible as Ron&s;ard's adop|tion of their verbage and idiom.</P>
<P>MALHERBE has great merit, as the refiner and re&s;torer of the French language; but I know of only one ode he has written which may yet be read with plea&s;ure; and that is the one addre&s;&s;ed to the Duke of Bellegarde.</P>
<P>CHAULIEU'S character and works you well know: he is read more, and De la Motte le&s;s, than he ought to be. The real beauties of De la Motte's odes are thicker &s;own than tho&s;e of any other French writer.</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU'S ode To Fortune has been much prai&s;ed; but, in my opinion, yields to that ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the Marquis de la Fare, which has great merit: witne&s;s the&s;e &s;tanzas.

<P>THE merit of Gre&s;&s;et, in &s;ome of his lyric poems, you well know. I need not therefore dwell upon it; and as I know no other of the French lyric writers who de&s;erve mention, I shall pa&s;s to the Engli&s;h, after ju&s;t ob&s;erving, that Boileau's noted ode, &s;o replete with tin&s;el, and with non&s;en&s;e, proves that he had not the &s;malle&s;t &s;park of poetical genius; and that he could not even have ari&s;en above the meane&s;t cla&s;s of &s;criblers, had he not been the very ape
<PB N="130" REF="138">of the ancients; and had the addre&s;s and agi|lity of that animal &s;ometimes to jump on the &s;houlders of his ma&s;ters, and the impudent ignorance to look big when dre&s;&s;ed in their cloaths.</P>
<P>THE li&s;t of Engli&s;h lyric poets contains the names of Waller, Milton, Cowley, Dryden, Collins, Gray, and Aken&s;ide; not to mention the Earl of Surrey, who is more venerable from his age, than valuable from his compo&s;i|tion. Waller has no merit, &s;ave that of Mal|herbe in France, that of polishing and refining the language of his country. He has even le&s;s merit than Malherbe, his pages being evident proofs of that old doubt, <HI>datur vacuum.</HI> I have read him over thrice, to &s;ee upon what his fame &s;tands; but could not ob&s;erve one image, &s;en|timent, or expre&s;&s;ion that &s;poke the poet. The fact is, his fame is founded upon his e&s;tate, which was of five thou&s;and a year, a wide foundation for renown! His language, which is by no means valuable now, and of con&s;e|quence, no foundation for pre&s;ent fame, was the amber that pre&s;erved his weeds from rot|ting: but as that is no longer in price, the
<PB N="131" REF="139">whole editions of his works may be thrown into the fire, without any diminution Eng|li&s;h poetry. Why &s;hould I dwell on the worth of Milton in his lyric works of Lycidas, Il Pen&s;ero&s;o, L'Allegro; or of Dryden in his ce|lebrated Ode? Cowley's Pindarics may accom|pany Waller's works with all my heart: one or two of his Anacreontics are good. The merit of Collins lies in his tender melancholy; his defects are confu&s;ion and incorrectne&s;s of &s;tyle. Gray is the fir&s;t and greate&s;t of modern lyric writers; nay, I will venture to &s;ay, of all lyric writers: his works tho few (alas, how few!) uniting the perfections of every lyric poet, both of pre&s;ent and former times. Tho Aken&s;ide, con&s;idered as a lyric writer, wants richne&s;s of images and melody, his &s;tyle will ever render what he has done in this way valuable.</P>
<P>THUS I have now enumerated all the mo|dern reputable authors of lyric poetry. They are not few: and I hope you are now con|vinced, that they yield not to the ancient in number, nor in merit; tho the lyric mu&s;e is now almo&s;t confined to the private cell of
<PB N="132" REF="140">&s;tudy; and &s;eldom appears in her ancient glory, attended by the riche&s;t mu&s;ic, and graced with the audience of heroes.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>THAT five acts &s;hould be con&s;idered as an e&s;&s;ential divi&s;ion of a perfect drama, rather than any other number, is perhaps one of the &s;trange&s;t in&s;tances its which reverence for a rule laid down by an ancient poet, who&s;e infallibility has never yet been proved, has totally got the better of common &s;en&s;e, and of the &s;uperiority of modern &s;cience.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER that Vitruvius gives a rea&s;on, perhaps as well grounded as any can be, for this arbitrary divi&s;ion, namely, That the dra|matic poets divided their fables into parts by a cubical ratio<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Divi&s;erunt &s;patia fabularum in partes cubica ratione.</NOTE>. That is, as Mr. Dacier ex|plains it, that the four &s;ongs of the chorus be|tween the acts, joined with the prologue and <HI>exode,</HI> formed the cubic number <HI>&s;ix,</HI> the mo&s;t perfect of numbers! A rea&s;on that could only
<PB N="134" REF="142">have occurred to an architect; yet perhaps as well grounded as any that can be given for a cu&s;|tom which admits of no rea&s;on. It &s;omething re&s;embles a rule which Menage, in his notes on Ta&s;&s;o's Aminta, tells us is laid down by the Signior Giovan Ogerio Gombaldo, a per&s;onage, as Menage takes care to inform us, <HI>intelligen|ti&s;&s;imo delle co&s;e della poe&s;ia dramnatica,</HI> mo&s;t ex|pert in dramatic bu&s;ine&s;s. This rule is, that the principal ladies in dramatic poems ought not to appear at the opening of the piece, when the fir&s;t &s;cenes are &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s in the morn|ing; <HI>if the affair is not very important indeed.</HI> For why? For rea&s;on good and weighty. <HI>E&s;&s;endo proprio delle Donne it levar&s;i tardi, l'impiegar molto tempo in abbellir&s;i, a far&s;i a&s;pet|tare:</HI> It being u&s;ual for ladies to ri&s;e late, to take a long time to dre&s;s, and to give long expectation before they appear. Hear, ye dra|matic poets of our impolite age! learn wi&s;|dom: and bow with reverence to the manes of Signior Giovan Ogerio Gombaldo!</P>
<P>JESTING apart, we all know that Horace's rule is not authori&s;ed by the Greek ma&s;ters of the drama, their plays being often divided into
<PB N="135" REF="143">three, four, &s;ix, &s;even, eight, but &s;eldom, if ever, into five acts; in the intervals between the&s;e divi&s;ions the chorus &s;ung, and interludes were performed. For Ca&s;aubon, in his learned work <HI>De Satyrica Poe&s;i,</HI> will have it, that, between the acts, the &s;cene was often totally vacant of the tragic repre&s;entation; and that the &Sgr;&Agr;&Tgr;&Ugr;|&Rgr;&Igr;&Kgr;&Agr;, or farces, were played to relieve the audience from the melancholy feelings of tra|gedy; a practice we would recommend as a further improvement, to tho&s;e <HI>&s;emiliterati</HI> among us who wi&s;h to revive the ancient cho|rus accompanied with mu&s;ic, but who would &s;tare, were they told by &s;omebody, who had read two books, that they are as far from the ancient drama as ever; THE WHOLE OF IT BEING ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED WITH MUSIC. I think, however, the ta&s;te of the ancients might be vindicated from Ca&s;aubon's accu&s;a|tion, as I differ from that learned man in his interpretation of the pa&s;&s;age on which it is founded. It is of Marius Victorinus, the gram|marian, and &s;tands as follows: <HI>Haec apud Grae|cos metri &s;pecies</HI> (iambica) <HI>frequens e&s;t &s;ub hac con|ditionis lege, ut not heroas, aut reges, &s;ed Satyros inducat; ludendi, jocandique cau&s;a, quo &s;pectatoris
<PB N="136" REF="144">animus inter tri&s;tes res tragicas Satyrorum jocis relaxetur.</HI> Ca&s;aubon ob&s;erves, that the &s;ame phra&s;e, <HI>inter res tragicas,</HI> is likewi&s;e u&s;ed on the &s;ame occa&s;ion by Diomedes, another gram|marian, which I &s;uppo&s;e only ari&s;es from the one's copying the other; and that the phra&s;e in both only implies, <HI>inter cogitationes rerum tragicarum;</HI> as a &s;pectator may be &s;aid to be, <HI>inter res tragicas,</HI> "occupied with tragic affairs," as well immediately after the performance of a tragedy as during its repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>BUT to come to the point, I have a great veneration for the ancients, but a far greater for truth and common &s;en&s;e: and it may, I believe, be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that had the ancients arrived at our perfection in the drama (a &s;ub|ject perhaps of future di&s;cu&s;&s;ion), they would, upon omi&s;&s;ion of the chorus, have confined their drama to three as of modern duration, as the mo&s;t proper form and length. Douglas, one of the &s;horte&s;t of our tragedies, has up|wards of 1800 lines; the Edipus Tyrannus of Sophocles, one of the longe&s;t, of antiquity, has but 1536, with all its choru&s;es, which make no part of the proper dramatic action, and
<PB N="137" REF="145">only corre&s;pond to our mu&s;ic between the acts. Deduct 300 lines belonging to the Chorus of Edipus, and Douglas will exceed it by 600 lines, or the length of two acts. If Douglas therefore had but three acts, it were equal in length to the ancient tragedies.</P>
<P>THIS, with an admirer of the ancients, may perhaps afford a &s;trong argument for the reduction of our drama to a &s;horter duration. But let us bring &s;till &s;tronger arguments from our own rea&s;on, nay from that of the ancients them&s;elves.</P>
<P>PLATO has ob&s;erved in his Parmenides, that A WHOLE ACTION always con&s;i&s;ts of three parts, <HI>a beginning, a middle, and an end.</HI> Ari&s;|totle, in his book on Poetry, has with great ju&s;tice applied this ob&s;ervation (but without acknowleging its author) to the drama: con|necting it with the conduct of the fable in the&s;e words, <Q>The <HI>beginning</HI> is that part which gives no room to &s;uppo&s;e that any thing ought to have preceded it</Q> (he means in the repre&s;entation) <Q>and which nece&s;&s;arily implies that &s;omething mu&s;t follow. The <HI>end</HI> is
<PB N="138" REF="146">quite the rever&s;e; for it implies that nothing &s;hould follow it, but that &s;omething mu&s;t have preceded it. The <HI>middle</HI> implies, that &s;omething mu&s;t precede it, and likewi&s;e &s;omething follow.</Q> This ob&s;ervation may be far more happily employed in the divi&s;ion of the drama. The fir&s;t act, or <HI>beginning,</HI> will then fix the &s;pectator's attention, by opening the plot, and rai&s;ing his expectation: the &s;e|cond, or <HI>middle,</HI> will further continue his per|plexity, till he is utterly at a lo&s;s to conceive how the piece will terminate; and the third, or <HI>end,</HI> will relieve him from that embara&s;&s;|ment and agreeable anxiety, after it is carried to the utmo&s;t, by an unexpected, yet natural cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>ARISTOTLE likewi&s;e prai&s;es the length ad|judged to the ancient drama, becau&s;e the &s;pec|tator was able clearly to recollect and compare every circum&s;tance from beginning to end. The ancient drama, as we have already &s;een, is &s;horter, by the duration of two acts, than the modern; and the ob&s;ervation of Ari&s;totle will not apply to the modern drama, for it is &s;o long, that it is not ea&s;y for the &s;pectator to
<PB N="139" REF="147">recapitulate, and ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of &s;o lengthened a &s;tory, perplexed and ravelled as every good drama is.</P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;trong rea&s;on is, that the authors of modern dramatic perfomances always labour &s;o much under the duration they mu&s;t extend their plot to, that they are forced, of nece&s;&s;ity, to have recour&s;e to foreign and adventitious circum&s;tances, merely to eke out their pieces to a proper length. Hence our love epi&s;odes and under plots; and many of the other glar|ing ab&s;urdities of the modern theatre; our dra|matic writers never having found out, that the length alloted was more than any pure un|mixed &s;ingle action (one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential attributes of the drama) would admit of, either according to the practice of the ancients, or common rea&s;on and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e arguments, I look upon the divi&s;ion of the fable into three acts, into a beginning, a middle, and an end, as the mo&s;t perfect, compact, and elegant, that the higher drama will admit. Tho indeed I &s;ee not &s;o great rea&s;on again&s;t four as again&s;t five acts,
<PB N="140" REF="148">when the plot requires a longer period than u&s;ual to adju&s;t and deduce. Five and &s;even &s;trike every mind as uncouth and heterogene|ous numbers. This remark, you will &s;ay, has no great depth, nor philo&s;ophy; but what have our amu&s;ements, the &s;ubjects of our pre&s;ent examination, to do with depth or philo&s;ophy? Five modern acts may be looked upon as al|mo&s;t too long a duration for any fable fit for dramatic repre&s;entation: four have been ad|mitted by one of our be&s;t living writers with much &s;ucce&s;s. The u&s;ual divi&s;ion of the drama here combated is one proof, among many, of the power of cu&s;tom above that of truth and of nature:

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>I PROPOSE in this Letter to continue and conclude my examination of the merits of Virgil as a poet, which I began on a former occa&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter XVI.</NOTE>. This &s;crutiny has already been ex|tended to his Bucolics and Georgics; and &s;hall, in the la&s;t place, be applied to his Eneid, which is confe&s;&s;ed by his admirers to be much inferior to his Georgics; a poem before &s;hewn to have very little claim to applau&s;e. Let us examine this Eneid with regard to its plan, its characters, and its language, the grand divi|&s;ions of epic poetry.</P>
<P>IF we take ever &s;o cur&s;ory a view of the fable of the Eneid, we &s;hall perceive it to be &s;ervilely copied from Homer's two immortal poems, the Iliad and the Ody&s;&s;ey. The la&s;t of the&s;e gives the general de&s;ign of the fir&s;t &s;ix books of the Eneid, the Iliad of the &s;ix la&s;t.
<PB N="145" REF="153">The &s;tory of Dido, which is con&s;idered as the only proof that Virgil gives of originality or genius in all the Eneid, even by his admirers them&s;elves, is a mo&s;t injudicious and ab&s;urd imitation of Homer's Circe. It is injudicious, becau&s;e Dido from her courage and manly &s;pi|rit, &s;hewn in leading a colony from her native realm to a remote and barbarous land, and &s;ettling and ruling that colony there, mu&s;t in the book of human nature, page fir&s;t, be read to have been a character very little &s;u&s;ceptible of tender pa&s;&s;ions, far le&s;s of carrying them to &s;uch exce&s;s as Virgil repre&s;ents. It is injudi|cious, becau&s;e Dido had formerly borne the lo&s;s of a hu&s;band without de&s;peration; n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y had &s;hewn a &s;pirit upon the occa&s;ion almo&s;t too heroic for a woman: there is therefore no con&s;i&s;tency in the character of Dido; which is certainly one of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t faults any writer can be guilty of. It is injudicious, becau&s;e there is likewi&s;e in this love &s;tory an incon&s;i&s;t|ency in the character of Eneas, which any &s;chool-boy would be a&s;hamed of; the character of Eneas is that of perfect piety: the PIOUS ENEAS gratifies the irregular pa&s;&s;ions of a fond woman; and then, in return for the kindne&s;s
<PB N="146" REF="154">&s;he hath &s;hewn to him and his followers, he for&s;akes her without remor&s;e, becau&s;e the gods command him &s;o to do. Impious Virgil! would a Greek reader have cried; Homer only wounded the bodies of the gods, and their le&s;&s;er morals; but you have &s;truck at their very vitals, their e&s;&s;ence! You have made them guilty of cruelty, of inju&s;tice, of ingratitude it&s;elf! Eneas, if he was pious, ought to have known that his gods could not be guilty of impiety; and to have di&s;dained any imputation to the contrary, tho communicated in a vi&s;ion. This &s;tory is la&s;tly utterly ab&s;urd, and might have been added to our in&s;tances of that figure of &s;peech, becau&s;e in defiance of chronology, and of propriety, Virgil brings characters toge|ther as living at the &s;ame period, the no le&s;s than 410 years a&s;under. What &s;hould we &s;ay of a writer, who &s;hould now introduce into an epic poem Alexander the Great making love to Julia the daughter of Augu&s;tus? Yet this were not &s;o ab&s;urd by near a century as the amour of Eneas with Dido.</P>
<P>WHY &s;hould I be condemned to follow Vir|gil thro all his feeble imitations of Homer, in
<PB N="147" REF="155">the plan and conduct of the Eneid? Virgil's &s;torm is Homer's, tho Homer would not have begun with it. The conver&s;ations of the gods are all Homer's, Virgil meets Venus, Uly&s;&s;es Nau&s;icaa. The &s;tory of Dido hath already been &s;poken of. Homer hath games! Virgil hath games; his very &s;hips, which he introduces as a novelty, prove him incapable of originality, for their accidents are from Homer's races. Homer's &s;hips are on fire, Virgil's are on fire. If Uly&s;&s;es goes to hell, Eneas goes to hell. If Homer enumerates the forces of both parties; &s;o doth Virgil. The tale of Cacus is indeed a puerility; and the pa&s;&s;age, in which Eneas is repre&s;ented as going <HI>his own amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> an ab|&s;urdity that would not have entered even into the dreams of Homer. Virgil indeed found the latter ludicrous invention, of a prince and general leaving his army when &s;urrounded by enemies, in order to go an emba&s;&s;y, which the faithful Achates was certainly the &s;it per&s;on to mediate: I &s;ay, he found this nece&s;&s;ary to intro|duce the affected and &s;illy epi&s;ode of Ni&s;us and Euryalus, which is <HI>wondrous pitiful.</HI> Homer de&s;cribes the &s;hield of Achilles; &s;o doth Virgil that of Eneas. Virgil then &s;ends Iris to Turnus,
<PB N="148" REF="156">to let him know that Eneas was ab&s;ent from his army at a time when there was the &s;tronge&s;t nece&s;&s;ity for his pre&s;ence; and that it is a lucky hit.
<Q><L>Turne quod optanti divum promittere nemo</L>
<L>Auderet, volvenda dies en attulit ultro.</L></Q>
Nay, to increa&s;e the ab&s;urdity, &s;he tells Turnus that his wi&s;e competitor is gone, not to pro|cure a proper martial aid, but to arm the coun|try, <HI>collectos armat agre&s;tes.</HI> Wonderful con|trivance! How we &s;hould have laughed at it in Blackmore! Turnus takes the advice, and at|tacks the Trojan camp, becau&s;e Hector had attacked that of the Greeks. The night &s;cene and &s;laughter is a poor copy of that in the Iliad. Uly&s;&s;es and Diomed were the proper per&s;onages of &s;uch an action, not two boys like Ni&s;us and Euryalus: <HI>incredulus odi.</HI> The whole &s;cene of the camp is &s;uch a copy of Homer's &s;cene at the &s;hips, as a wooden print is of a painting of Corregio. In the tenth book the gods come in again to fill up the &s;tory. Who will hint the mo&s;t di&s;tant compari&s;on of the return of Eneas with that of Achilles, tho evi|dently a paltry copy? Achilles leaves the fight from the mo&s;t potent rea&s;ons; Eneas leaves the
<PB N="149" REF="157">camp and the conflict, merely that he may re|turn. The death of Pallas (by the bye a mo&s;t improper name for a man, as it breeds an eter|nal confu&s;ion with the godde&s;s Pallas or Mi|nerva) is that of Patroclus; <HI>quantum mutatus ab illo!</HI> The funeral of Pallas is al&s;o that of Pa|troclus. The emba&s;&s;ies for burying the dead, &amp;c. &amp;c. are all from Homer: not a death in the &s;ub&s;equent battle but from him. The combat of Eneas and Turnus, the leading fea|ture of the twelfth and la&s;t book, every one perceives at fir&s;t &s;ight to be a &s;ervile and pitiful imitation of that of Achilles and Hector.</P>
<P>SO much for the plan and fable of the Eneid. If we examine its characters, we &s;hall find it &s;till more defective; defective to a degree below contempt. It hath been &s;aid by Virgil's ad|mirers, that Homer had exhau&s;ted &s;trong and martial characters; therefore Virgil was forced to have recour&s;e to gentle ones: gentle charac|ters for an heroic poem! The fact is, that all Virgil's characters, &s;uch as they are, con&s;i&s;t of copies, or remote imitations, of Homer; and that Homer's &s;ub&s;ervient, his lowe&s;t, characters are Virgil's fir&s;t and highe&s;t ones. Wonderful
<PB N="150" REF="158">poet! Judicious imitator! To compare all the characters were tedious and needle&s;s; but be a&s;&s;ured, that, upon accurate enquiry, every cha|racter whatever of the Eneid may be found in the Iliad or Ody&s;&s;ey in as &s;trong a degree as the plot and leading incidents above pointed out.</P>
<P>TO conclude with the language of the Eneid, there is not one &s;entiment or image in it but may be found in Homer, or other Greek poets. And I firmly believe from the ob&s;ervations of Macrobius on this head, that there is not one phra&s;e in it that is not &s;tolen from preceding Latin poets; that writer having told us in his Saturnalia, and indeed proved in many in|&s;tances, that Virgil's whole poetry is only a <HI>cento</HI> taken from more ancient authors.</P>
<P>SUCH is the Eneid, which the author with good rea&s;on on his death-bed condemned to the flames; and, had it &s;uffered that fate, real poetry would have lo&s;t nothing by it. I have &s;aid, that, notwith&s;tanding all, Virgil de&s;erves his fame; for his fame is now confined to &s;chools and academies; and his &s;tyle (the pickle that has pre&s;erved his mummy from corruption) is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and exqui&s;ite.</P>

As I &s;incerely wi&s;h him well, and know his regard for my opinion, I &s;hall &s;ubmit to you a few thoughts on the &s;ub|ject, which you may communicate to him at a proper hour.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="160">LORD BACON, one of the wi&s;e&s;t men that any age or country hath produced, &s;peaking of political affairs, ob&s;erves, <Q>that no kind of men love bu&s;ine&s;s for it&s;elf, but tho&s;e that are learned; for other per&s;ons love it for profit, as an hireling that loves the work for the wages. Or for honour, as becau&s;e it beareth them up in the eves of men, and refre&s;heth their reputations which other|ways would wear. Or becau&s;e it putteth them in mind of their fortune, and giveth them occa&s;ion to plea&s;ure, and di&s;plea&s;ure. Or becau&s;e it exerci&s;eth &s;ome faculty wherein they take pride; and &s;o entertaineth them in good humour, and plea&s;ing conceits towards them&s;elves. Or becau&s;e it advanceth any other their ends. So that, as it is &s;aid of un|true valours, that &s;ome men's valours are in the eyes of them that look on; &s;o &s;uch mens indu&s;tries are in the eyes of others, or at lea&s;t in regard of their own de&s;ignments. Only learned men love bu&s;ine&s;s as an action according to nature; as agreeable to health of mind as exerci&s;e is to health of body; t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">king plea&s;ure in the action it&s;elf, and not in the purcha&s;e. So that of all men they are
<PB N="153" REF="161">the mo&s;t indefatigable, if it be towards any bu&s;ine&s;s that can hold or detain their mind.</Q> This quotation, tho long, is &s;o completely to the point, that no &s;entence of it could be &s;pared. The argument contained in it is extremely for|cible, and ought to weigh with the mo&s;t un|thinking mind; for he ob&s;erves, that none but men of learning love bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;tate for it&s;elf; and certainly, if a man takes no delight in, makes not his &s;upreme plea&s;ure of, his bu&s;ine&s;s, let it be of whatever kind, he will never ma|nage it well, much le&s;s ri&s;e to eminence in it.</P>
<P>A STILL &s;tronger argument, if po&s;&s;ible, may be brought from the &s;uperiority which wide &s;cience gives a young &s;tate&s;man; almo&s;t equal to that of experience it&s;elf. Nay, I even doubt, whether in this particular in&s;tance, learning doth not exceed experience as much as it falls below it in the practice of dome&s;tic life. For no &s;tate&s;man, let his age and practice be ever &s;o great, can from his proper experience, have &s;o much &s;kill in the incidents of government, as a man of &s;olid and extended &s;cience, to whom all climes and all ages are pre&s;ent. A mind without erudition may be bold and acute,
<PB N="154" REF="162">but cannot be va&s;t and powerful. By learning a man becomes an inhabitant of the world at large<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This idea is commonly expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>citizen of the world.</HI> Is the world a city?</NOTE>, and a cotemporary of all ages. The excellent author, above quoted, ob&s;erves el&s;e|where that books are like &s;hips which pa&s;s thro the va&s;t &s;eas of time, and make the mo&s;t di&s;tant ages to participate of the wi&s;dom, illumi|nations, and inventions, the one of the other. Shall we apply this beautiful figure to our pre&s;ent &s;ubject, and infer, how much &s;uperior mu&s;t that merchant be who deals upon &s;uch boundle&s;s &s;tores imported from all ages, and from all countries, to him who trades upon his own narrow home-&s;tock?</P>
<P>PRESCIENCE, which is &s;o great a quality in a &s;tate&s;man, is only acquirable by wide know|lege of the events of former ages. From that knowlege he may, in very many ca&s;es, foretell what will happen, and of con&s;equence u&s;e his prudence to guard again&s;t it. Very few acci|dents in political affairs are unique: the &s;eeds of mo&s;t of them have been &s;own in the wide field of univer&s;al nature; and they have pro|duced &s;imilar fruit, tho at remote periods.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="163">YOU will perceive that mo&s;t of the above reflections apply to that kind of erudition which is to be found in hi&s;tory, but above all in lives and memoirs. The&s;e may indeed be &s;aid to contain the &s;olid &s;cience of a &s;tate&s;man: but, if he wi&s;hes to be perfect, elegant literature hath likewi&s;e great utility. If a man hath, ambi|tion to aim at high rank in the &s;cale of govern|ment, nothing is &s;o likely to effect that end as eloquence: and Cicero hath &s;hewn, and indeed good &s;en&s;e mu&s;t convince us, that no man can be a great orator without a large and un|bounded fund of ideas. Such a fund is only to be acquired by &s;tudy, and by appropriation of the ideas of others. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of expanding the memory over the whole circle of knowlege.</P>
<P>I SHALL only further ob&s;erve, before I con|clude, that the great examples to be found in ancient hi&s;tory operate like electrical fire when they meet with congenial minds. The greate&s;t modern &s;tate&s;men have caught the flame of their in&s;piration from the altars which ancient Greece erected to honour and to virtue. And for the&s;e altars built by &s;olid &s;cience Greece
<PB N="156" REF="164">was indebted to Homer, who &s;tands fir&s;t in the cla&s;s of polite literature. From Homer Greece derived that &s;pirit which made her the wonder of other nations.

That a paltry corner of Europe &s;hould &s;tand fir&s;t in the rolls of fame, is &s;olely owing to thy divine genius!</P>

<P>IN the garden of &s;cience, as in other gardens, it co&s;ts more trouble to root out weeds than to plant flowers. I look upon the idea com|monly entertained by men of letters, in re&s;pect to Augu&s;tan ages, to be one of the&s;e weeds: and &s;hall here &s;hew you what may be done to root it out and de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>VELLEIUS PATERCULUS, an affected hi&s;to|rian, was the fir&s;t author of this fooli&s;h idea: which other writers have taken on tru&s;t, as u&s;ual, without &s;acrificing to common &s;en&s;e on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>WE are told by French critics, and you know that Mr. Addi&s;on, at the &s;ame time that he ridiculed our attention to French fa&s;hions, yet held up French critics, who are far wor&s;e, as worthy of all our reverence: I &s;ay we are told by French critics, that there have been
<PB N="159" REF="167">four Augu&s;tan ages, as they call them. The fir&s;t is that of Greece, in the time of Philip of Macedon, in which flouri&s;hed Socrates, Plato, Demo&s;thenes, Ari&s;totle, Apelles, Phidias, Praxi|teles, Thucydides, Xenophon, E&s;chylus, Euri|pides, Sophocles, Ari&s;tophanes, Menander, Phi|lemon. The &s;econd is that of Rome, under Augu&s;tus, near or under who&s;e reign flouri&s;hed Laberius, Catullus, Lucretius, Cicero, Livy, Virgil, Horace, Propertius, Tibullus, Ovid, Phaedrus, Vitruvius. The third is again that of Rome, after the revival of learning, and contains the names of Ario&s;to, Sannazaro, Guicciardini, Vida, Bembo, Sadolet, Macchia|vel, Michael Angelo, Raffaello, Tiziano. The fourth and la&s;t is that of France, under Louis XIV. in which &s;tand Corneille, Moliere, Ra|cine, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>NOW you mu&s;t ob&s;erve, my dear friend, that we are gravely told that genius was, during the&s;e ages, carried to its greate&s;t height in the&s;e re&s;pective countries. A remark of &s;uperlative futility. In the Augu&s;tan age of Greece, for example, where is the name of Homer, who flouri&s;hed about 300 years before? Where is
<PB N="160" REF="168">that of Plutarch, one of the greate&s;t writers that Greece produced, and alone worth ten of the&s;e Augu&s;tan authors, but who unhappily came more than 400 years after? In that of Rome where is Tacitus, almo&s;t their only ori|ginal writer? In the age of Leo X. where is Ta&s;&s;o, the fir&s;t of the Italian poets? Where Petrarca? Where Dante? Where Meta&s;ta&s;io? Is not Gre&s;&s;et yet living, one of the be&s;t writers France hath produced? Where is Buffon? Where poor Jean Jaques? Where Voltaire?</P>
<P>THE &s;uperior good &s;en&s;e and ob&s;ervation of the Engli&s;h hath taught them to &s;ix no Augu&s;|tan age for their country. May her Augu&s;tan age be a <HI>&s;aeculum &s;aeculorum!</HI> The names of Chaucer, of Shak&s;pere, of Milton, of Gray, are as remote as tho&s;e of Bacon and Newton: centuries elap&s;e between them. Nature, it would &s;eem, according to the <HI>inventers</HI> of the&s;e Augu&s;tan ages, illuminates other countries by con&s;tellations of petty &s;tars; but in Britain concentrates the rays of many into one, which dazzles her rival nations with <HI>a luxury of light.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="169">IN political events, my friend, I lately had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve that nature acts much in one way; they depend indeed upon the pa&s;&s;ions of mankind, which are always the &s;ame; and upon the rules of human prudence, which ad|mit of no great variation. But in re&s;pect to genius, which rules nature, and is not ruled by her, the ca&s;e is very different. True genius is as much above regulation in the period of his appearance, as in all his other attributes. And the principal writers of any country are as &s;el|dom &s;een together as eagles. They appear &s;ingle upon the wild and lo&s;ty rocks of genius ba&s;king in the noontide &s;un of fame.</P>

<P>AS I find my remarks on the la&s;t edition of Shak&s;pere were not di&s;plea&s;ing to you, I &s;hall now pre&s;ent you with &s;uch as have occurred on &s;ome of the other volumes.</P>
<P>Vol. IV. TWELFTH NIGHT. P. 190. <Q>Would you have a love &s;ong, or a &s;ong of good life?</Q> A &s;ong of good life means a pious ditty. The clown's que&s;tion is ironical.</P>
<P>P. 204. 'It is &s;illy &s;ooth.' Every boy knows this means, <HI>It is &s;illy in &s;ooth,</HI> It is of genuine &s;implicity.</P>
<P>P. 210. <HI>Mettle of India,</HI> the reading of the old copy is right. The <HI>mettle of India,</HI> the gold, is Shak&s;pere's. To the <HI>nettle</HI> his com|mentators are welcome.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="171">P. 215. The &s;quabble between the two wi&s;e commentators, about the meaning of Shak&s;pere's ob&s;cenity, is truly diverting. In other editions, an N is put among the other capitals, and makes one of the&s;e jokes in which Shak&s;pere appears but one of the people.</P>
<P>P. 261. It is &s;trange to &s;ee how the com|mentators have here mi&s;taken the clown's character, who &s;ays to Malvolio, <Q>Are you not mad indeed, or do you but counterfeit?</Q> They would fain make him talk &s;en&s;e. Shak|&s;pere made him talk non&s;en&s;e in character. The que&s;tion means, Are you really in your &s;en&s;es, or do you but act as tho you were? As tho a mad man could counterfeit a wi&s;e man! Ab&s;urd, but highly in character! Prai&s;es equally applicable to the annotators.</P>
<P>WINTER'S TALE, p. 385. Cadi&s;s, in Scotland, I am informed, &s;till means <HI>lint.</HI> Cadi&s;s is put upon a wound, is u&s;ed to &s;top holes in barrels, &amp;c. &amp;c.

<P><PB N="164" REF="172">MACBETH, Act I. Sc. I. The power of rai&s;|ing thunder was one of the imaginary preroga|tives of the&s;e imaginary beings, the witches. See <HI>Wierus de Prae&s;tigiis Daemonum:</HI> a &s;ingular author who had the merit of being the fir&s;t to di&s;credit the belief in witchcraft, and thereby to &s;ave the lives of many of his innocent deluded fellow creatures. Yet &s;uch was the frenzy of his age, that he actually pa&s;&s;ed for a magician, who had written with a view to defend the fraternity from condign puni&s;h|ment. True it is, that after his work, in order to di&s;credit the credulity of magic, he wrote a &s;mall treati&s;e containing the names of &s;ixty-eight daemon potentates, with directions for evoking them. <HI>O caecas hominum mentes!</HI></P>
<P>P. 447. 'From the nave to the chops,' implies, I doubt not, that Macbeth ripped the rebel up from the navel to the neck. At any rate, if we mu&s;t have non&s;en&s;e, that of Shak|&s;pere is preferable to that of his commentators at any time.</P>
<P>P. 447. 'Take my milk for gall.' That is, take my milk in&s;tead of the gall whereon
<PB N="165" REF="173">ye live, for my temperament is now replete with &s;uch diabolical bitterne&s;s that I might nurture daemons.</P>

<P>P 493. 'We&iuml;rd &s;i&s;ters.' Upon the fir&s;t ap|pearance of this word <HI>we&iuml;rd</HI> &s;hould have been given the following learned explanation from Mr. Ruddiman's Glo&s;&s;ary to Gavin Douglas's Virgil. <Q>WEIRD SISTERS, Parcae. Skinner derives it from the German <HI>werhen,</HI> to con|&s;ecrate. Some would rather bring it from <HI>word,</HI> as the Latin <HI>fatum</HI> comes from <HI>fari,</HI> and as the Latin <HI>dictio</HI> is frequently taken for <HI>the re&s;pon&s;e of an oracle, or God.</HI> It comes certainly from the Anglo Saxon &wyn;yrd, <HI>fate, fortune: Francice</HI> Urdi, <HI>fatum,</HI> &amp;c. and the&s;e again are mo&s;t probably from the Belgic and Teutonic <HI>werden,</HI> Anglo Saxon &wyn;eorthan, &amp;c. to <HI>come to pa&s;s.</HI> Becau&s;e fate, or de&s;tiny, mu&s;t

It was the cu&s;tom in the feudal ages to drink wine at going to bed.

<P>P. 521. 'What in our hou&s;e.' We are as much obliged to the commentators for giving us &s;uch notes as tho&s;e of Warburton on this place, as we are to Shak&s;pere for his &s;cenes of fools and madmen, inter&s;per&s;ed with pathetic ones.

<P>P. 558. What is the meaning of the phra&s;e <HI>Tho bladed corn be lodged.</HI> Does it imply <HI>tho corn ju&s;t bladed be blown fiat on the ground?</HI> Surely if it does, it forms a woeful anticlimax with the other image in this line, and <HI>trees blown down.</HI> Or does it mean a greater pro|digy, <HI>does the lodged corn &s;hew premature blades,</HI> by a tran&s;po&s;ition of the words not uncommon to Shak&s;pere?</P>
<P>BY the bye corn was, with the ancient Ro|mans, e&s;teemed a &s;pecial object of witchcraft or enchantment; witne&s;s this law of the Twelve Tables: <HI>Qui fruges excanta&s;&s;et, poenas dato; neve alienam &s;egetem pellexeris excantando; ne incantanto, ne agrum defruganto.</HI></P>
<P>P. 562. The &s;ublime apparition of the fu|ture kings, which has &s;uch a &s;trong theatrical effect, is, I think, founded on a pa&s;&s;age of Ari|o&s;to. See his &s;cene in Merlin's cave.</P>

<P>P. 287. 'Half-faced fellow&s;hip.' The image appears to me to be borrowed from coins, in which only half the countenance appears. Now countenance implies <HI>protection, per&s;onal friend&s;hip, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI> as well as <HI>the face.</HI> Witne&s;s the pun of a certain noble lord,

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>YOU remember well that the Abb&eacute; du Bos, one of the mo&s;t ingenious critics France has produced, if that be any prai&s;e, has, in his Reflections on Poetry and Painting, em|ployed many chapters to prove, that climate has a mo&s;t certain and immediate influence upon the human mind. His arguments I mu&s;t beg leave briefly to recapitulate, as I mean to &s;et them in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of a more emi|nent writer of our own; and &s;hall then offer you my own thoughts on this very curious &s;ubject, &s;ince you require them.</P>
<P>THE Abb&eacute;, in &s;upport of his opinion, fir&s;t produces a beautiful quotation from Fontenelle. 'Different ideas,' &s;ays that amiable writer, <Q>are as plants, and flowers, which do not grow equally in all climates. Perhaps our territory of France is as improper for the Egyptian modes of rea&s;oning, as for their palm-trees; and, without going &s;o far, perhaps the orange-trees,
<PB N="180" REF="188">which do not flouri&s;h here &s;o ea&s;ily as in Italy, denote that there is in Italy a certain turn of mind, which we have not in France. It is however certain, that by the reciprocal connection and dependence, that exi&s;ts among all the parts of the material world, the differ|ence of climate, perceivable in its effects upon plants, ought al&s;o to extend its influence to the powers of the human brain.</Q> This argu|ment, fanta&s;tic as it may appear, has more veri&s;imilitude than may at fir&s;t &s;ight be attri|buted to it. Certain it is, that the further natural philo&s;ophy proceeds, the more connec|tion is di&s;covered between plants and animals: and the mo&s;t eminent botani&s;ts have confe&s;&s;ed, that the &s;ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> plan of attaining to perfection in that &s;cience is, to allot to plants as much of the properties of animals as po&s;&s;ible; &s;uch as &s;leep, difference of &s;exes, and the preference of one nouri&s;hment or &s;oil to another.</P>
<P>TO proceed with the mo&s;t remarkable of the Abb&eacute;'s arguments. He attempts to &s;hew, that &s;ome countries have naturally given birth to arts without receiving them of others; &s;uch as Egypt, for in&s;tance; and he might have added
<PB N="181" REF="189">China; whereas, in others, &s;ome arts would ne|ver take root, tho planted by &s;overeign power, and nurtured by golden &s;howers of liberality. He in&s;tances painting in England; which, had he received a prophetical glimp&s;e of our days, he would have omitted.</P>
<P>MANY of his other arguments are tho&s;e of a man who wi&s;hes to go ingeniou&s;ly wrong: and I mu&s;t here beg leave to make one general re|mark mark on his work, naturally ari&s;ing from his arguments and quotations on this &s;ubject; which is, that the Abb&eacute; thro-out di&s;plays woeful ignorance of the Greek tongue and Greek writers; &s;carce one of which he even quotes, tho they bear the &s;ame proportional value to the Latin as gold doth to &s;ilver. Hence his admiration of Virgil, and his &s;eem|ing to forget that there is &s;uch a writer as Homer in the world: a defect utterly con|temptible, and unpardonable, in a writer who pretends to in&s;truct his readers in critical knowlege, and a due e&s;timate of works of literature. To return:</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="190">HE proceeds to &s;hew the power of climate upon genius, from the characters of nations: and, in the &s;ucceeding &s;ection, offers his an&s;wer to &s;uch objections as may be drawn from the characters of the Romans and the Dutch; &s;o entirely oppo&s;ite in ancient and modern times. His arguments are derived from the changes which nature hath made on the&s;e countries. In Rome, by the infection of the ancient <HI>cloacae;</HI> and, in Latium, from the want of cultivation, and the mar&s;hes not being kept drained, as in ancient times; or from the mines (he means <HI>&s;trata</HI>) of alum, &s;ulphur, and ar&s;enic, which nature hath been forming by degrees; and which exhale malignant vapours of power to affect both mind and body. 'We &s;ee frequently,' &s;ays he, <Q>in <HI>La Compagna de Roma,</HI> a phaeno|menen, which forces us to think that the attraction of the air is owing to the&s;e mines</Q> <HI>(&s;trata)</HI> <Q>formed near the &s;urface of the ground. During the heats, exhalations ari&s;e, which kindle of them&s;elves, and form long columns of flame. If the&s;e,</Q> he adds, <Q>had appeared in Livy's days, his hi&s;tory would have been full of the &s;acrifices offered for the expiation of &s;uch prodigies.</Q> The changes which na|ture
<PB N="183" REF="191">hath effected in Holland, lie in the de&s;truc|tion of her ancient fore&s;ts, now in many places di&s;coverable fifteen feet below the &s;urface of the earth; and the con&s;equent elevation of the ter|ritory.</P>
<P>IN the next &s;ection he &s;hews, by many inge|nious in&s;tances, that the difference of climates is, in many countries, owing to the difference of the emanations of their re&s;pective &s;oils; tho &s;uch countries are equally di&s;tant from the equinoctial line. Poland, for in&s;tance, varies from England; owing to the ground of the former being replete with &s;alt; that of the lat|ter with lead, tin, coals, and other minerals. The Abb&eacute; concludes his remarks on this &s;ub|ject by arguments, in another &s;ection, to &s;hew that the difference of talents in the &s;ame peo|ple, in different ages, is to be a&s;cribed to &s;ome variation of their climate. So much for Du Bos.</P>
<P>THE remarks of Monte&s;quieu, on the influ|ence of climate on mankind, I need not rehear&s;e, as they principally tend to &s;hew the influence of climate upon manners: an object quite di&s;|tinct from our pre&s;ent, which is the influence of climate upon the powers of the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="192">TO make the &s;cale even with the Abb&eacute; Du Bos, I &s;hall only recite a few ver&s;es of Mr. Gray, to be found in the fragment publi&s;hed of his admirable poem On the Alhance of Edu|cation and Government nece&s;&s;ary to produce <HI>great</HI> and u&s;eful men; his own words, and which, by the way, imply, that he con&s;idered climate as de&s;erving no notice, even in the production of great men, or men of genius.
<Q><L>Can opener &s;kies, and &s;uns of fiercer flame,</L>
<L>O'erpower the fire that animates our frame;</L>
<L>As lamps, that &s;hed at eve a chearful ray,</L>
<L>Fade and expire beneath the eye of day?</L>
<L>Need we the influence of the northern &s;tar,</L>
<L>To &s;tring our nerves, and &s;teel our hearts to war?</L>
<L>And where the face of nature laughs around,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t &s;ickening virtue fly the tainted ground?</L>
<L>Unmanly thought! What &s;ea&s;ons can control,</L>
<L>What fancied zone can circum&s;cribe the &s;oul?</L>
<L>Who, con&s;cious of the &s;ource from whence &s;he &s;prings,</L>
<L>By rea&s;on's light, on re&s;olution's wings,</L>
<L>Spite of her frail companion, dauntle&s;s goes</L>
<L>O'er Libya's de&s;erts, and thro Zembla's &s;nows?</L>
<L>She bids each &s;lumbering energy awake;</L>
<L>Another touch, another temper, take.</L>
<L>Su&s;pends th' inferior laws that rule our clay;</L>
<L>The &s;tubborn elements confe&s;s her &s;way.</L>
<L>Their little wants, their low de&s;ires, confine;</L>
<L>And raise the mortal to a height divine.</L></Q>
<PB N="185" REF="193">I believe, however, my dear friend, you will agree with me, that the truth, as u&s;ual, lies in the mid of the&s;e two extremes. That climate hath ab&s;olute power over genius, I will no more pronounce with Du Bos, than with Mr. Gray, that it hath none. In the utmo&s;t extremes of climate, in Greenland for in&s;tance, or in Zaara, &s;ome kinds of genius, I doubt not, may be found in perfection, &s;o far as adapted to the climate, &s;uch as the warlike, or the legi&s;lative; while others, &s;uch as the &s;peculative, the phi|lo&s;ophical, are totally heterogeneous to the &s;oil. When I &s;peak of legi&s;lative genius, as di&s;tinct from philo&s;ophical, I mean genius capable of forming laws for a community of no implex admini&s;tration: a Lycurgus, for in&s;tance, they may have; but not a Bacon. As to other climes, which are not in &s;uch extremes, we are led to think that the defect of genius in &s;ome countries, and the opulence of it in others, is owing more to education and government pro|ducing manners incompatible with the exer|tions of genius, or nutrition of &s;uch exertions; than to a trifling variation of <HI>the &s;kyey influence,</HI> as Shak&s;pere phra&s;es it. Certain it is, that large countries in A&s;ia, of equal or &s;uperior tempera|ture
<PB N="186" REF="194">of climate to any in Europe, have in no time produced men of equal genius. Europe hath indeed, for the&s;e three thou&s;and years, been the quarter of the world to which true and legitimate genius &s;eems confined. Even in poetry, which is the lea&s;t &s;ubject to climate of any exertion of genius, the A&s;iatics have, in all ages, been woefully inferior to the Europeans. In all ages, the poetry of the A&s;iatics has been &s;trained to bomba&s;t, and glittering with all the beauties of ab&s;urdity, from the mo&s;t ancient epoch down to our own times. As &s;everal cri|tics have of late &s;hewn a very different &s;enti|ment; with regard to holy writ in particular, which they, in their fondne&s;s of enthu&s;ia&s;m, would fain find as eminent in compo&s;ition as in &s;anctity, I mu&s;t beg leave to enforce my la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion a little; and &s;hall ea&s;ily &s;hew, that when they attempt to debauch our ta&s;te, by commenting on the beautiful and grand pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, they are forced to relin|qui&s;h every rule of &s;ound &s;en&s;e. To in&s;tance in a few of the mo&s;t noted pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>'LET there be light and there was light,' hath been &s;ung upon, <HI>u&s;que ad fa&s;tidium,</HI> owing
<PB N="187" REF="195">to a forged addition to Longinus, not to be found in any authentic MS. as Le Clerc hath &s;hewn; who likewi&s;e informs us, that this pa&s;|&s;age is a common barbari&s;m. A common bar|bari&s;m, I grant, may yet be &s;ublime: but did this pa&s;&s;age ever &s;trike any reader as &s;ublime till he read its illuminators? Certainly not. Fine &s;ublime that requires a label, like <HI>This is a bear</HI> of the bad painter, to point it out! Sub|lime that does not &s;trike at once, and &s;trike all, a&s;&s;umes that title fal&s;ely. <Q>Clothed his neck with thunder,</Q> I will venture to pronounce the mo&s;t con&s;ummate non&s;en&s;e that ever was clothed with the thunder of bomba&s;t. Had it been found in &s;ome Grub&s;treet writer of heroic panegyric, we &s;hould never have done laugh|ing at it. A hor&s;e wearing a neckcloth in battle, a neckcloth of thunder! <HI>Proh Deum at|qus hominum fidem!</HI> Dr. Blair, in his Lectures, who threatens in his preface to think for him|&s;elf, and who, I grant you, hath employed much thought about what he could pillage from his predece&s;&s;ors for his own u&s;e, very gravely tells us, Lect. XLI. that <Q>I&s;aiah de&s;cribes, with <HI>great maje&s;ty,</HI> the earth <HI>reeling to and fro like a drunkard, and removed like a cottage.</HI></Q> I &s;ee
<PB N="188" REF="196">you laugh: yet one or two in&s;tances more. The &s;ame writer, who thinks for him&s;elf, tells us, that the compari&s;on, 2 Sam. XXIII. 3. <Q>He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God; and he &s;hall be as the light of the morning, when the &s;un ri&s;eth; even a morning without clouds; as the tender gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the earth by clear &s;hining after rain,</Q> is one of the mo&s;t regular and formal in the &s;acred books. If &s;o, I wi&s;h him joy with all my heart. For my part, I likewi&s;e think for my&s;elf; and I &s;ee <HI>two &s;imiles</HI> in this pa&s;&s;age both totally <HI>unlike,</HI> informal and irregu|lar. But I am afraid of being tedious on a &s;ubject &s;o clear: and &s;hall return in ob&s;erving, that, for ab&s;urd and filthy imagery, witne&s;s &s;ome parts of Ezekiel, the be&s;t of the &s;acred writers, the &s;cripture yields to no compo&s;ition in any language; but of &s;ublime or beautiful &s;tyle, I can from that work produce no proofs. Writers who hold it up in that ludicrous view do as great harm to religion as to good ta&s;te: it re&s;embles the dre&s;&s;ing of a pious and worthy clergyman in the garments of a hero, or of a lovely woman; and then telling us he hath the &s;ublimity the one, and the beauty of the
<PB N="189" REF="197">other: whereas it only puts him in an aukward light; and brings deri&s;ion and contempt upon his holy character.</P>
<P>THE ea&s;tern writings are, to this day, re|markably deficient in that quality which we call good &s;en&s;e: and which mu&s;t reign, in an eminent degree, over works even of the warm|e&s;t fancy, if they are meant to plea&s;e the true judge. The nightingale's love for the ro&s;e, and all the other trite and ab&s;urd imagery of their be&s;t poetry, appear mere childi&s;hne&s;s to the &s;uperiority of European wi&s;dom. The vales of A&s;ia, it is true, teem with flowers, but they are &s;ickly, and of no duration: among the odorous fore&s;ts, that &s;pread fragrance over the ea&s;tern countries, the &s;trong oak of &s;en&s;e will not flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>CLIMATE, I conclude upon the whole, hath &s;ome power over genius; but not &s;o much as is a&s;cribed to it by &s;ome writers, nor &s;o little as is imputed by others. To attempt to mark the boundaries of its dominion, would be one of tho&s;e airy &s;peculations that &s;erve to di&s;play the writer's ingenuity at the expence of his wi&s;|dom.</P>

<P>AMONG the innumerable fooli&s;h books of memoirs, which the French little heroes of their own tales have produced, I be|lieve no mean rank in ab&s;urdity is due to tho&s;e of Cardinal De Retz.

O the pretty &s;tate&s;man! No lady could &s;ee him without loving him, becau&s;e he had fine teeth; as he tells us was ob&s;erved of him at court! He differs with Mazarine about nothing; and is feared before it was known that &s;uch a per&s;on exi&s;ted!</P>
<P>TO be &s;erious. The talents of De Retz are thought amazing, becau&s;e he had the mob of Paris at command; and his political knowledge thought &s;uperlative, becau&s;e he tells us, with all the pomp of maxim, that no mob can bear, <HI>&s;e de&s;heurer,</HI> to lo&s;e a meal; for this la&s;t is the only political axiom of his that I have &s;een taken notice of. To have a mob at command is no proof of talents, as a late occa&s;ion mu&s;t convince us: that occa&s;ion mu&s;t likewi&s;e &s;hew the futility of the axiom above recited.</P>
<P>IF ever there was a &s;uperficial egoti&s;t, who had knavery ju&s;t enough to &s;ave him from being a fool; who tells &s;uch lyes from mere vanity, as carry confutation in them&s;elves, not
<PB N="192" REF="200">to &s;peak of the reprobative te&s;timony of co|temporaries; who is always the hero of a tale of a cock and a bull; it is De Retz.

<P>IN the Menagiana, we are informed, that De Retz u&s;ed to tell a &s;tory of his having &s;een a man catch hold of the vane of a windmill, go round on it, and alight on the &s;pot of ground from which he had &s;et out. This wi&s;e tale, which I &s;uppo&s;e is another in&s;tance of his political talents, always &s;truck me as a mo&s;t ju&s;t emblem of the Cardinal him&s;elf. He caught hold of a vane of the populary windmill; took a round; and was ju&s;t where he was; &s;aving that the height and rotation had &s;uch an effect upon his brain as he never got the better of, but ever after &s;poke and wrote like a vi&s;ionary oracle.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>FARCE is no &s;uch modern invention as you imagine. On the contrary, it is, I have no doubt, the mo&s;t ancient of theatrical exhibitions. Nor is pantomime much more modern. As I know you pique your&s;elf more upon u&s;ing your own &s;en&s;e than that of others; upon elegant knowlege, than upon erudition; I hope &s;ome little di&s;qui&s;ition upon this point will prove an agreeable amu&s;ement to you.</P>
<P>CASAUBON, in his very learned treati&s;e on the Satyrical Poetry of the Greeks and that of the Romans, has well e&s;tabli&s;hed a very remote di&s;tinction between the <HI>&s;atires</HI> of the two na|tions. Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t were little pieces or farces, repre&s;ented on the &s;tage. Tho&s;e of the latter were a &s;pecies of poetry quite di&s;tant from &s;uch repre&s;entation; being merely moral poems, mingled with invective again&s;t vice and vicious characters. One in&s;tance only of the former is pre&s;erved in the Cyclops of Euripi|des: examples of the la&s;t may be &s;een in the writings of Horace, of Juvenal, of Per&s;ius.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="202">TO proceed with the former, which is the object of our pre&s;ent enquiry, the &Sgr;&Agr;&Tgr;&Ugr;&Rgr;&Igr;&Kgr;&Agr;, or Farces, of the Greeks, were the invention of their fe&s;tival days in&s;tituted in honour of the gods: for that wi&s;e and gay people rightly imagined, that the joy of man is the &s;upreme prai&s;e of the Deity. Tzetzes tells us the&s;e en|tertainments were the invention of rude ru&s;tics; by which Ca&s;aubon under&s;tands that their origin is to be a&s;cribed to the mo&s;t ancient age; before towns were built, or civil &s;ociety e&s;tabli&s;hed. That the &Sgr;&Agr;&Tgr;&Ugr;&Rgr;&Igr;&Kgr;&Agr;, is the mo&s;t ancient &s;pecies of dramatic writing, we have the au|thority of Ari&s;totle him&s;elf, who tells us that the choru&s;es of ancient tragedy are borrowed from them: <GAP DESC="foreign">. A circum&s;tance not attended to by any of our critical writers, who univer&s;ally look on the choru&s;es as the original parts of tragedy, being at fir&s;t &s;ongs in honour of the deities, to which dialogue was added by de|grees. How long will our Engli&s;h critics dully follow the French; and tread always in the paths of each other, for fear of being lo&s;t in a &s;earch after the original fountains of know|lege? The&s;e &s;atires of the Greeks were &s;o
<PB N="195" REF="203">called from their actors, who per&s;onified the Satyrs, the imaginary attendants of Bacchus, at who&s;e fe&s;tivals they were originally per|formed; whereas the Latin Satyrae are derived from <HI>&s;atur, full,</HI> as replete with variety of matter. For we mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the ancient Roman Satyrae were not continued invectives again&s;t vice, but &s;ometimes treated the advan|tages of virtue, and the like, in an ethic and &s;evere tone. Such is Ca&s;aubon's etymology: but why may not the Roman <HI>&s;atyrae,</HI> or <HI>&s;aturae</HI> as more anciently written, be derived from <HI>Saturn,</HI> the deity at who&s;e fe&s;tivals the fa&s;|cenine ver&s;es, the rude &s;ketches of the Roman &s;atire, were chiefly recited?</P>
<P>TO return to the Greek farces. Their origin and etymology have been &s;hewn: now for their &s;ubject. In this they differed totally from our farces, that they admitted of tragic &s;ub|jects; nay the mo&s;t ancient of them knew no other. Yet the&s;e &s;ubjects were not completely tragic; but allowed of a mixture of comic &s;cenes, even in tho&s;e that bore the hue of tra|gedy. They were in fact &s;hort tragicomedies. Mr. Addi&s;on, with his u&s;ual French &s;uperfici|ality
<PB N="196" REF="204">of &s;cience, tells us, that tragicomedy is the mon&s;trous product of the Engli&s;h &s;tage. It was known to his admired ancients, both Greeks and Romans; as he might have known, had he read Athenaeus, with regard to the former; or the prologue to the Amphitryon of Plautus, for we &s;hall not expect that he would read the piece it&s;elf, with regard to the latter. By both nations it was applauded and admired. And Shak&s;pere alone might convince us, that it is the mo&s;t natural, and con&s;equently the mo&s;t proper way, of con&s;tructing a drama, tho not the mo&s;t &s;afe or artificial; as requiring far greater powers in the writer than when one turn of &s;entiment is begun and continued from the beginning to the end of a piece.</P>
<P>UNHAPPILY the only &s;pecimen we have of the Greek farce is in the tragic &s;tyle; but from it we may judge of the others; for even in this the &s;hocking &s;tory of Ody&s;&s;es, or Uly&s;&s;es, and the Cyclops, is apparently treated in &s;uch a ludicrous way as to produce the complete effect of Tom Thumb, Chrononhotonthologos, or the like mock tragedies. If &s;uch were the tragic farces, the comic ones mu&s;t have &s;uper|abounded
<PB N="197" REF="205">with broad humour and laughter. The humour I however judge from the per|&s;ons, a mob of drunken &s;atyrs, mu&s;t have been very impure: and &s;u&s;pect that the decency of the Cyclops of Euripides is the great rea&s;on of its being pre&s;erved in preference to &s;o many others.</P>
<P>CASAUBON hath on this &s;ubject crouded his trea&s;ures, drawn from the very depths of Greek and Roman erudition, with great profu&s;ion. The learning he di&s;plays on this very curious &s;ubject amazes even the learned. I &s;hall not, however, attempt to &s;tring any more of his pearls; but content my&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that in his long enumeration of eminent Greek writers of farce, are the names of The&s;pis, Ae&s;chylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Plato, Lyco|phron, Bion.</P>
<P>AT what time the moderns thought of annexing farces to larger dramatic pieces, in order to diver&s;ify the entertainment, I will not take upon me to determine; but &s;uppo&s;e the practice was not e&s;tabli&s;hed in England till the Re&s;toration. Among other cu&s;toms borrowed
<PB N="198" REF="206">from France, I take this to have been one. The word <HI>farce</HI> is originally Latin, I &s;uppo&s;e, from <HI>farcire, to fill, to &s;tuff;</HI> alluding to its filling the entertainment, and rendering it complete. Like other Latin words, it has pa&s;&s;ed to us thro the channel of France; but is not, in my opinion, from the French <HI>farcer, to play the droll:</HI> I rather think that verb is from the &s;ub|&s;tantive, as we may &s;ay <HI>to make a farce of a thing.</HI></P>
<P>THE ancient farces, as hath been already ob&s;erved on another occa&s;ion, were very com|monly performed between the acts of their tragedies or comedies; as ballets are now danced between the acts of operas. By the bye, one cannot help laughing at Mr. Addi&s;on's better attack upon the opera, and his profe&s;&s;ed admiration of the ancient dramas. The opera is a complete copy of the ancient drama, in all its parts of recitation and &s;ong, accompanied with mu&s;ic and dance: a formal chorus, it is true, is not now introduced; but the actors them&s;elves form the &s;inging chorus, in a way much more natural and proper; and for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> another province of the ancient chorus
<PB N="199" REF="207">unknown to its modern wellwi&s;hers, a real and di&s;tinct chorus of ballet dancers is pre&s;erved in all its lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>THE modern farces are with more propriety brought forward at the clo&s;e of more important dramas; and are particularly nece&s;&s;ary after tragedy, to relieve the mind, and prevent our &s;orrows, ari&s;ing from fiction, to enter into real life, where too many real &s;orrows await us.</P>
<P>IT is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to add, that in many of our farces are to be found &s;ome of the &s;tronge&s;t comic &s;ituations, and the mo&s;t genuine wit and humour that grace our &s;tage. In our farce we allow more latitude of plot, broader humour, and higher colour of charac|ter, than in comic dramas of a greater denomi|nation. Comedy, tho &s;he ought always to be chearful, is generally content merely to &s;imper and &s;mile; whereas Farce ought always to laugh aloud. To the eminent names of Greek writers of farce, mentioned above, the Engli&s;h may add tho&s;e of Fielding, Garrick, Smollet, Colman.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="208">HAVING &s;poken &s;o much of farce, let us now con&s;ider pantomime. The prodigious e&s;timation in which this art and its profe&s;&s;ors were held by the ancients, appears from innu|merable te&s;timonies of their authors. To quote two or three of them were ridiculous; for one cannot open an ancient who takes any notice of, or derives any metaphor from the theatre, without ob&s;erving the important light in which they con&s;idered pantomime. Nor &s;hall we wonder at this, when we remark the high perfection to which the ancients had carried this art. By the ge&s;tures merely of the panto|mimic actors were the ancient audiences infi|nitely more affected either with tragic or comic &s;en&s;ations, than with all the dramatic pomp of mu&s;ical declamation and &s;ympathetic force of recitative. If you wi&s;h more information on this head, peru&s;e Lucian's treati&s;e "On Panto|mime."</P>
<P>THE further &s;outh we go, the more do people u&s;e ge&s;ture, and the more are they affected by it. A Frenchman u&s;es infinitely more ge&s;ticulation than an Engli&s;hman; and an Italian &s;till more than a Frenchman. Hence
<PB N="201" REF="209">Italy has always been the proper climate of pantomime. In ancient and in modern days, the <HI>&s;annio,</HI> or <HI>harlequin,</HI> with all his brethren of grimace, have cho&s;en Italy for their chief theatre of action. Italy has, both in ancient and modern times, been the inventre&s;s of ludi|crous pantomime; and I &s;u&s;pect al&s;o of &s;erious, which now only exi&s;ts in the grand ballets of the opera, lately brought almo&s;t to ancient perfection and pathos by Noverre. Magnifi|cence in particular, the grand character of the ancient &s;tage, is, in the&s;e ballets, or modern &s;erious pantomimes, carried to a greater height than in any other theatrical exhibition of the&s;e times.</P>
<P>BUT it is the pantomime of the Engli&s;h &s;tage that now draws our attention. The con|tempt expre&s;&s;ed for this expen&s;ive amu&s;ement, by &s;ome men of &s;evere&s;t wi&s;dom, is it&s;elf con|temptible. No amu&s;ement de&s;erves &s;corn that is an innocent relaxation from anxious thoughts and the cares of life. No dramatic exhibition excites le&s;s thought, or more ocular attention, than pantomime; none is of con&s;equence more calculated for the man of &s;tudy, or of care.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="210">IT may however be regretted, that the &s;ums expended in Grecian days, to place their grand tragic &s;cenes in an exuberance of decoration, are now wa&s;ted on this inferior performance. The magnificence of unmeaning proce&s;&s;ions, &amp;c. in pre&s;ent pantomimes is amazing. The managers of the winter theatres commonly produce a pantomime in the cour&s;e of every &s;ea&s;on; and rival each other in this annual extravagance with the profu&s;ion of two rich peers contending for the return of members of parliament. The&s;e pantomimes are commonly brought forward during the Chri&s;tmas holi|days, when all the world is idle; and the con|&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of them &s;hews that the mana|gers do not form their ne&s;t-eggs of gold, to u&s;e a metaphor Hudibra&s;tic, without making their clients lay in proportion.</P>
<P>INDEED pantomime is now the be&s;t enter|tainment we find in our theatres. It is quite a&s;toni&s;hing to remark how much our &s;tage hath declined within this half dozen years, &s;ince the retreat of Garrick. It is overwhelmed with floods of Iri&s;h non&s;en&s;e, and &s;tuff more &s;tupid than &s;tupidity, where not one glimmer of &s;en&s;e
<PB N="203" REF="211">or wit appears. Had tho&s;e Iri&s;hmen, female &s;criblers, &amp;c. offered their tra&s;h to a Bartholo|mew-fair audience a few years ago, they would have been hi&s;&s;ed to &s;corn. Our poor audiences &s;it with Dutch phlegm, and take what God &s;ends. Engli&s;h good nature, or <HI>bon hommie,</HI> if you plea&s;e, puts us upon a level with the mo&s;t &s;tupid and barbarous of nations. What the judgement of our audiences condemns, their <HI>good nature</HI> with a vengeance! comes in and reprieves at the very gallows. However it is &s;ome con&s;olation to know that our &s;tage cannot po&s;&s;ibly be wor&s;e than it is, &s;o it mu&s;t mend of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>CHANGE of &s;cene was totally unknown to the ancients: in this mute di&s;play they mu&s;t therefore have yielded to the wonderful me|chani&s;m of modern times. The mechanic wit of modern pantomime is tran&s;cendant; a law|yer is changed into a lady of Billing&s;gate, and a judge into an owl, in a moment. With regard to the dignity of amu&s;ement, I &s;uppo&s;e our comic pantomime yields not to that of the ancients; for Plutarch tells us, in his Sympo|&s;iacs, that dogs regularly bred to the &s;tage per|formed
<PB N="204" REF="212">parts in the ancient pantomime; a per|fection to which we have not yet arrived.</P>
<P>THE modern harlequin is a perfect copy of the ancient <HI>&s;annio,</HI> or <HI>mimus.</HI> The <HI>mimus</HI> had his face &s;meared with &s;oot, <HI>fuligine faciem obductus,</HI> and wore a habit patched of many colours; as we learn from Apuleius in his Apology, <HI>Quid enim &s;i choragium thimelicum po&s;&s;iderem? Num ex eo argumentavere etiam uti me con&s;uevi&s;&s;e Tragaedi &s;yrmate, Hi&s;trionis crocota,</HI> Mimi centunculo? The <HI>centunculus</HI> is a dimi|nutive of <HI>cento</HI> u&s;ed by Juvenal for a garment made of patches; whence it is applied metapho|rically to a poem compo&s;ed of &s;hreds of others; as the noted <HI>cento</HI> of Au&s;onius.</P>
<P>THE other pantomimic per&s;ons of our theatre are Columbine, Pantaloon, and the Clown. The Italians have likewi&s;e The Doc|tor, Beltrame of Milan, Scapin, The Italian Captain, The Spani&s;h Captain, Scaramouche, Giangurgulo the Calabrian, Mezzetin, Tartag|lia, Punch, Narci&s;in de Malabergo. A grand pantomime, including all the Italian per&s;onages in their proper characters, is yet wanting to the Engli&s;h &s;tage.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXX.</HEAD>
<P>I DO not wonder that the prai&s;es which Dr. Blackwall hath be&s;towed on Gravina's work, DELLA RAGION POETICA, together with the uncommon title of the work it&s;elf, have excited your curio&s;ity. The book is rather rare, tho of no great price; and till I can procure you a copy, accept a &s;hort account of it.</P>
<P>IT is divided into two books, and addre&s;&s;ed <HI>A Madama Colbert Principe&s;&s;a di Carpegna;</HI> an impropriety &s;imilar to that of De Retz, in addre&s;&s;ing a work to a per&s;on who could never be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand it. Was the patro|ne&s;s the daughter or niece of the great Colbert? He mentions her ance&s;tors as being of Scot|land, and pa&s;&s;ing into France. By the bye, the Scoti&s;h name is Cuthbert; and Mr. Cuthbert of Ca&s;tlehill, an old Scoti&s;h title, a&s;&s;umes, as I am informed by different countrymen of his, the name of L'Abb&eacute; Colbert, when at Paris, where he hath fixed his re&s;idence.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="214">IN this addre&s;s there is nothing remarkable, &s;ave a very ju&s;t remark, which, tho made like|wi&s;e by Pope, is not, and never will be, &s;uffi|ciently attended to; namely, <Q>that there is equal difficulty in judging perfectly well of poetry, as in compo&s;ing with perfection: and that it is far ea&s;ier to be a middling author than a ju&s;t critic.</Q> He proceeds, in the addre&s;s, to &s;hew the de&s;ign upon which his work is written; and what he under&s;tands by the title of it, DELLA RAGION POETICA, <HI>Of the Rea&s;ons or fir&s;t Cau&s;es of Poetry;</HI> and ob|&s;erves, that as every noble edifice is built ac|cording to the rules of architecture, and the&s;e rules have geometry for their <HI>ragion,</HI> or fir&s;t cau&s;e; &s;o the knowlege of poetry is the <HI>ragion</HI> or foundation of the rules of poetry. He then proceeds to &s;hew the true knowlege of poetry to con&s;i&s;t in an eternal idea of fitne&s;s of things; and, in the fifteen or &s;ixteen &s;ucceeding &s;ections, utterly lo&s;es him&s;elf in the Platonic &s;y&s;tem; on which a man of great mind, who gives him&s;elf up to erudition, is &s;o apt to be wrecked. Platoni&s;m was indeed the madne&s;s of Gravina, as appears from all his works: and an attach|ment to an enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;y&s;tem is the grand rea|&s;on
<PB N="207" REF="215">why the works of the ma&s;ter of Meta&s;ta&s;io have been &s;o little read.</P>
<P>FROM this account of the leading idea of his work, you will at fir&s;t glance perceive that the fabric re&s;ts upon &s;and. Nothing indeed can well be more futile, nor of fal&s;er critici&s;m, than to infer an analogy between geometry, the colde&s;t operation of the judgement, and poetry, the warme&s;t exertion of the imagina|tion. The fact is, that the rules of poetry have no <HI>ragion,</HI> as he quaintly and ab&s;tractedly calls it, but the example of former poets. I beg par|don for the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>rules of poetry.</HI> Poetry knows no rules. The code of laws which Genius pre&s;cribes to his &s;ubjects, will ever re&s;t in their own bo&s;oms. <HI>Rules of critici&s;m</HI> was the expre&s;&s;ion I meaned to u&s;e; and the&s;e have no <HI>ragion,</HI> or fir&s;t foundation, at all. They are drawn from Homer, Sophocles, and Pindar: what the&s;e ma&s;ters do, &s;ay the critics, is right, and every thing el&s;e is wrong. Poor judges! Ye &s;laves who judge of your ma&s;ters! Is not NATURE greater than Homer, Sophocles, or Pindar? Is not GENIUS the &s;upreme arbiter and lord of Nature's whole domain; her &s;uperior,
<PB N="208" REF="216">her king, her god? Bring out your candle then, and teach the &s;un how to exert his meri|dian power!</P>
<P>IN the&s;e fir&s;t, fifteen &s;ections, there are, neverthele&s;s, &s;ome remarks worth notice; &s;uch as this, <Q>we mu&s;t &s;tudy diligently to impre&s;s upon ver&s;e an appearance of negligence; that the imagination may not revolt from its delu|&s;ion, thro the force of apparent artifice.</Q> That upon the native gravity of the Romans is curi|ous; and he a&s;cribes to this the defect of Latin comedy. He ob&s;erves, in another place, that Terence hath no comic force; and that Volcatius Sedigitus, an ancient critic, placed Terence only in the &s;ixth rank even of Roman comic writers; yet his works, and tho&s;e of Virgil, have reached us. Such is the power of &s;tyle!</P>
<P>MANY of his ob&s;ervations upon Homer are fine; &s;uch as, his being the greate&s;t poet, be|cau&s;e his works all bear the very &s;tamp of na|ture; none of his characters being perfect; the virtuous being painted as capable of vice, and the vicious as guilty of virtue. Perfect cha|racters
<PB N="209" REF="217">form indeed a &s;ure mark of a middling writer; who cannot copy nature, but only a feeble idea of perfection in his own brea&s;t. They are always in&s;ipid; witne&s;s Eneas, the mo&s;t in&s;ipid character ever drawn; for the vices of Eneas, his dereliction of Dido, &amp;c. are not de&s;cribed as imperfections of character; but are indeed mere incon&s;i&s;tencies.</P>
<P>HIS idea of the theology, and philo&s;ophic &s;y&s;tem of Homer, I look upon as without foun|dation. Homer, I am certain, had no allegory whatever in view, when he wrote either of his immortal poems: his only intention was to entertain; and, perhaps, to make money, by furni&s;hing amu&s;ement to others. Let us not look upon the la&s;t motive as &s;ordid: it was the motive of Shak&s;pere. I know of no book whatever that may not be turned into an alle|gory, with the help of a &s;mattering analogy, which the meane&s;t fancy is capable of forming. Alchymy has been found in the Hypneroma|chia of Poliphilo in all its &s;ecrets; and I doubt not might likewi&s;e be di&s;covered by an adept in the Iliad, or in the Ody&s;&s;ey. They who find any thing in the&s;e poems more than the
<PB N="210" REF="218">entertaining narration of an intere&s;ting &s;tory, are methodi&s;ts in poetry; and have as great a title to the inward light, which always comes thro a crack in the &s;kull, as the methodi&s;ts in religion.</P>
<P>AFTER e&s;caping the&s;e fifteen &s;ections of Platonic frenzy, we happily arrive at his cha|racters of the mo&s;t eminent poets of ancient Greece and Rome; who have all, according to the author's enthu&s;ia&s;tic theory, written up to his idea of making all poetry a my&s;tic veil of Platoni&s;m. He however doth not always harp upon the &s;tring of his madne&s;s; and when he doth not, his characters of the &s;everal ancient poets are admirably ju&s;t and fine.</P>
<P>HE concludes the fir&s;t book with characters of the modern Latin poets of Italy, after &s;ew|ing them to his &s;y&s;tem by a coar&s;e thread of di&s;cour&s;e; for he tells us, that there is now no occa&s;ion for my&s;tici&s;m in poetry, it being the fa&s;hion for truth to appear without any cover|ing. As I hold modern Latin poetry in utter contempt, I need not tell you, that I agree with him in no one character of any of its au|thors.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="219">IN the &s;econd book he returns to his Pla|toni&s;m with fre&s;h vigour in character&s;ing Dante, on whom he dwells thro many &s;ec|tions. He afterwards proceeds to value the other Italian poets, mo&s;tly with great ju&s;tice and acutene&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS is, I believe, an accurate analy&s;is of Gravina's celebrated performance, <HI>Della Ragion Poetica:</HI> a work, which, tho written by a man of fine ta&s;te and ample talents, is yet only a monument of the pernicious effects of &s;y&s;tem upon any &s;cience. Lord Bacon hath ob&s;erved that any faculty reduced to an art mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity become barren, becau&s;e art circum&s;cribes it: as for in&s;tance, no good poetry can be writ|ten by an author who pays the &s;malle&s;t atten|tion to arts of poetry. Which <HI>arts</HI> of poetry are indeed, in my opinion, &s;o many contradic|tions in terms; for poetry is a faculty, not an art: an exertion of the mind to be circum|&s;cribed by rules, only when &s;ome wonderful inventor &s;hall teach watches to think; there being fully as much ab&s;urdity in the idea of giving mechani&s;m to thought, as in that of giving thought to mechani&s;m. The remark of
<PB N="212" REF="220">Lord Bacon, above quoted, may ju&s;tly be applied to &s;y&s;tem: with attachment to which if a writer is tainted, he can never acquire wide and la&s;ting fame; which is only to be attained by the productions of a &s;oul free as the mountain winds, and large as the univer&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>OF the numerous writers on truth, I know none who hath yet ob&s;erved that the truth perceivable to human rea&s;on may be reduced to two kinds, truth of fact and truth of nature.</P>
<P>BEFORE I proceed further, allow me to tell you an anecdote.</P>
<P>SIR WALTER RALEGH, when confined in the Tower, had prepared the &s;econd volume of his immortal hi&s;tory for the pre&s;s. He was &s;tanding at the window of his apartment, ru|minating on the office of an hi&s;torian, and on the &s;acred regard which he ought to pay to truth, when of a &s;udden his attention was ex|cited by an uproar in the court, into which his pro&s;pect was directed. He &s;aw one man &s;trike another, whom by his dre&s;s he judged an officer, and who drawing his &s;word run the a&s;&s;ailant thro the body; who did not however fall till he had knocked down the officer with
<PB N="214" REF="222">his fi&s;t. The officer was in&s;tantly &s;eized, while lying &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and carried away by the &s;er|vants of ju&s;tice; while at the &s;ame time the body of the man he had murdered was borne off by &s;ome per&s;ons, apparently his friends, who, with great difficulty, pierced thro the va&s;t croud that was now gathered around.</P>
<P>NEXT day an acquaintance of Sir Walter called on him; a man, of who&s;e &s;evere probity and honour, Sir Walter was convinced from innumerable proofs, and rated his friend&s;hip accordingly. Ralegh, after their fir&s;t compli|ments, told the &s;tory of ye&s;terday's fray; which had impre&s;&s;ed him deeply, as being a &s;pectator of the whole affair. What was his &s;urprize, when his friend told him that he was perfectly mi&s;taken in his whole &s;tory! That his officer was no officer, but a &s;ervant of a foreign am|ba&s;&s;ador; that this apparent officer gave the fir&s;t blow: that he did not draw his &s;word, but the other drew it, and it was wre&s;ted out of his hands, but not till after he had run its owner thro the body with it: that after this, a foreigner in the mob knocked the murderer down, in order that he &s;hould not e&s;cape: that
<PB N="215" REF="223">&s;ome foreigners had carried off the &s;ervant's body: and that orders had arrived from court for the murderer to be tried in&s;tantly, and no favour &s;hewn, as the per&s;on murdered was one of the principal attendants of the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador. 'Sir,' &s;ays Ralegh, <Q>allow me to &s;ay that, tho I may be mi&s;taken as to the officer&s;hip of the murderer, yet I know of a certainty, that all my other circum&s;tances are &s;trictly true; be|cau&s;e I was a &s;pectator of the whole tran&s;ac|tion, which pa&s;&s;ed on that very &s;pot oppo&s;ite, where you &s;ee a &s;tone of the pavement a little rai&s;ed above the re&s;t.</Q> 'Sir Walter,' &s;ays the friend, <Q>upon that very &s;tone did I &s;tand dur|ing the whole affair, and received this little &s;cratch in my cheek, in wre&s;ting the &s;word out of the fellow's hand: and as I &s;hall an&s;wer to God, you are totally mi&s;taken.</Q> <Q>You grow warm, my friend, let us talk of other matters,</Q> &s;aid Sir Walter; and, after &s;ome other conver&s;ation, his friend departed.</P>
<P>RALEGH took up the manu&s;cript of the &s;econd volume of his hi&s;tory, then ju&s;t com|pleted; 'How many fal&s;ehoods are here?' &s;aid he. <Q>If I cannot judge of the truth of an event
<PB N="216" REF="224">that pa&s;&s;es under my eyes, how &s;hall I truly narrate tho&s;e which have pa&s;&s;ed thou&s;ands of years before my birth; or even tho&s;e that have happened &s;ince my exi&s;tence? Truth, I &s;acrifice to thee!</Q> The fire was already feed|ing on his invaluable work, the labour of years: and he calmly &s;at till it was utterly con&s;umed, and the table gho&s;t of the la&s;t leaf flitted up the chimney.</P>
<P>FROM this anecdote I illu&s;trate an opinion, which I have always held, that there is no &s;uch thing as truth of fact, or hi&s;torical truth, known to man. Hi&s;tory is merely a species of romance, founded on events which really hap|pened; but the bare events as &s;tated by chro|nologi&s;ts are alone true; their cau&s;es, circum|&s;tances, and effects, as detailed by hi&s;torians, depend entirely on the fancy of the relater. Or other truths none are po&s;itive to man, &s;ave tho&s;e &s;ubject to his &s;en&s;es; and even the&s;e are fallac ous, tho the truths they affirm are po&s;i|tive, <HI>as to us:</HI> to &s;uperior beings our truths are no doubt fal&s;ehoods.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="225">FROM this ob&s;ervation, however, a certain &s;pecies of truth, which con&s;i&s;ts in the relation and connection of things, mu&s;t be exempted; providing this may be called po&s;itive truth. I mean, truth of nature, or that univer&s;al truth to be found in poetry and works of fiction. This con&s;i&s;ts in the propriety and con&s;i&s;tence of event, of character, of &s;entiment, of lan|guage, to be found in &s;uch works. Want of &s;uch propriety and con&s;i&s;tence always &s;trikes even a common reader as <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and ab&s;urd. Were Achilles, in&s;tead of fighting Hector, to fall on his knees, and beg for his life, the inci|dent would &s;trike every one as contrary to <HI>truth</HI> of character. I need not u&s;e any more in&s;tances to illu&s;trate my meaning; tho I doubt you will think it rather an uncommon remark, that the whole truth known to man, and not &s;ubject to his &s;en&s;es, mu&s;t be found only in works of fiction. Truth was not made for man, nor man for truth. He is the mere crea|ture of fal&s;ehood: on fal&s;ehood depend his being, his pa&s;&s;ions, his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>BY the truth of nature, you will perceive, I mean that repre&s;ented and imitated by art.
<PB N="218" REF="226">For when we &s;ay that an event or character drawn by a painter or poet is not <HI>true,</HI> is not <HI>in nature,</HI> we imply that art hath relinqui&s;hed nature: art and nature are therefore, in this in&s;tance, almo&s;t &s;ynonymous terms; for we refer the repre&s;entations of art to that idea of univer&s;al nature, which every mind acquires, in a greater or &s;maller degree, from being daily conver&s;ant in her works.</P>
<P>A CHARACTER may however be drawn out of the u&s;ual progre&s;s of nature, and yet have truth; as the Caliban of Shak&s;pere. In this, fancy, comparing certain ideas of utter rude|ne&s;s of human nature, blended with the be&s;tial and demonic: the two fir&s;t drawn from real nature; the latter from a continuity of &s;imilar notions of the&s;e &s;upernatural beings, handed down from ages of ignorance to ages of refine|ment, compo&s;es, from uniting the&s;e ideas, a certain &s;tandard of fitne&s;s and propriety of character, which is here applied in&s;tead of the grand &s;tandard of nature. This &s;ingular cha|racter is <HI>true to it&s;elf,</HI> offends no idea of pro|priety, yet is not in nature.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="227">OF truth of nature, taken in a large &s;en&s;e as applicable to the grand works of nature, man can only judge in &s;o far as tho&s;e concern him. It is the nature of the &s;un to produce heat, but, were it in time to po&s;&s;e&s;s the oppo&s;ite quality, we could not &s;ay that <HI>nature was fal&s;e,</HI> but that her effects varied. Were we told that the rays of the &s;un are e&s;&s;entially cold, but have the power to effect heat, we cannot prove the propo&s;ition wrong; we only judge from our feelings that the &s;un warms us: and the wi&s;dom that would go further is folly; for any prerogative of nature that manife&s;ts not its ex|i&s;tence to us, we may boldly &s;ay, hath no exi&s;t|ence. The Her&s;chelian planet certainly did not exi&s;t to us till it was di&s;covered, tho it was ever an attendant of our &s;y&s;tem. How fit we are to judge of the truth of the works of na|ture, may be inferred from the &s;ermon of the Cordelier, who de&s;ired his audience to admire the &s;uperlative wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God, who always makes the greate&s;t rivers to pa&s;s, by the greate&s;t cities.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR wonder at my a&s;&s;ertion, that the modern &s;tage and drama are &s;uperior to the ancient, I can only remove by &s;upporting it with evidence. To begin with the theatre; that of the ancients con&s;i&s;ted, like ours, of a &s;emicircle, of which the chord for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the &s;tage, behind which were convenience for the actors; and the &s;emicircular part contained &s;eats for the &s;pectators. The ancient &s;tage of the Greeks comprehended four divi&s;ions: the <GAP DESC="foreign">, where the reciters of the play &s;tood; the <GAP DESC="foreign">, where the actors of the play were &s;tationed; the <GAP DESC="foreign">, where the chorus was placed to dance and &s;ing; and the <GAP DESC="foreign">, where, as with us, the mu&s;icians held their re&s;idence. The &s;cene was always the &s;ame for each kind of drama. The tragedy had a &s;cene con&s;i&s;ting of a view of a public place, as the court of a palace, or the like area, &s;urrounded with buildings of magnificent ar|chitecture.
<PB N="221" REF="229">The comic &s;cene always con|&s;i&s;ted of a public place of dome&s;tic architec|ture; and was commonly divided into three parts, by two &s;treets opening up from it; &s;o that the actors came down the&s;e &s;treets to the audience: by this mean &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in an|cient dramas are accounted for, in which per|haps an actor expre&s;&s;es an ardent and repeated wi&s;h to &s;ee a per&s;on then on the &s;tage; that per&s;on is then in the other &s;treet, and cannot be &s;een by the actor, tho he is by the audience. The &s;cene of the <GAP DESC="foreign">, or farce, was always rural; as the &s;atyrs, its con&s;tant chorus, were the fancied inhabitants of the woods. The whole machinery of the ancient &s;cene con&s;i&s;ted in changing it, as either of the dramas were de&s;igned for repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>THE va&s;t &s;uperiority of the modern &s;cene for real repre&s;entation, the grand object of the drama, is &s;o evident, that, to in&s;i&s;t on it, were to affront your judgment.</P>
<P>NEXT to the &s;cene was the <GAP DESC="foreign">, the <HI>pro&s;cenium,</HI> or <HI>place before the &s;cene,</HI> as the name imports. In this the actors or mimics of the
<PB N="222" REF="230">play appeared. For you mu&s;t know, that with the ancients, the acting of a play was quite a di&s;tinct province from the &s;peaking or recita|tion. One &s;et of actors &s;poke, while another accompanied them with proper ge&s;tures. As the la&s;t was thought the mo&s;t important part of the drama, greater honour was paid to the mimics than to the reciters.</P>
<P>BELOW the <GAP DESC="foreign"> was the <GAP DESC="foreign">, where the reciters, above-mentioned, took their &s;ta|tion. In this <GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;tood fellows with mon|&s;trous ma&s;ks, contrived with &s;uch large gaping mouths, as if they meant to eat all the &s;pecta|tors, man, woman, and child, and leave none for to-morrow, as Lucian wittily tells us. The&s;e reciters, with the lungs of Ther&s;ites, rehear&s;ed the piece in mu&s;ical cadence; while the mu&s;ic of the orche&s;tra accompanied them, as it did the chorus when their turn came.</P>
<P>NEXT to this was the <GAP DESC="foreign">, or place of the chorus, who&s;e province you well know: and next the audience, as with us, the <GAP DESC="foreign">, where, with the Romans, the magi&s;trates and chief men of the city had a &s;uperb &s;eat ap|pointed
<PB N="223" REF="231">for them. The emperor's &s;eat was in the mid&s;t of the orche&s;tra, and called <HI>podium.</HI></P>
<P>THE theatre of the Romans differed from that of the Greeks in &s;ome re&s;pects. For ex|ample, the <HI>pulpitum</HI> of the former, and <GAP DESC="foreign"> of the latter, was &s;ometimes in the Latin theatre of the &s;ame elevation with the <HI>pro|&s;cenium:</HI> nay I que&s;tion if they were not &s;ome|times blended in one. The chorus was like|wi&s;e, now and then, placed in the orche&s;tra. The &s;cene of the Romans was &s;ometimes of amazing grandeur; that of the theatre of Ma|rius Scaurus being ornamented with 360 co|lumns, and 3000 &s;tatues.</P>
<P>BOTH in the Greek and Roman theatre the &s;pectators &s;at in uniform rows of &s;tone &s;eats, carried all round the &s;emicircle. The multi|tude of their <HI>vomitoria,</HI> or doors, is however much to be envied; as, in ca&s;e of accident from the number of candles, fireworks, &amp;c. employed in our theatres, the &s;mallne&s;s and fewne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;ages is &s;hockingly cruel and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="232">IN the ancient theatre plays were always repre&s;ented in broad day; and &s;ometimes four tragedies, one after another, all the work of one author when contending for the prize: while next day was &s;et apart for as many of an antagoni&s;t. The&s;e &s;trings of tragedies were called <GAP DESC="foreign">, and <GAP DESC="foreign">. Over the theatre, which was open above, in ca&s;e of rain, or inten&s;e heat of the &s;un, a va&s;t veil could be &s;pread by means of ea&s;y machin|ery: this veil was &s;ometimes of the fine&s;t &s;ilk.</P>
<P>SOME contend that the Romans were accu&s;|tomed to change their &s;cenes, during the repre|&s;entation of the &s;ame piece, from a mi&s;conception of this pa&s;&s;age of Servius, in his notes on the third Georgic: <HI>Scena quae fiebat aut ver&s;ilis erat, aut ductilis. Ver&s;ilis tunc erat, quum &s;ubito tota machinis quibu&s;dam convertebatur, et aliam picturae faciem o&s;tendebat. Ductilis tunc, quum tractis ta|bulariis hac atque illac &s;pecies picturae nudabatur interior.</HI> But this only applies to the change of &s;cene for each drama, as above expre&s;&s;ed; and as may be proved from this clear and po&s;itive pa&s;&s;age of Vitruvius, in the eighth chapter of his fifth book. <HI>Genera &s;unt &s;cenarum tria. Unum
<PB N="225" REF="233">quod dicitur tragicum, alterum comicum, tertium &s;atyricum. Horum autem ornatus &s;unt inter &s;e di&s;&s;imiles, di&s;parique ratione: quod tragicae defor|mantur</HI> (beware of tran&s;lating this <HI>deformed:</HI> it means in the cla&s;&s;ic Augu&s;tan Latin of Vitru|vius <HI>formed of, formantur de,</HI> as a monk would have phra&s;ed it) <HI>columnis, fa&s;tigiis, et &s;ignis, reli|qui&s;que regalibus rebus. Comicae autem aedificio|rum privatorum et menianorum habent &s;peciem, per&s;pectu&s;que fene&s;tris di&s;po&s;itos communium aedifi|ciorum rationibus. Satyricae vero ornantur arbori|bus, &s;peluncis, montibus, reliqui&s;que agre&s;tibus re|bus, in topiarii operis &s;peciem deformatis.</HI> From this you &s;ee that there were only three changes of &s;cene in every ancient theatre; and the&s;e adapted &s;olely to the different grand kinds of the drama.</P>
<P>NEED I de&s;cend to particulars, to evince the &s;uperiority of the modern &s;tage to the an|cient, after this genuine de&s;cription of the lat|ter, drawn from its cotemporaries? Mu&s;t not the whole repre&s;entation of the ancients have heaped ab&s;urdity upon ab&s;urdity? The mute action of the mimics; guided by the voice of the reciters, conveyed thro tubes of bra&s;s; and
<PB N="226" REF="234">&s;et off with a ma&s;que; the one &s;ide of which expre&s;&s;ed grief, and the other complacency; &s;o that the actor mu&s;t remember to turn his &s;ad &s;ide to the &s;pectators at the proper minute. The unnatural declamation accompanied with mu&s;ic. The chorus dancing and &s;inging at the intervals, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c. How &s;uperior is the natural neatne&s;s of our dramatic exhibitions, which repre&s;ent life it&s;elf, to the uncouth mag|nificence of the ancients! To dwell longer on this were needle&s;s, &s;o I &s;hall pa&s;s to the con&s;i|deration of the drama it&s;elf. To begin with tragedy.</P>
<P>THE fable of ancient tragedy is, in compa|ri&s;on with ours, amazingly barren and jejune. Milton's Samp&s;on is a true picture of mo&s;t ancient tragedies; and we all know what a yawning figure this would make on our &s;tage. In mo&s;t of their pieces there is but one inci|dent, and that contrived with little art; as in the Edipus Coloneus, where the per&s;onages exchange a number of &s;peeches, and then one of them dies. The only art of the author lies in &s;ummoning topics of verbal commi&s;eration. The Edipus Tyrannus is indeed an exception;
<PB N="227" REF="235">but the horror of the events is too &s;trong, and di&s;gu&s;ts the mind, in&s;tead of attracting its &s;ym|pathy. This remark affects not however the art of the author; which mu&s;t be allowed great, notwith&s;tanding that the tradition or narrative, upon which his piece &s;tands, mu&s;t have helped him in every particular. But, if art is the chief merit of tragedy, then is The Mourning Bride the fir&s;t of modern tragedies; as indeed it is pronounced by a Scoti&s;h critic, who in poetry knew not the be&s;t from the wor&s;t. Nothing &s;poils a tragedy more than an intricate plot; for no pa&s;&s;ion can be rai&s;ed where the judgment always intervenes.</P>
<P>IN contra&s;t, the modern tragedies &s;eldom have an implex fable; but abound with life, action, incident. They intere&s;t without per|plexing; and never pu&s;h the tragic pa&s;&s;ions to horror and di&s;gu&s;t. The chorus likewi&s;e de|&s;troyed the whole moral effect of tragedy, by thinking for the &s;pectators, who in that ca&s;e never think for them&s;elves. Modern tragedies are far better calculated to mend the heart and manners than the ancient: dome&s;tic tragedies, the mo&s;t moral and pathetic of all, bring ut|terly
<PB N="228" REF="236">unknown to the ancients; who thought that we could not cry, except when her ma|je&s;ty was a blubbering. The characters and language of our tragedies mu&s;t, of con&s;equence, be more various and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>IF in tragedy we excel the ancients, &s;till more in comedy and farce. Of the Greek comedy of Ari&s;tophanes let tho&s;e &s;peak who have di&s;covered that dung cea&s;es to &s;tink be|cau&s;e it is Athenian. Certainly a meaner or dirtier &s;cribbler never di&s;graced any country than that ancient buffoon: he is &s;o totally without merit, that to take the trouble of ex|pre&s;&s;ing &s;upreme contempt for him, is paying him too great honour. What has pre&s;erved his pitiful works? Style almighty &s;tyle! Of the comedies of Philemon and Menander, we have many fragments which &s;hew the in&s;ipid mora|lity with which they were fraught. Our &s;en|timental comedy is a mere joke to them for &s;oporification. The comedies of Terence are tran&s;lations from theirs; and we &s;ee how totally de&s;titute they are of the <HI>vis comica;</HI> &s;o much &s;o as even to di&s;gu&s;t the ancients them&s;elves; wit|ne&s;s the&s;e ver&s;es of the great Cae&s;ar, pre&s;erved by Suetonius:
<PB N="229" REF="237">
<Q><L>Tu quoque, tu in &s;ummis, O dimidiate Menander,</L>
<L>Poneris; et merito, puri &s;ermonis amator;</L>
<L>Lenibus atque utinam &s;criptis adjuncta foret vis</L>
<L>Comica, ut aequato virtus polleret honore:</L>
<L>Cum Graecis neque in hac de&s;pectus parte jaceres:</L>
<L>Unum hoc maceror et doleo tibi dee&s;&s;e, Terenti.</L></Q>
Intricate plot, and artificial ligature of &s;cenes, we find in Terence: but every thing el&s;e is wanting: character, &s;ituation, incident, wit, humour, laughter, gaiety: indeed, the whole of that by which comedy is comedy. His dramas, in &s;hort, are dramas for mathematicians.</P>
<P>THE &s;uperiority of our farce to the ancient need not be remarked, after the account I lately &s;ent you of the latter. The chorus; its con&s;i&s;t|ing always of &s;atyrs, &amp;c. are manife&s;t &s;hackles which bound down the ancient farce in the dungeon of dulne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE duration of the ancient tragic drama I have already pointed out, as &s;horter, and pre|ferable to ours: perhaps you will &s;ay, that the want of incident authori&s;ed the brevity of the Greek tragedy. But you will remember that I took my in&s;tance from the Edipus Tyrannus, a play that hath &s;ufficient incident for a modern
<PB N="230" REF="238">drama. Since I wrote to you on the duration of the drama, I have found the following pa&s;&s;age in Cicero, which leads me to think that the ancients con&s;idered the drama as re&s;tricted to three acts. It is in the fir&s;t book of his Letters <HI>Ad Quintium Fratrem,</HI> and runs thus: <HI>Illud te ad entremum oro et bortor ut, tanquam poetae boni, et actores indu&s;trii &s;olent, &s;ic tu</HI> in extrema parte et conclu&s;ione <HI>muneris, ac negotii tui, diligenti&s;&s;i|mus &s;is: ut hic tertius annus, tanquam</HI> tertius ac|tus, <HI>perfecti&s;&s;imus atque ornati&s;&s;imus fui&s;&s;e videatur.</HI> I think this proof po&s;itive, and &s;incerely believe that little Horace, like a Sabine puppy, was impudent enough to pre&s;cribe an ab&s;olute rule of poetry from his own &s;kull; and that we poor moderns are &s;o weak as to reverence his <HI>ip&s;e dixit</HI> as an oracle, which for foundation hath not the &s;hadow of a dream.</P>
<P>GRAVINA, in his book <HI>Della Tragedia,</HI> to which I am much obliged, hath well &s;hewn that Ari&s;totle's work on poetry is a crude and indige&s;ted performance, written by the author in his &s;illy vanity of dictating in every &s;cience then known to man. Indeed, both Victorius and Ca&s;telvetro agree with him, that this trea|ti&s;e
<PB N="231" REF="239">of Ari&s;totle is full of gro&s;s improprieties and ab&s;urdities, that could only proceed from an author's writing on a &s;ubject he knew no|thing of. The book of Longinus on the Sub|lime is the &s;econd ancient work of critici&s;m that hath reached us; and in it the Sublime is confounded with the Beautiful and the Tender, qualities of writing directly oppo&s;ite. So that little can be &s;aid of the perfection of ancient critici&s;m.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee I u&s;e the privilege of epi&s;tolary writing; and give you my thoughts as they ri&s;e, without &s;tudying arrangement. I hope, however, I do not go to play till after I have done my bu&s;ine&s;s; and you know that of this Letter was to &s;hew the &s;uperiority of the modern drama to the ancient: a point which I hope I have proved to a demon&s;tration almo&s;t mathematical.</P>

As France at that period led the fa&s;hions of England, both men|tal and corporeal, it is no wonder that Addi&s;on, one of the be&s;t writers and wor&s;t critics in the world, &s;hut his eyes, and followed the French <HI>petit-maitre en critique.</HI></P>
<P>ADDISON, I am convinced, never read Ta&s;&s;o's Gieru&s;alemme; as I think it hath lately been pretty well proved, that he never read the Aminta. Had he peru&s;ed the works of that wonderful writer, he would have blu&s;hed to
<PB N="233" REF="241">challenge him for a fault which be never once is blameable of: Ta&s;&s;o hath in&s;tances of &s;peech too figurative, but as little tin&s;el as Homer. He might, with equal propriety, have &s;aid that Milton's works teem with athei&s;m.</P>
<P>IN Ta&s;&s;o I remember &s;carce one fal&s;e orna|ment. The palace of Armida, tho the &s;cene of enchantment, is not adorned with decorations of gla&s;s, but of diamond; as &s;trong as it is bril|liant. The bird which &s;ings an amatory ditty, that image of the Gieru&s;alemme which ap|proaches nighe&s;t to the bounds of fal&s;e orna|ment, hath in this view nothing unnatural: it is enchantment; it is beyond nature; and of con|&s;equence vindicable, nay mode&s;t, when con&s;i|dered in its proper point of light. Virgil's trees that groan and drop blood, without &s;uch an excu&s;e, I allow tin&s;ical and futile to the la&s;t degree. As to the language of Ta&s;&s;o, tho he wrote in a &s;tanza which mu&s;t have compelled him to redundance, yet I pronounce it as grave and proper, with all its riches, as that of almo&s;t any Greek cla&s;&s;ic whatever, tho the Greeks laboured under no &s;uch inconvenience. It is the Latins, tho&s;e apes clad in Grecian
<PB N="234" REF="242">cloaths, whom we may &s;afely accu&s;e of tin&s;el or fal&s;e ornament, both of images and language. Let us con&s;ider a few pa&s;&s;ages of Virgil, al|lowed their mo&s;t judicious writer, in this view. I have never read his Eneid with this intent, as would be nece&s;&s;ary to give a detail of all the tin&s;el of it, &s;o can only give &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as at pre&s;ent occur to my memory. Indeed I never look into Virgil but with utter di&s;gu&s;t, while Homer always gives me fre&s;h rapture.</P>
<P>I MUST premi&s;e, that we are not to wonder at Virgil's tin&s;el, for we know that Mecenas, whom we look upon as a model of ta&s;te, and who was Virgil's patron, was fond of tin&s;el to exce&s;s. Augu&s;tus u&s;ed to rally him always on it, as we learn from Suetonius: and Macrobius hath pre&s;erved a part of a Letter from Augu&s;|tus to Mecenas, running thus: <HI>Vale mel gem|meum Medulliae, ebur ex Etruria, la&s;er Aretinum, adamas &s;upernas, Tiberinum margaritum, Cilnio|rum &s;maragdae, ja&s;pi figulorum, berylle Por&s;ennae, carbunculum Italiae, <GAP DESC="foreign"> moecharum.</HI> Ah, Mecenas, what a poor <HI>Mecenas</HI> thou mu&s;t have been!</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="243">IN the Eneid, Book II. The expre&s;&s;ion <HI>ferit aurea &s;idera clamor</HI> may ju&s;tly be arraigned as tin&s;ical, and of fal&s;e brilliance. A <HI>cry &s;triking the golden &s;tars</HI> approaches much to glorious non&s;en&s;e. A cry, a &s;ound, cannot &s;trike &s;ave organs of hearing, or of reverberation: &s;triking the &s;tars is a puerile hyperbole: the <HI>golden</HI> &s;tars, a yet more puerile epithet, on an occa&s;ion in which their boundle&s;s altitude &s;hould have been the idea, if an epithet was nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>THE &s;tory of Polydorus, in the Third Book, is perhaps the mo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary piece of empty decoration to be found in the works of any writer ancient or modern.</P>

<Q><L>Tres imbris torti radios, tres nubis aquo&s;ae;</L>
<L>Addiderant rutili tres ignis, et alitis au&s;tri,</L>

<P>HAD this &s;tood in any writer on whom our timid critics dared to exert their judgment, what laughter, what deri&s;ion, of that tin&s;ical author who could affront the judgment of his readers with &s;uch a <HI>caput mortuum</HI> of empty non&s;en&s;e!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>ANY ob&s;ervation or di&s;covery, which tends to the improvement of our lan|guage, gives me particular plea&s;ure: I there|fore agree with you in your applau&s;e of Mr. Sheridan's remark, that the S, which abounds &s;o much in the Engli&s;h orthography, hath very often the power of Z. Why &s;hould it not be written accordingly? Why not &s;pell <HI>hiz, uz, her'z; enclozez, arizez,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.? I long to &s;ee that hi&s;&s;ing letter as &s;carce in the language as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h tongue is &s;ufficiently &s;trong, rich, and univer&s;al; mu&s;icalne&s;s and &s;oftne&s;s are the only qualities it wants. The greate&s;t prai&s;e is therefore due to any writer who at|tempts to improve its melody. Upon many years accurate attention be&s;towed on our lan|guage, it appears to me, that it is to the con|&s;onant terminations that the har&s;hne&s;s of our &s;peech may be imputed. Some words of frequent
<PB N="238" REF="246">occurrence are al&s;o very rude; and twenty words of very common u&s;e will, if har&s;h, de|&s;troy the tone of a language; and, if uncouthly &s;pelt, will, to the eye, which ought to be con|&s;ulted in orthography full as much as the ear, injure the <HI>form</HI> of a whole language. Such foreigners find our <HI>though, through, enough, rough, tough,</HI> and all other words in <HI>ugh, ughly-headed mon&s;ters,</HI> to u&s;e Milton's ortho|graphy, which of them&s;elves are &s;ufficient to make our tongue pa&s;s for a dialect of the High Dutch. How are they &s;urprized to find us pronounce <HI>tho, thro, enuf, ruf, tuf!</HI> and be at the expence of horrible gutturals, to make our language have a hottentot air, which gutturals we cannot pronounce! In poetry for many a century we have written <HI>tho; thro;</HI> and &s;o they ought always to be &s;pelt in pro&s;e by every per|&s;on who hath any reverence for the eyes of his readers, the <HI>o</HI> in <HI>thro</HI> having the &s;ame &s;ound as in <HI>to, do:</HI> but if any one chu&s;es to &s;pell <HI>throu,</HI> I have no objection. We &s;hould certainly write <HI>ruf, enuf, tuf: br&ocirc;te, th&ocirc;te, n&icirc;te,</HI> &amp;c. Why write &s;o many towns With <HI>burgh?</HI> do not we pro|nounce <HI>bura?</HI> A little ridicule of &s;cioli&s;ts al|ways attends the fir&s;t introduction of a novelty
<PB N="239" REF="247">into language, tho it &s;hould be infinitely for the better; but this one mu&s;t put up with, in &s;ure expectation of the prai&s;e of po&s;terity, and that of enlightened judges of one's own time.</P>
<P>THE chief fault of our language is, that almo&s;t all its words end in con&s;onants. The great point is to throw out every final con&s;o|nant which we can. <HI>Alway,</HI> for in&s;tance, is the old &s;pelling of <HI>always,</HI> and is better: <HI>al&s;o</HI> is, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, &s;uperior to <HI>likewi&s;e,</HI> which hath the &s;ound of a con&s;onant in its termination. I could al&s;o wi&s;h to &s;ee the old <HI>fro</HI> &s;ub&s;tituted in lieu of <HI>from;</HI> the old <HI>ne</HI> for <HI>nor</HI> is better than its &s;ub&s;titute. If the con&s;onant cannot be re|jected, we &s;hould at lea&s;t &s;often it, if po&s;&s;ible; and never, for example, write <HI>has, does;</HI> but <HI>hath, doth:</HI> the <HI>th</HI> is frequent in the Greek, and is quite melodious. In&s;tead of <HI>draws, views, plays, throws,</HI> or even <HI>draweth,</HI> &amp;c. I believe a wellwi&s;her to the <HI>tune</HI> of our tongue will write <HI>doth draw, doth play,</HI> &amp;c. to pre&s;erve &s;uch very few words as we have ending in vowel-&s;ounds. The Greek and Latin, and the modern Italian and French, have not &s;o many words ending in con&s;onants as we by a great deal. A
<PB N="240" REF="248">matter of regret to every admirer of the Eng|li&s;h language: and indeed had not fortunately our adverbs, for the mo&s;t part, been taken from the French, with the fine vowel termination of <HI>y,</HI> but far better in the old &s;pelling <HI>ie;</HI> as <HI>namely, boldly,</HI> &amp;c. our tongue mu&s;t have been &s;till more &s;adly hurt by con&s;onant-terminations. The great &s;ecret of writing melodious Engli&s;h is &s;urely to draw into view every po&s;&s;ible word which may terminate with a vowel.</P>
<P>COMMON phra&s;es which are ungrammatical a good writer &s;hould ever avoid, tho they have high authority to &s;upport them. Such are <HI>methinks, to-day,</HI> and the like. Dr. Arm|&s;trong in his <HI>Sketches by Launcelot Temple,</HI><ABBR><HI>E&s;q</HI></ABBR> hath given us &s;ome ju&s;t ob&s;ervations on our language. How the non&s;en&s;ical phra&s;e <HI>&s;ubject-matter</HI> &s;hould be &s;till u&s;ed, in &s;pite of the ridi|cule he hath entailed on it, I cannot conceive. He ob&s;erves that <HI>betwixt</HI> &s;hould never be u&s;ed for <HI>between.</HI> To which let me add, that it is quite amazing to &s;ee an author, who hath ears and eyes, write <HI>among&s;t.</HI> Gray, tho he writes with melody, hath <HI>amid&s;t!</HI> Are not <HI>among</HI> and <HI>amid</HI> Engli&s;h words? <HI>Be&s;ides</HI> for <HI>be&s;ide</HI> is liable
<PB N="241" REF="249">to the &s;ame objection. The diphthongs <HI>ae</HI> and <HI>oe</HI> are now unknown to our tongue, being trans|formed into <HI>e,</HI> and with great propriety. To words &s;poilt in our &s;pelling may be added the preterite, &amp;c. of &s;ome verbs. <HI>I read, I have read your book:</HI> do not we pronounce <HI>redd?</HI> and an eminent writer in his familiar letters &s;pells it <HI>redde.</HI> The preterite of no verb &s;hould be the &s;ame with the pre&s;ent, el&s;e inexplicable confu|&s;ion will ari&s;e: but barbarians have formed our tongue, and men of &s;cience are afraid to meddle with it; el&s;e why not write <HI>hurted</HI> as well as <HI>parted,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. However, a writer of any preci&s;ion or elegance, will ever write <HI>did hurt,</HI> &amp;c. at lea&s;t. Why &s;hould we &s;pell <HI>vanities,</HI> &amp;c. when the &s;ingular is <HI>vanity?</HI> The plural &s;tood &s;o when the word was &s;pelt <HI>vanitie,</HI> and we retain it; tho the lazine&s;s merely of &s;ub&s;titut|ing one letter for two made &s;ome blockhead very improperly write <HI>vanity.</HI> Such is the pro|gre&s;s of our language!</P>
<P>DR. LOWTH, in his Grammar, &s;eems not to know what to make of <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> If we &s;ay <HI>he came him&s;elf,</HI> it is non&s;en&s;e: if <HI>he came his &s;elf;</HI> it is not &s;en&s;e. I wi&s;h each of our Gothic
<PB N="242" REF="250">ance&s;tors <HI>them&s;elves</HI> had a drubbing to <HI>him&s;elf</HI> for inventing &s;uch words. We u&s;e <HI>your&s;elf</HI> in every <HI>ca&s;e;</HI> it would &s;eem we &s;hould al&s;o &s;ay <HI>their &s;elves, his &s;elf,</HI> in all ca&s;es: if we &s;ay <HI>you your&s;elf, of your&s;elf, to your&s;elf, your&s;elf, O you your&s;elf, by or with your&s;elf;</HI> we mu&s;t of cour&s;e &s;ay <HI>they their&s;elves, of their&s;elves, to their&s;elves, their&s;elves, O they their&s;elves, by or with their|&s;elves:</HI> and <HI>he his &s;elf of his &s;elf, to his &s;elf, his &s;elf; O he his &s;elf, by or with his &s;elf. Self</HI> in old Engli&s;h is &s;ynonymous with <HI>&s;ame,</HI> as <HI>&s;elve day, &s;elve colour.</HI></P>
<P>IT is mortifying to every judge of language, who mu&s;t know that the melody and elegance of a tongue depend altogether upon its vowel terminations, to reflect that in Engli&s;h not above a dozen common words end in <HI>a;</HI> as <HI>villa, idea, piazza, aera, quota, &s;tanza,</HI> and one or two more: <HI>lea, plea, &s;ea,</HI> &amp;c. do not &s;ound as if they ended in <HI>a.</HI> In <HI>&eacute;</HI> not one word ends: nor in <HI>i!</HI> In <HI>o</HI> about two dozen; as <HI>go, to, &s;o, wo, lo, &s;tucco, tobacco, calico, portico, do, cargo, echo, tho, who, intaglio, ratio, &s;olo,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Who&s;o</HI> I would recommend to &s;ucceed <HI>who&s;oever,</HI> as it preceded in antiquity; <HI>whereto, hitherto,</HI> are bet|ter
<PB N="243" REF="251">than any &s;ub&s;titutes. In <HI>u</HI> we have no word whatever, and the Romans had very few: in <HI>ou</HI> we have only two, <HI>thou, you.</HI> In <HI>y</HI> we have no le&s;s than 4900 words, about an eighth of our lan|guage; our words amounting to about 35,000. Of this number I would propo&s;e that the <HI>&eacute;</HI> be re&s;tored to all the &s;ub&s;tantives: for in&s;tance, we &s;hould write <HI>beaut&eacute;, treat&eacute;, ivor&eacute;,</HI> &amp;c. as from the French. In <HI>w,</HI> as a vowel, we have a few of the mo&s;t &s;onorous words in our language, as <HI>flow, blow, new, &s;aw, law,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>IT is &s;hocking to remark that we have 1683 words ending in <HI>e&s;s,</HI> the mo&s;t horrid of all ter|minations. This is owing to the qualified &s;ub|&s;tantives in <HI>ne&s;s,</HI> as <HI>holine&s;&s;, happine&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. mo&s;t of which may be regarded as ob&s;olete with all my heart, for we have <HI>&s;anctitude, felicity,</HI> &amp;c. &s;o that almo&s;t every one may be avoided, as they always are by good writers. But the ne|gative <HI>le&s;s,</HI> the great cau&s;e of our other termi|nations in <HI>e&s;s,</HI> cannot be &s;o ea&s;ily thrown out: yea a double <HI>&s;s</HI> is now nece&s;&s;ary, for we can never write <HI>endles, needles,</HI> without confu&s;ion. What &s;hall we &s;ay to <HI>hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s, fearle&s;&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and other delicious words? They may be in
<PB N="244" REF="252">the language, but will never be in that of a ma&s;ter of it. By the way, if we wrote <HI>z</HI> in &s;tead of <HI>s,</HI> in many in&s;tances, we might even &s;pell <HI>needlez</HI> without confu&s;ion ari&s;ing from the plural of <HI>needle.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY country &s;choolma&s;ter, and compiler of grammars or dictionaries, will tell us that our language is cla&s;&s;ic and perfect. For lo! grammars have been written of it within the&s;e <HI>twenty</HI> years, &s;o that it is &s;tationary and <HI>quite the thing,</HI> and a very pretty thing it is. My dear friend, you know that our language is not yet one century old, as to orthography, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential point of any &s;peech. Look into Milton's MSS. or his own editions, and you will &s;ee this at once. Now I will hazard a bold opinion, namely, that our language is now infinitely more barbarous, in all re&s;pects, than it was in the days of Chaucer. For me|lody there is no compari&s;on; the <HI>&eacute;</HI> always pronounced, as in <HI>&s;pok&eacute;, &s;hak&eacute;,</HI> &amp;c. was alone &s;ufficient to render it much more melodious. It is truly ri&s;ible to hear how we talk of our language. Did you never read of that village of Spani&s;h <HI>aborigines,</HI> di&s;covered by the duke of
<PB N="245" REF="253">Alva's hawk, who, being quite inclo&s;ed with rocky mountains, thought there was no world beyond their barriers? This is a lively type of our predilection for our native tongue; while, compared with the Italian or Spani&s;h, it is har&s;h to exce&s;s. The emperor Charles V. we are told, &s;aid he would talk French to his friend, Italian to his mi&s;tre&s;s, and Engli&s;h to his hor&s;e. I &s;uppo&s;e, by the bye, that, in ob&s;ervance of this apophthegm, our &s;enators &s;o much frequent the academy of Newmarket, in order that, by much conver&s;ation with their hor&s;es, they may be qualified to &s;peak good Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, it mu&s;t be allowed, that if the Engli&s;h is too har&s;h, the Italian is too &s;oft; and it will be ea&s;ier to &s;often the Engli&s;h than to harden the Italian. The Spani&s;h is not &s;o rich as the Engli&s;h, and therefore is inferior. For the French, I know not what to call it. If we call it a language, it is as we call the droning of a bagpipe mu&s;ic. In pronounciation it is a na&s;al redundancy of gibberi&s;h: in writ|ing &mdash; it mu&s;t not be pronounced! Silent con&s;onants, a phenomenon of non&s;en&s;e un|known
<PB N="246" REF="254">to any other tongue under heaven, either ancient or modern, have &s;uch an effect on it that not above twenty words in the whole language are pronounced as they are written. In &s;hort, it is a language which &s;hocks the eye and the ear, is incapable of poetry, and di&s;agreeable in pro&s;e; and yet the French have their <HI>cla&s;&s;ies!</HI> How this pitiful tongue hath become &s;o prevalent, I cannot ac|count; unle&s;s it be in accompli&s;hment of the Scripture, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in &s;pirit, for they &s;hall be exalted.</HI> The conte&s;t for &s;uperiority among the modern tongues (I &s;peak without any &s;hadow of prejudice) lies between the Engli&s;h and Italian.</P>
<P>OF the&s;e the Engli&s;h e&s;pecially hath va&s;t defects; and is capable of great improvements. But how &s;hall the&s;e defects be removed, and how &s;hall the&s;e improvements be given? Very ea&s;ily. We know, from the pillar of Duillius, that the Latin was, in the time of the &s;econd Punic war, as barbarous as the Engli&s;h is now; yet, in little more than a century afterward, the language of Cicero appeared. Here is the point: in Greece and Rome, men of &s;cience
<PB N="247" REF="255">refined and fixed the tongues: in England the barbarous blockheads of the lowe&s;t mob have corrupted and degraded the language, and it is ridicule for a man qualified to judge of it, even to give a new &s;pelling! In France, the &s;peech which was thought fixed, hath gone thro in|numerable changes even in the ten&s;es of verbs, &s;uch as <HI>etait, avait,</HI> &amp;c. u&s;ed within the&s;e twenty years for the old <HI>etoit, avoit,</HI> &amp;c. Milton, in mo&s;t of his works, adopted the old orthography of Engli&s;h, in contempt of the mob of &s;cioli&s;ts, as he calls them; men who know nothing, yet judge of every thing, without being capable of examining, or going further than they did at &s;chool. But &s;ince his time no writer hath had courage to bear up again&s;t the vulgar; and the con&s;equence is that the head follows the tail.</P>
<P>THE plan would be, my friend, that the king &s;hould incorporate one hundred, or indeed all, of the mo&s;t learned men in the kingdom: or they &s;hould a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves, under the name of <HI>The Academy for Improving the Language.</HI> The great intent &s;hould be to &s;often and tune the Engli&s;h &s;peech as much as po&s;&s;ible: new
<PB N="248" REF="256">modes of &s;pelling, and new u&s;es of vowels ought to be adopted. The Academy &s;hould publi&s;h a grammar and dictionary, in which the new orthography &s;hould be u&s;ed: and all the members, and indeed all the <HI>literati</HI> in the kingdom, &s;hould unite to a&s;&s;ert their proper power over the mob. I am convinced, that in Rome the written language of the vulgar was quite different from that of the learned, till a century after Cicero. In ancient Greece, and in modern Italy, the colloquial dialects varied in journeying over every ten miles: in both countries the written language of the literati con&s;i&s;ts of flowers taken from all the&s;e dialects. Had we a &s;cientific language al&s;o, it were an admirable in&s;titution. And perhaps a thou&s;and years hence, when the Briti&s;h power may be no more, the language would &s;urvive: an event which, it may be feared, cannot be effected even by Milton and Shak&s;pere, if the &s;peech remains in its pre&s;ent rude &s;tate. I do not mean that our &s;cientific language &s;hould be indebted to our different dialects, as the Greek and Italian; for I know not of one Scotici&s;m, Irici&s;m, or provinciali&s;m, which would contri|bute in the lea&s;t to the elegance of our tongue.
<PB N="249" REF="257">The &s;ole intention &s;hould be to improve our orthography, and give us a number of vowel-terminations. The <HI>&eacute;</HI> &s;hould, in particular, be always pronounced as in <HI>the:</HI> the Germans pronounce it; and, were not their &s;peech full of gutturals, the con&s;equence would be that it would, from this very circum&s;tance, prove more melodious than the Engli&s;h. I look upon the Greek as the mo&s;t perfect language, both for &s;trength and melody, that ever was known: now in Greek I have found that the vowel terminations of words taken as they run in any book, are equal to one third of the lan|guage. In Engli&s;h the vowel terminations amount but to one fourth of the language; it follows that we want vowel terminations for about 8000 words. How are they to be &s;up|plied? &s;uppo&s;e</P>

Ridicule is indeed &s;o far from being the te&s;t of truth, that no per&s;on or object in nature is not capable of being viewed in a ridiculous light. Monte&s;quieu ob&s;erves, that women, who&s;e under&s;tandings are generally weak, are the &s;upreme and im|mediate judges of ridicule.

The <HI>r</HI> is very har&s;h; and wherever any of them can be turned out, the better, tho the <HI>t</HI> be a very &s;oft vowel, and the <HI>n</HI> hath a fine &s;ilver &s;ound.</P>
<P>IT may &s;trike you that the plural in <HI>a</HI> might have an effect like the &s;upernumerary <HI>a</HI> in bur|le&s;que &s;ongs; as, <HI>He was a gallant knight-a,</HI> &amp;c. But this very &s;ingularity of a &s;uperfluous vowel, unknown to other languages, proves that we want terminating vowels to the melody of our tongue; and that <HI>a</HI> is chiefly wanted.</P>
<P>LASTLY, mo&s;t of the alterations in the &s;pe|cimen are not <HI>innovations,</HI> but <HI>re&s;torations of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ancient language.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="275">SINCE I am treating the improvement of language, give me leave to add a very few re|marks on the pre&s;ent Greek characters u&s;ed in printing, which are in a &s;hocking &s;tate indeed.</P>
<P>ALDUS, and the other printers who fir&s;t printed Greek, adopted at once the mo&s;t bar|barous characters then u&s;ed by the Greek ama|nuen&s;es. Hence the fir&s;t Greek characters are wor&s;e than the Roman, tho the later are very un&s;hapely. By a &s;ingular fatality the Roman character hath been improved, and brought to &s;upreme elegance; while the Greek hath got wor&s;e and wor&s;e. The abominable contrac|tions, which appear in almo&s;t every word of the fir&s;t editions of Latin books, are now no where to be found. The more abominable contractions, and di&s;torted letters, of the early Greek editions, &s;till exi&s;t in all their glory!</P>
<P>COMMON &s;en&s;e! Common &s;en&s;e! what an uncommon thing art thou!</P>
<P>THE &s;trange letters and contractions now u&s;ed in the Greek, are no older than the tenth, century, as may be &s;een in Montfaucon's
<PB N="268" REF="276"><HI>Palaeographia Graeca.</HI> They were introduced by mo&s;t barbarous monks, in the mo&s;t barba|rous age; and we, more barbarous than the mo&s;t barbarous, retain them! Before that period of deep ignorance, the Greek was all written in elegant and formal CAPITALS; of which fine &s;pecimens exi&s;t, &s;uch as the Alexandrian Old and New Te&s;tament in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;e|um, and others. After that, the Greek ama|nuen&s;es, <GAP DESC="foreign">, as they called them&s;elves, began to u&s;e &s;mall characters, in imitation of the copiers of Latin as would &s;eem, and to &s;tudy to unite them. They were ignorant that the genius of the Greek and Roman written character is quite di&s;tinct, and that he who attempts to bind the Greek letters to one ano|ther, will totally de&s;troy any &s;hadow of their form. This they might have learned from the very fir&s;t attempts, as we ob&s;erve in the epi&s;tle of a Byzantine emperor to a king of France, given in <HI>fac &s;imile</HI> by Montfaucon, which re|&s;embles the Arabic much more than the Greek. Modern Greeks find it impo&s;&s;ible to give a ligature to more than two letters in writing, and even then the form is injured: to write three without quite annihilating the character,
<PB N="269" REF="277">I will venture to pronounce an impo&s;&s;ibility. Some of the&s;e contractions and ligatures have been of &s;hocking con&s;equence to the &s;en&s;e of authors, as Montfaucon &s;hews; and even now it takes a keen eye to di&s;cern between &sfgr;, <HI>s,</HI> and &sfgr;, <HI>&s;t.</HI> This &s;trange jumbling of characters to|gether, hath been one grand cau&s;e of the total barbari&s;m in which we now &s;ee the Greek. Another grand cau&s;e ari&s;es from the horrible contractions. Now the joke is, that all the&s;e contractions are elongations! It will take a man far longer to write them than the letters they repre&s;ent. They put me in mind of &amp; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and of a contraction I have &s;een on a &s;ign|po&s;t in a village: ALEXANDERE BROWN. Yet to the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed contractions and ligatures is it owing that the pre&s;ent Greek character is more ugly than that of any language whatever; tho at fir&s;t it was as di&s;tinct and elegant as the Roman.</P>
<P>THE re&s;toration of the Greek characters were very ea&s;y; and yet a printer would gain immortality by it. Let us &s;ee.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="278">THE pre&s;ent Greek capitals are <GAP DESC="foreign"> Of the&s;e I only object to two, the &THgr; and &Xgr;; both of Which hurt the eye very much, becau&s;e the parts of them are detached and broken a&s;under. They occur of &s;everal forms in old Greek in|&s;criptions and manu&s;cripts; but I prefer tho&s;e marked 1 &amp; 2, in the little &s;ketch annexed, which are much more plea&s;ing to the eye: the &OHgr; is far better in the form of fig. 3. as mark|ing <HI>o long.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it is in the &s;mall Greek alphabet that &s;upreme improvements may be made; and I &s;ubjoin &s;uch a one as I think the be&s;t, after con&s;ulting many MSS. &amp;c. on the occa&s;ion. The pre&s;ent &zgr; and &xgr;, in particular, are horrible apothecaries marks. For both I give their capitals with a &s;light variation in the former. It mu&s;t be remarked, that the &s;mall Greek let|ter never admits of what letter-founders call a <HI>ceriph,</HI> or line acro&s;s the terminations, as the Roman.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome books printed at Ba&s;il by <HI>Curio</HI> and others about 1540, an Italic Greek characte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="271" REF="279">appears with much elegance, allowing for con|tractions and ligatures. This, if the printers plea&s;e, may be called <HI>Ba&s;il Greek.</HI> As I think this variety would be as elegant and u&s;eful in the Greek as in the Latin and modern tongues, I have likewi&s;e given an alphabet of it. The twenty-four &s;mall Greek characters which I have given, I need hardly add will an&s;wer every po&s;&s;ible u&s;e fully as well as the twenty-four common large Greek characters; or as all the contractions and ligatures in the world, tho as an eminent letter-founder informs me, they amount to about <HI>three hundred even now in daily u&s;e!</HI></P>
<P>As to the Greek accents, every one knows that they are more u&s;ele&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible, than the ligatures and contractions. The mark of a&s;pi|ration ought alone to be retained and made of &s;ome <HI>body,</HI> and apart, as what is called a <HI>&s;uperior</HI> letter, in whatever form is mo&s;t agreeable, for MSS. and printed books differ; but the be&s;t &s;eems to be a &s;mall Roman [h] turned back|ward, as that marked 4. In the Alexandrian Bible, thought to be of the 4th or 5th century, the only note like an accent is a dot over the <HI>&ggr;.</HI>
<PB N="272" REF="280">Nor can accents be traced higher than the 10th or 11th century, when they appeared along with contractions and ligatures. True it is that a Greek manu&s;cript was lately found at Herculaneum with <HI>accents;</HI> that is, the acute accent was put <HI>upon every vowel.</HI> A practice ju&s;t as rational as any other in this way. The Germans alone of all modern European na|tions, read the Greek by the accents; and &s;ay <GAP DESC="foreign">for in&s;tance, not <GAP DESC="foreign">; &s;o that the power of the <HI>omega</HI> is lo&s;t, and it is confounded with <HI>omicron.</HI> Nay the modern Greeks all read by the accents, in which they &s;hew total igno|rance of the Greek. Nor let this be wondered at, for who of us knows how Chaucer pro|nounced Engli&s;h? The &s;lender <HI>a,</HI> &s;o common in our language, is not fo old as Elizabeth's time. Le Maurier, in his <HI>Memoires de la Hollande,</HI> tells us, that Elizabeth pronounced French ill; &s;aying, <HI>maa foi,</HI> and <HI>paar Dieu.</HI> A &s;en&s;ible antiquary ob&s;erves, that now &s;he would have &s;aid <HI>mai foi,</HI> and <HI>per Dieu. Dance, France,</HI> with a thou&s;and more words, in which the <HI>a</HI> &s;lender now appears, were formerly written as pronounced, <HI>Daunce, Fraunce,</HI> &amp;c. Nothing fluctuates &s;o much as language; and
<PB N="273" REF="281">he that looks for ancient Greek among the modern Greeks will find him&s;elf mi&s;taken. They have altered the &s;ound of almo&s;t every vowel; nay have gone &s;o far as to give the <HI>eta</HI> the &s;ound of <HI>ep&s;ilon,</HI> and the rever&s;e. They &s;ay <GAP DESC="foreign"> for <GAP DESC="foreign">, and <GAP DESC="foreign"> for <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c.</P>
<P>BY the bye, it is &s;urprizing that not one Engli&s;hman, &s;ave Milton, &s;eems to have di&s;co|vered that the Engli&s;h pronounciation of the Latin is improper. The <HI>a</HI> in Latin is always broad; as is the <HI>e.</HI> The <HI>i</HI> has the power of our <HI>e</HI> &s;lender. The Romans did not pronounce <HI>&s;atyetas,</HI> but <HI>&s;achietas,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Milton ordered his daughters to read to him accord|ingly, as we find in his Life by Birch. Indeed, it is as ab&s;urd to read Latin in Engli&s;h as to read French &s;o.</P>
<P>BEFORE I give you my Greek alphabet, which is not new, I a&s;&s;ure you, but very an|cient, I &s;hall ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that one or two of the Latin characters might be improved, or rather re&s;tored. Such is the a, which would be far more elegant if given in the form u&s;ed in writing. (See that marked *.) The &s;mall
<PB N="274" REF="282">belly is very di&s;agreeable to the eye; and the other would be far more round and beautiful. The g is &s;till wor&s;e, and hurts the eye very much. It &s;hould be given as that marked &dagger;, or that with &sect;. The other characters are very neat and plea&s;ing. The dot over the i might however be &s;pared, as quite unnece&s;&s;ary, and only &s;erving to injure the beauty and regularity of the line. Printers &s;eem at a lo&s;s for marks of annotation, and even tho&s;e they u&s;e are get|ting more and more ugly; particularly the cro&s;s &dagger;, and double cro&s;s &Dagger;, which have unfor|tunately been called <HI>dagger,</HI> and double-dagger; and &s;ome <HI>learned</HI> letter-founders have now be|gun to form them accordingly. The &sect; is not a proper notation-mark, as it implies <HI>&s;ection,</HI> and is daily u&s;ed in the true &s;en&s;e. The * is the only decent mark left; and this, like all the others, is made four times the &s;ize it &s;hould be. It is impo&s;&s;ible to make tho&s;e marks too &s;mall; for it is only nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ee them, and every eye can &s;ee even a <HI>point.</HI> They ought always to be very minute, and <HI>&s;uperior.</HI> As I look upon the &s;malle&s;t parts of this &s;uperlative art as important, I annex &s;ome new marks of annotation, and the proper form of the cro&s;s and double cro&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="283">THO I wi&s;h to &s;ee variations for the better in the Engli&s;h language, yet, be a&s;&s;ured, that there cannot be a variation, even for the better, in the &s;incere &s;peech of friend&s;hip, with which I am, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR ob&s;ervations on the various kinds of literary fame are curious. But there is one &s;pecies which hath e&s;caped you; and that is where an author writes in a &s;tyle that might well give delight to the learned, and yet, by &s;ome &s;trange chance or other, his reputation is only in the mouths of common readers. I have a &s;ingular in&s;tance of this to produce, in a poem which, I am confident, you never heard of, but which yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a merit &s;uperior to that of many pieces of the very fir&s;t celebrity. It hath pa&s;&s;ed thro eight editions from the year 1747, when it was publi&s;hed, to the pre&s;ent time; yet hath never been mentioned in any critical work whatever. The &s;tyle is &s;o much that of Shak|&s;pere, that, had he written in this &s;pecies of poetry, he could have adopted no other. To detain your curio&s;ity no longer, this wonderful production is called THE GRAVE, A POEM, and is written by Robert Blair, who was all epi&s;co|pal clergyman in Edinburgh.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="285">AS I am &s;ure you have never &s;een it, I beg leave to lay before you &s;ome of its mo&s;t beauti|ful pa&s;&s;ages, in order to rai&s;e your expectation to the highe&s;t, ere I &s;end you the poem it&s;elf. I admire this poem &s;o much, that I have pro|cured mo&s;t of the editions of it from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t; they have various readings; and I will &s;end you a copy with the mo&s;t remarkable written on the margin. In the mean time, in copying my extracts, I have preferred the readings which I thought be&s;t.</P>
<P>SOON after a proper introduction, the follow|ing &s;triking pa&s;&s;age appears:
<Q><L>See yonder hallow'd fane, the pious work</L>
<L>Of names once fam'd, now dubious, or forgot,</L>
<L>And buried mid&s;t the wreck of things which were;</L>
<L>There lie interred the more illu&s;trious dead.</L>
<L>The wind is up. Hark how it howls! Methinks</L>
<L>Till now I never heard a &s;ound &s;o dreary!</L>
<L>Doors creak, and windows clap, and night's foul bird,</L>
<L>Rook'd in the &s;pire, &s;creams loud: the gloomy ai&s;les,</L>
<L>Black plai&s;ter'd, and hung round with &s;hreds of &s;cutcheons,</L>
<L>And tatter'd coats of arms, &s;end back the &s;ound,</L>
<L>Laden with heavier airs, from the low vaults,</L>
<L><PB N="278" REF="286">The man&s;ions of the dead. Rouz'd from their &s;lumbers,</L>
<L>In grim array the grizly &s;pectres ri&s;e;</L>
<L>Grin horrible, and, ob&s;tinately &s;ullen,</L>
<L>Pa&s;s and repa&s;s, hu&s;h'd as the foot of Night.</L>
<L>Again the &s;creech-owl &s;hrieks! ungracious &s;ound!</L>
<L>I'll hear no more&mdash;it makes my blood run chill.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE following picture is a very natural and fine one:
<Q><L>OFT in the lone churchyard at night I've &s;een,</L>
<L>By glimp&s;e of moon&s;hine chequering thro the trees,</L>
<L>The &s;choolboy, with his &s;atchel in his hand,</L>
<L>Whi&s;tling aloud to bear his courage up;</L>
<L>And lightly tripping o'er the long flat &s;tones,</L>
<L>With nettles &s;kirted, and with mo&s;s o'ergrown,</L>
<L>That tell in homely phra&s;e who lie below.</L>
<L>Sudden he &s;tarts and hears, or thinks he hears,</L>
<L>The &s;ound of &s;omething purring at his heels.</L>
<L>Full fa&s;t he flies, and dares not look behind him,</L>
<L>Till out of breath he overtakes his fellows;</L>
<L>Who gather round, and wonder at the tale</L>
<L>Of horrid apparition, tall and gha&s;tly,</L>
<L>That walks at dead of night, or takes his &s;tand</L>
<L>O'er &s;ome new-open'd grave, and, &s;trange to tell!</L>
<L>Evani&s;hes at crowing of the cock.</L></Q>
<PB N="279" REF="287">This plea&s;ing picture is finely contra&s;ted by the following affecting one, which immedi|ately follows it:

<L>The pa&s;t endearments of their &s;ofter hours,</L>

<P>IN the above de&s;cription there are many minute &s;trokes that infer the &s;uperior poet: <HI>her now unta&s;ted cheek; She drops:</HI> to adopt the &s;ound to the action; <HI>bu&s;y meddling memory,</HI> an expre&s;&s;ion &s;o perfectly Shak&s;perian, yet not of Shak&s;pere.</P>

<P>THE pa&s;&s;age, on the death of the philo&s;o|pher, is exceeding well; as is that on the phy|&s;ician, but I need not repeat every beauty: this &s;troke in the la&s;t is quite Miltonic:

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>A POET may doubtle&s;s be too much an antiquary, when treating an ancient &s;ubject; but he may likewi&s;e be too little &s;o, and the la&s;t fault is the mo&s;t common; tho both extremes are equally prejudicial. If a poet hath too little &s;cience of antiquity, his ignorance di&s;gu&s;ts: and, if he hath, or rather &s;hews, too much, his pedantry is nau&s;eous.</P>
<P>THE &s;tudy of antiquity hath always appeared to me very uncertain; more e&s;pecially that relating to the ages before the Greek cla&s;&s;ics flouri&s;hed, and after the Roman period of litera|ture was &s;ucceeded by long centuries of gloomy ignorance. The &s;trong light which the Greek and Roman authors ca&s;t around them, &s;erves to expo&s;e the mo&s;t minute cu&s;tom to the eye: but in the night that &s;ucceeded, any object mu&s;t be very large indeed if it &s;trikes our view, till the morning of &s;cience again broke toward the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="294">THE period preceding the Greek cla&s;&s;ics is left to the full flight of the poet's imagination, providing he errs not again&s;t the <HI>co&s;tume</HI> of &s;uch nations as are de&s;cribed by ancient hi&s;torians. The latter period, which is indeed the period of chivalry, when the feudal &s;y&s;tem gave new forms to &s;ociety, confines the poet more; yet leaves a va&s;t field for bold fiction.</P>
<P>THE cu&s;toms and manners of feudal times were perfectly &s;imilar in mo&s;t countries. The knight who traver&s;ed the wild heaths and mountains of Scotland, was the &s;ame in his armour, his manners, his pur&s;uits, with him who paced over the fragrant vallies of Spain. They had travelled to the &s;ame courts, fought in the &s;ame tourneys; and perhaps adored the &s;ame mi&s;tre&s;s. Their ca&s;tles were built much in the &s;ame manner, and alike &s;ituated on an in&s;ulated rock &s;urrounded by a gloomy torrent, or on a commanding hill. The manners of the Spani&s;h knight might be imputed by any poet with &s;trict propriety, to the Scoti&s;h; and the contrary. If &s;uch poet were to de&s;cribe a ca&s;tle in England or Scotland, and it turned out to be upon the French, Italian, or Spani&s;h model
<PB N="287" REF="295">might it not be &s;aid with great ju&s;tice, that there mu&s;t have been many &s;uch ca&s;tles ac|tually exi&s;ting; the founders of them having preferred &s;uch models to tho&s;e of their own country? Are there not many peers in Great Britain, at this moment, who build their hou&s;es and live in every point after foreign fa&s;hions? Hence you &s;ee the ab&s;urdity of a poet's re&s;trict|ing him&s;elf too much to mere local antiquity; When fa&s;hion, caprice, and accident, are as an|cient as any antiquities in the world.</P>
<P>INDEED, no &s;cience whatever proceeds upon &s;uch uncertain grounds, as that of the antiquities of the re&s;pective countries of the world, during the middle ages. Our authori|ties are tho&s;e of romances, in which, for aught we know, cu&s;toms may be de&s;cribed which had no real exi&s;tence, on purpo&s;e to increa&s;e the marvellous; and tho&s;e of hi&s;torians of cre|dulous faith, and mean information. Much &s;cope is therefore left to the poet; and, if he errs not again&s;t the <HI>co&s;tume</HI> of greater notoriety, he is as likely to be right as any hi&s;torian, or romance-writer of the times; for, one will &s;ee objects more di&s;tinctly with a good tele&s;cope,
<PB N="288" REF="296">tho at &s;ome miles di&s;tance, than a per&s;on with bad natural organs of vi&s;ion can upon the &s;pot. If a poet, for in&s;tance, were to de&s;cribe Engli&s;h cuira&s;&s;iers at the battle of Azincour; tho &s;ome monki&s;h hi&s;torian were po&s;itively to &s;ay that there were none, I &s;hould prefer the poet's te&s;|timony to that of the cotemporary dunce; be|cau&s;e we have no relation of that battle by any writer who was pre&s;ent; if there was &s;uch relation, the writer might have omitted the circum&s;tance from &s;pite at &s;ome officer of tho&s;e cuira&s;&s;iers, or from forgetfulne&s;s; or the rela|tion it&s;elf might be altered and corrupted. If no faith is due, on &s;uch a particular point, to an eye witne&s;s, what is due to a monki&s;h hi&s;|torian, who heard it from an old woman, who heard it from a &s;erjeant who was at the battle? If a poet were even to de&s;cribe the French king as charging our troops on that occa&s;ion with his men drawn up in the Grecian phalanx, who &s;hall confute him? Is it not at lea&s;t as probable as that there is in the Briti&s;h army a regiment of cavalry who wear helmets of Greek form? yet the la&s;t is a fact. Fortune delights to blend times and circum&s;tances, as much as to alter them.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="297">NOTHING can be more ri&s;ible than to &s;ee a profe&s;&s;ed antiquary, from &s;ome &s;crap of an ancient writer, deciding upon the manners and cu&s;toms of a whole country and century: when perhaps the particular cu&s;tom mentioned was confined to a dozen of people, and totally va|ni&s;hed in &s;ix weeks. I wi&s;h the Memoirs of Scriblerus had extended to the feudal times; that the vapid &s;tudies of the mere antiquary might have been as much expo&s;ed to ridicule in re&s;pect to tho&s;e, as to the times of Greece and Rome.</P>

<P>YOUR dete&s;tation of modern Latin poetry cannot well exceed mine; yet, were all the works of it to be thrown into the fire, as you propo&s;e, there are one or two that I would ri&s;k burning my fingers to redeem. The Ba&s;ia of Secundus would be one of the&s;e, and indeed the only entire work: in other authors I &s;hould be content with two or three &s;elect leaves. The&s;e leaves &s;hould be torn only from the poems of Ca&s;imir Sorbiew&s;ky; with one leaf from tho&s;e of Menage, tho not written by that author, being the fable of Love and Folly, by the Pere Commire. I would tran&s;cribe it, but it is rather long; and Menage's poems are not uncommon; &s;o &s;hall content my&s;elf with recommending it to your peru&s;al, after ob&s;erv|ing that it is in the &s;imple &s;tyle of Phaedrus, which you &s;o de&s;ervedly admire.

How Vida came into reputation, is ea&s;ily ac|counted for. Pope, a boy of eighteen, and con&s;equently of little maturity of judgment, happened to light upon him at &s;ome dull hour
<PB N="292" REF="300">when in&s;ipidity it&s;elf appears bright; liked him, and prai&s;ed him to the &s;kies, in his E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m.

You know Pope loved modern Latin poetry &s;o much as to publi&s;h the Selecta Poemata Italorum, in two volumes; a work that does &s;till le&s;s credit to his critical abilities than his edition of Shak&s;pere.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid that in my opinion (I will not &s;ay <HI>humble,</HI> for that is a proud word) the Ba&s;ia of Secundus, two, or at mo&s;t three, odes of Ca&s;imir, and the fable of Commire con&s;titute all the modern Latin poetry that merits pre|&s;ervation; and I have read the poems of Fra|ca&s;torius, Amaltheus, Buchanauus, Grotius, Hein&s;ius, and all the men in <HI>us,</HI> as Moliere calls them, that ever &s;cribbled; together with tho&s;e of all the names in any other &s;yllable whatever to the number of many hundreds.

<P>THIS exqui&s;ite Ode is by no means in the Alcaic mea&s;ure, which Mr. Gray &s;eems to have intended it for.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>LUXURY and Literature, I confe&s;s, com|monly go hand in hand. In proportion as the mind becomes refined, the manners become &s;o likewi&s;e. The contrary is al&s;o true; for in proportion as the manners become luxurious, the mind grows refined; as liquors after fermentation run off pure. This was known to Marivaux, a great ma&s;ter in the &s;cience of mental luxury; he tells us, I think in his Marianne, <HI>que l'e&s;prit s'epure a proportion qu'il &s;e gate.</HI></P>
<P>LUXURY, my friend, is an invidious name, but is in it&s;elf the perfection of human nature. I mean not however the luxury of a bea&s;t, but that of a man. Temperance is the highe&s;t luxury under heaven, in every &s;en&s;e of the word. If luxury con&s;i&s;ts in the free u&s;e of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plea&s;ures, temperance is luxury; luxury in the extreme; luxury without &s;atiety. But this luxury is only known to the wi&s;e and
<PB N="317" REF="325">the good. The learned are not always wi&s;e and good. The luxury of a learned age is very frequently that luxury which confounds every &s;en&s;e by &s;aturating all; luxury in the penal acceptation of the word.</P>
<P>THIS luxury is merely comparative. The luxury of ancient times is barbaric penury to the pre&s;ent. I &s;peak of the ancient times of our own country. Britain will probably never ar|rive at the luxury of ancient Greece or Rome.</P>
<P>THE common idea that luxury is a &s;ure mark of a declining &s;tate is puerile; and wor|thy to be embraced by tho&s;e only who, as Lord Bacon &s;omewhere &s;ays, are not learned beyond certain common places. Luxury is commonly a token of the progre&s;s and vital health of a &s;tate; in &s;o much that when luxury declines, the &s;tate declines; as the decline of &s;pirits in the human body accompanies the de|cline of health. Few &s;tates ever atchieved any thing great till they were luxurious.</P>
<P>WHAT a paradox! you will &s;ay. Was an|cient Greece luxurious, when the fields of Marathon were dyed with the blood of the Per&s;ians?</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="326">YES it was. Ancient Greece was luxurious in the extreme, when the fields of Marathon were dyed with the blood of the Per&s;ians. Read Athenaeus, and you will learn that, at that period, the very mob of Athens walked the &s;treets in robes of &s;ilk, and with gra&s;shoppers of gold glittering in their hair. Their generals and officers were abandoned to a &s;en&s;uality that di&s;graces the name of man; and wallowed in all the bea&s;tline&s;s of vulgar luxury and riot.</P>
<P>THE learned men of Greece, tho&s;e, perpetual wonders of the world, as they tran&s;cended hu|manity in &s;ome things, fell below it in others. Pindar, E&s;chylus, Euripides, Sophocles, and others, we know for certainty, were given up entirely to a vice too black to mention. Socra|tes him&s;elf had different catamites be&s;ide Alci|biades; tho his pa&s;&s;ion for the la&s;t was the mo&s;t notorious. They who look upon their infamous loves as Platonic, only &s;hew their total ignorance of Grecian learning, and of Grecian manners. Athenaeus, who&s;e curious work every man &s;hould read with diligent at|tention, who wi&s;hes to form a per&s;onal ac|quaintance, if I may &s;o &s;peak, with the illu&s;|trious
<PB N="319" REF="327">men of Greece, is a &s;ure voucher of the&s;e facts, for he gives the words of cotemporary witne&s;&s;es, his work being indeed only a com|pilation. Grecian manners, as &s;hewn in the writings of their authors, did not regard this vice as of the &s;lighte&s;t moment. Sophocles and Euripides practi&s;ed it we know in the open fields around Athens, as we learn from their own epigrams pre&s;erved by Athenaeus. Ana|creon's odes &s;hew that the pa&s;&s;ion was looked, upon as equally innocent with legitimate love. Tho perhaps you may reject this la&s;t te&s;ti|mony; for, of late, &s;ome wi&s;eacres have di&s;co|vered that Anacreon's odes are not genuine, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, they are in a different &s;tyle from the fragments of &s;ome cotemporary of his, I forget whom. If you have not heard of this <HI>di&s;covery,</HI> I know you will laugh; but it is &s;e|rious. Oh! Oh! Well &s;aid Dan Chaucer,
<Q>The grete&s;t clerkes bene not the wi&s;e&s;t men.</Q>
What &s;hould we &s;ay to him who told us that Waller could not be cotemporary with Milton, becau&s;e their &s;tyle is quite di&s;&s;imilar; &s;o di&s;&s;i|milar, that ten centuries mu&s;t have elap&s;ed be|tween them? Did you ever hear of one Pere
<PB N="320" REF="328">Hardouin, a madman of learning (a common character), who tells us that Homer, Virgil, and Horace, were forged by monks in the twel&s;th century? This di&s;covery he made from their &s;tyle! In fact, no ancient can be known from his &s;tyle; for he is a poor writer who cannot command a hundred different &s;tyles.</P>
<P>TO return. Such was Greece in the day of her glory. Need I produce other in&s;tances to evince that luxury in its vulgar acceptation is the parent of great atchievments?</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on may haply be this: contempt of life mu&s;t produce any of the&s;e actions, in which life is evidently &s;et down by its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or as a mere trifle. Now this contempt is more certainly produced by luxury, than by the fero|cious &s;pirit of barbari&s;m. How! you will &s;ay; doth not luxury enervate a man, and make him a coward? The very contrary: it makes him brave.</P>
<P>TO explain this paradox: only con&s;ider what a <HI>taedium vitae,</HI> an <HI>ennui,</HI> luxury breeds; and you will not wonder that no man de&s;pi&s;es life &s;o much as the di&s;ciple of luxury, who hath
<PB N="321" REF="329">drunk of life till he is &s;ick. Men of temperance alone enjoy life, and feel its delight: men of luxury are the mo&s;t likely to be tho&s;e
<Q>Who &s;mile on death, and glory in the grave.</Q></P>
<P>PERSONAL courage indeed depends totally upon the animal &s;pirits. As the &s;pirits are in perpetual fluctuation, we need not wonder at a brave man on one occa&s;ion being a coward on another. Yet luxurious living, which ferments and exalts the &s;pirits, is certainly more likely to produce courage than the par&s;imony of tem|perance. Fal&s;taff you know, tells us, that warm blood begets warm thoughts.</P>
<P>THESE warm thoughts, my dear friend, will &s;ometimes do wonders in literature, as well as in war: and there are poets who&s;e pages have much of the true flavour of Burgundy. But corporeal luxury may beget works that fla&s;h for a moment: temperance, the mother of mental luxury, is the &s;upreme parent of great and wi&s;e productions.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="330">I HAVE &s;aid that Britain can never rival the luxury of ancient Greece or Rome. The cli|mate forbids it. A country where the means of luxury are natives of the &s;oil, will certainly be more luxurious, when a ju&s;t and equal go|vernment permits the enjoyment of her own ble&s;&s;ings, than a country in which the&s;e means are the produce of commerce.</P>
<P>IT follows not however that Britain mu&s;t yield to Greece in &s;cience, tho &s;cience is never widely diffu&s;ed till luxury is &s;o likewi&s;e; tho luxury is never carried to a height till &s;cience refines it. The rea&s;on is evident. Science re|lates to the mind, but luxury to the body. The mind acquires ideas of every luxury of every climate, tho its gro&s;&s;er companion can|not enjoy them.</P>
<P>IT is indeed ab&s;urd to lay down general rules upon any &s;ubject. Luxury may attain its height after the decline of a &s;tate, as well as during its greate&s;t elevation. Perhaps we are now more luxurious than during the AGE OF GEORGE THE SECOND; the period of the wide&s;t exten&s;ion and fame of our empire.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="331">THO literature hath, in the mo&s;t celebrated countries, attended with equal &s;teps the pro|gre&s;s of luxury; yet there are climates in which they have not appeared together. Na|ture loves to vary all her operations: the little folly of man only would confine her. His modes of acting are few. Tho&s;e of nature in|&s;inite. He delights in &s;y&s;tems. Nature knows no &s;y&s;tems.</P>

<PB N="324" REF="332">
<HEAD>LETTER XL.</HEAD>
<P>LORD BACON, in his admirable work, On the Advancement of Learning, pub|li&s;hed 1605, hath, with his u&s;ual amplitude of mind, pointed out in what parts human &s;cience was at that time deficient. From his hints many deficiencies have been &s;upplied &s;ince that period by writers of the fir&s;t merit: others &s;till remain in the &s;tate they were in that age. It will, I flatter my&s;elf, be an enquiry of infinite curio&s;ity and importance to &s;hew wherein knowlege, partly from that great man's ideas, partly from chance, and the natural advance|ment of the arts, hath been enriched &s;ince the publication of Lord Bacon's treati&s;e; and wherein it may &s;till be pronounced to be defi|cient; and in order to this, It will be fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to review Lord Bacon's plan.</P>
<P>HE divides learning into three parts, corre|&s;pondent to the three grand attributes of the mind: Hi&s;tory to the memory, Poe&s;y to the imagination, and Philo&s;ophy to the judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="333">HISTORY he divides into Natural, Civil, Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and Literary. The three fir&s;t he allows as extant, the la&s;t as deficient.</P>
<P>HE however afterwards &s;ubdivides NATURAL Hi&s;tory into three &s;orts; that of Nature in cour&s;e: that of Nature erring, or varying: and that of Nature altered, or wrought: that is, &s;ays he, Hi&s;tory of Creatures; Hi&s;tory of Mar|vails; and Hi&s;tory of Arts. The fir&s;t he notes as extant in perfection: the two latter are &s;o weakly treated that he remarks them as defi|cient.</P>
<P>CIVIL Hi&s;tory he divides into Memoirs: perfect Hi&s;tories; and Antiquities; which la&s;t he denominates remnants of hi&s;tory that have e&s;caped the &s;hipwreck of time. In the fir&s;t and la&s;t he can report no deficience, as being imper|fect in their very nature.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd &s;pecies, or perfect Hi&s;tory, he &s;ubdivides into Hi&s;tory of a Time, or <HI>Chronicle:</HI> of a Per&s;on, or <HI>Li&s;e;</HI> what we now call Biogra|phy: and of an Action, or <HI>Relation.</HI> All of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es he allows deficient in his own country.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="334">ECCLESIASTICAL Hi&s;tory, which is indeed that of human madne&s;s, need not be in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>HE then enumerates what he calls <HI>appendices</HI> to Hi&s;tory: the&s;e are Apothemes, Orations, and Letters. His remark on the la&s;t I mu&s;t beg leave to quote. <Q>Such Letters as are written for wi&s;e men are of all the words of men, in my judgment, the be&s;t; for they are more natural than orations, and public &s;peeches; and more advi&s;ed than conferences, or pre&s;ent &s;peeches.</Q> In the&s;e he hath no deficiencies to propound.</P>
<P>IN Poetry he can report no defect, it having no progre&s;s.</P>
<P>PHILOSOPHY he divides into Divine, Natural, and Human. Leaving the fri&s;t to &s;upernatural heads, we &s;hall proceed to the &s;econd, which he &s;ays con&s;i&s;ts in Natural Science, and Natural Prudence. Natural Science he &s;ubdivides into Phy&s;ic, and Metaphy&s;ic: the fir&s;t the knowlege of matter, of all that has only being and me|tion; the la&s;t that of &s;pirit, mind, ab&s;tract idea. In Phy&s;ic he can find no defect; for many au|thers had written on it, tho with what truth he pretends not to determine.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="335">METAPHYSIC relates to forms and qualities; as colours, vegetation, gravity, levity, tenuity, den&s;ity, hear, cold, &amp;c. and, &s;econdly, to final cau&s;es; as, if the leaves of trees are meant to protect the fruit, &amp;c. The fir&s;t he brands as deficient; the latter he allows extant, but wi&s;hes it confined to its prober place.</P>
<P>HE adds to Natural Science that of Mathe|matics, in which he ob&s;erves no deficience.</P>
<P>NATURAL Prudence, or the practical part of Natural Philo&s;ophy, he divides into Experimen|tal; Philo&s;ophic, or that ari&s;ing from a know|lege of Phy&s;ical cau&s;es; and Magical, which he &s;eems &s;o to denominate as, from pro&s;ound di&s;|covery, being capable of operations, thought &s;upernatural; as the prolongation of life beyond the natural term, &amp;c. This he reports as de|fective.</P>
<P>IN treating of Natural Prudence he recom|mends An Inventory of the E&s;tate of Man, con|taining all the inventions extant; from which will follow a ju&s;t idea of what is not yet in|vented.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="336">HE adds to Natural Philo&s;ophy a divi&s;ion of Doubts or Problems, general and particular: the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ting of opinions of philo&s;ophers not yet fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, or refuted; the la&s;t of problems like tho&s;e of Ari&s;totle; after, from experiments, &amp;c. only doubt, and not clear truth, could ari&s;e. In this he recommends a Calendar of Popular Errors.</P>
<P>WE are now happily arrived at what he improperly calls HUMAN Knowlege, by which he means the KNOWLEGE OF OURSELVES: a part of &s;cience of the highe&s;t u&s;e and dignity; and to which all the re&s;t are but trifles. This he divides into two grand heads, the Knowlege of Man &s;egregate, or con&s;idered as an individual; and Civil knowlege, or the &s;cience of &s;ociety and government.</P>
<P>THE de&s;iciencies noted in the fir&s;t are Medi|cinal Hi&s;tory, or Narrations of Ca&s;es: omi&s;&s;ions in Anatomy: ra&s;h pronounciations by Phy&s;icians upon di&s;ea&s;es: impropriety of receipts, &amp;c. all mere trifles in compari&s;on of what might be expected from &s;uch an Author.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="337">KNOWLEGE of the Mind he divides into two parts; that of the Nature, and that of the Facul|ties of the &s;oul. The fir&s;t he confe&s;&s;es beyond the &s;phere of human &s;cience. Divination and Fa&s;cination he adds to this as &s;mall appendices; fooli&s;hly enough, for there are, without doubt, no &s;uch things in being. They &s;hould have fallen under the head of Poetry.</P>
<P>THE knowlege of the Faculties of the Mind he likewi&s;e &s;ubdivides into two kinds; that of the Under&s;tanding, and that of the Pa&s;&s;ions; or Rational and Moral.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t contains the Four intellectual arts: that of enquiry, or invention; that of exami|nation, or judgment; that of cu&s;tody, or me|mory; and that of elocution, or tradition. In|vention relates to arts; and to &s;peech and argu|ments, or rhetoric and logic; over which the province of Judgment likewi&s;e extends. He con&s;iders Memory; then pa&s;&s;es to Tradition, which is either by &s;peech or writing, to it therefore belong Grammar and Rhetoric: he here treats of the methods of communicating knowlege, and recommends the Socratic plan
<PB N="330" REF="338">of leaving every thing in doubt; this he calls <HI>methodus &s;incerus, &s;ive ad filios &s;cientiarum.</HI> After &s;ome hints on Rhetoric, he pa&s;&s;es to two appen|dices to the Tradition of &s;cience; one of which he calls Critical, and the other Pedantic know|lege. The fir&s;t he divides into five points.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Editing and correcting books.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Annota|tions explaining them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Knowlege of the times in which the books were written.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Judgment on Authors, pointing out what books de&s;erve reading, what not.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The di&s;|po&s;ition of &s;tudies, or in what order books ought to be read.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>PEDANTIC knowlege, or that of a &s;chool|ma&s;ter admits four divi&s;ions.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Timing of knowlege,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Progre&s;s from ea&s;y authors to difficult.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Knowlege of the difference of talents.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Exerci&s;e: under which head he includes manners, and education in general.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>MORAL PHILOSOPHY he con&s;iders at &s;ore length; and with his u&s;ual &s;trength and accu|racy except in &s;ome compliments to James I. to whom his work is addre&s;&s;ed, and who was the mo&s;t fooli&s;h and ba&s;e prince who ever di&s;|graced a throne.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="339">SOCIAL SCIENCE he next con&s;iders, with great wi&s;dom, under the heads of Conver&s;ation, and of Bu&s;ine&s;s. His thoughts on this mo&s;t important head are happily given in no very contracted bounds; and are almo&s;t worth the whole large work of Charron. I look upon this as by far the mo&s;t valuable part of his mo&s;t valuable performance.</P>
<P>THE other head of CIVIL KNOWLEGE, or that of Government and Laws, he treats with timid brevity; and it is no wonder when writ|ing to a king, and to an ideot king.</P>
<P>DIVINE Learning, or Divinity, is the final part of his work; and on this he writes mere non&s;en&s;e like Milton, and other great men, who&s;e prejudices were too &s;trong for all their talents; or who thought, <HI>loquendum ut vulgus, &s;entiendum ut &s;apientes.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH is the Analy&s;is and very &s;oul of this great work. Let us now proceed to what was propo&s;ed in the beginning of this Letter; and endeavour to point out in what parts &s;cience hath been improved &s;ince its publication, and
<PB N="332" REF="340">in what parts it is yet deficient: an undertak|ing which, if executed in its due extent, would be worthy of &s;ome Bacon of this age, if &s;uch there can ari&s;e; and were of the very fir&s;t im|portance to mankind of any literary labours whatever. This is meant as an apology for the &s;light attempt to be made in this Letter, which, it is hoped, you will receive with your u&s;ual indulgence of friend&s;hip: for even &s;uper|ficial hints on &s;uch a &s;ubject are of no &s;mall daring. Yet literary courage and &s;pirit of di&s;|covery you have not &s;eldom imputed to your friend. Rinaldo indeed, you told him lately, was his model, when you quoted
<Q><L>E volge intorno gli occhi, e quella &s;trada</L>
<L>Sol gli piace tentar, ch'altri di&s;pera.</L></Q>
Let him plead in excu&s;e the&s;e equal lines in the very next &s;tanza:
<Q><L>Ogni ri&s;chio al valor &s;empre &egrave; &s;ecuro;</L>
<L>Tutte le vie &s;on piane a gli animo&s;i.</L></Q>
Courage! If he fails, write on his epi&s;tolary e&s;&s;ay, <HI>Magnis tamen excidit au&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>WITHOUT further pre&s;ace, the fir&s;t &s;ubdivi|&s;ion of Natural Hi&s;tory, tho con&s;idered as extant by Lord Bacon, he means in Pliny, Ge&s;ner, and
<PB N="333" REF="341">Aldrovandus, hath received &s;uch va&s;t improve|ments, &s;ince his time, by the labours of Buf|fon, and other eminent Naturali&s;ts, that it evi|dently appears that he had been ra&s;h in mark|ing it as not deficient. Botany, in particular, hath acquired a new and &s;cientific form by the univer&s;al adoption of the Linnaean or &s;exual &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd &s;ubdivi&s;ion, on Hi&s;tory of Won|ders in nature, is yet wanting, tho in the Phi|lo&s;ophic Tran&s;actions, and el&s;ewhere, are funds, properly evidenced, for at lea&s;t a fir&s;t volume of &s;uch a work; than which nothing could well be more intere&s;ting, even to the idle and the ignorant.</P>
<P>IN the hi&s;tory of Arts, France hath done &s;o much as almo&s;t to move me to a&s;&s;ume Lord Bacon's authority, and put it down as no longer defective. The hi&s;tory of mo&s;t arts may now be found either in the Encyclopedie; or pub|li&s;hed &s;eparately by men of &s;kill.</P>
<P>IN Civil Hi&s;tory the article of Memoirs was defective in England in Lord Bacon's time.
<PB N="334" REF="342">France indeed had Joinville, Froi&s;&s;art, Com|mines: Italy Guicciardini. There are no an|cient Memoirs of cla&s;&s;ic times, &s;ave tho&s;e of Xenophon and Cae&s;ar. But the article was deficient, and is &s;till in this country. The Scoti&s;h authors in this way are pretty nume|rous: Melville hath va&s;t merit in every view; Burnet's Memoirs, or, as he calls them, Hi&s;tory of his Own Time, may be pronounced the very be&s;t work on our hi&s;tory yet extant. His ta|lents and hone&s;ty are &s;o great, that I agree with Henry Fielding that he is the chief of our hi&s;|torical writers, tho he be &s;ometimes too credu|lous; as, for in&s;tance, in relating the death of James the Second's &s;on, whom he thought &s;uppo&s;ititious. The laughers who are wits to fools, and fools to men of wit, were again&s;t him: Pope and Bolingbroke, and the whole of that dete&s;table Jacobite &s;et, united their &s;tronge&s;t efforts to depre&s;s the work with too much &s;ucce&s;s: and &s;ome pitiful curs of our own time have joined in the cry. But if Bur|net's Memoirs are not very &s;oon univer&s;ally read and admired, this country will &s;peedily become a province of France. Dr. John&s;on hath ju&s;tly prai&s;ed his fine &s;tyle; that of his
<PB N="335" REF="343">Hi&s;tory is excellent, and hath all the &s;trength and clearne&s;s of Hume, without his barbari&s;ms. You will ob&s;erve that I do not look upon the work of Thuanus as Memoirs, but as univer&s;al hi&s;tory: it is not in the &s;tyle of Memoirs, as Burnet's Hi&s;tory is. Chronological abridg|ments of Hi&s;tory are highly valuable; but mu&s;t be written with quite different talents from tho&s;e of Henault, who&s;e work is without ta&s;te and without knowlege. It has &s;old however&mdash; becau&s;e he was a Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>ANTIQUITIES, in Lord Bacon's acceptation, relate, as he expre&s;&s;es it, &s;olely to fragments that have e&s;caped the &s;hipwreck of time. Such are the parts of Diodorus Siculus and of Polybius that have reached us. Antiquities, in our modern phra&s;eology, imply all that is properly the pro|vince of an Antiquary; the &s;cience of ancient cu&s;toms, manners, buildings, dre&s;&s;es, coins, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. This &s;cience, when applied to man and manners, is very amu&s;ing and entertaining; and as it has e&s;caped Lord Bacon, allow me to put it down as an appendix to civil hi&s;tory; and only de&s;icient in Lord Bacon's &s;en&s;e, when &s;peaking of what he calls Antiquities, that is as imper|fect in its very nature, and always admitting of further di&s;covery.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="344">THE &s;cience of Medals forms another appen|dix to civil Hi&s;tory, and that of the fir&s;t impor|tance, as they afford the &s;tronge&s;t collateral evidence of its truth that can be given. It is &s;urprizing this elegant &s;tudy is not more gene|ral, for it certainly &s;tands very high in the cla&s;s of &s;cientific amu&s;ements. Nay the philo&s;opher who writes, or peru&s;es hi&s;tory, for that greate&s;t of purpo&s;es, the knowlege of human manners, will learn more from medals than from the be&s;t hi&s;tories.</P>
<P>ANOTHER appendix to civil hi&s;tory let me mark in Parochial and County Hi&s;tory; and that of particular towns and villages, which like the former will always be defective. Many ingenious men have however laboured very much in it of late.</P>
<P>TRAVELS ought to have been noted as a &s;mall appendix to Memoirs, being indeed Me|moirs of a per&s;on's life for the time he was upon his journey. The credulity and igno|rance of ancient travellers are now fallen into de&s;erved contempt; and men travel who carry philo&s;ophy and ta&s;te, and knowlege of hurnan
<PB N="337" REF="345">nature, along with them. Many excellent books of voyages and travels now grace the Engli&s;h tongue in particular. The travels of Brydone are even full of &s;ublime de&s;cription; and would have been the fir&s;t book of the kind, had not the Publi&s;her forced him to make two volumes of what he had written in one. Hence his letter on comets is as con|temptible as his letter on Etna is admirable.</P>
<P>LORD BACON well marks Perfect Hi&s;tory as deficient in his own country, in all its branches of what we call General hi&s;tory, Biography, and Hi&s;tory of a particular event. He regrets in particular the want of a Hi&s;tory of England, and another of Scotland. The fir&s;t is yet wanting, for all hi&s;tories yet written will mi&s;|lead, and not in&s;truct any friend to the liberties of his country; the Rhap&s;ody of Mrs. Macaulay being no exception. The latter is not much better; for Robert&s;on is only a biographer on a larger &s;cale.</P>
<P>BRITISH Biography is a province &s;u&s;ceptible of much improvement, tho we have the Bio|graphia Britannica; a work unhappily confined by its &s;ize to great libraries.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="346">WE, have no Event related on the plan of Salu&s;t, tho the French have, in the Hi&s;tory of the Spani&s;h Con&s;piracy at Venice, by the Abb&eacute; de St. Real.</P>
<P>MR. GIBBON hath perhaps given birth to a new kind of Hi&s;tory, comprehending all Lord Bacon's divi&s;ions of perfect hi&s;tory; for The Hi&s;tory of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is the relation of a va&s;t Event, extend|ing to the form of a Chronicle, and compriz|ing Biography; as the life of a, Roman empe|ror is in fact the Hi&s;tory of the Roman world during his reign. His two fir&s;t volumes are well written, tho not without &s;mall faults, &s;uch as his &s;eeming utterly to forget that there was &s;uch a writer as Plutarch, and &s;uch a prince as Titus in the world: and the chapters on Chri&s;tianity; which, not to &s;ay they are foreign to his work, are va&s;tly too long. His four la&s;t volumes (I &s;peak of the octavo edition) betray a jaded attention. He is evidently fa|tigued with his &s;ubject; and of con&s;equence imagines the reader mu&s;t be &s;o: to relieve him he gravely tells &s;tories of miracles, &amp;c. think|ing to amu&s;e; but non&s;en&s;e doth not amu&s;e.
<PB N="339" REF="347">The &s;tyle is rather incorrect likewi&s;e in the&s;e four volumes; which are evidently written for &s;ale, as the fir&s;t two are for fame; it is even &s;ometimes puerile, as where he &s;peaks of an emperor being di&s;tingui&s;hed no le&s;s by the <HI>pre|eminence</HI> of his rank; than by the <HI>preeminence</HI> of his fear of a barbaric inva&s;ion. In the next page, however, is to be found the mo&s;t &s;ublime metaphor I have ob&s;erved in any hi&s;torian. His Conclu&s;ion is pitiably unfortunate; and more worthy of an old woman, who had been frighted into hy&s;terics by reading a &s;ixpenny hi&s;tory of the &s;ack of Rome by Alaric, than of a man of &s;cience. He &s;eems even to forget that America teems with more barbarians (his bug|bears) than all the re&s;t of the world put toge|ther. Let him revi&s;e his Hi&s;tory, and it will &s;tand among the very fir&s;t in the world. Above all things let him be le&s;s a Geographer, and more a Chronologer. Geography and Chronology have well been called the two eyes of Hi&s;tory; but he has extingui&s;hed the latter, as hoping the other would &s;hine more brightly.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="348">SUCH are the faults that have occurred to me in that grand work; which, when com|pleted in its utmo&s;t extent, will with all its blemi&s;hes be a noble acce&s;&s;ion to the trea&s;ures of Engli&s;h literature. Nothing but my high regard for the work and its author could have induced me to &s;o particular a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; for none but works of the fir&s;t order de&s;erve to have their errors pointed out, for tho&s;e of others will not mi&s;lead.</P>
<P>A MOST important acce&s;&s;ion hath lately been made to the province of Hi&s;tory by the philo|&s;ophic &s;pirit, that is daily &s;preadiug to every corner of the world, and every branch of &s;ci|ence. This hath induced latter hi&s;torians to blend the intere&s;ting hi&s;tory of &s;ociety and manners with the dry detail of true facts, and imaginary cau&s;es. This is an improvement which even the prophetic genius of Bacon could not for&s;ee; and &s;hews that Time is the greate&s;t of philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>A BOOK of Apothemes, and even an excel|lent collection of je&s;ts and &s;trokes of wit, are yet wanting in our language; tho the latter
<PB N="341" REF="349">would, if executed by a man of ta&s;te and &s;elec|tion, be as amu&s;ing as the former would be in&s;tructive. Plutarch hath collected the apo|themes of the ancients; Cae&s;ar had collected a book of je&s;ts: as Poggius hath done &s;ince in Latin, Dominichi in Italian, and Melchior de Santa Cruz in Spani&s;h. The amu&s;ements of Julius Cae&s;ar cannot be unworthy of a man of the fir&s;t fame and talents: and it lies with the collector, and not with the &s;ubject, that our je&s;t-books are confined to the &s;tall.</P>
<P>IN the Epi&s;tolary Style we have Howel, a writer of wonderful merit, and by no means &s;o much e&s;teemed as he ought to be; and Mr. Melmoth, who in his Letters of Sir Thomas Fitz-O&s;borne hath merit, and hath met with proportionable e&s;teem, in &s;pite of his Greek names, which make the work look like a ro|mance of Queen Elizabeth's time. I need not &s;peak of Lady M. W. Montague, who&s;e Let|ters are, in my opinion, much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the Marchione&s;s de Sevign&eacute;, tho both have the very fir&s;t claim to public prai&s;e that any woman's work can have, that of not being written for public prai&s;e. The letters of our

<P>THE improvements and advances, both of what Lord Bacon calls the Phy&s;ical and Meta|phy&s;ical parts of Natural Philo&s;ophy, have &s;ince his time been amazing, and mo&s;tly in con&s;e|quence of the hints of this profound writer. Mr. Walpole, in his admirable Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors, calls Bacon the prophet of arts, which Newton was afterwards &s;ent to reveal. Yet Bacon was not merely a <HI>vox clamantis in de&s;erto,</HI> as a wag &s;aid a preacher to empty benches was; but actually made many experiments to a&s;certain his own philo|&s;ophy; to one of which he fell a martyr. The &s;y&s;tem of Des Cartes hath ri&s;en and &s;allen &s;ince Bacon; that of Newton hath ri&s;en and keeps its ground. Galileo hath improved A&s;|tronomy; and others have almo&s;t perfected it,
<PB N="343" REF="351">till a new planet, concomitant of the earth, hath been within the&s;e very few years di&s;co|vered. Why &s;hould I &s;peak of the thermome|ter, the barometer, and a thou&s;and &s;uch inven|tions; or of electricity and electric fire, a new power, and new element, if I may &s;o call it, tho it is in fact the element of fire, before only known materially? Why &s;hould I mention all the minute inventions, ari&s;ing from experimen|tal philo&s;ophy, of which Lord Bacon is the father; and to be found in the Philo&s;ophic Tran&s;actions, and Memoirs of innumerable fo|reign academies? This you know is a letter not a treati&s;e. I &s;hall content my&s;elf with ob&s;erving that Natural Science and Natural Prudence, tho &s;eparated by Lord Bacon, have been &s;ince wedded; and have produced a great number of very fine and healthy children.</P>
<P>THE Inventory of the E&s;tate of Man, than which nothing could well be more curious and intere&s;ting, is yet wanting to the world; tho its plan doth not &s;eem of extremely difficult execution.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="352">BROWN hath happily executed a Calendar, or Catalogue, of Vulgar Errors, tho in a mo&s;t pedantic &s;tyle of Latin Engli&s;h, and which hath, to the great credit of our ta&s;te, been re|vived in England, after being dead a whole century.</P>
<P>UNDER the article of Mathematics it might have been noted, that the invention of Logar|rithms, about Five years after the publication of Lord Bacon's book, hath greatly facilitated the &s;olution of que&s;tions in this &s;cience. Navi|gation, Geometry, &amp;c. have likewi&s;e received many improvements, both minute and impor|tant; tho it would extend this Letter to too great a length to enumerate the&s;e improve|ments. I ha&s;ten therefore to the mo&s;t impor|tant part of Lord Bacon's work, and of human &s;cience, which is</P>
<P>THE KNOWLEGE THAT IMMEDIATELY RELATES TO MAN HIMSELF, CONSIDERED AS AN INDIVIDUAL, AND AS A MEMBER OF SOCIETY.</P>
<P>LET me make one prefatory ob&s;ervation on this greate&s;t branch of human knowlege,
<PB N="345" REF="353">which is, that it hath ever moved my highe&s;t wonder that, while Sir I&s;aac Newton, and other men of the large&s;t genius and mo&s;t &s;evere fa|culties, have pointed the whole ardor of their minds to theories of worlds, of gravitation, colours, and other baubles, of no more con&s;e|quence to man than a collection of butterflies; this, almo&s;t the only part of &s;cience that is of importance to human kind, &s;hould remain de&s;ert and uncultivated. Surely nothing can be a more humiliating in&s;tance of human folly than that men, and men of talents, &s;hould neglect the only province of wi&s;dom that im|mediately intere&s;ts mankind; and &s;hould &s;eem to prefer a parcel of idle and airy &s;peculations to the grande&s;t part of human knowlege; that which tends to make man wi&s;er, better, and happier; to improve &s;ociety, and government; and in&s;titute a paradi&s;e upon earth.</P>
<P>TO de&s;cend to the &s;maller divi&s;ions of this ONLY TRUE KNOWLEGE, &s;ome of which how|ever are trifling in re&s;pect of others:</P>
<P>THE deficiencies of Medicine need not be noted, as it is all one defect.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="354">LOCKE'S Treati&s;e upon Human Under&s;tand|ing is a mo&s;t acute work, but tends not to increa&s;e the practical wi&s;dom of man. The nature, progre&s;s, and exertion, of ideas are merely &s;peculations, and have a great chance of fal&s;ity; for we confe&s;&s;edly know nothing of the nature of the mind, which is their produc|tor. It is the proper application of ideas that man needs to be in&s;tructed in. What is it to me from what rarifications of earth the gold of this guinea is formed? The point is, how am I to u&s;e it with propriety &s;o as to benefit my&s;elf and others?</P>
<P>THE whole divi&s;ions of Rational Knowlege are &s;till deficient; and will be, till &s;ome men of va&s;t talents apply to them, and not with a &s;peculative, but with a practical bent of mind.</P>
<P>THE appendices of Rational Knowlege, be|ing Critical and Pedantic &s;cience, have received great improvements, e&s;pecially in England, &s;ince the publication of the work On the Ad|vancement of Learning: yet deficiencies may &s;till be noted. A general collection of critical ob&s;ervations would be of much utility, where
<PB N="347" REF="355">a &s;y&s;tem were ridiculous. Elements of Criti|ci&s;m form a good title, but a woeful book: full of fal&s;e Elements and fal&s;e Critici&s;m. Blair's Lectures on the Belles Lettres are no better; he being the mere ape of the French critics, and never venturing beyond his leading|&s;trings. It is indeed the great fault of our critics that they &s;o &s;eldom think for them&s;elves. The two Wartons are almo&s;t the only critics we have who have &s;hewn a genuine ta&s;te.</P>
<P>PEDANTIC knowlege hath however made &s;lower advances than critici&s;m, tho it is of in|finitely more con&s;equence. When will man acquire wi&s;dom enough to leave the pur&s;uit of big trifles for that of &s;mall things that mo&s;t import him?</P>
<P>THE &s;y&s;tem of education is &s;till fooli&s;h. Rou&s;&s;eau hath pointed out &s;ome improvements, but a defect almo&s;t in&s;eparable from great views is, that they are always wa&s;ted in &s;pecu|lation. Hence few of his remarks can be of any practical u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="356">ONE of the mo&s;t glaring defects in the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of Pedantic Science is, the great time wa&s;ted in acquiring dead languages, which, in nine ca&s;es out of ten, are of no u&s;e to the child, but in fact are quite neglected and forgotten by him in a few months after he hath left &s;chool. Perfection of folly! To wa&s;te the mo&s;t precious years of human life in acquiring u&s;ele&s;s lan|guages, and languages that are to be forgotten! O <HI>caecas hominum mentes!</HI> Where a boy is in|tended for any of the learned profe&s;&s;ions, or is heir of an ea&s;y fortune, the &s;tudy of languages is proper; but in this order: one year for the Engli&s;h; one year for the Greek; one year for three other tongues, the Latin, Italian, and French: but, while &s;tudying the&s;e languages, they &s;hould be con&s;idered as amu&s;ements, and relaxations, as learning the French is now, while the ART OF BEING A MAN &s;hould be con&s;idered as the bu&s;ine&s;s of a boy's education. Dome&s;tic and Social Wi&s;dom; Virtue and Hanpine&s;s; all the hone&s;t arts of making life delightful, re&s;pectable, and important to &s;o|ciety; the&s;e ought to form the e&s;&s;ence and great object of education. It is a trite ob&s;erva|tion, that girls arrive &s;ooner at womanly man|ners
<PB N="349" REF="357">and knowlege, than boys do at the man|ners and knowlege proper for their &s;ex. This is a&s;cribed to Nature having a&s;&s;igned a previous maturity to females. The fact is, it is the con|&s;equence of the different modes of education. A girl is doing the honours of the table, and winning every body by her poli&s;hed conver&s;a|tion, while a boy is blubbering over an u&s;ele&s;s book. His being a man all his life is of no con&s;equence, provided he is a &s;cholar for a few years!&mdash;Prejudice! Prejudice! When will the happy period arrive that humankind &s;hall break thy dete&s;table &s;hackles, only &s;trong from the weakne&s;s of the wearers! When will the awful voice of Nature &s;ound to the human mind, Be free!</P>
<P>IN Moral Philo&s;ophy and Social Science, the&s;e greate&s;t divi&s;ions of this grand part of knowlege, few or no advances have been made. The le&s;&s;er morals have perhaps been improved by the Spectator, and other works of the kind, being univer&s;ally read: and the importance even of the lea&s;t points of morality is &s;o great that I believe every man of a &s;ound and bene|volent mind will agree, that there is more real
<PB N="350" REF="358">glory in having written two pages that have actually taught mankind how to be virtuous and happy, than in compo&s;ing whole &s;y&s;tems of &s;peculation; more illu&s;trious fame ari&s;ing from one of Mr. Addi&s;on's papers in the Spec|tator, than from the whole works of Sir I&s;aac Newton, even tho he had demon&s;trated an acute and &s;tupendous theory of deity it&s;elf.</P>
<P>CIVIL Knowlege, or that of Government and Laws, hath certainly admitted no &s;mall improvements &s;ince Lord Bacon's age. Not only books of merit have been written upon the&s;e points; but, what is of far higher mo|ment, the practical operation of Government and Laws hath in mo&s;t kingdoms been ren|dered more beneficial. It is amazing indeed to con&s;ider how widely philo&s;ophy hath &s;pread the light of liberty and happine&s;s over great part of the world within a &s;hort period of time. The reduction of the papal power in many of the kingdoms where it was mo&s;t predominant is, in particular, a grand epoch of the triumph of &s;cience over folly and fanatici&s;m. What may we not hope when &s;uch is the beginning of the reign of Philo&s;ophy? A perpetual peace among
<PB N="351" REF="359">all the powers of Europe, in which every u&s;e|ful and elegant art &s;hall be carried to a perfec|tion unknown even to the dreams of vi&s;ionaries, might almo&s;t no longer be regarded as an idle imagination.</P>
<P>WITH regard to theoretical knowlege of Laws and Government, the work of Monte&s;|quieu de&s;erves mention, tho its brief, and appa|rently deep and dictatorial &s;tyle hath acquired it infinitely more fame than it de&s;erves. The treati&s;es of Millar and Fergu&s;on on Civil So|ciety have merit, tho by no means of the fir&s;t kind: the la&s;t author in particular being the drye&s;t whom I ever remember to have read; in&s;omuch that the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubjects lo&s;e all intere&s;t in his frigid pages.</P>
<P>CAN I pa&s;s the &s;ubject of Government and Laws without expre&s;&s;ing an ardent with for a reform of tho&s;e of our yet happy country; for tho her &s;un be &s;et, as &s;tate&s;men tell us, yet it is a very fine evening, and promi&s;es a future bright day. That a CODE OF ENGLISH LAW &s;hould never yet be thought of by the legi&s;la|ture, is one of the &s;trange&s;t in&s;tances of the
<PB N="352" REF="360">melancholy truth, that human affairs are go|verned by Chance, and not by Wi&s;dom. But God forbid that it &s;hould be attempted during this tory reign, in which we behold judges carrying politics into the bench of impartial ju&s;tice, as violently as in the reign of James II. in &s;pite of the infamy of Jeffries which awaits them. In|deed, it may &s;afely be &s;aid that the laws of this country are either a di&s;grace to the con&s;titution, or the con&s;titution to the laws; for it is a cer|tain fact, however paradoxical it may &s;eem, that they are often in direct oppo&s;ition to each other. To in&s;tance in one point, it is a maxim in the law, as tories tell us, that the king can do no wrong. By the con&s;titution of this country, according to two precedents, the king can not only do wrong, but be put to death, as Charles I. or bani&s;hed, as James II. according to the of|fence. But I forget that I am talking of our liberties, after they are ACTUALLY LOST from this very cau&s;e of the laws being de&s;tructive of the con&s;titution: for ca&s;es of libel, or of trea|&s;on, are the mo&s;t delicate and chief objects be|tween prince and &s;ubject; and, thanks to our Jacobite judges, <HI>an information</HI> is lodged ex <HI>offi|cio</HI> by the Attorney General, a <HI>Special Jury</HI> is
<PB N="353" REF="361">packed by the judge, and mu&s;t obey his com|mands; if they, fail in any point, they are browbeaten, and taught to know better; and thus every &s;ubject who &s;teps forth to defend the rights of his brethren, is the &s;lave of the &s;lave of the king. Thus it is in the power of any prince, who &s;hall even want common fa|culties, to overturn our con&s;titution, and en&s;lave us by our own laws. Monte&s;quieu hath ob|&s;erved, that no &s;tate can be free in which the laws of trea&s;on are not mo&s;t accurately defined in every point, becau&s;e upon them the very ex|i&s;tence of liberty depends. Now in our <HI>happy and glorious</HI> con&s;titution, the laws of trea&s;on are quite inaccurate. Indeed, whoever will examine our con&s;titution and laws together, will pro|nounce both to be very imperfect; and if we are not &s;laves the cau&s;e is in our brea&s;ts, and hands; not in our con&s;titution, nor our laws. Before our con&s;titution can be called perfect, the king mu&s;t by law re&s;ign one half of his pre&s;ent power and patronage; which he may do without the &s;lighte&s;t danger of an Ari&s;to|cracy ri&s;ing on his ruins. That this was not done on the acce&s;&s;ion of William III. or of George I. to the throne is an eternal di&s;grace
<PB N="354" REF="362">to the judgment of our National Councils. In the later event e&s;pecially, if the very title of King was given, nothing was too great to a&s;k, or rather to keep.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING the laws rendered perfect, who can afford to pay for them? Sweet laws that cannot be admini&s;tered without ruining the oppre&s;t! It is to he hoped that in the cour&s;e of a <HI>century</HI> or <HI>two,</HI> we &s;hall have wi&s;dom enough to reduce the fees of courts and lawyers to one tenth of what they are now. And when re|formation once begins, it precipitates; &s;o that, whenever that event takes place, we may ven|ture to prophe&s;y, that in the cour&s;e of a year thereafter the&s;e fees will be reduced to one|thirtieth part of the pre&s;ent, which would yet be too high.</P>
<P>LET me add that <HI>Police,</HI> in particular, a word unknown to the Engli&s;h language, and to the Engli&s;h laws, is woefully deficient in this enormous metropolis. Why is not the price of meat, for in&s;tance, regulated as that of bread? Our wi&s;e &s;enators are &s;o much occupted with game-laws, that they cannot be&s;tow the
<PB N="355" REF="363">mo&s;t trifling attention on the lives and proper|ties of their con&s;tituents; when, God knows, it matters not the to&s;&s;ing up of a &s;traw if there were not a bird of game in the three kingdoms, or bea&s;t of game, except the hunters. The Criminal Laws of Britain are much too mur|derous; and &s;eem utterly to forget that there are puni&s;hments more dreadful than death even to the meane&s;t mind.</P>
<P>SUCH are my ha&s;ty thoughts on this grand &s;ubject of the Progre&s;s of Knowlege. Sen&s;ible of their defects, I even &s;ubmit them with anxiety to the judgment of your affectionate friend&s;hip.</P>

<P>P. S. YOU will perhaps think a former a&s;&s;ertion of this Letter extravagant; namely, that the &s;tudy of Burnet's Hi&s;tory is connected with the welfare of our &s;tate. But it only means that the true and old Whig principles are e&s;&s;ential to that welfare; and that if the&s;e prevail, Burnet will be read with admiration. As for the new Whig principles, they have done as much harm to the con&s;titution as toryi&s;m.

<HEAD>LETTER XLI.</HEAD>
<P>YOU rightly ob&s;erve that the fewne&s;s of original writers is greatly owing to the unju&s;t e&s;teem in which Imitation is held. Imi|tation is in fact only a decent and allowed pla|giari&s;m. When it appears in a certain degree, it is pronounced literary theft, and ju&s;tly held infamous: in other degrees, and in certain forms and dre&s;&s;es, it is called honourable: but in fact it only differs in the degree of di&s;irepute.</P>
<P>IMITATION I define, &s;uch evident copying from a former author, in whatever language, as evinces that the imitator meaned to appro|priate the merit of the thoughts, language, or other perfections, of his model to him&s;elf. If &s;uch imitation can have any claim to prai&s;e, it mu&s;t ari&s;e from the originality of the copy, if I may u&s;e an expre&s;&s;ion that &s;ounds a little Boeo|tian. When the copy is inferior to the original, neglect is certainly its proper reward: if &s;upe|rior, it merits no prai&s;e, for <HI>facile e&s;t inventis addere,</HI> it is an ca&s;y matter to improve on the inventions of others.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="365">OUR idea of Imitation mu&s;t not however be extended too far; el&s;e we &s;hall pronounce every author, who writes a poem in Twenty-Four Books, an imitator of Homer. It is only imitation of general de&s;ign in its di&s;tinct divi|&s;ions of epi&s;odes, &amp;c. imitation of incidents, of characters, of &s;entiments, images, &s;tyle, man|ner, that is properly Imitation. For in&s;tance,</P>
<P>MILTON writes an epic poem as Homer hath done; for I call Milton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t an epic poem in every &s;en&s;e of the word: critics, who &s;cruple this appellation, &s;eem to forget that <HI>epic</HI> only means <HI>narrative;</HI> and may, with great ju&s;tice, be applied to a Tale of Fontaine, tho generally a&s;cribed to narrative poems of the highe&s;t order, by way of excellence. I &s;ay Milton writes an epic poem as Homer hath done; but wherein doth he imitate Homer? In not one point. The general plan of his poem, his incidents, &amp;c. are totally different from tho&s;e of Homer, or any other writer. Milton is therefore an original poet.</P>
<P>VIRGIL writes an epic poem likewi&s;e as Homer hath done: wherein doth he imitate
<PB N="358" REF="366">Homer? In every thing. He hath nothing of his own: all is &s;tolen; &s;tolen without acknow|legement. It follows, that he is an infamous plagiary.</P>
<P>YET the world hath not dared &s;o to arraign him. The enormity of his crime precluded due puni&s;hment. You know what the pirate &s;aid to &s;ome great conqueror, that the victor, becau&s;e he &s;laughtered whole nations, and plundered whole empires, was called a hero; whereas he, who only killed a few per&s;ons, and rifled a paltry trea&s;ure, was called a thief, So it hath fared with Virgil.</P>
<P>MR. GIBBON &s;omewhere expre&s;&s;es a &s;urprize that no Greek writer whatever, tho many are po&s;terior to Virgil, ever thought him worth mention. The cau&s;e is evident. The Greeks looked upon him as a paltry tran&s;lator; and, what is wor&s;t of all, an epitomizing tran&s;lator, of their own immortal poet. Had a Greek mentioned him, it mu&s;t have been with utter &s;corn, as we would mention any writer who &s;hould publi&s;h in French the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, and the Paradi&s;e Regained, frittered down into
<PB N="359" REF="367">a foppi&s;h production in &s;ix books; and de&s;ire the world to look upon it as an epic poem.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid that an imitation may be origi|nal; and that in this point only the very mi|nute merit of imitation con&s;i&s;ts. Mr. Pope's Imitations of Horace are original and happy. Boileau's poor copies, which he hath had the impudence to call Satires, are con&s;trained and feeble: he has gone behind the ancients like a menial; not like a king, with his attendants before him.</P>
<P>ALL kinds of imitation, and all imitations whatever, &s;ink into that cla&s;s of poetry which we read to ladies at a tea-table; and then give to the &s;ervant, that he may not burn his hands in carrying off the tea-urn. No man of real genius can be an imitator, &s;uppo&s;ing that he made the attempt: originality is coe&s;&s;ential with genius, as Milton tells us that light is coeternal with the deity.</P>
<P>YET with us there is likewi&s;e a god of theft, as Lucian phra&s;es it<NOTE N="*"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>; and we &s;eem to venerate Lucian. in cum qui dixit, Prometheus es in verbis.
<PB N="360" REF="368">imitations as much as originals; goods got by theft, as much as tho&s;e hone&s;tly acquired: nay we be&s;tow upon the thief of &s;ublime inventions the deification only due to the fir&s;t inventor.</P>
<P>WE all know that painters of little or no merit have yet made &s;uch perfect copies of the works of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters, that even, in &s;ome ca&s;es, the&s;e ma&s;ters them&s;elves could not di&s;tingui&s;h them from their own productions. Yet the copiers acquired no reputation from tho&s;e imitations. Why &s;hould it be otherewi&s;e in poetry? Imitations of the very verbage and manner of Chaucer, Spen&s;er, Milton, we &s;ee daily performed by writers of &s;lender talents; and &s;uch imitations I will venture to pronounce the ea&s;ie&s;t of literary labours, and in no re&s;pect more entitled to prai&s;e than copies of paintings.</P>
<P>SPEAKING of imitation in painting, I can|not help adding a remark on the complete folly of in&s;tituting <HI>Academies of Painting,</HI> or any other art, or &s;cience; that is, <HI>Schools of Imita|tion.</HI> Did ever any one good painter ari&s;e from an academy? Never; not even one of the &s;lighte&s;t reputation. The moment the French
<PB N="361" REF="369">academy was in&s;tituted, painting cea&s;ed in that country. No more Claudes or Pou&s;&s;ins aro&s;e. It was re&s;erved for the ideotic coun&s;els of this Gothic reign to cru&s;h all hopes of the progre&s;s of painting at once, by founding an academy. In our academy, as in others, all imitate, none invent: the art is of cour&s;e at a &s;tand, &s;oon to fall, if other means do not fo&s;ter it.</P>
<P>I KNOW of no &s;ervice which our Royal Aca|demy doth, but to &s;poil many good taylors, by converting them into <HI>arti&s;ts,</HI> as they call them|&s;elves. It is to be hoped &s;ome future prince will ju&s;t have &s;en&s;e enough to di&s;&s;olve this lump of regal &s;olly; and to &s;ay to art and &s;ci|ence, "Be free." We already &s;ee its effects in the odd productions of its members. In the hall of the Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manu&s;actures and Commerce, John Street, Adelphi, is now expo&s;ed to public view &s;uch a &s;eries of daubings by a Royal Academician, nay Profe&s;&s;or of Painting to the Royal Academy, as would, both for de&s;ign and execution, have di&s;|graced Lapland in the Twelfth century. Had they appeared on &s;ign po&s;ts, they would only have arraigned the ta&s;te of the innholders; but
<PB N="362" REF="370">as the painter is &s;o impudent as to hold them out as a <HI>national</HI> work, the mo&s;t public con|tempt and cen&s;ure is due to them. What mu&s;t foreigners think of us, upon reading the puffs, and &s;eeing the productions? Po&s;terity! Po&s;te|rity! indeed we are not quite &s;o barbarous as thou wilt take us to be, &s;hould the&s;e <HI>Academical Exerci&s;es</HI> reach thy notice! This arti&s;t, I am in|formed, hath written "A Treati&s;e on Painting," in which he is always quoting many cla&s;&s;ics. God help us! A man mu&s;t bring a cla&s;&s;ic &s;en&s;e to the cla&s;&s;ics, el&s;e their high ideas will con|found, and not enlighten.</P>
<P>TO young writers e&s;pecially, Imitation can|not be held out in too ju&s;t, in too contemptible, a light. They ought even to be told that there is more applau&s;e due to a bad original, than to the be&s;t of copies. By the&s;e means they will at lea&s;s endeavour to be original; and this they cannot accompli&s;h without trying to think for them&s;elves, and to dig diamonds from the mines of invention by their own labour. A point of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to every kind of &s;cience; for, were the clouds, which Imitation and Pre|judice rai&s;e in the mind, di&s;per&s;ed, knowlege of
<PB N="363" REF="371">every denomination would diffu&s;e its benignant light with redoubled rapidity.</P>
<P>TO very young writers, I allow, Imitation is proper as a ta&s;k; but it ought only to be re|garded as &s;uch, and abandoned with other aca|demical occupations. Even this can only be permitted from the con&s;ideration that many minds are like wildings, and will neither bear flowers nor fruit till they are grafted.</P>

<P>SINCE my Letter On Improving the Lan|guage, it has occurred to me, from the hints of &s;ome very learned and ingenious men who much approve of the other ideas, that the final <HI>th,</HI> however &s;oft to an Engli&s;h ear, cannot be pronounced by foreigners at all, and is there|fore by no means laudable. The final <HI>h</HI> had better be always omitted, except in interjec|tions, as Ah! Oh! and its the word <HI>breath,</HI> where it is very expre&s;&s;ive. Sub&s;tantives in <HI>th</HI> &s;hould take the <HI>&eacute;,</HI> omitting the <HI>h;</HI> as trut&eacute;, fait&eacute;, &amp;c. in verbs, &amp;c. both the <HI>t</HI> and <HI>h</HI> ought
<PB N="364" REF="372">commonly to be cut off; or el&s;e altered accord|ing to the genius of the language. By giving plurals in <HI>a,</HI> and a few &s;ub&s;titutions of <HI>z,</HI> perhaps a &s;ufficient number of the letter <HI>s</HI> will be thrown out, and the <HI>pre&s;ent ten&s;e</HI> of verbs may very well retain that letter. Certain it is that were we to give the <HI>th,</HI> and the &s;till wor&s;e <HI>eth,</HI> (<HI>begineth,</HI> &amp;c.) the language would only be rendered more barbarous and horrible, nothing being &s;o feeble and uncouth as that termination <HI>eth.</HI> The <HI>h</HI> is extremely frequent in our tongue, and ought to be omitted whenever it can. Even the final <HI>&s;h</HI> had far better be altered.</P>
<P>I FORGOT to mention that the plural in <HI>a</HI> is perfectly Anglo-Saxon, and homogeneous to our language, there being two declen&s;ions in <HI>a</HI> out of the &s;ix declen&s;ions of &s;ub&s;tantives in the Anglo-Saxon Grammar drawn from Hickes. The in&s;tances are &wyn;iln, <HI>ancilla,</HI> &wyn;ilna, <HI>ancillae;</HI> and &s;unu, <HI>filius,</HI> &s;una, <HI>filii.</HI> So that you &s;ee both male and female &s;ub&s;tantives admitted of it originally; and the neuter may certainly take it with at lea&s;t equal propriety.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLII.</HEAD>
<P>I GRANT you that Mr. Gray's cen&s;ure of David Hume is the mo&s;t exceptionable part of his Letters; but it is very vindicable, being written in confidence to a friend; and with no intention that the public &s;hould &s;ee it. His trite application of the remark, that muddy rivers &s;eem deep, &s;hews that it was written in an un|lucky moment, when thought is ab&s;ent; and perhaps in the flu&s;ter of evening wine: which la&s;t is indeed the only apology that can be made for the remainder of the &s;tricture. No writer can be more clear and manly than Hume; I mean as to his &s;en&s;e; nay, what is wonderful, his &s;tyle is always ea&s;ily intelligible, tho full of &s;oleci&s;ms and every &s;pecies of bar|barity: his gaiety is always that of an inno|cent and truly wi&s;e man. His Hi&s;tory of England, nay his E&s;&s;ays, di&s;play talents very far &s;uperior to any that Gray hath ever &s;hewn. Mr. Hume might have ruled a &s;tate: Gray's utmo&s;t views would only have ruled a college.
<PB N="366" REF="374">Hume's reputation in France was only the echo of his fame in England. Mr. Gray &s;hewed him&s;elf le&s;s than a child when he called Hume one. Such mad calumnies recoil upon their author's judgment, and cru&s;h it to nothing. Yet all this cen&s;ure lights upon the Editor; for Gray would have called upon mountains to cover his &s;hame, if he had &s;een his name pub|licly branded with throwing dirt from Billing&s;|gate upon a cotemporary lord of fame, becau&s;e his envy &s;aw that he was richer dre&s;t, and of far higher rank than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory of Mr. Hume is indeed very far from being laudable. It is a mere apology for prerogative from beginning to end: and, tho the be&s;t apology which. hath been offered, is yet very weak; which &s;hews the cau&s;e mu&s;t be de&s;perate when even &s;o great an advocate utterly fails in its defence. At the &s;ame time that his political principles led him to exalt the prerogative, his philo&s;ophic opinions forced him to depre&s;s the church: while every body knows that <HI>no church, no king.</HI> Hence his work is one chaos of heterogeneous axioms, and mi&s;repre&s;ented events. His opinions even com|bated
<PB N="367" REF="375">his natural &s;en&s;ibility; for I remember that, in narrating &s;ome of the mo&s;t flagitious acts of cruelty of the ble&s;&s;ed reign of Charles I. or II. he di&s;plays due &s;en&s;e of the atrocity of &s;uch calm deeds of tyranny, as make the fren|zies of Nero or Domitian mere je&s;ts: but when he hath got thro them, and his opinion begins to re&s;ume cooler operation, he gravely begins his next paragraph thus: <Q>The&s;e acts of &s;eve|rity (if they can be called &s;uch).</Q></P>
<P>WHAT was the rea&s;on, do you think, that could induce a writer of &s;uch talents to pro&s;ti|tute them &s;o ba&s;ely? that could induce &s;uch a philo&s;opher to &s;uppo&s;e that millions of human beings were to hold their life and happine&s;s at the nod of <HI>one of them:</HI> of a thing called a king; perhaps in corporeal and in mental powers le&s;s than the lea&s;t of his &s;ubjects?</P>
<P>THIS is ea&s;ily accounted for. Hume was poor, and wi&s;hed to be rich. The king is the &s;ure&s;t fountain of wealth: and to flatter him is the path to preferment, and to opulence. Hence public &s;pirit is almo&s;t unknown in monarchies; for one man centers in him&s;elf the wealth and
<PB N="368" REF="376">prai&s;e of his &s;ubjects. Hume tells us him&s;elf, Chap. LX. 1651. <Q>Though the e&s;tabli&s;hed government was but the mere &s;hadow, of a commonwealth, yet was it beginning by proper arts to encourage that public &s;pirit, which no other &s;pecies of civil polity is ever able fully to in&s;pire.</Q> Hear him! Hear him! Then your Hi&s;tory Mr. Hume wi&s;hes to ex|tingui&s;h PUBLIC SPIRIT, that is, to de&s;troy the mo&s;t laudable principle of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I KNOW not how it is that the whole late Scoti&s;h writers of any eminence have been on the tyrannic &s;ide, if we except Dr. Stuart, a man of real abilities, but &s;trangely mi&s;applied in pulling down tho&s;e of others. Yet pre&s;by|tery, the religion of that country, hath always been con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;arily connected with whig principles; and the common people of Scotland are almo&s;t univer&s;ally whigs. The peers are however almo&s;t all tories; owing to the feudal &s;pirit of tyranny and &s;lavery not being wholly extingui&s;hed in that kingdom till 1747, when heretable juri&s;dictions were abo|li&s;hed. The court can only judge of Scotland by the nobility; the fathers of whom having
<PB N="369" REF="377">been tyrants to &s;laves, the &s;ons are willing to be &s;laves to tyrants; for &s;uch is the &s;pirit of the feudal &s;y&s;tem: a later emancipation from which hath thrown Scotland a whole century behind England in point of civil liberty. Now the writers, in general, naturally adapt their principles to tho&s;e of their &s;uperiors, and the court, <HI>unto whom they look for their reward.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE in our times Junius, Wilkes, Churchill, and other men of talents, have judged of that ancient and warlike kingdom very unju&s;tly. A <HI>Scot</HI> is, with them, &s;ynonymous with a <HI>tory,</HI> a <HI>&s;lave.</HI> Nothing can be more oppo&s;ite to the &s;pirit of the nation; however it may apply to the noble <HI>&s;cum</HI> on the <HI>top,</HI> or the <HI>dregs</HI> of mer|cenary writers at the <HI>bottom.</HI> But the nation is full of generous liquor, and hath nothing to do either with its <HI>&s;cum,</HI> or its <HI>dregs;</HI> which are always wor&s;t, when the liquor is be&s;t. Indeed Churchill's works have pa&s;&s;ed thro more edi|tions, and are more read, in Scotland, than here; which &s;hews that the love of that coun|try for liberty is &s;uperior even to the mo&s;t in|veterate national prejudices.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="378">BY a nece&s;&s;ary chain, Scoti&s;h tories and Ja|cobites are now court favorites,
<Q>They ta&s;te the &s;weets of this Saturnian reign.
<BIBL>Epi&s;tle to Sir W. Chambers.</BIBL></Q>
while the real nation, and its real intere&s;ts, are neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed. It is certainly fortunate that Scotland hath not been <HI>free</HI> above forty years, as to that circum&s;tance we are indebted for its happy quiet, at a time when every pro|vince of the Briti&s;h empire evinces, in commo|tion, or in rebellion, the odious and mo&s;t de|plorable, but natural and unavoidable effects of tho&s;e tory principles of government which have prevailed thro this pitiful and mi&s;erable reign, and have made it one blot in the Briti&s;h Annals.</P>
<P>IT is no le&s;s wonderful than true, that, ever &s;ince the name of Whig hath been known, the nation hath been indebted for all its glorious events to men of that de&s;cription; and for its mi&s;eries to the Tories. Indeed, my friend, if any one will &s;hew me that a tory mini&s;try ever did the lea&s;t good to this country, or even did not do it great injury, I &s;hall turn tory in|&s;tantly: but if, from the reign of James I. to this hour, tory mini&s;ters have, by every mea|&s;ure,
<PB N="371" REF="379">brought calamity and di&s;grace on their country, then mu&s;t every Briton view &s;uch principles as the &s;eeds of death in our con&s;titu|tion; and on tho&s;e who profe&s;s them, and fo&s;|ter them in the chief magi&s;trate, as de&s;erving of the execration of every good man, and in fact of the highe&s;t puni&s;hment which the laws of &s;ociety can ordain for tho&s;e who meditate the utter perdition of the community.</P>
<P>A KING of Great Britain who knows that, by the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, he is only elective chief magi&s;trate of the country, and will com|ply with his &s;tation (it is a glorious one!), hath it in his power to appropriate to him&s;elf all the fame ri&s;ing from the public &s;pirit of the greate&s;t of modern nations. But if he wi&s;hes to extend his prerogative, that is, to extingui&s;h that public &s;pirit, he is a <HI>&s;uicide,</HI> and the jury of po&s;terity will bring it in <HI>lunacy.</HI> For he is the enemy of his own power, not to &s;ay of his own exi&s;t|ence: the power of an Engli&s;h king being directly oppo&s;ite to his prerogative; for his power is drawn only from the confidence of the nation, which his prerogative will infal|libly de&s;troy, if di&s;played, and not kept, as a
<PB N="372" REF="380">&s;word in the &s;cabbard, never to be drawn by a brave man but upon mo&s;t urgent occa&s;ion. If he makes him&s;elf little, he will be great indeed! but if he bites the curb, which our fathers have put in his mouth, it is of &s;teel, and he will only &s;poil his teeth. If he wi&s;hes to be an ox, he will feel him&s;elf only the frog in the fable.</P>
<P>YOU will know that I mean &s;till le&s;s to defend the philo&s;ophic tenets of David Hume; tho he be a great and elegant writer of philo|&s;ophy. But I dete&s;t the principles of any man who writes popularly again&s;t the religion of his country, let it be what it will, if it does not injure political freedom, the fir&s;t of human ble&s;&s;ings. I &s;ay popularly, becau&s;e if treated in an high and ab&s;tract, or in a poetical &s;tyle, as Lucretius hath done, it will not injure the vulgar faith, but only afford &s;peculation to the learned. Religion is the only bond of &s;ociety for the mob; and they ought not even to &s;u&s;|pect that their &s;uperiors de&s;pi&s;e it; as they will, in that ca&s;e, from their ignorance of moral theory, imagine that their &s;uperiors have no laws, and con&s;equently that they ought to have none. Philo&s;ophy will never do for the vulgar.
<PB N="373" REF="381">They mu&s;t be bound in the chains of prejudice, and &s;o led thro the road of life; and not tru&s;ted to them&s;elves after proper information.</P>
<P>BESIDES, my friend, the con&s;olations of human life are by no means too numerous. Religion is one of the chief of the&s;e con&s;ola|tions to thou&s;ands of people; and among the&s;e to many po&s;&s;e&s;t of qualities &s;uperior to genius, knowlege, or philo&s;ophy; qualities that con|&s;titute the GOOD, the fir&s;t order of &s;ociety. Shall I, with ra&s;h and &s;acrilegious hand, bur&s;t open the temple of their happine&s;s, and &s;teal away the palladium of their peace? Forbid it Humanity! Forbid it even Philo&s;ophy! The philo&s;ophy that is not benevolent is fal&s;e and de&s;tructive. It is impo&s;&s;ible for man to know the truth: but it is of no importance whether his felicity be founded on truth, or on delu&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>I KNOW not how an opinion hath been propagated among &s;everal relaters of the life of Torquato Ta&s;&s;o, which hath no foun|dation in fact; it is that Ta&s;&s;o's madne&s;s origi|nated from his pre&s;umptuous and di&s;appointed love for Leonora da E&s;te, &s;i&s;ter of Duke Al|fon&s;o of Ferrara. The fact is, his madne&s;s aro&s;e from the various troubles of a dependant and perplexed life, operating with uncea&s;ing violence upon a melancholy temperament, and a morbid tenderne&s;s of feeling. But, before we trace it, let us di&s;cu&s;s this &s;ame tale of Leonora. The materials for this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion &s;hall be drawn from the only authentic life of Ta&s;&s;o, that written by his friend Giovanni Batti&s;ta Man&s;o, lord of Bi&s;accio and Pianca. This long and curious narrative is &s;o extremely rare, that it is no wonder latter biographers only &s;peak of it from report. The edition u&s;ed is that of Venice 1621, 12mo. 372 pages.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="383">MANSO tells that there were three ladies of the name of Leonora at Ferrara; all of whom are celebrated by his friend in different &s;onnets, &amp;c. and that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay which of them &s;tood highe&s;t in his affections, or even if any of them was mi&s;tre&s;s of his heart. The&s;e were the prince&s;s Leonora above-mentioned; Leonora Counte&s;s of San Vitale; and Leonora one of the maids of honour to the prince&s;s. Man&s;o &s;eems to incline to think the latter was the lady really beloved by Ta&s;&s;o; which indeed is &s;o probable, that one may &s;afely pronounce it the truth.</P>
<P>THE beginning of Ta&s;&s;o's madne&s;s, is dated by Man&s;o about the thirty-&s;econd year of his age, two years after publi&s;hing the immortal Geru&s;alemme; when he was tyrannically con|fined by order of Duke Alfon&s;o, on pretence that he wi&s;hed no whim of Ta&s;&s;o &s;hould de|prive his court of &s;o great a character. The violent oppo&s;ition to his great poem, and the contempt which the invidious tried to throw upon it, are put by his biographer as one great cau&s;e of his alienation of mind. The increa&s;e of it he marks as owing to the&s;e cau&s;es:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The
<PB N="376" REF="384">fal&s;ehood of a friend, who publi&s;hed, what was confided to him as an inviolable &s;ecret, the <HI>amori</HI> of Ta&s;&s;o.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The ba&s;e &s;u&s;picions rai&s;ed again&s;t him by his enemies.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. His &s;everal confinements.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The lo&s;s of the Duke his pa|tron's favour.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Let me add, as the &s;tronge&s;t cau&s;e of all, his being &s;o heated at the bad re|ception of the Geru&s;alemme, a reception in all ages given to works &s;urpa&s;&s;ing common expec|tation, as to re-write that Poem under the title of La Geru&s;alemme Conqui&s;tata; nay to com|po&s;e many books of a third alteration to be like a medium between the two former.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Such long compo&s;itions, written with heat and rancour, mu&s;t certainly have impaired the mo&s;t exube|rant brain; and carried off the whole &s;pirits of the mind till lees alone were left.</P>
<P>IT may not be incurious to examine the nature of a &s;hock that could lay &s;o va&s;t a &s;oul in ruins. The enquiry will re&s;emble that of the philo&s;opher who vi&s;its a delicious country de&s;olated by an earthquake. Calabria, the na|tive realm of Ta&s;&s;o, now pre&s;ents too lively an image of his &s;ituation in his latter days: All that is grand, all that is beautiful, mingled in horrible confu&s;ion!</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="385">THE qualities of Ta&s;&s;o's di&s;ea&s;e are de&s;cribed by Man&s;o to have been the&s;e:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. MELANCHOLY. This &s;eems to have been inherited from his father. There is a plea&s;ing melancholy; which is always the con|comitant of genius, and which whoever hath not felt,
<Q>He need not wooe the Mu&s;e: he is her &s;corn.</Q>
But Ta&s;&s;o's melancholy was a torment to him. <Q>I mu&s;t always be an object of your compa&s;|&s;ion,</Q> &s;ays he in a letter to Mauritio Cataneo, <Q>becau&s;e the melancholy which torments me is infinite; and the wor&s;t I could &s;ay of it would exceed all belief, and yet would not be &s;o bad as the truth.</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. DELIRIUM owing to hypocondriac cau&s;es; which increa&s;ed to</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. MADNESS; accompanied with a belief of his being</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. UNDER the influence of witchcraft; and</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. ATTENDED by an apparition.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Such are Man&s;o's divi&s;ions, which cannot be called very proper. On the two la&s;t he gives us &s;ome curious details, which may be worth
<PB N="378" REF="386">taking brief notice of. Ta&s;&s;o &s;peaks thus of his enchantment, and &s;uppo&s;ed &s;piritual attend|ant, <HI>folletto,</HI> in a letter to Mauritio Cataneo: <Q>You mu&s;t know that I was bewitched, and have never been cured; and perhaps have more need of an exorci&s;t than of a phy&s;ician; becau&s;e my di&s;ea&s;e proceeds from magical art. I would likewi&s;e write a few words re&s;pect|ing my daemon: the ra&s;cal hath lately robbed me of many crown pieces; I know not the amount, as I am by no means a mi&s;er in reckoning my money, but I dare &s;ay they amount to twenty. He hath likewi&s;e turned all my books top&s;y-turvy; opened my che&s;ts; robbed me of my keys, which I could not keep from him. I am at all times unhappy, but e&s;pecially in the night. I know not whe|ther my di&s;ea&s;e proceeds from frenzy, or not.</Q> This was written when he was confined at St. Ann's; and, after his deliverance from confine|ment, he &s;till writes thus to the &s;ame Cataneo. <Q>This day, the la&s;t of the year, the brother of the reverend &s;ignior Licino has brought me two of your letters; but one of them was taken from me, as &s;oon as I had read it, and I believe the <HI>folletto</HI> mu&s;t have carried it off,
<PB N="379" REF="387">becau&s;e it is that in which he is mentioned: and this is one of the miracles which I have &s;een often in the ho&s;pital.</Q> (St. Ann's at Fer|rara, where the duke &s;ent him, and appointed &s;kilful phy&s;icians to attend him.) <Q>The&s;e things I am certain are done by &s;ome, magi|cian; and I have many arguments of it; par|ticularly of a loaf vi&s;ibly &s;tolen from me one afternoon, and a plate of fruit taken from before me the other day, when a Poli&s;h gen|tleman,</Q> <HI>(gentil giovane Polacco,)</HI> <Q>came to &s;ee me, worthy indeed to be witne&s;s of &s;uch, a wonder, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>MANSO afterwards tells us that Ta&s;&s;o would frequently in company be quite ab&s;tracted in his frenzy; would talk to him&s;elf, and laugh profu&s;ely; and would fix his eyes keenly upon vacancy for a long time, and then &s;ay that he &s;aw his familiar &s;pirit; and de&s;cribe him as un|der the &s;emblance of an angelic youth, &s;uch as he paints him in his dialogue of <HI>Le Me&s;&s;agiero.</HI> Man&s;o particularly mentions that once Ta&s;&s;o, angry at his incredulity, told him that he &s;hould &s;ee the &s;pirit with his own eyes. Ac|cordingly next day, when they were talking
<PB N="380" REF="388">together, and &s;itting by the fire, Ta&s;&s;o &s;uddenly darted his eyes to a window in the room, and &s;at &s;o intent, that, when Man&s;o &s;poke to him, he returned no &s;ort of an&s;wer. At la&s;t he turned to him, and &s;aid, <Q>Behold the friendly &s;pirit, who is courteou&s;ly come to conver&s;e with me; look at him, and perceive the truth of my words.</Q> Man&s;o immediately threw his eyes toward the &s;pot; but with his keene&s;t vi&s;ion could &s;ee nothing, but the rays of the &s;un &s;hining thro the window into the chamber. While he was thus &s;taring, Ta&s;&s;o had entered into lofty di&s;cour&s;e with the &s;pirit, as he per|ceived from his &s;hare of the dialogue: that of the &s;pirit was not audible to him; but he &s;o|lemnly declares that the di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o grand and marvellous, and contained &s;uch lofty things, expre&s;&s;ed in a mo&s;t unu&s;ual mode, that he re|mained in extacy, and did not dare to open his mouth &s;o much as to tell Ta&s;&s;o that the &s;pirit was not vi&s;ible to him. In &s;ome time the &s;pirit being gone, as Man&s;o could judge, Ta&s;&s;o turned to him with a &s;mile, and &s;aid, he hoped he was now convinced. To which Man&s;o replied, that he had indeed heard wonderful things; but had &s;een nothing. Ta&s;&s;o &s;aid, <Q>Perhaps you have
<PB N="381" REF="389">heard and &s;een more than&mdash;:</Q> he then pau&s;ed; and Man&s;o, &s;eeing him in &s;ilent me|ditation, did not care to perplex him with fur|ther que&s;tions.</P>
<P>THE high things, which Man&s;o heard, doubtle&s;s originated from Ta&s;&s;o's warm attach|ment to the Platonic philo&s;ophy; that &s;ublime ti&s;&s;ue of dreams and vi&s;ions. I would remark, upon the whole &s;ubject of this letter, that it is a woeful proof of the weakne&s;s of the mo&s;t exalted mind, when it lays the rein upon the neck of imagination. A man of genius cannot take too much care to prevent his &s;upernatural fancy from a&s;&s;uming any power over common life. The effect of imagination upon the mind is like that of lime upon a fruit-tree; a little buried at the root, will make it healthy and flouri&s;hing; but too much will totally de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, it may be proper to ob|&s;erve, that the genuine Life of Ta&s;&s;o by Man&s;o was, to the be&s;t of my knowledge, never pub|li&s;hed. This now quoted, which is generally called Man&s;o's Life of Ta&s;&s;o, is in fact only
<PB N="382" REF="390">tran&s;cribed from his; as we may judge from the title, which is, <HI>Vita di Torquato Ta&s;&s;o</HI> &s;critta da <HI>Gio. Batti&s;ta Man&s;o, &amp;c. Al &s;ereni&s;&s;. Sig. Duca d' Urb.</HI> &amp;c. The dedication is &s;igned by the publi&s;her Evangeli&s;to Deuchino; and I know not if he be not the author. The work is however equally valuable as if it had been written by Man&s;o; the author calling him his intimate friend, and being intru&s;ted by him with Ta&s;&s;o's MS. corre&s;pondence. I &s;uppo&s;e Man&s;o's Life was brief; it &s;eems in this work to be tran&s;cribed with great additions.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>ON different late occa&s;ions the &s;ubject of literary forgery hath been mentioned, without any enquiry ever being made into its propriety, or impropriety. Some wi&s;e writers have pronounced it, ridiculou&s;ly enough, to partake of the crime of penal forgery; and have &s;aid that he who will publi&s;h a new pro|duction as ancient would forge an obligation. Others with great ju&s;tice a&s;&s;ert, that nothing can be more innocent; that the fiction of a&s;cribing a piece to antiquity, which in fact doth not belong to it, can in no &s;ort be more improper than the fiction of a poem or novel; that in both the delight of the reader is the only intention.</P>
<P>INDEED tho&s;e innocents who call &s;uch forgery criminal forget that they are bla&s;pheming their &s;aviour and their religion; for the whole para|bles of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which are narrated with circum&s;tances that mo&s;t &s;trongly imply them
<PB N="384" REF="392">to be true, yet are allowed fictitious, fall under this head. Nor is there more fal&s;ehood in Ma|rivaux's telling us that one of his novels was found in pulling down an old partition; in Mr. Walpole's account of his Ca&s;tle of Otranto being a tran&s;lation from an Italian romance; in Macpher&s;on's O&s;&s;ian if you will; than in any of the &s;acred fables, wherein &s;trict truth is &s;acrificed to the plea&s;ure of the hearer.</P>
<P>PERHAPS in fact nothing can be more heroic and generous in literary affairs than a writer's a&s;cribing to antiquity his own production; and thus &s;acrificing his own fame to give higher &s;a|tisfaction to the public. It certainly partakes of that nobility of &s;oul, which is content with its own &s;uffrage; and ranks the author among tho&s;e who
<Q>Do good by &s;tealth, and blu&s;h to find it fame.</Q>
People of &s;hallow under&s;tandings are always the mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious of being made dupes, and are the mo&s;t clamorous when they find they are &s;o: tho&s;e of deeper minds are not deceived by the fiction, as to their judgment; yet their fancy admits the deceit, and receives
<PB N="385" REF="393">higher plea&s;ure from it, than it po&s;&s;ibly could, were no deceit u&s;ed.</P>
<Q><L>Magnanima menzogna, or quando &egrave; il vero</L>
<L>Si bello, che &s;i po&s;&s;a a te preporre?</L></Q>
<P>THERE are however certain kinds, and even certain modes, of literary forgery that may ju&s;tly be held improper; for that is the highe&s;t reproach that can be applied to the wor&s;t kinds of them, none being in the lea&s;t injurious to &s;ociety. Of the improper kind is forgery of hi&s;tories; as tho&s;e of Bero&s;us, and Manetho, by Annius of Viterbo; or works of in&s;truc|tion, as the book of Dominico Flocci <HI>De Ma|gi&s;tratibus Romanis</HI> a&s;cribed to Fene&s;tella; and, in &s;hort, of all the &s;orts of writing in which truth is the object. Poetry and romance are &s;acred to fiction, and it can never be pu&s;hed too far.
<Q><L>Pictoribus atque Poetis</L>
<L>QUIDLIBET AUDENDI &s;emper fuit aequa pote&s;tas.</L></Q>
Yet with one exception as to the mode: for in&s;tance, had Muret, when he forged the ver&s;es a&s;cribed to Afranius &s;o exqui&s;itely, &s;ent them to Jo&s;eph Scaliger, not in common writ|ing,
<PB N="386" REF="394">but tran&s;cribed on vellum, and fumigated with art, &s;o as to appear part of an ancient manu&s;cript, I doubt of its propriety; tho it would have been even in that ca&s;e an impo|&s;ition only worthy of laughter to men of &s;en&s;e; but to weak minds every thing is a crime.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e my letter with an applicable quotation from Mr. Addi&s;on upon this &s;ubject, to be found in No. 542 of the Spectator. 'Some,' ob&s;erves he, <Q>&s;ay an author is guilty of fal&s;ehood, when he talks to the public of manu&s;cripts which he never &s;aw, or de&s;cribes &s;cenes of action, or di&s;cour&s;e, in which he was never engaged. But the&s;e gentlemen would do well to con&s;ider there is not a fable, or parable, which ever was made u&s;e of, that is not liable to this exception; &s;ince no|thing, according to this notion, can be re|lated innocently, which was not once mat|ter of fact.</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLV.</HEAD>
<P>IT would doubtle&s;s be going too far to &s;ay that the Romans had no original writers; and, if you look into my former letters, you will find that I made no &s;uch a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>YET their original authors are very few; and, if you plea&s;e, this letter &s;hall briefly re|capitulate their eminent writers, and di&s;tin|gui&s;h tho&s;e that may ju&s;tly receive the high di&s;tinction of Original. An order nearly chro|nological &s;hall be followed, and they only men|tioned who&s;e works have reached us.</P>
<P>PLAUTUS, a poet too much neglected, his works having infinitely more merit than tho&s;e of Terence, is however not original, except perhaps in one or two plays.</P>
<P>TERENCE need not be mentioned, his plays being mere tran&s;lations. Had only one of tho&s;e been pre&s;erved, his fame would have
<PB N="388" REF="396">&s;tood &s;ix degrees higher, according to the num|ber of his dramas; the perfect &s;imilarity of which evinces that he was po&s;&s;e&s;t of not one &s;peck of genius, even as a tran&s;lator.</P>
<P>LUCRETIUS was not altogether original, there being Greek Philo&s;ophic poems of the &s;ame kind by Empedocles, and others, which are lo&s;t: but, as we know not that he took any thing from them, as his epi&s;odes in par|ticular, and his whole poem in general, breathe a bold &s;pirit of apparent originality, put him down in the middle rank, between Originals and Imitators.</P>
<P>CICERO, nor Cae&s;ar, cannot be called ori|ginal in any view.</P>
<P>SALLUST is an evident imitator of Thucy|dides, and Livy of Herodotus; yet they are both &s;uperior to their originals. Still they are imitators.</P>
<P>VIRGIL is the mo&s;t pitiful imitator of the whole Roman writers, as was &s;hewn on a former occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="397">CATULLUS appears to me not original, the hendeca&s;yllabi, his favorite vehicle, being Gre|cian. Two or three of his pieces are known to be tran&s;lations without acknowlegement; a &s;trong proof again&s;t the re&s;t.</P>
<P>TIBULLUS appears to have the fir&s;t claim to originality of perhaps all the Roman writers. Callimachus and Philetas wrote Elegies; but they were not amatory, nor plaintive. Athe|naeus tells us, that Callimachus wrote an Elegy on a victory: and I learn from no ancient that any one of them was on the &s;ubject of love. His hymns, which have reached us, &s;ay little for his talents. The elegies of Philetas are &s;ometimes quoted by ob&s;cure ancient writers, but from the&s;e quotations we judge that their &s;ubjects were remote from tho&s;e of Tibullus. Upon the whole, I &s;et down this exqui&s;ite poet as original.</P>
<P>PROPERTIUS is not; becau&s;e Tibullus wrote before him. He is very inferior to Tibullus in every re&s;pect; and is in fact a mere pedant in love. I mu&s;t remark on the beginning of the Fir&s;t Elegy of his Third Book,
<PB N="390" REF="398">
<Q><L>Callimachi manes, et Coi &s;acra Philetae,</L>
<L>In ve&s;trum, quae&s;o, me &s;inite ire nemus:</L>
<L>Primus ego ingredior, puro de fonte &s;acerdos,</L>
<L>Itala per Graios orgia ferre choros.</L></Q>
that the reference to Callimachus and Philetas only points at the elegiac &s;tanza u&s;ed by them, not at the &s;ubject: and that we need not won|der at the boa&s;t in the la&s;t couplet, when we reflect that Virgil hath the impudence to &s;ay the &s;ame; tho twenty Latin poets had &s;tolen from the Greeks before he was born.</P>
<P>I DOUBT much if Horace be original in any of his odes, but they are his wor&s;t work, for he is certainly a very middling lyric poet: we mu&s;t e&s;timate him by his chief works, his Satires, and his Epi&s;tles: and in them, e&s;pe|cially in the la&s;t, heavens! what an original, what an exqui&s;ite writer! In the Satires he is happy, in the Epi&s;tles &s;uperlatively &s;o. Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the Pi&s;os, when properly under&s;tood, which we of this age are now happily enabled to do from Mr. Colman's mo&s;t ingenious and acut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tran&s;lation and commentary, is full of as much good &s;en&s;e, and lucid order, as the epi&s;tolar plan can require. By the way let me add, from
<PB N="391" REF="399">Mr. Colman's ju&s;t idea of this epi&s;tle, that the magi&s;terial rule, of not making a drama &s;horter or longer than five acts, &s;eems to be addre&s;&s;ed to him of the younger Pi&s;os who had written a play, and who had probably extended it beyond that number, as Sophocles hath &s;ome|times done. Horace, as an argument to per|&s;uade him to &s;uppre&s;s his piece, which is the intention of his epi&s;tle, fixes it as an ab&s;olute rule, tho indeed from no authority, that no drama &s;hould exceed, or fall &s;hort of, five acts. This rule, would he &s;ay, you have not com|plied with; therefore your piece is unfit for public view.</P>
<P>TO return: from his grand works of the Satires and Epi&s;tles, put Horace as an original writer.</P>
<P>OVID was doubtle&s;s original in his Meta|morpho&s;es, and Fa&s;ti; but his originality is futile, and of no value.</P>
<P>CELSUS hath high merit in every view; and may, I believe, be even entitled to the prai&s;e of originality upon the whole. A cla&s;&s;ic edition
<PB N="392" REF="400">of him is much wanted. The late Dr. Bri&s;bane of Middle&s;ex Ho&s;pital, author of The Anatomy of Painting, had made large MS. collections with this view; which I happened to purcha&s;e of a book&s;eller, and, if you know any man of learning who would u&s;e them with their au|thor's intention, they &s;hould be at his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>TO Phaedrus the merit of being original cannot be denied. As a Fabuli&s;t, he is prefer|able to every writer, not excepting Fontaine him&s;elf. Ter&s;e, polite, facetious, mo&s;t ele|gantly brief, he doth honour even to the age of Augu&s;tus. His language in &s;imple beauty exceeds that of Terence; and the language of Terence is his &s;ole merit; that of Phaedrus is not his merit, but his dre&s;s. The be&s;t fables are I. 1. III. 1.8.9. IV. 19.21.: the 17th of Book IV. is a di&s;grace to his work, as well as &s;ome others. <HI>Ubi plura nitent,</HI> &amp;c. Where is the human work that is perfect?</P>
<P>JUVENAL and Per&s;ius have each an original &s;tyle in their Satires; their thoughts are al&s;o original. It would be mere cavil then to deny their prai&s;e of originality. The fir&s;t is a writer
<PB N="393" REF="401">of amazing moral &s;ublimity. His Satires, I &s;u&s;pect, are &s;uperior to tho&s;e of Horace, if &s;ub|limity be a quality of writing &s;uperior to grace, as, for my own part, I have no doubt but it is. The ob&s;curity of Per&s;ius throws him quite out of the rank of good writers.</P>
<P>LUCAN is original, but it is the originality of Ovid; an originality of no price. His grand and Stoic diction de&s;erves, however, much prai&s;e; and, even con&s;idered as a poet, I agree with Hein&s;ius and Corneille, that he is infinitely &s;u|perior to Virgil.</P>
<P>THE Natural Hi&s;tory of Pliny is an original of va&s;t de&s;ign, and ma&s;terly execution.</P>
<P>QUINTILIAN is the only &s;en&s;ible critic of antiquity, the only one who knew method or di&s;tinction; but he cannot be called original.</P>
<P>STATIUS, Martial, Valerius Flaccus, Silius Italicus, have no claim to originality.</P>
<P>TO Tacitus let us bend the knee as the greate&s;t of the original Roman writers, as the fir&s;t hi&s;torian who wrote with philo&s;ophy for his
<PB N="394" REF="402">guide; as one who&s;e judgment and talents were infinite, and &s;hall never be rivalled. I am not unaware that Milton, in his Familiar Let|ters, calls Salu&s;t the very fir&s;t of all hi&s;torians, and Tacitus his imitator. Tho I revere Milton, I revere the truth more, and think that Salu&s;t imitates Thucydides, and Tacitus imitates none. Salu&s;t deals merely in general reflec|tions; Tacitus in deep and political knowlege.</P>
<P>BOETIUS, the la&s;t Roman writer, has a fair claim to originality, and that not of the meane&s;t kind.</P>
<P>SUCH is the li&s;t of the more eminent Latin writers. Among them we have found only <HI>Eight</HI> Original, namely, TIBULLUS, HORACE, CELSUS, PHAEDRUS, JUVENAL, PLINY the Elder, TACITUS, BOETIUS; and I &s;uppo&s;e, if weighed in the &s;cales of Critical Ju&s;tice, their various powers of genius would rank them in this order.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. TACITUS, as a profound hi&s;torian. None having ari&s;en before, or &s;ince, his genius mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be of wonderful rarity and value.</ITEM>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVI.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;tinction between learning and reading is very ju&s;t. A man may read all the books ever &s;ent into the world, were it po&s;&s;ible, and yet have no title to the appellation of learned. A man of true learning, by the dige&s;tion of a &s;trong mind, converts all literary food into whol&s;ome nouri&s;hment; whereas, when the receptacle is di&s;ordered, or feeble, the more it is crammed the wor&s;e. Such is Mil|ton's idea:
<Q><L>But knowlege is as food, and needs no le&s;s</L>
<L>Her temperance over appetite, to know</L>
<L>In mea&s;ure what the mind may well contain:</L>
<L>Oppre&s;&s;es el&s;e with &s;urfeit; and &s;oons turns</L>
<L>Wi&s;dom to folly, as nouri&s;hment to wind.</L></Q>
For a long time after the revival of learning it was confounded with reading. An author could not call &s;now white, without a long quotation from Ari&s;totle in the margin. This plan having fallen into ju&s;t contempt, we have now adopted the other extreme. Voltaire, an
<PB N="397" REF="405">ape who looks big by getting upon the &s;houl|ders of giants, after dirtying them all over in getting up, writes hi&s;tory without ever quoting his authorities; and tells us anecdotes as an|cient, which are not to be found in any ancient author in print; yet he quotes no MS. Shall we believe him? No. They are the offspring of his own brain. Even for apparent facts he produces no authority; yet hi&s;tory cannot be too well authenticated. As he made his poetry hi&s;tory, &s;o he hath made his hi&s;tory poetry; he is an hi&s;torical poet, and a poetical hi&s;torian. This is an in&s;tance that there are works in which it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew one's learning by quotations, and not by the e&s;&s;ence of the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>FOR a man's writing on learned &s;ubjects with no di&s;play of erudition, we can only account by pronouncing him ignorant. The more a man hath read upon any &s;ubject, he will doubtle&s;s write the better; &s;uppo&s;ing him a man of any capacity. Is not a rich man bet|ter qualified to furni&s;h a banquet that will delight every palate, than one who&s;e poverty fru&s;trates his intention?</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="406">NONE I confe&s;s are &s;o fond of &s;hewing their learning as tho&s;e who have little of it. Par&s;on Adams, you remember, when &s;hewing his half guinea, all he had, &s;ays he doth it not from o&s;tentation of riches. Have you never heard a man quote Horace in company, and then, with many apologies for being a man of learning, tran&s;late the pa&s;&s;age in &s;uch a manner as to evince that he had not even the rudiments of erudition? Swift hath well ob&s;erved that what a man wants in &s;en&s;e is &s;upplied in vanity. The ob&s;ervation is equally ju&s;t when applied to learning; for &s;ound learning may be defined to be an appropriation of the &s;en&s;e of others.</P>
<P>SUETONIUS, in his books <HI>De Illu&s;tribus Gram|maticis,</HI> tells us that Cornelius Nepos to whom the work of Victor <HI>De viris Illu&s;tribus,</HI> read in &s;chools in &s;pite of its bad Latin, is a&s;cribed, wrote a treati&s;e <HI>De di&s;crimine literati et eruditi.</HI> And one Poiret hath written a book <HI>De erudi|tione &s;olida et fal&s;a.</HI> I have not read it, but the title is a good one. Solid &s;cience I think may be defined, That which is u&s;eful to man, either individually or &s;ocially. This definition in|cludes elegant learning, for what plea&s;es a man
<PB N="399" REF="407">is highly u&s;eful to him. The di&s;pute whether poetry, for in&s;tance, is meant to be u&s;eful or plea&s;ing, is idle. What is plea&s;ing is u&s;eful. Poetry is only u&s;eful by amu&s;ing. The time is pa&s;t when it pre&s;erved laws, and gave &s;ocial manners to &s;avage nations. The harp of Orpheus &s;ounds no more. This unexpected metaphor brings to my mind a droll anecdote, told by Lucian, in his treati&s;e <HI>Again&s;t an igno|rant man who bought a number of books,</HI> which I &s;hall beg leave to lay before you, as a lively picture of the futility of any &s;cience when canva&s;&s;ed by inadequate powers of mind.</P>
<P>WHEN the Thracian Bacchanals tore Or|pheus to pieces, they &s;ay that his harp was thrown into the river Hebrus with his bleed|ing head upon it. While the head &s;ung a lamentable elegy on the fate of its late proprie|tor, the harp, touched by the wind, accompa|nied it with a &s;olemn &s;train, till &s;wimming down the Egean &s;ea the mournful concert ar|rived at Le&s;bos. The Le&s;bians, taking them up, buried the head in the &s;pot where, in Lu|cian's time, &s;tood the temple of Bacchus; and hung up the lyre in the Temple of Apollo.
<PB N="400" REF="408">Neanthus, the &s;on of Pittacus the tyrant, who had heard the wonderful qualities of this harp, that it tamed wild bea&s;ts, and moved even trees and rocks, and that, &s;ince the time of Orpheus, it had never been touched, had a vio|lent de&s;ire to try its effects. With this view he bribed the prie&s;t, who had it in keeping, to give it to him, and hang up one quite &s;imilar in its place. Neanthus wifely thought it was not proper to u&s;e it by day, nor in the city, le&s;t he &s;hould bring the hou&s;es about his ears, but, hiding it under his robe, went by night to try it in the environs. Being quite ignorant of mu&s;ic, he began &s;craping upon it at a &s;trange rate, but with no &s;mall pride and &s;atisfaction, as deeming him&s;elf the worthy heir of the mu&s;ic of Orpheus. The town dogs who, I &s;uppo&s;e, were all turned loo&s;e into the &s;treets at night, as is now the cu&s;tom in Turkey, came to the &s;ound in crouds. Neanthus in tran&s;port imagined, now the bea&s;ts had come, the other effects would follow, and looked &s;harp around to &s;ee if a rock and a tree were coming toward him dancing a minuet. Poor man! he was wofully deceived! The dogs had only come, thinking the &s;trange noi&s;e pro|ceeded
<PB N="401" REF="409">from a wolf, or a wild hog; and en|raged by the horrid din tore its unfortunate author to pieces.</P>
<P>TO return, for I am wandering like Mon|taigne, tho with a ju&s;ter title to wander; there is no doubt but elegant literature forms a great branch of true learning, being in fact nearly as u&s;eful to man as the mo&s;t &s;olid parts of it; for poetry may be regarded as of almo&s;t equal uti|lity with philo&s;ophy. The one amu&s;es life, and diverts care by that &s;weet pliability of man's &s;pirit which Sterne &s;peaks of; the other in|&s;tructs us to le&s;&s;en our care. The effect is almo&s;t the &s;ame.</P>
<P>USEFUL learning may often be di&s;tingui&s;hed from fal&s;e by the congenial delight, which the fir&s;t affords to the human mind. Nature hath exqui&s;itely contrived that the true plea&s;ure and the intere&s;t of man &s;hould walk hand in hand, as &s;he covers the fruit with the flower. To this purpo&s;e I mu&s;t again beg leave to quote Lucian, for an ob&s;ervation as exten&s;ive as it is beautiful. In his excellent work, On writing hi&s;tory, he tells us that&mdash;In the propriety of
<PB N="402" REF="410">any thing lies its greate&s;t beauty. He is &s;peak|ing of fal&s;e ornaments: but take his own words, for they &s;hould be written with letters of gold in the temple of Critici&s;m. <GAP DESC="foreign">. This &s;entiment may likewi&s;e be applied to plea&s;ure, and utility. Nature having &s;eldom &s;eparated them; and having in particular &s;prinkled the paths of fal&s;e &s;cience with thorns, and tho&s;e of the true with ro&s;es.</P>
<P>THE inveterate antipathy of ignorance to &s;cience, and of tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;t of fal&s;e learning to tho&s;e inheriting the true, is well known; and is ea&s;ily accounted for by the analogical aver|&s;ion of owls, bats, and other nocturnal mon|&s;ters, to the light of the &s;un. You cannot ima|gine how ea&s;y it is for a blockhead to &s;neer at erudition. It is &s;ometimes very diverting to &s;ee ingenious and profound arguments, detailed by a man of learning upon any point turned again&s;t him, in high triumph, by dunces, who could never have thought of tho&s;e arguments had not they been digged from the mines o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;cience with great labour, and pre&s;ented to them forged into Weapons.</P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="411">TRUE &s;cience we have defined to be that which is u&s;eful to man; it follows, that fal&s;e &s;cience is that which is u&s;ele&s;s to him.

<HEAD>LETTER XLVII.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I lately gave you my thoughts upon the Advancement of Learning &s;ince the time of Lord Bacon, I believe I did not &s;peak of Moral Philo&s;ophy and Social Sci|ence, at &s;o great length, as the va&s;t importance of tho&s;e, the grande&s;t parts of knowlege, would require. The rea&s;on was that my Letter had, before I came to the&s;e points, exceeded all bounds; and I was willing to make all the ha&s;te to a conclu&s;ion, which I decently could. But as I look upon the&s;e two articles as form|ing the very e&s;&s;ence of human wi&s;dom; and to be of them&s;elves more weighty than all its other branches put together, I now reque&s;t your permi&s;&s;ion to pre&s;ent you with a few thoughts upon them; expecting, as u&s;ual, to be favoured with yours in return, that by the colli&s;ion of our thoughts, in this other &s;pecies of conver&s;ation, the flame of truth may be &s;truck out.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="413">MORAL Philo&s;ophy con&s;iders man as an individual principally: but as his tran&s;actions, as an individual, are, of nece&s;&s;ity, blended with tho&s;e of other individuals, Social Science mingles with Moral Philo&s;ophy by impercep|tible &s;hades.

<P>HOW &s;urprizing is it, my friend, what a mortifying in&s;tance of the blindne&s;s of man to his prime intere&s;t, that, while other arts are &s;o diligently explored by many penetrating minds, this tran&s;cendent art, the &s;overeign of all arts, THE ART OF LIFE, &s;hould be almo&s;t, with propriety, to be regarded as an undi&s;covered continent in the globe of &s;cience!

<P>LORD BACON well ob&s;erves that <Q>Life con|&s;i&s;ts not in novelties or &s;ubtleties.</Q> It is in|deed a trite ob&s;ervation, that when a man hath &s;een one family he hath &s;een the world. It follows that THE ART OF LIFE may with the
<PB N="406" REF="414">greate&s;t propriety be defined, and reduced to a &s;cience.</P>
<P>TO do this with ea&s;e the middling rank, the happie&s;t and be&s;t of all, cannot be de&s;cribed with too minute a detail. This may be con|&s;idered as the &s;ubject of the concerto, to u&s;e a mu&s;ical metaphor; remarks and examples from the extremes of life may, to pur&s;ue the figure, be regarded as airs.</P>
<P>THE ART OF LIFE can never be examined with too &s;crupulous a minutene&s;s. Every trifle is important to man, him&s;elf a trifle, and his life a trifle. You cannot therefore expect that this Letter &s;hould enter into any detail: it can only ju&s;t hint at the chief divi&s;ions; each of which de&s;erves the acute inve&s;tigation of a dif|ferent author. An author too out of the com|mon run of authors; an author who is a man of the world.</P>

<P>SUCH I imagine ought to be the general idea of this GRAND ART. Some of its branches have been already cultivated, but by no means with &s;ufficient care. Charron and Nettleton are perhaps the mo&s;t important authors, who&s;e works in this way de&s;erve any mention. The
<PB N="408" REF="416">fir&s;t of the&s;e in particular is a very valuable writer; but neither of them come up to the idea propo&s;ed. The grand rea&s;on why the practical happine&s;s of man is &s;o de&s;ert a field of ob&s;ervation is, that he he hath never yet di&s;covered that important things, as theories of worlds, &amp;c. are trifles to him; and trifling things, as dome&s;tic plea&s;ures, &amp;c. are to him matters of the la&s;t importance. The happine&s;s of man is compounded of a variety of minute particles of wi&s;dom and plea&s;ure: it is an ex|qui&s;ite concert produced by a variety of in&s;tru|ments; mo&s;t of them very minute in them|&s;elves, yet of great effect upon the whole. Now no writer hath thought of laying down the art of tuning the&s;e &s;everal in&s;truments. No: that were beneath the dignity of philo&s;o|phy! It is judged enough to lay down rules for the concert, without enquiring whether the in&s;truments are in proper tune, or not. Hence, to drop the metaphor, the general titles of books on this &s;ubject, On Virtue and Happi|ne&s;s, On Wi&s;dom. The writers did not know that their very titles were pre&s;umptuous to madne&s;s; and that one hundredth part of their plan was far beyond the cultivation of any one
<PB N="409" REF="417">author. This affectation of being important de&s;troys the merit of all writers on this &s;ubject. They did not know that they would have been infinitely more important had they been le&s;s &s;o. The &s;aying of Parmenio to Philotas, <Q>My &s;on make thy&s;elf le&s;s,</Q> may with great truth be applied to all practical writers on human wi&s;|dom; with this implied addition, <Q>that thou maye&s;t be greater.</Q> Man! Proud Man! Mu&s;t thy pride be for ever the de&s;truction of thy real knowlege, and of thy happine&s;s?</P>
<P>I HAVE dwelt &s;o long upon this preliminary part, becau&s;e it forms the very ba&s;is and foun|dation of the ART now &s;poken of. Till au|thors can be per&s;uaded to drop generalities, and minutely examine particulars; not upon theo|retical, but upon experimental principles, it is in vain to expect any progre&s;s in this great &s;cience.</P>
<P>MAN'S happine&s;s, which is the only final purpo&s;e of this ART, hath been already ob|&s;erved to be an aggregate compo&s;ed of many minute parts. Perhaps nothing contributes more to it than the knowlege of economy,
<PB N="410" REF="418">yet not one book has ever been written upon this point, tho nothing is more capable of being illu&s;trated by details and examples.</P>
<P>THIS may &s;erve as an explanation of my meaning when recommending THE ART OF LIFE to be treated by philo&s;ophers at length, in its minute heads, not taken in gro&s;s. I &s;peak of examples, becau&s;e it is a trite ob&s;ervation, that example goes further than precept: and becau&s;e, without examples, the &s;everal divi&s;ions of this knowlege will be more dry, and far le&s;s in&s;tructive.</P>
<P>THESE examples ought always, if po&s;&s;ible, to be be taken from real life; or to bear as &s;trict a re&s;emblance of it as po&s;&s;ible: at any rate they ought to be related in the &s;imple&s;t manner. Indeed the whole works, upon any branch of this &s;cience, ought to be written in the mo&s;t &s;imple &s;tyle imaginable; being intended for the in&s;truction of all ranks of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>ANY further remarks on this head I &s;hall not venture upon. I cannot however omit ob&s;erving that, in all well regulated govern|ments, a DOMESTIC TRIBUNAL &s;hould be in|&s;tituted,
<PB N="411" REF="419">compo&s;ed of re&s;pectable fathers of fa|milies; who &s;hould have power to regulate in a mild manner all &s;erious di&s;putes between fa|ther and &s;on, or the like. The va&s;t power that parents have over the happine&s;s of their chil|dren, gives many depraved parents an unli|mited tyranny, and the wor&s;t &s;pecies of it; for this always attacks the very vitals of dome&s;tic life, whereas tyrannic government &s;eldom or never goes &s;o far. Many parents make their children u&s;ele&s;s and mi&s;erable for life, and di&s;|inherit them in the end, for no cau&s;e but their own diabolical caprice. If children are di&s;o|bedient, the parents can always puni&s;h them; but if parents are tyrannical, there is no redre&s;s for their unfortunate offspring. The want of &s;uch a tribunal is a di&s;grace to the legal pru|dence of every modern country; for I think &s;omething like it actually exi&s;ted in one or two of the &s;tates of antiquity.</P>
<P>I MUST not conclude without remarking further that Lord Bacon's own hints, upon civil &s;ociety and bu&s;ine&s;s, are very valuable, as every &s;ketch of &s;uch a ma&s;ter is: they may be regarded with ju&s;tice as forming a model of a &s;eries of documents upon this &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII.</HEAD>
<P>NOBODY will deny that in &s;ome few pa&s;&s;ages of the Geru&s;alemme Liberata, and tho&s;e very minute, Ta&s;&s;o hath admitted a &s;tyle a little too figurative. Yet it may with great ju&s;tice be a&s;&s;erted that there are more blemi&s;hes in the Iliad, than in the Geru&s;a|lemme; and I que&s;tion not but there are even very near as many in&s;tances of exce&s;&s;ive figure, and fal&s;e decoration, or in &s;hort what our cri|tics call tin&s;el. But if Ta&s;&s;o &s;hould be found to exceed Homer in this, which I very much doubt, he hath many excu&s;es which Homer had not: &s;uch as the Platonic, or metaphy&s;ical, &s;tyle, introduced into Italian poetry by Pe|trach; Ta&s;&s;o's own fondne&s;s for Platoni&s;m; and the very &s;pirit of refinement which per|vades Italian minds, Italian thoughts, and Italian language.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="421">THERE is no human work, however perfect upon the whole, that can be pronounced to be faultle&s;s. Nay a faultle&s;s work is commonly an in&s;ipid one; that is, hath the greate&s;t of faults; is all one fault, without particular faults. Where a writer ri&s;es to uncommon excellence, his mind, feeble from the lofty flight, will be apt to &s;ink beneath even its com|mon level. This remark is as old as the time of Longinus, who well marks the va&s;t prefer|ence to be given to an author, who, with great faults, hath great beauties, over him who, hath neither fault nor beauty. I do not however mean to apply it to Ta&s;&s;o, who&s;e faults are &s;carce and minute; and his excellencies great and numerous.</P>
<P>IN e&s;timating the defects of a valuable au|thor, we &s;hould make our&s;elves his cotempo|raries. If Homer de&s;erves pardon for the &s;im|plicity of the manners he paints, becau&s;e in his time manners were quite of primitive &s;impli|city; doth not Ta&s;&s;o, in like manner, de&s;erve favour for his &s;tyle being now and then too figurative, while we all know that the Italian &s;tyle of his age was figurative to exce&s;s? Do
<PB N="414" REF="422">not we pardon to Shak&s;pere his quibbles, and to Milton his religion? Let us only make half the allowance for Ta&s;&s;o, who&s;e faults are not &s;o numerous, nor his merits of &s;o high a rank; and it is enough.</P>
<P>THE worth of the Geru&s;alemme I may per|haps be led to e&s;timate on a future occa&s;ion. The &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent Letter &s;hall be an equitable enumeration of what are called the <HI>conceits</HI> to be found in it. I have ju&s;t fini&s;hed a peru&s;al of it, made with a view to mark every one that aro&s;e; and I doubt not but I have done it with a &s;evere eye. You &s;hall have my li&s;t, which I believe will be found neither incurious nor unu&s;eful, after I have ob&s;erved that in Eleven of the Twenty Books of the Geru&s;alemme, there is not the &s;malle&s;t &s;hadow of too figurative a &s;tyle. The&s;e Eleven Books are the I. III. V. VI. VIII. IX. XI. XIII. XIV. XV. XVII. The pa&s;&s;ages that are &s;u&s;picious in the other books are as follow.</P>

His compo&s;ition taken on the whole is mo&s;t maje&s;tically grave; and of it&s;elf &s;ufficiently arraigns its accu&s;ers of calumny and fal&s;ehood.

<HEAD>LETTER XLIX.</HEAD>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of our corre&s;pondence, I believe more than one occa&s;ion hath ari&s;en of plac|ing the critical abilities of Mr. Addi&s;on in no high e&s;timation. But as perhaps &s;tronger proofs may be required in the mo&s;t innocent attack upon the &s;lighte&s;t talents of a writer &s;o de|&s;ervedly eminent, I &s;hall, if you plea&s;e, in this Letter produce the&s;e &s;tronger proofs. There is another rea&s;on which induces me to this di&s;a|greeable ta&s;k, and it is, that the mo&s;t minute failings of &s;uch an author de&s;erve animadver|&s;ion, for the rocks that have injured a ve&s;&s;el of &s;uch &s;upreme rate, would doubtle&s;s, if not avoided with caution, prove of immediate fata|lity to critical adventurers of &s;mall &s;ize.</P>
<P>THE only writings of Mr. Addi&s;on, worthy to be con&s;idered as pieces of critici&s;m, occur in the Spectator. This view of his critical errors &s;hall therefore be re&s;tricted to that work, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> taken in the order in which they ari&s;e. I
<PB N="421" REF="429">might be made ten times as long; but I hurry thro it, being &s;en&s;ible that the ta&s;k is invidious, and feeling it di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>SPECT. No. 5. Addi&s;on hath given more proofs than one of his very &s;light acquaintance with the Italian language. Armida is, in the opera of Rinaldo, called an Amazonian enchantre&s;s, or more properly an enchanting Amazon, (taking <HI>enchanting</HI> in rather an uncommon acceptation) not from her being of the nation of the Ama|zons, as Addi&s;on &s;trangely mi&s;under&s;tands it; but from her being an enchantre&s;s and <HI>virago.</HI> The remark on the Chri&s;tian Magician is equally ab&s;urd. The Magician doth not deal with the devil, as Addi&s;on mi&s;repre&s;ents it much in the &s;pirit of an old woman, but with angels, the daemons of Platoni&s;m; who were thought the &s;ervants of good men, and none but the good. Before &s;uch critici&s;ms no work can &s;tand. The critic totally mi&s;repre&s;ents the meaning, and then writes critici&s;ms upon his own mi&s;repre&s;entations. The noted attack on Ta&s;&s;o, which follows the&s;e odd blunders, is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in pity and &s;ilent contempt. Ta&s;&s;o is innocent of the charge, and mu&s;t be honour|ably
<PB N="422" REF="430">acquitted. The Engli&s;h of Mr. Addi&s;on's violent hatred of the opera is, that he wrote for the Engli&s;h theatre, and was mortified to &s;ee it neglected for the Italian.</P>
<P>No. 18. Phaedra and Hippolitus is &s;o woful a tragedy, that I know no Italian opera that would not prove a far higher entertainment.</P>
<P>No. 39. A perfect tragedy, the noble&s;t pro|duction of human nature! Where is epic po|etry? but Addi&s;on was writing Cato; and his rules of critici&s;m are always for his own ad|vantage.</P>
<P>HIS prai&s;e of Lee on this occa&s;ion, and of Blackmore on another, proves &s;ufficiently the depth of his critical abilities.</P>
<P>No. 40. The tragicomedy is the mo&s;t natural, and, of con&s;equence, the mo&s;t proper, &s;tyle of the drama. Very little learning is required to know that it is not the product of the Engli&s;h &s;tage, but of every &s;tage, ancient and modern; except the French, which is &s;acred to Sleep.</P>
<P>No. 44. Ore&s;tes's plea for not killing the U&s;urper in&s;tantly I believe &s;trikes every reader as futile, and a mere ancient &s;tage-trick.</P>
<P><PB N="423" REF="431">No. 62. The prai&s;e of Bouhours by Addi&s;on and Che&s;terfield will never re&s;cue him from the contempt of every man who hath read or thought much. Good &s;tomachs cannot be &s;a|tisfied with &s;yllabubs. The critique on Gothic architecture &s;hews the pitiful <HI>gout de comparai|&s;on.</HI> Addi&s;on did not know that every Art ad|mits of infinite modes of beauty; and that to confine it to one of the&s;e modes is the rever&s;e of an attempt to enlarge human knowlege and enjoyment.</P>
<P>No. 160. This e&s;&s;ay on Genius cannot be read without laughter, and a certain a&s;&s;urance that the author knew not what it was.</P>
<P>No. 267. What critic ever heard of an <HI>heroic</HI> poem? Why examine a poem upon principles utterly inanalagous to it?</P>
<P>I REMEMBER not that Ari&s;totle allows that Homer's fable wants unity. If he doth, he is a poor critic; if he doth not, Addi&s;on is a poorer.</P>
<P>THE perpetual quotations of Ari&s;totle give di&s;gu&s;t. Why doth he never quote Nature?</P>
<P><PB N="424" REF="432">No. 273. A Greek's regard for Achilles mu&s;t have been very &s;mall; like the regard of a Spaniard for a Portugue&s;e.</P>
<P>No. 285. That the names of figures of &s;peech were invented to palliate <HI>defects</HI> of &s;peech, is perhaps the only new critical remark Addi&s;on hath ever made; and it is unhappily quite void of foundation. Mr. Addi&s;on forgot that gram|mar was invented for &s;peech, not &s;peech for grammar.</P>
<P>No. 297. There is no occa&s;ion in Nature for an epic poem always ending happily. If &s;uch a rule exi&s;ted in the fooli&s;h axioms of critici&s;m, Milton knew to de&s;pi&s;e it. Addi&s;on &s;hould have drawn new rules from Milton, and not have pretended to judge him by foreign laws, as he doth all along.</P>

<P>No. 339. The <HI>golden compa&s;&s;es</HI> ought to have been reprobated. All metaphors applied from Art to Nature are the very rever&s;e of &s;ublime.</P>
<P>No. 305. <Q>The fir&s;t original of the drama was a religious wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ting only of a Chorus, which was nothing el&s;e, but an hymn to a deity.</Q> There are rather more errors in this &s;entence than words, as I believe you will judge from former Letters. The deity was Bacchus, yet we are told in the next &s;en|tence of <HI>innocence and religion.</HI> Was Mr. Addi|&s;on &s;o very entire a &s;tranger to Greek &s;cience as not to know that the wor&s;hip of Bacchus was utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with innocence and religion?</P>
<P>No. 412. We are now arrived at the greate&s;t critical effort of Addi&s;on; that on the plea&s;ures of imagination. One of the three cau&s;es which, he lays down as productive of the&s;e plea&s;ures is of no foundation. Novelty never plea&s;es, ex|cept when accompanied with the other cau&s;es Grandeur or Beauty. The fir&s;t &s;ight of an ugly object only makes it more di&s;gu&s;ting than when
<PB N="426" REF="434">u&s;e hath in &s;ome mea&s;ure reconciled us to it. Dr. Aken&s;ide, you will ob&s;erve from a com|munication I made to you &s;ome time ago, had &s;truck it out of his Poem, very ju&s;tly, upon more mature con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>IT is not novelty, but beauty, that makes natural objects more plea&s;ing in the &s;pring. Be&s;ide, they are new to no man. Mr. Addi&s;on &s;urely did not mean his critici&s;ms for tho&s;e who had never &s;een the beauties of Spring before.</P>
<P>No. 413. Mr. Addi&s;on is the fir&s;t writer who di&s;covered that <HI>final cau&s;es lie bare to our ob&s;er|vation.</HI> Bacon would have &s;aid that final cau&s;es are utterly unknown to man. Such is the difference between deep and &s;uperficial &s;cience. Ignorance is always ra&s;h. Knowlege doubts and trembles.</P>
<P>No. 415. <Q>For every thing that is maje&s;tic imprints an awfulne&s;s and reverence on the mind of the beholder, and &s;trikes in with the natural greatne&s;s of the &s;oul.</Q> Bravi&s;&s;imo! Chee&s;e is chee&s;e! This is a lively in&s;tance of what they call critici&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="435">I QUESTION if it was Phidias who propo&s;ed to cut Mount Athos into a &s;tatue of Alexander. But I beg pardon for &s;uch a remark, for nothing is more pardonable than a &s;lip of this kind. Indeed they who remember names and dates &s;eldom remember any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>No. 420. Mr. Addi&s;on tells us of the mo&s;t agreeable talents of an hi&s;torian; and &s;eems to think they con&s;i&s;t in entertaining his reader. If &s;o, fabulous hi&s;torians are be&s;t. The mo&s;t <HI>agreeable</HI> talent of an hi&s;torian is to <HI>in&s;truct.</HI> This is done by di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of human actions, and of the characters who were their agents.</P>
<P>SUCH are the brief remarks which at pre&s;ent occur to me upon the critical errors of Addi&s;on. Volumes might have been written to refute &s;everal of them; but I know that to you they need only be hinted. Be&s;ides I was quite im|patient to get rid of this ungrateful ta&s;k; for Addi&s;on is one of my mo&s;t favorite writers, and nothing but my &s;acred love of critical equity could have been an inducement to its execution.</P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="436">THE be&s;t writers are perhaps the mo&s;t liable to faults of a certain kind, in like manner as fertile ground is, where no grain is &s;own, fertile of weeds. Strong weeds &s;peak a rich &s;oil, nearly as much as &s;trong corn; yet they ought to be rooted up that they may not injure the harve&s;t.</P>

<P>ONE day I went home with a mind filled with chagrin. After having, in my heart, &s;a|tirized all conditions of men, and even my&s;elf, I fell into a profound &s;leep, and had a dream. I imagined my&s;elf tran&s;ported to a &s;olitude, re|mote from the vices and follies of mankind. I walked with tranquil joy in a large fore&s;t, which I thought protected my cottage from the violent winds of Arabia; and forgot in its &s;hades the caprices of life.</P>
<P>THE &s;un aro&s;e. His rays gilded the verdure over my head with feeble tran&s;parency. I heard
<PB N="436" REF="444">the &s;ongs of a multitude of birds. I was atten|tive to all their accents. I ob&s;erved the diver&s;ity of their forms; of their plumage; of their flight.</P>
<P>HEAVEN lent me of a &s;udden the power of under&s;tanding their &s;everal dialects. The eagle railed at the owl on her weakne&s;s of &s;ight: the turtle dove &s;poke very ill of the hawk, who expre&s;&s;ed contempt for his weakne&s;s: the black|bird was very joco&s;e on the cry of the eagle: the jay and the magpie mocked each other; they reproached the crow with his melancholy appearance; and &s;aid that the &s;parrow had a vulgar look.</P>
<P>THERE &s;uddenly de&s;cended from heaven a mo&s;t extraordinary apparition. It was a youth who&s;e colour re&s;embled ro&s;es &s;prinkled over pure &s;now by &s;ome playful virgin of Circa&s;&s;ia. His wings were of the mo&s;t delicate azure, and their edges &s;treaked with gold, as the beams of the morning &s;treak the &s;ummer &s;ky. His locks were black as ebony. His eyes were blacker than ebony. No hypocrite could bear their piercing radiance, which went to the bottom of the &s;oul. He alighted on a lofty plane-tree,
<PB N="437" REF="445">who&s;e height &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the cedars of the fore&s;t. He called the different birds by their names. They obeyed, and flocked around him, perch|ing on the branches of the &s;urrounding cedars. They trembled in &s;ilence. He &s;poke.</P>
<P>HEAR what I reveal to you by command of the Mo&s;t High. Ye are all equal in merit in his &s;ight. Ye only differ in qualities, becau&s;e ye are de&s;tined to different functions.</P>
<P>THOU, the eagle, art born for war: thy cry, expre&s;&s;ive of force, cannot have harmony. The owl could not have caught reptiles and in&s;ects, of which &s;he was made to clear the earth, if her eyes, of minute and nocturnal vi&s;ion, could have met the blaze of the meridian &s;un. The nightingale and linnet, it is true, are of delicate con&s;titution; but how el&s;e could they po&s;&s;e&s;s delicacy of &s;ong? The turtle is made for love; the hawk for rapine. Remain in your re&s;pective conditions without regret, and without pride. There are differences in your kinds, but there are no faults.</P>
<P>AT the&s;e words I &s;aw the birds di&s;per&s;e thro the fore&s;t; and the genius flew to heaven dart|ing at me a look that &s;poke.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="446">I WAKED and &s;aid: &s;hall I then expect from the cadi the mildne&s;s of the courtier? From the iman the freedom of the warrior?

<P>THE old &s;hepherd ran to the &s;pot from whence the voice aro&s;e. He beheld, at the foot of a rock, a young man half-reclined upon the &s;and. His clothes were torn.

He &s;aw upon the gra&s;t Shel-Adar, who held the hand of an old man, who&s;e countenance expre&s;&s;ed wi&s;dom and gaiety, The old &s;hepherd &s;aw them, and &s;topped to en|joy all the plea&s;ure which the &s;ight of the hap|pine&s;s of his brethren in age could afford. The old men had a number of youths about them; among whom were two children, who &s;ome|times played on the gra&s;s, and then would come to care&s;s the two fathers. They were
<PB N="447" REF="457">well-clad; they had all the health, vivacity, and gaiety of their age. The good &s;hepherd ea&s;ily under&s;tood that the&s;e children were the brothers of the young hu&s;band of Fatm&eacute;; and that the old man, who held Shel-Adar by the hand, was their father.</P>
<P>NIGHER to the good &s;hepherd, by the &s;hade of the grove, Fatm&eacute; and her hu&s;band &s;at on the gra&s;s. In motionle&s;s rapture they often looked upon each other with inten&s;e eagerne&s;s. They &s;miled &s;o &s;weetly that it &s;eemed that plea&s;ure alone had ever printed its ve&s;tige on their faces. Often the young couple interrupted their delicious &s;ilence by lively, but mode&s;t, care&s;&s;es. One might &s;ee that they were re|&s;trained by the pre&s;ence of their fathers. Often they looked around them; and appeared intoxi|cated with the felicity of all that was dear to them, more than even with their own. Their joy, which in&s;pired all the company, manife&s;ted it&s;elf equally in all their faces; as the &s;ame &s;ap produces like flowers on all the branches of the orange-tree.</P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="458">THE good &s;hepherd looked on each of them by turns. He then chanced to turn his eyes toward the neighbouring meadows. He beheld the flocks which he had given to Shel-Adar. They &s;urpa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e of Shel-Adar, among which they were mingled, and were di&s;tin|gui&s;hable by their &s;uperior whitene&s;s and beau|ty.

<HEAD>LETTER LII.</HEAD>
<P>A PROMISE is with me a matter of mo&s;t A religious con&s;ideration, and as you are plea&s;ed to remind me of one I made to you, on a former occa&s;ion, with regard to Ta&s;&s;o's Geru|&s;alemne, I ha&s;ten to fulfil it by &s;ubmitting to you ane&s;timate of the merits of that work.</P>
<P>TO proceed on this after the manner in which Mr. Addi&s;on hath treated the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t vill be mo&s;t eligible; that is, fir&s;t to con&s;ider the faults of the work, then to exa|mine is worth under the di&s;tinct heads of Fable with its incidents, Per&s;ons, and Lan|guage.</P>
<P>THE faults of language have already been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a former Letter, to which I refer: tho&s;e that remain for pre&s;ent animadver&s;ion belong to the incidents and characters; and the defects of both are happily minute and rare.</P>
<P><PB N="459" REF="469">THE only incident, which I can condemn in the whole fable, is to be found in the Thirty-third, and following, &s;tanzas of the Fourteenth Canto, and a few &s;tanzas of the Fifteenth. The &s;tory of the old Magician; his connexion with Peter the Hermit; his dwelling (XV. 3. &amp;c.) are all unnatural to exce&s;s; <HI>ineredulus odi.</HI> To a good Chri&s;tian's being a Magician, in Lord Bacon's &s;en&s;e, I cannot confirm Mr. Ad|di&s;on's objection. The popular &s;uper&s;tition hath white wizards, and black wizards; magicians who deal with the demons of Platoni&s;in, and with devils. The Ea&s;tern creed makes Salo|mon a magician and pious prince, without &s;u&s;|picion of di&s;&s;onancy. It is not therefore to this per&s;on's being a pious magician that I object, but to the unnece&s;&s;ary miracles that are diffu&s;ed around him; not to the Character, but to the Incidents which attend it.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the faulty Characters in the Geru&s;alemme, I think that there are far too many female warriors in it. We are obliged to Virgil for the fir&s;t per&s;onage of this &s;ort; the vere &s;en&s;e of Homer admitted no &s;uch dreams. Dacier hath well ob&s;erved that a circum&s;tance
<PB N="460" REF="470">that is po&s;itive fact in real life, might yet be much too improbable for poetry. We know from hi&s;tory that Vermina, the daughter of Syphax, was in the field fighting in a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Hannibal, when he received his la&s;t defeat from Scipio; a circum&s;tance, which, being &s;o recent, probably &s;ugge&s;ted Camilla to Virgil. We know from hi&s;tory the martial &s;pirit of Bonduca, of many Scandinavian ladies, and the like; yet all the&s;e will not vindicate the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of female warriors into poetry, where the GRAND TRUTH OF NATURE is the object, not the paltry truth of fact. Ta&s;&s;o hath how|ever a very &s;trong apology to offer for his &s;ometimes making the word <HI>warrior</HI> of the feminine gender, and that is the coincidence of his &s;tory with the times and manners of chi|valry: times and manners which pre&s;ented &s;o many in&s;tances of this &s;oleci&s;m in <HI>co&s;tume,</HI> as almo&s;t to elevate truth of fact into truth of nature.</P>
<P>SO much for the faults of the Geru&s;alemme: they are not many; yet the eye of critical ju&s;tice will never be able to find more. The beauties fortunately pre&s;ent them&s;elves at more length.</P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="471">THE FABLE is certainly one, of the very be&s;t for epic poetry that ever was cho&s;en. It is &s;uperior to that of the Iliad, as much as the Sepulchre of Chri&s;t was thought at the period of the action, (and to which in all poetry we mu&s;t ever accommodate our minds,) to exceed the value of a &s;trumpet; as much as the object of the mo&s;t zealous adoration of half the globe was &s;uperior to the <HI>teterrima belli cau&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>THE Fable was &s;o grand and general, had Ta&s;&s;o managed it to its utmo&s;t advantage, as to intere&s;t every nation in Europe by the detail of the exploits of its own warriors. It may indeed be noted as a blemi&s;h in the conduct of the fable, that Ta&s;&s;o is always an Italian and not an European. He never dwells with appa|rent &s;atisfaction but upon the glorious deeds of his own countrymen, who had in fact the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare in the enterpri&s;e. Homer's fable only nationally intere&s;ted the Greeks and neighbouring &s;tates: Ta&s;&s;o's might have na|tionally intere&s;ted every country of Europe, had he u&s;ed it with proper liberality. As it &s;tands it is a great and intere&s;ting Fable to every reader; tho, it mu&s;t at the &s;ame time be
<PB N="462" REF="472">confe&s;&s;ed, that it might have been rendered more &s;o to an infinite degree.</P>
<P>MOST of the INCIDENTS mu&s;t be allowed to have great novelty and merit. None of them are foreign to the work, or can properly be called epi&s;odes, like Virgil's of Dido, which hath no &s;ort of relation to his fable. The in|cident of Olindo and Sophronia, tho one of the mo&s;t detached, is infinitely more a part of the Geru&s;alemme, than the adventure with Dido is of the Eneid; and were it much le&s;s &s;o, its eminent beauty mu&s;t preclude it from all cen|&s;ure: if we condemn it, we mu&s;t crown it with laurel. Mo&s;t of the incidents have moreover that plea&s;ing air of miracle, which offends not probability, and affords the genuine plea&s;ure of poetry to the reader. Tho&s;e incidents, around which this fairy light is not ca&s;t, maintain their native force with great dignity and in|tere&s;t. The grand incident of Armida's inter|vention, with its con&s;equences, is ma&s;terly to a &s;upreme degree: the miraculous is thro-out carried to all its height, yet with the con&s;tant pre&s;ervation of a &s;evere probability. The de|parture of Rinaldo from the camp is artfully
<PB N="463" REF="473">managed. Had he left it with the herd of warriors who followed Armida, the dignity of his character would have &s;uffered violation. A &s;tronger cau&s;e, and worthy of the effect, pre|&s;ents it&s;elf to us; and &s;aves the fame of Rinaldo and of Ta&s;&s;o.</P>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;equent amorous adventures of Rinaldo and Armida, Ta&s;&s;o appears to me to have taken the hint of from tho&s;e of Mars and Venus, as beautifully painted by the celebrated Agnolo Poliziano in his <HI>Stanze,</HI> written up|wards of half a century before the! Geru&s;a|lemme. If you have not read the Italian poetry of Poliziano, you have a great plea&s;ure yet to come. His <HI>Stanze</HI> are exqui&s;ite, and his Dithy|rambic Ode beginning
<Q><L>Ognun' &s;equa Baccho te!</L>
<L>Baccho, Baccho, evoe!</L>
<L>Chi vol bever, chi vol bevere</L>
<L>Vegna a bever, vegna qui, &amp;c.</L></Q>
to be found at the end of his <HI>Orfeo</HI> de&s;erves high prai&s;e. The be&s;t edition of his <HI>Stanze,</HI> &amp;c. is that of Padua 1765.</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="474">TO return. The pa&s;toral incident in the Seventh book is a delicious relief from the &s;cenes of war and horror which precede it. Nothing can have a more plea&s;ing effect on the imagination than &s;uch contra&s;ts, when managed with artificial propriety. The return to pro&s;|&s;pects of the greate&s;t horror and &s;ublimity in nature, which the after part of this Seventh Book pre&s;ents, is &s;till an example of the happy effect of contra&s;t of incident, which is never perceived but by a reader of &s;ome ta&s;te; whereas contra&s;t of character is glaring, and of no art or effect. It is always a &s;ure mark of a writer's inexperience in portraits when he is obliged to &s;et them off by foils.</P>
<P>THE incident of the death of Sueno and his ho&s;t in the Eighth Book, &s;eems to me more of an unnece&s;&s;ary epi&s;ode than the tale of Olindo and Sophronia, &s;o much objected to by &s;mall critics. It may be hi&s;toric truth, for aught I remember, for I have not now the <HI>Ge&s;ta Dei per Francos</HI> at hand, but I fear it is not poetic truth. <HI>Cui bono?</HI> What purpo&s;e doth it &s;erve? Yet, after all, he mu&s;t be a &s;evere critic who would range it with the faults of the Geru&s;alemme.
<PB N="465" REF="475">It bears a general connexion with the piece in different minute after relations; which is &s;urely enough for its vindication. Can &s;o much be &s;aid for the gho&s;t of Dido?</P>
<P>TO dwell on all the incidents of the Geru|&s;elemme were incon&s;i&s;tent with my purpo&s;e; I &s;hall therefore content my&s;elf with proceed|ing to hint at only the principal. Soliman's introduction to Aladin, in the Tenth Book, is a very great improvement on that of Uly&s;es to Alcinous in the Seventh book of the Ody&s;&s;ey. The whole adventure with I&s;meno is ma&s;terly, and &s;uperlatively plea&s;ing to the imagination. Ta&s;&s;o's very imitations are in that original &s;tyle, which, I think, you before agreed is the only po&s;&s;ible merit which imitation can have; and in fact none but original writers can imi|tate in this way.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of Clorinda is evidently built up|on the Ethiopic Hi&s;tory of Heliodorus, a work of the very fir&s;t merit. The incident of her dying by the hands of Tancred, her lover, is artfully wrought up, and hath no &s;mall claim to the pathetic.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="476">IN the Thirteenth Book the enchanted wood, and apparition of the city of fire, are incidents of miracle, <HI>&s;pecio&s;a, miracula,</HI> which approach to the &s;ublime. The principal incident of the next Canto hath already been mentioned in terms of reprobation.</P>
<P>IN the Fifteenth Canto the voyage of the two warriors is exqui&s;itely plea&s;ing to the imagination. Ta&s;&s;o, in the fir&s;t edition of his poem, made them go to America, and beyond; but well altered this, and confined their voyage to the length of the Canary or Fortunate i&s;lands. Indeed it was violation of probability to &s;uppo&s;e that three per&s;ons, natives of Europe were in America in the Eleventh century, and yet that continent remain undi&s;covered till the Fifteenth; tho the&s;e Europeans returned in &s;afety to a whole army of their countrymen, and mu&s;t have been &s;uppo&s;ed to have related this adventure to them in terms of due admi|ration. The fifteen re&s;cinded &s;tanzas are how|ever well worthy of Ta&s;&s;o, and as I dare &s;ay you have not &s;een them, I &s;hall give you one or two.</P>

<P>IN the Sixteenth Canto the incident of Ri|naldo's immediate a&s;&s;ent to the per&s;ua&s;ions of the two warriors is much too rapid. As it was the hinge upon which the cri&s;is of the poem turned, no art &s;hould have &s;pared to render it intere&s;ting by many difficulties and &s;olutions. The warriors inducing Rinaldo to li&s;ten to the expo&s;tulations of Armida is an ar|ticle &s;till more unfortunate. It was their part to hurry him off; his to delay.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance, in the next book, of the Soldan of Egypt giving the command of his va&s;t forces to a lieutenant is very ill imagined. It's being conformable to hi&s;tory were no ex|cu&s;e. Had the &s;oldan led them him&s;elf, and
<PB N="469" REF="479">fought him&s;elf with Godfrey, and fallen by his hand, more grandeur and more intere&s;t would have accrued to the cata&s;trophe of this immortal poem. Not to mention that a lieute|nant was an improper per&s;onage to be the com|mander of &s;o many auxiliary kings.</P>
<P>THE incidents in the Eighteenth Canto are, as u&s;ual with Ta&s;&s;o, very well ordered. The &s;cenes in the next are an exqui&s;ite relief from the repetition of general battles which is &s;o apt to di&s;gu&s;t. Erminia's meeting with Tancred is mo&s;t artfully contrived, and wrought up to no mean &s;hare of pathos. The adventures of Vafrino have all that intere&s;t which extreme danger, &s;uch as mu&s;t always attend the mo&s;t di&s;honourable office of a &s;py, never fail to rai&s;e.</P>
<P>IN the Twentieth and La&s;t Book Ta&s;&s;o hath drawn from Hi&s;tory the mo&s;t grand and in|tere&s;ting cata&s;trophe of any epic poem in the world without exception. The city of Jeru|&s;alem is taken, the &s;epulchre of Chri&s;t freed, in the Eighteenth Book. What then re|mained? Hi&s;tory tells us that, four or five
<PB N="470" REF="480">days after the taking the holy city, the va&s;t forces of the &s;ultan of Egypt, amounting to near 100,000 infantry, and 40,000 hor&s;e, came to a&s;&s;ail the victors now weakened by repeated conflicts to about 12,000 men if I remember right. Victory however declared in favour of the Chri&s;tians, with a &s;laughter of the enemy almo&s;t unparalleled. What a glorious cata&s;|trophe! A cata&s;trophe at the &s;ame time ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to fulfil the event. Ta&s;&s;o hath availed him&s;elf of it, as indeed a writer of half his talents mu&s;t have done. It hath al|ready been remarked that it might have been heightened; but, as it &s;tands, I do not he&s;itate to pronounce it the grande&s;t clo&s;e that an epic poem can po&s;&s;ibly have.</P>
<P>NOT to intrude too much on your patience, the further con&s;ideration of this wonderful poem &s;hall be deferred till a future occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>THE hypocri&s;y you laugh at is very com|mon. Literature hath its hypocri&s;ies as well as religion. That which you mention, in terms of ju&s;t deri&s;ion, is one of the mo&s;t fre|quent, where a man who is &s;en&s;ible that he hath &s;tudied a branch of &s;cience much, and knows the value of his opinions concerning it, yet pretends to &s;ubmit, with mode&s;t deference, to the &s;entiments of people who&s;e ignorance he knows to conviction. Can any hypocri&s;y be more gro&s;s? Were it not much more manly to a&s;&s;ume that noble <HI>confidentia &s;ui,</HI> one of the be&s;t of the ancient virtues, the parent of many other virtues, but now unknown to us, or unknown as a virtue? Is &s;incerity, that noble&s;t attribute of the moral character of man, to be &s;acrificed on the altar of fal&s;e mode&s;ty?</P>
<P>FROM principles of the &s;ame hypocri&s;y we often &s;ee opinions contrary to truth, but which happen to be affirmed by writers of e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="472" REF="482">reputation, a&s;&s;ented to in &s;ilence by others of equal talents, who know their fal&s;ity, but dare not &s;et their judgment again&s;t that of authors of celebrity; not from mode&s;ty, for that man cannot be found who will confe&s;s the mind of another to be &s;uperior to his own, but from ba&s;e hypocri&s;y of mode&s;ty. Independent of this vice of &s;imulation, Science would advance in the world with double rapidity. Names, and pretended deference to them, have been the great barriers in every age that have con|fined knowlege to half its proper bounds.</P>
<P>A YET more glaring literary hypocri&s;y is that by which an ignorant man a&s;&s;umes the garb of &s;cience; as the wor&s;t hypocri&s;y in the moral world is that by which a vicious man a&s;&s;umes the ma&s;k of religion. In the latter a hypocrite may often be di&s;covered by pu&s;hing his &s;imulation too far; and in the like manner a literary impo&s;tor is apt, not to di&s;play too much learning, for he hath got none; but, to u&s;e the character of a learned man in the ex|treme. He &s;hakes his head at the mo&s;t trivial que&s;tion, and, with many hems and ha's, &s;ays it is a difficult point, a very difficult point in|deed,
<PB N="473" REF="483">and would require very mature examina|tion. When any per&s;on pre&s;ent &s;ays the point is very ea&s;y, takes it in hand, and &s;olves it to the &s;atisfaction of every body, the hypocrite of learning &s;hakes his head, &s;ays that &s;olution is trivial; and perhaps is polite enough to hint that it equals the under&s;tanding of the audi|ence; but that he upon proper occa&s;ion, and to a learned company, could have given a much more profound account of the matter.</P>
<P>YOU cannot imagine, my dear friend, what an important thing a &s;hake of the head is. It makes a man look &s;o wi&s;e! I have known people get fame, plea&s;ure, opulence, only by &s;haking their heads; tho, God knows, to u&s;e a trite wittici&s;m, there was nothing in them. A &s;hake of the head from an ignorant man is learning; from a mean man, greatne&s;s; from a dull man, wit; from a &s;tupid man, genius; from a poor man, wealth; from a fool, wi&s;|dom. I wonder no wit &s;hould have written a treati&s;e <HI>On the art of &s;haking the head.</HI> It were &s;urely capable of much illu&s;tration; and no writer need be a&s;hamed of handling it, when he hath the example of Mr. Addi&s;on before
<PB N="474" REF="484">him, who hath written at &s;ome length <HI>On the art of furling the fan,</HI> an in&s;trument of equal vento&s;ity. But, lea&s;t you &s;hould be &s;haking your head at me all this while, I &s;hall here clo&s;e my Letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIV.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE heard it &s;eriou&s;ly debated in con|ver&s;ation that it is impo&s;&s;ible for any writer to obtain a fal&s;e fame, and that celebrity mu&s;t ever be the fruit of &s;ome proportion able merit. This opinion, as fal&s;e as it is plau&s;ible, de|&s;erves a confutation at &s;ome length from its important con&s;equences to the intere&s;ts of lite|rature.</P>
<P>THE fame of a good writer re&s;embles the de&s;cent of a pyramid, mo&s;t minute at fir&s;t, but &s;welling to an enormous ba&s;e, which &s;tands firm as the earth, and defies every tempe&s;t, and even the &s;ilent wa&s;te of time. Fal&s;e fame re&s;embles the pyramid likewi&s;e in every thing but its durability; but in another view, for it ri&s;es from a broad ba&s;e, and tapers to nothing. Hence that applau&s;e, which is wide at fir&s;t, is very &s;eldom la&s;ting; and durable reputation almo&s;t always &s;prings from very minute begin|nings.</P>
<P><PB N="476" REF="486">A good writer is &s;eldom or never popular at fir&s;t. His ideas are &s;o much out of the common line, that he is not under&s;tood, much le&s;s ta&s;ted, by the mob of his day. True judges, men of real &s;cience, are always his fir&s;t ad|mirers from congeniality of mind; and his fame, when &s;welled to a va&s;t river, is yet of the utmo&s;t purity, becau&s;e its &s;cources are clear. The applau&s;e of true judges is the only living fame which a writer of true ta&s;te can reli&s;h. When popular acclamation ri&s;es around him, he will be ready to &s;ay; with that an|cient Greek, upon hearing an unexpected roar of prai&s;e from the populace, whom he was ad|dre&s;&s;ing; <HI>Have I &s;aid a fooli&s;h thiug?</HI></P>
<P>THE opinion of men of learning always leads the mob, when it hath had a proper pe|riod to operate: the opinion of the mob is &s;eldom or never that of men of learning; and in no in&s;tance can lead it.</P>
<P>THE fame of the mo&s;t &s;uperlative writers is, even after thou&s;ands of years, always confined to &s;uperior minds: the popular acclaim is only an unmeaning echo of it. Du Bos hath well
<PB N="477" REF="487">ob&s;erved that the true reputation of Homer is at this day confined to tho&s;e who can read and admire him in the original; perhaps amounting to two hundred per&s;ons in the world: his other pretended admirers di&s;grace his genuine fame, and are the mere babbling echoes of the former.</P>
<P>THE like may be &s;aid of every &s;uperlative writer. Is Pindar, is Tacitus the minion of the populace? Our own Milton, our Shak&s;pere univer&s;al as he is, are not under&s;tood, or the lea&s;t reli&s;hed, by one per&s;on in a thou&s;and who echo their celebrity with open mouth. Were the genuine &s;entiments of the million enquired into, it would be di&s;covered that any fa&s;hion|able bauble of the diurnal kind is of far more e&s;timation, in their &s;ight, that the immortal labours of the&s;e glorious writers. What is the u&s;e of diamonds to them? Can they eat them? No, with the cock in the fable, grains of corn were better; and where corn is not to be had, even chaff.</P>
<P>BUT before the breeze of time that chaff vani&s;hes: while diamonds remain and blaze to eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="488">MEN of &s;uperior talents have it not in their power to adju&s;t the reputation of a work at once. They mu&s;t have time to con&s;ider it. Perhaps the author is known to many of them; and they tremble at the &s;u&s;picion of partiality. Perhaps they are carele&s;s; perhaps they are in|vidious; perhaps they are foes of the author.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE a work of real merit is, &s;ure to be neglected, for where &s;hall the cattle go when there is no guide? The little craft are coa&s;ting round their own paltry &s;hores, and know not that a new world is di&s;covered. If they did, how &s;hall they &s;ail to it, without powers, and without a compa&s;s? The &s;mall fi&s;hes they find at home are enough for them; they leave the exploration of the trea&s;ures of other climates to tho&s;e who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uperior means of navigation.</P>
<P>THE fame of few writers, who&s;e works are not of a more temporary kind, can be e&s;timated in the century in which they live. One hundred years of purgatory may with great ju&s;tice be looked, upon as a&s;&s;igned to mo&s;t authors before they pa&s;s to paradi&s;e or damna|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="489">ROUSSE AU I think ob&s;erves that the path to true fame, like that to the temple of virtue, is mo&s;t arduous and difficult: and it may be added that, where this difficulty is not found, it is much to be doubted that the path is not the true one.</P>
<P>I KNOW not however if living fame which is almo&s;t always fal&s;e, be not of more real moment to any writer, or arti&s;t, than po&s;thu|mous and eternal. The latter will never buy him a great coat; whereas the former heaps wealth and honours upon his happy head. Living fame is &s;weet mu&s;ic to the ears, tho one were even certain that it will die with us; po&s;thumous fame is unenjoyable by us, is of no exi&s;tence to us. The fal&s;e pre&s;cience of it affords high &s;ati&s;faction to the vain-glorious fool; but the true pre&s;cience of it &s;lightly af|fects the great and the wi&s;e.</P>
<P>IT hath already been ob&s;erved that legiti|mate celebrity is only to be found in the mouths of true judges, who are &s;ully as rare as good writers; in &s;o much that for fifty years after Milton's Comus was publi&s;hed, nobody knew
<PB N="480" REF="490">its worth but Sir Henry Wotton. The delay which true judges always adopt in pronouncing upon &s;uperior works, hath al&s;o been &s;tated. The public in the mean time, led by caprice or fa&s;hion, be&s;tow their applau&s;e, which they ought carefully to hoard for real merit, upon every gewgaw that comes in their way. Hence the number of fal&s;e reputations is almo&s;t in|finite; and in proportion to the true about one thou&s;and to one.</P>
<P>ANY per&s;on who-doubts if fame may ever be &s;urreptitiou&s;ly acquired, need only to look into the title pages, and cotemporary produc|tions, of a thou&s;and works of the la&s;t and pre|&s;ent century, In the fir&s;t he will &s;ee &s;ometimes the Twelfth edition of &s;ome poetical or other work which di&s;graces the human mind: in the la&s;t he will ob&s;erve the vain and tran&s;itory prai&s;es be&s;towed on it by writers of equal mi|nutene&s;s of intellect. For one in&s;tance in a thou&s;and of the&s;e facts, Cotton's Virgil Tra|ve&s;tie had Fourteen editions, Milton's Poems hardly two; and &s;ee the prai&s;es of the <HI>matchle&s;s Orinda's</HI> poems in Cowley, and others. Who was &s;he? Can there be a &s;tronger illu&s;tration of
<PB N="481" REF="491">my po&s;ition, that fal&s;e reputations actually exi&s;t? Nay I know that I could from this very century mu&s;ter up complete evidences of my po&s;ition, that they &s;urpa&s;s the true in the pro|portion of at lea&s;t one thou&s;and to one.</P>
<P>I KNOW not how it is, but it is certainly a more favourable &s;ymptom of a work to have enemies at fir&s;t, than admirers. The ingeni|ous author of the Book De l' E&s;prit, a work in which great talents are exerted to &s;upport bad principles, ob&s;erves with truth that &s;uperiority is &s;ure to create enemies, The maxim of mo&s;t people is that of the Ephe&s;ians, <HI>If any one ex|cells among us, let him go and excell el&s;ewhere.</HI> M. Helvetius hath aptly di&s;tingui&s;hed the e&s;teem profe&s;&s;ed for writers of repute into two &s;orts; an e&s;teem of prejudice, taken up upon the word of others, and an e&s;teem of &s;entiment. The la&s;t I call the only foundation of true fame, when it is the &s;entiment of a &s;uperior &s;oul. He marks Corneille as a writer who&s;e e&s;teem &s;tands wholly upon prejudice, and not &s;entiment.</P>
<P><PB N="482" REF="492">WHEN I mention popular fame, as of no account in forming our judgement of the worth of a modern writer, I do not mean to &s;peak but of works out of the common cla&s;s; works that give new forms to human talents. Works of them&s;elves merely popular, as novels, and the like, need not &s;tand the te&s;t of their century before their fame may be called per|manent.

<HEAD>LETTER LV.</HEAD>
<P>THE examination of the merits of Ta&s;&s;o's Geru&s;alemme &s;hall now, with your per|mi&s;&s;ion, be concluded. The Fable, with its Incidents, hath been the &s;ubject of former di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion: there now remain the Characters; the Language; the Particular Beauties. All which &s;hall be illu&s;trated with as much brevity as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>TO begin then with the Characters: Ta&s;&s;o yields only to Homer for the variety of his per&s;ons. Of their &s;trength I cannot &s;ay &s;o much: mo&s;t of the characters in the Geru&s;a|lemme might certainly, with much ea&s;e, have permitted great heightening of additional co|lours. His warriors are by no means ill di|ver&s;ified; Rinaldo is a mo&s;t di&s;tinct per&s;onage from Tancred, or Godfrey: and the like may with ju&s;tice be &s;aid of his other warriors. But to be a little more explicit.</P>
<P><PB N="485" REF="495">GODFREY, the chief commander, is de&s;cribed as a character of the fir&s;t value: prudent with courage; pious with genero&s;ity. Perhaps it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid that he is too perfect. Homer, the &s;ecretary of Nature, draws no per|fect characters. Gravina with great ingenuity and truth ob&s;erves that he almo&s;t alone of all writers paints the true manners and natural pa&s;&s;ions of men as they are. As in life it&s;elf, his virtuous characters have vice, and the vi|cious virtue. A writer without experience thinks the more perfect his characters are in vice or virtue, the more perfect they are in poetry. The rever&s;e is the truth. Mixt cha|racters are alone fit for the purpo&s;es of fable. Milton knew this &s;o well that he paints Satan him&s;elf as a dubious character.</P>
<P>RINALDO, perhaps the next in importance, is an admirable character, and new to epic poetry. His extreme youth, for, if I remember right, he is not eighteen at the period of the poem, makes his part extremely intere&s;ting. He is as different from Achilles as may be; tho the general idea of his part in the poem is evidently hinted by Homer.</P>
<P><PB N="486" REF="496">TANCRED again is a mo&s;t di&s;tinct per&s;onage from any other in the poem, tho to deduce the marks of di&s;tinction might require more room than we can now &s;pare.</P>
<P>THE old warrior RAYMOND hath nothing to do with Ne&s;tor. His old age makes his part fully as intere&s;ting, as the youth of Rinaldo doth his.</P>
<P>THE hermit PETER is a very fine and new per&s;onage; and might have given occa&s;ion for admirable painting, had Ta&s;&s;o but known how to avail him&s;elf of his fable to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>DUDON, GUELFO, SUENO, VAFRINO, and others, are all characters which at lea&s;t atone for their want of &s;trength by their variety. And the like may ju&s;tly be &s;aid even of the mo&s;t inferior characters in the poem. So much for the Chri&s;tian per&s;ons.</P>
<P>IF we pa&s;s to the Mahometan we &s;hall find equal variety with much more &s;trength. Ta&s;&s;o &s;eems to have thought that the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;|tem prevented any deep &s;hades of di&s;crimination
<PB N="487" REF="497">being thrown round a character; while the Mahometan, more indulgent to human frailty, left ample &s;cope for the natural man to &s;hew him&s;elf. In this view ALADIN, SOLIMAN, ALTAMORE, ISMENO, ARGANTES, EMIRENO, TISIPHERNES, are all characters of as much &s;trength as variety.</P>
<P>THAT of Soliman, the dethroned king of the Turks of A&s;ia Minor, combating again&s;t the Chri&s;tians who had dethroned him, is par|ticularly &s;trong, new, and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>THE part of ISMENO, the Magician, is no le&s;s &s;trong and new to epic poetry. Ta&s;&s;o hath in this, and other parts of his poem, admirably availed him&s;elf of the &s;y&s;tem of the middle ages, and of chivalry, to diver&s;ify his ma|chinery. Magic is certainly the mo&s;t fit for the purpo&s;es of poetry of any &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the world. Nothing is &s;o delight|ful to the imagination; and the imagination is the &s;ole judge of poetry.</P>
<P>OF the <HI>Female</HI> characters on both &s;ides I have already &s;poken; but even in their con|demnation mu&s;t confe&s;s that they have a fine variety.</P>
<P><PB N="488" REF="498">THE LANGUAGE of the Geru&s;alemme hath in general all that exqui&s;ite melody which is the grand characteri&s;tic of the Italian tongue. It hath not the &s;implicity of Homer, becau&s;e it was not written 2500 years ago; and they who look for pears upon an elm-tree will, as San|cho ob&s;erves, only find &s;ore eyes, Je&s;ting apart, nothing can well be more ab&s;urd and ridicu|lous, than to e&s;timate one writer's language, or other talents, by compari&s;on with tho&s;e of ano|ther. Nature knows no compari&s;ons. Ta&s;&s;o's language may boldly be pronounced as perfect in its kind as that of Homer. The fir&s;t is a monarch in laced cloths; the latter a monarch in plain. Is the fir&s;t le&s;s a king than the other?</P>
<P>THE language of Ta&s;&s;o I allow to be figura|tive; but contend that it is, with all its ex|qui&s;ite figures, much more correct, and to me more plea&s;ing, than the elegant negligence of Ario&s;to. The dre&s;s of the Geru&s;alemme is mo&s;t artfully inwoven, but it is inwoven with gold; and, with all its richne&s;s, is yet as ea&s;y and becoming as the &s;imple attire of &s;ome other poems. Every reader mu&s;t allow Milton's &s;tyle to be much more inverted and figurative than
<PB N="489" REF="499">that of Ta&s;&s;o: yet this hath never been laid to Milton's charge. So mad is prejudice!</P>
<P>THE &s;tanza u&s;ed by Ta&s;&s;o mu&s;t be allowed melodious, but its melody is uniform: and uniformity, the very wor&s;t fault ver&s;ification can have, is only to be avoided by u&s;ing blank ver&s;e.

<P>TASSO'S &s;tanza hath di&s;advantages: it ob|liges the writer thrice to u&s;e the &s;ame rimes; and to adopt tautology, or unnece&s;&s;ary addi|tion, that his &s;tanza may be completed with|out pa&s;&s;ing to another &s;ubject.

There is an infinite number of more minute di&s;crimina|tions of &s;cience; but, upon examination, we &s;hall find that true celebrity has only &s;prung from one or other of the&s;e greater &s;ources, or their divi&s;ions. The greater &s;ources are formed from a numerous variety of &s;prings, upon any of which if a candidate's bark is properly launched, he may be carried into the univer&s;al ocean of fame with &s;welling &s;ails. For example; in Na|tural Philo&s;ophy are contained Medicine, Che|mi&s;try, Botany, A&s;tronomy, Geometry, &amp;c. eminence in any of which is a &s;ure path to la&s;t|ing reputation: and the like is applicable to the other larger divi&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="503" REF="513">COMMON &s;en&s;e would lead us to think that the arts and &s;ciences, which are of mo&s;t utility to man, ought to be the highe&s;t objects of his e&s;teem. In this view to determine the propor|tion of legitimate applau&s;e, which a &s;uperla|tive performance of any kind ought to have, we would only need to cla&s;s it according to its real utility. Experience, however, is again&s;t this: for a capital poet or painter hath always larger and more la&s;ting fame, than an inventor of the mo&s;t u&s;eful art. This is ea&s;ily account|ed for. The inventor of an u&s;eful art is &s;oon forgotten, becau&s;e any art that is merely u&s;e|ful cea&s;es almo&s;t with its invention to rai&s;e any admiration. Its daily u&s;e of it&s;elf precludes all gratitude to the inventor. Men, in their ingratitude, in&s;tead of wondering at the invent|tion, only wonder why the art was not di&s;co|vered before. Be&s;ides, the mo&s;t u&s;eful art, if of trivial u&s;e, tho it may require the utmo&s;t power of mind to form the fir&s;t idea of it, yet can be improved by almo&s;t every body: and the&s;e additional improvements totally &s;tifle the fir&s;t fame of the inventor. Not to mention that the name of the arti&s;t never appears on products of u&s;eful art, nor do their products
<PB N="504" REF="514">them&s;elves la&s;t, how then can his fame be pre&s;erved? If it is, it mu&s;t be in writing, the only immortal art we know: but he who pre|&s;erves the fame of others in writing of any kind is certainly the more immediate heir of fame than tho&s;e who&s;e names he pre&s;erves. Hence authors them&s;elves are the &s;ure&s;t po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors of celebrity; and, next to them, tho&s;e whom they conde&s;cend to applaud. Hence we &s;hould know nothing of the ancient painters, mu&s;icians, and other arti&s;ts, did not we read of them in ancient volumes. Hence Homer will always inherit more renown than the in|ventor of the windmill; tho I &s;u&s;pect a rigid philo&s;opher would decide, that the reputation of the latter ought to &s;tand highe&s;t, becau&s;e he de&s;erves be&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>IT is from facts, then, and not from theory, that we &s;hould form an e&s;timate of the degrees of &s;cientific fame. One who accurately weighs the e&s;timation, in which the re&s;pective arts and &s;ciences are held by men of erudition, who are their only genuine judges, will find the &s;cale to be much of this tenor.</P>

When he hath done this, with a &s;afety which valour always en&s;ures, you can|not imagine how proud Mr. Pilot is. Like the

He derives from the &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition, not arguments of enterpri&s;e for others of like adventure, but chilling di&s;&s;ua&s;ions and tales of danger; in&s;o|much that, very much owing to his cowardly information, voyages to new latitudes of art are very rare; and the man who attempts them with &s;ucce&s;s may well be pronounced to have talents &s;uperior to tho&s;e which found a &s;tate, or &s;hake a potent empire to its inmo&s;t found|ations.</P>
<P>CRITICISM may be defined to be, That &s;cience by which we are taught to form pro|per judgements of the merits, and defects, of the other arts and &s;ciences. I have called Cri|tici&s;m a &s;cience, and not an art, becau&s;e it is theoretical and not practical; becau&s;e there can be no art where there is no room for inven|tion: becau&s;e Critici&s;m is merely a &s;cience,
<PB N="508" REF="518">and re&s;ts &s;olely upon knowlege in the points of which it treats; and that knowlege, if you will, is not even a &s;cience <HI>per &s;e,</HI> but ari&s;es from the mental exertion of others; yet does not a&s;cend to analogy like other human &s;ciences. For in&s;tance; were a critic to judge from ana|logy that, becau&s;e the beginning of the Iliad is &s;imple, that of every epic poem ought to be &s;o, he would judge wrong; for this rea&s;on that a man of genius, his ma&s;ter, would tell him that there ought to be no analogy in poetry, and that the &s;implicity of Homer's beginning is a fault, not a beauty, for the great point of opening an epic poem is to rai&s;e the very ut|mo&s;t expectation; and, allowing it a beauty, it is a beauty to be avoided by other writers, becau&s;e any appearance of imitation never fails to di&s;gu&s;t a &s;uperior judge.</P>
<P>CRITICISM, if I mi&s;take not, originated with Ari&s;totle, who was as &s;ond of &s;ubduing the mental world, as his pupil Alexander was of conquering the habitable. After that this Ari&s;|totle, by dint of many a ba&s;e trick and cavil, to be found in Athenaeus, Elian, and other writers of antiquity, had u&s;urped a tyrannical power
<PB N="509" REF="519">over almo&s;t every branch of &s;cience, he was, like his mad di&s;ciple, weeping for other worlds to vanqui&s;h. After conquering the Earth in his Political and Moral works, he had, upon the air-balloon of pre&s;umption, to u&s;e a meta|phor which &s;mells a little of anachroni&s;m, vi|&s;ited Mercury in his Topics, the Moon in his Treati&s;e on the Soul, Venus in his Natural Hi&s;tory, Mars in his Treati&s;e on Rhetoric, Jupiter in his treati&s;e on Heaven, Saturn in his other works. The planet of Poetry, like Her|&s;chel's di&s;covery, was then rolling in new radiance thro the wa&s;tes of aether. To it goes Mr. Ari&s;totle upon his air balloon, and return|ing tells us all about it. To drop the allegory, ere it grows. &s;tale; to an impartial reader, who is able to judge for him&s;elf, it mu&s;t be matter of infinite &s;urprize how the authority of .Ari&s;|totle &s;hould ever be any thing in poetry. All he hath done is to give a parcel of metaphy&s;ical names, his common trick, to different points of poetry; which points he draws without any invention or addition from Homer and Sophocles. He then &s;its down with as much &s;atisfaction as that Indian chief, who gets up every morning before &s;un-ri&s;e; &s;teps to the door of his cabin,
<PB N="510" REF="520">marks with his finger the cour&s;e the &s;un is to pur&s;ue in his day's journey, which he always takes care &s;hall be the u&s;ual one; and then re|turns in the glory of having given his direc|tions to <HI>the &s;un his brother.</HI></P>
<P>THE only thing Ari&s;totle did in critici&s;m was to give &s;ome names, almo&s;t as unentelli|gible as that <HI>entelecheia</HI> which hath cracked the brains of all his commentators, to diffe|rent articles. He &s;eems only to have &s;trutted into the theatre of poetry to drop the curtain of ob&s;curity over the &s;cene of nature; a de|merit which the meane&s;t menial belonging to the hou&s;e could have had &s;ufficient ability to incur the blame of as well as him&s;elf. Perhaps you will think this cen&s;ure of Ari&s;totle &s;evere, but do not imagine it &s;ingular: the awful &s;hades of Vittorius, Ca&s;telvetro, Gravina, the two la&s;t names in critici&s;m &s;uperior to that of Ari&s;totle, ri&s;e around me in its defence.</P>
<P>THIS mention of the earlie&s;t ancient critic might induce a review of the other critical writers of antiquity, by which indeed we &s;hould be better enabled to judge of the nature of cri|tici&s;m,
<PB N="511" REF="521">than by theoretic rea&s;oning. But to give this at proper length would require other bounds, and deeper di&s;qui&s;ition than the brief &s;tyle of a letter will authori&s;e. The other cri|tics of antiquity you know are Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us; the author of the treati&s;e under the name of Demetrius Phalereus; Hermo|genes; Longinus; among the Greeks:&mdash;and among the Latins <HI>in&s;tar omnium,</HI> Quintilian, the only critic who ever de&s;erved the name. To the three fir&s;t may with ju&s;tice be applied the noted di&s;tich,
<Q><L>Turpe e&s;t di&s;&s;ciles habere nugas:</L>
<L>Stultus et labor e&s;t ineptiarum.</L></Q>
Of Longinus the fourth I &s;hall only repeat the ju&s;t verdict of an Italian critic of the fir&s;t re|pute; namely, that he wrote on the &s;ublime in a total ignorance of what it was. His work is in fact more applicable to the beautiful, than to the &s;ublime; a &s;ure proof that he knew not what he was writing about. His prai&s;e of Neptune's hor&s;es leaping, like &s;o many fleas in a blanket, is one in&s;tance of at lea&s;t twenty of his fal&s;e ta&s;te. If it be &s;ublime to make the god's ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;es go &s;o far at two, or at three leaps,
<PB N="512" REF="522">were it not far more &s;o to de&s;cribe them as leaping the whole &s;pace at once? Can there be a &s;ublime beyond which in its kind the mo&s;t common mind may form conceptions? Surely not. Homer's idea is burle&s;que, and an in&s;tance of the fal&s;e &s;ublime, for this plain rea&s;on, that it pre&s;ents a ri&s;ible, and not a great image.</P>
<P>TO Quintilian the highe&s;t reverence is due, as the only ancient writer in pro&s;e who knew how to critici&s;e with &s;ound &s;en&s;e and integrity of mind.</P>
<P>WHAT Quintilian is in pro&s;e, Horace is in poetry. His remarks, for the very term of cri|tical <HI>precepts,</HI> which I was about to u&s;e, implies deri&s;ion, are tho&s;e of a ma&s;ter; yet like tho&s;e of all critics are to be &s;trongly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the reader's own judgement: and in this view many of them will lie pro&s;trate on the ground, like &s;o many fal&s;e idols before the deity of truth. This will always be the ca&s;e with &s;uch critici&s;ms as have no rea&s;ons alleged in their &s;upport; which are ever fully as ab&s;urd in the eyes of a reader of &s;cience as the verdict of a judge would be, ere he had lent an ear to the pleadings, and recapitulated the cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="513" REF="523">FROM the great rarity of good critics of an|tiquity tho&s;e of modern days ought to judge of the extreme difficulty of writing with &s;uch propriety as to &s;ecure the fame of future ages. Ju&s;t critici&s;m it&s;elf is a dangerous province, upon the very boundaries of the empire of &s;cience; where, becau&s;e of its di&s;tance from the capital, the renown is by no means proportioned to the greatne&s;s of ability and enterprize ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be exerted. To form a proper cri|tical e&s;timation of any work, the Iliad for in|&s;tance, in all its parts would, I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ert, re|quire talents double the &s;ize of the author's. For, if they are only equal, the mind of the critic will be homogeneous with that of the poet: he will con&s;equently be capable of con|ceiving nothing beyond the work; and his performance will con&s;i&s;t only of &s;light efforts of admiration, and of blame; not of &s;uch &s;u|perior critical di&s;qui&s;ition as may improve the art of which he treats; and which alone forms the e&s;&s;ence of ju&s;t critici&s;m. Suppo&s;e even that a critic &s;hould ari&s;e with twice the mental powers of Homer, an event that will never happen; &s;uppo&s;e that his work had every per|fection of critici&s;m, wide views, profound re|&s;earch,
<PB N="514" REF="524">boundle&s;s trea&s;ures of erudition; &s;up|po&s;e it di&s;played a mind, that, like a tele&s;cope, could magnify di&s;tant worlds of genius, and &s;hew them to the common eye; and at the &s;ame time, with micro&s;copic powers, could examine the mo&s;t minute particle of phra&s;e; what, with all the&s;e &s;upernatural attributes, would be the proportion of his fame? Very &s;mall. The man of genius, like the &s;un, would dazzle nations; while he a little planet of borrowed light would only glitter in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>IN &s;peaking of critici&s;m I have avoided treat|ing of &s;y&s;tematic, becau&s;e the ancients knew no &s;uch thing; it was left for the folly of the moderns to frame elements of univer&s;al criti|ci&s;m. An attempt than which nothing can be more ab&s;urd; for if no critic hath yet ari&s;en able fully to di&s;cu&s;s one particular branch of this &s;cience, what &s;hall we &s;ay of him who boldly undertakes to examine and illu&s;trate the whole?</P>
<P>THE only work that could prove of real ad|vantage in critici&s;m would be a &s;election of all the remarks made by illu&s;trious writers relative to this &s;tudy, accompanied with a mode&s;t ex|planation
<PB N="515" REF="525">and commentary, &s;upported by ex|amples. Such a work would go further to be of genuine utility to the arts and &s;ciences than any &s;pecies of &s;y&s;tem, tho dige&s;ted by a critic of the mo&s;t uncommon powers of mind.</P>
