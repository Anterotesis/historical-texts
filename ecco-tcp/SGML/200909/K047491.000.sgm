<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>MR. Martin, good morning! you are abroad very early. Have you alter'd your hour of ri&s;ing, or are you troubled with a bad con&s;cience?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>I make you as early a vi&s;it as this is, my dear girl, each morning of my life&mdash;in imagi|nation;&mdash;but I now pay my duty to you in per|&s;on, and by order of my ma&s;ter. He, poor &s;oul! full of anxiety, bad me attend your lev&eacute;e for an account of the health of that &s;weet &s;wain his uncle, How has he pa&s;&s;ed the night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never wor&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heav'n be prai&s;ed! The old fellow mu&s;t have had a noble con&s;titution, or he never could have &s;tood buff; at once to &s;o many di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true. He has twice within the&s;e two days fallen into my arms in a profound lethargy:
<PB N="2" REF="6">and, I believe, no earthly care but mine could have revived him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>O cur&s;e your care! And pray how are you rewarded?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I can't &s;ay I have either pre&s;ent pay, or good quarters. He &s;eems &s;en&s;ible of my good offices; but begs to be excu&s;ed the paying for them.&mdash;He, indeed, promi&s;es faithfully to remem|ber me in his Will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, is he going to make one at la&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Immediately&mdash;where my name, I believe, will make no &s;mall figure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heav'n &s;end it, &s;ay I!&mdash;the old fellow mu&s;t be very rich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rich! &s;o he had need be to &s;atisfy all tho&s;e who are gaping for his death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>He'll treat them with a mouthful of moon&s;hine. My ma&s;ter flatters him&s;elf the be&s;t part of the wealth will fall to his lot. I think, I, as a relation, am entitled to a legacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>A relation! You!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes I&mdash;My ma&s;ter and his uncle are re|lations, that can't be deny'd.&mdash;My late wife was as obliging as &s;he was hand&s;ome&mdash;indeed we were look'd on as the mo&s;t agreeable couple in the pa|ri&s;h&mdash;but let that pa&s;s. She, I &s;ay, by a &s;mall ex|ertion of that good nature for which &s;he was re|markable, took care that my ma&s;ter and I &s;hould be kin. O, I'm certainly one of the family.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>At that rate, I believe, you are related to more families than this. O wedlock would be a wealthy &s;tate indeed if hu&s;bands could inherit by &s;uch a title.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, true&mdash;but joking apart&mdash;'tis ne|ce&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould do every thing in our power to forward this will, get it made, and to our
<PB N="3" REF="7">liking too&mdash;for if my ma&s;ter &s;hould not be remem|bered by the old gentleman, he mu&s;t, the re&s;t of his days, take up with very &s;pare diet. But what is mo&s;t materially to be con&s;idered, is the reward of five hundred, which he has promi&s;ed to give you and me, as &s;ecret &s;ervice money, on the day of his marriage with Myra: and which, to avoid di&s;putes concerning dividends, you have con&s;ented &s;hall be common &s;tock, and we are to follow their example. O, here comes my ma&s;ter.&mdash;</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SAVILLE.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear Lucetta, what news? af|ford me &s;ome comfort! How is my poor uncle? How has he pa&s;&s;ed the night? Can he bear com|pany? May I be permitted to &s;ee him this morn|ing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sir, he has pa&s;&s;ed the night very ill; and, if I can form any judgment, he has not a right to expect many more on this &s;ide the grave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good heav'n! What &s;ay you, Lucetta? Notwith&s;tanding my great expectations, duty and nature are very powerful in me; and his approach|ing end cau&s;es certain emotions, which you cannot feel, or I de&s;cribe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot an&s;wer for her feelings, or your de&s;criptions; but as to emotions, I believe they are &s;uch as I felt when I paid the la&s;t duties to my poor dear wife of pious memory. I found my&s;elf attacked by a kind of a certain fort of a&mdash;flow&mdash;pungent&mdash;plea&s;ing&mdash;melancholy&mdash;that had &s;uch an effect on my &s;pirits, that&mdash;as if&mdash;in &s;hort, as you &s;ay, Sir, it is a &s;ituation ea&s;ier felt than told, and what many a married man wi&s;hes to experi|ence,
<PB N="4" REF="8">that he may become a more competent judge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;I believe the old gentleman begins to think him&s;elf in a bad way at la&s;t; for he has or|dered me to provide two proctors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>My heart throbs to find my fate &s;o near its cri&s;is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be of good cheer, Sir; I believe all will go well: within the&s;e two days he and your mi|&s;tre&s;s's mother, Mrs. Watchly, were laying their heads together, and in deep muttering for &s;ome time&mdash;Deeds&mdash;legacies&mdash;marriages, and &s;o forth; and I make no doubt the main point was making a conditional match for you and the young lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't flatter me, Lucetta. Heaven is my witne&s;s, I &s;hould not think wealth worth a wi&s;h, did it not &s;horten the journey of my de&s;ires to my dear Myra.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Sir, you are in a fair way of having both&mdash;Nay, I make no doubt of your being &s;ole heir.&mdash;Troth 'twould grieve me to &s;ee the &s;tock divided: for, Sir, I know you would do a world of good with it.&mdash;Now, as to your pro|mi&s;e to Martin and me, I know&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more of that, Lucetta: I remem|ber my promi&s;e, and will be even better than my word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir, I don't doubt your genero&s;ity: and I hope I may venture to &s;ay, I &s;hall not be al|together unworthy. I have always kept prai&s;ing you and your good qualities to the old gentleman. &mdash;Lord, Sir, &s;ays I, how happy are you in &s;uch a nephew! &s;o &s;weet a di&s;po&s;ition! &s;o complai&s;ant! &s;o re&s;pectful! not urged to attend you, like mo&s;t of your relations, from a principle of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, but by a regard of the mo&s;t delicate and tender nature.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>You hear, Sir, how well &s;he knows and de&s;cribes you&mdash;to &s;ay the truth, Sir, I think you can no more over-rate <HI>her</HI> merit, than &s;he can over|prai&s;e <HI>yours.</HI></P>

<P>That you are not quite di&s;intere&s;ted in your recommendation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the truth is, Sir, the poor girl has ca&s;t a favourable eye on the per&s;on and good qua|lities of your humble &s;ervant, and I have con|&s;ented to follow your example. I'm &s;ure, Sir, you can't blame me for taking pity on her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pity, Sauce-box! pity!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, that di&s;&s;embled anger becomes you mightily. You &s;ee, Sir, &s;he has her attractions; &s;he's young, hand&s;ome, <HI>en bon point;</HI> and&mdash;I had better not be too lavi&s;h neither, le&s;t he &s;hou'd take a fancy to her too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hu&s;h! I hear the old gentleman. You have detain'd me &s;o long here, I &s;han't be able to go to the Proctors. Run you, Martin, directly, and tell them to come hither; they both live in Doctor's Commons; one is named Caveat, the other Item.&mdash;go.&mdash;</P>

<P>I think, Sir, you look much better than when I &s;aw you la&s;t&mdash;But, Sir, I really think you don't do your&s;elf ju&s;tice; your frame mu&s;t be much weaken'd by your di&s;order, and you neglect the proper applications to re&s;tore it.</P>
