<HEAD>TRAVELS THROUGH Siberia and Tartary, PROVINCES OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE;</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY S. PALLAS, M. D. PROFESSOR OF NATURAL HISTORY, &amp;c.</BYLINE>
<DIV2 N="3 (cont.)" TYPE="part">
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART III. CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now &s;peak of the Jugrian and Obdirian Samojedes; Mr. Surjef having had an opportunity, in the above northern tour, of &s;eeing a good deal of them: yet the accounts he brought are, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, imperfect; as but few Samojedes live in the di&s;tricts of Obdor&s;kaja; and the re&s;t, having partly mixed them|&s;elves with the Ea&s;tjaiks, by marriage.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">The Samojedes, who call them&s;elves Cha&s;owa, or Gho&s;ovo, that is, <HI>men,</HI> were made tributary to the Ru&s;&s;ian empire &s;o early as 1525; whereas, the other nations of Siberia, were not conquered till the 17th century. They inhabit the coa&s;ts of the frozen &s;ea, from the 65th degree of north-latitude, to the &s;ea|&s;hore; that is, all the northern di&s;tricts of Ru&s;&s;ia and Siberia, as far as to the Jeni&s;ei, but are within this di&s;trict, divided into many tribes, different even in their dialects. Probably all tho&s;e, to whom the Ru&s;|&s;ians give the name of Samojedes, are not of the &s;ame origin. What is &s;aid here, is meant of tho&s;e Samojedes who live between the river Ob, and the Jugrian mountains.</P>
<P>Nothing more probable can be concluded, but that the whole of this people mu&s;t originally have been one nation, expelled by war from their abodes, and who &s;ettled on the extreme boundaries of the northern he|mi&s;phere. This nation mu&s;t long have inhabited a cold and mountainous country, and have there lived a wandering life; otherwi&s;e, they would have been un|able to have continued in &s;o rude a climate, where others can hardly bear the winter, &s;heltered in commo|dious dwellings; neither could they have pre&s;erved the u&s;e of moveable huts, if they had not originally been wanderers. Add to this, there are, in the ea&s;tern parts of Siberia, about the Jeni&s;ei, where the country, ac|cording to every appearance and token, has been once
<PB N="5" REF="5">
more populous, a po&s;terity of that nation in the neighbouring Sajanian mountains, in the Koibals, Kamat&s;chinzes, Matores, Sojetes, and Karaga&s;&s;ians, who all &s;peak the Samojede language. This na|tion, indeed, does not recollect that it came from the ea&s;t; but it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that their trouble|&s;ome and dangerous mode of living, may have ef|faced, in a few ages, &s;uch a remembrance from their memory.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t northern part of the di&s;trict of Bere&s;owa, inhabited by the Samojedes, is divided by the gulph of the river Ob, into two di&s;tricts; of which the we&s;t|ern, or Kamennaja, is bounded by the di&s;trict of Pu&s;|do&s;er&s;kaja, lying from Archangel to the &s;ource of the river Sob, along the Jugrian mountains, Kar&s;koi. The other, called Ni&s;owaja, runs ea&s;tward from the gulph of the Ob; and is bounded by the di&s;trict of the Juriakian Samojedes, dependent on Manga&s;ei.</P>
<P>"The European Samojedes," &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI> <Q>extend from the White Sea, or rather from the river Me&s;en, to Mount Ural. The A&s;iatic Samojedes occupy the countries between Mount Ural, and the environs of the Lena, to beyond the Jeni&s;ei; tho&s;e of Euro|pean Ru&s;&s;ia, live &s;eparately; tho&s;e of Siberia, are &s;ettled partly in the vicinage of the Ea&s;tjaiks, or mixed with them. The countries they occupy are mar&s;hy, and full of rocks; &s;o that, from the 67th
<PB N="6" REF="6">
degree of latitude, there are no trees of any kind; and that cold which prevails in the&s;e climates, pre|vents vegetation to &s;uch a point, that even the little bru&s;hwood here and there to be &s;een, dwindles away to nothing, as we advance towards the north. Al|though they do not inhabit Nova Zembla, &s;ituated over again&s;t the mouth of the Ob, neverthele&s;s, to the ea&s;tward of the Jene&s;ei, the &s;hores, along which their little &s;ettlements extend, reach to the 75th de|gree of north latitude; for which rea&s;on, their va&s;t territories are the thinne&s;t of inhabitants, the rude&s;t, and the mo&s;t barren and wild, of any of the known regions of the terre&s;trial globe.</Q></P>
<P>The Samojedes are, in appearance and language, entirely different from the Ea&s;tjaiks; the latter being, in phy&s;iognomy, more like the Ru&s;&s;ians, and mo&s;t like the Finlanders; but the Samojedes have almo&s;t the look of a Tungu&s;e, round, broad, and flat faces (very fine in the women); pouching, broad lips, a flat and open no&s;e, little or no beard, and black, coar&s;e hair. Their &s;tature is rather &s;hort than middling; but well-propor|tioned, and more nervous and fle&s;hy than the Ea&s;t|jaiks. In their manners, they are much more &s;avage, more uncivilized and ungovernable, in their open and di&s;tant wilds, than the Ea&s;tjaiks, who are much improved, by their frequent intercour&s;e with the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"><FIGURE>

</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">The man's dre&s;s differs but little from that of the Ea&s;tjaiks. Some &s;have their heads partially, &s;ome wholly, and &s;ome not at all. Some wear but one whi&s;ker on one &s;ide, and others on both &s;ides, the chin. The women's dre&s;s is &s;ingular. They go always bare-headed, and bare-faced; and are, in other re&s;pects, very impudent. Their hair is braided into two tre&s;&s;es, which hang down behind, and are never opened. In their ears they wear &s;hort, bead pendants. The brea&s;t and back-pieces of their garments, are made of the furs of young rein-deer; and the re&s;t, pieces of cloth &s;ewed together; the whole bordered with fur, and made to lap over before, and there tied with a girdle. In&s;tead of a brea&s;t-pin, they have a large, iron ring, on which both ends of the girdle are tied. They al&s;o wear breeches, of died, rein-deer &s;kins; but they do not follow the ridiculous cu&s;tom of the Ea&s;tjaik women, which I have mentioned, and wear the willow-tent, and worop. In this dre&s;s, the Samojede women re|main day and night; but the men &s;leep, without any cloaths; and, but for the&s;e breeches, would be quite naked.</P>
<P>As the Samojedes live an un&s;ettled life, both in &s;um|mer and winter, and are always roving about with their tents, covered with rein-deer &s;kins, in woodle&s;s plains, their uncleanline&s;s is not &s;o ob&s;ervable in winter, as among the &s;tinking Ea&s;tjaiks; yet they are in no wi&s;e le&s;s filthy in their per&s;ons, and manner of eating.
<PB N="8" REF="9">
Each Samojede keeps his own rein-deer, and he and his family, watch them them&s;elves; the more wealthy ones hire poor people, as &s;hepherds. The&s;e dome&s;tic animals are chiefly employed to tran&s;port their tents and effects, on &s;ledges. They do not know how to milk them, and their numbers are too &s;mall to kill them; indeed, their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors are too covetous to do it. Their chief living is hunting, like many nations of North America; e&s;pecially that of wild rein-deer, which they catch in many different ways, as &s;hall be mentioned below. The wild rein-deer furni&s;hes the Samojede with every nece&s;&s;ary he wants, <HI>viz.</HI> food, roofs, &s;pades which they make of the horn, clothes, and &s;inews for thread, &amp;c. &amp;c. When they live near the &s;ea, they have &s;ufficient &s;ub&s;i&s;tance from the &s;ea-bears that come on &s;hore, dead whales thrown up by the waves, and other animals, which they eat indi&s;crimi|nately. <Q>Dogs, cats, ermines, &s;quirrels, and &s;nakes; in &s;hort, whatever they can kill, or find dead: no|thing comes ami&s;s to them.</Q> They &s;ometimes fi&s;h in the gulph and lakes, with &s;mall nets made of wil|low-ba&s;t, and ropes of willow-rods. In autumn, they hunt ice-foxes, which are not only caught by the men in traps, and &s;ometimes pur&s;ued, but even dug out of their holes by their wives, and killed. There are wealthy Samojedes, who, for the &s;ake of fi&s;hing, will take up their &s;ummer-abode on the river Ob, and leave the care of their flocks to their children, and &s;hepherds; yet, when the time of hunting approaches, will return
<PB N="9" REF="10">
to their old way of living. When a Samojede has killed a rein-deer, nothing is lo&s;t. They fir&s;t cut off the animal's ears, (this is done on the &s;pot where he is killed) and throw them away, as an offering to their gods, to obtain, future, good luck in hunting; the leg bones are taken out, &s;plit with a knife, and the marrow is eaten raw: &s;o do they eat raw the warm and bloody brains, and con|&s;ider them as a great dainty. The eyes are buried in a certain &s;pot; and no woman or girl is &s;uffered to pa&s;s over this &s;pot, le&s;t it &s;hould de&s;troy their &s;ucce&s;s in hunting. In the &s;pring, when the rein-deer has new horns, which are knotty and rough, they will eat the&s;e horns, only &s;ingeing off the hair, and even the old horns they will brui&s;e and boil, and make &s;trong glue of, by mixing it with the blood of the &s;ame animal. When more families are boiling, for they have but one kettle among four or five families, the re&s;t of the meat is boiled, and every one eats his portion of in his own tent. The wife, however, cannot eat with her hu&s;band, but is contented with what he leaves.</P>
<P>The female &s;ex is in general u&s;ed wor&s;e by the Sa|mojedes than the Ea&s;tjaiks. They have every dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s to perform, to put the luggage on the &s;ledges, &amp;c. and notwith&s;tanding they are quite &s;laves to their hu&s;bands, the latter are continually &s;colding and cur&s;|ing them except a few evenings in the year, when love,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
for a moment, &s;oftens their &s;avage brea&s;ts. Nothwith|&s;tanding this, the women are con&s;iderd by their hu&s;bands as impure creatures. When a woman has erected a tent &s;he dares not enter it, till &s;he has &s;moked her&s;elf and every thing &s;he &s;its on, and even the &s;ledge &s;he car|ries into the hut, with rein-deer hair. When &s;he unloads the &s;ledge by untying the cloths upon it, &s;he cannot do it from above, but mu&s;t creep under the &s;hafts and do it. So on a journey, no woman can cro&s;s a train or row of rein-deer &s;ledges following each other, but mu&s;t either run round the whole, or creep underneath the &s;hafts. Even in the hut a &s;taff is erected behind the fire, the limits of which &s;he dares not pa&s;s, for they deem the fire &s;acred, and think a woman going round it would profane it. To do her dome&s;tic work, if &s;he wants to go from one &s;ide of the hut to the other, &s;he mu&s;t go round about. For the Samojedes ab&s;olutely believe, that if a woman is at liberty to go about the whole tent, a wolf will certainly devour a rein-deer the &s;ame night, and the Ea&s;tjaiks who keep rein-deer have adopted the &s;ame &s;uper&s;titious notions. For no woman or marriageable girl is &s;uffered to eat of the head of a rein-deer. In the time of their men&s;es, they are plagued beyond mea&s;ure. They mu&s;t often under|go purification by &s;moking them&s;elves with rein-deer hair, or ca&s;tor, nor are they &s;uffered at &s;uch times, to dre&s;s any food for their hu&s;bands, or hand them the lea&s;t thing. It is the &s;ame after lying-in; the hu&s;band does not cohabit with his wife for two months. At this pe|riod,
<PB N="11" REF="12">
&s;he is not to eat any provi&s;ions fre&s;h-killed, but mu&s;t put up with old provi&s;ions; but the wor&s;t of all cu&s;toms is this: the lea&s;t pain in child-birth cau&s;es an immediate &s;u&s;picion that &s;he has had &s;ome illicit connection with other men, and &s;he is therefore left to &s;uffer, in order to extort a confe&s;&s;ion from her. A European dame would de&s;pi&s;e this, but the poor Sa|mojede, in order to have a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will confe&s;s an intrigue, &s;he was, perhaps, never concerned in. This confe&s;&s;ion however, has no bad con&s;equence. If the delinquent be a near relation, the woman does not name him, but the hu&s;band immediately gue&s;&s;es the per&s;on, and makes him accountable whether innocent or guilty. If it be any one el&s;e, &s;he names him, and he is called upon to defray the con&s;equent expences of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he put his friend to, without being ap|plied to for it.</P>
<P>When a Samojede wants a wife, he looks for one in &s;ome other family than his own: he never cares for beauty, but cho&s;es one equal to him&s;elf in rank and property. Having appointed a negociator of the bu|&s;ine&s;s from among his own friends, whom it is cu&s;tomary to reward with a rein-deer for his trouble; with this man and his relations he goes to the habitation of the girl's father, and being arrived, no one pre|&s;umes to enter the hut, but ranging all their &s;ledges in a row, each man &s;itting on his own, while the negociator waits upon the father of the young wo|man,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
and enquires whether the young man can have her. If the father refu&s;es, which is but &s;eldom the ca&s;e, he gives the negociator a ba&s;ket, which is the token of refu&s;al and nothing more is &s;aid, the whole &s;uite return as they came; but if the fa|ther accepts the propo&s;al, the negociator &s;ettles the kalym or price to be paid, which is attended with more difficulty than among the Ea&s;tjaiks, for &s;uch &s;hall be the covetou&s;ne&s;s of the father, that he will keep the whole train a long time on their &s;ledges, that he may get as much for his daughter as he can. The kalym generally con&s;i&s;ts in a variety of clothes, hou&s;hold nece&s;&s;aries, rein-deer, and little matters purcha&s;ed from the Ru&s;&s;ians. The father indeed can keep but part of this kalym to him|&s;elf, it being u&s;ual to give &s;ome of it to his re|lations.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the youth has paid the kalym, the father-in-law loads him and his company with rein-deer meat, and during the fea&s;t, the young man and the bride's father &s;ing to each other, the father advi&s;ing in his &s;ong the &s;on to love his wife, and the &s;on recommending him&s;elf as well as he can to his new father. It is then &s;ettled, when the bride's portion is to be paid, and when the bride &s;hall be ready to give her hand. For a father always gives with his daughter in marriage, a certain quantity of clothes. On the day appointed, the bridegroom
<PB N="13" REF="14">
waits on his bride with a number of &s;trange wo|men to fetch her. On this occa&s;ion, &s;mall pre&s;ents are demanded from tho&s;e relations that &s;hare the kalym. The bride is then forcibly placed on a &s;ledge by the&s;e women, tied on, and all the &s;ledges with the pre&s;ents and gifts (the fir&s;t three or four of which, the father mu&s;t cover with good cloth, and the re&s;t with rein-deer &s;kins) then &s;et off; the bride's &s;ledge fir&s;t, and all the re&s;t following, and return to the young man's hut, where it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the bride to make his bed, in which &s;he &s;leeps by her hu&s;band, but undi&s;turbed for the fir&s;t month. Both Ea&s;tjaiks and Samojedes make the bride's mo|ther a pre&s;ent, if it turns out that her daughter when married, was a virgin.</P>
<P>Some time after marriage, the young wife pays a vi&s;it to her father, and &s;tays with him a few weeks, during which time, &s;he has the liberty to receive her hu&s;band. At their taking leave, the father mu&s;t make her a number of pre&s;ents, and do the &s;ame at every vi&s;it; &s;o that the young wo|man for a length of time &s;hall have no occa&s;ion to apply to her hu&s;band for any thing. In ca&s;es of divorce, the kalym is returned. Should the woman die &s;oon after her marriage, the widower claims a return of the kalym, if re&s;pect to the decea&s;ed does not prevent it.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">The Samojedes have very ea&s;y labours. The af|ter-birth is either buried, or placed in &s;ome remote place, where no cattle, or wild animal, can approach it. At the time of a woman's delivery, her hu&s;|band keeps a good knife ready, with which the attendant on the mother cuts the navel-&s;tring of the child, and keeps the knife as a reward. All pre&s;ent take the child as &s;oon as born, and care&s;s it. Like the Ea&s;tjaiks, they lay it upon rotten wood or &s;oft mo&s;s, and &s;o tie it, that the mother may readily carry it at her back.</P>
<P>When a boy is two years old, his father gives him a name, which he keeps till he is fifteen, then gives him another of his own chu&s;ing, or borrows one from &s;ome friend, after the death of their re|lations; for the names are &s;acredly kept in the family, and &s;hould a Samojede give his &s;on the name of another per&s;on, without the con&s;ent of that per&s;on's relations, it would expo&s;e him to blood&s;hed. A girl never has any money. When married, her hu&s;band calls her Ne, that is, <HI>wife;</HI> and &s;he calls her hu&s;band, Cho&s;owa; that is, <HI>man.</HI></P>
<P>The names generally given to boys, have &s;ome &s;ignificant meaning, as for example: <HI>Chanchara,</HI> &s;ledges and larchwood; <HI>Nerme,</HI> opening in the ice; <HI>Laat&s;cha,</HI> hillock; <HI>Lakeer,</HI> hilly-land; <HI>Naemale,</HI> broken bones; <HI>Warpts,</HI> light-headed; <HI>Eptukai,</HI> goo&s;e foot; and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">The Samojedes inter their dead very &s;oon, have no certain burial-ground, but carry the corp&s;e to a height or hill. They dre&s;s the body in as many of its new clothes as they can put on, laying what is left about the corp&s;e, and put the head into a boiler, from an opinion that, after the head is de|cayed, the &s;oul will there remain: all this done, they wrap up the body in the cover of a tent, of rein-deer &s;kins, bind it round with ropes, and drag it out of the tent, head-foremo&s;t; not out at the door, but from under the covering of the tent the man inhabited, which they rai&s;e for the purpo&s;e; for they idly think, if it is taken through the door, the decea&s;ed will return, and &s;oon fetch away &s;ome other of the family. When brought to the place of interment, if in &s;ummer-time, they dig a very &s;hallow pit, not above eighteen inches deep, cover the corp&s;e with wild bu&s;hes, and then throw the ground upon it. In winter-time, they erect a hut with timber and bu&s;hes, place the decea&s;ed in it, give him an axe, knife, bow and arrows, tobacco, a pipe, &s;poon and cups, and then leave him. The rein-deer that drew the corp&s;e are killed, and put, with all their furniture, into the grave. Rich people kill al&s;o tho&s;e rein-deer with which the decea&s;ed u&s;ed to hunt, and the whole, in winter, is covered with &s;traw; in &s;ummer, with mo&s;s and &s;traw. Of cour&s;e, Samojede graves are a banquet prepared for ice-foxes, hyenas, and other wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">During the interment, they &s;end for a magician, who is often fetched from a great di&s;tance, in ho|nour of the decea&s;ed. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, the&s;e ma|gicians have recour&s;e to the drum, and put on a par|ticular kind of robe, ornamented with figures, in iron-plates. Their bu&s;ine&s;s is, to per&s;wade the &s;pirit of the dead not to mole&s;t tho&s;e he has left behind him, nor fetch them away; but to leave his lucky hunting-days to his relations. At the&s;e times, they &s;acrifice a rein-deer, and dre&s;s it on the &s;pot; but neither the wife nor hu&s;band of the decea&s;ed is at liberty to eat out of the common boiler, without being fir&s;t purified by wa&s;hing and &s;moking them|&s;elves with ca&s;tor. Should a Samojede pa&s;s the grave of an ear relation, even ten years afterwards, he mu&s;t &s;acrifice a rein-deer, in memory of the decea&s;ed, and eat it with his attendants, leaving the head and horns upon the grave. The name of the decea&s;ed is no more to be mentioned, but by allu&s;ion or circumlocution; he that would pronounce the name, would become a declared enemy of the relations: but, after a length of time, the &s;ame name may be revived in the &s;econd or third generation, and given to children, to keep up its remembrance.</P>
<P>Mourning for the dead, con&s;i&s;ts in not tying up their fur-boots, nor girding their bodies with wil|lows; undoing the tre&s;&s;es of the hair, letting it go di&s;hevelled for &s;ome time, and afterwards braiding it,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
for life, into three tre&s;&s;es, letting the third hang on one &s;ide over the ear.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit to mention, that many Samojedes, e&s;pecially magicians, are occa&s;ionally panic-&s;truck, partly owing to lax fibres, the effects of a northern climate, and their manner of living, and partly to fancy, weakened by &s;uper&s;tition.

Major I&s;lenief a&s;&s;ured me, he had heard this among the Jakutes; and, in a le&s;s degree, I met with it among the Tartars, about the Jeni&s;ei, and the Bu&s;cats.&mdash;We have read of the &s;ame among the Laplanders. An unexpected touch, a &s;udden call, whi&s;tling, or a fearful and &s;udden ap|pearance will throw the&s;e people into a &s;tate of fury. The Samojedes, and Jakutes, who &s;eem more to be affected in this way, carry the matter &s;o far, that, forgetting what they are about, they will take the fir&s;t axe, knife, or other offen&s;ive weapon that lies in their way, and would wound or kill the object of their terror, if not prevented by force, and the weapon taken from them; and if &s;o interrupted, will beat them&s;elves about the hands and feet, &s;cream out, roll upon the ground and rave. The Samo|jedes and Ea&s;tjaiks have an infallible remedy to bring &s;uch per&s;ons to them&s;elves; which is, to &s;et fire to a rein-deer &s;kin, or a &s;ack of rein-deer hair, and let it &s;moke under the patient's no&s;e: this oc|ca&s;ions

<P>In the di&s;trict of the river Ob, Mr. <HI>Surjef</HI> &s;aw a fe|male magician, who had quitted her way of life, on account of her advanced age. This woman was not only terrified by whi&s;tling, but even by the noi&s;e of the wind. There was al&s;o, among the Samojedes who ac|companied him on his journey to the frozen &s;ea, a woman, who was terribly frightened at every trifle. In 1772, in their travels through Manga&s;ei, they met with a young Samojede &s;orcerer, whom Mr. <HI>Surjef</HI> no &s;ooner approached, than he imagined he was going to be killed; and, on holding a finger out to him, he &s;eized it with both hands, and took that opportunity to run off: however, after many per&s;wa&s;ions of the interpre|ter, that no harm was de&s;igned him, he recovered him|&s;elf. They then put on him a black glove, and imme|diately his eyes rolled; he &s;tared &s;tedfa&s;tly at the glove, and fell into &s;uch a fit of madne&s;s, that he would have committed &s;ome murder, with an axe that lay in his way, had it not been &s;ecured. Di&s;appointed of his weapon, he ran about raving, &s;creaming, and &s;haking his hand, in order to get off the glove, which he took to be the claw of a bear, and which he was afraid to touch with the other hand, till the bye-&s;tanders laid hold of him forcibly, and pulled it off, on which he recovered.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">The Samojede magicians are &s;kilfull in their art: be&s;ides the drum, which they u&s;e as do the Lapland|ers, they wear a particular dre&s;s. According to Mr. <HI>Gmelin</HI>'s account, they are tolerable jugglers. Some have the art of plunging a knife into the body, without making a wound; and apparently wringing off their heads, by fa&s;tening a cord round their necks, and &s;uf|fering two per&s;ons to draw it tight, and afterwards &s;et|ting it on again. But the&s;e tricks are &s;een only among tho&s;e magicians who require but little art to deceive their countrymen; and, indeed, to &s;peak &s;eriou&s;ly, &s;uch a Siberian juggler, would cut but a very indifferent figure at a European fair.</P>
<P>I could learn nothing authentic about their idols; yet I know that each man has, in his hou&s;e, a pagod, which is often &s;ome particular &s;tone, or &s;ome other in|animate body, which the Samojede ties upon his &s;ledge, and con&s;iders as &s;acred.</P>
<P>I will &s;ay a few words about their amu&s;ements, and then leave them. When many a&s;&s;emble, upon any joyous occa&s;ion, they divert them&s;elves with fighting, and running over certain limits. They al&s;o dance with their wives, by couples, in circles; throw them|&s;elves into a variety of attitudes, and make a number of grimaces, all to mu&s;ical mea&s;ure; and often, for want of mu&s;ic, will keep time by &s;norting, and other

<P><HI>Tooke,</HI> who &s;peaks from <HI>Gmelin,</HI> is a little more particular re&s;pecting the per&s;ons of the Samojedes. He &s;ays, <Q>The men are about five feet high; &s;ome few are &s;een, only four feet. They &s;eem all of a heap; have &s;hort legs, &s;mall neck, a large head, flat no&s;e and face, with the lower part of the face projecting outwards, large mouth and ears, &s;mall black eyes, but wide eye-lids, &s;mall lips, and little feet; their &s;kin is of a deepi&s;h yellow hue, and they have &s;eldom any beard at all; their hair grows in very &s;mall quan|tity, but, &s;mall as it is, both &s;exes take great pains to eradicate it every where, except on their heads, where it is black, and has the appearance of &s;ilk. The women are &s;horter than the men; have a more &s;len|der &s;hape, and are &s;ofter in their features. At the &s;ame time, they are far from hand&s;ome; and a pretty female is as extraordinary as a fine man; their brea&s;ts are &s;mall and flat, and their maturity very early; many of them being mothers at twelve years of age, and &s;ometimes at eleven: they are not, however, very prolific; and, after thirty years of age, &s;eldom bear children.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22"><Q>The con&s;titution of this country has always been, and &s;till is, that of the infancy of the world.

<P>Having now de&s;cribed the per&s;ons of the Samojedes, let us &s;peak of their fi&s;heries, and manner of hunting, in and about the river Ob; in which the Ea&s;tjaiks and Samojedes agree.</P>
<P>There is no large river in all Ru&s;&s;ia and Siberia, where &s;uch a quantity of all kind of fi&s;h of pa&s;&s;age comes up from the &s;ea, as in the Ob Of whitings <HI>(Coregoni),</HI> it contains &s;everal unknown &s;pecies; but trout, &s;almon, and &s;everal other &s;orts of fi&s;h, caught in other large rivers of Ru&s;&s;ia and Siberia, are wanting
<PB N="22" REF="23">
here; which may be a&s;cribed to the nature of the water, its &s;low cour&s;e, and the &s;limine&s;s of the ground. The Siberian omul <HI>(Salmo autumnalis),</HI> found in the Jeni&s;ei, Angara, Baikal, Tubal; and the lake Mad|&s;hour, is not &s;een here, though it is common in the frozen &s;ea; nor is the little trout <HI>(Salmo eriox),</HI> abun|dantly caught on the Jugrian coa&s;t, and on the river Pet&s;chora, to be found in the river Ob; but the &s;tur|geon, and hu&s;o, who like a &s;oft ground, are larger, and more abundant, yet of a wor&s;e ta&s;te in the Ob, than in &s;uch rivers as are &s;tony.</P>
<P>The fi&s;hes of pa&s;&s;age peculiar to the Ob, and &s;een no where el&s;e, are, the muk&s;un <HI>(Salmo lavareto affinis),</HI> the &s;oroch <HI>(Salmo wimba),</HI> the nelma, large quabs, pike, perch, &s;had, and barbel. The muk&s;un, nelma, and &s;ome others, crowd up the Ob in &s;pring, as &s;oon as the ice is di&s;&s;olved, reach Bere&s;owa about June, and then proceed further into the Jeni&s;ei and Tom; but, in September, chiefly return into the ocean, before the river-water, under the ice, begins to &s;tink. This di&s;|agreeable change of water, only happens in little, &s;low-flowing rivers; not in the larger ones, in the di&s;trict of Bere&s;owa, nor even in the Ob, after the month of December. Some rivers, which flow from the moun|tains into the Ob, and have &s;trong and rapid &s;treams, as the Sob, and others, are free from this defect; and, of cour&s;e, are fuller of fi&s;h in winter-time. But, in the Ob, fi&s;h commonly live in &s;uch places, where the &s;weet
<PB N="23" REF="24">
water rivers empty them&s;elves, and where fre&s;h and &s;trong rivulets run into it. In &s;uch places, the finny tribes a&s;&s;emble &s;o plenteou&s;ly, that they are caught, in quantities, during the whole winter. Where there is foul or dead water, it does not fre&s;hen and be|come &s;weet till &s;pring, when the melted &s;nows adds to it.</P>
<P>The &s;pring-fi&s;hery in the Ob does not begin before June; when the river opens again, and &s;hoals of fi&s;h pu&s;h their way up, and fill all its branches. Ju&s;t at this period, the Ob is too deep and broad to be fi&s;hed; and, it has been known that at &s;uch flood-times as happened in 1770 and 1771, the Ea&s;tjaiks, who have made no provi&s;ion, have been almo&s;t &s;tarved. Tho&s;e who are prudent, make a greater provi&s;ion than merely for the winter; and find them&s;elves very well rewarded for their care.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides drag-nets, made u&s;e of from June to October, the Ea&s;tjaiks have Various, other ways of fi&s;hing. One is, with a net, called <HI>Kylidan.</HI> It is like a bag, ten feet broad, and &s;even long: its lower edge is &s;tretched upon a pole, at the middle of which a &s;tone is fixed, in order to &s;ink it, flat on the ground. Near the &s;tone is fa&s;tened a rope, which goes through a ring fa&s;tened on the upper edge of the net, which the fi&s;herman row|ing takes hold of, and drags the net after him. A few inches below the upper edge of the net, are &s;ome
<PB N="24" REF="25">
&s;trings fa&s;tened to it, which the man holds between his fingers, and hereby feels when any large fi&s;h &s;trikes again&s;t the net; when he immediately lets go the &s;tring, and pulls the rope tight, which draws the bottom and top of the net together, and impri&s;ons all that is with|in the bag. With the&s;e nets they catch, from June to September, &s;turgeon, white &s;almon, quab, muk&s;un, and &s;chagur.</P>
<P>Through the &s;ummer, they al&s;o catch a quantity of fi&s;h, with garths and ba&s;kets; and al&s;o, in winter, when the ice is &s;olid; and they u&s;e ropes, with hooks on them, called &s;na&s;ts, as in the Wolga. They fi&s;h, at night, with fi&s;h-prongs, in the &s;ide-rivers, by the light of kindled birch-bark, erected upon poles; and, when the rivers are &s;hut up, will make openings, with huts over them, and let down baits, cut out in wood, and made to re&s;emble &s;mall fi&s;hes; in doing which they are cle|ver, and, when the&s;e baits draw fi&s;hes towards them, catch them with their prongs. Such a quantity of &s;turgeon is caught at Bere&s;owa, that a pud weight will not &s;ell for more than 40 copecs, and the fat at 50, per pud; and never for more than a ruble.</P>
<P>There is a kind of dolphin met with in the gulph of the river Ob, and is occa&s;ionally &s;een at certain di&s;|tances up the river, in pur&s;uit of fi&s;hes of pa&s;&s;age. The&s;e are the fi&s;h, which the Ru&s;&s;ians call Bjelugas; which Mr. <HI>Gmelin</HI> has given &s;ome account of; and
<PB N="25" REF="26">
which are mentioned by <HI>Muller;</HI> and al&s;o, by Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Kra&s;chenini,</HI> in his natural hi&s;tory of Kam&s;chatka. <HI>An|der&s;on</HI> and <HI>Crantz,</HI> in their accounts of Greenland, give a particular de&s;cription of this dolphin, which they call the White Dolphin; and what they &s;ay of its teeth, corre&s;ponds with what I have my&s;elf ob&s;erved in the head of this fi&s;h. Nothing is more true, than the &s;up|po&s;itions in <HI>Muller</HI>'s Collection; that the &s;ea bjeluga, is no other than the white dolphin of the Greenlanders. Mr. <HI>Surjef,</HI> four miles beyond Obdor&s;kaja, found &s;everal heads of this fi&s;h, in a pagan place of &s;acrifice. From a variety of accounts, which I have collected from tho&s;e who are well acquainted with the &s;ea-bjeluga, and from a head which I received quite entire, I am capable of re&s;olving every doubt re&s;pecting this animal; and I take upon me to aver, that this marine bjeluga belongs to the genus of dolphins; having, like the whale, two heart-pits, lungs, warm blood, external genital parts, and teats; and that it cannot have any communication with the bjeluga of the Ca&s;pian, and Black &s;eas; nor have any &s;imilarity to it, but in the name, form, and white colour. The white dolphin re&s;embles a qua|druped &s;o much, particularly the &s;ea-dog, that the Samojedes take it rather for a water-animal, than a fi&s;h. It is never above 21 feet in length; its head is oblong; and, in re&s;pect to the body, very &s;mall, conically flat above, and about the &s;nout obtu&s;e, &s;oft, and round. It's eyes are &s;mall, round, and project from the head. It has no no&s;trils in the &s;nout, but has a vent-hole in
<PB N="26" REF="27">
the forehead, through which, when it &s;wims on the top of the water, it throws up a great deal of water, as a &s;pout. Its ear-holes are very di&s;tingui&s;hable; its mouth, with the lips, not much wider than a rein-deer, which, if it wants to bite, it can open wide, and both jaws have, on each &s;ide, a row of &s;hort, and very blunt, teeth. The di&s;tingui&s;hable mark of this fi&s;h, from all other of its genus, is, that it has no gills. When it &s;wims, it bends its tail like a crab, beats the water impetuou&s;ly back, and thus darts forward, as rapid as an arrow. Its &s;kin is white, moi&s;t, without hair, as &s;oft as human &s;kin. Underneath its belly, the female genitals are very vi&s;ible, and clo&s;e by are two teats, like tho&s;e of a cow, full of white milk. The penis of the male is about ten inches long, without cartilage or bone, thick as one's arm, and pointed at the end like that of a bul|lock. The Samojedes &s;ay, its fle&s;h is as black as &s;oot; and the whole body is covered with a white &s;ward: the young ones are more black, or grey, than the mother, and follow her &s;wimming. In general, white dolphins gather, in little flocks, together; and when they are ob&s;erved in the gulph of the Ob, the Samojedes a&s;&s;em|ble, in large numbers, drive them on the &s;hallows, and kill them. Dr. <HI>Baden,</HI> re&s;ident-phy&s;ician of the re|gency of Tobol&s;koi, di&s;&s;ected one, and compares its inte&s;tines to tho&s;e of a calf.</P>
<P>Hunting is very general in all the di&s;tricts &s;ituated north of Bere&s;owa. The animals that abound mo&s;t in
<PB N="27" REF="28">
the woodle&s;s wilds, the farthe&s;t north, are blue and white ice-foxes, common foxes, white and grey wolves, hyenas, and rein-deer. In the adjacent, woody parts, elks, lynxes, &s;ables, ermines, otters, beavers, and a few black bears; and, on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, white bears, but not &s;o abundant as on the ice-fields of the ocean. About Obdor&s;kaja, they are very rare; but not &s;o rare about the Jeni&s;ei, as far as Manga&s;ei. It having been ob&s;erved, that ice-foxes follow the mice, in certain years, to ea&s;tward; they are at &s;uch times found, in great quantities, in Manga&s;ei; and the hunting then has not been &s;o good upon the Ob.</P>
<P>Their methods of catching the&s;e animals, are the &s;ame as tho&s;e practi&s;ed in Ru&s;&s;ia and Siberia. Be&s;ides &s;hooting-in&s;truments, and catch-clefts, they have &s;elf-&s;hooting bows, for bears, lynxes, wolves, hyenas, and the common game. Wolves and foxes are caught with poi&s;onous baits of crow's-eyes and &s;ublimate; and, by fall-traps. Of the latter, the Ea&s;tjaiks make a kind, which they call <HI>Kurom&s;e&s;s,</HI> &s;et up with a block, on which the bait is tied; and the animal endeavouring to move the block, to take off the bait, is killed by its fall. Such traps as are u&s;ed in Ru&s;&s;ia, for ermines and pole-cats, are made u&s;e of by the Samojedes, but of a larger &s;ize for ice-foxes; and &s;ometimes they fix &s;elf-&s;hooting bows, on forks, in the deep &s;now, again&s;t &s;now-hills, in which &s;uch foxes hide pieces of fi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">Sables are of little value here; and are either &s;hot by the pea&s;ants with arrows, or driven into nets. If found &s;leeping in their holes, a bag-net is placed before them, into which the &s;able is driven, and en|tangled.</P>
<P>Beavers are &s;ometimes &s;een in crowds, about the un|inhabited di&s;tricts of the rivers; but, in general, are &s;ound &s;ingle, in woody borders. Hunters go in &s;earch of their holes in winter; and, having found them, en|compa&s;s them with pales on the water-&s;ide; then open the vent-hole, large enough to let a dog in, who takes the beaver by the teeth, and he is then drawn out by the hunter, by the hind-legs. Others are pur&s;ued and killed, &s;ometimes by dogs, and &s;ometimes by &s;pring|bows, placed by the water-&s;ide, that go off and &s;hoot the animal, when the bait fixed on it is touched. They encompa&s;s woody places with pales, leaving here and there a way out, and fix &s;nares, and &s;pring-bows, at &s;uch openings. They catch elks, and rein-deer, by the &s;ame method; but in the mar&s;hy plains, near the &s;ea, where this cannot be done &s;ucce&s;sfully, the Samojedes have found out another method of getting at the wild rein-deer, who rove there in winter, in herds of ten, a hundred, and two hundred at a time. When there are many Samojedes together, and they &s;ee &s;uch a herd of wild rein-deer, they place &s;ome tame ones, and &s;ledges, at a di&s;tance, upon a piece of flat, high land, to windward, and &s;tick from thence in the &s;now,
<PB N="29" REF="30">
towards the herd, long &s;ticks, with goo&s;e-wings tied on them; and which the rein-deer ea&s;ily move, at the di&s;tance of ten fathoms from each other: and, on the other &s;ide, to leeward, or under the wind, about 50 fa|thoms from the &s;ledges, they &s;tick poles as before, and continue them on till they have pa&s;&s;ed the herd, which are all this time &s;earching for food underneath the &s;now, too attentive to look about, and prevented from that by their great beams. When all is ready, the Samo|jedes divide; part hide them&s;elves behind the &s;ledges, and part, called <HI>Wardar,</HI> lie concealed, with bows and ar|rows, in the opening on the lee-&s;ide, near the &s;ledges; others, at the &s;ame time, run, and drive the herd towards the winged poles, which, &s;haking in the wind, alarms them, and, impelled by fear, they run among the tame rein-deer &s;tanding by the &s;ledges. They are &s;oon, however, driven from this place; and, &s;eeing no winged poles where the Wardar lie, attempt to force their way through, and there many of them meet their death. But as &s;uch a mode of hunting requires a great number of people, they have other inventions, to de|ceive the rein-deer. Having trained up four or five of their tame, female rein-deer, &s;o as to walk in order with the hunt&s;man, he fa&s;tens a long cord about each of their horns, and ties the other end to his girdle, that he may have the command of them, in ca&s;e of confu|&s;ion, or di&s;appointment. The&s;e female rein-deer have the fawns running about them; the hunter is thus &s;ur|rounded by the whole, and, with this cavalcade, can
<PB N="30" REF="31">
approach the wild deer, near enough to &s;hoot the one he likes.</P>
<P>In autumn, at rutting-time, the Samojedes will take a &s;trong buck, and go with it in &s;earch of wild herds; and, meeting one, will wind a cord about the buck's beams, or horns, extending it from one horn to the other, and there fa&s;ten it: &s;o armed, he is turned loo&s;e. The hot animal ru&s;hes among the herd, and is there attacked by the wild buck, who, during the conte&s;t, is entangled by the horns, in the ropes fa&s;tened about tho&s;e of the tame one; when the hunt&s;man runs in, and kills him. They catch their deer al&s;o with great ea&s;e, when they come down, in &s;ummer, to the cool brooks; and, in winter-time, in deep &s;nows, by pur&s;uing them in their &s;now-&s;cates.</P>
<P>When on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, the Samojedes employ them|&s;elves in catching &s;eals, or &s;ea-calves, that prowl about the cliffs, or ice; and &s;ea-dogs, that come up from the water, through &s;mall holes which they make in the ice, by con&s;tantly lying on one &s;pot. The Samojedes lay a board near &s;uch holes, to which they fa&s;ten a rope, and hiding them&s;elves behind the large pieces of ice, till the &s;eal comes up out of the water through the hole, they draw the board over the hole, which prevents its return, and of cour&s;e it is &s;oon killed. (See plate Samojedes.)</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32">Having de&s;cribed their fi&s;hing and hunting, I mu&s;t not omit their fowling, which begins in &s;pring, in the di&s;trict of the river Ob. As the &s;now melts, they look out for &s;uch &s;pots, where the &s;now-water forms little lakes. As the fowls arrive, with the fir&s;t thaw, and &s;ettle in &s;uch lakes, they erect &s;mall huts near them, where they can lie concealed, and within reach of a &s;hot; and, in order to decoy gee&s;e and ducks, they &s;tuff out the &s;kins of gee&s;e and ducks with hay, and fix them near this hut; and it is curious to &s;ee how wild &s;wans and gee&s;e will &s;oar over the&s;e &s;tuffed baits, and unfeather them with their bills.</P>
<P>Later in &s;pring, they catch them in flying-nets, hung up in an avenue made through a wood, as I have al|ready de&s;cribed el&s;ewhere: nay, they catch them here in broad day, as the fowlers conceal them&s;elves in huts, erected for the purpo&s;e. They catch wild gee&s;e, al&s;o, on the flat &s;and-banks, with &s;uch a net as fowlers u&s;e in England, to catch &s;mall birds; for in the&s;e northern countries, the people take no notice of &s;mall water-fowl, they catch only the larger kind; and the quan|tity here is &s;o great, that the Ru&s;&s;ian inhabitants might provide them&s;elves well with it for the whole year, and have plenty to throw away in the en&s;uing &s;pring, which brings fre&s;h &s;upplies.</P>
<P>I came back to Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja to winter, on the 28th of February, 1772; Mr. <HI>Georgi,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tant to Profe&s;&s;or

This road is tolerably pa&s;&s;able; &s;ometimes we travelled on &s;ledges, and &s;ometimes on waggons.

That I might mi&s;s nothing worthy notice, or ob&s;ervation, I left Mr. <HI>Ka&s;chkaref</HI> at Kra&s;nojar&s;k, to explore the ve|getable kingdom, in the neighbouring mountains, as the &s;pring opened; and &s;ent Mr. <HI>Surjef,</HI> as he was more accu&s;tomed to travelling in the north, to Jeni&s;eikaja, and from thence, by water, to Manga&s;ei, and further northwards, to get all the knowledge he could of the Siberian productions in the frigid zone.</P>
<P>We reached the town Irkuzkaja on the 14th at eleven at night; our hor&s;es being very much fatigued. The
<PB N="33" REF="34">
many curio&s;ities I had here to &s;ee, the many u&s;eful accounts I had to collect, re&s;pecting the unknown di|&s;trict on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Baikal; and the kind attention of his excellency Lieutenant-general <HI>De Brill,</HI> governor of this town, &s;o engro&s;&s;ed my time for the whole week I &s;taid, that I could not think of giving a de&s;cription of this fine place; of cour&s;e, left it to the pen of Mr. <HI>Georgi,</HI> who was to &s;tay here till the ice left the Baikal, which would at lea&s;t be two months longer; fir&s;t giving him my in&s;tructions, to guide him in the journey he was to take, along the coa&s;ts of that &s;ea.</P>
<P>Through the favour of General <HI>Brill,</HI> I &s;hared an uncommon curio&s;ity, which richly de&s;erves mentioning. During the winter, the inhabitants of this town, being out a hunting, found, on the river Wilui, the body of an unknown, large animal, and brought the head of it, with a fore and hind foot, well pre&s;erved, to this place. The per&s;on who &s;ent it and the annexed account, dates his letter, Jan. 17, 1772; and mentions, that the car|ca&s;e of the animal had been found in December, about 30 miles up the river, on the &s;andy borders, about 7 feet from the water, and 28 feet from a higher and &s;teeper border, half-covered with &s;and; that it was mea&s;ured on the &s;pot, and found to be 7&frac12; feet long, and its height 5 feet. The whole body had &s;till its natural, thick, leather &s;kin, but had been &s;o decayed, that nothing could be taken off whole, but the head
<PB N="34" REF="35">
and feet, which he had &s;ent to Irkuzkaja, as a curi|o&s;ity. On the fir&s;t appearance, the&s;e parts &s;hewed, that they belonged to a rhinoceros. The head was &s;till covered with its natural &s;kin; and, therefore, the more di&s;tingui&s;hable. On the &s;kin was, on one &s;ide, &s;hort hairs; and, almo&s;t every where, the external organiza|tion of the &s;kin was well pre&s;erved; even the eye-lids did not appear to be decayed. Underneath the &s;kin lay, here and there, a loamy &s;ub&s;tance, the remnant of &s;ome decayed, &s;oft parts. About the feet were, be|&s;ides the &s;kin, &s;trong remains of joints and &s;inews. The horn of the mouth, and the hoofs of the feet, were wanting; but the &s;ituation of the former, and the border of the &s;kin round it, were like the cloven hind and fore-foot&mdash;unque&s;tionable marks of this animal.</P>
<P>Having written a &s;pecial treati&s;e on this wonderful di&s;covery, which may be found in the writings of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, I &s;hall not repeat the cau&s;e, that may have brought &s;uch an animal to the mo&s;t northern di&s;tricts of the Lena; and &s;o many other remains of &s;trange animals, all over Siberia. I &s;hall only mention &s;ome circum&s;tances which occurred to me, and acquaint the reader with the di&s;trict where the&s;e remains were found, and pre&s;erved for &s;uch a length of time. The country about the Wilui is mountain|ous, and contains either &s;trata of &s;and, or limy &s;lates, with &s;ome &s;oft layers of loam. Upon the banks are
<PB N="35" REF="36">
al&s;o broken &s;tone-coal; of which there mu&s;t be &s;ome bed, higher up the Wilui. The brook Kemtendoi, on which is a whole mountain of &s;elenites, and rock|&s;alt, in the neighbourhood of an alaba&s;ter mountain, lies 225 miles higher up the Wilui, from the &s;pot where the rhinoceros was di&s;covered. Right towards that &s;pot lies, upon the Wilui, a &s;andy mountain, who&s;e height is near 15 fathoms; near which the body of the animal was found, tolerably deep in gravel, and was pre&s;erved by the fro&s;t, as the ground never thaws about the Wilui, to a con&s;iderable depth. The warme&s;t, &s;andy, and elevated tracts, are indeed &s;oftened by the rays of the &s;un, to the di&s;tance of &s;ome feet under|ground; but in the vallies, where the earth is mixed with loam and &s;and, we find, even at the end of the &s;ummer, every thing freezes, at a foot deep. But for this, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible that the animal &s;hould have been &s;o far pre&s;erved, who&s;e tran&s;po&s;ition from a &s;outhern, native &s;oil, into the frigid zone, can|not be of later date than the general deluge; as the olde&s;t annals of men &s;peak of no later change of the earth; and to this change, may probably be a&s;cribed this variety of contents in the earth; the remains of the rhinoceros, and the bones of elephants, di&s;per&s;ed throughout Siberia.</P>
<P>On account of the warm weather, we &s;aw now, about Irkuzkaja, the la&s;t pa&s;&s;age of the &s;now-larks <HI>(Alauda alpe&s;tris),</HI> and black &s;parrows <HI>(Fringilla flavi-ro&s;tris);</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="37">
and there was al&s;o arriving, a kind of parti-coloured jackdaw, which &s;pends the winter in China, or the warmer part of the &s;tates of the Mogul <HI>(Corvus Dau|ricus).</HI></P>
<P>The winter-road we were to travel, was over the fro|zen lakes, and &s;hore of the Baikal; and, in our way, on the 23d of March, a mo&s;t violent, frigid &s;torm blew behind us, &s;o that the &s;ledge-leaders could not keep their ground, but were blown many fathoms about the &s;ledge, on the &s;lippery ice; and nothing could fix them, or &s;ave them from the danger of being blown into the deep chinks between the ice, and being frozen to death, but &s;ticking their knives into the ice, and holding fa&s;t by them. The&s;e chinks are, in many places, &s;o large, and &s;o deep, that no one dur&s;t venture to cro&s;s the ice in &s;uch weather. As the &s;torm increa&s;ed, we were obliged to halt, and take up our abode in this cold &s;pot, till the next day, not daring to cro&s;s the lake before us. Several per&s;ons were here, preparing to catch &s;ea-dogs, which prowl up from the Baikal, to the&s;e warmer places, to &s;leep, ba&s;k in the &s;un-&s;hine, and en|joy them&s;elves. They come up to the&s;e animals, rea|dily, in little &s;ledges; before which they extend a white &s;ail, which the &s;ea-dogs take for a piece of ice, and are thus &s;urrounded, and &s;hot with balls. There is gene|rally a beaten road over the&s;e lakes, and the &s;ea-coa&s;t, in winter; and men will travel it, in preference to one that is le&s;s dangerous, but farther round: nay, will even
<PB N="37" REF="38">
pa&s;s chinks, by putting boards acro&s;s; over which the hor&s;es and &s;ledges will pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Approaching nearer the &s;hore of the Baikal, I &s;aw a particular kind of fi&s;hing-ba&s;ket, con&s;i&s;ting of a little enclo&s;ure of bu&s;hes, extending from the &s;hore &s;ome feet into the water; at the end of which was another en|clo&s;ure, that formed two rooms; who&s;e entrance is the angle which each room forms with the enclo&s;ure. When any fi&s;h approaches the enclo&s;ure, they go into the&s;e rooms, or places, from which they cannot return. Here I &s;topped, to put one of my waggons upon wheels, for they were &s;o contrived as occa&s;ionally to be converted into &s;ledges, for the purpo&s;e of travel|ing over the ice and &s;now. We travelled on, at the rate of about 25 miles a day, but with difficulty; &s;ome|times on &s;ledges, &s;ometimes on wheels, but without any material accident; pa&s;&s;ing many villages in our way, till we reached the town of Selengin&s;kaja, on the 31&s;t of March, where I met Mr. <HI>Sokalof,</HI> whom I had &s;ent forward in the beginning of the year.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict about this place is encompa&s;&s;ed by &s;andy mountains; and &s;o warm, that &s;pring begins here &s;ooner than in the mountains about the Baikal. On the 20th of February, the air was very temperate; and, towards the end of this month, the &s;now melted en|tirely upon the hills; and all &s;orts of birds of pa&s;&s;age were arriving. On the 20th of March I &s;hot the fir&s;t
<PB N="38" REF="39">
water-wagtail; and a great many little birds now en|tered the woods.</P>
<P>On the 3d of April, the &s;now being entirely melted, I made a little tour, to the di&s;tance of 60 miles, up the brook T&s;chikoi, to &s;ee the Mongalian pagoda that was erected here about 12 years ago. I cho&s;e this time, being informed, that the three days of prayer, ap|pointed monthly by the Mongols and Burats, are on the 13th, 14th, and 15th days of the new moon; &s;o that I might &s;ee here the idolatry of the Lamas, and compare it with that of the Kalmucks. I reached it on the 5th of April. This pagoda is &s;ituated in a &s;andy plain, and is the large&s;t belonging to the Ru&s;&s;ian Mon|gols. Be&s;ides the chief pagoda, and &s;ix &s;maller ones, there is here erected a good man&s;ion, belonging to the chief of the clergy of Lama in this di&s;trict, whom they call <HI>Bandidi-Chambo-Lama;</HI> and two hou&s;es, one inha|bited by a military clerk, and the other by a chri&s;tened Mongol, in the &s;ervice of the Co&s;&s;ack regiments. There are al&s;o, about the north, we&s;t, and ea&s;t &s;ides of the pagoda, &s;everal enclo&s;ures, in which the principal clergy, if they come here to the &s;ervice of the temple, erect their felt tents; &s;ome on the ground, and others, on a platform, rai&s;ed with planks above the ground. All the buildings are of wood, and built by Ru&s;&s;ian carpenters, according to the direction of the high|prie&s;t, Chambo-lama; who endeavoured to imitate the form and ornaments of the pagodas of Thibet, which
<PB N="39" REF="40">
he had &s;een in his youth. It would be a &s;uperfluous repetition, to enter here into a circum&s;tantial de&s;crip|tion of the&s;e temples; as I pre&s;erve the&s;e, and other accounts, for a particular treati&s;e on the manners, cu&s;toms, and religion of the Mongols and Kalmucks, which I mean to publi&s;h hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Kjachta.</HI> Twenty-&s;even miles from this place &s;tands Kjachta, which is the frontier fortre&s;s, and centre of all commerce between Ru&s;&s;ia and China; where there is a guard of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, to prevent &s;mug|gling. This place is &s;ituated in an even, elevated plain, in a wide valley, inter&s;ected by the brook Kjachta, and encompa&s;&s;ed with high, rocky, and woody mountains; the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which is called, by the Mon|gols, <HI>Burgultei</HI> (eagle-mountain); it lies &s;o clo&s;e to the fortre&s;s, on the &s;outhern &s;ide, as to command the &s;ame; and yields a fine pro&s;pect in every &s;treet, and part of the fortre&s;s; and al&s;o of the Chine&s;e fortre&s;s, adjoining it. Since the la&s;t marking out of the boun|daries, the Chine&s;e, probably con&s;cious of the advan|tage the mountain may afford, have claimed it as their own; under the frivolous pretence, of its containing &s;ome holy &s;epulchres of their ance&s;tors; for the Ru&s;&s;ian frontier-line formerly ran acro&s;s it. The whole moun|tain, however, is now left with them; and the boun|daries are drawn more to the north, over the bottom. On a we&s;tern and adjacent mountain, &s;tand the Ru&s;&s;ian and Chine&s;e marks of boundary. The former is a heap
<PB N="40" REF="41">
of &s;tones and earth, with a cro&s;s; the latter, of &s;tones only, &s;et up, one on another, &s;o as to leave a hollow place within, &s;omething like a Kalmuck tent, or Tar|tarian jourt.</P>
<P>The fortre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of a quadrangle of palli&s;adoes, fortified on the curtains with four wooden, corner ba|&s;tions, and batteries. It has three gates; one on the northern &s;ide, one on the &s;outh, towards the Chine&s;e frontier-town, which I am going to de&s;cribe; and a third on the we&s;t, on the brook Kjachta. Within the fortre&s;s, is a fine wood-built church with bells, a &s;pa|cious bartering-hou&s;e, with 60 &s;hops, which is to be made &s;till more exten&s;ive, on a new plan, and built of &s;tone; in the centre of which is laid the foundation of a little chapel, which is to be built al&s;o of &s;tone. Here is al&s;o a hou&s;e for the commander, a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, an old guard-hou&s;e, and a great number of offices and hou&s;es belonging to merchants; be&s;ides dwellings for the &s;oldiers. The &s;uburbs which are encompa&s;&s;ed with a wooden wall, have not more than about 120 hou&s;es, very irregularly built; the gates, however&punc; to this place, are guarded, as are the gates of the fortre&s;s.</P>
<P>Kjachta is &s;upplied with nothing &s;o ill as with water; for the brook is, in &s;ummer-time, &s;o &s;hallow, as &s;carce to be above the &s;hoes; and the water &s;o thick, as to be unfit to drink. Many wells have been &s;unk, but
<PB N="41" REF="42">
they are &s;o impregnated with lime, and a bitter &s;alt, that all the inhabitants, who are people of property, and fond of tea, &s;end for water, with leave of the Chi|ne&s;e, to a &s;pring in their territory.</P>
<P>Their &s;oil is equally bad; and con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of &s;and and rocks, quite unfit for gardening. Had the line of boundary been placed a little further, towards China, by a neighbouring brook, as appears to have been marked out by nature, the &s;ituation of this fortre&s;s would have been better; there would have been abund|ance of good water, plenty of fi&s;h, and a fertile plain behind it,&mdash;advantages which the Chine&s;e, at pre&s;ent, enjoy.</P>
<P>The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of a company of &s;oldiers, and a number of Co&s;&s;acks, &s;ettled here. The commander is an officer of rank, who decides all little quarrels and di&s;putes, that ari&s;e among the principal Ru&s;&s;ian and Chine&s;e merchants; and who, in ca&s;es of more im|portance, appeals to a neighbouring court of limits, and the governor of Irkazkaja.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t opulent inhabitants of Kjachta, are Ru&s;&s;ian merchants, and commi&s;&s;ioners of con&s;iderable hou&s;es at Peter&s;burgh, and other Ru&s;&s;ian places of note; and are as civilized and ho&s;pitable as in any town in Si|beria, except Irkazkaja. Their company would &s;till be more plea&s;ing, if they did not trouble &s;trangers with
<PB N="42" REF="43">
&s;o much drinking of tea; for every merchant prides him&s;elf in producing as many &s;amples of boiled tea, as he has in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The boundaries, between the&s;e two countries, are carried on a con&s;iderable way, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, with chevaux-de-frize, which prevents cattle being &s;muggled into either country. Every guard-&s;tation we&s;tward, as far as the regency of Tobol&s;koi, and five other ports ea&s;twards, are &s;ubordinate to the commander of Kjachta; but tho&s;e beyond the mountain, are under the com|mander of A&s;chin&s;kaja. It will not be unu&s;eful, nor unplea&s;ant, to tho&s;e who are fond of geography, to know where the line of partition runs: I will, there|fore, point it out. We&s;twards, from Kjachta, towards the regency of Tobol&s;koi, follow the frontier ports, in the following order:</P>
<P>Ut&s;chin&s;koi-Karaul, 23 miles from Kjachta, upon the Selenga, in an open mountainous di&s;trict.</P>
<P>Zagan-U&s;&s;un&s;koi, five miles from the latter, al&s;o on the river Selenga.</P>
<P>Bo&s;&s;in&s;koi, 19 miles further on the river D&s;hida, which the line follows upwards.</P>
<P>Silturin&s;koi, 23 miles; where, on the right, the brook Silturna falls into the D&s;hida, and the country grows more mountainous.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44">Chuldazkoi, 19 miles further.</P>
<P>Charazan&s;koi, 23 miles; to which are &s;everal roads, and where there are many fields in the vallies, which the villagers on the D&s;hida do not u&s;e. Now the moun|tains become, on the right of the D&s;hida, e&s;pecially towards Mongalia, &s;o very wild and high, that no one can go to the following ports, but on hor&s;eback, and this in &s;ummer only, e&s;pecially in wet weather, with|out danger of their lives.</P>
<P>Ze&s;kin&s;koi, 23 miles from Charazan; where, on the right, the brook Sod&s;ki falls into the D&s;hida.</P>
<P>Modenkol&s;koi, 57 miles; Nat&s;chitun&s;koi, 50 miles, and thence to Doto&s;hin&s;koi, nine miles, a wild di&s;trict; after which follows an unhabitable, impervious &s;now|mountain, between the &s;ources of the D&s;hida and D&s;honmurin, that to a di&s;tance of 150 miles, to Tunkin&s;koi-O&s;trog, between D&s;honmurin and the bay of Baikal, or Kultak, not a place could be found for a frontier-po&s;t; and, from Tunkin&s;koi-O&s;trog, the moun|tain continues &s;o high and &s;teep, as far as to the Jeni&s;ei, that they could place but two guard-&s;tations, in the di&s;tance of 50 miles; and from thence it is 120 miles, to the fir&s;t frontier-po&s;t in the regency of Tobol&s;koi.</P>
<P>Ea&s;twards of Kjachta, the &s;tations are &s;ituated along the T&s;chikoi; the fir&s;t Kiran&s;koi, 12 miles; the
<PB N="44" REF="45">
&s;econd Kudarin&s;koi, 21 miles; the third, at the di&s;tance of 34 miles from the latter; the next, at 18 miles di&s;tance; and the la&s;t, at 10 miles; where the T&s;chi|koi leaves the frontiers. The line thence runs on the river Man&s;a; and the next &s;tation is Mon&s;hin&s;koi, at a di&s;tance of 112 miles: then follow the high moun|tains that divide the rivers of Baikal from tho&s;e of the Amur; from whence it is 120 miles to the next po&s;t on the Bal&s;kikan, dependant on Ak&s;chin&s;kaja.</P>
<P>I will now give as complete a de&s;cription as I can of the Chine&s;e frontier and commercial town, which is called by the Ru&s;&s;ians <HI>Kitai&s;kaja Sloboda</HI> (the Chine&s;e borough); the place having, properly &s;peaking, no name of its own. The Chine&s;e name is <HI>Maimut&s;chin,</HI> compo&s;ed of Nikanian and Man&s;hurian words, <HI>Maima,</HI> and <HI>T&s;chin,</HI> or <HI>T&s;chen;</HI> the former of which implies commerce, and the latter, a place &s;urrounded with walls. The town lies not more than 60 fathoms from the &s;outhern wall of the fortre&s;s Kjachta, on a fine and even &s;pot, quite &s;eque&s;tered from the brook Kjachta, and con&s;i&s;ts of 200 dwellings. In the middle, between the two towns, &s;tand two boundary-po&s;ts, 10 feet high; one with a Ru&s;&s;ian in&s;cription, and the other with a Man&s;hurian. The Chine&s;e borough has no other for|tifications, than a &s;quare, wooden wall, which, in 1756, during the la&s;t Kalmuck war with the Choitian prince Amur&s;aran, when this frontier-place was threatened with fire and &s;word, by a Mongol, who revolted again&s;t
<PB N="45" REF="46">
their prince Schadir Wang, was erected in ha&s;te, with a ditch &s;carce three feet broad. This fortification, if it can be &s;o called, is flanked by a long &s;pace, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, who&s;e longe&s;t &s;ide is 350 fathoms, and the &s;horte&s;t 200 fathoms. Each wall has, in the middle, a principal gate, opening into the chief &s;treets. Over each gate is a wooden centinel-box, where part of the Chine&s;e garri&s;on, which con&s;i&s;ts of ragged Mongols, with clubs, &s;tands on guard at night. Before the gates, on the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ide, are wooden walls, erected in the Chine&s;e way, 28 feet from the gates, to prevent any per&s;ons looking into the town. The hou&s;es are built in regular, direct lines, and compo&s;e two principal &s;treets, from 21 to 28 feet wide, cro&s;&s;ing each other in the centre of the place; and two other &s;ide-&s;treets, running from north to &s;outh. They are not paved, but gravelled; have drains in the middle, and are kept very clean.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es are &s;pacious, and each occupies a long oblong place, covered with gravel, and kept very clean; having, to the &s;treet, a large long portico, or pa&s;&s;age, leading to the yard, with &s;ide-doors and &s;tore-rooms: the re&s;t of the hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of dwelling-rooms, &s;tore-rooms, and a kitchen. All the buildings are uni|form, not more than 14 feet high, without &s;tories, built of wood, pla&s;tered with loam, and painted white. The roofs are flat and boarded, and &s;upported by pil|lars; but the roofs of the common hou&s;es, are made
<PB N="46" REF="47">
with cro&s;s poles, and covered with turf. In all build|ings, the windows are large, and made in the European way; but, as gla&s;s and i&s;ingla&s;s are too dear, are co|vered with paper, except a few of the dwelling-rooms, of which the windows are glazed. Paper-windows are commonly ornamented with little pictures. One of the rooms &s;erves as a &s;hop, and contains &s;amples of every merchandize the proprietor deals in. The floors are bricked, and the walls papered, as in England; and within are proper &s;creens, to keep off the du&s;t. Round half the room is a broad, painted bench, two feet high, on which the family eats and &s;leeps. On this bench is al&s;o a &s;quare, brick oven, two or three feet high, with a perpendicular, cylindrical opening, like a fire-place, in which they burn wood. The &s;moke from this fire-place, is carried from above, downwards, by a pipe, un|derneath the bench, and conveyed out of the room into the &s;treet, and there carried up in a perpendicular chimney, not rai&s;ed higher than the roof. This fire-place makes the bench and walls &s;o warm in winter, that if the head is laid next the wall, the per&s;on cannot &s;leep. Within the room is no other furniture than two little, low tables, &s;tanding on a bench, on which is al|ways placed a pan of burning coals, which emits no vapour, and &s;erves to light their tobacco-pipes. In a particular niche, &s;creened by &s;ilk curtains, are &s;ome elegant pagods, drawn on paper, before which, on fe&s;|tivals, they place burning lamps and candles, and a curious cinder-box, made of metal or &s;tone, in which
<PB N="47" REF="48">
the a&s;hes and droppings of the incen&s;e-candles are pre|&s;erved, with many little ornaments, and bouquets of artificial flowers.</P>
<P>Their kitchens &s;urpa&s;s the be&s;t European ones, in cleanline&s;s and order; and have, be&s;ides the broad bench on which the &s;ervants &s;leep, and the fire-place, upon it, two other fire-places, in which iron, or &s;tone-boilers, are fixed. They have nothing particular in their kitchen-furniture, but broad knives, with which they mince and pre&s;s their meat into moulds, before it is &s;erved up. The blades are near &s;ix inches &s;quare, made of poli&s;hed &s;teel, with a wooden handle, who&s;e cutting edge is as &s;harp as a razor: the cook takes one of the&s;e knives in each hand, minces the meat without touching it, and then pre&s;&s;es it into moulds.</P>
<P>This is all I can &s;ay of the Chine&s;e hou&s;es. The pub|lic buildings of their towns on the frontiers, are no other than the man&s;ion of the Surgut&s;chei, or chief of the merchants, and a little Mahomedan met&s;ched, in tho&s;e places where the Bucharians live.</P>
<P>One of the pagodas of this frontier-town, is built in the middle of the place, where both the principal &s;treets cro&s;s each other; it is in the form of a Chine&s;e tower, through which pa&s;&s;engers can pa&s;s into both &s;treets; the opening being-in the form of a cro&s;s. Above this

portico, the building is &s;quare, with a covered gallery round it, the roof &s;upported with pillars. In another &s;tory, above this, the building is octangular, and has eight bells, which are ea&s;ily moved with the wind, and give a plea&s;ing &s;ound, and round this part is an|other gallery, like the one below. In the lower &s;tory of this building, &s;tands the image of the god <HI>Tjen,</HI> which, according to the accounts given me by the mo&s;t enlightened of the Chine&s;e I met with, reigns over 32 heavens. The Man&s;hours call him <HI>Abcho,</HI> and the Mongols, <HI>Tingeru;</HI> that is, heaven, or a god of heaven. It &s;its, with nothing on its head but hair, encompa&s;&s;ed with a glory, like the images of Chri&s;t, a &s;traight &s;word in his right hand, and his left lifted, as if giving his ble&s;&s;ing. This figure of the pagod, with the Roman-Catholic images of the Redeemer, is perhaps the cau&s;e of the Chine&s;e Surgut&s;chei (through who&s;e favour I got a &s;ight of this temple), a&s;&s;uring me, that the Je&s;uits, and their &s;ectaries, who lived in &s;o great re&s;pect and authority at the court of Peking, wor&s;hipped it equally with the Chine&s;e. Probably the&s;e holy fathers may have given the re&s;emblance of the Chine&s;e Tjen to their repre&s;entations of Chri&s;t, to excite more the devotion of their new converts. Near this idol Tjen &s;tands, on one &s;ide, two youths; and, on the other, a girl, and an old man. In the upper &s;tory of the building, is another idol, in a black and white chequered cap, al&s;o accom|panied by a venerable, old man, and three young peo|ple. Neither in this, or the other part of the building,
<PB N="49" REF="50">
are any altars or ornaments, but the&s;e round the pa|godas. Their temples are only opened on fea&s;t-days, and &s;trangers cannot enter without permi&s;&s;ion; yet the Chine&s;e &s;hew the&s;e idols no more reverence than tho&s;e in the greater pagoda.</P>
<P>The great pagoda is far more &s;plendid and &s;pa|cious, and &s;tands near the &s;outhern principal-gate, before the man&s;ion of the Surgut&s;chei. Strangers may &s;ee it almo&s;t every hour of the day, by ap|plying to an under-prie&s;t, who re&s;ides for this pur|po&s;e in the fore-court, the entrance to which, is for|tified with <HI>Cheveux-de-frize.</HI> We are conducted through two, little, elegant gates, divided by a &s;mall building. Oppo&s;ite the&s;e gates &s;tands a little, painted theatre, near which are erected on each &s;ide two, high poles, on which they &s;pread, on fe&s;tivals, large flags with Chine&s;e characters; and, on &s;ome peculiar fe&s;tivals, on this theatre are exhibited little burlettas in honour of the idols, where the merchants' clerks are the principal actors, the &s;pectators &s;tanding in the &s;treet.</P>
<P>In the little building between the gates of the fir&s;t court of the temple, within grates, are two &s;addle-hor&s;es moulded in clay, as large as life, and turned towards the South. One is a &s;orrel bay, repre&s;ented as leaping, and the other of a dun colour with a black mane and tail, walking: each as led by two men, dre&s;&s;ed like grooms,
<PB N="50" REF="51">
and &s;culptured with great &s;kill. Near each hor&s;e &s;tands a yellow, &s;ilk-flag, painted with &s;ilver dra|gons, but no further ornaments. Ju&s;t within the gates of the fir&s;t court, are two covered &s;caffolds encompa&s;&s;ed with a gallery; on one hangs a large bell of ca&s;t iron, pulled by a wooden club, and on the other, two enormous tymbals, like tho&s;e in Kal|muck pagodas. There are al&s;o, here two other front buildings, that &s;erve as dwellings for the &s;ervants of the prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>From this outward court, we enter through one large and two little painted and carved gates, into the inner|mo&s;t temple, which has &s;mall buildings on both &s;ides, divided into pagodas, like alcoves with grated doors, who&s;e walls within are ornamented with pictures repre&s;enting the actions of the Gods; thence we go to the hall of the temple, which, like the temple it&s;elf, is &s;urrounded with pillars, varni&s;hed, gilt and carved with an elegant, Chine&s;e roof, a gallery, and little bells hanging round it. This hall repre&s;ents an armory. In it, along the walls, on ledges or &s;caf|folds, are all &s;orts of gigantic and ancient arms, and warlike emblems, as &s;pears, &s;cythes, broad blades fa&s;tened on many &s;pear-poles, morning-&s;tars, &s;hields, banners with hinds and dragon's heads, elegantly gilt. Oppo&s;ite the fore-door is an enormous, yellow flag embroidered with &s;ilver dragons and leaf-work, under|neath which, &s;tand all kinds of altars &s;kreened, and
<PB N="51" REF="52">
&s;everal oblong tables &s;tanding on pede&s;tals, with Chi|ne&s;e in&s;criptions. From the gate behind this place, pa&s;&s;ing a court about ten fathoms long and five broad, we come to the temple it&s;elf, through a &s;hort, uncovered gallery, decorated with flower-pots. In the gallery before the temple, &s;upported by a row of pillars, &s;tand, right and left of the entrance, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the gates, two bordered tables, of black &s;late, &s;even feet high, on which, is en|graved a long detail of the foundation of the tem|ple. Before the pede&s;tal of the we&s;tern table, there is, in a &s;mall ca&s;e, a little, frightful image, about &s;ix inches high. The temple within is beautifully ornamented, and exhibits, on the walls, many warlike adventures and marches of the chief idol. All the idols are modelled in clay, &s;kilfully executed in gigan|tic &s;hape, and placed on pede&s;tals four feet high, on three niches, which occupy the whole northern wall. The niches are decorated with a great deal of carving and gilt ornaments. The chief idol that occupies the niche in the centre between two pillars, wreathed with gilt dragons, is Ged&s;ur or Ge&s;&s;ur Khan, called by the Chine&s;e <HI>Coujil,</HI> or the fir&s;t and elde&s;t, by the Man&s;hours <HI>Guanloe</HI> (the chief god), and to his hi&s;tory the above-mentioned hor&s;es allude, This figure, repre&s;ented &s;plendidly &s;itting and dre&s;&s;ed, has a gilt beard, a crown on his head, and is in &s;ize four times as large as a man. His cloaths are not modelled in clay, like the re&s;t of the idols, but are
<PB N="52" REF="53">
made of &s;ilk, and elegantly formed. He holds, in his hands, before him a board, as if reading with earne&s;tne&s;s. On his right and left are two little, fe|male figures, repre&s;enting children of thirteen years of age, one of whom, holds a paper roll. Before this figure, which repre&s;ents nothing more than &s;ome peaceable prince or judge, lie, on the right, &s;even golden arrows, and on the the left a bow. The Mongols and Kalmucks, do not wor&s;hip it as an idol, but acknowledge it to be &s;ome great hero, who lived near the &s;ource of the river Choango, and who, like the Bacchus and Hercules of ea&s;tern Tar|tary, vanqui&s;hed many mon&s;ters: and they have in their language a long hi&s;tory of his heroic deeds. Before this idol, is a &s;pacious place encompa&s;&s;ed with &s;hrines and in the mid&s;t &s;tands an altar with &s;trips of narrow &s;ilk, hanging over it, as in Monga|lian temples. About the altar, are four, &s;tanding figures in couples, turning their faces to each other, repre&s;enting ancient coun&s;ellors and generals of the deified Ge&s;&s;ur Khan. All the figures are of Colo&s;&s;al &s;ize, but not &s;o large as the idol it&s;elf. Tho&s;e that &s;tood next the&s;e Pagodas, were dre&s;&s;ed like judges, and held boards in their hands, like the Ge&s;&s;ur Khan; one had a white beard, and &s;eemed as if &s;inging, and of the two others, one on the left was dre&s;&s;ed in armour, wore a kind of turban, and carried a large &s;heathed &s;word on the left &s;houlder, the handle upwards; the other was cloathed al&s;o in warlike dre&s;s,
<PB N="53" REF="54">
very corpulent, with a horrid, red-brown face, having in his right hand, a &s;pear-pole with a broad blade at the end.</P>
<P>In each &s;ide-divi&s;ion are two idols &s;eated, one in a military dre&s;s, and one in that of a Mandarin. All four &s;horter than Ge&s;&s;ur Khan, but &s;till of gigan|tic &s;ize.</P>
<P>The warlike figure on the right, repre&s;ents the god Ma&s;uang or the Ot&s;chirboni of the Mongols, who&s;e very look is frightful; it is habited in armour, and has a looking-gla&s;s on its brea&s;t, one eye in its navel, and on the head three faces of &s;uch a dark-brown colour, as to be almo&s;t black. It has &s;ix arms, two of which, hold bent &s;words acro&s;s the head. The next figure on the right, has al&s;o a looking-gla&s;s; the next on the left, &s;omething &s;quare, re&s;embling a piece of ivory, but in its hands, a bent bow, as if going to &s;hoot.</P>
<P>The god that &s;its near him, is called by the Chine&s;e <HI>Zau&s;ching,</HI> or the gold and &s;ilver god, and by the Mongols <HI>Zagan-D&s;ambola.</HI> It has a black cap on the head with two obtu&s;e corners, in its hand a box filled with jewels, and is dre&s;&s;ed in rich, Chine&s;e robes of &s;tate. On one &s;ide &s;tand two &s;mall figures, one of which held a branch of a tree. Two &s;imilar figures accompany al&s;o, the former, one having an
<PB N="54" REF="55">
arrow in his hand, and the other an animal. In a divi&s;ion on the left, is the god Chu&s;ko, or in the Man&s;hour dialect <HI>Chua-a&s;chan,</HI> whom the Mongols call <HI>Galdi</HI> or Fire-god, with a frightful, fiery face, in com|plete armour, holding in his hand a drawn &s;word, and, though &s;itting, appears as if &s;uddenly ri&s;ing. One of his &s;atellites is repre&s;ented as if crying out, the other, bearing in his hand a bird like a duck. Another idol on this &s;ide, is the god of bullocks, Niu-o. He is repre&s;ented as quietly &s;itting in Mandarine robes, a crown on his head, and, like all the preceding ones, with a round looking-gla&s;s on his brea&s;t. The Chi|ne&s;e take him to be the &s;ame with the Jamandaga of the Mongols. His Man&s;hour name is &s;aid to be <HI>Chain-Killowa,</HI> but the Mongols call him <HI>Bars-Batir,</HI> (Tyger-hero). The Chine&s;e are &s;o &s;u&s;picious, that the mo&s;t affable will refu&s;e to give you the names of their idols, and if, they &s;ee any one attempt to write them down, will give them a fictitious name; of cour&s;e, I cannot take upon me to warrant all the names I here give, particularly tho&s;e of the Chine&s;e.</P>
<P>The idol Niu-o has his table al&s;o, on which they &s;erve him on fe&s;tivals, with all &s;orts of baked meats, dried fruits, and other dainties, be&s;ides other vic|tuals, even meat, and whole carca&s;&s;es of &s;heep. Be|fore him are placed urns, frankincen&s;e, wax-candles, and lamps, &s;ome of which, before the principal pa|god, are kept burning night and day. Among other
<PB N="55" REF="56">
things we &s;ee a ve&s;&s;el re&s;embling a quiver filled with a great many long, flat &s;ticks made of &s;plit canes, upon which are written little, Chine&s;e mottos, which fore|tell the fate of any one the en&s;uing year, that &s;hall draw out an arrow from the quiver, on new-year's-day. At the ea&s;t end of the table lies a hollow, wooden, black, varni&s;hed helmet, on which tho&s;e who a&s;&s;emble for the &s;ake of devotion in the temple, knock with a beater. No &s;tranger dare knock this helmet, though he is allowed to touch every other thing on the pa|goda, and examine the idols as near as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>There is very little to be &s;aid of the re&s;t of their pub|lic buildings. The hou&s;e of the Surgut&s;chei or director of the merchants, &s;tands on a great deal of ground, and is very neatly furni&s;hed, but has nothing peculiar, except two flag-poles erected at the gate, which are its di&s;tinctive marks, and the &s;olemn tribunal which &s;tands in the hall. The quarter where the Bucha|rians live, is in the &s;outh-ea&s;t corner of the town, where they have a little, plain met&s;ched or chapel, built of wood. The Bucharians, who imitate the Chine&s;e in their dre&s;s, are badly and &s;habbily lodged, notwith&s;tanding their con&s;iderable commerce with the court of Peking, which is &s;upplied by Bucharian mer|chants, who come here annually for that purpo&s;e. Whatever goods &s;uch a Bucharian merchant or com|mi&s;&s;ioner from Peking wants to buy, cannot be &s;old to any other Chine&s;e merchant, on pain of &s;evere
<PB N="56" REF="57">
puni&s;hment, till the former has accompli&s;hed his pur|cha&s;e; though the other &s;hould offer a much higher price.</P>
<P>We will now &s;peak of the Chine&s;e them&s;elves, and of the trade of that nation. The merchants who re&s;ide here, are chiefly Nikanians, or natives from the northern provinces of China, e&s;pecially from Peking, Santchuen, and &s;ome other cities. They dwell here like travellers, without their families, for in the whole Chine&s;e market-towns, no woman is to be &s;een. Tho&s;e however, who feel their Oriental blood, are very ga|lant cu&s;tomers to the women in Kjachta, who to the prejudice of their national honour, are frail to an ex|ce&s;s. The Chine&s;e are al&s;o charged with unnatural crimes, at lea&s;t they are remarked for keeping young, fine-made &s;hop-men, with whom they are very fami|liar. Some, al&s;o, &s;pend large &s;ums in the Mongalian quarters, with females of that nation, of whom I &s;hall &s;ay more hereafter.</P>
<P>All the Chine&s;e merchants here re&s;iding, trade in partner&s;hip, two or more together, relieving each other by turns, one conducting the bu&s;ine&s;s a whole year in Kjachta, whil&s;t the other goes home for fre&s;h merchandize; on the arrival of the latter, the former &s;ets off with the goods bartered for, and returns the next year with a new cargo. The Sur|gut&s;chei pre&s;ides, with the power of a magi&s;trate, over
<PB N="57" REF="58">
the merchants here re&s;iding; and not only keeps up a rigid police, but directs the trade, and gives orders re&s;pecting it, that no advantage in commerce may be lo&s;t. He is generally a man of rank and abilities, but it &s;ometimes happens that Mandarins who have com|mitted, in other places, certain mi&s;demeanors, are &s;ent here to undertake this office, for their puni&s;hment and reformation. His characteri&s;tic mark of di&s;tinc|tion is a cry&s;tal button on his cap, and a peacock's fea|ther behind. The Chine&s;e give him the title of <HI>Amban,</HI> (commander in chief). No one dares approach him, but bending his left knee, in which po&s;ture he re|mains the whole time he is &s;peaking, and until he receives the Amban's an&s;wer. This magi&s;trate has a &s;alary, but far inferior to the pre&s;ents made him by the merchants. In China, it is the privilege only of high rank, to ride in a four-wheeled carriage. The Surgut&s;chei rides in a covered cart, with two wheels only.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons of the Chine&s;e are &s;ufficiently known; they are well formed, and many young per&s;ons have &s;weet, fair faces, to which their &s;mall black eyes and jetty hair give an agreeable turn: yet we frequently meet with broad Man&s;hourian-like ma&s;ks, high cheek-bones, broad no&s;es between the eyes, and extraor|dinary large ears, which &s;eems to be national to this people. Elderly men &s;uffer their black beards to grow, but all &s;have their heads in the Man&s;hourian
<PB N="58" REF="59">
way, leaving only one thick, lock on the crown, which is univer&s;ally black, and which they braid into a tre&s;s. Hence they are good cu&s;tomers to the barbers, who&s;e hou&s;es are di&s;tingui&s;hed by little flags hung out at the door.</P>
<P>Their dre&s;s is very uniform, and &s;uited to the &s;ea|&s;on; they have particular clothes for the &s;ummer and winter, and others for the intervals of the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons. This difference is mo&s;t remarkable in their caps. In &s;pring and autumn, they wear little, round covers, which barely hide the crown of the head, who&s;e &s;tanding border is covered with the &s;kin of a &s;ea-dog, or &s;ea-bear, or with velvet; having at the top, a little button, and a ta&s;&s;il of twi&s;ted, red &s;ilk, which over&s;preads the whole hat. In &s;ummer, they go about with wide &s;traw-hats, re&s;embling a bowl, which &s;hade the face; the&s;e are neatly made, co&s;t often from four, to &s;ix rubles, each, and have an elegant fringe of long, red &s;hining hair, taken from wild, Tangutian cows, the <HI>bos grunniens</HI> of Linnaeus, which the Chine&s;e call <HI>Sinija,</HI> the Mongols, <HI>Sarlikukyr.</HI> In winter they wear flat caps edged with fox-&s;kins, and fringed at the top: the&s;e do not cover the ears. All European nations take off their hat, in the pre&s;ence of per&s;ons of rank; but it would be a &s;in again&s;t Chine&s;e politene&s;s and re&s;pect, to do the &s;ame. Their garments vary, in every &s;ea&s;on, in the thickne&s;s of the linen and &s;tuff of which they are made. Merchants of all ranks,
<PB N="59" REF="60">
wear the &s;ame dre&s;s, which is chiefly &s;hining, cotton &s;tuffs <HI>(Kitaika)</HI> generally black, but &s;ometimes dyed of a deep blue. This is their dre&s;s from &s;pring to autumn, and con&s;i&s;ts of a garment which reaches to the ancles, with narrow &s;leeves. Behind, it is &s;lit open to the wai&s;t, and ornamented before with but|tons the whole length. Over this they wear &s;omething re&s;embling a woman's jacket, without &s;leeves, pa&s;&s;ing the arm through a hole, and above all, a &s;hort wai&s;t|coat, who&s;e &s;leeves reach to the elbow, made of &s;ilk, and lined with the fur of the paws of &s;able, fox, or &s;ea-bear, with the hair outwards. Per&s;ons of di&s;tinc|tion wear their wai&s;tcoats made of curled, black &s;heep-&s;kins, &s;ables, or the &s;ea-bears of Kam&s;chatka. The latter articles are of importance, are part of the Ru&s;|&s;ian trade, and worn by the whole court of Peking. They wear al&s;o wide boots covered with black &s;ilk, the &s;oles of which are heavy, half an inch thick, and made of coar&s;e, cotton &s;tuff <HI>(Daba)</HI> glued together, and are &s;aid to la&s;t &s;everal years. On their girdle, which fa&s;tens their under-garment, they carry, con&s;tantly, long, &s;ilk tobacco pouches and pipes, and a ca&s;e containing knives and the little chop-&s;ticks, which they u&s;e as forks. They are always &s;o dre&s;&s;ed, both at home and abroad. Their per&s;ons and hou&s;es are kept with great cleanline&s;s, which &s;eems the more &s;urpri&s;ing, as all the dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s is performed by men. They are inured to cold, of cour&s;e, their rooms are &s;o little heated in winter, that an European would
<PB N="60" REF="61">
be chilled in them. Many, e&s;pecially opulent mer|chants, who do not meddle with packing and unpacking of their goods, let the nails grow on their fingers to the length of half an inch. I &s;aw &s;ome who&s;e nails were rolled up and grown into the fle&s;h. A European would not be able to imitate this odd cu&s;tom without difficulty, and would often lo&s;e his nails, before they attained their proper &s;hape and &s;trength.</P>
<P>Their food is clean, very nutritive, and &s;uited to the &s;ea&s;ons. They are remarkably fond of garden-fruits, vegetables and &s;weet-meats, and eat a great deal of garlick. In &s;ummer they &s;upply Kjachta with cole|worts, girkins, radi&s;hes and French-beans, and cul|tivate for their own u&s;e &s;pinach, celery, par&s;ley, yellow-par&s;nips, and a kind of colewort, &s;plit like endive. As other productions of European gardens do not ripen here, they bring with them rice, &s;everal &s;orts of peas, al&s;o dried, and, in winter, frozen fruits. Among their peas I remarked an oblong, little, green &s;pecies, called <HI>Lodou,</HI> which appears to be the <HI>Pha&s;eolus radiatus</HI> of Linnaeus, and which they &s;uffer to attain their full growth, during winter, in water which they often change, and then eat them raw in&s;tead of &s;allad. The mo&s;t common, fre&s;h fruits which may be had of the Chine&s;e, are water-melons, apples, <HI>(Pin&s;a)</HI> like green <HI>Pommes de Rennette,</HI> pears, a &s;pecies of oblong quinces, <HI>(Mugha),</HI> citrons, &s;weet and &s;our oranges, wild che&s;nuts <HI>(Kid&s;a),</HI> large walnuts, a little, red pen|tagonal
<PB N="61" REF="62">
medlars, which grow wild in the northern parts of China, and of which, with &s;ugar, they make a cheap jelly, called by the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants <HI>po&s;tila.</HI> They have al&s;o a fruit called <HI>alema,</HI> which &s;eems to be nothing more than a Tka&s;chu apple, and brought from the &s;outhern provinces. They have al&s;o a very peculiar &s;pecies of citron, <HI>(fui&s;chu,)</HI> divided like a lily-root into 12 parts, without kernel, and uncommonly fragrant; but the&s;e are only di&s;tributed as gifts, by the Surgut&s;chei. Of dried fruits the Chine&s;e have long rai&s;ins, with a large kernel; &s;mall, black, &s;our|i&s;h rai&s;ins; little fruits of a &s;pecies of <HI>elaeagnus,</HI> with a peculiar kernel, called by the Bucharians <HI>d&s;higda,</HI> by the Mongols <HI>zagda,</HI> and by the Chine&s;e <HI>&s;azu&s;a;</HI> a &s;pecies of reddi&s;h, &s;moked prunes, <HI>(&s;chuptuga,)</HI> with a kernel like a roller; little, black plums, dried apples, oranges &s;queezed and boiled in &s;ugar, pre|&s;erved ginger, black, &s;weeti&s;h fruits with many flat kernels, <HI>(choder,)</HI> &s;ome of which are brought from Per&s;ia, and are called <HI>gorokum;</HI> a &s;hell-fruit, with a large, round kernel, encompa&s;&s;ed with a &s;weet &s;ub|&s;tance, exqui&s;itely mellow: This &s;ub&s;tance is pre&s;&s;ed together into flat cakes, wrapt up in bamboo leaves, and u&s;ed as a cordial &s;weetmeat; it is brought from the &s;outhernmo&s;t provinces, and &s;old by the name of <HI>gaklo.</HI> They have al&s;o other fruits, with one or two nut-like kernels; whole flat nuts, in form of an apricot-&s;tone, with a bitteri&s;h, purgative kernel, <HI>(lan&s;u,</HI> or <HI>boigo);</HI> common almonds, pimenti and other cheap
<PB N="62" REF="63">
&s;pices. Among their other eatables the Chine&s;e have crabs, brought from the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and &s;alted, which they eat with rice; &s;ea-&s;nails, dried on &s;trings, <HI>(holo|thuria tremula Linnaei,</HI> in Chine&s;e <HI>chair&s;an,)</HI> and a gri&s;tly, &s;ea production, called <HI>d&s;hileng.</HI> With the lat|ter they al&s;o brought me &s;ome particular dried flowers, <HI>(t&s;chent&s;cheng,)</HI> which they boil in &s;oups, and are brought from the &s;outhernmo&s;t parts. They have &s;ometimes al&s;o &s;pongy roots of a water-plant, con|&s;i&s;ting of members an inch long. The Chine&s;e bring al&s;o, in winter, frozen phea&s;ants to Kjachta, which they find on this &s;ide the Chine&s;e wall, on the &s;outhern parts of the mountains which &s;eparate the rivers Amur and Choango; but are mo&s;tly met with about the latter river. They are &s;aid to be fond of dog's fle&s;h, and that it is publicly &s;old in the markets at Peking; but the Chine&s;e here will not admit it. They al&s;o carefully conceal their eating, as a dainty, the legs of frogs, and a &s;pecies of large wingle&s;s gra&s;&s;|hopper, common about the river Selenga, probably becau&s;e they have been laughed at for it by the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual drink of the Chine&s;e is tea, which they keep almo&s;t the whole day on the fire, and drink it whenever they are dry; they boil it a &s;econd time, make it very weak, and u&s;e little or no &s;ugar. Their &s;trong liquors are, the tara&s;ur, which may be com|pared to Engli&s;h beer mixed with brandy, and a kind of brandy, called in Mongol <HI>Chant&s;china.</HI> Many of

the Chine&s;e are &s;o much addicted to the free u&s;e of this and other Ru&s;&s;ian, &s;trong liquors, that we com|monly &s;ee the lower cla&s;s going about the town with chains on their legs, the u&s;ual puni&s;hment for fighting and other exce&s;&s;es committed by people in liquor: it is probably owing to this policy that a drunken Chine&s;e is &s;eldom &s;een abroad.</P>
<P>They cannot exi&s;t without &s;moaking tobacco. If at lei&s;ure, they will never let a quarter of an hour pa&s;s without taking a pipe; &s;o that they are con&s;tantly &s;moaking in the &s;treets. As the bowls of their pipes are not much larger than a thimble, they have the plea&s;ure of filling and lighting them often.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e of this place are affable and ho&s;pita|ble; and though they never like to treat a &s;tranger with any thing but tobacco and tea, they are in this liberal to every vi&s;itor. To acquaintances they will pre&s;ent &s;weetmeats, and various &s;orts of fruits. When they vi&s;it the Ru&s;&s;ians, let them be ever &s;o &s;trange, they are impetuous, and without paying any regard to rank, very bold, and often unpolite: they will enter hou&s;es uninvited, with their pipes in their hands, &s;it down una&s;ked, and continue &s;itting as long as they plea&s;e, let the people of the hou&s;e take it as they will. It &s;eems the Ru&s;&s;ians have led them into this unman|nerly conduct by their too great indulgence; for in pre|&s;ence of their own &s;uperiors they always keep a re&s;pect|ful
<PB N="64" REF="65">
di&s;tance. They are fond of games; and when they have no bu&s;ine&s;s to employ them, are generally &s;een playing at draughts at home, in their own way, or with little Chine&s;e cards in their hands.&mdash;To gratify this pa&s;&s;ion, they frequently buy many Ru&s;&s;ian copper and &s;ilver coins to game with, and purcha&s;e, from the Ru&s;&s;ians, eatables and other little nece&s;&s;aries the cheaper.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of di&s;tinction play, in their hours of lei&s;ure, with a ro&s;ary in their hands; and &s;ome of the middle cla&s;s carry &s;uch ro&s;aries made of larch re&s;in, conti|nually along with them, which the &s;weat of their hands renders as hard and tran&s;parent as yellow amber, and will fetch a good price among the Mongols.</P>
<P>In their trade and conduct with the Ru&s;&s;ians, they are exceedingly crafty, &s;ecret and intere&s;ted, and hereby have a great advantage over the per&s;ons they deal with, who are not a match for them. The Ru&s;&s;ians are &s;trictly punctual and exact in trade, and are kept to this by the Surgut&s;chei, who &s;trives all he can to advance its &s;ucce&s;s; but the Chine&s;e too often render the be&s;t regulations fruitle&s;s, by their &s;elfi&s;h, gid|dy and chattering mode of dealing, if not kept within bounds by the &s;evere in&s;pection of &s;ome commercial chief. This has made the Chine&s;e well-acquainted with the value of Ru&s;&s;ian productions, and enables them to keep their own in a proper balance; for the
<PB N="65" REF="66">
Surgut&s;chei puni&s;hes tho&s;e who attempt to &s;poil ano|ther's bargain by under&s;elling him; he al&s;o takes care that the markets are not over&s;tocked; for as the gene|ral rendezvous of the caravans from all the towns and cities of the Chine&s;e empire a&s;&s;emble in the Mongalian court-quarters on the river Tola, 375 miles from Kjachta, they are only &s;uffered to come from that place in moderate numbers to this frontier town, in January, May, and autumn. For this leave they pay a duty of five <HI>per cent.</HI> for all Ru&s;&s;ian goods on return. This &s;mall duty is what gives the Chine&s;e the prin|cipal advantage over Ru&s;&s;ian merchants.</P>
<P>The goods are mo&s;tly brought here on camels; yet the Chine&s;e make u&s;e of a bad kind of cart with two awkward wheels, having two cro&s;s beams, and a third pa&s;&s;ing the centre, through which the axle-tree is fixed, and which turns with the wheels. When the merchant caravans travel in winter through the &s;tep, they carry with them felt tents, which they erect at night. In &s;ummer they have fine hut-frames made of cane, which they &s;old up together like a fan, and put into wooden ca&s;es, occupying no more room than &s;even inches in length, and four inches in height and breadth, and yet, when &s;pread out and covered with a &s;ail-cloth or mat, two per&s;ons may &s;it and &s;leep therein, and be entirely &s;heltered from the &s;un and rain. They are u&s;ually 46 days on their journey to the next town, &s;ituate on the great wall, called <HI>Zi&s;ongku</HI> or <HI>Schan&s;|chiacho,</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="67">
by the Mongols <HI>Kalgan</HI> or <HI>Kalcha,</HI> (new gate,) and from thence to Peking four or five days, and from Kalgan to Sant&s;chuen about a fortnight.</P>
<P>The Nikanian trade&s;men on the frontiers all under|&s;tand the Mongalian language, in which the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants talk to them, either them&s;elves, or by ap|pointed, &s;worn interpreters. Many &s;peak broken Ru&s;s; but their pronunciation is &s;o &s;oft and defective, that a Ru&s;&s;ian can &s;carcely under&s;tand them. They cannot pronounce the letter <HI>r</HI> at all; but &s;ound it as an <HI>l.</HI> They al&s;o divide by vowels &s;uch &s;yllables, which, if joined together, have more than one mute letter, wherein the Ru&s;s language is very rich. The&s;e two defects are never ob&s;erved in Tartars, Mongols, Kalmucks, and other A&s;iatics, who learn the Ru&s;&s;ian language.</P>
<P>The trade with the Chine&s;e is chiefly carried on by barter or exchange of goods. The Chine&s;e come to the Ru&s;&s;ian mart, where &s;amples are laid out, and they chu&s;e what they like. Contracts for goods are &s;ometimes made in the market; but the Chine&s;e gene|rally go home with the Ru&s;&s;ian merchant to his hou&s;e, and there make the agreement. At fir&s;t it is &s;ettled what goods the Ru&s;&s;ian merchant can and will take; then the quantity and re&s;pective value of the goods to be mutually exchanged are agreed on; and after having drank tea, and both parties having fini&s;hed their
<PB N="67" REF="68">
bargain, they go to the warehou&s;e, where the Chine&s;e dealer marks all the bales of goods and other articles he has agreed for, which is &s;ometimes the contents of the whole &s;hop; this done, the Ru&s;&s;ian merchant goes to the hou&s;e of the Chine&s;e dealer, and in&s;pects his goods, enquires into the value, and particularly if they are all perfect, and having fixed on what he likes, &s;eparates them from the re&s;t, and leaves a per&s;on in charge of them, and to take care they are not altered or dimini&s;hed, till an opportunity &s;uits to ex|change the goods mutually, according to agreement. In this exchange the Ru&s;&s;ian merchant rates the value of mo&s;t Chine&s;e goods at a half, a third, and often at a quarter of the price at which he values his own, which he can the readier do, as Siberian furs may always be bartered at double the price they are fre|quently bought for, and are in goodne&s;s and value a very arbitrary merchandize. Without this advantage it would be impo&s;&s;ible for the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants, who are at &s;o great an expence for tran&s;porting them, to pay a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e duty of 20 to 25 <HI>per cent.</HI> for mo&s;t of the goods they &s;ell to and buy of the Chine&s;e; hence it &s;eems evident that a whole&s;ale trade of cur|rent Ru&s;&s;ian money would be injurious to the &s;tate; and for this rea&s;on the court of Peter&s;burg has prohi|bited it. The greate&s;t di&s;advantage the Ru&s;&s;ian trade labours under is, that &s;ome merchants who arrive from the di&s;tant parts of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire, &s;ell to the Chine&s;e at a lower valuation, in order to be able to
<PB N="68" REF="69">
make their bargains, and return the &s;ooner; yet there is a commercial e&s;tabli&s;hment formed by a com|pany of Ru&s;s merchants in Kjachta who, by autho|rity, fix the prices of merchandize among them&s;elves, in&s;truct the travelling merchants of this, as &s;oon as they arrive, and endeavour to per&s;uade them into what is right; yet, in &s;pite of all this, there being no &s;everity of puni&s;hment inflicted on tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, they cannot always prevent it. Be&s;ides, there are many young, Ru&s;s merchants who, by babbling, when half-drunk, will let the Chine&s;e perfectly into all tho&s;e circum|&s;tances which the re&s;t would wi&s;h to have concealed.</P>
<P>Here follows a li&s;t of the prices and &s;orts of &s;ome kinds of goods exchanged by the Ru&s;&s;ians and Chi|ne&s;e, according to a late regulation of the chief com|mi&s;&s;ioner of the frontiers. This li&s;t contains the high|e&s;t and lowe&s;t prices from 1770 to 1772.</P>

The &s;ilk &s;tuffs, which the Chine&s;e bring to Kjachta, are now much inferior in goodne&s;s and value to tho&s;e they u&s;ed to bring formerly: their &s;atins and dama&s;ks are al&s;o &s;o thin and &s;lim&s;y, that they will &s;carcely do for Ru&s;&s;ian cities. Rich and thick &s;atins, and other good &s;tuffs, are now &s;eldom &s;een. Their thin taffeties, if made of good &s;ilk, and not oiled, and their Kitaika, or Nankeen, may be con&s;idered as the be&s;t of all the woven goods in China.

<P>They have a kind of tea called <HI>kirpit&s;chnoi t&s;chai,</HI> or brick tea, becau&s;e this tea is pre&s;&s;ed into tables, or cakes, eight or nine inches long, four or five broad, and one inch thick. It is prepared in the mo&s;t northern provinces of China for the Mongols, who, like the
<PB N="84" REF="85">
Burats and Ru&s;&s;ians beyond the Baikal, cannot do without it. Being an a&s;tringent, and mixed with bloody water to form it into cakes, it is very cloying, if taken with milk and butter; or, as the Ru&s;&s;ians do fa&s;ting, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th oil and flour.

<P>Hence we may &s;ee, that furs, hides, &s;ome coar&s;e manufactured goods, lacquered wares, gla&s;s, and great cattle, are tran&s;ported into China; and that raw and manufactured &s;ilk and cotton, tea, tobacco, porcelain, &s;mall-hou&s;e furniture, and toys, are the objects of com|merce with that nation. Eatables and flour were much dearer formerly than at pre&s;ent, and much more &s;ought after by the Chine&s;e.</P>
<P>Some of the poorer Mongols have begun to grow wheat about the river Orchon. They buy &s;till a great many hor&s;es, and large cattle; for the Mongols are but yet poor in cattle, and their hor&s;es are far inferior to the Ru&s;&s;ian hor&s;es. They buy up terriers, ma&s;tiffs, and all kinds of large dogs, with avidity, and pay very dear for them. The watch-trade will no longer do with them, as they &s;eem to have been plentifully &s;up|plied with this article through the European &s;ea-trade
<PB N="86" REF="87">
at Canton; they even &s;ell tho&s;e watches that are out of order at a very moderate price, to the Ru&s;&s;ians at Kjachta.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t advantage which Ru&s;&s;ia reaps from the Chine&s;e trade, is its being able to make a good u&s;e of tho&s;e natural productions of the remote&s;t parts of Si|beria, which would not be worth bringing to Ru&s;&s;ia, e&s;pecially tho&s;e &s;ea-beaver &s;kins, which will not &s;ell in Europe, and are now the very life of Kam&s;chatka commerce; by &s;elling them at high prices to the Chine&s;e, and getting from them tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries which the Ru&s;&s;ians would be otherwi&s;e obliged to pur|cha&s;e at an expen&s;ive rate, and to the di&s;advantage of their balance in trade. The revenue of Ru&s;&s;ia is very much increa&s;ed by the Kjachta trade, by the duties on goods &s;old into China, and brought from thence. In the year 1770, the cu&s;tom duties at Kjachta amounted to no le&s;s than 550,000 rubles, 128,750l. &s;terling; and in both en&s;uing years, not much le&s;s. The principal goods are &s;ettled by a tariff; tho&s;e not &s;o &s;ettled, are &s;ome, few furs, cattle, and victuals, which pay 23 per cent.; Ru&s;&s;ian manufactured goods, 18 per cent.; all forts of &s;ables, 19 per cent.; looking-gla&s;&s;es, 16 rubles per cwt.: and be&s;ides this, all goods pay one ruble per cwt. to &s;upport the cu&s;tomhou&s;e and its officers, and &s;ome articles 7 per cwt. for the &s;aid purpo&s;e. The fol|lowing goods are free of cu&s;toms in going out of the kingdom, writing-paper, Ru&s;&s;ian lacquers, colours,
<PB N="87" REF="88">
fruit, brandy, and all its preparations; and the follow|ing are admitted into the kingdom duty free, raw and coloured cotton, gla&s;s beads, fal&s;e pearls, white lead, fans, needles, pre&s;erved ginger, and other confectiona|ry, rice, dogs, mu&s;ical and other in&s;truments, china, earthen wares, enamelled things, and a variety of fur|niture and ornaments.</P>
<P>Formerly there was a private trade carried on by the crown in caravans, which carried into China all fine furs, &s;ables, black and grey foxes, blue and black ice-foxes, otters, beavers; and, among other arti|cles, brought back tobacco; but the&s;e caravans that formerly went to Peking, are di&s;continued, and the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants may deal in all the above articles, carrying them out, without interruption, from any private trade, except ammunition, gold and &s;ilver, &s;tallions, mares, rein-deer, elk-hides, tanned leather, hor&s;e-&s;kins, beaver-hair, pot-a&s;h, re&s;in, and linen yarn; and may bring in every thing, except &s;alt, brandies, poi&s;ons, copper-coins, and rhubarb, which are pro|hibited. Of the la&s;t article, who&s;e purcha&s;e the crown has re&s;erved as its prerogative, nothing has been brought in from China the&s;e two la&s;t years; but a commi&s;&s;ion has been lately &s;igned for its introduction in future. The contractor is a Bucharian, called Ab|du&s;alam, and his &s;on Abdaula. Abdu&s;alam's father was the fir&s;t importer of it at Kjatchta, and monopo|lized the whole. This Bucharian family are from the
<PB N="88" REF="89">
town Selin, &s;ituated &s;outh of Kokonoor (Blue-&s;ea), towards Thibet, and is with all the towns of little Bucharia, &s;ubject to China. The di&s;trict con&s;i&s;ts of high, barren mountains, on which the rhubarb grows, northwards from Selin, as far as Kokonoor, out of the clefts of the rocks. The old, good roots are known by their thick &s;talks; are mo&s;tly dry in April and May. Having dug them out, they &s;crape off the earth, and hang them about on trees in the neighbour|hood, till the gathering &s;ea&s;on is over, when the Tan|gutians (who are the chief rhubarb-gatherers) take them down, and carry them home. The leaves are &s;aid to be round, and to have no very deep inci&s;ions; of cour&s;e, by this de&s;cription, the <HI>rheum palmatum,</HI> is not the genuine rhubarb, but the <HI>rheum compactum;</HI> for I enquired of the Bucharians re&s;pecting the for|mer, and they were unacquainted with the leaves. Perhaps the <HI>rheum undulatum,</HI> which grows with rot|ten roots on &s;ome of the cold and moi&s;t moun|tains of Siberia, may grow al&s;o on the &s;outhern, free and drier mountains of Thibet, and make the noble&s;t rhubarb-roots; and perhaps this, with care, might be properly cultivated in &s;ome parts of Dauria, or on the Jeni&s;ei, by frequent tran&s;planting.</P>
<P>Exportation of the be&s;t rhubarb is prohibited in China (the Mongols call <HI>&s;chara modo,</HI> yellow wood, the Chine&s;e <HI>doncko</HI>), of cour&s;e the trade is a kind of &s;muggling one, effected by bribing the &s;uperior offi|cers,
<PB N="89" REF="90">
and mixing the good roots with the bad. It is brought on camels, in woollen bags, containing rather more than five puds. Its brokage, reception, and pay|ment, is under the regulation of a pen&s;ioned apothecary, in commi&s;&s;ion at Kjachta. All the rhubarb is there brought, and bored through by &s;worn workmen, in pre&s;ence of the Bucharian merchants, &s;craped, and the refu&s;e thrown a&s;ide: the &s;pongy, hollow roots are of no value, the&s;e are not taken; but the good, &s;ound roots are received, weighed, and paid for, as by contract. The refu&s;e is burnt; though it might &s;erve to make extracts and preparations of rhubarb, for the ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P>The Bucharians, at no &s;mall expence of the Empre&s;s, have already twice pre&s;erved rhubarb-&s;eed, but it is unknown to me what &s;pecies of Rheum was produced from the fir&s;t &s;eeds. The la&s;t time when a Greek officer of the rhubarb-commi&s;&s;ion at Kjachta, one Simon Ma|nuelofsyn Skerletof attained &s;eeds from one of his friends a Bucharian, they produced the known <HI>Rheum palmatum;</HI> but &s;ome per&s;ons, who have &s;een the rhu|barb in its native &s;oil, de&s;cribe its leaves quite dif|ferent, as I have mentioned above. Perhaps this me|dical plant comes from more than one &s;pecies of this genus, which may be readily found out by experi|ments. In the la&s;t parcel &s;ent, were &s;ome pieces of milk-white rhubarb, who&s;e efficacy was equal to the be&s;t, but its ta&s;te &s;weeti&s;h. A &s;election is de&s;igned
<PB N="90" REF="91">
to be made of this, and its true nature and properties enquired into.</P>
<P>On the 6th of April, 1772, I had an opportunity to be an eye-witne&s;s of the conduct of the Chine&s;e, during a lunar eclip&s;e, when they idly &s;uppo&s;e the moon is attacked by a dragon. At night the guards of the police at Kjachta made a rattling in the &s;treets every quarter of an hour, and every one might, if he plea&s;ed, have done the &s;ame. This alarm began at du&s;k, &s;oon after the &s;hutting of the town-gates, and continued ince&s;&s;antly, all the time the eclip&s;e la&s;ted. Be&s;ides this noi&s;e made with boards and kettles, the bell and tymbals at the pagoda were &s;ounded, and the barking of dogs, &s;tirred up by this noi&s;e, encrea&s;ed the tumult. The next day, &s;carce a Chine&s;e was to be &s;een in the &s;treets, though at other times in the day, they walk the &s;treets in great numbers; for the 7th of April, was &s;et down in their almanack as an unlucky day, in which no kind of bu&s;ine&s;s was to be done, except bathing. It is indeed remark|able that &s;o keen a nation &s;hould attend &s;o much to almanack prophecies, which, be&s;ides a deal of &s;uper|&s;tition, point out the bu&s;ine&s;s to be done every day. The conceit of delivering the moon from the at|tack of the bad, aerial &s;pirit <HI>Arach Ulla,</HI> by noi&s;e, clamour and firing of guns, might be pardonable in the &s;uper&s;titious and uncivilized Mongols, but it is not agreeable to the u&s;ual prudence and di&s;cretion
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="92">
<HEAD>CHINESE DELIVERING THE MOON.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="91" REF="93">
of the Chine&s;e. Le&s;s pardonable is their fooli&s;h con|duct in ca&s;e of fire, of which there have been late ex|amples in Kjackta: a hou&s;e accidently took fire, and the flames were &s;o rapid as to con&s;ume &s;everal habi|tations. No Chine&s;e would attempt to quench them. They &s;tood in crowds about the fire, and only &s;prinkled it occa&s;ionally with a few drops of water, to appea&s;e the god of the fire, whom they believe &s;elected the&s;e hou&s;es as a &s;acrifice. Had not the Ru&s;&s;ians, on this occa&s;ion, exerted them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t, the whole place probably would have been burnt to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this, I do not &s;ee that the Chi|ne&s;e pay any great reverence to their idols, except that on the days of &s;upplication, which are appointed on the days of the new and full moon of every month, every Chine&s;e goes once into the temple, and with|out taking off his cap, lays his hands together be|fore his face, bowing five times to every pagod, and touching with his forehead the pede&s;tal on which the pagod or Burchan &s;tands, and then goes away. On high fe&s;tivals, &s;uch as their new-year's-day, which, like the Mongols, they call the <HI>white</HI> day, and which is that which falls on the new moon in February, and con|tinues the whole month, they hoi&s;t flags before their temples, &s;erve up on the pagod-tables, a great deal of provi&s;ion, which the prie&s;ts con&s;ume at night, in the &s;ide-rooms of the fore-court, and in honour of the idols, exhibit daily, on the theatre I have mentioned
<PB N="92" REF="94">
a comedy, &s;atyri&s;ing generally unju&s;t judges and magi&s;|trates. They have al&s;o, at this time, many other en|tertainments, but neverthele&s;s do not neglect their bu|&s;ine&s;s; indeed, this month is allowed by the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants to be the be&s;t of the whole year for trade, becau&s;e the Chine&s;e are then very eager to buy and &s;ell, on account of the happy prophecies with which their almanacks are filled during this month.</P>
<P>On the 8th of April a Mongalian Tai&s;cha, or prince, arrived at Kjachta, as an amba&s;&s;ador <HI>(bo&s;chka),</HI> or commi&s;&s;ioner. His arrival was made known the night before by the Chine&s;e Surgut&s;chei; for Kjachta has al&s;o &s;uch a chief director of the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants, and called by the &s;ame name. The Surgut&s;chei of Kjachta received him early in the morning at his hou&s;e, where he equipped him, after breakfa&s;t, with a proper e&s;cort of &s;oldiers and hor&s;es to conduct him &s;afe to Selengin&s;kaja. He came from the Mongalian head-quarters, <HI>Urga,</HI> on the river Tola, and was &s;ent merely to &s;urrender &s;ome poor Tangutians, who were under the protection of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire, and had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the limits in winter, to a di&s;tance of 15 miles, for the &s;ake of hunting, and had the misfor|tune to fall into a crowd of Mongalian hunters, who took them pri&s;oners. Trifling as this offence may ap|pear, the Chine&s;e think &s;o much of it, that they will on &s;uch occa&s;ions &s;end a legate, or deputy, as far as Irkuzkaja, to make heavy complaints for &s;uch an u&s;ur|pation,
<PB N="93" REF="95">
of right, in encroaching on their boundaries. This legate, his &s;ecretary, and two other Mongols who accompanied him, wore, as badges of di&s;tinction, and being on public bu&s;ine&s;s, a peacock's feather hang|ing down from the hind part of their caps. The but|ton of the legate's cap was white chry&s;tal, tho&s;e of his companions red gla&s;s.</P>
<P>On the 9th of April I le&s;t Kjachta at night, and re|turned to T&s;chikoi, where the Mongalian high-prie&s;t promi&s;ed to meet me, and &s;hew me the temples. I reached that place the next morning, and &s;aw here a &s;pecies of duck, not yet de&s;cribed by naturali&s;ts, with beautiful, vari-coloured, &s;cythe feathers in their wings <HI>(anas falcata),</HI> which &s;pend the winter in China, and the &s;ummer on the Daurian rivers, building their ne&s;ts on the Lena, and Jeni&s;ei, and &s;oaring in little flocks, with a whi&s;tling and &s;hrilling noi&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 10th, in the afternoon, I was enabled to con|tinue my return to Selengin&s;kaja. On the road we were benighted; the unexperienced drivers having driven us out of our way. On my arrival at Selen|gin&s;kaja, the river Selenga was almo&s;t free from ice; but it &s;hut up the T&s;chikoi and Chilok, which la&s;t river was not open till the 20th of April. The &s;un, how|ever, was &s;o warm, as to cover with green and bloom the heights &s;ituated in the &s;outh. On the 13th of April we &s;aw the fir&s;t wind-flowers <HI>(anemone pul&s;atilla),</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="96">
which &s;prung abundantly from the &s;and, and increa&s;ed amazingly. On the 20th appeared the fir&s;t flowers of <HI>Potentilla &s;ubacaulis,</HI> which is the mo&s;t abundant plant in the &s;andy plains, who&s;e leaves under the &s;now, con|tinue green, and become the fir&s;t food of the hungry flocks of the Burats. Their &s;heep devour in equal quantities the dry leaves of <HI>Veronica incana,</HI> and both &s;pecies of the &s;harp wind-&s;lower, which have a purga|tive property among the cattle, and often cures them of the winter itch; but their effect on the &s;kin of the human body is the rever&s;e, and &s;eems to be &s;o corro|&s;ive as to rai&s;e bli&s;ters.</P>
<P>Leaving a &s;tudent in Selengin&s;kaja to collect the vernal plants, I pur&s;ued my way to Udin&s;kaja, ac|companied by Mr. Sokolof, my draught&s;man and hunt&s;man; but did not go the u&s;ual road to this place along the Selenga, and the mountains that run along the &s;ide of that river, but cho&s;e a bye-way, in order to take a view of the iron ore di&s;covered on the Kui|tun, with which the &s;miths of this place &s;upply the whole di&s;trict of Selengin&s;kaja, with iron and &s;teel. I met in my way there with a number of &s;ine, &s;ky-blue magpies <HI>(corvus cyanus)</HI> with black heads, and very long tails, who come with the approach of &s;pring from Mongalia and China, and build their ne&s;ts on the Se|lenga, Onon, and Argun. Common as this bird is we were not able to &s;hoot one, out of the numerous crowds we &s;aw, owing to their wonderful and frequent
<PB N="95" REF="97">
change of flight. Stretching away from the Selen|ga, we cro&s;&s;ed a &s;tony &s;and-mountain, and reached, on the 23d of April, in a deep valley, the river Chi|lok, which had been only two days free from ice, and was very much &s;wolen. Whil&s;t they prepared the ferry, we pa&s;&s;ed the night upon the &s;hore, near a good fire; a dark night, and a little rain and wind, rendering our pa&s;&s;age over the river impracticable till the next day, when my waggons were brought on barges, one after the other, to Chilok&s;kaja, which con&s;i&s;ts of 30 habitations, of which two thirds are co|loni&s;ts of Polanders, &s;ettled here about &s;ix years ago. They cultivate buck-wheat; have their land given them, and grow plenty of water-melons; the &s;ituation to the &s;outh being warm, and the ground &s;andy. The river Chilok, which is here very broad, is &s;o &s;hallow in &s;ummer, as in many places to be fordable. There are a number of villages erected along this river, and colonized with Poles, who have mixed with &s;ome few of the natives.</P>
<P>We left the Chilok, cro&s;&s;ed a mountain, and came to Tarbagantei&s;kaja, on the river Tarbagantei, pa&s;&s;ing &s;everal villages in our road. The population of this di&s;trict amounts to 309 pea&s;ants and 466 new Poli&s;h coloni&s;ts, all governed by Wybornei or elders cho&s;en by the villages, and re&s;ident in Targaban|tei&s;kaja. From this place we travelled up the Kuit|tun, which &s;prings from wild, barren mountains, truly
<PB N="96" REF="98">
de&s;erving this appellation; for there is not a green leaf to be &s;een in the whole di&s;trict. The hollow places or depre&s;&s;ions had almo&s;t every where flowers. Probably the &s;altne&s;s of the &s;oil may be the real cau&s;e of its cold nature, increa&s;ed by an adjacent woody and high mountain. Though there are coloni&s;ts here al&s;o, they cannot bring either &s;lax, hemp, buck|wheat, peas, or wheat to ripen; but the indu&s;trious Polanders try every means, and are not di&s;pirited.</P>
<P>Dunging the land on the&s;e mountains is of no u&s;e; &s;ome Polanders have tried it on turnep-fields, but it was found to wither the corn. Some of the inhabi|tants keep a great many &s;heep of the Mongalian breed, with black heads; the ewes without horns. They al&s;o keep a great number of goats, who&s;e furs are here an important article. The flocks of the&s;e people &s;eed in &s;ummer with tho&s;e of the Burats, who will not ad|mit a horned he-goat among the females, that the off|&s;pring may not have horns to wound each other. Some of the Burats a&s;&s;ured me, incredible as it is, that one he-goat was able to &s;erve 60 females in one day, and render them fertile. The Kalmucks here told me the &s;ame. Among their lambs, many have fine, curled &s;kins; and many of this breed are fold at a great price to the Chine&s;e. The Poli&s;h coloni&s;ts, according to a cu&s;tom in their own country, in order to curl their &s;leece, lace the lambs, as &s;oon as dropped, tight up in linen, and wet them the next day with
<PB N="97" REF="99">
warm water; in which condition they leave them three or four weeks under the ewe, till they think their tender &s;leece is &s;ufficiently curled; letting the &s;trings loo&s;er at different periods, as they find them grow; and when the lamb becomes too big to keep it thus &s;wathed up, they kill it for the &s;ake of the &s;kin.</P>
<P>The woods about the Kuitun con&s;i&s;t of fir, and on the highe&s;t parts, of larches, quite covering the ad|jacent mountain, which abounds with elks, and other game, and is full of iron ore. In the neighbourhood of this place, near the brook Kat&s;cherga, are the re|mains of a gold-mine, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome, tolerably deep &s;hafts; but as the lode &s;oon di&s;continued, it has been de&s;erted the&s;e 10 years. About five miles from this mine runs another mountain ea&s;tward along the Kat|&s;cherga, where the ground is richly coloured with ochre, the vicinity of iron ores. The iron-mine has been worked, but, not finding the ore in any great quantities, has been left to private &s;miths, who have never been mole&s;ted, nor the duty of 10 rubles for each hand-bla&s;t, demanded of them. The&s;e &s;miths here dig iron, &s;upply the whole di&s;trict of Selengin&s;ka|ja with it, and get near a ruble per pud at the fir&s;t hand. Quantities of ore lie above ground, and is gathered by the pea&s;ants in autumn, before the &s;now falls, when the ground is frozen, and carried to their
<PB N="98" REF="100">
hou&s;es. One man will often collect more than 50 puds in a day.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed the Uda on the 26th of April in the &s;ame ferry-boat in which we pa&s;&s;ed the Selenga, and arrived early at Udin&s;koi, where, on account of &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;topped till next day. This place is &s;i|tuated on a point of land, formed by the union of the Uda with the Selenga, and has now a new-built &s;tone church and two wooden ones. It is fortified with a timber wall, has four towers and one gate. Behind the town is a fine, new-built granary, which &s;upplies the Daurian &s;ilver-huts with corn. Here live &s;ome &s;ub&s;tantial merchants, trading chiefly in cattle, Bura|tian lamb-&s;kins, and Daurian grey furs, of which they &s;end annually 3 or 400,000 pieces to Kjachta. Udin|&s;koi, and other, little adjacent places, are well &s;ituated for the tran&s;port of &s;alt and corn to the Daurian huts, and the lead brought here from thence.</P>
<P>Near Udin&s;koi begins the great, high road to Nert|&s;chin&s;kaja, that has a ver&s;t-&s;tone (every ver&s;t is three quarters of a mile) like our mile-&s;tones; but has no where any hedges, and is entirely left to nature, be|cau&s;e this road is chiefly u&s;ed in winter for tran&s;port|ing goods, and other public bu&s;ine&s;s, when the brooks are frozen over. From Udin&s;koi we rode through a &s;andy fir-wood to the brook Bere&s;ofka, and then came to a dry, narrow &s;lope, above 150 miles in length,
<PB N="99" REF="101">
with little variation, except that of being &s;ometimes intercepted with brooks, which flow into the Uda, has the Uda on the left, and a chain of mountains on the right. The &s;tations from Udin&s;koi to T&s;chitin|&s;kaja are well &s;upplied by the Chorinzian Burats. Each is obliged to keep 50 hor&s;es and &s;ome camels in readine&s;s, for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who travel on the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the &s;tate, and for the tran&s;porting of goods. Here and there is a Co&s;&s;ack officer, to command and regulate the&s;e po&s;t-&s;tations; and the intendant-general of the whole re&s;ides at Udin&s;koi. Here I &s;aw, for the fir&s;t time, the manner in which the Burats broke in young hor&s;es for draught. They have but few, tame hor&s;es, one of which they put into the &s;hafts of each waggon; but &s;hould they have more waggons than they have hor&s;es u&s;ed to harne&s;s, they will force wild hor&s;es to draw. The tame one being put into the &s;hafts, a wild hor&s;e is placed on each &s;ide, and girt over the &s;addle with a double rope, in which there is a &s;hort club; then la&s;hing another double rope on the waggon, they mount the hor&s;e, and place him &s;o near the waggon, that they can wind the rope fixed to the waggon round the club on the &s;addle; thus will the young, wild, hor&s;e run along-&s;ide the tame one till he is tired, when they have others, following the waggon, ready to relieve him.</P>
<P>Near the &s;econd Buratian po&s;t is a lake, on who&s;e &s;andy borders lies a great deal of white, nitrous, bitter
<PB N="100" REF="102">
&s;alt, which the Burats fetch under the name of <HI>chud&s;hir,</HI> and boil it in their tea, to make it thicker. Not every bitter &s;alt will plea&s;e them for this purpo&s;e, but that only who&s;e ta&s;te is urinous and alkaline; and tho&s;e who inhabit the mountains, and cannot get this &s;alt, u&s;e &s;harp birch-a&s;hes <HI>(&s;chulta)</HI> as a &s;ub&s;titute.</P>
<P>In a Buratian tent, of which there were &s;ome here, was a young, Chorinzian &s;orcere&s;s <HI>(Udugun),</HI> whom I ordered to attend me in her magic dre&s;s; but I found her &s;o un&s;killed in her art, that the tricks &s;he played are not worth repeating: her dre&s;s &s;hall be de&s;cribed below. Her magic drum was carried after her by her hu&s;band, who&s;e office was to beat it. When &s;he re|turned, the proprietor of the habitation took her crutches from her, and placed them over the door by rai&s;ing the felt roof.</P>
<P>After travelling about 76 miles further, where the river Onon branches into three arms, and where I &s;topped on the 29th at Lo&s;&s;iowo Simowic, and &s;ent for fome &s;orcerers; I vi&s;ited the Damba, who re&s;ides in the neighbourhood, and is the head of the mo&s;t nume|rous, Chorinzian tribe. No &s;orcerer would appear, un|der a pretence that they were gone to &s;ome di&s;tant parts to practi&s;e their magic art. The Chorinzian Burats, who inhabit the country between the Chilok and Bai|kal, and beyond the mountains, on both &s;ides the In|goda to the Onon, con&s;i&s;t of eleven tribes belonging
<PB N="101" REF="103">
to the regency of Nert&s;chin&s;kaja, and pay their Ja&s;&s;ak, or tribute, in furs. Mo&s;t of them are rank heathens, devoted to their magicians; yet the prie&s;ts of Lama, who&s;e zeal for conver&s;ion is uncommonly great, en|deavour to &s;pread among them their better &s;uper&s;ti|tion, which contains, however, &s;ome moral doctrine. They have already among them a Ge&s;hul, with 26 common Lamas, or prie&s;ts, &s;ome nobles or Sai&s;&s;angs, and a Tai&s;cha or prince, followers of Lamai&s;m.</P>
<P>In my way to a mine, at the di&s;tance of 11 miles, on the 30th of April, I &s;topped at the tents of the Buratian &s;ai&s;&s;ang, Schantan, to a&s;k him for a guide; but in hopes, at the &s;ame time, of meeting with a famous, Chorinzian &s;orcerer. Di&s;appointed of my latter object, I went directly to the metallic mine about &s;even miles fur|ther on, called the Mungut mine. The ores here con|&s;i&s;t of compact, ma&s;&s;ive lead-blinde, containing per pud about &s;even pounds of lead, and one dram of &s;ilver, and al&s;o an alloy of copper, of which more than 12,000 puds have been dug.</P>
<P>It is de&s;igned to erect, by degrees, in this whole road to Nert&s;chin&s;kaja, Ru&s;&s;ian &s;tation-villages, in order to relea&s;e the Burats from the obligation they at pre&s;ent lie under of furni&s;hing hor&s;es to travellers. About a mile north-we&s;t of the village Pogromna is a mineral &s;pring, which, if largely drank of, cau&s;es a kind of deafne&s;s and vomiting, and is u&s;ed by the
<PB N="102" REF="104">
Burats again&s;t various, inward complaints with great &s;ucce&s;s: but it has proved mortal to &s;ome Ru&s;&s;ians who have immoderately u&s;ed it in &s;evere di&s;tempers. I rode to the place, with an intent to examine into it, but the &s;pring being frozen over, I was obliged to de|fer it till my return. About the &s;pring were many dry bu&s;hes &s;tuck in the ground, and left by the Burats, after having drank the water.</P>
<P>Six miles from the Pogromna, the Burats of the tribe of Scharazkaja have a po&s;t-&s;tation. Here I or|dered a Chorinzian &s;orcere&s;s, who lived in the neigh|bourhood, to be &s;ent for, in order to &s;ee &s;ome of her magic arts. Her name was Labant&s;ika; &s;he came, ac|companied by her hu&s;band and two other Burats, each of whom carried a magic drum. She told me &s;he had not the full number of her drums, for that on fea&s;t-days &s;he u&s;ed nine. She her&s;elf carried two crutches, <HI>(&s;orbi);</HI> each of which was ornamented at top with a hor&s;e's head, and had many little bells <HI>(holbuga)</HI> about her. With the &s;ame kind of bells in bunches was her leather-garment full. From her &s;houlder to the ground hung down about 30 black and white &s;erpents <HI>(nutchal)</HI> made of vari-coloured pieces of fur, and furs of wea&s;els and ferrets fa&s;tened one to another, like rib|bands. Among the &s;erpents, one at the end was di|vided into three parts, which &s;he called <HI>Mogoi,</HI> and which above all things mu&s;t not be omitted in their magic dre&s;s. Her cap was covered with an iron
<PB N="103" REF="105">
ca&s;que, with three branching horns on each &s;ide, like tho&s;e of a deer. She was at no lo&s;s to play off &s;ome pieces of witchcraft, though it was broad day, and &s;eemed &s;killed in her profe&s;&s;ion. She began with di|vinations, &s;low in the beginning, but violent after|wards; and began to leap and roar in her incanta|tions, at the &s;ound of the magic drums, in which &s;he was accompanied by the Burats, who formed a circle round her. During the invocation the &s;orcere&s;s &s;eem|ed to be convul&s;ed, half-&s;wooning, and putting often her hand over her face, and thus concluded. During her fir&s;t &s;ongs &s;he feigned to run out of doors, but was prevented by two Burats, who &s;tood at the door. After many other &s;uch-like fanta&s;tic ravings, &s;he ran always &s;inging towards three Burats, who were &s;itting with their drums on the left &s;ide of the hut. Once &s;he took her crutches in both hands, and jumped, leaping as it were out of the &s;moke-hole, as if &s;he wanted to draw the aerial &s;pirits with her crutches into the hut. Afterwards &s;he &s;eemed gay, and begged to have que&s;tions put to her, which &s;he an&s;wered &s;inging, and &s;winging her&s;elf backwards and forwards. At la&s;t &s;he a&s;ked for &s;ome brandy, and prophe&s;ied, from be|hind the liquor, that I &s;hould be happy, and travel much farther by &s;ea, and with this &s;he ended.</P>
<P>I have given this woman as an in&s;tance of the pre|&s;ent art and dre&s;&s;es of Buratian &s;orcere&s;&s;es, in order that my readers may compare them with tho&s;e of
<PB N="104" REF="106">
other nations, who&s;e &s;orceries have been, or may be related. (See the Lapland magician, &amp;c. and judge between them.)</P>
<P>On May the 5th, at day-break, a great deal of wet &s;now &s;ell, which, with the &s;tony and miry roads, made our way almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able, and extremely toil|&s;ome. We could &s;carce travel half a mile without &s;topping to give the Buratian hor&s;es, which &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t only of hair and bones, time to recover breath and &s;trength. With the greate&s;t pain, however, and lo&s;s of time, we pa&s;&s;ed the Uda, and crept over ano|ther mountain, covered with larches; and late in the afternoon found our&s;elves at the di&s;tance only of 12 miles from the place we left at break of day. We were fortunate, however, to meet here with a de&s;erted winter-hut, with a &s;love, but without roof, door, or window, where we &s;lept, and were &s;heltered from the &s;now; but our greate&s;t pains were to find wood under the &s;now, which lay an ell deep. We collected all the &s;uperfluous wood of the hut, and thus made a fire; but it occa&s;ioned &s;o in&s;upportable a &s;moke, that we were obliged to &s;tay without in the &s;now, till the wood was nearly burnt out. Two of my waggons were not &s;o happy as to reach this wretched &s;moke-hole, but were obliged to pa&s;s the night in different places of the wood, though we &s;ent back all the hor&s;es we had which were able to move.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="107">Next morning, after a chilling night, our de&s;art-habitation looked like a field of battle. Near it &s;tood our hor&s;es and waggons, of which we had 20, but 11 of them having died in the night, with the fro&s;t and hunger, lay &s;tretched out on the &s;now, and had at|tracted all the crows and ravens of the fore&s;t, who&s;e cawings rendered the place &s;till more dreadful. A &s;pent hor&s;e was &s;et at liberty from a waggon, and it fell without looking out for a birch-bu&s;h, which is the winter-food of the Buratian hor&s;es in this di&s;trict. In our wretchedne&s;s, however, the birds of the fore&s;t, which, &s;timulated by hunger, gathered about our hut, gave me no little plea&s;ure. We threw rubbi&s;h out of the hut, which &s;till further decoyed them, &s;o that we could &s;hoot a great number of rare birds through the window-holes. Here I got &s;even, new &s;pecies of unknown birds, &s;ome of which I never could meet with afterwards, as they inhabit the innermo&s;t and thicke&s;t part of the fore&s;t, and are very &s;hy. The&s;e were, <HI>Turdus ruficollis, &amp; Alpinus, Motacilla Cyanura, Em|heriza minuta, ru&s;lica, Chry&s;ocilla et Spodocephala.</HI> To|wards night we found &s;everal, little birds in the &s;now, killed by hunger and the fro&s;t, and a little &s;pecies of blue-tailed hedge-&s;parrow <HI>(Motac. Cyanurus)</HI> which, though extremely &s;hy, flew into our hut for &s;helter, and hopped boldly about.</P>
<P>It was a joyful circum&s;tance that the change of the moon on the 6th of May brought a &s;erene day, which
<PB N="106" REF="108">
gave us hopes of deliverance from our wretched her|mitage, where we were blocked up by the &s;now, and who&s;e cold and dripping waters became more and more in&s;upportable. I di&s;patched early in the morn|ing an interpreter on hor&s;eback to get fre&s;h hor&s;es from the next po&s;t-&s;tation, &s;ituated on the great road, at the di&s;tance of 11 miles. They were brought in the evening, but almo&s;t as poor and mi&s;erable as tho&s;e which lay dead before us. We were able, however, this day to fetch the waggons left behind us; and, lying another night in this hovel, very &s;carce in provi&s;ions, the next morning we proceeded on, up to our knees in &s;now, dirt, and water, in order to le&s;&s;en the load of the hor&s;es through the mountainous wood. Not|with&s;tanding this help, we could not get further with the empty waggons than four miles and a half, and were obliged to put them out at the next birch-ground, to give them time to refre&s;h them&s;elves with birch-twigs. But with all this, we &s;hould not have been able to have got much further, had not the Bu|rats &s;ent us from Scha&s;cha-noor fre&s;h hor&s;es and ca|mels. The latter, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, are put before the waggons, and a felt, rolled up, and tied between the poles or &s;hafts, is to lie as a yoke betwixt the ca|mel's neck and the hunch on his back. Thus did the camels draw us, though &s;lowly, yet without &s;topping, through the vallies overflown with mud and &s;now-water. Some camels, however, are &s;o ob&s;tinate as not to draw in different &s;pots; nor can they be made
<PB N="107" REF="109">
with the greate&s;t blows, nor with the rope drawn through their no&s;es. This day we cro&s;&s;ed the Schi|birtu, and two brooks which flow into the Konda. From the Schibirtu to the Konda, the wood is inter|cepted by a &s;teep track of rocks, from which the &s;now-water rolled in &s;uch torrents, as to re&s;emble &s;o many rivers, and &s;welled the Konda &s;o much, that we could not pa&s;s it without a bridge; and as we could not con&s;truct one that day, and our po&s;t-hor&s;es and ca|mels longed for re&s;t, we &s;topped at &s;ome Buratian tents that were there erected.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the bridge was fini&s;hed next day over the deepe&s;t arm of the river, I ordered the waggons to cro&s;s, and we did the &s;ame on the camels; but &s;carce|ly had we reached the oppo&s;ite bank, but the ri&s;ing water dragged away the bridge. With much diffi|culty we travelled on; every thing &s;eemed overflown with a general flood; the &s;malle&s;t brooks were &s;o deep, that we dur&s;t not pa&s;s them, had we not con|trived a peculiar kind of <HI>bridge of di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> which was many times afterwards very u&s;eful to us. We &s;ought, for example, for a &s;pot where the brook was the nar|rowe&s;t, and its banks &s;teep; then felled down two &s;mooth fir-trunks, and &s;ome Burats, who were to ford the brook on hor&s;eback, dragged them acro&s;s with ropes; and as the&s;e re&s;ted on the two oppo&s;ite banks, our waggons could pa&s;s expeditiou&s;ly on them; the axle trees, which in this country go round with the
<PB N="108" REF="110">
wheels, turning on the&s;e trunks, with the wheels and hor&s;es in the water. After having cro&s;&s;ed &s;everal, frozen rivulets in this manner, we came at la&s;t to more even ground, and got on pretty well: but I mu&s;t not omit mentioning a new &s;pecies of ducks which I met with in this road <HI>(Anas hi&s;trionica)</HI> which inhabit the ea&s;t of Siberia only, on the mountain-lakes and torrents; and as they &s;eek for the wilde&s;t rock-waters, the Ru&s;&s;ians call them <HI>Kamenu&s;chki,</HI> that is, Cliff-ducks.

<P>On the 9th of May we reached the bottom of the partition mountain, which divides Dauria from Sibe|ria. This mountain ri&s;es gradually with a gentle a&s;|cent, till we come to that &s;teep, rocky part, which, by the name of Jableni-Daba, &s;eparates the brooks of the Baikal and Lena from tho&s;e of the Amur. This mountain, which is 15 miles broad, con&s;i&s;ts of granite rock, and extends it&s;elf from the Mongalian boun|daries, beyond which it runs between the T&s;chikoi and Onon, with many windings, uninterrupted to the Ea&s;tern ocean. Its height appears moderate, for there are here and there &s;ide-mountains, which &s;ur|pa&s;s it in loftine&s;s; Come who&s;e &s;ummits during the whole &s;ummer are covered with &s;now, though it melts very &s;oon on the partition-mountain; but the rapid

&s;treams of the waters which run from it to &s;eas &s;o re|mote, are an evident proof of its loftine&s;s. It is pe|culiar that no regular rock-&s;tratum is to be met with in the white mountain. The pieces of rock lay, with|out regularity, large and &s;mall together, mo&s;tly over-grown with mo&s;s, in which, between the cliffs, &s;ome few trees grew, and the wheels of our waggons re|ceived great damage. It would be in vain to mend this road, as the &s;now-waters, which have deprived the&s;e ancient mountains long ago of their earthy co|vering, would &s;oon &s;poil the whole. The whole mountain is burnt up, and the trees, which are larches and birch-bu&s;hes, grow only on the ea&s;t &s;ide, with a few pines and furs along the brooks. We pa&s;&s;ed this mountain fortunately; but, it being eight miles from the top to the next po&s;t-&s;tation, could not reach it be|fore night; and as at the bottom the road was bad, and our hor&s;es fatigued, we took up our lodging in the wood, and reached the &s;tation the next morning, where I waited till the 10th of May for &s;ome of my people, who had &s;topped in Schak&s;cha-noor, for the &s;ake of hunting.</P>
<P>On the 11th I continued my journey for Tit&s;chin|&s;koi. The country here became more open and agreeable; and only the highe&s;t mountains are cover|ed with wood. The vallies are gravelly, and among the &s;mall &s;tones is a great deal of quartz and milk-white Chalcedon-like pebbles. I &s;topped at a village
<PB N="110" REF="112">
on the river Ingoda, five miles &s;hort of Tit&s;chin&s;koi, and ordered a raft to be con&s;tructed, in order to ride down the river, as the road along-&s;ide of it was quite overflown. On the warmer mountains about the In|goda, the larch-trees began to put out their leaves; the birches were dropping their juice, and the <HI>Rhodo|dendrum Dauricum</HI> &s;hewed its purple bloom.</P>
<P>On the 13th we got upon the rafts, pa&s;&s;ed Tit&s;chin|&s;koi, and on the 14th landed 37 miles below it, near the village Charamangut<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Ru&s;&s;ians are vulgarly called by the Burats <HI>Manguts,</HI> which means a Goblin, and is a la&s;ting mark of the old opinion the Burats entertained of them.

to their cells; it being often found that one provi&s;ion-cave has contained eight or ten pounds of cleaned roots; and each ne&s;t has three or four or more &s;uch caves. The&s;e mice often dig their ne&s;ts at a great di&s;tance from the cave; and where they are in great numbers, we &s;ee little holes in the turf, from whence they took out the root. They clean them on the &s;pot, and then drag them to their home. In order to convey them the ea&s;ier, they make flat, little paths in the turf, on all &s;ides, from the opening of their &s;ub|terranean magazine. The roots they collect are the <HI>Sangui&s;orba</HI> (in Tungu&s;e <HI>Schuddu</HI>); the <HI>Polygonum vi|viparum,</HI> (in Tungu&s;e <HI>Mykir</HI>); and a kind of a mea|dow-plant, with flowers &s;imilar to the wind-flower, <HI>Chaerophyllum temulum;</HI> which, from its &s;tupefying poi|&s;on, and dangerous effects, cannot be eaten by any human being. The Tungu&s;e &s;ay the mice gather the&s;e roots, in order to intoxicate them&s;elves on their fea&s;t-days; and indeed this pernicious, little root, re|&s;embling a turnep, is devoured by the mice with the other roots.

They are the peculiar object of the Tungu&s;e, who, by plun|dering the cells of the&s;e field-mice, often live during a whole winter. When the&s;e animals have filled their caves in autumn, the Tungu&s;e go in &s;earch of their holes, which they call <HI>Urgan,</HI> and feel with their foot, or the handle of their &s;pade, where the turf is &s;oft, and &s;eldom fail to hit upon the ne&s;t, or &s;ome provi|&s;ion-cell. They immediately know all for&s;aken holes; and when they &s;ee the little paths not recently made hollow, the earth-holes not cleaned, and no traces of digged roots in their neighbourhood, they pa&s;s them by, looking for the well-&s;tored caves of the fugitive mou&s;e, and, pulling out the poi&s;onous roots, carry away the remainder. The Sangui&s;orba root is in form like the former, but not &s;o tough, nor &s;o white, and, may ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the black Sangui|&s;orba, which the Tungu&s;e are fond of drinking, as tea. The mice &s;ave their lives at lea&s;t from the&s;e robbers; but the wild boars, who live on roots, as do the Tun|gu&s;e, and are their rivals in this re&s;pect, &s;earch dili|gently for the&s;e Urgans or ne&s;ts, and often devour their benefactors and provi&s;ions together.</P>

commanding-officer was burnt down la&s;t year, and is not yet rebuilt. As the number of the working garri|&s;on is but &s;mall, the fortifications are not yet com|pleted. The common dwellings, of which 10 new hou&s;es for coloni&s;ts make the greate&s;t number, will, according to the plan laid down, when they are in|crea&s;ed, form a regular &s;uburb without the fort, which was erected to quarter a number of light troops, to keep the country free from &s;everal gangs of fugitive Mongols, famous in this country for robberies com|mitted by them as far as the Ru&s;&s;ian boundary. At that time 400 Tungu&s;e entered the Co&s;&s;ack &s;ervice, who, with as many Co&s;&s;acks from Nert&s;chin&s;kaja, oc|cupy the frontier guard on the Onon and Argun, and on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the partition-mountains.

On the Daurian line half of the&s;e troops are divided on the frontier guards, each commanded by a corporal of militia; the other half is together in troops; and have their quarters, at proper di&s;tances, in order to be ready, and in motion when required.

The&s;e chaces are the chief delights of the Mongols and the Daurian-&s;tep Tungu&s;e. The Mongols call it <HI>Ablachu,</HI> and the Ru&s;&s;ians <HI>Oblawa.</HI> They are chiefly perform|ed in an open di&s;trict, towards a mountain-river or wood; e&s;pecially in autumn, when the hor&s;es are &s;trong. Parties of 100 or 200 men, who ride well, and have &s;everal hor&s;es, are all armed with bows and arrows, and each has a &s;kilful hound, thus making a pack. They elect a chief, who regulates the chace as long as it continues; di&s;patching in the morning, where they mean to throw off, three or four &s;harp-&s;ighted men, who are to look out for game; then fol|low them, and if the&s;e &s;ee it in flocks, they &s;top till the whole body of hunters join them, giving &s;igns, by turning their hor&s;es to the &s;ide where the game is feeding, and &s;hewing them in the &s;ame manner how they are to divide. After this &s;ignal, the body divides into little parties, di&s;po&s;ing them&s;elves into the form of a large bow, one man not more than 60 or 80 fathoms from another. The end of this moving-bow ap|proaches the place where the game is &s;aid to be, and the hunters hide them&s;elves as much behind the heights as they can, till they have enclo&s;ed it. Then the whole circle draws nearer together, and as &s;oon as the game is aware of their danger, and takes flight, the whole body ru&s;hes after it, full-gallop, drive it to|gether,

When &s;uch an arrow is &s;hot with, it makes a hi&s;&s;ing noi&s;e through the air, and where it falls, makes a broad and mortal wound.</NOTE>. With this weapon the Daurian &s;tep-nations perform regular, eque&s;trian exerci&s;es.

<P>All the rivers which flow through Dauria, and empty into the Amur, are plentifully &s;tocked with fi&s;h, and particularly tho&s;e fi&s;h that are rare in &s;ome Sibe|rian rivers.

Be&s;ides the&s;e, the Onon has common &s;turgeons, Lenki, Taimeni, and a &s;pecies of large <HI>&s;almo oxrynchus,</HI> known in the Baikal by the name of <HI>Mor&s;koi Sig;</HI> crabs, and a variety of &s;mall fi&s;h.

which would be of great value, if large, or cleft-le&s;s pieces could be found.

<P>On the 23d of May they brought me, from the Tungu&s;e chace, antelopes <HI>(Decren)</HI> of various breed and age; and I bu&s;ied my&s;elf the whole day in di&s;&s;ect|ing and de&s;cribing them. What is mo&s;t particular in the&s;e animals, and which no other &s;pecies of antelope has, is, that with the bucks horns the <HI>larynx</HI> al&s;o grows to &s;o enormous a &s;ize in all its parts, that the old ones look as if they had a large wen. They have al&s;o un|derneath the fore-&s;kin of their bellies a wide, oval bag, with a peculiar opening, exactly &s;imilar to the pur&s;e or bag of the Mo&s;chus, except that the antelope's is quite empty. Perhaps it may be filled with &s;ome matter in the brimming &s;ea&s;on; but the above &s;ea&s;on is late in autumn, and they get their young only in June, when the Sanana, or purple-lily is in bloom. Their young, if brought up in hou&s;es, become ex|ceedingly tame, &s;o as to run about the hou&s;e, or a|broad, as they plea&s;e, and will never go away; but, if pur&s;ued by a dog, will fly to the hou&s;e.

<P>I meant to &s;leep, on the 27th of May, in Kubuchai|ku; but, having received intelligence, by an inter|preter I &s;ent on before, that the Tungu&s;e had killed a &s;tep-hor&s;e, I determined to ride the whole night, to &s;ave this rare animal from the corruption of the pre|&s;ent, hot weather. My guides took this night a wrong way on the &s;tep, on which there is no road, but where travellers direct their way by the &s;un. We were al|ready &s;even miles from the fortre&s;s, towards the Mon|galian frontiers, and, &s;eeing the error of my guides, I took out my compa&s;s, and &s;hewed them the direction we were to &s;teer. Before day-break we arrived at Sa&s;|&s;ut&s;chin&s;koi Karaul, where I &s;topped to breakfa&s;t; then ha&s;tened to the guard-&s;tation, Kulu&s;&s;utai, a di&s;|tance of 60 miles, &s;ince I la&s;t &s;lept. Here Mr. Sokolof and I parted, for I di&s;patched him on a tour along the Argun to make his ob&s;ervations on the vegetable king|dom of that di&s;trict.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="122">In the wild &s;teps about the Tarei are continually &s;een, at a di&s;tance, that &s;pecies of wild &s;tep-hor&s;e, called by the Mongols <HI>D&s;higgetei</HI> (long-ear). In the Mongul country, particularly in the wide, waterle&s;s &s;tep of the Gobei they are &s;aid to be met with in large herds; but that within the Ru&s;&s;ian frontiers, &s;ince &s;o many guard-po&s;ts have been erected, &s;eldom any &s;uch herd, headed by an old &s;tallion, and con&s;i&s;ting of from 10 to 30 mares is to be met with; but only a fugi|tive, young &s;tallion or mare, which has run &s;ingly from the Mongalian &s;ide, pur&s;ued by the old ones; and the&s;e are only found on the &s;teps about the Tarei, and the utmo&s;t corner of the di&s;trict of the Argun, near Abagaitu.</P>
<P>The&s;e D&s;higgetei can neither be called hor&s;es nor a&s;&s;es; they are, like mules, between both. Hence it was, that Me&s;&s;er&s;chmed, who fir&s;t ob&s;erved this ani|mal, came to call them fertile mules <HI>(Mulus Dauricus faecundus).</HI> Mules they are not, but a genus of their own, and have a much &s;iner &s;hape than a mule. That kind of &s;tep-a&s;s, called by the we&s;tern Kirgue&s;e <HI>Kulan,</HI> is not to be taken as &s;uch; for the latter, according to the true&s;t accounts, are but wild a&s;&s;es of Onagor&s;of, which inhabit the mountainous &s;teps of We&s;tern Tar|tary, as the D&s;higgetei do the Mongalian de&s;arts. The latter has certain beauties, which render him far pre|&s;erable to the a&s;s. An uncommon, light body, &s;len|der limbs, a wild, fugitive appearance, and fine-co|loured
<PB N="121" REF="123">
hair, are his advantages over the a&s;s. The ears al&s;o are better proportioned than tho&s;e of a mule, and, being livelily erected, &s;uit him well; and, with the&s;e beauties, it may be over-looked that his head is rather heavy, and his hoofs like tho&s;e of an a&s;s. The &s;traight, angular back, and the ugly cow-tail, are it's only de|formities. It's head is clum&s;y, it's brea&s;t large, cor|nered below, and &s;omewhat pre&s;&s;ed together. The back-bone is not like that of a hor&s;e, hollow and round, nor as &s;traight and angular as an a&s;s, but calf-like, bent outwards, or ri&s;ing in the middle, and ob|tu&s;ely angular. The ears are longer than tho&s;e of a hor&s;e, and &s;horter than a mule's. The mane is &s;hort, wild, and perfectly like that of an a&s;s; and &s;o are the tail and hoofs. The brea&s;t and &s;houlders are narrow, and not &s;o fle&s;hy as tho&s;e of a hor&s;e, and the flanks and hind-quarters are rather lean and thin; the limbs &s;light, and tolerably high. The colour is a light-yellow brown; the no&s;e, and the in&s;ide of the legs of a &s;allow-yellow; the mane and tail blacki&s;h; and along the back-bone runs an elegant brown and black &s;tripe, broad along the croup, and &s;lender towards the tail. When the animal &s;tands, it carries its head high; and if running, &s;tretches its no&s;e in the air. That which I had an opportunity to di&s;&s;ect and de&s;cribe at Kulu&s;&s;utai, was a mare, three years old, which was catched &s;ingly, and killed upon the &s;tep. Two young &s;tallions were killed a little be|fore by the Tungu&s;e, and their fle&s;h, which they
<PB N="122" REF="124">
e&s;teem as the greate&s;t dainty of all game, was eaten. This animal had now its long and woolly, winter-hair, which looked &s;omewhat more &s;allow, and was very &s;mooth and &s;hining. The &s;wiftne&s;s of the D&s;higgetei &s;urpa&s;&s;es all imagination, and is therefore become a proverb among the Mongols&mdash;No hor&s;e, ever &s;o &s;wift, can overtake it; it can therefore be only killed from a hidden retreat, where the wind is again&s;t the hunt&s;|man, and when the animal comes within reach of his arms. The mo&s;t numerous rattle-chace would be incompetent to catch them. No &s;ooner does a herd of the&s;e animals &s;ee any thing &s;u&s;picious, for in&s;tance, a hunt&s;man lying, or creeping, on the ground, at a di&s;|tance, than the &s;tallion and guide of the herd runs in a large circle twice or thrice round the object of his fear, and then, with the whole herd, takes his flight. Hence it happens that mares are more &s;eldom killed. If the mares lo&s;e a &s;tallion, the whole herd &s;catters and divides, and thus often fall a prey to the hunters.</P>
<P>Were there a po&s;&s;ibility of taming the&s;e animals, there would not be better cour&s;ers in the world; but their wildne&s;s is not to be overcome. If there had been any means of taming them, the Mongols, and other A&s;iatic nomades, into who&s;e hands &s;o many colts fall, would have effected it. It is remembered that on the&s;e frontiers, many years ago, a Co&s;&s;ack of Nert|&s;chin&s;kaja fed a captive D&s;higgettei colt, and endea|voured, for &s;everal months to tame him; but it re|mained
<PB N="123" REF="125">
wild, and at la&s;t killed it&s;elf by forcibly jump|ing. Yet, with proper prudence and care, other at|tempts might be made with very young foals, caught a few days after they are dropped, which, perhaps, might not be in vain. It would be worth giving a premium to tho&s;e that &s;hould &s;ucceed, as it would be obtaining a new, dome&s;tic animal, that, by its &s;peed, might be very u&s;eful.</P>
<P>Mr. Sokolof left me at Kulu&s;&s;utai, but I remained here till the 31&s;t of May, and was &s;o bu&s;y in de&s;cribing the various, natural curio&s;ities, e&s;pecially of the animal kind, that were brought me, that I had &s;carce time to eat or to &s;leep. The richer the little di&s;trict towards the Argun is, in little lakes and mar&s;hes, the more it abounds in water-&s;owl. There are a great many, not only common, but al&s;o Indian crows <HI>(Ardea Antigone)</HI> and what they call the Numidian Virgin <HI>(Ardea virgo, Demoi&s;elle de Numidie);</HI> al&s;o bu&s;tards of an enormous &s;ize, and cocks, which are called by the Mongols <HI>Sachaltu,</HI> on account of their fine-feathered beards, and having, under the tongue, the opening of a wen-like water-bag, the &s;ize of a large goo&s;e-egg; the bird often weighing above 30 pounds.</P>
<P>In the&s;e &s;teps re&s;ides al&s;o a very remarkable, little animal, which is even more abundantly to be found on the Selenga, known in Dauria by the Mongalian name of <HI>Ogolona.</HI> It has the greate&s;t &s;imilitude to the
<PB N="124" REF="126">
&s;malle&s;t earth-hare <HI>(Lepus pu&s;illus);</HI> and with the cliff|hare <HI>(Lepus alpinus)</HI> which I have de&s;cribed. The difference between the&s;e three little animals is much more than between the common hare and the rabbit. The Daurian earth-hare is about the &s;ize of the cliff|hare, but of a pale-yellowi&s;h, grey colour. Its ears re&s;emble both the other &s;pecies; are large and round, the head obtu&s;e; &s;hort feet, with the u&s;ual divi&s;ions, and no tail. It burrows in the &s;and, like a rabbit, and leaves its holes only about noon or night to feed, which it does on the bark of the Daurian <HI>(Pyrus baccata)</HI> on which account it inhabits the i&s;lands and banks of rivers. In the morning and at night we may hear their &s;hrilling and whi&s;tling voice, where they dwell. Towards autumn, they gather, about their holes, little round heaps, of about one foot in diame|ter, made of all &s;orts of plants; and, with the grey, mountain-&s;peedwell, &s;tuff up all the pa&s;&s;ages to their holes, but fill them again if con&s;umed, and the wea|ther be &s;evere. This animal is the u&s;ual prey for the &s;tep-cat, &s;o common in Dauria.</P>
<P>On the 30th of May I entertained my&s;elf before my departure with a clever, Tungu&s;e witch, who was at a relation's in this neighbourhood. She came, as &s;oon as it was dark, near a fire, lighted before a tent, and &s;ome young lads carried her dre&s;s, magic drums, and crutches; &s;he had al&s;o along with her a great number of young women and girls, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in

&s;inging. Her dre&s;s, which &s;he put over her bare &s;kin before the fire, was &s;imilar to that of the Chorinzian &s;orcere&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> a leather-robe, ornamented with a great many iron, rattling toys, and bra&s;s ornaments; and from it hung down behind, from the &s;houlders, a quan|tity of varied-coloured &s;erpents, or tails, each of which had a little bell. On her cap were leather-horns on|ly, in&s;tead of iron ones, and on her &s;houlders &s;he had al&s;o &s;ome figures of frogs. Her drum was more than an ell in diameter, and was fir&s;t warmed over the fire to give it a deeper &s;ound. She took it fir&s;t in hand her&s;elf, put it down on the north &s;ide of the fire, or|dered the choir of women to &s;it before her in one row, and the men round about in a circle; then began, turning her face to the north, and made her incanta|tions with a terrible voice. At la&s;t &s;he gave her drum to her hu&s;band to beat, and began to leap with the crutches in one hand, then raved, made various con|tortions, during which &s;he pretended to be out of her mind, by hiccoughing, imitating the voice of the cuc|kow, and other odd &s;ounds; and in the end, whil&s;t &s;he was &s;inging, a que&s;tion was read to her, which &s;he pretty well gue&s;&s;ed. After this &s;he a&s;ked for brandy, and being de&s;ired to an&s;wer &s;ome more que&s;tions, re|plied, that &s;he could command but three &s;pirits, one every evening; one of which, &s;he &s;aid, lived towards midnight, one towards morning, and the third towards evening; &s;he could therefore an&s;wer no more than two que&s;tions. She then began her conjurations to|wards

evening, and called upon her aerial &s;pirit, <HI>Da|rold&s;he,</HI> often looking up to the &s;hining moon, with her hands over her eyes, as if &s;he &s;aw &s;omething com|ing from far. When &s;he was to an&s;wer the third que&s;tion, &s;he repeated her magic hymns towards morn|ing, and all the que&s;tions we had made fal&s;e, on pur|po&s;e to deceive her, &s;he gue&s;&s;ed &s;o well, that it a&s;to|ni&s;hed me, and made me almo&s;t &s;u&s;pect my interpreter had told her how to act before-hand. The Tungu&s;e &s;aid &s;he had not been in&s;tructed by any other magi|cian, but formed her&s;elf, and, whil&s;t a girl, had lived a long time in a fooli&s;h, melancholy &s;tate; but the Co&s;|&s;acks a&s;&s;ured me that her ma&s;ter was an old &s;orcerer upon the Onon, to whom it happened that his cloaths were &s;tolen away by &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors of the art travel|ling, at that time, in this di&s;trict; and that &s;ince this, he had left off his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I had now, on the 13th of June, an opportunity of enquiring into the nature of the mineral &s;pring men|tioned before on the brook Pogromna. This well has not been dug more than four or five years, and is &s;imilar, in quality, to the Seltzer water. I &s;hall not determine, from any experiments I made my&s;elf, as the well was not now in perfection; but from the experiments of Mr. Georgi, made the autumn fol|lowing, at my recommendation.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="130">From a variety of experiments then made, by this gentleman, it may be collected, that the mineral &s;pring of Pogromna contains a great deal of aether, a &s;trong mineral alkali, a &s;mall degree of iron, and a &s;till &s;mal|ler quantity of chalk, &s;uch as may be met with in all pure waters, and a very little &s;elenites, which the &s;ul|phureous &s;mell of the re&s;iduum on coals demon&s;trates. To the fir&s;t three ingredients the known efficacy of the water ought to be a&s;cribed; and it may ari&s;e from the &s;uperabundance of aether, that the Ru&s;&s;ian pea|&s;ants who drink this water, as do the Burats, (but im|moderately) as a cure for di&s;orders, or whenever they pa&s;s this way, feel a certain heat, and giddine&s;s of head, which has given to this &s;pring the name of <HI>Pja|naja woda,</HI> i.e. intoxicating water. This effect nei|ther I, nor my people perceived, who drank of it; but afterwards we felt an irritation of the no&s;e, like that excited by wine, or beer, rich with aether.</P>
<P>The Burats u&s;e it again&s;t all di&s;orders, and even to cure lamene&s;s; and come here, annually, to ble&s;s the well with prayers, for &s;even days, three or four times a day. Drinking it renders them very weak, and &s;omewhat &s;everi&s;h; but many find a cure in all kinds of di&s;orders. They know nothing of any per|nicious, or mortal effect it has; and we may readily &s;ee in two ca&s;es related by the Ru&s;&s;ians, that it is only by an immoderate u&s;e of it, preceded by &s;ome di&s;or|ders, that makes it fatal. Round about the wells have
<PB N="128" REF="131">
been hung, on bu&s;hes, all &s;orts of rags, and &s;houlders of &s;heep and oxen-&s;kins, on which were written the names of tho&s;e who had received benefit from the wa|ters, their cure, and the ble&s;&s;ed day of their recovery. Near one well (for there are three or four) &s;tood a long &s;taff, with two cro&s;s &s;ticks, on which hung little boards, with Tangutian prayers, which turned with the wind.</P>
<P>On the 20th of June, at night, I reached Selen|gin&s;kaja, which lies on the right border of the Selen|ga, quite encompa&s;&s;ed with &s;and mountains. In all the I&s;lands of the Selenga, of which there are many, the little, &s;and-bare <HI>(ogelona)</HI> was &s;een in great abun|dance. The Mongol boys, who are fond of roa&s;ting the&s;e little animals, are peculiarly &s;killed in catching them, and call them <HI>alakdaga</HI> (&s;peckled colt). Both Mongols and Burats told me, that the&s;e rare hares do, as they &s;ay the common hedge-hog does in Eng|land, and the large hou&s;e-toad in Ru&s;&s;ia, re&s;pecting cows, and the night-&s;wallow re&s;pecting goats; that is, &s;uck their udders at night. This, however, is certain, that they are &s;een, at night, among the &s;heep-flocks whom they frighten by their jumps.</P>
<P>I now determined to return to Kjachta, partly to give them an account of what I had met with on the frontiers between Ru&s;&s;ia and China, where I had been, and partly to examine into the beautiful, &s;outhern di&s;|tricts
<PB N="129" REF="132">
about the Selenga and T&s;chikoi in this &s;ea&s;on, and to collect the plants that had attained their perfection. I took, therefore, the u&s;ual road to Petropaulof&s;kaja-Krepo&s;t, where is e&s;tabli&s;hed on the upper fron|tier, a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, that collects a duty on all goods carried to Kjachta, and examines all goods and bales brought from thence, that nothing may be carried away without being &s;tamped. For this rea&s;on the &s;ide-roads are &s;topped again&s;t merchants; and the corner be|tween the T&s;chikoi and the Selenga has a barrier. To reach the fortre&s;s, the T&s;chikoi is to be cro&s;&s;ed, which, a little farther downwards, falls into the Se|lenga, from whence the fort took its old name, Strjel|ka, which implies a cape between two united rivers, and agrees well with the former &s;ituation; for it was formerly &s;ituated in the very corner, where both rivers meet. The goods which are brought from Kjachta by land, pa&s;s before this place in barges, and are car|ried down the Selenga, over the Baikal, and then far|ther on, on the Angara and Tungu&s;ka, into the Je|ni&s;ei; and tho&s;e barges arriving from the Angara, over the Baikal, are drawn up the Selenga to this place.</P>
<P>On the 24th of June I left Poworotnoi, the fir&s;t &s;tation on the road to Kjachta, at 15 miles from Selen|gin&s;kaja, on the left, and went &s;traight towards the Se|lenga, to &s;ee a Mongalian hou&s;e of prayer, erected at the common expence of the three Tabungutian tribes; and then went on to Kjachta, the road to which is
<PB N="130" REF="133">
fenced in on both &s;ides with hedges, and where I ar|rived on the 26th. I left it again on the 28th, in order to go to Selengin&s;kaja, which I reached on the 30th of June Two days before, I was a &s;pectator of an extraordinary, pagan wor&s;hip, ordered by the &s;upe|rior Chambo-Lama, out of compliment to me. It con&s;i&s;ted in a formal, &s;olemn ble&s;&s;ing, which he per|formed him&s;elf, and a&s;&s;embled on the occa&s;ion a great number of his clergy.</P>
<P>I was employed &s;ome days in Selengin&s;kaja in col|lecting &s;everal things relative to natural hi&s;tory, and arranging what I had hitherto collected. In the mean time I ordered every thing to be ready for my return to Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, and was thus able to &s;et out for the Baikal on the third of July.</P>
<P>Mr. Bykof, whom I had left in &s;pring about Selen|gin&s;kaja, to collect plants, I ordered to remain, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to go up the D&s;hida, along the frontier guard-po&s;ts, as far as to the high mountains of Tun|kin&s;kaja, to gather every remarkable plant he could find, make other ob&s;ervations, and wait in Selengin|&s;kaja the arrival of Mr. Sokolof from Dauria, and re|turn with him, in autumn, to Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja.</P>
<P>Before I take my leave, however, of this di&s;trict, I will add &s;ome general ob&s;ervations on it.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="134">I mu&s;t own, that upon the whole Siberian line, from the Uralian mountains, which may be con&s;idered as the line of boundary between Europe and A&s;ia, quite to the Baikal, I have not been able to collect &s;o many new and curious animals and plants, as in that track of land bounded by Mongalia, and on the north by the Baikal. It is certain, that on the Jeni&s;ei, e&s;pecially its upper and &s;outhern di&s;tricts, which are by nature &s;i|milar to tho&s;e of Dauria, many natural curio&s;ities are to be found, e&s;pecially in the botanical line, which are not to be met with in the we&s;tern parts of Siberia, or on the loftier parts of the Altai mountains; but the&s;e productions are no where &s;o copious, &s;o perfect, and genuine as in Dauria, and all the mountains &s;ituated beyond the Baikal. I &s;ay mountains, becau&s;e the whole country is mountainous; for even the plains may be con&s;idered as broad vallies, and are &s;ituated on heights, towards the we&s;t of Siberia, as the gene|rality of Siberian mountain-plants, which grow even in the lowe&s;t vallies, inconte&s;tibly prove, without mak|ing any ob&s;ervations with the barometer. Be&s;ides, the very high, woody mountains, which have their greate&s;t breadth from the Baikal to the &s;ource of the Selenga, forming, with the Sajanian mountains about the Jen|dred, a mighty chain, which &s;preads more towards the ea&s;t, and joins in one part with the we&s;tern bay of the Baikal, but turns, with its principal track, towards Mon|galia, and goes on over the &s;ources of the Jeni&s;ei, Se|lenga, and Tola, and then divides into tho&s;e branches,

which &s;eparate partly the brooks of the Amur from tho&s;e of Siberia; partly its principal rivers, Naun and Scharamurin among them&s;elves; and partly the brooks of the Amur from the Choango: be&s;ides the&s;e tower|ing, chief mountains, full of numerous cupolas, cover|ed with &s;now, and cold, woodle&s;s &s;ummits; all the &s;pace between the Baikal and the frontiers is mo&s;tly full of dry, open, torn, and very &s;teep mountains, in|ter&s;ected with &s;andy vallies and plains; on which it is clearly evident that the &s;and originated in the withered, &s;mall particles of the matrix, and was carried away and &s;pread by winds, rain, &s;now-water, and other &s;treams. For mo&s;t mountains in the&s;e parts con&s;i&s;t of decayed granite-rocks, and other very ancient matrices; and, in &s;ome few places, &s;trata are to be &s;een; the &s;tratum of all the mountains fir&s;t appearing north|wards from the Baikal, and in the upper di&s;trict of the Lena.</P>
<P>As the mountains, both in the di&s;trict of Selengin|&s;kaja and Dauria, are very &s;leep and rocky, and are often nothing more than projecting cliffs and towering pieces of rock, they exhibit an awful &s;ight, and fine, magnificent pro&s;pects. Such a country mu&s;t afford abundance of curious bu&s;hes and &s;hrubs, peculiar to &s;uch &s;oils; and a variety of mountain-plants, as well growing on the mountains them&s;elves, as in the vallies beneath; &s;ome of which are &s;hady, cold, and nar|row, and others open, warm, and &s;andy; and in many
<PB N="133" REF="136">
places, depre&s;&s;ions and low grounds, often enriched with &s;alt-&s;pots. Hence al&s;o mu&s;t be a&s;cribed the great difference of the warmer and colder &s;ituations, in di&s;|tricts adjacent to each other, and in the &s;ame latitude. For example, about Selengin&s;kaja and Kjachta, all &s;orts of garden-&s;tuff, even water-melons, will pro&s;per in the free and open ground; and many rare plants are common, which are generally the product only of warm rocks; whereas in the country, and more to the north, &s;ituated on the Uda, not even corn will-ripen; &s;o again upon the Baikal, under the &s;hadow and cold of the &s;outhern, adjacent mountain, plants grow even to the borders, which otherwi&s;e are only common to the frigid mountains. Al&s;o trees bud later, &s;now falls &s;ooner, and the winter is longer, than 100 miles fur|ther up the Selenga<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"We have read, in a de&s;cription of Norway, that it &s;hall, apparently, be winter on the northern &s;ide of the lofty mountain of Filefield, when at the &s;ame time it &s;hall be &s;ummer on the &s;outhern &s;ide, where it receives the benefit of the &s;un."</NOTE>. This influence of the high &s;i|tuation, un&s;heltered again&s;t the cold, in the climate of the mountainous di&s;tricts I have mentioned, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the principal cau&s;e of the ca&s;t of Sibe|ria, e&s;pecially the di&s;trict &s;outh of the Baikal, being colder than the we&s;tern countries, &s;ituated under the &s;ame latitude.

<P>Firs are the mo&s;t common wood in Dauria, on the Selenga, on account of the &s;andy &s;oil. The higher and colder mountains have larches, white firs, red and white pines, birches, and a&s;ps, promi&s;cuou&s;ly; and the underwood con&s;i&s;ts of birch-bu&s;hes, the Bagulnik, <HI>(Rhododendrum Dauricum)</HI> and various &s;pecies of wil|lows. The higher cliffs, &s;now-clad throughout the year, had on their &s;ummits &s;ome few, creeping trees, or none at all; perhaps &s;ome little &s;hrubs of pines, ce|dars, larches, dwarf-birches, and &s;ome &s;pecies of the plane and &s;avin-trees, and &s;ome particular &s;mall willows.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of this general de&s;cription is, that Dauria, and the di&s;trict of Selengin&s;kaja will never be|come &s;o populous, or &s;o general a corn-country as the re&s;t of Siberia, &s;ituated not &s;o much to the north; there being every where, even in the vallies and plains, many tracks, nothing but rock and &s;and, which no other people but the Mongols and Burats can turn to advantage. But as the&s;e nations will &s;oon &s;carce find &s;pace enough to &s;upport them&s;elves, owing to their

increa&s;e, as is evident about Selengin&s;kaja, it would be policy, in order to bring agriculture to its highe&s;t pitch, to remove &s;ome part of this people into other di&s;tricts; for example, to the &s;andy-&s;alt-de&s;arts about the Irti&s;h or the Baruba, the&s;e places being now left to the treacherous Kirgue&s;e, who never will become hu&s;bandmen.</P>
<P><HI>Selengin&s;kaja.</HI>&mdash;I will now &s;ay a few words of the town of Selengin&s;kaja, and its dependencies. It lies chiefly on a &s;hallow, &s;andy arm of the Selenga, fordable in many places. Behind the town are &s;ome high, &s;and moun|tains, from whence the &s;treets now begin to be over|flown with &s;and. The&s;e mountains are at the &s;ame time richly cloathed with timber and underwood, quite down to the river. From the river's-&s;ide the place makes a good appearance, with its three churches, and the hou&s;e of a commi&s;&s;ioner of &s;tate, now uninhabited. The place is fortified with four, timber ramparts, and towers within the angles. Within the walls is a court of Waywodes, and a court of boundaries; a hou&s;e for the commanding-officer, another for the pre&s;ident, and a guard-hou&s;e, all within a &s;quare. At the upper end are gardens, and a corn-mill, worked by hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Though this town is advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated for the Chine&s;e trade, here are but few, &s;ub&s;tantial merchants. Mo&s;t of the inhabitants are of the middling cla&s;s; the cau&s;e of which probably is, their carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and in|clination
<PB N="136" REF="139">
to extravagance. Many of the citizens &s;catter them&s;elves, and live in other places, in order to be duty-free, and lead a more indolent life, in agri|culture and breeding of cattle. Farms, nay villages, founded by people of this de&s;cription, may be &s;een ju&s;t oppo&s;ite the town, on the left bank of the river. Many of the towns-people, and tho&s;e of the country round the town, &s;hew a great mixture of Mongalian blood; the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial of them having long been in the habit of marrying Mongalian and Buratian wo|men; and, to make an advantageous alliance with the&s;e people, &s;ome Mongols will have their daughters chri&s;tened. There have been in&s;tances about this place, of the Burats them&s;elves embracing the chri&s;tian faith, in order to e&s;pou&s;e the daughter of &s;ome wealthy Ru&s;&s;ian. From &s;uch mixed-marriages &s;pring many mulatto children; the&s;e retain &s;omething of the Mon|galian face, and have black, &s;hining hair, but have, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t regular features, and the &s;weete&s;t countenance, called, in Ru&s;s, <HI>Karymki;</HI> of cour&s;e the Buratian manner of living is almo&s;t as much in u&s;e in this di&s;trict, as the Mongol, or Mongalian language.</P>

Bargu&s;in&s;koi O&s;trog is al&s;o reckon|ed in this di&s;trict, which contains 1600 Tungu&s;e, pay|ing tribute. If to this is added the di&s;trict of Nert|&s;chin&s;kaja, properly Dauria, &s;ubject to the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ceptre; which, except 16,000 Burats and Tungu&s;e, 10,000 of whom live in huts round the Argun, &s;carce contains 11,800 men; near 3000 of whom are colo|ni&s;ts, &s;ent here within the&s;e 15 years, the whole po|pulation of the country beyond the Baikal, which is

<P>The di&s;trict of Selengin&s;kaja, like all others &s;ituated about the Baikal, is &s;ometimes &s;ubject to little earth|quakes. In 1768 two were ob&s;erved in Irkuzkaja; one on the 18th of March, at four in the morning; another on the 5th of Augu&s;t, at four in the afternoon. On the 13th of October, 1769, at eight in the morn|ing, they felt a double &s;hock, the la&s;t pretty &s;trong; in 1771, July 28, about nine in the morning, they had a &s;trong earthquake at Irkuzkaja; and at 11 o'clock the &s;ame morning, in Selengin&s;kaja, which was felt al&s;o in many places. The &s;phere of the&s;e earth|quakes are generally not very exten&s;ive. They are never felt in Dauria, and the northern parts of the Lena; &s;o that the cau&s;e of them mu&s;t be hidden in the mountains &s;ituated clo&s;e about the Baikal, and their warm &s;prings; peculiar pebbles, and the bitumen which the lakes throw out, are evident proofs that there is no want of materials to occa&s;ion &s;uch &s;ubterranean heat and motions. Probably the earthquakes ob&s;erved in the Altai mountain originate from that &s;pot where the Noor Sai&s;&s;ane is encompa&s;&s;ed by mountains.</P>
<P>It was noon, on the 3d day of July, before all the hor&s;es required for our departure could be brought together, and my waggons could cro&s;s the Selenga. I did not take the u&s;ual po&s;t-road, but went &s;traight
<PB N="139" REF="142">
towards the lake Gu&s;inoi o&s;ero <HI>(goo&s;e-lake)</HI> to which the deep and &s;andy valley Tojon leads, and which commences at the hut-mountain behind the Selenga. We reached the lake ju&s;t before dark, during a vio|lent tempe&s;t and deal of rain, and took our lodgings at the north end of the lake. A number of rare plants decorated the &s;ands, which I gathered the next morning; and, among the re&s;t, a peculiar &s;pecies of Robinia, hitherto unknown to botani&s;ts <HI>(Rob. ferox)</HI> which &s;hot into high bu&s;hes and thick branches, often &s;even feet high. This &s;pecies of the fal&s;e acacia|thorn de&s;erves cultivation in Europe, on account of its u&s;efulne&s;s; it being very &s;hort, with long thorns, and &s;preading on the ground, would make exceeding good fences, through which neither man nor cattle would be able to penetrate. The &s;oft points and leaves are al&s;o an agreeable food for &s;heep; and its pods, which are without number, would at lea&s;t an|&s;wer the purpo&s;e of vetches. It is remarkable that this fine bu&s;h, which di&s;plays in &s;pring its numberle&s;s &s;ulphur-yellow flowers, &s;hould no where be met with in all the di&s;tricts beyond the Baikal, except in the great valley, which, from the Temnik and Gu&s;i|noi O&s;ero extends it&s;elf with the Selenga as far as the brook Ubukun, and &s;ome vallies, as far as the Oren|goi. The Mongols and Burats give it no other name than what they give to the &s;malle&s;t acacia-thorn <HI>(Robinia pygmea)</HI> viz. <HI>Charagana.</HI> It grows as well on the moi&s;t and &s;alt-depre&s;&s;ions, or low places, as on drier
<PB N="140" REF="143">
and &s;and-&s;pots, though it prefers the former. It is &s;aid to be very common about Peking, where all the level country is &s;omewhat moi&s;t and &s;alt. It was well known to the Ru&s;&s;ians, who went there with caravans, becau&s;e the Chine&s;e planted this hedge again&s;t the walls which &s;urrounded the caravan-hou&s;e, it being as good as &s;o many centinels, to hinder any one from climb|ing them.</P>
<P>This lake is deep, and if the wind blows ever &s;o little, carries large billows. They &s;ay it was much &s;maller formerly; but that, about 15 years ago, in the month of May, the river Temnik, which is at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance, &s;welled by a &s;udden &s;low, blocked up its own bed with &s;and and floating wood, and made it&s;elf a fre&s;h channel, changing a neighbouring valley into a great lake, part of who&s;e waters have added to this lake. The new channel which the Temnik made is called by the Mongols <HI>Zagan,</HI> i. e. white or holy, from an awful reverence, at having de&s;troyed &s;ome of their fine pa&s;tures in the low grounds. Few great Mongalian Lamas (for prie&s;ts &s;eldom make a bad choice) have fixed their re&s;idence in this delightful vale, and built two fine temples, one at the north end, and the other at the &s;outh. A de&s;cription of the&s;e temples, and the holy offices performed therein, and what I &s;aw when they were going to erect a &s;acred monument on the mountain, on the 4th of July, will accompany my other accounts collected re&s;pecting
<PB N="141" REF="144">
the Mongalian idolatry. The whole valley is &s;o flat, that when the Temnik &s;ought a new channel, they feared a general inundation as far as the &s;alt-lake Solunoi O&s;ero.</P>
<P>Round about this lake, which is not above a mile and a half from the one where we took up our night's lodging, the ground is white, with a bitter &s;alt, and full of &s;alt-plants; its length is about half a mile, its form oblong, and its greate&s;t diameter lies from ea&s;t to we&s;t. Many fre&s;h-water rivulets flow from the north &s;ide into it, which le&s;&s;ens its &s;altne&s;s, and ren|ders the &s;alt unfit for boiling in &s;ummer-time. The &s;alt-veins &s;eem to be within the lake it&s;elf; for, when the water freezes in autumn, we &s;ee &s;pots where no ice will &s;ettle, and there the &s;alt-water is &s;tronger. They tried an experiment on &s;uch a &s;pot in 1762, and put down a pipe into &s;uch a &s;alt-water &s;pring; and, at the depth of more than &s;even ells, found no|thing but &s;lime; but, having felt &s;omething hard under this &s;lime, they applied a bore, and brought up a piece of pure ice; and, ob&s;erving afterwards that fre&s;h water i&s;&s;ued from the place, they left it to it&s;elf, to &s;eek for the real &s;alt veins on the borders of the lake. They have made many un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts, and wherever they bored, fre&s;h water has i&s;&s;ued out.</P>
<P>The bottom of the lake con&s;i&s;ts of a blue &s;lime, on which, when the fro&s;t comes, a &s;cum, &s;everal inches
<PB N="142" REF="145">
thick, will &s;ettle, con&s;i&s;ting of pure Glauber-&s;alts, which, when dried in the air, crumbles into a white, farinaceous &s;ub&s;tance. Continual, dry weather, and &s;ummer-heats, will divide this &s;cum from the &s;alt-wa|ter, and it will then &s;wim in tender &s;cum on the &s;ur|face of the lake, which, at a di&s;tance, in the &s;un|&s;hine, has a red appearance, and, by the motion of the water, will &s;ink to the bottom. The water is otherwi&s;e clear; has no red appearance, but in &s;um|mer-time will &s;mell like foul mire. It is not &s;uffici|ently impregnated with &s;alt, &s;o as to be fit for boiling till autumn, when it has an ice-cru&s;t upon the &s;urface. They begin to boil in November, and continue till the middle of March, when the &s;now-water from the mountains dimini&s;hes its &s;trength. In the&s;e four months they procure but 20,000 puds of &s;alt. There are at pre&s;ent two &s;alt-hou&s;es, with proper pans, where they boil &s;alt; and they are preparing to erect a third. Within 24 hours a pan is completed, and yields 600 pails full, equal to 1200 common pails, or about 100 puds of &s;alt. The boiled &s;alt is fine, white, granu|lous, and very pure, but is not to be compared in &s;altne&s;s with that of Angar&s;koi. Even what they &s;crape from the pans is pure &s;alt; this they throw away as rubbi&s;h, but why, I know not. The Imperial trea&s;ury pays, on the &s;pot, 10 copecs to the boiler for every pud of &s;alt, deducting a duty of 11 per cent. When proper agree|ments are made, the &s;alt is tran&s;ported to the &s;tore-hou&s;es, or wherever it is wanted. The wood they
<PB N="143" REF="146">
u&s;e, in boiling, is felled at the di&s;tance of three or four miles from the lake, and 16 miles from the Selenga, paying 15 copecs per &s;tack for felling, and 20 copecs for carriage. This would not make the boiling dear, but the iron for the pans is brought from the &s;mithery at Kutun&s;kaja, at 70 copecs per pud, and a pan will not la&s;t a whole winter, without mending.</P>
<P>In 1728 there was a boiling-hou&s;e, with one pan, at the expence of the crown, which was &s;oon after &s;old to a private per&s;on. From this fir&s;t proprietor the &s;alt-works became the property of the family of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, Michael Pachol&s;of, who has, be&s;ides the boiling-hou&s;es, two neat hou&s;es for his own re&s;i|dence; a &s;tore-hou&s;e, in which at pre&s;ent are 15,000 puds of &s;alt, ready to convey away; and al&s;o &s;ome hou&s;es for his workmen.</P>
<P>When I had viewed the&s;e works, I made the be&s;t of my way to the po&s;t-road, behind which flows the brook Ubukun, on which there is a po&s;t-&s;tation, about 30 miles from Selengin&s;kaja, and &s;even from the &s;alt-lake. I did not &s;leep here, but three miles and a half lower down the Ubukun, in a village of &s;ix hou&s;es erected on it. The road to it is over a moderate mountain, where a &s;tone-&s;earcher had dug &s;ome try|ing-pits on account of a demi-tran&s;parent, greeni&s;h and amethy&s;t-coloured, flaming &s;par, which breaks above ground. In the &s;par lay kidnies of yellowi&s;h and
<PB N="144" REF="147">
greyi&s;h agate. This &s;pot, and the whole mountain, de&s;erves a &s;tricter examination.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of nine miles from this, the river Orongoi is pa&s;&s;ed by a flying bridge. At Udin&s;koi, 30 miles further, where I &s;lept on the 7th of July, I received a number of letters, &s;ent to me to the Onon, but which there mi&s;&s;ed me; and from this place I &s;ent back my Mongalian interpreters, having no further oc|ca&s;ion for them.</P>
<P>Beyond Udin&s;koi are &s;everal little villages, and the &s;tep, about the lowermo&s;t part of the Selenga, is very fertile and populous; indeed, one of the mo&s;t populous di&s;tricts beyond the Baikal, containing from 8 to 900 pea&s;ant families, and two convents. On the 8th of July I reached the Baikal &s;ea, where I met with a number of plants peculiar only to cold mountains; for in&s;tance, <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbra Empetrum rignum, Campanula rotun|difolia, Fumaria impatiens, Polygonum divaricatum, angu&s;ti&s;olium, et &s;ericeum, Scrophularia &s;corodonia, Dracocephelum nulans, Lycep&s;is v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;icaria,</HI> and many others. The <HI>Pyrola rotundifolia,</HI> which grows &s;o very large in Siberia, is often here gathered, in ca&s;e of need, by the pea&s;ants, and u&s;ed as tea. The&s;e moun|tain-plants, which are &s;o generally to be met with on the low &s;hores of the Baikal, ari&s;e from the cold and foggy air in &s;ummer, from the adjacent, high moun|tains, and the effect of the &s;now-clad cliffs, which the
<PB N="145" REF="148">
lofty mountains &s;tanding round the Kuluk, or we&s;tern bay of the Baikal, rai&s;e above the clouds.</P>
<P><HI>Baikal.</HI>&mdash;When I arrived at the convent of Po&s;ol&s;|koi, the Baikal was covered with &s;uch a thick and cold fog, as is only to be &s;een in high mountains, which attract the clouds, or in &s;ea-coa&s;t countries, during autumn and winter. It re&s;embled clouds enclo&s;ed within mountains, had already continued eight days, and la&s;ted till the 20th of July, during calm weather, amid the breeze of we&s;tern winds. In the mean time, there fell &s;uch a rain in all the high mountains of Dauria, al&s;o north of the Baikal, and about the Jeni|&s;ei, which never had been remembered in the&s;e di&s;|tricts, and which continued, with very little &s;erene intermi&s;&s;ion, till late in autumn, and de&s;troyed the hay and harve&s;t. The &s;pring, and the fir&s;t half of &s;ummer, had been, in the&s;e parts, uncommonly dry, and without rain.</P>
<P>The we&s;tern winds, which u&s;ually continue &s;ome time in the Baikal, gave me but little hopes of cro&s;&s;ing over to the mouth of the Angara; and tho' the Im|perial galliot, which &s;erved here as a packet-boat, ar|rived here from the other &s;ide, almo&s;t in the &s;ame hour that I did, yet the pa&s;&s;age &s;eemed almo&s;t impracticable for a long while. This galliot, called the Boris-O-Gleb, is navigated by a pilot from Ochozkaja, and is, at pre&s;ent, the only ve&s;&s;el that &s;ails in the Baikal, the
<PB N="146" REF="149">
merchants u&s;ing their dangerous do&s;t&s;chenicks, which go with &s;ails, before tack winds only, or el&s;e with rudders. A galliot was here &s;tranded, in autumn 1770, not far from the mouth of the Selenga, and was lo&s;t. Indeed, galliots are not fit for this &s;ea, which is &s;o nar|row; ve&s;&s;els with rudders, or demi-gallies, would be of more utility.</P>
<P>I occupied my&s;elf therefore with collecting of plants, and viewing the fi&s;heries u&s;ual in &s;ummer, in the &s;traights of Po&s;ol&s;kaja, till the weather was finer. There is a duty on this fi&s;hery, as on other con&s;ider|able ones, and the convent here receives a certain number of tons, as a privilege. The fi&s;hery is carried on, through the whole &s;ummer, with drag-nets, 200 fathoms long, which, as the &s;ea is not very deep on this coa&s;t, they let out from a barge, with a tackling 300 fathoms in length, which is afterwards taken in, by means of a reel fixed on the &s;hore. In &s;pring, as &s;oon as the ice breaks, they catch abundantly the Sigi mor&s;kye <HI>(Salmo oxyrhinchus)</HI> and Lenki, which come upon the &s;ands to &s;pawn. In &s;ummer, this fi&s;h &s;eeks the deep, and is not caught here, but on the northern &s;teep and rocky coa&s;t, which is very deep. At pre|&s;ent they caught nothing but what is called the <HI>Omul,</HI> which &s;trays, at this time, in great quantities, on the &s;outhern banks, and towards autumn &s;eeks the mouth of the rivers on this &s;ide. This fi&s;h, about the mouth of the Selenga, is not more than eight or nine inches
<PB N="147" REF="150">
thick; it is the&s;e only that are caught annually in the bay of T&s;chiwirkui, are remarkable for their &s;ize, and are caught no where el&s;e on the coa&s;t of the Baikal. This is a new proof, that fi&s;hes, like birds of pa&s;&s;age, return annually to the place of their birth, and do not readily &s;pawn, or enter any other river, than where they fir&s;t received life. The pa&s;&s;age of the omuls is known in all di&s;tricts &s;ituated on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Baikal; or the inhabitants of tho&s;e places, who&s;e &s;limy rivers do not abound in fi&s;h, would otherwi&s;e want food for fa&s;t-days. They generally come at the A&s;cen&s;ion of the Virgin, and as they advance but &s;low, arrive, about the latter end of September, near Udin&s;koi Prigorud.</P>
<P>They never enter the Uda, or Chilok, though plen|tifully caught at the mouth of the&s;e rivers, but abun|dantly vi&s;it the D&s;hida, the T&s;chikoi, pa&s;t Irluzkaja, and the Selenga, up to the Orgon; and when the ice breaks, return quite &s;pent, and exhau&s;ted, to the Bai|kal, and many lo&s;e their life without reaching it. The milder the autumn, the later they enter the rivers; and if the ice breaks &s;oon, return early, and do not go up into the upper di&s;tricts. The omul comes origi|nally from the glacial &s;ea, and not only enters the Jeni&s;ei, but all the rivers of Kam&s;chatka. Through the Jeni&s;ei it comes into the Baikal, not only by means of the Tungu&s;ka and Angara, but al&s;o by the Tuba, and the large lake, Mad&s;har, on the Sajanian mountains.
<PB N="148" REF="151">
Having found a wide and deep water in this &s;ea, at its return from the upper river, it would not go back in|to the ocean, but breeds in this enormous &s;pace of water, &s;heltered from all fi&s;h of prey.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ence of the &s;ea-dog in the Baikal is much more wonderful, as the&s;e animals never leave the ocean &s;o far as to enter the rivers; and, at this time, is not ob&s;erved in the Jeni&s;ei, nor the lower Angara; there|fore mu&s;t have come here by &s;ome great change in the &s;urface of the earth, or by &s;ome extraordinary and rare accident. More rare &s;till is a &s;pecies of fi&s;h, quite natural to the Baikal, called by the Ru&s;&s;ians <HI>Go|lomjanka,</HI> which is &s;aid to have been di&s;covered but a few years &s;ince, though here before, and, perhaps, un|di&s;covered by negligence. This fi&s;h <HI>(Callyonymus Bai|kalen&s;is)</HI> has no more &s;olidity than a piece of fat, and are ab&s;olutely full of an oily &s;ub&s;tance, which, if the whole fi&s;h is put on a gridiron, will melt away to the bones. They are never caught in nets, nor alive. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, and with &s;ome probability, that they re&s;ide only in the deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the Baikal, which in the middle, and not far from the northern, &s;teep, mountain-coa&s;t, cannot be fathomed with lines of three to four hundred fathoms. What cau&s;e or change in the &s;ea brings them &s;o high is hard to tell. They arc com|monly thrown out by violent, northern &s;torms, on the coa&s;t of Po&s;ol&s;koi, and about the mouth of the Selenga, in &s;ummer-time only, when a calm &s;ucceeds a &s;torm.
<PB N="149" REF="152">
They are &s;een in many hundreds &s;wimming and plough|ing the &s;urface of the &s;ea. For many years they were thrown out &s;o abundantly, as to lie in heaps on the &s;trand, like a rampart, and the inhabitants turned them to profit, by boiling train-oil from them, which the Chine&s;e bought up at a great price. In June, this year, but few of them were driven a&s;hore. I re|ceived &s;ome of them twice, by means of me&s;&s;engers di&s;patched occa&s;ionally to Po&s;ol&s;koi; &s;ome dried, and &s;ome pre&s;erved in brandy. They appeared for the la&s;t time on the 24th of June, and were neither touched by in&s;ects, nor crows, probably on account of the rank|ne&s;s of their fat, which melts in a few hours, and &s;ome|times in the hand.</P>
<P>On the 10th, the ma&s;ter of the galliot gave notice, that whoever wi&s;hed to make his pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t go on board. Every thing to be &s;hipped was put that night on board; but during the whole night the wind blew &s;o hard, we&s;t, that the thoughts of cro&s;&s;ing was almo&s;t de&s;paired of. Tho&s;e who navigate the Baikal have a particular compa&s;s, which marks only three winds; tho&s;e that blow between the north, ea&s;t, and &s;outh, called <HI>Barguim,</HI> with which the pa&s;&s;age from the mouth of the Selenga over the lake is ea&s;y and rea|dy, as they blow all from the &s;ame place. All the winds between the north-we&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t, which apparently come out from the large Baikal-Bay, are called <HI>Kultuk;</HI> and tho&s;e that blow &s;traight north, from

the mountainous, northern coa&s;t, have the general name of <HI>Gornoja Pagoda</HI> (mountain-winds), la&s;t but a &s;hort time, but are the more dangerous, and common|ly, &s;udden-raging hurricanes, which &s;trand the ve&s;&s;els, or drive them to pieces on the &s;outhern, &s;hallow coa&s;t; and &s;ometimes, if the &s;ails are not expeditiou&s;ly taken in, will over&s;et the ve&s;&s;el, or di&s;ma&s;t it. Other winds are not &s;o dangerous, as the Baikal has no &s;and-bank, or &s;hoals, between the mouths of the Selenga and An|gara, except a &s;ingle one (di&s;covered by trading-boats), around which the &s;ea is deep. The depth of the Baikal in the middle, and in the northern borders, is unfathomable. This lake, or &s;ea, is like a huge cleft opened by the torn mountains, in which the ad|jacent rivers took their mouths. The mountainous coa&s;t it&s;elf &s;hews everywhere marks of the mo&s;t violent changes, and, at the &s;ame time, of the highe&s;t anti|quity.</P>
<P>About 11 o'clock at night ro&s;e a good, &s;outh-we&s;t wind, by which a &s;kilful &s;eaman could have ea&s;ily reached the mouth of the Angara, or pretty near it. Our ma&s;ter thinking he could do the &s;ame, the anchor was weighed by his order, whil&s;t he lay in bed, and a &s;ailor, who &s;teered the ve&s;&s;el, carried us over, but fur|ther from the mouth of the Selenga than we were when at Po&s;ol&s;koi. When the ma&s;ter awaked, and &s;aluted the morning, we found our&s;elves in the Pe&s;t&s;chanaja-Guba (&s;and-bay), above 75 miles above Li&s;tweni&s;choe
<PB N="151" REF="154">
Simowje, to which it is but 71 miles from Po&s;ol&s;koi, mea&s;ured upon the ice, and paid for in the packet|boat. The wind grew more violent, and would not &s;uffer us to quit the coa&s;t; &s;o that our ma&s;ter, without further attempts, ordered his men to ca&s;t anchor, and wait for a better wind.</P>
<P>This beginning of our un&s;ucce&s;sful navigation was not &s;o di&s;agreeable to me, as I had enough to employ me in collecting plants on the rocky coa&s;t, which were now in full perfection, and &s;ome of them very rare. They al&s;o fi&s;hed the whole day on the &s;ands of the bay. On the bare&s;t parts of the barren rocks grew, plenti|fully, the delicate &s;tone-leek <HI>(allium Altaicum)</HI> which was greedily eaten by the &s;ailors. Of all the plants, the <HI>polypodium fragrans</HI> de&s;erves to be mentioned. This rare, fine, and mo&s;t fragrant fern, is collected from the highe&s;t rocks, where it grows out from the clefts, and is called by the Burats <HI>&s;erlik,</HI> and is drank by them as a remedy in mo&s;t &s;corbutic and paralytic com|plaints. It may as well be drank for its fine ta&s;te, as if two or three leaf-&s;talks are added to it, it flavours the common, green tea to the highe&s;t degree of perfection. Its &s;mell is &s;o powerful, that it will communicate its fragrance to whole bundles of herbs, and boxes full of paper.</P>
<P>As a &s;mall, ea&s;t wind ro&s;e towards night, we weigh|ed anchor, and &s;pread &s;ail; but this was &s;carce done,
<PB N="152" REF="155">
before a we&s;t-wind blew again, and we were obliged to &s;eek a new anchoring-place, at the lower end of the bay.</P>
<P>On the 13th our captain got out his drag-tackling, and thus hauled the ve&s;&s;el on about 10 miles, where we anchored again. It was a fine &s;ight about the rocks of the Baklanye, to &s;ee the innumerable crowds of ra|vens that were building their ne&s;ts, and the whole rock covered with their white dung. Some of the crew went towards the rock in a boat, when the old ravens &s;luttered above the rock, and the young ones, that could not fly, threw them&s;elves from the rock in|to the &s;ea. On the 14th we advanced a little on, and a gentle gale &s;pringing up about noon, we got about 14 miles further, where hor&s;es were employed to drag the ve&s;&s;el all the next day, when we anchored afre&s;h. This mi&s;erable vovage now became irk&s;ome to me, and I would certainly have gone to Irkuzkaja by land, if there had been any pa&s;&s;able road: but there being no &s;uch thing, I got from the ma&s;ter of the pacquet his &s;mall, flat-bottomed boat, which he had in the gal|liot, and ordering a little po&s;t-waggon I had with me to be placed acro&s;s it, &s;o that its wheels almo&s;t touched the water, I manned it partly with my own people, and partly with pa&s;&s;engers, whom I encouraged with a promi&s;ed reward, left the ve&s;&s;el, with our baggage on board, and rowed for the mouth of the Angara. This expedition almo&s;t proved my la&s;t. The wind

The &s;ailor who &s;teered our boat, and who had cro&s;&s;ed a bay and reached the next cape, wi&s;hed to &s;horten the labour of the rowers; in&s;tead, there|fore, of keeping round by the &s;hore, he attempted to cro&s;s a bay more than &s;even miles over; but we had no &s;ooner left the cape, than the wind blew &s;o violent, and we were carried &s;o far off the coa&s;t, that it was with the utmo&s;t danger and difficulty we could reach the next cape; for my part, I expected every in&s;tant to have been a prey to the waves. In order not to be expo&s;ed to a &s;imilar danger, we took a tackle, fa&s;tened it to the boat, and had it dragged along the coa&s;t. We had &s;till great trouble to get pa&s;t the projecting rocks of &s;ome high mountains, which, from top to bottom, had been apparently &s;oft, and &s;eemed kneaded together, cemented by large and &s;mall peb|bles, carried all round, in the water, by a &s;andy and limy &s;pecies of &s;tone, and convinces me, that there mu&s;t have been &s;ome mighty change in the mountains of the Baikal.

<P>After a good deal of anxiety and labour we reached the mouth of the Angara in good time, and in good condition. On the 16th I &s;et out in the evening for

Irkuzkaja, a di&s;tance of more than 40 miles, in the road to which there are way-hou&s;es every four or five miles, and arrived there early on the 17th. I &s;topped at this place as long only as it was nece&s;&s;ary, and, on the 22d, pur&s;ued my journey to Kra&s;nor|jar&s;kaja, a di&s;tance of 614 miles, the road to which I de&s;cribed when I pa&s;&s;ed it before.</P>
<P>On the Oka, ju&s;t below the highe&s;t mountain, lies Okin&s;koi Karaul, the outermo&s;t guard-&s;tation of the di&s;trict of Udin&s;koi, &s;ubject to the regency of Irkuzkaja. It is 121 miles from the la&s;t frontier-guard of the di&s;trict of Kjachta, and from the frontier-mark on the mountain Gurban, 103 miles, but from another, &s;ituate on the Choin-raban, 105 miles. Mea&s;ured from the we&s;tern frontier-guard of Win&s;koi, it is 115 miles. In almo&s;t all villages, from Irkuzkaja, 200 miles forward, I found children inoculated with the &s;mall|pox, in this month, July, by the &s;urgeon of Irkuzkaja. This &s;alutary operation has the mo&s;t pro&s;perous event in this regency. Trials have already been made among the Burats, who re&s;ide about Irkuzkaja, who&s;e diet and way of living is &s;o unwhole&s;ome, and by this means the &s;mall-pox will &s;oon become le&s;s dangerous among the heathens, whom it frequently carries off.</P>
<P><HI>Udin&s;koi.</HI>&mdash;About half way from Irkuzkaja, to Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, is Udin&s;koi O&s;trog, where I arrived on the 27th of July. It lies on the river Uda, and
<PB N="155" REF="158">
though it is a place of little importance, has a gover|nor and two frontier-guards, under the command of the governor of Tom&s;koi. Here is al&s;o an in&s;pector of the di&s;trict of Udin&s;koi. In this di&s;trict, which con|&s;i&s;ts of 553 men that pay tribute, they reckon 16 little tribes of heathens, &s;ome of Tartarian, &s;ome of Buratian origin. The&s;e little tribes, &s;cattered about on the wild mountains, are the offsprings of fugitives, the relicks of &s;everal hordes, driven from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Siberia, and who have flown here for refuge. Some &s;eem to be of different origin, &s;peaking a mixt lan|guage, between Mongol and Tartarian. The mo&s;t remarkable is the tribe of Kara&s;koi, which, like the Koibales and Matores, on the Jeni&s;ei, have pre&s;erved the Samjoede language, with little mixture, though there are only 22 men. There are &s;ome, &s;mall tribes on the mountains, who &s;peak their own language, but I could gather no accurate account of them. The Kara&s;ka&s;&s;ians live, like the re&s;t of the mountain-Tar|tars, by hunting, and have no other dome&s;tic cattle than a few rein-deer, with which they remove their hou&s;hold-&s;tuff from one place to another. Their &s;u|per&s;tition, which, though baptized, they keep up, is the mo&s;t &s;imple to be met with. They have neither idols nor magicians, but wor&s;hip the heavens, and the &s;un. They are ignorant of &s;acrifices, except that when they have killed a bear, or &s;ome other game, they rai&s;e his head and heart, on a piece of bark, to|wards heaven, and beg for a good chace in future.
<PB N="156" REF="159">
They al&s;o &s;hew a kind of reverence, like other Si|berian pagans, to certain rivers and mountains, feed|ing the former, and carrying on the latter a little rice, or tobacco, and leaving it on the place. They bury their dead on a &s;caffold of forks and bu&s;hes, or upon trees, with the head toward the ea&s;t, or only cover them with bu&s;hes. Tho&s;e whom they affec|tionately love, they burn. Their wretched jurts are covered with hides, and they dre&s;s them&s;elves in &s;kins, &s;eldom continuing more than two or three days on the &s;ame &s;pot, wandering about in &s;earch of the Sarana, or hilly onion, which makes a chief part of their food. Two bags of &s;arana, or &s;ome good cedar|nuts, which contain about three and a half puds, they con&s;ider equal in value to a rein-deer; and after this manner they formerly calculated their tribute, which made about 20 rein deer for the whole tribe. But at pre&s;ent they do military duty, in the frontiers of Udin&s;koi, and pay al&s;o their ja&s;&s;ak, or tribute, which amounts to about two rubles a man. Their women wear, in &s;ummer, broad, round hats, made of twi&s;ted reed, but no caps, and in&s;tead of &s;tockings, they wrap their legs round with the outer bark of <HI>Lonicera pyre|naica.</HI> I &s;hall give a &s;pecimen of their language further on, when I &s;peak of their dialects.</P>
<P>Eight miles from Udin&s;koi, we were obliged to go down from the heights to the brook Kamenka, through the narrow dale, in which a waggon has &s;carce room
<PB N="157" REF="160">
to pa&s;s, and on the brook we &s;ee fine, lofty banks, where &s;and-rocks are &s;o tender, that they may be reduced to powder, by &s;queezing them in the hand.</P>
<P>On the 29th of July, I &s;topped at Rybin&s;koi, chiefly to view the Siberian melting of iron by hand-bla&s;ts, performed by a &s;mith from the Jeni&s;ei. The ore he u&s;es is one of the mo&s;t remarkable things in the whole empire, and was di&s;covered by a fox that dug up the ground, and was caught at that time by a pea&s;ant. It con&s;i&s;ts of large and &s;mall pieces of petrified wood, changed into a rich, &s;olid, brown, iron-&s;tone, and &s;hews even marks of the bark. The &s;mith of this place has di&s;covered this wonderful ore in two &s;pots adja|cent to his &s;mithery. The one at three miles di&s;tance, on a flat mountain, covered with birch-trees, lying in whole trunks, extending north and &s;outh, in a &s;andy-matrix, much mixed with iron-ochre; the other at the di&s;tance only of three quarters of a mile, and lying in the &s;ame nature. The metalized trunks, though of the &s;ame appearance, will not yield any iron for melt|ing, but the &s;mith got a &s;pecies of raw iron out of it, which, being coppery, is of little value.</P>
<P>I reached Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja the fir&s;t week in Augu&s;t, and though the bloom, in this di&s;trict, was on the decline, and mo&s;t plants in &s;eeds, yet, through the indu&s;try of Mr. Ka&s;chkaref, who was here &s;ome time before, and had made many little excur&s;ions to the river Mana,
<PB N="158" REF="161">
and the Sajanian mountains, I received a complete collection of the plants which the mountains of the Jeni&s;ei yield in &s;ummer; but the&s;e were chiefly rare plants, an&s;wering, in &s;ome degree, Mr. Gmelin's account, who &s;ays, that ea&s;tward of the Jeni&s;ei nature changes at once, and has an A&s;iatic bloom of its own. My curio&s;ity, however, was much deceived by this flatter|ing account. Indeed, the di&s;trict of Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, as a dry, open, and mountainous country, has, for this very rea&s;on, &s;everal rare mountain-plants of its own, and &s;ome &s;till more rare to be met with in the more &s;outhern mountains, between the Yjus and Jeni&s;ei, &amp;c. but no &s;ooner is the Jeni&s;ei cro&s;&s;ed and left, than the whole country, between the Tungu&s;ka and the boundary-mountains, is covered with woods and meadow-grounds, where the bloom is little different from that about the Ob, Irti&s;ch, and even the Uralian chain, re&s;embling tho&s;e of the European Alps.</P>
<P>I was detained in arranging my ob&s;ervations on the natural curio&s;ities of a five months collection, and in the unexpected arrival of Mr. Surjef, till the 19th of Augu&s;t. He had not pur&s;ued his journey from Man|ga&s;ei to the Frozen Ocean, but had returned from Selakino, &s;ituated 475 miles beyond Manga&s;ei, and about 240 miles from the main-&s;ea. His journal con|tained nothing curious, except a heavy de&s;cription of the navigation. I &s;hall therefore abridge it, in order not to tire my readers: pre&s;enting only &s;uch things as are mo&s;t remarkable.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="162">In the vicinage of Manga&s;ei re&s;ide chiefly the baptized Jakutians, who&s;e number amounts only to 127 men. The Tungu&s;e in the Jeni&s;ei make out, in general, a nation of 2000 men; 1282 of whom are within the juri&s;diction of Manga&s;ei, and the re&s;t of Jeni&s;ei&s;kaja. In the di&s;trict of Manga&s;ei are 640 Samojedes, 351 comprehended under the name of Ea&s;tjaiks, and 479 men immediately from Jeni&s;ei&s;koi.</P>
<P>Beyond Manga&s;ei the river Jeni&s;ei is of a va&s;t breadth, particularly towards Selakino, where it be|gins to form bays. In &s;ome places, where there are no i&s;lands, its breadth is more than eight miles, &s;o that the oppo&s;ite &s;hore is &s;carcely vi&s;ible. The right border of the river is every where mountainous, yet the mountains are not high; the left is free from mountains, yet very elevated, and, like the mountain-&s;ide, covered with woods. The &s;now and ice on the border does not melt till the end of June; and in the narrow vallies, excavated by the &s;now-water, and on the land of the free, open heights, it thaws only to a &s;mall depth: for we found often underneath the mo&s;s and roots of the little willows, which grew on that mo&s;s, bare ice, or hard, frozen ground. Alders, larches, willows and birches, generally bloom there about the end of June; other plants &s;hew their blo&s;&s;oms much earlier; and this is in the 66th degree of latitude. Beyond Plachina were found &s;ome petrified mu&s;cles, and above Selakino, a tooth, and &s;ome other remains of elephants.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="163">The river Jeni&s;ei, in its lower di&s;tricts, is much more peopled with Ru&s;&s;ians than the Ob, as being more fertile. Chantai&s;koi Pogort, 225 miles beyond Manga&s;ei, has, be&s;ides a church, only four dwellings, three of which are the habitations of &s;ome Ru&s;&s;ian prie&s;ts; but there are a great many &s;cattered, &s;ingle hou&s;es, all along the banks of the river, as far as the fro|zen ocean.</P>
<P>On the 19th of Augu&s;t I left Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, and the &s;ame afternoon directed my journey to the Sa|janian mountains; and as I was to travel a road that had not been trod for 20 years, and was mar&s;hy, and entirely overgrown with wood, I &s;ent people before, to clear the way, and prepare me pa&s;&s;ages over ri|vers and brooks. Some days I could get on pretty well, and &s;ome others, I could not travel more than about 20 miles.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t we had a very difficult road indeed to pa&s;s, through a bewildered fore&s;t, many mar&s;hy defiles and bogs, rendered wor&s;e by a two-months rain. We could not cro&s;s the mires, but by placing faggots every &s;tep before us, to prevent our &s;inking; yet, with all this difficulty, we made &s;hift to advance 30 miles. We &s;lept in a fore&s;t; it thundered and rained all the night, but the darkne&s;s of the night added &s;omething to the plea&s;ure we received in the &s;ight of a number of glow-worms, which were collected
<PB N="161" REF="164">
in heaps, in rotten leaves and &s;prays, which &s;hone every where with great brilliancy. They are &s;carce &s;ix lines long, &s;omewhat thicker than a hor&s;e-hair, and look like chee&s;e-maggots. The&s;e woods are al&s;o re|markable for a &s;pecies of nightingale, with cinnabar|red throats <HI>(Motacilla Calliope.)</HI></P>
<P>On the 26th I cro&s;&s;ed the Yjus, and continued my way up the river, to Kokowo Ulu&s;s, where I &s;pent the night. From this place we &s;ee, higher up on the we&s;t, &s;ide of the Yjus, a mountain of a peculiar form, called by the Tartars <HI>Anlo;</HI> it is &s;ituated about eight or 10 miles from this place, about three miles from the left banks of the river, and near 27 miles from Kary&s;chkoi Rudnick. The mountain ri&s;es gently on one &s;ide to the top, and there forms a wide cleft, with a &s;quare, rocky precipice, and from the center of the cleft pro|jects a &s;mall rock.</P>
<P>This &s;quare rock is what is properly called Aulo, and is wor&s;hipped by the Tartars. Orix Dmittrei, Wa&s;&s;ilief, from Tom&s;koi, who was exiled in his youth from Ru&s;&s;ia to the huts of Barnaul, has begun a regular mine-work, on a we&s;tern, adjacent mountain, either from whim, or &s;ome impo&s;ing view; under a pretence of &s;ome trea|&s;ures being here buried by an ancient Mongol khan, called Altyn. According to his own account, one Samet Ar&s;chanof, a Tartar of Kat&s;chin&s;kaja, who had been often &s;ent with Imperial di&s;patches from
<PB N="162" REF="165">
Ru&s;&s;ia to the Mongols, under the protection of the Chine&s;e, had often heard it &s;aid, and that indeed it was an old &s;aying among them, that Altyn-chan had formerly reigned in the di&s;trict about the Yjus, and having been obliged to retire, had concealed all his riches and jewels in &s;ome hidden cavern in the envi|rons of the rock Anlo. This &s;aying is the only rea&s;on of their digging. His impo&s;tures go &s;till farther, pre|tending, that on the river T&s;chulym live &s;ome Mongol women, who po&s;&s;e&s;s Mongol manu&s;cripts, de&s;cribing all the acce&s;&s;es to the cavern in which the trea&s;ures are concealed.</P>
<P>Hence it mu&s;t be concluded, and from the character of the man, that he is an able impo&s;tor, who, by the above pretexts, has per&s;uaded &s;ome credulous peo|ple, and &s;ome of his own children, who are &s;ub&s;tan|tial per&s;ons, to advance him money on this project, which allows him to lead an indolent life. He has ordered &s;hafts to be dug in two places, where this mountain has clefts, to the depth of many fathoms, and has employed people &s;everal winters in this work, and &s;till goes on with hired workmen, digging into this hard rock, and blowing it up with gunpowder. A large, white-headed vulture, who once lighted on the top of this mountain, after hovering a long time above it, and looking down on the &s;pot, he took for a me&s;&s;enger &s;ent to point out the trea&s;ures. On &s;ome places are the remains of bones, and the teeth of ani|mals,
<PB N="163" REF="166">
and &s;ome dead &s;erpents were found in the clefts. The&s;e are, he &s;ays, the remains of &s;acrifices offered to the evil &s;pirits, when the trea&s;ure was depo&s;ited, and thus given to them. The&s;e goblins, he pretends, play him a number of tricks, throwing &s;tones at the work|men, and extingui&s;hing the light brought to fire the powder, and often deceive him and his men, by call|ing and other means, and by this method colours his enterprize with the appearance of importance, and captivates the belief of the Siberian pea&s;ants. As he writes expeditiou&s;ly, he keeps a journal of &s;uch-like hard&s;hips, of which whole quires were laid before me.</P>
<P>I thought it not worth my attention to in&s;pect any part of the works of this wrong-headed fool, but &s;ent Mr. Surjef there on this object, employing my time in botanical re&s;earches, and viewing the bitter, &s;alt-lakes in the neighbourhood, where large quantities of &s;alt are prepared, and the place guarded by Co&s;&s;acks.</P>
<P>On the 28th of Augu&s;t, I reached the mines of Kary&s;chkoi Rudnick, and &s;taid &s;ome days to examine them. The&s;e were fir&s;t worked by a private per&s;on. This man did not dig very deep, being contented with the day-ores, the chief of which were very irony, and not knowing how to &s;melt them, he was di&s;couraged, and a barge-load of the be&s;t ore being &s;unk in carrying it along the river Jeni&s;ei, he gave the mine up. In 1759, Coun&s;ellor Kleopin came here, and &s;et &s;ome
<PB N="164" REF="167">
men to work, but he was tired in the cour&s;e of one &s;ummer. Some noble metals, however, breaking into lazuli-pebbles, called the attention of the crown, who &s;ent Captain Mettich, of Brun&s;wick, and he began working it in 1764, and continued it till la&s;t year. In the &s;everal trying-pits made by this gentleman, the riche&s;t ore broke ne&s;twi&s;e, and was u&s;ually better in the day than in the depth. It con&s;i&s;ted of fine, vio|let, or lazuli-like, and al&s;o pale-green and yellow pebbles, partly &s;prinkled in with, and partly breaking into, compact and rich nodules, with veins of verdi|gris, in a wild and ferruginous matrix. At the depth of from eight to nine fathoms, this matrix prevailed &s;o much, that the works, though continued to 10 fa|thoms, were &s;o dull, that they are now &s;u&s;pended. Many thou&s;and puds of ore, however, have been here dug, e&s;pecially of the above-mentioned, rich pebbles, which, on an a&s;&s;ay, yielded, in one way, in a hundred pud weight of ore, 22&frac12; puds of copper, and three pounds, 62 drams of &s;ilver; and in another, 20 pounds raw-&s;tone, 15 pounds of refined copper, and nine drams of &s;ilver per pud, with many gold marks. In the depth, the meane&s;t iron-ore yielded 15 puds of raw-iron, 20 pounds of copper, and 25 drams of &s;ilver <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>Another mine adjoining has been opened this year, and is now working. Here is a quartz lode, more than &s;even feet broad, which runs towards midnight.
<PB N="165" REF="168">
In it lies a brown ochre, in clefts and in nodules, and yellow mulm, with &s;ome verdigris, which, on an a&s;&s;ay, yielded from two to three drams of &s;ilver per 100 puds. No mark of gold has appeared, and from the &s;mall quantity of &s;ilver, &amp;c. no great things are expected.</P>
<P>The be&s;t mine is about 13 miles further off, up the Jurba, in the granite mountains. They work there on a quartz lode, with copper-green, one fathom &s;trong, to which adheres a brown mulm of gold alloy. Here they extract from 100 puds two and a half to three drams of gold-du&s;t: the vari-coloured quartz contains 23 pounds of copper, and &s;ix drams of &s;ilver; the green, mixt ochre yields 25 drams of &s;ilver, and the ferruginous ochre, two drams of &s;ilver, per 100 puds.</P>
<P>Between the Yjus and Jurba are many other try|ing-pits; but this mountain has not been &s;o &s;trictly examined as to give any great hopes.</P>
<P>An interpreter, whom I wanted for the continua|tion of my journey, being now arrived, I left this place on the 1&s;t of September, taking the &s;ame road as la&s;t year, travelling &s;traight to the &s;outh, towards the Jurba, where there are &s;ome Tartarian Jurts of the tribe Kaidan-Aimak. This tribe, and that of Arin&s;koi has one and the &s;ame governor, called <HI>Ba&s;chlyk.</HI> Part of the&s;e tribes has &s;ettled among the
<PB N="166" REF="169">
Tartars, about the brooks Te&s;s and Jurba. The tribe Kaidan-Aimak reckons 30 bows, and their elder <HI>(Ka&s;|nez)</HI> re&s;ides upon the Uybat. The tribe Buk Tjin Aimak. con&s;i&s;ts of 39 bows, who&s;e Ka&s;nez lives on the brook Koma. The tribe Ka&s;an Kaidan-Aimak has but 16 bows, and dwells high in the mountains on the river Kyfir. The&s;e Tartars and the Koibuls are chiefly employed in hunting of &s;ables in the moun|tains &s;ituate about the&s;e rivers and the Oi. Other Tartarian tribes may hunt there, but with the permi&s;|&s;ion of the&s;e, and on certain terms.</P>
<P>The little, river Uybat, which empties into the Abakan, &s;erves as a frontier-line to the Kat&s;chinzy Tartars, and tho&s;e of the Sajaian mountains; the former are under the juri&s;diction of Kra&s;najar&s;kaja, and the latter pay their tribute at Ku&s;nezkoi. As the &s;tep on both &s;ides the Uybat is not only very warm in winter, on account of the mountains, but has &s;carce any &s;now; the riche&s;t of the&s;e Tartars drive their flocks and herds here in autumn, and look on this di&s;trict as their be&s;t winter-pa&s;ture. The Sajaian Tar|tars dwell on the right &s;ide, and the others on the left. The &s;tep, full of old graves, is an evident proof that the Nomades fir&s;t &s;ettled here, and found the di&s;trict an advantageous &s;ituation.</P>
<P>On the 4th of September I continued my journey farther on the Uybat, and directed it thro' the Sajaian
<PB N="167" REF="170">
&s;tep towards the Little Syr. On the high fields in Dauria the <HI>Stellaria dichotoma</HI> was uncommonly abun|dant. It was now mo&s;tly dried up, in globular, round bu&s;hes, and rolled every where by the wind; for the calyxes of this plant, when dry, enclo&s;e the thick &s;eeds, &s;o as not to be &s;hed; and nature has, by a particular fore&s;ight, &s;o di&s;po&s;ed the flower-&s;talks, <HI>(pedunculi)</HI> that they bend backwards like a leg, after it has done blo&s;&s;oming, that they may not break, when the plant rolls upon the ground.</P>
<P>About 27 miles from the Syr, lies the Ru&s;&s;ian vil|lage Synowina, inhabited by pea&s;ants; and eight miles from this is a high mountain, called by the Tartars <HI>Temir</HI> (Iron) which, like the Kujum, two miles further towards the brook D&s;hakd&s;hul, is full of ochre-ne&s;ts, in a white matrix, where the antient miners (T&s;chudaki) &s;eem to have been very diligent. Many new attempts were made to work this mine, for the re&s;t of the ochres are mo&s;tly &s;erruginous, and the copper and &s;ilver ore of little value. During the modern works, they di&s;co|vered an adit &s;o narrow, that a boy could &s;carce creep through: this narrowne&s;s mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by time, which has &s;queezed the &s;ides together.</P>
<P>Between the Nyna and Syr, we left a remarkable lake, on our right, called by the Tartars <HI>Bulanny Kul,</HI> who &s;ay, that in winter, it makes a certain roar before

it freezes. As they pa&s;s it, they leave &s;ome &s;pray or &s;tone upon an adjacent mountain as a &s;acrifice, a u&s;ual, &s;uper&s;titious ceremony of the Siberian pagans.</P>
<P>On the greater river Syr are &s;everal Tartarian jurts, where I learned they had among them a famous Kahm, or &s;orcerer, whom the &s;pirits had deprived of one foot, and yet he jumped well. As this man was not at home, or had, probably, concealed him&s;elf, to avoid the trouble of making his exorci&s;ms before me, I ordered his magic dre&s;s to be brought to me; his drum was uncommonly pretty, more than an ell in diameter, and was painted green and red. Except the drum and its beater, the whole dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted only of a cap made of red cloth, edged with fox-&s;kin, and or|namented with &s;erpents' heads, having in the top a bu&s;h of owls' feathers, and about the borders were &s;everal ornaments of &s;triped &s;tuff, ermine-furs, &amp;c.

them, hold the ends of them in the fire, and with loud invocations lift them into the air, then divide them &s;uddenly into three parcels, between the fingers of the left hand, and, by &s;uch of the &s;ticks as do not pa&s;s between the fingers, they pre&s;age good or bad luck.</P>
<P>Fifteen miles further on, whil&s;t we changed hor&s;es, we were entertained with another Sajan &s;orcerer, called <HI>Stepan.</HI> He would have kept his art a &s;ecret, had not my people found out his drum, which he had concealed in another jurt. This was a bri&s;k, young fellow, who beat his drum, fir&s;t kneeling, and then &s;itting before the fire, and &s;ung his incantations in a very harmonious tune. Soon after this they grew more terrible, his motions were violent, and continued more and more &s;o, till he was &s;eemingly in a fit; he then bent backwards, with his heels and head to the ground, making a bow of his body, beating his drum at the &s;ame time, which pa&s;&s;ed ince&s;&s;antly under this bow from &s;ide to &s;ide. This difficult exerci&s;e he re|peated &s;everal times, and was the be&s;t part of his per|formance.</P>
<P>I rode this day, the 4th of September, to the mouth of the Aky&s;ch into the Abakan, where is an open di&s;trict. A church has been built within the la&s;t year, of which the baptized, Sajan Tartars are the pari&s;hio|ners. Here is no building but the church, the mi|ni&s;ter's hou&s;e, and that of the Ba&s;chlyk, or head of the
<PB N="170" REF="173">
tribe, who has embraced the chri&s;tian faith &s;ome time. The prie&s;t of this place is under the juri&s;diction of Abakan&s;koi, tho' the tribe of Saja belongs to the di&s;trict of Ku&s;nezkoi. The&s;e chri&s;tian Tartars con|tributed to the building the church, and the &s;tipend of the mini&s;ter, whil&s;t tho&s;e who remain pagans adhere to their pagan cu&s;toms. Some of them had commenced hu&s;bandmen. Others wander, in &s;ummer-time, with their flocks and herds, along the brooks into the cool mountains, and return in winter to the &s;nowle&s;s &s;teps about the Abakan. The whole con&s;i&s;ts only of 150 men, who pay a tribute, or ja&s;&s;ack, of three rubles per bow. Their complexion and con&s;titution is not at all &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Tartars of Kat&s;chinzkoi, but are more like the Beltirs, and other Tartars who inhabit the mountains of Ku&s;mezkoi. Few of their faces are like the Kalmucks, but their features are truly Tartarian. They are very hairy about the chin and body, and their limbs and body are larger and &s;tronger than the Kat&s;chinzians. It &s;eems that the&s;e men, who inhabit &s;uch a wild, mountainous di&s;trict, have taken care not to mix their progeny with Mon|galian blood.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t wealthy of them po&s;&s;e&s;s from 80 to 100 hor&s;es, as many cows, and &s;ome hundreds of &s;heep. Poorer ones have hardly 10 or 20 head of large cat|tle, which, among the&s;e &s;tep-people, are &s;ufficient to maintain a family. Their &s;heep, like tho&s;e of the

<PB N="171" REF="175">
Tartars in the Jeni&s;ei, have little, fat tails, and many differ little from Ru&s;&s;ian &s;heep, and are &s;el|dom larger. It is peculiar to the north-ea&s;t of A&s;ia, that the long-tailed breed of &s;heep has generally &s;uch a fat lump. Be&s;ides agriculture, the Sajan Tartars dig al&s;o all &s;orts of roots and plants for food, and, like the Tungu&s;e, &s;earch for them in the mice-holes. The following are the roots which the poor Tartars, in general &s;cattered about the Jeni&s;ei and Ku&s;nezkoi-mountains, collect, and almo&s;t live on, and of which they make a winter-provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is the dog's-tooth root <HI>(Erythronium)</HI> called here <HI>Be&s;s.</HI> It is the principal bu&s;ine&s;s of the women to dig this root in the month of May; hence this month is called, by the Beltir and Sajan Tartars, <HI>Be&s;s|ai.</HI> As the&s;e roots lie four or five inches under a tough turf, they u&s;e a particular, pointed &s;pade for digging them. They force the &s;pade into the ground with the foot, and the root is then ea&s;y to come at; having cleaned them, they put them in water to &s;oak, then wind them round with ba&s;s, and dry them. When dre&s;&s;ed, they are boiled gently in water, till they are &s;oft, and eaten with milk or cream. They re&s;emble in ta&s;te the rawne&s;s of wheat-flour, mixt up with water and eggs, and are very indige&s;tible. Another root eaten by the Kat&s;chinzkoi Tartars, is that of the common Siberian Piony. This is dried for the win|ter, and is mo&s;tly eaten, ground in &s;oup with meat, and
<PB N="172" REF="176">
is called <HI>Ure.</HI> The u&s;e of the common, and deep red bunch-lilies, the former of which, <HI>Lilium Martagon,</HI> is called <HI>Sary</HI> (yellow) <HI>Schep,</HI> the latter <HI>Lilium Pom|ponium, A&s;chep</HI> (white); and the Beltirs call the month July, in which it is collected, <HI>A&s;chep-ai.</HI> What they do not eat raw, they keep, and eat, roa&s;ted in the cinders, like che&s;nuts, or boiled in water, with milk and butter. The Sajan Tartars collect a great quantity of the red lily-roots from the provi&s;ion-holes of the grey &s;tep|mou&s;e <HI>(Mus &s;ocialis)</HI> or el&s;e dig it with the above|mentioned &s;pades.</P>
<P>They al&s;o dig roots of the &s;angui&s;orbia, the knotty fumitory, the large bell-flowers <HI>(camp. lilifolia),</HI> certain thi&s;tle <HI>(carduus &s;eratuloides),</HI> the viper herb <HI>(polygonunt viviparum);</HI> al&s;o a kind of herb called <HI>&s;o&s;ack,</HI> which &s;carce a wild boar will touch. I heard of another plant, called <HI>u&s;kum,</HI> but had not an opportunity of &s;eeing it; nay, I have been told that the poor Tar|tars, if very hungry, will eat the bark of the white pine-tree.</P>
<P>A dainty which they al&s;o dre&s;s for winter-food is the bird-cherry, which they grind, kernel and all, and eat the coar&s;e meal in milk as a de&s;ert. It would be idle to mention all the berries they eat in &s;ummer-time. The fre&s;h roots of hips, or wild ro&s;es, they chop and boil for tea. They make al&s;o a di&s;h with milk and the groats of buck-wheat, which I was told they did in the following manner: after wa&s;hing the grain in
<PB N="173" REF="177">
water, and taking off &s;uch as is light, and &s;wims at top, which is thrown away, they put the re&s;t; into a wet bag, and let it lie 10 or 12 hours to &s;oak, then dry it a little over an iron &s;tove, till it becomes rather hard, which they try by the teeth; if quite dry, when pounded in their mortars, which is a hollowed trunk of a tree, it would become flour; but being a little moi&s;t, when pounded, it becomes groats; for having dried them on a &s;tove, the hu&s;ks get loo&s;e, and, in beating, come off from the body, and are cleared from the body of the grain by the hand or a winnow. The grain thus prepared, is &s;omewhat tran&s;parent, of a yellowi&s;h colour, and is much improved in ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Of medicines, and other plants for dome&s;tic u&s;e, I ob&s;erved the following: the <HI>Lychnis Chalcedonica,</HI> which grows in the vallies. The flowers of this plant are u&s;ed as &s;oap, and the Ru&s;&s;ians call it <HI>Tatar&s;koi muilo</HI> (Tartar &s;oap). The <HI>ono&s;ma echioides,</HI> which grows in the &s;teps about the Abakan, the Tartar girls u&s;e as paint for their cheeks. The &s;avin-tree, and the <HI>rho|dodendron chry&s;anthum,</HI> which will be mentioned more particularly below, are medicines known for the &s;ame u&s;e among the Tartars and Ru&s;&s;ians in the Jeni&s;ei. The Tartars al&s;o dig the rhaphontic for internal u&s;e. The mo&s;t common tea-plant here is the <HI>&s;axifraga cra&s;&s;i|folia,</HI> and the a&s;tringent decoction of the roots is &s;uc|ce&s;sfully u&s;ed by the mountain-Tartars for loo&s;ene&s;s of the belly and feveri&s;h complaints.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="178">Among&s;t the plants of &s;ome utility in the Pagan, Tartar economy, are the hemp-nettle, and little <HI>ro|binea pygmea.</HI> Of the former they make a coar&s;e yarn, for &s;trings of &s;elf-&s;hooting bows, which they &s;et out in Autumn, and the tough roots of the latter they u&s;e as ba&s;t. They al&s;o gather the Autumn leaves of the <HI>he|merocallis,</HI> to make &s;oft mats and &s;addle-cu&s;hions, which they twi&s;t together in a very pretty manner.</P>
<P>It is not that all the&s;e roots and plants are u&s;ed by one and the &s;ame tribe of Tartars; but I have thrown them together, as u&s;ed in general by &s;ome or other of the Tartar tribes, for any u&s;eful purpo&s;es my readers may plea&s;e to try them.</P>
<P>On the fifth of September I continued my journey up the Abakan, more to the South, and to the mo&s;t remote Ru&s;&s;ian dwellings on the Ta&s;chtyp. As &s;oon as we cro&s;s the watry A&s;ky&s;ch, we are in the di&s;trict of the Beltirs, who&s;e pa&s;tures are along the Abakan, and who claim the right bank of it. Six miles from this is the winter-re&s;idence of Epti&s;ch, the pre&s;ent Ba&s;chlyk of the Beltir Tartars and the Birju&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The Beltirs con&s;i&s;t at pre&s;ent of 150 tributary men, who altogether pay a Ja&s;&s;ack of 300 rubles. Like the Saja-Tartars, they are under the juri&s;diction of Ku&s;nezkoi, and have a &s;trong re&s;emblance to them in countenance, manner and language. Many of them
<PB N="175" REF="179">
are rich in cattle and &s;heep, and mo&s;t of them follow hu&s;bandry. September is their harve&s;t-month, which, like the Germans, they call <HI>Orgok-ai.</HI> They thre&s;h their corn abroad in the field, and burn the &s;traw on the ground. Their chief crops are &s;ummer-corn <HI>(ary&s;ch),</HI> particularly barley <HI>(a&s;ch)</HI> of which they make groats. The ground is turned up with a pick-axe, called by them <HI>abyl;</HI> but &s;ome have begun to make u&s;e of a plough, which they call <HI>&s;alda.</HI> In autumn, when they have plenty of milk, from which &s;ome neighbour or other is always di&s;tilling brandy, they are &s;eldom to be found &s;ober but in the morning.</P>
<P>The rich Beltirs have generally two or more wives, which is &s;eldom the ca&s;e among the Tartars in the Jeni&s;ei. Being &s;ub&s;tantial men, they are ob&s;tinate in their way of thinking, and could not be brought over to chri&s;tianity, of cour&s;e are rank heathens, and are al|ways with their kamens or &s;orcerers. Of all the Siberian nations, the Beltirs and the Teleutes of Kumezkoi, with &s;ome few mountaineers, are the only Tartars who do not bury their dead, but put them in coffins, and place them in trees in &s;ome remote parts of the woods. The Sajan Tartars, who are not baptized, do this le&s;s frequently: the Beltirs will not confe&s;s it; and I &s;hould, perhaps, not have found it out, if, when I was col|lecting the plants, I had not met with &s;uch a burying-place in a fore&s;t upon the Ta&s;chtyp, where there was placed a young woman and her mother, who died out
<PB N="176" REF="180">
of a Beltir family that &s;pent the winter here. The coffins were made of rough-hewn boards, tied together with ropes, and in the &s;ame manner a board was placed on the top, in&s;tead of a cover, and over it lay &s;ome birch-bark. The coffins were di&s;tant from each other about 50 fathoms, tied with ropes over two branches of two, old larch-trees, &s;o low that a Co&s;&s;ack with me could ea&s;ily climb and look into the coffin, though the trunk below the branches was cleared of its boughs. The body was in its full dre&s;s, and all &s;orts of wo|men's cloaths lying near the head. On one &s;ide was a bag with groats, a pot with fat and remnants of dried meat, the &s;pade with which they dig roots, a crooked knife in a ca&s;e, an axe, and a hor&s;e-whip, with a &s;addle between her legs, that &s;he might be ready to ride in the other world. One corp&s;e had the head turned towards the we&s;t, and the other to the ea&s;t: but this may be no certain rule. On the tree next &s;uch corp&s;e, hung the &s;kin of a hor&s;e, &s;laughtered on the occa&s;ion, with the tail and hoofs hung on a &s;tripped branch, the head whole, bitted and bridled, on another branch. Into the coffin with a man, they put their be&s;t clothes, bow and quiver; and, if the decea&s;ed was fond of mu&s;ic, his three-&s;tringed lute, <HI>Kobys,</HI> and his horizontal harp <HI>jattagan,</HI> and they &s;acrifice at his death, his be&s;t hor&s;e. Seven days after, among the rich, a &s;econd hor&s;e and a mare are &s;laughtered, and the requiem is twice or thrice a year celebrated by the relations. It is &s;o|lemnized but once to the memory of a poor man, and
<FIGURE>

<HEAD>A BELTIR CEMETERY</HEAD>

<PB N="177" REF="182">
on that occa&s;ion they hang near the decea&s;ed, a ve&s;&s;el of brandy, and the bones of the victim are carefully burnt. The Beltirs however are &s;aid, in certain ca&s;es, to bury their dead, and cover the grave with &s;tones.</P>
<P>Like the Katchinzkoi Tartars, the Beltirs have a cu&s;tom of hanging up little rags and &s;kins of animals about their tents. Among &s;ome I met al&s;o with the Buratian rag idols <HI>(ongon)</HI> con&s;ecrated by the magi|cians at &s;acrifices.</P>
<P>In this di&s;trict up the A&s;ky&s;ch, begins that remark|able &s;tep which extends between the mountains and the low grounds of the Abakan, and is covered more than any di&s;trict on the Jeni&s;ei, with old tombs and monu|ments of an extraordinary &s;ize and appearance. Among the&s;e graves, which are &s;urrounded with a &s;quare wall of granite rock and rai&s;ed with the walls, partly like a flat, earth hillock, and partly paved with &s;mall granites, are many &s;tones ornamented with a rough &s;culpture of human faces, de&s;erving a more particular de&s;cription, which, with other &s;tone images on the &s;teps of the Jeni|&s;ei, have been erected long before the time of the Kir|gue&s;e. A mile and an half above the winter-habitation of the Beltir chief, &s;tood two, very narrow &s;tones, &s;even feet high, flat on both &s;ides, narrower at the top, and truncated, which now lie along upon the ground. Both have, at the upper end, the features of a human face, quite flat, cut out on them; one of which is about
<PB N="178" REF="183">
half an ell higher than the other, and called, by the Tartars, <HI>Ku&s;s Ta&s;ch</HI> (the daughter), and has, on the edge of the border, on the right of the face, carved figures of the two-bunched camel, from top to bot|tom; and, on the other edge, the gha&s;tly image of a child.</P>
<P>The Beltirs call the other &s;tone, <HI>Ku&s;i Ta&s;ch</HI> (man-&s;tone). On its right edge, below, is cut a man on hor&s;eback, with his lance before him, on which a flag hangs; and, a little higher, is carved a bent bow, with an arrow on it, tolerably large and plain. On the other edge are different figures, rendered undi&s;tingui&s;hable by time; on the top is a lance, with a triple flag; and farther below, &s;ome &s;quare lines and the form of a boat; and, at the bottom, the figure of a child.</P>
<P>Some hundred fathoms from the&s;e &s;tones, on the we&s;t &s;ide of a large tomb, encompa&s;&s;ed with granites, and &s;urrounded with many others, &s;tands a piece of large granite-rock, as high as a man, &s;o edged at the top that its point and carved &s;ide turns ea&s;twards to the tomb. Near the point of this granite is a large female face, much more relieved than on other &s;tones, having its mouth wide open, and very much worn and decayed by time. On the middle of the &s;tone, on the &s;ame &s;ide, are &s;ome &s;quare lines, and elegant carved drawings, but quite in&s;ignificant. This piece of rock is known, among the heathen Tartars of this di&s;trict, by the
<PB N="179" REF="184">
name of <HI>Kurtejak-ta&s;ch</HI> (woman's &s;tone), or <HI>Ulu Kurte|jak</HI> (the big woman); and is indu&s;triou&s;ly invoked for good luck in &s;able-hunting, by the heathens that pa&s;s this way. They feed it devoutly, by &s;mearing and filling its mouth with fat or butter.</P>
<P>But, a mile and an half higher up the Abakan, is the fine&s;t monument I have &s;een among all Siberian antiquities. This is a tomb, four fathoms high, and 150 paces in circumference, rai&s;ed upon an eminence, &s;o as to be &s;een at a great di&s;tance. Four other tu|muli lying about, north-we&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t, at a good di&s;tance, form a triangle with the great one; in the opening of which, we&s;twards from the large&s;t tumulus, at 200 paces from it, three long &s;quare-&s;ided &s;and-rock &s;tones, rather narrower at the top, are &s;o placed, that their flat &s;ides face the north and &s;outh, each &s;tone &s;tanding about four feet from the other. On the north|ernmo&s;t of the&s;e &s;tones, on the edge that faces the ea&s;t, a very long but di&s;tingui&s;hable face is &s;culptured out, and much relieved, which takes up the length of the &s;tone. This is called, by the Tartars, <HI>Kit&s;chi Kurtejak</HI> (the little woman). Neither of the other &s;tones have any thing remarkable, but their ea&s;tern edge being hewn like the &s;cales of a fi&s;h. On the flat &s;ide of the &s;tone, ornamented with the face, are &s;ome drawings. A very large &s;tone, &s;tanding on the we&s;t of the above-mentioned grave, more than three ells high, and one and an half wide, has a great many figures on the &s;outh-&s;ide,
<PB N="180" REF="185">
which, as far as I could di&s;tingui&s;h, are a kind of Tartar hieroglyphics, as in&s;criptions, drawn or &s;cratched on their tomb-&s;tones. Some of the&s;e pieces are probably the &s;ign-manual of the decea&s;ed; for the pagans in Siberia, like the common people in Ru&s;&s;ia, who cannot write, have a particular &s;ignature, which they u&s;e to writings in&s;tead of their name, and which is acknowledged as valid by their courts of ju|dicature.</P>
<P>Among the great number of tombs of the fine win|ter-plains on the Abakan, there are few but what are injured: however, as I ob&s;erved &s;ome not dug into, and de&s;irous of knowing &s;omething of their internal &s;truc|ture, I ordered a tent to be erected near the Kurtujak Ta&s;ch, determining to pa&s;s the night here, and wait the opening of one of the&s;e hills. All the monuments about the Abakan are &s;o &s;imilar externally, that they mu&s;t have been tombs of the &s;ame nation. The only difference is, that &s;ome have the ground flat within the &s;quare walls, and others rai&s;ed, which may be a di&s;tinction only of rank, or tribe. The granite &s;tones that border the&s;e graves lay mo&s;tly along, with one edge on the ground; none &s;et up an end, but in the north-ea&s;t, &s;outh-ea&s;t, and &s;outh-we&s;t angles. Tho&s;e graves which have the large&s;t &s;tones, are not wholly &s;urrounded with them: &s;ome have only a long &s;tone, like a pila&s;ter, inclining over the grave. On tho&s;e graves which lie near the mountains, there is &s;carce a
<PB N="181" REF="186">
&s;tone to be &s;een, as the &s;now and rain from the moun|tains have wa&s;hed the earth over them. In &s;ome, the &s;pace within the walls is divided into two or three parts, by rows of &s;tones placed on end, and running from ea&s;t to we&s;t; one of which is generally larger, and &s;tands higher than the re&s;t. The&s;e are apparently graves in which &s;everal per&s;ons of one family are buried. The chief difference in the&s;e tombs is, that &s;ome are paved on the top with granite-&s;tone, and others only filled up with earth. I ordered one of the former, which &s;eemed to be one entire hill, to be opened, but no regular coffin was found, only a mixture of decayed bones of &s;everal bodies, laid with the legs towards each other. The&s;e relicks were found at the depth of four feet and a half, and in vi&s;ible di&s;order. With the bones were found broken pieces of earthen ve&s;&s;els, various large cooking-ba&s;ons, a bead of a greeni&s;h-white, ena|melled &s;ub&s;tance; and, among the bones, a cheek-bone, with teeth of moderate &s;ize; but no other parts of the head, or other &s;mall bones, were to be found. In an|other grave, only filled with earth, and quite flat at top, were found, at the depth of not quite four feet and a half, &s;ome large granite-&s;tones, lying flat, but the earth filled up beneath them; yet it was plainly to be &s;een, that there was a long, &s;quare &s;pace, made with &s;tones, running ea&s;t and we&s;t. Here were found the bones of a man, in &s;uch order, as to &s;ee that he was laid with his head towards the ea&s;t; but of the &s;cull and teeth nothing was remaining; and every other bone
<PB N="182" REF="187">
was very imperfect and &s;oft. About the head were &s;ome &s;ingle hor&s;e and ox-bones; on the right, an ear|then boiling-ve&s;&s;el, &s;queezed to pieces by &s;tones laid on it, and within it a brown du&s;t was perceptible. On the left, the undi&s;tingui&s;hable remains of &s;ome piece of crooked wood; but, in the very middle, near where the head lay, a very thin round piece of leaf-gold, as big as half a ruble, bent over a rai&s;ed copper button, quite rotten with verdigrea&s;e, perhaps the button of a woman's cap. The great decay of the&s;e bones, in &s;o &s;andy a &s;oil, is an indi&s;putable proof of the high anti|quity of the&s;e tombs. Though we di&s;covered but little that was curious, yet I wi&s;hed to open other tombs; but having no good diggers, or grave-&s;earchers, among the pea&s;ants that attended me, I was obliged to give it up.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, by the Ru&s;&s;ian grave-&s;earchers here, that the common graves contain &s;mall gold and &s;ilver ve&s;|&s;els; but are not &s;o rich in other pieces of in&s;tructive antiquity as the rai&s;ed earth-tombs. Indeed, I was more plea&s;ed with the antiquities found with the bodies of the fir&s;t tomb we opened, than with the piece of gold in the other. Perhaps, tho&s;e interred in the rai&s;ed tu|muli, were of that ancient nation who have left &s;o many traces of their knowledge in metallurgy. Contented, therefore, with what I had &s;een, I went, on the 6th, towards the Ta&s;chtyp. At the di&s;tance of four miles, I cro&s;&s;ed the brook I&s;&s;e, and changed hor&s;es at the
<PB N="183" REF="188">
Kobynzian jurts, on the brook Tye. Here I met the elders of three Tartarean tribes, Kobyn, Kargin, and Kain, who are under the juri&s;diction of Kunezkoi, and who, like the Beltirs, received me with great a&s;fability. The tribe Kobyn con&s;i&s;ts of 53 bows; that of Kargin, of 40; which la&s;t, with &s;ome other tribes of mountain|eers, bear the common name of <HI>Birja&s;&s;es.</HI> The former once inhabited the mountains, and lived wretchedly on hunting; but &s;ince they have &s;ettled on the Tye and Abakan, in the territories of the Beltirs, they are grown rather &s;ub&s;tantial, by adding the breeding of cattle to their employ of hunting. In their language, make, man|ners, and way of living, they do not differ from the Beltirs; and live, like all the Tartars about the Jeni|&s;ei, in jurts, covered in &s;ummer with birch bark, and in winter with &s;heep-wool felts.</P>
<P>There was here, in the &s;outhern parts of the more open mountains, an incredible number of partridges, who, in winter, find abundance of food in the warm and &s;nowle&s;s meridional parts of the rocky mountains, and who run about in crowds very tame, and not the lea&s;t &s;hy.</P>
<P>Ta&s;chtypkaja is the mo&s;t remote Ru&s;&s;ian village on the wa&s;te part of the Mongalian frontiers, which, from the Ob to the Jeni&s;ei, is not yet provided with for|tre&s;&s;es and regular troops. It is &s;ituated at the bottom of the high mountains, where woods begin to cover
<PB N="184" REF="189">
their tops. On the left of the Ta&s;chtyp are five dwell|ings, inhabited by Co&s;&s;acks from Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, who voluntarily offered to do the frontier-duty, which u&s;ed to be done by Tartars. This people have found the place excellently adapted for agriculture, breeding of cattle, and hunting. Sometimes the corn &s;uffers by early, white fro&s;ts, and &s;ometimes by caterpillars; but, on the whole, the harve&s;t is u&s;ually a good one. For breeding of cattle, they have the fine&s;t meadows; and it is a rich place for hunting. There are indeed but few &s;ables; but the&s;e they can procure from the poor Tartars, by giving them bread and groats in exchange. In fact, this di&s;trict well de&s;erves numerous population. The Ta&s;chtyp is a large brook which, in &s;pring and rainy weather, flows &s;o plentifully, that, on the &s;hal|lowe&s;t &s;pots, it is &s;carcely fordable by hor&s;es. It flows here between two, high, chalk mountains, which extend further up and down the Abakan, are from hence co|vered with larch-trees and fir-woods, inter&s;ected with fine, open vallies. From the village, to its mouth in the Abakan, it is about 22 miles. On the other &s;ide of the frontier, which is Chine&s;e Mongalia, no Mongols live, but a people called <HI>Sojet,</HI> that &s;ub&s;i&s;t on hunting, keep rein-deer, and, in language and blood, &s;eem related to the Motores, on the Oi and Tuba, and of cour&s;e to the Koibales and Samojedes. Before the Chine&s;e had any guards on their frontiers, there was always here a road of communication between Siberia and Mongalia.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="190">Be&s;ides the frontier-mark of this place, there is an|other ea&s;twards, on the Jeni&s;ei, at the mouth of the Kenit&s;chuk, into that river; but there is no getting to it, except over the ice, in winter.</P>
<P>About the Ta&s;chtyp are Tartars of the tribes of Kain and Kobyn. The former has but 25 military men; but the tribe Schors, further down the Ma&s;na, has 50. As the&s;e have no opportunity for agriculture, and are poor in cattle, their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence con&s;i&s;ts in wild roots and hunting, living in wilderne&s;&s;es inacce&s;&s;ible to others, and being rank heathens. In winter they wan|der, with their little cattle, down the Ta&s;chtyp, where the &s;now does not fall too deep. The &s;ables being &s;carce in this di&s;trict, they go to the wild mora&s;&s;es, on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of the Jeni&s;ei, in the di&s;trict of Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, to catch this animal, in order to pay their tribute. But the Koibales, who pretend to claim that di&s;trict, will not &s;uffer them to hunt with nets, but often take their in&s;truments and toils from them.</P>
<P>I continued at Ta&s;chtyp on the 7th of September, and &s;pent the whole day in climbing the mountains along the brook, in &s;earch of plants. Underneath a &s;teep rock, after having had the good luck to climb up, a young bear, by the rattling of a falling &s;tone, was moved from his abode, took flight, and as we, by hal|looing and &s;houting, frightened him &s;till more, he &s;wam through the Ta&s;chtyp, in order to hide him&s;elf in an
<PB N="186" REF="191">
adjacent wood. I &s;ent a Tartar, with this intelligence, to the next jurts; and, in le&s;s than half an hour, a num|ber of armed Tartars, on hor&s;eback, ha&s;tened on all &s;ides, pur&s;uing the bear clo&s;e through an open field, over which he wanted to take refuge in a di&s;tant moun|tain. They killed him in this field, and we had the plea&s;ure of &s;urveying the chace from the high mountain; and were much a&s;toni&s;hed at the courage of a Tartarean hor&s;e, which overtook the bear fir&s;t, and beat him down on the rocky ground with his fore-feet, previous to his being killed.</P>
<P>The plants here are common to the di&s;tricts of Dauria, and the mountains in the ea&s;t of Siberia. On the chalky mountains grows, in many places, the &s;avin-tree <HI>(Juniperus Sabina).</HI> This tree is occa&s;ionally con|veyed to Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja and Tom&s;koi, as a famous, do|me&s;tic remedy; the knowledge of which &s;eems to have originated from the Tartars; and the name they give it, <HI>Art&s;chin,</HI> the Ru&s;&s;ians have adopted. They u&s;e its branches, not only &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly to &s;moke off malicious &s;pirits, but the &s;ame is al&s;o &s;erviceable to &s;ick children; and, in di&s;orders of the head, to grown people: and, if the &s;moke will not operate with efficacy, they &s;wallow &s;ome of it. It is al&s;o &s;aid to be of great &s;ervice for various di&s;orders of the belly.</P>
<P>But a more valuable plant &s;till in all Chine&s;e di&s;|orders, is a fine &s;pecies of &s;now-ro&s;e (de&s;cribed fully

in Flor. Sibir. vol. iv. page 121, Tab. 54), which grows here on low bu&s;hes; as al&s;o on the lofty Alps, and in Dauria; with &s;ulphur-yellow flower-bunches <HI>(Rhodo|dendron Chry&s;anthum),</HI> and hard and thick leaves, like tho&s;e of lauro cra&s;us. This rare plant likes the rocky mo&s;&s;y caps of the &s;now-mountains in Dauria, where it is called, by the common people, <HI>T&s;chernogrif</HI> and <HI>Kelar&s;k,</HI> and has been taken notice of by Mr. <HI>Sokolof,</HI> on the bare &s;ummits of the partition-mountains, &s;ituated between the &s;ources of the Kirkun and T&s;chikoi. It is gathered here on two lofty mountains on the Jeni&s;ei, where it gows; and al&s;o, abundantly, about the roads and paths that lead to the frontier-marks, by the Co&s;&s;ack &s;oldiers, who carry it home to their wives and relations, as a fine medicine. The Tartars call it <HI>Schu,</HI> drinking only its leaves boiled in water, in moderate quantities, as a whole&s;ome tea. This tea, however, has no very &s;en&s;ible operation, or efficacy, unle&s;s made too &s;trong, when it attacks the head. But if &s;ome of its &s;mall branches, with their leaves, are put into a glazed pan, covered clo&s;e down, and &s;uffered to boil with water over a &s;tove; it makes a &s;trong, bitter and brown liquor, which, if taken internally, throws the patient into a feveri&s;h, drunken-like &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility; during which, the internal parts, or limbs affected, are in an ince&s;&s;ant motion. This intoxication quits the patient &s;ooner than that of &s;pirituous liquors, and leaves no head-ach, nor the lea&s;t in di&s;po&s;ition; and commonly, after once or twice taking c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s the di&s;order, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="188" REF="194">
part. The heat, excited by it, makes the patient very thir&s;ty, and if he drinks any cold water, will be attended with violent vomiting; but this vomiting is &s;alutary, and particularly &s;erviceable in all complaints of the belly. The Co&s;&s;acks u&s;e it in all rheumatic ca&s;es, and chronic pains in the limbs, which it is &s;aid to cure in|fallibly, by a violent and continual twitching in tho&s;e limbs. It is al&s;o &s;aid to mitigate pains in the limbs, ari&s;ing from, that &s;courge of mankind, the venereal di&s;|ea&s;e; and I &s;aw living in&s;tances, in Dauria, where it cured this di&s;order: however, this plant mu&s;t certainly be cla&s;&s;ed among the &s;pecific, &s;trong, vegetable reme|dies; and might, by care, and proper management of able phy&s;icians, become an excellent application in all podagrical, arthritic complaints, and internal, chronic ob&s;tructions of the bowels; and de&s;erves, therefore, every experiment to be made of it. The above-men|tioned effects I wrote down, not only on the univer&s;al report of numbers of common people, who had expe|rienced its virtues, but even on the a&s;&s;ertion of Mr. <HI>Sokolof,</HI> who u&s;ed it with &s;ucce&s;s on his return from Dauria, when he was rendered quite weak and ill by an ob&s;tructed diarrhoea. I mu&s;t al&s;o add, that the Co&s;&s;acks generally culled this plant in autumn, when it is in &s;eed, and many of its leaves are become yellow. How much more efficacious, therefore, mu&s;t it be, if gathered earlier, whil&s;t in bloom! It blo&s;&s;oms in the beginning of July, and &s;oon lo&s;es its beauty, like all mountain-plants. It has been remarked, that &s;tags, and
<PB N="189" REF="195">
the Siberian mu&s;cus, devour its leaves, without any in|toxicating effects. I found &s;ome in the &s;tomach of the former. Probably this plant, like the Kalmia of North-America, may be detrimental to the &s;tag, but not to other dome&s;tic animals.</P>
<P>The river Abakan, where we cro&s;&s;ed, is more than 80 fathoms broad, very deep, as rapid as an arrow, and difficult to pa&s;s; however, having prepared a ferry, we effected it; and in my way to Sajan&s;koi-O&s;trog, a di&s;tance of 82 miles, I pa&s;&s;ed the night of the 9th of September in the jurts of the Koibales, about four miles from the Jeni&s;ei, and eight from Sa|jan&s;koi-O&s;trog.</P>
<P>The Koibales, with whom I got acquainted this day, are a very different &s;et of people from all the pagan Tartars hitherto mentioned; not in their per&s;ons, manner of living, and dre&s;s, but in appearance and language, and, of cour&s;e, in origin. Their language is much like that of the Samojedes; and, though rendered confu&s;ed by a &s;trong mixture of Tartar, yet it may probably be concluded, from the con&s;iderable re|mains of the former language among the Koibal hordes, Motores, &amp;c. that this, and other &s;cattered tribes, mu&s;t be a remnant of the Samojede nations, driven from their ancient abodes, as far as the Dolar countries. The following li&s;t of words is a &s;ufficient proof of the re&s;emblance of the languages of tho&s;e na|tions;
<PB N="190" REF="196">
and that of the Motores &s;eems to be mo&s;t like the Samojede.</P>

<P>Of the Koibales, round the Jeni&s;ei, they reckon 14 tribes, all which contain only 384 men who pay tri|bute. They are almo&s;t all baptized, and have laid their pagan cu&s;toms a&s;ide, at lea&s;t publicly. Aged and full-grown people they bury in the ground; but children, when dead, they expo&s;e on trees, as do the Beltirs. They are not very opulent in cattle, but live to|lerably well by hunting and agriculture; yet &s;ome of
<PB N="191" REF="197">
them will po&s;&s;e&s;s a hundred hor&s;es: they u&s;e the Ru&s;&s;ian plough <HI>Saban;</HI> &s;ow more grain than they want, and &s;ell the overplus to the Tartars. They ga|ther al&s;o more wild-flax and nettles than the Tartars, and make ropes of them. Many have wooden, win|ter-dwellings; and even tho&s;e who wander about in tents, keep poultry. They hunt in large companies, and kill a great many &s;ables, beavers and otters, which they claim an exclu&s;ive right to: their fir&s;t hunting-&s;ea&s;on is at the end of Augu&s;t. In Decem|ber and January they catch &s;ables, beavers, otters, lynxes, and other &s;carce and dear animals; but in March they hunt elks and &s;tags in their &s;now-&s;cates. Their furs are mo&s;tly conveyed by commi&s;&s;ion to Ku&s;|nezkoi; but they pay their tribute in the hides of elks and &s;tags, and make up any deficiency in money. They catch the hyena in the following manner. This animal is &s;aid to follow the track of foxes, in order to &s;hare their prey; they, therefore, fix traps and &s;elf-&s;hooting bows about &s;uch tracks, to which the hyena falls a victim fir&s;t. When the Koibales are hunting in the winter-time, on the mountainous wildnerne&s;&s;es, where their hor&s;es cannot feed on account of the deep &s;now, they &s;earch for tho&s;e &s;tores of hay, laid up, in con&s;iderable heaps, under the rocks, or about the trees, by the little cliff-hare <HI>(lepus alpinus).</HI> The&s;e heaps con&s;i&s;t of the mo&s;t juicy plants, and, among the re&s;t, a great deal of wolf's-bane; but it does not hurt the hor&s;es. About the&s;e heaps are many deep paths,
<PB N="192" REF="198">
in which the&s;e little, indu&s;trious animals run up and down.</P>
<P>There are but few, old cu&s;toms remaining among the Koibales. Their women wear tre&s;&s;es, hanging to the &s;houlders; and caps like tho&s;e of the Mongols. They are delivered of their children kneeling, and &s;upported by &s;ome man, but a female friend performs the office of the midwife. The lying-in woman is fed with a great deal of butter and fat meat, and is not &s;uffered to drink any thing cold for the fir&s;t three days, at the expiration of which time &s;he returns to her bu|&s;ine&s;s; but during her &s;tate of impurity, which is ele|ven days, or a fortnight, &s;he mu&s;t not dre&s;s any vic|tuals for her hu&s;band. In the fir&s;t &s;even days &s;he is wa&s;hed thrice; and, after this, once a month for &s;ome time; but her la&s;t purification is being &s;moked with the Irwen, which is the Sabin of Linnaeus.</P>
<P>I will &s;ay a few words here of the Motores in parti|cular. There are &s;carce 10 families of them, the &s;mall-pox having twice raged among them. Formerly there were about 30, who paid tribute, and the&s;e re|&s;ided about the mountains beyond Sajan&s;koi-O&s;trog, till they were removed from the frontiers towards Abakan&s;koi, and beyond the Tuba. Their dre&s;s and cloaths &s;till differ from the Koibales. They are poor, po&s;&s;e&s;s but little cattle, and live chiefly by hunting, and &s;erving the Ru&s;&s;ians. The few there are, were
<PB N="193" REF="199">
baptized about 30 years ago, and formerly placed their dead, between three boards, upon trees. To keep their tents warm, they cover them in winter with hay, at other times with birch-bark. Their doors are made in the ea&s;t &s;ide, and they either cannot or will not remember their former &s;uper&s;titions.</P>
<P>Here is a mine al&s;o in this neighbourhood, that contains &s;ilver, but the&s;e works are at pre&s;ent &s;u&s;|pended. On the 11th of September, having pre|pared every thing for cro&s;&s;ing the Jeni&s;ei, which is here only 200 fathoms wide, we got our waggons over, but with difficulty.</P>
<P>In the village where we &s;lept, I met with an old pea&s;ant, who was not a &s;earcher of ore, but an ex|perienced digger of hidden trea&s;ures. He made no &s;ecret of his art; and to him and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants am I indebted for &s;everal good accounts of the nature of the ancient tombs on the Jeni&s;ei, and am therefore le&s;s &s;crupulous of committing them to paper, con|vinced, by viewing fre&s;h-opened tombs, of the truth of what he told me.</P>
<P>The ancient tombs, he &s;aid, might be divided into two kinds; the fir&s;t of which con&s;i&s;ted of tombs of &s;tone, the other of earth-hills, &s;urrounded with &s;tone. In &s;tone-graves bodies are often found, de&s;cribed as above; their head to the ea&s;t, in a &s;epulchre, or ca&s;e,
<PB N="194" REF="200">
made of &s;tones. The bones of the head are chiefly mouldered into du&s;t. On the right &s;ide of the head are generally found large, earthen ba&s;ons, and relicks of common, wooden hou&s;ehold-furniture. In the principal graves of this kind, which differed not ex|ternally from the re&s;t, except in the &s;ize of the &s;tones made u&s;e of, have been found elegant, &s;ilver ve&s;&s;els, gold plates, buttons, and other hornaments; hor&s;e-furniture, made of iron, inlaid or plated with gold and &s;ilver, and &s;ometimes, though very rare, copper-furniture. Sometimes the bones of burnt bodies have been found in a little &s;pace ca&s;ed with &s;tone.</P>
<P>The large grave-hills, made of earth only, are &s;till more remarkable, and &s;eem to belong to a very diffe|rent nation. The&s;e are in di&s;tricts &s;eparate from tho&s;e where the &s;tone-tombs are, rai&s;ed on certain heights and level ground, as numerous and clo&s;e together as in a church-yard. In the&s;e are found plain and com|plete timber-work, large, but decayed. Hence it ap|pears that the bodies in the&s;e graves were laid in a place lined with thick beams, laid upon each other, &s;omething like the hou&s;e of a Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ant; and the whole apparently covered with birch-bark, and other wood, which broke in the cover of the &s;epulchre by its weight. In the&s;e places have been found the bones of two or three bodies; and at the feet &s;everal, little toys, interred with the corp&s;e; earth and cop|per ve&s;&s;els, remnants of wooden ve&s;&s;els and ladles;
<PB N="195" REF="201">
copper tools of all &s;orts, daggers and knives; with traces of &s;cabbards, and other &s;mall in&s;truments. About the head are found buttons, buckles, plated with gold, and other appearances of dre&s;s. Occa|&s;ionally, in the be&s;t-pre&s;erved tombs, have been found vi&s;ible pieces of gold and &s;ilk &s;tuff, and remains of fable-hair. In &s;ome were found bones of large and &s;mall animals; and &s;everal little, angular pyramids of various figures, in ca&s;t-copper, repre&s;enting che&s;s|men, or &s;omething &s;imilar. Remains of lances, and &s;taves of honour are al&s;o met with, where men have been buried; and crutches of ca&s;t copper, &s;ome|times wreathed with &s;tripes of hammered-gold. Nay, &s;ometimes, &s;olid plates of gold have been found, pro|bably the ornaments of the neck or arms; girdles, and the handles of daggers, decorated with gold. In other &s;epulchres, be&s;ides whole bodies, are &s;ome burnt, who&s;e bones lie in a heap together, commonly near the &s;ides of the tomb; and in &s;uch heaps of a&s;hes often lie &s;mall plates of gold, and other little things. In other graves again are &s;een things who&s;e u&s;e or mean|ing cannot be devi&s;ed. An old digger of the&s;e graves, however, a&s;&s;ured me he once found a man's head, made hollow, of fine porcelain-earth, almo&s;t as large as life, painted with green and red leaves; and ano|ther once found a duck, carved in the bark of a&s;pen, and thinly covered with gold. Another made me a pre&s;ent of a wild &s;heep, ca&s;t in copper, &s;tanding on a round pede&s;tal, the produce of &s;uch a grave. They have al&s;o found many buttons, formed like bells, on
<PB N="196" REF="202">
which the figure of a chamois was engraved, as I have mentioned once before. Every thing in copper was ca&s;t. Some traces of iron have been found. One of the&s;e men &s;aid, he once met with a ru&s;ty piece of an axe in iron, but &s;uch metal is very rare.</P>
<P>They are of opinion that mo&s;t of the&s;e tombs have been opened and plundered long &s;ince, as the bones are often &s;een lying in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, and in the&s;e graves nothing of any value is found. In large tombs are &s;keletons of hor&s;es, with remnants of &s;ad|dles, and other hor&s;e-furniture, without the wooden ca&s;e, but beneath the earth. The human bones found are generally of the common &s;ize; yet they a&s;&s;ured me they have found gigantic ones.</P>
<P>In the di&s;trict about the Schu&s;ch, and other places, e&s;pecially ea&s;t of the Jeni&s;ei, are graves, containing a great quantity of confu&s;ed bones, rare lances, and the copper points of arrows; evident proofs of battles.</P>
<P>Four miles up the Schuner, on the Jeni&s;ei, lies Sa|jan&s;koi O&s;trog. It is a fortre&s;s, 50 fathoms' &s;quare, the walls timber, with towers in the angles, and two gates, encompa&s;&s;ed with a ditch, and cheveaux-de|frize. Within are five ca&s;erns, a provi&s;ion &s;tore|hou&s;e, a powder magazine, and &s;ix cannon: the gar|ri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of &s;even co&s;&s;acks and a corporal. As the rocky &s;oil of this place will not admit of hu&s;|bandry,

the hou&s;es of the&s;e men are in the adjacent villages, and two men only, at a time, mount guard here, to take care of the powder and cannon; &s;o that the place looks empty, though the buildings are in a good &s;tate.</P>
<P>I made an attempt to go further up the Jeni&s;ei, by leaving my light-waggon, and going on hor&s;eback, but could get no farther than about &s;even miles, to the fortre&s;s Omai-Tura, which lies in a very rocky cor|ner, clo&s;e to the river, under the mountains that join the Jeni&s;ei, and &s;top all further pa&s;&s;age by land. This place is called by the Tartars <HI>Logina O&s;ida</HI> (the &s;iege of Login); but why, no one can tell. Before the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ettlement, a Kirgue&s;e Horde is &s;aid to have taken refuge here in winter, to be free from their per&s;ecutors, till they went on further, in &s;pring, in the mountains of Mongalia. When the trying-pits on the Oi were worked, here was a pa&s;&s;age on the river for the workmen, the mouth of the Oi being ju&s;t oppo|&s;ite this &s;pot.</P>
<P>In my way, I &s;aw an innumerable quantity of par|tridges and quails; the adjacent mountains are croud|ed with them. The&s;e birds &s;pent the winter here, underneath the &s;now. The cau&s;e that prevents their wandering to warmer, &s;outhern climes is, the high mountains, which are much &s;ooner covered with &s;now; and which, as the autumn drives them here from
<PB N="198" REF="204">
the low-lands, blocks up their pa&s;&s;age &s;outhwards into Europe.</P>
<P>On the night of the 13th, ro&s;e a violent &s;torm from &s;outh-we&s;t, which continued next day, and then changed to north-we&s;t, and cau&s;ed a great fro&s;t. However, I continued my journey, early in the morning, down the Jeni&s;ei, towards Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja; and at the di&s;tance of 23 miles from where I &s;et out, my two waggons were pa&s;&s;ed over the Oi, which is here 60 fathoms wide, but not without danger, as the &s;torm continued. The village U&s;|toi&s;kaja, on both &s;ides, lies not far from its mouth into the Jeni&s;ei. Be&s;ides the pea&s;ants of the place, Co&s;|&s;acks here re&s;ide, who do the frontier-duty. Hence we are naturally led 58 miles up the Oi to Oi-Kebe&s;ch Karaul, which lies on the very &s;pot where the Oi and Kebe&s;ch unite, and which is the middle, and mo&s;t re|mote frontier-po&s;t. The next po&s;t is 39 miles further up the Oi, and is di&s;tant from Abakan&s;kaja 145 miles. The po&s;t next following is 21 miles; but the di&s;tance from that to the fir&s;t frontier-guard of Win&s;koi, on account of the wildne&s;s of the mountains, is not known. The frontier-marks are vi&s;ited by three guard-&s;tations, each of which has garri&s;ons, and are di&s;tant from Oi-Kebe&s;ch-Karaul 83 miles. From the guard-po&s;t, la&s;t-mentioned, the line runs up the Ke|be&s;ch, over a high mountain, to the brook Taradanu; and then down the brook, along the mountain-track U&s;imarga, to the river Us, from who&s;e borders the
<PB N="199" REF="205">
&s;now-mountain Choin-Taban ri&s;es &s;leeply to the &s;kies: hence the boundary runs ea&s;t, over the Us; &s;o that the loftie&s;t mountains about its &s;ource, which run along the north-ea&s;t arm of the Jeni&s;ei, giving the Selenga its &s;ources, belong to Mongalia. This moun|tainous di&s;trict is &s;o wild and dangerous, that it cannot be ridden over in the be&s;t of &s;ea&s;ons. We were obliged to travel on foot, driving our hor&s;es before us, not to run the ri&s;k of falling every moment down the rocks.</P>
<P>Being a&s;&s;ured that on the high rocks, about the Us, were many of the&s;e large Chamoi&s;es, called by the Tartars of this place <HI>Toghe,</HI> and by the Mongols <HI>Takja,</HI> which are not now found farther within Sibe|ria; I had obtained orders for the Tartars of Udin|&s;koi to endeavour to catch me one in the month of January, 1773; but I was lucky enough to receive two frozen ones from Udin&s;koi before I left Siberia. They had been killed between the Uda and Birju&s;&s;a by &s;ome Karaga&s;&s;ians. The one was very old, and had lo&s;t his left horn, probably by a fall; and the other was a young, but full-grown animal. The Mountain-Tartars call the buck <HI>Toghe,</HI> the &s;he-goat <HI>Hima,</HI> and the young ones <HI>Bit&s;chinja.</HI> The &s;ize of the Siberian Chamois is the &s;ame in proportion to the Helvetian one, as the Siberian &s;tone-ram, or Argali, is to the Mu&s;lon of Cor&s;ica. His colour may be com|pared with the Cabrit of Guinea, and &s;ome deer-like Kirgui&s;ian &s;he-goats. The young buck was more
<PB N="200" REF="206">
light-coloured, and le&s;s black than the old one. The general colour is a light-brown grey. On the body the hair is not much longer than that of the &s;tag, but more like goat's-hair. The fore-part of the belly is long-haired, and &s;o is the neck, hind-part of the head and forehead. The longe&s;t hair, which is rather above four inches, is on the brea&s;t. It has a &s;hort, deer's-tail, black above, and white on the &s;ides. A &s;tripe along the brea&s;t, &s;houlders, thighs, and fore-feet, and a &s;pot between the eyes. The beard, which was about &s;ix inches long in the old Chamois, was all black; but the young one had only &s;ome black &s;pots on the feet, the joints of the fore-legs; and the beard, the brea&s;t, belly, and feet were otherwi&s;e white. The horns were bent, in form of a &s;cythe, very &s;trongly pre&s;&s;ed together &s;ideways; &s;horter about the upper edge, and &s;trongly knotted; or el&s;e flat, wrinkled, and &s;triped. The left-horn of the old one was four inches long, and had 13 knots. The feet of this ani|mal are uncommonly &s;trong and &s;olid, and the &s;houl|ders much more fle&s;hy than the thighs, owing to the animal's leaping on it's fore-feet, when it jumps from rock to rock. Betwixt the hair the Chamois has a rich, grey fleece all over the back and neck, exactly like that of the tame-goat.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the old &s;melting-&s;urnaces and bing-places met with here, and about the Tuba, but now de&s;erted, under the pretence of ore being &s;carce,
<PB N="201" REF="207">
Mr. Gmelin having mentioned and de&s;cribed them in his tour. All I &s;hall ob&s;erve is, that there was found near the&s;e bing-places an old, iron plough-&s;hare, of a peculiar form.</P>
<P>My road led me over the mountain Kuna, where the way down on the north &s;ide is &s;teep. On the back of this mountain are two tombs, or heaps of &s;tones, one near the other, to which every Tartar, who pa&s;&s;es this way, adds one, or throws a bu&s;h. The&s;e tombs are &s;aid to have been made when the Kirgue&s;e inha|bited this di&s;trict. The common &s;tory, among the Tartars, is that a rich Kirgue&s;e Bey had two fine wives, &s;o jealous, that he was obliged to have two jurts for them, one on each &s;ide of the mountain, and that he lived on each &s;ide him&s;elf by turns; but it unfortu|nately happened that the&s;e two met together, when changing of pa&s;tures, fought, and killed each other, and are buried under the&s;e heaps of &s;tones.</P>
<P>Near this place are &s;ome Tartarian jurts, where I remained all night, but could not &s;leep, owing to a Ku&s;nez of the Aimak of Tubin&s;koi, remarkable for having a large &s;pot on his head, overgrown with white hair, which grew &s;o, after a &s;ore he had in his head was healed. The&s;e white &s;pots are always the effect of &s;ores. Some Jakutian and T&s;chulym Tartars are born &s;o. This man was perfect ma&s;ter of the lute, and a real Troubadour in telling and &s;inging tales, which,
<PB N="202" REF="208">
according to their interpretation, were &s;imilar to tho&s;e of Ario&s;to. He &s;ung each &s;tanza fir&s;t to the lute, and then repeated it in a droll, declaiming tone. The harmony of the voices of the Kat&s;chinzy Tartars is much like that of the Kalmucks, and delightful in the open air. Their young people &s;pend whole eve|nings in &s;inging to the lute, not &s;ongs, but &s;ome &s;trange, in&s;ignificant notes; for example, <HI>Oido-ido, ti|dum-dido,</HI> and with great enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P><HI>Kat&s;chinzian Tartars.</HI>&mdash;I &s;hall here add &s;ome ob|&s;ervations on the&s;e Tartars, to complete what has been &s;aid of them in the preceding year. The remark I made of their beardle&s;s, Mongol faces, was now more confirmed; and herein is this horde di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other Siberian Tartars. Being very rich in cattle, they neither profe&s;s agriculture nor chri&s;tianity. Yet they &s;ow a little Siberian buck-wheat and barley, to make groats. Like the Mongols, they are &s;atisfied with one wi&s;e; often court for three, four, or five years; on which account parents &s;uffer their children to be courted early: but &s;ome have already aboli&s;hed the Kalym, or marriage-price; and tho&s;e who do receive any thing for their daughters, get it by in&s;tal|ments. The &s;uitor is never &s;uffered to be alone with the bride, before the nuptials have been celebrated; as it would be highly di&s;graceful to the lady to have any prior intimacy with her intended hu&s;band. This, however, is quite contrary to the cu&s;tom of the Mon|gols
<PB N="203" REF="209">
and Kalmucks. The fir&s;t nuptial-fea&s;t is given by the bride's father; the next by the bridegroom; and for their &s;econd fea&s;t the bridegroom's father erects a jurt for the young couple; but the hou&s;e|hold-furniture, and garments of the bride are pro|vided by her father. After the fir&s;t court&s;hip, the father-in-law never &s;ees his &s;on's wife again, nor does he enter his &s;on's jurt; and &s;hould the father-in-law meet her by chance, cu&s;tom enjoins her to throw her&s;elf pro&s;trate on her face, till her father-in-law pa&s;&s;es, which he does with the utmo&s;t preci|pitation. The mother-in-law and the bride's father may have free acce&s;s to the young couple's tent when they plea&s;e. The bride is often richly pre&s;ented with cattle on her marriage, by her parents; and &s;hould her hu&s;band grow tired of her, and &s;end her home, after an interval of &s;ome years, he only returns the num|ber of cattle &s;he brought with her. All the children, and the increa&s;e of her flocks and herds, are his own. This blameable cu&s;tom induces many to court rich girls, merely to enjoy the produce of her fortune; and, after &s;everal years cohabitation, the unhappy fe|male is repudiated. Should &s;he wi&s;h for a divorce on her own account, without having had a &s;on, &s;he has no return; and her parents are liable to refund the hu&s;band's kalym. Both parties are at liberty to marry again after &s;uch a divorce. Daughters are made equal in patrimony to their brothers; and, where there is no brother, the father can give, verbally, his whole property to his daughter. Women do not cohabit
<PB N="204" REF="210">
with their hu&s;bands after delivery for one whole month; and during the continuance of their impurity, which is at lea&s;t 10 days, &s;he is not &s;uffered to do any dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s. At the time of her delivery many women of the neighbourhood a&s;&s;emble at her jurt, but her father does not leave it. The child receives either the name of the fir&s;t &s;tranger that comes into the jurt after its birth, or the father gives it one him&s;elf; and hence many pagan Tartars have Ru&s;&s;ian names.</P>
<P>The chief fe&s;tival celebrated both by the Kat&s;chinzi Tartars, and other heathens of that nation, is the fea&s;t of &s;pring <HI>(Tun)</HI> when they begin to milk their mares. This fea&s;t is not celebrated by all at one time, but by degrees, one family after another, through the whole neighbourhood. It con&s;i&s;ts in tippling, and the ho&s;t pre&s;erves his milk for three days, to di&s;till a &s;ufficient quantity of brandy or &s;pirit. After the fir&s;t fea&s;t, &s;everal neighbouring tribes meet together, go up on a hill, and there perform a &s;olenm &s;acrifice, with prayers <HI>(Chudeiga Ba&s;heraga)</HI> directed towards the ea&s;t. At other times, as in ca&s;es of &s;ickne&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity, they offer to their <HI>Tus,</HI> or hou&s;e-god, called al&s;o <HI>Aima,</HI> little animals, &s;kins, fle&s;h, &amp;c. At their pub|lic &s;acrifices a Kham, or &s;orcerer, mu&s;t be pre&s;ent, who con&s;ecrates a hor&s;e, which they call <HI>Y&s;ik,</HI> and which, according to the injunctions of the Schamans, mu&s;t be either a grey, fox-coloured, or black gelding. Such a con&s;ecration is only performed when a magician thinks proper to ble&s;s the flocks of his countrymen.
<PB N="205" REF="211">
This Y&s;ik, or con&s;ecrated hor&s;e, is wa&s;hed, every &s;pring, during the fea&s;t of the Tun, with milk and boiled wormwood <HI>(Irwen);</HI> and al&s;o incen&s;ed with that herb, decorated with red and white rags about his mane and tail, and then turned loo&s;e. The owner dur&s;t not ride him, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;now has fallen, then he is obliged to &s;addle him; and, when the &s;now di&s;appears, to turn him loo&s;e again. When the animal is too old to ride, the owner may &s;ell him, and get a young one con&s;e|crated as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. If its owner dies, the &s;acred hor&s;e is not &s;laughtered, but becomes the property of his heirs.</P>
<P>The Kat&s;chinzi Tartars are great cooks, and dre&s;s their food in the French fa&s;hion. At pre&s;ent, they have two magicians of their own, but formerly were obliged to borrow tho&s;e of the Tom&s;koi Tartars of Ky&s;il Ai|mak, re&s;iding near the black Yjus. I &s;aw the dre&s;s of a Kat&s;chinzian &s;orcerer, at Kary&s;ch, which had been made many years before he entered the holy profe&s;&s;ion; or, at lea&s;t, before he wi&s;hed to pa&s;s for a &s;orcerer. His dre&s;s, as a beginner, was but moderate; he jobbed about without a cap, with parti-coloured, leather &s;tock|ings, and, on his body, a narrow, dirty, great coat, of printed callico; over his &s;houlders, he wore a red piece of cloth, like a collar, from which 13 ribbands <HI>(Sy&s;im)</HI> hung down, of various colours, green, yellow, red, blue and black, &s;ewed together; and various co|loured &s;ilk and cotton rags, &s;ome worked through with
<PB N="206" REF="212">
mock gold, &s;o as that no one was like the other. In|&s;tead of the magic drum, he held a piece of wood in one hand, round in the middle, flat at both ends, like an oar, and ornamented with a little bell, on which he tinkled very bri&s;kly, &s;triking it alternately on each &s;ide with a wooden beater. Many other &s;orcerers u&s;e the &s;ame magic in&s;trument, &s;aying, they are obliged &s;o to do, till their Spirits will &s;uffer them to beat a drum; but the truth is, they cannot afford to purcha&s;e one, and wait for the &s;laughter of &s;ome, good hor&s;e, who&s;e &s;kin they can get to make one; for &s;uch a &s;acrifice is re|qui&s;ite, to furni&s;h them with a drum.</P>
<P>Of late years, a kind of rage has unhappily &s;eized many girls, at the time their men&s;es fir&s;t makes its ap|pearance, and continues for &s;everal years. It is &s;o vio|lent, that they often run out of their tents, make frightful faces, pluck out their hair, and would either hang, or kill them&s;elves, if they were not prevented. The&s;e fits la&s;t but a few hours; but they have an irre|gular relap&s;e, weekly or monthly. I &s;aw &s;uch girls, between the fits, very rational and well-di&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>The venereal di&s;ea&s;e is al&s;o become common of late years, and breaks out at fir&s;t in boils, on the head, body and groin. The Tartars call it, <HI>Kotur.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;mall-pox <HI>(T&s;chet&s;chiak)</HI> is here only occa&s;ion|ally, &s;ometimes not heard of for many years; but when
<PB N="207" REF="213">
once it prevails, makes great ravage, e&s;pecially among children and young people; when a fear of catching it, a bad attendance therein, the uncleanline&s;s of the diet and abode, and impurity of the blood, &s;eldom fail to carry the patient off. It raged here about 10 years &s;ince.</P>
<P>The Kat&s;chinzy Tartars occupy the fine&s;t di&s;trict of the regency of Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, which is all the land between the White Yjus and the Jeni&s;ei, to the Uybat and Abakan. They are divided into &s;ix aimaks; each has a pre&s;iding ku&s;nez, confirmed by the regency of Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, who collects the tribute, decides little cau&s;es, and maintains good order; but he has no &s;a|lary, and pays his head-money equally with the lowe&s;t of the tribe. They amount to 1155 tributary heads, or families, and pay annually a Ja&s;&s;ak of 2196 rubles. In this di&s;trict are al&s;o &s;ettled four other hordes of Tartars, amounting to 222.</P>
<P>They live, like all &s;ub&s;tantial Tartars on the Jeni&s;ei, in felt-tents, in winter only, which they &s;tow away in &s;ummer in cavities of rocks, known only to them&s;elves, in order to pre&s;erve them dry, to cover their jurts again the next autumn. For this purpo&s;e, they collect birch-bark, about the end of June, a &s;ea&s;on when it is in the be&s;t &s;tate to keep out wet. By boiling, they clear it of all gummine&s;s, pre&s;erving only the re&s;inous parts, which renders it &s;mooth, and not liable to rot.
<PB N="208" REF="214">
Hence the month of June is called <HI>Toos-ai</HI> (birch-month).</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, among the&s;e Tartars and Beltirs, a par|ticular manner of making milk-brandy, different from that of the Tungu&s;e, and the Mongol Kalmucks; yet more like the Tungu&s;e brandy, or &s;pirit, and better than both. The &s;till which they u&s;e is different; and they put a &s;heep's head into the milk, which, after di&s;tillation, is boiled, with &s;mall, minced meat, as a &s;oup, and which they greedily devour as a great dainty. They al&s;o pour milk into the curds, which they will &s;ometimes eat fre&s;h, and &s;ometimes dry, in pieces, called <HI>Bi&s;chro;</HI> and take it with them as a provi&s;ion, when they go a hunting.</P>
<P>On the 16th I cro&s;&s;ed the brook Kok&s;a, and rode down the Jeni&s;ei, along the limits above-mentioned, to the place where we cro&s;s for the Abakan. Here I copied &s;ome of the in&s;criptions already &s;poken of, that were mo&s;t pre&s;erved. Three of them I laid before Major <HI>Wola&s;&s;of,</HI> a gentleman of great erudition, and ver&s;ed in antiquities, who was commi&s;&s;ioned on frontier-bu&s;ine&s;s at Selengin&s;kaja; but the interpreters of this place could not make them out, not being written in Mongol, or Man&s;hurian language; but with an ancient, current character, u&s;ed by &s;ome Chine&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="215">I had now 38 miles to Kary&s;hkoi-Rudnik, where Mr. <HI>Surjef</HI> waited for me, having acquitted him&s;elf of the charge I had entru&s;ted him with, that of in&s;pecting &s;ome bitter &s;alt-lakes on the Abakan.</P>
<P>The autumnal &s;ea&s;on, which every day grew more cold and bad, determined me to go back to Kra&s;no|jar&s;kaja, where I had enough to employ me. I returned, therefore, on the 18th, and arrived there on the 23d, by the &s;ame road I pa&s;&s;ed la&s;t year. In order to return from Siberia, I was obliged to wait for the &s;ledge-&s;ea|&s;on, and the arrival of Mr. <HI>Georgi,</HI> and &s;ome gentlemen &s;tudents I had left behind me in Dauria.</P>
<P>At Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of the Jeni|&s;ei, they often find elephant bones; and I took up, my|&s;elf, a grinder of this animal, from under a high &s;and-bank, a mile or two from the town; but could find no mark, or traces of marine bodies, &s;outh of this place, to the Sajanian mountains.</P>
<P><Q>Profe&s;&s;or Pallas has frequently &s;poken of &s;ome great change in the earth, evident from the number of &s;uch bones found, and the marine &s;ub&s;tances, &s;o frequently met with in the low lands of Siberia. It will be rather interrupting his narrative, but I per|&s;uade my&s;elf it mu&s;t be gratifying to every philo|&s;ophic reader, to know his opinion on this &s;ubject. Buffon, and others, have thought that mountains owe
<PB N="210" REF="216">
their origin to convul&s;ive motions of the earth, being thrown up by &s;ubterraneous fires. Pallas was of the &s;ame way of thinking, till he traver&s;ed the exten&s;ive wilds of Siberia and Tartary. But, on a minute ex|amination of the contents of the&s;e mountains, and tho&s;e of the plains below them, he is now convinced that the hypothe&s;is is an erroneous one. The&s;e moun|tains are a continued chain of &s;olid, granite rock, extending over a va&s;t continent, from &s;ea to &s;ea; not found in layers, but in blocks and lumps, or at lea&s;t in ma&s;&s;es, heaped one upon another; not di&s;|covering the &s;malle&s;t trace of petrifactions, or organic impre&s;&s;ion; of cour&s;e, it appears to have been formed prior to all organized nature. The highe&s;t eminences the&s;e rocky mountains form, whether in ridges, or &s;harp pikes, do not &s;eem to have been co|vered again by clayey, or calcareous layers, originally from the &s;ea, but to have been there from the earlie&s;t periods of time, or ever &s;ince they obtained their elevated and landed &s;ituation, above the level of the &s;eas; of cour&s;e, we are to &s;uppo&s;e, that this granite &s;ub&s;tance, which forms the&s;e mountains, and is al&s;o the core of the va&s;te&s;t Alps of the known world, is the principal materials, or &s;ub&s;tance, of the interior of our globe.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Leaving the&s;e chains of mountains, we perceive the calcareous beds rapidly tending to the plain, tak|ing a horizontal po&s;ition, and becoming abundant in
<PB N="211" REF="217">
all manner of &s;hells, madrepora, and other &s;poils of the ocean. The &s;ame are met in the lowe&s;t vallies at the foot of the mountains; the whole extent like|wi&s;e of Great Ru&s;&s;ia is filled with them, appearing no le&s;s on the hills, than in the flat countries; &s;ome|times &s;olid, as if &s;own with marine productions; at others, altogether compo&s;ed of &s;hells, and broken madrepora, and that calcareous gravel always found in tho&s;e latitudes where the &s;ea abounds with &s;uch productions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As &s;oon as, from the mar&s;hes of Ingria, which form, towards the Baltic, a &s;ort of gulph, in low lands, we begin to a&s;cend the elevated &s;oil of Ru&s;&s;ia, who&s;e declivity makes what is commonly called the moun|tains of Valdais, and continually meet with ancient traces of the &s;ea, over a country which has vi&s;ibly &s;uffered from an inundation of the greate&s;t violence; the&s;e are terrene layers of a depo&s;itum, &s;trewn with blocks of granite, broke from their original rocks, va&s;t banks of rolled flints and gravel, mixed with petrifactions, and even the bones of animals. A &s;imilar inundation may be traced, as far as the lake Onega, where the mountains, from the Lapland and Swe|di&s;h Alps, begin to ri&s;e. It is &s;ufficient to ca&s;t the eye over the map, to &s;ee, in the great number of lakes, between the gulph of Finland and the White-Sea, in the i&s;les, the rocks and the broken &s;hores of the&s;e latitudes, the effect of a deluge, which has run
<PB N="212" REF="218">
that way; of cour&s;e, it may be concluded, that the Baltic and White-Seas, tho&s;e great breaches of the continent, have been excavated by the &s;ame violence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hence it follows, that all tho&s;e va&s;t plains of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire, were formerly the bottom of the ocean; and that the elevated grounds, and high chains of mountains, have always been i&s;lands and continents, much le&s;s exten&s;ive than at pre&s;ent; and that owing, probably, to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive effects of volcanoes, other &s;ubterranean powers, and a deluge, the &s;eas may have left it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the &s;andy, and other &s;limy depo&s;itums, are found trunks of trees entire, and fragments of wood petrified, and often mineralized, by copper, or iron. Petrified wood is often found in the &s;and-hills on the plains, nay, in the &s;andy heights of the Sy&s;ran on the Wolga, changed into very fine hone, which has pre|&s;erved the original texture of the wood, and is re|markable for the ve&s;tiges of tho&s;e gnawing worms that attack the bottom of &s;hips, and other timbers laid in water, and who&s;e proper origin is from the Indian &s;ea. Here are al&s;o interred the remains of the larger animals of the Indies: the bones of ele|phants, of rhinocero&s;&s;es, and of mon&s;trous buffaloes, are frequently dug up in numbers, and are the ad|miration of the curious. The&s;e great bones, laid in
<PB N="213" REF="219">
beds, mixed with little calcined <HI>tellinae,</HI> bones of fi&s;hes, &amp;c. prove &s;ufficiently that they have been tran&s;ported by inundations; and was what convinced Dr. Pallas of the reality of a deluge, that had hap|pened on our earth. But the carca&s;e of a rhi|noceros, which Pallas has depo&s;ited in the cabinet of the Academy of Sciences at Peter&s;burg, and which was found with the &s;kin entire, the remains of the tendons, ligaments and cartilages, in the frozen lands, near the banks of the Uli, is another convincing proof, that it mu&s;t have been a mo&s;t violent and ra|pid inundation, which could formerly have carried &s;uch carca&s;es towards the&s;e frozen climes, and, be|fore putrefaction had time enough to de&s;troy their &s;ofter parts.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It mu&s;t then have been that deluge of which almo&s;t all the antient people of A&s;ia, the Chaldeans, the Per&s;ians, the Indians, the Thibetans, and the Chi|ne&s;e, have pre&s;erved the tradition; and fix it within a few years of the general deluge of Mo&s;es; to which &s;ub&s;equent inundations may have added their influence.</Q></P>
<P>The greate&s;t curio&s;ity in mineralogy, di&s;covered in the di&s;trict of Kra&s;nojar&s;k, is an enermous ma&s;s of pure iron, weighing 40 puds, or near 1500lb. on which I &s;hall expatiate a little. This mo&s;t curious ma&s;s was di&s;covered in 1750, on a mountain where they made a
<PB N="214" REF="220">
trying-pit for iron-ore, and where it lay on the &s;urface, but not then thought worthy of notice. Among the miners who made the di&s;covery, was a Mr. John Mettich, who gave me the following account of the &s;ituation of this iron-ma&s;s, in writing. "In 1749, a reformed Co&s;&s;ack, an inhabitant of Ubei&s;kaja, an|nounced a hard iron ore at the top of a high mountain (de&s;cribing that where the ma&s;s &s;tood). This iron-ore &s;tood lode-like, on a little rock-&s;helf, turned to the north. I was &s;ent to examine it, and found it on an a&s;&s;ay, to have gold alloy. The lode &s;tood in a hard, chertz-like, grey matrix, of which the whole mountain &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t. About 150 fathoms &s;outh-we&s;t from this &s;pot, I ob&s;erved, at the top of the mountain, thinly over-grown with red and white firs, a lump of iron, apparently above 30 puds in weight, full of yellow, hard, little &s;tones, of the &s;ize of a cedar-nut, which could not be knocked out. This, and the &s;ound, appeared to me remarkable; yet I cannot &s;ay it grew thus natu|rally, or whether it was brought there, as it was lying, on day, on the &s;urface of the ground. On a &s;trict exa|mination, I found no traces of old mine-works, or &s;melting-hearths, throughout the whole extent of the mountain. I know, that this Co&s;&s;ack afterwards car|ried the lump away; but what is become of it, I can|not tell."</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances were found true, after the mountain had been &s;trictly examined. The iron ore is
<PB N="215" REF="221">
a &s;olid, blue-black, with here and there a magnetic quick&s;tone metal, yielding on a&s;&s;ay, a 70th part of raw iron. The Co&s;&s;ack, who is now a black&s;mith, could not tell the exact &s;ituation, or place, where this iron lump lay; but what he &s;aid, was probably agreeable to what Mr. Mettich wrote down. He averred, that it lay quite on the &s;urface, on the top of the mountain, without being encompa&s;&s;ed with any other cliff or &s;trata. He al&s;o a&s;&s;ured me, that he never found any mark of an old &s;melt-hearth, or work, neither on this, nor on the oppo&s;ite mountain. But as the malleability and white|ne&s;s of the iron, and the &s;onorous found of the lump, made him &s;u&s;pect it might contain &s;ome more noble metal than common iron; and his &s;u&s;picions being &s;till increa&s;ed by the Tartars, who con&s;idered it as a &s;acred thing fallen from heaven, he endeavoured, as no works were ordered, after having announced this one, to con|vey it to his dwelling, at 32 miles di&s;tance, which he did with the greate&s;t difficulty.</P>
<P>I received information of this piece of ma&s;&s;ive iron, in November 1771, by a Tartarean &s;oldier, who was very u&s;eful to me in collecting matters relative to na|tural hi&s;tory. This &s;oldier entered by chance the hou&s;e of the above. Co&s;&s;ack who found the iron, and &s;eeing it in his yard, it &s;truck him as a curio&s;ity. Knocking off, with great trouble, a few, little pieces, he brought them to me for an a&s;&s;ay; but as this a&s;&s;ay, though im|perfect, &s;eemed very ferruginous, I ordered the &s;oldier
<PB N="216" REF="222">
to go, without delay, to the village where this man lived, which was 170 miles di&s;tant from Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, and bring me the whole ma&s;s, which weighed above 42 puds.</P>
<P>The whole &s;eems to have been encompa&s;&s;ed by a raw, ferruginous cru&s;t, which was lo&s;t by hammering it, to knock off &s;ome pieces. The whole, internal part con|&s;i&s;ts of a &s;lender, white iron, inter&s;per&s;ed with little holes, or cells, like a &s;ea-&s;ponge; and the inter&s;tices filled with round and oblong drops, of a yellow, tran&s;|parent and pure gla&s;s, or hyacinthus-flux. The&s;e drops have various, oblong, round &s;hapes, and a very &s;mooth &s;urface, with one, two, three, or more flat &s;ides, about the truncated part of their rounded bodies, which flow often together, with other drops. This texture and drops are from the &s;ize of a grain of hemp-&s;eed, to a large pea, and either of a pure yellow, or a yellow-brown, or greeni&s;h colour; and are uniform throughout the ma&s;s, without any appearance of &s;melting, or ar|tificial fire. The iron is &s;o tough, that three or four &s;miths were working a whole forenoon, to knock off a piece from one of its corners; though &s;uch piece weighed &s;eldom more than a pound or two, except one piece that weighed a pud, and was &s;ent, for a&s;&s;ay, to the Academy of Sciences at Peter&s;burgh. By the blows, the flux is reduced into a kind of gla&s;s-du&s;t, and often falls out in whole drops, with which gla&s;s might be cut. In &s;hort, the whole ma&s;s, and each piece cut out from
<PB N="217" REF="223">
it, proves inconte&s;tibly that this huge production came out of Nature's lap. But he who&s;e eyes cannot be con|vinced by the &s;ight of it, will find the following remarks not quite u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>It appears, that the ancient miners, who&s;e bing-places and &s;melting-hearths are to be met with in the me|tallic di&s;tricts about the Jeni&s;ei, never worked any iron, nor had any knowledge of it; as all tools, even their military weapons and knives, were made of ca&s;t copper; but wherever the&s;e trying-pits are &s;een on ferruginous ochres, they had gold alloy in view. Their bing-places con&s;i&s;t of raw &s;tone, and melt-copper peb|bles; and wherever any iron bing-places are found, it is known, that their proceedings were &s;o poor and imperfect, probably on account of their un&s;ettled and vagabond way of living, that they would never have been able to melt a lump of four puds, much le&s;s one of 40 puds, which would require a very, high bla&s;t; and &s;hould this be con&s;idered as po&s;&s;ible, again&s;t all probability, yet there could be no cau&s;e why &s;uch a huge ma&s;s, unfit for &s;mith's work, on account of the &s;lux with which it is mixed, &s;hould have been conveyed from the place where it had been &s;melted, to the lofty and &s;teep top of a mountain, de&s;titute in it&s;elf, and its vicinage, of all marks of works, or &s;melting.</P>
<P>That &s;uch a large ma&s;s of iron mu&s;t have been melted by a very, high bla&s;t, has been the opinion of <HI>Mon&s;. de
<PB N="218" REF="224">
Engel&s;trom,</HI> in a di&s;cour&s;e he held, on the 4th of May, 1774, in the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stock|holm, occa&s;ioned by the de&s;cription here given of this ma&s;s of pure iron, publi&s;hed in the Peter&s;burgh, and other foreign gazettes. Before I had &s;een the whole ma&s;s, I was almo&s;t of the &s;ame opinion; but afterwards was very particular in enquiring and examining, whether there were any traces of &s;melting-hearths on the moun|tain where the lump was found, or its environs; though its huge &s;ize alone, &s;hewed the inconte&s;tible impo&s;&s;i|bility of its being &s;o produced; which I found con|firmed by my &s;earch. <HI>Mon&s;. de Engel&s;trom</HI> &s;ays, <Q>The tran&s;parent flux intimates a previous &s;melting.</Q> He mu&s;t certainly mean, a &s;melting in the bo&s;om of Na|ture, or his rea&s;oning de&s;erves no a&s;&s;ent of mine; though I never &s;aw any mark of ancient volcanoes in the Siberian mountains. I would not have him, how|ever, pin his faith on my credit; but on the credit of the whole Academy of Sciences at Peter&s;burgh, and many others, who have &s;een bunches of this ma&s;&s;ive iron, not containing the lea&s;t appearance of coals melt|ed in, nor the lea&s;t mark of fire, produced by human hands; and the whole ma&s;s, which weighs &s;till more than 39 puds, and has been brought to Peter&s;burgh, will be an eternal proof of it, in the Imperial cabinet of natural hi&s;tory. The want of natural iron, in the mo&s;t metallic mountains of Sweden, is &s;o little a proof again&s;t the exi&s;tence of it el&s;ewhere, as again&s;t the truth of there being red-lead &s;par in Siberia, becau&s;e there has
<PB N="219" REF="225">
not been any found in foreign mines; or of the tin ores in Ru&s;&s;ia, becau&s;e they have not yet been di&s;covered in the Uralian and Siberian mountains.</P>
<P>The true account above given, and the following ar|guments, mu&s;t in&s;ure the belief of every one; becau&s;e, if all other circum&s;tances were unfavourable, and con|trary to fact, the following rea&s;ons mu&s;t prove, that the lump of iron in que&s;tion is natural, and no pro|duction of artificial fire. Iron melted in fire, looks blacki&s;h, dry, and not tran&s;parent; but the flux, in the ma&s;&s;ive iron we have been &s;peaking of, is pure, tran&s;|parent, looks fatti&s;h, and falls to pieces, if the bunch is put into the fire. Had the grains been mixed with iron in artificial fire, the whole ma&s;s would not have &s;o clo&s;ely been filled up, but the iron mu&s;t have been im|pure, and full of holes. There is no artificial fire that can give iron &s;o regular a form, re&s;embling a &s;ponge; it would have been in grains, and rough pieces, blown together, like impure bings, when taken out of the bla&s;t. All the&s;e circum&s;tances put it beyond the &s;ha|dow of a doubt, even to tho&s;e who have not &s;een the lump; and tho&s;e who have, mu&s;t be convinced by ocu|lar demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>Winter began very &s;oon in the pre&s;ent year, and &s;pread, in December, its uncommon, chilling bla&s;ts throughout the country. On the 6th and 7th of De|cember was the &s;evere&s;t cold I ever yet felt in Siberia;
<PB N="220" REF="226">
the air was &s;till, and, as it were, thickened by it; and, in the &s;erene &s;ky, the &s;un looked as if enveloped in a fog. The 6th, in the morning, I looked at my hair-tube thermometer, acknowledged to be an excellent one, and it pointed but at 235 degrees; the mercury had retreated into the little globe which this in&s;trument has, and &s;ome little columns &s;tuck in the tube, and &s;tood fa&s;t; a circum&s;tance I never ob&s;erved in my thermometer, for the eight years I had u&s;ed it. The warmth of a moderately heated room, to which I car|ried it from the gallery of the hou&s;e, occa&s;ioned the &s;topped column of quick&s;ilver to drop in&s;tantly, and the quick&s;ilver in the little globe ro&s;e, after the &s;pace of half a minute. I repeated this experiment different times, and always with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s; &s;o that &s;ome|times but one, and &s;ometimes more than one, little piece of mercury, &s;tuck in the tube. When the globe was warmed by the fingers, the quick&s;ilver ro&s;e, and we &s;aw plainly that the frozen, &s;ticking columns made a long re&s;i&s;tance, and were finally drawn up by a kind of &s;udden impul&s;e. During this, I put into an open ba|&s;on, about a quarter of a pound of mercury, which had been thoroughly cleaned by vinegar and leather, and al&s;o well dried, and &s;et it in the cold, in the gallery on the north &s;ide of my lodging; and, in le&s;s than an hour, I found its borders and &s;urface fa&s;t frozen; and, in a few minutes more, the whole was conden&s;ed, by natural cold, into a &s;oft and little ma&s;s, whil&s;t the part beneath the &s;urface was not frozen. The frozen part exhibited
<PB N="221" REF="227">
all &s;orts of branch-like wrinkles; but the mo&s;t part re|mained &s;mooth. The frozen part of the mercury was more flexible than lead; but bent &s;hort, it was more fragile than tin, and, in thin plates, was &s;omewhat gra|nulous. When &s;truck with a hammer, if the hammer was &s;ufficiently chilled, the quick&s;ilver fell into drops at every blow; &s;o it did with the finger, who&s;e end, when touching the mercury, felt, as if benumbed. In a temperate room, it thawed, like wax, over the fire, drop by drop, from the &s;urface, not melting at once. If the frozen ma&s;s was broken in the cold, the broken pieces &s;tuck to each other, and to the ba&s;on wherein they lay. Though the fro&s;t &s;eemed to abate a little be|fore night, yet the frozen mercury lay unchanged; and the &s;ame experiment, with the thermometer, could be always repeated. On the 7th of September, I had an opportunity to make the &s;ame ob&s;ervations, during the whole day; but, a few hours after &s;un-&s;et, aro&s;e a north-we&s;t, wind, which rai&s;ed the thermometer to 215 degrees, and here the ma&s;s of quick&s;ilver began to di&s;&s;olve.</P>
<P>Shortly after, Lieutenant-general <HI>De Brill,</HI> governor of Irkuzkaja, a&s;&s;ured me, he found there, on the 9th of December, at four in the morning, that all the mercury in a thermometer and barometer, made by the mo&s;t &s;kilful hand of Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Laxmann,</HI> during his re|&s;idence in Siberia, was hard frozen. In the barometer, it &s;tood at 28 inches &s;even lines, and was in &s;mall pieces
<PB N="222" REF="228">
of five-lines each, to the top. Towards 11 in the morn|ing, it was fluid again; and, at one o'clock, the baro|meter was 29 inches &s;even lines high; and at nine at night, 29 inches. The thermometer was chilled to 213&deg;, and beneath 226&deg; was an empty &s;pace of nine degrees; about 11 o'clock all had entered the globe, and about 10 o'clock next morning, when it thawed again, it ro&s;e, and pointed 254&deg;; and, at three o'clock, and &s;ome minutes, 194&deg;: all, according to <HI>De Li&s;le.</HI> The air, the whole day, was calm and &s;erene.</P>
<P>From Mr. <HI>Sokolof</HI>'s tour along the Daurian frontiers, which he undertook, in pur&s;uance of my directions, in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t &s;ummer, I mu&s;t not omit men|tioning a hot well, which he vi&s;ited on the 25th of July, famous, among the Tungu&s;e Tartars, for its &s;alubrious qualities. It lies &s;traight north from the frontier-guard, on the banks of the Balyra, at the di&s;tance of two good day's journey, or 112 miles. The water is perfectly clear, but a little blui&s;h, has the &s;mell and ta&s;te of gunpowder, or rotten eggs, and is &s;o hot that one can &s;carce bear the hand in it. On account of the great heat, thick vapours ri&s;e from it in &s;ummer-evenings. Many rich people come here and bathe in it, and are very often radically cured. The Tungu&s;e adore this &s;pring, drink the water with a &s;acred awe, and dare not bathe in it with any part of their cloaths on. There are other hot baths, in this di&s;trict equally &s;alubrious.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="229">Not far from Altan&s;koi-Karaul, is one of the highe&s;t mountains of Dauria, called, by the Ru&s;&s;ians, <HI>T&s;cho|konda,</HI> and, by the Tungu&s;e, <HI>Sochondo.</HI> Mr. <HI>Sokolof</HI> travelled on it from the 3d of July to the 3d of Augu&s;t; it is very &s;teep, wooded with cedars and larch-fore&s;ts, and the underwood con&s;i&s;ts of birch-bu&s;hes. Near the &s;ource of Aguzakan, on this mountain, is a very &s;teep cupola, or tower, where the huge, bearded vultures an|nually build their ne&s;ts; clo&s;e by, is a level ground, encompa&s;&s;ed by the fore&s;t, from whence one may over|look every thing below; and beyond it we view, with awful amazement, the &s;teep, rocky clifts, who&s;e &s;now|clad, blue &s;ummits are veiled by the clouds. It rains here almo&s;t every day, and the air is in continual mo|tion. In the middle, the north-wind cau&s;es &s;now, and white fro&s;ts; the trees, at the &s;ame time, cloathed in their be&s;t green. The &s;now-covered clifts occupy a great &s;pace below, and between which are the &s;ources of brooks that flow down into the rivers beneath. There are al&s;o, two principal clifts, running from &s;outh-we&s;t to north-ea&s;t, with a dreadful, deep valley between them, in which the river Aguza has its origin. The nature of the&s;e two clifts, or &s;ummits, is extraordinary; they con&s;i&s;t of enormous, bare &s;trata of mouldering granite, towering up, one over another, into the &s;kies. Mr. <HI>Sokolof</HI> was the whole day a&s;cending that at &s;outh-we&s;t: it ri&s;es, like the other parts of this mountain, with huge, &s;teep rock-&s;helves, of which he counted &s;ix, re&s;embling broad &s;tairs. Over each &s;helf, the rocks form a flat &s;pace
<PB N="224" REF="230">
of ground, near half a mile broad, on which various &s;prings ri&s;e, and tumble down the cliffs with a fright|ful roar. The utmo&s;t &s;ummit of the clift, which cannot be a&s;cended without danger, is very horizontal and flat. Upon it are two frightful aby&s;&s;es, encompa&s;&s;ed by &s;teep-rock walls; at the bottom of each is a little lake, formed by the &s;now-water from the rocks, gathering and flowing into them through clefts; and thus into the middle of the valley, in which the Aguza &s;prings. The &s;uper&s;titious Tungu&s;e wor&s;hip this mountain, as the &s;hrine of the offended gods; and, for this rea&s;on, they do not attempt to climb it, &s;uppo&s;ing the a&s;cent im|po&s;&s;ible: of cour&s;e, they &s;tood amazed at Mr. <HI>Sokolof</HI>'s journey on it, and his &s;afe return.</P>
<P>As no remarkable part of the &s;outhern di&s;trict of Siberia was now left unexplored, and it would have been u&s;ele&s;s to have travelled over the di&s;trict of the Lena, and the ea&s;tern parts of Siberia, Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Gmelin</HI> and <HI>Steller</HI> having gone before me; and as it was im|practicable to penetrate into Mongalia, or China, I re|&s;olved to return this winter, in &s;ledges, at half the ex|pence I came here; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to go as far as to the Kama.

<PB N="225" REF="231">
for the beginning of January, my plan being to wait at Tura, for the arrival of Mr. <HI>Georgi;</HI> but receiving, from this gentleman, a propo&s;al to wait for him at Kra&s;nojar&s;k, he being detained longer in his tour than he expected, I con&s;ented to it. Mr. <HI>Georgi</HI> having &s;ailed round that immen&s;e lake, called the Baikal, as far as to the mouth of the Selenga, which he reached in au|tumn, he went out here, partly on account of the &s;tormy weather, and partly to &s;ee the Daurian mine, at a good &s;ea&s;on of the year; and &s;ent his ve&s;&s;el back to the mouth of the Angara.

Of cour&s;e, this mu&s;t be very unfavourable to population; but what is &s;till wor&s;e, they have taken many fathers from their wives and children, and &s;ent them, heart-broken,

broken, into the&s;e places of wretchedne&s;s; and tho&s;e who can forget their families, have been con&s;trained to take other wives, in order to &s;olace their hours, in their employment here.

<P>The Tartars on the Barabynian &s;tep, where, on oc|count of the number of lakes, there are va&s;t quantities of water-fowls, &amp;c. are much employed, in catching plovers <HI>(Colymbi);</HI> the &s;ilver-like, glittering, brea&s;t-&s;kins of which, they &s;ell to pa&s;&s;engers, at from three to five copecs a-piece; and, al&s;o, in collecting the beau|tiful, violet-blui&s;h throats of &s;ea-plovers <HI>(Colymbi arctici)</HI> and the glo&s;&s;y, green heads of the wild March-ganders, which, when &s;ewed together, have a beautiful appear|ance, and make very &s;plendid muffs for the ladies.</P>

The number of hou&s;es, in all amounts to 669; and the male inhabitants, are 1715, of which 252 are of Bucharian extraction, and one de|&s;cended from the Siberian Khan Kut&s;chum. The place has five churches, and a cathedral now building with &s;tone. This la&s;t, with a court of waywodes, &s;ome Im|perial &s;tore-hou&s;es, the trea&s;ury of the fur tribute-office, and the gunpowder-magazine, are encompa&s;&s;ed with a wooden wall; otherwi&s;e, there are no partitions, except the ve&s;tiges of &s;ome old pali&s;adoes and ba&s;tions.</P>
<P>Tara has a governor, a &s;mall garri&s;on, and a court of waywodes, &s;ubordinate to Tobol&s;koi; to which al&s;o belongs the towns, Om&s;kaja, T&s;chernoluzkaja, Tat|myzkaja, Tjukalin&s;kaja, Bergamat&s;kaja, Ajef&s;kaja,
<PB N="228" REF="234">
U&s;t-Tarta&s;koi-Pa&s;s, 103 Ru&s;&s;ian, and 138 Tartarian villages. The number of tributary Tartars in this di&s;trict, including a few Co&s;&s;acks, is 5,248; among which there are 2344 Barabynian Tartars, and 574 citizens, of Bucharian origin.</P>
<P>As the di&s;trict of Tara has very exten&s;ive wilderne&s;&s;es, and, in its northern parts, &s;ome dark vallies, it a|bounds with game. The &s;ables here are not even &s;o valuable as tho&s;e of Tom&s;koi; and, of cour&s;e, are very bad. The other animals are bears, wolves, foxes, martens, ermines, &s;quirrels, beavers, otters, lynxes, and hyenas. In the northern woods, they catch rein-deer; and, in the Barabynian &s;tep, elks, deer, and wild boars.</P>
<P>This di&s;trict is al&s;o rich in fi&s;h; and the Irti&s;ch abounds with &s;turgeon, hu&s;os, <HI>nelma, taimeni,</HI> and <HI>lenki;</HI> and the lakes of the Barabynian and I&s;chimian &s;teps are crowded with pike, barbel, and whitings, plentifully caught during the whole winter. Notwith&s;tanding the land lies low, it contains &s;ome remarkable, mineral earths.</P>
<P>Our bu&s;ine&s;s being completed, on the 23d of Fe|bruary, Mr. <HI>Georgi</HI> left me, according to a plan agreed on, and took his road to Tobol&s;koi. He travelled in &s;ledges, as far as the I&s;et; and, in &s;pring, went up the mountainous &s;ide of that river, as far as Catharineburgh;
<PB N="229" REF="235">
then down the T&s;chu&s;&s;owaja to its mouth, in order to take a view of the habitations betwixt the Sylva and Kama; and then along the Ufa and Djama, to the Jaik; and &s;o, by a new road, through the Jaikian &s;tep, to the Wolga. I went the &s;traighte&s;t road, through the I&s;chimian &s;tep, the province of I&s;et&s;kaja, and the north|ern part of the country of the Ba&s;kirians, intending to go, the next &s;pring, from the Kama towards the Jaik, and through the &s;outhernmo&s;t part of the de&s;arts, &s;ituated between that river and the Wolga, in order to collect &s;uch vernal plants as I mi&s;&s;ed the time before.</P>
<P>Having travelled the chief part of this road in 1770 and 1771, and given my readers every thing worth notice, it would be idle to repeat it. After travelling over 1100 miles of ground, we reached Sarapul, on the 11th of March; and having, in this journey, met with the Wotiaks and T&s;cheremi&s;&s;es, I will here give &s;ome account of them.</P>
<P>Among all the little nations, of Finni&s;h origin, for &s;uch are the T&s;cheremi&s;&s;es, Wotiaks, Ea&s;tjaiks and Mordvines, the Wotiaks are the lea&s;t di&s;per&s;ed in the Ru&s;&s;ian empire, and &s;till inhabit their ancient abodes. According to their own account, their princes had for|merly, in the place where A&s;koi Pri&s;gorod now &s;tands, a fortified re&s;idence; but the Tartars obliged them to quit the &s;ame, and take refuge in the thick fore&s;ts,
<PB N="230" REF="236">
towards the Wjatka, and Upper Kama, which has its name from them; <HI>Kam,</HI> in Wotiak, meaning a large river.</P>
<P>The Wotiaks, or Oudmurt, as they call them&s;elves, which &s;ignifies Man, have &s;ome characteri&s;tic marks which di&s;tingui&s;h them from their neighbours, the T&s;cheremi&s;&s;es. They are more lively, more gay, and le&s;s ob&s;tinate; both men and women are addicted to tippling, which mu&s;t be attributed to the liberty they formerly had of di&s;tilling &s;pirits, without any impo&s;t; being very little mixed with Ru&s;&s;ians, or other &s;tran|gers. There are not many tall and well-formed people among them; the women, in particular, are little, and of mean appearance. No nation is &s;o red-haired as this; yet there are &s;ome few with black hair, and &s;ome men have light-coloured hair on their heads, and red|di&s;h beards. They are not &s;o cleanly as the Tartars, yet more &s;o than the Mordvines, and Finlanders; and, in their hou&s;es and cloaths, are &s;imilar to the T&s;chere|mi&s;&s;es. As their ve&s;&s;els and victuals are mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;t|fully na&s;ty, &s;o is their &s;trong liquor di&s;agreeable to the ta&s;te; though, in the di&s;tilleries, they &s;pare neither malt, nor honey.</P>
<P>The head-dre&s;s of their women is the mo&s;t peculiar, and enormous, of all the nations &s;ubject to Ru&s;&s;ia. They bend a piece of birch-bark, about &s;ix inches broad, into the form of half a cylinder, &s;o as to fit the
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="237">
<HEAD>WOTIAKS.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="231" REF="238">
top of the head; it is kept in this form, by a bow of wood in the in&s;ide; and, in the opening behind, a nar|row piece of birch-bark is placed. On the top of this cylinder, they fa&s;ten another piece of birch-bark, bent into a &s;quare, &s;ix inches broad, inclining a little for|wards, like our grenadier's cap; the upper part is co|vered with red, and the lower with blue cloth, which is u&s;ually ornamented with copecs, and little tin plates. What gives the be&s;t appearance to this &s;caffold, is a cloth, an ell long, &s;ewed on the edge with red, blue and brown needle-work, and has, round about it, blue, red and white fringes, three or four inches long. This cloth is fa&s;tened on the upper border of the birch-bark, &s;o that the ends hang down on each &s;ide, having the or|naments vi&s;ible between them; and the re&s;t of the cloth hangs down behind on the back. Underneath this head-dre&s;s, the women wear their hair twi&s;ted, on both &s;ides, over the ears, &s;o as to re&s;emble a thick knot, orna|mented with beads and jingling toys. No married wo|man will appear before a &s;tranger, without &s;uch a bonnet; and &s;hould any one enter a Wotiak hou&s;e, at night, they will even go to bed in this head-dre&s;s; which they wear, al&s;o, in doing the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e. Widows, and very old women, free them&s;elves from this incumbrance, and wind a cloth, like a handkerchief, round the head, letting the ends, which are embroidered with needle-work, hang down behind.</P>
<P>Their cloaths are al&s;o &s;ingular. Their upper-garment is long, made of cloth, or linen-&s;tuff, with long &s;leeves,
<PB N="232" REF="239">
and open, like tho&s;e of the Polanders; through which they put their arm, fa&s;tening the narrow end to their girdle behind. About the neck is a &s;quare fall-down cape, like a collar. They wear &s;hifts, embroidered with needle-work about the neck and wri&s;ts, and breeches quite tight to the limbs.</P>
<P>Girls, like the Tartars, wear round bonnets, orna|mented with beads and coins; with this difference, that they hang an embroidered cloth, floating down behind, with a kind of bead-necklace, hanging loo&s;ely from one ear to the other, acro&s;s the neck before, braiding their hair behind, and concealing it beneath the&s;e cloths. From the girdle hang &s;trings and fringes.</P>
<P>The architecture of the Wotiaks is but little diffe|rent from that of the people of T&s;chuwa. Their hou&s;es are &s;cattered, without pales, or enclo&s;ures; and contain large, &s;leeping benches, and Tartar furniture. They are good hu&s;bandmen, keep bees in hollowed trees, hunt all the winter, and are able &s;hooters.</P>
<P>I can &s;ay but little of their religion, but what has been &s;aid in the Collections of Ru&s;&s;ian hi&s;tory. There are but two heathen villages remaining among them; and though the chri&s;tian Wotiaks, in the regency of Ca&s;an, chiefly profe&s;s pagani&s;m clande&s;tinely, yet they are afraid to be noticed, in &s;o doing, by the Ru&s;&s;ian clergy that re&s;ide among them. I gathered, however,
<PB N="233" REF="240">
the following account of the&s;e pagans, who inhabit the regency of Orenburg. Be&s;ides the great god, called, by them <HI>Inmar,</HI> they wor&s;hip the god of earth and pro|&s;perity, <HI>Mu Kalzin;</HI> the god of water, <HI>Wu-Inmar;</HI> al&s;o, the &s;un, as the throne of the Supreme Deity; and other &s;ubordinate divinities. They call upon the&s;e, in the hour of nece&s;&s;ity, e&s;pecially on their annual fe&s;tivals, and at their &s;olemn &s;acrifices, where an old, &s;acerdotal man, called <HI>Tona,</HI> &s;ays prayers.</P>
<P>Their keremets, or places of &s;acrifice, are in pine|woods, e&s;pecially on a well &s;ituated and elevated &s;pot <HI>(Ku&s;s),</HI> &s;urrounded with white firs, and enclo&s;ed. They celebrate four, general fea&s;ts in the year: the fir&s;t, <HI>But&s;chun-nunal,</HI> is, in the Ru&s;&s;ian ea&s;ter-week, at which time begins their new year, with fea&s;tings; the &s;econd, or <HI>Tulys-nunal,</HI> falls after &s;ummer &s;eed-time, at which they offer prayers, and victims, to the god of the earth. <HI>Wi&s;&s;a&s;ko-nunal,</HI> is a day of &s;upplication for a good harve&s;t, celebrated in one, or more, hou&s;es, of a village; and in which they &s;acrifice &s;parrows <HI>(Kut&s;cho),</HI> caught in &s;nares, and fed for that purpo&s;e. The&s;e they burn in a fire, to obtain good weather, and ea&s;y work. <HI>Keremet-nunal,</HI> is their greate&s;t fe&s;tival; this is cele|brated after harve&s;t, by the whole village, in its kere|met, with &s;olemn &s;acrifices. On this occa&s;ion, they con&s;ume a hor&s;e, of any colour except black, a bul|lock, a &s;heep, a goo&s;e, and a duck. The hor&s;e is the la&s;t &s;laughtered animal; and this, by an a&s;&s;i&s;tant of the
<PB N="234" REF="241">
<HI>Tona;</HI> and all are dre&s;&s;ed for a &s;acrificial meal. The fat and blood are burnt; but the head of the bullock, and &s;heep, with the whole &s;keleton of the hor&s;e, are &s;u&s;pended on a fir-tree, in the keremet. The &s;kins are taken home, and &s;old. The prayers, repeated during the&s;e &s;acrifices, are directed towards the meri|dian &s;un, never towards the ea&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Tooke</HI> tells us, from this Collection of Ru&s;&s;ian hi&s;to|ries, <Q>that the dre&s;s of the Wotiak men, is like that of the Ru&s;&s;ian boors; only that it is commonly made of coar&s;e, white cloth; that their winter-caps are of cloth, with a border of a different colour; that they tie a knife to their girdle, and a ca&s;e, for a hatchet.</Q></P>
<P>He &s;ays, <Q>they are hone&s;t, peaceable, ho&s;pitable, and &s;ober; but &s;uper&s;titious, of cold complexion, and extremely &s;imple. The women have winking eyes, and &s;mile, even to ugline&s;s. They are &s;hort, timid, very mode&s;t, cha&s;te, laborious, and complai&s;ant.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e people &s;peak a language of their own, de|rived from the Finni&s;h language, but have no writ|ings, or letters. In reckoning, they make u&s;e of little &s;ticks, which they call <HI>Pos,</HI> a kind of tally, which they notch. In&s;tead of a &s;ignature, they u&s;e certain marks, called <HI>Hand-marks.</HI> They do not reckon their time by years, but give different names
<PB N="235" REF="242">
to the months, in conformity to natural events. Thus the month of March is named, <HI>Silpron Talis;</HI> i. e. the month of the breaking-up of the ice; the like of the re&s;t. Friday is their &s;abbath, or day of re&s;t. With them, as with other nations of A&s;iatic Ru&s;&s;ia, Wedne&s;day is called the day of blood; on which day they never undertake any thing of importance.</Q></P>
<P>"The Wotiaks, or <HI>Votiaks,</HI>" as <HI>Tooke</HI> calls them, <Q>never compo&s;e large towns; but live in villages, and are always ready to tran&s;port their habitations from one place to another, as appears eligible. The in|terior di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e villages, the hou&s;es, the oeconomy of the people, their food, taxes, and ge|neral con&s;titution, are like the T&s;cheremi&s;&s;es, which will be treated of. To the chief of villages, they give the name of <HI>Ellir;</HI> and to their &s;taro&s;ts, or el|ders, that of <HI>Kartlik.</HI> They are a very retired, re|&s;erved people, and &s;uffer no &s;trangers to come among them; and it is very &s;eldom that any litigation is brought before the tribunal of the province.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They are a&s;&s;iduous in rural oeconomy; and, at their lei&s;ure hours, employ them&s;elves in turning cups, &s;poons, &s;huttles, &amp;c. and varni&s;hing all kinds of bowls and cups. The women employ them&s;elves in &s;ewing, making linen, coar&s;e cloths, and felts, making cloaths, and embroidery. There are not many rich among them, neither are they poor; he
<PB N="236" REF="243">
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es from 15 to 25 de&s;ettines of land (which is a piece of ground 560 feet long and 280 broad), with 30 hor&s;es, and other cattle in proportion, pa&s;&s;es for a rich man, of the fir&s;t cla&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Their manner of &s;alutation is to give hands, and &s;ay, <HI>Die&s;ban;</HI> that is, Health, or Pro&s;perity! The women, in&s;tead of embracing, &s;trike one another with both hands on the &s;houlders. Abu&s;ive terms among them are, <HI>Scho&uuml; ourdam!</HI> Thou walking carca&s;e! <HI>Vi&s;tan &s;cha&iuml;tan!</HI> Thou &s;tupid devil! <HI>Scha&iuml;tan med ba&s;tos!</HI> The devil take thee!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Every village has a number of baths; here the women lye-in. On the birth of a child, the father &s;acrifices a white ram, to the genius, or tutelary angel of the new-born infant; at which time, they fea&s;t, and make merry. The names of men, pecu|liar to this people, are, <HI>I&s;chmak, Danaba&iuml;, Kama&iuml;, Eltemir,</HI> &amp;c. that of women, <HI>Dali&s;ch, Bidelet, Beke, Ak&s;ton, T&s;changa;</HI> which la&s;t &s;ignifies a crow.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Wives are purcha&s;ed: &s;ome pagan Wotiaks buy as many as they can; but they &s;eldom have more than one or two. The marriage-contract is called, <HI>Yera&s;chou;</HI> the price paid <HI>Yerdoun,</HI> and which is ge|nerally from two to fifteen rubles; and the dowry of the bride, is always in proportion to the marriage-price. They never marry their &s;ons under ten years
<PB N="237" REF="244">
of age; nor their daughters, till they are 15; and it is always intere&s;t that determines the choice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On bringing the Yerdoun to the father-in-law, the young man takes back his bride, who is delivered to him veiled. On his return home, he finds gue&s;ts a&s;&s;embled, at his father's hou&s;e, to whom the bride is pre&s;ented, after being previou&s;ly taken a&s;ide into an|other room, and cloathed in the dre&s;s of a married woman, who, whil&s;t the <HI>Torkai,</HI> or prie&s;t, makes the oblation of a cup of beer to the gods, &s;its in the door-way, on a piece of cloth, laid there for that purpo&s;e. The object of the offering, is to procure bread, riches, and children, to the new-married cou|ple; who drink of the beer, ble&s;&s;ed by the prie&s;t, which act may be called, the &s;acerdotal benediction of the nuptials. This done, one of the bride-maids pre&s;ents beer, or mead, to all the gue&s;ts, and the bride kneels down before every one of them, till he has drank off the goblet; they then eat and drink, as much as they can, and dance, till the young peo|ple are put to bed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Some weeks after, the bride's father pays her a vi&s;it, examines into the hou&s;e-keeping, and pays her hu&s;band the remainder of her fortune; or, in lieu of it, gives &s;ome pieces of hou&s;hold-furniture, and takes back his daughter with him, whom he keeps from her hu&s;band two or three months, and &s;ome|times
<PB N="238" REF="245">
even a whole year. During this time of ab|&s;ence, &s;he dre&s;&s;es like a virgin, and is employed at work for her parents and her&s;elf, occa&s;ionally. At the expiration of the determined time, the hu&s;band comes to demand his wife, who &s;hews as much re|pugnance at following him, as &s;he did on the day of her marriage, cries as much at leaving home, and goes to bed to her hu&s;band with the &s;ame reluctance. She &s;oon, however, &s;uffers her&s;elf to be per&s;uaded, and ea&s;ily admits of con&s;olation. The friends of the family are again regaled, and make even greater mer|riment than they did on the wedding-day. A widow's wedding is conducted with much le&s;s ceremony: they dance, to the found of the pipe, called <HI>bys;</HI> of the Ru&s;&s;ian <HI>balaleika,</HI> a kind of guitar, with only two &s;trings; and of another in&s;trument, which they call, <HI>oumkre&s;s.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Before they bury their dead, they wa&s;h the body, and cloath it in complete apparel; and, as they al|ways carry a knife, fa&s;tened to their girdles, &s;o they give one to the decea&s;ed, taking care, however, to break off the point. They lay a cake upon his brea&s;t, and fix a lighted torch by his &s;ide. At the interment, they throw &s;ome copecs into the grave, and pronounce the&s;e words, <HI>Yougt inti &s;ot &s;oui!</HI> O earth, make thou room for him! The body is laid in a kind of coffin, with &s;ome &s;killets and hatchets, la&s;ts for making mat-&s;hoes on, and other
<PB N="239" REF="246">
u&s;eful implements; As &s;oon as they have filled up the grave, they &s;tick &s;ome lighted torches on it, then, throwing three eggs, boiled hard, and cut into &s;mall pieces, on it, they &s;ay, <HI>Tiogafet medou &s;os!</HI> There, keep that for thy&s;elf! On coming from the burial, the friends walk over a fire made before the hou&s;e of the decea&s;ed, rub their hands in a&s;hes, bathe, and change their clothes, and then make merry. The&s;e ceremonies are always the &s;ame, to people of every condition, age or &s;ex.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On the &s;econd day after the interment, they ce|lebrate the fir&s;t, commemorative fe&s;tival called, <HI>Pe|miouka.</HI> At this fea&s;t, in&s;tituted in honour of the dead, his friends a&s;&s;emble in his hou&s;e, and partake of cakes and beer, a portion of which they carry out into the yard, and repeat, as before, <HI>Tiogafet medou &s;os!</HI> The words are addre&s;&s;ed to the decea&s;ed; but the dogs take care of the provi&s;ion. On the &s;eventh day, they &s;acrifice a &s;heep; on the fortieth, a horned bea&s;t, or a hor&s;e. All the victims are eaten, in memory of their departed friend, to whom they &s;end his &s;hare. On the Thur&s;day in Pa&s;&s;ion-week, they celebrate a general, commemorative fe&s;tival; at which they a&s;&s;emble, every one, at the tomb of his relation, light up torches, eat cakes and the fle&s;h of &s;ome victim, leaving a portion on the grave of his family.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="247"><Q>It will readily be conceived, that among&s;t &s;uch a people, there is as much &s;uper&s;tition to be met with, as among European nations. Some of the nations of the Wotiaks think, that Wedne&s;day and Friday are unlucky days; that the flight of a blackbird, or a crow, a-cro&s;s their path; a cuckow perched on the top of a hou&s;e, and the meeting of a hedge-hog in motion; are &s;o many pre&s;ages of death, or at lea&s;t of dangerous &s;ickne&s;s. He who dares to kill a &s;wallow, a lapwing, a pigeon, or a water-wagtail, ex|po&s;es his flock to all &s;orts of misfortunes. They even build ne&s;ts for the &s;wallows. They &s;uppo&s;e that a bear, that has been wounded in the chace, knows his ene|my, and &s;eeks and pur&s;ues him all his life. They take great care not to call a bear by his name, but <HI>Maka,</HI> that is, old man. If a tree is &s;truck by light|ning, it was to de&s;troy a devil which had there taken its abode. Noon is a dangerous time with them, from the fir&s;t appearance of ro&s;es, to the end of Augu&s;t. At every eclip&s;e of the &s;un, or moon, they fancy it a metamorpho&s;e to which the&s;e bodies are &s;ubject. Among the chri&s;tian Wotiaks, they attribute the cau&s;e of bad harve&s;ts to their making no offering to the gods. Whoever would be &s;ure of cro&s;&s;ing the water in &s;afety, mu&s;t fir&s;t throw a handful of gra&s;s into it, and &s;ay, <HI>Ero koul monae,</HI> Do not hold me. They have an a&s;toni&s;hing number of &s;imilar, &s;uper|&s;titious opinions, too tedious to relate. They have al&s;o, among them, <HI>Vedirs,</HI> or magicians, who they
<PB N="241" REF="248">
conceive hold corre&s;pondence with evil &s;pirits, and have even the power of metamorpho&s;ing men into animals. They call him <HI>Oubir,</HI> who has been thus metamorpho&s;ed; and imagine, that, after he has un|dergone this ideal change, he mu&s;t for ever be a va|gabond, and a wanderer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Among the malevolent deities, <HI>Scha&iuml;tan,</HI> or Satan, is the chief. He lives in the water, and is hence called <HI>Vou-mourt,</HI> or watery-man. They have a god, named <HI>Palas-mourt,</HI> or <HI>Alida;</HI> the former &s;ignifies half-man; the latter expre&s;&s;es the idea of a &s;atyr, or daemon of the fore&s;ts. This god dwells in the woods, has but one leg, and one eye, which is very large, and a mon&s;trous nipple to his brea&s;t, with which he &s;tifles men, by thru&s;ting it into their mouths. The <HI>Alba&s;te</HI> of the Wotiaks is much the &s;ame as our <HI>Ignis fatuus,</HI> or jack-a-lanthern; he plays his tricks, holds his wanton revels in de&s;erted hou&s;es, in bathing-rooms, and uninhabited villages; on which account they burn all the hou&s;es and villages they abandon, that they may not become a retreat for the&s;e wicked phantoms.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They imagine a two-fold exi&s;tence after death. The fir&s;t is, <HI>Dounja yougguit,</HI> a re&s;plendent life, the inheritance of the good, wherein they enjoy every kind of happine&s;s a Wotiak is capable of conceiving in this world; the other, <HI>Kouratzin inli,</HI> or the abode
<PB N="242" REF="249">

<P><Q>Whenever any epidemic &s;ickne&s;s rages among them, they &s;acrifice a black &s;heep to Inmar, that he may prevent the devil from doing them harm. The ceremonies of this &s;acrifice are performed on the bank of &s;ome river; and whil&s;t the fle&s;h of the victim is making ready, every father of a family goes with a &s;tick into all the rooms of his hou&s;e, and beating about him, at every &s;troke, cries, <HI>Get out of my hou&s;e!</HI> This done, they fire off a fowling-piece, or &s;hoot an arrow, at a dog, or cat, of the village; which, when killed, they drag with a cord to the place of &s;acrifice, always going down the &s;tream to it; then leaving the animal, with the cord fa&s;tened to it, every one throws his &s;tick into the river, and proceeds to the &s;acrifice, to which they give the name of <HI>Orvas.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>In general, the Wotiaks are very zealous in their religious ob&s;ervances; are very de&s;irous to obtain the approbation of the gods, and u&s;e every means to de&s;erve it: in a word, they are devout, and very pious idolaters; but, notwith&s;tanding this, in 1774, there were reckoned 27,228 males, and 27,169 fe|males, who had been baptized, in the kingdom of Ca&s;an alone.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="250">My account of the T&s;cheremi&s;&s;es, who chiefly inhabit the di&s;tricts about the Wjatka, and the Kama, will be much &s;horter, as I could not meet with an opportunity of being better informed. They are of a middling &s;ize, with light, fair, or red hair, e&s;pecially their beards, which are thin. Their faces are fair, with &s;trong fea|tures. They are weak, &s;lothful, timid, very rogui&s;h and more ob&s;tinate than any people I ever &s;aw. Some of their women have fine faces, but far inferior to the Tartars; and their common dre&s;s is very unfavourable to beauty. Their hair they twi&s;t into two tails, one on the crown of their head, the other on the back part; the re&s;t of the hair is formed into knots; and, after all, the head is covered with a &s;mall cap, embroidered with various coloured needle-work. This is the head-dre&s;s of the married women; and, when they go abroad, they tie a cloth, worked in the &s;ame manner, over the head, and under the chin. Girls, who generally go bare|headed, braid their hair behind, in two floating tails; and, when they go out, tie the &s;ame kind of embroider|ed handkerchief, or cloth, about their heads; but mar|ried women are a&s;hamed, particularly before their fa|ther-in-law, to go bare-headed. All the women wear breeches, and &s;hifts of coar&s;e linen, and a long outer garment of cloth, or linen, with clo&s;e &s;leeves, and a fall-down cape, like that of the Wotiaks. The lower &s;eam of the garment is embroidered with various co|loured thread, and ornamented with coloured cro&s;&s;es. The &s;hift, on the bo&s;om, is embroidered in the &s;ame
<PB N="244" REF="251">
way, and kept together with two or three large bra&s;s buckles. They often wear armlets, or rings, on their arms; and wrap up their legs to an enormous thick|ne&s;s, like the Mordvine women.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es are richer than tho&s;e of the Mordvines, Wotiaks, or Finlanders; they are &s;cattered about, but without enclo&s;ures, and generally con&s;i&s;t of a winter and &s;ummer apartment, with a portico and &s;tairs. Their inward con&s;truction is wholly Tartarian.</P>
<P>They are indu&s;trious hu&s;bandmen, rich in corn, and in no want of hor&s;es or horned cattle. They keep al&s;o a quantity of bees. The T&s;cheremi&s;&s;ian heathens, of which there are many, celebrate &s;ome of the Ru&s;&s;ian fe&s;tivals; &s;uch as the week after Chri&s;tmas, and the Carnival, but only by banqueting and drinking. They have al&s;o a &s;trong belief in &s;ome Ru&s;&s;ian &s;aint, and in the Mahomet of the Tartars, whom they call <HI>Piambar</HI> (Prophet). Their own great &s;olemnities are thrice a year; the fea&s;t of &s;pring, &s;imilar to the Saban, a field-fea&s;t of the Tartars, is celebrated a little before Mid&s;ummer; every one then cleans him&s;elf in a bath, puts on clean under-garments, and a&s;&s;embles for the general &s;acrifice, when a red-brown hor&s;e, and a white cow are &s;olemnly &s;laughtered in the keremet, the fat, blood, and bones of which are burnt, and their &s;kins &s;u&s;pended on poles during the general &s;uppli|cation. Their &s;econd fe&s;tival, like that of the Wo|tiaks,
<PB N="245" REF="252">
is called <HI>Uginda,</HI> and celebrated before hay-har|ve&s;t, its principal object is Agebaren, the god of Plenty, and to &s;upplicate his ble&s;&s;ing on the harve&s;t. The third is the fea&s;t of general thanks after harve&s;t. They begin their new year with the Carnival week in March, and this is the commencement of &s;pring.</P>
<P>"The T&s;cheremi&s;&s;es" &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI> <Q>call them&s;elves <HI>Mai,</HI> men, and are &s;ettled in the government of Ca&s;an and Ninei-Novorogod on both &s;hores of the Wolga, but chiefly along the left &s;ide of that great river, quite into Permia. They are of Finni&s;h origin, and &s;peak a language peculiar to them&s;elves, but have no books or writings. During the &s;ov|reignty of the Tartars, they were like the Wotiaks, &s;ubject to that people.</Q></P>
<P>Though I &s;pell, the word <HI>Tartars</HI> according to the old pronunciation; yet the original word is <HI>Tatars,</HI> and the French and German writers have within the&s;e few years adopted this orthography; but, as it will re|quire a better authority, than mine, to change the &s;pel|ling, I have continued it according to the old method, as I have in calling the city Mo&s;cow, which &s;hould be pronounced <HI>Mo&s;kva.</HI></P>
<P><Q>The T&s;cheremi&s;&s;es, though formerly they had princes of their own, now have neither princes nor nobles, and tho' in early times they led pa&s;toral
<PB N="246" REF="253">
lives, being confined to a &s;mall di&s;trict, they are obliged now to turn their thoughts to agriculture.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Their farms con&s;i&s;t of a hut of only one room for the family, a few &s;tables and outhou&s;es in the yard, detached from each other, and &s;everal, little magazines built each on a perpendicular bank, which &s;erve them al&s;o for chambers in the &s;ummer-&s;ea&s;on; all the&s;e buildings are of wood, forming a &s;quare, the area of which, between the different huts, is all open. Their rooms for winter are built at the height of about 4 or 5 feet, over a cellar, to which you a&s;|cend by a few clum&s;y &s;teps, under a covering of planks. Each room contains, be&s;ides an oven, a hearth for culinary purpo&s;es and a broad bench for the family to &s;leep on; &s;ometimes the kitchen is in the dwelling-hou&s;e, and often is called the Black|room, and black enough, in truth, it is, from the &s;moke which has no chimney or vent; the doors of, their rooms are very low, and in&s;tead of a window, a hole is made about a foot and a half &s;quare, covered with a bladder, or linen, as a &s;ub&s;titute for gla&s;s. Their furniture is like that of the Ru&s;&s;ian villagers. The woman are employed as are the Wotiaks, and in|deed the two nations re&s;emble each other in their per&s;ons, manners, and way of living.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The dre&s;s of the men is nearly like that of the Ru&s;&s;ians, excepting that they comb their hair &s;traight
<PB N="247" REF="254">
down from the crown, and then cut it all round near|ly clo&s;e to the head. The collar, wai&s;tbands and bo&s;oms of their &s;hirts are embroidered with colour|ed wor&s;ted; their coat is made of a coar&s;e Ru&s;&s;ian cloth, compo&s;ed of black-wool, and the cape like that of an Engli&s;h &s;urtout, and an opening in the &s;kirts on each &s;ide; &s;uch al&s;o is the dre&s;s of the Wotiak men.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The dre&s;s of the married women is the &s;ame with that of the unmarried, only better worked; they wear trow&s;ers, and in&s;tead of &s;tockings, wrap their legs in linen rags, and often when they ride, with hay-bands, fa&s;tening them on with a ru&s;h, or a piece of packthread, wound &s;everal times round the calf. Their &s;hoes are made of the bark of trees, cut into &s;lips and matted. In &s;ummer they wear only a &s;hift, which is not tucked into the trow&s;ers, but hangs loo&s;e all round them. It is al&s;o at the neck and wri&s;ts cut into a &s;hape and comes down to the knees; the neck, wri&s;tbands and &s;eams all covered with a whim&s;ical embroidery of different-coloured wor&s;ted. A large buckle holds it together on the bo&s;om, and a girdle round the wai&s;t. When they would be more dre&s;&s;ed, they put over this &s;hift a habit like a morn|ing gown, made of various coloured cloths and toler|ably fine, and edge it with brown fur. Their caps are in the &s;hape of a cone, made of birch-bark, covered with linen or &s;tuff, and ornamented with
<PB N="248" REF="255">
gla&s;s-beads, little, white &s;hells, and flowers. From this cap, a ribband, three inches broad, ornamented as the cap, falls down the back. Some wear a broad ribband on the forehead, covered with pieces of money and beads, in&s;tead of the conical cap. Others wear a number of rings, thimbles, and all &s;orts of jingling pendants, at their girdles, which ornaments reach down to the joint of the knee be|hind; and as they walk, thus curiou&s;ly adorned, the&s;e trappings are offen&s;ive to the ear.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The women, like the Ru&s;&s;ian country-women, generaly chu&s;e to lie-in, in the bath-rooms. The fir&s;t man that vi&s;its her, after her delivery, names the child, if it is a boy, and the fir&s;t woman, if a girl; the child|ren call &s;uch per&s;ons afterward <HI>Atai,</HI> Name-father; and <HI>Abai,</HI> Name-mother. Common names of males are, <HI>Sengoul, Ki&s;pelat, Erbaldi, Ilmet,</HI> &amp;c. of females, <HI>Pide|let, A&s;tan, Na&s;ouke,</HI> &amp;c. hu&s;band and wife they call <HI>Mari</HI> and <HI>Vata.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The wife is here purcha&s;ed, as in other Tartar nations, and the u&s;ual price paid is, from 30 to 50 ru|bles; &s;ome are worth 80, and there are girls that will fetch a 100. As wives are de&s;tined to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and labour, it often happens that a rich father buys wives for his &s;ons, when they are no more than &s;ix years old, yet the wives are never younger than fifteen; the wife's portion con&s;i&s;ts of cattle, &s;o that a boy

married thus early, finds them&s;elf, at the age of ma|turity, often in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a numerous flock. De|grees of kindred are ob&s;erved among them in their matrimonial contracts, and though if one &s;i&s;ter dies, they make no &s;cruple of marrying the other, yet one man never marries two &s;i&s;ters at the &s;ame time. A boys' name-father commonly a&s;ks a daughter in mar|riage for his name-&s;on, and when he has concluded the bargain, the young people are permitted to vi&s;it one another, and then perform the ceremony of changing rings, which is called, <HI>Schergas va&s;lal|tas.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>On the day of marriage, the bridegroom, ac|companied by his friends, goes to the bride's hou&s;e; and as they have mu&s;icians playing before them, numbers of people join the proce&s;&s;ion, as it pa&s;&s;es through the villages. The bridegroom then pays the re&s;t of the purcha&s;e money, di&s;tributes pre&s;ents, and after this, the whole company &s;its down to eat and make-merry; the next day, the bride, being covered with a veil, he takes her home, notwith&s;tanding all the tears &s;he &s;heds, and all the re&s;i&s;tance &s;he makes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the hou&s;e where the nuptial ceremonies are per|formed, a <HI>Kart,</HI> or prie&s;t rehear&s;es a prayer before the Idol of the hou&s;e placed on a table; the prayer ended, a fea&s;t and diver&s;ion &s;ucceeds, with &s;ongs and
<PB N="250" REF="258">
dances, and the &s;ound of the <HI>Gou&s;li,</HI> the <HI>Schibber</HI> and the <HI>Koba&s;ch.</HI> During the&s;e different amu&s;ements, they take the bride apart and transform her into a woman; that is to &s;ay, they dre&s;s her as a married woman. The hu&s;band then conducts her into the eating-room, when the <HI>Kart</HI> repeats another prayer, the bride kneeling before him. After this ceremony; &s;he di&s;tributes pre&s;ents, often beer or mead, to every gue&s;t, and then returns into her hut. In the evening, the bride undre&s;&s;es her&s;elf, but it is not without a deal of re&s;i&s;tance, that &s;he &s;uffers the bridewomen to put her to bed. On the entrance of the bridegroom, the door is barricaded, and the next morning, he that repre&s;ented the father of the bride enters the nuptial chambers with a whip in his hand. If, after proper enquiries, there appear no token of virginity, he &s;hows the bride the whip in a threatning manner, and, in a day or two after, makes her feel the la&s;h of it. In this manner, according to the degree of crimination, they puni&s;h the levities and mi&s;conduct of their wives, and their negligence in the duties of marriage. The morrow of the wedding-day is &s;pent, al&s;o, in jollity, and every one, on returning, throws into the la&s;t cup he takes, &s;ome copecs, as a pre&s;ent to the new-married folks. Among the chri&s;tian T&s;cheremi&s;&s;es, almo&s;t all the weddings are preceded by this pagan marriage, and often a long time prior to their &s;olemnization by the chri&s;tian prie&s;t. Nor is it uncommon for a T&s;cheremi&s;&s;ian-rake
<PB N="251" REF="259">
to take the liberty of di&s;pen&s;ing with this cere|mony; he lays hold of the girl, takes her home, and as &s;oon as &s;he is with child, gives her father as much for her as he thinks proper.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Interring the dead, they dre&s;s the decea&s;ed in his be&s;t cloaths, and put him into a <HI>Schupar,</HI> or cof|fin. The burial is performed on the day of the per&s;on's death, and the proce&s;&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts of per&s;ons of both &s;exes. The grave is dug ea&s;t and we&s;t, and the head of the corp&s;e is laid to the we&s;t. As they believe, with the generality of the Pagans, that the exi&s;tence after death, is but a prolongation of their actual life, a few particulars excepted, the friends of the decea&s;ed put a number of copecs into his girdle, and furni&s;h him with certain, other things that have been necce&s;&s;ary to him in life; &s;uch as a la&s;t for making &s;hoes upon, a &s;tick to drive the dogs from him, and a little bunch of ro&s;e-tree twigs for repel|ling evil &s;pirits. As &s;oon as the grave is filled up, every one of the company places a little torch on the grave of each of his departed friends through|out the Sulugartla or cemetery, repeating &s;everal times, <HI>Live in harmony and friend&s;hip;</HI> he then takes a cake, and having eaten part of it, near each of the lighted torches, lays three pieces of it on every grave and &s;ays, <HI>This is for thee.</HI> The ceremony clo&s;es with placing over the grave a &s;heet of linen fa&s;tened to a pale, like a flag. On their return home,
<PB N="252" REF="260">
they bathe and change their cloaths, throwing away the old cloaths of the decea&s;ed, and hanging out the &s;erviceable ones, to be purified in the air. Like the Wotiaks, they honour the dead with commemoration-fe&s;tivals, and the whole village, every year, cele|brates a general one.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Their religion is idolatry, and in the performance of it, they implicitly follow the precepts of their prie&s;ts, who are al&s;o magicians, the interpreters of dreams, and the foretellers of fortune. Every com|munity replaces the Kart, or prie&s;t, by its own elec|tion, and they take care to be&s;tow the charge on a man reputed for di&s;cretion and re&s;pectable for his age and irreproachable manners. To every prie&s;t is given an <HI>Oud&s;chou</HI> or &s;ub-pre&s;byter, as an a&s;&s;i&s;t|ant.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Youma,</HI> in their language, is the general name for God; and that the Almighty may be completely happy, they give him a wife, called, <HI>Youmon-ava,</HI> mother of the gods. They have inferior divinities and conceive them to be the offspring of the two &s;upreme deities, and that the government of the world is their proper inheritance, as the &s;ons of god; &s;ome of whom are married, and others live in celibacy. The men addre&s;s the gods, and the women the godde&s;&s;es. With them the devil, whom they call <HI>Schaitan,</HI> is the parent and origin of the malevolent god. He
<PB N="253" REF="261">
hath his dwelling in the water, and di&s;&s;eminates ca|lamities, misfortunes and di&s;a&s;ters. But the object of their greate&s;t fear is <HI>Koudort&s;cha,</HI> the god of thunder, to who&s;e power they a&s;cribe the fertility of the earth and plenteous harve&s;t: they repre|&s;ent him under the figure of a puppet, cloathed in T&s;cheremi&s;&s;ian garments, put him into a box made of the bark of birch, and place it a corner of the hou&s;e. They, like the Wotiaks, keep fe&s;tival days, on which they &s;acrifice animals, and with &s;imilar ceremonies.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the government of Ca&s;an, the number of bap|tized T&s;cheremi&s;&s;es is calculated, from 1724 to 1774, to be 6,580 males and 5,951 females; but the greater part of the&s;e new converts, celebrate &s;ecretly the pagan fe&s;tivals, or at lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t at the ceremonies of their heathen brethren, as much as they can, without being di&s;covered by the clergy, and puni&s;hed for their ob&s;tinacy.</Q></P>
<P>Soon after my arrival in Sarapul it began to thaw, and as I had planned my &s;ummer's tour, to be by wa|ter on the Kama and Wolga, and this place was un|favourable for the preparations nece&s;&s;ary; I &s;et out the 12th of March for Ca&s;an, a di&s;tance of 200 miles, and proceeded from thence on my return to Sarapul on the 7th of April. As this is not a journey of ob&s;er|vation, that having been done by profe&s;&s;or <HI>Falk,</HI> who
<PB N="254" REF="262">
&s;pent his winter here, I forbear &s;aying any thing on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>Sarapul.</HI> Sarapul, which was my re&s;idence in &s;pring, is &s;o populous a village, as to &s;urpa&s;s many market-towns. It lies along the high border of the Kama, chiefly at the bottom of a height, in which there is &s;till a decayed, wooden fortre&s;s, which is &s;aid to have been erected during the Ba&s;kirian troubles, a pa|ri&s;h-church, a hou&s;e for the bailiff, a court-hou&s;e, and a comptoir, two wooden churches, and 343 dwel|ling hou&s;es, built in very narrow, winding &s;treets, which are amazingly dirty in &s;pring and autumn. Through this place flows a brook into the Kama.</P>
<P>The villages under the juri&s;diction of Sarapul are mo&s;tly inhabited by hu&s;bandmen, and contain 2640 tributary heads. The Kama &s;upplies the inhabitants with plenty of fine fi&s;h, particularly the white &s;almon, <HI>(Eriox)</HI> and the inhabitants call it <HI>Kra&s;naja Kyba,</HI> which is u&s;ually caught from one and a half archines to two archines long.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An archine, or Ru&s;&s;ian ell, is &frac34; of an Engli&s;h yard.</NOTE> The only remarkable, &s;mall fi&s;hes in this river are fi&s;hes of pa&s;&s;age, which come annually up from the Wolga, among wich is the gold-fi&s;h <HI>(Clupea alo&s;a)</HI> and the T&s;chechon <HI>(Cyprinus cultratus).</HI></P>
<P>Between 50 and 80 miles above Sarapul, are two large iron-manufactories, belonging to the crown, in
<PB N="255" REF="263">
which more than 7000 Ca&s;anian pea&s;ants and 600 forge|men are employed, and where they forge annually from 130 to 150,000 puds of bar-iron, which is conveyed down the Kama in barges, and from thence on the Wolga to A&s;trachan, and &s;o to Peter&s;burgh. Both the&s;e manufactories are &s;o &s;ituated, as to have inexhau&s;tible woods for fire, and great plenty of water. I &s;peak here from actual knowledge, having vi&s;ited their works my&s;elf.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of April, I left Sarapul. The pea&s;ants about the river Kama begin now to increa&s;e among them&s;elves the lin&s;eed, or hemp-&s;eed of Wallachia, the fir&s;t &s;eeds of which were brought there by the coloni&s;ts from Poland. It is now planted with &s;uc|ce&s;s in the &s;outhern parts of the di&s;trict of Selengin|&s;kaja. On the Kama it grows three feet and a half high, and yields a far finer yarn then that of the common flax.</P>
<P>After travelling 380 miles, I reached the river Sama|ra, at Sorot&s;chinskaja, on the 5th of May, 1773. The bridge here, being not in a proper &s;tate to pa&s;s over, I &s;ent an expre&s;s to Bu&s;uluzkaja, in order to get proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this place, according to the order I had received for this purpo&s;e from the go|vernor of Orenburgh. I therefore pitched my tent in the plain and di&s;patched &s;ome of my people, and they not only brought with them on the 7th at night, the
<PB N="256" REF="264">
a&s;&s;i&s;tance I wanted, but a live, wild colt, which had been caught about eight days before, near Tozkaja-Krepo&s;t.</P>
<P>The tarpans or wild-hor&s;es have encrea&s;ed much within the&s;e few years in the &s;teps of this di&s;trict; for as the wild country between the Jaik and the Wolga has been uninhabited for a con&s;iderable time, the&s;e animals u&s;ed commonly in &s;ummer to advance as much towards the north as they could, in order to &s;helter them&s;elves from the trouble&s;ome in&s;ects, &s;corching heat, and avidity of pa&s;ture. I am &s;till more and more of opinion, that the wild hor&s;es, found roving in the &s;teps of the Jaik, Don and Baraba, are chiefly the produce of &s;ome bewild|red Kirgue&s;e and Kalmuck hor&s;es, or of the &s;tallions of the Nomades belonging to this di&s;trict, with either &s;ingle mares or whole herds which they carried off. Hence the variety of colour and breed in the&s;e hor&s;es, tho' the chief are yellow, brown or yellowi&s;h. The colt brought to me was one of this colour, and was taken from its dam a few hours after it was dropt. If com|pared with a tame colt of the &s;ame age, it bore the following di&s;tinctive marks. It was taller, &s;tronger limbed, a larger head, with more hair about the mouth, the ears con&s;iderably longer, and the points bent more forwards; he carried his ears generally backward, like a biting hor&s;e, and the forehead was much vaulted, the mane appeared to be thicker and extended further on the withers, the tail was blacki&s;h and not much
<PB N="257" REF="265">
different: the back was le&s;s, ro&s;e a little curved, the hoof &s;maller and more pointed, and the fetlocks curled; the colour was a fallow-fawn with a &s;tripe down the back, a blacki&s;h mane, and a&s;s-coloured about the mouth. It looked like a mare-colt; or filley; and the mother, ac|cording to the accounts I received from the per&s;ons who caught it, was in company with &s;even other mares, that compo&s;ed the &s;uite of a wild &s;tallion of the &s;ame colour. <HI>(See the repre&s;entation in the plate, with Sajan Tartar digging Be&s;s).</HI></P>
<P>As far as I could learn, that wild &s;pecies of hor&s;e or a&s;s, called by the Kirgue&s;e and Kalmucks <HI>Kulan</HI> or <HI>Chulan,</HI> and which was never yet tamed, is not only different from the&s;e hor&s;es naturally wild, and called by the Kalmucks <HI>Takja,</HI> but al&s;o from the D&s;higgetei of the Mongols. Mo&s;t people de&s;cribed them to me as blui&s;h, or a&s;s-coloured, with a common a&s;s-cro&s;s on the &s;houlders. Others report that they are of a yel|low-brown colour, with a black &s;tripe down the back and a double cro&s;s &s;tripe over the &s;houlders, with &s;horter ears than tho&s;e of a&s;&s;es, and a cow-tail like the D&s;higgetei. The la&s;t de&s;cription I received from an old Co&s;&s;ack, who had e&s;caped from Kirgue&s;e captivity, is, that the Chulan is a medium between the D&s;higgetei and the a&s;s. According to the fir&s;t account they &s;hould be the <HI>Onagri</HI> of the ancients; and all agree, that the Chulan is &s;o wild as not to be tamed, and &s;wifter than the fleete&s;t hor&s;e.

<P>On the 14th of May I arrived at Jaizkoi Gorodok, and found the condition of the Jaikian Co&s;&s;acks much changed &s;ince I was there, and by their own fault. The former liberty and con&s;titution of their court of waiwodes was no more, but Lieutenant-Colonel <HI>Sima|nof</HI> governor of Jaizkoi, commanded them, and had two of the fir&s;t Starchins or elders, whom the fury of the people had &s;pared in the troubles of 1771, for his a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors. Four battalions of light troops, and a certain number of irregular regiments were quartered in forts before the city and within, al&s;o, to keep the peace. Many Co&s;&s;acks, even of the rank of Starchin, to avoid puni&s;hment, were obliged to leave their effects and fly, and &s;ome few, who e&s;caped from pri&s;on, were roving in the &s;treet, and living upon a mi&s;erable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, which they obtain by hunting, or privily from their friends. Though matters were not yet &s;ettled, they were under proper regulations re&s;pecting the fi&s;heries, and one battalion was quartered on the Kirgui&s;ian &s;ide, to prevent any ho&s;tile &s;urprize, and another, as u&s;ual, at|tended the fi&s;heries, commanded by an officer they called <HI>Jertaul.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="267">The hor&s;es and guides being ready for my departure, on the 19th I &s;et off at noon, with an e&s;cort of twelve co&s;&s;acks for Sundaef, in order to meet Mr. <HI>Surjef,</HI> whom I had &s;ent before to gather the vernal plants on the mountains of Inde&s;koi, and arrived there the 21&s;t. On the 24th, we left Sundaef, and took our farewell of the Jaik for good, directing our journey &s;outh-ea&s;twards, through the de&s;art &s;tep, and the next day, in the&s;e wilds, I met with an interpreter in his wayfrom A&s;trachan, &s;ent with di&s;patches to Orenburgh. This was the &s;ame per&s;on I had met at Stauropal in 1769; he was over|joyed to &s;ee me, and we &s;pent the night (with his e&s;cort, con&s;i&s;ting of four Kalmucks) on the &s;ame &s;pot.</P>
<P>On the &s;teps of the river Ku&s;chum, the Saigaks, or &s;tep-goats were &s;een, &s;ometimes &s;ingly and &s;ometimes in large flocks. The Co&s;&s;acks, in &s;ummer, when they have nothing el&s;e to do, go out in &s;mall parties to hunt the&s;e animals, and being unable to con&s;ume the fle&s;h or carry it home, &s;kin the be&s;t of them, and carry off &s;uch &s;kins and their horns. They had al&s;o many horns of tho&s;e that have been killed by wolves or other ac|cidents, which they &s;ell to the Chine&s;e merchants. On the Jaik a couple of Saigak horns are &s;old from ten to fifteen copecs, but on the Chine&s;e frontiers for four times the price. The Co&s;&s;acks of the Jaik, who kill annually a great number of the&s;e animals, a&s;|&s;ure me that there &s;ome with three horns; and two or
<PB N="260" REF="268">
the Co&s;&s;acks, in my e&s;cort, declared they once killed two, that had but one horn each.</P>
<P>Every where on this &s;tep, where the titmou&s;e makes a hole, is a quantity of mu&s;cle, and other &s;ea-&s;hells, calcined by the weather, by lying on the &s;urface of the ground; but underneath the &s;oil, in dry, loamy ground, they are found entire, having been &s;o pre&s;erved a great number of years, &s;ince the time that the Ca&s;pian &s;ea covered this di&s;trict. The whole &s;tep along the Ku&s;chum is arid and dreary, and the &s;oil &s;alt; of cour&s;e unfit for any kind of hu&s;bandry, or even for rearing of cattle. The lowe&s;t &s;pots are &s;carce green in &s;pring, and there is not a tree to be &s;een. On this &s;tep we took up our night's lodging.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we were &s;topping on the 30th of May, on one of the &s;teps to feed our hor&s;es, &s;ome one of our company had kindled a fire; and the wind being high, blew it among the high gra&s;s and &s;et fire to it. It bur&s;t out with great rage, and the flame ran like wild-fire, &s;o as to &s;et the whole &s;pot in a blaze, and we had &s;carce time to &s;ave our waggons, and avoid the fire by running from it. This day we met &s;ome armed people on hor&s;eback, who were undoubtedly vagabond Co&s;|&s;acks, from the Jaikian di&s;trict of Umno. We were obliged to lie all the next night under arms. No in|terruption however en&s;ued, and the next day we travelled on, reached &s;ome quick&s;and hills, and met
<PB N="261" REF="269">
with, between them, the fir&s;t water-pit we had &s;een, and indeed the fir&s;t water for many days. Yet, notwith|&s;tanding we had water with us, and a great number of young toads were &s;wimming in the&s;e pits, we were induced to make our tea with it, and found it excellent. This &s;ame evening we were &s;aluted near the water-pits, by that &s;carce, black &s;tep-lark <HI>(Alauda Tartarica),</HI> which I have &s;poken of before. They flew here either &s;ingly, or in couples, and may be compared in flight and &s;ong to the <HI>Alauda Calandra.</HI> Here al&s;o in this &s;andy de&s;art was plenty of tho&s;e venemous &s;erpents I have mentioned, <HI>Phalangium araneoides,</HI> and a large &s;pe|cies of beetle <HI>(Carabus bucida).</HI> If it be true, as the Kalmucks &s;ay, that the bite of the&s;e beetles of prey is &s;ometimes mortal to cattle, they may be &s;aid to be the <HI>bupre&s;tis</HI> of the ancients. This &s;and-de&s;art, which we had ju&s;t got upon, is called by the Kalmucks <HI>naryn</HI> (the &s;mall &s;and). It begins at 49 deg. N. latitude, between the Great U&s;en and the &s;alt-lake Altannnor, joins a tract of hills, and continues uninterrupted in the middle di&s;trict, between the Wolga and the Jaik, as far as the Northern coa&s;t of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea. There it forms a cape. This &s;andy de&s;art, in general, con&s;i&s;ts of large, green &s;and-layers, which ri&s;e flat above the &s;alt loams, and &s;cattered with high, quick-&s;and hills, like little mountains.</P>
<P>Though this &s;and &s;eems very unfavourable to the growth of vegetables, yet the plains are full of green, juicy, and fine plants, the cau&s;e of which is the
<PB N="262" REF="270">
wonderful nature of this di&s;trict, being &s;o full of &s;alt|&s;prings. By digging, the Kalmucks have found large water-pits. This &s;andy de&s;art has &s;ome rare and cu|rious plants. The high, quick&s;and hills are full of <HI>elymus, arundo, et carex arenaria.</HI> In&s;tead of trees, na|ture has provided the&s;e &s;and heaps with bu&s;hes.

The bu&s;h properly blooms about the middle of May. The fruit is large and beautiful, has green, yellow, or hand&s;ome red-&s;haded wings, and the &s;ame ta&s;te as the branches of the plant; if chewed, &s;omething like that of &s;ouri&s;h apples. For this rea&s;on the Kalmucks burn the branches when dry, and con&s;ider the &s;moke as beneficial to the eyes. The repre&s;en|tation given by <HI>Tournefort</HI> in his <HI>Corollarium,</HI> is quite fal&s;e.</NOTE>), which has
<PB N="263" REF="271">
no where been di&s;covered except by me here, upon &s;ome &s;and-mountains on the Southern Wolga, and about the mouth of the river Kama, and by <HI>Tourne|fort,</HI> at the bottom of Mount Ararat. It had now, on all it's branches, full grown-fruit, which gave a beautiful appearance to the bu&s;h, &s;eemingly created for a &s;andy &s;oil, and who&s;e roots extend often to the depth of many fathoms. As abundantly grew here the <HI>Artemi&s;ia &s;antonicum,</HI> with thick and woody &s;talks, which ri&s;e in autumn to the height of &s;everal fathoms. Here grows al&s;o the <HI>Prenanthes Chondrilloides,</HI> changed into a bu&s;h.</P>
<P>The olde&s;t and be&s;t water-pits, in the vallies between the hills, are &s;ometimes delightfully &s;haded with fine narrow-leaved willows, and the wild olive-tree <HI>(Elae|agnus),</HI> or &s;mall, white poplar-bu&s;hes, whereof the for|mer become often fine and tall trees.</P>
<P>The plants that cloath this &s;andy de&s;art are many, "but not being entertaining to a general reader, I will not enumerate them." Of animals, this di&s;trict abounds with wolves, foxes, antelopes, and in reedy vallies, wild boars, little titmice, and race-hares. Of birds, none (except near &s;ome &s;prings and &s;alt-mar&s;hes) but the Bergander, common &s;mall larks, large black ones, &s;parrows in great numbers, and &s;tep-hawks <HI>(Falco lanarius),</HI> which build their ne&s;ts on low trees in the vallies. I met with but few &s;erpents, except the
<PB N="264" REF="272">
lizard-&s;erpent, in low, gra&s;&s;y vallies <HI>(Lacerta apoda),</HI> and &s;till fewer vipers.</P>
<P>We were &s;everal days travelling in this de&s;art, en|camping on it every night. One day we met with &s;ome pretty partridges, with long, pointed wings; they have uncommonly &s;hort feet, and fly almo&s;t like pidgeons; as they drink often, they are &s;eldom &s;een far from the water-pits, and when the&s;e are dried up, they retire about the Southern Wolga. Their food is the feeds of the <HI>A&s;tragalus cicer &amp; alopecuroides,</HI> but in autumn the &s;alt-plants. They generally fly &s;ingle, and in pairs, but, in autumn, in whole coveys. When they &s;oar, they &s;queak, but fly without noi&s;e. Their fle&s;h is good, but tough. They probably came from more Southern di&s;tricts, becau&s;e they had but ju&s;t began to breed, laying large white-eggs, like pullets eggs.</P>
<P>On this de&s;art is a mountain of rock-&s;alt, di&s;covered by the Kalmucks many years &s;ince. I went to &s;ee it. It is about &s;ix miles in circumference, and divided by a &s;alt-valley, making various windings, befet on each &s;ide with &s;tony hills. In a &s;alt &s;pot in this valley, Mr. <HI>Gmelin,</HI> when he was here, dug a trying pit, and found the rock-&s;alt pure as chry&s;tal, and reaching quite to the day or &s;urface of the ground. It cannot be a&s;cer|tained how far the &s;alt penetrates into the mountain, but there is no doubt of its advancing a great way.</P>

<P><PB N="265" REF="274">Our journey, on this &s;corching, &s;andy &s;tep, took us ten days, and having nothing to drink but the water we carried with us, which became foul in the ve&s;&s;els, and ab&s;olutely &s;tunk, I &s;carce know how to ex|pre&s;s the plea&s;ure we enjoyed at reaching a river on the further &s;ide of the &s;tep, where we hung over the &s;tream, men and hor&s;es, for a con&s;iderable time. On the road I had the plea&s;ure of being an eye witne&s;s of the gip&s;ey, or Egyptian-like way of living of a tribe of Tartars of Cuban extraction. They have about one thou&s;and tents, and have at pre&s;ent obtained per|mi&s;&s;ion to travel with their flocks along the river Ach|tuba, from T&s;chigit to near the &s;ea-&s;ide; they call them&s;elves <HI>Kundurau,</HI> and are, like mo&s;t Cuban Tar|tars, what the ancient geographers call <HI>Hamaxobites.</HI></P>

<P>We &s;aw three of their wandering tribes. Their jurts or tents are in form and &s;tructure different from tho&s;e of the Kalmucks, and other Nomades. They cannot be taken to pieces, "being &s;o interwoven with bu&s;hes," but being of much lighter &s;tructure, "and &s;carce twelve feet in diameter," can be put upon a large cart. The round wall of &s;uch a tent is a lattice-work of very &s;lender rods, and the roof a flatted vault of bent rods, one end of which is fa&s;tened to the lattice-work, and the other to a hoop that forms the &s;moke-hole, re|&s;embling
<PB N="266" REF="275">
our chicken-rips. The walls of this tent are covered with a reed-mat, and over the whole a light felt; &s;o that this covering needs not to be re|moved. In order to tran&s;port the&s;e tents, they put them on a cart, with two high wheels, &s;o as that the wheels are within the tent; on which they al&s;o load their timber, furniture, women and children, and thus wheel off all together. Rich men have two, or more, &s;uch tents, and carts, according to the number of their families; and they have al&s;o another cart covered, in which they &s;leep, with their wives. If they do not remain for a length of time in one place, they do not remove their tents from the cart, but fit under|neath it, and perform their work in the &s;hade of it; and, to prevent their young cattle from doing the &s;ame, they hurdle it in; but if they wi&s;h to make &s;ome &s;tay, they unload their carts, and hang in the &s;moke-hole, on the windward &s;ide, a felt, embroidered with the needle in coloured wor&s;ted, partly to prevent the &s;moke's beating down into the tent, and partly by way of or|nament. Their appearance is wild, and many of them are &s;oon &s;moke-dried, and &s;o much &s;corched with the &s;un, that they look like Indians. Their women, how|ever, when young, are pretty. In horned cattle they are rich; "they ride them in preference to hor&s;es;" and draw their carts by two or three oxen, yoked in &s;hafts, one before the other. They formerly paid a &s;mall, annual tribute to the khan of the Kalmucks, in cattle, butter, and other provi&s;ions; but are now free
<PB N="267" REF="276">
from every tax, and yet are continually robbing the Ru&s;&s;ian inhabitants and travellers. <Q>In manners, dre&s;s, way of living, &amp;c. they are like the Ba&s;ki|rians.</Q> Tho&s;e who cannot afford to keep cattle, maintain them&s;elves by following the trades of &s;hoe-making, tanning, and other handicrafts; whil&s;t &s;ome alleviate their poverty, by &s;heep-&s;tealing, and other kinds of rapine, which they exerci&s;e to advantage among their neighbours, and the nearer hordes.</P>
<P>At Selitrenoi-gorodok, on the river Achtuba, are the remains of two magnificent buildings, the mo&s;t &s;plen|did of which has been cleared from the rubbi&s;h, in which it was buried, partly for the &s;alt-petre found therein, and with which the &s;alt-petre-works adjoining are &s;upplied, and partly with the view of finding hidden trea&s;ures. The extent of this heap of rubbi&s;h, which marks the extent of the ancient, Nogayan city, which here &s;tood, is a mile and an half. The other ruin, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;ome man&s;ion, from the many little divi&s;ions of rooms in it. The former, from which has been dug out many valuable things, and coffins plated with &s;ilver, &s;eems to have been the mau&s;oleum of &s;ome khans, and a temple. The whole appears to have been erected in form of a long qua|drangle, from N. N. E. to S. S. W. and is about 12 fathoms long; and, on the &s;outh front, 9&frac12; fathoms broad. I remarked a judicious proportion in the divi|&s;ions, and the burial-vaults under the northern one;
<PB N="268" REF="277">
but the more &s;outhern front, who&s;e foundation-walls are &s;till the highe&s;t, and are now 14 feet above-ground, and have their foundations three-quarters of a yard thick, was embelli&s;hed with Gothic pillars and arches, the remains of which are &s;till to be &s;een. Throughout all the remaining buildings, reigns a mo&s;t regular mag|nificence; of which I never &s;aw an in&s;tance in any Tartarean ruins. The out&s;ide of the wall is not only ornamented with colours of green, yellow, white and blue, in triangular forms; but, in the chief points of the building, are the remains of Gothic carving, and Mo&s;aic workman&s;hip. Time, however, and the cove|tou&s;ne&s;s of the people, have many years &s;ince converted the&s;e relicks of antiquity, into heaps of &s;tone and rub|bi&s;h. Formerly, they loaded whole ve&s;&s;els with the bricks and tiles of the&s;e ruins, and conveyed them to A&s;trachan; and, in &s;o doing, for every 100 bricks they took away; they reduced, at lea&s;t, 2000 into u&s;ele&s;s rubbi&s;h. It is reported, that many coins, and valuable jewels, have been here found; but I doubt whether any of the&s;e objects have fallen into the hands of real amateurs; or into that trea&s;ure of inland anti|quities which the Academy of Sciences at Peter&s;burg has e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>A quarter of a mile to the north of this place, is a large tumulus that has been dug into; and to which the Kundurau, and other Tartars, when in this neigh|bourhood, come and &s;ay their prayers on it; from an
<PB N="269" REF="278">
opinion, that a &s;aint of their religion (Mahomedan) was here buried. The Tartars a&s;&s;ert, that this &s;aint &s;till performs miracles, cures the &s;ick, and &s;ometimes appears to them in their &s;leep; the effect of a weak imagination, among many other people in un-enlight|ened ages.</P>
<P>Not being more than about 65 miles from A&s;trachan, I re&s;olved to vi&s;it that place, accordingly paid off my e&s;cort, and &s;et off on the 10th of June, with po&s;t-hor&s;es. The road to that place is bad and difficult, owing to the number of quick&s;and-hills we are obliged to pa&s;s. The next &s;tation (eight miles) is Krugloi-go|rodok, or D&s;hamjanowa; &s;o called from the Kalmuck prince D&s;hamjanowa, who lately died here in a fine wood-built palace, with a chapel and adjoining &s;tables, erected for him at the expence of the Empre&s;s; and who&s;e widow and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;till re&s;ide in it, attended with a life-guard of Co&s;&s;acks. This whole di&s;trict is rich in &s;alt-petre; but I &s;hall not &s;ay more on that &s;ubject, it having been long &s;ince de&s;cribed by pre|ceding travellers.</P>
<P>I remained in A&s;trachan till the 10th of June, and took leave of Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Gmelin,</HI> who was preparing to take his &s;econd tour into Per&s;ia, which ended &s;o fatally to him. He was &s;eized by a Tartar prince and con|fined, under an idea that many Tartars were &s;laves in Ru&s;&s;ia, in which confinement he died. In my way back,
<PB N="270" REF="279">
I pa&s;&s;ed through the fortre&s;s Jenataef&s;koi, or Schina Balga&s;un (the new city), &s;ituate on an arm of the Wolga, 100 miles from A&s;trachan. It is a place badly peopled, being inhabited only by eight merchants, &s;ome reformed &s;oldiers, Co&s;&s;acks, and a few private per|&s;ons. It is a quadrangle, with good earth-walls, and four ba&s;tions. Within the fort are only Imperial build|ings, a hou&s;e for the governor, a man&s;ion formerly de|&s;igned for the khan of the Kalmucks, and a hou&s;e for the <HI>Pri&s;taf,</HI> or chief officer of the Kalmuck hordes. The man&s;ion of the khan is now inhabited by a Kal|muck prince, of Torgutian extraction, who has been baptized by the name of Alexei Dondukof, was brought up among the Imperial cadets at Peter&s;burg, and is advanced to the rank of colonel.</P>
<P>Near Zarizyn (the environs of which are become famous by the la&s;t and total overthrow of the traitor Pugat&s;chef, and his wretched followers, in Augu&s;t, 1774), is a kind of loam, which &s;eems to be fit for pot|ter's work, and becomes, in calcining, almo&s;t as red and tender as the Chine&s;e &s;ealing-wax. Some Turki&s;h pri&s;oners at Zarizyn, make of it a variety of little ve&s;&s;els, ink-&s;tands, tobacco-pipe-bowls, &amp;c. Many pieces of &s;elenites are found in the &s;ame loam.</P>
<P><HI>Colony of Sarepta.</HI> Within 30 miles of this place, on the brook Sarpa, is a fine colony of Moravian bre|thren, e&s;tabli&s;hed within the&s;e eight years, and called,
<PB N="271" REF="280">
by the founders, <HI>Sarepta.</HI> It was erected in the year 1765, and has been endowed, by the Empre&s;s, with many di&s;tingui&s;hed privileges. It was begun by five of the brethren, deputed by the re&s;t to make choice of a proper &s;pot, and to mark out the &s;cite of the chief hou&s;e. Since this time it has been annually increa&s;ed by families of the <HI>Unitas Fratrum,</HI> who voluntarily came here, as coloni&s;ts from Germany and Holland; &s;o that now, in 1773, it amounts to 250 per&s;ons of both &s;exes, and is yearly increa&s;ing by new comers. The place is not yet fini&s;hed, according to the plan laid down; yet con&s;i&s;ts of a con&s;iderable number of well-built hou&s;es, &s;ome of wood, and &s;ome of birch.</P>
<P>The large&s;t and fine&s;t building, is a new &s;tone-built chapel, con&s;i&s;ting of two &s;tories, and a turret, with a clock. Near it &s;tands two large edifices; one occupied by the unmarried brethren, and the other by the virgin &s;i&s;ters. They are all obliged to maintain them&s;elves by their own labour; and, every week, to depo&s;it a certain product of their labour, in the hands of their &s;uperior. The&s;e cannot marry, without the con&s;ent of their &s;uperior; who &s;eldom grants them this liberty, till they are advanced in life. Among the brethren in the former hou&s;e, are a number of good arti&s;ans, as taylors, &s;hoemakers, &s;tocking-weavers, tanners, up|hol&s;terers, black&s;miths, bakers, &s;kinners, &s;ilver&s;miths, &amp;c. al&s;o, a manufactory, where they make half-&s;ilks, cotton, and coloured linens, &s;tuffs and handkerchiefs,
<PB N="272" REF="281">
and all of quality; but, according to the cu&s;tom of all Moravian e&s;tabli&s;hments, they a&s;k a high price for their goods. Young women earn their living by needle-work, &s;pinning cotton, bleaching and knitting. Both buildings have con&s;iderable out-hou&s;es belonging to them, for the various purpo&s;es of hou&s;hold bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;tables, cow-hou&s;es, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The other public buildings are, an inn, with a brandy-di&s;tillery, a tallow-chandlery, a &s;oap-manu|factory, a place to make &s;nuff and tobacco, a di&s;pen|&s;atory, with a &s;aw-mill, a corn-mill, &amp;c. for which the Sarpa is dammed up. There are no more than ten principal hou&s;es, to each of which is a &s;mall kitchen-garden; and one hou&s;e for the phy&s;ician of the colony. Without the place, along the Sarpa, are &s;everal plantations of tobacco, which turn out very pro|fitably.</P>
<P>The town is fortified by a rampart, ditch, and che|vaux-de-frize, with &s;ix batteries, of two pieces of ar|tillery each; and it is otherwi&s;e fortified by nature. A &s;mall garri&s;on of &s;oldiers is quartered here in barracks, and relieved from Zarizyn.</P>
<P>Contiguous to the colony, they have e&s;tabli&s;hed a farm on an elevated plain, where they breed a great quantity of cattle; and, clo&s;e behind this, is a plen|tiful &s;pring of water, which, by pipes, &s;upplies the

town: a village is likewi&s;e begun in the neighbour|hood. The &s;oil is a &s;andy one, and, to all appear|ance, no plant can be cultivated to &s;o much advan|tage, as flax. The colony has a &s;hare in the fi&s;heries of the Wolga; and the Sarpa &s;upplies it with plenty of common fi&s;h. The &s;pring-&s;ea&s;on yields them river-game in abundance; and winter, a number of hares and partridges. In 1774, this colony had the misfor|tune to be plundered by the Be&s;arabian Tartars, who inhabit the &s;tep of Kuman; and the people thus lo&s;t great part of their property; but the Empre&s;s has determined to repair their lo&s;s, and protect them in future.</P>
<P>All the buildings here have been erected at the ex|pence of the community, and out of the general fund; and the proprietors of the hou&s;e pay a yearly rent of &s;ix <HI>per cent.;</HI> and, as the principal fund con&s;i&s;ts of a capital of 40,000 rubles, advanced by the Crown, with|out intere&s;t, for ten years, the&s;e annual rents will nearly, in the &s;aid ten years, repay the &s;um advanced. At the end of 30 years, they are to pay a quit-rent of 25 copecs for every de&s;ettine of land a&s;&s;igned them, of which they have about 4,000; each de&s;ettine, 560 Engli&s;h feet long by 280 wide; &s;o that the whole will amount to no more than 1,000 rubles, or 250&pound;. &s;terling. Such of the coloni&s;ts as wi&s;h to return to their own country, before the expiration of the &s;aid ten years, are obliged to re-imbur&s;e the &s;um of 32 rubles

each, which the Crown advanced them for their journey here. After the ten years, this 32 rubles is con&s;idered as a pre&s;ent to them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e advantages, the colony of Sarepta en|joys, beyond all other German colonies e&s;tabli&s;hed in this empire, the privilege of holding immediately of the chancery-wards at Peter&s;burg, without being dependent on any other province. To promote internal harmony, and order, they have cho&s;en pre&s;idents from among them&s;elves, and allowed them a hand&s;ome &s;tipend. Their prie&s;t has the title of a bi&s;hop; and the phy|&s;ician, and other officers, have annual &s;alaries, from the general fund. They have, likewi&s;e, a male and female warden, to pre&s;ide over the choirs of the unmarried brethren and &s;i&s;ters, and maintain that &s;trict di&s;cipline, for which the &s;ect is characteri&s;ed. To the&s;e over&s;eers are given a certain number of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, &s;elected from their own body, who are called coun&s;ellors; the&s;e, with the pa&s;tors, admini&s;trator, and warden of the bachelors, compo&s;e an a&s;&s;embly, called, <HI>the college of wardens;</HI> who&s;e office it is to attend the temporal intere&s;ts of the community, to decide di&s;putes, and inflict eccle|&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline; in &s;hort, they have a power, &s;ubject to very few limitations. Be&s;ides this, they have a &s;e|condary council, called, <HI>the a&s;&s;i&s;ting conference,</HI> before whom matters are brought, prior to their being laid before the college. La&s;tly, there is al&s;o an a&s;|&s;embly of grown-up men, that have been admitted
<PB N="275" REF="284">
to the communion, and called, <HI>the great common-council.</HI> The&s;e a&s;&s;emble once a month, when every one is at liberty to propo&s;e what he plea&s;es; and all is de|termined by a plurality of voices. Nothing can be altered that is once e&s;tabli&s;hed, but with the con|currence of this other hou&s;e; and the over&s;eers, or wardens, are obliged to give an account of their admini&s;tration, to the great council, at the end of every year.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e things, only for the information of tho&s;e readers who are unacquainted with the regulations of this &s;ect of people, made by <HI>Crantz;</HI> and to amu&s;e them further, I will add a &s;hort account of their &s;everal &s;piritual meetings.</P>
<P>The &s;ettled order of their religious a&s;&s;emblies is never interrupted, or changed, unle&s;s for very cogent rea&s;ons. They are &s;ometimes held in public, with the doors open to every comer; and &s;ometimes in private, for the communicants, or for the choirs of unmarried brethren, or &s;i&s;ters. This private meeting is &s;tiled, <HI>the congregation of the choirs.</HI> By an e&s;tabli&s;hed order, two a&s;&s;emblies are held every week-day; and three, or even four, on Sundays. In winter, the week-day a&s;|&s;emblies do not commence till &s;even in the evening; and when it is public, it is called, <HI>the hour of lecture,</HI> becau&s;e they then read aloud &s;ome chapters from the bible, or a &s;ermon. Sometimes, al&s;o, the mini&s;ter
<PB N="276" REF="285">
preaches, particularly on Wedne&s;day, and &s;ometimes on Friday. But this a&s;&s;embly is not always general; for twice a week, and, at certain times, thrice a week, the fraternity of the holy &s;upper hold their a&s;&s;emblies of devotion, in which a hymn is con&s;tantly &s;ung. At times, likewi&s;e, any accounts particularly intere&s;ting, that may have been received from the brethren &s;pread abroad in other countries, are read aloud. In &s;ummer-time, this fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly is transfered to eight in the morning; but the &s;econd, is always at nine in the even|ing, and is called, <HI>the hour of &s;inging,</HI> becau&s;e ver&s;es from &s;acred canticles are &s;ung. The Sunday a&s;&s;emblies have their order: namely, the litanies at eight in the morning; that is to &s;ay, one public and &s;olemn prayer, at ten a &s;ermon, and at eight in the evening another &s;ermon, called, <HI>the hour of commons.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord's Supper is celebrated every four weeks, and is preceded by a &s;pecial and very rigid confe&s;&s;ion, and &s;ub&s;equent ab&s;olution. This private confe&s;&s;ion, is termed, <HI>the &s;peaking;</HI> and is heard by the admini&s;trator in each of the choirs, who exerci&s;es, in this office, the utmo&s;t of his authority. All the communicants receive the &s;acrament at the &s;ame time; and the admini&s;tering eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who are cho&s;en for every a&s;&s;embly, by the bi&s;hop, from the admini&s;trators and wardens, are then cloathed in white &s;urplices, whereas, at other acts of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">votion, they preach in a &s;ecular habit of any colour, &s;itting at a table.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="286">What is called, <HI>the congregation of choirs</HI> (for the men and women are divided into different choirs), is their hours of prayer, or the extraordinary prayers of the unmarried brethren and &s;i&s;ters. This is held at the di&s;cretion of either divi&s;ion; or as the admini&s;trator directs. The &s;ignal for the&s;e private a&s;&s;emblies, is made by the &s;ound of a horn, or trumpet; whereas, that of public a&s;&s;emblies, is, by tolling a bell.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e meetings, they have another, called, <HI>a love fea&s;t.</HI> At the&s;e times, they meet in the hall, that &s;erves for a church, and are pre&s;ented with white bread and tea, the di&s;tribution of which is accompanied by mu&s;ick, and &s;piritual &s;ongs. Exclu&s;ion from the&s;e <HI>agapae,</HI> is looked on as the &s;econd degree of eccle&s;ia&s;t|ical puni&s;hment, and is commonly preceded by a pro|hibition from the communion, on the eve of which &s;a|crament they are held; as, al&s;o, on tho&s;e of the prin|cipal fea&s;t days. In the&s;e bapti&s;ms they u&s;e no exor|ci&s;m. The child is brought to the font, god-fathers and god-mothers an&s;wer for it, as in other churches, and the infant is &s;prinkled three times on the brea&s;t. Who would not &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e repeated exerci&s;es of piety, &s;hould enable a man to conquer his pa&s;&s;ions, de|&s;troy every vicious affection of the heart, and render the members of &s;uch a &s;ociety, patterns of true and exemplary holine&s;s! Yet they often give way to human frailties, corrupt manners are but too vi&s;ible among them; and the excellent rules of this &s;ect are always the mo&s;t favourable &s;ide, in which it can be viewed.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="287">The burial of their dead is attended by no cere|monial rites: no &s;ighs, no complaints are to be heard, nor any mourning &s;een; on the contrary, they dre&s;s them&s;elves with more than ordinary care on the&s;e occa|&s;ions, to indicate the &s;atisfaction they have, that an|other per&s;on has run his career of duty, and is gone to lay hold of the crown of everla&s;ting life.

<P><HI>The Ca&s;pian &s;ea.</HI> On the left, or we&s;tern &s;ide of the river Sarpa, there extends to the &s;outhward, into the &s;tep, a ridge of ground, de&s;cribing a number of bays and promontories, and which, &s;een from below, has the appearance of a chain of hills, when, in fact, it is no more than the &s;lope of a country very much ele|vated. This high bank extends from Sarepta, along the Wolga, and thence towards the north, as far as the middle El&s;henka, which runs nine miles, above the co|lony, into the above river. Now, this &s;udden elevation of ground, the bay and creeks which it forms, and e&s;|pecially the &s;aline quality of the low loam-&s;tep below, who&s;e &s;urface is mixed with va&s;t quantities of mu&s;cle-&s;hells, gives birth to the mo&s;t probable, geographical conjectures, not only about the antient &s;tate of the Kuman, the Kalmuck and Jaikian &s;teps, which are &s;o thoroughly like each other, but al&s;o, concerning the extent of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, in the remote ages of the
<PB N="279" REF="288">
world; and on the communication it may have had with the Euxine &s;ea: conjectures which coincide with the opinion of M. <HI>Tournefort,</HI> who has been ever ac|knowledged an accurate ob&s;erver, though he might advance and &s;ay a great deal, with great appearance of truth, on the ancient &s;eparation of the Euxine from the Mediterranean; on the ri&s;e of the waters of the former above the level of the latter, and of the influx of this water into the Mediterranean; probably in the deluge of Deucalion.</P>
<P>That multitude of &s;hells &s;cattered over all the &s;teps of the Jaik, the Wolga, and the Kalmucks; &s;hells &s;imilar, in all re&s;pects, to tho&s;e found in the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, and never met with in rivers; that uniformity of &s;oil, in all parts of the&s;e &s;teps; con&s;i&s;ting of nothing el&s;e (except in places covered with a flying &s;and) than a pure &s;and, connected with &s;uch &s;lime as is &s;ound at the bottom of the &s;ea, or a yellowi&s;h clay, without the &s;malle&s;t appearance of turf, or any layers of mineral earth, till we come to a bed of clay, at a very con|&s;iderable depth; that general, &s;aline quality of the &s;oil; the innumerable flats, and lakes of &s;alt-water; and, above all, that continued equality of country, in all the&s;e va&s;t de&s;arts, are &s;o many inconte&s;tible proofs, that they mu&s;t have been covered formerly by the waters of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea: and, though the&s;e plains have been for&s;aken by the &s;ea, for a great number of ages, yet, whether by the effect of the aridity of a hot climate,
<PB N="280" REF="289">
whether in con&s;equence of the &s;altne&s;s inherent to them, and maintained by the clayey nature of the in|ferior &s;tratum; in &s;hort, whether by an effect of that property, they have only produced plants, requiring a &s;aline earth and water, and which, by their decay, make but little earth, and a great deal of &s;alt; from whatever cau&s;e it be, yet the&s;e plains have never hi|therto been cloathed with vegetable earth, or turf; or by any kind of wood whatever.</P>
<P>It is then plain, that the elevated ground, between the Don and Wolga, as well as the high lands between the Wolga and the Jaik, have been the ancient banks of the Hyrcanian &s;ea; for it is in the&s;e high lands, that the di&s;po&s;ition of the earth, in &s;trata, is fir&s;t di&s;covered, that the general &s;altne&s;s of the ground fir&s;t di&s;appears, that its &s;urface is covered with black mould and turf, and that the marine productions peculiar to the Ca&s;|pian &s;ea, are no where to be met with; and if we meet with whole banks of &s;hells and corals higher up the Wolga, where the lands begin to be more mountain|ous, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e from an inundation of the globe, &s;o much the larger, and the more remote, as all the marine productions contained in the&s;e layers, are of a nature not to be found, either in the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, or in the Euxine; but only in the depths of the ocean.</P>
<P>After &s;aying thus much, it may naturally be a&s;ked, how the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, which acquires, from the rivers

con&s;tantly running into it, as much water as it is &s;up|po&s;ed to lo&s;e by evaporation, for no &s;en&s;ible reflux has been ob&s;erved in it for many years; how this &s;ea could have lo&s;t, at one time, &s;o great a body of water, as to leave dry a &s;pace of country, doubtle&s;s more than 15 fathoms higher than the actual bed of that &s;ea, and of &s;o va&s;t an extent as the plains of the de&s;arts from the Lower Don to the Jaik, thence to Lake Aral, and behind this lake to the Uralian mountains, which are a &s;outhern prolongation of the Moguld&s;harian moun|tains? If we admit <HI>Tournefort</HI>'s &s;uppo&s;ition, which he has rendered probable, namely, that the mountains of the Thracian Bo&s;phorus were in perfect contact, and formed a boundary, which divided the Euxine from the Mediterranean; &s;o that the former, which received into it &s;uch great rivers, as the Danube, the Dnie&s;ter, the Don, and the Kuban, was an immen&s;e lake, who&s;e le|vel was above that of the Mediterranean &s;ea, or the ocean; but by a rupture of this mighty dam, occa&s;ioned either by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive action of the waters, or by an earthquake, the waters of the Euxine, ru&s;hed into the Mediterranean &s;ea, to gain its level; and that the fir&s;t influx of this enormous torrent, was the rea&s;on of the&s;e inundations; which, according to the mo&s;t ancient re|cords of hi&s;tory, deluged a part of Greece, and the i&s;les of the Archipelago; we &s;hall be able not only to account for this diminution of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, but the vi&s;ible traces that &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t of the ancient elevation of the Ca&s;pian, will corroborate the opinion of <HI>Tournefort.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="291">It appears, that the ea&s;tern &s;teps, which &s;hews the traces of the retiring of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, has an open communication, by low di&s;tricts, with the Crimean &s;tep, and others, &s;ituated towards the Black Sea; which &s;teps, as far as I could learn, are of the &s;ame nature with this ea&s;tern &s;tep. And hence, if the level of the Black Sea was many fathoms higher, before the waters bur&s;t through the channel of Con&s;tantinople, than at pre&s;ent, to which, perhaps, the rivers which flowed in tho&s;e times, from wild, woody, and moi&s;ter di&s;tricts, might have much contributed; it is a plain probability, that the &s;teps of the Crimea, Kuman, Wolga and Jaik, and the low countries of Great Tartary, till we pa&s;s the lake Aral, has been one common &s;ea, which, by a narrow and &s;hallow &s;treight, who&s;e marks the river Manyt&s;ch exhibits, flowed round the northern angle of Mount Cauca&s;us, and formed, by the pre&s;ent Ca&s;pian and Black Seas, two va&s;t deep bays.

<P><PB N="284" REF="293">In vain is the objection, that travellers relate what they have ob&s;erved near Baku; that the &s;ea gained upon the land, and had already &s;wallowed up part of the town; for if we con&s;ider the phlogi&s;tic nature of the &s;oil in tho&s;e parts, we &s;hall find infinitely greater rea&s;on for admitting a &s;inking of the earth, and of the moun|tain, than an increa&s;e of the &s;ea, which could not any way be the ca&s;e; whil&s;t, on the contrary, a bare in&s;pection of all the countries that &s;urround the northern part of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, leaves no room for doubting that it has undergone a diminution, much more con&s;iderable than the Mediterranean, or any other known &s;ea; nay, it is highly pre&s;umable, that it is &s;till decrea&s;ing every day.

The ruins of this antient re&s;idence, extend to the length of no le&s;s than 29 miles, taking in all along the edge of the &s;tep; whil&s;t, in breadth, they are only three-quar|ters of a mile. The Tartars, however, relate, that
<PB N="288" REF="297">
as they proceed in the &s;tep of the Jaik, to the river of that name, they meet with numberle&s;s other ruins of &s;mall edifices, built of brick. We know, from hi&s;tory, that this capital of Grand Tartary, was de|&s;troyed, in 1462, by the great-duke <HI>Ivan Va&s;&s;illie|vit&s;ch,</HI> grandfather of the Czar of that name; and that, &s;ome years afterwards, it was razed to the very foun|dations, by the Nogayan Tartars. In the&s;e ruins, we can &s;carce pa&s;s ten &s;teps, without &s;tirring up a &s;er|pent; indeed, they are general all over this di&s;trict, who&s;e &s;oil is &s;alt and nitrous. Their hi&s;&s;ings are heard all round; but they are only harmle&s;s &s;nakes, and the black, aquatic &s;erpents.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whil&s;t I am on the &s;ubject of Mount Cauca&s;us, I will &s;ay &s;omething, from the authorities of Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Schloetzer</HI> and <HI>Gulden&s;tadt,</HI> of the &s;ettlements about this chain of mountains, which fills the &s;pace between the Ca&s;pian and the Euxine &s;eas, extending from the we&s;t, ea&s;twards; bordering on Per&s;ia, to the &s;outh, and on Ru&s;&s;ia, to the north. It is a territory which the Ru&s;&s;ians are now contending with the Turks for; and contains a greater diver&s;ity of nations and lan|guages than any other country, of the &s;ame extent, in the world. Here are Greeks, who&s;e ance&s;tors have dwelt here from the earlie&s;t periods of hi&s;tory; here are the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e Genoe&s;e who held po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, with &s;o much authority, on the &s;hores of the Euxine, about the 13th century: and here are al&s;o, Moravians, Per&s;ians, and various colonies of Tartars.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="298"><Q>According to the geographical de&s;cription of the&s;e countries, Georgia, and its provinces, occupies the &s;outhern &s;ide of Mount Cauca&s;us, the Kabardines (among whom the T&s;cherrke&s;&s;ians, commonly called the Circa&s;&s;ians, are a part) the &s;outhern, the Legui&s;tans and Troughmenians the ea&s;tern, and the mountaineers in &s;ubjection to Turkey, the we&s;tern &s;ide, that is to|wards the Euxine, or Black Sea, called the Crimea. According to my general plan, no notice &s;hould be taken of countries not under the protection of Ru&s;&s;ia; but as they lie &s;o contiguous, and the Ru&s;&s;ians claim this territory, it may not be improper to &s;ay &s;omething of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Troughmenians are the antient Turcomans, and occupy the ea&s;tern part of the &s;outh &s;ide of Cauca&s;us, from the we&s;tern &s;hore of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, as far as the province of Kaghetia in Georgia. Se|veral of them have their particular princes; and others are in &s;ubjection to their neighbours.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This tribe is unmixed; the people from whom they &s;prung, wander &s;till about, in their ancient country, on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Ca&s;pian; their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions extending to the lake Aral, and touching the frontiers of Per&s;ia on the &s;outh. It is now above 40 years &s;ince the hordes of this nation fell under the
<PB N="290" REF="299">
Kalmucks of Ayouh, and being then out of humour with the Per&s;ians, in 1743, they determined to put them&s;elves under the protection of Ru&s;&s;ia, to the number of 30,000 families; but the Per&s;ian Schah prevented them: however, a con&s;iderable number joined them&s;elves to the Tartars of Orenburgh, Ufa and A&s;trachan; but, at the time, a party of the Kal|muck horde, in 1770, fled into D&s;ungaria, the Troughmenians of the river Ural obtained their liberty by the &s;word, and are at pre&s;ent free &s;ubjects of Ru&s;&s;ia, leading a retired life, about the mouth of the Kuma. The reigning khans are brothers, and &s;altans; that is, &s;ons, and princes, of <HI>Nour Hali,</HI> khan of the Kirgue&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In their figure they re&s;emble the Tartars; are as well made, polite and brave; acting, like the Swi&s;s, in time of war, and entering into the &s;ervice of any neighbour that will take them; and, as they a&s;k no leave, they often fight again&s;t each other.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In &s;hort, the people of Cauca&s;us are but &s;o many different remains of many European and A&s;iatic people, which, by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of many generations, have acquired a great re&s;emblance to each other, in per&s;on, con&s;titution and character, which border very much on that of the Tartars, who predominate among them, though they are, in many re&s;pects dis|tingui&s;hable. Generally &s;peaking, the people of
<PB N="291" REF="300">
Cauca&s;us, are large, well-made, not corpulent, of a tawny complexion, &s;trong features, &s;mall no&s;e, &s;mall eyes, and lively, thin eye-brows, and their hair red or black. They are active, poli&s;hed, bold and re&s;olute, voluptuous, very o&s;tentatious in dre&s;s and fea&s;ts, generous, and given to di&s;&s;ipation, through pride; and, at the &s;ame time, &s;evere, unju&s;t, per|fidious, and addicted to rapine and revenge.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They &s;hew great attention to their women, who are well-made, more frank and open, and more agreeable than Tartar women in general. The Cir|ca&s;&s;ians enjoy, with ju&s;tice a preference, their beauty, vivacity, ea&s;e, and refinement of their manners; and the ju&s;tne&s;s of their ta&s;te, have rendered them famous. Red hair is thought &s;o great a beauty, that &s;uch as are not &s;o ble&s;&s;ed, colour their hair with red pomatum. The lan|guages &s;poken here are as various as the people; and we find &s;ome villages &s;o in&s;ulated, as to have a language of their own, not in the lea&s;t under&s;tood by tho&s;e of the next village. The&s;e languages are, however, &s;o guttural, &s;o har&s;h and di&s;&s;onant, that we have no letters to expre&s;s the &s;ounds by.</Q></P>
<P><Q>All the nations of Cauca&s;us, together, may be able to furni&s;h 100,000 cavalry; notwith&s;tanding, &s;ome of them would find it difficult to rai&s;e 50 men to march again&s;t an enemy. All the&s;e &s;ocieties together
<PB N="292" REF="301">
form a kind of irregular ari&s;tocracy, compo&s;ed of many &s;maller ones. Every chieftain looks on all the males of his territory, capable of bearing arms, as his &s;oldiers; each of whom is obliged to equip him|&s;elf, and attend his chief when called on. Some of the&s;e people &s;carce pay any tax, whil&s;t others give a fourth of what they po&s;&s;e&s;s; a tenth is the u&s;ual tri|bute, with a certain number of hor&s;es and cattle, ac|cording to the circum&s;tances of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Mer|chants, and arti&s;ans, furni&s;h different &s;orts of mer|chandi&s;e, ammunition, &amp;c. The admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice is conducted in the Turki&s;h manner; an ar|bitrary &s;entence is pronounced immediately, often without enquiry, and &s;ometimes without crime, or any proportion to the fault.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Many of the Cauca&s;ians lead a wandering life; but the chief part live in villages of from 20 to 50 hou&s;es. Each village has a &s;tone tower for defence, in ca&s;e of attack, in which women and children are &s;heltered from the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault. Their ordinary hou&s;es are but poor, wooden huts; and there are many fa|milies that dwell in jurts, or tents, of white felt. The man&s;ions of their princes and nobility, are built of wood, &s;ome few of &s;tone, all of them badly built, and badly furni&s;hed; and &s;urrounded by the tents and huts of their dome&s;tics and attendants, &s;ta|bles, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><PB REF="302"><Q>Agriculture and pa&s;turage are their principal oc|cupations, though &s;everal follow trades and com|merce. Some have plantations of cotton, and breed &s;ilk-worms. Vines grow on the&s;e mountains, without culture; but they turn their grapes to no account.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Cattle thrive abundantly with them; but their flocks are not numerous, their villages being too near each other. The hor&s;es of Cauca&s;us are little inferior to tho&s;e of Arabia, and one, if properly broke in, will fetch 100 ducats; for which rea&s;on, princes and nobles have fine &s;tuds. They are taught to under&s;tand and obey different words of com|mand, to kneel down for the rider to mount, di&s;|mount, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Be&s;ides the common trades, the&s;e people are ex|cellent workmen in iron. They make &s;abres, plain and dama&s;ked, and angular poignards, for piercing coats of mail at the joints, and to render the wounds they give mortal, they make them of ar&s;enical &s;teel: they make al&s;o all kinds of armour. They trade by barter; but take the coin of every country by its weight.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Some of the&s;e Circa&s;&s;ians are &s;o expert in &s;tealing cattle, and carrying off women, that they make a trade of it. Their principal endeavours are directed
<PB N="294" REF="303">
towards carrying off beautiful virgins, or hand&s;ome women. Such as they take, they keep as concu|bines, or &s;ell them to the Armenians, who &s;upply the Turki&s;h harams, making them pa&s;s for chri&s;tians, in order to enhance their value. What has been pub|li&s;hed on the &s;ubject, of this famous commerce with the Circa&s;&s;ian women, is undoubtedly exaggerated, though the fact is true. They al&s;o carry their child|ren to Kaffa market, with their cattle, where they obtain 7,000 Turki&s;h pia&s;tres for a young and hand|&s;ome girl. <HI>Kluman,</HI> of Vienna, one of the late&s;t tra|vellers of credit, in his Voyage to the Crimea, a&s;&s;erts the &s;ame thing. 'The&s;e female &s;laves, when brought to market, are locked up in a &s;mall pri|vate apartment. When there, &s;ays he, I was de&s;irous of &s;eeing &s;ome, and &s;poke to the &s;ale&s;man, for that purpo&s;e. One of them was, con&s;equently, brought out to me, into a room where I was waiting. She was well-dre&s;&s;ed, but her face was veiled; &s;he ki&s;&s;ed my hand, agreeable to the ea&s;tern cu&s;tom; and her ma&s;ter ordered her to walk to and fro. She was ele|gant to the extreme; when &s;he unveiled her face, &s;he ab&s;olutely enchanted me, &s;o inexpre&s;&s;ible was her beau|ty. Her hair was light, her eyes full and blue, her no&s;e a little long, her lips lovely, her features regular, her complexion white and &s;oft, and her cheeks tinged with a fine carmine; &s;he had a long neck, and a fine bo&s;om completed the charms of her per&s;on. She was de&s;ired to wipe her face with a white handkerchief,

to &s;hew me, her beauty was not owing to paint. She then &s;hewed her teeth, which were white and regular. I was allowed to feel her pul&s;e, in order to be con|vinced of her health. After this, &s;he was ordered to withdraw. The Armenian, who had the di&s;po&s;al of her, a&s;&s;ured me, &s;he was 18 years old, and yet an un&s;potted virgin. Her price was 4,000 pia&s;tres, or about 125&pound;. Engli&s;h; which, he &s;aid, was the value of &s;uch a &s;lave. Having viewed this girl, another was brought out to me, and underwent a &s;imilar ex|amination.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that none but the rich can make &s;uch purcha&s;es; &s;o that the&s;e victims to voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s, &s;tand a fair chance of being better provided for, than they would have been at home. This kind of traffic appears &s;hocking to tho&s;e of refined &s;enti|ments, who &s;eek, in marriage, for a faithful and in|&s;eparable companion, the equal &s;harer of their good or bad fortune; but, in other &s;ocieties, le&s;s civilized, we find they are con&s;idered in no other light, than as mini&s;tering to the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>All the Kobardines, and Circa&s;&s;ians of Cauca&s;us, when well dre&s;&s;ed, wear a &s;hirt of fine linen, large trow&s;ers, Morocco-leather boots, a long ca&s;&s;ock, tied by a &s;ilk &s;a&s;h, and a long upper garment, of fine cloth, or &s;ilk, with open &s;leeves, in the ea&s;tern &s;tile. They &s;have the head, and wear mu&s;tachios, and the beard
<PB N="296" REF="306">
pointed at the chin; the head covered with a &s;cull|cap, of &s;ome rich &s;tuff, and over that a cap flattened at top, and wider there than at bottom. They &s;el|dom go abroad without a poignard, and a &s;abre; the former in the &s;a&s;h, and the &s;abre in a leather belt. The poor wear cloth, or cotton &s;tuffs, of their own making.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The female dre&s;s is a &s;hift, trow&s;ers, a ve&s;t, and a gown, &s;ometimes with &s;leeves, and &s;ometimes with|out. In winter, they put on furs, reaching to the feet. They always wear ear-rings, and a necklace. The head is covered with a ta&s;tar, or Tartarean veil, which is brought over their faces, when they go abroad.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They eat, like the Tartars, but their viands are made more reli&s;hing. At meals, they &s;it on chairs, round a table, are very fond of &s;trong liquors, con|fining the interdiction of the Prophet to wine alone, for they are all Mahomedans. Their common drink is mead, and a kind of Engli&s;h ale, brewed by them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Polygamy is allowed among them; the fir&s;t wife having many more privileges than the &s;econd, or third: few, however, have more than one wife, and &s;he winks at her hu&s;band's intrigues. They are too proud to confe&s;s that they purcha&s;e their
<PB N="297" REF="307">
wives, but call the price paid, a nuptial pre&s;ent; which they will fix, however, with as much pre|ci&s;ion as a Tartar.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As to their funerals, they wrap up the dead in large winding-&s;heets, and bury them without a coffin. In different places, about Cauca&s;us, we meet with epi|taphs, cro&s;&s;es and in&s;criptions, which indicate them to have been made by chri&s;tians. Probably, the&s;e are the remains of the Greek empire, when the &s;eat of it was at Byzantium; or el&s;e of the colony of Moravians, who quitted their country about the end of the 15th century, to which they were expo&s;ed, and &s;ought an a&s;ylum here, though they are now en|tirely degenerated, and mixed with others, pre&s;erving only their name and language; or, they may be ve&s;tiges of the zeal of <HI>Ivan Va&s;&s;illievit&s;ch,</HI> the great Tzar of Ru&s;&s;ia, for the conver&s;ion of the Cau|ca&s;ians.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As I &s;hall, probably, have occa&s;ion to mention the Circa&s;&s;ians again, I will &s;ay no more of them here.</Q></P>
<P>On the 4th of Augu&s;t, continues Dr. Pallas, I made a tour up the Wolga, in order to vi&s;it the German co|lonies; and &s;aw, on the heights, along the road, a great number of water-melon gardens, in the open &s;tep, where this fruit grows very large and fine, without watering. The water-melons of Zarizyn, &s;urpa&s;s almo&s;t tho&s;e of
<PB N="298" REF="308">
A&s;trachan. The &s;ame high grounds, and many others, as far as Dubofka, are excellently &s;ituated for vine|yards; and the garden of Colonel <HI>Zipletof,</HI> governor of Zarizyn, which has been made but four years, is a proof of it; as it yields, annually, near 20 puds of fine grapes.</P>
<P>This garden was planted on the &s;pot where there was formerly a wild orchard, and is at pre&s;ent not only in|crea&s;ed, but prodigiou&s;ly improved. It contains va|rious &s;pecies of fruit-trees and vines, of Hungary and A&s;trachan. The upper corner of this garden exhibits a hand&s;ome flowers of Glauber's, which vi&s;ibly &s;pring from &s;ome invi&s;ible &s;ources; and the adjacent heights have, perhaps, the &s;ame vitriol layers, as are ob&s;erved upon the Et&s;henka.</P>
<P>This di&s;trict, between the upper and lower Met|&s;chetna, near the Wolga, is remarkable for the remains of an old Tartarean city, which has been almo&s;t levelled with the ground. Among the ruins, are the foun|dation of a great, &s;tone building, which has been either a caravan&s;era, or a mart. It is a large &s;quare, with &s;everal alleys, and divi&s;ions, like &s;mall chambers. Here are but few bricks among the rubbi&s;h, but great quan|tities of free-&s;tone. It is &s;aid, that on the &s;pot where the governor's villa &s;tands, was originally a met&s;ched; and that &s;everal valuable things, and &s;ome golden &s;ad|dle-plates, were dug up in the foundations. Probably
<PB N="299" REF="309">
the whole has been a &s;uburb of that Tartarean metro|polis, who&s;e remains are found a little lower down than Zarizyn, on the Achtuba.</P>
<P>At Dubofka, about 40 miles from the la&s;t place, is a fine &s;tone-built, &s;pacious man&s;ion, erected in the Gothic ta&s;te, formerly belonging to <HI>Ataman Por&s;izky,</HI> who lived to the age of 120: he founded this town. The proprietor did not live till it was quite fini&s;hed, and it now &s;tands wa&s;te, his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors liking rather to live in their wooden dwellings. The Co&s;&s;acks of Du|bofka were &s;elected, in the beginning of this century, from tho&s;e about the Don. At fir&s;t they con&s;i&s;ted of 1,017 heads, but at pre&s;ent they are reduced to 500; yet have &s;till their ataman-djak, &s;tarchines, and &s;tanix|atamans. They po&s;&s;e&s;s a great deal of horned cattle, and a great extent of arable land along the Wolga; and trade much towards the Don, in boards, re&s;in, brick, tar, timber, barges and waggons. They fix great ve&s;&s;els on rollers, and drag them to the place of &s;ale, with 15 or 20 yoke of oxen. In &s;ummer-time, many of them will leave their town, and travel to the upper di&s;tricts of the Wolga, through the Kama, with all &s;orts of materials for &s;hipping, in order to &s;ell them.</P>
<P>About 90 miles higher up, is the fortre&s;s Dmitre&s;s|kaja, or Kamy&s;chenka, lying in the lower angle, which the brook Kamy&s;chenka forms with the Wolga, in a
<PB N="300" REF="310">
low and moi&s;t &s;oil. The fir&s;t fortre&s;s erected here, in the la&s;t century, had a far more healthy and advan|tageous &s;ituation; the remains of which are &s;till to be &s;een, on a height in the neighbourhood. The pre&s;ent, new fortre&s;s is quite commanded by that height, and con&s;i&s;ts of a wooden wall and ba&s;tions, &amp;c. The works enclo&s;e a &s;tone-built cathedral, a well-built town-hou&s;e, the governor's man&s;ion, and &s;ome other dwellings of note. The city lies in length down the Wolga, in long, parallel &s;treets, of which the principal one con&s;i&s;ts of of moveable &s;hops, and extends from the fortre&s;s to the &s;alt-magazines. This city has al&s;o two, wooden churches. The &s;hop-keepers here &s;ell a great deal of provi&s;ions, and waggoner's-tools, on account of the &s;alt that is con|veyed through this place. Formerly a great trade was carried on here, with the Kalmucks, and would be now, if that canal was made from this river to the Don, which <HI>Peter the Great</HI> planned. I found here Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Lowiz,</HI> and his a&s;&s;i&s;tant, Mr. <HI>Inochodzof,</HI> employed in taking the level of the country, through which this road is to pa&s;s. It was begun in the reign of <HI>Peter the Great,</HI> by Captain <HI>Perry,</HI> an Engli&s;hman. The &s;oft nature of the high grounds, which &s;tand in the way, and the rivulets of Ilowla, to which this canal is to run, give the greate&s;t hopes to the execution of this project.</P>
<P>In order to reach the river Jeru&s;lan, or Ulu&s;tan, about 13 miles from the river Targun, we pa&s;&s;ed over the
<PB N="301" REF="311">
&s;tep of Targun, which is arid and barren to the extreme. The &s;lime which covers the &s;oil, becomes fine du&s;t in &s;ummer-time, ri&s;es in the air with the lea&s;t wind, and is very trouble&s;ome to travellers; add to this, the whole di&s;trict is very un&s;afe, on account of &s;everal gangs of Kirgue&s;e, who live by the plunder of incautious tra|vellers that fall in their way. The Jeru&s;ian runs pa|rallel with the Wolga, a con&s;iderable way; but, where the road leaves it, there is a umet, or way-hou&s;e, where they &s;ell bread and hay, and where there is a bridge, if the water is high. It is ju&s;t 75 miles from this place to Saratof, and as far to the lake. Some of our people carele&s;ly let &s;ome fire drop on the &s;tep, which kindled the parched gra&s;s, and the fire &s;pread with &s;uch ra|pidity and violence, as to become inextingui&s;hable, and we had a great deal of trouble, as before, to bring off the waggons through the fire, which had made a circle round us; &s;o that we were in danger of being burnt alive, or &s;uffocated by the vapours and &s;moke; yet we &s;aved every thing, and got off without any material damage.</P>
<P>Eleven miles from the Jeru&s;lan, we pitched our tents on the &s;ide of a brook, and took up our lodging for the night, on the 12th of Augu&s;t. From the heights &s;ituated about this brook, we could de&s;cry, we&s;tward, the high mountains of Selotof&s;k, beyond the Wolga; and as, in this di&s;trict, are &s;ituated the lowermo&s;t Ger|man colonies I intended to vi&s;it, we had the&s;e moun|tains
<PB N="302" REF="312">
for our land-mark, it being 23 miles to the neare&s;t colony, Kot&s;chetnaja.</P>
<P>This village, con&s;i&s;ting of 49 hou&s;es, mo&s;tly Roman-catholic families, from the bi&s;hopricks in Tran&s;ylvania, belongs to the circle of Warenburg, well colonized, under the direction of one <HI>Le Roi &amp; Pictel.</HI> The above circle contains 16 colonies, planted along the Wolga; of which the lowermo&s;t lies &s;ix miles fur|ther down the &s;aid river, and at 60 miles di&s;tance from Saratof. They have taken Ru&s;&s;ian names, and the people &s;peak the Ru&s;s language, with uncommon ea&s;e and purity. The&s;e 16 colonies con&s;i&s;t of 874 families, or 3,850 per&s;ons, from almo&s;t all parts of Germany; and are of different, and partly of mixed religions. They have, among&s;t them, one Lutheran mini&s;ter, and two Romi&s;h prie&s;ts. The hou&s;es, throughout all the colo|nies, are wood, and built on a new plan, &s;o as to unite two habitations under one roof. Each coloni&s;t has a good chamber, parlour and kitchen; and &s;ometimes a little clo&s;et be&s;ides. The&s;e villages are &s;ituated along the Wolga low-grounds, which &s;upply them with plenty of hay and wood; but they are too near each other, to afford them all a &s;ufficient quantity of good, arable land; and though they are rapidly increa&s;ing, they cannot pro&s;per well, unle&s;s &s;ome change is made, and they are &s;eparated farther from each other.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="313">All round Saratof, to the di&s;tance of 50 or 60 miles, along the banks of the Wolga and Karaman, there are a number of colonies, either erected by the Empre&s;s her&s;elf, or by the agents of <HI>Le Roi, Pictet,</HI> and the <HI>Baron de Beauregard,</HI> 85 in number, be&s;ides the 16 al|ready mentioned; compri&s;ing 5,125 families, and 20,162 per&s;ons, of different countries, Germans, Dutch, French, &amp;c. and different per&s;wa&s;ions, with Lutheran and Romi&s;h clergy; all properly e&s;tabli&s;hed, under cer|tain chiefs and regulations.</P>
<P>Between Saratof and A&s;trachan, there are &s;everal more colonies, pretty near each other, in which are manufactories of cloth, linen and &s;tuff. That of Ro&s;&s;o&s;|chi, con&s;i&s;ts only of French families, and belongs to 11 others, erected by Governor <HI>Bo&s;&s;e,</HI> and are imme|diately under the command of the Empre&s;s. The hou&s;es here are all built with &s;tone; but the inhabitants are dull and &s;lothful.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a Hol&s;tein colony, though mo&s;t of the inhabitants come from the Rheni&s;h countries. The Noah of the&s;e coloni&s;ts, or the per&s;on who fir&s;t intro|duced the plantation of vineyards, is one <HI>John Philip Peiler,</HI> from Me&s;&s;ingen upon the Rhine; he has, in two gardens belonging to him, upwards of 2,000 bear|ing vines, which yielded him, la&s;t year, more than 20 puds of grapes. He does not water his vines, though they &s;tand upon a very dry &s;oil. It mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to
<PB N="304" REF="314">
the &s;altne&s;s of the ground, that the grapes, though un|like tho&s;e of A&s;trachan, in &s;ize, beauty and ta&s;te, yields far better juice, which, if &s;uffered to &s;tand long in ca&s;ks, becomes a high, red, light wine, equal to &s;ome French wines, and a nectar compared with that of A&s;trachan.</P>
<P>That I might collect a proper account of the&s;e co|lonies, I went to the colony of Catherine&s;tadt, and &s;taid there a whole day. The plan of this place was pro|jected for 300 families (though it has only 163, con|&s;i&s;ting of 615 people); the chief part of whom &s;eem to be mechanics. Here is a fine Lutheran church, which has its own preacher; al&s;o, a Calvini&s;t and Romi&s;h chapel, but they have no mini&s;ters appointed to them: to the latter, a prie&s;t came, occa&s;ionally, to &s;ay ma&s;s. The dwellings are all built of wood, in regular &s;treets. No colony has better, mechanical profe&s;&s;ions than this, and &s;ome acquire a good living, by its being &s;o near Saratof, from which it is di&s;tant 39 miles. It has at pre&s;ent an uphol&s;terer, an able turner, &s;ome hatters, dyers, clothiers and weavers, carpenters, cutlers, lock|&s;miths, and watch-makers; and &s;ome of more common trades, as taylors, &s;hoe-makers, bakers, millers, butch|ers, &amp;c. even &s;ome miners came here, but finding no employ, they are turned hu&s;bandmen. If there was more bu&s;ine&s;s for the&s;e people, Catherine&s;tadt would &s;oon be a &s;ub&s;tantial place. Formerly, the planting of tobacco was the be&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the coloni&s;ts; and
<PB N="305" REF="315">
the Kalmuck hordes, who u&s;ed to pa&s;s this di&s;trict in &s;ummer, purcha&s;ed almo&s;t all they grew; but now this commerce is on the decline, though connoi&s;&s;eurs e&s;teem the tobacco rai&s;ed here, not inferior to that of Vir|ginia. In the di&s;trict of Catherine&s;tadt, there were more than 20 de&s;ettines of land planted with tobacco. They attempted here to plant mulberry-trees, but the young plants were entirely devoured in winter by the hares. An attempt has al&s;o been made, with &s;ucce&s;s, to make Dutch and Swi&s;s chee&s;e. But before I quit the&s;e colonies, I mu&s;t mention a kind of vinegar, pre|pared by the inhabitants of Catherine&s;tadt, from curds, for want of a &s;tronger acid. They take, for this pur|po&s;e, the curds of turned milk, put them into a little barrel, with the addition of leaven, or &s;our dough, or without, until they have fini&s;hed their fermentation, when they yield a very &s;trong and plea&s;ant vinegar.</P>
<P><HI>Saratof.</HI> From Catherine&s;tadt I went, on the 15th, to Saratof, and arrived there on the 18th of Augu&s;t. This city was fir&s;t &s;ituated on the left &s;ide of the Wolga, on the brook Saratofka, where the ve&s;tiges of it are to be &s;een. The pre&s;ent city was built about the end of the 16th century, and is now a con&s;iderable place, increa&s;ed, within the&s;e ten years, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the German colonies. It lies along the &s;teep bor|der of the Wolga, at the bottom of &s;ome high moun|tains, which form a chain along the Wolga, Ilawla, and Don. The place is divided by a deep cleft, and an
<PB N="306" REF="316">
old wall, into city and &s;uburbs. The low part of the city lies chiefly on level ground, has broad and regular &s;treets, &s;even churches, one convent of friars, and an|other of nuns. Here is al&s;o a court of waywodes, a &s;alt-office, a court of tuition which &s;uperintends the co|lonies, and a court of police.</P>
<P>The court of waywodes is a &s;tone building; and, oppo&s;ite to it, are &s;everal &s;tone-built comptoirs. The city has many &s;ub&s;tantial inhabitants; and &s;ome lords of adjacent manors, have here &s;ome fine man&s;ions. The great market is built of wood, and contains a great number of &s;hops. Among the inhabitants are about 100 German citizens, &s;ome of very lucrative trades. Three miles from the city, one <HI>Verdier</HI> has an exten&s;ive mulberry-plantation, but his &s;ucce&s;s in &s;ilk-worms has not been very con&s;iderable. Saratof receives great be|nefit from the &s;hips that are here moored, laden with hides, tallow, fi&s;h, &s;alt, and Per&s;ian goods, bound from A&s;trachan, and other lower di&s;tricts, to the upper parts of the empire, and returning from tho&s;e parts to A&s;tra|chan, with corn, wood, earthen and wooden ve&s;&s;els; and al&s;o, from the carts and waggons, thou&s;ands of which pa&s;s this town every week, e&s;pecially in winter, conveying &s;alt and fi&s;h to the ea&s;tern parts of the empire.</P>
<P>On the 24th of Augu&s;t, we went to the Elton &s;alt-lake, called, by the Kalmucks, <HI>Altan-nor</HI> (the golden
<PB N="307" REF="317">
lake), on account of its red lu&s;tre under the &s;un. The &s;alt, in this lake, is dug by volunteer workmen, who come here in &s;pring, and work the whole &s;ummer. This year there were employed only 550 men; but other years they have &s;eldom been le&s;s in number than 1,768; at times, 4,000 have been employed.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, the lake was very &s;hallow, and digging of the &s;alt very difficult. They broke it, at two miles from the borders; and even there the water was not more than three quarters of a yard deep: the &s;alt-rinds are broke with heavy bars, &s;imilar to tho&s;e u&s;ed in Ru&s;&s;ia, to break the ice in rivers. Having broke it into &s;mall pieces, they wa&s;h off the &s;lime with the &s;alt-water, and then carry it on &s;hore, to a place enclo&s;ed with pales. Each &s;et of &s;alt-breakers &s;ell the &s;alt they dig to the &s;alt-conveyers, dear or cheap, according to the nature of circum&s;tances. Formerly, when there were many workmen, and the work was ea&s;ier, the &s;alt-conveyers paid them for a waggon-load, drawn by two bullocks, which carries about 120 puds, from 25 to 30 copecs only; but, during the pre&s;ent year, the price ro&s;e to 50 or 60 copecs. The waggoners, or conveyers, when arrived at the mart, get the carriage paid by the pud. The di&s;tance from the lake to Saratof, is com|puted to be 135 miles, and the carriage is generally &s;ix copecs, or three-halfpence per pud, or 36lb.; but the di&s;tance to Dmitre&s;skoi, being only 85 miles, the car|riage is only four copecs per pud. From this &s;um, they
<PB N="308" REF="318">
deduct one denu&s;chka, for the repair of bridges, and fre&s;h-water wells. A waggon cannot go more than five or &s;ix journeys in a &s;ummer, to Saratof; and does not get more, for each load, with two bullocks, than be|tween &s;even and eight rubles; therefore, the more bea&s;ts of draught a waggoner has, the better. A &s;alt-dew very frequently falls about this lake; I found it on the 23d of Augu&s;t, in the morning, upon the reeds, in a kind of milky drops, very &s;alt to the ta&s;te. It has been ob&s;erved, that the &s;eeds of water-melons, expo&s;ed one night to this dew, will never grow. The borders of the lake, are full of all &s;orts of &s;alt-plants.</P>
<P>On the 25th of Augu&s;t, we had to travel over a parched &s;tep, where no fre&s;h water was to be had; it was more than 38 miles over. Our hor&s;es were &s;o &s;pent, that they could &s;carce lift their feet; and though we were within &s;ight of the Wolga, one of our hor&s;es fell from thir&s;t, and died the next morning, though im|mediately after he fell, it rained a heavy &s;hower, which would have relieved him. When we reached the river, we were told, by &s;ome fi&s;hermen, that we were within &s;even miles of Dubofka, from which the lake Elton lies directly we&s;t. The next morning, the 27th, we rode to Dubofka, but found the commander of the Co&s;&s;acks &s;o drunk, that we were obliged to wait till the next day, for hor&s;es to convey us on to Zarizyn.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="319"><HI>Zarizyn.</HI> As I pa&s;&s;ed the following winter in Za|rizyn, where I met with Mr. <HI>Georgi,</HI> I will give my readers &s;ome account of this city, the di&s;trict, the weather, and its natural productions.</P>
<P>Next to A&s;trachan, Zarizyn is the mo&s;t ancient, in|habited and fortified place in the lower di&s;trict of the Wolga. It lies ju&s;t beyond the mouth of the brook Zariza, on the right-hand bank of the Wolga. The town belongs to the government of A&s;trachan, is 278 miles from it, and lies in the latitude of 48&deg; 20 min. N. latitude. As there is no circle dependent on Zarizyn, it has only a commandant's chancery. The fortre&s;s is an antique &s;tructure, and con&s;i&s;ts of a high rampart and ba&s;tions, The works, decayed by age, were lately repaired by the Turki&s;h pri&s;oners of war; and it was &s;o well done, that, in 1774, when a numerous body of rebellious pea&s;ants, under <HI>Pugat&s;chef,</HI> attempt|ed an attack on this place, they found them&s;elves ob|liged to rai&s;e the &s;iege, without injuring the fortre&s;s at all. The heavy cannon in the place were of the greate&s;t &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The buildings within the fort are mean. There are but few, good dwelling-hou&s;es; every thing in the city being built of wood, except the three churches. The market-place is exten&s;ive, has many &s;hops, and here live many &s;ub&s;tantial merchants, who carry on a great trade with the Kalmucks, and the numerous travellers
<PB N="310" REF="320">
that pa&s;s this way. The &s;maller number of the inha|bitants live by breeding of cattle, and rai&s;ing cucum|bers, melons, and water-melons; al&s;o, by fi&s;hing, and carrying goods from place to place. Good trades are very much wanting; and, of cour&s;e, this is a great advantage to the neighbouring colony of Sarepta. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of a batallion of light-hor&s;e. The commander of the fortre&s;s was formerly the chief of the citizens, and the whole di&s;trict; but, in 1773, the Empre&s;s e&s;tabli&s;hed a court of waywodes.</P>
<P>Quitting the fortre&s;s, there is a &s;uburb belonging to this place, inhabited by Co&s;&s;acks. It is irregularly built, but has a &s;tone church, lately erected; it was found nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et fire to the place, when threat|ened with an attack by <HI>Pugat&s;chef</HI>'s party. The Zari|zinian line, or boundary, con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;trong wall, on the &s;outh &s;ide, with palli&s;adoes, beginning near the fortre&s;s, and continuing uninterrupted as far as the river Don, which lies at the di&s;tance of 45 miles from the Wolga. On this line are four redoubts; and be|tween the&s;e, at proper di&s;tances, a guard-hou&s;e, en|compa&s;&s;ed with chevaux-de-frize. The whole is guarded by Co&s;&s;acks of the Don, who receive a pay of 12 rubles a year: and commanded by the governor of Zarizyn.</P>
<P>"Six hundred Co&s;&s;acks of the Don," &s;ays <HI>Gmelin,</HI> who was there in 1769, <Q>quartered at Zarizyn, are
<PB N="311" REF="321">
di&s;patched regularly every year, in conjunction with &s;ome regular troops, to guard this line. At &s;uch guard-hou&s;e, 24 Co&s;&s;acks, commanded by a &s;otnik, are lodged in mi&s;erable, &s;ubterranean barracks. The&s;e po&s;ts are only relieved every four months; and the &s;ervice of the line, la&s;ts for one or two years.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Their advanced po&s;ts are likewi&s;e charged with furni&s;hing travellers, that have pa&s;sports, with relays; and, when they go in boats belonging to the Crown, the Co&s;&s;acks are obliged to perform the office of rowers. If the reader could picture to him&s;elf, the idea of the mo&s;t wretched of the human &s;pecies, he would form that of a Co&s;&s;ack, employed in the lines of Zarizyn. None are &s;ent there but the poore&s;t and mo&s;t deplorable of all their race; and &s;uch as have no condition in life, and, de&s;titute, of either friends or money, have no means of avoiding this painful &s;ervice. From the in&s;tant they arrive, their treatment is &s;uch as a pitile&s;s and unfeeling pea&s;ant would &s;carce &s;hew to his bea&s;t. Though the un|happy Co&s;&s;ack can &s;carcely obtain a &s;mall allow|ance of bread, very hard and very black, to a&s;&s;wage his hunger, he mu&s;t yet endure all the extremity of heat, and &s;everity of cold, with no other covering than the few rags he brought with him; or &s;hut him|&s;elf up, in &s;ome cavern of the earth, with the com|panions of his wretchedne&s;s, where it would be im|po&s;&s;ible

for any man, not trained to hard&s;hip, and accu&s;tomed to di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituations from his birth, to exi&s;t for one minute, and brave the putridity of the air. As to his hor&s;e, or two hor&s;es, which is all his property, they mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with much le&s;s pro|vender than the unhappy ma&s;ter can allow them for performing the harra&s;&s;ing &s;ervice of his landlord, to whom every hor&s;e of the Co&s;&s;acks is bound. When the term of this &s;lavery is expired, he goes home with his &s;tarved bea&s;ts, if, perchance, he has been happy enough to pre&s;erve their lives, with his own, in a poorer plight than he went away. If, among the number of the&s;e poor wretches, &s;ome &s;hould be di&s;|covered to have a &s;mall matter of money about them, the fate of &s;uch as are pennyle&s;s is perhaps le&s;s to be pitied, for the money is &s;ure to increa&s;e the re|venues of the officers of Zarizyn; and it is well known, that every Co&s;&s;ack who has any coin, how|ever &s;mall in value, commonly di&s;appears before the expiration of his term. Their difficult &s;ervice as rowers, may be collected from what Mr. <HI>Gmelin</HI> further relates: He &s;ays, That when his two companions got into one of the government-boats, on the 20th of September, and had only proceeded a few miles on the Wolga, there aro&s;e &s;o furious a tempe&s;t from the we&s;t, that the waves went over the ve&s;&s;el, and the boatmen, un&s;kil|ful in their bu&s;ine&s;s, knew not how to get forwards. Whil&s;t they were in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s imaginable; they &s;truck, perhaps to the &s;aving of their lives, on a

<P>This di&s;trict enjoys plenty of every thing, and &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es the whole country, farther down the Wolga. It is not only excellent, as has been before ob&s;erved, for the culture of water-melons, but for all &s;orts of fine fruits. Here grow wild many productions, not to be met with higher up the Wolga, and in other parts of Ru&s;&s;ia. Wild pears are in great plenty near Dubofka; mulberry-trees abound in the low grounds of the Ach|tuba; tamari&s;ks begin to grow near Zarizyn; and wild plums are abundant towards the Manty&s;ch, and the river Kuma. I &s;owed, in a water-melon garden near Zarizyn, &s;ome &s;eeds of <HI>pha&s;eolus,</HI> which I received from China, and which in Sweden will not grow but in the warme&s;t hot-hou&s;es; and they yielded, in Augu&s;t, the fine&s;t blo&s;&s;oms and &s;eed.</P>
<P>The weather of this country is as follows. Heavy fro&s;ts generally in January, which lower the mercury to 180&deg;, and to 200&deg;, equal to 13&deg; and 23&deg;, below the freezing-point of <HI>Rheaumur</HI>'s, thermometer. When
<PB N="314" REF="324">
at 200&deg;, the weather is &s;tormy, and the fro&s;t le&s;s &s;en|&s;ible. February is variable; has calm fro&s;ts, &s;ome|times &s;tormy from N. W. attended with &s;now, and ends with a thawing wind from W. S. W. In 1774, I was able to ob&s;erve the whole winter, and February was ex|ceedingly delightful and &s;weet. About the middle of the month, arrived little birds of pa&s;&s;age; and, towards the end, &s;wans, ducks, and other water-fowl. Febru|ary the 25th, the Wolga was freed from ice: the &s;ame day we had thunder; but, on the 28th, to the 11th of March, we had &s;uch continued, &s;harp cold, as froze the river again. The month of April is inconte&s;tibly, in this climate, the mo&s;t &s;ettled and fine&s;t of all months. No rain falls, but the rivers overflow, and water the land. At this time the water-melons are &s;own, and the wind, which blows con&s;tantly from one di&s;trict, viz. the ea&s;t, mitigates the heat. During the latter days of April (in 1774, on the 18th of April), or the mid|dle of May, the wind changes to the &s;outh, or &s;outh-we&s;t, and brings thunder and warm, nightly rains. This fine weather la&s;ts generally three or four weeks, when the wind changes to &s;outh, and &s;outh-ea&s;t: then begins the dry weather, which continues ten or twelve weeks. In June it is more &s;upportable; as, during the time when the water &s;tands high in the Wolga, which is al|ways highe&s;t this month, the night-dews are mo&s;t co|pious, and refre&s;h the earth exceedingly. The re&s;t of this month is generally &s;o &s;erene, that &s;carce a cloud, the &s;ize of a man's hand, is to be &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="325">The hotte&s;t and mo&s;t intolerable of all the &s;ummer-months, is July, when it blows con&s;tantly from the arid &s;tep and &s;ea, S. S. E. or E. After this ari&s;e the hot winds, which, though they blow irre&s;i&s;tibly, &s;o as to &s;weep off all the du&s;t from the &s;tep, and carry it through the air, are yet as hot as if they came from a fiery fur|nace. The&s;e winds u&s;ually commence about two in the afternoon, and continue till pa&s;t midnight; they &s;el|dom la&s;t longer. During their blowing, &s;heep often drop down dead, like flies, froth, bleed at the mouth, or &s;well, and become &s;o &s;uddenly puffed, that even their &s;kins are of no u&s;e. This hot, glowing wind is often owing to the burning of the &s;tep, and is then of longer duration. In July, 1774, the mercury ro&s;e as high, in the &s;un, as 60&deg;, in <HI>De Li&s;le</HI>'s thermometer, this is to 56 in <HI>Rheaumur</HI>'s; and a thermometer-gla&s;s, filled with &s;pirit of wine, bur&s;t. In the river Sarpa, &s;o great a number of fi&s;h and crabs died, that the &s;tench was intolerable. Soon after, it was known that this in&s;upportable hear, had ri&s;en from the burning of the Kumanian &s;tep, which was &s;et on fire, to the circum|ference of &s;everal hundred wer&s;ts, each wer&s;t three-quarters of an Engli&s;h mile: great numbers of people fell &s;ick by it. At other times, however, it is not un|common to &s;ee the quick&s;ilver, in the thermometer, ri&s;e, in this month, in the &s;hade, up to 90 and above (above 27.&deg; in the thermometer of <HI>Rheaumur</HI> higher than the heat of Pondicherry); and it was ob&s;erved by Dr. <HI>Wier</HI> at Sarepta (for it is from him I had this information),
<PB N="316" REF="326">
to ri&s;e in the &s;un, in 1773, on the 18th of July, and the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, to 75&deg;; and, on the 28th of July, in the &s;ame year, to 74&deg;; and, in 1767, it was &s;een, on the 12th of July, to ri&s;e all at once to 60&deg;. The air, during the &s;ultrine&s;s of July, is generally &s;o thick, that we cannot &s;ee far before us on the even &s;tep, though we imagine, by optic error, that we &s;ee a great way. This error, or deception, is produced by certain, undulating vapours vi&s;ible to the eye, ari&s;ing on the &s;tep, hills and high gra&s;s, and giving the appearance of di&s;tant, high mountains and woods, and repre&s;enting all objects larg|er than they are. <HI>Shaw, Niebar,</HI> and other oriental travellers, tell us that, in the great de&s;arts of Arabia, trembling vapours will ob&s;cure the horizon, and lead the eye to &s;uppo&s;e every thing at a di&s;tance to be larger than it is. In the di&s;trict of Zarizyn, during this &s;ultry month, it often appears from far, as if we &s;aw a hill encompa&s;&s;ed with water, when we have only an arid &s;tep in view. The beginning of this month ripens the water-melons; and the latter half of it, the grapes.</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t, thunders are frequent, ari&s;ing from S. and S. W. drawing northwards over the Wolga, and fall|ing away about the &s;ea, ea&s;twards; &s;o that they de&s;cribe a &s;emi-circle. Sometimes, they are accompanied by &s;o violent a hail and rain, as to cau&s;e inundations: &s;ome|times, &s;uch tempe&s;tuous whirlwinds ri&s;e as rai&s;e the du&s;t from the blo&s;&s;oms of the &s;everal &s;pecies of wormwood,

<P>September is generally &s;erene, clear and temperate; the wind changing to S. S. E. and N. E. October re|mains always temperate, the winds blowing from N.

In November, which they here call the rain-month, in temperate years, the rains change, towards the end, into north-ea&s;tern &s;torms, and &s;now. Fro&s;t and &s;torms often prevail, even in the beginning of this month, and the Wolga &s;oon drives ice. In 1773, the thermometer fell, on the 5th, to 190 degrees; and, in the night of the 13th and 14th, the ice became quite fixed.</P>
<P>When the year is mild, the Wolga is not frozen till December; then after a driving of ice, for a week or a fortnight, an ea&s;t wind, falls in, and fixes it. During this month reign continual &s;torms, with flakes of &s;now, that continue &s;ix or &s;even days.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="328">December and January can be called only, in ge|neral, the winter-months of this di&s;trict; and they are often &s;o mild, that ducks will remain the whole winter in the open water-&s;pots beyond Zarizyn. Larks, and partridges, will not leave the place, but to go to &s;uch &s;alt-&s;pots as are not covered with &s;now, where they can feed on the &s;eeds of plants. Partridges, which gather here in greate&s;t quantities in September and October, are caught, in the &s;aid months, in nets, and till December.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as a violent fro&s;t begins in November, the &s;now larks come into this di&s;trict, as the la&s;t birds of pa&s;&s;age from the northern zone, and re&s;ide, during the whole winter, in the lowe&s;t Wolga, among the field, and tuft, or cre&s;ted larks. The black &s;tep-larks <HI>(Alauda Tartarica),</HI> come from the &s;tep, when the &s;now and winter &s;torms rage, and take up their re|&s;idence in the vicinage of villages, but never leave the di&s;trict.</P>
<P>Other &s;mall birds of pa&s;&s;age, that &s;pend the winter in remote countries, come here in September, re|main whil&s;t the weather continues mild, and grow fat, by feeding on the &s;eeds of plants. The northern duck <HI>(An&s;er Erythropus),</HI> arrives, at the end of September, in large flocks; and, after a &s;hort &s;tay, draws away &s;outhwards.

<HI>(Charadrius gregarius),</HI> hie to their winter-abodes about the end of Augu&s;t. "In September," &s;ays <HI>Gmelin,</HI> <Q>the bee-bird <HI>(Merops apia&s;ter),</HI> pa&s;&s;es, by thou&s;ands, into other countries. We may judge of the quantity, by the number of their ne&s;ts. This bird builds in the clay, hence it is that the hills which ri&s;e one above another, along the we&s;tern bank of the Wolga, from Zarizyn, are &s;tuck as thick with them as the cells in a bee-hive.</Q></P>
<P>In &s;pring, the birds of pa&s;&s;age begin to &s;warm here, in the middle of February. In the beginning of this month, &s;now-larks, and &s;now-ortolans, draw abun|dantly to the north. About the 25th, one &s;ees, in the Sarpa and Achtuba, every &s;pecies of &s;wan, and the fir&s;t wild gee&s;e; and the dry ru&s;hes are plentifully crowded with tom-tits <HI>(Parus biarmicus et coeruleus).</HI> At the end of the month, the &s;teps are every where on fire.</P>
<P>When the month of March has fro&s;t, as it had in this year, the birds of pa&s;&s;age hide them&s;elves. This was the &s;ea&s;on in which during the pre&s;ent year, the wagtail, and black and white rock-nightingale, did not appear, till the 28th. On the 3d of April arrived the fir&s;t &s;wallows; and, about the &s;ame time, the in&s;ects bur&s;t into life, notwith&s;tanding a cold ea&s;t-wind blew very &s;harply.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="330">Between the 6th and 10th of April, we &s;aw, about the Sarpa, whole flocks of the <HI>An&s;er pulchricollis,</HI> or red-necked gee&s;e; but the&s;e left the di&s;trict very &s;oon. Next we &s;aw, for the fir&s;t time, the male of the bull-finch, <HI>fringilla <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lebs,</HI> with the linnet, <HI>fringilla petronia;</HI> and, afterwards, the woodcock, and great numbers of various other &s;pecies of birds of pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>This &s;hews how early the birds of pa&s;&s;age arrive in this di&s;trict; and, of cour&s;e, the warmth of the climate. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Wolga, are a great many &s;aigaks and antelopes, which draw northwards in win|ter; al&s;o, little mountain-foxes, or kor&s;aks. There is plenty of common, red foxes in the heights, between the Wolga and Don; and a great many hares, which re|main al&s;o grey during the winter. Wherever there are any roots, there are found the great blind mole, and the le&s;&s;er mole. Common ermines and wea&s;els, are here in plenty; and, where oaks and hazels grow, the field-mou&s;e, <HI>Quercinus;</HI> al&s;o, a great number of race, or jumping-hares, with three toes.</P>
<P>Of in&s;ects, they have the &s;corpion-&s;pider; but the pain, and ill effects of its bite, are &s;oon relieved by the application of oil. They have, al&s;o, a very large kind of millepedes, or <HI>&s;colo pendia;</HI> and fleas engender to &s;uch an enormous degree, that all the flocks and herds, and half the human race, would not &s;uffice to furni&s;h them with room. If a man &s;tops a while, in &s;ummer,
<PB N="321" REF="331">
on the low grounds about the Wolga, and in the hou&s;es, he immediately &s;warms with the&s;e vermin; and they fa&s;ten to the no&s;es of the unhappy hor&s;es, in &s;uch va&s;t quantities, that they &s;eem all black. Other dome&s;tic in&s;ects, as crickets and moths, are here, as in other places; and the <HI>Blatta A&s;iatica,</HI> or little moth of Chi|na, which begins to be general, extends from A&s;tra|chan to the towns above, and will, it is feared, be &s;hortly trouble&s;ome to all Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>There are a number of chalybeate &s;prings about Za|rizyn, &s;ome of which are much frequented by the in|habitants, on account of their cooling quality and promoting urine; but, by the u&s;e of them, I and my company had all our teeth loo&s;ened.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict of Zarizyn is richer in plants than all the &s;tep below; but yet only in vernal plants; for, in May, all the gra&s;s and herbs on the hills, begin to wither; and, in the two en&s;uing, &s;ummer-months every vegetable production is burnt up. <Q>Our author enumerates all the&s;e plants; but I have omitted them, as they would only &s;well the work, and be no enter|tainment to a general reader.</Q> They have a good deal of wild a&s;paragus, very fine, and good-flavoured. The natives, who are not Ru&s;&s;ians, are very fond of it; but the Ru&s;&s;ians never notice it. Very fine tulips, of different &s;pecies, grow wild in the &s;tep; and boys &s;earch for, and get their bulbous roots, with avidity.
<PB N="322" REF="332">
I mu&s;t ob&s;erve here, that the elm of this country <HI>(Ulma campe&s;tris),</HI> has a purgative quality. Water, in which the gummy leaves, gathered in &s;ummer, or autumn, have been &s;ome time &s;teeped, if drank, will open the body, like manna.</P>
<P>The &s;ilk-manufactory, belonging to the Crown, is one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful e&s;tabli&s;hments in this neighbourhood. Mulberry-trees <HI>(Morus Tartarica),</HI> grow in &s;uch quan|tities, that there are whole fore&s;ts of them, mixed with other trees. The&s;e &s;upply the &s;ilk-worm; the only in|convenience is, that at the time the chry&s;alis bur&s;ts, and the worm is in want of food, the rivers here over|flow the country, and they are obliged to gather the leaves in boats. No one can remember the planting of the&s;e trees; but the ruins of &s;tone-edifices, all over the &s;tep, render it ea&s;y to conjecture, that they were planted by tho&s;e Tartars, who formerly inhabited the&s;e de&s;arts, and who&s;e tribe was known by the name of the Golden Horde.</P>
<P>It was now the 24th of April, and, notwith&s;tanding the frequent robberies committed in the wild &s;tep by the Kirgue&s;e, which rendered the di&s;trict of the Wolga un&s;afe, all the la&s;t winter, I determined to make a tour along the Achtuba. The fruit of the wild mulberry, which grows along this river, is little inferior to that which grows in gardens. It ripens in the month of June, and may then be gathered, in large quantities;
<PB N="323" REF="333">
and its juice has been found, by fermentation, to yield a very &s;trong &s;pirit, which has nearly the &s;mell of Hun|gary water. The Achtuba had not yet received the waters of the overflowing Wolga; and it was &s;o &s;hallow, that we could cro&s;s it without wetting the axle-trees of our waggons. Mulberry-trees grew along the banks of this river, to the di&s;tance of 15 miles; and Coun|&s;ellor <HI>Ryt&s;chkof</HI> has e&s;tabli&s;hed here a very flouri&s;hing &s;ilk-manufactory.</P>
<P>Towards night I reached Ni&s;hnoi-Achtubin&s;koi-Go|rodok, which con&s;i&s;ts of two villages of that name, celebrated for their &s;ilk-manufactories. On the 25th, I travelled down the Achtuba, with an e&s;cort of 20 Co&s;&s;acks from the Don.</P>
<P>On the 28th, we went partly over &s;and-hills, partly through vallies, to the Salt-lake, and the mountain Bogdo; and though we travelled with the &s;ame hor&s;es, they &s;eemed quite fre&s;h and in &s;pirits, even after a diffi|cult and heavy journey of &s;everal days. One of our &s;uite, who accompanied the la&s;t waggon, met with a fall, and was &s;o much brui&s;ed, that he died four days after, in &s;trong convul&s;ions; and the weather being warm, I ordered his interment on the &s;tep.</P>
<P>This remarkable mountain, Bogdo Oata, as the Kal|mucks call it, (<HI>Bogdo</HI> implying, royal, or &s;ublime) has a high eminence, which, at a di&s;tance, the Kalmucks
<PB N="324" REF="334">
compare to a lion <HI>couchant,</HI> and, from this, &s;ometimes; called it, <HI>Ar&s;lan ula,</HI> or, lion's mountain. It's &s;trata may be ea&s;ily counted from its top, which has about 50 or 55 fathoms perpendicular height. The lime|&s;tone &s;tratum, at top is grey and hard, and breaks away in great &s;tones, full of petrifactions of &s;hell-fi&s;h. Under this lime, it mo&s;tly con&s;i&s;ts of loam, mixed with marle, or &s;and, 22 fathoms deep; and its top layers are much impregnated with common &s;alt. The drains have, in &s;everal places, deeply excavated the loam, and formed many, &s;ubterranean holes; &s;o that, as I was climbing up the &s;ide, the ground &s;unk under me, and I fell into a pit, up to my arms. Into the&s;e holes, the Kalmucks are accu&s;tomed to throw coin, cloaths, arms, &amp;c. as gifts, or offerings. The cleft, generally fed thus &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly, is &s;aid to have broke in a little before the Kalmuck horde left this di&s;trict; and was filled with water, to the depth of &s;everal fathoms; but, at pre&s;ent, there are no &s;igns of it. On the loam layers, is often found felenites, and pieces of common &s;alt, as pure as cry&s;tal, and as large as a man's fi&s;t. The ea&s;tern &s;helf of the mountain has a very pe|culiar appearance. Owing to the tenderne&s;s of the &s;and-&s;tone, probably, &s;everal little round holes, and grottos, have been formed, by the rapid da&s;hing of the billows, whil&s;t this &s;tep was covered by the &s;ea, for the&s;e excavations are not to be &s;een to the whole height of the &s;helf; and, on its level, towards the &s;alt-lake, lay al&s;o &s;ome brui&s;ed rocks, &s;cattered, which appear to
<PB N="325" REF="335">
have been wholly covered by the water; and near them we find, rolled balls, of different &s;izes, which, if beaten to pieces, are partly hollow, and contain &s;and. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, and the mountain being entirely in&s;ulated, and full of petrified bodies, that could have lived no where but at the bottom of the &s;ea, it is evi|dent, pa&s;t a doubt, that what is now land, was for|merly covered with water. If ea&s;t-winds blow violently again&s;t the grotto-work of this &s;helf, to one that &s;tands at the top, a noi&s;e is heard, &s;eemingly the di&s;tant mut|tering of many hundred people, with various voices, &s;ounding more or le&s;s at different times. I ob&s;erved this plainly to-day, as a violent ea&s;t-wind blew. The prie&s;ts of the Kalmucks told the people, that the wi&s;e, old man, <HI>Zaghan Ebughan,</HI> or &s;pirit of the mountain, has his re&s;idence beneath it, where there is an a&s;&s;embly of the ble&s;&s;ed, who are con&s;tantly praying, and &s;inging hymns.</P>
<P>Underneath the &s;and-&s;tone, is a high-red &s;trong-co|loured bole, encompa&s;&s;ing a &s;and-&s;late. The &s;uper|&s;titious Kalmucks fetch this bole, con&s;idering it as the mo&s;t &s;acred colour, and paint their tents with it. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the mountain, is a field of ala|ba&s;ter, with gyp&s;eous rocks, and a number of holes, &s;unk by the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age of &s;now-waters. On the highe&s;t part of the mountain, where it con&s;i&s;ts of &s;and-rocks, the Kalmucks have erected monuments, con&s;i&s;ting of high, &s;quare, &s;tone-pillars, which may be
<PB N="326" REF="336">
&s;een at a great di&s;tance. Otherwi&s;e, we &s;ee here, but very few traces of their &s;uper&s;tition; and I examined the whole of the mountain very particularly. But four miles and a half from it, towards the Wolga, is an old Kalmuck altar, erected of reeds and earth, the remains of a fe&s;tival there celebrated.</P>
<P>The Tartars have the mo&s;t extravagant notions re&s;|pecting this mountain; and, among others, &s;ay, that Bogda &s;tood originally on the &s;ide of the Jaik; but that two Kalmuck &s;aints took it into their heads to remove it to the banks of the Wolga. However, pre|vious to their undertaking this painful work, they pa&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable time in fa&s;ting and prayer: this rather weakened them, but they &s;oon got it on their &s;houlders, and, when they had brought it as far as where it now &s;tands, a &s;inful thought came into the mind of one of them (other traditions &s;ay, that he fell in love with a Kalmuck woman, and had carnal know|ledge of her), which &s;o enfeebled him, that he could no longer bear the weight, which fell on him, and cru&s;hed him to death; and, that his blood being &s;hed on the ground, produced that red colour, vi&s;ible in the mountain. As the other was not able to carry it alone, it has &s;tood where it fell.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of this &s;ingle &s;trata-mountain, though peculiarly remarkable, has yet, within a quarter of a mile of it, a no le&s;s remarkable object; viz. an inex|hau&s;tible
<PB N="327" REF="337">
&s;alt-lake, called <HI>Bogdoin Daba&s;&s;u.</HI> Its form is oblong, from we&s;t to ea&s;t, and 12 miles long; towards the we&s;tern bay, its breadth is about five miles, and its circumference thirty miles. Its di&s;tance from the next place, on the Achtuba, in a direct line, which is to the lower Pri&s;tan, or &s;alt-lake, is reckoned twenty-eight miles; and to the fortre&s;s T&s;chernojar&s;kaja, over all the arms of the Wolga, 32 miles. Carriages, drawn by oxen, go and return in five days; and, drawn by hor&s;es, in three days. The we&s;tern, wide part, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the mountain, forms a &s;mall bay, ending in a wide, round bay, which the &s;alt-diggers call <HI>Kultuk,</HI> or &s;ea-gulph. Beneath the high border of the lake, near the mountain, are &s;everal little bitter and fre&s;h-water &s;prings, overgrown with reeds. The whole lake is very &s;hallow; &s;o that, even when the wind blows and rai&s;es billows on the &s;hore, any man may cro&s;s it, and not be up to his wai&s;t. Standing near it, in the &s;un-&s;hine, it has a fine, greeni&s;h colour; but, at a di&s;tance, glitters with a &s;ilvery white. The water is exceedingly pure, without any bitterne&s;s; and even about the &s;prings, it has no bad &s;mell. The bottom is a &s;andy &s;lime, which &s;inks in, here and there, but annually covered with &s;alt-rinds, or cru&s;ts, as white as &s;now, being a &s;ediment from the water. The &s;alt, &s;ettled this year, was not yet become firm; it was, however, an inch thick, very pure, white, without &s;mell, or any mixture of bitter &s;alt; and, con&s;equently, far better than that of the lake Elton. By autumn, the year's cru&s;t is &s;aid to grow full
<PB N="328" REF="338">
three inches in depth, or thickne&s;s. There are &s;everal of the&s;e layers, one upon another, but always &s;eparated by a layer of mud. The lower kinds are as hard as &s;tone, and, therefore, the &s;alt-breakers, to &s;ave trouble, will only take the &s;alt from the &s;urface, which is not cru&s;ted.</P>
<P>This lake has long &s;ince been made known to the Ru&s;&s;ians, inhabitants of the Wolga, by the Kalmucks; who, as long as the &s;alt was free to be collected, &s;up|plied them&s;elves with it. After it became a prerogative of the Crown, it was conveyed, in 1771, to the Imperial &s;alt-marts at A&s;trachan, and other places. They fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;alt-mart on the Achtuba, at the di&s;tance of 24 miles; but this mart was afterwards removed to a much more di&s;tant place, 37 miles; for which the car|riers received three copecs a pud. The chief &s;alt-factor is a merchant of T&s;chernojar&s;kaja, and pays, at pre|&s;ent, only two and a half copecs per pud, which the carrier mu&s;t pay. The &s;alt is far better than that of the lake Elton, and more productive to the public revenue.</P>
<P>The Kalmucks relate, in their ridiculous legends, that, one day, their Delai-Lama having taken his dinner in this place, and thrown on the ground what remained of his &s;allad-&s;auce, it produced this lake, which has gradually increa&s;ed ever &s;ince; and that the mountain has been al&s;o enlarged to its pre&s;ent &s;ize, from Delai-Lama's, taking his re&s;t thereon by night.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="339">Immediately at the foot of Mount Bogdo, on the edge of the de&s;ert, at Saikol, the Troughmenian Tar|tars, &s;ubject to the Kalmucks, have their habitations. They are &s;aid to have been fir&s;t &s;ettled in this country, by <HI>Sai&s;&s;in Chorlin,</HI> who came fir&s;t into the territory of the Moguls in Ru&s;&s;ia, in 1593, with 50, 000 Kibitkas, or families, and 300 Troughmenian families, whom he picked up on the way: others think it was later.</P>
<P>The round-leafed rhapontic, or rhubarb, grows plen|tifully on the ea&s;tern precipice of this mountain, and on the whole alaba&s;ter rock. The Kalmucks &s;eek ea|gerly for the roots, which grow on this &s;acred &s;pot; and often take &s;ecret journies to collect them, particularly as the plant is not be found we&s;t of the river Wolga. They u&s;e it as a tea, and take it as a medicine. There are, al&s;o, a number of other fine plants, too tedious to mention here.</P>
<P>Not far from this mountain, the Co&s;&s;acks of my e&s;cort, who were moving the &s;tones lying about on the ground, brought me the fir&s;t &s;corpion that has been &s;een in the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. The&s;e conceal them&s;elves among the dry &s;tones, are &s;mall, and of a peculiar &s;pecies; but exactly like tho&s;e I have &s;een brought from Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bykof,</HI> in a botanical excur&s;ion he made ea&s;t|wards, from this di&s;trict to the de&s;art Naryn, in 1773,
<PB N="330" REF="340">
at 11 miles from Tologoi Kol, met with, in the &s;tep, a pyramid, built with bricks by the Kalmucks, but much decayed, called, by them, <HI>Schorolg&uuml;n-Balga&s;un</HI> (the earthen city).</P>
<P>Having now fulfilled the de&s;ign for which I was &s;ent out, and nearly completed my &s;ix years tour, I determined to go the neare&s;t way home, and make the be&s;t of my road to Mo&s;cow; of cour&s;e, the re&s;t of my journal will not contain any thing remarkable, having been travelled over and explored by Profe&s;&s;ors <HI>Gmelin</HI> and <HI>Gulden&s;tadt.</HI> Mr. <HI>Georgi</HI> having returned with the la&s;t &s;now through Ca&s;an, I &s;et out for Mo&s;cow, with all my &s;tudents and attendants, on the 4th of June, 1774; and reached the city of Tambof, on the 20th. Tam|bof is &s;ituated on the Zna, is an epi&s;copal &s;ee, or pro|vincial regency, contains 16 pari&s;h-churches, 10,000 inhabitants, an important, annual fair, cloth manu|factories, and excellent trade&s;men: here I continued three days. Between this, and Mo&s;cow, the country is embelli&s;hed with the &s;eats of the nobility and gentry. In my way, we &s;hot a milk-white bird, of that &s;pecies called blackbird; and one black, &s;potted with white.
